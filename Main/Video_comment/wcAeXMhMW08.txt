Help me find part 2 please!!!
I’ve been catching up on your videos and never thought I’d enjoy the challenge related one but now I gotta know with doing the camping trip in the Smoky Mountains- have you considered or are you planning to hike the whole Appalachian Trail?
29:56 not the party strobe😆
“A flizard”
Can't seem to find part2 any help please?
I hate wispering noise. Annoys me.
Where is part 2?
1 pot thinks giving sounds amazing
I would love to see a pack list 👀
The physical challenge videos are the best!
20:02 perfect pronunciation of Chana masala 👌👌.. jk luv u Kara and Nate ❤❤😊😊
so do rick and bec have an older child?
Boars 16:27 are dangerous... but not really here in the Smokies... theyre no where near as big as the pigs in the deep south. Which in turn means theyre not as agressive.
You guys 9:40 are being dramaticcc af. For people who dont live here, bears are harmless. Idk the last time, or if ever, ive heard of a black bear attacking humans... the most is tearing up your trash cans or your food from the back packs...
I looooove living vicariously through you guys!   Thank you for every video you have made to help me travel away from USA in 2025😢.   You guys are awesome!  Excited to see how 2025 opens up for yall this year!   I know you have plans behind the scenes… I’m the one that has seizures too!  I have them in clusters tho.  Thanks for your positive and informative corner of YouTube.
Anyone know where part 2 is😭
i'd love for ya'll to do the Appalachian trail but with Kara's condition it probably wouldn't be possible/safe in one go.
Kara is something else and I mean this whole heartedly, she’s amazing and Nate, you’re indestructible. Love you both! 🤓
lol I use my hammock and  top fly with fly net.
WHY PURIFY SPRING WATER ?
IF THE WATER IS COMING OUT OF A PIPE, IT IS USUALLY SPRING WATER.
Little does this Nate know he’s going to run 100 miles!
YOU MUST HAVE AN ANGEL , OTHER THAN CARA, WATCHING OVER YOU. THE STEPS ON THAT TOWER ARE TOTALLY ROTTEN.
I’ve lived on the mountain, at the foot of the mountain and always around mountains, and I’ve never seen a view like the sunrise you saw. I need to go hiking before I can’t anymore ❤
Hi Colin , a site or something, where people are asking for help ! To fix there boats? Hope u get time to reply❤
Hi Colin , can u give me abit of advice please? If u have time ? I want to learn about boats! How to fix them , and in time maybe learn to sail !! Haha abit of a dream ! But that’s were the passion & dedication comes in ! I’m in the UK 🇬🇧! Out of work, and 2 grown up kids ! I would like to change there destiny’s by getting them in to seeing the world from a different way of life ! So is there a site or anywhere I can look for a job to learn about working & helping on boats please! ❤
Hi guys! I love watching u 2 ! So funny & so positive, ❤
You two are everyone’s relationship goal! So sweet towards each other. So much love and care
I would have put the bags on the roof 😂
Excellent video.  Inspirational AND educational.   Not sensationalizing like those so called solo campers and bush crafters out frolicking around in extreme weather.  Be careful handling tent pegs with bare hands and crossing streams with bare feet.  Use rocks or wood to push the stakes in and invest in a pair of lightweight water shoes for ad hoc crossings.  Best of luck and keep on having fun.
Is it werid that I am a 15 girl old girl loving these videos ? ❤
A flizzard... hahaha ahhhhh, I love Kara.
I actually love these videos
I love you so much ❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️😘😘❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
I slept in a cabin in the NWT where the mice ran over my head all night long… every night for 5 nights. It was a fly in fishing trip. I slept in the boat during the day. 😅
Shesh.. I would just love to hike from Cannon beach to seaside, OR again. Sorry I didn't look up how far that hike is. But I remember it being beautiful!
Sounds like a blast.
I am sorry, but that adorable pat you did to Karas butt, literally I saw me and my husband in that moment. That moment means so much, those were love pats 😭.
If Bec was pregnant in 2001/2002, does that mean she has another kid that's like 22/23 now?
Hey Nate!  I need another of your physical challenge videos!
@8:56-ish that was a Sasquatch following y'all in the woods!! Very classic behavior! Something huge you can't see but hear out getting closer! It's following you! Things get quiet! Pigs are a great food source for them! And @22:02 I clearly hear 2 wood knocks!! Typical Squatch behavior!! I'd say you were followed the entire time!✌🐢
U look like ronaldo
I'm a next door neighbor to you guys in NC!  Our mountains are soooo beautiful!  Almost caught up with your channel after binging the last three weeks!  Only one year behind now!  Yayyy!
From some one who has camped for many days in the Smokies (I'm from East Tennessee), bears do indeed know how to climb trees and get bags that hang from a rope.
Looks like such a beautiful walk. You should come tramping in New Zealand you don't need to worry about bears or snakes. The worst would probably be a wild pig but I'm yet to see one.
Do Rick and Bec have a YouTube channel?!
I would love to see you guys document the entire appalachain trail
Where was that fire tower?
They are very fun to watch
This may be my favorite video! You guys are so fun to watch!
You guys should look into the mythical words 'dispersed camping' 😍  Those two words only lead to magic.
I somehow stumbled across your channel a few days ago and have been binging ever since!! I am the opposite of adventurous but your videos are so well done, I can't stop watching. Thank you for all your dedication and hard work! <3
i wanna do this, wow
Any body else see tops and g-dragons name in the back
Am I going mad? I can't find the second part of this 😞
Where is part 2 of this video? it's not linked.
how old are u ?
It’s so hard to believe that this is what you do for a living
Great call for Rocky Top to blow up a mattress
Does it have settings? … 🪩🎉🍾🥳🎊🪅💥
I will say this , if you are going deep into woods, you should always have a gun with you!  You seriously never know what you are going to run into, I have watched so many youtubers,  who have heard something potentially dangerous, or been attacked,  please be safe and vigilant,  I am almost caught up with your videos, it has been such an amazing journey,  that you have shared with us! God Bless you both, and all your friends and family!  Stay well and safe! Yes wild hogs are EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, please all always be careful!
I love these kinds of "survivor" type videos. Loved the raft collaboration, the island survivor, the Canadian survivorship. They are fun to watch and give ideas on what to bring or pack on your edc packs.
I love kara
Do this with emoen and bec
I’d rather spend my time watching you guys than any show
As someone who lived in the Appalachian Mountains for years hearing Nate say it the not Southern way hurt my soul.😅💔
Potato filling is a Pennsylvania Dutch recipe from Lancaster County area
Ive been watching you guys since last year and absolutely love you!  I wish i had the energy, youth and physical ability you two have.  I cant help but imagine doing the things you do with no fear. I watch in horror thinking of the bugs and snakes and bears you might encounter!  I love the scenery but i could never be in so much pure nature. Thank you for making the videos so i can see it through your eyes.
not another one of nates physical challenge videos
I like there vids like this
The more that I think about it, kara reminds me of Jenna marbles. And I love that😂 anyone else see it?
How do you survive mosquitoes?
Omg I love the great smoky mountains 😊
That view was stunning 😳🥰. What a fun adventure!! 🙅‍♀️
Does the chapstick mean the bears are attracted to Karas lips? 💋😂
Great place to go hiking.  When you're on the trail you learn to appreciate everything, especially when you're with someone you love. The view is better than the hike! 🧐🌲👍
This is funny because my last name is woods and I will never survive there even though I love this life style
I heard to not wear flavored chapstick in those shelters bc the mice like to lick it 😅
For some reason I watched this and thought of you doing RAGBRAI again. Any chance you can call  Dusty and your other friend and do it again? Loved it.
Hikers are so cringe these days
Impressimng to carry a shelter in a backpack.
Wow very nice video. Awesome. Stay Safe
I live in Murphy North Carolina the great Smoky Mountains!!!!!😮😮😮😊 if you don’t mess with the Bears they won’t mess with you trust me my dad hunts bears for food!!!!! You’ve never seen a salamander before!?!? What, they’re all over our pond in the summer!!!!😢😮 same thing with boars if you don’t bother them they won’t bother you!!😊 my dad also kills boars through nuisance!!
Shouldn’t you not be cooking in the shelter if there is a bear warning? Or did you cook somewhere else?
Pigs smother themselves in mud to A keep cool B to scrub tics and parasites off C to keep from getting sunburned
A filzzard 👏👏👏👏👏
Where is part 2
https://youtu.be/j6QXZ_TC4KM
get Lume deodorant ... its for feet pits and crotch... safe for vags, made by a gyno. stops odor for up to 73 hours. great for camping ect
Kara is so sweet and Kate is so annoying. I can’t stand how much energy he has to do so much. Seems like he always has fear of missing out!
Where's part two? Love you all.
I appreciate that you support wildlife a lot ty
So when are yall gonna section hike the whole trail?
A Flisard.  LMAO Love it Kara.
Y’all’s videos bring me so much joy I love yall
I love the survival videos
I heard you talking about the Appalachian trail. My cousin hiked that whole thing with a fake leg! And, about halfway through a screw, that acted as his ankle, fell out. So he had to order basically go buy a replacement ankle!
That is so awesome that is literally from my hometown, that's where we always go when it snows or when it's pretty weather. My husband took my oldest daughter up there for there 1st time in her life last year before he passed away. I have so many memories in and at that fire tower thank you for sharing your experience with us. I would add the picture but I don't know how but I will make it as my main pic. Lol❤
And wow I'm gonna have to ok try those p.b. & chocolate chip tortillas yes yum yay lol
I just freaked out a bit when I wondered if what yall sat on was oak or ivy😢 I SURE HOPE NOT🙏 (and also while yall were on the tower (at sunset) I was having a bit of safety & anxiety issues😢 durring it all).. I guess it would have been no for me., but wow sorta love all that hiking, creeks, "tent" air beds, tent camping, coffee and all yes looks like & is so much fun I know yes..
😂Lol the scarry music part got me Lol😂 but I seriously would be having that knife out the whOle😮 time lol
What does AG1 taste like..?
I just have to bathe more often.
I liked this video
I knew this was the smokies from a glance of the video. Love the smokies.
nate used to have so much hair😭 14:09
As a country girl, I would always suggest that you make a lot of noise as you hike through the Appalachian trails. Most of the animals (wild hogs, bears, fox, etc...) will not bother you and steer clear if they know that you are around them.  Most of the attacks arise from startled animals.
Someone needed to introduce these people to the Appalachian lady from tik tok.. if you see it, no you didn't. If you hear it, no you didn't.
I’m from nc ❤️ spent 3 summers raft guiding near there. Love seeing y’all in such a familiar place
Good luck
I always love seeing Nate making Kara’s coffee first thing in the morning, their relationship is just immaculate
nearly half way through the vid when u were showing us pictures of u and Kara u kind of look like Adam Sandler in the orange t shirt 😅
I wanna know where she gets her shirts from they are all so cute i need one so badly
The Appalachian Trail is a name calling back to the mountains name it is the Appalachian Mountains and it runs right through where I live Pennsylvania
I went to the smokey mountains and it's so beautiful there
What kind of filtering bottle is this? Could you add a link for that & the heating pot you used for your coffee & oatmeal.
Nate intimidating voice:  “HEY BEAR ..HEY BEARRR” 😂😂
My husband and I flew round trip from Wichita, KS to Amsterdam, Netherlands last summer ALL with points (United)  plus stayed downtown In Amsterdam central (using Marriott points) 🎉🎉
The ending of this video made me laugh so hard! So cute! Love you two
9:05 The more you fuck around=the more you find out, and Nate was like, "NOT TODAYYY"😂😂
"not another fitness challenge 😜" personally I LOVE the fitness challenge videos. Your Ragbrai video gave me the push I needed to complete my first Ragbrai last year 😁 keep doing things that bring you joy 💚
I tried to go hiking once 😂😂 there was a snake that went right across the train tracks... turned my happy self back around and went to car. Proud to say I walked for 1 minute 😂😂😂😂
As always enjoy you Vlogs.  You can Hike the AT sections one at a time and get a degree if it is done within 1 year. I did maintenance on a part of the trail in N.Y. It's easy one step at a time. Yes it is 2200 but it is a experience that will never leave you mind and sole.                    TAKE  CARE  ALL
Wild boars are very dangerous they can slit your leg open with there tusks when they run by they also bite
Anyone else inspire to live like them ?
Omg y'all were in the smokies. It's one of my most favorite places in the world.
the veiws between 23:30 and 24:10 made me cry. i dont know why. i gues sim just a sucker for nature.
Ok weird thing but which way would you do you Reese’s peanut butter in a tortilla. Would you do it the way Kara does it with the peanut butter first and then the chocolate or the way Nate does it with the chocolate then the peanut butter??? lol luv ur vids!! 💗💗
Natureee... thatssss neat 😂🫶2:16 Omg I've laughed hard several times in this video. besides the flash back of Nate hanging the bags where the bear can still get it to this PB shot I'm hooked 12:16 so grommet 😂 26:47 How amazing is our lives!!! Agreed. I'm truly thankful every day, I get a car to drive, good heathy good options, and my friends and family around me, (well those who wish to be around me HAHA)
Very selfish knowing her fear and you eating her food! This is the rudest I’ve seen Nate
Where can I find a filtering water bottle like y'alls? I need to get one. Also, love your videos! Y'all make me want to get out and travel more
Every time i see these i get so happy that i live where in the province of PEI and have no bears or wild pigs or anything that can essentially hurt someone
Bro you  stood in the woods for 120 hours wow
the first video i watched was the 72 hour island survival and i love these videos no matter what its about
This is a great video, but far to many ads
Couple goals  so inspiring
Let me hear something following me in the woods. Bigfoot yall
At 9:10 my brain was just screaming "make a lot of noise so the bears don't get you"
Kara, you deserve an award.  I know it's been an amazing ride; but hat's off to you hanging in there for each of Nate's back-to-back wild adventures.  It's amazing what the two of you have accomplished.  Happy Travels.........
Watching and hearing Nate hit his head for a second time on the window had me cracking up.
I love you guys and your adventures so much! I hope you guys tackle the entire AT soon! The AT runs through our tiny town in the Smokies. And I would happily meet you at a junction to replace supplies, etc. But for the love of all things Holy, say it with me “App-uh-latch-un”. 😉❤
Kara needs her coffee
I live for your B-roll and humor.  Y'all come across as so transparent/real about your experiences.  And your production value is amazing in addition to that.  Thank you for sharing with us!
I hope Kara appreciates what Nate goes thru to get her morning coffee. ❤ I trust she does.
The compression in this one is brutal.
I love this
okay I'm new but holy cow I can barely get out of bed and y'all are doing THIS
Please, you all, you are one of my fav YouTubers. Say it with me, App-uh-latch-un. Sorry, the pronunciation just gets me. I lived in these mountains my whole life, and every time I watch a video of someone on the Appalachian trail, they’re saying it all wrong.❤love y'all either way though!
Sometimes I convert there videos to hear them talk and when bored in subway after work.
26:05 It looks like you're sitting in poison ivy.
I enjoyed this one, and would like to see more like it. The physical challenge ones stress me out.
As a fan of Mr Ballen as well... I’m thinking of all the things that can go wrong during your hike 😂 though I know you both are fine since I’m watching this vid
Beautiful Video, love that Tower Spot, gorgeous views! Just might add that whole Trail to my List, I never knew it existed. Y'all take Care!
They don't get enough credit for how funny they are. The end when Kara was trying to kiss Nate without inhaling had me cracking up.
You’re my favorite adventure couple!!!
Hey guys, you both amazing and I’m obsessed with watching your vlogs. I’m curious to what water bottle you are using to filter the water?! Love to get one myself! Keep being amazing! Thank you for your videos!
The smoky mountains are one of the most beautiful ranges, truly a highlight of Tennessee
You call videotaping yourselves the whole time "completely disconnected"? Cute.
So much love for y'all. Thanks for letting us be apart of your lives!
Hello I'm watching your video always god bless I'm here philipines❤️❤️❤️🙏🇵🇭
I LOVE YOUR VIDS SO MUCH AND HOPE YOU GET ME TO BE IN YOUR VIDS
Who watches the baby while you're gone?
Not another one of Nate’s challenge videos😂💀
Kara is a pro at giving a loving jab to Nate hahah 17:38 "Your snoring...is going to be RIGHT here.........good thing we love each other :D"
Thank you for taking us on a beautiful hiking trip.
G-dragon 🤣
19000000000000000⁰000000000000ⁿ00000000000🧘🙅🏍️🏁🏁🍑😭🧘🧘🛌🤬😱
Come to Maine and try some lobstah! 🦞 🌲 😊
love these videos with you in nature as a married couple and Kara 👣🧐
I forgot how incredible that view is. I'm from East TN but I'm living in San Diego right now and when I saw the first glimpse I teared up.
Nate, I feel like you are the luckiest Man on the planet to have a partner like Kara. Kara, i feel like you are the luckiest Woman on the planet to have a partner like Nate
14:08 - Such a great haircut! :)
“Coffee waffle, and Kara “ “Third” lol 😂
You guys made me try ag1 I don’t like the taste maybe I’m not in to the healthy drinks😂
I live in those mountains....would not trade it for the world
Mount cammerer tower is absolutely beautiful. Loved that hike
you guys are always near where i live at times and i never know!!
16:08 🤣😅😂
Can you guys share your camping equipments (stove, tent etc)
Nate is the most romantic person, making Kara coffee every morning (regardless of location/method).
Lol...loved the "We need a break" I thought you guys were on one? I loved to have a break like that...for years too.😱
I was scrolling on YT during pandemic and landed on to your channel! Kara and Nate has inspired me and my partner to travel more when we have the budget and time. I was inspired to film our journey as well. Could you do like a behind the scene of how you capture your videos? 🙂 And what gears do you use? 🥰
"WHAT AN INTERESTING TECHNIQUE," said I when Nate put the chocolate chips first, then tried (successfully!) to spread the PB on top.
What is with Kara and her smelly feet! Whew!
Love watching you all hike! My dream to hike the AT
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. And your. Channel
Were on the application trail because I hiked over the summer up a mountain that was really cool called mount kinsman and there was something called rockscramballing which is climbing straight up on rocks and my group hiked 12 miles in three days
What was your path for this hike? What trails did you take? What fire tower is this?
I thought i recognized that shelter. Why don’t y’all  do the Triple Crown of hiking!!! ….the Appalachian Trail, Pacific Crest Trail and Continental Divide Trail! Now that’s an epic journey❤❤
My little brother did this hike that started in Georgia. Almost bailed out because the weather turned to real cold & snow,  But 1 day later back to sun & warm. They gave me the name " Milkman " yes he drank a lot of milk.     Love that your steaming so we can watch !!!
You say you only have to walk 6 miles or something but how many miles do you actually walk to get all camera shots?!!
Is no-one gonna talk about when Nate spilled hot water on himself and he went OW then Kara went Aw aRe yOu oK 😂
Looks like carpathians in Ukraine
Great video just living life well done very casual unlike your other video rushing about and challenged stay cool UK
“we typically eat pretty healthy in our day to day life…” lies Kara!! Liessssss 😂😂😂
Ever seen the movie Backcountry? The telegram reply below is a scammer.
🌻👌🏻🌼
I have a feeling you two have never seen Wrong Turn. lmao
Loved this video but that flimsy ass tower made me wanna vomit idk how y’all did it hahahahah
I just about threw up on the tower scenes. That would freak me out... happy trails!
My fear is going hungry too
Awesome video! That sunrise was GORGEOUS !! Safe travels :)
Lmaoo it’s the fact that Nate said he splurged.. love you guys so much!! Please continue to be safe and creating great content! 💗💗💗💗
They say that everything here in Australia will kill you, but honestly, I'd be terrified of the bears you have in America just wandering around the bush. I reckon we're much safer here. Also, I love the term Kara invented - Flizard.
Next time you two are in canada you should come to bc and do the west coast trail! Definitely up your alley!
I'm a chicken, I'd be sleeping up in that tower.  Hahaha
You two are so brave!  i refuse to go back into the woods.  no way!  Too many bears and too many Sasquatch!!!
I’m 32.5 years older than the two of you = 65. I cannot tell you how appreciative I am to be able to live vicariously through you and go on all of these wonderful adventures. I’ve been following you for years and you keep getting better and better. Your editing is unrivaled, your content never disappoints. Please keep doing what you’re doing, you’re adored by so many of us.
I think its interesting that I've been to the Great Smoky Mountains so many times that I knew where you guys were at just by the Low Gap trailhead.
Hey, did you celebrate Canadian Thanksgiving?
Man, when you encountered boar, my heart stopped, you two have been to NZ years ago, but if you were to ask This Kiwi what is one thing she doesn't want to run into in our bush, it would be Captain Cookers, they are descendants from the pigs who came over with Captain Cook on his voyage, and they are mean.   I don't like to use anamorphic terms for animals, but cookers? Mean, ugly, angry pigs from heck. My friend likes to hunt them (they're a real problem here because they cause destruction to the bush and eat a lot of native birds' eggs because NZ had no mammalian predators, so all our birds went, "Sweet as bro, I'll nest on the ground, she'll be mint! - unfortunately, now it is very not mint).  So you can do a bit to help the environment and get rid of them, not to mention if you know how to work with the meat, it will be the best crackling you've ever had. So, we got a couple of pig dogs doing their job and finding us a Cooker. So, I'm in there with my mates, and they tell me if you see a Cooker, and he is coming for you, run and gets up a tree, and I'm laughing thinking, oh, there's no way a pig would climb a tree to get me, but a boar on the other hoof.  I was very wrong because a boar is not just a giant old pig. This big male came with massive tusks and a hulking body took one look at the 5'10 Aucklander and thought, "I can take her". And he tried, now I can't climb. I wouldn't say I like heights; I climbed two metres off the ground as he got up on his hind legs and still tried to get me.   My friend managed to draw his attention and eventually took him out, in a very much, me or the pig kind of way. To this day, I have never ever compared a Cooker to a pig again, so I had a nervous giggle when Kara asked if boar were dangerous.  Hope you both had a fantastic time on your hike looked like a lot of fun and what a great way to spend time together.
So I’m confused..if chap stick attracts bears and has to be put high in the trees, is it the best idea to wear it for the night time?😮😅.
I love the like at the same time, but glad you’re grateful in the sense of the reset.
Watching this late. But I swear to God, when we visited the smokey mountains, we heard something. It sounded way to large to be a bear. And there was rhythmic knocking. Wtf. We have zero idea what it was. We didn't stick around to find out. Crazy things are there.
Awesome video! God bless. Always remember that Jesus Christ loves you all so much! Jesus Christ forgives all sins. Jesus Christ is God, King, and Savior!❤️🙏
Could have set up your tent in the shelter. lol
I love this channel so much
I love y’all’s vids they are so cool and they make me relaxed. You guys are amazing.❤️❤️
Your physical challenge videos are the best. Don't stop pushing yourself and trying to be the best you can be. 💪🤘
Such a kind young lady Blessings . I would never hike in the woods ever , to scary . Maybe with a gun lol its beautiful . Nate is such an amazing adventurer
Wow 🙌🙏💯🥰 hey I moved here to TN from wa state! Do you guys know of a cool spot to camp in a dad van? That has a creek or river n short walk to a water fall? I’m disabled now n have a lil 6year old lady bug n used to do this stuff back In The day, but I’m new here so wondering if ya know of an area in the Smokey’s that kinda cool like this vid but for a broken old dad to take the ladybug to n camp in our lil mini van! We went to gatlinberg n was fun but was soooo busy! Looking for something kinda like this 🙏
Nate should let Kara talk
One question, what kind of peanut butter and chocolate chips do you guys use?
What model of tent did you use for this trip?
Nate, you will have no problem carrying a toddler on your back after this! No pressure, tho, lol! ETA I swear I had no idea there would be baby-conception talk!
Your channel is amazing keep up the good work and I tell a lot of people Jesus loves you 😃🙏
Cool video I haven't seen a video like this before I seen videos something like your guys's video but your video is very interesting I'm enjoying and loving this video it's sad to hear those bears around ☹️ hope you guys are going to be okay how many were here I describe to your channel I love nature 🌳🌻🌼🌾🍁🍀🌴 and my favorite color is green and my eyes are green lol 🤗😃
I find it soooo weird that you (Nate) get so excited at the possibility of a wild animal being close by. Chill out on the thrill seeking.
Honestly, I prefer digging a hole to sitting on a seat that other strangers butts have been on.
u guys are for real my favorite thing to watch. you make me smile:)
Love how it doesn't matter where you are, Nate, you make coffee for Kara. Love your love for each other. And it's great seeing your appreciation for your surroundings. When you're looking around for bears and wild boars, it has a Blair Witch feel. Great video.
Whats your plan when you eventually have kids?
@ 16.8 was like a horror movie 🎬
I think Nate should edit the episodes he takes over…
Kinda annoying how he snatched the water out of her hands
boars are actually really dangerous if they have little babies with them, but if you keep a good distance away it’s fine. if you accidentally get too close, they don’t like loud noise so yelling or banging metal or something like that can help scare them/keep them away. theyre overall not as dangerous as bears, but once they feel threatened they can do their damage in a group of 3-4 boars already!  (living in germany we see them regularly in summer and fall)
I just saw g-dragon written
I have a big question, how Kara do with those travels and everything when she have her period ? How can you stay in the forest with period cramps and tampons ?
That tower gave me soooo much anxiety !😟😳I’m terrified of heights. If it’s higher than 25 ft and there’s no harness/cage/seatbelt involved it’s a big NO 🙅🏽‍♀️for me!
I live about 2 hours from the Smokies. Loved this video!
I loved this video✌️💜
you know, you could just take 441 through the Smokies!😁
My husband and I hiked the same trail and we loved it. We did primitive camping off trail in our hammocks w nets so we avoided rodents :) hope you enjoyed 🥰
You got a later start than anticipated, noooooooo, that doesn't sound like Kara and Nate are all lmao 😂♥️
25:32 Young Jim Carrey 😂
@Nate --> Kara, coffee, waffle (next time)
Bears use things suspended from ropes as piñatas, though
the smokies will always have a special place in my heart.
I've watched you guys travel all around the world, but my favorite is seeing y'all in the Smokies. I have so many memories of camping there myself. It's nice to see y'all enjoying home. ❤
Normal People hiking up there is a challenge but you guys get all the youtube shots and i appreciate it so much❤️
I love you two so much !!! And I love how much you love nature. I share that love of nature with you.
Toilet paper does not go in those pots there should be another separate bin for that
I never said something about it but Kara and I have the same name!
Ironically I just finished watching The Gabby potato story, right before I found this video.😳
It’s so cute that no matter where these guys are, Nate always makes Kara a coffee in the morning for when she wakes up. There’s just something so heartwarming about that🤍
As someone who did a weekend hike on AT, I loved the shelters except that I never slept good.
Proud of you pushing yourselves out of your comfort zones always. Like you a I didn’t grow up camping and there is a lot to get used to. And I also agree that we learn to appreciate the comforts of home when we are out exploring. Keep going.
You should try doing this in Australia in the right spots there is no risk when it comes to wild animals all are harmless unless put in danger. Possums are mostly all you’d need to worry about and just bc they will want your food
As always the editing on this channel is superior.  🎦
I love you both! Your Energy and vibe! I just wanna smother myself in your awesomeness! Thank you for sharing!
I ain't an conspiracy theorist but what do Kara and Nate try to subtly tell us?  Kara and Nate however nice and likeable they are, are part of a 'group', like  most 'successful' people. It makes sense as protection are needed so people can help each other fight for 'rights' hence networking leads to 'grouping'. Grouping leads to ideology. Ideology leads to doctrine which gives and to cult or philosophy.
what’s your friends channel where the hiked? cant find them
We have boars right outside our garden, I live in Italy, Genova, we are so used to them now!
From what I have learned, wild boar are not dangerous at all, except for these two cases:  1. you surprise them by walking silently for miles and suddenly encounter one  2. they have young ones (then they are extremely defensive and you should avoid meeting them).  My solution: make noise when walking (talking etc.) or do it like me if you are not sure if they heard you and just start clapping randomly.
Boars can literally rip your arse. The best prevention is making sure they know about you ahead of time. They rather make sure they avoid you instead of attacking you. The only danger are sows with piglets as they cannot avoid you as easily. The best defense is jumping up on a nearest tree and hold yourself there for a while. Knives are useless unless you have minimum 3 experienced hunting dogs with you against boars.
idk if im in the minority but I acc enjoy nates physical challenge videos
Nate, how many miles did you run on the cruise ship daily? You could clearly have packed more water containers and food along with the tarp. Consumables weigh less every day and you guys already knew you were dehydrated.
Awesome I hope to thru hike it next year! Yeah mice because people eat in the shelter the ATC says 100 ft away your not the only ones. The bear cables are just for food bags you whole backpack might be a bit much it seemed to work  Great to see you on trail maybe next year you will do a piece with me.
Just for future reference it's pronounced App-uh-latch-un Trail. Love you guys!
Need my workout time... Got go time...
its the littlest thing but i hope u guys know how much i appreciate the conversions of f to c, lbs to kg and miles to km. as an aussie it rlly helps me gage what u guys are feeling and how much youre walking and stuff. love always x
This video is so cool and a trail is named after my last name!
Not weird Nate, it was great, loved it!😁
Lol they took care of the stinky feet for the second night 😂
I feel bad for Kara … hard core wife supporting nates needs
I WOULD WATCH YOU AND KARA HIKE TO MAINE!!!! DOOO IT!!!
Loved y’all singing Rocky Top. Hope you get to stick around for the next game against Bama.
Absolutely lovely mountains and lovely people to go along with the scenery! ❤
I just have to put it out there that when they climbed the tower i was 99% sure it was going to turn into the movie “fall” on Netflix
It’s tusks (plural). And growing up in bush with Wild Boar I can tell you they are ONLY dangerous when startled. Many people hunt them so they have survival instincts. They will NOT hunt you and attack you however. They are herbivores. Definitely MUCH less dangerous than bears.
Fun fact: The Appalachian range actually extends all the way up to the northwest of Ireland and includes other parts of Europe and some of North Africa, as these were all connected as part of an ancient mountain range when the continents were all connected as Pangaea.
I love you guys so much❤
I really hope they both had a can of bear spray on them!!
What does the ag1 even taste like ? 😂
As soon as she opened the toilet and saw the stains inside... I cringed
Loved this video!!🥰
Kara where is your ramen peanut butter
Not mice, I would have shrieked and ran
Omg I love you guys so much I have a suggestion you schould go on the Disney wish if you like Disney stuff ❤
not g-dragon cameo LOL
I swear guys it big foot! Not joking littler watch finding big foot.
Camera
Flizzard💀
Why does it still sound like one of Nates challenges
I love how funny you are you got me laughing 4 times
Guys they’re black bears, relax. Just keep your food up and you’re fine
You are both so awesome and together you BOOM..glad you're doing the walk..nice👍👊
Lol..Kara's dry leg skin
Lol ... Kara's dry skin..she just used herself as a tray so
Pitch the tent in a shelter if needed
you found your morty
I'd be more worried about mountain people
I like Nate’s physical challenge videos!😂
Did y’all see the troll bridge and the fairy house?
GDRAGON WHAT R U DOIN HERE 🤣
I love the challenge vids as much as the rest of your content. Ignore those haters
Both of you have created many awesome & wonderful videos together.. you can spend 100 years watching it all over again. We should live a life as couple like you are doing it (before planning for little ones)
A flizzard. Love it.
Just a note that you need to make noise walking through the woods. I always put bells on my pack to warn animals I'm coming.
If you have planned your trip,  it's not relaxing.  It's a journey but not relaxing.
Who else got butterflies in their stomach???  Kara looked so nervous when they hear the rustling sounds 😮😮😮😮
I'm in TN and it is gorgeous, seen ton of wildlife and vreat scenery, but how do yall drive cause everyone in gaitlinburg is so rude. We can't he back up withoit 10 cars going by before we got let in.
You should perhaps get an inflation bag so that you don't inflate the mattress with your mouth as it is really easy to get mold growth in it from your moist breath and then get that in in your lungs and that can make you sick, which is not nice when hiking.
Guys y’all could have hidden the food from the bears on the tower
Really enjoyed this live nature so empressed with the sun set n sun raised such beautiful people and so funnie ❤
A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian...  Book by Bill Bryson is a great book for the trip, totally hilarious!!!  I agree with Kara's comment about being in the natural environment, it rejuvenates you and harnesses you.  I am in awe, therefore I am humbled by the experience.
Love you guys.  All your videos are fun and exciting to watch. Take care of your self.
Does anyone know the name of the tower or the mountain it is on?
nice time
Amazing Video, your videos are very interesting for my channel!
i love how both of you have different order of making that taco sandwich :D i personally would put peanut butter  first and then the chocolate chips :D
where di you get the water filter?
So much fun
Would you guys ever hike the Appalachian Trail ?
Completely disconnected from the world…..posts video on YouTube 😂
It also recharges your relationship! I love going camping and exploring with my boyfriend! It allows to disconnect from our day to day life and just focus on us ! Thank you for sharing your adventures and inspiring us for our future adventures!
Would love to see how u got the cable up the tree.
I hope u r going to stay in several clean cabins
https://youtu.be/1BqCiXDMb9E
I'm curious about the shoes you are wearing because they don't look like hiking boots. I like to not wear hiking boots. The heights on that look out tower were scary. I'm assuming you guys know if you are sitting in poison oak or something but that was my first thought when you sat in those leaves.
5:34 G-Dragon LOL iykyk
Jet Boil should have sponsored you!
You know, a collab with you two and the Outdoor Boys would be fun to watch.
I’ve followed you for over a year, and this is the first time where I felt genuine envy, the watchtower sunset date. Love it.
What are the shoes called that you guys have on in all your videos.
Looks like living in the woods for a few days is so much fun...
Seizure warning
Some of your videos are now going haywire. Wish you can start travelling overseas again.
What's wrong with physical challenge videos? Love them, you guys are great!!!!!!!!!
How did you guys meet? The guys that I meet that love adventure are total flakes. How do I meet someone that lives to travel without being noncommittal?
i love the physical challenge videos! u guys should make more
Are you serious I was literally just at Buckys and I think I was at the same place you guys were like a year ago and I would just got home today from the great Smoky Mountains at Tremont and now you guys are the best now you guys are at the smoky Mountains o  gosh.
does anyone know what kind of tent Kara and Nate have in this video? Thank you!!
yes. moar of dis please
Lol A salamander 😂
Hi Kara and Nate! I build you van in minecraft! It looks identical but with more blocks
Does the igniter not work on your jet boil?  You could have packed the tent footprint instead of the giant lighter.  😂
Seeing the part of the video with the tent and its light and shadows instantly reminded me of this scene from Austin Powers: https://youtu.be/oK2oR73TGP8
The anxiety for you looking out on the tower
As a long (& I mean LONG!) time viewer, it was cute to see you guys playing kissy face as you aren’t usually heavy handed on the PDA. 😄
You guys should do the triple crown in Virginia.  It's amazing. Dragons tooth is my favorite.
Pretty sure that your “normal” life is anything but normal. Just saying. . .
you guys are just so awesome. your love for each other is incredible
What snacks do you buy usually?
I love you guys..
To me you guys are nature navy seal
Hi Kara and Nate recently my dad has passed away watching your guys videos makes me so happy and take things off my mind please keep filming great videos and thank you for making me feel great keep up the good work 👍👍❤️❤️
"Third"
We are doing the Sydney tower eye skywalk next month for our honeymoon. Have you ever done that? It’s so high you have to be strapped to wall in order to go out on the deck. Definitely going to be an experience!
Oh goodness….that tower would make me so scared 😂
Comes up to you’re knees?? Pfffff Nate when I was 16 I was with my parents on a camping park in Fréjus in the south of France and that camping had 2 parts! A slope/mountain thingie with tents and then a big field with nothing but a lot of trees around it and a small road…..and then a kind of RV park on the other side, I walked with 5 others (all being cool teenagers) from the tent side to the RV side…..when out of nothing 1 of the girls saw a little baby hog 3 meters to the left….she was walking to it! Nooooo before she was 1 meter further we could hear mama hog (and about 10 papas/uncle/aunts and cousin hogs) SCREAM! I have never been that fast in my life! The field was to big, we would not have won the running from the hogs……but in the middle of the field was a playground area with a big and high slide 🛝set. We climbed on it all together and we spend about 2 hours on top of it! And the floor of that slide set was about 2 meters of the ground and 1 of the hogs could touch the floor of it with its nose and teeth!!!!!! Ohhhhh so scary! Now it is an amazing story ❤️ also because i kissed my holiday boyfriend a few days later on top of the playground set for the first time (he thought I was such a bad ass 😂😂😂)  But my point is…….they are so BIG and AGRESSIVE! 😊😳😎   😬😘
you couldve put a tent in the shelter thingy
You guys! I only found you because I had to check the captions on your videos, but I love y’all! Don’t know if you plan to return to Europe, but you guys have a bed in Lyon, France.
I love these types of videos! Surley you can make more of these wonderful videos I would agree that everyone enjoys these! Keep doing what your doing it’s great!
I love this video so much. How awesome it is to see you both out on trail! And One Pot Thanksgiving Dinner...heck yes! I put together a recipe for a version of that on my YouTube Channel: https://youtu.be/drOR4GF9HsU
Hi Kara and Nate, I'd love to learn more the travel gear that you used, like the portable stove and water filter.  Please consider providing links in your part two video.  My favorite day hike in the Smokies is Alum Cave to Mount Leconte.  I've never been on the trails that you're exploring here.  You can also go further to what I think is called Cliffside Overlook.  I hope that you enjoy the rest of your stay!  (and yes, I heard that the shelters aren't nice; sometimes the mice attract snakes)
When are you guys gonna get back to regular international travel beyond the continent of North America?
I love you all live in TN. I love the Smokey's!!
Someone wrote "GDragon" on the beam and I'm living for it. Hes a kpop artist.
“A flizard. 😂
APP-A-LATCH-UN
We are still waiting for a Kara OF account
That sunrise was magnificent and magical with the clouds tucked into the mountains
We love backpacking! We try go often as we can here in Wyoming
Nate bring back the curls! 🤩
It's only a matter of time before Kara and Nate tackle the entire Appalachian Trail...hopefully we see more backpacking videos again soon
Hello from Turkey 🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻please advise which model camera and lens are used. 📸
Y'all look like you're having a blast!
Good for you guys! I had a week retreat in the mountains also. I wimped out on a cabin with no wifi. I love you guys and the Great Smokies. That sunrise with Java! That's a moment.
if kara has a fear of being hungry, she should try fasting for a week or couple days
i love your laughing its very pure and i can see the love on the way you look at each other
My brother is involved with the AMC, I hope you check out the northern section soon!
I want a compilation of all the views where Kara and Nate say this is the best view ever lol!
You guys should have bear bells on your backpacks and always carry bear spray ! Ypu shpuld make as much noise as possible when walking through the woods so as not to take a bear or wild cat by surprise.  If you sneak up on them it can end very bad. Be safe you two !
The quality of the filming and edit in this video is next level, even for you guys. It's honestly more of a short film than a typical youtube vlog video. I think it's a big part of why your content is so good and your subs and views have grown so much.
As someone whose rings fit loose, it gave me so much anxiety watching Kara brush off her hands above the pit toilet. Update:  that fire tower!! OMG my stomach dropped everytime they showed how wobbly and unsafe it is
Hogs can’t sweat so they lay in mud to cool their bodies down so they don’t over heat and die
The thriller music had me on edge 😅😅😅
I  ❤your melaeeeeee😊
Spending time in the woods is absolutely amazing, as a person who comes from the hills, i can totally relate. Sometimes i feel blessed for being from the homeland of waterfalls, clouds, caves , sacred groves, living root bridges and more. I totally enjoyed watching your vlog guys ❤️😍❤️ love from Meghalaya,. India
Glad you didn't get attacked by 30-50 wild hogs
Mountain miles are so different from flat walking miles 😅 it’s never ending hahaha
How do you do those map animations? After Effects?
You two are brave.
⛺️ ⛰️ 🐖 🐻
Needing a break? All those vacations must be tough.
Your cave hotel video was in a Mr. Beast video by the way!
Very off the grid uploading on yt nice one
I personally think Nate should bring back the curly hair
As a metric user, I very much appreciate the distance and weight conversions.
I live in Tennessee and I went camping at Cosby campground too Aug 27 when did y’all go, there was a bear warning when I went too
Flizerd🤣😂
I love the physical challenge videos!!!
7:50 the g-dragon written on the wood frame good to see made me laugh😁
waiting for AG1 to ship to Singapore!!! :D
Nate I say u get a gun
Future AT thru hikers? That would be the ultimate mental & physical endurance test!
YOU GUYS ARE SO CUTE!!!!! I feel so happy every time watching your video awww! Also the clouds during sunset omg I kept going back to watch it! My first time seeing such a beautiful scene! Thanks for capturing it so well!
Nate how dare you go into   the woods with bears with no firearm and to put that super hot wife of yours in harm's way.
This was awesome
You two are crazy
29:55 lol the reactions were really funny and the edit was really funny 😄😂
“A flizard” 😂 I love it Kara!
My dad completed the whole AT this year, he’s did it in 6 months after wanting to do it for over 10 years
Kara… your idea of this… is amazing!!! Do more like this!!
So as a native East Tennessean, who has lived in all "3 states" of Tennessee (East, Middle and West) Nate hurt my southern soul by saying Appalachian as Appa-Lay-Shun instead of Appa-latch-un. Love you guys though! Keep up the great work. If you ever want to learn to curl in the great smoky mountains hit me up!
Is there not any Kara and Nate merch??? WE NEED KARA AND NATE MERCH!
It’s only a squwatch
This is why I can’t hike in Tennessee by myself😂 The entire time I’m like you guys hearing whatever that is making the noise ( haven’t got that far yet) it’s so dense!
Y’all are the best!! I just love y’all, no matter what video, no matter where y’all go, it’s just so good!!! The view tower was spectacular🙌🏼 The clouds rolling through was phenomenal!!! Can’t wait for the next video! Happy trails🥾 Stay you ✌🏼
"App-uh-latch-un" - Great video! Love you guys!
I get what Kara is feeling about going hungry. I get major food insecurity/ anxiety if I don't have available food. I think Covid quarantine brought it on as we only would order online groceries the first couple months.
Hiked a portion of the AT near Johnson City, TN this past spring….absolutely stunning!
I love how you both a mental set of appreciation for the life that you have offer because it is easy to forget the things that others may not have. Thank you for making this video and other videos amazing! Makes me wanna travel around the world just like you guys.
Loved the Rocky Top in the middle of all of this!  lol!
I will never get sad of watching you two!! I totally started with your international travel and totally enjoy ALL the food recommendations!!! ! But, I got super invested with van life, and now super excited that your back here in the states 🤣
I love Nate's physical challenge videos tho :( it motivates me. I love this too!
Would love to know where you got all your gear..... Specifically your backpacks and sleeping bags. Thank you! My girls (10 and 11) and I  love your videos and we all watch them together! Thank you for great videos!
I’m surprised y’all say appa-lay-shin being from Tennessee. As a north east tennessee’er it’s “appa-latch-in” haha 😊
Smokey's are magical.loved it!!
Is this a jetboil ad? If so, I’m sold!
How is hiking 31 miles taking it easy?  😂
Don't get eaten by Skinwalkers ❤️
Bring back the bloopers at the end of every video!
I love you guys # best YouTubers ever
Lol not the quarter dome tent
I love the vlogs where you start to get punchy and things get a little weird! Cue Kara giggling and awkward kissing 😅
Because of you two specifically, I've been hiking more than I ever have! Thing is, now I have a near 2 year old daughter and next summer I plan on going on a big trip with her. Thanks for motivating me!
Omg you guys. One of my very favorite videos yet (and not just because the AT is a dream of mine!) Can’t wait till next week 💚
Y’all  should do something with Bear Grylls.
Were the mosquitoes a problem?
THIRD ! Every time Kara .
You guys are still crazy , it’s from one extreme to the other. It’s like whiplash in a YouTube video. You do know bears come out at dusk to forage right ? They don’t like the dark either .
I heard NautiStyles drop your name on a recent video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x2aH9xTBV8
The jetboil has a pushbutton igniter. You don’t need a lighter for the flame. There’s a button on it.
I did this trail over two days.. fricken looove it!
I love the physical challenge videos! Some of those are my favorites by y'all. Keep doin em! But also this is cool too  🙃
Nate you need to take your papa on an adventure ❤
Be loud and youll be good 👍
Too many ads
That firetower has some of the best views 😍 backpacking on the AT is always a wonderful adventure!
When Nate said part of the trail must not be used often he was walking in stinging nettle😊
Y’all are in my back yard. ❤the smokies
I did _not_ have as pleasant of experience as you in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  We planned a day hike and chose near the SE corner to be away from the crowds.  I am from Oregon, so we _did_ expect there to be differences. First there was litter strewn all over the car parking area.  Not a bit of it here and there, but _mounds_ of it.  Either people brought heaps of household waste with them to dump or there had not been litter cleanup crews in a long time.  Not until we starting hiking did the volume of trash noticeably diminish.  The first occasion with no visible trash as probably an eighth of a mile up the trail.  There were many areas where people left wrappers, containers, and the like probably where they opened stuff while hiking and apparently made _no_ attempt to pack it out. Second, the trail climbed at a very consistent slope.  Expert grading really, but in the wild usually there are random variations which provide variety and psychological respite.  The mid-summer foliage was dense and somewhat dark. Third, there was human waste occasionally.  Not buried.  Not off the trail.  Some people apparently just drop their pants and let loose.  They left their used toilet paper to commemorate the occasion. Fourth, there were no breaks in the forest to view surrounding hills. Not even a rocky outcrop.  The only opportunity was at the top of the hill (the destination of the trail) where we *had* *to* *wait* in line to climb the rickety firewatch tower. Due to the non-appeal of my experience, I'm sure I have discouraged dozens of people from visiting the park!
You guys have fun with each other; in that action, your love shows.  I was in those same woods four weeks ago camping.
the nate physical challenge video are the best videos
Hello. The two of you are very powerful and get along very well.✨✨👍 Cheers with a tortilla.😊 The view of the sea of clouds in the mountains is also very nice.🤩🔔subscribed🎉✨
This is my back yard lol I live in Gatlinburg and hike these trails quite often
Peanut butter & chocolate chips in a tortilla = Rortilla's  (Reese Company will have to trademark this)  :)   Love your videos guys!
the great smoky mountains in pigeon forage  is by far one of the best places to camp & hike.  we go a few times a year.  it’s so beautiful.  We trail ride and camp with our horses
The “flizard” and singing “Rocky Top” are my favorite! Love this.
Going off the grid, while we constantly post our doings on mass media!
Not me pausing to run and make that peanut butter and chocolate wrap 😂😂
I hiked 16.4 miles of the AT 2 weeks ago, from Woody Gap to Tesnatee Gap and I had so much fun.
I love your videos so much you are the sweetest person I ever met I love you Both so much you do all these things for us 🥰🔮🏝😇😍😚🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
“Not connected..” recording the entire trip for content. Lol 😂🤷‍♂️
So I am trying to say power to you just wish I new how to get of the grid and leave the electronics somewhere far away;)
How can you be going of the grid  when you are using electronic devices? I too use my phone so it looks like you have the way
I would love camp there! Any details on where you hiked from and what trails you took to get to the fire tower?
So, a new series coming out?!
As someone who grew up in the Appalachian mountains, I have to say that we cringe so hard when someone pronounces it “App-a-laysha” we pronounce it “Apple-at-cha” it’s the only correct way🤷🏻‍♀️🤣
Smokey* Mountains
How is no one talking about Nate's afro back in the day.
Kara and Nate: We need a break  Narrator: Their whole life was a break
Love it!  More NC content!
These wilderness episodes are getting tedious. You’ve done quite a few of these already
Love seeing you guys back home in TN and in the Smokies.  “Rocky Top” was the highlight (apart from the sunrise of course 😀).  Will y’all be at the Tennessee-Alabama game?  You need to be the guest pickers for Gameday!  Go Vols!
love y’all so much 🥺
From lovely traveling couple back in the day to Covid vax possessed duo.
The more lowkey videos are my favorite! They are more relatable. Also, it stresses me out when you almost die in certain videos, haha
16:45 - I don't think there's anywhere on the East coast at 10,000 Ft of elevation, the tallest is Mount Mitchell in NC at 6684.
Holy smokes.  Just you filming in that tower made me nervous, for me!  Great video!
9:25 I think it was a bigfoot!
The suspense yall created with the edits only brings this experience more to life! Mid ways through the video lol
We were in the Smoky Mountains the same week as you guys(so random cuz we live in Hawaii, and this wasn't a spot on our list for a long time!) Sad we didn't bump into you two, but we did "bump" into more than 10 bears, so I guess it was just as enthralling, haha :D Love your videos!
I'm not scared of bears or boars.....I'm scared of axe murderers.
You two are so stinking cute!
I have to know where you got the little cooker for water and the coffee set up i need one when i go camping! lol
Blue ridge/ great smokies are my favorite places on earth!!! Especially this time of year it's beautiful there ❤️ so glad y'all got to experience it!
10,000 ft....check your altimeter!
First time watching any of your work. I have to say that this was one of the friendliest, just all around most enjoyable videos I have ever had the pleasure of viewing! And of course it was somewhat educational as well - thanks! I feel the LOVE!!!
I so hope at some point you get to Maui HI. If you do, do the sunrise atop Haliakala, best sunrise on earth.
OMG, I’m so jealous!!! This is exactly what I want to do badly with my husband or my sons! I’ve been doing so much research because I’ve never hiked (well backpacked) before but this Mama Bear is CRAVING a good ole hike in the woods! Ya’ll are the BEST.. STAY AMAZING ❤❤❤
If you want a lightweight and spacious 2 person check out the Gossamer Gear The Two. It’s a great price for an ultralight tent that’s very spacious and comfy. We enjoy it on all our AT hikes :)
it’s crazy that you guys are seriously 20 minutes from where i live
i like the physical challenge videos too!
OMG I hope you LOVED the Appalachians. Those beautiful mountains are y home and I am so proud of it! Little fun fact since you saw some salamanders, The southern Appalachians are known as the salamander capital of the world! I am glad the mountains were kind to you. With love from AL <3
I thought bears know how to climb trees .......
I honestly love Nate’s challenges it’s so fun to watch love you guys
“Off the grid” proceeds to make the most on the grid move by uploading a YouTube video…
No way!! I’m in the Smokey’s!!
It’s cause pigs and hogs don’t have sweat glands so it’s how they cook down
Normal Life !!!!!! Do you guys have any idea what a normal life is??? Lol
So if this blesses u2 with a baby, how about a birthing @ the Farm in Tennessee??? #SpiritualMidwifery!!!
Your channel has become so much commercial for us buying shitty products. I don't like it at all.
You two make everything look like fun ❤️
Love how someone wrote g dragon's name by the shelter bed. Representation 😭🤟
I LOVE Nate's physical challenges videos! :)
💩
Another commercial in another 'boyfriend will go nuts and kill me van'.  What a bore.  I would much rather sit in comfort in my nice house and do anything else.
I was literally in the Smokies at the end of September and I kept thinking how y’all should do videos there 😂 there were a TON of vans up there!
I love ❤️ 😍 your videos my name ia Austin
if the boars run to you and they have kids its best to climb an tree or when they are running into just like move out the way because when then run they run like tanks and the can kill you
I guess it's time to consider an AT thru-hike. No?
I stayed in these shelters during my thru hike in 2019 and woke up to mice pulling out my hair.
tnx for metric system conversion!!
I personally love when you guys do physical challenges! I love all of your videos!!!
I love your “Greatful Reset!”
Love you both but, nope!
Number one thing I would need is bug spray
This is exactly what my brother does every month!
I thought salamanders were cute too until one tried to steal my dads sunglasses so watch out
Chana Masala HAHAHAHA Weirdly feels cool to see you guys eat something I know HEHEHEHE
Hanımcılıkta bu abi gibi olmalıyız arkadaşlar. Adam her sabah kıza kahve yapıyor. Çok temiz.
Get some bear bells!! It's better to warn wild animals you are coming than to “sneak” up on them and have them turn on you. 😳
Wild boars will chase you for about a minute or so.. If you can climb a tree that's your best bet. I live in FL and see them ALL the time. Even as a kid, I've learned how to get away from them. Love the video!!
I appreciate the translation from pounds to kilos so much! pounds tell me absolutely nothing :P
if you really want a break, you need to stop doing 'things' like hiking. just set up a camp in a single spot for a few days, sit around a campfire and roast marshmallows and hotdogs and stare at the sky.
I have been along through 100 countries...thank you for dragging me with you.
Pee check...
Instagraaaaaam! 😀
App-uh-latch-un
I love u guys 🥰🥰🥰🤗😛🤗🤗🤗
Awesome trip 🤘👍💪❤❤❤
I started your playlist from the beginning and I'm finally caught up🎉
For what its worth I like Nate's challenge videos
Being in the woods, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life. I love how you’re well rounded in your travels, it’s refreshing
Hi, Kara and Nate!  This was quite an adventure… I’m looking forward to watching part 2😊
I need a off the grid moment---
After binge watching your whole 1 year of travel vlogs and recent stuff, i finally ordered AG1 HAHAHAH
Loved this vlog. The Great Smokey Mts are beautiful and one of my favorite places. Of course I like watching all of your adventures.  Looking forward to part 2.
Ok the b roll?  Seriously?  The amount of extra effort you put into this video and let’s be honest every video, is incredible. Your talent is not unappreciated or unnoticed.  Great job!
I love everything you guys do, I’m here for you guys, the energy the vybes and the chemistry. Plus I love nature so. 😂
What you meant to say was..."Kara will act as your BEARrier while you sleep" lol
Just wanted pop on here and say I love seeing you both flash back pics. Nate’s crown has to be the highlight. #bringthecurlsback
I love the Nate physical challenge videos! Keep it up!
The wild boar part - Cara:"You go first?" Nate:"Me????" 🤣🤣🤣
Just a question, where is part 2 ???????
We have wild boars where I am and they are very dangerous and aggressive asf 😭
I loved the way this video ended😊
I know you made the right decision NOT to hike the trail when you were in college. I believe that your relationship with Kara would have survived because of the bond you have now. But losing the college scholarship would have been a disaster. Your degree opens so many doors that should not remain closed just because you don't have that piece of sheepskin to go along with your knowledge. The trail you are doing for this video is beautiful and far away from everyone. Talk about being off-grid...
Glad to see you got yourself a water filter. Love it 1. get my knife  2. this will be the last line of defence and 3. Bear spray will be first line, 4. you wanna go first, 5. high pitched ME? from nate classic. oh yeah and 6. great way to build drama insert favour scary music here.
How about coming to India and moving around in the van
This doesn't seem overly relaxing 😀
The end of this video is the genuine tiredness kicking in, and I love it. Lol. 😂
in Sweden we say if you run into a wild boar, don't get out of the car, they may very well attack you
Love love love your channel💖
Awesome video
I only know about wild boar being dangerous from Old Yellar!
“Hey bear?” It would have been SO classic if you yelled “Hey Boo Boo”! 🤣🤣🤣 You missed that great opportunity!!! 😂😂😂
This video was posted, so obviously you weren’t eaten by a bear…good for you. The sights, trees and foliage are beautiful, only something you get when you’re in a forest. Thanks for sharing!
We were eating ham and cheese sandwiches in those mountains when I was a kid. A big old bear and her two cubs came by and wanted some. My dad had us all run to our wood grained station wagon and watch the bears as they ate everything he couldn’t gather quickly enough. Best memory ever! The momma bear even picked up our Coleman water jug and drank out of it until all the water was gone, then she easily tossed it about 20 feet. 🤣🤣🤣 It was 1987 or 1998, but it’s one of my first and favorite memories!!!
G-Dragon and T.O.P got me HAHAHAHA
Really get the luxury after camping thing, the light switch, hot running water bliss, in balance.
Getting Deliverance vibes from this video, must be the pigs…
I have been watching your videos a long time now, how do I start from your 1st blog or video?
Love you guys I can’t wait to see the rest of your trip, And I think it was an amazing idea spending some time away from the social media to just spend time out doors like more humans should do😂 Love you guys ❤❤❤❤
Wow I think that was a Sasquatch! Very scary and worrisome but you two are protected!!
Come to Townsend, TN! I’m right next to yall
When did I ask
what is the name of the portable  water heater and the water filter bottle
You should hike Mount Thielsen together.
Nice and "Local" for you.  Although "Local" is now almost anywhere for you both.  Ha.  Glad you're in the Great Smoky Mountains.  I love that park though only have been there three times and that is when we still lived in the Eastern USA (TN and FL).
You're so lovely 😍 and funny x x
Very cool
Love this vídeo 😍❤️💪
You guys should come to kaui
reminds me of firewatch
My brother just finished the Appalachian trail almost a month ago.
Dude I love the challenge videos! Don't listen to the haters! I am overweight and your bike video has inspired me to lose weight. So far I have lost 5 lbs. Thanks guys for the content! If you are ever in Oklahoma I have a electric hookup with your name on it!
could you guys link all the gear you guys brought? i would to see a video that's the aftermath of the trip  where you guys rate all the gear you brought!
Loved this video! A part of me misses watching Kara try new foods in foreign places while Nate tries to figure out travel plans last minute lol but I love all your content. I’ve gone back and rewatched the 100 countries series a few times now. Just do what makes you happy 😊 ❤
You guys brought up two important points about backpacking: 1) it makes you grateful for garbage pickup, flushable toilets, showers, and water faucets; and 2) it is nice to work for your scenery -- a hard hike usually brings great rewards (beauty, solitutude, etc).  I loved this video!  It's nice when you guys get back to the basics and just simply exist.
I hiked down the snake den trail into Cosby Campground I'm 2018
Nate's physical challenge videos are everything. Fight me. Pro-tip: That's a physical challenge as well.
It’s so fun watching you all go to places my husband and I took our teenage children to.  Hiking the smokies, the boundary waters, white water rafting in Colorado.  Wishing video cameras were what they are today so we could have filmed them.  Now we are taking our grandchildren to places! Just can’t do the 30 mile hikes anymore! Love you two living life!
Omg are you guys gonna do the Appalachian trail?
Seeing a sunrise from a mountain top is absolutely amazing! I’m glad I’ve had the chance myself.
Nate always has a way to get kara some coffee
Pro Tip: Add water before starting the jetboil to prevent the pot from warping over time.
Thank u for sharing this AMAZING hike with us💚 I absolutely lice vicariously thru u two lol! My fave was the sunrise 🌅 in the fire tower 😍 omg🥰 SO GEORGOUS 🥰🤩🥰🤩🥰😍😍😍😍. I just adore u both & your adventures are awesome 😊😊
I love in knoxville and go to the smokies several tines a year. There is a other youtuber that you will run into eventually called hiking with braids who is also awesome
So fun fact, the hike to rocky top is one of my favorite spring hikes. But one year I went up there and boar had completely decimated the plants other than trees. The slopes of rockytop didn't have flowers or grass along the trails. It was as if someone took am excavator up there. It was really very sad.
Keep these videos coming👍💪🙏
I love the Smoky Mountains, especially in fall, I need to take a roadtrip soon.
You were being followed by a bigfoot!
Great Smoky Mountains ... my favorite area in all of the US. Lived in Knoxville for 10 years. Spent every minute I could hiking and driving all through it. It's a glorious place to be. And there are bears.
As always, great filming and editing.  I love your channel.
Awesome content! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
I’d rather go in a hole than use that toilet 🤢
You just need to stick with the van vlogs or the cruises
FYI Sunsets are lame compared to  Sunrises. Not nearly enough of sunrise videos time lapse 😔
Jesus loves you
The AT is my fave trail on the planet. It's magic.  Enjoy!  Next time try the section called the 100 acre wood.  Amazing. As to your doing the whole thing...the trail will always be there calling to you.
Love hiking in The Great Smokey Mountains! Glad you two made the time for yourselves to relax and enjoy!
I get bored with camping after 3 hours, there's no chance I could live off the grid. 🤣
Gorgeous part of the USA. This is even better view than the fire tower outside of Asheville you did one morning.
That kiss looked like someone isn’t on the same team.
So amazing
Btw they make PB in squeeze tube packaging now…backpackers dream!
I was cracking up at the ending in the tent 😂😂😂
It feels so good to see you guys back in TN! Also, I have SO MUCH RESPECT for people that complete the 2,000 miles of the Appalachian Trail! I cannot imagine hiking for 6 months of your life, and it's crazy that some hikers do that every single year...I love watching YouTubers who post Appalachian Trail videos! Anyway, love from a TN girl (in college in STL right now :)) who has been watching you guys for years and subscribed when you guys had less than 1 million subscribers!!! You guys make me want to continue traveling so bad (I reference you guys all of the time), hopefully I can study abroad next summer🤞💙
Did I miss the solar boat?
I love the AT. When my husband and I retire we are hiking the whole thing.
I've hiked the trail to the fire lookout a couple of times.  That is a difficult hike. My closest brush with wildlife was stepping over a timber rattle snake thinking it was a big root. But then it wasn't.
Just a helpful tip u guys should get a better water filter. There are a lot of water filters that are much lighter than your water bottle and filter faster
Just watch Game of Thrones and you’ll understand how dangerous wild boars are
What if the noise was Bigfoot???
can kids drink ag1
I use a snow ski pole as a hiking stick.  Good hiking help and weapon......I don't want a bear getting me.  LOL.
If y'all enjoy magical sunrises and sunsets, you would love this family-owned dude ranch in Antinito, Colorado! Y'all should totally try it! Its called Rainbow Trout Ranch and I go with my family. You should email me if you are interested!!!
I literally just had instant potatoes for dinner tonight, like a half hour ago! My puppy loves them too! :)
omg I love you guys!! These are my favorite vlogs!!
Hope you guys had a lovely time together!
Im a 53 year old woman from Toronto. I stumbled across your videos and so happy I did.... You both are pure joy, love and goodness.  Every week is like waiting for your favourite show - but better!  So happy you both exist and share your incredible journey.
@27:33 Nice edit! :D
So on point about appreciating the everyday of life
Unfortunately AG1 tastes like s*#!t sorry to ruin your dreams I tried so hard to like it and I just couldn’t
You know why i love you guys? The fact you where able to move from a 5 stars cruise on the Arctic to a rugged real backpacking!
I love the full size BBQ lighter…….lol
I have the same exact sleeping pad as Kara
Was 12 moving from Charleston SC to Idaho. Family “tent” camping but I was only one sleeping in tent. Rolled over i middle of night felt something warm and hairy, started screaming. Parent came from camper just to find i was touching our basset hound. My dad always says to me remember your bear. I am 60 now lol. Beautiful place.
You guys should be making noise while hiking to warn the animals that you are there
We’re are you’re children?
I was feeling freaked out by the height just watching you on that fire tower!
Y'all made my legs wobbly going up that fire tower. Awesome views though. I'm just on the other side of the border in NC. So lucky to live surrounded by so much natural beauty.
Love it and Love yall!!! Hiking with your best friend 🥰
I like your self development videos. You challenge yourself if I ever have said otherwise it’s because I’m jealous of you guys for doing the things I cannot or dare not to do.
Great vlog guys can’t wait for part 2. That view was amazing!!
there so brave going there with all the animals 🥴 I could never
It’s so great eating squirrels 🐿 together 😂😂😂😂😂😂
That tent is bigger than my tent
My grandfather (now 85) hiked the App. Trail in 2001!
When y’all started talking about the shelter I knew what you were about to say 😂 “rats” the Appalachian trail is an amazing place! Y’all are so wonderful and the best YouTubers out there!!
Pigs don’t sweat so they have to go in the mud to cool down.
You bag hanging video from the boundary waters is maybe the funniest moment you guys have ever posted. So good.
Yes wild hogs are dangerous they destroyed my husband tent. They had to climb a tress they kept chasing him and his friend
Been a long wait from your last video your my happy pill guys so happy to see a new one ❤
Last year I read a book called,  A walk in the woods by Bill Bryson, about a trip along the Appalachian Trail. If you are into reading books this was funny and serious at the same time, you might enjoy it. If you prefer the movie, lol, go for it. Glad you are doing this, do you have walking sticks? They are good for helping you through mud, up and down hills, and fending off wild boar or any other creature you find along the trail.
Not another one of of nate physical challenge videos
I have a challenge for you guys.  Can you make it thru a whole video without saying "can't get better than this"?  I don't think it is possible.
Not another one in each physical challenge
Not another Nate challenge video
Not another one of Nate's Physical challenge videos
not gonna lie but the amount of peanut butter on those wraps is about a month worth quantity for me.... 😅
I would have to carry a 357/44mag/12guage
Loved it. Hiking in the woods is so cool.😎👍😊
Stoked to watch this one
Kara and Nate is my comfort chanel🥰💓
Hey Kara and Nate! Heads up, if you ever encounter wild hogs, and they truly are determined to harm you, try to find higher ground like climbing a tree, you are more likely to stay safe when your out of reach of the hog:) (coming from experience)
What would you need to do when you are sleeping and a bear or a wild boar is by your tent? Never been hiking and we don't have bears here in Belgium either...
I live in Gallatin TN and your videos inspire me.  I loved seeing the Smokey mountains.
PSST the cameras mic is inverted left is right and right is left :) @ 28:25
your videos are so well composed. Every time i see a side shot of you guys walking i'm imagining you going into the brush and setting up the shot. thanks for doing that for us :)
The funniest (or maybe sad?) thing about the shelter is that on the bunk bed, there's a K-Pop fan that came by and etched TOP and G-Dragon on the wood.
Yall are so darn cute! Love the hikes can't wait to get back up there sometime!
Wait I’m confused, I thought Rick and Bec’s kids were much younger, meaning that if they were born in 2001 it would mean they were in the 20s????
You guys should do Chattajack next year! It's a 32 mile paddle race that starts in Chattanooga Tennessee. It may not be the most intense "physical challenge" that you guys have done, but it's a lot of fun! Sign up is May 1rst at midnight, but the race is at the end of October.   If you want more details, let me know! I did it last year on a tandem surfski and this year I'll be doing solo female kayak
Love the Smokies!  My favorite place to visit! Can’t wait to see the rest of your trip.
Nate you need to go back to the buzz cut! Not to many guys can pull off a buzz cut but you for sure can!!
May I ask what is the brand of the water bottle purifier?
And you're supposed to make nose if you hear something to scare off the bears. Please be careful and read up on bears.
Why don't you have bear spray? Go buy some please. Both of you should have it on you at all times.
I loved this! About six months ago I stumbled upon a used copy of Bill Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods" book. I read it and then looked for more info on hiking the AT. I found many youtube videos about the trek. As soon as I saw that you were going to sleep in the shelter, I thought, Oh no! Mice! Glad to see you only stayed in the one shelter, cause those shelters don't look comfortable at all. I'm looking forward to part 2!
Not going to lie  I thought you  met you guys where taking a break from youtube.
Thus video made me so calm!! Omg loved it ❤️
I am from Tennessee too and I love the Smoky mountains. Your video of the sunrise was incredible. I'm looking forward to part two!
Awe I wished you guys stayed in Canada.  There are SO much beautiful hiking trails especially Alberta bad lands in Brooks and chasing waterfalls in B.C like in Tumbler Ridge
So happy to see y'all hiking in the Smokies. Too many people just drive through and miss all the park has to offer
What's the name of your water filter?
"It's like a lizard with fish scales. A flizard." 🤣🤣🤣
I was just going through your channel and holy bajesus how have you guys created so much content?! this is insane!
nice video! i would be more scared of a bear haha they are HUGE, strong and can run/climb very fast! I would not feel safe with that little knife 😂
I've been watching you guys for a while  pretty much accomplish all the challenges I challenge you to walk the Appalachian trail now that will be a trophy 🏆🥇accomplishment  can you handle that challenge ???
You all should hock up with outdoor boys youtube channel to do a nature challenge
Very entertaining video
You guys are just to Cute!
Comment
How fun! I like the convenience of the dehydrated meals when I backpack. I haven’t tried the ones you guys are eating. Can you rate the one’s you’ve tried?
i’m only calling a salamander a “flizard” from now on 😂
You guys are so precious and such a joy to watch 😂💜
i loved your laugh at the end😂
Love your happiness and adventure
Why a salamander wasn’t originally named a Flizard is beyond me
Northeast Tennessee > Middle Tennessee 😉
This is how my parents explain to me how they got to school back in the day 😂
I Love Nature and Kara
love y’alls backpacking content!! gimme more!!
I love that u guys always include the kilo's (kg's) or the kilometers (km's)!
29:56 funniest thing ever.
just going to throw this out there. While the different shots you get are awesome and we enjoy each and every one of them  hiking ahead to set up the shot to hike back down to then hike back up for said shot to then have to in some cases hike back again to retrieve the equipment is insanity especially when you say things like this is supposed to be relaxing. Not going to even go into the possibility retakes  ☠. Keep enjoying life but try not to kill yourselves in the process ok 😉and if your going to make a video about relaxing try actually relaxing, none of us will think less of you and if anyone in the comments does we  will bring full holy wrath upon them!
Silly... when you get sick of the rain, insects and bad food, let us know.  Good luck.
Omg Nate with all the hair😂 I haven’t watched the whole video but I’m hooked
Love Kara’s description of how gratefulness can be reset by doing without with intent.
06:19 G-DRAGON?? T.O.P?? The V.I.Ps be doing the most!! I love it!!
Your expressions are priceless!  What a fun video!
That’s called a Sea of Clouds.
I love this. OH that sunrise. Gods creation. How fun. Thank you for sharing.
I love the physical challenge videos! I love all of your videos btw :)
I thought that was your van I saw in the Smokey Mtns when we were there in September. I saw this van while walking back to our car that looked really familiar. It even had a Baja Mexico sticker in the window and I thought...This looks a lot like the van Nate and Kara used in Mexico, but it was a Ram van. I wish I would have run into you two.
Kara and Nate! Every time you guys post a video it makes my day no matter what the video is about. I can’t express my love for you two your channel. I really really really love you guys and don’t you two dare to quit YouTube for the coming 20-30 years. You two make my life❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh can you post the next one sooner.. please.. 😆😆
Wonderful trip thru gorgeous nature💚💚💚💚💚
black bears are harmless gotta watch out for wolves and mountain lions
Thanks Nate, even with a full backpack you weigh less than I do.  I will be at the gym tonight.
Nate: "Hey bear!!!"  Bear: "Hey Nate!"
so dreamy
We need a Nate hitting his head on things montage
I was actually on one of the mountains in your view from the fire tower. I'm guessing y'all were there in September. We were there for Rod Run. As a fellow Tennessean the smokies are our second home.  Y'all are cracking me up about the bears the boars were definitely the more dangerous of the two. I wish I could post our bear pics from our trip. I would say I wish y'all did more Tennessee videos but as beautiful as our state is I kinda want to keep the best spots secret if you know you know. ❤️ 🌄
my dad just went backpacking and carried 50 pounds. idk how he did but he did like 30 miles and had elevation
Gahhhh, I want to get back on that trail so badly! Thanks for sharing the sunrise with me.
Condolences Nate on your grandmother's passing.  May I make a suggestion?  Can we see more of your grandfather in new upcoming episodes.  He's got a part of him missing, the best part, and he could use your work as a way to memorialize his love, as you can help him in his grief.  Many of your viewers are older.  They will appreciate what he is going through and what you are trying to do, which might make a good book.  Start a caravan and bring him along:  A Karavan's Wake by i need a break nate
This looks like so much fun. Love the stuffing and mash potatoes dinner.yum!
Amazing green adventure! Wonderful forest🌲🌲🌲 great work walking and peaceful shooting! I enjoy your superb peaceful video by heart💕💕 I much greet you by heart💕💕💕always big wishes to you!
I HATE that feeling of walking through the woods after seeing a dangerous animal 😩We live in Montana and still have that feeling!
Great episode! Enjoying your amazing videos from Japan. Cheers!!
Such a great video. Camping definitely makes it easier to live in a sense of gratitude.
No I love these types of kinda like survival hiking videos
I just loved this episode:)
Me and my fiance have had peanut butter with chocolate chips on a flour tortilla and it was pretty good.
Wow, this was incredible. This is why I watch your videos! I’m disabled and will probably never hike again. Being able to see these views (not thru a picture) is amazing. Last time I hiked was in 2019. Thanks for all the great videos! definitely living through you guys ❤
Your feet stink has to be a regular update
Need the views not a break, anything to be liked
would love to do this!!!🤍🤍
Have you ever thought though that maybe all those comments complaining about the sheer amount of surviving in the woods-videos might have a point? I enjoy the odd one every few months, but almost every other video being a survival-woods-type vlog is not what most people subscribed to the channel for, it gets a bit boring after a while
Where is your first camp site? Also, how many miles into is tht in the forest?
Do the Camino in Spain
Get some tyvek house wrap and make it into a ground tarp. It's light weight and works great
I really love how you guys truly appreciate every little thing you get to do. Like there’s always a “wow” from Kara or a cinematic shot from Nate. You two are amazing. I love your adventures
So, don’t freak out, but that big thing you heard in the woods was likely a mountain lion… they only make themselves known to hikers when they want to, and they are known to follow you 😅
Go off grid in Alaska-be tough
I've hiked Camerer twice. It's a very hard hike. I saw the Low Gap Trail sign and knew exactly what was going on.
Havent seen the video yet at all, but (thumbnail (ie simple life in the woods)) sounds more like, difficult life in the woods (lol). How is a life is woods simpler than living in a normal home in some normal city (with convenience of roads, cars (to travel), supermarkets, lets say even nice neighborhood communities with whom you can mix and hang out and interact with)). A normal life in a (normal (ie normal city ie states like say california or any state in general and not like super expensive and busy and fck and cant use cars and all (and have to do lot of hecting travelling and all through the trains and all) crowded cities, like new york. But I think even that is easier than living in woods (I guess).)) city is far more easier and convinient than in woods. (Also woods ie a house in woods would probably face power ie electricity difficulty problems too for your house with either no electricity or huge time to fix power supply if faced by any problem in it, and will have no nearby hospitals and all too.     ('(^Maybe^ (like I havent done a survey lol (hence the 'maybe'.))) ^A lot of^ ') People really underestimate the beauty in living a convenient and normal life and think the cliche 'path breaking' and 'different' lives shown in movies and all about like say this woods one or living a traveler life ie just travelling all the countries all the time instead of "(Edit:) " ' 'living/(/ie) staying' in a place' ie" " having a fixed home somewhere where they stay for '(a)/a' lot ie majority of the time in a year, is the best life ((ie//) way of living) and all.)
I'd be willing to bet a dollar that you brought your phone. That's not off grid. Also videoing it is not off grid.
Around 11:42 you guys had beautiful music with the sounds of flowing water… can you make a video of just that? I struggle with anxiety every morning and that was like nothing I’ve ever heard before it calmed me right down. I love you both so much and thank you for another amazing video❤
Love that you guys are trending right now 💗 Y’all live my dream life, love your videos (& you guys) SO SO much.
Why do I keep getting videos of these tosser couples who actually think we want to watch snippets from their stupid little lives. We don't - GO AWAY!!!
Thanks so much for the video guys. You have no idea how much this cheered me up. I had an awful night in one of mine anxiety/depression spirals, was still in tears this morning trying to go about the day. This video was so light and calming, you actually made me laugh and smile! You guys are the best.   It was nice to know about your period of long distance relationtip, I thought you had a perfect untouched love story hahaha. Long distance is so difficult, glad to know you guys made it and are so happy now. You two remind me so much of the love of my life. Life's separeted us, and I miss him very much, it still breaks my heart everyday. Your dinamic and energy remind me a lot of him, but somehow It's not triggering at all, on the contrary, it makes me so happy. Your love is beautiful, its lovely to see, and its very clear you know how lucky you both are to have each other. Congratulations!! Wish you all the best ❤️
Lets hope that you don't end up on a Mrballen video😅
i'm not an outdoor-ze person by any stretch of the imagination (like looking at it or going for easy paved walks) but I did go camping a few times in Girl Guides. My first time was for a week in a tent with an outhouse containing three open holes. One of our chores was to scrub it with bleach -  which makes me think of that anytime I smell Clorox - and my day home I make a beeline to the bathroom and flushed the toilet LOL.
We need a break. No not from narcissism, we will continue to post
Been wanting you to do some hiking in the Smokies and the AT!  I love backpacking myself.  You know why there are mice in all the shelters?  Because people cook and eat in them.  Not suppose to do that or cook and eat near where you sleep in your tent.  It attracts the bears you know.  I am so glad Nate took that lip chap from you and went to the trouble of taking down your backpack to store it for the night.  Fun video!
I love the video❤
Would you guys ever consider hiking the whole Appalachian Trail? Love your vids! Thank your for continuing to create.
:-)
I love the "X" on the coffee mug. Did you pick that up at an REI sale? Waste not, want not.
Kara & Nate I have a question for you: What are y'all's favorite hiking/camping meals when you don't have a source of power?
You should always carry a pistol hiking in a remote location. Just some old man's advice😉😉
I was just thinking.. I would rather be first, cause then the person in back can both take a surprise attack from behind and keep an eye out for the person in front.
14:08 that’s why his hair is so big….it’s full of secretssss 😂
I felt the same when I went camping. You really learn to appreciate the good things we have in life!
Wow! From a fellow Tennessean, loved this.
I had a friend hike the Appalachian trail back in the spring coolest ever!!! Cant wait for the video from Knoxville! Wish I could have met y’all! GBO 🧡
So funny that last part. 😂 “Try to not inhale right before your going to kiss me.”  I liked this adventure through the woods. Would like to do it one day.
On my channel I can’t imagine having nearly a half million views within a day after posting.  There’s so many haters in the world… you guys don’t lose sight of how awesome you are and how far this channel has come. You’ve overcome so much and conquered.  From a fellow Southerner over here in Arkansas, I just wanted y’all to know that I’m watching and I’m super proud of you both.  If you ever need anything just holler. ♥️JaDeL
My ppl❤
No trekking poles? Big mistake
Knife??? your in a heavily populated area with bears and you dont have bear spray??? Love the vids but be safe guys its like $30 at any Cabellas
Do you think you'd ever do the AT from start to finish?
If I am not mistaken Jetboils have an igniter button; at least mine does. No need to carry the lighter.
You all are truly great and I hope I get the pleasure of meeting you one day. So funny and nice and grateful. And Kara I don’t know why Nate wanted to be a psychopath and mix the potato’s and stuffing 😂😂😂
Nothing on the east coast of the US is even close to 10k ft elevation. Highest peak in smokey mountain np clingmans dome around 6,600 ft.
We are about to embark on a month long cycle ride, as a couple, and this resonates so much. We are looking forward to sharing some intentional time together and also re-adjusting our gratitude bar ❤  Also thank you for introducing me to peanut butter choc chip wraps. I have a feeling they’re going to be an essential part of our ride menu 😂
„We need a break“ *proceed to go in dangerous woods* no jk nice video
Many of our friends are hikers, which is a common activity in NH, but I’m from Long Island (we don’t hike and we don’t have bears), and I quickly discovered that me and the woods don’t miss. 😂 Good for you guys making it for five days…I would have died of fright five times over. 😂
Nate eating peanut butter out of the jar over your back 😂 I love watching you guys. Yeah we found out my wife was pregnant once we got back from a trail in red river gorge KY. We were wondering why she was so tired and it was so difficult. Ha. Y’all are hiking in my kinda woods. Love it
That old fire tower is really rotting away
You guys really need to come to the UK and do the coast to coast trail! You’d love it.
How about Nate thru hiking the AT with Kara providing support in the van? Best of both worlds!
Love this video!
A bit off topic, but let me just say that we have wild boars roaming the streets of Hong Kong.  We have many living on Hong Kong Island itself.  They're pretty large creatures.  We all co-exist, more or less.
I love the challenge videos! My favorite series of all was the colorado bike trip.
Funny Nate, there’s no 10K mountain ranges in the East Coast. The highest is just over 6K feet elevation.
Okay kiddos, I’ve been waiting for the day that you two awesome people were going to hike the AT!  Nate is proof positive that you should, you clearly have wonderful Kara and you’ve finished college.  Kara is so devoted and adventurous that after some convincing and promises of an endless supply of coffee I just bet she would do it . Just think about 5 or 6 months of content not to mention the hundreds of sponsors!  I’m 67 and would have no qualms about doing it myself except that I have an 87 year old mother whom I happy to care for.  I absolutely adore you guys 😊
Fun video!  You both look like you always have fun no matter what you are doing.  Watched a lot of AT thru hikers and many of them use Tyvek as their ground cloth since it is so light weight and durable.  So many comments so not sure if anyone has mentioned that.  Anyway definitely do more of these videos…really enjoyed it!
Brilliant ypu both just bring so much joy & Laughter   Kara i would Freek out at mice or bugs running over me 😮 . But i love Hikes. In the Nature ( not keen at all on camping )  Can fully understand what you were saying Kara.  Wise words We do take so much for Granted how ever  big or small it is . So Great  you and Nate taking this sort of travel for your selfs together ❤( you both do so much for us the viewer, hours you put in etc. Yes i know its your work🤔 but still you both have to look after your selfs physical & Mental health too ) 🥰  Looking forward to your next video  have a Good week 🥰🥰
Pro-tip... you should be LOUD going through the woods, *not* quiet.  Hushing your voices when you hear something is the opposite of what you want to do.  Start singing, yelling, whatever.  The idea is that 1. you might scare off whatever it is, and 2. you NEVER want to sneak up on a large animal (especially a bear).
You hang some food on a tree branch, but you're still the food 🙂
mental image: Kara hugging bearcups while Nate behind her back is wrestling mamabear hahaha
Awesome and beautiful adventure..... but I would be always scared 😨 of getting Poison Ivy
Hope you brought bear spray too, you know…for the bears.
Oh man I love you guys
The Appalachians are definitely haunted, so it might not be a bear.
And yet you're filming it. Kinda misses the point of spending real quality time with your wife or husband. This is a beautiful video, however. 26:50 give glory to God! Be grateful to HIM who provides all things. Hallelujah!!
Smoky Mountains.. such a magical place🤍🤍🤍🤍 my fav vacation spot!!!
Love Nate with the curly hair of yesterday !!!!!!!!!
Warning to anyone who has seizers or headaches when seeing flashing lights small flashing at 29.55 and ends at 29.58.
Come to Katahdin Appalachian trail i'm right near it and would love to meet yall
When are you ever coming to Hawaii! You claimed in your previous videos that you plan to visit all 50 states in your van. If you ever come to hawaii then come to oahu and we can meet up and i can give you a free tour!
You ever thought about doing the Appalachian Trail in the future? Sending many alohas your way!
I love that you combine good cinematography with taking the time to really get a sense of place and what each day is like. it's so immersive! it's great!
i love how even on a trip like this, nate is still on coffee duty. love the content as usual.
This camera has been through a lot! 😅😂😂 Amazing video once again!
I’ve never seen anybody use a jetboil like that. Fill with water, attach to burner, light…. Not the other way round!  Much less chance of burn/spill/scald!    Great video though, the fire tower was magical.
You just came back from a 12 day cruise in the Antarctic and you need a break? You guys must truly know suffering.
Great vid per usual. Reminds me of when I go camping every year at Sardine Lakes in the Tahoe forest area. Our campsite is on top of the PCT trail and when we drive the mile to the store for ice and food we always pick up PCT hikers trying ti go to the same store. This year we picked up this couple that reminded me so much of you Kara and Nate! They were from Germany and the one mile drive with them to the store was so epic. Such wonderful people it was so sick
Thank you guys so much I needed you guys tonight, it's been a rough one lately and your love helps my heart ❤️
“It’s like a lizzard that has fish scales, a flizzard” Hahaha I love you so much Kara
Very nice philosophy from Kara !
yall ever research how water is purified in the first place
Ha ha AG1 is made in NZ but we can not buy it here.
Thank you, Kara for explaining your thought process. In the beginning of video I really was like : "Seems that Kara really enjoys this. How did this happened and when :D "
We love the Challanges and Hope you will bring more in Future. Love You Guys.
I miss Kara's editing. You can tell they hired someone else, and Kara was more talented and had better taste in music. HOWEVER I'm glad Kara is figuring out how to have the best life for her.
And I was just thinking y’all should post like 2 times a week just I love y’all videos so much lmfao
Can you guys do a series or video where you investigate Bigfoot?? Survivor man did it and it was WILD CONTENT!
You could have put the tent on the bunk
That fire 🔥 tower footage gave me crazy anxiety. I could never.
I don't know why but when Kara said Flizard I laughed way harder than I should have😅
Kara is so funny 🤣 fish salemander
Wow, what a timely video, I’ve been watching and reading stories from the AT and PCT. Clearly you are enjoying your short hike!
I was recently rewatching your biking CT when I decided I wanted to see what it looked like from a hikers view and ive been following some peoples thru hikes on the AT.  I was thinking I would love to see You 2 do something like that its like you read my mind lol
I dove the challenge vids
I’m not a backpacker at all but you guys are making me want to be! Haha So how did you get such smooth shots? I can’t imagine you’d carry around a gimbal as it would be so much extra weight. Love your vids - you guys are so much fun!
Love it you two are so cute xx
Nate always does the physical challenges. Kara should try to go a week without coffe. 😂
Sleeping in the tent with Kara’s stinky feet😅
❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉absolutely loved this video you guys❤😂❤😂❤😂I know they are hard but it looked enjoyable and getting to enjoy it with family what could be better🌻🌞🌜🌙🌸🌱🪵🍁🌿just never 2 nd guess yourself. Always leave with fresh supplies. ie:fresh propane😮😊I hope you guys do this again sometime love to you all take care ❤❤❤❤Have a total blast❤🎉❤🎉
That G Dragon at the back. Makes me wanna go there just to put the rest of the   Bigbang members lol
I love tramping/hiking but i wouldnt be able to enjoy it with the fear of a bear following me. Im so glad I live in New Zealand lol
Love watching you guys and backpacking videos!
Now this is maybe too soon, but I don't think I'd be comfortable going to sleep around Cosby's Knob.
Kara and Nate PLEASE PART 2
So much fun lol
I found this video to b your most stressful video i have watched of yours.  I was worried for u.
Can’t stop watching you two , it’s my go to for good vibes Love you two ❤ Keep going , don’t stop … love the positive energy
Maaan I just love the love haha
WOW!!! What a sunrise!  Such a beautiful place!!!!!!
Love these back packing videos. Love all your videos but especially the back packing. When the hog scene came up, I was screaming inside “y’all better be looking for a tree to climb!” 😂 They are mean!
Should probably bring a dog with you guys next time😂😂😂woof woof... but this video is such a therapy to me.. THANK YOU KARA AND NATE❤️
Your reactions to the wild boars were like how we reacted when we saw the javelinas here the other day! Totally different animals, but both dangerous.   When you guys went to the top of the very unsteady structure, it reminded me of a castle in Colorado. It’s Bishop’s Castle, located in Rye. I’m sure you guys would love it, if you haven’t been before!
Where are you in this video??
Must have been safety glass.  They knew you were visiting i guess.  This may have been the best sunset dinner you've had so far, but it's also far from the last one - and there will be so many 'best dinners' for you two - that's my hope anyway.
The last 10 seconds of this video made me super happy smile. I love your love for each other!
I been watching y'all for a year now and honestly love all ur videos even some that I didn't think I liked I do because it y'all making the content I'm like how can just being in the woods be that interesting or fun to watch but y'all make it interesting and fun and I love it. Also I love how dedicated y'all are to this channel and to us the people who watch y'all's videos. Y'ALL ARE AMAZING!!!!!
I love the eerie music!
You are the best example for a cutest and happiest pair.
Thank you for the journey! There were some beautiful views.
Love my Tennessee peeps!! Oh and I never miss a video!  ❤ from Tennessee
Thank you for continuously thinking of cool new adventures!
Nate’s next physical challenge? Thru Hike the AT! 🥾🌲🚶🏻❤
you can get free wifi from Kara's forehead
I'm sure you'll never read this far down, but I have something to say. I started watching your videos at the start of the pandemic. At the same time, I started watching hiking vlogs of people hiking the three longest National Scenic Trails (AT, PCT, CDT). Even though most of the virus craziness is gone, I still watch you....and the hikers. I even suggested you guys hike the AT when you solicited ideas from your viewers months ago. This collision of worlds is blowing my mind. Thank you to you and all the hikers that pulled together to keep me sane for two years. Oh, and this year alone, I've traveled to europe, and last month I did my first solo backpacking trip.
Awesome adventure :) on a side note someone already has probably mentioned, you can get a piece of Tyvec from Homedepot/Lowe's for a ground cloth for your tent. Cheap and light :) Thanksgiving in a cup was an amazing idea.
Love the cute little knife you're going to use against hogs, hogs will rip you apart! Definitely looks like fun, but I personally don't go into the backcountry without a blaster. Just saying. Great video, looking forward to the next one.
Outstanding!
Nate: singing Rocky Top Me: Roll Tide Roll!!!  Btw, those mountains in the clouds at sunrise look just like the view from this incredible restaurant on a cliff in Big Sur. It’s called Sierra Mar. I highly recommend & if you google you will find pictures that remind you of those mountains at sunrise. I don’t even remember what the food was like but will never forget that view. There is an adjacent Inn with rooms built off the cliff, in a tree & in the mountain, boasting even more incredible views! However, you didn’t pay hundreds or thousands of dollars for your view, although it was just as amazing! 😍 You found it & then climbed a tall (sometimes shaky) tower to witness it, just the two of you. So as amazing as that restaurant is in Big Sur I’m not sure it can ever compare to that beauty. Love you both! Love your videos!
This may have already been asked and answered but who makes the water purification bottles you have? Fantastic videos always
Hydrate or die.
6:35 the "G-DRAGON" and "TOP" written on there 😂
Wow Nate has always been so cool and adventurous since college and that story of u not living in the mountains was so cute
You should go to Potter Valley California
YES!! One of my happiest moments was coming back into civilization after 4 days backpacking through Catalina.  The last hour was hiking through a downpour, and we were all completely soaked.  The connivence store bathroom had a HEATED HAND DRYER and we were all laughing/crying with joy. It was amazing.
Higuys, great video so far, I can't wait for part 2. I'm sure it's going be great!!
Love it.
I literally loving that hiking trial I live so close to there
So Freaking Sweet plus Amazing!!!! I love this! It's Beautiful ❤️
I would put the tent in the bunk shelter. Seriously off the ground, but protected from the critters.
I loved this adventure of yours, I am looking forward for the part 2 😁
Out of complete curiosity, when you do these sort of events or activities do you have emergency contacts or people who can check in on you in a crisis? I personally love these type of off grid adventures but I worry about those things, no matter how good a shape you are in there are just so many unknowns that things can turn south quick.
such a great video!  I loved all the  pictures y'all shared💕👍
in Iowa people on purpose make sandwiches of stuffing,  mashed potatoes, gravy and turkey.      So to me what Nate wanted to do was completely normal.
do you guys see yourselves continuing van life overseas? ie. europe, asia? australia? or canada?
11:57 is my dream. Maybe one day.
This is one of my favorite kara and nate video!!
Loved this video!
Nate is a peanut butter monster 🤣
We used to do a lot of back country mountain biking and we ate pilot bread with peanut butter, raisins, dried fruit and water.
we both watch your videos and thats what inspired us
My first time here. From the Philippines.
i love hiking me and my best friend hiked half of the appalachian trail
Loved it!! Excited for part 2!!
Anyone else absurdly jealous, but not of their lifestyle, but their love. Bright Eyes, in his song "Waste of Paint, writes "I love their love and I am thankful / That somebody actually receives the prize that was promised / By all the fairytales that have drugged us"
You should always carry a firearm with you in the woods.
Please hike the Appalachian Trail next year!
A wild boar, mostly make boars, kill up to 7 humans a year. If they are very hungry, they will eat a human if the have to.
LOL- So there were a few times that the hair on the back of my neck stood up in this scary flick. LOL> skurred me...  twice!! lol
Awesome adventure.  Hope you stay bear-safe!
Kara's such a good sport.
You guys are in one of my favorite places! I just published my eighth novel, and it’s set right there in Great Smoky Mountains National park. 😊 This was a treat to watch. Thank you for taking us along. I can’t wait to see part 2.
Where did you got the Jet Boil?
What does the AG1 taste like?
Can we get some more international travel soon please.
Whatever (っ◔◡◔)っ  к⅋Ň  does ( even the breaks ) inspires us to how to live the life to the fullest! Your videos are good for us, as they contain Dopamine, serotonin, endorphins, and oxytocin. :)
Why is he marrying 50yo lady?
Does anyone know where Nate got that green hoodie he’s wearing on day 2??
A question for Nate or Kara, or for that matter anyone who would have tried AG1, what is the taste/ flavor like? Back to the woods, i wood have been screaming back to civilization if i had heard that scary noise..
Check out Flextail gear "tiny pump" for your air pads 😊
OMG, you guys love each other so much, it's adorable.
Yal are started about 30 miles for me. It’s such a beautiful hike. So happy to see you guys in the Great Smokey Mountains!! Adventures EVERYWHERE!!! So happy to see you guys doing this!!!! Not trying to be biased but this is my favorite travel Vlog that you guys have made in a long time. It might seem so simple but it’s just so real! Sending lots of love from the mountains of Western North Carolina!❤️🏕
How were the mosquitoes not eating y’all,alive in the first shelter?
5 days is pretty long! Can’t wait to see what happens next.
LOVE the bloopers, you guys!
The cinematography skills are seriously on point. This is stunning to watch!
Just recently hiked that trail! It's BEAUTIFUL! Glad you guys had a good time! Nothing beats the Appalachians.
the curly hair Nate!!!!!!!
why didn't you just weight the bag
Thanks!
Aaahhh college Nates hair!
Pigs have human like skin and cover themselves in mud to keep from getting sunburnt, smart animals
When are you going to do your 102 country??
Fantastic! Thank you!
Absolutely admire each of you and your relationship! Your adventures are always a welcome escape and motivation to keep pushing❤
Hog hunter here. Very dangerous to spook them out of nowhere so it’s best to make a lot of noise. They’re very fast and aggressive and if you fall over they can gut you. Please don’t anthropomorphize them. Sows have 4-12 babies per year and they are becoming very invasive, causing many problems for farmers. They carry a lot of diseases, so in addition to eating most of the other animals share of food in an area, they spread disease in communal water sources.
"If you can find the bear spray..."  ROFL
Next time you guys are thinking of actually going somewhere I have someone help you like at a outdoor store or an REI you need to bring less stuff with you so you don't have to throughout your back and I'm sorry to say Cara really needs to bring more than one shirt just go to an outdoor store and get help it's the wilderness so that's actually good advice for anything outdoorsy sorry if I'm being mean but I would actually pack everything a lot smaller a full jar of peanut butter will actually weigh you down just use an outdoor store when you have a chance I think you'll be much happier and if you're going to load up remember when Nate went on that ride with his brother and I think Dusty or something something along those lines would be better and that water bag you guys have that's definitely a must especially any inclement weather please talk to an expert it's almost the same thing when you're talking about ice and going into near Everest I know you have to pack your equipment too but talk to an expert see what you can get away with and they're called dry packs or something or dry food I'm not sure what it is REI and any outdoor store would be good at least three pairs of shirts extra socks is actually really good panchos that you can fold in they won't weigh as much and maybe for you guys hiking sticks maybe a little easier don't forget if you go somewhere in nature it's just nature they were there first
Omg Nate! That curly hair in the old pic with Kara! Haha😂
I sometimes get the impression that Nate makes Kara do these types of adventures.
Nate hitting his head twice is so funny 😂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Kara: the best mashed potatoes I have ever had. 😋 🤣🤣
App-a-latch-un Trail. Come on y’all are from TN. 🤣
Awesome job section-hiking the A.T through, probably one of the most beautiful sections of the trail, other than Grayson Highlands State Park in Virginia where the wild ponies roam (Kara would probably love that) and Mcafee Knob (Also in Virginia. I’m planning a 4 month thru-hike from Springer Mountain Georgia to Kathadin in February 2025 after I graduate from college. Thank you for giving me a peace of what it would be like and hopefully, someday Nate, you and Kara could achieve that dream and thru-hike the entire trail one day. You got this!!
Literally everything is nature, nature is everywhere- not just in the woods. Just saying. Also, ticks are in nature too- so check each other for’em.
Reminds me of the book A Walk Across America.
I feel like Nate keeps saying those shoes are getting thrown away and they keep returning 😂
27:33 New Transition Unlocked🔓     I know it's just a quick edit/transition, but I'm sure a lot of actual work went into doing that, and I wanted to say nice job!
I think y’all should hike the full AT. I have followed several people doing the trail. Yours would be very enjoyable to watch, because of your energy and personality. Nate there’s your challenge for you😉
The smokies are the best. I am glad they set these lands aside.
A flizard is now my new favorite animal 🤣🤣
Just love your vids andlove watching your interaction!  🥰
You know water purifies when boils
Hey if you come thru hiawassee ga lmk i will bring snacks and plenty of airbnb connections
Hey Kara and Nate did you folks ever consider trying freeze dried  foods for your camping trips?? If you or anyone else on here are interested please email and Carolyn and I can get you hooked up. Great vlogs by the way I really enjoy them very much  (Matt from Ontario)
I watched this this morning just have to say…I loved this one but was like,” WHAT OUR FOR SASQUATCH!!!” Oh my gosh! I watch too many Slapped Ham videos too 😂 Be safe on your travels by boat too!! 😊
The footprint weight doesnt add up to the weight of the grayle water filter lol. Lots of areas for improvement in losing weight!
I am afraid of snakes.
This hike is so cool..so great there are mini shelters..but would love to take along a rolling cart to carry most of the supplies..any mountain bikes up there?
I would have put the tent under the shelter haha . Good coverage but also protected from animals :p
Yall got the relationship I dream of. Stay happy and keep on lovin eachother n i prommised you will grow even bigger and better💪💪💪
you should talk more on the trail because bears will hear you and avoid  also boar and moose are pretty dangerous so try to avoid them and watch for sings of em
I would love to see more hiking videos
I’d love to see you guys visit more countries in Africa. There are 54 of them and I could easily be wrong but I think you guys have only been to a handful
Glad your getting to spend some time together..it’s so rare you get to see each other !
Ahhh. You guys were in my neck of the woods. Welcome back to the Smokies. The black bears aren't really out to get you. The mice may be tho!
Take mice over having a snake sleep me in one of the shelters.
Wild pigs. Will attack an kill a person  .so glad you got home safe  an had a good time dear family
nice! my husband and I have those exact same ultra light back packs....last time we went on a 5 day backpack we ran into a blackbear....and then again 2 days later....the first one ran right off...the 2nd one followed us (parallel to us off trail) for about 100 feet or so, scary but s/he also ran off...but we both had bear spray.. I can't imagine fighting off a bear (or whatever) with a knife. and stop whispering...talk loud, sing, bang a pot, be loud!!!  just another bit of advice, yea...don't eat where you are going to sleep if there are bears around... they can smell where food is and where it's been.  Don't even keep toothpaste or put good smelling hair product on...finally you can set up a small tent inside of the shelter...best of both worlds :)
What shoes do you use
Nate went from spending 2 days on a island starting with nothing right to going into too woods for five days I mean wow
Kara may be my favorite ever
Yay! No eamon and bec. I don’t watch any videos those two are in. They’re too fake
The "hey bear" literally made me lol
finally some wholesome Kara and Nate content that's not van life related 😄but goes to show being a tourist in your home state is fun sometimes!
We live a little down from the Appalachian Trail here in PA.
MIxing the potatoes and stuffing together, "Like a psychopath."  LOL.
This was a great video. Looking forward to the second half. I miss my days of hiking up in the Shenandoah Mountains in VA. The Smokey Mountains are just as beautiful. ❤
Fun fact: pugs use mud like we use pools; to keep cool!
I get so tickled watching you Nate. You get dry mouth and your upper lip gets stuck. Teasing you!!! Xoxo And omg I love your curly hair Nate!!!!
Probably not a good time to show you this movie trailer https://youtu.be/aa5MXOMN1lM
I absolutely love your outlook on life and the pursuit of gratefulness. You guys are amazing and I love watching you do these things! ❤❤
I enjoy my life of living in a Prius, camping deep in the woods. 🤠🤙  a oneness with nature is very grounding.  🙏
...I like the physical challenges
Maybe it's Bigfoot following you.   Most likely a bear.   Watch out for Yogi and Boo Boo!!!
That’s a great way to phrase it. Camping is a “gratefulness reset”. So true.
Also carry a rifle and shotgun and a Hugh fire
How about doing this but with another couple like eamon and bec-?????
Is it “frying pan lookout tower” you all went too? We’ve been eyeing it for a few months.
Backpacking is not for people to complain about anything it’s for enjoyment and nature!!!
The scenery in this video is absolutely amazing! Thanks for sharing your adventure.
I really loved what you said about appreciating the modern conveniences after camping! I lived in Romania for one year, many years ago! It was difficult to find food, at times there was no hot water and making a simple phone call could take hours! I loved though and miss many aspects of it while still really appreciating all our western culture affords us!
The camera quality is amazing in this video, the colors are so bright ❤
I know you will never see this post since a quarter of a million people have already seen this video, but I just have to ask if that was the Mt. Sterling Fire Tower? Thirty years ago, my husband and I hiked and camped at a fire tower on Mt. Sterling that looked just like that. We camped in the snow in a little tent and had to hike down the mtn to get water. You really brought back some awesome memories for us. Thanks!
I like the way you guys filmed this one, different style, set the mode 😊❤
You guys are mad crazy for going in some of the most conspired trails in America
A fishard 😂 🦎
I was so scared watching you two on that tower. Im terrified of heights I doubt I wouldve made it to the top. My stomach was turning watching. lol
3rd 😆   I recall being in 4th or 5th grade on a hike with my dad in the Smokies and learning 2 new things that day.  Beech trees have a dried orange leaf that curls and wild boars were a danger to humans on the trail.  I don't recall what trail we were on, but there were multiple signs about wild boars and it made me so scared!
As an AT thru-hiking alum this warmed my little heart!! I love all your videos of course usually because it’s places I haven’t been but this was nice and comforting. 🥹🥹
I love you two! You make something that looks scary, not be so scary!
hello kara and nate!would you mind to make a video in a small town in new england,north dakota..its really beautiful out there which the autumn 🍂 fall season already..i’ve seen this in trout and coffee vlog🥰
Y’all should go on the Jerry Springer show!!!
Y’all are so beautiful !!!!  I absolutely love you guys 🙌🙌🙌
How close Nate was to the edge at 21:38 literally gave me a heart attack... so high and so close to the edge. Ahhh.
There have been so many black bear's in Gatlinburg!! In town!!😂 I'd have been surprised if Y'all didn't see at least one bear!!
Lol I've always hated jelly so I've been having peanut butter chocolate chip sandwiches since elementary school 😂 it was the only thing my mom could find that I'd eat with peanut butter 😂 so glad to see I'm not alone in enjoying it, I used to get such weird looks when I told people what I was eating, I'd literally describe it as a Reese cup on bread lmao
I feel so lucky we get to come on all these adventures with you guys! It makes me so happy and I'm smiling throughout the whole video. You guys also are literally the cutest couple I have ever seen❤
How about a nice Dude Ranch in Wyoming? A roof, a shower, a bed, no mouse poop, and no bears!
Y’all left your door unlocked
I love your videos this especially it brings me back hiking the Appalachian trail which I ve seen in different states but regret not seeing more of it when I visited Tennessee ❤️ The wild boar really surprised me never thought that the first animal you'd see I thought deer chipmunks possibly bear 🐻 safe distance ofcourse  Love how this off grid time brings you and your mate even closer wonderful the weather tower was spectacular also amazing views 💕💕 🏔️🌄
App-ah-lah-chuh
thats interesting - I saw on your AG1 packet it says Made in New Zealand. I went to the AG1 website off one of your other vlogs and they don't ship to NZ - only US, Canada and Aussie. Umm confused.
Do you think Nate realizes the jetboil has a built in igniter and doesn't need to use a lighter to start it?
I’m shocked at the way a Tennessee boy mispronounces Appalachian 😜
Love it that you went backpacking!  I didn’t look, but I’m sure there’s a bunch of people punking out your gear, but don’t let it get you down.  If you want to make backpacking a bigger part of your life, you can get your weight down a bunch.  Just going out and being in the woods is the main thing!
I think we should rename the salamander to flizard.
I've been working a seasonal job in a national park since June and I'm loving it. Being out in the wilderness is such a nice break from normal life and it was incredible to have a job that allowed me to drive around a beautiful park all day and go on some awesome adventures on the weekend. So glad you guys got to enjoy some time out in the woods!
You should do pacific crest trail next from Mexico to Canada
"We are going to take this trip nice and easy." Meanwhile, carries a very heavy backpack with the plan to hike 31 miles over the next five days.
y'all talk and explain too much sometimes
Come on guys your from Tennessee it’s AppA-latch-ian trail!! 😂😂 my husband hiked 500+ miles and I hiked about 100 with him haha.
A flizzard hahahaha!!!!  Kara your so funny!
LOL at 16:15 the "horror movie" style of music was hilarious!😅
I just got off the AT in GA! Great hike!
I love your physical challenge videos! Forget the haters
Be safe and have fun  wherever you go 😊
I would totally love to watch you guys hike the entire AT! I hiked a small section today in NJ with my family.  i would love to do the entire trail!
Your videos always make my day better. Thank you so much for making these! You both are amazing! =]
Anyone else here because of YouTuber diywife?
Welcome to My hometown guys I hope you enjoyed our mountains..
- We have to hang the Chapstick because......Bears are attracted to the scent of Chapstick. .... ... .. Me - Sooooo. If Nate catches a bear kissing Kara we know why. 😆😆💔👄💋
Nate: Hey bear  Bear: Hey Nate
So much growing and learning you are doing. You are half my age and I so wish I could go back and do some of these things. Life has a way of working things out. May this trip be restful (not necessarily in a physical sense) and joyful. Thanks for sharing. PS…my knees shook as I watched you climb that observation tower; I could not have done that. Glad you were able to; the footage was amazing!! ❤️
I'm sure it's not feasible with your schedule, business, and YT channel... but a Nate and Kara take on the Appalachian Trail series would be the best content on YouTube.
Suggestion for another physical challenge for you: every year on the 4th of July in Seward Alaska they have a race UP Mt Marathon,  pretty steep and very beautiful scenery.
14:08 any man with that hair needs to protect AT ALL COSTS! Any person who wants to be with them!!
Nate, buddy, we are not going to ignore your hairstyle at 14:08.  Who did you think you were, Kevin Jonas?????
Great to watch you in our Smokies ❤️.  Love to watch you but especially since you are fellow Tennessean 's.  I have hiked a lot in the Smokies also, been to the tower at Mt Sterling. We were in Cades Cove at night one time and saw a couple of wild hogs ,  I understand how that gets your full attention lol.
Omg Nate is crsi
I love nates physical challenge videos tho!
You guys should totally do the John Muir Trail!!!!❤
Wow Katy Perry didn't just do that🤯🤯🤯 https://youtu.be/nZZQVXo6-x4
Been following you for Three years!! ❤
😂Sweethearts!! This is also Bigfoot County!! Don’t want to freak you out post hike..but .. loving you freaks from Maine.. I’m soooo happy I  found you kids.. 60 year old former obsessive backpacker!! I live vicariously thru you and all my other You Tube Travel Loves!! I love ❤️ you so much!!!
Enjoyed your hiking adventure. You should make more of these. Btw, bear spray goes on you shoulder strap we’re you can grab it in .5 seconds. Not in the pack.
How cool?! You guys are backpacking! Some of the best times in my life have been backpacking or camping, and I don't mean glamping! My sister and I were initiated into backpacking as a course from CSUN that was, "The Natural History of the Sierra Nevadas". We started out of Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite for a 5 day hike to the valley floor. The first night bears raided our camp. Most of us hung our food sacks 10 feet up a tree and away from the tree trunk, but a couple of people decided to hang their food on a park provided food sack chain that was hung between two trees. Even though we has posted rotating watches and tried to scare the bears off, banging on pots and pans,  a little family of bears got the food bags that were hanging on the food bag chain! The bears are so smart! It was a mother and her two cubs. She sent her two cubs up each of the trees that held the ends of the chain. They were instructed to sit on the tree limbs so that the chain dropped lower. The mother bear stood up under the bags and was able to catch hold of the bags! Our two companions lost all of their food, but the rest of us shared our food with them. After that our hike was scenic and fun! We made friend with other hikers, including two hikers who shared their wine with us! You are right, roughing it in the wild gives a sense of freedom and a greater appreciation for everything when we get back home! Backpacking is the best! Thanks for the post!
You two are BETTER people than I will ever be!!!  You Guys 💎!!!
Wild boars are extremely dangerous. Their about that life LOL.
Another lovely video.  However, I keep meaning to ask you something KARA.....where did you buy your world necklace?  Every time I see it on you, I love it and I want one!  Please tell me 😁😁
love Ya'll
The metric conversion on screen were greatly appreciated haha. With love from Australia! ✌❤
In Arkansas they want those wild hogs killed off They destroy everything and they are dangerous
i could never hike in shorts. Long pants for me always!! <3
Lol odds are it was a squirrel making all that noise🤣 I've been out so much, hear this  "big" movement in the brush, freaked out thinking it was a big animal..... annd...it was a stinking squirrel 🤣
Loving the videos... I'm sad about AG1 though... I live in NZ and it doesn't ship here so I can't try in even though I really want to! Then today I noticed that it says its made in NZ! How crazy that its made here yet doesn't ship here... Absolutel madness! 😢🤣🤣
I’d rather sleep on top of that old look out - than on the ground.  But, probably not a good idea.  But, after you saw an army of boars,   But, fun vlog - I can smell the pine.
I find heights challenging, my hands were sweating while watching you climb the fire tower and I was just lying in bed🤣. Looking forward to next instalment. Thank you
You guys are hilarious! I always watch with a smile on my face. 😄
Yall should hike the whole trail. I mean why not.
from hawaii here! we have tons of wild boars on trails and hiking spots. they're very dangerous when provoked or protecting youngs, but mostly they just run away and keep to themselves. you leave them alone, they leave you alone. LOVE THE VIDEOS! STAY SAFE!
Stop when nate says " well now everybody knows" and then pats kara on the shoulder
I hear there going to knock down that fire tower.  A few people have jump from it
It's Big Foot
I am cracking up so hard at the inhale before she puckers up. It’s amazing how you get to know your partner’s little quirks. This was the cutest!
I love your videos and genuine perspective! I want to be friends with you guys!!
I love your lovey dovey videos so much! #couplegoals
20:00 masala
y’all singing rocky top out of nowhere was so triggering lmao but go vols baby!!!!
Hope you're carrying a big F'ing gun for those bears and hogs
The Great Smoky Mountains Are So Beutiful They Are Perfect for Going of the grid to relax
I love Nate’s challenge videos tho 😊
Lion's, tiger's and bears, oh my!
You guys brought up two important points about backpacking: 1) it makes you grateful for garbage pickup, flushable toilets, showers, and water faucets; and 2) it is nice to work for your scenery -- a hard hike usually brings great rewards (beauty, solitutude, etc).  I loved this video!  It's nice when you guys get back to the basics and just simply exist.
we need a break/vacation from our always on break/vacation job
Those webs are made by orb weavers... Totally harmless spiders
Maybe it will show up in the video however I didn't hear bear bells. If you're around running water a goat bell is even better 🤣.
yes i get it, that sense of gratitude you feel when you get home after living in such conditions
"A flizzard" 👍 🦎
:( before my comments, just letting u guys know I was a girl scout patrol leader, also an office during CAT (like a citizen army training) and we did so many camping learning to survive the wild. Im glad i finished all those but im glad its done. So watching this kinda send me back to those moments. Wilderness is not my thing. Im not hating this content but not loving it. To add it up im afraid of heights. So when Nate tried to show the wood in the steps moving around I suddenly felt weak like fainting. 😂 its wierd just watching gives me anxiety.. Esp the rat 🐀 part. lord! That was it for me.. I will wait for the next travel vlog.
THAT TOWER MADE MY KNEES WEAK OMG lol dont do that again lol
Since you guys love nature why not build a cabin in the woods hehehe
I completely lost it at the Flizzard
I have had such a bad day and opening YouTube to see a new video from y’all put a smile on my face❤
Did you know that the Great Smoky Mountains are the most visited national park?
I didn't even notice the video was 30 min.  I thought it was like 10-15.
You guys are awesome
Could we have links for those sleeping pads? Especially the foot pump one. Thanks!
I am surprised you didn't get some of those ultra light hammocks and get the super thin tarp to protect from rain. You can even get bug nets for it.
Carry a gun when out in the wilderness
Even though this is tough I'm sure it was nice to just get out and enjoy nature for a few days :)
hi Kara and Nate sorry to bother you but what do you use to edit your videos because you always make then look so nice
Awesome video.. honestly I’d love to do it but I’d need more than a knife and bear spray to feel safe. And I’m not sure if I could fit what I think I’d need in a 40 pound pack. I love your videos for seeing all your adventures I wouldn’t be able to see with out the videos and what an awesome couple you are! Couple goals for sure! Love y’all!
Hello from Minnesota!!! Love backpacking! Kara is totally right on the "gratefulness reset" I think this is one of your best episodes to date.  Thank you!🙏🙏
The views in this one 😮❤
That was some hair Nate
So with all the camera shots how far do you actually end up hiking?
you can do it
go guys
I got more enjoyment out of watching Kara eat instant mashed potatoes than watching most food tours from other creators.  I will watch you two do or go anywhere.  I love that you are genuine and real in front of the camera.  My husband has told me on several occasions that he loves watching me smile while watching Kara and Nate.  Keep doing the things you enjoy, it really shows well on camera. Cheers
Stove Top and instant mashed potatoes are the ultimate quick comfort food and I love that you ate that while in the woods.
As a native to WNC, welcome to our back yard!
Ok I just have to say Nate had amazing hair like wow
I live about 5 minutes from the National park.  Fun fact, the entire reason you have to purify water everywhere there is because of the wild hogs.  They get their poo in the water so even pristine streams are contaminated.  They aren’t natural either.  Years ago they were brought in from Europe for hunting camps in the early 1900’s and they reproduced rapidly.
Haven't watched the rest of episode yet, but I just wanted to say that I really like "Nate's physical challenge videos"  The Colorado Trail mountain biking brought me into the channel.  While I know, they're not the main focus of the channel, I really like them when they pop up.  Edit: I loved this video too.
There’s some rules about that part of the country in those words no you did not hear anything if somebody says your name no you did not hear that move on
You don't carry bear mace? That's a necessity for hiking in my opinion.
I have that same filtering water bottle! I bought it to use in Guatemala and was very happy with it!
i love all your video's x
Todays video reminded me of my favorite moment in any of your videos.  When Nate was inflating his sleeping pad and singing Rocky Top,  it reminded me when Nates Dad was doing a little dance and singing it in the hills of Macchu Picchu.  My favorite part ever.
I like Kara and Nate -- I really do -- but these recent series tell me they're running out of ideas to keep the channel going. I for one have no interest in these survival adventures (Panama, Canada and this). Either go places you haven't visited or give up the channel and do something else such as mentoring others wanting to do the same thing. I know I'm being blunt, but this is getting monotonous.
My husband is the exact same way about food! When we travel he always needs snacks and worries about where/when our next meal will be. 😆
Y'all should hike up to Mount LaConte at some point, but in the winter.
I would have slept up in that Tower..I would have slept alot better unless u think u might roll right off lol
Always look forward to and enjoy your adventures 😀
Pigs do love mud, it helps keep them cool since they don't sweat much.
Magiques 🧙‍♀️
Harriet and I have hiked in Great Smoky Mountains. Its 'so beautiful. We never camped. The question we have is what kind of noises were you hearing at night and did you sleep well ?  Will you do it again.  Sending you much love from Richmond, Va.🙏🙏  Harriet and Jim
I hope you filmed your yacht experience!! thx for your videos! love you all.
How much did LL BEAN  and REI pay you to advertise their stuff?
Guys just as a heads-up, your hiking outfits are definitely not ticks safe. Be careful, and thanks for this adventure, I love outdoors 😊
I love you guys love how you are always trying something new xx
Your travel videos used to be so interesting and entertaining, now it seems all of your videos are about wilderness challenges. Bring back your travel and hotel stays or buckeyes type videos.
The tent transition was great guys hahahahaa
Great Fullness reset that has to be the best explanation. Love y'all Kara and Nate.
The tarp that goes under the tent is called a “ground cloth”. It’s purpose is to help keep moisture from coming through the floor of the tent and getting your gear wet. Hope you enjoy your journey!
What a truly wonderful place to be. Just shows that you don't need all the high adrenaline stuff to have a great time. You two have such a wonderful relationship xx
Kara, we the people desperately want to know where y’all got those hoodies at that have the cinched hood!
Yayyyyyy finally seeing your video pop up makes my day!
who the hell complains about Nate's outdoor challenge videos?  they'd rather take another tour of a bathroom? DO NOT LISTEN TO THOSE PEOPLE. DON"T STOP CHALLENGING YOURSELVES.  GO GO GO!!!!
Hey Kara and Nate. I just wanted to say I love watching your videos, they really do capture the beauty of the world around us. I wanted to also talk about something that Ive noticed I haven't seen spoken about in your videos: Religion. Now I'm not sure what you believe in or where your faith may lie. But I wanted to implore you of the seriousness of having faith in Jesus Christ. I know that you both have been quite observant of the world around us, everything is becoming worse and worse (the world economy, famine, high prices, global warming, wars etc) and I'm not sure if it's ever made you curious as to what's going on? Well the truth of it is that these are sure signs that Jesus is coming back and as He predicted in the Gospels, these "birth pains" will only become worse and worse until He actually arrives again. Now why do you need Jesus Christ in your life? Because you're a sinner? What is sin? Transgression of God's moral law. How are you a sinner? Because you are the seed of Adam who you've inherited his sin nature and therefore sin and transgress God. So, as such because you and I transgress God's law (by lying, stealing, lust, covete ) then we are in danger of being under God's wrath and judgement and his Judgement against sinners is an eternity in Hell. However, God also loves us but he cannot pardon our sinful acts otherwise he'd be corrupt. Therefore, Jesus steps in. He stayed the wrath of God on us. How did he do that? By dying on the cross for the sin of the world, for your sins and for mine. He, the blameless and sinless child of God went to the cross, took our sin debt and paid it in full through His death. His resurrection from the grave on the third day signals that his payment for our sins was successful and sufficient for all those that put their trust and faith in Him and are therefore saved form God's wrath. How do you be saved? First you should repent (turn away) from your sins and second you should put your faith in Jesus Christ and what he did on the cross because that signals that you can't do anything worthwhile, outside of Christ, to earn your place in Heaven because only and eternal sacrifice can ensure your eternal life beyond the grave. I pray that you share this  Gospel with your followers because it'll do them a whole lot of good better than anything you can give them! And please of you'd like to know more about this consideration searching on YouTube the pastors Voddie Bauchum, John MacArthur, Paul Washer, TreasureChrist( YouTube channel), Reformed Channel (YouTube channel). Please please please do this and God bless!
I was watching this and then it said the video wasn’t available anymore for a good 2 hours
Do you think your PRVKE bags would have held up for this? I just bought the 31L and am so excited!!
We were on this hike where we go multiple times in an year and i was going down the mountain and like 15 wild boars small and big one ran in frond of me luckely no one was hurt but like it was beatiful but i would be scared if we would be sleeping there but i will never forget that moment
Big Foot!!
So happy to see a new video from you guys! I generally save them for when I sit down with a cup of tea or have a cat on my lap. Always enjoyable! (I do have to admit I did think “Oh no, not another one of Nate’s challenges. 😂 Some are fun, some stress me out.) Beautiful setting and glorious views!
If your there and have no gun of any kind you are nuts. I would be more afraid of a wild hog.
You two are truly amazing to watch. I dont know how you two do the things you do. Climbing that tower, camping in the woods I just could never do it. I am also a scaredy cat lol. ❤
Aww sad rich people who travel constantly need to decompress.
Y'all should hike the whole Appalachian trail!
Literally just checked into our cabin in the Smokies and saw this video. So cool! Favorite place in the world
and people think Australian wildlife is dangerous.......... I'd have been eaten by a bear inside of the first day.....chapstick can attract them?  Really?   Think I will stick to my Aussie snakes and spiders and just enjoy the American great outdoors via video, you guys can risk the bears for me.
A FLIZARD
You should fry the tortilla thing and sprinkle it with cinnamon
You should carry protection,  bear spray,  a weapon,  super air tight containers for storing your food
I like Nate's "physical challenge videos" ♥️ and Kara I love how you put in the Friends introduction for each day when you edit for multiple day videos xxx so cute
man i was so tense when it was the wild boar bit
Ya
I love Appalachia. Maybe because it is home but man it’s just so beautiful. ❤
That noise in the woods is just a samsquanch. Just don't take pictures of it if you want to stay alive. 🤣 Awesome hike tho, great work as always. Keep up the awesome content. Stay strong and safe! 🤙🍻🇨🇦
Sign missing at bottom of fire tower says " Condemned ! NO ENTRY " 🤣🤣
Well I love the these adventures as well as the Nate's physical challenges...xoxox from Dallas Texas ❤️❤️❤️
Very lucky, you have a beautiful contrary
I am the only one who was nervous when they were up the tower!!
Please someone tell me where Nate got his green hoodie! I love it so much.
Nate!  You look like Donny Osmond with all that curly hair!  Love your vlog Nate and Kara! xx
You are going to love your time on the trail
Okay I am not positive but I think Pigs do not have sweat glands and this is why they like the cool mud to get cooled down.
You go first .... Me?😮 😅
I understand how it feels to be outdoors. Whenever I need to go to work, I walk rather than drive. It's an hour away, but it was enough for me to relax and take in what little scenery I have in my neighborhood. I avoid using technology and instead observe what I can. I even get to look at the deer when they cross my path. 😊
Love the channel. This vid is great, but did I see drone footage from inside a national park? 🤔
You guys should go on the Amazing Race show!!!!!
This is awesome!! I live very close to the start of the trail and man it’s a Journey, glad y’all had a great time going camping this week!
Kara on all your adventures what are your favorite shoes?
flizard!!!!!
Don’t know if anyone ever mentioned this but, I don think the bears wait for you to find the bear spray! 🐻 I think you’re supposed to carry it front of you and not in the backpack. 😂 Just a thought.
can't explain why, but this might be the best video you've done. It's just feels very pure, with nature. Weird right, but in a good way!
You have to really STRETCH those tie downs as far as it will go to get all the ample space.
The mud cool them
Fun video, I wish I didn't immediately think that Summer Wells disappeared about 60 miles away.  Yikes.
LOL but isn't it WOMEN first?? lol!!! I would not go first I do not think hmmmmm
I hate heights but that view from the tower was amazing.
I lost all feeling in my legs looking at yall on that tower!!!!🥴🥴🥴🥴
OH YEAH, it is not just set miles for you so to say since you always have to back track to get the camera lol.
Here I was thinking the tower looked like a possible place to sleep to feel safe from bears but then you climbed it and it was tiny and shaky and terrifying haha
See this is the kind of hiking that looks fun. I just don’t like to feel like I’m going to fall to my death
Best place ever to hike. I could sit and listen to the water flow for hours in the Smokey Mountains.
I was watching Eva zubecks Alaska trip and I was thinking I wonder when Nate will want to take on that challenge 🤣🤣
Hey guys, i was just wondering what camera gear you use. Like your drone and cameras.
LMAO @KARA Her attention span at one part was all over the place lol
This is the like 3rd video Kara says her feet smell! Which can be natural obviously but I gag every time now lol
LOL I just have to say 6 mile hikes everyday does NOT sound relaxing but good exercise
Nate, did you really have that hair when you were younger? Hilarious
Most hunters say that a wild boar can be more dangerous and aggressive than a wild bear. Wild boar carry dangerous diseases Most of us see wild boar as dangerous because of the potential attack and known attacks they can cause
*Love your curly long hair Nate. I would have not known that was you.!!* ❤️
The rest of the world would of been fine with you rounding it up to 50kms lol
This video made me smile so much <3 watched till the very end haha
Not another one of nates fitness videos 😀
Yeah at first I did not think your where on the Apalachee Trail until I saw the cabin and was like OH they are there, lol.
👍
I know your suppose to hang your food in a tree so the BEARS do not get it, but BEARS climb trees, so this I also am confused with lol.
Still in shock with college Nate
I've been camping and hiking in the Smokies since I was a kid. My whole family did it together. Let me tell ya! It is definitely the definition of "roughing it"! When it gets dark, you can't see your hand in front of your face! All I can remember getting to the end of all of it was.........God! I would kill for a can of Coca Cola!!!
New post!! Did you guys know u r in a mrbeast video?
“Gratefulness Reset”!! Love that!! That’s how I feel watching your videos!! Thanks for sharing your adventures!! They are so great!! ❤️💫
Always so excited when you guys do adventures like this!
So whenever I get on YouTube, I always end up wasting my time.. so my compromise is that I only allow myself to watch your guys’ videos.. it’s been a great compromise 👌🏻  Also have you ever looked into if Nate has sleep apnea? My husband found out he had it when he was 26 (we though only old people had it 😂) and now he doesn’t snore anymore with his cpap machine! 🙌🏻
First of all, i absolutely loved this video and secondly, Thankyou for showing me places I will never be able to see myself but you have such a gift that I feel like I am seeing this with you. If you ever come back to the uk give me a shout and I will show some beautiful places we have on our doorstep. Xxx
Love ur videos , more travel videos plzzz and less woods 😂
I love it, you guys are hilarious 😂
I am even scared of a bear by only watching the video🤣 great episode, loved the calmness💕
when she says third 😢🎉❤
I am going to do something similar next year through Sweden. I call it the journey of coming out of my comfort zone😃
I couldn't stop laughing at the end lol🤣
Bear spray on your hip belt or somewhere easy to grab! Yep gotta have it where there’s bears and big cats!!! Love the video guys!!!!
Where I run daily there are tons of wild bore .... they have poor eye sight if your quite they will leave you alone . Not that this helps you now but just so you know for next time....
I would LOVE for follow a VLOG of you guys hiking the AT!
The mountains in the morning were amazing! I've been up a few fire towers... they definitely scare me!
rubbsih
You know you are a strong couple when you can anticipate kisses! ❤️🤣
There is another adventure you guys might like.  Canoeing the Green River in Utah.  You can rent a canoe in Moab and they will take you to the river.  The river feeds into the colorado.  That should be your last day in that corner area because the further you go down the river gets quite rough.  Make arrangements (before you start the river trip) for them to take you back up the colorado to Moab on a pontoon boat,  Also bring a portable toilet, please,
Sometimes being in the woods or nature is a great place to reset take it from a city girl who married a country boy that sometimes you just need to be on the trail!!
19:33 That's what she said 🤣🤣🤣  I am sorry, it's was necessary 🤭
Yeah you could kill me before I would go into a forest full of bears 😂
Noravirus from the mice . . . Lyme disease from the ticks.   I am at two with nature but it's enlightening to watch you two being fearless!
Loved the 😘😘😘 at the end 🥰💛
I like Nate with all the hair. Awww
Not so great to start a video by making fun of your viewers.
Wait did you say 2001. That’s when Rick and bec hiked the trails pregnant that doesn’t add up lol.  Their kids aren’t 19 or 20 lol
Nate we need the curly fro back
i look forward to watch all your adventures!!!
Did anyone else think about where the crawdads sing when they went in the fire tower?
Sorry but stuffing and mashed potatoes are still the same thing as freeze dried. It's not fresh.
I really love all of your off grid and physical challenge videos! Keep them coming, we don`t mind :)
*Alot of people set their tent's up under the shelter.*
Dear Kara and Nate we have a good video suggestion next January is Elvis birth month so we think you guys should go to Graceland for Elvis birth week in early January you can stay in the Graceland rv lot with the van we think it would be an awesome video please consider this!!!!!!! Thanks
One of my favourite videos from you guys
Lol. You are barely around. Vacations must be so tiresome.
I love how you switch up really simple with luxury. The simple bits are always the more interesting.
Come back to NZ! so many amazing hikes and no bears or snakes!
Yo is that the 'hills have eyes' outlook??
☾︎❤︎☽︎
can kids have AG1
You both are the reason I'm working on getting a vehicle big enough to travel the states. You convened me to visit all 50 states. And you're both adorable. Thank you for doing what you do.
For some reaason youtube said this was a private video after about 1 minute and killed it, and i couldnt find in my history. Luckily i hadnt direct clicked it so i could still find it again.
Ok… don’t do that!! Stay public!!!  Love your videos!!!
Since you don't shy away from colabs, i wanted to say that Joe Robinet would be a great guy to spend a week or two in the wilderness... :)
That was weird. I was watching to the AG1 part then is said it was private and then after I restarted the app I had to search for it and it’s working again. Weird.
hi ya Kara and Nate ty for sharing love the videos :) stay safe and blessed
GREAT Video, Kara and Nate! I LOVE the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. I actually asked if it was the Smokies on IG when I saw the post, there is no denying that beautiful park. I need to hike in Cosby. My dream is to hike Alum cave trail to Mount Leconte. I could only imagine going to school at UTK, and being so close to the park, that would be torture for me!! I am from very close to Tennessee, (North Georgia, close to Chattanooga), and I cannot ever find enough time to spend up there. I enjoy all of y'all's videos, but this is definitely a favorite now, as it hits so close to home. Thank you!
I've spent many a summer surrounded by american black bears, the kinds near you. They are generally scared of us so the way to go is let them be, stay away from cubs, and scream and clap to get them to run away.
Do you guys fight over who gets to lick the spoon clean 🤣😅
I have no idea how they keep doing all these grueling adventures! I would do like one of their adventures a year!! They are just go go go go!🤯 THEY ARE TRUE LEGENDS!🙌
I feel Nate takes a lot of chances with their lives.  No grudman in case of emergencies???  I hope so.😎🏜❤🌩🌩🌩I'm a very cautious person. I have backup plans for my backup plans.  Lol.  So, where's the bear spray?
Love you guys ❤
kara looks so cute
Hey! You two should hike the whole Appalachian trail next year. 👍
Really nice video guys! 😊
You know, it would be pretty neat to see you guys stay in a haunted location with Eamon & Bec... Just saying.. lol
Boars are 100% more dangerous than bears, they don't scare off from loud noises like bears will.
Wow I’m amazed by Bec hiking the trail while pregnant!
I love the disco lights.  It shows the love when you share a tent that small.
So AG1 is great; but the texture is harsh
Do you guys travel with a  g¥n?? You need to! Yikes! I’m only 9 minutes in and I’m stressed!😬
I don’t even like sitting on my porch because nature….this video stresses me out 🤣🤣 but I’m so glad y’all are enjoying it lol!
Goodluck hopefully it goes to plan.
Nope...I'll leave these kind of trips for you guys! My son would love it though.
at least you didn't serve 76 days in jail I did I been out since September 19th
I'm a 5'7" woman (back then quite muscled being a former weightlifter) and I thought nothing of hiking with a 50lb backpack. I didn't figure out backpacking was so hard (I enjoyed the challenge) because of the weight until a got into ultralight backpacking and my first hike, in that mode, was a 35lb pack (still heavy for ultralight).  Shelters?! Never spent a night in a shelter. Always had to bring a tent w/ tent stuff. Anyway, HOLY MOLY! I could jump over logs instead of slither over them. LOL! 😂 The lighter the better. I try for minimalism in all my life now.
I tried AG1 through your guys code and it somehow messed with my hormones and made me start my period 10 days early 🙄 also the flavor wasn’t the greatest even when I added some sugar so I sadly won’t be continuing my monthly subscription! Sorry to have a negative review but I just wanted to let you guys know cause I really love supporting your channel!
You can have it, I don’t want it. Mice,spiders, carrying 40lbs for miles, pooping in the woods, hydrated food, BEARS. Nope, don’t want it. I’ll just look out my window and enjoy the wild turkeys, javelina, mule and white tail deer that wander into my yard. I live in the Ponderosa Forest in Arizona.
At least you got your flip-flops
You guys are the best!! Thanks for taking us along on your adventures
♥️♥️♥️
Thank you for converting miles into kilometres!
Kara you came after a waffle on Nates list.  Lol!!!!!  This was so fun to watch. Nice job guys!
Ok.... I went along with you because you said it was not a survival thing. The scenery was beautiful. But here is my comment. I know you enjoy what you're doing so do what you like doing. I'm a chronic pain sufferer. All I see is pain and stress except for God's beauty. So let's make a deal. You do what makes you happy. I'll watch what makes me happy. Neither of us will feel guilty for not pleasing the other. I really enjoy your videos and a lot of it is that you keep your attitudes so positive, and I need that lift to make it through my days. So let's agree. I'm OK. You're OK... OK??
Loved this video but OH MY GOODNESS….that fire tower😱. My stomach flipped multiple times when I saw how unsafe it is.  I’ve been in similar, unsafe fire towers before, but this one was so much taller!
"It's like a lizard with fish scales,... A flizard!"     -Kara, 2022
I’m eating and watched the bathroom tour 😅😅🤮 wrong timing for me 🤣🤣 keep up the good work Kara and Nate
i love nate’s physical challenge videos😂😂
Kara: I keep getting a whiff of...one of our snacks
NATE🥹🥹🥹 you made the right decision now you can live your dream with Kara, this warmed my heart I needed that🫶🏼
What were you on scholarship for Nate???????
what you guys are drinking out of are springs. Completely clean to drink 😂
Our first backpacking trip was back in 1976, we were in the military, stationed in Idaho and decided on Friday, after work to backpack the next day into the Sawtooth Mt range.  So........not having any money to go get backpacking food, we froze a gallon of water in a plastic milk container so we could keep the dozen eggs, bacon and whatever else we needed to keep cold, cold while we hiked 3 miles into 3 lakes country.  We were both in our middle twenties and will ALWAYS remember this trip as the longest 3 mile hike we ever did!!  I was in tears a couple of times during the hike and couldn't even look up to see the beauty of the woods around us until we were on the way back.  We cooked EVERYTHING we brought out with us just so we wouldn't have to pack it out!!  What a great memory, even though it really was the worst backpacking trip we ever did!! LOL  Smoky Mts are beautiful!!  Have always wanted to do the Applachian Trail, but never got too.
You’re so brave! My stomach hurt so much when you were showing how sketchy the tower was. But the view was amazing! Thanks for bringing us along. 😊
I gotta say, all the goofiness in this one reminded me of your older travel vlogs and I love it!!! Y'all are too cute. Thanks for taking us along!
Brilliant. Great  experience. Enjoy x
What about Pop’s and his VW camper .?
I'm so glad you guys had fun. It takes a special kind of person to hike that trail. Too bad I'm not physically fit to do it myself. But you do appreciate the things in your life once you go back to the modern world. If I was kind of hoping you'd find Bigfoot. LOL. Can't wait for the next video
I think it would be cool if you hiked the whole Appalachian Trail!! That’s cool that they have pulley’s so you can put your packs up easily! I did the boundary waters trip twice in High School and yup we had to throw the rope over the tree limb and haul it up ourselves! We could just drink out of the  lake too didn’t boil it or purify it! Motor boats weren’t allowed but guess we’re lucky we didn’t get sick!
Ordered my first order of AG yesterday. Cannot wait to get on the AG band wagon! ❤️
Was thoroughly enjoying this video until you sang Rocky Top lol. GO CATS!
You need a break? Really? From what? Thousands of people would trade lives with you in an instant. You need a break! LMAO!
You guys are such a cute couple!
A 360 camera would be fun…
Lol. Love Nate’s college hair!!!
Well done you two, I must say I felt a little sick when ye were showing us some of the weak boards, so scarey. Look forward to part 2.
great video the woods makes you appreciate even the smallest of things. You guys should try a couple challenge or maybe a hypnosis video where you guys learn about each other.
I absolutely love to see you guys back in the van. I've kind of really enjoyed the randomness your channel has gone through because of the pandemic.
oooh college Nate had great hair!
I low-key had no idea Boar were dangerous! As a child and also with my friends as a teenager we used to wild camp all the time in the Forest of Dean here in the UK…they’re rampant around there…we’d have them running around our tent in the night making so much noise but we loved it! Not thinking we could possibly die 😂
You don’t need to hang your entire backpack. Just your food bag.
You saw a flizzard ???? WOW 😃🐟🦎you lucky girl !
Nice
if you watch game of thrones you know what wild boar could do ;)
how about you guys just bite the bullet and make a through hike of the AT?
hahaha Kara "third" buahahhaa like old matrimony XD
I really enjoyed this! You're a great couple, doing something brave and adventurous, in a beautiful place,  with amazing video skills. A combo for success. 🌄
Best kind of wife. Who you know you can do something with and make the best of everything. Excited for the best video.
Pigs don’t sweat.  So they cover themselves in mud to keep cool.
Damn! This is my dream video for as long as i know you guys , I LOVE great smoky mountains and I love you guys. I have been there
We love your videos, y’all. However, it’s pronounced appa-LATCH-un, not appa-LAY-chun. The A’s are equal in pronunciation.
You should carry some trail mix with you with some banana chips, raisins, nuts and berries. Good all around energy.
The next time you get to Tennessee try jonesborough it's the oldest town in Tennessee
As a backpacker, I see my rookie-self in you guys! HaHa. Great video, but be careful, backpacking can change your life! Thanks for sharing your Dash!!!  -  Davey.
I must have replayed at least 3 scenes several times just giggling. Oh and I’m pretty sure you’re running out of PB with that whopping gob Nate put in his last tortilla. It was like a Chipotle PB burrito over there. Lol
A group of friends and I went on a backpacking trip to the west coast of British Columbia in early June. Part of me honestly thought we would run into you two.   So, since on this trip you're come into my world let me give you some tips. 1- You're working way too hard with that JetBoil. Fully assemble it - fuel, burner, and pot - then pour in water. Well, unless you've gotten water from the creek/lake in the pot, then remove it from the stove before dipping the water. Regardless, the filled pot works best if attached to the stove when lighting. And put the lid on. The water will boil quicker.  And yes, I said unfiltered water. I seldom filter the water I cook with. 30 seconds of boiling will make water safe to drink anywhere in the contiguous US unless the water had harmful toxins in it.  2- I take a "dirty water" bottle on trips. Then I don't have to take a second trip back to the water source in the morning to make breakfast. All my water for the day got filtered the night before and I'm ready to go.   3- Nut butter packets. They're way lighter and less bulky than a jar. Get them at the grocery store. We also do flavored tuna packs on tortillas for lunch. So good.  4- Trekking poles. Once you're used to them you can't not have them.  That trip looks amazing. The view rivals anything in the west. And though I know you've been through Utah remember that you still haven't been *to* Utah.  Block out a couple of months and come see it. Joking, not joking.  I love what you said about appreciating modern conveniences. The first meal after a long trip eating out of bags is the best. The first ice cream too. We went to Red Fish Blue Fish in Victoria for our first meal after the last trip. If you're walking around St. James Bay give it a try.   Anyway, as we were hiking out and dreaming about cheeseburgers and fish tacos I said something that sums up the backpacking experience. We had spent 5 nights in tents where everything in life came down to walking, eating, sleeping, and enjoying the view. As we got closer to the end I said, "This is where the magic ends." Yes, modern life is great, but there's something amazing about the simplicity and focus of life on the trail.
This reminds me of when i went backpacking in maine on the appalachian trail this summer. such a great video!
I love the physical challenges. Honestly my favorite videos. 00:32
You guys— my knees got so weak just watching you on that fire tower! I could never…I mean I almost couldn’t watch it without feeling faint!!
I'm about to finish binge watching your 100th country playlist and thought it would be a good idea to resist watching your recent vlogs to save them for later and not wait for the whole week to see a new video. It was months ago and I didn't save a single video for the future. I just can't) You are so good! You make me so happy 💚
By far my favourite toilet tour!
Im a 53 year old woman from Toronto. I stumbled across your videos and so happy I did.... You both are pure joy, love and goodness.  Every week is like waiting for your favourite show - but better!  So happy you both exist and share your incredible journey.
Do the John Muir trail next summer!!
If that was me in the woods and the wild pigs crossed I would of turned around and said far enough. Great time camping.
Could you also make a video from a city sometimes? ☺️
Wild boar killed a lady in her subdivision driveway here in Houston. They’re incredibly dangerous.
Most beautiful~💜🌻💜
Y’all are so cute ❤ real life couple goals 😊
You guys aren't far from my house. Really nice trail area you guys chose. Have fun!
What is the name of the water purifying bottle?
Black bears are only really dangerous if see cubs. Then stay far away. Mom won’t be nice
Awesome
Me and my husband just watched you guys for the first time and we loved it. Cant wait to watch videos 😊
what a joyful and relaxing video! I listen to AT podcasts a lot (hiking radio network; recommended) and I've seen quite a few hiking videos, but I love that you combine good cinematography with taking the time to really get a sense of place and what each day is like. it's so immersive! it's great!
I love the views from the fire tower. I did lots of camping/backpacking when I was younger in scouting and those were some of the most rewarding times, epic scenery, and being with like minded people.
REI really needs to sponsor you guys
I'm down for all your adventures, but this title irked me. You guys just got back from 6 weeks disconnected at the north pole, and time off for a wedding, and, and, and...you guys are usually so good at sharing the enjoyment and not whining about your "job" this title had me worried. Ultimately, you were your normal grateful selves, but please never lose that bc the rest of us schmoes get 2-4weeks a year of sick and vacation time IF we're lucky. With kids and debt and medical issues, all that time for me is sick leave, so I'll go vicariously with you.
So fun!!! You’ve inspired me - gonna convince my son to do a hike in the Smokies with me next!
Did he just say they need a break from having fun lol
Omg nate with a full head of curls is the cutest!
Best part of the video was you guys laughing at the end.
😒
Your lives are amazing! I love the variety of adventures you share with us. Would really like to know what type of water filter you are using?
Loved this video .. different to normal & we liked it 😊 did giggle at Nate’s hair in the flash back pictures 😂 😂
For a split second there I thought you were going to make the famous hiker-trash ramen bomb :)
Dislike
Did anyone try that green stuff advertised here? Any positive/negative feedback? just curious
Nate keeps on setting the camera then walks with Kara then goes back to get the camera
I know this trip must be long over, but, if you ever do this again, it is possible to set up a small tent inside some lean-tos. It also keeps you warmer than either the tent or lean-to alone. Also: One of those emergency blanket things that weigh like one oz. are a great addition to your backpack. It can be used instead of a tarp under your pads.  Also: Nate definitely knew who had the smelly feet–he was too much of a gentleman to say! (could tell by the look on his face as you turn away.) Happy Trails!
Ideas for future episodes Stay at a real arctic/ antarctic research station for a week. Stay on a houseboat for a week Stay at an ice hotel Stay on a submarine for a week Stay on a Naval vessel for a week Nate, go to Army, Navy, Marine, Coast Guard, Air Force basic training for a week. Stay at a famous home from a movie or TV show. Stay at or visit a scientific animal research station Gorilla, dolphins, sea turtles, behind the scenes at an aquarium. AirBNB on the Goodyear Blimp in Ohio. Iceboat racing Ice Fishing in a cabin on a lake
You two are absolutely adorable, you make me smile.  I love your love for each other. God bless you both and keep you covered in a blanket of His  Security and Grace.
I almost passed over this one……glad I didn’t.
16:49 me being allergic to trees weeds severely allergic to grass I would be dead out there 😂😭
The wild boars will only mess with you if you mess with them.
There are mice in the shelters because people who eat in the shelters (ahem!) drop bits of food and the mice are after the food. It's best not to eat inside the shelters because of this.
Plus you not only need to be mindful of the bears, but the mountain lions and or cougars as well and the lynx and Bobcats
I backpacked from Maine to Pennsylvania when I was 14 with a group of buddies along the Appalachian and let me tell you guys the sun rise from the top of Bear Mountain ⛰ 😮 one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen!!!
Flizard I love it!!! XD
It is of little help with a knife hihi against wild boar
You need the new Apple Watch Ultra for its off grid features!!! 😎 love you two, sending loads of good vibes from Winnipeg!!! 💪
Ah, great video.
Woof! “Chipmunks are very cute, and, so are you Nate & Kara! 🐿+🐿 =❤❤
Note. In Virginia, pronounced VAHGINYAH. We say APPALATCHA.
Y'all are the best ⚜️
I think if you had gone off hiking for a semester during college you and Kara would still have ended up together.  You are both so right for each other!!!  My idea of roughing it is a hotel without air conditioning.
that’s a salamander no?
Would have been cool to get some shots of the night sky with how clear the sky is in the mountains without light pollution ❤
👍👍
Don't forget about all those walking miles from going back to pick up your cameras
I laughed so hard at flizzard. 😂😂😂
That’s funny, I was thinking it would be pretty cool to see y’all do a thru hike of the AT, and then y’all post this😂
You guys are my inspiration♥️♥️♥️
I live 30 minutes from the Smokies in NC. Always so much fun to see others enjoy the beauty of the mtns I grew up in.
Don't worry Kara, the only places I've camped were VERY commercialized, so I had no idea chapstick could attract bears! 🤣 I wouldn't survive just because idk what all the bears are attracted to
51 years ago, I spent a week hiking with my youth group on part of the Appalachian trail - some of my best memories.  Spent the night of my 17th birthday at the top and had freeze dried pineapple upside down cake to celebrate.  So glad you got to enjoy the trail too!
Hi sorry I am soooooooooooo late
Guys stop you were in my state! Please take me away from chemo and on an adventure with you! I’ve got my own camping kit!!
I thought they were taking a break from youtube
Love the idea of the gratefulness reset. You two really are beautiful souls.❤❤❤
To prevent smelly socks, use socks with merino wool.  Incredible.  Fox River socks rock it.
Great video thanks for sharing
Going off the grid with 20lbs of camera equipment videotaping ur every move. 😂😂😂 Don’t get me wrong, I love watching and that’s an amazing place, but hardly off the grid.
Y’all are so sweet to each other and I’m pretty sure that makes adventures like this even better !! ❤️💯
I was recently diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer at 25 and forced to re-imagine my whole life. You guys have inspired me for years, alone with Eamon and Bec. I hope to do more like you guys now after working my whole life so hard. Wish I knew how to get out there again though. Thanks for sharing your stories! Let’s go camping!!   Edit: OMG I just saw you were in my state! Come back to NC!
Loved this vid guys! I’ve hiked that part of the AT several times but I won’t bore you with my bear encounters (I did have a couple). This vid brought me back to my time there.
You guys should check out Miranda in the Woods. She can give you good tips for backpacking and how to make your packs lighter. Also, salamanders - not a lizard. They’re amphibians just like frogs. 😉
I love the moments that you take the time to appreciate God’s creation. Amazing! Even the boars….but more the mountains and sunrise/sunset. 😊
I have those same fears of going hungry which I don’t understand cause I have had always had plenty of food in my life and thankfully never experienced food insecurity. I think it has to do with the mood I get into when I have low blood sugar/I’m hangry.
How life my are you guys in the smokies, we'll be going there soon
If you hear or see a bear you are supposed to tell HEY BEAR loudly the sooner the better. Bears are more scared of you than you would think !
Keep up with all of your new adventures in your life
True definition of living life to the fullest..
1:54 it looks like her root is Japan
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Every time Nate put the pot on the flame without water already in it I died a little bit inside.  It will ruin your jet boil. Always water first!
I'd like to request a compilation video of nothing but Nate's giant hair.
You know you’re working too hard when Kara and Nate say they need a break!
Lekker man lekker 🇿🇦
Bear spray bear spray and make lots of noise while hiking!!!😇😇😅😅😅
I LOVE these hiking videos!!! ❤
I'm not scared of much, but that fire tower literally kept making my stomach drop. Yall are brave! I hate heights. Beautiful video.
It’s like that here in the Pacific Northwest! Very warm still for October, not used to wearing my shorts and tank top this time of year. Thanks for sharing your off grid experience.
I think we can all agree, you guys live an amazing life.
Looks a lovely place 🙂
I don't think I could go off grid! Power to you both for doing so because I couldn't do it.
Hope y’all brought bear bangers/Spray
Who knew that Kara and Nate would become quiet nature seekers when everyone else became travelers.
"oh i can smell my feet" something i never needed to hear from kara
wow, what a sunset & double wow what hairdo...go Nate! 😁
Love the adventure thanks for sharing ☕️ ☕️ ☕️ ☕️ 👏🏽👏🏽💪🏾💪🏾👍👍👍👍🥰❤️🏕⛺️
A "Flizzard" -Kara  hahaha.
Nate: I have coffee, waffel, Kara... Kara: Im third... 😅 Hope that you are still on the list when you are retired. 😉
If Kara and Nate were on TV they wld already have 4 Emmys🏆- tucked away in their Vanlife tool drawer 😅
I love this!
😂😂😂😂😂 a flissard!!!!!! I am 😂😂😂😂
I think 🤔 Nate is in his natural habitat!! the world is crazy like always was !!everyone should run to the hills and stay away of this sick human made world .
You guys were so cute together in college! I can't believe it😍 You guys are perfect for each other. You've inspired me to do so many thing I would've never thought I would EVER do!
Those trail meals make me constipated 😢
Loved this ❤ true nature is so glorious
Hahahahaha that voice 😂😂 .. I love Nate’s physical challenges.. you go Nate!!
Nate's bear voice. 🤣
More advice for camping. You don’t want to be quiet in the woods. Always be loud talk loudly and make some noise. That way the critters hear you before you hear them and stay away.
MORE PLS!! ( HOLLIE I MISS AND LOVE U STILL COME BACK TO ME!)
Wild pigs won't harm you unless you corner them but bears will EAT YOU as you shoot them and can run a lot faster than a human especially uphill.  You should carry bear spray gel, it works on human predators and aggressive dogs too and no blow back like with the pepper sprays. $10-20 at any gun shop.  Actually more people are killed by elk.  Me sleeping in a tent where bears are "David, get up, there's a bear outside!" He gets up and I make him show me it's just a raccoon. Fifteen minutes later, same thing.  All night long.  Lol. You guys are awesome!
Never heard a more worse idea than dropping out of school to go for a hike🥴 thank goodness he made the right choice
Is it possible, that you share your packing list for this trip? I'm asking myself to do a trip like this after my A-Levels.
Kara and nate KARAing(caring) about NATEure(nature)
Thanks guys! I needed this today! I’m a 24/7 caregiver, taking care of a elderly total care palliative care patient & we are having challenges lately. I do get some free moments to rest, spending part of it on your hike today on the Appalachian Trail has been great! Yes I appreciate all the luxuries we often take for granted.,as well. YES safe hot & cold water, electricity enabling us to have heat & AC & washer & dryer & coffee maker and all his medical equipment, a bed I don’t have to pump up , SCREENED WINDOWS, are LUXURIOUS LUXURIES!! Oh my job is thrice as hard if the power goes out. Grateful daily!!!
Instant potatoes and only food with boiling water..... what an evolution from the trans siberian
Y'all can tell y'all didn't sleep good. Y'all look so tired and fed up with mice etc....but fun video ❤ y'all be careful. My husband ran into 10 boars when he went for a run. He got so scared he ran along the highway coming home. He stopped running trails.
Your videos always make me laugh. I love watching you two on your adventures.
Surprise they did the AT instead of the CDT in Colorado.
Outstanding from beginning to end! Stunning sunrise and wonderful laughter together in your tent before sleeping 😊 I love it! Looking forward to part 2!!
Awesome
Omg I love hiking we live in Montana we LOVE to hike to frozen water falls!!!!!!
Following you...Sasquash😲🥴😵‍💫🤷‍♀️Lot's of people have experienced what you did. JS.
Nate, bring back the curls!
Guys put baking soda in ur shoes and change socks midday can use baking soda in socks
👍Kara👍 Adventure-to-Date!   When Hiking, backpacking  or dusk car driving (windows open) play load hard Rock or heavy Metal Music 🎶 🎵.   Why??  Advance warning ⚠️  to any animals you are in advance approaching  (driving -deers, ELK etc), wild boar,  bears 🐻,  skunks  etc.  They get scared away from the terrible loud sounds.  Deers 🦌  will stop in their movement  or turn around running  from crossing on the road in front of you.  It's  been working  for over 40 + yrs so far without surprise  incidents ever happening.  It may not be anything on your Top 40 tunes, and not on their animal  hearing  frequency  list either.  (Act large & make noise concept, sounds like you are in Hugh numbers)!!!👍🧡🍂🍁👨‍🦯🦌🐾 🐻 🐗🐽🦨🦝🦔🌻
You guys are so awesome! I look forward to Waking up Saturday morning to enjoy your amazing adventures. If only I was 30 years younger I would try to tag along lol
sorry but at 16:23 kara looked like she was carrying a NEW !!!!!!!!! bottle of coke
The kara and Nate notification is here 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🫡🫡
I don't like heights and just watching you two sit and eat on that tower made my stomach flip. I think that's a real first for me.
So do both of you wear Ons shoes? Or just you Nate ? How do you like them?
Did she call it a “flizzard” or a “blizzard”? Reminds me of my 2 ur old niece who wanted to try my candy blizzard from the ice cream shop and then excitedly to her mother “mommy mommy! I had lizard!” My sister looked at me with shock like “I leave you alone with my child and this happens?!?!” I explained it was an ice cream BLIZZARD!
I know y’all are super go getters, but pad the amount of time you need on the trip so you can slow down at times.  The scheduled things make me sad that you have to rush through something so beautiful.  But I love you guys.  Just want y’all to slow down a bit.
“Not another one of Nate’s physical challenge videos” the squeaky voice was hilarious 😂😂 ❤
Not 10, 000 feet..but still cool.
Votes for a sequel of Nate's awesome hairstyle ☝️
Y’all went from luxury travel vlogs to roughin it in the woods!! Crazy what a year or two will do!   Kara .. You’re doing great sweetie!!!
💜💝💕
oh my God,no nice poop toxic!!!! don't touch, don't breathe.hazmat situation,not kidding I had to deal in my house where they ate through every box in my garage and all my stuff since kid I was saving. horrible,careful seriously
Love your travel adventures Nate & Kara is a great support
This video was literally so beautiful 🥰 I am pretty sure you can choose a better moment as the thumbnail to really capture the essence of it
Study dr dale bredesen work
Hitting your head saying.....OUCH  I did it again made me laugh.  How many times have we say we won't do that again and we do it again.    Where those glass jars of peanut butter?   Looking so forward to Part 2
oh my god 4:03 the sound is from the potato war 3 by Technoblade. RIP king
what if  its  big  foot ???? the  thing in the  woods
Wondering what Kara and Nate majored in when they went to college?  Wondering if Kara and/or Nate will answer me?  Wondering if one of the over three million subscribers would know the answer?  Just wondering.....
Get a 3/4 length sleeping pad to save weight. I didn’t notice a difference sleeping when I switched.
I most likely would have crapped my pants at the wild boar sighting and left!!  I love nature 💚
A flizard🦎❤️❤️❤️.... Kara cracks me up. Love your videos
top 400 let's go
This was so calming to watch
What does AG1 even taste like
Y’all should hike the Grand Canyon. 😁🏜
Aw that's where we go. We live in north florida and drive to camp and hike in cades cove. Go if you can. It's magical..
You guys should collab with Yes theory
The laugh/kiss at the end was the best! 😃
If you encounter a wild boar... Your going to need more than a knife. They are extremely dangerous.
I had the privilege of growing up a block away from part of the city that a lumberman with foresight thought to keep Natural! Its a woods that runs along a creek; big trees, deer, Turkey, nettles, poison Ivy, leaches, all encompassing youth experience! We enjoyed playing in the woods almost daily ! Wish everyone could be so fortunate. Read the book A Walk in The Woods by Bill Bryson! Wonderful book ! Great read!! All about the Appalachian Trail!
Thank You so much… I needed a laughter and filled with wonder…good vibrations moment today.  Always a pleasure.
I love Nate’s physical Challenge
Did you guys get a late start because Kara couldn't get out of bed until Nate gave her coffee?
Bear spray the pigs.
Learn about wild foraging and breatharian
It would be amazing to see you guys attempt to do the entire trail, but I understand that you two are more into traveling, who knows? Maybe someday it's something you might want to do, if so, I'm here for it!
When are you releasing the “Flizzard” T-shirts??  lol
Great point about resetting gratefulness.
Thanks for this video, particularly the B roll images of leaves, branches, sunrise and sunset!
Snakes
not another one of nates physical challenge videos!!!
I think wild hogs would be worse than bears.
Good thing you guys are still very much in love, with those close quarters. You guys were crazy climbing up in that tall death trap. Lol. I think you guys were getting delirious by the end of this video. Lol.
This was so enjoyable to watch! I love going on nature hikes in the woods on clearly marked trails and always thought I'd enjoy longer hikes, but I can't carry anything heavy without triggering my asthma. I'd need a mule companion, lol.
Loved this video! A part of me misses watching Kara try new foods in foreign places while Nate tries to figure out travel plans last minute lol but I love all your content. I’ve gone back and rewatched the 100 countries series a few times now. Just do what makes you happy 😊 ❤️
👍🏻💙⛺️🥾🌳🌲🏕
You have to come to Norway again and go hiking! Very good system all over the country!
I’ll be so so happy if you ever do a giveaway of the freaking tiny cylinder😅
This made my day! Especially because next wk we are moving to Tennessee and I can't wait to get out in the nature ❤❤ we'll be living close to Cades cove and not to far from Gatlinburg ❤❤ thanks for yalls hard work and sharing such inspiring beaty with us!!!!
Love me some Nate & Kara. Hey Boo-boo bear! You are so brave!! Did you bring the bear spray??
I love all your content! So good! Wish you posted more often
IS THIS STILL CANADA 😊😊
I mix, my husband wants his food separated.
That look out tower is a death trap. Got a little sweaty there as you walked up. All the best guys. U.K
The Tim Tracker is not Media !!
AG1!  Allows you to hike seven miles a day on p’nut butter and choc. chip wraps!   Such a nice time this was, our hike to the fire tower. ;-). Thanks for doing the hard part!  Sure wish I had the names of your camping equipment...the tent was clear, but the water bottle/ filter? And the boil machine camping stove, the JetBoil...awesome!  Many of us want to know and will purchase!  Screen shot this and send it with your ‘pitch letter’ (thumbs up clicks will help..;-), ;-)....) and get additional kickin’-equipment ad gigs!   AG1, the stove, the water bottle, you’ve demonstrated the tent and mat...next up: Free Burton equipment for winter!   Whoohoo!  Lol, thanks again. ❤️u and yours. Flizzards! Lol.
Epic Just one word epic
Are you doing 29029 again fav video
I just started watching you guys and I watched from the beginning. Took alot of days. I love watching you guys go place to place.
This video has taken me back to wild camping in the Adirondacks in an open lean-to and needing to hang bags from trees to keep them away from bears ❤ I wish we had set ups like this in England!!
Have you ever watched the horror movie Wrong Turn, serious horror movie vibes lol 😆
pigs don't live in mud, they are actually incredibly clean animals. they roll in mud to mark the territory and use it to protect and cool themselves from the sun as they do not have sweat glands.
Thanks for making my long weekend!!Waking up to you guys and coffee is the best way to start my Thanksgiving weekend up here in northern  B.C....you guys rock!!
These two never fail to make me smile. I always get so excited to watch their videos when they post or even an old video. ❤
Both of you should have been carrying firearms for the truly unexpected. A knife  just wouldn't cut it. There's your next adventure, identifying your target, learning to shoot straight and well.
I am trying to figure out why the chapstick had to get put away, what about the chapstick on your lips?🤔😅
I thru-hiked the AT this year and I stayed in that exact shelter! Been watching you two for years...though I am still disappointed you haven't explored Ohio yet =(
I just finished watching a teenage girl hike the whole AT by herself. Chloe/Whisper. Girl was fearless. Watching y'all cracked me up.
I really hope they have a firearm with them.
I discovered you about 2 months ago and decided to go back to your 1st vlog. I'm up to around 275 right now and I'm enjoying it. You can see the progression of the quality as I go continue. Love it!
i was just crying in bed and seen you posted and decided it had to get better, thank you for the great distracting & comfort ❤
You guys are soo inspiring!! I mean I just wanna goo out into toe woods right now. I love the content and I love the way you two are living your life to the fullest
Love this so much. Would love to take a couple of weeks to hike and camp but life seems to get in the way 😑
Love yalls videos! But it’s App-a-la-CH-ian. When you say cheese you don’t say sheese. It’s the ch sound not the sh sound!
💖
We live in East Texas on 25 acres and remove pigs often. They are extremely dangerous.
Let's not just dash over nate's hairstyle in the picture at 14:08
bring back the curls, Nate!! :D
I love the fact that you 2 are so in love.  I wish I had a man love me as much as Nate loves you kara! Treat him good. I wish I had a man to love me enoufh to make me coffee. Btw, you two are brave for staying in the woods.
i like nates challenges
The whole bear 🐻 things just scares me
I would love to see you two with Emmon and Bec do the whole trail next year like Bill Bryson did and you can read it or listen to it with the "A walk in the Woods".  It was an amazing read but your videos are better still.  At least you know one section of the trail so if you do it again you will know what to bring and what you can leave behind...or have a support car meet you at certain areas to change batteries or SD cards/cameras.
What happen in the other aventure in Canada 🇨🇦!??
best part of the whole video was Kara going "third."    🤣🤣🤣
Great Adventure!  mahalo nui / thanks a lot!! .......  that tower 😬😬😬😬😬
the Appalachian trail? Have you heard what locals have talked about seeing and hearing?
This was worth the wait.  Sorry I ever doubted you
I loved seeing this GSM adventure. I have hiked 300 miles in the park mostly in winter. We stayed at Cosby knob when it was covered in snow an 20F. The mice - just feed them in the fireplace area to keep them busy. Any clothes or backpacks in the shelter unzip or the mice will chew them open.
You all think us Aussies have scary stuff in the bush/forest.. id take snakes, spiders etc over Bears and Moose. .. nope
. I was born in Tennessee, and spent some time in the Smoky Mountains...always so lovely.Thank you for sharing your adventure here. I loved seeing them again.
i cant express how much i love you guys
PLEAAAAASE stop filming the insides of toilets. It's nauseating.
Weird is good...so nice to see bloopers...so much more natural...love it
Just got home from Gatlinburg trip with the family for Fall Break! So glad to see a Smoky Mountain video!❤️🤗
Just watched all your travel vlogs from the start, you two are so funny. PLEASE bring back the food tours... loved them so much 🍽🍦🥮🍜🍝
That last scene with the kissing hahahahahahahahaha
Any other keen eyed VIPs here? 😂
9:38 “HEY BEAR…. HEY BEAR” I laughed so hard 😂😂😂
You guys should do a crossover with the Adventure Archives guys! I bet Nate and Robby would get along great!
I thought I came across a old video I didn’t watch with is vey rare but it a new one can’t wait to watch it
Thank you❤️ I really needed this🥰
Love it!!!
My husband works in a strip mine in Alabama. They’re obviously surrounded by lots of woods and thick brush. They come across wild boars quite a bit and let me tell you THEY ARE SENT FROM SATAN HIMSELF to torture us 😭 they’re so mean.
That old picture of Nate with big curly hair was something different😭
you would walk with a stick. I'm scared of snakes.
My husband & I always thought it would be awesome to hike the Appalachian trail, but never did. We are now too old but love experiencing through your travels. Love you guys.
Hey if it's stalking it could be a big cat. You guys be careful. Don't turn your back, they love exposed necks. They subdue their prey quickly that way.
This is giving magical happy fall vibes! Thanks for sharing the natural beauty and laughs <3
I would camp out on that tower
21:10 y’all are BOLD for going up there. That tower looks terrifying!! 😮🎉 thanks for another amazing video you guys!!
Early
you guys gotta make some noise while hiking
I literally have a painting in my living room of minute 1:15/1:16. I thought it was just painted but maybe it was inspired by this! I live in Arkansas by the way 😅
I was in a wild life zoo in the midwest somewhere when I was like 15 and I stopped to look at this enclosure which was just these wood log fence enclosing all these wild boars and i was looking at this group of boars about more then a football field away from when all of a sudden one of the wild boars looked up and started charging the fence right where I was standing I was taken aback and thought he would stop long before he got to the fence NOPE and rammed his horned face right into the log fence with such force I was like okay I can take a hint and walked away ... there were lots of other people standing at that fence but he came right at me
Salamander is a salamander.  Kara: Flizzard.
You are both so lucky to have found soulmate in each other. That's why it's so easy to go wild together and to do whatever you wish. Keep doing it guys and good luck.
27:32
I love PB & coco chip wrap ups   Great video
Whenever I hike with my boyfriend I'm scared of the bears too lol even in winter I act so paranoid
Y'all will be passing through my town ❤️ enjoy the trail, it's an amazing journey
I way more than you and I’m ten😢
Wow that sunrise was so amazing. Clouds were looking like a sea
Have you considered doing the west coast trail?
I love❤ watching @karaandnate ever since ......i love you guys a lot, watching you guys' videos inspires me into traveling, 🌎especially @kara she's so excited and got all this energy about everything and anything ☺
Pretty country
I’m not kidding your my favorite YouTubers and I’m 12 year old boy
Haters gonna hate. I love all of your videos. I even love the cheesey sponsorship breaks. I love that you guys share your lives on YouTube and that you go do fun cool stuff. It's aspirational.
there’s no way he edited this in the woods in the presence or bears
Salamander, aka Flizard
It’s like watching my fav sitcom. I sometimes save them and wait until the perfect moment when I can watch uninterrupted 😂. Thanks for keeping us entertained!
Wow love the impromptu van life appearance!
Go to 14:08 and see the glory of Nate‘s hair!!!
Love the 80's hair with the headband back in college, Nate!
I love your videos! Just a piece of advise so your coffee can taste much much better: don’t use boiling water, try to find the temperature when it’s hot before boiling. That way, coffee doesn’t burn 😊
You guys rock!!! You make everything look so fun. Me being a person that loves the outdoors and traveling, your channel and the adventures are right up my ally.
Pretty please no more woodsy/extreme challenges (Nate) TRAVELLLLLL!
i will keep saying it, just go shrooming, you spend so much time around mushrooms but dont look for them it's a shame.
That would be a neat hike to be on, but the the wild hogs would keep me away from there.  Just glad you both are having a great time 😚.
Love this. Thanks for sharing. God Bless.
SPRINGFIELD BEAR PATROL!!! 😼
My family just returned from camping and hiking in the Smoky Mountains last week. We were probably there around the same time as you guys. Such a great time! Our trip looked a little different. We are a family of six with four kids ages 2-10. Our most challenging (and rewarding) hike was 4.3 miles. I carried the toddler the whole way but left my water and other supplies for my husband to carry in his backpack.
If you were disconnecting why were you filming
Great video. We are enjoying all your experiences and trials. I don't think I'd sleep in a tent but that tower would be an inviting sleeping place. Especially to stay away from the wild pigs and I know the bears are stupid enough to climb up the small steps of the tower.
Loved this video.♥️
Wear fully wool socks to keep the smell at bay.
May I suggest you try the Laurel Highlands in Pennsylvania?
make noise while you are hiking . Bears are not interested in meeting humans but if you stumble upon each other well bears can be cranky specially momma bear with cubs... I sing really badly while walking in the woods or quote Shakespeare really loudly ... Only animal that will hunt a human is the cat family mountain lion  and maybe grizzlies . Black bears not so much
I freakin’ LOVE y’all’s life!! The two of you are super cute, keep me laughing, and make me feel as if I’ve been on the trip with you. Please let this channel never end!!  🔥♥️💪🏻🌸🫶🏻
Y’all definitely need a gun instead of a knife an mace
Wait, I'm stuck on the whole Bec being pregnant! Since when did they have a baby? Did I miss something 🤔 😳
Such a great video. Maybe your best video yet. Great Smokey Mountains is on my bucket list. Which season would recommend going there? Been thinking about going in the fall, but the summer looks amazing too.
Hi
Hi
Even if decisions don’t  turn out to be as planned, just got to make the most of the moments of your life. Living the moments in your life is about experiences➡️live and learn about the growth in our life.
I just love your energy and mindset. Keep it up. BR from Germany
Omg I sware I saw you guys, I just went to the smoky mountains!
Awesome adventure. This song came to mind when you were up the tower...."Appalachian sunrise meets my skin." 🌅 ❤️
We were literally in Cosby backpacking that same day. I swear we were looking for you! lol
Lol I laughed thru so much of this but the ending is by far my favorite. It's funny the things you realize about each other after being together for so long. Things you cant even explain but you just know lol. Like Nate realizing you inhale before kissing him 🤣 he didnt even realize at first that that's how he knew until he thought about it. But I feel like theres so many things like that when you're together for so long lol. It's great! Cant wait for the next video!!
I knew this shelter looked familiar. I remember it from Elsa Rhaes video :) Looks like an awesome trip!
Good for you, bye Nate <3
Great vlog as always! I love nature, but from a distance. I am more of the North Pole cruise kind of guy. Just sayin` Keep on trekkin` be safe! No bears. I watch Mountain men! Love it!
Maybe Kara’s turn to be pregnant on the Appalachian Trail? ☺️😉
Can’t wait to see part two. Any way wish you all. All the best.
I would have opted to sleep in a sleeping bag  in the 'overlook Fire place"
Now you are having some real fun times - thanks for this video.
Just curious.  What do you guys have in your packs as far as serious medical supplies I.E. more than a first aid kit.  Things like tourniquets, wound packing gauze, pressure bandages.  Life saving equipment > bandaids..   Medical Gear Outfitters is a great source.  I love everything they carry.    Be safe.  Love the videos
the way Nate said Appalachian, ouch to my heart
it makes me so happy that you guys make so many core memories with each other in some of the most beautiful places i've ever seen! you guys always manage to put a smile on my face every time you post! i love you guys so much! 🤍
… I miss your old videos when you guys focused on traveling and not on this challenges again. It’s getting old.
I love the clouds rolling over the hills like waves
You all are absolutely the cutest/awesome couple ever ❤
Kara and Nate enjoying nature again very nice cool seeing Nates back in the day pictures love the hair . nice vlog guys
Well I think it's a nice balance of high and low options of travel and adventures.
i love the survival videos
Love this video. I work at the Canadian version of REI, it’s awesome seeing you two get outside and using all the great gear. Keep inspiring! ♥️
15:33 - PUMBAA!!!
You guys should totally try out for the amazing race!
as you got coffee for kara you are all good
I cant imagine how much time it mùst take to put the camera down, then go back, walk into view and go and get camera again. Thank you for making great content. (Lol, i wrote this before Kara showed her getting the camera :D)
My parents and grandparents live in the Smoky Mountains. There’s no where quite like it!
Y'all do it all, from 5 days back packing to Arctic expeditions.  I did much of your first day hike in 1987!  We went from Cosby Campground up to Mt Cammerer and back.  ~ 11 miles.  But most I've ever backpacked is 1 night with only about 2 miles each day.
"A Flizzard!"  🤣🤣😂
While in the Army and on overnight duty on a cot  in a metal box for shelter I awoke to find a rat on my shoulder biting hunks our of my hair for a nest. Lots of fun, right? I'm very happy that happened only once!
Fighting covid for the 2nd time and nothing makes me feel better the kara and nate video
This honestly is the funniest thing to watch right now 😂 I just finished hiking the pacific crest trail and it is just hilarious seeing how unprepared and inexperienced you guys are hiking like this, I made many similar mistakes when I first started hiking 😅
the time you take to set up every shot is just so cool.....thanks kids.
So beautiful
I’m retired.  I don’t have all that much. But I am totally grateful that I’m so comfortable & blessed every day.  Loved the waterfalls & streams but I would never do this hiking. Nate u need a gun. The world is to unsafe right now.
shoutout from MAINE!
Seeing the view from the lookout tower has been the highlight of my day so far. Absolutely incredible! Thank you, Kara and Nate! 🌻
my two fav people - loved the vlog and the adventures and the laughs :)
Wait some people don't like your adventures? Don't watch then lol. I absolutely love it. I've had health issues after having a motorcycle accident when i lived in Massachusetts. I adore these videos, makes me wish I could be as active as i used to be. God bless you both, can't wait to see the next episode :).
Weirder and weirder is great for entertainment lol
My legs were shaking when you were in the tower and I was sitting in my chair!
That tower was making my legs shake!!
OMG!!! It never fails. I am going around doing my Saturday morning chores and then it happens. A Kara and Nate video drops and everything comes to a stop. My poor husband's like, where did you do? I yell back, Kara and Nate just dropped their video!  Lol. And can I just bring up Nate's college hair!!! OH EM GEE! I can't! Hahahah. The hair game is epic. Honestly, I love watching the nature trips, but I WILL NEVER do it. Nope. No way. No maam.  Too many creatures and critters. No. No. No. So I watch and admire magnificent beauty that is out there from the safety of my apartmenr. So for that, thank you for taking us a long. Can't wait for part 2! Oh, and I am committing before I even watch. I AM GOING TO LOVE PART 2! So thank you Kara. ❣
Nate- “I got coffee, waffle and Kara.”  Kara- “Third.” LOLL
Nate, I hope you brought 2 jars of peanut butter.
you guys are the best you always make the best content and always make my day by making those great videos <3
love living vicariously through y’all. i would love to do this but also don’t know if i’d survive  LOL. thanks for another great vid 😄
You guys can do it  I believe in you
THE EPIC COUPLE IS BACK AT IT ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I have been watching since the 100th county, you guys have come so far.
I love you guys! And I've never even met you. God bless you both, thank you.
I would never  go there!
I'm at that tower part and my palms are so sweaty it's ridiculous. 😱😬
i knew if y’all were going in the woods to watch out for bears and especially in the Appalachian mtn range to not look into the trees or whistle at night..
Whenever I see you eating mashed potatoes I think of you all on the train in Russia.
hi
Just what I needed kara and nate video
That tower wouldn’t be for me. Getting nauseous just looking at you guys being up there.
Yeah best thing you can do, be loud. If you think a bear is near by, getting quiet n waiting around is the worst thing you can  do. Be loud, make it known you are there and keep close to make yourself look big if it does happen to walk  up to you
Gratitude = happy
I always love your videos but being somewhat of a hiker/backpacker myself I enjoy this even more! Also, wild hogs can be really scary! I've learned that if being attacked you should stand in from of a tree and jump to the side as they charge at you. Not sure if I'd have the situational awareness to do that tho 😂
I love ur guys videos been watching for years ❤
On  the  Trials like  this one you might run  into a bigfoot or a dogman
I like your physical challenge videos. I'd love to see you do the full 480 miles  of the Camino de Santiago. It's hard but Kara would definitely not go hungry 😂
greatful reset? more like ZOMBIE reset !!
Another amazing video
Sorry but the fire tower I couldn't stop thinking of wrong turn!!
♥ ♥ ♥
Love all the adventures you all go on 🥰
Very Bloar Witchy there for a minute. and Flizardy too
Hello 👋 Kara and Nate
Love you
when are you visiting puerto rico again
But this is more stable!
When they claimed the later  thing for the sat alight, all I was thinking was omg the movie. The fall when they fell off of the later snd the girl died and the later broke  .
“Not another one of Nate’s physical challenge videos” 😂😂😂
I think you purchased a one person tent
You guys crack me up.  And Kara, thank you for your honesty.  I think there are a lot of us out there like you, who enjoy the outside, but are not a crunchy hippy!
I know you have three million subscribers, but i miss the travel vlogs around the world.  This camping and living on the land gives me PTSD of being a boy scout in the 1970s where I had to do that myself.  Let's see places. And affordable.  Living on a luxury solar powered yacht does not count.
You do realize that once Kara put ON the chapstick in the tent, the scent was there and putting it in the bear bag at that point didn’t matter?  If you have to use chapstick while backpacking don’t put more on after about 1-2 pm
omg, 39 minutes ago  ❤️
More power to y’all
Bring back the curly hair Nate!
Kissing with bad breath 🤮🤮
Loved this!!
Was so expecting Jason to jump out of the woods at anytime
I love the high school pictures!
When you guys went to get water the second day you need bear spray and when you are hiking have it out. Bears don’t wait for you to get you bear spray out 😅
Most relaxing video I've seen from you. I felt like I was in nature with you and loved it!
At 9:40 I would have given my right arm to jump out of the bushes and yell!😜🤣 Sorry, just sayin.
I have “some” bass in my voice!
Man yalls videos always brings comfort for me
The sunrise looked so amazing from the fire tower. This is the ultimate hiking trip 🤩
Watching this at work on this beautiful sunny October day living vicariously through you, imaging the sweet smell of the pines 👃
naatttuuuurrreeee
I absolutely love Tennessee! it's absolutely gorgeous there. Plus Kara keeps making me laugh
y'all are literally so in love, and I love to see it. Go you guys!
"Flizard"  🤣🥰😊 Please note,I did take away more than just that.
So if the scent of chapstick can attract bears, and Kara put some on her lips....😳
Not me getting my snacks to get comfy to watch Kara and Nate hike 30 miles lol
I have said this multiple times but I'm saying it again, really appreciate it when you guys convert the miles, pounds, currency and other things to the metrics system and euro!!!!! Thank you
I thought also that food will be my biggest issue, I hiked 3 days in the Swedish forests on the High Coast. And then, I hardly ate something, came back with half my rations... that's when I realized for some reason, if Im moving and exhausting myself way more than normal, my hunger disappears, and I can go a day without food. Not the best idea though, and sure I forced myself to eat, but couldnt eat as much as I thought I would.
Aww! Long, curly-haired Nate!
This was the fastest I have ever clicked on a video. Want to go backpacking so badly. Good for you two. Living the DREAMMMM
I love the physical challenge videos!! And I love this one too 🥰
Love this. I just want to say… Please remember to hang your food in approved Bear bags/bear totes. And never cook food where you’re sleeping. Especially in the Smokey mountains. That’s how attacks happen.
You guys should try ultralight backpacking next time!
KARA'S WEARING A MOUSE POOP TANK TOP!!!!!
I don’t mind the physical challenge variety - but this summer has been lots of woods survival videos. Love you two! Don’t care to start a fire any time soon. 🤍
Seriously…city people don’t go out in the mountains…YALL have noooooo clue what ur in for or how to defend URSELF. Get a gun, get a carry permit, practice…then go in backcountry…..going out there like this is dangerous
What is the purpose of the fire tower? is it to lookout for fires or escape from them?
Nothing like being in the woods especially when you’re in the smoky mountains making memories
Im loving this outdoor survival series. Idk if I can call it a series… but It looks so much fun! Makes me wanna run miles to the nearest jungle and survive. 😂 any tips? 😂
Love you guys!!! Thank you for eevery upload ❤️❤️
what?  have you NOT watched at least one episode of “the walking dead”. aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh😮😬😳☠️
Nate, you have the time and ability do the whole trail now or in the next year or so
hi
This made my day so much better  I am so inspired by what you guys do I love y’all so much❤️
early ! 30 mins ago, ok im done great vid btw
I will choose my tent over sleeping in a shelter with snoring, farting strangers any day 😂😂. Also, time for me to get a jetboil. That thing looks powerful!
I actually love all of Nate’s physical challenge lol wish my bf and I could also do it too !
very quick compliment to the editing :) awesome job, as always! I especially love the fact that you always include distances in km and weights in kg or temperatures in degree celcius 😊 as a european, this makes everything just much more relatable and more easy to watch without doing the maths 😂 Have a safe trip! Love from Germany ❤
Omg, it’s giving  firewatch if you know the game❤🔥
Bring back the long curly hair Nate.
Walk with confidence it's all about your vibe and stance while walking animals can tell if your timid or confident they usually back down when you come stomping through
Last i saw you were with Eamon and Beck🙈When did you leave them?💕💖💕
I’m home from school for fall break and my mom just made me breakfast and now I’m watching a new kara and Nate video????? Best day ever
finally new upload video been waiting this
This video unlocked a core memory! I grew up visiting Cosby and this is the trail I used to hike. I carved my name in that shelter when I was 5 years old. 😊
I would LOVE to see you guys hike the AT!!!!!! Y’all would crush it! ❤❤❤
Awesome!!! I love this kinda stuff!!!!!!
Love seeing the early curly headed pictures 🤣 who knew!
Hiii
This is awesome! Love the Smoky mountains, and you guys are just spending 5 days there together. You two are so sweet! Excited for y’all!
I love the crazy adventures you all do! The canoe trip is my favorite! 💜💜
Just for the record I enjoy your physical challenges. I just like the diversity of your adventures in general.  Probably why I've watched so many. Thanks for everything
Stunning nature videography in this - VERY IMPRESSED with your ability to identify a good camera shot and get the sound and background to cooperate. You must have hours of video to get those shots. Impressive, I mean National Geographic quality shots!
Lol why are y’all whispering in the woods!? So funny 😂
Btw…have y’all never considered hiking Mt Leconte and staying at the Lodge? That’s a challenge and an amazing video opportunity….
HELLOOOOOOOOO I  LUV YALL!!!!!
I've read and enjoyed many books on people's treks on the Appalachian  trail and the Pacific Crest trail as well, many that have hiked most of one or the other or both. Nothing I could do but enjoyed reading about them.
I love Nate’s physical challenge videos!
Few places are as close to heaven as the Great Smoky Mountain Park! Thanks for bringing us along!
My Face Lights Up When I See Your New Post. Keep It Up!!!
I love this so much.  Love the Smokies so much.  But a saying in Appalachia i, if you hear something in the woods, no you didnt!  Lol. Love you guys!
You guys should go to eastern 🇨🇦! I just spent 3 weeks out there (Quebec) and it was very nice  Cheers from San Diego California
Thank you for always bringing happiness to our days 😊 Always
Hi
i love your videos but i miss the international travel vlogs
I love it when y’all are in my area. I look for y’all’s van whether you’re here or not though! 😂
SO HAPPY TO WATCH THIS VIDEO!!! LET GOOOO!!!
Well done guys 😊
ILYYYY SMMMMMM LESS THAN 20 MINS
6:53 I knew I recognized this shelter!😂 i have watched so many people thru hike thge Appalachian trail. Our family considered doing it together so many times! We are a family of 11 and we were very inspired by another family who did it! Their channel is called Fight For Together and you should totally watch their travel vlogs and the documentary they made at the end! I think you would really like them @karaandnate
Every time Kara and Nate posts a video it puts a big smile on my face and it makes my day! Love you guys so much! Keep up the good work guys!
Wish y’all good luck
I literally love y’all soooo much!!! I look forward to your videos every week! Your goals and amazing!
My day is always made when I watch u guys! ❤
i just like how he is saying hey bear
U GUYS ARE AMAZING!
I like your physical challenge videos!
IM EARLY! I love y'alls vlogs and videos!! :)
nice video keep going on  kara and nate
Every time a video posts me and my sister immediately watch it! It’s a great way to bond before she goes to college and we love your channel! We also love to travel and hopefully can one day do the things you do! Thank you for making my day better!❤
You guys have GOT to watch DIYWIFE latest YouTube video… they are awesome and shouted y’all out in their Q&A video as being the ONLY YouTubers they watch.  You were impactful to their success on YouTube.  I think it would be awesome if y’all did a collab with them.. they are totally your vibe - except with kids.  Maybe swap places - let them live van life and y’all care for FOUR kids for 24 hours.  Now there’s an adventure!! LOL. Check them out!
I love this channel
Another great adventure! Do you have a preference for beach/ocean verse forest when it comes to these kinds of experiences?
Relaxing my ass 😂 I love it!
It looks like Pennsylvania and New York state wilderness.
Loveeeeeeeee your videos!!!!!!!!!!! You have no idea how much ❤️💕💕💖
Let’s go I’m early
i have just been loving all the survival videos you have been releasing. So exciting :D
Mistaya lodge would be a great place if you need an adventure
I love your phisycle challenges
thounk you so much for a great video!
To live into your own retirement and have a great time, it’s true to travel, visit an even more amazing!  Thank you for your support!
Early
Wow I have never hiked or camped in the wood for days at a time. Your experience looked great so now I will gather some friends and try my luck haha. Thanx Kara and Nate!!
Wait a minute I thought you guys gave the van away to one of your guys parents
Heck if there was a bear warning I’d be running with my tail tucked BAHA. Kudos to y’all
15kg pack without the camera gear?  My man... You need to drop some weight. 30% would be simple. 50% would cost some money. 70% will take some comfort sacrifices.
Yes I needed a new video today! My dad is coming home on hospice from the hospital and I've been so stressed. Love I can zone out on a kara and Nate video for a bit ♥️ I can't wait to see the vids of y'all with Riley and elayna
Adventure is out there. Let's all try to have fun and explore our country wherever we live. Trust me you will learn new things and have amazing memories.
Wow... Applachian trail is probably the most beautiful hiking trail in the world and more importantly the way it is managed by all the local councils.
The smoky mountains are one of my very favorite places in the world. I love when you guys do these random survival challenges lol! ❤
I love watching your videos but I think you should post more videos,  please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Very beautiful
