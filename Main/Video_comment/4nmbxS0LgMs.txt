Dear RobTop,   I got a bug that is shocking.   When I was grinding for moons I got a color "Yeah, Platformer is my thing"  While it says you need 6000 moons, I have 425 moons.   How did this happen?   Maybe it was a reward for participating in the 2023 rewards?    or It was moon bypass?   When I checked the achievement, I did not unlock it yet.    RobTop pls fix this.    Thanks!
oh robot! The wave is tilted at 44.9 degrees, making me very uncomfortable 😢
I LOVE GD COLOGNE
Awesome to robtop to more

xd
So unfair for GuitarHeroStyles… falsely accused and because of that he's now being excluded from all this kind of stuff when he is one of the biggest content creators of this decadent game…
Popo robtop i did the middle fingure

9:25 c'mon RobTop, why didn't you pick Acheron instead of MINUSdry? Not complaining or anything, just saying that Acheron would've been a better option Edit: OPINION ALERT!!!!!!!!! Also, cant wait to see KOCMOC Unleashed be picked best extreme of 2024, like, i don't think anyone is gonna make a better level than KOCMOC Unleahed!

Nicee
🗣️🗣️rubirubi chan onegai rate TIDEL WAFE FR!!
7:05
Ах, да
I'm not a member but I think this idea can help you. In order not to prolong the wait for updates, you could use the snapshot technique, that is, put 5 or 10 things from the next Update so people find errors that you can solve and it will also make people not leave GD I wrote GD because that's what we call Geometry dash in Mexico In addition to not leaving Geometry Dash without people, people will stop saying that Robtop doesn't know what to do with the job. If you have good ideas, answer or hit the comment ❤️
Hey RobTop, Will there be a snake mode in update 2.3?
Aja y nexus? Y guitar?
😢😢😢😢

I seriously want him to reupload this with the Congregation jumpscare at the end lol

Your favorite Geometry Dash Levels/Streamers/Players/Creators/YouTubers/Videos may have not won The Geometry Dash 2023 Awards, but this is only the beginning...
WHOO HOO
These are insane how are people so talented at making and playing levels holy. I could never beat even an easy demon but I still love these levels. I haven't even beaten all stages in the main game. I beat one yesterday tho after years of trying lol I'm bad but I get better with time. I love a finger dash and I'm at the very end of that level.
Zoink yooo congrats for the win
And 🎸?

7:26 QUE ROBADA, QUE ROBADAAAA

Что музыка взятая у Дениса Карамышева забыла в этом видео?
Fucking tidal wave in the video? Rate it bruh
this is so nostalgic, gg guys, gg
Gd colon *tried* to use paint (I guess) to edit it to say *correct info ℹ️  like that he has 600K subs and that he’s Canadian and he’s not the best artist* so *yeah*
WHAT is such a legendary level and deserved taking home the award for best hard level. And for insane y’all should know about swagger’s secret. And Mulpan got robbed of best youtuber.
Robtop give me moteratro please (soy español
the fact that tidal wave was in the end of the vid and still isnt rated💀
Hello robtop give me moterator
the fact Colon beat out EVW for the best youtuber is absolute treason
BEST LOBOTOMY FOR 2024
Pls Free Geometry Dash
I am so glad that npesta won that one. He is one of the best YouTubers and Streamers in the GD community, being so real and funny.
RobTop plz rate my levels! Account name: GDEndie
Fire in the hole!
why is the best youtuber not evw
The glow from the icon at the end of the montage didn't leave the screen entirely. This deeply upsets me and traumatizes me and I wish that I never saw it. The eyes could have gone on well, if it weren't for the horrific, terrifying glow at the bottom of the screen near the end. I cannot go on anymore, and I do not wish this torture upon anyone listening to me being an obnoxious yapper. Stay strong, as I couldn't. 🤧
Ieb
Rate tidal wave
1:21 come on. you know you want to.
Where is GuitarHeroStyles?

You people can’t deny that the 10 year anniversary video wasn’t the most hype GD video ever created. We even got the release date (even though it wasn’t true) plus that animation. Watching the premiere was so hype
Scratch, chopper
Jaja festejo y me río en la cara de iSpyYouWithMyFemboyEye

Why did they put the logo of a demon on that of an insane?
I'm so mad that he isn't adding the update to the Amazon appstore, because I have a trash amazon fire kindle, and I don't even blame him because no one knows what that is, but still. Please add it RobTop! I was so excited for 2.2 releasing, and then a few days before it did realease, I thought, "What if he doesn't add it to the Amazon appstore?" And the day came, he never added it. Pls add it!
I feel bad for Silky😢
In YouTubers where is guitarherostyles???
Where is explorers?
7:20 The Best youtuber advistyles!!!

Oye robtop puedes agregar una opcion en el juego para cambiarlo a idioma español ? , seria muy útil para millones de jugadores latinos
I feel honored that my icons were used in certain showcases of levels. (I have no idea why but im gonna take all credit)
hi robtop, is it possible to play level 2.3 explorers?, I've been waiting for it for a very long time and really want to play!
One level I wanted to be on was "3RROR" but unfortunately it is on GDPS

*insert congregation jumpscare* 13:39
"b spr9s0" should have won
i was waiting for December to appear: "and Ever", and "Logodomy"
They should make this video a geo dash level
11:59 i love mystic bounds and thought it wouldnt show up because it wasnt a nominee but here it is thank you doggie
man sikky was so close to winning best streamer award
why didnt EVW win :(
Robert Tobert really knows how to make a good game.
Dang I expected Limbo to win best extreme demon.
Where is guitarherostyles?
Absolute cinema
WHERE IS NEXUS
Afterlife is the most overrated level ever, it is not as good as people make it seem, drowned basin or dreamy should’ve won best normal
congrats to all off the nominees, winners, and I really loved the very end of some of the great levels made this year. I hope that 2024 will have better things to come!
The glazing over bli is crazy, yes he’s amazing but there are creators 10x better than him like CuLuC and he wasn’t even a nominee
Is legendary!
that background music sync with this part 1:09
great edit for 2023
YEARRRRRR🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

7:27 YOU FORGOT KINGSAMMELOTTTTTTTTTT
Samifying was robbed
Where is SEPONGE 8:45
what is the song used in the beginning>
I like that part 0:12
Just rate tidal wave!
I think the best part is the video ended with the "geometry dash" time warp in dash, one of the hottest moments of the year. Still shocked 2.2 is out ❤
When explorers?
It is a crime that Spu7nix wasn’t an option for best creator
This is insane
I love how we almost got congregation jumpscared at the end.
7:38 When was cologne American?
Thank you for using link as the first song!
2:43 magdalene got 2.2 percentage
아아… 그저… ❗️기❗️습❗️숭❗️배❗️
bli is making it out this year!!!
поч 2023
Rob pls make gd free
Hello, RobTop! I didn't find where to complain, but I decided to complain here about one player in your game with nickname newrot. He cleared 525 demons in 12 hours using a bug or cheats. Please ban him. He is my friend and I don’t like what he does because it’s not fair. Thank you in advance.
no way this guy used linked its such a good song
Yall let the femboy win best yter bruh
FIRE IN THE HOLE!!!
Sputnik is already in 2.3

I like how he included Tidal Wave even though it wasn't rated. 😂 Jokes aside, this is an amazing video, with the best editing I've seen. It's been awhile since I saw video that actually was made with time and effort. Thank you. ❤   Edit: Sorry for my bad grammar. 😅
People when they say it is just a normal mobile game va what geomarty dash actually is
Was not expecting the montage it is awesome robtop
Congrationlations to robtop for that amazing animation and wining the contest the animation must have taken a while robtop

Robtop pls add coral reef background in next bugfix update
The gd colon clip was a violation

Hey RUBBY I CANT MAKE AN ACCOUNT I DID MY EMAIL AND IT DONT WORK
Rip mulpan :(

12:40   how is tidal wave here when its not rated lol... RATE TIDAL WAVE

13:48  I was expecting a congregation jumpscare :(
I was completely expecting a congregation jumpscare at the end there
10:12 WOW NELIS WAVE
Why was I expecting a congregation jumpscare at the end there
Where is nexes
12:40 Robtop didnt just put this on accident they are all rated levels so maybe he will rate it somewhere soon
‏‪12:40‬‏  It's ironic that Tidal Wave is featured in RobTop's channel and not rated
the montage is FIRE (in the hole)
SayItBack was robbed so badly, one of the best levels in the game
13:39 Am I the only one who expected congregation jumpscare at the end😂
i wish congregation jumpscare appeared at 13:40
Nuuu sikky lost by 0.3%
robtop casually getting voted for best video
no rob why did you put gd colonge's skibidy toilet level :(
i love gd colonge
At the end, you should’ve put Best Jumpscare, because it’s congregation.

I can't wait for this video to win the best gd video next year
No way Robtop just casually gave away a free chance for Congregation Jumpscare like that 💀
13:40 honestly waiting for a cong jumpscare
robtop finally made it🗿
GD colon shouldn't have won the best youtuber award.
I don’t think it’s a good thing that I was half expecting a congregation jumpscare at the end 😢
1:21 best fire in the hole level

13:40 would be such a good Congregation jumpscare
Damn that bg music kick hard

*casually stumbling across a RobTop video*
Rontop win a Robtop Awards, XD
Bro put tidal wave in the levels of 2023 but didn’t rate it 💀
I love the video, the editing is so epic and the idea so good !
it's a shame for the rest of the levels from cherryteam
I wish i could hear the original audios per track :(
13:38 this would be the best congregation jumpscare ever
Only thing i disagree with is Gd Colon being the best youtuber.
HOW CAN YOUR PC RUN WHAT mine just can't run what it crashes
i hope in next 2024 the geometry dash awards there will be "best icon" award
How the hell is emerald realm not the best medium demon?!
2.2, nice, when 2.3
It would be cool to add all these rewards to profiles right in the game
GD COLON WON LET'S GOOOOO
Sikky losing by 0.4% makes me deppresed
Fire... in... the.... hole.. 🙂🟢

thanks Viprin and All!!!
12:38 AHA NOW MOD CAN T PRETEND THAT THEY DON T KNOW ABOUT TIDAL WAVE
These levels must be MYTHIC rerated!
"The winners of each category will receive a badge on their Geometry Dash profile in 2.21. This will also be the case for future Awards, but not past ones. Note that a maximum of one badge will be awarded per category. For individual awards, the receiver of the badge is the user in question. In categories for specific works (all level categories and Best Video), it will normally be given to the uploader of the work on the given platform. However, the badge may be transferred to another single member of the work upon request from the uploader. Whether this is accepted or not is at the discretion of RobTop. We reserve the right to remove any awarded badges due to misconduct in the community at any time." so robtop gets a badge?
Пиздец, космос проиграл
Congrats @splinter25yt for the win! I am honoured enough that they used my track for that level, thanks everyone for playing ❤️❤️
13:41 Could have been a good congregation jumpscare

Without culuc in the best creators is just sad
I love gd colonge
3:59 Change Of Scene Stole alot of attention from the other levels its good but just a bit overrated.
Hey RobTop I thought you will reveal the 2.21 release date at the end so I watched the entire video😂😂
ngl the whole community is way too based, go get ur own opinions instead of following the crowd
Zoink???
OMG sikky almost won
I'm gonna be honest bli aoverrated as I don't like his lvls very unpopular opinion but comment or like bc I wanna know who has the same opinion as me
we love GD cologne
The moment i saw the easy demon winner im not even surprised
Hummm, tidal wave IS here but still unrated,robtop wtf?
i love gd colong
Hope you have a happy new year for gd, and i also hope you get many great achivements this year(the game and the players)like me beating demons really quickly this year(10 demons so far in my career and in this year), but sikky was so close
I love music what u choise
Im gonna get free robux with this song💀
Bli and his Change of Scene level won as I anticipated. You deserve it bli. Can't wait to see what you can make this year.🎉🎉🎉
Remamber bloodbath
I honestly had a feeling that the end would be a congregation jumpscare
My colonge won😢
HE PUT TIDAL WAVE HERE BUT WONT RATE IT ??????
2023 is the most legendary year in gd history
Nooooo mulpan
I saw tidal wave at 12:40 but y u don’t rate it?
GD IS COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
when 2.21 COMES???
Wait... BLI IS DUTCH!?!? Ik ook. :)
Fire in the hole
A demon could pass in 13 minutes
when are you making explorers
Guitarherostyles is the best youtuber and he was there at the beginning
Such a robtop thing to do = make own video winner
NCS number 1
Rob dont update the game frequantly but when he do some montage ❤❤
robtop underrated creator fr
Esto es arte aprecienlo
Peanut butter
9:54 kocmoc by cherryteam
Robtop put Tidal Wave in the video but didn't rate it🤨🤔
I agree that Bli is an awesome creator but there is no way he should’ve shattered the polls like with the other nominations and how cool they looked there should’ve been at least some competition
The best auto level was made for moldys video. Thats crazy 😮
In a way, this video is inspirational, it shows how far we’ve come as the GD community and it shows us how we survived 7 years without an update, and when the *cough* fire in the hole *cough* update actually arrived, we simply had more tools at our disposal, more ways to bring our creations to life. Thank you Rob <3
why gauntlet lvls in top
I love gd cologne
Geometry dash is the best game ever 🤌🏻
I WASENT IN THE LIVE STREAM!!!
Every one : THIS VIDEO IS FIREE Me : this video should get rated
ХАХАХАХАХАА ТАМ ШОУКЕЙС ЭЙРИЛИ БВЛ
I love GD Colon
ЧЕ ТУТ НЕЛИСВЕЙВ ЗАБЫЛ АХАХАХАХ
а поч у зоинка нету тайдала
АЙММАКС ЕЕЕЕЕЕЕ
No way sikky lost by 0.3%
Me parece un poco injusto que no le hayan hecho ninguna mencion a guitar y hizo mucho por el juego y la comunidad y ni si quieran se molwntan en mencionarlo pero estuvo bueno el video
и космос тоже
Ну эмпайреан ожидаемо
Robtop, please paste Congregation jumpscare in the end 🥺
АТМОС???
ЦИТОКИНЕЗИС АХУЕТЬЬТ
Jumper copy☠️☠️☠️
Ну краш гейм ожидаемо
АТМОСФЕР НАХУЦ ПАНЯ ТЫ НАКРУТИЛ?
Someone has to put a congregation jumpscare at the end PLẞ
ЕБА НЕУР АБСЕНС НИКВЕР КРАСАВА ХОРОШ
I expected a congregation jumpscare in the end :|
The problem with Change Of Scene is that it's overrated, meaning it will win every award, which makes people think it is the best making it more popular while other demons that are good, like glorious fortress, never get a chance to win even though they are better
Zoink and HOW were predictable
colon is overrated
bloodbath for mb players: bruh me rn: 😪
Oh i forgor
13:37 we all can agree 2.2 was best possible ending of 2023 (Christmas present weeeeee)
I voted those and they actually won, wow
2:46 Magdalene got "2.2%" votes 2.2 update😮
I see a lot of support for Tidal Wave here, it's really an amazing level!
Tidal wave in the levels montage?? Surely it gets rated now.  Also Samifying got robbed that video was a masterpiece
IT'S VERY COOL!
the ending had so much potential for a congregation jumpscare....
nah bro 0.3% for sikky be like 💀6:57
Rate tidal wave
Nexus:😐🍷
13:41 I was really expecting a congregation jumpscare 💀
Videazo 🗿🥣
А ЧЁ НЕ КОСМОС ОТ РУССКИХ ИГРОКОВ!? 6:22
Best video is actually a W for Viprin, Nasgubb and other people who took part in that amazing project!
9:48 from there on the video looks like a spu7nix level
if zoink is a hacker, doggie has won best player 3 years in a row
RATE TIDAL WAVE

wait a min i thought this was 1 year ago but i was wrong
What crashed my game many times but it is amazing
Guys dont kill me purely my opinion but hear me out, ispywithmylittleeye is better than change of scene and deserves it more. Purely my opinion dont kill me
Robert Nicholas Christian Topala, you should rate tidal wave NOW
6:22 What? Bruuuuuh
0:00 3:40 7:20 name song?
RATE TIDAL WAVE

13:40 Why not add congregation jumpscare here?
Emotional video by Rubrub. I'm so happy 🥳

Its sad that we didnt even see spuntix here
way too late to this, but I wanna congratulate every single nominee for making it into the awards and I also wanna thank you all for giving me and DangerKat the opportunity to be part of an awesome event and recollection of awesome levels in 2023!  Let's hope to a cooler year of 2024 with more amazing levels :)
I  L O V E  G D  C O L O N G E
13:46 how cruel to fool us like that😭
Rob, GD Colon is asking to remove Generation Retro from the poison gauntlet. I will come up with an idea of making the level in a green and eerie way but please, everybody begs, remove Generation Retro. You did not make it but you added it. Remove it. PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
bro really excluded num. 1 extreme demon from zoink's achievements just because he refuses to rate it (how does it even matter if it's literally the hardest level)
Nice video! Now let's wait until GD Colon comments...
Robtop😃🥇🤏😃Robtop
This is great, thank you RobTop for such a cool game :)
gg
robtop, can you fix the issue where gd does not open on mac?
Robtop the type of person to win his own contest
It's a shame that the "And Ever" level didn't even make the list of the best. For me, this is a real masterpiece, and it was released in 2023.
FIRE IN THE HOLE🔥🕳️
Bet that infamous gd colon video made him much popular than he was before💀
Very happy that GD put on some cologne won.
fire in the hole!
Tidal wave rated sneakpeak? 12:40
they should have added a congregation jumpscare at the end
Congrats to Sikky, he lost by 0.3 and he thought he would be 3rd last.
All
Rate tidal wave
what. 6:20 how that piece of... may be better than empyrean and cytokinesis
bro gave himself a reward
Geometry Dash award is Best videos on YouTube. Thank you, RobTob. You give us a very good game and commynity. Thank you for everythink.
9:56 finally, this lvl was shown at least somewhere
The fact that robtop knows about skibidi toilet dash is crazy 💀
Zoink's Notable Demons Should Be Tidal Wave, Avernus And Acheron 🦵🏿🦵🏿🔥
13:40 I EXPECTED CONGREGATION JUMPSCARE HERE LMAOO
8:14 robtop won robtop's competition lol
YESSSS GD COLON WONNNNN😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
why was i expecting a congregation jumpscare right at the end
Robtop is so humble
Zoink is the best player ever

WHAT - what? 75%
1:22 Best Fire in the hole Level :)
ZOINK BEAT TIDAL WAVE.
rubrub
I will do 200 push up for everytime Bli's got an award.

Congrats gd colon🥳🥳
Nah robtop is crazy giving him is own award
ROBTOP PUT TIDAL WAVE IN LMAO First step for rated
Robtop really said “nah i’d win” 😭
I wish robtop showed the level IDs of everything at the end of the video, so many of those levels look really cool :*(
Thank you, robtop!
WHERES NEXUSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
FIRE IN THE HOLE
I like how robtop put emerald realm in the first part of the montage AND the month of June but still never rated it
Was really shocked about Cytokinesis been voted less times than just KOCMOC (and half of votes were 100% because it was by Russian team)
good
Bli wont twice TWICE in a row from the SAME award category [GD10 vid and this one]
7:47 the perfect editing again
KOCMOC NO BEST EXTREME DEMON!!!?!?!?!?!?? WHYYT
And the best "Fire in the hole" level?🗿
good
6:21 NOOO WAAAY
Congratulations to all the winners and Goodluck to everyone for this year's awards
5:48 Damn, can't believe Team Cherry won best Insane Demon, NOW GO BACK TO MAKING SILKSONG ALREADY!!!
Fire in the hole!
Leyend ∆∆∆ Michigun

Очевидный грабеж космоса. Edge of destiny не заслуживает имхо
The end wa the perfect moment for a congregation jumpscare
Someone really get fiar in da hole     cup💀
12:40 Robtop, do you even know what level this is?
so wait will you rate tidal wave?
i love gd cologne :)
I thought we would get a 2.21 or 2.3 trailer
Of course rob voted for himself. Such a rob thing to do....
4:49 oh hey easy shardscapes
I love gd cologne
maaaaan. i voted for mulpan but :(
NPESTAAAAAAAAAAA
The nostalgia music tho -
why isn't tidal wave rated?
I thought there was gonna be a congregation jumpscare
Where is nexus gd😭
W NPESTA SO DESERVED
I expected a congregation jumpscare at the end.😅
I want a heart of RubRub
8:28 why you invite yourself rob why 💀💀
this year was a great year in geometry dash history. i mean, 2.2 realeased! after 2,528 days, it actually released!
12:38 he knows...
THANK GOD EYESPY DIDNT WIN 🙏 I HATE THE POPULARITY BIAS
Where is tidal wave
i wanted it to be Sikky for calling robtop a menace
rate tidal wave
If congregation released in 2023, rob could make a congregation jumpscare in the end and get away with it
sikky be like
Change of scene is a shit
Я уже довольно давно не несу этому комьюнити практической пользы, но это комьбнити не уйдет из меня никогда
The fact that we couldn't beat robtop for best video is saying something
The fact that we couldn't beat robtop for best video is saying something
награды
🔥🕳
RobTop getting flamed for not rating Tidal Wave is the funniest shit I've seen in a while
6:20 empyrean and cyto are by far better than both eod and kockmock💀
so called free thinkers when asked what should happen to tidal wave
Robtop making videos instead of making 2.21
Perfect opportunity for a congregation jumpscare at the very end
The ending was so nice for congregation
So happy to see my collab Voltage at 11:57!! I will always be really proud of how that level turned out and it's such an honor to see our work on the official RobTop channel ❤
Хм
No culuc in creator voting?
Sikky so close nooo
Спасибо, о великий Robtop!  Вы становитесь великим человеком..
I was 100% expecting a Congregation jumpscare at the end there
But the best player is smiffy777
most strange thing is tidal wave became famous enough to appear in robtops video but it didnt rating
i love gd cologne
Water on the hill
Oh damn, this video is very cool, especially at the end the list of levels by month was very cool, I hope it will be just as cool with the next awards
Not even a 3d level can make it
robtop why did you change the wave it's not convenient
GD10 is one of the most monumental videos that the community has ever seen.
DONT BLAME ME, YOU VOTED XDDDDDD
Wow its really good, but im from russia and im sad, КОСМОС  dont win but 𝙵𝙸𝚁𝙴 𝙸𝙽 𝚃𝙷𝙴 𝙷𝙾𝙾𝙻
Is the song that used in the beginning of the video on Newgrounds?
Последняя частица версии 2.1❤
This year was big for GD.  God save us from what gonna happen in 2.2
FIRE IN THE HOLE
GD COLONN MY BELOVED
Robtop wins an award determined by robtop
this year was a great year for GD
0:48 the best WATER ON THE HILL level
Bruh

7:36 COLON LETS GO
I love gd cologne
13:40 Someone need to put here congregation
GuitarHeroStyles best GD YouTuber
갑자기 열심히 일하는 ROBTOP
13:41 am i only one who waited for Congregation jumpscare?
"RATE TIDAL WAVE 🤬😡‼️"
still crazy that the community didn't vote culuc in the best creator category
HAHA NO VOXICAT PICS FOR YALL KIDS
Yall know i had to say fire in the hole when i saw the normal face
WHY THERE'S NO NEXUS
When the 2.2 levels and platformers awards? In 2.21 or in 2.3?
Early gabg
Why does this feel like a bfdi votes video from 2018?
Was expecting a Congregation Jumpscare in the end 💀
Who else disliked this video because that furry fuck won best youtuber😭
where nexus
He had every opportunity to congregation jumpscare us in the end
I thought the end would 😭😭😭
RUB who's give you reward for the best gd video?
13:47 Everyone was waiting congregation
YESSIR ZOINK WON BEST PLAYER🔥🔥🎉🎉🎉
FIRE IN THE HOLE!  🗣🔥
Lmao i voted randomly
At some point you have to realize that the montage at the end is just watching viprin and nexus play popular levels
🦦🦦🦦🦦🦦🦦🦦🦦
hi
the fact that monolithos is underrated is frustrating me.
WHAT
robtop, why didn’t you write that Zoink verified the tidal wave? And why wasn’t the tidal wave rated?! 09:26
Robtop winning from his own video is crazy 😭
Very humble of RobTop
vote for the video created by Robtop of Geometry Dash Anniversary #10, the best video I've ever seen😎
честно я бы на месте робтопа отдал победу видосу про 14к человек строивших один уровень, он реально заслужил, это единственное видео по гд которое выделяется на фоне остальных очень сильно но все еще интересное в отличие от других в том топе. а видео роба ну просто крутое но явно не лучшее.
I think there should be an award for most underrated player and most underrated creator in the 2024 awards to give many underrated creators/players get some recognition
3:59 TOLD YA CHANGE OF SCENE WILL WIN💥💥💥
Edge of Destiny < Cytokinesis
If there was an Award for the most handsome, I would definitely come in last!!! 😎
ROBTOP!! WOW geometry dash is the best game I've ever seen, I love its playability, its community, the levels that the creators make, I love everything, Robtop, keep it up, don't stop, you're a machine, you're the best! <3
EVW lose by a fox💀
On the easy one i was expecting sonar by jerkrat and i freaked out when it wasnt on there i freaked out lol
13:38 I refuse to believe this wasn't done on purpose
Red Horizon and Sky and Soul by Creo at the end 🔥
GD COLOGNE
7:20 How is it that GD Colon won the award for best Youtuber if he only has a little more than 500k subs? What happened to GuitarHeroStyles? This man has 3.4 M subs and his most viewed video has 45 M views. You disappoint me RobTop. Dislike
i expected the 2.21 release date, but the video is very good regardless!!!
Gosh, the montage at the end really got to me cuz it shows how far we as a community have gotten. From a simple action platformer about cubes and triangles to pretty much a game engine at this point, it's no wonder I've played this game for over 9 years. Thank you, RobTop, for creating something truly special 🙏
13:44 My brother go make a meme with that ending. Me: (congregation jumpscare with sikky pogging.)
I haven’t heard this song in so long 🥹
13:40. Congregation jumpscare
WHY IS THE SILENT MOUSE TRAP SONG SO POPULAR  (Sky and Soul by Creo)
Robtop said "swag route let's go" after he released update 2.2 7 years later 💀💀💀
.3 from sikky to winning!
Fire in the hole?
=)
voting ISpy over Glorious Fortress is wild
NOOOOOOOOOO voxicat lose NOW I CAN'T SEE HIS THIGHS ANYMORE😭😭😭
lmao colon is canadian
guitar...
Hd colonde just won🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
Hello i'm player Cambodia 😢❤
I love robtop he saved gd in 2017
"FIRE IN THE HOLE" 😢
FIRE IN THE HOLE
I said what for WHAT by spu7Nix. Wow that was unexpected.
Wow ;) great job of showing the winners :D they will be so happy :D thank you RobTop. 🎉
Dude change of scene is so overrated,glorious fortress should have won instead
wait isnt gd cologne from canada not usa
Noo sikky dont win 😢
*horse
8:23 Hores riding time
Just wow.
Bad awards -20/10 y zzzzzzz
You get better each time
Good job to all the wonderful time and work you amazing level and content creators do for us! Without this wonderful comminuity geometry dash would not be where it would be now (and less fire in the holes)
w zoink
Rob where in December lobotomy???
13:37 Waiting for someone to make the congregation jumpscare...
please bro rate tidal wave and make it legendary
don't stop, please DON'T STOP
bruh why not KOCMOC
congratulations to all winners and nominees!!!!
my brother couldnt get to vote cuz the voting ended when he was voting 😐
Why do they call it “oven” when you of in cold food hot eat the food
No ganó Srguillester 😢
Epicwards, Robtop
you bothered adding tidal wave to the level montage and didn't rate it 😭
Level montage was clean 🔥
WHAT plowing past the others in best Hard level was hilarious
the fact that the last comment on the live chat was fire in the hole is crazy
8:32 Stolen prizes
Kivvi is underrated at the moment
I really hate that RobTop showed levels like tidal wave, when he's too lazy to even rate those masterpieces!
Rob should add a special badge on their profile indicating their achievements
My first lever demon is change of scene
Hola Robtop buen video sobre geometry dash awards 2 es increible esto es Perfecto❤😎👍
robtop became the new obama giving obama a medal
SIII CARAJO CHANGE OF SCENE MEJOR EASY DEMON DEL 2023
we all new it was gonna be bli
I just noticed that many of these clips are Robtop, he is getting better with demons.
I wanted to see a "best lobotomy level" so bad
🔥🕳️ 💦🗻 FIRE WATER IN THE HOLE ON THE HILL
This bro won his own award💀💀🤯🤯🤓 8:23
La canción distorsionada de fondo JAJAJJAJAJ
2:09 WHAT!?
RATE TIDAL WAVE
Finally an awards where Jonathan GD does not win due to fanaticism
No estuvo guitar hero styles
aint no way
FIRE IN THE HOLE
Wow so cool I think I will end my life now!
12:25 main levels remake confirmed by robtop??!!
A furry doesnt belong to be the best youtuber in gd
i closed the video tab at the ending as soon as the music started fading away
Is it just me, or did sikky just get robbed
"man i wish tidal wave was rated so it could be in here :(" "holy shi tidal wave??"
what is overrated, I don't see it fair that it wins a programmed level Instead of incredible levels like between worlds
Explorers when?  Not even 2.21, just explorers.
Fire in the hole
12:40
EL MEJOR VIDEO ES DE FERNANFLOO CON 11 MILLONES😁
Depature is also a level to compete in Waboo spike contest which who makes the most stylish looking spike gets money probably
I knew it. The Change of scene is top of the easy demon
Bruhhh, What is the best hard level?😂😂😂
I don’t know creators but I do know that these seem like good picks
2023 truly was a great year for Geometry Dash. So many amazing levels and of course 2.2.
eric not getting youtuber is criminal and i am prepared to sue
QUE SE NOTE LA HUMILDAD JAJAJAJAJA 8:16
un año mas dashers❤
Rob that ending was such a good opportunity for a congregation jumpscare
RATE TIDAL WAVE
Rate tidal wave 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
bruh wdym, zoink just beated the tidal wave. Why it not it notable demons? AND WHY ROB TOP DONT RATING THIS, TIDAL WAVE IS GOOD
Wheres La llorona?

8:22 obama awarding obama a medal b like
So cool to see how far geometry dashers have gone ❤
You suck robtop Srguillester>Cancer de Colon Dorami>Elquealacostaleapesta
Так топил за циту но увы💔
6:50 where is guitarherostyles and who are this randooms?
He made this video with the creator mode
2023 is a masterpiece.
Epic,amazing,fantastic,just perfect.
PLS ADD 2.11 OR 2.21 IN MARCH
WTF
RubRub!...
Song Name?
tidal wave please
the AUDACITY for rob to put tidal wave despite not rating it..
最後の映像、レートされてないレベルもいくつかあるのしっかり公式が認知してるんだなって感じがしてうれしい
1:45 What about the second path?
If I'm honest, they are the worst awards I've ever seen Pdt: El Pollo Ardiente
I'm sorry, TrickGMD deserved more credit. He literally beat the entire top 10.
Best Game Community!
the end was a perfect set up for a congregation jumpscare
incredibly good video imo
Que estafa no esta guitar
WE ALL SAW IT: RATE TIDAL WAVE
Tremedo
Appreciate all of you who voted for me in the Streamer category :)
2023 год был с лучшими уровнями а в 2024 будет ещё лучше и все коллабы будут казаться с первого раза без изменений очень хорошо
WHY AFTERLIFE IT SUCKS

Best awards by far, I love that!
all y’all tidal wave fanboys need to sit down like it’s a good level but like jesus we don’t care that you want it rated just shut up
RobTop: wow good job making this video Robtop
Y donde queda bloodlust y Bloodbath?💀
@panya4476 I voted for you, I really thought I was going to win your level, but crash game won, cherry as always 😞, great work by the decorators and layouters, I was delighted that it gained atmosphere :D
Rubrub: Robtop? Robtop: what? Rubrub:  is 2.21 out? Robtop: ...
Why are zoinks notable demons just not the top 3
NCS LEGEND
12:44 I've been thinking, what level is this?
😮
Robtop like "Tidal Wave is the level of 2023" "But... I won't rate it)"
2023 was a banger, but what’s to come in 2024?
Skibidi Robtop Yaya Robtop Ya Lionel Robtop Robtop Ronaldo
What by spu7nix is the most deserved W. Masterpiece of a level
Still curious why they didn't rate emerald realm
W
How tf did spacestation win its gameplay it's horrible and decoration isnt that good compared to nacimiento 😭😭
YO ROBTOP WITH THE FIRE MUSIC PIC 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
New gamemode idea ''paint''' you will only be able to touch one color it works like wave but when you. Tap gravity flips
poop
pl where is 2.2 Coming on Amazon kindle robtop
Hello Robtop, surely this comment could be one of the many but I do not rule out this possibility and it would be a good one to add all the Sub Zero and Meltdown levels in the same geometry dash. like a big update like 2.2. I hope you read this comment and if you like the idea you can give me a heart or comment. success :D
by 2.2 forsaken city i get my first demon
7:37 I know about all the controversies with Guitarherostyles (Advystyles), I don't want to take any side, but anyway, he's the biggest GD channel in the entire platform, below the Robtop official account
sikky deserved best streamer
love gd colon but EVW is the best gd youtuber come on
I wished Mulpan would win but gd colon winning is good too
change of scene is a fucking shit bro, ISpyWithMyLitleEye is best 💀
Bro pulled out the entire nostalgia playlist for this one
:DDD
Guitar Hero styles ninguno como ese
Rate Tidal Wave!
Samifying and wPopoff got robbed so hard ;-;
Most fire in the hole level
i love how the last comment was 'fire in the hole' even when the entire time people were spamming 'rate tidal wave'
I NEED A LIST OF ALL THE LEVELS IN THE ENDING MONTAGE
hype
1:23 fire in the hole
Sikky 😢
12:39 when will it be evaluated if you put it in the 2023 levels montage?
The music takes me back
Me recuerdan le dije de la 2.4😅😅😅
Robtop: congratulations Robtop you won the vote of best video :D Everyone: -_-
HELL YEAH NO LONGER THE SECOND BEST GO COLON
MulMul.. 😭
i feel like most of us dont know much about the levels here
aguante huitar
mr zoink  is BEST player of GD
its always funny seeing someone crying about guitar not winning
I wished the previews actually showed the best part of the level, then the ratings would be more equal
DEPARTURE WON YESSSSSS!!!!@
Missed opportunity for a congregation jumpscare 13:38
9:25 I stand by the fact that wPopoff is at least equal to zoink in skill
PUT TO GUITARHEROSTYLES PLS
Rate tidalwave
Where Culuc?
Tidal wave when?
Bombardeen RobTopGames
13:40 would have been the best congregation jumpscare in history
I thought the end was gonna be a congregation jumpscare
wow
The funniest part about Departure winning the award for BEST auto level is that it didnt even win the contest it was part of lmao
WHAT
13:46 it would be cool if it ended with a congregation jump scare lol    Edit : just got back to see my comment and i got 400 likes thx
spu7nix deserved the best hard level lets just be totally honest.
GUITAR :c
Fire In The Hole🔥🔥
Spu7nix got 3/4 of the votes haha
colon: bruh
2003Devin where
aint no way blud nominated himself and won
"Where the hell is Archeron?" - me
🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥FIRE IN THE HOLE !!1!!1!1!1!
edge of destiny guys. edge. of destiny. that excuse of a glow level, won over neutra and cytokenesis.

Herogitarstyle
Why is there no congregation jumpscare at the end
12:40 the tidal of wave
tidal wave being in the montage and STILL NOT RATED is insanity, nor was it mentioned under zoinks completions☠️
Hahahah Edge of destiny
Can’t believe SpaceUK won best player again 😂
What is this level 11:50 - 11:55?
12:38 TIDAL WAVE IS IN THE LEVEL MONTAGE?!?!!??
The moving lines were evil
Huh, TITAL WAVE will rate😅😅😅😅
I cant believe 2 levels for my CC2 were nominated and one actually won best hard demon, feels like I have a legacy in the game now, all super good levels though
S7upinx and zoink nailed it 😌
FINALLY bringing the creo music back to the awards, an absolute necessity
Rubrub used the this song like dude its not 2018
Woah happy
Why did I genuinely expect a congregation jumpscare at the end
I should have been in the youtuber one, i have the best videos
Change of scene is so overrated. Glorious Fortress and Tectonic Tempo have such a great *feel* to then on top of looking amazing. It's just sad to see the brainwashed little kids having the majority of the vote on this poll. Also Bli winning creators by extension is sad to see
I LOVE GD COLGATE ‼️‼️❣️❣️❣️
Rate tidal wave
i really was expecting a congregation jumpscare at 13:40 but no sadly 😢
Man I hoped that rob would put himself to the best creator spot. That would have been so funny
Pls bring back old physics
I didn't even vote lol
Fuego en el hoyo!!🗣️🔥🕳️
LETS GO RAIN WORLD LEVEL W 💯💯💯💯
If bli dosnt won the best easy demon and best creator this world is not real
Loved it
FIRE IN THE HOLE
Nexus GD 😢😢😢
Hi Rob, I have a question. When will you release update 2.21? You said that it'll gonna come out in few weeks and guess what it's been almost 2 months. Why?
WHY ROBTOP ALWAYS FORGOT THE BEST NA LEVEL 😂😂😂😂
I used to love Change of Scene but I'm really starting to dislike it solely because of how much attention it is stealing from other amazing and often more deserving levels
I personally think its hilarious that departure won best auto level but didnt even win in the spike video 💀
we need Tidal Wave
who else thought the end was going to be a congregation jumpscare
Bli deserved it all
Congrats to the winners! A few i dont really think should have won, but hey thats just me
i love gd cologne
12:59 competition park
NOOOOOO SIKKY LOST
robtop: best video goes to... robtop!
13:40 you missed the perfect spot...
THANK YOU ROB 🙏❤
YES THE FUNNY RAIN WORLD LEVEL WON LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
gdcolon didn't deserve it
I will look back fondly on this game and community even when I am 100 years old...
4 hours ago ( I thought that congregation jumpscare in the end)
I love how rubrub awarded himself 😭
Best Youtuber: GuitarHeroStyles.
That ending montage was beautiful

Best Fire in the Hole level
“Hi hello hi”

gotta love the fact that tidal wave as acknowledged at 12:39 but still not rated lol
Thanks for the votes everyone! Congrats to all the winners!
Why glorious fortress and ispy😭😭
Pls play my lvl 99988947 is cool
My reaction to what getting 70% WHAT
In my own opinion, Nexus have to be in 2nd or 3rd best player because he hace been played it for 7 years, and he is good at playing he never give up
what is the first song in the level montage called?
I love gd cologne
GG
So glad I voted for GD Colon
dang it he did not win
I love geometry dash and robtop
GD COLON FO DA WIN LESSS GOOOOOOO🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
How does EOD win????????
Departure by G4lvatron was actually in a Waboo challenge
zZoink for the win!!!
Hi RobTop Who is RubRub?
I love gd :)
it feels like seasonal haven was really overlooked. It came last place of the insane levels but still is one of the best insanes of all time imo
Naaaah Tidal Wave being in a robtop vid before getting even rated is wild
Boomer lost damn
Massage to robtop, Why you deleted force smoothfix I need it bc my phone so laggy 1.5 gb, PLEASE READ MY MASSAGE!!!!  I can't beat any level and easy level stero maddess
This Impossible Game remake looks pretty cool.
Wow... I am extremely upset that Samifying didn't win best video. Maybe I'll make a video about this...
tectonic tempo is such an underrated level man... :(
I love the departure, its a very good auto lvl
Les go
Im in absolute shock that CuLuC wasnt even a nominee
❤ :)
The fact that sikky was 0.3% away from being the best streamer is crazy. Congrats on everyone that got nominated 🎉
Don’t get me wrong the 10 year anniversary video is amazing. But I think the most infamous level in gd video should’ve won.
Fire in the Hole
Robtop giving himself the award is like that picture of Obama
I was really hoping sikky was gonna win best streamer
QWERTY Qué 😯😳🤨🥺😅😌😁👍✨✨❤️💖
the fact that doggie got more votes than trick and popoff just shows how much of a popularity contest the gd awards are
GD COLON LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Nice
HOLY SHIT EDGE OF DESTINY IS MY FAVORITE LEVEL
should have been floating outskirts :(
Mulpan’s content is so funny tho. I love mulpan❤😂
when i'm in a best hard level competition and my opponent is what by spu7nix
Where is mulpan???
when dudes skip to go to the best player awards best content creator best streamer
ROBTOP ACKNOWLEDGES TIDAL WAVE BUT DOESNT RATE 😭
"Well the comunity like my video best oh well " - Rob And i can say its true :P
TIDAL WAVE SHOWN!!!!!
HE NOTICED EMERALD REALM THIS IS OUR CHANCE
congratulations to all winners, its awesome to see how much did the community do in just a year
Bro zzoink at the best player he moved an inch and I was like HUH? and he exploded
2003devin???????? NO??????????? DEVIN NO HAVE AWARD FOR HIS LEVEL CALLED WORLD WAR OOOOOOOOOOOOO TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
Robtop arwarded him self
Funny how Tidal Wave still isnt rated but its in the montage anyway
1:21 BEST FIRE IN THE HOLE LEVEL :0
I love how Nexus footage is like 80% of the video lol
can't believe growing with the community after 7 years without an update is wild
the montage at the end was mid asf
Honored to have my Collab featured in the recap 🙏  The community is awesome
this is a little Nostalgic... i miss 2.1... okno
Wow no best lobotomy, what a shame
spu7nix wasnt even a nominee for best creator??
Change of scene is overrated IMO
RIGGED
eric shouldve won yall smoking some crazy shit
13:37 this wouldve been THE best congregation jumpscare tbh
1:20 FIRE IN THE HOLE
What’s the 11:59 level?
La música del inicio trae recuerdos de Vietnam
12:41 Finally
congrats to gd colon 🥳
feels bad for mulpan tbh, Extremely underrated
13:38 im gonna be completely honest to you all, I fully expected a congregation jumpscare here
rate tidal wavee
WHY TF IS EMPYREAN THIRD WTF
Those 3 levels (glorious, change of scene, ispy) were a pretty hard choice for me, theyre really good and well-made levels so yes  Aswell as 3 levels from best extreme demon (eod, kocmoc, cyto) was difficult because they were one of my favorites
best fire in the hole:fire in the hole 1
i thought the end would have a congregation jumpscare
Can't believe robtop missed the best ever congregation jumpscare ever at the end
Robtop can you please give the release date of 2.21 plz🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
there should have been a congregation jumpscare
rate tidal wave
Booooooo trash
Guitarherostyles best youtuber
i was expecting a fucking congregation jumpscare to be at the end there was no way
SIKKY ALMOST WON
What a banger year 2023 was for GD. Hope to see this game grow even more in the years to come 🔥
Robtop received an award for his video🤑
Good job GD Cologne you did it
To top awarded himself, bruh…
i love gd cologne
Dude I was really hoping the most infamous geometry dash level would have won, that was one of the best videos I’ve ever seen, I loved the editing and was hooked the entire time. Definitely check it out
Gd colon got most vote is so unsightreadable
12:06 WORKD WIDE BROADCAST!!!!
Chave cz😊
fire in da hole
Nah pigchefer got robbed, why I stopped trying was amazing
na na na arregladisimo
I hate to be sikky
Guitaaaaaaaaaar FALTA GUITAAAARARRARARARSCHCKHHKHKLHFHLLJFJGKGKGKGITTJ
Robtop mentioned tidal wave!!!! (Good montage doggie)
I thought there's a congregation jumscare at the end lol
Rob you forgot to add best Grandpa Demon again 😭😭
I’m so glad I came back to gd.
I have to know the id for 11:48
When 2.2
KOCMOC, Nacimento, Carting Dash losing really hurts me, but I'm glad "Change of scene", Colone and bli won their nominations.
YOOOOOO CD MUSIC:O NO WAAYYY GGGG
9:23 zoink winning meaning that he is a legend of verifying top 1-3 demons
chorizo votes
hello
13:41 i was totally expecting a congregation jumpscare  😂

GGS NPESTA
FIRE IN THE HOLE

“Gee I wonder who is winning best player. In my opinion I think is gonna be pretty close”
What a beautiful game robtop has made
2:12 WHAT has the best visuals
lmao the video showcased for colon
Okay, at this point, liking bli and/or Change of Scene is just hopping on the bandwagon.
Not all the levels I wanted to win did super well but I'm glad the community has these awards
And  Guitarherostyles?😢
Oigan y guitar🤨🤨🤨🤨?
DAMN BLI 🐐
Message to Floppy : NO, BECAUSE THERE'S A LEVEL MONTAGE DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE ANOTHER PAINFUL LEVEL WITH BAD TRANSITIONS TAKING THEM ALL BACK !
Its funny that robtops own video won
wooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
2023 was one of the best years for gd imo, so many good levels, and 2.2
Is it weird that when afterlife came out I made a video stating  it was the best 3 start, I guess I was right
ok but can you rate tidal wave please
Ending should have been a congregation jumpscare, it'll make the video 10x better imo
Gg
Rip atmos, I dont think many people know of it
THEY USED THE 2 BEST CREO SONGS FOR THE END I'M CRYING😭
11:58 pure satisfaction
1:22 If you check the live chat during this part, almost the whole chat is spamming “FIRE IN THE HOLE!” because 8 year olds have a broken sense of humor
fire in thy hole
what, trick is the best player
hello this is amazing :D
Sikky was so close from winning😢😢😢😢
Quien es GD colon? 💀💀💀
9:53 is that the emerald realm CuLuC's part? Why show it here if you wont even rate it, Rob?
Faltó más fire in the hole.
El video del 10 Aniversario era una mentira, y aún así ganó >:v
WE FIRING IN THE HOLE WITH THIS ONE 🗣️‼️‼️‼️🔥🔥‼️🥶
RobTop can there be a way of playing official levels with the “Song” trigger in 2.2? If your level doesn’t start with any official level music?, also i like your game so much 😁
Other games need to learn from this master piece of a community and game
Bro has the audacity to put tidal wave in bro just rate it who gives a crap about the mods opinions
KIIIIIIIIIIIIVVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII AAAAAAAA
Guillester merecia tener más votos que EVW y Mulpan, pero GD Colon tiene buen contenido.
Damn I laughed so hard when the easy and normal faces came out for the relative categories. I can't help it anymore...
Sami should have won the best video, that silent clubstep video was never before seen quality for this community
edge of destiny won for other reasons
como gano gd colon bro 💀💀
Best video is def rigged
*insert that one obama meme*
Love how tidal wave is in the montage but he won't rate it
first time i voted in the awards :)
Robtop really just did a Barack Obama with that one.
sayitback should've won
Btw gd archiver is so cool and appeared 3 times in the rewind
GG
Do a monthly one of these
Rate tidal wave!!!! 🌊
What is this
LOST TO TIME BY BILLYG NO WAYYYYY 11:53
Best fire in the hole😂
Robtop rate tidal wave bruhhhh 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊

RATE TIDAL WAVE!
FIRE IN THE HOLE
samifying got robbed
Ok but was I the only one expecting a congregation jumpscare at the end
ZOINK WINS
Y así nos despedimos de los awards 2.1 para dar el paso a los awards 2.2 😊  Gracias por todo 2.1 ❤
imagine losing an award by 0.3% of 74,504 people
RATE TIDAL WAVE
colon is 😫😫😫😫😫
RATE TIDAL WAVE

Best YouTuber is GD Cologne Robtop: Skibidi toilet yes yes
8:04 noo pigchefer :(

Thanks for putting this on!
Sayitback and jumper copy should have won
cool not bad
I WAS WAITING FOR A CONGREGATION JUMPSCARE AT THE END THERE.
GD is such a spectacular game
Under 2 hours award claim in the replies
NO WAY TIDAL WAVE IS IN THE VIDEO BUT YOU WONT RATE IT
Someone in the future: I recreated this entire video in geometry dash 2.2
QUE HERMOSO FINAAAAAAAAL DIOS MIO COMO EDITOR ESTUVO BUENISIMOOOOOOO DIOS QUE GRAN PRODUCCION LA DE AHORA :DDDDD
ZOONK WON LESS GOOOOO
Pleasure to be here
Acknowledge tidal wave robtop you nerd
“WHAT” by Spu7nix is godly
You messed up the best yter, you’re too humble robtop :3
I am thailand And Playgeomtry  dasb😊😊😊🎉🎉🎉
I feel so bad for Sikky he’s probably never gonna get that close to winning anything ever again
Niceee
YES ZOINK YES ZOINK YES ZOINK YES ZOINK YES ZOINK YESSSSFINALLY
should've put npesta's kenos reaction in
I don't understand why RobTop didn't put a Congregation jumpscare at the end
Okeeey
I Find The Hard Level Category Amazing As 75,185 Votes Were Cast Yet 75.4% All Agreed On The Same Level Being The Greatest But That’s Not Surprising Though WHAT Is Absolutely Brilliant (Similar Thing Applies To Best Players With 75,447 Votes And 67% All Bowing Down To Zoink’s Power)
W
Afterlife now it becomes Fire in the hole
YYYYEEEESSSSSSSSS
11:11 VLACC LEVEL LETS GO
Where is tidal wave for zoinks acheivments
claps,claps
😁
9:50 creo mentioned !!!!
12:40 and RobTop still didn't rate it 💀
swag route letz goouuuuu
Мой топ 3 лучших экстрим демонов 3-Kocmoc 2-Edge of destiny 1-Empyrean
I looove gd cologne
Gd levels are never gonna be the same
i really liked 'why i stopped trying' but ig not from an active gd player so oh well
?
this is indeed a game  about... pretty much everything to be fair
I was really hoping that “The most infamous level” made by sami was going to win, the production was amazing on that vid. But the 10 year anniversary is also very good.
WHAT
How is relic dive rated and tidal wave isn’t
I don’t care what robtop does, but he needs to RATE TIDAL WAVE
GD probably has the best community I've ever seen. (Maybe before tetris) l am so proud of being a part of this community, even though I wasn't even close to making a minor difference, I still loved everything I have experienced. The fact that the whole community managed to keep the game alive for 7 years is insane. Also the lineup was crazy this year. Rush would have a chance if it weren't for WHAT, but I am very happy with all the results!
And colon is still American apparently
8:14 LITERALLY THE OBAMA MEME
This was probably the best year for gd by far!!!! We got so many good levels, player activity was at its peak and we got  2.2 at the end pf the year. This is absolutely amazing and I love this community so much
the called gd colon american again
Great gane and great comunity  Thank you Robtop 🫶❤️
Shout out to all the hard rated levels that got destroyed by What
❤
2:15 ez win
Yay Colon won :D
RATE TIDAL WAVE
Robtop won in his own competition XD
Why is nexus not on awards
Thank god for a slaughterhouse ripoff not winning the best extreme of the year🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
i think robs teasing us with tidal wave
ZOINK!!!!!
Bli won best creator, and the change of scene won the best level again
How (⁠✷⁠‿⁠✷⁠)🎉❤
why was almost expecting a congregation jumpscare at the very end of the video
robtop missed a perfect opportunity at the end to get us with a congregation jumpscare
12:39 the best part
Song:  Jim Yosef - Link
I made list 2023 awards winners
Glad that GD Cologne won an award
8:23 ROBTOP: tu corona           ROBTOP: Gracias:)
DIVERTIDO ME QUEDO
Holi Shyt how far this community is going is unbelievable
ROBTOP! GDCOLON IS THE BEST YOUTUBER! THIS MEANS IT TIME TO REMOVE GENERATION RETRO OFF THE POISON GAUNTLET!
I was sure there was gonna be a congregation jumpscare at the end lol
I think WHAT won best hard. IDK it’s Kinda close
Can’t wait to see what 2024 brings to geometry dash
It is just mind blowing how much this game has grown. Last year, the voting averaged around 20k. Now, there are nearly 70k votes on each award. Can’t wait to see what it’ll be next year!
Bro I'm so pissed at these people spamming "Rate Tidal Wave" bro for the love of god piss off
rigged awards rate tidal wave 👎
10:28 why does it seem like everyone just forgot about RENDER 😭😭 Drift worked 6 years on it and you just disrespect him like this???
Jau
2:15 MAN WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS
Alr new question and might be a problem again😂😂         2.21 when???
Bometry dash
Thanks Everyone :)
Hello
Y vieneeeee mi programa favorito el mas sexual
early gang 1h ago
Xyah3hu
13:37 its perfect for a congregation jumpscare
People who made it early:  👇👇
The music😭
Empyrean and Floating Outskirts: less than 10% Kocmoc: 25% ☠️☠️
Right, my birthday september?, im choosing tidal wave bro
Fire in tje hole!!!
8:22  Rubrub took "nah i'd win" to a whole new era 🗿🗿
I love your channel robtop
Imagine if Tectonic Tempo won💀
Gdcolon winning is the worst community decision ive seen in any game
hot
i think we should pull another youtube rewind 2018 on this one
w Zoink best player
i love gd colon
the end would have been a perfect congregation jumpscare
I honestly think that the best video award was kinda rigged, the creator of the game, video, and awards won it. And spu7nix got second with a BANGER video. Also Spu7Nix unfortunately didn’t get nominated for the best content creator.
MULPAN GANG WHERE WERE YOU?
seeing colon win ruined my day
8:02 the fact that ppl said that it's rigged when some people even voted for him to win💀
great video! when's 2.3
The medium demon vote count was painfully close to 69420
10:17 what is that level pelease???
Under 100k squad ⬇️
roblox tycoon ahh song
missed it by one hour :C
WHAT! the hell spu7nix 74%
9:46  I LITERALLY USED CREO- SKY AND SOUL IN MY LVL (but used a diff song lol)
Este comentario va a ser olvidado entre losmptros
The video should have ended with a congregation jumpscare.
Change of scene probably the best level in 2023 but white space is still the Greatest of all time.
i hate everyone who voted for gd cologn
It’s so exciting to see how the talent in this community grows every year. It gets better and better. Awesome work to the nominees and winners. Can’t wait to see what we accomplish in 2.2 ❤
i love gd cologne
Best hard level stood no chance
Bro wtf 😂 edge of destiny It's Blade of Justice, is it serious that they voted for a reheated one?
could be a tiny footage of every nomination while % part to remember every one of them
Missed opportunity at the end to have the cube fall into Congregation.  This has been a great year for GD. Congrats to all the winners! :)
Robtop : 12:40 *shows tidal wave* Also Robtop : *proceeds to not rate tidal wave*                PS : now it is rated so this comment is already outdated ...
Wow, the choice for easy demons was insanely hard. Glorious Fortress, ISpy and Change of Scene in one year.
Robtob I want a level on my pls
NOOOO MULPAN
Are you’re older games still available and being up to date?
NPESTA MY GOAT🗣
Cologone is American?  Pretty sure that's far too south.
13:40 Congregation Jumpscare Point
The highlights of each month at the end of the video made me realise how big of a year 2023 was for the game. So many of my favourite levels came out this year.
GDColon is the best?! Fy!
I love gd colonge
I'm so glad that Bli Won The Best Easy Demon Trophy
Kocmoc was 2nd best extreme??? Scam. I hate Kocmoc.
RobTop getting an award himself. [insert Obama giving a medal to Obama meme]
RubRub pls rate tidal wave that zZoink verified Plsssssss um I think it is top 1 extreme demon and featured lev
I love this game.
0:38 he may have lost the battle, but he won the war.
2023 was a great year for Geometry Dash, ngl.

WHY LIONEL MESSI DOESN'T WON THE GD AWARDS, HE DESEVERED IT🤬
You just uploaded the video at 4:00 am in my hometown and I woke up at 5:00 am.
Why gd colon won the best YouTuber
FIRE IN THE HOLE 🙂🔥
Me at the end of the video expecting a Congregation jumpscare:
Robtop has no say in what demons are rated as the process for rating demons is entirely up to the moderators, and ALSO the entire montage including the Tidal Wave part was edited by Doggie, not Rob
I love it ❤
FIRE IN THE HOLE!! 🗣️🔥
Why didn't I know the top Geometry Dash youtuber? I didn't even watch a single video made by him lul.
YO "why I stopped trying" got *2.2*%
12:38 YOU DID NOT JUST INCLUDE TIDAL WAVE JUST FOR IT TO NOT BE RATED
8:12 rubrub is so humble he won his competition
7:46 SKIBIDI TOILET MENTIONEDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!
the tidal wave?
tiktok mfs boutta have an emotional breakdown after finding out ispywithmylittleeye didn’t make it
Hello Mr.Rob, Can I have some top?
Who is Colon???
13:38 everyone getting ready for a congregation jumpscare
Dam geometry dash as a whole has come a godamn way this is crazy. Tysm Rob
Doggie has been screwed over in these awards by a hacker, a pedo, and a high schooler
Guys i'm so happy 14,000 people build a level won best video!
KOCMOC IS UNDERRATED
Meanwhile Robtop:
8:18 i love the top 1 best gd video
WHAT NO CONGRETION JUMPSCARE AT THE END... YOU SET IT UP PERFECTLY
no wonder best extreme was edge of destiny :D
i expected a congregation jumpscare
W Bli
Tiene sentido que robtop allá ganado sus propios premios jajaja
Cuando  sale  la 2.21
Skibidi Toilet is now part of GD History
ambatablow
A congregation jumpscare at the end would have been SOOO PERFECT!
tidal wave isnt rated yet it showed up AT THE END OF THE VIDEO
Siiiii gano chage of scene vallanse toedos a la mrd
Robtop has the balls to put tidal wave in here but not rate it ...
WHY DIDNT YOU GUYS VOTE MULPAN!??!?!?!?!?! HE HAVE MULPAN CHALLENGES FANART EVEN HIS OWN SONG HOW IS THAT NOT ENOUGH?!!?!?!??    WHY DOES GD COLON GET THE VOTES!?!?!?!?!?
2023 fue el mejor año después de mucho caos mundial❤

8:16  RopTop gives best video reward to himself
❤❤❤❤GG
Extremely sad that Floating Outskirts wasn't even included in the ending montage of the video, but on another hand, there have been some really awesome levels recognized in this awards event.
Siiiiiiiii.GANAMOS LA GUERRA DE LOS EASY DEMONS!
I feel like Viprin should be getting paid at this point
We love gd colounge
A bit sad that Poolrooms wasn't in here, but it didn't make the showcase any worse
congrats to the winners!! :)
oh my god the song... 2017 vibes
Eod, really? Космос better
Ладно
Evw robbed
7:19 Duela a quien le duela, el mejor de todos los tiempos siempre será GuitarHeroStyles, nadie puede tapar el sol con un dedo
Tectonic tempo was snubbed at the Dashies
Empyrean better...
Floating Outskirts was robbed, nothing could beat an extreme demon platformer minigame made in 2.11  Unfair
I missed everything😭
Chat spamming rate tidal wave is crazy
no salio guitar XDDDDD
A new journey begins...
All what I'll say is...  I loooove gd cologne.
Just rate tidal wave if ur gonna put it in the video LOL
Rate tidal wave
Ok, people just do that now.
that end had a massive potential to have a congregation jumpscare
"KOCMOC" by Cherryteam
Best Lobotomy level?
Why robtop dont add french gd players in the gd awards ( like mrsphaghetti)?
Aeon should've won not GD Cologne 🥲
1 hour gang ⬇️
Tidal wave rate when?
YALL DISSED AUDIEO, THAT MAN IS PEAK
THIS IS A TRUE GD COLOGNE MOMENT
very sad about empyrean losing, still pretty cool stuff this year though
Democracy has failed humanity
:0'
Yooo
Its a rob that in Best video appears robtop instead of rafer, cuz he did all the animation
new categorie impossible level
I LOVE GD COLOGNE
sky and soul was such a good song to use during the 2023 recap part
I liked my own comment
Gg guys..
The music back from 2014 💀💀
As a person who started playing this game this year (2023) i can say without a doubt its one of the most welcoming communitys. Thanks.
RATE TIDAL WAVE 🗣💥
Awesome
How the hell did colon win??
I feel like RobTop is purposefully not rating Tidal Wave until people completely forget about it or stop begging for it. And knowing the GD community, neither of these scenarios is gonna happen at least anytime soon 💀
ngl i was expecting a congregation jumpscare at that ending.
pls stream again RobTop we are all waiting
as soon as zoink showed up everyone started spamming "rate tidal wave" lol (i agree with that statement)
What 1 hour    A normal jumping game in the hands of the right player is a beautiful level
I don't really got the 2.2 stuff bro
zZoink notable demons where is acheron?
X1RON got robbed 😭🙏
FIRE IN THE HOLE
Here’s my thoughts on each category   Auto: Obviously departure won but goofy map had a very unique design style I think it deserved more votes  Easy: Nacimiento is really good and was what I voted for but I’m fine with spacestation winning   Normal: I voted for afterlife but I thought karting dash would win and afterlife won   Hard: What won, that’s it  Harder: I didn’t vote on this one   Insane: I didn’t vote on this one  Easy demon: They’re all good but ispy got more votes than glorious fortress somehow   Medium demon: I didn’t vote on this one  Hard demon: I didn’t vote on this one   Insane demon: Don’t really care about this category but I voted jumper copy cause I kinda thought it was funny that it got into the gd awards  Extreme demon: I voted for edge of destiny and it rightfully won  Streamer: I voted sikky but they’re all good   YouTuber: Voted Colon colon won, that’s it  Best video: Why was GD10 there, it’s an official gd video which took the win away from the community and what the community has made, also why I stopped trying deserved a lot more votes  Best creator: No surprise bli rightfully won  Best player: Another not surprising win   Overall good, underall bad
Still really bummed Monolithos didn't win
hi robtop
Todos sabemos que si no hubiese pasado todo el tema de guitar, el seria el ganador de el mejor youtuber de geometry dash. Porque los que fueron nominados no le llegan ni a los talones a Guitar.
If you know you know... 7:27  OFC IT'S TRIDE AND GD COLON THEY'RE MY FAVORITE GD YOUTUBERS
8:15 Robtop dandose el premio a el mismo🗿
Was kind of expecting a Congregation jumpscare at the end.
GD COLONGE W
people who think KingSammelot should have won best youtuber  👇🏻
I was expecting a Congregation jumpscare at the very end...
And the real votes for when bruh
RobTop just created a masterpiece Game… I remember i was a little kid and played this game and directly started with the hardest level in gd lite 🤣 Now im 4 years older and still play this good game. Thank you RobTop. :D                                                   (Rate Tidal Wave lol)
8:11 Bro won an award from himself 💀💀💀
*2023* the Best Year ❤
7:17 Nepesta is going to recreate his kenos reaction when he sees this

EVW robbed
WHERE IS GUITARHEROSTYLES?
womp womp look what has arrived
Pocke was robbed :( He deserved at LEAST a single top 3 spot...
Interlude shoulda won. Rigged
nice
Great awards video but the irony of tidal wave being in it but not rated is hilarious
playing since 2014 and i still love this game <3
i was here
Roberto se premio a si mismo :0
Just shows that it don't matter how well your gameplay is, when all the community prefers is how the level looks. So many good levels lost to others just because they looked good. Also, the fact that RobTop's video won the award is hilarious.
No guitar = votaciones amañadas
Rate Tidal wave.
YEAH COLON!!!!!
cool
when this was about to premiere, I had to take a bath so I decided to use my switch and watch it while having a bath. It was quite an interesting experience.
¡WOW THIS IS AMAZING!
everyone be like "RATE TIDAL WAVE" but i'm a "RATE BLAST PROCESSING COPY" person
yay
Congrats to these wonderful winners of the awards!
12:41 SO YOU PUT TIDAL WAVE IN THIS BUT YOU WON'T RATE IT CRAZYYY (I hate mod votes)
bonito montaje el del final y felicidades a todos lo ganadores
Rob literally nominated himself
11:51 YOOOO LOST TO TIME!!
SO COOL!
Glad I was a part of the 27% that voted for iSpy. Change of Scene definitely deserved it though.
da music
11:47 THAT TRANSITION GOES SO HARD BRO
Cool.
bro did gd cologne dirty 😭
the edit dosen't compare to the 10th year anniversary
13:40 shouldve put cong jumpscare
RIP Tectonic Tempo. Personally my pick for easy Demon but with the power houses it was going against, it wasn’t gonna pull
Rate tidal wave
Glad Change of Scene took the Title : Best easy demon
Лучший креатор это Серпонж! Алё!
why did geometry dash 10 year anniversary win
I've been playing this game for about 10 years, but I started on an old Samsung, I remember trying to pass Dry out at school recess, Lmao. And now I'm 21 years old.
Wow
GOO
Seasonal haven got robbed 😢
I thought Colon was Canadian
No se pudo decorar abendregen :(
Awesomesauce
Colon is not american
NOOOOO GUILLESTER
7:40 💀💀💀
13:41 could have so easily been a congregation jumpscare 😅
They got Colon's country wrong still lmao
funny cube game :)
what a year. this community is amazing
Yay! Congratulations to all the winners! You did a great job!
say whatever you want, the music is the best
They doing advystyles like “Chris Benoit”
bro put tidal wave on the video but doesn't rate it
What is the name of this level ? 11:48
INSANE, AMAZING, GREAT JOB EVERYONE HOLY S*** :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Whirl!
7:35 ARE YOU KIDDING???? FUCK THE GD COLON, EVW IS LIFE!!!
I still think EVW should've won best youtuber, but ofc Colon has good content no hate at all
Why is Tidal Wave in the notable levels section if it's not even rated? RATE TIDAL WAVE
I feel a bit bad because guitarherostyles is not in this video 😔
can we talk about the clips they chose for colon?
10:22 feels unreal seeing my level in RobTop's channel. I love this game, tysm ❤️
BRUH THE INTERNET HAS RUINED ME! I thought there was bout to be a congregation jumpscare at the end
Where's GuitarHeroStyles ??
Sikky was so close but congrats to Npesta for being the best streamer
words cannot describe how relieved i am that change of scene beat ispywithmylittleye
Bo good le vedio
Mejor saca la 2.3
ROBTOP  YOUR  THE BEST🎉🎉❤❤❤
Let's be honest, the best streamer award went to guitarherostyles 😕
And explorers
rate tidal wave
I’m so glad I won! I want to thank uhh… uhhh
U woke me up from mi slumber rob top
The potential for a congregation jumpscare during those last few seconds
I was expecting a congregation jumpscare at the end lol
1:25 FIRE IN THE HOLE 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🕳️🕳️🕳️🔥🔥🕳️🗣️🕳️🔥
When robtop puts a video of tidal wave  My mind: New extreme demon in Rocket league and collab Claim your rewards and pass the game with 3-0 goals I die in 99% in all i need 😔
7:21 Guitarherostyles >>>>>>
the fact that rob won their own award
Tidal Wave is crazy, why did everyone choose it? like-
no way karting dash didn't win
13:46 What if this was A Congregation Jumpscare 😈
The fact that “why I stopped trying” only got 2% is depressing. It’s one of my favorite vids ever.
I heard Red Horizon by Creo and momentarily thought that one of my levels would be displayed. Then I remembered: I have no creator points nor people who play my levels. I am proud of what these creators have accomplished though.
1:23 Best Lobotomy Level
Man, sikky was only off by 0.3% 😭
The best player is smiffy
RATE TIDAL WAVE 🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
No way gd cologne is better youtuber than evw
Colon's part shows us that Robtop definitely saw skibidy toilet geometry dash...
Wow is my first reaction the awards 2023 is amazing
AUDIEO VISUAL WON FOR ME!

Congrats to robtop for winning 😁
Please don't rate tidal wave Or i gonna kill myself
robtop, спасибо тебе за 2.2
RobTop was so Humble, he only gave himself 1 award
En the Best extreme Demon por qué no apareció Limbo?
F*CK TOU ROBTOP, how'd you postulate your own video
Hay que decir que What y Dash fueron de los niveles que salieron en 2.023 más esperados por toda la comunidad
i wish i the most infamous level in geometry dash won i love it
ggw iwner
tidal wave should just be rated because of so much of the community wanting it at this point 💀
Furry won best youtuber 💀
shit i wasn't here
Damn last seconds of the video would be perfect for a congregation jumpscare
Congrats to everyone who won awards :D Looking forward to seeing more from 2.2.

lol
5:36 que humilde robtop ganando sus propios awards🤓

EVW should’ve won best yt
EOD is better than kocmoc, kill me pls
Congrats to the winners and nominees though. Really talented community dude, gotta love this.
I know this isn't related to this but I NEED 2.2 ON THE AMAZON TABLET
Bro sikky lost by 0.03 percent😭😭😭
Robtop rate tidal wave faster
dang
The moment it said the best "hard level" I immediately knew it was WHAT but man did Between Worlds deserved better. It is genuinely my favorite non-demon level, simply just so good
12:39 the fact that they know it exists but it's still unrated
I LOVE GD COLONGE
Congrats to everyone!
When the option you voted for wins: “OHHH LETS GOOOO YEAHHHHHHH”  When the option you voted for loses: *_depression, nothing matters in life anymore. eternal sadness_*
someone HAS to make a congregation jumpscare for that ending
I love GD colonge
7:44 NO WAY

Growing insane is underrated
rob top being the best game dev ever
I LOVE GD COLOGNE
I'm glad for the Cherryteam, they performed very well this year. It’s sad that cytokinesis was underrated, because the level is much better than KOCMOC and Eod
if i were bli i would have be the biggest ego rn
Why is adventure not best easy? EXPLAIN
I would never have expected to hear Yosef here
Where is 2.2on Amazon fire robtop

what.
Porque no sale Nexus o guitar 😢
bro included tidal wave here but didn’t include it on Zoink’s profile
kivvvi 2nd best creator empyrean 10% best extreme like why ppl just voted edge of destiny bc of culucs part, else its horrible
they use the nostalgia playlist for the track selection <3
W awards
I hate that people just vote on visuals and not gameplay
12:40 isnt tidal wave unrated? or is it because zoink's verification was invalidated by the fps counter?
I swear if zoink wins best player..
187305 listsssss

Congratulations to all nominees and winners.
Most people probably voted 10 year aniversary as a joke

when 2.21 is out their is going to Ben levels memes everywhere
the most infamous level in gd should have won
they really chose an nc level over ocellios  I am biased because ocellios is my first h d
Guille noooo 😭
i voted

Good job gd cologne! (He’s Canadian not American btw)
It's amazing how both Icarus and Waboo's Contests brought us two winners (Nomostros Cosmos and Departure) and also a nominee (Ring Trick)

Just rate Tidal Wave please
This must been a fun year for this community, even though it's already 2024. All of the nominees are fantastic, thank you for making GD great again.  I got 11 points, which is way better than I expected. Departure, Spacestation, Afterlife, WHAT, Change of Scene, TURNING POINT, Crash Game, Edge of Destiny, the GD 10th Anniversary video, Bli, and Zoink got my vote.  I don't play any harder levels alot, but I'm kinda bummed that Radiant Glen didn't won. Wild Card, same thing as Radiant Glen, kinda bummed about it too. Kinda sad that Ocellios didn't won, it's such a cool level. SiKKy is very unfortunate because he's so close to win best streamer, ah well I'll take Npesta win then. EVW I was hoping to win, oh well Colon I'm fine with him, he's a cool guy.  Again, thank you for making GD great again, it's been a fun year for us. <3
sometimes
Real
I like how Tidal Wave is in the video despite STILL not being rated yet
Naw bro, why did you all vote for robtop's own video, when you could have done su7nix's 1400 player one. he deserves it
8:53 change of scene is overrated
Emerald realm?
Lobomonty dash?
omg
dont forget that zoink verified tidal wave (top 1) but it isnt rated...
Tidal Wave now appears in an official video by RobTop, it has to get rated cmon

Tipo B in the video, ARE YOU SEEING THIS CLASSIC10!???
i love colon but come on, evw has been on such a grind and i think he should be recognised as the best
Can you use Kevin Macleod songs next time? It'd be fire *in the hole*

Hello RobTop keep up with your game, I really like it anyways bye!
Change of scene is overrated as fuck
of course skibidi toilet geometry dash had to be included in the video
13:40 congregation jumpscare
Shit i forgor
PROFILE BADGES???
Not the zoink glazers holy
I was under the impression this was a mid year for Geometry Dash because I didn't play as much, but I can't say I still think that. Especially when the lookback on 2023 started rolling around, I started to eat my words. Good year of levels and choices, and one that will be nice looking back on as the last (almost) full year before 2.2.
Wish the levels shown at the end had their title & creator in the corner of the video. There were so many that I wanna check out

I was laughing my ass off when they didn't show tidal wave when showing zoink😭 atleast they showed it for like the least amount of time during that compilation
Guitarherostyles!!!
That was awesome
While I wasn't a big fan of the new setup for awards this year because now each catagory is insainly broad (and floating outskirts got robbed because there is no more minigame award) I still think this was an insanely good year for levels and I cant wait to see what people will do with the new 2.2 editor this year.

Congrats to all the winners!
The youtuber should be guitarherostyles
LIKE TO GET ROBS ATTENTION!!  Dear Robtop,  I know that people have been spamming this in your chat, but I think that the level Tidal Wave deserves at least a rate. The Nong Song problem has been solved, and it just as visually appealing as some of the recently rated level. I am not forcing you to rate this, I am just asking you to consider it.   Sincerely, BackspaceGD
robtop awarding himself is such a robtop thing to do
GD COLONGE OUR BELOVED! 🧡🫶

ГД АВАРДЫ ПРОШЛИ!!! КАК ВАМ, ЗА КОГО ГОЛОСОВАЛИ? Мой комментарий: В нормалах я голосовал за What. В изи демонах за iSpy, так что обидно, что Change of Scene занял первое место. Хоть я в ютуберах и голосовал за Колона, но обидно, что у Мульпана меньше голосов, чем у какого-то ЭрикВанВилдермена. В экстримах я не могу решить, выбрать Edge of Destiny или Космос, но проголосовал за Edge of Destiny. И он занял первое место, а Космос второе! Насчёт того, что Бли лучший я не согласен, мне больше нравится Кивии. Хотя я с радостью проголосовал бы за Воксикета, Спутникса, Ксендера, Кулука и Фаннигейма) Вот так

2023 was such a banger for this game. On top of all the levels that released, so much more happened. This was the 10th anniversary of the game, 2.2 was released, Zoink finally got the recognition he deserved, and a hell of a lot more community related achievements. I'm super excited for what 2024 has in store for this game. Keep up the great work, RobTop and everyone else making this game possible.❤
Every time the Awards occur I am amazed by what the community has done. Every new level, every accomplishment. I see levels like Between Worlds and SayItBack and I wonder “How?” This year was no different. I think 2023 was the best year for this game.

geometry dash
Oye roptop puedo participar
@Vortrox I Never Knew you were here!
Reminder: Geometry Dash is a horizontal runner-style game developed and published by RobTop Games. The player takes the form of different entities with unique mechanics such as a cube, a ball, and a UFO. Using one-touch gameplay, the player must try to navigate through a series of interactive obstacles, movement-shifting transporters and behaviour-manipulating portals to reach the end of levels without crashing, all while listening to exciting music along the way.
Hello
And VorTrox better win best yt
If Zoink does not win I will be pissed
WE NEED LOBOTOMY LEVELS IN THIS
Hope trick wins player of the year gang👇
Best easy demon: ispywithmylittleeye (please win)

robtop where is 2.2 on Amazon fire is it coming soon what
easiest categories to guess are easy demon and best player  1: change of scene 2: ispy 3: glorious fortress  1: zoink 2: doggie 3: trick
Some of the outcomes I would prefer: Best auto level: Rhuzerv Best easy demon: Glorious Fortress Beat extreme demon: Edge of Destiny Beat player: Zoink (zZoink)
I ❤ GD
i’m not late lol

who agrees that everything but ispy needs to win 💀

Thanks to all the winners, nominees, and everyone else for making this game as fun and beautiful as possible. Without any of you, we wouldn't be where we are right now.  People work hard every day to achieve their goals. There are probably millions of creators out there working on their next project, billions trying to reach new heights.  Let's see what awaits us in the future and, I hope, see you next year!
:(
Can't wait for these awards! Can't process how big the game has gotten. Congrats Rob!
3 AM WHAT
Glorious fortress better win for easy demon. I spy is cringe from tiktok and isn’t even that good, and change of scene is overrated. We know it’s good but it isn’t better than glorious fortress
I really hope that GD colon wins for best GD YouTuber. He really deserves it!😊
Cytokinesis for best extreme demon!  That would be cool
I want kocmoc win in the best extreme
rrr
SEE YALL IN 4 HOURS!!!
Change of screne or 🍞🔫

SAVE CHILE!! 🇨🇱🙏
good luck yall
I think the background changing in Stereo Madness represents the increasing difficulty
Go zoink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You got this bro!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I truly do not care about levels below easy demon so here are my personal choices for each Easy Demon: Glorious Fortress Medium Demon: Turning Point Hard Demon: Nosotros Cosmoc Insane Demon: Crash Game Extreme Demon: Edge of Destiny Best Streamer: npesta Best Youtuber: Tride Best Video: The most infamous level Best Creator: ImMaxX1 Best Player: Zoink (obviously)
Everyone is probably voting WHAT for best hard level, But I voted The block factory
If ISpyWithMyLittleEye does not get the most votes, there's no point in living
Опять в 12 ночи?
if robtop wins the best video award it will be a legendary moment Edit: BRO I WAS RIGHT 💀

Man, best Easy Demon is STACKED this year. Can’t wait to see who wins that.

I hope kocmoc wins best extreme, will edit my reaction once the video premiers. Edge of destiny would be another great winner   Edit: edge of destiny was definitely deserved, and I’m glad kocmoc also got a lot of votes. Glorious fortress was robbed though, change of scene already got heaps of awards
