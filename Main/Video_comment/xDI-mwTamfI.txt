shame the lawn is on sand. A few weeks of use and the mounds will appear. It should be on Rolled Granite .. Sand moves .. granite don't. Sand soaks up dog Pee ..granite don't ...Sand will wash away within months. Not sure who installed it but they did not install it properly. I hope it will last as long as you expect but I doubt it if you're going to be running taking shots on goal ,,, watch that sand shift... just my own thoughts from experience with Artificial Grass. :D
He shouldn’t have got a shed and had 2 goals Instead
You make the best videos

That is probably the coolest backyard I've ever seen, your so lucky. You deserve every good thing that has happened, so keep up the great work mate, love your vidoes, and can't wait for the future vids! 👍😁
What a vid Jez please tell me where you get all of this from. Cheers mate!
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I love these vids Jeremy, keep it up mate!

Love your video since when you started,  I don't usually like, comment and subscribe to videos of others most of the  time, but since when I watched you videos, I just had to do it. Please don't stop uploading videos, that would make me sad. All your videos are just an inspiration to me, they are showing me to not stop in my dreams and maybe one day I will come meet you there. The video i love the most was when you bought a car for your mum, so one day I will be able to do that also. You liking my comment will really mean alot, because I will screenshot shot the moment. Thanks Jeremy 😊 😘😘

Nice to see the midlife crisis is going well
You should get a second goal and make the football lines on the pitch as well as a scoreboard. I think it would really be a fun way to have competitions especially if you have friends, family or the boys over.

I'm from Malaysia and I'm a big fan of jezz since 2018 cuz he inspired me to push through my limits even though I don't had any training stuff but with his motivational videos I've finally made my first homemade goal and I would like to go with the turf as well but had money issues and I hope I can  achieve that in the future...god bless you man❤
The dream 😍😍😍🔥🔥

Get bill over
Love from India ❤❤❤
Lets go jezz🔥🔥🔥
Music at 7:46?????
Do a challenge with your fiancé
From Britain’s got talent to one of the biggest football YouTuber in the world what a journey
Love it❤😂
You gotta hold a tournament with the biggest football content  creators on the pitch
awesome football pitch , keep rocking Jeremy😎
Do your most epic training
I recreated your best knuckle ball on my channel and I was just wondering if you wanted to challenge sometime or react to it maybe
the only negative about this video is it ended........excited for next video.
My dream is to be a professional basketball player! Jeremy Linch has shown me that if you never give up you can be successful. Some day you will see me Brody Seale in the NBA! Bet
Please try a bicycle free kick video
Thank you for the content lately! Keep killing it lad🙏😁
Good blesd you bro..supporting all the way from the Caribbean
Everyone wishes we were you
I remember when he was at 100k. WOW!
You should make your fence bigger
Wow broo
Does f2 freestylers have merch if so tell me and respond pls cause I want to get one and were to get it
Dad.... Milk
look nice video but i have idea, you should do like a website where you get kids to your garden but about only 10 of them and like about 2 euros a month to come and train with you like about 3 goalkeepers that will get trained with a professional goalkeeper coach and you will train about 7 children to play as players pretty sure that would be nice
Awesome!! Keep up your unbelievable work you constantly inspire me!! One other thing you used to have a small football net which you don’t use now I was wandering if you would be interested in giving it to someone less fortunate so they can train to 🙏
Imagine being Jezza's neighbour and getting that free live garden content watching from the balcony. 😂
Is it just me or is his Spider-Man shorts amazing
Keep up the good content
You don’t understand how much I wanna play football in ur garden
Can you send me some?
Jeremy you are so good and you teach me a lot you are such a legend thanks and you’re the best YouTuber
bro i want this but i cant get it :(
Is it me or are  the cones glowing?
Is ur sis a bodybuilder?
How much did the entire project cost?
Dude your so cool!!⚽️
jezza can like make anything entertaining . i think it’s because he enjoys the process so much.
What happened to the prank videos with you and bill
That is so coo
Looks sick jezza
Love from Albania bruv❤🇦🇱🇦🇱
Loved the vid bro😂❤
Top vid bro
Man tell everyone how much he spent on his item he bought yet he wonders what it is in the box. Sounds like he got gifted them for advertisement 😬
I’ve been watching the f2 for like 5 years
Swear every video he just mentions how much he spends on everything he buys, pretty embarrassing 🤦🏻‍♂️
Hi
Great quality videos, I must say you ordered the top notch equipment for training at your house. And for you to shoot on  the net.
Football ⚽ is life ⚕️
Love his energy!!!
When can I come round for a training session jezza? 😂⚽️ congrats on you being able to live your dreams 🙌🏾🙏🏾⚽️
Your sister look good till she I say hi beautiful please thank you❤️♥️
Jeremy is legend. He did this for the fans.
Do part 3 I love it bro
Your videos are so cool
So basically just you opening boxes
Jezzas the goat
Watched the whole video and loved it
you are a beast. How. are you not pro
Does the goat reply 🐐❤️
genuinely think I’d make it pro if I had this garden and equipment... jealous tbh mate
I want to improve at football, but I have no equipment etc. Any ideas for me would be great.
Brilliant content Jezz ..really looking forward to the next video of the training sesh :)
He forgot bases for the manequens

Wow I’ve just found Jeremy on YouTube and I didn’t think that accent (British accent also my accent to) would come out of his mouth I thought it would be American 😅Idk why any wha good job mate
I think what you should do next is some kind of mural all way around the pitch on the fence. Would look superb!
Who is great if you arent great💙💙💙💙💙💙

Why do yall call backyards, gardens? 🙋🏽‍♂️American
Imagine having all this.
Loving this content
Your videos are really amazing.
I miss watching u Im gonna watch u again
Bouta read 604 comments den
Remember when u had 100 k subs ure a growing sooo fast congrats
I mean, it's cool and everything, but I don't see what makes this a "professional" football pitch. A professional football pitch is a football pitch used by professionals.
When my dad tells me to go to the park.  Me: just do thus
This guy really ordered the wrong thing what a doughnut
This will be legendary
Imagine having this as your garden That would've been a dream come true
You are the best
With the wrong net you can use it by putting points on it then u have a challenge
Just imagine having that backyard
all of that made me jealous.
Oooo this cost me over 3.5k and think nothing of it☺️
When your sister has Betten thighs than sourself. F
🙌🙌
There is no way u read every comment
Can you do some challenges on you pitch
Yo Jezz there is this training thing you can get I can’t remember the name sorry but basically you stand in a circle of rebound boards and then you can go from the lowest number to the highest in the quickest time you can
You can literally play a five a side matches while can barely get three or four people on the garden
❤️
Why does he have to say the price of it at the start like just keep it to your self
i’ve been watching the f2 for years, i grew up watching them, and i’m just now learning that jez has a baller sister??????
Eh he dont have any holders for his manicane
What a unboxing video nate absolutely banger,love it
Where did u get the small goals pls 💙
Almost 1 million subs broooo
Bro your forgot to buy the ladders those are essential
Another banger after another jermey u really are smashing it 🤩👍
Can u do skill videos with ur sister
Keep ur sister in your videos she’s pretty cool
Stay strong Eriksen.  Jeg er mega stolt af og være dansker lige nu kæmpe respekt til hele det danske hold, til Eriksens familie og ham selv. Kæmpe respekt!
Damm cuz ur sis is a pro at footy
Omg 😱 this is awsome
Can u make a football video of u using the pitch
Your sister has got bigger biceps than you?
Best content u deserve at least 10mil
I want this too ,hopefully one day I can buy it aswell. Nice comtent bro
This would be a dream come through If I had a garden like this. Hope epic skills and goals will happen on it.
