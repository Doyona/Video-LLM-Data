We need the full match 😢
97 level the rock , 98  level roman reigns cody level 98 , seth rollins level 97 and undertaker level 100
The Rock
Watching this now. I think after the spear to rock, and once rock did the ☝️ before the elbow, I think now cena will end off Roman or try too when he’s done w Cody, and whoever is after Cody
I really feel like either brock or stonecold gonna help rhodes
Bro roman reigns Will Spears you  🤫🧏

Didn't even know rock was a champion again what I miss damn
Anyone here in 2026?
Bruhh Roman reigns didn’t sell Cody 2 finishers in row😂 bro just stood up like nothing happend
10:22 Micheal spoke what we were all thinking... Probably the darkest moment in WWE with uncertainty for tomorrow. Like Austins team losing and now Eric had full control tomorrow.
Cody is screw part got me
Me
Me February  16th  2025
Coolest entrance yet
They really out did themselves with this entrance. It is so peak..and Rock now having the Peoples Championship belt as an actual reminder the impact he’s had on the company in tandem with him now being on the board, reminding everyone the level he’s on anytime he returns. Rock V. 10.0 is incredible.
8:14 does cody say thank you before the rock bottom?
Who won
ROMAN REIGNS 😊❤
Always makes me chuckle when Cody clearly turns and asks Rock if he's ready before giving him the Rock Bottom on the announce table. @8:12 specifically
Seeing The Rock entrance to wrestle his first match in 11 years and maybe his final match ever will never not give me chills.
I don't know, they're trying to show excitement, but WWE isn't what it was ten years ago.
Anyone in 2025
4:29 you count out your fired😂😂😂
This was a true display of what the rock is..A school yard bully!  They didn't win anything🤨
Roman spears the rock! at 6:54😮
Idol pa nman kita kc half Filipino ka pero bat Ganon d ka lumalaban Ng patas I was so disappointed to u
Without ur belt the Rock u did not win !!!! Your not Fair to fight
they removed the full match so he prob returning soon 🤔
The Rock pop
That thumbnail tho 😂😂😂😂
The Rock loves him the spotlight. His heel persona is just him in real life
The Rock was channeling “The Final Boss” (Black Adam really) but Roman speared the “Peter Griffin” out of him!! 😂
10:57 end🙁
Cody is the best player
No
10:04 ACKNOWLEDGE THE FINAL BOSS☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽
4:57 Seth Rollins and cold Rhodes WINS 🎉🎉🎉
I hate Roman  reigns  and The rock  so much
The ref coughing The Rock: YOU'RE FIRED!

The rock 💪💪🔥
5:01 Cody Rhodes was just fueled with rage,malace and his anger during that Cross Rhodes
Honestly was expecting a better entrance for Rock....man if they would've used his Attitude Era Intro . 🔥🔥🔥
Wrestlemania Xtra Large
Roman Reigns is no longer the same 🥲
When cody pinned Roman, the ref counted to 3 how is the match still going on?
I smell Hot Garbage😭🤣
Did the rock change his theme song?
The rock is dirty player
You’d think with how good this wrestlemania was the crowd would be louder and more engaging
10:00 that's probably why the Undertaker showed up on night 2
Rocks a goat. He was of course more athletic bck in the attitude era, but his entertainment is always there
Rocky shall never be booed🔥👆🏾☝🏾
the rock is the best
Imagine how big your ego needs to be to came up with a fake/own “championship”
Me gusto mucho the rock roman reigns vs Cody rhodes Seth Rollins
You can tell the crowd eruption was recorded look at all the fans putting their thumbs down it's because they don't want to see these older superstars they want to see who they have been watching growing up they don't want to see Goldberg the rock hulk hogan stone cold those are some of my wrestling hero's but this new generation do not like those guys basically because they don't know who they are or don't care to know who they are because this is a different era
I still don’t get this match why never combine titles had reigns face rock & Rhodes different nights
But after when Cody won the championship, the rock said mine and your story is just beginning
A hate cody
6:59 the rocks face 😂😂😂😂😂😂
i didn't know they actually used his Hollywood theme! this is cool!
Wow
Omg
The 🩸 line vs Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins in a tag team match at wrestle maina
I just got the undertaker hint before the people’s elbow
That's the slow elbow
Ngl even tho i was there, the crowd had no energy or nothing...
The rock funny 😂
Is it just me or does Roman look different like face wize not just because of his hair I mean compare him to his match against la knight
The Rocks entrance took longer than Takers and he won. No wonder Taker showed up the next night he was pissed!
Where's my manners double pedigrees 💪
8:57 that belt whip brought flash backs when we used to wrestle after Mom yelled to settle down…😅😂😂😂
❤❤❤❤❤
The rock is tv gold
If it was the attitude era  If ya smeeellalalaalalal
That’s the Easter egg to win taker was going to choke slam him . He did the undertaker thing slid his finger across his neck.
They should’ve had the black Adam lightning ball
I just noticed at 8:13, that Cody gives The Rock a vocal cue and asked him “Ready?” And then proceeds to Rock Bottom him through the table. I love wrestling so much man!
Cody and Seth real winner... The rock and Roman feek winner (not real) cheating
Still came back to this 🔥
لااله الاالله محمدرسول الله
Was this a no disqualification match or what cuz I’m confused
the rock is radagon, and the undertaker is malenia...
If you wants to send me money I should escape
It feels it’s bloodline tag team match
When I see this, I think of it to be Marvel vs DC. Think about it, Cody Rhodes is Captain America and Seth Rollins can be Iron Man. On the other side, Roman Reigns is Batman and Rock can be Superman.
foi bonito o teatro, adorei
6:50 OOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAA 6:55 ROMAN SEARED THE ROCK 7:15 PEDDAGRIES 7:18 1 2 7:20 NO
8:14 THE ROCK BOTTOM TROUGH THE TABLE 8:20 LOOK OUT, SPEAR THROUGH THE BERACADE
The Rock bottom looks devastating af 😂
seriously the level of acting here is so poor. cody rhodes should be ashamed 😂
Dusty would be proud..cody is getting better by the yearnd respect too the rock in his 50s looking good and moving good remember hogan in his 50s
بقلدش
Before he hit the peoples elbow I didn't realize he worded "this is for you Mama Rhodes"..... He was up in his villain bag and I loved every second of it
Bro when Cody pined Roman at 5:09 it was three counts
🇺🇸 vs 🇼🇸
When my dad saw that Roman reigns spear the rock my dad was like the rock deserves that spear from Roman reigns
half the video is the rocks entrance... clearly the editing team looking for a raise lmfao
❤❤
Take it easy mr rock
This is the greatest match I ever watched
9:56 - I should've realized it before, but Rock doing the throat slash may have been a subtle hint to Undertaker appearing on Night 2.
😂 2:03 2:11
😂 2:03

I like when the camera in the back and and when it gets up it moves 2:29

The legend is back 😮 the rock
5:59 Is Roman Reigns Trying to Break Cody’s Neck?
Wooow!!!!

Roman Herro The Arab ❤❤
Cody changed his dad?
Is Vinny still in control?
I love the Rock, if you count you're fired.
Base de datos
Roman's face after spearing the Rock left me weak.😂😂
The entrances were way too long
This is funny but a great match
Yessss we saw romannn ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️😊 aka ex tribal cheif
Why is one of the best matches in the year the worst crowd of thhe year
I saw that the referee hit the ground 3 times
6:50 this would’ve been a insane Wrestlemainia moment quick time event in 2k14
Best wrestlemania match
CODY CODY CODY CODY CODY CODY
10:00
Best Westlemania I've ever seen, finally Roman Reigns managed WWE Universal again
Dwayne Johnson did The Rock Bottom on Cody Rhodes when he slamming on the ground to try to become Undisputed WWE Universal championship 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Its not the rock, the final boss gimmick is Cringe
Iklannya kurang banyak
Barf. Completely not watchable.
Cool😂
Obv they are all older but is it just me or is it all lookin a bit sluggish?
I'm 28 😂😂😂 seeing the rock telling the refs not to count or he's fired just brings back so many memories lol. I can just feel the fakeness but it's my child hood😂😂😂. It's just hillarious. It's so on par with who he is. By the way the rock is my goat, followed by cena , stone cold, Andre , Rick flair, under taker HHH , orton and that man himself lesnar. That doubl pedigree was sick and disrespectful. Mama rohdes! You look at your son. Hahaha the goat.
It's crazy that the Rock intensity is way above the rest. For some reason he can wrestle way better than them is crazy.
My biggest pet peeve in wrestling is something Roman does constantly  he looks up at the refs hands so he csn try and kick out last possible second   Problem is when your eyes are looking up there and this is for any wrestler i already know your kicking out .     And you thinking your make higher tension i think alot would agree with me that it does the opposite
Roman went to the lex Luger school of selling   scream like a banshee when you get hit with ... pretty much anything
Imperio alemán
The rock i roman reigns❤❤❤❤🏦
The millions of the rocks Fans💯
I actually had stopped watching Romans matches since he cheated the chosen one at clash at the castle bt Cody gave the wwe crowd a suprise😲😲😲

THE ROCK TRIED BETTING UP THE Referee😂
Cody Rhodes you suck❌🚯
Csk lose😅
I will never forgive you for black Adam
Great main event 🔥
the rock intro  are insane   ahhahahahah
Dont disrespect Mama Rhodes
5:08That counted THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IT!
Highlights: half of them are Rock’s entrance
this match was better then the championship lol i just think rollins was over used for mania reigns title end had to many ppl involved i still think the title should’ve never been combined and had reigns face both of them on different nights especially to make up the cm punk injury
Bro the rock bottom into the announce table and the spear into the barricades was legendary I was screaming out of my lungs this match was insane
I have all the figures
Reigns actually looked best in this match with his execution. Unexpected
What a classic as of late tag team match
Haha the way the ref counted that double pin 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cody Rhodes & Seth "Freakin" Rollins vs. Rock & Roman Reigns: if it were possible I would change Seth Rollins for Logan Paul I see it much better
The Rock cheated
I hate the Rock
Imo this is one of the greatest tag matches ever
When you speared The Final Boss The betrayal get started.
Bloodline Rules match
It sucks that the first 4:15 minutes is just the Rock's entrance
I Like Naomi Bianca Belair and Jade Cargill and Baily and I also Like Dwayne Johnson and Cody Rhodes
10:04 "Whats up brothers!☝"
i think even a blind person can tell that was fae as hell but it really brought back all the fans to the WWE we loved and grew up to 😍😍😍😍😍😍
The endgegner the rock when he coming then it’s game over for all other superstars
6:59 ROCK FACE😂😂😂
Get up
When the Rock hit that man with the belt smh.........took me back to my childhood 😅😅
Damn I just heard Roman got cancer and if you look in his face you can see he don’t feel good

Get uppp
Wait, real highlights 🔥🔥 I can’t lie this my favorite Mania match all time 😭🤷🏽‍♂️
95% of wwe is fake they not actually hitting each other
rematch!!
Everybody secretly wanted the rock to win
they missed the opportunity to have the rock raise roman's hand like he did in the 2015 rumble which was also in philly
4:28 CHEATER! CHEATER! CHEATER! CHEATER! CHEATER! CHEATER! CHEATER! CHEATER!
Geez, the ROCK is the really TOUGH😂
x
Stupid ads not letting me watch this battle
Cody the lad carried you In promos pinned you night one

Keren the rock
The rock is one of the few that when turn hill, people still cheer lol 😂
Bro if cody fans cry
Man the rock isn’t he same anymore lol
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii😂😂😂😂
Rock clocked in at 285 lbs. At almost 52, and moving like he did in this match. Dude is a monster.
*LIKE THIS COMMENT IF YOU LIKE WWE*
You see Cody Rhodes whisper to the rock right before he slammed him in the table with the rock bottom lol got to do better home boy camera was right on you 😂😂🤦‍♂️
Man The Rock came back swinging for the WWE. He came back not only as a seasoned action moviestar he came back with the most electrifying story arch to save the falling WWE. Much needed.
Bro the rock did everything
Wwe MOVIE FIGHT The Real FIGHT UFC
Pop looked like that was more hood than a pot of grits 😢😂❤❤❤❤❤
Blodline roman reighns best and dwayne
You count you're fired!
The rock still sold it those spear like 20 years ago when Goldberg spear him😂
6:50
10:00 undertaker foreshadowing??
Roman is a weak dude😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
The guy at 10:27 😂
Can’t believe I really used to think this was real
You count, you’re fired! 😮😂😂
Please What title is the rock holding
love comes from Vietnam, the rock ❤❤❤❤❤
People are saying this sport is fake, they're such a loser
Rocks reaction is crazy
Good job rock and Romanians
Doing each other finisher Is so trash anymore
the face that the rock makes after the spear hilarious! 🤣🤣but this was a great match before the final showdown between the two main event 😎🙌🙌
Remember what the rock did in Hawaii with the orphan lol
דה רוק אתה אכי טוב
He did the ol skool rock bottom iykyk 😂
Bro this was rigged
Wo is a sub
Man i don't watch WWE but this is so hilarious and entertaining 🤣
Who else saw that 1:41👀
The rock's neck is thiccccc!!!
9:54 that angry dad is hilarious 😂😂🤣
Das ist einfach mega
Really it was unfair to Cody Rhones rock just pulled the official out of the match
Dwayne is changing career to career and I like it
The Rocks face like he needs to take a dump after he got speared 😂😂😂😂😂
Just watched ufc300 and it was 1000x better than this bunch grown men play-fighting in undies 😂
a perfect representation of the WWE these days all bark and no bite
The Rock at nearly 52 looks in unbelievable shape and considering he hasn't wrestled in over 10 years, what a great performance he put on. Always the ultimate professional.
The rock Is nad.he Unit with Román an solo sikloa.traidor judas.thr Is Judas.
The rock yelling at Cody’s mom is so funny 😂
Love the people’s elbow gets a huge reaction all these years 🙌🏼
This funny
Rock needs to be back by the end of the year
After the sound of the whip from the Rock on Cody:  Michael Cole: did you h-e-a-r that?  Corey Graves: I felt it from about 12 feets away! My Lord 😂😂 That was gold 😂😂
Whats that title the rock was holding?
العراق 🇮🇶🇮🇶🇮🇶 🐅🐅
I wasn't able to watch WrestleMania 40. Demand and Paper-View are the reasons I stopped watching WWE in the 2000's.
The rock awesome great good going
que recuerdos cuando creíamos que esto era real, ahora se siente raro verlo pero igual lo disfruto por la nostalgia :')
8:57
"the fact that Dwayne is in the main event at WrestleMania and I'm not makes me sick"  Cm punk
Good the rock
The punches look fake until Roman made a sound
4:30 you count you are fired   I am the rock and I don’t f*ck around 😂😂😂😂😂😂
People Said the Rock can't wrestle after 8 years. He look like he is doing very well to me...
Haha the rock❤😂 roman spear the rock
Back in my day, the crowd was lit up with camera flashes when the rock was doing the people's elbow
Jose😂
6:58  The face of the rock 😂😂
mansome
who the litle man chody rodes ? 😅
Song?
You count you fire 😂😂😂😂 the rock ain’t joke
THERES ONLY A COUPLE WRESTLERS WHO CAN GET ME BACK TO WATCHING WWE
Boring game😮‍💨😮‍💨
Boring game.....😮‍💨
What The Rock was able to accomplish these last few months and actually putting a really good performance in the ring shows why he’s the real 🐐
Love Paul saying noooooooooo! Great touches
Bro wwe just hit 101 million subscribers
I absolutely love Roman. Nobody can ever change my mind. I'm not a fan of the other... He really isn't irrelevant... still
The Rock yelling at Cody's mom is probably the most unrealistic thing here
True Hollywood Rock fans recognise the head turn with the beat drop 1:36. Absolute fire
6:57 Rock in as much agony as lebron when he drives the lane and gets "fouled".
Hats off to the rock for staying in shape all these years. Consistency is everything 🐂 9:56
The best workout Johnson had in 10 years
Love watching The Rock wrestle takes me back to being a kid
اللهم صلي وسلم على نبينا محمد اللهم صلي وسلم على نبينا محمد اللهم صلي وسلم علي نبينا محمد اللهم صلي وسلم على نبينا محمد اللهم صلي وسلم علي نبينا محمد اللهم صلي وسلم على نبينا محمد اللهم صلي وسلم علي نبينا محمد اللهم صلي وسلم على نبينا محمد

I didn’t like it tbh
He’s almost 52 and still got it
Great to see the great one back in the ring! Hopefully not for the last time! 🙂
Only because Of cheating
The Rock is the single most overrated wrestler in history next to Triple H.
Where was Seth Rollin???
The rock just lost a fan 👎

Questi samoani vogliono vincere sempre con i magheggi e scorrettezze the rock e romana reign persone antisportive dovrebbero esserci regole più sportive e regolari basta con le scorrettezze
The Rock should call himself the billion dollar man he's almost worth a billion ☺️😚
Exceso de Sexo!!!!!🔫
lol this is hilarious Cody Rhodes slamming The Rock through anything is an oversell
The Final Boss
While people compared Cody vs Roman to the Avengers, I compared Cody/Seth vs Roman/Rock to Kong/Godzilla vs Scar King/Shimo.
Did anyone notice Rock’s mom’s face when he turned to Cody’s parents and said “look at your son”?
10:26 “ after we done spent all that money👨🏾‍🦳
Roman reigns please don't retire😢
❤ nice
😂😂
The Philly crowed Sucked!
Naah this Final Boss Rock was Boring Bring back Hollywood Rock❤

Love you Jesus Christ 💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟 Amen 💓💓😘💕🙏❤️💗
Multiple ads, 10sec apart, is absolutely stupid. Lesson learned: never click the official videos 👌
So jarring. The video is full of ads I think I have to get YouTube premium
Did not watch WWE for long,  The Rock really a legend
Seem like attitude era is coming back ❤ The Rock the best then and the best now and ever ❤❤❤❤
Yooo!!! Always love the rock
Cody got the last laugh 😂

Rock face after getting speared was legendary!😂
Cody got screwed!😂
That Rock Bottom was clean af!😂
Cody "CRYBABY" RHODES ROCK BOTTOM "THE FINAL BOSS" THE ROCK!😂
This the greatest match of all time WrestleMania 40. "The Final BOSS" The Rock & ROMAN REIGNS vs SETH "FREAKING" ROLLIN! & CODY "CRYBABY" RHODES!😂

😂😂😂😂
The King
What a less deserved victory.
the rock as a bad guy heel again,  LAME
The Macho Man should've ran in there and saved Cody. Second row he was.
That was so bad, the timing of the moves ,, swear they think the audience have a below average I.q.   The 2 handed count by the ref was comedy gold though
Good match 💯match of the night
I told myself I’m done watching wwe wrestling, but then the rock decided to be part of wrestmania this year
6:55 The Rock Sold That Spear
The rocks entrance was over hyped but when that bell rang for the undertaker got me amped my 12 year old self came out was soo excited!!!! The dead man is the final boss!!!!!!
For those of us that know how effective a tight guillotine choke is, we know you don't last that long
Cody and seth ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Spear and Double Pedigree
I used to think that it was sort of real looking, but then I remembered I was nine when I thought that
The amount of talent in 1 ring in this day and age is absolutely incredible. The history and chemistry between all these superstars is absolutely indescribable
The rock AND Arnold are both 5’11. The rock MIGHT be 6 1 in shoes.
Fanstatic main event match
fake
Is the ring BIGGER?
1:07 ❤❤
Congratulations to the final boss on being engaged
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
roman won this match all this to lose at a one on won with cody when he could ask the bloodline to help him
6:51 ROMAN after want attack CODY RHODES but... 6:55 THE target its ROCK/ TARGER WRONG
Bruh that intro is out TThis world way better then all his other intro hands Dwn with the fire bruma  🐂 geesh 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Dos veces hubo lucha roman reigns vs cody
Bruhh even Roman was abt to crack up after The Rock's reaction 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Was kinda obvious The Rock and Roman was gonna win, since they need to make Cody win against all Odds! But great match.
That move of of crossing his finger across his neck(rest in peace) is what summoned the demon of death valley to wrestlemania
Since when the rock became champion?
🇿🇦
Cody cannot defeat roman reigns.i don't believe in Roman reigns loose.
Man Dwayne johnson loves attention, kinda of sad really 😂
I don't believe in Roman reigns     lost.
If you count, you're fired😅
Damn I never thought I'd be watching WWE again 😂
AIR Rock Entrance Lmaoo
The Rock was the x factor in this whole thing as an absolute gem that if any of us had any doubt in his taker or Hogan years at 52 as once the youngest main event mania performer ever.....he shut that down with 40 minutes of work 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Rock jus make his own title to pack or what I’m lost somebody fill me 😂
What title is the rock holding
That Hollywood Rock theme is perfection
After all these years, The Rock still looking good,even better like he never aged 💪
10:27 let’s be real. Cody’s mama not caring what happens to Cody. She got some bbc beside her. 😅time for a new kingdom she says 😂
I laughed 😂😂😂😂
كم من غبي و غبية إشترو تذاكر ليشاهدو تمثيلية و مسرخية مثل هاته
so it happened?
The Rock felt it,  the Goldberg flashback!!
Ngl I don’t watch wrestling but every once in awhile I’ll peep a match or two and it’s a blast everytime
Seth Rollins: "Did we just lose ?"
Nightcap with Unc & Ocho brought me here. Now I have to start watching to keep up with the conversation 😅
thank god we win
so gay
We needed the rubber chicken at the end of this match! Where was the gawddamn rubber chicken?? 😭😭
Why is you tube forwarding the whole show?Sebi nah my data
Werbung fuckt so ab
The fact they had prime as a sponsor disrespectful and a joke
So Rhodes had 2 matches?
Loba iklan gblok
Old wrestlers know how to carry wwe over their shoulders
This WM was amazing, great storyline BUT all the results from both nights were too obvious. But it was time WWE finally gave the people what they wanted to see. I think this has to be in the top 5 best WM ever.
"American Home Shield..."  Who saw that ?
Awesomeness!!  👊😎✊😎👍😎♈🍁♈
That spear Roman Reigns hit the Rock with hurt the Rock's SOUL! 😂
Aew founder wins the championship.  Aew!!!
I love how its an 11 minute video and more than 4 of that is the rocks entrance 😂
Recuerdo que antier mí hermano y yo queríamos que the rock y roman reigns ganaran la lucha a pesar de ser del team cody y seth, pero claro eso lo hacíamos porque creíamos que sí the rock y roman reigns ganaban esa lucha entonces en la noche 2 de wrestlemania 40 (ayer) tendría más oportunidades de ganar el título cody rhodes, y ya ven lo que pasó... 🤗
CM PUNK
I’ve been out of it for a good minute, so we don’t like the rock anymore?
Holy eff is this pathetic 😂😂
This is for you mama rhodes im dead😂😂😂😂😂
Roman Reigns is out
It is one of The Greatest Tag Team Matches in WrestleMania history 👍
Before i like roman and rock now both are cheaters
The Rocks selling is totally underrated. I always thought HBK was best seller. The Rock is up there too
If those lightning were real, most of those people there will be fried
The only thing I didn't like was that you burned the second night 2 But the match is beautiful, frankly, wonderful
2014 rock wouldve solo them
Ah yes gasoline by the weeknd goes great with watching 2 tanks massacre each other
Great Theme
funniest wm of all time. THATS MY HOT TAKE.
outta hereeeee
La ww ya da pena asco i lástima Yano sorprende que agán trampa .. volverá a servir cuando no agan trampa
I’m real glad that Cody Rhodes is doin good for himself. Was always a fan of his father and brother back in the day. And glad that Roman is all healthy again. BUT, this is literally the most I’ll watch of the new product. What did they use, about 30 finishing moves total? lol I just can’t get into the high flying, choreographed ballet with dozens of finishing moves that don’t finish anyone.
So does bloodline rules go
This match gets half a star overall, Roman Cody and Seth get 3 stars for individual performances but Rock get 0 stars for imitating Vince in the worst way and not being able to sell it at all. Who writes this garbage? Are we still in high school or are we adults, because they act like bloody nose freshmen more in the WWE. Pathetic, and I'm not entertained.
Aew > Wwe
Qué capacidad tienen los yanquis para hacer estos espectáculos
They really pushing prime for events
That peoples elbow was soo fire
Cody and Seth should have won 👎👎
The Rock saying "bang bang" while dropping that people's elbow on Cody was hilarious trolling!
Scripted
The crowd in Perth was louder than this
Is that what roman reigns wears to wrestle
The theme switch up for Rocky was...ELECTRIC
Roman fanboys you all can quit now 😂
Roman reign never win without cheat
Bye wwe
why the rock doesn't take off his elbow pads when doing people's elbow finishing
Rock turns on Roman tomorrow
Roman lost
wrestling has gotten so bad lol this is so pathetic
cody won
Cody won.
Rock swollen but he didn't look electric fineing to me anymore
I miss the rock sideburn hair
Congratulations Cody!!
Kev hart shoulda been the ref
I haven't watched in years why is the presentation so ugly, the in ring prime advertisement the LED "security" rails it's hard to watch its just so much thrown at you Vs how it was
Cody won. Suck it, Roman fanboys. 🤣🤣🤣
The Rock tells the referee he will fire him if his team didn't win? Is that the best story line the Rock could come up with, copying what MVP did on TNA? The Rock's grand parents would be so disappointed. Rock, go back to acting, but before you do, bring Pat Patterson back from the dead to give WWE a new wrestling match ending.
That was awful whats the point of having all these john cenas and undertakers helping they are nothing to do with the story line that was awfulllllll
AEW is trash WWE is just horrible. Maybe it’s time for dudes to grow up and realize wrestling now a days is trash
😮 After Roman Reigns Hits The Rock With That Hellatious Spear Roman Looks Like He Jus Saw A Ghost While The Rock's Face Is Priceless 😆.
First entrance got Godzilla chargin up for a surge 🤣🤣🤣⚡️⚡️⚡️
ZzZZZZZ  🥱🥱🥱😴😴😴
I remember when people used to have their hands up cheering. Not holding a phone. Sad world
Did Roman reigns win against seth rollins
Wow i didnt order wrestlemania 40 but did  the  philly crowd suck the whole night
C'mon CODY HAD THIS MATCH.. I'M SICK ..
Here comes stone cold
This just means Cody is more than likely winning.
Roman getting more defined
The Rock’s Championship Belt Looks Better Than ANY WORLD OR WWE Championship Belt WWE has put out in the Last 15 Years.
IMO The Rock should have been disqualified for threatening the ref with his job if he counted out him or Reigns yet he had no problem allowing the ref to count out Rhodes!
When Roman was going to win then why was Rock called?People, you are an idiot.
This is why IMO, The Rock is truly The Great One. Out of all the Legend WM return matches; The Rock (and Trish Stratus) has been the only one ive seen that still looks like he's never left! (No offense to these legends but) Now the other guys in their recent WM matches: Undertaker, Stone Cold, etc.. unfortunately they showd their age... Rock still looks like he can get back on Active Roster!
2 members of shield roman reigns and seth rollins brother vs brother....
The rock and roman should have destroyed the piss out of those two goofs especially the goof with the jobber title,the title for the number two's,the loser bracket champion,as well as when he did with cody.
The face expressions @ 10:25 😂😂😂😂
The Rock You Count ill fire you 😂
The crowd stinks
Seeing a Goldust return for tomorrow
Two crossroads and then getting up? Wrestling not what it once was
I feel bad when the rock got speared 🥲 6:54
I feel bad when the rock got speared 🥲
Legendary entrance for the great One!!!!!
Ik knew it why I choose roman&Rock😂
Cody won. The rock had to roman and the rock had to cheat to win
Rock is getting older...he is moving slower..LOVE SEEING HIM!!!!
The match was the rock vs the ref 😂😂😂😂
The ROC the truth gotta give it to em shouts out goes to all of em😊
I liked it when the Rock done  the people's elbow and then won
That was so predictable i shoulda bet on it but I'm not a betting person ha
This is amazing. Every one did their job, pulled their weight and the rock looked like he never left.  And “Mama Rhodes.. you look at your son” is absolutely sick 😆😂… what a Classic
Doubke pedigree was a cool thing and rock kicking out makes sense, but are we gonna ignore that that makes 4 finishers hit on roman and he kicked out? Make it make sense man
Sienpre le dan el gane a romang
This made Cody Rhodes even more popular!😎👍⭐✴
Which belt is the rock holding
The rock n romàn cheat just like judgement dày
It’s still crazy to see The Rock back in action in the ring after all these years.
Hi
That was A hell of a rock bottom
If you count your fired, I need 15 seconds of Prime in frame to get paid.
And it looked like the ref was doing the work at 7:19 💀
Why is roman reigns apparently related to everyone and the way rock was screaming 7:13
Rock wins MICHEAL : "CODY is screwed 😂
Again only won cause of cheating, rock and Roman are overrated babies
good evening twin he needs to win and Real you be champion❤🇺🇸🤬with for me Cody Rhodes win
8:11 The American Nightmare Cody Rhodes Rock Bottom Through The Announce Table 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
WWE needs to get rid of the kissing cousins!! The PROTECTED ENTITLED PARTTIMER roman & the WORTHLESS POS FRUITY PEBBLES BOTH SHOULD BE BEAT BLOODY. FRUITY PEBBLES pulling strings scaring the ref even WORSE giving his daughter who was USELESS as a manager the boss job of NXT!!! She couldn't handle faking a managers job!!! Put her in control of NXT...TOTALLY STUPID!!! ONLY REASON SHE IS GM OF NXT IS THE FRUITY PEBBLES LOSER
☝️☝️
Calling it, triple h will stop the rock in this bloodline rules match and Cody will finish the story.
Rock cheating follow 👎. Romance cheating  👎. Down down
Rock took 20 years off and came back looking like Batista.
Good match.
The look on the face of both Rock and Roman after that spear 😂😂😂😂
The rock ant nothing but a piece trash and get run over by a monster truck and paul haman is their quideness conseal who solves your problems jimmy uso cant fight he is bult like a. brick wall and get run over by a pickup truck solo is a elfent who gets run over by a garbage truck
The Rock is a better wrestler in ring or goldberg?
Seth works hard for raw and let roman fight the entire roster ant nothing buta big garbage truck who goes through a brick wall finda new place to fight
i watched the whole match and it was so unfair! i searched u p how much refs get paid and honestly i would have gotten fired then let the rock win 😒
The rock socks the bloodline socks go to aew don't have to cell with the bloodline garbge let Roman and rock fight the raw and smacksown you jabraanes
The ROCK عمك وعم عيلك 🎉
One thing Vince did have right was not having advertisement all over making the ring look ugly.
Rock saved wwe
Seen many crowds that crowd was super dead
Seth was carrying this match bro
That ref should've given Dwayne the finger for talking to him like that I don't care who he is or claims to be.
That stare down between rock and reigns was the tale that rock turns on him tonight
Jesus, the bloodline story line is getting old. Time to switch the storyline
This match is bull yall giving roman to much of a advantage
Question about the day I will have no idea 💡 I will get it to get a while 😭😀 I have no time 😭 I have no clue if you want me what time you get 3:16
The rock forsure made wwe cool again!💯
Less go🎉
That crossroads move is pure trash, just like Cody Rhodes wrestling.
Naaaa román otra vez que aburrido.... basura
Pointless Match Just Done To Get Rock In Ring Shape For SummerSlam And WrestleMania Next Year
Nobody cheered at the end 😂
The rock Cheater Until Cody grab his leg Román at count 3 Cody win there is evidence
Let's see .... Cody is what, 0 for a million against Reigns and Rock now. So pathetic.
🤮🤮🤮🤮
😮😮😅😅😂
Is Seth bisexual ?
Codi ❤❤❤❤
We are witnessing history and I’m happy to be alive during this 🥹🔥🔥this was epic
Loving this Final Boss For the Great One 🐂
Wwe has no idea
10:11 THIS ONE IS FOR YOU MAMA RHODES 10:17 PEOPLE'S ELBOW 10:20 COVER BY THE Rock 10:21 CODY IS... SCREWED
everything saw good but this crowd was one of the worst ever...stupid philly fans
I've watch wwe 32 years since wrestlemania 8 if Cody wins title I quit. I'm sorry. I agree sick of roman but Cody not the guy. He's star dust. Has to be some one else. Wwe will regret making Cody next big thing. He's no rock or stone cold or hhh or Shawn Michaels or hulk hogan or John cena. Cody is more like the miz or samy zan or Kevin owens not face of wwe
People taking any chance to trash Philly & their fans, the crowd is about as normal as any other ppv & manias. You guys are just ridiculous.
Its so rigged
This is kinda dead i cant lie
The Rock 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Are you seriously deleting my comments just because I said The Rock has that championship to boost his Ego?
By Cody are is calling you
Cody is winning tonight
Seth proved his worth in this match
That curbstomp to Romans face was badass
just like triple h said  man I live for this😭
Cody Rosh vs The Rock Romen WM40
why he kinda look like ruPaul with those sunnies
❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow rock came out to the belts of his own
The rock pulling the ref out the ring when Cody almost won had me pissed 😡🤣
This is not making any sense anymore Roman reigns has been given so much favor in this industry and is not making any sense anymore even the past legends in this business didn't get this kind of favor his match fixing is getting much and nothing is been done about it seriously am really disappointed with WWE
It will still be happing in. 2099
Ts looks so botched
What wwe match should I do next
crowd was weak. They didn't care about cody, rock, or anything. Maybe they'll care tonight when the glass shatters??
Brilliant match- can’t say the same for the crowd’s enthusiasm
Cody will get stupid reigns tonight
So ridiculous wrestling has become..thank God I was around for the golden years
Just like I said in another video Cody shouldn't even BOTHER coming out tomorrow night and who and when is Roman going to lose the belt to as this is STARTING to turn people away from WWE!
Ik hes the peoples champ but he dont need to come with a title lmao
Acknowledge Tribal chief and The final boss ☝
It's not surprising to see that Roman Rains (Cheated) his way to Victory (Again).
Hmmm..... Knowing none from bloodline can handle a real match without cheating stinks.
The most electrifying move in sports entertainment today the bloodlines elbow
rocks face in the thumbnail lmaoooo
That brahma belt is cold
What is the need of this Mach
That entrance cost more than Tony Khan’s coke habit
The Rock looked fresh. He hasn't missed a beat!
WWE just aint what it used to be.
WTF happened to this WWE too much boring now.Roman Reigns should go to UFC and ask usos or The Rock for helping him to win.
Omg the roch is crazzy
Cody took the pin last night so he's going to beat Roman and become the new WWE UNIVERSAL CHAMPION. Rollins didn't take the pin because he's most likely going to lose to Drew tonight. I think we're going to have a HUGE turn tonight. Either Cody or Rollins or possibly both will turn heel in a double turn where the bloodline, Rock and Roman, turn face. Triple H has said that the ending of Night 2 will be a game changer and one of the biggest moments in WWE history, but would Cody just beating Roman fit that statement? Would Priest cashing in his MITB fit that statement? I don't believe either of them are game changing. Obviously Rollins getting hurt last night and leading to his defeat tonight could instantly send him to the dark side and cause him to turn on Cody but I don't think Roman retaining fits Triple H's statement. The only conclusion that I think is fitting is for Cody to turn heel and Roman to finally turn face in a double turn that would be bigger than WrestleMania 17, which also included The Rock. An even better conclusion would be for Seth, Cody, and Jey Uso all tuning heel and the Bloodline turning face because that would be a complete game changer and the greatest double turn ever. I have no idea how they do that but I do think it could be done especially with The Rock included.
No se le vio a seth rollins en esa pelea pareciera que Cody peleó solo 😅😅
this is awesome moment 6:50 this is awesome moment 8:14
i like how rock finished the match with the peoples elbow whens the last time that was used to win a match and honestly i thought the would cheat besides the belt
Cody and Seth are the best
Man! Why didn't I know about this fight? 😢😅
What belt rock is holding
The game was incredible. But the crowd was meh like there were seriously "This is Awesome" moments that the crowd didn't even show for example Roman spearing Rock that was intense. Cody Rhodes rock bottoming The Rock on the announcer table or Roman spearing Rollins through the barricade. Game was fire so many moves and kick outs and I kind of wanted Rollins and Rhodes to win but The Rock is my favorite of all time so it was nice seeing him back in the ring. He sure had the referee hanging by a thread. Great game overall!
☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻
Rock gonna fire the ref tonight and in comes special ref stone cold WHAT!
I have never seen such a disgraceful audience😐🤦🏻‍♂️
WWE is becoming so boring as of now, Roman holding that title for decades is really unacceptable. Thank God for Samy he dethroned the ring general
All the bloodlines are cheats thay only win by cheating
Bro that double pedigree moment was a thing of beauty, even with (maybe especially because) of the double kick outs.   I think what also made this match so refreshing and good was the lack of involvement from the Bloodline
Too many stipulations in these matches. I'm confused 🤔
I miss old wwe wrestling it just don’t feel the same because Roman reigns ruined wrestling
I cannot actually believe how bad the crowd is.
Anyone know what is that title belt Rock brings with him to the ring?
It's pretty obvious that The Rock will give his spear revenge this night, they cannot let Cody lose this title shot, they've build everything for him and the end of the bloodline.
Seth Rollins sucka who tf told him that finishing stomp looked good like that shi is the weakest finisher
wrestlemania xl is no longer on demand 😂 we know how it ends
Amazing match. Rocky hasnt lost a step 👏👏
Wtf rollins😂
All that cheating is getting so old. I hope WWE loses a lot of money until they make the matches fair instead of somebody helping Roman reigns to retain his title Every pay-per-view event is getting so old. We all know he should have lost that title a long time ago if it was one on one fights instead of cheating. So lame I definitely will not be spending no more money on any WWE events. Whoever is making those storylines needs to be fired so lame and boring ASF.
For the love of all that is sacred, please get rid of all the Prime advertising all over the ring.
4:29
For some reason...I still feel like Cody gonna win regardless tho plz no more rematches give other people the opportunity
The Bloodline Wins Again
Cool
2 Chains and the albino looking sista in the front row with Wale!
The Final Boss makes the Tribal Chief look like an underling.
Even Paul Heyman was shocked by that belt whip
it sucks because we know roman is gonna win tonight
Cody, like your pop said , It’s hard times daddy!! You got this!!
WWE  is not like it used to be I don’t no how people watch this stuff or even pay money to watch on tv , 80 and 90’s were the best years
Let's take a moment to realize how ripped The Rock is
Anybody else notice the red almost giving Roman the wrong belt 😅 at the end.
Imagine stone cold coming in the end and gives rock a stunner
A true champion becomes champion with no help
Don't forget Damian still has the MIB
Bloodline rules works both ways.
R-Truth is 52 years old and still looks snd wtestles like hes in his early 30s and doesn't seem yo be slowing down
The chatting is much
lucky u.. i got 7 old godly scammed 2 fireworks  1 mech bunny 21 utc...
OMG the spears 😂👌
Well its pretty much a garentee that the rock is gonna screw over roman to set up their match for next year also expect damein preist to cash in on cody so then jugdement day can hold all the championships like bloodline did last year or the year before
wane the rok watch Roman 😂😂😂😂😂
Every match was decent. This match being great. The uso match was horrid. They might not have it yet to be separated and do singles.
ail1000😊😢
Glad i didn't pay per view...dude cant defend his belt one on one...paper champ
😅😮😮
1000 😢
9:00 the wreight belt spot 😂😂😂 he hit roman
My prediction, Cody will win the title, Bloodline become broke from the inside, it's just to make an epic story for Cody. Nice show, 😂😂😂😂
No saben cómo jubilar a la Roca y lo lllaman de nuevo para ser el mamón de Reingsy sus sobrinos  hasta cuando WWE seguirá con lo mismo como las películas de la Roca cada vez son peores no ie wueda otra que volver ya es hora Cody Rodes debe ser campeón no co Rollins le ganan ya me aburre esta histotia
Reigns is a limited wrestler and very bad with his mic skills (if he has any). Wish Rodhes wins, since Bray is in Heaven.
Mamma Rhodes, look at your son
The fact that you can hear The Rock talking smack loud and clear 😂
Throw Out the Rock
I saw Ronnie 2k am pissed😐
After watching this, I am not the fan of rock anymore.
The Rocks new intro was awesome! All did great but I truly need to commend The Rock and Roman for how well they worked together. The Rock did great and Roman did also.   Thank you The Rock for making Wrestling great again!
I really used to watch this as a kid and thought it was real 😂
Who won the match
The Rock and nothing else
Rock will get Roman for that spear
Winnie Harlow in the front row ❤
I wanted the Hollywood heel rock intro so bad I’ve been waiting for it since he went heel for this and when his regular theme came on I was so disappointed then that song switch came and I literally got chills I replayed it like 10 times that mixed with the best was amazing
The final BOSS!!!!!!!!
Great ending, nothing special but rock finishers and Michael cole to close it out
Cody likes been given crowd if as he not married.. Other wise the time he wasted on listening to people could pay off.. Tell him we don't want to see him wasting time tommorrow
It was pretty obvious they was going to let the Rock and Roman win. I’m tired of the same people winning
That ducks
Am I watching TNA or wee
Man this crowd doesn't deserve this match, they're dead!
Of course the rock won seems like roman reigns is never gonna lose
Boring
6:55 SPEAR! 7:15 Pedigrees 8:15 Cody Bottom Lol 8:21 Spear through the barricade
The match itself was great. The outcome was disappointing.
I’m nanotubes here to watch a video game of oveeaged men grabbing each other
Triple H really hate Cody.
Yes was the rock
Rock and Cody have come a long way from the in-ring segment they did with Damien Sandow in 2013.
The Rock's actual wrestling is on point for real.
The rocks reaction
🎉🎉🎉 Roman and rock wins🎉🎉🎉
It was night one and people want 5his to te how it ended 😂😂.  Tonight's the night you 🤡's 😂😂😂
Mama rhodes look at your son look at your son 😂
Yep Cody is screwed tonight
Say what you say about The Great One but you cannot deny his love for entertaining the millions☝🏽 RESPECT💯🫡
ROMAREY EL MEJOR LUCHADOR
Shit...I hate Rock after that and his Poppy. More then ever.
The Rock is wearing bell bottoms and a fan made belt he made for himself? Really? Lame.
The rock is unbeatable , love u rock❤❤
worst spectators in wrestlemania history
Eeeeh
rhodes almost won that too
the final boss elbow, the rock up and reigns on her knees lol
Nonsense
The start was really slow, but dam, they delivered after that start Big Time.
For show is good
8:54😂😂😂 fake why go to the rock anyone watch wwe kids😂😂😂
The fact everyone booing Cody and Seth when then cheered before wrestlemania what’s gunna happen tomorrow
Wtf😂
8:57  Rock:oh you shave your back...oh i like yo cut g!!😈 Cody:not agin!!😭 roman:thank god its not me😈
Seth reminds me of a dorkier chris Jericho
Compare the crowd to one on a random RAW during the Attitude Era, and you'll see whats wrong with wrestling these days.
Así cualquiera gana Román eres un fiasco.
Wow
i cant believe rock took that announce table bump
Los mejor de la wwe siempre van aser los samoanos Román Reigns y the Rock Cody y Rollins son va sura
The rock is abusing power
Worst wrestlemania match
Everyone in Philly was asleep. Horrible Wrestlemania crowd. They couldnt even get good chants going.
The rock is sick mehn for that "you are fired stunt"
7:19 ref face when he couldn’t get the three count 😂
That was so predictable I knew what was going to happen before it did… I guarantee tonight Cody is going to win and the Rock is going to turn on Roman to get his fans back and then go back to movies for a few months and make a special appearance back to normal… this is like a soap opera I can write for the WWE lol
Hi there what up ❤❤❤❤
7:55 leave like when you see 2chainz 😂😂
I guess Cody Rhodes won't be undisputed championship beat
Cody lover
“Feels like I’m back in the attitude era” is hecka funny
It was perfect perfect. I loved it.
❤
The Rock is going to get what is coming to him.Vince Mcmann should fired the Rock
The crowed sucked
This sh$ is getting old I Watched wrestling mania all the way up until this match because they cheater and I no respect for The Rock🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
The usual Victim at WWE PLEs is the Spanish Announce Table!
متوجه نمی‌شوم ؟؟ آیا مردم نمی‌دانند که همه اینها یک نمایش است و از قبل برندگان و بازندگان مشخص شده است 😂 لعنتی
Really  rock 😮
Wait guys the ref counted 3 before rock pulled him out 😂 meaning Cody and Seth won the match long ago
The rock only love to live off other people
Okay, WHO is the dude with the Green T-Shirt and beige hat tho?!? 😅😂 Dude is Always in the crowd &  in the same seat! 😂
There Burying cody Rodes and AEW is loving it. If He Dont Win Tonight And Win the Title Its Going To be Sad. Id like To see Them Save Brock lesnar For tonight And He Comes out Takes Out The Bloodline. Thats The Good Storyline In Philly
Not that I’m mad at the main event for night two, but what happened to the women’s main event that they worked so hard for?
Were they outside in that Philadelphia cold air? No wonder the crowd was less energetic.  Freezing their balls off out their.
Where was Seth what did he even do😢😢😢😢😢
Rock bottom was terrible the rock is out of wrestling shape
Lmao.. can't believe ppl still pay and watch this. I'm here for the drama😂
ww
As awesome as it is to see a legend back in the ring, it is my opinion that the whole Final Boss thing, is such a dorky move 😂😂
F
Where are all those hyper jabbed roid wrestlers gone?! Everyone Looks Like skinny dudes man... 😂😂😂
The rock the goat 🐐
Beware of Trollls
The Rock the superb and wonderful
underwhelming
La Roca Y Roman Valen Arta No Saben Luchar Legalmente Son Unos Puercos  El Campeonato Era Para Cody Legalmente
La Roca Y Roman Valen Arta No Saben Luchar Legalmente Son Unos Puercos  El Campeonato Era Para Cody Legalmente
If Cody wins tonight z i bet that MITB briefcase is getting cashed in tonight.
Man Philadelphia is TRASHHHHHHH!!!! Get that city outttta here
Cody Rhodes is competing in Bloodline Rules tonight. 🙁
I was waiting for Ultimate Warrior to come in for the rescue…
Ese inútil no puede ganar d forma limpia?
Let me guess, the Rock will turn or accidentally make Cody Rhodes win?
7:05 the announcer yelling "HE DIDN'T MEAN TO" like they were little kids and Rock's mom just walked in the room absolutely killed me
stone cold and John Cena are coming boys
Literally bloodline can't handle  the American nightmare Cody Rhodes hahahah such ashamed for the rock and of course same old rock from then to now hahahaha
Damn I felt that belt slap
All of codys fan boys sad
The crowd wasn’t that bad like y’all think!
The rocks flexibility! lol 7:14
Why even have Roman reigns do matches anymore just have him walk around with the belt and never fight again the writers always write in for him to cheat and win kind of getting old and boring honestly. While I know these are all scripts matches we don't even get a surprise for two plus years with Roman. All the other matches were great but we mite as well fast forward to his matches it is always him winning. Boo wwe writers you people suck at writing especially with the talent that is in the wwe now.
Cody becoming the champion will die down within 3 months man. Hulk hogans record needs to go the same way they ended undertakers. I can’t lie WWE need a new legend in our era and that’s Roman Reigns.
This match took 30 minutes to get good smh
the most electrifying moment in the history of sports entertainment
Seein rock show Cody’s mom he’s really got him in his hands notice how he protects his head with his hand when he softly lays him on the table….could literally end his career or life by inches if he got his neck or head wrong….this is the stuff I look for yrs watchin
Anything to ruin codys historic run for nonsense. Wreslting is garabge
Roman is a spittin image of sika and opa in the ring
Is it me or was the crowd not as involved with Seth's theme song/chants in this match?  Or at all? Less reactions from front row than I've ever seen.
When yer the boss you can make yer own belt…💪🏻
romans hair ....
Heaven will soon mock Roman for these bet soon because it collect it with cheat 💔 once again to hell with u the rock ❤️☝🏿
4:30 5:10 6:10 7:36 lmao The Rock funny asf 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
I couldnt understand why the ref was blatantly favoring the bloodline it kinda fked the storyline  a little bit for the match.
I no the story line The rock will betray roman because of the spear and Cody will win ik it from the start I even knew they would win night one
This fake asf but still fire 🔥
The Match was better than i thought it would be!
The way Roman gave the rock spear was so cool and funny, if u look at Roman's face. 😂
Turning Cody towards the right camera angle before the rock bottom showed great presence of mind
Its so unfair.
Lol the rock looks like he's wearing diapers
Wrestlemania shoulda be in warm weather cities now that they hold them outdoors.
Why that title look better then the actual titles 😂
WWE IS DYING
Im not used to advertising on the apron of the ring and on the mat I think Vince was right about not allowing it , it didn’t feel like wwe it felt like njpw
Bro, the ref be like😂😂😂
Rock’s entrance was almost half of the video 😂😂😂😂
I am so disgusted with wrestling. They are making a big mess. It seems like they keep digging the whole deeper
That wasn't the People's Elbow. That was the new and improved, Bloodline Elbow.
So no one is going to talk about how the rock  just casually is having his initiation ritual with the thunder representing Lucifer  . 😅
So no one is going to talk about how the rock  just casually is having his initiation ritual with the thunder representing Lucifer  . 😅
This match was sooo good
Greatest tag match of all time! All four guys put on a slobberknocker
Triple H, we are with you forever and ever
Horrible. The fact they let the Rock win is an absolute joke.
I think the fact that Rock hasn’t wrestled in so long actually helped him stay in perfect condition considering his age.
Phenomenal match
Dayal Republic WrestleMania 40 Honestly sleepy 👎💩
Cody Rhodes should of won that man
The Republic is a spender, frankly. There are pictures of wrestlers and other action pictures like this 👎 This is what made you think you liked this character, but you did not like this character. This was a great success.
Es imposible sobre el desgraciado de the rock y se cree el jefe final
Esa es mala
Thank you Vince Mcmahon!! Happy wrestlemania to it's creator!!
Every time Rock saids "mama Rhodes" i burst out laughing
You're becoming someone else with a bald had😂
Wow congratulations 🎊 👏 😊
Rock wyg do you have a bald had 😂😅
Being outdoors and cold really hurt the crowds energy.  I went to Wrestlmania in Seattle that was partially covered and we were lucky on the weather but I was always wondering what they were thinking doing the biggest show in April in the NW outdoors
It's just not the same
Cody is the king
The Rock needs to leave WWE. This has been unbearable to watch
I love the final boss
Did Philly know there was a show on? That's why Pittsburgh is so much better. Take note WWE for next time haha
Wtf man its the Rock at Mania! Must be crowd full of casual fans
Boooooooooring! Felt like a normal ppv match not a WM main event
That title looks amazing especially with the Final Boss carrying it
Bro literlly said mama rhodes
Happy to see the rock win👍🎊🔥🎉👏
Results exactly what everyone predicted like always wwe wack these days
This event sucked😂
Pretty boring match was exactly how I saw it going so the Cody vs Roman match on Sunday is going to be more Roman with the belt so I'm out. But thanks for giving Sami the intercontinental belt.
That final rock bottom sounded critical
I’m gonna need the Wrestlemania Sunday crowd to be a lot louder and crazier than the Saturday crowd was. Sounded like they were asleep the whole show
Of course Roman and Rock win of course!  If Cody doesn't win next night then I'm quitting WWE  Well.. I say that but let's face it I will probably watch it again a few years later or heck maybe even a month later  Besides we all say we'll stop watching WWE but then we go back to it a few months or years later
What a Joke. WWE is done
Why is Priest so dumb
I hope to god Rock is gonna have 2 or 3 matches left
The Rock sold that spear like it really cut him in half 😂😂😂. He’s the 🐐 at selling finishers
Febreeze!!!!
😂😂😂
Momma Rhodes looks at your son 😂
where is roline?
The Rock is back
TOP 🔥 Match
After being speared by Roman Rock gave that look when your mother or father spank you. You make that crying look without make a sound lol
That was a crazy match. I wonder if Dwayne's abs still hurt.😮
I haven’t felt this vibe of wrestling since 2010 cause I felt wrestling started becoming average from there but since the bloodline script I have been hooked this is so goooooooodddd
The rock looks better than he ever did he needs to stick around this time and challenge Cody Rhodes for the world title if he beats Roman at night 2
The best it's been I years stop watching a long time ago but lately it's been just like the 2000 attitude era
Wrestlemania in London wouldve hit different
What was the stipulation of the match ??
Roman y la rock no ganan si no usan los cinturones era una lucha normal  no donde se valia de todo cody y sheth son completos y han demostrado porq estan hay
yo main event on yt they really upgrading they service W
So who bets Cody wins tonight even tho it’s bloodline rules I get a feeling the wwe wants us to think Cody is screwed then he pulls out the win anyways
Min 10 27 me cague de la risa con la celebración del fan en la cara de la mamá de cody épico
It wasnt that the crowd was mid...they were into all the matches...they are in an open air arena so a lot of the sound imisnt isolated enough to really hear the excitement. Think about it like a football...u rarely hear the crowd when u watch football on tv
So the first time the rock put the 1 up without his thumb is right after he slides his fingers across his throat? Coincidence or was that a hint to roman?
The Greatest Fight in History
Rock looks like a big crying baby that fell down and hit his elbow or something when Roman spears him 😂😂😂😂😂
8:55 the final boss slap!! 😂
Damn taking that Rock Bottom thru the table at his age...man he loves this business
stupied match ever
I swear, almost all clips I see these days of wwe....the crowd is just, dead. Almost like they are paying people to fill up these seats. Just weird & completely different from how it was 20+ years ago.
The rocks ego is so big that he had to get the pin and with "the people's elbow"? Did the fans deserve more? Idk
You have to be mentaly disable to pay a ticket and watch this
Man this crowd sucked
Pure garbage
Comedy....
Wwe sad now a days
wow they actually showed us the result
The advertising is so off putting lol
Codys body doesnt match his face.  Hes such a twig. And youre telling me hes going for the title? Lol wrestling these days.
Cody and seith❤❤❤❤
So that means Cody Rhodes is going to win tomorrow watch you’ll see I’ve watched enough wrestling to know
Mama Rhodes, you look at your son.
How boring will night after Wrestlemania Raw be then lol
WWE where the best walk to the ring for nearly a half of a 10 minutes highlights video
I had a feeling that the rock and roman was going to win
Code road is no bady
والله مباراه قوييييييه 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🔥
For every like on this comment, I will do 1 pushup
Cody Rhodes Wooooooooh
7:00 new meme
This match to me was quite boring. Just punches and kicks most of the time. Almost no suplexes or throwing moves.. very disappointed to say the least.   Wrestling will NEVER be what it used to be, in my opinion.
Very strong stardust
Rock looking like he passed a kidney stone with that spear really was hilarious.
Wait they won?
Why dark the top of the arena??? This isn't a AEW show is it???
That Chick Ring Announcer Is Trash.
They skipped every entrance but Rock lol
“Cover… by the Rock… Cody… is… screwed…” Amazing call as per usual
The rock is the biggest cry baby in history change his name to crybaby wennie boii rock
🤧🤧🤧😤😤😤🤬🤬🤬😭😭😭😒😒😒👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
The rock should be a 99 overall
That’s a f’ing superstar not this central casting wwe stars
That spear just set up the rocks turn at Sunday nights match.
Cody Rhodes winning the title confirmed ✅
The Rocks belt is Tuff 😤😤😤
Who agrees the rock entry is fire.🔥
Rock still takes the Spear like he's been stabbed by an actual spear, and I love it.
The deadest crowd in wrestlemania history?
8:38 the most realistic punch ever
Not watched WWE in years but this riverly looks great been watching there highlights and segments on youtube
Thank god. I'm tired of cody
Good on WWE for uploading and saving a lot of copyright hassle😂
there was some very good action in this match, but the outcome was very predictable and so was many outcomes in night 1
☝️👑🙏
8:17 everyone was talking about how selfish the rock is, and this man put Cody over by letting him use his own finisher. Mad respect.
It's kind of sad to me that no one had come close to the rock and stone cold Era! That's why they still need the 50 year Olds to come back and show them what's up
تمثيل زي الزفت
Final boss rock huh? I can dig it
Did anyone else find Pat McAfee's commentary specifically in this match to be unbearably awful?
Just as cm punk predicted, Cody losing
So many finishers not being finishers anymore.
This is real wrestling 😂😂😂😂😂😄😄😄😄😂😂😂😂
KevonStage brought me here
I just hope the Cody vs Roman match isn’t a letdown after this match. I was thoroughly entertained
Today someone from the attitude era show in up
Crowd seems relatively quiet. Wrestling seems like a shadow of its former self.
Who is that woman with the black guy???
This is my first time watching wrestlemania since wrestlemania 29 when I was 12 years old! Wrestlings so awesome rn!!!
This Era of wrestling really sucks! The Rock should’ve stayed retired
All the officials are fake they are on romans side why would Rock pull the official when he was counting
What $not doing in the front row? 😭
This is the biggest piece of BS I’ve ever seen of fighting
Hope they never do it in Philly again the CRowd was TRASH
What a fun! 😂
Can they fire that ring announcer bro so dam annoying sounding
who is the tribal chief, rock or roman??
Great match but the end was hokey. Cody literally lay for over 30 seconds and the receive an elbow drop and gets pinned from it?
This is a Joke compared to the attitude era 😂😂😂😂
Rocky turned up tonight! Performance of the night. Dudes 52 soon and he hasn’t lost it. You can tell how much it means to him, to be in such good condition
Omg what a match to end off night 1 of WrestleMania XL really had hoped cody and seth would win poor Cody and seth 😭😢😳😩 the rock and Roman cheated.
Wildest prediction I have is mjf shows up and costs Cody the victory
La entrada de la roca fue la mejor que e visto ❤
Finish The Story.
So my prediction for main event is now that it's bloodline rules for the final fight Roman reigns is going to have the rock and the usual members of the bloodline family support him but Cody roads is going to get help from new intercontinental champ Sammy Zain as well as USO brother that won the other night and the guy who helped motivate Sammy and Cody will win but then there will be a heel turn by Sammy Zains training partner remember Sammy owes him a favour
Awful crowd
So boring Match
The worst wrestlenmany I've ever seen, I didn't like that Cody the Rock and the Trival Chief lost, they didn't deserve to win triple h, it's a mistake.
Cody about to become a jobber again
Boring 😴 like always
Stone cold is comming I hear the glass shattering
How much of a self centered narcissist must you be to call yourself "the final boss!" Wrestling today is nothing but a joke 🤣
Rock to dethrone Roman Reigns to be the new champion
Red white n blue went underground on that one !🌞
So title match will be Cody and Rollins vs rock, solo, roman and jimmy?
CM punk will pull something tomorrow I can feel it
The rock acting like bowser 😂😂😂😂 and Cody like Mario 😂
this is pathetic, u guys never seen ufc? 👀
"Look at your Son" lol the Rocks showing off but this is a Good Match up
4mins out of 10mins just on the Rock’s Ringwalk 😂😂
Underrated line:  "Cover by The Rock... Cody is screwed."
Great match
👎👎👎👎👎👎
The main event felt so slow that I fell asleep. Not a good main event for night 1.
It was unfair that Cody lost the match
I’m glad that Seth didn’t betray Cody :)
Bruh I missed the wrestlemania 😂
If you support the nazi wwe you might as well support p.diddy and epstein. How's all the rapists doing in this company.
the rock and roman only won cuz they’re cheaters lmao
8:56 when your son been disrespecting his mama for long enough 😭 WUCHAA
The Rock In His Wrestling Gear In The Really Loud House Era
😢🎉🎉😢😢😢😢
😢🎉🎉😢😢😢😢
😢🎉🎉😢😢😢😢
Roman you coward. 😂 Can never fight fair. 👎🏽
Rock entrance was electricfying
That crowd was cold af last night
Now i wanna play tekken & street fighter randomly.😂😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Instant Classic
Disgusting match.. but epic
bruh we finally got a good sell from a spear, how many years has it been? LOL
Rock showing up in the flames made me thing Rock was turning into Gangrel.
Rock bringing back The Corporate Elbow
Atleast cody and seth completed 99% of the game....see what i did there 😊
The rock é muito foda...
Of course Philadelphia crowd sucked. That city is such a dump.
The crowd actually booed Cody when he didn’t let rock pull off the people’s elbow the first time.
Grandpa rock still strong
I haven’t watched wrestling since 2006 and I am BACK!!!
At this point the final boss should actually be a rare unlock in the game.
What belt is the rock holding
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THE ROCK AND ROMAN SUCKS BOOOOOOO!!!
What a match!!
The rock Is such a baby😂
Show on weekend and people still tired? Mid af crowd
La roka no debería pelear mas por culpa de el no veo mas raw
As somebody who has authority to say this: this is one of the best main events I've seen.  Check the wording.
IF YOU SMELLLLLLLLL, WHUT CODY RHODES IS COOKING..? ☝️🤔
That crowd was trash last night t
Esto es una nueva era
Crazy how people are worried about the crowd versus the actual wrestlers. I didn't know the crowd mattered! I remember when covid hit and there was no crowd!!! 😂
F**k this match, Cody is just disappointment, Seth really tried for Cody but Cody screwed up, there is no assurance that Cody Rhode is gonna win the undisputed championship match which bloodline rules is involved.......... No way Cody😢😢😢
The Final Boss!!!!!!!!
Seth Rollins doesn't belong in that ring unless he is doing the job.
WTF black Adam 😂
The batle better soprimise
Oh My godness
pls dont let cody win man not yet bloodline story too good rn
👆👆👆
The way roman spears the rock and the rocks face says it all lol 😂😂😂😂
Seth look like a idiot  😂😂😂
This is all fake and acting for marketing only 😅😅
8:57 rock legit hitting the ropes with that belt
That was Known
I think the rock is going to betray roman on Sunday and codi gets the championship
NAZ REID.
Let’s all give a standing ovation for that barricade for always taking a spear during a no rules match. Lol
Philly is a trash crowd. Don’t host WM there ever again. The crowd killed it. Audio is added in. It was not this loud live.
I like Seth
How in the heck did The Rock hold a straight face during the match with that goofball wannabe Macho Man impersonator outside the ring??? 😂😂😂😂
Rollins was the biggest bro during this match. Homie was Cody’s guardian Angel. They better not have him turn on Cody for some stupid callback to the SHIELD betrayal. That’s been outplayed to hell.
😮😮😮😮😮
Best fight 2024🔥🔥👆👆👆👆👆
Match went for so long, we finally got to see Roman's hair when it's dry.  Also hilarious just how juiced the Rock is, doesn't even have the flexibility in his arms to be properly pedigreed like Roman does.
NIGHT 2 ACTIVATE FINAL BOSS VIRUS  GLASS BREAKS
Seth Rollins tries too hard to
That was wack
So two nights of ECW I like it 😂😂😂
Boring
Great fixed match! 😂
Who won ?
I knew Cody would lose... But that Roman's spear to Rock... Was worth it all... That was my pop of the night... 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Cody rhodes is just sloppy. He did the pedigree wrong. He is not that good of a wrestler to take finishers like that and be expected to count out. Cody moves around like that femal wrestler that does that backwords worm. LOL. considering shes new from nxt
I thought it was a tik tok belt or something the rock had at entrance
The Rock being speared might play into tonight.  Maybe the Rock is the Head of the Table and will make it known to Roman by allowing Cody to win.
reminds me when goldberg hit the rock with his spear in 2003 backlash  and he was in serious pain and now again he felt it from his family member lmao.  This is gold.
🥵
Bra it was already 3 😳😂😂😂💯
Ain't gonna lie, The Rock is in excellent shape especially at his age. I'm motivated to be healthy like that when I'm in my 50s🔥🔥🔥💪🏼🏋🏽‍♂️
This is good means Cody will win title
Rock’s face after getting speared was priceless! 🤣🤣🤣
They should announce The Rock as the people’s champion
The Rock coming out wit his own belt is crazy 😳🔥🔥🔥 bra we really just seen the Rock at WrestleMania in 2024 this is crazy he hasnt lost a step either 🔥🔥🔥🔥 my favorite wrestler always was
This is HAMO💪
the rock's facial expression at 6:59
Tonight's the night
الباصي باصي ولي يغلط معا كودي رودز يتباصي
Hi
ميو
Hey no, this is real robbery...How can the rock pull off the referee as Cody had Roman on the ground and about to be 1.2 and about to count 3.
Worst entrance ever
This reminds me of donkey kong 64 when King K Rool cheats during the last fight 😂😂😂
Stop using stadiums and go back to arenas like MSG.
Match was an A++++
Yeah Philly we here
This is sick I'm starting to hate the rock!
I'm so glad they showed this incredibly mediocre 4 minute entrance in an 11 minute highlights clip.
The golden bull with Satanic rock in it.
Rock is to swole! Cody wasn't even trying to connect his hands on the pedigree.
Cody could never 😂😂
Debate of WrestleMania: Is that blue thing Seth was wearing a hat or not
👍😁👍
One of the worst crowds of all time. Had my doubts about Philly
The Rock still got it💯
I was actually rooting for Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins, the underdogs. The Rock and Roman Reigns are now the heels.
To all the Cody crybabies, The Final Boss warned you.
If i was there id be cheering every second
Knew Seth was a clown
Nakaka badtrip naman tong match nato .pisteng the rock Yan ..literal sa daya .bwiset .!!! Akala ko nMan Kay seth at Cody ang victory
Haven't watched WWE in years. The Rock is kinda slow...Still, good match though.
Prediction for WM40: Cody wins title and loses it to Priest
Look at the rock's face when he took that spear 😂😂😂😂 hilarious
I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT THE BLOODLINE WAS GOING TO LOSE 😱(7:15)
Was this a no DQ match?
Crowd were like NPCs  , worst Wrestlemania crowd in years .
If Roman retains I will never watch WWE again. Took long enough.
This match was paced a bit too slow to favor the Rock and to hide his ring rust.
After being away from the WWE scene since the Ruthless Aggression Era, this has been an amazing couple months of catching up. Rock is doing the best work of his career right now and still has it! Great matches last night, the whole crowd deserves to be thrown away though!
I don’t watch wrestling anymore and I don’t know how many more of these performances we’re gonna get from him but it always great to see the Rock back in the ring! My wrestling 🐐💯🤨
Rock coming back 10 years later just to take a belt that ain’t even his and has no reason to lmao
The Rock can barely move in the ring. Go away bruh
Damn the rock didn’t even break a sweat during this match. He definitely proved he still belongs in the ring, it was impressive.   Oh and his entrance was like the dopest thing ever 🤘🤘😎
7:00 the rock face😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Roman ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Cody Rhodes will tonight to start off the New Era😂😂
The wrestlemania should have been in Brooklyn
Hope Sunday night, Cody has backup coming. Hope Cody's friends and brother arrive in Philly to aid Cody in the Bloodline Rules Match. Hope Kenny Omega, Dustin Rhodes or MJF arrives and makes a Impact on night two
I hate The Rock so so much 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡☠️☠️☠️☠️
Cody Rhodes won! They just took it from him!
So Cody "completes his story" on sunday.   No way the WWE lets their ferret lose twice .
Rock said he would come back and wrestle if only he wins the match.
best match I've seen in a while ..if only Roman and Kode's matches could bring 1/10 of the energy The Rock brings we would all be happy we need to see Rock vs Stone Cold and the roof would come off the house
Wrestlemania did their job, crowd didn’t at all
The intros took too freaking long and the match was so boring at the beginning.
I'm no professional, but honestly, night 2 will go one of two ways. Either it will be the greatest triumph in history, with Cody Rhodes conquering Roman and overcoming Bloodline Rules to finish the story, or it will make this whole "finishing the story" business feel more like a cash cow than anything else, being milked until Wrestlemania 56 before it actually, y'know, finishes.  Point being, it's tomorrow, or never.
The Rock needs to retire with dignity your era has passed long time ago.
Are they makeing Roman like an undertaker streak with the belt or what and i dont want to see this next year eaither tow years in a row was enough for Cody vs Roman lol
Extreem cheating by the Rock.
The crowd was off last night!   I guess most of them didn’t sleep well. 🤣☹️
Man! Ive got a feeling that the rock's gonna leave again after this WM he's just giving us a night to remember.
I have a feeling Roman will pay for that spear
We need Brock Lesnar back.. the real tag team match Cody,Brock Lesnar Vs Roman & Rock🍺🍺🍺🍺
Cody pedigree was horrible.
this sucked
looks like total garbage  cant wait till the Rock leaves  hes ruined the bloodline story
The problem was with the lighting.They had too many bright lights around the ring, you can barely see the crowd hyping up. Shine some light on the people for god's sake!
Have they performed in weather like this before?
what a show!!!!!
These guys are a disgrace to the profession. Nobody sacrificed their body like Mick Foley and Shawn Michaels.
Lets go Donald Trump .
💯🔥💯🔥💯best²
I live in the UK so i had to be up at 1AM to watch this and it was worth it. Same with Wrestlemania 37. 8/10 show and a stacked card. Night 2 will make it 10/10. I'm glad Sami got his moment and won the IC Title like it's 2016 again. And i got goosebumps seeing Sami and Kevin reunite. And "if you count you're fired" is top tier heel Rock. It seemed ok after the Spear to Rock but ik Triple H planned that spot to set up Rock and Roman at Wrestlemania 41.
What a farce in the beginning it was just between Cody and Roman there rivalry then the bosses put the Rock into the mix and from that moment on it was all about the rock. Roman might as well been written out of the storyline because Rock made it all about him, all that run up that Roman did and the Rock gets all the glory in the end. SMH
The additdue era! ❤❤❤❤
What on Earth was that!?
👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
The Rock coming back to wrestling has got to be the most awesome thing to happen in 2024 😂😂
Best match ever
Great show, trash crowd!
We want Cody
"Roman has defeated many opponents with the guillotine"  Roman hasn't defeated many opponents period let alone clean let alone with a single move.
Bro the crowd was quiet as hell and I’m from PA near Philly (come on Philly you can do better than that!)
The rock is still hilrious even when he is serious😂
Okay, The Rock does not deserve to have an entrance as long as the undertaker.
Crossroads is the dumbest finisher ever lol.
THE WORST CROWD EVER IN PHILADELPHIA. All the entrance  this is the worst crowd ever in a WrestleMania 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
What belt is The Rock having?
We want to see the rock and Roman reigns in a one on one match cause this match now with cody is a setup
Rock should be fired not wasted time on this bs any more
6:15 hopefully no kids try to replicate whatever the hell rock and Roman are doing to Cody here 😂
Anybody else thought The Rock entering with that belt completely ruined the aura? I get the sentimental value behind it, but it's completely irrelevant to the story that is being told. We already have two title holders in the main event picture, adding a third belt just felt out of place.
Rock definitely cheated
The sad part is cody won't finish he's story and it is really getting boring with roman as champion its need a change but you know cody is going to get screwed again like it as been for the last few years, come on wwe change it now
That’s crazy. Wwe really sold out to the prime scam. Money is that important even after you’ve made billions huh
Who won this match
The rocks entrance is so cool
👏👏👏👍
That's OK. Just gonna make it more satisfying win Cody beats Roman.
This crowd was electric ❤
God
Pobre cody
The Rock looks like a real computer game character.
The amount of ads not even just the video but in the stadium and now in the ring is crazy 😭 very money hungry
Why would they ruin the match with a great buildup like that. I'm disappointed
Good God.🥹🙏🏾
Rocks arms are so big Cody could barley hook him for the pedigree. They all performed greatly
I had to go to the store at the beginning of this match, i get back and they're still doing entrances. I had a good laugh lol
Lillian garcia is missed
Codi hoy no pierde ya eso está listo el nuevo campeón ba aser Codi
Predictable... There was no way they wouldn't have Bloodline Rules on Night 2 ❤❤❤
Everyone talking about the crowd being dead what about that big green LED MAKING THE CROWD LOOK SO SMALL? Like you can barely see the front row
8:13 Cody telling The Rock basically to jump for the Rock Bottom.
Rock's selling is next level. I remember when CM Punk kicked the Rock with a simple kick; the Rock looked like a fish gasping for air. With this spear, it seemed to hurt his internal organs badly rather than just laying down flat after taking it.
Fake sports 😊
April 6 1997 1-6 Milan 🔴⚫️ Juventus ⚪️⚫️
The macho man being in the crowd did it for me
Tonight,i hope WWE brings back The "Broken Dreams" Theme 😢
The Rock = the goat😎
Who’s the guy next to Cody Rhodes’ mom
Lazy part timers have hijacked WWE
Hope the Roman fans have their excuses ready for tonight
Rock turned back time. He looks like he’s 30. The guy looks physically better than Cody, Roman, and Seth.
The match was so slow and boring. They really could have done it better.
Terrible waste of time with the most obvious writing ever
Lets gooooooo 🔥 🔥 🔥
I hate wwe😂😅😊
Rock finally used that belt 💯
Porquería de resultado 😢
When Cody Did the Cross Rhodes to Roman he busted it Roman Reigns's nose 👃
Seeing the rock use the belt on Cody makes me laugh. 😂
Hollywood Rock is back!  Tonight Rock teams up with Roman against crybaby Cody.  All those crybaby Cody fans will feel the sting of losing again.
What a match this was it’s been prob over 12 years since they had me like this thank you triple h
what the hell rock ... cody @ seth freaking rollins my idol for now❤❤❤
when rock  reached in for a tag had me dead lol
Cody Will Win on Nite 2"              The ( TITLE ) is His"  For Sure After Losing Nite 1",                        REVENGE is The Sweetest Joy Next to Getting  _____ !!! A Famous Poet Once Said  ( 2-Pac )
The rock always wins! Hell yeah
They definetly piped down the crowd because in person it was crazy
Rocky is really old.😂😂😂 And These 3 stooges really protecting rocky in all the stunt and moves.
Imagine dustin or kenny appears tommorow
To much cheating and power tripping I wasn't interested in this match
one of the best put together matches i’ve ever seen 🔥
Roman has been selling out WrestleMania's Since He Became Champion. Rock is riding his coat tails and I don't see Cody Rhoades taking the title on Day 2.
Dude, in 2024, everyone has a negative opinion about EVERYTHING anymore. This match was AWESOME! Y'all have just fried your dopamine receptors with tiktok or something. The WWE is changing & for the better
I 2:59
One of the best spears ever ! Rock selling face was hilarious
This was an amazing performance… good match
Odds stacked against Cody, all nicely setup for Codys comeback and winning the title Night 2
Match was amazing crowd was just into it
The entrances of the rock and Roman reigns both had a black Adam tone! The black Adam’s 😂   Just imagine Jason momoa joining the rock and Reigns
There is No story now😂😂😂😂
All those ads around the ring ruined the experience. Wth wwe?
WOW. THAT WAS HORRIBLE.
WOW. THAT WAS HORRIBLE.
You suck roman
What belt does the rock have ??
I watched it live.  The crowd sounded great. I think it's just outdoor venues don't echo as much
It's all I wanted to hear. Hollywood Rock music, this is my fav of all time
The rock es el maestro de las trampas.
It's not good ..why win Rock and Roman why why?....😢😢😢
RIP , we had a good run but now it’s all 💩, the crowd , the fight all that left is 7 minutes entrance…
Cody should have won
Cody Rhodes needs Brock lesner to help him finish his story. The rock is a joke
Congrats on 100 mil 😊
Philly crowd sucks.. I hope they seeing them selves right now.. hope tomorrow will be diff.
Jajajaj the final boss los humillo
La mejor lucha que he visto sin lugar a dudas 🔥
O God why?  I really wanted Cody to win. Cody can beat Roman flat if not for bloodline interference 😢😢
If Cody wins title we riot
The crowd looks dead man
This is the 15th consecutive year That Wrestlemania is using White Ring Ropes (any anybody cares)
روك يجعل مصارعه لها تشويق لها قيمة و طز  في اليهوديين كودي و سيث
The rock went back to heel mode for a min lol
There is no longer a debate on who the biggest wrestling superstar is anymore. The rock came back and made wrestling cool again
Acknowledge me🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Where did The Rock win that ROCK BELT from?
I knew it! 😂😂😂😂
The mass majority of us recognize that Cody Rhodes is going to win. As predictable as an ending to Power Rangers. Not cool. Shame on the WWE for being so predictable and allowing all of us to know that Roman Reigns is going to lose his title.. I pray I'm wrong and somehow we get an incredible Roman Reigns retaining of the belt.
DQ ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION TOTAL BS
Kapan om dedy corbuzier masuk wwe 😅?
3:44 old rock struggling to climb up on the rope 😂😂
The Rock got speared so hard he turned into Batista
NEVER go back to Philly WWE unless it’s for a house show or sum. Crowd was WACK
Philly sucks.
Was the budget spent on Rock and Rheas entrance? I was expecting super cool entrances at Wrestlemania
Loved the Rock's entrance and the attire. I just wish he came out last as he is the final boss after all.
Damn that belt whip echoed thru the stadium lol 🤣
The Rock’s entrance was awesome
What belt was the rock holding
Boring Samoan cheater anjing
For thinking Seth would betray Cody tonight, he sure saved him a bunch tonight! Love them working together
Aew the best... WWE show right now only family show😂😂
philly is awful
Great match to watch 🖥️ Congrats to Winners Epic, awesome and interesant ending 🔥💎💯 Like who agree with me... 👏👏👏
omg what a great match I knew dawg that romain and the rock would win cuz they stand no chance against big dogs
I called it that cody and rollins would lose night one  and against all odds cody will win night 2
they did cody dirty. rocks story is weak now
The rock is so funny 😂
Cody is winning Sunday. There’s no doubt about it. He’s probably going to get help from others
Crowd licks
The Rocks face is the greatest screenshot for your next Meme!
I’m still mad about this outcome
It's too predictable, Cody Rhodes will win tonight
literally everyone in the from row is at every show it’s s ridiculous
This new WWE have been posting highlights for free, I like it
Is it just me or does the crowd seem dead asf 🤔
Wtf was Seth Rollins wearing 😬
Rock siter
Bruh why is Ronnie 2k there
That Philly crowd was so bad I’m now a cowboys fan 🤣🤣. Chicago would have rocked that cold stadium
Great to see rock use his old theme song.
Lol paid Hollywood actors lol.
Roak Roman falto
Hey you, wwe you really need to work on the theme songs…
The match was so good even to watch from phone. Wtf people who are in that stadium was doing?
Ok that Rock entrance was lit, all pun intended
Rocks entrance was awesome
I think we must get someone like Donnie Yen to learn Roman and the Rock so manners
Rock going to turn on Roman night 2 and Cody will win
Damn got 4 ads watching this
I think we must get someone like Donnie Yen to learn Roman and the Rock so manners
The rock titulo de que?  Alguien me dices??
Free Palestine
boringggg. we need new champppppp
Im calling it now...rock helps cody win tomorrow and a new rivalry between him and the bloodline.
Crowd was worse than WM 36s crowd
You don’t finish your story when ya mess with the final Boss!
Lame
It was kinda meh. Finish coulda been something you see any Raw or Smackdown tbh. Hope they got something better up their sleeve for Sunday.
Roman looks sick! I'm worried about his health 😢
Pura verga ya codo lo a vencido por 2 ocasiones el árbitro es intocable
Bro the rock face after Roman hit that spear😂
Cody: I got another story idea Triple H: Write it.
Night 1 Rhea vs becky.  Fine 6 man tag team ladder match. Chaos entertaining though  Tag team dom dom and santos vs rey and andrade.  (Entertaining with cool moves and spots, got ruined by the ending a little)  Jey vs Jimmy (Not emotional enough and was more just spamming moves like superkicks)  Jade, bianca, naomi vs Damage ctrl (Pretty mid cool to see em in the same ring)  Gunther vs Sami (Very unrealistic no selling from Sami but it was still a good match for me prob ment more for the kids like with bryan in wm30. Also gunther can now go for the main belt and maybe chad gable turns on sami)  This tag team (battle of the titans great match easily motn but a little slow to start which makes sense)
I don't even watch the fights anymore, they always make the lineage win, it's boring knowing the same result
Cody had already won this match. But the Rock just cheated.
Roman Reigns the most arrogant idiot no respect for  people he must come to South Africa where he can get some warm klappe
That crowd was lame af
The funniest part was when after rock hit cody with the belt...u could hear a woman yell "Take that 💩"....i spit my water out 😂😂😂
5555
We got rock and roman haterZ in here well you know what too damn bad, they are going to win today LOL "Touch the hand"
I seriously thought the rock will turn on Roman
That spear to rock will come back to haunt him tonight
Man the rock should have threw his shoulder pad for the people's elbow! 😢
Im a Eagles fan but im sorry Philly WWE Universe was lame...😢 Dead
💪💪💪💪
Head of the table 💥💥💥💥☝️☝️☝️☝️
Cody rhodes and seth rollins is my hero
Pedigree is sync was fire
Love it I hope Roman Remains  Champion
Thats total BS match that a referee can be intimidated not to follow the rules.
Cody Rhodes❤❤❤❤Rollins❤❤❤❤
The rick and roman reins is a dirty game
The Rock isn't the greatest wrestler of all time and the way he is heading this ppv is why wrestling is dying no new stars get to shine
Cheter gang🖕🏻
I got something I'm working on called Terradon7 & Ring Zero. I write.
Roman's acting and The Rock's selling of that spear was top top notch
If ppl just put their phones down and enjoy the show , the pure excited would’ve been all around the building ‼️
Raman Reigns got that Randy Orton juice😭😭😭
The rock and roman reigns is idiot
Kick out..
Nobody's going to mention the rock looking like disco inferno 😂😂😂
👎🏻
The crowd was going crazy' from beginning to end. I was there live! Best main event to end Night 1 🔥
The crowd definitely was not alive for this, watched for first time since WM14… times are changed, definitely a different product from start to finish
Cody from owner  in  all elite wrestling to wwe goldust loser
The ref counted to three botched and no DQ after rock put his hands on the ref sorry but wrestling has no rules anymore
If you count i will fire you is outrageous 😂 rock in the block can’t wait to see the conclusion tomorrow.. great match damn sonn
Cody Rhodes lose 😢 not again 😭
Roman the bast...
Real tired of the bloodline, now they have the sellout rock
WHERE’S KEVIN HART 😂 I WANT HIM TO ROAST THE ROCK
WRESTLEMANIA 40 LETS FRICKIN GO
😛😛😛😛That stupid idiots Roman can not win alone, The super star Cody has been fighting alone with the all Roman friends and relatives
Cody lost again but bloodline still rules
Jesus Christ Is Coming Soon Repent & Draw Near To Him ✝️❤️🙏
I still think Cody has a chance the rock made him that much more determined to win
Movie
I’ve gotten 4 ads 4 mins in the video Jesus Christ
I want Stone Cold Steve Austin to help Cody Rhodes on Night 2
Watching this match unfold has got to be one of the greatest things this year
Correct me if I'm wrong but roman still hasn't beaten Seth by pinfall in a long time
The Rock and Roman Reigns 100% going to feud soon 😂💀
They need to stop the outdoor stadiums. Crowd was so hard to hear it’s all I could focus on. Allstate arena would have been shaking.
four of them is a masters of selling 🔥💯
Seth freakin Rollins and Cody Rhodes and the bloodline never ever disappoints 🔥💯
☝️🐯🐯🐯
Rock wasn’t even sweating that’s scary
I love all the Tom Grossi shots! I spy
That momma Rhodas line gets me😅😅😅😅😅
the matches were overall amazing but the crowd is so mid
Ainit rinda royzi ty destroi req peply
Honestly I was pissed that roman won but it was easily match of the night and for me so far. Match of the year as well. Also the rocks entrance is amazing.
Philly crowd is mid, should have gone to Florida
Cody just needs to keep getting that shoulder up at night 2 no matter what.
Cody has zero, and the Rock says zero  chance of recovering  from  the beat down from  the Final  Boss and the Tribal Chief!  Bloodline Rulz now?  Hel,l, it was Bloodline  Rulz last night, and it was two on two.  Imagine what it  will be  when  the Boodline has the  Carte  Blanche to do whatever they want.  Solo, Jimmy, Roman,  The Rock,  maybe  the Wise Man?   Especially when  the referee is threatened by The  Rock  with being fired.   Yes, Michael Cole.  Cody Rhodes  is screwed!,!!
Cody can beat Roman, but Cody didn’t beat The Final Boss “The Rock”
Priest is cashing in his mib contract today
Absolutely pathetic I knew who was going to win before I even watched the match
Usually noone moves after the stomp. Reigns hops back up after receiving one to receive a Cody cutter?. Yea
I screamed at my TV when the rock beat that boy Cody Rhodes mans gotta do what a mans gotta do 😂
The Main event was fun and the IC Championship match was good, and Woman's Championship match was good... that's it. Aside from R-Truth's fun shenanigans and that double spot from Champa and Gargano, the tag titles ladder match was lame af. The Usos should be reprimanded and pushed to the bottom of the roster for that pathetic showing. That match just plain Ole sucked. Already forgot about the Rey Andrade win. HOF show the night before doesn't get any more disingenuous and kayfabe than that. Heyman wasted a moment to become a real person for a second and thank everyone for recognizing his contributions to the business but the longer it went on the more you come to the sad hollow conclusion that just like Vince, there is no character. This isn't talented acting. Paul Heyman and Vince and their ilk are truly those people you see on TV. Evil fu@ks. If Heyman didn't get into the wrestling business he be eating someone's liver with Fava beans and a fresh chianti. The production has not changed. That digital hologram bs is sooooo stupid. Lightening and giant Roman Reigns' just looks bad. It's like someone on the production team just discovered new software and he or she just can't control themselves and put a filter on the tech. WWE praising HHH for a mediocre product after all the money they spend compared to all other promotions, is pathetic.  WWE has no guts and bolts. No heart. No soul. It's like decorating your christmas tree with sentimental ornaments and then covering the entire tree with silver and gold tinsel. Overkill.
I was hoping for cody rhodes to win I don't like the rock like I used to no more
Roman spears Rock 😮😮 best moment of the nite
This is a 5 Star Match bro, this one and Jimmy vs Jey was GREAT
Great event but worst crowd…… Horrendous Philly crowd… Glad The Rock won… cry Philly cry!!!!!!!
مسابقه های تکراری که میزارن این چه مسابقه اس اخه از اول معلوم بود می‌خواستید رومن برنده بشه😂😂
Rock stole the show!!! He hit um with the smolder at the end
Gd this crowd is dead
If Roman reigns retains it's gonna ruin this business.
Philly, has the worst fans ever. Bill Burr was 100% correct when he ripped into them 20 years ago.
It was mostly dead all night 😂, Iam sorry but they had one good match all night. The people there was asleep 😂.
Final Boss Title on the line at Summer Slam, Rock Vs Roman Reigns, Rock Bottom to Roman Reigns Tonight pay back for that spear, and Summer Slam biggest Party of the Summer Head of the table on the line, The Final Boss Title on the line, and bragging rights is on the line, can’t wait. The USOs are absolute stars and will make an impact as single competitors. Loving The Triple H era so far, loving the merger so far, loving the fact that wrestling is fun again.
Wow even tho the Rock took all his time. The rock and Roman Reigns still got the victory over Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins. Despite the fact the Roman Reigns speared the Rock.
The Rock🔥
It's sad because this is my first WrestleMania I didn't even order I figure I'll just watch it on YouTube I don't understand how people can get into this match without a storyline maybe it's just me I've been watching wrestling for the last 62 years I went to the first Russell mania I went to WrestleMania 3 WrestleMania 9 WrestleMania 12 and I'm having a hard time trying to figure this out I don't understand the rock I probably never will after 11 years of being out of wrestling he comes back without a storyline maybe the storyline's there I just missed it and I'm just having a hard time understanding it why was The Rock there why did he come back did he need his 15 minutes of fame or was it because he got booed during the Maui fires with him and Oprah trying to collect money when you have a billionaire and a millionaire begging for money That's what I see I'm just having a hard time understanding this
Roman will lose tomorrow
This match ended the way it did cuz rock betrays reigns Sunday night. I called it
Why does wrestlemamia look so bad?
The bloodline are the biggest cheats in the history on WWE
Cody betrayed me
8:09 2chains and Winne Harlow trying to help the rock is hilarious
Cant lie match was kinda corny
Cody was good before but now he sucks💔
The rocks face is definitely going to be a new GIF
If only HHH could wrestle…. HHH-Rock, you may be the final Boss, but I am the game!”
Lol rock carrying his toy belt along
F**k YouTube comercial breaks
Good to know that they needed to put Rock's entire 4 minute entrance in this 11 minute video.
sad that the WWE has to rely on a 51 year old man to get any ratings.
In this match It shows that Roman “The Bloodline” is definitely nothing without The Rock people cheer more for Rock not Roman and Rock pinned Cody not Roman
Will Hulk Hogan show up to help Cody at WM 40 tonight? I've heard rumors...
Lmao the friendly fire spear way to take a bump
😂😂😂😂😂ese lanza😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅
The Rock always has the best sells. His Final Boss persona is just IT, ELECTRIFYING!!
This match lived up to the hype.
I was at the 3 hour mark going "They couldn't POSSIBLY put on an hour long match" and then they did and it was GREAT!!!!
If Roman wins on night two against Cody the WWE fans will leave in droves. Everyone is sick of watching Roman win and creative need to start earning their pay.  Wwe need to boost their roster to give more variety for fans. They should aim to get Wardlow ,Hobbs ,Brian Cage and Keith Lee from AEW and really start a new era ,instead of rehashing the same old matches between too few wrestlers 😅 If they could entice Hangman over that would really create interest involving Punk. Roman winning is like a broken record that they cant seem to stop playing 😅
Night 2:  “Here is your winner, and the NEEEEWWW WWE UNDISPUTED UNIVERSAL CHAMPION, COOOODDDYYYY RHOOOOODDEEESSSS!!!”
Winners don't cheat
How can i see the full match?
Bro this crowd in this generation is trash. I was hyped from start to finish. But i am from the attitude era.
This was my fav match all my. 🐐 packed
😆 😂😂 "Cover by the rock....Cody is screwed!" Great line from Michael Cole.
All of this to set up Cody to win the title tomorrow night... only for Priest to cash in immediately after 😂😂😂
No doubt, no argument this was the best match of Roman Reigns’s career
I thought Rock looked great, hopefully he has a singles match in him down the line ⚡️
There is no way Cody doesn’t win the belt. Would be incredibly lame to do all this build up, have the same match 2 years in a row, just for the outcome to be the same. They’re setting up Roman to drop the belt to Cody
100% sure that Cody will finish the story with the help of jey & seth to beat Roman & the bloodline once & for all which will be even more satisfying than beating Roman with no bloodline around
Next Wrestlemania in PuertoRico! Real fans, and always electric and pumped from the beginning !
He teams with solo to help him like delete the scripts of Cody vs Roman
Is it sunday or zaterday
kinda genius idea in writing to have the rock drink random water and prime to spit on people at the same time helps his stamina and endurance for getting back in the feel if this was thought out super smart
I don't think I'm going to watch Roman and Cody for the belt. I watch wrestlemania last night and it was good but when Roman and rock won that was disappointing and the wwe already knows Roman's going to win again because he cheats. The Roman and Cody match I won't watch its a Bathroom break at that time. It's a waste of time to watch them when you already know who wins.
I hope Roman loses
We need stone cold next match ❤
☝️☝️☝️
6:49 the Rock acting like he got stabbed by Roman reigns 😂😂😂
It's bloodline rules now. Cody is screwed
one question for wwe why winning match with cheating no real WWE it's fake just entertainment as learn money for views no emotional attachment for viewers I am to much disappoint WWE !😢💔🇳🇵
The double count at 7:17 was very funny
It's the most pathetic performance I've ever seen from Roman Reigns
Lmfao the desperation of the wwe trying to put on a high quality match  AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW AEWAEWAEWAEW
If you count, you're @^&*$! fired! 🤣
Just look at mama Rhodes both of those Facials say it all wat a shame the Rock laying the smack down on Cody Rhodes he put the Finishing touches on a lifeless ball bag american nightmare Cody rhodes by setting him Up 4,his special move The people's elbow  1 2 3 later Bol
After all they went through cody lost to the rock falling on him. What a joke
Am tierd of this cousin cheating
Philly crowd r stupid way target cody and seth
So Cody will be champion 🏆 tonight....
Personally I think final boss would be triple H. Where is golddust when u need him.
Next time Wrestlmania either in Los Angeles, Vegas or Miami
This match wasn't fair at all
The crowd sucked balls
Roman Reigns can never win without the help of a goonie
LOVE THE ROCK and ROMAN REIGNS ❤💕❤💕❤❤💕❤💝⭐⭐🌟🌟🌟⭐🌈🌈🌈
The guy shouting next to Mama Rhodes got me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Idk about everyone else, but they drug out the beginning of the match so long that i walked out mid match and didnt even see the ending. They did 30 mins of nothing, too long... best part was when Rock told the ref, if he counted he would be fired. Gunther/Sami was best match, by far, and the shocker of the weekend.
That was a hellova match....  And, there is one thing for damn sure...    And that is that Cody Rhodes named the hell out of his finishing move.
Cody better win tonight
..now what? Is roman vs cody gonna be useless or smth?
Where’s 😢Rollins???
Final boss 💥👏 Tribal chief 💥👏
Is that me?
Cody and Seth won first The Rock was threatening the referee so the ref couldn’t do anything
This was a great match that I think went too long.  The confusing thing about this is, by focusing entirely on Cody and The Rock for weeks and calling The Rock 'The Final Boss', the WrestleMania they were building to was Cody taking the title from Roman in Saturday and facing The Final Boss on Sunday to really get him over as champ.  But that wasn't the WM they booked.  So as awesome as the story has been week to week, the  WM matches for the payoff isn't really what the story should have been building to.  It's why this match was good, and the fans were behind it, but not as rabid as they should have been.  Nobody wanted to see 'The Final Boss' in a tag match that involved Seth Rollins.  But they made up for it by putting on a really good show.  I would have cut it by 15 minutes though.  50 some odd minutes is a long time for a tag match.
DWAYNE HERE
I love how Roman plays his role so well that everyone believed this is his real character, and when you are so good and you act so well that everyone accepts this character as a real character, then you are very special and unique, and Roman  He is the person who has all these and made you believe him with his act
In 2024 wwe is using peoples elbow as a finisher in a wrestlemania main event. goes to show how dumbed down it is all becoming. I get that they need school boys to get their moms credit card and buy a netflix subscription, but having dumb moves and children scammers like logan paul in your product is just idiotic
Maybe John Cena will support Cody Rhodes against Roman Reigns on Sunday 7.4.2024. Written 15:00 CET
Wwe is boring too much
The crowd seemed mediocre due to trying to hold back cheering for the Final Boss.  This is match of the night and I pat myself on the back for calling it right days ago.  Now let the cry babies shut their trap tonight when Roman retains, cry babies will leave you high and dry and ruin your plans.  Cody cannot replicate what Daniel Bryan did, he is on a total different level.  Roman's fantastic journey continues and he will beat the Final Boss to add to his legendary run in WWE.  To add, Cody's loss will trigger him to turn on the cry baby fans and that will be something we would love to see unfold.
Menuda basura nos an vendido dos payasos y si no sabéis de quien hablo es de los primitos que hacen lo que quieren y triple HHH hay callado pensaba que hiba a ponerse en su sitio pero como siempre fuera este campeón que no lo es
Worst wrestlmania crowd ever!??
What a boring match
Hold up when the rock was finna rock bottom cody and the camera man showed the crowd was that two chains in the audience lol or is my eyes playing tricks on me
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2k should really consider releasing after the most recent wrestle manias
This was  such a great match! Especially  the Rock in his 50s lfg!!  What an entrance!!!
Tanta espera para esto
Imagine referie would not have slided all around cody to then get slipped out from.rock
Rock will turn on Roman. Cody will win Championship.
Cody need brock stone cold jey uso...man Bloodline there frontline the whole match its bout to be a lil royal rumble inside and outside the rings
Count 1,2,3 aaaaaaand Cody Rhodes just got buried again.
Never go back to philly
The Rock is 51....that is way pass is prime and way too old for a real fight....
Is 3 quarters of this match literally the rocks intro? 😂
Nobody cares about Cody frfr his family has been pawns in wrestling for decades 😂
Go check it guys
There is a big cheat here the referee had already counted to 3
Even though it’s scripted it is still very much entertaining  I enjoyed the match and thank WWE for making the match long.
The crowd was so flat at the end.
Awesome match will see Bloodline Rules At WrestleMania Night 2 Tomorrow Will Be The End☝️☝️
Poor Rocky could barely raise his leg for the People's Elbow
I knew it the rock wins
Fricking Lawrence is a betreyer He Sold the match
Look at these cody baby mania fans, ha ha ha, dead, they made this mania xxsmall just like I said. Mania isnt even trenfing for most ppl on the tube.cody defo needs to lose or priest needs to take the tittle off him straight away.
Rock and Roman 🩸 vs  Kane and Undertaker. 💥   Who do you got??
🖤 u Rock🙌🙌
Welcome to the WWE Renaissance Era
Cody and Seth look like drag queen with that on
Esa presentación estuvo bien.
He shouldnt have ended the match with the Tribal Elbow.
Did yawl not notice the rock mom behind him when he was standing on that 1st table next to the Spanish announcer
Philadelphia is the worst crowd on earth. Don't ever do a WrestleMania or any other show there again. Just spoiled the whole show
The Rock is gonna win the title tonight. He will probably "cash in" if you know what I mean.
John Cena retirement match Vs The Rock would be epic. The People's Championship on the line.
Honest question from someone who doesnt really follow anymore but....the WM is bring hyped as the biggest but isnt it too predictable woth everyone knowing Roman/Rock was gonna win night 1 and badically everyone knows Cody is gonna win night 2?
Fantastic match 👏 👌 👍 🙌 ❤....Roman and rock are unstoppable 👏 🙌 💪 👌
Why the Rock has a Belt?? 🤔
Rocky looked great and the fact that he took the Rock Bottom through the announce table was perfect. Excellent match, can’t wait to see Cody win tonight!
How can it be allowed that the rock can prevent the referee from counting
The Rock's entrance was epic. 🔥🔥 Fantastic match. The Rock was great.
Rhodes will win at Night 2
Cine🗿
The Greatest Entertainer of All time   The Rock Johnson
You Count You Fire🤣
Sadly this match was surprisingly disappointing. The nostalgia was high with the rock wrestling but in truth I would rate his performance in that match right up there with hulk hogan. He showed a ton of ring rust and it seemed like the others were carrying him for much of the match. Gunther vs Sami should have been the main event as it clearly could have been a far more epic finish to the first night.
Personally i dont think ot would mean as much if cody won a fair fight tonight.   No rules goes both ways
His entrance wow
Everything about the Rocks entrance was amazing, except when he said Final boss engaged. Kinda ruined it for me
Wow. That was awful. Between the crowd and the match. Wrestling is dead sport.
Drama
This match had a few moments where you can tell the rock was a bit rusty but overall a phenomenal match. Also notice how this is a regular tag match yet none of the typical tag match rules applied. Roman and Rock both wrestling same time then Roman just gets tagged in like what 😂 but it was entertaining
The Rocks intro be longer then his matches 😂😂😂
Rock and Roman should have been the main event. Cody and Rollins are not on their level at all. Going to be a boring unrealistic win for Cody tomorrow unless the rock screws Roman then it might be a decent story but I can’t see wwe doing it
Philly crowd sucked. They don't deserve a Wrestlemania.
Final boss didn't come to play if u count you're fired 🔥 🤣🤣🤣
Can someone explain to me why they are dressed like that ? lol
Senaryo çoktan belli değilmiydi zaten 🙄 Cody kazandı sayarım
😆😆😆😆😆
Stupid wresle mania
the rock and romen cheating booooo i dont like
The Rock overdid himself with that entrance.  Lol. The flame botch was a sign it was a smidgen too much. If it's intentional, it's great storytelling. And carrying a belt around looking like the co-champion to finish the job of overshadowing Roman is Hogan-level. Hogan was always there to block Savage's shine. Cody could be in trouble as the Mega Powers storyline played out over a year.  They may want to do the same with Rock & Roman, even with the entire world rooting for Cody.
まだロック頼みなのかよ。
ignoring the crowd, this has to be one of the best wrestlemania main event of all time
The fact rock needed to come out with a belt makes his ego trip just even more sad 😂
Can't wait for Cody to win tonight and send Roman, and Rock to Hollywood 🤣🤣🤣
I HATE THAT CODY WILL WIN TOMORROW BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT ALLOW HHH GOLDEN BOY TO BE PINNED BACK TO BACK
😅😅😅😅😅
This was the best fight of the night 💯
THE FINAL BOSS THE ROCK HAS THE BEST INTRO I HAVE EVER SEEN HEADS DOWN AND THATS SAYING A LOT
Even during Rock's prime, i can't remember the last time he pinned someone using the People's Elbow
No matter who wins priest will cash in 🤷🏽‍♂️
Lmfao rock wonder y u wanted tag match u cant hack it one on one , wiuld of been better rock vs cody one on one should if left roman /rollins out this i say  oh well its just pretend like always rock wants wwe fans money font care about anybody else but himself
The "Biggest Tag Team Match of all time" between Roman Reigns and The Rock against Cody Rhodes and Seth "Freakkin" Rollins, was absolutely incredible and absolute CINEMA. The Rock looks so strong in this match. Roman Reigns get his 1000th win in WWE. Cody Rhodes lost last night, he better finish the story tonight. Man, this match was Awesome.
Cody Rhodies , Seth Rollins ❤🎉 power .
07:17 The Ref turning into Randy "the Viper" Orton there for a couple secs was hilarious! 😜😜😂😂
Seth can Dress up what
you notice that the rock help cody when roman locking him on submission dragging him into side preventing referee from counting or doing anything 🤔🤔🤔🤔 they could easily win on that, smell what betrayal the rock is cooking...
6:59 when I got to go work
The Rock should stay in the movie business
So Cody really screwd tonight?........................
The Rock will get payback on Roman on night 2 and fkin Rock bottom Roman
This is rubbish ehy the cheat always
Great match, but I could definitely see rocks ring rust
That was so good
This match was absolutely solid, and I enjoyed every second of it. Can't wait for tonight.
If you smell….. commercial. Damn youtube
Cody ain’t finishing his story yall stay mad like the clowns you are 🤡
The new era 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Bravo Rock and Roman Reigns.God bless.
Cheater boss👎👎👎
Boring crowd
The rock is lagenda respect stamina the rock is osem........the rock is cooking......
cheat to win to old to win the right way
Being 40 now, it felt so damn good to be back, enjoying this match with you all! This is home; You all are my people!
Rollins vs Reigns in a single match should main event a WrestleMania someday!
When roman reigns spear the causin the rock is like crying like child 😅😅😅😅
Man that was a fantastic match. I liked how the rock ended the match rather then roman. It shows the rock is the final boss
You know Cody won Roman reigns last time it’s just because of that stupid bloodline member solo sikoa and today he could’ve won with the 3 crossroads and guess what he got hit with the belt again so he technically won both
Man! The Rock's Fit looks so damn Good.
Cheating bro
That's what am talking about Roman Reigns and The Rock All the way 😃💪👍🔥
NO THEY BROUGHT BACK THE HOLLYWOOD THEME
My god the crowd is dead? We could hear The Rock talking to referee 😂
the story has com to the end😢😢😢😢😢
The Rock and Roman ❤❤
what is this crowd? :I It's a shame!
Rock Rocky Rock Bottom ⚡️⚡️⚡️💪💪💪💥
Man I freaking loved that crowd's energy and the intros were immaculate especially Rock's, Tonight is definitely a chance for Cody to pick back up where they left at. 🔥🔥
Is that 2Chains😂 ?
😮❤🎉 Cody Rhodes e Final Boss 🙊
Escenarios de nxt ese wm zzzz y el público lo peor muy apagado
So stupid
Have you noticed Reigns' body build? He is not okay.
Rocky Rocky Rocky Rocky Rockk😂
Rock is sucks he is a big cheater👎
Was this a no DQ match?? The Rock hitting Cody with the belt should've been a DQ...just sayin
For all you cody crybabies let me drop some gospel on you yall can quote this " you know what happens when you finish a story? you stop reading the book" think about that
I guess this means cody wins tomorrow.
YES YES YES!!
Let’s go Cody
Have to admit… I’m digging the whole “Final Boss” thing.
Wrestlemania 40?
9:03 Reigns getting up so quickly from TWO Cross Rhodes made Cody's finisher look weak
The Rock just turned the match from normal to No DQ and the poor ref couldn’t do anything about it
The crowd turned on Cody. They wanted him in the Main Event, now this. Bunch of backstabbers.  Also; it's crowds like that, makes me feel ashamed to be a WWE fan.
This was always gonna happen Cody roads obv gonna beat them all tomorrow
Cody fans are probably rioting rn 💀
Bro Crowd Are Sleeping I Don't Like It Look If Crowd Chanting And Give Some Hype The Match Will Be So Great But Even The Rock And Others Not Feeling The Energy Of People's Meh This Country Not Belongs To The Wrestlings
The Thumbnail though with the rocks face lol
The Rock looked really good in that match considering he hadn’t wrestled for so long looked better than cm punk
Nice
This match was so bad considering the build. Cody losing was dumb. Rollins should have tapped and left cody mad going I gotta defend my title tomorrow. Cody is a dork 😂😂😂
Board members, partial owners and Bosses including the final Boss should not be alowed to wrestle at all. The Rock needs to choose between being a wrestler or a WWE board member.. He can't do both. If he continues to both  WWE is has not only lost credibility as Fake Entertainment Wrestling. It has become nothing more then a very bad circus act.
The rock vs mama rhodes night 2 🗿
What a match
1st night is Infinity War : Good Guys lose 2nd night is Endgame : epic comeback Big Bad sees his downfall
What made him think pedigreeing the rock would look good lmfao, he's still way to small
esse Seth Rollins mais esse Code Rhodes aí já estava enchendo o saco viu como aquele carniça lá Gunther
i hope tonight's prt 2, actually provides the WrestleMania experience we have come to expect or even better. as so far,m the match itself from last night was just meh given all the hype and buildup
The fact the Rock Coaching the future Stars how it's done is hilarious 😂
Never have an event in philly the crowd is boring
Love how sneaky Seth Rollins is
Lame
If the WWE universe script I believe Cody Rhodes will win 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
This has to be the greatest rock wrestlemania entrance of all time
8:12 what did Cody say to to the Rock there? xD
nice show
The Rock only exposed how midcard Seth and Cody are. These wrestling fans will just eat whatever is spoonfed to them
Great match but the peoples elbow from snoop dog last year was better
I love that belt
Wow, just wow
This match was epic incredibly entertaining
やっぱりヒールでもロック様を応援してしまう！愛してるぜ
What title did the rock have
Rock lil bald headed clown 😅
ロッキーロッキー
Most horrible channel WWE
The rock  is very  disrespectful
Never have mania at Philly AGAIN
That rock bottom through the table was epic 😂
Everyone says the crowd was bad, I think it’s the outdoor arena. Sound traveled upward where if it was in a closed arena we would’ve heard them better. I thought tonight was pretty good.
This is what The Tribal Chief should be Big, strong, angry and evil I think grey is good for his hairs
Cody’s odds of leaving with the belt just skyrocketed
Toujours la bloodline il n'y aura plus de nouveaux champions ,ni de suspense.tant que les stars travailleront toujours en groupe.dommage trop de business
BS
The Rock’s entrance was incredible.
WWE 2k25 final boss
Cody with the rock bottom on the Rock was epic 😊
Yessss❤
Maybe it's because it's an outdoor stadium or something but crowd seems subdued...last night was legendary !!!
Just a question but can Goldust come to help cody in night 2?. He is family for cody, I know he is with AEW but maybe there can be a possibility to just interfere in cody's favor, just for a one night stand. It could be amazing to see goldust do his shattered dreams to the rock!!
ain’t gonna lie, that belt the rock had looked nice.
Where seth?
❤❤100 millones 🆒😎
That was without a doubt one of the most meh wrestlemania's I have ever seen. There are sooooo many other wrestlers soooo much more deserving of a main event spot than DeWayne. DeWayne took zero bumps, and is nothing more than a shell of the athlete he once was. And because he is so limited in what he can do now, it holds back the other wrestlers who could be doing sooo much more if they had someone like Ricochet to work with. The Rock is at best a mid card performer now, and the only reason he still has the main event spotlight is because he sold out to corporate Baallywood and their milking his Baallywood character for every penny they can possibly get before his body starts to shrivel just like all the other bloated steroid freaks have done.
Rock proved at 51 he is at that 4head mountain.
Paul heymand at 7:20 Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh😂
Philly sucks
The Rock still got It The Final Boss
This is the end of rock's career with disney😅😅😅
🗣️All is Real!!! ☝🏻🤨
Way too many sponsors around the ring
The final boss pining Cody Rhodes 1 2 3 is best for business
Lol...by far match of the night😀🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 wow... 9/10
I’m sick of the tribal chief moniker and the rock just needs to go back to Hollywood he doesn’t belong in the ring anymore
That 1-2-3 was so fast off the people elbow 😆
Always someone block his 3cross roads
Time for triple H
We want Rocky！Cody Suck！ We want Rocky！Cody Suck！ We want Rocky！Cody Suck！ 。。。🎉🎉🎉
Rock bottom threw the table and spear threw the barricade is the planning level of the attitude era we back lol
Only Stone Cold can now stop the bloodline on night 2.
It was Bloodline rules already, wonder what night 2 will really be like.
What a rock bottom from Cody 8:14 😮
Now The Rock is back will they have to stop drug testing? Man is stacked!
Got 1 result wrong but im still adamant cody is winning tommorow Which i dont want
Seth Rollins barely helped Cody that match😂
Rock the fraud.
Rocks face don’t look scary anymore 😂
How the hell does cody get pinned by just a people’s elbow
when cody tries to do three cross rhodes in a row qnd backs but to the ropes it never ends good😂
Es una porquería este show ya me aburrió seguir mirando a los mismos ganar no sirve esto que verdadera por quería lo mismo pasara hoy ganara román ya me  se el resultado para que lo veo
Cody won last night if it wasn’t for rock. Roman has lost to Cody multiple times at this point. It’s over for Roman Sunday.
It's the Rock's wide open mouth for me @ 6:59 😂😅
Bruh i really wanted Cody to win the universal title tomorrow
YEEEESSSSSS BLOODLINE
Cena tries to help then all of a sudden the lights go out, bong the undertaker appears after a few minutes of fighting, glass smashes Austin 3:16! I can’t wait
The Roman uppercuts r the best🔥
The worst wrestlemania of all time
You have Rock, Rhodes, Rollins and reigns and u have the worst crowd ever
The People’s Belt is 🔥 🔥 🔥
Dead crowd
Philadelphia is the worst. Never do WrestleMania there again
Honestly the whole 'final boss' and videogame references make me feel like the Rock is straight up stealing from Kenny Omega
His enterance is just simply flames ❤❤go ROCK lay the smack down !!!
it’s clear rhodes goin beat reigns now smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
Enough Cody rhodes.... pick someone stronger, meaner to take down rock n reigns.....
It was obvious thoo😢
☝🏼
and now tonight we will see Roman Vs Cody on Bloodline rules , and i think we will see some RLLY excited helps or returns to help Cody , hmmm .. Lets see if Brock Lesnar will come and help Cody and do some F5s on The Rock ,  who dosent want to see that ?
Hope he can finish his story
This was the greatest tag match of all time! 🔥🗣️
😂
The Philly crowd was really disappointing. The city is famous for it's rowdy crowd and we get the most mid, phone-addicted audience in a long while.
Rock just left himself speared 😅😅😅😅😅😅
Cody goin to win their making the script as if he has zero change and beats all odds
Crowd was awful . Don’t have it there anymore
Aew to the wold
Philly fans are and will always be, the worst fans on earth
The Rock belt better than WWE title belt.👍
What great selling by The Rock for the accidental spear, I thought rocks couldn't scream
that's a dangerous move the crossroads....good thing they rehearse it lol
The rock betrays the bloodline on night two
😂 the best match
Cody botched the Cody cutter at least twice, looks out of shape too.
Cody failed on night one but I know deep inside in night two cody will successfully pin roman reigns with a little bit of help from you know who😎
Roman shames and the crock
When Cody loses tomorrow it’s gonna be crazy 😂
04:29 the new mr mcmahon but more stronger🤣🤣
LMAO 🤣 ANKLE BITER ON THE ROCK AT 8:02
I'm sure.. Tomorrow not only jay uso and Seth weren't only ones who came for Cody's back up..
Great match Deadass crowd
This storyline is getting so old
YES THE ROCK AND ROMAN REIGNS WON
Cody whispering in the rock ear before rock bottom
LMFAO LISTEN TO 7:42 SOMEONE YELLS FROM THE CROWD LOOK AT YOUR SON ...😂 THIS MATCH KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER
This means Cody is winning tonight
I’m ready for Roma’s Rein to end
The Rock should seek some Mental Health lessons... dude is fkin on roids and not even worth it anymore
so sad cody's story line is just pointless.
Why does the Roc people's title look more like an actual World title than the actual belts?????
What belt is the rock holding?
If Cody lose tomorrow, then it means Roman will keep the belt until next wrestlemania against Rock. It's certain for the tribal chief position. ❤❤❤❤I love wwe
Cody WILL overcome the odds and finish his damn story tonight.
Come al solito vincono scorrettamente, avevano già chiuso il match due volte
Yo the rock just said if you count your fired😂
What a match
🤢🤢🤢🤢rock
Silly play, getting more boring,wwe insists to make roman a super hero
I’m not going to lie but this crowd is wack what happened to Philadelphia
The Rock is not as athletic as he was when he faced Cena back in 2013 but he was able to do great in this match given he’s much bigger and is in his 50s now. Easily Rock’s best run since 2004.
so tomorrow cody borther will come and save him -_-
Its wrestlemania and they show the pins
BORING
Night 1 had good matches, but this match, the Bianca/Jade/Nomi match and Sami Zayn matches we're great. Also the Awesome Truth winning the Raw tag titles was also a great moment.
I don’t want the rock back 😢
5 star classic for me but the crowd just ruined wrestlemania the match was 🔥🔥🔥
Roman reigns respect's his cousin the Rock more than anybody
Best match of all time
Boring
Crowd was horrible
Screw the rock  Cody had the win  & now he is abusing his  power that’s messed up
Philly was a terrible choice for wrestlemania the crowd was quite literally the worst I’ve ever seen, period. Take elimination chamber last year I believe? I don’t think it’s been two years but take the crowd during the Sami zayn Roman reigns match…and if that’s the standard this crowd was the total opposite. They even booed George kittle, bc they are still so butthurt from their garbage team getting exposed for what they always were, GARBAGE! Their fans GARBAGE, the crowd literally kinda had me thinking I didn’t enjoy what I was watching. Philly peeps are just a different kind of stupid.
When the rock whipped cody with thd belt standing outsidd the ring i peed my pants from laughing
The best match of night 1.....hands down....now for WWE not to screw up night 2.
It's was a Big match
"If you count, you’re fired!" 😂😂😂
wwe is fake
The Rock's entrance is freaking awesome and blew my mind
6:59 The Rock acting like he got stabbed 🤣🤣
Cody Cody Cody 🎉🎉
Real winner cody 🥳
Wrestling is so horrible like how do people now a days watch this
LMFAO 🤣 LOOK at your son has to be the greatest liner the rock has ever said
Somebody needs to save Cody tonight 2
Roman and Rock Legendary Familly☝🏼🩸
I expected Cody to lose Night 1 and win on Night 2. That clearly is the direction this is going. And I think Drew Mcintyre is going to beat Seth Rollins and will be immediately cashed in on by Damien Priest.
"If you count I will fire you" -THE Final Boss" THE ROCK!😂
When The Final Boss Is Here, The Rest Remains Silent 🤫  The People’s Champion and The Decision Maker 💪🏼  Basically; Know Your Role and Shut Your Mouth 🤐
After  a awful display by the referee's,  and by the wwe company in the Cody Rhodes  ,rock Rollins and Raines match this view will no longer  support  or watch wwe .
Últimamente no megusta los jefe tribal
I’m gonna be picky here. But the prime logo in the middle of the ring and all the sponsorships surrounding totally threw me off. Night one was barely mediocre imo 😟 definitely didn’t feel like last year.
Cody Rock Bottom The People's champion The Rock. -Cody Story!😂
What a boring crowd!
Muy idiotas yo pense que codhy y seth le iban a dar corrrea a esos dos rebeldes de mierda 😅😅😢😢
Cody. Whatever happens on day 2, you have to end Roman reigns
If Cody wins despite it being a Bloodline Rules, then this victory would have been for nothing XD
8:56 that belt shot from rock to Cody had my back stinging last night. I know everybody felt that one.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
who won I missed the match😢
Je savais qu’ils vont gagner se match🥳🥳🥳mais j’ai tellement peur pour aujourd’hui roman❤❤❤❤
Are you not entertained? 🤯
I know it’s the least important thing but I’m sorry..change the ring back!! Omg 😤😂
Lmfao  that face The Rock made when he got Speared.....
I hope Roman will sell moves more. He get 2 cross rhodes and not even selling
Did they mute the crowd for the broadcast? That people's elbow was silent
Wow..verry entertainment..love that
Ma il conto dell’arbitro era già a tre   Questo dimostra la pagliacciata di questo show 😅.   Comunque da parte da Cody era già tre
I’m thinkin the The Rock is gonna screw Roman over, but then I’m thinkin Damian is gonna cash in towards the end.
The rock seemed better in this match then he did against cena
Reigns and rock cheats like rest of the buttline not bloodline
Please WWE, no more open stadiums please. It kills the crowd "pop".
The rocks entrance was great
All these led boards and prime sponsors everywhere is garbage
فخامة ابناء الجزيرة المسيطرين ❤
W❤
FINALLY............ it seems like they are making an effort to make it watchable again. Kayfabe is all but dead so lean into the stories more and government us some real entertainment.  We know some of these athletes get on and some don't, contrary to the stories they are telling.
what a joke
The rock sold that spear like heck 😂
Roman win tmr, but rock gonna turn on him after the match because of the spear tonight. Rock gonna take the title next (maybe by help of Cody). And Cody gonna challenge the final boss again for the title
hi😊
The Rock wasn't "selling" that spear. It genuinely hurt like hell.
IM CALLING IT NOW. MJF DEBUTS TOMORROW TO HELP CODY HAHA
This boring crowd doesnt deserve to see the end of roman reigns live
4:02 holded
Philly doesnt deserve another wrestlemania ever again man. But i feel like romans gonna drop the chip to cody and possibly retire, ive been noticing that hes lost a good amount of weight, especially in his face, which tells me hes having a fight with his leukemia again😢 i hope thats not the case though prayers up
This is why i stopped watching. Stop pushing roman. Horrible storyline. Horrible wrestler. Horroble promo. He has such a boring moveset
Massive props to The Rock. Given his age and the long layoff, he delivered. Was a solid match. The Philly crowd were a huge let down though.
Wwe selling liquid cancer to kids
Pathetic lmao
8:55  Uffff
I'm actually shocked the Rock can still move in the ring for his age.
Another poor Ppv from WWE
Rocky was wearing the old school Rock trunks. Love the Brahma bull!
Lmfao 🤣 that face The Rock made when he got Speared.....
The Rock's entrance🥶
disappointed
disgusting, they cheated throughout the match, Reigns and Rock also cheated on Bloodline last year and now it's about that, and Cody and Seth would have won 😢
Bad WM main Event Ever👎👎goodbye WWE
I really liked this match, it delivered for me! :)
Crazy
I was gone ask, when did the Rock get a belt? Than I realized I knew better. 🤦🏾‍♂️😂😂
いよいよ明日、ストーンコールドオースチンが来るぞ
The Bloodline ☝️☝️
I Just Watched The Match And It Was Amazing 🤩
Have a feeling MJF will debut and either help cody win or screw him
And this is why The Rock is one of the 🐐🐐🐐🐐
THE ROCK WILL BETRAYED ROMAN TOMORROW 😂😂😂 THIS IS FOR ALL OF YOU CODY CRY BABIES 🤣🤣🤣
Congrats to The Rock and Roman Reigns , the final boss did an amazing job as always , a well deserved win
8:12 Cody: "Ready?"
Tu es vraiment génial, j'apprécie beaucoup ta façon d'expliquer. Sincères félicitations
Well, at least rock sealed it with a people's elbow
This match is more like a tornado tag team kkkk
Finally the announcer table didn't break when the rock try to rock bottom on it🤣
Its over cody , 😂😂😂😂, you are a number 2, boodline rules boy!
Yes Team bloodline/ smackdown worked better team Rollins (Raw)
Ngl, I was hoping to see a fair match tbh..
Hope roman and rock will face off " Refrence to the Rock's song Face Off"
I am ready to see the glass shatter tomorrow and Stone Cold comes in to give a hand to Cody.
Rock. Is. Best
The rock gets more jacked the older he gets… makes no damn sense
Think it’s time for international WrestleMania….I remember London being hyped entire show when they hosted Money in the Bank last year  Not so much Philly. All the energy during WrestleMania World interviews….dead and silent when main event of night 1 rolls around. Smh
💥 If Roman wins tomorrow, I will *QUIT WATCHING WRESTLING* and will *_START WATCHING ANCIENT ALIENS_* ..
Things that could happen Sunday Hogan or Sting or Stone Cold could appear...
Ok, so The Rock is turning on Roman tomorrow somehow and establishes himself as head of the family, bunch of people returning.. going to be THE match of Wrestlemania.
Wht title as the rock got
I think it will be difficult for Cody to become champion anymore.
Never understood the logic in having wrestling rules, and then people clearly break them, and in the story the officials let it happen then.
Seth🔥🔥
Wish there was a legal  betting line on who would win.!!
Talk is cheap Cody, You have no story to finish!
I knew from start that roman and the rock will win
How the rock get that belt?
Yayy roman and the rock are my fav
Wow I will keep on watching wwe
Crowd sucked
Why is the crowd booing Cody tho?
A wise man aka CM Punk once said, "there's always next year"  So maybe cody, seeya next year 😂
The crowd wasn't dull the match wasn't fair.
Now bring my childhood back and have stone cold turn up and ruin the bloodline!!!
The Rock is real stupid
Thanks Rock ,Tannks Roman, Tanks WWE 🫶🏻
This means Cody is winning tonight
Roman is starting to be like his father with the fluffy hair😅❤️
🔔🔚
f5...tomorrow night😂
Aye my comment might go unnoticed.  But I'm a legit fan as well.... been watching rock since I was about 8. I watched everything he's done (wrestling wise) always thought once he went hollywood he didn't have have that same passion he proved us wrong.   He went hard.
The Crowd was Boring  , like Really  Dead .. Moving Wrestle Mania to VEGAS DESERT
☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼
🎉🎉🎉
Watching from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Rock and Roman win, the match between Cody and Roman is utter carnage, bloodline members attacking Cody constantly, there's no way he can win, he keeps fighting, heart of a champion. Just when it seems like there's no hope, Cody betting beat down by Rock and Roman, and Solo etc etc.  * Glass shatters *  Stone Cold clears the ring, Cody manages to hit Roman with the final finisher, 1, 2, 3.
99.99% chance the Rock is going to turn on Roman tomorrow
That crowd were terrible more pop in a soda can
Is it me or did this recording sound like it actually caught the crowd noise?  Watching on peacock you could barely hear the crowd like this
Why is the audio on the stream on wwe network completely out of sync???
Thanks WWE for posting such a detailed video of the match. It's appreciated.
عالی بود ❤😂
the ref also did a great job
Having to watch this after the network resumed my watching from the wrong point and spoiled the result for me and then the audio went half hour out of sync making it unwatchable. way to go, wwe
Is it me or did this match seem so flat and slow, don’t know if it was the crowd or what but something just didn’t seem right.
I Said it yesterday and say it it today Philly as a crowd and as Fans is  so below average and phily sucks
Cody👎👎👎
This match was a no disqualification match and The Bloodline (which was The Rock and Roman Reigns) had a stipulation that if they win the match then they would be The Bloodline Rules which would have all members of The Bloodline who would have to help Roman Reigns to retain the Undisputed WWE Universal Title as long as Roman Reigns is still the champion and there is nothing that Cody Rhodes can do about that situation at WrestleMania 40
The crowd are dead 😂
Yep cody definitely wining on night 2💯
The rock is at this prime I think but 1999 it's good
what a sh@tty crowd
6:50 이거 보고 로만 팬이 있긴 있었구나 라는 걸 깨닫게 됐습니다..
Whole locker room comes out in support of Cody today? or the dream, Brock shows up to help 👀
Who is ready to see Steve Austin and cena help Cody win ?
Philly  was just chants of ecw and cm punk they leather show down
Vin diesel does wrestling? I know him from Moana and jumanji
진짜 이판은 대놓고 권력게임 역대급 노잼 레슬매니아였어
👆
Nt the ppl elbow, the bloodline elbow
Pick warmer locations or closed roof arenas, the freezing cold suppressed the crowd energy a bit. But great show
I'm too sleepy to watch this ,, cause I'm from Indonesia and I think this match begin in 04:00 cause WWE YouTube live in that hrs ,, but the reality is the match begin in 09 am 😢 I'm not sleep just for this match 😢 and unfortunately Cody and Seth beaten by Rocky and Reigns
The close up camera angles they use so much these days really kills the illusion ☹️. I know we know but jeez.
Great main event but please... Tripl h Stop the pub in ring
Cody not surviving  He needs back up real bad
7:02 I could feel his pain
Tomorrow night get ready for the big "Avengers Assemble" moment WWE style..
rematch cause the referee didn't count 😊
The Rocks face when he gets speared priceless hell of a performance 😂😂😂😂😂
The crowd was SO DEAD that’s why the UK deserves a WrestleMania it would be so much more fun.
They really accomodated The Rock by pacing this match. Very smart. It helped the Rock get his groove back
자 이제 대관식 잘 치뤄주면 된다 wwe야? 아니 더 락아? 알아들었지? 이번에 개병신같이 하면 진짜 더 락 넌 wwe 영구 퇴출은 물론이고 tko 이사? 팬들이 가만 내버려두지 않을 거다. 이건 경고야 더 락아. 너가 이렇게 분위기 만들어주고, 프로모도 기깔나게 해준 건 팬으로써 참 좋았고 재밌었지만 대관식은 잘 치뤄줘야 한다. 안그러면 크게 후회할 거다...
It’s confirmed Dustin is interfering
the announcer is terrible
قويه
What did they expect The rock has an contract that states he can't lose a fight.
This match started slow and uninteresting but once they left the ring the whole mood and pace changed
Super the rock match
CAN'T STAND THE ZOOMING IN AND OUT ACTION CAMERAS. Part of the reason why i can't stand watching this.
Q haga quien sea el finished pero ya la roca ya no es  como antes, ya cae verga!!
The Rock is still the Champ.. ❤❤
With how Rock used his power in the match, I can already see where tonight is going. Cody wins but Rock will revert the decision.
Sponsorships. Sponsorships everywhere
Same scenario, same triviality, with the same clown
Why do crowds film at this event? It’s televised
Am i the only one that noticed this? As the rock is walking passed the audience, that everyone is OBESE? 😮
The rock says that night two of wrestlemania its bloodline rules if he and roman reigns win this match maybe they will decide which match is going to be for the wwe champion
4:36 what a funny character, the wrestler that can fire the people who are there to make sure match is alright
The rock can still make a full time come back
2 consecutive crossroads and they didn’t really look very effective. I hope Cody unleashes a new finisher once he becomes champ.
Wrestling version of the MCU Infinity War & Endgame!
MAMA RHODES 😂
I wish cm punk was somehow involved in this story. Well at least we get to see him in the commentary.
That crowd. 😴 Youre at Wrestlemania for gods sake.
3:39 that's not looking like a body and skin of a 51 years old dude. He must be working SO HARD to get and keep that shape, doing SO MANY Sacrifices and getting all kinds of drugs to be able to perform
Something tells me there’s a receipt coming to Roman from Rock for the spear tomorrow.
The Rock is awesome!  Imagine Wrestlemania if he would have fought Hulk Hogan.  That match would have been awesome!
The rock is so hot ❤
Everyone feels good when The rock comeback with new theme song
Make yOur own rules as you go now i see 🙈 Bs to all of us who wanted paw patrol to kick Romans azz
Glad to see bloodline☝️ win beat this bighead 🤡 seth n crybabies 😅
Book it WWE book it Triple H
6:59 this was the best sold out spear bro😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉
Not seeing flashing cameras at 10:16 is a little weird ngl
The Rock is the great one Amazing Charackter the Final Boss i hope Roman wins for a long Bloodline story and new Members for the Bloodline Jey uso back the Rocks Daughter and other Bloodlines
Underwhelming at best
Rock's a true menace as a heel
Wwe is fake because cody Win wwe champ tomorrow
I mean, WWE has heard of Philly crowds before, right. This is the town that hates santa claus. Lol... I realize that people travel from all over to see Wrestlemania,  but still a Philly-feel. I imagine a Chicago crowd would be more receptive
Have mania in London I promise u wind won’t stop us from being heard
8:10 that guy filming the girl filming the wrestlers...?
Bloodline always cheating  I hope cody would cheat and win this Sunday
A better match than I expected but still too many re-used spots and the same old finish. Literally just another episode of SmackDown! Stale rivalry, stale match, stale finish, I'm giving 3/10. And 2 points came from the Rock.
Forehead stomp looked sick af🔥
Why is Dwayne with a belt though? Is he a champion or something?
Proper fix
Night one was meeeh
Everyone knows that that's currently-  The C0ck.  Right?
I feel betrayed by wwe at this point.
Ok idc THE ROCK got the coolest entrance now
I think people don't realise the fitness level of the Rock, this man is god damn 51y of age put some solid as* respect on his name
I’ll say it as you’re all thinking it; the production is lacking this year. It doesn’t feel ‘special’ like other manias.
Bruh this crowd sucked
How many midroll ads have you crammed into this one
Uhhh wtf is this. Damn how the mighty have fallen
Black adam is the final boss
The plot twist when they didn't destroy the Spanish announce table.
# no rock gang
Nah....this show is taking soo long.....
Crowd was 👎 match was amazing! Well done to all!
The rocks face after roman speared him😅😂😂😂😂😂😂
WWE please get rid of the advertising from around the ring and inside of the ring.  No need for it.  As for the crowd, very disappointed.  Biggest wrestlemania and they weren't arsed.
I’m afraid Cody Rhodes can’t win The Bloodline Rules Match but… he needs a backup. It’s the only way to win and I know he will win but if he loses again, it’s over. Let’s face it, Roman’s right about this. We’re doomed…
Yeah ☝🏻☝🏻
Roman is winning this tonight
Night one full of mehhh matches 🤷‍♂️ sad but true.
boooooooo the rock booo 🤬🤬😡
Does Philadelphia even like WWE? The crowd acted like they had nothing better to do and decided to just hang out together and WrestleMania XL just happened to be occuring in the background 😂
4:28 Something I never saw triple h did
… … …
The final elbow baby!
Cody. Is. Screwed. 😂😂😂
What did Cody said to the Rock at 8:12?
Can see the Rock being the last disruption in the main event, only he's gonna screw over Reigns so he gets a match against Reigns for the Chiefdom of the Table.
Boring match of the rock in WWE 🤮👎👎👎
Roman will win today again🎉🎉🎉❤😅😊
Hahaha boring The rock retired now
Winnie harlow❤😊
boring
Roman Reigns is physically in the best shape of his reign so far cuz wow the abs are there now 🔥☝️🐐
Rock pinning Cody last night was a statement to all those who threatened his daughter!
Its over for cody rhodes 😞
What a dead crowd.
Bloody hell why they all dressed like that
In my opinion, Gunther and Sami had the best match of night 1 and this match is number 2 cuz Gunther never disappoints
Match was awesome, but the one thing that annoyed me during the match was Pat McAfee and Corey Graves's constant sucking up and arse kissing to The Rock and Roman Reigns.
I found out now that we were deprived of enjoyable entertainment for many years without this man the Final Boss, he's the  top of the top.   ￼
That ring announcer is awful....😂😂😂
Fix the audio on the app already!!!
Fix the damn audio on the app
This is the second Wrestlemania where Cody has delivered two crossrhodes in a row, only for Roman to spear him right after. Makes his finisher seem so weak.
The SLAP heard all around the World😮 8:58
Not crowd night one was boring last match worse
The Rock tagged Roman after being tagged in. He isn't the legal man!!! Cody's pin doesn't count!!!
This man came back and took over 25 back bumps, a stomp, a pedigree, a spear, a Rock Bottom through the announce table, and a people's elbow INTO a Cody Cutter.  Match delivered in every way.
I feel sad for Cody Rhodes😢😢. He not face Roman one on one, he need to face The Rock, Solo, Jimmy and Heyman. One vs Five.
my wwe network on demand coverage started to go weird on this main event so ive had to come here disappointing that is.
You still got it Rocky 😢
Missed match 😔
People on here knowing its Philadelphia but expecting puerto rico lmao
The Rock rinobirira.
If Roman wins tomorrow, then they're pulling the trigger for Roman knocking out Hogan in the top 3.  Hogan, Backlund, Sammartino.  I seriously don't know if WWE will actually do that.
You can tell the rock got on a badass gear cycle for this. Probably GH test, and masteron at good doses. I don’t see the need for a older guy to do tren
Oh The Rock can definitely still go! I had no doubts!
You count you fired..sound like mr mc.mahon😂😂😂
Don't wañna live anymore. Gonna empty out med cabinet into my belly. Be cool and get along
I think the rock will turn on roman tommorow
The fan celebrating in front of Cody's mom😂😂😂
Im going to unsubscribe from wwe youtube channel honestly, i get a spoiler notification on my phone just as im watching the show on replay as i got home from work…what a joke..thanks wwe..this really pissed me off
Am i the only one seth superplex & falcon arrow the rock someday?
When the rock told the ref if u count u fired I lost it🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The venue, the crowd all are worst. Worst wrestlemania ever
Rollins went to sleep.
I need roman reings the winner
Yes!!!!!!!!!
If roman is still champ after night two smackdown for me is just not worth watching
Wrestlelamia : DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE !
Aw the rock wanted to bring out his ancient attitude era title back with him that’s cute 😂
Silly match
I think cody will still win against roman because i think like jey sami and kevin will come and even the odds
The match definitely delivered that was solid
And again roman and the rock cheated. It's just not fair
why was the crowd booing cody and rollins so bad? i’m confused at did i miss something?
شو هالمسخره هيي
The Rock should have been disqualified having heat Cody with that belt. Cody and Seth were screwed just as the commentator pointed.
Seeing him shirtless without filters being added in post production, everyone who still thinks Rock is natural is a complete idiot.
me so sad
well the night one was great for the rock. just let him enjoy his wm moment after manu years not wrestling
it was the show of Satanism, red costumes, Naomi, Bianca and Jade doing the 666 with their hands at the end of the match and Gunther losing the title after 666 days...
☝🏽☝🏽☝🏽
Team Rhodes won and rock the referee and stopped the counting
Cmon Philly. Where’s the energy ⚡️
Cold is better  than roman❤
Wrestlemania 17,19 y xl lo mejores
Waht wath. Jhonson fair
JUST ONE QUESTION: WHY?! was it really necessary to put THAT MUCH ADVERTISING everywhere in the arena? like WTF?! that "american home shield" ad is just to much, all around the ring, even the apron, the ring posts.. i can't believe what i'm seeing. this is clearly to much. and then the prime logo in the middle of the ring, and also on the turnbuckles.. maaan, come on! was that really necessary?!
The Rocks over selling is horrendously bad.
Like if you saw Winnie Harlow ——>
I don't understand the meaning of this demonstration, it's a nonsense nonsense. I understand the show made in USA... but this is an insult to human intellect.
We are tired to see roman as a champion
Cody a schoolboy😂
Where was Seth Freaking Rollins?
Wayth Jhonson
Rock hasn’t lost his selling! 🤣
Like always wwe will hope randy saves the show. Putting him in US championship is a mistake.
Go figure let the bloodline win screw the bloodline and the rock
BORING
this is fn sadge....
Add the Rock to the list of fuxking legends of Flair, hogan, and taker! To perform at the level at that age only the goats did it..
They cheated period.  But  again what's n
Tbh Seth really don’t do much in these clips idk if he did in the real match
Cody's finished 😂😂😂
The Rock is the Goat!
Bloodline rules 🖕🖕🖕🖕
Surprised nobody's mentioned the rock's face in the thumbnail
nk stone cold no party
Wtf was that ending boo
I request if lk night could be the referee coze he can fight where necessary yeah
👇those who still think Cody will win
Cody still suck as always
Since when did the rock have  a belt
ehat an entrance of the rock..  wow
The crowd was weak as hell
Cody was always going to lose tonight to make tomorrow’s win that much bigger.
Watching the rock wrestling again is like watching hogan return in the early 2000’s you can he’s still got it but it won’t be long till he fully retires 😢.. but this version of the rock is up there with my favourite
Well u can't hate the rock and Roman reigns at the same time
The Rocks kills the American Nightmare?  And restore the American Dream?  Politics.
I still think Cody will win the title, They just did it to add intensity and drama to the main event
Rock is a coward as always , never win a championship never will. What a joke .
What's that belt he's carriying?
This easily has to be one of the greatest WM matches i've ever seen. How Cody & Roman can top this on Sunday I have no idea but I'm sure they will
Props for to the Rock for coming back and actually looking decent after 8 years
I am so bored of Roman. Has this not dragged on for long enough.
Not gonna lie seth and cody won because rock cheated
hey WWE there is a wrestling Match where your adverts should be
Am team Cody❤
It took like 800 chair shots to stone cold steve austin himself to defeat the rock a wrestlemania x7, tonight he got none. To roman, rollins and cody this was the worst night in their lives, to the rock, who fought Dx alone for a whole year and defeated them... It was just another saturday.
Why Seth wearing Becky's clothes at Wrestlemania like that. Not at Wrestlemania.
Peoples elbow was linda mid. Didnt even take the band off
If there’s anything wwe needs to take from njpw except wrestling quality matches, is how to make a big match feel big using the entrances, same way how Okada matches used to have the music intro before his actual theme played. Glad they did that for the rock
sami vs gunther set the bar high before this match thats why it was mid
Bloodline Rules Match? Sign me up for this?
one of the most electriying entrances in recent memory.
That's why UK crowd is the best😮 this crowd was dead
Rock is making more money 😅
Philly crowd was mid for and event like this the match was a great match hope code finally finish his story today
"Come on Rock, I'm just trying to do my job" 🤣
It was obvious in the end who was gonna win rick and Roman were Defo gonna win
This match was incredible. I did not expect it to be this good. Well done WWE!!!
bloodline rules it is now the doors open for cody cause not only can the bloodline insert themselves but so can everyone who's got a beef against them could be really bad for the bloodline actually i hope it is
YouTube: WWE, how many adverts would you like on your video? WWE: Yes
If Cody doesn't win tonight, WWE is stupid. They would spend all of there goodwill with fans in an instant. Roman is overplayed. The cheap wins are over done. Ther is a reason I watch free YouTube stuff. Don't wanna pay to see the garbage Reigns has been. Sammy is the reason this got to where it is.
The Final Elbow
People who saw this live heard The Rock say the F word without it being censored.  Lol
No Holds Barred
Crowd was awful
😠😠😠
John cena will return tmrw to help Cody win
Cody just laid there lol love the entertainment from the final boss! 😂
Wooooooo F%#$ beautiful
That matches pace to was like slow if you ask me it took the rock 10 years to transition to the peoples elbow and pin him that was basically the whole match
Esa entrada de the rock  Casi me hizo llorar de la emoción 😮 y tirarme del techo
Just as I predicted, roman and rock will win tonight but in day 2 codi will win
8:30 me holding the square button to land a hit
Cody will definitely defy the odds and win today.
Roman's hair was crazy 😂😂😂
Did anyone else see Pickleboy in the crowd?
Rock pulling out the ref is a classic
crowd sounds better in this video than i rememeber watching live
The disappointing part is the keep building  cody up like he's gonna win and beat roman. Man cody story bout to end as much as I which sucks  hate to see it .they not gone take anything from roman. .cody had to much time to get the tittle even putting seth in the mix which he had no business in it because they're story ended a while ago when seth got choked out in the .middle of the ring.
Definitely match of the night! The Rock is still rockin’!
Rocks title will be the new belt for Cody just minus the Bull . It’s a way of WWE to show off the new belt . Even if it’s not that belt Cody is getting a new belt the big gold belt but new style .
This’ll be interesting this setup…. I wonder if Jay and Seth will come help out to get Cody to win.
Boring
Ok, but more importantly….. what coat is Seth Rollins going to come out wearing on night 2?
Wow This is acting🎉🎉
Let's just appreciate the rock wrestling... maybe it was the last time
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
It is insane The Rock is still willing to put himself through all this punishment.
We want Sammy
If WWE wouldn’t put out new commercials of nite after mania on Raw and the new Belt it wouldn’t spoil the match that Cody is going to win. It’s no secret Cody is winning Sunday nite. The rock will cost Roman the title lol
I hated the lighting during matches, it looked depressing and the arena feels empty af
Imagine if steve austin shows up and helps out cody
What did you all expect he the final boss😂
I think is safe to say we all knew Roman & Rock was winning tonight to make night 2 more crazy
3:57 what is seth wearing
Cody will never get to finish his story
OMG I'm crying
The excitment on seth when the rock got into the rig, "am part of leandary"
The crowd were terrible, wasted on this audience, bring it to England and we’ll show you how it’s done
THE PEOPLES ELBOW
The way its looking , Cody might need Stone Cold to show up and stomp some mud holes in the Bloodline
Corwd want lights 💀 Crowd get shadow 🤡 Crowd want clean ring 💀 Crowd get ring with lot ads edit 🤡 Wwe want reaction from crowd 🗿 Wwe got no reaction from crowd 🤡
Roman reigns retains
Theres no way in hell chody gna win
I wonder if the Rock is going to keep the people's champ belt or will they let someone else compete for the title
They put on a show show
The final boss delivered what he and roman reigns promised which was smashing Cody and seth . Great match
The Rock can still go. As a 90s kid I'd love to see the peoples champ have 1 more run at the title
Good bye wwe and hallo aew
Rock Mania nite memory will come tomrw when he costs Roman the title, then the fued between Roman vs Rock for head of table will happen
😢Where can I watch the full match 😢
Why did the Rock feel the need to come out with his own tittle
This was one of the dumbest matches I've ever seen in WWE or WWF The Rock sucks and is dumb as also Roman reigns is stupid and dumb I can't win a damn thing in their life without cheating
Plot twist. The Rock wins the belt. He made the ref change the rules or he was fired. (Bloodline rules)
Disgusting match ever
From the looks of things after last night, if the referee counted, he is fired if they lose your all fired so who runs the damn show over there bloodline or Hunter
What if The Rock hadn't pulled the referee when he was pinning Roman 🤔🤔hmmmm.
I’m sorry but anyone doing the pedigree looks weird doing it. That move belongs to Triple H.
Grew up watching "WWF" with Bret Hart, Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, etc....this is embarrassing to call this wrestling
Cody is going to lose again tonight
That's nonsense 😒😒😒😒😒😒
This match is like one side easily beaten up  no competition
Fake Fake Fake I don't sew WWE Video After to day Because its fake not real Roman,Rock Also not Real man But Cody&Seth is 👑 but Fake
So. Bloodline Rules, right? That means... NO DQ. Supposedly SCSA and Cena are showing up. Let's also consider the L The Rock made instead of the 1. Here's another thought. Roman "accidentally" speared The Rock. Who says The Rock isn't gonna give Roman Rock Bottom on night two, maybe in retaliation? Maybe The Rock acknowledged Roman just to make him 'believe' that everything was good. Also, Cody brought out The Rock first. HMMMMM....
The referee literally counted three before the rock pulled him out
i thought the video played at .75x speed when the rock did the people's elbox...
Oh Cody for sure gonna win tomorrow 😅
Man Rock, Roman Reigns, Seth and Cody absolutely tore the house down! What a main event!! Excited for Night 2 tomorrow 🔥🔥🔥
Rock can sell anything 😂😂😂 sold the spear like a  boss
The Rock doing the throat slit before the people's elbow was so good
Welp that’s y’all answer y’all might as well get ready to see Roman win part to cuz I’m telling the bloodline is gonna have so much fun with Cody on part two I’m not even shocked we all knew what it was when the rock smack Cody at the press conference back then all that trouble they making Cody go thou by winning the royal rumble just to get to the biggest stage just to lose and then you got Seth he not gone make it out of WM still champ cuz guess what Damian about to cash in and judgement day finna take over raw and the new story line gone probably be bloodline vs judgement day I hate to say it I want Cody to win but tbh that man gone lose we all know what it is roman is in god mode ain’t no one stopping dat man he got nun else to prove ppl out here just gassing Cody up for him to get the tittle but hole time night 2 of WM he about to lose for the second time the only way I see Cody winning against roman is two reasons one the rock turn on roman and cost him the belt and it be a big plot twist or two someone gone help Cody anyway even if the stipulations was bloodline rules they still gone interfere and help Cody but tbh if roman lose key word IF roman lose it’s gone be Because of the rock💯💯💯
😔💔PERO que rayos le paso a roman xq tiene el estomago asi y todo ese maquillaje y el físico que se tenia??😢😭💔creo que mañana se viene el retiro de😔roman tantas luchas tantas diversiones 😔💔tantas locuras,  tantos momentos lindos con el linaje, y con the shield da tristeza saber eso😢😔pero todo inicio tiene su final grande roman reings fuiste para muchas personas el mejor que aunque cambiaran tu personaje a malo😢 alguna vez fuiste lo contrario 😔
Im sorry but the crowd pissing me off for some reason
Is Roman sick again? He seems to be a quite thin.
Not a good match tbh hopefully tomorrow makes up for it
Fake All WWE
Cheating as  always I didn’t  have to watch I know the answer I hate the the rock and rowen I never like them they stink
Cody got the 3 counts before Rock threw him out
And tomorrow, The Rock will betray Roman Reigns... For that spears...
After 25 years ....Getting to see the old vintage Heel antics by Rock is pure goosebumps!! Only if the glass shatters and Stone Cold comes out then....🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
WWE fumbled the bag with this one Cody and Seth should’ve won not the rock or Roman
🇪🇬🤬🤔😏🤏🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Wrestlemania extra large
I wish I got to see it live
Good Night, babe. Good Night, babe. I love you glad you're on that Mat. Have a good time watching it too. Babe, get blow me. That kissed her baby. Love you, Roman Anchorage, baby. I really didn't enjoy it. Thanks for sending me the night. Thanks a lot, baby. I love you, honey. Holot, babe, you're sweet.😊😊😊😊😊😊😊🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Prime bottle in the middle of the ring is a disgrace
Sad how Cody and Seth had to basically carry this entire match. Rock could do nothing but basic brawling stuff. Roman was just typical spear/superman punch. The only moments that actually got me hyped other than the accidental spear was the teamwork stuff Cody and Seth did.
God philly you suck so hard 😂 pathetic
Would’ve been nice to see the crowd whole place was blacked out lol could peoples there even see it look dark as
Hey tomorrow is gonna be bloody Seth will betray cody
Al the big build up and it failed bit like having great foreplay with the wife only to last 30 seconds in bed with her aew do pppvs far better hands down
Rock 😂😂he delivered can't lie
Usos disappointed me
Okay, now we all know Rock's gonna turn on Roman Reigns and Cody's gonna win tomorrow. 🥴🥴
This was a good match and rock can still wrestle pretty well.
MAMA RHODES
I couldn’t watch the first night but this 10:57 just pulled me back to attitude era. Rock still got it and for real: all 4 delivered so hard it’s awesome to see such chemistry in the ring.
Dude I swear I know it’s fake but the rock cheated
Kinda predictable but how people let themselves lose to an elbow drop is funny to me lol
Yeahh Final Boss Tribal chief ☝️☝️☝️
they shoulda did it where it all began madison square garden
The best match this year😂rock is one of the best wrestler of all time hell of a performer he still the show 😂😂😂
You  must  know that  you  can't go against your boss 😅😅😅😅
8:13 rock bottom & spear through the barricade
This match was terrible 💀
Worst wrestlemania ever
Cody cry baby
Rock & Roman are the dirtiest punks I’ve ever seen . They’re definitely not winning. They’re the worst vile cheaters. This match is absolutely unfair to Cody and Seth. Why in the hell WWE let the diarrhea rock get away with cheating and unfair ways in this match. What’s the hell wrong with tripple H - are you blind or coward to the diarrhea, cheaters- big losers scumbags rock and Roman 👎👎🤪. A wrestler who is honorable, popular and powerful should be the reference for the rematch again because this match is totally unfair and disrespectful to Cody & Seth and the audiences who paid to see a fair fight to the finish between the wrestlers. This match is a loss one totally &  absolutely unsportsmanship and it’s just like a farce play out to be sooo ridiculous and unacceptable!!
After watching many many matches of Cody Rhodes seeing him in the shadows of his father the Dream Dusty Rhodes then his brother Dustin Rhodes then realize some 20 years later that Cody turned out to be the best wrestler in the entire family is truly special. Cody Rhodes might not be the biggest and strongest wrestler in the ring,but he’s the most technical wrestler in that ring and can do it all. I’ve watched footage from backstage during Monday night Raws and Payperview matches and every single wrestler on this WWE roster respects the hell out of Cody Rhodes! All the greats in the WWE business have a ton of respect for Cody Rhodes and he’s earned his shot to be one of the greatest wrestlers to ever lace up the boots! It wouldn’t shock me one bit if Cody Rhodes is the one who knocks off Roman Reigns tomorrow night for the WWE Universal Championship! The entire WWE world would be proud of Cody.
I hate wwe always the same story
The crowd is very boring 😂😂😂 they made the show look average
Drew somewhere in the crowd eating Popcorn watching this.😂
What is up with this crowd?? I get it might be a bit chilly, but get some energy going, youll soon warm up!
The Rock selling that spear like he used to for Goldberg 😂
Bloodline winning is literally a spoiler that Cody is gonna win tomorrow. We all know how WWE’s storyline works lets be honest 😅
Just love this new nick name for The Rock, The Final Boss.
This looks like this was a hell of a fight.
WWE started out on a bad note, long live the UFC, so it's true
Drew is watching this like yeah now My plan is coming into motion.😈
Crowd was terrible
The Rock SOLD the hell out of that spear.
This match is useless, it didn't prove anything
This is the Rock I love.  Not Dwayne Johnson dropping garbage movies year after year.
Give mania to the UK, below mid crowd for this mania especially with the hype around this years.
Cody will still win Sunday neight
Screw Roman reigns and the rock can’t win a fair match always gotta interfere
I mean don't care about WWE but this was okay XL wasn't better than cm punk and the undertaker or anything before that i was waiting rock return  on Ramon tbh  tho
the build up 100%  the match 30% 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  a boring wrestler vs a boring wrestler 😂😂😂😂
Maybe we're at ThunderDome, we don't know 🤷‍♂️
How cody going finish his story if he lose to the rock
How about if the beast come out and break down all the bloodline tomorrow?
Looked electric! Thought the crowd was lit tbf
Uso’s match was absolutely abysmal. They traded kick for the entire max.
This is to all those Cody Cry babies
If Cody loses on night 2 everyone should riot
Crowd was dead for most of the show
Why does the Rock have a title? Lol
The Rock is turning on Roman tomorrow.
I still can't believe they keep doing that broken barricade prop... Every freakin' PayPerView someone has to go through the barricade to the same exact spot every time. Overkill.
Before the match started all the world know. No in the hell way cody n seth will win this match !  Poor cody n seth. 🤣
Aew has much better matches, just check out Will Osprey vs Hobbs.
Drama juara roman reign yang membosankan.. Reign juara dengan konsep cerita yang buruk.. tanpa pertandingan pun kita sudah tau alur cerita nya.. Hanya roman reign pegulat di WWE, pegulat yg lain hanyalah badut..
Who does everyone think priest will try to cash in on tomorrow? Tag titles gone from judgement day now...
Seen people writing about the crowd in the comment section. From this clip, the crowd sounded fine?
Class is permanent!
The Prime Ruiend the rock's entrance
The Final Boss trumps the Tribal Chief, one does not simply watch a rock entrance at low volume
Guacala que feo final
The crowd is mid= it’s aight
I sorry i hate Roman  and rock😢
If you count i will fire you😅😅 the king is fire 🔥
That stomp by rollins when roman was locked in looked deadly
The rock delivered
Betrayal is in the future.
Yeah, never have Wrestlemania in that trash town again. They witnessed a great match & the 11 year layoff return of The Rock and they give that kind of reaction? Philly doesn’t deserve another Wrestlemania.
Rock chose to be the vallian here.😁😐
WWE SHOULD CONSIDER VETTING PEOPLE WHO BUY TICKETS TO BIG SHOWS LIKE THIS The fans reacted so wackly The final boss should be received with either a huge pop or a huge  boo
We are in the Endgame, sport fans.
Great match,terrible crowd
Why does anyone think Michael Cole is a good commentator? Even his delivery of "The Final......Boss!" was badly done. Cringe.
This match should’ve had a guest referee hall of famer come out after the rock threatened to fire the referee. Bring someone out that he can’t fire.
The rock and Roman did so many cheatings😂
Reigns will be finishd by cody and that will be the end of story.rock will sellout
The rocks entrance was so long. YouTube gave an ad before he even walked out.
Cody can win if he din insist on his signature move dropped two times why he wanted third😣because of greed makes him lose
Momma Rhoades deserved it
Smartphone crowd. Shame on you
When the Rock entered with his own belt, you knew he was winning.
cody should've won this match
Intro was tight.
Roman trận & the rock là con sâu làm sầu nồi canh
They should have WrestleMania in Cleveland Ohio.
Too many ads for this to be WWE thumbs down
I’m surprised no one is talking about how great Seth complemented Cody
the most disgusting match ever in history Wrestlemania
Prediction for Sunday. The Rock turns on Reigns and helps Rhodes win.
The Match should have ended with those dual pedigrees, But whatever.
If you count, your f****** fired
Where was Seth Rollins 😢
Wow didn’t know that this was filmed during Covid
That Prime logo is a real eye sore
WOW ! That crowd is pathetic ! 🤫🤔
Bunch of rich people there. That's why the crowd is like it is.
The rock is gonna betray roman anyway
Dope match I think they could have shortened it to 30 minutes
Actual highlights, including the finish on Youtube?! This really is a new era. And I'm here for it.
The prime logo sucks in the ring
What a match WWE is the number 1 spot in the world 🔥🔥🔥
Roman looks like he was taking it in going up the ramp like it’s the end
Philly you failed at Wrestlemania. Pathetic crowd
Roman forever
🕵️.  .  .   It was The Rock, in the study with the lead pipe.
Rocky sold that spear just as good as the Stunner
So is cody not allowed outside help for bloodline rules? Surely if there are no rules, anyone can get involved right? If he can i reckons cody somehow (with help) steal a victory. But honits looking more like a beating sesh if he's on his own
The Rock and Roman Reigns cheated !!!Kudos to Cody and Seth !!!
Just sad that tommows mach with roman and cody is bloodline rules 😢😂😂😂😂
Naaaaaaa ....aburridasaaaa pelea....esperaba mucho más...muy lento....creo que hasta ricohchet hubiese hecho mejor combate que cody
The Rock looks nowhere near 50.
😂😂 The final boss😅... i wouldn't be happy to see seth and Rhodes defeating the Rock and Romans.. but I feel sorry for mama Rhodes and " all the cry babies" out there!😅 W.40 night 1 was good 👍
The rock 50 old years but is better then young people
YOU COUNT YOU'RE FIRED
Roman health not looking good.. god bless you tribal chief
Worse crowd in history of mania! The saudi crowd are even louder and more passionate thans this dead crowd
That really wasnt a great match. Maybe 2.5 outta 5
Dead  crowd
Anither trash wrestlemania
Why is ronnie2k in the crowd he should be fixing his game
Why chose Philadelphia when its cold
PHILLY - embarrassing crowd.  Most weekly Raw and Smackdown crowds are louder with 14,000 people.  This is the most quiet 72,000 fans I’ve ever heard.  The Rock is coming out and you guys act like it’s some jobber who deserves a light smattering of golf claps.  A tiny pop for one of the goats returning for Mania.  Embarrassing.  The rest of the show was even quieter.  You better bring it night 2.  That was a joke.
Philly sucks. Bring mania back to Chicago
One more thing I do understand that The Rock is the new member of the board of the WWE but what is doing is like the Authority way back 2013 to 2016 that they will do anything for power.
I’m just speechless of how amazing this match is. I’m depressed that Cody and Seth didn’t win, but it’s not over yet. What a match here on Saturday.
Rubbish! Where did Seth go after just a spear on the barricade? 😂 😂 It was all fixed.
10:23 i feel so bad for his mom 😭😭
Wow that sucks! Now Cody is screwed!
I don't know if I will watch the WrestleMania 40 because of the Bloodline it's like you will know already who is going to win and it's like 99.9% winning chance of Roman and 00.1% that Roman will lose. It's like they making Roman Reigns the big Goat and the real OG of the WWE that even much more that mixing The Rock with him is a very powerful, hopefully WWE will bring someone that can defeat Roman Reigns even for a non-title match, Roman is given too much power whatever you like or hate him he is abusing that power specially The Rock is spoiling Roman Reigns even more, but for me it's fine if Roman Reigns will be the champion for the next 5 to 10 years but we all know that only one man who can defeat him either a tag team, triple treat, fatal for way or single match, and that's Bray Wyatt
I think the Rock is going to clear out the Bloodline tonight paving the way for a Cody Rhodes win and Rock vs. Reigns next year. "Your father would be ashamed" and/or "I'm the real head of the table" kind of deal. That spear by Roman gives further motivation. Or the Rock made a promise to Dusty Rhodes to help his son or something. This has been a work within a work all the time.
The People's Elbow is the worst finisher in all Pro Wrestling
Ngl I’ve watched several great matches and this was easily the best Wrestlemanina I’ve seen in years. This crowd was simply mid, sorry to anybody from Philly but Wrestlemania should never be allowed to come here again.
Crowd deader thatn Bruce Waynes  parents
If the rock holds the belt after turning on roman reigns, it should turn in to the universal championship for Cody rhodes!!
The Rock is playing the Final Boss perfectly. He's AMAZING as a heel.
many more fool peoples thinks it's a real fight! 😂😂
Man the rock shoud've rock bottomed the ref. and triple H would come out as Ref! to make the match fair lol that would've been awesome!!
As expected
The match was not hyped.....
Interesting to see how the Rock still has it years later. Great match.
Cody already wonned  Watch happened?
Go rock and the  bloodline Tommow
The rock finally wrestling after 8 years absent
I mean nothings good in Philadelphia lets be honest
I was worried the rock would tear/pull/break something but he did effn brilliant, I was worried he would pull a Vince and tear both quads lmao but he held his own and some true legend
I don't understand how "finishing moves" never work just once in big events.  Even multiple times isn't good enough.  lol!
Samantha Irvin, most overrated ring announcer to date. Easy on the eyes, lousy on the ears. Only popular because she's attractive and most boys are simps
Cody really does get to do everybody’s moves 😅
The bloodline ☝🏿
The rock will help Cody wim
They should have had WrestleMania in Memphis!!!! We would have been live!!! Lol
was it just me or did it seem like this event was slower than normal. its like they only speed up towards the end of the matches.
He's beating everyone for that belt to become "The People's champion" thats our Final Boss belt☝🏿
Oh for f's sake. HAVE ROMAN LOSE ALREADY!!!
Where was Seth rollins
☝️☝️☝️☝️
Shocked of all places Philly was quiet
Wait where are roles
Trying make the Rock like the undertaker 🙄🙄🙄
Rock will cost Roman the championship,  revenge for that spear
And Seth pissed me off
Rock  told the ref he could do anything he wants
☝🏾☝🏾☝🏾
Year the rock win
A gdzie niby Rollins??  na końcu jeszcze był by świetny moment żeby dostał ktoś w plecy, jak ostatnio go upokorzył rom..
you count, you are fired. had me dead
Cody is going to bring the Rhodes Dynasty in night 2 to help fight off the bloodline.  Expect to see everyone that Cody knows interfere in the match to make sure the bloodline stays out of the ring.
>dead crowd  Grim
Roman didn’t like that
Idc what anyone says a rock bottom and the peoples elbow, it’s not efficient at all. There is no way in hell anyone actually gets a three count on that. I didn’t care who would win but to see those moves get the 1,2,3 it just blows my mind how anyone could think that hurts
The Rock's entrance was EPIC
I actually just want to see Cody beaten off of TV on night 2.
Yeah, I already know who’s going to win for next event✌🏾🤬
Did anyone not see this coming?
Poor Referee: One ..?? Final Boss : Listen to me.. You know the Rock ! You count … You fire !!!!! Poor Referee : Oh come on ! I just do my job .. Ok Ok oh right I got it ...
Hey how about r truth well deserved win for him
When he went for that peoples elbow, we all know we wanted the glass to break and the REAL final boss to turn up. WHAT!!?
The rock has to win against the guff of todays roster. A legend that overshadows the whole locker room put together.
Stupid, lamest match of the night. Rock cheated pulling the ref, Cody got the count and tonight was suppose to be fair
0 buzz 0 thrill lmfao wrestling is so hit hahahah
Awful crowd USA can’t beat UK fan never.
The Rock actually had an incredible performance tonight it was seriously impressive. He’s definitely meant to be back in that ring 🔥
who is chody😂
Oh my God this is incredible I enjoyed every beat of tonight fight
So Cody and Drew will win tomorrow
That people’s elbow was so smooth 😎 this match brought back my childhood because of Rock. Super insane how he held up after 10 or so years.
This was one of the best matches Ive seen in the last 5-7 years
Cody hesitated 😂😂😂
The rock is still tight good body condition
This is awesome ❤❤
"you count you're fired"
10:04 at least he did it right this time lol
I don’t know what was worse… the acting, the performance, or the script. Overall it was terrible. You could do better.
they had to cut out every botch Cody Cutter
They can't beat em, rock literally seats in the boar of wwe so 😂
Good match terrible ending
Mama rhodes
night 2 Bill Burr re-enacts his Philly Rant😂😂
Roman reigns was busted open
The UFC got me jacked up, I just can't believe in this cheesy type of entertainment haha sorry ppl
When Roman won me: again:(
Rock hit Roman in the head with the belt😂
The Rock is now "The Botch" he screwed up everything he did, and couldn't even do it well....smh he should go back to the screen...where they can edit his mistakes...that or he should get decent training before he gets back into the ring...so sorry to see the once "Great one" and "People's Champ" reduced to a sidekick. "The Brahma Bull" turned into "The Chief's cow"...oh I can go on....lmao
This is what i expected to happen. Reigns and The Rock won to set up the Bloodlines rule just to stack the deck against Cody just to make his win more impressive which would then free up the feud with Rock facing Roman Reigns which has never happened before. I hope my gut feeling is right about the storyline the writers are thinking of.
Cody did more fighting than Seth caz where is he😭 I feel bad for Cody
These guys brought their A game. No signs of ring rust from the great one.
After watching this I'm done watching wrestling and trust me it didn't even have to be cody Rhodes it could have been anyone I'm done because the whole bloodline is in every match no matter what it's ridiculous!!! So roman congrats on beating cancer I'm proud of you for that but I'm not proud of six on one that's wussy ish
The peoples elbow never gets old
I’m not sure but this all looks scripted to me.
Philly dont like trash old gandpa Rock😂😂😂
Epic
What is Seth wearing yet again you r a man not women
We need The franchise john
The Rock is a mountain of a man.... definitely the final boss
The crowd reacted how they felt.  Kinda predictable again.
"Crowd was dead." - people who weren't there
The rock, despite being the oldest out of these 4 wrestlers is the most jacked
So Final Boss please tell me, when are you planning on defending that title, fun  fact:in this match it's only The Rock who doesn't have hair,and it's only Cody Rhodes who doesn't have a title ❤😂
Brock lasnir please com back 😢
For what Rock did i wont watch his movies 😢
That Double Pedigree was wholesome  Triple H and his chosen two’s.
You're at WrestleMania, get off your phones. They were literally better off just watching it from home
Really ? thats how Cody lost ? pathetic😮
Wrestling truly is at an all time low, 2 of the 4 guys in here using a stolen finisher and gimmick from better stars of the past
I’m guessing Philly was so quiet because they’re still mourning their loss to the chiefs last year.
People saying the crowd was mid has to keep in mind that it was 40 degrees out there
People in the comments section talking about how the crowd was dead..... It's below 50° at night Even the commentary head Coats on along with the crowd.
Cinematic ! Amazing !
terrible crowd. needs to be in the UK for the best crowd
I swear if Roman win I'll never watch wwe again we're sick of Roman 😠
This is a disgrace
I remember When Micky Foley Lost Match to the Rock. Vince Just yold the Ref to go and ring The Bell😂😂😂😂. It reminds of that
This match deserved a British crowd
Finally The Final Boss has arrived to Philadelphia
Cody and Seth had a epic of a fight with Rock and Roman but Rock and Roman won
Roman Reigns, Cody and Seth did the whole job! The Rock should be grateful
What a disgrace
Why did they Remove lights from the crows??poor reaction from the crowd. They should be ashamed of themselves
Should have a wrestlemania in Australia or the UK the loudest crowd's in the world
The rock actually looked good and I loved it .
Oh no....Then this means that tomorrow it's the Bloodline's rules in the march between Cody Rhodes and Roman Reigns for the undisputed WWE Universal Championship!
Man this Philly crowd SUCKED
This match is so stupid and cringe
I dont know what everybody is talking about ? but  if you was at the stadium, that crowd was live the entire time chanting and standing out their seats, blame WWE  not the fans, they must have censor the noise, this is bs they probably will censor this comment as well,  I was there chanting my lung out through the whole show and I will do it again on sunday night, hopefully they dont censor the noise this time and plus I was at lower level so this cant be possible
great match
Congrats to The Rock and The Tribal Chief for Job well done 💪
6:50-6:57 OHHHHHHH S**T
WWE in planning to roman reign to lose the wwe championship tomorrow. I will bet all of my money on that. That is the plan for the beginning.
All hail ya my tribal chief ☝️☝️☝️☝️
My prediction is that becourse of Romans Spear towards the Rock, Rock will betray roman tomorrow and help Cody win
Night 1 was Infinity War and Night 2 is gonna be endgame
Never do Wrestlemania in Philly or any cold weather cities lol keep it in Hollywood or Vegas with bigger stadiums.
The crowd reaction is suck!! 😅
The final boss is cooking beans 😂😅.
Is wrestlemania 40 done witch the rock &roman reigns
Cody's pedigree was the worst bit of acting ever
Boy Corporate Rock in full effect...but in his own words "The Final Boss!!" (ROck Voice) 😂😂😂😂😂
I am really afraid Cody wont finish his story
Night one was good that ripley match was incredible start to finish then the bloodline vs Cody and Seth was pretty much a perfect match 💧
This was the match of the night and the rock was incredible in the age of 50  and it has been 8 years since he wrestled and his reaction to roman spearing rock was soo funny.
mama rhodes and Lana rhoades are watching and they sad😭
The whole bloodline is going to be there even aunties to screw Cody and am here for it
Cry Cody Crybabies 😂
Mi jefe tribal🎉
Seth will lose tomorrow...
smackdown entraces were much better. this dissapointed a bit
This crowd didn't make this feel like WrestleMania
If you count, you’re fired”. LMAO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Philly should never host another Mania. You can’t be this dead with such a great night. Philly sucks
Yo what if the rock came out dressed as Shao Khan i would've lost it.
Philly dont deserve a wrestlemania again.... imagine a Wrestlemania In my Island Puerto Rico, just watch us go in Smackdown and Wrestlemania Backlash last year whe are one of the most loudest and conected crowds you will ever expierience
more predictable than the sun rising in the morning
سەرکەوتوو بن ❤
Cena and astin returning night 2 to help Cody
Seth saved Cody from the spear too soon. Like a couple seconds too soon. It looked like it was on purpose cus Seth saved Cody too soon.
Stone cold is coming tomorrow night
Based on this ending at WM N1, Cody will win... Same result as Sami Zayn beat Gunther
wwe you are so fire in WrestleMania's i love the entrance of the rock❤
WHY DID THE ROCK FORGET TO TAKE THE ELBOW PAD OFF AND THROW IT TO THE CROUD?!?!? THATS THE BEST BIT!!! 😂
Rock you fire and don't come back to WWE no more
Full match upload ❤ please
Mandem Rock is really the boss of TKO 😂😂
Dumbest match ever
It is obvious that they are not putting the belt on Cody. Roman Reigns has never singlehandedly defended this title...he has always cheated his way up.
i counted 1 suplex and about 1 spinbuster  most was punches and kicking and throwing. i mean where the wrestling?
Cena and Austine are interfering in tomorrow's match to help Cody. I guarantee it 😂
Rock slapped Cody with the belt as he was going for the third Crossroad 😅😂😂😂  This one for you Mama Rhodes☝🏽
One of the worst crowd Philly you suck.
This is the end for Roman Reigns now?
I'm not watching WWE anymore and never again
That match was mid ngl
They had to win tonite , it was a given
Cody did his best. Rock can't fight cody rhodes alone. Thanks, cody.
My Tribal Chief ☝️💪 and The Final Boss The Rock ☝️💪 Acknowledge them ☝️☝️☝️
Wrestlemania was trash!
Philly has insane concert crowds, insane sporting fans. It’s an open air stadium, crowd noise gets lost
Is me or was there something going on what Rock said to Roman before pinning Cody!!! 😳😳😳
If you thought it was going to turn out any other way, then you haven’t been paying attention for the last 10 years. The rock has a no loss clause in his contracts. I’m glad we can find highlights on YouTube because this ain’t worth my time watching it live.
Roman và rock vua bọ cạp chơi bẩn
The rock entrance who's electrifying
since rock got speared by roman, the rock will return the favor tomorrow and screw roman !!!
Should have done Mania in London, im just saying
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Cheated!!!
Who will play against who tonight please answer me?!
무슨 결과가 이따구야
I hope tonight is not gonna be like yesterday
This crowd was pitiful
we’re lacking dean ambrose
REALLY NEGGEH⁉️ PEOPLES ELBOW⁉️
Told ya Roman would spear The Rock, told ya Rock and Roman would win. Perfectly sets up Cody to win the title
The rock will turn on Roman on night two because of that spear🙆‍♂️
This truly was a mid match predictable and honestly didn't do much aside from make Cody and seth look bad. a horrible WrestleMania the crowd was trashy as hell Paul if you read this I know what you have and are capable in that brain of yours bring that fire come tomorrow man, this iss supposed to be the biggest WrestleMania of all make it just that!
Bloodline rules 🎉🎉
Welp let’s hear all of your bad booking ideas now Cody Crybabies 😂
Cody no story
Bloodline had some prime on the outside of the ring to help them withstand Powerbombs, spears, and crossroads.
La luchas es una mierda no la veo más 🤮
Love how Pat mentions the Spanish Announcer's table lol
Tama Tonga will debut to gun stun reigns down to rock bottom for Rhodes victory.
6:55 that's a strike 3 for you roman! The Rock definitely found another reason to betray his cousin, 1st forcing Rock to acknowledge him, 2nd is interfering Rock's catchphrase "If you smell what the rock is cooking" & now spearing him. Good luck tomorrow roman, better keep an eye on The Rock 😏  Just as what I've expected, Roman will definitely spear The Rock by accident during their tag match against Cody & Seth.
Yeah Philly Didn’t Deserve THIS WrestleMania
Cody please don't fail on Sunday 🙏🙏😭😭😭 u will break our hearts
Who saw rocks mom at 7:03
That intro was AWESOME!
Why am i not surprised they made him win
Was a solid match. Wish the crowd was more into it
wow, sold out for a completely dead crowd
I enjoyed it
That crowd sucks
Bruh the ref had to use both hands when cody and seth pinned the rock and roman 😂 I'm so dead 7:12
No way this was a dead crowd for the rocks return
Can't wait to see Cody win today
Now watch Triple H come out there in Night 2 and give The Rock a pedigree
It's Bloodline's rule on the second night. Cody Rhodes is destined to lose to Roman Reigns two times in a row on WrestleMania. Now Seth Rollins has to worry about his knee on his Championship Match on the second night. Please don't lose it to Drew McIntyre before he turns into a humble character.
For wrestling a key doing the same thing same thing right now just make me want to say hey goodbye to WWE 10 miles was just say get rid of all of wrestlers and just only need Roman reigns because they keep stripping into Roman reigns Roman reigns might be the face of the company but he's not a real champion fighter one man army of the company he is a bloodline champion all he can do is using his family to fight his battles and pick up the scraps like telling them sick and dogs and have the dogs tear up everything and he picks up the scraps like he have his brothers to beat up everything and he picks up the scraps now he has another one inside a new full that's the rock to to Dominican people so he could pick up the scraps the same way he did his brothers the same way he's using the rock to do the same way if you look at all the videos how he was doing his brothers I mean excuse me sorry his cousins and it's the same way he's doing it to the Rock let the rock shredder and put them down on the canvas and that's when Roman reigns pick up the scraps and finish them off
Rock's still got it
I'm sorry but the crowd ruined the match.  (It was a good match but the crowd was dead most of it and that pissed me of).
I don’t blame The Rock for threaten to referee official Chad Patton I mean I love The Rock when he is a good guy and bad guy it’s because he’s The Final Boss.
Soooooooooo many ads 🤣
From the sounds of it, the crowd was meh at best? Imma just saying, msybe stop taking lameos to wrestlemania. 😂 Next time take ppl who actually enjoy it. 😆 🤣
What a dead crowd 🤦‍♂️...
Yawn.
Terrible match, sick of the bloodline nonsense and bad wrestling
Thank you for putting those 2 midcarders in there place
To bad, hopefully Cody will still make it somehow!
You'll never beat a 90s crowd. These kids of today are too spoiled. They expect the wrestlers to make noise for them
"Cody is screwed" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro cody and seth almost won
Dry-hair Roman Reigns looks like a „Wild Samoan“! ☝️😮
Dead crowd.
I felt like Seth is a brother everyone should have when he saved Cody from that spear that hit Rock😅
This means Roman will lose tomorrow.
Wtf did anyone even waste their time watching this match everyone already knew who was going to win just like everyone knows Roman is going to win tomorrow too because HHH is an a** kisser nowadays
Garbage
The first good looking spear Romans ever done
I think the outdoor venue hurts the show. The closed in arenas are better for the acoustics of the event. If nothing else, the crowds typically sound way better, imo. Might be something I consider for these bigger ppvs
Rock’s face🤣🤣🤣
Why is that guy in the green always there??
¡Que porqueriaaaa! ¡Que porqueriaaaa!
When Roman lose his title, WWE Will bem boring
Pretty obvious they were saving the talent for tomorrow, but this was a terrible match. Very happy we didn't have to watch a rock solo match though.
Because Roman didn't help Jimmy win I thing the twins link up to stop the Rock and Roman tonight to end Romans Reign
That's it. End of the road for cody. Tomorrow is Bloodline rules
What a show !!! So fake , I love to see Brock and gold berg
This outcome actually made day 2's main event more interesting.
8:21 seth rollins got barracade nostalgia from roman reigns 😂
This is so gay
Im glad that the fact goldberg better than the rock
love this so much
Philadelphia fans are so dry because the audience were not really reacting to the performance of the wrestlers😢😮 I'm I the only one who knows this please comment if you know better😮😮😮
WWE be like   Here watch these adverts 🤣
You count your fired 🤣😂🤣
Of course The Rock HAS to have a belt.  Of course this video HAD to feature only The Rocks entrance lol
Seth is just different definitely carried Cody for what it was worth…
6:58 The Rock's face
Pretty sure what’s gonna happen tomorrow . The rock Wil betray the bloodline and Cody will be champion . That’s the only thing that makes sense .
The rock's face in the thumbnail when cody hits Rock bottom the rock 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bloodline Story is to Long and IS getting boring.
I know the match sucked, but if you watch at 5X whenever the Rock is in the ring, it looks like him when he could move 15 years ago.
Roman spearing Rock was def highlight of the match. That double pedigree a close second... lets face it. Rock v Roman is really the big one idc give Cody the title
this is the most boring crowd I've ever seen, and the first time ive seen the rock entrance without the yell of the crowds
Of course roman  and the rock won....how predictable and boring....no doubt he wont lose  his title either
I saw the winning i knew the rock will go for it so cody can fully prepare for night two, still cody and seth gave their best
Cody gave away that Roman was gonna spear him. His acting is not that great
Winning tomorrow is going to make everything right
Not gonna lie the rocks entrance was dramatic😩😭🤞
Never Saw a boring crowd like this...  I was like What? Do they really watch WWE?
Rock with this “Thanos” as entrance
I'm surprised that the 51-year-old rock moves and sees so well
I’ve never seen quite a intro like this You can tell this is a revival of greater things to come.  Sure it’s a bizarre play of words elegance theatre fitness duration and The Rock.
This crowd booed Cody so loud in this match. They even booed Seth when he was trying to get them to sing his song during the match. I’m interested to see what the crowd is like tomorrow. They actually sucked tonight. As for The Rock, I’m SO PROUD OF HIM! He did AMAZING!
Never bought into Cody, mid card guy at best. Got booed out of AEW and now he’s a top guy in WWE, they need to do better.
maraming bumoto ke Robin dahil sa gusto nyang isulong ang death penalty, pag support sa 9improvement ng local farming and isa sya sa me gusto ng federalism. Akala nila gusto talaga magsilbi un pla default polititian lang.
Hey don't forget Damien priest he might cash in
Philly sucks plain and simple
rock deal with the match not the crowd
R-Truth, the Rock, Rey Mysterio, Damian Priest and the Miz are the only 5 guys at night 1 who are older than WrestleMania itself 😱  ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ☝️
Rock just looking like he never left
على طول في خيانة غيير هالوضع يا HHH كرهنا هالتمثيلية . كنت من 1979 متابع وكسرنا الدف والله يوفقكم بهالرياضة يلي بهدلتها إدارتها 😮😮😮
Now you know Cody is winning at night two of Wrestlemania 40
The final boss with his best build body...
I'm so bored of roman reigns never liked him at all
I thought Philadelphia was a wrestling city
That’s the rock belt I wanted 👀
Bloodline full of corruption
Horrible show. Horrible crowd. Get rid of Dwayne Johnson! He’s trash just like Biden. Crown a new champ or count your loss WWE.
Phile crowds are tough..... it's as if it's not cool to enjoy  yourself or the match without someone looking at them side ways
So we're not to ACKNOWLEDGE that the Final Boss Rock entrance is dope af😊
Well... I'm glad The Rock and Roman beat those crazy looking referee's 😂. Who knows what's gonna happen if those two wanna be champ champ. One's gotta story and the other wears his wife's clothes 😅
Worst main event in a long time. Too long and not much in ring action. Why have a Bloodline rules match on night 2 when they just had one tonight?
This match delivered I loved it!
草泥马WWE垃圾剧情🤢🤢🤮🤮罗曼拿了这么久的冠军腰带还不换人拿？？？你的垃圾摔跤越来越没人看吐血恶心🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
What a Fake azzzhit
Horrible
This match is not fair especially on side of Cody and Seth
glad I did'nt go but I hope they have a good time
I guess it was a waste of wrestelmania tickets where's jey uso deal with the rock they would won the match already
Worst crowd ever
@astargmoneynevaendz999
What belt does the rock have
Cody gonna lose against roman as bloodline rules stand
The rocks entrance always upgrades and gives goosebumps ❤
let's be honest, cody's not gonna win tom, it's gonna be another slaughter from the tribal chief :)
WrestleMania needed to be taken to London, Last years MITB the crowd was screaming like crazy singing everyone's song
W match. L crowd.
There was nothing on the line
It would be so dope If Stone cold crashes the Party and the Rock tomorrow.
مباراة ممتازة ❤
Rocky got some Goldberg Flashbacks lol 🤣
Coby😢 importa corazón ❤
Dead F Crowd.
This was actually the worst match ever , with those rules from The Rock .. You cannot let those people who actually deserve a chance ..
don’t get the bipolar indecisive clowns in the crowd who chose to cheer Cody but when it came down to it changed side get off the rag and pick a side they be there own enemies at time this why we can’t have nothing nice a bunch of goofies with a vocal cord the match was good though
Mama Rhodes was on fire
The city of Philly should be cancelled from future Wrestlemanias.
Listen. The crowd was dead because the rock and reigns didn't win clean. They wanted cody like we all do
You see the difference between rock and reigns during that double pedigree. Where the rocks sells it so well and manages to turn at the same time for the count but seth has to turn reigns and the ref doesn't count in sync cause of that
Cody left AEW to job to a running stalled elbow. Good stuff Codes.
Cody wins title on night 2 and holds it for about a minute before Rollins comes out and pretends to act happy that Cody is the new champion but when they go to hug, Seth with turn on Cody and beat a tired and defenseless cody down and damien priest comes out and cashes in and is new champion. Story is finished. Cody finallly beats Roman but leaves mania without a championship once again!
"the biggest wresltemania of all time" they said.... more like the quietest wrestlemania of all time
Lmfao look at 2 Chainz front row 😂
What it new title belt the hold on his shoulder
The rock was not playing at all
Come night 2, Cody will win!
Roman and The Rock 👍👍👍
6:55 Rock is having flash backs from 2003  Also, this might be a betrayal for the rock
What a loser
The rock is cheater
Why would you buy tickets to the most epic show and not be that excited. This, to me, is not a wrestle mania crowd. Do better tomorrow and in RAW!
The Bloodline 😘😘😍😍😍The Rock 😍😍😘😘☝☝☝☝☝☝
Rock will betray reigns for sure
DAM! THAT WAS ELECTRIFYING❗️🔥🔥🔥
The Rock is not as explosive and agile as before. He’s been doing all power moves this match
the crowd ruined everything
👏👏👏
The belt is for extreme marks to buy. So shameless
Knew it Cody and Seth would lose
Worst Mania since the one with Savage vs Japan Heel Crush

10:21 I need my refund dammit
I'm waiting for the beast Brock lesnar 😊😊
There's a chance that roman will get screwed tomorrow bcz of that spear
I can't wait to have this event out of the US where crowds are actually good and give af about matches, stories and wrestling in general, I love my country but God we have so many events that crowds are dead or just go cause there bored and have nothing better to do
The Rock says know your role
☝️☝️☝️☝️
Legendary Main Event Tag Team Match Tonight!!⭐️⭐️💎💎🌎🌎🙏🙏❤️❤️🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
Philadelphia doesn't deserve Wrestlemania ever again.
People who saw the South Africa flag            Btw I’m from South Africa  👇🏾
Nice
An incredible match
Hoping Randy Orton, Cena and Jey helping out Cody to complete his story
Will be interesting to see what “Bloodline Rules” means seeing as there were basically no rules tonight.
9:52 whats this crowd.. these boys belonged to the John Cena era, sell them to older men who appreciates attitude era
Anyone saying this is a new golden era or new attitude era is a fool .   Apart from main event the card was pretty tame and the ladder match was awful . Please please get new replacements on commentary !
Mama Rhodes and The Rock have personal issues sure😂
CM Punk as guess ref tomorrow night? He did tease it tho if there will be a bias match. And this ones hella bias
They should host Wrestlemania in like the UK they have the best crowds. Like the one they did in Cardiff, crowd went wild all night
What has Mama Rhodes done to The Rock? 😂  It seems more about her than the body taking the beating.
This channel is the reason I use ad block.. 4 mins in and 3 adverts. Greedy mofos
At 5:17 you see @tomgrossicomedy on the right side ! ❤
Advertisements on the ring huh!
Paul Levesque the chef
Pô o Seth Rollins Ficou OFF A Luta Inteira
I am extremely so happy with The Rock sir and Roman Reigns boss' victory in this tag team match and surely today,"The Bloodline" will ensure Roman Reigns boss to retain the biggest ever title at the same stage,good friends!!!:-D
Acknowledge The Final boss
No one can defeat the people's elbow.
💩💩💩
cody sucks
Awesome main event. Good to see the Rock’s still got it. Really the only bad thing I have to say about him is his People’s Elbow ain’t the same as it used to be. And that intro too. As soon as I saw that, I knew it was over for Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins
So great they show highlights so soon! 👍
A half dead monkey is more lively than the crowd
Simple but awesome
Happy no 1 cares for philly 😂
Que porquería de lucha
Rock is definitely a better wrestler than he is an actor.
The next day, seth and cody will take back their titles.😮
Wow this is the SHOW, very good fight
Now lets see the spear from the rock to roman reigns at day 2👌 then finish the story cody.   Then wrestle mania 41 The tribal chief vs the high chief💯
Stardust stardust
That belt rock has is cool as hell the peoples championship altho he is heel so kins of a slap to the people and it kind of takes away from the main title romans defending tomorow . Thats my only small gripe i had with the main event . Amazing entrance for the rock especially he looks great and had a good match looked in great shape
By Bloodline rules WWE means that roman will retain how on earth is cody gonna handle Roman rock solo and jimmy ?
i have a gut feeling the rock is gonna betray roman
ما هذا العرض الخايس لا يستحق ذا روك الفوز
BOO
@ 5:10 it was definitely a 3 count
Rock gonna screw Roman "By Mistake" for that spear he took. Then we will have The Final Boss vs Acknowledge Me, head of the Table Match
What’s wrong with the crowd?
They need to get rid of the 2 day Wrestlemania event. It oversaturates the product. People already saw the main card performers for Sunday's main event on night 1. It is ridiculous.
stomp might be the crappiest move ive ever seen
The thumbnail 💀💀💀
Its well known that alot of the noise goes strsight up and out when you do a show outside as opposed to an inside show where the noise is amplified
I am glad it went down this way. I didn't want Cody to get Daniel Bryan's " Superman Treatment ".
So its true, Roman isn't well... He's much thinner now... Maybe due to his Cancer
Entrances and the ring announcement lasted 25min. Then another couple minutes after the bell rang before anyone touched. I get that it's WM and they're doing 4 entrances of top guys, but damn, nearly a half hour to get them in the ring and start the match? It was pretty absurd considering none of the entrances were that elaborate.
THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE MATCH BUT ROMAN REIGNS VS CODY RHODES
SOMEONE CALL MAMA RHODES
I was hoping Cody win this time
lol Cody will rip Roman head off and become wwe champion
" you count, you fired! " - Final Boss's special ability
This match was super dope. Great wrestling,  awesome moves, plot twists... vintage greatness!!!!
Because it wasn’t that great lol we all knew the outcome.
1. Reigns speared Rocky.  2. The Rock Bottom took some time, that it seemed he whispered something to Cody to just lie down. Dude I hope Rocky is the one who turns on Reigns, not the other way around.  3. Seth was a non-factor after the spear on the barricade.
The rock is cheating
It's a shame that crowd sucked tonight.  Usually Philly is a great crowd.   They totally fell flat for the Sammy win.  What a let down for Sammy's big moment.
Sooooooooooo longgggggg & disappointing
The champions better keep their head on a swivel, tomorrow night. Priest is gonna be lurkin with that MITB.
the crowd is not mid, they simply didnt care about this match and this finish
i was impress with the rock able to take a bump, a spear, rock bottom through a table and did wrestling moves! I knew that was the ending the rock pin cody and did the exact ending of cody losing like last yr but a twist to it
man wwe sucks now compared to 10-20 yrs ago with batista and rey/taker and kane and the hardy boys/dx runnin it man...
it's a shame that the crowd was a bit meh, but damn! What a main event!
The final match was ok if it were a mid-card  The rest of the event sucked big time and crowd was a joke. The old 1990's WWF Superstars Sunday shows where the talent would defeat jobbers had more excitement from the crowd than this event tonight. This whole thing looked forced
Wrestlemania Puerto R$ico next year, we need a hyped crowd
Who's that with mama Rhoades...😮😮
I'm so angry that stupid the Bloodline won the match, I will not acknowledge them. I want Cody Rhodes to win.
6:56 The rock just got flashbacks from Goldberg
All the ads I've been seing for the past month have really been trying to get me into wrestling.  This match assured I will never give it another passing glance. This was the dumbest thing I've ever seen.
And of course give the rock his 15mins of fame like always he wins
Codys not winning tomorrow...gut feeling says its a trilogy
There is no way the Blondine sheat Anothet time to win i hate the bloodline😊
The rock face in the thumbnail looked like he fell off the highest  🎢
Am worried for roman reigns
Cody and seth why why why why  guyz
2chainz
Who couldn't see that coming a mile away?
People in Philly are abunch of Marks.
I know in the noise bleeds we were going off
Wow what a great match 😂
Cody Rhodes wins night 2 then challenges Rock for the Final Boss belt & wins. Rock retires, Cody is the final face.
Rocky... Rocky... Rocky... Rocky... Rocky... Rocky... Rocky... Rocky...
*That was an entertaining script*
I think Cody is going to win tomorrow!! A big surprise is on the way!! Maybe Rock betraying Roman
7:16 ref really use 2 hands.. props to him
Hey philly? YOU SUCK!! chicago was way better and that was just RAW
The Rock is not good. Very Unfair match. 😢.
una kk
Perfect match
Prime logo is horrendous
My prediction:  Rock and roman wins✅ Night 2: Seth VS Drew  -Bloodline interferes  -Drew wins. Cody vs Roman  -Rock betrays Roman  -Cody beats Roman  -Seth attacks Cody  -Damian Priest Cashes in Cody
This match is hopeless and has been sold. Indeed, The Rock and Roman Reigns will win before they start a failed match. There is no supervisor or judge. Basically, the owner of the company is asleep, and he is the one who caught the terror.  ￼
Only Tripz Boyz dose the pedigree
We know who will win tomorrow.
The Rock is the Final Bossiest Boss to ever Boss.
Cody win’s tomorrow with the help of Sami Zayn, Kevin Owen’s, and Jay Uso. Book it!
Me and my family will never watch wwe because of roman reigns  .
why is the “crossroads” the weakest finishing move ever 🥱
Who kicks out of the pedigree😅
the crowd was loud asf on my end its cuz i went idk what you guys are smoking
CM Punk and John Cena were right about this corporate Disney d-bag from the beginning!!!! "If you count, you're fired!" Spoken like a true MAGAt!!!! Spoken like a true Republican!!!!!
Is it me or is this years WrestleMania trash ?
Que publicó tan muerto son los gringos, con razón cuando viene a la arena México se impresionan en un simple viernes de lucha normal
There were many moments in this match that deserved a better reaction IMO. This crowd reminded me of Covid times. Hopefully Cody's moment tomorrow night won't be ruined by them (Yes I do think Cody will win). I really hope that someday when the next generation of fans discover the videos of WM40 and witness the end of one of the longest title reigns ever, they truly feel the energy
Look at rocks hand gesture towards the end. He had the L for the bloodline
Great match! Wrestling is Back!!!!
When Cody go back to Rock at final was so fake and lame, at the 3 Crossrhodes 🤣🤣🤣
Philly has the worst crowds😭
I was really hoping stone cold would’ve came
How boring and predictable
Dwayne Johnson dont NEVER quit with wrestling Keep do this
Night 1 was pretty good imo, only disappointment for me was the Uso's. Literally just traded super kicks for 20 minutes which was insanely boring to watch.
Yes now end Cody's story with. A loss at the next one
Bring back Brock Lesnar!!!!!
The result is clear cody rhodes wins on night 2 with the help of brock lesnar
But tomorrow it’s all over
We gotta need Bill Burr to trash talk Philly audience on WWE for real. They respond well to that
After all these years Rocky still sucks!
So the Rock made himself a title so he could look like a champ just for this match what a dumb tool👎👎🤣🤣🤣 is Rock & reigns going to fight for that title next year at mania when they face off?🤣
Hell of a job, 4 of them
華がない、プロレスも上手くないコーディをここまで推す理由はなんだい？
My prediction that the American Nightmare will win on night 2, with help from either...  1) "Texas Rattlesnake" Stone Cold Steve Austin 2) "American Badass" The Undertaker  3) "Real American" Hulk Hogan (who happened to be in the very first Wrestlemania)
The Rock carried this whole match. From start to finish.  Even at near 52, The Rock can still go.  Even scored the winning pin. As usual helping Roman to his 1,000th win.
don't come to philly for WM ever again.that was the worst crowd ever
I know who win tomorrow wwe sucks
Final Boss and The Tribal Chief teach Mama Rhodes and Cody crybabies a lesson they will never forget about ☝🏼☝🏼☝🏼🩸🩸🩸
The Rock showed up and showed out! From the the entrance to the match he was great bell to bell👏🏾👏🏾 The Final Boss is GOATED!☝🏾
So bored of the “two cross-rhodes then Cody wanders over to the ropes for no reason so someone can interfere then Reigns no sells and hits a spear spot”. It’s just dumb
This just means cody would win tommorow. They can't win the same night of the main event. Though i'm kinda skeptical on rollins retaining.
Just too many phones
Seth Rollins was taking a nap most the time
not gonna lie. I'm from Pittsburgh and being right next door to Philly. (rival cities because of football) the crowd here is clueless, they don't know what to cheer or boo lol. the crowd was all over the place and all the matches were A grade. even the main event. super fire 🔥🔥 they all did extremely well. and the rock was on his game
I hate Roman
If Roman wins tomorrow I’m done with wwe for good
Can hear they still use blow dryers for the audience cheers lol 😂😂
Calling it now rock will betray Roman tomorrow and Cody will win
el mejor duo the rock y roman reingns
The bull win😢
Why the hell Prime logo is in middle of ring?
Worst WrestleMania ever worst main event ever worst crowd eveeeer !
"If you count, you are fired" I wouldn't count also if I was ref 😂
Svaajt
IT'S BLOODLINE RULES  BABY 😂❤
You become very very stupid with your :"Ouuuuuuuuuuuuuh!Stop Roman,change your strategy!
Fake bs just like a soap opera
It's Detroit Big Time all over again ... Roman has made this a boring as Ed Farhat the original Sheik made Detroit in the 80s
Roman and the rock 🫵🖕👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
It was awesome match especially the part talking with MaMa Rhodes and the belt delivered was Sound all PHILADELPHIA😂THE ROCK⚡️ is Really the most Electrifying & Entertaining Man
Cody will have his glory today
RO! ROman Reigns. RO! ROck. RO! ROllins. RO RhOdes!!!😊
Undertaker is The Final Boss 🔥🔥
the crowd is so deadd. EC 2024 had better crowds iguess
This was Epic but man the people act like they was zombies or something.
Never go back to Philly.
Cody had his chance. It’s my turn to finish the story. 😤
That spear by Roman reigns to The Rock was brutal.
I feel sorry for Roman Reigns, great The Rock
Damn this is one of the firest match I ever watch
😂 The referee used both arms to do the pin on both Rock & Roman that was kinda funny
Belt win again Fxx 😢
shittiest mania crowd ive ever seen
Awesome 👌
The thumbnail of the rock getting his own finisher on him lmao
main event was solid, the rest of the card was a botch fest
As if half the video is the rocks entrance
Wasn’t worth the hype, Everyone knew the rock was going to win. He only pretty much shows up for these events cause the pay is right.  They weren’t going to let him lose. 😅
Kept waiting for Seth to sell Cody out (He's done it before). If Drew doesn't get Seth tonight, Damian will.
Rock is going to turn on reigns tomorrow its basically hollywood hogan heel vs face rock heel hogan lost became face
Philly didn’t deserve this match man
Why the crowd so quiet? Everyone on their phones or what? How stupid
Losers , just cuz your dad dies doesn’t mean you get the win. Also when you win tomorrow Damian gonna cash in money in the bank so there is your stupid story kid
How Seth cannot wake up from spear and the rock and Roman woke up from slam on the table and two Cody finisher fake wwe Seth is more than that. Seth and Cody winner for this match triple h is not a creative he should be retired
WTF DOES SETH HAVE OLD😂😂😂😂😂
This is the end of wwe .. bring personal is shame of samoan tribe
We need Stone Cold become Reff
They should tune in to the match i think thats why the crowd was dead silent
Damn that Philly crowd trash
y do come to wrestlemania & put your phone cameras 🎥 on all night without any chants from the fans y don’t you just watch from home wwe next wrestlemania won’t be bad in Africa
Cody and Rollins would of won if the rock didn’t pull the ref out
Lame 🤷🏽‍♂️
The Rock didn’t need to pin Cody. I was kind of expecting Roman to pin Seth since he never pinned him. It would’ve been better that way, I feel but no we got have the ego manic final boss victory I guess🙄 Either way I knew it would end up being Bloodline Rules. If Cody doesn’t win tomorrow than all of this build up is for nothing.  I wouldn’t blame him one bit if he turns heel.
Pls Stone Cold Return And you Cena! Its been a year since u guys returned
roman and the rock are loser rock shouldnt tell the referee he be fired
Swears I love the spear Roman Gave the Rock 😅, definitely the rock gonna spoil things for him in return
The story is finally over😂😂
Cena left wwe died
Roman can’t carry wwe his a fraud
😂😂😂😂
Roman gotta win tomorrow
The Rock looking like he’s in his 20’s is pure insanity.
Philly sucks!
Just put randy orton instead of cody
Tony Khan actually hired a troll farm to say Philly was dead at WM lol😂
Seth and Cody they already beat them, coward rock and Roman they cannot beat without cheating
DAMN rocky moves like he still back in the 2010s 🔥🔥🔥
i think the rock will betray roman bloodline rules match
Stone cold…. Prediction…. Used to say…. You can’t just go out there and raise an eyebrow and get over.
Where the hell the rock title belt came from ...
In all honesty, this was totally NOT Cody & Seth’s night here, man. But, at least they gave it their all trying! You gotta give mad props to them on that, man!
The crowd were like disappointed
The Cody Crybabies are really crying now.
Philly fans is hated on rock
Mama Rhodes “ 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂I swear to god I bust up every time the rock says that or “boy”😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥generational performer 😭😭🔥🔥
I wonder if Hulk Hogan will appear tomorrow and give his weight belt to Cody to whip The Rock with as revenge.
Never do a cold venue and the Philly crowd was underwhelming. They should never come back to Philly for a Wrestlemania ever again.
Today - Infinity War  Tomorrow - EndGame
Today, I ' m gonna thank the @WWE for that scenario, Stardust lost, OMG ❤😂.
Night 2 truly promises to be an ENDGAME. It could either be a START of a Reconaissance Era or the CLOSURE of a legendary Bloodline dynasty!
That makes Cody's story even more better & intriguing.
Well now they should know not to host a mania in Philadelphia again, because that crowd was very dead
I not gone lie now dat fire🔥 that's surrounded by The Rock that represents a brummah bull that's hell of dope 💪💯💯💯
American Home Shield Stole the show tbh
Was that winnie harlow? @ 8:00 😮 very good performance by cody & seth 😢
Tommorrow Roman will retain than Cody vs Rock which gives cody another chance to redeem himself and be the champ but not tommorrow
You know The Final Boss can't lose on his return back. 😅
صلوا على اشرف الخلق سيدنا محمد عليه افضل الصلاه والسلام 🤍🤍
Biggest tag team match ever?😅
Where was seth all this while
I'm honestly surprised The Rock didn't say GAME OVER 😂
what a match. imo rock still in his prime.
This crowd is solid......  meh.
Yeah cody will win now
The usos have proven they’re not stars!!! They’re just a family wannabe. These dudes are pathetic at wrestling and their acting is HORRIBLE! They always be walking around with these fake slug faces that’s dooo obvious
"you count...ue r fired😂😂😂💔"
😊 fire 💥💥💥💪
I knew  the rock wold win  and roman will win i had hope in the rock and roman reings
Bloodline rules means the rock can interfere tomorrow and betray roman 😂
Beside all of it, still can't believe I can witness people's elbow of a full match in 2024
طالما الظلم موجود لا تنتصر العدالة للأسف
I hope jey helps Cody tomorrow 😂
I see they gave The Rock a participation trophy.
The Rock unlocking his Heihachi Mishima level
L crowd NO YEET
Yeet
I guess they knew rock and reigns will win this
I'm sorry but this crowd for a wrestlemania ppv was absolutely dog poo. The matches weren't even bad, actually better than we expected but the crowd decided they weren't gonna vibe at all. Kills 50% of the hype.
This match was absolutely a 10/10 was very freud🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
☝️🩸
Bloodline rules always dominate 👆
I WAS THERE
Ok that's was ugly
I'm so mad bro tomorrow night I wanna see surprises and Cody needs to finish that story I believe in that!! ✊✊✊
Man the Philly crowd sucks
Ya estoy aburrido de lo mismo y aquí dejo de seguir a la WWE
The bloodline is awesome
If you count you're fired 😂😂😂😂
lame fight cody and seth shoulda won already knew it would be roman but damn 🤦🏻‍♂️ that was a boring ending
Seriously, why spend money on an event if you will be silent?
Plan or not I'm done watching these cheaters win
has Reigns considered turkey tail mushroom daily to cure his cancer? should work
Horrible stage, horrible crowd!
Who won please?
It seems MJF will showup tmoro 😭 pin this so will not be shocked!
This was good. The Rock’s update of his character is a winner.
Solid match.
that hayman guy so phat now like a whale
The crowds were bots Not human being
Rock and Cody's chemistry 🤌🏼 a 1 on 1 match a year ago I didn't know I needed. This was the perfect end to a good match, until tomorrow
The Rock and Paul Heyman working together is history
its so predictable lol..tomorrow at the end of cody vs roman match....rock will betray roman( will not get DQ ed because bloodline rules) ...then cody won...then cody and rock handshake, but NOPE..rock will rock bottom and people's elbow to cody...then damien priest come out and cash in...
Hell yeah! Bloodline Rules, here we come!
The Rock's People's Champ belt looks better than the Universal Title lol
Why everytime cody himself, dragging his body to the rope so easily he can get beatin by someone, common not same mistake everytime, this lead me thinking he did purposely just to lose.. 😭
This match was meh
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 looked like this was a good match
Predictable but entertaining.   Roman will lose tomorrow and then Roman will blame Rock for the loss. Then that will be set up for Roman vs Rock next year.
What title belt is Rock holding????
lesss gooo bloodline on top
Even the Avengers didn't win in the first round  We're in endgame now
Cmon philly 😂😂😂
Seth太垃圾了...不應該和Seth組隊的.....應該和CM punk組隊
When the rock said if you count I will fire you got me dead😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hate lighing in this wm .
CODY WILL FINISH THE STORY BELIEVE THAT EVERYBODY!
Duelo de titanes suerte Para Los cuatro 😂
The rock looks like he hasnt missed a step.
The rock still has it...The GOAT...
WWE has sucked since Roman became the champion. Yes I know it's staged, but that dude can't wrestle at all.
Seth should have minded his business 🤷‍♂️
No losing clause in his contract 😂. I thought it was a joke but damn... That's true.... Final boss...
Boooooo
Its kinda of weird after what happened in the match. To a fans entertainment value they want rollins and cody win rather. Than rock and regins. Also i found on my own the reason they won rock with reigns  what to due passing the real people champ for ali in the hof. Kinda of a look warm win tbh.
Why?!??????!?!
The crowds trash cause they’re all on they’re damn phones
It's Philly, the crowd was already drunk and tired by the time the thing started
Best Match In WM History
Seth & Cody looking at rock like “ you waving that title around like you beat someone for it “ 😂😂😂😂😂 belt is super fire tho 🔥🔥🔥
The slowest ppls elbow of all time 😂 but still nostalgic
Roman looks so old damn.
All the build up to it and the match delivered in spades!
How to destroy CODY RHODES and SETH ROLLINS in wrestle mania...
La escenografía se ve que sigue siendo la misma en todas las ultimas wrestlemanias, ya no es lo mismo
Y'all can hate Vince but the man knew how to make spectacle. Night one felt like a regular PLE, mid af. Paul better over deliver tomorrow night. No more scapegoat.
The crowd being dead is the reason why they gotta start putting PLEs outside of the US
I hate the fact that they did not have Wade Barrett in commentary for WM
Oh! Come on
A vitória do Cody amanhã só vai ser ainda mais gloriosa passando por cima do Roman com Bloodline e tudo.
match all is average in the first night
Should’ve been the rocks theme from 2001 at survivor serious. Not Hollywood rock from 2003.
Aknowledge him a goat
Solid match. A bit worried that Philly is on Rock/Roman’s side. Are we that burnt out on Cody’s story? Tomorrow will be so interesting.
Rocks gonna rock bottom Roman tomorrow for that spear lol
We're in the Endgame now
The crowd was on their stupid phones for the entire time
Good for The Rock having his first (full length) match in 11 years and actually delivering.
Cody getting whipped so much i'm starting to think he's a slave 😂
I was wondering what is Cody Rhodes going to do if he lost
I told yall on RAW this week.. bringing Lil Wayne to WM40 was the worst decision ever made! Dude barely mumbling during that entrance and then Jey vs Jimmy match was a huge disappointment 😮‍💨😪
The rock was cheating the entire fight.
Cinema
Cry smarks cry😂.
10:07 for you mama Rhodes just finish your story God danm it cody, your holding up the line...
Cody winning tomorrow is going to be ELECTRIC
Mofo sits out 10 years then comes back towards end of the season and inserts himself without even wrestling.
They had to have bloodline rules to make cody's win tomorrow something to remember
Safe to say it ain't looking so good for Cody tomorrow 😔
Am I the only one thinking him being the final boss means he’s the one that will dethrone Roman and who Cody will have to beat to finish his story?
Well this is it Cody and Seth lost, but night 2 Cody wins
I'm calling it Cody is walking out at philly at night 2 as champ I'm praying for it
Rock chơi bẩn😂😂😂
No no no. The original winners are Cody Rhodes and Seth rollins.
The crowd was AWFUL
Finally we can see Solo Sikoa sing the national anthem tomorrow before the main event 🎉🎉
Roman win again😮
Night 2. *Glass Shatters* ITS STONE COLD.
Never do Wrestlemania in Philly again, the show was great, only reason people saying night 1 was mid LITERALLY is because of this horrendous crowd
Damn….Cody’s screwed. I wanna believe that he can finish the story but we’ll see.
Cody cry babies should understand storylines
☝️
We Want Cody !!!
this match will be good
Pretty quiet crowd... Rock takes a lot of Roids.   Night one is a wrap.
The rock curang seharus nya diskulifikasi 🫵🏻🖕🏻👎🏻
That belt hit reigns. 😂😂😂😂
When are we gonna accept that Rock is a Heel lmaooo 😂😂  I luv it! How can you not root for that Epic entrance!! 😅😅
Roman Reigns planted the seed by spearing The Rock. He'll misunderstandly seek for revenge in the form of betraying Roman Reigns.
Wrestlemania 🔥💯💯💯
Thank you @wwe for posting this
Bro this is awesome bro keep the tribal chief where he at and keep the rock the same this is top tier only reason i watch
So was this match bloodline rules too? So now with no official DQ the championship match now favors the challenger.
The rock still got it 😎
Philly has 0 passionate sports fans, bunch of bums
dont worry guys, wwe is fake! 😅😅😅
Dang, cody getting pinned likley means he wont be pinned tomorrow :( i like him but lets be real, the day after he wins we begin to deflate, nothing he does as a face champ can top what we have right now, no face can. Cody deserves his day but not right now, hes better on the chase
I thought in the beginning its a sound of helicopter leading into Hollywood rock entrance just like 2003 but my hope is up 😞
To the people who say the crowd was dead: You probably werent there because the place was electric for when it mattered.
☝️🩸
I can't describe the hype when Rock made his entrance, Indeed felt like a final boss.
Philly crowd is dead.
The look on Rock’s face after being speared by Roman got me. He sold that real well. 😂🤣👏
Brock, i know you are here. Please come out here and save Cody in Night 2
It was freezing cold foh 😂😂 people aren’t gonna be chaotic
pretty good match but the crowd was deader then my grandma
I can see this win a mile away 😂 Great Match nonetheless and damn, Roman and Rock really had that winning physique 💯🔥 Bloodline rules will make night 2 more interesting 😏
Dam this match was straight fire exceeded expectations loved every minute of it a true classic 🔥🔥🔥
There's a 99.99% chance of Cody winning tomorrow especially after Cole said Cody is screwed
You count you’re fired the rock 🪨 s menace and has no chill
Entrance was great everything else was not so much. Lame
Can't lie Cody should lose. His story should have ended last year. This year feels meh. 3 times reigns title should have ended was with Jay, Cody or sami.
This match definitely delivered from start to finish. There’s no doubt in my mind now that Cody will win tomorrow night❤
Wrestlemania 40 Night 1 was insane and badass.
The entrances be dking the most
Am I the only who felt that the Rock was a little stiff and the others were to go easy on him. I mean it figures considering his age but he can't go one on one at his age. If he does, iy will be a terrible match
6:59 The Look on The Rock's face after that spear, he sold that Perfectly.   This Tag Team Match was Awesome! And Rock threatening the referee not to count was Hilarious. The Bloodline Rules match is gonna be Insane, But we might see some shocking returns to help out Cody and Finish his Story.
holy wwe gotta be the biggest meme of all time what the hell even is this lolol
Overall a really good match. Im 50/50 with the ending but im definitely excited for tomorrow
The crowd was so bad loool can't believe how bad it was. Just do it in the UK. US fans are so dry.
I wish cenas there tomorrow
2024 Roman Reigns spears The Rock - Rock's reaction * he thinks ,,ow my stomach'' 😫 2003 Goldberg spears The Rock - Rock's reaction same
The rock has not missed a step man’s the goat foreal this was the match of the night straight legendary everyone performed great🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is the match still gonna be on tmr
There is only one word to describe Wrestlemania XL Night 1 ... ... ... ... MEDIOCRE  💩💩💩
This is basically do or die and now or never for Cody. The fact that his match against Roman will be Bloodline Rules on Night 2, he’s up against all the odds.  Losing again is no option anymore. This is a guy who has beaten Seth Freakin Rollins at Hell in a Cell with a torn pec, defeated Brock Lesnar twice at Backlash and SummerSlam, and he won back-to-back Royal Rumbles. All that just to lose again and the whole cycle kept repeating all over again.
Seth cost Roman first🔥 WrestleMania main event 31  Roman cost Seth first🔥 WrestleMania main event 40   Full circle 🎉🔥
That visual of the WM stage alongside with Rock's entrance was such a vibe. Felt like a true final boss.
The rock entrance give me goosebumps, But dead crowd
I bet where gonna get an anime type ending. It Would be epic if they do shot of Cody prior to his entrance back stage where he looks defeated already but then you see a line of WWE stars who all have been screwed by the bloodline there to support him and at the end of the line In gorilla, is Cena and Austin, telling him to finish damn the story.
Dmm!!! 100％ boring
Best match of night one
Follow me guys
there rock is cooking
Cody parece una mierda a frente de la roca 😂😂😂😂😂
Roman spears the rock, Also Roman hesitated to tag the rock in. Maybe tommrow the rock is gonna betray Roman reigns🤔 what are y’all thoughts?👇
The rock is the best go ever do it especially at his age ! 🔥 he makes these young dudes look average
That was crazy when Cody hit the rock bottom to Dwayne on the announce table and then Roman spearing Rollins through the barricade.
This was a slap and spit from The ROCK who was screaming in the comments that he can’t go more than 5 minutes
I smell betrayal tom night HAHAHAHA
☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻
Story finish
WWE universe rocks❤
be nice to see  all the  opponents  reigns has faced to be on the side of  dustin for their battle tomorrow stoping all interfeance from the BLAH  line
The crowd was TERRIBLE! Anyway, now that they lost the tag match, I have hope that Cody will win tomorrow. Or at least that's what I want to happen. PLEASE!!
Mania at Milwaukee next year please
Ungrateful crowd.
cody rhodes wins royal rumble twice just to get buried lmaooo.
Aside from this match the whole night was kinda underwhelming - I was expecting some surprise appearances / promos just got the matches let’s hope for better night tomorrow but 10/10 main event for first night!
I loved this match, the start was a little slow but then they cooked and it was great fire 10/10. Sami vs Gunther was so good, me, my mom, brother, and friend cheered SO LOUD after that masterpiece and Sami defeating gunther
The main event was top, the rest boring.
Hell yeah
the dog
Follow me 🎉
Team Cody - Like Team Roman - Comment
Ngl ROCK AND ROMAN is a great duo
Para los que odian a Román reings les digo algo a roman reings no le importa que lo odien el es rudo j😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️❤❤❤❤
Loved night one but the crowd was mid
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤باسسسسسسسسسسبرووووووززننمم😊
Rock's selling is still as good as ever, Especially that spear sell was top notch.
Tonight Roman reigns vs cody is bloodline rules... 💯🩸❤️☝️☝️☝️💥🔥🔥🔥
Can't wait too see the roman vs rock most definitely a summer slam show down
Spoiler . . . . . . . . Considering how this match ended I can't wait Roman to finally drop the pissing belt tommorow
No match I thought was bad the USO one was not the most exciting but it was a psychological story like in anime where one person is simply outclassed  I enjoyed the rest of the matches I did not expect Sami to win so that was shocking and the tag match definitely delivered night 1 in my opinion was good to great not quite fantastic like 17 but only half the story has been told I hope Cody and Bayley win tomorrow
Bro I can't wait for tomorrow 🔥🔥🔥
First night was a C-. The last match and the six team ladder match were the best matches.
We want cody to win dis match
😢 no!
HEY WWE CAN YOU UPLOAD THE FULL MATCH!!!!
Loved watching my favorite wrestler of All-time(The Rock) wrestle again. All 4 men put on a very good performance. The Rock and Roman Reigns winning was the right decision. Makes tomorrow night so much more interesting. Hoping we get a Stone Cold Steve Austin appearance. The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin face to face again 25 years AFTER WrestleMania 15.
Whoever put together that post show highlight package deserves a raise for his or hers choice of music.
The Rock will end up betraying Roman so that Cody will finish his story tomorrow 😅
I can not wait for tomorrow! Let's see if that rumor about the appearance of John cena and Stone cold comes true, this will be like endgame!
Code the best among all ❤you
The Rock face expression was priceless when Roman Reigns speared him. 😂😂 6:59
Every like I will do a sit up ⬆️
Very good match but hopefully Night 2 is overall better night
😎👍
Probably the best WrestleMania 🔥 in modern era
All they do is cheat.I hate dem!
Predicting tomorrow Rock will betray Roman!
Let's keep it real, The Rock still got it.
The rock is the final boss!
👆🏻Bloodline rules tomorrow, Roman got this
Cody es el luchador mas lloron de toda la wwe porque el hace promesas que nno cunplira es un llorón apestoso que cae mal es como un político y pobre de la gente que lo quieren jj me dan pena 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The rock really saves night 1 WM 40.
The tribal chief looking leaner
☝️☝️☝️☝️
😱😱😱😱😱😱
Cody sucks
“If you count, you’re fired”. The Rock is a menace and has no chill. 😂🤣 4:30
Use this as like button for The Rock’s entrance.
I love your videos ❤❤❤❤
the build up was perfect, the hype, the promos, really thought jey vs jimmy would steal the show, but i was wrong, this match ended up carrying the show, and also rock sold that spear really well.
So stupid
AGUANTE TALLERES!!!!!!!!!!
I think the time to Brock Lesnar for Save Cody Rhodes
This match was absolute cinema! 🔥
This match absolutely cooked 10/10 🔥
Roman reigns is the goat
Here so fast it was uploaded 45 seconds ago. We knew this was gonna happen
10/10 MAIN EVENT! CINEMA!
Rocks entrance was incredible
What a match, Rock looked great despite his age Now We need Cody to win tomorrow, WE WANT CODY
They nailed it
W WRESTLEMANIA
☝🏻
