Now Terry calls him Tim, theyre practically besties 😅
No!
The man sporting the charming blonde curls insists upon drinking bourbon from a 'manly' glass.  SMH
I really hate the Tim guy.
Awww, I'm so glad that Brad is part of the Roll Tide family now, but the double no was a good knee slapper 😂.
What does "Roll tide" mean?
“Timothy” is definitely 3 years ago
It would be easier if Terry just served Tim and Pam or better yet just get a spine not giving Tim Gift cards
I was about to point out the difference between burbons and whiskeys after terry said whiskey  Then i realised i was turning into one of those pretentious whiskey drinkers
You better tell Glen & Karen to put that in another glass!
God damn. This is so old. The brick wall, no Pam, the comments calling him Timothy, Brad not saying roll tide
has this been cut?
Bistro huddy 115
Bistro huddy 113
Tim needs some gift cards for this injustice. 😂
I used to be a Tim when I was younger 🤣😂🤣☠️🤣😂
That's exactly how I feel when saying Roll Tide in the comments damnnnnnnnnnn that hits hard
As an Old Crow drinker, i feel slightly attacked. 😂
I enjoy this bunch!
At this point brad just delivers the food, the rest is terry
Give Tim a gift card!  That'll shut him up like it always does!
It’s a row Tie and I know you know better
This one makes me think that the only reason Tim wants the fancy pickle is because Terry convinced him he does haha
This is when Terry first starts calling him Timothy.
There are many reasons why a sick old person can't handle being around little kids and it has to do with stress.  Stress can cause all kinds of physical problems.  You won't understand that until you experience it yourself.  Sorry.
You are so incredibly talented!!
Please let me be patronized in this exact way when I dine out 💅🏾
This is going to make me seem like such a douche.  But seriously, if you have nice whiskey, get youself a glencairne glass, it does enhance the drinking experience a good bit
What does Roll Tide means?
I love how Brad can say “roll tide” now, there’s better relationship development in these skits than a lot of tv shows
Your so la
And just like that, Brad turns into Aaron.
The unrealistic part about these is that Terry would've been banned a long time ago
I think there should be a funny two-parter where Tim gets on Brad's last nerves for that day just because something else happened and he's irritated and Brad ends up looking at him and just go and War damn eagle
❤ the old crow ref. Drink that stuff all the time.
Let’s start a chain  Roll Tide
Drink it as is or leave. I'm not dealing with your macho manly bullshit.
No haha
Don’t you hate ignorant Trumpanzees polluting your dining scene?😅😮😊
Girly ass wine glass😂
I just noticed Tim's hairs is Nicole's in a hat lol
Wtf does roll tide means
I love how Brad tried to get into their thing 😂 "Roll tide!" "No." "No."
He got the full name treatment
"No!" 😂
Im suprised HB doesn't have a dress code! 😂  Unless Timothy is the exception lol...
roll tad
lmao my parents always use those glasses im used to those being for bourbon
NO!😂😅😂😅
Please tell me im not the only one who said NO at the end. 😂😂
I love when redneck terry breaks through to tim
Love this!
The first few tim and Pam videos
"No."
My friend took a job at college football teams as a scout and I told him to pick Alabama for the sole reason of this channel and roll tide
Gotta be "Roll Tide" worthy!
"I need it in a manly glass" is the saaaaadest thing I've ever heard. It must be sooo small
You don't just say "Roll Tide". You speak it with your heart.
It’s literally meant for it that or crystal
Everytime some guy says this about the glasses I apologize and ask if they a 7 years old and don't let girls in their forts
No.  That got me
Wait hold up $20 a shot, I had no idea how poor I was
If, as a server, a customer came up to me and said" manly glass" , I'd give them the glass but with a side eye
Everybody knows no rednecks gonna eat no fancy restaurant 😂😂
How to fool a red neck
Not as redneck but I’m far from hoity toity went to a fancy restaurant ordered a beer and the waiter brings it out and a glass getting ready to pour it ngl I started laughin a bit and told him I’ll just take the bottle and he was laughin bout it too 😂
The best part is how he sounds exactly as angry
All I know is the price of a bottle of bourbon is getting Crazy 🤪 over the last few years single barrel is getting out of hand.
What the f**k kind of Applebee's has Glencairns on the bar?
Timothy is cool as hell
I said no at the same time as them lmao
You can’t say “Roll Tide” without a southern accent 😂  I hate Bama but I have fun saying Roll Tide when my brother plays against them on NCAA
Whiskey and bourbon are different things….
Old crow😂😂😂 can you even still find it? Had it on the bar for the old men on Saturday mornings. Thanks for the memory😂😂😂😂
Terry selling that 20$ shot 😂
Once we had a woman come in ordering a beer but please not in a “men glass” 😂 she got beer in a freaking wineglass 😂😂
TimOTHY.
That full name means serious business 😂
I'm convinced at this point the best way to deal with Tim is to talk over him and bullshit him into believing that whatever money he's spending on the item is worth it (even if it's all on the gift cards)
Timothy
I didn't understand this channel at first. Now I watch it. Pretty decent plot going
An odd glass isn't a big deal. I did asker for a porter at a place and they served me a port. I was genuinely confused, but it was an interesting drink. Think it was at the Cliff House in Fort Bragg CA, its changed names since then
That “NO” at the end killed me!!!! There’s always that guy…
Feels weird not seeing Pam
Can someone tell me why this isnt a show! Did he try to submit this to tbs or another cable show
Your videos are top tier 🤌🏻
What does roll tide even mean
“Manly glass” the fuck does that even mean? Draw a cock and balls on the glass and hand it back to him
I legit forgot these are all the same dude. I saw the short and started thinking about what a Bistro Huddy TV show would look like, and I legit thought, "But what if one of the actors dies?" Then realized how stupid I am.
“Ro’ tahyd!” “Ro’ tahyd!” “Roll tide.” NO!
Damn busted out the "Timothy"
Roll Tide!!! #LLSABAN
Women with five o'clock shadow it's going to be a classic. It's my Halloween costume this year Where's my Tee shirt 👕 🤪. 😊
I can 100% corroborate this. I tend bar in Alabama, and have had so many customers get offended when the belgian beer they ordered comes in a belgian beer glass. "Can i get that in a man glass?" Imagine being immaculated by stemmed glassware.
#RTR!
love it....tims a beast ....roll tide
If I understand the lore correctly. Tim and Pam always complain to get gift cards. It's what they at other restaurants. They try to do the same at bistro but the manager diffuses the situation and they leave satisfied?
I love how these skits have devolved into terry absolutely finessing Tim into basically anything
Just the mention of Old Crow makes my stomach upset 🤢
The "HUH" was perfect war stance
He should make a short where the server snaps at Tim. Should be funny
Haven't seen this guy do anything for a quite a while good to see him back on here again.
I will never understand men being afraid of glass shapes. 😂
I see all these characters as their own separate personalities  I feel like bro really manages a restaurant 😂
$20 a shot lmao
Roll tide No No, you are not roll tiding with us!!!
What does Roll Tide mean... Been watxhing this guy for months and i still dont know
No brad, you ain’t earn that lol
Tim always has this crazed look in his eyes that the other characters lack 😂
WAR EAGLE
Im with Timothy
I understand that its all Drew but I cannot accept that Tim and Bridget are the same person
Tim's one of my favorites by fat lol
I don't want to admit it but when I go to the bar and order a martini I tell them to put it in a cup. I'm not saying it's Sissy, but it's real easy to spill.
Only Brad can tell him “yeah yeah yeah”
Does Tim ever get tired of having a problem with everything put in front of him 😮‍💨
I swear I think this guy followed my uncle around...or already met him once to get Tim's character.
What does the roll tide expression mean?
No no roll tide I just can’t 😂😂😂
Lol 😂😂😂
I think it's every time 😂❤😂😂
Roll tide
Calling me out on my old crow at home damn
As someone who isnt from america what does roll tide mean?
No! 😂
Terry lied through his teeth with that initial "I speak redneck" quip. That's a good ol' boy right there, he just learned to dress it up for business
Would’ve been more accurate using sissy🤣
Toxic masculinity at its absolute stupidest. I went on a date once with a guy who needed to change out his glass and I was so unattracted immediately.
Fellas, is it gay to drink?
What does roll tide mean 😂
Easily my favorite content creator especially being somebody who’s served at every restaurant under the sun damn near. He’s so spot on and funny. Love when people make money off social media that actually deserve it. He puts efforts into these characters and skits and accents. He deserves every penny he makes unlike some of the people I see on this app. This is real entertainment 👍
We need to see a video where we fond put tim and terry are related
For the longest time i thought it was Hubby ..lol
I was mid swallow of my tea when they both said "no". Almost spat it back up laughing. Love your channel Drew!
Brewzle would say otherwise
Roll tide 😅
Wtf is role tide
DONT GIVE A PISS BOUT NOTHIN BUT THE TIDEEEE
What dose roll tide mean 😂😂
Honestly I didn’t think I liked Terry but now I kinda wish he was my boss back when I was working in a bar. Always there for his crew.
This man is very talented
Wow, the difference vs newer skits. Your character development is absolutely amazing
The guy that invented all the different glasses is laughing in his grave
Lol this guy has it going on...love the content
Brother you are talented
This aint old crow you throwing back at home Terry just kills me
No!! Hahaha Drew’s hilarious!
♡
Gold 🏅😂
Only terry can say roll tide. Except that time the cooks did lolol 😂
They probably have a funnel back on the kitchen for your beers. 😅
I love this channel.  Grew up working in restaurants
Go Vols🎉
I love how Terry knows to be on call to deescalate whenever these two come in—but I feel like it’s also kinda like seeing his buddies too 😊
Why do they keep letting them come back to the restaurant?
Go Blue!
I can't imagine my masculinity being so fragile that it can be threatened by glassware 😵‍💫
Does anybody perhaps know what “Roll Tide” means?
Brads like you know what, Im not even gonna try 😂
A manly glass, WTF is a manly glass!
Wait who's the server?
Love the regulars. They come for comfort. Ie speak to me like family. Shove it UP
lmao
I’m with Tim that not that kind of glass to pour whisky 😅😂😂
Poor Brad just wants to be part of it
I love that this character is stupid and doesn’t know it
Terry has great customer service skills when dealing with Tim.
Poor Brad is trying lol
Ha
Old crow. My high school drinking days. Still have a bottle.
War Eagle
Imagine having customers that u have to get terry to fix everythime terry should just be their server to save everyones time from these complaining ass rednecks
Wow I just started these videos and Brad has totally been in on the Roll Tide Curious to see he's come a ways to get it
Manager No! I just fixed this situation don't come back here and ruin it.
nope just give me a reg glass plz
We need an episode for Brad to stand up for himself and to get Tim’s respect
The way he's so freaked out by it though 😂
Tim just needs things on his level! He spends good money!
Tim and Pam are the best 😂
Are we sure he just doesn’t have a crap Load of twins?
At least give a proper whiskey glass, i have fancier glasses at home than most restaurants near where i live
Rednecks vs Nicole would be fire  "So order a cheaper burger"
How much money does Timothy have!?
Ban college sports. Ban professional sports while we're at it. People are too stupid and distracted now.
Timothy is renarkably agreeable as soon as you give him some facts.
I have watched a lot of these but I still don't know what roll tide is😅😅😅
War eagle!
Are they saying roll tide or low tide?
“Roll tide” “👀NO” 😂
Whats roll tide?
Poor Brad is never going to win over Tim.
As someone  from ky. It just might as well be old Barton.  Old crow is 4x to expensive for what it is😂😂😂. Also you know how tired i get when i traven and they say. This is a ky burban or ky whisky.  ME: which 1 cause me might fight if you give me hevean hills and tell me its the best.😂😂   No joke, was in Florida, an as they tried to serve me heaven hills, for $10 a shot.  For those  that  dont know. I can buy a handle of that crap for $12.😂
Maybe it’s just me having grown up around backwater ass family but my god I hate the character of Tim. He reminds me of everything I hated about living in idaho
I know it's a bit, but these specific types of videos from Drew really shows that for a lot of people, it's less of what you explain to them, but how you explain it. I really feel like that matters more,  more often than not.
"Girly ass wine glass" Lyrical genuis
War damn eagle was definitely brad
Knowing your audience as a sever 👌
What the heck is roll tide
I said Roll Tide to a friend the other day and got funny looks. 😂😂
If you can’t join them, then pull a Buddy Pine and become the villain. That’s who the “War Damn Eagle” came from in another BH short.
Not only are these little storylines great, the acting is unexpectedly good, and the character development actually effective, but I’m also regularly struck by how knowledgeable he clearly is about the industry and how clear it is that he must be a great server.
They should be sayin go vols instead
Bradley or brad thought he was apart of the crew
I love how at this point they’re on a first name basis and the manager’s being more firm, lol
I would absolutely bring back one shot of whiskey in a plastic soda cup
Play nothing makes me change the channel more than people doing shity Southern accents.
I am from Billingsley, Alabama. Look it up for reference.  That "NO." didn't come from hate, but instead from the heart.
“Role tide” “No”. 😂
More tim and Pam they are my favorite characters Roll tide!!
This guy should consider acting
War eagle
“Rolltide!” “No!” “No!”
I stopped using shot glasses a long time ago. I'm not gonna down a bottle of $80 bourbon in a shot glass.
The ending🤣
I just heard my state raise it's head like a sleeping giant at the "girlie ass wine glass" sir our Bourbon is art. You don't put it in an Ikea poster frame my dude.
GIRLIE A** GLASS ROLL TIDE 😂😂😂😂😂
Feels lik Tim ASKS for brads table lol
Okay but my family has those glasses because we have found that we break fewer whiskey glasses than juice glasses, we literally pour fruit juice in them exclusively instead 😂
No.
Those glasses are great if you taste a, or in best case a few, Whisky('s) you never tasted.  But gods, how I despise them when I just want to drink a doubled of my favorite one. Just give me a tumbler ffs, especially if I ask for it...
🤣🤣🤣
Damn even Terry was like "gtfoh"
Poor Brad. Lol
Its Tim calling it a "girly ass wine glass" 😅
Rolltide!!!!
Someone tell me what roll ride means?? Lol
//Vent warning//    I can’t stand being here anymore, I feel like I’m annoying my friends and no one truly loves me. I’m falling behind in school. I’m failing most of my classes. And I’m just so sick of everything. I’m sick of getting yelled at, I’m sick of crying all the time, I’m sick of feeling like shit, I can’t do it anymore. Why can’t I be better? Do they even like me? Do I like me? My own dad forgot when my birthday was, he’ll be with my step siblings at their choir practice while I cry in my room. I can’t talk to my parents because what will they say? They won’t care. They won’t do anything. My dad was depressed living with my mom, and so he left. He left me. He left my siblings. And soon it’ll be my turn to leave. I don’t want to leave. But if I don’t I’ll continue to be underweight and refuse to eat for no reason, I won’t get the help I need. But I can’t leave, because what about them? Maybe my feelings are stupid and I have no reason to feel this way. Oh well, who cares, am I right?
That glass will help you burst the blood vessels in your nose.
This needs to be a full show not just a short. Someone needs to pick this up and make it happen..
Just put the bourbon in a bourbon glass. Unless it’s scotch it doesn’t belong in there
It blows my mind that some men think that whiskey in a glencairn or a manhattan in a couple glass is "girly", like what????
Brad doesn’t have the ‘roll tide’ pass 😂
It’s the No x2 that gets me 😂
Do Tim and Pam eat there every night!? 😂
Roll Tide Roll Tide
I will never get used to men acting like anything in their vicinity that doesn't fit their hypermasculine self-image is a personal attack against their masculinity. Like, relax dude! The glass of whiskey isn't trying to castrate you the second you let your guard down!
What’s Roll tide?
Men refusing to allow anything remotely girly into their life is the single most insecure trait a human can have
I don't give a damn if I moved to Tuscaloosa I'll never say Roll Tide I might be southern but I've never kissed a cousin
Your not using it right again.
You have to explain the glass is mechanically made for the beverage that is in it. Assuming they are using the correct glass
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If you’re so afraid of turning gay, maybe you already are😉
Timothy? Try again.
That poor bartender 😅😂
Whats with the Roll tide?
Old crow is the name of an actual dive bar where I live 🤣🤣🤣
I wanna see Nicole serve Tim and Pam
Hahaha "roll tide" "No" "No" 🤣🤣
NO
Dang, they gave him the double nopes 😂
NEVER TIRE OF THE EVENTS AT THE BISTRO  ROLL TIDE
Manly glass 😂
What is rolltide?
They really wouldn’t let him sit at their table lol
you should make full episodes
Not yet Brad, not yet.  Hey when do we have Pam and Tim served by Nicole or Bridget?
Noo😭😂😂
20 a shot? Hell naw.
I don't know how I feel I love my Old Crow .
old crow you make at home.
What does roll tide mean
Roll Tide
No?
Roll Tide
I love how good the manager is at settling the customer down and getting him to agree with them.
Terry’s ability to flip Tim’s mind in a second is amazing I need that skill
im just waiting for that waiter to snap, its going to happen one day, dealing with someone that CONSTENTLY calls for the manager about everything you do will drive anyone insane
Drew are u from Alabama
Whisky is spelled wrong especially how you mentioned a scottish Whisky
lol  no
War dam eagle!!!!
Clint would have known
I get the joke amd all but i hated managers like this who cater to absolutely trash customers.
Boomer Sooner
Are any of these based off true stories lol
What does roll tide mean
At some point we need someone to come by and say “war eagle” just to get ‘redneck’ all riled up
In that moment we all said "no"
He is not wrong.  That is one girly glass.
The idea of "girly/manly" glasses is the stupidest thing ive ever heard im my life. If you need a fucking drinking glass to reconfirm that you are what you say you are, youre not what you say you are. Love these skits
Manly glass...geez
oof..i shuddered when he said Old Crow.
What is roll ride? The don’t look like surfers
I'm way too invested into this group of characters 😂😂😂
That's good stuff on time. Right on
tim is really an open-minded man, but mostly because terry is an excellent communicator lol
Love the voice overlap - adds to the great character work, and sounds like a real convo among several people.  Awesome job!
Hey I'm a welder . Don't go put in my Wells garage and some fancy container. Because I'm a serious Wilder.  They're going to well the same. The bourbon will drink just find out of the bottle.
Roll tide! Roll tide! Roll tide…? 😂😂😂
Huh......I laughed at this 3 months ago? .....Roll tide!
I want him to ask for a bud lite😂
Imagine your masculinity being so fragile that you're triggered by glassware.
I was waiting for this one for sooo long!!
Look it's crystal
$20 DOLL HAIRS A SHOT! 😱😱😱😱😱
Terry is able to convince Timothy of anything if he just ends at all with roll tide😂
Tbf, its a pretty accurate depiction of how to get a reocurring customer.
Terry always stands up for the server
Ah yes. Being intimidated by a glass shape is the peak of manliness
Roll Tide.....
What’s wrong with throwing it into a manly glass though? Sounds more like they just want to impose their will on Timothy. Timothy will one day be like “there is no reason why you can’t just give me a regular glass. None. Now give me an empty glass or a glass filled only a quarter of water because I’m not that thirsty. *”accidentally” spills the little bit of water* whoops. *pours whisky into his new manlier glass* whoops again. Roll tide *shot guns it back*
This guy is so great, keep making these videos
No.
Bro, that glass is made so you can savor every whiff. If I pour this puppy in a manly glass, you might as well drink dish water. No Roll Tide, just tryna make this bourbon worth its 20$
😂😂😂😂,
I agree with Tim, get that shit outahere
Roll tide mean okie?
roll eagle and war tide
ROLLTIDE !!!
You know, that was the most "Roll Tide" on board Brad has EVER been that didn't have a hint of sarcasm, and they just antied his energy. Brad, no offense, but you deserve better. Also, pretty sure you can find it. There's a billion kitchens out there.
Now I know why Brad never says roll tide 😂
$20 for a shot??
Timothy met his wife at a family reunion with all that “roll tide” talk
I love how TERRY tells Brad “No” on the roll tide 😂
Bridgette is too nice to blame the manager (at least to his face)
War damn eagle
Take that hat off!!
Sorry, I’m new, what does “roll tide” mean?
What does rolltide mean?
"No." "No." LOL
Roll Tide!
Old crow is moonshine
What does throwing old crow mean?
Most places will give you a shitty tumbler glass instead of a proper whiskey glass. Sad.
no😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wait people don't drink whisky in glasses in the US? Why?
I like how they always shut the young dude down when he says rolltide
Back when Brad couldn't say Roll Tide. How times change.
I love that this series isn't about dunking on rednecks, it's about properly communicating to help people understand unfamiliar cultural concepts.
Good on Tim for being open to new things
Lol. I love how they are like “no” on Brad. Poor guy just wants to be part of the team. But his timing was way off.
I love the character development.  At first, they're upset about Brad saying "Roll Tide." In the skit about the complaint,  Brad expresses concern that it might have been Tim who complained because he forgot to say "Roll Tide" back.
How does he afford to eat there so much??
old crow priceless
I like how he tries to Roll Tide from time to time lol.
Roll tide, been saying this now thanks to Timmothy 😅
I really don't like this guy I am from the south and none of whst he does is true
“Roll tide” “Roll tide” “Roll tide” “No!” Mumbles as walking away “I went there” Lmao thatd be pretty accurate too
They denied him that Roll tide 😂
Lmao I’m from KY and SC, both have two different types of country ppl. Now I know this is bama ppl, but honestly ppl in NC, SC, and TN act the exact SAME WAY. Instead of roll tide they say “go cocks!” Anytime anyone has a SC game cocks shirt on or hat. It’s like a cult lol. Now KY ppl are… well let’s just say inbred and IN THE BREAD. Lmao
Noooo😂😂😂
Can’t believe you just dropped some Old Crow. Woof
Roll tide hell yeah 😂
Love the shout out to Old Crow
Because of you, I bought these glasses for Valentine’s Day. I had never heard of them before. Bf is a scotch drinker and loves them. They’re cheap but shipping is expensive. Best place to get them is steal them from your workplace.
I love how you can really tell drew is from the south. These are not caricatures, these are inflections of very real people
Dude looks at a glencairn and calls it girly.
I am just WAITING for the day that Brad manages to successfully persuade Tim in something himself, even ending with a "Roll tide." It will be beautiful.
Thats the difference between drinking whisky 🥃 and bourbon 🤮.
No you can’t say it like that it’s “rOll tIde”
There are nice looking tumblers you don't put a man's whiskey in that weird hoitytoity girl glass.
At this point Tim will accept just about anything if Terry is the one explaining it.
Stumbled upon this masterpiece a few months ago out of randomness. I have no regrets.  You are a talented person,and I'm invested in the storyline.  Roll tide
Does ANYONE else notice that Terry is the only person who NEVER looks in the eyes of the guests he’s speaking to? Lmfaooooooo
You should make a short with the red neck and someone who is Terry. I think it would be fun
Fuck no
Manly glass? 🤦🏽‍♂️
Most of your new videos end with "roll tide" and it's confusing.  I even looked it up but doesn't explain what it means outside of football.  Please explain.
This is one of the best with tim... I love it.. you doing a redneck. You should do one with a Texan
He tried 🤷
I love the roll tide bit so much. I wrote "Rock Chalk Jayhawks" on one of my customers receipts when he used his KU credit card one time. He asked for me every time after that. (I don't even like college football, but I'm from Kansas and heard it all the time)
A girl glass haha
That last roll tide was perfect
Brad always trying to relate to the "normies"...
Ohhh bad juju with this one. Naperville Il some guy kied another guy over a Stella Artois glass
$20 for a shot? That had better be a seriously well aged single malt .
What’s roll tide
As a southerner yes
NO
For as much as Timothy frequents the Bistro, you guys really ought to start letting him have his way on things.
First, love the series. Second, I want to see an episode where Timothy shows up for lunch, orders their new item, the Italian beef, gets all pissy over the giardiniera. "What the hell? Who the hell put these pansy-ass carrots and celery all over my damn beef sammich? I came here for beef, dammit! Imma give the chef a piece of my mind!" He goes in the back, and there's Carmy from The Bear in the middle of a full-blown meltdown, screaming obscenities, hurling dry sharpies, the two line chefs sitting in the corner in tears. Ten minutes later, Timothy walks out, white as a sheet, muttering "R-roll tide."
Gay nights are made from the The emperor's genes not from any left over hero chapter unit
Them: Roll tide  Him: Roll tide 😃  Them: You don’t get to say it!
Literally the only place I've seen Old Crow is at the bar. Can you buy it from real stores?
War eagle
um, what is the "roll tide" about, anyway? I been watching this series for weeks now, never heard it before or since.
The waffle house has found its new host
The waffle house has a new host
The Waffle House Has Found Its New Host
The Waffle House has found its new host.
The Waffle House has found its new host
The Waffle House has found its new host
Even terry saying no is just perfect. Ir makes the "roll tide" between him and tim more special
My ex in laws were from Bama. At the end, the “roll tide” and nope…felt that on a spiritual level. 😂
I’m watching Terry handle this guy and as a customer service employee these videos NEED to be part of customer service orientation. Specifically with Terry and this customer
I Love saying roll tide but dont even know the meaning 🤣🤭
i wanna know whats in the glencairn. also cannot find a glencairn for the life of me.
That ending! Yaaaas!!!
"This glass was designed by scotsmen who throw logs for fun."
War eagle!
look.. we know when your roll tide isn't sincere. so don't do it.
Tim's emphatic "No", lololololol
Should be able to knock those type of people out when they act all country
😂😂😂😂Roll Tide!
Terry always saves the day what a guy
Just once I wana see someone yell ‘go razorbacks’ and watch all hell break loose
Terry and Timothy must be friends lol
Just pour the drink in a plastic Dixie cup and let him drink it out behind the ole Piggy Wiggly on Route 41.
I wish The Bistro Huddy would kick Tim out of the restaurant.  He's always a problem.  LOL!
I guess south and north carolina accent goes all the way to the west coast.
I’d be like “oh, you want a regular rocks glass huh? Well that might be fine if you have to make do back at your trailer. But here, we have 26 different types of glassware, and you’re already drinking out of the optimal choice.
Watch the fancy glasses disappear lol
Roll tide
😂😂
Terry is the perfect example of what significance are the "soft skills".
U need to make a movie … and find a way to charge ………….. I most definitely would buy a copy
Critique: GO DAWGS!
The girly drinks taste amazing and get you drunk. But go ahead, keep drinking those manly yeast water drinks that taste like watered down piss
Drew thank you for all your videos. Keep it up man!!
https://youtube.com/shorts/VGGBcwkxHqA?feature=share  Show this to Tim. Lololol.
I would kill for that platinum curly hair ❤
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nooo
How did you get from Cali to Bama?
Manly glass?! Lmao 😂
Psychology at work
“no”
The waiter has not yet earned his " roll tide" privileges.....
Why are they allowed to keep raping me at night and use imposters to steal
Aww Brad starting to feel left out of their friendship
The more and more i watch this series the more i just disrespect the first waiter. it becomes less getting respect from the costumer and more just knowing why things are things. Why is that glass like that. Why is a burger so expensive. Timothy just wants to understand and says it in a crude way.
Roll Tide!!
" ROLL TIDE!" ( Not you , Guillermo.)
No!🤣🤣
Gotta love that ROLL TIDE! HMM NOO
Tim is a true fish out of water story
Roll tide
It kul- chul-cha!!!! Does Timothy have a velvet Elvis btw?
On one episode you should write in a new character into the show who last litterally two episodes where we meet him the couple gets to enjoying him super well but then in some M. Night Shabamamabannanablammawamma style of twist he turns out to actually be related to them but has to go back home
I'm from Africa nd im loving roll tide
Wtf is roll tide?
Even us Scots don't use them fuckin things... Thats why it comes down n a bottle...it's a glass...Roll Tide
The waiter doesn't have the R-word T-word pass :/
We have a new student in our building (in Kansas) who joins us from Alabama. I said “well, Roll Tide” and he said “I don’t know what that means.”
No,No 😆 🤣
He just wanted to be included :(
I fucking hate this
Before I raise holy hell up in here  My dads words
I keep commenting "roll tide" but then I delete it because I'm from Michigan 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So, you're telling me alabama fans are imbeciles? K
Wait are people from out of state not allowed to say "roll tide"?
No! That is our word!
And here i am drinkin from a bubble of a burp tank that came off of a deuce and a half
😂😆 Girly Ass...PRICELESS! 💯
Aww, he’s trying
I'm genuinely curious, do managers step in and handle situations like this when customers are unnecessarily hostile?
This series has an American "Letterkeny" feel to it🤣
Also terry has a silver tongue and skilled 10 in charisma
Istg terry saying “no!” Is amazing character development hes basically saying “roll tides me and Tim’s thing” (even if they are a pain sometimes)
Terry is a class act, yet somehow has no problem relating to Tim.
“No”🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
War Eagle
It'd be funnier if he came back and said war eagle the last time.
No 😂
I got to stand with Timothy on this one
I love all his skits. I worked in a restaurant in college. All these characters on point. He should show the guys out back by the dumpsters smoking M. 😀
They would refuse his service and not allowed back.
Put✍️ Timothy✍️ in✍️ ”girly”✍️ urn✍️ after✍️ death✍️
Hahahha he trying put my whiskey in a girly ass glass!! Aaah classic
I work in a restaurant so I absolutely love this series lol  Roll tide
aint noone like that
What in the fuck does Roll Tide mean???!!!
It's Bourbon not whisky. Americans really don't know how to drink and make booze
Roll Tide
No
Glad that Brad try to get along with Tim but still, “no”
No
I’m sorry what does roll tide mean I been trying to figure it out is it a inside joke
Terry resolved Timothy's issue in record time. "Roll Tide" came a lot faster than I expected 😂
Glencarn glass is actually really good for whiskey.
Derp eyes IRL
I bought a Roll Tide shirt when I was in Florida even though I have zero knowledge, affiliation, or love for any Alabama team. 100% because of this.  I also love how Terry has the exact dress code of every manager I've ever worked with.
gosh the ending tho XD
I love them telling him no when he tries to roll tide
The "No" keeps sending me. I've been dead for 4mins and counting
War Eagle!
Roll tide
Timothy is the only one who can twist Brad the stud up.  lol.  He's one of my favorites
Just let Terry speak for you. You lost him after glen Carin glass
It would be cool if the other characters could have there own story on how to handle Redneck/Timmy.
Love it

Love how Terry told his own waiter “no” at the role tide. Might be a bit silly, specially in a fictional short, but it still warms my heart that he respects the roll tide phrase.

Rolltide     Rolltide        Roll tide😁 NO!!! 😠
What does « roll tide » mean tho?
Old crow! I thought I was the only one ever heard of that disgusting stuff.
Ok, I was a chef, what the fuck is, "Roll Tide"? is this like a FoH thing?
Now we need the character development where some of the servers finally learn to speak to Timmothy.
Roll Tide ROLL TIDE rOlL tIdE  NO!

THE FUCK IS THAT?!! LOL!!!!!!!!
Nice added role tide rejection best part I’ve seen like 8 of these that was the best part of all of em
Roll tide fr
Roll tide 🤣😎
I love these skits because it's customer service at it's best. This same method works when working with elderly people. There's always that one mean elderly person that people are afraid of. But then you just talk to them like this and find out they're not mean. They're just easily agitated by things or people that don't make sense.
Gotta slap that in a solo cup XD
Roll tide
Do ppl really act like this
My mind is in 2 spots
the "no" is what does it for me
No.
No
Third Roll 🌊 All together nah.....No
Poor waiter tried
I am this close 👌 to going back to Iowa just to say "roll tide" to a random person-
No
I love this series, really goes to show that if someone is causing problems the best thing to do is try understanding and that trying to speak to someone in there language is always better than getting mad
Roll tide
"Rowl Tied" "Rowl Tied"  "Roll Tide"     "NO"
Wtf is 'holy hell' hahahaha.
Thank you. I sure wanted to say that ending But I know I would have gotten eaten up. I'm not saying it because that look and embracement is something else.
Roll
Roll tide!
Roll tide no no
Bro Terry whipped around so fast when he says "Roll Tide"
Noh’!
I've had so many guys ask me to pour cocktails into rocks glasses 😂 "& no fruit!" Or ramble on justifying their drink choice lol I'm like... my guy... you want it because it's delicious. It's all good baby ♡

Manager: Roll tide Tim: Roll tide  Waiter: Roll tide....   BOTH: NO!!!!!!!  😂😂😂
It's  the no at the end for me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 #rolltide

I work at T.R.H. n they play that song whiskey in a wine glass 🥃 🍷. And I hate it😑😐. This totally made me think of that.🤓
The roll Tide makes me laugh every time
😂😂😂 the quickest no ever. He tried
I'd just get him a fucking coffee mug.
Like the skits…
The blue shirt - looks like a young JR Ewing
Excellent skit but it does bare more then a twinkling of being based in reality. Imagine being a waiter and every week some douche nozzle comes in just to complain that you're giving him exactly what he asked for. So they prove they are a total Karen and call for your manager every time to cajole them. Is this how your momma's raised you to behave in public?
What does “roll tide” means?
Don’t know what the bell roll tide means but I’ll be ending every sentence with it

Why, as a Brit, do I feel I’d be the same as this man from down south? I want my whiskey served in a proper glass, I want my steak rare, and I want a bloody Budweiser or a decent lager as a chaser. Men are all the same over...
I feel like all these conversations actually have happened and that makes me so happy that
Hilarious 😆 RTR
Fellas, is it gay to drink bourbon whiskey in a glass specifically designed for the purpose?

See now Tim, when yer goin' to make some grilled cheese when ya ain't feelin' right, you don't just slap some bread and cheese on it an' call it good, you gotta toss 'er in the pan and get it all warmed up. Same thing just diffrn't. Think of the glass like that ol' pan there.

I love the subscription, and threw a series
Roll tide! (The use of software that blocks ads hinders our ability to serve you the content you came here to enjoy.)
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I got a noise complaint from my neighbors for laughing too loudly at the end
Subbed and rang that bell, Go Dawgs!

The Texas State Senate passed Concurrent Resolution 3 (SCR3) on April 15, 2021, condemning the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s involuntary organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience.  Angela Paxton, one of the state senators who introduced the resolution, said after the Senate vote, “Everything about it [the organ harvesting crime] goes against treating individuals with the dignity they deserve simply for being a human being.”  She believes the resolution will serve to educate Texans about the atrocity. She said some people may have heard about it, but they don’t speak up about it and simply treat it as a rumor. But “we want to go on record and say that ‘this is happening’ and we condemn it,” she said.  Donna Campbell, another state senator who sponsored the resolution, said, “That’s an atrocity. That’s a human rights violation that no nation should turn a blind eye to.”  Campbell added, “Hopefully, this resolution will say to the medical community: tell your patients this is wrong. Because I think patients unknowingly become a partner with the murdering of innocent people. There needs to be a global outcry that ‘this is wrong.’ Nations need to sanction China for this kind of behavior.”  Below is the full text of the resolution.  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION  WHEREAS, For the better part of two decades, China's communist regime has been engaged in the vile practice of forcibly removing human organs for transplant; and  WHEREAS, In June 2019, the independent China Tribunal announced its finding that China's regime had for decades practiced systematic forced organ removal from prisoners of conscience; it is believed that organs have been harvested from hundreds of thousands of incarcerated people, mainly Falun Gong practitioners, but possibly also Tibetan Buddhists, House Church Christians, and members of the Uyghur Muslim ethnic minority; and  WHEREAS, China has welcomed an influx of “transplant tourism,” whereby individuals critically in need of transplants pay thousands of dollars for one of 60,000 to 90,000 transplant surgeries conducted each year; the number of transplants far exceeds the number of voluntary organ donations in the country; moreover, Chinese hospitals are able to schedule transplants of major organs within two weeks, suggesting nefarious foreknowledge regarding the “donation” of these organs; by contrast, America's highly developed organ donation system requires that recipients be placed on a carefully curated list to await the transplant of an organ; the timing of these transplants is not predictable, as an organ may not be available for hundreds of days, or in time for a specific patient; and  WHEREAS, Falun Gong, a spiritual practice centered on the values of truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance, became immensely popular in the 1990s; in July 1999, the Chinese Communist Party launched an intensive, nationwide persecution designed to eradicate the spiritual practice; Freedom House reported in 2015 that Falun Gong practitioners are the primary victims of forced organ removal and face an elevated risk of dying or being killed in custody; and  WHEREAS, On July 20, 2020, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced 21 years of persecution of Falun Gong by China's communist regime, declaring in a press statement: “We call on the PRC government to immediately end its depraved abuse and mistreatment of Falun Gong practitioners, release those imprisoned due to their beliefs, [. . .] and address the whereabouts of missing practitioners. Twenty-one years of persecution of Falun Gong practitioners is far too long, and it must end”; and  WHEREAS, United Nations Special Rapporteurs have called on the Chinese government to account for the sources of organs used in transplant practices, and the World Medical Association, the American Society of Transplantation, and the Transplantation Society have all called for sanctions on Chinese medical authorities; resolutions condemning organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience have been adopted by the parliaments of Canada and the European Union, as well as by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States House of Representatives, and it is important to join the international outcry against this major violation of human rights; now, therefore, be it  RESOLVED, That the 87th Legislature of the State of Texas hereby strongly condemn China's practice of involuntary organ harvesting; and, be it further  RESOLVED, That the 87th Legislature of the State of Texas encourage the medical community to educate Texans about the risks of travel to China for organ transplants to help prevent Texas residents from unwittingly becoming involved in murder in the form of forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience; and, be it further  RESOLVED, That the 87th Legislature of the State of Texas respectfully urge the United States Congress and the president of the United States to pass laws and adopt measures prohibiting collaboration between U.S. medical and pharmaceutical companies and any Chinese counterparts linked with forced organ harvesting, banning entry into the United States of those who have participated in unethical removal of human tissues and organs, and providing for the prosecution of such individuals.

Tobit 12:7-10 It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but it is honourable to reveal the works of God. Do that which is good, and no evil shall touch you. Prayer is good with fasting and alms and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold: For alms doth deliver from death, and shall purge away all sin. Those that exercise alms and righteousness shall be filled with life: But they that sin are enemies to their own life.
Just the no. No.

I used to think this. I thought glemcairm glasses were all BS. Then I got given one as a gift, and tried it. It makes everything but the shittiest whiskey taste better, I swear.

Roll tide
Fucking golden series this is keep it up man
You gotta give him some sort of anectdote that he can relate to. It's not funny if he just explains that it's a fancy glass for fancy whiskey. That's not gonna convince anybody.

Tim ol rich ass
“Lis’en ere you Uptown Rhode Island city slicker, Roll Tide ain’t for y’all with a 40 minute commute”

ROLL TIDE
No.
I watched this like five times for the “roll tide” then the immediate “no!”
Shit I was determined not to laugh at this shit but this one got me gigglin
I am far from that part of world, yet its freakin hilarious 😂
The walk up of the manager is classic. Worked at an Applebees in Georgia and it's exactly like this sometimes. Especially with the new $1 drinks or limited food.
Timothy what’s got you riled up tonight 😭😭😭
a manly glass huh? that sounds kinda sus buddy, why you want a glass made of man?
Everytime I hear the roll tide I have to say to myself War Eagle
No!
As an Auburn fan, bahahahahaha

What happened to the “How are you doing tonight sir!?”
🤣🤣🤣
Alright! You got me! I decided I had to subscribe! Every god damn time I pass through this series I’m laughing my ass off. Roll-tide! No! 😂

Lmao I love the fact the waiter knows to get the manager now.  But when he tried to roll tide  NOO
I mean no offense when i say you look like Quagmire lol
Roll Tide
I actually have a glencairn glass, i know what he means.
The "Roll Tide" fucking floored me fam 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Misogyny
It really shows that communication is key, if you're able to understand someone and speak their language you'd be surprised about what they're willing to learn
So great
Dude, your really f%^*n good. Extremely funny. Keep it up. I think you will end up on TV or better if your not already
Nobody acts like that
No at the end. classic.
Roll tide
I spent 8 months in Alabama for work and as an Asian Australian I was quite apprehensive about the South. Long story short, I had an amazing time there, the food is amazing and while there are idiots, just like any place, most of the people I met are warm, ready to help at a moment's notice and really assimilated me into their community. Southern hospitality at its finest.  Go visit Alabama people, roll tide!
The no at the end has me rolling
“No!” “Naw!”
We  Need MORE.
Noooo
🤣
I always say Roll tide in my best Arkansas accent at the end of every one of these, even though I have no idea what it means😂
TAMITHY!

Fucking great. I’m from Minnesota so I don’t know a ton about southern culture, but I was in the Marines and most of the guys I served with were either from the great big north with the deep South. To me I had so many conversations that were like this with my boy from Alabama, but Beau had a real wisdom about him and was good at heart.
Dam now I gotta go pour up! Cheers to the skit.

It’s funny how they all look like the same person yet still so diferent
The fact that this is actually pretty true is the funniest part
Awwww poor waiter he’s just trying his best, but these are some of the funniest short skits.
I love this series
The only way brother that you got this so spot on each and every single time is there some hillbilly in you.... God bless you man you make me laugh every time
Series is not only good, but it's a cool take and lesson on relating to people and giving them perspective on things even if you are different, shows that Timothy is not trash.
I haven't found a single place yet to serve Whiskey in a glencairn.
Well ain't that just my favourite guy .. And he's being looked after so well .. I wanna say Roll Tide too , but I'm not from Alabamy... So , like here , I'm not allowed .. War Eagle ...!
Never heard the term Roll Tide before these videos, now if I don't hear it in these videos I get upset lol.
Im learning more than I would have expected about southern culture bc of researching what some of this stuff means.  Its fun tho and I look forward to more of these skits
The waiter doesn't get to say Roll Tide, that would be cultural appropriation
The roll tide gets me everytime lol
I love this guy 😂
Timothy frequents this restaurant and raises hell so often the manager now knows him on a first name basis. 😄
Hey Pray for Jim Ross
Oh timothy. Always up to something
Dude this is the best roll tide
If you can get someone from the Midwest to agree with you, then you’re on a whole other level
Okay I have to ask...What the fuck does "Roll Tide" mean?

I love that I've found this series, and threw a subscription. This was a good pick me up on a slow day at the shop.   Edit: just here during my lunchbreak on the following day. Thanks for all the likes and comments everyone. I was not expecting any interaction at all, really. Anyways, I'm glad we all enjoy the series so much, this guy deserves the recognition and attention :)
