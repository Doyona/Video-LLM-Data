Dude! Thank you so much for the opportunity to see this in person and letting us hit it. Scary fun!
Man this is the berm peak i subscribed for, great video.  Keep it up !
I’m a big fan how do you do it I’m seven years old love your videos
Have you made a video on how to clean a bike?
Great video and a lot of work. Congratulations!
That box looks oofly like a cushcore box 😉 Love your content 🤘
Self tapping screws are  Amazing
7:59 sweatopolis
This is such a mischiveous design: risk taking the sketchy turn onto scylla, or commit to the skinny gap of charybdis.
This whole thing gives me anxiety.
It’s so weird looking back at it when I first started watching this channel when it started on the back deck in Florida
so about the spike pit of jagged logs... is that gonna just stay there....?
banana trail
song?
Ride your damn bike
Damn 5 months since you rode your bike? Wow
Videos like these being shame to my crappy little plywood jumps I built in my backyard 😅
Anyone else notice that when Seth went on the “B” line his back tire cut the corner and was not supported?  Could’ve been disastrous at slower speeds. Glad it worked out.
I recently got my first mtb at 28. I've been freestyle bmx riding my whole life still do, and always had a love for anything cycle related. Been following you for years and this channel and berm peak expeess has been the best help and inspiration to find what I want to start with!
You should set a trap where plastic snakes fall from above  if someone falls off. Or more simply throw some plastic snakes in there and hope someone gets scared if they fall in. Probably funny unless someone actually gets hurt though....
If I lived anywhere near there…❤❤❤
God i miss biking so much even tho its been like 5 days they feel like hell
i haven't been on YouTube in a little while, but I've watched your channel since 2018. Love that you're still pumping out videos. As always great content.
Adding chicken wire to the planks gives grip when it's wet
I bet so many people would have Volunteered to help. But good job 👍
looks  fun to build
He built a death trap.
Seth, start using rubber wrap on the logs before screwing the wood planks to it. It is what people use to wrap joists before putting decking on them. Should make the logs last much longer
So sad
Hey Seth, small tip, for splitting wood it's better to use metal wedges, plastic wedges only for felling trees
I like your innovation. Also man that is a dusty job, but a respirator or dust mask is a good idea. I know they are uncompromising to wear and hot.
I have been watching this channel from around 2018, before the first Berm Creek video, but then around 2020-2021 I stopped watching for some reason and I unsubscribed. Now I'm back and I'm bingewatching all the progress made during these 2 years. Glad to be back and see the amazing progress
Some gorgeous shots of you working on the line here, really appreciated it.
Oscar running behind you is the cutest thing ever ❤
9:13 I hate it when that happens... and of course I watch it for a few more seconds and that was on purpose.
Great to see you back on the bike after the injury . And thanks for sharing all the hard work, inspiring!
You should put a big wooden sculpture of a snake in the middle there! Great video 😂 🔥
5:33 That alone makes me want to buy a DeWalt. Very cool that they are selling replacement parts and have a design that can actually be repaired. A lot of other companies could learn a lot from that!
Why do you use torx screws?
Hey Seth, I want to give you my props for maintaining your trail like a good trail manager should.   I'm from Quebec, Canada, and a lot of our free trails are a poorly maintained, hodgepodge of hastily built jumps, bridges and berms that were thrown together by people decades ago a simply left to rot. I don't know how many times I have fallen into a ditch or bit into a wooden lip because the wood had rotten away to loam and humice.   Every time I would blindly attack a new run, I would eat it hard and limp away absolutely embarrassed by my lack of forethought and inspections, angry at the original builders for letting it get so bad and devastated that I broke yet another bone or bike part.  What I'm trying to say is that your efforts are greatly appreciated. They save face, bones, egos, and bank accounts. Thanks for being awesome!
The algorithm brought me here.  So happy it did. Killer content! Well done!
Seth you should look into using concrete deck blocks with the metal bracket in them. This way you have a block that’s easy to replace if the metal rusts out (they sell them at Lowe’s and stuff) and you can just pull the screws out of the bracket, to replace the post which is now completely out of the dirt, just on the off chance that it starts to go bad
Ur vids r so cool
I love ur vids
OMG I THOUGHT YOU TOOK A BREAK ON POSTING, i can’t believe youtube just stopped showing me videos from basically my favorite channel!! i guess i have some to catch up on a few weeks of vids! keep up the great content
I love those dewalt 40v chainsaws, I used to use one all the time when I worked for a company that built log homes. I would use it to cope out the joints between logs and it was just perfect
5:48 ok that looks so easy..I spent hours taking off bark without metal tools, and it so hard to keep the bark intact. I used to use patches of bark for rainproof roof in the "forest" over here. I'm pretty sure when the shelter is done, I'm going to work on the trail stuff here, especially when I have a decent bike. Will have to get super creative without electric tools, just some natural rope, a small foldable saw (takes 2 hrs to saw through 10cm of wood)..kinda like I'm Amish..but I'm not PS: wouldn't even dare to ride that snakerun right now, loving the video though
If you watched captainsparklez trial and relate that to this, then interact with this comment
Im new to the channel and i wish so badly i could do this trail it ñooks super fun
Hey Seth og viewer here… like 4900 manuals at the apartment viewer. Just wanna say how much I missed your vids and im so glad that your still up to the same old shinanigans as always. Much love man
i need this guy
you should make a c line
I love your creativeness and for someone who isn’t a carpenter your wood working skills are pretty good a little rough not like trim work but for a mountain biker there really good I learnt a lot of skaters and bikers actually have great woodworkers among them with my woodworking skills I would love to have half of your creativity
4 inch piece of wood and four inch screw counter sink the screw 2 inches most of those screws your using even have a little sawtooth feature built onto the back side of the heads to counter sink themselves a half inch or so but anymore than that you need to drill the wood to avoid splitting hillman brand screws exspecially have the sawtooth head a great self tapping end and an accelerated thread at the top to help pull stuff together tight the real strength if a fastner is not the shear strength of the screw or nail itself but the friction resulting from it drawing the two materials together which a great reason to always tap a nail on more time and even hit gun nails once or twice to draw the materials together  Just a bit of knowledge from a carpenter it’s tough to get good screws over 4 inches long much less at any kind of price that makes buying a couple pounds of them plausible
in the go pro the jump doesn't seem so bad, but when the angle changes, HOT DIGGITY DAWG
You need a nail gun would make it so much quicker
Seth is going to look like a body builder doing more features, who needs a gym when you have mountain biking
12:11 lmaoooo, "go stupid" meme reference
I love Oscar just sprinting after you as fast as he can 😂
2019...... Has it really been that long? Well time flies when your having fun!
Why does it sound so much like a velociraptor at 8:23?
i have never done any kind of mountain biking, but ive watched through almost all your videos in the past 3 weeks lol. thanks for the motivation to get out and just have some fun! I am now looking into my own bike to get myself started on some local trails! Appreciate you man!
I remember watching the snake pit video in 2019 and it feels like yesterday
hey Seith, can you make a video on how to make a ramp
This is what appeals to the male fantasy
I would go outside to ride my bike but I would rather sit inside watching you do it. Thanks Seth.
I wish I was as much of a handy man as Seth. Dude makes stuff look easy
You should react to your first ever YouTube video the one about installing a dropper post back in 2015
2:30  coming from banana boat is log car
u haven't uploaded in a whilee
Can you shoutout my new yt it’s name is bikes and random stuff
Can you shoutout my new yt it’s name is bikes and random stuff
its dewalt or nothing seth
seth i really like your channel i follow u since that video when u put 1000 led light on fat bmx...what do you think about starting a series when we send you our bike pictures and u comment about them suggest what should we upgrade or change that would be really awesome...Keep working hard dude
Love these build videos.
Hey, could you do a new starter mountain bike video again because the last ine i saw was 4 years ago. Would be great if this would be possible.
Yo, what’s a good 27.5 hard tail frame that’s small.
My biking life: 2 months ago: learn how to ride a bike in 6 hours 10 days later: get my brothers old bike worth 20$ in local currency and learn how to stand up on a bike 5 days later: learn how to take up front wheel 1 day later: learn a magic thing i didnt know about: preloading the sus 10 days later: ride off a 30m (98ft) hill and shit myself absolutely for the next 20 days i just practice preloading and taking up the wheel (smooth) i start learning how to endo still havent fallen down a single time on my own bike because my balance so good omg im buying a bike on facebook marketplace. Problem? My budget is *170$ in local* i hope i find something decent bc my dad owns a small portion of a forest and he let me build some small trails and features to learn and im planning to hit my first green trail in a month or less depending when i get my first real bike wish me luck
Dude awesome! I love your videos! Do you have any site where I can learn about bike mechanics and stuff? Thanks!
Day 1 of asking  How about build a bike out of those bike parts left from your past bike rebuild episode that would be entertaining🚴
When you gonna post more often bro? Been waiting for weeks for some new content
BCpov and Berm Peak need to make some trails together
Have you ever thought of getting an REI Co-op?
Hey how do you change a bike to a 1 speed in the front of the bike
What is the best full suspension mountain bike for the price?
Can you help me with something? The thing is that always when i pedal sometimes the “front” gear kinda like “falls” down to the first gear while i have it in second gear… how do i fix that? Hope you understood👍🏻🚵🏼‍♂️
OMG I'm so envious of your rockless soil that makes it so easy to dig those holes! Here in New England we hit a big rock with every shovel in the ground. Anyway great job!
What’s better suspension coil or air also is the Carrera furnace 2 a good bike
Do you still have your box race bmx bike?
Really exited for the future. Expecting nice features to be added. Video idea: "Reviewing bike speedometer apps" Hope this helps.
Hey Seth you should try out the new morsochi air shock
Can you please use Fuji nevada bike and making rap on it
Hey Berm peak I was wondering if you wanted to do another bike flip I have the perfect bike for you at the track 820 try making it look flashy never really worked out has some problems but I’m sure you can fix it would you be interested in getting it for me for 50 bucks
I was waiting for someone to jump into the B line
I hope people get an appreciation of how many hours go into building trail features they cross in 2 seconds.
Little Oscar running under obstacles really made my day ❤️😆😁
You can't hit it backwards now XD
Seth is playing minecraft irl respect for your hard work buddy love from india
I found your channel back at 2019, and u made me so in love with bikes. I'm currently a student in a graphic designer university and I am so inpatient to finish my uni to buy a nice a bike !
sad to see such an iconic feature go 😪😪😥😥
Is it diamondbacks sinker a good beginner bike
Hey Seth, can you make a video about using brakes, and the difference between them. I'm new to mountain biking and I'm scared to use my front brake.
Something different but kinda the same would be filling your tires with ~gallon of sealant and seeing what happens when tearing a sidewall. They say it works on  6 mm punctures, but that’s never worked for me.
Hey Seth love the videos I love Mountain biking and hope you see this
Berm park is so good
Yo Seth just a quick question ik you probably won’t reply but I am looking to upgrade my fork I want something with 130 mil travel and is not tapered and an air fork aswell as fits 27.5 inch wheels just wondering if you have any recommendations?
hi, do you guys think my olympia cobra 29 is a good mtb?
Love these videos 👍
What is him debarking planks so satisfying
You should ride teeter totter more
Is it actually good to put grease on every metal to metal surface
Dude, I’ve been watching your videos for years and some how I’m not subscribed! Fixed the injustice and still loving the videos!
Most wood rots from the outside. There is such a thing as heart rot. However I guess heart rot is in living trees.
i have a bunch of bikes i’m willing to give you for more content message me for more info im from portland oregon if you’re interested!!
he actually lives the life i dream of
Did you say this to your wife when you met her? 0:58
Berm peak is a bucket list place ill probably never get to see, Aslo need to have Kyle back so he can ride it backwards
The entrance to the B line is not an afterthought it’s a death sentence
Any tips for getting motorcycle chain lube off of a mountain bike cassette?  I've made mistakes...
A tool sponsorship would come in handy Seth.
A quick helper for keeping the posts in good condition down here on the farm in Australia we use old Diesel engine oil as a paint/stain to help protect the posts
Sad to see it go. Happy to see you building features again.
Pretty awesome!  Definitely more sketchy but it might also encourage more people to jump because it almost doesn't look is bad...  Lol!  Just don't chicken out!!!
I would have just bought a new one but since they don’t make it anymore
No, snake pit:( Good job on the new snake pit
ngl seths bike hacks gone downhill
You come here for the MTB content.  I come here for the lumberjack content.  We are not the same.
when you put wooden poles in the ground the part that goes into the ground cover it whit   middle of cut bottles and when it heats up it will shrink and will not rot,,,. Love videos 💪❤️👋👍👏🙏
How to move on from scratches from bike crashed like that?
My whole class watches you!😎 Loves from Australia ❤️
That looks freakin terrifying lol
Just watched the first video you’ve ever posted, crazy how far you’ve come.
You need some really serious psychiatric care.
About the sawmill piece, I’d argue the only better tool for trail building is a shovel
This man cures my depression XD
Can i have a bike?
I’m looking forward to one day ride berm park
Wow it was 2019 that trail was built, what a journey 👏
Not even 1.5 minutes in and there is already an ad. Have some standards.
Will you be my handy dad
That kevin laugh though its contiguous
Can we rename this to "Sketch Pit Skinny"?
5:45 that sticker!! 👀👀👀
You are an inspiration, not su much for the mtn bike content for me but for how handy you are and how you approach your projects. Someday I hope to have such cool workshop as yours.
Would treating the wood be cost efficient in the long run... waterproofing paint or spray and the likes but I dunno, it might make it too slick to ride on and then again knowing how detailed Seth is... you probably would have done it if it was doable... just my 2 cents... Snakepit 2.0 looks hella sketchy!!! Awesomeness!
It would be so dope to see you get into moto...
“Jank” is NOT the word for this. I think “doom” works much better!
I wish I could ride I have holes in both of my tires and don’t have the money to fix them
Awesome Vid as usual!! Does it ever stop raining on your planet!
Three words to complete this feature. Fake Rubber Snakes
Nice!
Now you just did it in the dark in old incarnation now have to do the new in the dark ;)
Where do you sell your bikes, because im tryna find that website so I can get a good bike.
Have you ever tried spraying the logs with a clear coat or something to protect them
2.5 million subscribers and Seth’s still saving the screws to reuse them.  This cheap Carpenter approves
Man id come work for u anyday
Why don’t you make a „C-Line“ where you don’t need to go over the hump and just have to ride a skinny
When are you using the enduro barrow again😊
The B line actually looks more sketch then the A line on this now :)  Enjoyed the vid!
@dewalt get this man some new stuff.
Helo i just learned to bike last week! Any tips?
This video makes me so sad it is my favorite feature at berm peak
Hey I was wondering is you or any viewers could check out my edit and rate it 1-10. Thank you everyone!!!
0:58 That's what she said
Incredibly on brand that Seth made it even gnarlier than before, hahahaa
Is that a new bike it looks different
Welcome to berm peak where we build our own features and like everything a lot more sketchy than before
Dirt rots wood that is not smart
the ol' Bultooth chaps :D
When that video came out it was such a great idea and a great feature, I remember it like yesterday!
this guy is the living definition of do it yourself
Petition to put snakes in the Snake Pit 🙋‍♂️
Amazing ✊🤙👍👊
freaking love Oscar haha little dog trail running after his dad haha
i rode one skinny line never again
Please make a 1000$ bike build video
5:11 you should made that a full vids on  berm peak express lol or like a tool inspection
the jazz was perfect for the motor fix, I don't understand either.
Have you thought about using the Japanese wood burning technique (Shou sugi ban) to preserve all this work you are doing?  Char the wood and slap some linseed oil on it and it'll keep the bugs and weather away for a long time.
I can say I really like subtitles in your videos.. I watched them all although Im not MTBiker, but it helped with my English verry mutch.. When I hear a word I dont know, I turn them on and then Im able to learn what that means.. Here in Czech republic, my english asked me how Im so good at english when a lot of people in my class cant do basic stuff sometines.. I told her it was from these YouTube videos and she looked shocket that is possible.. Well she is oldschool and basicly her younger times were in Communist Czechoslovakia so that explains it.. So verry much thank you for having them.. Even if I dont MTBike Im quite interested in it becouse I like bicycles and some of the things you say are in my Language verry diffrent.. Great video man keep them up 😁
rip old sp
For the Alaskan mill couldn't you change the gas chain saw for an electric one?
Bro nice job!
Man, I have been watch your video's for  a few days now.  I got to ask, what breed is your dog?
Doesn't look like the snakepit will be ridden backwards again anytime soon...even the B-line looks sketchy
Did you get a new mic the Audio sounds different bud really good
Nice job Seth very cool build
Doggo doggo is living in heaven.
I am glad to see Seth using Torx screws. I cringe and die every time on the inside when i see people do anything without torx screws. The distinct sound of a philips head screw or philips screw bit being destroyed is horrible.
hi berm can you do a Q and A about 26er being dead   thanks
This seems like a very fun project!
Are you still doing video on project horse ?
I m buying my first full sus what do you think i shold buy under 2000
Your making your own north shore at this point
I’m born and raised in the north shore home on mtb and skinnies glad to see your bring some shore flavour to berm peak love to see it keep it up
I must admit, I was hesitant to say goodbye to the original snake pit, just as I was hesitant to say goodbye to the drop on berm creek, or the sketchiest wallride to ever exist. But you continue to shred, and kill it! I guess I should know by now that everything will become a little bit different, but kind of the same.
I wish I could get a mountain bike but I can’t afford one 😭
Watching Seth work on these projects brings me back to the old “This Old House” days with Bob Vila; there is something about starting and finishing a project with tools and grit—it feeds a man’s soul.
He’s about to have a skinny with a loop in it soon
No way that was build in 2019…where did the years go?🥹😭😭
Admit it, you did this because Kyle was able to ride this feature backwards! 🤣
Is it as sketchy as you're talking it up to be Seth lol.  Gap looks tiny, but what do I know lol
That's sick!
replacing a motor in an electric chainsaw really seams like it would eliminate any advantages it brings
How many remakes has this had?
holy crap snake pit was 2019...thats insane i remember seeing this whole line come together, looking forward to it each week
Alex has to go back to clear that
please help me i have a mongoose mountain bike please send me a mountain bike please
Nice tips shown on the project, thanks
im sure someone may have mentioned this before but if they didn't you'll find using the pulling side of the chain rather than the pushing chain when milling is much less physical.
Cmon, we all know you could make that jump onto b-line
amazing job! and done all by one man only.
Is it possible to make a bermed skinny corner? would love to see one.
Please get some safety glasses 🥽.
The wood landing could be a tad wider and a case pad would be safer.
New challenge: exit the hump to the right early and jump onto to the B-line.
I watched this video with no intention of going here.
New sub liked 👍❤️🙏😀
这才是生活，外国人的世界真好玩.
Just a tip seth, get a flame thrower and burn the end of your posts from bottom to top about a foot up off the ground. This drastically increases the life of the post.
Amazing video! :-) cant wait to see a new hardtail video :D
Now that looks alot faster coming off of a line at snake pit. Does that mean you should retest the road gap
Just brilliant! Talent personified
Lovely to see some good old fashioned Berm Peak building, it's been a while!
If u like this comment you will get good luck
Nice
And Alex had getting the first snake pit hard enough
When are you going to take the bmx race bike to the track like U said 4 years ago
5:52 was extremely satisfying
Cooool
Idk how to ride a bike, but I would run across it
Holy shit that’s way more scary lol 😂
You Seth are a animal with a sadistic monster brain lol 😂 I’m already imagining everyone’s reaction
if you dont mind how tall are you?
I’ll pass!  If it was me I’d at least clear all the old logs and rocks first.  That right turn looked more sketchy than the gap though.
Seth you should call it the snake skin. The old feature shed its skin and started fresh, but it’s still the same old snake
its soo clunky and sooo bad
I clicked on this hoping it was actually about snakes lol
all can think when ever you are hand post hole digging, using the auger, hammering posts-wow it’s a good thing you don’t live in Colorado ♠️🚫🪨🪨🪨😂🪨🪨🪨🪨 so many rocks here!!
Time is short   To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
I don't trail bike, I barely even ride my hybrid bike around the city... I never miss an episode. I love everything on this channel
Hey seth how about for your next video you put a back gear shifter, gear shifters on th handle bars and mtb brakes love your vids
I know you are most likely not reading this, but I suggest it would be an awesome idea to make a suspension bridge jump, there is a ramp and then you land on a suspension bridge, then you jump off that and land.
Good for you Seth, keepin yourself fit. I’m sure you’ll thank yourself for that in the future
You should build a little lean for the gator but its also a feature like i triangle that you can ride over but also park the gator under it
straight outta riders republic! sick dude
You should ride banana cannon I really wanna see it
It would be so cool if the documentary was on Netflix
To drive the stakes you can use the bucket of the digger and push down or fit it
I did my first skinny  line at a trail acentre. dammn that's scary
Take the BMX out and do one of your trails on it!!!! Or just some BMX content.
11:51 OUCH, that backwheel looks like it's in pain once it hits that ramp. Pretty cool video, seeing a part actually being built.
In good old Seth fashion, the B line looks harder than the main line but the main line look more mentally difficult
We need another bike check, last one was 4 years ago
PLEASE wear some protection while using a chainsaw, otherwise nice vid
finally a building video!!!!!!! love the other ones but these are the best
Idk why watching tiny dude strugel doing trail building in the rain is oddly satisfaing 😂❤️
Hey Seth, just a tiny bit concerned about the lack of chainsawing pants 🙂 I had an accident where i slipped and hit my knee with the chainsaw, could have saved myself that dag and made it with no cuts in my kneecap if I wore sawpants👍😄 Keep up the great work tho.
noooo i really liked the snake gap
I think the old logs need to be packed back around it to complete the look
The b line seems more difficult.😂
Please get some chainsaw chaps and safety boots when using a chainsaw, they will save your life.
Yo the old music is back
Do it backwards haha Seth do it just do it
How many centipedes did you find? Lol
cool
Build vids? YES! Best content.
Snake pit 2.0 looks very promising 😎
My God, How can You Mountain Bikers do so well on these skinnies like you won't die on this, well I'm a Cross Country biker so I Don't do this types of skinnies and that much Jumps
are you going to back fill the existing cut logs back in place to give it that snake pit feel again?
Seth is gonna stark a side YouTube channel of him becoming a carpenter
U should make a trail for the budget rider with mingle and cheap tools
Seth as a test pilot :D You have to ride it first when you have built it.
Seth really knows how to do everything, I had no idea he was able to solder and heat shrink.
This man got so many skills!
You and Beau Miles should chat. Your love of wood and what it can do is on par with each other.
YEA boi
do you bother drilling plot holes and countersinking
These videos are always the best. Fantastic work Seth!
Was there always a sticker from backyard trail builds on the landing? Cool to see this :)
tou jumping the snakepit gap 100% needs to be a tshirt or a poster or something !
ЖЖ х
WOOho, did I see a Trailblazer glinting in the sun??
The feature itself now looks like a snake😂
Finally it’s been done
Not what I was expecting next but this was sick. Love Snake Pit. One of my favorite parts of Berm Peak.
Congrats to switching to Sony! 100x better in every way in my opinion
Can we just take a moment to appreciate the slow-mo side shot of the jump? Really cinematic
What with the Backyard trail build sticker on the landing
So awesome - loved it!
Kudos on the DIY chainsaw repair! That was lovely.  (Tool manufacturers: "what?! Serialize and lockdown ALL the things!")
Literally what a psychopath
To help with the cedar cracking, if you blunt the tip of the screw it should prevent cracking. Whack it with your hammer or hammer it into something hard and you should be gravy.
Yowzers, that's intense!
Repent to Jesus Christ  “Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.” ‭‭1 Peter‬ ‭5:6‬ ‭NIV‬‬ J
i know this is random, but do you own a motorcycle or dirt bike?
Project Horse Berm
The problem with sketchy features is always the first time, and quite frankly there are no outs with this design. You've raised it off the ground, made the B-Line, which was supposed to be the safe way out, almost harder to take than the actual feature, both of which are blind. Someones bound to get hurt on this thing.
"Trees rot from the outside" Continues to not address this via treatment like oils, varnish or paint. Same thing is going to happen again in a year's time dude!
That battery powered saw makes it all easy and tidy
love your channel, man. i appreciate all the hard work that you put into this. probably not as much as you do, though. just wanna spread love and positivity.
damn it feels like just yesterday...
when are we going to see you hit  the jump on thum bucket I can't be the only one waiting for that one 🎉😂😢
Rip snake pit   Long live snake pit 2
It's almost 2years I have been watching your videos i started watching your videos from 2020. You make good content and you are improving day by day. I have watched all the videos where you turn a normal junky bike into hardtail MTb. I got to know a lot about MTb by you. I wish I could afford a MTb seeing my friends and my neighbor's kid riding and having fun but I can't, I have a dream of getting a MTb that you converted and I was about to get scammed once from a guy with your channel name and I got so excited I was about to do whatever he says but I got to know it was a scam. I really want a MTb with your sign and modifications on it but I don't have money. I think it will always be a dream. You are my motivation and inspiration keep growing Seith. I feel guilty but I can ask if you can gift me a MTb even if it's cheap. If no then it's okay you will always be best
Awesome 😎👌🏻
That Stihl 462 saw🥵
If you want really good custom timber you should look into investing in a turbosawmill
MADE IT ONTO TRENDING!!! CONGRATS SETH!!!
12:12 that was so wholesome to hold seths dog and let him run only after he cleared the jump
Your forgetting to birds mouth your rafters good sir. This may bite you in the gonads one day
Seth good to see you enjoying the new Mtb.  Signed DB,
Seth goes scary...AGAIN!
The one footer was absolutely insane
Pro rider clears snake pit in reverse Seth: I’m going to make it scarier
new build montage music??!?! That sh!ts groovy
The music choices throughout your vids are highly underrated, Seth.
Meanwhile somewhere in America Mr Singletrack sampler is shaking his head 😂😂😂
Should burn the wood so it lasts longer
wooo! thanks for making my wednesday a lil more sketchy :)
I've missed these videos 🤌
2019?!!?!!?!?!? Wtf man, I swear yall just moved there.
Thanks for the quality entertainment, you build in the rain is serious dedication, I cringe to think of you camera equipment out in the rain.
A reminder to y'all to leave a like
Seth is the King of sketchy
Top 25 on trending! Good job Seth!
Felt like a classic berm peak video 💪
That guy has come here
13:08 the failed second highfive ahah😄
looks like a wishbone 👍🏻
I cant imagine the amount of work it took to do all this, on top of placing the cameras all the time. nice job
Timber locks to the rescue!
All the vids are good, but the “Seth builds some sketch” theme music has been missed. Thanks for bringing it back.
this is really cool, but it does seem as though the tree isnt as much of a challenge because its not within your flight path unless you land short, or height isn't as much of a challenge
Sketch pit, not snake pit.
What an amazing journey from being a bike hooligan in an apartment to taking down trees and running your own bike park. Fantastic!
Hey Seth, you should show us and go over all of your bikes in your collection That’d be awesome man thanks 👍
Congrats on 2.4 mil subs
I’m from the Southwest and I have a question: what the heck is rain?
YouTube recommended me the snake pit build video during the middle of covid and I’ve been watching ever since. A while later, just over a year ago, I finally purchased a bike and started riding again. I’ve put over 500miles on it since - still can’t hit anything near as sketchy as snake pit, but maybe someday. Thanks for introducing me to this sport Seth, and it’s very cool to see the revitalization of this Berm Peak classic!
Watching this now and seeing it #27 on Trending. Keep up the hard/good work!
hi
Snake pit 2.0 makes me excited for what 3.0 will hold when the B-line degrades too much. Also after seeing Seth throw that one-footer, i wanna see someone tabletop it. Even if its a baby one itll still be cool
maybe you should draw a snake on the lip
It would be cool to make a skinny on the log your jumping on snake pit
Loved the jazz
Saw your article in Mountain Flyer magazine, very good !  Thanks
Hey Seth, been watching some old videos recently and have been wondering what happened to Bosco? The dog you brought jeeping
Right on! That looks sick, dude! You've given me so many ideas to try and make a trail around my buddy's camp 🏕
Seth needs to stop lying. He like being a lumberjack.
You are crafty as hell my man! Keep goin! 💪🏼
8:14 when you eat too much carb n not enough fibre
i feel like seth found the one place where it rains every day lol
Just absolutely drenched at 8:00 proof (not like we needed any more) that it's hard work that makes these projects special
I'm fearing for my life... and I'm just watching this video... you, sir... are mental! xD
So glad to see a new build
That looks like the most horrifyingly horrible feature I have ever seen. (In the best way possible) You have to get some people trying to ride this!
Should of called it the Jank plank
6:22 oh wow that looks incredibly sketchy
County Supervisor Admires the Courage of Falun Gong Practitioners Mr. Donald W. Weaver, sponsor of the resolution, was very touched after learning about forced organ harvesting in China. He said it breaks his heart just hearing about it. He called forced organ harvesting evil and genocidal.   Mr. Donald W. Weaver meeting with local Falun Gong practitioners  Mr. Weaver met with Falun Gong practitioner Ms. Chi Lihua and heard her personal experience of being persecuted while in China. He said he admires the courage of Falun Gong practitioners in resisting the persecution.  Ms. Chi and her husband Mr. Xu Dawei were arrested for making materials to raise awareness of the persecution of Falun Gong. Mr. Xu was sentenced to eight years in prison and was brutally tortured. He died 13 days after he was released from prison. Within 100 days of Mr. Xu’s passing, Ms. Chi lost her parents and older brother. Ms. Chi herself was sent to prison four times for her faith in Falun Gong and barely survived the ordeal.   Ms. Chi and her daughter holding pictures of her late husband at a candlelight vigil in Washington, D.C. on July 16, 2021.  Mr. Weaver told Ms. Chi that Americans need to know the truth about the persecution and understand the evil of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He said he admires the courage of Falun Gong practitioners in China and elsewhere for stepping out and telling people about the truth. He called them sparks of hope and encourages practitioners to continue their effort and not to give up.  Mr. Weaver believes that the most important thing for practitioners to do outside China is to expose the persecution and the CCP’s evil deeds in order to end the persecution. He believes every local government should pass a resolution like Fluvanna County has.  Finally Mr. Weaver said he very much agrees with Falun Gong’s principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Forbearance, and hopes more people can follow these principles in their lives.
So I wonder who will be the first be person to gap from the start of snake pit to the b line because it looks possible but super sketchy.
It seems as Seth was offended when his friend rode it backwards, so he made so that wasn’t possible.😂😂
Can we please talk about how this whole video basically was just one big showoff move on how amazing Seth's woodwork has become? You can really see the experience he got through the past few years of running this channel.
The way you built the skinny it is almost like you are encouraged to take the jump rather than the B line.
Yessss the jank is backkk
I love your vids Seth you got me into bike riding
this is probably sketchy and maybe not even possible but has anyone tire tapped the tree on the gap?
sad to see the old one go but great feature man!
That moment when Trending Page.
a roller wood be O.P.
Couldn't be more stoked to see more building on Berm Peak. The Series is what got me to subscribe in the first place so please, more building!
What editing application do you recommend for a beginner? Preferably free
Thank you so much seth. I just got sick and happy to know theres something to rebinge on
Gap from the first roller to the b line, you wouldn’t get hurt at all
Damn I was planning a roadtrip to Berm Park this week but I just tested positive for covid :/
In the future, if you change it again, you should make the first part a skinny up to a teeter totter and the teeter totter would be the down part of the a frame.
Seth....That is funny. Everytime I undo a project, I save the screws.
That looks terrifying.
nice
Food for algorithm ;-)
@seth please invite sam pilgrim that’s would be so nice
It is so sad to see an old feature go, but it is great to have something new 😁
I love how Oscar goes bombing down the trail behind Seth.
You should rename it to the worm pit lol
Finally building videos !!!!!
Been looking forward to build videos and god this was brilliant - absolutely loved it! I almost think the b line is sketchier in a way!😂
Seth´s builds are like: "Well we didn´t die on the last one. Sooo let´s try again !"
I verbally cannot explain how happy I am seeing these style building videos back :)
I wouldn't put this in the video, but you could always paint it with used motor oil.  It absorbs completely, doesn't stain after dry, and will keep it from rotting for a long long time.
Every week is like a new adventure with Seth
Would love u to jump on to the b skinny
I’m cringing at how scary this jump is more than I did the first time
Love the upgrade !
Does Mrs Seth know what kind of awesomeness she is married to? 😁 Great job Seth! 👏
seth building wooden features is the best seth
That´s just a piece of art! Thanks for all your inspired videos!
Video Idea: Oscar the kind of trail DOG😂
nicee man
Yesss so psyched to see y’all building stuff again
Can’t believe this legendary section has had its day, but all those that burn bright die at some point. See out sun in 5 billion years for details 🤣
I mean,just modifing the curent features to be sketchier would make for a great series,hope this continues,up next,the pain frame
Y'all cray cray
madness, genius and sketchiness in equal measure, awesome building and riding skills
So happy to see you build again! But as a health and safety advisor I'm begging you, please wear some protective pants when you're using a chainsaw. I've seen way to many people get seriously hurt by a chainsaw kicking back or slipping while using it, wouldn't want to see you lose a leg!
I'm so inspired by you could you do a vidieo on a bambo part
Have you considered cross hatching with your chainsaw to improve traction?
Nice video! Brings back the old nostalgic pre-Berm peak style videos you used to make. And the classic seth music at 8:49 lol
He makes it look easy again
I love that you're channeling "Other Seth" with the construction style and technique.
Man when you pulled the slow mo one footer my jaw hit the floor! So rad.  Seth I have an idea for your channel, what's the best way to contact you?
12:42 i make the same face when i think im about to crash😂
seth , my man, you have that little excavator, make it easier on yourself,use the excavator to drive those post in to the ground
I wonder how long it’s gonna take for someone to  use the start as a lip and jump onto the b line😭
Seth is basically a guy who can do everything.Fixing everything, changing motors, printing stickers and knowing everything about tree wood and dirt
Seth, you've lost your mind. That thing is insane :D
"and we're going to make the whole thing scarier" so glad to see the king of sketch back to building
Makes me wonder how much that replacement motor cost
See how your sawdust coming out of the chain saw is dust? It’s time for a new chain. Your nice powerful saw should be spitting big chunks not dust
I've been following your channel from the early days keep up with all the content love the variety great to see you building back on your place 😀
Ahhh yes. Back to the Peak time. Love your content. Your OG backyard trail was the inspiration to kick off my own build.
So happy this is like a OG build
Can't wait to watch this!
In the video you can she a Sticker from Backyard Trailbuilding
Not a mountain bike guy just enjoy the videos, have you thought about putting plastic over the trees then put the planks over it so they don't rot as fast?
great stuf, as always:)
Awsome
This does look dangerous
Damn, his daughter will get the sickest treehouse in all of america when she gets older.
sketchy
Nice build but way to thin and skinny was this sponsored by local hospital?
I can confidently say this is my favorite YouTube channel, regardless of the channel topic. Keep up the good work!
If you want to make it even sketchier you can buy a few snakes and release 'em... It remedies the "no snakes at the snake pit" problem and gives you even more of an incentive not to fall.
Seth could you coat the wood in boiled linseed oil every season to preserve it naturally?
It’s not Berm peak if it isn’t sketchy.
I love your videos and what helmet do you have?
Wow that look so scary! I was thinking of building my own snake pit, now there's no way it will measure up! looks like so much fun though
You make me happy with your videos <3
RIP OG Snake Pit. 2019 - 2022
I was literally looking up which brand of power tools to go with this morning and this video answered that question. After watching your tools continue to work after that rain and knowing all of the screws you've had to drill in and out I'm pretty sold on Dewalt.
I saw the thumbnail and thought, “oh god what is that.”
best video for a long time! Awesome, love the storytelling! and its jazz again with Seth, like in the old days
you need to make like a snake statue or something snake related to call it snake pit
I would love to see skills with phil do this because he just LOVES skinnys
So sick
Keeping the “berd” wheels I see 👌🏽
😂 had the drill on reverse I do that a lot building ramps and keep saying why isn’t it working!
Good video like always man love to try the ur park one day ! If u let me just need a mtb think a 27inch BMX type can do what mtb do?
Can u do a video where u ride all of ur trails. Would love to see them all.
You forgot the line I usually choose which is headfirst in to the logs.
Poor drill
More of this!!!
Pls call the next jump.. Wiggi wiggi bunga bunga?
Obviously good building/riding, but I was most impressed by the motor swap in the chainsaw haha
I really dig your starwars transitions
Kyle's going to have to come back and do this one backwards too!
Seth's logic: "We have this sketchy skinny we need to rebuild... Let's make it more sketchy!" 🤣
UPLOAD! My day is made!
Didn't that farm/ranch 20" dewalt come out this summer?
Good quality screws
RIP old snake pit and hello and welcome to the new snake pit, love the content keep it up Seth been a subscriber since forever!!
you are crazy!
How are you dealing with theses weeks of rain we’ve been getting in avl?
The blind hump then transition to the b-line is sketch lol
It's always fun playing lumberjack
man your vids are so satisfaying to watch i just came from school and im just chilling right now
I'd like to see someone try the jump, but tap the front tire on the tree mid-jump!
8:49 whoop there it is!  🎶 Milage
Seth just found out that it could be ridden backwards and he wasn't having it!
Hey Seth,   I have a pretty important message that I direct messaged you on Instagram. It is about cheap suspension forks that you have used.
Every time Seth builds something new I just shake my head for 2 reasons.  1. I don't have the nuts to ride it and 2. I also don't have the skill to ride it!!  I can't even imagine what that stuff looks like in real life!!
Gnarly
Built in 2019 what the hell happend to all the time
Can someone make skinny made out of dirt
Seth love your videos keep doin this.
Have the other Seth, Backyard Trail Builds, come build something else when he has time.
Love the new feature
I really don't under why you'd build this, idk I'd like to see some dirt jumps or something with air time.  It's sketchy and I get that, it's cool to look at I guess.  But it's boring...
A landing in the shape of a brachistochrone curve be a cool experiment to try out!
0:58 Me to the ladies
Trail building and jazz? I love it!
woooo! been waiting for this for a long time
Maybe look at getting a Auger attachment for the mini Ex! Saves your back for sure :)
Man this old berm peak vibe video is what I needed
Oscar is TOTALLY a trail dog! I’d love to see a video about that…
Sick!!
I’m sorry WHAT 👍
Seth: "the old line terrified good riders...   Time to sketch it up a bit."
I feel like I’ve grown up with Seth, I remember waiting for a video every week just to watch him dig up his back yard with shovels. he’s come such a long way, makes me feel like a proud dad
While I'm a fix everything I have type of guy, I probably would have bought a new chainsaw.  By the time my tools' motors are wearing out, the rest of the tool is to.  That said, I've never had a tool where the ecosystem is killed off.
How long until someone gaps to the B line 😬
I like a challenge, and I like riding cool features - But Effing-A Dude, that is a bit too sketchy for me and the majority of riders I know.  You have to leave some room for error, don't ya?
Please, stop!
With all that rotting wood, the snake pit is going to be the Brown Recluse pit
Will Kyle be doing it backwards ?
0:58 Seth just describing himself lol
Finally, snake pit gets a revamp!, could you revamp the mame frame? make it more... Dangerous
I don’t think anything is better than watching your videos in the morning
your videos inspired me to start mountain biking and I'm having a blast!  keep up the good work and thanks for being my inspiration
These videos are my favorite!
Seth Seth Seth, you are nuts! Can't wait to see what other creations you come up with this summer.
This was a cool build to witness. I appreciate the actual sweat that went into this creation. Well done with all the planning that went into the build as well as the B-line addition.
5:50 Why is stripping that bark off so satisfying?
Watching this video with my snake he approves
Next have a drone follow you through the whole trail system there.
🤯🥰
It seems the b line is tougher than the jump
Next step add rubber snakes to the bottom to fulfill its name
Thank you so much for being such a good channel I have been watching your channel for about two years now of course not with this account but you have inspired me to build my own mountain bike track in my backyard online channel❤️❤️❤️❤️
You could make them last longer with epoxy product or linseed oil up to you seth
All I can say is wow. Don't know if I'm more impressed with you riding skills or your carpentry skills. At this point I'm leaning toward carpentry.
Very sketchy and very dangerous. I like it!
Not sure if it's a new style or what but the music in this video really stood out to me, love it!
From your comment on the soil, it seems to me that it‘s more of a wormhole rather than a snake pit 🙃
Between having his own biking place a huge bike trail a YouTube channel and being a genuine at making machines he is crazy talented keep up the good work! Love the content
I loved this skinny so much.... It inspired me to ride and build skinnies
Seth is dying in this NC heat, this stuff is brutal
You should start a completely new line just for fun
It's always a good day when seth posts
Me: I want the north shore Mom: we have the north shore at home The north shore at home:
It's just built to not allow Kyle to boast about doing it backwards.
I mean, your in charge of a whole forest. Might want to dig a shallow pit so you can use that Alaskan mill at a better angle.
Amazing song choice
I see you are riding the new wheels are you testing them?
What dewalt saw did you use to cut that radius on the thick board?
I love watching all of your videos my favorites are flip bike and you building features.
really cool!
I think an excavator auger might be in line 😅
Videos keep on getting better and better
No one: Seth: I wonder how can i make this more sketchy?
hey seth you should do a collab with 'perkins builder brothers' they are on youtube and in north carolina, they are carpenters and i was watching them a lot lately, and the main guy rides a full suspension mountainbike and casually mentioned red bull rampage in one of the videos so he is one of us, they could elevate your trail building to the next level
Thank God building is back
Seeing all the equipment we've gathered over the years be used for this project is kind of cool
caught that lil backyard trail builds sticker!
He used the music!!
if you are in problems with the costruction of trail, i think that "backyard trail"  is the best person
If you have rotting trees like yours, get some star pickets or T posts I think you call them over there and run a chainsaw cut along both sides of the tree and place one side pf the star picket in the groove/cut and screw in a criss cross pater to secure, then you can use self tapping metal screws to secure you the cedar planks to the star pickets and BAM! Just like new again for less work and probably money
Kevin’s shirt is incredibly bright lol. Love this
Start my season hurtin but your video give me a good place to be .
You're a mad man Seth! I love it. Good bye snake pit, thanks for the memories, Hello snake pit 2.0, let's send it!
Hold up, You are definitely doing something different.........but the same
Bone breaker
I am sad to see the snake pit go
I love the build videos!
Seth has adapted the feature Seth and Seth built :)
Seth! Is Kevin gone forever?
put your shrink wrap on a set of needle noses, give it light heat, stretch to fit and then shrink it back down. love your content
I really like that you made a vid with wood and building something. Keep going with make these great vids.
Seth, I think you should do like a little memorial for that iconic feature. You could do on the second channel, I think it will be interesting
Seth your videos never fail to entertain me. Amazing videos
tfw you never got to ride og snake pit :(
Thanks seth
Yes finally a build video
Never in a million years would I hit that
That is crazy
Seth - you crank that background music all day in your earbuds, don’t you??
Well, that's different...
When are you going to hit the banana cannon
Is that a backyard trail builds sticker at 10:39?
We need to see Eric porter do a sick 1 foot tabletop on the new snake pit gap
That is freaky on video, i can't imagine how teriffing it will be in real life
Seth,are you still running the nodel spokes
You could make some small rock formations in the snake pit that would not only serve as snake housing, but also a crawler course.
So happy to see the builds coming back
this video came exactly when I needed it, and I'm always eager to see the weekly video from Berm Peak.  Keep up the good work Seth, love seeing all the cool stuff you do.
built in 2019?!?!?!?!?!
Sweet fancy Moses, that is sketchy. Well done.
Stooopid Pit?  :P
IDEA:  Seth, what do you think about doing a series similar to Jerry Seinfeld’s where he interviews special guests.  This would be such an easy and fun show to do as you ride with your guest on Berm Peak. I know you have guests, but a personal insight to the guests will be awesome!
Hi
Send flowers to widow....
Really happy to see you out doin trail stuff again. I bet it felt great to get away from being a dad for a bit to go play in the trails for a while. great video.
Seth your a smart guy I hope u considered if someone gets hurt on your property, see how fast things change when a lawsuit is involved
Rip snakepit hello snakepit2.0
I really like the new feel of this video I can't quite put my finger on it, but wow
seems only yesterday we were watching to build this. time flys!
Love this channel💪👍❤️
I love skinnies but this is extremely intimidating! Perfect🤘
i love when i get to wach you build stuff :) thanks for the great content keep up the great work thanks
I cannot tell you how happy I was to see a main channel video.    Made my day
Seth continue to attempt to kill one of his guest 😂😂😂
Good ole Seth ramping up berm peak's sketch factor by a couple of notches! Im lovin it!
I like the new version better, seems more challenging
We need to have a serious conversation about your b-lines…
I wouldn't even consider even riding the b line now
This is one of the few times i was actually scared for you, that gap isn't big but damn this is so skeetchy!
I just pissed my pants by just looking at what you created
i love it when you upload about berm-peak it self i hope that there will be more Berm-Peak video's
Looks like some thing from backyard trail builds. Sick vid tho.
Seth is watching to much back yard seth and trying to get creative haha
Now we want Kevin to tuck no-hand it 😎🤪
just amazing as always bro
Dewalt = superior drills and screw drivers
Cheapo soldering station lmao
Been watching since before you bought berm peak and I’m a little sad to see such an og feature go but I’m very excited to see the new one
I remember you used ur gravel bike in this video
10:45 Fun fact: I'm 90% sure the insect shown here is not a bee or a wasp, but rather a hoverfly. Hoverflies are a group of true flies that have evolved to disguise themselves as other species that have a defensive sting, despite not having any venom themselves. In the field of ecology, this is referred to as _Batesian mimicry._
so we're making it better, skectchier...
Damn how time flies...
I’m just watching and loving it     Berm peak has evolved so much over the time that i started watching
Release the snakes
"He came here, yeah ..."
Berm Peak has become the great pilgrimage for all YouTube mtb'ers.
Look at this guy screwing around all day for a living!
Spirited Man + Fred Rogers Music + Bike Stuff
I've had really good luck with Penofin wood sealer to keep my north shore from rotting. It's a Brazilian rosewood oil that soaks in to the wood and provides pest, rot, and UV protection. It also does not make your wood slippery like other wood sealers do.
I think I would rather the a line. That turn onto the b line looks sketchy AF. Plenty of snakes on my trail, I can lend you some haha.
Coolest yet stupidest thing ever
Here's a little bit of constructive criticism.  1. I saw the B-line as an alternative for less experienced riders who still wanted to ride Snakepit.   2. The bump is a super good idea! Don't get me wrong, but I see a few places for water and dirt ingress thay you can work on to improve it a little bit more.  Those were really the only things I saw, other then that, I absolutely love the new line!
Hey Seth! That log loader is awesome! There is a fun toy we use at my tree service job it’s a mini skid steer with a branch manager. These things can pick up insane amounts of weight and it’s pretty fun to just the grapple!
I hope there are coming a lot of build video's now
I think this is the first feature that has been replaced on the whole of Berm Peak, but maybe the Airbag jump thou. I personally believe the A line is much less sketch, as you come down and can easily see it before you like a ski jump, but the B line is probably even more sketchy. Great build and video Seth!
Dude! Thank you so much for the opportunity to see this in person and letting us hit it. Scary fun!
Would love to see some long term reviews on all the different tools you us for trail building.
Ur gonna give Alex an aneurysm
This is fascinating. Do you do any prep work before working on the feature? Like any drawings or something? Or do you just wing it on the fly?
On today’s episode of Seth trying to kill people he fixes a skinnny makes it 5 feet off the ground and puts a 6 foot gap in it
Dude! You are really working your ass off. Looks great!
You are such a Renaissance man.
i am actually so sad that you had to take that off but it is for the better
Beautiful place to ride
You should just get some large rubber snakes to put around the "snake" pit and see if anyone notices
the goat
Why don't you secure the wood with some kind of oil or something? It'll last much much longer and still look natural
Good luck to Kyle hitting thaaat backwards
here hello
for 4 minutes straight i thought i am watching an old video
Maybe put som of that chicken fence or something over the wood cause then you can ride it when its wet
Hola 😀😀😀😀
Saludos chicos y chicas bellos hermosos maravillosos
I'm wondering why you keep hammering posts into the ground when you have an excavator and could use the bucket to push them into the ground?
Anazing video!   8:19 this is what i call berm peak music!   Nostalgia from back in the days :)
Great video 🤩🤘🔥
Ya. No. No way.  All yours. Cool but scary. Not me.
replacin an electric chainsaw motor, seems like a video for berm peak express
I didn't think it could get sent more sketchy-
Just after midnight in Aus, a nice little video before I go to bed. Awesome.
Rip og snakepit but glad you made it much more sustainable
You know he's a good youtuber when you like his video's without even watching them yet
When it’s already sketchy and take some days to counter. Then Seth goes, let’s make it about 100 times more sketch
Seth you seen very sweaty
Love you’re vida
It's nice to see Seth building again really gives 2019 nestalgia the music voice overs this just perfect
Hey Seth I recently just broke my collar bone and won't be able to ride for 3 months. The only way I'm maintaining my sanity is by watching all of your videos.  Just wanted to thank you for them.
Siiiiick I was finally able to watch your video when it was just realeased
I love you're trail building videos, Keep up that great work  The new Line is awesome and much more sketchy, but you've done it perfect
I am so happy that building season has begun. Really looking forward to seeing you build the sickest features.
Today were gonna be doing something a little different… but really the same!  You forgot the line but i gotchu Seth! Great vid😁
It looks easy, but I just know I wouldn't be able to ride these features haha
Awsome!, i like you're video man keel it up👌
Hey Seth i love your videos! Keep up the amazing work!  Have a great day!😀
Always excited to see these feature build videos. Thanks for making them!
At our trails we built a gap jump off a skinny log that was modeled directly from the snake pit jump
Seth !!!!
Hi Seth
Hiiii Seth. I’m coming to bern park this summmer and can’t wait
It's so much fun to watch youre video's after school
You should make a third line that ends in a drop
Yes another vid
Kiss me Seth I beg you 😭❤️
Yeah i think the building season has officially begun!
Clicked on the notification at lightspeed
Μπράβο ρε μεγάλε ,ωραία δουλειά !!!

Hello! Happy to be here when it said 1 view!
