I will be playing both Scarlet and Violet on Switch 2 in the future.  Then Legends Z-A on Switch 2 after I bought Legends Arceus and maybe BDSP in the future.
WHO READY FOR ZA!
I don't trust Anyone who misses turn based... Because This is what we'd be returning to. A snoor fest 😴! Something is *WRONG* with you!
Bring Back mega evolution for violet & scarlet
Was, was that Ed Sheeran singing?
I miss the hype season of SV
I've been replaying Scarlet, which got me in the mood to rewatch all the prerelease trailers. The lead up to a new game, a new Gen especially, is always so great. The wondering, the theorizing, the reveals... Can't wait for Z-A's prerelease to get in full swing.
I like coming back and revisiting this video.. I remember holding my cat and watching it, so excited for the new game.. I'll miss him..
👍👍👍
😊👍👍❤❤❤🔥🌱💧🐉👊🐉⚡
Thank you for running  pokemon brick bronze forever😢 and now I can't spell
Aged very well I am from the future
Please have Palworld level graphics for Switch 2 games
Despite all the bugs, what a beautiful experience this was. Thank you Paldea, this was an absolute blast of a journey to go on!! I'm gonna miss this amazing cast of characters in the next generation :(
Y’all don’t know pain until you place yourself in Ed Sheeran’s shoes, making a song for Pokémon after being a fan for years and looking forward to the reception of your song you poured so much love and time into, only to see everyone muting it to not get a strike
Deym.. I guess all the dev budget went to Ed Sheeran eh??
Celestial By Ed Sheeran Is In Ending Theme For Pokemon Scarlet & Violet On Nintendo Switch In Choice V1, V2, Lite, & OLED Model Systems
It's funny that this game pales in comparison to every GBC game. Pathetic!  With this game's price tag, I could use that money to buy a bunch of GBC RPGs instead.
November 18. This marks the first anniversary of Scarlet and Violet! ♥️💜 This may be the laggiest game I have ever played, but it's also one of those few games that I cried over because of the ending. A true masterpiece (if it weren't for the bugs) that is on par with Unova's and Alola's story in my opinion. I'm so thrilled for the Indigo Disk! 💙 I hope Game Freak takes their time in making games in the future to avoid having the opportunities to make the best Pokémon games ever.😊
no way this was a year ago
We need another new Pokémon game I hope it’s like Pokémon ultra sun with mega stone and same gameplay style too
Something about this trailer makes me emotional.  It feels like a sincere fan edit of all the news and leaks we gathered throughput the year, while waiting for this game
it was pretty good.
公文のズンズンが卒業試験
I remember seeing iron treads and great tusk for the first time and screaming
Fuecoco's my favorite starter.

Ferropolilla Reptalada
This is too underrated to their other videos
It's sad that this game failed (I mean it didn't get a high metacritic score it did of course sell really well), it looked like it would be so good.
Ed Sheeran
Ferrodada Colmilargo
I still called it months before the games release I knew they were gonna put this as the closing credits. This collab really changed my view of the game. Finally decided to play it all the way and the area zero fight was amazing. Ngl when the song kicked in made me feel a sense of sadness as it's basically saying you've become the best of the best now shoot for the skies above and keep soaring higher. Truly a special generation as a 20 plus year vet I use to think of what it would be like to have songs recorded special for the franchise. And Ed Sheeran Pokémon didn't disappoint 9/10 only reason being is the bugs in the game are super annoying and took away the immersion feeling other than that best gen by far.
aint no way you just made a deep pokemon video
When YouTubers and streamers have to mute this song during the game's end credits to prevent copyright strikes and takedowns on their channels

The gameplay and the song just make the game look so beautiful. Definitely wanna get Pokémon Violet.
Comment Down Below If You Love Pokemon Scarlet & Violet!
Celestial
I'm not crying I'm Just practicing Surf
Pokémon you are absolutely amazing for keeping the show going for twenty five years,please never give up and enjoy 🙂
From where to download this Game, please help me
I REPLAY your vds EVREY TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍
I just like to come here
I hate how the game launched but the trailer is well made that I just like watching it...  so bad is a fraud
But without ash and pikachu we all sad new journey started of ash and pikachu
I saw the music video for this song and loved it along with the song
Coming back here after the game released ....
I love it 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Ever since I finished Pokèmon Violet. I cannot get this song. The story was very well written and brought me into my feelings especially the ending. I really hope GameFreak continue to put lyrical songs into their games that bring meanings like this one did.
Pokemon Xy please give us more access when get dlc kalos alola galar please
This is the best trailer for anything ever
Can you please redo a pokemon Saphir Alpha and Ruby Omega remake but on Switch with mega evolutions ?  That's just an idea of game for 2023 🫂
This is actually my first pokemon game (pokemon go does not count)
Honestly I thought Sword and Shield was bad enough but I think Scarlet and Violet is worse, it's just not the same anymore, the Villains are no longer evil 😔
Eddie Sheeran yuck
Hololive bring me here
No offense to Gamefreak Nintendo or any fans but Nintendo really needs to get a more powerful system to handle games like this
This is the best thing ever
i have to say i hate ed sheeran but with pokemon i dont mind really, very nice game despite the laggy performance cant wait for the dlc though
DLC please
so i can never see pokemon ultimit jorney cosse i live in siserland and tell me if i can whacht it please.
Who not even watching and just jamming to the music
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Aaj koi wapas layiye is series mein
Looks good. And I'll ash bet is gonna be the pokemon scarlet and violet anime.
Can you make the next game themed from India
Next game : *pokemon conquest 2 * pokemon black and white remix 🆙️🆙️🆙️🆙️🆙️🆙️🆙️🆙️🆙️
I finished the game in a month......... i liked Pokémon Legends: Arceus even more.
2:07
Coming back here after finishing the game feels so different now, the tears are coming back just like they did for the ending. This game is so good, the story is wonderfully done, the emotions from the beginning of your adventures and stories to be told from all aspects, and what it all comes down too, the sacrifices made just so that one can be happy, because the treasure in this game is far beyond than just the connections, and that's what really hits home is just how deeply the story really is  (Spoilers)  "They (the father or mom) always loved you..." - The words Arven always wanted to hear, but grew up without it till the very end, and the way he calls out to them just before disappearing, everything that the actual dad/mom would have said or done, and then using this song back at us to remanence the whole adventure but with a whole new meaning, it's by far one of the best and everlasting memorable Pokemon journeys I'm going to remember!
I know im asking for too much but.....   Can Gamefreak fix shiny pokemons... please?
If Ed Sheeran was a Pokémon in the new game. What would it be?
How to get pokemon scarlet and violent
Pokemon do one thing to end all suffering add the Kanto starters pls
nice game but there is a lot of bug problem and still not fixed. i like open world system. its  good. also i want MEGA EVOLUTION back.  tera and dynamax looks funny. if your goal only making kids happy its ok. good luck )))
Byaway the music in the backround is celestial by Ed sheeran
I don’t like this Pokémon in disguise transformers gimmick. Like they have two with the crystallization in one game. They don’t really jive together either. I prefer the crystal stuff because it harkens back to a lot of stuff throughout the series on a lot of levels.
Good 🌸🌸🌸🌸🏵️🏵️🏵️🏵️🏵️👍👌👌👌👌💐
El q puede puede XD
1:58 is it even possible to pose with all your Pokémon? Since the game came out?
Wow
Is noone pointing out the new terrylize type dragon with a cool hat
Looks like Nemona might be ash’s rival in the next series. She seems to have great desire to be stronger than the mc so she would be a strong rival for Ash who is at a champion level. Also she dreams to become a champion. So she’s going to admire Ash’s strength and will challenge him or go along in his journey to become strong enough to be a Champion.
Get more Pokemon journey hindi episode
What a great time to be alive and be able to play Pokemon! I'm 29 now and I take nothing for granted, one never knows when I'll play my last Pokemon game! But until that day comes, I'll enjoy them with all my heart!
Me/Jite: Time To Terastal!
I'm more surprised that pokemon put an Ed sheeran song on their trailer
My first Pokémon was Pokémon yellow for game boy color loved it ever since gonna preorder it tomorrow Can’t wait until the 18th
I see fuecoco evolution crocalor 😂
Rip to anybody streaming this game since this is supposedly featured in the game
Now that everything spoiled and people are playing the game release it early
Pokémon you got a push this game back I saw the evolutions there they’re only weird thing no offense but they look more like Digimon push this game back I want to play a open world game like this go to hoopsandhiphop Trevenart bro is way better push this game back please and if you guys are not gonna listen to your fans then they’re not going to buy your games so you gotta lose more fans overtime listen to us please so what am I basically saying is ay Pokemon ever heard something called FANS!!!!! 😡😡
This final trailer turned out to be a music video, but you know what?      I still like it.
The trees are looking better
I dont like that the legendaries are just vehicles this gen, that said though this is looking like the best generation since diamond and pearl
This is literally Yugi Oh 5D’s music from the intro, I don’t know if the same people made it but it gives me that kind of vibes right now!
This song really sucks. Ruined the trailer.
Best video ever. Awesome job friends.
First they put Ed Sheeran in my Game of Thrones show, and I said nothing. But now he's showing up in my Pokemon... ... and I LOVE IT! They really nailed it with this trailer - sound and feel and all. I'm not easily moved but this made me PREEMPTIVELY-weepy about my adventures (to come) in Paldea.
The song is just so perfect for this trailer. Ed's a Pokémon fan like any gamer and I'm a huge geek when it comes to Pokémon.
Why do I feel so emotional, though?
imagine if they only made a single complete version for once with all pokemon to date
Pokemon fans: Digimon design is ridiculous, how can a puppy evolve into a machine gun  Also pokemon fans: (literally a lizard turn into a motorbike and space ship, supposedly created as animal that live in the wild) GREAT DESIGN  Sincerely: gen uner
i am excited to see what they evolve to i want sprigatito
lets go new pokemon anime series confirmed thank god it isnt going to end in the galar region
Was that paldean donphan with violet and Scarlet forms?
Goodbye Ash
Unsubscribing because you spoiled the ending of the championship battle Ash Vs Leon
1 week?
I think ash should get his primeape back and have it evolve spoiler primeape has a new evolution
im soo hyyyyyypppppeeeeeee
wow
Does anyone else share my theory that instead of the principle being the twist boss for team star it'd be Penny instead? I mean we haven't heard anything about her and she's supposedly supposed to be part of the Starfall storyline
I’m so hyped you make battles again
Wow
I can't wait until it releases
Pokemon Journeys 135 'Pokemon, Glad I met you' ......🥺🥺😳
Comme ils auront pût faire léopard roux en lui accordant le types normal et spectre
Comme aussi ils auront pût faire un Pokémon tigre rouge au rayures or le classé dans le statut légendaire et lui accordant le types feux et me types spectre et le type lumière
Ils auront bien put faire un lion roux en reprenant le désign de helionveaic en se rapprochant un peut de solgaleo en lui accordant le type feu et le type psy ou normal
Bjour je laisse un commentaire il ne pourrait pas faire des Pokémon légendaire avec le genre de félin Panthera il l'ont bien fait avec solgaleo lion blanc si il rajoute le tigre blanc et la panthères des neiges sa sera mieux et game freak gagnera plus en réalisant des types propre aux tigre blanc et léopard des neiges léopard des neiges types glace et ténèbres Pokémon tigre blanc de types glace et cette fois-ci avec type spectre
One of my biggest hopes for this game is that its possible to get ultra necrozma again
I hope we can turn off the Ed Sheeran song if we stream it. Don’t want a copywrite strike.
Ash won😍😍I wanna see ash how he's in scarlet and violet, how's his journey as and the great bond again between ash-pika😘🤎🥺
there is two days and one week till the new Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is released I am so excited !!!!!
I only have switch lite and i m thinking is this game work good on it
The wheels shall remain the worst legendary idea in the history of Pokemon Co.
At least it looks better than gen 8 but PLA >
It's going to be a long week but a new journey begins 😁
Looks pretty good 👌🏻
Day 8,030 of wanting a pokemon bedvolution line of consisting of Footon, Bedfu & Bedass.
It's almost here letss goo man🔥🔥💯💯😭😭
Ed Sheeran 😭😭😭
For some reason, watching this trailer made me kinda tear up, like happy or nostalgia tears. I don’t know why; maybe it’s the song
Sad thing is, this is a really awesome trailer, not because of the video itself but because of Ed Sheeran. Take the music away and you've got something kinda... Bleh.
Dear Pokemon company my name is Beckham I'm 12 years old I been wondering if you need a Pokemon I hope you guys make a ghost type fossil Pokemon I would like it to be a Spinosaurus it will two evolutions the pre evolution is Spinuley a poison and ghost type Pokemon then ounce it evolves it turns into Spinulcorus like the spinal cord please let this cool and scary plus terrifying Pokemon in Pokemon Scarlett and Violet to game freak and the Pokemon company by Beckham David
I'd say (Something New by Axwell /\ Ingrosso) goes neatly with this trailer as well.
ed sheeran Pokemon confirme
What a terrible song choice for this reveal.
Never thought i would need Mammoth Donphan, but here we are
make new gym leader but fairy type
Nobody's gonna talk about the new awesome Girafarig?
In Pokemon Arceus we were able to get the other two starters in the after game, I hope this one does it also.
Game looks like dog shit lmao
looks like shit
All things considered Graphics wise, this looks pretty good for a 2015 game!
ED SHEEREAN GOT ME BAWLING 😂 😂 😂
But when does the Steam Deck port release?
I can't wait for the adventure, seems amazing.
me: I never cry Also Me: Sobbing at this trailer
The trailers not half bad when played on mute!
This song is like a childhood
Remember to report bot comments. Yes, those girls are bots.
Tbh im glad we still havent seen starter evos, im looking forward to not know until i get the game and see for myself
....they transform into vehicles.   Wow.
Please make a water buffalo Pokemon and it type is water/fight. 🐃
What I have noticed is that they seem to be gearing up to join the mmo on a console style gameplay for the future. The way they keep adding more interactive multiplayer features aside from the standard trading/battling, and now allow us to see and interact with each other in the open world is a big step towards that. We may yet see the large open world with all regions within the next decade if this keeps up. GG PokemonCO, Gamefreak, and Nintendo! Massive step forward and I look forward to the 18th!
1:23 is that fidoughs evolution?
im so underwhelmed. not even pokemon music :(
anyone else hate the motorcycle pokemon?
Honestly ed.... Why
Bring back girl trainers next game. Both look like a boy
You need to our alreamie in this she’s so underrated in the games :,)
No but why am I crying
that ed sheeran song is homophobic
That giant crab thing looks delicious
Bring swirlix back but with a better evo
I feel the generation designs are worse than Black and White.
I actually f*ck with this. Heavy
Song 👎🏻
Dude, GameFreak needs to step it up -- they are YEARS behind, and it's honestly embarrassing. They're fucking KILLING it, and this game looks SO GOOD!
Now I just need to know how early I can get a Riolu
NEW EEEVVEEEEEELLLUUUUTTIIIOOOOONNNNSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!
NEW EEVEELUTIONS!!!!!
THERE BETTER BE NEW EEVEELUTIONS!!!
The sandwich at 1:25 is so low-poly that you’d cut your mouth on it if you actually tried eating it 💀
SOlo dire que estoy emociado por ver este pokemon, como no me sentia desde el 2002 :) gracias por acompañarme toda la vida pokemon
To all my bros expecting the starter evolutions I feel your pain
bro its that little booger thats been fowling me asking for  coin in pokemon go
.
I'm not crying, so excited. Pokemon always brings my childhood back and this gen looks so so great.
this game looks good ig, but the crystal-like forms the pokémon go to look terrible
ED SHEERAN?
Wow, looks like the gamefreak got lazy at Pokémon design and just threw a bunch of knockoff together, the Minecraft Pokémon is a joke! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I swear voilet will be a bad version cuz the future forms have no drip
Just saw all the new pokemon from the leaks. Honestly this is the worst generation. They all look terrible. 🥲☹️
I really like this song
Ah yes professor Chad lmao
Definitely using multiple teams lmao, probably have a couple of monotypes lmao
Im so glad they changed some of the models, they look more natural to that Pokémon unlike before with them dead inside-
The lucario model is now different, looks more natural for a lucario tbh
Geeta reminds me so much of izuru kamakura
They look so bad, they look so bad. 90% of the new mons look like they're from different franchises. This will be the wost gen. Even worse than SwSh.
top notch!!!
For a brand thats all about "evolving" Pokemon games are the slowest when it comes to progression.  Man, if they ever make an teen to adult theme game, I will peel over.
So... is anybody going to talk about the fact that Ed Motherfreaking Sheeran is in a pokemon trailer?
Can't wait for this game
Ed Sheeran is secretly the champion
the hype is real! only 8 days to go(from writing this)!
8 days again!!
I'm stoked about the Pokedex roster so far. If someone wanted to "accidentally" leak the rest...that'd be amazing. Either way, the game looks great. I can't wait to take selfies with my homeboi Fuecoco (and hopefully Greedent!)
Wow Sheeran really just made the most formulaic garbage for this game. Please tell me this isn't in the game
Hey go fix the matchmaking in UNITE !!!
Beautiful
I *JUST* saw the evo leaks and I'm so upset they're all *so fucking ugly* why did y'all do this gen so dirty?! This will be the new B&W in terms of unliked designs, I can feel it.
距离发售还有8年
the music be like : getting gay with kids is here!
I know the terastilize hat thing is the new gimmick but it looks stupid af.
Im gonna miss my bae Nessa
WAS THAT JUST THE PARADOX FORMS CONFIRMED
Seeing Ancient Donphant lumbering sent a chill up my spine
Never has the starter evolutions been kept a secret this long this close to release.  I'm scared
Pokémon's Official Site is missing the Past/ Future Donphan thing.
Dislike earned because of ed sheeran
This video was SO AWESOME! LOVED IT! The killer Ed Sheeran song just made me love it even more! SO excited for these games! AHHHH! ALL OF MY FEELS! ;A;
Super excited for the game on the 18th (9 Days!!!)
Can't wait to get it for Christmas! I always get a new Pokemon game
We need the pokemon arceus non battle throw
I'm genuinely confused as to WHY you people want to see the starter evolutions. Do you just not want to play the game to find out?
couldve done without the sheerean back track fr
needs to ad loud music and boost pokemon cries, because if they didnt i bet this would be so quiet. ad voice acting please.
Tcg live is trash, pls dont ruin the online community
Ed sheeran
Haven't bought or played s pokenon game since gba
Why haven't they added Voice Dialogue to Pokemon games yet?
pokemon is deadass running outta ifeas these new pokemon look so shit ngl
That is how you do a goddamn release trailer!
Seeing Ancient Donphant lumbering sent a chill up my spine
that was great ed sheeran

Appreciated.
why is the graphics so low res
Hey, if anyone want certain Kanto, Johto, Sinnoh, or Hoenn Pokémon in Apricorn Poké Balls, let me know and I'll tell you if I have it or not.
Hey this game comes out on the day Michael Jackson’s Thriller 40th anniversary album releases.
I’d just call this a music video.
could have done without stupid ed Sheehan song but excited about phone cases so yay
This series is popping up again, I feel like something big is about to happen
This series is popping up again, I feel like something big is about to happen
That really adds a feeling of wonder and history to the game. Thats exciting.
what an unbearable song 😅
I'm definitely going with the PLA phone. It'll be really cool to have a Rotom Phone designed like the Arc Phone from Pokemon Legends: Arceus.  In fact, I won't be surprised if it becomes the most popular choice among Scarlet & Violet players.
The Ed SHEERAN song sucks pokeballs
I hope furfrou is in Pokemon scarlet and violet
Ed Sheeran was literally the weirdest choice ever
I’ve come to love Pokémon so much over the years. For me is about the experience more than anything. Just imagine though, if they ever decided to make the Pokémon world more realistic. Would be the game of a generation.
I was on the fence about getting this game but I think Ed Sheeran helped me decide. Hard pass.
We need are starter evo's!!
Can’t believe we’re so close.  Also, this was a great music video!
Dreepy 😭😭😭❤️❤️
Nice Song! <3
Even they haven’t leaked any evolutions and we were all hoping, isn’t it better this way?? Like last year when Spider-Man has all three show up in the movie, didn’t it make it better? It’s kind of a rarity now
Stay Mad Ya PC idiots 🤣
i don't like this music, it doesn't really fit Pokémon
Professor Turo though~ “I promise that it will be an experience worth treasuring if you COME”. 🤪🥵😳🍆🥵🤪😳🥵🥵😳😳😳🥵😈
NGL, I wasn’t expected Ed Sheeran in a Pokémon add.
What a terrible choice of music.
Can’t wait to get im pre ordering it on Saturday
Pokemon are motorcycle now WTF
My boys fuecoco and miridon are underrated.
But I can't afford a Nintendo or Violet
This is so lively
The pre-launch coverage of this game has been pathetic and embarrassing. I never thought we'd be less than 2 weeks out with no official reveal of the starter evolutions, and no definitive version exclusive list that details the exclusives from the NEW generation.  TPC, if you want us to pre-order the game, we need to know which version to get. By barely providing us any info on what to expect in each one, you've lost a lot of pre-orders, including me.  How about instead of an Ed Sheeran music video, we actually get some basic, useful information?
If anyone sees this comment please read it. There is a scam going around and a fake pokemon account is trying to scam you by telling you youve won a giveaway. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS
I want Nintendo to know that the lack of face for iron treads made me switch my preorder from Violet to scarlet
*(Happy tooth fairy hamster sounds)*
💜❤️
W game
hope the pokémon don't let me down, pretty cool i am then they come out right on my birthday
Pokemon company is it going to be gen 10 in 2026 the last generation
you should make a dragon type pokemon simaler to dragaopult
Time to move to another gen. I will miss gen 8 so much.
Weeee pensaba que lo de las formas pasadas y futuras era falso
Please run well! This game looks great but I hope we don’t have massive frame drops in the final build!
Ed Sheeran securing the bag for this one!
I think it’s amazing! 🤩
I feel like I'm watching a badly made fan video. Excited for the game but very weird choice of artist for the game.
The Ed Sheren feels a bit like a cheap shot lol
Is it just me or does the music reeeeaally  not match with the trailer or with pokemon at all? to me it also just highlights how static and slow everything is in the game, when you contrast it with a fast upbeat song
The new donphan forms 😍
OMG, what if they aren't showing the starter evolutions because depending on the game they are different. Like we see that Donphan is getting a different evolution. And in Arceus the starters had a different evolution compared to their modern counterparts. So what if the starters final evolutions are different?
I can't wat
Ed sheran ? really ? can we have something even more out of context pls ?
This quite literally gave me goosebumps
אני ילד? חחח מעניין ילדים. לא אותי
I'm getting violet the forms are better in my opinion
I’m so excited! I just hope that we’ll be able to wear other outfits other than the school uniform
I cried
I came back to see if it was a dream but no, yall hyper us to watch a fanmade-mashup-quality clip with that ed sheeran song..
What business did Ed Sheeran have being in this trailer
I’m so tired of waiting, next week can’t come fast enough this is Torture man 😂🤦🏾‍♂️ it’s not the 18th yet??? Y’all sure??
Love everything about the game so far except for this song
Same shit Every Year
How dare you?? You know we don’t give a fuck about an Ed Sheeran song. We’re here for more info about the game!
Im really suprised. I still think the visual representation is kinda wacky but gameplay-wise it could be something new, like everyone was hoping for.
Finally, a Pokemon game worth  pre-purchasing. Cant wait to get my hands on kt
As expected the leaker already did a better job. I loved Meowscarada though.
Almost 30 years old and I'm about to cry😅. I'm really excited!
Honestly when this song released and I realized it was for scarlet and violet I got so excited plus Toby fox also working on tracks for the game this games gonna have one of the most hype soundtracks ever in my opinion
super excited to play this 🥲
Very nice
2:33 THE LEAKS ARE REAL!
I'm not sobbing over Sprigatito running, you are. T_T
Video is a million times better with sound off
grafics = ugly gameplay = boring pokemon = shitty humans = getting hotter crystals = boring sandwiches = uncreative  ---------------------------------------- Game = not worth the purchase prediction = 3 overpriced DLCs
Looks like shit.
Ima deff have all the phone cases lol
What's up with Nintendo and using these cool songs to promote games!? First Sonic (Obviously with I'm here) but they used "Don't stop me Now" for the latest trailer and now this? Definitely gets me hype for both games!
Saw the leaks for the evolutions specially the starters and oh boy those who will buy this garbage of a game are in for a great disappoinment!!! Hope this gen would FLOP! If that's what it takes for those greedy studio and company to stop and ponder! Also don't expect for a good or even an ok story with this rushed game! Not to mention how's your subscription to Pokemon Home I meant Pokemon prison! Again see you next year Pokemon hope you'll find the love and care from other studios.
Old is gold
Damn this trailer was HYPE
3:26  I think the giant pit is actually the elite four because there’s a building with a giant silver ball that might be an elevator to go down into to elite four’ rooms,either that or the big climatic fight with the legendary of your game.
i wonder what the enemy team is, like team yell from sword and shield
The song is so nice :,)
TPC could have hired voice actors for the characters instead of spending money on Ed Sheeran. This song is very average, nothing really memorable or enhance the gameplay experience in any way... Waste of money
*Has all fully evolved pokemon including Tyranitar*  That one Quaxly: 👋 👋 👋
Can’t wait waited for this day for so long
Hate the song, but excite for the game.
With Scarlet and Violet coming out soon, it’s our chance to tell the Pokémon company what we want.  Like voice acting.
We're so close!!
I hope we get good postgame, for me emerald had the best. That battle frontier was great. Hopefully we get something challenging like it
Is anyone gonna talk about Ed Sheeran? I know it was expected but still it’s kinda crazy
Donphan evolution
Isn’t the game coming out in like less then 2 weeks? They really going to not reveal the starters?
This takes me back to gen 1 them actually having lyrics with the music ♥️
I'm actually excited for this.. my friend would absolutely love it too RIP Damo 💜 I'll play this for you
I'm pretty excited about the games, but the raids are just worrying me.. First of all, the Eevee and Charizard events are just Nintendo exploiting FOMO again. Many people, especially kids, will get the games for christmas and miss out on the opportunity to participate in such events. And even if you already own the game, you basically have to rush it in order to get there.  Raids were incredibly annoying in SW/SH, basically your NPC team members did everything to prevent you from succeeding, due to completely stupid Pokemon or attack choice, so you were basically pushed towards a subscription. And even with that, you basically never get anyone joining normal 5 star raids, if it's not a shiny or sth special.  It seems like they are more and more pushing us into Games as a Service, which simply sucks. I play Pokemon because I want a neat single player experience and be able to achieve everything solo. Why do they have to do stuff like that, basically force you to rush through the game and even get a subscription?
I Feels like watching HTTYD :)
Looks like sht
hoping for better graphics than this for nintendo :( there's so many rough edges it hurts the eye T_T
Well guess I'll continue to not order it since we still dont know which version locks what content.
Alright, every trailer has made me more and more excited about these games. And this... wow. I might just weep because I can't get my hands on them yet. There's so much still to discover, so much I can still learn that's (probably) not in the trailers so far. I love how they've done this!
Anyone else notice that they gave Eevee his Gen 1 sound back?
Maybe the Scarlett legendary is not good enough but the others are quite better than violet for eg donphan
Trash song added to the video... definitely makes me not want to buy this when I heard it.
*quaxly gang assemble*
The art fonts for violet in 'pokemon violet' title is less creative to me, you can design a lot better for that word since it is the title
So excited now. Love the song choice! Great trailer!
I really hope in the next mainline game the catching mechanics from Legends Arceus comes back... I don't mind all other classic aspects like battles etc, but the freedom in catching Pokemon in legends was a life changer by not having to go through various screens etc...
Had to turn the sound off to watch the video
No sprigattito don't stand up!
Why does this have to release so close to Sonic Frontiers?! I want to play both!
I know a lot of hardcore fans wanted more details about the game, but honestly this trailer has made me feel more then anything pokemon related in years. Its totally hyped me up to not just play the games, but to fully experience them with all my heart. They really nailed it with this one, put the heart and soul back in pokemon and im so here for it.
What is that melody?!
Can't wait to start my Paldea Adventure with Quaxly
They’re really marketing the hell out of this game 😂
I be honest I would prefer a black and white remake
Plz Hindi season all pokemon
Plz Hindi season all pokemon
Plz hindi pokemon
Donphan at 1:45
that crystal thing has to be one of the ugliest gimmicks pokemon games has
i'm disappointed in everything i've seen of these games so far. using this awful Ed Sheeren song designed to be as commercial as possible for this trailer has cemented the idea that Pokemon is so out of touch with what the fanbase wants and cares more for what's popular in general. i'm so tired of this franchise trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator. I'm done, I cannot support this franchise anymore.
Paradox Donphan???
Literally I cannot WAIT for this game! I’m so glad they aren’t revealing too much so you can experience new things on your own time!
Damn, this was great bar the song.
brother don't end pokemon
I’m probably still gonna play it because pokemon has been my favorite game series since I was like six, but I know I’m still gonna be disappointed
Bro that futuristic and primal donphan was so cool
This song's good, though it sounds like it belongs in a disney movie.
This is the best pokemon trailer ever the only one you can vibe too
Will this have overworld shinies?
I kinda hate that I’m no longer excited for Pokémon games. I saw the final starter evos, I saw the mid stages too, I did all the things I did that got me excited for the new games before and I still felt indifferent. I still just feel meh about this one especially after the last game.
Glad to get our first look at the paradox forms.
We want Tobias back
Is it a differ game from pokemon go ? What is this plz tell anyone
Gonna buy it, but damn does the switch make this game look ugly. Looks like an early PS2 game.
Why are people freaking out. This is all shit we've seen before over generic pop lol
It’s Just black
the trading animation looks so sick
They are really hyping this game up. Let's go
Me want grass cat
Ed Sheeran has ruined this....
❤😻🥳
0.14 ,so the starter Pokemon are a grass type cat , a water type duck ,& a Fire type crocodile ,,
Shut up and take my money gamefreak!!!
Hey, all my bros expecting the great evolution. I Really feel your pain... 🤥
Lmao 99% of stuff you've already seen, two shots of new Pokemon and also Ed Sheeran is here for some reason
Please subscribe
Looks like a dream i had in 1999.
This is the most hype I’ve been for a Pokémon game since x and y, lord please let these games be good
Did i just catch a glimpse of a Donphan evolution
The final trailer to these games, see y'all when the games drop
Ed Sheran is gay
1:09 Can we take a second that they made a sitting animation for Smoliv. They didn’t have to make that animation, but they did anyways, and that’s nice.
ed sheeran music caught me off guard
Volvieron los Pokémon
To all my bros expecting the starter evolutions I feel your pain
This music kinda fire though.
Donphan past looks super good! The future is cool too, although its round face looks rather goofy. To all my brothers who are waiting for the beginning, I feel your pain😀😀
So can we see the starter Evos yet?
God this look like shit
The song fits pretty well. Now I’m hyped!
Honestly looking crisp
I'm excited for the future/ancient forms.. that Donphan leak was crazy af.
Starting those nostalgic memories already
Why thw shitty music playing
why do the graphics look like a gamecube game though? not flaming. Just curious, there's no way the polygon limit is even remotely close to being exceeded for memory issues on the switch. So why not invest more into shaders and improved render physics?
They should of spent the money on the game instead of Ed Sheeran.
If I have all the games previously do I got all the rotor cases? Lol
I personally it's great we didn’t get the starter evolutions. I think it’ll be more fun as a surprise if they didn’t announce the starter evolutions at all. I just hope they all turn into something equally cool.
I didnt expect to be  a music vid
Thank you, Pokémon channel ❤️🌹✅
I’m excited to wait for her as soon as possible. Why didn’t Pokémon download on PS5
I kinda want pokemon to postpone the games and just work on the graphics and animations. Im not one of those “THE TREES RUIN THE GAME” people but you know, they should be able to animate cutscenes and not do that annoying cut to black.
The faces are weird 💀
I love that song I wanna buy it
the music is diguesting
Glad they didn't show the starter evolutions. This might actually end up being the first Pokémon game since I was a little kid with a GBA and a copy of Pokémon Ruby (I'm a 27-year-old father of two now lol) that won't get utterly spoiled for me before I ever even get a chance to play the game. Which actually feels pretty great imo.  So yeah, as long as I can continue to avoid any major leaks, this hype train is gonna keep on rollin' for me all the way to release day! :)
3:27 MAJOR How to train your dragon vibes
The music really hits right on the spot and gave me chills
Man they really put all of the budget into the particle effects, im not getting the game myself so I’m excited for all the let’s plays!
Ed sheeran got paaaaaid $$$$
OMG Donphan evolves!? That powerful Mofo!? This is amazing!
I've never played an open-world game before!
Fuecoco, and Cyclizar are the Pokèmon I can't  wait to use!
The fact they got Ed Sheeran to make a song for the new Pokèmon games me cry  tears of joy!
A new pokemon? I wanna see more
I'm literally in tears rn. New Pokèmon games, amazing new possibilities with new Pokèmon, and Ed Sheeran making a new song, called Celestial, all in one?
Absolutely loved this
Wow wow wow 🥰😳😳😳
where wimpod
It’s end of Pokémon Era, engine to the feet?? Theirs nothing else they can think of the design?? What next?? Transformer?
I was at work thinking "god damn I'm gonna have to watch this when I get home cause I want to see it with the sound on", then I saw the text in the lower left corner at 00:18 and happily just watched the whole thing on mute.
This looks amazing it’s worth the 60 bucks
is that fucking Ed sheeran
Disgosten
Ancient Donphan looks like what a mega evolution would have looked like for Donphan
This videos vibe makes it feel like this is the final step in the Pokémon series, or atleast close to it
So... no starter evolutions 😐
Yeah these games are going to probably be shit. All Gamefreak does is release pure ass at this point
Lucario terrastalized is insane... I want one too
really dont like the futuristic designs but im stuck with getting violet cause my color is purple and m friend already preordered scarlet so we can see compare them with eachother . i hope i can till get the actually cool looking donphan
Why do do the pokemon have Chandler on there heads 🤦. Something new I guess 🤷
Bad trailer but a banger song
Noone talking about how well the music fits
LETSS GO FUTURISTIC DONPHAN AND ANCIENT DONPHAN
Ancient Donphan is a chad, Future Donphan needs a therapist
Anyone else gonna try to get both of the games
Why does this sound like a 2013 Minecraft parody?
ドンファンの未来はどうなってんだ？ 全体の形が想像つかない
I’m excited, tho I won’t be getting it on released day but Ima try to save up to buy it, I will get Pokémon violet.
this is an incredible trailer
I want another eevee evolution come on!!!
Cyborg Donphan doesn't exist, it can't hurt y-
lol wtf with the Ed Sheeran 💀
No one’s going to talk about Ed Sheran’s song in a Pokémon game 😭
Dear God what sheer beauty did I just witness!
Glad to see Donphan get two forms. At this rate I’m not expecting the final evolutions for the starters. Plus I forgot that it’s coming out next Friday so I’m definitely gonna be reading for my Scarlet adventure next weekend. 😁
Hi like the song on Pokémon
Songs kind of a vibe ngl
the song fits perfectly with this and i already know im gonna big nostalgia soon
damn theyre really running out of colors aren't they?
I saw a lot of people giving this trailer shit coz it’s “the same stuff again” and coz of Ed Sheeran (lol) but honestly, this really, REALLY hyped me up! This was a beautiful final trailer before release. Friday can’t come fast enough! 🤩
Am I the only one who’s gonna ask which genius decided to put an Ed Sheeran song over a Pokémon trailer? Like what in gods name made them think of that?
Jkollolo Pppppppppplpppppxuppppy
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Looks so fun.
The song mixed with the video... Chills
The legendaries are meh, and the crystal stuff is dumb. Still looks like a good game.
Yeah. I'm glad I'm in the camp that didn't want to see the final evos. Cause I mean I miss the surprise of seeing what the Pokémon I picked at the would turn into given time. Disappointment or not.
Say what you will about Ed Sheeran, but the song really helps the trailer stand out in a great way. This is probably my tenth time watching this, and I still get a bit emotional each time. Pokémon has been with me almost my whole life, and it’s helped me get through some rough points. So seeing how far it’s come makes me very happy. I’ll probably keep watching this trailer each day to count down to the release.
Ed Sheeran really don’t miss 🙏🏾
I love the song and the look of the game in the video, but they don't fit together too well honestly
Bro ngl this got me a little emotional. Also that past donphan is what I needed in my life.
The Ed Sheeran song lost me 💀💀
PARADOX POKEMON ARE REAL WOWOWOWOWOWO  AMOONGUSS TIME?????????
New Forms
Celestial is even more 🔥 than Fuecoco. Well done, Ed Sheeran, and this is the craziest trailer I’ve seen! Paldea looks promising! Another region, another adventure. Almost next week. Get ready 🔴🟣
why does a triple A game from the largest franchise in the entire world have gmod graphics in 2022
You can customize Rotom phone?!
wtf is this
Ed Sheeran did not need to go this hard with the track 😂
YAAAS
Why tf is Ed Sheeran on this video ahahah it makes 0 sense
Nice to see a Pokemon with the travel theme getting the past/future forms(?) treatment. Donphan is basically a wheel after all.
This doesnt look like Pokemon at all xD
Odd that theres no bad comments, I wonder where they went.
it looks ugly
I'm sorry is that a fucking motorcycle quadruped?
You really had LeQuack taking the L in this presentation? Cmon Pokémon
anyone else get jumpscared by ed sheeran?
Is it me or does this look boring?
I hate that I like this song, I usually don't like this kind of music.
Well proof that I totally called the Neo and Proto version exclusives.
Omg different forms of Donphan!  Also love the ghost love in this gen, so glad Dragapult is in.   So hyped to play this game soon!
I am way too exited for this game I have a paper with marks for everyday until it finally comes out also make sure you avoid leaks I accidentally clicked on a leak video for legends acreus
Is... is this the longest we've ever gone without getting starter evolutions? Like, we didn't even get their second forms or anything.
so no real legendary pokemon, just an open world filled with kids... smdh. Just Give us R/B/Y/S/G type game with these graphics. stop screwing us over
............tempted to cancel my pre-order just for this stupid "special" "can't miss!" News or whatever they called it just to get this video....
Cool trailer but the music doesn't resonate with me.
I love almost everything about Violet except the ride pokemon. Its doggy loping in just not my thing. It is definitely cooler as a ride if it would use its wheels. It would bring out very metal rock-n-roll type thing, but the doggy hop is just so bad. It is mostly why I am choosing Violet. The ride pokemon is just cooler.
*The past Donphan looks super good! The future one is also cool, though it’s circle face looks kind of goofy.*
thanks for the gay music nintendo
Ngl the starters of this region are shit but the rest of the game looks promising
God fucking dammit nintedo
Imagine not even showing us what the rest of the starters evolution line 😫
helllll yeah i can weaponize baby dragons again
Ok this was one of the best game trailers I have ever seen we know this will be good
I wait for Pokémon scarlet and violet ❤️❤️❤️🔥🥰🥰❤️❤️
free virtual phone cases instead of an actual phone case. you guys really have lost all sense of integrity as a company you deserve  to get your game leaked imo 🤣
Newbie(ish) here! This’ll be the first Pokémon game I’ve preordered. Looking forward to catching them all with you fine folks!
Let's go Trainers.
So glad I got scarlet, Donphan has always been one of my favs and the prehistoric version looks dope! Donphan was a perfect choice for a past/future split too because of the tire vs mammoth aesthetic
Donphan and girafarig. Really trying to give us new unexpected evolutions Game freak?
I really hope primeape isnt version exclusive he was my favorite pokemon back when the anime came on at 5am on kids wb in 1997, ash never returned for primeape, but i will i already preordered violet so im praying to arceus i can catch a mankey in the base game...
After Dynamax we got another? Now with crystal?
Do people really care about this trash series anymore?
I gotta get this song! It rocks man!!
A past Gengar with the anime Primordial form and a future one of him as a Hologram would be perfect for this!
POKÉMON SCARLET AND VIOLET ANIME SERIES WILL BE ON DISNEY XD AND UNIVERSAL KIDS NOT NETFLIX
Pikachu original cry
❤❤
i love chaos and mayhem and i will commit tax evasion and arson
I can’t wait.
Omg a voice in pokemon part 2 ft ed sherin
No Shedinja >;(
When they show off the *best* footage and it's still looks like a beta version of a crappy mobile game complete with stuttering animations.  But it will sell 60 million copies because of course it will. And that's why it will never improve
I wish they’d reveal more gen 9 Pokémon. A lot of people think this is the generation where we break the 1000 Pokémon number in the Pokédex and I really want an all gen 9 team for both games
new donphan type prediction Past donphan - ground fighting Future donphan - psychic fighting
plot twist: the starters don't have evolutions lol
and we STILL dont know the starters evos yet... this edging is going way to much
i giggled at the music
2:41 Ice-fire type ?
2:19 I was hoping to see Koraidon use its wheels in a trailer, but it looks like it can only run 😭
Good song
i feel like I'm gonna be disappointed
Before the game releases take 1 more guess on what the starters will evolve into.
OMG, this song is totally sweet! I really love that you can get different cases for your Rotom Phone as well! However, I’m also disappointed that the starter Pokemon’s evolutions still haven’t been revealed yet. I mean, come on, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet are coming out in just a week from Friday, and yet the starters’ evolutions still haven’t been revealed yet! Unless… they don’t have any evolutions this time! I hope that they do have evolutions! Please, Pokemon Company! Reveal the starters’ evolutions before Scarlet and Violet are released! I just hope that the rumor that Sprigatito’s final evolution will be half Fairy type and based on a flamenco dancer is true! Thank you so much! 👸🏻🧚🏻‍♀️🧜🏻‍♀️🧞‍♀️💃🏻💝💖💗💕🌹💐🌷🌸🌺🎀🩰🐱🦄🍰🧁🍩
Not a lot of comments about how good the song was for this particular trailer. Raised the hype to unreal levels
cant wait to use donphan, always loved him as a kid watching the anime
I'm so glad the best boi Donphan is getting the love they deserve. Donphan's forms look so cool.
What do the starters evolve into? I read about Fuecoco's evolution being called... (Press read more to see spoiler)              Crocalor???
I feel I'm the only one who thinks it's weird these Pokemon can be automobiles
The song is good
It keeps getting worse. clearly running out of ideas. pokemon motor bikes wtf. starters just look stupid. legends are now robot motor bikes. please let this be the last one. keeps getting worse and worse.
can we please get the starter evolutions now.
remember taht time pokemon used an ed sheeran song in their trailer? me too
I hate Ed Sheeran so I watched the whole thing on mute :(
Had to watch this on mute.
So this basically quaxly in the first 20 secs 😅✌️
Nice to see Carkol is back :) They're my favorite dog and by dog I mean pile of coal :)
ITS DEDENNE OMG YES. MY LITTLE NUGGET IN A TRAILER!!!!
Didn't expect to hear non ingame music here, but not shocked about it since we have Post Malone in Pokemon
LUCARIO MY BELOVED
AMP Exclusive TakeOver
Lol this cheery trailer trying to hide the performance jank HARD
Bit less on the reveals. Donphan paradox forms were nice but the real shocker was ed sheeran in the trailer lol
My theory, In the path way to legends Arven,  looks for the berries, and Arven also has the books,  so those two new Pokémon are  2 other legendaries in the game. They are the final titan that you fight to get the fifth badge in the path of legends, why else would this story be called path of legends? That is my guess any way.
As a long time fan of the pokemon series, I usually like the new pokemon as i still do with this generation, but the quality of these games have been so bad since for nearly a decade now. The games are so rushed and they just look awful, i gave gen 7 and 8 a chance but not anymore. Sorry but i will not be buying another pokemon game ever again until the quality of these games improve.
Can’t believe it’s already 1 week away from the Scarlet and Violet release. Feels like yesterday the first trailer released
I'm a violet advocate all the way, but past donphan looks soooo cool
Bring back mega evolution. FFS.
Never muted a video so fast before. Cool trailer.
The music is amazing😊
Why bikes though
I’m not sure what I expected from this trailer, but hearing Ed Sheeran wasn’t it.
Garbage game  Terrible frame rate 😵  Nonexistent graphics 😴  = garbage game, should go straight to the trash 🗑
Perfect! I just wish Gliscor was added.
Getting violet for Ceruledge alone lol
i’m still waiting for mimikyu to be in here
Video is 1080p60, not what we'll experience.
Perhaps this Gen, I will have a Dragonite. I usually don't train well known pokemon. It is one I have seen through the years, and I just never had one. Too bad Smeargle won't make the cut.
Klawf is literally a crab from the code lyoko world 😂
Did anyone Else see that terrakion looking pokemon thing?
I'm so happy to see dragapult and garchomp I hope is in cuz if it is then the Tera boost will make it unstoppable
This makes me wanna play pokemon violet and have the best time
Ed Sheeren 🤢
i got teary-eyed 🥲
The important thing to take from this is that Dedenne is gonna be in it right off the bat.
i hope paras and parasect are in this gen I want to bring my favorite parasect that i've had for 18 years to this game 🙏🙏🙏
love this - with the song, this is a total vibe!
This trailer made me feel nostalgic, and for a game I've not even played. Excellent use of Ed's song, and I cannot wait to play this game. To new trainers and returning veterans alike, let's have a blast!
Moto pokémon, really?
im sorry but ed sheeran was entirely unneeded here.........
Ed sheeran is mid and whatever company he works for has been claiming reactions for this, that's not good. Do you want people to stop watching and discussing these trailers? Get someone that is actually active in the pokemon community like GlitchXCity to make some music. Toby fox was a great idea for swsh, indee music maker that doesn't have another corporeration lording over them(undertale/deltarune are considered indee games)
Everyone here loves pokemon right?
Ughh... time to shell out another 120$
Pairing Pokémon with modern pop music feels SUPER weird to me, I’m not into it.
Ed Sheeren was a weird choice but the trailer was really good!
Why don’t you guys at game freak make a scarlet/violet incense violet incense for Pokémon scarlet and vice versa that lets you get version exclusives
Someone please tell me that I'm not the only one who actually likes the robotic donphan
Nice trailer
*Seeing Ancient Donphant lumbering sent a chill up my spine*
Are we gonna get a new eeveelution and some new regis
Ooh, you get unique Rotom Phone cases depending on the past Pokémon games you have.  What a nice bonus.
✨Vibes✨
Nintendo is going all Hollywood with the presentation it's almost tragic that they are still afraid of voice acted in their core games
why is- why i- why did you get ed sheeran to make a song for you-
I’m hyped for this!!!
Hmm I wonder if there's going to be a Completely different final evolution for the Starter pokemon like since Pokémon Scarlett is about the past may be the final evolution starter pokemon are prehistoric and in Pokémon Violet, the final evolution starter are from the future 🤔
Alright, this just came up in my mind, and some probably won’t care, but this, along with the whole game, has the potential for some seriously good lore. My question is: How does the player meet Koraidon/Miraidon? (sorry for the terrible spelling) There’s a shot of V!Florian at 0:17 , and the background lines up with the next shot of Koraidon standing in front of S!Juliana, growling. (i’m taking a guess and saying the scene is the same, they’re just using a different version) There’s something about Koraidon standing *in front* of the player and growling, along with Florian’s startled expression (in what is most likely the same scene) that doesn’t sit right with my little theorist brain. What do you all think?
this would be great if ed sheren wasn't playing
I was not expecting to open this video to Ed Sheeran
This video got me so much more hype even though it wasn't much new.
at 3:11 if you zoom in the corner you see a possible phanphy paradox maybe just maybe but that would be very cool
Excited for next week. I hope my copy will arrive day 1.
I still don’t know how to feel about Wiglett. I dislike it but I’m also still intrigued by it. I bet both forms of Diglett feel the same way. 🤣
WAIT CAN YOU CAN MAKE ANY POKEMON INTO CRYSTALS?!
Gave me the same satisfying feeling as when they released the sword and shield trailer with the song “brave new world”
Idk why it’s funny that an Ed Sheeran song is put over a Pokémon trailer
W😊
🤯 GOODNESS‼️ GRACIOUS‼️ I am SO HYPED for these games‼️
10 Day count down has started!
I AM SO EXCITED!!
10/10
crazy how far the game has come from growing up with pokemon blue/red. Glad to see a company that keeps innovating new products and keeps things fresh.
Should I get violet or scarlet?
The graphics make me sad; Sword and Shield graphics were great. Hope this game will feature the most important thing with choose your storyline and open world; dynamic leveling system so it won't be overly easy to beat when I spend first 4 hours exploring.
*The Scarlet Legendary turning into an fleshy bike*  Me: Thanks 😃 I hate it
This felt very old school when Pokemon had tons of original music tracks
I have to say, I'm really disappointed so far. With the exception of Donphan, we've already seen everything from previous trailers. I'm bored and I haven't even played the games yet.
Hey maybe in the next game you could add dialogue to your characters because almost no one wants to read a lot in a game but I do love the games either way but dialogue would be tremendously better because they actually talk
I got double pack and I'm playing Scarlett and I giving my little brother violet
Lol at least show the starters' evolutions now that everything's leaking. The past Donphan looks great. Definitely getting Scarlet 'cause I ain't giving a thing about the futuristic pokemon
I'm going to watch this trailer every day until release
besties your game is leaking HARD
BALL GUY PHONE
I'll pass. Again.   Haven't played a mainline game since gen 6.
Ed Sheeran’s in Pokémon??!!
Pikachu had its original cry!!!
Well I sure hope the leaked designs of the final evolutions are wrong but if they aren't I guess this will be the first time I just leave my starter in the pc the whole game. heck might even just release them. Sprigotito was so good and you did the one thing that pretty much everyone asked you not to do and turned in to a bipedal furry. Seriously why can't we get good starters any more?
Music sucked but glad that I got to see paradox forms of donphan.
RIP Pokémon Home. RIP National Dex. I am utterly surprised why no one here is talking about it.
I'm so excited for this game, I have a feeling this will be one of the best Pokémon games of all time. I'm excited for the future of Pokémon as a whole. from a black and white screen on a little game boy to a legit beautiful open world Pokémon experience. if open worlds are the future of Pokémon games, then I hope we get all regions in 1 game. But it will probably never happen but I just can't wait for Nov 18th. My final ratings of the game before release 100/100.
So this looked amazing, and I love Ed sheran.  But I can’t get over the fact that a series known for its amazing music paid someone else to do the music but paid for no voice acting. 😂
The leaks are real!
I don't care they didnt reavel the starters because pokemon scarlet and violet get acces to poke home day 1 and my forever partner is Gible, just gonna trade away whatever starter I get.
Hear me out we get to pick  What region we start from  give us the first 2 or even the first 4 over time give us  the rest.  I want to be abel to do all the things I seen in the show  in a game. That game done right will make BILLIONS and fans will be in love with it. And add on this  with a skill tree even the same pokemon  will feel different. With of course a anime battle style AI
The way they showed the new donphan forms was so cool
Love this, but can someone please tell me how there is a TERMINATOR DONPHAN! I am still getting Violet, but now I kinda wanna get scarlet too. I get how it could possibly be like that though the terminator donphan because it’s probably the same with wooper, it adapted to an unusual environment.
keen af
Im so exited, cant wait for Scarlet and Violet, hopefully we get news about the gen 9 anime as well
The song is not copyright is it?
A real RPG pokemon  game. I want the maps to look like I step out of the old games and into the poekmon  world. It like when we watch the show we get a feel then when the movies came out it  Expanded. Want a real big open world game.
Okay I can honestlyyy care less about Terastilization. It looks idiotic. Like all of those Pokémon are seriously going to have neck pains with that on top of them.   Those sandwiches will go to waste for me.   Donaphant 😍. That did send chills. The song 🥲.
Come on I just wanted to know if weed cat stays on all fours :c
Started out just like all the other videos, showing us things we've already seen before then just one glimpse of something new
This does feel like an adventure
Am I the only one who wants a pokemon game   that  give us that anime battle feel.
FFS just show the starter evos already
I hope we get a pokemon  game that let us choose  where we want to start from and from there be abel to really try to be pokemon  master. To have the freedom  to choose  what  Region...that's fire
I hope for gen 10 that it give us a open world  that really big and level scale
Can you  Imagine if they gave pokemon a skill tree.
Ed Sheeran 🤢
They should’ve just stopped after Gen 4. They only keep getting worse.
Anyone else digging the music? It's making me more hyped for this game! 🎵🎶🎵
Dragon tera type looks SICK! (I still like the Ghost tera hat more…)
Hope for the linking cable! As I lack people to trade with :( but these games will rock!!
That was a BEAUTIFUL trailer.
So excited!!!! Why 18 November so long???  🤣🤣🤣
Yes I'm getting the midnight release!
How dare you try to make me listen to an Ed Sheeran song. I love yall but this is just way too far.
stop releasing new game regions and pokemons. just make emerald and fire red be like pokemon arceus
trash
awful trailer with awful music
Ancient dolphin has switched me from Scarlet to Violet
Poderia ter Português Br para nós fãs de pokémon que não sabemos inglês.
How dare you try to trick me into listening to an Ed Sheeran song like Pokemon I love you but you crossed a line there.
This Ed Sheeran music video is pretty cool
The new age of pokémon is here!!!!!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
So do the starters even evolve this time?
the legends literally emerged from the hidden world lol
lets freaking go pokemon scarlet and violet are about to be fire yes sir 🔥
I question the choice of song/artist for this video. I know what that artist's songs are based on and I think it miiiight be sending the wrong message. Intentionally or not. (Why a music video that was nothing more than a summary of everything we've learned up to this point? Seems a bit strange to me and I wonder who thought this was a good idea...)  Also, I'm heavily disappointed in this Gen's designs. Been playing since Gen 1. They're trying way too hard with it, imho. Please dont dislike if you dont agree, just ignore it, block me or keep walking. But the only thing I'm looking forward to is being able to play with my gf and ride dragoncycles together. Also, sandwiches.   Le Chonk is the only one outside of the cat starter/legendary (aka dragoncycle) I'm remotely looking forward to...  But that's literally the best part of this round and maybe I'm just burnt out and wishing, as with every new generation, that this is the last game Gen they make.  Let Pokemon rest finally, Nintendo!! (And maybe let Ash finally grow up??)
Honestly, I hope the game doesn't reveal starter evos and keeps some pokemon and new things hidden so we can discover them and actually be suprised
not the ed sheeran song 😭 pokemon’s marketing has been so questionable lately…
I’m soo excited
Wtf is this garbage...my ears are bleeding
its looks ugly as fuck, but im still hopping for the best
That is very awesome and i can't wait you or other Pokemon maker put in Pokemon go and i wonder you can create new Pokemon like new snake Pokemon be ice and dark types?
Is no one going to talk about the *music*
I’m excited most excited I have been for a Pokémon Game since Sun and Moon Scarlet and Violet might be two of my favourite Pokémon games I’m can’t wait till November 18th!
First ever starters not to evolve. Game looks completely all right other than they're getting really out of hand with overpowering Pokemon at this point Mega Evolution was fine I get that Z moves was pushing it,now they are  just going way beyond what Pokemon should be.. just an old school player from red and blue days.
Just remember that on the Twitter it states that the Ancient Donphan killed a guy lol
Oh wow! The animations actually look pretty good this time!! The environments look cool too, im super hyped for this!!!!
While the music choice was great for this trailer, I wish we could've heard some in-game music for this trailer instead.
it really is amazing how much pokemon has grown i have almost all the games
1:11  Pikachu is using it's old cry instead of saying it name?!
I cant wait I'm getting the game immediately and playing it with all my friends when it comes out
I really hate the design of the new terastal forms.. random balloons or flowers on their heads? whoever approved that should be fired immediately

DONPHAN ENJOYERS UNITE LETS GOOOO
Not the Ed Sheeran 😭
The fact that they teased us with a moment that may have been perfect to reveal a starter evolution... 🥲 It hurts my soul 🥲
So it's basically Made in Abyss but child friendly. 🤔🤔🤔
I can't wait to play through this with my sister.
Yet after all these years, and despite their trailers featuring pop songs, the characters still... don't... talk.
I think the gengar was shiny
AINT NO WAY THEY PUT ED SHERON AS THE FKN MUSIC FOR A POKEMON TRAILER
Is this Ed Sheeran?
I dont care what anyone says. I think this has the potential to be the best game in the series
At first, I thought those mammoths were forms of the 3rd legendary, but turns out there paradox donphan! They look solo cool!!! Can't wait for SV!!!!
As a Dark or Ghost type user. HYDREGGION AND DRAGAPULT! heck yeah!  I can't wait to see what other past/future evolutions pop up!
Sigh Pokemon don't hit each other auto battles are dumb we don't have an evil team no over world catching sandwiches are boring terrastylazation  is stupid
The Donphant
Are the starter evos so bad they dont want to show them???
10 days left and still no starter evolutions . Hmm...
Please tell me Sprigatito doesn't stand up when it evolves just let it be a cat
Ed sheeran confirmed in Pokémon
Why do the attacks look worse than ever imo
The song is great
Can't wait!
I just realized how funny this is: "ah yes for my school project I will fix the problems with school rebels, become the best pokemon trainer in paldea and find a bunch of herbs that tons of people have tried to get but failed"
pretty epic ngl
Bro used Ed Sheeran for the trailer💀
The song is so disconnected from Pokemon....
I was scared when they started singing
PIKACHU HAS ITS ORIGINAL CRY LETS GOO
Welp… onto the leaks!
Probably just me but is no one else interested in how they have different rotom cases for if you played the past games?
This feels like an 09’ AMV
10 days until release me and my boyfriend are so excited ❤ love the trailer and the song 🥰
Beautiful  trailer  have real music  100x  Like :)
I really hope Ed Sheeran is the Paldean Champion.
The Arceus phone case actually looks really cool!!! I cant wait for the games!!
Ok that donphan is making me get scarlet that violet one looks weirf
I honestly think from what we saw of them both donphans look sick
Ok but when are the starter evolutions?
The song caught me off by suprize
Literally I cannot WAIT for this game! I’m so glad they aren’t revealing too much so you can experience new things on your own time!
W trailer! Can't wait to play!
Ed Sheeran moment
2:34 is that a Donphan new evolution 🤨 or its just it new form
Why do thus Legendary look so lame 😅
Imagine Ed Sheeran music is in this game
N-New pokemon!
The terra crystals are just like the delta species Pokémon cards
Você vai ficar com você
Ed Sheeran x pokemon again
THEY PUT DRAGAPULT AND HOUNDOOM IN LETS GOOOOO
Shit looks goofy asf 😂, sparkly pokemon now with weird shit on their heads. Just leave the formula alone you don't have to keep adding new game mechanics each damn game...the original games was the best because they didn't have stupid mechanics like Gigantamax, Dynamax, Zmoves etc that BS is not needed.
Very underwhelming trailer but it’s still cool
My man dophan got a power buff
We're 10 days before the release date, They have to show the starters evolution at some point.
pokemon just ed sheerend us
great nothing too much revealed. TY, can't wait to enjoy the game.
Ceruledge taking design cues from Durandamon (digimon).  Both literally made of swords
Stop why Ed  shearan  gfgfhdgwhd  Edit: jk the song actually fits great with the theme of the game
These games are gonna be amazing ❤💜
2:22 bruh i thought they put todoroki in the game lmfao
I feel like I'm the only one here that thinks this but...do these games seem a little all over the place? I've always loved how all of the Pokémon games have a certain theme and feel to them but I'm having a hard time grasping what that is for this game. Can anyone explain to me what's going on here? Like in Alola it was all tropical and you had the trials and mantine surfing and it all felt cohesive but I'm just so confused here. I don't mean this in a bad way I just need help understanding. If someone can explain it to me it will help me in figuring out if I want to purchase this or not. It's just we have the school theme, a future and past theme, an rpg theme with gimmighoul, a kind of Mad Max theme with Mela and team star, and the region is based on Spain but even when I first saw the Scarlet and Violet logo designs I thought it was going to be set in China. I don't know maybe it's all just me. I really wanna give these games a chance I just don't get it. The theme....someone tell me the theme! 😭
Everything looks great except the crystal hats and the scarlet bike.
Well, they’re still expecting us to choose our starter without knowing what they evolve into.
Quaquaval,meowscarada and skeledirge, those are the final evo of the starters
WHY IS ED SHEERAN SINGING
Am I the only one who thinks that the character animations look slightly weirder with each new game?
Since they haven’t shown the starters evolution I think gamefreak is hidding them on purpose so we would have to evolve them to see for ourselves what they are 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
plz change weed cat’s final evo og my god
2:32 more past and future themed stuff for the game
Pikachu got his old cry back.💀
Cool video but I could do without ed sheeran personally
Wtf the music jumpscared me
The models, dialogue, story, animations and different pokemon are all so good! I can't wait for the release.
Do we need to have both of the games to get the rotom cases? I’m hoping just 1 qwq
this game gonna be a banger
Just show the fucking starter evolutions Jesus Christ
SHOW THE STARTERS EVOS ALREADY
I legit started getting emotional over seeing the ancient donphan. I have always had a special connection with that pokemon specifically, and I don't know why. I'm so happy they're in the game, and get new forms to boot!
WOW, Ed Sheeran. I can’t believe he sang a song just for this.
So, what if the starter evolutions were version exclusives? Maybe that’s why they’re not showing them?
I’m just happy I finally get to have dragonite & Ampharos on my switch team 🔥🔥
i tried  playing this with a Lorna Shore song and it hits different. not an Ed Schwinning fan but i will say the song is aight. i can see why they chose this song and unironically it fits.
God they are just refusing to show us anything new jesus christ. At least we saw the new donphans but otherwise this was STILL 97% the same shiz
Prehistoric Donphan 😍
add ekens
im not impressed im sick if how lazy this company is, theyre holding stuff because this game is gonna be stale like all the other after the first 2 weeks
I'm looking forward for Pokémon Scarlet Version on Nintendo Switch Lite.  It will be super awesome!
And up next, Dunsparce and Shuckle will finally get a evolution 🤣
I still wonder what the pseudo will be
I know wat fuecocos evolution is
I see they took a page out of sonic and added cringe music
Let's pray this turns out a lot better than Sword & Shield ever did.
Well I was planning on getting Violet, but seeing the “ancient” version of Donphan might’ve just convinced me to go with Scarlet.
The fact that the totally addicting raids are back gave me chills
Anyone else notice the shiny tiranitar at 1:44?
Can you not catch Gimmighoul without the chest in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet!?!
I like the way Pokemon have been handling gen 9, we actually have to discover what they put into the game.
This trailer goes hard on mute🔥🔥🔥
I hope the Ed Sheeren will be in the game or the anime series theme song, the name of the song is not a coinsedense.
Oh is there a new pokemon game coming out? /j
Uniforms look lame but the game looks dope
You know what would have been a better use of marketing than getting Ed Sheeran, Pokemon Company? Actually showing more of the Gen IX Pokemon. Like, my god- this marketing campaign has slogged the whole year through, and is almost as info-dry as Sword and Shield’s. You held WAY too much back, and showing the same footage over and over again makes people think you don’t have much to show.  Next time, show half of the new Pokemon. Not one-fourth of them like Sword and Shield, and not nearly all of them like Sun and Moon- half of them (around 45). That way, it gives enough info for customers to be confident while also leaving enough to be discovered at release. As is, you honestly got what you deserved having certain “unofficial sources” show info ahead of time. There needs to be a SERIOUS shake-up in the marketing direction for future main series games.
Oh fuck, I was team Violet from the get go but I may now have to get Scarlet primarily for Ancient Donphan. Literally brought me back to my childhood seeing Donphan for the first time in Mewtwo Strikes Back. GG Gamefreak
I mean they could’ve used Lil uzi vert instead of ed sheeran
Waiting till they throw in my face that the starters have paradox forms too 💀
i really dont know which version to get
Man I want a pokemon theme song made by three 6 mafia lol
Ew
I just wanted some starter evolutions .. is that too much to ask 🥺
Can’t wait to take pics with my furry bait final evolution forms during picnics.
Pokémon really released an sfm for a trailer.
Pretty sick song! Though I was really hoping they would reveal the starter evolutions.
Ok this is hype
1:21 Are we just going to ignore the 1st evo starter and the armorouge and the legendary in this photo here? Something tells me we are getting the legendarys pretty darn early
loved the music as well!
were half way champions, half way there
literally nobody asked for Ed Sheeran
I really like the Dragon crystal crown
WHAT WAS THAT AT THE END SCENE, THE KORIADON OR MIRAIDON GOING THROUGH THE CLOUDS
I wish the background song could be sung in Spanish to better fit the regional theme
I’m hyped for this game to come out now after watching this
Ancient Donphan looks so badass!! More reasons to get Scarlet >:]
this just in: the starters don't evolve and that's why they refuse to show us evolutions
I’m hyped for the arcphone phone case haha 😅
Big W for the Scarlet enthusiasts for that ancient looking elephant that we definitely don't know anything about.
Why the terrible music?!
They are dragging out these starter evolutions!😭😭😭😭😭  I’ve been purposely not looking at spoilers for this reason.
very hyped to play! already got my preorder ready 😃
Where?
That song is great. And those Donphan varients look pretty cool.
How did Edd get into the pokemon trailer 😭
Oh my bidoof, anyone that says any negative nonsense about the game that's not the Toxic we need or want take it somewhere else cause did you see the past and future Donphan ❤️❤️ looking forward to next Friday
Bro lets pay the respects to the ppl who are avoiding the spoilers
*Trailer didn't show the three starters evolutions*  My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
I'm so hyped about this game:) Can't wait to play it!
It's almost out, they really need to tell us more about the version differences because idk which one to get
They made a point of announcing this in advance just to reveal some phone cases, the Dragon Tera hat, and... Donphan split evos? I mean, neat stuff, but I'm a little disappointed.
I hope Kid Cudi will do an awesome song for Generation 10, Like he did for the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 movie.  If not, Then that’s okay.  It not only bring hype, But also bring light and hope to everyone, Especially children in their hearts.  If Ed Sheeran can do it, So can Kid Cudi.
Turned off the music. Terrible. I hope you guys are okay with spending that money, I doubt it improved the game any... Thanks for the Arceus Phone though. I appreciate that!
Is there a Pokémon on the front of Mela’s vehicle?
This was shit. I wanted some more new info, not some shitty music video
NOT ED SHEERAN
The only thing I can say is please add more  character design options, this can include different hairstyles, colors, outfits, and body types!
SHOW US THE STARTER EVOLUTIONS YOU ABSOLUTE MANIACS
Wish we knew starter evos but this trailer is super hype
Pokemon, we need actual news for once. Please?
Not gunna lie I wasn't too interested in the game but after watching this I might actually pick it up looks pretty good
I have the game preorderd just have to wait now good luck all have a good day
If sylveon, garchomp, licaruio are in, then I’m hyped
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it!!
Honestly, the best things there is now we know what the Bug and Dragon Tera headpieces look like.
Why am I crying...? Also, why're so many folks in the Pokemon community hating Quaxly? I swear it's the Popplio incident all over again. I for 1 love Quaxly & will use it till the end.
Why did ed sheeran compose music… FOR A POKEMON GAME
Cuck trailer
What I don't like about these trailers, is that each one has like 1 thing that is new to us. They've showed the exact same things to us so much by now
Since the Paldea region is based on Spain, Portugal, And Andorra, I wonder if there’s Pokémon based on creatures from Spanish and Portuguese culture.🤔
1:11 Pikachu has its own sound back!!! This is truly a love letter to pokemon fans!
Plottwist: these starters were the first one without an evolution.
Was that paradox Donphan? the past one looks so cool! I wonder how the past Salamence looks like without wings or future Tyranitar
NIT YHE ED SHERREN
This is the first time in a long time that it’s hard to choose which version to get because both look sick
It looks like do donphan gets a spilt evolution nice
The marketing team needs a raise ❤🎉
I find they should add speech to pokemon games now we are in the time pokemon should have the characters speaking now to much reading
*E D  S H E E R A N*
I was hardcore going for Violet. But this past vs future forms might turn me off. Hoping future forms aren’t just ‘it’s robotic now.’
Ed Sheeran song in Pokémon 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Ugh, I already know this game is gonna be so easy
I'm kinda impressed that they didn't give the game away too much and it's already a week or so before release
The donphan definitely looks interesting.
That was kinda dissapointng
When we going to get voice dubbing in one of these games? Hahaha I don’t care about the graphics make the people talk so I don’t have to read!
Come on I'm just trying to see fuecocos Evo. Please lol 😆
Me begging to see the starter evolutions: Pokémon: no
Robot Donphan! Robot Donphan! Robot Donphan! 😄
this was actually so lame there were only like 2 new things in this shown for a few seconds each and an lying music wth 😭
Pokemon have come very far.   I still remember first time i got to know pokemon. My Dad bought me my gameboy colour, Pokemon red game and i started my adventure with Charmander. and i was so happy when i beat brocks onyx with it and it evolved to a Charmeleon.   i was, 5-6 years old at that time and 30 now.  I so badly want to be a kid again..❤️‍🩹
This ain't pokemon anymore..
Nice music
Fans: why is gamefreak so adamant on not showing the starter evos? What happened compared to older games?  Gamefreak: *didn't reveal the Gen 8 starters until after SwSh came out*
Ed sheeran is cannon
Man this song/music really doesn't fit a pokemon trailer.
looks so good bros!
yooo there is olive oil on the table at 1:25 RIP SMOLIV ;(
Flying dedenne 😭😍
Trailer goes hard on mute 🔥
When are you guys show the starters final Evolutions trailer? Please answer
I kinda don't want to watch the rest of the video because of the stupid music
I haven't been the biggest fa of these games so far, but this trailer did make them look really charming and fun.
1:11 Pikachu is now doing a regular Pokémon cry now  Finally, some equality around here!
This is so beautiful and amazing.
NOT EDSHEERAN HELPPPP
Still no rock/ghost pokemon 😔
Just pre ordered the double pack yesterday and I am so unbelievably excited to play them. I’ve never gotten both games in a generation before but this time something just feels different and I feel like it’s gonna definitely be worth it. I hope all my fellow trainers here have a great time playing the game when it comes out!
So paradox forms have been confirmed for one Pokemon. Paradox forms have been verified. I will take all the 'I told you so's now. I love the music; I wonder if it will be the theme song for this series. Did we have other videos like this, where it was a semi-music video?
Very aesthetically pleasing to watch and it has me quite excited for the games. I couldn't pick which one i wanted more, so I asked my parents to get me one or both for my birthday. Since my birthday is a few days before the release, they can pick one for me and I get to play it on release when I visit them to celebrate my birthday.   I'm certainly glad they don't release these games during the summer, otherwise I'd have to buy them from my savings instead 😂  Also, Ed Sheeran's song fits very well with the visuals of this trailer.
Wtf they got ed sheeran in on this. Great song and visuals too, almost makes you nostalgic for something that hasn't even come out yet. Gets me more excited for its release.
If there's one thing I took from this trailer, it's that Scarlet and Violet is more 'slice of life' than just becoming champion, or defeating an organization, or hunting after legendary pokemon. It's just a trainer, and their lifelong buddies... and honestly, that makes me really happy.
Ed Sheran’s music killed this trailer for me personally.
Why am I emotional ;0;
;w; gay song
What the sparkling attacks?
Is this choice of song hinting towards a Celesteela return?
i saw it muted, cants stand that singer
I like how the attack animations look like they actually connect now.
Dangit I don't want to look up the pokedex or anything because I don't want to be spoiled on anything but I might have to
I was 13 when I first started playing Pokemon red/blue and I have never stopped buying and playing the Pokemon games. It amazing to see how far the journey has gone. The Pokemon games got me thru rough patches in my life. Thank you gamefreak and Nintendo for a game series that has warmed my heart like no other.
I am soo glad to see that the grafics are a lot better then they where first…
Hey I know this song it’s the song that Ed sheeran sung about Pokémon
Is this the credits song, or is there something more to this video than that?
I don‘t get how to get the rotom cases
Compare to previous trailers this one falls behind. It felt more like a montage then a actual trailer :/
theres something depressing about game freak treating two rando normal ass elephant pokemon with more mystery and intrique than the box legendaries.
Took me a little while to realise that this is not a normal trailer but a music video. Ok but I expected more actual info
It seems they removed the hidden power move just to sell this games one gimmick.
I had to mute the video bc of that awful singer, ears bleeding
downvoted for cringe music.
Using the Ed Sharon song to promote the new trailer was an awesome choice
Please don't play Ed Sheeran again
Why is no one talking about the abomination of music in this?! Pokemon has always used its own music, now they've got that ginger dick making a shitty song for them? Not cool
i was hoping for the starters evolutions   but this video is done beautiful! i love the song in it
I love Pokémon so much.
Man this game is looking incredible. I can't wait to grab my chili gator and take him on adventures 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Pokémon and fire emblem developers: better gameplay, better graphics? Best we can do is school and face petting
That's it? Cool vid sure. But you gave us nothing. What about breeding is it gone? If so you just lost like 60% of the players who enjoy that.
Reading these comments reminded me that most of the pokemon fan base is a bunch of soft as baby shit weebs. People talking about crying over a video game trailer?
Not a fan of the song. Awesome footage though.
Please for the love of god release the starter evos
Everyone is talking about the new stuff but can you believe it guys? Pikachu has his old cry back!
Donphan evo
Didn’t think the tail would roll up 😂
Pokemon is officially in its quantity over quality era. Be prepared for ugly and rushed games
That showed absolutely nothing,  I saw more about the game on Twitter yesterday
10 Days guys!!!
Primal donphan hits hard though
Broski failed the nuzlocke on route 1
Literally still waiting for the starter evolutions. When are they going to release themmm
I get some people might be upset about not seeing some of their expected evolutions such as the starters etc.. It's cool not seeing many features of the game in my opinion. It leaves so much more fun things to discover 😁
Is it just me or does anybody else think that car the evil team girl is standing on is a Pokémon?
Can we see the starter evolutions for christ sake
pls give more info about the elephants
These trailers with full songs are always fantastic. Past and future forms of Donphan look amazing!
DRAGAPULT LETS GOOOOOOO
Where's the PIKA?!?! 😭😭😭😭
Yea... that was the gayest video ever, was expecting the starter evolutions & old skool pokemon battle musik.
I'm thinking the starters Terra type will just be locked to their type
Downvoted for not using actual pokemon music and instead using this garbage
gotta admit, this is the kinda trailer a new pokemon game needs SO HYPIN and Givin Goosebumps !
You know, I kinda like this mystery with the starter evos, it’s making me excited
I’m sorry but Ed Sheeran was just the worst pick
At this point, maybe the starters are just Single Stage Pokemon. Wouldn't THAT be a curveball?
LETS GO NEW FORMS FOR MY FAVORITE POKEMON
Awesome!! ^^
They really just made an AMV and called it a trailer
hope they wont add pronounce like the sims 4 that would be cringe and embarassing
What is this terrible music?
Shame about the song.
I’m both super excited and kinda mad, if only bc I just had to cancel my debit card due to a fraud charge, and I don’t know if the new one will be here in time for my preorder to go through. Here’s hoping, though.   Also, please just show us the starter evos gamefreak!
Yo, Staraptor! Also the new Donphan forms are neat.
This all looks like Yu-Gi-Oh Season 1 ont the island with other players. The character presenting all this in red reminds me of Pegasus lol
I am literally crying I am so excited.
Can't wait to emulate this on my PC
How i wish i had a nintendo switch now 🥲
The games look amazing!
this made me more hype
I pissed my pants this song scared me i was not ready
this game looks incredible
Geeez nintendo, show some freaking more pokemon will ya, before the leakers leak everything anyway....
Could they have picked a gayer song
theyre really leaving the starter evolutions for last just to tease us huh
This video made me cry!
who tf chose this music over any existing pokemon song 😂
WARNING! CONSTANT EDRAPE 🤢 Also, please stop with CHARIZARD 🙃🙃😡😡😡😡
This trailer is really good and I like the song that went with it can't wait until the 18th!!
dude, ancient versions of pokemon will look so much better but I wanted Violet for Ceruledge… But if I end up picking fuecoco, then the Ceruledge is pointless. But what about second run of the game. Aaaaaaah
Pikachu doesn't speak Pika in this game? sad
This song is a bangwr
I love d song
The donphan forms look good 👍
I hope that I'll like the game. Like I've been trashing on it, but I want to like it :(
This video is best left on mute. Keep Ed Sheeran away from Pokémon -_- bad enough he was on GoT
Watching an official Pokémon trailer and hearing Sheeran's lyrics "you make me feel like my troubled heart is a million miles away" hits so hard—thank you for everything you've done for me over the generations, you glorious beast.
Doniphan has been turned into a cyborg in the future 😲
Ah yes Koraidonphan and Miraidonphan.
Could we get IRL Rotom phone cases
Ok, so, where are the Paldean starter evolutions? And what about the Paradox Donphan?
Thanks for confirming the leaks pokemon
And that’s why everything is leaking today 😐
Contrary to popular opinion, I’m glad they didn’t reveal the starter evolutions. It’s more fun when you find out for yourself. Also, that catching animation was dope.
I've never been so excited for phone cases XD
1:11 is that pikachus original cry
Why is Pokémon using gospel music ahaha
Maybe future donphan is not actually a donphan but a manmade Pokemon based on it 🤔🤔🤔
WHAT ARE THE STARTER EVOS
That's it? That's the latest Pokémon upload? THAT WAS JUST A GODAWFUL SINGER USING A TRAILER FOR A MUSIC VIDEO!!!
1:58 jolteon is like "its too early for this energy yall"🤣😮‍💨
Man I got the chills watching this
I love the idea of a book outlining the paradox pokemon. That really adds a feeling of wonder and history to the game. Thats exciting.
I so can't wait to start my paldea region journey
I LOVE 🥰🥰🥰
Just tell us the starter evolutions for the love of fuck!
Just tell us the starter evolutions for the love of fuck!
To be honest, I’m a little disappointed. I wanted to see the starters evolved forms. Although, it’s almost time for the games to come out, if they want to keep the starters evolutions a surprise, I will respect that.
Donphan gang! 😍
This trailer looks like it was the end o of Pokemon series
I really feel like open world pokemon is a next-gen idea on current gen consoles.
I ❤❤❤ this music.
Also, Morrissey in this game, the more disappointed I am with the redesign. They finally hit the right notes with legends Arceus, and then threw it away for generic modeling of the human characters. In order looks like Pokémon it’s an awkward rebranding. My point is oval > circle.
What a fire trailer. Looking forward to the games!
Excited for past forms. Future forms looking like robots though is just too much, I don't like it. Robot Pokémon? Really?
Why is nobody talking about old Pikachu's cry? It's so nostalgic and I'm so happy they added it back again. 1:11
I still can't get over the ugly cristal forms y couldn't they stick to the mega evolution. I hope there is a way to turn of that game mechanism.
I think this is the first time I've heard a song by Ed Sheeran.
I am soooo hyped for this game!
Im not expecting them to show us the starter evolutions galar didnt do it but the new donphan looks so cool i hope there’s different outfits besides uniforms
Can we please just get the Pokédex already!?
I’m hoping we get a regional bird
Meh
Finally get another trailer and it’s an Ed Sheeran song over 95% of clips we have already seen
The two pokemon that they showed as a sketch. Kind of look like Donphan
I love this Ed Sheeran song better than the Post Malone and Katy Perry ones. By far, the best one ❤️❤️❤️
Sword and shield had better legendaries
looks pretty clean
Once again no starter evolutions
So we get ancient donphan and robo donphan?
probably the best trailer they’ve ever released, IM SO HYPED
why do we have ed sheeran music when we have the god that is TOBY FOX composing these games? feel like he could've made more fitting music...
This music reminds me of CCM in the worst way. If you know you know. It also feels completely disconnected with the game series. This reminds me of those weird fan made music videos from back in the day. There’s a total energy and rhythm mismatch between the music and the subject matter moving on screen. Further, it has zero energy. It just feels melancholy. This is a Pokémon game you explore world with all these exciting creatures and go on adventures and have dramatic battles. this music feels like it was picked out by a corporate board under consultation to choose the least offending to a generic market as possible. So instead of having anything that thrills the listener, it serves a function as glossy cardboard box with the wrong image printed on the box.
This just hyped my day up!!! I'm so excited for this new generation!
Is it just me or was that growlithe shiny
I’m begging I just want the starter evos
Omg donphan!!!!!!!
The new scarlet Donphan look sick. RIP violet pokemon trainers
I wasn’t sure if I was going to buy this but something about this video is triggering my inner child to come out with such excitement and enthusiasm to want to play it. I think I’m going to pick up my own copy.
Hmm. I have to say. Scarlet/Violet trailers aren't as hype as trailers for Sword/Shield.   The song used for Sword/Shield just creates more hype. And the transition to Zacian and Zamazenta at the end of the trailer was *chef's kiss.*   Trailer is still good, but I guess I was expecting hype like Sword/Shield trailer did for me. Lol
Does this song make anybody else emotional? Just me? Aight 🫠
I wish i could see Sprigatitos evolutions as its a cute kitty cat
I’m sorry but this looks terrible as a 29 yo long time fan.
Its almost time to play y'all! Just gotta wait a little bit longer 😭😭 I'm so excited !!
Yeah gamefreak and pokemon have once again let me down with this, non of this is new or even exciting, we get a compilation of all the past trailers in one with a song from Ed boi.. smh yall really are dropping the ball big time here
All aboard the hype train!! Chooochoooo!! 🚆 🚉 🚄 🚋 🚈 🚅 🚆 🚉
No surprise we still haven't gotten any starter evos yet, unfortunately. Donphan variants look exciting though
C'mon Pokemon Company, I'd rather here ingame music than Ed :(
I wonder if the fact that there seem to be a lot of Gen 2 Pokemon and new Gen 2 evolutions means the Johto let’s go game or remake could be round the corner?
Please stop making games
This trailer was so well done. Really enjoyed it 🌞
Trigger Warning: Ed Sheeran
Anyone listen on mute 🫠
Gardevoir deserves a new variant. Same for Lucario
I've been a fan of Pokémon for all of my life
did they like have to put ed sheeran on this
Hol up! There was this YouTuber who guessed the whole past and future gimmick!
I hate college cuz i hardly have time to play this fun game
Inevitably, people are going to find something to complain about this trailer.
awesomeeeeeeee
Koraidon looking good as always. Miraidon looking alright for once.
Damn I guess everyone is a Donphan fan
ed sheran is why ill be skipping gen 9.
Wait... instead of getting a cool Pokemon... you get a phone case???? I feel cheated a bit...
Where garchomp
I take back all the hate I had. This turned out looking great! 👌 I was so worried after SWSH & PLA. But this looks great!
Yooooooooo my boy donphan finally got an evo
I can’t wait next week can’t come soon enough
2:56 Gengar’s 3D model makes it look like it’s dancing to the music.
This trailer was better muted :)
Song doesn't fit
Why do they have wheels if they can fly?
I was wanting to see starter evolutions, but I got an Ed Shereen music video instead...
Incredible song and an amazing trailer too, I am looking forward to how all certain Pokémon look in their Past and Future forms
Ok but mecha ttar when
This close to launch and we still have no idea what the starter evolutions look like,do they even have any?
what was the point in this trailer other than pushing that mediocre singer again?
Tf is this cringe
STILL NO DUNSPARCE EVO
wtf is this song? lol
0:38 Mew confirmed under the truck
We want the starter evolutions
2:10 Is that truck.. or maybe the engine.. a Pokemon? 🤨🤨🤨
I was wondering if we were going to get a trailer with this song since it is supposed to play in game
Show the start evolutions please!
Wasn't expecting this music tbh
Saw a teeny tiny baby litleo <3. My opinion on these games just did a 180.
Play muted. You're welcome.
Not Ed Sheeran 😭
Love this 💕
Yall didnt have to put Sheeran in this.
I wanna know what song that was tbh
We’re about to see the death of Pokémon.
Way to make a grown man cry Pokémon
Caaaan anyone explain to me WHERE ARE THE DAMM STARTER EVOLUTIONS?
WHOA, just WHOA! Pokemon Company is definitely pushing their marketing to another level with this trailer, they made a full-on music video of their game with a song that feels like it represents everything PERFECTLY!!!
I've been playing Pokémon since the original Red, and I still get so weepy-eyed and excited whenever a new game comes out. I feel like a kid going on their first Pokémon adventure all over again! I can hardly wait to play with the new Pokémon and the regional redesigns. Though I'm for sure gonna snag a Gengar, I've had one every generation I could get my hands on one.
Starter evolutions whennnnn?!??
I know this will sound sappy, but did anyone else kinda get teary from nostalgia somehow?  I’m really excited for the game. I don’t know, it’s just a thing people who have always been with something they’ve grown up with can kind of feel, so make fun or whatever but if you know what I mean, you get it.
Give miltank a new form as well!!
Rejoice my brothers and sisters, for it is almost time for us to start a new, a new life of Pokémon. A new world to explore. New troubles to conquer and over come. A new adventure in the world of Pokémon!
This song is amazing
I was gonna have fuecoco for scarlet but I don't know who to pick for violet. Unless I get both🐈🦆🐊
This feels like one of those "while I play unfitting music" memes.
Not gonna lie, but that hole at the end reminded me of Made in Abyss
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
There is no way they got an Ed Sheeran song in a Pokemon trailer
Disappointing as hell.....
Donphan it's your time to shine
Nah they killed the game its suck, ehat in the hell still makes sense on rhis game for real…
CAN'T WAIT
Why ed sheeran tho
I really miss the basic instrumental music
I need the starter evoletions
Yoooo past and future varients on pokes!?
Phone case dlc les go
We were scammed with the Violet version of Donphan. The Scarlet one is so much better.
Buizel i love you!!!! 🦦
The fact that the game comes out in two weeks and we still don’t know what the starter evolutions are, and you make a 3 minute trailer that does absolutely nothing but hint at new donphan forms is ridiculous. Starter evolutions are how some people decide what starter they are going to pick so not revealing them at all is absurd
The hype is real
Phanpy was my favorite Pokemon. But good God does the future dophan look like trash!
Felt like I was watching an AMV
can we have it without the annoying guy in the background pls
Uhhh so is there still no voice acting? At least the graphics look better… also cool Future and Past Pokémon concept!
God I hope this one isn't as disappointing as swsh
Hearing Ed Sheeran all of a sudden was like a punch in the face
really digging the lcd screen eyes that the future forms seem to have, given that miraidon is probably a paradox form of cyclizar
Please animate the pokeballs in the raid dens to be whatever we throw at the raid boss.
They nerfed Pikachu back to its OG cry 🤦🏽‍♂️
The first official reveal of Paradox pokemon. Based. 2:30
I just wanna know if I'm changing mind on the starters or not.... I choose when it gets announced. And I repick depending on w/e the starter evolutions is. Unfortunate
Nah I'm about to cry 😭
I have to say, the ed sheeran + selfie + anime style just doesn't suit me. At least it's a pokémon game, and in the end i'll be breeding and battling so i don't have to care about the story that much.
we're getting another johto game this gen. mark my word, i will die on this hill
if we never get a new eevee or actual choices in a pokemon game (REAL RPG elements) I just cant bring myself to play. Have this huge world finally but you still gonna walk a fairly linear path. So disappointing that Game Freak keeps holding back
Yep, that's what we all think of when we see Pokemon. Ed Sheeran...
I always thought paradox forms were just a myth spread by fans, cause we haven't seen them till now!
I'm actually really glad they didn't spoil too much. I want that "wow" feeling in Pokémon when you discover new things.
I’m looking forward to playing Violet and all the new customizable features.
PAST AND FUTURE DONPHAN! WOOOO! :u
Heck yes the vibe was amazing!
God this is gonna suck
For the first time in a Pokémon game I don't know which version to get :(
When the song started I joked "Why the fuck is there a diet ed sheeran wannabe song in this pokemon trailer" and THEN IT TURNS OUT IT WAS ED SHEERAN LMAO
Like come Pokémon give us the starter evolution already the game is going to be released next Friday and still nothing on evolution of the starter 😡😡😡
Coolio we see Donphan has 2 variants past and future forms.
honestly… that was SO BEYOND CUTE, that i can’t even be any amount of salty about not getting starter evolutions. 😅 i’ve accepted my fate at this point that it will more than likely be a surprise.   i’m probably gonna choose sprigatito, (even though quaxly is a very close second) and if she’s terrifying and menacing walking around on two legs when she evolves (just like how i sadly felt about delphox for a long time 🥲), then i will love her freaky looking self just the same lmao.💙
the music just does not fit the video AT ALL
Un amv des années 2000
Please...no more Ed Sheeran
Yawn 🥱
Calling all trainers! What was your first pokemon game? Mine was sapphire.
An incredible trailer, great job.
Music was unnecessary, use a better artist next time like lilbootycall
Música ruim
Some people are saying the game is bad but I want to judge by myself !
We are just a week away now IM HYPED
Looks really cool, though I wish there was either voice acting or grunts like in BOTW so dialogue wouldn’t be so silent
i love the song used whats it called
who else shouted wth when ed sheeren started playing
seeing this makes me even more hyped for the games then before,I can't wait for next week I'm getting both games,I love that they did this knowing that people will get hyped for the games
The fuck Ed doing in my Pokémon game
You can’t deny Ed is an amazing singer
DONPHAN LETS GO
Really into the ideas of past future versions of Pokemon. I like that Donphan has visible fur like a mammoth.
This is a great video
Muito bom o vídeo e a música 👏🇧🇷♥️!
This looks like a fan creation
Ed Sheeran's song made this better👍
OMG this made me cry with excitement. Pokemon We're proud of how far you've come, like this is amazing and Im soooo happy for this new game.
Another weak trailer with only one new information yikes...
ALL THAT AND NO STARTER EVOLUTIONS????
3:24 for crater
Ha.  Koraidonphan and Moraidonphan.
Man the protagonists' designs are sooo much better now
This music? Awful, just awful. What have the Pokémon company done...
I hope they keep the starters a secret 🙏🏻 this would make it sooo much more interesting then it already is, not knowing what you’re getting, additionally a bigger reason to play it again or trade with others.
So close yet still somewhat far, can't wait to play these games. I'm happy I pre ordered Violet a month and a half ago, I'm super excited.
This was so good. I really can't wait for these games
I havent been this hyped for a pokemon game since i was a child! This looks amazing, and i really hope this game proves to be a breathe of fresh air for this franchise.
Koraidonphan and Miraidonphan look AMAZING
Ok the more I see the duck starter the more it’s growing on me. It was my least favorite of the three but I’m now really debating on choosing it
This song choice feels awkward...
HOLD ON WHAT HAPPENED TO DONPHAN????
When scarlet and violet get to transfer pokemon from and to home imma transfer a few pokemon over
How have you still not released the starter evolutions. I’m convinced they don’t exist at this point
Tá chegando o dia! Ansiedade a mil :)
I hope there are more new pokemons than this… None of them interests me except the starter grass cat. Their designs are very dull.
I don't want to get my hopes up as I haven't been able to finish the last few Pokémon games and my love for the franchise was more nostalgic rather than love for the recent games. This game actually looks like some passion was put into it. I don't want to be excited but I can't help but have some hope for this game.
We all laughed when yugioh was on motorcycles, now look at pokemon lol
Ahhhh I absolutely cannot wait!! This was a great final trailer (well what I’m assuming is the final one anyway) and of course you had to play Celestials for it lol I’m actually obsessed with that song!
Stop calling the new Pokémon Donphan, the ancient one is call Colmilargo and the robot one name is Ferrodada
So an annoying song and one teensy sliver of new information. Ughhhhhhhh can they please just release the final forms of the starters already!!!!
What if the Starter Trio gets Ancient and Future forms? Thus why they haven’t been revealed yet. 🤔
This promo song is lit
[SPOILERS]⚠⚠⚠⚠  The pokemon which have the past/future forms are called "paradox forms", the pokemon which will get these forms are:    Past form:(with typing assumptions)  Jigglypuff-fairy/fighting Amogus-i mean amoongus(grass/dragon)  Volcarona-bug/fighting Salamence-dark/dragon Misdreavus-Ghost/Fairy Magneton-Electric/Dragon And Suicune which is DLC  Future forms: Deliberd-Ice/water???  Donphan-Ground/Electric Gallade-Fairy/Fighting Volcarona-Fire/Poison Tyranitar-Dark/Electric Hariyama-Fighting/Electric Hydreigon-Flying/Dark And virizion which is also DLC  New evos: Primeape-Fighting/Ghost Wooper-Poison/Ground Girafarig-Farigiraf-psychic/normal Dunsparce-normal Bisharp-Steel/Dark  Also tentacool will get something like diglett did with wiglett.  RegionalForms: only wooper and 3 different tauros types.
My one complaint is the song. Didn't make this feel like a Pokémon trailer more like a fan AMV. But I did like showing a fully evolved team EXECPT FOR THE STARTER. Why are you hiding the start evolutions?
Forcibly enslave free animals and make them hurt each other until they faint! :D
It's weird that the Pokemon company thinks Quaxly is going to be used
Route 01 Theme - Bad Habits, Ed Sheeran
Theres something so.. how to train your dragons-like feeling to this...
Paradox forms confirmed
this is the pokemon game they wanted to bring to the switch back in 2017
I can't believe they added so much extra content to Sandwich Making Simulator, nice.
Nintendo, please, for the love of Hylia NEVER use Ed Sheeran's music to promote your beloved franchises again.  the trailer looks great but i have to mute it because i cant stand Sheeran and his one-note-only-ever-wites-shitty-love-songs shtick.
Ok, trailer was cool.  But Pikachu and Eevee having their basic cries again?!  Thats the good stuff!
Has anyone noticed is Koraidon or Miraidon faster? I feel like K is slower but I'm not sure
We need more new Pokémon. And not the same one.
Bro where the fuck is final evolution for starters DO YOUR FUCKING TRAILERS LIKE ARCEUS THEN SHAVE GRAY OUT BUT ALWAYS SHOW THEM
future donphan makes me uncomfortable
I like Pokemon ever since day one. But Im no longer a Kid. Can Pokemon grow up! Too
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
mute 🔇
So im guessing that we will not know what the starter evolutions will look like until the game releases
Ngl I think this Ed Sheeran song is fire.
10 days, boys. We just gotta wait a little bit longer. Also, I agree with most people here, that ancient Donphan looks nice.
I just bought the Celestial song. Thumbs up for Ed Sheeran, everyone!
National Dex please.....
Ok, just take my money already.
Big fan of the part where Lucario gets knocked out. Hate that guy!!
Disappointing
Damn it, why Ed Sheeran gotta be playing with my heart strings to this amazing trailer?
Hey Pokemon Company, this would've been a GREAT trailer three months ago, NOT NINE DAYS BEFORE RELEASE. Show us NEW mons! Not just gen2 forms!
Ed better get all the money they make for making promoting this game more fun
Do the starters even like evolve? I would expect at least their midstages by now
WHY ED SHEERAN????
Omg different forms of Donphan!  Also love the ghost love in this gen, so glad Dragapult is in.   So hyped to play this game soon!
I am so hyped!!! This makes me want the game as soon as it comes to the store!!!! Also, perfect song!!!
We need new eeveelutions. Bug, dragon, and ghost-types.
The new pokemon look amazing, don't get me wrong. However, teasing a trailer with almost no new info is a real let down. Kind of disappointed and not looking anymore forward to the game.
This was a pretty okay music video
Oooo, the phone case thing is cool
EWWW WAS THAT A FUCKING PAWMI EVO
I preordered Pokémon scarlet and violet And I can wait😊😊😊
this has gotta be the worst song ive ever heard in my life
This is why I’m getting Pokémon Scarlet
So wait about the starter Pokemon Evolution
Ugh, Ed Sheeran is the definition of mediocrity. I hope that doesn't reflect in this game
Dislike song  it ruined the Pokemon experience.
Song lyrics check out
im not gonna be able to beat this withthe knowledge that ed sheeran will play at the end, sound coming out of nowhere like an ancient god speaking to us. im scared
The first modern titles that never revealed the evolution of the starter Pokémon
I did not consent for ed Sheeran
Also I will say that the pandemic did help this game a lot. It gave everyone at GameFreak a much needed break since they were churning out games year after year. (Please don't mistake my excitement for how horrible the pandemic was and how many lives were lost. I lost a couple members of my family so im not saying im happy the pandemic happened.)
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
this is the most obnoxious thing ive ever experienced in my life
I cried watching this. This year the police got called on me by my boss because she called me and heard my mom screaming at me. They put me in a psych ward for no reason and I met a girl who tried to kill herself but we became friends and I fell in love. Then I came home and all my money was stolen by my mom's boyfriend, and I was mad, and I got sent to jail. And there I met the guy that made that girl that way. And he was stalking me, and tortured me, and kept me awake for 5 days. I tore my ligaments in my knee getting out of bed and now I am in constant pain. I saw this trailer today, and it reminded me of how much I love my pets and how Pokemon has always been there for me. Pokemon has always been something that's made me feel like my troubled heart is a million miles away. I'm just trying to hold out until this game comes out.
I love Pokémon so much ❤ can’t believe I’ve been playing this since the beginning and still get this excited for the games
Why the song?
Pokémo-torcycles? This is silly
All my selfies are gonna be with evvee xD
When does this game come out there’s only been 1million ads for it
stop showin us so many frickin new pokemon in these trailers, leave some for us to discover! the only mons we shoulda been told about for a while now is the starter evos and yall STILL havent told us that for some stupid reason >_<
Imagine after becoming a champion an edsheeran song plays.
Omg i think I just figured out the plot of Donphan! In real life scientists are trying to resurrect the wooly mammoth, and in the game it appears scientists resurrected an ancient pokemon but changed it to a robotic form. Maybe that's where GameFreak got the idea from???
Greninja? Where are you? 🥺
What a freaking good trailer! 😭
PROTO AND NEO FORMS ARE CANON LETS GOOO!!!!
Did they actually change pikachus sound back?!❤️
For the first time since Gen 1 I feel literally 0 hype about Pokemon
Only issue was Ed Sheeren. Other than that, great trailer
My birthday = release date! 😎 Can't wait!
The only thing missing is a new a *EEVEELUTION*
Two regional forms for a single Pokémon? Awesome! I really like the past Donphan, and I can't wait for the game to release!
Fuck dragapult is back
Whoa
Now we're cooking 🔥
I really wonder what GF is gonna do next. Maybe a new legends game set in unova would be cool
ED SHEERAM
With how many Pokemon games that keep coming out in such little time makes me worry about the people making these games. They're surely over worked at this rate.
The song in the trailer sounded neat. I’m looking forward to playing the new games.
i wasn't ready to feel
I'm still hoping for new eeveelution...
Where did they get the meats?? I hope thats not milktank meat
You did not have to force us to listen to this Ed Sheeran song 😴
I was hopin for a good trailer
Something about this trailer just oozes confidence. They know what they have. These are gonna be good
That new Donphan 😁
I almost shed a tear. Also, super excited!
I cant hyppe for a New gen Pokemon since XY and Oras. I dont like SM ,USUM,SwSH(the only one i buy),LPLE,BDSP,PLA. I hope Game freak make something good in BW remake or GS remake and maybe i got buy a pokemon game.
I dont like shereen's voice on Pokemon... they should bring the singer who sang in gen 1
New versions of Donphan looks dope. Can’t wait for the 18th :) Perfect soundtrack used too 👌🏻
Ed Sheeran op
2:07 is the best timing ever
a week and 3 days, man how time flies right by. feels like only yesterday we were questioning if the first trailer was Detective Pikachu 2 😄
I LOVED this trailer! The song really fits the vibe and makes me excited to play this game more then any other Pokémon game in the past! I cant wait for it to come out it feels like the 18 is miles away!!!
Plot Twist : the starters don't have any evolution :D
I have a question about the ending frame: what happens if I have ALL of the games?
Tbh the last switch game I played was Pokemon legends, I'm finally gonna use it again when this drops, should be a good bday gift as well! Haha
Great song Ed
Wouldn’t it be cool if the starters had a final evo for a past and future variant?  Like their final evo depended on that?
I have chills!! 🥰🥰 I can’t wait!!
I'm quite happy that the Dragapult line is back. Also the fact the Riolu line is around is great too.
This is so embarrassing
I’ll be honest, I’m glad we weren’t shown the starter evolutions. It’s going to be a nice surprise for all of us
Okay but what's the Japanese version of this song
Music was terrible. Pokemon used to be known for having great music.
Glad to see the Pokemon company is finally getting more into the modern future it's some progress thumbs up 👍 long way to go.
Ed Sheeran - decent high note I guess, but your songwriting really leaves something to be desired here!
So... past forms. Does that mean we can get the Legends Arceus Pokemon forms? because they are from the past?
This is just the same shit we've seen except with a gay song this time
Quase chorei
Oh, this is making me feel things I haven't felt since Smash Ultimate.
Wtf, I did not expect Ed sheiran
i almost cried when celestial played i thought it was just fanmade
Sandwich
I couldn’t get the code for marshadow at two different target locations and I wonder why Pokémon forced people in the USA 🇺🇸 to go there to get a free code target doesn’t distribute the codes fairly and most of the time they would with give them away in bulk or throw them away and people like me who couldn’t show up right away won’t get a code GameStop is allot better at distributing codes from Pokémon and I hope they see this comment and learn not to use target in the future for the fans here in the USA 🇺🇸
I wanna know why the bread still looks like a turd 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nice video
Paradox, more like para-sucks
Glad they didn't show starter evolutions. Tired of people crying about not seeing the whole damn pokedex. Play the game, get surprised and catch em all!
Huh, didn't expect to be subjected to Ed Sheeran music today.
I didn't expect the singing lol
Damn this Ed Sheeran song is fire on mute
Who’s buying Scarlet so we can trade Donphans!!
If only the game wasn't held back by the switch's hardware.
For once in my life i feel happiness fill my core this week. For almost 3 years ive been in a house but now.. its time for the world to be rid of the virus that once locked us in houses and seperated many and ended many lives. We can finally feel the feeling of true happiness go back to the way its been before 2020.
And once again, a video game from the most successful and lucrative media franchise of all time doesn't bother to put voice acting in despite knowing they'll turn massive amounts of profit  The sheer laziness of the pokemon company
Ed Sheeran jumpscare
Please be a national dex
Love this video 😍
We only 10 days always guys!!!
Ed Sheeran huh?
Game looks good
How does it keep getting more exiting!
JUST SHOW ME THE EVOLUTIONS!!!!!
Donphan was all the way the first pokemon movie he deserves a evolution
i wonder how big the pokedex is? as there is an awful lot of pokemon from previous gens... which is great but seeing as this is gen 9 im hoping for at least 100+ new pokemon!
Are you fucking serious? Still no starter evolutions?
As the days get closer it feels like it’s taking forever to get here 😭
that is... very close
Where are the starter evolutions were getting too close to release date without them
People literally complaining about not seeing evos when all the starter evos were literally leaked yesterday. Sprigatito IS bipdebal and by far the worst design. Fuecocos looks really good. Quaxly is giving that water fighting pony legendary dog deer thing vibes. Forgot its name.
When you love the context of the past but prefer purple
Who gave this singer a mic?
idk these games look so trash
man what is this. why are they using a pop song in a gameplay trailer
The songs not bad Also pokemon needs voice acting  Can we get that in the future please
Wonder how the Donphan variants will work. Is it going to be sort of like version exclusive evolutions?
Hype 👇       God LOVED YOU so MUCH that He sent His only son to die In YOUR PLACE so you won't have to die under Gods judgement but live forever IF you fully trust in Jesus. Please repent from thinking wickedness🙏🙏🙏
Ed sheeran moment
Who else had to watch this muted?
Fuck u pokemon
Very disappointing that there still isn’t voice acting for mainline games when the mobile gacha game has pretty good voice acting.
Song does not go with the trailer at all
crazi
i respect how adamant they are to give us full length trailers with literally less than one second of new info, like solid prank u got me
They did not just use an ed Sheeran song
The song makes it even better
This shit ain't pokemon no more
Why not to make this more popular add a Furret in.
NOT TJE ED SHEERAN SONG IM DONE HELP
I only hope the actual gameplay looks as a amazing as what we saw in this trailer, because the visuals here were absolutely stunning! I especially love how expressive the characters are now, having dynamic facial expressions and even entire gestures to reflect their moods. Same for the Pokémon, it looks like the animation team was on top of it this time and I’m all for it. I hope those animators got paid incredibly well and weren’t put on dangerous crunch time to get something so beautiful put together for us
I am so HYPED
It feels like they are actually trying to hype the game up not by it just being a new region but by it being a pokemon game. They may not have made a region only filled with new pokemon but with ~900 (excluding legendaries) they are allowed to pick and choose a handful and still say "Hey look at what makes this a new game" and everyone's not leaking the full game 60 days before release
Ed Sheeran in a Pokémon commercial…I’ll admit, I didn’t have that on my 2022 bingo card…
. . . s t a r t e r . . . that music is actually good for ed Sheeran tho.  ((I prefer Iron Tread Donphan but I’m getting the double pack so I’ll get both! The names for the Donphan are Great Tusk (Past/Ancient), and Iron Treads (Future)
ya know, Ed Sheeran song are okayish
Dragapult!!!! Omg!!! I can bring over my shiny pult❤
There is nothing on the paldean donphan on the official website
Chills
I’m hoping I don’t get spoiled before the games come out. I want to discover everything! I’ll be like a child again playing Pokémon blue for the first time.
Waiting until we get confirmation of all mons coded in, and battle frontier + megas, before getting the game
AYO POKEMON chill!! Making me cry so freaking beautiful 😍
Scarlet or violet?
Bro I'm like I don't want to watch the leak and then to get this for the trailer 😫
The day before SV are released I'll take the driving exam, the excitement drowns the anxiety, so I'm sure I'll surpass it!
bruh i got chills watching all this with that song XD
Gotta catch ‘em all 🔥🔥
Never in all my years of playing these games has a final trailer caused the amount of excitement in me that this one did. The song choice was excellent, I think it was the best one recorded for the anniversary album.
I’m emotionally damaged from seeing fuecoco get knocked out
lol, who the heck chose this music?
Guys call me crazy but I think that we might end up going on a treasure hunt
That was heartwarming ngl
Is it weird that the characters is traveling around the region,  defeating gym leaders and saving the world while wearing sch uniform make that makes sense
Ugly box art legends, barely any information about the games, and worst of all this was just a glorified Ed Schiren music video. This entire release has been a train wreck. Whoever in the marketing team approved this needs to be fired.
And the new pokemon scarlet and Violet can you keep on  Dig 4 stones to help evolve your pokemon. Like a dusk stone. And a down stone. a shiny stone. And a sunstone.
What song is this?
Thank you trailer for not providing anything new
Why does gamefreak have a sadistic desire for us to start the game and pick our starters without knowing what they turn into. These people cant market for nothing.
Glad to see Donphan get two forms. At this rate I’m not expecting the final evolutions for the starters. Plus I forgot that it’s coming out next Friday so I’m definitely gonna be reading for my Scarlet adventure next weekend. 😁
Donphan wasn't enough tho
Every pokégirl a waifu
I’m quickly becoming more and more excited for this game. The fact that I can listen to this song in game is amazing.  Edit: Also, I love the throw animation at 3:15.
I hope these games will cause a lot of pleasant emotions
ayo why my boy ed in pokemon pls don’t ed sheeran us pokemon
When your song becomes an official pokemon song, you know your on your carrer-zenit ;D
ED SHEERANv
What is everyone’s starter Pokémon as of right now ? Who you choosing and why ?
FUCK THIS WHO DECIDED TO GO WITH AN ED SHEERAN SONG
I noticed that pikachu used its old cry in this trailer.  Does this mean that pikachu and eevee just aren't going to have their voice acting ingame anymore?? It made sense to me for legends arceus but its gonna feel weird for them not to have their voices anymore in the next gen
I really hope Ed Sheeran’s song makes it into the game itself. It fits perfectly.
Dont worry yall starter evos get revealed on the 18th
im glad they didnt show starter evos i would rather see it in game
im excited for the past and future forms!!!!
I love how Pokémon has used Celestial as the BGM loved it 🤩 the game looks too good too 🤩
im so hyped for this!!! i remember getting hooked on pokemon back in the 90s at gen 1, and by gen 2 thinking how cool it'd be to have a game that was like this XD my lil kid dream has really been coming true these past few pokegames hahaha~ I hope everyone enjoys their adventures!
Dammit Ed you just gotta make everything better lol.
the moment I heard Ed Sheeran, I started to dread if we will end up breaking our leg.🤣
So boring. Had to mute the sound cuz of the crappy amv vibe and failed at that as well. So far game looks crappy
This long without knowing the starters Evo is odd.
Anyone else hope that they make a Pokémon game in the future that lets you visit all the past regions because I’d love to see it
Future vs past pokemon and its not an argument of modern vs fossil pokemon happy days
Past and Future Donphan look SO COOL!
Honestly the main ideas I like are Past/Future forms, new pokemon looks, "fakemon" and evolutions for past pokemon. But I still dislike the gimmick "terrastalize" because that means there are 4 new gimmicks, for the past 4 generations, which have nothing to do with each other and only added to keep pokemon creative. Honestly felt like they could have kept Mega as the main gimmick and come up with a more unique one combining Z moves and Terrastalize to something else, but all these gimmicks just make the whole pokemon franchise absolutely bland at this point.
to be honest, i still haven't warmed up to this game
Sooo Pikachu's voice its gone and back to OG cries?
The trailer is well done -- for like a month ago. This told us nothing new, other than a brief tease of the Donphan Paradox forms. At least introduce the concept of Paradox forms in detail. The failure to show the starter evolutions is annoying, but would be less so with more new stuff in the trailer. Even just a few more new Pokemon. Don't get me wrong, I'm still excited for the game and I already pre-ordered it, but it's frustrating how tight-lipped they're being about a lot of things.
These paradox Donphan forms are making me really excited to see the other paradox forms.
I can’t believe they got Ed Sheeran for Pokémon
Besides the new Donphan forms and a nice song, nothing is new...again. I mean it's a good overview trailer, but still disappointing. Maybe the game has waaay more secrets to show when it releases; maybe not...
I’ve been playing Pokémon since I was in grade 1. I’m 18 now and seeing this still beings me the joy of playing Pokémon for the first time as a kid. Cant wait for this game
Goddamn i haven't been this hyped for a pokemon game since heartgold, lets gooo
*mutes video*
PARADOX POKÉMON CONFIRMED
I had successfully avoided ever listening to Ed Sheeran until now....  I heard the first word and went ‘oh, a terrible generic pop song’ then saw his name. I guess this was a fitting introduction.
I never thought Ed Sheeran could make me cry 😹⚡️💚💛I truly believe this is gunna be the greatest pokemon memories I've made yet, A + job too everyone, I can't wait to share this adventure with you! LET'S GO!
Snuck in a new form of Donphan as if we wouldn't notice
At first I thought they had chandeliers in their head as they got their Terra form. But I was wrong, they are crowns!
Looks decent, but man. The chainsaw edges are SO DISTRACTING. Also you can spot the use of FSR looking at the edges of the characters being so sharp. This game probably would gain a lot on the image quality with some Anti Aliasing
Well, this trailer was great as well...  Only criticism is that there's no spoilers for the starters so might as well continue to be a mystery and play the games truly blind for once!
They did Pikachu dirty again, he doesn't have his voice...
Still wanted to see the Starter evos, but still Paradox Forms YES!, MORE GEN 2 LOVE, Especially to 1 of my favorites from Johto DONPHAN 😍
Future forms are gonna be soooo siiiiick 🤩
Seeing Scizor with the fire terra type is the greatest thing ever. Can’t wait to see him shoot fire beams out of claws with Terra blast 💥
Wow. This song is corny😂
I can feel the 15 FPS frame drops already
Hopefully they let us use most of the new cool looking Pokémon early on so we can use them in a play through unlike they’ve done like they did with duraludon
Why does Celestial fit with pokemon?
This was it? No starter evolution reveal? I really am just so tired of this game and it hasn't even come out yet
Nice to see Donphan getting some love.
What the goddamn are these lyrics bro this is about catcing mons 😤
One more week left to go. The hype is real, everyone
I did not consent to hearing Ed Sheeran.
Honestly the only interesting part from this trailer was the new Donovan forms.
Wasn't expecting the starters, was hoping at least something new we didn't see. The showed the ears of the past and future donphan and dragapult. Let down
The lack of voice acting.. disturbs me
The quality is so bad but the second generation is getting more evolutions which will be good for a johto remake.
Ed Sheeran??????? In my Pokémon???????
Pokémon forcing me to listen to Ed Sheeran is worse than any rickroll
Who edited this trailer?! A Twelve year old?
When will we be getting another eeveelution?
Every time Pokémon comes out the variant specific mons always have me split, it’s so frustrating to prefer one of the box art legendaries just to find out the other game has a cooler gym leader or other mutually exclusive mons.
Am I the only one who DOESN'T want to see starter evos? I want it to be a surprise when mine evolves. It's more fun that way.
You can't tell me neo donphan doesn't look like something straight out of big hero six
Goosebumps.
I honestly don’t care that they didn’t show the starters evolve I’m Just happy that they used Ed
amazing trailer, really happy for my boy donphan, but that music selection was horrible.    also impressive how starter evolutions managed to stay hidden to this day.
Wow a trailer that told us nothing. Thanks
Mostly same footage with a different song 🙄.
Final 10 days feel longer than ever. 🤣  Also Pokémon x Ed Sheeran??! 💯!
pleasantly surprised by how good this game looks
I know you shouldnt compare Games, but one thing bugs me check out the new god of war overworld and this one, I really dont like the looks of the ground and the grass looks very scuffed except for that the rest looks really good and im hoping for another good mainline game !
10 days left!!! Who else is ready?!
Ok listen. I was expecting the starter evolutions but I think Pokémon is keeping them a secret like they did for sword and shield. But I like this little music video sequence.
Man i really really want to like the look of this one but that whole crystal thing with stupid hats just looks ridiculous ive always been a fan of pokemon but sweet jesus nahh
What was that Donphan looking thing?
soooo, we are here to downvote, aren't we?
Will there be another trailer before release or is this the last one
It’d be nice if they did different typings for the starters, just once….
*this trailer is enough to make a grown man cry...and that's ok.*
ED SHERAN wins SOUNTRACK OF THE YEAR!...
You can tell who’s new around here by them expecting the final evos
Now im even more exited for pokemon scarlett and violett
Almsot nothing new... not even the 1st stage evolutions of the starters... while being so close to release
Ain't no way they got Ed Sheeran in this
This was absolutely beautiful. I am truly stunned.
These new games look great, but Ed Sheeran really sucks.
damn, who got to marking the highlight on sponsorblock first? no one cares about ed sheeran's song.
Please put a trigger warning for Ed Sh**ran in the future please 😇🙏
NOOOO i want past dophan but i ard bought violet
I can’t wait to play Pokémon scarlet this month 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
Lol.  This is why I chose Scarlet.  I knew I'd like the ancient paradox forms more than the future Paradox Forms.  I pretty much made a joke about how all the future ones would probably just be robotic versions.  So far I'm dead on lol.
The more I look at the bike mascots the dumber they look. Creative bankrupcy isn't enough to describe it.
i am SO much more excited for these games than SWSH
Whomever cut together this trailer you made me cry thx ilu
wtf is the music
u make me feel~ like the reveal of the starters' evolution  is a million miles away~
was not expecting Ed Sheeran to play
designer: how much sparkles you want pokemon: yes
I can't WAIT to get my hands on this! Trailer and song are both wonderful, and have definitely increased my hype. :D
Man Pokémon really caught us in the marketing hook with the Ed Sheeran collab now making its way to this trailer
Ordered Scarlet just because of Professor Sada
Cringe
I'm going to assume GameFreak has no intention to show us the Starter's Evolution until either the game is release or until some time has after the game is release so players can discover the Starters' evolution line on their own.
Wow! This looks fantastic!
I ordered the violet version, but knowing both have different theme about future and past, i feel need to buy double pack instead. 🥲
My boy Dragapult is here! And that Dragon Tera crown is so gorgeous!
I’m really excited
and no sight of Absol yet
DONPHAN
Plot twist they don't evolve lol
wtf why is ed being featured
Yessss this trailer is serving us ✨nothing✨
Nahh we got baited and still no starters
I finally got to see a dragon Tera type head piece that was good enough
L song
This is such a feelgood trailer. Im ready!
My Prediction: Past Donphan will not roll, it’s tire like hide will merely be a flotation device.
Can we talk about how awful this game looks and gamefreak clearly has put no effort in polishing this game. Lets rush it for the Holidays!
I'm glad that camerupt is back.
Honestly, I am okay with this trailer. We know enough to be extremely hyped for these games. I cannot wait. 10 more days. I love the ancient Donphan, glad I picked Scarlet!
Spoilers:      Looks like we’ve got those paradox forms confirmed. Yep, that Centro’s looking more and more legit every second.
Paradox Donphan was almost worth listening to an entire Ed Sheeran song. Almost.
Ed's Celestial in my opinion is the perfect fit to hype us up for this game in this trailer! I cant wait more then ever to enjoy this experience
THIS TRAILER!!! THE MUSIC!!! IM HYPED MAN!!
I am using that red dawnphan but if someone would just leak the starters that'd be great.
Bruh we got another gen 2 evo (donphan) but not starter evos?!?  What is this gen 4 givin all these gen 2 evos
Really wanted to see starter evolutions.
Pokemon team doing everything but but show us new pokemon: ☻️
I actually like the future Donphan. It looks robotic and out of place, exactly what they're going for. These are not meant to be from our timeline
I'd accept the stupid hats if there was voice acting. Just that clip alone looked weird and hollow without voices
Did they just resengan that Dragapult?!
Looks amazing
This was actually really fun to watch
Finally some aggressive looking mons 😂
can't wait
Oh man, I love when Pokemon puts music on their videos. It's such a hype feeling.
I just feel like the landscape is boring and plain they could have done better
*ED SHEERAN????*
SHOW US THE STARTER EVOLUTIONS YOU COWARDS
Not me screaming over dreepy being in the game 😭❤️ my favorite from galar
Tyranitar and past Donphant are really making me go for scarlet
Only 10 days left! Can’t wait to start a new adventure and play this game! 😁😁
We asked for everything and they gave us one thing 😂
nice song
Im so fuckin ready
0:49 omg I love him
The music did not work for me at all. I feel so out of touch seeing all the positive comments. Alas.
Future Cloyster?!
Is there a pokemon on the front of that car thing?! 2:08
this gen has so stupid designs
This was cute! Omg Denndene ❤
I love those phone cases I wonder if there will be more we can get in the game
Song=awesome, footag=rerun garbage 👏 congrats on hyping up your final trailer only for it to be a nothing burger 👎
Why did this make me cry...
Why the hell it has a Ed Sheeran song on a Pokemon trailer? No thank you.
That's it?
Donphan looks sick 😤😤😤😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
These crystal Pokemon will suprise people as much as special event Pokemon with special moves. But feel sad we get the ledgendaries so easy
I n e e d an eeveelution.
Just pure joy
the vibe of this song is 🔥
Huh, Eevee and Pikachu don't say their names.
Wait so they aren't adding mega again and it's not for pc I am fked
ayo if some spanish leaker already has the game could i have mine early aswell wouldnt post anything on social media im just really hyped for the game rn
Ed Sheeren really made this trailer unwatchable
I should have went to the Japanese channel,the background song would have been cool
ඞ
10 days from now.
Fucking Ed Sheeran xD
Wtf kind of b.s trailer was this?
The trailer plus music restored my faith in pokemon games. Been worried since ultra sun and ultra moon. I am fully excited for this game. I wish my best friend was still around to play this game with me but I know he would want me to smile and enjoy this game. Thanks peeps =)
Wait wait wait so that donphan things were past and future ?+ I THOUGHT THE NEXT TERALIZE HAT REVEAL  WOULD BE LIKE ROCK TYPE OR ELECTRIC OR ICE BUT....DIDNT EXCPECT a dragon one so early(I mean it's 10 days left but you know what I mean)
I don't get the obsession with Ed Sheeran
For the first time ever, I will be picking the grass starter because Fuecoco is apparently going to be the Zodiac Killer
The new gem glass forms look terrible
Koraidonphan miraidonphan 🫢
Pseudowoodo can finally be a plant :o
The wheels on the legendaries look terrible
I just want to know what the starters evolve into 😭
This trailer was poop.
This ain’t bad at all. I am kinda excited
Music makes everything better than it already is.
Pokemon: Digital Monsters
can we stop with the generic ass ed sheeran music WHY IS HE HERE
If they don't use this as the new English anime theme when the scarlet and violet anime is out, I will destroy the entire earth
FUCKING ED SHEERAN BFUHBUWBuWBUIB DYING
I still don’t know what version to get 😅
As someone who doesn't follow leaks I hope they give us some new info today or tomorrow about the things I didn't recognize. One looked like some kind of Donphan but the others I didn't recognize.
I love this trailer!!! Cant wait to see the starters for myself for the first time in game!!! Glad they aren’t spoiling 😄 I love quaxly and I know whatever he looks like Imma love him🥰❤️
I saw that shiny growlithe
So we are doing music videos now 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
At this stage in the game, the continued lack of starter evo official info just makes me suspicious. What are y'all hiding.
They got freaking ed sheeran but still can't  add voice acting into the games 🗿
Can't wait omg hhhhh
I really want to know about the gym leaders in pokemon scarlet and violet
I don't generally like Ed Sheeran but this song goes well, and it makes me feel they put a lot of heart into these two games compared to SwSh. SwSh was a disappointment imo. ScVi will be a great journey I can feel it!
Ok that’s cool and all but where are the starter evolutions
It isn't too late to remove this song from this game
Why pikachu doesn't say pika pika anymore?! 1:11
Can’t believe it’s in 10 days! And I preordered it
Paradox confirmed egregors
Ok I’m officially switching my pre-order to Scarlet lol everything in Scarlet looks better
The Donphans! ❤❤❤
Still unsure which one to go for! They both looks amazing and stunning!
We thought there was going to be evos but we got big elephants instead 🤔
The starters just don’t evolve so they
Awesome ed Sher
Ed Sheeran music in Pokemon, never thought that'd happen
Beautiful trailer. There is do much more love put into this then swsh had.  Can't wait
That ancient mammoth variant of Donphan has solidified that I’m playing Scarlet. 🦣
What I heard the entire time: 🎶Celesteela🎶
It sucks im not gonna be able to buy this game right away. I base my decision on the exclusive new mons to the game. Looks like we may not know until after release
Ed Sheeran??? What are you doing near that lopuny???
This game is looking great!!! New best pokemon game? 🤔
That was incredible! Though I was expecting to see the starter evolutions
TO ALL OF THE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE DONPHAN AND MAMOSWINE; they are also convergent evolutions, equivalents of wiglett. May seem obvious, but you’d be surprised.
wow, that trailer sucked ass
Technician boosted stab terastrian Close Combat from Lucario will be terrifying
What a wonderful trip down memory lane now where’s is the trailer I can’t wait to see some new Pokémon
we do not want to see the same Pokémon  we want to see new  Pokémon  show us more .😠😠😠
Well I guess paradox Pokémon do exist. I was starting to doubt it since they hadn’t been in any trailers. But if the leaked list is also correct why no paradox Dragonite? Dragonite deserves a new form it was the original pseudo legendary but still no new form. Tyranitar and salamence had megas and now they’re getting paradox forms. Metagross got a mega. Kimmo-o has a z-move. Where’s the love for Dragonite?
Ed gone and done us wrong I didn’t want him in my game 😭😭😭😭😭
That was a bullshit trailer.
GREAT SOUNDTRACK!!
I’m enjoying the marketing they’ve been doing on this game!
Why will I just be taking selfies all day instead of advancing on in this game?!
This is where the fun begins
Sighhh.. you really put that garbage song in the trailer?
This song was tbe most surprising thing about this trailer 😂 still very excited for this game!   ....and a tad scared to see the starter evolutions....
SUCH a HYPE trailer. I can't wait!!
You guys are so lucky. I don't have 2ds or 3ds so I can't play any Pokemon games past Gen 5. I can only play upto gen 5 in my phone through emulator 😭😭😭
0:16 she made the correct choice 💙
Looking at this makes me so excited! I’m gonna choose Sprigatito as my Starter. I can’t wait to roam the world with them!
W.
Will we be able to trade to get past forms in Violet and viced versa?
i luv koraidon more after watching this! thanks nintendo :)
I swear to God Nintendo if some shitty ass fucking Ed Sheeran song actually makes it into the game I'm asking for a full refund of my double pack
Was that a normal ghost gengar terrastalized!?!
Everyone: we want to see starts evolution Pokemon: we got you, heres is a ed sheeran song trailer without the evolution. And only 1 new pokemon form is shown.
This song!!!!!!
FUTURE DONPHAN
I've been on the fence about which version to get. For the most part I've leaned toward Violet but lately I've been considering Scarlet. Regardless of whichever version I get, I'm SO excited for this game right now because this trailer was amazing!  I'm not sure if it was how fast everything flew by or Ed Sheeran's beautiful voice, but this trailer alone brought all my memories of pokemon flooding back to me and I can't wait to make new ones! This trailer makes me so emotional, but who doesn't love a good happy cry every now and again. If you'll excuse me, I have to rewatch this trailet now. Thank you, Pokemon for your immense and wonderful influence on my life over the last 25 years! Good luck on the upcoming release. 💖
Miraidonphan and Koraidonphan ...
Cetitian is *terrifying*
Guys this is gonna be a good one
2:05 Perfect Timing. 2:32 Dah Heck?!
YOOO we finally got a confirmation for paradox Pokémon, and did so using DONPHAN?? Imagine if those forms also got an evolution 🔥 Also did they just spoil Nemona’s story at the end of the game?
Not a fan of the future version of Donphan but glad he’s getting evolutions. Now if the starters could just get some 🤔
To the people confused about the two “Donphans” we saw here, I’ll explain what they are based off leaks but be warned it is a spoiler.     So that’s the ancestor and descendant of donphan, not new donphan forms or evolutions. It’s similar to the thing with Diglett and Wiglett but they actually are related. There are more Pokémon like this in the game which are what we call Paradox Pokémon, they’re story related and will be in that swirly area in the middle post game. They can’t evolve either.  Basically think of donphan as cyclizar and the past and future ones as koraidon and miraidon.
Hey Pokemon company stop sowing sadness sow happiness and show us the god damn evos its not that hard
her car is a mon
This looks fan-made
10 days…10 days away from this game being out and you haven’t shown us the final evolutions for the starters. ARE YOU LITERALLY GOING TO WAIT TILL LAST MINUTE !?
Well? Anytime now!
Thank god no starters evo I was so like no not yet I don’t wanna see it until I play the game so I can truly be surprised
1:58 When you don‘t want to evolve your starter
ED SHEERAN MADE A SONG FOR POKEMON
Good song, also YES THEY CONFIRMED THE PARADOX POKEMON! I SAW SOME PEOPLE DOUTING THERE EXISTENCE
Weirdest Ed music video ever but I’m here for it
gen 2 legit getting a glow up 🔥
This song it's so amazing holy stars
Oh, boy! More voice acting and music with lyrics to promote a home-console game that can't be bothered to spend money on either voice acting or music with lyrics!
I'm sorry this Ed Sheeran song ruins the vibe of the whole Pokemon trailer to me I wish there was a way I could just turn off song and just listen to some real pokemon music I think game freak should have put more money towards merchandise towards the game instead of this Ed Sheeran song
why does this game look like PS2 graphics man..
God this song is awful
The game is 10 days away and they're still showing us...basically nothing. This is just tedious at this point
It's like that sponge bob episode 'it's the future, EVERYTHING IS CHROME!!!'
Hyped over a rushed garbage of a cash cow game. Greedy Game Frak and TPC will be happy now that they have their own Gimme' your money mascot (gimmighoul)! See you next year Pokemon hope you'll find a studio who cares not with the likes of a greedy, lying studio and company!
Man this looks worse than a mobile game. Honestly impressive how awful this looks. Amazing.
sick music video!!!
I'm just saying, not having the starter evos yet has be really scared that this game is still not finished and the release is getting rushed! I hope to god that isn't so because I've been scared about this game being bad for a long time. It has a lot of promise but still barely anything revealed has me scared!
Story trailer when??
Is pokemon going to get all the streamers promoting thier game with copyrighted music fixed? Love the music but all the watch parties had to go silent sadly
Wait..... The last scene where you dive into the center pit of Paldea..... Is that a wormhole to the other game?
Selling Pokémon Coins of Kaledo if anyone is interested hit me up
I'm very angry. You had to ruin a perfectly good video by putting over a very crappy song, done by fucking Ed Sheeran who's music is fairly deplorable.
Yeah I’m leaning heavy for sure towards Scarlet. Maybe it’s the history fan in me that’s emerging after being suppressed by boring as heck classes in grade school but. 😂😂
Its poking time
Perenmen tantito como que pikachu ya no dira PIKA PIKA
Omg the donphan forms look incredible!
A donphan evolution?!? 👀
Idk the "future donphan" looks more like a shelgon to me. Maybe I'm missing something
Sem português:(
I hope that everyone that gets Scarlet and Violet enjoys them. Make memories and have fun!
Its just me or the legendaries pokemons look better now
Hey, Pokemon Company, where's Crocalor?! Give us the starter evos!
I can’t wait!!
BALL GUY PHONE CASE
Sad we didn't see the starters but I'm also kinda glad. It would be nice to have a genuine surprise for once.
they had money for ed sheeran but not voice action? HOW?
This is so cool
one more week!!!
Yeah Ed Sheeran isnt it lol
I used to love the old pokemon games for the music. This choice of trailer music kinda shows me how disconnected the new developing team is from the past. It's an unfortunate direction we seem to be going.
This was awesome! Idk what else to say, lol.
I wasnt expecting anything, didn't receive anything. Still buying the game
All the trailers in the world won't change my mind. No starter evolutions, no buy. But donphan look cold
Anyone got info on the song, and who singing it? It was so beautiful
Even if this didn't reveal much, this very much hypes me up for what this game has in store. I'm all for it.
Let's be honest no one was expecting Ed sheeran's music  at the start of the Trailer
let's go, there will be eevee's available   i'm going to speedrun getting glaceon XD
Wakes up to pokemon colabing with ed sheeran i hate life /joke
I remember watching the first Pokémon movie and getting so excited seeing the sailor fight with the Donphan. It feels like a full circle moment seeing Donphan and getting excited about Pokémon again 🥰
The world looks dead, the graphics look sh*t, and they released another gimmick they will abandon to do it again in the next game. I seriously don't understand why anyone is hyped!
The game comes out in 10 days and we still don't know which starters are gonna turn out goofy as hell or cool. I'm so torn between Quaxly and Fuecoco but I don't want to commit to one and have it be the wackest Pokemon since Primarina
To me and my fellow two other donphan lovers, we did it.
0:26 - STARAPTOR STATUE!!!!! My favorite Pokemon finally getting love!!!!!!!!!!!!
SONIC FRONTIERS IS OUT!!!!
I think this is the most beautiful pkmn trailer ive ever seen, totally made me feel like 10 yo again.
Still waiting for a version of Brand New World without the game audio playing
So starters dont have evolution?
Paradox Pokemon confirmed!~
So, no major info, just Ed Sheeran... yay.
Music choice earned a downvote..  Headache this early..  Not needed..
Really made me stay up until 6 just to be mildly disappointed. All I wanted to see was the final evolutions, not a 4th recap episode of stuff we’ve already seen with only two new things
I’m sorry but this was awful
There goes Nintendo Spending a chunk of the game budget on "Ed Sheeran" when instead hiring VA to add to the game, As a Gamer that is 32 and started with Red and Blue this looks disappointing and Ed voice only makes it worse. Why not use old school anime battle music and make the game nostalgic, epic like it was in the 90's
FUTURE DONPHAN?!??!?!?!??!
Ok, there is two things I love about this Trailer: 1. The music, I did not expect it to be like this. 2. The animation is smooth and clean as heck! The only thing that's missing is seeing every single evolution for the starters.
To be honest of this trailer was released 4 months ago! It probably would have been hype af!!!
Imagine Amoomgus with eviolite now. Spore. Ragepowder.  Cancer staple competitive.
Keep the cat on 4 legs
Lmfao this music tho
The song is growing on me
Damn I didnt expect the ancient Donphan to be this great！
ITS SO BEUTIFULL
Can we talk about cinematic each new Pokémon game gets
This is cool but PLZZZ NINTENDO PLZZZ GIVE US MORE OUTFIT CHOICES OTHER THAN SCHOOL UNIFORMS!!! 😭☹️
so you can hire ed sheeran but can't hire voice actors for the game?
Hope to see other new Legendarys who are also cool. Because the Hype about them is not so strong Because you get them early.
LETS GO MY BOY donFAN!
Rasenshurikennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
0:28 Gible next to riolu? Or am I just buggin
If you just turned off the music I would of just Watche it
Im crying the donphan love in this game I can't it's too perfect I missed my boy so much Holy fuck I'm so happy right now I wanna see him in person so bad
So donphan and raid confirmed...ok big deal
The ancient Donphan in Pokémon Scarlet is known as Great Tusk. The futuristic Donphan in Pokémon Violet is known as Iron Treads.
KEEP THE STARTER EVOS A SECRET ITS MORE FUN THAT WAY   Game looks good 👍🏻
I still do not see any mythicals or even the legendary terastial Pokémon and I still do not know what type Koraidon and Miraidon are
Di Sere Nere
BALL GUY PHONE BALL GUY PHONE
And the dragon terastral hat is sick !! So excited for this game to release
Whoever thought to put Ed Sheerans music on this video should lose there job! He is a plague on society…
If they don’t start pleasing the fans and customers Pokemon is going down 🤦🏻‍♂️
Idk why everyone was expecting starter evos, SwSh waited a little bit after the game came out to show them so we’re probably getting the same treatment here
The video was awesome and the music was perfect. I am so looking forward to playing Pokémon Violet
I just hope this game is better than sh*t legends Arceus. Throwing sacks at Pokemon on an empty map with 5 trainers lmao. Who woulda thought?
Ngl this might be the first Pokémon game I don’t go for the fire starter Pokémon cuz boi wtf 😂😂
This song this video is just so good ❤️
Quaxly walking animation won me over
So a blink and miss was of past or future form. Yet no starter evolution reveal. It’s bad enough they have stopped giving us eevelutions now they refuse to even share the starter evolution? And sorry, the songs good but I wanted to see them
Crying not Ed Sheeran 💀
Real talk, ima kinda whatever with pokemon at this point. Yeah I’ll buy it but probably later when its cheaper.  I just wish they had the pokemon interact with eachother while battling, instead of just showing a distant animation. It was sorta improve in Legends but this game just feels like a one up from sword and shield
Is there a reason for the Ed sheran song?
Bro in BDSP we got mythical Pokémon but now we only get phone cases?? What the heck Gamefreak??
Wow give us nothing and make us listen to the worst and whiniest artist available for 4 minutes. Love this.
Trailer is better if you mute the music!
My boy Donphan finally got an evolution? Im crying 😭😭😭
Remember the SPLATFEST guys! Team grass for me and I can’t wait! On my stream and discord just doing “guess which Pokémon” with pokedex entries everyday because I just can’t wait!
Its gonna be so hard avoiding playing this game until HOME support comes. I want to use my shiny Girafarig during my journey Nintendo!
I wonder if Pokemon hiring Ed Sheeran to do a song for Scarlet/Violet was a direct response to us saying "Btw, you have like $82 billion, why don't you actually spend some of it on the production of your games?"
but what do gemstones have to do with anything, nothing about this suggests the area has anything special about it rock-wise
This is perfect
anyone else feel like the champion might be the evil boss. lately the game have been going a "twist" evil boss. however they have done a good job of keeping their cards close to their chest.
I hope Ed is a trainer in the game 😂
kinda scared the starter evolutions are gonna suck. no reason we're less than 2 weeks away and still haven't even seen them yet
This was awful
Beautiful made me cry
Wait hold on a past Donphan……is this a hint to a new Ledgens game in the future
Wait so will the past donphan only be in scarlet and the future version only in violet? If so, that would be really dumb
Not buying this game anymore because of Ed Sheeran
Still cannot believe Ed Sheeran got to write a song for a pokemon game. It's amazing!!
2:30  When the new stuff starts
I'm so glad they didn't spoil the evolution
I’ve played 6 of the 7 games the video shows at the end of the video. I have the one that I haven’t played (Shining Pearl)
wait so past and future forms are confirmed!?
Wow donfan stage 2
I had to mute this video   thank you pokemon company
I don't complain and don't think I ever have before, but.. this was extremely underwhelming.
Of all the things they could do, they made a music video. Chad move right there
this game looks visually stunning. so glad they fixed the graphics
I so glad it’s coming out next Friday looking forward to play both
Holy shit they gave donphan TWO evolutions
Anyone else regretting preordering Violet and not Scarlet? 🙋‍♀️
Man Pokémon getting desperate with this stupid crystallization thing.
My boy donphan getting all the love :,)
Don’t get me wrong I’m still very hyped up for this game but seeing the same trailer over and over just with some new paint hasn’t been the best experience  But then again it does leave a lot of mystery to this game and I kind appreciate that because we’re going to going to this game and there’s gonna be a lot of things to surprise us
Past and future donphan is cool but we all saw that the car is a pokemon twist coming. I am counting down the days till the games come out I can’t wait
Expectacular.
I hate Ed Sheeran
They shoulda gotten carti for the song
Who gave Donphan steroids?
i feel out of the loop why are people talking about past and future versions of pokemon
These trailers are so useless. 3 minutes for half a second of something new.
Better than a Here Comes Brand New World 4 Gen8!!!!
Can’t wait!
e
Humans making no sound at all kind of makes it feel pretty silent and... boring. She literally screams and no sound at all. Why are they only making sound for Pokemon? I mean no voice acting, but at least some "Hmm hmm..." and "Oh?!" "Hey!" "Woo!" *Cheer* anything. It feels so dead.
Finally somthing that is not curry
You all know this looks terrible. This is just sad. The complete decline and collapse of the single most legendary franchise in HISTORY. ORAS, Sword and Shield, Arceus, all complete disasters and now this, what a garbage fire.
Listen, I love Pokemon and the one in charge of the youtube channel is doing great, but i'm inclined to downvote because of Ed Sheeran...
Still no starters evos
I’m so excited for these games, the future of pokemon is only 10 days away
These games look like they suck
I like the trailer and the music is fitting, can't wait to play the game! I pre-ordered from Japan tho just so I could get the art book cuz it wasn't cool excluding US from getting any physical bonus when literally everywhere else had something. I hope they don't do that again for future games.
I’m going with Violet, but I’m still torn between Sprigatito and Quaxly.
0/10 didn’t show us the starter evolutions
What the fuck A Pokémon song with actual lyrics
2:53 is the biggest blue ball yet Pokémon 😂
This video made me cry thank you gamefreak nintendo and pokemon for making such a magical dream come true in these games i am so hyped to start playing next week ❤❤❤
Koraidon make me cry
This trailer gave no information about nothing🤦🏾‍♂️ got me up in the morning to watch a music video🤨 terrible 💯
The journey starts in 10 days
Scarlet and Violet will be the best Pokémon games ever!
ed sheeran, y’all? really?
The tera raid pokebal throw animation is clean
I have an idea for a new fashion event. Pokémon Fashion Show every famous fashion model wearing outfits similar to Pokémon types. The styles of the outfit matching each type. Every fashion model wearing outfits designed to represent every 18 types ⚪Normal 👊Fighting 🪶Flying 💀Poison 🏜️Ground 🪨Rock 🐞Bug 👻Ghost 🔩Steel 🔥Fire💧Water 🌿Grass ⚡Electric 👁️Psychic ❄️Ice 🐲Dragon 🌘Dark 🧚‍♀️Fairy.  This could be a great way to celebrate Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet two new games that are coming out next month on the 18th. This would be a great way to celebrate the gams release followed by new Swarovski merchandise inspired by what's on the game I will email you the pictures for the inspiration. A lot of celebrities should attend. There should even be judges. And it should be worldwide. Live on TV and YouTube all over the news. That's an awesome idea. Fashion models everywhere. You know who should model? Someone has to find nine malls found this three so far, the 9 malls for good Pokémon journey the 8 malls will be like Pokémon gyms and if the model wins the fashion show at each of the mall, you'll be rewarded a badge.   It'll be like competing in a Pokémon gym only that it's a fashion show a ninth mall will be like the Pokémon League and whichever model wins that will be the fashion league champion. And look that's a great name for it the fashion League.  So far, we've had a lot of musical albums being made by famous singers Pokémon day which has been going on for quite some time now Pokémon jewelry and Ed Sheeran's new album featuring of new song celestial. Even a Pokémon pet contest. Wish I didn't win much to my outrage. Anyway, putting it aside what are you guys think because everybody else who I have spoken to about it all think it's a great idea to celebrate generation 9
ok Donphan past/future form?? And thank god for the mute button
Pokemon great trailer but at least show us the second stage evolution plsss
I get all of the Rotom Phone cases
So, the supposed “Koraidonphan” and “Miraidonphan” from the leaks do have some merit…
Nothing like ruining a good trailer with Ed Sheeran 😭
All that teasing with the starters in this trailer for no evolutions, they really wanna leave them for the last day/s  😓
Both Donphan look incredible. And that treasure chest mimic looks awesome too
Been playing Pokémon since Platinum, so glad to see the series finally evolve into the next stage with open world! Pokémon is always going to have a special place in my heart, and I can’t wait to see what Paldea has in store for us all!
Enjoy your Pokémon? Game guys I’m skipping this one
The futuristic donphan looks stupid but I still want it lol
Sprigatto (I will never spell that properly) is so damn cute ugh-
Game still seems desolate
The perfect synching with the scream at 2:08
Such a dramatic moment for Quaxly! He's my favorite!
Awesome
I hope Fuecoco evolves into a Spainosaurus.
This trailer has me so hyped. The game looks beautiful and it really gave that sense of adventure. Can’t wait for the game to come out!
This trailer really wasn't needed, but cool new elephant pokemon
How are we 10 days out from release and still have no official info on starter evolutions? Some people actually pick their starter based on said evolutions and not purely on their type
TW: ed sheeran
This looks like it will be a great new mainline game. Glad to see them continuing with the improvements and innovations from legends arceus. Now I just wish they added voice acting. The dead air is so awkward.
Miss the dislike button
Seeing Ancient Donphant lumbering sent a chill up my spine
Am getting violet
I would love pokemon to return back to the original rap song. Ed is onlly temporary so I shouldn't complain.
This was…disappointing
hyped
I haven’t been this excited for a Pokémon game in a really really long time
Don't try and trick me, I saw both Donphans there.
This video feels like an AMV made by a fan instead of the company
Ksksksksksk pqp, que bosta
Well, they didn't put the "Footage not final" for once and I have to admit that it looks considerably better than the past trailers. I'm still not optimistic overall but this eases some of my worries.
What the heck was this trailer
2:32 What happened to those Donphans?!
Some Nintendo exec got his daughter a gift by taking her advice on the music it seems lol
better game than swsh already, pikachu has the actual growl
Terastal Dragupult has a crystal dragon on its head!😮
The legendary Pokémon remind me of toothless when they fly
Just show the damn starter evos already!!!!
this song dont go with trailer. dis is disappointing
Good song choice :)
Ed Sheeran is like the mayo and white bread sandwich of the music world and I mean that in the meanest way possible.
What happened to having the trailers at a decent time for all timezones? I wouldn't be as annoyed with these trailers that are MOSTLY recap, at 6am. What happened to 9am PT...and to those of you who would DEFINITELY be saying 'well you could've just waited so shut up!' X clears throat x may I refer back to their Twitter post: 'You wouldn't want to miss this (meaning we suggest you see it live no matter what timezone you live in, because you wouldn't be spoiled by thumbnails!...😈)!!!'
i miss the old good days from the old games ... rip Pokemon
Its a major disappointment that you couldn't add the starter evolutions even when we're getting close to the launch.  Let us hope you do better with the info releasing next gen.
This is so hype. When I saw dragapult i got unreasonably exited
Past Donphan >>>>>>>> Future Donphan
Why is Ed Sheeran singing about Pokémon
Thats it??? what a waste of time...
God Pokémon has gone so far down hill. Using Ed shareen for their intro song.🤢 I miss when Pokémon actually had some creative effort put into it.
STARAPTOR STATUE
Future Nd past donphan looks cool  Also THE STAR MOBILE ROARED
dawg what is this music tho 😭
I love Ed Sheeran and I love Pokemon. This was amazing to watch.
Sonic Frontiers got Vandalize and I’m Here, Pokémon Scarlet and Violet got Celestial.  Awesome song Ed Sheeran, Can’t wait to see you in person next year.🤩  I declare this my theme in Scarlet and Violet.  Cause whether there’s darkness and despair, There’s always hope and light.  Even in the stars.
Ugh, ed sheeran singing for pokemon. Seriously who still likes this guy?
When is starter evos
they put ed sheern on a pok emon trai ler im shidd ing a n drying
That final trailer of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is awesome, I like Ed Sheeran's music. Can't wait gen 9, it's only 10 days those games comes out. 🔥🔥
Okay but where starter reveal?
So, we have different colored versions With Disparate Time being the theme Two distinct Dragons, one fire, one electric Likely to have different gym leaders per version The Map seems to be split around a mountain, and the routes form a circuit This is definitely either pointing to a Gen V remake or it's what happened to the development cycle for that. No complaints.
noooo why edd sheran
They forgot a trigger warning for Ed Sheeran 🤮
As a Poketch enthusiast, the BDSP phone case makes me really happy.
Is this an AMV? back in 2004 ?
Im still waiting for a pokemon game that actually has voice acting in it cause without it it feels so empty and emotionless
Damnit Teracrystals looks so damn bad, probably the ugliest gimmick. In utility seems extremely interesting, but the looks are despicable.  I hate Ed Sheeran, but I can't put it as a negative thing for the game itself.  We still don't have pokemon melee collision. We already see a lot of copy paste unfortunately. And not even talking about the Pokémons themselves. Idk...Swablu sit on they're ass on a rope...
A combination of a good song and an epic trailer! I am now having an amazing day!
Looks like Ash is going to bring his Donphan to the Paldea region  Also I hope to see Ed Sheeran in this game as a trainer to fight
Still no starters' evolution
Everyone: They gotta show the starter evolutions now right? Pokemon Company: Heres Ed Sheeran lol
Pokemon never failed with its music...
I can’t wait! It’s coming out on my birthday!!
Pokémon legends Arceus was a really good game. Can’t wait to see how this game is!!
2:01 Why are the Pokémon so gray? Growlithe and Psyduck don't look like that. What is this hideous layer of dust that's on everything in this game? Get rid of it.
I love all of this just don’t let this be the last game
They really forcing people to listen to some random song 🫠🫠 so disconnected from the fandom
Does anyone else feel like they're giving Quaxly way more spotlight than Sprigatito and Fuecoco? Idk something tells me our little duck friend might be the least popular Paldean starter as of now, but very soon that might change.
Am I the only one who is a little bit disappointed? The donphan reveal was cool, but the rest feels for me like they just mixed previous trailers,  added some music and here we have new trailer :(
I'm so hyped for the new Donphan Forms! Been my favorite pokemon since I was a kid, now its awesome its getting love again!🥰🥰
Does anyone feel something's off with the future Paradox version of Donphan? Not design-wise, sorta, but why it looks artificial?
Why is this edited like a combo video LMFAO
Give us starter evos
Imagine revealing something new and interesting for a change. Another garbage trailer, no wonder people switch to leaks to find some new pokemon that are gonna make them excited for the game
i love how this is the first series where the starters don’t evolve
Might as well do a reveal of the Donphans than repeat old stuff and already revealed content
Good trailer but COME ON SHOW US THE STARTER EVOLUTIONS ALREADY
Man they are really making us beg for the starter evolutions. Like, cmon! Lol
Oh god, the music is awful 😞 don't do this to Pokémon. Completely ruins the vibe for me.
More excited to play Sonic Frontiers than this.
Cool trailer. But I want the starter evolutions.
os cara perdeu a mão na hora que fizeram uns pokemons que puxa grau
They really made an AMV with Ed Sheeran
Donphan kinda cool but its a bit of a let down honestly...just donphan? I mean- dont get me wrong, im thankful they showed us two donphans but...i just wish it was the starters haha
Nice Ed Sheeran music video lol. I'm still baffled at the decision to include him
I'm not gonna cry... I'm not gonna cry... I'm not gonna cry... 😭😭😭 CELESTIAL!!!!!!! 😭😭😭
THEY ARE PAST AND FUTURE DONPHANS! WE STILL HAVE A CHANCE FOR PROTO AND NEO FORMS BUT THEY ARE WILD OR THEY ARE VERSION EXCLUSIVE REGIONAL DONPHAN!
Whats the name of that beautiful song?
I love being surprised by the starter evolutions. I’m soooo excited
Fans: Can we see what each starter evolves into? Pokemon: How about music video with Ed Sheeran instead? Fans: Uh how about a new Eevee evolution? Pokemon: How about a new gimmick? Fans: How about including all of the starter pokemon Pokemon: oh you want three new Tauros? We gotcha.
Feels so empty and uninspired.
Y'all I can't watch this with sound because of Ed.
Love this hype trailer! Love the song! Love how little we know, which leaves us so much more to discover! I want my Donphan nicknamed "Trunks" from Johto to battle The Great Tusk!
Well, if pokemon won't show me anything I'll just look for the leaks. I didn't want to watch an Ed Sheeran music video
Weirdest choice of music in Pokemon ever.
Still don't get the crystal thing , bring back megas
Ed Sheeran song is wack
Pretty cool.
cool video i like it a  lotte and the song is cool  as well and the pokemon is cool and pretty as well
Ed Sheeran got me sobbing, get my man out of pokemon
Characters still turn around like they're in a PS1 game.
Despite not seeing the Starter Evos(was hoping for that) it was still a cool trailer. Please let the game have a anime style opening with Celestial as the theme song.
A lot of Love From India Congratulation for new chapter that is gonna be amazing all the best Pokemon
This brought me to tears it was beautiful
So this time around we get the Singer and the Song but not the one for Galar ... Sigh 😔
I will not be fooled to go back to school, Nintendo.
Celestial!!! ♥️
So I’m wondering if Lucario having Dragon as it’s Terratype is a reference to his popularity since Gen 4.
Had to be Ed Sheeran smh
Personally I wouldn't mind any spoilers or leaks, but this... this music sound like only a damn child would hear, unless that's just what they WANTED us to listen.
Pokemon is no 1 Anime in world🥰🥰🥰🥰
So there is proto and neo forms?
Why not show the starter evos??
ed sheeran jumpscare
Very good
10 more days left
That was awesome just one more week
I really love the whole entire video and + I also loved this song ever a lot.
Is Appletun present in this game?
WOW WOW ITS THAT A NEW FOSSIL POKEMON
Johto getting the love it deserves
Just what we already knew with some shitty pop song. Great
I really dont like the crystal gimmick
"Dont wanna miss this!" -> Donphan having either 2 new forms/ paldean evolutions based on your game.
This is the first time I haven’t been able to decide on which game I wanted and bought both of them haha. This looks amazing but the music video made me laugh ngl 😂
Disappointed in the fact that this is a 4min donphan reveal to the tune of their own horn.
So... no voices for characters? Not an issue, but it would've been nice to have.  No outfits shown... again. Got 2 new pokemon reveals, confirmed some old region rumors as well. Story seems to have a lot of work put into it. Environment greatly improved on over the year. New crystal form shown, dragon type. Past game ownership rewards given out, that's nice. Early game events as well. Good song for the video. Overall, this is a good trailer. 4/5 I rate it.  I just really hate that starting outfit... I don't want to look like bug catcher timmy.
Instead of hiring ed sheeran to make a song for a cheap gameplay compilation, how about hiring better/more devs to make the game look better and have better gameplay... and maybe hire VA's for a dub?
I'll never forgive GameFreak for subjecting me to Ed Sheeran against my will
10 days left, and still no starter evos. What, are they embarrassed to show us them?
Cool trailer. It'll be as boring as watching paint dry, unfortunately. I'll wait for modders to make the game playable from an RPG standpoint.
Okay yeah, no way they aren’t doing a new “machine” type or some shit
Yay new Donphan evolutions
This has easily became one of my favorites songs of all time..everytime I hear it I get chill's and it's gets me so hyped for this game. More then I already was
YOU JUST SLIPPED IN PAST AND FUTURE FORMS OF DONPHAN??? IT LOOKS SO COOL!
A regional form for donphan and a evolution for him wow johto has got the love this year
Future Domphan can't even see, because his trunk is in the way
Love this!
Open mouth crying about the love shown for my sweet baby boy Donphan.
Bruh where is starter full evolution
The Ed Sheeran song was a welcome surprise
This song is lame
okay so im thinking armorouge and ceruledge have an evolution that doesnt involve leveling up, because them being here with all these low level pokemon makes them really stand out, and its not as if there are no other pokemon that have been revealed... idk just food for thought
Can’t wait to play Legends of Arceus but with Gen 9 Pokémon 😂
Like every other morning, I woke up and didn't want to watch an Ed Sheeran music video.  Today I am sad.
3:29 I can't wait to fly on my motorcycle
no starters...guess I'm looking at leaks then.
Ooo I'll be able to get all phone cases for the rotom phone
I woke up at 7:45 am just to listen to Ed Sheeran and see two weird ass Donphans. Thanks.
song sucks
Great trailer but no starter evos
Huh, what-
Still no damn starter evos.
10 days! 10 days! Let's go!!!
Gooddeaammnnnn
I am so excited!
*relazation* Wait a minute….if Ceruledge and Armourouge can be traded, that means no pokemons will be version exclusives!
Great trailer! Coloring seems a bit off, SnS colors and textures look better for now, more vivid. But excited!!
So who liked the digital shelgon there? And i cant wait to see the digital or steel electric salamance Edit: I didnt think about it possibly being 2 different paradox donphans but that could be it with the art they showed before it
Huh, I guess those paradox forms were real after all. I wasn’t sure they were since they were never announced up until now. I hope Sandslash is in the game or least DLC like Sw/Sh now that I have a shiny one. Either way, can’t wait for Pokemon Scarlet!
Here we gather today man of culture. Gotta catch ‘em all.
It's truly interesting to see how far games have come in my lifetime. When I was about five to seven years old, my little brother played through all of Pokemon Red and I watched. I didn't play games much back then, only watched, and it's specifically because I'm legally blind. Over the years I have gained better depth perception, and can read things just by understanding what it would say. As things have become bigger and more efficient, like TVs, consoles and games, I have been thankful to get the ability to enjoy stuff for myself.   Nintendo has really brought me, my family, friends and even my fiance some wonderful times, truly! Thank you Nintendo, Pokemon Company and all involved in all these games. Pokemon Colosseum is my favorite of the series! Let's see if Scarlet can top it! And also, can we get some Orre region remakes?! Would be awesome!   Please, whatever you do, don't bend to the world's politics! Kids need a place to retreat to that won't tell them to be perverse. That won't lie to them, or corrupt them. We have enough disgusting people in this world, too much in fact. It's been a great thing seeing Nintendo be family-friendly and wholesome. Please keep with that! Games should be an escape from nonsense, not a reminder. At that point our hobby would be wasted. I'm hopeful that morals will win the day over money and business direction. So many companies selling their souls to please the foolish, ignorant, and terrorist.   John 3:16-21 Authorized.
What a nice trailer for ScarVio! Also totally misread the title at first as "The Newest Characters" instead of "Chapters", it's been a long day and I'm tired lol Kinda unlucky that the games get released the same day I start my school project... less time to play, and more time to avoid spoilers. Guess I gotta be off the internet during the time except docs to write my report, until I get to finish the game myself. I am planning to choose Quaxly as my first starter, but on the other hand, it would be fitting for me to choose Fuecoco as my first starter, coz for my project I have chosen to measure capsaicin in chili peppers, and Fuecoco is a chili itself! I'm at my 3rd semester studying to become a laborant (person who works in a laboratory), if anyone's curious. Oh dear... Quaxly coz I love it, or Fuecoco for the science? Oof... hard choices...
That Spigarito wont stand a chance against that titan Klawf😂
So the nett knowledge we get from this video are future and past formes/variants, and the Raidons can fly?
Just a week away and I’ll transfer all 3 starters to one game
i dont like this trailer man. its weird like it doesnt fit and feels like the end of an animated kids movie. it feels like theyre going for the most safe decisions for their brand, Idk it looks like a warning sign for the game
Well wasn’t really anything new aside from 2 Pokémon :/ I just want to see the starter evolutions. More so now than ever cause I can’t pick between them as they all look amazing this time around. Kinda wish they showed more of something new. Lol
Harsh truth that people refuse to accept: There will be no starter evos until the game drops
oh that blazer on the blonde trainer with the fuecoco is cute
Okay wait, past Donphan is my favorite design so far. Gives Mammoth vibes without all the hair
Hi so can yall please RELEASE THE STARTER EVOS????
eh
Didn't they say that this would be news on the game? The song is great and the music video of clips but together is nice but this definitely doesn't count as news.
WOOOOO LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO WE GET CASES FOR OUR ROTOM PHONE NOW WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Wait was celestial made for this trailer or did they ask to use it
I can't believe all the hype was for an Ed Sheehan music video
2022 Pokemon available in dull pastel colors only 🤦‍♂️
music haaard carried this trailer
AMV ass song
I’m half-expecting the starters don’t evolve, this time around.
WHAT ARE THE MYITHCALS
I want to feel mad that we didnt get the starter evo's but god damn it, POKEMON DID IT AGAIN
I hope I'll be able to catch maractus in this game
Ngl, had to watch the whole thing on mute. Because yeah.
Why tf is Ed here
cool
Your Game got leaketd lmao
Donphan!?!?!?!??!
This games gonna be a banger
99% (of time) old info and 1% new... You guys are just bad at marketing. Not gonna give u a dime without knowing that the game actually was put efforts in and being good. You lost my interest and loyalty after 7 gens
Ah yes. The high musical production in contrast to the.. barely adequate visuals and graphical qualities of a new Pokémon game definitely hypes me up for another mediocre adventure.
I was expecting and really excited for starter evolutions! Future Paradox Donphan screen texture and body looks so nice!
i can't beleive this is finally happening. i remember a year or two ago i was wondering what gen 9 would look like, and now we know, and honestly it looks amazing so far!
Please fire whoever is in charge of your marketing team and dont make any more trailers with ed Sheeran music
Seeing how the main character is riding the legendary Pokémon in a lot of the trailers hopefully this dosent mean we will catch them at the start of the game
How am I supposed to choose the starter if i dont know how they are in final stage?!!!
New video clip from Ed? Damn I expected more…
wow
Everything looking great!  :D
Damn pokemon has really changed  i think after mega evo they just started flopping
I can't believe I just got Ed Sheeran'd
Wow great trailer but for the first time no second evolution for the starters yet? Thank goodness for the leakers so I’m already pick the fire starter for my main game violet because I saw his second evolution already. So can wait for the date mine to see more if game freak not showing it!
holy moley this song sucks give us the japanese trailer song
I really hope this song isn't in the game ...
edd sheran + pokemon = masterpiece
Give the people what they want lols
Fuck it the game release is next week and still no starters? I go watch leaks. The starter evos are the only thing I wanna know
...what even is this? An AMV? Feels like one. A bad one.   What happened to this franchise...
A pokémon Company deveria respeitar os fãs!!!
How do we not have the full Pokédex yet?
Much better to watch muted
IT'S BEAUTIFUL
First off, awesome song, I'll definitely be buying it from iTunes if it's available.  Second, WAS THAT A DONPHAN EVOLUTION?!
The best starter finally getting some time.
i am hyped in spite of myself
Okay, NOW I'm convinced of the fact that there are Paradox Pokémon
If I don't see the starter evolutions soon I will combust
Shout out to Ed Sheeran who gave his song for the trailer. Supporting the culture☝️🔥
This song is really epic with the trailer! Really hope this generation becomes the best generation in 10 years even of all time.
Love thos song. They need to keep on making legends. First Bump of Chicken, now our boy Ed, wonder who's next!  PS: been avoiding the leaks, but I sorta need to know what my bois will evoke into fam.
Debería cantar Bisbal
cool
Did i just imagin it or did i saw pokemon that looked like donphan? 😶😶😶😶😶
god what an awful song... really boring
Anyone else balling their eyes out right now
I am so glad that Pokémon scarlet and violet are giving underrated Pokémon regional forms also where celestial Ed Sheeran Pokémon
Nooooooooo
ed sheeran jumpscare
Anyone else notice Cetitan gets the dragon Tera type?
Notice how everything we seen will be in the game. Usually there are some clips that may say "this will not be in game"
Theyre doing this game a lot of justice the way they're hyping it up and slowly spoon feeding us reveals. I wanna see what's up with that donphan they showed!! I'm excited and I hope it lives up to the hype.  Only issue for me is I sent my switch off for repairs yesterday so I'm hoping it comes back before the games come out
As great as that was, I'm not going to lie, I rewatched it with Gotta Catch'em All playing in the background starting at the 0:15 mark and it made it even better! :)
Come on, TPC. What happened to the good 'ol days when we had to wait for the next months issue of CoroCoro magazine. Give the fans what we keep asking for, THE MIDDLE EVOLUTIONS. I could care less about the majority of stuff you've shown us, several times already. We don't need the whole Pokedex, just give us SOMETHING.  Especially taking down leaks before dropping the trailer, we expected more than just past/future Donphan.  This is not the way to promote your games. Yes, everyone is going to buy them anyway, showing us some new stuff instead of 3 and a half minutes of nothing new, really isn't going to hurt your sales. Hyping the video the way you did, really hurts this trailer.
I would've prefferred to watch this without Ed Sheeran's song tbh.  But nonetheless excited.
DONPHAN EVOLUTION??
I’m so exited!
this was lame. it was just a music video!
So still no starters?😐 AT LEAST show the middle evos
Pokedex leak confirmed - the donphan forms were there
Give the editor a raise.
I hate that doods got wheels and yet he runs.
A far better song than Lifelight.
Is Ed sheeran a pokemon confirmed?!?!?!
This is just so shitty. To really see that they just compiled all the already uploaded videos to make this video to earn YouTube ad revenue. This time around, it’s just been so tormenting to see them literally just mess around with us. Horrible trailer. Gonna dislike it really. Just click bait and useless.  No information about things that really matter. Nothing new at all lol. Such a disappointment. But hey at least we got mid length videos dedicated to one one Pokémon each that no one cares about :).
After a long time I can sense some love put into the franchise and I’m happy
They finally revealed the ancient variations that we keep hearing about. Donphan looks amazing
*We can finally have a dragon type charizard*
Why do they even waste their time and money on ads like this. Hype everyone up for literally nothing. Tbh they need 1 ad. Its pokemon, we're gunna buy it
Ok I'm picking Scarlet the past Dophan looks OP but the future one looks Strange.
FINALLY PARADOX POKÉMON!!!
Oh no…it looks good
It's nice for the pokemon company to hire washed up artist to make music for their trailer good for them LMAO
Bro WHAT is THAT?!!!!!!! 2:32
The music is beautiful I can’t wait this game is gonna be great 😢❤❤❤Ed sheeren did so good
0:22 now they're just making him look bad on purpose.😂😂
My bro Ed slayed on this
Donphant, ayo??
From New Legendaries To Literal Collabs With Ed Sheeran, The Freaks Of Games Never Ceases To Surprise Us!😊😊😊
so HYPED!!!  that paradox donphan situation looks rad and also makes me wonder if the pokedex leak is true....  ungaboongus when?
10 days left, and still no starter evolutions. Why?!
My biggest concern right now is if you can "give" a pokemon a tera type. I would hope it's possible. Be nice to use pokemon effectively from previous games.
Meh. atleast geeta is hot.
Nobody cares about Ed Sheeran
wow in love with all the Pokémon coming.
I prefer the normal style pokemon music had to mute the singing, looks good tho
Never play that song again
Walter
Great trailer! Looking forward to the game.
Ngl i expect more new pokemons and starter evolution and such, instead i get a compilation of previous trailers with some "progress" , even the donphan reveal isnt exactly show the full sprite + typing, why do i keep getting this feeling that they gonna give us only 20 new pkm or so on this new gen, base on the lack of new mons on trailer, i pray that i am wrong and all those leaks are real.
Another trailer they wanted us all to tune in for in the hopes of learning something new about these games only to be 99% things we already knew and hardly telling us anything like several previous trailers already….  This is why I’m looking forward to leaks as these trailers don’t hardly tell you anything that we didn’t already know about the games yet they come out in a few days.
Phaphy the cutey gets two new forms, let’s go
why am i crying
Still wish we would get good pre-order bonuses like everyone else
No starter evolutions revealed yet and we got 10 days until release 💀
I'm bummed about no starter evos but past Donphan looks sick
3 questions  1 will we be able to drift with the legendary  2 do you get anything for preorder it  3 what going to happened in the fog
Always as UNEXPECTED !
bro not the damn ed sheeran music 💀
I clicked on this and I don't know what I expected but I know it wasn't ed sheeran
Those phone cases for playing previous games is actually sick
*MUTE*
I am so hype for this this game
The future Donphan looks weird but in a cool way
They really just showed paradox Pokémon like that
Ngl so glad my favourite pokemon is getting some love....
If we got a vocal track maybe there will be some voice acting in the next game. 😅
OH.  MY.
Yuck. Use the game music. Stop adding in pop crap and terrible acting that isn’t in the game.
This region has an actual name
please we are waiting fot starter evolutions, this is torture
WHERE ARE THE STARTER EVOS
why would the choose such a song
Oh so dophan gained past and Future forms cool
Just an ed sheeran music video 😕
it’s a compilation of all the trailers y’all, DONT waste your time
I’ll give it to ya gamefreak you made the game look real good today
Ancient Donphan
They’re really keeping a lot of aspects of Scarlet/Violet a secret. Here’s to the leaks, I guess.
Paradox forms?
So Ancient and Future forms confirmed!? Primal Donphan and Robo Donphan o.o
@1:56 what was that white pokemon?
10 days!!! Very hyped to play these games!
Yooo that Donphan sceneeeee
no feraligatr and fuecoco evolution is a sombrero ugly Digimon. We need the National Dex so bad 🤕
I can’t believe the Pokémon company tricked me into listening to an Ed Sheeran song. I’m suing for emotional distress.
I do not like that song
I legit can't wait for the outrage when it turns out Sprigatito is bipedal. Shadenfreude. 😁
They gave us so much new information without delving into it at all
No nat dex, no buy
Donphan getting some love
I am officially team Quaxly
Koraidonphan and Miraidonphan look amazing!!!
Lol the future paradox Donphan looks so derpy
I love that leaks were right and it seems we're getting past and future forms. I also like the rotom phone cases, i own all the other games so i dont know which ill pick to have, but im excited to also be able to customize our phones.
At least we got Ed Sheeran
❤
HOW THE HECK DID YOU GET ED SHERREN TO COMPOSE!
I become more and more doubtful with each trailer
Was that a Donphan evolution???👀👀👀
me to my dog: OOOOOOooooOOOOOhhhh CELESTIAL 😭❤
Hi guys just joined one minute before it was published for an hour ago
this songs a bop
Truly was expecting the evolution especially with there only being 9 days left
where are the starter evolutions?
Koraidonphan and Miraidonphan
Bruh I just wanna see the starter evos
That ancient donphan tho!!
Celestial ❤🎉😊
Will I still get the pikachu if I already pre ordered it
Looks like an NES game
The music so unnecessary
WOW
You showed starter evolutions in Gen 7, and you stopped since Gen 8, what is wrong with you!?
I still don't change the fact that Terastal forms designs with the crowns and everything sucks, its ridiculous and stupid. Worst New mechanic design EVER. I MEAN IT.
What if there are simply no starter evolutions 😭
Donphan <3
Man, wow. I've not been this excited for a new Pokemon game in a minute. This looks stunning. I am ready to go...and I get to play over the holiday break time. This will be a Thanksgiving to remember for me. :)
10 days away and you really just released a trailer compiling the other trailers you've made with actual info but added 2 more mons and a single scene of game events/lore. Your marketing is the reason why leaks are popular. I understand not giving away the entire game but please give us something more than showcasing pokemon that you've randomly selected. Take a look at the top comment of this video. You will already sell to the people who have been hyped about the game, marketing should be about helping people on the fence or hesitant about certain aspects of your product become more confident in the decision to purchase said product. The leakers, whom I assume you have a negative outlook towards, are doing that job better than you are.
WOOHEE WE GET PHONE CASES I TOTALLY CARE WOOHOO
me siento ofendido por que no canto alex ubago.
Looks great. Trash song.
I’ve been hyped since the start but the closer we get? The closer I am to vibrate off into a few dimensions from sheer excitement! One of three of my original special interests even to this day! I’ll always be hyped for more!
The idea that you can now do more together than just fights or trade is a plain funny one!😎
I kinda want to know what happened to Pokemon in the future for them to transform to robots/cyborgs?
That sucked
Someone please release leaks because this is irritating no really new info please release the full pokedex because this wasn't worth anyone time I rather it be like sword and shield Someone release all the mons because pokemon isn't giving much info anymore I expected more info when pokemon scarlet and violet are halfway away but we get this no starters evolutions no actual interesting news or information
Pokemon is doing great this time around keeping so much underwraps. Cannot wait for next weekend!
Peakémon Scarlet and Violet
This should take me off nnn
Has any franchise had so many useless trailers
I hate songs with the power of love and friendship we get it
Song?
What's the ham made of TPC? That's the ultimate question.
ngl this was extremely disappointing to me I was expecting important info with at least starter evos or something instead its a crappy music video trailer thing with only 2 new FORMS of pokemon
This is beautiful 😍
The last thing i expected to hear in this trailer was ed sheeran
I’m so hyped for Pokémon scarlet it’s going to be so much fun and awesome I already preordered it at the GameStop near my house I’m so excited to play it
I’ve a genuine feeling that all 3 starters are going to have bipedal humanoid looking evolutions & that’s why they’re not showing the final evolutions
Nice but I guess I ease expecting more
The trailer doesn't seem to fit the song...
I am ready.
oh my GOODNESS!!!!!!! when the legendaries were flying up through the clouds it felt like a childhood dream came true 💕
Cant believe Im gonna have to wait until next month to get the game! I wish I wasnt broke lmao
Bring me back to Gens 3-5 so I don’t have to see this
I can’t not pick Sprigatito. It’s too cute to not choose to go with me.
Well the leaks about Donphan's alternate from was correct
Man this trailer was HYPE...the song, the editing, everything!!   Didn't think it was possible to get any more excited for these games than I was already was.  Bring on the 18th!!!
Don't tell me we aren't getting the "3-Stage" bird Pokemon 🥺
Pikachu and Eevee don't say their names anymore??😯
Paradox Donphaaaaaaaaan!!
I Pad Donphan,  I hope he have WI-FI
They really showed a whole lot of nothing
Dolphan didn’t need a evolution
I feel sorry for those that stayed up all night and those that woke up early for this
Garbage music.
This was perfect 👌🏻
HELP ME NOT ED SHEERWN LMAOOOOO UNEXPECTED
If i ever get a switch im so gonna get the duck
This was adorable. And I’m hyped for my Arceus phone case
Sorry but the song doesnt match the trailer.
I think that Donphan evolution just sold Scarlet for me
I need to play right now... I cant wait...
Im hyped for that donphan regional. He looks sick
This game is gonna suck lmao
this may be the most emotional a pokemon game has got me
A group of ppl already said they're going to hack the game and remove the Ed Shareen music and I'm so excited for that.
First Katy Perry's Electric now Celestial. These songs for Pokemon are KILLING it. They just fit the vibe of Pokemon so well. When you're in the dark and you feel lost, your best friends make your troubled heart feel a million miles away.
Aside from the fact that we dident get any starter evos, this trailer was absolutely, BEAUTIFUL. It felt so inspiring and magical to watch and listen to the song. This was just breathtaking
Normally I would get hyped from these trailers, but this one didn't do it for me.😕 I'm still excited to play Pokemon Violet though.
Please tell me we have the option to not play this song jn game...
I’m so upset that I can’t get Violet this month because my mom is getting it for me for my birthday which is next month. So until then YouTube is going to force me to be a Miltank in the China shop trying to avoid spoilers! Awesome trailer though! 💜
What was the point of the wheels on koraidon if he runs on all fours?
Donphan's Paradox forms!
Has anyone else notice that Lucario faints agin dragupult in Game and Anime                             We come to far                                  To give up                         Just waiting                   Ash vs Leon  Part 4                  So let's             That.  Pikachu win                     And countinue his journey
They really put a shiny tyranitar in the trainer huh? Lol
Seems the Paradox rumors were true after all. Looks like this is the endgame trailer, folks. See you on the 18th.
Wow donphan got an evolution
All that for a glorified music video and some glimpse of Paradox Donphans?
Ed sheran in Pokémon trailer
gym leaders having pokemon that don't fit their typing but their tara dose is sick
Definitely not the music I’d put in… But the game looks good still, can’t wait!
the song fits amazing on the video
I love Pokémon
I CANT WAIIITTTTT
Hate that I had to listen to Ed Sheeran ughhhhh my ears
Why couldn't they get Bump of Chicken for another song instead of Ed Sheeran
They really made me mute the trailer
I think it will be a great game just like Pokémon legend arcues 😊
Thats it? Thats the final trailer?
Im getting scarlet just for oonga boonga mommy professor.
This is such a massive improvement from Sword and Shield! Everything just pops so perfectly! You better not mess it up in the long run, game freak or I will not be a happy camper.
Best trailer ever?
this music makes me want to not buy this game
It looks amazing
No one was expecting a trailer like this.
I'm so hyped. I'm hoping my pre-order actually comes in next Friday.
I hate this i want starter evos
Is that TWO Donphan regional variants?
Will be flamed for this but.. not gonna lie, it looks really REALLY bad graphically. Low quality, muddy textures, looks to be barely optimised for the console. Honestly breaks any immersion of being in the Pokemon world. Other games on Switch have done soo much better, I expected more from Gamefreak when they moved to the Nintendo Switch. SWSH, Legends:Arceus and now this have been huge let downs. I think it's time Nintendo pass Pokemon off to a developer who knows what the hell they are doing with the hardware at hand.
I want the song that just played to be the intro
They spent so much time with the new gimmick for the game awhile back that they went: “Oh crabby, we need more characters and Pokémon in this game!”
Dude i wanted to see new pokemon and clicked the video to this musical crap
Beautiful. All of it!
Ok, so minus paradox Donphan, I'm trying to see where this was a trailer as opposed to a music video showing 90% of previously used footage 😫 past games, this was usually a huge reveal with starter evolutions, and more. Normally had at least a third of the Pokédex shown by now. Hate to be that negative Nancy, but secrecy like this is why people look at leaks 😅 still ordered both though, as a day 1 fan, it's blasphemy not to.
Ed Sheeran? Really? lol.
Donphan is finally getting some love.
That moment when your favourite song is played during a game trailer 🎧
Sick but I can’t believe they haven’t released the starter evos yet
We're less than two weeks away........can you PLEASE tell us what the version exclusives are?!?!
Thanks TPC for continuing to disappoint, even digimon did better
I remember playing Red version when Pokemon first came out. Reminiscing on how much the game and my own life has changed over the years actually brings tears to my eyes🥲
So we get a special dragon terra type charizard, and the dragon hat looks like mega charizard X... welp, RIP any chance of megas returning, this is them trying to satisfy mega fans... :/
Looks to have a lot of potencial though I do hope they won't make the games too easy and that they keep the online battle ranking system as well as make the tittle pokemon legendarys as of course they should be in the first place and making shinys easier to obtain. Also if they could bring over 700 into sun/moon they why can't they with later gens?
genasect 2?
2:33 Past and future forms of Donphan are confirmed.
You guys have the worse marketing ever. All this useless stuff with cheesy background music. This is why ppl datamine
The amount of hate for Ed’s song is unreal. I thought it fit great! Good tune
The sappy romantic music is hilarious considering in the JP version of DPt it was confirmed that Pokémon and people used to marry in ancient times.
Well that's disappointing
Poor Dunsparce
wow they showed nothing new except for Donphan
Game freak is just begging for leakers at this point lol
I hope we get another trailer this week because I'm far beyond disappointed with how late they are for not showing any evolutions for the starters. And just seeing only 2 new pokemon is cool but I was expecting more
Let's go, cringe song!
So fuecoco evolves into ed sheeran? Can't say that I don't see it
Why do they simply refuse to just at least show us the middle stages of the starter evolutions? Don’t let this turn into another SWSH situation where you don’t show them off because they look like actual garbage guys. Come on now.
thanks but I think I rather hear a soundtrack from the game and not some rando pop stuff
Now tell us how to get ham now
I can't wait to get my copy on next tuesday. Yes you can get it earlier.
cool
Can't wait to play. But alot of these pokemon designs are weak. Some of the worst I've seen so far
ED SHEERAN?
I'm not a fan of the graphic for the new gimmick, but the idea of it is great. Maybe Luxray will finally be useable!
Ohh man! Inner kid activated! I'm gonna have this song and Billy Crawford's Pokemon Theme playing in the background as I level up my starter pokemon!
Nintendo goes to surprise folks of starter evolutions when launch date .... bring it
Meh
This trailer is so HYPE
I better not hear this song in the game at. All.
Dang they really going to make people pick a starter without knowing how they fully evolve? A lot of people are going to be disappointed with what their picks end up looking like 🤣
So instead of what we wanted to see you show us no new info in a montage with a song that sounds like it came from 2003?
PAST AND FUTURE DONPHAAAAAN
This looks like a bad AMV
phone cases lets go!!!
One piece is real
Why are they playing Ed Sheeran over a Pokemon announcement
IS FINALLY HEREEEEEEEE !!!
That flying Pikachu is looking pretty great.
It looks great, it seems like a really great game, only a week and a half until launch.
Prepare for everybody to make trailer breakdowns
After 20 years, I still love Pokémon ❤
The song, the scenery and all the action makes my heart flutter! 🥹❤
So hype lets go!!!!
Can’t believe it’s coming out in 10 days
I liked that past version of Donphan they flashed
PARADOXXX FORMS
lol the majority of people has these big expectations on seeing starters but I just wanna know… if the linking cord makes a comeback
Hype
dude they fixed everything related to graphics 1. people complaining about the tree textures in sword and shield 2. people complaining about the tree render distance in pokemon legends 3. people complaining about pokemon looking plasticky in legends 4. people complaining about pokemon not having enough animations 5. people saying that scarlet and violet generally look trash
I wanted starters evo but that new Donphan was dope.
Wher evos
They are HOLDING the starters close to the chest and I honestly don’t mind that but I’m SO TIRED OF WAITING
The Japanese one literally says Final Trailer…. bruh I just wanna know the final evos
I can’t wait to experience this!! It’s going to be absolutely amazing!!!
I have no clue which version i should get.
My youngest brother just turned 10 two days ago, and my other little brother turns 16 four days before this comes out. They are going to love this gift for Christmas.
Day 36 of asking for God for Sprigatito's last form to be on 4 legs
02:11 Fuecoco is an amazing singer!!!
With the song, the improved visuals, and everything, I almost shed a tear
I'm so happy and so excited! I can't wait to play these!
I HATE YOU ED SHERRAN LOL
AIN NO WAY THEY USING ED SHEERAN MUSIC 😭😭😭
this is just recycled footage except for the new donphans
Thank god for the spoilers already showing their evolution trees. GOING MEXICAN FIRE FOR ME!
THE PAST AND FUTURE FORMSSSS 😭😭🔥🔥🔥 i thought the only gimmicks were terrastylized
The starter evo's are a million miles away~ 🎼
This is the first time I've actually been really excited for a pokemon game in a while. This looks awesome.
The Ed Sheeran song is godawful (like the singer). No idea why they are pushing Post Malones and Katty Perries in Pokémon but its cringe.
Ed Sheeran eh...
No… way… 😳 PROTO AND NEO FORMS ARE REAL?!
This is my favorite pokemon trailer ever why am I crying.  Can't believe we came this far from Red and blue. Pokemon was literally the only good part of my childhood.
okay pokemon, ill give you this one. the trailer is looking good, and adding the music made it really nice. great job
It looked liked it was building to the starter evolutions so I'm kinda disappointed. 🥲
Can't wait for my copy to be shipped to me
I literally can't sit through this trailer because the Ed Sheeran song is so bad
Gen 1, 🥲 glad seeing member 151 pokemon
Everything is looking really good aside from Terrastalizing. That gimmick is still so ridiculous looking. Just the same goofy hat no matter what Pokémon it’s on. Feels so uninspired compared to things like mega evolutions or dynamaxing.
Game looks fun - not a huge fan of the song but that’s just personal taste
I don’t know how I have never heard this amazing song before Ed Sheeran you are a phenomenal treasure
My boy Donphan getting some love!! It's been 3,000 years!
I cannot wait to play this within a week.
Hate Ed Sheeran so much I'm canceling the preorder
WAIT THEY WERENT SHI***NG ME ON PARADOX FORMS!?!?!?
MUTED
Wait, the wheels are their tails?
All streamers "YOU CANT PLAY ED SHEERAN IM GONNA GET MONOTIZED" me be like sucks to be you as I jam out
This music video works really well. Also, it’s really cool how different the Donfan forms are
Anciet Dolphant looks great, but man, this trailer brought almost nothing new, i am not that excited to this game...
Koraidon sounds like Toothless Im crying
Rip to all the Violet fans lmao
when i saw jolteon i became so happy. That was enough for me
can you please post a version of this trailer without that horrible song ❤
Sick!!!!
music video 😐
No megas no buy
I LOVE both. The ancient one is a little better, but i'm picking violet for Hollow Knight
Well at least the past/future Donphan was cool
That what I expect from a Pokémon game some excitement and some thrilling adventures in the Pokémon games and I just keep searching for all of the Pokémon to the end in the gen 9 game so yeah is going to be a cool thrilling game for me. 😍✨
Per the fine print on the special Flying Pikachu, it is an “Early-Purchase Bonus” not a “Pre-Order Bonus.” You only have to “purchase by February 28, 2023” and redeemed by then as well.
I am definitely using that Donphan, it’s one of my favorite Pokémon of all time. I love how the tusks look on the new form!
🧍‍♂️ 🚪🚶‍♂️
EWWWWW ED SHEERAN
What starters do y’all plan on usin?
Man, this looks really good! Looking forward playing the game with my kids. Especially my three year old Poké fan will truly love it. :)
See I’ve been team Violet from the start, but I actually think I might like the ancient evolution lines a bit better 🤔
Someone leak the starter evolutions already, so I know which one I’m gonna pick, for gods sake.
Looks like I'm going to be getting a lot of phone cases
Jolteon being here shows me that my Mono-electric is super possible.
I haven't felt this absolutely ruined by a Pokemon video since "Gotcha". _Frigging Pocket Monsters- making me feel a thing when I just got up...!_
Cute trailer, but it revealed NOTHING! Except for some returning pokemon everyone expected
Barely anything new
Where are the starter evolutions!!!!!!
I can't get through this trailer with this god awful song. Can you please just drop a trailer with Pokemon music
Damn the koraidon big yawn might make me change my preorder…
This legit made me tear up. I loved this so much, it was such a cute trailer! <3
BRUH WHERE THE HELL ARE THE STARTER EVOS!?
FRAGAPULTS IN THE GAME, LESS GO
Getting jumpscared by a song with actual lyrics in a Pokémon game/trailer shouldn't be a thing.
Before this I was going to get Violet but past forms look so much cooler I have to go with Scarlett. Why would future pokemon turn into robots?! Not liking that at all
10 days to release and no starter evos. come on NIntendo the time is right.
The ancient/future mechanic holds me to the point idno what version to buy.. and we got the first official "footage“ so i don’t think there will be much more..
The the car IS a Pokémon
Other than the two seconds of Past/Future Donphan, was this just an elaborate way to force us to listen to Ed Sheeran?
Soy FM sponsored by pokemon
Wow. Pokémon and Ed sheeran was not a combo I ever expected...
Song was awesome.....trailer was unfortunately not. Maybe I'm just a hater but I expect MORE new stuff to be shown from a 3:55 trailer beside two measly seconds of new Donphan
Transformers
Disappointing
that was nice in all but when are we gonna see the final evolutions of the starter Pokemon?, also i look forward to playing the game soon
That donphan though....
Probably the best Pokemon trailer since ever.
Imagine staying awake all night just to listen to Ed Sheeran .-.
I did not consent to Ed Sheeran
Not a lot of updates involving pokemon or their evolution but I like the song and the footage.
I watched this on mute, the song was the worst part of this trailer💀
When you come for starter evolutions but get Ed Sheeran
La sussy
I can't believe it Pokemon, you made us all hype for just a crappy overview trailer with Edd Sheeran playing on the background. We only got a brief look at what I assume is a Donphan Paldeian form. And for omly this yall decided to erase all leaks. You're dissapointing.  Edit: sorry i just was feeling bad because i had two tests 🥰
Lmao it's almost near release why not show starters
never in my life i muted a video faster
Always exciting starting a new pokemon generation. fingers crossed gen 9 will be a good one
Eddie, no 😩
Music carried this trailer.  Otherwise, I guess prehistoric Donphan looks cool. Future one looks goofy.
i love this soooooooooooooooo much
I like this montage thing  But starter evolutions
Are we ever going to get voice overs? 🤦‍♂️ I mean damn! It’s almost 2023! 😂
I was expecting starter evolutions, what is Ed Sheeran doing here?
I love Pokémon but I hate Ed sheeran what a harsh sacrifice I have had to make just to see Donphan
Neat video! Thanks for uploading! The new Donphan forms look interesting, especially the ancient one!
I got chills 😭 the song is so good
This music video is epic
You make me feel like a banana
I wasn’t expecting a music video but I’m definitely glad the graphics look a lot better
Damn They Really Remained Lowkey About Starter Evolutions, New Pokemon, New Characters I remember in Gen 7 they leaked almost 80% of the game
Ayo Geeta character design looks epic
How about a Pokémon game based off of the  original TV series! I mean the same characters and names! Would love to play as ash and have the original cast voice it! I’d pay for that!
Damn I felt I was gonna cry watching this as if I already experienced the game
Why no free catching Pokemon in a game about catching Pokemon and for no reason?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
About to use more Johto Pokemon than in the Johto games
This video was so good!!! I got goosebumps!  I'm so excited for this game!🤩😭🥰💖
Starters haven't been shown officially before launch since before sun and moon
Welp, looks like I'll again be delaying playing the game a day or two until people post up the starter evolutions.
I never thought I would see the day where ed Sheeran would make a song for an upcoming pokemon game, but here I am today
Motherflippers teased both paradox donphans, im astonished
Ok but why edd sheran 😭
they reset Pikachu and Eevees cry nooo
I know some of us got mad when you revealed the whole evolution line of the starters but for the love of all that is real, can we at least get a confirmation on the second forms? I want to know if I'm going with the right starter for me.
I have officially listened to an Ed Sheeran song and I wish I could unhear it. I loathe him.  But, I cannot express how much I love Tyranitar and Gengar are in SV. I really hope I can have Venusaur and Darkrai as well
Pokemon home is going to be added same day o_O
Still waiting for their final evos😭
Did not need to hear Ed Sheeran during the trailer
No starter evolutions, but that future Donovan looks super weird yet cool
And this is why leaks for Pokémon games are so prevalent. No new info given :(
Muted immediately
Beautiful Vid and also a nice compelling song by Ed Sheeran to boot. This game will offer us a beautiful escape from the turmoil and harsh reality of current world events. Nothing will stop this games launch. Not even nuclear war. Only 10 more days to go. In the meantime let’s send Sword and Shield out with a Bang!
Could’ve live without the awful song. Remember a few years ago where we got a awesome song and music video from Bump of Chicken? Do that Pokémon Company not this awful loser modern pop crap.
So basically a recap then 😐
Was that a Donphan who's appearance was based on the game you got? That's so cool! And a way better way of doing version exclusives! Same pokemon, just different forms. Either way so hyped to be getting Scarlet.
Beautiful!
I’m sure people will still play this because Pokémon. Awful mechanics like these make me wish Digimon was a contender in the video game space.
Aaaaaaand mute
I love this channel! I'm so happy that the first pokemon mainline game that gets a theme song! (this method has the same practice as other games such as Sonic)
So glad I picked Scarlet. Ancient Donphan looks great, and hopefully the others follow suit!
The performance seems less than okay for a game embarking its potential in an open world.. Thoughts?
This will be the best selling pokemon game of all time.
Whose idea was it to use *that* music for the trailer?
Im so mad that I pick Violet now. Future Donphan looks so bad with its digital emoji face.
Sleeping Jolteon was all I need
Thank god they removed dislikes
I'm gonna say it. This trailer would have been way better at the beginning of the marketing campaign.  Just show everything at the start without explanation and then explain it bit by bit.
Chest guy is cool
ONLY 10 DAYYYYSSSSSS???!?!?!!?!!!!!!
2:31 - prehistoric and futuristic Donphan
Violet look a bit of an L with that donphan 😅
Disappointing
I hate those stupid crystals hats with a passion. Jesus, they are ugly.
I'll be honest, the second I heard ed Sheeran I paused and was immediately put off
Cool I guess
2:32 oh hey it’s donphan
Man...I miss Pikachu and Eevee having there anime voices ☹
I expected the  starter evolutions :'(
Lucario!!!
The first look of the paradox pokemon increased my excitement even more. ✨✨
Before wasting my time watching the whole thing. Are there ANY new reveals?
Totally gonna buy this games!
Add Pokémon home support day one cowards
The cristalazation looks ridiculous xd
bro they used my favroite song
wth is this Ed Sheeran?
Pokemon games get better and better everytime
@Pokemon Official In all honesty this should have been a proper trailer  and you should have shown people what they want instead of playing copyrighted music
did I just see an evolution of donphan?
2:37 🙀
Had to watch this on mute ☹️
I haven't been this excited for a new generation for a while and excited to see how this game turns out
OMG PIKACHU AND EEVEE HAVE THEIR OLD CRIES BACK! HALLELUJAH!
textures crying in pain
Starter evos pls. Even just second form
Hmm Just a new legendary, no new evolutions 👎
Past Donphan > Future Donphan.  After Sada and Koraidon, Scarlet got its 3rd W.
I can make a sandwich, that’s all I need to be interested
Ed is kinda one of those singers that... just rub me the wrong way
1:25 How could it be the made the Graphics so much worse then in sword in shield and so much cornier at the same time
This trailer could've been so good but then u decided to put ed sheeran over it...
Never been this excited since HGSS, I am ready !!!
Gameplay is so nice, but this song is disaster... I hope its not going to be in the game
C'Mon, ledian evolution
They finally came out with an Alabama Donphan
Me hearing the Celestial song for a while  And surprised when suddenly it came in the vid
Dragon terastal hat?! cool! I wonder if Gyarados and Aerodactyl will terastallize into dragon types? People will dare to terastallize onix into a water type because of the crystal onix episode.
Oh my god show the final evolutions already I need to make a decision for splatfest 😭
I was so sad for a sec about no starter evolution but the paradox donphans made up for that they both look so good!!
New donphan evo
I mean yeah. This was really cool. And you showed a couple new things. BUT WE WANT THE STARTER EVOS SO WE ARENT TRYING TO FIND LEAKS!
Was the gross Ed Sheeran song necessary?
Scizor, Dragapult, & Arcanine.  Im so happy they made the cut.  Who should my remaining mons be, I think I’m gonna choose Quaxly as my starter
not ed sheeran.
BRO IS THAT PRIMAL DONPHAN!
I am officially hype.
So the past and future forms are a thing woooohoooo!!!! Go donphan
Anyone know what type that dragapults Tera type was?
I've been listening to Celestial pretty much on repeat, so when the trailer started I though I accidentally tapped on my playlist instead xD But to be honest, it made me really happy. Those new forms look awesome though! Can't wait to play this!
Ohhhh so this must've been the Ed Sheeran involvement that one person mentioned some months ago
Only 10 days! I'm so excited, maybe even the most in my entire life! Also, stream Celestial, it's SO good! Also loving the Donphan forms! If only you evolved the starters, I'm team Quaxly right now, he's an adorable little boy!
Donphan 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh thank goodness they didn't spoil the starter evos.
Prehistoric and future forms???
xd
I don't know if you guys noticed this but that dragapult taking out lucario reminded me of Leon vs ash when Leon's dragapult defeated ash's Lucario
Terastalize!
Ugh gonna need to watch this muted lol
Ya'll remember when NSYNC made a song for the first pokemon movie? That's what hearing Ed Sheeran reminds me of with this trailer.
OMG CELESTIAL IS SO GOOOOD!!!!
2:37 What is THAT?!
Can't believe I just got Ed Sheeran'd
Soon I can't wait much longer
The starter evos were only shown in sun and moon because they were leaked early so they had no choice. They weren't planning on revealing the starter evo until it was leaked then they had to reveal them because they had no choice.
This was beautiful and I’m so hype for this.
They’ve really been jabaiting us this whole timeframe up until now smdh we know nothing truly important 😂
😢 I’m so excited 🤩✨✨✨
This is so cute I don’t care about not seeing the evos 😭😭 plus Sheeran has a special place in my heart. 10/10
I wonder if Donphan is similar to the legendaries. It seems to have some past or future forms/evolutions, which reminds me of cylizar and it’s resemblance to the legendaries
I’m glad were not seeing the starter evos. I want to be surprised when it finally happens
Loved the trailer. Can’t wait for more!
I CANNOT WAIT
A bad song by a bad singer, no starter evos, and no mention of what the Donphan thing is (ignoring leaks of course), and only 10 days until the game releases.
I’m so glad paradox mons were confirmed by this, now people can stop saying they’re fake cause there’s official proof. Also NO they are not regional forms, they are a new type of mon that are mons from different timelines (futuristic in violet and prehistoric in scarlet) and are considered completely seperate from their well known original mon and have their own Pokédex page and name
OMG that Tera Scizor 😍😍😍😍😍😍 Imagine that as a shiny!!!!  Edit: The games look so much cleaner and just better than ever now. All of the negatives we've seen up to now must have been early pre-release builds.
im going to kill whoever is responsible for ed sheeran in pokemon
NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS DID I THINK POKEMON WOULD USE AN ED SHEERAN SONG
All I wanted was the starters...
Am I the only one who’s glad that Pikachu is confirmed not to be voice acted?
Is that a Donphan evolution at 2:30?! Edit: Or is it a regional variant? Either way it look cool!
Why do I keep hearing "You make me feel... LIKE MACHOP"
I am now fully expecting Celesteela to be present 🫡🎶🚀
Man I love Ed sheerans newest music video. Kinda crazy
Ed sheeran????
Dophan forms
What a cool song
Donphan is getting a past and future form? So dope. Was hoping to see some starter evolutions
I guess that was cool, but I was kind of hoping for new information.
Why is Ed Sheeran singing here? Celebrities like that don't belong. Especially not Post Malone.
Is scarlate and voilate present past of 1980s if not change pikachu and eevee cry you only have 10 days left make so some one voice act it
I think its good that they didnt show the evolutions so we can find out ourselves lol. I do miss that kind of surprise in a game.
Was not expecting this to be a music video, but I'm not disappointed. Good choice of songs.
Finally some Donphan love
It was awesome but instead of Donphan I wish it was Tyranitar and Salamence
What an... interesting song choice
Using actual music from a huge artist (his best number in my eyes). GENIUS! Even if it isn't the best mixture of music and video, it's still a very good song and nice video. Now this number will forever remember me of this moment. As it "made me feel"....
I thought i accidentally started Spotify when heard the song
This is gonna be the longest 10 days ever!!!!
Why ed sheeran 🤮
At least we got hard confirmation certain pokes will have different forms for the 2 games
1:58 Sleeping Jolteon.💛⚡ This was so beautiful with Ed Sheeran's "Celestial" song playing in the background. Can't wait to have my journey through The Paldean Region with my friends.
Paradox Donphan!!! Hell yeah!
im crying rn, not from how good it seems to be (even tho it is), but from my ears bleeding the second i hear a voice
could have done without the annoying song
So the song of Ed is for Scarlet and Violet😍❤️😱
Sadly, it tells us almost nothing new! I had such high hopes about learning more about the gym leaders, evolutions, and a few other things.   The video is amazing though! We got to see a lot of the past trailers put into one!
Are the starters gonna have evolutions?
Ed sheeren in a pokemon trailer?!
Everyone's getting unnerved because Koraidon has a wheel throat sac, but no one question's why Miraidon's tail can essentially move in an unending, ouroboros like circle.
Well, that video by AustinJohnPlays aged like a fine wine 😆
I prefer the Past counterpart for Donphan. The future one is just... No.
Oh my goodness I am so excited
The new donphan confirms that there will be future and past form for pokemon
Past and Future forms????????
I can’t wait
I dont understand calling this a good pokemon game. Its look like it's release to gamecube.
Worst trailer I’ve ever seen in my life
This is series ya game
What's the point in hyping up a trailer that shows absolutely nothing new?
I feel like we were just forced to listen to a whole song just to get 2 or 3 new images .... that dolphin was dope though.
They really seem to like Quaxly
So we just not gonna show the starter evolutions then .......... welp when the games come out expect a trailer about them just like arceus
何故かめちゃくちゃ涙出た
Tbh I don't know if we might get the sevii islands cause paldea did claim the sevii islands in 1849 but brought it back to Kanto in 1852 so I don't really know.
ps2 looking textures in late 2022
Suco gelado, cabelo arrepiado, qual o pronome do seu namorado?
The music was annoying
im crying of happiness, since i was a kid i dream with like a open world pokemon game like this is just so perfect who cares about starters evolutions (only noobs use them in the campaign), this game is going to be awesome!
Seriously guys they are never revealing the starter evos because that would ruin the fun of discovering what you starter would evolve into
disappointing
This looks decent... Looking forward to a week from Friday...
To think this is how far Pokemon’s come since red and blue
Thats it?
Who are waiting for this to come as a mod hack version in gba 🤣✋🏼
I really just want more than one save file.
Noice
No starter evolution but at least we got ed sheeran singing.. 🧍🏽‍♂️
Why was koriadon on wheels in the thumbnail? Pokemon are trollz
Anyone know the name of the song playing?
Cab you release a version of the trailer without the song?
I cant wait to play with all my family on day 1. As well as my girlfriend who’s playing her first Pokémon game on release:) the Pokémon games everyone wanted back in the day or close
So like anyone else Pikachu and Eevee have their old cries, not the anime say their name thing like they have in like the last couple of games. Excluding PLA. That's something ig 😂😂😂
For what they paid Ed Sheeran to do this song they could have got voice actors for this game.
You’re damn right this is just rinse and repeat.
Yeah, cause this is the reason I wanted to wake up early  Ed Sheeran   Didn't want to see anything starter related after the leaks reportedly started coming out in droves
Bro that new Pokemon that looked like a futuristic donphan looked AWESOME
I thought the grass starter was with the female protagonist, I don’t know what’s canon anymore.
I have a theory...  In the trailer we saw koriadon come out of the hole in the region. Then we see this. This town is right below the hole 🕳️  I think it came out of it from the  past or future then crashed on the beach next to the players house  Thats why only the player has one  There's a theory that past and future Pokémon come out of/are in the hole in Paldea  Maybe it goes to the past /future?
But why the music? Why not the normal scarlet and violet music? Or just other pkm music??? Great trailer tho am hyped for this game and it's only 9 days and 17hrs away!!
"Played by Ed Sheeran, he's so cool!" -Nintendo
There wasn’t really much of anything new in this trailer other than Donphan (which feels like a really random Pokémon to even do anything with, but that’s just my opinion) and few more Pokémon from other regions to catch. Celestial is a good song, but it feels weird here and took me out of the experience of the trailer. I’m still excited for the game, but this trailer felt completely unnecessary. A bit sad because it was made to seem like some interesting news was going to be shown
What song is this?
AHH THIS IS AMAZING!!! So hyped for the game!
imagine if the past and future looking donphans were called koraidonphan and miraidonphan that'd be funny
Neo and proto donphan?
Wow pokemon is making AMVs
Okay pokemon! Good job bringing the Pokémon music video into a gameplay video! I actually do like this song!
This song is so good
Can we get a new trailer without Ed Sheeran ruining the mood?
We all came here to see the starter evolution didn’t we smh 🤦‍♂️
Are you telling me that the theory that one of themes was related to the past and another to the future is tru with that primal and robot Donphan
I wonder what the Evolution for the Starters will look like
This game looks like it's gonna be so much fun, but.... game designers need to finally admit that if you're going to put lyrics in your game music, and they're not sung by Crush 40, don't even try, because it's going to be distracting and grating.
What a fool. Water Terra vs the grass gym? Rookie mistake. You will not see me doing that
Lezzgo!
the donphan??? HELLO??? those looked so cool
The paradox forms!!!
is that genuine graphics improvement? astounding
ED SHEERAN?!
I'm team scarlet past forms, coz I fear that future forms will include some metal Armor and weapons which is worse. Why we like Pokemon more than Digimon was the same reason as Digimon on evolution had metal armora and weapons like missile launcher, flamethrower, metal claw etc.
The Scarlet "Donphan" looks awesome, the Violet "Donphan" looks... unsettling. Miraidon having installed jets and Donphan not having a face makes the future seem very steampunk dystopian.
Where are the starter evos 👀
Why is Ed sheeran music in a pokemon trailer..
Did anyone else notice Koraidonphan and Miraidonphan? Cause I sure did.
i did not consent to listen to this man
Looks like Pikachu's cry is no longer by VA's
Yo that song slaps!
The reason we like leakers is because they don’t give us any information… are you going to show me the starters 2 weeks after the games release like gen 8 again??
Bruh they really made a Pokémon music video💀
Ed Sheeran is my favorite Pokémon.
I was hoping for starter evolutions and I knew we weren’t gonna get them, but I’m intrigued by that Donphan. I haven’t been this excited for Pokémon in years. 10 days left
I’m starting to think you find the legendaries early as part of the storyline
FINALLY THE PAST AND FUTURE FORMS YESSSS
I cant believe this awful song will actually be in the game
I am so excited? I had lost almost all hope around swsh because of the major quality drops I could see in the trailer, legends arceus wasnt much better with its visual presentation inspite of its amazing gameplay loop and improved pokemon animations, but this??? THIS??? Im hoest to goodness Excited for a pokemon game again and im so delighted. I really hope Scarlet Violet lives up to the hype.
So tpc made an amv
Maybe the real treasure will be the friends that we made along the way
The song's a banger.
Vergonhoso a franquia mais rentável da historia apresentar um jogo tão porco em pleno 2022.
THE LEAKS WERE REEEEAAAL!!!!
I gotta be honest this is a really great song just 10 more days left can’t wait to play this game I’m so excited
1:06 I think Nemona likes the player🤔
the mediocority of that song my gosh. POkemon always has such good music and they use that
Edd Sheeran does not inspire much trust
Can it really be considered a new trailer if it's 90% old footage
This was just a glorified ed sheeran vid. And donphan
We have a week left and still no sign of starter evolutions. At this rate, they're not even going to be on my team. They'll either be released or kept in the box cause this is getting boring. Even if its the second stages, it'll be at least something. 8 months we got the first trailer, and since then till now not even a glimpse, not even a hint towards what they look like
Goodbye Gen 8 you will be missed (but not you bdsp)
Hope they pick a song that fits even worse for the vibes next game!
I’m so excited for next Friday. I’ve preordered violet!  Edit: POV: Youve played all the Pokémon games on Nintendo switch so you can get all the phonecases
Hyped for Mecha Godzilla (aka future Despotar) and wondering if the Charizard Tera Raid can be shiny <3
I’m so exited
The fact you created two motorbike pokemon and only uses it's wheels just hurts my head
I hope Ed Sheeran is the final boss
I wont lie expected 2-3 new pokémon but I do dig the past form more can't wait to see the types
Donphan Paradoxes are cool. Past one is cooler looking i think. If you Don't like the Ed Sheeran song mute it.
2:40 Already changed my Discord profile to this shot of Wooper
Ayy Donphan :D
You guys are kidding right? this game is just gonna be a tad better than swsh but its still gonna be a very underwhelming game, the standards of new fans are just ultra low, we old fans that have played the 2d pokemon games we know the quality and the care for detail the games had, unfortunatelly we wont get that back anytime soon
I can't wait to see the final evolution for Fuecoco!
Damn guess I'm getting Scarlet
wow
Great trailer! Disappointed we can't see starter evolutions still... They must be really horrible or something, they showed them early on in Sun and Moon!
This is such an upgrade ☺️
donphan future and donphan past
Dragapult is back LFG
I hope the final evolutions of the initials leak out soon
I hope the final evolutions of the initials leak out soon
I hope the final evolutions of the initials leak out soon
the evos...
I hope the final evolutions of the initials leak out soon
WHERE ARE THE STARTER EVOLUTIONS
I hope the final evolutions of the initials leak out soon
Disappointed. I thought they were gonna reveal the starter evolutions. I rushed to get ready for school just to see this. STOP OVERHYPING YOUR TRAILERS! (But the Donphan paradox forms are chefs kiss)
A music video.
I hope the final evolutions of the initials leak out soon
Ed Sheeran popping off in this song 😭👍
Honestly? This trailer just did not convince me enough to pick up the game at all.  Nice song though 👍
I know this song I watched the original music video and it was grate
I thought you show us third legendary
Can't wait to play was hoping to see starter fi al evolutions but the wait continues
I appreciate that donphan got alternate form but what about my boi dunsparce maybe a new evo or form
well at least we got Paldean Donphan (that or a new evolution for Donphan?) and what Dragon Tera Type looks like, that's new i guess
Dear GAMEFREAK, Please stop forcing me to listen to Ed Sheeran. Sincerely, me.  Edit: Never mind, trailer was good, you’re excused.
TAKE MY MONEY GOD DAMN IT
Pokemon UItimate journeys  kab ayega Bhai kanfom btao na Bhai please 🥺🥺🥺💔💔💔
This song makes me appreciate what pokemon had for us thru out the years. 😭😌
I wish they had shown the donphan in a little more detail I can’t get a good idea of what he looks like but I guess I can look forward to that
I'm so hype to see how they make use of the new ideas in this one. Hopefully this is a good path for Pokemon to stay on, it'll be different but I hope it'll be worth it!
I am low key mad rn
The editing was so good it feels like the song was written just for this trailer
I hope the Psuedo for this gen is not a dragon
Miraidonphan and Koraidonphan! That's how I am calling them.
Well..........that sucked
Noooooooooooo
I hate the fact that I can't read the comments if I don't want to be spoiled by the Leaks. Guys, most people that leave comments being surprised by new contents, in this case by the new Donphan, DO NOT want to know anything about the Leaks. Please stop.
This was epic and brings so much joy to my heart
Please i just want the starter evos
I can’t wait! Let’s hope it’s a great game!
Noooooooooooo
miraidonphan and koraidonphan T o T
Should I get S or V
but why Ed Sheeran tho 😂
An extremely annoying and loud song and not showing us much new but still am looking forward to it, I hope it's good.
Nooooooooooo
This whole thing is garbage except one thing, that new Pokémons at 2:32.
Nooooooooooooo
ANCIENT DONPHAN!! AAAHHH
Couldn't the song be from a Spanish artist at least?
Cool, weird Donphan? I'm in love!
Nooooooooooo
Noooooooooooo
This fucking song better not be in the actual game I swear on fucking God
Why does this music sounds like something out of a shopping mall?
They got Ed Sheeran on this???!!!
Noooooooooo
I’m just intrigued by the music by ed Sheeran
So much Detailing! Great Like every Pokemon Game! Great Work Pokemon!
Nooooooooo
since when is pokemon allowed to use copyrighted music when theyre so anal about copyrights themselves 🤔🤔🤔 loooooooool
Nooooooooo
🤩🤩🤩
Noooooooooo
This may be the new power system the ability to evolve your pokemon past and forward  pradox
Love the video and music, but the lack of information provided is pretty bad. At this point we will get all the information from leaks than from the official source 😕
Anyone else see the shiny at 2:03 or just me?
Again another pointless video with nothing we are actually asking for.... 🤦‍♂️
Where are the starter evo"s🤦‍♂️
This game desperately needs some voice acting 😢
Oh sweet on the RotoPhone cases
Just a recap trailer basically.
2:36 according to someone, this is Pokemon 1000. Hello there.
Such a lame trailer
When they make a scarlet and violet movie, they should definitely put this song in it.
Im worried we wont be able to catch the paradox forms. They seem like there treated more as big bosses to fight like klawf more then actual pokemon. + they dont have any preevos we know that thanks to leaks and we know paradox ttar is a thing and ive been dead set on using one of those on my team since we found out about it. But like paradox ttar cant really work if it doesnt have a pre evo. And then theres the odd case of misdreavus magneton and jigglypuff and they cant evolve so can we even catch them?
While im impressed we only got so few leaks especially this close to the game dropping im concered we haven't even seen a silhouette of the final evos, that said Im honestly excited for this game and can't wait to the the final evos especially with the typings I saw leaked
Ooooh i can’t wait!!!!!
Cyborg Donphan and Ancient Donphan, that’s actually very cool.
Thank you for the Ed Sheeran music video, very cool.
I don't know why, but this music touched a 'spark' inside of me, one that i haven't felt since the Arcacia Pokemon music video... it just, iuno why but seeing this trailer with the music reminds me of what it was like when i was a 'kid' playing Pokemon Blue, the imagination, the story, the 'world' of Pokemon itself... it just makes me feel 'happy' knowing i love Pokemon even to this day, and i'm excited to play the next game!
It's just two weeks, it's just two weeks, in can get through this. Cmon man you are a patient person.
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Noooooooooooooooooooooooo
Where  Is  Ninetales  Ninetales has literally been in every main line Pokémon games and is the counterpart to Arcanine who is in this game.   Where is it?
I'm so looking forward to this game, even if I get completely lost with where to go with the storyline and everything, I'm so excited to play it
Nooooooooooooooooooooo
10 days left 🔥🔥
Got that feeling of adventure from this trailer. Love the song! 🥹🥹🥹 I feel like a kid again..
New donphan evolution is look like mammoth, but without fur.
Korai donphan vs Mirai donphan  Which one u gonna get?
Noooooooooooooooooooooooo
今回は日本語とのちがいはないっぽいな
Noooooooooooooooooooooooo
Song made me hate the video
Music and pokemon? Ok fine you got me
I haven't been this excited for a pokemon game since B&W.
Nooooooooooooooooooooooo
why did u choose ed sheeran of ALL people…
I am really digging that robot donphan design.
Oh hey look, a disappointment.
Ed did a fantastic job as always with his music
Hearts balanced on an IPHONE 11 PRO CAMERA blade!
Music???
Music has such a powerful effect on people. Play a little Ed Sheeran and people will be happy about a 4 minute trailer that shows one new thing for like 2 seconds. I can’t even tell if past Donphan has 4 legs or 2.
Donphan do passado irado! Donphan do futuro "que por** é essa?"
That's all????
THIS IS AWESOME I CANT WAIT (i also love arven)
One more week Let's GO! 😎👊
Can't wait for leakers do the job you guys have done and show us all the starter evolutions
i am so excited for this jesus Christ
Idk why but when I see the crystal pokeball throwing at the raid pokemon made me felt like through my soul I've saw it before. Like probably in my dream showing future
😉
No trailer
0:33 so he intentionally curls his tail into a wheel... BUT STILL REFUSES TO USE THE WHEEL???
No trailer
They did not have to go hard on this trailer bro I swear
Oh! video starting from 2:32 is so exciting!!!!
Finally for a long time me and my brother hype and excited to play Pokemon again... The last Pokemon game we play is X&Y...
No Trailer
The end copied the HTTYD 3 , but not in a bad way , i quite like it actually , and it makes sense bc they are dragons after all
Thanks for the 4 minute long trailer with literally no new information except for the smallest glimpses at 2 new forms for Donhpan. This is why the leaks are so exciting. Because Nintendo doesn't tell us anything themselves.
I did not consent to hearing Ed Sheeran
Are you guys getting the physical copy or digital?
Fail
Anybody else getting Elite 4 vibes when all 4 teachers was with the principal when he was giving the welcome speech or am I just over reaching 💀😂
If they had shown the starter evolutions I would have cried but they didn't show nothing new beside the paradox donphan... missed opporrunity to touch the heart of us fans with this emotional music. 🙈 why they show so less? Release is next week 🥺😭
Trailer fail
YES DONPHAN!  WE'VE WAITED YEARS FOR THIS 😂
In 10 days we will embark to a new adventure.
ed sheeran jumpscare
Really wish we had some leaks on the starter poke evolution... I would've loved to know what they turn into by now instead of regretting my desicions and starting over in game 😭
Nothing new and again that crap song...
I like past donphan but still choosing violet
I started listening to this song before it became super popular. i love this.
A presentation in all its majesty, truly amazing! This trailer presented this game in such a way that my hype levels are sky high, I can't wait to enjoy this new adventure~
What a useless video.. We have seen those already. You only needed to show the starters' evolution
Not trailer
Sleeping Jolteon 🥹
Where are the Pokémon evolutions for the starters?
Lame. Show us pokemon. This song sucks.
Game Freak was not lying when they said they were working on high quality animations! Just not in the game that we thought!
So i got a fking music video and either korai/mirai-donphan and thats it?
You have already shown this trailer.
If you look at the time 2:30 to 2:38 it shows Donphan (it least I think) but it has different forms, One is prehistoric while the other is futuristic.
When they will reveal final evolution
Dang they played us. This is why we like leakers.
We only have a week and 3 days left until the game launches I already pre ordered mine in January of this year when it first came to light
i change my buy from violet to scarlet purely because of the donphan in that game, not the legendaries or exclusive pokemon, just donphan
So how about Donphan huh? Am I missing anything else?
Nemona has champion potential. Already calling it out beforehand.
Ed sheeran I love his song Celesial I'm a big fan !
NEW DONPHAN LETS GOOOOO
Nothing new
Yessss, Finally the Paradox Pokemon
No final evolution ? Nah
Ps2 game of the year for sure! Pity Ed Sheeran was invited though.
They finally are teasing the Paradox forms. Can’t wait to fully see them.
great, now go back to 2d
Bruh Why am I getting flashbacks from Legend Arceus era where they didn't reveal the starters. It doesn't matter either way because we got these new and cool Pokemon. 😆
Companies have re-discovered AMVs then.
Really weird trailer.
That Donphan though!!!!!
Ed sheeran, huh
I'm glad I'll be able to gift my nephew a copy of Pokemon Violet on his birthday the day after their release.
Had to mute this ew
Did I just see a potential Donphan evolution? ...I need it. Give me that dinosaur looking dude NOW!
Psyduck walks peacefully towards the houndoom. Seems friendly right? Psyduck then proceeds to murder it
This is definitely the trailer ever
❤❤❤
Now this is what I've been waiting for , AMAZING TRAILER .
Am I the only one getting How To Train Your Dragon The Hidden World vibes watching Koraidon and Miraidon fly out of that chasm?
❤❤❤
❤❤❤
In SwSh we got Gmax Pikachu and Eevee In BDSP we got Mew, Jirachi, and Arceus In LA we got Shaymin and Darkrai In Scarlet and Violet, we get phone cases.
Ah pokemon company MVs
not another music video......
I'm completely disappointed they didn't show the starters evolutions 👎👎👎👎👎 but good trailer though. Donphan getting a 3rd evolution is cool or region form change
So far, not like a full pokedex of new pokemon. Hopefully there are a bunch more in the actual game.
That anicent pardox making me consider scarlet
That was not worth listening to an Ed Sheeran song for.
The past and future. I loved how this trailer made sure to give new and old pokemon a good amount of exposure.
That new Donphan evolution is an absolute LAD
Lucario returns! Thank you all.
Well now i just absolutely cannot wait to get 7 hours into a playthru, finally get to the point where i can evolve my starter to its final evolution, and then i absolutely hate the way it looks and restart my playthru and pick a new starter :) thanks Gamefreak and pokemon company
They barely showed anything new. The made everyone get really hyped for new evolutions, and we only got one new thing, while the rest was content we have seen all before.
I’m pretty sure the engjne on meli’s train is a Pokémon. It has an eye and tongue at around 02:09
I am once again reminded brassius is hot
That's a really cool mobile game they've got here. Hope it doesn't have the same pricetag as Elden Ring.
It's perfect
Okay yeah.. I'm hyped. You got me
You all really torturing us for the starter evolutions 😭 pleaaaaase! I still dont know who im gonna choose and my anxiety cant take it!
Bruh, No real things that were revealed? Lame.
10 days left and still no starter news. I need to see sprigatito stand.
we're gonna be stuck in uniforms the whole time?
10 more painful days of waiting. 😭
Cool trailer, when you turn off the sound ..
I believe Game Freak wants to suprise zs with yet another twist to their formula: No starter evos.
Fu.k Pokémon Company
Bruh it took over two minutes to show something new
That's it? An overglorified amv?
THAT PREHISTORIC DONPHAN WAS CRAZY, 110% GETTING SCARLET
To those who might argue I don't care this is beautiful!
looks awesome but ed sheeran, so its mid
Is that Ed Sheeran who sings?
Sooo y’all showed us pretty much nothing …. Again
Early
Paradox forms confirmed... and Donphan's look ABSOLUTELY BADASS!
son lagrimas de machoke 😢😢😢
Dunno bout the gay song but the visuals were cool.
Stop complaining that they did not reveal the starter evolutions they didn't reveal it for swsh so i don't know what you expected
Poor GameFreak having to deal with shmucks who are willing to leak stuff when they can just wait TEN days, idiots
AHHH I WANNA SEE MORE PARADOX POKÉMON ASAP
En el trailer japonés pone que es el trailer final...
gamefreak just isnt worthy anymore of handling this franchise. you can not love pokemon and want great things for it and be impressed by what you just saw. its warmed up garbage with a new layer of paint aka new gimmick (once again) just fak em at this point
10 MORE DAYS EVERYONE, GET READY
Well, that was... alright I guess. Great song but I was hoping they would show the starters' evolutions. It's only a few more days before the game releases.  Not 100% sure but Donphan's past and future forms are called Miraidonphan and Koraidonphan. If the leaks are true... They are cool tbh.
Wait, was that Donphan?!
This was a good trailer. New Donphan are great.  The games are coming out very soon, so I don't get the complaints about lack of new content.
Pokemon fans still yet to learn what ads are
Oh great so we wait, how long? For a new trailer and all they show us is Donphans ass
Damn no starters evolution?
This has to be the best trailer for the game I've seen. But, come on! Why haven't they shown the starter evolutions? That's what I'm really waiting for
Why in god's name is this trailer backed by an Ed Sheeran song?  I mean, its not a terrible song its just such a random choice.
I really hope DragaGOAT isn’t a version exclusive, knowing my luck it’s going to be a Scarlet exclusive (I’m getting Violet).
QUAXLY
I can’t wait to capture Lechonk 🤣 And ride on the No wheel scarlet thing
mate that song sucks eggs
That insipid pop music they used is really bothering me. I had to mute it. Is there a version with different music? I’m glad they are including and giving new forms to the original wheel Pokemon Donphan into this game. That would have been the biggest missed opportunity. It still confounds me that they didn’t include Solrock and Lunatone in the Sun and Moon games.
The only thing interesting about this was the new donphans, other than that this was a disappointment. Myself and others as well were hoping for content about the starters but this was just a waste
now who’s christian mom against vaping picked this flop song ??
It’s the Ed Sheehan song, Celestial! I thought this was going to be a credit song.
Trash
if there are those ancient and futuristic versions of pokemon I really hope the future ones don't just end up being all robots, if that's the case then they don't even feel like pokemon and it's way more uninteresting than the past forms 😭 great trailer tho
The ghost Gym leader was always there If you don't know it's the old black lady
...There's not going to be a new eeveelution, is there? 😢
Wow!
i can’t wait to get my hands on the latest arc phone
Lets gooo
Repent of your sins and trust in Jesus you will be saved love yall God bless
Past donphan form made my day!
Over then donphan this trailer was hole lot of nothing
Dang who's cutting onions this trailer is a masterpiece the only flaw are the starter evolutions
Celestial hits different when on pokemon
The music video was good and all but this is the last trailer so we would expect there to be more stuff. Don’t get me wrong there was stuff revealed but they could have revealed more
So Paradox forms are REAL!! because looks like there are two donphan forms.
Another trailer that reveals absolutely nothing, what a surprise. This is the first time in my entire life I’ve ever not been excited for a Pokémon game
Love the song
Good video. Ed Shithead made me puke but damn this movie is gonna be good!
Absolutely hyped. With Pokemon being my whole childhood and by biggest obsession, being able to see yet another game release is the best feeling ever. Thank you, Pokemon Company. I’m so excited to see where this goes.
I thought this was a trailer not a music video
Just one more week I can’t wait to get Pokémon Violet 💜
Please stop making real musicians make cringe for your dying game franchise, thanks
since when does pokemon do classy music videos?
beurkk
Heck yes! Donphan Scarlet>Donphan Violet
I thought a new trailer was going to, you know, show us new stuff lmao   At least the leaks about Paradox forms seems real? Good for Donphan, underrated pokemon.
Ahh yes. The new Ed Sheeran music with little to no new information about the games. At this point they've regurgitated the same game footage about 3 trailers over now. Geez.
The song is pretty bopping, I like it! And dang, I was hoping for starter evolutions, that’s alright though.
REALLY?!  THIS IS IT?!  NO DISPLAY OF THE STARTER EVOLUTIONS?!   I’m very disappointed with this video.   No showcase of the starter Pokémon’s evolutions.   Thanks Pokémon company!   FOR WASTING 4 MINUTES OF MY LIFE FOR NOTHING!!!!
Gonna pick up the pieces. And build a nice TM.
Its the final trailer you shouldnt be expecting more. Final trailers for game don't usually reveal much as the game is usually close to release
disappointing to say the least.
They haven’t shown the main stater evolutions yet right ?
prehistoric Donphan
Is no one mentioning that paradox form
ed sheeran jumpscare
SLEEPING JOLTEON is all I cared about he is very cute
Omg 🥲🥲 this song can we skip to the 18th please
Ahh yes go ahead and give us no new info about the new starters
Paradox Dophan looks awesome
Super hyped! The downers in this comment section can suck a booty
1(100)st!!!!!!
Hope they give Arbok some love this time around
I dunno, but having this song play for this trailer was like the best thing they could have done. It's oddly moving
I absolutely love the past form  looks almost prehistoric & savage which is badass ! But for the future paradox to literally be a robot ? Is odd no 🤨 I thought It’d have like a steel/metal aesthetic to it but I guess Miraidon should’ve been a clue to the design direction. Still hype regardless 🎉 and the song fits so well !
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I was a little worried about adding a pop song to the game, but this trailer convinced me everything is gonna be ok. The editing team did a great job!
Ed sheeran🤢
DONPHAN LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO 🐘🪨
no starter evolution reveal? sadge.
Pokemon are experts are recycling the same gameplay in every trailer BUT THOSE DONPHAN LOOK SICK
Second and third evolution pls
donphan?!?
This trailer imo was a MASSIVE disappointment minus the donphan past and future forms...that's literally all we got 10 days ahead of game release...
Yes. I can’t wait the best
Shoutout to those of us in third world countries who can't buy this cos our country's currency is too inferior to the dollar
Koraidonphan Miraidonphan
The music gave me skull cancer
0 Hype
This video would have been better without the song.
3:50 That's cute.
Donphan looks insane
i freaking double freaking triple freaking loved the song!!! im so hyped now, cant wait!!! <3 :)
Wait did that girafarig just evolve out of its pokeball?!
Awesome
Paradox form confirmed
Super hyped❤❤❤❤ can’t wait!!!
I was sick of playing Dragapult users in Gen 8. I was kinda hoping he wouldn't be in the game🥲
If this was the first gameplay trailer they showed instead it would've been impressive
To spare your ears from bleeding remember to mute the video
donphan receive some multi temporal love
The downfall of pokemon music
Wow that five seconds of new content was great x
Oh bo,i an Arc Phone!
Would have loved to see the final evolutions to the starters. Don't know why I would get a game and find out that my starter turns into a Furry's dream.....
This is the final trailer right? I still don't see anything huge worth defining a difference between the 2 games besides the legendaries. Like it appears the motive was the future vs the past but NOTHING was done with it besides the legendaries and professor's designs. Truth be told I don't plan to buy the game on release.I want to wait until the differences are made clear so I can decide.
This gives me a sense of excitement. I remember my first game being Pokemon White and seeing how far the series has come from then is amazing. I can't wait to play this game and create memories of this one.
I LOVE IT
Did my eyes deceive me or did I just see two paradox forms of Donphan?
Lady and gentleman, introducing Paradox Donphan
Ngl this is such a good and wholesome trailer. I really dig it!
I have to say,It s kinda sad to see that this sincerely pretty good recap before the game launches in a few days will probably be ignored by everyone because almost everyone is only thinking about of the starters evo,The I think idea to well,Live the evolution in kinda on the shadows can even mean we will only see playing the game and can be a sort of surprise to see what the starters will become.
thats exactly what we all needed - ROTOM PHONE CASES :D
So... No starters Evolution yet? Only paradox donphan...
CAN'T BELIEVE THAT NO STARTER EVOLUTION WAS REVEALED! This was the perfect trailer for that. Look at all the progression and journey. The fact that they were defeated in the gym battle. They could have evolved in the fight against the Titan...😥😥😥 What a waste...
Please no please dont let this be the last trailer...that was boring only one look at a new form of an old pokemon and the rest is nothing new idk how to feel about sv
2:21 so we can change clothes rather then just school uniform
The graphics definitely looks much better
Finally they're using that 100 billion dollar net worth to good use
Cool, cool, but when are we going to see the starter evolutions!? It's been a while since we've waited this long, I think
My heart was fluttering through this whole trailer and my mind was filled with wonder. Thank you for the years of exciting feelings and experiences, Pokemon Company. It really feels like I'm five years old in 1998 again.
I SEE THEM!!! Koraidonphan and Miraidonphan! It's freaking real!!! 😍
this is useless. can u give us actual new info and not ed shitreen singing
So I guess we will never see the final evaluation forms of starters or there going to be a old form and new form like what happened in the trailer
So the future/past pokemon forms were true then  Now i’m even more excited who knows which pokemon will also have these forms I know tyranitar was also one of them
mixed feelings. the fact that the graphics still look this mediocre or we have no voice acting - two of the unforgivable things for a major switch title in 2022. no Level Scaling for an open world sounds very questionable too. and I loved Legends Arceus' new and fresh gameplay but this feels like a step back to Sword/Shield.
banger
Ummm was the new donphan form of evolution?!?! I’m so curious now!
Ed Sheeran song ruins all
New Donphan form: 😶 Cool phone cases: 😎
Yes numel is in
Woke up early for an Ed Sheeran song…why would they even announce this?
0:15 Look at the boy 🥺🥺🥺
music sucks tbh but YIPPEE ONLY TEN DAYS UNTIL RELEASE
Is no one going to talk about the Ed Sheeren song? It's good!
👍👍👍👍
The hype is real, we're so close you can taste it, really cant wait
If u slow it down or pause at the right time u can see koridon's tail transform
I was kinda expecting the starter's final evo but nah, I guess I just have to wait til the launch day.
This is the best trailer to have dropped ever. I'm crying. Pokemon has come such a long way and this makes it feel like I'm gonna be starring in my own anime, not just playing a game. SO EXCITED!!!!
Man still no starter evolutions. I understand why, but I would like to choose my starter based on the final evolutions, but as it stands now I cannot.
Ngl the trailer was eh , Future and Past Donphan looks cool though. Expected more 🫤
Nice
Did they just casually and briefly confirm that the past and future forms are real?
future and past Donphan forms, what???
The box legends give toothless vibes
new donphan forms/evolutions? also finally showing a new tera type hat
WAIT! Pikachu and Eevee have their normal cries back!!! That makes me so happy!
So starter Evo’s not revealed before release, grass cats gonna stand on two feet isn’t she. Grrr!! I’m actually disappointed that this trailer didn’t reveal them.
Meh
the donphan form looks sick
I NEED TO SEE THE STARTERS EVOLUTIONS
This game looks absolutely gorgeous but I kinda hoped the final trailer before the game was a little longer and more of an informational video rather then a music video with only one bit of new info.   Still looks hype I’m excited
“That’s it? That was just an Ed Sheeran music video”
Really surprised they haven't released the  starter evos yet
Imagine if Sword and Shield was remotely this good
Love the music video style. Also the new Pokémon looked awesome. Can’t wait for next Friday
So hyped for this!
Meh..
The new donphan form you get depends of which version you get. In scarlet you get the past version which is nickname the great tusks while in violet you get the future version nicknamed iron treads.
Ahhh this gave me chills!! Also two new Rhyhorn forms???
Pretty good video showing the many things from previous videos and new forms for Donphan.
that donphan tho
Wish we got more new content but the paradox forms were dope
wow!!!! the game looks incredible the graphics look so much better. the detail on the pkm
The nostalgia and chills this video is giving. I always listen to Celestial but this gives so much feels. I can’t be crying when I finished the game. 😅
gay trailer
wtf is this garbage song?
I absolutely LOVE the music in the background for this!! I look forward to this game! I think it has so much potential for what I have wanted to see in a Pokémon game. The only thing that would make it perfect would be a National dex but I will keep hoping
Bruh why are they reusing the mario kart wii block sound for the tera pokemon
"Well, that's certainly an astounding trailer." I honestly say with tears in my eyes as my fists ball up behind me in frustration over WANTING TO SEE THE STARTER EVOLUTIONS MORE THAN ANY OTHER POKEMON OR FORM!
The paradox donphan looks amazing!!!! Also finally Scarlet gets a good exclusive
selestial
Why am I hype?
Looks like that past Donphan is a war elephant. Pretty cool
Disappointing... Can't wait for the dataminers and leakers to give us decent news.
Overall, pretty disappointed with the trailer and the music. However, I’m still really hyped that the games come out next week. I’m looking forward to experiencing open world Pokémon.
IM SO EXCITED!!! ITS ALMOST HERE!!! PALDEA HERE WE COME!!! Sure we have another week to go, but I can’t hold it back anymore. THIS IS GONNA BE SO MUCH FUN!!! I can’t wait to get my starter and go on a journey. I’m going with Quaxly. How about you?
Let's go! Past and Future Donphan!
The characters are looking clean in this trailer! They really improved on the game since the first time we got a look at it
Can someone some this up for me so I don't have to listen to Sheeran, thanks.
WHY WOULD YOU USE A QUAXLY IN A GRASS GYM
THIS I LOVE!!!!!
I love this song!
Did I really stay awake when I should be in bed... to watch a compilation trailer?
ridiculous to not show us starter evos
Really frustrated with how they're advertising. I'm excited for the games and all, but I just wish I knew what was in them definitively before I go out and buy. I get surprises and all; but I don't wanna go through the same footage we've seen over and over again to get a glimpse at something new for a few seconds.
This is so beautiful, this song.... literally chills
This will be the first game my little brother and I will play together on launch, so excited for the memories!
2:32 Anorith Donphan it's soooooo COOL. Scarlet for me 💙
Say this now, they haven't revealed the final starter evolutions because they know fans will not like them. They know exactly what kind of pokemon fans want but will intentionally make the opposite
E
I might've just cried a little bit, that music combined with the showcase and the Pokemon designs and posing with your team like in Soulsilver was just perfect. It's everything I love about this franchise and everything I've loved since I went on my first Pokemon journey at 10 years old myself! Seriously applause for this, one of the best Pokemon trailers ever.
another trailer with a song, let's go
i think its the first time boss music start in the beginning of the game
Is there a Ed Sheerless version?
Ed Sherran x Pokemon. Best. Crossover. EVER!
So much wasted screen time for the same things we already saw and one moment of new Pokémon. At least give future Donphan a real face
No Celestial from LE SSERAFIM would have been a better promotion song
This 3 minutes for like 3 seconds of partially seeing one new mon? They have sucked at showing us new stuff
The music is sooo ghhheeeeeyyyyyy
The trailer was pretty disappointing but I'm still extremely excited for the games!
Thanks for showing us fuck all new stuff. Can't wait for more leaks so we can see all the starter evolutions, since you seem intent on not showing them to us.
Looks like the rumors about the past/future Pokemon were right! Can't wait to see more <3
Go girl give us nothing!
Don't get mad when your game gets leaked if you don't show anything new
Days 10
Pokémon Twitter: “YOU DON’T WANT TO MISS THIS!!!”  Video: “Here’s a song and a Donphan.”
Can’t wait for Pokémon Scarlet, since I can meet Koraidon.
I forgot to listen to this song when it premiered, so hearing it for the first time in this trailer made me enjoy it greatly. Looking forward to this adventure.
Good to see they're going all out with this one I still don't have a switch so I won't be able to play this one either but I how tall can enjoy it better then sword and shield also I'm surprised they haven't showed anything regarding the starters with only a few days away from release
Ed Sheeran cracked on this song
Trailer builds some hype and nostalgia, but we are less than 2 weeks from release!! Why do we not have the starter evos?? I don’t feel confident preordering till we see those. Marketing is really just preparing me for disappointment.
Thank you for making a trailer I can watch on mute. 🥲
Future Donphan murdered my childhood. Maybe past Donphan will fix it but I doubt it. I really hope it's just a form change and not an evolution.
EXCITING ABOUT THE POSSIBLE  FUTURE/PAST THING
Love the dragon terrestrial hat
Oh I'm 100000% going to buy this game after it comes out!! Just gotta wait to see what the Version-Exclusive Pokemon are, and what the Starters' Final Evos look like!!
UNCLE PEAR DIO CANE
I just wanted to know how the sprigatito evolved, nothing else matters at this point besides that
Ed Sheeran? What timeline are we in
I guess futur/past Donphan confirms the leaks then
Scarlet ist better because th past donphan.
This is what’s called a music video Nintendo not a trailer!
Is that ed sheeran
Show us the evolutions.....
theres LITERALLY NO new information in this trailer i was hoping they would show at least the middle stages of the starters. my theory is they are refusing to show us the starter evolutions because they suck.
They really gotta stop hyping up trailers with nothing new in them 😒
the game looks great but what is this song ooft
Great you forced me to listen to Ed Sheeran………. 😢
I just wanna see the starter evos so I can definitively choose one of them already
its so good to see my favorite region, johto, getting so much love. ursaluna, overqwil, wyrdeer, firagiraf, and hisuian typhlosion. pokemon from what was supposed to be the end of pokemon, getting so much more. now with these new donphan forms, theres still high hope for other johto mons like dunsparce
It still feels kinda shocking to me to think that Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is coming out just this month, kinda still feels to me like Pokemon Legends Arceus just came out yesterday. I am really very excited and hyped up for the release of the game, can't wait.
Never been as hyped as this for a new Pokemon game!! 🥳
I can't wait for this game. But I'm especially hyped for Paradox  Also, I can't be the only one who's curious what is down that giant hole in the middle of the region, right?
Ed Sheeran? Too weird for me!
10 days away and we still don't  know the official dex,  starter evos or the types of the box legendaries Koraidon/Moraidon this really disappointing
They're not showing off pokemon because they know their designs are hot garbage now LOL wouldn't want to show them too early and risk a few heavy mouth breathers buying a better game instead
So still no info about the evolution of the starters.... 10 days to go and nothing
Past Donphan and Future Donphan look cool More of a fan of Pastphan tho
Mecha Donphan looks sick
You know what? I'm gonna just say it. While I am excited for these new games, TPCI really dropped the ball with the news cycle this time around. We are 10 days from release and STILL don't even know what these starters we saw NINE MONTHS AGO evolve into. Fuck these overview trailers! Yeah, the Donphan things were kinda cool, but who cares?
I am able to get a four phone cases, I am going to use the Arceus Phone Case.
For those interested in new Pokémon, look at 2:32 in the trailer.
bro just show new stuff I don’t care about 2 seconds of some mf donphan forms I wanna know stuff about the product I’m buying before buying it   Maybe if u actually marketed ur games more people wouldn’t be swarming to leak it as much lmao
As a pure hype video for the release of these games, this was AMAZING.
Past and future Donphan pog 😎
Im glad for the leaks because this trailer is basically worthless. All it did was show off a past and future form of Donphan. Cringe ass music too.
Imagine Just stolling around in pokemon until suddenly ed sheeran starts playing
I’m sorry I can’t take this trailer seriously with Ed sheeran in the background
just give us the evolutions please
Cool, but I really hope they show the final form starter evolutions before the game comes out
A Pokémon trailer with Ed Sheeran singing. Man my wife will love this so much.
Ok that was sick. I’m getting violet but ngl, a past form of a Pokémon sounds so cool to me, kinda wish I had gotten scarlet from the forms we’ve seen so far lol  Suprised we haven’t seen the middle evos of the starters yet
WOW
Dear GameFreak/TPC: people are gonna play your game, and some are going to make videos about it on YouTube. Please, do NOT make celebrity songs a core part of the actual games in the future, thnx.
This trailer was cool and all but where are the STARTER EVOS I need to see them to decide if sprigatito will actually be the one I choose
This just felt like a Pokémon music video for Ed Sheeran’s song rather than an actual game trailer.
Goofy ahh dragapult
Hope there’s more Paldean forms to look forward too.
I came for the duck 🤨
Oh! I love Wargreymon.
Disappointing trailer. I wanted to see either the Starter evolutions or some more regional variants.
Expected no starters evolutions aside from Donphan
Always nice to go an another new adventure in 'unexplored' regions.
They actually showed paradox pokemon
Worst trailer of all time
2:33 🤯🤯🤯 Finally paradox donphan
welp. still no starter evolution, but at least Donphan gets some love
Meh trailer honestly
Glad to see some donphan love, such an underated Pokemon.
Was hoping for a stater reveal but at least paradox Pokémon were confirmed
I wish this game was on better hardware the game looks horrible. And who decided to put this cringy ass music over it . Smh.
So one tiny thing that was new…
Nothing new, I wanted to see the evolutions
This trailer caught us all!!
Tech type, it's now the time gamefreaks. Cause thoses robots pokemons are the best looking thing i've seen so far.
I’m generally hyped for this game, I really enjoyed SWSH so I’m hoping for a similar exciting experience. The crystal headwear will take some getting used to though, I’m also. Wry interested to see how that plays out visually in the TCG ❤
Mr Khu was right
Dragapult returns! that’s my favorite pseudo legendary dragon
can’t believe we are only 10 days away from this games release. I still remember watching the first trailer for this!
Donphan is looking sick am planning to get violet but past version is looking awesome
Can we get the starters info pls?
Let's be honest who here wasn't expecting Charizard to be in the game
Donphan I’m not hating on it’s new form but it looks goofy 😭
Bruh where starter egos…
They showed us two more new Pokemon nice 😲
PARADOX FORMS REAL
Guys I think they want us to pick Quaxly.
How Gengar was gettin' down to Celestial was epic. But guys. A new Donphan!? Oh my damn!
Cool.  But still no information over the nursery location.
Dragapult....   I could never use this pokemon in competition correctly... But awesome trailer.  I just hope greninja back finally so I can take my out of home
Thank you for giving one of my favorite pokemon new forms/evos. Dolphan has been my favorite tarpit Tantor since the OG movie, and I've been waiting for DECADES to see him get anything.
Wasn’t expecting the music 👀
The Pokémon company’s inability to gauge what their fans actually want to see is absolutely crazy
ดีคับOS
Disappointing. I didn’t woke up for a music video
Ahh y’all sweet summer children, these aren’t alt forms of Donphan, but non the less, we finally get to see what “paradox” forms could look like
One new form, a dragon Tera crown… that’s it?
The donphans make me think that maybe proto and neo forms are actually going to be in the games but maybe not how we origanaly thought. being forms instead of  gimmick or something.
Those Donphan forms look awesome
Bro it’s just a music video.  Only new shit shown is a glimpse of Donphan with its paradox gimmick.  Just show us the Pokémon.
I so HYPE
STOP with the Ed Sheeran
10 days to go
Insert Take my money meme here
Team star car or engine confirmed to be a Pokémon. Wonder what it’s name will be
Ok video, nice song but wanted more
So is there a second gimmick introduced besides Terastalising Pokémon or is it only for certain Pokémon? Either way I’m so hyped! 🤩
2:34 Paradox donphans :D
Can't believe how hype I am for this game as a 32 year old man haha.
Let's go here early
Crying a little bit 🥲 *a whole lot
Geez that was one hell of a trailer
THE MOST INPORTANT THING is that i see water guns, psybeams, freaking hyper beams shooting from where they should. Finally animation match the pokemon and shoot from either their mouth or palms or so it seems.
God, trading for the other forms is gonna suck.
With Ed Sheeran’s music ,this game this video is on different level now !!! Can’t wait!!!
This was awesome but god damn it would it have hurt you to show the starter evolutions?    Oh well, I guess I'll just go to the leakers for that
The past Donphan looks super good! The future one is also cool, though it’s circle face looks kind of goofy.
LET'S GO! DONPLAN'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE POKEMON OF ALL TIME I AM SO UNBELIEVABLY STOKED FOR THESE NEW FORMS!
Crystallized Scizor is something that I didn’t know that I needed.
DRAGIPULT YESSSSS
Ok even though it was a music video. They got us with that big reveal     2 different forms of donphan looking scary
We got an Ed Sheeran music video disguised as a trailer. I shouldn’t be surprised, but still.
So they finally confirmed future and past forms
The Ed Sheeran jumpscare XD
I am a big fan of Pokemon and I like all those things but before Generation 6 Pokemon with what's good in it's Hay Day we can keep the Mega Evolution but the changing clothes and the photo ops and the girly stuff and I'm not feeling that fairy type stuff either now that you mention it
They should put a trigger warning for Ed Sheeran
I'm unironically excited for the rotom phone cases based on previous games
Still no starter evos😑
To all my bros expecting the starter evolutions I feel your pain
Pokémon hits different with an Ed song with it
3 minutes of nothing except for new Donphan evo/form. Hopefully leakers will show us more.
Old Pikachu Cry!
I like the music!
Is there gonna be a TCG for this
We are so close
Well no starter evolutions.
Hate Ed Sheeran
I was a bit worried about how on earth they'd use an ed Sheeran song in Pokémon and now this makes so much more sense xD can't wait to start playing the game!
OH COME ON WHERE IS THE EVOLUTIONS OF THOSE STARTERS I NEED TO KNOW OR ELSE I WONT KNOW WHICH STARTER TO GET
these games look so cool!!! i can't wait
Well, there you have it. I'm headed back to the Mega Pizzaplex.
I wish Pokemon were real..
Donohan looks fucking cool af
Donphan is getting to new forms and im Hype for this game :)
THIS IS GONNA BE THE POKÉMON GAME OF THW CENTURY!!!!!!!
Still waiting for the starters evolutions
HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE HYPE!!!!!
where is tepig
This is amazing and love Ed sheeran celestials...I'll buy violet probably
I feel like GameFreak is legitimately proud of this one, it feels good. After the torture of developing Gen 8 they've deserved the time to make a true console experience like this!  I can't wait for this, I'm hyped for Pokemon again!
BALL GUY GETS HIS OWN PHONE CASE??.
Loving the ost so far, and that Dragon Terra Dragapult has me hyped
This was a Celestial music video more than anything lol
Two donphan forms? That's awesome
Thought I’d never click dislike. Yes I liked the song and Donphan, but I pick my starter based on final evo, no new storyline info, no legendaries, and a lot of reused shots of the game. Pokémon XandY had me hyped now I don’t feel like buying this game.
Still no starter evos yikes man
FINALLY PARADOX DONPHAN
Cant wait to play
This gave me chills. Can’t believe we’re ten days away from Gen 9!
I’m so excited!!!!!
I love the copy/pasted animations.  Remember tards, the reason the dex was cut was due to "high quality animations" (bullshit) and they'll happily sell some of them back to you later.  Bueller?  Anyone here intelligent enough to pick up on any of that?
Ok, so this trailer just get celestial of Ed Sheeran in but still cool. I also saw a new pokemon at 2:36
Not much new revealed but still pretty cool, like a summary of all the trailers put together.
Big disappointment trailer. Basically an Ed Sheeran music video with less than 5 seconds of new content.
I am very much looking forward to playing!!
Only worthwhile thing in this trailer was the donphan tease. Im debating whether to actually buy a pokemon game for the first time
I don’t wanna hear this song ever again
Please don't let the ginger in on this
No starter evos? :(
The game looks good but the song is horrible
This trailer was noice, it was different, it was unusual!  TPCi, Look at moiye, look at moiye, TCPi, look at moooooiye! I've got one thing to say to ya, FLG, fantastic lookin' games! And Professor Turo looks like a great hunk of spunk, but no-one will ever beat Raihan or Leon, they're true great hunks of spunk! Pacifically, I am excited for these games and can't wait to visit Paldea!
I feel a little disappointed that the final trailer showed very little new things for us to see. The only things that peaked interest was a few new cutscenes and the past/future Donphanes. Very disappointed that our last trailer is essentially a music video full of things we have already seen.
Where the hell are the starter evos? What a cringe trailer.
This is a 4 minute trailer just for Donphan lol. Welp.
So maybe the starters don't evolve?
So is the Paradox Forms, that’s been rumored, are real?!
I want to play this game so much, and the phone cases are awsome
Ancient donphan is dope. Reg donphan is dope as is. Future donphan, ehh  I need ancient Salamence and Future tyranitar. Lemme see them! And starter evos
The first is a donphan from the past. The second is from the future. This is good with the tenses
Bro this was hype i can't wait to play these games.
Soo literally nothing again
Music was good, but the trailer could have show something more exciting, but still not hyped for the game, idk perhaps after a week been out might find hype or excitment to play the game.
That was great! That was a fabulous trailer! 10/10
Super Hyped for this games! I got like 4 family members, a couple friends and my gf buying this. 🤓   Plus can't wait to see what the new Pokemon rivalries.
Looks like we finally got some info on the main story, even if it’s a little vague. Koraidon/Miraidon emerge from that cloud vortex at the center of the map, I wonder why???
2:55 I see the developers have already thought about competitive applications of Terrastalizing. Fire-Scizor, Flying-Dedenne and Normal(?)-Gengar are all pretty interesting options
Gen 1 = 151 pokemon Gen8= 30 pokemon Gen9= 20 pokemon 😅
This trailer sucked, only two new pokemon forms ....
I wanted to see the starter 2nd stage evolutions but I'm glad we finally got confirmation that past & future forms are a thing I'm assuming that'll probably be how we get the hisuan forms of Pokémon sense their from the past and should also be considered past forms.
This is just disappointing
Great song in the trailer
Finally you showed the paradox form being a thing, but why on earth did you not show the starter evolutions, just show them ffs instead of half of the crap WE KNOW is in the game.
good lord that music ruined the whole trailer
Koraidonphan & Miraidonphan
This song was awesome
DEDENNE IN THE HOUSE LET'S GO
what was this trailer bro 💀💀💀
1000th recap but atleast paradox forms are pretty much confirmed now. That past form Donphan looks primal, I love it. Future is kinda ummm, weird 🤔
Booooooooo, why no starter evos
Es el mejor trailer que e visto en años
Ayooo👀🔥
Robot Elephant 🐘 is going to be mine!!
Well, so the trailer did not have anything new except a new Donphan form BUT I enjoyed it, thanks to Celestial as the BGM! :) I hope we get to see starter evos soon.
ED SHERRAN! ily
No new original pokemon, nor the starter evolutions               Pokemon co, i hope that you're saving the Starter Evos until the games Launch or god so help me!!
I'm sorry why havent we seen the starter's final form yet? i need to know who im finna pick like
2:32 Paradox Donphan
Heck yeah donphan
Why does a pokemon trailer have such inspiring/dramatic music?  So excited for this!!
Didn’t I just see a cybernetic Donphan?
was there a Donphan evo? this pokemon looks kind of sick
10 second interesting section and a trailer I had to mute. Oh well.
Donphan is my second favorite Pokémon, both are going on the team
Bag packed? Check. Pokeballs in belt? Check. Let's see oh yes Pokedex ready in pocket? Check. Alright...LETS GO!!!
It's nice hearing Celestial again. Looks like we get new forms (or evolutions) of Doniphan based on which game we play.
Ngl I'm putting dislike cuz they knew we wanted to see starter evolutions and instead got Ed Sheeran music video
Really hoping they fixed issues from Sword and Sheild cause im so excited!!!
Me:-takes off glasses- so no starter evolution?-throws phone to the floor—breaks a skateboard-.
what an abomination of a trailer, we got 2 seconds of new information, of koraidonphan and miraidonphan, where are starter evos Nintendo?
I was hoping for more but ok
Wow not a single thing I didn't already know 🙃
Ughhh...aside from the cool paradox donphan, I really wanted to see some more "new" pokemon. I really hope there are more than just the few we have seen...
WE WANT STARTER EVOLUTIONS
Omg I’m so excited for the ancient Donphan!!! It gives me oliphaunt vibes!! 😁
This new trailer didn't show much, but did anyone else notice how pretty this game looks now compared to the first trailers? Game footage not final really wasn't a lie lol
Past and Future forms of Donphan?!
I was hoping for a starter evo tease so bad! Wish this wasn't an Ed Sheeran music video and more focused on teasing or releasing evolution info.
can we fucking cut including ed sheeran in any type of game or series the fuck has he to do with pokemon
I hope showing normal TTar proves how wrong all these crappy YouTubers were lying this entire time. also seeing Donphan that confirms im getting scarlet both legendaries are sick but future donphan looks weird and if thats how they all look ill take the past forms
ARE U KIDDING ME LIKE NO NEW INFO BESIDES PARTIAL SHOTS OF THE ANCIENT AND FUTURE DONPHAN FORMS
The paradox forms are finally shown
I love Donphan because till gen 8 it was the only pokemon based on my favourite animal, so happy its getting some love by gamefreak.. I really wanted a mega for it but this looks good as well.
paradox donphan 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nice copyright striking every reaction on stream good job Ed Sherran. (ironically)
😡 it almost makes me want to blame Generation 6 because of it never had those girly things we would have evolve starters and not some song sung by some lame boy band guy
That revealed absolutely nothing. Just one pokemon.
This has innocence and wonders that make Pokemon so appealing. I love this so much.
mfw no starter evos
ed sheerhan makes music for windowlickers so it makes sense they'd put it in a severely watered down pokemon game appealing to autistics
I'm kinda mad they made a big deal out of this when we really didn't get anything new, would've been better to save this for launch
still not showing the starter evos yea gamefreak knows the evolutions suck
I'm crying
I do wish to see a Pokémon game set in the Touhoku region, and maybe a new Pokémon Ranger with the Legends: Arceus gameplay with Abilities. Anime graphics like in the Gal Gun games and the 3DS Pokémon games are great and should be used.
Too bad it had to be played on mute ):
Huh... It was just an Ed Sheeran song, how adorable.
wow,that was really exciting p.s: that was future form donphan's evolution?
adklfjjkdahfjksdhfhdj hdjkfh starter evolutions pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee fhasdjkfnajkdfnajdf
DOMPHAN!!!!!! OoO
Looking forward to this, together with my brother. Just like back in 1999. Have fun everyone. :)
Well that's 4 minutes I'll never get back. Nothing new at all except for paradox Donphan.
DONPHAN YESSS
Is that a new Donphan form? 🤔
L FKING WASTE OF TIME
So only new info is the paradox forms being confirmed? Don't think its been done like this, but would have been cool to see the middle evos for the starters and left the finals as the mystery
2:35 what happened to donphan?
Am I blind, or were there no Starter evos in the trailer?
"You're not gonna want to miss this"  *briefly shows 1 new thing
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
This was so disappointing… where are the starters?
2:32, looks like you'll be getting a regional Donphan (or I can't tell if that's an original pokemon) based off of your game. The ancient looking one belonging to Scarlet, and the technological one belonging to Violet.
No way we just got a look at paradox forms
Were those Miraidon eyes on that Donphan form?
Really excited for this. It could be the Pokémon game we've been waiting for since red and blue.
ITS JUST A STUPID SONG
okay this trailer cemented scarlet as my choice, I would love seeing ancient looking pokemon that some robotic one
2:33   Paradox Donphan confirmed!!!
Lol Ed Sheeran duck
My last Pokémon game was Sun, Violet managed to get my attention, Game Freak made so many improvements and it just looks great! 😍
Is anyone else just not properly impressed with these games yet like still feeling massively 50-50?
Woo. Looking awesome.
i love donphan yay!
Me watching this trailer: 🔇
Oh wow, nothing!
No starter evolutions here, just a (admittedly fire) song.
I'm convinced the starters dont evolve
BROOOwhere are the evolutions????
Could have just released the 6 second spot of Paradox pokemon and removed the rest
I wanna watch Ed Sheeran play this game.
They put so much emphasis on the starters in the beginning and then they don't even show their second stages lol
The dragon tera type looks good
For the first time in my life I’ve watched an ed shereen music video
Ok so still no starter evos revealed? Seriously..
Past and future pokemon confirmed
still no bug type??????
YESSS!!!! LETS GOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m picking fuecoco
They can afford Ed Sherran but can't even add voice acting to the games (which is cheaper than a famous singer) 🤦‍♂
THAT DONPHAN THOUGH! 🔥
😡 sorry to do that it's nice but
Forced me to watch an Ed Sheeran music video for nothing
so worst trailer ever well atleast we get to see donphan 3rd evolution (i guess)
Now, I'm more excited for next week!
This video would be great if they give us more new content!
Is this the first time Bronzor is version exclusive ?
Cool. Ed Sheeran singing feels like a new Pokemon having a Tera type.
Bit suprised to hear the Ed song, not heard it yet but has made the game seem refreshing
This music impowers me. Also I saw the Donphans or the Dophan wanna be.
i guess i'll just pick sprigatito since i'm not gonna see the starter's final evolutions before the game releases
I cant wait! I even booked a few days off to play. I may just do a full run in one go again
soo wheres the news they said was coming?  ?
I'm super excited! Cant' wait!
COOL DONPHAN
Yall in the comments do not know hwo to sit down and WAIT for the game to see the evolutions...calm down before you burst a damn vein.
L trailer
They could have at least showed us what the starters evolve into
Past and Future form of Donphan?!!!! THATS DOPEEEE
This trailer was so hype it actually made me listen to an ed Sheeran song
That’s it? That was just a music video
🙂 wow 🙂 one question though 😡 where are the evolutions of the starters 😡 I came to see starter evolutions not some musical album
PARADOX DONPHANS
Ed Sheeran made the audio unplayable for me. Otherwise phenomenal trailer though. :)
That looks like some Prehistoric Donphan, looks really cool!
Excited for the game. Poor choice of trailer music though.
lets gooo paradox donphan
We saw two new things…. That were paradoxes of the same pokemon…. What a waste haha
The donphans look sick 🔥🔥🔥🔥
not so hype for final trailer.. boring
No starter evo's... Pain. At least Paradox Donphan is cool, glad I'm getting Violet because Iron Treads looks cooler. Curious on if we can catch and use them though, and how we encounter them.
2:32 This is going to break the internet...
This was so clean! Cant wait
The looks of those Donphan almost confirm the leaked pokedex from the other day
Showed a new Pokemon and didn’t elaborate
Lol yet another trailer with 1 new piece of info. Nintendo is the biggest troll of them all 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please bro the starters
it feels like I was tricked into watching an AMV
glad that the one who made this trailer is possibly a team Quaxly. lol . Team Quaxly let's go!!!
Rly? Just two new forms? Thats all? 😪
too much noise for a videoclip that shows almost nothing new...
Who ever is in charge of these trailers needs to be fired ASAP. Besides one second of a new Donphan there was literally no new information of the games and it's only 10 days away.
I thought we were gonna get starter evolutions, I'm a little disappointed..
Man
FUTURE AND PAST MOMMA TRUNK!!!
There’s nothing new except one regional form like come ON?!
Seeing Koraidonphan and Miraidonphan now confirms that the list of all pokemon names online is real.
The fact this has music playing over it is just so cool I can't wait to get my copy AND WAS THAT A DONPHAN
starter evos when?
1:58 OMG MY FAVORITE POKÉMON HES THERE HES SLEEPY AWWWH
New Donaphan (and old, if you get what I mean) look sick 🤩🤩🤩
I THOUGTH THERE WAS NEW EVOS
Dragon terra type Crystal
I'm super excited for these games!
Ok, so this Is a donphan reveal. Starter final evolutions please
Waste of time
yay new donphan
dangg goosebumps!
okay so the only thing i got out of this is either an evolution or regional variant for donphan honestly kind of a disappointing trailer
Well. That was anticlimactic.
The paradox forms look absolutely gorgeous
for how much this trailer was being hyped by you we just have another fargiraf situation. a huge waste of time with a tiny bit of new info (seriously we dont even see them properly this time)
That was the trailer? Still no evolutions? Really?
...That's it? That's the final trailer of sword and shield? THAT WAS NOTHING BUT A BUNCHA CHEAP WALK CYCLES!
I was hoping towards the end to see the starter evos
WOOO PARADOX DONPHAN LETS GOOOOOO
no starters evo yet sadge
Stop wasting our time
Pachirisu..  😍
Wow 10/10 trailer
I thought we would see the starter evolutions lol
One of the things that excites me most is playing with friends in the overworld. It's a small thing, yet it sounds so fun.
2:34 NAH WHAT THE FRICK IS THIS
DONPHAN!!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOO
UNCLE PEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
2:32
Please tell me this is the opening. I'm already getting goosebumps
Yall peeped the paradox forms? 👀 👀
This song and montage made me feel things.
00:56 bro lost his Nuzlocke from the JUMP
Oof
what's up with that horrible music my dudes
Ayo nice!! 1:46 Tyranitar is attacking Donphan! Glad to see the elebuddy coming back 😊😊
Dude the game is coming out in like 2 weeks, all due respect to Ed Sheeran but seriously just gimme the starter evos
Foi só isso?
I need friends to play this with!!! AND WAS THAT A NEW DONPHAN EVOLUTION???? 😀😀😀
Nice but pointles trailer. Other than brief glimpse of Donphan, nothing new
Bruh, dat's all??
YO ANYONE NOTICE THE PAST AND FUTURE LOOKING DONPHAN
They showed a past and future version 😮
least disappointing trailer in ohio
I was no expecting celestial to be part of the trailer, but arceusdamn does it make me hyped for Scarlet and Violet
Well I know what game I am getting.
Kind of disappointed. I knew it would be an overview. Glad to see two new pokemon.
New Donaphan forms, neat.
Am I the only one that thought the music choice was odd? Lol
girlboss where are the starter evolutions???
That's it no starter evo's okay maybe next week
THAT’S IT?!
The footage looks awesome except for the notable lack of t shirts or jeans on the player character. I get that it’s a school setting but the PC doesn’t look close to ready for an adventure
Wow this trailer kind of sucked in terms of new information.
JohtoMon finally get some well deserved love lately. I enjoy where this is going
No starter evos :/
I love Pokémon so much, man.
TWO PALDEAN DONPHANS?
This was pretty epic, Dophan lookin mighty cool👍didn't expect a song haha
This music doesn't fit with Pokemon lol It's nice but its not Pokemon music
Goosebumps
This song was actually really good and it fit so well with the trailer I cant wait for these games
2 full minutes of recycled footage and literally 0.5 second of new info
This was so bad. Nothing revealed
Ahhhh these games look so fun! Can’t wait to start the adventure next Friday ❤️💜
really loving the Domphans
2 different dolphans shown, past and future.
Man I LOVE POKEMON! This trailer is just something else as well! Just 10 days left!
WAS THAT A DONPHAN EVOLUTION???
I called it let’s go new form for donphan
What if there's a 3rd legendary pokemon named Celestial. We already have celesteela
2:32 OH MY GOODNESS THE PARADOX DONPHAN LEAKS ARE REAL
I don't even like Ed Sheeran but damn.. This trailer clearly shows: WE NEED VOICED SONGS IN THE GAMES! :O
Wow they really showed us just paradox donphan in final trailer 😐
If this song plays in game I'll lose it
Well, those were almost four minutes i'm not getting back. Not a lot of news there other than ParaDonphan I suppose.
Looks like a good music video, just disappointed we didn't get any new information. Looks like Nintendo is pretty much keeping tight lipped since there was a bunch of leaks and punishing us for it.
4 minutes for only a teaser
NOT ED
Such an awesome trailer
ANCIENT DONPHAN vs CYBORG DONPHAN ❗️
No new info, just an annoying song. Thanks for the terrible trailer
The starter evolutions😭
This is the worst Pokémon trailer of all a don't care about  Ed Sheeran music i was hoping to see new Pokémon come on !!!!!!!
Donphan regional variant?!
2:09 is the closest we've ever been to seeing Enginemon move and exist and stuff, this is a momentous occasion!  Yes I am adding them to my team ASAP I will steal a thousand cars before I let my hype for the engine die
welp, time to solo the game with marill.
Cinematically, this is really well done, overall though, I was hoping for just a slight bit more than a tease at what looks like a new regional form and a new Pokemon, but this trailers pretty good!
No starter evos STILL?!?!
no starters evo?!
Donphan's new form looks SICKK. Never was a fan of him but might use it on my team now
I still don’t understand why they got ed Sheeran. Ariana literally has an eevee tattooed onto her.
E brincadeira em
AYO THOSE DONPHAN FORMS HELLO
YOOOOOO THE PARADOX DONPHAN TITAN
This wait is killing me 😭
NO
donphan though
The leaks are true...
Donphan gets a new evolutions?
Wow....why am I nostalgic for a game I've never played?
Uhhhh??? Where are the starter evolutions?????
PARADOX DONPHAN CONFIRMED!!! WOW 😍 I AM SO HYPE FOR THE 18TH 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁❤️❤️❤️
Dumbest trailer in the entire series
I was baited to listen Celestia.
it’s official. the starters don’t evolve
That new Donphan evolution looks amazing!!!!
Still no starter evos 10 days before release😑
paused the same song in spotify to open this nice
Us: When will starter evos come out Pokemon: That’s the neat part. It won’t.
Past and future donphan look amazing
Koraidonphan & Miraidonphan
PARADOX FORME REVEAL??!!?!?!??
That trailer was...a choice.
That donphan looks so awesome, I am SO excited for next Friday!
I think Im most hyped for custom rotom phone cases.
That sleeping Jolteon was all I needed to see
Paldean Donphan!!!!1111
Lame content lol the rotom phone cases compared to gift jirachi and gift mew in brilliant diamond and shining pearl.
Some people were disappointed last generation that Donphan found a rival in Copperajah. Well, this seems fairly interesting!
This wasn't a trailer, its more of a tribute to be honest
Like the past donphan more than the future one but future one is still cool, dragon terastal hat is also good
😊
Not a fan of the song
So Koraidonphan and Miraidonphan hey? 👀
Those new Donphans looking tight
What a great birthday gift the word Celestial has a lot of meaning to me
Ok but whoever picked ed sheeran made my day worse. Everything else is great tho
New pokemon 2:32
It took over two minutes to see anything new and even that was the barest hint. Did you guys really license music for this?
Looks good
I haven't been a Pokemon fan for years ❤
when are the starters being revealed
They only showed the Donphans lol
Couldn't be more disappointed. Show us the starter evolutions! We didn't ask for a crappy music video.
So no new info really and why is the song so loud
Lets go past and future form are now confirmed.
The Ed Sheeran song is beautiful! So cool he's become their biggest ambassador!
Wait, was that a past and future form donphan?
I love the new titan and I hope we will get to see the starter evos soon!
What an actual waste of time
Wish this trailer existed without the weird song
New donphan forms?
What was the donphan looking thing that looks incredible
Why do the visuals look really bad
Still no starter evolutions? They must look really bad then, lol
Again, nothing special to me. I want to see evolution of those 3 starters.
Can't wait for the Austin John vid!
2:33 new Pokemon
waste of a trailer so dumb
I cried watching this. The start of a new Pokémon adventure will always bring back unforgettable memories of simpler times. Can't wait to explore Paldea! Also the Ed Sheeran song is amazing
They're really not going to show any starter evolutions??
0:12 Awe hell naw 💀
PARADOXES!!!!!!!!
Can't wait to play with my homies!
I have been wondering, people sometimes complain about that pokemon games take so slow to change but I do not think the changes that are used in current era games would have been possible/have the same impact as today. A lot of fans have grown up with this franchise
This is beautiful... this game is gonna be so good!
*whoa,* a glorified tv spot with 2 seconds of “new” information regarding shilling other switch games and something that a leaker already spoiled in may because TPC’s lawyers are extremely incompetent?? 10 days from release? this game is gonna suck if they’re being this damn secretive about basic things like starter evos!
They're really gonna make us wait for the starter evolutions, huh?
Both Donphan forms were there! Past and Future!  So glad I pre-ordered both games
go girl give us nothing!
Can't wait! Sadly I had to mute it though, Not a fan of the artist.
Where starter evos?
Really that's all the new stuff they showed?
Two new forms for Donphan?
YO BALL GUY CASE LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
We're finally here. 30 years old and the thought of a new journey always get me 🥹
Simply. Remarkable. ✨
THE DONPHAN ?!!!!!
So the thing about evolutions that change depending on what game is true huh
NEW DONPHAN FORMS!!!!
Wow they've shown restraint and not shown any start evolution. Good on them!
Another generation. I’m ready for it
Amazing
I’m so hyped for this game!
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
that’s it?
ROBOT DONPHAN!!!
That donphan looks sick 😳
LETS GOOOOO!
THE NEW DONPHANS !!!
Mecha donphan??
The Donphan forms 👀👀
garbage trailer, literally nothing we didn't already know except donphan.
IM SCREAMING AND POINTING AT DONPHAN,,,, MY ALL TIME FAVROITE POKEMON EVER ,,, THIS IS CATERING TO ME SO MUCH IM GOING TO CRY THANK YIOU
So I remember there are three stories where you can  choose one of them. How do we choose ? Bc I wanna do the gym challenges
New Donphan evolution? NEW DONPHAN EVOLUTION?!
Pikachu has its 8 bit voice ? Ugh
We just gonna glaze over the Donphan evo, maybe two of em?!?! One future one past.
I'm convinced the starters this generation do not evolve.
THE DONPHAN???
Where are the evos.
Bruh that DONPHAN?!?!
10 more days to go can't come sooner enough ;~;
Imagine the people who just realise that ed sheeran write song with pokemon company
I’m not the only one that saw the Past/Future forms for Donphan, right?
That was... wow. Just. Wow.
Those Donphan (evos?) are SICK.
Amazing animation
I can't believe I just got tricked into waking up early to watch an Ed Sheeran music video made entirely of reused pokemon trailer clips
ed sheeran is my favorite pokemon
I love Ed Sheeran!! Amazing song 😍
ed said drunk
2:34 donohan?
Sooooo… no starter evos?
Pokemon needs some SHOFU music
I’m buying Scarlet on opening day after my school play’s second night.
DONPHAN!
2:36 Future form donphan
Pretty neat!
Just started watching the trailer! Excited to see what it has to offer!!!
Sooooo… no starter evos?
2:32 The so-called Paradoxes...
Bruh
I need the Final evolution of the Starter Pokemon
I just wanted the evolutions😭😭
Eww what’s with the horrible song? Would rather hear music from the game…
That's it????
Still no starter evolution. 😞
Was that a donophan evo
Ayo what were those donphan??
Shows past and future form.... hold on, we ain't gonna just blow past that like you ain't show it.
For some reason, I'm getting massive nostalgic feelings with this song whilst watching this.
Uhhh, it looks amazing! :D
I'm not one to be negative, but this was an awful trailer. Thank you for putting everything we already know except the two donphans, waste of 4 mins jeez.
There’s 4 minutes I won’t get back
I can't wait to capture that Paradox Donphan.
Finally, those different forms are kinda officially leaked.
What a useless trailer, showing nothing like always, just leak the damn game instead
Bet
Why are the legendaries just taxis
THE PARADOXES!!! THE PARADOXES ARE REAL!!!!
We waited for this?!
Bad no starter evolution. Same trailer no hype. We want to see à New pokemon New gameplay no recycle trailer please !
I have a bad feeling about this game
The Adventure on Paldea is about to Begin Soon!
So the only new thing is donphan forms in this trailer
Didn’t expect the paradox pokemon
They really snuck in paradox Pokémon in the trailer
this was . an ed sheeran music video not a trailer I was FOOLED
y'all took away pikachu and eevees voices lol
PARADOX DONPHAN
I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt. They're probably going to show us the starter evolutions later today.
Well that was disappointing
I really enjoyed the song in this trailer, looking forward to playing this game next Friday.❤️
Well then
Oh hey, the Donphans. Awesome tease there.
Ok, so nothing new really compared to all of the other trailers...?
Another trailer with nothing shown off ☠️
Oh for goodness sake, just show us the final Starter evolutions already!
Donphan future form???
Well that was a catching song but not much new information
LETS FREAKING GOOO! I LOVE Donphan and Phanphy, to see new variants is mind blowing!!!
Regional donphan?????? Oh my god screw the phone cases,oh it looked so cool
looks like Donphan is going to have an alternate form! it's one of my favorite Pokemon, so that's awesome news
The Paradox Donphans were cool
Still no fairy type terrastralize :(
2:33 Weird Donphan-looking thing, I repeat, weird Donphan-looking thing!
that was disappointing
Well that was pointless
Ben
This was super cute! thanks 💗
Well... I'm glad we at least saw the past and future Donohan that was hinted in the leaks.
Momeny
That was nice and all, but what about the starter evos? Show them.
This was the worst trailer yet. Still nothing new and a horrible song.
No starter evolutions?
No starter evos really?
Okay, this is good!
I love getting drunk on stars with my pokemon
still no final evolutions… that’s literally all we want.
ed sheeran what are you doing here
Not this cringe song in Pokémon ☠️💀
PARADOX
DONPHAN FORMS?
Im so hyped! Cant wait to explore Paldea!
Loooks mid
The rotom phone cases are cool
Oooh Donphan’s paradox forms!
W-Was that a Donphan at 2:32-2:37?
That really was a Pokémon trailer ever
Dude...this was not worth the wait.
nothing new?😅 worst trailer ever. just a corny music video
They never gonna show the starter evolutions huh
So... A very brief glimpse at Donphan, and nothing else. Very cool
Hearing ed song over this trailer goosebumps
Donphan.!?!?!
Release it one week earlier, thanks
All I want to know is how the starter evolutions looks like… 💀
Freaking? A damn music video of all things. Making it really tempting to cancel the preorder
Past form !!!!
Well that showed absolutely nothing.
still no starter evos
Welp this looks cool but im playin this silently cuz aint no way im listenin to Ed Sheeran
Hopefully this song is only in the trailer and not in game coz my ears are bleeding
FINALLY A NEW TYPE
Pokémon at its finest
Let’s gooooooo!
L trailer sorry
Bruh will it kill them to just show the starter evos
show us the starter evos already 😭😭
Hold on was that a Donphan evo?????
Wow, look, nothing!
Donohan future and past only no starter evos 😭😭😭
Damn finally paradox forms
Dope  BALL GUY IS IN SCARLET AND VIOLET I LOVE MY LIFE
Big daddy Donphan
Y’all I am so excited for Pokémon scarlet and Violet
The Donphan shown in this trailer really stands out to me.   Not just referring to the leaks that is.
IM 2 EXCITEDDD !!! ✨✨✨
Love seeing the same pokemon footage with a terrible Ed Sheeran song playing in the background
I can't believe The Pokemon Company made a GMV/AMV!!  Jokes aside, this reminds me of Sword and Shield Brand New World video.
That was it huh……
that version of donphan looked epic it might be a regional variant for violet
New Donphan form! Its about time my boy gets some love
Stream Electric by Katy Perry ⚡️
2:34 And there it is. The Paradox Pokémon that have been rumored for awhile.
what a useless trailer
So this was it..?
wait was that Paldean Donphan?
Y'all sound like bots, where are the real people? 😂
Good trailer. Wish they would show anything new tho besides 1 pokemon
Futuristic Donphan??!?
Paradox!!!!
Another trailer, another non-info drop. I’ll stick with the leaks for information on this game since tpc can’t be bothered
not even a full body shot of the future and ancient donphans, and thats it huh
Wow! Ed Sheeran And Pokémon?! 🤯🤯🤯
When 4chan leaks do a better job of hyping people up than your million-dollar marketing campaign.
im just going to point out my name is "Scarlett" and my lil sisters name is "Violet" and were watching Pokemon rn 😂 its hilarious
gay
I have really high hopes for this game!
This is so cool!
DONPHAN HYPE LETS GOOO
There was 151 comments before I commented. Just like the amount of Pokémon from Gen 1.
Your kidding another recap "Trailer" hey but that new donphan looks decent
So nothing important
Cant wait to get this for me and my siblings
PARADOX DONPHAN BOOOOOOOIIIISSSSSSS
Can’t wait to make sandwiches and see what Donald Duck’s final evolution looks like!
Still waiting to see the evolutions of the starters
YOOO paradox Donphan looks sick
Basically just the things we know but a so called music video and nothing crazy exciting like the final evolutions for the starters and the legendaries' typing... this better be worth the wait because I'm having doubts rn. Okay sure. Regional Donphan. But still. We expected more of a presentation..
Donphan form,only new thing here i think
So glad the Pokemon company spent enormous amounts of money on collaborations with A list musicians instead of R&D and expansion of Pokemon centers outside of Japan.
Another trailer with no starters!! Wooo!!
Same trailer we’ve seen but with music haha
Such a disappointment I wanted to see the starter evolutions. 💀
I’M SO HYPED AND EXCITED! I JUST CAN’T HIDE IT! AND I LOVE THIS SONG!
Lol nothing new what trolls
Barely any new information, what a disappointment.
I still don’t understand why Pokémon still has no voice acting
This trailer ain't got me hype; where the reveals
Those donphan looking though 😮
Why is Pikachu using its old cry tho?👀
I pity all the live streamers… the DMCA's will hit hard
Donphans my fave poke omg
looks great
Thanks and safety to ya all as always!!
Paradox Donphan
I am so excited for these games.
Is it just me or the game looks a lot better than before??
cool trailer
That's it???? You didnt even show us anything new - like maybe the final evos for the starters???? Omg, I have a feeling this game is gonna be another disappointment smh
Is that Ed Sheeran? Thats so cool!
The song is still so stupidly generic.
We are inching closer to greatness
love the song 🎵 ❤️ 💕 😍
Who's hype to play this game 🎮
Looks like a great game! I hope the community doesn’t ruin it!
Not New pokémon 0/10
MAN IM SO HYPED
Didn't expect to be met with ed Sheeran today
Wooo been a while! Can’t wait to get my hands on this.
awesome trailer so cool
no starters boooo
where is the starters evo
Would have been better if they spent the money on voice acting instead of Ed Sheeran.
Thats it?
Interesting, but don't care for now
Just a few more days!!
Watching on mute, can't believe they let a guy like Ed Sheeran in this :(
But how about Showing us the starter Pokemon Evolutions lines already.

Didn't think Ed Sheeran would be singing but ok! Not a fan but it's still cool!
The song makes me not want to watch this, or even buy the games
THEY GAVE PIKACHU ITS OG CRY...NANNNIIIII
Why do i get toothless vibes from koriadon? Anyone else???
Ed Sheeran is a fat L never playing Pokemon again grr
INCREDIBLE! FINALLY EXITED FOR A NEW POKEMON GAME!
Why doesn't pikachu or evee have their voice wher they announce their name?
Like the song.
PLEASE LISTEN TO OUR ED SHEERAN SONG PLEASE HE LIKE THE ORANGE FLYING DRAGON PLEASE LIKE HIM

The trailer/game would be so much better without Ed Shereen
See you in Paldea!
