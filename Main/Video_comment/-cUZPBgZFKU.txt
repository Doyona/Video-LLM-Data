Anyone knows the brand and type of that heavy jump rope from event 11?
Who else is here to watch Lazar win his Reebox bonus? After watching Vellner's story about this event, I had to come watch it! RIP Lazar!
Came back and watched this after Pat's story. ❤ Lazar you were an amazing athlete. We will love you and keep you in our hearts forever.
Who’s here after vellners post 😭😭
Came here after hearing Pat Vellner's favourite story with Lazar. Event 10 2:20:17
The athletes are amazing ,such fitness is rare....Wish more black people will also be giving oppurtunity
4,8 km + 90 t2b in 20 min? Is this distance right?
medics were so slow to attend to brooke if i was a medic i would run even if an athlete had a fricken splinter
What is the commentator talking about? He been wrong the whole competition trying to guess what these  Crossfitters are going to do. Just Shut up man .  J. Medieros aint go toe to toe with Matthew Fraser either.. Nobody goes toe to toe with the  Great Matt Fraser! lol Fraser had a 500 point lead last year!
I wonder if Tia gets fed up answering questions about Mat in these interviews??
This sport is truly amazing souls who don't accept boundaries appeal to me
Tía clair exelen 🏋️‍♂️💪
CBS or NBC lost out big time by not showing these CrossFit Games this was an Epic year!!!❤️👍💪🚀
Do the commentators watch the show? During the women's event 12 tie-breaker for 5th place, they were like "we have to see what happened". You could clearly see, that there was a no-rep given
Cary and O'Brien are gonna be athletes to watch for sure!
Tia's 6 pack on the T2B is insane!
Like
Danielle got robbed at that snatch
My favourite moment was when Anni lifted the 200 barbell. Her face - Preceious
TIA IS A GREAT ATHLETE BUT ANNIE WAOOO
They all have such good lifting form and such terrible running form. It's so hard being strong for big lifts but then also light and flexible in the hips for the running.
Can we get a petition going to get Chase ingraham to shut the fuck up during events. Way too much over analyzing.
I love watching these athletes compete. Tia-Clair is one of my favorites to watch as I think she is the ultimate competitor. I loved watching Fraser for the same reason. They go to the places physically and mentally that no one wants to go. Very fun to watch.
There are 30 great athletes in each heat. Can we get the camera off just Tia. It’s not what the fans are here for and give all the athletes the respect and air time they have earned please.  I have al last seen no other female athletes and this is a great field of old favourites and fresh new competitors.
Tia paces: she’s like a lion in a cage Malheiros paces: ok settle down buddy
That looked like a dislocation for Brooke.. damn
If the workout was done previously at the CrossFit Games could you have the WR (world record) time shown at the top so we can see them race each other and the previous best time?
Don't know if Danielle Brandon was smart for not using protective support during the snatch event.
Commentary in these events is down right amateurish and sycophantic. I haven't heard a single commentary that is productive or critical.
man brooke well is out for 2022 crossfit games too im thinking
I wish they would do this event first so we can see what they can really do
The Crossfit games are the most intense and incredible form of fitness I've ever been involved with and enjoy!  I love and respect all the athletes and time spent perfecting themselves and/or team involvement.  Stay strong and healthy!!💪
How many of these athletes pass a drug test?
listen to this to get good vibes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBSnMCNU-Pc
Adams reminds me of warriors in  Vikings!
Im so in love with Davidsdottir

5:52:01 Does anyone know where I can find those "exact" big under the knee wraps she has? Can't find them in Amazon. I can only find wraps for all the knee(over & under) or a very thin band for under the knee, but not big/thick like hers. Thank you in advance
TIA !!  ❤🏆🏆🏆🏆

I love Tia!!! So inspirational!!!
Food stalls though
Samantha Briggs is my inspiration
TIA & DUKIC <3 <3 <3
So much juiceage on that field.
At this point, even Sean Woodland must be wanting Chase to shut the F up.
Desculpa aí Mundo 🌎.... mas o Gui Malheiros é do 🇧🇷.... Monstrão do Snatch .... simplesmente quebrou a banca.... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🍀👍

Uno de los argumentos estrella del feminismo es por qué si una mujer está con muchos hombres es una guarra pero si un hombre está con muchas mujeres es un campeón, *por la dificultad* hasta la mujer más fea y poco atractiva tiene varios hombres solitarios detrás de ella dejándose mangonear por un poco de atención pero en cambio cada vez más hombres llegamos a la mitad de nuestra vida sin haber conseguido encontrar pareja ni tener ninguna experiencia amorosa con ninguna mujer *por la dificultad* se llama HIPERGAMIA y las mujeres tenéis el privilegio de poder elegir entre varios pretendientes, nos comparáis y despreciáis a los que menos os aporten. Me entristece mucho esa doble moral con lo de estar en contra de los cánones de belleza... las gordas se quejan de que los hombres se interesan por ellas y los gordos son tan ignorados que el día que se suiciden solo se enterarán sus madres. Por eso si una chica está con muchos hombres es solo cuestión de dejarse llevar y aceptar las propuestas de los hombres necesitados en cambio para que un hombre esté con muchas mujeres o está claramente por encima de la media o tiene mucha suerte *aún así  la promiscuidad es un cáncer para cualquier sociedad* porque las mujeres competís y os repartís al porcentaje de los hombres con buen físico, dinero y carisma pero hay otro porcentaje cada vez mayor de hombres solterones tristes a los cuales el "terrible patriarcado" solo les ofrece trabajar para poder pagar cosas con las cuales entretenerse o el suicidio, de cada 10 personas que se suicidan 8 son hombres.

Anyone know what Wells was laughing at 7:18:37?
Hi
*It's time to repent and seek JESUS* .He gave his life, and suffered the wrath of the Father in the cross, to save you from a eternal hell. For God loves you, but the sin must be punished. On the third day He raised from the death, showing to the world that He is God. So stop sinning and clean your life. He returns soon to judge and destroy the sinners. *Read the Bible.* *THE END IS NEAR.*
More interesting than the Olympics.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

I love Annie, she is so cute!
I love Annie, she is so cute!
Are you going to be splitting up these full day streams into event videos like last year?
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Annie is so lovely
Poor Brook Well hope she is fine
A lot of these no-rep squats in event 11 were actually legit squats. I guess some of the judges got caught up in the moment.
Gui 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 💥🚀
Annie and tia show down! Wish I was there!
Damn poor Brooke! Looks like her elbow slipped out. Hopefully it is just that and that the bone did not actually break. Plus she got hit in the head. 😰😰😰😢😢😢 Get well soon Brooke!! ❤️❤️❤️
Re 1 rep max:  Tia T. started the Crossfit Games as an extraordinarily talented minnow and has forged herself into a laser-focused shark. Annie T. is an Icelandic princess: beautiful, powerful and still having fun. A real joy to watch these two.
https://youtu.be/EeYeOOQi2pg
NEVER TAKE THE {REVERSED} ENICCAV THAT MAY BE GIVEN. IT IS A  {REVERSED} DNAB DIA.  GO TO  {REVERSED} MOC.HOEV  ENTER IN SEARCH ENGINE  {REVERSED} RD EIRRAC JEDAM  WATCH 21 MINUTE VIDEO.  WORDS HAVE TO BE REVERSED. i AM BEING SHADOW BANNED ACROSS THE INTERNET.  NEVER TAKE THIS {REVERSED}  ENICCAV.   JESUS  CHRIST IS YOUR ONLY ANSWER TO WHAT IS TO COME.
Watching the games make me wanna train harder! Haha
B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior. No peace without repentance and resurrection.
💛If your reading this:  BE BLESSED x 1,000,000,000!  😊😊🙏🙏💛💛😊😊🙏🙏😊😊💛💛💛😊😊🙏🙏😊😊💛💛😊😊🙏😊😊💛💛😊😊
Come on at least you could commend Laura Hovarth on her best performance as well, she's second fittest for goodness sake
7:39:58
It's not 'Day-vids-dawter' it's 'Daaa-veths-doh (like homer simpson)-ttir'.  Also, shoutout to all the Irish names out there (Siobhan, Niamh , you know who you are)  Commentators could do a better job.
Listening to Chase Ingrham criticize the athletes snatching 270+ lbs is like listening to a couch potato criticize Olympic gymnasts for missing their landing. As if it's always so easy to just stick a 270 snatch.
how much money of buying Facebook user private information?
I love your videos! Stay safe everyone 🤩🤩
Including vaccination! Vaccination for more than 60% of the people is the bottom line will reach group  immunization!
I think That the worse thing that have crossfit games it is the cameras, sorry for my english
Look…https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjPEObcw6E
“Mom, can we get Olympics?” “No son, we have Olympics at home.”  Olympics at home:
LOL Chase couldn't hold his excitement when Tia failed the 205 lift
Crossfit is all about the ability to lose gains
Better than Olympics 💥💥
Honestly, can we stop calling a 1.5 mile run a "LONG DISTANCE". Even for these guys/girls that's not long distance, but especially for runners it's nothing.
I don't  think Danielle Brandon No-repped. I think that was a bad call. Unless that judge saw the plates not touch after the first rep, it should be counted. But hey....good job to those ladies either way.
just to put the best 140 kg snatch at the open in perspective, here's the world record snatch https://youtu.be/ie1eJ11g_tE?t=1602
ok
he
Today was a good day ,chickstrip basket from DQ was a hit👌🏼and This girl I been wanting to talk to said she is free tomarrow💪🏼what do i say y’all🤯 … take her out to eat/invite her over/go somewhere chill/ext… I wanna make sure I do this one right yall💯
GOOD NEWS; There is Resurrection,  Eternal life and forgiveness of ALL previously committed sins in Jesus Christ. It is witnessed and recorded that "Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures" (1 Corinthians 15:3-4) AND "If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame." (Romans 10:9-11) TURN AWAY FROM WRONG DOING AND BELIEVE THE GOOD NEWS.
Wait I'm confused is this the Olympics? Tickle tickle tickle!😻❤️
HOPE IN LOVE 🌹🕊🌹 Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved.  Saved from the punishment of sin.  I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!!  No more pain, dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc...  offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ.  We must be willing to turn from sin and to believe the Gospel, Mark 1:15 to receive Jesus forgiveness.  He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 Visual Bible movies on YouTube. Matthew, Acts, Luke, John    💜👑✝️📖nkjv 🧎‍♂️ 🙏🙂🇺🇸
Heavenly Father I pray that you keep the person reading this alive, safe, healthy and financially blessed amen
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. 🎈
CHEATERS!!!! We would have gotten yelled at for using our legs in wrestling practice. Next progression? Strict peg board climbs. Straight legged with socks.
Prayers for Brooke Wells 🙏🙏 hope she gets well soon

They should have named the event with the worm, The Castro! He’s the biggest worm at the games. What a clown!
TODA VEZ QUE ALGUÉM REAGIR A ESSE COMENTÁRIO VOLTAREI E ASSISTIREI O VÍDEO +10 VEZES 🎶😀😚..
https://youtu.be/KZCkoByZZUo Camila Cabello new song you'll love it 💕
the strength of fikowski on the snatch.
Scott could be top 3 if he was 100% ❤️
Something diff surely happens with vellner
Danielle Brandon OMG has just become my New Sexiest Crossfit alive.
Can they please interview someone else then Tia. I love her but she wins everything, give some of the other athletes the chance to talk.
7:39:58.   Brooke
castro is like the virus, fkr is everywhere
Those announcers wanted Horvath to win that Peg Board event so Bad.  Tia said nope...
please stop talking …. boring and most of the time nonsense
Why do they keep comparing Tia's event wins with Mat's event wins?  That is like comparing apples and oranges. The men and women compete separately so their records should be separate.
🙏🏿🙏🏿💜🙏🏿🙏🏿#BrookWells🙏🏿🙏🏿💜🙏🏿🙏🏿
These announcers are pretty dumb, lifters don't make you any better it's just preference for the athletes.
🎌
The lamentable yogurt naturalistically produce because angora phylogentically pump per a lucky marimba. deafening, previous brake
Anyone notice helgadottir at 7:43:11 😂😂
ma come li fa questi snatch malheiros e fenomenale
Awesome effort Jay Crouch.:) :)
Ugh, will reduce my weight in the snatches after seeing Brooke. God, I hope she will be healed again for next year.
Much more interesting than the Olympics.  Too bad so few people watch this
Malheiros was lifting like it was nothing. Amazing job from the Brazilian
7:48:17 The fact that you can see both Snatch Lifts side by side and they look EXACTLY THE SAME. One referee calls a no rep while the other referee call is it a rep, is fucked up. That Male Referee screwed D. Brandon up. He took his job way to fucking serious while the female Referee just let the her athlete do her thing and compete. Fire that man!
OMG the judge of the tie breaker.. sigh..  Haley Adams shouldve won that tie breaker..
Malheirossssss 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Crossfit is the greatest sport in history. I said it. Forget what anyone says about other sports being greater. Crossfit is where it's at. After watching Annie go into tears 😢?  This has to be the best sport in the world.
Chase Ingram compares snatch to shooting a free throw into a golf hole lolololol remove this guy please!!
5:39:59
the medical team could have been faster..... my heart broke when I saw brooke crying what the fuck
What has become clear this year is that Matt Fraser usually sets the pace and everyone follows, with him gone no one is stepping up to set the tone, and despite all the marketing (as per usual) with Noah, he is no where to be seen on podium, proving my point that he isn't a champion, hell of a competitor but not a champion- not yet. I don't think he has the mindset to get the job done in all honesty. At this level that is literally the game, who is mentally tougher.
we'd appreciate it if you show other contestants other than Toomey in women individual events. I mean she is great and all, but there are athletes we'd like to see their performance too.
Women's event is getting boring. Tia always wins. There's no need for a competition anymore.
Is Brooke Wells okay?
Where is it from
Hello how are you
I love Annie, she is so cute!
Praying for Wells.
Brooke! 😭 7:40:00
Sending prayers to Brooke Wells 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 Shes worked so hard and I feel bad after seeing this.
Coach B to special guest commentate, or one of his family, please CrossFit - 1rm oly lifts. Teamed with Sean & maybe Annie :) would be a vibe
If there was a fan's choice moment, it would be to have Chandler Smith and Samantha Briggs continue on.
8:57:00
Thank you CrossFit!
Poor brooke🥺
I think Clarence would smash the crossfit events if he trained for it
Damn poor Brooke! Looks like her elbow slipped out. Hopefully it is just that and that the bone did not actually break. Plus she got hit in the head. 😰😰😰😢😢😢 Get well soon Brooke!! ❤️❤️❤️
that was the worst response by a medical team ive seen in awhile
It should be first come first served as you re-enter the grounds, you are at a disadvantage if you are the farthest away...
The announcers fuck up A LOT.  Is there no prep either between them or crossfit itself?
CrossFit Surbiton and Annie did AMAZING! Loved Annie's comment; "to be honest, I have no idea what that is in kilo's so I have no idea what I just did😂" her smile and overall attitude are amazing! And it is an idea to put the weights in kilo's and the lengths in meters somewhere as well, for all the non USA athletes and viewers!
I know it’s a competition, but some of these athletes could tell the others “hey! Check your form and take your time!”
Adding point for discussion... does anyone think that contenders like kari, bethany, and now brooke is going to take away from the legitimacy of Adam's placing....🤷🏾
Loved then snatch event!
Praying for Brooke... =(
CrossFit summed up in one sentence. “A mile and a half is a long run” 😂🤣
How come I can’t watch from the start of the day ?
It’s a shame the games had to compete with the Olympics this year, not having a consistent cable channel work with the sport really hurts the viewership
Brooke is just a perfect example of the danger and lack of consideration for the athlete the sport has
Sam Briggs was built in a lab, one of the best overall athletes for almost a decade now
So proud of Guilherme, 3 incredible wins! Cheers from Brasil
Chris Henshaw is too partial to Mayhem athletes.    Its so annoying
For anyone wondering , time stamp is 2:10:27
Sherryl Crow did not write The First Cut Is The Deepest. This loser. Show Cat Stevens some respect. Absolute clown sideline commentator.
Because things shouldn’t be harder than they have to be…  Team event 8: 27:15 : team (only heat)  Team event 9 1:04:24: team (only heat)  Individual Event 10 1:42:03 women (only heat) 2:22:08 men (only heat)  Team event 10: 4:45:57 team final heat   Individual Event 11 5:41:10 women final heat 6:16:02 men final  heat  Individual event 12 6:59:52 women (only heat) 8:05:32 men  (only heat)
After watching Brooke I’m good to not snatch for awhile. Hopefully she’s alright.
Where is the video footage of Individual events 8/9? On FB & here on YT it seems to jump right to 10?
Brooke 🥺
I get team mayhem are great and all but it would be nice to see other teams... just a thought.
The fact the the announcers were unsure of the weights on the bars at times was saddening...smh
Time stamps would be nice
I hope Brooke is okay! I know she probably won’t continue with the weekend unfortunately but I am praying for a speedy recovery! She did awesome this year! ❤️

what the heck is going on with the Day at the Games updates after the events? Are you guys not doing those any longer?
