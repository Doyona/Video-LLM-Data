How predictable this was? Now religion isn't that cool anymore 💤
Bruh needs get in the gym

“Jesus I love you but uh…. Rents due” -probably Jidion
A true example of how a money can control a person

Bro realized money is more important than god💀💀💀
Rent wont pay itself 😔🙏
Christ ain’t shit.
God is a delusion bro. Go back to what you enjoybdoing.
This mfs officially a sellout
bro realised after debating with muslims that christanity is not reall be stopped being a christian 😂😂😭
mandem ruined his reputation so fast
Boo you stink
he's broke.
IM IN THE ZOO WITH LIONS, APES AND BEARS
I was actually really depressed when you left, I was taking DXM and smoking every day, before eating, before going to sleep even just randomly if I felt bored, It had nothing to do with you leaving just some unfortunate timing, life has just been tough man and it didn't help that one of my favourite YouTubers left so suddenly, I even tried hurting myself (didn't like it so I stopped). I used to come home and put on a video of yours while I ate dinner, it really helped ease me out of the day, even rewatched a few if you didn't upload yet. anyways dude, I'm super happy to have you back, I love you man, thanks for coming back. 😭❤️❤️
Jesus thank god I thought YT was finna fall off
It’s not that he misses yall it’s for the money
Don’t go back brother
one thing i came to realize He’s every single persons Lord and Savior, it just depends who does it with no shame all the way through.
Jesus cults must not pay the bills
don't separate the god stuff...weave it into your main content!
So sell ya soul for the  green ??😂😂
Why can’t bro just come back without hate like dam 😭😭
WWWWWW
Stay with God my friend
I was waiting for this lol. Gotta pay that rent. Welcome back fam 😅
Let's go back.  What a fake!!!!
Miss the money that I make from you guys more like
ehh…. i guess welcome back bro
That’s how you know he didn’t go Orthodox - he came back…
Keep spreading the word 🙏 love you brother
No pranks = no money💀
we all went through that faze (idk if i spelt that right) where we tried to find the next up and coming prankster on youtube, i know i found the one, his name is… FRANKIE LONIGRO!!!!!!
It's not the same, should've just stayed gone.
HE'S BACK OMGMGMG 😭🙏
Still keep spreading and believing in Jesus tho man
How much he weigh now lol
You can still entertain and be Christian. Who said laughter isn’t from God as long as it’s clean and not inappropriate. God bless you brother ❤
Nahhhh bro wants to come back 💀💀
im sad but ill see where this goes
Yesssssssssss I’m so happy
Lamest
This right here is the final perfect form of JiDion
Jidion im confused bro, the video you made about doing bad "HomieSe... " jokes and how wrong it was, then you use the title as a joke around the same subject... did you change your mind about those jokes or something?
:( it makes me sad he wont prank anymore
Oh the grift didn’t pay off? Cool
What happens with god brother
This is just sad dude
I'm so glad he's back😭😭❤🇿🇦
editor needs a raise this is fire 🔥
Bro just get a real job
U should do harmless pranks
bro deleted all his videos and theres dozens of punk white kids making money off the reuploads, This man has no sense
well this is the only vid im going to watch from him. this man is a hypocrite you stopped when you were at your peak. you had a decent reason for it. and how it was bad for you and god was lookin at you in a bad light. but all of a sudden when your pockets are low you are making new vids and trying to go back to the old you with out the pranks. when you said you were done with it all, you are now the definition of a sell out. i was so mad when you made the first vid of you leaving yt. but honestly the fact you are making a "comeback" for "money" even if it wasnt for money i wouldnt care. you made all these reasons on why you couldnt contiune making yt vids on this channel and you just went back on your word for views and money. which i get. if you woulda made this video weeks or months after the first one than i would be happy. but ive processed and lived life with out ur vids. and honestly life is better with out them. and honestly you arent going to have the views or the following you did before. because everyone has either forgot about you. or they just dont wanna watch this bs anymore. and im 50/50 but im 100% on not watching you anymore. my friend you are a sellout and people say i should hope for the best for you but honestly fuck that i hope for the worst and i hope you have a bad day and stub ur toe on the corner of the wall.
yay wtf why am i 4 months late to this !!!
I'm so proud of you Jidionnnn
But the prayers for rent being paid didn’t come thru bro?!?!
Guy seems slow, speaking weird
Big back big back
well there are still lizzo's to be saved tho just sayin maybe a lil christian prank? just saying. now i go find dah baby maybe its in the corner..🔍
I’m 18 now jiddy
Daddyyysse home😍😍😍
jesus cant pay the bills.
gods plan
god dont pay rent lmfao
So the devil is right 🤔
He knew God ain't pay the bills
Coming back to entertain because you miss us is nice and all, but as a man of God, once you cut out the worldly stuff and come to Christ, there is no going back. You have to be 100% Christ. Not 90% and 10% pleasing others. You may think you can maintain this for now, but eventually, that one entertainment video will turn into many, while the channel that was preaching about God, which didn't have much notoriety as this channel, would be left behind. In short, you'd inevitably backslide if you continue to allow the things that made you sin before even remotely close back in your life no matter how innocent it may be. People are going to hate me for this, but I feel you need to know this if you don't know already. And don't think it's just you, we all struggle with being 100% for Christ these days, but we can get there.
The vibe don’t even feel the same lol…… Idk if I wannna keep watching especially since we’re not getting pranks
Dude gained a ton of weight
Respect for people praying 🙏🏽 but as soon as I heard Jesus I turned the video off… I’ll watch all his old videos instead. 🫶🏽😢
Hope u good bro
i always knew this man was godless
I'm confused. No one said you ever had to stop making funny videos...but just don't do sinful stuff. It's not that hard. Just don't compromise your morals for money. But this video title, why do that?
He doesn’t miss us he misses paying his bills
So no more pranks?
what is this tnickels energy
I love his pranks please keep doing it
Frauddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
i miss old jidion
Where prank
YouTube is good quick money, if you make YouTube money at the level of Jidion and still cannot build a real world legit business out of it you kind of a loser (which most youtubers are outside of youtube and pranking people). This is not hate on Jid just all YouTubers (well most)
I can see Jidion going out there and preaching the word of God. Go from being a menace for the Kingdom of Darkness to being a menace to the Kingdom of Darkness.
Yessss
Long story short, He was broke
Bruh hes basically gonna use us for a lil bit of money wit lower quality content
They way u said funny money did not sound saved
When bro said pranks I almost unsubscribed
BRO WHEN I HEARD PRANKSS
a little too late bro. Good luck
Do Christian pranks
This guy is a fucking clown for this, delete all the videos just to come back destroying his own fan base🤡
The moneys too good
Fell off live life to bad he fell off
Greatest downfall I’ve ever seen on YouTube
plz play the intro
so you basically ended your career for christ, then came back a few months later dismissing the whole religion thing for money which feels even worse.
😂
Yeah come back fuck that
Please don’t give up your faith for fame I been with you ever since the boxing videos and you changed my life by giving your life to Christ. I love the positivity videos just please don’t go back to that negative prank stuff bro bro
Money is your God you weak specimen enjoy your life but remember you can only serve one master .
We missed you too  Jidion we need these laughs
Money talks you feel me
I don’t understand what’s so morally wrong with pranks
Typical YouTuber sees money for the first time thinks he dont need to work anymore than comes back when the money runs out. Just like oprahside. Fake af
Good to see u back
bro gotta pay the bills some how
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🔥🔥🔥
The goat is back
how to kill a channel lmfaoo. BYE!
All it took was one tax season for him to realize he needs to come back to YouTube to make that money back! Lmaoo!! I miss this guys videos tho so im hyped!
Welcome back man. I was confused on why you left originally considering the fact that you can still make reactions and gameplay and still be a man a god. But welcome back
Nahhh
in the title there's a joke about coming out of the closet but in your last video on the main channel you said you would drop all the inappropriate innuendos to bring yourself closer to Christ?
Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins Commit to a relationship with God and Jesus Christ before it’s to late God bless you and I love you, Jesus Christ will save your soul,Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Romans 10:10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.Jesus Christ will change anyone ,your choice
When are the letsplays coming? Also you should do horror games thats really entertaining
@JidsBurner❗️🫵🏼  Nah, something’s off… in all honesty. I’ve never watched any of your content, I just heard about you *today,* because of *@RossCreation’s* “funeral” that he made for you, “as a joke”. That’s what made me do a little bit of researching on you. Regardless of that, this feels off, simple as that. We all have bills to pay, bills don’t stop coming, obviously. It’d have been more genuine and authentic if you just said that you came back *MAINLY* for the money, and second for your fans… that would’ve felt far more meaningful.
Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins,Commit to a relationship with God and Jesus Christ your choice no pressure,in Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. in John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior, he died on the cross for our sins,God bless you and I love you,Your choice
so did he not actally come back?
Keep the faith man
👐🏾
God never said dont do something you dont like right?😂
Congratulations on turning to Christ good luck making more content
🤦🏾 U can be Christian and rich at the same time yk that right?   Basically what i mean is u shouldve kept doing what you were doing before and js focused on the lord in ur own time bc money is something we all need almost as much as the Lord
The one thing I think we need is you to go see Tyrone and not prank him just genunly say sorry for being a menace
He just feels off can you at least in private your old videos so I can watch
Hey man you good we don’t need you for pranks we got lofe still. I’m joking just keep doing gaming and reactions keep up man
Nah like I’m happy to see you again but Christian you isn’t the same, we miss the old you and we hope you can actually come back soon
Dude realised no one wanted to watch his Christian videos and needed some money
bro said he regrets his se+ual jokes but puts this title not even hatin or sum
You should pray for strangers in public
Bud is acting mad corny
brooooooo
6k views a video on the gideon account not paying the bills?
Pls just do vlogs or something like that. You dont have to do pranks, you could still be out entertaining people.
Money ran out?
Start of etika/twomad type arc
Matthew 6:24 “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.
bro realized he made the biggest mistake of his life & luckily it wasn’t too late
This got got bigger🙏
tag when me when youre REALLY back 😂
Bro was low on money and sold out again bro dropped religion and made a deal with the devil
Bro i Respekt the was he changed but I miss the old jidion
Bro Jidion got a lil plump since the last time i seen him👀
Jidon
Bro once saved, always saved
Jidion is now shidion
You lost all you moment on the algorithm.. you deleted all your content … your not gonna make any money from this YouTube thing unless you super grind … the thing is you could of been religious and not deleted your entire career.. you have been brainwashed but a church cult 🤷‍♂️ … I bet they also have had you donate a huge percentage of your saving and upcoming income ..
LETS GOOOO JIIIIID We missed you man! Glad to see you back, love the new content coming up
Jidion why don't you prank satan
I lowkey miss the troll content..
He's back to making the devil's money
As a brother in Christ you gonna have to just get off your ass. God delivered me from the trap I was going to cali having a good time and  plenty of easy money but now I work a 9-5. I make prolly less than 10 percent what I used to. I went from having abundant spending money to now barely scraping by and sometimes the account empty. My relationship with Christ is more important. If YouTube don’t pay you bruh you just gonna have to do what you don’t wanna do. I know how it feels.
The vibe just doesn't feel the same...
You could still prank without sinning
So happy your back and doing vids that aren’t just about faith because I believe that Jesus truly thinks that as long as your not hurting anyone then what ever you do with your life is fine and he wants us to have fun while still respecting others
i have to ask what you mean sinful stuf i dont think some of these pranks were sinful yo
bla no thanks. trying to come back for the money so lame. you telling us GOD can not pay them bills haha
i love you man😍
Not funny anymore. Joining that cult sucked the personality out him. Seems phony now.
deleted all your videos but forgot rent aint free smh
Nah I love Jid but this not hitting, not gonna lie 😭
Pranking is not bad ..you were doing God's work by making people happy spreading happiness..if pranks were bad why would God enable a laughing mechanism in people .laughter relieves stress.entertaining is your talent..or go make some Hollywood movies king
praise allah
do what you love not what you believe
Man what religion are you with you got The menorah in the background
I know that money is going low
You been eating good man….
Yesssirrr
He basically started posting again because he needs money 😭
I like this jidion more way to go man ❤
main prolly got demonitized😂
So much for keeping your promise to God
W
Glad u found the middle ground😊
God loves u
you can always do what you still love! You can always preach your words to others in good faith and having a audience and still being the same.
Hell NO NO NO. You blew it you blew it.
🤡
I really recommend making Pranks Like Ross Creations. He does it in a way where its more surprised rather than angry of a reaction
I miss you man
Na jid we need the pranks
buddy gotta pay his billsss
WE ARE SO BACK
Damn got me with the pranks :(
Bro got huge
We already knew youd come back.
Damm I really fucked wit you but your not him anymore
Good to see ya black!
no pranks.
Guess god ain’t gonna make you money don’t worry bruh you can always come back to the dark side we welcome you with open arms 🤗
nah this aint jidion, bro got fat and isnt funny anymore
Man’s couldn’t really be with God 24/7 fr  he needed the bag
Satan won’t give up on ya he got you deceived again you’re almost back into sinning full time again
I remember commenting on his original video, saying when that money running  out, we’ll see if God really saves you …and he will come back to making pranks again we see God didn’t save you  son😂😂😂😂😂😂
I haven't watched the video yet but i really want you to bring your prank videos again
Cringe
Do some harmless pranks Plwaze 😭😭😭
I'm kind of disappointed ngl, I believe u discussed this with josh but man just by the title makes me think that this is wrong you know exactly what u did there.
Bro, you can literally do anything because your videos aren't carried by the actual content that you do. Rather it's your personality that carries it. You could do so much like become a speaker, do charity streams, go up to random people, ask them about their mental health, etc. I bet you could do stand-up comedy too. You still have options
Preach The Good.
Do your Jesus thing and do your old content. Jesus don't care.
I subscribed to your godly page fam! Thanks for the Madden game today on Kick! Salute king! Praise God!
This is so down bad bruh dude sucks now fell off so hard and made shit decisions
blud realized god aint gonna pay em bills
Finna unsubscribe from this channel and the main Jid needs to do pranks again
coming back for money and attention. glad you changed for the better 👍
Can't server God and money huh.. Bible is never wrong
Hypocrite
Bro realised rent won’t pay itself 💀
Who cares
Jidion & EDP in same video? This MIGHT be the comeback
1 last prank vid for the one time one time we need Demarcus cousins III Again
Jidion back lets go i missed you so much dawg. I was so sad when you deleted all your videos. Glad to see you back ❤❤
Right as depression was at its peak, the cure just pops right up
Blud got rent due
I’m so glad you back
Jidion was finding himself !pranking and video games are not evil how u conduct ur self and the content of it is what makes it evil. Being mean to people is what makes it evil . Not the act of it self . Glad to see you back ❤🎉
Nah Coming back for the money is crazy.   Matthew 6:24, you can’t serve two masters. Entertainment is for fun, and for resting but not a full time thing.   you can still find your true purpose that god has for you in life while doing YouTube. It’s not like YouTube has to be the MAIN thing. You can still find your talents and passions outside of entertainment, like who knows what talent may have given you that you don’t know of   it could be a dream job that you end up becoming passionate about, that you never knew you always wanted, or maybe something big.  you just gotta ask God and look for what it is. But in the end of the day.   Entertainment and God’s plan are two separate things. One is for rest and one is for progression.
Religious channel failed, bro?
im genuinly happy for you id really like to see some more content from you
You know Jidion you could always do wholesome and harmless pranks. Fun and silly stuff that could leave people confused, astonished, or maybe even feeling better! There’s a lot of things people are afraid to do that might actually make someone laugh and feel better and you could do it! With all that charisma and confidence you got you could definitely make content out of it ❤ much love
KING IS BACK
Shut up
Ngl jidon u been eating looking goood :)
No pranks, damnn that’s how you’ve come this far, oh well sad dayssss
As a Christian I think this is great. I love Christian content but as someone made aware of the state of the world by the Holy Spirit, you need a good break from the madness. And a yt video is a good way to relax I'm hype for the let's play cuz I judge games from a Christian perspective
I was so happy when ur said he was pranking again then I was depressed again
FUNNY MONEY
i used to look up to you gang
JiDion is a terrible person
The government paid you to do what
His rent must be due
Hypocrite
i promise he’s not christian and he did that to get back into nba games. he always talked about how he regretted that
You realized you went from millions of subscribers to a fraction of that. You thought your followers would join you on your path. Some did, majority didn’t. That’s what got you. And then you came back.   You coming back is no problem. You probably missed the fame but who would blame you.
Since most of yall are kids. Realize when someone (which eventually can be your one day) go through stages in faiths. The honeymoon phase is what he was in, now he’s out of it and he will be a more balanced person. This time he’s going to create content that everyone can enjoy and he can feel good about.
W
Glad your back but kinda a himpicrit
Bro need money
god bless this man amen you are an example to every young preson. You are an example for me and you really help because when i watch your videos i feel the need to give into sin less
Theres a mix of comments in this comment section
Faker
This is really weird seeing you as one of the internets biggest pranksters to being idk a Christian YouTube channel is crazy but all love!
ngl the pranks made u
Reactions and gameplay? Yeah we in there. Appreciate what you do, man.
yea man, I don't really understand the whole "quitting YouTube to follow god" thing. As a no-religious person, if he wanted to change his lifestyle, id 100% support a change in content format. I'd even argue that his videos had a positive impact on some people. At the end of the day, you want to appeal to the largest audience possible.  If you can get your original fanbase to tune in, while bringing together more new members, that is great.
surprise2😒
jj
Bro ran outta money left for clout came back for clout💀
I need to take a break from games i aint even know jidion quit
i really missed my boy matt from wii sports
Bible Debate?
Love your content, wish you all tge best for your spiritual journey with christ. All the best may God be with you
Been Following you since 2021 met you at Minute Maid park was sitting right in front of you keep doing your thing man❤
Welcome to Islam bro
Do you have a girlfriend?
I did used to like you. And listen I completely respect you turning to Christ, im a christian myself. However this feels more like a cash grab rather than wanting to entertain the viewers, and missing posting things like this. You left, and made that decision and, now your trying to wiggle your way back in because you've realised the cash has stopped flowing in. And as ive said, turning to Christ is great man, but its likely you'll flop now. People loved the old Jidion, the guy who trolled, messed around, and made jokes. The gay shit was weird, fine. But the rest wasn't really bad. I don't think you should've deleted all of your content, I think you should've just improved maybe switched it up a bit. But its clear you've had a change of heart. And its clear its nt because you miss it. You'll probably never get the same amount of hype and attention you got before, I believe if you kept making the same videos just no gay shit you would've kept growing, but I doubt it now.
NAH BRUH THIS A CLONE!
This Jidion seems weird.
Money running low he had to bounce back
i think we all kinda expected this to happen, at one point or another
HES BACK
what's with the devil horns hand sign at the beginning bruh
😂😂😂😂 0:33
That Holy Ghost ain't work out for you huh? L 🤦‍♂️
People saying “I kNeW hE wAs cOmInG”🤓. Dawg hes coming back to just play video games hes not doing that goofy prank stuff no more
Lets gooooo
Jidion is too much of an entertainer he gonna come back to the pranks but it will take a while
I really loved your old content, and I think you’re a great person. I personally just don’t watch reaction videos and gaming too much, wish the best for you Jid fr
Buddy realized that bullshit don’t pay lmao, power of Christ compels you to make money
Bro continue to do what makes you happy!!   We here regardless!!!
Rent Due huh
So whats his main channels most active thing i found is a clips channel think someone else runs it tho
They cloned em 😢
Bu- but what if you do Christian pranks?!?
once u corny u on the cob forever
whats happening with the biggest menace series now?
finally
Light bill needs to be paid💀
No telling how many people you will lead to Christ! The sky is the limit and you have motivated me to not be ashamed to talk about my faith!
Dam no more pranks 😭
Pockets started running thin?
That was a real nice prank saying youll come back to pranking
no way 💀
PALWORLD LETS PLAY IS A MUST!
Jid we love u but what’s so bad abt pranks like it does more good than bad 😭
Jidion will you still be a Christian??
Love you Jidion, when you walk the narrow path to serve Christ, that doesn’t mean you should live your life stiff and strict, Jesus himself would still love for you to have fun and actually be yourself without being ignorant. Much love brother ❤
i was here for the pranks :(
Praise Jesus
i still think you should do prank videos just a little more mature if you know what im saying
Wow so straight after he denounced his former lifestyle and deleted all his videos his first video back he throws up the baphomet sign right at the beginning of the video and then has his computer/game chair conveniently covering up one eye of the painting behind him smh…🤔
I agree.
Lol knew this was some type of prank
miss u jid💪🏼💪🏼
I’m ngl jidion ruined his career with this break I don’t think he’ll ever reach the peak he was at before
W
so he only came back for money
Just make videos where you have fun in public.
Money wasn’t as good. THATS why he came back 😂
CONGRATS ON THE NEW HOUSE!
Went back 2 da world ig
welcome back
we wanna see you play games PLEAseeee
mans did a christianity stunt for clout
God bless thee always brother Jidion. And keep on proclaiming The Truthful, Redeeming, and Life-Giving Gospel of the Holy Trinity.
Cool
Welcome back ❤
this title is NOT of christ let's be honest brother
imma just be honest u used to be my absolute favorite but now i just feel like everything is fake idk, also my own opinion
Please bring back the old videos please just for memories.
Put the old videos back up
Finally
Plz come back 😭😭😭😭
That boy thick!
Yo jideon i got a really big question are you still going to release your catching edp video where you caught him again for doing the stuff he does best (you know what i mean ) as like a final video of your prank era or is that never going to see the light of day
The biggest menace is back
Jidion ima give you some advice bro you can keep making videos and be a Christian I myself am a big time Christian who spreads  Gods word again and again but you need to stop talking about works salvation because that is not What our Lord has taught ever in the old testament and new testament we are saved by grace and faith alone bless you and everyone reading this , for we are in tough times ✝️
JIDIONNNN YESSSSS
Would love to see u do some more wholesome pranks or something like still troll but make it maybe a bit more Christlike
I LOVE YOU
should do some moist critical shit. reaction and ur thoughts on said situation and also tier lists too u nvr know
cupcake mans gonna eat you I'm scared for u bro
CHRIST WASNT GONNA PAY THEM BILLS. CUZ HE AINT REAL PLAYAAAA
You get bodied in every religious debate. When are you going to realize Jesus isn’t God, only God is God. Stop spreading blasphemy
Yo JIdion you should do a lets [lay of the last of us
you should react to history
This Jidion Tether..
Gross.
Just know there’s a lot of content that you can do that’s not sexual you can keep it family friendly
Don't relapse, you were doing so good
Bros  relapsing.
Good too see you back Jidion!
The day you can retire is when you put edp behind bars
lukewarm, ladies and gentlemen. this is what we call lukewarm. his heart is still in the world. you can't have one foot in heaven and one foot in the world. I'll pray for him
that hand sign at 0:04 is all you need to know about this false christian. smh
Nothing wrong with making fun content thats a job as well.
Ya boy getting thiccc
The praks 😢
He went to go find god and he came back to share, and I’ll discard that money comment.
He’s back let’s go W😭😄👍
You still deleted all your bangers
W brother Jidion
Amidst all of my favorite youtubers leaving/retiring, Jid is back and it brings a smile to my face knowing someone who is just enjoying life as a follower of God. I thank you Jid and I hope the future brings you nothing but blessings
Blud needs to go on cut
I never knew that you was going to do this and great video man😊
Wow🎉😊
Yeahhhhhhhh, i missed you man i always wanted you to make other content the pranks were funny as hell but a bit too much sometimes. Love to see more man!
300 pount cup cake man fr
Just a suggestion bro bring your camera a bit lower. You’ve got a ton of headspace. Could make the shot look better
Bullshit, your are fake you missed the YouTube money.
Jidion turning into a big body
bring back backyard boxing!!!!
@JIDSBURNER YOU COULD HAVE THE PRANKS! THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM. IF ANYTHING, YOU COULD TONE THEM DOWN A LITTLE!
I'm glad to see you beck jdion all love god bless you ✝️☦️❤️❤️
Missed u💯
L
yo what you ogn do for april fools?
I can’t wait for u to come back and post am gonna be watching every single one
You are soo fucking fake.... "I miss you guys" = "I miss the YouTube revenue"... You were not missed...
Nah this shits not cause you miss fans
Damn... God was everything until you saw that bank account start emptyting.
Is he just gonna react to others pranks now?
so can u unprivate the videos anytime soon
LOOK WHOS BACK 🎉
Good to see you back to your older roots god bless you. But hey surely you unlisted your older vids and not deleted cuz it be great to see em again.
he doesn’t miss y’all he misses the money
i love jidion and i see his christian videos sometimes but bro contradicted himself hard asf, we all know the money speaks louder, even to bro whos already rich, he probably was giving money to all his family and now he would just make money for him and it would be a normal income with the other channel
you thought God would satisfy your attention thirst lol!
Bro I got the perfect idea for you. I think you’ll be great at going out into the world and street preaching. Might sound crazy but you can use that same courage to do pranks to run up in peoples face and asks them fought questions about Jesus and win souls. You can do it in an entertaining way too I’m sure it’ll be full of confrontation and the people will watch!! I hope God allows you to find this message.
Bro no one thought you were leaving for good 😂 soon you’ll be back to pranking bru
Just do what Cory kenshin does spread the word thru every video . Just don’t go on hiatus every few months
no BOZO xd
Lesssgoooo!!!
Not tryna be mean but this cheesy as hell but nice to see he back
We love you too Jid, stay up stay blessed 🙏✝️
Absolute drama queen and clown. Didn’t have to do this much lol
He censored me for asking questions about jesus.  He lost me when he cant defend his faith and just created an echo chamber to God
I was so sad when he deleted all his vids hope they come back with the comeback he is planning hope they not gone forever 😊
L
I love how he's like I got to make that funny money you know what I mean that funny money
Yo jids ngl I will miss the pranks but if Jesus says no you can't say no but anyway good to see you back love and I hope you have a good time making these videos for us because we definitely will 😂
Everyone knew you was coming back you always will be a troll and a joke
LETS GOO DEMARCUS COUSINS IS BACK
0:50 i wasnt showing love
All this of this is cringe. All this for some relgion b.s, if you have to throw away your whole way of life for some made up being in the sky, that's kind of pathetic
Thank god I missed u
Yeah idk if i can support Jidion anymore after turning his back on all of us, as if we were all bad people just because we were not extremist.. I am a Christian, i believe in Jesus. But Jidion was basically implying that everyone who isn't an extremist (like he was) was a bad person and that there was something wrong with being a regular person. And then 'content-izing' the Christian Religion as if this is all just one big joke. Completely disrespectful to not only his fans, but the Christian religion as a whole. I get spreading the word of Christ is a good thing, but youtube-izing our beliefs for his wallets benefit is completely wrong and i can't support him after that!  And NOW LOOK, he's now turning his back AGAIN. For EVEN MORE SELFISH REASONS. SMH. Shame on you Jidion. You tried to make us all feel terrible about being normal and now look, you're back to being a regular person again because why? MONEY. SHAME ON YOU JIDION.  You could have spread the word of God at the end of all your videos and it would have reached way more people. But now look, you're turning your back on turning your back. FOR SELFISH REASONS. Going back on your word after trying to make us all feel bad as if we weren't doing enough, as if we were all millionaires who could just quit our jobs and live however we wanted to. AND NOW LOOK. YOUR SELFISH HANDS ARE TURNING BACK TO THE PERSON YOU WERE BEFORE.   SHAME ON YOU JIDION.
Alternate Reality
Go back into retirement and start going to the gym then come back
One of the happiest days of my life
Literally what thanos said
Jideon this community love you very much, I'm glad to see you back, in a more tamed way  🤣🤣.  Thank for entertaining us through all theses years, and now deciding to entertain us, the righteous way. 💖💖
Can u re-upload the prank videos 🙏
Oh so now it’s ok to make gay jokes, and having a lot of money is fine?  The hypocrisy is insane
what a flog 😂
Bro has bills due next month
YALL SHOULD LEAVE JIDION ALONE...HE KNOWS WHAT HIS DOING AND ITS THE RIGHT THINGS HE HAS DONE?
You had one job and that was to get Mr Cupcake Man in jail and what happened? You FAILED!! You made a fool out of everyone and yourself I’ve lost all respect for you and I have no sympathy for you. I understand you want to turn your life around to Jesus Christ and I love Jesus myself… but not like this. You’ve lost a subscriber. Have a nice life
just stop bro
glad to see you came back in some form, miss you man you were my favorite entertainer but i understand that pranks go against the path you've chosen to follow. Cant wait to see what you get up to and play/react to though.
We just glad you back gang ❤
Well well well looky looky what we got here
YESSSSSS, HE COMING BACK
To see you fold this quickly is frankly hilarious. I remember talking with people and saying that a person who makes a switch that drastic likely won’t last long. Low and behold lmao  I’m not here to hate or anything and I think it’s nice you’re still getting support but man I can’t help but laugh bro 😂😂
Let's be a 100% honest here. You didn't miss none of your fans, you missed getting some money that's all you missed. You made a huge mistake deleting all your content that still brought you in your views and you realized all of your new content doesn't bring you anything. So you decided to crawl back to us and act like you care about what we think, you don't.
Still a L
FouseyTube part 2. Sad to see... 😔
Not the prank era
What I think is the most hilarious part about the end of JiDions prank era is that it canonically was when conforting EDP in a cupcake outfit
The reactions were the only reason I wached you, glad to see you back!
Yo you just pranked me
Welcome back goat, it’s been too long
petition for jidion to start giving to strangers instead of trolling them like he used to!  👇
I’ve been waiting for this day 🔥🔥
The Bible itself acknowledges distortion  In Psalm 56 of the Book of Psalms, it was mentioned by a closer tongue, why do people insult me?! All day they burn my words for all their evil thoughts 113  And in the headquarters of Isaiah, and it was mentioned on the tongue of Isaiah, the headquarters of the Children of Israel, saying to them, “Oh, for your distortion!  And in the book of Jeremiah, it came from the tongue of the Lord, addressing the children of Israel: When the Lord revealed, do not despise it too far, because the word of every human being is his revelation, since the words of the faithful God, the Lord of the skins, our God, have surrounded you.  And in it also it was stated on the tongue of the Lord, how do you say we are wise and the law of the Lord is prepared 12 that the pen is the writing the writer turned it into books .. and his saying speak the writing shows that the distortion is in the house and not only in the first hand as some scholars of the People of the Book claim. C ------------ At the Council of Nicaea (325 AD), Christ was officially deified. And God became composed of the Father and the Son only  In the Council of Constantinople (381 AD), the Holy Spirit was deified to complete the Trinity. And it stipulated that the Holy Spirit emanates from the Father only, and at the Council of Toledo (589) there was a correction of the error and it stipulated that the Holy Spirit emanates from the Father and the Son together.  French philosopher Voltaire: I have two hundred volumes of Christian theology and I read them all, as if I were touring a mental hospital. --------------- The Bible sometimes denies the pagan doctrine of the Trinity  confirm it!! We find in (John (8/41) that Christ said, “We have one Father, and he is God.”) While it came in (1 John (5/7)): Those who testify in heaven are three: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one. ! --------- Throughout history... The Church and the Vatican have made many concessions in favor of the Jews and to please them. Rather, she made many changes in her faith!!⛪🤔🤔🤔😔😔 ... It came in the Gospel of John [17:3] that Christ, peace be upon him, turned his gaze towards heaven, saying to God: ((And this eternal life is that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you sent.))  What came in the Gospel of Luke: 34:41] from the words of Christ: ((It is necessary for me to preach the good tidings of the kingdom of God to other cities, because for this I was sent  It came in the Gospel of Luke [7: 16] that Christ, after resurrecting the dead, who is the only son of a widowed woman, it happened that all the people present glorified God, saying: ((A great prophet has risen among us. And God visited His people, and this news spread in the region of Judea and in all the neighboring regions .))  It was mentioned in the Gospel of Luke [24: 19]: that two of Christ’s disciples described him as a prophecy while he spoke to them and he did not deny them this description, so they used to say: ((Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet powerful in deed and word before God and all the people. ((  It was mentioned in the Gospel of John [9:17] what the blind man said: ((They also said to the blind man, what do you say about him in that he opened your eyes and said that he is a prophet)) “Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with powers and wonders. And signs that God did with his own hand in your midst, as you also know.” (Acts 2:22)  It was mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew | 10.11:21: ((This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee))  It was mentioned in the Gospel of John [6:14] that the people who saw the miracle of multiplying food that Christ made, and believed in it, said: ((Indeed, this is the prophet who is coming into the world))  And in the Gospel of Luke [13:33] Christ speaks while introducing himself, saying: ((It is not possible for a prophet to perish outside Jerusalem))  In the Gospel of Matthew, in the fifth chapter, Jesus said: Do not think that I have come to fulfill the law or the prophets. I did not come for a thousand but to fulfill it.  It came in the Gospel of Matthew [64] that Satan, after taking Christ to the Holy City and stopping him on the edge of the roof of the Temple, said to him: ((If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, because it was written: He will command His angels about you, and they will carry you on their hands so that you will not stumble upon your feet. drag! ))  John wrote in [20:17] that Christ said to Mary Magdalene: ((Tell them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God))  The Gospel of Matthew [10/40] that Christ said to his disciples: ((Who  He who accepts you accepts me, and he who accepts me accepts Him who sent me.”

Money’s running out huh

Bro we never stop loving you for who you are you have fans all the way in the Bahamas you really need to link up with Ryan Trahan or take a page out of his book cause he is a full-time Christian and still makes amazing videos that are funny an entertaining ❤
Just be careful 🧐 a little Leaven leaveneth the whole lump
jidion 😭😭😭😭😭❤️
we have him back thanks to uncle sam
Bro misses the money that's all it is
idc wheres the edp video
Crazy seeing people possessed and brain washed by religion...
You put christ first and and let go of many things. Now you are back closer to him. this is good
Next coryxkenshin
hope your acount stays dead   you reverted in so many ways in a 3 minute video the point of the video was to say you need money and you said you wanna leave bc your doing this devil stuff for money and then you use a gay title for money after saying no more gay jokes and that’s my brand
told y’all he just wanted to retire and live a rich man’s life and he had a great excuse and now that the money isn’t  kicking in he completely reverted he even said no more gay jokes that was his big thing prob top 3 things he mentioned and what’s the title and how many where in this 3 minute video lol y’all fall for anything
Bro realized god doesn’t pay the bills ☠️
I knew it, Jid you got the shakiest doctrine my man become orthodox
that money looking funny lol
imma summarize it before even watching it,u need money
RESUBBED. W
It's sad how religion can scare someone and stop them from making jokes. You shouldn't let it control you. Religion is about peace and people coming together. You shouldn't be scared. You should use religion to be happy. You can make pranks and help people. Reading the bible on  stream doesn't help anyone. I know you say it's you're decision but you were scared into it. That's just how people work. So don't be scared to do what you like if it isn't hurting anyone.
i missed you dude ❤️
Money run out already?
rev 3:16
bro remember us becuz $ went low, but honestly I fukn missed this guys content on god like I was rewatching his old reaction vidz. bro welcome back...
bro look a little chubby
The legend has returned. Can’t wait to watch you again jid.
Just don’t man don’t
Jid seems so much happier, excited for his return.
Missed ya🥹
When he said we might even go back to the pranks i got so happy and was smiling and then he said it was a joke and i punched my monitor, i thought the king was back for a second🥲
bro pussy for not pranking
Happy to see you back Jid, keep spreading faith. I’ve seen it grow more and more on you each and every video, Glad to see you’re finally consumed in the Lords love. We missed you Jidion
One eye symbolism and horns at 0:04 ain’t fooling me 🤷🏿‍♂️
I no longer enjoy your vids
My boy put on some weight…
I have a suggestion for gaming btw. Play THE FINALS! It's the best fps shooter out rn and I'm %100 sure me and all of your fans would love that
I feel like you're definitely funny enough to run any type of channel, sinful or not. I'm praying that you will succeed in gaming content
-_- so hes.... not back
LETS GOOOOOO
Going to miss the pranks, and most of the jokes, but, ay, gotta be grateful we're getting this side of you back. I support you no matter what, but I love to see you just have fun, and such, Love You Jidion!
What games are you planning on playing?
With the Turbo Tax sponsor😭😭😭
We missed you jid ❤🫡
get yo ass back in walmart dawg
Do respectful pranks where you just confuse people and don’t harm them and get a laugh from everyone
Finna start watching u again now fuck finally
🌽 🏀
I dont get what pranking has to do with being religious. Just dont do whatever you feel is bad. like there is such a thing as pranking friends and stuff. You dont need to piss of strangers. Just cuz you joke doesn't mean your a sinner bro dang.
Nah, you’re still a sellout, even more that you’re coming back for the money. Foh with that I miss you stuff. Yeah all the simps will be back to support you, but not the real ones. Narcissistic much???   “ This is all behavior not fitting of a Christian”… a month and a half later… ummm I think I’ve redefined what a Christian is to me😂😂😂.
Please do vlogging with your cameraman. Like the prank videos minus the pranking
bros a bigbody what happened
Jidion making jidion videos. I don’t expect menacing pranks but rather simple life vloggjng with his camera man, reactions, game play and some hilarious, hyper jidion jokes (toned down jokes that aren’t dirty)
are you gonna be able to play GTA 6 ? idk if ur religion is against that
No pranks? Ok bye
Bros bank account was running dry, that so called journey lasted real long bro
play lethal company pls
Just be careful don’t let the world drag you back in
1:49😂😂
Money was dryin up
This title is CRAZY😭
Yo are you going to reUploaded your vidz
W man's bro
This video is mad suspicious.  As soon as u get on camera you throw up the devil horns 🤘 and you got a photo behind you with 1 eye showing . Freemasonry symbols and demonic gesture . Don't trust this dude at all
Your a fraud
Why did u have to delete all the old videos
Make it Christian friendly!
TY JID ILYSM
Nothing wrong with making content as a Christian brooo. IVE BEEN SAYING THIS. Look at coryxkenshin who is a Christian who makes content. WELCOME BACK BROTHER🎉
Do pranks again fuck with people. It’s funny
title literally a sexual joke lmao..... he aint no man of god he a man of that green
real comeback with sus things idc
Jidion is what idubbz should have done
You cannot have two masters man rewatch your own video about gaining the world but loosing your soul.
Good for him🫡
Feels like I have been lie too
Love you gid
MY DUDE RETURNS 🙌 💪
This is what everyone was telling you to do in the first place. Just becasue you believe in God, doesn't mean you have to quit EVERYTHING you do, even he thinks thats stupid. Do you think all Christians quit what they do to praise God? As long as you put him first you're good. Now it will look like you are only back for the money and you're running out of it. If you were to listen the first time, it wouldn't have to be like this. I still support you but this is what everyone was saying from the beginning.
No more pranks but I still miss the irl content. Maybe some like wholesome vlogs with the boys like you did with pokimane pls 🥺
Bro lasted 6 weeks lmao. Welcome back square
We're Back
pathetic
Get to 10 million on main channel
Bro realized praying don't pay the bills 😂
the borderline is.. JID IS BACK with more clean content.. missed u so much man..
Using God for marketing is crazy...
The bank got low lol
The goat is back 😎🐐🖤
this is all bs playing with the lords name is not okay and is insanely deceptive making us believe one thing that has everything too do with turning your life over too Christ yet it was just a lie too get more followers truly this is the work of the devil period always will be there’s no excuse for any of the content anymore
Are you still gonna colab with creators like Niko? For example like one of their guess who's the "whatever" videos?
You’re mods are snowflakes jidion
Wow holy crap damn zoo wee mama
Man I’m glad you went to god I got baptized back in December I love to holy content
bro since that god shit you gained alot of fat
jidion you are funny. god isnt real i hate it when cool people like you do waste your life
Yea bro u js solidified yourself as a fraud 😂
Jid how u see YouTube chat while streaming I only have 1 monitor and use obs?
Ngl, idk what to feel about this...
dyde got big
Don’t fall for it brother. Stay strong in Christ. Don’t let the world pull you back in it, that’s how we slide back into Sin. We live in a Fallen World and Jesus is coming back soon, stay in the word. Put your faith in Jesus completely and he will take care of you. Don’t let money pull you back into what you were doing. What is it to gain the world but to lose your soul?
👀
My glorious king jidion ‼️
I’m just waiting for the edp video
Why did you delete your treasure videos! That made me cry
Also keep catching EDP's, thats not a sin.
You can still be religious and entertain people. I'm not religious but pretty it says nothing about playing video games.
glad to see u back man
You seem like one of the really happy dads. Idk why you give off that vibe.
I never found this video funny it’s cringe
Amin
This is some grade A phoney shit tbh
EDP video??
I thought he was gunna prank again
I thought he coming out as Women
i mean hey you could always prank like ross creations where its not too chaotic. Hell even collab with them. But either way your decision does matter and im glad youre back<3
Fakest Christian yet
Jideon vs edp boxing match would be legendary
Bro been making sure he been feed.
I remember when he said to people who didn’t wanna follow his religious videos that he doesn’t want us to follow anymore and now he’s back saying he’s missed his followers?
love u too jid❤l
common Christian L
MAKE PRANKS AGAIN
W
calling EDP 300lbs is generous jid 😂😂😂
HAAHAH you pranked me!!!!!!!! Haahhahaha
You miss the guys that hated on you for being religious? Why didnt you make reaction videos of the news that’s happening around the world that the media is hiding instead of reacting to the sinful things you did yourself before Christianity 😕
no bro leave if da god stuff isn gettin u enuff monie jus get a job
you could of just said this was all a prank and a good portion of your fanbase would believe you
Money ran out?
Gotta pay off that house somehow 😂 welcome back, but doing it only for money is not a good idea
Bro thinks we believe him this is AI😂😂😂😂💀💀💀🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Sad too see the pranks go but I respect it. God Bless!!!!!!!!!
Bro realized he wasn’t making money, me personally it’s never gonna be the same.
Welcome back
Bro got nerfed 🌚
Bros rent was due
If I’m sad it see a new video of jid doing a prank and i start crying with happiness
That was my life
Please do prankkkkksss
hey man never give up?!
Keep up the great work homie frfr. Proud of you 👏
Yah. How did I know this was going happen. When money runs out you go back to your old ways. It’s all about money.
jidds looking like a bouncer these days
this wack asf 😭😭😭
Title almost made me unsub😂
Making queen guards laugh 2??
less gooo im excited!
Let me get this straight... the only reason you're back is because it benefits you. But you didn't give a fuck about your fans when you decide to delete all your content and move with god. Which is absolutely fine but pretty messed up. Practice what you preach. Only back for the bread? Kinda messed up.
I respect you keeping it real about uncle sam lol. Welcome back Jid
👏👏👏
should change his name from JiDion to JiDiot
I’m glad he fixed himself. Everyone said you can follow Christ and still have fun doing what you love 🤣 happy to see it
I like the Christian channel but a reaction vids or one more vid with the captain would be nice 😂💯
U getting a lil chubby man, get in the gym, take care of ur mind and body
He really got me with the prank vids.
thought u were good on money for ages 💀💀💀how tf u need more money
True spreader of faith✝️ Keep making this content man💪❤️
ain't NO WAY bruh you know what mfers called it he was not all about that shit fr 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  but naw welcome back g I do not agree with that stuff you saying about your varient of god but anyway
You missed that money huh? Lmao weak
I mean I knew you were gonna do It because it's hard to stay true to religion today but it's whatever you know. Just know jesus forgives you bro, although tbh i don't believe you did anything wrong thus far.
i miss youu jiddd
Your a cornball
Imagine this is the biggest prank he’s done yet 💀💀
It somehow hurts to see the channel go down, miss seeing you fr man. Proud to see you’re following your heart though. Much love JiDion
You are obviously Dead by now.... There is nothing you could do to revive it ... And that's a fact
Jid IRL on Kick would be sick. You know they’d have a deal waiting for you bro 💰
BIG LOVE JIDION. ❣❣❣. YOUR BACKKKKK
Just like george foreman
im sorry but its not a real comeback without the pranks. THINGSWILLNEVERBETHESAMEAGAIN
We knew it
don’t do this bro you were doing great don’t return back down this path
Widion back at it again
Why don't you do good "pranks" like giving back to the community or helping someone out as humble as you can? I think it would be a good turn from what you did in the past
“Coming out” ? dude 🤦🏽‍♂️ what happen to being done with sexual especially homosexual innuendo ? Or what happen to if you follow Jesus, the world hates you and if you’re pleasing the world, they love you ? The world is literally all welcoming you back and talking about how “they expected this”. This is Jesus “the created being” activity 🤦🏽‍♂️💯 maybe possibly pray over this some more ?
ur black
Glad to see you again bro, you can be a Christian and still do what you love, ❤️
Finally you came to this realization!
What a profiteer
nah nga u just want the money
Least suprising moment ever💀
Jidions profile pic looks like edp445
Coryxkenshin moment
You’re a natural entertainer you can do street preaching that’s really good
bro ran out of money
Your a 🤡  goofy
Bruh, money does crazy things
You a joke!
crazy with the coming out title really contradicting, I supported him with the Christian content and coming back to making content but the coming out title is a bit weird
Some phony vibes tbh
I can see you’re now taking the coryxkenshin career route. Ngl I love it, can’t wait for your content on here
Assssss just stay retired
welcome back jid. the king is back.  we missed you too.
Jid got fattttt
Its youtuber 101 to  1. Make a apologist video 2. Talk about leaving YouTube.  3. Leave YouTube. 4. Come back to YouTube.
He’s finally back
Lmao you guys cry when he leaves and now ur complaining that he’s back☠️ cory plays games and does reactions and he’s a man of Christ “he came back fro the money”he has a networkth of over 3M dollars unless he blew it all on the house it really doesn’t anyways 💀 pls stop this stupid shit bro 90% of ur favourite YouTubers do it for money lmao so?
so bro said all this bullshit about what he cant do but when it comes to money its okay, got it. oh wait weve known.
Bro found out Jesus couldn’t give him money 😭
By the way the fans in your comments are great, positive and so encouraging! You have amazing fans! I think I'm going to like it here 😁💕
Good for you hon, welcome back! Yup, pranks are extremely unnecessary. And don't worry about that perv that's threatening you, all the people that loves you and the big guy up there got your back. God bless you Pa
0:04 🤟 IYKYK
There's many ways you can entertain as a Christian. For example Don does reactions or use too.
You got me 1:48 😅😅😅
The legend is back
The views weren't enough, the money wasn't enough, gods love wasn't enough, you will never be happy and forever grifting.
Love this guy
I wann see IRL videos
hell nah u better stay off then if you gonna come back strict like disney channels
Hey man its ok. You are a comedian. You shouldnt throw that away.
Get all your videos back bro❤❤🎉
Gonna be great to have that content back
Disappointed
So excited to see you post gaming videos and reactions. Would also love to see you do some more livestreams as well.
I’m so disappointed thats the devil working
The cupcake man caught me off guard 😂
YESSSSS JID I MISSED YOU. Ngl I was worried I wasn’t gonna see you again. And hey I don’t hate on the GiDeon channel, im a man of faith myself, I just didn’t wan to be left without you doing other stuff too just like you described with reactions and gaming and stuff like that. I can’t tell you how happy I am that you’re back man!! Thank you so much you made my whole day
Real ones know that kanel, lofe, niko, and d'aydrian harding got us held down and ain’t playing these type of games with their community 💯
Bro contradicted everything he preached. 💀
We do miss you too, I don’t care if you keep doing religious content but I would say Josh is still a horrible religious influence for you  I just miss you LIKE THIS! It’s been months since we saw Jidion
No pranks?
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
W’s in the chhatttt
Are you still gonna try to catch predators with skeet?
lol his  glasses sideways af
post the deleted menace series
So does this mean the menace is coming out of retirement?
What happened??? I swear it’s only been a month or two and you look like you ate the old Jidion
glad to see you ack
2 months tops before he abandons the religious channel
Broooo literally got me With the last one,,,,,,lul.
Bro looks PHAT now 😂
W
stop focusing on being a Pharisee & a legalist and enjoy your time on here
This dude turned into a bot rip
Fell. Off too hard… didn’t stick to your word…
Dude so dumb had to do it to see that it was a bad idea😂😂😂
Gonna miss this guy...
No to Jidion
Doesn't have the balls to stick to your word. Fell off
IM HAPPY FOR YOU I MISS WE MISS YOU TOO
just don't let the devil take over brotha
We've missed you bro can't wait to see the new content
No
I'm so happy rn
Ik he was gonna come back
Took what? All of 2 months. This guy seems like he’d do anything for clout at this point. I mean obviously lie about doing the right thing. even fake a religion. So untrustworthy when you say one thing and switch up in a month. This guy is obviously here for views and money.
When he said coming out I thought he meant something else for a sec
Ain’t no way we got jidions return before gta 6
Bros money running low gotta go back

Gaming and reactions
I'm happy you back but bro you really pulled a coryxkenshin
yessir! love it 🖤
Broo 😅
only comes back when he needs money🤣🤣 pathetic
We need you back please god appreciates you making are days better !!
I love your entertaining videos bro
Welcome back, Jid. Missed your goofy ass.
Your body is your temple bro, if you're interested I'd love to see a gym journey :) I wonder how many young men you'd inspire.
I’d be fine with you just making reaction and gaming content, and I’d still tune into the religious channel.
just be careful bro 🫡
1:45 greatest jump scare of all time 😭😭
miss you to gng ❤ nice death note music in the back 🔥
You came back because your becoming broke buddy
You know you could use your humor and personality to make videos of you going out and evangelizing the faith to others planting seeds in others hearts on the streets like how Richard Lorenzo and Mario Esparza do.
Fall off is crazy
we need the jidion flightreacts reaction videos on goddddd
JIDION I MISSED YOU
He got us when he said he was gonna do pranks again, that was a really good... Prank🫣
Yeah he fell off
bro go back to pranks if I gotta be honest I ain’t watchin no reaction vids or gamin
Shit, I knew it!!!! I wanted to comment a month ago how I kinda knew Jid was coming back, not this way, I thought it was a huge prank but damn this still is nice, I’m glad ur back Jid saw all ur vids since tik tok I truly love you
1 prank per month😗😗😗
I was thinking that you should do gaming content too.
nahh bro getting the money and gonna dip again
Glad to have you back my guy
Widion
Smh youre like a toxic ex. "I miss you 🥺" be so fr 🤣🤣
What's the point??! Nobody wants to watch you play games and react to videos.
It would be cool to watch you going camping or something just chilling with nature
Come back to pranks pls😭
Pls bring back the original content
Imagine he did that whole religious journey for 4 whole months and stuck to it then was just like “it’s a prank bro, hail satan!” Would’ve been legendary if he acted for that long   But him being with god is cool too
He was getting fanum taxed 😭 we love you jid
😂😂😂🎉🎉
Some games you can play is walking dead from teltale games, red dead redemption 2, or detroit become human trust mee brooo we would love that contenttt . Its amazing story content you can play and chill on. Amazing come back first video
Gonna miss the pranks but happy you're doing well for yourself man.
@JidsBurner You should do a reaction/review of the Prince of Egypt
I was bouta say
jideon did a devil hand
cant wait for the letsplays and reacts. all praises to God
Don’t know about this one chief
Bro's back on the BS.
Jidion I’m happy. For you I love your stuff but please repeat what you preach don’t tell everybody not to do pranks and go do pranks (as an example)
Do a GTA online gameplay
Skibidi toilet 1-70 reaction? Think about it
Go back to old content it’s was fire this new shit ain’t it
lol the lord ain’t paying enough to keep up with your lifestyle so now you realize this is what you could have done originally 🤣
L
Thank u papa Jid for this news .
You left your fans that stuck by your side for so long, deleted everything we cherished about you, completely changed your content to "spread the word of Jesus Christ" (which just means trying to convert people to your religion), and now you came back because you need money? And without the main content you used to do because you deem it heretic? Damn, I lost all the respect for you bro.
WWWW
hypocrite
You getting jacked or eating good
This man has totally lost his mind. I hope he gets the help he needs.
Did anyone actually think he was leaving for good 😂😂
old vids coming back? welcome back jid
Less go
Thought you said you can't be half world and half god, hypocrite
Demarcus Cousins back like he never left 💯🐐
the pranks were the reason i was subscribed
u can never tame a beast. I know jidion is and will come back.
"Life's calling" for money 💀
Bro Jideon DO NOT let this take you to sin. I don’t like where this is going, but if you think you can do both I trust ypu
i loved the reaction videos to jubilee or cut😭 reacting to vids shouldn’t be bad🤷‍♀️
Embarrassing ass moment
Preciate you big dawg
btw I love fantasy, sci-fi, etc and who knows wtf is possible in the universe, but you believing in man made religion is insane...there's a reason religion tried to bury science and free thought back in the day. Think about it, if your glorious religion had it's way we'd still be living in the 1500's. Religious leaders hate science because it threatens their dominance over sheep like you jdion.  FFS, real science religion will be real in 500 or so years where you can stop ageing and live eternally in a dream state in any reality you want. Think about where science can take humanity...the possibilities are endless. Imagine 20,000 years from now if humans don't die out....can you imagine what will be around?  We might evolve into energy beings, learn how to transform ourselves and visit other dimensions, evolve our brains into well...something that's a zillion times smarter that opens the doors to other dimensions, and fuck knows what...  Believing in a man made god is so....juvenile. Come on man.
No pranks? Then how tf you gonna make money because those were carrying your YouTube channel. Your a good YouTuber Jid but you gotta starting doing the pranks again
You should invest your money wisely so you don't have to worry about money issues in the future. Follow Dave Ramsay and he'll tell you about what mutual funds to invest in.
bruh you devoted your life to make believe bullshit. Hopefully you grow out of it but I doubt it since your brain is already formed at evolved to where it will stay. There's hope though.
no words no words
Congrats on finally coming out. Being gay is ok and no one should be ashamed of that. Own your gayness dude. Full support.
We missed you!
W
Let’s go!
George Foreman Type shizzzzz lmao LOVE ❤
Why can't you do pranks? Its not a sin even if you wont go to hell
Meet DeMarcus Cousins again🙏
Pretty sad how he turned back just cus of money 👎 ts was for attention
Bruh moment
JID IS BACK
Lol
don’t come back please
Bro misses the money 😂
Bro dumb af. Single handedly tanked a career that he was incredibly blessed to have and then comes crawling back when the tax man comes 😂  there’s nothing wrong with making more mature content but there’s literally no reasons to ditch the main channel that can give you millions of dollars just because you “used” to make prank videos on it. Like just use your main channel and post videos that you think are “Christian” worthy or whatever the f you need to do now
This made me so happy to know ur back jid❤️❤️ maybe some more lighthearted pranks?? Nothing that can affect someone long term???
Cool to see you back!
Just keep Christ at the center of it
Rent due huh
dam u got hella fat
Can you play lethal company
i love u jid i hope all is good i think that i can speck for all of us u should do daily vlogging we whould love that along with more cupcake man stuff ik that leans more to the pranks but if u can get skeet on it and maybe sit there for peaceful commentery it will rpovdied closur and cocntent with out sin  LOVE U JID hope u see this
Go back to pranking please 🙏
Love you bro
confront lil nas about his heresy
started screaming for joy when he said "going to be doing some pranks"
LETS [expletive censored for Jesus] GOOOOOO
love you bro we missed you hella happy to see your back happy and healthy good to see you back jid❤
Dont lose yourself in the entertainment bro, God bless.
Wait... but you just "Pranked" us in THIS VERY VIDEO!! 😂😂 c'mon man!! You can still prank and be a Christian. Thats a misunderstanding of gods word. Especially if you change the type of pranks you do.
❤
Let’s go
bro needs to pay some bills 🤦‍♂️
Dude saw the money and views drying up and had to come back
you made your money from pranks being religious doesn't mean you can't do pranks you're not gonna be back on😂

Bro ran out of money

He pranked me by saying the pranks are coming back
Bro came back for the money 💰

ngl i thought he was finna actually come out and be one of those internet snowflakes
Finally

Don’t leave us We already have Had MatPat And 2 other YouTubers Leaving us already
I knew his ass was gonna come back 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Jidion bro nice to see you back my man. Love how you are just being yourself and doing what you want to do. Are you going to be back on your main or this burner?   Also i think edp likes you...
Just Keep God First My Bro🙏🏾
Yessss Letttss Goooo😂😂😂😂 the edp part 😂😂❤❤❤
you eating good
Bring back the old intro
LESSS GOOO
down fall of jidion
No pranks :(
0:05 and already throwing up the horns... Guess we know why you're coming back and who you truly serve. May God have mercy on those who trust and are deceived by you. Trust no man, only Jesus Christ.
maybe you could teach the gospel minus the calvinist work salvation stuff, just a thought.
You technically pranked us by telling us you where gonna prank again
The goats back, hopefully you could probably do gaming and reactions or live streams sometimes but by all god bless✝️✝️
❤❤
Kinda sad. Thought you was actually finna devote yourself to God. Do want you want but it's kinda disappointing.
Is that a menorah
Jid we need a collab with vlogcreations bruh they got the best jokes ever! Definitely a necessity for the comeback!
Jid needs to play FNAF for our viewing pleasure.
It was great while it lasted. Wish you the best.
🔥🔥💯
Jideon=Pranks
knew it
Lmaoooooooooo😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bros channel would blow up if these confused kids though you were gay
Lol. Bro couldn't survive on the scriptures solely. You are just a tool. After using religion to gain traction now you've come back and ur immature fanbase would overlook it. Classic youtuber.
Pranks. Jid please. It’s what the people want.
The Return of Jidion 🫡💯🐐
yessir bro he’s back
Koryxkenshin is religious (Christian) and can still make entertaining content in spite of it, never understood your decision to quit but I’m glad you’re back. 😊
not tryna disrespect you, but u can do a gym series it will bang I am sure
Bro got me excited for the pranks 😭😢
So nice that you're representing the Muslim community☪️😢❤❤
We need a Video about the gospel prank❤
Bro realized he needed that $$$$ and Christian content just ain't making the bag
The whole point of us watching YOU is for YOU do whatever you want on your channel and we will continue to support you because no matter what ya do we watch you for YOU
love you man so glad to see you coming back i missed your way of content
Appreciate the honesty lol the IRS really dont play.
1:46 “They Had Us In The First Half Ain’t Gonna Lie”🙌🏻☝️
Not very god like 😳
Glad to have you back!!!!!
Bro we knew you was gon need/want money eventually. YOU CANT RUN
you could do christian pranks, i could totally see that
U really did me dirty with the prank part lmaooo
Sellout
Why don’t you join Mr beast team ? You know build wells and food drives.
daddy jid came back looking fresh
Our Lord and Savior Christ loves you JiDion! ✝️🙏
Dudes only back cuz he got house payment 😂😂
BRING A BIBLE TO SCIENTOLOGY PRANK!!!
man lost the argument to sheikh uttman Lmao
If jideon got a dollar every time he said “genuinely”he’d be able to pay Uncle Sam 😂
What about tameish pranks?
You should do some gaming videos man that would be fire
damn this was actually a tear jerker but at least you’re not quitting so we’re good ❤❤
U really had me excited when u said pranks omfg smh
Jidion if your coming back you should post the videos you have of edp(if that is okay with your pastor and God) because the dude did threaten you, and he is a bad dude.
Idk why but the vibe feels  different in this vid
God first… after taxes lmao
Tf wrong with pranks
🫸🫷🫸🫷
This is exactly what I wanted. Your premium channel was my favorite. Glad to see you back doing it
so much for religion, what a chameleon.
You can still be Christian and do it but just do it
did you pray today
Why not bringing back good hearted pranks? What would be wrong with that?
Please go meet the captain again
Pls man come back! We miss
HES BACKKKK
Nah
we love you jid.
Jidion you looking swole man
Biggest Respect to you for leaving all the wordly temptations for a higher perpose. May Allah guide you to Islam one day. Love and Respect❤
Brother why did you wait until you got rich before you came back to God?
Do whatever u want just bring back the old vids
still there was no reason to delete the old videos.
2024 is already becoming a W year
Miss you gang glad you back
God bless, its not the pranks we miss its you 🥰
Can we get vlogs ❤️
Welcome back jid
Lil bro starting to run out of money 💀💀💀
I said it on your 2nd last video and I'll say it again — I believe you can absolutely serve God while making videos that entertain us. Maybe you never do pranks again, all good, totally understand. But whether it's vlogs without pranks, streaming, or something else — the format matters not. Your humour provides such a positive impact, and that's the kind of thing I believe god smiles upon. Good to have you back for the next chapter, JiDion. 🙏🏻
Love you man🙏
Jidion bruh you came back looking like big chungas.Its 2024 time to workout g body transformation
You looking real good jidion ❤️‍🔥
Bro I thought he was coming out as gay 😭😭😭😭
Why can't a christian prank if its family friendly and all in good fun, god likes to laugh too
Running outta cash, gotta return to the devil side 😂 welcome back bro, sheytan always wins as you see
Jid we've been telling you play games or just chill on reacts bro. I'm a newly converted Christian and I'm figuring out my path as well so it's nice to be inspired by seeing someone of your previous stature lose your life to recieve the new life.
i love you jidion
Jid, I love how how you turned to Christ right and he told you to follow your own stuff and we missed you so welcome backkkkkkk
Some of the best news possible. Excited to see you back.
more sorority streams pls
Bills must be due.
ay atleast bros being honest. Bro needs money like me fr
We miss u Jidion but keep in mind don’t loose sight of the lord man.. I’m glad u back my boi
Miss bro fr
I thought he said he quit youtube
Ur back bro

I missed you man ❤
He’s tryna have a different look on life. Trying to still be a little bit of the old him with having God #1 respect to him
Don’t matter if he ain’t doing pranks. It’s still Jidion

✝️💜
J idiom can’t wait man I missed you so much.
You could maybe play the upcoming Gate Zero, christian game? Could be a cool experience!
we want pranks not ur lame content
u don’t gotta just be a christian robot bro, there’s no problem with doing other things. hope to see u back brother
Miss you to jidion
why no thatwasepic orbigdaws stylepranks?
Cheese
W Jidion
I hope Jidion isn’t gonna have SSSniperwolf type reactions 😢
Widion
bought a new house and forgot mortgage exists
cringe
Jesus died for our sins so that we can go to heaven. He payed our price. Jesus didn’t come into the world to condemn the world but to save the world. Put your trust in Jesus Christ and he will grant you the gift of heaven. 👍🏽
U look like you’d show up to my house to talk about Jesus now instead of robbing me
Let's goooo!!!!!!
This is what i said, we miss the entertainment but no need for the pranks brother! All love ❤
He need more views cuz his religion channel not raking in what he used too, this shi kinda corny fr
What did i say brotha.... bro is literally the biggest menace fr
Good
I just knew he was pulling another So
Cringe
use to respect this dude even when he quit youtube, but now when he realizes God doesnt make him as much money and he likes his thing, now he wants to come back??one of the most backwards things ever. plus the jokes you make dont align with what you preach. for your own sake you needa figure your life out probably in private bc youre crazy hypocritical and you got a lot of young dudes who watch your every move. youre gonna create an army of very confused individuals like yourself
maybe get into a trade lil bro
YESSSSS
I give it at most 3 months before he returns to pranks
WE ALL LOVE YOU JIDION
Lidion
Imma have to carry you in fort one day 😂
…
We missed you
Bro this is exactly want I wanted u too do. Just chill. And stream with the family. God is Great but streaming with ur fans is not haram😂😂. Glad your back bro I love you Jidion. I love U bro.
U fell off.. on god
Hey bud why don’t you do a bunch of stuff and see what works out from vlogging, gaming, podcasts etc and we’ll let you know from likes
I would love to see more pranks but this is still something.we love you jidion
ngl his reaction videos are fire
Do something with Niko again dont need to be pranks yall r just to good of a duo
Ngl yes I didn’t fw Jidon after a while cuz he turned into Kai n just pull the race card for everything but after a while he realized n chilled tf out but frfr u can go back to the same comedy content n do your god channel just don’t go crazy shit god would hate n u won’t be doing shit wrong just cuz u were named menace doesn’t mean u actually are 😂 jack n neon are the Menace to society 😂
You off bruh, keep it packed up 😂
I can’t express how upsetting this is enough. He was so talented at making people smile and laugh and he just stopped because of a fairy tale. Every single one of his points could easily be rebutdtaled he’s just too far up Jesus’s ass he refuses to see
I ain’t watching ur reaction videos if it’s a load of religious talk but good to see u back ether way.
wait what!!!!!!!!!!
Bro gained a few pounds from stopping doing pranks
Letssss goooooooooo🎉
yo Jid! You seem to miss the entertainment portion of creation, why not mix god and pranks? Idk it could be immoral or Unethical but I thought that if anyone could combine those successfully I’d be you. Much love man keep up the hard work!
We need some skeeter Jean and JIDION collabs
Blud scammed us, i actually was sad he left Anyways glad your back demarcus cousins III
Yessss we got you backkk
LETS GO JID❤
Lets gooooo new chapter. People evolve and so does their content. This is an example a lot of creators should set. Make content you like and believe in and it will makes its way to the right people.
Jidion if your reading this you should definitely put Zoouston back in intro and even Boo Thang in the outro but still keep that positive energy ❤❤
Welcome back king of youtube
we knew it was coming
what channel someone pls reply Also jid is listening to music that swears wrong
oh nah
The goat has returned 🎉
happy to see bro back!
yooo I'm so happy your back man the pranks woulda been chill but I respect your reasoning behind it I'm hella excited to see some new bangers tho so keep it up bro
Jidion you were the best Pranker on the World. We need you back. For sure a few pranks were gone too far, but like you can do like Vlogs, doing soft pranks and just beeing funny. We love you for that ( I respect your Opinion to the Pranks and support you, whatever you‘ll do in the future)
AYO LETS GOOOOO
Still gonna miss the pranks😢 but at least ur coming back
There’s nothing inherently sinful about pranks, it just matters what the prank is. If you go out and disturb people yeh that prob a sin, but Ross creations is the perfect example for pranks. His never crosses the line, it’s always funny stuff that harms nobody like eating insulation that’s actually Cotten candy or filling his car with spaghetti-os. I get that your pranks tended to be more harassing than Ross’, but that’s no reason to stop doing pranks altogether if you make them the right way
Why leave if you’re gonna come back, stay gone loser
I never would have guessed
Pastor jidion
It doesn’t have to be pranks, Jid! I always watched your videos for your personality - Never for the pranks themselves.
Gentle hands 🥴
Been saying this, can still do other shit just not that crazy shit lol. Glad u back
Let's go
W
Idm you doing Christian videos and keeping to your faith but don’t mean you should stop creating content like you used to.
It’s sad that you’re not gonna do pranks, but at least you’ll be posting some videos. You need at least some money to survive.
O MY GOD O MY GOD
Lets go
God is great…until I need that money.  Good luck dude.
Can somebody explain to me why pranks are against christ?
they all become live streamers sadly youtube is falling
Jidion. Don’t let god limit you.
glad those pranks are not back but they were entertaining... Welcome back jidion
Brother you have made me turn back to Christ and start my own Christian Insta✝️✝️
Jidion imma beat the shit of you 😢 big fan, do pranks too
We need more content with skeeter
I love the fact jid is coming back for small stuff but not gonna lie it hurts to know jidion is only coming back for money because old jidion only cared about making people laugh
All these big YouTubers quiting glad someone’s back
Bro you’ve been eating 😭
jidion gotta play fortnite
Bro was running low on money
I like how he deleted all his videos except the pranks on jidion shorts which is linked to all his other channels
God bless you Jid!!!!!!!

Them Adsense checks weren’t hitting the same 😂
W Jid. Looks like your brain is back.

Yes brother. Can’t wait to see more funny content from you on top of the GiDion content❤️
YESSIR WOULD LOVE GID GAME

Rip pranks 😭
I wish the pranks were back, but good job man. Keep spreading the faith

Commenting before I watch so he probably addresses this but I’m so freaking happy he’s back like it hasn’t been the same 😭😭 even if it’s just something like gaming or reacting to videos, something where he can still maintain his faith, I would eat that shit up 😭
You would probably be good at Christian street interviews too
LETSSSSS GOOOOOO JID!
It’s great seeing Jidion come back. Not going to lie, most of all the videos I ever watched was just reacts. Pranks are just dying down as a whole. Love to see you praise god while also doing everything you were put on this planet to do.

I LOVE YOU JIDION

WOOOHOOOO
Just do day in a life vlogs
😭coming out got me “WTF HE JUST SAID HE BECAME RELIGIOUS”
The GOAT is back ❤
yo even tho your not doing the pranks i still love seeing your vids love you bruh
I can’t wait for what u got in store, already know the reactions and lets plays r gonna be 🔥glad u deciding to come back and give us sum content
omggg happy for youuu, really wanted the reaction stuff back
I never followed jideon for the pranks so I see this as an absolute win
Unscribed, you used to be a good, now your Terrible plz stop making vids. Or start making your old content again.
Brother JD bout to spread faith whilst flowing the motion 🙏🙏🙏
I told u, nothing matters more than your happiness,  relationships ,  money and faith
welcome back!  🤍
LESSSS GOOOO JIIDDDDDDD ON THING DONT STOP THE OTHER I KNEW YOU’D COME BACK GOD BLESS YOU BROTHER 🙏🏻❤️
Jidion realised he could multitask
Play fnaf
So Zherka was right.
I’m happy to see you back my G as long as you don’t prank people you can make fun entertaining content without questioning yourself and that makes me and a lot of us happy
God bless you Jideon, it's inspiring to see you continue in your journey of faith while also entertaining your audience. It's a beacon of optimism among a mound of Godless social media personalities
No Pranks !!!!!
What about christian pranks?
Don’t come back preacher 👎🏻
I dont understand why he thinks he shouldnt do his regular prank content. Politicians claim that christian shit and theyre all actual criminals. Interrupting someones day to make millions laugh isnt a bad thing.
resume the catch a predator series if you want to spread good
Yezzirrrrrrrrr 🔥🔥
Super hyped for you to be back first of all. And not to be rude your looking a bit bulkier idk what you going through but yo health is wealth god bless
Gentle hands 💀
This is why you shouldn’t waste your God-given gifts. You are a natural entertainer; just use it for God’s glory. Trust me, you’ll get a lot more people saved this way.
Not Jidion thinking we would unsub and turn off notifications
Finally bro is back
need you to do pranks again, but i support you gang🙏
You say you are christian yet you have a menorah in the background something part of judaism?
Not 300 lbs cupcake man😭
Bro came back for the bag
man i need some of the more heartwarming videos back like the one of the teen parents and the monk one
wow no ones surprised. praise christ
I'm inclined to believe JID especially since he deleted all his videos on the main channel... But there's still this part of me that's like... What if all of this is just a huge ploy as part of Season 2 of His and Niko's "THe Biggest Menace" series... Niko won last time so for Jid to win this time he'd have to do something crazy like this
fell off
Jidion I am so happy for you dwgggg. Welcome back brooo!!!
Support from the internet ❤
Ok but what about the old videos?
Pls do pranking where people cry and get hurt and stuff and become satanic
Next is gonna fully be CoryxKenshin

MY GOAT FINALLY BACK
JidiI’m n
We're glad you're back
I think the Bible stuff is a trap, regardless. I respect you for doing what you feel is right for your walk in life. Glad you're still around. I'll check you out, but imuh pass on the Christian videos. Spent 30 years in the Bible verse. Christ is great, but the Bible is a pass for me.
JIDION DO YOUR PRANKS YOUVE NEVER HURT A SOUL YOU PUT SMILES ON MILLIONS OF PEOPLES FACES PLEASE JUST DO THE RIGHT THING AND GO BACK TO YOUR OLD WAYS
Love you bro  🤍
Blud start makin pranks again plzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
The day I’ve been waiting for 🙏🏻
Bro he's back in good way ❤❤❤❤
No no no...I was expecting this too, made the worst decision I feel and here it is proving it.  Threw everything away for the "big man in the sky" and then quickly realized that that shit was making you no money.  No I don't think you should be invited back, you made that decision yourself, you should bath in that stupid mistake you've made
bro got fat
The fact you letting a heretic convince you that the Trinity aint real, you might as well go back to your worldly life. Too much scripture fights the Arianism that your believing in.
Dang you got fat! Lol looking like a big ole teddy bear ❤
Yessirr
ANITA MAX WYNN😃😃
Yayy can't wait to see you come back in the right way we support whatever you do
Been riding with you for years bro, I'm confused now though. It's starting to seem like you're all a charade. A double minded man is unstable in all they do. Are you Gideon or Jidion?
i've missed you too jidion. glad to see you're happy man <3
Love you Jid, keep guiding people in the right direction ✝️⛪️
them checks wasn’t hitting the same anymore 😂😂
W JID

Jid is fatt
You can love Christ and still act like a menace and do pranks that at the end of the day aren't harmful to anyone man, expecially if it's social experiments like that one time you went to the most racist town in America or when you went to Bowling ..
I can’t wait
SPREAD FAITH...    [.And Now Theres Jid Burner ]

I love you jidion. You’re doing the best you can do!🙌🙌🙌
Clone
hi jidion
Lukewarm. You dipped your toes in the Kingdom and it wasn’t for you. The Lord will spit the lukewarm from His mouth. Now all you who worship men over God prove it by commenting below.
HEYYYYYYYY
Im actually excited for the gaming vid
Don’t do that to me plz
love you so much man
L
is jid back
you should consider making public speaking videos
Slay
guess whos back
go back to the prank era
lets goo
Need that money views was getting to low
no pranks = no views thats the reality🗣💯
Bro walking with the Holy Spirit!!! ❤️
This guy was single handedly my GOAT for YouTube, his content had WAYYY more pros than cons. Man... watching people like Jidion really helps boost your confidence in social settings whether its University, school, work etc... and if this mans truly back, all he has to do is pick up his crown!¬   Next time you come the UK, come to Birmingham!
“Not going back to prank era” 💀
nah bro u ruined it never come back trust me you are going to waste your time
Love from India Jidion. Praise God
I  need prayers i wanna stop watching corn
Christ is king
Sad to see you’ve become a heretic…
Bro  had to make a 3 minute video to pay the rent
He's back? 🥹
Man you have no idea how nervous I was to post this😭😭 Can't wait to entertain you guys love you all truly ❤️
What have you become
You embarrassed yourself trying to debate Muslims, hard when Islam is the truth.
We love you Jid! cant wait for the additional content!
I’m glad he’s now gonna be able to please both audiences! Huge W for everyone across the board. We get to hear the word for those that care and get to have some fun and have good conversations. 2024 is a year that’s all about change. This is gonna be our year fr y’all 💪🏽
MISSED YOU BRO ❤ WWWW
Its happening we have benn waiting 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
My question tho  No more biggest menace with Niko????

Yessir!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Bro realized religion didn't pay
Welcome back Jidion!!!
Miss you Jid glad to see you back
the comeback boutta go craaazy
Folded, it ain’t the same..
If you actually do start doing YouTube again, is it possible to re upload the biggest menace series? I miss laughing to them videos
HE’S BLACK I MEAN BACKKK
So not putting your complete faith in the Lord to provide huh!? The devil wins again. Deny yourself and your pride/ego that loves attention and monetary gains. The Lord is checking who you truly serve and it didn’t take long to go back to the world. Just because you aren’t doing pranks doesn’t mean you aren’t returning to the ways of the world.    Matthew 16:24
2024 is cool now
THE GOAT IS BACK
My boy should do some work out man, be grateful for the body god gave you
bro baited us
Stay in the faith!❤
I celebrated too soon, no pranks, reactions are still bangers tho, if jidion is against pranks then everybody respect that.
I was so scared for a moment 😭😭😭😭😭. Good to know you’re still on the path of God !!!!
Ugh we need classic jidion for content because who else is going to detect Karen’s and carry the generation of the III’ds
lovvee oldd jididonn💜💜
LETSSSSS GOOOOOO JID!  So glad to see you’re back on the grind, while still praising our lord and savior.  Welcome back, stay blessed!
W Jidion, you could be a deviuted christian and finny prankster at the same time.
Jid needs to play FNAF for our viewing pleasure.
hessssss backkkkkkkkk ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Amen God bless
don’t bait us bro😭.
Can't wait to see Jidion's new content. Never been so excited for a Youtuber returning
Insanity is repeating itself over and over again looking for a different result. I wish you the best with your walk! many people are being deceived by you and Josh right now in that discord, and I will not be a part of it!
This is exactly what I said to do. Just because you’re religious doesn’t mean you can’t do things like play video games or reaction videos.  If you’re doing reaction videos for example you can show how a Christian man should react and can be a good example for people while still being entertaining.
Finally!
I AM CRYING REAL TEARS MY LIFE FINALLY HAS MEANING AGAIN WELCOME BACK!
I'm glad ur back ☺️
Jesus loves you
LES GOO MEN
Wb
