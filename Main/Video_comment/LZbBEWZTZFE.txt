Booing someone who won Silver medal at the olympic games, lost to and beat great amateurs like Kindelan all at the age of 17. Completely under appreciated. Im glad Amir Khan made  great earning in his career, an amount most of us could only dream off.
Khan needs to stay retired, looked terrible against Brook
The booing was poor show. Khan deserves much more respect.
What a idiot, obviously they’re tryna promote a fight why would U get in the ring if you don’t wanna fight….
The Fans where so disrespectful  Amir Khan is a boxing legend and just because he lost his last fight dosnt give the fans the right to boo, they are totally out of order 😡
After 2 yrs of calling Khan & Brook shot fighters and should retire Now Eddie Hearn is trying to fix a fight between the 2 it’s a joke !!! “Now we’re going to step up the level of opposition “ but don’t expect Benn to be fighting anyone with a chance to winning anytime soon it will be the same level of opponents.. older, shot fighters who have already retired or should have retired who’s best days are Well behind them all the while the casual boxing fans believe that Benn is the greatest but for the hardcore fans has not been tested yet and it’s all a con!
The robbers that stole Khan's watch, saw him wearing it in this video.
Khan should stay away from Benn, he'll get KO'd worse than he did against Canelo, he might become a vegetable, Khan is past is prime meanwhile Benn is a hungry monster, it will be a mismatch and a potential manslaughter case for Benn.
He needs face Boots next
Khan wont last long at all. Connor throws big bangs and khan has a glass jaw. Prescott 2.0.
Remember when Eddie says he cares about fighters…… he couldn’t care less
Khan needs to retire.
Amir doesn't need that fight now , the insurance claim for his 72k watch which he had nicked by his mates will be paying up soon
British fans are full of shit . Bunch of racist bastards . Most of them are the same football hooligans that throw bananas 🍌 at black football players on the pitch during live televised matches . You can watch the videos on YouTube.    England is for white English boys ,  And that's cool 😎  If you want to be a true international superstar,  then you have to make it in the states . Not saying they are not  Racist over there because they are but as a coloured person you have a much better chance at success over there .  There's more coloured people and multi cultural communities to begin with .  Amir khan is the probably the best example of this . He gets cheered alot in USA 🇺🇸  they like and respect him and all the fighters speak of him highly also . Many have said he is one of the fastest punchers of all time . But here in UK 🇬🇧  he gets booed at events , and gets hate from other fighters like Carl froch . I absolutely hate Carl froch , whenever he talks about khan he is negative and condescending.
British owes a lot to khan. If it wasn’t for his silver medal boxing and then staying on as an amateur for a year boxing would’ve been finished in the Uk so that means no aj or any of the other. RESPECT THIS LEGEND unless you have some prejudices
Khan needs 2 stop fighting.he got absolutely fucked up in his last fight.he got plenty of£££££.don't make a fool of yourself.
Why would you boo your own countrymen who’s been an absolute warrior in the ring and fought the best? It’s quite embarrassing.
Please Khan, stay retired. Don’t turn up for the pay cheque. Your health is invaluable!
Don't do it Khan. Stay retired please. Enjoy your retirement. The Kell Brook fight was a warning. Please see commonsense and stay retired. You've had a very good career and you gave the public the fight they wanted to see in Kell Brook. Now please stay retired.
amir khan almost got ko  by the mic
The boos for Amir Khan
Khan is Washed now" he was like the drunken master in the brook fight" why would people want to see that crap again? money!
He should fight Danny garcia next that be a good fight
Hope amir Khan is OK heard he got Robbed at gun point tonight in London🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Conor the bully benn
Khan is a UK boxing legend. I don’t care what anyone says!
Ben should fight decent opponents not has been.
Oh plz amir is a washed up web cam model 😁
He don't want the heat
How these fools can booo Amir Khan like that is disrespectful. The guy fought everyone, never ducked. British public don't deserve the likes of Khan. I guess at the end of the day he made it fir himself and his family whilst people hating, get inside the ring with him then we see just how long man's last!
Khan if he has anything left a dust up with Keith Thurman and Danny Garcia rematch. Would put bums on seats.
All the top 5 absolutely demolish benn
Khan is  a neva has bin terrible fighter time to give up your a joke
Khan will get bashed
Benn gotta stop fighting bums or semi retired boxers
Conner will kill this old version of Khan. Khan's on a death wish!  Those booing are just bunch of racists!
I think Ennis is a good step up
Please retire brother before you get really hurt
A lot of ignorance from the British fans in the arena that night booing a legend who as Conor said if he achieves half of what Amir did he’ll be happy. Regardless of if you like the man or not got to give him his dues.
Screw the disrespectful fans booing the legend Amir khan
They'll always hate him coz he's a musslim
If Khan wants more paydays he should do some exhibition bouts in Dubai in front of those rich Arabs
No one who's a boxing fan want to see Khan fight again, he never had a chin now he has no chance.
Albania king marku 🤘🤘💪💪💪💪🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱
Well done, lads, for booing and disrespecting one of the great British Champions of boxing history. 🤦🏻‍♂️
This interview made no sense whatsoever.   Hearn is running around telling us Benn is a star and best welterweight in the country.  However after an explosive performance you bring a 'rival' welterweight in the ring in Amir Khan and spend the majority of the time interviewing Khan.
Not interested in a fight with Khan ... Khan is about to retire and your calling his old frail arse out ahhaah fight another young lion, let legends fight with other legends....
The crowd are a disgrace
All I can say is Khan must be a bit stupid or skint! Because Connor would definitely smash khan in round 1 or 2., Or a couple of good jabs 🥊 🥊 and a few hooks and 100% it would be the last fight he ever had. Khan is fast and talented, but sorry khan couldn’t take the punches that Connor Benn would dish out.. Not even when he was in his prime. Night night Amir Khan 👋🏼👋🏼
Benn vs Khan.. 1st round Khan like a new born baby deer trying to keep his legs underneath him
I don't think they were really booing Khan they were booing the idea of him fighting again and possibly getting seriously hurt!
Keiiiiittthhh Thurrrrmmmannn vs Conor Ben  lets do that
Call them selves boxing fan's disrespectful bastards
Connor Benn 🇬🇪 vs 🇮🇪 Stevie McKenna 💯
Clout chaser
Respect to khan what a great ambassador, true brit champion 🏆 one of the best prize fighters out the UK
Khan was a warrior Was kod by big punchers many times. Very carefully matched apart from those Best win was v Maidana which was debatable  Made crazy money  Well-done!!!!
Why they booing Khan, every person in that crowd needs a good slap.
Nonsense
One round knockout … ben don’t need has beens
Why does Benn want khan,khan has been washed up for years,pretty pathetic from Benn if you ask me
crowd no class booing Khan wannabes
Eddie wont pay what danny garcia  wants.whilst spence and crawford are about how is benn gonna become a champion?british european?lol
khan will get hurt
Conor Benn v David Avanesyan would be a great fight 2022 💥🥊
Benn should fight thurman avanesyan marku or vergil ortiz throw in boots ennis,spence and Crawford dont exist apparently.
It is very bad for UK boxing if Khan gets back in the ring, he has no punch resistance and will get badly hurt by Benn. No amount of money is worth it to see a guy get badly hurt, or even worse. Lets hope this stupid talk stops quickly and Hearn wakes up.
Khans a bum
Please no Khan is finished it would not do Connor any good Connor don't even consider this fight you will be going back the way not forward for gods sake 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Benn is very small for a Welterweight. Khan isn't big himself and he made Benn look small.
people need to give amir a break he was an amazing boxing in his prime silver medalist and ex world champion hes had a great career
Like father like son Connor benn is a machine !!!!
Khan is all done. Benn would KO him bad.
Hearn thinks the fans are stupid and ignorant. Danny and Mikey Garcia, Keith Thurman, Adrian Broner.... Broner does'nt belong in that list, he totaly shot and wasted. Bet they gonna target him.
You can't call someone elite after beating van heerden come on eddie you said yourself he can't punch the skin off rice pudding
I think Ben would knock him out within 2 minutes.Khan is finished.
Amir khan didn’t walk off because he was scared he showed respect to Conor benn and didn’t want to take the attention off Conor didn’t want to stand there like a muppet he did the talking and knew it’s better to get out the ring instead of standing there like a lemon
EDDIE SHOULD DO KAHN VS BRONER - WINNER FIGHTS BENN
Khan should stay away from Benn unless he wants early onset dementia.
Khan needs to chill.
Khan doesn't want it at this stage but he was world champion at 22 so can't say shit to him
Why would we want to see the loser of a domestic rivalry rather than the winner. Give Benn, brook
he was good, is pleasant but why does amir always choose to do the silly thing, like getting in the ring chattin kak and then later on getting knocked the fck out.  Can his Mrs send him to bed early !!
No thanks Conor pass on that one
Khan needs to stop before he gets seriously hurt maybe hospitalized
That Manchester crowd disrespectful asf amir khan was loved by these fans when he was knocking boxers out the way these fans switch sides is horrendous amir kept it humble big respect to him
benn will smash khan
What's with all the booing?
Amir Kahn, please don't fight anymore. Atleast not top 50 opponents. Against Brook, you showed us that you don't have it anymore
Would be a shit fight. Big pay day for Kahn and a easy win for benn. Stinks to high heaven
If Connor Benn fights Amir Khan, Benn will definitely end his career but the fight won't happen coz Khan will want an 80% split of the purse
We see this young  man the champion  of the future  for Britton.  Insha Allah.  Great fighter.
The crowd is a disgrace for booing Khan. He is a legend. Show some respect.
Absolute joke. Benns had more fixes than ozzy Osborne
Khan saved British boxing. Fans need to kill the booing.
Put him in with a big name fighting journeymen no good
Why are the booing him 🤔
Amir is a snake.
Question " How would you fancy a few million to take a dive "  Answer  " Err dunno "
Khan v Benn Really Khan is a total Bum he just got smashed of Kel, stop trying to jump on the Benn bandwagon
why are they booing him??? sad
Hats off to Benn held himself well and respected Amir Khan for what he's achieved. Poor from the crowd booing him
Khan shit him self
Love the humbleness of Benn and respect to Amir khan for supporting the new king of boxing..
Leave it out conner don't fight Khan what is the point ,step up not down✌️
That was very classy from Benn. Very classy.
I dont know why kahn gets so much stick, the fans used to love this man back in the day.
Khan retire
khan just teasing eddie
I hope I get this wrong but a top level good boxer puts benn away.
All the chavs booing him but Khans rolling back into his LAMBO outside as a Legend of the game, achieved everything and represented Britain like a King,  whilst these chavs are all working in mcdonalds and tesco. lets be real... uneducated dossers the lot of them.
Ignore the booing..plastic boxing fans
Khan? Ffs brook just demolished him
Amir admitted when brook kicked his arse that his heart wasn't in boxing anymore so conor doesn't need that fight
This is too disrespectful .amir has done too much
People booing because no1 wants that fight!!!!!!
Khan don't fight again enjoy your retirement
Shout out to King Khan 💪
Marku the best fight for him
Khan? 💩💩💩💩
The uk boxing fans are all wet wipes, Florian Marku brings up the potential of an Amir khan fight and he gets called out for picking a retired fighter, Benn has been ALSO saying his name last 3 fights but it’s a fight the fans wanna see? Dossers
I've loved every min of khan's career and don't wanna see him hurt or as a shadow of himself. He was criminally under appreciated during his career, that fight with maidana and even the way he lost against garcia and alvares was legendary, he come to win and would go out on his shield of he didn't.
The respect was there between Khan and Benn that's what matters
Khan is such a media loving whore, he has become a sad spectacle
Absolutely not, Khan is really asking for it if he gets in there with Benn, ridiculous
Only reason khan got booed is because he's muslim and Pakistan.  The crowd hate to see a successful Asian.  Probably most of them work in dead end jobs and hating a Asian multi millionaire
Amir always answers like a politician lol
Khan must be out of his mind...all i see against benn is a nasty ko defeat...just retire ffs surely he's got enough money by now
Respect to Conor ✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️
Those fans booing khan was sad to see  tbh
In the British side, Brook would be the next best to fight Ben then the Americans … Porter,Garcia,Thurman,Spence etc
Khan has given a million pounds to open a gym for the public. He's done so much for charity.
Atleast fight kell
Amir needs to retire.. ffs
Florian marku will put him to sleep no joke trust me and believe me. You will say why and what makes you think Florian will win honestly I can't explain but it's albanian thing when we know of what we know believe it or not we never do mistakes in what we believe.
Khan is a conman, prize fighter crap
Amir khan is a legend
Oh just go away Khan
Don’t worry Albania 🇦🇱 king Florian marku will fck both khan & ben  Ha ha 😂😂
Disgusting from the crowd, the man always risked himself by putting on a show for us and this how we repay him.
Khan being khan total embarrassment towards the end of his career but no doubt khan was one of the best on his best days but at the end of his career something caught him
Tbh it’s British fans for you when your up there up your ass when you go down they disrespect  Prime example look at Aj
It should be Adrien Broner, Kell Brook, or Florian Marku next not Amir let that man stay retired
Why don't Benn call out an American.. dude be chasing a bunch of old guys
Amir don't want no smoke! He knows at this stage of his career he'd get smashed bad and he doesn't need the money!
Oh plz..just leave Khan alone.. he's done with top lvl for sure. Conor needs to step up now.
Amir Khan won't be happy till he breaks that glass chin.
Nobody wants to see this fight, Amir Khan is finished
Absolutely disgraceful booing this 🇬🇧 boxing legend! Khan will NEVER be liked by 🇬🇧 public. And we know exactly why..
idiots booing Khan, Khan fought nothing but the best. Khan should now retire.
I like the names that Eddie said !! 🔥
Khan wins easy I’ll be right here when he does, speed kills and I’m not a khan fan before anyone says anything I was there backing Brook in Manchester
Speed kills and Khan takes Benn out don’t count him out his legs were strong against Brook and Benn doesn’t hit like Brook, khan can do this his speed is still there fastest in the world just timing is not like before but old school can still beat new school!
Lol come on, AK will get pasted
amir khan is retiring soon 3:11
Why boo Khan? Kell Brook got his win and has been forgotten already, Khan still out here enjoying and supporting the sport when he could be in his mansion somewhere, the guy loves boxing.
Khan sit your glass chin oldest ass down please get out of here, brook just done you and you are done out here in the UK 100%
Wow ,crowed booed amir Khan  What a shame , amir Khan good sports man. racism still exist . You can’t educate them people, because they are shameless lol
I'm absolutely shocked left speechless out of word's how is amir khan even considered option at this point what Will conor gane from it
Thurman would embarrass Benn even now.
I dont believe what i see amir khan still fighting why dont you get retired mister can you lost to kell brook by ko din you will fight this man conor benno come on man you get killed this time
Amir's done what he needed to do; won titles, world wide fame, £80million banked and now a celebrity. Truth be told, he's hearts not in the game anymore, which is not unheard of. Tyson suffered the same, Bowe too. What's his motivation? Remember, he was once like these young whipper snappers, accumulating wins and talking the talk. It's the past now.
Why would you boo your own countrymen who’s been an absolute warrior in the ring and fought the best? It’s quite embarrassing.
Khan has done so much for British boxing and then he gets booed like that it's disrespectfull, Khan shouldn't do anything to impress that lot that are booing him after all the great nights he's put on for us
Brook would wipe the floor with them both.
Easy pickings as they say, if you want credibility then fight Brook he still looks game for it which would make for a spectacle of a fight. I think we all can agree Amir's last performance shows he should just call it a day.
Khan become a laughing stock in uk lol 😂
Amir. Don't be so bloody ridiculous man. It'll last 30 seconds and  you'll get humiliated...again. Put your velvet smoking jacket on dude, chill and enjoy being a fan.
People who booed are a disgrace. Amir khan has fought the best never ducked anyone legend in British boxing. Dont understand how people are able to boo a man who has done so much for British boxing. It all boils down to one thing I suppose....
I don't believe this......how and y r conor benn and Eddie hearn even thinking about wanting to fight khan?  Shame.......khan shouldn't even be in the conversation after Wat brook to him................shows khan ìs a big name but washed up now...............the problem ìs Eddie hearn wants a big name but a easy fight for conor NOW to get him in the WORLD stage a stepping stone but they don't wanna pay that big name washed up fighter big $$$$ ( brook broner etc etc )
That was disrespectful from the fans part booing Khan who has been nothing but a great ambassador for the sport in and outside of the ring. Khan has given us many great nights risking his health for our entertainment and has done so much for ppl outside the sport as well. It’s true that fighters should do what makes them money because at the end of the day you’ll have ungrateful armchair fans who won’t be there for u.
Khan dont want no part of it lol .. he made that clear enough … Benn and him are at opposite ends of their careers … and after Khan performance against Brook nobody’s interested apart from the casuals … why isnt Brooks name being put forward … that would be a better ‘ next step’ .. P.s Khan was a world champion who did British boxing proud at the Olympics and as a World champion and did well for a few rounds against 2 of this generations best p4p fighters Canelo and Crawford…
Time to step up now. Fans want to see you in with the big boys!
Virgil Ortiz ?
Amir.. "I'm just enjoying my time off"  He's had years off! 🤣
Old eddie could sell a water bed to a hedgehog.
If it’s not Khan, it’ll be Darren Barker or Tommy Coyle next & the fans will fall for it once again - got to give Eddie credit, guy is a top promoter with the way he sells these pensioners as top fights
Benn vs Brook would be a better fight. Kell would outbox him pretty easy currently
Benn overrated asf lol hearn saying he's got good resume knobscratch just fought a ex kickboxer in Chris algieri😂😂😂
He's loving it fighting washed up fighter old man
Wow the Boo's to Kahn were so disrespectful i Think Amir is more loved and respected in America than England. Benn has power but thats it. He is an exciting fighter to watch.
Don't see him calling out ennis ortiz ava thurman garcia Brook Kavaliauskas khan's finished now just a bunch of bellends booing him lol hearn playing it safe calling out broner lol who's sat in jail every 2 months
Congratulations Connor, chip off the old  block…fearsome. He would smash Kel Brooke but, if Kel wants to fight, let him get on with it. Enjoy your retirement Amir, you had a fantastic career.
Connor: "Every upcoming fighter wants to challenge the best at their time"
He needs to get tested by a journeyman here in the US maybe a Josesito Lopez... Essentially someone who can take as much as they give Josesito chin is top-notch I want to see if Benn can take it in the pocket... Mexican will bring it
Hearn must be crying wondering why they all want to see Khan against him and not Brook 😅
Why not? Add Khan to the list of bums.
Khans greed is going to get him some serious brain damage.
brook next
If khan signs this fight it will be Khan vs Barrera rewritten. This time Khan being on Barrera's shoes.
KHAN DON'T WANT THAT SMOKE
Why would you fight Khan… he doesn’t bring anything.
Hearn winced with khan's light tap of body shot lol
Khan wouldn’t see the second round.
Kahn just about ben’s level.. pair of money grabbing frauds.. jus saying Fo
I feel sorry for people who paid to watch this crap, and I pity anyone who was in attendance who goes on to watch this guy fight another finished fighter like khan next
Benn Needs To Fight Someone That Actually Might actually fight back instead of punching bags!
Is Manchester racist pogba got booed heavily today now Khan is getting the same treatment?
Disgraceful, Hearn has no morals but then again he put Dave Allen in against Ortiz for 8 grand because Joshua and Whyte were too scared so not surprising.
Amir Khan is a SCARED little BIT$#.  A REAL man would have said " Yes" to this fight. He'll take the fight ONLY IF he's overpaid.  Khan's days are over. Conor deserves a better next opponent than him. Please, ANYBODY, BUT Khan.
Conor Bum loves calling out washed fighters. Ade the Matchroom DAZN shill trying to hype it and Hearn pushing Khan into the ring. The booing shows what cancer Matchroom are to boxing. Well done Khan for being sensible. 👏
leave khan not a test........go for the guy who fought davis/thurman....or broner.....all these guys who he is fighting are there for the cheque not a test at all.....thurman has heavy hands and is elite......the train can be derailed eddie if you fail to put through arduous tests.....be warned.
Benn vs Thurman would be a nice step up and still relatively dangerous. People need to get of the undefeated hype train, undefeated means F all if you have next to no title defences, no mandatory defences. Or catch weight contracts with hydration clauses, or fighting fighters when they’ve just had a major loss or not at there best. Etc it’s why Mayweather is never appreciated and Fury still gets criticised. It’s why they will never been seen as the best.
Amir khan just took his shine from him haha
He would destroy him
Lets see him fight Jaron boots Ennis   that's a fight I'd like to see
what happen to the "elite welterweight" eddie hearn was talking about?
Errol Spence stopped Van Heerdan years ago. Van Heerdan was a fresh journeyman back then. Conor needs to fight fresh new welter weights. Algieri, Van Heerdan, khan etc wrong direction. How can he grow fighting these guys.
typical from the british fans, booing khan. pathetic.
I don’t wanna see Conner and amir fight tbh.
Dude has no ambition or desire to fight a warm body.
Who want to see this crap! Come on! Khan just looking for a pay check.What a joke if they put this on..Eddie won't hear the last of it!👎 khan a sales man!
He would distrie khan 😆
Loads of people on here asking about the booing.  Its because they are fed up of washed up fighters like Khan trying to bull-s another payday.
Khan didnt want that smoke!
All the racists and jealous haters booeing Khan, keep it up as hate comes back on you 😉
Khan 😂😂😂
Why was Kahn getting booed? 🤣
Amir desperately trying to stay relevant, he’s absolutely shot and wasn’t remotely interested in Conor before Brook hammered him….
Benn can punch the tools are there to see but I can't believe in him properly till he actually fights a decent name around his own age who can actually punch a bit themselves
Ah fuk of would ye.
Joke of a fight. That's exactly the sort of opponent that would have beat a peak Khan.
Stop with the bullshit please this is ridiculous 🤦🏻‍♂️
Conor benn overrated. What a dead fighter he had for a opponent
Shameless...  This hype train is out of control. 2:45 Hearn literally calls him elite and a superstar @ 3:26.  Then goes onto say Brook is the perfect fight next but you cut that off.  Avanesyan is apparently too high risk and too low reward ie will derail the hype train in 6 rounds so we're going nowhere near him.
Khan out in one round
Benn v Brook would be great but Conor would eat Khan for breakfast now.
He don’t want that smoke
What a joker this khan kid is, an absolute bluffer, chin of ice, retire and count yourself lucky you can still talk
Khan swerved that nicely 😅😂
Eddie no one wants to see this fight. Just step Connor benn up he looks ready for it let’s see if he is.
Always worth betting on 1st or 2nd ko. Thanks Ben
Why the idiots booing khan, he's always boxed the best around and has done well for British boxing.
Is Khan on a death wish?
This is hilarious
Conor Benn will surpass his father. He is absolutely terrifying. An absolute beast.
You need a proper fight like Danny Garcia,Thurman not that washed up Indian
Crowd is booing because they know Matchroom over-paying washed up ex-champions instead of putting him in with other contenders.
Amir needs to think about his mental health, Conor is way to strong for amir and this could be a deadly fight.
What a fucking joke....
Hate towards Khan is unreal!
Matchroom trying to hype a fight against Khan after Eddie's been saying for months that he's finished.   Classic 😂😂
Lads lock your grandads up! Benns looking for his next opponent.
As Hearn says, he will have 5-6 years at the top level competing against top level fighters, there is NO NEED to rush just because casuals on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter get all upset and want to see people thrown in at the deep end.  In his 21st fight Terence Crawford boxed a retiring Alejandro Sanabria.  In his 21st fight Erol Spence fought Leonard Bundu. A bang average Italian.  In his 21st fight Keith Thurman fought Jesus Soto Karass. You won’t know him.   All 3 are fighters Benn should be looking to emulate in one way or another, why? Because they are successful and did/do things the right way.
Hasbeen tour continues.
Benn didn't have an extensive Amateur career........he's still needs the experience but he's bringing brought along nicely. I actually think he's the most improved boxer in pro world boxing today. He's improving at a very alarming rate and that's down to sheer hard work. He really does have his Pops' mannerisms........attitude and is a more polished version of his Pops in terms of fighting style. He has the same drive, determination and never-say-die attitude...just like his Pops.  I feel he's now ready for another step up in comp. He's gonna be a world champ in the near future......watch.
Most confusing post fight interview
Khan looks so excited to get sparked out 😂 fair play
Why does he only fight washed up opponents
Fight a puncher not pillow fisted guys ffs! Khan is shot too bits.
Just here to laugh at the haters in the comments, with no idea about boxing or life..
If the Conor fight doesn't go ahead I'll happily take Amir out for some Chicken Wings .......sorry legs.
Rubbish Conning the British  public woke matchroom
RETIRE!!!
i like Amir khan i don't want him to get hurt and he would get hurt.
Unnecessary fight!🤦🏻‍♂️
This is just plain embarrassing, and you just know its gonna be washed up Adrian Broner nexr.. 😳
I wonder which semi retired fight is next. Broner would fit the bill. Old, barely fights, no -puncher. Perfect!
It’s all down to Eddie he won’t give Benn anyone in the top 10 I guarantee the next fight is the same wish I could bet on it 🤡
No thanks
Benn vs eubank Jr needs to happen 🥊🥊💥
This is my issue with Benn.   Talks about wanting to fight the best and then fights guys like Van Heerden and now he wants Khan.
Lol there’re really trying to set up a fight with a shot to bits Khan. 😂😂😂 oh dear
Amir wants 10m, not happening
It is very funny when Marku called out Khan every single person in the UK was saying he should retire, and now that Benn wants to fight him the crowd cheers for this fight. Some people are ridiculous
Khans done keep him out of the ring, period
Khan clearly doesn't want it
