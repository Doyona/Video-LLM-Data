The barrel imploded at the start of the video
Just curious, outside of too much yelling at times, why would anyone not watch till the end?

Wow the implosion effect on the first barrel was super cool

The barrel collapsed cuz a fist push the bottom out so far.

Old Macdonald had a farm🥬🥒🌽🥝🍅
You should get a rubber mat cut in a circle that is slightly bigger than the opening of the barrel.  Put that on top after it is filled with water.  Then drop the object on top.  The rubber should act like a gasket and push all the water out of the side pipes.  In theory.  I guess.  I don't know.  Either way it should be interesting.
Anyone Knows for how much the sweater was sold in the end?
Now I remember why I loved being there (even 30 years ago ;P)

You should take a round piece of wood or other material that can float on the water and make it a tight fit to force the water down and out the tubes to a greater degree....

The hand bulged out the bass of the drum creating a vacuum inside it and that collapsed the drum.
Oldmicdonad😅
I'm at 5:02 explanation of why barrel crumbled. I'm no expert or scientist, but I think a vacuum was created by the water ejecting from the bottom no air was allowed to take it place, so the metal sucked inward... very impressive to watch slow

So cool Bruce hit the water with such force it created a vacuum and crushed the drum with the vacuum…. Wow awesome

Should put like a plate on top of the barrel that way when hulk's fish hits instead of the water going out around the fist it gets pushed straight down and out the tubes where the tennis balls are! That would create massive pressure in the barrel to launch the balls

Also spike ball vs. giant hammer!!!!
I'd love to see a spike ball that is 100% the weight capacity of the winch.  I feel likr this would really represent the full potential impact of the tower itself.  I bet it would go through twice the pavers...mega carnage!!!
Use all your big weapons against each other
I think that the spikes on the side are superfluous and just get in the way.
You should keep adding 10 layers every video, to see how many it can stop!
The thing landed on the bottom and fucking TWISTED!!
Still one of the all-time great slowys
The amount of science and math that goes into getting the things to drop directly inside the drums without touching the sides or even completely missing is commendable. Def deserves a like and sub for that.
Old McDonald had a farm
There's a lot of good fun happening in this video, but one thing stands out: Stanford cannot whistle  :-)
Was this the last vid at the tower?
Idea for the next time you fellas collapse a barrel around something. You can use the jack in your car. I know well at least older motor vehicles have a spare tire and jacking kit. I have a 2006 dodge Dakota it has a simple screw/scissor type jack it can lift a 5270 lbs truck I'm sure it or a similar spare tire jack could open the barrel up.
You boys need to partner up with that Physics Lady.
I did not see the attachment at 10:49 and was so confused on how he could jump of it while it was floating 😂
I just watched in a row to the end!
So i recommend trying to drop 1 truck tyre with rim filled with air and another filled with water on giant axe shouldn't bounce as per previous video would look great. :D
Uhh yea no only one was recognizable 😂😂 other then bingo it was bear nessicities
Stanford you singed the jungle book

I'd suggest the Bernoulli Effect for why the drum collapsed. The water rushing out at high velocity causes a pressure drop on the sides which pulls them in.

5:12 What makes the drum collapse is that when the water is jetting out (through the top and side pipes) it prevents air from re-entering the volume, as the water's mass far exceeds that of air; it's pushing out a good deal of air. (Look closely and you'll see there's a brief time lag from when the water is escaping and the drum collapsing. 4:55) This causes there to be a negative pressure within the drum allowing atmospheric pressure to push in collapsing the drum. There is NO pulling in.

Not a valid comparison between the fist and spike ball as there were fewer pavers for the spike ball resulting in a greater distance traveled to pick up greater speed. Additionally they were placed on very different foundations which would greatly impact the collision dynamics.
Please drop the spiky ball on people thank you - Jack
Molto bene grazie Evitaeterna.-vc
Yeet
the vacuum collapse of the barrel is really cool to see.

I DON'T know why they didn't just hook the crane to the fist inside of the barrel and drop it to get it out, surely that would have worked lol

Actual water can be compressed it just takes massive amounts of pressure to do so this is use for industrial applications such as water cutters which are used to precisely cut metals

These boys are amazing, I've watched lots of their videos - but why oh why is there a 45m tower in Perth dedicated to dropping things from a great height?
for gaunson the pressure of the barrel would change which would create a vacuum which would then suck the barrel essentially into itself causing it to collapse
Old McDonald’s, bear necessity
that was cool how the water imploded because I made a vacuum effect from the water leaving so fast
what I find really interesting about the first drop and the crumple is that, by all rights, there shouldn't have been a vacuum in that tank. The fist wasn't anywhere close to a perfect fit around the tank and by the time the water left the tank it wasn't moving as one single unit. I guess that, because there was so little room for the water to travel through, the tubes and between the fist and the side of the tank, it all squished together to be enough to act as a temporary seal for long enough to make a complete vacuum. Really cool!
old McDonald had a farm, you can't always get what you want, what you know, and the bare necessities.

they need a seperate channel for Science, where they explain the physics of their drops and such.

That's what happend when Chuck Norris's balls dropped
The first barrel; was it the water pressure that collapsed the barrel behind "Bruce"? It seems like that, and if so, that's so awesome.
Eeeeeeaaaaaaaaaa I recognize all the songs but names just don't. I could always cheat and use a search-by-humming thing but that boring and also cheating so... Gosh what is that song

Gaunson the water displacement that Brucey created actually created a negative pressure effect that when Brucey continued through the space forced the air around the barrel to compress and fill the space that it no longer occupied. In other words it Brucey caused a depressurization effect were upon impact not only was the water forced out but the air moved into the space that Brucey was still moving through compressing and twisting the metal.
THE REASON WHY THE BARREL DID THAT IS BECAUSE YOU GUYS CAUSED WHAT THEY CALL AN IMPLODING EFFECT RESEARCH IT ON SUBMARINES GOD BLESS YOU
Are you accounting for any pavers broken from the bottom up?
First song EIE I/O
He's actually right, there's a vacuum behind the fist, and the air pressure around the can crushed it inwards.

How many Rexy's stops a Recking ball
My idea on what happened to the first barrel is that the bottom of the barrel went down and pushed the bottom sides out and the middle in its. It's not confirmed but that's my idea.
When you guys drop the fist or atlas stone into the barrels of water, there needs to be a steel plate on top of the water to compress the water better

Second time watching and I have a request. Try to make dessert using smashed food of your choice. Points if it comes together well and multiple points if it’s edible. Or you could shoot a plate randomly with an arrow and on each plate is a number and you have to make something with it. I just want to see culinary chaos😅 P.S. The numbers will be on the back of the plates so you can’t see it. You have to shoot 3-4 plates.

I think gaunson go it half right, I think he's missing the fact that the bottom got crushed and collapsed. When you throw a vacuum into the mix, it crushes the whole barrel.

Gaunson was actually kinda right. The reason the barrel crumpled in on itself is because (and this is my best judgment, I'm not majoring in physics) after the water left the barrel, it left behind a vacuum if you will and it just sucked the barrel in because the air couldn't fill the space fast enough

The whistle tune is oh McDonald had a farm!
Ideia for video: Dump some gallons of gasoline in a big swimming pool (just enough to make a 1mm floating layer) and then lit It with a flaming arrow (just like the torch of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics). The noise and flame will be awesome, and the thin layer of gasoline will burn fast, causing no damage to the pool.

One of the four songs is bare necessities
5:31 what happend is that it hit the bottom and then th chock made the barrel collapse
You should re do that experiment with a wooden plate floating on the water for a better seal and more pressure / better energy transfer to the balls
The first song was bingo love your videos btw
sing sing sing synchronization

Old McDonald
Old mcdonald
Yeah I think he’s more or less correct but I believe it required the sudden displacement of the majority of the water to create the pressure differential, as you’ll notice the barrel doesn’t collapse instantly, but only once the water has exited the barrel. So it wasn’t just the hammer hitting it creating a void, so much as the fist imparted a tremendous amount of energy that attempted to compress the water and the harder something is to compress the more it moves when you try to compress it. Therefore when the energy was transferred to the water it displaced it causing the pressure differential that was more than the metal in the barrel could take. Another possibility would’ve likely been the barrel simply bursting when the energy was transferred to the water.

What is the song oh McDonald had a farm
The whistle song was bingo
5:45   I think with the fist hit the can got pushed up (like when you drop something heavy on something flat, newtons 3rd law) if we assume the fist has a mass of 60kg then it would have a weight of 588.6 newtons, which is how much force the can would push up with. but that wouldn't give enough momentum to push the can up (I=P=mv). the can would have a velocity around what the fist had when it hit but we cant figure that out, since the sides of the can still moved up it pulled it self and curved in
Nice

Bro it broke rexis neck
That 3rd whistle was the bear necessities
I got 2 balls    Thats what she said
Gaunson was almost right. If you watch a clip of a mantis shrimp punching, you'll notice it creates a bubble that instantly implodes (because there is no air to actually form the bubble from). The same effect applies here. If the drum had been transparent, you would've seen a flash of light.  This "cavity" in the water needs to be replaced right away, but there's neither air nor water to replace it with anymore, so it tries to suck the air out from outside the drum, resulting in the drum getting sucked in.  This is the exact same effect that causes the pop you can sometimes hear when you pull your finger.
spike let's goooooo
Axe vs Wrecking ball!
The whistle 🤯🤢 irritated me so much 🤣
vacuum
Just notice he said my name 😂
The first one was old McDonald had a farm
Science with Gaunson is close. The water exits the can and the remaining air in the bottom in the can is at lower pressure than the air on the outside of the can. The pressure of the outside of the can (atmospheric pressure) is what causes the can to crunch. Atmospheric pressure is wicked strong

Bingo
Old McDonald’s is the song??
the bear balù song is the best part of the video
ald mac doned had a fame
old macdonald song
Gaunson is almost right. The secret is the inertia of water. Water is heavy, and the hulk fist hit it and pushed it out with so much force, that it accelerated to high speeds, leaving the barrel and leaving a vacuum behind, not being pulled back in simply because of inertia. The vacuum was apparently strong enough to make the atmosphere crush the barrel.
Here’s an idea. Spiked ball vs. fridge
Bingo
Being on a pallet instead of the ground also helped crack more. It's like when martial artist put blocks on wood to break. Give the concrete room to buckle and snap instead of to compress and expand. Believe it or not but concrete snaps easier than it squashes.
I Loved when you drop the ball on the piano
Thinking of cool slow Mo clips, have you guys thought about putting something in liquid nitrogen then dropping the fist or spiked ball on it?
What killed the barrel was indeed vacuum. The fist accelerated the water up and to the sides. But even as the fist stopped moving, the water was still moving up. And since no air could come from the sides either, vacuum was created. Thus, the barrel was squished by air pressure from the outside.

Actually the explanation for why the barrel collapsed inward is because when it hit bottom, bending the bottom outward deforming the barrel, that bent the walls inward.  Not because of the water. Lmao.

Telling us what you had so far to eat Scott is not something you need to share in a video because it’s not important OK like seriously
Personally I would suggest starting by cutting out the bottom of the barrel. If that fails then you’re going to have to cut down one of the sides of the barrel and just rip the sucker open
I don’t know whether or not yet you boys have gotten Bruce out of the black barrel yet but I would suggest that if you have not yet gotten Bruce out I would suggest using a circular saw or some small electric saw that has a blade that has the ability to cut through metal or whatever that barrel is made of
Sending Bruce down into the black barrel was not a good idea boys
Well done again boys with a nice video

First one is  eieio
if it was pulling air in it would blow up. the reason it collapsed was due to the sudden depressurization of the tank and the water coming out made a void with lower pressure inside the tank so the atmospheric forces pushed the container inside itself   edit: the reason the second one didnt collapse was because it got puntured
I say we do the spike ball v.s. the axe

Why does the wrecking ball remind me of bowsers turtle shell?
But to be fair to brucie u tried to smash 60 on the ground and those 44 were on a pallet u should do both the same way

You guys should put a metal plate suspended on the top of the middle barrel filled with water (somehow get it to suspend there) and that way you minimize the water escaping through the top and direct most of it out the small diameter side channels

Got bored doing physics revision for my year 12 exam so did some calculations for ur spiked ball. Dropped from the 45 meter tower it strikes at 106.9km/h with a force of 4351.2 newtons of force!! This generates around 196000 joules of kinetic energy

so if the ball is 444kg, and the tower is 45m, assuming the concrete stack is about 1.8mtall, then due to conservation of energy, the kinetic energy at the very top of the stack will (roughly b/c air resistance) be equal to the difference in gravitational potential energy between the tower and the top of the pavers. so KE ~ Ug ~ mg(h2 - h1) so KE ~ Ug ~ (444)(9.81)(45-1.8)  so KE ~ Ug ~ 188163J of kinetic energy at impact, roughly  188kJ. damn.  also, since KE = .5m*(v^2), v=sqrt((2KE)/m) v=sqrt((376327)/444), v=sqrt(847) so the speed at impact at the top of the stack should be roughly (again b/c air resistance) 29 m/s

Probably been said before, but in order to eject water out of the tubes (spectacularly) of the barrel the diameter of the tubes collectively need to equal at least the diameter of the entire barrel. Even then the water would have trouble moving through them that quickly. Still fun to watch. Just making the Mark Rober statement.

The reason the barrel crushed that way is because of pressure. You have a heavy object impacting the water in the barrel with great force, forcing a large volume of water out through the top and the pipes on the side. This created an area with lower pressure than the air outside it, and so it crumpled inwards. Same kind of effect you get when you vacuum all the air out of a tin can or balloon.

After all this time, having watched so many HR videos, I only now got to know what the 44 club actually is and that I'm very much a part of it!
i think when the fist hit the bottom of the barrel it pushed the bottom rim of the barrel in folding it and folding the sides in with it.
Try the pavers on a metal sheet at the bottom
Hi
Why does the tower looks like it is bending

How about dropping spike tyson on to an upright standing car
I think the killer of the Devil is good
There are so many clips in this video that would fit on r/unexpected, like the one where (one of them, idk who) yells "SPONGEBOB!" And then the jet ski hits the axe, and the one where (once again idk who) says "LEROY!" and then the spike ball demolishes the pile of concrete

Spike vs engine block
They should have a Rexy made of tungsten to drop on stuff
44 club i will watch all the new videos till the end
I have another theory for you Gaunson... it actually crushed due to Hulk trying exit the bottom of the drum. At the time the fist meets the resistance of the ground the deformation of the bottom is putting significant stress on the sidewall of the barrel. The wall's path of least resistance is in. Like when you dig a hole, put a blanket over said hole and someone falls in the hole the blanket has nowhere to go but around the object trying to pass through it. See... 4:30-4:35 and 4:43
This may be a stupid idea and probably very dangerous , what if you heated spike Tyson up to a hot temperature and dropped it on a block of ice or anything else you crazy lads think of
So, the reason the barrel collapsed was the fast moving water created low pressure Inside the barrel. Then there was more pressure outside than inside, and it collapsed inwards.

Try to put in the barrel boiling fat and around the barrel some little fire spots, then smash the fist in the boiling fat
Old McDonald was the song
the Fist pushed the bottom of the barrel out and it created a void above the fist in the drum, cant compress water so it just collapsed the drum with air arround it.
You should totally add a lid to the barrel so it compresses and pushes that water even more!

Re: Gaunson's Physics Analysis  If the fist created a vacuum that imploded the barrel, why didn't the atlas stone create the same vacuum on it's drop?  I want to suggest that an alternative cause was the fist had enough momentum when it smashed the bottom of the barrel that it dislodged the bottom circular plate, thus, the sidewalls lost all rigidity, and the tension of the bottom circular plate being dislodged sucked in the side walls.  For whatever reason, I just have a hard time accepting the notion that a "vacuum" (or low pressure area with enough force to suck in the side walls) was the culprit.  It would be neat to see @How Ridiculous give the fist a few more drops with different barrel configurations (one with no extruding side tubes, one with side tubes that allow air inflow... probably requiring a one-way valve)... etc.

Do you guys have any concerns on what is going on with the Nazi style rule happening in your country? Or are you paid to “just be the entertainment and distraction?”
You know, Tyson probably could have made it through even more of them if you didn't have the pavers on a pallet. It lost a bit of energy when the pallet broke underneath it. Maybe try stacking them on a steal plate next time?

for every force there is an equal and opposite reaction, mah boi bruce hit down sending the water shooting up, as the water shot up and bruce shot out the bottom so much was leaving that there was no where for the barrel to intake any air/matter so it vacuumed the barrel into a squash
you should do how many skids it will go through
do 100 cans of spray paint with Bruce

jenny craig? i hardly know him
Yeah, I think the science about the drum imploding was right; The fist displaced the water so forcefully that it ejected a greater volume of water than the fist volumetrically displaced. With enough momentum to resist vacuum force, the water left a low-pressure zone behind it, around the fist. This low-pressure zone pulled the sides of the drum inwards, which, combined with the fist's impact on the bottom of the drum, caused a structural failure, and so it imploded.

Instead of water... petrol with a flare on top of Hulk's fist.  BTW, When the fist was compressing the water, it also distended the bottom by doing so.  Without the flat plane of the bottom, the sides crumpled.

the first one
Anyone wanna see a ballistics dummy under the ball
the song is old farmer
Old mcdonald
Was Bruce’s on a pallet?
Old McDonald had a farm
Can you do one with a safe again But with the camera inside
If they’ve not already they need to do something with Gav and Dan.
I've been subscribed for 10 years crazy stuff, was 9 when I first saw your videos now I'm 21 is mad #44 club
old MacDonalds farm
Old mick Donald had a form
they should have a second channel where it is just the drops, because sometimes i like all the commentary and other times i just wanna some stuff explode
So how do I get this job
Fisrst whistle song.it was old McDonald had a farm
Technically a number between 1 and 5 would only be 2,3, or 4. So both of their guesses were out of the range.
Call the spike ball “spike Tyson “
Gotta cut out Bruce with an angle grinder
B-I-N-G-O and BINGO was his NAME O
Those patio pavers are more brick than concrete. Not dense not strong.
old McDonald was out of tune
Old mik donled had a farm
I like how editor Greg just knows his shit. "yah it's called a vacuum". Always the quiet ones that know the most.
Does this remind anyone of something
SO HOW DO YOU GUYS SPLIT UP YOUR MONEY MADE FROM THESE VIDEOS? AND HOW MUCH HAVE YOU MADE THIS YEAR INQUIRING MINDS WANT TO KNOW THANKS😁
Can I be in the 44 club if I've watched 85-99% of your vids
14:00 if you actually wana see the part of the video you clicked on this for
CALL THE SPIKE BALL BRUTUS !! who agrees?
Try to dump The spiked ball on the giant axe 😮 Like this comment If y’all think that’ll be nice! 😂
Hello DENZEL! It's hit the spike ball Gaunson; that killed me!
You should put a lid slightly smaller than the width of the barrel to force the water out of the pipes
Can you drop bowling balls from 165m damn in Switzerland to exercise balls at the bottom? That would be epic?

I legit can't figure out why the Barrell seemed to have negative pressure.  I would love to see a scientific explanation of this.
I’ve been watching for a year now and I don’t know which of you is which
You guys should do pop darts (a game using suction cup darts, can be found on amazon) from the tower, or make giant sized ones.
Old staffed had a farm er er oi
Mary had a little lamb
Gaunson = Bernoulli
someone uped their production eh? love the vid! :D
Old McDonald, Bare Nessesities, and, I don't know the rest!
Been watching your vides for like 2 years and didn't know what the 44 club was. It turns out I'm a part of it!
How many likes for Bruce V Spike "Geronimo" Tyson
6:00 out of pitch old MacDonald
Ok, hear me out....Demo Ranch/44 Club drop, shoot, explode extravaganza!!!! How Good!?! Don't tell Mere!!!
shotta gotta fatty, black and yellow, rapgod, and the itsy bitsy spider
For some reason I always thought the 44 club was because maybe you guys like Hank Aaron
The 1st whistling song was paradise city by guns N. roses
You should have a sheet of 3/8" steel rolled into a barrel so that it will hold up to the atlas stone and Bruce. Use schedule 40 pipe for the tubes to shoot things out of. To top it off, put a piece of plywood just smaller than the inside diameter of the barrel to help force the water out the tubes.
How about dropping Spike Tyson on Bruce?
Old MacDonald You can't always get what you want What you know Bear necessities
Leeroy...!
WHAT IF YOU MEASURE THE MAGNITUDE ON EVERY DROP?I THINK IT WOULD BE INTERESTING...
you should light it on fire and then drop it
Old MacDonald had a farm EIEIO
you boys not able to clean up the sand?
Stanford, are you kidding me? Lol
old mac Donald
Tune is old Mac Donald had a fram
I think the fist displaced so much water so fast that there wasn't enough space or time for air to re-enter the barrel so it collapsed under the weight of  normal atmospheric pressure.

I mostly only watch the end of your videos, the rest is mostly boring.
What about lid on the barrel when you drop 🤔
Old mcdonald had a farm
Huh. Welcome back into my recommended bar guys. Haven’t seen y’all for a year.
This video makes me wonder what would happen if you dropped hulks fist into a 55 gallon drum of glitter🤔
5:35 Gaunson is correct, the impact of Bruce created a void (vacuum) within the displaced water. Since nothing filled that void, with the water displaced out of the drum, the ambient air pressure crushed it.
I’ll be living in the land of Canaan , it is well with my soul, He got up,He made a way for me
GIANT PLUMB BOB!!!!!!
I want the see a ballistic dummy versus the axe.
mace face
Next video request drop the spike ball on the strongest trampoline and how high it can bounce ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is ESPN Karate board breaking on steroids
I think it just hit the bottom and buckled the in
Nice seeing editor Jack with Corridor merch
should call it spike tyson
I still think bowser sounds better than spike Tyson
Imagine getting hit by spike tyson holy molyyyyy
It is old MacDonald had farm song
Bowser should be the spike ball name
I guess that jetski was an introvert, because it really didn't seem to want to get axed a question SuperVinlin
You boys are an upbeat medicine for the depressing times we live in. God bless you and I hope you can survive  through the horribleness that is going on in Australia and the world. Thank you.

Name of the spike ball is king of spike
I'm surprised with Derek's love of basketball yall dont have a number 44 jersey in the merch store
old McDonald had a farm
Now just a thought, but would be Legendary but Bruce vs Spike who would win?
5:00  vacuum is look like fuck u
Mary had a little lamb
Interesting it caused a vacuum cause it was so strange but awesome. love these vids
they never pin you anymore
See, the thing about Heron is, well... I ain't saying he a hole-digger, but... 😉
Marry had a lil lam heh
To better explain what Gaunson was saying (for those who are interested), when the hulk fist was pushing all of the water out of the barrel, there was nothing to replace the water so it made a temporary vacuum inside the barrel. This vacuum was stronger than the metal in the barrel and it caused it to collapse in on itself.
How much force you think that is between each paver! That would take a hand right off!
Great explanation for Bruce collapsing, rather than ripping open, the barrel of water.

0:53 Did I hear that right?...
Actually as the water rushed out of the drum, there was no air in the drum. So as the water rushed up and out it created a vacuum and sucked the drum in causing an implosion.
Bear necessities
Ah yes I love the metric and imperial matchup in the title
I’m pretty curious as to what’s actually going on in Australia with the police and what not.
Nice Corridor Digital Hoodie :D
I dont know if you did or not but you should have tried to drop bruce a few time maybe it would have broke through.... anything for science
do Spike Tyson vs Tungsten cube
what do you guys think of making a giant catapult, or like a giant see-saw to launch stuff.
How do guys even afford this tower/crane set-up, let alone all the stuff you're smashing apart?
Jungle book😙🌬🎵🎶🎵
Make a sturdy funnel connected to a loop on the end, the drop round stuff like an atlas stone with the hook on the inside. Or 10000 pin pong balls, orbs, water mellons.   Example of design     Y OJ  Items drop into the funnel Y slide through the Tunnel J and go into the Loop O
hows australia going?
"I'm thinking of a number between 0-5." "6" Made my YEAR
I love hr videos
I think the song is little mary had a lamb. Just from the first part.
Cool you brought back some of the old stuff
You basically turned a jet ski into a kayak
Spike’s impact on the stack of pavers collapsed the wood skid, leaving the bottom of the stack unsupported. Which is probably why those broke.
the shovel viddy is still my fave!

you should drop different items onto a ballistics gel body

Old McDonald had a farm
For the first drop I think it's both the fist hitting the bottom and the vacuum created that causes the drum to implode the way it does. Pretty neat unintended reaction if you ask me.
old McDonald had a farm  You can't always get what you want I don't care I love it bear Necessities
Thousands of years from now the giant axe head will be berried and people will be like “giants did exist”😮😮😧😧
that guess a number could be some good merch
The really do be “old Mc Donald” tho
Ok, normal I just watch these for the fun and jokes but I am fascinated by the compress 55-gallon drum anyone know the physics behind it?
Bruce’s super cute
Old McDonald had a farm
Physics professor here: Not thinking too hard about this on my day off, but your explanation for the collapsing drum is pretty plausible. Seeing how the implosion happened after the hit and came in from all sides, it's likely that the water was displaced from the drum in such a way that air couldn't get in, creating a partial vacuum inside the drum. The results are remarkably similar to when you use sudden changes in temperature to decrease the pressure inside a similar drum.
Yeah nah
I wonder if you could get a couple of the folks from Washington DC to come help you... as targets???

The first song was a very out of tune old McDonald
With a onik onik there and a oink
I really like your videos but I think you should all make mannequins of yourselves put them in shirts and jogging pants with the iconic 44 logo on it and then drop one of these heavy it's heavy items on it. And after you do that the clothes at the mannequins are wearing you should auction off.

8:55 Hi :)
First song of whistle Old McDonald had a farm
"If you don't guess that one, you need to give up now."  If you can't whistle the right notes... Jk. Lovely key change.
The shovel video had me rolling.
If you pause it at 15:16 and took the bottom part of the stack off and put the remaining stack with the 44 on it on a t-shirt I guarantee that it will be a hot seller. Especially since the 44 is cracked I’d definitely buy it
heres a little trick i used to use fishing from a pier. u need a tarpaulin with the hook holes. and 4 bundgy hook cords. attach the two top corners to the hand rail of the tower from the direction the wind is coming from. flick the tarp over the edge and attach the bottom corners to the bottom of the rail with the other 2 bundgies. then u have a little wind breaker.
Can we get Spike Tyson vs a Herren hight block of marble?

Bingo was his name O is what your whistling
they forget to put the cute dinosaur next to the concrete!!!
You need a best of the SLOW MO SHOTS - I bet that would get massive views - also not a fair comparison as you needed to have the brick stack to be the same height because the concrete does supply some give and this could affect how effectively the force was transferred.  A larger stack could mean less tiles cracked.
Geronimo is incredibly inappropriate, please reconsider.
Hmmm 6?  He just wanted to be on top and the center of attention. - it made a vacuum - i think I’m in the 42 1/3 club
Hello from the USA..... Bowling Green, Ky. So here's an idea .....  Do another set of barrels because this was an awesome video. In the pipes you place cubed ice, crushed ice, rubber balls. The pipe options are limitless. The thought just entered my mind..... Dye the ice cubes and crushed ice.
LEEEEROOOOY!

Cut a piece of wood to just fit the barrel. It will act as a plunger when bruce hits.
I think spike Tyson could get through more pavers if the pallet hadn’t given out.
one was bear sesimes or from jungle book
Lol. 6
You lads are top class .....respect.... here is a idea for your hulk fist...
Old Spike went though more because of the pallet the drop with Bruce was on the ground
Think the barrel should be filled just over half way instead of going all the way

Should do an episode with ballistic dummies to show the dangers of these drops. Slightly morbid yeah but it’s something I’ve been wondering about, kinda like the cartoon piano drops. Love the content guys!
maybe a floating lid in the drum so that the water can't escape the top of the drum????
You’re losing a lot of pressure by not having a lid on the drum. If you guys put a lid on the oil drum there would be much more pressure pushing out of the tubes on the side, because the water wouldn’t be able to go up as easily. Higher pressure=more height.  Those tennis balls would hit the upper atmosphere

all mack donled hade a farm
I think the reason Bruce got stuck was more that it pulled on the bottom of the barrel and stressed the side of it and it collapsed.
Told mick donold
Looked very 9-11
Great editing on this one, boys! (Or probably mostly Jack!)
These slow-motions shots were brilliant! Well done guys, and thanks for the great video! 💜💚🧡
Put small spacers between the pavers!!!!!
Would you be able to lift up the big axe
IK they mainly do stuff w/ heights... but if they could incorporate somehow, shooting a gun(s),, I'd fuckin love to see how their slowy caps a bullet!!! 😄 maybe shooting a 9mm down at a target or sumthin' 🤔🤷‍♀️
the boys are getting so good at dropping stuff on target l reckon they could hit a fly on the sand with a spike tyson spike.
Have they ever dropped anything on ballistic gel??
What happened to the sword?? I only remember one video dropping it. I guess I might have missed its demise in a members only video?
Next dropping item should be named Capin Crunch
Great Idea: drop stuf at night! With Sparks and other fire things
Name for spikey ball: Bowser!
Next time y’all do the dyed water, you should lay out white hr shirts/other merch to make special editions
Stanford is whistling old McDonald had a farm
Why not just drop Bruce again, barrel and all and see if he punches through?
throw axe on axe
Old Mcdonald had a farm one for the kids and the kids hidden inside us all 😉
So Mac do land had a farm song
honestly i say you just drop Bruce still in the drum, thats character development right there
So science with Gaunson was more or less bang on. The effect is called atmospheric pressure. The speed that the water was forced out of the drum caused a vacuum as air couldn’t get in to replace the water causing atmospheric pressure to crush the cylinder in. Put your finger over the end of a cheap straw then suck the other end it’s the same concept as the straw is crushed without air in it.
The first song Stanford whistled was "ah vous dirais je maman", which was a French folk tune, but Mozart wrote '12 variations' on it, so it's usually attributed to him. That music has been used for the following, amongst others: Old McDonald The Alphabet song (in English) Baa Baa Black Sheep and - Twinkle Twinkle little star. He also whistled "You can't always get what you want", "I don't care, I love it", and "Bear Necessities"
Vid idea   Atlas stone vs axe
You guys need to have a heavy Rexy head made
You still do you have a giant dart tried to do it with the concrete pavers
Will the giant axe ever get sharpened ?

I’m shocked for how long you guys have been doing this how bad you all are at physics lol
Rexy is the Steve-o of the group
Should make some Science with Gaunson merch lol
normaly it unsadiffies me when things get destroyed but these people sadisfy me
The barrel was interesting. As the water was pushed out, it created a pressure imbalance due to a vacuum. The barrel crumpled as the pressure equalised itself.
Can't compress lava, right? Drop the Spiked Wrecking Ball in an active volcano...
Old Macdonold
I love the Tesla hat!
Old mac donald had a farm
You need a round plate (metal? wood?) with a tiny bit smaller circumference than the barrel... just sittin' on top of the water. When the beast hits it, nothing can escape from the top, so all that energy goes out the side pipes. My guess, it just fricking destroys the barrel. Too much too fast and that energy just goes, yeah, we'll get out this way, and shatters the barrel.
COMMTEST!!!! “Old McDonald had a Farm” “You Can’t always get what you want” “Shut Up And Dance With Me” “Bear Necessities”

He is 100% correct on why it imploded
When does the video come of them putting the concrete back together?
I can't count how many times I've watched your videos but what with all the quick cuts I STILL don't really know who is who. How about a group photo with circles and arrows pointing out names to faces? Or is it just me? Just another yank from Oregon.
Cut a plywood disk just smaller than the inside of the barrel (wood floats) for the fist to land on and it will push the water with more force out of the pipes! Lets get the tennis balls as high as the tower!
Old Mc Donald had a farm/ you can’t always get what you want/
The ground inside the pit appears to be making itself more solid. Or sand was removed idk
Bonus points for the sign in the background of the jetski getting wrecked!
As funny as “Science With Gaunson” is, he’s not 100% wrong lol. The drastic pressure change would crush the barrel as all that water leaves quickly

You Can't Always Get What You Want
I thought Big Macy would work
No it's the force of it driving so deep and the water mushroom vapor
Bare necessities- a classic :)
You’re actually for the most part right gaunson, what’s more than likely happening is called cavitation. In layman’s terms, Bruce pushed the water out of the way so fast and so hard. That the water in the drum before him. Didn’t have enough time to get out of the way. So when the air slammed into it. It forced the water back down. Causing it to implode.
The suction on the barrel was fantastic.
Thank goodness I can fast forward to the 5 seconds I actually want to see.
Old macdonald and bear necessities
Mobius could of used that jet ski 😢
We revisited some favs today with Brucie and the ax, can we get the giant dart again? It’s an oldie but goodie 😜
The "whole foods" clip 😅 Was that second flash of it a mistake?
The barrel collapsed because of the Bernoulli's principle. In fluid dynamics, Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in static pressure or a decrease in the fluid's potential energy.  As the water came out of the barrel, the pressure inside the barrel dropped significantly, The pressure outside the barrel remained statically higher.  As a result the barrel crushed from the outside from high air pressure.
That spiked ball should have been named bowser. Bowser's revenge :)
Why’d you guys feel the need bring Rexy to a public hospital? Why didn’t you just go & find someone who could sew him back together?
Was this filmed before or after the fascist takeover and lock down in Australia?
Why is 44 a new joke for you guys? I totally remember where it came from, but like, what makes it funny?
The barrel swished in because it pushed down the the bottom so hard the material pushing down started pulling from the sides above it pulling it in
Please
Bro rename it sonic
Use drone camera

it’s cavitation
But when guessing between 0-5 really can only guess 1-4
Eieio
Old micdoulnold
The Barrel crunched together because of the pressure difference between the air on the outside and the rushing water on the inside. When liquids move very fast, they have extremely low pressure on the side, and that creates a vacuum wave that crushes the barrel walls.  Scott was actually shockingly close with his explanation there
The  fist forcing the water out created a suction that made the barrel collapse? That is probably the coolest science thing I've ever seen
Jack has corridor digital merchandise on
Honestly if you are not watching every video to the end! What are you doing with your life! Who hurt you? Don’t think I’ve ever not watched a video to the end!

Looked like you created a vacuum for sure, and I think adding the side piping helped a lot with that. Created so much pressure that you pushed out all the air in the drum and the atmosphere was just like, got emmmm.
Brucie displaced so much water it created a vacuum inside the drum and the air pressure outside the drum crushed it

The shovel video is a classic!
Hang in there guys, I know you Aussies are under some tough times (understatement of the decade) right now.
Spike Geronimo Tyson versus a solid granite block that’s 1x1x1 meters and painted on all sides to match a grass block from Minecraft. Then include any small fragments in an order of merchandise that relates to the 44 Club. Does that sound good?  I like it!
U know how u say smash the like button why not actually smash the like button
Encase the drum in concrete then drop the ball!!

I'd thought the spike might of broken off but I was surprised it broke every single one of them. Can't wait to what else it can break such as a car
Out of 5 I give this episode a 6
Suggeztion: team up with spacex and drop stuff from space onto trampolines and your usual targets. 😎🚀
VIDEO STARTS AT 11:43
You need to make a metal grate, like the kind of thing you use to make French fries or dice onions and then drop stuff onto it, slicing it into nice cubes
Drop idea: Giant screw that spins stupid fast right before the drop.
Lads I can’t keep saying this with out any recognition, you need to make a big sharp grid shaped implement that dices things up when you drop things on it like the bloke in resident evil film, also guide wires so u never miss again
Ol McDonald had a farm
you guys should turn that concrete slowmo into your intro!!!!  reverse the footage and boom, #44 on the stack!!!!
That shot of the 44 exploding needs to be a shirt!!!!!!
How ridiculous vs line X coated objects......💯💯💯
As big a disappointment that first jetski was, the bigger was the perfect satisfaction of that concrete stack! Especially with the Phantom! Awesome stuff!!!
@jasonfromwork
You should make an entire to-scale Hulk.
Hi
Skip to 15:10 for the slow motion footage
vacuum yes, but completely the other way around... All the water shoots up so violently and simultaneously that the entire opening of the barrel is sealed by the water as the water goes up, leaving a vacuum at the bottom. It's perfectly clear on the slow-mo: water goes up and once it's almost all out, the barrel collapses... A shame that you dropped the tennis balls straight onto the water. They would shoot MUCH higher if you leave a pocket of air in between (because like you correctly say: you can't compress water, but you CAN compress air, and with the mass of the water coming up, you'd create an elastic pressure that would shoot your balls easily over the tower...
"You can't always get what you want"
Why was KFC in the video towards the end? I heard smash the like "bucket" lol

Still waiting for Stanford to finish the milk story 😂
2:45 what’s the positive news Stanford?
It’s too bad you don’t have more videos like the shovel one that was an absolute riot of a laugh 😂😂😂😂 please make more like it?
Of course you can compress water. Stop saying you can't!
Watching your videos almost makes me forget about the police state and total tyranny going on in Australia. No masks or distancing, no police writing tickets or tackling peaceful people, no rubber bullets or tear gas. That the police aren't beating you with clubs is almost as amazing as the content!

2:50 you can compress water if you compress it enough it will turn into ice it will still be warm but it will turn into ice
They should drop stuff onto a spinning blade
14:00 Why is there a restaurant ad ?
It’s so cool
You guys should get a force sensor of some kind so you can see how hard stuff hits. More Science with Gaunson
5.30 i think it just hit the bottom. that's why
Just wanted to say goodbye and good luck with everything.  With YouTube's recent policy changes I can't in good conscience support YouTube in any way, shape, or form anymore.  Thanks for all the great videos over the years.  I hope to see you guys on a different platform in the future. One that supports everyone's views and opinions. May God bless you all.
You should put rexy on top of it when you drop it into water so he shoots super high out of the top
I thought Alitalia Australia was on complete lock down?
So the ball prolly would have went through move pavers if not for the pallet 😜
The water got pushed out and the air could not get in because the water was on top creating a void under the water almost vacuumed seeling the drum
The song titles were... Old McDonald, You Can't Always Get What You Want, What You Know, and The Bear Necessities (Jungle Book.)
How about you try to smash some real concrete with the wrecking ball? The sand absorbs a lot of the force. I would love to see how much damage this thing would cause on a normal road.
Ole McDonald had a farm is the song
old mcdonald had a farm, well you can't always get what you want, shut up and dance with me,bear necessities.

U suck at whistling Stan
This channels quality of content has dropped off a cliff (tower). It’s just repetitive content at different frame rates. Same video ideas for the last 3 years.

You can compress water, but it takes some crazy pressure to do that. Like several millions of atmospheric pressures. If water did not compress at lest a little, the oceans level would be about 1m higher.
14:06 Yes?
yeah, boooy
Can you place one of your moms under it? My mom is rn in Japannnn
You can compress water, the volume change is tiny across very very large pressure differences
You guys should freeze the slow motion frames and sell as a picture
Old McDonald had a farm
Nigel and barrels again with exhausts, but place a 1 inch ply disk, slightly smaller in diameter of the barrel opening. Should create a plunger effect, giving much more power to eject tennis balls.
Do the water filled barrel thing again, with Bruce, but put a piece of plywood, cut to fit snugly in the barrel, on top of the water. The tennis balls will go a lot higher.
Old mac Donald has a farm eyayayy eyayaa yooo.. I think
you know... Gaunson has been slacking in telling ua to get the bell on
Old Macdonald had a farm
Looks like the Spiny Eggs on Super Mario Bros..
Idea for ya just like how you put pipes on the sides of the barrel do that same thing but make the pipes bigger like the diameter of the pipes when combined equals to the diameter of the barrel that way water wont come out the middle hopefully, should be interesting.
Looks like  the wood palette absorb some of the impact.
You cheated with the pavers. Bruce was on flat sand, spike ball was on a pallet which wasn't supporting the pavers very well, especially with the wood directly under the middle.
Best name ever
Put a running car under spikey ball and drop it on the running engine no hood just straight on the engine

So me just being honest I have no idea what the first song was I feel like it was a nursery rhyme but otherwise I have no idea it's bad😆😆😆
The shovel video is what made me watch you guys
You should try to hulk hands do a bro fist
Hi
Y'all need to get a ball that's a perfect fit for the barrel to really send some tennies flying
SHOVELS!!! Aww, look at the little baby faces!
"1000lbs spike ball vs 1000 spike balls" Or  "1000 lbs spike ball vs 100 spike ball trampolines"
Not even close to slo mo guys
This is the idea.  Patreon or pay per view episodes Get some skeletons, with that ballistic body stuff and drop Bruce and Spike on it….  Go!
Good video lads
Do a barrel like the the first one with tennis balls but empty with a lid on it. Maybe the compressed air from the barrel crushing will launch the balls higher?
What’s the deal with the KFC flash on the screen at 14.2 ?
Gaunson is almost right - the water is evacuated so quickly from the barrel, it leaves a vacuum between the column of water and the bottom of the barrel. The column of water also stops air filling the void, thus the vacuum. Then it's just air pressure compressing the barrel from the outside in that causes it to collapse. Pretty cool stuff!
Animals at the farm?

Stanford whistled: 1. Old MacDonald 2. You can't always get what you want 3. I don't care, I love it 4. Bare Necessities
The song is “Zacchaeus was a wee little man” “You can’t always get what you want” “I don’t care, I love it” “Bear necessities”
Love the vid as usual fellas, but one suggestion, instead of putting the stack on top of a pallet using something like a steal plate? Might be a stretch but maybe the force of impact caused the center support of pallet causes the last pavers to break.#retestspiketyson
WATER IS COMPRESSIBLE! like any other matter... look it up
The spray sounds exactly like the spiders of Minecraft 😂
The wood pallet absorbed some of the shock. I bet a steel plate would have allowed for complete obliteration.
Hi

You gotta be careful with that whistling, that almost hit a Content ID match, so close to the original it was.
I do love the culture delay in Australia. Definitely no one their age in the US knows who Jenny Craig is.

whats up with everyones teeth?! wtf
drum crushed like a can bc the fist hit the bottom so hard
i want to see the barrles in that style again accept they load in the exsauhst tubes a gopro in each tube for launching also they should do anothere concreat vid where they alternate the painted color of each slab  so then in theroy  it would kinda result in a rainbow  explosion of debris
How Good!
Bear necessities, jungle book!
with the jet ski i have a head cannon that the spike ball made that happen threw sheer will power

Is there a way you could make a big artificial heart valve and mount it to the top of the barrel? You're losing all the potential pressure out the top
9:44 Gaunson literally called out Spongebob  9:51 then he said he did that
"Old McDonald had a farm" "You can't always get what you want." "I don't care, I love it" "Bear Necessities"
Bingo was he's namo
For the amount of pressure created for the 2nd barrel, probably should've had cone-shaped pipes attached fat side inwards so that it would jet harder  Also, you guys should do a bed of spikes to drop stuff onto

Will we ever see the end of original rexy ? And will it be by "accident" or just a full on meteor like strike on his head.
As a Piranha Plant main in super smash bros, I approve the spike ball. 👌🏻
what i would love to see is you guys get a parachute for rexy and strap a go pro to his chest and drop him with stuff separately or next time you go to the really high places dam, heli, cliff etc and drop him off an let him float down lol
Oh McDonald

While the other half of their country turns into a ball a burning dog shit. They still drop stuff from a tower onto other stuff on the ground and get paid for it. With all the internet power your guys have( about 1/4 of the Australian population subscribed to you) why don't you guys do something about the tyranny that is happening in your backyard?

Do a compatition between all the big boy drop items to determin whats the ultimate smasher
Not gonna lie, considering Gaunson called for the guess, I think 6 was a totally legitimate option for Stanford...lol
Bingo
I reckon spike would have made it much further if the slabs weren't on the pallet.  There was a lot of energy absorbed from that and the sand below.
jacks voice is so attractive i need a compilation of every time jack has said something in a video
Drop a motorcycle on the ax! Or hit it with the spike ball.  All the exposed mechanisms will look really cool
13:33 starts the bare necessities song in the jungle book?
the first one could of been marry had a little or old make donald
You should drop the Giant dart through the jet ski while it’s standing upright
With the barrels full of water you should have put a big piece of wood or foam floating on top so when the fist hit it acted like a big plunger
Science with Gaunson is on Point here. The scientific phenomenon is called cavitation, same thing that makes the bottoms of full glass bottles break when you hit the top.
You should drop spike Tyson on the axe

5:20 can some plz just make a compilation of all the “science with Ganson” moments? Please 😂
Like how they just stand around while the other ppl stack heavy pavers
The third song sounded like eye of the tiger
Welcome to the 44 chaps!
Here is an idea. Try a solid block of concrete about the size and shape of the pavers and drop spike tyson on it. Make two blocks of concrete one for bruise and one for spike

The barrels needed a thick circular floating plate like ontop of the liquid so that when Bruce hits the plate the plate will force most of the liquid through the pipes and minimize energy loss to liquid flying back out the top of the barrel.

stanford guessing 6 for in between 0 and 5 was funny but herron would have also got it wrong, since the only numbers to guess are 1,2,3 and 4

If the water leaves but no air can get into the barrel. The only thing left for the barrel to do is be sucked into where the water once was. The barrel isn't strong enough to withstand the vacumme created by the water leaving in such a synchronous way.
I choose to believe the water jet idea was directly inspired by the comment i left suggesting it a few weeks ago
old mc Donald had a farm
I reckon it would work better if you dont fill the barrels to the top, but more like half way?
In the toy story universe these guys are seen as horrific war criminals

Love the science with Spiky - shows the effectiveness of kinetic energy.
Refer to the ball as "Sargeant" for SGT - Spike Geronimo Tyson. Like if u agree👍
Give Brucey some spiked knucks
Old McDonald
Satisfying cut on the jet ski. Satisfying cut of a man is our Gaunson 😂❤️ #Mancrush
4:57: My guess is the fist went through the water causing low pressure behind it (like an airplane wing), then the water reflected off and up the sides of the bucket sealing off the air from the outside. Normally air would rush inwards as the water rushed outwards to fill the space that the water was before. but now the only way that the whole system could equalise pressure was to bring the sides of the barrel together.
If you can't get Brucey out, as long as you can hook it up, just lift Brucey with the whole barrell and drop it together so Brucey punches through.
Cheetos licking fingers 3:11
I think a nice addition to their arsenal of dropable items would be a 444 kg giant dart. Punch some serious holes in things.
You should do the bricks again but layer in between paint cans so you get a cool color change as each brick or two breaks!!!

You should show some of the phantom shots on rewind. Watching that go from a dust cloud to blocks to the spray painted 44 would be sick.
do a drop on a seesaw
You guys should try to drop Bruce on an air pump and launch a rocket back to the top of the tower, ab bit like these kids toys 😃  https://youtu.be/CSN7_qq6s7Y
You was whistling the farm song I don’t know the name of it
The song is Old McDonald
I don't think it was  vacuum. I think it happened something similar to the time you dropped the massive wreking ball into the water tank, and the tank came back up bouncing with the ball. That was due to viscous interaction between ball-water being transfered as viscous interaction between water-tank. That made the ball drag with it the rest of the system wen bouncing back up.   Same thing happened this time. However the metal bucked did not have the structural rigidity to sustain the viscous pull from water. Plus the fist did not bounce at all, it just stuck to the bottom. So the water coming back up basically sucked the interal walls of the bucket, making it collapse into itself  Imagine trowing you hand into a bowl full of corn syrup and pulling it up very quickly: the bowl probabily comes back up with your hand, for a brief moment, since the bowl is also somewhat bouncing due to your push into whater, that than pushed down the bowl. But if the bowl is made out of paper (? like syrup proof paper, i dunno ?) when you punch down maybe the bowl can whitstand pushing strain, but then you pull up and the bowl cannot whithstand sucking, and it collapse.   (not sure about this, i just made a guess)
I'll be so happy when the open mouth thumbnails are a thing of the past.
pick a number BETWEEN 0 and 5 so only 1, 2, 3 or 4. So 5 and 6 are both wrong. Great job.
Old Mac Donald 6:03
Science with Gaunson
Try only filling the barrels half way
Lmao at least the paint survived that to bad no one painted that to be the last standing
Old McGaunson had a farm. Brett can't always get what he wants. I don't care. I love Herron. The bear ridiculous.
Should’ve painted the wrecking ball gold
Cavitation
With the barrels, I'd like like see some foam or something similar at the top. So it pushes the water down when you drop hulk
The can collapsed because the force of the water exiting created a vacuum strong enough to suck the sides in. The vacuum's pressure exceeded the maximum structural integrity of the can. (in v6 cans case, that was all positive pressure blowing everything out)
number BETWEEN 0 and 5 is 1,2,3 and 4. So both of you didn't guess correctly.
I guess its the 4 songs that everyone else are commenting that are the same do I win the pin 😊🥳🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 oh and it’s my birthday tomorrow

Eh... pick a number between 0 and 5? 5 is just as bad as an answer 🤔🤣😂
Am I the only one who wants them to add a removable wolverine claw attachment to Bruce?
Cavitation on science with Guanson!
Can you strap Ruth Lee to fireworks and launch him, is it possible? Love your videos.
Comment: Old McDonald's out of tune, Eb, G, E, A#, O. Oh, and I have no idea about the others, probably because they were murdered too.
Oh McDonald had a farm
I'm sure someone has commented this, the vacuum that collapsed the barrel is cause by the water leaving up through the drum
Old McDonald had a farm / You can't always get what you want. / I don't care, I love it / Bear Necessities
You guys need to appreciate that giant green fist on your channel page. Anyone else think they should have a Bruce banner?
Bottom got punched out that's why the sides collapsed.  Twinkle twinkle little star first song
LEROY!!!....Cmon at least Leroy subverted expectations. This was more like kool-aid man
Have to say the shovel video is the best and the funniest video on your channel and on YouTube itself. You guys are the best keep going and making awsome videos that puts smiles on people's faces.
I could easily search for this but I'd like to ask fans that are more consistent than I am. Did their gaming channel ever take off and do they still make content for it?
05:56 "Old McDonald had an injured T-Rex, and brought him to the E-I-ER-O." 09:31 "You can't always get what you want unless you're really good at complaining" 11:22 "I don't care, I love it, I dropped my car from a 44-meter tower onto a giant ax." 13:27 "The Bear Necessities of Life is facing the Right and Wrong direction of the toilet paper roll and doing something about it."  I crack myself up... :)
And on that farm he had a slave e i e i o
KFC twice.
You lads have no idea how much I want to go to the tower and pull up all those weeds in the sand lmao
If you made the cans into pistons by adding a top that sits on the water like a thick  piece of metal that is being held up by some perforation pieces than when the fist hits it would break the perforations and than drive the top down pushing out the water or maybe something simpler like a big ball that fits perfectly that is strong enough to push the water without being popped.
Jack rocking that Corridor hoodie

Do the stack again but saran wrap the stack.
3:30 Raining Blood!!!!!
They should make a trebuchet to launch the spike ball at a building that's going to be demolished
Better get Shazam ready for the commtest
Hey that is not fair you pinned yourself lol
The accelerated water that shot out from both pipes dragged the water that was still in the barrel with it and because Brucey blocked the water from shooting out through the barrel opening a vacuum was created in the barrel and that sucked the barrel walls inwards. That would be my explanation.
Yes      #fortyfourgang
i'm gonna guess that song was old macdonald but incredibly off key.
I from Brazil
the song you whistled was "old town road" by lil nas x
Old McDonald (with out of key whistling ) LOL
Old McDonald kind sir
Old McDonald
I would had called it Bowser
I think you should make a massive concrete block at the base of the tower and put everything up against it until it’s completely shattered
You guys should drop giant neodymium magnets on each other (: like GIANT ones
Finally a wrecking ball fit for Miley Cyrus! 😁
Would be awesome to see what your collection of toys do to a full body ballistic gel human. For science of course.
Stanford. Ur terrible. Im not even gona guess LOLZ!!!!!!
Who flipping cares about the names of the songs, we should just appreciate the quality of Stanford's whistling.
Why does he have a farm
Old MacDonald Had a Farm
What's the name of the song when they drop the atlas into the rainbow barrel? Anybody know?
The implosion of the first barrel was quite nice to see in the slomo.
Is contest the 1st song with Yankee-doodle
old Mac Donald
Jack should work in a radio with his voice :D
That was a terrible Old McDoanld bro... well off key
Another fun video. Any chance we can get a behind the scenes video? Or maybe there already is one and I missed it? Been watching for the last six to twelve months. I'd love to see how some of the videos are made, as well as how you get access to some of the locations.
Omg if you took a still shot of those tennis balls on water, I’d buy that!
How ridiculous is it that these guys still think they are doing the same thing but better when really they are just selling swag to 8 year olds
You guys need some spades to dig holes not square head ones🤣 much love from USA

Can you guys make something heavy to drop with a concave/hollow bottom face? I want to see what happens when the force is channeled to the center of the dropped item
Bare necessities and I love it!

Old mc donald had a farm eieioooooo
Spiked ball vs giant Axe head do it!
Did he say 44 gallon drum?...gallon, that's an American unit of measurement
Bruce yes! Fist bump!!!!
Love you guys! 44 ‘s my honeysuckle....lol
It collapsed because it smacked the bottom of the barrel. Slow motion was awesome
Old McDonald is the song?
Great vid lads. Is there a compilation video of rexie hits?… or should there be one? Who’s thinks so?
"You have my spike ball" "And my jet ski" "And my axe"  We no longer have the jet ski. Thanks, Gimli.
Just so everyone knows you can compress water I am not sure what they are talking about hahah
At 14.01 I suddenly felt like KFC and I don't know why??????? As I had just eaten a pot noodle.   N.B Other fatty, greasy, salty take away food are available. Also Rexy should be wearing a hard hat.
bingo?
Missed a huge opportunity to call it Sonic....

you guys need to keep your experiments consistent the hulk fist didn't have a pallet under the pavers a pallet has give in it especially when there is a bunch of weight on it i bet the hulk fist would have cracked them all if they were on a pallet as well!
Good to see a corridor crew sweater!

Stanford easy way to avoid the wind make a wind shield off the railing on the outer side with a tarp and zip ties
If anyone actually knows the science behind the barrel bending, let me know! I thought it would have had to with the bottom being pushed down so the sides collapsed but the bottom didn't really get bent
444 KG, nice.
You need longer pipes on your barrel. Once the tennis ball left the pipe the water kept moving faster than the tennis ball and pushed it off to the side killing yer tennis balls speed. If you made that pipe about 3 feet longer I bet it would shoot it clear over the tower
is there some reason you guys haven't put some kind of cover on the top floor yet? windbreak? heated tent? I can't imagine anyone uses that tower more than you guys but I'm sure not a single one would hate it...
Old McDonald and I caught the bearneccesities from jungle book I forgot you don't always get wat you want.
Is it just me or does every count down they do line up with YouTube ads
8:27 - 8:45 and a partridge in a pear treee
Neither 6 or 5 are numbers between 0 and 5.
WHY ARE YOU GUYS NOT REVERSING ⏪⏪IT😳😳😳
Nerd Alert: Pretty sure surface area is just as important as mass when it comes to penetration. If you had something that was half the weight, say 225kg, but was shaped like a bullet or pen, I think it would go deeper into the concrete.
I thought Stanford was being cute: turns out, he had a massive brain fart.
Anyone else skip to the 30seconds of content then leave?

13:40. I like food cause it is yummy, i will put it in my tummy, we can have all the rice, all you have to do is go! Go! Grab a bowl
Spike ball is my new favorite thing on this channel
I'd say the barrel collapsed in due to the fist hitting the bottom and creating a vaccum as you suggested. Having the water get pushed out the top by the fist, but then the fist had to pull something down when it hit the bottom, something had to fill the vaccum. The water was already going up, so the sides gave in to the vaccum.
Nice video and very informative and very entertaining and very satisfaction more videos.  11:15 🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏.
👍
Bear necessedies (spelling)
You guys should do body gel
Way out of tune though!
I thought of a great name for it.. unfortunately I’m a bit late to that party though. What about Ankyla because of an ankylosaurus’ tail being spiked like a mace.
You can compres water, its called Ice😂
his innitials are sgt. sargent could be a nickname
Can you drop spike Tyson on some pur foam cans? Hopefully they explode and the foam will expand whilst flying through the air!
O'll McDonald's had a farm, eyeyoooo

The axe blade took some damage it you didn't notice
8:47:  It's interesting that they still call it Kentucky Fried Chicken on your side of the world.  In the states, they've called it "KFC" for over thirty years, presumably to free us from the responsibility of knowing that the "F" stands for "Fried."
Lol showing the past clips of the toy being rushed to the hospital then once again rexy meets the giant axe again lol🤣🤣❤
Old McDonald, dude. Too easy
Can't lie the random word yelling is so annoying
old McDonald had a farm So what p!nk i love it  Bear Necessities
old maccas had a big ol' field the rolling atlas stones - you can probably get what you want (to be honest) the kfc ad - icona pop large mammal necessities - phil collins
I have a suggestion for your efforts to launch the tennis balls. I think that if you cut a disc that just barely fits the inside of the drum so that when the fist hits it it pushes down initially kind of like a plunger inside of a medicine syringe. Obviously the disc would need to be made out of something that can float but yet can still take a decent impact. Either that or you can weld tiny little pins on the inside of the drum and set the disk on top of those pins obviously the force of that fist is going to break a tiny little pin and it would also do the same thing as if it was floating on top of the water. Then no doubt you're going to get some more lift on those tennis balls even though the fist is going to destroy the disc no matter what. Just a thought. If you use like a slide hammer spot-weld or something like that then you could initially just cut the top of the drum out and use the lid for the drum because it's going to fit down inside of there
You could make wallpapers out of there slow mo shots
To get the Hulk Fist out……. Just drop it again. The fist will pound through the bottom ( insert “Mom” joke here).
stanford do not look as energitic as before... btw u guys are the best triplets

YOU HAVE TO DO HOW MANY DOORS WITH SPIKE
You should drop something on a table of upward facing razor blades in rows and slice things
6. That was priceless.
Y'all should bury the drums in the sand so they don't rip and the water can be forced out the tubes with more force
Bank safe part 2 vs spike Tyson
Have you ever dropped something, and caught it from the tower after the bounce?
science with me! the barrel imploded, because when brucey slamed down in the barrel, all the water escaped, but no air was coming in because of the huge amount of water and brucey, blocking the air from entering causing nothing to be a substitute for the water to keep the barrels shape.  and thus concludes, science with me.
old mcdonald had a farm
Bruce, Maxwell and spike ball How Good! You guys should do a glow in the dark series, basketball tic tack toe from the tower!
jet ski what i don't see one ..44 club
I love these 3 but I think I've mentioned something similar the real star is editor Jack. His skills are nuts but to all involved keep it up.
Old Mick Donald, ?, ?, ?,
Lion king cartoon
The slowy are the best footage.
Try 3 giant axe heads next to each other to get 3 cuts 🤷‍♂️
It’s the fact there is no air at the bottom. when the fist punches through and shoots all the water out, it creates a vacuum at the bottom of the can strong enough to suck the can in on itself
Yeet
I wonder how well Stanford knows those songs… 🤪

Can I just say that the phrase "sexy clap" will probably come back to haunt Derek.  If you don't know what I mean, just sit and think about it for a bit. It'll come to you.  PS: I don't care what anyone says, I'm only ever referring to the giant spike ball as Lakitu. The resemblance and similarity of action is too uncanny.
You guys need a mega dart, full of lead, and with a tungsten tip!! The thing world be lethal😂👍🏽🔥
The water was pushed out faster than air could fill in its place, causing the barrel to cave in on itself
You guys should get 1 more phantom for 1 more angle because you never know where it’s going to hit. But I love the vid!
Name it “Darth Ball”!! Especially with the new paint job!!!
Old McDonald Can't always get what you want What You Know Bear Necessities
ok so the pressure of Bruce hitting the water created high pressure and as the water escapes past Bruce it created a low pressure zone resulting in the implosion of the barrel. regards Prof Julius Sumner-Miller.

A mobile game for this kind of stuff would be fun
#freebruce
I want a tungsten dart. Or some kind of heavy dart. The level of destruction would be incredible
Who would come out on top? Bruce or Geronimo? Could be another great video in the making. And there was definitely the bear necessities up top. Stay safe. And be excellent 🤙🤙🤙

I'm disappointed you didn't just drop Bruce again to try get him out or drop spike Tyson onto Bruce struck in a can, that would have been a great vid!
How does that camera fall with it but stay locked on?
Bro you are video I very very very expensiv so good video 😘
I skipped and legit watched 2 to 3 mins of actual content..
Watching the pallet at the end move was amazing.

Custom pipe and barrel episode with… a ball that almost fits the hole perfectly would absolutely send the water 💦
15:13 - removing the lid of a spray paint can with only a 444 kilo mace.
Phantom camera plus the .25x playback speed is insane
Have they ever dropped onto a claw machine? One of those arcade games filled with stuffed animals? Fill it with toys, toss in Rexy for good measure, and bet on how many snuggle buddies will survive.
You guys should try spike tyson vs giant axe
I would have dropped the fist with it being stuck... I mean I don't see what's wrong with that

Didn't think of it until now, spike ball should've been named Bowser.
6:03 old mcdonald
Shoulda named the ball Spike Lee
HR I have 2 suggestions! You should've filled the barrels with water and then sealed the top. More energy with be transfered to the pipes. And the other suggestion is to drop brucy on a barrel on oobleck.
These guys are awsome
Probably not the most culturally sensitive or appropriate thing to do naming an implement of  destruction after a historically significant person from a culture that you have no part of or heritage to and which has been exploited by white western civilisation. So maybe give it a different name that is culturally appropriate rather than Geronimo? Call it the drop bear. They are murderous spiky boys of doom :P
Bear necessity
Stanford whitsled old Macdonald
If you didn't have those pavers on a wooden pallet, that thing would have obliterated all of them right down to the base. You can see where it flexes and takes some of the energy from the impact away. The sand probably took some, too.
Call the ball BOWSER??
It creates a vacuum which then makes the barrel collapse in on its self.
All right what happened when it stretched the bottom out and deform the bottom ring stretching it sucking deciding to compensate
This episode is probably why you need that guy standing by with emergency extraction machinery

Ever thought about putting a tarp down to make clean-up easier?
Hey How Ridiculous y'all should make and drop a giant anchor

Old mc Donald that’s got to be it
We ever going to see Thor vs one of those carnival games where you hit a seesaw and launch a weight up to a bell?
Mike Tyson and Geronimo? Two names? So dumb.  Iron Spike Tyson is plenty of name for one object.    Gerónimo doesnt even make sense... everything they have ever dropped could have been called Gerónimo.
If you guys put a circle plunger of some sort on top of the water in the barrels the tennis balls might have went way higher
Editor Jack is the coolest man alive.
One word to answer why the barrel crushed: suction
Can we see what the spiked ball does to a ballistics dummy?
Gaunson the barrel would have collapsed as the base of it was pushed into the ground so the sides were pull with it.
Jenny Craig, vacuum, I mean they both suck so their pretty much the same thing.
BRING GIANT DART BACKKK
The pallet absorbed a decent amount of energy.  It would have easily shattered all of them if the stack was flat on the ground/concrete

Giant Shrek sculpture vs lord Farquaad from 45 meters
I need you to explain that again in words please, because my mind is saying that cause when it hit the bottom of the bottom of the barrel it created a vacuum which sucked the sides in cause in order for the bottom of the barrel to extend downward it has to pull more matter from elsewhere in the barrel so in turn causes the sides to collapse!? I think what you said is pretty much the same thing but my mind makes me run a half marathon instead of only the 5k I needed to run to get to the same finish line.. lol! What a banger of a vid tho boys keep em coming. You guys should hit up Ozzyman Reviews and have him come do a vid together, I know he's located in Perth also! Cheers.
Scott said “im guessing a number 0-5” I’m guessing he was going to send who was closer to the top. He never said pick a number 1-5 so therefore Stanford wasn’t wrong, right? Therefore he shouldn’t have gone to the top because he couldn’t have been close the the number since 5 was already chosen
🎶Old McDonald had a farm 🎶
Hate to pop you science bubble, but it wasn't a vacume that caused the caving in of the barrel. The steel was too thick for that to be the case. No, the barrel caved in because of the pressure created at the bottom, which folded the sides up. The circumfrece of the bottom of the barrel shrank because of it being caved in, which forced the sides of the barrel to follow suite. Their momentum did the rest.
Have they ever said how high each level of the tower is?
1.Old McDonald had a farm  2. You can’t always get what you want
You needed the pipes to be higher than the top of the Barrell. That would have helped keep the water coming out around the fist. And a little less water in them to begin with.  13:31 Bear Necessities - Jungle Book
Spike Tyson should be called Bowser now with the paint colors lol
You guys gotta team with Mark Rober and figure out how to get maximum pressure through those pipes on the side of the barrel.
Ok, but technically you CAN compress water...it's just really really hard to do. But the reason the water goes so high when you have a normal barrel is because of it's compression. It doesn't get compressed much, but enough to release massive amounts of energy.
I'd hate to be the ones who clean up after these guys.
My favourite part is always “Science with Gaunson!” 🤓👍✨

the effect of the drum sucking in as i believe called an implosion
5:27 no water is also impossible to decompress the reason is inertia causeing a vacuum to collopse the barral
How good would it be if with every drop you had a merch item that was involved and then auctioned off. Those would be unique items indeed.

WHY NO 4K you guys are the 44 club we need 4k video plz thank you
Stanford, I think your whistle is broken.

I'm actually surprised that a portion of concrete survived, I thought the wrecking ball would crush it all together.
you need to make shirts with a Rexy/Super Dave Osborne (look him up) combo...Always optimistic...always destroyed.
I got it. Is it old McDonald had some land ow ey ow ey ow?
Ok I gotta ask and have been curious for awhile, do you guys own the tower or not, and I love the vids so much
We should just appreciate the fact that these guys are even allowed to make content right now while Australia is under a tyrannical take over. First they took the guns now they're taking your freedom
The ball named Sue. Does it need to be a men's name. The shovel video is #1 and Rexy to the emergency was up on the list. Loved todays video!
So you guys must be in West Australia? I'm assuming this because West Australia seems to be ok while East Australia has gone full Nazi Germany
why dont yall build a small metal wind break up there about 3 foot high.
I have not started Bitcoin yet but heard it wasn't good,leads to hacking and issues with charged billing...

It is a Barra Barrel with that v6 action!
Legends of wreckage
Next big metal object needs to be just one giant spike. Shaped like the little ones on the ball. Just...huge. and singular. Edit: fun fact water actually IS compressible but the amount it compresses over such a massive volume of water is practically negligible. So they just say its uncompressable. But yeah it is possible and when it happens you start getting wierd things like ice-7 (but that cant happen on earth naturally) Science!
Sometimes content is ehhhh but sometimes content is Great. Most times content is great. Blob videos not so good, smash  videos YES!!!..
"that'd be quite good if you hated him, but you don't" Why did that sound like a reminder. xD  Poor  Scott
Old McDonald had a farm
Why the barrel crunched around the hulk fist is because it created a vacuum.  when the hulk fist smashes down, it displaces the water underneath it, sending it out through the tubes (and moreso the top since it's a wider apperture closer to the blast), but the water is covering the entire circumference of the barrel's openings, so if the water is going up, what's in the barrel now?  The answer is a vacuum, which the barrel isn't graded to withstand, causing the sides of the barrel to cave from the pressure hugging the hulk fist like a big metal glove.
Would you ever make a 3D scan of rexy so people can print their own???
do you guys think there's a way to rig up something that, when they drop a heavy object off the tower, it lands on a sort of air pump and they use it to see how much air they can fill into a balloon with a single drop, and seeing if progressively heavier objects inflates the balloon more?

You need a welder to make a proper vessel with the right wall thickness to ensure it can take the force of Bruce and Geronimo. Mufflers and flimsy oil drums aren't gonna cut it gentlemen.
They better be building a bigger tower, just for the company’s sake
Love your channel. That is all.
you need to have spike tyson vs Tungsten Cube must see or the hulk fist vs Spike Tyson
Spike-Lee !😀
Rexy runs the show he just allows y’all to drop things with him involved.
they should start dropping things from 44 meters, instead of 45   Get it?
Momo here momo there Iyar oh
You should get the guys that made Bruce and Spike Tyson to make a super thick/ strong barrel to see if anything different happens or if it can survive the vacuum. You should also try putting different things in the barrel eg jelly
loved it!
The drops are so cool and yet its the most exciting thing I ever see and just seeing the things they drop is thing you wouldn't of thing of seeing being drop of smashing 😎
the spike ball hits with about 200000 Joules of energy (tnt is 4000 joules so 500 pieces of tnt worth of energy apon hitting the ground)
You should get a tytainiam barrel and use it doing the same thing
gopro cam in tennis ball.
Aye no way!!!!! I called Spike Tyson first. Look it up. The first video you asked for a name. I jumped on it.
The whistle was "Yankee doodle"

old macdonald had a farm
Looked like ol Brucey got vacuumed in by the water release and when it broke the bottom the air pressure shifted
1st one is Mary had a little lam
when are you ganna drop the axe on things and not things on the axe
We need a TUNGSTEN spiked wrecking ball!!!
best day  of my life
Gaunson is actually not that dumb
Update for science with Gaunson: the water leaving quickly created a low pressure zone like a venturi.
Love the vids, boys! You should make a BobBomb for Mario Bros and drop that next!!!

How Ridiculous is this video
I think it would actually look really cool to have a 44 rexy shirt like that painted on the back.
Yooo editor jack with the corridor digital merch!!
Ya boy whistled Ol’ McDonald
I swear Gaunsen said he ate “Honey sewer chicken” lmfao
Am I the only one thinking how cool it would be to see them drop a giant or super sized version of rexy
you should paint spike like bowsers shell for halloween

I’ve watched every second of every vidy I’m so glad to be apart of this great 44club!
I think it would be awesome if they got clear ballistics gel and dropped it on the giant axe or drop the spike ball/bruce/the giant dart and the giant sword on it 🤔
you know you’ve fail when somethings in working condition after a drop
1st old MC Donald  2nd can't always get what you want  3rd never gonna give you up  4th bare necessities

6:39 you can actually see the rainbow formed in the mist XD
Ok 1 is old McDonald had a farm and 4 is bare necessities, use this info as you wish
Why the KFC flash @14:00 Seems like subliminal suggestion to me...now I  need some sweet southern fried chikens.
Is Scott hungover? 🤕 😂😂😂
Does ANYONE know the name to the song in the opening of this video? It’s awesome, I must have it
BARE NECESSITIES THAT'S ALL I'M GONNA SAY.
I’m in the 44 club
make a giant rexy balloon
Could name the ball "Points Blank"
Those barrels are really cool! If you built them again but put a steel piston in the middle that seals tighter against the barrel you could get an even better result. You could drop Bruce on the piston and all the energy will be transferred into those pipes and launch the tennis balls even higher. Looks like a good bit of energy lost back through the barrel. I think you guys could have a lot of fun with these barrels! You could also get some great slowmo shots!
Bingo
the winner of the mine games you guys to at the start should get merch with their face on it at the end of the year
Alright. The concept is there. So now. Reinforce a barrel and tubes. And add a plug/piston plate, On top to force the majority through the pipes.

Contest:  Got only one Song challenge bear necessities
8:10 I did that to him, but let’s do it again 😂
Bigger pipes in the barrel. The water can't get out fast enough.
He wistled old macdonald
You need to redo the Concrete Stack again. The way you have it set up. The Pallet they are on. Its possible that the bottom couple broke only cause of the 2x4 piece that runs across of it. So its impossible to tell if the Spiked Ball actually caused that Damage.
500 kilo giant dart?
"Old McDonald had a farm" "You can't always get what you want." "I don't care, I love it" "Bear Necessities"
Make a sequel shovel video or something similar
The force behind that water to create that vacuum must of been intense to collapse it that quick. Epic
Guys guys guys!!!!!!!!! READ THIS!! Cut out a piece of wood 6 inches thick and just a tiny bit smaller of a diameter.. and float it on top.. then drop the fist dead center!!
What cameras you all use the look really good
I liked the kfc sneak in subliminal message ... now i need biscuits

Jungle book, simple bear necessities
I just love how the barrel crumpled around the hulk fist after the water was like “c ya!”   But what is the science??? I legit think the void theory is right tho
Every time they drop something, an ad comes up
Just redrop the Bruce inside the barrel and let it punch out the bottom
I think it would have obliterated more pavers if the stack wasn’t on a wooden pallet (maybe a metal plate?), as it looks like it absorbed a bit of impact before stopping.
the person who actually got that spray painted shirt if you see this comment please say something here
The whistling: 1) Old MacDonald. 2) Bad Moon Rising. 3) A Song of Joy 4) The Bare Necessities

Ol Mackie d had some animals on a plot of dirt.
Second whistle bare necessities from jungle book movie.
Y’all should build a massive foam pit at the base of that tower and use that winch to pull you up. Attach a handle that you hold on to in order to make it a competition. Could even fill it with orbs
First whistle: Old MacDonald had a farm
Old Macdonald's farm was what it sounded like to me
Is the song old McDonald had a farm
Why?!?!?!...is there no Angry Birds stage featuring How Ridiculous?
One of them was bear nessesties
Please stop yelling random things while dropping.
Spikeball vs Newtonian fluid ultra slow-mo… please!
That's definitely the closest to correct Science with Gaunson has ever been
The 103 ways to use a shovel is 👌 💯 AMAZING!
Bear Necessities, but other than that, I have no clue.
ITS SCIENCE !!
The barrel was crushed by air pressure.  The velocity of the water being forced out of the barrel through both the top, and the tubes at the bottom, created a vacuum sufficient to allow the local air pressure to crush the barrel, because it can't get inside the barrel past the exiting water.  Normally when you do this type of drop, all the water MUST go out the top, and the forces balance out (or blow the barrel apart, instead).  In this case, the water had somewhere to go, and the force of the fist made it move quickly enough that nothing was left behind, but no air could get in yet. . Voila...CRUNCH!
Whistled Songs:   1. Old McDonald   2. You Can't Always Get What You Want  3. What You Want  4. Bare Necessities
I am 44!!!
Old MacDonald had a farm. E I E I O!
The first tune Stanford was whistling to was: ‘old MacDonald had a farm’.
14:05 nobody gonna talk about homeboy almost getting rocks to his face on the tower? Why was he standing there??
Old Rex Donald, Rex can't always get what he wants, 44club is the best (bloody heck #idk)  , and the Bare Rexcessities
I like how Scotty's BSing science explanation gag was actually not far off.
Old Mac Donald
The spike ball is such a stroke of genius 👏
Thumbs up, but only for the Jenny Craig science... lol
14:00 "smash that like bucket"?? Haha Someone is hungry lol
Old McDonald had, come undone, trying to figure out ..What you know about. The facts of life 44! 3.2.1. another one it is Gaunson
Me after the first one: OLD MCDONALD Me after the second one: Well theres always next commtest...
Not saying he can't whistle, just saying some of them could have been a little better....the wind definitely didn't help, tbf. Imo
14:00 Gaunson with the Foodian Slip
You guys really need to clean up your mess around there.

Old Mac Donald had a farm
Hey guys, hear me out here... did you take into consideration the fact that your winch is positioned (roughly) 1m below the top of the tower? Is it possible that you actually are dropping from *44* metres not 45? :)
My question is why did the open end of the can suck in. Looking like it got crunch in???
Old Mac Donald
e i e i o
That the whistle song 😙
Plz can u hart this comment
Greta Thornball there wrecking EVERYTHING. Make a bigger one and Call it Nigel ThornBally.
It oh McDonald had a farm
I dont know the others but if anybodys stuck on number 3 its the thomas the tank engine theme
If you put alot of metal pipes down on the barrel around you will get alot better result
can someone photoshop Derek on the jet ski onto a lake or something?

Hitting that flat in "Mary Had a Little Lamb" was a bit unexpected...
mary had a little lamb is the first whistle
I was part of the 44 Club and didn't even know it! :D
Old Mcdonald had a farm was the first song
Gaunson got the right answer for all the wrong reasons. 😀 And no one yelled Geronimo!

Noo you should call it chase the mace. Please
Do you own this tower?
Rexy BAILED from that Jet ski like his life depended on it!!
Can we get mentions of 44 Club overlayed with the reverse footage of Spike Tyson hitting the concrete??
Smashed it all. Excellent
I’d love to see some night drops with everything painted so it glows in the dark.
gyroscopic prescession lastweek and bernulli's principal this week, gaunsen is on fire.
R.I.P. Bruse
His whistle was old mydonald
my guess on why the barrel imploded would be because the water created a void when leaving, and it left at such speed it acted like a seal so no air could enter. so the pressure of the atmosphere caved in the barrel. 17 pounds of force on every single square inch of the barrel.
Old Mc Donald had a farm, also hi
5:23 cavitation

Weird, an intro that was shot...after the stuff was smashed. Never done before I can tell you that! 👍🏻 44 club!
Fridays are my favorite day of the week because of these guys
Bingo was his name oh, B I N G O
Spike looks like Covid. And that 'sand' pit has to be 50% assorted junk by now, doesn't it??
They have multiple rexies and they make t seem like it is the same one ;)
im Just happy and impressed you were whistling Bear necessities
This is so ridiculous you should be building something out of it
Actually, you can't compress any liquid, not just water.
Love the videos?? But they need to mute you guys screaming like little bitches out. It’s constantly happening. And you need need to go back to the damn or something fun. Like the basketball hits for world records. Just gets super boring to see crap dropping off the the same tower. Over and over and over again
Axe vs spike ball please
1 Old McDonald 2 You can't always get what you want 3 What you know 4 Bare Necessities   44 CLUB SHAYS AND FOREVER!!!!💪🤙

Gaunson, I think that science was dead on the money, dude.
Can we all agree that when He uploads our day gets better! 💖
The first song was twinkle twinkle little star 😎
I’m evils son..

Did I hear an f bomb?
I'm not seeing the same theory yet in the comments, just fragments of both which I think combine to create the barrel implosion:   I'm speculating low-pressure is created by a combination of Brucie forcing the evacuation of water rapidly as well as the deformation of the bottom of the barrel; stretching the barrel outward at the bottom increases the interior volume, but the already low-pressure area where the water was (and which is now creating a seal) has increased, further decreasing the pressure of the vacuum. Another solid idea is the water rapidly rising along the sides upward with an interior cavitation may be an example of Bernoulli's principle with the water "pulling" the sides inward.  All of these may be contributing to the same outcome, but with any regard, this should become ubiquitously referred to as Gaunson's principle. Or maybe the Gaunson Effect.
You need a camera filming out parallel to the ground from the top so when the tennis balls come up we can see if they make it that far of past init
Should make a tungsten giant dart
BINGO!
A while back a guy designed a camera rig that put multiple cameras on an arch. As the subject moved through the cameras it created a sort of stop motion effect. I know that beyond the press and the king of random both have something similar, but as a full circle. If you understand what I’m trying to describe… we’ll I think something like that would be awesome to see done with the splashes.
Song 1: E-I-E-I-O, old McDonald Song 2: you can’t always get what you want Song 3: What you want Song 4: bear necessities
I beg to differ but you most certainly can compress water if you do compress it right you get ICE " 7 "        it's believed that. ICE. " 7 " can be found on several of Jupiter's moons
6 lol
I just learned mid video im part of the 44 club cuz i  watch the vids all the way through

So, the barrel with tennis balls.  Great idea, but!!  what if upside down so it acts like water jets launching the barrel upwards?
For the next comtest it should be how many drops has rexy been through!
Old Mcdonald
You guys should try the barrels again, but put a lid on them, it makes sure the water can't go anywhere but the pipes, and see how high you can get them
The pallet added to the cracked pavers.   Not a fair test
Whistle song from Stanford is "ya can't always get whatcha want"

Old MacDonald Had a Farm-E-I-E-I-O IS THE TUNE...PLEASE PIN ME!!!!!!
I think the wood springing back broke the last few....redo on solid base please 🙏
The water rushed out of the barrel causing a low pressure zone inside that collapsed the barrel as the atmosphere tried to fill the vacuum.

Maybe for the next vid, you could drop the spike ball of destruction onto an old car or something like that
“Old McDonald Had A Farm” is the song
Spike ball reminds me of something from like Mario 64.
Whistle was old MacDonald had a farm
They wouldn’t have broken that many pavers but if they had been stacked on a metal plate. The middle 2x4 of the pallet concentrated the pressure in the middle of the pavers and allowed them to flex and snap.
I love the music during the slow mo's
Hey guys watch the slow-mo again. The pallet act like a shock absorber. You need to do it again straight against the ground. My guess would be you would pretty much clear out all of the pavers in a bigger more cool super fun giant cloud of dust and stuff!
First one was an interesting rendition of Old MacDonald Had A Farm
You guys need to find a vacuum sealed vault to do these drops. They exist. No wind resistance or anything. Yes, it's like using cheat codes... but you'll get phenomenal results and footage.

Gaunson's just about on-point with the barrel collapsing in around Bruce. Water goes out, vacuum/void is formed, barrel collapses from the void as it gets refilled with air.
15:25 looks just like the world trade centers. Like a bomb went off.
Can u do Brucey against an i beam
you guys need to do a "all the times Rexy has died video"
Boys, put the lids on the barrels. It'll give the water some opportunity to do it's thing before the vacuum?
What.... 44 dislikes
May I have a piece of the orange paver? It would be a nice surprise for my daughter.
I just saw the shovel one for the first time last night
🇵🇭✋❤️❤️
EI, EI, O
They both lost, 5 is not between 0 and 5. Not unless you say between 0 and 5 inclusive.
ya should of painted the spike ball like a blue shell. a blue shell will always hit its target.
BINGO was his name-o!!!
I was in gingin for last 3 days , I could have gone a seen it
old mcdonald had a farm!!!! PIN MEEEE PLS
Larger tubes and a top on the barrel.
Science with Gaunson was actually pretty good today! The fist transfers a lot of its energy into the water, pushing it out. The water is using all exits to leave, so that air cannot get in. This creates a vacuum inside the drum underneath the water, crunching it like a can.
I still say call it "Spiked Lee"
How are they able to film this stuff? Isn't Australia now a totalitarian police state under the dominance of the inherently inefficient, wasteful, & coercive territorial monopolist known as Government?  Clearly Australia has been overrun by the very same Totalitarian Globalist Kleptocrats that are looking to enslave the USA, and they have successfully  turned most of Australia literally back into the penal colony (aka prison) that it once was... but do the How Ridiculous boys live in a part of Australia that is still relatively free? if so where are they filming this? or is it not in AUS?
Old MacDonald, You Can't Always Get What You Want - Rolling Stones, What You Know - Two Door Cinema Club, Bare Necessities from the Jungle Book... Yes, I can smash the light bucket.
If you put a metal plate on top of the water in the barrel when the hulk fist hits it will only be able to go out the side's.
I’m surprised they don’t Velcro wind screens (like the ones you find on tennis courts) around the top of the tower while they film.
Amazing 👏.  But we need more quality 1440p

Please just fill up a barrel with gasoline, light it up and then drop an Atlas stone on it... 🤔😜
Oh man, those barrels getting crushed by the vacuum left by Bruce was great.
For the songs: Old MacDonald, God of War, & Bear Necessities  👉😎👉
Put a wooden plate on the water and the balls will go forever
Ol Micky Donald
Spike crushing the pavers looked eerily similar, the way the debris scattered, to the World Trades Center towers falling.  Spike is awesome but I still have a special place in my heart for Bruce.
If you haven't named yet my idea is Bowser!! :)
Brutal impact spike ball never disappoints
B
Man editor Jack's voice is deep
The barrel collapsing on itself was because of an instant vaccum where the body of water created a momentary barrier at the opening of the barrel with minimal air under it and Bruce's fist going down creating suction which due to it and due to minimal air the barrel collapsed and in more simple way when you drink out of a plastic bottle of water and you suck on it very hard the bottle collapses because you are sucking the air out of it and there is no place where air goes in the bottle so it collapses

Go back and check your slow-mo of the spike ball vs. stack.  The pallet collapsed creating a knife edge on the middle runner for the bottom layers to be flexed and broke over.  Try it again but with a solid steel plate that won't flex supporting the stack and see what your results are.
Spiked wrecking Ball versus concrete starts @ 14:04  *YOU'RE WELCOME*

I noticed the guys cheated, only reason they went through all was cause of the pallet. I say we demand a retest and this time dont use a pallet. I bet they wont go through them all, if they leave out the pallet

at 6:58 the rainbow morphs into a real rainbow. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Old mcdonald
Bernoulli's Principle. The water was moving so fast around the fist that it created such a low pressure difference from the outside air that it overcame the structural integrity of the steel drum. Still wicked cool!
Missed opportunities- “You know what you can’t compress? 6 between 0 and 5.” “Good clap, I give it a 6 outta 5.” Haha
Awesome video guys!💯🇺🇲🇺🇲💯!!!
Definitely whistled "Old McDonald"
Nothing to do with pressure imo.  Bottom was pushed down, so sides were pulled in.
Seeing a lot more cuts than usual. Like in other videos there wouldn’t be a cut every couple of seconds but this one there is. Still an awesome video and I’ve been watching this channel for five years now! Y’all are awesome! ❤️

there videos are good i could watch them all day
Give Bruce brass knuckles
the reason the barrel compressing was due to the vacuum created from the rush of water out whilst creating the a low pressure zone inside the barrel and the atmospheric pressure crushed the barrel

Old McDonald had a Farm
The momentum of the water getting out of the way keeps going and leaves a vacuum behind which crushes the can.
Hi, big fan here. What you guys could do is have on the opening of the barrel a wooden or metal circular plate that when bruce or atlas hit it it will push the water down like a syringe and plunger, forcing all of the water through the tubes? maybe?
FYI you boys dumped 195955.8702 Joules of energy into those pavers. That's about a 1/4 stick of dynamite.
Just have to say, the only big number my kid knows is 44.

Jack is on the money.  Well pointed out that it was interesting in the first place. Should make a drum with a solid steel rim and see if the drum collapses like a crushed soda can.
Congrats, you picked a stupid name. Should have been named Bowser.
Please get liquid nitrogen and freeze stuff to drop or to drop on. The slow mo will be EPIC.
lovely livery on spiky!
It displaced the water so quickly it created a vacuum which destabilized the barrel before neutral pressure could be achieved

Rexy on a jetski
Ok, back when the spike ball debuted, I suggested that its name should be Gordon, based off a video game enemy called Gordo which is a living spike ball. And now with the black paint job and orange spikes it almost looks like a Gordo! All its missing is a big pair of googley eyes!
A 3 or 4 point broad head that weighs the same
Very good intro laddds

You should forge the tungsten cube into the tip of an OG mega dart.      Not the bigger mega dart. That one wasn’t as fun to watch.
The fact that I bought that shirt size medium a week before this video came out makes me sad. Lol
10:54 I'm not sure but, I think they're not using the right type of shovel to dig holes. I wonder if the shovel experts that attacked William Osman will try to cancel how ridiculous

*Herron sprays his sleeve* Me: pshhh just sell it on the store Gaunson: "Can I just say you could probably put that on the store..." Herron: "It's on the store right now"
Just a warning for everyone to never spray paint your body. It's 1000x worse than breathing it in. The heavy metals in the paint travel through your pores and get into your bloodstream. Don't do that. Have a nice day :)
Y’all should do Spike Ball vs Giant Axe!
i love your videos
for the barrel implosion, I would guess that it was from a cavitation effect.

What about Kidney Stone
take barrels like this, give them a lid so they push more water out the tubes, and I think that would look fantastic

To win the Commtest you need to guess all 4 song title names that Stanford whistled in the same comment, good luck!
The difference between Bruce and the stone with the barrels is interesting. Because water could more easily escape the open top around Bruce it caused a void to form similar to a cavitation bubble that caused The barrel to implode. Because there was less free space around the atlas stone, water got trapped and led to the barrel exploding instead
#1 oh McDonald had a farm
Most awesome slow-ies from 15:10 on! Some of the best!
Everything after the slowie to the next 3-2-1 is purely skippable.
How many doors and glass sheets next
The song is surely Bear Necessities!
I got a great name for the next diet fad the great void. Or just call it get voided.

you guys should put paint powder in the tubes on those barrels and something that'll pop in the barrel so the air pressure makes huge colours clouds!
That was a banger of a vid boys..  Respect from Buffalo New York.  44 Club lets smash the like button.
The poor pavers (I can't spell for the life of me)
44 club is Ireland
i dont think a vacuum alone would be enough pressure to crush a steel drum like that, i think also part of it is the force of the fist hitting and warping the bottom, and also the rushing water creating negative pressure as it leaves the can due to the bernouli effect
Old Mac donald had a farm

I love how the change in pressure crumpled that steel drum like a coke can!

440 kilo Spike, through 44 pavers. Perfectly. The boys might be on to something.
In regards to the whistling. I recognized “You can’t always get what you want” and “Bear necessities” but the others must’ve been Katie Perry or from the Beebs.
THE PALLET MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FRACTURES AT THE BOTTOM.    CONCRETE STACK ON STEEL PLATE BATTLE.  WHO CAN BREAK THE MOST?!?!?

This needs to be done again but don't feel the barrels up so much maybe about half full
Meet up with faze flea
"A significant structural impact..." He's not wrong.
Mary had a spiky ball! S P I K Y
You guys should crush 3 cardboard cutouts of you guys 😃
My explanation of the physics of the barrel collapse is that Gaunsen got it pretty darn close. The water was simply pushed out of the way so fast that the air behind couldn't keep up, so a low pressure zone was created. Low pressure inside = crushed barrel.
Bear necessities?
new idea to do in the show === > connect large green lego plates tougher with lego pieces and build a large city buildings out of legs being few feet wide on all sides and good meter or tall buildings mixed with smaller buildings and have some type of ball coming down from above like a asteroid painted with red and orange paint  <==== see what survives the destruction of the physics?   and maybe make a building for each one of you guys to see who's building survives from the ball? :)
Old McDonald had a farm, Eee Iiii Eee Iiii OOO.

Just remembering the shovel video made my side hurt from laughing so hard. I'll be going back to that one shortly.
the first song is OLD MACDONALD HAD A FARM
It’s the.. bare necessities
Old McDonald had a farm eieio
Can we please name the next massive thing of destruction Jenny Craig??!! #44club
the first song was old macdonald had a farm the second song whistled was "You can't always get what you want" by The Who the fourth was the bare necessities
Well, you could do the math for most of the stuff you do, but, why do the math when you can destroy stuff

Should have called him "spikel angelo"
I think next, you gotta combine the ideas of the giant dart and the spike ball…make a single giant spike! Ultimate destruction
Saw on the news how bad the situation is in Australia...hope you and your families are safe.

Please stop whistling..
Barrel collapsed do to a vaccume because nothing could go out of it because there was nothing to get pushed out so it imploded basically someone else is probably already explain the though
Now old MacDonald is stuck in my head.

You can compress water; however, if you manage to compress it, it turns into ice
1st song old McDonald 4th song bear nessities
um.. 6?
You guys need to put steel bands around the barrels..
The song is the Bear Necessary from the Jungle Book

101 Uses for Rexy, coming up next.   Do eeeeit!
That pallet absorbed a lot of the impact.
I have no idea what to comment so yeah
Old MacDonald was the first song
As far as the barrel crumple in the first drop, it would be interesting to know how much the shape of the fist's design had an impact on the creation of the low pressure zone.   Since the sphere in the second drop didn't have the same effect.  Unfortunately I don't have a extensive background in fluid dynamics to explore that idea.
Gaunson now looks like he's on dope.
THAT SLO MO IS GLORIOUS! 😍 Watched all of the video too, boys. 😛
Old McDonald had a rexy
Give Brucee spikes on his knuckles it would make him the ultimate destroyer of everything
Can we just appreciate the spikes on Spike Tyson. Those things are absolute troopers, I was sure they'd be goners after the first video but nah they're just there, being spikey
Definitely can’t wait to see what else we can destroy with the spike Tyson I bet he could man handle a care
Marry had a little lamb
You can compress water it just becomes ice. It also can be compressed in a liquid state however it's incredibly marginal. I know this isn't relevant to the actual intent of the statement in the video but who doesn't like a little bit of trivia and getting a bit smarter
Old MacDonald!!
6 is 4 plus 2 and 2 4's is 44 mic drop
This lovely band of idiots managing to IMPLODE a steel 55 gallon drum ON ACCIDENT  is why we love them
Water actually can be compressed, but it takes a HUGE amount of pressure for a small amount of compression.

I turn on my surround sound so my neighbors have to listen to you scream like little girls.
The corridor digital sweatshirt 👀
yankee doodle dandy my boys!
I think the first bucket collapsed because the fist made a massive dent in the bottom of the barrel! The bottom of the barrel didn’t give way so the rest of the barrel had to crumple because it was still attached to the warped bottom piece.
Rexys trip to the hospital was one of the funniest hr moments ever 😂😂😂 long live rexy 🙌
You have the intonation skillset of an elderly cat lady
I wanted the boat to hit the axe first time…  But in the words of old McDonald. “You can’t always get what you want”  These are just the bare necessities of life I guess
EIEIO was the song that Stanford sang
Old McDonald had a farm - whistle
Gaunson was on the right track, but I don't think it was pushing air in that caused the implosion. I think the fist did such a great job landing in the barrel, that it pulled very little air into the water. As a result, it was able to effectively displace the water using kinetic energy alone, and as the water was being displaced, it was creating a seal on the way up. This left a vacuum cavity within the barrel, thereby pulling in the sides of the barrel.
He said we must guess the song, IT YANKIE DOODLE
old Mcdonald  first song
old mcdonald had a farm is the song
They should collab with zombie go boom. Spike Tyson v Ivan head
5:16 the thing is is hes actually like perfectly correct lmao

Awesome as always Boys. The pallet flexes and takes away from the impact significance. More or Less? I've no clue.  Its left to your amazing scientific approach to decipher these things

You need to drop something more round so water dose escape as much

Is Spike a Coronavirus cell?
should do it again with a circular bit of wood on top of the water. it will get destroyed but might force water through the pipes due to a better kinda seal? maybe.

Just got home from a shocking night shift, on my birthday, and there's this ripper video waiting for me. Thanks lads, was a great one :)
Maybe we should shrink wrap a couple hundred cans of spray paint together and find out what the spiked ball and the phantom can really do.
Glad to see Nigel back in the frame.

Actually, the water is making an airtight seal, so as it is rising, it is creating a vacuum at the bottom.

Nearly there Gaunson lol. The barrel collapsed because the water was forced out of the barrel so fast it left a vacuum behind (not the air Bruce was pushing in, but because the water was pushed out so fast, there was a short timne when air had no path in to balance the pressure but nearly all the water had vacated the barrel), and the air pressure of the atmosphere outside collapsed the barrel.
You are a terrible whistler, my friend.

Old MacDonald had a Farm ??? ??? ???
Scott: pick a number between 0 and 5  Stanford: *6*
Awesome Video. 💪 Watching this gave me the idea... I would love to see a heavy round ball ⚫ drop into a  round cilynder 🛢 that is made of thick steal or concrete filled with water. The ball must barely fit. The interesting part to see is, if the cylinder thing does not explode and the water has now way to go, will the concrete ball just shatter ? 🤔 Only one fun way to find out 🤙🤙
I must admit, every time there's a rock off, I root for Scott. WAY TO GO SCOTT!!!!!!!!!!

Love the barrel menorah!
Pound a hole in the ground using the spiked ball, line the hole with a tarp, fill with colored water, then drop the ball into the hole.
could the barrel have collapsed because the fist dented the bottom and that's what pulled the sides in and not a vacuum.
Bear necessities
“Old McDonald had a farm “ was the tune  Whistled
Old MacDonald
The void is called cavitation.
the song is old mcdonalds
Why does one of the barrels look like a menorah missing two branches?
The song Stanford was whistling was old McDonald had a farm
The songs Stanford whistled were: Old McDonald had a farm, From little things big things grow, not sure and Bare necessities.
Old McDonald, You can't always get what you want, shut up and dance , The Bare Necessities

The barrel collapsed because of the pressure differential caused by the rapid displacement of the water resulting in significant internal pressure drop large enough that the outward atmospheric pressure overcame the tensile strength of the steel
heyyy
For the comtest, old Macdonald had a farm, mary had a little lamb and bare necessities. Love from the UK 🇬🇧. Xxxx
Just wondering, what are the names of the songs you used in this video? Great video by the way!
With that paint job should have named it Bowser.
Old macdonald had a farm eee iii eee iii eee ooo
The first song that Stanford was whistling was obviously "Old McDonald had farm"
This would have been the perfect opportunity to make Mario Bros Rexy and have the wrecking ball be painted like the Spiny Eggs.
Love you fellas. Having said that, is it cringe to point out how the spike geometry is all wrong for dimensional stability for the punishment it's used for? Having said THAT, if you don't care about deforming spikes, then ignore me and carry on boys. show's amazing.

Call the spike ball the erchun like a sea erchun thingy that if you stand on it hurts
Old MacDonald had a farm EIEIO
Science with gaunson was actually right this week the hek
Whistling tunes: 1) 6:00 Old McDonald 2) 9:32 ??? 3) 11:22 ??? 4) 13:30 Bear Nessesities  I probably haven't heard the 2nd & 3rd tunes.
Every video, they say '' Will pin ya '' But they  don't !
Do it with colour powder
xi3mf vyn.fyi
Loving the subtle show of a KFC bucket… twice 🤣
You guys missed a great opportunity for a *bonus* drop.  Dropping Bruce-In-A-Barrel on the giant axe probably would have freed him brilliantly!
Video idea:Spike tyson vs all others. For example spike  tyson vs bruce
1. Old McDonald 2.no idea 3.Pure necessities
Ez Old McDonald
I love the paint job you guys gave Spike Tyson! The black and orange really looks good on him!
I thought the Spike was gonna damage himself but he held up none! 😮
OLD MC DONALD       ok pin me now
bare necessities is one of the songs
#44
Mary had a little lamb
Old Macdonald had a farm is the song, childhood classic
Jump on “Denis” the Phantom Menace!!! 😂🤣🤣🤣
I could barely make out the first whistled tune and had absolutely no idea what came after that.  Sorry, but your whistling suuuuuucccccckkkkkkkssssss!!!  Not that I could do any better, mind.  LOL  Really enjoyed the concrete.  Have to say that I thought you short-changed Bruce on his attempt as some of the pavers below where you counted for him were cracked but you didn't keep going to find them.  All's fair, after all although, I will admit, Spike Tyson obliterated every paver on his way to the bottom.
First one was old mcdonald had a farm. Second one no clue. Third one no clue  Fourth one bear necessities
Bet you won’t pin this
1 marry had a little lamb
I love this video keep it up guys!!!!!!!!
I got the bear necessities and old McDonald, not sure about the middle two
9:39, You can't always get what you want.
Bare necessities
Another classic Science with Gaunson.
Nice to see Bruce!
Should have called it "CAPTAIN CRUNCH"   Missed opps haha
Rexy is said every time they upload I swear lol
How Christian of you to name your toy after a rapist.
Twinkle twinkle little star E I E I O
So why don't you guys just put up a tent up there on top of that windy tower?
whistle song is Ol' McDonald had a farm
Jetski-Rexy Merch?
SCIENCE WITH GAUNSON is the best 👌
Shout-out to Editor Jack with the Corridor Digital represent!
First drop: I think the water left the barrel in a way that created a seal at the top which made the area between the water and Brucie a very low-pressure zone, thus the ensuing collapse.

Contest, old Macdonald had a farm #44club #howgood
Song: old McDonald had a farm or twinkle twinkle little star
WOW, the water ejected from the barrel so fast it created a Vacuum so powerful it collapsed the barrel. that was impressive!
Always a joy watching the complete and utter distraction of random things lol
1st Whistle Song Old Mcdonald Had A Farm
Absolutely love science with gaunson
At least the music slowy music was better today.  I reckon a new weapon would be a caltrop/makibishi to really spike something good and proper!
Of McDonald's
Old McDonald’s had a farm 🎶
COMMTEST - "Bear Necessities"
1. Old McDonald's had a farm, 2 you can't always get what you want. 3 idk. 4 bear necessities
I'd rate this a 6 out of 0-5
Saturday Ridiculous
Definitely the first whistle is old McDonald because...he has chickens....which is sold to McDonalds for nuggets   The second one is also a famous song that is unknown to me but known to people  And the third one is bear necessity...because we all need the bear necessity of nuggets and food
They don’t call him hole digger heron for nothing
old mac donald
Papa gauno I have an answer. Pressure
The song is Old mcdonald had a farm
Love ya vids
Cheeky

WoW
Old mc Donald had a farm.
YES! They painted it! It physically hurt how rusty they allowed it to get.
Old McDonald had a farm
Ol McDonald had a farm is the song 🎵
The first song was old McDonald
The song: Old McDonald Had a Farm
6:40 Rainbow water makes real rainbow
The drum compressed because the water rushed out so fast it created a vacuum of air.  That was wicked cool.
I must admit, every time there's a rock off, I root for Scott. WAY TO GO SCOTT!!!!!!!!!!
The song the Stanford whistled was Mary had a little lamb
Old McDonald had a farm 🐔
are those soudal drums??
6:00 Old Mac Donald had a farm e i e i o
Yankee Doodle went to town, riding on a rexy
How ridiculous: You can't compress water. Ocean: Am I a joke to you?  Water can indeed be compressed, but it is extremely difficult and I would assume becomes exponentially harder to compress the more it is compressed. But at the bottom of an ocean the water is denser, due to the extreme pressure from the weight/ force of the water above.
The shovel video is one of the best things you've ever done!! I laughed so hard during it.  I'd love for you guys to do another 101 uses for something!

Why you change the usual thumbnail 😕 ?

Me trying to find the pinned comment about old MacDonald and his farm...
Sup
Twinkle twinkle little star 🌟!
If you're going to call it the thousand-pound spikeball it should weigh a thousand pounds in your other video when you revealed the spiky metal ball it said that it was 970 something pounds not a thousand hounds so unless you guys had a new one made that is actually a thousand pounds you should change the description of the name of this video
I think the song that Scott whistled was Mary had a little lamb
I love watching you guys
Old McDonald had a farm! lol
Gauson was pretty much correct, it created an area of low pressure as Brucy went in and the water went out the side pipes.  The area of low pressure created the vacuum which collapsed the barrel.
The old McDonald’s and bear necessities whistle was off tune  But I still understood!
9:45 well thats not in one piece anymore.
There should be "Math With Stanford" counterpart merch to "Science With Gaunson" 🤣
The old drum sucksion paradocs!
Old MacDonald had a farm
The song is “Old Mcdonald had a farm”
Would love to see Hulks Fist vs a baked ham
Whistled songs are: I’d I was too focused on the video hahah great video can’t lie
Old MacDonald had a farm
Song 1 is old mc donnald.
i think myself anyway that from the friction of the fist going down it heats the metal of the barrel but then with the water it also cools the metal at a accelerated rate the the metal shrinks down on itself an folds in at the weakest points
6:07 ight, I'll give up now then.
G’day guys
Old Mc Donald
With the barrel, I think it was a pressure differential reaction.

Old MacDonald
Celebrate the first day of spoop month with a video how good
You guys should cut a large circle of ply, or some sort of strong barrier and float it on the water in the barrel.  that'll push down all the water out the pipes. That would go higher than tower. May also save the complete crumple.
Name a fruit that's yellow  Stanford: Orange
Old mcdonald for sure
