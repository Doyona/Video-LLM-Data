Bob Fitzgerald On TNT?
This was definitely one of the best games of the first round
I SMELL AN UPSET GAME 7!!!
Enjoing This game. twisterokc.com
Quit watching!!!!!
Who cares go to China and play I'd rather play marbles and watch you guys anymore you're all communist bastards

CP is mentally strong.
dragon ball super broly full movie
AlmosT  give & take..

😎
NBA idiots should have stayed out of politics !!!   Good bye forever !!!
BLM is a militant, Marxist front inciting riots in an effort to overthrow the US constitution: https://youtu.be/_TJpqSZ8ACc
Rebound!!!!!!- u playin w a great help!!!
Pj tucker suck ass had 1 fucking job
Where tf was cp3 last year damnnnnnnnnn
lets go thunder!
Like in subscribe we follow back
Okc won but they should feed Adams more
imagine if cp3 goes to the clippers with kawhi
OkC for semis 😁
Home court advantage for okc.
Have to give the vets credit frfr Chris Paul, Melo,Lebron, and if wade was playing he would be in the playoffs right now.
Dennis schroder has been the unsung hero for OKC. He's so freakin' underrated.
Ucfhhgfhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZPa9wm5kyLS8YcuUrIehQQ
This what happens when you live and die behind the 3-pointer
Lol dennis schroder moves like a ninja
Nice game Oklahoma city
Where is westbrook?
Chris Paul still has it... Damn
Chris pail is 6ft y’all and he looks more like 5’9
When people say that CP3 is the player on the thunder, they are dellusional. Shai is way better and is only 22.
tucker getting traded now
I like OKC energy..Good Stuff..
I want to watch the nba, but don't want to support stuff being blown out of proportion and such.
This will most likely be a close, intense series. It might go to game 7.
08:26 that's a travel.
1:24 Rockets defense: It's just a driving dunk, one of the lowest efficiency plays in the game.
I was promised a sweep. Then a gentleman's sweep. Now all is see is "good for Chris Paul. They still gonna lose tho."
CP3 is taking this very personal against Harden and D'Antoni. He's out to prove something to them.
If the Thunder end up winning the series this will be a great sport story for years to come. Nobody thought OKC would make the playoffs, Thunders former star plays for Rockets and Rockets former star plays for Thunder. Incredible.
The mid range shot is not dead as you can see from Chris Paul. He couldn’t make threes so he started taking the mid range
Schröder with 30 btw
westbrook need to come back
The"united nations thunder" tied the series
Gotta love Chris Paul
Can we sit and admire Dorts hustle and defense for a moment
Put some respect on Chris Paul’s name. People forget just how good and smart of a player this dude is. Fucjing legend cp3 a boss leading his team you see him on the court vocal yelling telling people what to do yelling back at the other teams he don’t back down he a dog and Dennis fucjing shrewder it how ever u spell his name is money. What a game by shruder. Small guy but lighting quick. He always caught my eye over the years. And now looks like he fully developed his game with guys like cp3 teaching you and schooling and having your back. What a team what great amazing players.
I seriously think they need to limit Tucker's minutes, I mean he missed a critical basket at 8:23 that sealed the deal for the thunder. 🤨
That pass at 4:25 was basketball IQ at its highest
tf refs this drive is travel! 5:10
Paul should take more shots he a very unselfish player
OKC won more playoff games in a series than with Russ and Playoff P lol
Chris Paul changed his name to Chris Ball
I hope okc wins the series lmfao
This make the series more interesting  here's my playoff prediction for this series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=og6Uzyuafvo
How the f did okc win🤯🤯🤯
Y’all sleeping on Jeff green
Click the below link you will be watching an amazing comedy mashup video https://youtu.be/oFdSJGrzBpo
CP3 making 2-2 series. Looks like he has something to tell with houston.. Lol
Great game
Still don’t want Westbrook to comeback cmon
They fucked up when they made it personal with cp3. He was bussing harden ass every time they were one on one. I would love for Okc to upset them.
Thunder won
Tucker has step back in this series
I’m a rockets fan  these refs giving me a headache every time when the thunders in the paint foul foul foul
Yo pj Tucker really sold the bag. If he made that corner three we would’ve won. I mean Houston
Just imagine if they where thunders fans last game and this game LOUD
You guys are really dumb Russ isn’t playing 🤦🏽‍♂️
cp3 changed a whole organization. thats tuff cp3 was never the problem in Houston. I have okc winning this series if Dennis is having a good night for the next two games. rockets are a hype team.
Cp3 ❄️❄️❄️
A lot of nationalities in Philly raptors as well
I believe lakers will win the trophy
Thunder is gonna move on
2:16 how is that not a moving foul on covington ?
And now there’s beef with some thunder players and brodie. Got this series more interesting.
Soooo...the rockets shoot a NBA playoff record 58 threes and lost by 1 three lol smh um how does that work!?
Cris paul accountability 💪 thankyou cp3👌
Rockets fan here  Dantoni has to go immediately. You're up 15 points and instead of running plays, you keep shooting threes.. wtf? HE HAS TO GO
U don't know bball if u don't know CP3 is clutch....been that way his whole career... injuries is what kept him down....
Oh shit I didn't realize steven adams is back
The moment OKC did't run out to guard that wide open 3 ... (55 seconds in) I just sat there and thought "Is this PLAYOFF Basketball? WTF"
Defense is the key
the rockets d though
If Houston loses game 5, the series is over.
Gogogooo rockets...
This is the best series of NBA history because of Covid there is no Homcourt advantage.. I wish every finals this will be the set up. To see if your team is really a bad Ass.
What I’m loving so far about the bubble is that there’s no home court advantage. This is the most even playing field we have seen
.. Down by 20 and a win  cris paul prove   that playing a consistent game that he is a high level contender.
Okc is playing with heart
Colin Cowherd praise the Rockets after after game one cause Russ wasn't playing saying this the best they ever look👀😂😂 he didn't bring up this series not one time yesterday but watch today he going to bring up OKC doing good & some how try to shit on Russ again
CP3 is very competitive player. He's a kind of player that never give up. For me he is a great team leader
Okc really has a chance to win this series? Okayyy
Rockets should just rebuild.
So much isolation play for okc, this will not work in the 2nd round
Chris paul is doin what Westbrook couldnt do being a real point guard
When Chris Paul played with the Rockets and him and Harden was beefing, I think it's safe to say Paul was right lol
I think Chris belongs here lmao glad pandemic p went
Russ is playing in game 5!!
What if the rockets faces Anthony Davis, mcgee, Howard and LeBron in the second round
Rockets over confidence
9:10 Tucker what are you doing lol
at 2:21 you can see robert covington tackle 2 okc players so harden can get an open 3
Finally OKC will make the 2nd round of the playoffs, maybe westbrook is just the culprit hahah
Dennis Schroder has been the key for OKC the last 2 games are his best games in this series and it resulted to a win
I hope OKC will not trade CP3, they must rebuild like spurs.
Crossing my fingers on CP3s health...
Cp3 Midshot is 🎆🎆
Cp3 is great
Damn, mad respect to the Thunder. I was about to FFWD to the end, glad I didn't. Matter of fact I'm going back to watch the 2nd half again!
The real Aqua Man is Steve Adams🧜‍♂️💪😱
2:00 looked like a travel
Gogo okc
Harden the first two games is smiling like the series is over already, where you at westbrook?
Westbrook is doing his best cheerleader impression every game
Whyy rockets
Rockets threw this one in the late game but they will be alright tho it’s tie up let’s hope they get this dub and and finish strong
2-0 then then the media said cp3 running short..lol
Kenneth faried for the rocket he is fit in small ball system of rockets
i don't see okc winning the series but gg
Nice for OKC, i thought they were gonna get swept
The NBA playoffs is back baby.
Amazing game.
Rockets need to fire the coach and get mark Jackson
Tucker gotta go next season
Cp3 is quietly carrying the team
C. P. THREEEEEEEEEE!!!!!
Cp3 wants to prove that he can beat Rockets
Rockets in 7, who wanna bet? Just reply ur thoughts, let's make this comment section full of thoughts
Don't be agitated!  This series more looking like a 7-game down-the-wire matchup!! Harden against five OKC🌞!
Cp3🔥🔥
James Harden pushes off more than Michael Irving.
Why don't they let Tyson chandler play???
I am really rooting for this team I like underdog teams
Isnt this the Warriors commentator? Cool he works for tnt now?
If Russ was in this game he would’ve taken away a lot of those missed threes and drove to the bucket 😔
4:47 look at Houston bench clapping for cp3 💀
This is 100% on harden. They should have won this game but harden let okc walk to the basket late. No hand up on defense, no effort at all. Then on offense he commits a lazy turnover after a terrible drive and flop the possession before. The entire team plays with incredible intensity except for him.
@8:42 Shows same free throw twice
HOUSTON Rockets 114 vs 117 OKLAHOMA CITY Thunder
Dennies Schroeder is rondo with a jump shot 🤷🏽‍♂️
Thunder big win
Is it just me because i really want both of them to reach the second round.
Houston at 6
Where is Russ ? Can someone please tell .
i had youtube premium and now i dont and ads are weird af to me rn
Props to okc but Houston has one play style and it bites them every game neither are build for next round
lol at 2:18
What does this tell you about WESTBROOK? CP3 has the same team he had lmao
Again.... Playoff Beard is not my cup of tea 🤣 Byebye Rockets. Byebye Mr. Travelling 🏃‍♂️ guy. 🤣🤣
I really hope CP3 wins a championship somehow before he retires.. he deserves one badly.
D'Antoni at it again. His systems have never worked.  His system is cheap 2k20 Park offense that doesn't work in the NBA.  OKC made this a series because Morey and D'Antoni shipped Capela away.  Nobody to stop drives at the hoop after defenders get beat...not the way basketball works irl.  Fuckn D'Antoni.
Steven Adams from Atlantis
Chris Paul would of went to the Lakers , oh man .
am I hearing a Warriors' commentator?
#thunderup⚡
Once again Harden, just doesn't have that dog in him.
Imagine okc knocking the rockets out In the first round😂 cp3 deserves a ring
rockets suck
Warriors shot caller Bob Fitzgerald holding it down 🎙 🤜
why westbrook is not playing ?
By the looks of it, Harden may not win a ring if this continues. And thats sad.
CP3
Nobody talking about how Westbrook wouldn’t have got this team to the playoffs 🤕
Rockets live and die by the three.....they had wide open midrange shots...harden passed up so many layups. This team will be lucky to win this series
What the f
The 3 guard line up for rockets wins games tho
Those missed 3 from Houston. Reminded me of game 7 2018 WCF. LMFAO
Cp3 balled out
Ok now it's to the point where we need Russ back in
Jr Smith why is there one of our teammates on the rockets bench?
I like the way Rockets are competing without Westbrook.If Westbrook played Rockets could have swept the thunder or go up 3-1 already.
It’s like watching the warriors and rockets series again
Choke HAHAHAHAHA
CP3 is a beast though crazy he has no ring yet
A 0.2% making the playoffs team beating the rockets..
bro whyy
Why Tucker and Cordon always get mad when they call foul on them? I mean they committed fouls and get mad at the referees 🤷
We need Westbrook back
Good win OKC
Hey Chris... I hope you and your young team does well. You ain't never won anything your whole career. Now would be a good start.
Gandang Laban to 2-2 na
#THUNDERNATION BABY
Thank god. Hate harden and the rockets. Getting bodied by cp3 and shai
Final score 114 - 117 Lets ADD 114+117 = 231  23+1 = 24 😰😰😰
OKC looks sooo good it’s tied 2-2😱😱😱
Cp3 redemtion
so now what westbrook!!!  beat that rockets .
What's up with all these commercials????!
If okc made it to the 2nd round is it safe to say that after Westbrook left and having CP3 made the team better
These 2 teams are actually relatives..
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day has been ruined
Please subscribe to my channel thanks https://youtu.be/BSWZGrHG9T0
Chris paul is great leader on court he can make everybody play better
Adams subs out to rest,the whole okc looks like a small ball team. 🤔
Westbrook shows how a fucking a child can't lead a team just by what cp is doing this alone he's got my respect more than brook brick.
Am.i the only one still surprises that this is what we come to  ..?.  A digital crowd 🤔
Where’s Westbrook at when you need him
CP3
Christ basketball is so boring to watch these days.
I've always loved basketball, but there is something odd and off about this new version of the game. If you were born in the last 20-25 years you will not understand where I'm coming from with this observation.
schroeder amazing talent
Imagine the Rockets had Chris Paul...
let me guess houston coach is still d'antoni lol... same old same old dont work in postseason guy is so stubborn
Rockets losst the series
CP3 balling, he got more to prove to not just his self, but the whole 🚀 organization. 💯 #CP3Said🖕🏽#HardenAnd🚀’s
Houston really is the most inconsistent nba team when it comes to 3 balls that's why need Westbrook mans better play in game 5
Everyone's just not gonna talk about Harden's incredible defense at 0:13?
M all in on Chris Paul... He deserves more than the beard guy.. M LA fan tho
It reminds of game 7 of HOU vs GS
Ma bois lookin goood..  #ThunderUp
There is no way rockets can stand up to lakers without westbrook .Lakers have too many tall and athletic people. Wish Lebron gets his ring , bruh he trying for one for some years now and always GSW  used to be in his way.
Oh the beard loss
Mad respect for okc and cp3.
As people say PJ Tucker is a valuable and a good role player...I still can say I just dont like the dude he thinks he is way too nice🤣
Did I just watch a 3 point contest? 🤔
CP3 for MVP. 🔥🔥🔥
30 seconds left, James Harden needs to take that 3.
Now the game begins
Hope the Thunder win just so CP3 can laugh at Houston and Harden.
what kind of shooting form is that lol
I think okc win this match because rockets is good in begining not in ending
The fvck harden what was that?
CP3 Legendary!!!
James harden and the rockets really could be champions already like 2 years now if they played any defense. The way they were knocking down 3s in the first half and 3rd quarter was great they just couldnt stop the thunder from scoring. Than when the rockets shooting from 3 died....which btw always happens because ya arms get tired shooting 50 3s a game ...ya cant get up ....kinda like a tortoise and the hare story...
Rockets be playing like flight
Thunder not winning another game
Steve Adams have to be a all star before he retire he has the potential
Who the f is Jordan tucker 😂
why everyone falling on the ground lol
Let's go cp3. Let's go okc
Glad to see okc still in this .
Live by the 3 die by the 3
Rockets played like they don't care at all.
Houston.. choking like always
Anyone on OKC roster can score on Harden smh
I knew the thunder was gonna give rockets a run for their money. The THUNDER  are a good team.
If OKC win this series Rockets going think about letting CP3 go
It’s so funny how the rockets are dangerous but at the same time,a danger to themselves 😂
The beginning looks like a video game, maybe it's just me.
Series all tied up had know dis was comin wanna the better underestimated series these playoffs no cap lol stay safe God bless BLM checkout The Main Squeeze🙏
GSW commentator commenting
I was one of probably tens of thousands who counted the CP3 Thunder out as a has been franchise but hoooooo was I wrong.
Rockets are trash.  They always do this. Doesn't matter the round. I know they will choke eventually. I feel the same way about the blazers and they have yet to prove me wrong
As a UTA fan, i hope OKC dominates HOU. OKC is a much more favorable matchup for UTA.
Really genius game OKC superb performance all team members come on.... 🏀🏀🏀🍸🔥🔥🔥
Black Mamba mentality cant be stopped, NBA Champions 2020🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆Go Laker Nation!!!!
Nobody deserves a ring in this league more than Chris Paul
Harden as usual doing nothing when someone has the ball. He's just gonna stand there and do nothing. Shows how he is just a fame chaser not a ring chaser.
Good job Chris Paul and the Thunder!!
Cp3 wants to really beat this team
Dort locking Harden up
Whenever I need motivation in life I see 2019-20 OKC team. Hats off CP3 👑
No defense on both sides
Thunda boiz
i guarantee this will be the last w by the thunder. (we need westbrook)
Harden always choke when pressure playoff comes
Chris paul is about to prove something...
WOW CP3 💪
Nobody is going to congrats Lu Dort for locking down harden?
Now I know y'all didn't think Mr.cp3 was gonna go down without a fight
CP3 is dangerous when he can run the team completely on his own, and doesn't have to deal with egos.
How the hell did HOU lose when they made tons of 3s...LOL
continue being the POINT GOD, CP3
Lmao cp3 revenge for getting traded 🤣
CP3 was scorching man
First round exit!  No 🧢
I’m happy for SGA, Big up Hamilton!!
https://youtu.be/EHIL5k44PgQ
https://youtu.be/EHIL5k44PgQ
I swear reading these comments are so damn funny and Entertaining😂
Ay that adams rebound and jam in the 1st was fire. Schroder was a difference maker..you can tell hes learning from cp3
You wouldn't appreciate this without knowing the drama between Houston and OKC, Harden and CP3
Talking about leadership cp3 got it. But still a dirty player ..just very good at it
photoshop
houston's style of basketball will never win a championship
Harden will never taste championship
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtlQ8LRP_Xg&list=PL_n2DmSw49-EaxVXCHSz8I-N9h8vQjgud
Imagine being down by 15 and still manage to close that game..thunder in 7
Even without the warriors, I can't see the rockets winning on western conference.
Harden no defense at all
Harden is passing a lot more love to see it
Schroder and Paul is just popping off. Even with the Rockets small ball defense, they can’t even stop them 🔥
houston fans its gonna be a sweep okc fans steven adams and company and then mr chris paul enter the chat lol
How the hell did Houston let those girls win? 🤦🏾‍♀️
Olaying smallball works if.... There is teamwork... Assist... And jumpshots... Harden is a one on one player... They need to have a legit inside threat...
Harden's shoes is dopeeeee
Need Westbrook
The Rockets are the only team that for a entire game can get away with moving screens!
the thunder have 3 elite point guards men smh😂
Lets Go Cp3 How Dare The Rockets Try To Play u Win or lose this Series U Just Made it Get Very interesting u always make teams look great revolving around u my man cp3 getting old but he still out there giving that work i like both Teams still i always love Houston Rockets As Well James Harden & Westbrook My Guys Too But i Rocks with Cp3 From The Hornets To The Clippers To The Rockets And Now The Thunder Lets Go Keep This Intensity Going
1,320th comment
OKC has 3 point guards leading the way😂
this is GSW bay area commentator right?
Lord god can we just plan Bruno more at the end we need more rebounds and the rockets shot well this game but don’t want to play defense
Let's go thunder the comeback is real
Love seeing Paul get it on Harden, lol
Not a fan of either of these teams, but what a good series.
I like how okc plays with confidence and patience. Even when houston gets hot and they are down, okc keeps coming and play their game.
OKC in 7
When everybody thought its goin to be a walk in the park for the Rockets🙃
Wow, if Paul beats harden...
Is westbrook wearing #8 Kobe Bryant jersey?
Watching rockets play is boring 😴
Imagine trading for Paul and got no expectation and now has a chance to beat the Rockets in the playoffs. lmao
Who are the analyst?
Will russ play game 5 ?
Dennis speeding around the court like a ferrari
OKC is showing some heart!
Wow. This series has exceeded my expectations.
Can someone please appreciate the great freaking defense of luguents dort to James harden? Yep harden still make 30+ points but hardens just score  when dort switch to other player in pick in roll. Man that rookie giving problems to Houston
Look at this dude Schroeder man, he's putting some moves on a show tonight, I can see a superstar making right here
That boi Luguentz Dort is a decent defender against Harden and CP3 is really a good mentor for SGA
If rockets eliminated by thunder this is the biggest revenge on chris paul's career hahahaha
Based on how the highlights are in this game, I can say that the Thunder's getting their groove back. The first 2 games look like they were adjusting. They have better chemistry and ball movement now. I do hope they can sustain this and even get better in the next games. If they do, it'll be over for the Rockets.
2-2 🤯
Whelp, so much for Westbook resting for the series. You know he'll be there for the next one. No way Houston risks this going 3:2 the other way. Nice work CP3 and OKC.
the best series
Houston and Harden kept raining 3s but fell in the end...OKC and CP3 kept chipping in mid range 2s but slowly won in the end. Slow but steady, wins the race. 2 - 2!
Dennis schroder should win the 6 man of the year not the overrated Lou Wil
Rockets LIVE and DIE by the 3
Matthew 4:4 “Man cannot live off of 3s alone.”
I make rap music y’all might like it check me out🤝💯
I’ve seen this from the Rockets before. It’s called Game 4 and 5 of last year Round 2 vs GSW/and Game 7 of 2018 WCF vs GSW. You’d think after they clunked the 10th 3 pt in a row they’d stop shooting. Jesus. 🤦🏽‍♂️
This is good news. FOR THE LAKERS.
this time rockets regrets those moment that they release capela for westbrook,if the didnt change their lineup,its a 4-0 for them
Go chris paul
Why NBA Highlights Is Always Skipping Like In The First Quarter?
Cp3 ain't playing no games..been my  dude since wake
LETS GO THUNDER
Bruh I’m sorry but harden need step tf up when you gonna get the ring you promising Nd houston ? We keep giviNg u pieces u need and have bro get the job done playing and simple y’all should of been up at least 3-1 all games winnable you not clutch you not build like that harden I’m sorry show me diffrent bro I wish you prove me wrong and I’m from Houston and love the rockets I been following em for years no cap . So y’all can say what y’all want that nigga juss need take over that nigga in half court when the game in fourth quarter critical timing letting house and green take shots like tf bruh
Lmaooo I bet people watching the game on tv thought it was over for the thunder at 3rd quarter
Need westbrook to rescue the rockets😅
never seen so many uncontested lay ups ever. Houston really misses capela tonight
Okc is impressive. Everyone thought they wouldn’t be much without Westbrook.
This announcer sucks
Can we just appreciate Dennies Schroder's game?
LET'S GO
Thunder in 6
it is 3-points shot contest!
OKC vs Lakers in semi-final.
What Shitty coaching to allow them the come back after the rockets had such a huge lead 🤬
Is everyone going to ignore the travel after the steal from Paul from beard at 2:45?
Every1 was sleeping on OKC now Cp3 is going 2 eliminate #Leflop
Rockets had momentum in 2nd quarter then harden shot 3 long contested stepbacks. Just ruined the flow...
Go check my reaction to Dallas winning I promise y’all won’t regret it
Shcroerhrdherder is a baller
Dort fckd harden up
I just hate the way the Rockets play the game. Can't stand it.  It's like they're trying to game the system.
I’m sorry but hearing the warriors announcer call games that aren’t the warriors jus sounds plain weird 💀
Its scary when this team did better than those 3 years with westbrook on that team
If CP3 accepts a 20 million contract next year and trade Embiide, I think they can make it to the final.
Wahahahahahaha.nice okc
who's that guy wearing lakers jersey at rockets' bench?
It's not necessary to force a 3 when you can get an easy 2. Rockets are good, but i don't see them winning more than 2 series this way.
The stupid philosophy of mike d antoni
westbrook injured?
Chris Paul makes everyone better, you don’t have to alter your game to play with him just play hard he’s gonna find you
Just like clippers and mavericks the game it so intense😨😱
Why did it take so long for the rockets to foul at the end??
CP3>PG13 and Russ 👍
They don’t call Houston “Choke City” for nothing! 😂
Another Harden poor playoffs performance
Chris Paul is really a good team leader. Probably better than Russ.
All pj do is sit in the corner
2:45 No defense playing Harding picked Cp3 😲
@:15 James Harden just screams at ref for potential over the back instead of playing defense and trying to block Adams.
Dennis Schroder has an ugly jump shot but it works
I'm a rockets fan an Management messed ths team!!!
Honestly I thought they we’re gonna swept them am not gonna lie but if OKC send HOUSTON Home for me they don’t even have play any teams the win a championship
I’m not a thunder fan but this okc team is fun to watch and I like cp3’s leadership.
Here comes harden , running to the locker room and crying again 😂😂
West brick stay chirping on the sideline
God Bless the OKC THUNDER!!  They're hangin' in there!!❤❤
Thunder up!!!
Adams needs to be more assertive, dude is strong asf yet plays so soft. He just needs to run straight down the court every possession and seal off the defender in the paint, easy layup. The Rockets have no one with that size, I swear modern bigs forget to post up or something, a single hook shot would be deadly.
Bob Fitzgerald? Is that you with the call of a nationally televised game??
If the Rockets blow the series what will be the excuse this year....COVID-19?
4:08 is that’s travel
Woah last 20 secs. Guys check it out chris paul did he travel after the rebound? He stepped twice before dribbling the ball. 🤔
Hey guys check out this video https://youtu.be/OhiJa1N-gxo
i dont like the rockets roster
If Westbrook was playing they would sweep okc
Alix Lynx
Clippers regretting trading SGA for Playoffs P😂😂😂
Dennis went off though damn. Cp3 still got it in him im rooting for okc in this series its gonna be a battle though
Goddamit! CP deserves a damn ring! A legit double-double in his whole 15 year career.. and still putting up numbers.
What now russell say something😂😂
Drains a half court short but not a fucking shot from the three point line.     The most Houston thing ever. 💀
those lead changes tho
Russ has to comeback next game like it or not, rockets can’t afford to go down a game with okc up 3
Okc baby
Well, wow, Chris Paul just has to stay healthy now.
If this doesn't show you that Harden is just a state chaser? Cp3 is a better all around player then that choke artist
anyone else notice they replayed the same free throw at 8:36
Wow Paul and Schröder. Paul had such a really awesome game especially. I think their big guy Adams is dead weight. I noticed he's covering good 3 point shooters and they are just eating him up. Plus not blocking anything. They'd be better off with a little 3-point shooter. What do you think?
Okc and @luthebeast woww the game
Im starting to lose hope for the Rockets
Why is no one talking about OKC and how everyone thought they were going to tank
Rip kobe 🖤
There's no easy match up in the west!
Thunder in7
Rockets gotta stop passing up layups just to kick out for a 3. To many times you right at the rim and pass out instead of laying up. Get Russell back for the next game its time now.
I still want to see Lowry and Paul in the finals
https://youtu.be/ofjfsSgVLWQ
Harden's legacy on the line. If rockets loses it will be definite "Houston we have a Harden problem." and it will vindicate CP3, Melo and others.
Hawks will miss dennis
I am a 23 year old rapper from Toronto, Canada who goes by the name DOV. I recently made a track called "Dying to Live' in support of the BLM Movement. Please click on my channel, give it a listen and let me know what you think!!!!!!!!!!!
It's hard being a rockets fan when they cant deliver.
What a fcking waste of talent and potential. Bball these days all very predicable either shoot unli 3s or set high screen . Very predictable. Harden attempt to drive to the hoop then pass it to open guy on the side to shoot 3 very predictable.
you live with threes you die with threes  - badboys for life 🤣
OKC, don't let that Alexander go, I see future of okc in him. Don't make the same mistake with Harden.
OKC laughing at the Rockets. You thought this was going to be easy. The WB effect if his team gets knocked out again in the first round.
Bkey ganon parang laglag ung laro nila harden
CP3 gonna be HOF right?
it's always good to see the rockets lose.
Where are the people who said after two games that thunder were gonna get swept?
If the okc won .. thats a big humiliation for westbrook
Chris Paul with the Alabama state Jordans on...stand up Bama334💯
Rockets think that they are the warriors! 😂
NBA is racist.....
Its a damn shame however the Rockets will still win the series
Houston not gonna shoot the 3 ball that efficiently next game so OKC should be very confident going into game 5 #CP3
Cp3 can play just as good as LeBron can play only in different positions. He's about the same age as LeBron I believe. He definitely needs to be in the conversation of being one of the greatest point guards of all time.
6:40  Who's that?
Westbrook left the group
Cp3 is a pain in the ass.  What is nice about this match up is because of players from these two teams exchanges.   So exciting to see.
It would be so funny if rockets lost. Two MVPs leave a team just to lose by them lmao
Why don’t they ever let Luguents Dort play? I have a friend that is cousins with him.
Rockets choking
Rockets ain’t ready for round 2.. just go ahead and make that 1st round exit 😢
When russ coming back?
When Paul did the hesi at 1:17, shit was smoooooth
That ending funny as hell
its weird hearing fitz announcing and the dubs are not playing.
Still remember that game where Houston missed 27 threes in a row?
Way to go okc! Cp3 is loving it lol. It’s good cp3 got out of Houston. The way Houston plays they will never get to the conference finals. Harden is a bad dude but who the heck wants to play with a player that over dribbles and don’t pass and don’t play defense? This style of basketball is not fun to watch unless you like iso ball and will never win a chip.
The problem here is Harden and his nonexistent defensive capabilities.
The commentator sounds like goku🤣 Thumbs up who agrees!
i want Aqua man on semi finals haha
Live by the 3 die by the 3 simple.
Is it just me or this sounds like the warriors announcer?
NBA, made in China
The NBA is going down in political flames 🔥
here we go again playoffs rockets. living by the 3s , dying by the 3's...

It's been interesting
Harden only to blame in the clutch
JAMES DIDNT WANNA FUCKIN PASS
Still need two more win come on thunder
Rondo doing pretty good in okc!!
Does anyone know why Westbrook was talking trash to OKC?
Chris paul crossover is still a killer 💀
Lets talk about how Houston can't finish off any team in the playoffs.
Next time on NBA clippers vs raptors
Chris Paul best Point Guard of the Decade
Damn Schroeder is really underrated he looks like a star and plays like one too
COMEBACK IS REAL!
Boss Pashoutout kay Patricia Gaylle Mendoza.
LA shoulda kept Sga
Typical rockets it's either they'll make 3s or not and still defense is rare for them.. 😏😅
While lost, at least the houston guy who throws the last attempt earned a nearly whole court shot for his career stats
I’m sick of all these iPhone ads cause I can’t turn my phone right away
good comeback okc!!!!
Rockets fans acting like the refs forced them to shoot 5/26 from 3 after they started 8/8 in the 3rd quarter 😂😂 #thunderup
The playoffs forces these young players to be grown man
CP3 takeover! About damn time!
Live by the 3 , die by the 3
Rockets are buying time, for Westbook.
Warriors beat Rockets in 4 Playoffs that Warriors' commentator Bob Fitzgerald is so used to commentating Rockets.
Stay humble Thunder back on farm.
is Westbrook coming back
The Rockets drive my crazy. Stop fucking shooting 3s every fucking possession, especially late. Drive to the basket.
I would love to see the look on Russel Westbrook's and James Harden's face if OKC wins this that would be priceless.
How to solve the rockets problems: -Eric Gordon for the love of God dont make any 3s  -Pj man you gotta hustle and stop fouling damn  -Harden we gonna need you to try abit more harder and we need more 3s  -And finally when the hell is westbrook comeing back  Thers more but I just address the major problems go rockets even if they lose i got the mavs on backup lol
Harden loves choking
Chris Paul and Dennis Schroder one of the NBA’s best duos
No one on the Rockets can guard Dennis Schroder
If Rockets lose series, D’antoni is gone, EG is gone and Morey will be on massiv shot seat as well. Moreyball lost us this game
I thought lebron or giannis is d best player now.Paul told me im wrong.
dude this series made me realize how much of a hooper eric gordon is
I found the real playoff p
Lets not forget that the Rockets traded all their future assets  to the Thunder  for Westbrook.
Lets go OKC ⛈ all you gotta do is keep crashing them boards
Rockets needs to survive until Westbrook can play
Rockets and James harden fucking suck.
The NBA need a new “illegal offense” violation that prohibits more than three offensive players outside the three-point line for more than three seconds.  Frankly, the current game, which can see all five offensive players on the three-point line is boring.
Chris Paul is a Legend 🦾
GO CHRIS PAUL
1:47 stevie adams?????????????
Harden and Gordon foot work keeps improving 🔥
If CP takes the thunder to the second round he already accomplished more than Westbrick
Will Russ come back before they get eliminated?
the rockets keep chocking
Cp3 is kind of underrated.
"And if he makes this, what's the score?"   Other commentator: "2 pOsseSiOn GaMe."
Man!, what a come back for OKC 💪
This was very disappointing game, when they shots fall they unstoppable when its not we get reminded why that style don't work, u cant jus keep shooting u gotta switch it up if they not falling drive into the gah damn paint smh
“you live by the 3 you die by the 3”
😂😂😂 Westbrick eliminated from the 1st Round of the playoff continues 😂😂😂
Dort is on fire man on defense in crusial play
Russell Westbrook has left the chat....🤣
🧼
WOW , JUS WOW!!! CHRIS PAUL HAS TURNED THIS THUNDER SQUAD INTO A REAL LIVE THREAT... THA WAY THEY HUSTLE ON DEFENSE & NEVER GIVE UP IS AMAZING , TRU TEAM 🏀
Rockets made all those 3's and still lost lol.
CP3!!!!
CP3
My fellow thunder fans, let’s be humble and not celebrate this win, we need 2 more so let’s be quiet so we won’t jinx anything
Why always win OKC....😡go rockets defeat this team.!!
Rockets needs Russ, because the whole rockets offense is made for Russ
When the shot actually matter James should’ve stepped up and shot the ball last
Westbrook is the  black sheep of  OKC
URGENT‼️Jesus is Coming Soon REPENT Turn from you Sins and Trust/believe in JESUS Hell is not worth It Jesus Loves so muchhhhh Trust in him  and Turn From your SIN God blesses you everyday so why disrespect him and continue Sin follow him this World is Corrupted and Full with Sin and Hatred God Brings True Peace and Joy Try it just Bow down and Pray Release all your Burdens onto Jesus Don’t get Left behind God Bless you Amen 🙏🏽🙏🏼🙏🏻🙏🏿🙏🏾✝️😌🙌Hallelujahs
Chris Paul can win this series.
Bro James harden is pathetic for not shooting the ball
After these two games, I will say the clippers are dumb as fuck
Westbrook is the  black sheep of  OKC
take that advanced analytics
Westbrook is the  black sheep of  OKC
Check me out on the tube ASAP it’s lit 🔥
Yawa
I love seeing Houston lose. I'm not an OKC(or CP) fan, but I really hope they knock Houston out.
I’m back to poke my head back in for all the Hou fans that said it was over. Told y’all billy was gonna make it interesting
🚀 choked again lol
Wow finally getting interesting 😀.....
Damn!!, suddenly we have put away the broom for the sweep and now, we found ourselves hanging on to the rope. #BringBackWestbrook.
Do BLM OR IS IT ALL POLITICAL??? TODAY IN 2020 IN Africa there are an estimated 9.2-million people living in modern day slaverY .. Again do BLM only in ANERICA what about AFRICA??
That Lu Dort  defense  to Harden
dort D is the key
dort D is the key
1:14-1:28 pretty much sums up how terrible the rocket's defense is.
Hope okc win the series Westbrook is toxic
Okc taking out Houston after their team got fleeced would make me so happy.  Idk why, i just really dislike james harden. I like westbrook a lot, but can't stand harden.   Everyone loves an underdog
Lady and gentleman... we have a serie. I feel stupid for saying Rocket are gonna sweep.
Again i saw a shaqtin a fool
Thunder go on a 21-7 run at end of 3rd.  NBA on YouTube: I’m gonna ignore that.
How ironic Houston gets Westbrook and okc gets cp3.. And cp3 gets the last laugh.. Hahaha
YALL ARE FUCKING GARBAGE LIKE WHEN TF ARE YALL GONNA MATURE UP ON DEFENSE AND GET THE MF BALL
Love seeing the rockets loose 💙
Happy for CP3. He’s drawn short straws ever since new orleans
Rockets without Capella ‹/3
Western conf is just too competitive
Houston they own worst enemy.....58 three point attempts 👀🤦🏾‍♂️👎🏾
Rockets win first 2 at home while OKC wins next 2 at home as the series heads back to Houston for Game 5.  Pre-Covid narrative...
For some reason this shit screams rigged toe Eric Gordon wide open three didn’t even look like he tried he just bricks it ....🤔🤔🤔
CP3 legacy is sealed. He's one of the greatest basketball players of all times. championship or not
When Westbrook comes back this will be interesting
So proud of the Thunder, I was so nervous in that 3rd quarter when the Rockets were up 13 and striking them 3s.
Hell. Yea.
Time for Westbrook to play!! Rockets can't take Okc lightly. CP3 is extra motivated for this series.
Houston easily could of built a wall for trump with all those bricks
Westbrook coming back next game watch
Cp3 went back into his prime
WLM
Chris Paul is so mad at Harden at that one time they get interviewed but all of the questions are for Harden... now he wants revenge
I will never trust a Mike D’antoni coached team in the playoffs. He ruined the latter half of Kobe’s prime. He’s not a championship caliber coach.
Thunder got lucky, there not going to play like that no more. Rockets 🚀 In 6
It seems we require Russ right now.
Rockets warriors wannabes fro
Wtf happened at the end!? Unsubbed!!!!
Have you noticed how friendly the rim has been in the bubble? These rums ain't typical or regulation sized. Could be wrong but just saying. No crowd might be a reason too.
Damn this thunder playoff series has the number of wins of a 2 year span of thunder with PG and Westbrick
Houston we have a problem..  ..we've been THUNDERSTRUCK!!
You lived and die with the 3.
If Russell Westbrook played then there will be more Bricks 🧱 !!!
1:59 I swear he travelled there
Okc ☺️🙂
Can someone please help harden like rivers had 0 in 15 min and I am so tired of us missing wide open threes.
Harden is so out of shape.
So noone gonna talk about how schroder has been balling lately?
The Rockets missed 27 straight 3s in Game 7 of the.........
Houston copying GSW all the time and failing. Copied the volume 3pt shooting - failed. Copied the small ball lineup - failed. Copied the multiple MVP lineup - failed.
Makes me smile
Who made that full court buzzer shot for the rockets at the end of the game?
Like I said at the beginning Rockets in 7🙏🚀
This was a very close match
OKC in 6
People were saying it was a sweep hahaha
Harden : I can't win championships  I'm a stat padder  only
OMG CHECK THIS NEW ARTIST🔥🔥 !!!!!! THANK ME LATER 🔥🔥https://youtu.be/UFgpvaZ_0R0
Im loving that shoot clock on the floor... Me Like...
Good game
Well know the clippers have Marcus Morris Sr.,Reggie Jackson and Joakim Noah.
FUCK Alex Morse.....
OMG my man  Schroder getting sixth man this season
Lets go okc...not a big cp3 fan...but like harden and Westbrook even more lol. They dress 2 funny. B glad if they go home so I ain't got to see them ugly outfits they call fashion ..
Let's go Thunder!!!!
I swear these games are rigged like this guy harden has never played softer in my life then today smh I can tell the thunder was supposed to win this one like even tho I'ma OKC fan I can see this shit
Can't believe they underestimated this Thunder team...
OKC man lol The fucking dark horse in the playoffs. I mean, who'd of thought? This team would've made the playoffs, let alone, be the 5th seed? I definitely counted them out! They're definitely the Cinderella team for sure. #respect
CP3 BETTER LEADER THAN WESTBROOK.
I love the Rockets but they won’t win any chip until the office replace Mike D’Antoni with a solid coach that can actually put the players talents into effective use and not just racking up 3s. For some reason I want them to lose this series so Mike D’Antoni can be fired just like the 76ers (ex)coach.
Sam Presti looks like a genius. Look at all those picks he got for Westbrook and Pandemic P. Unreal.
I love these lower seed teams in the west.
There is no defense from Rockets, if I have Porzongis or Embiid or any superstars bigman on OKC, i would sweep the Rockets
Harden :im always choker at playoffs
Schroder is so underrated
Well since Westbrook ducking action Shai Paul and Dylan doin they damn thing 💯
Refs really hate the rockets.
The rockets are playing so bad and the thunder are playing best they can and still barley keeping up.. they better hope they don’t wake the giant
We need you russ
So much for a washed up pg am I right 😉😉 go thunder!
here come the thunder
The rockets woke up the Lion cp3 and his babe lions, they are really hungry now, the rockets got a problem because , cp3 and his squad are in a playoff mode.
2:24 🤣🤣🤣
Only reason the thunder is winning is becaus the rockets are letting them. My thoery is they are letting the games go on giving Westbrook more time to recover. It makes sense because they prob wont make the finals without him
"YOU LIVE WITH THE THREES, YOU DIE WITH THE THREES"  -HOUSTON ROCKETS
Playoff harden never disappoints at disappointing.
https://youtu.be/SBOvPdFnW1A
I believe it going to a game 7
Oh the irony for Russel if the Rockets lose and OKC moves on.
Give credit to Dort!!
Shout out to OKC bruh i told people don't underestimate the Thunder
I'm trying to reach 500 subs before the end of the year help me reach my goal please🤞❤  Youtube-https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCgd0A9wFvFyGI_dyjPE3pMg
What a game!
Okc is def gonna win championship
Houston needs big center. There center is only 6 7
Everyone talking about playoff P don't sleep on playoff Harden
Dort is really effective on defending Harden.
Westbrook needs to return lol.
The Rockets are disappointing the fans. They shouldve swept these guys, or at least beat em in 5, but the bad shot selection and bad decision making is causing these late game collapse. They need Westbrook back, to at least help scoring and rebounding
IT'S THE WILD WILD WEST!
I really thought cp3 is at the end of his career man... I was totally wrong.. thunder actually have a shot against the rockets..
Could have been a sweep
This series is gonna be decided by when Westbrook comes back
Just Imagine what russ would do to okc with pick n roll
Isn’t it funny how the Thunder was supposed to get swept.🤧doesn’t look like that’s happening.
Just ugly stand around 3 point shootin' basketball.  🤢🤮
If only cp3 was good back then to houston as this
Cp3 never get old....
I'm glad they tied up the series  but it's about to be Westbrook off the hook😃
keke....Houston you got a problem....kekeke
Sounds like the play by play announcer for warriors
Not all Paul chokes
Thunder up ! Go Rondo
Nice game
westbrook is spy lol.
Didn't the Rockets learn back in the 2018 playoffs what happens if you keep chucking up 3s?
I just want the rockets to fall so hard then let's see about the 2021 season if there will be a new rivalry
Ads 😥
This game really came down to Eric Gordon. How in the hell you only gonna make 8/24 shots, have 5 turnovers, AND play terrible defense?   Props to the Thunder for getting it done, see y'all for game 5. It's gonna be good.
Honestly I think Westbrook shouldn't comeback and bail Harden out. I don't think he should risk getting hurt in the first round (like KD). To me this is Harden's chance to take over this series and prove doubters wrong.
Isn't this golden state's commentator? Sounds like him maybe tnt hired him because the warriors are not in the playoffs lol
rockets🤣🤣🤣👎👎👎
I had this series going 7 and would not even be surprised if thunder win this series. Harden is good but honestly players cant make plays when it matters the most. And also Westbrook trade in my opinion was not good trade. I felt chris Paul and harden work better together. My opinion tho
wtf was harden doing in the first play 😂? Box out my nigga
CHRIS PAUL SAID HE DOES NEED JAMES HARDEN, WESTBROOK OR KEVIN DURANT 😎👌🏽🤵🏽👌🏽
Nooo
We like those 🌩
Wow thunder! This was impressive gg
How are y’all gonna be quiet when the rockets go 2-0 and then you just go crazy when the thunders won 2 games in a row hating
CP3 What a general still even though he's on the backend of his career. top 2 or 3 pg of all-time in my book
i love the playoffs right now.....cp3 is still the best pg in the game.... harden still has some work to do
Did the score keeper just add an extra 3 points to the Rockets' score at the end of the game?
Houston better close this series out
👏let's go Ock thuder.
Happy Kobe Day 8/24
I hope OKC ends up winning the series. The rockets can't seriously believe they are gonna beat the lakers without a damn big man 😒😒😒😒😒  #areyoudumbstupidordumbhuh
That guy gaurding harden is a problem
Russ we need you😭😭
Not a Thunder Fan but I want them to win against the Rockets
I like how the refs are not calling fouls and letting em play Hard lol
😢😢😰
Well, it would be interesting if they go to game 7 🤣🤣🤣
Mans said stevie adams at 1:50
Wow! I'm impressed with CP3 and the OKC thunder. As a Raps fan, rooting for Shai as a Canadian
Yea
The west is getting interesting. 3 major upset series are in the making.
Lol I remember when People thought this would be a Sweep😂Just Glad this turned into a More Interesting Series
This series will more than likely go 7. Westbrook probably won’t be able to sit out too much longer especially if they aren’t hitting their shots they need somebody to go to the basket
House was probably trying to higher there most 3 pointer attempts but then he made it
Imagine if CP3 manages to lead OKC to the 2nd round CP3 did what Westbrook couldn't do
Let’s get ittttt
Rockets shit the bed. I'm use to it part of being a. Rockets fan, oh well series ties
So I recently been watching the nba even though my warriors are not in so I been recently been watching the nba because why not so I watching and it's actually interesting especially the West the east is just boring to the the nets and 76ers are gone the magic are almost out of here and no one cares about heat pacers series meanwhile in the west side their series are actually interesting the clippers and mavs series is doing really well the Lakers vs blazers series is pretty goddand the jazz nuggets series is OK the rockets thunder series is a good series so since I have been watching the nba playoffs it has kept me away from my non-happy place I have been in during this pandemic
We have to fucking get Westbrook back next game no doubt about it
Can we just trade Westbrook for Luka please, at least he has the balls to play.
Dorts a beast man
Announcer being impress by the international flavor of OKC Mavs:  Hold my schnitzel
say what you wanna say about chris paul, but dont ever say the man doesnt know how to play basketball. he really was misused in houston
Rockets need to shoot 50 threes because if they can't rebound then at least that missed shot a high reward shot.
This is literally the "Playoff Paul" we want.
Rockets are still gonna win the series but not without a fight from OKC.
Chris Paul is a way better scorer then his ppg show. He could at max score 25 a game and still produce his assist but for whatever reason he never did.
Kobe was right, rockets style isnt playoff basketball. Even if they can get by okc theyre doomed to fail. I don't even see d'antoni the same anymore
Wow. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Fuckin getting annoyed af don’t think Houston will even get out the first round now
We gonna win the next game tomorrow.
Rocket: Live or Die, 3-point Forever!
Rockets in 6
What the fuck is up with Westbrook to I thought thay said he Wux gonna play after game 2
Westbrook gotta come back soon. OKC got all the confidence now
8:49 Answer the question lol
At least this year harden can blame westbrook..comon now yall know harden don't show up in playoffs..you know this menggggg
8:43 They don’t even show Harden’s clutch 3. Smh NBA
nice, "full game highlights" and the first one is when both teams are almost in double figures
Live by the three die by the three. I’m gonna laugh if mavs beat clippers and thunder beat rockets.
Yay baby! Hard work pays off
Rockets hot garbage bruh
The fuck see these is that bullshiting as shit thay do I fuckin hate that trash shit shoot 51 threes after only makeing 8 the fuck foreal 10 more shoots in the paint would have been better then 10 missed threes fuckin Rockets are garbage thought we goin to next round easy I guess Oklahoma wants it more the fuck
Hey subscribe to my channel
Name of play-by-play commentator?
Westbrook needs to come back already before it's over for the Rockets
All those bricked 3s in the 4th by the Rockets can build a house
bob Fitzgerald shouldn't commentate on TNT lol he so bad
The Rockets blew that lead lmao, but good win for the thunder!
yeah Russ where are u I’m tired of this shit lol
Bill Donovan should’ve one the coach of the year. He got G leaguer and high schooler playing ball.
All the rockets do is play 1 vs 5 basketball. They never run any offense. I wander what they do at practice
Glad to hear the Warriors local commentator getting work
Who else looked at the end to see if their was a game winner
Love the content! Appreciate it if you can help me hit 15 subs
“Banging and bumping”
I'm not scouting teams
Dennis Schröder  easily wins sixth man of the year award phenomenal performance tonight
If Gallo can play like usual and the rest of them continue to play well okc got this
Horrible officiating 10 ft attempts to 28 fts is the only reason that game was close
live and die by the 3 - rockets motto
Westbrook needs to comeback we are not attacking the paint enough
Peee peee pooooo
That commentator is piss poor at it
what a story Chris Paul and the OKC Thunder are this year.
Yes go Thunder them boys are fight. Let's win and show we got what it takes to win. Let's go to the second round and win. Go Oklahoma City Thunder all the way to the finals.
Ahahaaahaaa Rockets Chokers!  Fuck Harden!!! Cryyyyy Choker 🤣
Live by the 3. Die by the 3.
When Houston made those 8 straight threes I was laughing so hard It was so funny because a 10 day contract Eric Gordon was cooking. After that I started crying so hard because harden thought he was Dame Or Steph tryna shoot from 30 and kept bricking
If you think about It Zach Lavine Is extremely underrated. Donavan Mitchell gets so much recognition when his numbers are Identical to Zach Lavine's. Their play styles are Identical. Although Zach Lavine Is slightly more efficient. I know it sounds crazy but this could be Zach Lavine scoring these 50 point games. But wow Jamal Murray hits a 3 for 50! This is crazy never watched 2 players go for 50! My point Is Zach Lavine is just as good as Donavan. But let me see your opinions. Don't forget Zach Lavine went for 50 points with 13 3pts.
MY TOP TEN NBA PLAYERS 2020 2021 PLAYOFFS EDITION LETS ARGUE😡 LET ME KNOW YOUR OPINIONS! 1 Donavan Mitchell - 2 50 bombs EZ 2 Kawhi Leonard - Better post player than Joe-L Embiid 3 Giannis Antentokounpo- MVP, but stop with the DPOY that's #8 4 Luka Doncic- Y'all gonna be mad at me but those 3 players above are playing Insane! 5 James Harden- No GSW this time lets goooo! 6 Jayson Tatum- Overall might be better than PG 13% 7 Lebron James- #3 Best player of all time 8 Damian Lillard - Come on DAME!! 🕜🕜 8 Anthony Davis- 8/24 game ruined your reputation Lol 9 Jamal Murray- Has his ups and downs but overall playing great 10 Chris Paul- Scoring, efficiently, clutch, hard to leave CP300% out    People who would've made it but got swept so they are eliminated Joel Embiid Nikola Vucevic  Good but not good enough to make the list Nikola Jokic Fred Vanvleet Kemba Walker Jaylen Brown Cj Mcollum Rudy Gobert Seth Curry Lou Williams Serge Ibaka  Players that are playing trash for their role PG 13% Al Horford Kris Middelton  LET ME KNOW YOUR OPINIONS!!
I love rockets.. But i really hate westbrook....  I have very conflicted feelings.
Mr. State Farm himself Chris Paul please Paul know how to stick it to his former teams this sitting right now scratching their heads wondering man Chris Paul got us again
First 2 games:We don't need Westbrook Last 2 games: If Westbrook would've played... Make up y'all mind Rockets fans
It gets retarded when they shoot that many 3s if they aren't landing get into the paint!!
2:23 "OHHH the beard got PICKED" lmaoo
JUSTICE FOR JACOB BLAKE!!!
Covington got cooked
Rockets are breaking records with attempting threes but bricking all of them, like I said rockets will never win with that play style, Kobe has said that about the rockets, and he is right, James harden will retire with no ring if this is the play style they use
James Harden another year another disaster like I said in James Harden Houston Rocket teams I like the Dan Marino Miami Dolphins all talk but no delivery I look like Houston is going home people
0:19 “Kid KIWI” 💪
the rockets is in trouble
9:27 you can hear that firm smack
The rockets gotta get it together because okc has all the momentum right now.
Pleas rokets winnnnnn
Insane
Dumb coach for Houston going to keep playing the same 8 players even tho they tired
Guys guys guys like I said the Houston Rockets are just like Dan Marino Miami Dolphins they would take you through the season look like they bout to win it all but disappoint you when it count most Houston Houston Houston Houston we have a problem
If paul 3 game was lit, he could so be harden but even better, paul could bang a 60plus game if he had that do you in no matter what j.   He just gets streaky and is a pure point guard. Man wish he would just go for 70 plus points.
Rockets are prob gonna get the w next gsme there mad that they lost and they prob will trust me
St. Paul has a mission.
Just sayin..... If Westbrook was in we'd have this
The referee was awful but GGS rockets
Billy Donovan almost fucked it up though
I’m sorry but after this season Rockets need a new coach. How are you going to let your team shoot all those threes when no one was able to knock them down later in the damn game. Congrats on the thunder I want them to win this series.💪
Daily PSA: Sit Adams
Just remember Westbrook isnt playing.
rockets out there looking like construction workers
Luguentz Dort is really a Harden neutralizer
Damn Westbrook isn’t back yet.Rockets could have been up 3-0. It’s it’s tied 2-2 instead.This is a really good series.I don’t know what’s the Westbrook situation here he shouldn’t miss these many games
Lu Dort MVP!
omg they got the warriors local caster. i love this guy
Proud of my Thunder, closing out another close game!
Russell needs to fucking play before we choke this series.
God bless you all. God loves you and so do I❤️ please repent and turn from your ways. Please don’t procrastinate, no day is promised so please do it now. Accept Jesus Christ now as your LORD and Savior and watch your life transform for the better!❤️
Okc didn't make excuses.#ThunderUp
bruh okc finna win, mark my word
So we gonna ignore that full court shot at the end...
If only my Rockets learned from that Golden State game 🤦🏾‍♂️
Once the Rockets FINALLY get past the Thunder, Lakers better be on death con red alert 💯💯
This socks for the rockets because now they might need to being back Westbrook early
To shoot those many three's the rockets still haven't learned it's been years now this formula doesn't work, Brett Brown got fired instantly when is Mike D'Antoni getting fired!!!?
How embarrassing
West Second Round: Lakers vs Thunder Jazz vs Mavericks
Let's go OKC
WHAT WAS YALL SAYING BOUT THE THUNDER
Damn... Looks like home Court matters in this series lol.
Too bad Westbrook didn’t play, Rockets would have won if he did
Wow OKC putting up a fight!
You live by the three, you die by the three
Harden overrated... everyone looks at 40 points but he takes 30 shots or 30 freethrows to get there.. he's not clutch either...
Hmmmm interesting why Westbrook not playing🤷‍♂️
I’m a be honest Rockets really don’t need Westbrook 😕😕
Why does the commentator sounds like Troydan?
Where was the full court shot at the end? I know it didn't matter at the end, but it's still a highlight lol.
Rockets *trades cp3 for Westbrook* Rockets: I think we made a good move Chris Paul: Hold my beer
Lakers vs Thunder lol
Thunder in 6
Chris Paul post game interview talks about beating James harden https://youtu.be/rPWQAGFP9i8
Whoever is Reading this: Your skin isn't a paper don't cut it Your body isn't a book don't judge it Your heart isn't a door don't lock it Your life isn't a movie don't end it it You're beautiful Be you.. Stay safe (by the way I’m also a small youtuber looking for your support )  I didn't create this quote Just wanna spread positivity❣️P
The Rockets are the type of people in Trick-or-Treat who take 3 pieces of candy when the bowl says to take 2
okc prolly win their first first round win in years
Chris Paul and okc are doing so good to keep the team alive shout out to the thunder.thunder in 7
point JESUS really carrying his team on his back. Literally down till they were playing 4 corner basketball at the end 😂 most interesting series thus far
The TV voice of the Golden State Warriors Bob Fitzgerald getting some air time again.
CP3 always delivers at the clutch!
Chris Paul is only averaging 7 APG Per Game so far, but he is still the Point GOD. CP3, Shai and Dennis are a great back court.
Fuckn play Russ
2:44 harden traveled play it at 0.25
Rockets could easily win but idk what the fuck there doing
damnnn 2-2 cp3 might revive his younger game!
Harden sucks, trying to chase the Doncic hype, which he failed.
They really didn’t include the full court shot at the end?
If Westbrook doesn’t play Game 5 it’s over.
Rockets in 6 it's true if Russell plays.
People actually think that OKC can beat Rockets? Lmao
okc defense lockin up
52 3PT attempts holy shit
NBA is finished. BLM is fake.
This series finally got interesting
dang they are so fast uploading
That's it. I'm a Rockets fan to death, but I'm done watching their games. Another 10+ lead blown. Noone can seem to get bucket down the stretch and they can't even make up for it on Defense. We need Russ on the court ASAP. Till then, they aren't going to be on my TV. Props to Thunder though.
Losing Russell Westbrook is playing a major role in the rockets losing the last 2 games right now
Thunder are elite man
Do I need to say that again? It feels like every close game of OKC is a sure win.
Eric Gordon shouldn’t be starting Ben Meclemore should no doubt
Rockets already choking the series to okc not like i didn't see it coming 😂😂
Okc puttin in Work
Waiting for game 7
Dang Thunder still overachieving in the playoffs, got to give credit to them for coming back in this series.
Them Thunder ain't going down without a fight.
Cp3 isane
Rockets are regretting for trading Chris Paul🤣😂
Is it me or house of highlights highlights are better then NBA’s
Russ needa comeback ASAP Rockets too one dimensional without him
Embarrassing.
Maybe this series should get more attention while everyone talking about PG13..thunder making a run for it
Great series
58 thress... thanks houston

OKSHIT
Rockets truly live by the three and die by the three
What a game
Schroder and Chris Paul - the most CLUTCH guards (other than Luka) in the GAME. BRAND NEW SERIES. OKC BABY. TOO CLUTCH. LET’S GET IT. 🌩🌩

First one seeing this
OKC is a tough team. Dark horse of the west.
If u ever get mad over basketball or sad remember...     At least I’m not a Knicks fans
This gonna be a good match up now
2-2 now thunder up!!!!!!
Honestly I really want okc to win the series
How can House make a full court shot at the end but bricks critical 3's all throughout the game??
If the rockets had Westbrook this would’ve been a sweep
Ok 2-2 nice 1 hahahaha 🤣🤣 anyway first to comment here haha 🤣😝
