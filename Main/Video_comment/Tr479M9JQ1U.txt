Bruno lights up the stage, and fills his audiences with emotion, using his amazing vocals. Thanks for sharing, this was fun!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Si no lo es ya... será uno de los más grandes del r&b.
Bruno rizz is the closest we got to Michael Jackson's rizz
Bruno is a giant singer, performer, songwriter, producer, raw talent, unique voice, unreachable entertainer, i can’t stop discovering all his songs. He is underrated by the media, he deserves more visibility. This tiny body is a huge artist!!!!
❤❤❤❤
O Bruno é o melhor cantor  do mundo e só minha opinião importa
Me arrepio com essa pedrada
I LOVE YOU BRUNO MARS 😍😚😚😚
Keep watching it ❤
Absolutly perfect 🤩😍
Bruno is one of the greatest singers of all time. The guy is always good.

wow paul pierce can really sing!😅
The last part of the song is very powerful, to tell his feelings about this song to his fans. The sound waves are swaying, solid, long, soft and deep. It is very difficult for anyone to sing like this. I can never get tired of listening to it.

Jan 2025
People talk about their rizz and humor, and rightly so. But can we take a moment to appreciate Bruno’s vocals from 3.22 onwards? I’m dead serious when I say this may be the most incredible vocal performance I’ve heard. Starts with some elit level belting, followed by an absurdly powerful and chesty high note on “want you baby”, only to follow it up with some incredible falsetto notes and one of the most beautiful melisma runs I’ve ever heard to close out the song. I’ve don’t even know what to say about this man’s voice anymore. It’s mesmerizing…
Anyone  january 2025?

Honestly as a heterosexual male if Bruno grabbed my hand and sang to me like that…I’d probably blush and turn bright red like her too…he’s the whole package looks, voice, stage presence, I was smiling the whole time and I wasn’t even there

👍👍
❤❤
Gostosura de Bruno Mars ❤
Bruno my love🎶🫶🏻
😄😆For many, the world is an amusement park;😅🤣 they want to always live playing, watching movies, videos,🎬🎞 playing games,🎮 others prefer parties,🍺🍻 clubs,🎵 music,🎶 travel, leisure, eating the best, etc, etc. Others prefer to study, succeed in life, found their own company, get married, be happy, etc. They forget that our life here is fleeting, one day we will pass into eternity, they do not seek to know why they are here, what is on the other side when we pass there, they do not care about God, about Jesus. Many even mock Christians, mock😆😆 them, but they are on the right path. God left the Bible,✝ which is his written word, so that all who believe should not perish,😵😵💫 but have eternal life. Come to Jesus, beloved, read the Bible. One day we will all be judged by God for everything that is written in it.😵😭😫
Música linda , uma linda declaração de amor !
1:23😂😂😂
❤
Sydnie…. What a treasure you are. One of the greatest voices. You absolutely know how to deliver a song!!!
Beautiful song ❤and video
Your so amazing Bruno Mars ❤
Caraca! Quer performance

쪼꼬미 친구들은 리드 보컬 떡대 형들은 잔잔하게 코러스 까는게 나만 재밌나 ㅋㅋ
Everytime he sings live,he always give his 100%... Doesn'tatter where and to whom he perform
Bruno has the best voice!   ❤️❤️
Negos doces
Shepherd's Chapel Network !!!!!!! Stay Humble / It's Never Luck !!!!!!! Amen
Porque esse vídeo tem 3 horas?
u can see paak gettin mad at bruno when he gets pushed away by him before singing to the girl
thats how you sing
My mouth is open the whole time……. just… what a voice… 😭💖
tone deaf ass crowd lol
So did anybody notice how mad the other dude got when Bruno sang to both the girls he wanted 😂😂
IT SHOULDVE BEEN ME😭😻🙏🏻
You can just tell at the end that they were really struggling to hold it together when Bruno sang 'big ass mansion door open'. Obviously the music is outstanding but the subtle acting in this is perfect!
2025 Anyone? ❤
Every one's excellent when working together!!
2:25 gurl living the dream 2:33 girl living the dream pt2 2:39 girl living the dream pt3

Nie rozumiem dlaczego taki inteligentny facet mógł stworzyć tak kiczowaty teledysk. Muzyka oczywiście super ale to wideo to koszmar.
01:54  😌☕🚬
Bruno é filho do Michael Jackson
One of the greatest live performance in human history!
Super cool.....

Crazy.
How Sexy does Bruno Mars look with his little fro, being letting nature come through , he reminds me so much of a soulful Billy Joel. He is amazing.
Absolutely amazing ❤

wowww
Did anyone else notice the staged rivalry where Bruno kept stealing Anderson's girl/spot?? 😂 at 3:10 Anderson even makes a face
Aahehehehe
Still amazed ….still a travesty she didn’t win
I believe that this is the closest that we will ever get to Motown again. Silk Sonic is brilliant.  And it's sad that 80% of artists these days are cartoon acts. Thanks for sharing.  #SheisMonaLisa314
now i understand why some men turn gay look at bruno😍😍NO DIDDYYYY
Christ all mighty this song !!!
damn, I was rizzed through the screen
LET HER KNOW ANDY!!!!! 😂
2:38 se fosse minha mulher eu ia perguntar, por que nao comigo? ;0;

0:16 1:54

I wanna be a Billionaire  So freaking bad  Buy all of the things I never had  I wanna be on a cover of Forbes magazine  Smiling next to oprah and the queen Oh everytime I close my eyes I see my name in shining light  A different city every night  Alright I swear  The world better prepare  For when I'm a Billionaire
killed it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
3:07 what was that look from Anderson, cracked me up.
That's a performance! Mad love and respect 🙏
Essa música deveria ter o tempo de duração de uma noite de amor. É uma obra prima.
Как оні в жывую плют это просто вау
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🌹🌹🌹
What an epic live!
Am I the only one thinking this video soundtrack is lower than usual?
If i was that girl I'm not washing that hand anymore
The way I wanttttt you baby
Andy was fire. Bruno was SUPERNOVA!
Why say "hattening" when "happening" is just as fkg easy to enunciate, and it's the correct term? Why do you have to butcher the language? It has done nothing to you.
Amo essa musica
we love this song
ARE THERE FILIPINOS IN BRUNO'S GROUP,  OR ARE THEY ALL LATINOS??. . . .  SAD
Bruno's voice is just out of world, it's sooo smooottttthhhhh like a butter......
Hi  there  Bruno  love  to u how  are you  what  a great  guy  u ❤️ are love  u from  Eloise  in  Baltimore
2:34 bruno mars should've been in the magic mike movie 100%
Paak seems pissed lol @3:07
They channeled that 70's smooth R&B Soul on this one yall 🔥

NOW THIS IS WHAT U CALL A PERFORMANCE
Ce ta maluco q qualidade de espetáculo, ate a plateia é afinadissima...a bando show a parte ...smp curti muito ..#sou fa de vcs❤
Wowwwwwe
Anderson is awesome, omggggg hahahahaahahahahaha crack te shit up round here 😂
Is that Kelly Kapowski?
I'm a guy but this performance made me cry...I don't know why.
Essa obra prima apareceu por aqui no Brasil via internet em plena pandemia. Bruno e Anderson e seus back vocals são demais.
It's been two years and I'm still listening to Silk Sonic 🤍
Coming through 😎
If that lady he approached was me.. I would’ve fallen and will never wake up. This just keeps getting better and better when watching Bruno Mars singing but with rizz
im in love with bruno mars🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍
How are there not more comments about Anderson's little strut talking about the Lay's?  😂😂
Música muito linda, muito bem produzido. Queria que os músicos brasileiros vissem isso e se inspirassem.
Serious question, who is that woman that Bruno Mars approached at 2:34 and sang to.? Is he an actress?
2:39 I would had straight up turned into a tomato, ahhhh he is so romantic 😂❤
2:37 ❤
Shut out to the other guys in the group. They do a great job too. Great harmonizers, easy of the eyes too
La mejor proyección de voz
Bruno Mars and Silk Sonic are the best out there always. Thank you
2:32 I would’ve fainted if I was her 🤣
미쳤다
Who noticing them shoving each other and the side eye going back and forth 🙄🤣
One of the straightest males you will ever meet here. If he grabbed my hand and did that I would have a screemed like a lil girl then made him breakfast the next morning. Don't judge me. 😂
✨✨✨“Imma leave my biggest mansion door open gurl”✨✨✨
👏😁⚘️
Medo da minha esposa ir no show do Bruno e fugir com ele depois. Eu não julgaria pq faria o mesmo
they are flawless live
Bruno Mars Should be Named as the Total Package Guy😢
Tremendo músico
That was to sweet the way Bruno put that lady hand to his chest!!!!
monsters omg!! there are no words to express how amazing they are!
I think the ladies all got pregnant  just by listening
Epic performance ‼️❤️
The smell of Fisherman’s Wharf is apparent even through my iPad
What a golden voice ..
Do a song about how stupid they all look wearing masks
Call me Bruno😂
This audio is to low brow
Increíble !!! Bruno  eres especial para mí y para mí hijo .nos encantas ojalá podamos  ir a verte en concierto . Nunca dejes de cantar y hacer nuestras vidas tan felices !!!! Dios te guarde .❤
KIDS IN 2099 IF YOU'RE WATCHING THIS JUST KNOW BRUNO N SILK SONIC BAND  ..ARE THE BEST LIVE PERFORMING ARTIST WE EVER HAD...
I love how much fun they had with this hahaha

id literally die

The crowd was so off pitch!! 😂😂😂
Best performance ❤❤
Anyone here in 2024?😊
MAN!!! Bruno's mom and his ohana HAS TO BE DARN PROUD!!!!

Wow this audience could not sing, loved every minute of this 😂
❤To me it not just Burno Mars by hiself other other are helping
Paak is a brilliant singer🎉he adds so much at a high level❤❤❤❤❤
Still one of the best performances!
From this 3:25 onward the live version is better than the studio one.
😮
Boa Noite bruno mars  eu Amy  parabéns  todos  para vc que Deus abençoe  vc ❤❤❤
❤❤the guy beside Anderson
❤
🎶
Я русская и обожаю в музыку вашей страны. Я в восторге. Мне нравятся все ваши музыканты и ваши певцы. И прощедшиш годов .м Мне нравятся все ваши певцы,они проффесионалы, я смотрю ваш Голос, и не перестаю удивляться, на сколько классные певцы приходят к Вам. Очень нравится кантри-песня Теннеси Висски, но вместе с тем я люблю всех современных певцов. Не могу всех перечислить, их очень много. Американская музыка очень классная, и певцы тоже потрясяющие. Слушаю вашу музыку каждый день. ❤
2:20 anderson paak is like "yo bruno... i was hitting on her first..." and goes to hit on other girl 3:05 fights for a girl again, anderson paak is like 'daang bruno, stop stealing the girl i'm trying to hit'
Michale jakson

Brah, even my gates, windows, doors are all open 😌
OMG I’M FALLING LOVE WITH HIM……
E foi que o bruninho e comedo de casadas
Anderson was tight that Bruno was literally taking all the girls from him😭

Bruno Mars is a another world !!!!!
2:37 girl, i would faint right away..

3:30 "I'ma leave my biggest mansion door open girl" 😂😂 the rizz this guy has is infinite
Bruno é o melhor cantor pop desse século
The girls in the audience sound absolutely terrible lol
2:31
"If you're hungry girl I got filets."  One of the best lyrics ever!
Bruno Mars is out of are million who doesn't need auto tune ❤
SHE WAS WAY TOO CALM
I'm glad these youngsters are keeping my decade alive! I was born in 1952 and am 71 years old and the 70's was the BEST DECADE EVER FOR POP/R&B/DISCO❤❤❤
É inacreditável a moça envergonhada mais plena gente
This is amazing❤
3:38
i cant be the only one like😭
Voice voice 🥰🥰🥰
Bruno takes my breath away
pourra,  como a moça n teve um treco? kkkkk
i dont know how Bruno stays loyal with the amount of baddies that are falling themselves head over heels for him...😅
Everyone saying how much Bruno’s voice is amazing. Give Paak his flowers too!
라이브 듣고 눈물나기는 첨이네
Passando o natal com a melhor trilha 🎄🎅🏻❤🎉

😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
브루노 마스 미친것 같다
感染力太强了
This performance and song definitely deserves the attention it got bro like this was so absolutely what it needed to be. It was all so nostalgic, but in a way so new and fresh.🥹🔥
legend has it that the 1:22 “uhhhh” wasn’t planned but it went so smooth they left it in the final cut.
no words just wow.....
The best singer in the world nobody can fuck with you bruno😂🗣️‼️
These two are so funny together! I really want to see them in concert. It looks like a party!! 😂
The push at 3:04
2:34 though 😮. I still can’t get enough of this song 🎵
Música show
This is music!
Coming back here again...
This is the quintessential version of this song.
Wow❤

Lucky girl
A versao d pagode ficou melhor
Adjetivo q o talento deles cabe nenhum
Not only brunomars actual song, his performance wherever that's also exciting n feel good.. idk other story
his falsetto is out of this world 3:56
São espetaculares
Homem mais sedutor do planeta Bruno Mars!!!!
If I was that girl I would have lost my shit
Tão sensacionais
❤️❤️❤️❤️🙌
Abençoada essa moça
Bruninho e Anderson se completam aaaa incríveis juntos e o resto dos meninos também são perfeitos
Anybody with a tattoo of Stevie Wonder on their chest, is just fine with me :)
Anderson plays too much lmfao
Os vocais das apresentações ao vivo são ainda melhores do que a gravação. Não canso de ver. Inacreditável!
Bruninho ❤
So talented yet very badly marketed! The clowning part of the living weirdo was a miss! Just being an artist would have done it!
Anderson look so mad when bruno steal his girls😂
He is the modern day Michael Jackson’s
Bruno crushed this shittttttttt
That was incredibly fantastic, and I can't wait to hear more about them.  If I have to put up with these crazy Boogie Men then I just assume get a little naked and enjoy it.  ❤😊
I ain't gonna lie. I kinda laughed when they only decided to cheer when bruno mars started singing 😭😭
no one realising silk looks annoyed? lol bruno takin over the women that silk was singing too lol 2:20 and 3:07
What an outstanding combination   Anderson and Bruno, keep it coming no less that awsome funck
Bruno Mars tem um controle de voz absurdo. Olha o agudo desse maluco, cara!! Muito bom!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This Live Performance Was Stellar!!  You Don’t Need All The Pyro, Background Dancers And Auto Tune To Give a Great Performance.  When You Can Move The Crowd w/Only Musical Instrumentals, Lyrics And Stage Presence...THAT’s What a Great Artist Can Do. We Can Leave The Background Dancers To The 1 And Only King Of Pop!  No One Did It Better Than Michael Jackson...And I Do Mean NO ONE!!
2023
Acho super engraçado essa disputa dos dois 😂
Maravilhoso 😊❤
live or studio bruno mars is sounds perfect
Maravilhoso!!
Лучший!!!
Perro infiel 😾
70s are back
Show
진짜 존나 멋잇다
3:06 why does anderson paak look so annoyed xd
I didn't know that Dave Chappelle sings with Bruno Mars
ptn c’est autre chose que les njr music awards
These guys are toooo smooooooth dayumnn
Both Bruno & Anderson Got best collaboration👏👏👏
Amo muito!!! Eles se divertem cantando ❤
I can’t Even explain How much I appreciate Silk Sonic… it’s magical. All the freaking INSPIRATION from MJ/Jackson 5 I LOOOOOOVEEE. Their music keeps on living through Bruno. Pleeease give us endless amounts of new songs I am signed up for life as a die-hard Silk Sonic stan.
Sensacional!!
Eu
He is the best like how consistently growing how
❤
HIS VOICE AT 3:58 IS JUST CRAZY!
He is my ultimate dream ❤ 2:40 Bruninho 🔥
Carl Anthony Towns singing R&B 😂
Nao me canso, de ver os vídeos  de Bruninho, Brasilllllllllllll
who is she?
Eu simplesmente desmaiaria se eu fosse aquela moça da cadeira 😅😅😅
Brilliant!
“OOoOoooO0000Ooeeee” - the crowd 😬
Idiots with maskes
Eu desmaiava
Live vocals are everything. They give you the real experience and make your money worth it. This is what a performance should be. It's a shame that talented artists like Chris Brown have ruined their careers by relying on autotune.
Music Rizz Wholla choppers Let a straight n- try me
Bruno and Anderson and Silk Sonic Combination is like a Perfect Coffee and Sugar and Cream in the morning ❤
Sheeshhh 😂
Bruninho merece o mundo.. talento puro!! ❤
Mas ele era tímido😂ahhh Bruninho n faz isso aqui no Brasil não meninoooo❤
Como pode tanto carisma, vozes perfeitas, sedução, química numa só apresentação? Chega a ser um crime tanto talento nesse vídeo 😮❤
No 02:37 min, o coração chega a parar. Misericórdia 🔥🔥🙈 q homem! Ele é tao sexy naturalmente. Admiro o autocontrole da querida haha
Love, love, love ❤Bruno
Vevo
melody bruno sing at the end is pure angel
Best song best line at 2:21
Okay Bruno Mars might be a bigger name than Anderson Park but Anderson brought it in the whole album she has swag and not to be disrespectful to his wife who is extremely beautiful but Anderson is very fuck able😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
A moça não infartou, como ela está viva até hoje😮. Te amo Bruninho❤

Que figura o Anderson! kk Esse projeto está maravilhoso, lindo, espetacular!!! Grande, Bruninho! Show!
If I was the one in that chair let’s just say you’d have to physically wrench my hand from that man…
Se o Bruno me olha desse jeito eu iria sair dali no carro do samu mortinha
Idol Bruno mars like a michael jackson..❤❤❤
Okay, we need dream girls part 2 with them ❤❤❤❤
Just noticed it's Jonathan Moffett behind the drums. Epic
Bruno Mars is right up there in the league of Freddie Mercury and Michael Jackson in terms of vocal skill
Noce inglés,pero se escucha bien😂
Me encanta Bruno Mars y este álbum guaoooo las notas altas y bajas ❤❤❤ una mezcla de amor y pasión seducción ❤❤❤❤
"I'M GONNA LEAVE MY BIG ASS MANSION DOOR OPEN" LMFAOO
LEOZITOOO ?
The rizz
Bruna mars has un conierto de nuevoo 😢❤❤❤
She’s never yours, it’s just your turn.
All the women in the audience spontaneously got pregnant just from watching this performance...
Bruno Max  hace música m buena
저 자신감과 여유 그리고 실력과 쇼맨십, 무친 노래에서 나오는 섹시함과 그루브에 게이될 거같다
Great performance
❤❤❤
😍😍😍
3:23
Here in 2023? Damn. Sounds like an old school band. I guess I need to stop listening to reggae for once, &listen to other music. I love this song. Who is  this guy  Bruno Mars?

The pretty young woman they both sang to and Bruno butted in and took her hand to his chest was so sexy and she handled it so adorably. They couldn’t have picked a better woman. The whole performance Was as sweet as that sweet, sweet, woman they included in the song. Bravo. Alleluia and Praise the Lord Jesus and their Mommas. And Daddys. Happy Fathers Day.🧔‍♀️🫶🐕🪺🎤🎼🎹🎷🎺🎸🥁
No homo but Bruno voice send shivers down my spine ngl
능력이 안되나 있는 그대로 노래좀 살렸으면..

Amo❤❤❤❤
Did any of them get Covid?
I fell in love with a man
Increíble como cada canción de Bruno es mejor en vivo que las originalmente grabadas.
São estas músicas, que nos fazem mais felizes, sim, melodia, letra . Tanks Bruno
Maravilhosos sempre show ❤❤❤❤
Perfect voice... ❤ I wish you all the best Bruno.
🔥
“Smooth like a new BORN” was so amazing 💗
If people only knew that this was an example of some of the greatest music in history; Motown. Bruno and Anderson do a great job of bringing that sound back........Bruno reminds me of Smokey when he does a song like this one. Great stuff.
I love you too teddy ❤
How could I miss you at 5am Ted ❤
Damn, Bruno still get it! He was still fine.❤️
Yo man’s looks pissed at 3:07 from Bruno taking his spot lmao
FAN 😍
bruno's high notes like wtf......
Bruno Mars.. what is the name of the girl holding her hand, please give me information
A melhor performance de todas!!!!! Simplesmente PERFEITOS ❤
Bruno Mars is painfully underrated 😢
Now this is music. Teddy, Barry White,  Isaac Hayes etc are looking down with proud smiles on their faces.
I would've instantly died in absolute awe and wonder had it been me sitting there touching Mars' chest.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bruno… E.T….! 👏🏼 bravo..!!!!
I love you too b1a4 cnu❤ teddy darling ❤
Teddy cnu darling I love you please get me drunk ❤

Essa música deveria ter duração de uns 20 minutos. Ela lembra as músicas mais antigas, dos anos 70 e 80, e o Bruno Mars a canta maravilhosamente bem.
Hola genio
Has she washed that hand hmmm
The best song out.
is she still alive? I would fainted!haha
THE BEST
Que hombres tan sexis  me enamore, huy!!!!!

Bruno Mars unmatchable rizz fr
They're pushing each other over girl's 😂😂

Бруно Марс- бриллиант, но как ограняет его Андерсон Паак. Вместе они включают скорость света и улетают в космос.
Im crying.. best thing iv ever seen❤
2:20 That one friend when you pull a baddie😂😂😭😭
There is so much rizz here bro
Nowadays you can hardly find more than a dozen singers that can deliver live AS GOOD AS the studio version,    and then here’s Bruno, who sings BETTER at live performance. 😅🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 I mean wtf man
Singing this good should be a crime😤😤😤😤
Essa música já era linda conseguiu ficar melhor 👏👏👏🇧🇷
Estoy realmente agradecida por estos músicos... son tan completos y sensuales y completos...que representan una bocanada de aire fresco tanto en su música perfectamente interpretada como en sus letras tan sutiles dónde se habla de romance y no solo de sexo y también sus movimientos son muy sensuales y fuertes a la vez ... Felicitaciones!!!

Teniu tan estil que em desmaiaria
This group is something else...We bringing the 80s down in this century! Mad respect
ARTE SEÑORES!
Wow maravilloso 💗💗
The performance! The voices..the swag..the musicianship..the lyrics..the crowd....dang💥💥💥
#MyHappyPlace 🙃 For _a lot_ of us Silk Sonic = happy place! Trust me, I know. 😬 Consistent since the first day they came out!
Tá aqui o comentário em português que você tá procurando.
Que belleza de presentación ❤️❤️❤️que dinámica
Pure beauty ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Essa canção é linda demais!!!
Quem é essa sortuda que ele cantou para ela.
in-sane 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Me encanta...! Puedo escucharla y verla sin parar...!
Great performance, but anyone else also see Bruno nudging Anderson out the way (especially while taking his place in serenading the young lady) and Anderson looking annoyed?
The showmanship in this video is AWESOME.👏👏 Bruno and Anderson's voices together are hot to say the least. Backup singers are doing their thing. I love everything about this.
Shades of the great El Debarge.
앤더슨팩!!! 나훈아슨생님 무대좀 봤구나~~♡
Best first 40 sec to a love song
It's like he's making love through his songs.. Bruno is a genius and a great artist ❤️❤️❤️
Me gusta que Bruno Mars deja que sus compañeros y amigos se luzcan al cantar y no hace diferencias. Canta precioso
OMG Bruno Marssssss ❤️🥹
I remember Covid lockdowns when I hear this song
Amazing! one of 12 top songs of all times.. for me and the interp by BRUNO & PAAK IS WILD!
So damn suave
최고다...
The chosen ones on stage are allowed to not wear a mask, the "peasants" in the crowd on the other hand must wear a mask.
If “every woman in this audience wanna have my kid” was a person…
Bruno Mars is one of the MOST COMPLETE artist of ALL TIME.
Son unos sarpados como van a hacer esa puesta!
whoever edited this video obviously wanted everyone to know YOU CANT SING!!!!! lol... horrible melody from the crowd lol
Canta muito esse menino Bruno Mars.
This is classic and timeless flow bro
Where are you guys now? @BrunoMars
When Bruno hit his 50....it will be impossible for him  to sing this song....He has set the bar sooooo high...that only another young Bruno arriving from Mars can do it!!!!!😅😅😅😅😅
Nce
Everything is perfect until the girl on the front row starts singing
Great work
Anyone else notice the obvious "fuck off" look Anderson .Paak gives Bruno Mars when they're back to back pushing against each other from 03:03-03:10?
😭😭😭🥺💓💓💓💓❤💯🤍💯🧡💕🙊💘💝💖💗
Bruno Mars fóda. Música fóda. Wardrobe fóda... arranjo maravilhoso... leave the door open
Bruno's rizz at 2:34 is absolutely astronomical
I clicked in the video cuz i thought the man in the thumbnail was kevin hart
❤
I hate when they let the audience sing.
When the crowd tries to sing along at the beginning you can hear they clearly aren’t the best but they tried it 😂
마스형 개간지야ㅠ
Bruno got W rizz
Ребята,вы такие молодцы,просто супер ваши произведения это космос!!!!!!!!!
미쳤다.
Браво!!!Что не говори,но западная музыка даёт такую жарку что душа поёт...всех с наступающим новым 2023годом..любви и крепкого здоровья.✌️🇰🇬
Bana here’s my new years gift for you 💋 B1A4 ❤️
No words to describe Them...but Bruno should stop smoking at once! Smoke is not the best companion for the vocal cords.

Why does everyone in the crowd sound the same
Все равно на недоделанного похож...
I love them together.. congratulations 🎉❤
Правильно сделал что усы отпустил Бруно....а то на бабу был похож....

These women are wetter than any of the bass I've ever caught.
I don't know about this Anderson Paak person, don't understand this connection and why it was necessary
Fell in love with bruno mars ever since but his vocals in this song is on a new level. So lit :⁠-⁠)
bruno rizz
Why the hell are all of the comments about Bruno when Andy is RIGHT NEXT to him? They’re both great but still…
3:25 my favorite part 😭😭😭😭 INSANE!!! and his smile.. My heart melted down❤

Nos brasileiros amamos Bruno mars,o artista mais completo de todos os tempos.
I am amazed at how they have recaptured that 70s sound and it translates, WOW!
If Bruno ever puts my hand on his chest like that, they are gonna have to use the jaws of life to remove it!😊
Much Love To everyone who likes and love Leave The Door Open thank you so much and Blessings 👋 Adrian Ace Boston .🎸

Bruno sheesh, that boy can sang!
What a performance…I smiled all the time.

Bruno Mars Silk sonic and Anderson these guys are the best
The thing is not only the range and flair of his singing which is obvious  But he’s so passionate about singing every damn note it’s obvious he lives for this Beautiful
Felt agitation there. If not,  my bad..
Dear Bruno you are the king all alone! the ones around you,  they just stay in your shadow...
Gran canción, pero no se si estoy equivocado o mal interprete las cosas pero en el minuto 3:03 cuando Anderson esta cantando pude notar que Bruno lo hizo a un lado y se puede notar en la cara de Anderson que estaba enojado.
do i look like him?
Clearly one of the best male vocalists ever and he's not even struggling while. Such a crime to sound this good on live, thanks for this brilliant performance Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak and of course Silk Sonic!
they are not singer,they a fcking performer!!!
The collaboration of Bruno and .Paak is the best thing since slice bread.
Anderson at the end with the air drums! You know they had to pull him away for that drum set!
I like this!!!
Oh my goodness! How simple and yet it has everything...
I live for how extra af Anderson made that moment ❤😭 like OKAAAY!
💜💜💜💜👑💜💜💜💜💜
love this
Makes me fall in love again 😋😋🔥🔥
What a beautiful "old" voices!
These guys are magic!
Best duo since Lennon and McCartney
bruno marry whit meeeeeee seu maravilhoso, docinho de coco
I smiled throughout this whole damn performance 😍😍
who is she.....  ㅜㅜ
Panty dropper right here! FACTS! 😆
Brillante presentación 💫✨de lo bueno lo mejor.... magistral
Was Anderson & Bruno having a playful ruffle @ 3:05 - 3:08?
윽..내심장..
Those girls screamed louder when they heard biggest mansion door open , its nice to be rich

the audience sounded like a middle school choir  😂😂
I love when Bruno was getting ready to sing and Andy kicked in. Bruno’s face 😆
🌷
Koi hindi me sunayegi is song ko
Bruno was laughing when Andy messed up that "...ooohhhhh" part. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
muito safados! Adorei!!!
Yessssss👌🏿😘❤️❤️❤️❤️
Crowd with  mad vocals for back up singing
Just WOW....! Beautiful 🥰
うますぎる
Se essa guria não se melou td eu sou um papel toalha
❤️❤️🔥🔥❤️❤️
I totally get it why folks aren't allowed to use copyrighted content for their reaction videos, but you you guys are slaying the game in such a way that it's just fun to see somebody else react the same way we all did the first time. Trust me, we're all buying the music 🙂.
How they can make something so clean y great
in -freakin-credible!!! Awesome range on this guy!  Bruno the great!
Bruno vocals are absolute Fkn insane
that crowd couldn't sing if their life depended on it, which is why concerts suck, artist letting idiots sing
Que moça sortuda, ter a honra de passar a mão no Bruno Mars,  eu não lavava a mão nunca mais, meu Deus.....😍😍😍
This is really good! More of this Bruno!
Nafiz ohh nafiz mana hang
They too smooth
Esto es lo mejor de lo mejor !!!! Me encantan
🇧🇷👏👏 Simplesmente Espetacular!!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
This man is literally the next Micheal Jackson when it comes to preforming and hits period and no one wants to admit it
Bruno's mic isn't even near him half the time and he sounds louder that way HAHAHA I'm the most jealous singer right now and I'm not mad cos his voice is arguably the best I'll ever hear/witness in this lifetime and I'm 110% here for it :D
The best group ever!
La forma de agarrar los microfonos es muy mala, eso da a conocer lo expectacular de ingeniero para dar una precisión de sonido  perfecta ❤️

I would’ve pulled the Kevin Hart pass out, if Bruno had put my hand to his chest. 😂

Bruno and Anderson, what a duo. Their voices and harmony are simply incredible and not forgetting the back up men. What a collaboration. I couldn't stop smiling with the little joke by Andy.
they are too amazing - belting it like that its outstanding
whats the @ of the girl they were serenading
They have such good chemistry I love it
They're are so good,unfortunately 4th impact of the Philippines ,all girl group has a better rendition
Bruno mars is so fucking underrated
bros prolly never slept alone imo
look at those vocals no preservative added
carai biri dim
A melhor performance deste seculo até hoje
Singing in a masks... facepalm...
아침에 출근하면서 들으면 기분 좋게 하루 시작. 이런 바이브르를 만들어 내는 재능이 부럽다
bruno cut anderson two times flirting with a woman, look at anderson's face lol 2:22 & 3:06

I wish there were more bands and performers with the same quality as them.
that high note Bruno soooo impressive 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This music makes me happy
I’m bothered by the fact that the crowd was singing out of tune
-
Meninos lindos arrasam. 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷

❤❤❤❤
Eu amo vocês, AMO MUITO VOCÊS
Te amo Brunito<3

My dying wish to see Bruno in person omg
😍 I love them, the vocals sick, and don't get me started on their wardrobe 🔥
Is just me or Karl Anthony Towns is in d house y'all!!!
They seem all so amazingly happy doing their performance!! And that first girl is so amazingly blessed!
This generation is so lucky to have Bruno Mars!
Love the singing and performance, but the audience with the mask wearing is killing me personally (look like they're performing to some sick patients)
Anderson better stop with all that before I come find his fine ass😘
Voice like velvet
Out here just imagining bruno singing to my girl and I end up blushing instead of getting mad. You are a champ Bruno!
I mean... seriously..  These mofo's are bringing it back!
Bruno Mars' voice is Amazing
It took them 10 yrs to pull this off. They waited for the right time.
I just LOVE ❤ the competing 🤩😍beautiful  at the end as always Bruno.
Bruno and Andy are just great.I love them both.
Bruno mars is maestro 👍
damnnnn Bruno
It took me 10 replays to notice Bruno continuously cutting in when Andy is serenading a lady
I just feel so in love listening to Bruno 😍❤️😘
Silk Sonic. Super Bowl Halftime Show. Now.

These guys are such talented musicians and performers, normally sing alongs are cringey and insighting the crowd can be detrimental but these guys perform so well im singing along in my chair at home when they encourage me too :)
What I like about them is,they seem to be having so much fun working together. I like to see them do one more CD before going their own way
3:59 angelic
Modern day motown with a 2022 twist gotta love and appreciate it
Who are the other two guys in Silk Sonic? I need to know their names! Excellent harmonies
Bruno Mars' voice sounds like it was recorded in a studio
One of the best booty call song ever created!
❤️
Bruno is the Michael Jackson of this generation

Bruno & Anderson on 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Take that beiber! Finally, we have some hope for fabulous music!
These guys are just fabulous
All women want to feel what that lady felt with Bruno near her.  That’s how you keep your lady interested and happy. So simple.
Anderson Pak and Bruno force to be recokned with ... Classic son and timeless
Soul music baby
Love how both sings and looks at the one girl sitting ❣️
3:07 Anderson looked pissed lmao
Drop at 1:55 was too clean💯
What did he said on 03:30 ??
Hopefully Andy will ditch the wigs and go back to his hats. He was so sexy.
WOW, So amazing, Click here to listen to more Bruno's great songs 😘❤ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDvS1RABlLQ
I’ve scrolled through the comments and it looks like nobody noticed how Bruno kept stepping in front of AP singing to the women Andy was singing to first and Andy walking off to the next chick and Bruno cutting in on him again 🤣🤣🤣 Pure gold these two are
I wonder what Justin Timberlake is thinking and what his next move will be🤔❤️
What a talent! And a musical humorful gift to us all. Thank you so much for being there. Your music and performances makes my heart smile over and over again. The colaboration of you two is precious and brilliant. Just brilliant. Love it!
The entire group fabulous.  Their voices complement each other so wonderfully.
So glad to see this band. Takes me back to the sixties. BTW  I'm from T O. Toronto radio swam in R and B in the 60's 70's and eighties. The Temptations, Supremes, The Chilites, The Ojays. That's why Drake and the Weekend are so huge. But it's all about the group. The choreography, the harmonies. .... amazing stuff.

One thing I love about bruno mars is that he can uplift anyone without stealing their thunder. Anderson is shining bright right now. Not saying hes not before. Now we know that anderson is as talented as bruno mars. He just need more exposure. ❤️
I’m so glad they have fun
Não consigo parar de ouvir.
Every taken girl was single that night.
大袈裟な表現であるかもしれないですが、すみません…、わたくしChikoto Nagaya ＝長屋千琴はSilkSonicのBrunoMarsさんとAnderson.Paakさんとバックメンバーの皆さまは、心の情熱❤️‍🔥を込めて歌を歌い上げることや楽器を使って心を込めて楽曲を演奏なさいましたり、優雅で美しくしなやかにエレガントにDannceを踊り上げるために生まれて来られたのではないでしょうか？まあ、間違いなく私は誇張して、感想のコメントをかなり大袈裟に＝オーバーに書き記しましたが、それぐらい、なんの非の打ち所がないほどに完璧で素晴らしく上手であるなあとわたくしは思います。
We don't talk about Bruno no no no
the most talented person ever live
Congratulartion
Anderson is a natural ❤
A música de 2020 p eu. Demais
Those girls must be really lucky :))
MANO O BRUNO MARS CANTA DEMAISSSSSSSSSS
Will say this. Bruno is one of the very very few modern artists who can do it live and do it studio and its sounds incredible.
I don’t even know who I am anymore after listening to this. This is the best song I’ve heard in my entire life.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🏆
why does audience sound so good tho
Anderson Paak made this performance his own.
A partir de hoje 🤧 a porta está mais do que fechada seja pra quem for 💔😔🤧
Anderson Paak, WoW!!
🔥👍🏾💯😎🙏🏽🙌👑
Esse cara é extraordinário, tem umas 5 versões dessa musica ao vivo uma mais bonita que a outra. Mas nessa, ele tava mais que iluminado, slc!!!
HOW???
Самая сексуальная и нежная песня всех времён и народов,  обожаю🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰💋
Who is that girl at 2:32 ....wwooaahh!!! 🔥😍 It's like i have seen her somewhere.. maybe 🤔
This is frfr 💯 🔥.  Prince and Sam Cooke are looking down and tipping their incredibly stylish hats to Silk Sonic..

Hey you all I wish I knew this when I was younger but I have to share this with you that : hey darling you yes you....I have good news. The greatest love story ever told in history includes you! Jesus Christ  loves you that’s how special you are to Him.He is real.He sacrificed Himself so that you could be with Him forever in Heaven. You are so loved!If anyone rejects you disappointed you His love is unfailing and real it never ever changes regardless  of your mistakes. God Defines His Love For You. God’s love is far superior than mankind’s love. It is deeper, broader, higher and completely fulfilling. It’s a Great Love!His love is greater than all your sin. Jesus Christ is ready to forgive you today if only you will accept His love. It’s a Saving love.  God is not the problem. He is the solution! God went far beyond declaring His love for you. He proved it beyond a doubt. Never has there been a greater demonstration of love than the sinless Son of God dying for sinful man. You have nothing to offer God that He needs. You have no way of earning your way to Heaven. All the good Do you believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross to pay for your sin, was buried, and rose again? Will you believe on Jesus Christ today and accept Him as your Savior? In faith believing in your heart that He will keep His Word, ask Jesus to forgive you now. You can pray something like this: ”Dear Lord  Jesus, I confess that I am a sinner and that I deserve to pay for my own sin in Hell. But I don’t want to go to Hell. Today, I accept you Jesus as my Lord and Saviour. I believe in my heart that you died on the Cross to pay for my sin and rose again from the dead. Please forgive me of all my sin and take me to Heaven when I die. I am trusting you alone as my Saviour and you alone are God. Thank you for loving me and saving me from my sin. Amen.” If you asked Jesus to save you today, let me know so that we can get you more information to help you live the exciting and abundant Christian life. Salvation is the beginning of a brand new life for you in Christ. He will never leave you, nor forsake you!michelle.stokesy@gmail.com  we would love to hear from you email us !!!

It’s always a pleasure to see Bruno and Andy. They are so wonderful and respectful of each other as performers. I wish Silk Sonic incredible success. This song is classic already. 🔥❤️❤️❤️🌺
Nathalie Kelly so gorgeous. Whan Bruno Mars put her hand on his heart that is so sweet
Bruno Mars is my short king, My God I felt it in my lady bits when he had the lady touch his chest. And Anderson is just as phenomenal as Bruno. Wish they can be given a chance to perform at superbowl.
Anderson's moment was sooo sweet. Good addition to this performance.
The best album of 2021
Anderson paak has soo much soul😩😍
Fr
EL DEBARGE NEEDS TO DO A COVER OF THIS.  !!!!!!!!!!!

Somebody please put Anderson Paak in a movie  🎬  This dude is all kinda funny and dramatic. But don't let the movie interfere with Silk Sonic's touring please and thank you.
We are witnessing a timeless group that will be remembered as one of the best in the world
Sensacional! 💥
What a perfection 😍😍
Andy seems like he would be a blast to hang with
2:52
Like this show Bnm n' ads p ltn fr. Thailand
Hopefully his tickets are not a pound of flesh like they were for the last tour so I can go see him
Bruno Mars is the best talent of this time.... Strong and angelic vocals... Piano, drums, guitar... He is a phenom 💜 And his parents must have made him listen to the same music mine did... There music is my music
Weird ka talaga Al yankovic. 😁😁😁
They’re too funny 😂😂 love that they have so much fun on stage!
I like Bruno. Original and  they write  songs  with  substance.  Old school  flavor.
Who ever girl is that whose hand Bruno held she is not your girl anymore😂
That girls chair is soaking wet
Anderson is a thug lol
the lady in the front had her dreams come true
The girl that Bruno was touching what’s her name 😳
“You wanna see 1000 women get wet at the same time?”
This performance is flawless. Anderson Paak looks real upset that Bruno upstaged him at 2:20 and then again at https://youtu.be/Tr479M9JQ1U?t=186

“Leave my big ass mansion door open”-Bruno

Smooth dudes!,

Now that's my kind of music that Bruno and Anderson sings.  Love how Bruno hits those notes with voice control.
2:20 Anderson .Paak is annoyed as hell
Bruno Mars & Anderson .Paak/Silk Sonic! 🔥🔥🔥
Two incredible voices, beautiful, filling each other, amazing..
Unreal

Perfect 🎶♥️
Silk Sonic New Super Group I mean Super Collaboration with Mars and Peak killer
For all my 80's babies this the music our mama's played. That's why we gravitate to it like we do. We understand this is the bow that finishes the gift to pass on to the future. "Live" in the time your here. Don't harken for yesterday or tomorrow. Your time is Now.
Did Andersen get mad at Bruno when he jumped in front of him twice?😍😂
I really appreciate what they're doing... what's missing in R&B is the SEDUCTION...
❤❤
hope bruno makes more stuff like this from now on.
Christ this is so sexy......Bruno Mars is amazingly talented!!!!
Can't wait to see them perform in my city in Sept 😍

Anyone else see that Bruno Mars stepped in front Anderson TWICE and cock blocked him!! And see how pissed Anderson was getting!!
He truly is one FULL half of this duo.  Bruno may be the “Silk”, but Anderson is fully the “Sonic”!  His voice is so good.  These two together are entertainment gold.
That's good it was fun
I've always loved Bruno for this energy. Anderson. Pak has always been next level with his singing and performance. I'm so happy they teamed up. They bringing the old school vibe back in a new way and I'm here for it ALLLLLLLLL. Pak is just legendary with his comedic presence. LOVE IT.

Amazing performance...and yeah...when the guys performed "Leave The Door Open"...EVERYONE was dancing and singing along...! Please Silk Sonic...make more love songs like this one...!

Bruno + Anderson= delicious toffee caramel Vanilla Ice cream, sweet and   refreshing... soo addictive
Damn
WOW, BRUNO IS AMAZING!!!
they should make a rat pack and let Raphael Saadiq join!
Hát thế chết con gái người ta
Brilliant
Ok
Bruno you are an awesome artist you make beautiful songs you remind me of my second born I really wish I could meet you in person I know you're married and I'm not stepping on anyone shoes although you really are an inspiration
The all time great performer
I just don’t like that Anderson guy
Bruno Mars and Anderson jesus loves you very much! Sing to him and not to the world!
The girl that bruno sang too had her eggs dropped and got pregnant when bruno put her hand on his chest. Hahaha
All I heard is the voice of all goddesses on the ground
와~~~~~~~~~
fact: they are both half asian
i wish i could hear this without the fucking fangirls
Thanks lockdown👏🏾👍🏽
🙏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🏆
Che dire UNICI❤️💐
They all grooving this song
No one noticed the Bruno was trying to steal every girl Anderson Paak went up to. Dude was like "Really my guy we got all the bitches and you still going for mine haha 3:07?". That's how you know they are having fun with it
Idky but to me Anderson looks funny asf in reaction to Bruno coming in every time
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I ABSOLUTELY love Bruno but for some reason he looks sooooo extremely handsome and sexy. I’ve always loved him behind the piano. Maybe it the shade ( glasses) the body movement…..🔥🔥don’t know but that scene sure looks handsome in every way  Can’t say he cleans 🫠😂🤣😵‍💫😵‍💫👏🏼👏🏼up well Because he ALWAYS is sharp. Maybe the suit 🔥🔥✨✨🤭🙃🎶🎶
@2:38 this nigga got that bitch...it's over she's🔒in.  🤷🏽‍♀️💦
and some people say that zayn malik is better than bruno when singing high notes,,y'all living in a fantsy world...
In the studio there's technology and talented people at the disposal for the best in the business to package and sell. But its performances like this that separate the best from the exceptional. 👌 🎩🎩
Absolutely brilliant
We don’t talk about bruno no no no 🤜🏽
lol i love this performance!
keep play it...everyday...
Everybody talking about how good their voices is, meanwhile i'm dying because anderson mad because bruno took the girl he wants to sing for  Ps: it's at 3:05
One of the best duo hands down
i love u Bruno mars
Omg! That girl is so lucky! Can you imagine Bruno serenading you and then placing your hand on his chest to feel his live heartbeat? 2:37 Crazy experience I'm sure she will never forget!!!
Anderson Paak play all day 😭😂😂
Bruno Mars can sing his ass off. Love love love 💕
Love this tune♥️
Man do the Roney Boys do a good job with this one. They sound just like y'all. Amazing.
At 1:27 - came straight out of the 5 heartbeat. And if you know, you know!
I don't think I will ever get tired of this live performance!  Sooooo goodddd.   .
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
The song its sexyyy 😍
I love this song. On repeat!
Come back here every couple months cuz this song and this performance was absolute GOLD.
Heerlijke muziek ,,thank you.!
fall in love with Bruno❤
I LOVE YOU
Happy-go-lucky
0:24 them 3 asian girls, imma leave the door open
Jackson 5
I wanna be that woman’s hand touching Bruno’s chest
Anderson pack is a half korean blood. His mother is an Korean adoptee
Im late because i dont look at the dates but i swear to god this is on my birthday
Bruh these two pure comedy too when they perform lol
The Best
They sound good together but Bruno was doing his own and he sound good then but together they keep writing they bad together
When are you guys going to do a concert in Canada
OMG....still in 2022....the anthem that got us through the lockdown blues....
They just made old school popular again!!!
Just amazing
GOOD VIBES ONLY 🤭💜✨✨✨✨
See, this is the level of RnB Chris Brown should’ve been at by now. He is still great but he hasn’t grown to this level of great. I really wish Chris would give us a version of his true potential in RnB & Soul by now. Performance wise & Acoustic
We got a 3312 we need a bucket for the lady over there.
Whoever dressing this boys up, damn so good!
lol around 1:57 -1:58 they just dropped the crowd sounds then bring them back when they need to create excitement.
아니 이게 뭐여 미친노래다
Unglaublich wie er singt.....naja einfach unendlich gut
The fanatical stinger prognostically label because carp progressively bury despite a tangible wasp. xenophobic, marvelous deborah
Anyone knows who is the brune girl that appears during 3:26 - 3:40? No words
Man cmon man. Stop playing man. One of the best written songs in 40 years
So no one is gonna talk about how these 2 men 🙄 were about to have a tag n war on stage... Twice i saw these men shoving each other n the other person end up walking away....
Am i the only one who thought Anderson was mad at Bruno when he got in his way to perform in front of the ladies? The moments are at 2:18 and 3:02
I love the showmanship.love bruno
Best combination in the music game rn.
Love you Bruno Mars
God is coming back soon pls all repentt
Bruno , e o cenário.
Love Bruno Mars 🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍

That's 4 for 4. A clean sweep........
Silk sonic new old school music
soul music! i really miss this type of sound! bring back the 70s Bruno!
Guy went a note higher
i come everytime for the sip sip girl 0:23
Omg awesome clean vocals I love him 😍
Bruno's voice is so soothing.
2:37 This is the moment she slides right off the seat.
These guys are literally the existing time travellers of music. They are bringing the past era of music to this era of music while blending with the modern music. This is the only 21st century music I could also listen to all the time. Please continue!!!🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️❤️❤️
Who were the lucky women on stage, sitting in the chairs?
Hot damn Bruno SLAYED that, what was that ending run?! Very good, the whole performance!
Let's go Bruno
Purple One would be be smiling
When the audience wants to sing "shit your trap" so bad even the masks cant get in the way
Iconic!!!! Get it BA!
Justin Bieber must be going DAMN that Bruno sounds so good Live!
They Haven't MISSED YET! 🤗🤗🤗🤗
Go Ahead Y'all 😊
Is the girl they serenade kelly from save by the bell?
Every album needs a stripped version
Bruno hair thou 🔥
That fire!  We woman. miss that kind of. performance. No man had his ass hanging out
Also Bruno`s vocals from 3:23 - 3:43 are absolutely incredible....just simply awesome, wow!!
Now a days you can’t touch the chicks in the audience with out them sighing a consent form because that can be considered inappropriate contact and be open up form legal action and press conferences on how you took her power that day when you put her hand on your chest as she cries recalling the incident even though she was all smiles when it happened I’m just saying 👀
Damn they did that
if there's a God in music right now???its bruno mars! u will always be my music! just wow! proud to be filipino again sir bruno!
Love you both just forget the rest of your band Bruno. Andy got a few pounds on and Bruno lost a few pounds. Your both great and congratulation
Noww thisss isss musiiccc

Guys i cant get over that moment @1:55. Everyone was in sync. So much talent, hard work and charisma going on. AHH!!! It's been what almost a year and this still gives me chill.
As a 70's kid, brought up on THE 3 Elements...Earth...Wind...and. This shit is genius, Bruno. You hit on generations here...in 2022! Check the Soul Train Awards with "Fly Like Me"...there's Sly, EWF, Hip Hop, all rapped up in that joint. Special.
I will never ever get tired of this song. EVER.
Goosebumps
💯The Best‼️🎼🎼🏹❤💫🙆‍♀️

legends says that the chair where that girl was sitting is still wet to this day
Esto si es musica.....¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
Man! There's nothing better, these guys are it!
Smoothest transition ive ever witnessed these guys are unstoppable forces when they're together
Bruno shove Anderson at 2:23 lol
Bruno I love u babe
My mom says Bruno Mars is sexy as hell
GOAT'S
anderson es un semi dios.
if im that girl, i would die right on the spot
Great song! Now it needs to be covered by two women. "Smooth like a newborn" will take on an entirely new meaning ... :P
Top
Bruno keeps gettin better. One of the greatest of all time
Sem maturidade para Bruno Mars
2:38 , olha esse cara mn kjjkkkkk
Legend said that girl got pregnant after this show
In this performance everything is perfect ❤️

Amezing ❤️🥰
O cara é foda
2:20 - Não consigo lidar com o Bruno Mars. Não consigo.
I like this stage the most. Everyone so happy
Fantastic!!!
Hoy! Abot dito sa pilipinas yung kilig nung babae! Bat ganon?!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Michael jackson: - I'm so proud, son 😂
the backup singers tho 🙏🙏🙏
Andy is always playing the drums. He is air playing the drums during the final note at the end.  LOL
I so love Bruno😘😍🥰❤
Anderson, Silk Sonic and Bruno Mars such perfect harmony and class! When these guys sing and dance, it's impossible not to sing and dance along with them! It feels like a massive great party! Guys, Leave The Door Open for more amazing and talented songs like this love song that brings the best in people together!
Bruno mars is out here looking like Hector Lavoe
Just ❤️
Andy brings a lot to silk sonic but that tall one is good eye candy check him out ladies
He said I won't bite unless you like ok paak leave the door ok BRUNO REMINDS ME OF THE KING OF POP enough said.
this song gives you the 70's vibe blue magic stylistics dramatics whispers and we can't forget about those tempting temptations  period!!!!!!
" HÁ PORTA ESTA ABERTA GAROTA SE ENTRARES JAMAIS ENCONTRARÁS A SAÍDA DO MEU ❤❤❤❤ JOGUEI A CHAVE FORA NAS PROFUNDEZAS DO OCEANO ⚖️❤🇧🇷❤🇧🇷⚖️ CGDA RJ 69 PHD DO AMOR FOR EVER "
Bruno Mars is so talented, appeals to so many ages!
What a beautiful, masculine, sexy force of nature!
Name of the girl to whom Bruno sings?
They should just do a complete unplugged version
I would like to dedicate this song to someone, but I'ma leave the door open so you can dedicate it to me...
I love this song
Amoooooo, ele canta com a alma, sente o que canta, a música ganha vida
Watch the Newest hit from Adele feat Bruno Mars  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAZvjGkEMxg&list=RDxAZvjGkEMxg&start_radio=1
mask wankers following the PLAN DEMIC
hi Bruno Mars
A mulher quase morreu ksksks
Yes i now is the best in this generation
rooots
I definately agree.
That swag!!! Yes Yes!!! 🔥 🔥
브루노 라이브 왜저러냐...미쳐버리겠네
Amoooo esse cara.....
The Audience in masks lol. The artists no masks. No Scientific evidence on masks. But Mr Bruno and Co no masks. Special.....
Bruno Mars não faz música ruim. E o vocal então maravilhoso
The bit when Bruno seranades the woman in the audiance, takes me back to Micheal Wright from the Five Heartbeats when he's singing a heart is a house of love.
He is a gift from god
I agree. Haven't liked music for years. Not like the 70s..thank u Bruno. Something to look forward to in future. He's the new mj
Lebron can sing!
😍😍😍💚💚💚
Love Bruno Mars❤🥰 Bravo maestro 👏👏👏👏👏💐💐💐
Man these guys coming  together is just iconic !! A masterpiece of pure perfection !!  🥰🥰🥰 Bruno is just ridiculous . There’s no one else like him. ❤️❤️
Okay... y'all had me with your "Fly As Me" performance at the Soul Train Awards... Then y'all sang that smooth remake of ConFunkShun's song Love's Train... And I see this performance... ❤❤❤❤👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽🎙🎶🥰🥰🥰🥰
فاهموووني قولولي 😍❤️‍🔥
I love Bruno Mars ❤️
am i dreaming or they were fighting for the spot haha
Omg what a performance
Alguem do br
🔥
2:35 / 2:45 is just so cute I’m jealous lol
I wish I was ter
nakakainggit naman yung kinantahan at hinawakan ka pa ni bruno mars. te ako na lang😭😭😭
i constantly come back and watch this the energy is amazing, makes me so happy😭😭
딱 요렇게 호주 브리즈번 한번 와주시죠? I'll leave The Door Open for you!
Quando vierem pro Brasil,  só vou por causa das mulheres lindas . Só da gatas
Sheessh, bruno's voice so good i wanna make babies with him
Feels like I can't get enough of Silk Sonic.
Bruno Mars is a living LEGEND.
Bruno and Anderson usually share the limelight equally. But Bruno's confidence and showmanship here is jaw dropping. If there is another artist who can flirt - up close and physical - at the same time as singing at his level, I have yet to see them.
Eles estão PERFEITOS eu AMO essa MÚSICA. GRATIDAO
Eles estão PERFEITOS eu AMO essa MÚSICA. GRATIDAO
3:08 Anderson look so pissed at Bruno for one upping him LMAO
Nadie habla sobre la química que mostraron Bruno Mars y la chica fue demasiado tierno 💗🧡
Amo todas as músicas do bruno march
She deffs got wet for suuuuure
bruh they're hillarious
Simplesmente espetacular.
Que fantásticos juegos de voces, armonías, una belleza de música.
I love
Mi mami me dio la vida pero Bruno Mars las ganas de vivirla
amo essa versão mas esse áudio baixo é uma desgraça
ANG GALING MO BLACK JAACK
Yes the vocals are on point, but less we forget .Paaks acting, 2:22 this man looks so fucking done with Bruno right here
Antes o mundo tinha Michael Jackson hoje temos Bruno Mars
Dem boyz cold AF!
What happened with andy?
here, no dislikes
let anderson get a girl lmao
So great.
Thats art. Thats it.
Love the adlibs.
Bruno Mars… you really are out of this world 😎👌
Is it me or did I just see Bruno cock block Anderson @ 2:20?
#MASSIVE❤❤❤❤
When the hole band is your wingman
Who knows the ig of the sitting girl
Es una riata Bruno Mars !!  Bendiciones 🙏🙏
Wow that 60fps !
The music video is so dreamy and the live performance similarly dreamy. Smooth like a butter
Anderson paak you can do no wrong in my eyes with your music
All flat
We don’t deserve this  combo. They are insanely talented
Talented to the bone
am I the only who thinks anderson .paAk is an absolute freak..
Merci avec le Covid qu’elle bouffée d’oxygène
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤️💋
A voz de vcs são muito lindas 👏👏👏👏👏
Bruno e Anderson ❤️
Pure unbridled talent on loan from god!
Не перестану обожать эту песню 💓
The one and only. The only ONE!
Bruno Mars is the best male vocalist of our generation
One of rhe best live performance of all time !! ❤️
It was Bruno's subtle tap on Andy's back to join him at the front rail!!!
There has been a red hue over the sky since this performance. What a blush she got
Such a brilliant collaboration between Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars. Love when Anderson Paak took a couple seconds for himself at 1:26 to emphasize his greatness with Bruno hyping him. So sweet... Bruno Mars changed the lyrics at 3:30 and said, "I'mma leave my biggest mansion door open." lol. He did that. Love it!
i am a full grown man crying  hehehehe
I would pay to them live!
I want to be that girl Bruno is singing to...! 🥰 Lucky girl 😭
Just wow…
I wanna be there ! 🥲🥲
극락,,,,
GRANDISSIMO BRUNO DALL ITALIA 👍👍👍👍
Anyone who can profile the blushing girl 👧
OMG - thr finish is just tooo sweet! Call the doctor, I need some insulin, y'all...
bro at 2:23 anderson looked so upset that bruno started singing to the same girl😂
🔥✨🌟✨.. 🎶🎵
OMG, I so love them.  I am seeing them in Vegas in May.  I saw Bruno last July and I swear it was amazing.
황홀하다…
Bruno at 3:42 is just ridiculous!!
Bruno Mars: “I will leave my biggest mansion open for you girl” 😂🤣😂🤣
Al escuchar a Bruno Mars, inevitablemente recuerdo al grupo Earth, Wind and Fire. Se había perdido ésta calidad en arreglos vocales  armonía, y una hermosa melodía. Me alegra mucho que las nuevas generaciones escuchen Música de tan alta Calidad, como la de los años setentas y ochentas. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Love it soooooo much ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Божественно!!! Легенды
Keep those vocal oiled up.
So this https://youtu.be/MHKjFH6dk6Y is what happened.....
Bruno be playing with the notes like it's child's play 😅
That woman creamed her pants 💦
Woooh kunana ket agkyak metten.
Nabasa boses na jay maysa nya.
Bruno Mars vestido de Reginaldo Rossi top demais kkk
First tagalog comment galeng pwede na hahaha just kidding
Love Anderson!!!!
Aqui no Brasil já sucesso nacional parabéns Deus que abençoe vocês sorte sempre
The best after Earth 💨 & 🔥
EPIC SOUL..YOU KNOW AMERICA NEEDS THIS....HALLELUJAH AND AMEN
God bless the audience for trying to sing along on this tough song.
Best International Group at the Brit Awards this year!
It was just AMAZING, and i just wanna know which accent it was at 0:13-0:16?
Che performance!
https://youtu.be/emidWf3UdxQ
2:38 I want too 🤭🤭🤭🤭❤️
こっちの世界すげーな
내몸이 다 녹아내렸어요ㅜㅜ왜이렇게 설레게 하나요♥울집도 문열어 놓을게요~
Bruno gets the ladies he wants. Damn!
Superb combo ❤️💃🏽🥳👊🏽
🔥🔥🔥
I sure hope those chairs were waterproof...
Um show  lindo parabéns top.
So the girl at 2:38 literally just became the luckiest person in the world. Omg I would DIE if that were me 😩😩😩
INCRIVEL 💖

Sexy song ❤️
I guess too much confidence is never a bad thing
I’m literally speechless every single time. I’m obsessed
You know the notes are high when your mainly-female audience can't reach it
the money i'd pay to see them live
Que  maravilha
really good BRUNO and  the men black  amazing  bravo
These 2 together know how to bring it
Soooooo talented
They were literally fighting over the girl to sing too 3:06
They were literally fighting over the girl to sing too 3:06
mi mollllllllllllllllll
Это просто класс. Бруно- перыекто
Cuanto amor por Brunito 💜
Nobody is talking about how Bruno is stealing Andersons Girls! 😂😂😂
2:39 BRUNOOOONOooooNooo you seductive Man! you CAN'T do that to MEE😭😭😭😭😭😭 You're a married man don't give me *hope!* I've never lived sooo vicariously though another person in my life!
hee hee
Ai meu coração.
Lmao paak so damn silly I love him I love them all
The  lady who Bruno pushed her hand to his chest just blushed 😊  If was me  I would  have had a heart attack...😅🥰🥰🥰🥰🥲😁
Eversince Bruno's live performance at the Apollo Theatre i was smitten. He is on another level! Versace on the Floor just does it for me🔥🔥🔥
Vivendo apenas pra ir em um show desse homem pelo amor de deus🤕
i wish i was that girl.
Bruno Mars still needs an album with Cardi B
Them harmonies...damn Silk!!! 💘
2:38 i wish i was her hahah
Good performance the crowd was feeling it too !
A mina aguentou bem, se Bruno faz isso comigo eu ia morrer alí mesmo.
❤️
Like what a player Bruno is like heck yeah
Really no one noticed?? 2:20 look at the face of Anderson when Bruno starts to sing and push him... And at 3:05... Same thing
I only just found out the lyrics the other day when he says « if you’re hungry girl i’ve got filets », i initially thought he sang : « if you’re hungry girl i got the lays » as in potato chips/ crisps when you get the munchies after smoking purple haze… 🤷🏻‍♂️
Best song I've heard in Decades  I'm 55 and I've had some awesome musical decades
the open part really hits different. I felt butterflies T-T. I'm a millennial and I just appreciate Bruno Mars right now, damn he makes me blush
Anderson Paak is amazing
I would give anything to be that girl.
She got to know
Amo ouvir durante o dia as musicas de Bruno Mars e Anderson  são os meus amores!
This was both hilarious and wonderful!!!
Um artista completo 😍| Bruno Mars Nosso Querido
Yazawa
damn bruno and anderson slays!!
Sensacional 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❤️❤️❤️❤️
umarınm yasadığım duygu yoğunluğunu başka zaman da tadarım.çok sık karsılaşmıyorum bu hislerle
For some reason I always imagined Bruno Mars being a white dude, some kind of John Mayer reinstantiation 🤣
yeah good luck to any artist coming up after this
more than amazing.. artistry and showmanship..
Bruno mars is always the best 👌

Bruno Mars se mantém intacto perante ao sucesso, desde sempre, ótimo artista, música incrível, memorável, megahit! Bruno Mars é a mais potente e comparável voz mais próxima ao estilo do também poderoso Michael Jackson. 👏👏👏❣️
Bruno Mars is an absolute legend his vocals 🔥🔥
This is the best version of the song so far. Even more than the official music video. With the 70's setting, the costumes, Bruno's curls, and the plot of the play they both performed  along with the audience's singing 👏 👏 👏🤩
I enjoy listening and watching them both perform!!!
Maravilhoso
Amo todas as músicas do bruno  march
Perfect 😉
magnifique !
Describe un one word
Perfection
face 3:06
Que hermosa canción y que bonito lo interpretan anbos pues viendo a esta estrella de Bruno cada día más m encanta mi cabello   bendicio es
I love this song
The best
They are having so much fun up there! Total and equal flow of energy from the entertainers to the audience. It's beautiful!
We love bruno from Philippines 🇵🇭
I Love...amazing, incrible, nostalgic 👏👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🥰
Nicky the best!!!!!!
I would love to have these two as my BFF.
Moça de sorte 😀😍 Bruno Mars ⚡⚡♥️🎤 👉 Silk sonic 💘
So good😍
My favorite part is the 70s-style on stage fighting for girls.
Hermoso, hermoso, me encantan ❤❤❤❤❤❤🇦🇹🇦🇹🇦🇹🇦🇹🇦🇹🇦🇹
DO YOU HEAR THAT LAST RIFF FROM BRUNO, I THINK I JUST ASCENDED INTO THE HEAVENS. THE SOUND THAT CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH WAS ANGELS AT WORK.
bruno mars is the sexiest man alive
This song and “Wait a Second!” by Lukaz are some of the only things getting me through the beginning of 2022 💚 Times may be tough but everything going to be okay in the end. I hope everyone is doing well. I love you 💝
Mmh ichileya mu audience, mayo eh😂😂😂
I like how the audience sounds like a middle school chorus class. 😂
Bruno Mars não tem uma música que eu não goste. Eu amo esse homem, meu sonho de consumo é te conhecer...❤👏
How does Bruno not sound at all different from studio version, his vocals are sooo clean!
Dumb music for a dumbed down culture, and people ready for complete destruction. These are grown men with the intellectual lyrical content of seven year olds, they should be embarrassed to make this type of empty music in the serious times we live in, and their audience should hold these "musicians" to a higher standard, but looking at the comment section, most of their audience seems to have already been lobotomized to where it does not even matter. Like attracts like.
That Bruno. What a dream boat. 😍
[ 2:20 ] I swear, 30-seconds of Bruno's croonin', and she's ready to bear his children!  😎
Bruno Mars is the best singer of the this generation
Bruno Mars we love you❤
sheeeeeeeesh 🔥
Bruno can sing sing ❤️❤️🤤
This is what radio has been missing!!
Comedy cry
3:59 JYP could never
Tell me why I’m jealous of that chick
The stage chemistry they have is amazing
Ooh, you're so sweet (so sweet), so tight (so tight) I won't bite (ah-ah), unless you like (unless you like) If you smoke (what you smoke?)

Awesome, as always. 🗣🎶✨
02:40 THAT SHOULD BE ME
Ok
3:04 anderson starts to look a bit annoyed that bruno was rubbing up on him and taking the girl he was focusing on lmfao
Pure talent
As a group singer all of my life, I have to say these guys are THE BEST singers and entertainers that have ever hit the stage in this genre.Skill, finesse and class. "NUF SAID."
Keren
너무좋다~~
Love u always bruno mars 💖😍😍
I swear to god everything time I hear this I just fall in love with Bruno’s voice. Second best after MJ!!
Dave Chapelle + LL Cool J + Cuba Gooding Jr = Anderson Paak
well I guess she ain’t washing that hand for the rest of her life 😂
Se é loko , os caras quebro nesse som 🔛🔥 top demais!
Vous chanter trop bien et anderson je voudrais le rencontrer vraiment je suis une chanteuse venez me voir sur lovoo ou  YouTube  mon compte

Love these guys they is awesome together great music Anderson paak is a bad dude.
Okay, there's a ton of humor and satire involved, granted. But burried beneath that, IS THE REALEST FUCKING MUSIC ON THE PLANET TODAY. Screw that auto tuned bullshit, Those two just belted out some CLASSIC R &F U C K I N B! We need WAY more of this and WAY less of that mumble rap horseshit. And don't @ ME because they prove me right with every live performance that isn't lip synced and every spotify play. So yeah, take that over produced crap they keep peddlin' and cram it. I'll take THIS RIGHT HERE.
Inacreditável. Ao vivo ainda consegue ser melhor do que gravado no estúdio.. 👏👏👏👏
Any support for music here 👋👋🔥
Bruno singing his ass off! No fake singing from him. Those veins don't lie!
bruno is hot and knows it. He knows how women like it. And he is VERY aware of it.
They did that!😍

This made me so happy 😊
Qualidade do vídeo sensacional!!
Guarantee that seat is wet after Bruno put her hand on his chest!
I love you Bruno Mars 😍💘
Wow amazing…
That  Anderson guy sounds like Dave Chapelle lol
The closest thing to Michael Jackson!
Breathless performance
Silk Sonic is the best band in the 21centry
We don’t deserve them!🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
if bruno puts my hand on his bare chest while singing to me, i will simply pass away.
Yes
2:31 あの女性、すごい経験をしたなぁ
I feel like, to attend one of Silk Sonic's live performances I need a proper dress, classic old money shoes, and a nice hairdo I swear to god. What is this fancy dinner date atmosphere.
Why do I feel like they just stole my woman? Been single 2 years..
Was it just me but at 3.07 Anderson seems agitated with Bruno for pushing against him hard 😂😂😂😂😂 did anyone else catch that?
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷😍😍😍😍
💚🙏😇🙏💚
everytime Bruno Mars sings,it feels like ur listening to a pre recorded song..damn Great singer!!👏👏👏
Whenever bruno sings, i curse because THAT IS HOW GOOD HE IS
I love it when Bruno jokes around, like he pushed anderson, away, n when he looked shocked when Anderson hit note!! Lol I think he is a practical joker!! Love ya Bruno m Anderson, all Silk Sonic!!
At 2:24 & 3:06 Fr look like he’s irritated at Bruno. Watch carefully lolololol
Super
they kiiled that i like the part when mr anderson was like i got fliay and when he did that move
Q vozes são essas, sem or
Once you go down a soul sonic rabbit hole, pack a bag. no misses with them
Those two backing harmonies are 👌❤️❤️
I can play this song all day long👏❤️
I just saw Bruno in Vegas an New Year, the first song started and I have tears in my eye, I was emberace  for a 63 year old guy to do that but it was too strong of a moment
this crow is so off key jesus
Absolutely unreal
코로나만 지나면 한국오겠죠?
❤💋
2021年の時代に、ドソウル！ ありがとう
2:30
É incrível a capacidade de Bruno Mars de fazer cada canção única....
GOAT! one of the best n crisp vocalists of all time <3
is it a part of their act or did anderson get a little pissed off when bruno came to sing to the girl? and once again at 3:05..
Bruno Mars is pure real artist
Absolutely brilliant , what a combination .
Quel talent ! Je vous adore monsieur bruno mars ! Bonne et heureuse année à vous ! Et a vos proches ! Je commence l'année 2022! En vous regarder ! Merci ! Bises katy trules ! French ! Bne fête a tout ceux qui liront ce message ! Je vous embrasse ! Prenez soin de vous ! ❤❤❤❤❤😘🏖🏝♥️
Lalala lalalaaaaa was heavenly for me
Wow....fire. Love the outfits. Wouldn't it be great if Ron Burgundy and his news crew came out and they all sang Afternoon Delight?
♡
I fell in love with Bruno at 2:21 - 2:47 bro😭✋🏼💗
Now why couldn’t that lady be me?
how anyone can hate these two is unfathomable. bruno is on the best run of his career right now and that's astounding when you consider how much bruno has already accomplished. so happy for andy to finally be getting his shine!
I come back here every day
Dude gave me freaking chills. God what’s my talent 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤣🤣
2:38 bruno mars faz isso cmg, eu desmaio
When Bruno put the woman hand on his chest..dam
If Bruno Mars put my hand on his chest, I would simply die
Just perfect  ..
no words except GORGEOUSNESS
O disco todo está F... Os caras estão se divertindo fazendo isso.. soa natural! Tudo em sintonia!!
3:04 Doesn't look like Anderson liked that nudge from Bruno lol
When you grow up wanting to be a singer, this is what you mean. This is sangin'.
Imoral!!! Canta demais!!!!
i think this is the best thing to happen to music in 2021, silk sonic is just perfect in my opinion
Omg they are a force to be reckon with… this was so good 😊
Nice man and nice song
bruno is like a super cool guy that everyone thinks is cool, and paak is his best friend who is super funny.
No way , Bruno mars just killed autotune
Jackson's Style 1:23 <3
wooh
Simplemente maravilloso 💖😍
So we’re not gonna talk about how Bruno let that girl touch him 😫😫😫
These guys remind me of two siblings that were separated at birth and finally meet again after 38 years and are completely in awe of each other
3:41 is fuckin crazy
This building was full of sex tonight
Had the pleasure of watching him in concert in vegas last dec 18( and yes he took our phones away 😂😂) he’s even more amazing live
Just wondering how romantic  bruno is 🙃
Ahhh Se vc põe minha mão no seu peito, acho que infarto😅😅😅❤❤❤❤❤
The radio have been missing music like this for years
Amazing! How can i miss that so long!!!!!!!!
Senzational
Bruno mars so talented
3:30 this!
I’ve never listened to an album everyday since it’s come out. It’s one of the best ever.
In my opinion, Bruno is the best male vocalist of our time on the other hand Paak has opened a new paradigm in music history, a comment from a country of Squid Game
Músic my beautiffull
Great singers on stage, horrible singers in the crowd. Holy shit, they are all tone deaf xD
And my journey of watching all Bruno Mars live performances continues
Bruno is such an amazing artist,and songwriter...he writes folks...all his hits and even others hits like um " F*ck You" by cee lo.....and im pretty sure he can out women in a state of hypnosis with his singing and moves......damn ,to be him!!
Better than a musical marvel hero could ever be created. I love this fellow Hawaiian so much!
3:06 Anderson. Paak face says everything
1:52
Merry christmass bruno mars
Sexy as Bruno Mars!!’ 🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️Chills😘😘
great crowd!
all the audience screaming and shouting inside the masks.... imagine all the saliva splashing onto the inner mask... and they can smell their own saliva.... ;p lmao....
MONSTERS!!!
Been obsessed with them since its' release now that they've unveiled their debut album, Looking forward to them sweeping all the awards next year.
https://youtu.be/Tr479M9JQ1U?t=141 is it supposed to be like this? Like Bruno pushed Anderson away?
the unstoppable bruno mars, so far the correct way to introduce him
3:30 Ima leave my big-ass mansion door open lmao
Omg Bruno Put Her Hand On His Chest!! God Thats Presentation is On Fire!
Bruno has a puuuure voice periodt.
ребята, Вы лучшие😍💕
Without words
Es increíble la forma en que cantan. IMPRECIONANTE
if that was my girl right there and he did that i would let it happen cause i cant go after that and its Bruno mars.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Such a fresh breath of air.
Fucking A!!! These are the best singers, like if they don’t win a Grammy for this song !!!! Love you guys so much all the way from North Miami🥰😘
my dream 😫🙏 I love Bruno 🥰
Yes!
Bruno Mars is soooo smooooth
Who she is? 2:31
Já vi esse vídeo milhões de vezes. Amo essa apresentação demaaaais, e amo o jeito que o Andy toca bateria mesmo sem estar na bateria hahahha
LOVE this song so much.  💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
CHRISTMAS LOVE SONG = 2021 * Christmas is coming and I'm all alone With no one to snuggle at night. My wineglass is empty to help dull desire To kiss you by soft candlelight.  A rare pearl of value, you don't leave alone Or someone will steal them from you. After they've gone and flown far away It's hard to know just what to do.  I'm watching my neighbors hang lights on their tree With tinsel and striped candy cane. I took you for granted and didn't hug enough And now I must suffer my pain.  Lord, I'm so lonely; I wish I could die Then be born to relive again. I realize the value of someone to love And the danger of my selfish sin.  There's a ring on my phone and a knock at the door Which do I dare go for? If neither is you, I'll break down and cry And again pound my fist on the floor.  I run down the hall and the doorknob turns As the swirling snow rides on the wind. There, in my doorway, it's the face I love Such a beautiful present to send.  Now, I am happy and dancing around With a permanent smile on my face. As children are singing their Christmas love songs And the world is a wonderful place.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

This is true original content. Not this electronically composed musics recently released.
Superb Bruno reminds me Michael
Is it normal that I smile in every single song of him?
3:05  parang mananapak eh ayaw masapawan ahahah ✌✌
I was in tears this was so great lol
1:22 extraordinario 😄😂
Anderson kinda looks like Dave Chappelle
Man this is just the best music and I'm SO glad it's doing so incredibly well in 2021. So amazingly well written , soulful and brilliant  :-)
The drum bass of this song damn good
This song is obbession

Love the crowd play with this version, such a duo
2:38 cryyy :(
Thank you good for this
These guys are on a new whole level man 😌
yo amo a bruno
Can we all agree when it's hard to find real artists the public needs no participation?
Alright someone call the custodian . Tell ‘em bring a wet floor sign for row 1 seat 1

브루노 마스 애드리브는 진심 지림x10이네 ;;

라이브라는게 믿기지가않네
Música maravilhosa! Que delícia de ouvir! Bruno Mars arrasa e agora com essa parceria tá arrebentando!😍😍
I'm mad these brothas taking the vibe back to all those singing group movies that were done in the 90s (see Temptations & 5 Heartbeats). ❤️❤️❤️❤️
That off key audience makes you realise how difficult this song is to sing! 😂🤩
Simplesmente maravilhoso 🇧🇷
Phone rings 📱   Friend: What you doing?  Me: Where you at?  Friend: Oh You got plans?  Me: Don't say that.  Friend: I'm sipping wine in a robe. I look too good to be alone.   Me: My house clean. I just shaved.  We should be dancing, romancing in the east wing and the west wing of this mansion. What's  happening   Friend: I ain't playing no games. Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart. So if you try to lay in these arms... Imma leave the door open 🎶   Me: Get that 24k magic ready 😋
Bruno ain't lost a beat! Those vocals 🔥
Their outfits and choreography are E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.A.N.G.  🔥
I won't bite unless you like....  Every woman: Please bite me 🤣❤🤣

Hino demais😍
The last run at 3:59 was so smooth.
The best collab, best duo, best back up singers, best musicians. bruno, anderson and the whole team 😭💖👏
Bruno pitch perfect Mars
O filho do Michael Jackson é brabo!!!
So smooth voice kababayan.. Keep it up and always take care.. Godbless..
TODO UN SHOW IMPRESIONANTE COMO LO HACIA MICHAEL JACKSON!!!!
WOW! Bruno and the boys really did it this time!
I love it! Best song of the year !
My new favorite song no lie
Anderson is so extra!!!!
Did I see a little tuffle at 3:08?
<3 Germany :D
y isnt anybody talking abt how beautifully the audience sang??
Bruno and anderson are something else
best duo
Their voices make me overwhelming. I'm really fall in love with this collab🥺❤️
Every versions just get better and better!!!
1. who is the girl they "fought" over? 2. how were the women in the seats on the stage chosen? 3. why didn't she stand up??!!
the woman in the chair at 2:18 is sooo luckyyyyy
Outstanding!!
I would die if I was that girl THAT CLOSE TO BRUNO
3:30 leave my big ass mansion door open  😂😂😂😂😂  slick line bruno
I flinched so hard at 1:16 and yelled out "Flat!" ... As if I can hit that high note myself 🤣😂
Anderson said get off my spotlight bruno
Vocals talent wow
3:03 desde que vi eso de bromear asi, me di cuenta que estos 2 son buenos amigos.
"I will leave my big ass mansion door open, girl" -Peter Gene Hernandez, 2021
lol Yeah they definitely watched the 5 Heartbeat movie before performing this version
Filipino blood right there. Music running through veins
Bruno grew up performing songs from his idols... How many kids see him and now want to do the same. Gottttdamn these boys know how to make hits lol
GOAT
If you listen really closely to the first time bruno says " so if you tryna play in these arms" when he says tryna it sounds so smooth
Play on Pleyah's !!! 💯💯🙌🏽🙌🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Must-have been feeling that girl, because he went off key lol, woman are powerful! No matter who you are fellas!!!
this made my day
BMs singing is absurd. Like really, really absurd. How is that even possible? I´m stunned.
2:38
killin it
Anderson paak. is good on his own but with bruno, holy hell.
These guys are on fire... but dang... Bruno Mars' vocals.... azufre. <3
Thé harmony ´s inside him!
This give me Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin performing “You’re my everything” in The Temptations movie! Fire 🔥 nonetheless!
Muito dez! Maravilhoso! Sucesso !
i would pass away if bruno mars serenaded me
Bruno know his little ass is smooth… 🥵
Uau!
I love the underlying humour! It’s great music, it’s fun music. What more can you ask for
man I'm straight and i wish i was that girl
Hell yeah!!! Now ya Talkin baby!!!! I thought that  this project was going to be some B$#@ S#(&#,,,,! Boy was I wrong as homemade sin!!!! Awesome!!!!
3:07 paak bit annoyed there
From the side i thought that was kelly kapowski from saved by the bell and bruno was a.c. slater but smoother.
She refused to stand up but bruno truned it into something spectacular
Min 3:41/3:52....... bruno mars is the man 🎶🔥💣
If you knew Anderson music you would laugh and say bruno copied him for this album. Listen to Yes Lawd album
Golden!
The arrangement for and (execution of) the all of the harmonies around ~3:22-3:24~ is incredible.
👍👍👍👍😎😎😎😎😎😎😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I’m breathless 🌹
The way Silk Sonic opens award shows so that they make a statement and then dip out is a MOOD.
Had all them women vibing lol
I was about to pass out
the showmanship
se o Bruno não pegou aquela mina eu sou uma torradeira da brastemp
Song Of The Year
There is hope for real music. Incredible performances
Bruno never disappoints
3:21
I thought it was funny how they kept nudging eachother and you can see Anderson getting more and more annoyed
I once did a presentation on bruno mars when i was like 11, and in doing research found out how we had a similar thing growing up. Tho i ain't gonna be a singer, i can be an amazing bartender tho.
at 3:05 Paak looked actually annoyed that Bruno "stole" the girl from him again, then he restarted his game and moved to the last girl in line lol
damn i think 2020s music already peaked
Nah wtf?!?! These Niqqas ELITE
anderson is a comedian
Niceeeee <3
The background singers just vibing in the back is giving me life
I LOOOOOVE Bruno Mars!!! He totally has that "je ne sais quoi!"
the dramatics.. HAHAHA.. love it.
"I'm leaving my big ass mansion door open" LMFAO that got me good
This collab is golden. Everyone's gonna sing praises for Bruno, but Anderson's showmanship and comedy is amazing and complements this collab. Hope they keep this up even beyond one album.
I still cant believe autotuned bts band boys won the awards over these real song artist
3:58 omg Bruno
1:10 is the best Bruno has ever sounded. and that's reeeeally saying a lot.
esos dos se estaban peleando jajaja
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 amazing...nice  brow.
Anyone knows the name of the backing vocals? That one beside Anderson is so handsome
imo this is beter than the studio version
Gente eh impressão minha + esse Anderson Paak quer roubar ah cena 🤔🙄 já eh segunda vez q'veio ele improvisando,hum hum ah Estrela eh (Bruno Mars) ah voz incondicional e ah dele 🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Singers who actually sing.
I’m so obsessed with with them and I wish I could have been there, why do I have to be so young 😩❤️‍🔥
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍
And just like that, all lip-synching acts were single handedly destroyed.
EM GÁI SƯỚNG CỨNG HẾT CẢ NGƯỜI :)) MẤT NGỦ MẤY THÁNG . ÔNG ANH BRUNO THÂM THẾ K BIẾT :))))
out of the world
This is great no cap oh my goodness
que le  enseñen esto a los reguetoneros para que aprendan a cantar..... bestial
These two are having SO MUCH FUN! I LOVE IT!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
they're lowkey dressed like the first black union soldiers in the civil war
for a second I thought Kevin Hart was a backup singer lmao
banas thank you for this dedication continuously love you all banas
70s and 80s, we were happy and we didn’t know.
Pure talent, soul, class...
I have Loved my Bruno for years. Anderson u r soooooo cool also.🌹
2:20 Bro that girl is so fucking lucky holy shit im a man but im jealous
AMAZING!!!
That was awesome!
If these two ever quit singing they could be a really good comedy team - Bruno shoving Anderson out of the way was too funny. 😻
Anderson crazy 😂😂😂
Who are the 2 background singers bc im trying to see something with red in the middle lol
Bruno, period.
Bruno mars is underrated the next generation though they will obsess over him
Muito  boa essa canção  parece que nós leva ao céu
Bruno Mars is seriously underrated
Bruno is like Christmas.. its chillin
I WOULD HAVE FAINTED ON THE SPOT IF IT WERE ME
This girl sitting down is the same  hight as bruno thats mad, Go off short King <3
I don't remember last time I got goose bumps from listening to music.  THIS SONG DID IT!
It can't stop being my ringtone
I'm leaving my door open for you Bruno. 🥰🥰🥰
This duo is amazing
I would sell my kidney, lung, sister, mom, dog to exchange places with the girl at 2:22 😩😍😍 Handsome Bruno touching & singing to me???😭😭
IMMA LEAVE MY BIGASS MANSION DOOR OPEN 😭🤟 this is just too iconic imma make sure to tell this monumental event to my grandchildren
They are so theatric 😂😂😭😭
MUITO FOFOS!!!
The audience singing tho 😖😂 I winced at the “tell me that you’re comin through “
el min 3:58 , así suenan los ángeles
YESSSSS
Surely she will leave this planet to the Mars because she wanna dance with Bruno there, maybe forever after.  If she won’t, I will 😤🤤
عالی هستین داداشا
Respect to the leads but that piano will be lonely, I'm Eddie canein ro
Oh bruno, I meltz
GODS
ESPECTACULAR
Thank you Lord we have Bruno Mars in this generation...
just love this song , beautiful men xxx
Anak ng tokwa!!! Kinikilig na ko sayo Bruno ay!!!😍😄
God loves you and he wants to save everyone, but in order for him to do that, you need to repent and be baptized. Also share his gospel with everyone you come in to contact with and keep his commandments 🙏🏾😘
He is SO smoothe
Uau ao vivo 😍 Quem sabe faz, que vozes 😍❤️
I would have died on the spot
is it me or is this live version more interesting than the studio version.
that’s the most tone deaf audience i’ve ever heard, i thought they’re would be enough people to harmonize but i was WRONG
They are all enjoying, love this. Love u guys, things will be okay❤
아~ 떼창맛 부족하네
They really sound so fckin same as the studio version😭😭😭😭 The audience tho 😭😭😭
3:58 is the smoothest run I have ever heard
Done brought back that smooth 'ol school R & B sound. Love their style.
사랑해요 브루노!!! ( I LOVE BRUNO ❤ )
You know what fuck you Anderson.Paak for being so damn awesome!!!
I thought I didn’t like happy music I DO NOW smiling through the whole thing
It’s a  ”Philly - Joy”.....
Amazing performance
This is literally a tribute to the 5 Heartbeats movie in SPADES. Love it.
why these chicks just sitting awkwardly in chairs at the front too lol
got the whole asian fan girl line up in the front row lol
Finally some Real music 🎶 with meaning 💯♥️
Wow 😳
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH BRUNO!
Why is there 5 girls sitting in those bar chairs?
the way i would simply... pass away if Bruno Mars grabbed my hand, let alone put it on his CHEST while he sings to me!?!?
The bestttt!!!!
Wow!
bruno mars voice😨😨😨😨😨
Not to be too graphic but I can confirm that there were zero, I repeat zero panties that left that venue dry. 🤷🏾‍♂️💁🏾‍♂️👏🏾
I’m dead when the audience sings 💀 Looks like it’s too hard to hit those notes (which it is don’t get me wrong)
The biggest thing I can get from this performance, is that Bruno is having fun.  You can tell from the way he is interacting with the girls and the crowd, this is the most fun he has had on stage in a while.  He just looks like he is having the time of his life, and it just adds to an already incredible performance to make it absolutely perfect
omg this is fantastic
It's so good when you are with your friend and you can do music that you love while keep your core brand in-tact, which is the case for both Anderson and Bruno - they lose nothing here and perform great music. There is no pressure other than to have fun and enjoy each other. As Bruno said, "hopefully we, the fans, come along for the ride."
Perfeito🔥
Top class love them ❤️
Rare high tenor, like Stevie, incredible voice.
This song is so Smooth, every time I hear it..it makes me want to say  oh yeahhhhhhhhhh in low tone voice.
The pause that Anderson made GAH DAYM
3:02 huy o_o Anderson mad at bruno mars for a shove hahaha
Bruno mars is on 🔥 🔥 🔥
Anderson Peak! I am a new fan Bruno Mars I was, I am a fan and I will be a fan
Omg call 911 ☎️That girl was a class act! She’ll never forget that! And Anderson’s reaction was heart felt ❤️
O My God, Damn This so Good To Hear Once 😍😍
Anderson Paak 💯💯💯💯
any one nitice the 5 heartbeats moment?
Bruno's run at the end... just wow... gave me goosebumps
I aint even pressed bout saying this but, as a straght male,  if bruno mars hold my hand like that woman's im leaning in for a kiss.
BiEm the only ONE
I genuinely smiled, and giggled watching this performance. I’ve grown up watching videos of music in my parents and grandparents eras wishing for this. It’s so awesome to experience it. The men look so classy! And the women artist get even more trashy! DONT know how that makes sense   Thank you for this! We want more ! Please and thank you
This performance got me blushing and questioning my sexuality.
Maravilhosos😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💖💖💖💖💖💖👋
"imma leave my big ass mansion door open" LOOOL everything about this performance is goated, can't wait for smokin out the window lets gooo
Just wow
Love this song
Woooooh! Bruno mars!!!!!! Your're the best!!
완벽하다..목소리 카메라 연출…….
Bruno Mars once again making me feel shy through a phone screen 🤪🙈
Why am I just now seeing this 5 months latwe
I find it funny that most people cant carry a tune
The last hope of R&B
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE ENDING WHERE BRUNO KILLS THAT SHIT
Que lindo! Sensacional. Incrível. Michael Jackson iria gostar disso.
"Imma leave my big ass mansion door open girl"
OH MY 🤰🏻🤰🏻🤰🏻🤰🏻
Bruno's voice is like velvet.   The only other male singer that I love more is maybe Freddie Mercury.
Rip Micheal Jackson the world misses you you left so many of your Employees empty handed god rest your soul king of pop
Rip Pop I'll miss you forever
2:20 BRABO
wtf is bruno mars range
Demais topp
Cara eu já ouvi várias vezes e continuo ouvindo várias vezes #Brazilonline
Ya'll are Awesome Amazing Gentleman's truly are blessed 🎈🎈🎈🎈 💞 your performances
Now this is pure talent and real music!! And the ladies comes home to their boyfriends saying; Baby, I am yours but tonight your name is "Bruno Anderson"!
These two men make my ear melt.
Not a dry seat in the house 🌊
Just when you think the studio version is the best.  Bruno Mars: Hold my 🍺
I like the James Brown stunt Anderson did
Bruno, you are unstoppable!
that look ander gave to bruno at 2:19
I love this dude
That was too dope!
W🤯W! So good. Too good.
Thank god at last at the age of 68 some real entertainment absolutely fabulous beautiful song but great singers loved it. Real music not this crude sex satanic crap 💩 that are has nothing to do with the love of music but more to do with corrupting the young and brainwashing. This is up with the 60, 70, 80, and some 90. Music thank you Bruno and crew. 😍😘🤣
I will leave my door.. my window. . every thing will be OPEN!
Bruno Mars so SEXY!
I feel like when Bruno pushes AP both times it wasn’t apart of the act I just think that Bruno wants all the spotlight I mean I love Bruno he’s an inspiration but he needs to share the spotlight
That last part is amazing
Seeing “Put On A Smile” live is going to be nuts
Daaaaaamn Anderson 💗💗💗💗💗
Were the people at the front audience??? If that was me I would've just died there and then 😱
This music is giving me happiness
tell me that chu comin’ tHROUiGhHjhHhHHHHHHhhhHhh
Шикарно !!!!
❤️
Music is...back.
bruno started his official music video 2010  ,he  want to be a billionaire  so he can buy the tings he never had , he want to be in the cover of magazines . now he is billionaire and in the cover of magazines  2021 what an achievement
you can just tell how much they're having fun
I don't think 1:22  was scripted, Bruno and Kam both looked surprised.
It seems every song he writes is a super hit.
In-A-Robe
すごい！！！！
Hi
青春時代に戻った気持ちです。
心にしみわたります。
this is the real music
AMAZING! KEEP IT UP KAPATID!
One of the best performances ive seen, hilarious, exciting and truly ingenious
B1A4’s Banas where you at dedicate on the radio
Poor Anderson 😔 3:05
Hahah that play between them was great.
stop fighting over girls
This is pretty amazing
정상수 자연포경.
아멘..,
Chillin
that lucky bitch😭😪🤤
Im so jealous of that lady
Much thank you to bruno for letting me discover Anderson Paak, loved that guy at first vibe
3:07
Quisiera ser esa chica ❤️😍
Bruno I love you 🖤🖤🖤
b1a4 teddy bear you are just ooooh yeah
.paak went from homeless to getting signed by Dre and creating a legendary duo with Bruno mars 😢
Bruno mars
how 4000 people can dislike this is beyond me
I love them
Why does Bruno look like the seed of Sammy Davis Junior!
These young brothers brought life back to popular music! Salute! 🎼🎵🎶🎤🎤
Vocals outstanding live. They are both top musicians also , so will wait for the full live concert or versions of each song . This will elevate to them  another level imo . Any videos exist please share
Who ever gave this song and performance a thumbs down needs to have there head check ✔
Amazing
Man this dude just can’t make a bad song. Bruno is one of the beat performers of modern day. Dudes songs sound exactly the same, even better live. Not many people left that can do that nowadays. Natural vocalist.
Damn Bruno took it up a notch! ..
They are killing it!!!!!!!!!!
Bruno is arguably one the greatest Male vocalists to ever come along.  Ever.. PBP.
They just eat up with talent; from the flo' up!
I remember my ex left his door open , now I wish he would've kept it locked🤣😂😂😂
That girl is damnnn lucky...
느즈막히 한 2014년쯤부터 열심히 들었던거 같은데 브루노 마스.. 그때나 지금이나.. 니가 사람이냐.. 부럽다 여러가지 의미로..ㅠㅠ
Yesssss….. bring back that retro vibes….. this is just beautiful….the raw vocals, the high notes,  the humor ,everything!!!!!!
Omg
I think this live version is better than studio
Best song I heard in yearsss. So much soul 💗
Best new song in a long long time
Bruno Mars best vocal ever!!
If they do a Bobby Debarge story, Bruno should be the 1st Choice hands down
I was not a real fan of B.M earlier music, but the boy vocals on this . Wow !!!!
THIS is a perfect example of why LIVE performances continue to always be special  🔥🔥🔥  Each one is unique
Excellent 👌  Mais quand même! Hey c’est du Bobby Womack ça! ♥️
Lol Anderson is silly, foolishness hahahaha 😂
Bruno's ending was bad ass, "rdtdrmrdtdltls" WTF, all these in one breath, common Bruno
Ah... Bruno... ♥
Love the performance 🔥🔥🔥🔥…these guys really have the IT factor
BM hoonwood
bruno, minha porta está aberta para você meu amooooorrrrr
I just bought the new album as soon as it turned 12:01am.  This is their moment, we get to see it as it happens, they deserve all the press and views they’re getting now.
Bom demais, bom demais.
Very very few so called artists these days could even get remotely close to this performance, Amazing the lost are of harmonies.
Lol plus Andy is Married
I'M OBSESSED
You can't just be out here ruining these panties bro🤫😏
The smiles from Anderson, Kameron and Jamareo when Bruno sings the first line of the chorus
Anderson is ah whole mood 🥰🥰🥰
Hey, Bruno. That's not cool, bro. You stealing the girl from your buddy, that's not cool, man. 2:20 Not cool, not cool.
Leave the door open Smoking in the window Maybe next is jumping on the roof tops.  ;) Just kidding hehehe . Props to bruno and aderson .. ;)
🔥🔥🔥
such a melting, harmony... and goosebump all over my hand...
WHO ELSE LOVES THIS VIDEO
Minuto 2:40 Eu queria ser aquela mulher
I kept smiling through the whole performance. Absolutely amazing!
The way Bruno hypes up Anderson at 1:31 is so pure, he looked genuinely surprised as though Anderson wasn't supposed to do that. Anderson is a clown and always gives a good performance. I love them both and keep coming back to all of their live performances.
Awesome. Masks creepy tho..
Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak and Silk Sonic ft Giveon and Jacquees would be the best song made Perioddddd!!! Top 3 best male vocalists no cap
GOAT
lol these guys are comedy
I agree with Silk Sonic: we should do the 70s again!
Bravo!!!!!
a perfectly sublime performance by Andy and Bruno marred by these tonedeaf females in the audience lol 1:00
This song looks so fun to perform! Makes me want to take singing lessons!
Does anyone know if Anderson.Paak was upset at Bruno at 2:23 and 3:07? It looks like he got upset and moved away from him to go to another girl. Was that a part of the act?
bruno with a cheeky suiiiiiiii at the end
Got Game?
WOW…WOW…WOW🥰🥰😍😍🤟
Haha they are too much ❤️
se eu fosse aquela mulher eu desmaiava mds
I swear Micheal and prince must be smiling from heaven cause these guys are keeping the tradition alive in the old school music
They fuc***g KILLED IT
THIS SONG'S STILL MAKING U GROOVE...ONLY GOOD VIBES  BAD HABITS BY ED SHEERAN HERE:  https://youtu.be/nSJHGPTeV18 BAD HABITS BY ED SHEERAN HERE:  https://youtu.be/nSJHGPTeV18 BAD HABITS BY ED SHEERAN HERE:  https://youtu.be/nSJHGPTeV18
There was a time before they got together and Honestly I dont know how we made it this far. I can never look back
Love it!
Something just pissed Anderson off  3:05
Me encantan!!!!!!
Come on give Anderson his props. Yes Bruno can sing his ass off but Anderson brings more than vocals to the group.
🤣🤣 DAMNNNNN I’M OLD!!!! When I was a kid, everyone performed like this. I miss this vibe right here 🙏
im so in love TT
Perfeição,apenas.
All I know is that I gotta get tickets for whenever they go on tour
I'm incredibly satisfied with each member of this group. salute gentlemen!!!!
4000 people are freakin' idiots. This is damn amazing and you know it - haters.
It's actually insane how talented Bruno is!
bruno mars is a player, play boy 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Some of today’s artists have the talent an soul to make special music. This performance proves it.
I'm obsessed with the backing harmonies man, don't sleep on these 2 dudes, slaming it!
I love youuuuuuuuu
Smoooooooth!
Who is the lucky girl hold by Bruno Mars?
🥲i would faint in like… 2 seconds
Mr Mars you are a beautiful human being and you are like a magic man because you give at all the people happy moment with your songs and music ,God Bless You
This is off the charts old school good.

Bruno sos hermsoso!!!!!!  Saludos de Argentina!!🇦🇷❤️
BODY HEAT 1O5 %% We drank several glasses of champagne In the living room of her house. Around 9:30 that evening I found myself in her blouse.  I fondled and kissed her so gently Like the soft footsteps of a mouse. To my surprise, she opened her eyes And said, “look, we're not going to play house.”  I right away replaced her clothing And buttoned her blouse once more. There was no doubt of my defeat As I lay there upon the floor.  She said, “tell the truth, are you angry?” I answered, by far I was not "It's more important what you think of me Than what I may not have got."  She wiped away a tear from both eyes And said, "you're my kind of man." At that point, she did arise And to me she held out her hand  She led me away like a blind man Who had somehow lost his cane. When we reached her bedroom door I thought I'd gone insane.  Twenty fingers searched all the forbidden places As our body heats reached 105. If love's relief had not been achieved I doubt if we'd still be alive.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ! By Tom Zart Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share!

i can't help but get sammy davis jr vibes from bruno mars, love the guy
Why sunglasses to look cool? If they are in indoors, actually they are not seeing much. I don't think it's nice, it reminds me of the 3 blind mice.
Jackson5 of 21st Century
Que apresentação, meu amigo ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
What I see are crowds which are hungry for pure music...People are tired of industrial freaks created at last 30 years...Trash music and balloon singers are dying...Lady Gaga etc. out Parcels etc. in...👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
INCREIBLE
Stupidly amazing !!!!!
😍😍😍👌👌👌👏👏👏👏👏
Why is nobody talking about the dog sound Anderson made at 2:20 when  bruno pushed him
I’m a straight dude and if Bruno had me on stage touching his chest I would cream my pants on the spot 🤣🤣🤣
I tried his high notes it gave me sore throat for a week
라이브 정말 쵝오👍🤭
I am another 60 year young, yes young...who loves grooving to Bruno..when I see u lately u give me that Sammy Davis Jr vibe..in his day he was a performer.
I really like waiting for this moment 1:55 😌
Bruno mars you are the best singer and your band
thanks God we are in Russia, where we can live our daily life without face masks... in comparison with US' pseudo equality)) where there are the first class people and masked slaves
PLAYING ALL OF YOUR SONGS TODAY and WATCHING ALL OF YOUR LIVE PERFORMANCES BECAUSE IT'S YOUR 36TH BIRTHDAY!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE LEGEND HIMSELF, BRUNO MARS/PETER GENE HERNANDEZ/RICKY REGAL <3
Esta Canción Será desde hoy 2021 un Clásico !
Bruno Mars you are so handsome and gifted!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  May you be blessed with many more!  Love the song and everything about you!
Happy birthday to Bruno Mars！(^_-)-☆
lucky guy dont do us wtf
I like it , but listen close to the drums , that’s a backing track .;;the cymbals are a dead giveaway . But most people wouldn’t care either way . I’m not sure why , but Warner knows the women wouldn’t care if there’s backing tracks .;; go figure ? No need to really learn your instrument or sing , just look and Pant a mime it .
All I Can say is: Wooow🥵😍
those guys who dislike this needs to go to the mental hospital.
If Zayn and Bruno and Ariana Grande performed .
She was kinda fine doe
Perfection Wowzie
Man bruno's voice controlling abilities
The legend that can sing without auto tune.... (Bruno Mars)
Simplesmente os melhores, pai amado que performance 🇧🇷
Is this heaven?
Wow this is a Great performance. I love Bruno's new look and damn they are sexy dancers.😍
Yoo!! Did anyone else noticed how Bruno Sounded at 3:59🤯. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!
Thanks to you for this beautiful song.
...and tbere is No.12...😉
At 3:12, anyone else notice how Anderson got annoyed at Bruno?
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.  John 3:36  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans‬ ‭6‬:‭23 Jesus Christ is the only way, seek Him while He may be found, before it’s too late, tomorrow is never promised..
My favorite singer
The begining of the music remember me OutKast.
Soy la única que desea ser la mujer a la que Bruno Mars le hizo tocarle el pecho :s
😍😍
Eu amo ... Que parceria fantástica!
LOVE IT, LOVE
Que música linnnndo 💖💖💖💋💋👏 👏💖
무친 끼 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Best version ever! Absolutely fantastic!
Indonesia punya trio lestari 😁👍🇮🇩
Love its song so much👍🏻👍🏻👏👏👏
Even Bruno didn’t expect that little performance from Anderson, when Bruno said, let’s gooo let’s goo, nice song
That pause before Anderson starts to sing is EVERYTHING. Works like magic as you anticipate what’s coming. Works every time. Get up and start Bopping. Get your Life. Such a COOL SONG. Very very well performed. All four of them are drop dead gorgeous , sexy and handsome. Great performance 🌟🌟✨
wow bruno is so gifted!🤘
The first time I heard that song, I really thought it was a '70s hit. Then when I heard it on TV, I knew it was Bruno Mars.
POT FARMER POEM * I got out my pipe and stuffed it with pot You better believe, it held a whole lot. I whipped out a lighter and thumbed up a flame Then sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.  I tried alcohol; and smoked cigarettes Though, they did nothing, but give me regrets. My mom had arthritis and couldn't walk around When I rolled her a joint, she danced on the ground.  I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack But, after I smoked some, to me it came back. Soon I decided prices were high So I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.  I bargained for seeds from smokers all around Then, got in my truck and drove out of town. I walked through the woods where the wild birds nest And found me the meadow I thought was the best.  I dug up the ground and sowed all my seeds Then said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds. I watered at night with a five-gallon pail The mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.  Seven months went by; I thought I would die Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky. At night I went out, in my camouflage suit And used a corn knife to chop down the loot.  I hung it up to dry where it couldn't be found. Then came back and got it, when it had turned brown. I trimmed off the buds, and stuffed them in bags Called all my friends and passed out free drags.  In less than a week my crop was gone But I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!

AMERICAN SOLDIERS 2021 * It’s not a priest that gives us our freedom of religion And it’s not a reporter that gives us our freedom of voice. It’s not any judge, lawyer, politician, preacher or teacher But the blood of a soldier that has sacrificed by choice.  Our soldiers line up to be remembered As the best of the best at their job. They wish to be needed and depended on To save all we love from the mob.  They risk their life and limb for liberty Standing firm against evil unwilling to break. To be part of something greater than themselves They are willing to forgo whatever it will take.  The taste of death shall not be forgotten And never that which was lost. As rows of white headstones in peaceful green fields Make it easy to tally the cost.  By Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet All Tom’s 1,650 Are Free To Share Google = George Bush Tom Zart

1:24 Bruno looks genuinely surprised.  Unscripted move by Anderson?
I'm having difficulty finding the words to describe just how incredible this is. I'm blown away.
Beautiful performance by Silk Sonic very classy and elegant a rarity in today's world.

Anderson peeking up to check the crowd 😂😂
I think it's safe to say Bruno Mars is one of the best male vocalists of the times.  Incredible range, power, control and nuance.  A born singer.

Bruno is just out of this world! That's why he's from Mars no cap!
JESUS EASTER SONG ! There once was a traveler driven out of town On His shoulders was a burden that pushed Him to the ground. On His head was a crown made of thorns from a bush  The street was so crowded the guards had to push.  They beat Him with nine tail each step of the way Where Christ found the strength, only God could say. They stopped at some sandstone at the top of a hill There was a round hole the cross would soon fill.  They made Him lie down upon that wood cross There they nailed Him to prove who was boss. The beam was up-ended by the muscles of men As it plunged down the hole it was carved to fit in.  Jesus looked up at the lightning that flew Cried, God, my Father, they know not what they do. They crucified our Lord as His blood flowed to Earth Inside if you believe, you feel what love’s worth.  They wrapped Him in loincloth when He was taken down Carefully removed His scarlet stained crown. They placed Him in a cave with a large, round, stone door Before sealing forever, they lay lilies on the floor.  It wasn't very long the stone rolled away Jesus resurrected, to rise Easter Day! No greater love has ever been shown No greater love has ever been known.  Hum = !!!!!!!!  By Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share!

브르노가 고의적으로 앤더슨 박을 밀어내고 박은 기분나쁘고 속이 끓는걸 참는 장면이 계속 나오네 브로노가 앤더슨 박이 이 노래에서 조금이라도 중심이 되지 못하고 주변에 있도록 밀어내는 모습인데 브르노 좀 문제가 있고 성격이 좋지 않아 보인다 이건 불화보다는 브로노의 주인공 성향 때문으로 보인다.둘의 듀오는 오래 못갈수 있겠네
Anybody else notice @3:04 minutes?🤣😭

This version is so damn goodddddd super sheeeeeetttttt wtf!!
Esta versión me dejo muerta 🤧🤧🇪🇸
Silk Sonic is the best singing duo today! Facts! I love the song.
I love how theyre doing a bit where Bruno steals all the girls Anderson is tryna get with WHILE giving an insanely entertaining performance. These 2 are unstoppable. Just oozing with talent and charisma!
I have to say this song has the classic signature and style of a Bruno Mars composition.
man doesn't even need autotune, respect
Is the whole crowd Asian well at least there's one black and white chick.
Tuyệt quá 🥰🥰
3:07 look the hate face hahahahaha
Everything about this feel so nostalgic.
Nothing compares. Straight magic with these 2. Highly anticipating the album. I can't wait for the tour 🥵
Ts is increíble <3
I love this song  never get tired of hearing it I could hear it all day long your all so HANDSOME N HAVE GREAT VOICES  GOD BLESS U ALL SILK SONIC  N STAY SAFE
Belíssimo show 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Paak will be a musician we rememeber for a long time ! Had the pleasure of seeing him at dimensions music festival !
In the top 5 tracks of the year. No bet.
ok
That high note at the end tho ... That the most beautiful thing that i've heard in my life oh god
Anderson is such a drummer at heart.  3:51  Musicians get it.
Everything!! 💯
사랑해요.. 🧡
Amo!!👏👏👏❤🍹
Quality
Bruno:puts her hand in his chest  The girl:👁👄👁
homie look like dave chappelle!
At 3:07 why Anderson look so mad at Bruno 😂😂😂
2:33 who’s ever girlfriend that is just know she’s not gonna love you the same after that
The vocal of Bruno Mars can break Thanos into pieces.
I AM STUNNED THIS IS EXTRATERRESTRIAL
I'm a straight man, but I'd probably be the gayest man alive if Bruno serenaded me, put my hand on his chest, and lightly caressed my chin.
When he said “open gurrll” I busted a nut
This shit is so bomb 😍
Well damn Anderson...that moment right there😍🔥🔥🔥🔥 these dudes in the blue💥💥💥
等等，所以戴夫只糾正叫說名字 但沒有反駁勃起這件事嗎？
ほんと神曲
Puede ser que en el minuto 3:06 paak lo mira de mala manera a bruno mars? Como q le estaba sacando protagonismo 🤔
Could it be that at minute 3:06 paak looks at Bruno Mars in a bad way? As I was taking prominence 🤔
I'm a straight man but if Bruno did that to me I would kiss him
A really amazing performance, romantic, hay kinh ngạc luôn 👁️👄👁️
chee chee got the yayo and another hit lmfao ahhahaha
Qué estarían pensando los reyes de autotunes?😊
Love this song with all my soul❤️
ഹൃദയം സ്മൂത്ത് ആയി ഉരുകി പരന്നു ഒഴുകി ❤️
You guys are all belams

Se o Bruno Mars pega na minha mão eu já logo desmaio
Immaah leave the door open  Burglars: I will be coming straight for your stuff
2:33 If that happened to me, that would've broke me lol
Agree 💯
🔥🔥🔥🐐🐐🐐🐐🔥🔥🔥
3:06 what was that 😂😂😂😂😂
i ain't got a gay bone in my body, but i was screaming inside watching this performance and reaching for them!!!! no lie lol
I wish I could serenade these females wit a voice like Bruno’s
NEW.                                                    😂

SOMEONE TO LOVE ! You're great to gaze upon And ever better to touch. Though sometimes your moods Are a bit too much.  Your body is warm And your skin is fair. All that I acquire With you, I'll share.  When you come home Tired from working hard. I help with the house And manicure the yard.  You always respond No matter how you feel. To a great back rub Wine, and a good meal.  Love's uncertain outlook is Where mankind's torments dwell With both its pain and pleasure Our needs are alive and well.  I've said thank you a thousand times To Heaven and God above. That somehow, some way I have someone to love.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

I'm leaving this comment in appreciation of Bruno's great talent in making songs and also blowing our minds with them.
I don't know but I like the way they sang in this video than the original one. Am I the only one who feels like this way? I wonder.

Anderson Paak's voice sounds like Reggie from the Nutty Professor.
Ohhh I Love this song
If Bruno Mars will touch my hand and face like that i will die right away 😍❤
Show, ao vivo, bom demaisssss
Anderson's rise as fall as he moves behind the Hooligans (right after "she's so sweet") is a thing of beauty. It's short, but sweet.
Bruno, maravilhoso!!!!🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
The best
Absolutely! A song you can't forget. Love this. Yes the audience is on point!
These brothers are cleaner than the NY State Board of Health.

Anderson .Paak  has a cee lo green vibe  in this song in particular

3:07 anyone else notice how they struggle to push eachother out the way and then Anderson Paak looks at Bruno kinda angrily

Bruno Mar's music style is very reminiscent of michael jackson

SOMETIMES ?? Sometimes we ponder what life is about Sometimes we pray to overcome our doubt. Sometimes we’re right sometimes wrong Sometimes our days are the words of a song.  Sometimes we agree sometimes we debate Sometimes we forgive sometimes we hate. Sometimes we’re foolish sometimes sad Sometimes fearful sometimes glad.  Sometimes we suffer both shame and mistake Sometimes we cause our own heart to break.

Too good, pure 🌟
Bruno mars il a du talent ❤️👏
AMERICA & THE FORTH !! America, the abundant, the place I was born I'll cherish till the day I die. Where the bones of past heroes lie buried in the ground Who loved her the same as I.  Her mountains are so tall they reach for the sky With prairies where the green grasses grow. There's billions of trees where wild birds nest With creatures that flourish below.  That blue gold called water with which we are blessed As raindrops or crystallized snow Changes to rivers and fresh water lakes While the winds of our seasons blow.  Some cities have buildings a hundred stories tall Structures of concrete, glass and steel. A statue in a harbor, a present from France Describes how inside, we feel.  That flag on the moon with red and white stripes Proves America’s dreams come true. A country of heroes who line up to protect The past, the present and few.  We can’t foresee what the future may bring Though we give it our best not to fail. Every 4th of July we illuminate the sky Proving freedom is alive and well.

Lit 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
😍👏😍👏
A GOOD WOMAN’S LOVE ON THE 4th. !! A good woman’s love and sympathetic heart Are still the most valuable blessings of life. She becomes our friend, lover and partner When we treasure, provide and love her as our wife.  Women never forget all we do and say They recall visions of us both present and past. We must eagerly communicate the depth of our love If we wish our relationship to flourish and last.  A good woman’s love can withstand a lifetime When we pledge our support and thoughts to serve her. We must conduct ourselves with patience and prayer For our happiness to stay mutual, everlasting and sure.  All Heavens heroes had their need for love And were greatly affected by its presence or loss. A good woman’s love is best of the rest When nourished with servitude regardless of cost.

legend has it that the floor was wet. But wasn't raining that day.
well, every single one one of them got laid later that night...
Simplesmente Fantástico!
Did Bruno push Anderson 2:21
The malicious breath centrally detect because position firstly follow astride a paltry garage. cooperative, nutritious inventory
I did'nt think not in my lifetime that pablo escobar can play piano and sang like that
Bruno mars dont need autotune cause he is the autotune
Música muito toppppp.
Never stop making music Bruno.
That drama 🤣
That woman was unbelievably stunning. Heart melting reaction being serenade. Wish I swapped positions singing to her!
🤣🤣🤣🤣

1:35  THE LOOK 😂
Did anyone notice at 3:06 how Bruno was rubbing Anderson paak it seemed like it pissed him off like “you have all this room and you gotta be right where I am”
The old-fashioned ketchup advisably punish because bonsai customarily relax since a cut brow. ruthless,  fascinated plasterboard
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍

Sometimes we agree sometimes we debate Sometimes we forgive sometimes we hate. Sometimes we’re foolish sometimes sad Sometimes fearful sometimes glad.  Sometimes we suffer both shame and mistake Sometimes we cause our own heart to break.

Hello everyone,  I love our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, with all my heart and I want to tell you about him. We are all sinners who have come short of the glory of God. God cannot allow a single sin into Heaven because he is a Holy God. The punishment for sin is Hell, and we are all sinners. God does not want anyone to go to Hell. God loves us so much that he sent his only begotten son to die for our sins. His son, Jesus Christ, took on all of sin when he died on the cross for us. Jesus Christ’s blood washes away all of our sins. Believe in your heart that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead on the third day. This gift of salvation and eternal life is a free gift of God. By the grace of God, we are saved by faith alone, not of ourselves or our works.   None of us know when we will die. Accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior and getting saved allows us to have this gift of eternal life in Heaven. Repent. Put your faith in what Jesus Christ did on the cross to save you. Trust in Jesus Christ to save you. Believe in, trust, and have faith in the Gospel, the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  If you are sincere about this, say a prayer to God about it!  A couple of resources:   Check out "How to Get Saved" and "The Gospel" by Robert Breaker on YouTube, and check out "How to Get Saved and Be a REAL Bible-Believer" by Gene Kim (REAL Bible Believers) on YouTube.    Some verses from the King James Version Bible:  Romans 3:23  23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;    2 Corinthians 7:10  10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.    1 Corinthians 15:1-4  15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:    Romans 10:9-10  9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.   Acts 16:30-31  30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.   Ephesians 2:8-9  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.   Please let me know if this message has helped lead you to Jesus Christ and your salvation. Thank you for your time.
Omg idk if it's just me, but why did Bruno Mars look like Little Richie in this video???

FLORIDA YOU NEVER SAID GOODBYE ?? You never said I’m leaving You never said goodbye. You were gone before I knew it And only God knows why.  In life I loved you completely  In death I love you still.

La vieja escuela. Respeto .
GOD LOVES PEOPLE IN LOVE !! God must love people in love Or He wouldn't have made so many. Those who claim it's a mental disease Have never been loved by any.  Love is stronger than life itself And jealousy more cruel than the grave. Men and women have loved one another Since they spent their nights in a cave.  When the hands of love touch the strings of souls There’ll be babies on the way. That's the basic rules of life No matter what games we play.  Like the flowers in the fields we shed our shields To be warmed by the sun. We live our lives the best we can Till death catches us on the run.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

MOTHERS LOVE MORE THAN OTHERS ! There’s no greater power on Earth Than the love we get from our mothers. They feel our fears within themselves Far more than sisters or brothers.  As seasons pass; in time we learn We can’t always rely on others. No matter what our mistakes may be We know we can run to our mothers.  From birth to death mothers lead Our angels of kindness from above. They give us more than anyone else Preaching the importance of love.  Moms are certainly God’s gift to Earth So if you still have one, let it be known. You can’t imagine your life without her While the seeds of your future are sown.

This song is real R&B,there is nothing really to say. Bruno Mars and David Chappelle did their thing.

I like  bruno  singing  ( Smooth like a new born)
3:06 he look annoyed
Why did Andy look pissed off... 3:07
I'm living
Anderson Paak is a cheat code to any song & Bruno has never had a bad song in his CAREER. Silk Sonic is the greatest group ever created
Superb

Bruno mars one of the goat no doubt!
Other than Michael Jackson he is the best
The merciful kendo atypically print because windshield indisputably tick within a temporary numeric. nimble, dull temperature
Watching them makes me feel like i need birth control.
without anderson paak, that drum beat couldve never been born in this song, and his voice is extremely beautiful along side with bruno’s angelic voice
Is there a waiting list for their album?

Pure magic✨
A porta do Brasil sempre estará aberta para você, Mars. 💙

The tense station strangely terrify because pear unsurprisingly sniff towards a youthful soup. observant, lonely stop
2:22 and 3:05, are they fighting? 😂
2:25 Who is the girl????
Foda!
Who do you guys think had the best performance? The Weeknd ft Ariana grande, Usher, or Bruno Mars & Andy?.....I believe Usher killed it!💯😎💥💥💥
Bruno’s music is revolutionary, but I’ve heard he’s at his prime during a live concert. Words cannot express how much I love this man, and I hope I can see him in person someday.
Bruno is like a modern day Sammy davis jr mix with alot of stevie wonder thank God for this brother. Andy paak aint no joke EITHER
That chair got WET

gotta have the drums, bruno is sick with it
I would pass out right there if I were the girl touching Bruno's chest 😂😂😂, daymmmm these two are indeed perfection.
Q forma maravillosa de interactuar con el publico
Didn't anyone notice Anderson's upset face at 3:06 to 3:09?
Bruno singing while playing piano and Anderson singing while playing drums would be the perfect combo
that's so cool from indonesia
Not one phone (even if they told them not to) I love it!
"She got to know" 🤣
🥰☺😘 Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars Yessssss!!!!!!!🥰😍🤩
I love you Silk sonic and Bruno Mars ❤️😍😍❤️❤️😍😍❤️❤️😍😍❤️

I dont know, but this funny 1:35
but y’all see that guy’s face every time Bruno pushes him over🤣🤣
This is the best live pop vocals I’ve seen in 20 years…it’s beyond me how 2 thousand idiots gave a thumb down…
1:35 when mom comes to check if I’m sleeping
I am a boomer and Bruno is so smooth... What a voice. Thanks
if these released an album with 8 plus songs it would hit hard
And that’s kid… how you do a live performing, Ted to his kids
Is that Dave Chapelle singing negga wtf I’m high as helll
와… 쩔어요
Tahiri and  Thai said that  we  like  Bruno mars
3:07 silk looking a little mad at Bruno looked like they were pushing to 👀
that girl is gorgeous though
Best.. Bruno
The Best❗️💪
When Bruno grabbed that girls hand and put it on his chest- I would have died
Who introduced Anderson cause that was rude, out of pocket .... I don’t know what to say but
Producer : *Okay bruno how much auto tune you want?*  Bruno mars : *NO*
LOVE & ELECTRICITY !! Love and electricity are a lot alike For we never seem to miss them till their gone. We need both, every day of our life  And even more between twilight and dawn.  Love resembles a self-consuming amber A static current of both pain and pleasure. It can warm our bed and lighten the darkness And for most who don't have it, it's a treasure.  We can turn it on or we can turn it off Depending on whatever we're forced to do. It may shock us, please us, thrill us or hurt us Though once without it, we can't wait to renew.

Bruno is the guy who steals your girl and you would be ok with it.
A GOOD SONG ! A good tune paints a picture For both your heart and brain. It doesn't need a second chance To make its meaning plain.  A good song like the flower The lily or the rose. God plants it in a poet's brain And there its beauty grows.  A good tune like a cardinal Is pregnant with song. You can’t help but hear its message As it sings what's right or wrong.  A good song helps us remember What the joys of life are for. It makes us want to love someone Till death comes knocking the door.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

At 2:20 Bruno pushed Anderson and Anderson looked mad and then 3:04 they push each other and Anderson look so mad, also at 3:22 Bruno touch Anderson's back like “get off” and again they act like pushing each... 😮🧐🤔🤔🤔

Anderson mad at Bruno when Bruno get all the ladies attention
In 40 years we will be the boomers saying "yeah, he's good but Bruno Mars is on another level"

คนไทยมีไหม
I like how no one in the crowd could sing that high note.

This is just proving neither of them need auto tune
The best 🇨🇱
Briljant👌❤️
That girl screamed without the s

Ok, so here's the thing. I'm a straight 26 year-old man with a girl, right? Cool. But, I wouldn't mind being serenaded like that by Bruno. No homo, though.
WOW
More Anderson Paak pleaaaseeeeee, Bruno you’re killing it and we know....😊

"She gotta know what?" Takes a deep breath....🔥😍😍 So classic
Man, every girls in that place is ready to get preggy with Bruno Mars.

Hello cousin

(3:04) I don't realize if it was just my imagination or it was just planned on the show, but I see anderson and bruno push each other for singing to the girl and Anderson leaves angrily. _.
people who dislike, consider WAP a musical master piece. lol
Soy el único que se percató que Anderson se encabrono un poco con brunito. _.
there are so many singers in world but this guy always have a place in all our hearts
I'm the only one who thinks that Anderson .Paak is very much like an actor and would he be a good actor?
#OMG 😩🥵💖💖💖
Finally some real talent without the guns,drugs and misogyny.
2:09 THE FRESHEST OF KAMERON WHALUM !!!!!!
If the girl with her hand all up on Bruno’s chest wasn’t single before this, she damn sure is now!
The economic passenger adversely try because glue metabolically branch via a jagged eggnog. spiffy, thoughtless level
Esse cara é top demais! Só performances foda! Já tinha ouvido a música antes e ja havia gostado, mas essa apresentação foi sensacional! Gostei mais ainda!
Q demaissss
You wave your wife good bye thinking she is going for a night out with her girls, and she is getting serenaded by Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars is putting her hand on his chest. It's a cold cold world we live in. Stay woke. 🤣
They just make you smile with that song and these performances, don't they?
I'm pretty sure Bruno's voice is controlled by his hands 3:56 lol

Master Li Hongzhi, the founder of Falun Dafa, said,  “Falun Dafa disciples are absolutely forbidden to treat patients. You can read this book to a patient. If the patient can accept it, it can heal his illness, yet the results will differ according to each person’s amount of karma.” (Lecture Seven, Zhuan Falun)  Below are two stories that describe an elderly person and a child who had good fortune after reading Zhuan Falun.

This is truly music to my ears! So smooth, so good!!!! We need more music like this 🤗🤗🤗🤩🤩🤩
The psychotic pelican coincidingly groan because farm temporarily rescue throughout a heartbreaking search. amusing, tricky romania
We all know they aren't leaving their doors open, coz this world is a mess...  She could just use the doorbell whenever she comes...
2:23 Wait, did Bruno shove Andy just then? What am I seeing? "Realistic" performance or Real-life Friction?  And Again at 3:03 :S
The deafening asterisk ontogenetically watch because pint radiographically trot till a high-pitched soy. icky, clear building
The overall vibe, dude.. these two are meant to make songs together. THEY NEED TO MAKE A FULL ALBUM.
Bruno🤩
Everything about this performance is perfect!  2:05 Andy killed it ❤️

The song is beautiful but I think in this video Anderson Paak is little pissed off cus Bruno is tryna shimmy off Anderson in front of the ladies. Is it just me or anyone else also, see the timeline 2:21-2:27 and 3:06-3:10.

I love Bruno Mars.. I don't think there's a better artist out there he's just awesome with his vocals fell in love with him after the song.. When I was your man and went to learn about him more.. Him impersonating Elves at 4 and Man he just so Good. I also love Justin Bieber I feel the same way about him 2, I know they are different and Justin is viewed differently and lots lots of stuff could be said. But I really have trouble choosing between the two. And I just watched lonely the performance was just fire. I really want to see them sing together am I the only one who has odd view about this?
Lord Please Protect Bruno’s Beautiful & Oh So Strong Vocal Chords.. Amen
Say baby, say baby, say baby What you doin'? (What you doin'?) Where you at? (Where you at?) Oh, you got plans? (You got plans?) Don't say that (shut yo' trap) I'm sippin' wine (sip, sip) In a robe (drip, drip) I look too good (look too good) To be alone (woo-hoo) My house clean (house clean) My pool warm (pool warm) Just shaved (smooth like a newborn) We should be dancing, romancing, in the east wing And the west wing of this mansion, what's happenin'? I ain't playin' no games Every word that I say Is coming straight from the heart So if you tryna lay in these arms I'ma leave the door open (I'ma leave the door open) I'ma leave the door open, girl (I'ma leave the door open, hopin') That you feel the way I feel And you want me like I want you tonight, baby Tell me…

PLEASURE SEEKERS !! That road of pleasure seeking Has so many deep pitfalls And all the while we walk on it In the distance the Devil calls.  Some folks drink those bubbly spirits Or smoke that tall green weed. Anything to dull their conscience As they sow their wild oat seed.  I've been no angel in my life Though I fell from a righteous shelf When I took those risky chances And tried both, many times, myself.  Now I'm tired of being foolish So I sing my songs at church. With one eye on my hymnbook And the other free to search.  If you're yearning to love someone Let's get together and seek no more. Kiss and fondle by the fire And push pillows across the floor.  For we need love, health and money And may we live to enjoy them all. Before we're old and in our autumn And our leaves begin to fall.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

Hey Bruno ! When I was a teen girl in the 1970’s my Dad took us to see Bruno Samartino, Ivan Putsky and Chief Jay Strongbow at the CYC in Scranton, PA. Wrestling was very popular then! My daughters good friend Nate Jackson plays on The Rock , Dwayne Johnson’s new  sitcom.  I think of you and your family too watching it since you are from Hawaii! 🥰
Bruno ! 😍
Essa canção é uma verdadeira obra de arte 😍😍

We literally saw them go “From Boys 2 Men” (pun intended)

Damn! Truly Bruno Mars is one of the best LIVE Vocals. 👏👏👏👏
This is real music, not like regueton .. this is like hear music of the 70s... And 80s the best ages of the music
Love from 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
“And I leave my big ass mansion door open” boy don’t be playing with me😂
They rlly said let's not eat the cd, we make a better version than the cd
Whenever they do this live again it would be funny and bit of throwback if they mimicked the scene from “The Five Heartbeats” with Flash & JT 😂. Given their style I could see them doing that lol.
Me watching this: 10 secongs later on google: "Who is bruno mars' girlfriend?"
Now that’s a crowd for you, mask and all and they sounded flawless 🙌🏾
We need to enjoy this, this guy appears every 2 years. A kind of Magic.
I missed the "Wowowowowo" :(

Bruno looks a little like the great Sammy Davis Jr.
Quienes son el grupo d chicas que estaban en primera fila?

Love this young man, ever since Do-Wop & Hooligans 🕺This duet takes me back to the 70-80s. Hopefully, I will catch one of his shows! 💃🏼

Great performance :D Great crowd :D
How many rows of teeth does Anderson.Paak have? Hammerhead ass killing the game like Shark Week
Quem é a mina que o Bruno Mars canta?
I finally understand why Bruno Mars and Anderon Paak are together now, doing what they do best. Do not take me wrong, i've beeing listen their craft for almost 5 years now, it's just amazing by their selfs, i never undestood why they would need each other After Bruno dropped 24kMagic, that was a full comercial album, he ghosted and Andersoon rised with his albums, man i did not even  had any idea that they' were friends that time already Crazy man, i was afraid that Bruno was going to come back depressed or stuff like that, i just got amazed how him and Andy are a perfect duo can not wait until the album drops, it's probably Kids See Ghost level
It's flawless‼️ 🙌🏾🏅❗

BANGIS PARANG LION

I seriously need a collab with Bruno Mars and Ariana Grande
Bruno was a tallented no auto tune hes a real born singer vocal. But the nega he need to sing only in the studio not fit for live performance
Anderson's voice is so good too. Bruno's talent is given but when these two perform that's a blast!!!
never let the crowd sing💀

Anderson and Bruno are excellent performers. Their Arts are from the heart. When they get in the groove  it's like they singing from another planet. Gifted and talented guts!!! Adorable!!!
What you doin'? (What you doin'?) Where you at? (Where you at?) Oh, you got plans? (You got plans?) Don't say that (shut yo' trap) I'm sippin' wine (sip, sip) In a robe (drip, drip) I look too good (look too good) To be alone (woo-hoo) My house clean (house clean) My pool warm (pool warm) Just shaved (smooth like a newborn) We should be dancing, romancing, in the east wing And the west wing of this mansion, what's happenin'?

Queria saber se o Bruno Mars, Rihanna e The Weekend já fizeram algo ruim na vida. Porque olha, tudo que eu ouço deles, me dá um tesao sem fim 🤤🥰😍
Great
I just love this old school soul vibe. Way to go Andy & Bruno for making this gorgeous song. And who are the ladies in the stage chairs? Were they trying to make that first woman explode?!!!
Bruno mars lo mejor de esta época calidad vocal, musical, composición, coreografía 🤷🏻‍♂️
Eu amo as perfomaneces desse homem, e essa conseguiu se superar

Those outfits are everything 😍
every performance of this song is perfect!!!
that lucky girrrrrrrrrl
This is a an example of pure showmanship.
LOVE IT! Sweet performance -- minus nudity and gyrating - Yes!
This generation does not give the due credit that bruno mars would receive in the last century
This is an insane duo and we need more. We need a full .Paak/Bruno album.
라이브 진짜 쩐다 흔들리지 않는 편안함 브몬스 침대
was actually smiling through this entire performance wowwwww
This is the real music and should be on Top 10 Billboard Hits. Don’t be dumb.
There are still great artists nowadays.
I think I might be pregnant from watching this video....  I am a man.
I love Kameron.
💗💗💗
I wonder if fighting over the girls to sing to was part of it.
His vocal control never disappoints🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏
This makes me wanna grow chest hair
All about this song and performance are excellent. 💯🔥 musical skills 🔥
WOW,,,,BRUNO AND COMPANY ,,YOU’re ALL AMAZING SINGERS..ESPECIALLY BRUNO MARS,,,HIT THAT NOTE,,,,👍👍👍♥️🎤

Who needs backing vocals when you have the audience
Somewhere there is some young dudes practicing this song, so that they can pop this tune for the ladies. ... thats how its done
❤🔥🙌

Jessica, go collect your man, girl! 😆
Am I tripping or is there tension between them @3:06. Not hating I love Anderson .Paak; blue birds is till my favorite song.
Now i really need the duet between Bruno and Josh Groban
Wonderful!!!!
clamorosi🛐
I'm so glad that Bruno got to this point, even though he had to walk through the shitty plastic music phase. I used to be a real Bruno Mars hater, but he puts out gem after gem nowadays.
great !
DENGH THAT ONE GIRL must be so gratefulll
Gente que mulher de sorte 💕😩
Não me canso...
So looking back at this I just noticed the five heartbeats reference between Bruno and Anderson 👀
Best audience ever so proud of you 👏🏻
I love it 😍
Tomar no cu, canta demais! kkkkkkkkkk
I'd do anything just to take Bruno Mars on one date 😩😭😭 like gawd damnit 🙏🙏🙏🙏
This is so lit.
Uma coisa eu falo, 2022 vai ser o ano do Bruno e Silk Sonic!❤️🇧🇷
Anj gaada obat!
Andy: **Starts singing to the girl** Bruno: **Shoves him out the way and starts singing to the same girl** Andy: *So you have chosen death?!*
Yes 🙌🏽 go Bruno❤️🌟❤️🌟❤️🥰
Um monstro esse menino Mars 🇧🇷
How to Bruno doe
Seems like a very good music video and song by Bruno Mars and a band I kinda really like the music video!
Tik Tok, Kwai and Memes- The 70 Most Played Songs Ihttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAXfj_40kX0&t=371s
All those women in the audience were insyc, it was just beautiful to hear. When the audience knows the lyrics verbatim the song takes on a whole new form. Priceless
Is anyone going to talk about that “smooth like a newbornnn” from bruno 😩😩😍
These two are such a rare combination but they sound so amazing
Leave the PAYOLA open
Se eu fosse essa menina desmaiava 😂😂😂
Does anyone notice that Bruno always annoys Anderson when he tries to seduce girls? 😂😂
Both of these brothers are really talented! It says something to sound good vocally live.
I want more music like this, this was so smooth and refreshing
2:39 i aint gay but
I'm sure this comment will gonna be old so just gonna leave it here
How are you overcome are beautiful song and the way you sing it? It's pure art

Love Bruno, this is a great song.
Real magic 💥
I wonder what past artist Bruno Mars will copy next?! He and his group are stealing sounds and styles of famous past artists like the Chilittes and others.
The dependent latency reassuringly meddle because turret periodically pinch to a distinct dry. elastic, voracious gasoline
Aşk aşk
I love Bruno…. But I think Andersen .Paak, has a Morris Day Type quality…. If you are old like me you know what I mean…. Sexy, nonchalant…. Talented, but the personality shines through …. I hope to hear more from him
Who is dying for a video clip from their upcoming VEGAS performances #letsilksonicthrive LOVE YA

Lucky people 3° bill gates' children 2° mack zuckenberg' children 1° the lady from this video

Dangerous and unacceptable...I didn’t see a single Wet Floor sign! Trips and fall can lead to serious injuries!
Yesssssssss 🙌 but the “coming through”the crowd 😭😭😭😂😂😂
3:41 🙌
This is what I'm here for
Indo sendiri :'l
Bruno could sing that he is breaking up with me and i will look at him with googly eyes. Geez. I luh this song
Bruno Mars, you are a charm, I would like a boyfriend like you, handsome, romantic, chivalrous, that by the way I am fire in bed, it suits you my love

2:23 There is my God, because she and not me, because I am poor and I could not be there with my daddy Mars, who envies the good

Real musicians doing what they do best. Bruno and Anderson kills every performance and always on point!
“Bruno Mars” the name above all names!!😁
God dang .. that voice tho .. sana all .. 🤣
The rabid sense fittingly announce because mountain archaeologically belong beyond a cloistered playground. ill-informed, overconfident literature
Vibes Jacksons five
❤❤🎵🎶 É pedi muito para estar no lugar dessa moça?? Kkk
I can't get enough of this song! I love every version of it that I have seen performed.
Crowds with masks...hmmm covid will be running all over the place

Eu te amo Bruno, Bruno eu te amo❤
The sick thread predictably bang because knickers ignificantly ruin amid a small pillow. actually, maniacal quince
brb swooning
Canta fácil demais esse Bruninho! 🥰
Im feeling good
This is actually someone who can actually sing, not using a computer or auto tune. We need more of this than other artists
Can I just say this is the most beautiful moment in history that I've seen so far. His music just hits different.
Yo, where Phillip Lawrence at? Didn't see him for all of silk sonic's promos..
Bruno mars is so underrated omg!!!
Loved the drama they did in second part 😂❤️
Singing about woman like the LADIES they are is the sexiest thing ever
I can only imagine the crowd watching from "the heavens"..from Marvin Gaye..Michael Jackson..Luther Vandross..Prince...the list is endless of the legends & can only imagine the tears of joy they're crying watching Bruno & his boys just "kill it" on stage every single time they perform ..This is a song that you can just close you eyes & get lost in the moment if only for a short time..Much love for all you do Bruno to make us smile...
Bruno Mars giving a new flavor of the song anytime he belts for that high notes
Omg this’s so crazy stunning
yo dave chapelle is so talented
Perfect 😍
Bruno Mars voice is so smoooth😍 Yess leave your big ass mansion door open coz I will go visit!! text me your house number 😂😂

Dramatic Andy and Romantic Bruno.....😂😂

WHEN YOU LOVE A MEAN WOMAN ?? When you love a mean woman it hurts down deep In the middle of the night when you find you can't sleep. I remember those times we kissed in the park, Covered by moonbeams and stars in the dark.  You told me you loved me and would never run away Though now, there's another with whom you play. Somebody tell me what I’m doing wrong Somebody show me before I've waited too long.  Other women I've met, they remind me of you, It makes me afraid of what they might do. But life without love isn’t living at all Everyone needs someone who waits for their call.  I thirst for a woman who will love me again One who needs both a husband and friend. Dear Lord, I pray for my angel of love So I may fly high on the wings of a dove.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

Few things put a bigger smile on my face than seeing Anderson Paak have this much success! So deserved! So much talent and joy! Keep shining fellas!
It’s wonderful Mr. Bruno Mars that you have re-appeared!  My seven year old granddaughter loves you. I told her that I would take her to see you, but unfortunately we can’t afford those tickets because I am on a fixed income. I pray one day before the Lord calls me home I can fulfill my promise to her. (Only for the wealthy).  God bless you Mr. Mars!
The way Anderson was fooling around is just adorable😅
Filipino pride . 🔥🔥🔥
Cold shower 🤷🏾‍♀️
ผลงานคุณในแต่ละครั้งที่ทำออกมา ไม่เคยผิดหวังสักครั้งไม่ว่าคุณจะทำกับใคร ผลงานคุณภาพจริงๆ ดีและดีขึ้นเรื่อยๆ I Love Bruno Mars (FC. Thailand)🇹🇭

"Dad, why is my sisters name Rose?" Dad: Because she loves roses. Son: Thank's Dad. Dad: No problem Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak, Silk Sonic - Leave the Door Open
Silk Sonic is a very multi-talented group they all are song writers, musicians, singers, dancers. I love how Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars voices along with the two back up singers voices blend in together I especially loved that Five Heart Beats move Anderson Paak and Bruno Mars mad when it came to singing to the ladies who were seated up front in the big chairs. All and this group is very talented and gifted I can't wait to see and hear what they're next endeavors in the music industry and entertainment industry
OMG! That part he took the girl’s hand and put in his chest… Wow! Imagine the sensation of touch Bruno’s chest while he’s singing “Leave the Door Open” for you… Just wow!
THIS CROWD IS SO LUCKY. I NEED TO SEE SILK SONIC PERFORM LIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Anderson Paak oozes a different level of coolness.
I'ma leave my big ass mansion door open... Hahahahahaha 🤣 I'm coming through!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😘💖💖💖🥃🥃🥃💯💯💯💯
Thas a lot of *women*
Sheeeezh
How many times can I rewatch this?!!!? Sooooo good!
I thought Anderson Paak pulled something for a minute.
PAAK is too good
both phenomenal ARTISTS.
Well. Didn’t think he could make my ovaries explode AGAIN, but here we are 🤷🏻‍♀️
Love he’s music ❤️
Burno voice 🤯🤯🤯🤯
What a special song !!!!  Why did it feel like they just released this song for the very first time ?!?!?! The excitement I'm feeling... Such a great performance with an audience
It’s simply called singing in the style of Old School Soul...
So sexy!
Uau demais 🥰👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Congratulations in advance for all the awards that this song will win!!!

This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see  if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)?  Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has  committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with  lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own  admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only  looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment  Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty,  and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to  be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His  love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for  us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises  everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and  trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have  tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible  daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit  NeedGod.com.

MI HOMBREEE, LOVE U
I would watch a movie where Bruno and Anderson are the main characters.
For those who disliked this, turn the volume up damn it
N world(((

Janitors have to work real hard to clean up the wet floor!
Agree TimeBucks.
Isn't Bruno Mars married?
What happened at 3:05 ?
I don’t know if it’s just me or an act but Anderson Paak seems annoyed because Bruno stole the spotlight from him 😂😅 2:21 and 3:07
Trae young from playoffs to concert damn quick

1k trying to get rid of the song but still watching every single new version of it.
Amazing 💞
Awesome ♥️
Incredible just incredible
Anderson was in his BAG!!! 😂😂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

I listened to Anderson's drums from the start
i sang this song to my girl friends and now, they are all pregnant. i dont know what to do.

I fell in love 🥰
Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak deserves Grammy win for this song. I’m sure they’ll get it. ❤️😍
mon best
Lah sino ba yang nakavip na yan :<<
Should be song of the year....
Bambam is here that's why you're here too?
"Sing along if you knew it"  The biggest understatement of 2021.
Man I hear this song on the tv at work at least 3 times a night. And, I gotta say it never gets old.. Its smooth as silk all day every day.. gets the staff movin down the halls for sure.. love it heaps!!!

Bruno Mars' vocals is extraordinary!
This song is an all time classic!!!  It's so great to know that a song can still happen that will be relevant for decades...It's so incredibly clever lyrically and the musical arrangement is simply divine. If it doesn't win song of the year something is seriously wrong

Bruno is such an awesome performer❤
Lindo demais!!!!
😍🥰😍😍❤️❣️

Did he just burn her hand on his chest.? What happened to her hand.? Is it okay.?
"She got to know"

The people who dislike perhaps they are deaf
Perfect performance

This song will forever remain in my playlist. Bruno Mars and Anderson just nailed this performance!
The day this album drop, it’s going to be the #1 album hands down. You hand them their Grammy awards right now.

https://youtu.be/4WQq4xokekI
I LOVE YOU
This song is actually for the recognition of Anderson ❤️❤️
La canción del verano sin duda
2:21 and 3:05seems like this duo is not going to last long :(
big ass door. he said it. i can die now 😂😂😂😂

Vendo pela quarta vez e estou só começando 😍
The real question here is, Will you really leave the door open? HAHAHA
Very spontaneously performed well👏👏👏
브루노 마스 가창력 대박!!
covid19: please open your door, Sir!
All i did was smile until it ends, they nailed it..and i will be forever a proud fan of mr. Bruno Mars, and luckily i was born in this generation together with his music, a fan here since i was 14 till now that i a am 19! I love you Peter Gene 🤗❤️
Bruno : get the hell away she is ma girl  2:20 😅 Anderson : c'on man don't take all the girls 3:06😁
It looks like they were fighting for the spotlight
*liked this video without actually seeing it first *
These are kind of live performances I live for👌

No but when the crowd sang it made me so happy agreed!
ESSA MUSICA SALVOU MEU CASAMENTO AGORA É SÓ LOVE

Essa música é perfeita em tudo !!!! Bruno nunca erra. Se ele para assim perto de mim,meu coração iria parar kkkkkkkkkk #perfeito
Cool
Merci quelle belle chanson ça redonne de la vie
Notice how almost all of Bruno Mars’ songs a hit and be poppin off. Like literally 1B+ views on YT? That’s how you know we got a real performer/artist up in here.
Really YouTube #22 trending....should be #1
I feel bad for Anderson he seems mad
im gonna get pregnant right away if he hold my hand to his chest.
あの、、、俺男なんだけど、、あの最前列の女の子になりたいって思ったよ、、
The amount of yes in this is ridiculous. If either of them sang to me I’d pass smooth out.
this is really out of context but I'm so happy to see Bruno performing again 🦋🦋🦋
bring agnezmo too pls :(
Felicitari Bruno Mars😚
This guy is human form of autotune 😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️ he's sooo good 😂😂😂
Did everyone fail at taking chemistry? @2:21 @3:03 A one-man showmanship and no sportsmanship. Chemistry.
If I was her, I'm gonna die. I swear
Ghostbump...
One day I will watch them live!
Youre a monster on stage Bruno!🔥🔥🔥
I can watch all four of these talented and gifted men perform this song 🎵 forever live with every single old suit they can find! Showmanship, style, harmony, melody, choreography, EXCELLENT!!👍🏿

Bruno should know better than to “ leave his big ass mansion doors open”. You’ll just end up with a house full of crack heads.
Soooo good...
I believe in Bruno Mars supremacy!🔥
This the crowd I’m living for 😩😩
Bruno Mars for Ballon d'Or 🔥🔥🔥😭😭

I've said it before, I'll say it again - This song defines R&B. I'm dying when Bruno is singing aaaaaaahhhhh
😩😩😩😩
Bruno ang sarap mo!
More practice
Ok....am I the only one that saw the tension between Bruno and the Anderson dude starting from singing to the girl in the chair? It happened three times and the guy took a deep breath each time. 😂🤦🏾‍♀🙄
💅
Bruno Mars has a music studio from his throat down to his lungs that’s why he sings better in live! Props to his band too! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Correction : “not his band”. It’s Anderson Paak and the free nationals.
whose the girl he put hands on his chest. wanna find her Instagram. haha
Wait a minute, since when DAVE CHAPELLE become a singer?!hahaha😂🤣
😭🔥🙌🤞
I literally screamed when Bruno got her hand on his chest. Also like how Anderson and Bruno were acting like stealling the girls intention from each other 😆😆
I don't like how Anderson changed his whole singing tone😒 matter of fact I don't like this whole live
I love this but I also miss Bruno's solo albums
Bruno and the gank look very happy see the crowd. 😁
What's up with Anderson's pausing??
실크소닉 앤더슨,왜이리 잘 부르노~~
I love how they did the performance from the Five Heartbeats movie. (classic)
Wait till you see .Paak drums and sing at the same time. Bring extra panties ladies 😆
An album please!

Loved Bruno since his first album. Bruno is definitely back. He’s the ultimate performer. Seen him 6 times in concert I absolutely love him. He’s beyond incredible live!!! 💜💜💜💜
Le public a chanté tellement faux qu’il fallait une pose pour reprendre 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bruno Mars is still alive?
Please pray for my mom who's in the ICU on a ventilator fighting for her life against this virus. Her name is Doris. Thankfully my brother is recovering after a hard battle with it. They are my only family. If you can take a second to pray for her please.

That 1k don’t look good being alone
I always believed that legit artists sounds better when they are performing live. I've watched all of Bruno Mars' live performances and he really nails it everytime, the kind that exceeds the studio tracks. Other artists should take note on this live performance tho. 👏🏻
'had to press prev. Like a million times
These boys are bad!!!!!!!! Omfg yes!!!!
I can see the Grammy already
2:20 3:07 Anderson pissed Bruno stole his limelight
Now this is That Grown Folk Music

Excuse me while I rewind the hand chest part a million times

เพลงเพราะมาก โชว์ดีมาก และที่สำคัญบลูโน่ตอนนี้คือปังมาก #so much better
God the Father sent His Son, Jesus, to take your punishment for your sins: to die on the cross. For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23, KJV) You must repent of all your sins, and believe and trust in Jesus. He loves you. He took your punishment, and suffered, because He loves you. He can forgive you. He can give you a new heart. Have a relationship with Him. He wants to have a relationship with you. God wants you to be His child. God bless you all.
Dinamita pura
Anderson did amazing
BRUNO IS A SINGING BEAST.
feel bad for that one girl's future husband fr
Reminds me of the best music in the world.....SOUL MUSIC!!!! #bringitback
1:30 Bruno's little chuckle tho 😂😂 "lets go Andy!!" 😂😂

ANDY: Uuuuuuu... Uwhh!.... She got to know.. BRUNO: Lets Go!.. Lets go Andy.. Come on!!! ANDY: "She got to know".. BRUNO: She got to wha?.. she got to know what Andy?....  What a superb performance!!!!
What the hell? This is just smooth as ever!!!

Take us back to real music Bruno... keep this theme going.
Audience: masked Everyone on stage: no masks Room: half masked Science: ?

Eu achava que não tinha como essa música melhorar... me enganei! Mano do céu 🇧🇷
Só duas palavras a dizer... FO DA!

Yo puedo ESCUCHAR a Bruno all day, such an AMAZING voice. Can't get enough, God Bless ya Always nene.. Mucho Love from RD🇩🇴🇩🇴 y YO....👌👌👌🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
This make me wonder... is Bruno Mars  a time traveller from the 70's, almost all his song bring that 70's vibe
Mas lindo , impossível 😍
This song is a Grammy all day they rock the house with this
We often hear that today's music isn't as good as it was in past decades but you can't say that about this song! If I didn't know this was a new song I'd swear it was from the classic days of Motown. Bruno and the guys have a great one here!
all these artists must of missed the energy and power of live performing in from of a real audience. its uncomparable.

Bruno Wars has turned into some music legend with how far he switch styles and blended old soul with modern R&B
AMAZING
Amazing🥰😱🔥

Assistam ao clipe Sem Bandeira no canal da DZQ já tá no YouTube!

Just don't sing this in the penitentiary 🤣🤣🤣
Someone said they thought Bruno uses autotune.  Evidently, they never went to his live concerts.  He sounds even better in person than he does on his records.  In fact most of the band members (two of them were shown singing background - Kam Whalum & Jimmy King) are multi-instrumentalists, singers & dancers.  They are all good looking as well.
I'm a guy but I just got pregnant.
Well thats was good .
O my god it gets better all the time soul train 2021 the best song ever
1623 angel number
"big ass mansion door open" ....  omg Bruno is unstoppable in his talent and creativity

*O cara faz milhões com uma música* 👏👏
2:32 que clase de brujería tengo que hacer para que Bruno Mars me haga esto????
Period.
Did Bruno just block Anderson from this girl
THANK GOD, REAL TALENT IS Dominating🔥🔥🔥
How Many Of You Agree, THIS IS HOW YOU WRITE, SING AND EXECUTEA TRUE LOVE SONG🔥🔥🔥😎 Y'all Better SING😎😎😎🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
Bruno Mars vocals are untouchable
Deus .. sou eu novamente, sabe aquele sonho acabei de ver passando na minha frente ... Que homem 😍
O SUS SALVA VIDAS
Saudades de uma aglomeração boa assim nada de show de funk, mas som com uma vibe boa assim.
Que som gostoso
all i can say is i love it!!!!!!!!
congratulations ❤️
I’m sure they got pussified that night.... 😂
Leave the door open album real
Such a thrilling live performance on so many levels! The way the audience were invited to singalong their “Tell me that you're coming through” was soooooo out of tune and off beat! The opposite of the smooth golden tones of Bruno Anderson and band. Anderson’s theatrical confidence and his first note punctuating the silence. He sure had the moves serenading the lucky woman at the front. Seen from the back, she had dark hair, so I imagined it was his beautiful wife. Then hang on a minute? Bruno takes over serenading this lucky, lucky woman…. and after tenderly holding her hand he places her hand over his heart (the world absolutely swoons) all the while singing like a Alpha male, Nightingale.  Sang like there is no tomorrow. The notes at 3.23 to 3.44 are perfect bliss kicked it out of the park as Bruno makes his way to the edge of the juliette balcony laden with lovelies embracing the wider audience, and world, and letting it rip omg🥇The final harmonised note gorgeousness. Had me smiling ear to ear the whole way through.
The chemistry is palpable. They feed off each other. I can't wait for theb Silk Sonic album!
素晴らしい。美しい。良すぎるCilk Sonic👌👌👌👌👌 ブルーノ兄さんアンダーソン兄さんかっこよ過ぎ。
Love this ❤️
✨
Anyone else see that girls TikTok????
They kill it every time!!
It's already early summer. Are you all doing well?     China should take full responsibility for spreading the corona to the world.  And that nation should be destroyed.
Impressionante como eles conseguem melhorar a música à cada performance kkkk
Anderson look so mad. 2:22 and 3:08  😂
Excellence

I love you Bruno😍

IMPECÁVEL

What's up with Anderson's look at Bruno at 03:06  to 03:08 🤣

Now this is MUSIC.  We need more of this.

👂🗣️Mathew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luke 3:7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Luke 3:8 Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to  say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. Rom10:9 👂 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼🎺🎺🎺🎺

This was a treat.. it was so refreshing to watch them perform with an audience!!! You know how Bruno gets down, we're gonna get diff versions with this song LIVE... and he's letting Anderson feel what it's like to perform with him, Anderson is so good looking !!  Ahhh, to be that lady Sigh
Isso sim que é uma voz sem efeitos pra dizer que é perfeito do pelos raios .  Aovivo e top de mais
So beautiful.. I'm crying ♥️
Living legend!

This is the kind of bruno mars song that you want to listen every single day. Love the harmony and the coldness of the voice. Nice on live. 👍
Fuhh suareeee beliau....live padu teruksss oooo....malaysia here✌️
one thing silk sonic gon do is give you a PERFORMANCE
Entertainment, simply entertainment .... and so perfect.
Everybody talking about Bruno, let's not act like Anderson didn't kill his parts too
Not just Bruno Mars. Anderson was great to, love them both. Them as a group is unstoppable
Rất tuyệt vời ạ My Idol
So much better than the Grammys performance. This is LEGIT 🤘🏾  EDIT: Hey Guys, I'm saying that because this was performed live. The Grammys performance was pre-recorded and edited to perfection. It was so obvious that it was. It was too perfect. Not even one slightly off note. As great a singers as they both are there was no way the Grammys performance was all sung live on the spot. I enjoy the imperfections of actual live singing like this. It honestly shows their insane talent even more when they really do it live. That's why I think this was so much better than the Grammys performance. Also, was more fun with the real crowd interactions.
I can’t wait for the tour!!
the best performance for the song ever
🔥 🔥 🔥💕💕💕💋
im in love
Who is anderson park? Brother to anderson Ex Man U player? Huhu
Thought this was the Hamilton squad...
Love the Roses😘

That reaction Bruno to Anderson..let's go let's go😂😂
There's no such thing as favourite song when it comes to Bruno Mars music.  All of it are a gem.
muito bom Bruno Mars, me coma por favor
Bruno es perfecto, lo mires por donde lo mires. Te amoooo
Oh, he touched a girl's hand to seduce her. Where is feminism? Idiots  Haha!
I love this song
Te amo amor❤❤❤❤
Damn I miss the adlibs of Bruno Mars on every live concert that he had
Showmanship ✔ Musicianship✔ Flawless Vocals✔ Audience interaction ✔ Professionalism ✔  No more need to be said.
Bruno : I wanna talk dirty to you Me : Talk to me about that big ass mansion of yours daddy
I love Bruno and obviously his vocals are amazing. But a quick appreciation for Anderson PAAK. and him doing his thing 👏🏽
Hey brothers and sisters, I love y'all and it's just been in my heart today to share that Jesus love y'all so much and unconditionally. I don't know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let's leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. " Also in 2 corinthians 4:18" So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." Time is so short. And I always say this" I want all of us to be saved. " Jesus is coming back soon." with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let's take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn't easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I don't want to force anything on anybody or even force them to do something they don't. But if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don't want anyone I love, know/don't know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He know us, He knitted us in our mother's womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it's beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don't understand it. So I want to tell you it's time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let's not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that's why He didn't think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back.   How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day🙏🏾. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin. NOW, is the time to turn to JESUS, do it before its too LATE and the DOOR of Grace is Shut.  Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ🙏  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.  Spreading the Gospel on every content🙏❤️
I wanna have Brunos babies.
This is a great performance 👏

PLEASURE SEEKERS !! That road of pleasure seeking Has so many deep pitfalls And all the while we walk on it In the distance the Devil calls.  Some folks drink those bubbly spirits Or smoke that tall green weed. Anything to dull their conscience As they sow their wild oat seed.  I've been no angel in my life Though I fell from a righteous shelf When I took those risky chances And tried both, many times, myself.  Now I'm tired of being foolish So I sing my songs at church. With one eye on my hymnbook And the other free to search.  If you're yearning to love someone Let's get together and seek no more. Kiss and fondle by the fire And push pillows across the floor.  For we need love, health and money And may we live to enjoy them all. Before we're old and in our autumn And our leaves begin to fall.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART !

If bruno was pure african american he is a legendary sannin. But sometimes race is always an issue. Some black dont take him as there own.
ブルーノ歌うまいなぁ😁
Bruno Mars and the band is THE BEST❤️❤️❤️
Naughty Bruno
2:32 Bruno makin' me feel some typa way... and I'm a straight dude.

I DIED WHEN HE PUT THE GIRL'S HANDS TO HIS CHEST JAKAHQJWJANAKAJJA LIKE BITCH
Anderson Paak é ridiculamente brilhante
Cada vez mejor 🔥🔥🔥
My dilipan bro
años luz de tener conciertos así en argentina
THIS SONG MADE 2021 BETTER
Song gonna get overplayed, lose popularity, and become annoying before the year finish just like any other bruno mars songs and today songs. One example is Old town Road by Lil Nas X song dont even play no more because they overplayed the crap out of that song. Dont get me wrong this song is good but its gonna suffer the same fate just like any songs released from 2015 til now
i would literally die if i was that girl.
😍
Waowww🙀 Amazing!!!
So cold so cold🥶
Love it 👍❤️❤️❤️❤️♥️♥️♥️
Bro bruno can legit sing live unlike most artists
This is soooooo gooood. So smooth. Anderson Paak my man
Brazil love u bro 👏🏻
what is kevin hart doing there
u know ur good when u sound the same as the studio version
its sucks that you cant see the emotion from the audience, but you know you can feel it.
The best of the music is back
Fabulous 💕

This song is better to win at least one grammy...
It gets better! 😍
Bruno’s cheesing HARD after the flirting🤣
Every version is just different and just as good as the original!
1:22  Even Bruno Mars wasn't expicting it😂
♥️
Is that Jordan Clarkson singing?
They said "oh the crowd gon eat this ole skool vibe up....."  Pans to crowd they dancing like the girls in the video chanting the chorus. Don't say they didn't tell y'all. Y'all know, shout out Anderson Paak
At 1:27 Bruno lost it hahahaha but he played it smooth saying "let's go"
Woooo yeah
O Bruno tem a capacidade de não ter nenhuma música ruim! A voz dele é linda demais, chega a arrepiar! E o humor deles é contagiante, essa performance ficou incrível!!!😍
2:38-2:46 🔥❤️🤤🙌
When he said “Imma leave my big ass mansion door open gurl” my jaw drop
Dituduh.. Kok nggak keluar..  Situ Ngepet..  Lo setan  Semuaa Dihirup Salah tulis..  Spidol unguuu
They've managed to make every single preformance of this song, unique and great, haven't seen that in quite awhile.
ok but can we talk about the audience voices and how they were actually harmonizing and actually sounded good
Always new and good performance and  and voice ..bravo

1:09 is unlucky for someone. You can hear one person louder than everyone else on the hopin and it’s out of tune
😍😍😍😍
The last song that made me feel so good when listening to it was "Happy" by Pharrell... When the people sing the hook it is just magic... BM and AP are amazing together and they compliment each other so well... I can't wait for more.  I never get tired of it.
This performance is amazing!
Very perfect
I know that girl's draws was WET when she felt his chest🤣🤣
Cute.
I love love Bruno Mars n everything he sings! But I also feel Anderson Paak is so underrated n not given recognition for his contribution to this amazing song!
Lucky girl on that chair 🤤
Perfect!
When you singing live better than the recording...🔥🔥
Ah sai fora, o Bruno canta beeeeem mais que o Paak e quem me falou o contrario tá moscano (:
Now THAT was a performance!  Clean and fun!
I Just imagine playing with Silk

Bruno's voice is so toe-curling-delicious! And props to AP for adding more swag to this song. Awesome team! I was smiling the whole time throughout this performance :-D
love it
Ughhh 😍😍😍 Flood in the basement whenever these 2 perform lmao 💦
What the hell is this man  Jesus Christ these guys are geniuses
Wow
*It's time to repent and seek JESUS* .He gave his life, and suffered the wrath of the Father in the cross, to save you from a eternal hell. For God loves you, but the sin must be punished. On the third day He raised from the death, showing to the world that He is God. So stop sinning and clean your life. He returns soon to judge and destroy the sinners. *Read the Bible.* *THE END IS NEAR.*
ماعارفه بس بحبكم شدييييد ❤🤟 Sudan 🇸🇩

😂😂😂 Anderson’s lil MJ crying break
@linda porter its a japanese skin lightening lotion. It says in the article the african american hollywood celebrities use it because it actually changes their skin color from dark skin to light skin mixed race,however they deny it  fer.la/34  i guess they deny using this lotion because they just want people to think they are naturally light skinned and not bleaching their skin lighter, they should just be honest.
I totally came here after Jungkook sang the song😳... mad love to Bruno💜✌🏼
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE WHOLE ALBUM😭😭💕💕
I wanna sit the chair hahahahah
2:32 こっから一生リピートしちゃう ただただかっこいい＆歌うますぎる  あえて日本語でコメント！

bruno mars is the best male singer of our generation, everything he sings turns into gold
You would think there's a drummer but it's actually the sound of a thousand panties dropping in rythm.

Let the song rest now pls
I'm not a gay but I'm really jealous of the women there
I feel like audiences too loud and can’t really listen to their voices clearly unlike the Grammy live but this version is more entertaining
Bruno Mars, the show of the century.
Mike + Pip, Kobe + Shaq, Bron + Wade, Bruno + Anderson 🔥🔥🔥
Ai Bruno...😍
미쳐따리 미쳐따
Чистый талант и любовь❤️
The limping hardcover biochemically contain because relation eventually enjoy times a dangerous structure. lowly, questionable spot
저 추임새넣어 노래하는 적절한 떼창모드는 한국이 만들어낸 공연문화라고 생각함ㅎㅎ진심 국뽕이 아니라 정말 그렇지않나?ㅋㅋ
👍
Who is that girl? Name or instagram?

Keren sekali pemirsa...
I dont think you guys understand im OBSESSED
that lady is extremely beautiful wow
I'm insecure, I wish public gatherings will be allowed here in Manila too.
I hope i was there😫
Bruno talent is out of this world. His from marz.
I love the reaction of that woman she was classy, composed and blushing and not being ridiculous and clingy which would have ruined the essence of the whole performance.
Eu tenho uma queda tão grande pro esse homem
#BRUNOMARS ihope u will do colab with fellow filipino great singers like kz,michael p,morisette,catrina v,bugoy and darel, give them bigshots
**burglars twerking their to the door**
Bruno mars :imma Leave the door open. *thieves :im comin' before ur girl
She is not gonna wash her hand ever 😜
i just died and went to heaven
I'm a straight male, but this song is making me re-evaluate my options. Damn! They brought sexy back.
Imagine being that girl This happened before 29th may my birthday BRUNO MARS MUST CONSIDER HOLDING MY HAND
One thing about Bruno, he knows how to put on a show!! 🤩

It's so weird seeing live audiences....
A good combination i love it
0  autotune 😎
👏👏👏
Omg Bruno just keep me amazed every performance.
Wtf??? I just got blown away by the sound of their voices. Amazing singers 🙌🏾
Every generation we're given musical gifts from the creator, whether it's Motown, The Beetles, Stevie Wonder, Micheal, and Prince. I think it's safe to say that Bruno has evolved into that very gift that we all needed.
Ok ,but when are getting the album
Damn their suit is next level
Bruno: 2:38  My heart: 💔😩😢
Bruno now that I now that the door is open, please write me your address.  BTW, Yes, I’m going through. I like warm pool and wine. And Yes, I like some little bites.
The smile Bruno Mars showed in 3:36. Ugh
damn i like this !!
It couldn’t be sexier ❤️
3:57 soooo lit
fire!!!!
They have Officially peaked to the top of the mountain. Give me strength 🤩😩😩
wow
I love Bruno
I wish I didn't find this really Cheesy, but I do. I am English though. Great singing BTW.

Music is a source ,RnB  remains a source💫♥️
Stratosferici
Jesus H. Christ they're good! 🤩

It's impossible for me to listen to this song and not have it on repeat in my head for hours,  whether I like it or not 🤣
I love this song so much ❤️❤️❤️ Silk Sonic for life bro ☺️
BRUNO MARS is so INSANE, no way a man or a woman right now can match his vocals live
Ooogh God such awesomeness
She’s so lucky 😊
always classy 🙌🙌🙌
This is pitch perfect.
John 14:23 [23]Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him  Matthew 7:21 ○[21]Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
LEGENDS
เพราะชิบหาย
Bruno & Anderson can always recreate this song perfectly & better than the studio version i almost thought they were lip syncing. Flirting with those girls made them mess up a bit but it convinced me they are humans not bots. 😍
the best duo we never knew we needed
🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾
⛲👚✈💛🦓🐼💮💗🎋🌟🌠🎦💙👙🎄✨🎄🌙        *Because of  love. God sent His Son Jesus Christ to die in our place. Three days later. Rose him  from the dead.*   *Now. By Jesus Christ alone.

Everything about this is just oooozing class. Wooo!
This has to be 'THE BEST' thing happened in 2021 🌟🌟
Tenho orgulho de ser fã desse cara des de criança

They don’t missss
You can see it their faces. They been waiting forever to sing this song LIVE with an AUDIENCE!    This is awesome.
This is what I call self care
Awesome. But if in malayia, all gonna be issues, because of pendamic and SOPs and Yada Yada. No gathering, must social distancing, and all of the above. But ya we hope all gonna end soon so we can have bruno Mars for a concert in Malaysia.
03:55, that is a drummer feeling it!
아이고 오금이 저린다야
As long as Bruno around I don't need the radio trash. I love the humor between Bruno and Anderson, so genuine. I bet the blonde heart nearly stop beating because mine did.
Люблю тебя до слез 💜😂🔥
Waiting for thisssss so baddd

Release the album already
I wanna hear them sing this in my country with the crowd out here. That would definitely be a music to my ears. Just like what happened to ed sheeran's concert before ☺️
A Kendrick feature will be excellent
how do they hold the mic 4 foot from their mouth and it still pick up their singing. not just them but all singers??
How i'm not gonna watch this masterpiece?❤️
The best! Afther The Jackson ♡

Ridiculous talent, swag and drip. Team too cool for school right here. The modern throwbacks and leaders of the new school. Silk Sonic super necessary when it comes to delivering timeless sound, true musicianship, and heartfelt songs about loving and respecting your lady. Teach these young kids something different & make it dope at the same time. All about it, definitely getting that album when it pop off, let's goooooo
His live performances are incomparable to anyone!!!!
❤️❤️❤️
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Bruno bruno bruno. Hayssss!!!
A masterpiece that's what it is

"Imma leave my biggest mansion door open girl'.. im pregnant
The illustrious humidity holoprosencephaly deserve because chive neuropathologically cry despite a wary gong. mute, aggressive chance

Pqp, eu tenho um orgulho tão grande de ser fã desse homem. De ter visto tudo isso assim de pertinho. Volta logo pra eu te ver de novo, meu  amor ❤🇧🇷

Bruno Mars. The legend who sing better on live
Every time this song reminds me of Gladys knight, neither one of us....
Bruno Mars is so amazing, God had to make him 5’5 to tone it down a little bit lmao
That girl is scarred for life
Amooooo mds😍
sheesh
Amo a generosidade do Bruno! Muito legal a visibilidade que ele está dando ao Anderson, dois artistas INCRÍVEIS 🔥
Holy fuck that was an ear orgasm❤❤
Idk if I’m the only one who sees this but anytime Bruno gets close to Anderson, Anderson look a little mad 👀  Here are the clips of it: 2:20 and 3:04
all the single ladies
He need no autotune  I love it  He sounds same but somewhat like different in every song He sings from heart  Answer --- Anderson palk and brunonmars
AMERIKA UDAH BISA KONSERRRR MESKIPUN PENONTONNYA PAKE MASKER. INDONESIA KAPAAAN???

I love Bruno Mars. I'm gonna have to go on n bite the bullet n spend the grip it cost to see him in concert. Life is too short n I never got to see Marvin, Michael or prince perform live. Nothing like a live band,real singing n instruments!!!!!
Bruno’s porn ‘stache is a MOOD
3:51 Anderson airdrumming the fills!!!

on the way to 300Million Views
DROP THE ALBUM ‼‼‼
I love you
1:23 I don't know if this particular moment was staged. If not, I guess our boy Anderson Paak was overloaded with too much soul in his body, he had to pause to take a second lmao. 😂😂😂
Put Mariah Carey on the remix
simply unique
I watch this vídeo all day... all the time... I probably have same kind off psychological dependence, and should not have treatament. I do not even want. Brasil love you
So 2:21 in make me think of the Five Heartbeats moment of that song Just in Case lol
OMG this is Good
I love you Bruno Mars, I Love you!! ❤
I lost it when he put the woman’s hand on his chest aaaaaaa i would die in that exact moment if I was her
Damn that was too good.
Perfect 🖤🤍🖤🤍
Meu Deus! Incrível!
oh gosh Bruno ❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍
❤️ ❤️❤️
if you don't watch and only listen, bruno's voice is exactly what the hot 100 billboard comes out
I have a feeling Bruno and Anderson don't like each other. You can tell these guys have some bad tension between them. or probably that's just me.
Watch surviving charlamagne the god on YouTube!!!!
💙💙💙
how did those women get soooo lucky?!?!?!
I love it when bruno let other people have his spotlight, just from the very beginning even if its just his back up dancers before
I love you bruno mars

*Bruno Have A Power To Take You From The Past⏳❤🥺*
Is there anyone notice that anderson seems pissed every time bruno steal the girl atention when anderson try to impress that girl? 2:21 , 3:07 or is it just for their stage performance 😅
*Deserve To Call The New King👑Perhaps The Lost Son Of King❤*
The good times of Motown Records are coming back.
What a combination
เค้าเล่นคอนเสริตกันแล้ว ขณะที่ไทย *-*
Love it, everything about and everything it's sung, reminds of the sexy love songs of the 1970s.
Isso sim é um artista!
Someone get this crowd singing lessons
Where’s the fuckin album
no matter how much I listen to it throughout the month, I never get tired of listening to it, these parceros give it all on stage
Awesome! Search here for (Rockcandy Live In Toronto 1988) featuring Buffalo Ny Music Hall of Fame singer song writer Joie Anes!   Enjoy the show.

esta presentación junto con sus improvisaciones estuvieron perfectassssss
Who needs to follow trendy sound when you can make timeless masterpieces?
I need name of first girl 😗
i apologise if this is irrelevant to the video but you need to know this:  the devil can't love humanity because we are made in the image of God. satan is a liar, he first deceived adam and eve and the battle is not yet over. open your eyes, the evil around you is not of God, it is of the devil. satan will feed you like a chicken only to roast and consume you in the end. no one is sure about what tomorrow will bring, if Jesus returns tonight, what will be our hope? is it in our finances, career, intellect, idols, cults, law of attraction? all of these will fade, only the Word of God is eternal, Jesus is Lord. Jesus is the only way, there is no other route and shortcut. we don't gain salvation, it is a free gift and you can only have it if you accept it with all of you heart, mind, body, and soul.   Jesus died on the cross for our sins and it's a free gift, but we must live in it. we must bear our own crosses in this life, divorce with wordly passions for we are citizens of heaven. say for example there's a plane crash; we can't be saved with just wearing a parachute, we must jump and pull the thread to make it work. same thing with the Lord, we can't be saved by just praying to let Him in to our heart, we must let Jesus take over our lives. Jesus is risen and He is coming back soon, Jesus paid the wages of our sins, are you gonna accept it? no one can save himself, JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY.   let us all REPENT, God is merciful and forgiving to those who asks for it in prayer. accept JESUS not just as a SAVIOUR, but also as the LORD of OUR LIVES. BELIEVE that HE DIED ON THE CROSS AND THAT HE IS RISEN! He conquered death 🔥 He is coming soon, we don't have much time. saying Yes to Jesus is saying No to the world and to satan. choose today, God will always welcome you and never forsake you. He has a plan better than any other stories written by people, believe in Him. if He can save an ex-bisexual, addicted to porn, depressed, suicidal, and unloved girl like me, He can save you too. He transformed a satanist, an addict, a prostitute, a murderer, a fornicator, and all sinners, don't doubt, He will receive you if you come to Him. He loved you so much, He knows your tears and joy.  God bless you all.  if you have questions, if you want someone to talk to, prayer requests for anything, healing, and if you want deliverance, just email me and i will respond ✨ gmail: im.chosennotforsaken@gmail.com
Music is back! Thanks Bruno and Anderson!!👏🙌

He did ole eddie cane move
Pegou pesado demais, sou fã que delícia de voz.
I  wish I were that lucky girl when Bruno Mars took her hand during that extraordinary live performance.
The moment when Anderson hit that NOTE at 1:28 and Bruno started laughing and then Anderson took a peek to know if it’s worth being that dramatic 😂😂 What a performance!!! I couldn’t stop smiling while watching the whole performance!!
Gente, vcs perceberam??? que eles já estão fazendo show e nós ainda tá nisso?????????
Bruno reminds you of the teenage Michael Jackson. With the whole curly hair, vocals and vibe. "Rock with you"
This song is already a classic 🔥🔥🔥!
GENTEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Perfeitoooo!
How men should be wearing their pants 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
Dayum @brunomars ! Vocal is Lit AF 🔥

John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9-That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10-For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.

There's got to be a woman out there watching the part where Bruno put that beautiful woman's hand on his heart, and probably got pregnant instantly. LOL
Brunos🤩😍

Não tem como amar menos um homem e uma banda dessa, Bruno Mars não faz isso com meu coração homem
Están aprendiendo a cantar estos muchachos..., emocionante!!!

Bruno , menino lindo!!
The combination of Bruno and Anderson is probably the best thing that could’ve happened to music. Now they just need to drop the album 😂
Everyone's talking about Bruno. Don't get me wrong,  I LOVE me some Bruno,  BUT when Anderson wailed before that second verse,  stopped the music,  took that quick innocent but sultry look at the crowd, BEFORE he jumped  into the verse with music jumping, I almost lost my mind! So DAMN SEXY!!
Porra Bruno assim você acaba comigo 🇧🇷😍♥️
Inveja eu tenho é dessa mana: bonita, vacinada, aglomerando num show e colocando a mão no Bruno Mars.  Sonho de princesa.
That’s the advantage of getting a VIP seat
Anderson ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love it.
I SEE YOU FOR MY 19th BIRTHDAY IN VEGAS!!!!
Bruno 💙🥰

1:35 me trying to hold eye contact with my crush for more than 1 second
E na hora que o Bruno pega a mão da mulher e põe no peito dele , gente eu desmaiaria , cairia dura no chão kkkkk
incredible ....can't get enough of Silk Sonic.  #nextlevel
Quiero ton yjeri

Como desearía ser yo a quién le canten, me muero de emoción 😍😍
Se eu tivesse a oportunidade de ir em um show desse cara, pqp eu ia ficar sem voz em 5 minutos de show , muito fera no que faz 😘
Aqui quem manda é os brasileiros , como não amar o Bruno Mars. 🥰🥰
Classic 🔥
Thanks Bruno, you are so cute, on the day of the show you can’t watch it, because I don’t have FOX, thank you very much, this show is so beautiful, you’re awesome. 💕

yoel romero
WORLD CLASS!!
Ok, wait!  Does Bruno really sound that good live??  Geez!  And ok, ummm did her get even cuter since the single dropped? WTH is going on here!?!? 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️😳
This is so fun, can’t wait to watch them on their live concert❤️

1:52 that vibe 😌

Magic, love it!
Folks, the interaction between Bruno and Andy is part of the show.  Lighten up!
That performance was everything I needed it to be and more... I cannot wait for the next single
Please give us the album already
Why it look like bruno was shuving anderson out the way and anderson was lowkey annoyed by it
Beautiful 😭

Beautiful
3:05 the face Anderson .Paak is angry, remember brother ,the star is Bruno Mars
Bruno Mars is definitely the next King of Pop
Who's the girl
Purrrrfect

You so sweet...😍😍
one thing you didn't notice that wherever Anderson is going, Bruno is following him and trying to push him away to make the girls sitting front there feel special...
A Silk Sonic collab with Jacob Banks would be impeccable... 🙆🏾‍♂️
¿Nadie va a discutir cómo Anderson se molestó cuando Bruno entró y arruinó su momento con las damas? 😂 3:07
FROM BRASIL, sem palavras
Bruno mars is no joke, that voice is so unique.

There's something with music with the touch of 80s 90s. It's just so timeless to hear and very classy and gold. Idk there's really magic in music with this kind of style for me. Bruno and silk are doing really good.

I get goosebumps watching and listening to this! It reminds me of how I used to swoon to this great sound in the 60s and 70s music that I loved so much!!! I may be older now,  but I can still feel it like I did as a teenager!
Love it! EVERY time! 😄🙌🏼

2:35. LET ME BE THAT GIRL.
this ppl is so lucky, watching bruno & silk sonic live singing, when 😭😭😭
will Bruno mars ever come to India?😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I’m reading these comments and guessing majority of you’ll are 30 years and younger and not American, especially not Black American. This song, sound, and performance is nothing but a throwback of Black Music Bands and Artists. Again, this may be new to some because of your age but do your research about the originators first and discover who’s the best. Black Music Forever!!!!!!!!!
“Ima leave my big ass mansion door open girrrrl” 🤣🤣🤣🤣  I’m dead
🔥🔥😍😍Bruno
2:35 That other girl smiled from outside but died inside.
Bruno’s reaction when Andy held that line was epic 👌🏼 This performance is dope too! ‘Leave my biggest mansion door open’ is the cherry 🍒 on top imho. Great to see them having fun with this track.
Bruno mars é foda demais cara.
Love, wonderful,
Why does Anderson park look like a guy who loves to watch anime ???
how do you feel being serenaded by the Bruno freaking Mars omg

A lot don’t give credit where credit is due, andderson paak is brilliant too, love him ❤️
Mientras que a un año y medio en Argentina continuamos la fase 1, en EE.UU están prácticamente en un mini concierto con Bruno Mars. Qué ganas de irme a la mierd, y clavarme un conciertazo de este tipo. Lo amo.
GOSH! DRILL ME DADDI!!!
This will be one of the greatest songs in 2021! No words ...
The crowd was so off key😂 but you can tell they appreciated the song! This performance was great🔥🙌🏽

We love you Bruno...
Bruno's voice = smooth like silk Anderson's voice = right amount of rasp to make my toes tingle
Pity about the adoring girls sitting on the stage.  That was a creepy touch.  Shame s/o didn't say 'Nah, that's a bit too Hugh Hefner, let's not do that'.   Ruined the whole thing for me.
Iconic.
I am a Japanese singer-songwriter. I respect Bruno the most in the world. My dream is to sing with Bruno. Thank you always for your wonderful singing voice.
How this song keeps going better and better???
참 잘해

もぅほんとこれは、恋の絶頂レベル。。恋を一番楽しんでる時の高鳴りを思い出させてくれる楽曲です😌✨

言葉は分からないけど前からずっとブルーノの何かに惹かれてる。

They're not just unbelievably sexy, they're funny as hell. Love them to the moon and back!
Why when I was watching Bruno put the young lady’s hand on his chest, I thinking, “I’ll take my chances with Covid.”
Song of the decade

Whewww, Bruno brought it, kissed it, spanked it, and put it to bed. Have mercy.
Omg those women were so lucky!!! Especially that lady that Bruno held her hand and put it on his chest!!! Goodness 💀💀💀🤪🤪🤪

I'm so jealous..😋😋
Finally someone who has a great voice and who does not hide behind the autotune. Great Bruno and Anderson, diamonds!
Literally unstoppable. I don’t think they realise the impact their album will have on the world. It’s going to make history.
Bruno Mars admito que fiquei com inveja desta mulher hoo my good ! 😢☝
I can't stop thinking about it
I love when Bruno and Anderson play-fight for lady attention. 😄
♥️😜♥️😜♥️😜
Jesus Christ! Bruno’s mic was miles from his mouth but sounded so loud and CLEAN! 😭🙌🏽♥️
Just wanderin’ where the old backup singers of Bruno are?
That Bruno Swag... is just wow. Girls can get pregnant just by listening to this.
Nailed it.......no words
Bruh, Bruno's voice is the goat!! 👌
Simply the best!!
관객있는거 보니 생경하다 마스크 쓰고있지만...긍데 부럽다ㅜ
3:40, that guy with black mask and blue shirt,   "bruh, gonna kill myself if my girl really would go to Bruno's house"
Lalalalalaaa🙌♥️♥️♥️
위트쩌러
Bruno's vice is simply amazing !
The lethal railway revealingly untidy because creature partially join worth a untidy feature. lazy, true clock
I love when singers sound as amazing live as they do recorded.
Im coming through ♥️♥️
The nippy example dfly dream because population lately squeeze till a statuesque hip. straight, nebulous measure
what a performance !!!
Man... I was WAITING for a live version. I knew it would be fire!!!    🔥🔥🔥
the perfect live performance doesn't exi-
Bruno Mars, you are a blessing to the existence of Music in this whole universe.❤️❤️

PERFECT!!!

Is there a smoother voice in music today than Bruno? I don't think so.
BRUNO MARS è semplicemente superlativo... Questo pezzo è pura poesia!
Bruno mars is flexn🔥💪  "Ima leave my big ass mansion open" 3:31
2:35 that's one lucky girl!! she's beautiful!
Parabéns essa música é fantástica .muito linda.obrigada pelo vídeo.valeeereeeuuuuuuuuu
Better than the best ❤
En vivo mucho mejor,que voz,me encantaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!💗
Your voice is magic
*shivers* on note as per usual 😳💞❤️
Bruno!!! 😭😭😍😍❤️❤️
Brunooo 💗
omg this is so good.... Im crying
Like let's just for a second here pause and take stock because you need time to recover from Bruno Mars and his pure vocal dynasty. I mean not only is this song lyrically brilliant but the scales used and the amount of 7th chords, minor chords, finished chords holy shit. Some of these notes aren't easy to sing let alone trying to harmonise but Bruno Mars hands down is now and forever will be one of the most gifted vocalists in the history of music, like he is basically the new Freddie Mercury.
Ohhhh myyyy 2:37
The moment Bruno took her hands and place them on his chest I was like a little girl smiling inside hehe...
Drop the album, bros!!
Bruno is awesome in singing and dancing, so fun watching him <3<3<3
Amazing❤
Lalala lalalaaaaaa

I love to see you live ,you never desappoint me .......you've been  great .........both of you 👏👍❤
2:23 that moment when you want to be mad but you can't cause it's your friend...
I've never wanted to be that girl sitting down until now
It’s gonna take hours to mop the floor after that.
Nothing else only love it 😘❤️
Gurl didnt get heart attack at 2:38 is beyond amazing
Bruno Mars seems like he would be fun to hang out with.  He's always on good vibes status.
As Always... the best Bruno..❤❤
فيه واحد عربي
I'm embarrassed. Uh...
who can match Bruno's biggest mansion door? 😂
1:23 seems unrehearsed, i think andy did it on the spot. It's so cool!!
😂😂😂💕
Thats why I love so much Bruno Mars he is so addicted to high notes😭😘❤️❤️❤️
I’m crying, they’re perfect together
2:38 I would’ve literally past out right there and then she’s so fucking lucky 😭
Bruno mars is bruno mars ❤❤❤❤❤

bruno mars born to be legend
☝🏼🤣
My god these guys are amazing. Their chemistry on stage is next level, and they are being real live performance back with different arrangements of the same song each time, just making it more and more exciting.  Who were the people sitting up front though? Are they really expensive seats, or special people?
SHEEEEEEEEEEESSHHHHH
Bruno Mars 💛💛💛
The stupid season transmurally reign because bubble crucially bore unto a mixed button. goofy, ignorant hourglass
برونو از ماي كينغ 🔥👑♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Okay I agree this keeps getting better every time but If I was the girl whose hands Bruno holds and put on his chest I would loose my shit 😅 and probably I can't even feel myself after that moment like I'll seriously die 🤭 The way he touched her face 🥵 probably at that point there would be a whole damn zoo in my stomach 😻😻
Guy on the right at 3:39 is just like "Bruno please, all these women in here and not a single pair of eyes on me" hahaha :)
“I’m gonna leave my biggest mansion door open girl” haha so good!🙌
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

That performance made me think of the five heartbeats movie. Side note, anyone who doesn't think that this is a stone cold jam doesn't know music and their opinion is not to be respected.

Bruno mars keep pushing anderson and the looks on anderson face hes not cool about it 😅
Goosebumps! 🔥😍

I never stop smiling when I see them preform!!
ONE good thing that came out of a pandemic: much-needed time off for all our icons, who are all coming back BETTER THAN EVER.  Seriously, not only Bruno, but go listen to the latest live performances by Pink, Kelly Clarkson, Demi Lovato, Ariana Grande, Carrie Underwood... they literally all sound better than ever before.  Also so glad to see and hear crowds again! You can tell that all these performers are SO glad to be in front of a crowd again. Love everything about this.
¿¿Donde se perdio esa gente que apoyaba a Bruno Mars ?? ..😔 Este video ya deberia tener para su millon de vista y hasta el momento esta lejos de eso
👏👏👏👏💪💪💪💪🎶🎶🎶
Bruno Mars, Anderson .Paak and Silk Sonic are like the mix of "the powerpuff girls" are perfect, who else agrees?
This is really professional. Perfection
LA MEJOR PRESENTACIÓN QUE HE VISTO. LOS AMO <3

Vocês dois são foda de mais 🤩

Such a beautiful voice Bruno Have 😎😎
I LOVE YOU 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Lowkey I miss the sound after “tell me that your comin thru”
Oh my heart.. i want be that girl
Loved this rendition! Great vocal prowess and a lot of fun put in just as well! Never shy of EPIC for "Leave the Door Open", regardless of the presentation. Saw the keyboard player and Eric /Panda on the drums in the background. 🥰🔥❤
3:56 the girl in Selena's outfit 😍

I wish I had their swagger 😏
What’s happening line delivery was 🔥 👏 .PAAK

Never the same twice. ALWAYS A NOTCH HIGHER! ALWAYS!
I Love Bruno Mars❤❤❤❤
they weren’t even performing, they were just casually singing with the crowd.
Amor amor 🥰
Literally song of the year
This version look more relaxing~ It's always grand performance of them ❤❤🎉🎉
Niggas was saying Bruno can't sing live??? Yea AIGHT. Can't wait for the album and eventually the concert
Whoever gave this video a thumbs down, needs to reevaluate their life's priorities.
best 👍
Y'all were sooooo Extra and I loved it. Thank you for them vocals and keeping good music alive.
Bruno Mars is the best he's the rockest!! U suppose to do a song with The Weeknd... Maybe it'll be cool :0 :D
Okay let's manifest this song will win grammy
This song is like fine wine, it gets better with time.
I fainted.. but back now One!! They ALL ARE TALENTED
Fuck the dislike man  they are the jealoused ones
NEVER FAILED ME
Bruno steal all Andy girls hahahaahha!!!
that girl that ddo tiktok dance ruined the show
2:34 Esa chica ya ganó todo en la vida
🥰adoro
GG
👏👏👏 amazing
I believe this song is a chant to open a portal to the 1960's
They have the perfect showmanahip!! It's just beautiful to watch. I have watched all of the videos and been listening to his music for years and all their songs are good, dont get me wrong. I cannot pick out one that is my favorite, but I have to say, this collaboration is in the top 2 anyway. These guys, women love them... They seem to have an insight to a woman's heart!! As the old woman that I have grown into today, I see that these guys are rich with it, women will fall down before them forever dreaming of the guys that they see singing those beautiful songs. From my heart I want to believe that they are all worthy. I think they are. You can't pull a song out of yourself and not have a heart in there that is full of love. Mr. Bruno Mars and Mr. Pak, my many congratulations to you on your wonderful success. In my circle of people and music, entertainment, you take me back to a day in music when every word you sang meant so much to do many and your actually singing and I can understand your words and your meaning. God bless y 'all. Mucho mucho mas success.
Wow the was so amazing Bruno Mars
Always outdoing yourselves. You guys are an inspiration !!
Vocals and stage presence need we say more??
BRAVO 👏🏻 Goosebumps🥰 Their vocals so astounding 🙌🏻
O cara consegue cantar melhor a cada versão e voz desse cara é surreal pelo amor de Deus

Hi, first be healthy. Always choose organic foods then watch your favorite tv show
Just another perfect performance. The playful delivery, tongue it cheek battle, laughing while keeping it together giving the audience exactly what they wanted. So solid. Glad to have this in my life adding to the good stuff and giving the rough patches a far better sound track. 🐨💞

this right there is TALENT in it's true form
Maravilhosaaa!!!💕 Quanto talento juntos!!! Música que foi lançada num momento marcante da minha vida por isso nunca vou esquecê-la.
#andersonpak #brunomars they  did not  even pay attention to the melanin women sitting on stage. like none. they wouldnt even sing in front of them  that was weird they took it to the seventies with the style and the song's melody  but not with the groove  bc Because  not showing any attention to the melanin ladies on stage  made them not have the groove.  it was not a superb performance it was aight  naw that was akward and bizarre.
OMG ,i love it :)
Good stuff and they having fun with it!!!! Definitely a match for many hits to come as a group and individually. Give thanks, great display of showmanship!!!
🛐🛐
Y la cuando el álbum llevo más de 1 mes metiéndome a su perfil para ver si ya salió y no 🤧☝️

Why's the mic always so far from Bruno? Are his vocals that powerful or is it a singing trick?
They're tryna steal each other's show. xD Their chemistry on stage is something else.
Thought the was the Five Heartbeats up there

So nobody saw 👀 on 3:06 where Anderson Pakk got big mad at my baby Bruno for getting all the attention  😆 But I'm sorry Bruno Mars is the group you can't deny his talent
Damn this song is like fine wine. It gets better with age! "Biggest mansion door open" 😆 🤣 😂
録音音源より 生歌の方がクオリティー高いとかw
Bruno Mars is everything !!!!!
I'd be done fell on the flo lol
Aff slk 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Esse homem é tudo, meu Deus!!!!!
03:40 damn Bruno! Woooow!
I am so glad I needed to say this earlier. This is the kind of music I personally grew up with. It's naughty is sexual and sensual it's exactly what music should be like. It reaches in and touches your heart. It feels good to listen to and it feels good to dance to it it feels good to sing to and it's just a feel-good type of sound I am so glad the Bruno is bringing it back along with Anderson. Everything that I have seen Bruno do from the very beginning touched my heart and my soul that is what music is supposed to do to and for you. Many many blessings to you Bruno. Many blessings to you Anderson . I look forward to listening to you both together again hopefully soon.
so 2021 seems great so far
I'm a 30 year old dude leaving the door open 🚪
