Yeah spice is tripping.. 💯
Spice doesn't like to be called a bitch ,but calls people a bitch. Gtfoh lol
I CANT STAND SPICE BLUE HAIRED DEMON WITH ALL THAT MAKE UP ON WITH THEM YELLOW EYEBALLS SHES MEAN AND A HATER
Its not Bam responsibility to explain nothing for Erica wtf do Spice think she be talking too I cant wait til Bam put dem paws on her
Yandy  so pretty
1:43 is basically where Spice summed up her issue: Bambi saying "she hasn't spoken to Erica about it" when it shouldn't matter, because she was TOLD about what Erica did.  Bambi already said she was told by Sierra about what Erica said at 0:22. Then Spice confirmed it, then Sierra confirmed it at 2:18. So for the people who claimed Bambi doesn't know, that's just ridiculous because how many of you tell your friends some really juicy tea and don't wind up spilling the biggest details on the spot? BUT whether Bambi knew the full context or not, it's the WAY Bambi tried to avoid confronting the issue that hurt Spice. What she said was the PR version of saying, "I knew my friend did some messed up shet, and yall want me to speak on it, but I'm going to keep it cute and protect her and my friendship with her, so I'm going to give you some vague excuse instead".   Spice don't do fake. She doesn't like fake especially among her friends, and she considered Bambi one up until this point. The way she argued was very passive aggressive, and even kind of snarky, but there's a reason she act this way; yall just don't see through her pain to have any compassion or understanding for her at the end of the day.
“These girls are so lie” 😂🤣
It’s exhausting dealing with these females 😅
One year later and spice gone drake 😅😅
Everyone have everyone number why Bambi the target⁉️🤔Yes Erica was wrong but it's not Bambi fault.... Shekinah 🚬 smoking azz a s'it starter PERIOD 🤦
Spice Wig😂 stiff asf
Spice should be on baddies since she wanna fight so bad
Renni is me, I am Renni 🤣🩷
lol spice a Leo man that lion is the wrong want to piss off we don’t do fake. We gonna call shit out of the spot and don’t give a fuck who around
If Spice your friend why is Karlie not standing up? With my friends if they rocking I'm rolling
1st off its not being fake. Ideally you should not talk about someone if they're not there to defend themselves. 2ndly Bambi is not Erica's spokesperson. Why does she has to get in a problem that wasn't hers in the 1st place. If the issue is between spice and erica, then keep it between spice and erica. Simple! That's why problems get so out of hand, because everyone is poking their noses and giving opinions of a problem that didn't involve them to begin with.
It was "Giraffe" for me 😂
Every time I see spice with a blue wig … I think about Erica calling her a blue monkey
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Shekinah holding spice back "sit the fuck down" 01:22 😂😂😂😂😂
How you gone call somebody fake and get mad when they respond like spice is mean
I’m over spice !!! Get her off the show!
Spice is a ratchet damn mess!
“Oh you talkin to me now b*?” 😂😩💀
Spice was overreacting...like..girl..
Spice had it coming you was all in that girl business , than mentioned her child stop playing victim
They was being fake
It’s just crazy how Spice said why y’all be so fake and then Bambi jumped in saying Who so f**king fake and asked her who was she talking to and then they both go back and forth with each other. My level of anger went from 0 to 100 real quick
Im sick of Spice playing the victim and being messy.  Not looking at the show because Im sick of her messy behind!!! Take her off!!
Yandyyyyyy and Sppice🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤
K Michelle and Mimi❤
Hazel E e K Michelle🎉🎉🎉🎉❤🎉🎉🎉❤❤
Spice and Hazel E❤❤❤
#spiceeeeee🎉🎉❤
Go go go go sppppiceee❤❤❤❤❤
Mimi and Amara❤❤
Mimi always unbothered❤
Even though I think Sierra has some fakeness about her, she’s right about Safari being the one to start all of this. He’s always causing drama, and the women tear each other to shreds instead of addressing his being problematic. This is literally an example of art imitating life.
They were still friends with her after that though, so I’ll stop it
I am trying to see how is Spice the victim ...
What exactly was Bam supposed to do in this situation? Even if she had talked to her about that? Lol
I hope Spice leaves lol I can’t understand a damn word she says
Bambi, Erica, and Sierra should really call themselves the SAD girls, the way they always crying behind these men..projection at its finest
"OH YUH TALKIN TO ME NOW BTCH!???" PLSSS🤣😂😂😂😂
Y'all can fight after all that surgery somebody going get booked dangerous
Nobody talking about how Yandy brought Erica up knowing about Spice but okay
I’m a black woman and I don’t think Erica was wrong in no way. How that blue headed biiih gonna say tell Bambi she wasn’t talking to her but when Yandi asked Bambi a question Spice started talking shit. Spice always starting stuff and then wanna cry Wolfe. If I was Erica I would have said the same thing because spice had no right whatsoever to bring up her child. Talking about he dont like her, like why was that even necessary Spice you ugleee bihhh
Spice been going through it this season. She fighting for her life. 😂
She looks and sounds just like my old school math teacher in this scene 😂
Spice is always on 10 for no reason at all.
I watched this again realized BAM definitely talked out explaining that she hadn't talk to Erica and definitely looked shocked when Sierra told her the monkey ish Spice cut her off to say Ooo u didn't talk to your bestie Slick hell with and attitude Spice never gave Sierra that vibe when she talked to her about it so no you did to much boo
Oh I guess Spice can say what ever she want.
Bruh why spice fighting with everyone thats why they aint got no patience with her calling her monkeys n shit
Spice is a very rude person i hope she gets off show no positive energy sept 30 2023 team ericka and karlie bambi
Wow, Sierra looks scary
Im over the negative ish on this show.
This why she ain't win a Grammy
Spice is mentally ILL these days I liked her bc she was mature. Welll she is def acting crazy wtf blaming Erica’s friends. Jeez. And
At the same time why are you calling Bambi the b word I mean act like a lady
Lmfaoo why MIMi had to put on the accent “why you doh Talk to yuh best friend” 😂😂😂
Y are you always so fake spice faf 😂😂😂
Spice blows up on everyone then plays victim like ugh
Ever since Spice had her near death experience she has become very confrontational.  She really should give that energy to thanking God, and leave that other mess alone.
Sad adults that b..... word.
Spice was definitely talking to y’all  “why y’all so fake”?
Spice likes drama. She has issue with everybody. Just because they spoke to erica doesn't mean she brought up the name calling what are they teenagers. People say things out of anger. Just like when couples argue we call eachother every name we don't mean it and apologize after when calm. Spice should speak with erica without the tough act.
Yes Bambi is fake. She know damn well her friend Erica said that I don’t know why spice apologized to her after everything that was done to her. Bambi always wants to play the victim all the time.
I don't condone that Erica called her a monkey. But all bets are off when you come for my children. Once my buttons are pushed and you go low I'm going straight too hell!!!! Yes i do blackout where my mouth is lethal. Children are off limits whatever erica and her son situation is spice was being a  spiteful disrespectful b🤬. Listening to safaree  clown as🤬.
Why did yandi even bring the shit back up Bambi have u talked to Erica being messy n nosey...wack for that
Spice is doing too much. She has the big head and think she’s all that. Get off the show Spice. I would have called you more then that and I’m just as black as you. HUMBLE yourself!!!
All bs aside, the escalation on this scene is crazy! Spice say "why are y'all so fake" plural meaning y'all which means in fact she was also referring to Bambi too coming from the fact she did grill her. In her defense to say she wasn't talking to her is WILD though cmon now. I been watching this show off and on for years. I'm not picking sides but that was a bit extra.
These girls are so lie 😂😂😂😂
Producers call out these types of shows for still being made is biggest news. Even with all the information out there on how producers make them IN DETAIL. You could technically also watch and use critical thinking part of your brain and figure it out for self.
Can spice stop fucking yelling for 1 fucking episode .. Get a grip..
"Sit the f**k down! We just got the key the region!!  "Rasheeda! She got the key to the region, tell her!!"  Shekinah be having me rollin'!!😂😂😂😂
And do nothing nothing noise
Spice thinks because she won a Grammy she's that girl like spice is annoying
I don’t like Spice AT ALL 🙅🏽‍♀️
Spice did say why yall and got mad at bam lol
Spice to much, need to be 👊
Yandy so aggravating! She just told you they haven’t talk and you still wanna say “I’m interested to know what she said to you about the situation” like are you hard of hearing??
Bambi is fake & I don't like her. 🙄👊🏾
Bambi been getting dragged this whole season and I’m happy for it. Ion like her.
The 4 ppl between them looking back and forth is funty as hell to me 😂😂 I'll b with them looking as well
I really dislike spice... she is a waste of space bring back I Chrissy Cyn anyone but her god
Erica got a big ass mouth WE ALLLLL KNOW if sierra hasn’t talked to erica bambi sure as hell did
Spice was in the wrong, you should have a better attitude when you get a second chance at life. They're all grown, she threw a jab, and she asked who you talking to.... valid question when you call somebody fake. Ijs...
So everybody gonna just ignore the Eel that pull up
Btw spice is the same one that said RACISM wasnt real 😊
Am happy Bambi stood her ground. Spice is just angry because Erica went lower than she did and she got hurt in the process so now she’s coming after all Erica’s friends. Don’t ever mess with a woman’s child. Period.
Why is spice looking for trouble? Literally on edge to jump down people’s throat
I can’t ! GET RID OF BLUE HAIR PLEASEEEEE
OMG!!!!!
Good
Renni such a vibe bruh😭she just eating ha food and looking pretty I pray she remains that way.
Nice video
😮
If somebody calls me a monkey that is not black I'm coming for EVERYBODY... shes right she called them fake which is exactly how they were acting... you talked with your bff about this boo boo kitty so stop playing... and Bambi started it when she got called out... I'm matching your energy EVERYTIME... PERIODT
i swear hate spice!! she did way to much, and they didn't even say it! she mad bc they are her frineds and erica's not there for her to go off on, so she let it out on them!
Spice did too much. If she woulda stfu and listened BAMBI SAIYES I TALKED TO HER BUT SHES BEEN WORKING SO THEYVE BEEN BRIEF CONVERSATIONS. Which means, bitch yes I talked to my best friend  it joined is worried tf about you like you and shekinah. YOU aren't even a thought 🤷🏽‍♀️
You girls think I’m finna go against my Bestfriend and I don’t like y’all?  Delusional
Such a nice video uploaded..
As a black women I’m with Erica  y’all are tripping like as if black people are monkeys for real😂Erica called spice blue monkey cause she looks like one simple!!!🤣
Everybody really trying to eat they food
Tired of Spice now
lmaooo i just always laugh
For me it was Jandi and Mendeses way of looking back on so much speech and Bambi.
Nice
Spice is a btch and Erica friends don’t need to tell no one nothing about her . Loyalty
Wow wow
That's nice attitude table manners
Spice the problem but yall don’t see that and i love her
It’s funny how they belittle Bambi in an argument when she’s the toughest in the group.  Spice backed out when Tommie dared her.  You think Bambi will take a step back against Tommie?  She’ll punch her straight instead.  They need to know their boundary.
I hollered at the “why you haven’t talked to your bestfriend?” 😭😂
1:09 'WHO SO F*CKING FAKE WHO U TALKING TO?!!' Kills me every time 💀💀
SPICE AND MONICA SCOTT NEED TO BE FIRED!! AS WELL. GET RID OF THEM BOTH. MONICA RAN THE CLIP, MADE HER MONEY,  AND AFTER AND ONLY AFTER THEY EDITED THE CLIP FOR RAITINGS!!! SHE DECIDED AFTER "ARING" THE CLIP, TO FIRE ERICA. WASN'T ERICA AND SPICE ACTIONS CALLED FOR TERMINATION BEFORE AIRING??? MONICA DIDN'T FIRE ERICA UNTIL THE PUBLIC OUT CRY. THE PUBLIC SHOULD ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT CHOICE. IF NO ONE SAID A WORD! MONICA SCOTT WOULDN'T HAVE DONE A DAMN THING. SHE WOULD CONTINUE FILMING THE FIGHTING, HORRIBLE NAME CALLING AND WHATEVER ELSE THEY USE THE CASTS BACK FOR RAITINGS. SHE DON'T CARE ABOUT NONE OF THEM.
nice
Good video
SPICE IS DOING TO MUCH.  SHE WANTS PEOPLE TO TAKE HER SIDE. THAT FIGHT WAS BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE. HER AND ERICA. I DON'T LET NO ONE PICK MY CIRCLE OF FRIENDS. I ALSO DON'T SELL MY FRIEND OUT FOR NO ONE AS WELL. I DON'T HAVE TO AGREE WITH WHAT MY FRIEND  MAY SAY OR DO, WE CAN TALK THAT OUT, BUT IT DON'T MEAN I WILL SELL THEM OUT!!! MY FRIEND IS MY FRIEND ALWAYS.  I'VE HEARD THEM CALL WORST NAMES. LIKE "NIGG%÷." I DON'T  HEAR ANYONE MAKING A BIG DEAL OUT OF THAT. THE N WORD IS HORRIBLE.  NOT TO MEANTION WHAT WAS DONE TO OUR PEOPLE ON TOP OF CALL US THE N WORD.
Spice ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bambi is staying clear and minding her business as I would’ve. Spice is being a bully. Why does she care so much about her and Erica conversation
Super
Good video
Spice is giving she needs a storyline so bad
Spice is a troubled character and start fights for literally no reason at all she’s hypocritical asf like sit down honey and worry about your health because at this point she should be held accountable and responsible for her actions as well I can’t stand people on here cheering for her she’s nothing to be cheered about…. This is what’s wrong with the world now period people need to put the damn shoe in the other foot!!!!!! You can’t be mad being called a racial slur then turn around and call Bambi a giraffe bro so sit tf down she should be fired to
I will never understand why yall link up to dinner parties knowing your OPP is there.🤔🤷😩
Spice was mad at Erica.
Erica was wrong. At Rasheedas event was not the place. Grow up. Spice has the right to be upset. Be upset with Erica. Spice is always over the top at the wrong times. But they would do whatever they got to do for good TV.
Bambi doesn’t have to disclose her private convos with all of them wth is wrong wit people
Spice did say why “yall” so fake so she definitely was talking bout sierra and Bambi
they all old and ignorant cause spice wtf you that upset cause that girl said she didnt talk to that lady about you and erica drama.
Spice can’t be mad because Bambi doesn’t want to be involved in the foolery baby I wouldn’t have allow Spice to talk to me like that no way 🤣🤣🥊👌🏿
So no one else feels that Spice do things to make you come her head, broad couldn’t be in my circle, tie that as in a knot, I can’t with people
This divorce got Bambi aggressive AF!!!😅😅😅
SPICE THE HYPOCRITE called BAMS🦌a HORSE THATS HATE FUL THTS WHY ERIKA CALLED HER THE BLUE MONKEY 🙊 GOD SEES ALL….I FEEL LIKE ALL OF THEM ARE WRONG! SPICE CAME FOR ERIKA SON AND SHE CALLED HER A BLUE MONKEY PERIOD!

THIS IS JUST MESSY AND UNJUSTLY OF COLORED AND SPANISH / WHITE PPL AT THIS TIME
Spice is very Toxic for this show, she can’t even have a decent conversation, just jumping down anyone’s throat for no apparent reason‼️ so over her vulgar ways. The girls may be this and that but calling one names is sooo mean and overrated‼️Spice get it together or ur ass is next, u should have left with Erica anyways 🙄
Awesome
I never liked bambii from since basketball wives.
I'm sorry but spice is really trying to up her storyline because she didn't have anything before... First with Karlie, then Erica, & now Bambi 👎👎👎
Bambi and them teeth and gums🥴🥴😬
Spice. You been fake. U never liked these girls. Why you RIDING SO HARD FOR SAFAREE!!!??? LIKE WTF. BE FORREAL
You know damn well you all talked to your best friend after that big fight. It would've been best to say yes we did and then say you chose rather to not talk about it than to lie and say "no" she's right. They're very much FAKE.
Spice thought she was pressin somebody💀🤣🤣
I love Spice
Spice is my girl love her
In all honesty spice. ...has been having a very aggressive approach lately that's what got them into a heated argument with Erica ...coz Erica was calm and spice was having an attitude being rude n aggressive....same thing with Bambi just because she felt some type of way with Bambi not saying anything she starts attacking her n calling her names n Giraffe n stuff please ....i don't feel sorry for spice at all tryna play victim
Nice
Good
I don’t understand why everyone is coming for Bambi this season, like she’s going through a divorce, no one seems to be empathising just hanging up on her including scrappy, if he was a real man he would still defend her space but instead he gets his bitter old baby mama to start throwing her weight around.
Spice the trouble making problem  She should of stayed out the people marriage  Messy red eye lowlife
Everybody acting like Erica was wrong , spice should’ve of never brought up that girl son y’all like to pick and choose what y’all hear
I’m so sick of looking at sierra and Bambi with the glam on and wigs acting all like they so real. Vh1 needs to get them off the show. They in everyone else’s business and they so miserable. Too damn old to be playing mean girls with delusional Mena Sunday’s  Spice get ‘em!!
Spice a mess
Ya asses in the comments attacking spice when she was called a blue monkey by an Afro Latina she was alright to be mad
All adults and gets paid to make drama this is too toxic for the world. Spice this just makes Jamaican's look just the way they say we are. How u not well and still be like this. Someone calls you a blue monkey 🐒 and u come out looking like one and ready to jump off on others. What about your friends sitting around you and not saying anything they all black?  Yandy you love too much drama too shut up and eat your free meal butch
Spice doing too much 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Spice~ These girls are SO Lie And Shekinah already knew…. Sit TF down😂😂
Erica was wrong for saying what she did.   Spice is wack and the FAKEST of all the cast members. It always be the bitches with a  "dirty house" wanna cal someone else dirty.   Spice and Bambi weren't ever really friends... so why would spice expect Bambi to run and tell the ops what erica said about such a crazy situation.
I would say you ask her yourself  !!!!
I cannot believe this show still gets air time 😂
goooood
It’s starting to look like spice is becoming a trouble maker she’s been in so much drama lately
She’s even calling Bambi names so if Bambi would have called her a monkey now she’s wrong
Spice thinks she can talk to people the way she wants but BABYYY Bambi is the right one!! Bambi checked her real quick honey😂 Spice was talking to Bambi and cierra and didn’t think Bambi was gonna snap 😂 and still kept it cute and sat pretty … spice be doing the most
Spice was out of line
Ewwww.. yuuuuk.. noo nooo oh just nasty
Nice video
🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍
Is there any scene in this show of any franchise of Love and Hip Hop where someone doesn't say the phrase "At the end of the day..."? Literally every scene I come across of this show or any franchise has someone exclaiming this pointless cliche. I have never seen a phrase of any sort beat to death like that on a prior TV series.
Spice so fuckin annoying
Spice is getting too big for her britches, she needs to calm the hell down! She can dish it out, but she can’t take it 💯
Spice is annoying asf. She was poking the bear to try get bambi upset. The same shit she did to erica annoying assss bihhhh
Them some hungry bitches
Even though I think Erica used "monkey" as a racial slur.  However, did yall hear Spice call Bambi a giraff?  That plays to the argument that Erica called Spice a monkey because of her looks, nothing more. Nevertheless, Spice's anger is misdirected here.
Can u get off Spice slways jumping in the camera bout everyones stuff...Safari did not start anything. Pls. Weve been watching Ms aerica. Ehat she said insulted Billions of Black people Planet wide.
This lady gaslights often so Spice get her
Yes!  It's interesting to watch, but I don't like it when girls behave like that.  It's not entirely aesthetic.  Not good.
I don’t like Spice anymore she is always in other people’s business and provoking situations.
Y’all know Yandy always asks the questions that lead to everyone fighting
As she should Bambi is fake and 2faced!!!!
The fact spice was just on her death bed and still not humble gets me y’all plp need to do better
Spice.  Needs. To.  Relax.
But how is Spice mad after she said "YALL being fake " then say I was talkin to Sierra 😂😊
Good
Did she call Bambi a giraffe 🦒 now y'all wrong for firing Erica
Y'all where can I watch this on???
I think spice is still hurt and pissed with Erica and that’s ok but it seems she’s also pissed at anyone who hangs with Erica or she’s mad because she thought Bambi and Sierra were her friends and they aren’t really having her back on this . Either way I think it’s misplaced anger towards Bambi and Sierra,
Selective outrage! Where’s the same energy for spice? She’s comparing a black woman to an animal!?!? How is that ok?
They treating Spice like  Rasheeda and Mimi did K and I dont like it. But K pass all of them and Spice is getting ready to do the same thing💯
BAMMMBBIII NOOOOO..Nobody believe you did not talk to ERICA...BAMMMBBBIIII .Why you so defensive..CLEARLY..you know the story..POOR CIERRA....Facts Cierra has always tried to be the mediator...Cierra that friend..
Yall should not be on tv
Not to say Erica’s right but spice proving Erica right the way she acting 🧐
Please take this show off the air they are disgusting
bambi is so fake as spice said,and she clearly she doesnt like spce
Bambi didn't have this energy with Ericaaaaaa🙄😂😂😂
Yandi menderes,Rasheeda,kirk etc ate allllll fake for hearing spice call Bambi GIRAFFE
So spice can call Bambi giraffe 🦒 right
Spice is going through things, she feels like everyone is fake because of what she went through with Karlie
These girls are so lies 😂😂😂😂 I’m crying
Just wacth
SPICE DOES NOT REPRESENT ALL JAMAICANS. HER ANGER AND HOSTILITY IS UNACCEPTABLE ✔️
SPICE IS DOING THE MOST
PLEASE GET RID OF SPICE ASAP🤬
I don't think Erica was being racist she just said what she thought Spice look like with her blue hair that's all I don't think you guys should have got fired I won't be watching Love & Hip Hop no longer
Spice called Bambi a B!tch literally 20 times for nothing I'm no Bambi fan but Spice purposely started this argument over nothing! Yandy should never even asked Bambi have she talk to Erica! She knew that would start Spice up! Smh! Spice picks purposely then gets upset and wana fight when u respond!! Like she did Erica!! Smh! Mention my child and imma call u anything that comes to mind!! Erica didn't call her a blue monkey being racist it was her way of calling her UGLY!! Spice needs help she's really feeling herself over nothing her high school dancehall music is not it!! She needs to chill out coming for everybody I was done with her when she said to Erica "That's why your son don't like u! My son lovvess me!".... Wtf!! Smh!!..
It’s crazy to me because Erica has talked shit about other people’s kids before like Stevie J, she tried fighting his daughter and would talk shit about her.  All spice said was “ your son don’t like you “ that was a jab at Erica not her son. But everyone thinks Spice is wrong but yet no one held Erica accountable for saying the things she did to Stevie’s daughter or trying to fight her.
The way people are defending Bambi a black woman for not calling out her racist friend Erica is very appalling. For her to be friends with someones whose racist is also very appalling. Bambi doesn't actually care that Erica is racist which is what Spice was trying to say. The girl is fake and thats the truth and Sierra literally did an instagram live calling Erica and Bambi fake and Spice has a right to be angry at Bambi not calling her racist friend out on her bullshit. Shit if my non-black friend was racist I would drop you immediately but Bambi doesn't care because Erica wasn't racist to her
Spice can call Bambi giraffe but she can't be called monkey..... interesting 🤔
I mean I’m not talking about my friend at a table
Spice... the only one getting paid aND THEY BE HATIN...;'/
spice is so miserable and unhappy inside
Im just confused how bambi was talking and spice said to bambi, "bambi you havent talked to your bestfriend" then proceeds to say "why are "YALL" so fake" and when bambi ask who she talking to spice say "im not talking to you bitch" 🤣 smh.
How does it still come back to Safari? At the end of the day Erica is fake and so is Bambi.  Erica thinking spice slept with Safari but still pretending to like and be her friend is beyond fake and weird.
Spices, there was no reason for you to act like that. Ya they could have talked. Like Bambi said ya they talked, the conversation was short because Erica was working. Justs call Bambi to the side  and let her know why. No need to act like that.
Why is spice on the show again?
Why is everyone so scared of Spice tho 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️ Did she partner up with Mona Scott (creater of Love&HipHop) cause Spice is starting shitt wit everyone &everyone is allowing her to treat them  like shitt
Y Sierra a bring up Safaree name saying "he started all of this" Safaree DIDN'T STARTED ALL OF THIS! 😮🙄
😁😦😯😃 "YOU WANNA TALK, YOU WANNA TALK NOW BITCH?!"
I cant stand bambi ass, i hope erica stand up for her when something happen to her too.
Real fake
Bambi Gump (“I was born with big gums sir”) gets on my nerves!!!
Sierra does have a point. They getting mad over some shit that Safaree started.
But you don't like the word bitch but now you calling her a bitch
They all fake at the end of the day none of them are friends off the show so what's the problem
Atp they ALL been on vh1 for wayyy too long!!! They needa pursue something different!!
Very good 💯
Bambi needs to sit Tf down and go mind her business!!! Spice never spoke on her child she spoke on her PARENTING AND SPICE WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO MADE COMMENTS ON HER PARENTING… She Just Responded To Spice Cause She Mad That Spice And Safaree Is Mad Close. Sierra Stop It Cause You Was Dead Saying You Don’t Believe She Said That You Gotta Ask For Your Self So How Now You At The Table Saying” She Dead Wrong 😂😂. They Just Neva Been Around Someone Like Spice Who Don’t Hold Shit Back And Call Them Out When They Bullshitting 😂😂😂
Spice is over Bambi like girl hush 😂😂😂
We know  Bambi talked to Erica she  said earlier she had talked to her when  she  and  Sierra were  talking
Seriously yall coming for Erica when Spice came for MiMi for being light skinned so let's just think about it who really started all of this about color???
But spice acting like she not in the wrong either like both of y’all are in the wrong and don’t say I’m taking sides I’m not defending neither of them but stop acting like spice not in the wrong either when they both are call them both out
Spice really be looking for her moment on Tv 😂
Very good 👍
This ridiculous show is so scripted and cringe. Stop it.
💕 Leo Spice .
😂tha way Mendeecees and Yandy turned their heads from Bambi to Spice in unison😂😂
The blue gorilla is that it again😂😂😂😂😂 Bam did nothing wrong but the blue gorilla got upset again lol
Spice toe up nobody saying that
Idk if they painting spice in a bad light but she really irking me with how she handles situations.. Just childish…
Y’all crazy spice attitude is insane.. it’s like literally watching a big ass child… spice literally talking to people how she want and when they give her back the energy she acts like it’s out of no where.. she was throwing shade the entire time and talking out her neck over something Erica said.. bambi literally said she spoke about it but they didn’t get in details due Erica working .. I don’t understand what is fake about that… they literally said Erica was wrong after they was told about the racial slur… spice taking out her anger on them is childish… Erica was dead wrong but that don’t give Spice the right to act like a cunt with others who had nothing to do with that incident.
Lol
Safari somewhere like I aint did nothin in nene voice
It's like spice came off of her death bed so angry and full of rage and vengeance! She's really behaving like a ratchet animal !
Chile spice shut tf up you do the most
that blue bob wig 😂😂😂😂😂
1:29 Mendeecee = if minding your business was a person! 😅
It’s crazy how everyone is defending Erica. Yes Spicy was wrong for saying something about her child but I’m not saying a racial slur because that’s like Spicy saying racist to her 🤦🏽‍♀️smh
Glad I’m not a follower! Ppl who are upholding Spice at this moment is foul AF!
Sierra love blaming the niggas…get yo shit together
Spice dorecting her anger at the wrong person. Bambi didnt actually do anything wrong here
Spice is ignorant af and it shows
Spice is doing too much 😫
Don't blame Safari Sierra
I don't like spice
YO Spice Realness 💯
All of them are fake
I liked how bambi handled it at the beginning it was like spice was pushing it to get her mad but she didn't let it get to her
She said she wasn't talking to Bambi but she said yall🤔😂😅.. so apparently she was talking to Bambi too😆
These three lil girls have been messy and  it has been laughable. At what point is enough enough. This entire incident just reveled Erica carried feelings for Spice as her Ex mentioned. Over the years almost everyone has questioned her about her son, why get racist now? These girls have always been messy but it was entertaining right?
Spice cant be mad at bambi because of what erica said thats just dumb. She doesn't have to tell spice what they talked about
Remember episode when Spice was changing her skin tone..... Painting herself light some how. Some complex; industry or self...I don't remember. Spice is living on an all time high with sympathy from backlash of Erica's bigoted remarks. This has a pinch of self deprecating in it👀
I need to watch the season because these clips don’t match these comments. I see nothing wrong with spice behavior this season. She almost lost her life. Her friends weren’t there for her . The fakeness is triggering n she tired of ppl bs.
*sigh* these girls are so LIE
Now spices is being messy
Spice do too much as always. But Bambi and Sierra know dayum well they wasn’t gonna get a ways with that fake ass response lol. I would’ve said y’all grown ass woman and y’all both need to figure out y’all own problems. *continues to mind my own dayum business*
Good
Spice is turning up! Not the giraffe 🦒 😂 . Spice wanna fight the bf cause she can’t get to Erica. Sierra always kissing ass. 😫
So what happened?
Shut up Spice should’ve never spoke on that women’s motherhood.
Y’all are funny, because Erica earlier that season of love and hip-hop was talking to scrappy about his parenthood with his daughter and scrappy answered back, saying she herself does not have a relationship with her son, so she should not judge him. No one clock that, but when spies do it, it’s a problem in fact I love to point out the hypocrisy of  how we can till men that they are dead beat fathers and how they don’t t take care of their children but it’s wrong to keep the same energy to women who are also dead beats or who don’t take care of their child love how we can talk to a men about not being good fathers to their children to their faces on social media, however it’s wrong when a women is being called out 😂 y’all saying spice is wrong it’s straight up dumb and stupid and hypocrites
Is Erica wrong for calling Spice a blue monkey yes she is, but to verbally attack her friends is nonsense. I don’t even like Bambi but I can tell she wasn’t trying to add fuel to the 🔥 and besides she didn’t say it🤷🏽‍♀️ Erica already took a loss for actions so what now😂 Spice is going hard for Safari but she’s overlooking the reason why the feel so comfortable saying things like that is because of our self hating men putting them on a pedal stool, just stating facts.
Spice is burnt out with everybody
Im surprised that karli red didn't say anything.. 😂😂😂
Spice is Love and HipHop now
Spice too much. Mi love yu but nope.
Spice dont like being called bitch but calling bambi out ….chileeeeee i would of been came cross that table and showed her what this bitch about 🤧🙄
So spice is carrying this season??? Gotcha lol
I can't understand y spice is so upset ...the word best friend alone should tell u the girl doesn't need to tell u want she and Erica talked about daaaahhh
Spice is doing too much now!!!!!
Love n Hip Hop is just not entertaining as it was in the beginning. All the bickering back n forth is annoying.
Spice is a Jamaican racist hater herself. She’s starting to show it the way she talks to the American black actresses too.
What’s going on what did we miss y’all were all good season 9&10😊
take spice off the show and watch the dynamics change
Spice is doing way too much then you wanna play victim when you keep coming for these women!
Maybe she didn’t speak to her about it yet
She brought up scrappy kids and his situation and he brought up her son but yet she didn’t get as disrespectful. Steve j brought up her son and her not taking care of him after she called his kids Bebe kids. If he would’ve disrespected her as bad as she disrespected spice he would’ve been wrong.
Bambi is deadass lying! something major happened and you haven't spoken to your best friend about it really?????? please GTFOH
The fact that Black people let alone a Black "Woman" is defending this racist goes to show you how low some of our self-esteem is. Erica knew she was wrong that's why she never mentioned calling Spice a monkey to her or Sierra. This isn't the 1st time it's been done and it won't be the last, only if some people would learn to love themselves and stop defending our oppressor's helpers and emancipate yourselves from mental slavery.
I love spice
Spice getting them..🤣🤣🤣
Now if she would've called her a monkey after the bitch and giraffe comment everyone would've been bashing Bambi 🙄
It's about time she called it like it is my girl Spice
i thought spice don't that bih but i see she call bami out your name 5 times. I guess she got use of the word
Yandy brought up this conversation, of course. ugh. i can’t stand her. and i can’t stand Spice. I can’t stand Erica either lol. my fav is Sierra.
Spice is aggressive calling Bambi out her name but crying and lying to everyone for sympathy bc she nos she was wrong but calls Bambi a giraffe is that racist
Spice so fake and VICTIM
Spice need to take that energy to the women she got beef with. As a best friend I’m not required to speak on my best friend behalf on why she said what she said and if I choose to not disclose information or you feel like I’m being fake then so be it spice take that up with miss Erica once you stated her son doesn’t like her after you were pillow talking with her ex husband then anything is up for grabs people don’t play about their kids you threw a gab at her and she threw a few back this is why it’s best to leave kids out grown folks situations you threw spice and she got spicy
Nobody’s talking about how y’all call each other black bitches y’all call Bambi horse face and all that other shit calling her horses and ugliness ugly that like y’all should’ve been fired. All y’all should’ve been fired. Ericka should’ve never said what she said, but at the same time spice just had surgery and she’s trying to fight this girl she calls everybody else names and everything else but at the same time Bam is trying to have a reasonable logical call Com collective conversation and yet who is the loud one who is call n this woman bitches and everything else like come on y’all sitting up here rashing on Bambi for what? Bam is not the problem spice stop sitting up here yelling at this lady. You don’t know what her conversation was with Ericka she sitting there trying to tell you, but you keep yelling and screaming calling her bitches but yet here she is not said, not one disrespectful thing toward you, but yet you sit here wanting to fight her call her bitches, and every name in the book maybe your ass should be fired Next it doesn’t make sense and everybody’s trying to give you credit for. Do you know whatever like girl sit down I like you to spice and I always had a had loved your music and everything else but you went way too far after just having surgery. What is Bambi said something about your kids what if spy said song or Ericka said something about your daughter or your son you would’ve done the same thing so the person to blame safari safari went to you flirting with all your friends y’all are all friends safari went to you instead Ericka Diddys, Ericka didnt Ericka Diddys Ericka did that but you you sat there and you took safari search. Safari was done with Ericka that he should’ve never went to her house and slept with her at her cookie, but yet he did so obviously he’s the one who started the whole drama
You know dang well they not going to talk, not with that energy! They going to throw them hands!!!😅
Spice and Her Bob Were stressed out u hear me???
When did spice start call ppl dem bi*ch she didn’t like it when Tokyo was saying it so why she say it tv get to ppl real bad 😭😭😭
It’s Shekinah at 1:41 saying “She just got the Keys to the Region, tell her!” 🤣🤣🤣  But in all seriousness, I’m Team Spice, but I want her to calm down, so they don’t blame her for everything!
Yandy and Shekinah always trying to start some mess
I want Spice gone!!!!!!
Why is she so extr spice
SPICE WAS WRONG
I love you Spice...but my dear your wrong and taking it out on them because you don't ikea Erica that's the bs I'm going through people hating on me because I know them please stop it...that's hurtful 😢
Spice needs to get off that show.
My opinion is spice was saying about Bambi was being messy because she is
I think everybody is forgetting the fact that spice is upset because everybody claimed to be cool with her or her friend but when Erica said what she said they are either not believing it or taking Erica’s side that is fake so me personally yes I would lash out on everybody because don’t sit in my face and be fake but behind closed doors your actually agreeing or discrediting the fact that someone Called me a racial slur 🤷🏾‍♀️
Spice is starting with everyone. She’s giving mean girl..🙅🏽‍♀️
Spice called Bambi at least 10 bitches and 2 giraffes in this 3 minute video.
I can’t understand for the life of me how they are that calm.  I was heated and she didn’t say ish to me.  Stand up or stand for nothing.
Why didn't Stevie get cut after calling Mimi Erica Dixon and Arian slut monkey's?????
For Bambi and Sierra to say they didn’t know nothing then turn around and say they told each other it was crazy what she said told me everything I needed to know . Miserable ass women
Spice just like karlie !
Poofters and hip hop you mean!!! But this one is trash and not hip hop!!!!
Spice was wrong. Bambi wasn’t  lying.
Grace show off bring disgrace
Erica got fired, so why is Spice carrying on this victim narrative...like she's not the only one whose been called a racial slur & she can't expect everybody to agree with her all the time. She's been getting so much attention & going off on everybody. Bambi can fight so she might want to calm down with all the Rah rah, plus didn't she just have a near death experience?? Sit down for you get ya tail whoop...i'm tried of her
Spice you are chartic
I don't like Bambi, but spice is doing way to much.  She needs to put that energy into her whack ass music
Spice is such a leo😂😂❤
Bambi Forgot Who SHE Was Talking To When She Asked SPICE With Aggression , "WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?!" Like Bambi Can Fight Or Something 😂😂😭😭‼️
Subconsciously Bambi knew she was being a liar she instantly had an attitude but tried to pretend she being polite with the keeping. If the polite face but the snide look in her eyes and facial expressions and her tone. 😂 she instantly felt attacked and you can tell. An only the devil feels attacked instantly. Always knowing ain't up to know good. 😂
I don’t like this for spice anymore
This should not have been made about race at all.  I do not feel that Erica Mena was being racist in any fashion.  When Spice was on Tokeo Vanity about her weight everyone thought it was funny but she was being a complete bully now that she got a little clout on this B list blank show now she wants to come for people and conform herself for a check.  I feel that Erica is going through some real trauma and needs help with it.  We are all adults and Erica should be held accountable for her word choice but to call her racist NAWWWWWWW!! If I was in this situation I would feel the same and why her ex-husband is running to her friends for comfort when he is the asshole in this entire mess she feels that everyone is turning against her and I see it they all are turning against her when she is the SHOW.  The same thing with Yandy ass and her getting that young lady to run up on Lil Mendeese mother because they both were telling the truth and tried to make it seems that they were apart of the bitter baby mothers group when in fact everything they said about her was facts and her husband is aware of this period. You see MONA didn't give them a spin off to speak on that. Love and Hip Hop will be over soon without ERICA MENA I can see that in the near further so all those checks will be GONE!!!!!
Bambi & Sierra a big hypocrite frm longer time
Spice is so combative...isn't she the one that don't like to be called a bitch!  But she can throw out the bitch word to others so freely!
😂😂😂😂😂
Yandy looks pretty
I didn't see kirk at the table 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bambi better than me Spice woulda been rice, she said bitch one to many times 😂😂😂😂
Now yandy know damn well.......😂
Spice needs to have several seats, she's too much of a s--- starter.  She is a instigator. So what if Erica went to Bambi, you told your friends.  You're fake too Spice
Spice did to much at that damn table period.All this is Safaree fault because he shouldn’t never meet up Spice last episode about his ex-wife Eric and they kids. Maybe Erica and Spice wouldn’t never got into last episode. SPICE NEED TO STOP TAKING UP FOR SAFAREE CAUSE SHE DONT KNOW WHAT GO’S ON WHEN THEM 📷 IS OFF
spice shit up and sit down, u doing way too much for nothing.
That blue wig gots to go she needs to calm her ass down don’t like her fakeness
Spice wants people to ignore what she said to Erica as if that didn’t play a HUGE factor on what and why Erica said what she said.
Spice did entirely way too much
Yandy is sooooooooooo MESSY and Spice is a hot head.
A bunch of grown women acting like middle school kids 🤣 It's never a peaceful moment with these women omg 😂
On the flip side how is it Spice can call Bambi a giraffe 😒🤔
Honestly, this conversation took place in the wrong place at the wrong time. Kirk and Rasheeda paid ane flew them out there to celebrate Rasheeda's birthday, not to bring Atlanta drama to the damn Bahamas. They could've dealt with that later. Bambi was right to attempt to mind her own business. They are too old to be escalating mess.
Everything is safari fault. Kmft these butches need to grow up
I see a lot of people trying to downplay spice. Spice has been in the industry when I was under 10. None of the women there are on her level for one. & 2 yall keep saying spice started it idgaf If she started it or finished it, nothing she said was okay for racist remarks 👎🏽 go 2 h3ll.
Yandy n her husband the classiest people they ever been around  Im over watching middle aged women acting so ratchet all the time its ridiculous we better 🙄
Bambi is fake she always d riding sierra aswell
If these bitties so rich n successful why tf they always arguing n fighting?!
Spice is the Fake one get it together sis
Bambi- we didn’t really go into it that much  Also bambi- I have talked to her but not about that🤦🏽‍♂️  Wtf else is a bigger topic??? Work?
Spice has to go………
Spice has gotten big head she didn't like being called a Monkey but she sat up here and called Bambi a Giraffe
Spice started everything and got Érica kicked out she a hater
Spice brings up everything and ruins dinner no one was bothering her now spice just looks like a hater she used to be all for woman now she’s against them no one acted out on anything and she’s calling the girl a b
Nahh im over spice frfr this isn’t for you girl go back to the music
Erica was wrong point blank period!!!!!! Calling someone a money was dead ass disrespectful!!!!But also Spice is wrong too she be going off at the mouth blabbering on and on. When you mention folks kids ain’t no telling what’s gonna come out !  She giving out negative energy too m! At the beginning of her coming on Love and Hip Hop she was more genuine and was never in mess and to me she instigates!
Y’all trying to gaslight Spice. Fuck Erica, she’s been calling black people monkeys so the shit ain’t got nothing to do with her son.  The tight face crew sits up and talks about everything, so this is the one thing they didn’t talk about? Really?
you diss my kid or my parenting skills im calling you a Gorilla lmfao
Fight fight fight..Fight club
I dont care what nobody say spice is wrong look at her face before anybody said anything she cant get to erica so she won't her friends you cant tell she want the smoke
I can never be on this show 😂😂😂I don’t talk much but watching this says I might have a short circuit
Smh
Yall saying she had a second chance at life, doesnt matter. She was enjoying her life, if you watch outside of the show 😂 til erica was acting like she wanted safaree. Yall only watch the show but take a look of her actuall life. Yall forget they be are on a screen and stuff can be edited anytime.😂 how would yall feel tho if someone called u a monkey??? And the friends that claim they “love spice” and are black aswell, are quiet as a church mouse?? Yall buggin
Idc what nobody say Bambi not no punk 😂😂😂😂I love it❤❤
When people are in the wrong they get loud and that’s all imma say
UCI spice jumps up in people face then she worried about her incision and she had surgery but she jumping up like she want to get busy she need to sit down and shut her mouth she really ain't about that life so she need to sit down😢😢😂😂
Bambi and Sierra are fools for real being best friends with a racist. I’m so ashamed to be a black woman.
Someone slap spice already! She's mad at everyone but herself!!
Good video nice time
Yall acting like yall would tell people about the conversation you and your friend had. Its not nun of her business what erica and bambi talked about. Some of yall probably would tell yall friend business
I ain’t never liked Spice since she was picking on Tokyo idk why y’all glorify Spice so much she makes my skin crawl
Spice is so annoying
Ummm I’m not telling my friend opp anything either 🤷🏽‍♀️….spice & Bambi not friends. Spice don’t have her own kids (unapologetic opinion) annnnnnnnnd she was hella messy with Kendra & Joc with her friend before he got married & treating Karli for no reason….showing how Jamaican women really rock with AAW. Now screaming at Bambi cuz she not repeating her & Erickas conversation 🙄 & people condoning this cuz she was called a monkey….
Eric did spice wrong truth but I don't like this spice in this season seriously. I used to have so much respect for her but nope. It's like she has a problem with everyone. If people don't come to you when you sick mute them off. If people don't comment when something bad happened to you ignore them.
Spice is so quick to talk shit but when anyone claps back she likes to plays the victim
Spice just don’t take no shit and don’t like fake shit
Spice doing too much…
Spice but you was talking to her, she punk😊ed you😂😂😂😂😂😂
You know this is a planned fight dinner scene when all you see is salad on the dinner table😂😂
I’m sorry. But Spice act like she can say anything to ppl and expect no one to clap back. She always come out her mouth aggressive and with the wrong choice of words. Her reasoning may be valid, but she don’t get to the root of it because of how she says stuff.
SPICE NEEDS TO CALM DOWN,  DOING AND SAYING WAY TOO MUCH. SOMETIMES LESS TALKING IS LESS AS TO SPEAK VOLUME.  PLUS SPICE, the wigs are not say 1, look into them. manners and respect always
Birds OF A FEATHER CERTAINLY FLICKER & FLOCKED TOGETHER.
Its a SHAME SHAME SHAME how black women exploiting themselves for notoriety and or fame...   Then to see and hear all this messy mess to be fighting and carrying on like some hoodlums hooligans and ratchet antics.
Spice is a HUGE poop stirrer. She brought up children and has stuck up for trashy Safaree and spoke terribly about Erica but that's Kool?! Erica is not a racist by far. She should not have called her monkey! She looks much more like a silver back gorilla. This show is full of it. Cast members have referred to numerous Spanish cast members as enchiladas, tacos, illegals and much more but that's Kool? Also, monkey has been thrown around on this show before but that was okay because the cast members who said monkey were black! Make it make sense. Erica should have left this show a Longggg time ago. Bambi should as well as several other ladies who are just too good for this type of show. Spice should have been suspended and Erica should not have been fired. In my opinion the show could have killed this scene. They edit and omit as they see fit. This is terrible. Now a woman has her livelihood jeopardized. This show wants people to throw jabs and then wash their hands when there is any heat on them. BS! So many garbage cast members like Shekinah? Why? She is worthless and I can list a host of other worthless awful cast mates but why bother...diamond? Momma Dee, Kirk, Rasheeda, and so on and so on BORING OLD wack C- actors.
Is this really a story line😮
Spice called it
I notice that these women be literally tearing down a man character and their manhood so it can benefit them. Erica how you got him is how you loose them  she did this to another women who was married and want him to leave his wife and kids for her. You wish bad on someone else marriage but want someone to feel sorry for her and be on her side.
Bambi and Sierra defending Erica’s racism is beyond weird. I’m completely done with them 🙄😒🚮
The Fact That People (Mainly Black Woman) Tried To Claim Spice Got Aggressive First Really Grinds My Fucking Gears. Even If That Was The Case She’s Rightfully Obligated To Do So Since It Is HER Situation That’s Being Discussed And Because As Anyone Can Clearly See Spice Was Asking The Right Questions, Again Since It Was Her Confrontation To Began With As Well As Yandy. Bambi Was The Aggressive And Clearly Got Bothered With Spice For Holding Her And Sierra Delusional Ass Accountable. Spice Is Better Than Me Because As Soon As My Situation Would’ve Been Brought Up I Would Already Be On Go. The Fact That Y’all Keep Making Excuses For Erica’s Racial Insults Against Black Women Is Really Unfathomable. Spice Never Disrespected Nor Talked About This Lady’s Child So Let’s Cut The BS , When She Mentioned Him She Was Referencing To Erica’s Parenthood. Not One Time Did She Verbally Demean That Young Man. TF Are Y’all Talking About 😅. A Lot Of Y’all Talk Just Cause Y’all Have The Mouth To But Be Making No Sense Whatsoever.
SPICE IS MAD BC SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE SAID WAS WRONG. SPICE IS A CLOWN.
Oh my God Spice is my boo
I thought Spice didn't like that Bit** word
Like the eaters
Spice always look dirty to me😏
I understand Spices anger and passion, but girl, you are recovering from serious trauma. Take better care of yourself. How r u letting people take you to dark places
And throw bambi tf away tooooo. Cuz I'm so over her nobody important ass... she is never giving  at all.. she is a tag along to girls who are actually doing things in their life... Bambi is FAKE... she lied about her age and all... girl faked her way in to a marriage that exposed her as the escort she is... 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉music is trash
Take spice away and the tight face crew it’s annoying atp😒
when spice was "u talkin to me now bish" i was donee😂😂😂
Spice is annoying and a bully she starts a lot of shit
No but ppl out here talking about they should fire spice for calling Bambi a giraffe wen a daim giraffe is an animal it doesn’t really mean anything the casts have been calling each other b*tches  from the start of the show and a b*tch is a female dog so I guess  they finna fire the whole daim cast🚶🏽‍♀️
Lets be real ppl just don't like Bambi hating on her for whatever reason. Spice always start shit and ppl love her. I swear the black community love the narrative of being a shit starter like you calling bambi a giraffe put want ppl to feel sympathy about erica calling you a monkey this what i meab. Not saying erica wasn't wrong but black women need to start taking accountability with what we say and do. I hate seeing black women argue fighting and being ratchet.
The wig is giving blue monkey and I don’t care what y’all say😂
WHY IS SPICE SO ANGRY ALL THE TIME? WHY IS SHE ALWAYS STEPPIN TO PEOPLE WITH SO MUCH DISRESPECT AND AGGRESSION? SHE BROUGHT UP ERICA'S SON AND MAKE A SLICK COMMENT AND NOW THIS? SEEMS TO ME SPICE IS THE ISSUE! WHAT KIND A FRIEND ACTS THIS WAY ON A VACATION U WERE INVITED TOO AND WAS SPECIFICALLY TOLD NI DRAMA!?! U DO THAT SHIT ON MY DIME/TIME A VACATION I INVITED U ON? U GETTIN 🐕 🐕 WALKED SLL UP AND DOWN THE BEACH. SPICE NEEDS TO GO!!
Spice need to come off the show. Cant stand her...
Spice I hope you heal soon. We can see all your projections and being all extra defensive. Is there something you wanna say? Ppl only act like that when they have a secret 🤨🤔🫣
The Love & Hip-Hop B.S. is all scripted these people get paid around 70k to 90k just to do these shows none of it is real it's just another agenda to depict black women as getto and wretched
Spice was also wrong for talking about Erica’s son
Spice called Bambi a giraffe because shes tall Erica called Spice a blue monkey because spice always quick to jump and fight shes act like one so i dont see the problem here
Who tf does Spice think she is?? Bambi doesn’t owe her any explanation girl shut up
Spice keeps running up on ppl she should've been dropped a long time ago. And shes funny talking about Bambi is fake and a lie but spice is literally going around saying erica called her a black monkey to switch the narrative knowing she didnt say that
I think Bambi didn't want to get involved🤷🏽‍♀️and she could have just said "noo, I don't want to be involved. Everything is just too much for me I have my own personal issues" Because it's clear Spice is upset, as she should be.
Spice outta Pocket as a black women bam doesn’t have to kiss her ass that is crazy
I’m sorry I love spice but some times she needs to just leave it alone and let it be she putting herself in the drama and she is too real for them
Spice behaves so ugly , always the most aggressive person in the room these days smh
Hold Spice accountable
Lmfaoooo how you gone call your baby father the N word and your babies are part N word 😂
It’s spice calling her a giraffe, like that’s not cute 😂
One thing about it Erica haven't said a word the quiet ones is ones you have to watch for 😊 everyone out here bashing her and getting her fired when in real life we talk down on one another  as black people  it makes it ok because we the same color no that makes us a racist to against one another
Spice needs to calm down. If she thinks Bambi and sierra are lying oh well she has no proof of that for her to get all worked up like that.
Specie ready to give the energy to anybody that want it. Hell I feel her on that.
Spice know damn well she was talking to Bambi.....stop trying to drag Bambi into Erica drama...stop tryna make people side up ...and FYI, Erica not White 🙄🙄🙄🙄 spice always tryna fight ,..tired of her and her wigs FOH
Seems to me spice has a problem with bambi bcuz she already called her a giraffe . She's coming at her even more lately bcuz shes friends with erica is just wild to me. Bambi ain't got shit to do with spice and erica issues. What's really her beef with bambi bcuz it ain't over erica for sure.
Bambi knows what was said but they try to be loyal to there Friends We something else Erica crazy self going to swith on her butt then she be a monkey and 🦒 giraffe next....
But spice is 100% right !
So u see Spice just called Bambi a Giraffe and that’s ok right smh
Your having that energy for the wrong person getting upset with Erica friends won't help you and the last time I checked most of you on this show is phony sit down and talk women to women and let your kids see your better than that.
I don’t even comment like that but spice needs to realize that’s some of these people are not her friend point blank . Even celebrating her accomplishments they talk about things that’s not appropriate to have it’s a time and a place 🤷🏽‍♀️.
I dont care for spice any more
Bambi sitting there lying
Why was Yandy so invested? Spice must have put her up to asking her about Erica.
It's Karlie minding her business and eating her food for me 😂😂😂
Spice with the accent I’m in love ❤
I’m team spice on this one all the way however spice love fight women on the show for calling her a B but she just called Bambi it 100 times 😂
Spice literally said why YALL so fake after Bambi and Sierra were talking Bambi had every right to ask who tf you talking to Spice tripping and clearly need her ass beat properly
SPICE will get you right on together.  She is not here for backpedaling and not holding someone accountable because they are your friend. BAMBI you must talk fast for Spice. all that slow bs making something up on the spot crap Not gone work.
KIDS ARE OFF LIMITS WHEN ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO STOP?
It’s yandy and Mendelee face for me 😂
I'm not defending Erica but didn't spice bleach her skin trying to look white at one point? 🤔 If Erica's comment about spice hurt her feelings,then what made her or who said what to make her want to bleach her skin?🤷
Why is spice worry about Erica .
Spice once again just doing too much, both arguments she’s the aggressor. Nothing will be done though.
If Spice and Yandy want to know what Erica talked to her friends about, just get on a phone and ask her.
Spice you need to relax... you are wrong too
I would have called her everything in the book too spice is gonna get her karma she is disgusting..... You talked about this woman child.
SPICE! leave this toxic franchise,  you are doing more than well, and these "friends" are gonna bring you down because they will never have what it takes to be relevant. Love yah
Spice was clearly disgusted by the fact Bambi’s acting like she didn’t talk to Erica about a situation and is okay with Erica calling Spice a Monkey instead of saying I heard about the monkey comment and that’s fucked up. Bambi will forever be the dumbest broad that ever walked this earth. I don’t understand how so many black women are OK with being called a Monkey or Any Racial Slur.
Spice need to grow up
Spice is correct 💯 Bambi is fake af. I never really cared for her jump off 🍑 to begin with. She had no story only the girl that gets around! Even tho she threw the first dagger, Erica knew exactly what she was doing when she called her a monkey. I've been trying to educate black people that we are on our own. Hispanics or Latinos or whatever they classify themselves as, will always be extra racist towards black women or a black person in general. It just baffles me that the community is slow in response to Erica calling Spice a monkey is trying to justify what Erica said. But when it's your own people calling each other monkey's and putting each other down you're ready to kill your own kind vs letting this racist pos say what she wants without consequences because she's lighter toned and believes she's superior because she's more equal to her white counterparts than her Afro Latino side. Wake up people they using the hell out of our culture while having black babies. You can still be racist and have a partner of different background. Educate yourselves y'all. I'm tired of people coming for us when all we do is exist. Spice was wrong as well but the monkey thing is extremely hard to come back from. Y'all gone learn smh. This world is confused and complete 🗑️.
Spice is the problem
Erica lost another gig. I'm not watching anymore. There has been so much that went on, and she gets fired. How is she going to feed her children? Love and hip hop makes her look bad. You don't hear anything negative about her until she appears on love and hip hop. Praying for her
It’s giving bully.
Spice is hot mess she needs to go go
Spice is now exhausting me too… I guess she’s fully healed from all those medical issues she’s had.
I just wanted to say that anyone who defends erica is guilty of racism by association. Argue with your keyboard cause ofcourse spice insulted her but not her race. If spice were to hurl an insult on her to do with the latinas, spice would have been cancelled but people have guys to bring up the weirdest excuses for erica. America is definitely not free from racism at all yall definitely live in an illusion
Realistically, what do they want Bambi and sierra* to do? Yeah they can hold Erica m accountable, but why would they go back to tell spice anything?
Erica was wrong af, but it's so disappointing to see Spice literally have a second chance at life and still choose to fight, argue, curse, and cause drama. Smh, ppl usually refuse to engage in petty shit after a near death experience.
Spice is wrong
Bambi is trash.... idk anyone is surprised Bambi is defending Erica for being anti black... she's colorist herself... whatever bs Erica gets Bambi into is deserved at this point
People are just hating on spice because she kept it real and or mad that she have a opinion and a voice of her own. Spice don't give a fuck, she might not be an American entertainer but she is well celebrated in the Caribbean on the world she is very well known. Thus, having a career outside of VH1. There are sum people who think Caribbean people shouldn't have a voice.. I love you spice let bitches know this realty tv and not fake tv bullshit. with that said I think Erika feeling was hurt, most people uses her son, which took her back in time because that's always lowblow for her.I think she should be giving a second chance (Spice my girl, let VH1 know to put Erika back on the show as this is a growing opportunity for everyone involved).Thanks!
Am confused ass hell a black can call a black person the n word an its ok right so help me out here
But spice calls Bambi a giraffe she need to be fired
Tbh erica was wrong for even calling spice that. I understand that she got mad at spice for saying something about her son yet erica talks crap about other people kids soooo. Bambi and sierra and Erica are fake asf like literally. If somebody said a racial slur to u ofc ur gonna react in an negative way bc why would they say that about u. Spice has every right to act the way she acted
How dare you sit there on your black fake azz and say "why you so mad?" i cant take these fake ...............(so and so's)
Yall watching a show forgetting how it works in real life........ 1st if im talking to you and you tell me that "you cant compare us because your son dont like you but my son loooves me" not only am i popping u in your mouth imma call you EVERY animal on Old McDonald's farm .......and Every cuss word in Webster's dictionary...... 2nd if Bambi did not want to get too deep into the conversation between her and Erica she doesn't have to.......thats their friendship and not every thing has to be known to others .........
The fact that y’all are lowkey trying to defend Erica in the comments. She was wrong and her friends (black women) should have checked her on that. Idgaf how long they’ve been friends. Racist remarks and wishing death on others is never okay.
Nah bc Spice trying to lash out on Bambi bc of Erica is beyond absurd. Bambi is Erica's friend, not her PR Manager or her Publicist. Spice acting like Sierra and Bambi can't be in shock or thrown off by Erica's actions. C'mon now.
So let me get this straight, spice can call people out their name like bitches and Giraffe and as long it’s not calling her a monkey know one a monkey she gets a pass, get the hell out of here her as should be held accountable just like Erica, it’s sounds racist to me when your identity someone out of their culture, she also a bully, but she gets a pass
Chile, Spice need to leave that show before it ruins her brand, which she worked so hard to build. Yes, LHHATL help revive her career in the U.S., but just like Cardi, you gotta know when to leave that platform.
See how quickly.bam got mad when spice called her fake. Because she is a fake ass biatch. If someone called me fake or names id be so unbothered but maybe thats just me especially when your secure with yourself, secure in your identity no names can hurt you because YOU know its not true. Idk some girls just rub me the wrong way and thats bam and her mean girl frenemies ericahh and sierra 😂😂
Spice is all talk and always want to fight someone but loves to argue!!!😂Lol
But did it have to escalate that much? Why everything has to lead to a physical altercation?
Spice really think she IT. Barney you cannot fight, shut up
i understand why spice is angry and shes right bambi fake af
But her wanting smoke with Bambi just looks messy on her end bc why do u drag her in yall business she wasn't there nor Sierra so what if they friends or co workers yandy asked her a question she was talking to her ... she turned up on a nice island 🏝  like cmon that's just crazy ... spice calling woman botches and fake but girl you almost ed died from a fake butt literally ... humble yourself . Erica was wrong ok that's not to defend her but conung for Bambi ant gonna solve nothing ... yall need to leave Bambi alone she got alot on her plate ....
Dora was doing too much yes Erica was wrong but Erica started off calmly and then Dora started lashing and Bambi was talking calmly and again Dora started going off
1:17 😂😂😂😂 they just following the tea
But Spice was really asking Serria why she so fake? She wasnt asking Bambi. Bambi too nough
Beat her azz Spice! Bamboo and Manlookin Mena are both 💀💀 and Seirra 🐤🐜can get it too!
Are we all forgetting the setting? Not the time or the place Spice should just let it go for the time being. If Bambi pulls a fake card let her, CUZ ITS NOT THE TIME OR THE PLACE TO GET TO THE FACTS.
They all need to grow the hell up and go get anger management help. What erica said was wrong we all make mistakes. Spice is wrong too talking about her son grow the hell up.   I like both ladies but come on your mothers remember that when your mouths start flapping. Praying for u both.
The food must be hitting because they kept eating.
Spices very wrong As mother you should never disrespect another mother.keep kids out of it
I hate Bambi. Sierra is turning into a bird. Spice ain’t wrong. That’s all.
Fired Spice Fired Spice Fired Spice Love of Hip Hop of Atlanta it’s not right she called Bam Bitch over and over again and she called her names and a Giraffe that is not cool
Spice need to be fired to for calling Bam names
Bambi is a liar 😂
SPICE THAT WIG THO....Dem wicked to u auntie so you can call Bambi a giraffe 😮but Erica can't call u a blue monkey 😢😅😅😅😅kmt tyad a unu
Everybody’s eyes are so BIG👀but they keep sippin and eating🫠😂😂
I can’t watch this shit if I tried it makes no sense
I be on spice energy ❤❤❤❤❤❤
First of all Bambi is always playing the fucking victim she doesn't take account ability for nothing she does always blameing the baby father
They're both for them are fake I don't know why spices even trying to explain they're going to keep doing it
Bro Erica is the whole story line of lhh now 😂😂
U not talkin to Bambi but clearly said why YALL so fake? Spice u fake too sis 😂
So did we all forgetting spice wanted to bleach her skin …
All the name calling is degrading period.  This is sad when you can't communicate while offending someone else to get your point across. Everyone is accountable for there own behavior and all of them have a lot of maturing to do.
Handy, it won’t even let me spell her name, yandy lit the fire🔥 I see you 👀 then got quiet🔇 she low key love the drama😏 Erica cancelled herself end of discussion, I mean they should of let spice beat her ass real quick as Ericas send off the L&HH set would been perfect.
Spice wanting the smoke with the FAB’s
Ok if Spice mentioning Erica son was sooooooooo outta pocket...how come Erica didn't  call Stevie Jay or Scrappy Monkeys when they both told her "go take care of ya son" insinuating her "mommy skills" need some work.  This aint the 1st time somebody came dor that girl parenting referencing her son, and it also aint the 1st time she called a blk person a monkey...foh
sorry but unpopular statement why didn't bambi have that energy for erica?
Explosions like these warrant labels like monkey. And it's not racial.
To be honest this season of Love & Hip Hop is bringing out the worst character traits in a lot of these women it's bringing out bad character traits and Bambi spice Erica and even Sierra and I also don't like how they bully and Karlie Redd Karlie Redd may have her issues but so does the rest of these girls just need to use Karlie Redd as a punching bag to deflect from their own issues and problems even Rasheeda it's starting to turn into a mean girl this season of Love & Hip Hop is honestly sickening a lot of these women are hurt not healed from the things that happened to them and they're taking it out on each other and it's very hard to watch as a woman myself where is the women's empowerment women need to stick together and stuff like this but I guess we don't see that this season all these women are going through things even Karlie Redd and no one pulls Karlie Redd aside to see what she's genuinely going through but they're the first to use this girl is a punching bag this is sad😢
Spice just went through a traumatic experience. No one is the same after that. She needs therapy for sure because she hasn’t been the same since. She’s on edge but not wrong. They were gaslighting her pretending to not know. Then Sierra says the things Erica said is wrong? In their confessionals they said they didn’t believe Bambi said it. Plus y’all need to stop.  Mama Dee and Erica Dixon are the first ones to call and label Bambi as A GIRAFFE y’all reaching and a racial slur is a racial slur. Prayers for spice mental health.
Can we all remember that Bambi is also a colorist  So I’m sure she doesn’t care about what Erica said
I don’t like how sierra is blaming SEAfaree for what Erica did and said to Spice
Imagine calling someone a giraffe after being called a blue monkey…but Bambi do look like giraffe tho but still like What 💀💀💀
Omg  i really cant agree with Spice .
All spice said was why they being fake.  They are they are disregarding Erica did and gaslighting spice. Spice doesn’t have to pretend. Erica and Sierra both said they don’t believe Erica said it in their confessionals. #teamspice
Spice out here doing the Lords work🙌
Safaree is not in the picture no more. It's not about him, it's the fat that she called spice a monkey knowing the meaning behind that word. But when the girl wit the orange hair said the same thing she just was rolling her eyes and nice nasty. That's what it is.
Where is mimi
I’m not feeling spice she slick also turning into a bully look how she treated Karlie and she had receipts that Shekinah was lying to shekinah is the opportunist and always instigating
Erica does too much all the time! But because spice gets hype too yall wanna call her out. Hold Erica accountable,  which yall have a problem doing with latina women on Love and hip-hop.
renni is so pretty it’s giving hello kitty
Spice didn't do too much, those girls fake asf like she said. Don't come there trying to clean up Erica's mess by saying she could never , would never say those things. Bambi is giving colorist.
I think spice is over this show all together cause she is being real and they keep producing a show lol 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hate shekainah be walking up to stop spice all the time
A giraffe is not related to anything racial…
Oh my goodness. These are not grown women! These are overgrown teenagers smh!
Spice is out of control.
i think Bambi was telling the truth bc how can erica tell them she called their fellow black girl a "monkey"
Bambi been fake af
Erica is finally receiving all her karma for all the nonsense she’s has put out for years! I feel sorry for her not one bit! 🤷🏽‍♀️ Let her simmer in it and feel every emotion especially the way DJ Envy’s wife felt.. now sip that tea ☕️
Bambi is lying , because ,Sierra says she told Bambi that was some F shit ericka was saying , do you know they all spoke about it !!!
She was wrong for saying that to Spice, but Spice was wrong also talking about her child because some man told her. M
I feel like Spice was projecting her energy towards Erica friends because Erica wasn’t there. I understand what Erica said was wrong but Spice had no right talking about Erica’s son. It’s not cool and the others seem like they scared to tell her she was wrong also. And I just feel like Spice is toxic she act like she don’t want the drama but always interjecting into others affairs like Erica and Safaree’s situation.
Bambi was calm this was unnecessary
Yandy always stirring up the drama and acting like she knows nothing
Bambi weave hair line is not good it's cheap and she don't send out purchases Bambi CAP
Spice doing a little too much now. Pipe down now. She need to be fired too. How you gonna tell Erica to leave her out of stuff with Safari then want to include people in her dealings with Erica.
Team Spice. Queen Spice❤❤🎉
I honestly don’t think Erica told them what she really said..
Spice doing too much she need go on somewhere fr #ANNOYING
I think I speak for all when I say SPICE SIT DOWN!!! BAMBIE DIDN’T DO SHIT TO YOU!!! EVER NOTICE SPICE IS ALWAYS IN A FIGHT WITH SOMEONE?!? PSSHHHTTT GO GET HAPPY BITCH!!!
What season is this? I want to stream it
Spice look a mess
What kind of surgery every keep saying spice had
Spice is starting to act like a bully.
Stop it Spice
Girl you just had a surgery... Relax..
When spice makes that face, looks and tilts her head down to the side, it’s clear sign that she doesn’t wanna where’s at anymore.
Spice is not one to play with at this point 😅
Spice definitely be on some bs when them cameras come on. She do to much and she’s making herself look like the bully smh
I didn’t know y’all could be this dumb. 1) Giraffe isn’t racially motivated. 2)Clearly Spice feels as though Bambi is being fake because her of the altercation between spice and her ‘ bestfriend ’. 3) Bambi is moving as if she doesn’t believe Erica didn’t call Spice a monkey. 4) Spice also wasn’t talking about Erica’s kids. Her point was, Erica was comparing their parenting but to contrast, Spice said that Erica’s son doesn’t even like her (which is the difference between them two. Spice just seems over the bs and she’s not passive about it. There’s no way Bambi couldn’t have heard what had happened and not a reason why she should be questioning the validity of Erica’s racist remarks.
Spice just over the high school bs. I'm here for it, check them ooos
I don’t care for Bambi, but Spice shouldn’t have reacted like that towards her and especially call her B.I.T.C.H. was not necessary. She took that out on her because that’s her friend. Just disassociate yourself from them, but the reaction was real out of order.
At this point cancel Spice too I’m over her victim head azz too
I hated that Tamar backtracking cause she had it right
I'm team Erica on this one. Spice went too low. Such wicked comment deserves a wicked response. why kick a person when they're down? Safaree is the catalyst for all these troubles. master manipulator.
😂😂😂 shekinah said “you just got the key to the region”
I'm very confused when did Racism become OK.....there is no excuse for what she said, she insulted all Black people globally!!
This is why Spice will never have my support… She does wayyy too much…she wants respect but doesn’t give it
Spice does way too much sometimes shes gonna jump up in somebody face and they are going to give it to her. Whether they have talked to their "friend" or not what went on with you and her has nothing to do with them. Spice always jumping up trying to fight.
Wasn't feeling Spice her first season and she a Leo... Stop trying us FRFR. Most Leos POP. DONT COME FOR ME.  Edit: meant to add that i love and understand her now. She just don't got time. And stop mistaking a person being mad at you because they checked you.
They all still eating 😂
Shekinah’s face when spice said “ why ya always so faaaake ! “ 😯
If we watch what Spice's mouth was saying to Bambi, we know she's cussing at her, acting tough.  While Bambi was doing her best to hold back.  It's obvious who values "friendship" here.  #Bambi
No amount of money couldn’t let me go on the net to play a fool… spice a dis yuh come a farrin fah mumma!? Spice you a come off as toxic now
Erica called spice a Blue Monkey but I know I heard Spice call Bambi a giraffe oh wow
1:18  That blue-haired girl looks like a Simiiformes with a blue wig on.
Yall noticed initially they said they havent talked to her about her racial slur & then all of a sudden,  they told Erica she was wrong for what she said. That's being fake, a liar & defending a racist women by blaming Safari when he had absolutely nothing to do with it. Bambi & Sierra stay looking a hot @$$ mess!!!
Spice was out of line. That was not the way to approach Bambi if she had questions about her conversation with em. Remember that is not who flipped a table on you.
Spice urky now
Spice needs to go back to Jamaica
I'm tired of spice .. I'm not watching this show anymore. ...
Erica said what she said and we all hear it very clear in england too ERICA U more wrong
Spice a bully .
Love me some Spice, she is the realest. PERIOD
Spice neeed to go
Spice has been acting up these days... Maybe it's the Grammy nominees I don't know, but it's not a good look.
Spice need to sit down before someone kick her in her botched Hernia! She already rotten in the inside thanks to her surgeon
Spice. If there was ever a person who allowed fame and success to change every fiber of their being, it's definitely homegirl. She changed after dating ol boy from production, got that Grammy nom, and then her brush with the other side. She used to be so cool and calm. Sweet and chill. Some people. Fame is one hell of a drug!  She is over!
https://youtu.be/qjtKgndXmb8?si=rzEtePS3aThE5JZ_ Evelyn call OG monkey and nothing be done about it.
Shakinah is giving me thirsty…she always putting herself in someone else’s drama. Always trying to be apart of something. Get ya own business! Clout Chasing
Spice think she so much better then everyone. Big billy.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Spice is a bully it doesn't matter if bambi talk to erica so what
This whole season spice has been going off on any and everyone like she needs to calm down frfr she doing way too much ….
Spice is upset that THESE BLACK WOMEN are not defending her and trying to protect ERICA. Erica not these bitches friends cause she would have never said no s**t like that. Sierra was smart she removed herself hopefully Bambi will too
These women are so immature it's not even funny anymore! Spice keeps relishing her victim act and Bambi continues to play both sides.
They keep saying black monkey, she said blue monkey 🤦🏽‍♀️. Erica is wrong as hell and spice is working a nerve being a bully the whole season. Hanging out with shekinah is not a good look for her.
Dumb comments,these people must not be brown skinned or dark skinned,
Yandy and mendeecee
Space need to get her life together. She’s running around starting mess for no good reason
Team spice
I’m Renni chewing hard as ever and watching!! 🤣🤣
Here the anti Black people in the comments go saying a Black woman upset about being called a racial slur, being physically attacked and wished death upon by racist trash is an "Angry Black woman"🙄  They always want Black people to be calm and forgiving when we are viciously attacked with racial hate.  ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!!  Spice has every right to go off on these 2 no self respect having Black women for coddling a racist and lying about not knowing what happened!
Cancel the show all these women are toxic and have no respect for each other
Cancel the show all these women are toxic and have no respect for each other
Spice is raggedy af and low down but Erica is unlikable and has a bad reputation and a stank ass attitude. So, naturally people are going to take Erica’s side.
Now alllll of a sudden they havent spoken. How convenient. I agree with spice.
Spice is too good for this show!
SPICE needs to shut up!!!
Letsssssss Taŵwwwwwk
Sierra was right 😂
Spice woulld crush bam
Bambi, Sierra, and Erica been mean girls all season, spice is gathering all of them. I used to not like Spice but I really like her this season because she putting them in there in place. Erica and Sierra were wrong for ganging up on scrappy, Sierra was wrong for mentioning diamond who was probably just minding her business, and Bambi was wrong for talking about Erica.
So Erica gets fired for saying monkey but spice can call Bambi a giraffe
Aren't they all fake
All I can think of is Rah saying Yandy throws stones, then hides her hands. Yandy instigated this so effortlessly lmao.
Looking the way she does now Erica should be the last person to call someone outta their name 🤢
What I don't understand is that someone can be kicked off for saying monkey but the rest of these people can't for their actions. Throwing drinks in someone's face can lead to eye poisoning. Love and Hip Hop promotes assault about on every situation. But a word can kick someone off. They call each other Bs and Ns but no one saying nothing about that.
I don’t like spice she think she some kind of African queen somebody need to whoop ha ass she talk too much
Spice crazy i am not a fan anymore she is very disrespectful they didnt have nothin to do with it you basically mad cuz she said she aint talk to the girl so what
No seriously why y’all hate Bambi so much? Me personally I love her
But hold on....why is it ok for Spice to call Bambi a Giraffe? What happen?
Stop lying Bambi. There's no way she didn't know what happened. Erica may not have been honest about what she said but she definitely spoke to Bambi.
Spice is so messy
That was Sierra moment to stand up for whats wrong because the truth IS Erica threw Sierra under the bus to take the attention off of her. 🤔
What y’all need to worry about is how y’all degrade each other worse than that on a daily basis. If it was anyone else other than Erica saying it to Spice, y’all would be mute. So cut the selective outrage.
Of course they use this entire scene to make Spice appear crazy. 🙄 Lots of cut-outs.
Theae is some loyal ass friends...both divorced, both single...shit they all divorced lol but  all in somebody else business..couldn't even save yall own relationship but all up in somebody else's
So you was talking to Bambi lol
Spice wrote a song called GOD A BLESS ME she is too talented for this. Mama get out of there. You’re a step above this mess. No disrespect.
Honestly I am NOT happy with Spice this season.  She has been combative and just FULL of herself.  It's not a good look and they need ro stop coddling her because of what happened to her. It does not excuse her behavior AT ALL! I'm over her!
Karlie is in the corner, minding her business .
Yes spice call that liar out
Spice's ego is out of control. Even if Erika DID talk to bambi, why does bambi need to deliver their business to an entire table?? If she doesnt want to talk about it then she doesnt. Spice would do the same if she wanted to keep something under wraps. Not to mention Erika isnt even there, so why would they NEED to speak on a situation revolving around her without her even there bruh Spice tries way too hard. I liked her a lot at the beginning but she really needs to humble herself and stop OVER ESCALATING situations to such an extreme then call other people fake extra girl bye
Spice needs her ass beat she acts as if she can have her way and get madd at the same time no one remembers when she racialized Tokyo about her weight. I'm over spice . Bambi should have put them paws on her ass.
SPICE DID TOOOO MUCH HERE!!!!! idc what anyone says. Bambi don't owe spice nothing. They both aint heard from erica after finding out what she called spice. Spice taking it out on them for nothing. Calling them fake but then saying she wasn't talking to bambi is fake ass hell. Calling bambi an animal after she's mad at erica for calling her an animal is hypocritical and insane.
Erica didn’t call her a “black monkey” she called her a “blue monkey” and Spice called her a “bitch” which is a female dog. They both called each other an animal. Why is it okay for women to call each other a dog but pull the race card when another animal name is called. She didn’t say it to be racist, I get it that people took it that way. But the fact Spice is lying saying she called her a black monkey is wrong. She was referring to Spice blue fettish, everything Spice wears is BLUE and she called her a blue monkey. Folks gotta stop it, especially Spice.
renni 😂😂😂😂
I wouldn't expect Bambi to discuss her conversation with Erica to Spice. Don't remember Bambi and Spice being friends. Why did Spice go there with Bambi by calling her a giraffe? Yes Bambi isn't perfectly symmetrical in the face but she's far prettier than Spice IMO. It was unnecessary to bring up looks. She'd feel Bambi was wrong if she did the same to her.
Guck spice bring Jessica dime back so she can check spice mf ass
BAMBI IS NOT GOING TO BE SPICE FLYING MONKEY LIKE THE REST OF THEM UNTIL SHE FIND OUT FROM ERIKA WHATS GOING ON IN HER HEAD. SPICE BE MAD BY YOURSELF. That's HER best friend not yours narcissist just becus youll discard yours to please other ppl for clout and favor. Girl bye.
To whoever needs to hear this, I love you My black sisters ❤️  Spice that was wrong of Erica! Seeing your past seasons express the colorists issues and then this! Absolutely not! I'm standing by you sis or I stand for nothing! Spice I did actually pray for you when you were sick, as I do for everyone who needs prayers! I solemnly swear to always honor my black women and men with All my heart and soul! I love you and we are Not alone! God always has the 1st and last word! Amen I love all ethnicities as God does! I love you all but the racist ones but I will keep you in prayer! Spice , stay strong my love, your going places others Can't go with you! Trust in God when he removes those in your life that mean you No good! Amen ❤ 1 love 1 unity ❤❤
#teamericaaaa
She start everything then get your feelings hurt then play victim now everybody see it was you not Erica she needs to be disciplined they don’t have to like you fam lol blue head she starts all the drama Erica is black she Puerto Rican an Dominican and black 😂
Wait did spice just call Bambi a giraffe !? Lol
Spice literally said/asked “why YALL so fake” then screams at Bambi “I wasn’t tlking to you” 😂 girlll you said YALLL !!!! make it make sense why wouldn’t bambi say something if yu said YALL buh heyyy tooo each their own issues 😭
Remember when Spice would get mad because Toyoko called her a bitch? Now she calling everyone a bitch!!! Spice worried about being called a money? She better be glad she didn't get them hands for pulling that pussy move by talking  about that girl child!! Everyone on Spice side but yall knowing that would have been yall kid, it probably would have been worse!! They both was wrong!!!
Bambi always escalated things then play victim!
Spice needs to leave this show. She always says she doesn’t want a bad rep, this show will do just that!
Old hoes arguing is the basic plot of LHH
I kinda wish Spice would have had this same energy for the individual who called her a racial slur. It almost seems as if she has a issue with Afro American women only.
I really can't stand Spice at this point.  She causes a lot of drama, then cries victim.  Erica was wrong but Bambi and Sierra didn't say it, so they don't have to answer for her or stop being her friend if they don't want to.  Spice didn't get her surgery having a** up to fight Erica, so she should have several seats now.  How the hell you mad about being called an animal then turn around and call someone else one.  Also, if Yandy is curious to know why Erica said what she said and how she feels afterward, she should take that up with Erica.
Spice is angry and has a hostile demeanor. Don’t get me wrong I can’t stand Bambi nor Sierra, but Spice directing her anger towards them and they aren’t the ones that did anything. You could tell they didn’t even want to get into it with Spice. She created a problem where there is no problem and I can’t stand how she treats Shekinah! I know she can be loud and  obnoxious, but she throws a lot of unnecessary slugs at her. It seems like everybody kissing Spice ass this season! I can’t stand her!
Spice get away from that blue hair it looks a mess 😂
Spice pregnant 🤔
Spice is a shit starter and is only getting a guilt pass because she is dark skin.
I am Jamaican and I'm a part of the industry as I'm a DJ. I must say that I'm disappointed in how Spice conducts herself on this show as this show is her opportunity. Spice is NOT RECOGNIZED as an artiste in Jamaica. In fact, she had been ignored by the Jamaican people (except for the ones who are similar to her in character) and the mainstream artistes and others that make up the industry. On her first season of LHH, Tokyo asked a valid question, "Who are you & what's your music because we don't know you." Spice was offended by this. It was not until VH1 at the time gave her an opportunity to be a cast member. That was and has been her first opportunity of a mainstream platform. It was because of this platform that she made contact with Shaggy and started winning 'awards'. She NEVER had anything that could play on the radio or in most places because she is not considered a real artiste as she is not creative but she is "loose of tongue". This therefore means that she will say and do anything in order to make money AND she is a BULLY! You see for yourselves on this show how she treats the other cast members. How she tries hard to be in Rasheeda & Kirk's good graces. How mean she has been to Karlie Redd for no reason and of course, you saw how pushy she was towards Tamar Braxton that this Braxton girl could not hold her true opinion.  Saying this, to say that Viacom has single-handedly created this monster. She had long been ignored by the Jamaica people because:  1). She lacks talent 2). She is vulgar, wild, a loose cannon and  3). She hates when she's in a room and not noticed & LOVES to validate herself  Jamaican people do not dislike Spice because she is black as she has said on the show. She is treated how she's treated because of her poor attitude. You'll all recognize this soon. To the situation with her and Erica Mena. Spice is the instigator as Erica did not try to argue with her. Spice's main issue with Erica is because she never expressed remorse for her while she was ill. Contrary to the story line on the show, her illness is self-inflicted as she wanted to 'fix' her body. Erica is wrong to say what she did. However, Erica is a victim herself and any woman would feel bad being pregnant and ignored by their child's father while he sheds tears for someone else who made their own self sick. Spice is the one who instigated the argument and should be kicked off the show as well. In Jamaica, although we are mostly black people, when we're upset we'll tell people that they're "black & ugly" or "ugly like monkey". Other Jamaicans (not Spice's minions) can attest that we say this. Spice also places an outcast you-tuber by the name of 'Pretti Don' to argue with people if they mention her name. It is a known fact that she pays Pretti Don to do this. This is just a tip of the iceberg of who this character is. MTV needs to thoroughly do their research and stop assisting this person to scandalize Jamaica's good reputation and standards. Think about it, if she was a Jamaican artiste would she be on the show and why? How is what she does reflective of American music and culture?
The comment was wrong but spice can’t tell Somebody what they heard cuz she mad, if nothing was said yet nothing was said
Ya this was not cool it too much
spice out yeah showing these girls for their true colours because they really fake. bambi been fake. after what did they to sierra playing like they didn’t know about the “safari wanting sierra” situation after they all spoke about it and said they won’t go in the show about it… yeah they been showing their colours. CALL THEM OUT SPICE!!!!
Spice plays victim too much for me!  Every season, it's the same thing with her. Then she wants to buck up at the same time.
I’m sorry but what is spice even doing on this show every clip I see she’s trying to fight someone
Looking good
Spice be getting in my nerves someone needs to put her in check bc she thinks she’s so superior then the rest if the cast
Bambi know Danm well she spoke to Erica 😏
I only clicked because Spice was on the thumbnail. I don't watch this mess.
I’m sick of Spice @ this point🙄
Spice needs to sit her big ass down starting all the drama mad because they are still friends with Erica...spice was wrong you dont bring up no ones kids when yours just moved her a year ago she picking and pointing still as a new bitch coming in and she can still get this work period
I didn’t care for Spice since when she was body shaming that girl over a man. I don’t care if they made up or not. That’s just who Spice is so I can say I don’t care for her.  The problem is she calls everyone else out like her stuff doesn’t stink. Me, how I am. If it’s fake ppl around. I’m not going no where around them. If I have to work with them, no conversation needed unless it’s about the job.   Like I said before it’s free game once you speak about my parenting and/or kids. You already did damage. So why should I protect your feelings after. Black ppl can’t stick to the topic at hand, without insulting and hitting below the belt.   Last week my co worker (a black man) who I’m cool with. He wanted to talk outside, I wasn’t in the mood and tired. He said “Oh you don’t want to talk to me. Well I don’t want to talk to your monkey ass anyway.” Trying to make a joke out it, but said it twice. I immediately got offended. We don’t, and never had joked in that way. To be comfortable enough to call me a monkey, I was shocked. He apologized because he seen how upset I got. But the thing is. Why when another black person say it, it’s fine long as another race not saying it?   Black ppl just need to stop doing, and saying certain things to each other. That you wouldn’t want another race group to say to us. Lead by fucking example. The same with “Nigga”. JUST STOP.
In spice’s defense I would find it hard to believe that Bambi didn’t know what went down
So it’s ok for spice to do the name calling lol
That was a very strange interaction.. sounds like  “I know what I said was wrong but out of loyalty to me, you’re my friend so don’t speak on it” Then Bambi getting mad was just to deflect.
Yandy is messy😳…yet, while the conversation is going back&forth(that she started🤯)her & Mendeecee sit quietly looking like they’re watching a tennis match🥱
I look at spice in a different way now!!!
I think Spice just wanted them to drop the TV bull for a second but they both got pretty defensive. Bambi knows shes talked to Erica & Spice knows she's tripping right now.  Pointless
Spice, Bambi, Safari...wtf?
Yandy & Mendeecees looking back & forth like they watching a tennis match 🤣🤣Spice said "Erica's son didn't like her", which she should not have said,. If someone had said that to Spice, she would have snapped right away!!  What she said, however, didn't warrant Erica calling her what she did. Let's not forget, this is not Erica's first time being slick with her mouth & using racial slurs. Spice was right to question Bambi & Sierra, they're her "friends" & as her "friends" & both being of dark skin tone, she would have to explain to me exactly what she said & why she thought it was appropriate. Bambi said "we talked, but didn't talk about that." Whaaat?? First thing out my mouth would have been "BITCH (cuz they talk like that to each other) what you call Spice???  NOW they entire staff hearing about it & they're feeling a way because most of the cast is of darker skin tone & yeah they have a right to feel that way.  Kirk summed it up. Khaotic asked "who she say that about?" Kirk said "you & all of us!"
Spice is doing too much fr
Y'all black American women running to Spice defensive when she talks down on black American women and make sure to differentiate her self screaming Jamaican this Jamaican that
Renni just sitting there eating is ME 😂and 😂
Why mendeecee wife always trying to be a narrator
I didn't take it racial people will say anything once you disrespect their kids
The directors and management  on some bs .
THEY DON'T KNOW ❓ YANDY HOLDS SEVERAL TITLES.  HUMANITARIAN ACTIVIST 💯
I’m here for spice man fck erica, bambi, and whoever else tryna stand up for her. Erica is waayyy off.
Honestly, they need all the cast to do a check yourself to watch the Erica and spice fight so we can see how they all react!
Spice so comfortable calling people bitch now but was offended being called tht a few seasons ago
I remember when spice first came of lhh and she was "DONT CALL ME A BITCH I DONT LIKE THE WORD BITCH" but now she calling every body a bitch
I hope Erica cut them off they both did not defend her spice was wrong she came after her child simple !!!
LHH ATL needs to be put on "Pause" because its not even entertaining anymore. It lost its spark over the last several seasons. They need to recast big-time. 90% of the current cast needs to go. LHH ATL hasnt really ever made any artist go big and mainstream outside of K-michelle and maybe Spice. Outside of that its nothing but a bunch of wannabe , has-beens, and never was on the show. ATL was entertaining because of orginal characters and the cast not music. Now its boring and too dark and negative.  Unpopular opinion but bring back LHH NY music wise was the best franchise and overall had a good cast minus the last couple of seasons.
Why is Bambi even on there? She don’t do none but mess with rich men😊
But when she called Tokyo fat it wasn’t this same energy.
Renni Rucci was eating her food like popcorn lol 😅
The way yandy and mandeece had me rolling cause they so In sync it’s hilarious
Team spice all the way 💙💙💙
Spice really thought we was gon stand by her on this one 😒
Spice just called Bambi a giraffe smh...
I don't care spice be doing to much u not about to be talking to be side ways and she has selective hearing they don't have to tell u what they spoke with erica about spice just wants everybody to cancel erica and stop being friends with her not gone happen yes erica was wrong but spice was coming for blood when she sat down with erica her plan was to do the most and she got exactly what she wanted they be doing to much
Spice has a lot of class and has every right to be upset after the woman is lying in her face and Erica said such disgusting offensive things. Spice big up yourself, you’re a queen amongst peasants.
I understand everything and I agree that the racial slur is out of this world. But the argument at hand in this video is because Bambi said who the. f are you talking to, after Spice said, why are YALL so fake. So I don't understand why Spice was trying to say she was talking to Sierra and not Babi. Y'all is multiple people.
I LIKE SPICE DATS RITE CALLEM OUT ON DAT BULLONEY
Did Spice call bambi a giraffe  at 1.30 she says I dont see a giraffe??? 👀👀👀
Spice is Leo and Erica is Scorpio, the Leo might win this. They are much better at manipulating than the Scorpio. They both have never liked each. They have been playing cat and mouse, waiting to see who would show their ass first.
And if it’s my friend and she already got her back against the wall NO I haven’t Hurd shit because soon as she say one wrong thing it can all flip on her !! No bitch I haven’t talked to her and who gone check me
Spice is annoying. Is it all about her ?
She don’t wanna b called a BLUE monkey but callin Bambi a giraffe 🦒 my point if u go low ima go lower!! She can ride the race card but she kno that girl didn’t mean it like that !! If it looks like a 🙈 act like a 🙉 it’s a 🙊 not matter the race
I’m not really a big fan of Bambi but she obviously didn’t really want to talk about the situation, that gives spice no right to be going off calling her bitches and what not. Spice always does too much.
SPICE IS ALL OVER THE PLACE WHY IS SHE SO HOSTILE AND MAD.
Come thru spice , she checking they ass ,
Rasheeda Kirk yandy mendecee I like them but they need to go need some new blood foreaL
Iont non ovem nomore this cast need a shack up foreal
I agree with spice
so did they talk? or did they fight? 😭
Once upon a time not long ago, spice said dont call her a b***h but she called bambii a whole lot if them🙄
The best reality show on tv period❤❤
Spice was doing wayyy too much
Spice is a mess loud and obnoxious
I wonder what she would do when she meets Erica, acting like the boss I don't support Erica but spice is acting as if she can beat everyone
I'm sorry but Spice and Erica was wrong ..... But right here Spice is wrong AF, why would I discuss to y'all what me and my BFF talked about..... No ma'am Nope we didn't talk, nope, nope, bitch nope.....
Yes was it wrong. But not one person is saying how Spice said on many occasions about that girl son. Some mess as Sierra said Safaree spreading. Dang i hate Erica took him back.
Let’s replace Yandy and get our Mimi back cause idk why she even a main cast could’ve just been a Recurring fr
Bambi lied about being 4 years younger she is a LIARRR
It is funny Spice don't like to be call a bitch but she call Bambi a bitch and 🦒 then play victim we are over Spice
Im getting tiref of spice behavior for real...now she's doing to much ..get over urself
Spice is a bully.I don't know why y'all can't see it.
Spice is a bully.I don't know why y'all can't see it.
Spice cane on this show and stole it. I'm here for it. She could be going places alot faster  if she got away from this embarrassing franchise. She made her mark time to go to the next level.
Spice needs to start to rep Jamaica better,  all this craziness is embarrassing.
How y’all gonna tell these people what they talked about 😂😂. She said she spoke to her but what she said never came up. Cici told her what was said later. She said once Erika gets time they’re I’ll have a full conversation.
Yes!!! Safaree started the whole thing he should not have said anything to spice about Erica's kids
Bambi know good and well she talked to Erica about what happened. She was just trying to protect her, "Friend" Then, like she just making it seem like, its okay for Erica to say what she said to Spice. It wasn't cool at ALL! Her as a black woman should know that!
If I heard another race say something racist I would’ve mop her
Love spice 😍 😋 💕 ❤️
Spice pops off a little too much for me. Now, you're going in on Bambi and Sierra. Calm tf down Spice.
Spice how you mad at Sierra and Bambi they didn't do shit to u check Erica I'm tired of Spice she quick to call some one a bitch which is a female dog but u mad cause u got called a monkey 😂girllllll
Good video
Oh that’s right Karen aka Erica wished death as well on Spice like she really sat down and talked negatively about her son that she said herself don’t like her ass as well as many many black men and other women but what she is really mad about Safaree picking his Darker Skin tone over his PREFERENCE AND THAT’s what’s killing Erica I mean KAREN SHE WAS FINE WHEN SHE FELT A ONE UP ON OUR WOMEN BUT WHEN Safaree brought Amina dark kids them watches and then he showed he cared about the second darkest women being sick and prayed for Spice health that piss KAREN OFF. In here mind she was like I dare him do this to me on national tv with them 2 black women over me
I'm not a fan of Bambi but all that energy directed at her was too much. Yeah, I get she mad at Erica but keep it there with Erica. Spice wanna hold friends guilty by association than she better look back to last season. Wasn't Spice friends with the girl Jocs wife didnt like? Imagine if they came at Spice like that about her friend.
Spice is doing too much!! She needs to calm down to old for this drama
Spice is doing too much.
They got Spice saying bitch lol
I’m not checking my friend in front of nb , regardless of the situation. I would’ve called her line immediately, but tryna get me to go against my friend cus of what y’all said .. no .. imma get ts figured out and not in front of nb … I get Bambi tf .. you saw that sierra and Bambi was taken back by it
Besides the comment being made , why is Spice steady saying “y’all” but every time Bambi says something , she goes “who you talking to” & “ I don’t see her”💁🏽 . She literally inserted a back & forth when Bambi first started speaking .
Spice needs to calm down. Why do you care if they spoke to her or not? Calling someone out their name is just as disrespectful. You can’t keep getting crazy and expect people not to hate you
So spice can call Bambi a giraffe and that’s cool y’all love to pick and choose who can say and do what
Jess didn’t like when that Trans said she look’s like a man so she really needs to take a step back into reality and stop being fake. Spice did not talk about that girl son Spice did not call her son a bad name, they were talking about their parenting and she ain’t say nothing no one else sitting around in her face have said to her on several occasions that even Erica her self have said that her own SON DON’T LIKE HER ASS, And for black women that has this light skin and white tone worship in them to take up for a chic that really don’t like y’all black ass’s but only tolerate being around y’all too use your ass to be around you too get our community men and when they do you are nothing but what she called Spice in her eyes, and here go’s the community men who take up for their PREFERENCES OF WOMEN THAT LOOKS LIKE ERICA READY TO GO TO WAR ON THE SAME WOMEN THAT BORN YOUR ASS THAT STOOD BY YOUR SLOW ASS SIDES AFTER AND BEFORE THEY REALIZE THEY HAVE THE SAME TYPE OF MAN WE HAD ALL ALONG AND THAT THEY WASN’T NO MORE SPECIAL THAN US BLACK WOMEN  But we must be very special for every light tone of women that has to have at least a few of us as a friend to learn how to dance, to learn how to dress, to learn how to speak we can not help that we have this unique PRESENCE ABOUT US THAT DRAW’S LIGHTER TONE COMMUNITY TO US BLACK WOMEN. We SO HOOD AND GHETTO BUT THEY CAN NOT STAY THEIR ASS AWAY FROM US WHERE SUCH MONKEYS THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN BY OUR MONKEY LOOKING ASS’S. Love & HIP HOP NEEDS TO BE BAND AND THE REST OF THE SHOWS LIKE THAT THAT MAKES OUR PEOPLE LOOK BAD AND BE CALLED INHUMAN NAME’S ERICA IS A KAREN IN MY EYE’S and forever and we have black Karen’s as well that stood up for her.
To hell with spice she makes me so damn sick
Even if they didn't feel offended by what she said they don't have the guts to say it or the will be black balls as well me personally as a black woman I take no offense to what she said to spice and honestly I think she deserves it don't bring up my fucking kid she's lucky she didn't say more .once you talk about my kid everything is off limits like what the fuck do you think this is. You touch my chest like that so I'm gonna touch it just like this so we both are feeling the same way fair spice throwing rocks and hide her hands
The way they turned their heads in unison was crazy like kids watching adults fight
spice needs to be fire she always trying to fight some one.  b sit down
spice is looser n you not real mother she dont even raised her own kids.  spice going to jump up one time n she going
Spice is so RIGHT ! Bambi is full of crap, I know the first thing Erica did was call her about the incident with Spice. Also... once you heard that a so called friend of yours said something so negative as a racist remark... you did not speak to her? STOP, either you are stupid or just real desperate for friends. As a woman of color, she should have been highly insulted hearing that came out the mouth of someone she called a friend.
They better leave Spice Alone
BAMBI DOES NOT OWE SPICE NO TYPE EXPLANATION IF SHE SPOKE WITH HER BESTIE ‼️ TF
Reason number 97532357890087445799998€¥*+><=%*$&@“!?.’901457742974225790008653212 Why I don’t want or have FRIENDS. Too messy. I’ll stick to being cordial like hello, goodbye and going my way
Mimi is the most adult mature out of the lot of the cast through the years she carry’s herself rite she ain’t got time for pettiness
I’m sorry but why did spice need to say that sorry but why get into peoples business why do u care who spoke to who… when ur a true grown ass woman u won’t have time for all the trashy talk…. I normally like spice but she just down graded mate
Bambi have the nerve to ask Spice why she's angry...lol...Is she delussional?
Spice: "Ya'll always find a reason to blame it on somebody else except for ya damn SELF!"  PREEEEEEACCHHHHHHH
Spice is a hypocrite because she was body shaming Tokyo in the past and stuff and now shes so mad because people don't want to get involved in the drama that she has going on with Erica.
Spice BYE the queen of Lameness trying anyone cause she knows her music check is sinking….. by love and hip hop Atlanta y’all are done ;)
Spice needs to slow down and grow up.She ain't that interesting to watch anymore 🙄 all she wants is to fight everyone so as to keep relevance to the show but truth is she has no story line😏
Spice ready to pounce on somebody ass!   They was smart to put her at the very end of the table because her ass will jump 😂
Bambi living up to her name lol ,her life in danger but she still going 😂😂😂😂😂
Let's wrap this up.
Yall quick to say spice wrong for saying erica son hate her but yall do the same thing everyday when yall get on the internet bashing men for not being present in their childrens lives or why their children dont like them. Yall love to take up for deadbeat mothers who favor certain children over the other but dont have the same ebergy when its a man in the same situation. I dont think spice was wrong at all. She told erica exactly what she needed to hear. Stop crying and cutting up over safaree so called not being a good father( which isnt true) because these are not your first children, eric has already been through this with her first bd so this should be like clock work to her. Erica doesnt take time with her first born while she hollering about the other two children and getting in her friends relationships, she needs to be working on repairing her relationship with her first son! PERIOD!!! SPICE DIDNT SAY ANYTHING MEAN ABOUT HER SON, SHE CALLED ERICA OUT ON HER BAD PARENTING!!! WHICH SHE CAN DO BECAUSE SHE IS A MOTHER OF TWO AS WELL!  And for yall saying spice didnt have her kids, chile please its a big difference between not having your children around because youre at work vs. Just not being present in their lives and your children hate you. Spice kids love her and spice alwaya mentions both of her, wh have seen her children on ths show multiple times and just in general. Spice is always present in her childrens lives whether in person or through other forms of communication. I assume those who are taking up for Erica have issues with their own children! Cause truth be told Erica was really mad at spice because safaree cried when spice was in the hospital and she thought spice and safaree had something going on! PERIOD!!! Yall forget how erica talked about that woman on love and hiphop who eanted children but couldn't have them or her man didnt want any with her but yall wont acknowledge that! Or how erica had an affair with a married man for 2 years and trolled his wife about it but yall forgot that too huh?!
Whyte women say worse things with jamican people never stand up against racial slurs now they wanna be social warrior????
This is  the thing spice can smell liars ,fake people  an that's on God .
This is truly sad .They both was wrong period when you  fighting with someone you do and say things that hurt so they both to blame shit they both messy as fuck and she called her a blue monkey not black  and you shouldn't start shit if not ready for the after effect
Mena was DEAD wrong, no question. But how does Spice get a pass calling Bambi a Giraffe? I get the "black monkey" racial slur, but how about not referrencing black people as animals period.
Spice is aggressive for no reason she came at Tokyo , she came at Erica and now she’s coming at Bambi it don’t make any sense at this point she is very problematic yes what Erica said was wrong but spice is always aggressive for no apparent reason
Spice look like Bam Bam from the Flintstones in that blue wige
They need to trash this show. All it teaches people is to act like animals without having an adult conversation. Black women are always hollering to respect them . But look what's on TV . They don't even respect each other . Toxic is a trend but class last forever.
classy
See Spice need to chill but everyone kissing Spice ass hope someone needs to bust Spice ass Spice really think she can’t get her ass rock please somebody rock Spice
I didnt think it was fair the way spice went off at bambi.  You can't force them to take your side just allow them
I’m bout getting tired of Spice she getting a little above herself career going to her head and so is her friends butt kissing. You don’t have your kids and they be on tv crying for you, yet you let them get back on the plane to Jamaica . While you out here living your best life. And before people say she trying to provide for her kids hmmmm provide for them in America where you are. But anywho I’m not mad at Erica I’ve heard and been called worse. Spice just think she’s a queen now. But unlike Rasheeda, Yandy, and She-kinda I’m not bowing down.
Spice want sympathy but baby she is nasty acting.
If Mena had to go so does spice .
Spice is the problem
😮 spice called Bambi a b&tch? Usually she don’t like this word when somebody call her a b…
Okay.... it's not like Erica just threw a regular insult..she literally called Spice a "Blue Monkey" and made actual monkey noises... that's beyond reprehensible. ESPECIALLY, when Erica's children are half Jamaican...you can't make this shit up.
Bambi really feel she is a gangsta 🤣🤣
Bambi and Cierra annoying dam Erica a grown ass woman they stay n her business
Spice  you remember  when you call Tokyo  fat💁🏿‍♀️
Team Bambi
Naw Wtf the whole world talking bout that and you ain't talk to the Forehead at the front of the issue? They lie as they hair and nails fake 🙄 Spice season they Beef to blood clott😅😅😅😅
how spice gone start something and then get mad when somebody get offended
Spice is clearly taking out her anger on the wrong people. Tf do they got to do with what Erica said just cuz they’re friends with her? But yet spice loves her some safaree and that’s Erica’s baby daddy? Make it make sense.
Fan 😂😂
You don't call a BLACK PERSON A MONKEY EVER PERIOD AND SHE DONT DO SHYT FOR HER SON OR HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM. I SAID IT NOW CALL ME A MONKEY
Spice is so annoying bruh and stop calling Spice Black. She’s not. She’s Jamaican.   Those who get it, get it. Those who don’t, God bless
Spice is gross
Now Spice be the first one to  check people about her a b**** but all she was saying was b**** to them🤷🏽‍♀️🤣🤣
I'm starting to love Spice more and more. Definitely my alter ego.
Yea Bambi be being fake. Shimmer shimmer motherfucker 😂😂😂 I love me some spice. The realest love and hip hop cast member of all time
Only dumb ppl missed the point spice Is calling out the fake mess
Spice ain’t playing with em
Spice is becoming a bully it's disgusting. She should save that energy for Erica if she has beef with Erica. If my friend is beefing with somebody else that's their whole business I have my own life and my own stuff to deal with period!
Spice is being nit picky AF right now.
Ya madd annoying like spice brought up Erica son. Ya forgot erica been crying shes a single mom of 2. Spice just reminded her nooo you a mother of 3 lol
I kinda feel both side tho but im more wit spice because f i heard my friend say that o hell no im calling my friend right there soon as spice told me that shit
Its shekinah telling spice to sit the fuck down u got the keys to the region 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I understand why she mad but she taking her anger out on Bambi cuz she can't get to Erica that's wrong she needs to refocus that energy spices fake to me she's always fake she somebody friend and she not she felt big headed because of the accomplishments which quickly go under way when you see her still on this show doing the same stuff I don't know but I feel like her goofy ass means stop disrespecting people because they was having a regular conversation now she be upset of somebody called off and called her the b word it's just too much she was talking to Bambi they just coming for band because she in a bad place I feel like spice is just salty that's her spice
Those colored wigs remind me of when I would go to the circus and the funny clowns would greet us before being seated.those were the days.
Am a black woman and wouldn’t take this insult likely but let’s be real and honest Spice is so wrong for bringing up her fellow woman’s motherhood to make feel less. Erica is equally wrong but I blame the LHHATL production for putting this women against themselves it’s too much
It’s the way people are defending Spice like she a victim when they both are WRONG in the situation, Bambi just learned of the slur part from Sierra on the bus, Sierra learned the slur part from Spice, Erica didn’t tell them everything pls as you can see obviously Erica ain’t talking to no one as she riding somewhere with her kids and the assistant to one of her jobs, Sierra literally said they only talked about the “son” part of the fight and Erica didn’t mention anything else, Sierra also said that her friend was wrong for what she said, so how is she fake? Y’all just keep justifying Spice’s antics just like when she Fat shamed Tokyo and attacked Shay Johnson for no reason on the Family reunion and her exercise is Everyone is jealous who she gonna fight next, Tokyo ✅ Shay ✅ Karlie ✅ Meda ✅ Erica M ✅ Tommie ✅ Bambi ✅ Sierra ✅
Spice is annoying and di-s-g-us-tin-g
Yuhhhhhhh spice said safarree ain’t start nun dets just because sierra want a storyline off him leave the man alone
The ghetto
Spice always getting mad at the wrong person.
Kirks face killed me LMFAOOOO
Omg!😮
I’m not a Bambi fan but she literally isn’t in the wrong
What's Erica's job? What does she do?
tbh i never like érica or gave a fuck abt her but y’all let spice slide w the shit she does or says and it’s hypocritical. she acts like she doesn’t insert herself in peoples business and acts like she has an easy approach
I understand Spice was angry because that dumb Erica had no reason calling her a monkey. 🤨🤨🤨That was so hateful and racist and dirty of her, but I feel like Bambi and Sierra was trying to explain and be kind to Spice.💖 Bambi and Sierra probably was embarrassed that Erica even said that awful thing to Spice. I feel like the screaming and fussing could have been avoided and Bambi, Spice, and Sierra could have talked it out in a better way. Those 2 were not trying to attack Spice and they weren't yelling at her, but Spice feelings were really hurt so I understand her anger, but fighting Bambi and Sierra wasn't going to make it better. She should have POP💥💥💥 Erica in her big mouth but besides that Bambi and Sierra could have said, "Spice I'm sorry that Erica said that hurtful stuff to you and we are on your side, and we will handle her and talk to her about it." But those 2 did nothing.😐😐😐
I’m sicka spice ass
Ugh I hate what Spice has become on this show. She used to be one of my faves.  Now she’s just acting jaded and bitter like the rest of them smh. She needs to get off this show…..it’s gonna start to hurt her brand if she keeps this up.
I think Spice needs to gracefully step away fr this show. She seems too good and out of place for this.
Crazy how we all ignoring the fact that spice has had so much beef, with almost everyone. She’s been angry!
Spice is very angry ,
I wish Spice hadn't joined this show. I thought she was too grown for this behavior.
she's really starting to act like one, like sis chill tf out
Spice mad about Erica calling her a blue monkey but you just call someone a giraffe and a bitch
Spice needs to chill man.. No one is beyond correction
🌶💙
Omg spice so angry calm down Aunty pressure real go catch bp nut nice
I can never keep up with all this I’m glad I don’t watch the show! So much drama to follow lol
And I’m confused, are we not watching the same clip here… Bambi was the one who came at spice crazy saying who the fuck are you talking to when spice called them fake … and yes both of them are fake let’s not act like before this episode was recorded. They didn’t know what Erica said It’s all over the Internet, so how could they not know? Even Sierra said that she spoke to Erica about it and told her she was fucked up for saying that, so how would Bambi not know about it? They’re both fake in my opinion. Talking abt  Erica been working 🤣like smh tht had nothing to do with her calling spice a monkey … it’s giving neither one of them wanted to address the situation and thats sad because they’re both black honestly after this, I wouldn’t even be friends with Erica anymore
Spice is a clown 💯
Sierra is fake and Bambi is faker than Erica. It’s one thing for someone to say a racial slur but it’s another for the friend who is black to defend the person who said the racial slur. I can’t believe I actually liked sierra at 1 time. Your husband did great by leaving you.
Spice clearly said she was talking to Sierra point blank. Bambi got defensive cause she thought Spice was talking to her
🍲🤥 🍝🤥🍱🧇     🚧🥤👀
Spice NEVER, and I repeat, NEVER spoke about Erica's first born son. Speaking on Erica's son would require negative comments to be said about Erica's son as an individual. Spice spoke on Erica's PARENTING, which is TRIGGERING for the deadbeats. That is why DEADBEATS hijacked the term "Kids are off limits' to shield themselves from having their PARENTING questioned. Everybody acting dumb to this must be a DEADBEAT.
What E said  waz wrong  Yes! But she has no history of racism jet nobody sayin its wrong Spice throwing a low blow to E about her son not liking her ! They both are wrong but spice be fighting with everyone
I think the main premise is spice is a non nonsense type and people that are usually fake can’t handle her direct approach so when Bambi playin with the woman intelligence in her face actin like she didn’t speak to Erica on the situation u playin wit her n she got called out for it cuz this is a serious issue
Them too bloodclatt fake fr
*Renni got me dying laughing*
These women out here selling their souls and acting a fool for a dollar.
Spice is doing too much this season. Erica was wrong for calling her a blue monkey but Bambi and Sierra got nothing to do with it. If I'm wrong, can somebody make me understand 😥
How is a blue monkey a racial slur ?????????
Erica wasn’t wrong
So... who else was spice talking to when she said “you guys are so fake”? Jamaicans are so backwards I can’t
Bambi a clown just like Erica and lowkey she feel the same way as Erica
I hate that as women of color we don’t stand up for each other. We fight the world daily so uplifting each other is a must.  Although it’s been said before Spice should not have brought up Erica’s parenting or lack there of. She actually didn’t say anything negative about her son at all. She said he don’t like his mother…. Now a hit dog gone yelp everytime. She definitely struck a nerve. The monkey thing though is over the top and I believe as soon as they heard about it they called her. So sitting at that table saying you haven’t talked to her about it is a lie. Maybe not extensive conversation but at the very least a what the fuck did you say to spice was asked.  OAN three women bonding over their failed marriages and relationships is a recipe for disaster. Someone has to heal. Sitting around festering in toxic bitterness and bullshit is crazy.
Spice you need to trim down your wings. Just becoz youre doing fine in music dont mean you treat people like trush. The fact that spice came from jamica a few years ago and is treating her friends in such a discusting way when all they did is welcome and support her ,makes me not like her.
Spice KNOWS the truth 💯
Spice needs to chill, many peeps have been there before, isn't a time she seriously wanted to bleach? Mimi had to stop her!
Atp it’s Spice
So spice can Say whatever she wants to everyone, bringing someone kids is more serious than calling someone a monkey, c’mon now.
I’m really ready for Bambi to go. So annoying.
Spice was done wrong, but she wrong for wanting to attack Bambi and Sierra. As for Sierra mentioning Safari...woo child💔🤣🤣 Maybe Bambi and Sierra should have tried talking to Spice privately prior to the shoot or scene being taken😏
Idc Idc Spice should be fired too, can't understand most of what she's saying anyways so how do they even have a conversation with her having a language barrier
Spicy is allover the place this season. Like yes Erica made a mistake calling her that out of anger but spice should stop going off on everyone. Looks like her surgery effect has changed her whole attitude
I love spice “ but she be lowering her self going in like a crazy person “ it just makes her look weak and unstable “
Spice: ya'll always blaming someone else, also Spice: blaming Bambi for what Erica did to her. God gave you a second chance to act a damn fool like this really, didn't you say your scare is still healing, but yest you jumping up for fight people. I think the plan is to get the tight face crew off the show😂😂
Spice did entirely way too much
what is going on with yandy makeup 👁️👄👁️
Why both were wrong . Being racist ain’t okay but also never talk about kids .did she just call her a giraffe? Nah spice like to insult people remember when she fat shaming
Spice big mad with the bam over Erica girl 😂😂😂 stop it …
You haven’t talked to your best friend 😔🤭
What Erica said to spice was wrong af but spice is such a mean girl. She did not have to talk to Bambi like that.
Y’all need to stop saying if she spoke bad about my son then I’d call her a monkey and so forth when Spice never once spoke ill of Erica son when everyone else has, Spice said “ that’s why your son don’t like you” she didn’t speak ill of him at all, she only spoke about her  . She didn’t deserve to be called a blue monkey or she should have died when that girl had two kids. Also Spice, I would be upset at the fakeness but Bambi owes you nothing, you mad at Erica and Honestly no security could’ve have hold me cause I’d quit on spot just to whooped Erica lizard looking ass.
Why they keep letting spice get away disrespecting people & pushing people's buttons . . She going awf on everybody accept for safaee the one that started all this drama .  idk if it's a Jamaican thing but she going awf on the wrong people .
Who cares ??? LMFAO
Out of aaaaallll the insults she could've chosen. She chose to call a black woman a MONKEY!😂😂   No one in their right mind would ever think that's okay. That isnt something to sweep under the rug
Spice is wrong even though I dont like Bambi. She clearly said they ain't talk in full details about that.  She also said that Seirra just told her but she haven't  talked to bambi since Sierra told her. Spice is mad at everybody for what..
Bambi said she talked to her not about that.
jah god this is not looking good at all
Ain’t spice the one who wanted to change her skin colour…
All y’all fake.
Spice is 100 percent accurate! They are fake as hell!
What Erica said was dead ass WRONG, no excuses! and if she was my friend, I would have a talk with her about the fact that she is wrong BUT what Spice said was way below the damn belt! You don’t get to hit people where u know it hurts worse (her son) and think he/she is gonna be the bigger person. I’m SICK of Spice and her wanting everyone to kiss her ass and acting like a victim. EVERY episode, she does the same shit!
So she can call Bambi a giraffe??
Sierra isnt friendswith Bam or Erica anymore yet these GOOFIES are on here pleading for Erica who got 🔥 FIRED💥 & Bam (ADDIE😂) who got ARRESTED 👈🏾 because of Erica👈🏾 (who BIT the Sguard then LIED & said she was PREGNANT too) just last week. 😂😂😂  Make sense of it? Hence "GOOFIES!" You HATE THE TRUTH. Stop being the DEVILS 😈 advocates 🤪 Your chances for being HERO"s are gone! Enough already 😂😊 👋🏾🥴😂😜
Mannn listen….‼️ Ain’t nobody slow 😂 yk damn well Erica was speaking on the situation ‼️ Bambi ain’t tryna lose her job tho 😂
i am getting tired of Spice she is always is explosion mode . why is she soo angry
As a Jamaican, leave spice alone plz, for YALL SAFETY 💯
Erica was not being racist and I am very pro black. Love and Hip Hop wrong for firing her.
Girl spice at the end of the fucking day that ain’t got shit to do with Bambi
Its difficult to deal with other black women siding with a racist woman (whose been racist to black men & women repeatedly) when you're the one she was racist to. Like Erica will do the same to them & they dont get it. Then they're being fake about it too. Spice anger & frustration is very much understandable. So sad blk ppl just dont want to get it together.
I completely understand why Spice is so on edge….Bambi def heard about the convo and how Sierra gone blame what Erica said on Safaree 💀💀 they so fake
Man kinda feel for Bambi
Did they ever “TALK”
Spice is annoying
A lot of y’all need some healing cause the way y’all are up Spice’s ass is incredible. Keeping it real doesn’t give you the right to disrespect people or excuse your lack of communication skills. It’s not your business what they spoke about and I believe Erica was too embarrassed to tell her friends what she called her esp knowing how that would be received by fellow black folk. Therefore, when Bambi said that she didn’t know about the comment, she was probably telling the truth on top of that she’s going through a divorce. Whatever beef Erica & Spice have are the least of her concerns. For Yandy to ambush her like that - that’s some bulshht. Yandy always running her mouth like she Mother Theresa knowing damn well she messy too. Spice is hellbent on keeping it real, girl pick up some weights and worry about ya health cause for someone with tender scars and still wanting to fight, it don’t seem like you’re grateful to be alive. SMFH
Sierra threw the blame at Saffari. Saffari didn’t make Erica call Spice that slur. Sierra def throw blame alot. Bambi def had a conversation with Erica about the slur
Spice needs to go. She is really disgusting . Its bcuz, safaree carrying news as a man & is the problem. Spice dont like her colour & its nobody's fault. Im Jamaican. She was wrong for mentioning the woman's child & when the woman went below the belt she was fired. That some bullshit. Y tell the woman her child dont like her.its not her business. Spice acting like she's the baddest thing.she needs to go. Bambi & erica is fren . Even if  they discussed it . What she wants from her applogy. She started it. Fire spice. She's evil
I'm So Tired Of Spice An This Dam Blue Hair An Blue Clothing Like Girl .....
🤣😂🤣 Did Spice just say to Bambi.. "I told you all she said!".. I'm sorry, but... Spice wants everyone to take her side with everything!. Yes Erica was dead ass wrong and she should've been fired ASAP!, and with that.... Spice doesn't get a pass either. She should've never mentioned Erica's son. Now she wants to fight Bambi!!!... Spice you better run, Bambi will have you tied up in the truck  of somebody's car!. 😂🤣😂🤣😂
Why she always start a fight n why the hell she call bambi a b* girl byeee ...😅
Bambi ant the issue Frist off she's right I need to speak with my friend Frist
Y’all be forgetting that scrappy said some ish about Erica’s son too but suddenly Spice says it and she wrong
Giraffe ain't never been considered a racial slur or had a history of being one however for black people monkey has. End of story. She knew exactly what she was calling her. I wonder how she'd feel if someone referred to her children as such.  For them to sit up there as black women and not take issue with it is crazy.
Spice starting sh…. Again she is the problem
Spice is just annoying like anybody has to answer to her 😒 Erica couldn’t call her a Blue Monkey but Spice can call Bambi a giraffe FOH
i didn't get to see this one it wasn't on last week
I hope Spice isnt so Lucky next time
I was never a fan of Spice
Spice is getting on my damn nerves now...I need Joseline to come back and beat her big ass mouth
There ain't no fake here the only fake is the person with the problem lmao that's fake 💯
Bambi, gurl... you're protecting someone who calls black women monkeys, nooo.
Now she name called Bambi a giraffe 🦒 spice now that’s Bi-standards what the producers got to say about this one?🤷🏽‍♂️
You are not your "best friend's" keeper. Spice had no right to react like that, even if Erica spoke to Bambi about that why is Spice concerned about her friendship. Entitlement energy and Queen bee energy coming from Spice. 😢
Yandi so boring. Ofc she on ATL now, them checks ain’t coming no other way 💀
Idk but Spice was very toxic this season. Treating Karlie like dirt, and expecting the whole world to know that she was in the hospital. Like girl, no one knows you outta this show. Leave Bambi alone because we all know one thing, Bambi was on Basketball Wives, and she will eat Spice tf up. Spice was the constant negative for me on this show. Always the victim.
I dont like the tight face crew or Spice. This why I say this whole spice victim crap is bs. Spice been a ticking time bomb and her az do look like a flying monkey from the wiz. Calling that lady  bihs and giraffe.
I’m on spices side!! They are fakes!! Spice is beautiful and stilled listening today’s!!
Bambi doesn’t care about what her friend said bc she’s colorist. Remember the reunion when her and scrappy were sitting there making fun of Erica Dixon. She was saying her hair is nappy and that she looks like Wesley snipes🙄 We all know Erica Dixon is gorg, they only compared her to Wesley snipes bc she’s brown
Spice acted exactly the way she was suppose to bcuz being real and sitting around a bunch of fake shit One or two things gon happen either you gone speck on it or remove yourself from the equation And honestly I dnt really see anything wrong w/ wht spice said I mean damn all she said was your son dnt like you“IF” it ain’t true then whts the problem🤔Bcuz truth be told she could’ve said alot worse after hearing Erica talk abt her on Tht voice recording while she was fighting for her life in the hospital Cuz she was really hurt bcuz she considered this girl a friend then she turnt around and said spice should’ve died followed by calling her a blue 🙉 Erica was never her friend And the reason it was so damn easy for her to say all those hurtful things And kept repeating it was bcuz these were things she’s been wanting to get off her chest But I just dnt get how alot of people in the past has said way worse shit abt her sons and all of a sudden it’s an issue bcuz spice said they didn’t like her Like come on Erica spice remarks has nothing to do w/ it your madd bcuz spice Amara && safaree all were featured in tht photo when spice went to Miami But little do she not know spice && Amara been friends way before spice even met Erica Tf😎🤦🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
Bambi said oh ok talk to sierra then.
Kirk looking like here we go! Not at Rasheeda's birthday dinner y'all. 🤣
This is so wrong why everyone blaming erica nah spice you need to mind your own business and stop talking about someone’s child man come-on guys 😏😏😏😏
Spice always throwing rocks and hiding her hand sbut okay 😂
This is a hot mess how they start all this drama
Spice is coming for everyone fore her ass
But how is Spice mad at the friends when they weren’t there and didn’t call her anything!!! Also Spice whole energy was off from the door I’m sorry she was wrong as was Erica however Spice  started it and went off topic that Erica was originally on!! Erica was talking about what really happened between her and her then husband Spoce goes on to talk about Erica son not liking her 😒 like why did that even come up??? And I’m arguments there are no rules!! Period!! Everybody can say what they want except certain ppl.. Erica is the only minority on the show and she gets  fired lmao I would sue the shit of them.
I don’t care what nobody say SPICE IS DOING TOOOOOO MUCH. She is lashing out and on the defense due to her own trauma. Yes, ERICA is wrong for calling her a 🐒 but spice opened up that wound of Erica’s about her son not liking her and then to literally yell out “ Well my son loves me, loooovvvees me!” Whatever she said. That’s triggering. I understand Erica on where she is coming from. Yes others have said it to her but it wasn’t from a person she considered a “ Good Friend”. So yes I’m feeling a way about you now because you’ve felt like this all along and you’ve been waiting to get it off your chest. The reaction she got was LHHNY Erica! Like I said she was wrong for the monkey comment, but if we being real punish both of them. Just my thoughts and I’m bored 🤭🤷🏾‍♂️
When mendecees and yandy turn their heads😂😂😂
The way Yandy and Mendeeces turned at the same time 😂😂
As a black woman I couldn’t be cool with Ericka.. I don’t follow the show but Spice didn’t say anything bad about Ericka child except for the fact that he doesn’t like her… then Ericka SPAZZED real bad! It’s crazy
But Bambi likes to argue with children on social media so ya!
Stop calling Bambi a horse period or anything else for that matter. Then maybe she’ll come to your defense. Black women call each other everything except a child of God but want protection and ppl to stand for them when they are called names by non black ppl  It’s no different then the N word if we want ppl to stop saying then we need to be an example period… and I’m black!!!
This show need be canceled I’m tired of seeing black woman is this era
Spice member you were at death door charm the fuck down, yu a get  a bit too much
When hasn't Bambi been fake
Spice is a user she used Karlie Redd icecloud to come on Love & hip Hop and get familiar with the cast and then when she work in herself trow up and spit out Karlie Redd she's going to get what's coming to her spice is going to get what's coming to her
Sooo spice can call Bambi and giraffe and that's ok?????? But can't noone call her a monkey??? Next
GO SPICE
How you gonna get mad cause somebody match your energy. lol
Spice at it again. I will say this I don’t condone the monkey comment but what I discuss with my friend is my business Bambi didn’t owe her dust. Spice has been on one and super messy funny how she doesn’t like the B word but out the gate she starts name calling she’s a bully I never really cared for her but she on some next level ish lately.
I LIKE SPICE BUT YOU COMING OFF LIKE A BULLYING NOW ALWAYS JUMPING UP READY FIGHT 😮IJS STOP JUMPING UP SO MUCH GONNA MEET HER MATCH SHE KEEP THIS UP!! 😊
Spice is so passive aggressive af Same person saying idl that bitch word  Literally Bambi was talking and you responded soooo clearly you was talking to her Where yo man at- stay in your home 🙄
Damn.... Spice going down the line with everyone first Karlie, Meda, Shekinah, Erica now Tight face squad 😂😂😂😂😂. Like... Damn blues clues get a grip 😂😂😂. And the fact that Sierra talking about everybody really mad about what Safaree started. I'm just like as you can see, he ain't nowhere to be found right now.
Spice needs to (calm down!) This time she started the messy argument at the table, spice you was wrong! & Out of line! For calling them 2 women B*tchs, spice your the problem! This time!
The gag is spice realizes she is not n attractive woman at all, and nevr had real self esteem. The issue is spice is actually an extremely bitter black woman.
I think spice is just done with the bullshit these women are on. She did cut off Karlie and she just done with the bullshit.   Im also glad y’all see this lil wanna be “mean girl” trio who act like lil ass girls but they in their 30s grow the fuck up take accountability instead agreeing w the lame shit ERICA or BAMBI does they really weird
My thing is this why is everyone always fighting safari battles .. the dude is wack and always has a female doing his dirty work mean while he's over there hiding like a ...
Naaa spice wrong right here. She just taking it out on bambi and sierra cause they affiliate with Erica . Spice should direct all that energy to erica not noone else . How you gonna tell someone they lying . Bambi might not have been lying at all . Third of all erica and spice were wrong and said nasty ass shit to each other . Spice think she can woop everyone ass.  Baby you cant beat everyone up.
yandy smith started it knowing she is also a hypocrate in calling people monkeys plus spice is not a loyal friend herself how she treated karlie and tokyo plus spice is doing to much the bam did not do nothing to her trying to start stuff how she throw the lemonade at shay she is starting to get on my nerves
I hope Spice isnt so Lucky next time
All I see is blue monkey 🙈
Spice spice spice… Erica called you a blue monkey bcz you look like one to her. Now you go and call Bambi a giraffe bcz she looks like one to you. Like HUH?! Now I get monkey is considered a racist word but I honestly don’t feel that Erica is racist. In my black ass opinion Spice DOES look like a blue monkey, hell a blue ape as well. Point is the entire cast calls each other all types of animals just like how Spice did in this clip. Spice is always throwing rocks and hiding her hands… then plays victim. I’m so over her  Argue witcha Mammy.
Spice wig look a fucking mess 😂😂😂😂😂
Spice to angry
Where is the outrage for Spice calling Bambi a giraffe?????? The hypocrisy is so real
Kirk has hair.
Spice said WHY ARE YALL SO FAKE 🙄,MEANING SHE WAS ADDRESSING BAMBI AS WELL..make it make sense.
Spice started to feel herself when Safaree told her he liked her.. thats the only reason she was being a bitch to Erica. No where in the whole fight did she called her a black monkey, she called her a blue monkey!!!
I'm glad that spice is showing her true colors. Not only does she disregard her part & not take accountability on top of that she's disrespectful calling Bambi a bish & she's defensive and rude. Erica is wrong but so is spice bc she throws stones then hides her hands 💯❗️
spices wig was not it
🔵🔵🔵🔵🐒🐒🐒🐒
Spice is too angry and loud 📢📢📢🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Safaree is the real clown ( and I want to use another word) in this debacle. He’s a first class idiot and a very confused individual who just needs to come out of his role. It’s a shame the women are arguing and fighting with each other over his shenanigans.  Spice is Jamaican like him and may feel she has to have his back. She needs to drop his ass. Ankara too. He’s just an idiot in fur.
I told Bambi she was wrong, 🙄  queen of k00ns Bambi knows what she said, fake azz mammi
Spice was the one that started  all this messy
Spice doing too much as usual
I thought Yandy was B. Simone! WTH going on !!
1:17 😂😂😂😂😂 Yandi and Mendecee need some popcorn
Spice  us crazy
Spice I expect better from you. why are you letting people get under your skin? The children are watching!
Spice sit down before you rip a gut open.
Spice doing way too much
Bambi had an attitude from the jump to me
Ok spice can’t fight everything
Spice hates being called a B*tch yet calls other people (including Babmbi here) a b*tches. She wanted to play victim, and y'all dragged Erica for calling her a monkey, YET she literally called Bambi a giraffe multiple times here. Y'all need to drag her the same way y'all did Erica. The selective outrage y'all have is crazy...
Spice you are starting to look ridiculous with the blue hairs and only blue clothing. If you need a gimmick to stay relevant,  you were never relevant to begin with
Am I the only one frustrated by spice
Dark skin women are so aggressive 😩
But spice was the same woman that was thinking about bleaching her skin! Did everybody forget that lol Spice is unhinged and be popping off on everybody but ain’t nobody speaking on that. Spice is no victim
Spice needs to calm down
I didn’t know calling someone a blue monkey was something so major when their kid was brought up in what was suppose to be a civil conversation Spice is not a cute to me so I would have hung the shit outta her ass too, this racism narrative kills me. A diss is a diss disrespect is disrespect I said what I said!
Erica's wrong and Spice is Wrong...1000000%
Another of people understand Jamaican language  therefore spice beeeeennnnn supposed cut from show
Spice said "why are y'all always so fake" then proceeds to say she was only talking to only Cierra. Make it make sense. smh
😂 Spice is saying 🗣️Bitch now omg I'm 💀 I love me some Spice honey 😂😂😁
Wow 😯
Bambi was trying keep peace and not stir up the pot with the subject and move on quickly....you can tell.....but MS Spice in her feelings wants take her anger out on them over the Ericka situation
Was Spice high or drunk?😂😂I'm with Bambi.Why u so mad?Bambi is so cool and unbothered wit her fine self.🫶🏾🫶🏾2:27 🤣💀
It’s the way Mendecees and Yandy turned their heads in unison.
Spice way out of line
Yandy and Spice your on tv…
Spice is giving Lowkey jealous and insecure vibes.
Spice is just Rude I’m not a fan of her this season.
Sierra sit the fuck down ima black woman girl
I’m not on anyone’s side but Spice mad at being called a blue monkey but she’s calling someone a giraffe…ok
Spice don’t burst your stitches.. Sit down!
Erica, Bambi & Sierra calling themselves “Mean girls” or “bad girls” (whatever it was) @ 40+ y/o is crazy to me 😂
Spice was saying y'all y'all y'all soon as she say who TF you talking to she say she was talking to sierra smh spice so messy
Spice is getting on my nerves...Now she wants to fight everybody...They should have left her ass home if they wanted to have a good time. All this drama is the product of her mouth.
Ok. What did spice want to hear from Bambi and Sierra? Why spice is so concern if erica went to them or not. Thats erica friends if her friends dont want to speak on it then her friends wont speak on it. Especially if erica is not there to deffend herself.
Bambi & Sierra gotta go with Erica, please‼️
At this point i think spice is doing too much, she has too many complexe...i use to like her but now i think she is fake
Come on black peoples always make racial slurs. But when it’s the other way around it always has to be so deep. I’ve seen Asian, white hispanics that look like a monkey. It don’t always have to a be a racial thing and she called her a blue monkey
okay. i understand that spice was wrong for going after erica’s relationship with her son (as that can be triggering for erica) but that doesn’t compare to calling someone a RACIAL SLUR that’s offensive to not only spice but the WHOLE BLACK COMMUNITY (when she herself literally has biracial children who are black) and telling her that she should’ve died from her near death experience after she literally told spice “ i was actually upset what was happening to you yeah so much so that me and my friend we fasted for two days…” erica had every right to be upset as soon as spice said “with your son that don’t like you” and could’ve brought up any other comebacks to go after spice without going after her race. there’s people out there that argues when their child gets brought up and doesn’t say racist things. this also isn’t the first time erica calls a black person a monkey lets bffr. erica using this opportunity to show her TRUE colors and feelings towards black people especially black women says alot about her. whether she is mixed race, latina, or racially ambiguous she hangs around unambiguous black people and thinks she’s better than them and doesn’t even like them fr especially darkskinned black women. it’s truly sad that there’s black people defending her racism and not calling her out. smh.
That's is what they came there to do a confutation
How they thought it wasn't gonna not be Drama..... Blue need to see the 1 & only not all the friends (Sad)
I would Rather for someone to tell me my son is ugly than for someone to tell me that my son hates me or doesn't love me that cuts deep. in my opinion they both wrong.
Spice is always angry 🙄 it's exhausting
how spice gone get mad when BAMBI was talking first? like then spice said "why YALL so fake" looking in sierra and bambi's direction.. bambi and sierra had the same face reaction so SPICE you weren't clear on who you were speaking too and that's why bambi asked who was she talking to?
And spice was real none of 3 are friends anymore 😂😂
3:00 ❤ SHE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT ERICA SAID BUT SHE WASN'T ABLE TO HANDLE THE LAST CONVERSATION WITH ERICA. SHE WAS UPSET, SHE THROW A LOW BLOW AND ERICA THROW EVEN LOWER BLOWS. SO WHY NOT JUST LEAVE THAT ALONE? SHE CAN'T BE THE BULLY AND THE VICTIM SHES CAUSING HER OWN SELF AFFLICTING WOUNDS. ALL THIS BECAUSE SHE'S ENTERTAINING SARFAREE DISRESPECTING ERCIA, AND SIERRA AND THE WOMEN HE'S HAVING RELATIONSHIPS WITH. AND SPICE THROWING UP SHE'S NOT THE FIRST SINGLE MOTHER. ERICA OR NO ONE ELSE EVER SAID THAT ERICA WAS THE FIRST SINGLE MOTHER. THATS SPICE WAY OF DISSING ERICA. RATHER ERICA A SINGLE MOTHER OR NOT, THATS BESIDE THE POINT AND IT IS NONE OF SPICE BUSINESS OR CONCERN. SPICE DONT TAKE CARE ERICA CHILDREN. THEREFORE SHE HAS NO BUSINESS EVEN GET IN THE MIDDLE OF ERICA AND SARAFEE BUSINESS.I DON'T CARE IF HER FRIEND DO DATE SARAFEE THAT DON'T GIVE HER NO EXCUSE TO DISRESPECT ERICA. ERICA SHOULD HAVE BACK 🔙 OFF BECAUSE OF SPICE OPINION ABOUT SOMETHING SHE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT BETWEEN ERICA AND SARAFEE. AND ITS ALSO MESSED UP THESE MEN ARE INTENTIONALLY PAYING CHILD 🚸 SUPPORT LATE AND GOING BACK 🔙 HAVING SEX WITH THE MOTHER OF THEIR CHILDREN TO GET THEIR SEXUAL SERVICES TO CALL IT PAYBACK FOR 🚸 SUPPORT. ERICA SHOULD GO BACK 🔙 TO COURT AND TELL THE JUDGE 💟💕 HE PAYS LATE INTENTIONALLY AND PLAYING WITH HER HEART AND MINE HAVING SEX WITH HER IN OTHER WORDS HIS CHILD 🚸 SUPPORT MONEY IS REALLY SEXUAL PAYMENTS. SO ITS BASICALLY LIKE HE'S NOT EVEN PAYING CHILD 🚸 SUPPORT. HE'S PAYING SEXUAL PAYMENTS. AND OR FILE A SEPARATE CASE TO BE PAID FOR ALL THE SEX HE HAS ASSISTED SHE HAVE WITH HIM. ESPECIALLY ON HER CUSTOM- AUNT FLOW-PERIOD. TELL THE JUDGES IT SAYS IN THE BIBLE NOT TO HAVE SEX WITH A 👠 👠♀️ WOMAN ON HER CUSTOM AND THE FACT THEIR NO LONGER MARRIED. IT'S CAUSING HARM TO HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LORD GOD IN JESUS CHRIST HOLY NAME 📛🙏. AND HER SOUL AND HER MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL AS HER PHYSICAL HEALTH. AND THE FACT HE'S HAVING UNPROTECTED SEX WITH OTHER PEOPLE. WHICH CAUSING HER TO BE AT HIGH RIST AND HE GAVE HER A STD ECT. SARAFEE AND LA MARA I BELIEVE IS TRYING TO HAVE A BABY 🐥🍼 TOGETHER, I BELIEVE SHES TRYING TO GET PREGNANT TO HURT ERICA AND GET EVEN WITH ERICA. AND CAUSING HARM IN HER FRIENDSHIPS, HE'S PUTTING HER LIFE IN JEOPARDY- NOWING SHE IS A PERSON THAT DOESN'T TOLERATE CONFUSION FROM OTHER PEOPLE. IN FACT HE SENT SPICE A RECORDING OF A PRIVATE CONVERSATION BETWEEN HER AND HIM. WHICH ERICA NEVER CONSENTED TO BE RECORDED. AND IT ESCALATED A ARGUMENT WHICH RELATED IN ERICA LOOSING HER JOB.
Spice needs a rabies vaccine 💉 stat smh
Spice had enough I understand they fake...
Lol spice don't Give a rats ass! She want all the smoke! And since her recovery she's packing Hella ammo 😅 I watch this show cuz she be spitting the truth and nothing else!! 💯 💥💥💥
they were being so fake  but still spice could have ignored their fake asses....she should have just read them in the same tone she had in the beginning.....sadly, spice is gonna always be portrayed as doing too much or being too aggressive, she's getting treated like OG on basketball wives and the reason for that is  obvious 🖤🖤
Yandy always starts it tryna act like she so concerned somebody bop her ass!!😂😂🙄
Funny thing is EVERYONE sitting at that table is fake😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 this is clown shit
Spice is doing too much.. what Bambi gotta do with anything?
I feel anybody in these comments talking against spice i automatically believe you dont understand the situation. A black woman beautiful at that got called a " BLUE MONKEY" and all those black women at that table even her friends "need to correct ts ASAP . The fact she got Jamaican KIDS and she's saying slurs like that says alot of about her character in GENERAL !!
Yandy and her hubby 😂❤
Ya'll might get mad, but I'm going to type my comment. Bambi needs to sit like a deer or a mule in headlights and pretend to be mute.
Bambi a clown n look how God works no scrappy n ur unhappy how dare u Atilla be friends with Erica a total mess n messy
But they're all fake. It's a show for publicity
damn what's going on with spice? why is she so angry? man.........
As a Caribbean woman Spice over doing it God give you a chance cakm tf down sometimes
I’m Shekinah at this dinner table. I ain’t letting that food go to waste. 😩😭😂
Spice to me is the most successful and iconic member to ever touch lhh...yes cardi was fr fr..but she left to get bigger.where as spice has been able to do just the same without compromising her loyalty to the show that brought her an american audience. Shes a beautiful musician who deserves the world . She reminds me so much of queen patra.

Spice always standing up for Safaree. Safaree is a hoe and she knows it.
Z
I wonder if they put anyone on the show saying spic, wetbag, or anything like that...what would ppl say then...
Look how spice is acting!! I think she is cause more issues with ppl for no reason. Bambi doesn’t owe Spice an explanation AT ALL! And whatever conversation Erica chooses told hold with her friends is her business.
Old McDonald had a farm because everybody a animal now 😭
Lmaoooo I am Renni😂🫶🏽 jus eating minding mine
Spice not having it this season
Bambi you need to get her. how many btchs are you gonna let her call you?!
Spice main message here is "as fellow black women, are y'all really going to defend her calling me a monkey, because if she feels that way about me. Y'all don't think she sitting around calling y'all monkeys behind y'all backs?" But it's crazy that Erica had children with a black man. Would she be okay if people called her children monkeys?
There is alot of hypocrites in the comments talking about oh spice is wrong how? Imagine if Erica was white woman and called spice a blue monkey y'all would be mad but spice never said anything wrong reason why Erica felt away about it because it's the truth that her son does Actually hates her and I'm Jamaican myself that's how Most of Jamaican people argue with each other curse each other out saying that your own children doesn't like you but you within yourself knows that's true why would you get mad that someone says to you oh your son don't like you and if it doesn't bother you, you can say yes my own children don't like me that's fine Erica is a racist she Deserved what happened to her and anyone who Agrees with What Erica said Seek some help
Spice called her a long ass bitch 😂😂😂
Spice has serious issues. Seek extensive therapy.
So much to unpack  - Mandy and Yandy turning their heads in sync lmaoo   - Spice turning up lmao and calling Bambi a giraffe 🦒  😂😂  - Shekinah and Sierra trying to deescalate an argument   😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why would yall bother Bam about anything she didn't say anything to Spice leave hef alone.
Man, Renni is just there enjoying her food I couldn't even focus on anyone but her, I'm like put Renni back 😅😅😅😅
Spice is changing... sad😢
You say anything about a kid.. call me a racist and santic ritual waker up of the dead a priest and all
I'm on NO side but The Bam shoulda gave Spice what she came fa cuz Spice ain't doing so good with her second chance  🤔 I'll dig in Erica a$$ on another video 🤦🏿‍♂️
Common denominator…Spice 🤷🏽‍♀️
Yandy and Mandeeces neck breaking back and forth😂😂😂
spice stood up on bambi now if bambi stood up and treid to fight her she would be wrong right ??? bambi nor sierra said the comment so why is she starting w them just becuase they are friends doesnt mean they agree with everything that is said .. if you just got a second chance at life why are you using it to fight and argue just my opinion .
Both spice and Erica is wrong. Erica should have never said that spice should have died and she never should have called her a monkey.   Spice shouldn’t have brought Erica’s son into it. She shouldn’t have mentioned him. Kids are off limits in any situation.   It seems as spice is always in drama this season .
Listen ….ain’t nobody can correct or speak to spice and it’s getting very annoying….whether she’s right or wrong….u to grown to be rah rahing every chance u get 😪
They don’t gotta repeat wtf they friend said they grown asl
Is that Karlee quite?! 😂
Idk. This has been too much lately. Now I think they doing this just for views now. Spice need to save that energy for Erica because at the end of the day she the one that said it, they didn’t.
Spice want the smoke I feel her
Renni fucking up that food lol
It dead ass funny how em 3 use to make fun of karlie talking about she's fake friend laughing TOGETHER 😅 it's really funny😂 because now look at them at it smh karlie must be somewhere giggling
It's not a racial slur when you are also black. As Black people we really need to educate ourselves on the difference between race and culture and what Afro-American and Afro-Latina means.
Spice needs a break too . Wow
Spice cool off cause you think everybody weak under yuh. I wish there wasnt no damn security there to see where their mouth reach... xause i know its all because they know security must part them why they are so hype.  Especially spice in this scene calling bambi bitch i dont see where that should have dropped in at the first place. Smh
YANDY AND MENDEESEES SIMOTANIOUS SIDE TURN WAS EVERYTHING!!! 😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🏵️
Safaree did Erica dirty, but Erica has always been a piece of work. Now she blames him for everything she does. Did he also cause her to get arrested? Girl, move on.
❤Spice
I understand spice but not once did Bambi say she didn’t speak to Erica. She said she hasn’t spoken to her about that AND sierra literally just said spice was the one that told her what Erica had  said
Is spice pregnant?
😂yandy sitting there all pretty and shit😂❤
IF ONLY SPICES EYES COULD TALK ...👀👄😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣
Spice is now above this show. She's needs to leave likes Cardi did
Spice must really like the color blue.
3:00 ❤BAMBI YOU SHOULDN'T AGREE TO WALK OFF FILM, SHE NOT A WOMAN 👠👠 TO TALK ON FILM. THEN THERE IS NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT. AND SPICE DON'T HAVE NO BUSINESS QUESTIONING YOU OR SIERRA ABOUT NOTHING ESPECIALLY WITH ERICA. IF SPICE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ERICA TELL HER AND CALL ERICA HERSELF. THEN AFTER SHE CALLED YOU LADIES THE B WORD SHE SWITCH UP AND SAID SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT SIERRA. SPICE HAS A DEMONIC SPIRIT IN HER AND YOU CAN SEE IT IN HERE ON FILM. SHE PICKING FIGHTS WITH YOU LADIES BECAUSE I BELIEVE SHE'S BEING DOING OR PRAYING WITCHCRAFT -SPELLS AND OR 🗣️ SPEAKING EVIL IN THE ATMOSPHERE AT YOU LADIES. THAT'S WHY YOU ALL GOING AGAINST ONE AND OTHER AND INTO IT WITH SPICE. BECAUSE THAT SPIRIT IF CONFUSION IS GOING BACK TO THE SOURCE IT CAME OUT OF.

THEY KNOW YOU NEED THAT MONEY 🤑💰 YOUR PAYCHECK TO TAKE CARE YOUR 🚸🚸 🚸 CHILDREN. SO THEY TRYING TO DOG 🐶🐕 YOU ALL TRYING TO MAKE YOU KISS THEIR BUTT FOR THAT PAYCHECK. ONE THING FOR SURE YOU LADIES NEED TO RECORD ⏺️ ON YOUR CELLPHONE 📱 AND IF SPICE OR ANY ONE TRY LAYING A HAND ON YOU DEFEND YOURSELF AND SUE HER. SHE'S SO OUT OF LINE!! 😞😭. SHE ASKING FOR TROUBLE SHE'S LOOKING FOR TROUBLE REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN HER AND ERICA SPICE HAS NO BUSINESS ADDRESSING BAMBI OR SIERRA WHAT HAPPEN BETWEEN HER IS BETWEEN HER AND ERICA. NOW SHE PUT YOU ALL IN THE MIDDLE.
Spice has a problem with pretty women 😂😂😂
Bambi and Sierra was fake for this. It’s almost as if they were trying to be political about it. Erica use the term monkey for to a black person and this ain’t the first time and they still on some protect Erica mode. She ain’t got time to talk cause she don’t want to face the subject. She ain’t busy.
As wrong as Erica was to bring it to race… Spice needs to also realize how cruel she was to tell her her son hates her and doesn’t like her. She said this MULTIPLE times over and over again in regards to her son. That is some evil shit to say! But again it’s crazy that in retaliation she said some racial stuff.
Bambi doesn’t have to say whether or not she talked to her… yall issue is y’all issue and we grown
I got called monkeys by other dark skin girls when I was in school so this whole Erica shit proves y'all don't like like lightskin girls 😂 black girls say it all the time MOVE ON!!!
Spice is a bully I can’t wait into she finds a bigger bully
Did they fight
Spice is the real colorist she has a problem with lighter skin women
She called Bambi a giraffe now fire her too.
It was yandy and her husband facial expression for me 😅😅
I wasn't going to say anything but... Regardless of the situation it should not have  been talked about without Erica being present. And what was said does not necessarily apply to a whole race in this context although she should have allowed her to act an ass all by herself. What I can say is she definitely "showed her true colors!" - Another term commonly used but not racially intended. And bringing kids in the mix was a malicious violation that should have never happened. She's grown and can defend herself but the kids aren't and someone else's kids that aren't hers should have never been in her mouth.😢 I hope in the future they are more protective of the children of the cast and keep it to an adult  conversation as needed.
At the end of the day Bambi don't have nothing to do with it that's between her and Erica Bambi was trying to be soft about it because she didn't want to talk about it she got her own problems spice been trying to bully people the whole season first Karlie redd because she didn't want her to move by her she was good enough to see her in the hospital  as a friend and now she tripping hell yeah Erica was wrong I'm a black woman myself but when Erica started off she was telling spice how inspiring she was to her and how she takes care of her kids spice was sour the whole time because of what safari told her that Erica was supposedly mad at spice being in the hospital and he was hurt true or not true I wouldn't have gave a fuck on that end being its coming from him and he had Erica so fucked up in playing games and cheating that was some weak shit and spice weak for even giving a fuck men like him play too many games it's a reason nicki got the fuck on and Amara a weak ass bitch too community dick ass ninja Spice went off on her because of what Safari said and Erica was holding that shit in brought up her son when she barely take care of hers and it was the tone and how she did that about her son where they do that at she tried to eat Erica up over that and in true Scorpio fashion in my blueface voice yeah aight she flip that shit over and all rules left I don't see her as being prejudice spice knew Erica's vulnerable trigger and trust Erica's knew spice everybody seen spice talking about her dark skin and even willing to change it anit no rules when you talk about kids that's it that's all fuck her feelings it would have not went that far if she didn't bring up her son .
Spice always got something to say then when somebody go oopsie daisy aside her head😭😭😭
Mona Scott should fire gummy horse Bambi already she ain't with scrappy anymore no reason for her lame ass to be on the show they need to bring Erica Dixon back
Spice is coming for everyone. She had a second chance in life and is being mad at the world.
What erica said to spice was meant for all black women..
I only think Spice is doing a little too much because let’s remember now… The person who said racial slurs and wish death upon someone was NOT Bambi or Sierra, and the real problem and person she’s mad at is Erica. I understand that was a lot on her but since she’s away from her maybe she should try to relax. We have to understand being put in that middle friend spot position is hard having your 2 friends fight to have one or the other say something out of line to where there not friends anymore and then you’re the friend having to choose a side cuz 1 hates the other now (I think we all been though that in life) come on now🤷‍♂️
The way Yandy and Mendeeces turned their heads in unison 😂
Wasn't my girl Spice always preaching not to call her a bitch, yet she's here calling everyone that today lol 😂
I don't like Bambi AT ALL. But for Spice to say she doesn't like fake sh*t then make that comment knowing she was referring to Bambi, but saying she was meaning Sierra is WILDDD
How Sierra just stood up and blamed safari was sooo fckn funny to me.
I see Bambi ain't have that energy with Erica tho... and I'm glad spice called them out on their bs
Everyone mentions the wrong Erica did but forget what spice did said too. Spice should catch the heat just like Erica. They both hit below the belt
Spice and everyone walking have never been in a zoo.  What the fuck stir up shit that happened by ppl we don't know to ppl we don't know is just too damn much.  Its always a victim mentality.  Don't insult people's parenting when that isn't th3 topic and be shocked when your low blow got you and even lower blow
Even if she did talk to her they don’t have to tell her nothing
Spice: why are y’all so fake !!? Bambi: wtf are you talking to ‼️ Spice: I’m not talk to you 🗣️  Pure comedy I swear 😂
Ion care 😂 spice saw through the bullshit and called it out. Even if they are “JUST COWORKERS AND NOT REAL FRIENDS”, it was still wrong to call spice a monkey and wish death on her…..and the audacity of them to PRETEND as if they never spoke about it is hilarious 😭 fake fuxk shxt at its finest.
This whole thing just opens up the convo of what spice has been saying the whole time "black hypocrisy"
Sound like Erica omitted that from the convos they had
Spice just wants to beef if I was Bambi I wouldn’t have opened my mouth an inch because imagine not knowing what happened and then someone expecting you to be on their side as opposed to their friend spice almost died and said she was going to take karlies messy ass position
On some real shit I wish red was next to spice she would of had spice back shenikan cuss spice not a damn friend she doesn't even have spice back in this one bye
Spice swear she bad ☠️🤣😭
Spiceeeeeeeee🤦🏽‍♀️ dam calm downnnnn
Bambi is fake lol 😆 she telling her the truth and Bambi can’t handle it people sometimes hate hearing the truth and Bambi got confronted with the truth Bambi doesn’t take full responsibility for her actions at all don’t know what Scrappy see in her nothing but bones 🦴 she doesn’t know how to truly love ❤️ and be real at all
Erica dead wrong to b calling her monkey because of issues that's happening fr fr
I’m so glad Tokyo isn’t on this show anymore
Spice is wack 👎👎👎
Bambi big stinking lier am that's why her ex husband see right through her an left her for her child yes Bambi fake long time
But Spice was talking to them… 💀. I’m Caribbean myself, so I know the bs when she’s giving it 🤣🤣🤣💯. “Oh she told you to say that?” Cause who was speaking when you made that remark…. Yea ok🙄
Spice was fake for that. She was clearly talking to bambi
Cancel the show please, disgusting 🤮🤢🤮🤢
Spice legit started the conversation with Bambi by saying “why you talk to your best friend” the conversation carried on then seirra spoke her Peice. Spice then says “why YALL so fake” so at what point was she not talking to bambi? I get that Erica said some wild shit but u tryna fight the whole crew when your beef is with one person. And safari definitely is the reason why y’all even arguing cus he doing Erica wild af and spice keep taking his side. If spice really safari friend she would tell that Nigga he wild
When spice call tokyo nobody says nothing
Spice is toomuch
If Bambi and Erica talked it's no one's business if they talked or what they talked. That is her friend. And no one knows what Bambi said about it. Spice and Erica were both wrong. Two wrongs don't make a right. Spice has every right to be mad but what you taking it out on Bambi for.
Bambi has always been fake. Especially since she got them uppers. Her hair and clothes were cheap and trashy until scrappy n lhh gave her a bit of money and style or stylist.
Bambi attitude screams that she knows . Girl don't make us call Erica
How could they even be friends with Erica especially that she's racist. They just look really dumb. Spice I feel you Queen.
How renni looking just eating 😂😂😂 2:44
They love bringing up safreee
Calm down now spice, this is becoming to ghetto. Stop attacking people shit man
Spice is a bully
Them fi take spice off the show  she  is too badddd
I don't blame Spice for calling them fake, Bambi especially.
I don’t like spice😭do way too much but when someone voice above a 5 she get mad. Girl sit tf down
Spice just keeps wanting reaction!
Spice  don’t  need  to be  around  these lady  she is to getto  she don’t need to be on the show she want to fight  every body she is to baddd she don’t meet her match yet
Yandy always starting drama🤦🏾‍♂️
Omg bambi's veneers.. UGH🤬
When spice talk about erica son she was out of line
MTV is total garbage these days
Spice look good in blue.
I can’t stand spice…. She get on my damn nerves thinking the whole revolve around her ass!!!
That Horse Teeth Getting On My Nerves.
Spice about to snap💥Bamboo🚩
Spice need to calm down and calling Bambi a bitch and want to fight girl bye, she doing to much
It's crazy to think that she was arrested with her after this. Maybe she will learn now, what good can come from that friendship?
They still doing this trash
Lol you all are arguing on here but missing the point. Calling anybody a racial slur is Ridiculous and Racist PERIOD!
Spice finna drag this whole thing and play victim
Spice is right they fake af
Spice should beat there ass
And again can’t nobody talk without yelling cussing or getting out their seats
Spice snapped on Bambi ass.I mean,she kept calling her a,BITCH🤣😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Spice is playing victim
Spice literally said what I was thinking lmao dang
You all supporting this degrading disrespectful show towards woman of colour....does this make sense black mothers?? So the white can laugh at us...we have forget where we are coming from
Spice and everybody a enemy this season wow
Spice is an old bitter never has been 🤣 another 🤡
Bambi said nothing because it won’t affect her because she is light skin and Erica wouldn't call her a monkey simple she didn't care
3 snaps up for my beautiful black sistren Spice! Check those lying dog dem for dust! They know they been talking to Erica! They should be calling her out for this, not supporting her! If anyone had called their children monkeys you would of seen how quick they would be to turn up and get all buck on that person. The hypocrisy with them plastic folk is too much! As for bambi...she gets on my damn nerves CONSTANTLY!
I can’t stand how us black folks love to pick and choose when to be outraged. They both was wrong and they so worried about I’m a black woman this and that but be acting all disrespectful and etc toward one another tho 😒 it don’t matter if it’s true on what spice said, don’t bring up people’s kids and don’t say nothing that is and can be a racial slur
Spice is actually tired and comply done with these fake hoes!!!
They were gaslighting the hell out of Spice.
They want to blame safaree for everything wrong lmao
Spice doing too much
Spice is doing too much.
I loooove spice yoo
spice shouldn’t be acting that way she is older than most of the crew members she should act her age and set the example
Spice is so tired of them..she been going off on them left and right.
People don't play about they kids! I feel like the gloves came off when she opened her mouth in the absolute wrong direction about her kid that's her first mistake period. I'm a black woman Erica calling her out of her name like that was crazy MuthaFu*kas is dying about they kids and over racial slurs period. I feel like the conversation did not have anything to do with her son. Spice was out of pocket wayyyy before Miss Mena, Erica just follwed suit. She was reaching to hurt her because is was beyond her that she would even mention her kid anyways. What the kids got to do with this???
Erica likes to call dark skin black people monkeys this was not her first, second , or third time doing this Racist
I like how the most of the cast kept eatin their food and sipping their drinks while the argument was going on.
“Why are you so mad” Erica literally was being incredibly racist da fuck 😑. Ofc light skins think it is okay
I love spice for checking bambi!
Now if you are truly friends with a person you should be able to call them out on their mess. Erica is hot headed and rarely listens but Bambi could have pulled her up. It does come a time as adults when you don't do BS and can see through it.
When ppl argue insults are usually said ppl are called out  their name black people aren't monkeys so why is everyone so sensitive we are 1 race the human race period !!!! I feel like its more a because she always wears blue and she was bending over slapping her ass telling erica to kiss it because erica is also black also spice has fat shamed and color shamed lighter skinned and white ppl many times soo 🤷‍♀️
Bambi was scared
spice low key messy
Calling her a GIRAFFE but crying cuz someone called you a Blue Monkey is funny 😂🤦🏽‍♀️
Spice So Aggressive & Combative All The Time! She Just Wants To Be The Center Of Attention! Like Somebody Supposed To Be Afraid Of Her When She Stands Up And Gets Loud! And Listen How She Kept Calling Bambie A B*tch! But Wants Everyone To Join The Race Train When It Came To Erica!🤨
:() Woe, Spice calling out "fake-b!tches". Spice says to Bambi, "Who tha fvck you talking to fake-b!tdh. Let's talk fake-b!tch ... common lets talk fake-b!tch, you wanna talk now b!tch., common." wow!
Y’all pushing it . She not obligated to tell her a dang thing even if she did talk to her that’s her damn business call it fake or whatever that’s her friend and she loyal to who she loyal too tf . Dang y’all want her to play both sides or pick one tf
People need to stop jumping up to "stop" their friend. Looks stupid and Unnecessary
This show just isn't the same...
Spice may not be monkey but she's definitely an angry black woman
But why is Spice into this round when she say she don’t like drama or have time for their business. She got time now.
Spice not entitled to know what Bambi nem was talking bout its none of her business… they not fake for not telling her…
Spice is NOT innocent like Bye
Spice and this blue hair is played out
Bambi and Seirra looking stupid now that the truth is out. Remember, they don't know or believe Erica racist azz would ever say anything like that.
Let’s be honest, speaking on someone’s parenting that they can change is one thing speaking on a person, skin color, and raised that they cannot change is a completely different situation!!! Calling a black woman, a blue monkey she knew exactly what she was saying. She just thought that she wouldn’t get in trouble.
She can be rude and disrespectful... call other cast members out their names and yet there is no consequence for her! Please make it make sense
Spice is not playing with the girls this season
But she dont have to tell them what her and her bff spoke about…
She’s way outta line I don’t like her she needs to be humble because she’s gonna get her match and find someone that puts her in her lane
Wasn’t Spice saying she doesn’t like being called a bitch, she dropped that word so many times in this scene.
Yet she still hasn't been fired!!!
Here we go again..spice in ppls business
Spice set these bitches straiiiiiiigght
okay i get why spice is mad but she is doing too much
Wait how she call Bambi a giraffe, but wanna cry about being called a monkey. 🥱😴😴 gurl plz.💯. it’s giving I can do it but she not black so she can’t … like Wht?..👀😮‍💨 I’m tired of blues clues crying to any and everybody.🥱😴😴✌🏾 I already knw Bambi snatched her up.😂😂😂
If she said she hadn't  really talked to her, then that's that spice  kept going on and on doing too too much she mad at all of erica friends
Mendeecees and Yandy when they turned their head 😂
How is ok for Spice to call Bambi a giraffe but Erica can’t call her a monkey?! She definitely acts like an animal! She called Bambi a bitch 50 x’s, she has very bad understanding & is extremely ignorant! Being called a monkey is actually a compliment for her! I would’ve called her an APE!
Mendecees look so outta place at these gatherings 😅 you can tell Yandy is dragging him along lol
Spice need it bad. Period. She shouldn't have disrespected that girl and her kid period and I'm black as she is
Yandy messy😂
This argument would have never happened if Yandy would’ve kept her mouth shut about the situation , So I thank  Yandy for opening up her mouth about the issue between spice and Erica.  If Chrissy would’ve been on the show Yandy wouldn’t have said two words. Y andy,  would’ve been quiet like a church mouse!!!
Spice want everyone to feel about Erica comment but she was body shamming Tokyo.
Why are people trying to excuse Erica’s behaviour?? She’s literally called black women AND men racial slurs on multiple occasions and y’all still riding for her?? You look like coons the lot of y’all 🤣
Spice is lit 😂😂😂😂
I’m sorry but I literally don’t care about Erica’s monkey comment. Im so tired of us getting into it about light dark skin. Spice wears that shot on her skin. They both said horrible shit.
Spice not fucking innocent and I’m tired of her aggressive ass always acting like a victim
Bambi is a fool. She rides with a woman who would call her a monkey at any given moment.  Erica is dangerous. In fact, Erica is the reason Bambi recently got arrested and now has charges.
No if someone had called spice a b word she would have been ready to fight 😩
Lol you all only bashing erica for calling spice a blue monkey but spice be calling people bit$h??? Hummm a bitch is a female dog !
It’s not bambis place. Go to the source.
Spice and Erica are wrong. Why does Spice have all this energy for Bambi and Sierra?. Miss Ma’am, you should’ve had that energy for the person who flipped the table on you. Spice was wrong for minding Erica’s business and should not have spoken on her son. Erica was wrong for calling Spice a monkey.
why bring all the mess with you on your special day leave all the mess home.
I want one mother in here to raise her hand and say she wouldn't be triggered if someone told her that her child doesn't like her. Im waiting. And Erica, your ass could've said anything about Spice except calling her a monkey. Its a racist slur and toatlly unacceptable. You wouldve won that argument in the court of public opinion if you didnt go racial. You were both wrong.
Bambi the one who started to get loud …
The only time I see anything about spice it’s beef never the music lmao
N all these lil girls know they gotta put on a show or it won't go anywhere 😂😂😂
Spice came to this show genuine and sweet they made her change and I don’t blame her the plastic face crew get on my damn nerves and once again the blaming safaree for something he did not do he didn’t call anybody a monkey erica did
She's VERY VERY FAKE
She IS THO .BAM WOULD N WAS SLEEPIN HER WAY IN TO THIS SHOW .NO MATTER  IF IT WAS WITH NO NECK BENZO OR WHAT EVER HIS FUNNY FACE NAME IS .😂😂😂
I feel like Spice's reaction here is NOT valid. I understand that she can't stand Bambi being fake and I too, feel like Bambi was lying. But shouting and calling her a bitch, especially after sooooo many episodes where she told "Tokyo" she hates the BITCH word? Hmmmm...
Now spice called  Bambi a giraffe so cancel  her as well
Bambi and Sierra are liars.
Ugh I love me some spice
Bambi and that alien looking girl is fake u can tell.. look how offended Bambi got soon as spice started talking Bambi ain’t slick
My little pony never has anything to say of substance
Yandy and Mendecee reactions got me dead af.😂😂
What’s going on with yandy smokey eyebrows
Spice said YALL so she was clearly talking to Bambi so don’t be mad becuase you sent for her and and she answered
Spixe doing to much once again gwr here lff the show omg
Spice needa go she got beef with everyone
I get spice DON'T  BE FUCKING FAKE AND BEHAVE LOST
Love spice. She can point out the phony
Why everyone always kissing spice ass tho?😂
These women are so broken every little thing they go to 100 it is ashamed people can’t have a simple conversation and come to an agreement I would never allowed myself to sit to anybody that is this loud and angry all the time it’s just to negative.
Spice was not wrong at all‼️ she seen what was going on and called it out .. that says a lot about who they are if they still friends with Erica after she said what she said period.. I'm tired of Bambi she love to act like she innocent like girl good night Spice Kno better
I hope they spoke one on one and not you know what 😊❤
What Erica said was messed up but let's not act like Spice isn't showing her ass!  She doesn't get a pass to be rude because she had a near death experience! I don't care for Bambi and Sierra and they lil clique either but Spice was doing the most! You mad at Erica not her friends! Spice has been feeling herself a bit much lately and it's giving i think I'm tha shit mean girl vibes! This definitely doesn't excuse Erica for the racial slur but if we calling people on the bs let's not forget Spice is giving plenty of reasons to be called on hers too!
Spice is a loud mouth bully, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!She gets what she gets!!!!!!!!, So Nowwwwwwwwwwww No Heard Spice Call Bambi A Giraff And Bitch This And Bitch That!!!!!!And Erica Called Spice A Blue Monkey For What Saffery Told Her About What Erica Son Said Or Didn't Say, Spice Was Wrong !!!!!!!!, Spice Thinks She Is All Big and Badddddddddddddd And now She What's to play victim, I Remember How She Ran Up On Shay Trying To Hit Her Because Of What That Lying A$$ Amada Had Told Her And Then The Way She Treated Tokyo was Just Disgusting, Spice is not Innocent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Just Saying.
I’m confused as to why spice went in like that. Lol
“Your son hates you” A mother can’t tell another mother that and expect anything civil to happen. Spice is a FaceTime parent, a fucking joke, and not a victim.
They use the term best friend so lightly lol
Yandi and Mendeeces moving they head in sync is funny
Spice is a leo we HATE FAKE SHIT!🫶🏽
Spice get up in rage. Bambi is not her friend, she don't have to explain shit to Spice. Spice quick to be on Safarri side. No one is noticing that, but everyone is quick to judge Erica. Spice you think you are bad, but it have someone worse than you. Be careful how you treat people. All these friends who are backing you right now is only on your train for a free ride.
👀☝🏾🤔
Spice calling bambi a Giraffe but she's the victim 😒
spice girl mi dun a pick up fi you when you dun call Bambi a giraffe in front of everybody di last time u and her friend did a get into it suh stop PLAYING VICTIM!!!!
Spice got on that blue 🔵 Dora the explorer wig on at the dinner table.
But look Cearia whatever the name spell.....quick to pick up for Bambi after she just talked about her saying they now friends....see how they fake.....look everyone else not even standing up for spice....SPICE YOU ALWAYS HAD IS NAME BEFORE THIS SH**TTTTTT OF A SHOW THAT I DONT WATCH....baby girl these Americans so call don't wanna be black women but they are don't like us  Caribbean women and the fact that you been doing and still is even better now.....they will hate each bone in your body and smile in yuh....just leave this sh***ttttt show....you bigger and better than this sis.....you don't need them! Your ppl love you period!
Nah Yandy and Mendeces lookin back and forth is me asf😂
Spice is always starting something! Then gets mad when someone stands up to her. She's ALWAYS calling them bitches & dares them to check her. Every scene I've seen is her starting an argument.
I like Spice but she can't get mad if them girls don't wanna tell her what they talk about as friends. Erica wasn't there so she shouldn't have brought anything up.
Bambi ain't gotta tell Spice nothing... 😂
I never liked bambi, Sierra and Erica at all
Spice is too much… people don’t want to admit it but she does the most every time.
It’s Mendeeces and Yandy turning their head in unison for me 😂😂😂
Spice like, Erica all yo freinds can get it! ...❤
Spice is always so aggressive its not cute
I’m sorry who put that hair on bambi ? Who ! They should be fired it looks like paint that’s been brushed through and spices wig I’m sorry but WHO!?
I'm not a big Erica fan but Spice started it ,she cut everyone off and think she can say what she wants it's crazy man all theses people acting like we don't black out shit I been called monkey black monkey white monkey bald headed All types of she during a argument Spice and Erica needs to be check Erica is too old and has 3 kids she should know how to control that temper and Spice has a problem where she doesn't wanna hear it once she has something set in her mind and she thinks she can say what she wants and handle everyone the same she goes off first if yall play attention but just my thoughts and nobody slapped Veronica for say Ni so miss me with the bull shit Trina was supposed to will Smith her at the reunion 😂
Damn what if Bambi just didn’t want to talk about the shit or give her opinion to them or have to justify Erica’s actions or whatever the case may have been? I would’ve said the same SHIT because that’s MY BESTFRIEND regardless y’all really need to stop acting like they wasn’t about to drag Bambi ALLLLLL in that shit
Spice can barely walk much less waddle. She better sit her inflated ass down somewhere 😂😂
Spice used to hate when people called her bitch but now she’s calling other people that like that’s fake and weird asf
Spice wants to be on the spotlight all the time, just being in everyones business. Is it really required for a people fighting to keep on saying “bitch”? Haahha
FIRST OF ALL SPICE TALKI NG TOO MUCH..and she need to watch her mouth..she started it with Erica..now Bambi...Spice spoke on Erica's son..which was wrong..Erica  said Blue Monkey to Spice..not you black monkey..so Spice need to chill..especially since she still healing from her surgery..she started it..you leave peoples kids our of it..this ia what you asked for. When u talk on someones kids....who cares what Safaree doing..his life..and Erica's life..
She can't get mad at everybody for what Erica said, I understand but how many b*tches did she just call her.
Yal no one listens but it's facts...they been hating and will keep hating because when it comes to the Love & Hip Hop Scene and Real Housewives they always gon be mad at the real artists and the real wives of the show. Add the part where Spice is Jamaican and the jealousy of stealing the thunder and actually not even from the hoods of ATL or NYC she is always going to receive hate. Ironically the ones up her behind are Karlie and Shekinah, the lame squad #teamhype 😅
I'm not a fan of Bambi but Spice is dead ass wrong here, Bambi already admitted to speaking with Erica and didn't go into deep about the Spice situation. That's what she said so what's wrong with that? 🤷🤷
Why Sierra cameltoe all up in the camera tho?
Erica is dead Azz wrong, but if you read her book --- then you will know what was done to her. Spice running around in everyone's business instead of minding your own kids that dont be with you either some of the time or you aint even been married with a fake ass dude, and then didn't listen when Bambi was trying to say they were dealing with the Safaree hitting on Sierra. Erica is mad that Safaree used her and lied and cant be a dad. but you up here showering Amara with rolexes and JUST STARTED paying child support. Having Joe Budden's ex on cam and showing out when she was giving birth. Safaree a whole type of disrespectful c&&t. Spice was never abused like Erica when she was pregnant either. So Spice now wants to be defensive but got in Tokyo's face before tho but don't realize she about nearly died and all you want is drama. Bringing up someone's kids knowing you had no business and then getting mad when she cursed you out calling you names. Stop it.
That’s why Spice get called everything, she be asking for it alil bit
Whu the fuck bambi gotta say rather she spoke with Erica that's her fucking friend what was sue suppose to do! Period
This argument was needed to show that Erica isn't the only problem, Look how quick she was to call Bambi out of her name for no reason at all.
All of y’all trying to put the blame on Spice instead of acknowledging that two black women are still cool with a racist Latina is crazyyyyyy… if Erica was white there’d be no hesitation to call her out…
A Jamaican going against a CRIP from Cali is crazy …   I wanna see it tho. 🫴🏽
I can't imagine acting like that on the normal
Bambi is colorist too. Don’t forget she referred to Erica Dixon’s hair as a “nappy ass bob” and said she looked like Wesley Snipes. Scrappy was over there laughing along and is now the same person tryna defend Erica’s behavior.  So we can’t expect much from them….and Bambi was most definitely lying
Spice annoying she started this whole argument at this moment ... Saying b this b that and getting up ...she aggressive asf
Spice starting to much stuff on purpose she getting to hype that ppl on her side
My question is this. Why is Bambi being held responsible for something Erica stated? She's not responsible for Erica's behavior. Erica is...
Now you attacking Bamby  love and hip hop need to fire spice she want to fight the girls is she jealous because she”s her  black or Spanish or write you still a pretty woman no body talk about color you do monkey is a animal you put the color on that name you make the all story so get over it
I would’ve run to my best friends 😂
They are all wrong and a mess. There somebody had to say it lol. 😂
Why spice so angry, maybe erica didn't talk to bambi about it because bambi is black to and thats an embarrassing topic. Spice got a nasty attitude for mo reason calling her a giraffe thougj lol. Bambi was calm so i don't understand
Spice had no right to blaze up on bambi like that,bambi was not th one who called her:)somebody getting too big for their breaches,im dissapointed,y u calling her a giraffe when u don't want to b called monkey,do into others as u want others to do unto u.,I guess it's a tour of th zoo then
Idk Spice annoying asf too tho
Somebody needs to slap spice. She's doing too much and running her mouth. She's starting a lot of mess and then mad when she gets a reaction. She's gonna catch it with the right person is she keeps up.
Spice always got problem with someone she is a bully I hate her
How is Erica Mena calling anybody a monkey when she married a black man with her half black children and she has black in her too so I don't understand just the ignorance is at an all-time high
She called her a giraffe but mad cause Erica called her a blue monkey 😂
Y’all mad 😂 she prolly don’t think Erica wrong
Spice gonna gather all these fake ass hoes👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Y’all all really don’t like Bambi for no reason  It’s weird
I mean bambi did hype spice up with that F word and her attitude..and  spice stood up and mayched that energy and Bambi calmed down real quick 😂😂
The Horse and all her hoofs got checked tonight - Spice been saying she's not the 1,2 nor the 3 so Bambi may think cos she get loud to Erica Dixon and Emani and talk to them like she above them Spice is the Queen of the Dancehall you can't talk to her like that and think she's not gonna pop off at you if you know Grace's upbringing and life you'll know she don't play especially with the Wicked Witches of the West - Bambi, Erica and Sierra and funny they ain't even friends like that no more their witch circle dismantled
Sierra built funny as hell😂
Mendeecee scratching his head like oh sh--
This is completely off topic, but Bambi cant rap. I mean, she really really sucks at it. Dam.
Did everyone forget Bambi called Erica Dixon "Wesley Snipes". She was always racist
I wish they cancel this show and these grown folks who’s willing to make a fool of themselves for a check
Spice not wrong! She know damn well Bambi has talked to Erica and she love acting like she don’t know nothing 😂 shit be annoying
Spice was checking the hell outta Bambi whole time 😂
Its rare to see Karlie not actually the centre of the mess and keeping out of it just doing a Mimi and eating that food unphased, its all Erica's fault this time 🤣
Why spice acting like dat? Is spice starting drama. she need to calm down I love her still she’s my favorite but she need to relax
Spice don't like that bitch word.. so when she call u bitch.... yes she mad mad
Why is Spice on Love n hip hop lol😅
Bambi is wanting to stay out of it, I think that's ok, spice already know what it is so forget them
Yandy look like B.Simone here
Spice was totally wrong for triggering Erica with her comment and at the same time Erica’s rage and disrespectful slur wasn’t called for at all!   Spice’s kids have been in Jamaica for a while now being raised by family members just like Erica’s son has. If, anything Erica could have simply expressed to Spice that they’re in the same boat but for Erica to call Spice a racial slur is unacceptable.   The difference between Spice and Erica’s parenting skills is that Spice continuously shows her kids that what she’s doing is for them so her kids understand the hustle and they love her. Erica’s son might have some resentment towards her so she’s triggered by the very mention of his existence due to the guilt that she has. If Spice’s comment wasn’t true then there’s no way Erica would have reacted that way. It’s like if someone says a “yo mommy” joke and you get mad at them at your big a** age even though the person has never met your mom. 😩😂
If Erica Fired Then Why Bring Up This Situation I Get It Eric Was Wrong But Its Like Instead Of Enjoying Dinner Yall Wanna Fuse & Fight
Sierra, you Bambi & Erica cackling on the couch, but you haven’t seen her in a while 🙄😒 Okay. PS, Bambi proud to calm herself an ex wife to Erica!! The first one he proposed to on tv. How you bragging about being an ex wife when you was a whatever in the hot tub with Benzino
Spice is lowering her status jumping up and fighting everyone.
"If SoMeOnE sAyS sOmEtHiNg AbOuT mY ChIlD, aLl BeTs OfF I say wHaTeVeR cOmEs To mY MiNd!" It says a lot that the first thing that comes to mind is a racial slur and that's the whole point that these fools defending Erica want to brush under the rug. Yall look tragic.
Why spice so aggressive like talk about things more civil you all are grown people
I just posted the other day. " I'm not arguing with anyone whose brain is the size of a chipmunk".... I don't care how mad I am, I'm not about to have a stroke proving my point..
Spice is doing to much
Bambi is an embarrassment she need to sit her butt down somewhere  spice spoke the truth which Bambi or Sierra can't  handle
Bambi is full of herself and doesn’t care about anybody but her
Both said some bs shit , like spice you made a judgement on a mother but Érica was wrong as well , but why spice so extra for tv
Spice is crazy, like the way she flipped on everyone associated with Erica.  Like spice is all abt the "no drama", girl please , mind your business nd stop getting into it.  Then you'd be drama free
Honestly Spice should just shut up and stop telling people they're fake, so what she ain't got to deal with them and she should think about her health. Not to mention she don't like the word bitch but used it real comfortably.
Are gone pass the fact Erica said spice should’ve died?
I’m confused as to why this is a problem🤔
Spice is annoying, Bambi doesn’t have to speak for Erica, okay she said it? What are they expecting of Bambi? Spice is annoying and entitled, race and motherhood are BOTH serious topics(playing devils advocate for a min) spice threw a low blow and didn’t expect Erica to go to hell. Erica is wrong too but what response were you expecting lbs? Ummm a LOW BLOW! But spices head grows more and more every season and it’s starting to not look good.
Spice went from a Dancehall artist who didn't sell records to a problematic Reality Star. 🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅Booooooooo
Erica was wrong spice was wrong but spice is giving wannabe bully and it's annoying
Yancy and Mendeece turned they heads at the same time.😂😂😂😂😂😂
Spice is aggressive, she always starting and trying to fight. Shes not the victim. (Plus) everyone talking bout a racial slur when she tried to bleach her skin because she wanted to be white. And the main thing is SPICE is not black shes Jamaican, so how she gon play the race card.
I would never defend no woman of a different nationality being disrespectful and races there is no apology there is no excuse she said exactly what she meant. And this is why Safari left her and is not interested in coming back with her 👀🆒🔙🔛👌🏼✨🥃📺🎥👀🃏🤡🤡🤡🔨 the spice also has to learn how to control her mouth and stop calling women female dogs. I say they just need to end this whole show. Let everybody go to your own way
#TEAMSPICE !!!!!
Can't focus with spice's wig looking like it came from party city. 🙄 spice is irritating and I don't feel bad for anyyyy of them.
I don’t feel bad for Spice or any of them. None of them are innocent. All of them say messed up things even ppl off the show. It’s not a good show never was or will showcase us in a good light b/c that isn’t what this show is for 😂 Just to save face they have to remove ppl from the show when they say certain things but it’s not personal it’s business. If y’all want to be mad at someone, blame them producers for endorsing a TOXIC SHOW WITH TOXIC/Toxic acting people. If people are looking for model citizens don’t look for it on L&HH let’s be fr.
This whole problem is really about self esteem issues on spice part … I can bet my last dollar spice called another woman ugly before , that she felt she was more beautiful then … Now that Erica is the more attractive one that called spice a monkey/aka ugly she feel so devastated and want to throw all black woman into her feelings… I bet every woman that feel some type of way have low self esteem problems and that’s why they feel attacked. I’m a beautiful black woman and spice don’t speak for me . I don’t feel no type of way on what Erica called spice. Spice said some mean powerful things about Erica and her child situation … spice was trying to dig Erica a grave but erica had a shovel in her 👠 shoe … 😂Erica put the nail in spice ⚰️coffin.
Spice said and dia what was needed. Cause how they trying to play in her face. Bambi looks and sounds stupid, your homegirl said some racist shit but you didn't ask her about it..chile bye oh lying ass
Yandy and Mendecee had me LMAO🤣🤣🤣
Spice wanted to talk to Bambi with her hands, lol!
Idc who u think wrong…spice u dont talk shit to ppl unless u wana get active idc how fake u think somebody is but to disrespect them idc what yal say spice do to much she think somebody suppose to kiss her ass
I use to like spice but not so much now a days cause she just do too much not because of these situations but her whole demeanor is gets crazier 🙄
They dragging this shit out okay she call her a blue monkey get over it the shit happen next and you can't be mad at ever fucking black person who don't want jump on the wagon and feel some way damn PS I'm black ass hell 😂😂😂
I LOVE SPICE. TALK TO THEM SPICE HAND THEM THEY AZZ
Bambi sat next to Scrappy at one of their reunions across from Erica Dixon calling her hair nappy and looking like Wesley Snipes. She sees nothing wrong because she's done it too
I’m Mendeeces to the bullshit lol
I love me some spice 💙💙
Spice be mean af all season. Idk why she expected that girls friends to back her. They would’ve been fake if they sat back and agreed with her.
Bambi, should say anything, its not a place. Spice want her to say something about erica.
All yall fake 😮
Don't you see ? They say SPICE CALLS OUT BAMBI FOR BEING FAKE 😳 LOVE AND HIP HOP ATLANTA.    SPICE THE LE*O SPREADS GGGGGZZZZHDDFJJJJKKK  AND THEY KEEP SPICE a rich "Duncehall" 😆artist.  Mystery solved. Thats why security always there.  Making money off of Le*o 🍑♌ SPICE.  Only she can perform. Le*o 💔💔💔👏🏿      🎤🎤🎤
Yandy always starting shit lol
It's possible those two may have thought that about Spice too and don't want it to be revealed.
And after all it is Sierra say Erica is no longer her friend and Bambi stop being her friend they don't play that whole crazy😂😂😂 and Bambi music is not hitting the only reason why she forced Scrappy to marry her to see if she can get some music
Bambi bucking up where was this  energy with Erica Dixon
SPICE NEED TO STFU WIT HER BIG BLABBING CRAP TALKING BIG HUGE A** MOUTH!! SPICE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE FIRED! N F GETTING FIRED, IF IT WAS SKY FROM BLACK INK CREW NEW YORK OR CHRISSY LHH NY, SPUCE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BEAT DOWN TO A PULP
What ep is this
Defending racism is crazy
The question 🙋‍♀️ why you so mad? Is ridiculous, Bambi as a black woman you don’t feel for a fellow black woman???? Too the point where you out here fighting and getting locked up with Erica!? Shameless face 😑
Us Jamaicans don’t play. We easily see right through red eye people
What I found interesting about the convo is that when spice said your son doesn’t like you .. Erica said who told you about my son? She didn’t deny it at all!
Did seirra just say they spoke with her after Bambi and her denied about speaking with her. Which it is honey. I hope karlie and spice get back friends bcus Sheikhna ain’t got no voice when it’s 2 on 1 but spice can handle herself. I don’t even know if I spelled her name right lol
calling bambi a giraffe after you was called a monkey is crazy
I don't like spice and i am black
Smh all i gotta say is watchout kicking someone wen they down idc if u been doing it for whatever amount of years 😂 as a woman 😜 u should know how men are cause we all know them tables 😂 ALWAYS TURN
Yandy or spice had no business asking them women nothing about Erica what was said was already said what could they have done spice coming now for everyone that's friends or affiliated with Erica that's supported everybody that's she thinks is close to Erica gonna have to be help accountable for the situation smh
Spice is annoying af to me popping off for no reason yes it’s wrong to use the race card but if someone makes comments about my child idgaf if the gloves r off any damn thing libel to come out my mouth no matter how offensive or evil oh well
Spice's feelings was justified at that moment, that's a racial disrespect and then you're talking in circles, girl..... friend or no friend you're black too.
I just feel like if you don't like me don't like me talk all the BS you want to about me. But when you mention my kid in any way shape form or fashion you  get what you get and if anybody can't understand that then I don't know what to tell you  Some people go high when others go low and some people drag their ass to hell where they want to be ...ijs
I personally feel like this is all stupid. Because my opinion, spice is wrong for just saying this things when she was around this 24/7 when they was all friends like 🤷. And maybe just maybe, Erica didn't talk to Bambi about some things because people tell you some truth but not all. But even still, why is that bothering spice because your problem is with Erica not Bambi or Sierra. I feel like she starting with people unnecessary.
Team Bambi
Calling any black woman a monkey blue black or otherwise for any reason is unacceptable. Accompanied with you should have died, says it all. Now had she got mad and called Bambi or Cierra a monkey they would be not acting coy like they don't know what's going on, it came out too quick, she truly feels that way.
Spice is soooo angry after her life was served
Normally, I cannot stand Shekinah, but in this particular scene, she was funny as hell trying to calm spice down by telling her don’t forget she earned the key to the region!😂 ha ha
They knew  right away .. c'mon now they so fake
This isn’t the Spice show. Like spice is doing to much
Everybody be mad at the wrong ppl .... Period
Bambi and Sierra KNOW damn well they don’t know how to be accountable let alone hold another woman accountable. That’s why they’re avoiding Erica.
I see both sides. Erica triggers are her kids, she knows she could have done better with her first child and it bothers her that her kid is not with her. Spice triggers are her insecurities being dark skinned and not fitting in the societal standards of beauty. We are all women at the end of the day. We all need to heal from our past traumas. FACTS
What difference would it make if that talk to Erica or not that didn't have nothing to do with that woman calling her a m word Erica a grown ass woman
Apparently now Sierra out the friend group , her n Erica fell out cuz they had an agreement not to bring something up on the show  Probably the safari contacting Sierra incident.  But best for Sierra cuz she might have got herself a mugshot along with the other two when they got into it with security at that club smh
Yea they fake they know they spoke to her. This crazy Spice whip they ass the tyte face squad. Lol. Spice did not talk about Erica son she came for her parenting only facts
Her calling Bambi a bunch of b s giving more then what's shown
ERICA DID THE FUCK NOT CALL HER A RACIAL SLUR just because she called her a monkey SPICE took that as racial, fuck spice she not innocent at all and this scene shows exactly that
It's soooo interesting how people keep justifying Erica's racial comment by saying Spice shouldn't have mentioned Erica's kid pertaining to her parenting (which is wrong) but nobody wanna mention how Erica brought up Scrappy's kids just a few weeks ago pertaining to him paying child support 🤔 Erica didn't call Scrappy a "Monkey" nor did she try to fight him especially when Scrap when bought up her kid.
Spice 🙄🙄
Horsy stfu you dont wont the smoke
I been on the Internet all day trying to find out why spice got a attitude with Bambi
Erica and spice are both wrong , it’s not right to talk about someone’s kids nor is it right to call someone racial slurs.
Spice going through something
So spice if you were talking about Bambi, why say you weren’t talking to her and you were talking to Sierra? Nah spice you should’ve stood on it
Listen, I’m black myself. So I understand it. HOWEVER, when you arguing and then you bring up a kid claiming that a persons kid dislikes them not knowing the back story to that or how triggering that may be for a person, you have to expect whatever you get from that. Wether it’s a table being flipped or a racial slur. Unfortunately some people don’t know how to that the higher road and so when you go low like spice did you have some people that go lower.  Erica’s bd is black. Friends are black almost everybody I’ve seen her on tv with was black so come on now let’s be real. Spice took a dig and so did Erica.
Le*o ♌ SPICE 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
👀bambi got defensive real quick 1:10 she always guilty of something 💀
Now Erica is half black and her kids are black too.  I think Spice is trying to be a bully now.  I don't care for bullies and I can spot them a mile away.
Bambi is full of isshhh😂
ITS YANDYS FAULT FOR BRINGING UP THAT TOPIC IN THE 1ST PLACE ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️ SHE SHOULD KNOW BY NOW THESE GIRLS ALL THESE GIRLS ALL FULL OF DRAMA 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You haven’t talk to your best friend~Spice 😂😂😂😂
I understand the situation. But spice thinks she can say & do what she wants. Na I'd knock her upside the head 💀💀
I never thought I would hear Spice say the word “bitch” 😅
I feel Spice completely
I love spice ❤❤❤
Go spice, they fake. Erica  is wrong 💯
Erica was out of line, but spice was too. She didnt have to throw the fact that ericas first son isnt really rockin wit her, especially when she was just tryna relate to spice on the single mother thing. Spice is becoming bitter and erica is the same old wit that spicy ass mouth
Spice needs to take it out on the one that said it or just stop talking to everybody she feels is fake. This couldn’t be me. Lol
Spice these days is a loose cannon and has a short fuse😳
Spice said “you haven’t talk to your best friend” 😂😂😂😂😂 0:33
I understand that spice brought up her son and that was a line that could’ve been avoided. But even so, when she mentioned it wasn’t like she lied, Erica’s son doesn’t like her. and for those who don’t know, the short story is erica basically chose safaree over he eldest son who warned her about him and expressed to erica that she shouldn’t have married him, but she did it anyway. And in doing so, has now got 2 additional beautiful children and divorced because she married a child that EVERYONNEEE has warned her about, even yo own son. Don’t hate us cuz spice told u to the bold truth, erica put herself in this predicament, I’m most def TEAM SPICEEE, cuz she keeps it all the way real
Spice fake ima male nd she made me stop watching this nd I love bitches lol
They are fake asl. Bambi lying for what g 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Spice acts really wild and untamed but I didn't sat anything smh 😮
It’s yandy and Mendeecee turning they head in sync for me😭😭😭
Who the fuck does spice think she is
Funny how Sierra said I told Bambi, Erica was dead wrong but neither one had that type of energy to the person that said it. Ain't no way in hell y'all talked to her and y'all didn't talk about that. That's the fake shyt Spice talking about. Erica has said that about her son multiple times which was also pointed out and stated by multiple other people on various seasons of this franchise. She only got mad when Spice said it because 1, she knows it's the truth, 2 because she already don't and didn't like Safaree telling Spice how she rolling for real and 3 because she knows Spice know how fake she is and called her out on it. Spice figured that out with all the shyt Safaree and receipts has told her. Again, she was also still being intimate with him not telling nobody about that but telling a whole story about how he ain't shyt. And honestly, what Safaree said sounds pretty accurate. They were working on them until she showed up with ol' boy in Mexico and according to Erica the timeline is correct. She confirmed they were still being intimate with each other the same time frame Safaree said they were. That's when Safaree said fuk it. Y'all caping for her is crazy.
Loose the blue an look different
I cannot stand Bambi at all
We're all a victim.  Our ancestors cannot even rest in peace to see that We're still fighting what they fought against for generations.
See its behavior like that, then when mfs react you wanna cry victim. Gtfoh. Bambi wasn’t even talking to her. She was made guilty by association, maybe she didnt want to be in that shit so she didnt want to admit she got the tea already……and sierra said exactly what i been thinking that Safari bitch ass is the shit starter in this situation.
Erica, Bambi and Ciara are probably banned from the island of Jamaica after this 😂
Spice is such a victim 🥱
Spice outta order
The way the others are just sitting at the table eating🤣🤣 That food must be hella good
She mad as shit😂
Spice does this all the time. Her and her insecurities. Bambi was talking calmly to her. Then when she says “Why are Y’ALL so fake” and when Bambi responds she plays victim. Smh she’s so ignorant.
SPICE called her fake.  Then attacked her in a cruel, mean way. Getting louder like she is right. Completely to brainwash this beautiful girl. Catch her off guard, by saying, "who are you talking to, Bitch am I not talking to you 👉🏿 Spice 🇯🇲🤮"
This seems like some pillow talk shit. Safaree is telling Spice this stuff and she going around spreading it. I'm bout sick of her. What Erica said was wrong but Hey don't bring up the kids cuz it can get very disrespectful
Spice is too hot and quick..she’s a bully
Spice, my Caribbean Queen!
The part I was shocked about was erica telling spice she should’ve DIED multiple times. The monkey comment was messed up ye but death isn’t sum to play with
😂😂😂now you wanna talk😂😂😂
Spice is to much this season
But you wasn’t talking too her , spice always starting shit
I don't know what it is, but I really don't like Spice either. She's also a sh$t starter!
I thought yandy was ny when they get to Atlanta
Not Spice calling Bambi a bitch. I thought she was so against that word.
Show me your friends and I'll show you who you are.
I'm kind of taken aback why MTV (Love and HIP Hop) took down the confrontation between Spice and Mena!  Anywho!  Here's the thing, Mena's son has been a hot button topic from the time she stepped foot on the LHH franchise.  She has been cold, luke warm or hot depending on how she responds when people mention him on or off camera.  Mind you this was a decade before her having children with Safaree.  At the end of the day, Spice was correct.  Spice has been a directly envolved parent with her children, for over fifteen years, while consistently and successfully pursuing a music career.  Leaving her country and children behind to push through a colorist, misogynistic, and ageist industry against all odds.   Meanwhile, Mena chose a different route of whatever she deems as a success, (cause I don't know where her music career started or stopped???) and was not or has not been active in her oldest sons life.  Birthing a child seventeen years ago, doesn't mean you have been an active parent for seventeen years.   The math wasn't mathing, and that's why Spice called her out on Mena's make believe timeline.  For Spice saying what she said and that fake triggering Mena is quite laughable.  Especially a few episodes prior someone from the cast mentioned her son. The pseudo outrage is exhausting.
Spice said “why y’all always being so fake” and then turned around and said she wasn’t talking to Bambi. Make it make sense. Spice is always relishing in her victimhood and doesn’t want to be accountable for her role in it. Girl grow up. It’s not Bambi and Sierra’s job to reprimand Erica for Spice’s satisfaction or to keep tabs on that dry a** confrontation. You’re not gonna walk away unscathed when you’re talking sh*t about someone’s relationship with their child, miss me with that.
Spice is doing alot here. I think it’s misplaced angr because she equates them to erica
Spice is taking the anger out on the wrong people. Bambi & Sierra didn't call you a monkey.
Can we let Bambi go as well ugh
And no one sees that Spice is angry and will lash out on every person she’s bitter from her recent trauma. Period. Not a victim. Just an unhealed woman. She needs healing not fights and no one is checking her for that? When you throw insults about someone kid don’t become hypersensitive when they lash back fights in the street don’t have rules. You cross lines expect the heat.
What i have for you safi .Is players always get played .
Spice is getting a lot of air time. Are they trying to get her a spin-off or something?
Spice is too much like just shut up sometimes
Yaaaasss SPICE! Call them clowns out to their face like you did.
I loooove Spice!
Bambi always acts like she just has no idea🙄
Can everyone stop and really think about this whole simple ass situation?! Erica wanted to discuss her feelings and anger about how Safaree, was more concerned with Spices health than hers! Erica was jealous and being vindictive, towards the wrong person! The only person she should be blaming and having a discussion with is Safaree! DON'T DRAG SOMEONE ELSE INTO YOUR DRAMA AND THEN GET BUTT HURT, WHEN THE MUD STARTS SLINGING! Spice should of never entertained that conversation, she should have referred her ass to her ex-husband!
Bambi so phony, she getting defensive because she know she lying, sierra is dumb too
Yyyeeessss get all tite face squad members 😂 let's go spicee
Im glad spice took up for the men
When you say what you say on national TV, it doesn't only affect the person you said it to. That is why it's deep. It affected, affecting and will affect an entire population.  This is not a joke. It's time we understand this. Period. We've been fighting against these things for too long and we should not thread lightly when things like these are said.
I’m tickled how Mendecee and Yandy both turnt their heads at the same time during the back and forth bs priceless!!😍😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Yandy and mendeece got me weak 😂😂
It's crazy Bam be protecting Erica and ended up arrested behind her stupid ass 😂😂😂
Bambi stay tryna act all mfn innocent with every damn thing, lil wanna be clueless messy ass… worrisome af. WE STILL AINT FORGET YOU IN THAT HOT TUB 🤣🤣🤣
Who the hell still watch this BS!
Why would she go back and tell u everything that’s her friend..why y’all still talking about it. She lame smh
This is what I can’t stand as a black person and this very issue that folks like Candace Owens be talking about. We are soooooo quick to say racial slurs about other folks but the moment anyone says anything remotely to us we immediately play the victim and expect others to tag along. Spice wanna play a victim and Bambi isn’t with that 💩.  We need to stop with the double standard and victim mentality.
1:50 ❤ HERE SPICE CALLING LADIES B B B B THAT MEAN SHE CALL THEM FEMALE DOGS 🐶🐕🐕.
If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything.
At this point spice doing to much like I understand the being hurt and upset but at this point you are antagonizing bambie like come on let her say what she gotta say.
Spice seems to be mad at everyone
Well did Erica lie spice is definitely giving money vibes yelling across the table 😂😂
Spice is a 🤡
Shekina got me crying laughing talking bout " tell her she just got  the keys to the Regent " 😂
They ALL WRONG PERIOD and you can’t pick which one is worse hurt is hurt all of this is annoying
Wow, these women di not know  or understand their roots. If you don't stand for something you fall for anything
Spice wanna act like a victim and be like oh we black so you need to be on my side. F**k off, Bambi is loyal to her friend and Spice is nobody to her. If Erica was my friend I would say yeah we spoke about it and that’s good for you.
Why would Yandy bring up erica name at the table knowing mostly everyone @ the table is mad at Erica for the racial slur smh they be knowing exactly wtf they be doing🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🙄
Ic stand Yandy she always bringing up some drama then sitting back when it pops off.
I think that spice must just leave Lhh cause it’s enough now… she’s too successful for this mess
Erica is the type of woman that can’t show accountability. So even if they did spoke to her about the situation , I’m sure she’s going to play victim. As a black woman I wouldn’t want to be friends with anyone who would stoop that low. This woman was on her death bed and for her to say “ you should have died” is crazy. Erica everyone knows your son doesn’t like you and isn’t living with you. You played a defensive mode and she still feel guilt about her son and that’s why she feels like she have to hurt someone else. Hurt people hurt people and she’s not genuine and need some serious therapy!
This is the SZN OF SPICEEEEE
She probably agree with Erica. We didn’t forget what she said to Erica Dixon.  They all pathetic I hope you will have the same energy for yt people this community is lost.  Protect black woman my ass yall just as colorist as the ennemy.
Spice is rude!!!!!
First of all wtf is spice so mad at everyone lighter then her insecure @ss
When the food wasn't tasting good and you have to find something  better to eat 😅😅😅😅.
Bambi ain’t hop up in Erica face at the table now she act big & bad wit spice
Is this a racial issue or a black woman issue. Erica like most latinos from NYC are viewed as part of the family. They ni**a this or ni**a that and no one bats an eye. Fat Joe was questioned by a radio host about his usage of the word ni**a and said i can do that cuz I;m that ni**a. Latino women call black and latino men ni**a all the time. No one cares. Latino dude calls a black man Gorilla ass looking ni**a, no one would have said ish. If Erica had called safari a bitch ass ni**a for leaving his kids or leaving her, that wouldnt have been a fireable offense. Its a racial slur if said by a white or asian person or european person, but she calls spice a blue monkey and now she crossed the line.  I'm lost. So this seems like a black woman issue, and with this termination black women let Erica and other latino women know she aint one of them even though they were fine with her saying ni**a in the past.  Because we know if it was Sierra or Bambi who called spice blue monkey face looking bi**h they would not have been fired. But the latino chick you allowed to say nigga to men, got fired because she said blue monkey to a black woman.
U gotta love spice though " oh u wanna talk now bitch"! Had me laughing loud like a fkn Hyena
Bambi the dear in headlights can’t fight and is fake as the diamonds she wears lol I’ll rather wear a gem then diamonds she wears Bambi I don’t hang with her period .. she nasty benzeno though.. not my type .. she not my type of friend
I’m sorry to say but Spice’s approach to conflict is not right.  She sets the mood and more often than not, the situation goes left.  I never see any accountability on her part either.😏
Spice. Go away
Spice want to be a bully.
Spice and Tokyo was the two most straight forward woman on the show ..I also see now why SPICE brought up in the pass the topic of , Colorists a couple of seasons ago ..Erica is Deplorable for this ignorant reacist comment... This is how she truly feels about Black people .. EXCEPT FOR WHEN SHE'S LAID UP WITH A BLACK MAN OH LET'S NOT FORGET HER TWO CHILDREN ARE BLACK WELL,WELL,WELL GET A LOAD OF BOZO 🤡
What is Sierra talking about? Safaree has nothing to do with the comments Erica made towards Spice. Her “friends” don’t want to hold her accountable.
Karlie was Mimi here fr quite and eating I barley noticed her.
I can't imagine living life like this. 💆🏽‍♀️ I know it's supposed to be entertainment but it seems very low-vibrational.
Yes Spicee
Bambi said too spice i have not talking to Erica about that why spice cannot understand that unstill she wants call bambi names Did bambi call spice out her name no but spice jumped in call her bitch about 12 times
Both spice and erica is wrong for what they said point blank period but spice is doing a lil too much her beef is with erica
If she don't talk to her about it she just don't talk to her about wah uno problem...uno ago push it dun her f**king throat fi say she talk to her...uno leave bambi alone man because all of a sudden she a get divorce all a uno dun pon her fi wah reason....when she was with scrap an everything good everyone did like her so what the issue with you hypocrite people
Lol spice directly calls them fake then says " bitch I'm not talking to you" girl u were .
Spice your doing too much and butch isn’t necessary always name calling isn’t acceptable and Erica was wrong for what she did but it did start cause safari and you kept dismissing what she would say or show you . Anyway respect each other  hotter and and Bambi has nothing to do with you and Erica
Well if that aint the pot calling the kettle black. So Spice just gonna act like she wasn't just on here running around with Karliee Redd messy tail self starting drama instigating gossiping throwing rocks and hiding their hands. 😂 Spice is a bully and folks keep excusing her behavior cause of this one recent incident between her and Erica.
Spice gotta stop. The show gotta stop...the reality is no one cares about the racial slur. These women be ready to cut a person kill them off and y'all worried about her saying monkey. Spice don't look like one but y'all okay with the violence these TV shows display
Spice can’t be mad because she’s not saying what she wants to hear from Bambi. Girl Iam over Spice.
Me in my Spice voice "you haven't talked to your best friend " I would say it just like that, because who she think she fooling. 😂😂😂
Spice…. 🛑 PLEASE! If she talked to them or not she ain’t got to tell nobody! Bambi is grown, please go heal and relax. If someone chooses to be FAKE that’s their choice, you can only control yourself! Which you can do by shutting tf up, respectfully
yandy started it.  Throws and hides after the mess is started.  Just like Rah Ali said.
Spice doing wayyyyyyyy tooo much. Way is her kids at or Jamaica
Spice needs to sit tf down...she's been messy AF since her Near Death Experience.   And to be honest, Erica should've called her worse for speaking on her kid.
Man y’all can only blame safaree for so much until it’s played out. Sierra just a dumb as Erica and Bambi. Is safaree a dead beat father who doesn’t do right by nobody? Yes. But what does Erica calling spice a monkey got to do with safari sierra? All this bad stuff happening to Erica is Erica’s fault and she need to take accountability for it. If you were Erica friend then you’d tell her how dead wrong she was.
Hello to everyone. I’m gonna play the devil’s advocate right now. Eventhough I think they were both wrong for saying what they said. My question is this: 1- Would it've  been ok if she had called her a blue elephant???? Or a blue whale??? 2- This is reality tv right?  so… in reality…don’t people say things they shouldn’t say when they are in a heated moment and then apologize when they cool off??? That’s REALITY to me. But again I repeat both were wrong cause both don’t know how the other would respond and say in a heated moment. THATS REALITY TO ME! MY SIMPLE POINION IS: Make her apologize and bring her back Because without her i don't think Safaree has a role on the tv series. Blessings to all🙏
Spice you can be messy a bit
Not Sierra trying to blame Safaree for what came outta Ericas mouth 😂
That's why I like spice on here because she made a space for darker skin women to come on theses shows cause Atlanta seems to be about light skin and thats it. I also like yandy being on the atl one as well. I noticed that a lot of brown women has bleached there skin to look lighter on theses shows.
I don't agree at all with what Erica said and if she was my friend I would check her. But Spice has been rude and nasty to the other ladies a couple of times and she always seems to get a pass. She was Erica's friend and yet she went to go play best friends with Safaree when she knows what he put her friend through. Yet when someone wrongs her, she wants the other ladies to stop being friend's with them.
She’s mad because you’re black and women. You should have her back and not the woman who went and racially slurred a innocent woman.
Lmao not giraffe I don’t see you 😩. Let’s just not name call 😂😂
Well Bambi deverse that and spice is definitely right about Bambi thats for sure x 🤦😬🤬🧐😳👎😤🤔🤔
But Bambi don’t have to tell Spice nothing! Erica is fired now! So why keep talking about it?! She gone!🤦🏽‍♀️ Spice is messy! They both should of got fired!
Every female at that table is over 30 an still fighting SMH..
Spice talks a lot of sh*t but she don’t really want no smoke, that’s why she suddenly wasn’t talking to Bam when Bam said what’s up. She needs to stop all the noise and sit down somewhere and be the dancehall legend that she is.
I wodve dropped erica as a friend asap. Cuz that was unacceptable
Bambi does not have to tell that blue monkey what her and Erica discussed, that's her friend and I'm pretty sure if the shoe was on the other foot she would have had her friend's back as well
Bambi Would Of Dog Walked Spice
The man that's F,ing with everyone's brain is no where to be seen but remember ladies before something can even start you need one person to start and safaree you did a darn good job at making all these women look like fools by involving them for no reason you have to be a man about your business and stop involving women Same to Erica stop speaking to everyone because people really do not have to be involved when there are two grown adults that can just hash things out for the sake of peace everything has gone to far and it needs to stop
Bambi responded appropriately. She asked who spice was talking to, and spice reacted as though she specified who she was talking to when she was taking to two ppl at once. Spice gets on my nerves more and more as I  watch. She's always on the defense about everything
Spice you need to calm down boo, you are just too hype.
SPICE IS TRASH
Spice, I understand same crap OG went through.
Spice is a bully
So it’s ok for spice to call Bambi a giraffe but when the shoe is on the other foot and she is being called a blue monkey, it’s now all of a sudden a taboo? The double standard is just hilarious to me. Spice brought out a Donkey at Sting to mock Macka Diamond based on her looks, isn’t that colorism, racism or whatever she names it today? Hiss teeth!
I find I crazy how spice doesn’t like being called a bitch but there she go sad
*Spice making they asses work for that LHH check!* 😂😂😂😂
Spice is just nasty period
Spice going ham on Bambi. I feel the energy is at the wrong person. This is sad a LATINA is dividing the community like this. Sad.
What’s funny is y’all are still watching this clown show this whole show is a joke
Not Yandy and her husband looking ↔️
Why isn't anyone speaking on that Erica also wished death on Spice, as a black woman, I have experienced racism and colorists ppl, and it's a horrible experience, bit to say that Spice should have died; takes the cake for me.
Bruh spice came sideways to tokyo, erica, and sierra. She getting her karma. & why u always addressing someone with a mediator? (Shekinah) & how u mad Bambi asked who u talking too, u just told sierra that YALL are fake.
Why is this channel posting stuff late and short🤦🏻‍♀️
bambi annoys me so bad.
YES AH SO MI LIKE IT
Sierra and Bambi...sit down and close those mouths that are always hanging open
I cant stand Bambi, but Spice with all that yelling and fake tuff sh*+ would get her facked up. She didn’t do all that with Tokyo when her and her ex bestie Karlie was being fake and Tokyo whooped her head.
I'm not buying that nonsense . Something so explosive Bambi didn't talk to Erica that's crazy .
Now u see why Erica called her that
It’s funny how Spice hated when Tokyo called her bch she said she hated the bch word but it FLEW out her mouth QUICK 😂 I love spice , but i don’t like how she acting
The phoniness is super crazy…. But it’s M and Y with the tennis match spectator heads for me 😂
Spice, you spoke that lady’s kids . You luck more wasn’t said.
Bambi and Sierra is fake , spice was correct when she said that shit . Oh and let's not forget about Erica . Sierra so quick to throw in someone else name (safari) and they want even talking about him . Like diamond said the plastic face girls , ain't nothing natural about none of them
Renni was so unbothered 😂
Fun fact is, Spice is way prettier than Erica. Let's be bff
Spice talking about she not talking to Bambi but she keeps saying y’all
Spice knew she was talking to Bambi too. Switched up real quick 😂😂😂😂
Love and hip hop is a zoo. Monkeys and giraffes ? Ridiculous
Erica was wrong as two left feet but Spice needs to calm down overall!
Tell em spice...
Here's my thing. For people to lie and say "Spice talking about her son" is really a trip. If anything, she taking up for her son because Erica already expressed since LHH New York that she didnt have a relationship with her son. For yall to say that it's like saying its okay to be an egg donor and racist. Erica shouldve been got fired.
Spice is dead wrong.
So its okay for Spice to call Bambi a horse but its not okay for Erica to call her a monkey? This outrage is a load of crap.
Renni tearing her food up😂
As a black woman calling another black woman a monkey using any type of racist words we will not be being friends ever.
I'm sorry, y'all can drag me in the responses if you want I ain't gonna read them, spice been in alot of drama this season, she even went on live and dragged Erica and called her everything and more, and because spice was called a monkey which lets be honest was probably Erica attacking her looks, now spice is the victim!!?? And I get it that term monkey has been used as a slurr against black people for decades and Erica as a Latina woman should know better, I get it!!! But spice is not a victim here so please stop!!
I ain't the biggest fan of Bambi but once again here goes spice attacking someone else first and then playing victim
#teamspice
Bambi talking like a politician lmao idk how she as a black woman is defending her so called friend
Cambie has became a scary cat
They all fake. Spice should just leave this disgusting show. U are worth way more and she has no true soldier by her side. Jealousy is in the air.
I think it’s time for spice to leave the show. It’s not a good fit for her brand. She’s way to good for it. These people are too fake for real.
Spice is honestly taking her anger out on people and tends to escalate an issue with her hostile approach. It’s like she’s always on go time and easily triggered. Even if she feels as sierra and Bambi are so called “fake” she doesn’t need anything from them and they don’t owe her anything so I’m just trying to figure out why spice appears so upset at them, them being fake has nothing to do with you. And I hate that she’s now starting to lash out on people because I can already feel how people are going to use that to justify Erica’s behavior. But the similarities in both altercations is spice irrational temper.
people keep talking bout spice dragging it if you get called a racial slur from someone who thought was your friend it makes you question your loyalty and little horsey anit no one coming for you because of your divorce  like scrappy said it takes 2 to marry and 2 to divorce.! 😂😗
I'm sorry but I just don't like Spice
Spice u talked about Tokyo body shaming her so why is ok for you to do it and not be held accountable spice to messy
Spice annoying asf cause wtf Bambi got to do with it
Spice is problematic SHES trying to control l&hh she threw Tokyo vanity under the bus Karlie red Erica and now Bambi she’s drama filled now u see why she’s the black energy in the cast she’s a negative Jamaican fool
I'm not feeling spice at all with the rage. I want to attack her friends because of what Erica said. They do not have anything to do with that. Your issue is with Erica, but you want to start beef with everybody who knows erica Stop it
What’s wrong with spice?She always angry and wanna fight everybody.Calling everybody fake but u fake too?Shes gets on my damn nerves
I don’t like Spice at all! A sneaky trouble maker!
So spice can call Bambi a giraffe but she offended Erica called her a monkey? 😂 sheesh
Spice is hot headed and has a victim personality. Once you bring up someones kids all decorum goes out the window. I woulda called her worse bout mine. Lets talk about it
I agree spice does need to heal from a near death experience. Secondly that karlie situation was weird, are we really going to deny that? Thirdly being called a racial slur when you questioned someone’s parenting not the child should not result in a racial slur. I think she needs time away from this show and to go to therapy.
Spice is doing it lot literally every scene she the one taking to the extreme
Spice is there she know
Yandy started
Trust me, I understand the situation spice & erica needs to go sorry
I’m sorry I like Spice. 😂😂 She the real deal Holyfield😂
I don’t like spice
Ok so Kirk takes them all on all expenses paid vacation and told them to act civilized!! And look what happens... This time Spice started it.... I'll just be Damned
Spice is not wrong. The black people that are defending Erica are ignorant just like Bambi. They lack self knowledge and history. Nothing justifies a racial slur especially because it stems from hatred and disregard For ourselves, the ancestors and the children that were victimized due to this mindset. We have to cut the head off the snake or it will slither through the generations. A monkey today is a baby fed to a croc tomorrow. We as a people can’t accept that or it will go to far. Everyone should take a stand against this form of hate no matter the race, it is inhumane. There’s a difference between inhumane and socially unacceptable. Spice said socially unacceptable things as perceived by many. But again that won’t justify the hanging of a pregnant woman and stomping the newborn released from her womb. The two don’t compare. There are bloodlines that cease to exist from this sort of hatred. And yet today we can discuss social behaviors over tea.
Giraffe 🦒???????🫠
Let’s just call like it is both spice and Erica were in the wrong period
Sierra trying to make that make sense will be a moment, always, in the worst way.  "We being mad about some shit Safaree actually started."  Girl...so Erica don't like black women cuz of Safaree?  It's laughable at this point.
Renni ain't miss one bite
So, everyone has to agree with Spice? Says who?
The racial slur was disrespectful but I also don't agree with spice bringing erica son into their augment and using what erica told her in  confidence as a friend about her family problems as a clap back...too me that's the most fake person...
Karlie 🤣😂 minding her business eating that food like ain’t nothing going on at the table lol
Spice is obsessed with Erica.
People been getting rowdy on this show since day one has everyone forgotten Joseline, Tommie cursing and fighting everyone? So I’m confused why people keep bringing up spice attitude. I’m not Jamaican but from what I can see spice just gives it to the cast raw unfiltered truth and they can’t handle it. Case is point instead of Acknowledging That Erica is a racist they try blame safaree for Erica recklessness? Ermm did safaree tell Erica to call someone a blue monkey and make monkey noises? I think not. This cast has gotten way to comfortable and they need to go and usher in new blood. What does Bambi or sierra bring to the show? Nothing. Getting rowdy calling each other bitches yada yada is expected what’s not expected is a non black Latina hurling racial insults at cast mates. Spice to me looks pissed of because she tired of the excuses. It’s disgusting how some black people love to coddle this non Afro latinas who only associate with us because they can’t pass for white but exotic enough and light enough to be put on pedestal by own community. We are own worst enemy. Trust me if you’re racist to me the beef is on forever including whoever else sided with you. Erica isn’t accepted in her own ethnic group that’s why she had lackey like Bambi and sierra trust me would drop them in a heartbeat for her fellow light skin latinas.
That food must have been good AF lol
Spice lately is just too much. I like her but lately I'm cringing on all her hyped scenes
Idc what nobody says Spice is always hostile and disrespectful in her tone & delivery so whether Bambi or Erica turned up on her it was justified. Bambi sat there peacefully said her peace and then got called fake & called out of her name. Then afterwards when Spice clarified she was talking to Sierra, Bambi sat back and shut up. Then when Spice said they both were talking to her, Bambi went to clear it up and immediately got called out her name again. Then Spice proceeded to try and fight her as if she didn’t just have a death scare. It’s like no matter what happens she doesn’t see that she needs to calm down and humble herself instead of turning up and immediately trying to fight and spread negativity. A lot of y’all backing what she’s saying and doing because y’all act the same way and y’all are stubborn and closed minded and so hell bent on Erica being racist and it’s sad. Y’all really need to take a step back and look at the whole situation, Erica compared them because they have many similarities and are easily comparable, Spice said that she feels like Erica feels she the first woman to be divorced with 2 kids that’s not something she came up with on the spot it’s something she’s been waiting to say. Erica again made a valid point shes being doing it 16 years while Spice has been doing it 14, and yes Erica definitely wishes she can get the time back she lost with her son but that doesn’t make him an open subject especially after y’all all know he don’t want to be in the limelight something Spice would definitely know because they’re friends. However Spice having to get the one up then says “yeah, with your son who doesn’t like you”. After her child who doesn’t want to be in the limelight is spoken on by her friend who knows that, all bets are most definitely off, the monkey comment is out of line and disrespectful but in an argument you don’t aim to be respectful you aim to hurt. And even in this situation Spice Is mumbling under her breath already on negativity before the discussion can start it’s like she always on bs and it shows but everyone wants to be blind because “Erica is racist”.
Thank U Spice check them Fake Ass B***hz.
ERICA SPECIFICALLY STATED HER SON DOESN’t WANT TO BE SEEN OR INVOLVED OR ON THE SHOW. TEEN SUICIDE IS HIGH. EVERYBODY ON VH1 & LHH should be sued for allowing the cast to harrass and stalk a minor aged child after the CUSTODIAL GUARDIAN SPECIFICALLY TOLD EVERYONE HER SON WAS NOT ON SOCIAL MEDIA & DOESN’T want to be involved. SHE STATED HER SON WAS VERY SENSITIVE OVER THE TOPIC & YET EVERY YEAR SOME CAST MEMBER TROLLS THE CHILD & HIS MOTHERS RELATIONSHIP FOR THE CHILD TO BE BULLIED AT SCHOOL OVER DOMESTIC & EMOTIONAL ISSUES.
The black people in these comments defending Erica are the weakest links and why the black community can’t thrive. If the only insult you can resort to is racism then you’re a racist periodt
I’m starting to not like Spice
She has way too much energy for them I didn’t see this aggression with Erica spice be all bark 😅
dont black spice have medical situations now you trying to fight bambi butttt aint spice then one being fake first about karlie redd
This scene upset me i love spice but if the girl said she didnt talk to Erica about that then give her the benefit of the doubt she wasnt bambi wasnt coming for spice at all. She definitely overreacted and then when bambi called her out on it she said i wasnt talking to you.. like well who was you talking to then babe????
Spice can't never have a grown conversation
YO MENA SHOULD SUE VH1 & LHH for ALLOWING EVERYONE TO HARASS & STALK HER MINOR AGED CHILD WHO ISN’T EVEN ON THE SHOW. A WEH DEM A LOOK FI HIM FA?! SUICIDE AMONGST TEENS IS HIGH RIGHT NOW
THEM HEFFAS IS FAKE....BAM, SIERRA AND ERICA....OLD TIGHT FACE BIRDS
SPICE FROM U DON’T KNOW A THING ABOUT CHILD SUPPORT U SHOULD NEVER SAY ANYTHING. JAMAICA NEVA COLLECT CHILD SUPPORT. PURE DEAD BEAT FATHER U HAVE SPICE. From SAFAREE PAYING maybe $4k a month. Multiply by 3 months late. Imagine him owing $12k in child support but he buy a thot some rolexes. IDIOT GYAL. Mena should be angry. LOCK UP HIM BBBBBLLOOODDDDDSCLOTH NEXT TIME HE DON’T pay for him children!
SPICE NEVER MARRIED, SPICE LEFT HER 2 PICKNEY IN JAMAICA WITH HER MOOMA, YET SHE SAY SHE DO IT ALONE! IDIOT GYAL U ANUH ANY BETTER THAN MENA.
Spice is wrong because ofc me and my friend probably talked about you sis, but that’s not your business tf lmaoooooo ! You don’t like her and that’s not my business either.
ERICA BEEN TOLD US HER SON IS SENSITIVE & doesn’t want to be mentioned or SEEN. THIS IS HOW KIDS END UP SUICIDAL. WHO IS SPICE TO BRING UP ERICA’S 1ST BORN. U R WRONG!
So let me get this straight Erica say blue money she racist … Spice calls another black woman giraffe she isn’t racist  Spice wants to bleach her skin into a white one she isn’t racist  I guess black people cant be racist double standards are ridiculous
Bambi is a bird But I'm Mendeecees and Yandy here switching head side to side while eating and enjoying the drama
I am disgusted at these women 💯💯💯💯 I hope they get hate forever fr
@loveandhiphopatl Spice has got to go!! She is a big bully!! This is unacceptable!! Bambi didn’t do anything to her!! Kick spice off the show! We will not be watching it no more!!
There's an unwritten rule on reality shows when it comes to women arguing that you don't bring up a woman's child, that is absolutely off limits. Now Erica calling spice a monkey and wishing she had died was cruel and uncalled for. But Erica has a reputation for hitting way below the belt. She makes Marlo Hampton look like a classy lady by comparison. But Erica is one of those people if you try to cut her with a butter knife she's gonna try and take your head off with a machete. So as wrong as Erica was, Spice knew how volatile Erica can be and should have known better to personally attack her.
Renni eating enjoying the show 😂
They were being fake. Even the answer was fake. 😂😂😂😂
iʼm so happy spice checked her, yes girl check that bitch!
As women we know that talking or bringing it up in anyway of kids is code u just don’t period.
SAFAREE & SHEKINAH started the ffffkkkryyyyy. Safaree need storyline so he threw the mother of his children under the bus. Shekinah gladly took info and instigated at Spice event.
Mendece and yandy so funny
Spice take accountability I brought her child up FIRST
Foreal it's serious foreal😐😐😐😐😐😐
Erica NEVER said any racial slurs. She CALLED SPICE A BLUE HAIRED MONKEY BBL Bishhhh. She talked about how the BBL almost killed her & went low to say she should have died. There’s been ongoing memes about the GORILLA BBL & Spice has had more than 1. GOOGLE it… https://i.redd.it/tmio7ciq2l681.jpg  IT IS ABOUT WOMEN WHO LOOK WORSE AFTER PAYING THOUSANDS ON SURGERY. BIG LINE BACKER GORILLA BODIED BBL BISSHHHESS 😂
Spice is doin way too much
😂😂😂 Karlie the new Mimi eating her food unbothered 😅
Spice such a bully
Bambi is a colorist herself she called Erica “Wesley Snipes”, a woman who looks better than her on her worst day. Next.
Absolutely disgusting black people doing anything for money.
Spice is the only fake one here!! Big bully!! She should get kicked off the show to for going after shekinah, Mira, Carli Redd, Erica, Bambi, Sierra!! She jumped Akbar too!! Big bully!!
It really shouldn’t matter if they still friends or not. That didn’t have nothing to do with them girls, she need to keep her aggression with Erica. We can play the black girl to black girl card all day let’s play the accountability card
I'm sorry but Bambi need her booty cheeks punched on. 💯😭
I cannot stand spice she is 40 something years old and need to grow tf up!
Shekainah is hilarious😂😂 whispering “You got the key to the region” 😂😂😂
Spice this is what Tokyo was saying 🥱Fake
First time that I would pay to watch this season, it would be worth it 🤭
Why do people get so offended by being called a monkey! I’m black and I don’t think being called a monkey is racist. Yes it’s cruel and disrespectful but racist I don’t know about that 🤷🏽‍♀️
Bullshit Spice plays the victim role too much
Erica called her a BLUE monkey not a black monkey.  I can't stand Spice anymore. She should never have spoken on Ericas mothering or her son! Since when is there rules for that type of disrespect?
AHHHHHHH sometimes it just gets overwhelming and so unbearable like damn MAN🙄🤨🤣 but like foreal it's serious though
Why spice didn’t get fired for fat shaming Tokyo?? She a walking contradiction. She hate being called the B word but look at her. Y’all this a setup. Erica was the sacrificial lamb.
Spice looks like a clown!😂
We all know that Erica's big mouth couldn't wait to tell Bambi about Spice talking about her son and how that was off limits. Stop lying, Bambi!
Idk who tf Spice think she is, but uummm🤔 how you mad at them cause they didn't have to tell you who they talked to about anything. 🤷🏾‍♀️ They were actually beings fair. & AGAIN,  AIN'T NOBODY BOUT TO SAY ANYTHING F'D UP TO ME & THEN TRY & TELL ME HOW TF TO RESPOND!!!🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️ #NOMaamNoHamNoTurkey tf🙄
I don’t like Erica or Spice. 😂😂😂😂  Spice is a bully and she came at Erica very aggressively and out of line, in comparison to the conversation at hand. Then, she comes for her parenting…for NO GOOD REASON.   Erica, even though she had every right to be  very mad…calling a black woman a blue monkey was completely out of line and racist. She was very wrong too.
SMH it’s ashame how y’all just brush pass spice bs! Tf are you mad at her friends when not downing her how YOU want them to! Spice can talk to ppl how she want but soon as someone match that energy now she hop up screaming saying “who tf are you talkin to” if theyre telling you,she didn’t tell them everything tf are you mad about? You can’t get disrespectful to someone and when they say some disrespectful sht back then say “watch how you talk to me” like no that’s not how that sht work! I don’t like spice I feel like she’s a bully!
i’m sorry i like spices musics but she irritates me 😒 girl shut up u been mad pick me all season ✌🏼
FAKE AHHHHHHHH it's overwhelming like omg! Damn man damn🙄🙄🤣
Yandy and Mendeecees unison head turn 😂😂😂😂
Bye spice
My only thing is, they can run up on men and scream and cuss at their faces sticking up for “what’s right” but they can’t stick up for what’s right in this situation? Friends are supposed to hold each other accountable.
Y'all gonna go off on me tho I definitely agree that Erica was wrong in what she said!! But I honestly can't stand Spice literally can't stand her. Even if Bambi is flexing and she talked to her sooo? Why do she owe spice anything? She probably lied if she lied to stay out of it because either way it go Spice was gonna ha e a problem with what she said. Smdh
This is some straight B.S.  Erica shouldn't have called her a Blue Monkey/Monkey But was triggered when spice went low and said, "the kid that don't like you" and "My kids like me".  Of course, those words are going to spark a response.  Females through low blows all the time when there mad at each other on these shows.  We've been watching this for years.  If erica was black and called her a blue monkey, I really doubt it would have been an uproar like it has become.  To me, erica came in and started off sincere and apologetic and spice was already ready to pounce.  But in no way, shape or form do I feel erica is racist.  Shes been on reality TV for years and seemingly cool with a lot of black friends, black boyfriends, black husbands & finances and now half black children.  One-word doesn't make her a racist.  She was 1000 percent wrong in saying Blue Monkey and lost her gig because of it.  But spice aint no victim.  And don't let me get started on Shekinah. She always starting shit but aint never got no man herself.
Nowadays its u cnt call a black person nmonkey when it’s alot of ppl that’s pure ugly n looks like one ppl give words to much power wud it been different if she called her a walrus if I’m heatn someone and I think they looks like a monkey then I’m a say it that’s goes for black men or women and I’m a black man  It could b a white woman or man if u gun someone it is what it is
Spice is a trouble maker !! 😊
Bambi is fake
Even tho what Erica said was OUT OF LINE… Spice SHOULDN’T HAVE spoken on her child!!! PERIOD!!! Regardless to what Erica said about it HERSELF it’s NOBODY’S place to throw it in her face behind some shit dealing with a NO GOOD MAN!!! We can all have our opinions and our comments but if the shoes were on your feet you would’ve came for her neck as well so let’s all stop the bullshit! And this is coming from a DARK SKINNED BLACK WOMAN! I don’t like what Erica said AT ALL but I do understand how it feels when somebody tries to use your children to hurt you so I understand that Erica was equally trying to hurt her.
Spice is right
Sorry but I have to call BS with Spice. She used info told to her in confidence to one up another woman who was upset that her husband cared more about his homegirl than his wife. That's crazy. Safaree was WRONG for sharing that with Spice. Then Spice turns against Erica and teases her by comparing the mother/child relationships "MY SON LOVES ME!" Spice was bugging out and now she's picking with people that DON'T OWE her an explanation. She started hollering, name calling, and being terrible. This is my last season with LHH. It's been fun! ✌🏾
Spice is doing to much saying B this B that but the moment someone tries to step up to her they are in the wrong ?
Yandi && her husband heads turning had me weak asf 😂😂😂😂😂😂
She called her a monkey because she’s not Cute!! No because of race, y’all stupid. Y’all act like us as black people own the word monkey, who the hell claims that. Yall are so damn weird. Talk about my child in any way instead of positive. Ain’t nobody safe
Spice is so aggressive ununnecessarily.....face erica, not her friends.
I don’t care what nobody say you throw rocks but hiding your hand. Erica called Spice a monkey and spice was vex and mad but she can turn around and call another black woman an animal and there no problem. Spice was always the problem I’m not saying Erica was right but Spice is a very scary person. She cry and got vex being called an animal but call another black woman and animal.
Can't wait the reunion 🤣😂
Honestly the original Atlanta crew made this show. It’s just not the same .
Mendeecee and Yandy😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sierra already said she told her everything, but the monkey part. I'm sure she told Bambi too and left it out. Just say she didn't tell y'all that part. They are fake.
Spice head hot🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Erica is not a racist.. if she is one then we all are racist because I’m sure y’all tongues has said derogatory things whether it was public or not.. it was meant to hurt Spice not to offend her race… Erica is in love with a black man and has 2 black kids… to be a racist would be to hate her own babies which we have seen how she reacts to people speaking on her babies.. y’all some clowns
Y’all are real phony for invalidating Spice’s feelings when the whole thing started bc Erica wanted to say she been a single mother for 16 yrs vs Spice’s 14 yrs as if it say 14 years is nothing as a single mother. I do feel that Spice wasn’t wrong bc at least her kids like her 😂. Like how are you gonna brag about being a single mother for 16 yrs when your kids don’t like you
Spice: “Why y’all so fake?” Spice: “I’m not talking to you?”  Then who the fck is y’all?
Erica probably did talk to Bambi but she probably leave out the racial parts. Ppl usually change the story to make themselves look better. Probably called Bambi like “spice talked about my kid 🥲” looking for sympathy not to take accountability.
Fuck up dot spice!!!😂
If I were Spice, I wouldn’t talk to any of these people 😂😂😂 None of them would disturb my peace! The enemy is real busy
remember bambi also went to jail for the same woman calling other black women monkeys...man bambi is one good house n word.
Bambi is just like Yandy. Don’t never know nothing. 🤣🤣🤣
Spice wig omg 😂
" You wanna talk now Bish "?  I'm #TeamSpice, after yo Afro latina bestie called me a Blue Monkey u mean to tell me you gone sit in my face look me in my eyes and say y'all didn't discuss that yet?  Miss me at the b.s.!
At this point… I’m over spice.. she has always been an issue..
Yes renni I really only watch the show for her now we need more of her ❤ she that bitch
Spice is not innocent she had had her share in being a nasty, vile person. They all wrong.
Erica has said worse about peoples kids and mothers. Also others on the show have as well. Yet spice is called a racial slur this time? Erica tried to pull a fast one and her true persona was revealed. During that convo it was revealed that Erica used to brag about how Safari doesn’t like or date black women and I truly believe Erica found comfort in that. Now that Safaree is dating a black woman (Amara) and showing and expressing how much he cares about Spice due to her recent medical scare, Erica has had the rug swept from beneath her feet and now she’s lashing out as white women tend to do when the world isn’t bowing at their feet.  She grew up believing she was always the first pick as a Latina with fair skin… And that black men in particular would do anything to have him a Latina. Calling Spice an international Grammy nominated artist, a monkey had more to do with putting Spice  in her place as a black Jamaican woman so that she could reaffirm the racist anti black position she was told she would have over women like Spice. Spice has the career that Erica was promised! But karma is karma….. Erica is just getting hers rn!  Moreover, Erica has f*** over a lot her friendships to be with Safaree. Including her friends that once used to date Safaree. Isn’t that breaking the girl code?  She’s nothing but a spicy Karen who invades black spaces for coin bc she knows y’all love some good fake black Latin teas. Especially y’all black girls who consume and fake proximity to Latin culture to escape your blackness. But the way Erica (a Puerto Rican and Dominican) spoke to Spice (Afro-Jamaican) is exactly how fair skin Latinos speak to Afro Latino and Afro Hispanics all the mf time. It was racist then and it’s racist now!
Although I am Sicilian, I am able to fully comprehend, that the disgusting, vile, derogatory and racist venom that spewed from Erica's mouth, has nothing to do with anger, with feeling insulted or hit below the belt. A person either thinks and feels those things about another race, in order to even say those sickening things or they don't. Those vicious racist words wouldn't even cross a persons mind to use as ammo against another race, unless the person is a biggot. There are multiple examples of Erica referring to black women, black men and black children in very racist, derogatory terms, do those examples also get a pass?? There's zero excuse and Erica does not deserve to be let of the hook with a slap in the wrist but instead held 100 percent accountable, be fired and knocked of the platform she'd built by riding the coattails and using her black cast mates.
Lets see if people still care in 3 months.  A show that makes money off black womens pain. This girl called a grown woman a monkey and Bambie has the nerve to get mad at Spice. Go put your blonde wig bavk on and go be Ericas puppet. They also blame these men that they choose to breed with like stop embarrassing yourself.
Spice you are being so pitty right now, grow up Bambie was not the one you got in a fight with. Leave Bambie out of it. I don't understand why people think it's okay to put people in between shit. Like leave me the hell out of it . I can be friends with anyone and everyone. Spice you need to get over it. You are beautiful, successful, you have fans who look up to you. Girl let that stuff go. And move on let Erica be the miserable one point blank..
And why Spice isn’t fired yet either after calling Bambi a giraffe
Ladies we got to do better. I’m totally disgusted with this. It makes no sense to keep making yourselves look bad. Please think 🤔 before you strike! We must do better!!!
Erica was wrong as hell..but Spice did The Same Thing at this table that she did at that table with Erica…She went from 1 to 5000 in 10 seconds…It looks like Spice wants Smoke with damn near everybody….
Spice annoying asf
They be letting Spice punk them. Yes Bambi lying you can’t tell me you and Erica haven’t had no conversations about what happen. What happen to the bad azz Bambi that was on basketball wives! Or do she gotta have Malaysia by her side to be tuff. Because the way Spice was calling her call type of  btches is insane. Damnnn bam ain’t did sht to you.
Nobody did nothing to spice at this table but it’s ok for her to call mfs out they name. Like spice is a nasty person n needs to go she brings terrible energy!
Spice is just rude this is why she was called a monkey
Spice has come into this season with a lot of hate and venom for sure. Erica was wrong as HELL and deserves to be fired! But, so was spice. It seems as though you did not learn from nearly dying to be a better human being. All I see is a woman on the brink of losing it...  First Karlie... You know what NVM, let me mind my tax bracket 🙄
Erica and Bambi in the bitter ex-wives club
Spice only got what she deserves if all these ppl so fake why would you want to be in there presence. I think she just trying to throw her way around on them girls. But didn't like when Erica called her out her name but here she go calling Bambi out her name. You ever thought about they don't want to do the he say she say bs.
Spice need that ass whooped
Now spice is doing too much what goes on with the other ladies and Erica doesn't have anything to do with her no one can stop people from being friends with anyone  why would she stop being friends with them just because of Erica I hope she comes down before it makeshift to her looking bad
Spice "I don't see you Giraffe" 😭😭
She is the problem, she jumping up acting like a money
So y’all ignoring spice being disrespectful spice is nasty
Bambi know she talked about that situation with Erica. THE LIES THE LIES THE LIES!
I’m sure this is all a set up. It’s “entertainment” although i don’t find racial slurs/ talking about peoples kids entertainment but i’ll say this. You cannot say something about someone child and think they not going to react and to say Erica went far is a stretch cause all bets are off when you speak on my child. Was Erica’s comment ignorant Yes! But Spice bringing up her child was ignorant & wild. So in that moment Erica said what she said. Both of them were wrong!!!!
Shekinah looking beautiful 😍
Spice saying Erica's son doesn't like her didn't turn her into a racist. She was always a racist. She called Spice a monkey, twice and even proceeded to make monkey noises.
I am not an Erica supporter. I am tired of Spice and her antics. She should become a boxer. If I had a near death experience, I would want to be with my loved ones.
Spice need to go sit down worry about that bs music 😅 spice was definitely wrong
SO SPICE CAN CALL BAMBI A WHOLE GIRAFFE AND NO ONE SAYS A WORD?! Lol
Im all for accountability. PR with a black son. Some shit dont need to be said. That was a Hell No. How ever since we r here to hold ppl accountable. Where was the same energy for Spice when she was body shaming Tokyo.? I'll wait. She aint no fkn better
I’m screaming and mandeeces and  Yandy heads both turning at the same time lol
I’m literally over the downgrading of melanated women period on these reality shows. Racial slurs aren’t ok and neither is calling women’s Bi!ches! It’s so bad that y’all even accept this behavior from the lgbtq plus community. I get tired of hearing and seeing the nonsense! Nothing positive, just low vibrational! I won’t continue watching ✌🏽
Spice is absolutely beautiful. Erica is dead wrong. It's That simple
Spice is doing the most making herself look ridiculous
Yeahh spice !!!!!
Them ratings about to drop like before
Yeah spice was 100% correct on this that sht is not cool 🙄🙄
These old ladies still arguin lol
Spice.. get off the show. Looking all types of mess now and your kids don’t deserve that.
Spice, ok you have a Grammy, so? Sit down and move on. You are not that woman
Well Spice don't understand what loyalty look like in a friendship that's why she so confused. Good job Bambi
I love spice 💕
This is so had to look at because these black beautiful barbie fighting. Erica Mina was wrong fore calling  spice a blue monkey 🙊. Erica needs to make a public appearance and Apologize to spice
Spice is full of it herself. She is a shit starter. No she didn’t deserve the racial slur, but she is not innocent in all of this. Spice can go too. Fire her azz too.
As a black woman I hear  Friends Family  Associates  Enemies  Etc etc Say all types of racial slurs  Come on now let’s stop it I’m giving the same energy to that situation as I do all the others  It ain’t my business 🤷🏾‍♀️  Why because I don’t stop others from saying crazy shit now all of a sudden I’m Shero to the BLACK WOMANHOOD 👀  Everyone in the comments  “If my non black friend”  But would allowed “black friend” to say racial slurs is crazy as hell
They were being so fake like come on
Not Spice just called this black woman a Giraffe. A bit of hypocrisy. I’m a black man and I’m on Spice side but I’m not here for her calling another black woman a giraffe.
Spice is annoying always starting shit.
Sierrra it’s blaming Safaree. 🤦🏽‍♂️
Honestly, I feel like they’re both wrong, and not only that Spice is the one that brought up her son First kids are off limits to begin with secondly even though Erica was wrong in what she said she was just angry about her bringing up her son which I don’t blame her.
When I seen that Spice became a part of the cast, I knew it was a matter of time she’ll be kicking off with the other females 😂
Spice is mad that she was called an animal then goes on to call Bambi a giraffe. Spice repeatedly complained about not calling her a b*tch and then calls Bambi one first. We’re not going to act like Spice isn’t a problem. (This doesn’t excuse Erica’s actions, I’m just tired of people looking over Spice’s bad behavior).
THIS STUPID SHOW MAKES BLACK WOMEN LOOK TOXIC💯✌️
really don’t understand where this storyline is going anymore this show starring to get real tiredt 🥱
Nobody was at right but Spice should careless if Bambi did speak to Erica cause at the end what is speak between them was private. If Bambi choice not to share if she spoke with Erica about the situation then let it be. At no time did Bambi was defending Erica in the who argument. And I am not a Bambi fan…
Mendeces, Yandy, & Renni just eating looking back & forth while they arguing got me hollering 😂😂
Naw what I talk about wit my  bestfriend is none of your business. Spice anger is toward the wrong ones. Period
Spice is no victim. She’s the aggressor. Save all that other bs 🥱🥱🥱🥱 can’t play ball, don’t throw one
shekinah is so funny telling her she got the keys to the region sit tf down😭
“ I don’t see you” tell her Spice !!
I’ll be so Damon glad when Bambi knock a hoe head off cause they’re getting more disrespectful
Lmao 🤣
Idgaf I’m with Spice. They always wanna be fake and act like she didn’t talk about that situation with Erica. I cannot stand Bambi. Sierra is coo but Erica could’ve called her anything but a monkey.
Spice started shut though
There Yandy go again…. Starting a war, then running away to see the mess she made unfold. She’s a master manipulator and that’s why she’s on every season and every city of this played out show. Ain’t people tired of seeing these grown @ss 40 year old women brawling like they ain’t got no dang sense!?  We’ll continue to see our communities suffer if we use these people as examples.
Bambi said “wtf you talking to?” Then surprised that Spice popped off. Bambi and Sierra are fake because there is no way Eric didn’t call them immediately about that situation.
I would throw that entire table at her blue 🙉 *ss again
And that exactly why she got called a monkey
Random; I love how spice really loves the color blue!! 💙🩵🤎✨️
I'm a little bothered by Bambi and Sierra's reactions by this situation they are not bothered by their Latino friend calling one of their own a monkey but I bet if Scrappy's Erica ever calls Bambi a bytch oh she will be ready to fight along with Sierra tagging along
If one black person calls another a primate name…is that racism? I know Erica is Latina, but just curious if it counts, if they are also black and actually think they look like one?🤔
I’m not fina act like spice isn’t messy
HOLD UP ⬆️ ‼️‼️‼️ ERICA WAS WRONG BUT let’s not forget how spice treated Tokyo last season when she was fat shaming her and she even called Her a OCTOPUS 🐙
A black woman walking around with blue hair pissing ppl off subject to be called anything in a heated argument rs
Spice is wrong often but she’s right here. No one wants to hear the deflections about “work” or Safaree. Why is your friend calling dark skinned Black women monkeys? Stay on topic. Trying to start a fight so you can distract everyone from the fact that you’re okay with being friends with that racist.
Everything is a fight with spice 🙄
I don’t like Bambi but I’m sure that issue is the last thing on her mind with all her baby father drama. There was no need for that from Spice. I love Spice but not everyone is thinking about Erica and Safari and her mess
I don't know but Spice is provoking people all the Time and playing the Victim .. And that Actitude Goshhhhhh. Are you not tired ???? Don't forget she used to call Tokyo also names and make fun of it.
Remember when spice didn’t like when Tokyo use to call her btch now she calling everybody a btch. Remember when sierra use to get on Tokyo about eating fatty foods now she got a cookbook with nothing but fatty foods
I'm so #TeamSpice
This season spice started with almost everyone. First Karlie then after meda her best friend and almost with shekina and there after she went for Erica but Spice can call Bambi giraffe on her looks but Spice cannot be called after what Ericasee in her face because of her act!? Well. For real Sierra is black and others too sitting at the table but they don't looking like M..... So it's not about the colour it's about the look a like... Because kirk doesn't look like M..... But Spice act and does work as a circus animal for the industry of hollywood being as a...... With blue wig
"You haven't talk to your best friend?!" 😂Spice a real one 💯
When just brittany called erica "taco tuesday twin" they were all quiet but now that the roles are reversed they wanna get mad fr😂
Bambi and Sierra talking to Erica about what she called spice what was that gonna do the woman said what she said wasn't shit they could do about it
Spice did too much. And Spice going hard for that man like she with him or something relaxxx she popped off and Bambi never gave her that energy
Did she call Bambi a giraffe?
But why bambi have to tell the whole table what she and erica spoke about all this shit is fake as fuck they should just pull the plug on this show
All I’m saying is. If my friend does something to you. Don’t send for me. You don’t know how, I will hold my friend accountable or if we will be friends moving forward.and it’s none of your business. You have a problem with her, coming for me will only guarantee you will make an enemy of me. I have never been cliquey. And no this is not in defense of none of them it’s about being logical. Save ya energy, protect your peace.
Erica was dead wrong, but SPICE WAS WRONG FIRST. She took it there first when she said her son doesn’t even like her, then after Erica flipped the table she proceeded to scream that her son hates her. Why is nobody checking HER?! Smfh.
I love Spice 😂😂😂😂
Spice is getting on my nerves, she’s always agressive and makes everything about her Even if Erica talk to them it’s still a private conversation they don’t have to report everything she said
2:14 not Sierra forgetting her words 😂
Spice really needs a chill pill
This whole show can go.
SPICE IS RIGHT. She tired of the bullshit these cameras don’t mean shit to her. Love it. Erica was wrong bottoms ducking line
And thats why Erica looking how she looking right now... A MESS. Safaree her karma fr fr !
Spice come for people all the time
Spice needs therapy she is too angry. You got a second chance on life girl be humble
I LOVE SPICE!!!!!
Bambi is sounding a lot like Yandy now... y'all remember Rah Ali argument with yandy at the reunion?🤔🤭
Ain’t no way sierra tried to blame this on safaree-  We found the people who enable Erica to do this racist bs guys.
Spice is trying to fight Bambi who wasn't there and did not call you a monkey. Stay calm and keep that energy for the right person.
Lmaoooo not them getting into it and Erica isn't there 🤣🤣🤣
If Erica called them and told them everything except the part about her calling spice a blue monkey says alot in my eyes honestly
Tbh all 3 of them have been fake as hell on this show😂
That Islander shade is something else😅 " why you not talk to ya best friend Bambi?" Girl cause you know she lying like shit.
How many B words was that out of spice mouth.. o okay
Spice wanna start shit and then act like where did it go wrong those side azz comments wouldn’t work for me either
All diss ARGUMENTATION PEOPLE sad to see  FOR REAL😔
now for spice to be like i dont like the bitch word she love using it
I love how Bambi asked Spice " Who are you talking to" and " Why you so mad"......Spice act like she is Queen of the Show and everybody seem to be walking on eggshells around her.  Spice need to have a seat.
Anyone agreeing with erica is apart of the problem. N spice didnt talk about her child she talked about her parenting. If someone told me my son didnt like me i would probably laugh because im a secure mom n i kno wtf i do. Must be true Erica 🤷🏽‍♀️ either way the first reaction is a RACIAL SLUR … no different than a yt person calling me a n*GGEr Becus rhey are “upset” them. This is  wrong but not surprising most NON BLACK women want the BLACK D want to BE A BLACK WOMEN but EVVY & HATE BLACK WOMEN. We ARE the standard idc
😂😂😂
Not everyone still eating while Bambi and spice are arguing lmao they’re so use to all this fake shit at this point
Spice wound ain’t even healed and she wanna fight🙄 🫢
Spice doesn't like being called a bitch, but she called Bambi one at least 5 times during this conversation.  Bambi didn't once call Spice out of her name. Spice was so mad. Like Bambi can control what another grown woman says.😅
Not remni still eat her food with no hesitation 😂😂😂😂
Lmao Bambi be so cool on a hoe 🤣 anybody that calm gotta be a killer 🤣🤣🤣 I'm sorry.
I’m w spice ! I hate a 2face bytchhh
Spice will do anything for attention 😂
I want spice to leave the show. She’s SO much better than this lbs queen of dancehall deserves better! 💙
Spies I hate all this drama and not this fake stuff then why the hell are you in this reality show then if you hate all this fake and drama stuff Halia and love and hip-hop from East Coast to West Coast to area fucking film yeah it’s not about that life yeah I’m about to sit here and fight and get thrown off a show And I’m going to guess spies don’t have to friends because true friends have each other back  no matter if your friend is in the wrong and you in the right
It cracks me up how these black women are sticking their neck out for a woman who clearly hates black women deep down Is sierra even friends with her now?  Bambi sharing jail cells I’m sure  It’s all worth it
Ya in a situation like this when y’all arguing y’all say whatever y’all want but on tv you gotta look a different way.
I’m loving renni this season haha, she look so pretty and she fuckin that food UPP while watching the drama unfold 😌
Sierra need to sit down trying to blame Safaree
All you dummies stay answering Yandee thays why yall always in some drama
First off, the situation shouldn’t have been brought up there.
Spice started it.
Bambi needs to stop with the plastic work! She’s look MJish
But when Evelyn on Basketball Wives called Cece lingling they stilm chose to keep her SMH 🙄🤔
Spice was wrong. Idc idc idc stop talking about people’s children I would’ve called her a monkey and told her to touch some grass to clear up that yellow in them eyes. Talk about my kids imma try to hurt you in the soul idc. Then she looks for issues with everyone. Saw that sick storyline was ass and needed something quick.
Bambi and sierra are fake.  You should say yes i heard i dont agree with it but lets talk about it a different time. I dont think its right for the table tonight.  Shouting about as a black woman .... they both should understand just how hurtful that racial slur was. And at least empathise a little with her.  Talking about whats your issue!   Safari had nothing to do with what erica said you cant blame him.
Messy
Why are they always demeaning Spice... Bambi didn't have to talk to her like that.
I didnt know she was a puppet
Hey y'all Circuit court Judge Yandee Smith WANTS TO KNOW WHAT somebody said.When don't she?? Somebody gonna punch yandee so good one day.
00:30 the 1 that be playn games with chaotic looks like Doberman!
Bambi dammm well know she ain’t bout that fight life she acting as if she’s gonna throw hands 😅🤣🤣🤣
She’s fake always wanna drag people like diamond lil scrappy wife that way she don’t know about Bambi
It be funny how they expect someone to be t retaliate if they being talked too crazy,
Yancy should  kept her mouth  shut🤐😏
Get her spice.
I Used To Be Such A Big Fan Of Spice Before The Show. The More Clips I See Of Her On Here, The More Respect I Lose For Her. This The Same Woman Who Physically Attacked An Unsuspecting Tokyo Vanity Multiple Times Over Calling Her A Bitch, Yet Here She Is Calling Other Women Bitches So Freely.
What Erica said was dead wrong but Spice playing victim is sending me. Ma’am, you are not innocent….and why on God’s green earth would she be expecting them to discuss what they talked about with their friend to her!?
It blows my mind how so black people are justifying Erica’s comments. I think of lot of y’all only think that it’s just white people alone can be racist. What Erica said was disgusting and it showed her true self. There are a lot of Latin and Hispanic women that share Erica’s views on black women. The mere fact that black women are defending this, when Erica probably wouldn’t do the same for y’all is mind blowing 🤯.
Spice contract was probably gonna expire so now she wanna argue with everyone . Erica was bogish for say that out her mouth the same way spice shouldn't have brought up her older son. 2 wrongs don't make it right!
1:17 & 2:13 😂❤
Take Spice and throw her messy butt in the trash
How spice gone get up an say she wasn’t talking to Bambi an clearly she was 😂😂😂
First off this is Rasheeda's birthday dinner. Yandy didn't need to bring shit up. Yandy is an instigator and needs to learn to STFU. Spice could have left it alone. She knows Erica is close to Bambi and Sierra so why feel like they owe her an explanation. Everyone is going to have a different opinion on this argument. Everyone there wants to keep talking about it. This is between Spice and Erica leave it between them. Spice causes drama when it's convenient for her, yet when its her event she doesn't want drama.
She do look like 1 though and a hint of Smurf 🤣
I love spice
Sierra is right. This is all about Safaree.
Honestly spice gets off the hook from so many messy moments, like someone HAS to respect her she could've sat their and ate her damn food. If I don't wanna talk about my friend who isn't their stfu
Spice should have specified herself.
Spice too fake yes
Kirk was sitting there like: "I'm so glad the heat is off of me now". 😂😂😂 Mendeecees was scratching his head like he was lost ASF.😂😂😂 Was that Amy eating her food unbothered asf?😂😂😂
This is so ghetto,  this is NOT HOW WOMAN BEHAVE!
Spice is out of control and everyone around her acts like peasants
To all the black women defending her: she feels the same way about you as well. Keep that energy when it is directed at you. All I see is Black women defending this despicable woman Erica. She has a long history of calling black people m**kys. She posted a tweet back in 2015 comparing Johnny Blaze to a chimp. She has been doing this for YEARS!
I love spice because she is realer than any cast member in the LHH empire
Renni sitting there eating and watching the show is me af 😂
She might as well date safari and make a show about herself. She is not happy unless everyone unhappy if they don't have all eyes on her and on her alone. Sierra is right.
Spice is getting annoying
Really bambi😒you know exactly why spice was upset in that scene .
Spice needs to get off the show and cool off She’s so stressed
Spice u doing too much
I’m not condoning what Erica said, but I can’t stand women who choose to cape for men like Safaree, especially as a single baby mama who’s baby daddy left her in the dust.  Spice inserted herself into that situation and now these are the consequences
Brown people need to stop associating and accepting everything negative in representation of our Race. A monkey is a damn monkey! How is an animal a racial term towards Brown people, besides, a monkey skin is pink underneath his brown fur. They are more-so compared to caucasians.
If you gonna be a monkey, be a gorilla.
Erica was dead wrong for calling her a monkey,Yes she was ...Spice is always talking and getting smart with them and calling them bitches whenever she feels like it
Notice how Bambi is real slow get up when she gets into arguments. She waiting for security to help her out but when she was in scrappy face her energy is very different because she knows a man won’t hit her. Spice and Erica would lay her out 😂 sierra getting up saying it was safaree fault 😅😅i wonder what she would say now since they’re not friends. Karli is grubbing over there ply happy she isn’t in the drama 😊
Spice doesn’t have to go off on Bambi and Sierra I get it she’s mad but you don’t have to take it out on them just cause there friends with Erica…..
Oh boy Spice doing too much this season!! All she wants attention people 😂
Since nobody want to say it let me, SPICE is a bully.
Spice be doing too much sometimes
Everybody is forgetting about who cause all this back & forth between Spice & these girls. Mess is shakanna! She's a big part of the equations! She started all this trouble & then hid her hands! Nobody should really fight about Safari, but  Erica! There's a troublemaker amongst  them all & no one is looking at the real  problem, but only the one word monkey, not Ni-ga but monkey! Erica is getting physical for words that could have hurt Spice physically! But they want to give Erica a pass for her  physical actions!
People are really cattle. Erica’s kid is special needs and she and everyone attacking her knows that. It’s the low key high key disrespect and WHYYYYYY the fuq is it Bambi job to tell y’all what she speaks to her friend about. She should’ve road and said none if y’all business and if they kept talking about her “friend” she should’ve walked away from the militia of #cattle
Spice wearing that wig is not helping the whole situation.
Spice: you talking to me now b****? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Spice only does that cuz security right there
Spice is always aggressive period. Her anger is at the wrong people
The heads in middle😊😊😅 just moving left and right is comedy on its own...Bambi RIDE gal you don't want too rhomp wit Jamaican queen 👑🎭🐎🙌💋😘😍😭
Spice🩵💙
Erica has always been a clown and still is
I’m a professional fighter  The funniest thing is that this entire cast argue with the mouth but nobody has technique when it comes to fighting  Like most humans don’t have a clue of how to fight.
Bambi, the lie detector test says you’re lying.
Spice is weird. Bambi is NOT responsible for Erica's behaviour!! Hold erica accountable for her behaviour! Erica was dead ass wrong, Bambi did NOTHING to Spice.
You talk about my kids I will call you all the damm bad names I know
Spice: *calmly* y'all so fake Bambi: Who the bleep you bleeeeeping talkin to Comments: Spice so angry and mad at everyone Me: *replays the video* cuz clearly I missed something
Spice needs to heal as well. From the near 💀 experience and now this? She is on defense.  She's been lashing out lately and its because she is scared of her own personal out come.  I feel bad for her . Prayers up.
Spice is so extra and plays the victim
Erica doesn’t have any problem with no black people, her ex husband black her kids his half back and her friends is black. Spice already wanted to start something and CAN'T finish it when two people are fighting you will say something hurtful to them. Bye people
Its the head turn from Yandy and Mandecee at the same time😂 for me
Spice It’s just words 😂😂
Now Erica & Sierra ain’t even friends 😅
I love spice idc
LMFAO it went from “we haven’t talked to her about that” straight to “well the stuff she said was wrong but really it’s all on Safari” LMFAO please gtfomf. Spice was absolutely right to call them out on their blatant bullshit
Y’all be mad I dont care but Spice is playing the victim role. Your issue is not with Bambi or sierra it’s with Erica. Then you wanna get buck with someone because you didn’t get the answer you wanted. And now you wanna resort to calling somebody a giraffe just like you called Tokyo Toni a cow and start fights. Spice acts like a wild ass animal and y’all love to make excuses for her. If anything, Erica should have been actually fired (not just suspended) and spice should have been reprimanded too. Spice ain’t no angel.
"U  got the key to the region...tell ha" shakina is what lhh been needing for the comedic relief is gold.
So spice wants to beef with all Erica friends now?! When they see what she said they'll either decided to stay friends or not or will check her about it.. spice really had no reason to do all this over her & Erica beef
Bam knew what time it was and she didn't feel it wasn't right that Erica called her a Monkey. A sneaky snake is always snake. Recording Scrappy I wouldn't trust her for 💩. She wonder why her marriage blew up.
I've really grown to like Spice... She's a woman of integrity and authenticity. She don't straddle the fence! How are you with a Black man and using slurs like that? I am glad she was fired. She is definitely a non-factor to me!
Spice turns trash. Especially her getting nominated now we see why she didn't win she hanging with people got her looking bad
I’m team spice she maybe not be all clean but she never called nobody a racial slur she have all the right to call them on they lies
Spice is always standing up, trying to get violent with someone. She’s clearly the problem.
Spice doing to much now ridiculous 😊
if yall don’t see spice as the problem im lost plz explain ya logic😭
Yes Erica was wrong but I know for one I am tired of seeing black women continue to tear each other-calling a women the b word is disrespectful as well..Can we all just do better 😢 it is heart breaking at this point
SUKIHANA WAS THE FIRST TO USE THE WORD "MONKEY" DEROGATORY! "SWAMP MONKEY" TO BE EXACT!
Omg 😮
I’m renni sitting there eating my food before it gets cold but observing the mess at the same time 😂😂😂
Spice mad she got called a monkey but yelling giraffe to bambi....can someone give me the list of do's and dont's when it comes to what animal black women are appropriate to be? 😂 and bambi is a deer so they be looking dumb af to me
Spice is annoying. She is an instigator and aggressive and then later tries to play victim way back to her issuses with Tokoyo
Spice got a mouth when someone call her out
Spice doing too much
Am i the only one who finds it funny wen spice says b... Tch
Spice is detoxing the cast and I am HERE FOR IT get rid of the self proclaimed mean girls!
Lmao spice right cuz girls gone call u
I feel like Spice is giving monkeyish behavior now🤷🏾‍♀️
I definitely don't condone what Erica said but Spice need to take some responsibility for what happened.  I saw that scene and Spice in no way was receptive to Erica in that moment.  She said something about her motherhood and so, when Spice went low, Erica sunk even lower. At no time does two wrongs equal a right. Why is it as black people the only thing we see is the slur? What about the slander of it all. That was between Erica and Spice and not Erica and the whole black race.
Spice is annoying!!! Periodt! On that scene, nobody ask nothing to her and she came like someone was ofended her. She get into the conversation that no one ask her nothing!!
SPICE IS A PROBLEM SHE THINKS SHE HOLDS WEIGHT AND SHES STARTING WITH EVERYONE MEAN WHILE YOUR MESSING WITH MAD PEOPLE FROM LHH ON THE LOW ! Please  spice starts a lot of low key trouble be real with yourself
Spice needs to go ! Shekinah too.
Outside of the racial tensions and what not, spice can’t keep jumping and being aggressive with everybody. Eventually she’s gonna meet her match with someone who’s willing to go there with her.
Spice been doing to much, I'm starting to see she is the problem, nasty attitude.
You talking to Sierra but said “y’all” and started off by first addressing Bambi. I cannot do spice. She always been a D rider. I’m sorry.
One thing I am not gonna do is sit at a table and tell anyone my conversation with my best friend , Idgaf what it’s about , I ain’t piling on my friend , spice is a fkn idiot
This is getting old.
Spice is the victim.  Not anyone else at that table!  You can't role with me and use any type of defamatory language about my people, my culture and expect to be cool because it wasn't directed to me! Mena the mole rat been using racial slurs and it's time she got checked and anyone defending her actions deserve the same heat.  Foh Bambi!
What the f is wrong with spice can’t she never stay quiet and lessen to what the ppl have to say she thinks that she will always be right. She thinks she better then everyone
I need more compilations
I mean Bambi is fake as hell but I don’t know if this was the time or place for this conversation
Spice should’ve never came on this show.  I totally understand how she may feel frustrated and cornered due to what she just went through, but I hate seeing her get so worked up.  This show isn’t good for her health.  She deserves better than this.
How is taciest when erica call her a animal name but yhey call babmbi all types of animals now if black women call her a monkey would it be raciest like everybody know erica is not raciest. Spice started all this! Why you tallong to her baby dad behind jer back in there buisness and then start acting weird towards her??
This might be controversial but I don’t have any sympathy for Spice. What Erica did was wrong. Point blank. Spice instigated that reaction though and now her feelings are hurt. But babes, when you deal with people who are anti-black, and then antagonize them… what did you expect? Similarly, she is angry at these girls for being fake. But that’s who they’ve always been and have only ever shown that to be their true colors but she acts as though this is suddenly new. Spice knows these people and gets to acting up and then acts appalled when they’re not acting in a way that benefits her. But she’ll let them act however to everyone else. 🥱
Now hold on did she just called Bambi a giraffe???? But you saying Erica racist for saying monkey tho
Y’all killing me 😒 she called called Spice a blue monkey lol it was funny if you don’t want ppl calling you names don’t talk about they kids  don’t bring up someone else’s kids in an argument all season Spice been acting Spicy lol like ppl supposed to kiss your A** girl bye 👋🏾 you was rude as hell to Erica and it’s like everyone is siding with you because of Erica’s past I dont care she should’ve said more I would’ve Im with Erica on this you couldn’t have watched that episode and thought she was at Fault y’all watching clips 🤷🏾‍♀️
I love Spice!! Bambi is 100% fake for sure.
I can’t do spice and couldn’t ever have. She’s a good artist but couldn’t ever do her on LHH… you use the term “yall” and wondered why Bambi responded. If you was talking to Sierra, why not say Sierra…?
So we gonna just act like spice ain't say nothing about someone's child🤷🏿‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️😩😵😵‍💫 yandy was asking the questions spice just came out the blue and said you haven't talk to your friend? First question. Next question was why YALL so fake.. I can't wait for spice to exit.
I'm TIRED of Spice. I'm surprised no one popped her in the mouth yet.I understand that your upset about what Erica said but your mouth is reckless  and it shows again during this clip when Bambi was explaining her conversation with Erica, you kept chiming in saying little comments.
Karlie in the background:  🍲 🥄 🍴😋🤣🤣
Wow 😂😂
Just because she's friends with Erica doesn't mean she had a part in what Erica said, that's spice and Erica beef not Bam, I wish a mother fucker would come for me for what my bestie said.
Reality show consists of arguments, banter and bs. NO ONE SHOUKD BE EXCUSED for racial epithets!
It’s yandy and mendeecess face turn in sync for me lol
I ain’t gotta repeat a conversation btwn my best friend and I and I won’t repeat a conversation btwn my best friend and I , if I disagreed with what she said I would address her , it’s no one’s business what I tell my best friend , I don’t need to check my best friend in front of anyone .
"You haven't talk to your best friend👀😒" bwoii mi love Spice😂
Definitely on Spice side with this! Call out the fake BS!!!
Spice isn't wrong. I have beef with racists and anyone that associates with them. period.
As a black woman  you talk about my kids and cross that line yeah I’m gonna be racist towards to you like y’all think someone gonna question me and bout my child disrespect me and my child and then I’m suposoe to care about calling her a monkey no oh well spice should’ve never talked about her kids
Pause. As a black woman I do not condone what Erica said and did it was wrong. However, are we going gloss over Spice saying some fuck up shit about Erica’s relationship with her son. Because anyone who is a mother is going to want blood I don’t care who it is. And the fact spice want to call somebody fake after every she did to Tokyo. That is laughable 😂😂. Look in the mirror first before call someone else fake.
I love karlie lmaooo she just eating while they fighting
Girl, why should Erica come to y’all about what she said? As black women, y’all should feel offended and disrespected enough to call her out on it. If she feel that way towards spice, what y’all think she gonna feel towards y’all when y’all fall out? Cuz we all know that’s bound to happen dealing wit her.   She been working a lot? Girl bye, she got enough to time to sit and boohoo 24/7 about safaree and fight Bambi’s battles with scrapp, but suddenly she don’t have enough time to discuss her being racist? And then y’all wanna be mad at spice for being upset that y’all ain’t call her out on it. Gtfoh, all 3 of them need to be fired. BYE!
Yea Bambi lying ass got real defensive!
Safaree isn't in any if this,Erica and Erica alone is the cause of this BS!
I’m ready to see Shekinah have a story of her own. Where is her family????!!!!!
When Jamaicans start cuss 😂 dunno why spice is doing this silly American accent finish dem bumbo c l a r r t 🗑
Why is Yandy and Menfaeces on here?! Why can't they bow out Gracefully?! Word to dutty eediat gal Spice!   Tbh, Spice is ruining the franchize atp!   Spice is so damn problematic! Ugh! Cant stand her!   I loathe Erica Mena, but Spice is no better in my book!
This Season Spice has started with Karlie, Then Meda, Then Erica, Now Bambi , almost Shakinah. And Sierra.   Y’all still on Spice’s side?   Y’all still don’t see who has the real problem??   Smh.  She ain’t tried this with the right one yet.  Done sat up here and called Bambi 18 bishes , but she’s the same one who said she doesn’t like being called a bish when Akbar was calling her a bish.  This lady gots to go !!!!
I don't care what anyone says this issue with Spice and Erica SPICE HAD A NASTY ENERGY WHEN ERICA WALK INTO THE RESTAURANT. Now if you know I have an issue with my son and that's a trigger for me I won't use that as a silver bullet. Erica went low because Spice went low so Spice is not innocent. When your arguing you use your words to cut somebody and that's what Erica did. Spice started all this mess! Then she's antagonizing Bambi for a reaction (just like she did with Toyko years ago about her weight). So I don't understand why this is the SPICE VICTIM TOUR??? Spice also is going to have her day where somebody is gonna beat her ass!
Every single one of those women kept shovelling that food into their mouths....between all the "who you talking to and b!tch"...we need to do better in our community. That's shameful.
It’s Yandy and her husband with the plenty vowels simultaneously turning their heads 😂
I’m sick of spice tbh she feeling that Grammy too much HUMBLE YOURSELF…. You can’t talk to people any kind of way and expect them to take it with a smile …..
So spice ain’t the problem… okay
Spice is REALLYYYY annoying with yelling  and it was not right for erica to say that but leave bambi out of it
I know on the internet everyone wants to judge people and act like saints but I won’t. Im with spice on this one.. you talk to your friends everyday about everything and now all of sudden you haven’t heard for me.. cut that fake shit.
Spice is rude as hell
SPICE IS NOW THE ANGRY JAMAICAN WOMAN. BISH BY
Did she just try to blame safaree lmao
Spice was brought back to life to be. A fucking mean girl she lost me
Spice is wrong stayed lane that shit along it over with time . Moving own that girl right it's safree that stared this mess
ask her spice no fake bitches out here
The comments talking about “Spice started it” no one is talking about that anymore. We are talking about bigotry. If your brain is too slow to comprehend that Erica Mena hurled racial slurs,  then just sit this one out. It is NEVER okay to be racist, whether provoked or not because now she has exposed how she really feels about Spice to the whole world, and we can’t condone that behavior. Just like we wouldn’t condone it from a white person. Y’all need to work on your consistency with protecting the black community.
They lying again good call Spice cut the crap 💩
Spice doin too much, i dont even know where her real issues start cause she really threw herself into Erika and Safaree mess and is now a victim😅. And its clear off the last scene spice had w Sierra that they all spoke to Erika but Erika left that crucial racist part out. And that since they found out what she said fr they havent had the time to call and correct just yet..filming drama reasons im sure. Nonetheless spice been mixing in some shit and shes messier than shekinah..its been pissin me off.. Grace Hamilton, let us get back to the music amd calm tf down
I ❤ SPICE!!!
Spice snappin on everybody ain’t gone help the situation…
Why did Bambi get so buck? Weird.
spice isn't wrong for how she feels...But neither is Erica..I know if Anyone Talk about or Mention my Kid I'm Diffently going to say something Far Way Worse than Blue Monkey...And spice blue wig does look a mess on this episode...She has money she can do wayyyy better than that chopped up blue wig
It’s Renni eating for me, 😂😂
We get upset when another race call us out of our names like that. But we females, especially when it's a dark skin. Black woman do it to each other all the time. The same energy that we have when another race says some s. S*** like that, we need to have it for ourselves, too.
This whole conversation could have been avoided if Yandy have never asked Bambi about Erica. Yandy started the conversation it was not a time for that she could have asked Bambi that privately.I’m not a Bambi fan but she answered to a question so the energy should have went towards Yandy knowing spice is there.
Spice is right those other girls are a sorry excuse for a black woman
SPICE THE REASON I STOPPED WATCHING
Spice cant get along with anyone lol
bambi now you knoww spice didn’t get up to talk cmon nowww
So what mona gonna do about Bambi being called horsey and giraffe it's no different they calling ppl animals and out there name
I agree with Spice 💯
Bambi had no empathy for spice what so ever....You know need a deep talk to verify if the the slur was said or not. Bambi is a known liar so this is an obvious lie. She feels no connection to her blackness and would rather play dumb and evade the issue like most self-haters do.
Spice is too overly aggressive for me.
Spice throw shots then want to hide her hand. If you talk about someone kid dont be suprised if they react.  Same way she called bambi a giraffe but erica saying monkey is were yal draw the line.  Spice pushing 50 acting like a blue 🐒
If spice brought up my child in an argument I'm calling her a blue haired gorilla. 🤷🏿‍♀️ Look at how she is looking for problems right now.
Yandy eyebrows come on girl like your a millionaire get your eyebrows done by someone else
Why are black people mad about the monkey comment every ethnicity out there calls you guys monkeys 😂
the day these reality shows are canceled will be a great day
Now I do love me some bam and, Mena and Sierra...but ladies....yall know DAMN WELL they talked to their friend AS SOON AS they seen that ish! I do love me some spice too...however, she always so quick to "little girl" someone and call them out their name "biiiiitch" like spice...yall are 40 and some of yall 40+ ...where are your communication skills? Spice been that way since she came on this show. Like we get it, you were and still are bullied, judged and held back musically because of your skin color. But we didn't do that to you. There's no reason to constantly be on the defensive towards everybody around you. I can assure you, they and we are not out to get you...we love you! You just need to work on your temper and communication skills!
Spice plays victim. And she acts like no one can’t say shit to her but try to fight everyone .
if it was racial the N word with a big ER would’ve played a part y’all really barking up a wrong tree cause dominican n rica are black !!!! they have african roots so this. racial card is bs y’all need a history. check an if i remm correctly black ppl in school would call hati n african monkey  🙈 so y’all can call ya own ppl monkey but a light skin ? cant make it make sense
I haven't forgot how Sprice treated Tokyo. Erica was dead wrong but Spice is a disrespectful, nasty attitude having person herself.
It’s mendecees and yandi looking back and forth for me 🤣
Seems to me like spice always willing and ready to start something.
I cannot stand bambi😭🤣🤣🤣
I don’t Condone violence as a black women i’m glad someone saw through Bambi BS
YO SPICE “ YOU TALKING TO ME NAH BISH “ 💀😂‼️
You can’t take the bullshit but you with the bullshit you could’ve kept the queue kept a classy but no, you wanted to show your aggressiveness and your hostile ass
I can’t stand bambi
Spice this show is beneath you . Because she is the only one on the show that has talent.
Talk your shit spice
Spice is disrespectful af 🙄
Other than being racistttttt she wished death on her and flipped a table on her injury
Honestly Spice been aggy since she came so hard at Shay during the family reunion
I'm not black.... But I would react as spice did. I hate fake s***. Bambi could've said: "I heard about that, it saddens me and I don't want to talk about it." She didn't need to act like she knows nothing. Spice was not right for mentioning Ericas son. But calling a black woman a monkey is next level, because people forget that human zoos existed? That black people were dehumanised and were compared to apes during colonisation and slavery? If you call me a Westasian woman a monkey it would be still insulting but not as bad as calling a black woman that. Pick up a history book. I would be LIVID if I was insulted like that, having a table shaken on me and people acting like nothing happened. Spice is not always right (for example Tokyo and Shae) but damn I understand her.
Spice is beautiful and very honest…  Bambi being a real friend is telling your friend she’s wrong
If u talk about people kids u are going to be call what ever come out my mouth
SPICE LOVE HER BUT SHE PUT THIS ON THE WRONG PEOPLE YOU MAD AT ERICA BE MAD AT HER NOT HER FRIENDS WTF
All Bambi said was she didn’t get to go into detail w Erica about what happen but they did speak about it briefly. She didn’t get the full story til sierra recently told her. What tf was the problem for her to call her a giraffe and a bitvh for no reason. Then she proceeds to want to fight. Like girl how tf you gone tell me what I know. Lmaoooo. Best friend or not she blatantly and respectfully gave her answer to the question that was asked. Spice jus didn’t like her answer and felt like she must know something. Like girl. I sincerely hope she wasn’t expecting two best friends to tell what they other best friend been saying. Like be all the way fucking fr. It ain’t yo business so they kept it cute as they should. Spice is far from innocent with the antagonist antics and the way she speaks to people when she down agree.
So did they fight?🤔
And spice not wrong idc cause they are being fake just like tht faked the whole scene tb Bambi didn’t know whole time Bambi was the first person she told 🙄 spice over the fake weird follow the leader bs with them 3 bitches and I would be too
Bambi been fake lol. Good for her getting called out. Please get her off the show.
Spice needs to get off this show. She has talent. Do like Cardi, leave now. She's selling her soul for ratings. I don't like the hypocrisy with her now. She's turning into a mean girl.
I wonder if they seen the last episode… because yah she said it multiple times and then proceeded to make the noises while she entered the car! So if they wanna enable it they are apart of the problem! If I found out somebody I know called someone a racial slur nahhhh it’s gonna go down because you crossed the line
Spice and Erica need to get popped. Erica should’ve never call her a monkey but spice survived only to become nasty n bitter thinking she get a pass. I don’t think so
Women holding women accountable let’s see if it’s a success
Ive never thought to call someone a racial slur while arguing and im white. Erica is disgusting
I’m starting not to like spice, she doing to much
WHY can Spice call Bambi Bitches and Giraffes but she mad Erica called her a monkey!!! The hypricosy.....
Spice toooooo much
Ok don’t get me wrong, Erica is completely wrong for what she said during the argument, but we not gon act like spice is right
Spice is such a nasty person. This victim shit been getting overlooked especially now that Erica done said something nasty in response… but this is out of pocket. Why is Spice mad that Erica’s friends didn’t want to speak about a negative topic involving their friend??? Bambi did right! Called them fake she showed that ain’t nobody to be fake for.
Everyone defending Spice and acting like she isn't the ISSUE when she has argued with almost every woman on this show 🤣
When Yal gone see thru Spice…. Yal ever heard “people will always remember your reaction but never ask about wat was done to get that reaction”….wat Erica said was wrong but spice lit the fuse to begin with
I’m not negating the fact that spice should not have been called a monkey but as a viewer I see that spice is always the aggressor and she gets shit started. She’s very spiteful and angry most of the time. Bambi didn’t deserve to be talked to like that.
I’m sorry Spice needs to get popped. Alotta Jamaicans look down on African Americans whether they admit it or not and think we punks. She misdirecting energy. I love people from all over but had to handle a few carribeans thinking they was gonna whip something n give them a good pop to let them know they not running no show cuz they voice get big n they say bumba clot. Gtfoh
I want to know how spice is going to give off all this shade, and all this aggressiveness and act like she’s a victim
Why spice always "Blue"...??? I need her blond hair.  ❤️ Love From Thailand
Spice has everything fake she just projecting what she is they need to fire her she calls everybody dog but she don't like when people call her out
Girl like spice said im talking to you biitch like she said why yall so fake tf whole table we know bambi and seirra big lying and now whats funny none of them even friends d
Erica Called Spice ," BLUE Monkey" not Black Monkey. SPICE lying n playing Victim when she started it LOL😂😂
The other cast members know to STFU because they don’t want to get cut either! 😂
People keep saying Spice is wrong but how when this girl called her a monkey and these two acting like they're deers in headlights. I wouldve been annoyed too
Teenie boopers 😮😅
They better stop playing in Spice face na 😭 Sn: 444th like
On reflection, I think Erica might have been right.
Spice you calling the girl fake . Then she replied who the fuck you talking too . Spice are you normal ?
What spice said was something she shouldn’t brought up but Erica crossed the line. Spice needs to get out of that show that’s not good for her reputation. Is she wants people to take her career serious she needs to go.
Spice is too much she’s too old to be acting so petty I think she’s secretly in love with safaree
Spice was wrong & I don’t think Erica was wrong the way she reacted that lady have 2 children with a black half ass man Spice need a story line that’s what it seems like
Spice ain’t HAVING IT!!!!! And I’m with her!
I am lost wtf are they arguing about?
Spice is getting just as crazy as Erica Mena now. She is as triggering as Erica is. She wants to pick fights with everyone now. If she wants to ride or die for Safaree cause she believes him regardless it’s same with other people they get to choose who they want to ride or die for. When you trigger someone then be ready for just about any confrontation and don’t act victim. Erica might be toxic & wrong for using bad choice of words but Spice was equally triggering by taking sides using someone’s child to hurt feelings and getting involved between 2 bitter exes. Both Erica & Spice need to be cancelled.
I’m Shekinah nothing is gonna ruin my meal!!!! 😂😂😂😂
Erica calling spice a 🔵 monkey 🐵Anit got nothing to do with black women period!! that just how Erica felt about spice
Tbh, spice is right when she say Bambi lying about not talking to Erica about it. Sierra did a whole video of the scene with her and Bambi and Erica about Safaree calling her and telling her he wanted to be with her. And in that scene Bambi was like "whatttt 😮omg that's why yall took me out the group chat....", saying she didn't know about it. Meanwhile sierra made the video on YT saying Bambi was the 2nd person she called right after Safaree told her that.  Bambi lies so effortlessly😂😂😂😂
Spice did entirely way too much. Bambi isn’t her enemy, Erica is. Spice must be dealing with lots of underlying anger because Bambi didn’t even start the argument first.
Safari ain’t do nun
Erica was wrong af.. this is why I don’t allow the N-word from anyone other than a negro.. they get to saying that shit then they get mad at you and call you one for real.. no thanks. Nip the micro aggressions in the bud ASAP.. idgaf if they Rican or something mixed with African.. they don’t respect or understand like we do.. now look at these beautiful women.. lack of boundaries caused a massive impact on both ladies and their friends/cast mates.
Now imagine this scene but with Mimi at the table eating her food unbothered 😂😂
uhhhhhhg Spice again, she cries for everything like shut up akready
This is why Erica ain’t wrong for calling her no monkey giraffe really? 🦒
Spice is so fucking annoying. Like ughhh. Girl you caused all the issues.
Spice would stomp these hoes down lol
spice is doing way too much! someone tell her to relax!
Spice is bad news and has been since season 7. Spice is a sociopath!!! Never trust a chick like that.
Call them chicks out Spice!! They been running round ganging up on ppl since the season started!!
2:01 Sierra was actually right about this. The whole ongoing “beef” right now only boils down to one person and that’s Safari.
Seems like the girls are getting their karma. I bet Tokyo Vanity is somewhere laughing. Feeling real vindicated
I always thought Bam was a little on the fake side.
I always thought Bam was a little on the fake side.
Saferee did start this because he clearly feeding spice information and that’s how that argument happened
Spice is the new Joseline. A bully, the only difference is at least Joseline is funny.
Spice always the victim !! Now she clearly started this BS now she thinks she’s the victim…SMH
Spice was talking to both of them ! Then lied saying she was talking to Ciara 😂
Spice did way to much dead ass
First off this wasn’t the place to have this conversation. It was a birthday dinner party. Second spice just had surgery and should be healing but instead out here yelling, jumping up from tables, and seems very angry at this point. Why all that aggression? You need to chill and heal sis and stay in the background.
anyone defending erica’s words, whether your a cast member or a viewer, is a loser. especially if you’re black. nothing spice said justifies erica mena being racist. erica has ALSO spoken on other peoples kids on the same show. so i don’t even wanna hear it.
Wrong is wrong but spice girl your doing too much... u went below she went under.... stop acting like it’s the 1st time someone called u black we all very black and gone thru all that go cook spice in your new house...
Nun of this would’ve have never happened if spice brought the girl parenting up like damn idc!!!
Spice is very miserable and angry.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bambi ALWAYS wants to get rude! Sierra was more humble than Bambi; irrespective of not knowing the full of the situation...
I’m sorry but Spice riding out for Safaree too hard sumn ain’t right 😒🤔
Spice always does a lot once the camera turned to her
Spice has a right to be upset but with Erica not these ladies. And you can't make  them admit to speaking to Erica about you. Can we count the many times Spice called Bambi a female dog. You can't fight everyone one.
safaree dem gyal own u an apology
It’s about time somebody calls out Bambi. She always got on my nerves.
Spice is always so mad. She dont mind her own bussinesss
People like Erica like to profit off the black community while still being anti-black💯💯 she is not the only one
Why is spice always on 10 though….that’s the problem
For spice to have a second chance at life she sure is angry ... First it was Karlie , then Erica , now Bambi. Im not saying what erica did was right , but spice did start that fight . Im starting to believe spice is the problem
Spice is doing way too much like sis chill take a pill and clam down honey you too old to be yelling and popping off. How you made at the world when it’s only one person that did that to you?
Erica is on black shows, on black networks and have the nerve to call multiple black women monkeys and think she would keep her job🤣🤦🏽‍♀️ She don’t like black people but like profiting black culture and the black community💯💯
This show is disrespectful TOXIC AS F I'm Good On All of this BS Im watching Baddie East for less talk an more fighting 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂.
Spice is not wrong
Granted even if this is bambi wrong is wrong and once again spice ass was coming disrespectful first just like she did erica and not to mention she was nasty asf to karlie ealier that episode bambi and spice are not even close friends she not entitled to tell what they dicussed plus obviously she was talking to bambi and not just sierra beaucse she said yall while looking at bambi tf now its fked up what Erica said however she wouldn't have even took it that far if you didnt come sideways at her first nobody on this cast finna feel bad for you with that nasty stank ass attitude gtfo
Blaaa blaaa blaaa dumb ass show is that all grown ass the woman can do now a days arguing with each other kmft
I'm sick of spice it's time for her to go😂look at her quick to go off then get mad when somebody call her out they gone lose viewers messing with spice I can see it now😂
Someone needs to get spice help she never wins an award and I think it’s getting to her. She’s behaving so ridiculous but pretending she’s a good person it’s weird
At this point, Spice is trying to have a problem with Everyone about every lil thing..🙄🙄🙄.
Spice is a liar erica called her a blue monkey to be exact and i dont feel like that was racist because she always has on blue and some ppl say she ugly like a monkey!!!! Whats the different with her calling bam a giraffe based on her looks ppl call her a deer and a giraffe!!! Spice is running with the black word to turn everyone against her until it comes out at the reunion and they all gonna feel stupid...THEY WERE BOTH WRONG
spice said what everyone was thinking
Bambi looking scared once again when somebody jump up and pop off on her.. she better watch out cause she getting closer and closer to get her ass whooped
Spice just blew me! I love me some spice but she mad at wrong person.
Erica Mena has a HISTORY of calling MULTPLE black women monkeys, most who didn’t talk about her kids. She’s being fire now because those old tweets are resurfacing. That firing was well deserved🙌🏾🙌🏾 Byeeee
I love spice but she is a Bully 😂😂
And that's why Spice gets my energy, I cannot with Bam and Erica, it's infuriating.
Spice hate when people call her a bitch but precedes to call Bambi a bitch over and over again and Bam didn't call her out her name once. Say what you want about Erica or Bam, but Spice has her faults as well. She far from innocent. Just saying
Bambi the 🐴 is really fake . Why she’s on tv and what is she doing in her daily lives ? Does she have a job? She should find another “CABIN “
How is spice gonna tell her who she talk to wtf I’m so confused!
Erica racist.🎉 Bambi be lying and Sierra blame everyone but herself. Spice is sick of them😭🤣
YESSSS SPICE take down that whole group they so nosey rude fake. Bambi Erica Karlie and Sierra that little group is just so ughhhhh. Call them out. Cause if my “bestie” said a racial slur I would have to talk to them immediately cause when u said that u insult me too cause I’m black. Ooooh chileeee
Some of y’all acting real strange in these comments.   “Spice do too much”, but y’all are busy deflecting that a non-Black woman called a Black woman a slur, and she has a reason to be mad. If my non-Black “friend” called one of my Black folks a slur, that’s a dead mission, and no other justifications need to be had.  And it isn’t Erica’s first rodeo. So stop.
Spice is horrible this season. Erice was dead wrong for being racist but Spice needs to calm down with everyone else.
Girl she don’t have to tell you if she talked to Erica or not
If Spice feels like that maybe she should remove herself frm the situation instead of starting fights with people.  She went frm being the starter to the aggressor with fighting now just like they fired Erica they should come dwn hard on Spice.
It's sad how the whole love and hip hop season seems like it's all about everyone coming for Erica Bambi and Sierra and whatever it is is clearly working cause these comments. I'm a spice fan and I feel like they know erica enough to know that mentioning her son was her trigger and erica is wrong for using those words. Spice u dead wrong people just defending u because she used a so called racist slur what if she didn't use it. And now u wanna come for bambi it's just so sad
Bambi always being fake and phony she needs off the show all she is , is a sidekick. Now that scrappy is out her mix she wants to be in everybody business but her own….
Spice threw a lot of b words towards The Bam... I'm actually proud of her for not throwing it back at her (probably trying to sympathize with Spice/cover for her friend); but we'll see what happens next week. However, this is the reason why she's in the situation she's in (her mouth). By no means am I a fan of The TightFace Squad (excluding Sierra), but this is truly unfortunate. Spice is no victim and Erica BEEN throwing racial slurs. It's all unfortunate though.
Omg at this point just get spice out the show we can’t even understand what she says anyways
I don't blame bambi I would not wanna comment on anything either
If pop star spice a Real Artist  Then why tf is she still on this show 😒
They can never have a conversation without fighting. They are is acting like they are in high school 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
SPICE WAS WRONG!!! PERIOD.!!! YOU DO NOT BRING KIDS IN A SITUATION... AND MFS SITTING AROUND SPICE LIKE SPICE WAS IN THE RIGHT. NO BITCH YOU WRONG... KIDS ARE OFF LIMITS AT ALL TIMES.....!!!!! PERIOD...!!!!!
Honestly love and hip hop needs to come to an end it had its good run but now it's not as fun to watch
Spice always doing too much… please DO NOT BRING HER BACK!
👀
Spice is getting very annoying. To tell Bambi “I’m not talking to you” when  you were indeed talking to her, then to say “now I’m defensive” as if you have any right to be. Don’t act like a victim in an argument that YOU started. Spice just wanted to fight somebody. Grow up
Erica Mena is going say the comment to somebody and that will get your asss kick for real. Racism and racial comment is real no joke period.
If you are a black person and you get called a slur, and your mutual chose the person who called you a slur and looking like you are crazy. They aren't your friends. Spice is completely in the right
Spice is doin way too much. If u think the Bambi is fake, don’t mess wit her or others that mess wit her simple ass that🤦🏾‍♂️
Spice is doing a lot! I think they are full of shit too but daaaaamn! Too much energy for a heating woman. She was talking to Bambi first of all!! She said y’all!
I don't understand why everyone is saying Spice did too much. Those girls said they didn't even believe that Erica really said it. I know damn well one of them reached out to her and asked her about it after they heard that it happened. They're Black women as well and should speak up. Best friends or not, wrong is wrong!!!
Spice can’t be mad at Bambi for what Erica said it’s giving delulu
I’m on Spice side during this.
I thought spice hated the B word now she saying it all Willy nilly
"You wanna talk now?! Let's go n talk" when Spice tells yo ass not to talk to her cause she KNOWS you're fake af. You are going to start a problem if you really think you can talk to her after lying through your face infront of all them ppl .
i feel like y'all are forgetting that Erica HERSELF has said on national TV and on multiple occasions that her firstborn doesn't like her. The reason why she reacted the way she did towards Spice is because the guilt is eating her alive. She can't go back in time and fix it with her son. That's why she reacted the way she did.   Also, you guys say "if you talk about my son all bets are off" so RACISM and a death wish is acceptable? The reason why Erica has went scratch free for her racist comments all these years is because she was a token for Love and Hip Hop for YEARS. VH1 wouldn't let her go but MTV doesn't play these games.  Stop defending a who is now being held responsible for HER ACTIONS.   Tamar need to take her own advice and have SEVERAL seats! She said herself that she never watched the show and only saw a 30 second clip. then why comment on it? i know she was on the show where you have to comment on what is going on but she could of kept her response generic instead of playing "devil's advocate" for a woman has degraded people for years.  Jess Hilarious needs to focus on her Breakfast show hosting.  Her saying "maybe Spice looked like a monkey to her" is very anti-black. As a black woman , dark-skin at that why would you defend a person who has been DEGRADING your people for YEARS. But she was the same woman mad when people were saying she looked like a man? oh okay. Jess sit down somewhere.  yes they were both wrong but out of ALL the insults Erica could of spewed at her she CHOSE to call her a monkey, make monkey noises and wish DEATH on a woman who was nearly on her death bed a couple months ago and still has the scars and trauma from that horrible experience?  let's be real here. What spice did was wrong yes but how many people mentioned Erica's son and she didn't have the same smoke for them the way she did spice? that let's me know its deeper than that bc quite honestly she never actually spoke on the son directly.    She does all this over a man that she claims she doesn't like? but still lets him have sex with her?  She is mad at spice because Safaree is showing spice the attention Erica should of had in their marriage. She even admitted that she felt some type of way when Safaree cried after hearing spice was in the hospital. That is not spices fault. she doesn't control how safaree reacts to her or what he does. and that is why Erica was initially mad at spice which was the reason for the table talk in the first place. Spice even said on her live that she told Safaree to stop dogging Erica and treating her the way that she does.    I get she has 2 kids with this man but there's also something called separation co-parenting. Erica WANTS safaree to want her and choose her so they can be together and it is not happening and that is why she's spiraling on any and everybody.
Spice was wrong talking about Erica Mena son. Erica Mena was wrong making racial comment to Spice and throwing table at her. Two wrongs don't make a right.
Spice knows when a bih being lie and fake 😂👏🏼
😮🎉
Spice basically broke the 4th wall and said, "quit playing the role."  Edit: Replaced “quick” with “quit.”
Why spice always aggressive ☠️
The Bam A.K.A. Horsee, Sierra and Erica Mennonite, give a whole new meaning to "trauma bonding".
Let’s be real here, all the fights are beginning to blend together. At some point it has to deal with safaree, the next one of the 2 Erica’s, 🦌🦌🦌 and Scrappy problems, etc. I wish it was simple like Rasheeda and Kirk dusty milk did ass. He looks like one of those milk duds that you find under a couch for a while and has dust and hair all on it. Where is that LHH because this is too much for me.
I like spice to a degree but she did do a lot in this scene. She was upset prior and brought the energy to the table. Cause sierra and Bambi were being cool not upset.
Aside from this Erica mess, spice ALWAYS getting rowdy with somebody,Always. Her first instinct is to insult verbally and jump up immediately after. Since her first season. If you ask me they should've both been gone.
I love how Bambi is not backing down, never thought I would be on her side over Spice
Girl f*ck Spice. Bambi just be real.
As a black woman, if I heard that my friend called someone a racial slur, I would talk to them ASAP. Cmon now! 😂
So right, if all three of them in a WhatsApp group together, you mean to tell me that Bambi nor Sierra couldn't just put a short message in the group to ask Erica if what is being said is true? 🤔 It's not like they haven't talked to her. It's not like Sierra didn't know before this trip so what's really going on?🤔  Do they not wanna know what she really said or do they not care (cause they still gonna be friends with her anyway)? Bambi STILL friends with Erica to this day (and getting arrested for her too). While Sierra isn't friends with Erica, that's simply because Erica burned her and made people think she wanted to smash Safaree. If y'all don't care, just say that. Don't lie and be fake
Spice is a real artist trying her best to be friends with these basics lol
Spice you doing way too much for real
I love spice but she was doing a little bit to much 😭 , she did say why are * y’all * so fake meaning multiple people but hey …..
Spice was wrong for that ?
At this point dismiss Spice from the show too please
Kirk next time just take Rasheeda to Bahamas just the two of you nobody else. Birthday vacations are supposed to fun and exciting not all the arguing and drama.
Chile…
Yes indeed 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Bambi and Sierra fake friend's. Spice not wrong for how she feels . They being fake knowing erica called them about it.
Spice calling Bambi a giraffe??? & I dare someone to say it's not derogatory .. what if Bam was insecure about being tall, and it offended her
Spice is turning into the new Rashida. Boss bitch in charge. I was worried for a sec she might go the Karlie Redd route, haha
All these hoes need to stop giving their heart to men who they know be cheating
Bambi is lying thru them big ass teeth!! Like girl u know damn well u talked y’all talked extensively in that jail cell 😒
Kirk never invite the whole cast to Bahamas for Rasheeda b-day. The always arguing and get out of control. SMH
That iconic headturn at 1:17 😂
Bambi weird
Spice is on some different shit...she's an absentee Mom paying child support...most single moms have their children living with them before they talk shit about a single mom...
Erica Mena is going to pop off on the wrong person someday. And it's going to be brutal.
Spice was really doing way too much ! Why are you calling Sierra & Bambi fake for ??????? Are you that mad that they cool with her ?????? Your beef & Your issue is with Erica not them. I’m so sick & tired of Spice. I still want her to get fired for bringing up Erica’s oldest son.
This is my life ok😂😂
It’s the way Yandy & Mendeecees was looking back & forth at Spice & Bambi going at it for me. 😂😂😂
Spice needs to calm all the way down. I am so tired of her on this show. Even if she did tell them, that’s her bestfriend, she doesn’t have to say anything.
First oneee😅
