Area 15 is amazing! I spent 6 hours in the omega mart
Huh!!!! It is done by floating pens😅
She is looking dirty in that dress😅😅😅
Kitni kali hai ye ous dress mai ewwwww😅😅😅
built in socks? EWW I mean it sound comfy but um those will be stinking pretty quick.
How is $34 “affordable” for leggings??? That’s ridiculous and not affordable for most people, including me. I know I won’t be trying that brand😂😂😂
I think I know where the glowing tiles are I think they're in Korean or Japan or China
Omg I have the shark too also for the shark get the extra large one
2025 my first time with tiping 😊
yeah those shaped tunnel lights were in my dollar store for $3 like 4 years ago i have the star :D
I love pickles💚
8.20 if you let them set you can play whit them
Did you know u can make temporary tattoos with the floating names thing. (I have it.)
Well with the shark body only going about halfway up, you kinda look like a mermaid, lol. And I'm actually a bit disappointed the drumstick wasn't turkey-flavored, I kinda wanted to see how that tasted, heh.   ^_^
10:58  I can almost smell the pickle and I’m gagging 😂😊
My favorite leggings are from Walmart and they are made by no boundaries and they are made out of polyester and basically they are for lounging and not for exercising in and they're only $7.99 each
Hi hope! I'm wondering what happens if the socks in the "crock-socks get dirty
Love all the stuff sooo cool love the hair lol
The stress ball shape… 🤨
They look like ugs 0:14
I’ve been watching this channel and I never realized that this is the second secret channel😅
Can I have the shoe with the
Hope put the lights under your hair
Hi
Some of the things you do just seem overly geared towards children. I guess that's who your channel is really for. I just find you bring so much of the inexperienced optimism of childhood oftentimes, like the fiber optic hair idea. I guess since I'm 40, I shouldn't be watching videos aimed at a child audience if I expect realistic adult level concepts that make sense for adults. Oh, well....
Can I have you in Roblox please 🙏
you can use normal whiteboard markers and a steel spoon also for the floating in water stuff but u gotta put the spoon a lil slower if ur gonna use stell
Where do you get the shark onesie it is so cool!
I bet $100 that the wig is supposed to be Ursula🦑🐙🫧🌊

I’m commenting super late on this video, but they sell fiber optic whips for raves. Mine is 5ft long. You could probably take the handle off of just a couple of those to make a better, longer fiber optic wig!

With the floating marker you don’t actually need anything special just a spoon 🥄 bowl of water 🥣 and whiteboard markers
I  don't  know  what your  talking about I  found them
you can turn any Gummy into marshmallow btw with heat and a mixer (future live Idea)
Your crafty you can cover the clip bit to muffle the light at the top in the wig.

Hi, I really love your videos. My name is Mila. I hope you can put. I hope you can stitch stuff in your video.
You should transfer the dry erase image and see if it will go onto your fingernail
I think you should have turned all the clips on and then glued them on to like a wig cap or maybe like underneath a baseball cap

Leo was so excited by the corn.  I thought he was going to jump!

The light up hair with the beanie is giving Jellyfish from Shark Tale

Annoying note: check product labels especially with gummies and make sure there’s no xylitol in it as it’s really bad for dogs.  Ps: I work at a dog rescue
She reminded me of the jellyfish 🪼 from shark tale 😂😂😂 with the beanie & light up extensions 😂😂

Jesus loves you and He is coming back soon, everyone will be judged!
OK but where did you get the shoes... why do you not link any of the products
She got fake ugg Tasman
She kinda looks like dany gonzalez
....those crocs probably smell terrible if anyone naturally has smelly feet 🤮
my first thought was Curella DeVille for the wig for HAlloween-- thats my guess
Am I the only one that thinks the “swan stress ball” looks more x rated?
The swan stress thing...um...only me seeing something else? 😂
I remember colorful koala Those were some of my favorite videos.
I had a coffee table that had that  cool illusion it was so cool😂 2:24
Girl… $50 is the average price of crocs
You shoud make  NAILS
HER NAILS HIT THE SPOT!
😮❤❤❤❤
I’ve been to area 15 and it is literally amazing
When you put the hat on you reminded me of those jelly dishes from shark tale 😂😂
Alibaba has the dance floor LOL
@colorfulkoala you need sweatshirts that match the new dark jade color.
Hey yo that corn in the way you touching it
Like your heart mirror I got my son a octagon ones at Walmart and they had others to go with it so you can hang them on your wall and they move with sound they are cool
If you think the shark  blankets cool google Grizzly bear sleeping bag 😊
They are hug slip sock Croc
ok but the shoe aaaaaaaaaaa
Hi hope! Love ur vids:) anyways, I was wondering if u could review Arabian style clothing?
You can Google 'led tunnel floor tiles' and tons of them pop up. I really hope you get some they look amazing!
You should go to the world tiniest not even many brands like the world's tiniest things for ants like for aunt It's so tiny that you can see the thing But you can't see it like a a tiny tiny.
Your may favorite YouTuber
can someone pleaaaaase tell me where her blazer is from 😍😭
If you try to wear your wig like that glowing around the sides, it’s a nice idea but it will look like you’re balding at the top lmao
Can you buy some more lost packages? Miss those videos❤
Those sock shoes are meant to be worn with socks under it’s not a sock less shoe it’s just the look
A couple of those things are should I say X rated? Maybe it’s just my dirty mind?😂
So
No I have the same problem
Video
You said it on one
I got in your phone number
Can you link those crocs with socks? They were kinda cute 🤣
https://youtube.com/shorts/bPXGouy8EkY?si=cJIV5R9VhTE2dGoa
Omg... She brought out her doggies Out At the first part of the video
Paint the clips with a thin coat of white paint and it will dim the light that comes through them
Area 15 is an amazing collaboration of a ton of artists and the group is called Meow Wolf.  There are a few of these amazing installations around America.  Absolutely incredible. Wish they could design me a home!
When you wore the hat and the Fibre optic hair clips, the first thing I thought of was the jellyfish from Shark Tale😂
I love Hope and her video ideas however I wish she’d stop buying sooo much plastic trash esp from China that will take 500 years to biodegrade and will end up in a huge landfill. I wish she’d try out more sustainable items like Mia maples has.
Can you do a baby food taste test with Leo  and Tyler  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Not gonna say what the “swan” looks like 😅😂😅😂
Word and image soup would be great for kids who weren’t feeling well
Hi
where are the slipper shoe socks from?
Hope, sweet pickles actually exist!
I was literally waching you eat the gummy pickle and I was drinking a micdonlads smoothie and started gaging after I took a sip 😭😭😭😭😭
The whole shark thing cracked me up. So funny! Love your channel. It’s always so fun to watch. ❤
Not me yelling at the Google microphone because it just said scope instead of Hope scope
you are looking phenomenal in that bodysuit! body is bodying!
Are you going as an angel?😇🥳🥸🤪
Your content never misses
I’m going to Vegas on Friday so I’m deff going lol
What if you put some white electrical tape on the clips to make the light more diffused when you put them in the wig?
Can u tank me to the eras tour in Louisiana pls that’s my birthday month
The fact that I was so excited when you said Colorful koala because it reminded of old Hope videos!❤
Omg where is that sofa from? I need to knoooow ❤❤❤
just by the way… you can do the floating marker thing with a bowl of water, and dry erase board markers and any random spoon
I hate crocs
My name made it into the bowl!! 🎉
the floor tiles camed up straight away for me with "LED floor tiles"Would love to actually see them tested o:
You look like the jelly fish from shark tales with those things in your hair with the hat on! 😂
Is anyone else disappointed she didn't give credit to Meow Wolf for Area15?? @meowwolf for the incredible interactive art installation...
U should do another trying viral skin care
Hope! be super careful giving gummies to puppo, xylatol(a sweetner) is super toxic to fur babies so just make sure thats not in it first <3
Hope looks like one of the jellyfish from shark tales with the hat and hair lights on 😭 I can’t
Are you going to be esla
Omg you NEED to visit actual Omega Mart!!
Hope remember when you did that vid on your main channel*Rating 10 popular youtouber brands* I think it was you said you will dye all your hair pink if that vid got 200 000 likes and it got 208 000 likes you don't have to do it if you don't want to  just saying (really love your vids)❤❤❤❤❤

The heart mirror has a clear blue plastic sheet that you're supposed to peel off
чисто галоши купила

just incase people dont know omega mart is a arg (altinate reality game) in which there are hidden rooms and secret places you can explore with a story line that you have to descover yourself throughout. its by the company meow wolf
Yes I went to Area 15 loved it 😂🥰. My first time on an airplane was to Vegas ❤❤❤❤❤
How do you wash them
Watched with my baby girl and she kept smiling the whole time. She’s a little hopescope fan😊
🎶Omega Mart! You have no idea what’s in store for you!!!🎶
the  croc shoes what do you do when the sock gets stinky like how do you wash it? yeah no thanks cute BUTTTTT no.
the white wig with the fiber optics attached would fit right in with Area 15
What are the shoes called and where did you get them from?
Hope you need to test activewear from a store called Kyodan  I would too see it ❤❤ I follow both of your channel Love you so much 😊
The swan looked like a male appendage! Tell me I’m not the only one to see the similarities?!

Am I the only who thinks that the stress ball looks like an AirPod
Hope!! Would that shark blanket fit someone 5ft tall?!  Cuz I’m super short but have been wanting that shark blanket!!!
Mom where is the pink hair 😭 I’m waiting
For the hair extensions, you have to lift a few layers of hair then clip it on or else it will look weird.
You looked like the prettiest, glowy-ist jellyfish with the hat!! Lol
Ok .... but .... how do you clean the CROC SOCKS?!?
I saw these floor tiles in the hgtv Barbie dreamhouse remodel
I SOOO need the sock/crocks!! The love Crocks but hate that my feet sweat and I get blisters from Crocks! This solves that problem!!!
That would mean if u got the slipper shoes in every color of the rainbow ( red orange yellow green blue purple pink) it would be 350$
hope i love you! you make my day thank you xxx 😘
OMG, I'm going to Omega Mart next week (first time in Vegas).
You look a little like a jellyfish with the lights and the hat.

With the hat and the fibre optic extensions, you looked like one of the rasta jellyfish from A Sharks Tale

Yesterday
Yesterday
I love your hair style 😊
I’ve got some cream for ya.
You can get actual crocs with fluff inside
I literally just googled LED dance floor and it came up on eBay for around 200$ a tile
I need the shark blanket. I'm 5ft so feel it's fine for me.  Great video
You sure 😅make me laugh. Don’t get the chance much.   Never do I not laugh watching you!😂
First thought for your Halloween character was Kida from Atlantis? 👀 7:17
A witch

hi
Are you going as Elsa?
What type of spoon is that?
I CANT WAIT FOR THE HALLOWEEN VIDSSSS
Did no realise her saying d*ck to the pickle 🥒 😂
For the tunnel light I’m pretty sure your supposed to take off the blue thing on the mirror but idk
Hear me out. Anybody remember the jellyfish from Shark Tale?? Wish I could post the picture. Totally looks like it with lights and hat on head 😂😂
Pink hair
you can paint the clip in part of the extensions with white nail polish to try and block the light from showing and help them blend into the wig better! 💖
the glow hairextensions made you look like those jellyfish guys from Sharktale  Edit: Esp with that hat on!
I love hope 💝💝💝. Hope from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩
i'm an og!!
I went to area 15, and went to omega mart, so fun!
Lol, the Swan thing is based of a sculpture by David Shrigley
The extensions with the hat are giving Shark Tale
The fibre optic extensions paired with the beanie at 7:03 reminded me of the rasta jellyfishes from Shark Tale lol
I am dieing over the LED hair. With the hat on you looked like you had a Jellyfish on your head! 😂😂😂 I love your videos you always make me laugh
Nope e Terrell I am wondering that too
What was the cloud thing she held in the thumbnail? I didn't see it in the video?
🎉
2:13 she's literally giving Left Shark at the Katy Perry superbowl halftime show <3 thank you for reminding me of that meme
When you said the corn gummy taste like popcorn, I was eating popcorn.😂
Hope you have a good day!!
hi hope i know its late but i really want to know if i won any hair curler i mean its been 3 weeks... so if you could please let us know if we won or not
Hey hope! Just wanted to give an fyi that some gummies contain xylitol. You might’ve checked the ingredients before feeding a small piece to you puppers but incase you didn’t know I wanted to share that 🥰 love your videos
Who here thought “oh, a jellyfish!” As soon as she turned off the lights lol
does anyone else think she looks like that Jamaican guy from shark tale with the fibre optic hair extensions??
Crocs are also $50 so I mean at least they’re not overpricing them?
The LED hair clips, I would definitely think fairy flower crown. Place the clips all under the flowers/foliage of the crown, then place on head. I think it'd be beautiful!
Apparently you can find the flooring at event decor direct
Awww this made my day! I didn’t see your live but my name is Alexis 😂so it’s like I was included 😊 9:50
Royal high hair be like 4:36
OMGGGG I LOVE UR HAIR ❤❤❤❤

Американцы узнали про ✨галоши✨

Where can I find those croc shoes? I want them!

Sup
The light up extensions with the hat was reminding me so much of the jelly fish in “A sharks tale”
You could put an opaque tape on the hair clips so they aren’t so bright
Know why you like the swan thing. Tip it another way and it looks very much like a male appendage.
Omega Mart is apart of meow wolf and meow wolf is my favorite place to go too glad you went!😂😁😁
I love Area 15, I did Omega Mart once but we ran out of time to fully explore, but Area 15 is a great place to visit in Vegas.
The tunnel mirror light is literally in every Indian wedding Dj !
Scrocks
You can tell she did the curling iron video before filming some of this😂
My ADHD just loves these videos where you just open/try random stuff 😅❤
Title: I BOUGHT PRODUCTS Me: no way 😂
PLEASE LMK WHERE U GET THE SHARK BLANKETS I NEED ONE AND WHAT SIZE
you are  rocking that hairstyle hope :)
Elsa definitely
I thought you were going to die your hair all pink
Just wondering how you wash the built in socks for the slip on shoes?
Lmaooo YOUR HAIR TAKING PEOPLE OUT 😂
She can buy optical wire and light  separately though the optical wire bundle is easy  to find anywhere
Where are the links to the products?....
ok here me out, yk abt those croc sock shoes... socks get stanky idk abt that 😐
When you try to sneak in an ad haha you’re a sweetheart I love you ❤  I hope you have just the best day ( whenever you read this :) )
Those shoes Just remind me of uggs just without the socks
Your vids r the best hope so much fun to watch
What’s the name of the crock sock shoe thing?
They used that flooring in the HGTV Barbie Dream house if you haven’t watched
Try 3D infinity LED dance floor In search
Love from Pakistan 🇵🇰
I'm new to your channel. I think you are hilarious, and so far, I have loved watching you. Haven't made it to a live yet, but hoping to in the near future. Keep being weird!!!!!!
2 am in Perth Western Australia and this 57 yr old grandma to 6 can't sleep because I have a strategic leadership program to finish for Execs, so I visit Hope and once again I am both distracted and reassured that globally we have raised a generation of fun,  interesting and intelligent women.  Love, love, love your channel! (Also about to finish my version of your "Dead Husband" gown thanks to you❤)
Expensive plastic does not exist.
The shoes with socks Sketchers does too lol
Cool
It's like a Croc Ugg hybrid. A Crugg, if you will. :)
Idea! Cover the clips with white duct tape to lessen the glow of the clip.
You are the best 💗
I want to get the shoes with the socks. What are they called?
I have no idea where she got the shoes from and googling doesn't help. I love them surprisingly. I thought they were gonna look like grandma shoes lol. I do wonder how they get cleaned tho...?
For the fiber optic clips, wrap the clip head with white electrical tape - that should block the excess light.
I want to send Hope some corset stockings that i make (Quinnzels Creations). Does anyone know if she has a PO box?
Hope makes my day
Been here since legging review days and you introduced me to colourfulkoala! My favorite bike shorts and leggings are from them!
Those shoes do look mad comfy
Scrox. That should be the croc shoes name. Carry on. 😉 😊💛
Omg, I love the shark. It could totally fit me. Where'd you buy it?
I love the shark blanket
I have no idea how I came across your videos, but you’ve become like a comfort for me.
does any one know wear the shoes are from
With the weird gummies you could do a “trying weird foods/candy” video
You should layer them Hope ❤❤❤
Can we just say hope is so pretty 😍
the gummies should be in smaller size so at least it would be fun for snacking
Use tan or white duck tape on the top side of the clips to maybe help with the brightness
She spends money on products and use honey app just like me
She’s a super human  by catching the battery’s
They way she did her hair and makeup she is sooo pretty
That was fun. Thanks Hope.
She should be a shark for Halloween
Hope I laughed so hard when you put the hat on because HAHAHA you remind me of the jellyfish from Shark Tale 💀😭
The sharke one we know damn well it’s not about the height
“Tell me why I thought I could make this”  It’s a gift and a curse girl, I feel you 😭
You know those robes that are like fuzzy. I think they're called like dead husband robes or something. I wish that they had a tiny version for kids and ones that weren't like 100 bucks 😢
Have you seen Shark Tale? You wearing the wig and the clip ins look like the jelly fish. That is all 😂
I love the shark blanket
I’m gonna come up with a edit later
I was on the floor thinking the wig won't work but it looked so cool 😉
I found the dance floor lights, just look up tunnel light dance floor 😅
You neeeeeeeeed to make your own clothing websiteeeeeeeee (like if you agree)
Crocs? Socks? Scrocs??
You could put white electrical tape over the clip part of the hair extensions to hide some of the glow
The shoes you showed first look like the UGGs Tasman X Rainboot
Hello
Hi
OMG the blow up couch?! I used to have so much blow up furniture as a kid/pre-teen!🥹
Should have titled the video "watch me animorph into a jelly fish" 😂😂😂
you look different
OMG, Colorful Koala!!!! I remember! I miss the front porch try on. 😊
❤
Until you feet sweat like crazy because they are plastic shoes.
I have been a fan since then and your hair looks really pretty with your leggings
I find it amusing that you think 50 dollars for a pair of shoes is a little expensive. 😂
“And then the really strong di-“ as she sets the pickle back down
Leo is so cute
I love her friend 😊, sorry i forgot her name.
I want you to bring back the activewear reviews. You were the best!!!!!
My boyfriend called those scrocks. I need them too. Where do we find them?
Amazing ❤
Leo is such a cute poochie ❤
How are you going to wash the socks inside that Crocs?
Is the ColourfulKoala from Australia if so I have never heard about it❤
I love your videos
When did Hope get Chiclet veneers for teeth?? 😂😂
She’s going to be Elsa for holloween
Please change your hair style 😢😢😢that lil curly Mmnh hell naw
Luv you hope :D
The fiberoptic hair lighting is a cool idea but you should set them all to be the same setting. If you go with the white wig, you should do all white lighting or maybe even blue. Do whatever inspires you of course, but I personally think having them all set the same would look very elegant. And having all white lighting in the frosty, white wig will have a "magical" effect versus the rainbow rave party, LOL.
You are my favorite YouTuber ever. Thank you for being such a great person and interesting YouTuber. I have had Covid for the past week and you helped me through it. I never got bored watching your videos. Thank you you so much for amazing and funny video. I hope you read this and comment. Love you so much!
come back to area15 i work night shift there it would be awesome to see you there
My son was begging me to get him a shark blanket now 😂
Love your videos but my mom wants to know if the Koala leggings stuff Comes in teens and adult sizes
Dirty minds by the swan.. Down here⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️
OMG i love your vidios
How do you wash the socks in the shoe? 🤢
Omg I think went on ur live bc her names Alexis and she told me she was on a hopescope live!!!🙃🙃
"Croc shoes"....these are kind of expensive at $50 😂☠️ clearly she has never bought crocs before. Especially the fleece lined crocs😂
Name the video that you don't know where it belongs tick tick made me bye it haul!!
Anyone getting reminded of the real vs gummy food
I think your halloween costume is Daenerys Targaryen or Storm from the X-men!!!
Thanks for sharing all these. I feel like I can still get the experience without the pay.
Dance floor tiles that's where ya buy them awesome light up thingys😊
Wouldn’t built in socks get really gross!?😳🙄😐 you can’t wash them if they are part of the shoe. Ewww ick 🤢😵‍💫
Omg I was not expecting that gummy turkey leg to be one giant turkey leg 😂😂
Guesses for her Halloween costume 👇
❤❤❤❤❤
You shouldn't give your dog random stuff. There can be dangerous ingredients in there like onion.
Thanks for the discount, I love the one pair of their leggings that I own and was just waiting for a deal to buy more
Does anyone know where the links for the products are??
Colourfulkoala are my favorite leggings 😍 I miss the legging queen reviews 🥹
I think the heart light mirror has a film on it you pull off and will make it clearer
Win your free “early hopescope” ticket here
Please be careful giving your dog anything gummy! Occasionally they sweeten them with xylitol which is ☠️ for dogs! Love your channel!
Hooray I love colorfulkoala leggings because of you!!! Hooray for finally making sports bras!!! I'm a very happy girl!
where is the pink hair hope???🤨🤨
I don’t even look at the title anymore. I see Hope, I click!
Can we all just appreciate how amazing hope is and how big her smile is whenever I see her smile I always catch my self smiling to x❤❤❤
Let’s be grateful that hopescope buys stuff for us and sometimes sell them for us!
Does anyone notice she looks like Veronica dunne or as ik her as Marisa from kc undercover
I have a pair of bright pink shoes like your cream ones and mine are from Uggs
Please stop promoting and buying Temu. Workers need to stop being abused.
Hope you are so beautiful, please don't loose weight. This thick body suits you😍
So... when do we get to see ALL pink hair?!
I think your gonna be cruella de ville
❤❤❤
I love you videos so much!😊
I love these videos I want to meet you
Elsa
me from the picture:MIKU HAIR
Just cut a hole in the bottom of the shark so your feet aren't cramped in there and it should just lay over your feet😊
You could cover the extension clips with a tape that is close to the color of the wig and see if that dims the light
I wonder if she’s gonna be Rheanyra for Halloween.
"you know the every-flavored beans? kinda tastes like that." 😂😂
Omg I also have that skin xD   If you ever decide to play with subscribers please let me know! 🩷😁
More of these weird videos they are the best
Everytime Hope says somethjng is expensive i always think it’s above 100.
You have to sue your hair all pink remember
she looks like ernie and bernie from shark tales with those light up extensions and the hat😭🪼
While eating thay gummy pickle idk why you looked liked penny from bbt
dang i went to vegas twice and i didnt know about this place 😩
i always enjoy watching hope play with fun finds!
i think you could make a really stunning festival flower headpiece with the fiber optic extensions. I'm picturing a full flower headband, with the clips tucked behind flowers.   you could really make something stunning!
You are going to be Addison from zombies for your Halloween costume
When you had those lights and the hat on, you looked like the jelly fish from the movie cartoon Shark Tale.
Are you going as Elsa? @hopescope
I have been to Omega Mart twice and it is so fun and interesting.
I bought colorful koala leggings off Amazon in like 2019 for around 13 dollars. 36 seems pricey!
How did you style your hair so beautiful? 👀🥰
I think the shark blankie may be for kids? It seems so small
What if you put white duct tape over the clips to match the wig but kind of “black out” the actual clips?
Peel off the blue film on the optical illusion heart thing
Hi hope I love your videos a ton  AND I Will like More like these
The shoes are on temu
I love this channel so much ❤❤
The actual croc brand needs to make those shoes
i sooo want the shark
🌈
Are you going to be a ghost 👻😂😀
What boutique did u get the croc socks my mom would love them
Hi hope love the shark blanket so cute and I love hove much effort you put your videos😁
Hey hope! Did you know your stress all is a boom-boom and chickadees?
But how do you clean the croc socks lol
I love hopes hair
Hope could you do a video when you use and review viral TikTok skincare/ makeup like drunk elephant,glow recipe and more I would love to see that I love watching your videos and I love your fun energy!💗
I need that demented swan
NOM✨👹👺NOM👹✨👺NOM👺👹✨
I’m here
They seriously used that did disco floor on the Barbie Dreamhouse makeover on HGTV.
If you did not come from tiktok you can like this comment
❤❤❤ love it
can you shave your hair and die it pink
These are my favorite types of videos. Thank you Hope!! 🩷🩶🩵
take the blu off on the heart mirror
2:24 there’s something on temu pretty similar to this and i think it’s really cool and it’s like roses and there’s an infinite amount of roses in the background like this one i think it’s pretty cool
where did you get the shoes?
I missed Hope sm 🥹
You are an amazing person don't be afraid of what people think of you 😊
As someone who is 4"11 the shark onesie would be so cozy!! I just might have to get one for myself. Love these videos!! 🦈
Aren’t you supposed to dye your whole head pink? Waiting!
you can make these optical illusions quite easily lamps yourself! It's just an LED strip and a certain type of sheet on top. I saw it done to a table once Just cut out the middle part, put the LED strip around the edge and cover it with glass. Add the sheet on top of it and voilá! Looks like a bottomless table. Super cool and easy to do!
You should customize the croc shoes! I feel like that white is just begging to be painted on! Lol
Here within two hours gang 👇🏻
Love the outfit 😍😍
Hi ya, Hope! It's your biggest SENIOR fan here, AGAIN! I have LED shoes laces that I wear when I go to Disneyland! I get a ton of compliments EVERYTIME!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉 oh,yeah... they are from Amazon😅😅
It my birthday today
Be careful sharing gummies with your dog.  If they contain xylitol it can kill him.
This would be cute to taylor swift
Luv ur hair and I love all ur Chanel’s
Hey hope scope there called: Interactive Light & Sound Panel - Infinity for the big ones
Your tha best
Hi  hope
I Have Been To The Mega Mart In Vegas With My family And it was So FUN!
Slayyyy two hours
Why does Leo look so small here 😂
I got those “croc-sock” shoes on clearance from ugg for like $35. They only had green, red, and yellow left. So as much as I think that this product that you got might’ve been a scam, I also think that maybe you ordered this when the croc thing kind of came out which they were probably the same price if not more I don’t know the quality of yours, but the quality of mine was really nice.
I need! More videos like this!🩵 Its so fun to wach
I love your vids ❤️
You got ripped off with the heart mirror I got that at five below for 5 $
Hi Hope!! it looks like there’s a protective film on your mirror still, you should be able to carefully peel it off for a nicer mirror finish
Maybe you can paint or put some type of sticker to cover the light the clip of the extension 😊
Ok the hair is interesting..
Thanks!   LOVE YOUR VIDEOS SO MUCH !!! I couldn’t stop laughing at this last video  …the shark though !!! Lol !! ❤😅😂❤❤
Love your hair like this so much more! It really suits you ❤❤
HER HAIR IS SO PRETTY NVM SHE IS
Girl so we going to dye all your hair pink or not
Hope in those Shark onesies had me howling 😂😂😂
Oh it’s on a stick and everything ✨  -hope
Am I the only one who wonders how you get that sock part of the shoe sock thing really clean?
Hope you should totally do a larger series where you visit all of the Meow Wolf locations! Omega Mart is obviously the one in Vegas, but they have a bunch all around the West! I went to the one in Denver and it was literally amazing!! it would be cool to see your reaction to them!
OHMYGOSH! I GOT THE PICKLE AND CORN GUMMY TOOOOOO
aww i’m late
First hour gang lol
Shark
The sham is so cute
1 hour gang 😊
I love your hairrr

I messed up. I meant to say this video got posted an hour ago and it already has 4K likes.😮🎉
The shark onesie reminds me of Charlotte dobre
This video got posted an hour ago and nobody has 4K likes😮
Olmg
Thank you so much for entertaining us when we’re bored or when we are happy family we’re excited. Thank you so much.
I love your videos they are so amazing
Hey maybe you could put some white paint over the actual clips, so they don't glow that brightly ^^
I wanted to pull off the foil from the ❤ mirror sooo badly 😂 love all these!
love your vids
🎉 M E O W   W O L F 🎉 THAT IS AREA 15/OMEGA MART!!! 😺

Hey Hope! 😉
Good afternoon Hope!!!  I loved everything you got , but the lights in the wig looks amazing!!!  Thank you so much for sharing with us, and I hope you have a Blessed weekend!!!
Slay
I love your videos
i think that hope should try womans best
Try take some white tape and stick it over the light where the clip is and diffuse the brightness.
Hope really needs to lose some weight. She used to be so beautiful, now, because of the weight, the girl looks so old and heavy, and those fat fingers are going to give me nightmares... Please!
Hi hope I'm a big big big fan
Amazingly done
Noo I am 1 hour late
Hey Hope! Love the video. Where did you get the pink blow up couch ?!! I’m obsessed
I’m taking attendance
leo had me cracking up wene he wanted the pickle

Old Hope: It girl leggings 🖤 Current Hope: Rich aunt feathery robe 💖 New Hope:.....? Ice queen white and platinum with LED 🤍
I'm in the process of making a pattern of the shark blanket for one of my kids. I'll have to let you know how it turns out.
Love your videos! ❤
Paint the clips white this way they will be less bright
That heart light tho  lovveee
Hey hope I hope your the first youtuber that answers this messages I just wanted to say that I love your videos and you’re my favorite YouTuber and I also just wanted to say that my birthday is on August 27 by the way when is your birthday?
Thoes who didn’t come from ticktock are allowed to like this comment
Just a reminder to make sure the product doesn't contain xylitol before you share them with your dog. It is very toxic! ❤🐶
Love you and keep up the good work
I love her hair
A colourful koala sponsorship, Old hope would be so happy
Hi hope love your vids
when her hair went into the bowl LMAO
Love you hope your my favorite YouTuber keep up the great work!
Love u
I love your videos so much you make me laugh ❤️😂
That's so funny how we all watched it not even a day before it came out
You could of layered your hair like on the wig and people wouldn't see the top
How are you washing the shoes with built in socks. 😵‍💫  people feet stink, gotta wash those somehow
Love your videos ❤️💕
Heheheheheheheheheheh
I love the shark blanket
You're taller and a few pounds heavier than that grill who had the shark outfit on.  No shade, just facts.  We are not 1 size fits all.  I'm the same, what fits most, doesn't fit me
I want the shark blanket spoil bad its so cute!
Who else just love hope 😢❤😊
Your hair and makeup during the try-on are gorgeous! Which curling iron did you use for those curls?! 😍
Love uhh hopeeee 🎉❤
The crocs with socks...how would you wash the socks when they got dirty?  Or do you wear socks with them, which defeats the purpose?
early for once
Area 15 is so fun Ngl
You can also use a white board marker and write on the inside of a sink, then turn the water on slowly, and they will float too! I did that as an experiment for my 4 year old and she LOVED it!
Area 15 is only one of the locations! It’s run by something called Meow Wolf and each location is a different theme. There’s one in Santa Fe, Denver, Las Vegas, and one coming soon in Houston!
Hi Hope my name is Jasmine I'm a huge fan of your videos and your amazing energy. Love you!!❤
Hope I am so FREAKING obsessed with ur vids LIKE OMG🤓
I mean, SERIOUSLY, the amount of work, time, and money you put into all your videos just for us is truly admirable! Keep up the amazing work sweet girl! 🥰❤️
You look like a jellyfish with the hat and led lights :D
I have a shark blanket and i love it but i also had to get  2 but love them❤️
Forget about a hat to cover the fiber optic clips. You could use a FLOWER CROWN and wear them out to a concert.
Hi
❤❤❤
I think for helloween you are ganna be a angel cos you are an  angel❤
I feel like me with that nail polish marker id forget and use it as nail polish lol
I have a problem with socks that I can’t wash 😅
