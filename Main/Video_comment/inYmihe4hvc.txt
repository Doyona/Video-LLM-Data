I always get goosebumps when I watch player unveilings at Real Madrid. Hala Madrid 🎉
3:37 “jobe MOVE get over here mum!“
Why do they forget his dad.
Look at his dad. So proud
Hala Madrid
Who’s here after he won the champions league?  👇
Was it so hard for Sky to get an interpreter who could have translated what Mr Perez was saying at the moment?
Jude Bellingham is a Real Gentleman!!!
why does Jobe look so angry😭.
Palabras del presidente del Real Mádrid
Hala Madrid ☆
I LOVE JUDE
Here after he wins the El Classico for madrid  Hey Jude ❤
Bring it home Bellas ❤
What a player 🤍🤍🤍🤍
Can Joe come and play for Brentford FC.
Promo>SM
LMAOOO jude is reading a script again and jobe’s rbf is killing me 🤣🤣🤣🤣 love these two for real !! so proud of u jude 💍❤️
HALA MADRID
6 given, 5 robbed The other 3? 4-1
2:31 ok but I thought he was handsome😢😮  have you seen his brother😂😻🥵
Liverpool play in white now? 😂😂😂😂😂😂  Deluded dippers.
Bellinghams idol = zidane
Madrid should get more Spanish players! Shit's starting to look like the france team fr. Embarrassing
You're Welcom champion
I honestly think it was Bellinghams fault kane missed his penalty against france
Respect to Jude Family..🙏🏾
If you’re looking for an edge in sports betting, AWAKENBEERUS is your secret weapon. Trust me, I’ve won big following his predictions!!!
Real Madrid trying to choose their midfield 🗿🗿🗿🗿
Real madrid midfield is full of winners this new player will destroy real madrid midfield next year...
Dude is way too good for his age, he is at Mbappe level
So a mature head on young shoulders
ach, come on now, gone for the big money and easier life,  less matches ,some would say and why not,  but really not as tough or as competitive as the EPL, so can he really  be world class, ,if he helps England to a trophy then i might change my mind,
Negro Britannicus for Sugar Daddy Perez, another abomination deal. Soon it will be no spanish players in Spain, but it is indifference for bunch of sephardic jew who runs this club and this country.
His parents raised him well and look at him!! Incredible career already at 19 🙌
When he’s fit I’ve got this feeling he’s going to hit the ground running. And tear up the la liga!
Can’t wait for  it to be the same as beckham and all you can do is join average teams after. Disgrace. Won’t watch him play in any England fixture
Benevito
Hola JUDE
jude will make life hard for La liga teams...
Cant liverpool just sign his brother? 😢
Doesn't he want to prove himself in the best league ? Avoiding the prem for some reason 😂
Madrid love to pay over the odds for players🤣
In English please you clowns!
Vamos Madrid!!! Hala vikingos!!!
The white guy is that Jude real dad or step dad, I was a bit shocked when seeing he has a white dad but then again I might be wrong
Bro is already looking like the future Real Captain!
What a achievement and still a teenager! Love seeing our younger generation have the balls to go abroad, we have some phenomenal young talent that would have won two international finals if that tactically impaired idiot wasn’t petrified of players with skills like him & foden etc , but I digress , to go Birmingham to Dortmund is impressive but to Madrid already is mental , England captain and most caps record easily possible, 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
Virtually stole him at that price
Marcia Too bad Dayton didn't get to live out his dreams. This would have been a great accomplishment for him if it wasn't for bad parents. I'm so proud and excited for my son. Just wanted to let you know that I'm in a happy place. My son is playing Ball. And your is well you know 🤗 So continue to pray for your son. So I can glorified the accolades that man has blessed my son with. God knows your heart and he will prevail for you and your son in do time. But until then, my Son is better than yours 😘
Esse Pérez era pra ser investigado pelo FBI urgente!
Lol Jobe is there too
Money grabbing bastad
This kid will make it big. He is really good quality
Hala ma what???
Congra❤👍💯⚽️
Baller 🔥
Christiano knew the language. Jude should’ve gone to city.
This is amazing, but the number i was expecting was 23 like beckham.😅
Bellingun
Wait what. He's only 19
im not gonna lie, as a Liverpool fan i'm disappointed we couldn't get him (though i understand why), but i wish him the best of luck for him at madrid and hope to see him flourish under ancelloti and those who may come after. Such a special player.
Congratulations Jude
Proudest dad moment ever
Jobe is unreal
Welcome to Real Madrid. Best wishes, Jude.
Bench player
Hopefully he makes more of an effort to integrate with the local language and culture than many English players do.
If he came to England he would have ruined his career, he made the right choice and going to Madrid now he will have a great career and retire with 5 champions league medals and so much more
That smile from his dad at 2:33, you can feel how proud he is at that moment.
They’ll destroy him like the did to bale hazard Beckham Real Madrid is a career killers
This guy is gonna nail it! Welcome t Real Jude!
19 years. he’s an icon for young english ballers
The next Lampard and will probably be even better than him, I thought Benzema leaving screwed up Real Madrid forever but this is a new beginning 🇪🇸⚪️
Were the greatest, Man City is the greatest
the 5 is a hard one to carry. wish him the best.
Do Birmingham City get a cut?
Imagine being 19 years old and signing for Real Madrid, every kids dream
That thumbnail looks straight outta Fifa 24 😄
One Bellingham goes to real madrid on the same day the other one goes to Sunderland.... What a difference of quality
“Greatest FC in the history of the game”. Historical fact right there.
His price was so, cheap for ability, age, potential, length of timer probably at club and if they was to sell him probably make a huge profit, if dortmund was got at negotiating they would of got £200, going be the goat for midfield
How would he cope with the language barrier?
Laddo can't believe it himself. Fair play son.
1:50 One of my favourite players growing up, Real Madrid legend Raul! He’ll succeed there. He got the character. Can’t forget Dortmund made him captain for a couple games at his very young age, too!
The manner in which he gracefully pulled his mom closer to him during a picture-taking ceremony speaks volumes about his remarkable personality. At just 19 years old, he exudes a captivating uniqueness that sets him apart.
Another player to join the racism wagon of la liga
Big feeling hell regret this
I can't help but feel happy and laugh at how much pride must be going through his parents! Especially his dad since he used to play football and would train his little boys only a few years ago to now be standing on the podium for Real Madrid!!! haha
Gareth Bale typing and deleting to warn Jude about Madrid 😂😂😂😂
Ridiculous jb 22 no more
Perfect not too little or too much Speech Jude is perfect
Im a Barcelona and Dortmund fan but can’t help to smile. We want these superstars playing for Barcelona and Madrid. We want those good old days back🙏🏾
Blues at heart 💙🔵 Keep right on brother.     BCFC
You can just feel this is Special, Real Madrid is so Unique hope Barcelona will stop their nonsense and get back to being the most iconic Club in The World... they're missing out on many talents it's crucial cause we're in an era where the quality has reduced and it's harder getting top notch players like how many Bellingham's and Mbappe's can you think of today?
So he's not joining Liverpool then???
Wonderful
another flop in making...like Kros said another hazard
3:30 Blud trying to flex 14 champions league 💀💀😭😭😂😂
Well done Jude!
He'll only be 26 when he joins the toon at the end of his contract 🤣
He'll be an animal in La Liga 🔥
Happy for the lad. KRO!!!
Bellingham has my respect, he chose to play for the greatest club in the world. He didn't run home to England to be comfortable. He wants to win and win big. This will benefit England and might lead to international success if more English youngsters have the bullocks to follow Jude's lead.
May be an unpopular opinion but I have a feeling Bellingham will flop. HARD. Maybe not too much, but if he’s doing *ok* in the Bundesliga, but not doing anything against Bayern? I think it’s the English tax man. If he wasn’t English and like, Portuguese, he would of been like a normal midfielder, kind of like Brandt, his former teammate of Borussia Dortmund.
HIs brother looks like lingard
Im so happy for him and the fact hes gone once again outside of his comfort zone at just 19yrs old when some players double his age don't have the balls to leave they're team
I am pretty sure this young man will excel in Spain. It shows he is ready to push himself in an uncomfortable environment.   If he should have chosen a club in England, the media bias by club affiliation will come down hunting on him.
0121 legend
Hala Madrid ❤️
The kid  is as close to a cert as you can get in terms of becoming a superstar. Such a good head on his shoulders for such a young man.
His brother was in attendance as well.  Awesome
Pedri's going to show him levels
lad has such charisma. very likable wish him the best good luck !
You may think you're happy, but I guarantee you're not as happy as Jude's dad is here at 2:31
Bellingham is gonna wear Zidane’s classic no5 shirt
Perez has done it again super signing
SO happy for him. He's wanted to play for Real Madrid all his life, the best team in the world! I already know he's gonna be a Real Madrid legend! Cant wait till next season!
that is why the 2 big clubs are skint the pressure on him will be immense poor kid
His dad's face..😊
Class... He's going to be so fun to watch with Madrid
Im pretty confident he’ll prove his doubters wrong! Cant wait for next season
The greatest club in the history of the game is Manchester United Jude.
Love it when an English player signs for the biggest club in the World! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 👏
One of the most soulless speeches I’ve ever seen
The new GOAT
Fair Play to the kid, 19 years old and has the world at his feet 🙌 hope he fulfills his potential and becomes a world beater
I love it 🥰😍 hala madrid
19! The lad is unfazed! Confident in his ability! All down to his determination and amazing parents. Good luck Jude. 👊👊👊💪💪💪👏👏👏👏
He be a flop let see 😂😂😂
our new NO 5
Halamdrid
His dad is so happy
He's never been tested in the best league in the world. He won't be truly world class until he plays in the Premier League.
Jobe Bellingham -> Sunderland 🎉 I guess he wants a bigger atmosphere to move on in life. Proud to have Jude’s little brother here, bet he will turn out classy and techy 🔴⚪️👌
His development at Madrid will help win England a World Cup.
Perez Loves Football
Top class Jude he will be a legend
I want to watch Bellingham, Camavinga and Tchouameni
Congrats to him. He'll do a fantastic job at Madrid.
Jobe is literally a carbon copy or jude
Sold his soul for the mighty pound.
I was shocked at first glance I though it was a spurs shirt
What a moment...
what a signing...
This pains me... but it’s the best move for him.. Goodluck Jude
blues better use the money we get to fix the stadium
Hala Madrid 😍❤️
like they coulnt put english captions on no hate
انا ضد طريقة ريال مدريد في تقديم الاعبين تحس فيها نوع من صفقات التجارية . من الافضل ان يدخل مركز النادي ويستقبله المدرب  والعائلة في النادي اكثر احترافية من هذه الطريقة
My man❤😢 proud of you sooooooo much😊🎉❤
It looks like perez skin has deep cuts around his mouth like someone has put knife there
He will not have to be Zidane he will make the number 5 his own!!!! In years to come they will say can the next player live up to the expectations of Bellingham. Bellingham is a young maistro he'll go down in history as one of the best ever to play the gane
So sad that he's left Dortmund 😢, but wish him success at his new club and for 19 years old this man may be England's best player ❤🎉
Proud of this young man well spoken from brimz to dort to Real Madrid, I hope he doesn’t become a flop keep yah up
Pedri Gavi watch out
Sorry he not wearing number 22
Sky Sports not getting onto Zidane’s number, awesome reporting as usual 👀
What a signing😮‍💨
A real brummie, good luck Jude, not a Real Madrid fan, never will be but will chear you on all your life.
KRO.
VAMOS
Cheats cheating again
Grande presi
Pewaris no 5 maestro zizu, selamat for jude Good Luck😎
Bellendingham will flop.
JB5🤍
I was begging for 23  since 1 year but as i opened the app i saw 5 can't get better halla Madrid
what a great player he is. Welcome to real madrid we can't wait to see your magic in the field
We will see if its worth it when they racial abuse him 🤬
Zinedine number 5 jersey very fitting for the young player style of play and movement almost not far apart we wish the young  player success and happiness at Real Madrid.
Hope he does well. He's a fantastic midfielder.
Welcome to historical club
no doubts it’ll prove to be a fantastic choice for his career just like his decision to move to the bundesliga over the prem
Unfortunately, I don't think it will work out for him. I hope it does, but as soon as that fanbase turns on you, then that's all she wrote. The move is too early in his career
Such a professional
Real madrid are the best team in the world
He will be just a flop i guess.
Wishing you well young lads. Big responsibility at such a big club.
2:35 Jude's brother looks like he's jealous to the brim about his brother reaching the pinnacle of european football. Won't be surprised if he joins Barcelona one day and create a whole new version of El Classico
Now get mbappe, Lautaro Martinez, and achraf Hakimi, that's will set us for the next 9 years
Why jude looks so sad lol even his smile drops so fast
Look how nervous he is😂😂 I wasnt nervous at my last school Presentation
Realizing Dortmund sell sancho, haaland and now bellingham..
he will be a flop
The way this kid acts you would think he’s in his prime years can’t believe he’s only 19.
Why didn't you come to Liverpool Jude whyyyy 😢😢
welcome bro :) , enjoy
Walcott, iwobi, kieta, Arthur melo is the real deal. Not him😂😂😂😂😂
I wish him best of luck and pray for god that he will not be next Hazard. 🎉
A new era has begun
No. 5 suits the English Zidane.
👏👏
Crazyyyyyyyyy 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Bellingham is wearing a no 5 shirt which is Zidane's shirt I'm sure Bellingham will replicate Zidane he will learn from Kroos Modric
Great day for the kid wishing him all the best but where are the Dads man what happened to fathers man they're never in the scene.
From Barca fan: I think Jude is really one of the best players at his position
His father can't stop smiling...😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Madrid's midfield is stacked
God bless
Haala madried Ronaldo
3:12   Commenter doesn’t seem to know that the legendary Zinedine Zidane wore the n° 5 at Real Madrid…
I hope Jude smashes it at Madrid it would be so good for England too 💪🏻
Many people says Bellingham is all about the hype created by media. Well you can agree or disagree.  But what cheers me up as a Madridista is the immense maturity he is showing on and off the field. I truly belive he is gonna be a legend. Coz attitude matters more than talent coz thats what  defines you.  Hala Madrid
A certain ZZ wore the No 5. No pressure Jude.
They always get the best players... Masterclass management.
Wonderful family
his dad being so happy filled my heart with joy, hes gonna do amazing here !
Well done jude and the entire bellingham family couldnt of happened to better people ❤
Why does everyone care so much about Bellingham???
his father is so proud 2:31
Good choice honestly. Mpappe should join too.
Bienvenido al mejor club del mundo Real Madrid 🤍
Such a sexy man.
It might be everyone's proudest day, but makes you wonder where Real Madrid got that money from, if last year they were broke, as well as Barcellona ?? Something smells dodgy here !!
Real Madrid is the Greatest football team in the history ❤❤❤❤🤴🤴🤴👑👑👑💯
Fitting that a player who plays so much like Zidane wears no.5. Real are building a tasty team over in Madrid.
Welcome to Liverpoowh😂🤭
20M Kovacic to outshine 100M Bellingham As 20M Gundo outshone 80M Tchoumeni?🤔
Well done young man
Thing is: Does jude understand spanish?
Man that happy smile from his father . You know he is proud of his boy.
il nuovo pallone d oro
He will only get better at Madrid. Especially at midfield, he can learn so much from Luca, Kroos, Fede. Sky's the limit for him!
whenever I see real’s president, im reminded of super league
Look how quickly he's going to speak spanish👏👍👊💯
We no he wanted Liverpool we wanted him.  Wish him luck but am not wishing Real Madrid luck I can’t stand them
Congrats. Proud of You
Good Luck at Real Madrid Bellingham ❤❤❤
Living the dream. Hope he succeeds
Can u imagine cr7 was bought 80m pounds in 2009. Bellingham was 5years old .     Cr7 is the most expensive player ever in history .    Bellingham will make us proud 👏 🥲 🥰 ✌
I hope Jude stays with Real for the next 15 years. Vamos Jude!! Hala Madrid!!!
Balls on this English Lad going to Spain and Germany
Jude will be England’s greatest player ever. He has a different mentality to all the other English players
2:35 didn’t know Jude has a evil twin
Use this as a cry as a liverpool fan button
So weird to see him wearing another number than 22!
Welcome Jude All thanks to Perez
La Liga is dead tho
Hey Jude💜🏳
First things first he needs to learn Spanish and invest in Spain unlike Bale.
Mbappe Must Be So Blind About Rejecting His Dream Club 😏
العربي يصف جمبي 😂
My career played signed for Madrid
Welcome to the best FC in football history, you deserved to wear that jersey with magical number 5 that reminds us our legend Zidan I wish you a career full of success and glory in Real Madrid for very long long time,, hala Madrid ❤
He better hope it goes better than it did for hazard.
Liverpool pinching themselves
First englishman after Beckham to come madrid
Ballon dor 2024 loading for jude bellingham
Fair play Jude 👏🏾🏆
I tolD him to join real Madrid then he leasting me thank you very much bellingham next Zidane 5
D greatest president in sports today
So much of responsibility on 20yo Jude
Good business it was a desperate need of the club anyway wish him well
Too much pressure and exposure on such a young player can be detrimental.  I am afraid he can be the next Sancho instead of Zidane.
He would have been great for Man City or Man Utd and it a shame to not see him in English football and especially playing for England tomorrow. Wish him all the success and looking forward to the YouTube montages of his highlights
Probably the first time a midfielder has worn 5 for them since Zidane and I'm guessing that's 1of the reasons he chose it. RMadrid didn't retire Zidane's number but Birmingham retired Bellingham's lol (by the way I think Bellingham is a very good player and intelligent person and I think he'll do well at RMadrid but I do think it's laughable that Birmingham retired the number he wore).
Why did he not come and prove himself in the premier league i hate english players going to spain  .
At least I know when he comes to Liverpool at that stage we will have more money and we will be able to buy him and have no doubt he will come to Liverpool after real Madrid that's for sure
Very rare indeed that Real Madrid sign an English footballer so that is an achievement in itself. Harry Kane should also snap up the opportunity if offered the chance to play at the Bernabeu.
Mbappe can learn from him. He is wasting his time and career in P$G.
can’t wait to see him play in real
As if a lad from the black country is playing for Real Madrid. Unbelievable achievement
Tbf, that must feel insane. Sitting there knowing you've made it to Madrid. Goodluck mate.
He got Zidane's number👏
Fantastic for the English national team. It would be nice if Harry Kane had the same ambition and went and joined Jude at Real Madrid..
finally, after bale leave we have british player again🎉
Good luck to the boy. Pure class
He said he loved #22 😮
This is great. Having one of the best young milfilder in these era. Welcome to the home of greatness "Jude Bellingham"
Wish him all the best and I hope the Madrid fans treat him well. Known to  be the worst kind of fans, I hope they dont give him the Bale or Hazard treatment
He's such a humble young man. No ego, many of his teammates could take lessons from him.   So good to listening to him. Future captain.
I think we will look bad at this and wonder why the hell did he sign for Madrid
Warra signing for Varpool
What a player. Watched him against Rangers was blown away by him as a player and a man. Best of luck to him!
I support liverpool and i would of done the same thing. real  madrid come calling, you answer
jude bellingham is the perfect fit for this amazing club. very mature, humble, professional in every aspect. amazing talent, dedicated. and he knows that this is an opportunity for a lifetime! joining the most prestigeous club in world football! welcome bellingham and HALA MADRID ☺🤍🤍I love this guy already!!!🤍🤍
Amazing . Great talent truly hope he succeeds ..
Forget  Jude , I just googled that Young Giant standing next to their mom only to find out that he is also playing championship for Sundeland , Physical looks like he''ll be even stronger than Jude, this family might return to same place for another 200mill in 2026
Looks like a Spurs kit from the back here. I wonder why madrid decided for blue on the home kit this year
Can’t wait pedri vs jude is going to be 🔥
Greatest rise to stardom I've seen by a Englishman. Time to be like Bale. N get 🐐 status
Shame that as a Liverpool fan we couldn't get him but glad that he chose Madrid over other PL clubs. Being a 19 yr old and speaking with such maturity after joining a club as big as Real Madrid speak volumes of him 💪🔥
They need to go out and buy a striker
Brother of Jo look not amused
Back to follow Real Madrid again my beloved laliga team
This is the pinnacle. Well done Jude you deserve it.
*Judas
👏👏
He's a specimen
My housemate at uni went to secondary school with Jude. It’s crazy to think how someone from such humble beginnings can end up at a club like Real Madrid, a sign of what the right mindset and dedication to your craft can do for you! Never give up! Congratulations Jude 🔥
Big up to Jude, hope he succeeds at Real. #5 jersey ...ngl, wasn't expecting that.
Great to see top English talent in Madrid, makes it more interesting to watch for me, when Bale went to there it was also great to watch
Proud of you, Jude! Even if you score against Dortmund! We will always have a place for you in our hearts!
I really hope he does well.
Why am I emotional
Lots of pressure for a 19 year old... let's hope he delivers
look how proud his dad damnit
Man its so nice to see his parents smile
❤He must get blessings from Zidane for dawning that #5
What a player Real have on their hands now. If they build a team around him, I can see Real dominating for the next 10 years.
Wait, he's 19?!?! WTF?!! He's already had his number retired by one club, and played 3x full seasons at the second biggest club in Germany, played at Euro 2020 and the last World Cup. But he's still a teenager...
I'm so happy for Jude but the camera guy crawling at 0:07 had me😂😅😅
So far most of those mega transfer projects end up with mega disappointment for Real Madrid in current years. Better look for quality ST, should bring Lewandowski last season.
balon dor incoming
Saka and bellingham are the most gifted english players ever
Mark this.... He's gonna do a HAZARD 😂
Evra once said" there's more pressure playing for psg or man utd.." he was so wrong. The most pressure comes from playing for Real Madrid. If Bellingham can make it here he will be a superstar. He is still young tho and can learn from Modric and Kroos.
He opted for no.5 because of his idol Zidane. Hope he follows him in every aspect except head butting people when triggered.
wow the nr 5 of Zidane is like Nr 14 of Cruijff at Ajax.. magic.
Jude should have gone to Man City to link up with Pep and Haaland. More money, better team, better coach. Real Madrid got lucky.
The lines on perez face so cringe
Have fun getting racial slurs thrown at you bud LMFAO who wants to play anymore in ITa and Spain joke leauges
This old man will get whoever he wants.. his name was mention even last year before all the rumours..
like all sports you are only as good as your last game. don`t forget that.
Real really do business on a different level at times. If they want you and the club is willing to sell, they pay whatever is required and wrap the deal up quickly
Biggest mistake of his career, Real Madrid will destroy his career and progression.
Genuinely never been this excited for a Real Madrid transfer since the signing of CR7...  Hope the lad absolutely bosses la liga and has an amazing career
His dream was to play for barca when he was growing up and he had written that I think in his school test as well and I am barca fan but when your club is not in a good enough position to do anything because of the past mistakes and mismanagement of the previous presidents and things of that nature and those things do come back to haunt you and till the point you don't solve those problems barca is going to be missing out on amazing opportunities like these and many more we just could not give a guarantee to leo that barca would be able to register him so this is a process to get fc Barcelona in order and we'll be back!! Very best of luck and congratulations to judge Bellingham for joining real Madrid see you in the el classico.
Look dad Bellingham 😂😁😁😁😁
Bellingham here to succeed Zidane’s place! The iconic no.5 Madrid jersey!
congrats jude shame he'll waste his talent playing in a poor league like la liga
So happy for Jude our boy from Birmingham City already at 19 reaching such great heights 🎉 KRO!
Zidane 5 = no pressure then!  Super young guy, I'm proud that he's British and proud that this club wanted him so badly. They are very fortunate to get him, to have his footballing prowess, his youth and his personality playing for them. Great things ahead for this lad for many years, congratulations Jude and family.
I don’t think anyone knows how painful watching this was as a Liverpool supporter 😂
Ballon Dor inbound
The new zidane
All for the money, proper sell out.
i have Trent Alexander-Arnold, so why do i need Bellingham?😅
Bring Mbappe to RealMadrid
Goat
Living the dream. Something tells me this young lad will do very well. He has a mentality beyond his years in addition to his obvious skill sets as a midfielder.  Wonder if Jobe is half as good?
No number 22?
I could hear the producers in the presenter ear during that awkward silence: “It’s not a Centre Backs number it’s Zidane’s and Jobe plays for Sunderland now mention that.”
He’s overrated player and will be a flop
Wow if his brother had his chin hair you would say there were identical
with Jude and TAA we have two of the most naturally gifted footballers in Europe... I really hope southgate gets his thinking cap on and builds the national team around them
What a moment for him… his age 🤯
Great stuff, I bet you he speakers Spanish in a couple of years maybe less.
Shame he didn’t get to keep his 22 but to take zidane’s old shirt shows what they think of him 🔥
greatest english player of his generation.
Good luck buddy, I hope you enjoy your stay in lovely sunny Spain and plays as good as you are in the best club in the world. Bienvenido Jude!
Zidane number 5
Wait till he gets racially abused. 🤐
Jude is an absolutely amazing player already, now he’s going to learn more from the likes of Kroos and modric
The fact that he is wearing Zidane number 5 shirt, it shows how much real madrid values him.. he will be a legend
Judeeeeeeeee 😍
The number 5 as well sure zidane wore that too congrats 🎉
why Jobe look so sour 😂 is he also want to play for RM 🤍💜
Most expensive youngest English player ever to sit on the bench in football history 😆
Nr 5 he got some big shoes to fill
you know you are a sensation when a team like Real Madrid take interest in you, though they expect you to be in your excellent form, not like Hazard, who gained weight as soon as he got to Real.
Number 5 big shoes to fill. Zidane 2.0🔥🔥
Same number as Zidane
My club🍸👯🎶... Real Madrid
Why did that guy hold the shirt so retarded. ruined the photos I'm sure
Where all these Liverpool fans now after months of begging for him to join Liverpool 🤣🤣🤣
Irl alex hunter
I know a lot of English players get over hyped but Jude is the real deal. Class act who will improve beyond belief at Madrid.
Welcome 🤍
Birmingham to Real Madrid all in 3 years, what a player. I’m sure he’ll tear it up in Spain
Jude has ruined his career by joining the most corrupt and shittiest Football Club ever
I wonder if when he was playing FIFA 17 to 19 as a high school student that he would basically become Alex Hunter
Upload his press conference‼️‼️
He's brilliant, all business.
As Africa we are Proud of you!
Welcome
His dad was so proud
🤑🤑💰💸💰💸💰💸🤑
Jude = Zidane + Modric
he is NOT worth 115 million FML wtf is this he isn't even that good 1 good looking season and then 115 million 😂😂😂😂 it's only down from here
He prolly didn’t think in his wildest dreams he’d be there at 20. Good luck to him.
Madrid not messing about this summer. Had to keep him out of City's hands. He's going to be massive for Madrid over the next few years!
Great move to a massive club.  Helps the England national team 🤞 Would be good for Kane to join him.
Wow, sitting few seats away from Raul 😎
Jude is so mature for someone who's only 19 years old. No doubt he'll be a success at Real Madrid and playing alongside players like Modric and Kroos will definitely help him aswell.
you are so nuts, i swear ! Real Madrid in playing in a league that is so weak, they are not even going hard to win, obviously they go in the UCL and have energy and power...the rest of the teams are dead !
The most talented player he is already so good and matured at the age of 19 got a great future Ahead of him
Gutted he didn't come to Liverpool but wish the lad all the best. You just know he's gonna tear it up for Real Madrid!
zidane’s number 5 🔥
Baller wish him all the best and he’s still 19😮
Moving to Dortmund was the best thing he's ever done imagine if he didn't leave Birmingham I doubt he wouldn't of played at the world cup or appear for Madrid
FSG out!
WELCOME TO REAL MADRID JUDE BELLIGHAM
Overhyped man he plays for bloody England
I'm so happy for him good to see him were he can get all he want in his career
❤ best thing for the national team having our star players playing for the worlds best teams
Yess Jude!
He’s gonna flop 😭😭
