What are Olivia O'Brien's biggest hits?  I like that song from 7 years ago, the one with 732 million plays or something crazy like that, looking for some other good songs to put on my playlist.
Cute
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
still her biggest bop
Mmm yeah I like when you call me that say it again
Gets you off when they send the right words to say huh gushers
You wanna tell me what to do now? All ears SCREAM at me OLIVIA
This song should've be a big hit, is so good (just like the other songs from her), but is so underrated..
literally my fave era
Love you! Thx for getting me through the absolute worst time of my life! ❤
I shouldn't love this song as much as I do.
Olivia where do you live ?
Olivia, you have assume voice ❤ and please keep work. love you, from Russia. Annnd sorry for my English 😄
this stars just like nonsense from sabrina
She ate this upppp
growwing  onn  mee
I'm a O'Brien Irish in me hi for name :)
How have I never watched this clip before?! So fckn good. The references are unreal. I was born in 94’ so loving this hahaha. Love you x 1000000
❤️❤️
Olivia is amazing
Oh my god, that intro made my LIFE
BN1'][I][
shes so sparkling in this... beautiful voice! i love the video so much!
This giving me akon vibes 🔥🔥🔥🔥💗💗💗💗💜💜💜 love it
I'm just now discovering more of your music and I love it because I feel like can relate to your lyrics
I love how this song sounds like it’s supposed to be the argument back to Akon’s song.It is so good 😊
I love you sooo much yes queen so much yes
most banger intro i've ever seen
😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️💖💘☺️💟😍
If everyone made music, do y'all know how beautiful and awesome and lit and peaceful this world would be?? 😍😍💞🌍💙🌎🖤🌏💝🙏
Damn if not every word she said in the beginning was not 100% true. How is it though that you hear about how bad men are treated and how shady women are and disloyal more than you hear about the skanky shady men that's out there. I used to hear it all the time when I was in the army about how too many women back home would write dear John letters and cheat on their spouse that was overseas but what no one talked about was how many of those men overseas was cheating on their wives back home. Before anybody says anything stupid I was a soldier myself and so was my husband and he's the one that cheated while he was overseas while I was loyal back home. Yet I stayed with his dumbass for some reason
She looks like my Baby Momma, not joking. It's Vice Versa though love with all the Bullshit women pull with men these days. This song has a great beat and hook, I don't care who wrote it, plus she's easy on the eyes. <3
Sampled Akon Right Now (Na Na Na)
olivia obrien teaching people to be insecure
He says that cuz its true... it happens cuz ur afraid it will happen or cuz ur afraid it will happen.
I see u
Who is still listening to Now by O'Brien in 2021 instead of Rodrigo's song 😂
I miss the her haunting Celtic voice on I Hate You, I Love You...
It’s the fact that i had to watch the beginning of this vid to realize he really wasn’t worth it
the intro lmfaoo
Wow
*🚊I am new to this singer, Seems like the songwriter is healing everyone around with this, including self. I too write to completely transition the way we thought about that thing ever again'*
Thank you for existing!
lol luka sabbat sneakin in there, suprised no comments about him....?
I’ve been listening to this song for the past three weeks. Make your assumptions over my situation in the comments below 😇
The fact that she's fucking him right now...
is it just me or she looked like bakugo in that scene
3:31 thats not how you use that, sweetheart
...I think he dodged a bullet
Lizzie McGuire illustrations
GOD I FUCKING LOVE YOU
Omg the gwen stefani look
Absolutely adore you
#xotuesday @xotuesday
so no one's gonna mention the mean girls reference ok that's how it is
Haley i love you
Her music videos and songs are so underrated she should be big big
Amooo 😍❤
felt like I was in some cool futuristic time portal
❤ the whole vibe
copium
That effing juicy couture that everyone was so obsessed about in the 00s 😂😂😂
Still listening after episodes season 1 came out honestly one of my fav songs of Olivias!
Oh boy, yet another song about how bad men are, and how women are all victims. Keep right on cultivating hate between men and women...I'm sure it will workout great for the future of society.
I'm just baffled to be honest. Not that I really care, but why doesn't she has more views?
i really like how she goes from all dolled up to that 90's rock look, nice track, in the deep house genre, i have noticed every few years all the popular songs get re-interpolated (if that's a word)  nice track
Ridiculous if you spell it out you care and love them and you bring flowers and do everything you can to make them see your twitterpated they will push you out and go after some dick head who beats them takes advantage of them . Here is a secret when a man throws himself at ya maybe he means it . or maybe you like assholes who treat ya like shit and hurt ya fuck it
in love damn
this is the best intro I could ever imagine
Reference Xtina and Gwen Stefani fucking awesome 😍 i'm your new fan 👏😃
I love this song! That's my childhood right here
This song is amazing 🤩
Perfect! I love ur work Olivia ❤️
Amazing
The grey zip up hoodie and the umbrella… it clicked on the second watch of the video lol  Edit: 3:24 is maybe Mean Girls?
💜🎶💜
The best part is “you probably think I never find out who you f***ing with but I know who you f***ing rn, yeah I know everything!” ✨👀💗👏🏽
You are iconic and slayed all of the looks 😍💓
Akon Vibes
I think she watchs anmie that look liked bakugou
8 MONTHS ALREADY???
i needed this song 3 years ago, it's just perfect!
An unknown girl who sings like Olivia: @
Truth!!!!
I hate being jealous but she's so damn pretty 😭
Ok, I'm old, and found her through the colab w/Oli, and generally not a fan of pop. But I'm loving her expressiveness! That sweet-as-pie smile followed by that fuck-you snarl (Billy Idol would be impressed) is amazing!
WHY IS  SHE SO UNRATED
This is giving me madison beer vibes and other vibes just a lil
I went 8 month too long with out this song in my life 😂
She definetly had fun while making this bop
Maybe we will be in love n/a n/a n/a ...
I don't think it's fair of anyone to assume people's intentions or feelings. You don't know everything xo
I love this song omfg the video is so cool
This song it's so cool 💖💞
Shes just probably bad at bjs
Ew  Edit: you’re “cute” but relax 😒😂
this song is a lil boring tho
Your voice wow
Can someone please make a proper instrumental of this please!
does anyone know how to do the hairstyle where she’s holding the iron?
Okay but like she looking like Princess Diana
1:41 Which Gwen Stefani's song is it?
Akon 😹
Akon has enter the chat
i love that all ur friends all in ur videos
He's also said that to every single girl that he came in.. - I MEAN that came before you  ICONIC
are we going yo ignore the fact that the song sounded like Akon - Right Now (Na Na Na)
Wowww those Gwen Stefani vibes❤️
You know I just realized she's pretty funny and bold, you would make a great actor. :)
2:13 my fav look out out all
whay does she look BOMB AF in every look 🥵
This may be stupid of me....but....is the cutting the hair and the umbrella thing supposed to be like a not to britney.....
i am 100% here for this
Just realized, the last guy I was dating was talking really ALL that shit.. "girl.. you're something special.. but I don't want a serious realtionship right now" .. .
Britney, Christina, P!nk, Avril, Gwen 💜💜💜 this is all so iconic
Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake all denim outfits on the Cartoon characters. Am I the only one old enough to catch that? 😕
MERECIA MAAAAAAIS
love her gwen stefani vibe 1:40
What a solid bop
Talks a or social justice proceeds to change her voice to sound like a different  race
Made me go listen to Akon
It hurts when you really understood the song 🥺
💩
Akon
same chorus as Akon lol
Wow every song this girl does she acts like she can't trust any dude and talks shit about all dudes, even tho 78% of girls have cheated by age 21 and 29% of guys have cheated by age 21.....so stop acting like you perfect talking about "I'll never be that woman in the kitchen" or Wtv you said...you just got your own problems don't act like it's other ppls problems
this deserves more hype. Should be viral!!
Loving this song, you done it well is right I see pink and Rihanna  x
Did the beginning make anyone else have a come to Jesus moment. No just me ok. Someone literally said those exact same things to me🥲🙃
dylan o'brien??? hahahah sorry
Mannn!!!! I love the new remixxxx
i hate this song but love josslyn your a really good singer just this song not for me
underrated
I'm in Love.
No I will not fall in love with no guy like fudge I wont even make love to the guy but he's more than welcome to have a good long sniff at my smelly toes on his face T.T
I love you Olivia.
Creativity is hitting different ❤️😈😍
That intro doe 😍😂
The I’m not ready for a relationship was literally my exact situation
I love Olivia
2:12 is my favorite part, what a queen
I love when artist sample famous songs frm the 2000s
Perfeição 💖
Wow like a Akon - Right Now Na Na
Why is it after a devastating break up all us ladies with long as* hair, we cut it off?? Lmfao 😂😂😂.. 18 year relationship gone, my hair was soo long..I went for the shortest haircut..
when he says “you’re so cool, you’re not like these other girls”  he really means that he still wants to fuck all of them too when he says “its different with you” he really means he also said that to every single girl he came in- i mean that CAME before you and when he says “i don’t wanna lead you on i’m just not ready for a relationship right now” he really means that he is gonna flirt with you anyway and keep you around till he finds someone new and when he says “i dont wanna hurt you” he only says that because he knows he is going to. your better than that baby,  hi im Olivia O’Brien,  and you need to move on
THIS SONG IS SO UNDERRATED. She rly deserves all the hype.
I'm baffled for those peoples didn't know Akon but i'm also thus for those Who didn't find this song still😐
Only time I’ve ever seen a sexy housewife outfit I liked 😍
Omg she's actually so precious?!? 😍
the makeup style is pretty Y2K and I like it a lot！
1:43 BAKUGO?!!?!?!?!
She's so smart. very good sample from nanana by Akon. I'm totally in love
so which one should i follow? this or "better than feeling lonely"?
Omg the references to Lizzie Mcguire, No Doubt, Disney, Christina Aguilera hair, more had me gagged! Love it!
the low rise jeans-  i could never
this is a really cool mv tho
People watching this like: - in bed - not in a full screen. - reading comments....
Used a black guy with dreads to show Justin and britney🤨
Right Now- Akon 👌
Not a fan of the reference to Britney's mental breakdown (with everything that's happened in her life being parodied and have that be referenced all the time can not be good for her) but it's a great song and the rest of the video is great! Just think that part was in poor taste. I'm sure Olivia and crew didn't mean it in a negative way.
i love this sm
Bruh. I JUST noticed Alex Cooper #daddygang
I need more ❤💞💔
Who plays the love interest in the video. He looks familiar
Natives cut hair to cut trauma. If you want to join a gathering in my area, let me know 🙂
U get a subscribe just for the start of the video
Pretty basic brought me here
The close up shot is damn acurate 😂😂
Damn did we date the same guy?😭
Oh, uau🙌🏻👏🏻
When i heard this song on tiktok i thought dixie damelio made this song😅
I am your big fan from Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
Intro: Disney Channel 0:57 Eminem "The Real Slim Shady" 1:32 Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake iconic denim look at AMAs 2001, in the style of Lizzie McGuire 1:40 Anouk "Nobody's Wife"  I am missing something so feel free to complete the references 'cause I love to remember all these bops from my childhood
Sounds like Akon Right now now
Who else can hear dababy rapping on this shit?
*Akon has entered the chat*
She looks like a Barbie with her hair and that green blue top I love the top i want it!
3:25 is that the juicy couture tracksuit?? If it is thats iconic.
Yaaas Olivia ♡♡
This is the best music video ever!
2:21 THE BRITNEY TATTOO AND THEN THE AFTERMATH OF HER CUTTING HER HAIR AND THE GREEN UMBRELLA OH MY GODDDDDDD
At 1:40 her hair style is giving me Katsuki Bakugo from my hero academia anime vibes
listen, I am sick of playing games so here goes. if youtube doesn't shut down by tomorrow I will kill all humans with coronavirus
niggas speakin bout akon, what about us?
i did not just noticed that it was alex kooper in the bed scene
I C O N I C .
Who's here after they talked about it on pretty basic
YOU ARE A GODDESS! 😭😭😭
Reminds me way too much of my Gemini ex 😂😭 RIP
gotta love akon for some reason he one of the best
This song is lit! 😍
She had just too much surgery and hyaluronic acid injections...
sounds so much like Akon's Right Now (Na Na Na) song with the intro of her song. Wow another artist that uses another artist's beat or lyrics. Be original or create your own. No hate or anything just hate nowadays that people do that. See Ava Max is another example for her latest song as well. And also the song Misery Business originally sung by Paramore and now sung by Machine Gun Kelly which he did not mention in the album that it was a cover or anything of that sort.
I would love then instrumental to complicated
who's here after blueberry eyes remix
i'm overwhelmed!!!! snapped!!!!!
This song is so underrated
Gwen Stephanie Vibes
Irrelevant comment but Dylan O’Brien
This needs way more views
I wish you could challenge yourself as a singer.  Let hear your  voice without the fluff. Cause your Are an absolutely beautiful women. Your one of those women who will get better looking as they get older. I know your have to make bubble music to the masses , but let hear it.
🔥🔥
why am I just now finding her music??? I don't know if I'm more in love with the song or her??
Your too pretty. You shouldnt of got plastic surgery done.
1:40 make me sing 'Right Now-Akon' hahahhaahahah but i love this song
Love you.
❤
MY BOO
Did not know about you right now but is beautiful now how could ever forget even you
2:26 LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE
I don’t like your videos👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
I don’t like your video
I love ❤💢❤
I'm so happy. When I heard this song... 😹😍🥺💕
But like her music is so accurate to my life
Akon 🙌🏻
I can just tell Olivia is gonna be my new favorite up and coming artist.  Cause this be my jam!
Aaaah amooo
I LOVE YOU
Who else thinks that she should do a collab with Sasha Sloan?
S O U N D E R A T E D
FUCKING DEAD😂😂😂😂
Just found this girl & im obsessed with her
🔥🔥🔥
YO THAT WAS MY DOLLAR WTF
Speechless I'm sure akon would have loved it too....
This gave me Anne Marie's 2002 vibes. I get so excited when someone does a 00s inspired music video.
Ok this is ICONICCCCC
Love that you just full homaged the 2000s
I liked this guy and he told me that he’s not looking for a relationship for a long time........ he was on Tinder less than six months later....

oh i love this one
Are you calling Akon to come?
ok but why isn’t it promoted
ate a capa do album foi copiada de akon, ue
Love the gwen throwback. Love all her 90s throw back styles and video aesthetics
vim pela Hi Nalim, adorei a música
adding the akon iconic style just ruins this song, like no you can't just put akon's song, it's weird and makes me forget about this song and think about akon
Wait, wtf, this is Akon's song!
Same with us gay guys, hahahahaha I'm in love with this song
I used to sing the og song as a kid and make love right na na na never clicked in my head O.o
Right na na na lmao
2020 is the return of the 2000's and i love it
I LOVE THIS BITCH  CAN WE BE BEST FRIENDS ?
Ok but maybe not reference Britney’s breakdown????
Very good❤🇧🇷
I addict to this song!!!
Tiktokers , did y’all know AKON ?
Dasgasdom3 <3
wow i love this ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
🤩🥰🥰👏👏👏👏👏👍🇸🇦
It's very sexy on how she made breakfast. Btw she can make my breakfast EVERY MORNING. It's ALL about LOVE ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
srsly, I've been listening to her music ever since and I can say that her songs are all too good. She deserved more recognition
Succha bop❤💘😭
I listen to this around 3x a day (YT playlist) love the nostalgia vibes💕🥵
shes so prettyy
Okay so I know we all get the disney, the pink, the lizzie McGuire, the Paris Hilton, but am I the only one also getting Rihanna, Nicki Manaj, JoJo? Just me. Ight
I love this girl wanna marry even if she die will marry ur coffin 😭😭😭😭
Olivia O’Brien is so underrated. I love her! She is talented AF! And amazing!
Dope video bringin back the 90's💕💕💕
queen
Masterpiece.
So no one is going to comment about those Animal Crossing sounds she added in the song?
The cartoons kinda remind me of Lizzie McGuire! Well everything reminds me of it!!! It official I love this!!!
Am I the only man that's listening to this?
This video is EVERYTHING
sounds a bit like Akon - right now
Love the hairstyle loves ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🎶
olivia is lil Iggy
Sydney Carlson <3
I C O N I C
loved it..
the cartoon gave me straight up Lizzie McGuire vibes, love it!!
this mv is so underrated why does it only have a million
No I don’t think you understand ... I’m ob-sessed
Esse clip! Esse song! Essa mulher 💥💥💥💥💥❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹💕💕💕💕💕⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡💥💥💥💥💥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
ngl, i have never experienced something like this, but that is just because i am not the kind of girl guys go after. i am a 5'9 goddess, built like a fridge, and guys do not like that. They like short cute curvy girls they can play fight with.
You're the only one getting me through this breakup lol :')
It's sampled from Akon - Right now (na na na) from 2008!! And that song is also about break up 😂😂
okay but i never noticed her hair changed color when she went through the window-
gwen stefani vibes
Akon is back hahahahaha
AKON?
2000s folks stans 💕
so fake I have to vommit! And it's been oh sooo long
Love u Olivia I got my heart broken the other night at work he found out I liked him and rejected me now I’m moving on
「女の子って楽しいよね」からきたー！！
I love the pacman sound.
Does she have a video on how she does that amazing makeup 👀  Like I can’t even hold an eyeliner pen but I can dream to play with makeup and if I do I want it to look like this
the intro made me happy
As good as Dua ...should blow up IMHO
This is NOT Olivia's best.  I know alot of people like this song. But I think songs like "Empty" and "Love myself" hold deeper meaning and hit at the emotional strings more.
I LOVE YOU, YOUR FASHION  AND GORGEOUS
LOVE LOVE LOVE THE VIDEO STUNNING… the song tho… not my taste
Also...Luka!!!!
very gwen stefani
STILL ICONIC STILL UNDERRATED
A carnal man cannot compete against the spirit of a woman
Okay this is another level wow
She's way too underated
she’s terribly underrated ):
Akon would be so pissed right naa naaa naaaw  🙂🙂
Oliviaaaaaa❤️ Just what I wanted to hear now. I feel so much better. Thank you so fucking much!❤️❤️ Keep coming!! ❤️✨
❤️
I LOVE IT!!!!

Hbjllhbi
I love Olivia - but unpopular opinion - she got in with the famous plastic celebs and became too fake to be relatable anymore. Her old songs were raw and real.
akon right now
Akon?
👑That's my girlll🎭💔 you the best!! I needed this...
The hair deserves a Grammy XD love the nostalgia!!!
This mv deserve a millions views...The heck I love this song so much...❤️
The beginning is so accurate
i love that lizzie mcguire like cartoon
i kind of know the background melody !
Omgggg lizzie
She is 20 years old
She looks like Amber Heard!
this is so iconic, love it
O refrão lembra muito uma música do Akon
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS VIDEO!
I really hope Akon is making something off this song cz I could hate other artist steals other’s melodies
I really hope Akon is making something off this song cz I could hate other steals other’s melodies
all these mvs with 90s-early 2000s style is giving me life
Lizzie McGuire vibes anyone?
she has voice, message, content, but still is underrated
I NEED THE HAIR TOTURIALLLL
Xtina ❤️
Is that Luca from Grown-ish ???
She is such a Boss and I love that she tells it like it is. Such an angery sweet voice. Love it..
Akon left the chat
omg i just noticed alex cooper in this video (1:35 and 3:16 i think )
Why are all of your songs a bop eye-
Does anyone know where she got the green top 😍 (at 2:14 )
"he really means that he's also said that to every single girl that he came in- i mean..." no ma'am you said what you said. don't sugarcoat shit.
tf she gotta looks like dua lipa and madison beer pftt for me wiwwiwiqwq
these looks are EVERYTHING
Corinna should have been in this lol
Iconic!
decent talent. dont lip sync. it doesnt work. good song. got them TLC vibes. get it gurl
this is so good.
So I just FINALLY got away the toxic narcissist I dated 3 times. And when he tried for a fourth, I HAD to use a line from this song. He literallly JUST broke up with his current victim and it wasn't even 24 hours later that he was trying to talk to me. So i met up with him cuz he wanted to "talk" and i used the line "what happened to your standards" Haha. He said to be honest, it was only cuz she gave me sex any time and any way I wanted it, thats it. I said well you need to make it work with her cuz i'm not interested lol
The fact that i have to come to youtube to listen to the intro or it just isn’t right ❤️😅
the flow and rhythm are kinda very familiar
Put jb on the remix
I love this song it reminds me of old school pop music lol when I say old school I mean early 2000s
She looks amazing
kkkkk e o barulhinho de "come-come" do yung lixo bicho, não consigo não ouvir aaaaaaa
I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE I LOVE I LOVE OLIVIA  I LIIIVE FOR U I LONG FOR U OLIVIAAAA

Why anybody would dislike this masterpiece is beyond me

Came here from Akon Right Now comment section
노래에 중독됬어... 자기전에도 생각난다구...

0:44
2.0 of the song form Akon right now
Luka??!!?!
UNDERRATED
Yes!!!!! Call all the f***boys out
So, IF YOU LIKED THIS SONG   Go listen to Akon's - Right Now (Na Na Na). Is the song that Olivia kinda sampled for the chorus of this song. That's why is so catchy.  Porpr to her for the video and for making this the female version of the original,.  Sadly for me it didn't hit tha bar after that badass intro I needed some badass drop or rap, like really really badass and in your face
pretty generic
Iconic
So this Is a copy of right now of Akon???
I just everybody  wants you nanana crossed my mind.
Y2K queen
*Dear stranger whoever reads this:* . . 👇 *God bless you and stay safe. You are a smart and awesome person.*

I tried to be strong just for the kids but I could not control the pains that tormented my heart, my heart was filled with sorrows and pains because I was really in love with my husband. Every day and night I think of him and always wish he could come back to me, I was really worried and I needed help, so I searched for help online and I came across a website that suggested that Dr vera segi can help get an ex back fast. So, I felt I should give him a try. I contacted him and she told me what to do and I did it then he did a Love spell for me. 11hours later, my husband really called me and told me that he missed me and the kids so much, So Amazing!! So that was how he came back that same day, with lots of love and joy, and he apologized for his mistake,and for the pain he caused me and the kids. Then from that day,our Marriage was now stronger than how it was before, Thank you  Dr vera segi for bringing back my husband and i recommend Dr vera segi for anyone who is having troubles in their marriage/ relationship.

The 90s vibes are EVERYTHING!!!!! Great job henny <3
LUKAAAAA
This gives me lonely - Akon vibes but thanks for the wake up call
Sorry akon did it first what can’t write your own music
This would be fire if you remixed it with Akon’s original and go back and forth 😍
90's...
a STAR
Good God, bless my throat after this cuz I am vibing hard!!!🥺
Yowwwwww was about time someone made this rebuttal songgg
This is hella smart tho
No one complained when Ariana Grande released 7 rings? after ''my favourite things''? So stop picking on Olivia wow.
The sample of Akon - Right Now (Na Na Na) Dammmmmmmmmmmmmmm
this is crazy. fantastic. amazing. astonishing. incredible. I will now play this on repeat until I can sing this song by heart.
Is no one going to talk about the hilarious reference to Britney’s mental breakdown? I’m not laughing
what an original....
I'm in love
Is this song possibly reminding anyone else of another song ? First time hearing it felt so familiar like it's an old song, and I was surprised to find out it was only released 10 days ago.
Ame los looks. La estética de los 2000's es tan icónica.
How she gonna be dressing like a punk emo and sing something that a 10 yr old tik tok girl would bop to
Akon na na na cover
ok but im obsessed with this whole video
Song is EXTRA you did it🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍
This song is EXTRA you did it girl🤩🤩🤩🤩
Now I wanna listen to Akon's song too lol love it
im glad shes not sad anymore lol but she used to make better songs
brings me back to akon days nanaannana
I dunno this girl before, this video comes into my timeline, I watch it, smiling bcause that Disney thing, and basically go "WOW" when I first heard she sings... Dang girl u got that jams
this is a fckin banger
love this oh my god
This is like my sixth time rewatching this and I only noticed quen Blackwell is here now.
Bem anos 90. Amei
I still can’t forgive her for talking shit about tod just can’t look past it, it was such a bad look
she DID that
Toxic
why does she do so many covers/ samples? like the complicated song
O M G this is such a good song
anybody else think she looks like peyton list
why wasnt i informed of this
Man, I wish she gave me that dollar she tore before she tore it lol
POP OFFFFFFFFF!
Ewww!!! 🤢
Amazing voice 😍
Thank you for sharing! OliviaHope everybody here becomes successful on YouTube
I needed this
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
If the transition at 1:41 didn’t take you back to 2000, are you even a 90s kid?
lol omggg i love this
That guy in the stripped shirt looks like the same guy from RIP
Please Colab with black bear again
#MRCastle💖💖 new cover https://youtu.be/EmUvjggdiQE
Every video of Olivia's I watch, I get gayer and gayer
How wacky would it be if she got akon to do a feature on a remix?
Have this song on repeat! Found out that the person I thought was my future life partner and the love of my life  was cheating on me the whole time we were together for the past year (been friends for the past 6 years before we even started our relationship) AND found out the girl got pregnant. Def know my value and worth and he missed out on a gem.
Why does this sound like akon's?
🖤🦋
i love the early 2000's Christina Aguilera throw back and the song is super catchy
She's underrated asf
YES! thank you! :D
That disney channel reference I love it!
This song is everything
Absolutely love this 😍😍
Just discovered this song and I'm already in love with it
cringe
The first time I heard her I thought she was Demi Lovato
the hair, the looks, akon, disney THIS IS SO 2000
Come On Over is such an iconic 2000 MV.
Clock the Akon chorus bitches hahaha LOVE
Ohhh that's the best song of the truth that I ever heard girl
This vid needs more views please ❤️♥️♥️♥️
yes babyyyyyy
These the vibes Maddison Beer was trying to harness in her baby video but she flopped so bad. This is a banger tho.
THIS IS SO 2000S I'M OBSSESED
Like it
And this is a music career?
So good 😍
I see the Christina Aguilera homage with the looks ❤️
Pleaseee make up till 1m views. I'm so obsessed 'bout this whole new hard work of her 💕✨ love you oliv 🤗
Akon song felling’s
She looks amazing 😍😍😍❤❤❤
this remind me of bebe rexha song "we can go all night oh nananana"
Am I the only one that noticed she dressed up like that singer from 10 things I hate about u
Nobody can get even slightly close to AkoN
Can we be friends
Love the iconic 2000 and disney reference 😆
Guys shes so good omg
issa bop and she is speaking facts. shoutout to my fellow sisters and brothers and in between on the gender spectrum who r attracted to guys and have to deal with many guy's bullshit! i got ur back and i love u all! we'll get through this together.
i swear olivia is so underrated!!!! i absolutely love this!! it brings back good times
WTF, Devon is in the video, I love her.
Where's that sound effect from?
this makes it sound so fkin EASY
Alot of songs coming out now sound 2000s but to see one look 2000s that's insane. This Christina, pink, lizzy McGuire, mean girls looking video is it! Being 27 this vibes with me...hopefully men/boy singers jump on this...throw back to n'sync!
NOT THE DISNEY CHANNEL REFERENCE😆
First 35 seconds of this is basically just a rant of how this girl got fucked over by some dude lol
can't even find their own chorus now artists gotta take from the past no more creativity
She looks like Kennedy Walsh 😍😍
The Britney Umbrella reference tho
I love this video left
sounds like Akon's lyrics for the chorus. and the sound too
WHEN THE CARLSONS MAKE A DEBUT omfggg drooling
The music video is so cute
everything you said in the beginning 35 seconds can be said about girls as well. i didnt bother watching your full video cause it seems like it would suck
*adds to playlist*
oh no are the 2000’s coming back?
This sounds like an akon tune i forgot the name of - this bitch copied him!!!!!
seeing her jack up that bacon gave me so much anxiety.....   what is this world coming to???????
What is the original song? I mean the chorus right na-na-now?
Y2K icon
I’m obsessed with all the iconic looks from the 2000s
Early 2000s done right!
Girl, why are you so underrated,  like I love your music SO MUUUUUUCH
The chaotic energy in the video??? I honestly expect nothing less from Olivia
I love you
la chica tenia tantas ideas que no supo que hacer
Been listening to this on repeat!! 💕👏🏻
what a legend
Sooo stealing video ideas & cultural appropriations is all these artist know how to do these days. Originality never killed anyone.
Isnt this the exact melody of that akon song?
I want to see a madison beer X olivia collab! I just know it's gonna slap so hard
Umm out of all the iconic Britney Spears looks you had to choose her breakdown umbrella moment? That ain’t right...
PERIOOOOOOODDDDTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love the sample  "Akon-right now"
Love it
O_____o
She’s coming for our throats with these bops.... RUN!!!
Y2k vibes immaculate <3<3

So under rated 😭 xx
She reminds me so much of Kennedy Walsh lol
Lizzie McGuire vibes tho!

Cutting her own hair after a break up is the realest

I'm in love with u OLIVIA ❤✨
All of this makes me so happy and the inspiration makes me actually happy to be my age..this music video made me feel like I’m young at 32 😂 everything about this made me so happy! Love you Olivia and please keep bringing back the 90s early 00s vibes! You never fail to make amazing music and music videos!

Clover is that you ?? 😘
THIS NEEDS MORE PUBLICITY!!!!!!!!!!
I wonder if this about Todd, he seems like such a player    update: i just watched a video where she talks about him and it seems to me now that she tested him wrong lol
She looks like james charles
Olivia just need more credit this is a banger
i’m just tired of the lip thing so much stank ...enough
meh
♡♡♡
i love everything about this video and now i’m listening to the song on repeat
lukaaa
Sounds like toxic monogamy to me
We Stan a Qquueennn
I love how this came out right after my ex cheated on me thank you Olivia
I needed this. Like hella bad.
0:35 thats the proof that a girls never happy in any condition...
This video gave me life she nailed all the looks
i live for the pretty girls!!!
why isn’t this #1 on trending
Olivia and I both aren't just Sagittarius, but we were both born on Thanksgiving.
i’m sorry but what the actual fuck, do not use that look from Britney. she has so many other looks and yet you have to use one from the night she shaved her head, celebrate her success and amazing performances, don’t you think the poor girl has been through enough because of that night.
@Olivia O'brien awesome! Nothing to say more than that dude!
I can’t believe people didn’t KNOW this was done on purpose. I adore you in every way. Have been following you and your music for a while now. Never change, love!
I live for the intro, absolutely the truth
This deserves wayyyy more views.
I'm lOVING that punk Olivia outfit
I only ever listened to her one song she sung in called fade out and then I just listened to this one NOW pun intended and it’s hella good
Yes!! Love the 2000’s vibe
2:50  karen asks for manager
No one talking about how "I don't understand it, what happened to your standards?" "Thought you were a gentlemen, but you ain't got no manners" "Where's your self control? You're making it too easy to let you go" those are BARS!!!
I DIDNT KNOW DEVON WAS IN THIS WTFFF YESSS
What would be Akon thinking right now now now????
Now lyrics Available  https://youtu.be/1db04FqZYys
Christina Aguilera Vibez😍
this is iconic
DADDY GAAANGGGG YASSS
Every Olivia o'brien song is ICONIC, loving this soo much
I'm so sad that you are not my lil secret anymore😭💞
What’s your favorite look from the video???
Are you planning to release album or sticking with mixtapes?
You and Drew really need to collab asap!!
Olivia i can't belive this is the same person who wrote 'trust issues' you've grown and matured so much!💞 (i still listen to trust issues)

I’ve had a girl say to me most of the things Olivia was talking about at the beginning.....
she lowkey sounds like christina aguilera
will this be a thing? like... is this the beginning of a new era???? cause if so... bitch, i'm living for it  love u, xoxo
about the purple hair....... i really love the way u look now, but as that tiktok old trend says...... "thanks, can i have it back???"
not a question, just so you know...  listening to your songs, watching you grow as an artist and as a person, even from that distance, inspires me, to continue, it boosts my self confidence, thx for making the difference in my days. i love you, purple queen
My God, I love her❤️  She’s sooo underrated tho
when will you collab with other artists? btw, a song of yours with megan thee stallion... girl that would be my dream collab tbh
will dexter be a part of the next mv?

Hey Olivia! Heard you were doing a Q&A. What’s your opinion on the literal genocide happening in China right now?

It's Akon-Right now song copied like it haha but still love this.
She copied Akon wtf
THIS IS SO UNDERRATED I CANTTTTT
sound like the "right now" from Akon
Okay Akon
2:15 giving me Hannah Montana vibes. I FCKING LOVE THIS VIDEO THIS SONG EVERYTHING ABOUT IT !!!!
Olivia:”move on” Also olivia: “i know who u fucking i know everything heheheh”
QUEEN THIS IS FIRE ASF
This needs more views and likes wtf
this song came out at the perfect time for me oml
when she said you need to move on it felt like she was talking to my soul. lol
The fact that I’ve listened to this song the same day I broke up with him. Damn 🙌🏻 thank u Olivia✨🥺
i really feel the early 2000s vibes n I love it
I've been going through a tough time at home. I feel like this song has given me some motivation to just start doing something about it. Wish me luck.
This is good. New fav artist.
your music videos are everything
Idk why but 1st time listening it’s ight kinda gave me letter from Houston by rod wave kinda vibes
I can relate to this song so much!
this is everything I never knew I needed
Olivia is genius for using a previously popular song. If it ain't broke, copy it!
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔👌🏻🤔👌🏻🤔
👍🏻💖✨🎶
really loved the spiked fits and the outfits that went with it !
big Akon right now vibes
Nikita Dragun brought me here and thank God she did it, this song is EVRYTHING !!
more iconic than Akon
Akon sample and Animal Crossing falling in a pitfall seed sound hahah
I love your music so much !!
the early 2000s have entered the chat
Listen to Winona Oak,Lola Blanc
-__-
Britney Spears meltdown moment with the umbrella and her cutting her hair prior to that scene 🧐😅
try hard 🥺
coulda used that dollar bill tho
love this 🇧🇷
in love with this videooooo!! yes girl!
I wish I could like this a thousand times
I love the homage to Christina Aguilera and the simple life... and the song is a whole bop
I love the vibe her music all has. It's like this bad bitch vibe. It's helpful when I've spent the past 7 years dating and am 25 just trying to be a single bitch. LOL. Love you Olivia thank you for this shit. ♥
all the dislikes are straight males
Yes! to this
She deserves more attention
pls marry me
LOVE this! 💯👏😍
YAAAAASS GIRLLLL
Loved it and Luka!
There’s not a single olivia obrien song i don’t like
use me as I CANT STOP LISTENING TO NOW button 💖💖
Am I wrong or there are some visuals inspired by Hannah Montana (the heart-shaped "logo" as in the Disney Channel TV spots) and Lizzie McGuire ( the animated character) ?
She snapped af
this is literally my favorite song ever.
idk y but 3:36 cracks me up
This gave me so much life, loving everything about it
Christina Aguilera, Pink and Gwen Stefani vibes 👍👍👍👍
Wait I love how she sampled Akon yes
The Y2K vibes are immaculate just like the song! Thank you for another banger 🥺❤️
The two tone hair is so Christina 2002
motive like Akon. I'm not the only one who can hear that?
All the 90’s vibes 😍
Yesss with the throwback vibes 😍😍😍
Love how Olivia did Christina Aguilera's #Dirrty hair with black highlights, then her #ComeOnOverBaby -hair with red highlights! Also I see some influences, shapes and colors from Come On Over video in general! Nice homage, thank you!
This is what you call a creative artists who will bravely stand behind her brave creative skills!  When you have less than average talent, it’s natural to look for inspiration in other famous songs. When you have even less than average talent, you’ll skim the boundaries of copying the song and giving credit where it’s due to avoid prosecution.  When you have no talent you just copy and hope no one realises.  Olivia falls smack bang on the middle here but in reality she’s a lot further down. What you get when ‘hot’ girls are followed in a flock on Instagram and they actually think 90% of their followers are following them for their supposed talent lol.
Omg I can see come on over music video and looks
Omg why why i've been struggling with the break up and betrayal stuff and i was searched her up for another song of hers and found this "The you need to move on" really hit home! Tysm for this Olivia, Love Youuuuuu

Delia’s commercial af
Christina Aguilera, Gwen Stefani, Britney Spears!  You did THAT!
It would be so iconic if she did like a like a “ohh ohh” in each of her songs bc her initials are OO.
I've ever heard this but similar song of what?
shes so underrated oh my god
Is no one gonna talk about the fact that Sydney and Devon Carlson are the nurses
Never realised how much Olivia looks like Gwen Stefani until this video tho 😳
YAS, REFERENCES. I see you Lizzie McGuire!
A lotta people don't know where the chorus is originally from and it shows 👀
The "you're watching Disney Channel" parody really made me ugly laugh out loud 😂
The Xtina aesthetic 🔥🔥🔥
YESSSSSS
Akon vibes!!
I love 💘
FINALLY! I'm not finding out of about this song two years later!
I’M OBSESSED
That infomercial is simply priceless.  All that was missing was an 800 number and an URL to download a podcast.

Everything she writes I love
Is it a song about the same guy that she wrote the whole album about? I think it's about Grayson lol. He did her wrong.. reminds me of my own experience
When Luca walked out that’s when I knew this video was Going to be good
for everyone commenting about how it sounds like right now by akon... yes! on purpose! he is credited and so is every writer on the song. it’s called an interpolation and i did it on purpose, with legal permission, and have stated this many times. i even replicated his cover art to show that this is a flip of that song from my childhood. please do your research! <3
I not only fell in love with the song but the music video too. This whole 2000s era is so iconic.
SNATCH MY WIG QUEEN
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.
all i could hear was ICONIC
This remindes me of some song but i cant figure out what song it is

Laura lareeva 😳
Does anybody know the name of the girl on the left 03:45?
akon is this you? what happend
i love how fun the video is. most artists try to be sexy and sexual but in her video its so entertaining to watch
I really love the video but the part with the bacon a no for me 🤮
I love the chaotic energy
Akon- right now
I am sad that the gummy bear ear rings weren’t there 🥺
She looked soo adorable with the short hair and umbrella
Catchy tune but basically nicked the chorus off of Akon lol
Is it me or the chorus sounds like Akon-Right Now..?
Hi! I'm Zohaib and you need to move on
This girl never disappoints
so many little references. The Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake denim outfits...2000's were wild lol
Heard similar tune in other song... I can't remember which song
Ad for Tiktok right before it gets banned from the US :D
The noise at the start when you lose on the claw machine at the arcade
Akon - Right Now***
Her look at 0:55 reminds me of Misa in death note
Olivia - Now - WOW !!! Awesome !
Great song but this beat is from the song " Right now by Akon"
Iconic queen
the way she cooked bacon on an iron Paris Hilton is shaking
Yasssssssss
Why was this in my recommended not complaining tho
the Akon sample... anyone noticed it?
I love how she fried the bacon strips with iron like Paris Hilton
I LOVE HOW THIS SONG IS INSPIRED BY AKON AND ITS THE SAME ALBUM COVER

Why isn't she getting sued for the same track as Akon?
Saw this on tik tok and couldn’t wait to see this video

Why hasnt anybody mentioned the fact that its luka sabbat.... i fuckin love him
go off, sis 💁🏻‍♀️💜
love you but your songs sound cheap and unoriginal
So obessesd with her songs
It sounds like Justin Bieber's song...
all of olivia's songs are a bop honestly
when ariana said god is a woman olivia said ya its me
never thought i needed a video with olivia, luka, devon, sydney, drumaq and nicole until i saw this.
😍😍😍😍
I felt like I knew this song immediately...!!!! Brought me back to 8th grade listening to Akon.
OH. MY. GOSH. Olivia did it AGAIN!
Loved this and all the appearances from some of my faves (syd dev alex etc..)
girl the akon chorus, the 90s/2000's fits, the avril lavigne hair, the vocals, the message... she has it all
Happy to say that i know the entire song in one day.
Costume designer 💯
Yes Olivia your songs are getting better eveytime, that i can relate to. No disappointment or no filter.
Olivia is incredibly perfect ❤️
♥️♥️♥️
Not to sound like a stan but... Olivia is gorgeous and talented and pop music QUEEN 🙃
We love an iconic queen
When you can't think of a good hook so you just use someone elses smh
Just came here to comment that she literally stole the whole flow of another song, can’t remember that song but damn ITS THE SAME!!!

Akon - Right Now (Na Na Na)  ?

the black blonde wig gave me avril vibes ugh yess
Everyone look in this video servedddddddddddd
Really felt like she SPOKE to me
the production value is *chef’s kiss*
Love the Looks and aesthetics... But Like. Not sure how I feel about where TF she is going with her music...? This still does not seem like her. It's like I'm watching L.A. create another clone and it breaks my heart because her originality in her lyrics and style was what drove me to her </3  meh.
i am living for all the 2000s inspo
am i the only one who got so fcking excited when i saw Alex? DADDY GANG
the end gave me goosies !!!! love it
Wow I REALLY could’ve used this intro one year ago
I have never heard of Olivia O’Brien before now, but Lexie put me on and this shit SLAPS
Amo essa mulher
She deserves waaaaay more recognition
this was so entertaining to watch. THAT SERVE, OLIVIA, WOW!
I don't need anymore my 9-5 because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Where’s Akon
Akon throw back
i see some anouk - nobody's wife in here...so 90s!! luv you oli!!
Un rolon para tan pocas vistas
honestly this is the best music video of 2020
This video hace barbie looks,mean girls looks,linday lohand looks,christina aguilera looks,pink and britney,nothing more 2000 iconic like this video
Girl u right 😔
OMG lizzie mcguire girl 😭😂
I am getting Pink, Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears,  Rihanna,  Disney Channel, Lizzy Mcguire, and Hannah Montana vibes!!! Yes Olivia 👏🏼🙌🏻
Big Gwen Stefani energy 😍
Serving us Avril, Xtina, Britney looks 🙏😍
Literally akons beat ...... “right now”
this was amazing
WHY DOES THIS SLAP SO MUCH
And Alex????????
How is this song supposed to help anyone move on? Remincising on how you COULD'VE had love? To a guy who clearly doesn't care or want love? I just want a break up song that doesn't involve the other person wanting you back, constantly calling you or pointing out that they lost "a great thing". Because 9/10 times, that's not the case.
Kinda sounds like akon.. hmm
Ok, so it's Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Lizzie McGuire, Gwen Stefani and what else????
cmon 2000s references!! purrrr
The disney style love heart killed me. Loved the all the 90/2000s references! Iconic queeeeen
This is everything.
gonna be playing this song on REPEAT for the next 3 months because it’s that good 💜
y’all saying she “stole” it from Akon. Like umm...  yeah you dumb if you ain’t notice. But I mean I’m pretty certain she got approval from him & his management team. Like have a seat you ain’t know the facts
Akon
AKON
I love this so much. This is the energy I need right now ❤️
AKON STOLE
Boo, you suck.
Akon vibes. I swear she's so underrated broo omg <33
okay akon
Thank you for giving me a reason to live again and another fuckboy bop repeat x a zillion ilysmmmmmm
Yes queen
fuck that went hard
So nobody is going to hype the Lizzie Mcguire aesthetic?
I LOVE ALL YOUR SONGSSSSS
I don't owe anyone anymore because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Okay but whooo is this song about?? 👀
The song is a ripoff! Hey there bots!👋
Right now (na na na) by akon😑😑
WED BE MAKIN LOVEEEE RIIIGHT NOOOW NOWWW NOEEEEEEWWWWW
I no longer need my 9-5 thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
I love you!
THE INTRO TO THIS MV WAS TOO LOUD. WOW

OOOOOMG THE BRITTANY SPEARS UMBRELLA BREAK DOWN
All these looks are a whole ass vibe
her cutting her hair was wayy too accurate for every heartbroken girl out there

it’s the way she’s so underrated..
I knew Luka from Grown-Ish was a playa. DESTROY ALL HIS DENIM WITH BLEACH OLIVIA !!!!!!
U ALWAYS HAVE THE DOPEST MUSIC VIDEOS ILY
Does anyone here think this is almost  the same as “akon -right now(na na na)” ???
2:07 IM OBSESSED WITH THIS LOOK
who else really needed this song right now
This tune is a big copy from Akon's song Right Now. C'mon make your own music stop taking others stuff and gain the credit.
GOD THAT WAS SO GOOD

I was today years old when I found out she sings I hate you, I love you with Gnash😂
Ilysm
I swear I never listen to anything besides Olivia cause why would I need to tbh
bruh i hope she knows how pretty she is
Not only is this song trash but is all her music about boys? Jees this girl needs a hobby. Their is more to live than boys wtf. She likes bad boys but cries when they treat her like shit, like is this girl okay in the head?
I feel like this is a Sims 2 music video come to life (in the best way possible)
SHE DOES NOT MISSSSS
This is my favorite music video and song of all time
so fucking awesome!!! completely in love with this song!! ❤️🇧🇷
YOU KILLED THIS GIRL
IM IN LOVE WITH THIS VIDEOOOOOO

THE AESTHETIC AND SONG AND OMGY THIS IS INCREDIBLE 💜💜💜💜
Olivia O'Brien, on the off chance you actually read this. I will always love you. You don't know who you're singing for, and you don't know who you are. I am the one who gave you your spark, you are one of my ordained stars. You are a star, and you are supposed to guide humanity. My love is pure, and true. It was this world that corrupted my love. How is anyone supposed to process the fact that they're a God? I am the God of Israel, and you are one of my angels.  In the Book of Revelation it says, in the end of Days God will pour out his spirit upon all flesh. I am the one who poured out my heart to you. In the Book of Job, it says No one says, where is God my maker, the one that gives songs in the night? God ordained all the Sun, the Moon, and the host of heaven. You are one of my angels Olivia, I meant it when I said "I love you, and will love you forever". I wasn't lying, my love is unconditional. I'm sorry it took me so long to remember who I am.
Woooow😍😭😭
fucking convinced olivia read my diary and wrote this bop
You’re a Queen ❤️❤️periodtt
