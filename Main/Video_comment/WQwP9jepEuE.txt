I love you 🖤 even if you don’t feel loved remember that you are and life always works out for the best
Not me crying with you
Who's here in 2025 so happy for her transition in life ❤
I wish I could give you a hug and a shoulder to cry on and wipe away your tears from your face as they trickle down your cheeks. 😢
I love this video and comment section so much. Its so good to not feel alone. I love all u guys.
I don’t know you personally, but I’m watching through your vlogs to catch up since having a baby but I love you so very much! I can’t wait to keep watching and see how you grow and find happiness in future videos. Hugs!
unsolicited comment that you'll probably never see Morgan, but I went through a period in my life that was similar to what you seem to be going through, though mine was brought on by trauma and I coped differently than you are, but I can still empathize. I think everyone has to find their path to personal and spiritual development, but... I always tell people that when you're in your twenties, you measure yourself by looking at others, and when you're in your thirties, you measure yourself by the merit of your own accomplishments. so I think growing up will help you, in and of itself, as it did for me. however, in addition to simply maturing, one of the absolute best choices I ever made was to de-vest myself from the opinions of other people and live for myself, all without losing my heart. I also deleted most of my social media, and don't bother with anything but youtube, which is generally less toxic. I really learned to put myself first. I honestly would not change a single thing about who I am as a person, and I am lucky enough to have the willpower and the means to change anything I don't like about my appearance, so what's not to love about myself? I think when you hit rock bottom you learn to fight for yourself, and to be your own best friend. at some point in my life, I got so low, that I somehow had this epiphany. I can't really explain it, but I just became completely sure of myself. it's almost like I hypnotized myself to survive. I honestly believe that I can do anything (within reason) that I put my mind to doing. just honest and true self confidence born from looking the worst possible version of myself dead in the eye, and instead of feeling disgusted, I felt moved to tears by how human I was. I really loved myself at that moment, and I felt beautiful in a strange way. I decided to completely abandoned faith in others, and in the world, which had always let me down, and put all my faith in myself and God/the universe. I think that this change really helped me overcome many of the challenges I was having in my life. although I still seek to improve myself everyday, and everyone makes mistakes, I don't question myself. I don't agonize about past choices, because I trust my self that existed in the past, I trust myself now, and I trust my future self as well. whatever I chose was right at that time, and in that moment. I really, truly believe that divesting yourself from the feelings, opinions and thoughts of others will save your happiness. I still feel incredible empathy for others, because I love all of the good qualities that make a being human, but I simply no longer allow myself to be emotionally or spiritially invested in the vast majority of other people, who are not on the same path of personal development. you can't allow shallow, hideous people to control you. just notice them, and quietly move on. I can't tell you how to achieve this type of self confidence and emotional discipline, but I can say that quiet meditation on who you are does help. the first step is truly accepting yourself, even the ugliest parts. you don't ever have to tell anyone, but you have to accept it and look that hideous thing that happened to you in the eye, and push it aside. you can see it, and acknowledge it, without letting it consume or define you. you're more than the sum of your parts, you know. I just think honest self -reflection, without self blame, as an impartial observer during quiet times, and learning to believe in yourself by challenging yourself and overcoming those challenges is a really great first step. set aside time for yourself to learn about you. think about things like, "why do I feel this way? why did I react that way? what does happiness mean to me? what exactly is upsetting me? why does that upset me? what do I want in my life? what do I believe in?" and so on. get rid of toxic social media, or don't pour over them - just the bare minimum engagement to do your job. focus on yourself, and direct your focus away from other people. that's honestly the best advice that I can give. hearing you cry breaks my heart, because I've been in a similar place, feeling like a stranger amongst a tight knit family every day, or worse, feeling like an old, wizened soul in a room full of shallow toddlers who control your life and happiness. you have to realize that you don't need anyone to understand you to be happy. you don't need anyone to acknowledge you. if you acknowledge yourself from the bottom of your heart, if you know yourself better than anyone else and you've honestly gotten to know the best and worst parts of yourself, you'll gain confidence, and that confidence will shine through in your daily life. people always remember me in a good way, everywhere I go these days, because I'm unusual, so I tend to stand out. my cousin told me that there's something different about me. that I'm intimidating, but empathetic. that I shine in a room full of people. I honestly think it's because I think deeply about myself, and life, and the universe, because I'm not focused on social media, other people, or anything surface level. I always say that most people never think about anything that isn't right in front of their nose. for people like us, who long to think deeply and develop spiritually, learning to think about the things that can't be seen or explained is a great path to happiness. there's a depth of character that a person can develop by looking at yourself honestly, and by looking at the world as an impartial observer, from 1000 feet above. I don't know if any of this advice ((?) if that's what this is, lol), will ever reach you, or if it does reach you, if it will help you, but either way, I really wish you the best. you're extremely beautiful, and you have the capacity emotionally and spiritually to go deeper than most people, which I believe is part of the reason that you feel so empty. focusing on the world, and the shallowest aspects of humanity will lead an old soul to despair, but developing the self and allowing space and time for higher thought will lead an old soul to happiness. good luck with everything Morgan.
morgan, i know you miss your old friends. i feel the same way. no friends. 0. i just moved across the country. if ur ever in new england LMK girl. i feel the same w the give the world 100%. you’re never alone!! love u

Love you Morgan. All the way from NEW ZEALAND. I know this vids old but it was hard to watch you cry but very reliable. Your an inspiration to me watching you doing things with your family is comforting on my shit days, so thank you for being you! You funny beautiful amazing human xo
I can never understand if she's fake crying or not😂
Jesus is the answer! I used to feel empty all the time and when I came to know and have a genuine relationship with our creator. My view of life has completely changed! Love you Morgan 🤍
this whole video i related so badly and the "god dammit" before crying really got to me. you`re not alone morgan, you will always have us, your friends and your family. we all love you and a lot of us feel the same way
This video hits so close to home! I'm sorry you deal with this but I'm so glad and thankful for you sharing that you are dealing with it cause it lets me know I'm not alone and I can get past it.
You're so pretty ~ I'm glad your videos showed up in my feed again. I hadn't seen you in a long time
I would've walked out of that class and went for a jog alone outside .. that class soubds obnoxious. I struggle with weeks just like this...sometimes i am up and thriving...then i fall behind...don't get things done.  I take time to rest.. then i get up and deal with it.
I needed this
I relate to this video way too much tf🥲
ive never related more to words youve said, what you said everything ijnthe red dress part… i wish we were friends!! i wish i could get up and have places to go and people to see and do thing everyday. and be better with the chornic emptyness.
this hit so hard. i have been feeling sooooo not myself and so empty. this helped me feel like i'm not so alone. i am so sorry you were going through this. thank you for sharing yourself with us.
You kind of look like tana mongeu
Fuck at 6.49 behind Morgan I see hands of someone😭😭😭 Morgan someone was leeching in the apartment
"Should I put tiki torches in my room to feel something?"  That one stung. That one hurt. 🤣
You're an awesome person Morgan. Don't forget that 🕶🍾
Thank you for showing what depression is. Showing that you can't just 'be happy' when people say 'no just smile, be happy' etc. You did everything right and you were still sad. That's how depression works and I'm proud of you for still working on yourself. Hopefully doing the right things every day will pay off and help you feel worthy and happy. THANK YOU for your transparency! You are not alone!!
This is SOOO necessary for people to see! Thank you Morgan!!!
I needed this video today <3  I have missed this video and I guess it was a reason for that, this video helped me to see that it's not just me. Think ill start my day tomorrow with work and after work, ill go through my stuff like this. I need to try to change
Hey girlie if u ever need someone to listen or talk to Ik exactly what its like to have bad anxiety, bad depression and also being that thick girl who has self image problems. I lov yah girl you are an awesome you tuber and dont let me forget your an awesome person as well. Youre a lot like my friends very fun and sassy and goofy 🙃 i wish i could meet you im all the way in Minnesota:(  just remember the people who love you are always there for u hun. You will get there. You go girl 🔥
6 months late but fuck this is where I am right now 😔
I'm always so shocked when I see a beautiful, young, amazing, smart women like you having a hard time. I always think how could someone like her be depressed or down? She makes good money on YouTube and is doing amazing on here. Has a beautiful place and a beautiful vehicle. She's going 2 school. She lives in L.A. is young as well has friends and an amazing family. I'm always like how????  I don't get it lol I'll probably never understand but damn your doing amazing at life girl trust me I would kill 2 be where you're. But it's this day and age..... everybody in their twenties think they gotta have life all figured out and you don't. Enjoy being young and free while you can cuz trust me life goes by way 2 fast and before you know it you could be actually in a bad spot  in life, older and no hope for anything better. So please girl your amazing your beautiful your smart your doing everything right in life. Your life is amazing.
we love you morgan and I'm so happy you moved to colorado because you seem so much happier, you're literally a role model to me and we all think that you're amazing :)
💙💙💙🌸
I love how being with your family now brings you so much happiness it makes me happpyy🥺💙💙💙
Send me some I love you much your fucking awesome
I’m 5 months late to this but sometimes life is tough and you just gotta give yourself a break and time to breathe
Love you so much Morgan 💖 You help me so much xoxo I love watching all your videos..and You have the most beautiful family who are so kind are caring 💖 Angel 💖
I love you… Thank you for this. I needed to feel like I wasn’t alone in these feelings. ❤️ Congratulations on your new house! I hope this is what the universe was pushing you to. 💋 ❤️
9:01❤️ I feel that
Morgan I feel the exact same thing! Message me girl i need more friends :) F26
Rn I’m going through depression where I don’t get up out of bed. I’ve been blowing everyone off , being mean with the my mom… I deleted my social media bc I feel like my existence doesn’t matter.  It’s like I get advice all the time and I know what I need to do to become better again…. But my mind won’t let me. I don’t have the energy .    I was with a guy for 3 yrs… I lost myself the day I met him. I tried so hard the whole relationship to be what he wanted… he told me I needed to lose weight when I first met him and 1 month later I was down to 110 at 5’6… then he started saying I needed to eat more and that I’m too skinny… then tells me I don’t have an ass. He follows every girl and compliments them but picks at my appearance every single day … he’s never given me a compliment. He cheated on me so many times and I blamed myself. He gaslighted me, put me last all the time. He tells me I’m crazy. This past year I’ve been crying every single day bc I’m down to my breaking point bc idk what I can do to make him love me. He keeps telling me he doesn’t love me, he’ll never have a future with me bc of the way I am. I still beg for him back and try even more to be the girl he wants but still isn’t enough. A few days ago he started talking to this girl and she posted on her Snapchat the messages between them and I told her he was my boyfriend. He ended it with me bc I told the other girl that. I cried bc I’m human and he told me I act like a kid bc I’m hurt. He uses me all the time, I can go on and on. I have become so dependent on him that only his validation will make me ok again, I decided for first time that there is something wrong with me bc why am I begging someone who doesn’t want me? I am now in process of fixing my life by cutting him out my life . It’s scary .
Thank you for being so real Morgan. There are so many out there who feel the same and it’s helpful to see we’re not alone. In my eyes you are a smart, kind, charming, hilarious, beautiful girl and you just exude light. Keep your head up. It may take some trial and error but you will figure out what makes you happy. Personally I think moving away from LA and being closer to your family is a great place to start. Good luck! ❤️
I just want to die, I wish every human would die too. Happy 2021
This vlog is 4 months old but I just wanted to say thank you for posting this. I recently moved out of my college town that I've been in for 3 years, (dropped outta college after the first year tho, go me!) and I moved to an area with a lot more diversity and I THOUGHT that's what I needed. But now that I've been here I've made the decision to move home so I can save money and go back to school and it's been hard comparing myself to other people in my life who are my age that have it all together. I quite literally have no idea what I'm doing with my life or where I want to live after I leave my parents house and it's just been hard. But to see you in the same situation helped me realize that everyone goes through these feelings and that I should just... trust the process and HOPE the universe has been guiding me in the right direction. Seeing you cry made me cry because I really felt for you. I hope you thrive in Colorado <3
Morgan🥺🥺I can relate sm to what you’re going through. You are SOOO strong!!!! It is hard to make friends but you’re such an upbeat amazing person. Shoot I’ll be your friend😂. Stay strong though girly you’re gonna get through it :)
Seeing your vlogs always cheers me up. It’s like catching up with a friend and realizing you’re both going through some shit and feeling a little less alone. Sorry if that sounds creepy! But you know what I mean. You give so much good to the world and your followers even if we never met in person.
Omg can we be friends? <3 You are such an awesome person. I feel this in my soul and heart SO much. The world really is so much better with you in it. You are so so SO loved; you have connected with more people than you will ever know <3
i love you morgan ! dont give up on yourself
Omggggg I’d soooo hangout with you Morgan rain or shine.
I relate to this so hard and am so proud of you for making the moves you needed to get better! This year has been a real mentalfuck, and it’s important to seek out the people and spaces that build you up.
Omg it makes me sad looking at you cry 😕
If you were gay I’d wife you up in a second honestly
Going through a break up while having no close friends or family. Just starting to get into therapy to deal with that and childhood trauma. Thia video genuinely brightened a really dark day. Thank you for being a kind soul and sharing your life
I have watched this video but im watching it again today because I have been struggling right now a lot lol. and I just have to say, morgan, you are so beautiful and have such a positive and radiant energy. i really really hope you know that
Morgan crying breaks my heart into pieces but i’m glad you did because it makes you even more likeable, relatable, and real. which i know a lot of people love and feel so much more supported to know others feel the same way they do.  (i know i feel like that) and it’s crazy how much i feel like you explained that you do as well
Hard video to make. Honestly hope you feel better one day. When you're decluttering your closet don't overthink it and just throw it all out. What you are going through had NOTHING to do with you that's just what the city does to you. That's why its great to preach the evil of that place. It looked like loneliness overthinking and ALOT of comparison that robbed you of the daily joy you had. That's no good for anybody. This was a matter of circumstance and not you. Believe it, seen it with alot of ppl here.
I actually cried so hard at the end of this listening to her talk about how empty she is. Fuck.
HELLO BEAUTIFUL MORGAN COLORADO GURL AND LOS ANGELES HOLLYWOOD
ur going through what im going through i never what to do anymore in life its so hard to keep living not suicidal just its hard being 27 and living with parents and been through so much recently its hard to find a good decent job never know what to do anymore
I CAN 100% RELATE
Girl we are literally the same. I'm shooked that we think the same. I thought I'm just weird but this video help me a lot.
ThAnk you for your vulnerability. I often go through the same thing.....fine for a few weeks then I’m a mess for a couple weeks. It’s comforting to know I’m not alone.
Dude I feel the same thing! I'm so glad you reveal your struggles because it shows your real and not fake! Keep strong we have those moments
Thank you for posting this. I went pants shopping today at a bunch of stores and in every mirror I looked in I saw a new flaw and a new reason why each pair of jeans didn't fit. I came home and I just sat feeling numb in my room and this video has helped me so much. I feel so strongly what your going through and thank you for making me feel not alone. This video made me reach out to a friend and were going out in an hour so I can have some support. You encouraged me to do this. So thank you
Hi Morgan thank you for posting this. Things have been rough for me too, I was diagnosed with stage 2 Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and have struggled with depression for years. This is nice to see someone be real on YouTube. Just a normal gurl like going through shit, just like me.
You're a mess! Get some help.
Girl!! I feel you!!! I’m the exact same way!
I am so proud of you for sharing this with everyone. Women need to know we all feel like this at times and it is ok and it does get better.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹🌹
You are beutiful inside and out. Just be who you are Morgan.
You are so funny 🤣
I love how true and open you are with everything Morgan, thank you so much ❤️❤️❤️
The fact that you get back up and keep decluttering after crying is so empowering
Love you giiiirrrrl. I've been through hard times like crying every night..or anytime of the day with because of pure disappointment with everything in my life. There were nights when I asked myself if I would still want to wake up the next day. Sometimes I think of how to end my life (never acted on it). Now I'm a bit fine.. not crying. Just getting by everyday.   You are strong. Keep it up. Your videos make me smile.
My aunt just died this May 12, 2021. It's just me and her at home. Now I am living alone. I can't sleep inside the house at night- I sleep outside my house. I'm scared and I miss my aunt. I don't get enough sleep Cz I'm just sleeping on a chair.
Thank you for this I needed it today. I am currently sitting in my car in 90 degree heat at my husband's best friend's wedding feeling this way just randomly bursting into tears it's refreshing to see I'm not alone. Thank you.
After a year and a half of daily meltdowns, im finally seeing a light in the tunnel 😁... I lost my cozy little home and a wonderful life living on the beach to Hurricane Michael. It was bad. VERY bad. Everywhere in the FL panhandle,  rent doubled, taking advantage of the ppl who lost everything & needed homes desperately. I salvaged a what I could from the rubble that was once my home and life, and found an affordable place to land IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, ALABAMA. 2 words: culture shock. No income, no friends or family, I knew no one. Today I smile. It takes a while but we are resilient creatures. Its okay to cry, to feel sad and miss the life we knew, we want to look back and its ok to do that, but keep moving forward, Miss Morgan. One day, u'll say, I had a good life then; but u'll also find peace with where the universe is taking you and you will be stronger for what u suffer for now. One day at a time; just keep moving forward. Take it from me, girl 😉👍 I never knew how strong I really was until I lost it all and now I say "a cat 5 hurricane couldn't take me down!💪 What's next? Bring it on, bitches! 🤨
it sounds like you may need a good roomate
So many lines you said are resonating with me because i literally had those thoughts just in different ways. INSANE. Found this video at the right time. Thanks for putting it online bc i couldn’t
I've never related so hard, just keep reaching out to friends and talking about how you feel. All you feel is absolutely valid and normal. We are going to get through it and learn some solid stuff along the way.  I'll be praying  Love, Erika
hearing you talk about these feelings makes me feel way less alone
I appreciate your vulnerability and authenticity. Thank you for portraying to the world that it is okay and normal to not be okay. Sending love, sistar <3
I have the same exact feelings that you described in this video and I am such an empath and such a simp but your videos help me so much. I know you don’t know me but I’m always here to chat girl
I appreciate you posting this! It takes a lot of courage to be in the public eye and share times like these. You definetly helped me know that I'm not alone in having these kinds of overwhelming emotions once in a while! And sometimes it lasts for days or weeks or even longer and you just don't know why! Thanks Morgan 💖
I love your videos! I've been going through the same thing but I watch your videos while I do school work. It will get better. For me it comes in waves so I question everything when I am down. But the trick is to let yourself rest and do small things that make you happy like getting a coffee or going for a walk with friends. The thing I've learned is you have to fill that empty feeling yourself because no one will ever be what you expect.
Ok, maybe I'm not alone :p
You are the most honest, kind, empathetic and accepting person ever. Just seeing someone go through the same thing as me makes me feel so much less alone. Thank you for sharing yourself with us always 💞
the way i cried along with you bc i am sort of going through a similar situation 😭 thank you for this Morgan <3
God it hurts so bad to see you cry! I obviously don’t know you but I felt your pain. As someone with bpd and struggle everyday with normal everyday life and waking up nobody knows how it feels unless they have been there. I had a job lots of friends and now I have none of that and just an empty shell. Your videos cheer me up and you have an awesome sense of humour your so strong I wish I was half the person you are. Much love to you xx
"DC is gone" *looks at my 4 pairs of dc skate shoes*
You’re so precious, Morgan. And look at what a difference a month makes! You’re now a homeowner!!!
Is there a video where Morgan talks about going back to school?
I had that and found out it was from drinking coffee! Try stopping coffee seriously I know it sounds silly but I swear it’s true ! Please try it!
I can relate so much.... except I’m in the phase on not going anywhere or getting ready... I just crawl up and dread existing. Thank you for speaking out on mental health, it’s such a touchy topic but we have to talk about it! I’m trying to figure it out l....
Lol or maybe your just human
❤️❤️❤️
this made me cry. I feel exactly the same. I just want to turn the lights off and sleep for a week. everything just feels like it's too much for me right now. seeing you buy the barn made me feel like when we feel like this it might be the universe pushing us in a different direction. Thanks for this.
I watched this when it came out and I was thinking about it again today. You have so many people that care about you and love you and enjoy checking in on your daily life. This made me so sad.
I relate so hard. I just moved to LA from MN running away from my family because as soon as they find out I don’t believe the same way, they will treat me like I’m dead. I moved in with my bf and it’s been a journey to say the least. Lately my BFF who helped me move to LA has stopped talking to me, straight up ghosting me, and I’m wondering what the hell I did wrong. Turns out she’s trying so hard to break into the film industry that she’s surrounded herself with friends who have connections. I have none so she’s cut me off. :/ It’s like- why? I thought she was better than this. We were friends for 11 years! Why did it have to change so suddenly? 😭    I know people drift apart but for this toxic reason? What in the hell? 😭 It feels like I have no one other than my bf to rely on and I hate that. My family is too toxic to go back to and I don’t want to rely on my bf to help me find more friends. :/    Sometimes I feel like giving up. All I wanted in life was love, friendship, and family. I could care less about materialism. But at the end of the day, I always feel lonely. As much as I can hype myself up, it’s not the same without a friend by your side.💔
why is this literally me. omg. i love you. so much.
Watching this vlog (late AF) but my 5 year old is sitting next me and she said mama who is that she looks like a princess 🥰. Love how real, relatable and vulnerable your vlogs are. Screaming positive energy at you from WA (that was a joke) but really positive thoughts your way, you got this girl.
you're not alone!
I feel the same as you. Last week I felt like this also. Just fucking depressed. I wish we could meet, we could be such good friends haha..
I’m glad you show this because I have/had a total different life then yours, not have family to support me just feeling lonely sad depressed & people always blame what I went through as a reason on how I feel towards everything it’s actually how you describe it but seeing your side makes me realize that there’s more to this issues you have your family that supports you & somehow still feel all this I can’t explain myself 😂 but I totally understand you you’re so strong ANYONE who goes through this is strong ❤️
Everything in this video - same
Recently discovered you.... And I just wanna give you a big hug! I am pretty sure you already know it but you are about to embark on a new journey with this home reno that will really empower you and help you grow in more ways than you ever could imagine. I'm excited to watch the transformation both in the house and yourself! And, while I know it's unlikely, if you ever want free/friendly input on stuff with the new house (from a former interior designer) feel free to message me! You've got this!
We really need to support each other on this time. We should start pen paling or something.
You have no idea how much this helped me!! I love you and will gladly be your friend!!! <3
I feel like you went to Cali to find yourself, and i think that you did find yourself! You may just be disappointed because of your expectations. As i watch your vids i can see your family is a security blanket but that you also have the deep independence of who you want to be. These things often don't mix well but I see that one way or another your soul will push you to what you need! And now look, you're buying a home to renovate, which is SOOOOOOOOO you!! You got this bestie love you
How do u not practice buddism?
Wow u def described my daily struggles as well
I would have told that lady to stuff it because that's so rude to be like that to someone
You are so beautiful inside and outside 😊💕
15:32 MORGAN you're a BEAUTY
I know how you feel I get that way some times you are awesome and beautiful thank you for sharing this I wish I could give you a hug right now
i feel this so much... continuing on so you don’t get stuck, but still also being stuck in your mind in a way. it’s so hard, but everyday you’re getting up, and you’re doing it and it makes you stronger 💪🏼💜
Morgan, you are an amazing person! AMAZING!
I died when you said okay geometry
I can tell you as someone who was in a rehab (in patient) facility for depression & anxiety you are very strong! Keep going, keep doing your things, move your body, go to therapy, do things that bring you joy. Surround yourself with people who lift you up.  One day, you‘ll have this kind of AHA moment when you wake up and say „damn I‘m having a really good day / week / months“ Life is in a constant flow, up and down. One of the things that makes us so depressed is wanting to be „happy“ and productive all the time. That is not realistic. Especially living in LA must be such a mindf*ck bc everyone is there to become „successful“. But if you‘re not happy within your soul, no amount of money / fame etc will help. I hope you‘re feeling better and sending you so much love!
Just thank you for this video Morgan <3 You are such a beautiful human being <3
You sure are productive for someone struggling. I’m nowhere near your level.
this is exactly where I am at man. it's fucking hard man
get off social media. live like the 90s. live REAL life..
Medicine stings in a healing wound
Morgan can we be friends in real life?
WHY IS THIS THE EXACT BREAKDOWN I HAD TODAY
It made me so sad to see you sad 😞 I’ve been watching your videos from the start and I always thought we were so similar and would be great friends. I know you weren’t feeling great but girl you looked amazing. Sending you all the good vibes 💕
A llot of the things you said really resonate with me. I've lost a bunch of friends that I considered like family in the past year and I've lost my dad and I'm essentially trying to build a future post-college in a place where everything has changed and I just feel like it's time for me to go and venture somewhere else but letting go of so many important things to you all at once is like a brick in the face. Been trying to stay collected for the passed 2 years and I'm only just seeing a bit of light through meditation and spirituality (astrology & witchcraft). It's rough and heartbreaking, but I think you got the right mindset by accepting that it is a transformative phase that needs to happen. It's part of the process and we will all be alright, but we need to pass through this phase first and it's ok to allow yourself to feel whatever you're feeling. Sending good vibes your way xx
I sat here and cried with you this whole video. I have felt the things you're feeling. And I know you're not asking for advice. But I would really suggest getting some blood work done if you haven't already! Check your thyroid and check your vitamin d levels! Those two things being out of whack can make you feel all of the things you've described!  I know this is a late comment too and I don't know if you're already feeling better or not. But I really hope you are. I identify with you a lot.
You suit all the glasses omg
I have no friends either and I feel like I try to hard for others. I’ll be your friend :)
Morgan, I actually just want to hangout with you, but you probably don’t need my energy. I just want to let you know that we cannot see the strength in ourselves but you are so resilient. Loneliness can make us depressed and feel like we aren’t happy, but your personality and smile is so genuine that I know your strengths will persevere. Hand in there... even though it is so hard. The more we talk about how we feel, the stronger we become.  Sometimes, we give too much of ourselves to others and need to realize that we can only give a part of ourselves when we’re hanging out with them. They can be good or bad but don’t be afraid of being yourself in front of others, your loved ones, us... I know you feel better now but maybe living in LA isn’t the right place for you. Best of luck to you love!
"I'm a back corner bitch" that shit hit so hard.
Morgan: how do you kindly say....very aggresive?  Mee: Well , THAT is kind as fuck.
I love you!! You’re so strong and beautiful I can’t wait to see the push through!
Aw Morgan you are so hard on yourself, you are gorgeous ,funny, smart. I have been where you are and still struggle. You are gonna have a great life.
Omg i am now forever callling my break downs break thrus. Also her makeup looks so good here
Hey love, you ever been tested by a professional that specializes in Adult ADD or ADHD? Just a thought, nobody come for me. Wishing you peace and prosperity. You got this.
No! Those DC shoes are the comfiest thing ever made. I’m going to go order a pair now!
I'm like two weeks late to this but I just wanna say I felt this video so hard. I went through like a six month period when I felt exactly like this video. Just gotta remember that everyone's out here just trying our best. Love you Morgan, thank you for this.
Thank you for being so transparent. I, We, are NOT alone.
I hope you’re able to find your purpose in life and realize that God has you here for a reason. Jesus loves you Morgan, praying for you💓
Omg I went thru my jean pile while depressed last month and it was the worst thing ever. I just donated all of them  and said I'll start over after quarantine.
I just love you so much! I cry with you, laugh with you, and feel so often as you do. Never forget how truly amazing and talented you are!! I dont have words to properly describe your bravery and selflessness, being as open and raw as you are. Just always know you are appreciated and so very loved by so many.
For me, when I started to become more and more aware of my mental health is when it got worse. Sometimes that introspection can really trigger horrible feelings. Once I went through that self-exploration, the novelty kind of wore off, and I was able to be more accepting and feel waaaay better.
I swear I love watching this ! It’s too funny! Since I go through it also. And I laugh in the end on how silly I was. Last week I was crying over dumbest shit.😅
A spiritually awakening is exactly what you are enduring.
Loving the red dress on you... without the jacket though.
I completely understand how you feel, what usually helps me is foraging and get fascinated with nature, I believe humans are not living the live they're supposed too, we need to connect with nature so we're not so depressed.
I am on the verge of a breakdown but instead of dealing with it I keep doing things. I don't have anyone to come to, so being busy is really the few coping mechanisms that I know. Watching your videos and I relate to so much, love your work.
Morgan just want to say I love watching your videos .You are naturally hilarious and and a genuinely decent person X
Most of the sunglasses she said no to looked rlly cute . But why do u have them if u don’t like them
Beautiful
did anyone else think every single pair of sunnies looked great on her?
At least u know what ur issues are and own them, that's half the battle! Sending good vibes! ❤
The whole video be like a roller coaster
I love your vibe and you're special. ❤️
Last time you were struggling during vlogmas guuurl
It is painful to finish the whole video. I feel overwhelmed watching Morgan going through all these emotions. This video just too heavy and too depressed to watch.
I'm in the "maybe I'm not alone" group💜
Honestly I hope you’re ok and I’m sorry you have to go through this but honestly I have never had someone describe the way I feel any better than you and actually it made be feel a lot better . Thank you xx
Girl!! The universe is screaming to you, LEAVE LA IT'S NOT FOR YOU! Youre a real girl living in a fake world... And unfortunately LA is filled with the fakest humans who will stand on anyone to get ahead.... Love and light to you girl, you got this!!! 💪💪💪
Sending love, Morgan. I relate so strongly to this, and it’s so scary when it doesn’t get better after a few days. I moved from LA to CO a few months ago and I’m really enjoying the different vibe here. Definitely feel like we would be friends. You’ve got this! :)
YOU ARE the MOST GOREGOUS person to EVER LIVE!!!!!!!!! LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!
morgan please make a vid w Sarah basks I feel like you guys would have so much fun and really connect <3 hope ur taking care of yourself
i truly believe the only reason morgan is still in LA is because of ryland.. whether people think he's mean to her or not.. he cares about her & she cares about him. morgan has had so much growth within the past few years. i think she's going to realize soon is she belongs in colorado. she was glowing & thriving & you could see how happy she was being with her parents & grandma! morgan girl you got this!
I moved to California from Australia to be with my husband and Its been rough to make new friends, being 30 years old during a pandemic. I miss my family and old friends back in Australia. Its not easy moving to another state away from everything you knew, how do you even make genuine friends anymore? You are an amazing person Morgan and just know you aren't alone. Just keep being you mate.
I love to watch Morgan because she's one of the most beautiful people I've ever seen.
You need a kid like it'll be hard at first but my boys are my everything! I'm never alone they are there always ready to do anything from sleeping to the park n the laundry or sit in the bathroom with me while I cry they are so funny!!
We are crazy together !
Are you still friends with Trinity?
I ... main dishepitpop is r u fishypoot
Girl ur not stupid. Ur a beautiful soul and brave for talking about ur mental health. Everything will be ok. Much love from TN
Gurl, I want to be your friend. Seeing you feel so alone really resonates with me.
I personally think Morgan should move back to Colorado or anywhere not LA. I feel like being in California takes such a toll on people 😕 (I live in CA and was from IL) so I think I can relate to what Morgan might feel when you go back and forth to two different atmospheres. CA is so chaotic and so fast paced and so overwhelming. While Midwest or like just anywhere thats not so populated and so chaotic is so calm and you can take your time and you arent pressured or overwhelmed with that 'image' you have to keep up.  Morgan seems so much more energetic and happy and carefree when she's around her family in Denver. Idk... as someone who's lived in California since I was in 6th grade (now 20) I fully know this is not the kind of state I want to live in. Planning on moving to WA because I felt so much more me there.
♥️🤍
Not trying to be the religious nut or anything (also not trying to assume your belief or anything) but for me personally I always feel that pit in my stomach that I’m just not living to the fullest. Honestly without my relationship with God I would fully crumble. I’m not saying that this is the only way, but a lot of times when I feel like everything is wrong I just sit alone in my room, lights off, and just talk to God in the silence. It’s so relieving and I feel like he is listening and just holding my hand through it all. If you don’t believe in any of that I totally understand, but I hope that if you are open to that then it might help ❤️
you are amazing morgan, i feel you!
Omg the soul cycle story we are all bottom feeders 🤪
At 6:30 was that your cats paw behind your head by the nightstand? LOL
Morgan, MOVE FROM LA, we can see it’s not good for you and you are not that kind of thing person, your too good and honest for LA
If you come back to Colorado I’ll be your friend lol I have no friends either
I didn't want to watch this video when it first came out cause I thought it would just make me more sad. But it did the opposite! It made me feel less alone in what I'm feeling. Thank you!
The Universe is trying to tell you something!   This 50 yr. old Orange County auntie loves ya! Zenhugz.
I felt this on such a fundamental level
And see when you go through this you don't think anyone really gets it but I get it. I have been going through this since 2/22 and im turning 40 Saturday and I don't really know if thats it but I had to take off work because I just can't right now. I went to the dr and its not helping and im trying so hard and I have been alone for 8 years and I just don't know what to say. But thank you for sharing with ne that im not alone.
I cried too because I feel this way. I love you Morgan
Morgan, I have been going through this since 2/22 idk why but I just can't get out of it. Idk what to do. But it helps to know I'm not alone 🖤🖤🖤
Girl listen to “just like you” by nf. It helped me a lot and I think it could help you too!! ❤️
lol can i have the ones T 13:09 PLLLLLLEEEEEAAASSSEEEE
That soul cycle instructor has TOXIC energy. Maybe SHE'S THE BOTTOMFEEDER for being condescending/judgemental turd.
I’m going through the same thing man ): thank you for being vulnerable for us. This helped me a lot today 🥺❤️
sweetheart!!!
Ok I’m sorry really off topic but  WHERE DID U GET UR CREWNECK
Crying with a pile of clothes behind u.. mood
Thank you for showing us the raw emotions! So relatable! I've been there before.. sorry if I'm beating a dead horse, but have you looked into counseling/therapy? CBT can help you understand your emotions and change your mindset when you feel stuck. Just thinking of you and want you to feel your best!💕
Morgan you are so strong and brave to share all of your struggles with your mental health and I think you are doing a brilliant thing by helping to make people feel less alone xxx
“We simply have no other option than to figure it out, so here I am figuring it out. I hope you’re figuring it out, too.”  As someone whose life has been completely flipped upside down in the last year, this is so real. Here’s to everyone struggling and figuring it out rn 💓
I loved your fashion show! I wanna see more of that!
I foresee Morgan getting into Yale, moving, and getting into great things! I love you Morgan! 🥰
Aw this made me cry😢 I'm sorry you're going through this it sucks. Thank you for being so honest and showing the not so "seen" side of mental health. I feel like I'm in a similar place to you and it helps me feel less alone watching a video that I can deeply relate to. Good luck on your journey x
We love you Morgan. Stay strong girl!❤💜❤💜❤💜
Are you still friends with Trinity?
You seem like such a genuine, caring person. Im happy to hear you are doing better compared to before. Hang in there. You are beautiful and deserve nothing but all the happiness :)
You need to move to Colorado!!! Your mental health needs it!
Why do you live alone if you don’t like living alone? Why not find roommates?
Morgan you are so strong. You are such a beautiful person, and you radiate so much positivity in this world, you're too good for LA
Okay but like....red is your color
Dear Morgan! You are the most relatable person on this platform. Thank you for helping me relate to you on a personal level. I too had that horrible day on sunday where after that i fell ill with the flu bc i just wasn’t taking care of myself bc of stress, struggling with my too low of a weight to fill out any jean and i just wanna say.. i know it might be hard for you but yt is a big enough platform that you don’t need ig. I deleted it last year march and it really helped with me not comparing myself to anyone but embrace myself as crazy as i am and people tend to vibrate more to me. I made so many new friends and acquaintances that when i have those good days and i find the right outfit i light up places and then universe is just like look at her go. I know you can find your happiness and it’s just around the corner. Just find a way to see yourself as all of our friends because i bet that every girl and boy relating to this.. we could have a smores camping night in cabins and have a lit sleepover and just be human for a moment. So if you’re reading this ever, know that you are loved, supported and cherished. Even when you feel like you’re not. And remember kids, you’re 20% more attractive than you think you are! ❤️
I LOVE how real you are ❤️ You are amazing, hope you feel better ❤️  My friends left me because I have big dreams and I moved 1 hour car ride away with my (first ever) boyfriend and all of them are single. I just felt like if they can't be happy for me and supportive, I'd rather have no friends. Yeah it's sooo hard making new friends especially in a new city where you don't know anyone but you should never have friends that are not supportice and happy for you. ❤️
I love you ❤️
What you're going through is very familiar to me as well and many people go through. This is a void in our lives only God alone can fill. I recommend you to read a book "The Purpose Driven Life" by Rick Warren. Blessings and be safe!
Thank you for making this video, it helps me so much because I am going through something very similar
Girl stop apologizing for being human!   This is the 1st video I've ever watched from you and I've subscribed Because you're so relatable! I really hope it gets better for you!
Nice video keep it up make more related videos
I love you so much Morgan. I wish I was a close friend aghhhhh you deserve to be happy! You have such a loving family, and friends you need look at that more. We ALL love you girly, why you think we always come back and to continue supporting you. ALSO YOU HOT AFFFF BBIITTTCCCCHHHHHHHH LOVE YAAAAAA SIS ❣️🥰
Morgan dear. You’re depressed. You need to find yourself a good doctor and the right meds. 🥺💕💜🧡
Ahhh you Said no to the sunglasses that really suited you 😶
Morgan you don’t have to give away stuff to gain happiness. I really Wanna give you a covid Safe hug Right now 🥺
Morgan you could actually step up your therapy game - go 2-3 times a week. As in depth therapy. Maybe moving in with someone else would be good for you too. 🙏 you got this!! And honestly even if you don’t - that’s ok. You don’t have to be fine. You can feel all the feels and still be a great person. You’re actually growing right now - your soul - your self awareness - you re all growing. This is your path to becoming you. The real you. And I’m grateful you’re being so open and vulnerable about it. 💜
I swear you are so freaking beautiful like I can g even and I feel every single word you said it gets very hard at times and it's true you never know what someone else is carrying but you also have to prioritize YOU it's hard but not impossible my lovely ❤️
I freakin love u
No actually you put those on and you get like 12 points hotter js
I absolutely love how vulnerable you get and you don't  show the "perfect life"  You are so real! I hate that you have to deal with mental health struggles but you are so inspiring and make me feel better when I'm going through similar issues
girl I relate to this so much. depression is so hard.
I have some advice that honestly has helped me learn to love myself.. when I never did before. Whenever you catch yourself making even the tiniest self deprecating comment, say out loud "No. I am not ___." Maybe replace it with something like "I'm just being silly. I'm having an off day. & It's okay." Even if you don't believe it at that moment, rewiring what you say out loud about yourself to be more positive (or even just less critical) truly helps, even if it takes a long time. It's OK. One step at a time. 💕 I'm here for you, I love all of your work. Thank you for being you.
Hello angel. 💕 I just want to say that I am going through the same painful transition, && I promise it gets better.. I am just holding out for a few more months, I know things will change.. I am proud of you, you are not alone. 🌹 Thank you for helping me feel less misunderstood, too. Much love. 💜
Maybe you should write a book!
I wanna be your friend!
Also Morgan. You're fucking normal okay. Idk if you know that but you're beyond normal. You're exquisite most humans are fucking unconscious (not self aware AT ALLL) dumb asses! You're self aware and smart and I just wish I could make you feel more confident in yourself cause you're a star
You're a beauty.. your sensitive soul radiates good vibes much farther than you think you could imagine! And this inspires me, how brave to just put your shit out there, I'm glad you have!
U should move from La....ur not that bishhhh anymores yano
I wish I could give u a hug!!!!! I love u!! Ur great and I wish I had a friend like u lol...not creepy at all! 🤪😝🤗🙌
I just want you to know I’ve felt exactly what your going through several times and I’m only 26. But good times are coming! Your energy is beautiful and will attract good people around you! 💖
Your a very sweet, kind hearted, humble person Morgan, It breaks my heart when I hear you trying ur very best to push urself to appreciate life everyday and find purpose within urself. All I can say is that what if, just my personal opinion, the emptiness u feel in ur heart and soul, or the missing piece within you is Jesus. I know other people will say other things, but just think about it, It’s not a coincidence that Every single person knows the name of Jesus weather they believe in him or not, I mean, even you say out of ur own mouth God this or God that, he’s there, patiently waiting for you to open ur heart to him 🤲 💟 I Just Pray you at least give him a chance and just see if anything happens or anything changes in ur life, you’ll be Amazed how much ur Eyes, Heart, and Soul will see and Truly feel 🤍✨I tell you, it’s just soo eye opening, Refreshing, and a Breaking Free inner feeling!!! 💫  it’s Truly Amazing, you got nothing to lose Morgan, but Everything to Gain 💝🌟 Praying for You and Everyone who comes across this comment. I Promise, I Normally don’t do this text message thing, but who knows, maybe God gave me the Courage to do it for a reason 🙏😉
I feel you dude. I've been stuck in a new state since the pandemic started and have no friends still. I'm super lonely. I'm going to dinner and the movies alone now. It shouldn't be this hard... But maybe just a trial I have to endure to become better. I know you'll prevail,  Morgan. You ARE a great person and the universe will always care for you. I send you love , distant friend. Thank you for posting ! Helps fill my void
I feel this on so many levels. Thank you for sharing. I totally understood everything you said. One thing you said about it it zips it doesn't mean it fits. Yes, I finally excepted that about me. You're beautiful inside and out. Sometimes we just have to talk it out and cry. You did it and you don't realize how you're helping others too with vlogs like these. Thanks 🖤
I can feel you... It's not easy to go through depression
its okay to be not okay when things are fine!! you don't need a bad situation to justify your feelings! it's them chemicals in your brain meat!! reach out!!
for all of you out there with ze mental illness and going to college, get in contact with your disability board and your professors. Even if you can't get a pass from your college, professors are pretty understanding if you just communicate what's up. sincerely, a depressed bitch in a top ten college
Love you in the red dress!!!!
Its called depression. You need to talk to your doctor honey you may need to get a prescription for medication that will help with that.  It could be a chemical imbalance.  I understand all to well. I have suffered from this for all to many years. I take a medicine and it had me balanced out now. Smile,  it will be all right!!!
Dude this shit never makes sense.. be as honest as you can with your dr. You are NOT stupid at all.. you are so emotionally intelligent and so empathetic and so fucking strong. Also that red dress looked BOMB on you👏🏻👏🏻 the color looks so good w your skin and eyes
I’m thinking about you girl. I hope you’re climbing out of this dark season. I totally get it. The cool thing is that’s you’re aware of this happening and making effort to not sink further into it and to better your life. Also that SoulCycle instructor sounds awful what the fuck is wrong w her??
Thank you again for being real, open, and honest! living alone with not a clue in the world what you’re doing with your life is so overwhelming. Love watching your videos makes me feel normal!
Girl get some room Mates and stop being sad and alone. And go to church.
I love you morgan
omg girl you look amazing at breakfast<3 beautifullllll. i think you're amazing and i love your videos. along with shane and ryland's videos too! fav youtubers! stay strong lady. you got this. i struggle too, for sure. and i relate to you on so many levels. we got this!
I love your ability to be open and raw!
I have never related to something more in my whole life. I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way but you sharing this video helps me ❤️
I literally felt the same exact way last week, I’m just now starting to feel better, you ain’t alone, love you!!
Oh god not another straight white financially privileged girl complaining about her life like anyone actually really cares.
You are so pretty
Are you still friends with Trinity?
MORGAN I think you are amazing!! SAME on a lot. You are doing it so well... and by it i mean figuring out life.
I’m literally watching this wearing the Not Average hoodie 🙈🙈🙈
Soul Cycle IS a cult. Full stop.
Morgan, you are amazing. I feel like you are overthinking and worried about what other people are thinking.  You are beautiful and your personality is attractive.                   Sending you a hug!
My sister has chronic depression and has been pretty close to hurting herself on a few occasions. I think it’s very courageous that you are open about your  struggles. My sister has never let us in with her struggles and this was very eye opening for me. Stay strong!
YOU’RE struggling? Hahahaha. I can barely watch a full YouTube video. Too much commitment. Whereas you...you can drag yourself to a cycle class? You can film, upload, edit a video that will make you money? I say congrats to you! 👏
Omg girl msg me on insta pls lyndsey_zamora I just wanna talk about our problem because damnn I understand youuu🥺🥺
Omg the laughing when you say something you dont believe😭😭
You're not alone!!!😩🤣🤣  No fr tho I feel you girl. I be struggling with living for awhillllllle  now😤😤😆
There is no right or wrong way to feel. We aren’t supposed to always feel aligned just keep riding the wave and pushing on.   As human beings, we are extremely emotional creatures and it’s normal to feel extra sensitive and overwhelmed.  It’s ok not to be ok, but its important to speak to others around you so that you can take a step back and look at your situation from someone else’s perspective so that you can visualise ways to move forward differently ❤️
When shopping becomes that hole you fill>>>
I can not begin to say how much your vlogs on your mental Health had helped me to change my ways and work on my mental health even at 32 I am finally going to the doctors to get help with my anxiety and depression
morgan, baby, I wish i could be around you, give you few advice on depression battling. I straight up know what you are talking about. And it’s really hard to see such a pure soul struggle so hard🤍
You crying while eating breakfast was honestly heart breaking but eye opening for me. Like I’m not the only one who feels like this. Im not the only one who cries randomly and feels so low some days. Im sorry you go through this too. I love your videos and I love how real you are. ❤️
Alright, so as an aggressive loving friend, I would come over and pack your bags and take you to places that will make you happy.  And if I were your friend, I would buy plane tickets to get there and take you to Walmart or something. You are someone who needs to be around people physically and be with someone who vibes with you. I can’t be alone otherwise I will break down. It’s not about being reliant on someone, it’s about growing with someone next to you, lover, partner, or friend- whatever.  You need that Morgan, and I hope you can find it.
This was crazy to watch because I've never quite related to a video like this?
I have never related to anything that made me laugh so hysterically before. I feel ya girl!
girly if you don't move back to Colorado I stg
morgan got a dump truck
Morgan you are brilliant, smart, and gorgeous.  And next time tell that lady to "fuck off" dang it!
Morgan you are a force to be reckoned with! So incredible, funny, kind, strong. Keep doing you girl!
Sis just move back to the 303 and be my best friend already! You’re incredible and you’re so valid for your feelings. I know things will turn around for the best. Keep pushing baby girl you’re doing great💕
YOU ARE NOT STUPID!!!
Morgan, you are amazing and you are enough. Please keep doing these raw videos, you are so special and help me through my tough moments. ❤️
I feel this in so many ways. This is me literally every day trying to get through life. It’s nice seeing big-time creators showing real emotions like real people.
ill be your bestie morgan lets facetime
im glad i watched this after i was having a depressive episode or something along those lines, definitely makes me feel less alone
the fact that all of those sunglasses looked so good on you haha, i feel like none look nice on me i'm jealous!!
Something that really helped me when I used to feel really numb is practicing gratitude. I would write 10 things I am grateful for each morning in detail for 28 days (takes 24 days to form a new habit). It's hard to do it when you are in that state but if you push through, it will change your life for the better. I didn't feel numb after the 28 days were over! I also started recently doing Qigong 10 minutes every day , it's a gentle form of martial arts (kind of like Tai Chi) it's amazing for moving stagnant energy, helps with depression and sleep! Think Vitality with Jeffery Chand is a great youtube channel for learning Qigong!
Something that has helped me post moving cross country and leaving my entire life and having no friends was figuring out my love language and doing things that fulfill that for me. My top love language was acts of service so self care, cleaning, organizing,  yoga and baking/cooking are things that help me feel better. My other love language is quality time, so forcing my self to date myself and go on picnics alone, hikes, reading even though i'm not a reader lolololol I'm liking the book "what I was doing while you were breeding" by Kristin newman.
I have never related to someone on this level and just 🥺
Morgan- I know how you feel... I have struggled for a long time to feel happiness. Stay strong Girl.
Can we be friends and have mental breakdowns together 🥺👉👈 ❤️
Thank you, thank you, thank you, for posting a video that can sum up exactly how I feel. I always feel so close to you, because I can tell we feel the same way about life. By you being strong and brave enough to post this, you are helping others like myself that is working on these mental issues as well, that we’re not alone. Bless your heart, thank you for making a video that I can share with others, that might be struggling to understand why we tend to feel this way, and what it’s like. I was literally already sitting here feeling like this, when I started catching up on your videos. ❤️🙏🏻
No need for gd.
Oh my goodness**
Hope you move out of LA
On 13:12 she looks like a boss women!! Like soo hot 🥵
What is the reason you’re staying in LA? Every time you’re in Colorado you seem at your happiest, I want you to do what you want but I also feel like leaving LA might be the best thing for you :((
You aren’t alone! I definitely feel this way all the time. It’s an awful feeling
Morgan. Thank you.
Morgan, I absolutely love you and you are such a beautiful soul ❤ You don't even know how much I can relate to you and you are so right. You are transforming into your highest self for the betterment of your life. It is NOT an easy journey but eventually it'll all make sense and you'll understand why it happened. I have currently gone through this , still going through it (especially when it comes to friendships) I have recently started up Tarot reading and its opened a whole world for me and I have been able to give to others the clarity and assurance they need. Please if you wanted to, I would so love to give you a free Tarot reading to give you some encouragement that you're on the right path ✨💖 either way I am sending you love and light. You got this girl
I would definitely talk to their manager after this lol
U r doing something right. U r looking and sounding a lot more together than last year. Love ya gurl
You probably will never see this butttt every thing in my life is incredible and amazing. We’re getting financially stable our son is healthy we both have nice cars a great apartment we have incredible jobs and we’re making friends and I’m literally not happy and I want to die and that’s on mental illness. I just feel awful and I don’t have a reason to feel bad I just do. I’m taking anti depressants and I’m getting better. I just still have those days where I wanna die. So you aren’t alone and I love you and I wish we could be friends 😂
bottom feeder is just... a unique choice of words LMAO
never related to a video so much, in the past few months I've felt just like you have this past week but feels good to know I'm not alone. Subscribing!
This is how I feel everyday it feel so good to know that I’m not alone. I relate to you so much and this so much more thank you
Girl GET OUT OF LA that doesn't mean leaving California just move outside of LA
im eating a chocolate  waffle right now and its amazing
I love you mama, you got this! Change is hard but it is good! new journey ahead
I thought your jeans looked nice on you if it helps and hope things get better ❤️
Morgan needs a midsommar group cry
I have always found that having more friends leads to having more drama in my life. I keep a very small group of friends and my life is amazing.
You’d be a good mommy , please take your time, do it whenever you’re ready .. but when I had my son , and I kinda tried to bond when he was in me still , it was like I was never alone even when I was in my bed alone crying I’d be like ,,, oh :. I’m not alone and it helped ... and then I’d just tlk out loud alil and tell him I love him and try to do something like watch a moviee to make me happy ,, now he’s 3 ,, it’s hard but my son is my sunshine he’s so happy and energized 😂it makes u think like wtf i used to be this hype , but it gives u something to do because you want them to explore the world and Experience the things u did like just playing out in the mud , Or going to the park / zoo    ,, I’m on my all alone mommy night 🍷 so maybe this isn’t the best advice 😂 that’s why I said one day .. one day you’ll never be alone , you can even adopt 💕💕💕😇😇
When she is eating breakfast telling herself everything is ok, that is me
Girl, I think you may be depressed. You can have a picture perfect life and still feel sad inside. I think you would really benefit from seeing a therapist and digging into to the reasons of why you feel unhappy and what you can do to change that. Therapy literally rewires your brain and it could give you the guidance you may need. I hope you can feel better 😊.
Thank u for this video. I feel this exact same way and sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy or like I'm not normal. It is very comforting to know that someone is going through the same thing. These are some things that specifically stood out to me; When u were talking about how everything could be fine but u still feel down or sad for some reason, like something is missing and when u said u feel a pit in your stomach. I feel so sick to my stomach everyday because I always feel sad or lonely. It always feels like I'm off and it gets very exhausting, mentally and physically. I hope u feel better soon and u are a wonderful being. U are so kind and funny, I really enjoy your content. And u look absolutely beautiful as well! <3
why are we both going breakdown right now...... literally crying right now
Morgan, you honestly are one of the most amazingly beautiful women I've ever seen. I watch all your videos and you have an awesome sense of humor. I relate so much to alot of what your issues are. I'm 48 going to be 49 this year and I have grown so much since 36. You are perfect the way you are. Just have to learn to see that inside yourself. I love you best wishes.
You know your a grand,other when u look at the DC shoes n say, man those look so comfi... But seriously id wear em...lol. PS you are so pretty and have such a real personality, It is helpful to know i'm not the only one feeling down these days... But Girl u r so amazing and so smart with some of your self reflection.  Even at my old age I love watching you and your brother's content! and PSS Y'alls mom is just the coolest!
The pressure of just existing- thats everyone now struggling during this pandemic. For me, add the pressure of parents having high expectations from you. Im at the brink of jumping off a balcony rn
When you said you’re at a point when you are afraid for the sun to set cause that’s when the bad feelings set in, Ive never related more!!!!!!!!!!!! Morgan you’re my family. Thank u
morgan im so sorry you're not feeling yourself right now :/ I have to say though that you are STUNNING!! i love your style and your soul is so pure and I just want to say that you are loved by so many! for real though you are so hot it's kind of unreal.
Morgan plz talk to a therapist😟
its crazy cuz I literally have  felt like that and tbh I never understood how people can be so effected by depression but then I learned the hard way hope you keep on going forward Morgan
oh my god Morgan, this made me so sad! But I admire your honestly and I appreciate you being so brave in sharing your lows, because we do all have them! It's about time someone normalizes not being okay sometimes! God bless, hope you're feeling better <3
Honey, I love you. What you're going through sounds like panic attacks. I have them too, ever since COVID started last March. Please talk to your therapist or primary care physician about it. I take Busbar & Pristiq for my anxiety, but even on medicine you're still going to have bad days (but you'll be able to emotionally handle them better). ❤
I bought new DC shoes!!!!!
I NEVER COMPARE MY SELF TO PPL EVER.......  not wreath my time no point in it  all, nothing but hot hair waste of time........
Dude ryland sucks. You don’t. Get over LA. Move on. Alone.
You are so sweet and funny, life will get better. Life really is the shits and we have to keep pushing passed the horrible pandemic.  I hope  you feel better it's so overwhelming I'm sending you a big hug,😘💜💜💜😁
Being a young adult is hard... theres so many directions to take and you take one and do a U turn and the cycle goes on.. currently I'm attempting to switch careers but what happens if I get into it and dont end up liking it.. like I'm already starting over.. I definitely felt this HARD when I was deciding to quit my job, wtf is my purpose?! This is just the eb and flow of young adult hood... but on a real note I do hope your getting some amount of help and talking to someone about this
You are doing a lot of good things.. getting up,  going out... all of that.  I had that too... but I couldn't make the efforts as quickly as you did.  I finally am now.. but I had to get out on Cymbalta and that worked sooooo well.  That dark cloud lifted after about a month.  Prozac used to work for my anxiety so well but with my horrible depression I had to switch to Cymbalta.  I'm proud of you.
Morgan’s literally glowing here ! As always
I broke down this week too. To the point where I was on the floor with my head down crying out of frustration, sadness, mental pain and stressed out to the point when I'm trying extremely hard to keep it all together. People love to criticize and have their own opinions but those can really hurt . You just break. I get it.  Update I feel better today(: remember we always have ups and downs in life. We are in this world together.
Your definitely not the only one I get this all the time look ok on the outside but breaking in the inside but your strong and beautiful and you’ll get through it love you so much take care 💚🖤
Life is beautiful ❤ Only think about the positive.  Love u morgan!
I wish I could be your friend in real life and just give you a hug and motivation 🥺
Girl same. I think we can all relate to how you are feeling, especially with what we are gong through right now.
I went through this and was later diagnosed with ADHD!
I’m not trying to scare anyone because I don’t regret it and we need this. However ever since my j&j vaccine I’ve been completely off mentally, I’ve been totally depressed, everything is hard to do (even showering), I’m mad at literally everyone, it’s so frustrating. I feel like a total monster and I’m doing my best. Its just not going well for me.
i know its going to sound weird but i needed to see this video right now. Thank you for sharing
I'm going through the same thing. I graduated college two years ago and since then I've been so goddamn lonely and just trying to live like I did then and I can't, I just can't and I need to realize that
Morgan thanks for the video, I am going through the same depressing stage of my life, and this video really remind me that I am not alone, and it is normal to feel sad and out of control. Thank you
you are beautiful inside and out. ❤
❤️❤️❤️
This video is relatable af
Boo boo you just need a boyfriend...But what do I know im married and im so lonely and depressed..Oh God help us!
This is so relatable, I feel the same way, completely empty. And I totally feel it more at night too.
We should bring Osiris’s back 🤣🤣🤣
I’m sorry for your struggle, Morgan. I cried with you because I felt this so much. I have been there so many times. Hope you have better days soon. Also, you look SO pretty in that red dress. 🔥 I mean, wtf.
Depression is such a MFer isn't it? It's REALLY hard for someone who hasn't experienced it to understand what it's like. I feel the same way as you Morgan. I have really good things, people, and stuff in my life but....the hole is always there. And when you talked about even just getting dressed, and out of bed...ugh it feels pointless sometimes. But hearing someone else talk about the same things that effect me does help. So thank you for sharing, and I love you too.
Take it from a 58yr old mum of three grown sons, depression/anxiety rarely has a defined reason. I suffered with postnatal depression so severe I was hospitalised (not the medical kind either) and I learnt so much from looking back, mainly that some days it felt like my world was caving in and some days 'the sun was shining' but nothing happened to make those days different! My husband has often talked about coming in from work not knowing what version of me would be there, sunshine happy or sobbing because I forgot to buy eggs that day...I noticed you trying to convince yourself that everything would be ok or smiling when you really wanted to cry, pretending to 'enjoy' yourself because you don't want others to worry about you . I saw myself in your eyes, worried what people will think if you fall apart. Teach yourself to be aware that it's ok to have bad days when you're dealing with depression, it doesn't mean you're not getting better, it just means that today is a tough day. Keep a mini journal of good days (or hours) and bad days, over the course of a month try to aim for more good days than bad. You may have already done this but just in case, get your thyroid levels checked (I didn't get diagnosed till I was almost 40!) and your Vitamin B/hormone levels checked. So many people think vitamins aren't important because you can buy them over the counter, but the B vitamins (there's a few) are massively important to your mind and body, I only know this because my thyroid condition means I can't store them no matter how healthy I eat. If I sound like a fruit loop, ask google lol...and please, just don't rule out a medical reason for your anxiety/depression. Sorry for the ramble but I wish someone had told me in my 20's what I know now. xx
My depression has never felt so represented before.  Also, your growth is heartwarming
sending you a virtual, socially distanced hug. Youre not stupid, if thats how you feel - thats how you feel.
Thanks for sharing what you are going through Morgan >< You're not alone 🤎
I’m so glad you uploaded this. Thanks for showing how it is for so many of us on a day to day basis!
My friend just pointed me to your video. You're my new spirit animal. Hang in there, girl. I'll try to do the same ❤️
I am so sorry for your pain but so thankful for your video.  I am sure you've helped others think and keep moving forward like you're doing.  I will pray for you to have peace and a break through! 💞
Oh my gosh Morgan! I know exactly how you feel. That was literally me all week 2 weeks ago. It's not just you who feels this way. The pandemic has been severely damaging all of us mentally. Just keep going! We will all get through this together! This will all be over soon!
Girl I love you. Sending you all my love and warmth your way.
I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!
Love you so much Morgan ❤️ you’re not alone in how you feel. I wish I could give you a hug!
I’m a mom...she’s only 8, but will some day be a woman. Let me just say, as a Mom I can honestly say you are someone I would be proud for her to be like. It doesn’t matter where you live, what you do, as long as you are always you and you’re kind. Do what makes you happy and be your true authentic self regardless of what anyone thinks. ❤️
You’ll probably never see this but I pray that you do. Please don’t ever give up. You are SO loved and you will get through this. This was so hard to watch when you cried 🥺🥺🥺🥺 thank you for opening up. It really helped me too. We love you Morgan!! 💜💜💜💜💜
Hang in there Morgan !  Sending you positive vibes and lots of love and hugs ♥️. You are amazing .... remember that!
That red dress is gorgeous on you!!!
“it’s called a bathtub” HAHA
I know this sounds stupid because we’re so critical on ourselves but you are gorgeous & have the curves that so many girls want, including me. I know we all want what we don’t have, but I relate to you so much. Depression & anxiety can be a bitch, but it’s gotta get better, right? That’s what I keep telling myself. Love you Morgan 💜
I've been same the last week
Listennnnnnn. I’m not just saying this to say this or because I think you need to see this, but I thought you looked absolutely beautiful in this video.  Just when I thought you couldn’t get anymore beautiful, the video come to the red dress and white jacket and you looked flawless!! You have beautiful skin, you’re just simply beautiful! I know you posted this video  few days ago, and I’m a little late to the party, but everyone goes through this sadness in their life.  Just feel what you need to feel.  You’re already figuring it out.  You will eventually come out the other side and better than ever!! You already seemed so much better in the beginning of your video. Just keep on smiling cuz it looks good on ya!! This too will pass my friend....this too will pass!
You are so pure 💓 💖 💛
When you said keebler elf in the DC shoes... A KEEBLER ELF FUDGE STRIPE COOKIE AD PLAYED.
That plant between the two shelves?
Seems like you’re happy at home. Also LA is the most emotionally and physically toxic city to live in. No one would blame you for moving out of there, just not worth it
Man I appreciate how real you are. Thank you. 😘
Thank you for posting this... it means a lot.... definitely many people are struggling rn including me... im a mess lol😅
This made me cry. I feel this something hard and watching this makes me know I’m not alone and things will get better.
This video was so relatable it was refreshing.  I call these moments growing pains meaning the next chapter of your life is trying to start but you haven't figured it out yet.  I'm 28 and I'm having the same issue right now.
Everyone’s emotions are valid. It absolutely does not matter your background, what you had growing up or what you have now. You should be able to talk about your feelings to those important people in your life and if they can’t sit down and listen, then they are not for you. LET. IT. OUT.
Me at 31 with two kids and almost two years out of a 12 year relationship. Your not alone. I’m older and still facing hardships
“I’m getting rid of things, I have too much clutter” “Should I get a pool for my room?!”
That breakfast looked bomb as fuck
Morgan your videos legitimately make me feel like I’m not alone, especially the ones where you’re open about your mental health ❤️
a week in my life before my neds be like
i like the DC shoes........
YES----
Breakdown vs breakthrough....🙏🙏
I understand how you feel about everything, you’re not alone
The no. No no no no should I wear this to the store rn? Haha she’s so funny
morgan thank you so much for putting out such a vulnerable side of you [idk why but I resonated w/u on so many levels in this video whilst having a mental breakdown]. it is just so helpful for you to acknowledge the void and emptiness, thank you for making me feel less alone. love u🤍✨✨
Morgan get a dog 💗
I relate to this so much. Thank you for posting this❤️ We will all be okay ❤️
morgan i went thru the same thing when i was your age..it was one of the hardest things...i had a really close friend group and when i was around 23 we all kind of went our seperate ways and it was really hard for me im really sorry u are going tthru this
Girl please leave LA!
It does get better. U are a beautiful girl inside and out chick. Know what u mean about makin friends. Im 43 n have 0 xx
its okay morgan i  cried over my dad putting vegetables in my spaghetti everyone has bad days proud of you :)
Thank you for sharing this,
Morgaaan! I seriously wanna buy the 9th & 13th pair of sunglasses you showed!😭😍😅 & def the 37th lmao, if you decided to change them from maybe to no hahaa😂 I've had the worst luck with sunglasses lately and can't find the style that I love anywherrrre here where I live in VA😅 I'm glad to see you're trying to stay positive through that week of depression you went through though💜
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ also i relate to the crying eating eggs 😅 and my breakfast is oatmeal and banana too 😂😂❤
I'm very grateful for your existence, Morgan ❤
Girl, I HIGHLY recommend the book "The Art of Extreme Self Care" by Cheryl Richarson. It's a pretty short read but sooooo amazing. It shows us all the ways we are depriving ourselves, how our boundaries with others can affect us mentally, how extreme self care is the key to enhancing our energy, productivity, motivation, and inspiration, and how saying NO to others is a full sentence. We don't need to explain ourselves. We don't need to constantly give to others. We deserve to put ourselves first. We often deprive ourselves in more ways than we can count. I cried reading that book because it rang so true for me. And I also recommend it to my clients (even though I'm a lucid dream coach, it is helpful for EVERYONE to read this book). Our bodies will always be the first to tell us when something is wrong, and we just need to listen to those signals. I don't believe emotions come up for no reason. You're on your way to expanding into something greater which is why your current environment doesn't feel like it fits you anymore, you're energetically preparing for so much more. I hope that this book serves you and I hope that you honor your own needs and desires before other's. You deserve it.
I just moved to a new city by myself and I FEEL YOU!  Thanks for being relatable and know you are NOT alone!
Same boo. Please go get some medical help. Therapy or something. I feel the same when I'm off meds. Ever since i got right meds I'm full. I didn't feel that in a while but when you started talking about how you feel my body clenched and I remembered this is my reality as well. Pleeease get help Morgan.
California sucks. L.A to be specific.
I love u Morgan! &Love the words of wisdom in the end! Ur so smart and sweet bby❤❤❤
I think almost anyone can relate to this video and feeling this way sometimes. 🥺
Morgan, I feel you ): 💜 The ups and downs are tiring and frustrating. There’s no such thing as the perfect life, because everyone has struggles that we can’t see. It’s best not to compare. Hang in there, take care of yourself FIRST, and be with the people who love you, support you, and uplift you 💜  Depression makes us feel lonely. Don’t let it fool you, you’ve got people who love and care about you 💜
Please move back to CO
Girl you are doing it. Sometimes we stray away from the thing we really want because we are afraid that it means something about us if we decide we want something else. I was so ashamed that I didn’t want a goal I worked for and talked about most of my life. I couldn’t even stop pursuing it out my fear of being ashamed of not wanting this thing everyone supported. I asked the universe to take it away from me and literally the next day it was. My life fell apart. When you build an empire around something you don’t want....it takes time...and it all has to come down first. Whatever it is you want....whatever you land on....just remember that it’s ok. It’s ok to change your mind. It’s ok to change directions hundreds of times. You have no one to live up to and no one to impress. Just go where you flow baby girl. I believe in you
You're not alone girl ♥️ I've been feeling off. We're all in this together, you got this!!
I hope you have good recources like therapy or maybe medication if needed, this sounds like textbook depression. And with depression it doesn't matter how much you try or achieve, it is a illness, they go away with treatment, not happy thoughts and "trying". Maybe sounds sucky, but it helped me seeing it like this. The good things are still good but if depression doesn't let you feel the good it's time to get professional help, if you are ready for that. Because that can be a journey of it's own. I hated my first therapist. I feel like it's good to know that they are also just people and some people just don't vibe - even on professional levels lol.  Idk. I feel you, been feeling like that recently too but I know how to take care of myself when I get into deep deeps and how to get out, I wish for you to find a way too.   Sending lots of love and encouragement. Be kind and gentle towards yourself :)
Morgan I literally have been struggling with the same thing right now I had such a horrible breakdown down on Wednesday that I literally scared myself but we here we living ✌🏻
We love you!❤️
I'm proud of you queen
I love you Morgan I wish we could be friends if you ever come to ontario Canada I would definitely hang out and be friends with you stay strong I tried so hard not to cry when you were big hugs 🤗🤗🤗🤗
i felt the EXACT same way last week. 😭😭😭🖐🏼 the moon musta been on sum shit
I'm a bottom feeder to I guess then lol
dont compare urself morgan theres ppl who compare themselves to you ♥️ everyone wants what others have ♥️ love urself moreee 🥺
i literally cried while eating a burrito the other day.
duuuude that week was so hard for me too, i literally melted into a puddle of anxiety for about 4 days.
You are loved. You are super funny and life is not an easy job. Its cool how you put it all out and doing that you help others.. as in everyone..
I absolutely feel how you have been feeling, and seeing you cry and say things that I think in my head but never know how to put into words is so comforting yet saddening at the same time. Thank you for showing this side of you and letting everyone know that it is normal to feel this way, and to not give up because you will overcome it. I wish you nothing but happiness, I know you'll reach everything you ache for.
The soul cycle experience is such a good example of having compassion to others. You never know what they are going through behind the scenes. So sorry you made such a great effort to get out and exercise for your mental health and were broken down by the instructor. You are doing great.
i never related more to a person like i am doing it right now, you are so honest and open about how you are feeling, we need more people and more content like this on every platform. I hope you get better with and within yourself and you are not alone either, you are not struggling alone either. we are with you and we love you and support you. 🤍
I oh so needed that last speech . This whole video . I love you Morgan .
Holy wow do I feel this on an entire different level. You are me, I am you.
For some reason I feel the exact same way, I just can't cry for some reason
Yeah you're right I am a bottom feeder LMAOfaksjdflkasdjfals;kfjaklsdfjas Im screaming
Just wanted to say, this video is more relatable than anything ever. ❤️
Morgan, you were born with a superpower. Your gift from the universe is hypersensitivity. This is one of the greatest gifts passed out. Think of yourself as a young wizard who is fumbling with new magic. I recommend you find a cause you are passionate about and volunteer. Yes,  people born with powers like yours ARE special and lucky. Yes, you may cry and feel emotions at your deepest core, but know inside, the world needs more wizards like you in order to move in a positive direction.
I have always felt this way....and when my counselor or doc would ask are you suicidal or think about hurting other...bc u know they always have too ask if you are manic depressive....and o always said I am not going to Kill myself (I tried but This is once I got over the hurdle of self harm) but I’m not going to try and keep myself alive...if someone wanted to end my life I would f stop them...I just didn’t care. Years and years of this fluctuating between empty and content...medicines that worked and didn’t ....and finally took a stop in drug abuse valley bc I was tired of feeling hating myself for being empty....I didn’t want to feel that I felt empty bc knowing I was empty drove me crazy then I got clean and have stayed clean  ....and when I had kids I was so busy that I didn’t have time to think for myself and that felt amazing not having to worry about me...and now i still feel empty ...still fluctuate but mainly empty...but I have to keep going and I would fight for my life now bc I have my kids...they gave me a reason and a tether to stay here and fight. My point is YOU are not alone and man even though you are numb and empty and u may feel that way forever (maybe not forever some people respond well to medicines, I...just don’t respond to them) get on a quest to search for something that makes you want to keep searching to feel better or feel at all....bc at least if we’re trying it tethers us to better ourselves and eventually maybe we’ll find something....search for hope...bc if u find some type of hope u will  keep searching ...just try to try idk it’s hard to explain sorry this was long and maybe confusing ....
All I can say is "same girl, same".
Girl you are not alone, my bipolar disorder has really been fucking me in the ass this year
I hope we all figure things out♥️
Oh shit, why would you invite your ex-bf just so he can tell you he used to love you in a friendly way? Why would you give him another opportunity to be an asshole? The ex sounds like a loser and a POS. Pretty sure he doesn't achieve anything in life.
Oh Morgan. <3
We love you Morgan!
sounds like you are going through a sort of awakening, beautiful to see you trust the process<3
I've been wearing DC shoes since I was like 14 😂
why the F are people disliking this video? wtf. LOVE YOU MORGAN
Thank you for this. I needed this.
Morgan, you are my favorite !! I love that your intentions are pure and good. If you are happy in Colorado, move back to Colorado <3 you are really cool!!!! & I love your vlogs <3
You look gorgeous in that red dress! You are such a natural beauty!
Can we just be best friends..? Lol. 🤣 I'm relating so hard to this, girl. 💕
I cannot express how much I needed this video. I'm 26 and still so confused.. Thank you. This brought to light some things I've wanted to work on. 🥰
Beautiful Morgan. I hope you are taking some sort of anti-depressant and having counseling. Girl you are the bomb !!! Keep the faith....My Mantra - Remember..the fire might be out...but the pilot light is still burning !!
You are in an interesting time of your life. Your early 20s, you learn so much and it really helps shape the rest of your life. If you do good, and and act right, you can't honestly look back on this time on your life and think you've done wrong. It is brave to keep trying. Good for you for putting in the work and the effort and make sure you credit yourself for that. You'll really appreciate it down the line when you see others that haven't put in the work.
not the right time but i'm dying to know where did you buy the last eyeglasses T-T 13:33
you keep trying and trying. It's one step at a time and you are building good habits for the bad days <3
8:58 is ME I get her 100% for some reason the only friends I can make are fake asf
Are you sure LA is the place for you?
We love you Morgan
You need a roommate somebody to keep u company. But i love you and your videos and i hope you find what makes you happy because it makes me sad to see you this way..
I love the sign off on this video. When my ex husband and i were getting divorced, all I asked was that he make sure the court house would send me copies of the divorce decree and he couldn't even manage that. I texted him about it, and he gave me some lame excuse and I just told him, "I'll figure it out. I always do" and that's when I realized that me doing twice the work to figure it out for both of us was why we wouldn't work
I think you need to start with LA?  Do you want to continue to live there, if so why?  What can you do in LA that you can't do some place else like Colorado?
The top quote from this video hands down is "*gasp* should I put tiki torches in my room to feel something?"
Morgan If you ever need some new friends I am more then happy to be your friend. I live in Colorado :) . Not creeper status, just a friendly person
Please move back to Colorado. I think it will be so much better for you. You seem so happy when you are there, surrounded by your amazing family.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Morgan I would be your friend !   Stay strong girl ❤️
That person that made you feel like a “bottom feeder” obviously has her own self confidence problems. Like who the fuck would say that to anyone? 🤷🏻‍♂️ You’re awesome and I’m pretty sure if we lived near each other we’d be best friends 😊
Through my observations I think anyone not born in California and moves there has a hard time. California is soul sucking and full of misery! Those who are born there are just born soulless and just don't realize it! The saying misery loves company, definitely came about because of California and its natural born citizens 🤣
Morgan, I know how you feel. We may not be going through the same situations, but we have similar feelings. Life can be so difficult, and the weight of the world is pushing us to act fine. However, we have to push through and look forward to the outcomes. Through the process, it’s okay to cry. It’s okay to not know. I’ll definitely keep you in my thoughts and prayers. We love you and are supporting through this time❤️
When it was time to spend my first night in my new house all by MYSELF I couldn’t do it 😞 I was scared, very afraid 😦 I had to go back to friends house that night I told her I was legitimately scared of this new house new beginning. I had left my husband and step son and I never knew how to be on my own but I did know this was a step I HAD to confront 😢 so I did it and it took me a little while to realize that I am stronger than I give myself credit for and SO are you Morgan ❤️ I am also well aware , now, that I need help with my mental health, and speaking about the struggle and the truth in general to other people has helped me so SO much!!! You are enough and you can do hard things ! I live in Ohio and if you ever need a friend let’s Skype sometime! And not just you Morgan , anyone! Who’s going through it ! I’ll be more than happy to talk to anyone and make long distance friends ❤️❤️❤️
I’m sorry you’re going through it Morgan. ♥️  I think you’re hilarious, gorgeous, and such a role model to so many! 🌟 I look forward to your videos because I can relate to them so so much both the good times and the bad. Thanks for sharing with us! ❤️
I'm so sorry you are having a hard time right now Morgan...I have every faith you will feel better soon! Your fans love you ❤ truely. I think you may need a change....maybe that apartment isn't giving you good vibes...maybe you DO actually NEED to move! Also....I WANT YOUR REJECTED SUNGLASSES!!! I have a sunglasses addiction 🙏🙏🙏❤
I'm going through a breakup right now and I just moved to a new city where he was the only person I knew. So I feel ya on the "being alone" thing. My friend came to see me and try to help, but as soon as she left I broke down again.
Morgan! This destroyed me because I never hear anyone talking about how you can do everything right and you still feel so terrible. It's so hard when people tell you just to work out or eat a certain way and you'll be cured. It means so much to see you be open and raw and I literally cried every single time you did. Thank you for being real. ❤️
I feel this video so much and I feel like I needed to see this and hear this becaue ive been feeling like this video for the past two years too
Girl I think Colorado is great for you and you can tell how you change based on where you are and who you’re around.
Love you!!! ❤️
i love you so much morgan and thank you so much for showing us this, you don’t understand how many people you have helped, knowing that they’re not alone, and i hope you feel that too x
literally every different part of this adhd filled video is just literally and unexplainably MY FREAKING LIFE
Oh gawd I'm on your level. It's a break through.
Maybe you need to join something and meet new friends. Or volunteer. Always helps me to help others.
Just know so many people would love to have the opportunity to bringing your clothes into a new life. 🙋‍♀️ LOL  We have your back, you are never really alone. ❤️
I think we all feel the same 🧸
I enjoy all your videos that you create, after this episode i wanted to give you a big hug. Maybe you should move to Colorado.
U r beautiful luv yer show u r 100
All the time.. love you morgan, youre a beautiful person ❤
I have been decluttering too! I don't know what you are going through, but I hope you are okay!!
wait school work? is morgan in school again?
Kebler elf 😂😂
Morgan saying she is okay but slowly descending into a meltdown gives me serious WandaVision vibes from episode 8
morgan is so stunning 🥺🥺
LA really just ain't good for anyone's mental health💯😞
You are not alone... glad to know I am not alone either.
Morgans ex boyfriend sounds 👨‍❤️‍👨
Morgan you are SUCH a cute bubble of happiness even on your worst days, your videos honestly make my day. All your family, friends and even subscribers will always be there for you even when you’re feeling so empty. It’s so upsetting seeing you feel like this but I really do hope you feel better soon. Sending loads of loveeeeee
I’m so sorry girl,  but thank you for sharing because I’m going through almost the exact same things. Just 2 different states and I’m not popular on YouTube. But I can’t handle being alone and I’m mourning my life from last couple years. And regrettable forever 21 purchases😅
Do NOT let people call you a bottom feeder.
I love and believe in you! Thank you for bringing awesomness into my life. <3
morgan..... you've got to try and doo some mushrooms i think it will help you
Thank you for being such an inspiration, you've helped me through a lot by being so relatable and kind and funny :)) Thank you <333
I feel this on so many levels! I'm sending you positive vibes and an air hug!
Thank you so much for sharing this this is literally my life I have felt everything you just explained I'm sorry you feel this way it's heartbreaking just know you are loved and thank you this has made me feel way less alone xx
I've never related more to you then this video. I'm so sorry for those bad days ;( I pray for so many better days to come your way beautiful girl
Love the video I am glad that you are in the right head space I get those moments of constant anxiety and darkness love you Morgan and thank you for being you 🥰💕btw what with that edit effect at 3:40 was it on purpose 🤔
we ♥️ you!!!!!!!!
Fuck this was all so relatable!!!
Honestly i think you need a job where you're around people and doing something productive
Depression is an illness, not a character flaw. The things you have described feeling and doing in this video and others align with clinical depression and anxiety. I hope you’re seeing or open to seeing a therapist.
I would like to hug you.
Girl I’ve been feeling the same way! No matter what I do I’m still feeling loneliness and it sucks. As hard as it is we just have to keep are head up and make it through each day the best we can. Love you Morgan!! 💕
This is the most relatable vlog I’ve ever seen on YouTube and I’m old af. Thank you for being so honest. You are beautiful, funny, smart and brilliant. I honestly think from looking at some of my friends that have moved to LA, it’s so toxic and high pressure. I think if you are a sensitive soul it can be overwhelming. Maybe a more chill area in Cali would bring better vibes and people? ❤️❤️
Hey girl... You're not alone in this, i feel the same Way every freaking day.🤗 It may or may not be great but atleast you keep going and keep your head high.
MORGAN the Universe is telling you to leave LA and move back home to Colorado 🥺🥺🥺
I’ve felt the same exact thing you have. It’s called depression & an aching loneliness. You’ll get through it. One day it will fade little by little. Maybe try finding a hobbie  and try to stick by it. It’s okay if you don’t though.. LISTEN as long as youre breathing, you’re here... IT HAS to get better. Maybe not immediately but hun I knowww it will
It pains me to see someone going through the real hard shit in early 20s because I’ve totally been there. I promise with age and some work it gets better in your late 20s. I totally have gotten caught up in ALL of that, the comparisons and pressure. It will get better and you’ll compare yourself less and less. Wishing you well girl
What was that at the end? Who was the guy? Morgan I feel like I seen a Easter egg and I need to know more!
Your heart felt rant around 16 minutes got me in my feels you sweet summer child your so beautiful inside and out
DC lol As Morgan shoots to number 1 on Wikki Feet lol I love your face and think your home sick for your hometown but I don't know you what ever it is just breathe push through it and reach out to someone you trust if it gets to bad !!!! I hope Ryland checked on you when he seen this.
Can I just say that I've never had more respect and love for you than I do after seeing this video. I enjoy watching your videos and soak up your sunshiny personality, but this video shows a completely different side of you. Thank you for posting this for everyone else in the world that struggles with not being ok. All I could think about the entire time was just how much I wanted to give you a hug. You are beautiful and that red dress looked bomb on you! Glad you're feeling better ❤
Ps... I have those dc shoes also!’ Threw them out
I’m doing the exact same thing!!! I just put all my clothes in the same huge pile and got my sons girlfriend to come over and tell me to throw it out!!!
i feel like you're being toxic to yourself and don't realize it
This whole video made me feel so seen. Thank you for sharing Morgan! I hate you’ve been feeling that way, it absolutely sucks. But, it is really nice to see that I’m not alone & even people who I see having a “perfect happy life” feel these things too. ♥️
You're wonderful and hilarious and beautiful ❤ I hope you feel better cause I know what you mean and it sucks but you definitely are a good person and I love watching your videos  cause you are so fun to watch and I wish we could be best friends with you lol
Women convey Toxic Masculinity too wtf is wrong with that lady
Ugh. Morgan. I teared up every time you did because I felt everything you’re describing and also going through the same thing. Family and friends tell me “oh just come over whenever you want.” Apart of me gets so excited but at the back of my mind there’s dread and just want to be alone. I live alone too (thank god for my dogs tho) and it’s been an adjustment considering he way 2020 has gone and how 2021 is going. It’s not a breakdown, it’s a breakthrough. ♥️
You got this Morgan, I've been feeling super off the past week and I took myself on a five-mile walk, got myself an ice lolly and voice noted my friends to tell them how I was feeling. This vlog was you doing that, keep listening to the universe, and keep working on yourself. Loads of love from teh UK Xxxxxxxx
I really feel this I moved to Wisconsin all the way from Oklahoma and I can’t make any friends because it just never feels right but no matter what you do that feeling ways above you but I’m sorrr Morgan I’m here for you virtually like I’m sending warm vibes and company 🥰
God I would love to be your friend and help you through these feelings.
Thank you for being this vulnerable it really does make me feel like I’m not alone
Awwe Morgan honey, all of your feelings are VALID!! & are perfectly normal!! Thank you so much for always keepin.shit real! That's why I fukn live ur life! Lol momma You are perfectly imperfect & its gonna be ok! On another not is it just me.or did anyone else get Klohe Kardashian vibes from the bright pink dress b4 she put that white jacket on? XOXO 🥰
Also Getting a puppy cured my depression cuz hes needy as shit
I wish I could hug you girl, you're doing amazing, remember that! ❤️
Just get a roommate
ilysm
🙏❤ u
Girl, I went through the EXACT same thing as you. During quarantine, I loved being with my mom, dad, and sister.  When I had to return home and back to "normal" nothing just felt normal. I was at the LOWEST point in my life, I had no idea what to do or what was even going on. There were some things that I did not want to let go of but I know I needed to. But I realized the only way to get my life back on track was to do the things I knew I wanted. I moved back to my hometown with my parents and friends, and they helped me get through tough times. And it is totally okay! Baby steps to getting back into finding your own groove. I eventually got the courage to move out of my parents but stayed near them and my friends,  and let me tell you. I am now living my best life. I understand it is hard to make friends. And I wish I could make friends too, but the mindset is everything! I know you got this.
Get a roommate!
you are the best morgan
Love you morgan❤ Just remember Universe will find the best way for you. You're literally my bestie your videos always helps me when I'm struggling with my mental health issues they just lifts up my mood and makes my day alot more bearable. Everyone goes through this at some point of their lives and no you're not alone.
The fact that I can relate and feel every bit of pain in this video is out of this world.
Morgan thank you for putting this out there and being so real and showing your vulnerable side because it really helps us feel less alone. I relate so much, I’m about to turn 25, I have like no friends, I hate my job, & live paycheck to paycheck, I’ve been trying to move since January with no luck. I feel incredibly stuck in life and nothing fulfills me anymore. I had a breakdown about a week ago and that’s one of many over the last couple years. It feels like bad luck follows me and I’m just dying to feel good again. I hope you find happiness ❤️
Stay strong Morgan and screw those mean cycling instructors! That made me so mad. I know you have the Peloton, and they are so nice and supportive by contrast. It has been one of the only things to keep me sane during the last year. I just use the app since I have an ancient analog spin bike. I can't believe I'm saying this but I actually look forward to my workouts because they are so positive and encouraging. Thanks for sharing your struggles with us, very relatable. hugs.
Girl you look so good
Oh Morgan, I saw my daughter and how she goes through this exact thing and it breaks my heart, to see her go through it, and to see you go through it.  I am sending you the tightest, most loving virtual hug.  Love and light to you, dear girl <3
Omg. Stop being so hard on yourself!  Said the perfectionist who is totally self-critical. I don't want you (or anybody) to be as miserable as I've been. For real! I've been making a real effort to be nicer to myself. You are ok just as you are. Everybody who believes otherwise can cram it.
this stage of you life is preparing you for something even better. it’s hard to mourn the end of a chapter but start getting excited about the unknown exciting chapter ahead
❤️
I completely relate thank you Morgan we love you
Just to be safe, please have your thyroid levels checked. You’d be surprised how much it can affect your mood and body and so many people have an imbalance and don’t know it.
I’ve been through the same thing. 😅
Goooo home to your family !!! You are so much happier there get yourself a nice little place near your family!!
Your body was not designed to fit into clothing. Clothing is designed to fit your body. 💕
My heart goes out to you. I just had such a gut wrenching cry listening to you speak. So many people in the world are hurting and I wish I could make it all better for everyone, even though that is entirely impossible. I hope that in the coming months you are able to find some peace and centre of gravity. ♡
Yeah I think moving back home that’s if your mental state was a lot better at home with family , It would be the best option personally or moving in with a friend.. but just staying alone is never good for your mental state. That’s from experience
You seem happier in Colorado my love. I’m here, I’ll hang out! You’re absolutely right that making friends as you grow older is rough, but there are so many people that are in the same boat.
I literally have felt the exact same way the past two weeks. I’m not sure why. It’s incredibly overwhelming. I actually cleaned out my closet too and have been trying... I hope you start to feel better! You have many people who love you 💕
I’m a depressed 26 year old. Wanna be friends? Oh and I can’t keep plants alive even though I love them. And I break out into random tears. Also you look stunning.
Morgan you are a amazing person anyone will be lucky to be your friend .
This is my favorite vlog from you. I feel the same and I can’t tell you how many times I’ve cried over my breakfast too lol
You can do this !
Thank you so much for sharing this ❤️ for someone who suffers from similar things its easy to feel alone
I felt the exact same way so I started therapy, it’s a bit easier now that I understand where everything is coming from. Take care of yourself Morgan, you’re def not alone.
You either need to work out harder and not with cardio with actual weight training or get back to your therapist and talk about these issues.
We are always here to love and support you, Morgan!! Do what you need for your mental health and don't forget that you're doing absolutely amazing. None of us know what we're doing!! Make time for the things that bring you joy
i’ve never seen anything more relatable than you crying on your breakfast lol thank you for being so real ❤️ we all go through this (unless i’m just weird too lol)
I felt what she said at the beginning about putting good out and it never being enough SO MUCH. I’m glad you’re feeling better and that you shared
I'm 33 and you remind me of a young me soooo much
OMG me crying seeing you cry.  Just wanted to give you a hug.  You are a great person Morgan, be confident in yourself but if you need to let it all out then that's OK to.
This is me. Thanks for sharing!
The part where your in the red dress about to go to dinner. Sounds like me, I’ve been a stay at home mom for 5 years so mostly for 5 years minus maybe 2 weeks I’ve been in my house, mostly alone with kids. I lost myself and I’ve worked on recently learning to find myself and although I’m no where near fixed, I’m starting to feel different. I think everyone being stuck to stay home has taken an effect on everyone, although I was basically already doing that 4 years before pandemic lol. The struggle.
I’m not even sure if you’ll read this but as a 28yr old I definitely went through a similar feeling of what am I doing with my life, I was depressed and in my case overweight, single, and just ultimately felt alone. I was sad that all my friends had moved away and I was still in the same place not knowing what my next move is. I think what really helped me was coming to the realization that I can’t wait for other people to come into my life to be content and happy. I desperately wanted a bf and new friends but I realized if I don’t even love myself or want to be around myself why would anyone else? Routine helped me out immensely. Working out everyday, having a steady real world job where I made coworker friends, and being in a relationship with myself. Put in the time and energy into loving yourself not into becoming the character you think other people want to see everyday. 23 yr old me and 28yr old me completely different but nothing comes overnight. Just remember that you are your own person and you’re the only person that can help you and motivate you and being in a relationship isn’t going to make any feelings of insecurity or loneliness go away. You can be in a relationship and still feel sad and empty because you haven’t worked on yourself. I’m glad I took the time to love myself and be happy alone because I wouldn’t want that version of me to have drained the love and energy out of my current, now 3 year, relationship :)
One day at a time Morgan. Don’t be afraid to ask for the help that you need. You aren’t the first human to go through this and you won’t be the last. You aren’t alone in anything you’re feeling ❤️
After a breakup of a relationship I had for 5 years, my only serious relationship, and cutting all my friends out, I understand how you feel. I try my best and nothing feels right.It will be okay, I think. Every day I live past the breakup is a day I never thought I’d be strong enough for. Life is so hard. But it’s so rewarding in the end.
First world white girl problems. Get over it hon.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for making this video.
You aren't stupid, you're valid. Hang in there girl, its a process. You're doing great! Mental health is complicated. Don't be afraid to reach out to professionals when you cannot find the answers. <3
Love you girl and it’s ok to have these feelings , I myself have struggled with chronic depression and severe anxiety it literally is a day to day battle. We are all here for you and sadly I with too that these feeling would go way but never really does. The good thing from it is that it makes us stronger thank you for being a helpful advocate! Love your vlogs 🙂🤗❤️🤟🏻
I’m so glad I’m not the only one. The way you were so open and honest is amazing and made me realize that’s what I’ve been trying to explain to myself this whole time. Thank you and we love you ❤️
Girl you are so nice and you made progress. Keep on living.. do what makes you happy (move to Colorado if you want to)❤️
It sounds like LA is making you feel like you're taking 100 steps backwards because that is such a toxic place you wanted to escape and it's like now you're back and it's not the same and it's never going to be the same and how do you even enjoy a city where so much has happened that you want to run away from? I worry bout you
The chipper music is trying to take away from how heavy this topic is and I honestly wish it wasn't there because this is super serious stuff :(
I am going through the SAME thing. It sucks. The only thing helping me stay afloat is putting my faith in God and having him fill my inner emptiness. Blessings.
The sunglasses monsters inc bit made me laugh out loud and honestly, I’m in a bad place currently, so thank you!
You and Ryland give me bad vibes... there's something about yall...
You probably won’t see this.. but thank you for sharing these Times! I’m currently at a very similar point and although I’m way better then I have ever been/ not isolating myself it’s is just as hard.. I love you and hope you are feeling better. Xx
Morgan, thank you so much for being so open and honest about how you’ve been feeling! It was so relatable because I’ve been in your same situation and more people need to see and know that it’s ok to not feel ok. And that you don’t always have to put on a happy face for other people. I love watching all of your videos because you’re so real in every way 💜
You are not alone. We love and support you Morgan. You are beautiful and amazing and talented and I look forward to your vlogs ❤
Morgan.. Do you wanna be friends? I mean I’m in Ohio but like how does Starbucks, target, home goods, and Olive Garden sound good?
i’ve cried for the last 2 weeks nonstop omg i’m not the only one
Hey... just so you know, you're not alone. I have felt like this a lot and I'm only 14. You are coping with it the right way and you should be proud of that. I don't always cope the right way I'm not going to lie. Hope this helps you feel less alone or if you don't read this then I hope this helps someone else. I love you girl more then you will ever know. Keep pushing through it Morgan. I love you.
Ok so.. I get ALOT of you are young and manipulated easy.. especially given the current landscape. But do you know how many other people end their life without this toxic "youtube fame" (or clout as they call it).. don't fall for this. Actually support metal health places in your area. Most YT peeps are grifters who feed off your emotions and try to make a buck.
Do you think you have agoraphobia? Just a thought! Girl you're beautiful, keep your head up!
I wish I knew a better way to message you. My name is Ryan I'm 31 I was hoping maybe you'd wanna talk about possibly getting to know each other and see what comes from it's your a good soul and idk just felt compelled to put myself out there. Anyways let me know my email is on my very empty page.
It's hard to learn self-love and peace, the distraction of having people around takes the pressure off from having to learn that. YOU'VE GOT THIS
This is the most relatable video EVER. Girl come back to CO and we can be friends! I’m down to have breakdowns with you as we drive to Starbucks!
I just want to you big hug babe ❤️☹️ You're such a beautiful soul
morgan dont cry i will crie if you crie im only ten but i have your problems and i suports you
Did you ever looked into adhd?
And don’t ever put so much pressure on yourself. Your doing great by simply existing
Morgan.  I know your hurting and I’m so sorry that you feel that way and I don’t know what to tell you to make the pain go away but I hope you know that I am proud of you and You are not stupid for feeling this way. Maybe you should try getting out of Los Angeles and going somewhere new.  Just know that things get better your gonna be ok much love and blessings.
On an unrelated note: that color looks really good on you
don't cling onto la just because it's rylands thing. find your own path
It’s interesting to know how we all have the same struggles at times! I’ve been feeling like this for a while, where nothing is wrong but nothing is ok? It’s so hard letting go and everything in this video sounded like what I’ve going through. Hope you get better soon! Big hug & we can be friends if you’d like💖 love you, you don’t know the joy you bring me when I get to see you, a pure ray of sunshine my luv ☀️🧡💖✨
Morgaan! Can we get an update on the footprint on that yogamat on the balcony?
Girl, I’m your friend. The end.
The birds in the parking lot... me!
I just moved out to Cali alone I have no family or friends and I regularly turn on your videos when I’m eating dinner, feeling lonely etc so you actually have helped me with my mental health and I think it’s important for you to know you’re having a positive impact on people’s lives 💕
I keep seeing things like this from people in their 20's feeling so unfulfilled.  I think about when I was 20 and I didn't have time to to be depressed I had shit to do.  I think when things come so easy it's hard to appreciate what you have which result in this feeling of hopelessness.  Volunteer at a homeless shelter, start a business, get out and do something productive.  I wish I could be too depressed to get out of bed but I have a mortgage to pay.  I wish I could hop back and forth from state to state on a jet plane every time I felt a little sad but my savings account has $2.46 in it.  I think  we have done a disservice to this generation of kids by feeding them from a silver spoon so that they want for nothing and as a result they don't know how to deal with disappointment.
You’re not alone, thank you for showing me I’m not either. I really enjoy and appreciate all your videos.
I was diagnosed with GAD and depression 2 years ago, and it's been really hard. I can't even get a job or drive far away from home. It really sucks. I just want to be normal. I'm 28. To anyone reading this: I pray that every stress, worries, overthinking & anxieties will be swept far away from your life. 🙏🏻
Time to go to nature Morgan.
I appreciate that your education shows. I believe it is psychology right? Keep going! This was a well explained and concise. Good luck with your schooling 😊
I mean you've been going through this depression for what seems like about a year now, lots of these videos, so why haven't you made changes yet?? Everyone has troubles; so many of us have deep depression.
I really don’t know why you all stay in LA. You clearly aren’t happy.
yes can relate sso muh olove you
Morgan I’ll be your friend 🥺
I wanted to say I'm feeling the same way but every time I went to type I just started crying. I feel you. It'll get better, I hope.
Find your groove. It probably is hard to live in a city like LA. Like you did that! You moved and you have your own place, you have responsibilities and you’re doing the best you can. And you are a light. Do a little at a time and don’t have high expectations for yourself because it starts this shame cycle.  Easier said than done... but you got this 💖 love you Morgan.
It’s heart breaking to see others going through this because I’ve been in this dark place and I know how hard it can be. I’m so sorry your going through this you are truly trying your best ❤️
Morgan your a beautiful youn woman and you have a beautiful heart. I'm so sorry your going through a rough time right now. And I pray you find the peace and the right path you need in your life. I love your channel and find you very inspiring ❤🙏. I'm  a 35 yr old mother of two young boys and have been through my own depression. You have a light about you that is undeniable.  Whatever you do in life you will go fare dear! ❤🙏
First of all... I freaking love you, you are amazing and beautiful 💕. Second, I really empathize with you in this video, I'm trying to figure it out too and it's hard but we are going to make it 💪 keep going 😙
did she leave la?
I adore you for showing this side of you... the internet makes us feel like we’re all lost because we don’t have certain things or as happy as others. I feel the same way you’ve shown on most days. I love you & hope you have better days ♥️🤍
Thank you for being someone who gives something that we can all relate to--thank you for allowing yourself to feel vulnerable during a time when everyone is so guarded. <3
This video is making me feel not so alone so thank you. We can do this besties <3
So relatable
You are lovable Morgan. Thanks for the honesty and working thru the sadness Need to do the same
I love you Morgan ❤ stay strong and keep loving yourself more. Things will get better in time.
Morgan Ive been watching you since the beginning and I can honestly say that you have been showing signs of Bpd borederline Personality disorder..i was diagnosed with it last year and I know exactly what you you mean by feeling empty and something is missing even though you are doing everything you can to not feel that way, and seeing your journey and struggles I have a strong feeling that you could possibly be Bpd. I might be wrong but I strongly do suggest researching this diagnosis and seeking help just incase..you might find some closure. I hope your well and I'm sending all the positive things your way. ❤️
Your amazing❤ for how young you are you sound so wise.. Life is HARD! But that's ok it's life everything thing is temporary, it's ok to have good and bad days ❤ I need to remember that too and you inspire that❤
it do be like that sometimes girl 😩❤ also red is your colour queen!! that red dress??? oof!!! 😍🔥😍
Dude :( I'll be ur friend; let's be pen pals!!
Morgan, I appreciate you and these honest videos 💗  It’s okay to not be okay. xoxo
As an older, sometimes wiser person; you are normal! So proud of you getting up, doing stuff and pushing through. You are strong and so lovely. You can be surrounded by the most lovely people and feel so alone and lonely. You have episodes of depression, most of us do especially given this past year and the stresses of being online. Just be aware you can get help if you feel it gets worse. I’m sure you know all of this, I hope all your fans do too. Thanks for posting such a heartfelt, honest video. It’s what we need! Yes sometime life is hard,  but that does NOT mean you are crazy or weird. It helps to unplug from social media and take a walk, read a book, pick up a hobby. Take care of yourselves 👏❤️
Depression is TOUGH. It's a fight we fight everyday, some days are just way harder than others to keep going. Thank you for being vulnerable. Makes me and I'm sure so many others feel less alone.
LA is bad for anyone's mental state. I suggest moving to a not toxic environment. You mentioned that you liked Hawaii. Maybe that would be a good place to be. ❤️
By the end of the video my eyes were tearing up. I can relate Morgan, you're definitely not alone. ❤  thanks for being so open 😊
Red is Morgans color!
Ugh I’m sorry that you have this depression that doesn’t leave even when you’re being productive. Are you talking to a therapist? Please don’t say you’re stupid! The fact that you are up, getting yourself together, looking SO FAB, and making a video!? I’m so proud of you and also you inspire me. I haven’t made a video since November. You are fighting through this girl, that is everything! 💚💚💚
this is so relatable
I know the feeling babe, what you got is depression. Please go to therapy and talk it out, I promise it will make you feel better and you'll find the support you need. Sending you love and light. Also, thank you for sharing these moments on camera. It's important to normalize this feelings, this experiences make you stronger. <3
I hear you saying I try and try and nothing works.  I must say I love watching you on Youtube.  You are one of my favorites.  So something does work....maybe not for you....lol..but we like what you do.  Your honesty about yourself is so inspirational.  Wish we were neighbors.
Same.
I'm crying with you and still everything is fine.  It's fine.
Morgan is the most real person I have ever seen on youtube and that is why I love her, it's not one random we need to talk video its in all of her vlogs and that's what makes her so special. Even if you don't feel loved morgan please know there are people here that love and value you. There are more likes than dislikes. You truly are so genuine and I would absolutely love to be your friend!!!! Please see this lol Ill take us to coffee!
My heart breaks for you. I have been there, please reach out to a doctor, you may have a chemical imbalance.  It will get better. Sending all my love and positive energy you way
Omg... I  love her! 💕
Oh honey. I’m so sorry that things are so hard for you. Keep pushing forward. You’re so strong.
I never comment but I had to on this video. You are real and raw and this helps people see what real life can be like. I have been in the same place with complete life changes and it's been a struggle. Thank you for being honest and showing the real you at a low place.
I think the thing that we all love abt Morgan is that she’s... a /human/ Like the /rest of us/ And she’s still /kickin/
Same.
I get you
Morgan crying while saying she’s okay it’s the most relatable thing on internet 🥺
awe, honey... i wish i could be your friend. i know how you feel, keep your head up.
If I was your mom and I saw your latest videos I would be so deeply concerned that I would be at your house dragging you back home. You need to get out of LA go be surrounded by your family and work on getting better. You are beautiful and smart and funny and perfect and the fact that you feel the way you do about yourself and your life is so sad to see. Take time off of social media, move home, and enjoy life...❤️
this video broke my heart, you're beautiful!
Does anyone else just really want to give Morgan a hug and cry with her?? Or just me? 😅 lol
dont be scared to take a break from youtube and social media ect.
I suffer from dysthymia. I have depression that comes and goes and this video feels like me .... my depression is a roller coaster that comes back up and I just cry and breakdown and just can’t do anything but sleep and cry and blablabla. Why are there so many people depressed ? Clearly the society or something is the problem. Not us. Right? I mean... it gotta be 🥲 anyways love you and thank you for this video. 🌷❤️ you are strong and you help a lot of people to just stand strong and hold on till the roller coaster comes back down.
So I am super conflicted with this video because I teared up several times because I know exactly how you feel and I’m a lot of the times I’m that same head space, but it also just feels good to know there is someone else who gets what I’m going through and knows what it’s like. I’m sorry you feel this way though Morgan and just remember you have an amazing family and friends and all these followers who care so much for you! Ily! ❤️
After hearing this I now realize she can’t actually be independent and thrives off codependency. Get yourself a man or a roommate girl ! You’ll feel better
This past year has been a game changer for everyone.  Change is never easy, especially when it's forced on us.  But, through all this adversity you have clearly bern working really hard on not just personal growth, but life growth also.   I can tell just by the way you are expressing yourself.  I don't hear the constant self knocking you often did before.  Instead, you are being bravely transparent, honest in your fears, yet optimistic at the same time.  I particularly love hearing you speak more positively about yourself.  Yoy are s really beautiful young woman.  In addition, you are quite intelligent and extremely well spoken too.  As sn added bonus, you also have this extraordinary creative side.  The world is your oyster...  Keep reaching for the gold and the happiness you so deserve.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I truly don’t know why she continues to live in LA when all she does is cry about it and complain and never happy. Why does she even live there ? Like does she have future career life goals there ? I just don’t get it
I loved all hey No sunglasses lol
You're such a sweet girl. ❤️
I love that youre talking about this so openly!!! it feels good to know someone is going through a similar thing as me. I had a rough dec and jan where I would cry on the subway every day on the way to work. I started going to therapy and noticed I just feel so much better!! Also, try headspace! I was never able to meditate or relax, but this app helps bring you into the present moment. good luck! it will get better
Guuurl I feel you. But just so u now I love u bestie. ♥
Morgan, if there's any chance see this, I'd encourage you to pray to God! You said you feel empty deep inside, only God can fill you. I've watched your videos for years and it breaks my heart seeing you cry. Please, Morgan, pray even once. Even if you aren't religious at all or anything, at least say one prayer to God. You are so loved and love is not only a feeling, but an action. Ahh i wish you'd see this comment. I'll be praying for you. Love you, Morgan <3  God is beyond feelings, beyond anything on this earth, including depression. He can heal you! Seek Him, Morgan. You're His creation, He loves you so much
Morgan, you are a gorgeous person inside and out. Anyone would be lucky to be your friend. I know exactly how you feel though. Especially about being alone at your own place, I have and still go through a daily struggle with that. Always remember: IT GETS BETTER! I love you Morgan!
You should have put in a complaint, her job is to motivated not shame people!!
✨you’re beautiful, you’re strong. remember that✨ ❤️
You can be functioning and mentally not healthy. But sometimes just doing the things each day is all we can do. One day at a time. One minute at a time. I have been watching you grow and develop over the last couple of years. And I’ve never been more proud of someone I have and will never meet. I relate to the ways you feel. You are NOT alone. Keep talking about it. Keeping feeling all the feelings. Someday the mountains you face now will be small mole hills. You got this Morgan. YOU FUCKING GOT THIS. Remember a lot of days won’t make sense. Don’t dwell on the why. Get through it. That’s number one! Be you. Cause you is good my dear. Sending all the love, positivity, and good vibes I can muster. 💜
Honey, you have so many people here in the comments that would love to connect with you! You are NOT alone in how you feel and you are not alone in the world either! I think you could find some life long friendships down here in the comments love! Hope you are doing well today. Much love to you!
You’ve never been fully happy in LA.   Stop trying to force yourself into something that isn’t you!   Get your ass outta there girl!    Get to Colorado where you shine!    Or somewhere else.....  but stop trying to force LA.  Its not you and thats a good thing, LA is toxic to good down to earth people.
Aww girl! I’m sorry you’re going through such a hard time. I’ve been struggling with my mental/emotional/physical health lately. My uncle passed away unexpectedly only months after my aunt passed away from liver cancer. And watching her body and face change bc of that cancer was the worst thing I’ve ever gone through. It was extremely traumatizing and I was still dealing with that when my cousin found my uncle passed away on his couch. He was holding onto a cup of water and some aspirin. He was literally fine the day before. He died all alone. And now my daughter is having health problems end we’re still waiting on results. It’s been a rough year and I think it’s been rough for all of us. Don’t be ashamed to feel this way or feel ashamed bc you’re trying to fix it. Be where you feel healthiest! If that’s Colorado, then be there! We’re still gonna love you! No matter where you end up. Stay strong girl. Love you 😘
I completely understand how you feel. You are extremely strong for continuing to get up and do things and still go out with friends. I have severe depression and I have been isolating myself for over 2 years. I have days where the only reason I get out of bed is to go to the bathroom. People don’t understand depression is not only mentally exhausting but physically exhausting as well.
I'm 36 and im in your place EXCEPT I'm in recovery... love you Morgan keep you head up beautiful.... omg so sad I turned 37 in Feb I forgot lmao always laugh at yourself before anyone else has the chance 😅
So many others feel exactly the way you do Morgan.  You are not alone. ❤️
To be honest, it takes one thing to set off someone that deals with depression and other mental problems. I deal with depression, although it isn't frequent as it used to be. That instructor would've probably triggered me into a depression. It is actually, imo, unprofessional of her to do that to you. I would've replied "Actually, I have social anxiety where I'm terrified to talk to people in person (obviously, not on camera on You Tube). Thank you for making me feel like shit! Congrats, this will be my last class with you." Watch her expression because sometimes I don't think people, who can easily talk to others, realize how hard it is for those of us that suffer from social anxiety or just being shy to talk to strangers. I'm real sorry she triggered you to feel the way you felt. And you're not toxic. You're the one of the sweetest people on here.
The only person you should compare yourself to is who you were yesterday 💕
From watching this video and others you have recently poster it seems like LA isn't your thing. It just isn't a right fit for you and that's okay. It's perfectly fine to move on and move to a place u feel happier in
Honestly, I feel like we’re going through the same thing, especially with not being able to make friends and the whole trying not to cry, but saying you’re fine (literally had my own little breakdown a couple days ago, lol). Like I understand 1000%. When I first started watching your videos, I immediately wanted to be your friend, which probably makes me sound crazy, but I always loved your vibes. Thank you for making this video, makes me feel less alone in this crazy world. Keep being you ❤️
I struggle with this overwhelming feeling .. even if it's the tiniest little bit of strength, use it
During the process of exposing the persecution of Falun Dafa, I have encountered many people who expressed their support for us. Their stories were very touching and I would like to share them with you.  I came across a gentleman in his 70s. I told him the facts about Dafa and also planned to give him a keepsake. He took one out from his pocket and told me: “I already have one! I recite 'Falun Dafa is Good, Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good' daily. My health has improved. My memory has recovered. I feel like a young man. It is amazing! Don’t you believe me? Let me show you.” He began running around me, and also recited several ancient poems to show me that his memory was just as sharp.  One day, I met another gentleman in his 80s. I handed him a brochure about Dafa. He took it and asked how much it cost. I told him it was free. I told him the facts about Falun Dafa and the ongoing persecution. When he understood the facts, he began shouting: “Falun Dafa is good! Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good!” He added: “I am not afraid of anyone. I will shout even in front of the government.” “Falun Dafa is good! Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good!”  After I clarified the truth with a third gentleman, who is in his 80s, he held my hand and said: “In this society, there are too few people like you. You are truly good for others. You are so kind.”  I clarified the truth to a younger man. He said to me: “I have been to foreign countries. At tourist attractions, Falun Dafa practitioners' display boards and fliers are placed in public places, and pedestrians passing by can take them as they please. They are all free. This is really different at home and abroad! Two totally different worlds!”  One person once told me that he enjoyed the truth-clarification very much and really appreciated my efforts to bring the information to him. His longing for the material really motivated me to go out to reach more people.  I talked to a vendor at a market, who did not look like an average farmer. I thoroughly explained the basic information about Dafa and the persecution. He understood and told me that he has a friend who also practices Falun Dafa and is a really kind, genuine person. The friend was persecuted for his belief and had not been released for a long time. Towards the end, the vendor agreed to quit the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and related organizations with his real name.  I went to distribute desktop calendars at a market at the end of 2017. Eight people came and asked for it. I persuaded them to dissociate themselves from the CCP and its related organizations to be a free person. One after another, they told me their names and which organization they once joined, and asked me to help them quit.  At another time, I handed a middle-aged man a copy of Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party after he learned the truth. He totally agreed with me and kept nodding his head. He told me that he had a relative who was a college student and shot to death during the student protest at Tiananmen Square in 1989. He urged me to watch out for my safety.
You need to do what makes YOU happy, whatever that is. Facing your problems can be painful, but it will also set you free. Also thank you for sharing your struggles it makes me feel a lot more human and okay with what I'm going through.
Y’all will literally fall for anything, anyone can throw a bunch of clothes on their bed and say they aren’t feeling it
I think I'm 95% okay ☺ and for sure will send you a prayer or two 😘 love you Morgan 💕✌🏼
I feel this so much. im from MN and moved to California. every time i go home and then come back to California i get so depressed its crazy,
This was me this past week as well, concluded with a full blown breakdown yesterday😭 but the emptiness remains and the exhaustion of it all
I am actually on the same boat as you Morgan. I have been doing my schoolwork, making myself busy with my friends but I am also going through a hard time with my mental health. you got this!
I feel the same way
100% same.
lol
Ok
Me yesterday having a panic attack getting my vaccine I’m the shyest
It's amazing how you were able to put into words how I feel every day.
Thank you for sharing! I cant imagine how hard that is. We're all here for you !
Omg this vlog gives me life. I just had my own breakdown week so this made me laugh really hard. Who is this soulcycle instructure from hell?
I’m so sorry you’re depressed. I understand.
I’m so glad you uploaded this, I thought I was the only one who felt like this. I also didn’t have the words to say what I was feeling but seeing it shows it perfectly ❣️
Honestly you should report/contact Soul Cycle about that instructor because that is not uplifting or encouraging at all and you are an example of how that type teaching can be extremely harmful. This past year has been hard on everyone mentally and being yelled at by some cycling instructor is ridiculous and uncalled for. Report them💅
Morgan you look so pretty! I hope you feel better soon keep talking about it! X
first of all, morgan you look incredible in that red dress 😍 second, you are such a beautiful person, inside and out. i’m so sorry you’re going through this with your mental health, especially knowing how it feels so heavy and horrible having been there myself before, but i am SO proud of you for keeping on moving, cleaning, getting dressed, exercising, taking care of yourself in general. that’s so hard to do in times like depression. please be kind and patient with yourself. you’re doing all that you can and this painful season will pass with time. i love you! 💗
You're so genuine... ❤️...
dude, all your feelings are my feelings :/ making friends as an adult is mf difficult
This is really brave of you to post this. It is good to get it out so others can feel like they're not alone. Thank you for posting this. <3
hooooly moly sis !!!! i never knew some people experienced the psychosis spirals i had in my brain !! u are not alone!!! thank you + the universe for the impeccable timing of stumbling on this video !!
Girl you are literally rich and have no need to seek a real job, get some therapy and use your privilege to learn a new hobby, stop bitching you are so damn privileged 😂 Ppl like you always say LA is filled with toxicity, no! It’s the ppl you surround yourself love.
It's okay to be not okay. 💚💚💚
I’m praying you find your comfort in your own home. You are doing wonderful, and it’s going to be okay.
This is the first video of yours I've ever watched but I just wanted to say thank you for sharing this. I've been going through it too recently, juggling college, a social life, and finances have been a drag so thanks for uploading this and letting people like me know that we aren't alone. We gotta pull strength from each other.
Morgan is me. I am Morgan.
I’m going through a similar process right now recovering from changes in my life. It’s so hard, thank you for sharing your feelings.
This video helped me a lot today... thank you.
It’s ok to be sad … you need just to take a break and you will be fine 💛
She is callign you a "bottom feeder"....whaaat?????
Morgan trying to convince herself she's happy to be here is all of us 😭❤
Morgan,  you need to relisten to the first 3 minutes of your ranking Girl Scout cookies video, your journey goes up and down constantly ( just like a lot of us, never balanced and in the middle) but try and focus on the fact that, it goes and sometimes it goes up
MORGAN IF YOU EVER SEE THIS - I SEE YOUR GOOD ENERGY AND YOU ARE A GOOD  PERSON! Aww the cat agrees!! Beepppp!  Get  yourself some Sansevieria Trifasciata hahnii plants, they dont need  that much effort and they give you more plants over time, I have had  like 100+ plants, given away, some have died, but I have like 40 in  various sizes at any time..  IM GETTING ANGRY - wtf is it WITH  SOME PEOPLE - I was sent to this exercise group, when I am techinally  BURNED OUT and no one can bother to give me a proper diagnosis, because  fatphobic doctors are a huge issue and that's a life changing thing I  have learned the last 3 months.... But my point, I was in this group,  that I didnt need, what I need is MORE ENERGY, not USE ENERGY, and they  first of all expected everyone to DRIVE there... Secondly, they expected  people to know everyones name, and we would have these warm ups based  on tossing a ball, say, "hey Morgan", and toss it to you, and you would  go "Hey Shane" and toss it to him, and he would go "Hey Ryland" - right?  Yeah I have NO MEMORY, so this was horrible for me. My hearing also  gets bad when it's a noisy environment... So I wouldnt really hear if  someone shouted my name! And this was described as a "low threshold for  exercise" group. No. I dropped out after 2 times. Call me a bottom  feeder, at least I am not a over privileged ableist and high threshold  scam!!!
wow I could relate to so much to the things you talked about in this vlog. Thanks for Sharing. I hope you are doing fine:)
i literally relate to everything. i think you should think about moving to Colorado?!
find someone you can live with maan, I feel how you feel :(.
i relate so fucking much to this vlog...
GIIIIIRRRRLLLLLL.......GO HOME LOL its okay you not a city girl you can work any state you in
Girl this video was so relatable currently feeling like this we can do this!!
i feel u ❤️
Jeez this hit me so hard. I really connected to this. I’ve been feeling this way so much lately and it’s so nice to know that others feel this way too. Love you Morgan. I hope things get better soon!
good, I want you to struggle.
Really wish we were best friends. I relate with you so much and also think you are hilarious! and such an entertainer. ❤️❤️
Girl get out of LA its so toxic! I’ve never regretted getting the hell out of that city!
not me sobbing.... 😭
Morgan is exactly like me omg
Morgan, im feeling everything you’re going thru right now too. Thank you for being honest, it helped me a lot to know im not alone 💖
I fell the same too and I am very much dying. I dont feel like eating anymore and I dont have motivation to do anything anymore 😧
literally the most relatable video ever
Girl.... I see your struggle. I feel your struggle. Because, I too am in the struggle. Like, I know my life isn't bad. I AM privileged far beyond many others. So, why do I continue to be so fucking down and wish so hard to be back where I used to be?  I know you don't always believe it, but your strength and willingness to speak your truth... It's a blessing to so many of us. Thank you!
Love you and I'm praying for you! Im going through the same. Also i absolutely love all of your clothes. Absolutely love your style
Right girlie.  You need to go speak to someone it's OK we all struggle. But things will get better I PROMISE. Maybe you just need to go home re connect with you're old gang be you again. You can do so much. Set up a little business connect with new people focus on you beautiful girl. I wish I could just give you a big old cuddle. We love you. All will be well x
thank you for always being so real on here. i know it makes so many of us feel like we are not alone. i actually would encourage you to try maybe going to church, or getting some houseplants and learning about them and taking care of them (really helpful for me), to go thrifting, to journal, to read. i love that you've gone out and tried like soul cycle and some different things, too. just a few ideas of things you could do that are different but maybe fulfilling in some way <3 lots of love
I literally relate way too much. Please make more videos like this!!!
dont rush yourself either uwu it takes time
I'm not ok I put so much work and sweat into making my video and youtube doesn't recommend it to no one 😭😭
I feel this so deeply... everyday is a struggle to wake up and do stuff. I cry in the shower, when I lay down, when I’m driving.. in the middle of a movie. That’s not sad. 😅👀... Morgan you are super amazing and real... You’re not alone.. keep your head up.
This is exactly how I feel, but I hate my life and it's really not great. It's hard to be grateful for anything when you feel like this.
Thank you for showing the other sides of you, we need more of this on social media so others don’t feel alone and can help eachother out. Your a queen in your true self 💕
You look fucking stunning in that red dress, love you always
Wow... You’ve got a lot to learn about the world... Lmfao one would think you learned that already but guess not
Morgan you are Beautiful and an amazing Person! Decluttering your closet helps and DIYs. I have to do alot before my mom comes to town this weekend.
Thank you for being so open and honest with your struggles you make me feel more normal and I even had a little laugh not because you were crying but because I do the same thing.
This is soooo relatable. I had a melt down last week because I was having to walk to work because my car was in the shop and I couldn’t have my daily car cries after work.
What ever happened with her eye? Did I miss it? Is she ok?
you are the best. done and done.
I love you Morgan and I will forever be proud of you <3
coming from a fitness instructor... those gals should be a FiReD....
I need friends too so I feel you there. I want a pin pal like old school kind :P I so would do that!
Thanks for this video!!! Btw I’m from Brazil and I am a big fan 💜 you have a Brazilian fan
Wow we both went through it durring the same week <3
“Back row bitch” 😂 ME
You're truly such an inspiration. This is the kind of content that people need to see and know that its okay to not be okay...better days ARE coming!! We love you Morgan!!!
Go see a therapist not YouTube.
I just love you so much Morgan. Never change. You are perfect. ❤️♥️
Sweet girl. Thank you for your honesty. You are no doubt helping others by your honesty.  I don't know if you will see this but I'm a psychiatric nurse practitioner. I enjoy your videos and  I've watched you for a long time. You are a great person. There is nothing wrong with being sentimental/caring/being yourself. I can say that from today's vlog, you have exhibited classic signs of clinical depression . I know you had a rough time with the medicine you tried before. I'm not medically diagnosing you or telling you what to do. I just want to validate you. You can do EVeryTHING perfect and still have depression.  If you could stop feeling this way, you would. No one chooses to feel that way. I would just say that when you feel ready, I would strongly encourage you to talk to a doctor-even your primary care doc or OBGYN. You may not need other meds but please keep your medical team in the loop. The pandemic has made it more difficult to be a young adult trying to make your way in the world. Keep up your great work and thank you for sharing what you have been dealing with. :)
Homegirl needs a blunt 😌
This hit so hard for me. You spoke the words I feel but haven't been able to say. Thank you, Morgan 😊  And thank you for sharing your struggles in hopes to bring light to mental health and for showing the reality 🙏 Sending you good vibes love 🤍🖤❤
Wow you need to get your life together being alone isn’t the worse thing seriously life changes all the time
Girl i feel you and i love you girl!!!
Omg that’s so relatable. Except I became addicted to m3th and h3roin and got on disability and lived in a trailer in my moms back yard for all of my twenties. I recently got sober and honestly trying to start my life up again feels like I was dead for a decade and I don’t recognize anyone or anything anymore.
YOU'RE A QUEEN AND I LOVE YOU FOREVER <3
I feel this. I just spent the last 5 days in my bed with the window blinds closed. Sometimes it's easier to binge TV in a dark room rather than confront all of the difficult feelings and changes in life. I hope to start faking it 'till I make it and I am so proud that you are able to find the positives in life despite the challenges you're currently facing. Also, I am terrified of being by myself and this vlog made me realize I need to address that sooner than later. Thank you Morgan for being so transparent and real. <3 Nothing wrong with leaving LA.
Morgan ❤ it was like watching myself here. I tell myself to keep moving forward as I cry over my breakfast every morning. Don't be afraid to let the sun set because it will raise again tomorrow
🎻👌...⬅️worlds smallest violin for you. 🙄
I’m so very similar to you Morgan. I think the best thing is to be where you are happiest, maybe L.A is not it for you. Either way you deserve happiness. Maybe therapy would help as well.
Morgan, thank you so much for this. Stay strong❤️
I love you Morgan
I relate so hard.
on the realest note, thank you for being so transparent and honest about your mental health. you've always been someone that I look up to and can connect to. im so proud of you for fighting through the dark days and pushing on. it makes my feelings with mental health validated and that im not the only one in this weird world who feels that way. ily bestie
Growth is hard. It’s sooooo effing hard. Going through it with you, we feel you Morgan!
Who what when why where and why are you in my recommendation
You’re fine. As you grow up you keep less friends around you and purge the non essentials. It’s normal. 👏
Who are you
I use my likes sparingly.  You’re a lamb ♥️ relatable 🧟‍♂️
I love that you’re able to share this kind of stuff that you’re going through because mental health is no joke. Have you looked into or heard of Transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment?? It is something that has had great results for many different types of mental health conditions and especially depression and anxiety.
We’re all on your side Morgs!!
Also, I found this out from my last home. Energy and bad energy that has happened in that house, saying like “spirits” can hold bad energy. We ended up moving and my life changed instantly. It could be residual energy in that house you stay. Maybe a good cleanse? This is just a possibility.. always good to try something to boost your energy and give you more space to heal. Good luck to you girlie💕 you’ve got this!
Are you on anxiety meds? I had the same exact thing happen to me last summer. And you feel like you should be able to fix it on your own but you can’t.
Me laughing at Morgan crying over her eggs because I'm her.
Morgan, not to diminish your pain but  for relativity , you said get by day by day - I am  - I am handicapped recently and being domestically assaulted daily here in Ireland , where the vaccine will not come to me until December , live in a hospital bed , and you are right - my pain is no bigger than mine - physical pain and mental  are both overcome - if your spirit is strong - keep the faith lovie ... I will  if you will - I am on the cardiac transplant list  for a decade ... no surgery in Ireland is elective - but today was better than yesterday... love from Ireland 🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮❤️❤️❤️😷😷😷🍀🍀🍀🍱hospital food mukbang! make everything a ritual - your curves are beautiful.... when I moved to Europe my body was celebrated ... reset your social medias - new interests ... new bios ... watch  a new genre of films - I adore Ari Aster films fabulous now ... ❤️❤️❤️❤️ 🍀🍀🍀🍀 you are gorgeous , know that ...
I watched this...and thought “ok maybe I’m not alone”. Thanks Morgan. For being genuine, for sharing your ups and downs in life, and for just plain being you. And as for the “soul cycle person”, well probably just one of those people who needs to make others feel bad for themselves to feel good, find a new sport that makes you feel uplifted 👍🏻🎈
Hormones and lonely. Great way to work it out. If you were in a room with all of us. You would feel that we are the same. You will get thorough it. It gets easier. Plus school is hard... Or everyone would pass.... You are wonderful and beautiful. Id Love to look like you... So pretty. I hope a nice person comes and captures your heart and treats you well for the rest of your life
Honest to God we are the same person!!! I feel the exact same way, especially about trying to build my future life while looking back at my past life and trying to somehow make them the same when I know for a fact that can never happen!!! Girl I’ll be your friend!
oh poor baby. get over it.
I just noticed this video doesn’t have ads
Start a depop! I loveee your clothes!
Thank you for being real and raw! I feel like this most days and it's nice to know we aren't alone. Sending good vibes your way ❤
Girl get a depop!!
Thank you sharing and making us feel like we aren’t alone🥺I completely understand how you feel and I thought i was wrong for feeling alone and empty in my daily life .
Morgan I’ll be your friend anyday!!! Hope you feel better, and well done for cleaning out your closet that is a CHORE! And that red dress on you😍😍😍😍😍😍 wow xoxox
Morgan, I’m sending so much love to you. I can very much resonate to what you’re you’re feeling. The one thing that’s helped me was Jesus. He’s the only reason I’m alive today. I would deeply recommend you find a church. It can be such a start of healing, I definitely was for me. I am praying for you!❤️
Thank you for sharing this ❤️ you’re not alone.
I love how real and honest you are! Xx
Morgan I wish I could hug you, just know you are not alone and You bring so much joy to other people's lives. Sending love💜💜💜💜
Ok you’re a blasphemer! I’m no longer interested in your pathetic problems!
Girl, you’re way too hard on yourself. You’re beautiful, you’re doing fine. Don’t compare yourself to other people. Everyone is different. It’s going to be okay :)
Literally Morgan I fully fell this and I get it Morgan allow yourself to cry girl deal with everything as it comes your 20s are meant to be the hardest time in your life
I am homeless living in my car, working gig economy. This seems fine. I have a friend that constantly fakes possitivity and gets mad when I don't hooray all day every time I see her. I have very limited energy, don't eat regularly, and don't make enough money to put a roof over my head. She complains to me about not being to buy the perfect b-day present for someone, not being invited to parties, etc. I keep saying, "I am homeless", and she just keeps talking. I finally told her I can't be around her anymore. Too toxic, ignores my suffering, treats me like a soundboard. She knows I don't eat everyday/regularly, yet texts me about restaurants she eats at, it got really weird. Her other best friend just exploded on her and cut her off.  She is toxic but doesn't admit it. She is a Tony Robbins person trying to become a trainor, that is the scary part.
Girl most of my favorite YouTubers have left LA. GET OUT OF THERE AND THRIVE.
Awww kid. Thank you for uploading
“Im really struggling, boohoo i will make a video for youtube”.   Fuckoff! why does youtube keep recommending absolue shit like this?
God, I feel this so hard. Just sitting there saying it's ok, i'm ok over and over. fuck, I'm sorry you're feeling that way too. Being alone is an adjustment, but it can be nice. Quarantine is almost over and you can go out and do things and see people/ have them over or go over.
Thanks for showing us emotional Morgan 💕 some days can be a real struggle and don’t make sense. Other days are amazing and everything clicks. The trick is to realise that life is a stack of uno cards, just play em and see what happens. Luv and hugs M 🥰🌟🍸
💜 embrace the sunsets. Find the beauty and calm in the small things. You will find your peace. Oh and btw you look absolutely beautiful Morgan. Get yourself a new plant. An easy one to care for. Plastic plants need love too.
Girllll. I think the phrase is “life pushes us until we are ready to be pulled”. Be nice to yourself! Easier said than done but babe! You are so precious Morgan. Thank you for sharing this! I’ve been there too, oh so many times. It’s bad ass you shared!
Shane?
Morgan, you are loved, you are cherished, you are fearfully and wonderfully made.
Who wishes she would send her give away clothes to you for free
Morgan i have so much respect for you. You are a beautiful soul and are beyond strong enough to face these problems. Take it day by day - dont rush the process. We love you
1st world problems .  I want my 2 minutes back ...
You should try Win Hoff breathing it really helped me when I felt like this 😊❤
Morgan... this would be the most powerful video u have made. Well done. Without you knowing you have reached out to so many people. Thank you.
Morgan... you have no idea how much I needed to hear every word you said in this video.  It makes me so sad to see you so hurt.  You are such an amazing, funny, beautiful, kind human being.  I want to wish you the best luck in your journey to overcome these feelings you are having. Just keep reminding yourself of the positive messages you spoke throughout the video.  Keep surrounding yourself with people and do things that simply bring you joy.  I can guarantee that you bring them joy too, by just being you.  This too shall pass.  You’ve got this, girl ❤️
Aw Morgan please be kind to yourself! You are doing the best you can and you are amazing! You will figure it out. We love you!
I love that you shared this. Definitely so relatable, thank you.
You look like an angel in that red dress!🥲❤️👏🏼
Hello Blessings ❤️ we know that right now we are going through difficult times but, Would their be hope for all this? If you would like to know more go see this link, thank you.
Hahahahaha no one cares
Sis have those moments where she feel like she's dead inside. Sis is me. I am she. 🙃
Quit Youtube, quit being an inflencer, quit social media,  helps from being depressed and may help from being a suicide stat. Get a real life !
You gotta get off of social media
Advice: try saying positive affirmations to yourself every morning and try meditating or manifesting positive things in your life
Lol you are a youtube crying lol lol lol
Go get a real job and contribute to society
You’re an amazing person, and that will not be taking away from you. Try to keep up the faith
Morgan, I literally have the same issue between home and a new city and it is a struggle but as you said you know who in your life brings you joy and so just focus on spending time with them/talking to them as well as enjoying your own company too!!! Inspired by you x <3
Nobody cares
💕🙏
Thank you for sharing this Morgan ❤️ I hope you find some inner peace and clarity.
Hope that your mental health straightens back out. I've been struggling recently because of the loss of a couple friend's. I take an anti depressant but atm nothings working.
Mate I feel you in this video! You got this 👊 you're a good person
What we say to ourselves and aloud is what will show up here. The universe does not take things away from us unless we project that out. The universe gives us what we think and feel to be true. Change your thoughts girl and your reality will change with it ❤️ also I know you feel overwhelmed like you have so many issues to fix at once but you can fix them all at once by changing your thoughts to my life is always unfolding in a sweet way, things are always working out for me, or do a remember when thought .. remember when my life was frustrating? Seems so long ago because now I’m happier than ever.. what I’m trying to say is if you change your mindset to think where you want to be and feel (Instead of focusing on this reality you don’t want) the 3D will match your thoughts real quick. Listen to some Neville Goddard on youtube ❤️ sorry I keep editing this as I listen to you. Every person we encounter in this illusion is simply reflecting our own inner beliefs about them and ourselves .. they are a mirror ... so if you believe someone is a dick or sweet as pie they will reflect that back to us!reality is beautiful after you figure out we control every single aspect and just as easily we can morph into anything we want! We all figure this out on our own time.. you’re getting there and you’re doing amazing. Believe in yourself, that’s what you’re here to learn the universe is inside of you, every part of this is all about your Morgan you’re the star actress and you get to write and direct the movie of your dreams xo
I never really realized just how much you look like Dominique Swain when she was 17. You cry like her.
Thank you so much for this video. I've been struggling in the same way. It's hard to put into words how bad nights are just like you said. When everything goes quiet it hits differently. You have so much support Morgan. Thanks for speaking up for those of us who aren't strong enough.
Morgan sweetie, please move back to Colorado, please. You are soooo happy there with your family <3
You are so strong
Oh Morgan, I have never felt more seen watching this because depression really steals all the moments...good and bad :/ I’m broken hearted for you but also want to hold you and cry with you! Bc SAME TO EVERYTHING. Also you looked BANGIN in that red dress and that whole clip! 🥵
Morgan, you are so brave - you do all this stuff despite the emptiness and pain that you struggle with. Cut yourself some slack, you are truly doing the best you can and you should be proud of yourself. You work so hard towards becoming happier and more content. My advice would be to let go of the idea of "rebuilding" your life. It doesn't need rebuilding, it's already here. Just allow yourself to be where you are at the moment, despite the suffering it causes. Sometimes we struggle so much with things we cannot control, while all we have to do is just focus on breathing and trying to live every day bit by bit. You will figure all this out. I was in a similar situation not so long ago, thinking it will never end, but it did. I can't say I'm 100% happy 24/7, but it got so much better. Breathe deep and keep moving forward, and even if you end up going slightly backward - it's okay, it's still progress. It does get better. Sending so much love.
i feeeelll you soo much!!!!! stay strong girl! you re not alone
Poor baby 😭 i just finished a deep crying session with my therapist, lets all cry together 😗✌️
The “connected , disconnected, connected, disconnected, connected, disconnected” voice on my ear pods sum up exactly how I feel at the moment.
You’re beautiful.  Just know that you have to learn coping mechanisms in life and you will be just fine. I could write a book of my depressing life bullshit. Just try not to let that part of your brain take over.  YOU GOT THIS GIRL! ☮️✌🏻💕🙏🏻
Morgan, please please take as much time as you need. You only have one mind and body, take care of them, if means dropping out of youtube grind, please don't feel guilty! I'm 23 in the UK and I see so many similarities between us, I'm also living alone trying to imitate the past. But I need professional help and my family right now, maybe you do to, there's nothing wrong with that. It's not permanent, and it's not forever, you're not failing, you're growing.
girl I felt this. depression is so deceiving and so crippling. I think 2020 has been especially hard for those of us who already struggle and 2021 was hyped to fix it all.
You are SO self-aware, it's incredible. I'm also letting go of things at the moment, and the grieving process is different for everyone. You're right, things do and will get better- you're a lovely person and I'd be your friend in a heartbeat, I'm sure many others will feel the same. But yeah- soul cycle is a miss. You could get a peloton bike (I think that's how it's spelt...?) instead- and do it from the comfort of your own home. Go to CO and buy a fixer upper- you seemed at your happiest in the room makeover videos x
This vlog is just what I needed to not feel so alone. I have been going thru it to kind of a quarter life crisis 😅
Literally no one cares. She's going thru shit, but let me record tho. Pity party if I ever seen one. Clickbait AF. Stop it
I don't know your age but when I was a junior in high school (11th grade), I knew with a fair certainty exactly what would dominate my lifw, and there was nothing that would ever divert me. I realized that I needed to navigate life alone, and on my own. I do not get depressed or worry a great deal. In the process of writing my 5th fiction novel. You need to live life and not be concerned with documenting your existence in vlogs.✔✔✔😎😎😎 Ultimately, you need to figure out what you can be obsessed with, and become an expert in that field. And I would hope that whatever it is, never stop learning and don't necessarily look for teachers...
<3
Take some advice from an old lady, learn to make being with yourself fun and fulfilling and you will always be happy. It is a skill you can learn by working out what brings you joy and making it part of your day no matter what. Put the same importance on it as you do on eating well and drinking water
I think ur really pretty, but I do understand hw u feel
Why are you in my recommended I don’t like you
Can we just talk about how good Morgan’s skin looks now? We’re so proud of you, your progress is showing and your fans are always gonna be there for u
Who gives a *****
I balled my eyes out to this video. I lost my mom back in Jan and I swear to God the only thing getting me by is my cat..and my friends. I can’t function right at all. I find myself wanting to give up a lot. But I’ll be okay, we all will  I love you Morgan
thank you morgan for sharing your raw feelings this help rise the awareness on mental health and i hope it helps you overcome negative thoughts too
i think a lot of people can relate, im so sorry you are having a rough time. sending you positive and healing vibes all the way from new zealand. hang in there, youv got this. you where born to stand out.
Morgan, I don’t like being blunt like this because people hate Bible thumpers, however, you really need the hope and peace that comes in finding your identity in Christ. There is overwhelming evidence that the scriptures are valid and trustworthy and you should put your faith in a God who cares for those who are traditionally uncared for. Start your journey by watching “The Chosen” tv show. You may not understand the comedy behind the nuances in the character’s personalities w/o biblical knowledge but the show is so good and entertaining and it’s straight from the Bible.
Online school has made me so unmotivated and sad. And I do the bare minimum. God damn that shity corona virus.
You poor thing. It breaks my heart to see you like that. I myself feel exactly the same way. I tend to give myself 1000000000% to every friendship that came to my life but it was NEVER ever reciprocated. I am now almost 30 and only have 1 friend from high shool. Making friends is definitely the hardest thing when people are not forced to be around you constantly (like school). I am so sorry you're going through it. If we lived closer I would definitely reach out to you 'cause you deserve to be treated better
I've never seen one person have so many sunglasses...new, with tags still on them...and clothes. It's almost obscene how much "stuff" this chick has accumulated.
Awww I’m sorry that you feel this way. I can so relate. You’re blessed, pray. Stay positive. At least you try. ♥️🥰
you just extra version of the population
Observe everyone.... This is the generation that will be responsible for the death of earth's entire food chain
I thought I was the only one who sleeps for a week at a time to escape. I feel better when I deactivate my social media  but I always come back which makes no sense. I’m not good at making doctors appointments because of my anxiety but I feel so much better on medication when I do go through with check up to get my prescription. It’s night and day difference...just wish I didn’t have to check in with the doc on a monthly basis to get it. Morgan, u are so brilliant, funny and beautiful- I wish u could see how lovely you are. Hang in there, we got this!
This is distasteful... Your struggle is so real like those tears for the camera..what happened to people...I've never in my life been so Ashamed of my country and its people .
Thank you so much for sharing your feelings and just being real. I feel like so many of us can relate to it. It’s refreshing to see a realistic vlog and not just people glamorizing every day life. You are loved, and you are beautiful, and I just wish the best for you. ❤️
Yessss! I'm so glad you spoke out ♥
Morgan, believe me, it sucks but it does work. A lot of bumps and disappointments along the road - lessons, naiveté, trust issues - go through it, beat it! I don't know you but I do feel like you are a good person through and through. Chin up! I usually have good instincts but I think you are quite the sceptic when it comes to you lol so just keep on keeping on. I love that you chose to make this video. It helped me and it certainly helped many others. I hope it helped you too. And again, I believe in you. 100% for all it's (not) worth. 💖
Seeing you sad is so sad for me. I am glad you feel better now, but remember it's okay to feel okay. You also look INCREDIBLE in that red dress look.
I’m not alone .. 😭 thank you for this whole video. Start to finish.
Ur not alone girl
I feel like I have rocks in my stomach and my throat is closing....this is everyone Morgan. It will pass, just breathe, please!  🧡🧡🧡
I’m crying over here. Morgan you are beautiful in and out! It pains me to see you like this. You’re a kind soul that deserves all the happiness in the world. I hope you find it! I’m rooting for you! Much love!❤️
I have left my house four times since the beginning of January. The only person I see is my son who lives with me and my stepdad when he comes to get my son. I cry every single day and every night I pray not to wake up. But I get up everyday and keep going. So yeah I feel ya Morgan
Morgan needs a healthy loving companion !! Because this life is so hard alone, I pray this for her🙌🏽🥰💗🙏
Sometimes I think yt is not for everyone. And LA is not for everybody. Because you have to deal on your own with everything, work, sociallife, lunch, dinner...
Those DC shoes were cute!
me, myself and i
I'm really worried about you. Please know you are not stupid and you are not alone. Try and stay with someone because those thoughts can be dangerous and super scary when you're alone.
Why the fuck am I here?!
I’m glad you exist 💗
I honestly wish I had that much clothes...
I think you will learn a lot about yourself when you find someone to share your life with. With that said I think you need to feel good before you can attract a healthy partner that does not bring you more down.
God heals the broken hearted. Prayers your way. The world/universe/people/things won’t make you happy or filled, only God can.
That line about toxic ppl is so true! Love u!
these comments are so rude wtf is wrong with you people
This video just reminds me of Mathew 5:3
Who the hell are you
So I'm currently on day 3 of a major depressive episode and I'm in pjs in bed in my apartment on my own. Yesterday I left the house and tried really hard to go through the motions of my day. At the moment in just proud of myself for having eaten and showered in the past 24 hours
I can relate I am graduating college and I am so scared because I know nothing will be the same and I know I can’t compare it’s just change is scary for me so I relate and thank you for showing this
I understand 💜❤️💜❤️
Who else got here through YouTube’s algorithm ?????
I'm sorry that you feel that way Morgan. Just know that even though we don't know each other I still care about you and you're not stupid, you're very smart, funny and beautiful.
"Someone could kill me and I'd be like... I bet they had a good reason!" That is about the most relatable thing I have ever heard.
So, I never post comments on YouTube in general. I felt like I had to because.. well idk. But Morgan you’re such a cool person. I love that you posted this video and that you’re so comfortable explaining how shitty life can be sometimes. I completely relate to you. I’m about to graduate from undergrad (after 7 years whoops) and I’m trying to figure out why I’m not turning in assignments and such. You got this, we got this. Sending you positive energy. I know you don’t know me, but if you did, you would know that me saying that is INCREDIBLY off brand. You’re not alone. Do you girl.
Morgan.. I think you really need to leave LA. It just seems like that place sucks your happiness away. It doesn’t mean you’ll move and everything will be fixed, but it seems like such a source of stress and anxiety for tou
Therapy.
You ain’t struggling that much got ya nails done and new stuff in ya house 😒💅🏽🤣
Being afraid of the sun setting...yeah I can relate
I love that you are able to share these type of reflective vlogs regarding your mental health.
You need Jesus hun. Period.
Ok so gotta say that admitting that you’re struggling and stuff is really healthy but who are you and why are you in my recommended section
I'm praying for you! Girl, you are so strong and so beautiful! You will get through this- one step at a time! Try to have patience and kindness for yourself!
I could not care less.
Thank you Morgan. The depressed folks needed this. ❤️❤️❤️
I've never related to a video ever before this video I completely feel all that I was diagnosed with GAD and OCD and I have come so far. You too have come so far.
Thank you so much 😍 thank u for showing me im not alone and know ur not alone mental health sucks 😔
What brand of sunglasses are those at 12:47?anyone know?
I admire that you continue to push through the hard times it definitely isn’t easy
Woman moment
Clearly LA is just not for you.... You have the ability to move wherever you want with nothing holding you back Morgan. Not many people are lucky enough to be in your position.
This vlog has never been more relatable, I’m so thankful that you expose yourself in this vlog bc it makes me feel less alone... I have felt the same feelings you discuss and glad I am not the only one. Please keep being transparent so much love for you hope the blogs keep coming ❤️
you are a good person, its the pain of having a big heart and prespective of whats really important. um also i have been getting worse with this and anxiety really enhances and triggers it so ive moved to decaf as a start to reduce anxiety.
I am too. It will be okay
what have you “lost”?? your FAKE friends?? 😣 go volunteer at the animal shelter or BBBS if you’re good with kids and want to make a difference in someones life. there are so many things you could do to make your situation better or make yourself feel a little less like shit. also stay off instagram lol
What happened to trinity?
This is the most important post you’ll ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Surrender your life to him now while you can, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... And as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Girl I’ve been going thru it too ! Just remember you are human and everyone goes thru something similar! Keep doing what your doing , your here for a reason!   Meditation 🧘‍♀️ has helped me a lot 2X a day! Keep your head up! Luv ya girl !
The sun setting comment is so relatable! You aren’t stupid for thinking that at all ❤️ day and night really make you feel two different type of ways when you’re going through it. Lots of love and hugs! ❤️
morgan you are never alone! you explained exactly what I feel about my life while sitting in front of your laundry pile, and just know that I was one of the ones you helped to know that they’re not alone. i wish you well because days like these are tough, but your great, keep doing you sis ✨
Love you Morgan!!!!! 😭😭❤️
I am so fucking grateful for you and this video
✨h u g s✨
girl i just want to give you a big hug 💖 you are loved, you are wanted, and you are so worth it.
Morgan!!! If anything, in the future you could have the best of both worlds after graduating and gaining more financial stability by living it up in Aspen or Vail. You could have the bougie lifestyle aspects and material spoils similar to LA, while still representing and benefiting from Colorado’s values of empathy, compassion, and down-to-earth authenticity. There’s a reason so many famous actors love to escape to mountain towns in Colorado bundled up in ski gear that makes them unrecognizable. LA life can take such a toll on one’s wellbeing and sense of self. But in Colorado, kindness, or at the very least mutual respect, is the default no matter your class or creed. I know you know this, because you embody those aspects in a way that’s so comforting and relieving to see!! Every time you open up in a video like this I feel so seen, so validated, and I’m reminded that I’m not alone in my struggles or experiences. I cannot put into words how hopeful it makes me for the future when I see more and more people giving success to people like you, instead of people whose intentions are based in a mindset of competition, scarcity, and greed.  Morgan, you are exactly the change we need in the world. But I don’t think you have to be directly at the physical epicenter of superficiality and toxicity that is LA to keep doing what you’re doing to improve the current societal paradigm. I would hate to see your inner spark dimmed before you can grow your platform and change even more lives for the better. You’re so right about the universe presenting us with the same lesson over and over again until we learn and decide that we deserve better and are ready to move on and grow. Once we stop wasting our time and energy, there’s so much happiness to be found. And if not happiness, contentment. Confidence in the fact that we are living up to our true potential.   You have always only ever done your best, and you have always only ever tried to feel alright. This is fundamentally true for every single person on this earth. There is no shame in it. I wish with my whole heart that you are able to really, tangibly feel how loved you are and how much good you have done for so many of us. Even if you don’t feel it, I know with every fiber of my being that the good you have put out into the world will make its way back around to you soon enough. :•D <333
Morgan thank you for your vulnerability and honesty throughout this entire video 💕 so incredibly proud of how you walk through your bad days and keep yourself moving and stay productive. Talking through your struggle was SOOO relatable. Appreciate you so much!
Morgan, I’m sorry to hear about your loss of friendships in CA. You seem so happy hanging out with your family. I hope you can create the joy and peace that you desire. It’s not easy coping with loss. You’re beautiful & amazing. You deserve the best in life.
This was amazing. You are inspiring.  💙🙌🏻
Stop being obese
I know you don’t know me, but I really admire you Morgan. I see you as such and strong and independent woman, you are the best Morgan, things will get better, don’t give up. Sending you the best vibes!
YOHANAN(JOHN/JUAN) 14:6 "I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME" "YO SOY EL CAMINO Y LA VERDAD Y LA VIDA. NADIE VIENE AL PADRE SINO POR MI".......
Okay, me.
This is the most relatable YouTube video I’ve ever seen. I could feel your pain through the screen, it was heartbreaking and reassuring all at the same time.  Love you 💕
You're doing a great job. 🖤 Sending one of those really tight hugs where you kind of sway and get teary and feel safe.       And let's be real, that was the first and last walk with that plant #sheneededtogo
It really seems like you need to get out of LA.
Morgan my love, you definitely aren't alone! I know exactly how you feel! There are days I feel just like you, no matter what I do life just seems so hard regardless of what you try to do. I lovee youu sooo much Morgan and I'm soo proud of you for being able to open up and talk about all of this!!
Morgannnn! You’re absolutely not alone, you’re like 22/23..  I’m 22, I’m going through the absolute same bullshit in life, it feels impossible to have friends. And even when I do make a friend I have such shit communication... I hope you come through your break through soon 💕
This is amazingly relatable! Thank you for being so authentic! Even though you are having a hard time. You can tell that you are growing and dealing with your feelings in a more mature. Your honesty in your journey though life is deeply inspiring! I hope you are talking to someone though. Sending love! You are amazing!
I think the hardest thing about anxiety and depression is it isn't contingent upon on your blessings. I realized this after I experienced PPD. Like I had this beautiful baby, supportive family and husband, financially keeping our heads above water, roof over our heads, food in our bellies. But I was experiencing the most severe depression/ anxiety I had ever encountered in my life. My brain chemicals didn't give a fuck about how good I had it. I couldn't pray/gratitude my list/selfcare myself out of a chemical imbalance. I just had to get honest about how I was feeling to even start the process of getting out of it. I had so much shame to say I was depressed when I had so much good happening in my life. Grateful for those who didn't judge me when I told them how I was feeling. Sending you so much love, Morgan. You're not alone.
Morgan, thank you for sharing your vulnerable side to us. You are so brave. You are a beautiful, caring, funny & smart woman. Don’t ever doubt yourself.
Love you Morgan
Thank you for sharing this. It made me feel less alone. I know exactly what you’re going through because I am going through the same thing.
from the start to the end i relate :(
Why tf is this recommended 😭😂
I completely understand what you’re going through and how you feel. Last summer I moved to a different state and I felt so empty and alone even though I had my family, who I love so much. It’s hard to see you go through something similar, because I know I felt terrible and I’d never wish that upon someone else. Though I went through troubling and depressing days, I still had Jesus who fulled me up and made me feel whole, when nothing and no one could. Praying for you. Much love❤️
omg hi Morgan I had this mental breakdown today and I just really felt 9:00 to 9:07 I’ve never felt so down in my life but I’m trying. I am🥲❤️
Thank you for posting this, needed that
Girl maybe this is a sign that u need to move back to Colorado
I just want to give you a hug so hugs from Nashville but anyway I would love to be your friend . You have such light & I hope you find the finds you deserve .
Maybe it's the covid that is making you feel this way it takes alot on uohr mental health and if ubwant to be with your family u may need to love to your parents and u should if that makes you happy
Okay Morgan I'm gonna get all mom like here.  You are gorgeous as you!  I appreciate that you are sharing the "I don't know what I'm doing "with us cuz we all go through it,  especially you young ones in your twenties. I just really wish for you to be you not everyone else and for you to love you as you. Okay I'll stop now.  Oh on the other hand I think you would be an amazing comedian.
can we talk about how this is trending?
You’re doing so much better than you think, I’m proud of you and everything will fall into place. I promise  ❤️
Morgan you are such an inspiration. I’m so grateful to brave young women like you who share their mental health struggles. As a society we have to end the stigma on mental health disorders. I often feel like I’m losing my mind and losing control of my life. It’s so hard for me to share that with people. I fear the stigma. Thank you for being so transparent and shining light on mental health. I have the upmost respect for you! I love your outlook on life. Always remember to be kind and forgiving to yourself too. You are an amazing person!
How tf did this get in my recommended
Soulcycle sounds lame lol Cyclebar gang
I don't like to admit that knowing other people are randomly crying into their eggs makes me feel a little better about doing it myself. Somebody asked me the other day why I'm depressed and I think you said it best, I'm a different person than I was a year ago and change is hard. Thank you for sharing this struggle, it's nice to feel seen.  Also "it's called a bathtub" almost made me choke laughing. <3
You're a fucking warrior. I don't know you but I'm so proud of you. You said you feel stupid but you're honestly so damn intelligent.
Hope all is well
TMI
I’m near the end of the vlog now. I wish I could give you the hugest hug. And I think we can all understand feeling so empty and sad. Sending so much love & care to you.
When I came off my medication - the waves of emotions coming back was something I had to ride out until everything stabilised months and months later. And then if that's not enough, you need to re-learn all of your habits again to manage your mental health all on your own. I think you're riding the wave. And that is growth. That is progress. You should be so proud! You're self aware and know exactly what you need to be doing, it just takes time. ❤️
mental health is so important, It's really important to be aware of. I'm proud that you are and that you make videos on top of what you are going through your honestly an inspiration and don't listen to any people hating because they are just bored and decided to try to make you feel like shit when they are feeling like shit.
Mourning past friendships, the life you used to have, and the person you used to be is something I was never told I’d have to do, but I really wish someone had. My life is also completely different from how it was a few years ago, and for about three years I was unconsciously digging myself into a pit of loneliness, disappointment, and depression comparing my relationships and personal life to how it once was and to other people. I was so scared to change that I had rather let myself become more and more miserable instead. I felt lost, purposeless, and out-of-place for so long. I had opportunities to change certain aspects of my situation but the fear of the unknown stopped me from acting on them. It was exactly how Morgan described it in this video, the universe will tell you when it’s time to change but if you keep ignoring it, the more painful life becomes until you finally listen. Over the past few months I’ve had to learn the difference between missing something and wanting it back. Identifying the things I missed but no longer wanted in my life moving forward was like a weight being lifted off my chest. You can hold onto the memories and lessons from your past and still allow yourself to move on, to heal, and grow. It’s a daily struggle and I’m still trying to figure out how to let go but I’m grateful to be in a much better place now. I pray for anyone out there who is going through a hard time, I promise you are not alone.   “Change will come when the pain of staying the same is worse than the pain of changing.” - Tony Robbins  “The people who are meant to be in your life are the ones who know how to gently wait for you to heal.” - Anonymous  “When you go through deep waters, I will be with you. When you go through rivers of difficulty, you will not drown. When you walk through the fire of oppression, you will not be burned up; the flames will not consume you.” - Isaiah 43:2
Either you're actually missing a part of you that used to be there or you're going through a breakup/friendship breakup, the way you talked about feeling empty even tho you were doing the things you loved with school and friends I felt that when I was missing someone in my life so bad nothing was filling the void but seeing him even if from far away I still get that feeling of emptiness when i think about him and it's been two years since I last saw him, I'm not trying to assume why you're feeling the way you do but I think we all can feel that specific feeling from completely different reasons. I hope we can get over everything and move on happily 🥺🤍
Please don’t feel stupid. I understand exactly how you are feeling.
Morgan, honestly you seemed a lot happier in Colorado around your parents and grandma. I realize u might want to prove that you can be happy in LA but for who? If you can, buy a place in Colorado and move home. Seriously. Your spark is gone when ur in LA.
literally me rn struggling with school. I keep comparing my life to how it was before and my life is changing everyday. It’s so hard to accept change
You are so funny! And let me tell you... you are beautiful.. I wish I looked like you... you really are so pretty
Lol I went to one and only one spin class my whole life and it was torture I was dying and was in awe of the people's thigh muscles cause my thighs were crying out for help. You should go somewhere else that doesn't verbally abuse people lol it'll be okay!
Girl. I’ve been in the same place, like I just want to sit down in the middle of the street. Not moving. Done. It’s such a weird and scary time. One step, one day at a time. ♥️
11:04 I'm fucking screaming! This was me 3 days ago when I pulled out all my levi's shorts to wear for summer. I immediately said fuck it and went online to buy comfy shorts that fit. I don't have time to feel shitty for the quarantine wight gain! lmao! Morgan is my spirit animal. She's the realest bitch on YT right now.
morgan this is so fucking relatable u are not alone
yo dis salt and ketchup bussin
I had such a hard week and it was my birthday last week &  since ive been in such a funk 😐 so i get  it  girl 🙄 I love how transparent you are hun cz i think most of us can totally relate & it helps us not feel so alone in this crazy world .. i guess these days do always pass by & swing back around so its all going to be ok as long as we stay in the fight 💪🏻💪🏻 thank you Morgan...You are such good soul 🙌🏻❤️✨💯💯
This is gonna be long and I don’t think you’ll see this but Morgan I’ve been trying not to watch your video nothing on you but my life took a horrible turn and I’ve been dealing with it for a couple of days now from moving out of a home I worked hard for and and losing my job that was my passion but I finally watched your video now and I can’t 100% relate and am so so happy I finally watched it.  You my not think you are doing anything when you are crying but when I was crying with you as my pain was killing me and my mentally was gone I am listening to all you said and feeling it too, it’s crazy that I am 30 and single and you relate to me so much it’s hard it’s so hard I totally am not happy but it’s gives me hope so much that someone else is relating to me and is really your so honestly real.  I cant thank you enough Morgan you are keeping me alive and making me hope for better days please keeping it up and please don’t lose hope cause you really are giving me hope. We can both get thought our mental health together ❤️
I just love Morgan I feel like we can all relate to this Queen
Wow so sad I’m obviously crying sob sob sob
And you
i can be your friend sis, i understand your pain and its a good thing just letting it out some times
Get a roommate
Morgan, you should listen to Justin Bieber’s new album!
perhaps doing something to help another individual and not being so focused on making money and buying things may help your self esteem
16:00 yeah, me too. I've been proud of myself for doing more but my mind is so exhausted after making myself breakfast or anything else simple.
As a mom, I just want to hug you.  As someone with depression and anxiety I empathize on such a deep level. My son experiences  a lot of what you explained. He's 25, 3 states from home, successful, productive, independent, but lonely. I feel your generation has a loneliness problem and I wish I could heal that. Just know you are smart, beautiful, and worthy of joy.
hey morgan, i feel you recently i stopped eating so much and everytime i eat i feel sooo guilty. i hope you feel better, i just want someone to relate to me <3
Maybe its not LA vs Colorado but Living with people vs Living alone.
Morgan, you are so beautiful,  inside and out
I’m crying Into my spaghetti right now so don’t feel bad. I needed this video, you’re such a bright energy & your content makes my shitty life better so thank you for that ❤️
See help blame your parents and move the F on
3:26?
Your not alone Morgan everyone is struggling with this current situation happening in this world. Don’t watch the news it’s all fake .
I would have gotten off the bike and walked right past that stupid soul cycle teacher
This is so sad to watch. I feel like you have been punished for what went down with Shane and that's not fair. None of that is on you sweetheart. You had the highest of highs that most people will never experience. It's like a drug now you are facing the comedown. I hope you find some peace soon.
Maybe I’m not alone. ❤️
Theres always better daysss! 😘 I am sooo you girl. Watch Eat Pray Love and then let me know what days to request off and buy the tickets 😁💚
Oh my god Morgan... this is your sign to go back to Colorado. LA is soooo bad for you :( you were so happy back there and as soon as you came back.
Stfu
Anyone who is feeling alone after being around a lot of people.. it’s called perceived loneliness and it’s totally normal and valid to feel that way
related to this in a way i can't even describe lmao, i promise you are not alone in this
girl go back to colorado!!! you’re so much happier there!
I feel the being alone part, my family is on the other side of the country. I am finally moving back after 5 yrs. I can say I’m depressed and express it and why. Virtual hug from a Canadian and Cats are a blessing when their people are hurting
It’s so nice to hear someone articulate how I feel
Secs
“I am just going through it right now quite honestly. “ *starts to cry* *is holding back tears* “It’s ok it’s ok it’s ok” BUT WHY IS THIS SUCH A MOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDD.
I wish I could be with you and help you purge to cleanse the soul. I feel you so much right now... my mind is just stuck at a 4-way stop sign with nobody knowing who goes first. I get it.
Love you 💕💕💕💕 You are enough, Morgan and you are a beautiful, lovely person inside and out
I gotta say, I’m still waiting for the “feel better” day lol hope it comes soon
Who is this person????
Damn even if I’m not having a depressing day/week etc I would NEVER be cheering on other people at a workout class! Like bitch you’re lucky if I show up alone first of all, then I’m just there to not speak to anyone because I’m antisocial. Hell no
Thank you for being so transparent and making me feel not so alone
Needed to see this video thank you so much for the video 🙂
why is this on my recomended i have never even heard of you
Aren't we all eating the same shit sandwich?
I feel exactly the same atm my whole life has flipped the past 1-2 years nothing is the same and it’s so overwhelming I ended up crying other week because I wanted my old life back but was I even happy then it’s so horrible but Thankyou for opening up xx
This means so much for me to watch Thankyou for opening up I feel like this and it’s so hard to explain because you feel fine but not X
It's hard to make friends because we've all had to stand still for over a year! It's ok not to be coping with this craziness, you're not alone.
Anti depressants? Physiatrist? Get yourself them!  (that's not even a joke, love you, and seriously feel you in this video 💞💞)
Aww Morgan:(
Hey! You're gorgeous, genuine, kind-hearted, and you've got this!
You can be in a room full of people but still feel totally alone. This is depression. I have been there many times over the last 10 years, it feels like your never going to feel ‘normal’. What is ‘normal’ anyway! Some of us just feel things harder and have a different way of processing things. It will take time and energy but one day you will realise it has been a few days since your last bad day, then it may be a few weeks, then a few months. You will never not have bad days but you will have more good then bad. Be happy on your good days and enjoy it 💖
Girl. It’s insane how much we have in common mentally and physically and just everything I will totally be your friend and we can either grow together or we can cry together 😂
Honestly I think LA is the thing that the universe is trying to get u away from
You’re definitely not alone. Trying to figure stuff out too, and also trying to get a job as a tattoo artist 😆 wish me luck. Things will get easier. Hang in there ❤️
You actually went in though. I went cuz I got the $115 membership in December for the one opening in Redlands in January. Wellll I found myself outside of the cycle place and couldn’t go in. This is the same reason I stopped going to the gym. I can’t go in the gym if I don’t go with someone I know. I get anxiety right in front of the door. I feel like everyone is judging me.
Thank you for making me feel less alone.. ❤️
Okay... Morgan... I honestly think you should move to Raleigh, NC, and be my friend. My friends and I love watching your videos and I think you would really like it here lol ^.^ I
Believe me, no one cares!!!
Oh! I just want to give you a big ol hug! ❤️❤️❤️
"It's not a breakdown, it's a break through." Morgan, I have never felt something so deep within my soul. It made me cry. I'm crying with you, and we're 5:27 into the video.
You're doing great!!! You have bad anxiety. I blame your mom lol
Never heard of this girl and evidently this whole video is just her whining? Why on earth is this person trending? Am I missing something? I'll never find out because I can't finish watching.
Awwww Morgan 😢  ♥️ cheer up! Sending you positive vibes!
Hope your feeling better if you need a freind to talk to im always around
oh dear, how sad. never mind.

Lol good
Love you you can do this ❤
I'm sorry who are you?
I've been waiting for a new video from you. I was worried about you. but I was hoping you were enjoying life and your family and the holidays.
This broke my heart to watch. You’re doing the best you can thats all that matters! :(
Love u so much!!
Awe Morgan 😢 You should def seek a therapist, and also a homeopathic dr. I feel so bad, we are all going through something. We are all here for you.
We 💖 U
Keep struggling
Yooo anyone else feeling this EXACT way and want to support one another/make friends!? I'm literally so alone and would love to find my people!
I'm a certified fitness tainer and a strength coach and a former athlete, what this trainer did was totally unprofessional and you should report her. I'm really sorry that you went through that experience it shouldn't be like that at all.
Wow, wish I was a narcissist and hot girl so I could get paid to make videos about myself
Thanks again for being real, lots of people only see the glamorous side of influencers. You being genuine and vulnerable will get you so much further in life. You will forever be you and we appreciate that! Someone who struggles with mental illness this is relatable. I wish I could give you a hug(no creep attended) you got this girl and  remember some people are only meant to be in our lives for seasons.
Honey, we women need a MAN to keep us level headed now a days. You’re gorgeous inside and out, I know the right man is on his way to you. 💋💕
Girl, you don't always need a reason to feel depressed. Clinical depression does not need a reason to be. Idk if you already do therapy or some sort of medication, but what you're feeling is why those exist. Trust me, I had a legit crisis/panic attack/breakdown during a workout after having the most put together month of my life.
Honestly I’m so proud of you for posting this. The part where you talked about doing so many things but still feeling so empty and heavy is the EXACT feeling I’ve been feeling for so long. Like idk but you described it SO perfectly like,,,,,,, I do so many things to make myself more productive but I still feel so void, like I don’t think anything is making me genuinely happy. Thank you for posting this because you made me feel less alone in this world. I hope the both of us and everyone else feeling this way will keep going
I feel a lot of this recently too
Decently pretty? Morgan you are sooo pretty like damn
Jesus Christ is our savior and God loves you! 🤍🤍🤍🤍
We are here for you morgan I see a lot of comments on here that love you and it will work out for you.
Good news is you’re #28 on trending
Morgan!!! This is the realest thing on YouTube rn I appreciate you transparency 🥺👉👈
BYEEEE this is literally me every other day. You’re not alone. Also I can be you’re friend. Lol. You’re iconic.
I one bagillion times understand how you feel. I also hold on to my past and wish I could have as much fun and to feel as free now I can’t even get out of bed. You had said you don’t feel that great even though you are getting out of bed everyday and getting ready. I envy you for doing that. That needs to be my next step. Thank you for being so open and honest. We need more of this from others.
I also threw all my clothes in a big pile and had a breakdown. Highlight of this past week 💁🏻‍♀️
Sucks to be you
Oh my gosh, she just reenacted my whole of March🤕 what a rough couple of weeks, I'm getting better but what a wow 💔 sending positive vibes to everyone
morgan: everythings gonna be okay *starts crying* luv u!
Youre annoyed and depressed about a soul cycle class while people are starving in africa
We love you Morgan 🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I dont give a fuck
Anyone heard of the memoirs of ww2 channel? My goodness, just watched a quick video about a navy guy. War is such mad chaos. That is sadness and I'm glad we aren't in any wars right now. Terrible. We are very privileged people.
Omg you should sell all this stuff you don't like on Poshmark or something
Why is this on trending. Is this person famous?
I wish things will get better from here on, and you'll accomplish the results you aspire, i wish that for you for me and for everyone who goes through same shit.. that's heavy and consuming.
When Morgan started crying, I started crying 😢
what? you looked amazing in those jeans. if it was me in those jeans id sceam yes bitch that aaassssasasasjgcahvoierhyv.qoryhglqiuregh... you get it you looked good morgan :)
Shaddup
Big hugs for you my sweet girl!
"Its not a breakdown, it's a breakthrough" is my new mantra
You were so happy in Colorado and that’s why this video made me feel so sad for you because we saw you come alive in Colorado, you deserve better so much better.
You get invited to dinner by your friends? Wow, I don't even get invited by my family for Easter, birthdays, and funerals... YOU feel empty? Wow.
be friends with sarah baska and caitlyn rae
Sending you all the love in the world

I relate to so much of this video. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety most of my life, and recently I’ve been struggling extra hard. And it’s to hard to stay hopeful when you’re doing all the things and it still feels like it’s not working. Thank you so much for sharing and being vulnerable and open about everything. It helps more than all the other healthy stuff I’ve been doing to try and make myself feel better 💞
You’re loved, cared about, & thought highly of by the right people. Don’t forget that. You’ll get through this tough time & fuckk that lady who calls other people bottom feeders lol. You know who you are 💖
I’ve been feeling a lot of the same things, but seeing this video really helps me know other people go through the same things- so thanks for being open about it because it helps more than you know💗
Morgan I’ve been there too! I related this video so much. I have felt that way so many days and nights. I still struggle with it from time to time. So proud of your growth!
this was the most real and relatable thing that i have ever seen online.
What you SHOULD do is capitalize on your pain and post it on YT.  That'll make it ALL better.
Praying for you girl!! I don’t know how religious you are but wherever I’m down I listen to the song Ocean from hillsong 💕
Every video of you I watch I'm just si convinced that you are neurodiverse in some way (autism and or adhd for instance). I recognize these struggles and this pain and I so wish you would have it checked out rather than scam brain scans that do nothing 🥺😅 I know you shouldnt armchair diagnose but please just look into it 💕💕💕
John 3:16-17 16- For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23- For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!
I would always watch your videos no matter where you live! I know exactly how you feel. I moved to a big city for like 6 months and I felt so down all the time because it just wasn't for me at all!
you said all of the things i couldn’t get out. my mom and friends don’t understand how rough it is and how alone we can still feel. no one understands why i am the way that i am sometimes. i’m so happy i am not alone, we will all get through this together. thank you morgan for always being open and honest❤️
Thank you so much for putting this out there bc I’ve been feeling so alone in this. I love you Morgan ❤️💓 you help people more than you know!
Omg the other day I also started crying while eating and trying to study 😂😭😂 I was like it’s fine everything’s fine as I kept eating and trying to focus
Literally 99% of you won’t see this but I hope everybody had a good day and God bless you
I got something that will make feel loved lon tine.
Relatable and real!❤️
I know how it feels that your life Is stagnante. Your not alone. I feel this way all the time. I hide how I really feel behind clothes and makeup. Nobody really understands until they go through it. I took the day off just to hide in my bedroom. Hang in there girl. You are amazing!!!!!
I teared up watching your video. You telling yourself that you were ok really hit me - I find myself repeating 'you're ok, you're ok' to myself often especially when I get an overwhelming rush of anxiety. You're not alone... Bad days will pass and good days will follow.
You aren’t alone!!! You make me feel better knowing someone with a platform is sharing exactly what I feel... I have an amazing life and I know but sometimes I do feel empty and my throat is closing. I truly have so much love for you Morgan❤️❤️❤️❤️
I don't have any friends
The end made my whole day.... Ugh
Smoke a joint. Thx 💕
the most relatable video ever.   the going out and keeping busy but never feeling fulfilled. then feeling bad about feeling the way you feel because you have your health, have a job and a roof over your head.  I feel you girl  if you find a cure please tell 🤣🤣
are you in therapy babe?
Ummmm... can we body swap? 😍
Thank you Morgan for sharing your inner thoughts  feelings to us. I can relate to all of the vudeo, especially towards the end of the video. I suffer from depression n PTSD and it's hard to relate to those that dont feel the same, especially siblings who can't relate. Keep smiling and take one day at a time, one moment at a time- it helps me get thru ❤
Kids in africa dont eat day to day no one cares ab your issues k have a good day
This video is going to help people more than you know. You're doing a hell of a job and remember you're still young. Growing up is hard and the friends who do stick around, especially during this time, will be friends with you forever. This too shall pass even though it hurts.
♥️
You are amazing and thank you for sharing this. I needed to know that I am not alone!
I feel this so deeply. I wish I had an answer for you. Sometimes I wonder if this is just how it is and there is no answer.
“I am simp nation” same sis
These type of videos will forever make no damn sense as if she owes us an explanation
morgan ur so strong. we love u. everything will be okay
Bottom feeder? Get up and walk out!! Never ever leave yourself in that situation. I argued my corner a bit one time, you know, don’t blanket judge everyone who’s mentally ill, when the YouTuber weighed in making excuses for me... No, nope, I’m done! You are loved, you are valued, and you are welcome 🙏🏽 xxj
I wish more people were open about our bad days, thank you for helping us not feel alone💜
When I am down I focus on what I still have that I find joy in... because we all have lost a lot this year. You can get through this, Morgan! We’re all much stronger than we know.
Talk to your family!..
I’ve never related to a video so much! I love you Morgan! We’ll get through it!
Leave LA
girl move to colorado, I have a gut feeling you will be so happy there. love u, thank you for being so honest with us.
Every time she mentions “bottom feeder” I think of the song by Parkway Drive
Thank you for being so open. We're all struggling right now and it's good to know we're not alone. Stay strong gorg! 💕 Better days are to come for us all!
Really love getting to see just Morgan being raw and talking about some real shit. Sending love
Go to counseling babe. Seek Gods guidance. Also if you are not on them consider antidepressants to get you through.
GIRL GET A ROOMMATE YOULL HAVE A FRIEND AND BE RICHER
Who else is super straight? ⬛🟧🙋‍♂️
Dear Morgan, you're not alone. We are all going through hard times and it's perfectly ok to not be ok, to cry, to feel lonely, to procrastinate so on so forth. You are beautiful, as a whole, both on the inside and outside 🤍🤗
you are such a cool person :)
You were so happy when you were home. Go back. Pack up. Go home
I totally relate!!! Waves of emotion it sucks!!! I am guilty of running from it all sometimes, but the universe has something its trying to convey!! We may not understand its plan for us but I hope you get yours. Keep shining Beautiful Morgan 😍 this video is everything!
this is so chaotic  **subscribes**
Yes girl! You looked so good in that red dress!😍😍
Honestly this is fantastic awareness for every day depression, which I very much appreciate <3
I love you sm❤
Please- write a book!!! I'm Serious.
I feel ur situation. kinda same as mine. try to believe that you are exactly where you are supposed to be. It's always a good time to have a good time. with friends and with out :):
Damn I felt this.....damn damn damn.... we're going to get through this y'all....really... breakdowns lead to breakthroughs
I fully feel you about the back row...and if some psycho was calling me a bottomfeeder, I'd silently be happy I had a mask covering my face, while really getting upset. Then I'd break down at home & then get mad at myself for all the things I should've said...😖  And the clothes....I feel that for real! And EVERYTHING you are saying about the past makes complete sense- you are more mature than most. I can't get rid of my old clothes!!!
you’re so strong for showing us this! it really does help to see others in the same situation, just know we’re here for you! 💗💗
10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. Work is for people who don't know how to fish. 2. If you don't like the news, go out and make some. 3. Give me ambiguity or give me something else. 4. We have enough youth. How about a fountain of "Smart"? 5. He who laughs last thinks slowest. 6. As long as there are tests, there will be prayer in public schools. 7. Laugh alone and the world thinks you're an idiot. 8. National Atheist's Day April 1st. 9. All generalizations are false. 10. Nothing is fool proof to a sufficiently talented fool.   Editorial:   Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.
"I look like the slug from Monsters Inc." Me, looking at my current glasses: "EXPOSED!" 😂
Never felt something so relatable, always thought I was alone. I litterily dont even know what I'm doing.
One thing that helps me, is to volunteer. Do something for someone else. Go to a food kitchen, habitat for humanity, anything that helps you to stop thinking about yourself & your life. I really recommend it! Take care ❤️
Bottom-feeders aside.. that cycling "instructor" is a psycho idiot. I would NEVER go to a class of any kind and expect or want at all for others to give their energy to me in such a weird way. GROSS. No thank you.   Rule of thumb.. if some rando person has the audacity to try and tell you who you are.. you're allowed to say no to that. Smh💀
Hey I feel you! I’m praying Jesus overwhelms you with His love! He fills my emptiness with unexplainable joy ❤️ I love you crazy girl! You’re so beautiful! 😍😍 Like wow!
all the jeans looked amazing on you!!! girl, I think you have a beautiful body!
Hang in there, you are strong you will get through this
Sending you lots of love. Let your sadness out now so you can free yourself up to feel new things later.
She is currently ME💚💚💚
This is so relatable!
Omg girl wtf are you crying about? You have everything, come and have a "life" in Latinoamérica so you can appreciate your life style.
morgan I really appreciate the transparency and realness of this video I relate so much to you and it’s so important to see that other people are going through similar things.
Thank you! I don’t feel alone
UGH 6:08 IS SO RELATABLE
Morgan you are so loved! Please know this when you are having your dark days. And please consider going to talk therapy if you aren’t already, I relate to some of the feelings and experiences you described and it help me a lot!! Again love you!!
Omg I resonated so much with this 😥 I fell in love 2 minutes in ❤
That dress looks amazing on you!!!! You are so beautiful 😍 you should wear red more often ❤️
Loll
Love this!!  So honest, so raw!!! Btw I’m from Vermont and would love to take some of those clothes off your hands!!!🤞🏽👍🏽 YOUR BEAUTIFUL 🤩
You showed up on trending and I'm so glad I'm here❤
I'm so sorry you feel this way and that it has tobe you who feels this way but just know that what you are going through so manny people do. Sadly this planet is not all fun and games . it can be for some people who don't care but those with a soul as beautiful as yours will always feel empty because they al wanting what is most important what others don't see and what others don't appreciate. But you make us better Morgan. you shine light on things that people should care more about. It's hard but listen to yourself go where it feels good be with the people who make you feel good. and leave the rest behind. Live life as you please don't try to fit in . you are not supposed to. society said that you need to life didn't choose life. 🥰. When you let these things go your life will flourish trust the process it's so worth it.
Thank you for being so real with us. It’s so hard in the world of social media to look at other people and compare about how good their life is, when in reality we all struggle. I wish everyone could be more honest and open instead of making their life seem so perfect. Maybe we would all understand each other better💕
Honestly, I couldn't relate more. Everything you said about mourning your life and trying to recreate it and just the whole video overal, is me. I have gone through this and will several more times in the near future. And said those exact things to myself. Thanks for sharing this with us and the world! I know im not alone, but this actually makes me feel not alone and like someone understands me. Thank you thank you thank you ❤❤❤❤
I relate to this so much. I had such a bad day/week/month but especially today and this helped. Thanks Morgan❤️
Omg MORGAN!!! I love u so so much and seeing u cry made me cry! We all go through it love! U are such a beautiful ray of sunshine and I just hope u know how loved u are! Whenever I am feeling this way there is one thing I always say to collect myself, it may not always work in the moment, but keeping it as a constant reminder to urself really made me stronger....you are braver than you believe, and stronger than you think...never forget how amazing u are😘
Sorry she is going through shit, but reading some of these responses makes me feel sad for the future of America.
Love you so much thank you for being so transparent and real ❤️ it’s so great to be able to see other people going through stuff and knowing none of us are alone
i’ll be your friend Morgan :)
don't be shy morgan..... what was the instructors name and location of soul cycle, I just wanna talk to her boss
Wow this might be the most relatable video ever. Sending lots of happy energy!
Thank you for sharing this <3 I feel your pain, and it helps a lot of people to know that they aren't alone.
Nice clickbait
It hurts seeing her like that , I know exactly how she feels . I love you Morgan
I’m so glad Morgan uploaded this. There is so many of us who are feeling so lost, alone, etc and it’s honestly a good reminder knowing others feel that way also. If anyone is struggling and reads this, know that you ARE loved, you ARE strong, and you ARE worthy of all the wonderful things life has to offer. Even if we’re strangers, we’re in this together and are here to support each other even if it’s via the internet and a simple like, comment, etc.
Morgan thank you so much for sharing this. It really helped me personally to see someone else have the exact same thoughts as me. This video made me laugh and cry and it was so touching. Also I do have to say you look absolutely stunning. Keep loving yourself, you deserve it.♡
Morgan go to holistic healing therapy !!!!
It's so weird how this video came at the most perfect time. My dog passed away in February and I've been super depressed. I feel like a failure because it took me so long to get out of my last depressive episode only to return to it. I feel like I'm letting people down. I appreciate this video so much, it means a lot to know I'm not the only one feeling this, even though it's not for the same reasons ❤❤❤
Happy Morgan, Confused about life Morgan,  either Morgan- I just wanna always give her hugs 🖤🤗   Morgan, please know you don’t have to be so hard on yourself. we all have times when we need to just cry or feel a bit down. like- that’s ok. and yes friends and life does continuously change. but please remember that YOU are such a sweet soul and so many of us love you just the way you are!!!
Get a peloton bike instead. Nobody will call you names in the comfort of your home.
I'm sorry you've been feeling this way but thank you so much for sharing this bcuz I have BEEN there. You're amazing and your growth is so awesome and inspiring. I'm so proud!!🥰
no one cares
Morgan you are so beautiful inside and out! Please know you’re not alone and this emptiness will not be an issue forever. Keep your head up. We all love you 💕
To be honest, I feel a lot of those  same feelings as you are right now. I have very few friends that I keep in touch with, I'm single and I'm currently unemployed, after 3 1/2 years of studying. It's hard and I feel for you <3 But you are not a bottom feeder, nor stupid, not in the slightest. You are an inspiration to me and so many others. I admire you for being a woman who is creative, spontaneous, kind, sets goals for herself and truly goes her own way - I think all of those things of you, from the bottom of my heart. Even on the days that you might not think so highly of yourself - just remember that there are people out there who do. Keep doing you and please don't feel any pressure to post when your mind just has to take a break. We will be here until you're healed and well.
Hey I know that this is a little strange but I live in the Central Valley and I just wanted to say if you want to get out of LA and explore other parts of CA make some new friends you could come stay with me for a little while or get a hotel and I could show you what we do around here, I’m 21 and I just wanted to offer I know it’s a long shot lol
I honestly believe you want to live in Colorado! But you feel guilty leaving Ryan. He will be ok! He has lots of friends. He’s just selfish and wants everything his way! Plus I’m sure you like parts of LA but you love Colorado! You can always visit and stay with Ryan! They have a huge house!! Love you girl and your videos!
Thank you Morgan.  I had a good cry with you, and I think I really needed it.
#womenmomement recording yourself crying, making it genuine asf.”
Sister, your meds need to be recalibrated. If the recalibration doesn’t help; would also really consider moving back to Colorado.   Prayers for you.
I Love you Morgan
I’ll be ur friend 💖
We stan a relatable queen <3
I think its funny that both Morgan and Ryland started "vlog" channels to hide from the scandals.
That little rant you about how even when you’re doing all the right things not isolating and you know you’re better than you’ve been in the past but you still just feel empty all the time hit me SO hard, literally made me cry lol ✨🤙 anyway that outfit was super cute
I relate to you on so many levels. I wish we were friends so we could get through these times together 🥴
haha
EVERYTHING YOU PUT ON YOU LOOKED SO GOOD IN EVERY OUTFIT JEAN GLASSES YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL!!
Maybe getting a room mate would help u. I mean u seem to need some one that's positive and loving around u all the time
Awww no, I hate how much other people’s mistakes are effecting you & your mental health. I hope people can learn to accept that you’re an entirely separate person.
I wish we could be friends morgan you are such a pure soul!
*Nobody cares*
My friend just passed yesterday by suicide & you explaining how dark things are really help me to understand what she may have been going through. It’s helped me take steps to forgiving her. Thank you for being authentically raw. A simple video can help the unexpected.
Morgan I feel like someone needs to tell you it’s okay the feel this way. You don’t have to fix it. I think if you accept these feelings when you are alone you will feel happier. Learn how to accept your emotions when you feel them not force them back down further and further.
Holy crap those DC shoes bring back memories!!!!!
Hey Morg, I know you’ve experimented with crystals and stuff before, but I’d recommend looking into your need and emptiness for God. Religion/God helped and completed me when I felt the way that you feel. ❤️
most relatable person on the internet periodt.
I wouldn’t want to yell either cuz I get shy too but I also have asthma & if I’m doing cardio I’d rather breathe then make noise for no reason.
You are not alone, Morgan. We all love you.
BTW.. cleaning in the middle of a mental breakdown is BEYOND relatable.
Cheer up girl! You are a beautiful soul :) Love your personality an over all vibe .. you're my type of ppl ;) Hope to see more vlogs!
You've said "you are not alone" so many times in this video. You aren't either, Morgan. I'm sure you know that because you show a lot of awareness of your feelings and I admire that so much. You're my little sisters age and it makes me so sad to see you go through these things. I'm just a stranger saying this but I'm proud of you and I'm positive you have many people in your actual life who are too. Stay strong, girl. YOU are not alone. <3
Morgan, you are so smart and capable and sometimes we forget that, you will get through this 💓 sending you love always
I completely understand Morgan thank you for speaking up for mental health 🙏 just know you are not alone .
If you're out here calling people bottom feeders, newsflash, you're talking about yourself. Im sorry that someone made you feel low like that. You're amazing.
Morgan your stunning !!!!!!!! Remember every morning when you open your eyes take 3 breaths
Its all a mindset
Hi morgan how are you
Hugs
Morgan, you can get through this.  I've felt much the same way lately, I wish I could give you a hug!
Your such a wonderful woman. Hugs hugs it sorta makes me sad to see someone I see as a friend hurting inside. Struggling to be ok  and it's ok to not be ok.mm I wish I could give u a good hug in person. Thank you Morgan for the bravery it took to hit that upload button and let us in in such a vulnerable and personal situation. Lots of love and support from LEECH LAKE reservation in northern MN.
WOW you said everything that I feel now too.... my life should be perfect right now, engaged, wedding booked and ready. I feel fucked up, depressed and empty.
Get a puppy.
I see positive action/inaction as positive affirmation, and negative action/inaction as negative affirmation, and see these as absolutely meaningful, which keeps me in a self-improvement behavior loop and gives my life meaning even in total solitude.  My two cents.
WHO R U GET OUT OF MY REMMOTIONS NOTMIEEEEE REEEEE
This is so relatable. Love you Morgan! 🤍
Thank you for daring to be vulnerable ❤️ please take care Morgan. Remember that you are loved ❤️
As a 24 year old I can relate to this so much
Much like with garret posted one every couple of months, I will always come back to watch you videos, to laugh, to relate, and to wish that you and me were legit friends irl. You are me, i am you, we have the same energy. I had a mental breakdown and gave myself a hot pink mohawk and then felt better. Just pure chaotic existential crisis but also hyper aware of it and spiraling because wtf do you do but just live through it. GIRL WE NEED TO BE FRIENDS! 🙃✌🏻
I want us to be best friends. Come to Spain for a holiday, I will put you up, and take yo on trips, and we will have drinks and cry on my balcony, and eat lots of yummy Mediterranean food.
Morgan I think you are happier being with you family. But that's an outsiders perspective from what you show
Aw baby girl :( Age 20-23 was the hardest point in my life, trying to redirect my life focus and decide what life was best for me. But I guarantee you will feel better, and that the world is saving up all its good for you. Sometimes you gotta get through some hard shit to be able to appreciate the good shit. Stay strong honeybee <3
Girl, your heart and soul is trying to tell your brain you’re not happy where you are. It okay to go back to CO. Living and being near and with family is OKAY. Be where your soul thrives and is happy. Take it from a much older person who has been through it. What makes you feel happy, is the direction your soul is pulling.
Nice tear wipe in thumbnail bait
You don’t have to have a reason to feel those feelings. Your feelings are valid. Proud of you for talking about this.
Morgan you are so young and so kind and much more beautiful than you believe inside and out. I know this may sound cliche but maybe if you involve yourself with something you are passionate about volunteering can give you such a great sense of purpose. You like to decorate, maybe habitat for humanity? Sharing your passion with others can be so fulfilling while also helping others 😊
Thank you Morgan. I so appreciate you sharing this message. I feel like this is me all the time... I go through ups and downs so much but my downs are very low. I loved your video. Such an important message.
I honestly forgot i was watching a YouTube video and felt like I was talking to a friend. Thank you for being so vulnerable Morgan ❤️ I know you’re going to look back at this one day and be so proud of who and what you’ve become. Much love my friend 💕
Please don't try to compare yourself to others. You are one of a kind and that is good.
please move out of LA and live your country girl farm wife dreams MORGAN
You're at home, why not just drink tap water? Why bring more trash and plastic into the equation? Even boxed water has a plastic coating.
We fucking love you Morgan omg. This video made me cry for the same reasons. As you’re talking it’s as my thoughts are speaking out loud.
If it makes you feel any better, none of us are doing ok right now
omg red is ur color u are so pretty ❤️❤️
Eggs
it'll all be ok in the end Morgan <3
“Mourning the life that i used to have and the friends that i used to have” omg morgan i am going through the same exact thing. I just moved from FL to raleigh NC, grew up in fl my whole life had a few good friends and a bf (now ex bf), over the last three months i got a new car, quit my job of 9 years and am now working from home doing something i have no experience in, and just found out last week my bf of four years has been cheating on me. So here i am, new state, new job, no bf and no friends all at 27. Starting over. I know how you feel, i hope this is all for a greater reason. 🙏🏼❤️
I'm so proud of you morgan!!! I know the feeling of crying just to get your feet on the floor, because it seems like your body believe that it will break with the impact. You're very strong, beautiful and a wonderful person. This video motivated me a lot ❤ Let's keep doing our best even in the hard times!!
Here’s to everyone who is currently struggling or has felt this way before. May we all work through it ❤️
Everything’s gonna be ok Morgan! LA sucks anyway so many fake people and judgmental 24/7 - traffic sucks , the air sucks. People there are can be draining and two faced! Sometimes not all friendships last- it may just be a friend for that time in ur life—Breaking through some friendships is a sign you are growing and to surround yourself with people who support you and are genuine to you!
I love Morgan "I'm a Back Row Bitch" lol 🤣😂
WOW!!! I don’t care
Am I missing something...Or what happened to Garret and Andrew? They seem like they would be great friends to lean on during this time.
This brings me back to the times I hit rock bottom with my depression ESPECIALLY after break ups. Maybe it’s time to go back home to your parents and seek professional help. Please take care of yourself 🤍
Please Morgan seek and stay with therapy. Your a great human just needs to get some help with leaving past where it belongs.
this was actually really therapeutic..thank you <3
this is so relatable, i have so much love for you! thank you for being so transparent, i really appreciate this
I have never related to something more
The part about trying to be a good person and feeling like it isn’t working I felt 😪😪but I’m sure it’s just in our head ❤️ because I think you’re a great human 🥰
"Self Growth is a beautiful thing:"-Morgan 2020 As she throws a way a dead plant.    Sometimes to grow you got to let go.
Ok Morgan you make so much sense and literally how I've been feeling the past year and the last few months especially. just know that you are not alone at all in the world.
16:59 how my job makes me feel.. wish I could have more control in my life then being stuck to a 7-5 job because I’m scared I won’t survive without it.
I've never related to a vlog so much in my life.
I know I'm just a random person on the internet and we don't actually know each other, but when I first saw you in one of Shane's videos I loved your personality and I followed you as soon as you made this channel. I still adore your personality and I think you'd make a great friend to anyone! I can only imagine how hard it is to live life on social media and to also live in a place that seems like you're being judged on everything you say and do. Just know that not everyone in the world is going to like you but there are plenty of people in the world that do and will like you for just being you. Just try to remember that you can't please everyone but don't let that dull your shine! You seem like a beautiful person and I hope the best for you and your life. <3
*TRANSFORMATIVE HEARTACHE* 💛
Morgan, I love how real you are. Your video has made me want to face life head on. Keep doing what your doing everything works out in the end I no how you feel. Lots of love x
Why is this exactly what I’ve been going through... every time you post ups and downs I’m in the same place in my life... scary
I'm going through the same thing. Never happy always feel like something is missing. It's alot. But we are all here for you girl! Love you.
"Everything is okay" *cries into her scrabled eggs*
Girl, you’ve got this! I’ve been feeling the exact same way recently, and if I’ve learned anything it’s that this was meant to happen. You aren’t alone and YOU CAN DO IT! Sending you my love <3
i can definitely relate to this, you honestly don’t know how beautiful this video was, keep being you dude, you got this in the bagggg, love you ♥️
Well, this title explains my situation right now.
I know you’re in a better state of mind, but you’re 100% not alone. Taking each battle on one by one is the only way you’re going to get past it. Don’t let anyone else determine what your journey is and how it’s going to go or how long it’s gonna take. But truly listen to the words when you say that if something doesn’t change it’s only gonna get worse. I’m only preaching the words that I’ve told myself time and time again for the last two years, and only just the last few weeks have I finally felt the progress from all that effort. And even though the progress is so small I’m sooo grateful!!!
this made me feel so much better. you are such a sweet person. i hope things keep getting better for you! i couldn't stop laughing at the DC shoes they are literal MOCCASSINS HAHAAHDRGHIU love you morgan
You are the REALEST person on Youtube ♡
I can relate fam🖤💚
Morgan you are such a sweet sensitive soul....you will get though this way you are feeling.You are loved  by your friends,family and fans x
Morgan u r so GORGEOUS  and one of the pure people on youtube. Stay strong beautiful.
Sending love. If no one has told you today, let me be the 1st. Y'all are AHHMAZING ♡♡♡
Awww Morgan 🥺🥺 virtual hugs 🤗 super clique but this too shall pass.
Give them signals like: “UUWW”
You really are doing a good job keeping it together. Hope it gets better cause same
Moooood im just as sensitive I’m so glad I’m not alone I feel crazy
Morgan ur literally me
Sensitivity = Poverty
🤍🤍 maybe I’m not alone 🙏🏻🥲
Maybe you should try getting close to God.
I’m so sorry you’re going through such a difficult time. Just know you are beautiful inside and out and you spend your days brightening others’ by making us all laugh and feel like we’re not alone. Hoping things can get a little easier for you soon Morgan ❤️❤️❤️
red is definitely your color 😍
If your having issues you should probably talk to a real person not a fking camera. "I'm feeling sorry for myself, give me attention".
So sorry your going through it Morgan. Sending you love and good energy. ✨
I wanna give you a hug so bad 🥺
I’m literally feeling exactly like you are. I’m struggling with you with losing old friends, always trying to be a good person, but yet I’m sad everyday
Hi Morgan !! Love your channel ... so relatable right now .. I’ve been trying to get myself together for a couple years now and it’s still a struggle 🤦🏼‍♀️ ( if only there was a pulling out my hair emoji)
everything you’ve said in this video, i was sitting there astounded because i’m going through the exact same thing. change is so hard especially when you’re an anxious person. i’m going through it too so i understand how you feel. i feel like i get so used to a situation, a person, a feeling and once something changes, it scares me. so many people say that sometimes change is good. i believe it but it’s adapting to the change that’s the hardest. you looked absolutely stunning in that red dress btw :)♥️
Morgan you are not alone. This is very similar to what I’ve been going through for the last 6 years and we’re in a similar place. You are going to get through this ❤️
You my dear, have no idea how many people you have touched. ( with honesty)
She’s always trending now a days. And is because it’s so relatable
This is something that I need and it's like this is exactly what it feels like when things are going on and you just don't feel right. I totally understand the whole happy to hang out with people, but then it's like some part of you just wants to be in bed, doing nothing. But it gets worse when you go home after hanging out with your friends because then you are alone again.
I think you should move back home and get an apartment near your parents! Your mom is your best friend and I think you need her and your grandma! ❤️
:( she’s like a casualty to all the dumb fucking drama
This video has been my literal mood for past couple of months but “it’s fine”😂
The entire point of life: Jesus did not come to be served, but to serve. Mathew 20: 28. We are no different. This entire life is a representation of the spiritual warfare going on. Good vs evil. God isn't a flying man in the sky, but the actual representation of Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Light, etc. Not metaphor, but literally, like an extra demintional wavelength of thought, emotions, and intent. The devil is the opposite wavelength, pain, fear, hate, anger, darkness, etc. Human life is serving one of these two. Not a man in the sky, actual sentient collective universal Love. However, humans are primatives, we make mistakes. It's in our nature, since the fall, to go down the wrong path. This means at some time each one of us has served darkness to some degree. God understands our limited understanding of our own actions, so he gave us forgiveness, though sacrificing himself in human form as Jesus Christ. It is our duty to accept that sacrifice, get the forgiveness, and be better, helping others be better, and spreading this wavelength of Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Light, etc, thoughout the universe. But God had to make a way for us to get to this place spiritually, this is why evidence is not allowed. Evidence will make you believe, using the fear of absolute punishment to change your behavior, but that won't make you better, just scared. Faith makes you better. It is what redeemes us, not our works. Faith is the hope that things get better, that justice always prevails, that we're at least loved by our creator. But it has to be Faith in Jesus, because of his sacrifice. And there can't be evidence to point us to him, because Love had to be fair. If there were a code in our DNA, what about everyone born before genetic sequencing? If there were a book with the solar system thosands of years ago, what would stop an evil person from hiding/destroying it? If it were something you had to go to, what about the geographically isolated, imprisoned, or enslaved. If it were a train of logic, what about the uneducated, or mentally slow? Not to mention all the people born before schools. Love cannot give to one without giving to the other. So the key to salvation had to be something everyone has access to. The only thing is Faith. This is why God puts it upon your heart to learn about these things, even if it's only to criticize, or hate. God is everywhere, because Love is everywhere, and so is the devil, because hate is everywhere. They're in your head all the time, regardless of weather or not you accept that. They whisper inside your heart, giving you ideas. But more than that, they're inside everyone's heart. This is how they get things done. They corrordanate us like pieces on a chess board. The only difference is, we get to chose who's side we're playing for. At the end of our life, we go to that team's home base, Heaven, or Hell. A place where all that exists is those wavelengths. Hate, pain, anger, fear, darkness; or Love, Hope, Joy, Peace, Pleasure, Light. The choice is yours to make. But you cannot go to Heaven with hate in your heart. You must forgive, repent, and spread joy for those around you. These are sentient eternal controlling forces in our universe. Heaven and Hell are very real places, I've seen them. Those steps prime your soul for a meeting with God. Very literally. Once you've done all four, in that order, you get divine revelation, with all the evidence you'll ever need. They are, forgive your parents, break down before Jesus, ask for forgiveness, and read the Bible. Step four takes three books to get the revelation. I recommend Genesis, Mathew, and then either Luke, Psalms, or proverbs. The order of the steps is important, step 1 has to come before step 3. I can state that for an absolute certainty that these steps always work. Please, take your salvation seriously. See for yourself. Do those steps. Jesus Christ is Lord. It's all True.
daily affirmations very morning, my therapist told me to reset the body by breathing or other grounding techniques it would help with those anxiety attacks. your body feeling heavy and weird is something your brain made your body to react to those triggers even small ones. next time you notice you feel that heaviness just take deep breaths like 874 technique is usefull or just deep breaths through nose 10 second in holding it for 5 seconds 10 seconds blowing out the mouth it might help to reset that bad body feling
I undertstand and currently relate to everything you said in this video. Especially the shot when you were wearing the red dress. You will probably never see this but in the chance you do , I have watched you grow and blossom in someone so beautiful. Your progress is truly inspiring. Most importantly, you are not alone. I love you so much Morgan, keep shining 💖
I relate to this vlog so much! Thank you for posting something real.
I feel your feels. Its been rough.
Not me crying with Morgan when she’s repeating it’s ok 😞 ..
*As if her first WORLD PROBLEMS ARE THAT BAD..*
What a raw video ❤️❤️ I feel all these same feelings you do. It's such a tough battle daily. Love you so much. You're amazing
Morgan we love watching you because you aren’t like the other youtubers.  If you were, I honestly wouldn’t watch. We like you because of who you are.
I need you to go back and rewatch your self when you were in Colorado.
Girl make a dpop
Morgan that Red Dress looks so great on you!❤🤍
Crocodile tears lol
Sounds like the exercise is meant to make people break down to the point we all become this one mind.
Anyone else feel like Morgan looks absolutely stunning in everything she has just tried on?! 🙋🏽‍♀️
Awe sweetie you are definitely not alone. I’ve been depressed since I was a teenager and now my 19yr old daughter gets very depressed to. I’ve tried so hard to help her but nothing I do can get her out of her funk. So I sympathize with you 100%. You need to go home that’s obviously where you’re the happiest. You do what makes you happy sweetheart. Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day for you. I definitely will keep you in my prayers☺️😊
This is one of the best YouTube videos I have ever watched, I’m only 2 years older and you nailed something real here, Thank you!
I wish i could give you a good hug rn Morgan <3 I'm feeling it too, i feel empty, burdened. No energy, unmotivated... I think we're all very affected by Covid, we don't even have the disease but its like... Idk its just fucked up. I watchh all thhese other people not giving a fuck about it, makes me more sad.  Anyway as always, it does get better. And pls talk to someone about this?
related too this entire video too much. thank you for being so open and being brave enough to put this out there. it feels so good to know that we’re not alone.
It truly hurts me so much to see you going through this. I obviously don’t know you but I can see how sad and how much you’re struggling. Social media these days paints such unrealistic pictures. Know you are not alone, Morgan. Know that you are helping people by talking about your struggles. ♥️
I feel exactly like how you feel right now with my life. I’m spiraling then fine and spiraling again.
Thank you for this wonderful video. It was the most genuine thing i have seen on youtube. I believe your content will really help people with mental health issues since it did for me. Morgan, i hope you always remember that you are beautiful and strong.
16:30 describes how I’m feeling exactly. I’m in my late twenties, and have done a  LOT of work in my mental health in the last decade. All the things I usually do to pull myself out of a depression (or at least keep it from getting really bad) have not been working. I think COVID is part of that maybe? Idk. Just know this video helped me today. I’m going to go through my closet rn. Been putting it off.
🐈‍⬛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💓
I wish you all the best.  I’m feeling quite literally the same way and have for the past 5 years.  You deserve happiness!
you are literally gorgeous omg 😍
im 8min into the vid. If you wanna make friends, you should try to play videogames. It's p easy to get new friends while playing Phasmophobia, and its not a game u need to "be good at" to have fun! <33
Ohhh Morgan, I would like to be your friend ❤️ I just moved to the US, but I'm living in Houston. I wish you all the best, your life is just starting ✨ better things will come.
So very relatable. But girl YOUR BOOTY THOUGH!!! ❤️🍑 love u
Morgan we all love you and care about you.  You are a good person and you have helped so many of us me included so don’t be so hard on yourself.  I hope you stay healthy physically and mentally and I hope that you have a happy and good year❤️
You really are the one relatable person I have come across on YouTube. I’m happy that you’re finding your peace 💜🥺
I'm gonna be honest. I started watching this as background noise while I was cleaning half my house for the first time in a while and I didnt realise the video stopped so now I'm rewatching it while having a lunch break from cleaning and this is really great to listen to today 💛💚
I cried with you. It sucks to feel this way. It's so hard to describe it.
Girl, this video is literally what I’m going through right now! Love that you are so real!!
Ugh I want to be Morgan’s friend so bad. I feel like we’ve had the same struggles and she is just such a sweet & wholesome person & I just want to give her the love she deserves
I watched this feeling like shit and started crying with you thanks
Your really pretty
Morgan, hold onto what’s good💛 and stop calling yourself stupid because you’re not. LOVE yourself, accept yourself.
But aleast I'm gonna look cute doing it
It’s ok to feel how you are feeling. Is a struggle daily. I go to work and all I want to do is hide under my cover and cry. But we can’t! We need to go out and face these demons .hugs ❤️❤️❤️
Very relatable ❤
You look like blonde khloe kardashian👌🏼👌🏼
I love u xoxo
I felt this whole video! I have been going through the same thing recently. ♥️♥️ It will get better
I went from the Appalachian mountains to the city and I feel the exact same way. The people here are different. I have no friends because of it. Your environment and surrounding is what supports you. It’s hard to feel that in a city. It’s a place for people with different intentions. I hope you find your happy place ♥️
I was a fan of cycling classes in college that were outside of SoulCycle. I tried one class and as soon as the instructor said “keep working hard so you can earn that burger and fries you want” I almost walked out right then and there. SoulCycle ain’t IT FAM 🤨🤨
I adore you Morgan ❤️❤️ thank you for being open and honest with us all 💓💓  you probably won't see this but know that you are loved and you are beautiful
Call me crazy..but maybe you have a bad spirit attaching itself to you in that apartment. When you were discussing going to your friends birthday, I swear I saw something move behind you..and it dawned on me. You've said you're sensitive to that stuff before..might be something to consider. Sending you love, we're here with you hun. 💗
I just have to say thank you, there are so many of us that feel weird leaving comments like meintertwined
Mount clotherus 😂😂
God I relate to every word so hard. You’re not alone in this space... so many of us are there too. We need to keep moving. One foot in front of the other.
I was going to say, are you going through a break up? Because I feel like idk anything that is going on anymore and it sure felt like one. Then I see the end of the video.
Girl I’ll be your friend 🥺🥺🥺 it’s a real struggle trying to meet people these days.
Morgan, honey, growth naturally comes with growing pains. Be kind to yourself and patient...masterpieces take time, talent, and passion. You’ve got what it takes, and you’re doing the work. It’s a process and you’re growing into you perfectly.  Keep going!! Sending lots of love and keeping you in my prayers. I can’t speak for everyone but I can say I personally love the real content you’re serving this year. You’re NEVER alone, and damn straight it’s hard out in these streets. PS~try another plant, research what they need (light conditions in your specific space) and find a plant that thrives in those conditions. Flowering plants are a joy to grow. Or maybe start a garden? I’m here for a patio makeover if you’re needing content ideas. Being alone in the still darkness is always where my loudest intrusive thoughts thrive. But, laying there admiring a space you intentionally beautified will help keep the thoughts positive and the same for waking up. Positive vibes are naturally energizing...girl beautify that patio🙏🏻😍
hey are you on a diet? you look like you lost some weight 🤔
Morgan I feel all the things you are feeling. This year has been honestly kind of depressing for me. I am usually a really happy person and recently I have been feeling the loneliness and lack of great friends. I just want people to care as much as I do and honestly that’s just not the point of life I am in. So if you are feeling alone in this you aren’t. I always love watching you and get excited to see whenever your upload. I truly don’t care if it’s happy or sad I just relate to you. I came off a high of seeing my family this weekend and came back to my apartment at school and feel lonely again. I am a senior in college and just too many things are putting pressure on what I am supposed to be doing. Love you and keep going because it’s just a bad week and crying is okay.
I am a bottom feeder who doesn’t even exercise.
morgan! you were on my mind and you may never see this, but im throwing it out into the universe anyway! you don’t know it, but we are literally the same person! we have the same birthday same year and when i watch your vlogs its so crazy how much we have in common personality wise. you are doing so great, i know life seems hard at times but its in those moments where we can learn about ourselves and grow 😌 never be afraid of the sunsetting, being alone, or anything! fear holds us back, and god has an amazing plan for your life! you will find your home & your tribe, just keep living, following your heart, and being awesome! the world needs to see more of people like you ☀️
Ommmg I have that exact sweater love that
morton, i love you.
You're not alone Morgan! you are a ray of sunshine, and reality all at once. Don't change, and get out of LA, you're too wholesome and genuine. xoxo
Morgan you are not alone. I go through the same periods of emptiness and hopelessness for no good reason. I have a great man in my life, a great career, my health and my family and yet I still find reasons to be sad, hurt, and empty. I relate to you so much and I just want you to know that this isn’t your fault, it’s the way our brains work. We have to work everyday to overcome it.
Im in the exact same head space as you. And you explained it so well. Thank you for sharing❤️
Morgan I was watching this on the way to a job interview and the guy showing me around was wearing DC shoes..... i think it’s a sign
Morgan I think that it isn’t the Universe that’s calling you or anything like that, I truly believe that this is a crucial time in your life that you are learning so much! These pains and sorrows are normal and I thank you for your bravery towards sharing raw and honest feelings to fans like me! ❤️ I feel that God and Jesus is trying to tell me that he is with you through everything you are going through and that he is calling you to start praying and gaining that awesome relationship with him, he’s also is telling me to remind you that no matter what you do in this world, the world will never truly fill you with the people and the money and the locations you are in and etc. God, is the only source to truly filling us up and filling that empty hole inside. I once felt that same way as you explained in the video, but once I began building that relationship with God, I was SO filled with love, purpose, happiness, being content and feeling in a place that I feel so confident in myself and where I am no matter what situation I am in. This world will tell us that we are here because of an accidental explosion and that we have no purpose and tries to convince us that there is no creator to creation. This life is so beautiful and truly has so much intelligence. It’s evident! God tells us we are so worthy, significantly important and we all have purpose. He felt so much joy about the mere thought of you that he decided tho create you and give you the gift of life to fulfill purpose to spread love on this earth. He will give you life, purpose and trust me when I tell you that he will change your life for the better and teach you how to truly fall in love with yourself and how to love others❤️ How to forgive and how to let go and cast all anxieties and burdens onto him. I am a sinner, but the best part is that God is so loving that he says come as you are and he will start there with you, at whatever point or stage of your life you are in. Because he loves you so much. Much love to you Morgan❤️💯😘 This is my personal belief on how this world and life works and I truly believe this due to my own experiences with God. But listen my friend, I don’t want to force you in anyway towards God but I truly hope and encourage you to go to the Father, go to God! ❤️❤️❤️ He is waiting for you my sweet friend!!❤️❤️ Either way, I love you girl and your videos! I’ll be praying for your situation❤️❤️
I think you just need to move back home with your family... just spend some more time with them. Even get rid of your apartment there and if you ever wanna go back in a year or 2 then get a new place
Girl I was there at your age. IT GETS BETTER. Keep trying to find what you enjoy and keep getting out there <3
I have been living in such a gloom for a while now because of these exact reasons. I feel like I’m losing my friends and I feel alone. Even though I live with my family it’s still the same I don’t have anyone to talk to about things relevant to my age. I want to move somewhere where I can just really be me not have any baggage around me. But I can’t yet and it really sucks. Hang in there Morgan.
You need to live somewhere with a roommate you vibe with.  Adulting in an apartment by yourself can be freeing but it can also be isolating.
Girl literally i feel the same 🥺 every day but i think at some point it will get better, idk when but i have hope 🥺❤️
I’m really feeling this I have zero motivation this week to any of my assignments I want to be alone and not talk to anyone. April bringing in the weird vibes
I feel you ♥️
I hate that you’re going through this but I’m also going through this exact thing right now and it’s very comforting to know I’m not alone in these feelings.
I felt like this for a hot minute, so I moved back home. It helped. I miss my friends but having my family closer has helped.
Hey Morgan. I think somebody needs to tells you this. If you feel safe, sane, happy, supported, love, confident where your family is at (your parents, and grandma). Go back home. My favorite content is that with your parents and your grandma. If the pandemic has thought me, anything is that you can make it anywhere. I’m not sure if it’s applicable to you as a content creator but I do hope so. Don’t think that you are suppose to make it on your own. It’s okay to need people. It’s okay want a sense of community. Chose you, make yourself a priority. I been where you are and to be honest I’m still there too. I totally feel you. Just know you are loved. I’m here for you. Love you so much.
by far the most relatable video on youtube. thank you
Sending a big virtual hug right now!! Really just shows that everyone should be kind to one another because you have no idea what hurt someone is carrying! Btw You look Gorgeous in that red dress!! Love you Morgan and Thank you for sharing!
I can relate too much.
never related to a video more! <3
I felt this whole video
This vlog was needed
Morgan, I am feeling 100% the same as you right now. I have been struggling so hard and it's leading me to find any which way to make me feel sick and take me away from my reality. Every day I struggle with pulling through the rest of the day because I feel so heavy. Every day I consider taking pills and letting things slow down. Every day I see myself going further from the person I want myself to be which only pushes me further down. I don't know my place in this world and I don't know where I belong and I want nothing more than to find out but I am giving up on myself.  It's hard to care about someone you no longer feel you know. It's hard to care about someone when they've always let you down.
thank u so much for sharing, morgan <3 relatable as hell and just know that so much of us are there with you :') love u mom
Girl, get out of toxic L.A
I just don't understand why you want to remain in L.A.
gawwwwd I felt this whole video...thank u🥺
Proud bottom feeder 👋
I want a shirt that says back row bitch with a cycle
Virtual hugs to you! I can only imagine that all of us rooting for you from afar, doesn't hold the same weight as one on one relationships but you do have a lot of folks wanting nothing but the best for you. You can only live one day at a time which seems like a cliche, but, be in the moment and try to rest in the fact that you are enough. Again, hugs to you❤️
🖤🖤🖤
Hugsssss!
I just have to reasure you that you’re exactly where you need to be, feel the emotions, everything is unfolding and your future is manifesting by itself, the universe knows your deepest desires, it will be amazing in the end. You are trying so hard to figure everything out and solve your problems. We are humans, we will never know everything and have everything figured out. Only when you start letting go and starting to live one day at a time it will unfold one by one. This is a self note too, i feel so much for you because i seem to be almost the same person with a lot of the same struggles like you have. Praying for us 🙏🏼🥳🥺😩
It's called anxiety and depression. Your not alone believe me. I feel the same way all the time. You gonna find you a boo girl who's gonna love you unconditionally.... You are freaking hot girl... U need to throw yourself out there because your personality is awesome
Thank you for sharing this ❤️ going through a really tough time too and seeing this just reminds me it’ll all be okay in a few days
Relate
Girl I relate so much to this whole vlog. Thanks for posting it ❤️❤️
Are you considering moving? Or at least moving to a new area?? If you are, do it.
You have a heart of gold the way you managed to stay so positive about other peoples emotions when you are in such a dark moment was so magic. You are one of a kind. I have been watching you grow for a few years but this raw video was so emotional and relatable too thank you for being so vulnerable to help others feel comfort ♥️
morgan you are loved, you are so worthy and God has put you on this earth for a reason. remember just to pray when you are feeling like this. ask for strength and guidance. God bless much love!!💓 muahhh😚🥰
Morgan your so lucky you have people all over the world who love you just the way you are ❤️ your colombian friend from Florida sending you all the positive energy
I relate to this so hard
You need to move back to Colorado. You seem so happy there. I know your mom would love for you to be there. Roland can come visit you this time..
You are so strong for realizing that it’s okay to not be okay and showing others it’s okay. You aren’t alone and you are helping others to see they aren’t alone either🖤
Are you and trinity still bff's?
Going minimalist is very freeing, especially if you’re trying to figure stuff out!
Sending you LOVE AND POSITIVE ENERGY ❤❤❤❤❤🥰💜💙
We can relate 🙃
You look like you glowed up
The past few days I’ve felt so emotional and empty and then getting on here to see another relatable vlog by you. You have no idea the impact you make on others lives just by being you and sharing those struggles with others =] Keep you’re chin up lady. Thank you.
Thank you for sharing. Your not alone
thank you SO much for posting this, it's so comforting to watch something that doesn't make me feel more alone. recently i've started tellng myself that "everything i feel is happening TO me, is actually happening FOR me" and it's been helping. excited to see your next vlogs❤️
It breaks my heart to see this Morgan because I know exactly how you feel. It can be so lonely to have this deep sadness. We're all here for you! ❤
Morgan you’re a beautiful human being. I know me saying this doesn’t do anything because you don’t know me. But you help people more than you think. You’re an amazing person and being open and raw like this shows growth. I see a change in you and I’m proud of you. Everyone holds on to things hun, it’s normal. Just need to learn to let go of things to make room for new memories/experiences. Don’t hold yourself back and by you getting rid of your stuff shows you’re moving forward. I love you Morgan.   Also that red dress is absolutely beautiful!!!
I struggled with this my whole ass life, I don’t know why nobody ever diagnosed me with an anxiety disorder. Now that I’m older I look back at my mid-twenties self and I want to cry and hug me/her bc she was so anxious I/she couldn’t feel her life  Go as easy on yourself as you can, if you have to go thru the gigs at least you look great
Girl you need to read your bible more. You have no peace. Go read Jeremiah 29:11
This is a place that I can definitely relate to, especially within the last few weeks. Thank you for helping me feel less alone. 🥰
Morgan i love you omg. You are so iconic and strong. Please feel better. It's okay to not be okay. <3
I’ve always wanted to be your friend from the moment you were introduced to me You’re the first girl I could relate to on YouTube and you stayed true to yourself, and when I watch your videos I feel so safe and I just love your personality so much  You’re such a sweet, funny girl and deserve so much happiness Morgan ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for saying something, I’ve never been able to relate anyone the way I just did with everything you’ve said
I needed this video. Its so easy to feel like I’m the only one when I have moments of self doubt or confusion. I wish we could be friends in another universe because we literally have the same sick sense of humor. Always be yourself dude! I’m born in Colorado too, shout out 💃🙌
I’m so sorry you feel this way. I have bipolar depression and that’s exactly how it feels. You feel bad for being hopeless or sad. I’m so so sorry Morgan. You’re a great person.
Oh hunny you are not alone we are all going through it 💛❤
No matter how amazing your life is, depression can still happen. Don't feel guilty! We are going though a pandemic, life is really really hard.
You should move back to Colorado and be with your family, live there. Visit LA.
Same girl same.. we will get through this! ❤️
Girl move back to Colorado. You were so so happy there. LA is just toxic on so many levels. Love you girl!
I've been there , I am there . Plz get professional help.
I have felt like this so many times it’s stupid and it really made me feel where you’re coming from. I know it must be so hard to be in the spotlight and starting over at the same time. Just know that I support you and love your personality so freaking much! Keep your light and positivity and it will all come back to you. Good luck love keep it up 🧡
I love morgan so much
Does it correlate with your cycle at all? I spent years not understanding why I couldn't maintain a positive streak and it took me ages to realise that my run up to my period is like 8-10 days. I'm not too bad while I'm ON my period but hormones give me a final kick about 3 days after I come off it. I also can't take synthetic hormones coz they make me like that 29 out of 31 days xx
Yes yes yes!
I literally went through a time (literally last month) where I was going to study Psychology just because I was feeling so bad. Then I realized that I probably shouldn't be helping people if I can't even help myself😂 then I found brownies and I'm all better
This was a very powerful video. I share a lot of the same feelings and sentiments, so just know you’re not alone in what you’re going through
Glad I’m not the only one who cleans out their entire room when they are having a breakdown
I deal with Manic Depression and the highs are great and you feel like you are really going somewhere, and then the smallest thing chrashes you and you can't move. Its hard because  of the waves it comes in. I hope you can have a better time and you have more love.
I’m 25 and met this point at 22 and The de-clutter moment was me every day, but prayer and time w/ God really cut those tears down to size!! Life isn’t easy, but there’s ways to reinvent! But Morgan, you’re super smart and in touch so I’m sure you’ll get through !! This is that 20’s hurdle for surrreee we’re all gonna MAKE IT!  Thanks for sharing these vulnerable moments, we love you!
Sending you big love Morgan. Xo
Damn, when the clog hits you
You’re amazing Morgan.
Morgan eating her breakfast and aggressively repeating "everything is okay" while gradually beginning to sob is such a mood
SOOO RELATABLE the entire video 😔
Thank you for bringing light to a subject no one really talks about and being so vulnerable. I feel like this daily and it makes me feel less crazy that I’m not the only one that feels like this. I hope things get better and you have better days soon 💜
I'm struggling too. I see you and you're not alone <3
"if you feel like you're going to die and your life is being sucked away from you then just..... *✨wait a few days✨* " -morgans vlogs
You’re such a sweet beautiful soul
Morgan I hate that you feel like this just know that you’ve got so much people that love you all your subscribers and followers love you for who you are! I honestly wish I could be your friend I’m going to fly to America one day in hopes of meeting you one day also you look so hot with that red dress
This is literally me rn😭 sending you love❤️
We love you Morgan! Never forget to reflect and take control of yourself. You are a big inspiration to many. Keep your head held high and never forget you are loved, you are beautiful and you matter. Much love to my favorite YouTube queen. 🙏🏼❤️
Take care of yourself, love <3
I really needed this video today. I so appreciate you being vulnerable because I'm feeling a lot of what you're feeling at the current moment and it's nice to see someone put it into words and feel those things but reminding me that I'm gonna be okay. So thank you Morgan ♥️
Cookies meow makes everything better! 😻 Big hugs! We love you Morgan! I hope you’re having a better week.
I have days and weeks like this ! Way to often unfortunately . This is so relatable ! ... but you’re absolutely gorgeous inside and out . When I watch your videos they make me feel better but also not alone . I also know so many others feel the same . You’re a QUEEN !
I love you Morgan!!!!!!!
Soo amazing to not feel so alone 🖤 I hate that other people have to feel the way I feel but at the same time it helps so much to know I'm not alone 🖤  On another note, I need allllll those sunglasses 🕶😅🤙🙌
To be honest with you Morgan, I think that this answers your question about whether to stay in LA or go back to Colorado.  You were so happy in Colorado and thinking you might move back. A couple of weeks back in LA and you’re miserable again.  If I were you, I’d be moving back to Colorado... ASAP...
Ohhh🥺🥺🥺🥺I wish I could give you a hug  it was so heartbreaking... it will be ok Morgan I been like that too feeling lonely  with people  around me ... 😣😣
Sending you love Morgan. You make so many people happy with your beauty and humor. You are one of my favorites. Keep your head up and know everyone has bad times and bad days. Just please don’t let depression eat you up. Smile and talk to someone. 💕🥰💕🥰💕🥰💕
Red is your color I’m just sayin 🤷🏻‍♀️
This is the most relatable YouTube video I have ever seen. I hope you're okay Morgan. You deserve happiness ❤️
Love ya Morgan
You do have new friends everyone that is here supports you and wants to be here for you , stay strong your a great person xx
*you should move BACK to Colorado. you seem so depressed in LA*
Morgan we need a good crying session with each other cuz I feel you girl! 😭💕 I love ya! 😭💕
This just makes me feel like we're all apart of this collective group of "breakthrough time" 💕
Sending well wishes your way! its inspiring to see someone soldier on and keep it so real
I’m so depressed :’( I think we would be such good friends like I want to go to the drive in with ton and everything I’m so fun and funny when I want but yeah life so sad :((
I love you Morgan!
I've had depression for quite a while and I figured out a way for me to handle it, but then the new big C word came and took all of that from me. I was so unhappy with just everything in my life and changed it all, and finally found the one thing I want to do in life - have my own bar one day. But with all the lockdowns here I just can't progress it feels like. I can't gain any work experience, whatever experience I've had so far feels negligible cause I've been pushed from bartending into service again, and on top of that my boss is not paying my wages even though he's supposed to and I wasted all my savings by now just to stay afloat. It's like I'm losing my grip on things, I have no more control over anything, and I'm slowly but surely going insane. And whatever little thing I could have done up to this point, I can't now because everything's just absolutely paralysing. I'm honestly so glad that I have my parents to support me as much as they do, and that I feel comfortable now sharing my concerns with them, cause it wasn't always the case. After talking to them, I have an idea of what I can and should do now to solve at least one of my problems. And it feels like I can move towards my goal again, and not away from it, at least a tiny little bit. Maybe that's something that you haven't found for yourself yet? An ultimate goal to work towards, that has you getting up in the morning a lot easier? It's just something that really helps me a lot, but who knows...
Morgan I just want to say you are so brave for posting what your going through because unfortunately not enough people do this that's why everyone thinks other people's lives are perfect, thank you so much for sharing your felling with all of us because you are not alone, we love you girl ❤️
I feel for you. I really empathize and resonates with your feelings and words. I appreciate you being here and putting out this energy that you very clearly don’t feel on the i side. That’s difficult, but incredibly admirable. You are such a wonderful person and I hope you can give all your thoughts and feelings a place in your heart and grow from them❤️
wow i really felt that part about trying to hold on to what it was and mourning the life you had / thought you would have and not letting go :// it's hard
First off your ass is AMAZING in jeans ♥️♥️♥️ Second I get how your feeling but I'm also very proud of you that you find some better comforts when you're breaking down than what I do.........hang in there love eventually you will be ok ♥️ just keep reminding yourself how far you've come in life and how much farther you're gonna go you're strong
Trust me I’ve had several anxiety and panic attacks this week.  I totally understand how you’re feeling at least you’re looking beautiful doing it. Btw all those jeans looked really good in you.
Thank you for sharing this. I had a really hard week mentally too and sometimes it feels like nobody understands. This reminds me that there are people that feel how I feel and that we can lift each other up. I love you and hope you’re having a good day 💕
U crying and being able to acknowledge ur emotions n what u r feeling n expressing it is a form of self growth n finding out things of about urself. U r becoming self aware n its part of the healing process. U r doing amazing u r not alone keep up the great work.
I've been told that when people dedicate their time to helping others (pet rescue, soup kitchen, under privileged kids, whatever.) they are happier and are given a cause to fight for. I happen to agree because I help people and pets.
Praying for you Morgan🙏🏼❤️ you’ll get through this!❤️❤️
I can't find friends either 😂😂   Sorry your mental state is bad right now, but it sounds like LA may not be your happy place. If you are happier in Colorado... that’s where you need to be hun! 💜💜💜 it's okay to not know what you are doing with your life! You will find it eventually.
Oh Morgan, I hope you start to feel better soon and find that something you're missing!  Mental health can be such a bitch!! I'm not diagnosing, but for someone who lives with it, it sounds like you have depression. Everything can be amazing in life but you just feel so empty...  Also, do you feel more down around your period? I get very, very down when I'm due!! Your hormones might be up to shit too?  I'm just throwing ideas out there. And you most definitely are not alone❤️
i love you Morgan! Bitch you're amazing! You are one of the most inspirational people in my life! You are incredible, strong, smart, beautiful, kind, loving, caring and so sweet! You're going to get through this! You're a bad bleep! and you got this! You can handle anything! <3 Wishing you love, and peace
Love the rawness and realness morgan! we love you
Gurl you need Colorado!
Love you Morgan, stay strong girl!
So👏🏻relatable 👏🏻! There must have been some sort of moon in Gatorade because shit has felt so off lately! I was crying all the time too and it’s the worst feeling ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Proud of you for working through it you’re doing amazing ❤️❤️❤️ Loneliness and feeling detached from the world around you is truely one of the hardest things to deal with. 2020/2021 has hit us all so so hard xx
LA seems like the most toxic place on the planet. It’s no wonder genuine good people feel depressed there.
Never related to something so much in my life.
If you ever want to move to Australia we can be best friends x you’ve got this
I think you have existential loneliness
Girl we get it my sweet 🤍 I know I’m definitely feeling down and I’m almost always happy and positive. Totally done with life right now lol so I think we all need a mental break 😘  I also think that one thing that I was never taught and idk about anyone else.. but I think it’s extremely important to tell your children that they are deserving and if they aren’t at times, then be someone who is deserving.
Excuse me but who is this beauuuuty in 15:00 😍
You’re perfect the way you are already and however you show up is fine, even if you’re a bottom feeder lol
I never thought I would relate to morgan at this point
Gurl tour an amazing strong woman u got this u got me through so much u got support 100 percent
Thank GOD there’s someone like you to make me feel like I’m not alone, i very much appreciated you being transparent during a semi breakdown, I needed this today, thank you Morgan 👏🏻
OMG, anyone know where I can find the water thing inside Morgans fridge? Never seen that before.. but need it in my life 😍
Morgan I am so sorry you feel this way, you’re an amazing person and anyone would be happy to be your friend! But honestly, I think the universe is telling you to go back to Colorado and visit your actual friends who already appreciate you and have been for years ❤️
This was litterly my last 10 weeks
Should I put tiki torches in my room to feel something 😂😂😂 why is that me!!
Morgan, I am sorry you are feeling this way. I have been depressed lately and had to drop a program I worked so hard for. Let’s be friends even if it is only online. You got this girl. Much love to you, positive energy, and joy. You got this.
I love you Morgan, your beautiful, You're too hard on yourself. 💘💘💘❣ sending lots of love and prayers
if this ain’t me ....god damn girl i feel ya
I think you just need to full on mourn your old life. It’s not fair, and life isn’t fair.
She needs someone close to her that loves her and cuddles. Come on boys shes amazing, missing ur shot😑
You are so pretty omg
Same. Just same. 💗
🥰🥰🥰
Stop reading my diary Morgan! Did u hack my diary app?? Lolz..... legit though..  hmmm ? Sending u my love from Queensland Australia 💯❤😘✌🇦🇺
Lol  "I'm just feeling very toxic"  Honestly same 🤣🥴☠️
Sweet angel I'm 37 years old with two kids and still feeling like this a lot of times.  You are too good and emotional for this world 😔
it's okay I'm a back corner bitch too  I feel like we would make great friends 💁‍♀️
Morgan, you’re such a beautiful person inside and out. Thank you for sharing this, I know so many of us needed it. We all love you so much
quarter life crisis sucks. I love my family, friends my hometown, my country but I think its sucks to be here and I can't wait to get out from where I am right now and just go somewhere that no one knows me and just live independently. Sometime we just need intervention in our life and try new stuff that interest us and always remember that we're still young and whatever is happening right is not the end.
I think you look amazing in jeans and you don't have a "big ass." Embrace your figure what I tell myself is "I don't want to be real skinny. Because if a gust of wind comes I'll blow away." Morgan your beautiful and amazingly gentle soul, please don't change who you are girl you got this ❤ Like the end of your video just get laughing it helps the healing process. Sorry this is so long stay blessed and safe.
Sending love and healing but I would complain about her.she has no right to say that to anyone.  Putting people down when there going to work out makes you a b**** and not a safe place to go.
omg you're so beautiful <3
“Hey bestie”  Me literally talking to any inanimate thing
Morgan, if you only knew  that we would watch your vlogs if you  were just venting like you did in this vlog. I feel like I’m face timing with a friend, a friend that by no means is a bottom feeder! You are so pretty, inside and out. I will remember you in my prayers, k? XO 🥰
i love you so much morgan pls :((
you’re not alone ❤️❤️
Same last week was bad for me I broke my foot and have been on crutches since lol
🖤
I feel you🙊! Radical scary changes will do good but it has to be good radical change mentally. You know what I'm saying😂 💕
She needs to be on meds and seeing a counselor I know she doesn't like meds but clearly this is a chemical imbalance going on... When you get the right meds they help a lot
Drinks tea yet advertises Flow water 🤣
I can't even explain or put that into words how much I can relate to this. To whoever reading this *a big virtual hug to you* and as morgan says, its just a bad day and not a bad life!! <3
Ooooh Morgan the way I relate to you! I have been going through it these past few weeks too! And it gets soooo tiring and exhausting!
I really feel this vid.. I'm nearly 29 and I'm only just trying to figure out life shit and trying to move on from past things. I hope you are okay! You're cool as fuck and deserve the best xxx
The sting. I relate to that so deeply. You are not alone my dear. I promise. We love you so so much, no matter what. What you're going through isn't easy, but I am so proud of you for not giving up. Keep going. Love yourself. Choose love. Always. You are so beautiful inside and out, good luck Morgan & Blessed Be. ❤
it broke my heart when she kept telling herself that she’s okay while trying not to cry:( this sounds cliche but please always remember that it’s okay not to be okay n you’re allowed to cry, honestly crying is a good thing and we’re always there for you !! you’re one of the realest influencers i know. we love you you’re not alone 🤍
feel better 💙
Honestly I love Morgan's fashion style like I love all of her outfits 😁
When you get your period next week and everything makes sense... 💜
i’m currently going through a really similar situation and i’ve finally come to terms with how much happier i am when i’m at my family’s home rather than in my own apartment by myself. i moved to the city where i wanted to be but i’ve realized how pointless the location is if i don’t have a support system around me.
Everything is ok. It's fine. *doesn't make going through it any easier*
I'm glad you're doing okay now ❤
I had a breakdown today. I just felt mentally exhausted to deal with everything. I just want to be left alone. I felt so done with life. But i am trying to survive and figure this out too. Deep breaths.
Your amazing we love you🤍🥰
15:45 - you look STUNNING 🥰
Don't we all feel like this....sometimes..
I felt this so hard. Thank you for being you, Morgan. You bring such hope and positivity into my life and I am so thankful for you and your family who let us into your lives and give us reasons to smile.
Hi Morgan , I am going through the same thing right now. Even I believe that the universe is guiding me. Stay strong. We are not alone
We love you. I relate sm. You’re beautiful keep your head up!!!
i have never felt so in tune with someone. it has been so lonely, I lost everyone and I have a pure heart, and it gets taken advantage of. you start to question what’s wrong with you, even though the answer is nothing, it certainly doesn’t feel like that. we are worth good energy, and people time. i am stuck in the past, and need to move forward, thank you for encouraging me to do so. you have such an optimistic look on life, and i appreciate you sharing, you are not alone, and you made me feel not alone. ❤️
This is so relatable rn
Oh Morgan. You started crying and I cried too. I feel you. But just know you got this. You are appreciated and you make a difference  ♡  I love you ,we all love you. We love seeing you. But remember  if you need to take time away from camera feel free.  Love you ♡
im sorry you're going through such emotional turbulences and especially alone been alone for the whole pandemic, had to cut off everyone, start from 0, job, people, friends, everything i can relate so much it feels too hard and too much to do for someone who only has good intention and a good heart feels like a punishment we dont deserve at all but the strongest ones go through the worst hardships because we're capable of going through them at least what i try to believe things will fall into place, slowly, one by one, little by little the biggest challenge is trying to stay aligned within ourselves and have the patience needed for everything to fall into place which sometimes can take so long it feels neverending but it will, i mean, i still hope so hopefully in a few months  our lives will make sense, and we will find our place again  ;;; <3
I really think if being in L.A changes your mood this much its not the place for you. Be where you are most happy better for the mental zone.
Amazing, you’re so brave sharing this! You know other people go through this but then you think why should I be like this there’s worse out there but then all in the same day your happy as and think why did I feel like that then back to being sad. It’s a roller coaster but it’s comforting to know you’re not the only one struggling day to day, hour to hour. Thank you, you are the best xx
Oh Morgan I wish I didn’t live across the planet because I think you are such a funny, kind, wonderful person and I would love to be your friend and hang out with you everyday girl. Keep going ❤️
The majority of the world is “ going through it “ right now . I keep telling myself my glass is half full, and remind myself that I have a lot to be grateful for too . And when I get occasionally get lonely , or start comparing my life to those who seem to have a “ perfect life “ I remind myself of sayings my mom use to say . You can count your true friends - the ones that have you’re back - on one hand, and no one, absolutely NO ones life is perfect .
This vulnerability was really helpful and important, thank you for sharing it
You should come back Home honey 😢😢😢
thanks for posting this video morgan ily ♥️
Giiiiirl.. literally me this past... 2 years. And sometimes ill just be sitting there with whoever.. family friends... and my dark cloud just appears like.. hi sorry im late. 🤦‍♀️ but I feel you. I feel like we need to be like best friends or something.
i'm so glad i'm not the only one who is too depressed to turn in schoolwork.. it's been a month for me.. also: me with my one pair of sunglasses: 👁👄👁
I wish we lived closer I feel like we would be best friends. Love you!! ❤️
morgan, let's have a look at your natal chart? this sense of hopelessness resonates with me because I experience it on a very constant aware level. I'm hyper sensitive and the thought of death always triggers this onslaught of depression and anxiety. Sometimes I can't stop thinking about it and it becomes difficult to shake off even after years of self discovery and self care. I looked into my natal chart and there is a very specific placement that makes me extremely prone and sensitive to all this and it made some sense lol. My 12th House has a placement with Scorpio & Pluto, the sign of the inner void and the planet of death, makes my thoughts and worries revolve around endings and death~
LITERALLY CAN RELATE 🤍 Everyone’s lives on social media are so perfect and even though they may not be behind the phone... it’s so hard these days to try and ignore
I’m literally FEEL this! I got stuck at my parents houses after Christmas break because of the pandemic. I was there for 4 months and I came back up last week. I had 4 days of nonstop crying because before I went home, this place became so negative to me. I thought going home would erase that negativity when in fact it just pushed it down. As soon as I came back, the feeling hit be like a ton of bricks! You’ve helped me from this video! I tend to run! I need to face them head on. Thank you 🙏🏻🥰
Welcome to high functioning depression. It's difficult but you're not alone at all with this Morgan and I'm hella proud of you for pushing yourself to do things. Though if you aren't already, I'd see the therapist again for more coping skills. I get the struggle and I'm rooting for ya, you got this!
Yes ma'am!!! That dress and jacket look fucking FIRE on you!!!  Morgan, you are so beautiful, inside and outside. You are stinking gorgeous. You're smart, you're kind, you have a good head on your shoulders. You're not stupid. It's okay to not feel okay sometimes. Life has been so weird for all of us for the past year and a half. And we don't know everything you're going through, or what you're dealing with.  But you're worth it. You're worth so so much. You're funny, amazing, entertaining, and I get you are the best daughter, sister and friend. And I know you already know, but I'll remind you anyway, you're not alone hunni. ❤️❤️❤️
Please, please find a therapist. It is the best investment in myself that I've ever made, and maybe it'll help you too.
I feel like I am you but just you know... English. Sending positive vibes☀️
Girl im in  the same situation mentally they deported my husband from chicago we had to leave everything behind me and the kids are latinos but we are 5th generation american its so hard to adjust out here I've been here for two years it has been so depressing,  I dont even shower anymore I don't care 💔 I'm sad all the time I just stay home watch TV,  im on my phone all day , its hard being poor out here no family no friends i don't even comb my hair I've been on auto pilot for two years and going 😔 I have family who doesn't even care about us im trying so hard but I dont even recognize me , im stuck 😢 in this depressing mental state ive gained so much weight i use to be vegan , the hard part is  being in a country where you feel you don't belong my kids its hard for them to adapt as well, its even sader when I don't have money for shoes or clothes for me and my kids but watching this video is making me aware that my mental state isn't healthy I feel like morgan is my only friend , keep posting more videos love from Mexicali baja California
Oh honey, not even half way through the video and I want to say Thank you for reminding me I’m not alone. There are so many others. Today was bad for me. Let’s all take a big breath.... xo
Oh Morgan, I’d catch a flight from England to LA just to give you a hug if I could! I’ve been there, trust me. A couple of years ago I was living in London and feeling exactly like you are now. I had a nice job, great friends, plenty of good things in my life, but I was crying myself to sleep most nights. I could be sat in a crowded restaurant or cinema and suddenly want to burst into tears because I felt so lost and empty.   I ended up moving out of London and settling somewhere closer to home, somewhere smaller and quieter. The change was scary, and I initially felt like a bit of a failure for not “making it” in the big city, but honestly it was the best decision I could’ve made. It was amazing how quickly my mental health took a turn for the better. I’m not saying this is what you have to do, but you always seem so much happier and full of life in Colorado, so it’s maybe worth considering?   Either way, I promise you this feeling will pass. You’re so cool and tough as nails, I know you’ll find your way in the end x
yey more morgan content :>
Life isn't about doing things you 'think' you should enjoy doing. Life is about doing the things you enjoy. Your environment and those within play a HUGE part on your inner peace and mentality. Screw what others do or want you to do. Step back from the toxicity so you can step forward into your own energy.
Get close to Jesus
Nhl my breakdowns are pretty similar 😂 Trying to talk through it and knowing it's ur brain just giving u the depressy chemicals sucks but I'm glad ur doing a lil better. Best thing that helps me is just go one day at time. Nothing else matters but the moments ur in now and how ur feeling. Listen to yourself and watch til tok, a youtuber or a movie. 😘
omg you put everything i've been feeling since I moved to L.A away from my family into one video...girl you are so strong and you have so much support. we'll figure it out!
#8 on trending omg ILYSM!!!
I really want to hug you ❤️❤️❤️ I love you Morgan and I love how real you are you make me feel less lonely because I feel the exact same way your it alone you really arnt I love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I truly hope you understand how strong and brave you are for being so open with what you’re going through. I’m sure you are helping a lot of people that watch your vids that are feeling similar ways and going through a rough time. I struggle with getting out of bed and being motivated because I have no career that I love. I’m obsessed with YouTube and the entire digital world which I would love to dive into. However, I feel like I’m too old and I just get stuck. You are out there trying things, living life, entertaining is and inspiring us all. Xoxo hope you get your happy mojo back really soon and keep it. ❤️
❤️❤️❤️
me a few weeks ago... youll get thru it... having a good support system helps alot! but this past year was a toll on alot of people...
100% you're just really lonely, I 100% feel you beech
Im praying for you tonight. ♥️ I Wish I could just hug you and be there for you when the sun sets.
I absolutely adore you!! I have an Emotional Support Canadian I could send you!! Ok, it's my almost 22 year old son or you could come up here and try the Canadian life!!!
LA is toxic for you right now
Sell me those clothes plleeaaassseee
It’s the DC shoes for me
You’re amazing. Just keep being you - you being light into dark spaces. Xoxo
Nobody’s life is perfect, all these fake people you see on social media just don’t show themselves truthfully, we all have struggles and have shitty down days, especially when you have depression (I’ve had it since my late 20s) . You’re such a beautiful person inside and out
Morgan sometimes I wish I was your room mate just so you don't feel so alone and we can talk through everything. A lot of what you said are feelings I share as well, especially when you said you're a good person and try to put so much good out there and you feel like it never works. I felt that DEEPLY. It feels like it's either "not enough" or people use your kind, positive self against you (like it feeds their ego). Having a good cry is completely healthy and I believe is a must! We must be honest with ourselves and our feelings if we're to move on and/or better ourselves and be stronger. Crying is not weakness! Do what you must to be happy! <333
I think you should get a roommate. It might helps. Also, you can always move back to live closer to family. They are yours family for a reason. Keep fighting and I hope better days are coming 💪 💖
So...you could make a list of things you enjoy, narrow it down, and see if there is a club, group you could join.  Once you are at places you enjoy, you'll start to make friends from those.  Then I don't t7hink you'll feel as lonely.  Also, if Colorado makes you happy, move back, WE'LL  STILL WATCH YOUR CHANNEL.  You are a great person and LA seems to suck the life outta you.
I really felt that Video .... i can relate... Depression and this feeling of emptyness is so Damn hard
everything is ok am not crying your the one crying
I relate 100%. I have severe body dysmorphia and social anxiety and they feed on each other. And I am depressed af even in my happiest moments. I need help and I am tired of figuring this shit out on my own. However, I don't know where to start. I feel lost but ironically I feel okay like "naaaah I don't need anything, it will be fine in a few days anyway!". Maybe we are just fooling ourselves..
Yup... I relate. It's okay to not wanna love alone dude, I'm so confused as to why you don't move home to Colorado? Be with family and trinity for a while?  I would 100% sink like a stone in the ocean if I lived alone.
I related to this so much. There are emotions that I can't put into words sometimes that you summed up so beautifully. I hope you find your peace and know that the people who look forward to your vlogs are rooting for you ❤️❤️❤️
Bring DC back 🤣😍
That soulcycle session sounds... awful?? Why would people go to that? I'm not shy & I would have straight up left!
I’ve going through something similar for the last few weeks. Thought I was alone feeling that way. Seeing that I’m not the only person who feels like that really helps.
Morgan you need to get TF out of LA, PLEASE! you can’t keep living like that 😭
You should have a roommate
It’s 12:36pm and I relate so fricken much !! Ik it hurts and all those thoughts.... Ik how you feel and how many of you guys feel and ugh I just want to hug you and cry with you❤️
I feel like me and you could be best friends. We have much in common, except I'm vegan, but otherwise really similar 😌💕 P.S. YOU ARE GORGEOUS ✨
I really want to be your friend
*get out of LA, babygirl.*
Girl 😫 You were breaking my heart watching this 😖 But in saying that I hope things are getting better and lifting up !    We love you Morgan , stay safe stay strong!
Morgan, you should totally do live virtual “meet-ups” with followers. Maybe not in mass numbers - maybe people could pay a small fee ($5 and even if you don’t want to keep it you could donate it, although get that coin girl!) and a certain number of people could do a virtual meet up with you where you literally just chat with other women like you, and you do like a virtual wine and spa night, or reorganize your closet and chat with other girls. There are SOOOOO many women that feel the SAME as you and if you started a virtual hangout, I guarantee it would be BOMB! 😊👍🏻 I would join! Especially if it was a regular weekly time that people knew they could get tickets for, or plan for, that would be EVERYTHING!!!! Either way, you’re killing it and you should be super proud of yourself. (PS, my undergrad degree was in psych prior to going to going grad school and I had a full existential crisis after graduating and started over. I felt the exact same way you do, and now that I’m married and have a new career I hope you read this and know you’ll be just fine - just DO. NOT. STOP. MOVING. FORWARD. Keep going and putting one foot in front of the other and know that even if you don’t feel like you have forward movement, you are going forward and in the process, you are legit helping other women like you going through the same thing. Don’t stop - other girls are watching and truly rooting for you because they believe in you.)
MOVE BACK HOME MORGAN😢💔💔 you love it there and we love you there❤️. Your content is at its best when you’re at your happiest. Always supporting you queen 👑
From experience it will get better with time , and you will come out stronger then ever
Morgan Im going to say this as nice as possible go back to Colorado get away from toxic ppl ... Im not even gonna say who bc I dont want you to hate me but you know. you had a glow in Colorado you are not made for la not many are n you now know why... Bc you are a real n true a honest loving kind beautiful young woman n that all works for you and we all love you for that js xoxoxo giant hugs baby girl
Hehe literally this has been my mood for the passed two weeks love you Morgan you’re literally amazing ❤️
I think you should move back to Colorado. You're clearly so much happier there. It's alright to want to be near family.
I just want to give you a hug girl! We’ve all been there! Now that I’m 29 and married I can see the other side and wish you could see it too (even just for a split second) just to be 100% sure it will happen. Keep going! You have an AMAZING attitude and you are so smart! You’re gorgeous and funny and if all else fails, just think about the fact that you haven’t even met me and probably never will, but somehow you have SUCH a magnetic personality that there is a 29 year old woman living in Michigan watching your videos, cheering you on! You will be everything you dream of and more - promise! 😊❤️
I actually wanna say thank you! Thank you so so so much for showing that we all struggle with mental health and helping normalize it. I hate that you felt that way but im thankful youre being open about it to show others that no ones life is perfect. We see what a person wants us to see but truth is we are ALL struggling we all are going thru something.  I feel like the more we normalize mental health the more people will be open and the less people will ashamed or hide their feelings. Our feelings are valid and we need to understand and accept that. I really wish more people were as honest and raw as you. This is why we love you so much. You show us Youre just as normal as us. We need to make sure people understand its absolutely ok to feel like crap or want to give up! Its ok NOT to be ok. We also need to remind them that you also get to start again the next day and temporary feelings dont warrant long term decisions. Its actually not weird to have really off days or to just be down. Point is that we pull thru it. Mental health is such a struggle but we are all STILL here and damnit we are making it!! You ARE enough and you WILL get thru this! WE will get thru this!! Stay strong💗
Completely understand how you’re feeling. Think we’re all a bit lost with the state of the world, add mental health onto of that and it’s so hard. I have just been diagnosed with OCD and even though I have a husband and a baby i feel lost and alone but watching your videos really help. You brighten so many days 🖤 please look after yourself you are so loved
I WOuld loVE TO BE YOUR FRIEND OH MY GAWD! I RELATE TO THIS ENTIRE VIDEO
I relate soo much, im going through a real ass tough time and doing full time study at uni. shits hard bro <3
you have the biggest heart, I love that you try to see the best in people, and not judge them even if they appear to be toxic... I look up to that a lot
Your transparency is so refreshing and it really helps! The mental health struggle is way too real. Love you Morgan❤️
You are so relatable n loved by all of us n ill take all ur tops 😂
I cried with you when you were saying “everything is okay.” Sometimes all you have is just telling yourself that it’s okay and everything will be alright. 💛
Thank you for always being so honest & for sharing this, you are not alone <3333 we love you!!!!
Yah
I love you because you don’t hide shit and are so real. I can relate girl 💖
Love you so much Morgan! Never related so much with one person in my life❤️ we’ll get through this together gal
The “perfect” lives are only a snippet of their lives, you don’t know if once the camera is off they sit on the floor and sob, you don’t know if they stuff their faces then make themselves sick, or wait for their partners to come home and abuse them. nobodies life is perfect and it is refreshing to watch a video that is showing life how it is.  You sound very lonely. Big hugs and  Keep smiling sweetie.
Girl, trust me I've been struggling this week too and I'm sure Lots of other people are going through it too. I think you need to go buy a house in Colorado near family and friends
So pretty in the red dress and the jeans fitted so well too! Jealous!
I love you ❤️ I totally connected with everything you said. Sending you a hug ❣️
🥲 same girl..... same
Yeah aren’t we all, not just you
You're so beautiful inside and out, Morgan.
I’ve two pair of warmer weather jeans and one I’ve worn pretty much daily this winter ... all are ragged and hand stitched for all the holes. I’ve probably 8 white T-shirts and a few heavier ones. 1 sweatshirt, 1 pair of socks, several one-off hand knitted slippers/socks (several more fit my right foot than my left - that’s how I make them, to ‘fit’ my feet), one coat, one knitted sweater, and one windbreaker. 1 cap, 2 knitted hats, one crocheted hat. Annnd. That’s it I think.   Yup, I’m a run-down slob.  I’d ‘lllllllike’ to fall back on a horrible fire of 2008 that took 97% of everything I had, as an excuse for just not having gotten back into giving a rats ass about stuff, but I know that’s incorrect.... though, something in me did disappear from that event. Hey, it’s only been 12 years, so, I’m not pushing myself. HA!  It was fun seeing your pile accumulate on your bed like that — perhaps one day I-too will have that happy problem!  Joe Guelph,  Ontario
The way Morgan said about "toxic" people is the kindest most empathetic thing I ever heard.
I feel this so much. You're doing great. This past year has exasperated all those feelings. Things will fall into place soon ♡
I love how Morgan's always wearing the necklace Ryland gifted her
8:58 omg broke my heart🥺🥺
I'm my mid 30's and relate to this so much. I don't even text anyone anymore but it's okay. We will all be okay.
Cleaning out your closets can feel so therapeutic. Every once in a while I just grab an empty trash bag and just walk around the house getting rid of things I haven't touched in a long time
I really appreciate this video. Going through a hard time too, and you put all my feelings into words ♥️
I would die to be your friend Morgan... You're so sweet ...
sendin that "prayer or two", but also can I just say that this so relatable. I know its probably so awkward and uncomfy to post this, but you being vulnerable and sharing this is something that is gonna  help soooo many people 💛 proud of you Morgan!! and umm if you need friends in LA idk hmu we can get socially distanced coffee or something 😂
Morgan!! Move to Idaho, I would love to be your friend!! You’re an amazing person with so much heart and so many unique qualities. I seriously love you!! Take care of yourself sweet girl ❤️
The part where you said "I'm getting ready every day and doing all the things I'm supposed to be doing, but still feel empty inside" Morgan, it may feel uncomfortable right now, but the more you keep doing it, it will get easier. You have to re-train your mind to move away from your negative emotions. Your mind is stronger than you think and you have the ability to write your own story. I also went through a crippling depression and felt all the same feelings you described and I just want you to know it gets easier. P.S. this is the content we all need. I would rather watch this than the fake "influencer" superficial lives that have taken over social media any day ♡
I really wonder how much Shane and Rylands drama has hurt Morgan
Not me having a mental breakdown today and then watchin this to end my night. We are not alone ❤️
I need this Morgan. Thank you so much. You don't understand how much I needed this. Love ❤️
I’m sorry your going through it right now.  I’m sending you hugs 🤗 I love watching your videos and know that you are a beautiful smart women! 💕💕
This is probably the most important video on youtube right now. Being so vulnerable and using your platform to start these conversations really does save lives. Thank you for your truth Morgan.
Crying over my quesadilla with my cat lmao. 😭 It’s so hard to let go of the past. I struggle with it every day. Sending virtual hugs. We are not alone ❤️
i love u so much
Thanks for always being real💕 this one hit home-  I went into a dressing room for the first time since covid and hot diggity damn I wasn't ready for that reality check 😅
So relatable! We will all get through this!
Wow. I can't believe how relatable this is. Hoping things get better for the both of us<3
ok this is not the point of thisvideo but I have strong hatred for the soul cycle instructor that i don't know at all.
I feel that too, I am unemployed for an year and I don't talk to anyone in my life except my parents. Somedays I have energy to make things better but someday it hits hard that things are not what I wished for but still I am hoping one day things will be better.
Definitely cried because we're the fucking   same. Like hella tears. Thank you for this,  ill be watching this for realness and connection and motivation for a long time. We got this, Morgan. You're not stupid. You're an inspiration with fantastic taste in sunglasses.
I've been feeling the same. I haven't recorded
Ask us if we care? Not!!! You don’t know Rough...
I love what you said about not believing people are toxic. It really is about being able to have mutual understanding of loving and treating people the way they need to be loved and treated. If everyone thought this way, the world would be SO much different. You're genuine, intelligent, and so witty. The things you say and talk about, especially in this video, have great purpose and intent behind them. These are all the reasons why I watch your videos and I've been a long time subscriber. Thanks for being real 👌🏻❤
I’ve never had someone to relate to so closely. Thank you for making me feel less alone in this world.
i also struggle with my mental health. i hate feeling stressed with everything and having racing thoughts on toxic things and spiraling because of it. what makes it worse is that i try to understand why i feel these things but i just never get it right. one day i think i come to a conclusion and the next i "realize" it was false. like, i know that i have high functioning autism, as well as adhd i think. but i have other problems and i dont know if its my autism and idk if everybody else feels this way and its just... And i often worry that im being toxic deep down, like if im selfish or attention seeking or seeking victimhood and such. and its just frustrating and these feelings start to become intrusive thoughts as if these ideas are beginning to take over my train of thought. like what am i protecting? whats wrong with me? i just dont think im like everyone else? but why? it  its literally a war inside me. knowing that something about me isnt good but not doing much about it because you still feel safer being that way. its a dilemma. its a war and im just done with the world. i just want to flee to an island.
Morgan is so beautiful ❤️
When morgan started crying saying everything is okay thats me right now...im morgan right now
Maybe LA is not good for your mental Health Morgan
so im confused, i hear about you moving from colorado to LA and back and forth often but when you went back to colorado, did you still keep your apartment in LA? because it would seem like an extreme hassel to take everything out and put everything back in in the course of a few months
I felt like that a long time ago and medication and therapy save my life.  My depression is still here with me, but she's not my enemy anymore. Medication save me, after a lot of medical tests to see if it was my thyroid, my hormones or anything else . And therapy helped a lot
Have you ever checked out The Holistic Psychologist on here and Instagram?
hahaha....so many people don't even have a place to LIVE yet yer crying like you lost all yer limbs & must use a computer to speak....stop playing the POOR ME game lady
I feel the same way. College online during a pandemic is not okay. My school implemented a pass/fail for this semester because everyone's GPA's dropped. It's not just you, I promise. I can barely get through twelve credits.
I'm 42 and going through a major change in my life right now.......thank you for this video. Your vlog is very relatable. This is so me the last 2 months trying to sort my life out one day at a time....I'm sure everything will be ok. Maybe it's just a transition or milestone we all go through from time to time....
Just as you feel empathy for those around you, we feel the same for you. No one is judging you for the overwhelming emotions you are feeling. Give yourself time. Sending love.
It’s not you, it’s your chemical imbalance, you aren’t responsible for that, you have no control over it....but it’s okay to be mad at it, and frustrated about it...you’re doing great tho <3
I think so many of us are dealing with a daily struggle of dealing with morning what was and trying to wade through all the changes being thrown at us wishing you the best Morgan I get so much joy from the energy you bring forward
YOU LOOK SO GOOD QUEEN!!!!
Oh my god. The level of relatability is absolutely insane and bringing me back. Your description of rocks in your stomach & being afraid of the sun to set is something I remember feeling when I was younger but not being able to explain it. I still feel the rocks, but I always describe it as something missing, something feeling wrong, I call it grief but I’m not grieving anything. It’s just a pit.
Morgan, just keep finding yourself. You will find peace in knowing who you are and what you want for yourself.
I just want to say thank you for putting this out, you are the bravest person I know. The things you said during your breakdowns resonated with me so much. I literally cried watching this video because I have been feeling like this for sometime as well. Where I just keep telling myself that I am okay and that everything is okay but I am just screaming inside with an unimaginable pain. I love your videos, thank you for just being you. 🖤♥️
I can’t tell if this is just about herself or something happened with someone else
I moved across the country as well and I’ve never felt at home since I moved. I’ve struggled with the lack of friends and family around and the feeling of personal connection. I’m sorry you’re feeling like this, you’re not alone. This last week has been a rough one for me too, I send so many hugs and good vibes ❤️
“Should I put tiki torches in my room to feel something?” Lmaoooo 😂
You are looking healthy and gorgeous!!!!! Keep your head up beautiful!!!
Aww! Gurl, its an LA thing..trust its gana go away. I went thru the same shit like, sometime ago (kinda go in n out on this self battle even now) but it gets better as soon you CHOOSE to change your mentality. Easily the hardest part but you can do it and the only way you can start is with honesty.
Aaaw sweetie ya gunna make me cry ! Pobody's Nerfect as i always say ! I Love you !! <3
Hahaha Yes soul cycle is intense. I remember my instructor looking at me with glee as I sweat. I liked using the bikes inbetween classes. They have digital classes at my gym and I built up endurance without being yelled at. You just do you, hun! This is hard, yes when you are used to being there for others and now have to be there for yourself but this can be a chance to learn what you really enjoy and need to thrive. ❤💚💜💙💛💗
I completely understood this on a crazy level... I have been working on losing some weight and overall being healthier, and that process is taking me on the craziest mental journey ever. There are days when I feel like I’m amazing and then the next day I could immediately feel like I made no progress and I suck... we love you Morgan! Stay strong honey x
Girl I feel like we are literally dealing with the same thing, just different circumstances. Mine has a little sprinkle (a gallon or 20) of health issues mixed in to my pile of trauma and depression which is awesome. I need to get out of my parent's toxic house too (I'm almost 26 btw) but I feel too mentally and physically ill to be able to get a job after being laid off almost a year ago, plus idk what i even want to do anymore because the 9-5 just ain't for me sis but I'm getting kicked off my parent's insurance in July which is FAB... so who knows if and when I'll be mentally and financially able to get my own place. Everything just seems overly complicated and hard and like a non stop struggle and I'm losing and have lost some friends as well because of how much of a mess I am and how no one truly understands what pain I'm dealing with daily. Let's be friends...I'll just probably be socially awkward at first but It'll be great. We can go to therapy together or something....also...therapy. I can't afford that shiz!! like HOW?!
This is so relatable and just what I needed to see today. I'm going through it too and knowing that someone else knows what thats like helped a tiny bit.
I have a lot of thoughts and I’d like to put them collectively into one by saying: I love this content and I love you.
I had goosebumps numerous times throughout this video because I could relate to this so deeply. Know that you aren't alone & you have people in your corner. You aren't stupid for how you feel. I'm sending you lots of love, Morgan! <3 Also, girl.. that red dress on you is STUNNING! I'm glad you didn't get rid of it during your closet clean out.. so beautiful!
this is the most relatable thing I’ve seen in awhile. I’ve been struggling so bad lately and it’s clear that I’m not the only one. 🥲
15:33 Gorgeous!  19:16 Morgan:  "We have had a good ride together..." Me:  "Well....."  ;)
I’ll be your friend ❤️ hot mess or not x
Thank you morgan! I'm setting my alarm and and trying tomorrow, because of you 💜 thank you so much for this video!!!
The most relatable thing I've watched all day. I love you Morgan, hugs! 💖💕
This makes me wonder what kind of people they are hiring at Soul Cycle to call customers bottom feeder? 🤔
I feel like your face is thinner
Morgan!! You are a strong, intelligent and capable woman. You will survive all that life has in store for you, and you will find that you will attract a group of like-minded people who will uplift and support you.
This video saved me, thank you for making it known we aren’t alone
Morgan thank you for posting this. I watched this after a literal mental breakdown where I cried in my bed for a few hours. Thank God for my husband coming in and just letting me cry on him. You made me feel normal today. Thank you for saving me in my moment of darkness
I absolutely love you. You did an amazing job on describing how so many of us, I’m sure are feeling. You positively reach so many; touch so many, and give a lot of us hope & a strength for a different outlook.
You are everything. I wish you could see your worth. :(
You had a bad day and 200,000 strangers cared enough to watch a 20 minute video about it. Trust me when I say, you’re ok. You are doing fine ❤️ Nothing you see on social media is the truth. Think about every thing you’ve ever posted. Did you edit it? Face tune? Fib the caption a bit about how great the day was or how happy you are? They are too and most likely they’re fibbing it harder than you. There are still people who look at your posts and think “Why don’t I have it as together as Morgan does?!” and they feel bad about themselves. It’s a bad day. No one needs to be as hard on themselves as they are. ESPECIALLY you when you’re trying to show young women to not be so hard on themselves. Please use your platform for good. Show them they can be such excellent people and not to worry about nasty bitches who call them bottom feeders.
I agree its so hard to make friends here in LA. especially w stuff being closed
I literally just ripped my whole closet apart too lmao.
I can 100% relate to how you feel about “existing”. It IS really fucking difficult to just exist when you have depression. People without it don’t get it at all. I have Chronic Pain and I struggle to exist everyday. I just try to live day-to-day and literally just survive.   I wish I had a friend like you (or actually you) who understands what it’s like to feel that way. It’s so fucking lonely. I’m also super extroverted so being home alone all the time might as well be torture. I’m the happiest when I’m surrounded by other people. At least when I’m around others I get a distraction from the pain. I’m only 32 btw.   I feel like the odds of Morgan seeing this are like 1:1,000 but I’ll try anyways. I need shit to look forward to and it’d be nice to get a response.   PS even though I have chronic pain & an invisible disability, I’m still trying to work and make a life outside of my home. I’m going to get certified as a Respite Worker for Foster Kids really soon and that actually would give me a reason to live. I’d be able to make a difference in their lives and give me purpose.
I wanna be your friend! 😢
Morgan, You are so damn beautiful.
I can’t begin to tell you how much I absolutely resonate with this. Like I was out here looking up mental hospitals. You got this. We got this.
This is the most relatable video I have come across in a long time. Like I have felt like this since the start of lockdown and it’s just gotten progressively worse over the past year. I don’t talk to my local friends anymore, I don’t reach out to anyone else, they don’t reach out to me. It’s been really rough but please don’t feel like you’re alone cause it’s a really tough time right now and I genuinely feel like it’s getting to all of us. Hang in there ❤️ this too shall pass. We’ll all get through it 🥺
I want to be your friend.
I would sell my soul to be best friends. with you, in 100% seriousness. I'm 20 carrying the anxiety of an 80 year old man who went to war
This is how I have been feeling lately and thank you for making me feel better and not so alone in life
I feel this. lets be friends girl
So dumb
Oh goddamn, hearing your voice tremble almost broke me. Sorry you're having a rough go of it, Morgan. Cheers to better days and new horizons.
I just had a conversation about this and life with my friend. I feel the same and I get it. We’d get along so well 😭 you’re beautiful and God knows what’s best for you. People will come in your life at the right time. You don’t have to change yourself. There’s genuine people although it’s so hard to find. You’re doing great 🥰
girl, me too.
We're all with you girl! You're so strong and an inspiration 💗
Barely into the video ,, don’t go back to that cycle class that lady is a biiiiizzzzzznitch!!!!! That’s horrible and people like that are a trigger I get it cuz I’m the same way and struggle everyday with my mental health
I could never live anywhere that I don’t have friends. Like...all my friends live in WI., I couldn’t imagine me moving for whatever reason. It’s clear you’re happiest in Colorado. That’s where you should be.
I totally get you. I’m sorry you deal with this BECAUSE I know how you feel.  My husband and I are living in different states due to finances. My grown children and my grandkids live in California where my husband is. It breaks my heart. But housing is SO expensive in California I had to go to Oregon with our son until my husband retires in a couple years. It kills me. But I just gotta believe that we will all be together soon. Damn, everyone has their stuff they have to deal with and it sucks.......stay strong Morgan. 💪🏻
Ok yes. I love how real you are
Morgan, I also lived alone for a few years in my twenties, and now as a woman in her thirties I recognise that because of my depression diagnosis that lifestyle is not suitable for me long-term. I moved back in with family, and then lived with housemates (who were strangers when I moved in - no prior friendships). If I was in your shoes I would examine the pressures and situations that make your depression rear its head most accutely, and then work from there. Getting on an antidepressant that agrees with my system has also had a massive life-saving effect. I too had to quit medication in the past, and then re-visit. Just wanted to leave this comment as I know a lot of your audience skew younger; there is hope beyond crippling depressive episodes and you're in control. It'll just take time and some smart planning. You got this girl.
I completely understand how you are feeling.  I had to take today off work because of my anxiety and depression. It’s fucking sucks.  There’s literally no perfect human beings in this world and if they are perfect then they are not a human being. 😂  I hope you feel better one day soon, you deserve it. ❤️👍🏼
I relate to this so much. After my dad died a few years ago, I went through this time for like a year or two where I didn’t deal with it and I had a 4.0 at college/grad school, went out with friends all the time, and every night I’d come home and just sob and I couldn’t understand why but I felt so alone and empty. It still happens a few days out of the month sometimes (years later) but to a much lesser extent. So I feel this so much. Keep reaching out. Keep talking to your therapist and getting those skills. You are doing incredible. (Actual Therapist here btw ❤️)
I don’t know if anyone does this but whenever I get depressed or just get in my head about life I go through my sad playlist and talk to myself about how I feel till I get to a point where one song catches my attention and sing along with it while I cry ....
Remember you are amazing, caring beautiful person. You are a strong women. So may feel the same way you do. You got this girl. We all are here for you. Remember everyone cares about you.  We all go through some tuff times especially more during covid. Try something new. Remember you are special and loved. Big hugs. 🤗🤗🤗🤗
I wish i could just hug you 💜💜 your doing amazing i am so proud of you🤞🏽
I feel the exact same way. it’s so nice to hear it said out loud and not just something ruminating it my head that makes me feel like I’m the only one
This is so real! I love that you also show this side of you 😍 you have such an important voice!
Morgan I wish we could be friends ❤️
I want to start off by saying sorry that you are currently going through this.. but I also wanna say thank you for sharing your story because literally everything that you discuss is exactly how I’m feeling and I never knew how to put it into words.. I struggle every day with my mental health and I just wish I could get better and some days are better than others and some are just really really hard and you couldn’t have said it better because now I know that I’m not alone that there is someone out there who feels exactly the way I feel... I just wish I could say I had support and people who love me surrounding me and it’s just me fighting a battle with myself... I watch your videos to comfort me I want to thank you for posting even when you’re not in the mood for it. ❤️ can’t thank you enough...
Maybe you’re an empath and feel other’s emotions and that’s why you’re feeling so many feelings and you don’t know where they’re coming from . Sending love and positive energy ❤️
Morgan, you are absolutely gorgeous! I mean seriously! You are absolutely beautiful!!!!! ❤
Morgan, this past week was terrible for me too, mentally and physically. I had a terrible panic attack last Sunday which spiraled me into a depression and just being on edge/anxious all week. I was also late turning in assignments because I had no motivation which is very unlike me. Something must have been in the air! We will get through this. Love ya
i wish we could be friends, i’m around your age, i have barely any friends, i isolate myself but i hate being alone 🥺
I totally know how you feel girl. You'll get through this in the end life moves forward and you just take one step at a time no pressure, don't feel like it needs to be right away, take each step on your own terms. Forget what everyone says it's up to you to take that step forward for your well being. But keep those that bring positivity in your life. 😊 Your beautiful, you'll find that happiness and it takes time 💕 trust me you are not alone girl! ❣️
I know you mentioned being on an antidepressant. No matter what people say about meds I can tell you that chemical imbalances are real. Many people can go on an antidepressant and eventually come off but a chemical imbalance must constantly be regulated. Please take care of yourself and do what you need to do ❤️
I love you Morgan! Things will get better. Keep working thru it 😊😘 and you look gorgeous 😊
I'm a 44yo man, and I don't even know how I got to liking Morgan so much. I guess cuz she's very real, open, and grounded. I wish you all the best. Also, to hell with that SoulCycle vibe.
You’re going to be okay.                                               I’m talking to everyone.
"Jeans that I've been waiting to fit for the past 2 years that will just never fit" I've never related more to anything in my life
The amount of times I wanted to give you and hug during this
I promise you. I relate fucking hard to this entire video.
I think you would fit in with light workers and they could really help you feel better and find your purpose.  I've seen how spiritually in tune you are.  Take a psychic course or something. That's what I did and found many like minded people.
you really do make me feel not alone morgan x thank you for this video.
Same.
I want to reach through the screen and just give you a fricken hug dude
You are not alone💕 I have felt this way recently. Anxiety is no joke. But you are rocking it! Celebrate the small victories like getting dressed lol. I just had a baby so the days where I am fully dressed and with makeup are good days lol.
Morgan I think you look great!!! It’s ok to go through it and I’m sorry you are but I just wanted to let you know I think you are beautiful! ❤️
Lol that lady screaming at you to scream I would of looked her dead in the eye and went 🖕🏽😌🤣
oh no im so unhappy with all the money i have, ppl have real problems
The way you inspire me.... come to NY I’m 21 and hella lonely but lots of fun. We can share depression symptoms!!
I’m sure this was hard for you to post but I’m glad you did. I’ve been feeling exactly like this for the last couple months. 🥲 Also you are a literal Bratz doll you dress so cute!
AT 8:40 you made me bust out crying with you. You are in the shadow of others and need to move on. You are absolutely amazing and beautiful. Funny and smart. And LA is a trash fire place full of fake people. You are doing online school just move somewhere else. You can always visit Ryland. Be there for family but be there for yourself first. You make wonderful content when you do so please know i was a long time fan of other people and found you cause them. And i am glad i did. and i am thankful for your presence online.
Morgan I’ve been feeling the exact SAME way to a tee you’re not alone
How many of those people aren't real?. You're being real and honest with all of us.
Wtf I wanna hug you so bad???
You are beautiful Morgan inside and out !  May God bless you 🙏
Morgan mfing adams YOUR AN AMAZING HUMAN! I love your vlogs girl! Keep your chin up girl!
Omg I feel this so much!! I moved for school and I’m only 1.5 hours away from home but I don’t have time to go home because school is a lot and I just feel so lonely in my apartment :( I have friends, I have a good time with them but just like you said, as soon as I get home, the loneliness sets in.  I just got on sertraline though so we’ll see if that fixes things 🥲 We will get through this !! ♥️
Ever since I lost my grandma 2019 Christmas Day , I haven’t been the same. I’m not myself ... I find myself often feeling empty. Hope you feel better
Thank you for sharing this. It’s incredibly validating to see other people feeling the same way I do, struggling with the same intrusive thoughts and anxieties and depression. I know it’s incredibly hard to share these moments publicly, being this vulnerable about something so personal is so hard, and I’m so proud of you for sharing that with us. Life keeps moving and you will too, try to take some solace in that💕
Girl move back to Colorado 😭😭 LA is obviously a trigger for you!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Low key I feel like if I knew you in real life we would be best friends hahaha.
Oh my god me seeing my own mental breakdown in Morgan's
You are not alone. I understand and can relate to everything you’ve said! ❤️ you got this girl!! I also remind myself, this too shall pass and it always does!
Oh man Morgan. Watching this reminds me of where I was when I was in my early 20’s. For the most part growing up, I only had a couple friends and my mom. Then I went to college, graduated and in my mid 20’s lived in the big city whilst driving back and forth to my mom. She was the only constant I had when I was living in an unfamiliar place. I honestly hated my city life, and felt more comfortable in the familiar. In the city, I didn’t really care for my job, I dated men that didn’t give a crap about me, and only dated me for their selfish reasons, and I guess in a way I did the same, looking for some kind of companionship and acceptance. I got to a REALLY low point, like, bottom of the barrel, and then a light went off. You talking about how you don’t believe people can be toxic is relatable in a sense. I used to give people the benefit of the doubt before realizing I come first. And maybe you’re right; people aren’t toxic, but their choices and lifestyles can definitely be toxic to the betterment of you. You are obviously running on empty, looking for enrichment and a constant. It’s unclear everything you’re struggling with, whether it be mental health, environment, positive/negatively impacting people, etc. There are so many sources to reach out to, but my best advice is to take solace and pride in being selfish and boastful of yourself. And I know it’s not an easy road to get there, but you seem like you’re running on empty, and you are nothing to anyone, much less yourself if you have nothing left in the tank. Trust yourself, love yourself, know you’re not alone in your feelings about ones self. ❤️❤️❤️
Morgan is courageous, and I admire that.
You are a very sweet girl, you shouldn't feel so sad,so many people love you. I am a  mom, so I feel very motherly for you right now..Please take care of yourself (hugs)
It’s good to express how your feeling and you don’t have to act like your happy when your not. I too suffer from depression & am so proud how you talked about how your feeling.   Wish you could maybe move closer to a family member.. your an amazing,beautiful,successful woman and know that so many people r right here if you need to talk.  One minute,one hour,one day at a time✨✨💫🌷💜
Oh my gosh! Thank you so much for sharing this. It’s so nice to hear that someone else gets it. Keep on keepin on 💕
Morgan, I never stop feeling that way no matter what I do. I’ve tried reconnecting with the people that broke parts of me and nothing until I started watching your videos. Morgan you have inspired me in so many ways that you don’t even know. I’ve finally decided to go to the gym from your vegan video(I didn’t want to go vegan) and work on myself. Thank you for being my only support without even knowing. I wish I could help in some way. Thank you for always being you even when you don’t feel like yourself and actually talking about it instead of holding on to it. I love you;) Here’s my IG marybeth_1104.
I really feel what you’re going through right now and I’m so sorry. Like I truly think you described my life word for word. It will get better that’s what everyone says but getting through it by yourself is the hardest part
Most relatable channel ever. So thankful for your honesty. We are all struggling so hard during this time. My doctor said she has never seen this mental illness crisis ever in her career.
💜You are a beautiful woman 🥰 good talking it through 🥰
100 percent relate rn .
do a genetic depression test to see what prescriptions work best with your depression genetically
Product Placement everywhere in this video.
Awww we love you morgan and you are never alone 💕💗
Girl! I feel you I am not alone and either are you! I love your realness! Thank you for always being you cause, regardless of what you think, you are a light in the darkness.
You are a beautiful person and I'm so glad you shared these hard moments. We all go through stuff at times. You are not ever alone!
Morgan... Thank you for sharing... This definitely helped me and im sure others! Thank you for being so transparent... I can only imagine how hard it is.. I wish I could give you a big hug! Your working through it and your doing so good!!! You look amazing too! Your so beautiful on the inside out!
Thank you Morgan. Thank you for sharing so much that you don't really need to share just to let us know that we aren't alone. I really appreciate your honesty and transparency.
I've had to turn to God and my faith to help me get through mintue by minute can be difficult with being home for a year I have severe anxiety of what the world's gonna be like when everything starts trying to back to normal ...and I get scared depressed but I pray and tell myself nothing last forever and the feelings go away or get milder I've had to accept it's ok to not be ok. Just wanna say to anyone reading this you're awesome things will get better and you are worthy.❤️❤️ Peace and love
I think you need to move back to where your family is. We need our families and friends, especially right now. I have had depression and anxiety for over 30 years and if there was something that I could have changed was to move back closer to my family. Keep fighting Morgan.
I could go on and on and tell you how amazing you’re .. and you shouldn’t feel this way .. but I don’t know your pain .. you said it best understand the world. And realize you don’t know the hurt people are caring around to make them the way they’re .. it sucks to be an empath . It’s easier to be a bitch
I love you Morgan!!!!!! I'm praying for you!! That lady is the jerk!! I do not believe in the universe, I believe in God. He's trying to get you to where you should be honey. The problem isn't you, It's them💜
You are amazing and beautiful but if being with your family in Colorado makes you happy then you should go your platform will follow no matter where you go.
Morgan, you look amazing. And red is your color!!!  And I totally understand how you feel. That’s been me the last few months. Except I don’t get dressed or leave my bed lol. I love you I hope you feel better soon! We’ll get through it! Sending love
You are not alone with feeling like this! There’s is absolutely nothing wrong with feeling this way! Many people feel exactly the same but just don’t say it. I hope you continue to grow stronger! 💖
Thank you, Morgan, for being so authentic. So many of us have been there and feel like no one else has. It's really profound to show it so honestly, especially on this platform.
I can relate to this video on another level right now. We’re in this together girly 💕
I'm sorry you're going through a tough time. I'm not sure if you're currently seeing one, but talking to a psychologist regularly, one that makes you feel comfortable, is really important. This phase in your life is only temporary. Time heals everything <8
Morgan , I’m literally you ! Your videos bring me so much comfort! 🤍🦋🐙
This has been me this week too. I'm not sure what it is right now, but I'm just tired.
definitely needed to see this today
Here for you Morgan <3
I wish I could give Morgan a big hug.. 🥺
Awww everything will be okay at least you are optimistic I hope you feel better soon Morgan ily!!
Crying into your breakfast whilst trying to convince yourself you're ok, is the most relatable thing I've ever seen on YouTube.
Watch the secret on netflix :)
You need a car girl
Thank you so much for posting this. You are loved and so appreciated. Thank you for showing that we are not alone. I love you
( don't put the tea tags on your tea )
Those dc shoes are adorable  I want themn
Pls let’s be internet friends we can cry together 🥺
Fcking ugh...me dude...me always 😢
I know how you feel ❤️ most days I’m just running on autopilot survival mode. We’ll get through it 🥺❤️
Morgan... why are you where you are if you're not happy? I don't know you at all but, you are sad. It's perfectly okay to be sad when something places you in a sad moment. Trying to talk yourself through your emotions is hard. You're so outgoing in moments and, strikingly beautiful.  Your outlook for possibilities is spot on... keep saying what you want. You are absolutely right, the universe does help to guide you but, ultimately, you are in charge. Something you already know. Be happy sweet girl ...you deserve it.
Oh shit, we're both super synced up
Morgan trust me u are not the only one feeling that way everyday! U should go to a therapist, they can really help u with techniques and ways to approach it!! Love u💕
We love you Morgan !!❤️
Never related to a video more. Making friends is harder when your older because you can see all the fakeness now so we choose more selectively. It sucks but it’s the reality.
i have honestly have never related more to a video than now
When you broke down crying saying I’m okay, I really felt that. I moved to a new state by myself and sometimes it’s hard bc there is no need to fake that you’re okay bc there is no one around. Hold in there, love you 🖤.
and you still look incredible while sobbing.. a true icon
Well, your used to being around your family and thats when you seem the happiest. But now that your back in LA you're in your apartment by yourself and it'll get lonely. Plus you can't hardly find genuine people in LA. I think you should move back to Colorado and buy you a fixer upper house. I know you'll miss Ryland but you can go with your mom when she goes to visit. Go and stay a week or two with him. Do what makes you happy! You got this girl. You're strong and you'll get through this.
Feeling my own vibes....*hormones intensify* 😂 however I feel like you need to be closer near to your closest loved ones/friends at this point. Move back home! No point in torturing yourself!
Thank you for sharing this Morgan. There’s a lot of us who feel the way you do and while you’re hurting, know you’re not alone.  You’re doing incredible and we’re all so proud of you.
Every. Single. Thing. You said I completely understand. I have said those exact things/done the exact things and it’s so nice to know someone feels the exact way I feel. Especially the comparing the life I used to have that I loved, and now I’m miserable everyday.
Wow... I want to hug you so bad!!! I had suffer from anxiety since 8 and I'm still have breakdown and panic attacks.  At my age now you just deal with it and keep breathing.  Remember that You are amazing, beautiful and sensitive woman.  Keep taking good care of YOURSELF in every level.  And please consider to move back home, it's when I see you more happy!  Blessings
this fucking breaks my heartttt i fucking WISH we could be friends COME TO AUSTRALIA PLEASE AND THANK YOU
My husbands deployed for a year and I’m alone too, I feel you girl, being alone is scary!
Morgan, girl I feel you. I have been feeling like this lately too. I am so happy that you are comfortable enough to post this so that we can all see that YouTubers can be relatable. I love you. Thank you.
Thank you for sharing. I’m in the same place
you sharing your journey is helping so many people including myself. thank you sm
i am an extrovert in that i gain my energy from other people. so, i feel most "alive" or like i am my "best self' when i am around others and serve some purpose with them (making them laugh, helping them do something, providing them company)-so when i am alone i get in a really weird funk and slump. this doesn't mean i don't enjoy my time alone to recharge. perhaps you are extroverted in that way as well. the absence of people isn't just loneliness but it's a feeling of no energy/self
I love all the bigger glasses that you threw away. I think they really suit you.
I’m constantly feeling bad for the fact that I feel this way too, yet I’m so blessed in my present life now, today. I feel like “how dare I feel this way, when so blessed now”. But I can’t help how I feel 🥺 so I’m sad you feel this way too, but it feels good to not be the only one.
Why can't I find someone like you in my real life?!?! I literally want and crave for a best friend like you. I'm so sorry that you are struggling and I completely mean it when I tell you that I'm here for you, and I hate that this comes across in a creepy way when I'm just being genuine.
<3
Morgan, just know you are NOT alone! So many of us are feeling SAME as you. Look, Im 48...yes forty eight & STILL struggle with many issues. .Childhood trauma, chronic health issues,+other life struggles. IIve raised 3 amazing kids, happily married to my HS sweetheart & found a renewed purpose+a new❤❤❤ with my 2 new grandbabies. That said, lifes not easy, I get overwhelmed & dont have it figured out. Its ok. Think thats part of the journey,theres purpose & joy in that jourmey. Youre helping so many & a LOVELY person. Dont forget that!! You give US SO much! Thanks for that. Givr yourself the grace youd give your friends & family if they were struggling❤💯💪👏🏼👍
all of gen z in one video
I just want to be your best friend
You've progressed, Morgan! That's a lot on its own, even still here you are trying to cope and understand!   I've always appreciated this quote from Joan Rivers. Maybe it will have some impact on you as well. "Listen. I wish I could tell you it gets better. But it doesn't get better. You get better." The whole "you get better" thing is kind of cliche but it's true. Like life still sucks. My brain still sucks but I've used DBT to learn skills I didn't have previously. I felt happiness at some point last year. While it only lasted a few months, I now know that I have the capacity to feel it. I hope you find something positive that works for you or at the very least relieves your pain from time to time.
we love you<3
Crazy that you posted a video about this last night I just started crying in my bed because I suddenly felt like I am a failure and that I haven't succeeded in life. Your videos and Rylands videos help me through my darkness inside me and I thank yall for that. We all love you morgan
Girl that same shit happened to me when I lived by myself in Brooklyn. I’d have people visit, or I’d be on vacation and come back home, and then I’d be alone and I’d get SUPER depressed. Aaaand that’s why I started therapy hahaha.   It’s tough out there, but honestly thanks for sharing your experience. 💪🏻
Morgan you’re insanely gorgeous..you said no to a pair of jeans that looked so good on you!!! I’ve been going through the same as you...doing everything I can yet still feeling empty and unhappy...pls respond if you wanna talk about it. I’d love to just chat with you for a bit. I cried the entire last part of your video.  ❤️
oh my goodness im sorry that happened we love you morgan if you need to, take a break.
I feel you a billion percent. I loves yew Morgan. Hugss
I hope u feel better ❤️
baby, i hope you read this, i know it’s hard, but trust me, don’t live in the past nor the future, try to be present, we know you are a good and kind person and we love you💖
💕thank you for sharing and being vulnerable, it’s not easy to go through mental health alone. It was brave if you to share with the world 💕
My 26th birthday is on Friday and I couldn’t be less excited. I used to looooove my birthday. I didn’t like being the centre of attention EXCEPT on my birthday, I was birthday queen. But the last few years, my birthday has made me less and less happy. I know why I’m sad, and I also don’t know why I’m sad. It’s all confusing and it seems to never get any easier. Although we are different people and I don’t know what you’re specifically going through, I empathize with you Morgan (and anyone else reading) and you are definitely not alone❤️
*whole ass nip slip Morgan: should I wear this to the store right now?   I dont know why I found that hilarious 😂
Wait till your 30 sooo hard to make friends
Hi I don’t normally comment but I just wanted to say thank you for sharing what you’re going through and being real 💕
You have never looked more beautiful! You are glowing and look so healthy and that’s what is crazy about mental health. It doesn’t care about any of that. You can look your best and feel your worst. I am praying you come out the other side with more wisdom and clarity. Thank you for being real and putting out such relatable content! We love you just as you are!!
Omg I feel this so much... productivity is so hard for me. I had a baby in September I’m a single mom. I have a purpose now but at the same time I’m struggling with myself. I’m not happy with myself and I gained so much weight and now I don’t know how to get better. How to feel better.. Even tho I technically do know how to do it. It’s soooo hard..
I'm going through the same thing girl
Morgan I see you I feel what you feel every day too. You are definitely not alone. I love you so much. I wish we could meet and cry together. 😂🤗
This literally helped me feel like a normal person. I love your authenticity. Thank you
I feel like I'm watching a video about myself. Stay strong Morgan. Your deffinatly not alone.
What I would do to be Morgans best friend <3
Hi Morgan, I can tell you that’s exactly how I felt. I would go out with guys to feel something and be filled with what I thought was love. I felt that same emptiness you’re feeling. One day everything changed, I heard the Holy Spirit say “Look for it and you will find it”, I knew it was what I was looking for a Christian church, bcuz I was Catholic. I went to a non denomination Christian Church, gave my life to Christ, got baptized, and I was filled w/the Holy Spirit. Now that emptiness is gone and I’ve been set free from all (past, present, future) sins, i’ve been renewed, and restored and forgiven for all my sins, bcuz now I know that Jesus paid it for all of us on the cross. He loves you Morgan and he’s waiting patiently for you to go to Him, like he did with me. I hope this helped. Love u girl & Jesus loves you 💕
Morgan... I went through the same thing, one day I fell on my knees crying and prayed to God. I became numb and felt instant happiness. Jesus saves. I will pray for you
Thank you for sharing such raw emotions! I really think you should go back to Colorado.. I moved to another state and I loved it.. until I started feeling like you are in this video... I knew it was time to go home..and I never regretted it
I feel this entire video. Love you Morgan 💜 you’re not alone
if anyone leaves a shit comment on this video, eff you. Morgan, this sh*t is brave, to show the internet exactly how you're feeling and showing people the real situation going on. Another reason i love you and your channel. I'm praying to you get some mental clarity/peace soon :)
Wow I can relate and feel ur pain
I love you I wish we can be depressed together. I mean not really but I hope we both find our happiness cuz I feel you sister. Im in a state of heart break, but also in happy to be here?
This is so relatable right now, im here for you thank you for doing this
What helped me getting up the black hole that was eating me alive was God, I found strength in Him. If you aren't fond of a religion try to find something to fill that emptiness and start doing stuff because you want to, not need to to be normal or something like that. I am diagnosed with mayor severe depression and the road is not an easy one, but we can do it, because we deserve to be happy,  to be loved and to be our selves. Keep struggling,  keep fighting and be the best you can be for you not for anybody else. Respect yourself,  think in yourself more and stop thinking in others necessities because if you want to help out you can not do it if you are not ok. It's a ride on it's own but you can do it and you are not alone. Head up and looking forward alway. You are an amazing, talented young woman and you got all your life ahead of you to live. Stay strong.
I’m 39 and this is very relatable. Keeping moving Morgan, you’re Amazing!♥️
I’ve started loosing friends lately it sucks but ya gotta trust the process
If you need somewhere to donate clothing, I gotcha girl! Also I’ll be your friend. ❤️ I’ll send you a small on insta.
And then I'm here just wishing she had a depop. . .  Lol but it's so refreshing when people talk about their mental health and are honest about it! #stopthestigma  Also you're not stupid, and never say sorry for what you feel. We hear you and you're feelings are valid.
I’m really glad my moms taught me you don’t need friends  sounds like someone needs to tell you that
One way to help fight that empty feeling inside is to help give back to others. Volunteer somewhere. It’s super rewarding and fulfilling. Women’s shelters, food banks, elderly homes.
Thank you for being so vulnerable and open. You are not alone at all. And let me just say you look GORG in that red dress
Bro saaaaaaame! I can understand living in California is important. I really feel like you need to go to Hawaii and continue to blog your life there. This place seems mentally unhealthy for you.
Oh man this hit home today because I have been feeling this way for the past few weeks. Thank you for making this. I can tell you are a great person in and out. Hang in there!
Im legit crying! Im 31 and i feel like this ALL THE TIME! Its really hard to face the past and stuff that has happened to me. What makes all this worse is i am a mother to 3 kids..so i HAVE to pull myself together everyday so they can be happy and successful adults. My only goal is for them to live a fulfilling life! I feel like im failing every fucking day but i try with every broken piece of me. I love them sooooo much...they deserve more than me 💔
Morgan ty, I need this video, Ive been feeling like shit this days, I really feel so bad, Im not alone, ty
You seem as if you are at your happiest at home in Colorado, you can still do YouTube and what you do from there. Be wherever you are most happy! Do what brings you joy! Also I love I have watched you for years and this is my first comment and I just subbed ;P
Sounds like you need to stay away from soul cycle.
We love you
Girl I'm so proud of you for getting up and doing things when you don't feel up to it!!! I've always been one to isolate as a coping skill and my dad died on March 26th and I've been basically on my couch since then. I still go to work....but that's it. And I'm a mom of 4 so I like....I can't do that shit. Thank God my older children can hold it down somewhat...but they shouldn't have to. The funeral is this weekend so....wish me luck. I'm hoping that snaps me out of this shit.
I’ve had such a shitty day and needed to watch this to know I’m not the only one. Thank you Morgan ❤️
why was this so relatable , omg im not alone and your not alone . xox im sorry your going thur this mental health is always overlooked and made as a joke but it a real thing so many people deal with, thank you for sowing this vulnerable side of you, you are such a strong gorgeous girl. much love from florida.
Morgan: Whole drawer of shades, queen status.   Me: One pair of sunglasses
Girl today was horrible,
girl I feel you so bad.. I am feeling the same way. Everything is going so fast and you just feel overwhelmed by everything. You don't know what you want anymore. You just feel hopeless. I hope you will heal on your pace! You can be around people who care for you and whom you care.
She got famous and rich from Shane and now that everybody hates him and now that the money's dried up.... She's struggling. Ok.
Imagine the life you want & live that life!
Morgan. I love you so much. You’re so so strong. It’s okay to feel the way you do. You’re trying and that’s all that matters especially at these hard times in life I’m so proud of you. Keep on trying, you’re doing great :)
Omg i feel you , was struggling too like omg
morgan you look amazing!
I have never done soul cycle but it sounds like actual Hell on earth. Especially for an introvert with anxiety.
Love you 💕💕💕💕 you’re not alone hunny 🤗😊🥰
I need therapy 🤕 I need help figuring shit out
13:19 you look like T.swift from her belong to me music video at the beginning of it
Love you Morgan ❤️
I was a front row gal...only way I could focus. Otherwise, I’d just look for hot guys, look for outfits/shoes/bags I admired on girls  🤷‍♀️
Morgan. Babe. Through out the whole video I was in awe in how beautiful you looked. From the time you were trying on glasses, to eating breakfast, and when you were wearing the red top and jacket. Your skin is glowing, you have this gorgeous natural glow about you. I know you’re going through a rough time but I admire your vulnerability. I, myself am going through a rough time as well. I wanted to tell you thank you, for being an escape and I hope you don’t give up on your journey to happiness. You’re not alone girl.
Im sorry your struggling. Sending you hugs
watching this was like watching myself try to get through a depressive episode too :') you have a lot of good tools in your arsenal for managing depression symptoms and "down periods" and i think you did a good job trying to work through it like that!!
Literally going through the same thing right now.... glad to see I’m not the only one. Why are we like this 😳
Truthfully never have I ever felt so connected to a YouTube video. The last 7 days I’ve sobbed & haven’t felt this way in 5 years. What are the odds Morgan puts out a relatable video when I’m on the upswing. Lit.
Your are the most humble and amazing person and ALWAYS real. Im going threw the same, change is hard, but the future looks brighter.keep being YOU!!!!
thank you morgan for posting stuff like this cause this makes me feel like im not the only one feeling the same girll your not alone we all feel the same imagine me feeling the same just broke living alone trying to make ends meet
You’re so strong 💪🏻♥️♥️♥️
relating to this so much
Make you happy first. ❤️ LA sucks I feel for you.
Can we be friends? I’m just a random girl in Wisconsin but I feel the same way as you and understand what you’re going through.
Morgan, have u gone to a psychologist? A diagnosis might really help.
Can wr just talk about how good Morgan looks in red?!
Cry out to Jesus to be your Lord and Savior. He is the Living Water. He will be the only one that will satisfy you.
Yeah... I'm a back corner bitch too girl. That's why I can't go to those things, because things feel so forced. But thanks for the realness, it can get like that sometimes, no matter the circumstances. *hugs* <3
Whoever disliked this doesn’t have human emotions. I felt you so much in this video. I’m a car blogger and have been hoarding all these junk cars I don’t need anymore and won’t do anything with. You have given me the push in the right direction to sell them to build one good project😄 Keep it up, you’re doing great! I’m always here if you need to vent❤️
Morgan, thank you for sharing your authentic self with us. I was right there with you last week with my own mental health. It helps to know that I’m not alone. Thanks for being you 💕
“I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.” John 16:33  Praying that you will feel gods peace.
You need to get medicated Morgan. It’s a chemical imbalance. It doesn’t go away until you fix the imbalance
Love your brutally honest feeelings and reality and love you in the most not weird way ever! I’m a mom (33yrs old) of 4 littles (8,7,2 and 6mo) and I enjoy your vlogs SO much and maybe that in itself is weird but I relate and feel for you so much. You are doing SO much. Thanks for this, I needed these reminders and advice.
Thats a mood
Good for you for being open to everyone and normalizing mental health! Everyone goes through it but not everyone has the balls to talk about it. If you ever need a Michigan friend, I'm always down!!! We seem so similar 😁  Keep your head up and keep working on you ❤
Love you Morgan! We are all here to support you! ❤️
I think you went off medication and did your brain scan with that guy but have you been back to a real doctor and reevaluated? Depression is real and exercise and positivity and therapy helps but sometimes you need meds to help you along the way.💕
I have always learned something from you. Your perspectives, your vocabulary, everything about you was always so interesting to me.  you’re awesome! always wanted to be someone like you. humble, kind, and creatively smart.
Your not the only one girl!! Its such a constant battle. Thank you for being so raw and real it really helped me feel more validated that im not alone in this feeling either🌻
I’ve never wanted to give someone a hug so badly.  You’re not alone.  You are loved!
Morgan, you are very loved. I think you should move back to Colorado. You were so much happier there. Get outta LA.
Your the best
I’m watching this and thinking to myself “yeah, I feel that”  I honestly don’t think I’ve related to anything more than this in my life.
Hi honey lov ya
Why don’t you move to Tucson sis
The whole video I was thinking wow same. I was also thinking “omg she looks so pretty” lol
Morgan, I hope you know how appreciated you are. As a “ internet friend” you’re so relatable. Your a good person, and that’s easy to see and truly can tell you try to always be the best friend to anyone. Please don’t forget be a friend to yourself too. Struggles with depression/anxiety is hard all on it’s own but mix in being in a global pandemic and young 20’ s makes it so much harder to deal with. I’m so glad you are forcing yourself to get up and get moving when you really want to hide under the covers  that does really show growth there, and shows you are trying so hard to cope with things in a healthier way. So congrats to your progress. I remember living with alone and dealing with my depression sucked so badly so I completely understand where your coming from it wasn’t until I chased after goals and putting me first I noticed a change in the way I was feeling. I hope that your able to get ahead of struggles your feeling and I hope you never forget your important, your feelings are valid and you are not alone. Your internet family and I’m sure friends and family are here to support you every step of the way! I’m thankful to have you on the internet space I can relate too 💜💜
I say this with love because I dont want you to end up like me - 38 yrs old before you learn how to love yourself, and be happy and content on your own - not because you have no friends, or no love life, but because this is something everyone should be able to do. If you can't be happy and content by yourself your gonna find yourself in some seriously unhealthy f'd up friendships and relationships just because you are so extremely desperate to have someone - anyone.  And you DO NOT want to end up like that.  So seriously.....get into therapy, and actually take it seriously, and actually put in the hard work to dig deep and figure out exactly what the problem is that drives you crazy when you're on your own.  Because honey....you're young. You should be able to sit on your couch, alone in your home, and not get so anxious, stir crazy, and restless that you flee to a friend or family members home for a week.  Doing that is not normal, and you should really work on it before you get older, all your friends have husbands and kids, family gets busy, and you start turning to not so good ppl for company.  Just something you should really think about and consider.
Ok. Maybe I’m not alone 💕   You and I are so similar and I wish we could be friends. I love you and think about you and hope you have some peace and joy tonight 🦋
You’re not alone Morgan❤️ I relate to this so much
Maybe roommates would help?
1. Im sorry you are sad  2. Kitty hugs help  3. you look so good in jeans and the cute red outfit  4. I hold onto things too  5. I believe its just the way the world is right now it gives us all moments of despair
Holy shit you look good!
I feel so sad seeing you cry we never get to see this part of your life very much, thank you for talking about it because so many of us are going through the same thing, you're not alone. I remember you said you were thinking of moving back home to Colorado I honestly think that's the best thing you can do. LA is a hard place to live in and as glamorous as it seems living there doesn't equal success, go wherever you feel happy and remember that you have thousands of people out here who love you and support you!
Hey darlin’, you are so damn hard on yourself it makes me worried about you. You sound depressed and I wonder if you’re seeing a therapist. You are so beautiful, and talented, funny and smart. You have so much to offer, and I don’t think you realize it. Hugs 💙🐇
Lol @ Morgan thinking she is not one of the girls that everyone else wants to be. Morgan you are beautiful and funny and fun and smart and a literal ICON! I feel like I can speak for everyone when I say I wanna be youuuu! Keep on slaying ❤️❤️❤️ sending love! Quarantine and life have been shit, but keep on being your badass self. Appreciate you showing this side of things. We don’t always have to be perfect.
I know the part of her crying at the table is going to be a viral tiktok meme
Oh Morgan. Hang in there girl. I’m sending you hugs❤️🙏
We all love you Morgan!! Thank you for being real with us. This may be a rough chapter of life for you but remember it’s just that(: a chapter..time will tell all things just take it one day at a time. And eventually you’ll look around and be in a totally different place than you are now. Just remember, in order to move forward you have to continue to open new doors. Push yourself to grow and be uncomfortable. You’re doing so great girl don’t lose hope. You have so much potential to be your best self and I see you really working towards that. Don’t be discouraged you will flourish!!! I love you again!!!!! You go Queen!! You deserve the world!!
If I was in LA Id love to be your friend and let you cry on my shoulder :c You're amazing and sweet and you're gonna be okay soon! <3 <3
Thank you so much for being so real Morgan. You’re an amazing beautiful person and Sharing the ups and downs is so brave, as a girl with depression I really appreciate seeing this type of content 💖
THERAPY! I related to this more than any other video I've ever watched! I started going to therapy a few months back and believe me it was worth it!
The universe is helping guide you. But Houston. You are  sabotaging yourself. You are setting yourself up. You said in the beginning you knew all this crap was gonna come back. Lady you wrote your own life. Read the book The Secret. I know it's old now but seriously think about. If you 2nd guess or think about all the negative & waiting for the next issue thats all you're gonna get. You think you're lonely & miserable because you haven't found a man but thats all youre thinking about. You are putting all that out there. You need to start thinking you already have these things. Plan your future with the things you want already in your life. When you were at your parents were you happy did you feel things were getting better? What changed? When you were there were you thinking about all the negative or were you just being happy enjoying life. Stop focusing on negative or thats all you'll ever have.  Gratitude goes a long way too. Being thankful for the things you have and have experienced.  This may sound funny but everytime I get on an interstate I say thank you because there is no car or semi trying to run me over when I'm trying to merge on. And for many years now it has happened.  You are a great person I hope someday you can figure that out for yourself.
Not gonna lie , I cried with you Morgan . Your not alone xx
Sweetheart, you know the answer. JC
Love you Morgan!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love this video. It meant something to me. Thanks for being you.
Aw girl I’ll be your friend ❤️ hugs. I haven’t made a true real friend in a long time and it sucks pretty bad especially when you’re not feeling yourself.
Dang it. I wish I could call you. I so want to talk to you.
You know Morgan...have you had your apartment cleansed? Don’t take me as a weirdo I’m being genuine... I have seen and heard of spirits that mess with you. You guys already said the house was haunted... just saying... when you’re out of the house you feel so much better. It’s an idea... much love.
I am the older version of you
Life changing to know I'm not alone. This past year has been especially difficult for me and everyone else. We literally have to isolate to deal with this pandemic.. Had to take leave of absence from work because my mental health was exactly what you described... again, its amazing to know we are not alone by watching your videos. BUT you need to know you're not alone either. 💕💓
When you started crying I wanted to cry with you and just give you the biggest hug. I’m glad you’re doing better and I’m so glad you decided to post this video instead of ditching it. It really shows others it’s normal and okay to go through these things and feel the way we do and that no ones alone❤️
right now, i feel the exact same as you do. love you 🖤
It’s better to have a few quarters than a bunch of pennies. It’s better to have a couple of people in your life with more value than a bunch of people surrounding you worth 1 cent. This virus has been throwing everyone’s concept of time off, has forced us into isolation and to top it off there has been a harsh divide within our society. It’s been hard. We hear you and you’re not alone.
wanna struggle for real come do my shift at Mickey D's
You are so loved. I am 55 and am facing a lot of the same things. Please remember that you area valuable person and worthy of happiness.
Morgan can you send me the glass you said no too? Lol I’ll take all of them!
😢😢😢🥺🥺🥺🥺
Mourning the loss of another living person is one of the greatest pains. No one talks about breaking off a friendship but the pain is just as a raw as breaking up with a so.
Hey I know you feel like you got no friends but like homie we all your friends mostly everyone who clicks on these videos is a “fan”  lol hit us up when you need to be gassed up Frfr depression is fucked up I struggle with depression and an alcohol problem so I feel your black sheep pain girly stay strong
I can really relate to this. ❤️ Thank you for being so honest and allowing those of us who feel we need to hide the way we feel to be honest with ourselves and feel not so alone. Love you! ❤️❤️
To everyone who also relates to this video: Let's get better together :)
Girl.. you look GOOD. You’ve always looked good. But like, I can tell you’ve been doing your thing because you’re ✨glowing✨
Morgan this has literally been me the last two weeks. Every bit of it. Keep going. Thank you for being real 💖💖
I really enjoyed this video, and I thank you Morgan for putting it out there and not leaving it in your drafts. I too have the same feeling and I look at others as if they have no idea what I’m feeling or going through. But in reality we all going through it silently. I look at my friends and they seem happy and moving forward so I don’t want to burden them telling hill them how I feel and I should compare my life to them as we all one different paths. But it can be hard watching them walk a bit further while your still behind.   And like you said you still get up and try to do the things to make us “feel something” but it never does. And we give up easily. I’m glad your pushing through you have inspired me to also do a clean out because I also buy useless clothes and items.  Can’t wait for the next video 💚 give cookie a hug for me
Morgan, just wanted to say you’re beautiful !!!
Anyone else remember last year when Morgan poured wine into that dead plant and said “a little something to feel something, ya know?” Because I’ve said that every single day since then and I’m sad to see the dead plant go even though I know it’s for the best.   Love you, Morgan. You bring so much joy to our lives and it’s hard to see you sad. Take care of yourself and if you ever want to come stay at my cabin house in Utah, I have a spare bedroom and a cat that looks like Cookie. 💕 I promise I’m not a serial killer..... which i realize is exactly what a serial killer would say... idk I love you. Okay bye.
“ anyways do you wanna see my outfit tho??”   *me black out while venting/crying to my friends*
I feel like Sarah baska & Caitlyn Rae would be the best friend for Morgan💜
Morgan I want to hug you! I understand. We have so much in common. Do what you can every day. I don't know you personally but I'm 100% sure you are not a bottom feeder! Just know there are so many of us that Love you! 💜💜💜
Awwww Morgan I feel you! It’s definitely a change when going back to being by yourself and sometimes it’s hard! Because one moment you feel fine then the next you feel like you suck!
Totally had the most rough day, but tbh this vlog made me feel so much better. You're doing amazing, Morgan!! Thanks for lets us know we aren't alone.. xx
Morgan, I own a mental health awareness brand called Have Heart Co. and I am so thankful that you are always so open with your mental health. Our biggest goal is to breakdown the stigma that surrounds mental health. I would love to send you some shirts. Do you have a P.O. Box I can send it to?!
The only part of the day I actually enjoy is the hour before I go to sleep. I just lay in bed and watch some YouTube videos. Every day is a struggle. You’re not alone.
That empty place inside of you was created for God.  Only He can fill it.  The "universe" can't help you but God can...he created it.  Talk to God like you talked to your followers in your video.  He loves you more than you can imagine.  Just give Him a chance?
Anyone in LA want to be friends? Let's start a group or something.
someone down in the comments said to go out to activities instead of looking for friends... its so true.. find an activity that gives you joy.... then the right people will come to you because they feel the same joy in the activity... find the joy for yourself and the right people will come along because they are looking for the same thing.
I've never seen one person with so many sunglasses before! Thinking about you hun....don't ever compare yourself with others ...just find out what you want to do! I think you're a lovely human being.
Morgan- pool in your room Also Morgan- It’s called a bathtub  😂😂
first place
keep going girl we love you!
Sorry you're having a really rough time * hugs * ❤ ❤ but ..I understand.. im sorry I can't say some magical quote to make it better but thank you for sharing your troubles,  in a Era of ppl showing perfect lives, I appreciate some humanity ❤ much love
Maybe you could get a roommate it might help
This entire vlog is literally my entire life!
Morgan, my girl. I understand. While I have quite a few years on you, I totally get it. I'm married and have a child, but still totally get it. I want to tell you that it gets better, but idk if it does. We gotta hope it does, that's what keeps us going.
Move to Denver!!! QoL
If you struggle being alone you really need to find a hobby. Get into reading. Learn to knit. Take up painting. SOMETHING to fill your time and entertain you so you aren't just sitting around watchinf YouTube and feeling pointless.
morgan, we love and appreciate you so much. I wasn't gonna post this after seeing/liking all the other comments that basically say the same, but then I realized, even one more person saying it again can mean the world. That's what I would love if someone could do for me. So Morgan... YOU ARE LOVED, YOU ARE WORTHY, YOU ARE LOOKED UP TO, AND YOU ARE A FUCKING FIGHTER.
Move back to Colorado. You are so much happier there. LA is a soul suck. You need to be out of the fakeness and go back home.
I. Have. Never. Related. To. A. Video. More. Just went through trying my clothes on and purging them. Selling most of my stuff and leaving my apartment. Also have dead plants I just had to throw out 😂My anxiety is always at the worst in the evening and I could never figure out why. Better days ahead.
The greatest lesson I've learned so far is that you HAVE to be your own best friend! And I mean it with my whole heart that once you learn that your unstoppable!! 💯
You're a Human Honey, we're Not perfect because it doesn't exist, physically or mentally. Please remember that & how much everyone loves you! Hugs from New Orleans!!!
Morgan I have been there. Dark times seem like they’ll never pass. It affects you every waking moment of everyday and it is exhausting. But when it passes it is soooo freeing. You’re gonna reach that freedom soon ❤️
Ive been "waiting a few days" for 15 years.
I'm in my mid 20s and I really don't mind living alone. I don't have many friends that I constantly see, only once in a while. It's not for everyone though. Do what makes you happy. LA is not for you it seems. You can move back home for a while and figure it out.
I love you🥺💕 every time I watch your videos you make me so happy
Sending love ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I sure love you, Morgan.  Something that helped me was finding the one thing that I loved to do that I could work at and be good at.  It was life-changing.  You have a naturally artistic aptitude for design.  Your sensitivity is the artist in you.  I love you and always look forward to seeing your vlogs.  You're precious.
I totally feel you! 😔... im praying for better days
Seems like there alot of people struggling with just eveyday life like whats going on
100% relate lately. Stay strong, Morgan ❤️
I just want to give you the biggest hug, because same 🥲
Everything will be ok ❤️❤️
I feel your pain so much. I cried thru it all with you. My life used to be full of coworkers in an office answering strangers' calls all day, friends to hang out with often, a fair amount of family I was close with, a small child at home and in a relationship with his father. Now I work from home, have no coworkers, friends have moved on, my child is older and couldn't care less about me, I only have my dad now but he lives hours away and is always busy, and his father and I haven't been together in years. Then pandemic hit.... My car broke down Feb 2020 and I haven't been able to afford to fix her and also no one can figure out the issue too. So I've been stuck, in my house for over a year. I babysit kids so I chat with my parents here and there but otherwise, I have no adult interaction. With anyone. I could probably count the amount of times I've left my house on my fingers and toes. No one ever texts me, calls me, nada. I usually have to initiate convos. And like you, I feel I'm a good person. I'm too empathic tho. It too makes me very sentimental, hang on to the memories of a big family growing up, lots of friends and things to do but now. Nothing and no one and it's a hard fkn pill to swallow. I'm also trying to find me way out of this darkness
thank you for this. I always go through moments like this so im grateful youre sharing this.
Morgan...this makes my heartache.  Please be patient with yourself.  You do not need to figure everything out all at once, you do not have to be everything to everyone...that includes yourself.  Be easy sweet heart, thank you so much for sharing & being open.    Please reach out if you ever need to and do it over and over...you will get through this, you are a light in this world even if you do not know it.
Awe!!!! I want to hug u so bad. Let's just hug it out! I'm feeling like this too
So glad you are back! Back row bitch yes queen!! Lol I’m just 65% ok.
ugh  I understand this on SUCH a deep level right now. I moved away from my family because I wanted to create a life for myself. I had an amazing first year away, but then my bf broke up with me, my best friend moved away, and then COVID hit and all my friends are either too busy or struggling with their own stuff and I feel so alone on the other side of the country from the people I love. It's hard when people say "oh just move back" because I don't want to move back. I want to create my dream life here because it feels like home, it's just missing some big pieces. I've been trying so hard to be my best self but nothing quite seems to fall into place.  I'm good by the way, I just have moments, just like Morgan.
Morgan I need you to know if you were just sitting in your bed all week long and just vlogged that I would still watch it’s your personality’s d you as a whole that makes me love your videos. So don’t be so hard on yourself! ❤️ love you praying for you
I just wanted to cry with you.
Wish I could give you a big hug ❤️ just know you aren’t alone and we all appreciate you.
It’s insane to see how much you’ve grown. You seem so much healthier both mentally and physically. You radiate such a positive and hopeful energy now!
Colorado needs you. You should go take care of Colorado. You already know where the boxes are at Home Depot and you've already purged your closet. The battle is half way done. If you can't justify moving home any other way, do it for Colorado.
I needed this today, I needed to know that I’m not alone that I’m not crazy for thinking I don’t fit into this world. Today I didn’t cry alone thank you Morgan. We can do this
Thank you for being you and for being vulnerable. I hear you, I see you, and I understant. Keep fighting girl you got this. <3
Love you Morgan. Its so tricky to see so many people every day that are “normal”, that don’t struggle with depression or anxiety. Im trying to figure out how to kick alcoholism. Life is so hard but we have to show up, be accountable and try. Hope you all that are struggling find your healing and growth
Morgan, if I still lived where I used to, which was a two hour drive from LA, I would be offering to be your friend. And tell you that I would meet you at the bookstore, or Starbucks, and let you get it all off your chest. And then we could bitch about traffic. And show each other a million pictures of our cats.
Hey Morgan, I just want to say that I’m so sorry it’s been so hard for you. I struggle with mental health stuff myself and it freaking sucks. But I know the only way I’m able to smile and go forward is because of my relationship with God. I really suggest you find a church to  seek out Him. This isn’t a judgment type of thing I’m trying to do, but I truly believe that faith in Him is what all this hurt is trying to make you realize.   Or Worth can’t be found in the universe, or friends, or accomplishments, or location, it can only be found in the One who created us since He is the author of our stories.   I’m more than happy to help if you want, but please know that I love you and that Jesus loves you to where He died and rose again for everyone and that includes you :)
Baby Girl you're still young and I know the feeling like everything is falling around you but trust me you'll find your footing and your circle of friends who will love you for you. It's the quality than quantity. As you get older the less Fs you give of how others think of you. Plus you're further accomplished than most at your age. Please do not let social media and the "LA lifestyle" change you or break you. You're far more unique, kind, and beautiful inside and out than those you may compare yourself to. Know you are loved. Imma pray for you mama 🌺💖🌺
This video broke my heart. You deserve the best. You video made me want give you hug. I’m glad you are feeling better.

Ugh I feel this!  I tend to ignore and suppress my feelings.  And then one day I just sort of explode over something small and cry for like a week randomly.  This video reminded me of myself in that way.  Girl, you can vlog and make videos anywhere.  Honestly most of the LA based youtubers I enjoy are literally production companies (Rhett and link, smosh, try guys).  My fav vloggers, commentary channels, whatever are all over the place.  LA only seems relevant if you’re trying to collab with a fuck ton of people.  And girl you’re doing just fine on your own with your fam!  And if you ever wanna come to Ohio-I’m no one but I could use a friend to do dumb shit with 😂😂
Please make an appointment with a psychiatrist!! Please please!! Always reach out.
Sending you love and growth vibes! 💚 You can do this and you ARE doing it! It's okay to have bad days, just get back up babe! 💚
you posted this today and i got kicked out and i have no idea where i’m gonna live.  i feel you
Sorry you are feeling this way. I haven’t been to a restaurant in over a year; I haven’t been out anywhere except the essentials. I work from home with my toddler. I have had a couple friends ghost me because I chose to put my child’s needs and safety above them waiting to go against C-19 restrictions. 😓
Thank you for this. I feel less alone.
I get so in my thoughts when I'm alone and it's hard to break the isolation cycle once those thoughts begin. Love you ❤️
your so so pretty
❤️ I just want to give you a massive hug ❤️
who asked
My darling... you have a Peleton... they don’t yell shit like that at you. Don’t go back into the world like that when you have a bazillion dollar machine like that at home
Never felt a vlog more in my 30 years than this one.
Most relatable vlog so lonely take care morgan
it gets better trust me, i was there for so so long! i promise things will turn around one day and you get stronger along the way
Ok hi I would like to be your friend and give you the biggest hug ever after this video. Hit me up and I’ll move in with you 🤗💕
Your cat looks exactly like mine
Stay strong!!💞💞💞
Egg with tears.. yummy!!   Big hugs Morgan. We are like the moon.
you go Glenn Coco
Hang in there 🥰
this was sooo REAL!! and why you’re one of my favorites 🤍
With everything you said, I felt it on a spiritual level. I have been feeling the same way since my mom and grandpa died 2 days after one another in February. My ex dumping me after my mom's rosary. Nothing feels right. I feel empty and depressed. And you venting helps me understand that I'm not alone. Thank you so much for talking it out with us, Morgan. 🖤
Morgan, depression is a hard demon to face. The sun is shining, everything seems like it's ok but inside you feel empty. I recommend finding a therapist, counselor, or another mental health specialist to guide you through this. Sometimes we need a little extra help and that is ok!
In 2012 my husband and I moved to AZ from CT. I absolutely hated it. My job was awful, as well. The two scenarios put me in a mental place that I can only describe as a black pit. I COULD NOT function. I was working full time and trying to get my bachelors, too. I had a complete mental and psychological breakdown. Many people don't understand how an environment can truly impact you. You definitely need to leave CA, it is not for you and that is ok. You are not doing anything wrong. Go back to CO and heal your mind. We all support you ♡
Keep fighting Morgan. You're so strong. I love you and thank you for normalizing these kids of thoughts and these feelings. Keep fighting.
Just be yourself, you can see in the comments that everyone likes you. Don't worry about the "popular girls"  I love weirdos and most of us are. Don't worry.
I love you so much Morgan. It's okay to feel this way ♡
God is obsessed with you, Morgan! You're so loved <3
Dang... i hope you’re okay.
Its a mental breakdown...     ..down down break it down 💅✨💃
Morgan saying “no” while trying on clothes while I’m yelling “yes girl!” at my screen.
I want everything in her video!!!
Morgan I'm reading a book called "your resonant self"... it's neuroscience that anyone can understand and it's the only book I've read that makes sense of .... everything I've ever wondered about why I am the way I am. I can't recommend the book enough.
You’re so beautiful Morgan!!! Watching your vids always make laugh and smile!
I can’t even afford any of her sunglasses 😂
Morgan, you are great! I’m 47 years old and I love watching your vlogs. Please don’t ever change. I love your energy.
watching as I’m having my own mental breakdown thanks morgan 👌🏻🤪
Definitely can relate to what she is going through especially now. Try to be nice to yourself it’s clique but really important. Hope you feel better Morgan 🥰
Thank you SOOOOOOOO much for sharing this!!!!!!
When you started crying, I did too 🥺 hope you feel better mamas! This vlog is so raw, I love it.
I relate so much, I’m at college rn and have literally 0 friends and it’s very hard but focus on the ppl and support systems you have
Morgan- thank you for sharing this. you’re not alone any more when someone understands, and I thank you for that, thank you for being you and honest. 🤍🤍🤍🤍
I love you and my heart is so sad for you. Finding friendships is hard shit and loyal ones to boot...Much love to you from Ohio. Here for you love!!
Morgan you need to either get a room mate or move back to Colorado and live with family or friends . Living and being alone makes me feel like shit too
hang in there girl ♥
Sweetheart, maybe you should move home for a bit. Get your bearings, center yourself, be with family.
Thank you for this, it’s hard to admit to ourselves that we’re depressed specially when some don’t understand how we’re feeling. I appreciate your vlogs!
Also I’ll take you clothes I’m broke as fuck
I honestly just think it’s not a good time for anyone . I recently broke my wrist and my rib , ontop of that I have a jaw problem I need to pay $15,000 to get fixed , I am learning to do things one handed lol , my boyfriend is depressed , I have hundreds of dollars of bills  . I mean it’s just not a good time 🙃 I get fake eyelashes today so let’s hope if I look prettier things go better 🤣
I loveeee you! ♥️♥️ lol i feel you
Oh Morgan, you are not alone  ! You described my life . Just keep swimming , just keep talking
Awe that sucks you feel so empty!! personally for me, my faith in Jesus helps me be at peace, but it doesn't mean things don't just suck in this world. I haven't been to therapy, but I feel like it could also be an option!!  I hope things get better for you!!
Maybe you should move back to Colorado. Your support system is there and you’re happier and that’s what life is about
I 100% understand where you're coming from. I just decluttered 5 years worth of clothes from my bedroom 2 weeks ago after going through a really tough breakup to somehow helped with the clutter inside my head, and it kinda made everything easier to cope with.   Depression is a bitch, and the low days are defiantly low. Keep fighting for those high days, you're going to be ok. We're in this together <3
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Aw Morgan I’m so sorry your going through all of this you are an amazing and strong person I love you and your videos always even though you may not see this but I care💖 I’ve tbh been in a similar boat with just getting down about my work then I belittle my own feelings and just have the worst luck recently and been feeling alone like the point where even though I’m home with parents I still feel totally alone. Also I’ve always wished I could actually be friends with you I’ve been struggling with the whole friends thing too
🙏🏼❤️
Tell Trinity to come visit you soon. You guys are great together.
Morgan I completely feel you, I havent ate or gotten out of bed in 3 days. I'm mentally and emotionally drained. But you and your videos always help, thank you!
I don't think you realize how much of an amazing impact you sharing this with us has. From the outside it's so easy to assume people are doing great, but that's not always the case. Thank you for sharing what you've been going through. This definitely has helped me and I'm sure many others. I hope you see the light at the end of the tunnel soon.   XoXo
Honestly, idk how how you’re vlogging and going to school at the same time like I’m in school and can’t imagine putting focus into anything else rn. Give yourself a pat on the back girl!
I just love all of your vlogs! everyone of them just has a deeper feeling but somehow makes me so happy and enlightened.
Morgan...you are the light of my day. You are so pretty and fun to be around for sure. You are definitely someone I can hang out with on a daily. Your subscribers love you!
I'm still worried about  that eye problem she was having, do you guys know if she did go to a neurologist?
Yes- walk away from the toxicity. I’m 31 and have done it so many times. Trust your gut.
I had to get off social media because I couldn’t handle trying to keep up with everyone and always being happy and perfect!  Comparing myself all the time was really weighing me down and starting to really wreck havoc on my brain.  It’s by far the best thing I’ve done in a long time!
It sounds like you need to be with some family and friends. Maybe you need to move back home for a little bit or find a Roomate. I had some depressing and lonely times when I lived in my own place without family living in the state. My most favorite time was living with my mom when I was 29. I was never ashamed of it. You are so young and have time to figure out what you want to do with you life. Life is too short to be unhappy!
morgan you inspire me and i am so proud of you
I literally feel like that plant you threw out inside.  I've turned into a misanthrope being around a big family that always likes going out and doing things, I'm a loner and an introvert and being pushed into this Brady bunch crap for 4 years has really messed me up. I crave solitude but its like I'm stuck in this hell of happy go lucky people.
I feel this. Also when i try and declutter my room and dump all my clothes on my bed I get so overwhelmed that i cry. Do one draw at a time. That's my advice on that, can't give any advice on anything else. Sorry babe.
I think it's almost like a ptsd thing. When last year happened and we were in quarantine so drastically, it was alot and a huge adjustment. And now things are opening up, and we see family, friends, etc. And then when we're left alone, we may not realize it but we're like uhhh yep, it's happening again. It's alot. Hang in there friends. We'll get through this.
i love you ❤️
Stay strong Morgan. Shoutout from Long Beach, California :)
I wish I could be your friend in real life lol. I relate to you so much! I hate being alone but I love it and when I'm depressed I get so blah I hate it lol. I do love watching your videos and look forward to them!!
Get moldivite
dang you in this vlog has been me for the past 3 days but I can proudly say I felt pretty okay and good today and no crying which is progress :) we're all get through it.
I love that you post videos like this Morgan, I’ve been dealing with some depression a lot recently and it was really nice to see that I’m not the only one
Wow! You are so inspirational and I’m sure you don’t believe it but dang it girl, it takes guts to say these things. One wish I have for you is to see yourself the way your audience sees you. Have a good day.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
We love you 💜
I've been feeling like I've been in a funk too ever since this corona thing happened. I hope things bet better for you Morgan and your mental health improves
Are her and trinitee still friends?
The lady that says “you are bottom feeder” thats her. I believe when one says something bad to someone thats literaly her or him.
I love you. You’re not alone. ❤️
this genuinely helped. i feel so bad rn
Morgan u r loved!! Anyone reading this, u r loved!!
love you 💕
I'm glad that you're so open about your mental health and struggles, it truly allows people like me to sit down and understand that I'm not alone in this world- that I have people in this world that are fighting the same demons every day. I want you to understand that you are doing absolutely amazing, you are working through your problems and fighting to be better every day and you should be so proud of yourself. I think it might be best for you to move back home to Colorado, every time you go back to L.A you struggle, and you shouldn't have to live with that Morgan, L.A is a very toxic place to live and you really don't need that suffocating you. Just remember that we are here for you❤️
This was honestly posted at the right time for me bc I’ve been having so many panic attacks and mental breakdowns the past couple days so like I feel ya girl and thanks for letting me know I’m not alone in these garbage feelings
Depression feels
honestly honey it sounds like you have a depression anxiety disorder like me ik exactly how you feel I have been feeling it too badly lately
I promise everyone is going through it, but it will get better! Go through the process and find your happy... we adore you!
Us and are cat's when we get sad.
Never felt more understood by someone I follow. Morgan is the most relatable and sweetest person on youtube.
You explained this perfectly. I feel this with you
THANK YOU!! this is the most relatable thing I've seen in 2021 ❤️❤️❤️ you're a QUEEN 👑❤️
Love u Morgan ❤️
Thank you for making this video!!!
Why does this just sound like we should all leave LA cause same ... maybe I need to leave LA
Wow Morgan red is your color! That red dress looked so good
this video made me tear up because i can relate, love you morgan!
I love you Morgan!!!! You’re amazing 🤩
Bro ily if you need sisters my sister and I can be your twinssss or cousins lmao I love you so much Morgan
I cried myself to sleep last night and I’m 25. I feel you girl, Let’s just keep moving forward at the end it will be worth it and we can all laugh about it someday, hopefully in a near future 🤍
You certainly aren’t alone. It is incredibly difficult to make friends as an adult. It’s even more difficult to do that during a pandemic. It’s a break through, not a break down! I love that. Thank you for your virtual friendship Morgan. I wish you all the happiness in the world.
We love you, Morgan.  Keep moving forward, you've got this. <3  Team Ketchup & Eggs!
Same, sis, same. Thank you for the video! ❤️💫
I felt this so hard...god damn
never feel stupid for feeling things morgan ❤️
Hard relate. I hope things will improve for you.
Been there, am there, am Morgan. I think it would be good for you to move home for awhile to collect yourself and restart. LA will always be there. I had to do this and find myself again. Don't let anyone shame you for doing what's best for you. Your life is yours, no one else's opinion matters. <3
I've had a similar experience with feeling better, then being thrown back into feeling like shit. It sucks so much, because now you know what its like to feel good. I'm rooting for you!
the way....i feel......the same way??? who knew.
Morgan! I cried when you cried, you are wonderful and so funny, stay strong through the hard moments and remember that people love you always <3
Understand you completely. Your not alone. I been watching your videos for some time now and consider you as my friend.you have a lovely funny family and I know they love you so so much!
Change is so hard!! I hate it!!!  You are amazing, beautiful, kind and wonderful.  Take your time, do what makes you happy. I love watching you and thank you for being so real, you don't get that with many people and that is why you are so relatable!!!  Love you and keep working through this, it will get better.
Wish you lived in my state so we would be friends girl!!! Ughhh you are so amazingggg!
Big piece of advice one of my coworkers once gave me is that the universe never sends signs that are meant to hurt you. Try and remind yourself that and reframe what’s happening to something positive bc you’re worth it
Dude she is so fucking beautiful inside and out. Morgan you deserve happiness and you definitely will find it, thank you for being so honest and vulnerable <3
this vlog should be called "going through a spiritual awakening" and that's nothing to laugh or make fun of its something to be proud of, look at all of the growth you made. I'll be your friend <3
Morgan...  girl,  if you need a friend..... HELLO! 👋 my name is savannah. I'm 21 and live in ohio.  I struggle to make friends because I work too much,  and Im a little sad sometimes 😂🤣😂🤣 much love to you. I hope you can find the place you belong,  the place that holds your happiness and healthy mental status.
The most relatable thing posted since 2020
Sweetheart.... I’m a 50 yr old mother of 4 what has seen a few things in life and my heart pulls towards you because when I was in my 20’s... I was very similar to your personality... here’s the truth... you are scared to take responsibility and truly branch off on your own.  Your parents make it very easy to come home and be loved.  Time to pull yourself up by the britches and mature and make boundaries with family... even though of course they love you endlessly but they make it wayyyy to easy to just give up because they are your security blanket.  Have you made any girlfriends?  Obviously talking to a camera is not a friend.  You have the biggest heart that will draw you to the right people.  Maybe volunteer at church?  College?  You will find yourself.  Life is hard and uninteresting but if you stop worrying about yourself and focus on others I promise you life will become fulfilled.  Tooooo much time on your hands can be very dangerous to the soul.
wow this really got me RIGHT together
We can be friends I feel that way to love you girl
Looks like your doing keto .. do you need a keto partner from Illinois to keep you on track .. I can be your keto partner
we love you morgan <3
I was literally feeling this last week where I was going in and out of being happy. Trying to cover up how I was really feeling..I was feeling physically sick ..it was more spiritual..I thought I literally was loosing my future in those moments.
don't feel bad about not screaming or being loud in the class. I am literally the same one of the instructors knows me and will scream my name in the middle of class and I'm just like no please no! lol And that lady was mean for not taking into consideration some people just aren't loud or want to be doesn't mean were "bottom feeders"!
this is why i watch your videos, because your real. Stay true to yourself and love & light shall shine through 💕 wish you nothing but the best
What kinda tea are you drinking out of your mason jar ??☕🍵🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Morgan ♥️😭  this was such a relatable video, and I’m thankful you’re sharing. I have had all of these exact moments too in my really dark seasons, and felt so many emotions watching this video. I hope you know there’s nothing stupid or “wrong” about how you’re feeling. It’s so easy to blame ourselves, but depression, anxiety, and mental health battles are not a result of something wrong or bad about you (or me!) I’m glad you have such a strong family support. I’ve found a lot of relief in therapy and sometimes medication in the past two years as I’ve been working through my brain things (I know that’s not for everyone and you’ve had some battles with meds as you’ve shared). I just wanted to share support, because I know I can’t fix this for you, but as a fellow suffering human, I was wishing I could while I watched!!   Ultimately, I hope you’re kind to yourself in these battles and continue to remind yourself that the bad feelings pass. I was worried about you watching because there was such visceral pain here. Please hang in there any remember you’re so valuable, worthy, and loved.   Just felt the need to say all that. Wishing you well ♥️
Morgan I can relate so much and it helps me to see that other people go through similar things too. 🖤🖤🖤
Sharing how you are feeling with your depression is incredibly strong ❤ it's extremely important for us all to express how we are feeling. Any change is insanely hard and life is cruel. You are so thoughtful, beautiful, honest, funny, and just so damn wholesome. I wish you the best Morgan
It’s okay not to be okay. Do what makes you happy Morgan
I literally relate to everything you’re going through right now❤️
Well done for speaking out and voicing how you are feeling, you will help so many to open up and can relate to you, I really hope you find your path, I've had a s**t 2 years keep trusting the universe I've kept trusting it, its finally listened to me this year and my stars have aligned this year much love ❤
needed thank i appreciate this thank you
1:22-1:29 same 😂😂
You’re so beautiful!!
u're an icon morgan. never forget it bestie
This wasn't supposed to hit so closed to home.
i just wanna give morgan a big hug:(((
I feel this on every level
This video is so relatable, thank you for making this. It made me feel like I'm not alone <3
By any chance does this happen once a month?
Girl I’m 36 and I still have these existential crisis all the time!!! Plus your brain is still healing from coming off those meds! Be gentle on yourself!! Ummmm that red dress and white jacket 👩‍🍳 😘
That’s called depression
Hey girl, sometimes you gotta live with your mom and it's ok.
I really hope Morgan's still friends with Andrew and Garrett, I love their positivity and I think people who radiate that type of energy are good people to be friends with
Morgan trying not to cry while saying "it's fine" has been the mood for the past year I sware
That is why I never join that kind of class where you have to be social lol,they should realize there are people that is not comfortable interacting with strangers and THATS OKAY
This vlog is so relatable. Being aware of your mental health is so important. You're very strong! I, too, am adjusting of being alone after 3 years straight, its quite difficult but I know I'll get thru it and come out stronger. Same applies to you!   Take everyday one day at a time.
Depression is real and you’ve done a great sharing your story. It will help so many people. Move back to Colorado!  Your best support system is there.
Oml you're are such a pretty crier🥺 Everything will be okay you've got this! We all have a hard time sometimes and sometimes more than others you aren't alone❤️❤️
We need to see another Morgan and Trinity adventure!
I want to be your friend. I need someone like you in my life. Keep putting out the positive vibes Morgan. I feel  it.
I feel defeated and empty from time to time and I’m 32. It seems unfair and not worth it, but the beautiful moments outweigh the bad days. I feel empty and lost at times, but I did find myself in the process. We ALL LOVE YOU MORGAN!!! 🤗 💋 💕
Big hugs
I think you should leave LA and move to NY
I don’t know why that soul cycle story made me laugh so hard!!! I guess I’m a bottom feeder? Lol
15:17 agreed. birds are terrifying
Thank you for being so brave and vulnerable and bringing this to the light. You reminded me that none of us are alone in feeling this way. Love you 💖💖💖 my heart goes out to you.
It's a weird feeling knowing your not the only one dealing with the same thoughts.
Sending you so much love my dear. I empathize and understand the space your in more than you know. ✌🏾❤️
Thank you for being raw and real
Totally relate to everything you said in this vlog. Take care of yourself Morgan, sending loving positive vibes your way 💕 xxx
Relatable video of 2021 goes to
I love you Morgan you’re so freaking strong
morgan we are here for you! 🥺 thank you for sharing your emotions with us. this is why i’m subscribed. no one wants to watch someone faking a perfect life. this is REAL life. and girl red is your color for sure ❤️
Thank you for this.
You ARE a good person and out out awesome, amazing energy into the world. 💕💕
I feel like you should check out @daradubinet’s channel and have a consultation with her and maybe try to set it up as a collaboration about your north node and where you should be or where are you will be your most productive and happiest.
Morgan I wish that you saw in you what we see and love about you. You are incredible, hilarious, beautiful and I wish we were real life friends. Sending much love xoxo Also you look fucking amazing damnnnn gurl love you in red. P.S friends are overrated
We can be grateful for and long for the life we've had, but we have to let it go to be able to accept a new life and new blessings. It sucks to lose friends, but your family is there for you. Los Angeles culture sucks... I hope you can find a good circle for yourself again
Coming from a 40yr old, you are doing just fine. You're on the right track. I know it sounds cliché but just take one day at a time and work on the little things, like decluttering. Where you are meant to be will find you. <3
I’ve been feeling the exact same way :/
Morgan, you are such a kind and original spirit. thank you for your content and for being you!
I want to be pals so so bad :) I've been going through the same thing of growing and changing and putting positive energy out and not receiving it in return. then I realized it was where I was and what I was doing wasn't surrounding myself with those of the same vibe, goals, and mindsets. Your work will pay off sista
I saw “breakdown time” and couldn’t click fast enough lol life’s been rough for all of us lately bby girl and we all want to be your friend so don’t feel alone ❤️
Can we see Trenidy I love her
I love you and your content Morgan and so do a lot of people! Keep being you 🤍
We all know how you feel, this past week has made me very emotional and I’ve been told it’s okay to not be okay. Do what’s best for you no matter what the situation is.. you have made my day and I appreciate you so much🥺♥️
Morgan... SAME💜
You are not alone ❤️
So relatable
I'm in tears. We're exactly the same person, I'm just a little older. Going through TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS right now....man.
i think you'd be happier living around your family and you already have lifelong friends back home too. if you hate the winter weather you could just leave during the winter (except holidays) and be there the rest of the year. idk i think you should do what makes you happiest and be wherever that is too, and if there's things stopping you try to find accommodations  for them that you can live with. i truly hope you feel better soon, you're doing everything right.  keep on keepin' on<3
Let's take a moment to celebrate that you cleared the things out and you boxed it up! That is huge! You are seeing it through!! 🎉
You REALLY need to go back to Colorado with your family <3 <3 <3
This is going to be a very, very unpopular post...BUT...Now try being alone while going through chemo, 5 surgeries in 2 years, and radiation for breast cancer.  I was totally alone going through all this and still didn't cry this much!  You have the choice to move, that you can work anywhere!  Either pick up and move or learn to deal with it!  If you're not happy, YOU are the only one who can change things!
Big loving hugs hon, you are such a sweet and beautiful soul! Love you! ✨💝
Thank you for being so vulnerable Morgan. Trust me we all feel you girl. Having an animal definitely helps when you’re feeling down! My cats help me cope so much
Thank you Morgan 💕
I wish so badly I could be your friend. I just feel like everything you were describing I was like same same same. 😭😭😭 plus you really do have such a good vibe. Adult hood is fucking hard with making friends and adjusting and this time period of early 20’s just has SO many changes
I know exactly how you feel... my best friend/almost sister cut me out of her life... it sucks but I found myself in the process 💕 I love you, M❤️rgan!!!
“Just wait a few days” MORGAN ITS BEEN 2 YEARS FOR ME 😭😭😭😭
“Jeans that I’ve been waiting for the past two years to fit that’ll never fit” ...BIG same.
This video is a reminder to all of us to be kind to others. There's no reason to put down a stranger if they're not hurting anyone, you don't know what they're going through
i thought i was the only one that felt this way, i feel better knowing i’m not alone
I’m 100% convinced that it’s impossible to live a happy life in LA. Every person that lives there is only worried about social media and social status. Move on with your life love! You will be happier!
I cried with you Morgan 😭 I relate so much
this is the exact headspace i’ve been in for the past few weeks and it makes me feel better seeing someone else going thru it
Morgan can we be friends please!?
Ok but are you poshmarking your sunglasses cuz all your no’s were so cute 🤣
Love you, Morgan!!!
I am in your exact situation especially the friends thing. I think it is because you and I are the same age so that is why I relate to you a lot. I actually had a mental break down last week about it. And this video made me feel not alone. Don’t worry Morgan, it gets hard first but watch. Your life is going to be amazing by the end of this year just you wait🤍
Morgan, I just wanted to take a moment to say how brave and awesome you are for putting yourself out there with this video. I am going through something so similar and it’s been such a hard journey. I moved to Hawaii with my boyfriend 3 years ago. A year in he broke up with me and was engaged within 6 months of our breakup. I’m all alone here in Hawaii. I work from home, have no friends, all of my friends/family is back on the east coast and literally do everything by myself. I feel like I’m a good person and feel like I put myself out there but meeting people has been truly difficult. I struggle every day with what the hell am I doing with my life and why am I so alone. I have months where I’m really thriving and then months where I feel like I crash and burn and can’t leave my house. I just turned 30 and my existential crisis with myself has become even worse. Just know you are not alone girl! Stay strong we got this!
Girl you need to speak to a medium and get in contact with your spirit guides. You’re never alone, none of us. ✨🌈💖
Morgan I love you 🥺
The ending especially when she was talking about like how she was going to go out and have fun yet like still crying. I really felt
You are very self-aware and embody an amazing energy! Your going places in life, just not the direction you think. Thank you for sharing.
Ugh girl also going through it. You inspired me to go through my clothes, I've been wanting to for awhile and you gave me the motivation
I love Morgan but she just described depression for 20 minutes. Privilege doesn't mean that she should be happy just because but sis, you need to put some serious money and time into getting help. I have crappy insurance, I get 2 psych visits a YEAR. She's so incredibly smart, she knows toxicity abounds in LA, stop going back there when it leads to your eggs being too salty because you're crying into them!
Thank you for sharing Morgan, this was so relatable. I needed to see this <3
Morgan is so beautiful inside and out. She is literally a good person who deserves the best..
Morgen i swear you are finding your purpose right now. What said about having a good time with friends but still feeling empty is true.
Omg, I love you in a friendship way. Talk about a slap in the face!
Morgan, thank you for this. I can feel myself going into a spiral and I needed this. It was so genuinely nice to see someone I admire going through it but being okay. Thank you
Morgan...do you have a post office box? I think you should get a P.O. Box and accept letters from fans. You don't even know how much I felt you on this. 😔💜  I love what you do. I love your personality. I love the way you FUCKING LOVE GRANDMA!!! You are beautiful and fun. 💚 NEVER STOP BEING YOU. 🌸🌻🌼🌺🌻 Thanks
Finally getting to see more of you❤ thank you for being real.
I genuinely want to be friends with all of you. We’re all going through it 😩
Therapy Time. I have a lot of the same feelings. Hope you feel better.
Remember Morgan sometimes things aren’t  falling apart, they are falling into place. 🥰❤️🥰
Omg that screaming bottom feeder woman, do you want me to speak to their management because I will. What a selfish person, expecting everybody to be exactly like her.
Morgan hun I'm sorry your having a hard time! Have you ever thought about a roommate ?
Thanks for keeping this so raw, but at the same time I'm really concerned. It's good to know that you've seek help and are in a good place now.
This is exactly what i feel
Your not alone!
Morgan you are beautiful and glowing, and your doing your best.  Your also beautiful and a kind funny soul on the inside. But, sometimes you have to go through the motions and then your inner self will catch up. If you had my friend she would be cracking you up so much you wouldn’t have time to stop laughing.  Laughing laughter is the best medicine.
Can I suggest you find a really great therapis!  I realize you are anti medicine but I think maybe you need something. I must say though you are so very strong!  Don’t forget!  You are amazing.
honestly i can relate to this video so much!  this is what im going through since the whole pandemic started & as much as i say it's getting better it's really not.. but i prey that all bad things happening to wherever is reading this that we get through it! ❤️✊   i love you lots morgan as a fan & i really hope you get though it day by day ❤️💙💛
Sending light and love 😟🌻
I feel this way often. It’s very hard. Thank you for making me feel like I’m not alone
“Too high-waisted” is a phrase that doesn’t exist in my vocabulary
awww omg i love you so much!!!! you`re literally my fav !!! you had me crying with youuu
Human emotions! So refreshing.
Gosh my heart goes out to her! Im worried she could be bipolar, hope she is seeing a psychologist and everything goes OK for her 💔
Morgan can I do a painting of you? You inspire me so much and you’re so beautiful. I messaged you on Instagram
I’m so sorry you had to go through that. I’ve been in a similar situation. It’s devastating to be picked out like that. You are an amazing woman so don’t sell yourself short. Always remember that it will pass on those days you can‘t see the sunshine even when there isn’t a cloud in the sky. Please know you matter. You are important to me and to many other people. You are a beautiful person inside and out. You are a strong person but not tough. Never compare yourself to others you are an individual. You can only be yourself. Thank you. May you please take care and stay safe.
This is me right now I am so overwhelmed I am crying my self to sleep because I can’t anymore
WOW I LOVE HOW I THOUGHT OF U YESTERDAY and was like hope Morgan’s ok, but also I’m not ok school is hectic AF maybe she’s just focusing on that grind rn. But kind of. You were going through similar shit like me 😂😂😂😂
I am going through the exact thing right now, This video made me feel a lot better knowing that I'm nit alone <3.
🌻💕
why is this in my recommended?
I love you Morgan you’re so sweet and kind ♥️
Stay strong Morgan. We need you
I feel like Morgan and I could so be bestfriends. I relate to her more than anyone I know
Am I watching my life? I hope everything goes well for you ☺ 🤗
I feel like I go through this and I hate it but just know we’re still here our lives aren’t Over yet it’s not the same tho but even if it was I was still messed up and sad and just wanted to cry and give up and I still do but not as much I just wanna disappear sometimes.
Thanks for letting us see this Morgan🤍 It is nice to know it’s not just me
I’m sorry you had such a bad week.  It is such a hard year.  I applaud myself when I make it a week with out crying.  Always remember you are a shining light for someone.  You always make me smile when I’m having a bad day. I appreciate you.
The part about friendship I feel so much... I’m 26 and my life looks so immensely different than before. I was so happy then. And so many of the falling outs I’ve had have ended dramatically, even if I wanted them to end peacefully. I find this year has made us have to look at all this pain within us, all this fear of the future. It’s not easy! I think you are so brave for sharing all of this. If you want a penpal friend from montreal im here ❤️🥲
Where is the cute white jacket from? :) 15:00
I used to tell myself everything was okay but I feel like that was making me break down more. I had to tell myself I’m not okay, but I’m not always going to feel like this. I love you Morgan and you have a ton of us supporting you and wishing you the best. We are all here for you. 😌
The amount of respect i just gained because you showed this side of you (and i respected you so much before hand). You showed the raw and the real. It is so important to share this side and raise awareness about/around it. Everyone has their struggles and battles they face, no influencer has a perfect life. Thank you Morgan. We love you, so much.
Ooof, so relatable, babygirl!!! Sending lots of love and good vibes!! It’s been a rough year, healing takes time🤍🤍🤍
Morgan, you’re so beautiful. Try not to be so hard on yourself. ❤️
The way I relate to yoooou🥺🥺🥺🥺 ugh I appreciate you so much for putting this part of you on YouTube. Thank you for being you.
Just made an appointment with a new therapist because my current one has retired, you’re not the only one struggling rn and we’re all in this together ❤️
"Stop thinking about everything so much, You're breaking your own heart" Overthinking is our worst enemy. Just don't Overthink.
This Is the most realistic video  ever .
Shout out to all you Back Row Bitches!
Medication!
Thank you for sharing this.
When I Is Replaced By We, Illness Even Becomes Wellness! Stay Strong! Your Videos Bring Happiness To Many People! We Support You In The Easy And Hard Times! Much Love! ❤️❤️
this was hard to watch bc i want to be morgans friend so bad to just remind her shes an amazing human every day...
You are a wonderful person Morgan 😢and I’m so proud of you.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I have felt the way you’re describing and honestly it’s the most conflicting/confusing way to feel. You know there is so much good surrounding you but that dark cloud just chases you everywhere. Sending you love, Morgan! You’re not alone in feeling this way xo
Hey Morgan, You're not alone on this feeling at all. I feel the same way lately. When you're with people it's easy to forget the pain, and it's another story when you're alone. Glad to know the feeling is mutual even though it is painful. I hope you will be okay soon. <3
We need merch that says “back row bitch”.
Move to ny with Emma
In the words of drag race royalty  Latrice royal would say the “5”G’s.   .......G-ood .....G-od... G-et ..A... G-rip.. G-irl......... it will all be okay ....my grandma bless her soul  would tell me the rain might come down but never forget the sunshine is  right behind
I love you 🥺 thank you for this. I had a ROUGH day. I hate work. I just got a promotion and I wish I didn’t. I am so drained and exhausted trying to keep my performance up. It really goes to show, be careful what you wish for. Now I feel ungrateful and shitty about myself 😢 I just want to sleep. I hope you’re week is going better Morgan. Just know, you’re not alone and as long as you continue to be a good person, you will end up being endlessly happy 💕
Let’s be besties cause girl the only place I go is my room, kitchen then my laptop 😂🥲
HOLY CRAP! THIS IS ME ASF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I Just graduated college and Jesus, nothing is the same anymore. No one talks about Post College Depression. It's a thing. The people that you have been around for 4 years, will move on and live their own lives. The friends you made in college will get into relationships and slowly detach from you. I saw how I slowly became less  important in my friends' life as I saw her boyfriend becoming more important to her. Which is fine btw because that's how life works. But it is soooo hard. I am 24 about to turn 25 this year and I have never been in a real relationship. I am alone most of the time and I crave human interaction. I spend most days comparing myself to my friend who seems to have it all and I therefore become more depressed. Lockdown is only making things harder too... Anyways I'm trying to figure it out but it is so hard :')
Some people can't live in a place like LA. She seemed so much happier at home. She should just go back. She's saying she lost friends she had 2 years ago which is clearly Andrew and Garrett. If I were her I'd be so mad with Shane for doing what he did.
I love you Morgan
I wish I lived near Morgan so we can vibe 😭 lemme come cheer u up 🥺
We are literally the exact same person. I love you. You got this
I feel like you need to get out of LA ASAP! You seemed so much more happier In Colorado. Hopefully things continue to get better Praying for peace for your mind, body, and soul! Continue to stay strong and never feel less than to ask for help!
Sis!!! Red is your color. 😍 I’m so glad you showed this side of yourself because we all go through it at times. This is such a genuine video. Keep your head up. Better days are ahead and you got this! ❤️
You are suffering and it is unnecessary.  I truly hope you don't give up on counseling/ maybe meds.  It took me so long to seek help.  I finally found someone who nailed my diagnosis and truly feel like the real me for once in my life.  Been almost 10 years of mostly smooth emotional sailing (pandemic messed me up a bit 🙄), but learning coping strategies has helped.  You know the truth, Morgan.  It passes.  But you don't have to suffer the rollercoaster.  Hope you are feeling better.  Keep moving.  And you look amazing!!!
Can I be your roommate Morgan 🥺❤️
I pretty much relate
Thank you for your honesty - you aren’t alone. Please find a great therapist if you don’t have one already. I talk back to you the entire time trying to help, but you can’t hear me. ;) Life can be overwhelming.
Can't thank you enough for this video today. 🥺
Did she turn down the Illuminati?
One day at time kiddo, that is all you can do. Glad you are taking care of your mental health as well as your physical health. You got this and I have faith in you ❤️❤️
I totally relate
❤️
This makes my heart hurt for anyone with depression. Thank you, Morgan for being so raw and honest. ALSO, I would never go back to that cycling class. How toxic!
Take these moments and journal them make list. Record feelings. Record gratitudes. List wants. List needs.  List goals. List anxieties. List hopes. Do stream of consciousness writing...
I can totally relate! I'm glad I'm not the only one who feels that way sometimes 😂
aren't bottom feeders the ones that work hard to keep the tank clean? those other fishes only swim around and poop all day.
Aw Morgan, I am so proud of you. It takes a lot of courage to be so honest. You grow through what you go through 💚
I’m going through the same thing it feels like everything is keeps crashing down on you and then you break  You’re right because I didn’t know it myself I thought I was the only one feeling like this but after talking to family and friends everyone feels that way some more than others I also feel like running away because it gets to much  Just do what I’m doing taking it one day at a time
i know im commenting alot, but while watching. and what your feeling is exactly what im feeling every single day and i get happy when i leavebut when i get home im alone and empty just like a empty shell. i hold on to everything and it hurts. glad you made this so i dont feel alone with these feelings but i would never wish this feeling on anyone and im so sorry you feel just like me.
Hang in there hun but I see you go thru what my daughter goes thru. Its not bad remember that everyone is different but same in some aspects. My daughter just can't be alone for a very long time which I see the same aspect as you. Plain and simple your a people person, so instead of being alone most of the time is finding that one roommate that is the greatest, trust me it takes time to find that soul roommate but it might be worth it.
Oh honey I know how you feel. Depression is awful. It sneaks up and overwhelms you. You seem like such a genuinely good, caring person. You have thousands of us that love you.
i SWEAR we are meant to be bffs we feel the EXACT same way. i cannot shake this feeling!!! love you long lost bestie morgz!!!💛
This was my mood all day today holy shit
that white jacket and red dress is amazing on you omg!
Sorry.... CAN'T relate 🤷🏻‍♀️.......... Jk YES I CAN TOTALLY RELATE 😭😭😭 It will get better...... We will heal one day ♥️ depression is real girl 🥺  I'm glad you can recognize your emotions and work through them.
Morgan! 🥺❤️❤️ It will be okay. I know 100000% how you feel, I feel stuck or that I'm just on a roller coaster that just never goes up. I wish I could hug you girl! 🙌🏽🙌🏽 Keep trying to go out and have fun but please be safe.
I feel the same about life.
Oh sweet morgan. Thank you for sharing. First of all any soulcycle instructor where the vibe is supposed to be supportive and focused on you that is instead screaming that you are a bottom feeder is not ok herself. Dont let that get to you bc that is some super aggressive health obsessed bullshit. Second, you are not alone and you know that or you wouldvnt have shared. Everything will be ok. So many people relate to you and feel the same and when it is the right time the right people will come into your life. ❤❤ i hope you are still seeing ryland and ppl that are supportive of u in the meantime.
You are a smart, beautiful, fun woman.  Everyone loves you so much.
i want EVERYTHING MORGAN DOESNT WANT. lemme have pleaseeeee/
You're not alone it be like that for some of us most of the time and it's okay to pull through it and move on 💕
Why is this video so relatable 😂😩
Dude come to Massachusetts. How you think and your sense of humor are so insanely close to my shit 😂
GIRL LOL PLEASE MOVE TO COLORADO  lol I wanna see you genuinely happy
You know Morgan, this video helped a lot I thought I was the only one sad and depressed because I just got over a bad breakup and having a really bad down spiral with my mental health before my breakup. Thank you for this video bc it showed me it’s okay to show when your not feeling your best. I’ve been hiding my emotions and been super suicidal since he dumped me. You helped me realize it’s OK TO FEEL THIS WAY! ❤️   Update: found out he was cheating on me the whole time we were dating. The day he broke up with me he posted the girl he was cheating on me with on his socials saying that they have been dating for 5 months. That’s how long we were dating for.
“We simply have no other option than to figure it out, so here I am figuring it out” I don’t know why but I just really liked that statement
You got this! I understand what you're going through. Change is hard, keeping your mental health in check is hard. You will get through it, we all love you!
IM LEGIT MORGAN AT THIS POINT, I GO THREW all this and some
Honestly this is my everyday
I'm so so proud of you, Morgan! I'm much older than you, I also live with major depression and general anxiety.  You are doing great! ❤ It took me 43 years 😆 but with help I realized that how I talked to myself, about myself, really, really made a difference. I needed help to figure out why I was so hard on myself. You aren't stupid, stop telling yourself to suck it up and get it together and and and. It takes practice and guidance. You have a path and you will find the root of what's causing you this burden. And you will learn to heal from whatever that is. ❤ Wishing you serenity Morgan, cheering you on girl! 🤗
We love you Morgan! Pls move back to CO ur much happier there
Sometimes there is no reason for the way you’re feeling, you just gotta let the feels feel. You will get through it, you just need some time to heal and get through it ❤️ we’re all standing behind you every step of the way!
Love this video 💕💕thank you for posting this!!
Seems like a good time to send out the reminder that the words you say can have a heavy impact on others, even when you think otherwise! Be careful what you say because that small snide comment you will forget about in an hour can ruin someone's whole entire day. It's costs nothing to be polite!
I had a breakdown today. We all been there girl.  You are my favorite just keep doing you we love it
MORGAN MY HEART BREAKS FOR YOU RIGHT NOW PLEASE KNOW HOW MUCH WE ALL LOVE YOU, HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU. YOUR VIDEOS MAKE ME THE HAPPIEST ON YOUTUBE, MAKE ME LAUGH THE MOST AND YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL OUTSIDE AND INSIDE, I LOVE YOU AND I WILL PRAY FOR YOUR BETTER DAYS! XOXO
Your not stupid depression is real i have it too! 😔Your so blessed an beautiful an have a wonderful family!❤ Stay blessed beautiful! Tomorrow is a new day a new start! 🙏💯👑❤😘
Listen young one. If you have left people behind...it means you have grown and decided they did not grow with you. They can’t all come with you on your journey... it is YOUR journey. And now you have to find the people who fit this new person you have become...stay on this journey and keep growing...
Morgan, thank you so much for posting this. I needed to hear a lot of what you said in this vlog. The way you feel and how you’re expressing is it is exactly how I feel so much of the time. You are not alone 💕
Depression is such a struggle! It's a total chemical imbalance in the brain. I treat mine with medication but I know you told him not to do that.
Morgan, I think probably the thing the universe is trying to tell you is that you should live in Colorado. You always seem down in LA, its obviously come to a breaking point. Like you said you were thriving in Colorado. Go back dude ily
Relatable 💔☝🏻💔
I'm still staring at all the  clothes  in my closet that doesn't fit me....You did good girl!
YOU CRYING SAYING EVERYTHING IS OKAY IS ME EVERYDAY MORGAN
Can I please have all your sunglasses 🙏🏻😩
“Jeans that I’ve been waiting to fit that will never fit” that hit home for me😭 I guess I should also get rid of my jeans that will never fit
When she said that she felt like she had rocks in her stomach and that her throat was closing up and she feared the sun going down i felt that so deeply. That's exactly how i feel when i'm going through my worst moments, but thankfully it is always temporary. Morgan you're amazing never forget it :)
I just want to hug you right now. I've been through similar situations and it is hard, but you will get through this.
morgan, i completely understand. im feeling all this so just know you're never alone. things will get better :)
Honestly...I am so happy you shared this. Don't tell yourself that you shouldn't feel the way you feel because "you basically have a good life and are luckier than most".   Your feelings are valid and don't ever think they aren't. You are my favorite person on YouTube.  You are funny as hell, more beautiful than you will ever realize and it is ok to feel any way you feel. Forgive yourself.  You are doing just fine!!!!!
That b at soul cycle! According to Megan the Stallion, a bottom feeder is something else, which you are not. 💗💖💜
Are the unwanted/unneeded clothes going to be for sale on poshmark or something?
Maybe it's a chemical imbalance...but at this time, most of the world is sick and just trying to survive. The energy is not healthy and I believe that it's very easy to get depressed with the way the world is right now on top of every day difficulties with mental health.  Find things that bring you joy because that is all that matters right now!  If that means being around your family and friends as much as you can, do it!  Why not! Much love to you sweetie ❤️
You’re worth it and you’re beautiful, friend ♥️♥️♥️
People who get culty about their workout habits like your spin class instructor are just avoiding some other form of obsession or compulsion. In other words I think they may have a mental illness they are avoiding. Just a theory an opinion...
Thank you for sharing, Morgan! I have been feeling the exact same way, granted I am a bit older than you. I feel as though I've done everything I wanted and reached the highest peak. I'm at the top of my mountain and all I can think is I either need to sustain myself, find a higher mountain to climb or fall off. Constantly feeling empty as I have no idea what to do now. I think of moving and starting over. Life is tough but I believe that we will find our way and pull through!
Oh Morgan I feel your pain, I really do! You are not a bottom feeder at alllllll...... I love your videos, it hurts me to see you cry!  Now I am the bottom feeder! OMG!
Morgan, you are so perfect and I hate to see you sad!  You have a community of folks here that love you and want to see you thrive. 💕
Every time she said bottom feeder 🤣🤣
Hang in there girl!
so much loveee 💕
Honey, maybe it's time for also look for a place to move. If you're feeling a lot. You already started getting rid of things you don't need. But, please. Promise you will go to therapy. Love you, Morgan.
I feel the same way and cried when you talked about it
this entire video is a mood
Damn girl you are a true qweeen! Thank you for keeping it so damn real.
It must be said that Morgan is beautiful inside and out, honest my fav and the way she can be so real. We love u Morgan ☺️☺️
Love you and wish you had a depop to shop the clothes you are getting rid of!
Can I call you? LOL I think we could be good friends and I can completely relate to you on a personal level. I know that’s weird to message but 😅 we could all use more friends
I’d love to buy clothes from you!
Girl it's soo hard to find good friends
Im 26 almost and life in my 20s is simply empty for me it is the only way I can describe it just Lonely and Empty.
Your so beautiful!!! 💯👑😍 i dont have alot of friends near me if you ever need a friend or need to chat you can messages me! 😊 I pray you feel better ❤💯🙏..i am feeling the same way💯 Keep your head up your so beautiful an smart an funny an i will definitely be your friend! 🙏💯👑💞🥰😘
I'm crying 😢 because I can relate so much because as much as being a fun personality like Morgan and doing fun stuff when depression hits bitch you just cry and be  sad for no reason. You just over think for everything and you do things that will make more sad and insecure but yet you do it . Keep your head up . I was depressed this passed month😩❤
Sending You so much wicked love! :hug:
Okay but i am open to take donations! i am in love with all those glasses she said no to 😭   MORGAN we love you ! Ty for choosing not to be in that dark place every morning and keep pushing through everyday!
💗💗💗💗💗
I love you I love you I love you ❤️ Morgan I really understand how you feel and I don’t know where to start
You saying it's okay but not looking okay is my fucking life. That whole time you were talking while eating breakfast I was like ya same 🤣
I hate to see you cry.  Anyone that tells you that you are a bottom feeder is a mouth breather ;)  Gurl ... your hair is looking good!  So shiny and long.  Luv ya!!
I feel empty too sometimes 😔 so I know that feelings Morgan. We got this girl!!!
Ok but despite dealing with her demons, Morgan is an absolute goddess inside and out. So very proud of all your accomplishments and growth. May your journey allow you to find even more and further love for yourself, cause lord knows you deserve all the love imaginable and more. 💙💙
Mamacita!!! You are beautiful inside out. I love that you aren’t like other influencers. Just be you!! 💖💖💖
Think you looked good in all the sunglasses, like dead ass you have such a gorgeous face
i needed this today.
Morgan, you are so beautiful, inside and out. I appreciate you sharing this side of yourself. Helps me so much to know I’m not alone.
Your so miserable in LA , your always so much happier when you go back to your parents town. Move back to your home town, perhaps tell yourself you’ll see how you feel after 6-12 months there. LA seems to destroy you, I hope you’ll find some happiness 💓
I wish you nothing but good health and happiness, Morgan!
If this ain’t my life in a nutshell 😂
almost worse than having reasons to be depressed is not having "reasons" to be depressed, but being depressed anyways. I've felt this way so many times :( i hope the people in your life are able to see past the jokes and laughs because saying that you are scared for the sun to set is serious, i hope you feel better soon. <3
same, girl, same.
I need too do my homework too
I’ve been feeling similar the last week, just exhausted and feeling out of it
Morgan...you are so beautiful and still so young.  You can be and do everything you want with your life.  Im proud of you for taking the time to reflect and improve things for yourself.  Put yourself first darling...figure out what makes you happy and the rest will fall in place.
morgan you are so beautiful inside and out - wish we could be bffs so i could just be your hype girl! everyone in their 20s goes through this weirdness. You are never alone bb <3 rooting for you
Am 5 months pregnant and this video made me cry 50 million times. I know how you exactly feel morgan your not alone
I love you Morgan<3. This video touched me, I think it's normal to miss the past and it's easy to get caught in reminiscing old times, old friends, and old feelings of joy. As we grow in our 20's our world is constantly changing and if you have mental illness in the mix (me too lol) it makes it feel like such a challenge to adapt and keep progressing. Adding a panoramic ontop of this can be debilitating and makes one question what the fuck am I doing/where am I going?! You're doing great as far as I'm concerned and I want you to feel this way too! all of your fans are here to support you and each other. All my love to you!
i am 23 and going through the exact same emotions. im aware of all my blessings but also feel like something is missing.... i love u and youre not alone !!!
i feel ya so much, I find the best way to get the universe to give you a message is to ask it violently, respectively, or just very actively
This is so real and so relatable
This feeling is very familiar for a lot of people during these times. We feel your pain, by the way RED is your color so beautiful
Hey Morgan. This week was also unusually horrible for me due to someone making me feel like a horrible person online. It took a week for me to realize: I'm only upset bc other people don't think I'm nice enough. When in reality, I don't have to be anything to anyone 🙂✨
I was really hesitant to get on an antidepressant because I felt like it would make me a different person.  But I found out it just gave me the tools to better deal with my emotions.  I feel like I can better take on the day and acknowledge the good things in my life and not just  the bad.
We love you Morgan ❤️
*i can relate*
Love you Morgan! We need you
You look gorgeous in the red dress💗💗💗
As a 22 year old, I have never felt more connected to a video.. so many people are feeling this way Morgan and thank you for sharing with the world! You are beautiful and growing even if it’s the smallest amount of growth it’s still growth!! ❤️❤️❤️
You know what Morgan as a 23 mom of 3 little boys I have never related to someone more than I do with you because I have to same feelings and honestly I wish the best for you because you seem like a sweet lady who needs a hug and a roommate.
I’m jealous of how in tune with you emotions that you are. I just feel numb
I feel this video sooooo hard. Thank you for being so open with your mental health. This makes me feel like I am not alone, even on the days when I constantly feel like I am even while surrounded by so many people.  You are awesome, Morgan ❤
Yes ma’am miss ketchup and egg eater😃❤️ like sameee bish saneee 👏🏻 literal queen 👑
One of my psychiatrists once told me, “mental illness doesn’t discriminate. It doesn’t care what your gender, sex, race, age, social status, etc. is... it doesn’t care about all the things that are going ‘right’ or how successful you are, if it wants to show up & rain on your parade, it will.” When I first started struggling my buggiest hurdle was never feeling “sick enough” to warrant professional help. I think every single person could benefit from some therapy if it’s accessible & I truly hope you don’t beat yourself up for feeling how you do🥺💖
Queen! I feel you girl get it moving !!
Man this really hits the feels. I'm in avery similar situation and it feels weird to see someone that you don't know but still like and care about have the same stupid thoughts :( Like I too have had depression and stuff a long time and I too have been in a rough patch recently. It's weird tho too cus even though I know we are the same age I somehow feel like you are miles ahead of me. You see the signs this is coming and you try to get ahead of it like you said... now in this instance it didn't work out.. but still you have tried. And you got through it in a very productive, and imo a very healthy way as shown. Good on you!  I really relate to the school stuff except I also really don't. You seem to really like studying and the classes you take. I just feel really confused and pressured into studying something so I chose something I didn't know anything about and I'm realizing it's not something I want.   This comment I sort of a incoherent mess but tldr: I really admire you Morgan, and I can relate. 💜
💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Sim YOU tane iously
Thank you for being so raw and honest especially on a public level. It's important to be aware of your mental health and working through it.  Keep doing you, you're doing great. I know you will look back and realize all your growth and it'll be worth the fight. Love you!
the whole video was great until she said people aren't toxic lol honey don't let shane trick you he's hella toxic
She’s in school? Like college?
I’ll be 27 this year. I’m divorced, on my 2nd career change, and a single mom crammed in a tiny 1 bedroom apartment. Change is inevitable....
I love you❤️❤️❤️🥺🥺🥺 i love ur silly side and ur honesty with ur emotions. You’re a real one🥰
Red is YOUR COLOR!! Omg you need to wear red more. ❤️ 📍🎈🧨☎️🚨🎸🍷🌶🌹🎒  You’ve got this. Thank you for being so vulnerable. There’s a lot of strength and bravery in vulnerability.
Okay but can we talk about how good Morgan looks in that red dress 😍😍😍 you’re doing great Morgan!!!! Proud of you
back row bitch club
This is so relatable. 🥺
You are trying your best and that's all you can do is never give up.  Just don't dwell on things to long.
You gotta go to Dalia @century city! 😊 she’s super sweet and definitely not like that!
Morgan. Whenever you’re on LA you tend to fall into your thoughts. Keep looking up! You’re in an awesome city. Volunteer at an animal shelter, go to Malibu, grand central market pupusas .
I love you Morgan 💗💗 you are such a beautiful soul and a new chapter of your life is going to begin🦋💗💗💗
I appreciate your bravery in opening up and being honest about not feeling ok.  Youre not alone. ❤
remember that you dont have to be a skinny, blonde, LA, vsco instagram model at a soulcycle class to be happy and worthy of love
That red dress is EVERYTHING! You’re so gorgeous! You look great in everything though honestly
I’m also having a really bad day and something about crying with someone without being with them is strangely comforting. I can just cry and just not acknowledge it. Thanks for being so honest about your feelings
Don’t ever give up Morgan! We don’t expect anything from you. We just love you for YOU!!!
I’m so sorry you feel this way. If you are happy in Colorado with your family take 6 months there and then evaluate how you feel. Maybe it would be good for you.
I just turned 46. I have lived with anxiety and depression my whole life. The clothing purge is something that helps me. In fact, as you accumulate more shit, purging other stuff is also cathartic. You are brave to share this. Because mental health needs to be normalized. ❤️
Thank you for posting this! Takes a lot of courage! It’s so normal to go off course. This happens to me about ever 3-4 months lol
Yes, we're all trying to figure it out and somedays hit harder than others. I hate hitting the bumps in the road. I'm 23 and still trying to find my purpose here. I keep comparing myself to people too! omg. I probably need to stay off Facebook more.
Me with zero friends 🙃   I need a Megan in my life 😔
I’m honestly so glad to hear someone else struggling with the same things... it feels so shitty to go through your day feeling like this and thinking that you’re the only one.
I really think you should move home to Colorado. Once you got back to LA you got down again. Feel better 💕💕💕
Try Alba. She’s amazing. Manhattan beach and Santa Monica location .
You are in the same spot that I am in my life. I just finished my clothing dump and have so much more to do. I'm so proud of you. Just keep it up, in the end you will feel better about yourself. I hate the position you were put in. I wish people could separate that.
You’re amazing Morgan! So strong to share yourself and feelings with us!
Awh Morgan ! You crying made me cry 😭💜😭💜😭💜
<333!!! Love you Morgan!!
Please sell your clothes on Depop! Morgan I’ll buy them all.
This is what I love about you Morgan we all have these days and the fact that you can share yours with us makes it easier to get through💚
I have NEVER watched one of her videos without thinking oh my god Morgan is so beautiful wtf
❤️❤️
ily
I’m sorry that you’re going through it, Morgan. It broke my heart to hear you holding back tears. *hugs*
Morgan I feel the EXACT same way!!! I’m 24. I lived by myself until recently and I had moved away from all of my friends for school. I had the same friends my whole life. They were my life line. Now I’ve been moved away for 6 years and I’m still hanging on to those friendships even though we haven’t spoken in years! I feel so lonely constantly and have no clue how to find people who are worth my time and fun to hangout with. I have a meltdown Atleast once a month. I also don’t know what I’m doing with my career aspect of my life so there’s that. Anyways, my point of this comment is to thank you for being so open and relatable
I love you
How much weight have you lost tho. You look so skinny.
I needed this. So bad.
“Nothing ever goes away until it has taught us what we need to know... nothing really attacks us except our own confusion. Perhaps there’s no solid obstacle except our own need to protect ourselves from being touched. Maybe the only enemy is that we don’t like the way reality is now and therefore wish it would go away fast. But what we find as practitioners is that nothing ever goes away until it has taught us what we need to know.  If we run a hundred miles an hour to the other end of the continent in order to get away from the obstacle, we find the very same problem waiting for us when we arrive. It just keeps returning with new names, forms, manifestations until we learn whatever it has to teach us about where we are separating ourselves from reality, how we are pulling back instead of opening up, closing down instead of allowing ourselves to experience fully whatever we encounter, without hesitating or retreating into ourselves” - Pema Chödrön. I love you so much Morgan, I always see you as the best version of yourself. I hope you find the peace and understanding you’re searching for. I wish that you find the purest joy in life and have your needs always fulfilled like you deserve💖
This is such a hard thing to talk about but I’m PROUD of you. I know I’m a stranger but I went through this and telling my family how I didn’t care about anything and even with trying to avoid it. Also I would die to be your friend, you have a pure soul and that’s something to value
I have that not average hoodie...
YOURE A RICH GIRL FLOUDERING THROUGH LIFE NOT KNOWING WHAT YOUR PURPOSE IS. like cmon now. How many years have u gone through this. You cant blame the place, the people around you when the problem here is YOU. Stop running away from your issues and its not cute yo have a mental breakdown. For fucks sakes go to therapy and sort your shit out. You and me are the same age and it was relatable a few years ago but your a grown person now so act like it. You need some self confidence it does wonders. Sick and tired of hearing white rich youtuber complain about shit when they have the means to get help. I have no sympathy for u anymore. U need to sort your shit out 🙄
Im also going through it. Im sad and dont know why things happen the way they do. We got to be strong and over come this. 1 day at a time ok beautiful you have people who are here for you. Thank you for youre content cause i know im not alone hugs❤
I've felt the same emptiness and existential dread before, Morgan.  The only thing that will fill that emptiness is Jesus Christ. Mark 1:15 says that the kingdom of God is at hand and to repent and believe in the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  I am praying for you and I urge you to seriously look into Christianity. Some channels that may help you with some questions are Mike Winger, whaddo you meme, and Ruslan KD. <3
Morgan. Something that has helped me with health anxiety (feeling like I am about to die) is to write down each time it happens. When it happens again. I go back and remind myself that I in fact did not die.  I speak to my anxiety and say hello. I know you’re there. I’m gonna let you be here but you gotta go at some point. Breathe through it and note when I am feeling lighter.
Can totally relate. That feeling of emptiness will just hit you hard in the gut even when you're having the time of your life. For me, it especially happens when I'm the happiest and it's just something unexplainable. Like you're on the top of the world on the outside but you're like slowly sinking in a black hole inside. And it sucks every time. Just know, Morgan, that you are not alone in this battle and that doing vlogs like this helps you and us who are also suffering the same thing. Knowing that we aren't alone in this is enough.
Morgan...Honey. You are so beautiful and wonderful and hilarious and are so smart. You are such a good person everything is going to be OK!  Life is hard and confusing but you are 23 and are doing so well babe, you have got an amazing life and family and friends and job and are going to school.. I can imagine how in your head you would get being so well known and the worry that comes with that. I think that you are needing a significant other and I know that is really hard to trust someone with how well known you are and that has to be really frustrating and scary.  The right one will come into your life when you least expect it. Try not yo sabotage yourself by being afraid to let yourself get close to someone. Be cautious but when the right one comes you will know and go for it. Try not to worry so much and have some faith in people and live a little without worrying something bad is going to happen!   You are doing so well for a 23 yr old , look at it as you are kind of ahead in life for a 23yr old as far as financially and in being able to do really whatever you want so do those things while your young. This should be the time of your life. Trust me it goes do fast you will be 43 be for you know it the. 63 you know what I'm saying?   I'm 43 lol I just don't want you to regret not doing what you really want to because your afraid or to worried.   Idk im just trying to give you some words of encouragement and let you know how amazing your seem to be from an outsiders perspective.   Everything will be okay and if you are worried about be alone  at night get you a gay best friend and have him move in with you.  You will have a blast you will feel safe and it will help you on so many levels.. lol.   Take care babe.   Im drag queen and we are always right.   Muah
I still think you should move back to Colorado where (most of) your family is. You’re just a family person, and that’s okay! I don’t leave Tennessee because my family is all here. Even though Tennessee fucking SUCKS. 😅
Girl! Go move back home! Go where you’re happy! Don’t stay there if you aren’t happy! Take cookie and go! Maybe it’s be better to live on your own but right down the street from your parents?
Lol I’m currently eating and watching this but the fact the way both put our forks down at the same time is scary 😭😆
Why am I Morgan, Just 10 years older 😭
Thanks for sharing your life with us  even when you're having a bad week.. take care I enjoy your vids a lot, btw, are u gonna sell your stuff ?
You are not alone & this was incredibly validating right now. thank you for this, friend💛
Ik exactly how you feel like EXACTLY I’m in the same boat sister .
Hang in there, girlie. Thank you for the honesty in this video. Praying it gets better for you. 💙
I have never related to a vlog more (besides all of Colleen’s vlogs 🙃). Damn. I think we may all feel this in some form right now. We are re-adjusting once again, to so much change and getting back into the world is hard. It’s so exciting, with spring in the air and all the new growth around us, life is blooming, opportunities are around the corner, but we all have to leave our comfort zones and as Kylie Jenner would say “we are just realizing things”💁🏼‍♀️ love you Morgan! You are on a journey, you are settling into your womanhood, it’s an emotional time!
I love you, Morgan. You are one of my favourite people. Your beautiful soul shines bright, always. This vlog is so necessary to remind those of us who already know this world's darker side that it's going to get better and to show those who are struggling that they aren't alone. So many don't realise that the beauty and perfection they see everywhere isn't real and you manage to show both sides of the coin with grace and dignity. Thank you for being so full of courage. Sending you love and support through the good days and the bad💛
Girl try meditation music ❤️
I wish I could give you a giant hug. 🖤
Soulcycle and stuff like that is so f*cked! Like they have NO regard for people who may be depressed and doing their absolute best or have anxiety disorders. Honestly I’d write in a complaint. F that. Her language basically confirms the bad things your brain is saying about you and could seriously teeter someone over the edge that’s just dangerous! Morgan, maybe living alone just isn’t for you right now at this point in life and that’s ok! Do what you need to do ❤️also thank you for being open about your mental health. It makes others feel less alone. I’m not sure if you’re in therapy but it’s been really helpful for me and may help you too, I really recommend it ❤️hang in there girl. You’re such a light in this world🌻
Aww poor sweet girl. It will be ok it always works out. I wish you’d move back home 🏡. You seemed so much less stressed.
Im struggling too , I can relate . Its weird time out there, keep getting up each day. Stop Comparing and despairing lady. You are fabulous on all the levels.
💗💗 all love here. Also you look freaking STUNNING. Omg.
I think Morgan needs a roommate, someone stable and there for company.
<3
I own two pairs of those DC shoes and I love them 🤣😭
I love this! I relate so much!
Thank you for this. Such a good soul just trying to override this wave of sad. Normalize the emotional spectrum
You are gorgeous and beautiful and powerful and smart u don't need any one  And u should stop comparing your self to other people no one is really happy 100% of the time no one have a perfect life and that's okay that's normal that's life and the more you except that the better you will feel
Morgan you are so important ♥️ I love all your vids, and you are so amazing:) never forget how awesome you are
If you're happier in Colorado then why live anywhere else?
When I think of you, I think of sunshine. But I am so grateful that you decided to share a glimpse of some not so sunny moments. I hate seeing you hurt, but I can't help being appreciative when someone I admire is willing to show a bit of the real deep shit in their life. We are all just good souls struggling to navigate human emotions. I think sometimes we don't realize how relatable our personal struggles are until we put them out there. It made me feel less alone to watch this. And I hope that you feel less alone by posting it, too.   We love you Morgan 💕
❤️❤️
So FUCKING relatable Morgan you are not alone! Your doing a great job, here cheering you on!
Omg I love you to death hugs girl!!!!
I feel you Morgan. I think a lot of us are going through the same stuff. I’ve said a lot of the same things you said in this video. It’s like my life is good, I’m happy and grateful but also lonely and disconnected... and I also cried while eating McDonald’s in my car on Friday for like no reason.
Love you sooo freakin’ much Morgan. I’m literally feeling the mirror image to everything you’re saying, and I’m sending you the biggest hug. Thankyou for being so raw and open with us. Look after yourself and know that there’s so many people who love you.
Oh Morgan. I’m so sorry you’re going through this right now. I am too and have in the past. I’m sending love and good vibes your way to walk through this tough patch. Love you. ♥️♥️
I’ve never related more..💕
Thanks for talking about this Morgan been goin through it too 🙃❤ One day at a time I guess... congrats for having the motivation to declutter and try on stuff am not there yet. And as for ms "bottom feeder" gym instructor, she should be seriously reprimanded for that shit. Yikes!
Most relatable video I’ve seen on YouTube in a while.
You are not alone. I have been going through it, too. Ebb and flow. ❤
Well done for sharing this so many people are going through this and don’t have a outlet. Everything is going to be ok your going to be ok keep pushing forward xxxx
Thank you so much for your honesty and vulnerability in posting this. It makes me and others and feel so much less alone ❤️ you have such a beautiful and loving soul, we love you!!
I really needed this Morgan,thanks!  I do that to hold on so much to the happiest moments in the past I feel like I won’t be that happy as I was then in those moments/memories.
Girl theres some days where it's just a crap day and you are going to be down no matter what happens. Those days I'm like yea imma just stay in bed
LA has too many ppl crying fake as fuck tears. You don't need that type of BS around you. You need find somewhere new or old where you will thrive and be happy- and surround yourself with original fucking people who couldn't give a rats ass about fame and clout!
omg Morgan!! I cried when you cried!! We all love you, you are a GOOD person and you do put GOOD energy into the world don't ever forget that!!! I can so relate to this video right now feeling so uncertain with how life has turned out and how its going to be, but its totally normal I think most people are feeling like this. Thank you for sharing and being honest and for making us feel not alone xxx
Girl this is what I NEEDED to see. I was crying over my ex while cooking my chicken and roasted veggies. And when you said the mourning of your past self and trying to recreate something in your old space. UGH I FEEEEELLLL that! You are fabulous and wonderful and like the wild cats say “We’re all in this together.”
Hugs girl. Stay strong and know that you are loved.
LEAVE LA GO BACK HOME
it feels good to think you're not the only person that going through a lot of things
i love this w all my heart, it hit home  🖤 sending you love always ✨
Girl if you need a friend I’m here for you just let me know we can hang out with each other
Crying this whole video because I feel the same way
Here for this honest content girl your doing an amazing job getting back to the you that has been growing while in hibernation you got this @morganadams I am inspired by your story growing up is hard I can't agree more with that statement and I am about to start medication for my depression and low lows I just can't cope without something outside of myself helping abit, if you could make a video about your opinion on medication that would help me be less intimidated by growing this way to confront my issues and have to ask my partner to sit with our newborn while I get my shit together
Lockdowns are toxic.   Masks that hide human emotions are toxic.    This is hard time for far to many.
Hey Morgan... I can really relate to you. Everything is alright and good in my life, yet i feel broken and sad and empthy. I have been struggeling with myself for maybe more than a year know and finaly got myself to see a profesional, because even if everything is fine, it does so much good to you. Idk if you are seeing someone, but I think you are such a wonderfull person and you deserve the best, so pleas maybe consider it. I really want to see you embrace the best you, and see you enjoy your life without comparing it to your past, and I really hope i can do too. <3  btw sorry if my english isnt the best, its not my first lenguage.
I am sending prayers for you to find amazing wonderful and happy people to come into your life .. I’m 41 and feel like I give 1000 % of myself to everyone I meet and yet I constantly get run over. At the beginning of 2020 my best friend decided to ghost me 🤷🏼‍♀️ who knows why. Thankfully I have an amazing husband of 22 years and a wonderful son but all you ladies understand that there is a time when we need our bff that is out friendship soulmate .. I truly thought I had found that in this person that decided to ghost me after years upon years of friendship. I keep telling myself I am over it and it’s her loss but then a picture of one of our trips together pops up in my timehop and I feel heartbreak, anger, loss, sadness, and the feeling of never being good enough all over again.   So I pray Morgan that you find your people because I don’t want anyone to feel the loss I have at the age I am. It feels impossible to find someone who needs a friend ...
Soul cycle is the worst
Love you Morgan but get the hell out of that apartment.   I swear there’s a negative entity in there.   You are miserable in those walls.
Sorry your going though alot. I really think you should move back to Colorado! Being close to your mother is the best thing in the world and I would give anything to have my mother here today but unfortunately she passed away 1.5 years ago from ALS. Being with family is the best cure for depression!
I've had anxiety and depression and a panic disorder my entire life and when I get in horrible episodes, the best thing for me... is to move in or right beside my family and spend a lot of time with them. Idk if that helps but it's one of the only things that really helps me. I hope you feel better soon. I know it's so so hard
Red is your color !!!
your whole life changed and your circle changed, im sure you experienced a lot of loss. you’ll be okay just find closure and live your life to the fullest
So sad to see you battling Morgan! I know that feral feeling of having rocks in your stomach & always being on the verge of tears. There’s so much joy ahead I promise. I admire you so much for continuing to press on and do your best. I’m sure everything will all make sense and come together soon xx
Morgan, you might not see this but you are a beautiful woman! You are the most “real” person on YouTube. You are not the typical LA youtuber. It’s ok not to be ok and thank you for opening up...not a lot of people understand what anxiety feels like. You are stronger than you think.♥️ you
Do people really break down like this? Like in real life? Like I’m 22 and have idea what I’m going to do with my life but like... I’m not like feeling down about it
With peace and love, the shoes look like nurse shoes 😂
Love you Morgan❤️ you’re literally the most relatable girl on this platform 🥺 this really hit home for me. Hang in there💕
Thank you for being so honest & for using your platform for good. It’s nice to know someone else is experiencing something similar. You’re amazing
Babeeee your not alone
It’s a break through not a breakdown..merch idea?? 💕
Trying to eat without crying and trying to convince yourself your okay is literally the definition of going thru it. Literally throw back to the worst time of my life.
Aww move somewhere 💕🌸 we will always be here !
Thank you for showing a real look at what depression looks like and how it’s okay to not be okay. It’s okay to need help and recognizing when you need help is so important! Know that depression is an illness and need to be treated as such. Stay strong Morgan ❤️
La seems so toxic. I think you can still make amazing content in a better place close to family
Love you Morgan!! I relate to this so much Im glad someone else feels the way I do ( although its sucks so I wish you didnt have to experience it) thank you for posting this 💖
go hang out with Garret and Andrew :(
I’m so sorry to hear you’re going through this right now.. you are so strong love. I am currently off of work due to the same thing.. I would love to be friends❤️
💌.
Girl. LEAVE LA.
I gave up on trying to make friends. If it happens it happens but I only have 2 friends I trust and I'm happy just having that. At least I have my family. People are drama and I hate drama
As a fellow 23 year old that looks like she has her crap together (married, big girl job, and owns a house) my crap is far from together!
I never in my 23 years of life had any mental health struggles. Last November deppresion and anxiety hit me so hard, my body freaked I was at point of barely surviving. It is hard to understand that you can have an amazing life and still struggle. Be kind to yourself, you are valid, your feelings are valid!
oh , i just wanna hug you 🥺
100% relate and I honestly needed to see this to know I'm not alone in depression
Omg Aw wish I could give you a big hug ☀️💞
I love you for this morgan.
Hey girl! I’m 32 and still figuring it out, so at least things are consistent 🤪 It really sounds like living alone is not your jam. I lived alone for a year and it was okay at times, but the alone time can definitely encourage the darker, more depressing thoughts when you don’t have people to talk to in the moment. Wishing you happy times ahead!  Ps thanks for sharing about soulcycle - I will NEVER try that lol I’m way too shy and introverted for that nonsense.
LA is not a good place for you. And that’s okay. Move sis!!!! I recently lived in an area that made me depressed. I literally pray about it. Found a new place in another area, packed up and moved!!! So happy now
Morgan, this is so relatable. I'm going through all of these emotions myself and it is so tough. Thank you for sharing the reality of depression. It's ok to not be ok sometimes.  Hang in there and keep fighting girl. Proud of you.
Please know that you’re a beautiful person and you’re stronger than you may think. We love you and are here for you!
Morgan, I feel the exact same way. I used to lose friends pretty easily and this month, my best friend of two years stopped talking to me. He blocked me and gave no explanation. When my friends asked him, he blocked them too. I even drove to his house to see if he would explain the issue he had. He was inside watching iCarly and didn't come to the door. It sucks because we always had our birthday parties together because they are a day apart and we would do a lot of fun things together. I had a panic attack over the situation but I have had real friends that have been checking up on me and being amazing. I really hope you are able to get through this. We love you, here!
16:30 - that feeling right there - that is clinical depression in a nutshell. And that frustration is shared between every one of us who has it who follows the stupid advice of "just go out" "get over it" like its not something that you can just get over. its there and its such a fucking pain in the ass to deal with.  I forget to take my meds for one day and i will literally sleep for 12 hours the next day. Depression aint no joke.
I feel the exact same honey. We will get trough this. And if you really want to escape...hit me up and visit me in germany :D
I hate seeing you upset!! You're doing awesome, seriously. 💛 You have a beautiful place, a good career, you're going to school, you try & work on yourself, you look amazing. You just don't thrive when you don't have loved ones around you & thats totally normal. Try not to be so hard on yourself. I personally think you should move back to your home state where you can be with more family and have some old friends around. I think it'll help you..
8:56 , but it does work, u got this QUEEN, hey love you long time Morgan❤️
Why is Morgan so beautiful
It gets better, I promise
Hopefully this doesn’t come across weird, but probably will 😂🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ I am older (43) and remember feeling this way. My 20’s were hard, trying to find myself, navigate friendships ending (growing apart, etc) and trying to form new friendships, looking for my purpose, trying to date. I cannot imagine trying to navigate that during a freaking global pandemic. I found that during my 20’s I felt very alone and at times felt like I was waiting for my “real” life to start. It gets better. You seem real and genuine, pretty, smart and funny, I think you have a lot to live for and I hope you find what you need to feel whole. ❤️❤️
Sending you positive and healing vibes! ❤️ keep trying!
Girl I don't know what you doin to your hair, but it looks amazing❤️😍
I'm feeling for you, girl. I've definitely had periods in my life where I struggled like this too. I think you would feel much better if you moved home. Sometimes we just need our mama's. Also, you're a freaking bombshell.
Oh honey.  with anxiety and depression you will have those days. Those days that feel so dark you don’t even want to let a little light in. Those days pass. I’ve found that when you feel that down feeling it’s then and only then that any change can happen. That may just be acceptance. It’s ok to be mad at things . Things do suck from time to time. But when your down in that space just be kind to yourself and do what you can to keep safe during it. When I say safe I mean don’t use judgements or make decisions when you feel like this. Just wait. It’s ok everything can wait till your ready. I wish I lived close you could come cry over a plate of nachos with me.   Just know this too shall pass 💜
You are loved and the pain is temporary.  Don't give up.   As fucked up as you think you're life is right now, there are millions who would trade places with you in a heartbeat.  Wonderful things always seem to happen after you go through shit like this, so remember that.  You have a FUCK-TON of wonderful things headed your way.
I can relate so much to what you were saying towards the end of your vlog about doing everything right, but it's still painful/it's not getting better. Also about the sun setting....I have never related to anything more in my life. I just tell myself if I feel like I am doing the right thing and it still is hard. I know it will correct itself eventually because I am doing my part. Also if you can only give 1% effort then that's enough.
Morgan ♥ Life is worth living. I'm sending you a virtual hug to you and Cookie. LYSM ♥♥♥♥
Morgan CO is your happy place..there is so much you can do there asa youtuber..LA is too toxic for you
I mean this in no offence, its supposed to be be funny, Morgan cring while eatong eggs and saying it's fine is a MOOD.
I’ve been legally disabled since 23, due to auto immune diseases. I look perfectly “normal” no visible disabilities. I haven’t been able to work since 21. I started to get sick while all my friends went off to college, I’m now 36. An abusive marriage thrown in there.  And also finding out I can’t have children. Then I too decided to move to a different state to start a new life. But it’s worse. Among my diseases I struggle with anxiety and depression. And yes, I’ve laid in bed for 5 days and not taken a shower. I have good weeks and bad weeks. I don’t think I could’ve done all this without my dog. She’s company, when I have none. She loves me, I love her, sometimes I live just for her, but it gets me by. Totally get you Morgan. There are many like us. ❤️
Awwww Morgan I love you so much. I’m so sorry you feel this way. You are wayyyyy better than anyone in LA. Everyone’s fake af! You’re a real person and so relatable and I wish we could be friends ❤️ you’re amazing love
This is absolutely where I’m at in my point of life , I’m a 22 year old mom and I have always thought I something was wrong with me bc I have always felt the same way your going through and hearing you being so brave and putting it out makes me feel that there is hope and everything will be okay. Thank you Morgan for always being honest and truthful through your videos ❤️
I just wish I could give you a hug. I’m so sorry you’re MH is so bad. It sucks. Like I really know it sucks. I can do no more than send you love. Xxxx
You're amazing Morgan! And I can relate in some ways to how you are feeling, I am in school and work at the same time and I don't get a day off during the week, I love my life but still it does feel like something is missing, maybe it's covid fatigue I don't know, but just try to stay positive and focus on the good, grow through what you go through as they say! Things will get better, we all struggle sometimes , you are not alone then if you feel alone,hang in there girl, better things are coming your way!
morgan you are very inspiring!
When you said it's hard to make friends i felt that at my core. I am currently on a journey trying to learn how to keep to myself without depending on others to make me happy and watching your vlogs of how you're able to manage living alone really inspire me. Give yourself more credit cause i wish i was half as courageous as you for moving out and trying to pursue a different life. I also just quit my job of 3 years today and this week I'll start a new job that I'm not even sure it's the right move for me. I'm sending you the biggest hug ever and i hope you find a bit of more bliss in every day and in yourself ❤️
I can totally relate, these are very hard times. Especially when you go through painful seasons that you don't feel you deserve. I've been there a lot lately, I know I'm not perfect but, you'd think I was worldwide criminal for the brutal season of rejection and loneliness I've endured. But, I believe greater things await for all of us. We will get through this 💜
Thank you for showing the raw side of you.. thank you for being you♥️♥️♥️♥️
You always make me laugh Morgan! Thank you 💜
i have never related to something more holy cow
Was hospitalized for a mental health crisis. Super suicidal. I lost 40 pounds in a month and was puking from non stop panic attacks. Finally on meds it's only been a week but I'm hopeful. Don't give up. Hold onto whatever you have to in order to keep fighting. Sending love and positive vibes 🖤
I just want to give you a big long hug and help you feel better. You're an amazing and awesome person!
thank you for sharing this honestly helped a lot today.
Sending you love Morgan ❤️ I know it’s hard right now and all those memories that go through your head make you feel make it harder but It gets a little better. You’re a good person and you put out so much positivity to the world.
It sounds like right now in your life you need to move home. Everytime you go back to LA you seem to have a hard time coping. It’s ok to take a step back and figure it out. You don’t have to live with your parents. I am glad you kept the crying parts in. Thank you for this video.
Oooh girl I feel like we could be best friends. I feel the exact same way about giving myself to people. I try and be a good person and be there for others but then no one is there for me. Sending good vibes ❤️
Bring DC back
Morgan just know that you deserve to exist and be happy just as much as everyone else. You are more than just a sum of your accomplishments. There's a lot more to a person than how "productive" you are. It's not clear why you're feeling so down, but I think you had an insincere group of friends who made you feel like shit about yourself. We love you! There are better people out there!💕
Move to Colorado!!!!!
Morgan, go home! You seemed truly happy there, and if you feel as empty as you do being in LA, why make yourself miserable? I know Ryland and Shane are there, but that doesn't mean you'll never see them ☺ Truly wishing you the best 💕
Hi Morgan! I’m so sorry you’ve been feeling down. I also have been struggling with feeling depressed in the city I live in, struggling to make friends and dealing with change. I wish I had some great advice to give, but I hope it helps to know you’re not alone!
morgan is so pretty.
This made me cry a little.. I can relate so much to Morgan.
We’re gonna throw hands if you keep saying you don’t look good in them jeans. You have a caaaake ⌛️
They look like old school nurses shoes 😅
SENDING YOU HUGS!!!! DONT FEEL ALONE, EVERYONE FEELS THE WAY YOU DO. COVID REALLY SCREWED THINGS UP. DONT FEEL DOWN, IT MAKES ME SAD.
You’re suffering all the residual stuff and backlash of the last couple of years in your family without actually being involved or at fault.  Actually I’d argue that the whole thing was way harsh and over the top for everyone. Anyway there are a couple of people in your old friendship group that Might need a reconnection. None of this was about you and you need to not be wearing all the psychological stuff that is a result of it xxx
I love you Morgan! 💕 I really hope you move to Colorado, you seem to thrive the most there. Sending hugs and good vibes
@ 16:04....the way she says "I'm feeling good"....so relate.
I'm sorry baby. I feel like shit too and run from my feelings all the time. I feel u babez. Sometimes when there are things or feelings you are running away from you can't live comfortably because in the back of your head you know something is wrong and you can't pretend things are good
I'm seriously down to hang out after the vaccine is out there. I'm in orange county but I love me an LA shopping/brunch trip! We girls got your back!
Omg Morgan😢 I relate to you in everything 💗 you're not alone 😘
Everyone feeling the same as Morgan is unreal including me 😭❤️
Can relate to how you are feeling. Keep being you💖  you somehow still manage to make me laugh even when you are feeling low.
But definitely great to know someone else feels some of the same things we do.
Hi love, I know exactly how you feel right now - I felt this way my whole life before I started getting help for my depression and anxiety. You are such a beautiful soul and I know that you will get through this and prevail. You are doing amazing and if right now all you can do is allow yourself the space to heal, that is more than enough. You are allowed to just exist sometimes :) Love you!
Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing this realness with the world. I've been struggling inwardly myself, and feel like an island most of the time. We've got this. We're going to kick life's ass and feel on top of the world soon enough.
I love you so much morgan ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dont go back go forward
so listen i never comment but i’m literally 9 mins into this video and you repeatedly telling yourself it’s okay when it’s not is really hard to watch  you are just not happy living in LA and it’s like me or anyone in the comments cant tell you what to do or where to move but why are you holding onto LA so hard when your so unhappy :( ? i just hope you have the courage to go home and make yourself happy in CO not just for your family but for your mental health too. it’s okay to be selfish and put yourself first. you are not a bad person at all for choosing yourself. here for you 🥺💖
You should have put him outside by the dumpster with a sign that said, "Please revive him."
You looked absolutely beautiful in that dress 🥰 hope you’re feeling better queen ❤️
I can tell you put the best version of yourself out there for everyone. I think it's awesome you can pull yourself together to make a vlog even when you're not feeling your best. 💖
Same.. Lately i have been feeling so alone like everything is the same. I wake up go to work then realize when I get home I’m alone and no body is there so what do I even do. Thank you for making this video because now I understand that I’m not the only one feeling these kind of things. You are amazing❤️❤️❤️❤️
Going through everything she described but at 37 with 2 kids.  I’m sorry you are going through it and I want to thank you for putting yourself out there like this.
Omg my heart 💔 everything will be ok. And to anyone else feeling the same, you are loved and things will get better  All I want to do is give Morgan a huge hug. I’ve been there, things do get better 💖
I applaud you for being so open and taking care of your mental health.
I feel you so much. However I’m 40 and totally isolated. It’s scary. I wanna get out. But when I can get out I choose to stay in. I have agoraphobia. I love people. But I fear them. I want to work I want to have friends. But I fear going out the front door. It’s scary. You are not alone. Don’t let it consume you. Make yourself get out and always talk about it. Hugs from Arizona.
i think we all wish we could be the friend morgan needs right now
Awwh my heart aches when you were upset about not understanding why you felt sad despite doing all the right things...I've felt that far too many times and it feels good knowing there's others out there that feel that way at times. It's always passing though and that's just what we gotta remind ourselves at those moments. Glad you're doing better 💜
As a 20 year old Leo going through similar things right now, I find it crazy how much we have in common. You’re right. We do just have to figure it out.   Love u Morgan. I hope things get better for the both of us in the coming months. 💋
i love u!! but did u notice that u eat w ur teeth? 😂😂 U GOT THIS MORGS!!!
Morgan, I am very sorry to hear you are having a downtime. I went through that and it is not a pleasant feeling. You need to start talking to someone and get some help. Try painting and be more creative for a charity you are beautiful and very active. #WithMorgan :) much love
First of all your are gorgeous in this entire video.  Second thank you for sharing this. You talk about friends and I’m sure there are so many people that watched this that feel like you are a friend even if you haven’t met.  Third what you are feeling just means that there is more out there for you. Just keep it in the back of your head that you don’t feel content with the current moment because there is more for you to explore and find out about yourself 💚✌️
Im 3 minutes in and im sorry i gotta say you look STUNNING OMG YOU AEE SO PRETTY
thank you so much for being open and honest about this !!!!!!!
Thanks for being so open and honest. I know the exact empty feeling you're talking about, it's like insufferable loneliness even when there are people around you. I went through extreme depression and have come out the other side. In fact I'm extremely happy now and even the smallest things give me joy. Takes a lot of hard work but you can get through it and you'll be happy you didn't give up.
I feel like you need to surround yourself with your family or maybe roommates! Its a lot harder sometimes to be alone, and not everyone does well with it! Sending love.
Thank you Morgan for sharing this. You're so unique, beautiful, original, and entertaining. I hope things will only get better for you.
Hey Morgan I know you get a bazillion comments but I just wanted to let you know that this video helped me. I’m been going thru some of the things that you have and this made me feel less alone❤️
Thank you for sharing this side of you, Morgan.
Also, ily!!! You are the most beautiful person inside and out, AND HOW CAN YOU LOOK PERFECT CRYING ?! What!!!!!
That feeling of empty and rocks in stomach i think that what we regular people call depression just saying hope u feeling better morgan
Morgan from 12:43 is the sugar mama I want
What your saying is you need a roommate
I feel like this whenever I’m scrolling Instagram so now I’ve set 1 hour limits on it everyday. I try not to compare myself to others but in a world where social media has its claws deep in your skin, it’s hard to avoid. You are worth it 💙
This is why I love u .... because u  show the real u ... and ur relatable and show that life is not perfect... no matter how much u try to convince yourself... if that made sense... I love u so much soooo much 💕💕💕 I wanna be ur friend so bad anyways keep going day by day beeps💕💕
Anxiety and depression can make you feel that way. I suffer with it every day I know where you’re at. Just keep getting up every day and doing it as hard as it is I know Sending hugs and prayers. You’re doing the best you can and you are doing really good I enjoy when you post and I miss you when you don’t try and have a good day hugs
17 mins im sobbing
Morgan I just adore you !!!!! I think that  there is something beyond just the mental aspect to depression there’s a biological reason  it is really a physical disease.  Start by seeing a naturopath and having all your vitamin and mineral levels checked  I absolutely love your personality you make me laugh so hard and you really are beautiful
Can we all tell SoulCycle to get rid of that garbage instructor?! Like everything she said is not ok!!
Should not have watched this while trying to put on lashes.. B IM CRYING WITH YOU 💙
I know EXACTLY what you're going through. I've been there a million times in my life with that sinking, hopeless, heaviness in the chest feeling. But somehow (through a lot of work and support) I am so much happier now, and I believe that is proof that it is possible for you too. <3
❤💚💜💙💙💜💚❤🙄
You are not alone and you are doing a great job in a sucky situation. I moved to a new town by myself as well and it was hard enough when there wasn’t a pandemic. You are doing the best you can. Snuggle Cookie and continue to stay true to yourself!
I have those feeling to Morgan, I'm sorry you deal with that also.. 🥺♥️
Some people don't do well living alone and that's okay!
MORGAN!! Can I buy some of those no sunglasses from you!! Some were so cute
Morgan! You look gorgeous in red ♥️
I love you morggy keep your head up and go where the universe is pulling you.  Sending you so many positives and good vibes.
I love you Morgan! Come to Texas and let’s drink wine and go kayaking 🤗
Red is your color... wow. You look amazing in the red and white outfit.
It breaks my heart see you like this :c fr ! We are here for you, and we are all struggling, so just let it in, embrace it and wish you the best !!! Your vlogs keeps me going and makes me feel so related to you <3 luv you
i feel exactly like this
Can I have a hoodie 🥺
Those who feel the most, hurt the most ❤️
Can I have a hoodie 🥺
I feel you Morgan. I feel like I don’t really have friends anymore and I really harp on myself for the way I look and have a hard time doing things alone. I know that it will get better 🤍
Morgan, I LOVE YOU! you are extremely relatable. Just keep on fighting and finding new ways to improve yourself. I love you so much. Sweetest and kindest girl on the internet <3
☀️ you're great
Girl I feel you. I just graduated college all by myself and I just feel so lost now. I’m moving again so I’ve got no one. I feel alone and try to combat those feelings by live-streaming on twitch, it helps but only so much because after I shut off the livestream I’m alone again.
i wish i could be morgans bestie, we would do fun things that make us happy but whenever shes down i would be there with her talking about it and getting through it together 😌
Girl everyone struggles and do not ever be embarrassed by it. And it is okay to feel, and work through those feelings.  Depression is hard to deal with.
I’m pretty sure you’re my twin flame because literally everything you said, I’ve said before except wanting to go out with people lol, I’m an introverted slug
Any young woman can relate to this, and as an older woman, let me tell you that getting in touch with your emotions and acknowledging yourself the way you do will pay off in the future.  A funny, kind, smart, empathetic, strong woman is a great way to spend the rest of your life. You got it all!  And calling someone a bottom feeder is not empathetic, its pathetic.
Girl, this is gonna sound so brutal, but cry your eyes out and feel like shit. Disconnect from everything and sit with yourself for awhile. There’s honestly nothing more therapeutic than releasing backed up emotion you’ve been distracting yourself from feeling. Happiness is a ‘fleeting’ emotion and at the end of the day we’re only human ✊💞
I think its good if you take medication again i see myself in you. I stopped antidepressants as well and then it hit back  now im back on it and feel better
I know most people do not want to hear this. With a higher power in your life it fills your soul. You can talk your problems out, you have unconditional love and He is always there!! My higher power died on the cross to save us, Jesus Christ. Just start praying!! God Bless all of you!
I’m 50 & I’m relating to this. Going through a new stage in life & hating it.
Omg I literally was and am going through the same thing these past few weeks
I've been feeling the same way today Morgan. Hoping I feel better soon cause I am pregnany and know it is not good for my baby. But I'm just so sad and I slept most of my day away. Thank you for making me feel less alone❤️
What a coincidence. I just had a breakdown at 5am today. Great times.
“Honey DC is gone”  As I’m wearing my DC’s that look like converse...lmao *oh ok* 😞  *we love you Morgan!!!* 💛💛💛💛💛
I cried for you, because I remember what it feels like to feel so low. ❤️ I love you Morgan, you make a lot of people’s lives different everyday, you keep a lot imof us here on this planet. Whether you know it or not, you save people’s lives by creating a 20 minute video that makes people laugh and know they are not alone. I wish I lived across the country girl... I would be your bestfriend ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for this 🖤 I really made me not feel alone. And for what it’s worth, like all of your other viewers, I would love to be your friend 🥺✌🏼 My insta is emiliahj
I’m so sorry you are going through this right now but you are right, you are doing everything right by getting up, getting ready, doing work, getting out, etc... praying for you.
You're not alone ❤ sending love!
i can tell you’re such a genuine and loving person . i have really horrible anxiety and i feel the same way about special moments and times in my life , one day it all just hits you that those times and moments are never coming back and just sends you into shutdown . it’s hard and hurts so terribly bad , but the best thing you can do is keep moving in your life , make the changes you feel you need to make in order to achieve happiness . be more spontaneous , speak your mind , let people know what you’re thinking . it gets better , it truly does . i hope the best for you morgan❤️
So I’m 24, about to be 25 (I think we’re close to the same age) and I just wanna let you know you’re not alone. I feel the same way about I feel like any friends I have our relationships are drifting away and it’s so hard to make friends at this age because how do you make friends these days? Everyone I work with is older than me and I don’t live in an area where there are fun things to go do to make friends. So you aren’t alone sister. Also I don’t know what the other source of your hurt is but just know it’s ok if you don’t have life figured out yet. I have a full time job and everything they say you’re supposed to do after college and I wish I would still just be having fun instead of already being at my forever career💀
I love you, Morgan! You are an amazing person - thank you for showing in public how really life is 🖤
Regardless, you are looking absolutely stunning.
Being from the generation older than Morgan, I don’t understand why kids her age have such depression problems? Could it be because they weren’t forced to interact with other kids at a young age, they grew up playing video games and scrolling the internet while alone. Now they have anxiety while doing the most normal daily mundane things. A lot of people 25 and younger talk about their ‘depression’ like it’s trendy.
Okay but what kind of sorcery is this. I literally have been having the worst couple of days and started to declutter my room when this video popped up.
Awhh morgan you're not alone. I think LA isn't for you. Maybe social media is hurting you. Just go back and live in colorado with the people you love!
we love you and will always support you. you dont have to stay in LA if it doesnt make you happy. you look like youre more comfortable in CO with your parents. we will always be here to support you in anything you do.
I'm going through this so bad right now for the past like 3 days. I hurt for you and I so wish you didn't have to feel like this. But I think I'm glad I'm not alone. It'll get better. It has to. 🙏
Okay but so genuinely proud of how you’re handling this rough patch. You’ve been positive, constructively reflective, proactive and productive. So so impressive and definitely massive progress from where you seem to have been in the past. As someone who struggles to even get out of bed when I’m feeling low, you’re doing amazing. And yes you are a good person. Proud of you and you should be too. Lots of love xxx
Girl! I love you! You are so beautiful and smart. This was one of my favorite videos of yours ❤️ We’re all a little lost right now. You look DAMN good in that dress and that jacket!!! DAMN 🥰
I had revelation during this video. Don’t go out looking for friends, go out looking for new experiences (adventurous or whatever) and the right people will come to you. Relationships never work when you force them. I dunno.
Girl! Sell your stuff on poshmark
I always feel I shouldn't give an opinion on your living arrangements because it's your decision aka not my business aka kind of rude to say anything but at this point I'm just gonna say it: I really do feel you need to leave L.A. I feel that city is so bad for you. Also instructors really need to find a new way to motivate their classes while at the same time not putting anyone down.
We feel you and support you, Morgan!! We love you so much, be kind to yourself ❤️
Hi Morgan ! So sorry that you haven't been feeling well lately 💕 I hope that you find your happy place real soon - physically and mentally! Based on absolutely nothing, I have that feeling that going back to Uni full time could be a good move for you: new experience, new friends, be in an environment where you would learn, grow and for sure thrive ! Maybe it s because I m European and we are different culturally, but I feel that you are trying to grow a little too fast - maybe because you are comparing yourself to others. You are so young but are already living a sort of full ass adult life - could it be that you are rushing things? There's nothing wrong with taking a step back if now is not yet the time to live such a lifestyle 💕 All the best, Jessica
Morgan you literally deserve the world and more♥️♥️♥️ you’re absolutely GORGEOUS and GLOWING the universe is on your side, always remember that. ✨
Maybe you can move to Colorado and convince Ryan and Shane to go too!
Anxiety. It’s anxiety. You are adulting and it does get hard and lonely. Even when you are in a relationship it can feel lonely sometimes.
It's ok not to be ok we all have days like that 💜
Aw honey, you're not alone. I understand. Have you thought of seeking help for depression? Depression can make you feel empty and useless. Please try to find some help. Remember, you are NOT alone.
I absolutely love you Morgan! You provide light ☀️ in SO MANY PEOPLES LIVES. 💕
I love that your so open about your depression. I can totally relate.
I resonate with this so much I had like a really off week and it made me feel like my life is going off the rails
morgan dont feel pressured to post you can post whenever you want we love you so much and we will definitely wait for you your mental state is the most important thing
Well now I’m scared to try soul cycling😂😂 sounds super uncomfortable😳   Hope happy days are ahead for you Morgan,you deserve it✨
Love you.
to lighten the mood: ur cry face is almost as bad as Kim K.  serious note: i am glad you are feeling better
When you feel the exact same and cry six time during this video bc I feel like I'm drowning in my own thoughts 🙂
Omg! PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HANG OUT WITH SARAH BASKA! She is such a great girly! Y’all would be amazing for each other right now. Y’all both need good ppl around u right now
I’m currently going through a three year breakup all while living on my own in my new apartment for the first time I feel a lot of what your feeling in some ways, we gotta face our new chapter for sure.. this video really helped thank you Morgan for being vulnerable
What are the sunglasses at 13:02? I need them!!!
Just came here to say as an older than you viewer (my 20s were the hardest years and scariest years) and someday you will have a partner and maybe kids and the loneliness will go away! You are just in the hardest time in life because you can’t see the future but I wish I would have embraced the solitude at your age and I feel like most of us go through the exact same things you are feeling but life gets better! Keep looking toward the future (and from this side your future looks extremely bright) and I promise it gets better! ❤️❤️❤️
This video was quite relatable. I’m a sophomore in college and everyday I feel like idk what I’m doing with my life.
ok Morgan got cakeeee
You are a good person. I think a lot of your fans genuinely support you and would be your friend in am instant if we were given the opportunity <3
Crying through a breakfast pep talk is something I identify with more than I care to admit. 😭 Love you!
You should do shrooms. I’m not kidding.
Been there, done that. I've said it before and I'll say it again - see a psychiatrist, get some anti-depressants. There is no shame in doing that and if you don't like it, you can always (gradually) stop. Sometimes there is just a glitch in the brain that meditation and exercise etc. cannot fix. It's just like being a diabetic and needing insulin.
❤️
I can relate to this on so many levels its crazy - dont feel like you're the only one lol
you might feel sad, but just know you are a great sweet person, and there is no one that you are around thinks nothing but the best. and we all love you or would not watch you. thanks
This video validated my feelings of loneliness and made me feel like I'm not alone, thank you Morgan <3
Morgan is only like six months younger than me but seeing her go through it really made my Mama bear instincts kick into high gear. There are so many people who love you baby, don't ever forget that. And if people don't appreciate the gem you are, that's their problem, not yours. I know it can be hard to let go of caring about what others say or think, but always remember, you're a bad bitch. You can do this.
I hear ya huh. I'm going through it as well.   Sending everything I can  XOXO
I couldn’t relate to this whole video more. But if you haven’t heard it today, I am SO proud of you Morgan for trying your hardest to keep yourself going. Never think you are stupid or less then anyone else for feeling the way you do. Things will get better even when they don’t feel like they will. You are worthy, you are beautiful and you are ENOUGH. Thank you for this and I appreciate you. ❤️
I've seriously have heard only bad things about LA. just move out.
Ugh I hate seeing Morgan cry she just has a beautiful heart and I want to be her friend ❤️❤️
I wish I could give you a hug!! I believe in people having a quarter life crisis. I'm turning 30 this year and from age 24-27, were the hardest years of my life. Every day I felt inadequate, left behind from what all my friends were accomplishing, and felt extremely worthless and ashamed. I'm not sure what people have done to help find their passion for living, but I hope you find it!! Mine was realizing that I'm here for me and my life path is different than my friends and what my family expect of me. Letting go of that burden of people pleasing really helped me accept myself. I wish I could give you some big sis advice/hugs haha. 🖤🖤🖤
She’s needs Garret!
Hugs 🤗
" just because they zip, doesn't mean they fit" ......no truer words have been spoken lol......and I mean this as I know ur pain!!!
you need ASTRO in your life. their music is healing. if i ever questioned my existence, now it all makes sense. ASTRO.
Same girl 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
I think youre pretty fucking great, stay strong homie WE GOT THIS :)
Thank you thank you! This helped me because I’ve felt the same. I love you and your openness. ♥️
It's not about the clothes you wear, the way you live, the way you look, or even your personality. It's about the people you're around.   Change your environment, and you'll not only feel happier as a result, but you'll forge healthier friendships as well.
It okay to let go don’t be afraid of growth! I’ve had to learn the hard way too. You will be okay 💜
You put into words my exact feelings over the last few weeks. You give me hope, Its not a bad lifetime its a bad day. We all love you morgan <3
It’s honestly amazing how much I can relate to Morgan.. and it’s amazing also that she’s willing to share her feelings with us. She genuinely makes me happy after I watch her vlogs.. honestly I would give a kidney to hang out with her 😅
Morgan, i'm a 25 year old law student from the Netherlands that is very blessed, and also depressed. I am 'figuring it out' as well and im in a  better place right now, than I was a year ago. It comes and it goes like the weather. There's always these trigger moments (like your soul cycle class) and we have to be aware of them and how they can slowly push us into that irrational and dark well. This might sounds cringy, but what worked for me (besides the psychologist, and the anti-depressants, God) is slowly coming to this strong realisation that I deserve to love myself. That we are not born, we are not destined to be on this planet just to feel unloved and unhappy. It's futile. Be a giant, let the world be small. And don't expect others to treat you, like the way you would treat them. Unfortunately, that's just not the way this world works. But continue treating them, like the way you want to be treated. And I think, that as you're evolving (btw, that 'not a breakdown, but a break though' shows your wisdom) the universe will put the right people on your path. So, thank you. It's brave but very important to share depression. Those thoughts of low self esteem, having 'no future' and 'grieving' a past life you're describing are familiar to me. But please remember that it is the irrational depression talking. I don't want to be preachy, but if I can at least help someone with my comment it is worth my energy. Cherish every happy moment, hold on to your inner circle of people that love you unconditionally; try and love yourself unconditionally as well and never lose hope.
As you get older making friends is harder. It’s better to have a few true friends than 100 fake ones.
Hi Morgan ❤ girl I am the same. I know you don't know me, but like..if you ever come to Ohio could we get coffee and go on a hike? There's not much else to do here 😂..but I have a nice porch and am friendly af
I am aboom
I literally cried every time she did... we all go through it and she is the only one who has enough courage to tell it how it is
Hey girl 💛 just wanted to say thank you for continuing to make videos even when you're not feeling the best 😌. They really help me in feeling like what I'm feeling is not just me. I live in the UK and it's so easy for me to want that what seems to be "perfect" LA lifestyle with the gorgeous weather etc. It's not great here, all shops/restaurants shut and nothing to do. 🙈 Can't help but feeling like normal life is so far away.. I'm also waiting for life to give me a sign while I watch all my friends continue to live the "perfect" life 🙈 Your videos make me feel like I'm not the only one thinking this. Thank you. I know I'm just some random person but I too am always here. My insta is @charlotteey94 if you ever need anything ❤️
MORGAN. You will probably never see this but dear god I hope the universe for once works in my favor so that you do: holy fucking shit. We are going through the same season of life AT THE SAME TIME. I’m telling you...this was eerie. I’ve always felt connected to you but this hit different, sis. It’s as if you were speaking a nonverbal language that IM FLUENT IN. When I tell you...I could literally feel your pain in a different dimension. And not just from an empathetic perspective. I have (aka I AM) experienced your same (similar) emotions and have felt so alone and hopeless and empty. I won’t get into the depths of my own darkness but let’s just say I’m desperately searching for intention, purpose, and a reason to live.   As everyone has said, it’s so ....encouraging (??) to know that we’re not alone in “figuring out” this shit show we call life.   PS - plz move to nashville and let’s rule the world and make a podcast bc everyone needs a ginger and a blonde who cover their emotions and trauma with humor........
This came at the perfect time for me. Thank you for sharing this, Morgan. It's helped immensely.
Alright thats it. Im moving in. Ill bring my 2 kids and my chihuahua too.. we're gonna party like its 1999.
Morgan, I wish you’d go back to CO. It seems like every time you get back in LA fall back into a depressive state. Depression and anxiety are hard as hell but you found your happy place while doing the renovations in CO. I just hope you find your safe and happy place.
Keep the hunger that you have,  You have a purpose and a destiny in life.  The uncomfortableness is there for you to seek out what that purpose is.  Seek and you shall find!   GBU.
Ughh babe, I'm so sorry to see you're really going through it. This video was heartbreaking and I just wanted to hug the shit out of you. There was a time when I walked away from my phone and heard you breaking down and I just turned around and wanted to hug you and reach you, but I couldn't and genuinely made such a disappointed, sad face.  You're a beautiful human and I really wish I had the chance to know you personally so that I could be there for you.  You'll find out one day where you're supposed to be, but i definitely don't think that's the right place for you to be in. I can't wait to see the day where you are somewhere with people you love and doing things you love. You will flourish and we will all be waiting to see it. Hang in there, Morgan. 💗
You can always move to Orange County and let me be your surrogate mom. 🙂 I’m in a relaxed suburban area that is close enough to LA for drives back and forth on any given day.  Take care of YOU, first and foremost.
Morgan 💖Look into CPTSD (complex post-traumatic stress disorder) - it might resonate with you. I spent years on the brink of tears. I kind of knew why but I got so used to it that I would explain it away. "Oh I'm just hormonal", "Oh I'm just upset because of X person" when I was actually dealing with real PTSD symptoms that were interfering with me actually getting well. Much love to you.
Thanks so much for sharing Morgan. Definitely been in your shoes before and you crying while saying “everything is okay” was super relatable. Love you girlie 💙
My god she is actually the image of Taylor swift 😍😍 like if you agree 🥰
This comment section is full of wamen
I relate so much
Just wanted to say...Thank you ❤️ Also, (this is beyond cheesy & weird, sorry lol) I was already a “fan”. But this just makes me feel like we would be really good friends. Thanks for being real. I think you’re great. I’m so glad you’re feeling better. 🥰
Does someone know where her cute red dress is from? (15:40min)
I highly recommend taking a hiatus from social media. Maybe only upload to YouTube and stay off the comments? Comparing yourself to others is such a downward sprial that thankfully, I was able to get myself out of by staying off social media! In combination with daily yoga and meditation, I was finally able to heal from the damage that social media caused. Wishing you the best Morgan, and sending you all the positive vibes 🥰❤🧡💛💚💙💜
i feel bad that i dont understand the whole crying
8:27 the best background ever
Get those plants!!! Even if they die after a while, its proven that plants lift moods!!
God, how did you not scream back at that cycling woman at the class?  Because I absolutely want to scream at those people. "NOT EVERYONE IS COMFORTABLE IN THE ENVIRONMENT YOU ARE CREATING, YOU SHRIEKY BITCH!"
Dear Morgan, you are not oké! And that is oké! Your mental health is important. I wish you the best x from a 23 year old follower from Holland🌷
Omg I’m soo glad u posted this bc everything u said that u were feeling that’s how I felt this past year  2020 really hit us hard like for me my home life drastically changed for the worse and it keeps on getting bad everyday and so  it’s been really hard. My anxiety is at it’s all time high I cry at the most random times I could be feeling motivated and ready to clean my room and do things that I liked but the second I stand up from my bed I get this overwhelming feeling that shuts my brain off and start sobbing. I mean it’s gotten to the point were tears don’t even come out and I’m just there like a freaking star fish on my bed ...so seriously thank u for posting this bc it reminds me that I’m not the only one going through something and that it’s ok to feel bad sometimes 💕💕much love to u and Ryland as well
Ok this is the perfect time for Morgan to have a glow up on the inside
You look stunning morgan 😍☺️
Do you even realize how gorgeous you are...you ll be just fine baby girl
POWER BOTTOM...FEEDER!!!! 😂
Start meditating consistently and take a daily vitamin D supplement. Nutrient deficiencies are linked with depression. Maybe see your doc and have all your vitamin and mineral levels checked. And stop eating animals. It’s bad fucking karma. You’re eating the adrenaline that was coursing through the flesh of an animal that died a horrific death.
L.A. Morgan and Colorado Morgan are very different, we can even tell on screen! Buy a little fixer upper in CO and take us on that journey with you. You deserve happiness and L.A. isn’t for everyone.. you could always come visit!
I LOVE YOU QUEEN KEEP SLAYING. LOVEEEEEE
hey morgan if your reading this, remember that you are loved and that u are so important in this world. you are beautiful and dont forget that. xxx
Love you Morgan! You’re awesome! ☺️💜💜
Love you Morgan, truly want what’s best for you!!! We love when you shine and share and we still love and respect you when you need a break ❤️
Damn girl I have been feeling the same way. I have these moments during the day where all of the sudden I just feel like omg this is it I am going to have a panic attack and die.
Girl looking so freaking gorgeous in jeans 😍😍😍😍
You are such a beautiful person inside and out and you should never let anyone make you think differently. I can relate to you so much on so many things you've said, not just in this video but in others as well. Having so much kindness can hurt sometimes when it feels like the world isn't reciprocating, you've just got to keep finding ways to get through it and find that silver lining. And there will always be something that lifts you out of that darkness, even for a brief moment and that brief moment can be everything for people like us who feel emotions so much more intensely and suffer with depression and anxiety daily. I just wish you all the best and hope that things improve for you. I'm trying to push through my crap now too so your video helped me see that I'm not alone, but we can get through it :) Wishing you all the best, Morgan!
damn when you mentioned the dread that comes along with the sun setting... seriously i feel like i relate to you so much. 2021 has been rly rly bad ngl, i miss 2020 in comparison lol. i've been so depressed & miserable that i finally decided to return to my parent's house but now i'm scared to leave again bc i'm all alone in my apartment & when i breakdown i literally feel like i'm dying i just hope we can all feel better soon
Honey you are doing all you can to keep yourself healthy. Talking to a therapist helps you and helps give you the tools that work for you. Interview them so you find one that works for you!!! I know what that feels like I hope you figure it out!
Morgan your best videos are of you in Colorado with your family and friends! Glowing and happy even if you still depressed on the inside
Girl I wear DC
I have been in a funk, too. I go to work and come home and lay in bed.  I'm in therapy and take meds, but sometimes it be like that.
Rich beautiful blonde able bodied privileged white girl invents reasons to feel depressed to foster a sense of depth
Move out of California to a state where you can be free to roam and breathe fresh air.
You look amazing in red! Your so beautiful! 🥰💜
I would honestly love to be your friend, you are an amazing person, if LA is really making you so unhappy go back to Colorado and as someone said in the comments, get a fixer upper and just do a Reno video, would be so good! Do what makes you happy! Also I suffer anxiety and depression and am shy and that soul cycle class sounds terrifying and I would have cried hahaha  Also that emptiness, I know exactly how you feel. What you said about emptiness, I feel it too. It’s not stupid and you shouldn’t have to feel that you need to justify your feelings and it’s not stupid that you feel that way.
Girl, get out of LA.
Morgan and I are literally going through the same shit right now I want to be her friend, sending you hugs 🥺🧡
But also. Hugs and hope you're having a great day today. Hoppy Easter 🐣
*sees the title* Me: (huge sigh of relief) “oh my god, me too”.
You look BOMB in that red! ❤️
Send me all your thingssssss #hoarderalert #iloveitall
Come to San Antonio, TX!! I’ll be your friend! 🥺😊🤗 that sounded weird. But, truly!
Love your nails 💜 My daughter & I love watching your videos together. You are amazing.
The feelings you are working through will get better. I have been there more than not. This last year has been a nightmare that no one can wake up from, being and feeling alone seems to be the new normal. I will however say I think there is a silver lining .
I'm originally from Texas and lived in California for the last 12 years. As much as I love the weather, the beach, the beauty of it, I could NOT stay in Cali. I was always miserable, never being able to find happiness. I hope you can find somewhere that bring you true happiness, whether its back in CO or wherever. Good luck.  "Life is a series of up's and down's"
Sending you lots of love 🥰
Oh Morgan I’m sorry your in this little funk! But I promise it will get better and you should maybe really think about moving back to Colorado...where you surrounded by people that truly love you and you can visit Ryland and Shane whenever you want.  I’m also going threw a depression and it sucks but I keep thinking it will get better. LOVE YOU MORGAN AND YOUR TRULY AMAZING!!!! 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💕
That soul cycle class is so obviously not healthy if the teacher is that agressive with their language. Glad you aren't going back to that!!
I know the previous medication you took didn't work for you, but perhaps look into another kind. Maybe something more mild.
okay but pleaseeeee let me buy all those sunglasses from youuu
Morgan 🥺 we all have those days. Eventually it will somewhat get better. Take it day by day.
Another chapter in the book of Morgan being one of the only relatable youtubers out there. This is why we love her ❤️
You need to live closer to your parents. Close enough to visit often and have a support system, but far enough away to have independence. Plan adventures with your friends, but find a comfortable place to call home. LA isn’t it. Nobody watches your content to see LA. You could go anywhere.
FLOW. WE. GET. IT.
Can I just start off with saying, you are truly beautiful and I think we would be best friends. I get extremely excited when ever you post a new video and I always love them... on another note GURL... You look heckin skinny o.o QUEEENNNNN ignore the mean cycling lady. DO YOU GIRL! I need to eat healthier breakfasts. Eating the same breakfast isnt a bad thing as long as it is healthy and well portioned which it looks like you do. You're killing it <3 WE ARE HERE FOR YOU AND WE LOVE YOUUU! You are a bright light. Your goofy personality puts other people in a good mood.
GET A THERAPIST, MORGAN, PLEASE!!
That instructor needs to be fired. period.
We love you and it's very strong of you to open up to us and show us that this is life for so many people and that's OK.
Morgan... you look absolutely beautiful!!! And you’re makeup is perfect!!! Don’t be so hard on yourself as I 110% understand and am in your shoes as well..... keep your head up and hey I am all the way over in Lancaster Pa if you ever need a friend!!
I'm sorry your going through this. Keep your head up g you got this 💪🏽🥺
Thank you for being real with your feelings. Sending you big bear hugs kiddo.
I only laugh because it is like looking in a mirror.
We are all going through it girl, you got this!!!  🥰
Omfg DC CASTRO's I had this when they came out LMFAO
i hope you find the peace in yourself... me too ... :(
Morgan needs merch that says it's not a break down it's a break through.
Morgan you are STUNNINGGGG in that red dress!!!!! ... and in every other thing you wear 😍
I know every feeling you talk about in this video extremely well. I always tell myself "this will pass too". It's hard, but it will pass
Wow, you literally explained everything ive been feeling for the last year and it really makes me happy that someone else understands ❤ #RealContentQueen
Omg that instructor was doing way too much... next time walk the hell out girl!!! xoxoxo
Morgan I'm in the same damn boat. 22 years and also lonely and hopeless :')
Morgan I would literally love to be your friend, But I live in Canada 😭 maybe one day we’ll connect 💕 I feel you on a personal level! Never feel alone! Like I’m broke af but if you ever wanna visit Ontario 💁🏻‍♀️ hit me up 😂
This is a beautiful video♡
Morgan!!! Weight lifting with a female pt with a degree in sports science in a private space. I’m like you I don’t want to High five girls and smile.
seeing morgan sad just broke my heart🥺
Hearing loads of youtubers talk about LA it sounds like kind of a toxic place and u need to be kind of a socialite to live there lol that's the feeling i get from it anyway, you seem a lot happier when you're near family, maybe ur heart is in CO <3
Whewwww I needed this...... I’m not feeling well at the moment either xoxoxox
Oh Morgan I relate to you very much!! Everything is going to be okay, between 22 and 25 is tough I went through the ringer too!. I have to say it’s also been the best time of my life. You are awesome and these next few years will be great to you I know it!
I’m so proud of you for sharing this💗 we’ve all been there
At 5:00 exactly how I've been feeling lately. Sad, tired and not happy.
You look so beautiful in that red outfit 😭😭😭😭😭
You understand how the universe works. It's true, the more you resist, the more it's going to throw at you what you are resisting. This past year has been a wake up call for many people. You clearly have been going through your own journey and right now is one of the hardest parts: when the people who don't serve your highest purpose start to fall away from you. It's difficult at the moment but you will get to a point where you start to feel free and and more yourself and you enjoy the solitude and this chance to be able to focus on just yourself. If you're feeling empty and stuck, look inward and feel what brings your passion and joy and start working on that. Try and live in the now as much as possible. Do active and/or passive meditation. My mantra that I repeat when I'm walking my dog or colouring/painting or whatnot is: "I am a strong, confident, powerful, independent, beautiful, secure woman. I love myself. I have abundance in all positive things including money". Look into acupuncture, energy cleansing, essential oils, etc. Medicine and natural remedies absolutely both go together. I hope some of this helps if you end up reading it. You got this girl. I'm sending you love and strength. You're a light and you make so many of us smile..you deserve to smile also. Do what you love, live your passion, face your True North, and do all things out of the energy of love. Everything said in this post can be much easier said than done, but it CAN be done. And never use the word try as try implies failure. 🤗💖🙏
I hate seeing you in a funk Morgan, it honestly breaks my heart. You deserve sm love queen ❤
::: HUGS ::: You're fine, my daughter goes through everything you shared! Thank you for sharing your true feelings❣
knowing you are going through the same things as me makes me feel less alone, i’m with you girl, 💖
this whole video is how i feel everyday
you look incredible in that red dress !!!
Love you Morgan ❤️🥰❤️🥰 Positive vibes and prayers to you 😇🙏🏼
♡
We love you Morgan!❤️
Morgan yelling im happy with a mouthful of eggs is such a mood.   Ive been exactly in that moment depressed and telling myself  to eat the eggs because i have to eat something but everything sounds awful.    ❤️❤️❤️  Go where your heart is happy because this clearly isnt it.
Thank you, Morgan. You are not alone. You're growing and changing and experiencing life's tough lessons, whatever they may mean. It's beautiful and sucky and I'm proud of you.
I had a hard week too last week... Thank you for Morgan for reminding us, we're not alone
I 100% understand the feeling your describing. You have all the things around you that you need, but you still feel like something is missing. You give your best self, but still feel inadequate.  You feel great in the morning,  a new day etc, but all of a sudden you burst put in tears for no apparent reason! 💗  I get it. It's  exhausting! Love you so much morgan!!!
Morgan, you are adored and appreciated. Please connect with your family and loved ones. Do whatever you need to do to feel good. It’s been a hard year. We need people is what a lot of us have learned. You are not alone. I hope this sad time passes for you and for so many others. Keep searching for your happiness and then grab ahold of it and never let it go. We are here for you. Keep reaching out. Your honesty is solace to so many going through the same thing. We aren’t alone. We all can get through this. It sounds eye rollie, but maybe we can all be from the same tribe. In this together. ❤️
In Quebec French we say ''ca va mal a shop ''
Also please stop calling yourself stupid. No matter how hard it is always build yourself up not down.
Can I just say, Morgan looks so good in all of these fits!
Thank you for uploading this vid.  Lately everything has been really rough in my life, but now that you mention that the universe has a way to give you signals but it’s up to you to get them and stop hurting, everything clicks for me.  Thank you for being honest with us and for letting us know that we al deal with the same stuff and it’s possible for all of us to keep moving.
(This comment is coming from a place of love! Please take it as so) Your emptiness is coming from not having Jesus in your life. I was in your shoes. Jesus is the only thing that can restore you and fill the void that you're feeling. Give it a try-- start with one little goodnight prayer. That's what I did. Love you and wish you the best.
This vlog is waaaay toooo RELATABLE. 😩
this broke my heart fr 🥺 i wanna move to la just to be your friend and constantly boost u up bc you’re beautiful and worth it and eff anyone who doesn’t wanna see that. keep ya head up sexi ily ❤️
Just what I needed! I've been so stressed today just overwhelmed with school, summer plans, Xanax withdrawal... Just enough to make my mind feel super hyper jumping from one thing to the next but at the same time not doing anything and not getting anywhere. This video pulled me in and calmed me down a bit
Morgan. I admire you. This is me- every other week. And to see someone normalizing this... thank you
You should Leave LA if you need to be closer with your mom! I recommend it! Besides all my favorite youtubers are leaving California!
Everything is gonna be ok morgan! I send you virtual hug and ill be yr  friend.
You need to MOVE OUT OF LA. Your soul is yearning for you to leave dude you need a better environment. When plants aren’t doing well in their environment you move them to a location where they grow better. 😊🌱
Please tell me you are seeing a therapist & Dr.
I hope her and trinity are still friends ;(
I have never related to anything more ever in my life
Morgan I relate to all of this so much. Thank you for reminding me I’m not alone, and also probably reminding many others. I believe in us ❤️
TRANSFORMATIVE HEART ACHE👏🏼👏🏼
I wish I could be your friend and you have tons of fans who would love to be too...  I know we're just "fans" but we care about you girl! I really love your vlogs. I hope things get better and that you make some new great friends in the future. Keep on keeping on. And dont listen to dumb soul cycle bishes lol. reminds me of this time i went to a yoga class w/a couple friends no one told me it was a very crowded popular "advanced" class. I ended up hurting myself trying to keep up with all them pretzels and the "teacher" was a total unhelpful snot! i never went back. lmao
Have you seen a therapist sweetie? They can help a ton!
I was eating and crying with you
I enjoyed this vlog so much 💓can we be best friends yet
You know you can get free cardboard boxes from groceries stores, Costco or Target instead of buying them. Love u girl!! It’s ok not to be ok, remember that!
Sending love and hugs, Morgan! You are a beautiful person, remember that. :)
Might sound creepy....but I love your vibe!! I’m your friend. Let’s be friends!! 😁❤️ I’ve been watching your videos for years along with your brothers. You are an amazing woman. Keep your head up girl...keep doing you and ALWAYS do you, for you!!! Nobody else matters, but you. Take care of you first alway!!
GIRL, this is basically every time I talk to my therapist during the past few months 😅 it's been quite the year
God I can relate to this so hard. I was the same way when I was your age, literally everything is relatable. I am only three years older, but my life changed right after I turned 25. Don't lose your drive even if it is minimal. Keep going through this hole, you will never regret it unless you let it get the best of you. The fact that you went through your closet, an amazing step! 👏 AND you went out with friends? You're on fire!  Keep doing you Morgan, someday, life will turn around while you keep fighting for normalcy. XO
I literally posted a video having a breakdown yesterday so I feeeeel you so hard 😂
I mean... There are so many things I'd like to say after this. It's very easy to assume that people who are smiling a lot and laughing loudly are fine and happy and have no worries. That's so untrue. We really need to be very mindful and more sensitive now, especially with all of the lockdowns and loneliness people are experiencing. Morgan, you are so smart, good, amazing, funny and beautiful. Thank you for sharing your real and a bit darker side, I really appreciate it. I literally never felt that I'd want to be friends with someone I didn't know irl, but you are giving me serious best friend vibes <3. If for whatever reason you'll find yourself wanting to pack your bags and come to Poland - I have an extra couch and I'm officially applying for the role of being someone you know :). PS We can go to Czech Republic as you wanted to move there some time ago, no problem ;)
your not alone I feel the exact same way I used to hold onto the past when I was skinny surrounded by friends and now I let go I'm okay with my chubby self with no pals and I'm also okay with my family and the friends I do have. You can do it Morgan if I'm still staying strong in the exact situation you are, you can too. God will never put a person through something they cant handle.
I feel this girl!!  To anyone who needs to hear this... You are strong, you are beautiful, you are loved!  You can make it through the dark times 🖤💛
Hey Morgan. I am the same way and I have a panic disorder and I feel overwhelmed and will break out crying so much also. I finally found a great doctor and I’m doing TMS therapy now and it’s been the next thing I’ve done. I’m on my 3rd week and I haven’t had a breakdown or cried in awhile now and I feel better and have more energy. Because I also have extreme depression and this therapy is good for people who didn’t react good to medication. It’s truly a great thing I found and I’m so happy for once and can get out of bed and do things with my girls and I’m so excited to feel normal.
use your peloton queen!
Okey, maybe Im not alone. Thank you
Why did YT recommend this video to me today? Cause I needed to hear someone else feeling the same way I do. I hate Mondays but I really like you ❤️
I felt bad that I was laughing while Morgan was having a breakdown
I feel like I'm on the same level as you rn!!
I say this because i love you morgan and i myself was in the same situation. I think you should probably go to therapy, maybe even a psychologist they know what there doing and how to talk to you it might be able to open up your mindset and other possibilities if you give it a chance. I can't be by myself either so i find other options available its hard and quiet scary but there's options girl its been hard for me too knowing im mostly alone and hardly with others& company if you wanna talk more feel free to contact me id be happy to share my experiences with you ❤
Girl I feeeel this.
youre so pretty :)
Okay, so I rarely comment, but I really needed this not to feel alone. I did this to my room last night and had an avalanche of clothes too. It's insane how you posted this video the next day. Just know this video/vlog was genuine and honest. The transparency helps everyone.
Anyone else pissed off at that lady who yelled at her that she’s a “BoTtoM fEeDeR” 😤😡 like who TF ARE YOU??!?
Girl I FEEL YOU! 🙃
We would get along perfectly, like honestly we are the same! I love you beautiful! Keep your head help high I relate so much!!!
Morgan, don't live alone if you get like this. Move in with family and be happy. Life is too short. 💟
I know you weaned yourself off those antidepressants you were on before, but some people just have a chemical imbalance and need to take medication. Finding the right medication worked wonders for me. I’m 36 and have dealt with depression my whole life. In my early 20’s I didn’t want to take medication either, but once I gave in and found one that helped, it helped so much.
Your videos give me LIFE you don’t even know! Love you❤️ also I feel like I’m the exact same way if I’m having a mental breakdown I have to change something in my life or declutter and I agree with everything you said in this video I feel like you’re so open and honest about how you’re feeling it’s so genuine and that’s why I love you❤️
I would literally rather die than have to go to a cycle class. Especially one outside and where I have to socialize with the people around me 😂😂😂
I think you should try to put a little less faith  in the universe
Morgan I will be your friend forever 💞💞💞
Why on earth do you have so many sunglasses lol
I relate to this SO much. Being someone who is so self aware of your mental health is a blessing and a curse.
Sending love your way girl💖
Honestly have been feeling all of these feels the past couple weeks, like I get up and get ready and go to work and I try super hard to live my best life but then I come home and I just feel like idk just like I have nothing figured out and I don’t know if the decision I’m making are the right ones... like watching this really made me feel like my emotions are completely valid and it’s okay to not be okay sometimes.
You are inspiring me to go through all my clothes clutter this weekend ❤️
I feel exactly the same. You are beautifull. In every shot!! And im not just saying that. I feel like you dont belong in LA. And thats fine. Its not running away. You tried. Several times. Live is too short to do things that dont make you happy
Love u so much Morgan stay strong ❤️
I just want to hug you!!  It feels sucky right now, but you are really learning who who are. It's OK to not be OK!! The fact that you're talking about it is good so ypu can get through it! You are strong!!  You can do this! Much love!! 💜
❤❤❤sending love❤❤❤
I don't care if hundreds of people already said it  I'm still going to say it. I hope you give yourself the credit deserved for pushing through your mental crisis the way you did. I know how easy it is to say screw I'm staying in bed, I'm not answering the phone, I'm not doing life right now because I don't feel like it and how hard it is to face the day and get anything at all done. I'm proud of you and I'm proud of anyone else reading this who got whatever it is done,  small or big even though you feel like you can't. Thank you Morgan for sharing this
You’re such an amazing person ❤️ I’m so sorry your week was rough.  Your vulnerability and transparency is what makes you so special and relatable! You’re so damn loved by so many in this community.  If you were in WA state Id fight some fucking bears to be your friend! And by friend I mean person to cry with, eat so much food with, husband hunt at Home Depot with and try and nurture plants with!   Sending all my love and hope that you have a better week ❤️
This is blah. Just move back home.
I'm sending you good vibes, hugs and anything else you need Morgan!
Lol my mental state has been like that for the past year. Except I can't even cry anymore, I don't feel worthy of expressing emotions.
Mate, I RELATE to this, this week in particular! Even down to the manic decluttering whilst feeing rubbish inside, the nostalgia for your life/friends from a few years ago even though most of it has changed, etc <3 It's been a weird one...
I'm glad this week is better for you!
Ugh that makes me so angry! Instructors are supposed to lift you up not tell you you're a bottom feeder/selfish/etc. Sending you a virtual hug Morgan! Let's be friends! ❤️
Love you girly! Ive been feeling like this for 3 years now and im tired of it all 😩 like everything is perfect but not enough ! Idk how to describe it just very empty
Love you Morgan ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Everytime I watch your videos I wish sooo much we could be friends! Sending you much love! 💕
I am like "okay maybe I'm not alone" I know exactly how you feel this is why I love you so much because we are identical personality wise lol
Hi morg love u so, I'm going thru it too I'm 22 with an almost 2 year old single mom here. So let's cry together. It's okay. And about the world forcing you to do something if it's meant for you, it's so TRUE!!!!! Our anxiety holds us back, but if it's meant for us the universe will shove so many things out of our way to find our meaning. ❤️
Thank you for making this video <3
Anyone else want to cry with Morgan because you feel the same? Let’s all cry together ❤️
Hey sweetheart ❤ Jenna Marbles literally took a nap to celebrate a huge milestone and the fans knew deep down she was going through it. We, the viewers, still supported and loved her even when she was clearly depressed. It's ok to feel sad and down and be a real human. You don't need a reason either. It is a normal part of life. There are people who love and support you everywhere. It's going to be ok. I'm a little older than you and I know it's a cliche but life does get easier to navigate the older you get. Be easy and kind to yourself. I was real mean to myself when I was younger and I regret it a lot. I wish I could hug younger me and let myself know that it was going to be ok. I can't do that so I'm going to let you know that it's going to be ok and send a virtual hug. Breathe and when you're sad call your mom and cry it out.
girl,you have a peleton,lockdown meltdown. Next she will cut bangs or dye her pink or blue.
I’m celebrating a year of sobriety on the 19th.. The amount of loneliness I have felt this past year has been unreal. No one wants to be around a sober girl. Everyone wants to drink. Loneliness is hard. And I’m sorry to anyone who has to feel it. I also have social anxiety and anxiety in general mixed with depression and adhd so I like my alone time too but excessive time alone is hard to deal with.
Aw Morgan I just want to give you a big hug 🤗 don't be saddd 🙁 you're seriously the best. You're so funny, smart, entertaining, and that butt.. girlllllll lolol
I know how it feels to have everything you’ve been trying to run away from come at you all at once. It can feel very scary, overwhelming, draining and tiring. But this mental growth and realization of the truth of yourself and your life is so important! and as time goes along as you focus on yourself, you’ll learn to recognize and accept, and then learn how to move on and let go to start anew. like a phoenix rising from the ashes! ❤️ you have the power to put anything you put your heart and soul into. focus on what you want, and the universe will help guide you ❤️ i hope you feel better and don’t give up! ✨
I didn’t realise how much I could relate to your Morgan, it’s been nice having the chance to know you more as you’ve opened up more and more on this channel. You can now find support here from those that will understand you most. You’re not alone, I thought I was but what you were saying was as if every single word was taken perfectly out of my mouth. You’re a different kind of soul, a soul not many, and sometimes even you can understand it’s all part of the gruelling journey Morgan. Love yourself, accept that you have to accept to love yourself, the most fucked up relationship you will ever have in your life is with yourself but it’s also the most damn awarding even if only for those magical moments. Sending loving energy to you x
Love you Morgan. I wish I was as motivated and able-bodied as you are. I need to throw away a lot of stuff I have too, but I have a chronic illness that steals my energy and drive away by making me hurt a lot. I hope you're feeling more content and less upset now xxooxx
This is hella relatable
❤️ I feel you sister 😥 We're all here for you, you're not alone ❤️
My twenties were ALL LIKE THIS.  It was so hard. I was relieved when I turned 30 and it felt like I'd turned a corner.  It got better. It will get better. Hang in there. <3
I’ve never related to a video so much, thanks for sharing this with us. It’s nice knowing that we aren’t the only ones going through this. You are amazing 💕
We need exercise classes for introverts and people with anxiety, autism, etc. Dim lights, soft voices, gentle music, everyone wearing horse blinders so we can't see each other.
♡
omg I need that white jacket
You’re doing all the right things ❤️ getting rid of things that no longer serve you. Keep trusting the universe. Also try reading the book “The Universe has Your Back” by gabby Bernstein. Also it’s on audible. 💗
I resonate with this video sm. Thank you for being vulnerable with us. I needed this today❤
I’m so proud of you and I am so happy that you shared this with others! It’s easy to dismiss the WORD depression, but you are fighting the fight against depression and winning! Good role model!
I’m similar Morgan but other way round like I get used of being around people then we go back lockdown and I get used of being alone and just going outside w my parents and I go back to school and I just can’t cope or when people ask me to go out I just can’t face it🤍😫but we will do this I love you- I’m from uk that’s why we still got lockdown
I feel like we can relate to wanting to be alone but not feel alone. Introvert life. 😩
Morgan you are so beautiful wow
I’ve gone through most of the pandemic alone and that has fucked with my head in ways I never thought it would. It’s so hard. Letting go and moving on is so hard. But you can do hard things! Sending love ❤️
Morgan you look great! Your doing it. Just sit and appreciate all your hard work. I'm enough! Your enough! We're enough! Type of vibe.
Morgan, move away from toxic LA.  Even if you move to San Diego or North of LA, you will still be near Ryland.  Or move to CO and talk Ryland into switching off visiting each other every other month.  You need to do what's best for you and your mental health. 💜
Morgan, what you're describing is exactly how I felt for years. Sometimes it was less severe, sometimes it was awful and I couldn't even make myself go out and spent most of the day crying, lonely and feeling useless. The advice I can give for long term solution is to first go to therapy every week and if you don't get better after some time (and a good therapist will point it out!) you should go get diagnosed and/or go see a psychiatrist so they can help you find the right medication! These feelings of feeling empty and sad do not define you! It's not your fault you have those, it just needs to be treated like any other illness you'd go see a doctor about. I'm sending you a lot of love! Stay strong!💕
I’ve recently gone through the process of getting help for my suicidal tendencies and it’s been incredibly rough ( hell i lost a friend because of it ) thank you for sharing this Morgan it’s encouraged me to move forward ❤️ and to anyone who reads this remember your a strong , amazing individual :)
I get it.. it's really hard..  But for sure it'll be okay
Morgan, you are the most relatable influencer/youtuber ever. I just want to hug you when you’re down and tell you everything will be okay because I’ve been there too and then laugh with you because your videos are always so entertaining. Take care ❤️
found out today I hate seeing Morgan cry :,) I BURSTED into tears seeing her so sad
Morgan, you are not alone, I feel the same
Honestly its so refreshing to see someone actually talk about something openly that other people are also feeling and it somehow helps to know that it’s not just you and I love you for that Morgan
I fee like your will be 10x more happier getting that apartment in Denver and being closer to home
MORGAN MY FELLO LEO! I FUCKING ADORE YOU LIKE U BETTER BE A LEO COZ YOU GIVING LEO VIBES
Hugs Morgan
I know you probably won’t see this but honestly when you said you have been living out of your suitcase for 2 months and you were happy all I could think about is how you maybe should look into a tiny home 🤷🏻‍♀️ but I think not like an in place tiny home. Like one you can hook up to a truck and bring to CO when needed. And not like a RV or Camper. Like an actual minimalist tiny home. You can park it wherever you want to be. If LA is making you feel down go out to the mountains. No one said to be a YT’er you have to live in CA. Look at all the wonderful ones who are making it that live somewhere else? Like Cristine and Ben, Corrine and Rob. Heck, Safiya and Tyler got out of CA. Sometimes you have to do what’s right for you and find your path to happiness 🙏🏻❤️
Can we just talk abt how she wasn’t in the right state of mind but she looks so fucking beautiful🥺 but love u morgan🥺💜
Once you learn to love and value yourself, it gets better but does take time.
You are not alone  Morgan  we are here with you 🧡
Yeah.....get a dog
Your brain is always eavesdropping on your thoughts 💭 be careful with negative thoughts. Your thoughts are the key out of a depression. This is coming from a momma who was 223 pounds and now down to 143 and finally beat my Severe depression. Also watch joe dispenza on YouTube... changed my life.
Girlfriend! Get out of LA! You were so much happier in CO with your family. You’ve already said that the main reason for staying in LA was because of Ryland, but is it worth your mental health? Ryland goes to CO pretty often, so you’ll still see him. You can always visit him like you do CO now. ❤️
Thank you for sharing this with us. I struggle a lot, there are things that started way in the past, but since my bf broke up with me in September, things got seriously worse. Not even cause of the break up cause like it was toxic from both sides really, but i got into a space where I’m too aware of all my problems but I’m unable to fight my demons. And really seeing that others struggle too but are still fighting and standing up again and again make me wanna push through and stand up and keep going. Even if just a little, but still. Thank you ❤️
Morgan: I’m feeling good. *cries* omg Btw I love u hope ure doing better, and also most of these glasses looked pretty on u
I‘m an instructor myself and i would never NEVER do that 🥺
Girl ... same 🙌🏽
If ever in crisis, don’t go to soul cycle. Got it ✅🤣
You need roommates.
Hi Morgan! Thank you for sharing this part of you. It really helps people like me, who is also in their 20s and feeling lonely and hasn’t found their direction.
I felt that emptiness you’re feeling until I found God and my purpose in him. Maybe that’s what you’re missing in your life. I know you’re not religious, but please give it a try and see if you feel different! Try going to church and praying it’s truly so comforting 💜
I love you. And you need to get some help. Please tell me your seeking counselling. You will raise yourself back up
morgan i would love to suggest for you to wear black tourmaline, it’s supposed to protect empaths. by shielding negative energy away ❤️
It’s ok to have these days and feel how you feel. Love to you ♥️♥️
Morgan, my heart aches for you! I often feel this way, so relatable! I too go from activity to activity that I know bring me joy, and in the Moment feel like, damn I should be enjoying this, and then feel guilty that I’m not. I’m in LA I feel like we could literally hang, super weird but seriously 😅
This video perfectly summed up how i feel/felt moving away from my family and friends im 3 years out and its hard i hope it gets better
"The universe is guiding me in a specific direction and smetimes in order to do that, it has to take a lot away from you." Girl this is so true! It is! You can't have good days without bad, you can't have ups without downs. It's gotta balance out. It'll be okay. ❤
16:04 morgan, you're not alone in this feeling <3 i've felt like this a lot recently too... it started around fall time last year and comes and goes in waves... and it's scary because i have struggled a lot with depression and anxiety since 7th grade (i'm 25 now) and after many years of hell, i finally feel okay and hopeful again. but then i get these periods in which everything feels so heavy and difficult, and i get really scared that i'll slip back into a depression. i've worked so hard to get out of it.  but i also trust that it will pass. and i'll be ok. it's just a process i have to get through in order to be free of past trauma. everything passes eventually, we just have to do our best until it gets better again <3 thank you for sharing
Comparison is the thief of Joy. I'm hoping that you find your value and worth within yourself and thru God. Check out "The Chosen". Really good series and might help.
You are so beautiful❤️
I completely feel where you are, I’ve been feeling the same way. I wish the best for you, you deserve nothing but happiness! Girl but for reals you should live in CO! I live in Aurora too and you’ll always have someone to talk to if needed! Also my bf’s family has a ranch in Parker, and you can visit the alpacas :)
Healing is not linear! Supporting you from afar and so inspired by you ♥️
It will get better!!!
I'm relieved to see an update. You've been on my mind for the past two weeks. Morgan you are a beautiful soul with a hilarious spirit- we LOVE you 💗 sending you all good vibes.
love you girly 💜
You and me are literally the same person, and you need to get out of LA babe.
Hang in there young lady. You have your whole life ahead of you and things WILL get better!
Omg Morgan i just wanna hug you girl! Just remember that you are so LOVED. Thank you for sharing your vulnerability.
Girl I am in the same boat as you are. If you want an internet friend I’m here!! Maybe you should do live streams sometimes? If you are worried about hate comments maybe you could start a patreon that way the live stream is just your supporters? It could be a fun way to talk to people and be social
Girl, get yourself together! You are smart, beautiful and important. You don't need friends to be validated. This is the time to immerse yourself in a career or a hobby. The more you get out friends will be made. Reach deep down, figure out who you are and make a life. Some people would kill for your life and everything you have. We all break sometimes and hit rock bottom, but, you have to put your big girl pants on and start rising! Quit comparing your life to others. Life is really what you make of it. Make your own decisions and don't worry about what people think of you.
Love how your talking about your emotional and mental health openly it is very refreshing. I also like to clean and organize when I am down. Things that are broken or have no use )except seasonal items) to me great bad energy and just bring you down. Wishing you the best girlie. Luv ya 🤗
I appreciate how raw you are about how you are feeling. I’ve been feeling very similar to this and this video reminded me that I am not alone.   I too am simp nation and feel hard. It makes things rough sometimes.
Uff i felt your pain :( everything is gonna be better bigg hugg from Monica and Amabelle
Morgan you need to start meditating. START YOUR SPIRITUAL JOURNEY GURL!!!
I love you Morgan. You are strong. You matter. Sending you a virtual hug. I feel like you and I are similar down to the fibro. We could vibe we could be friends.
My God Morgan I cry with you, I laugh with you, I sympathise with you. You are not alone I don't have enough space to type what I am going through. It breaks my heart to see you cry. Your so beautiful inside and out!From one stranger to another. I love you❤
I lived along for 2 years during university and I feel your pain, every word so true. I feel incredibly grateful you share these feelings and your experience. Sending you all the love❤
What you were saying while you were sat there in your beautiful red dress, man that was like you were speaking from my brain. It helps to know others feel it too, in some selfish way. I hope things get better soon for you 🖤
You’re so enjoyable 💜 thanks for sharing  And I liked those first jeans. Just sayin 😎
Please start a Depop, I think that could be a good place for you to sell all those clothes/ random things you don't want anymore. I would totally buy lol
Bullied at soul cycle, none of that is okay.  Sending well wishes to everyone xo
That red dress on you is stunning 😍
I never related to a vlog more 💕💕💕
The last half of March really got me struggling. You are not alone Morgan!! I’m glad to read the comments and see that I am also not alone.
maybe you should get a roommate girl!! no shame in living with friends
Thank you for sharing. You probably don't realize how much you talking about it helps.
It's so hard to describe that feeling! I feel it too - you're not alone 🤍
omggg i just wanna come over, bake some cookies, drink some tequila and watch some horror movies. glad you're feeling better now.
Umm I burst into tears during an online exam the other day lmao. From one sad bitch to another, we gonna be alright.
You’re not alone ❤️
I feel like you and I had our mental breakdowns during the same week because I recently had the weirdest saddest week of my life too, got to this dark place in my head. And like you said, give it a few days and you’ll feel a lot better, not completely healed but at least better. I also struggled a lot with wanting a lot of things to be the same or go back to how things used to be with my friends and family and it just will never be the same and it’s hard to accept that but eventually with time, you move on and create new memories with new people. It’s so hard but we can do this, hang in there! ❤️
I got an idea come live my life and I’ll live yours and we’ll see how you feel after yea?
Morgan, thank you so much for posting this and being vulnerable with us. I’ve also been really struggling this week and have been beating myself up for it, but this really reassured that’s it’s okay to not be okay all the time. I’m with you girly, it’ll get better💞 love you you 🥺❤️
I'm currently at like my lowest low right now and I have NO idea why. Videos like this really helps me feel a little less insane❤️ I appreciate you
Morgan, everyone is struggling with the state of the world as it stands now, and it makes us feel empty and worthless in our weak moments.  You are working things out and will be/are a good example of being true to yourself and being honest.  You are a beautiful person inside and out and the world is better because you are in it ! ❤️
Girl you’re not alone, thanks for sharing such  vulnerable moments, you will never know how much and how many you’ve just helped! Sending prayers and positive thoughts 🤗
Thank you for this.
Morgan is so gorgeous, and Morgan I'm so deeply proud of you. Thank you for being here, your soul is so empathetic and you're so worthy, never forget that. You are loved, things will get better. Having to do things with mental health draining you is really hard; trust me ik. Thank you for sharing this with us, we are all here for you and rooting for you. We love you. :)
I needed this today
Vacation, take a week or two and just drive. See where you end up.
I had no idea other people (especially Morgan) struggle just like I do
I hate hearing you say you only slightly feel pretty. Morgan, you are drop dead gorgeous! You may not believe it but you are so so beautiful! Your hair is nice, your eyes are stunning and beautiful, your face overall is so so pretty! Your body is goals, if I looked anything like you I would be so happy, you’re so blessed! Also your room, your home, your style. It’s so clean and pure and pretty, your style is classy and you’re literally such an inspiration! Please be happy, please love yourself.
TIGHT VIRTUAL HUG TO YOU MORGAN! YOU REALLY ARE AN AMAZING HUMAN, ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT! YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Morgan! Feel pretty everyday queen slay you’re so fucking beautiful. You’re just naturally beautiful. Inside and out.
Girl you just need to move closer with your mom and grandma, it’s obvious that your happier closer with them and you are not okay in LA.
Girl you and half the world. I hear ya
I once had a similar experience about letting go of something. I had to make a decision that I knew would make me happy, but I had to let go of other things that weren't making as happy as they used to. And the thing is that I only thought of the happy memories and the great times I had with the thing I had to let go, but I wasn't realizing that it didn't make the same effect on me anymore. So I made the decision of letting it go after a friend recommended me doing a comparison of pros a cons of the thing, and after I did that, and cried my soul out I could finally take the decision and I'm so glad I did it. I can tell you now that I became happier than I was, but I know it is hard and I know it is sad, but I promise that when you think of yourself first you'll be happier <3  (hopefully you understand what I tried to say because I feel it was confusing lol)
Thank you for being so honest with us!We all gonna get through this bullshit time together 🖤
Rylan should build you a Tiny house in his Yard so you can live there. Its ok not to be ok.
It will get better Morgan! Keep your head up ♥️
Morgan “ this will be a yes or no system.” Also Morgan “maybe 🤷🏻‍♀️”
I appreciate you being so open and honest and I hope that you will be able to let go of what is keeping you down💗
So sorry you go through this! ❤️ hope there comes more positive time’s ahead 😍
I miss DC so much they have very few shoes left.
“Everything is okay.” Crying. Me though
I wish we were real life friends, I’m going through the same thing right now, I keep telling myself I can regrow my life and completely start over and I don’t know where to live and I’m just so lost and sad about it all, sending you good vibes ❤️❤️
Morgan you’re gorgeous 😍😍 and those jeans looked AMAZING on you 💕💕
Thank you for opening up like that. It was nice to hear that I’m not the only one who’s feeling this way constantly. Hang in there 💚
You are beautifully unique and of great value to this world.This you should understand and always hold foremost  in your kind soul and minds eye; always remember this.
Red is 💯 your color!! You look stunning in that dress! Also, I’m all for decluttering, but how do you look so good in like every pair of sunglasses?! Please don’t get rid of all of them!!
I hate to see you this way but you’re stunning and such a beautiful person and you’re not alone
I seriously relate to you. You are not alone.
Maybe replace the word “universe” with God and seek fulfillment in Him.... sounds so cliche I know, just something to think about 🥰 love you girl
I know all to well how you are feeling and it is nice to know that we are all not alone in this. ❤ you
i comment this all the time but i watch your vlogs and i SWEAR if we knew each other in real life we would be best friends. cheering you on always ❤️
breaks my heart to know other people feel like this too because I know I’d never wish it on anyone
I love you Morgan!! I want to be your friend ❤️❤️❤️👯‍♀️👯‍♀️👯‍♀️
Thank you for being so real & raw. There are so many of us feeling exactly the same way, so please never think you’re alone. You are ALWAYS worth it & you are so loved. Keep going queen, this feeling is only temporary ❤️
I feel like this a lot. For a good two weeks sometimes. But once you get out of it you’re as happy as ever but when you’re down it’s the lowest of lows.   You got this. Just take a breath and remind yourself pain is temporary no matter the magnitude.   I say move back to CO, you look so incredibly happy there. Every video you make back home you are glowing. It’s okay to admit LA isn’t where you want to be right now. Just my opinion, we all support you!   🥺🤍
Prayers!! 💓 God is good all the time and all the time God is good!
I am glad you posted this Morgan. You are strong. I understand how you are feeling. As a 24 year old graduate student, struggling with depression, eating disorder and trying to stay afloat. I am sending a hug to you from the east cost. <3
Morgan your beautiful 😍 like girllllll your my woman crush every day 😌💜🤣
Morgan, My heart broke for you when you started crying. I wish you would fly back home to your parents or stay with Ryland and Shane until things ease up with Covid. I just think you're so much happier when you're surrounded by family.
i have never related to someone more.
I'm also struggling with being alone. I''m in my first year of college and I live alone in a big city and it can get really hard sometimes.
I love you! ❤️ I hope everything turns out well for you!
You are such an amazing person and i cant explain how much i appreciate your videos and honesty ❤️ your friends are so lucky to have you as their friend💕
It's insane how similar we can all be and find eachother through social media. You are one of the people I watch for comfort videos because I resignate with you so much, then I come to the comments and there are so many others that say the same things. It just baffles me. We are here for you love!❤💕
"Now it's a lot harder to make friends." Yeah, it gets harder as you get older and I know your circumstance is quite unique on top of that. You're not alone in that and I hope you can hold your head high as you move onto the next thing. A big thing I learned as I got older is that you're never going to get precisely what you want, the way you wanted it but in the end, it's for the best most of the time.
Jeebus, Soul Cycle. Get your people in check.
You are literally GORGEOUS. I love you.
hang in there morgan ❤ you're doing good 😘 we're all here for you ❤
I'm also having one of them weeks 😓😓😓😓
Morgan please look at graham stephan - but a house - re do it - then DONT SELL - rent it out - you will get a steady income for later
You’ve always been an incredible person, but it’s been amazing to watch you in the last year and see how much you have grown as a person. You are such a beautiful soul, truly. I’m so sorry you’re struggling. I’m 41 now, but when I was your age and throughout my 20’s it was SO. HARD. You will get through this. It gets better, trust me. I know it’s cliche and not helpful in the moment, but I promise you, this too shall pass. Keep kicking ass. You’re doing great, sweetie.
Thank you for being real 💕
I think you should consider moving, you seem to thrive in other places. I get being by yourself is hard but being in a place you don’t love by yourself is harder! You are doing great at figuring out what works best for you ❤️ sending all the positive vibes and love ☀️😊
ugh i wanna be your friend!!!!!!
I soo hear you- sending positive vibes.....
I’m 38 years old and have these days too. I wish I could say after you feel this way, it can only get better. Just remember life is hard and we’ve always been taught “we aren’t given more than we can handle.” Well, we weren’t all told how hard it can get and how heavy these times in life feel. Thank you for being so vulnerable and honest! Some days are dark, but remember the light eventually starts to shine through.
YOU SAID NO TO ALL THE GOOD PAIRS OF SUNGLASSES
Morgan you should buy succulents 🙌🏻 they’re low maintenance haha and very cute 🥰
Try a dog! Nothing cured my "living alone depression" more than a being that's life truly revolves around you. Someone who is happy when you come home, someone who takes up some of your bed when you sleep, someone that protects you! But the best part? They think your tears are yummy so if you're crying, you get kisses, that in turn make you feel better☺️🥰
I’m always confused when Morgan says it’s hard for her to make friends cuz I’m like WHO WOULDNT WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH MORGAN??
Morgan, maybe some videos from Teal Swan might help.
I related to this so much... thank you for sharing.  Love you Morgan.  You'll get through this.❤️
I cried so much watching this because it’s so relatable to my life! You are so brave to be so open with the world, if there were more people like you I really do not think there would be so much pressure to ‘live the perfect life’ xxxx
Oh Morgan, get to a doctor. You are not stupid. You might need medication. It sounds like you are having the worst anxiety attack EVER!! Please go ASAP. You are amazing and beautiful. You don’t have to figure out everything alone. ❤️
I love you Morgan keep your head up only youtuber i dont skip ads for  You are amazing. Keep your head up
You should the Marie Kondo method. It actually works.
I’m also having a very hard time with my mental health. It’s like a rollercoaster lately.
That’s depression, babe.  I rarely have a tangible reason to feel “sad” but I feel it anyway.  At any time.  Talking about it helps a lot.  You’re doing great.  And that red dress is IT!
We can swap places for a week im a no body and work in a Highschool barely making the $ and still live with my parents 🥺
First, YOU LOOK STUNNING!!! Secondly, I feel you.
Morgan you are such a beautiful light filled soul! I feel in my opinion you need to move back to your home town you seem so much happier there!!! I hope you find happiness and peace within yourself you are deserving! You are strong and you are loved!❤
I relate to the feeling that something is missing so much! Like I try so hard to distract myself but things don’t feel the same as they used to!😔
i love you morgan
That took some guts to post and I can totally relate to you ! Thank you for being honest and just being you ! Ps the dress was fab on you ❤️ also some of the jeans were really nice on you! Maybe keep some of them !
I can empathize with everything you say in this video. I also feel like I have a great life that I'm thankful for and I know I'm blessed with so much but I do hold onto things too much and my mental health suffers for it. It's so difficult to go through your days feeling like something isn't quite right but you just don't know how to even start trying to fix it. Know that you're not alone Morgan and that you're doing the best you can. We are all too hard on ourselves these days and need to remember to give ourselves a break. 💜
Soft hugs. It sounds like you are feeling raw, like everything is exposed and so intense. When we are by ourselves we dont have the distractions of other people to keep us from our thoughts. Itis harder to bury and run away from them and the feelings they cause. That's okay.  And it is also okay that you think and feel things you thought you let go of. Think of yourself walking on a spiral path. When you let something go, you really do let it go and walk away from it. However, something might bring it up again but because you let it go, it might not  hurt as much this time or it might hurt the same, or you make a new realization of it. That's okay, that's you working through a new facet of an old issue and when you have, and when you let that part go, walk away, the pain will be less.all healing and good things, self growth, take time and work. It is a very hard when you are in the thick of it, but, Morgan, you are a beautiful person, kind, empathetic, and you are trying and putting one foot in front of the other. Might not seem like it, but I rather think that makes you a warrior. And you know what, taking some time to work through things, that's okay, and healthy, even if it doesn't seem like it.  Hugs, you are amazing!
I literally said yes to all the sunglasses she said no to lol
Thanks for being vulnerable and real. It makes me feel less alone :)
I literally been feeling the exact way. My crying starting the min. yours did cause I felt all that. I feel alone most the time and idk why cause I think I’m a good person too. But your video I feel better knowing I’m not alone. May the Universe bless us!
I really needed to hear this today, I’ve been feeling exactly the same. ❤️
It was therapeutic to hear someone able to voice everything I’ve been feeling you are not alone
EVERY SINGLE PAIR OF SUNGLASSES U SAID NO TO I SAID YESSSSSS!!!
Thank u for sharing I've been crying alot lately I just turned 43 I have no romantic prospects still haven't had the babies I've wanted my whole life I have lupus and chronic pain. Noone is ever going to love me w all the other things and the pandemic has really made me realize how alone and lonely I am😭😭 praying for u, u r a very good person so sweet genuine beautiful on the inside and out. I'd die to have a friend like u. And I'm proud of u for cleaning out everything in ur closet and u look beautiful in ur red dress🥰💗🥰 love u beautiful 😍💗💖❤💓
Depression is so hard! Keep getting up everyday. It’ll get better. Depression never lasts forever but it really sucks when you feel like you’re doing all the things that are supposed to help and it’s still there.
If someone ever asks me what I’m going through I’m just going to show this video because you explained it so well. Hope you feel better soon and do what is best for you🥰 the comments might suggest moving to Colorado but follow your heart and what you think is best!
you are brave but you also need support, don't push you too far, if you feel better in CO just go there! dont think too much, just do what makes you feel better. see you like this opens my eyes to see how I look and It's not cool
A quay kaweennnnnnnnn
Girl this is me!!! I’m better than I was because I can actually get out of bed now, but I still don’t feel right. It feels like I’m not living the life I’m supposed to be living. I’m hoping there is something good waiting for us!
I want to be your friend. We are the same
I feel these days often.. it's tough to keep going and power through. Take care of yourself. Find what sparks joy and grow that in abundance. :) Thank you for sharing your venerable moments. We are here for you and feel the same girl. Your not alone and your brave, beautiful, and powerful for sharing your truths.
Morgan is someone I definitely want to be best friends with. 💜❤️
I relate to you so much.
Someone telling you to give someone else your energy or your a bottom feeder is toxic! Protect your energy all the time!! That trainer was toxic af I’m sorry that happened to you.
Where’s the depop @
I honestly wish things were better for all of us were struggling so fucking much I hate living this life
Morgan sounds like you are having depression and anxiety taking control of you.  I hope you can see someone and maybe get something to help through this.  Maybe get a room mate too.  A very close friend.   I feel you. I could be just fine and then the next minute I have debilitating anxiety which gives me depression.  Please see sometime that can help you get through this ❤️🙌💕🙏
The universe is a bitch
You are so beautiful and strong <3
I'm so proud that you've opened up about your experiences; but, please know that you're not alone. It takes a lot of vulnerability to open up about your emotions, but I definitely resonate with some of you explanations and I don't know why we all seem to feel this way. <3 really love you and will always be here to talk if you want!
Nobody needs to bring DC back lol love you though Morgan
Oh honey. Your beautiful, interesting, intelligent and you are a light in so many people’s world. Just saying ❤️
“No, no...no, just no...should I wear this to the store right now?” 🤭 that’s why I love you
This is the MOST relatable content.
Lol not to sound like everyone else in these comments but are we the same person....
I actually really liked her in the jeans yet I relate and prefer leggings 😂
You’re only a few months older than I am, and I have a roommate. Took me a while to find someone I was chill with but it’s so much better, you’re in a different city in a apartment by yourself that’s A LOT for anyone. If I didn’t have a roommate I would most definitely go insane here by myself. My anxiety alone would just eat me alive.
hey morgan, I hope you see this.. I am going through a lot of similar things and emotions that you are going through as well rn. I’m 24, starting a new chapter in my life by now living by myself, making friends is hard etc etc. I just felt the need to comment & see if u wanted to ever talk, maybe even be friends. my insta @blakelyquinnn
❤️❤️❤️
15:43 omfg you're so gorgeous :O
I appreciate her so much for posting this I’ve been in the same spot I couldn’t help but cry with Morgan 😩🤣
Dealing with depression is hard. Please, reach out for help. Sending you love ❤️
LA doesn’t deserve you. ❤️
I just want to say. As a person who is going through something similar as you are, you do a really great job at coping with it. It can be hard to be in those mindsets and choose not to turn to more self-destructive ways of coping with it. So please be proud of yourself for handling it in a healthier way. It's genuinely something to be proud of.
Girl, you right. We all just gotta sit back and say “it just be like that sometimes”  If I was in Cali I would 100% be your friend. We struggling out here sis
Morgan, perhaps you should consider moving back to Colorado? Peace is what I wish for you.
I needed this. I've felt like such a mess and am glad to know I'm not alone ❤
we all love and support you!! please take care of yourself ♥️
awww Morgan I love you girl. I live a state away but I volunteer to be a friend! so now you have one more :) You are literally one of the coolest ladies I've ever come across in my life and thats saying something haha keep your beautiful head up. You're a goddess.
We love you, Morgan!! ♥️
honestly SO relatable
Wow. This is so raw. Morgan, explaining the emptiness was so accurate and painfully real.
First of all, your ass looked great in evry single pair of jeans you tried on. And second of all i dont think i've ever related more to what you say after 16:06. You are deifnitely not alone in this feeling, and you are super strong in recognising these feelings and working through them, and fighting through them, trying not to let them stop you from anything. That makes you incredibaly strong and brave. And please don't ever stop wanting to being the best yo you can be.
You’re an amazing person. Keep being strong ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for this Morgan. You really did make me feel less alone. I hope we will both be better soon❤️
This video reminded me of me two years ago. Just wanna say that looking back it’s not about finding and attaining new friends or hanging onto what you hoped for a certain version of yourself - it’s about hanging onto and being with the people who you love and love you the most. Everything else is confetti  ❤️
California gives you mental breakdowns. Just live in Colorado.
I feel you on everything including bringing DC back
I can literally relate to Morgan so much. Especially when we’re the same age and I feel like she’s happier and in a better mind space in her hometown. Same with me.
Dont find love in places people...  Love yourself ❤
i just want to give you a big hug ❤
Holy. Shit. Thank you so much for posting this. I feel like most YouTibers, influences, cool kids, whoever they are would not post anything this raw or real and fuck man....we need it.
morgan cures my depression. i love u beautiful
I love you Morgan ! Hold on the best is yet to come !
I needed this vlog so badly. I'm somewhere between crying in my eggs and the emotions in my party dress, but at least I feel a little less alone💜
Morgan your life is just as much of a mess as mine and not to sound weird but it gives me so much comfort. 💗
Get a lemon tree and make homemade lemonade you know?
I feel all of this so hard!! You are not alone in this weird, odd and exhausting season of life. You've got this!!!!
I think you should get out of California, you and your soul need someplace better.. you were genuinely happier even in colorado.
You’ve no idea how much I wish we could be friends. I’m the other side of the world with a totally different life to you, not far apart in age but everything you said are like literal thoughts my weird little cognitive process has strung together.  Have the best day and know you will have SO MANY days that make the unbearable ones worth it. 🖤
Dude uh why would I feel like we would be besties
So many YouTubers are moving away from LA saying it's super toxic and I'm starting to think there's something to that...  Anytime I have had to repeatedly tell myself I'm "okay" while I cry, I've had to make a big change. I cried with her because that's such a shitty state to be in. 💔 Morgan keep bouncing back, you got this!!!!
that moment when u know  u're not alone and not the only one who's depressed
You are NOT ALONE girlfriend!!! I felt everything you said so unbelievably DEEP in my soul!!! Stay strong huni you'll get through this! We're all here for you. And you have a wonderful fam and friends for support and a shoulder to lean on. Xo 💜
me sitting here in front of my laptop crying with morgan is oddly therapeutic
Thank you for sharing your struggles. It helps me feel less lonely. :)
Thank you, Morgan, for this vlog. You, speaking about your emotions, feelings and how you are doing throu your days means a lot for me. I feel like someone finally spoke about what is all the time in my mind. Thank you, this means a lot. Love you <3
thank you for opening up!!! love how real this channel feels ❤
Ohh my goodness Morgan, I felt what you’re going through in such a deep level!!! I have a home, a good boyfriend, my family and our health and I still felt such a deep hole and I didn’t know why or what was missing, I felt shitty for feeling shitty! Especially when you have people telling you you have so much to be happy for!! Thankfully I’m at a better place now. Thank you for showing what some of us go through! 🖤
you look AMAZING in that red dress!!! <33
I feel like everything that happened with Shane effected her too because she lost garret, Andrew and other people and people look at her differently maybe even though she’s such the purest soul and deserves all the happiness
you're not alone Morgan I get it. You are so strong <3
I don't know if you believe in God but my be you should talk to him about everything IT WILL GET BETTER
morgan: imma keep this a simple yes or no system also morgan: *MAYBE*
Morgan, thank you so much for sharing such a raw and real video with the world. I too have been struggling lately, and I have my peaks and my valleys. It just helps to not feel so alone, like wow I’m not crazy other people feel this way to! We will all get through this, be kind to yourself, you are very loved even when it doesn’t feel that way. Sending love, and positive energy❤️
I respect that you’re opening up this much.
Literally me and Morgan had an emotional break down together! We are amazing and thank you for this video!! ❤️
I’m so sorry you’re  going through this beautiful
Jesus heals. Stay strong babe 💕
Oh Morgan I know you wont see this but I'm gonna put it anyway. i wish i could just hug you and tell you how beautiful you are both the inside and outside. Days will get better and you will feel happiness and joy again. Crying and talking about it is fantastic and the 1st step to getting over the depth of your feelings right now. If this feeling gets worse please seek professional help there is no shame in it and id like to say Thank you for being truly open to your fan Thank you for putting this here so people who feel the same know their not alone.
I’ve missed you. Glad you uploaded today. I needed this 💕 ☮️
9:07 and I’m about to cry myself. Just so you know I feel that way all the time and your videos really help me not feel so alone. You da best Morgan. 🥺💕
Morgan ii lovee youu girll💕💕youu aree soo hardworking and you are really making so much effort to make things work I WISH EVERYTHING YOU ARE GIVES YOU INNER PEACE AND HAPPINESS !!!!LOVE LOVE💕💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️
You are not alone. Proud of you for speaking about a hard subject for a lot of young women.
Sounds like you just need a roommate
Her crying made my heart ache so bad 💔
For some reason , no matter how crappy morgan says she feels or her life is i’m always like, hm i look up to her. idk why but i just love morgan so much and look up to her✋🏻
Went to a new dance class today. I usually love dancing, today was help wanted to smash the other students head, was a mess and wanted to scream when it was finished.
I love your videos and feel your pain. You might want to go to a place that feeds your soul. You feel better in CO.... maybe spend time with gramma, she sure makes me happy lol. I think someone said to maybe get a small fixer upper in CO. might be something to look forward to xxxx Loves youuuu
I have “it be like that sometimes” tattooed on my calf. Bc it really do be like that.. sometimes
Aww sweetheart you are such a beautiful human. Hope you feel better very soon. Sending love and cwtches from Wales, UK xxxxx
I'm so sorry you're feeling this way, Morgan . You're definitely not alone in it and you'll definitely come out on the other side and I really hope that happens soon. Sending you lots of love and light. Oh and Soul Cycle in LA is from the devil himself, I'm absolutely sure of it.
Girl I’m literally laying in the bathtub, fully clothed, drinking red wine in the dark. I’m glad I don’t feel alone :) lol (I tried to clean my house and freaked out 🤪🤪)
Take it day by day. Just do some self care & relax don’t think about others or the world
I’m going through it to Morgan you’re not alone 🙏🙌🥺❤️
Everything you are feeling..I have been feeling as well. I go to my primary dr tomorrow and I'm gonna ask him if I have some sort of anxiety or depression. I've been struggling for months and not wanting to bring that topic up because I feel that's admitting that I am a crazy person and I dont want to be labeled as crazy.
im sorry if im over stepping here but Morgan, you have depression, you might already know it but a few years ago i also have it, i gave birth and then hit me like a truck, i feel all that you are feeling right now and feel like a living failure because i was a mom and i just broke, when you say that you cry when the sunset comes, i really feel it, i did to, every single sunset, and just push me, day after day giving my best, doing my best and then because of it all i could think is how "casualy" kill myself, im not saying this is gonna happen to you but i really think you should go see a professional, a real one and talk it through, because your family always gonna be with you, your friends too but when you get home and all you can feel is the void in your body, no one or any place can really fill that but yourself, sorry if this is not helpful im just worried and im sending you all the wishes that you feel better
Im 30 now, and i was so depressed about 5 years ago and feeling that i didnt have anything in my own hands. my days was just i was feeling so hopeless and chaotic and i was cinda afraid that im gonna lose my mind. Feel like u are too very sensitive and empthatic Person. Im an emphat. Give yourself time. Life is really not about crying or being just fucked up sad everyday.. U get over everything u can humans are strong and your heart knows was best for here. My depression/panic attacks started when i haved to stop seeing my friends and i have to move, everything changed i was so not having it, living in the past and just like u said holding on things. I didnt know anyone and started school again and the feeling was just like i was doing something that i didnt actually want. Hold on your family and everything that makes u feel better they really care sooooo much more than u think.
me just having a sob session with this video rn because i don’t have actual friends to cry with
Thank you for being so real and honest. 💜💜💜
You are my spirit animal 🤣💕
Yikes, can you move out of L.A.?
I don't know you personally and I don't know your life, but judging by your vlogs and what you choose to show us of yourself, you seem 10x happier in Colorado. Like I said, I don't know your life; that's just my observation and if I were your friend, I would tell you to move back home for the sake of your mental health and well being. We, your audience, adore and care for you!
Girl Same 🤍
Thank you for being so open about how you feel! I‘m sorry that you‘ve been feeling that way tho but I‘m wishing you all the strength to get through it!! You will get there for sure!!!👏🏼 No rain, no flowers🌸 (very corny I know😩 but it‘s the truth😂)
Sending all the love and positive vibes your way. I’ve definitely had these days of darkness, and completely feel this. Never a bottom feeder, and it’s okay to be just the way your are. Actually, it’s great the way you are. Love you girl!!!
Oh Sweetie... i feel you on the “social aspect” of life/making friend’s and such... i use to be very outgoing, and now i just want to stay at home as most as possible. 😅 I alway’s lowkey crave to go out and make new friend’s/talk, but i hate my anxiety // i think i sound stupid when i speak 🥴 (i feel like LOL.) 😅
I am 14 years old and when I hang out with my friends I enjoy it but it’s sad to now they will leave you and move on at one point so you have to think of the good side of it all I am so sorry for you Morgan and I hope you feel better soon and enjoy your memories ♥️♥️♥️🤗🤗
Love you morgan!! 💖💖 thank you so much for your transperancy
See may be it's the vibe of the house...its not you... The energy of a place affects us
Morgan u are so loved by so many people! Your vlogs make my day so much better. I wish I was in my 20s again bc I think u and I would be amazing friends 💕 i don’t have many friends at all and it sucks so I can relate with u. Sending u lots of hugs 💕💕💕 and side note: All those jeans looked AMAZING on u 😍😍
9:00 Please, stay away from Twitter. Don't read into any drama there. Ask someone to moderate your comments. You need to focus on yourself. I think Ryland or your mother should mod your comments and filter out anything that could trigger you. It's very important that you focus on your mental health. <3 You are loved Morgan.
I had one of these days and I couldn’t stop crying
You should do a video of how you reached "enlightenment" && how you remember things from what you learned in elementary school It sounds really interesting I would love to watch !!!
You’re doing great, even if you don’t feel it. You are such a bright spirit, and even positive people have their down days. Don’t feel pressured to be anything less than honest. The very happiest of people are never always happy. Keep focusing on you, keep your head up, and know that so many people who don’t even know you, love you and support you 💕
❤️❤️❤️
it is harder to make friends, I struggle watching because Im in a similar boat, and I wish it was easier.
My life is about to change and it’s been v stressful. I’m almost 24 and I’m so close to finally leaving the nest as they say.
Morgan thank you for always being you. 💜
Morgan seeing you cry so painful, you’re such an amazing person you need to stop doubting yourself so much. You do put out amazing energy ❤️❤️
I'm so sorry you're going through this Morgan <3 ily! pack up and move to CO where you seemed so much happier:) California will always be there if you want to go back!
This is why I stay home ha ha No I'd knock that screaming baboon out just for you Morg
Anyone else not only identify with her to the 't' BUT is willing to take all her "unwanted items"?? Morgan, where exactly will you be leaving all those items?🤔🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣🤪🙃🤪🙃💜💕💜
Ewwww, f--k that mean spin class woman! What a horrid thing to say! I thought they were supposed to motivate people, not bring them down?! But like you said, everyone is walking around with their own issues, and that fitness class lady probably has some stuff going on, too.
From someone who also suffers from poor mental health.. In Jesus Christ, my souls finds fulfillment and true peace. This world is not my home because He saved my soul. Heaven is my home, I’m simply waiting for Him to call me out of this world. I pray that whoever is reading this will seek Him, He will meet you where you are. He will gladly accept you into His eternal Kingdom just as He did me. Romans 8:38 “neither death, not life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor death, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” In Him, you will find peace and fulfillment. He loves you, deeply. Accept Him into your life... it will be the best decision you ever make.
morgan seemed to always hide her struggles. i think in hopes of not wanting her youtube channel to be sad. i really enjoy morgan expressing her feelings. it really helps knowing that i’m not the only ones going through something similar. morgan has recently been getting so much hate for something that doesn’t involve her. such as the people she is with. which makes me so sad knowing that morgan is her own person and doesn’t need to be in that specific person’s shadow. morgan, never stop expressing your feelings. the worst thing you can do it bottle up your emotions. so many people, including me love you and your videos! ty for this morgan❤️
those DC white shoes would be fun to paint on ;)
I’m literally the same person lmfao
This did really help Morgan, I’ve been REALLY struggling with my mental health. I always burry the emotions because I still live with my family but I really do feel like I’m gonna fucking die for no reason. So much fun ;)
Morgan you should move back to Colorado and I’m saying that in the nicest way :)
Mooorgaan, I love you so much 🤍 it's comforting to see this side of your life, it's an important reminder that adding a camera and an audience does not equate to imminent betterness (spell check?) and it's an encompassing feeling to know you have these days, too. Wishing you love and happiness always 🤍✨
I feel the same way you do. It’s such a hard, confusing, lonely time in our lives (I’m 24) and I just want to thank you for being so open and honest about it! Though it sucks to hear that you are going through this, it’s comforting to know that I’m not alone. Thank you for being you and hopefully we both pull out of this soon and look back on it as a time of growth ❤️
❤️
I think the issue is that change will always happen in a lot of people have problems with change. But you have control over what happens in your life and it's okay to react in a way that helps you reflect the change. My best advice is give back and donate your energy to help others and you will receive what you're looking for.
Morgan!! Thank you so much for sharing this. Thank you so much for talking about your feelings, because everything you feel, is what I feel. It’s so lonely and you feel like you’re the only one going through this... so thank you for showing us what you are going through. I’m also very sorry that you feel this way. I hope your days get brighter 💕☀️
I want to give you a hug
Lmfaooooo the “everything’s fine. it’s fine” while simultaneously crying is very much a MOOD
I have breakdowns like that... Also I was feeling the DC shoes. LoL
God I'd be friends with you, you sound like an amazing and loving person. I wanna help you figure out this life, hell even im at this point but what really helps is having good supportive friends. Idc about your fame and whatever mild drama or drama that surrounds you i just wanna hang out with you as a normal human being because thats what we all are at the end of the day.  This world is so beautiful yet confusing and i hope one day you find more friends who arent afraid to be real and see you fall apart.  Id love to have that honor but hey im just some girl on the internet haha  So no hope but to whoever gets that privilege to help you through that darkest part of your life i hope they treat you well and help better yourself  Love you Morgan🖤🖤🖤
Morgaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan. I was literally crying while eating eggs while you were crying and eating eggs. It's ok, girl. Sometimes you just gotta cry while telling yourself you're ok.
9:07 this part i resonate so hard with. I  love you Morgan, you're doing your best and that's what matters,
Being bi polar I deal with a lot of bad days where I get absolutely nothing done.. Anxiety helps feed that.. Its a harsh cycle.  I'm lucky I found a gym I feel safe in, with the other members I have worked out with. I was taking kickboxing classes. I miss those people. My trainer is an amazing person, he's really helped me build more confidence in my athletic abilities, as few as they are 😂
Morgan. You don’t have to live in LA. Your happy with your family. Move back to them. Youtubers live all over the world.
She's making me cry 😭😭😭😭😭😭
the fact that they make you wear a mask when you do cardio is concerning
Moran, thank you for sharing this with us. Being honest like this really does show us that we aren't alone and it's okay to feel this way. I want you to know...you are very much not alone! You are doing your best and you're going to have bad days. When it comes to social media and comparing yourself, I think as someone with a following, sharing things like this video will eventually cause people to stop being fake on social media.
Mooorgaaaaan. I started crying because I feel the same and you have said everything I feel and oh my god, come live with meeee. I am alone with a dog and no social life and want friends but don't have any and like oh my goood I just want to give you a huuuug. 😭💙💙💙💙💙💙
Sounds like a spiritual awakening is calling you my friend. ♥️
I'm 4:55 minutes in and girl I already relate more then ever! You're not alone! And thank you for sharing your vulnerability because I have been feeling so alone with these emotions. You put it in such a good way to look at it. The universe is guiding but it's might take away a few things to get there. 😩 wait
it will get better morgan !! i feel you, we're all going through it right now <3 you're not alone, being in your 20s is simultaneously the most wonderful time and the most lonely time, especially in the pandemic. there's a light at the end of the tunnel!
Lol I just quit my job I have been hating the last 3 years to start a new one I like better and started going to the yoga I always wanted to try and I have switched up my break fast too, babe. It feels good. Maybe we are headed for a transformation collectively. Breaking away hurts though, but then it gets better.
I'm not alone squad
Morgan, thank you for sharing this video. I can truly understand and sympathise with what you're going through. I've been like this my all life and most of the time I feel like no one knows and understands how I feel and why I feel the way I am. I cried every time you started crying in the video because I feel your pain and emptiness. I wish to you, to everyone who feels this way and to myself to get better, to remind ourselves that we matter we are loved and that we need to talk about this, you're not on your own.
When I get my period ....
Girl LA is toxic for you :( sending hugs
Morgan I love you and I’m praying for you ❤️
I really needed this today Morgan. I've been trying to navigate and ignore feelings of depression for years and lately it has gotten worse. I like that you said, just because you have a bad day does not mean you will have a bad life. I needed that reminder! I made my first ever therapy appointment this morning too. Here's to being good to ourselves 💛
you don’t know how bad i want to move there for you 🥺 that might sound creepy but to be friends with you is EVERYTHING
I’ll hang out with you!!!
Unrelated, but this reminds me of the anguish I'd feel whenever I came home from a week of visiting family. It wasn't loneliness, as I'm not genuinely close enough to miss them, but like... just that feeling of coming back and seeing that the whole world has just continued on without me, unstopping and unaffected and I have to reinsert myself back in where I'm so obviously not needed. It feels so disconnecting/devaluing,  and incidentally validates all of that negative internal chatter that reminds us constantly of our worthlessness. You called yourself stupid twice in one minute, which makes me wonder how many times you've accidentally thought it in an entire day!
I moved out of my parents house, quit my job and then my parents moved out of state. I've been extremely emotional for the past 2 ish years. Change is hard, no matter how good or bad it is. We'll get through this ❤
Love you for this one morgan 😭💖 im also really going through it... I really wish i could have a friend like you in my life who understands...
Morgan we love you! ❤️ you look gorgeous btw. You’re doing amazing even if you don’t feel like it.
That's not a good trainer.. That's abusive bullshit
This is closely aligned to what my “breakthrough” went last week...and I honestly feel so much better knowing someone else is going through the same thing as me.
There is also of reasons many you tubers leave LA.. it’s okay love .. your mental health is more important
Glad you are showing the realness. Keep it coming sistah!
I needed this, thank you
Morgan i just wanted to say every time i watch your video it makes my day thank you
Make a poshmark Morgan!
sometimes i don't understand how someone can be this beautiful
is this me?  i felt this all too well, little things my love. find something an image, word, phrase to repeat or focus on until the "intrusive" thoughts or thoughts you know you don't want to think have gone or you've gotten on a better thought train.
Love you Morgan 💋❤💋❤ thank you for sharing, for being you, for bringing mental health and struggles into reality and letting the rest of us know we actually aren't the only person going through what we're going through. ❤💋❤💋
Maybe you could sell your clothes on Depop next time? 🥺👉🏼👈🏼
You seemed so happy in Colorado! Girl, do what's best for you and your mental state!
Omg. Relatable af
Morgan, you can have all the money. Friends and best job and still suffer from depression.  For no reason.  People that tell you to stop feeling that way, just doesn't understand depression. I get it..many people get it. Take only the good things.
Thank you for this
Morgan I love you!!! Also I need to know, where is this green sweatshirt from?? It looks bomb on you!!
I love you Morgan ♡♡♡♡ thank you for showing all sides of you. You are so beautiful inside and out. You are such an inspirational person keep going don't ever stop ♡♡♡♡♡
Just so you know, if I would live in LA we would soulcycle together at the back row.
Ur saying everything I'm feeling xxx
I have the same “not average” hoodie 🙃 hey its comfy as homewear 🤣
Where did Morgan’s roommate went? I remember she said someone gonna move in with her. 🥺🥺
I feel the exact same way! For me, I work in an oilfield, surrounded by men. The office isn’t for me, but I feel so out of place here. The people I work with are so sweet and supportive, but I always end up feeling not worthy or satisfied. But you have to work, you know? I feel that way when I’m home as well. I could definitely do better, and make all meals, and have a clean place. But, I have no energy or will to do anything. Maybe that’s my issue. But I definitely felt this video. It’s a little comforting knowing I’m not the only one feeling this way. I pray for healing for you, for me, and anyone else going through it
This is so relatable I-
I don’t feel good every single day I feel severely ill after having Covid a year ago. Never felt better.  I just haven’t been myself and I have really bad anxiety already and panic attacks and I’m just so much worse. I always feel like I’m going to die and it’s scary hugs. I’ve been crying all day then your video just popped up. I needed to know I’m not alone. I understand the being alone thing I’m lucky that I have my youngest son at home he’s 16 so I’m not alone  but I don’t know what I would do if I had to be alone.
I went through this 3 weeks ago for two weeks. I’m here for you.
Oh shit I just realized Ima be 19 soon😃
You have lots of money and no direction. Perhaps consider doing some charity work to ground yourself.
You're not a stupid person. how you feel hits very close to home and you have every right and reason to feel the way you do. We appreciate you morgan and thank you for sharing these parts of your life with us. I'm thankful that i'm not the only one going through these things, ilyssm <33 always
Thank you for this vlog. I've been feeling the same way for months.
1. Meditate to clear your mind and heart. 2. Tell yourself One Day at a Time, Moment by Moment - as often as necessary. 3. Go with the flow, and the flow will take you to your place. 4. RELAX. You got this... 💗💗💗💗💗
You are not alone. Know that.
Love you morgan! You'll get through it 💜
Girl, I promise you if you delete your facebook and instagram, you will become much happier. It is difficult for awhile, but before you know it you won't even think about it. If you stop comparing yourself to others, hopefully you can see what we see. How beautiful, amazing, and funny you are! I think you are an amazing influencer because you don't focus your life on having to have a relationship. You focus it on trying to love and find yourself. You are exactly what this world needs. Love you tons!
woah Morgan in that red dress!!!!
I clicked on this immediately as I was crying and having my own breakdown...and it helped so much
This breaks my heart, but you've shown time and time again how incredibly strong you are. You are so wise and have so much love to give. I wish I knew you in real life, I can relate to you so much. You're such a genuine soul, I wish nothing but the absolute best for you.
Matthew 28:11 says "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."  I know this might come off offensive to other people but it's something that helps me everyday because I know I can find rest in the Lord so I hope it can help you too :)
Morgan, thank you for being vulnerable. It definitely makes me feel like I’m not the odd one out and that it’s normal to feel this way.
Morgan watching you cry broke my heart. You are not alone. So many of the things you said were a mirror to the things I’ve similarly going through the past 2-3 years. I fucking promise it gets better. Remember that it’s okay to feel that you’re feeling. Let it come to you and let yourself feel it, and then let it go. You’re such a good person and you inspire so many and I know you’ll get through this. 💖
Morgan is working really hard, so props to her. Sending peace, light, happiness, and love!!
Just got a roommate bc I’m terrified of being alone too. I feel this 100 percent and I’m glad I’m not the only one 🥺
Girl you need a therapist you have major signs of depression
I actually teared up watching this, cause that's exactly how I feel. I really hope you find a way for yourself to get better. I really love your content and it feels like catching up with a friend. I wish you all the best, all will be well(I keep telling myself XD)!
Unrelated to your video but I just want to say that you look absolutely banging right now, your skin, hair and body looks so good, keep pushing on you’ve got this Morgan 💖
I relate to Morgan so much it’s unreal 😭
Wow felt that 😢😭
People weren't mentally meant to know about millions of people. Think about how many people you would actually know about if it wasn't for today's technologies. Morgan expressing pressures of comparing herself to others is totally valid. And hearing thousand of people's opinions and criticisms about her life is a lot too.
I would SO be your friend!! You are amazing and worth it keep pushing!!
Man, watching this really made me sad. I've felt the same way mentally and just never really allowed myself to act on it. I felt like I shouldn't feel that way so I didn't let myself feel it.  You do put good energy into the world. Your videos definitely brighten my day. Just because you're relatable to me. I have a lot of the same struggles. You've got this.
praying for you!! sending better days and positive thoughts your way!!
Morgan - you’re wonderful and brave and this video was so vulnerable. Thanks for sharing.
💖 love you Morgan 💖 maybe it’s the fact that your being alone. 🥺
thank you Morgan so fucking much for this. i loved the rawness, and it made me feel less alone in my struggles. you're a queen honestly
Morgan you are doing the best thing you can do!! You said it, you are not isolating you're self, you are doing it!! You will figure it out, don't give up on your self! You already feel better and if ever this pit feeling comes back just remember there are better days around the corner. When you feel sad because you think you haven't achieved enough just look at yourself from the past (like you just said) and see that you are doing better! You got this girl, and you are not alone <3 I'm sure more people have gone through the same situation (I know I have)
It honestly felt longer than 2 weeks since we've seen you, but I don't care at all. You can take all the time you need to take care of yourself, I'll still watch whatever you come out with whenever that may be.  On a lighter note, I totally feel you on those birds lol. Reminds me of when I used to walk to my bus stop for school in the mornings years ago. I would always get nervous to walk passed them as the birds lined up on the powerlines. Because birds do not like me. Like I remember going into a pet shop and all of the little birds freaked out so bad when I went over to them. I walk away, they go quiet, I go back, they get loud. If someone else went over they were fine. Rude lol. Hope that story made you or anyone else feel better!
love you Morgan <3 we're always here for yooou!!!!!!!
Aww honey, you need to live with someone. That's all. Lots of us need that 🥰💕
Are you okay :(
Just wanna send you some cuddles from Scotland. ❤️
R E L A T A B L E! Love you girlie! Keep fighting the self growth fight! 🌳
You're a beautiful extraordinary young lady Morgan 💜. You need to leave the LA toxic vibes as soon as you can.
I feel you on the friends part. My only friend lives like 5 miles down the road from me but I still hardly see her, and it's so hard to find new friends because trust issues 😩
You’re more than amazing just the way you are Morgan 🖤
Not me also having a cat named Cookie and also buying a not average shirt from forever 21
100% relatable. When y we’re taking in ur red dress I was like damn she really just said what I was feeling
Really appreciate your openness ❤️
thank you from the bottom of my heart for being so raw. i can relate to you on so many things that you’ve said. thank you, thank you, thank you. ❤️🥺 you’re going such an amazing job maintaining what you’re going thru ❤️
You are so gorgeous inside and out! Just remember this is a moment in your life, not your whole life story. I think it is amazing how you love others. Please don't let other people's actions change that.
You’re definitely not alone
I’m in a similar place at the moment and I’ve been NEEDING to go through my stuff; o think you’ve inspired me to actually do it??
You look so pretty in that dress! I love your outfit!😍
Do you feel this way when you’re in Colorado? If you don’t, then you should definitely consider moving back there permanently. You’re clearly happier in Colorado with your family and some of your friends. California just might not be the right fit anymore.
In the same boat Morgan! Still figuring it out!
I love you! Hope everything gets better for you ❤️
This hits home! I love you
Sweet bean ❤️! Ah, bless you for showing us this side of you. I wish I could be a friend to you and give you more support in person. Just know, your feelings are perfectly valid. I know it’s not easy to stop feeling guilty. It’s not your fault that you feel so low. You’re doing so good in working through your dark times. I love you so dearly! I hope these bad moments don’t linger for too long
love your vlogs ❤️ also, your sunglasses/glasses collection is fire 🔥🔥🔥 and you pull them ALL off 😎
That soul cycle lady sounds soulless
move back home!!!! You NEED to be there!!! La is not for you and that’s okay. You were so happy back home, you belong there
Loved seeing you rid yourself of the plant ☺️ lol love you dude
MORGAN I so needed to see this video. Thank you! I am 100000% going through the EXACT same things you are. You are not alone & also let’s be friends. I live in the South Bay by the beach, let’s go roller blading and fall all over the place
Oh Morgan...seeing you upset is 💔 You are more loved than you know! I pray you find peace in this crazy world. You deserve far more happiness than you think you do ❤✌🏻
Someone on Instagram shared that "Emotions we do not process are emotions we feel". I feel that 🖤
U look fucking gorgeous goddamn
Does she talk about what happened to her nails here ?
I cried with you 😫😓😥😭I love you so much Morgan,  you are so genuine and keep it real. Thanks for showing us the real you....your ups and downs because we all go through it. Keep your head above the water. Remember that after the storm comes the rainbow. We love you, you are never alone💕❤💓
HUGS!! It will all make sense one day, I promise you. Just keep holding on, and being true to yourself, whatever it may be!
This made me feel more normal. Thank you Morgan, you’re a fantastic person. Love you the mostest ❤️
I have been there so hard! I love you so much for sharing your journey like this. I wish when I was your age and going through this I had a better outlet.
Honey,  I so want to give you a hug.  I completely understand how you feel.  Been there.  Am there.  Wallow in it on occasion.  Find something every day that gives you joy ... just one little thing.  Much love.
Meee🤍
16:21 literally same. Surprised I’m even watching this video tbh
this may be my favorite vlog yet???
Sis, I had a day like this in the last week, too. Was mercury in retrograde or what? I’ve been alone alone for the past year, and it is so hard and sometimes it just gets on top of you. I absolutely understand this.
Dude I wanna give you the biggest hug ever. No joke I feel like if we knew each other irl we would be best friends. I literally feel all those things you were describing you feel. It sucks. You're an amazing person amd you are not stupid.
Anytime I see you break down,  my heart breaks for you. Sending you love.
dont worry, i am lonely as hell and have no friends... i mean, i can count them on one hand and still have at least 3 figures free. The ones i do have, i do not see as they live miles and miles away.. I am alone at home most of the 99% of the time. Your vids help me get though shit. xx
Dude I needed this so much 🥺 I’ve been going through it too. You are amazing! Ily 💕
This is me. I’m watching me. I wish I could give you a hug. You are such an amazing person. I give you so much respect to be still going to school. Please keep going. Education is one thing that no one can take away from you. I love how genuine and raw you are. Social media really sucks ass. But also like I’m living a cycle every single day doing the same thing and I think this whole pandemic situation is making what I already felt so much worse. But I’m also so blessed and I love my children. I’m all over the place. I’m like pretty sure I have ADD. I’m just trying to figure it out...
Morgan, you are not alone. I’ve been battling bipolar depression for years and the past two years have been the most challenging years of my life but I just tell myself to take one day at a time. Thank you for sharing this and showing me that I’m not alone either.
Morgan! As someone who had a complete meltdown this morning for something similar you are seen and you made me feel seen ❤️ much love
You clearly have a bad association with LA girl. Just get out of there. Go back home or try some place new! The universe is telling you that LA isn’t the place for you and that’s ok! We are all rooting for you 💕✨
We all have bad days Morgan sometimes we take a week or more to recover and move forward and sometimes we snap back quite quickly, I don't mind if you don't upload religiously. When you do upload im clicking alllll those ads before I watch the video girl 🥰😍😘🤑 We got you because I know you got us! xxx
Girlllll you’re like one of the only channels I go onto YouTube to watch. You’re so strong! You got this! Love you Morgan 💓
Thanks for posting this, Morgan. Life’s been extremely hard recently and you being so transparent with us is showing me I’m not alone. Keep your head up, queen, we’ll make it through this❤️💐
Morgan I have such a hard time making new friends too. Ily and anyone who’s lucky enough to be your friend is blessed by your presence 😘💕✨
Morgannnn move out of LA. Really seems like you thrive with family
I am just wondering, have you found a great therapist or psychologist? I feel like you are so honest with your mental health and I wish you all the best and help. You are not stupid you are SO emotionally smart and empathetic and literally all of us would love to be your friend and see you thrive!
Just go back home, be happy. You have a fan base that will support you now doing anything. But being alone in LA is not it sis
❤️
She’s talking about garrett and andrew.
I would move if I were you, you are free to do so you don't have anything holding you to any location as of right now. A new start might be what you are longing for. I feel like you are where I was a few years ago. I moved and took control of the things I could "fix or change". Then went through a year of therapy to work on accepting the things I couldn't change.. I also am happier when surrounded by people I love and that support me. I'll be praying for you and your journey 💜
Welcome to depression, and anxiety this is what I go through everyday, I hide it well and act happy and inside I am crying and breaking down and no motivation.
Honestly Morgan,  I felt that way this time last week where I just broke down crying and bawling my eyes out to my boss. One minute I was fine at work then the next my body and mind was like "nope stop. Your stressed. You need to stop and talk to someone about it." Most people just need to listen to their subconscious more often and realize that its okay to take a step back to enjoy life and build a new path. We all know that things are gonna be drastically different cause of last year. We just need to take a step back and focus on ourselves and not on others. My job is giving me less hours which is a plus.
Love u Morgan I needa watch this as soon as I finish work❤️ it's my first day back after 77 days of medical leave and it's been a month since I had my surgery. I hope you're doing okay though 🙂.
Get to know Jesus Christ in him you will find fulfillment. Start by reading the Bible. Your Amazing!
I think that it is thee kinds of videos that we need more of, from every influencer! I think it helps a lot of people feel better just to see a more personal side of you, that they can relate to. im proud of you, morgan!
We all feel you
Morgan, I'm really sorry about what you're going through. But sharing this video has really made a lot of us feel like we're not alone and I'm so thankful to you for that.
Not me clicking on this while crying in the middle of a breakdown and Morgan’s giving us advice 4 minutes in😭🥺💕
wish you had a depop girl I’d buy it AAAaaaaaLLLLL
Morgan, I love you so much. I think we all appreciate you uploading this and sharing this with us. you're always so relatable and it means so much that someone with a following like yours is as real as you are. sending you lots of love!!! <3 btw u look so good w that red dress OMG
Morgan! I'm barely two minutes in but bestie FIND A CYCLEBAR NEAR YOU! It's cycling but not culty like soul cycle. They don't yell at you or make you feel bad about yourself. One of their biggest things is it's your ride so you do whatever you're comfortable doing while still challenging yourself. I've seriously fallen in love with it. It's such a positive and encouraging environment. <3
I like you because you’re actually relatable :)
I think you said you don't like hugs, but they really do help when you are feeling miserable. Especially from our moms. Love you Morgan, you're beautiful!
Thank you so much for being real
Thank u so so so much for staying authentic and not hiding this. Your struggle is real and it's hard work but ur showing us all how ur getting through it, little by little. I am cheering u on from over here in bloody Amsterdam. Never met u, but I am jumping and shouting, keep going 💖🫂
I'd *sell my soul* for a morgan adams and tana series.
I'm having a really bad month.
Morgan! You are not stupid. You’re human. And we all just have to take things day by day. Your videos always make me laugh but I love seeing something that’s so real And that I can relate to. You’re gonna get through this.
Girl I have been exactly where u r and I know how u feel. It breaks my heart because I know what ur feeling and it's absolutely horrible. When I went through this I literally would cry when certain memories popped into my head,lyrics in songs I heard or just randomly day to night. U seem allot like me too, where u dwell on things, idk maybe I'm wrong. But just know it gets better! One day u will wake up and all of that heartache will disappear. I hope u feel better. And if ur happier back home maybe u should consider moving back? Because ur well being and happiness is more important than anything. I'm sending prayers ur way ❤️
Random question. Are you living in the area where skid row is? I’ve been watching a lot documentaries on that area. A lot of people have move out of Los Angels because of it.
I just want to give you a hug!! Everything will be okay!
I'm so thankful you're SO beautiful but still real about life. I love you cuz I feel like we're the exact same & I know that's how all of your subs feel. I guess we're all bottom feeders together 🤎
You need a roommate.  Your better in the company of others.  Maybe you need to move out of Cali. I don't think Colorado is the answer though.  You need a complete change.
Seems to be a correlation to being happy near family, I hope you consider moving near your family! Some people are ultra independent and enjoy not being near family, but others (like myself) function better with a support system around 😊
It's refreshing to see such honest content - thankyou 💖
I love your videos so much and I love how real you are with everyone, you’re such a genuine and sweet person and you’d be such a blessing to have as a friend. I resonate with you more than I think I’ve ever resonated with any person on social media. You deserve so much in life and I know great things are coming your way, not only for you but your family as well.
I can totally relate to you! thank you so much for sharing your experience... My advice, if you need one, is try to go to therapy and find a good psychiatrist, I struggled to find the right medicine and therapy for me until I found it and now my depression and anxiety are in check!... I'm glad you are in a better head space and remember that doesn't matter where you are or who you are with the light comes from within! love you morgan
Girl, go home.. its okay to not be okay. I need my mom, even if you don't live in her house. Having her down the road is crucial to my happiness, that's just who we're.. go be with your family
Dude yes! My depression has been so bad lately and I haven’t been admitting it at all. Part of me didn’t want to say it out loud, and another part of me didn’t want to admit that my depression is bad again.
Self awareness is half the battle, thanks for uploading I needed my dose of morgaaaan
Morgan, you’re not alone. I really felt this, I’ve also had a bad week with a lot of heavy shit weighing on my mind and I haven’t been feeling myself at all. Before I clicked on your video I booked my first appt with a therapist on Talkspace after talking to a friend who referred me. Thank you for sharing this, I really needed it💜 another sign of the universe✨🌎
I don’t think Morgan should go back to that soul cycle class...
Morgan, I’ve been feeling like this since the beginning of the year, thank you for letting us see this side of you. I love you I wish you and I could be friends in person. Xoxo
you are not stupid, but I feel that, I say this to myself way too often as well.
Praying for you to get though this depression girl, your so funny & so beautiful you always make my day when you post!! Love youu 💕
Gurl...same everything same. Love you sending you good vibes💕
Stop trying to feel fulfilled, start feeling alive. You are exactly where you need to be right now, when you’re strong enough you’ll look back and realise that you need to go through it to get to the goal point. ❤️
Hope you’re feeling better bc ik the struggle rn and it sucks so much but you’re loved too and your fans support your mental growth and healing ♡
Babe I know you said you were okay, but damn, are you really? I think you maybe need a roommate or idk but I hate seeing you so sad when you are alone :(
Whoa whoa whoa. MORGAN. You look _so_ pretty through this whole video. Like... fucking stunning.  I'm sorry you're going through such a rough time. I was really hoping coming back to LA would be okay for you, but maybe going back to Colorado would be best. You can always come back to LA to see Ryland and whoever else.... your mental health is so important. You've given LA time... it just might not be for you.
I love watching Morgan because she doesn't hide what she's going through which is the place I'm trying to get to. Thank you Morgan for doing what you do.
Thank you for showing something so real that so many people deal with everyday. I am one of them and seeing this made me have hope. Stay strong morgs we got this 🦋
i wish i could have some of morgans clothes😭😭
WHY DO PEOPLE THINK EVERYONE'S AN EXTROVERT! I'm like 2 min into the video and I feel SO SORRY for your experience in the cycling class, I can't handle speaking to strangers either, and I can be very social it is just that you can't do that with anyone! It's a freaking clycling class! You just want to bust your ass while fighting your own issues in your head! don't ask me to talk, less yell to strangers! For Jesus sake!  Love you Morgan
So relatable. You got this girl!
I love you Morgan I know we don't know each other personally I wish we did we would be best of friends I wish we were friends so I could be there for you on days like this it will get better like you said just wait a few days I'm so sorry you're going through whatever it is you're going through we all love you and can't wait to see what you post next
I just wanna say you're a beautiful person and i love you
I would 100% file a complaint with whoever runs the gym or whatever that SoulCycle class was. That's highly inappropriate.
Morgan, thank you for posting this. I know it was probably hard or you didn’t want to but honestly I need this. It’s so crazy I am not alone in this. EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING you said in the video is exactly what I’m going through. It’s so sad and it sucks so so bad. I hate change so much & feel so lonely even when I’m around people. At nights is even worse... I know there will be a light at the end of the tunnel. I hope you feel better!
you need a chakra realignment..
Ok sis... I’m not sure how many times you are going to say it before it clicks... LA ain’t for you sis! Go back and live near tour family and friends
Giving everything away gives me LIFE  Going to goodwill and getting rid of all my clutter of stuff that is actually still nice stuff. Its just a great feeling unloading
Im so proud of you for making this video. It must've been so hard. I relate, all I do is work and my relationships just aren't the same anymore. I struggle feeling like I'm not coping and I am not as driven as I should be. I stress myself out so bad that I literally get sick. Ehh. I don't think we can ever live up to our own standards and expectations. Stay strong beautiful!
I am so glad you created this channel and that you feel safe with us! WE LOVE YOU 🥰
I think people have the tendency to throw the word love around too much. I love my car, my house, this sweater, these shoes, etc. You get the idea. Love isn't that easy, especially when it comes to loving ourselves. So, where I don't know you to love you, I really like you. You're funny, smart, beautiful, open and honest, and I think being your friend would be a blast. However, I'm an old woman, but I see a young me in you and I don't want you to become an old me. I look back and see all the decades I've wasted beating myself up by trying to live up to what I deemed was the perfect person in every way we think exudes perfection. Which is elusive at best. Just try liking yourself first. The love will follow. Which is the natural course of events.  You're not alone. You have a lot to offer as a human being. Don't let life slip by you to only one day look back a feel the regrets, the emptiness, the loneliness we imagined and the self imposed prison we can create for ourselves.  My favorite line from one of my favorite old movies,  "Life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death. Live, live, live!" 😷🙂⚘🥂😎
Morgan seeing you cry made me wanna cry, you’re definitely not alone. Thank you for sharing this vulnerable side with us, have you maybe thought about a roommate or moving back to colorado to be closer to your family?? Living alone can be overwhelming especially when you have anxiety and a lot of the people you know live somewhere else. Colorado sounds like it might be the good choice to go with at this point in your life and that’s 100% okay! Also all those jeans you tried on looked so good on you! ❤️❤️ sending love 🌱💚
Omg I feel so bad when you cry 😢😢😢💖💖💖
I USED TO FEEL EXACTLY LIKE THIS WHEN I MOVED AWAY FROM HOME
Sending you love<3
Anyone else want to invite Morgan into their homes and be her BFF? Morgan, let’s be friends. Come over and hang out 😘😄
As a fellow 23-year-old-still-in-college-wondering-what-I’m-doing-with-my-life person, I feel this and I am right there with you girl
holy fuck are we all just living the same life? you are NOT alone. All of us in our 20's are just going through it. Quarantine and this pandemic has brought out the worst in our mental health but also the best in our efforts to work on our mental health
Morgan I feel the same way, I’m sure a lot of people have been feeling the struggle during the midst of all that is going on! You’re not alone, and it’s ok to not be feeling your best right now ❤️❤️❤️
holy shit. you have no idea how much it helps me to hear you say this. we will be ok. we gotta
Do u have Poshmark
I just want to hug u...but it's OK to not be OK, You are a beautiful person inside and out.
Thank you for sharing this video 💖 🙏🏼💪🏼
I like your nails
Makes me sad seeing you cry. . You are so beautiful and funny and wonderful and I enjoy you so so much
This year has already been so bad for me and I’m like wtf what do I do and everything seems like it’s  falling apart
Morgan, you’re awesome and helping so many people by sharing some of your internal struggles. We usually only see the best of the best that people want the world to see. If you look to the world for happiness you’ll be let down every time. It’s a relationship with with our creator and Savior that gives fulfillment and a peace that only He can give. Hope you have a great day... You are enough!
Not me crying in public while watching this because I can relate so much 🙃
Morgan I love watching your videos. Your feelings are genuine and true. That's amazing you can be that and also funny and like a friend I wish I had! Hope you are feeling better. You're awesome!
Baby go back home ("Colorado" in spanish means red or reddish)  build your life your way, you'll always be grateful with the hard decisions made for yourself. Give your best to your future, you ave earned it. ✨🙏🌎
“12 intelligence points smarter” hahaha
she is the only leo i ever knew of to be sad when alone. also morgan you make to much money not to be happy idk if you need to move back home or something cuz baby your to pretty to be so sad.
Thank you for being an raw and real about how you’re feeling. I think you’re really voicing how many of us are feeling including me. I have been having quite a bit of breakdowns throughout this year alone. But from that we’re constantly growing and learning which is so valuable. Anyways.. love u girlie. Keep on thriving ✨
YOU ARE NOT ALONE in your feelings💜
I totally get what you are going through. When I was at my healthiest. I hit my weight loss goal. I felt completely empty, loSt and depressed. I thought i would be happy but in honesty...I completely lost myself and forgot who i was.
“Should I get these tiki torches to feel something” is literally me. It has been so hard for me not being able to be who I want to be just because I feel nothing. I believe in you Morgan ❤️❤️❤️
Honey, life will get better and it will all work out. I promise. I had a some bad years (from 18 to 28) and believe me when I say it was BAD but somehow it all worked out.  This past year have been crazy for everyone, everywhere. Let yourself feel down for a while, take care of yourself. And remember; if everyday was a good day we wouldn't and couldn't appritiate it as we all do. A bad day/mounth/year/s is NOT a bad life. Its just a bad part of your awesome life. So keep it up❤
Thank you for being open and honest with your mental health. I am sending so many positive thoughts and vibes your way
Morgan Adams,the realist and my favorite bitch in the entire world I literally love you Morgan ❤️❤️❤️
I felt this in my soul! Im happy for you that you are working so hard to try and feel your best. Its so easy to just turn the lights off and hibernate for weeks on end. You are being proactive and thats awesome! I know how freaking hard just taking a shower can be
I needed this today thank you Morgan :)
Morgan you are good, smart and beautiful. I'm so sorry you're having a tough time now, but it will get better. You will find ways to heal, and to feel better. It takes time. You're very brave and strong to share all of this with the internet. Sending you love from across the world, from Serbia.
SCHOOL LITERALLY RUINS MY MENTAL HEALTH
Over Thinking could be our downfall ! Search here on YouTube 👉🏻Eckhart Tolle ✨ reading his books help me so much that I am a hole new person . He has a Chanel here ✨🥰🙏🏻
🪞Mirror, mirror on the wall....  Who is the strongest “she boss” of then all?        Morgan is; duhhh🪞  you are my spirit animal and I need you as my new sidekick; bestieee.:.:.seriously in the market hmu lol I’m in Westlake let’s grab a caffeine-like beverage 👏🏼👯‍♀️☕️ currently having a breakdown breakthrough of my own. You are a good person don’t let people suck you dry girl. They will. Shitty people will use you as a power supply. Don’t let somebody else use you and feed off your greatness!!!! Ps. Post baby body I could use some donations lol jusssyin. 😋
Covid doesn't help at all as well Morgan, you're amazing and you're loved by a lot of people, but most importantly you need to love yourself and be okay with yourself. I hope you find yourself soon, sending love❤❤❤❤
I love Morgan so much, she is so relatable and honest. So glad she shows us the good AND the bad parts of her story unlike the creators who filter everything in their lives. Hope you feel better soon Morgan ❤️
"I'm afraid for the sun to set, because I know that that's when you really feel everything."  -Morgan 2021
Thank you for posting this vlog because I'm also going through the same type of thing :((( its nice to know you aren't alone in the world
Morgan, thank you for this video. I relate so much and it’s so nice to “connect” with someone you can relate to so much!
Thank you for being so open Morgan, I know this makes others feel not so alone especially in the times we are right now. We will always support youuuu!❤️❤️❤️❤️
not trying to overstep but you should def talk to a psychiatrist and a psychotherapist, I think that’d really help to talk to some experts 💖 I was feeling so much of the same shit and I tried all the alternative methods and not taking meds and it wasn’t for me. the best thing I can recommend is talking to those people. you seem so genuine and don’t deserve to feel like this!!
i have already commented but i still feel sad after seeing u so sad. love u
The drastic change of your mindset once you got back to CA is a good indicator that you need to get out of there D:
That was so raw and real, good god. I'm glad that you shared this. Thank you. It's a real insight into depression and how even when everything is going 'right' on paper, you can still be sad. Just gotta wait it out until those happy chemicals rebalance themselves.
I'm in my mid 40's and dealing with this also!! Be grateful for the good/uneventful days!
Some things I tell myself when I'm not doin well are I've gotten through it before and I've had those times where my mind is "at peace" so I believe I can get there again and only move forward. Also in the end everything will be ok, if it's not ok it's not the end. <3
Hi 🙋🏼‍♀️ I live in Colorado! We can be friends! I am an introvert, homebody, and have social anxiety so going out and doing things doesn’t happen very often for me. I too deal with depression and anxiety and feeling overwhelmed so we would be on the same level there. I have no problem laying on the couch, playing animal crossing, and not do a damn thing. I think we’d get along well. 😅 So move back to Colorado, catch your breath, and let’s have a margarita and movie night. 🥰
You are NOT a bottom feeder. You are a queen and a legend. Thank you for sharing your lows. Your vulnerability is inspiring. You are definitely on the cusp of some kind of transformation that will be so exciting and awesome, but also yeah so fricking painful. But you are amazing, so just stay in it!
There's so much that I wish I could say but I don't want to presume to tell you what to do or that I know your life. I wish you all the best and that you can find a place to be surrounded by people who are supportive.
This too shall pass. Bad times come and go. Life is just ebb and flow.
If you move to WV you can live with me, i got a spare room and cats that cookie could play with. 💕
hope you are feeling better, im sorry for what you are feeling and going through. It is very hard. love u
Morgan I think you should move back to Colorado ... I feel like Ryland and Shane are making you feel as if you need to stay in LA but you are sooo much happier at Colorado
Omg thank you for showing this side of you and being super honest with us ❤️ you definitely should move to Colorado bc it looks like you are worse mentally in Cali 😭
finally someone talks bout these moods ! at least i am not the only one, makes me feel better lol. we all get there at a random time and it sucks.
It's ok to be just you. 😗
I had a really bad week too... Money is really tight and I've been fighting depression for as long as I can remember at this point... You are not alone. I have no friends whatsoever so I'm well versed in feeling lonely. You are not alone 🖤🖤🖤
Girl. Buy a small fixer up in CO. You can redo it with your family and thrive. Cause the redoing your room videos you were glowing and happy. There's nothing wrong with being a YouTuber not in LA. Doesn't make you a failure just means LA wasn't your vibe.
we’re cancelling the instructor who calls people bottom feeders.   Love,  A fellow back row bitch
ily morgan thank you for this I feel like this so much and glad i’m not alone 💓 you’re amazing i hope you know that
Thanks morgan ...  Your end story is exactly how i feel ..  we got this 💗
I love you Morgan....I feel you so much. *hugs* You are prefect as you are.
This has been me for the past two weeks and people in my life are starting to notice and it sucks, I never wanted to drag them into it. So I'm committing to changing after seeing this video. We can do it together!
Is everyone feeling like this too? I’m still doing what I’m supposed to everyday but I’m still like sad and blah 😕
As I'm having a mental breakdown I see this video pop up.
morgan im not kidding when i say that it was like watching a video of myself from the past two weeks. i am currently at home burt out and not working, having a midlife crises cuz i dont know what i want/can do with my life (not even gonna start about how we are the same body type and when you said you were gonna try on all your jeans i was holding my heart for you cuz girl that is the fastest way to make yourself feel shitty). Seeing this video made me feel not alone and i so wished we met in person because hearing you say its hard to make friends made me so sad (cuz, me too bish), but also you seem like such a sweet and caring person and i know for sure that if we met we would be friends. so pls morgan, know you have a friend in the Netherlands, keep being you and thank you.
🖤🖤🖤 I wish I could hug you 🖤🖤🖤 - greetings from Czech Republic
Morgan thank you for sharing this video and being so open; it’s really helpful to know I’m not alone in the bad weeks! We love you!!💓
I’m so sorry Morgan! It’s so hard to be in such a transitional age, I’m ready to be thirty and know what’s going on already. Maybe you’re just someone who thrives living with other people?
Oh so we are all the same person. I see.
I’m shook for the truth or drink but love that you managed to work through all of your thoughts as rationally as you did, it was honestly beautiful to see and as long as you continue to do that I know you’ll eventually find true happiness 💖💖💖💖💖
Maybe LA isn't for you. Just remember we watch you for you not for LA.
I hope each day gets better and better for u. U r such a sweet, funny person, loving person u deserve the best. U seemed so much happier in Colorado and I could tell ur family was so excited to have there again. Try to focus on the positive and the negetive people just need to be cut out. I did that about four years ago and Im so happy since I did that and the stress they gave me is gone. Its hard to let go but sometimes it is so necessary. Sending u hugs.
i can relate to this so much.  I've lived by myself for a few years and i've definitely gone through periods of time where i felt so lonely and then i'd spend a weekend or whatever with my family and feel so happy and then as soon as i had to go back to my lonely apartment i would just fall apart. I would get hit with this wave of depression. And i really only had one friend who i barely saw.  I was stuck in this cycle for a long time. It's hard, and it gets lonely, but you''ll figure it out.  Hang in there :)
Omg when you said nothing in your life is the same, that rippled through my soul..
O.M.G. S.A.M.E.! I nodded to everything you were saying. This makes me feel less alone, so thank you, Morgan! I think you're a great person, so funny and genuine. And I think it's so admirable that you started going to school again during this pandemic. I hope you (and we all actually) get better soon <3
Morgan you are amazing and your vlogs are amazing as well. You look beautiful smiling and and making us smile. You inspire me to have a positive attitude. you are gorgeous girl!!!!!love you so much 😘
Dear Morgan ! This moment in the world is so chaotic ! And social platforms don’t help ! Like u say Everything is going to get better ✨🙏🏻 Live now ✨day by day (that helps A lot ) and don’t try to pleased anyone  Cheer up beautiful ! We love you ♥️🌷😘
You're NOT alone 💛  This too shall pass
Every video you put out, I swear to fuck, it's like looking in a mirror ;~; I wish I had someone like you who understood what I felt. Fuuuuuck. :/
Morgan honey you just need to get LAID 😜😉😂😎
God I felt this video on a whole other level! This is me.
You need routine.
You are so so so so so so so pretty! It hurts my heart that you don't see how pretty you are! But I do feel you, I have everything; a family, a Great job, I have the highest salery of all my friends, the biggest  house, I Just got my Dream car. I have been on a health journey for 8 months and it shows( stil got a looooong way to go, about 20kg) and I do feel good about the way I look and I am 40 so it is about time. . But my mentalhealth has gone downhill so fast. And I feel so bad because I have nothing to feel Sad about, but I still do.
Morgan I love you but I think the Internet is a very bad place for you and your mental health. You’re over looking all the big things and focusing on the bad
Morgan I understand you, we are living hard times. If you feel that everything you are doing doesnt help go to a psychologist. It will help you yo talk with one. Dont take it in a bad way. Hope you get better, you deserve to feel happy and good
I love you Morgan!!!💖
Honey I understand, I'm going through it right now. My dad passed away 11 days ago and I'm incredibly sad and anxious. I know this too shall pass but it's so painful. I hope things get better for you. We're here for you!❤
I would love to be your friend! Omg. But I definitely get it.
I have been feeling the same way so thank you for this
So proud of you for getting through all you're going through! Thank you for sharing your experience. So many of us relate to what you're going through and you help us all through. Thank you for being you <3
Morgan you look good in jeans 😍
Bitch I just relate so much to the mental struggle omg we are not alone and we need therapy asap
Morgan, you are such a good person. I think everyone knows this feeling(s), and hearing someone so nurturing like you actually say those feelings out loud makes us feel known . I turn 30 in two weeks, and I do mourn over those memories I had years ago, sometimes even over memories that happened just a week ago. I personally am happy with my life right now, but sometimes I do feel like I crave more. Sometimes, I make those "more" things happen, other times, I just let the idea of that something slip away. It will pass, especially because you are aware of those feelings. You can get through this! I know I'm just a random person, but I seriously love you. It's okay not to be happy every minute of the day! We're all here supporting you <3
Hey love, it feels like you need a new place ASAP. Maybe this apartment has a bad juju
MORGAN!! I missed you!!
Is this hard for moms to watch? I just always want my kids and other moms kids to feel happy!!
I really just want to give you a big hug ❤️ Thank you for speaking out about your mental health, It really does make a difference to know other people feel the same way xx
What happen to you bff, hope you feel better! Life change and everything is not forever, I am glad you posted this ..🥰 hugd
Love you Morgan! Thanks so much for being so honest, I’m sure this video really healed a lot of people, including me. You are amazing and we all support you! ❤️
Get out of the toxic area, wear what you love and be happy! You are gorgeous in anything you wear! I love your silly personality on your videos, I hope that's how you are in real life. 😘
Me too. I'm at this stage in life.
Morgan, get some succulents for your balcony. I can recommend a few. Let me help :)
NEVER call yourself crazy Morgan. We promote mental health here always. No one is crazy
Ah honey, if you only realised how much your good energy you put out makes a difference to so many people! You are a good person, you are an amazing soul! Wishing you all good vibes and well wishes ❤ Also, there's a lot of things you removed from your wardrobe I totally would wear 🤣 All the best to you 😊
Ok relatable content
What you're expressing sounds a lot like depression. And getting up and doing things you think you "need" to do is only putting a bandaid over the depression and not letting it heal. If you haven't already, please see a therapist. Hope thins get better.
Maybe you need more structure? Like... living with your fam or friends - they have their things that they need to do and have a structure to their lives - maybe a “normal” job would be better for you? Idk man - I am just thinking out loud here lol
Dear Morgan, I completely understand comparing yourself to those other gals. I'd just like to point out a lot of those girls get a lot of heat on the internet, mentioned pretty frequently on drama channels. Even when you do get mentioned on other channels, drama or not, people always talk about how much they like you. I just want to show you that you being you is more than enough. People love who you are. And those other girls that would be classified as "a dime a dozen", people are always finding things wrong with them. I hope this gives you some insight into how we all feel about you. 😊
You are such a wonderful, genuine person. This will pass. I’ve been where you are. I was living in Chicago and had to decide whether to stay or go home to Michigan. It was so stressful. I ended up going back to Michigan which worked out but I always wondered what would’ve happened if I’d stayed in Chicago. 💗
I feel like everyone is going through it right now... its nice to see that im not alone
Morgan I rarely comment on yt but I want you to know you are so special and anybody would be lucky to have you as a friend💜 stay strong and the right people will come into your life when the time is right
youve rly grown on me morgan thanks for being honest with us, it feels 'good' to know i'm not alone in this state of mind/being.
Thank you for your honesty. Sweetheart, you obviously have depressions. And it is ok....if you can afford it, stay in bed, watch a movie, don´t care about the world. It will go away. And: change the apartment! It does not become you well. Love you!
i keep having to pause , the parallels we have, and are currently tolerating, are too close to home.  idk what else to say with this comment bt damn morgen shit is WEIRD
I would love to start a discord community with everyone here to help each other out. Any thoughts?
Trying to re-build your old life because you miss it and struggling is me right now :( I'm 25. Hugs, Morgan <3 you're not alone
Hey Morgan look up emotional wheel it will help to pin point how you feel. It’s not nice to be made to feel persecuted by your natural personality. I have been to CrossFit and everyone shouts and it make me uncomfortable to force shouting at someone. She sounds like a cow I would make a complaint about that woman she can’t call her client selfish she is really hurting you saying that. Saying your a bottom feeder is saying you don’t matter if you can’t confidently shout and stuff. Trying to humiliate people during an exercise class is uninspiring for anyone. She needs to be told it’s not right to call you that though.. do make a complaint I think you should anyway xx
Morgan, move back to Colorado. Just because you like something doesn't mean it's what's right for you. L.A. was a fun part of your journey, but it doesn't mean it's the final destination for you and that's okay.
Girl if you need a friend I'm in HB, not too far I think! <3 Moved here from NY right before covid so a girl feels you!!
Ugggghhhh watching her continuously cry is  SO SAD man. I do the same thing,  I'm an empath so I'm like beyond sad for Morgan. We love you girl.
off topic, but Morgan that bun is so cute <3 love you stay strong!!
Does any one else feel like Morgan is destined for something great?
I've never related more to a video 😭
Love you Morgan! Thanks for bringing awareness to mental health and how normal it is to feel those things. I’m sorry you’re going through it right now. 💜
I have been feeling the same! Some days are harder than others and it can just ruin each day. Just know the strongest thing you can do right now is keep going and pushing. If that means getting ready each day or even just going on a walk each day, you will feel better, just be patient. We love you Morgan and I wish we were just friends so I can tell you this to your face because I wish someone had told me this to help me ❤️❤️❤️
Don't feel sorry for feeling bad or negative,  that's why we love you girl... you are a regular person just like us and can relate to you so much ❤ know that you're not alone and we are all secretly lost in our life and just trying to find a way to make it through another day. Keep the people in your life that makes you happy because it's a big part of what makes your life positive ✨ be proud of yourself for getting out of bed when you feel most tired or sad cause it takes a lot of effort to even do that when you're in that state of mind. We're blessed that you are alive and we all know of you cause you make our day so much better I don't think you know  how much happier we feel when we see you in your vlogs when we're going through our own personal things in our life. It makes us feel like we're also not alone and we can all be here for each other. Be safe abd take care girl❤
this video is 100%  FACTSSSSSSSS
morgan I love you🥺🥺 you're worth it and so strong!❤️
Deleting Instagram has helped my mental health immensely lol
Also, Morgan your so beautiful.
That’s why it’s so hard for you to move on because you’re wondering how they could so easily but you have to realize it’s literally not you it’s Them whoever they may be. I didn’t have any real friends until the last almost three years of my life, and I’m 31 years old. The right people will just fall into your life and it’ll just be so natural to be their friend. Sometimes I worry that I’m being weird just by checking in with them because I’m so used to not having someone to do that with so babe don’t worry! Everything will fall into place 💖💖💖
Progress is progress no matter how small you think it may be <3
I love you so much girl. Just one day at a time yeah. We got this ❤️
What happened to trinity? We haven’t heard about you mention her for awhile?
Morgan is such a beautiful girl, who has the kindest heart, I so relate to her battles of sadness, but she is very smart with how she deals with my mental health. And this was a great video because I am sure many people are going to relate to this and not feel alone in their struggles.
What the internet actually needs right now. So damn relatable and you are so loved by your audience because of exactly who you are ♥️♥️
Morgan you are so not alone in your feelings. Also... the red dress 🥵
❤️ you
I love that you're sharing the lows instead of hiding them. So many people feel this way and don't share it. Feel the same way myself a lot of days, hard to push through. 🖤
💜💜💜💜💜 Sending love!!!!
Thanks for sharing Morgan. I feel the same way. I was cryin with you girl
Girl, ditto. Myself and many other people understand the pain. Sending you all the love my cold, dead heart can muster up 🧡
Thank you for showing the real version of what depression and anxiety is. What it is like to feel alone and that there is no outlet that helps. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed, and to feel everything and nothing all at once. Always remember we are not alone. Mental health matters. Never be afraid to show this side of you. Stay strong, we love you. 💕
You have absolutely broken my heart Morgan. Jesus heals all wounds❤️ My life has not been the same since I met Jesus and he will wipe away all the hurt in your heart. Much love to you.
Ur so similar to me lol I wonna be your bff
morgan you say EXACTLY what’s on my mind every time you post a video, you are not alone at all. can we be friends
i love you. you’re so strong. we all feel this way sometimes. it’s okay. it’s OKAY.
I feel the same. I'm homesick but I don't even know where that is. I'm looking for myself that is a complete stranger right now. I have done for others my entire life but I don't know how to do for myself. Depression is soo real right now.
It hurts so much to see you cry honestly 🥺 we love you Morgan!
You crying into your eggs and avocado is me whenever I think about trying to eat avocado 🤣 literally live for you, you would obviously be so much happier in Colorado or maybe your apartment that you have is just haunted and sucking the happiness out of you! Definitely look into getting those cameras to make sure you don’t indeed have a frogger like Lizze had suggested. Thank you so much for posting this video, I completely sympathize and can relate LIVE FOR YOU GIRL 🤘🏼 will probably comment as I watch but I’m smoking some pot and watching at the same time (highly ;) recommend for anxiety and depression)
I almost never comment, but I have a few things. 1.) you look amazing in that red dress. 2.) what you're feeling and going through is very real. I know a LOT (far more than normal/average) are dealing with very similar things. It really makes me wonder whats going on that is actually causing it. A LOT of mental health stuff is coming up for people (I'm dealing with it in regards to someone else and it's very serious). Keep doing what you're doing. you're doing a really great job!! 3.) What are you studying/going to school for?  4.) I'm really glad that you're in the world. I think it's really important that you've put your truth out there rather than trying to make it all instagram glossy - that shit isn't real. people want what is real. keep doing you!
Morgan!! You're so amazing and brave to share your most sensitive, vulnerable times with everyone♥. You're so beautiful! And btw, your butt is 🔥 (not creepy - I'm gay AF 😂). Love you girl.
Don’t put your trust in the universe, put your trust in God✝️ I used to be in a bad place too but I feel way more at peace now that I have a relationship and surrendered  my life to the lord😌💞
This is a video I relate to the most . I remember my moment like this was on Christmas when my mom got me clothes the were so small on me and I remembered that I could I wore that size before. I just had a mental break down and hated myself because I gained so much weight .
Love you Morgan! You’re not alone 💜
This is your therapy isn't it? 😜😜 You complain    allllloooooottttttt    my friend but I'm ok with it 😜😜💜💚
It's been so off for so many people lately, myself including. We love you so much Morgan 💕💕💕 you're definitely not alone.
this woman deserves to be having the time of her life with her best friend trinity in the middle of the woods trying to figure out how to set up a tent, Not having breakdowns
I've been literary crying with my fork in the air I swear to God. I'm feeling so much better now but it was rough. Thanks for showing this it makes me feel better and less alone. ❤️
find a roommate!
I feel the same way❤️ idk why either but it truly sucks. If I can get through you, you can too. Ily!!!!!!!!!
Thank you for this video. You get energy by being with others and it’s really hard rn. I’m the same way. You will get through it. Stay strong. Your going the right way even if it feels hard.
Damn, this hits home.
You got this Morgan!
I can relate so much with you. Just have to breathe and do one thing at a time to hit smalls goals for the day to feel good.
Why don't you volunteer? That makes me feel way better
Thanks for posting this, I’m totally on the same vibe atm but we’ll pull through xo
Thanks for keeping it real Morgan.
This was everything! OMG I am so happy you are putting this out there! you are doing great hun <3 and others who are still in bed need to see this.
Morgan you are grieving. And the pain of loss is like nothing else.  I'm so sorry you are going through all of this. Sending love
Aww you look so pretty today.
Love u girl...i feel i was looking in a mirror watchin this i feel you Morgan
The fact that you went and posted this shows self awareness and.. honestly amazing you are working through your issues right now. While sharing it with the rest of us. That cannot always be easy. But I will say this past year has definitely been one of the hardest. And the one thing that never gets easier the older you get: making friends. At least what I think and those around me think. Finding true friends is difficult. I hope you can find your path soon so you can be happy. Be it in Los Angeles or Colorado. Take care of yourself. <3
I love you ♥️
I started crying when u started crying :( life is weird right now lol
And here I am again precious! https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMe5eJ913/
💛💛💛💛
Nothing we say will be able to change the way you feel, but just know you are loved and are so much stronger than you think!   Also- people themselves aren’t “toxic.” Sometimes a person is just toxic for YOU. ❤️
Aww sweetie, my mom-heart breaks for you. Take care of yourself. You are loved, YouTube or not. Sending love from Wisconsin!
Absolutely 💯💯💯! I feel the exact same way girl! I am like 4 classes away from getting my bachelor's and for some reason the last two semesters have been so hard! I have been so hard on myself when I don't get all As or Bs on my assignments even though I have maintained a good GPA this whole time. During quarantine I wasn't doing anything during the summer and I felt useless and now that I am working again ND going to school it feels like way too much! Also my mom passed in 2017 and she didn't see me graduate with my AA and she won't be there for my bachelor's and I think that's getting to me. It pushes me but at the same time it makes me super sad. I feel you girl! This too shall pass! Progress not perfection! ❤❤❤
Be aware and you are half way there ❤️❤️❤️
A lot of the Soul Cycle schtick strikes me as toxic positivity.  Never been there, but that's just the vibe I get from the ads I've seen.
You will get through this. Keep moving, girl. 💕💕💕💕💕💕
Aww Morgan you made me cry... 😩 you are a good person and your videos make me so happy. I literally ubereats..ubereated... Whatever.. Starbucks and sit and drink a coffee anf watch your videos. 🙃✨✨✨✨✨
When you said, you're at a point in your life where you're afraid for the sun to set because that's when all the bad things come out....I felt that. Thanks for posting this video. It made me feel like I'm not alone. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I was just wondering yesterday how you were doing, can’t wait to watch—here’s an AIRHUG (does airhug) love you a bunch xo
I've been feeling the same way, and I just wanna say, that I love you. Also, I agree with you that people aren't toxic. They aren't toxic, they're just toxic to your personality. You don't give love the way they need to be loved, and they aren't showing you love and care and concern in the way you need to feel loved. There are rare occasions where you just aren't heard, and that's because they're just very full of themselves and flat out just don't care about you. But I still agree that they're still not toxic necessarily.
Girl you are just like me.....
I thought I was the only one struggling like this! Thank you for showing us this side of you Morgan. I hope you’re having a great week :)
I’m so sorry that you’re going through it! ❤️ I’m proud of you and you’re amazing and you’re doing great, even if you don’t feel it. Everything will get better! ❤️❤️❤️
Aw I just wanna give Morgan a hug.
Feel so bad for Morgan feeling so sad. On the outside a beautiful, funny, intelligent, charming young woman with a lovely family, beautiful home, loving cat and sucessful job. But the inside I know from when I was in my 20ies. It was a time filled with emotions combined with society expectations to what you should "have" in that age, as to starting a family etc. I was not into that and aging I found the freedom in doing my thing and not thinking about what "I should do". Also, there must be other nice young women in LA, just like you - you just have to find them. They may not be in the Insta/YT world though:-). I feel like you do like LA and being close to Ryland and Shane, but you just need to add a few close friends on top of all you already got going for you. Every young woman would be blessed with a friend like you
Wish we were friends and I could give you a hug 💕 because girl same
we love you, morgan! i'd do anything to have a friend like you. i hope you feel better soon 💖  life can suck so bad, but there will always be ups again
i loved this video, wow. Raw and real and unapologetic. I loved every minute of it. I'm sorry you're going through it, but the world is always a better place with you in it. I look forward to seeing your fun and beautiful face every time you upload! Take care <3
Morgan you are Beautiful inside and out don’t compare yourself to anyone you are GREAT we need more Morgan’s in this world ❤️
Your monster inc comparison 😂
How do they call it *soul* cycle if it's not nourishing your soul? Also Morgan, I know you've read the power of now but if you haven't already go listen to the audible version... Something about Eckharts voice is very calming while simultaneously vocalizing with your higher self 💜💜💜
The DC Villians!!!! The nostalgia man! 😆
Morgan we love you!!! it’s okay to not be okay! learning to be alone in your early 20’s during the pandemic is something i’m also learning and it’s hard! I totally relate to grieving your past life situation. but please know we care and only want the best for you, if you need a break from social media then do it. whatever is best for your mental health is what your fans want ❤️❤️❤️
maybe you need your apartment saged?? seriously it could very well be a super negative energy in your place that is not helping :( life is so crazy and scary right now.....you are doing your best and thats all anyone can expect from you <3
this made me cry because i can relate to it all
I think I said it before . You should move back to near your family . I feel like your much happier . Also , you are doing amazing job being aware of your mental health . I feel like LA is very toxic environment. There is so many people in LA had such a cloud . I’ve seen it in what Emma chamberlain talks about her vlogs even down to Demi lavato who is still having issues with alcohol issues and using . In nut shell a place near your parents  seems to be a positive mental support ! Thank you for making this because people need to see they are not alone 💜 we are here for you too 💜
hey morgan, we are the same age and im also in collage, and i relate to u so much, like 2 days ago it was the last of spring break, and i had so much anxiety about it and i couldnt sleep because i would have panic attack after the other , and ended up not going to school. i dont feel bad about it because im human and i have to deal with these emotions and im happy i did that, my point is that its ok to cry and its ok to feel like youre doing everything but yet still not enough, im in that constantly but if i look at myself from last year ( where i was really depressed) and now im like i made it and if i made it thro that im make it thro this . believe in yourself , were all like that were all going thro it sis.
Thank you for sharing your struggles. I can relate to a lot of what you're going through. July of 2020 I moved out of my parent's house to live with my friend and although it was a smooth transition and I love living with a male roommate, this pandemic has definitely tested my mental sanity (I've had 2 mental breakdowns which I had never experienced before). Starting a new chapter in your life is SO intimidating because you have all of these expectations for yourself: I'm going to find a new job, make new friends, date, get healthier and it blows up into this laundry list of things that never get done because you don't know what you're doing. If it wasn't for my roommate's girlfriend I wouldn't have any friends. She and I have an inside joke which is, "What's happening?" because I'm always saying it and it applies to everything in life. As soon as I felt myself sinking into a depression I started researching ways to get out of that head space and began to journal every night. That has helped a lot. Since you live alone, doing that will feel like you always have someone to talk to when you're feeling lonely.  If you ever need a friend, I don't live in LA but in OC just next door. If you're looking for weird, kind, and creative friends I'm that kinda gal. :) Good luck on your journey and remember nobody knows what they're doing so at least take comfort in that. haha
I hope Morgan knows she’s freaking beautiful anyone would be lucky to be her friend.
I know its hard <3 I've felt that way before and I can only imagine the how hopeless you feel especially during a pandemic. It truly sucks, and I know nothing I can say will make you feel better but I really hope things are gonna fall into places and that the emptiness you feel leaves you for good <3 sending you positive energy✨ You're making incredible efforts and that is a HUGE step torward happiness ! <3 <3 <3 you go glen coco !!!
morgan i love you!!! I hope things get better <33
I called myself “The backseat dweller” for the first seven years at my church. I SO get wanting to be there but be left alone!
I think you need to know for yourself that moving back to Colorado is okay. Like it’s okay to not be okay and accept where you live is not the place you need to be.  Maybe you need to take a step back figure shit out
morgan youre like the brightest and most positive person on the internet please don’t say that you feel stupid it just breaks my heart!!!
Morgan, I just want to hug you and let you know that you are worth it. You never fail to make me feel so much better about myself. I love and appreciate you so much!
Ugh please don’t record yourself crying :((( I hate to see it. I love watching you Morgan 💘💘💘🌤🌤🌞🌞🌞
Everything she said in this video is exactly how I feel. Like I related to this video so much. Thank u Morgan.
Thank you for posting this. And congrats for keep on going, despite feeling so down you still got up in the morning and cleaned out your closet. It’s the little things that really help you grow. Much love and a big virtual hug for you and anybody who feels like they need it now.
Just from watching what you put online, you seem much happier & more comforted in Colorado. I think it would help you because you have your family & friends already established there. I know my momma always makes me feel better & when I’m far away from her, I am instantly more sad.
I felt this so deep inside my soul... I'm so sorry you're going through this... I understand and know what you're saying and feeling... maybe not to the same degree... but I truly empathize with you and go through the same things... like sooo much of what you're expressing... I feel so connected to.... but I really hope you're doing good. I really REALLY do... love you, Morgan 💙
Omg Morgan...💔🥺 We will be here for you all the time..maybe this doesn't mean anything but I really  see you as my family and I feel sad that you're going through this..I hope you get better soon love u so much ❤️
Girl this is it👏🤍
i’m not to that part yet but are you putting stuff on poshmark/depop??
😕😣😫 WHO HERE CAN RELATE TO WHAT SHES GOING THROUGH? Half dead and half alive, like something is off?
You are loved and appreciated. It's okay to feel empty and sad on the inside. I've been feeling that way for 11 years after I lost my fiance. It left a giant void. But girl that red outfit is popping ❤
Morgan you are an inspiration. You are powerful. You are a strong woman! don't forget it! We all love you! I'd love to be your friend :D <3
When you're crying saying everything is okay, I do this so much. We have to stay positive! We can do it <3
Girl ur so pretty
Morgan girl speak your truth and experience, you don’t need to be fake happy here
Morgan, you don’t know me and probably won’t see this comment but thank you. Thank you for always being you and showing me that it’s ok to not always feel the best because I swear at times I feel the same way. Sending you hugs and positive vibes and remember that you’re a bad ass! Love you and your content. 💜
I often wonder if it is just the bad energy of that apartment with its spooks that is bringing your inner energy down that is causing some of your sadness
Wow morgan you look so amazing and have lost so much weight I hope you get over the struggle I go through the same thing girl all the time
morgan when i tell you it broke my heart when you said you don’t think you put positive energy towards other people !!! of course you do everytime i watch your videos im automatically in a better mood ;) i do agree with people saying you should move back to colorado you answered my insta question if wether or not you were moving back and i hoped you’d say yes bcs you can tell that you’re much happier there!!
I don't know why the american culture has this script plan for all the youth, you graduate from high school, go to the other side of the country to get educated, while working your ass off to get a job, get a social life, get good grades, while being all alone for the first time of your life, and having responsibilities that before doesn't stress the shit out of you, you are literally a child. It's very common in a lot of countries to live with your parents until you get some things figured out, And you know what? That lift a very heavy weight from our shoulders, I'm in my last year of university and at least 90% of my classmates live with their parents, it's a normal thing, nothing to be ashamed of. I think that if you feel to get back to your family is the thing you want to do, don't let anything stop you from that, things will get better, I promise, and if you want to give another try to live by yourself then go for it. Send lots of love ❤❤
Imagine feeling the way you’re feeling, while also having to work 40+ hours a week just to keep a roof over your head and food in your stomach.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hi Morgan. I think your vlogs are really great. You show how to love yourself and others in a world that teaches us to love superficial selfishness. We need more content like yours in the world. To show people and especially young pre teens that it's great to be yourself. ❤
Life may feel hopeless and empty but if you put your trust and faith in God, he will guide you towards what you’re meant to do. Jesus really is the way to happiness! He’s given us eternal life if we just listen to Him! I promise life isn’t meaningless and hopeless. You’ll do wonderful things Morgan! I’ll be praying for you!!
When did they stop wearing pants? I missed the memo. Girl, we all go through things. Try to keep in check and know you are not alone sis. Stay well, xoxo 🙀
love this woman
Made me cry at work watching this:( but thank you Morgan for sharing this side of life
I’m saving this to explain someone how I feel
after a difficult week, seeing this made me feel so heard and understood. your mental health is so important to manage. i love you, thank you for being a voice and being so open and honest 💓
Gurl you need to move out that apartment, you need somewhere new and fresh but glad future you is okay now.
Where do you get your glasses at?
As someone who is going through a funk right now, this video it helping a lot! I think its super important to see this side of people because we all relate in some way :)
The best thing I’ve seen so far
Morgan! come to Orange County! We'll welcome you with open arms girly :)
I'm sorry you have to go through this! Don't feel stupid, because I'm sitting here every day feeling like this.. Crying, anxiety, feels like I have no friends.. but your videos makes me so happy! <3 Love from Norway!
You sound like you're waiting for your Soulmate. Someone to share your life with. Waiting......
You’re a beautiful sweet kind person. Things will get better. Deep breaths.
Literally can relate so hard. I’m dealing with health and stomach issues rn. I don’t feel like myself and I feel so lost rn. But this made me feel so much better knowing I’m not alone!
I was the same way allllll through college living in a dorm alone. I cried at least 4 times a day for years. I will say, it does get better. I know you hear that a lot but truly it does. You are so deeply loved and cared for. We love you so so so much and you have to follow your heart ❤️❤️
I'm so sorry you feel that way.  I dnt know you personally but it seems like ur finding it hard in LA, and that's okay. Do you feel happy where ur mum is ? It's okay if LA  isn't for you it's not for everyone. (I'm currently a 3rd way thru the video.) You just dont seem happy in LA, you seem lonely. Oh honey, I'm literally crying with you, I feel the same about my life and this makes you so real and relatable.   Its wonderful having a clear out. Listening to you talk I feel like people have given you an idea of the perfect life and what to do to fit in and perfection. ...okay I've got to the point in the vid where ur saying all of this. Your a wonderful girl. I wish I had friends like you. I have 1 friend, shes gold. I wish I had more but I guess it's important to love what you have.  Ur an amazing girl. Soon life will just click. Take one day as it comes
I needed this. Thank you 🤍
U r not alone.... We Luv U💙We got Ur Back! Thank U for showing Us Ur struggles and Happiness❤️ Thank U for being Real 🤘💙🤗
This breaks my heart bc I can relate so hard. You def aren’t the only one going through it. I’m an old lady and would love to tell you it gets easier but unfortunately it’s a life long process. Your insight and awareness is amazing though and you should be damn proud of yourself.
💗
Thank you for this <3 The past few weeks I have also been feeling exactly like this, and I am usually someone that can pull myself out of it quite quickly. I have had no energy to do anything, been less motivated with work and school, and just felt like life had been sucked out of me. I'm slowly getting back to 'normal' and I am learning to be patient with myself. You are not alone in these feelings, Morgan and I appreciate you sharing this. Also, side note: You are so pretty!!
morgan is literally so stunning
I’ve never related to someone more in my life. You explained it so accurately. The feeling is so deep and all consuming. Sending you good vibes to get through this hump. ❤️
I feel like these whole weekend. What i did to feel better is watch your videos from beginning. I feel 💔 to see you hurt. I hope you feel better.  Just keep swimming 🐠🐟
18:13 that’s why you’re beautiful from the inside out girl. You’re so empathetic
Okay I haven't watched the whole video because I had to pause after the audacity of the spin class instructor. That is a spin class problem, not a YOU problem. That class sounds toxic as hell and I hate that for you. You were just trying to go and get your day started on the right foot. Ugh! I'm so sorry. I immediately got big sis energy and needed to tell you that you are a queen and have so many people rooting for you. Sending love always! 💜
This is just so insanely genuine and relatable and I absolutely love it.
One day at a time Morgan ❤️
It sounds like you were were completely overstimulated and gaslit as well possible had heat stroke... by this spin class. It was extremely toxic! And triggering and not just for you, just hearing about it is beyond awful!! Many of us would have the same response! What can happen when you have past trauma is that when you are exposed to toxic experiences like this your brain reads it as danger! This is to protect you as it has done for many years!! What then can happen is that afterward your brain will have brain fog... as it is trying to navigate through the following days. Brain fog is very real!! And can make you feel like you are loosing your mind at times. I speak from experience.  You are NOT crazy! During times of brain fog you can't focus, it is difficult to find words or to complete any so called simple task. You will also find you are tired. Like exhausted!  Your brain flooding your body with cortisol which in small doses helps us in those fight, flight or freeze times. When you are being constantly flooded with it you have overwhelming feelings or your brain will numb you out. But once you start to come out of the fog it can be insanely confusing and we overthinking the fuck out of it! And blaming ourselves is often what happens! When it is not your fault at all!! Talk therapy can help you make sense of what is happening. Be gentle and kind with yourself!
“It’s not a breakdown its a breakthrough.”- Morgan Adams, 2021
Morgan, I really appreciate you posting this, even though I know it was probably hard to be so vulnerable.  I cried along with you because I relate so much to how you're feeling.  Sending you so much love!!
Yeah I wanna cry over the fact that I cant find these specific cookies where I live at now but I know I woukd be ok its just cuz Im overly stressed and over thinking... I love Morgan because shes so real
Hey Morgan! I can’t remember if you mentioned this but are you donating or selling the clothes? I’m sure a lot of us would buy them if you put them on Poshmark or Depop. I’m definitely looking for new clothes!! :) and I LOVE one of the glasses you said no to!  Also, sending lots of love to you always. 💗
You're my favorite person on youtube and I am so sorry you're going through it. I've been there. You are SO cared about and I hope you know that. <3
I always rush to watch your videos, and you literally vocalized all the feels I've had recently too. Thanks for sharing Morgan, I know it was soooo hard...
If you had to work a normal 9-5 you wouldn't have time for all this self doubt and deprecation. You are super privileged to even be able to have these thoughts.
They call it a waterbed.....hee hee hee.
It's natural for humans to have a negativity bias. It's completely okay to feel anxious or negative. No one is happy all the time. Recognizing it, accepting that it's a normal thing to feel, and then creating positive coping habits are how to work through it. It's a lifelong process as well but if you keep working at it, it gets easier. :)
Hey girl. A suggestion from someone who is really just a fan, I just don't know if LA is for you. Come home, head down to Colorado Springs, hit me up, let's be friends. ❤
Watching this vlog was like therapy... some of the things you said really spoke to me and helped. Thank you from the UK. Xx
I feel you Morgan... i feel you stay strong ❤️
at least you weren't screaming in a silent gym 💙
damn you're killing that red dress!😍😍
This video really helped me this morning. Literally had a mental breakdown at work when I was alone last night closing and felt like absolute garbage the whole day. I really hope that happiness returns in my life and that self doubt can f--k off. Morgan, I love that you keep it real and honest with yourself and your fans. Things will get better 🥰
I must say that this video was perfect for me today. I was feeling the exact same way you were feeling. I just moved out on my own and I’m going through some of the same things you are. My students always tell me that I am just like Morgan Adams and I love hearing that.  Living in LA can get pretty lonely even though you’re surrounded by so many people. I totally understand where you’re coming from. Thank you for your video
Brb putting tiki torches in my room just to feel something
Morgan if you need a friend I’m here!
😘😘😘
Aren’t instructors at soul cycle supposed to be supportive and not make you feel bad?
How’s trinity ? I hope u guys are still good, I feel like she can help you ❤️ she is a good friend, love u guys !
Do you need to be in LA, petal? 💗 LA is like one giant work convention. Youre such a sensitive, empathetic person. It must be so difficult to navigate such a world where everyone wants contacts before they want friends 😔 I honestly think that's the bad vibe you're picking up on. You're such a genuine person. Could you be innately sensing the disingenuous nature of the city? And struggling to let your guard down because of it?  The best thing about being a vlogger or making online content is that you can do it from wherever in the world you want to.  People love you and would watch you whether you were in LA or in a van scooting around the place or if you lived in a cabin in the woods (spooky tho) or if you lived back at your moms house.  Hope you feel better soon. Keep your head up!! xx
it felt like you were speaking everything I've been feeling. thank you for posting this. i lost the majority of my friends last year  its been hard to cope  seeing this i don't feel so alone we take it day by day and that's ok. sending so much love to you morgan :)
This probably isn’t helpful but I like to listen to sad music when I’m sad and spiral. Listen to 10,000 weight in gold by The Head And The Heart. It sounds like what you’ve described feeling like.   Wish I could give you a hug and be sad with you 💕
Puts leopard dress & puffy coat on: “No, no, just no....should I wear this to the store right now?” 😂😂   -But seriously, we love you Morgan, you’re not alone. 💛
This you being Morgan is the reason I started watching for you in Shane and Rylands videos... the good the bad the real you never sugarcoat the world... your our relatable queen thanks for continuing to be real 💕
We’re all here for you!!! ❤️
was hoping that brain scan thing would have helped....that guy is on Dr. Phil all the time now, so I dont have much faith in him....
This resonates so much with me it’s comforting knowing others feel the same
Please go out with Lizzie❤️
You are sooooo gorgeous inside and out girl 🦄 keep living your best life , best vibes Morgan ✨
Just wish I could hug you because I can tell how much you're hurting. take care of yourself, Morgan.
I wish I had an answer for you Morgan, how to get to that “breakthrough” moment where you stop feeling that way. I do believe age is one of those things that help mental stability but deciphering why you are feeling that way is crucial, too. Low self esteem, lack of confidence, conflict avoidance  because you want to please people coz you’re a good person, or simply, want to feel needed or useful, but hurts getting taken advantage of, you feel empty coz you’re lonely and by being an introvert it doesn’t make it easy for you to make true friends.... all this, has different solutions and you,ll have to find it, be it reading self help books, therapy, going on a trip, just don’t give up on yourself.
Scream in public or be a bottom feeder... my mood for 2021
Morgan. There are a lot of people like you. It’s due to a higher IQ and a true empath. But it’s so impressive that you’re getting up and doing daily things. I’m 31 and I still can’t do that.
Mood tbh
Can you start posting on Tik Tok? 😭❤️
Leave LA girl! You need to head back to CO stat
It’s ok to not be okay! RIP Lee #speakoutforlee mental health is a major illness and needs treatment just as much as a broken leg needs treatment.  Reach out to your friends and family, make sure they are ok and support them through their hard days and I love you
Girl you are so not alone ❤️ I’m going through something very similar right now and let’s just say I feel completely lost too. Love you and thanks for opening up and sharing your struggles too 🙏🏽
This was such a good video all around. I love you Morgan
I'm 24. And you are not alone in dealing with transitional times in life. Thank you for making me feel less alone in that
Guess what Morgan, being yourself, even though it’s difficult, and being able to recognize your struggles and share them to the world makes you a hero to many people. Just remember that. You’re helping others to know they aren’t the only ones feeling this way! KUDOS! ❤️
Virtual hug (cause that’s not weird).  Just know that you made my day just by posting a video.  It will get easier...then harder....then easier.  There’s no perfect place to live, no perfect life.  You’re still so young and you have no idea what adventures await.  ❤️
I know you are not looking for sympathy but it breaks my heart to see you sad.  I am hopeful you will find your way and find contentment.
I appreciate you
MORGAN! I THINK YOUR GREAT AND DOING GREAT! I hope you feel better soon!! 💗💗💗
We love you babe keep your head up
I have been through (and still go through) what you are feeling. Keep taking your meds and talking to your doctor about how you feel. Force yourself to go outside and spend time with people. Also, you and your hair look beautiful! ;)
Omg i get what you are saying about feeling empty and having no feelings at all or No Motivation. I think this year has been really dificult for alot of people. I never had this until now..i Hope you feel better soon
I don’t want to frighten you and I don’t even know if you’ll see this but there’s a really negative entity attached to you and they’re feeding from your life source. You really need to see a professional witch to cleanse you and banish it. It’s like you’ve been hexed but not by another human being?  I might sound crazy to some people but it’s worth it if you see this and seek help with it. Much love 🖤✨
Honestly never related to a video more
Watching Morgan cry makes me tear up and just want to give her the biggest hug ever. We love you so much Morgan, thank you for showing us a side of you that’s “not perfect”, because life isn’t perfect. You made me feel not alone, and I’m sure you have helped many others as well. Just keep pushing through, and know that you are loved and appreciate. I hope you have an amazing day pretty girl!❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️
This is exactly how I’ve been the last 2/3 weeks. I’m in a new job that’s something WAY outside my comfort zone and I’m having a really hard time trying to cope with it. You crying over your eggs and saying it’s okay while crying was LITERALLY ME. I keep trying to remind myself everything is going to be fine I just have to be patient with myself but it’s S O   H A R D ! We’ll get through it eventually though. I like what you said, it’s not a breakdown it’s a breakthrough. I think I’ll use that 😌
This is the first video I’m watching on my new phone 🥰 I hope you’re feeling better Morgan you got this ❤️
I really needed this video. My life feels like its in some chaos and I sooo needed to hear, "You can have a bad day, but that doesn't mean your life is over" 😭😭😭Thank you girlie for keeping it real! ❤❤
_It's depression, not your fault. You can get through it Morgan. Don't worry it's normal to go through mental health struggles. Stay strong and when it's hard to be positive don't chastise yourself just because that weird woman did at the workout bike thing... She sounds like a wanker, I'm sorry. XD Sending love from Liverpool UK ♡_
This is literally so relatable. It’s not even watching it like awwwww Morgan. It’s like yes! Exactly lmao. I feel like this is a vlog of my life a couple weeks ago. Ugh. It’s gets better 😊😊😊 love your vlogs
Love you , you will be okay❤️
Hi Morgan! I have watched your blogs forever & I swear I always relate to you. As someone in their late twenties who lives alone idk I just get it. I hate sunsets too for that reason & really thought I was the only one. But you’re kind, you’re smart & so wonderful. Be gentle with yourself. Keep making moves forward. You got it locked down. Imagine the woman you want to be & make simple steps towards her. & if you can’t see her today, then don’t take it as defeat just have patience 💗💗
We love you Morgan. You’re never ever alone, keep going 🤎
i love u morgan, u will get through this ❤️ we all will!
Sending you absolutely massive, positive vibes right now!!  You're so amazing lady 😍😍
Girl. Glad you posted. I feel you so much and you’re not alone. We are just different but not bad people. The world makes us think we’re not normal because the standard norm only fits a few. Just like in school, some kids can learn by reading then applying, but some kids like me, need to talk through things and work hands on. Neither on is bad, but one is more standard and normalized then others; the thing we need to realize is both situations is normal for the individual, and that’s just fine. Love your trying, your growth, and you as a person. Keep inspiring yourself and you will inadvertently inspire others!
i love you so fucking much ♡
I feel you. I've been in the depths of excruciating depression for months. My mother, my last living relative passed from Covid in January and I feel so alone and scared without any family. It's hard to find reasons to live.
OK! Your bum looks AMAZING in ALL THE JEANS! You should keep all the sunglasses (but the dc's gotta go) and look so incredible in the red dress! Girl we all feel like this sometimes, it gets easier I promise! Sending virtual hugs!! I always feel like this but podcasts, long walks and self care HELPS! I know it sounds hippie but I recently got into meditation, crystals and chakra balancing etc I mean you could try something like this. There's a lot of  Spiritual podcasts that I Iisten too maybe it will help! Just wanted to leave some love xxx there universe will clear the way for you, you just have to be patient xx
Thanks for posting this 💕
I really hope she in therapy because YouTubers seem to perpetuate this idea that it's normal and quirky to have mental breakdowns but never seem to add resources for their viewers who may be in need of professional help or they never seem to put in the work to reach out and get help. I understand if people have bad days but this has been an ongoing reoccurring theme for her.
You look SO good in that red dress!!
I’ve never related more to a video
no matter what, the most important thing is that you always remember that things will get better, you will feel better. <3
I don't know why this video is literally me right now, i lost so many people in my life including my two closest friends that left me and it's been a year and i haven't moved on, i just feel hopeless i don't have anyone plus in my country everything is falling apart no government no school no money nothing, I don't even know why I'm living rn.
Hi sweetheart. I hear you and whew, really identify with what you said at 18:05 regarding ppl carrying around past hurts. It’s not just ppl that are toxic that are the way they are because of unhealed hurts, it’s people like you and I and soooo many others who are amazing adults, moving forward, engaging when ughhh we’re happy to be home with our cat.   I’m 58 years old and honey? I hear you and man o man I get it. I work for State of CA, love where I live, and yet still feel stunted from a betrayal decades ago.   You, sweet and beautiful young lady, are on a perfect path. You’re back in school, you’re trying new things, (soul cycle)? Find one better suited for YOU! Perhaps visit them in action before jumping on,   Morgen Adams, I hope to never EVER hear you refer to yourself as stupid. Clutzy? SURE! Found out in 2012 that I’m going blind with retinitis pigmentosa (💓 Molly Burke), and it was bittersweet to get this news when I was only seeing optometrist for sassy readers. I have 20/20 vision to this day but its closing in peripherally.   That sweet in bittersweet is 3-fold as I realized why even as a child I walked into door facings, tripped over design in carpet, 😆, etc. Most are totally blind by 50 yrs old and I cal still see! I Facetime with my grandson in Florida, I see buds and flowers all around me as spring is springing.   I’ve been single for decades and love it. My Gracie kitty turned 9 on April Fools Day and I love having another heartbeat in my apartment.   Concentrate on the positives honey. You have so many people that love you. Please love yourself and never talk down to yourself. One of my favorite quotes is from Louise Hay, “It’s okay to make mistakes as we learn.” Another is William Shakespeare’s quote that, “No thing is good or bad until thoughts make them so.”   I hope you see this and I hope it helps you or anyone else reading this that loves and enjoys you.   Be good to yourself. (((hug)))
I can fully relate to the breakfast breakdown 🤣😂🤣
Yeah LA does that to you. I grew up there and was miserable. Moved to Colorado and now I'm SO much more happier. Not necessarily happy but just neutral. Don't have to deal with racists anymore so my quality of life has significantly improved 😊
We love you, Morgan!
Thank you for this video, i kind of live the same things and that’s haaaard.. love love ❤️
Move back to Colorado you seem so much happier there! Screw the American dream in LA it's not worth being so down all the time.
This was sad.
🥺🥺🥺🥺 Morgan we love!!!!!!!! You!!!! 💖💖
Needed this
I get the emptiness feeling. I honestly felt that before going to church and giving my problems to Christ. I know Christianity has not been represented well at all in society now, but God just wants to relieve you of this emptiness and give you hope! I love you:')
I think you need to sit at the beach a bit more . That shit is so therapeutic . Something about shoving your feet in the sand and listening to crashing waves 🌊.
i love you morgan and i will be your friend. find me on instagram! : D
Morgan really has no idea how many of us related to this video and/ or needed it! Wishing you all the best Morgan ✨✨✨
as an anxious person, soul cycle classes sound like my actual nightmare
Morgan i gotta know your horoscope sign/ chart 😫i’m sending you all my love!
Girl we all gotta grow up sometime, but that doesn't mean moving out of state to a place that drains us. Move back to Colorado with your friends and family, get your own place and still be able to have that human interaction that you need from your support team!! Keep making blogs too!! Much love!!
Honestly this is the content I want. It's honest real raw true. 10/10
I'm crying with you Morgan. I feel the same way.  I've been trying to catch up with friends, working harder, trying to take care of myself, but I feel like nothing will make me feel human.  I just want to curl up in a ball all the time.
Morgan, Just be who you are , don't let other people tell you how to be, be yourself, you matter. Red is a great color on you,
I am so so so thankful you posted this. I felt like I was literally looking in a mirror the entire video. I LOVE YOU! You are helping so many people with this video and please stay strong because you’re bravery is so inspiring!
Thank you for being so vulnerable and posting this vlog! I’m definitely going through it too, in a very similar way, and you put a lot of my feelings into words. It is comforting to know that someone else is experiencing similar things to me, although I’m sorry you’re struggling too. Hope things will get better for you and thank you for always being so open and honest with your content🖤
I love how honest you are ty for your videos
Morgan, you are absolutely gorgeous inside and out. This is video is going to help so many other people who are currently standing in a room full of people but they feel completely alone. I would love to be your best friend :P Have you thought of getting a room mate? x
Me seeing Morgan cry: “I’ve never seen a YouTuber actually cry real emotional pain tears dang” ☹️ Love you Morgan, we’re here to listen to you and accept you ! 💓 Edit: it’s sucks being told your whole life youre a “bottom feeder” just bc you’re shy or depressed. That’s a whole ass representation of  not understanding mental health. Thank you for sharing your mental states with us because I know I’m really hard on myself bc I think nobody else deals with this. This is why I love you Morgan!!! This is courageous af 😭❤️ when I feel like this I just clam up and cry and watch adventure time and I don’t go to work. I’m a stripper so I can do that :b but I don’t hate myself for being like this.. at the moment lmao
Is it weird to say this video inspired me?? It’s SO relatable to what I’m going thru rn and seeing someone else push thru everyday like me makes me want to keep going and get better 💪🏼 Damn girl, thanks for sharing 💜 Now were off to conquer the world!!
You need to get a dog. You are never alone when you have a dog. And it gives you structure and rutine. My dog is my best friend.
Also thank Cthulhu for cats and all fur babies and their unconditional love
Seeing you say "Its ok, I am ok" while crying was so heart breaking but at the same time so honest! I feel that way plenty (especially these days) and sometimes just need to let it all out.  This was so amazing to see and I hope you realize that you are one of the most real youtubers out there. keep showing us your real life thats what people love about you!!!
Thanks for this ❤️
When you said that you feel like you put good energy out into the world, but it doesn’t feel like you’re getting anything back is SO RELATABLE. I’m 25 and was feeling that way, so empty...I’ve never been religious, but found a church with good people and it changed my life. God gives life a purpose. I love you and prayed for you!! You deserve all the happiness in the world❤️❤️❤️
literally cried 20 mins ago about this........... Get out of my head morgan. BUT actually thank you for sharing!
You are definitely not crazy or alone. Depression, as in the illness, can hit people in waves. Not just with the seasons, but similar to how hormones fluctuate. Even when you're doing the right things, it can make you feel horrible and hopeless deep inside. The things that you feel, like being happy to see friends and feeling pretty are real feelings, and it's not to say the sad feelings aren't real, but they're amplified and worsened by chemicals in your brain. It might be worth getting a psychologist/therapist with psych licensing for a consult.  Also, listen to the gut and constant feeling about being unhappy in LA. There's a marked difference between your vlogs in CO and the ones in CA.
Sending love and happy vibes!
Thank you for sharing this. I’m going through the exact same thing.. except I don’t have a social life from moving to a new city during covid and it’s so lonely!
Thank you for sharing! 💕 This was literally me all last week.
fuck i really felt that my depression is really trying to kill me this year and last year. i was literally stuck fully clothed in an unfilled bathtub last night not going well
You’re killing it and amazing! Even if it feels like life makes no sense and is falling apart. Devil Wear’s Prada moment: That's what happens when you start doing well at work. Let me know when your entire life goes up in smoke, means it's time for a promotion.
"Symtom" 1 😅😅
Morgan this hurts my heart so much. I think of us as being such good friends, your videos are the ONLY videos I ever want to watch. The vibes are so amazing, even if it’s a video like this. Thank you for sharing I can’t imagine how hard that is. With that being said, I think you need to be with people who are best for you and be where you need to be. If you decide to move back home near your mom, WE WILL FOLLOW YOU 💛 as long as you decide to share your life with us, I will be here for it. I don’t know you, but I love you!! Sending you prayers and good vibes. It’s not easy but you will make it through. 💕
thank you for posting this
morgan if you made a depop i would buy so much of what you’re getting rid of 😂 also you are loved and i hope you feel better soon girly 🤍🤍
most relatable video on youtube
Morgan you are very loved! Thank you for being real. You are definitely not alone with how you are feeling. Life throws so many situations and challenges at us but it will always work out ❤️ keep being you
Morgan you are so beautiful and a great person. I truly wish you can find your inner peace. I love you and watch you all the way from Argentina, South America.
Morgan. Your videos have always made me laugh and smile. Girl I wish I could hug you and tell you everything will get better and you need to look inside your heart and follow what it wants if LA is not for you, find what is life's to short to be anything but happy! I wish I had a friend like you, your bubbly, fun, caring and honest heart is hard to find! You are not the only one going through any of this... I lost my dad 4 months ago and I've been struggling really bad myself. But you've got this girl ! If you ever need an extra friend I'm here for you 💞
Someone told me once that if you're feeling hopeless to do something nice for someone else. Helping others can sometimes help you. I don't know about all that but what I do know is that I can relate to how you're feeling right now and you're not alone. I love you, Morgan. I hope everything works out for you!
Maybe think more about moving home for a little while, Morgan 💜. You can always comeback to California if you need to, but I think you should try it because you were so happy. Also, sometimes I think a girl needs her mom (or whoever your person is). Colorado is my favorite and I love being in the mountains. I love just sitting there and being surrounded by things that are bigger than my depression, and it’s uplifting.
Morgan! Sending lots of hugs!! And guess what!??!! Everything will be OKAY 🥰😘❤️ just give it a little time and you will be just great! PS.. You are awesome sauce!
Morgan I think you might feel so depressed because you’re doing all these things that other people think you should. Prime example would you be saying that “I’m going out with people, doing school, and what I need to do.” You need to figure out what you believe is important and stay true to that. If putting a pool in your room is what is gonna maybe make you happy go for it. You need to be you to be happy because otherwise you’re living vicariously.
Your soul is not meant for California. It’s destined for far more and you’re deserving of far more🥰
Morgan seemed more happy in Colorado. Please move back for your  own mental health 🙏🏾
I relate to this so much. Your not alone 💔
This it exactly what I’m going through but instead of friends I’m trying to find work nd hoping I make friends lol
I think it would really greatly benefit you to seek medical help!! There might be a cause to these feelings that could be directly related to health! I was experiencing the same feelings and it ended up being my thyroid so it could help you!! Love you <3
So relatable to so many people! But also super sad because just watching you you feel like a friend and I want to yell “I’m here for you. I’d love to hang out with you even if we just watched Netflix and did nothing”  keep trucking along woman, your twenties can be so confusing, when you’re 30 you’ll be like “I don’t give A shit anymore” and it’s the best feeling
I cannot imagine how Morgan feels. I love being alone! In fact, I start getting squirrelly after 3 days of being being surrounded by people.
Why are we the same person, I literally had the worst week of my life last week too, sending so much love xx
I’m going through the same issue. All I want to do is lay down, isolate, even from phone calls & texts, I’m used to getting up early showering, putting on makeup, cute clothes. Is it Covid related depression?
Morgan you’re so beautiful!!!
I really needed this video, thanks!!
That instructor needs to realize people don’t pay for “negative reinforcement “.  She must be an acquired taste...... NOT
Thank you for always sharing the true authentic you. I love you and your openness to your mental health helps me and probably so many others feel more normal! ❤️❤️ also virtual hug to you!!
The worst part is she probably doesn't even remember doing this and she's taking up so much space in your brain :(
I hope you are good. and I kinda see you with jake paul I ship it #jakeandmorgan
same.
I feel you🤍 I read something one day, can’t remember where or who it was from, but it essentially said that even if you do everything that people say it makes them feel better (meditate, exercise, go out of your comfort zone, etc.) it is just patching the deeper wound. And the more you supress your feelings, the more they will come out, and the more aggressively. I feel exactly like you sometimes, so freaking empty, lots recently, and I came to the conclusion that I need to go deeper, see a therapist, and find out what the heck is happening, so that I can finally work on that. Wishing you the best Morgan🤍
I love you, Morgan! Thank you for being real and so relatable. You are my favorite YouTuber. I moved to LA a year and half ago and I still don't really have friends here either and somedays you just need to let it all out. You are strong and you are killin' it!
My assignment can wait 20 minutes :)
you are  so real....thank you....it all gets better
watching you glow the fuck up in this video was amazing
Thank you for this. This last week has basically been the same for me. It’s been a lot of crying and panic attacks while screaming about how okay i am and everything is fine... ITS FINEEE. I have no idea where any of it’s coming from though x.x i just feel kind of numb and tired  lately
Girl you are loved and it’s gonna be ok ♥️
It's time to go HOME peanut.  Maybe Ryland will follow.  I think everyone needs out of the toxic (yes, toxic kiddo) cesspool that is LA.  Sending air hugs covered in light and love your way.  :0)
🖤🖤
Watching Morgan cry is making me cry it’s so sad.. ☹️☹️
Definitely been here within these last few months, February my life was simultaneously falling apart all while living the best days of my Fucking life. I got rid of all my clothes, I cut my Fucking hair, I went from black to blonde, sis CHANGE is so important when you hit a new chapter. Grow through what you go through🖤
And the sad thing if I feel the exact same way as Morgan. She explains everything perfectly.
Morgan, this video broke my heart. I’ve also been struggling lately. And I almost cried when you talked about trying to put good energy out and give people the best version of you because I feel that exact same way sometimes. It’s hard when you do your best and it feels like good things don’t come back to you. You can do this!
First of all, going to the cycling class when feeling the way you did is brave. The cycle instructor is tone deaf. Positive sign you want to be with others and kudos for recognizing life changes. You are a good person. Not going to say any platitudes - who did they ever make feel better. I really appreciate your approach to dealing with your feelings. Thank you Morgan.
I just sent this video to my girlfriend with time stamps to convey how I feel on the day to day. I can never put into words how I felt from within but she’s so caring and willing to understand that I wanted to make her understand. Thank you so much Morgan. You’re definitely not alone in this and yes, that doesn’t they’ll but please hold on. 🤍
✌️❤️
thank u so much for being so honest, you are really strong ❤
Even though that soul cycle instructor was a b you looked sun kissed and beautiful in this video. I love how honest and raw you are and I live for every upload. Stay strong bestie ✌🏼
Morgaaaaaaaaan, i'll be your friend. Hang in there girlie
"I'm at a point in my life where I'm afraid for the sun to set because that's when you feel everything" wow...that hit home. Thank you for your raw and realness. It doesn't fix where I'm at but at least I know I'm not in the dark alone you know?
Morgan, I identify so much with how you feel. So damn much...
🖤🖤
Love you. Hang in there.  You have our support and love.  <3
❤️
When you say 'everything's OK' more than 5 times in a row, you know it's not, I felt that
Omg Morgan, I have literally been feeling the exact same the passed 2 weeks..  Right when I saw that you had posted I was so excited and then I read the title and just cried because I am not alone and neither are you.. ❤ I feel a little lame, but its like having a friend who understands and thats a little comforting.   Its so hard and tiring doing things and being around people that should make us happy, but just feeling a constant impending doom.. But IT WILL be okay & we will be okay. I hope you never forget you are not alone and that you help people so much more than you know by just being your genuine raw self.  I appreciate you so much Morgan, please dont underestimate your positive effect on the world!! 💕
Morgan, when you were in Colorado making over your old room you felt fulfilled because you had a process, everyone needs a process. Find yourself a new process and you will see a big difference! You are a bad ass who brings joy!!
Ugh, this was so heartbreaking but kinda refreshing to see from you, Morgan. I've been so down bad in my life lately, life everything about my life is exactly what I feared of having. And I was never one to compare and covet other people's lives, but now I find myself romanticizing their lives. Because everyone I know seems to be moving forward and meanwhile I try to be a good person and work hard and be logical, but I've never felt more hopeless. It's cool to see you, someone who does youtube for a living and has an apartment in LA (a life I dream of)feeling almost identical feelings. We're told influencers have breakdowns like anyone else but until we see it, we don't really believe it. Appreciate you ♡
I literally cried an hour before I saw this video got posted, I'm so sorry you're going through this rough patch but it's nice to know I'm not alone. We'll get through this! ❤️
I feeeeeeeeeeeelllll this way toooooo much
I feel like this clog is me rn
I love you a stupid amount fr. I’ve never felt every word of a video like this. Baby that city is toxic. Come to Missouri 😝❤️
I relate 100000% to how you feel. Thanks for sharing. Keep being strong. You’re an absolute adorable human being. Creative, fun, empathetic. Sending you lots of love and hugs (if you’re into hugs) 💕
I have been going through exactly what you’re going through, it’s like you look in the mirror and don’t recognize yourself, it’s such a weird feeling to try and explain but you’re not alone in this 💕
That cycling class sounds like a nightmare.
I love that you put up this video, Life is really testing me lately and it's nice to know I am not the only one.
Oh honey, thanks for sharing. I've been there. Finding an awesome counsellor changed my life,and I hope you consider finding one too. Things will shift for you
I totally get feeling alone & lost, wondering what your life e en means. I'm alone  & trying to cope with a unexpected death at the same time.  I feel like I have lost any reason to be here. I walk thru each day thinking I will find or come to understand why, to be able to smile again.  Just knowing others are feeling the same as you may help.
Ily Morgan ❤️❤️ Some advice for you if you ever were to see this.. I think you should move back to Colorado. You were so bright and happy there. And it seems like just being alone in La is affecting your mental health.
I am really concerned for you Morgan. For someone that has high depression and has gone back to therapy you really need to do the same and get the help you need because you deserve happiness <3
💜💜💜 we love you!
Morgan, you are so stunning and I love how transparent and raw you are even when you’re going through it. Not many influencers are willing to show how vulnerable they are and that is very refreshing. Keep your head up queen 👑💕
CAN I PRETTY PRETTY PRETTY PLEASE PLEASE BE YOUR FRIEND MORGAN PLEAAAAASSSSSSEEEEEEEEEE
Your ex sounds gay
Sometimes it hurts more when you have a great life and feel this way. It’s like everything around you is great... but you aren’t. When that happens it hurts even more because you know it’s only you
I hate that I cried watching this video just because it reminds me of my sad self😭 but anyways just remember that you have the right to feel how u feel. I'm so proud of you for being aware of your mental health and trying your best everyday Ly❤️❤️❤️❤️

I think you need a dog. I know you have Cookie, but a dog makes such a bigger presence in your life. My dog gave me something to live for, he needs me to get up and out of bed to walk him. I have to get outside for him.
Sending a big hug. You are beautiful and so special. 😘
Wait but can I have the clothes and glasses your ridding of 😩😩
Seeing you crying really made me want to hug you. I love you so much Morgan! Please, keep going! You made it this far and we are so proud of you!!! Sending you all the hugs and love!!!!
Morgan,I hate to see you upset. (;_;) Because you are naturally a really positive person and I enjoy watching your videos .Sometimes I feel that way too .Any ways just wanting to say you are AMAZING and I'm bing watching your videos  (❁º◡º❁).     <(￣3￣)>
Morgan I’m sorry to see you go through all this shit trust me it ain’t easy as a sufferer of daily anxiety or deression it’s like a coin flip but tbh watching your videos has honestly shown me that fighting is possible and you are a strong person remember we are al here for you
The days you find it hard to love yourself, there are people who love you for just being you. Not for a particular trait or something you do. They'll love you, all of you. May you lean on that love ❤️✨ Love you Morgan❤️
You got this Morgan!! This is like a transition period to really becoming your own person! You’re a bad bitch who will find her way. I believe you’ll be doing great things that make YOU happy ♥️
Omg. We love you 🖤
I would say I have fealty this way before. Being used to being around people and then suddenly being alone and not knowing what to do and feeling alone is hard. I would suggest trying to get into something. I found it helpful to get into kickboxing as a work out. Having that to look forward every other day made it easier for me to be alone. When I felt really depressed I would just get in my car, put on some happy music and just drive. That really helped my mood. Also hanging out with friends when nothing else helps is also good.
Oh babe you are stunning and the fact that you’re so open about your struggles is amazing, I wish more people where like you. It’s ok to not be ok.
I'm sorry that you are going through it, but thank you for posting this. It helps people like me in that same mind set know what I'm not alone 💜
Same... Your not alone
Thank you thank you thank you for sharing how you feel and what youre going through. So many people feel these things and think they are alone because a lot of folks in the public eye only show the good. It is important to remember we are all human and allow room for ourselves to make mistakes, be imperfect, and have bad days! You're a beautiful and incredible woman and keep doing you.
Can we talk about how stunning she looks 🤩
It's always the good people who suffer. Remember Morgan that you are feeling this because you are extremely aware. It's the douches who go around not caring about anyone but themselves and live a good life.
watching Morgan have a breakdown while repeating "everything is fine" made me feel 200% less alone because i do the same thing at least weekly
Thank you for sharing your not good days with us Morgan. It is a reminder that people on the other side of the screen are humans too.
Can we just appreciate how much Morgan has grown as a person? Like I could learn so much from her attitude and what how she is reacting to everything. Girl, even at your low you are GLOWING
It is ok to admit you are not ok 💜 I know a lot of us have been though similar situations or are going through them right now. Some days the world feels like its beating you down for no reason. But then the sun shines. You see something looks a little brighter than it did; that little ray of hope - a spark. The spark breathes the fire in your soul back to life. You start to see the path isn't all brambles and thorns, its roses and ferns, trees stretching up to the sky, soaking up the light. You start to hear the birds singing and the bugs chirping and you can smell the earth alive around you.  And then you start to feel ok. You start feeling a bit stronger. Little things that made you feel so defeated start being easy - even manageable again. And then you start moving forward, this time at your own pace. You find your own sense of peace, your own form of comfort in moving forward as you are, imperfectly perfect, and exactly as you are meant to be.
I have to say it sounds like you may have connected Los Angeles and your apartment with a lot of negative feelings and trauma and you might feel so free in Colorado bc you have good memories and aren’t trying to prove yourself or force yourself to be a certain way there! I think Colorado is prob a good place for you. You always have Shane and Rylands I house for visits.
I feel like nobody talks about the loneliness one might experience in their 20s. A lot of people move out of your life while it becomes a lot harder to find more people to connect with because you develop standards for people you want to have in your life.
My only comment here has to do with the cycle instructor. Her ignorance is amazing and she needs to be dealt with. You need to make a phone call to the owner and if it's her....tell her to f... off. Grab control don't let those kind of people control you. It takes more energy to dwell on bad things than it is to be content. Take control and live life for you. Have a relationship with yourself......do what you want....no more obsessing. You can't love anyone else if you don't love yourself 😎
Aw Morgan, it looks like you actively trying to change your mindset.  Have you ever tried Reiki?  Reiki is a pure love energy that can be used to help heal the past, present and future.  It can also help with psyical, emotional and spiritual healings. I am a Reiki Master Teacher and do offer distance Reiki healing privately and offer sessions on YouTube as well.   If I can be of service in some way please just let me know.💗💜💗💜 Lots of love and light @beckydholistics
the number of times I wanted to give you a hug throughout this video!!! thank you for the content queen
We love you Morgan ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Morgan, watching this absolutely broke my heart. I am so sorry you are feeling this way and know we all love you. You deserve all the happiness regardless of your life circumstances and whether "someone else has it worse".you are so special, loved and worthy. Sending you all my love and positive vibes. 💖
I’m proud of u✨
I feel like we are the same person. I’ve been going through it as well. Hold your head up high. You are a wonderful person and I love you!!
I feel you dude, the fact that you're getting up everyday though and trying to go out is amazing! you should be so proud of yourself because that ish is hard af lol You've definitely given me some inspiration to do the same. love you morgan!! <3
you’re one of my favourite youtubers ❤️
Sis, Iv loved you work online and your heart is so evident! I wish we were friends in real life because Id tell you, girl get out of LA. Go somewhere new! If you're ever in Dallas drinks on me! youve got this!
Morgan seems like such a genuinely nice person. I think the important thing to remember is being sad can sometimes be so good for the soul. It doesn’t mean that you are inadequate, it means that you are taking the time to understand your emotions. And that is so healthy! I’m so excited to see Morgan mention the “growth” that is happening underneath and opening up about how life isn’t perfect; so relatable and such an important message.
thank you for deciding to post this💖
i genuinely want to hug u right now. You are so loved. dont ever forget. everything will work out in the end <3
Morgan! I feel you!, I was the same but just keep your faith, God is the only answer. 💓
If I could choose only one person to be friends with for the rest of my life, it would be Morgan❤️
"First of all, I am depressed." Me.
I've been going through similar conflicts. I am in my last semester of college and my mental health has never been worse. At this point, I just want to give up but I am so close to the end so I am trying to hold out for one more month. I have to keep reminding myself that this is just a small part of my entire life and things will work themselves out. I just want to get my happiness back :(
This is completely relatable and I’m glad you’re showing us this side of you because it’s something a lot of people (and youtubers) just brush over, so thank you for being a part of the movement that normalizes this! Also part of me just wants to move to La and be your friend 😢 I feel like you need a good friend. I know living alone can be little debilitating just because we can easily allow ourselves to fall into ~that~ mindset. Have you considered moving into a new place with roommates?
We are your friends and feel how you feel. We care about you more then you know and love you. It’s heart breaking to see you go through this and be so sad. But things do get better even if it’s hard to see. Remember we’re here for you girl ❤️
Honestly if this whole video ain’t a mood. Girl so relatable!
love you morgy
GIRL THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS I RELATE SO HARD AND I NEEDDDDDD THIS. 💛💛😢
We are here for u Morgan ❤ 🌹 literally last week was an asshole to me too to be exact last two weeks literally on a mental health break now !!!
I feel less lonely today. I'm not alone in the struggle.
i dont know why but i can relate to Morgan, past week was probably the hardest.
❤️thank you for being brave enough to share, I feel like I have gone there x I love u unconditionally Morgan u r great x
Although everyone is telling you in the comments to move back to Colorado, personally I believe you won't truly be happy until you learn how to live with yourself and your thoughts. If you move back at this point you'll just use your family as a crutch and not necessarily face yourself.   You shouldn't "need" people around you to the extent to which you can't stay with yourself for a week in your house.   Check out healthy Gamer GG on Youtube here, he has a lot of conversations with content creators on youtube and twitch to which you might relate and be able to identify some tricks to help you cope with being alone.   Wish you best of luck!
You look GORGEOUS in the red dress. Omg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOOOOOTTTTTTT
Morgan you need to move back to Colorado. I feel like you’re so much happier there. LA is toxic and you deserve to be happy.
I want to buy like 80% of what you said no to!! What did you do with all of it?
Morgan to feel sad and anxious and excited for so many things at the same time and is so consuming but i really hope u find your passion, maybe decorating stores, houses, cars or making a clothing brand or being a dog mom, whatever it takes so that u are truly passionate about life and the future. Sometimes loving someone helps but being loved by yourself is even better, being proud of what u've done and achieved is an amazing feeling but we dont always recognize it cause we compare to others or feel less because our parents helped us when other people did it by themselves. I truly know in my heart that ur gonna get through this, and its gonna feel so good because we know the lowest and how hard is to overcome. Plus, u are such a beautiful, kind, shy and passionate person, we all love u. Family is always there to love us so if u need a little bit of comfort and love its okay to go with them, it doesnt make u codependent. We all just need love and give it too. Always here to listen and love u, heidy ;)
Who said it never works? I've literally loved you since I first knew you exist and loved you even more that I got to see you just be your authentic self. I know things are a bit hard with what's going on with shane but it has absolutely nothing to do with you and we all see it.  So please don't be hard on yourself, we absolutely love you.
Gosh, and let this be a really big reminder to live with empathy and be kind to others you interact with.   I'm sorry you went through this, I know you're saying your okay now, but still. Thanks for putting this out into the world to be seen and hopefully remind people that we all need to be kinder to each other, and ourselves.
Such a pretty soul inside and out. Praying for you!! You are so worthy and you are not alone! I know how exhausting being alive can be.
I'm so thankful for you Morgan and I'm so thankful for this vlog. You described exactly how I feel living with depression. Thank you for being brave, talking openly , and showing me I'm not alone. I love you so much Morgan! 💜
I prayed for you!!❤️ Jesus loves you, and if you’re reading this comment He loves you too!!🥰
I feel for you! I understood all your words deeply! ❤ BTW you are a great Cryer! Your cry is so pretty I look like I dying pig 🐖😭
I feel you hun. Everything you described how you feel is literally how I feel everyday. Some days are better than others. I am on meds though and I’m learning to just live day to day and not dwell on my past or stress about my future. Easier said than done but it is what it is. I hope you feel better soon and even though you might not think it but you’re very wise for your age. Love you and your family so much and know that your Stans understand and love you as well! Btw, you look gorgeous in Red 😍😘
Time to move on from L.A.!?! Maybe L.A. energy and your energy do not match.
I know the feeling you are going through. It gets better, just wait it out. Keeping myself busy with stuff helps, getting some sunshine helps too.
Even thought you had a bad week, this blog shows your strength because when you speak its about wanting to be better and live better in a sense of happiness and love for yourself. You are on your journey, you are blossoming and thats why its feel so new and difficult because you are figuring it out while going through it. Love ya Morgan. You are a true role model of mine 💕✨
Morgan your an incredible person! People are toxic they can be, My whole family except my dear dad god rest his soul, emotionally abused me my whole life, I tried and they just did it again,  they too were emotionally abused my mother by her mother an my brothers by my mother, and i am thier emotional doormat to the point where i do not want to live,, your not wrong for feeling this way
Oh Morgan❤️ You are the BEST person on this platform. The Youtube community doesn’t deserve you, you are so much better than all this.. Im the opposite, I love being alone, and hate socializing, it’s so hard.. I have no friends and Im not even sad about it.. I have a job that I love and a dog, a daughter that’s 18 (Im 34) and all I wanna do is to be at home or go to the woods.. I vote for you moving to Colorado, you seem the happiest with your family. And it doesn’t have to be forever. It’s worth it even if it’s just for the moment, a month or two, or a year❤️
Thank you for being so open and raw with us, it takes a lot.
I feel like everyone is going through this breakdown right now. I know I am!!!! We will persevere!!!!
I must exercise alone for the exact reason of your soul cycle experience
Love you so much Morgan 💖
Move to Colorodo!!!!!!
You're not alone... Feel the same 💙
Oof, when you said you’re afraid for the sun to set because that’s when you really feel it all. I felt that. I love you ❤️ proud of you
When I hear you speak it's like I hear myself speaking. I have a similar situation as you, I live far away from my family and friends and spend a lot of time alone. Now I have been home for like one month and when I got home again I felt also so alone and mainly at night, my heart just starts racing when it is time to go to bed.. the anxiety of waking up in the middle of the night and being all by myself. The emptiness you are talking about is also something I recognize. I think it are the following two things; a lack of God in my life and a lack of self-love. Personally, I think the two are related. By getting to know God, we get to know ourselves as I believe we are part of or have characteristics of God.   Oh well, a long ramble. I don't know if it will help you but I hope you feel better soon. I love your videos and honestly think you are amazing and I and many other people would be so happy to call you a friend.
Morgs, I feel this to my core. In the last 8 months, I’ve gone through so many significant changes and when I don’t feel numb, aloof or straight up catatonic, I feel like I’m barely staying afloat. But I’m choosing to get up everyday and at least try to find happiness. Also, we love an empathetic queen 🥰
We love you Morgan❤️ just remember that❤️
Wow thank you for sharing your lows this is so under rated. The more honest we are with our friends and followers then the more honest we can be with ourselves. You’re a legend. Keep on keeping on girl we got this!
Shane could never put this much emotion into any of his videos… ps Morgs Cherry Creek is calling your name.
Probably will get hate for this, but I went through the same empty feeling. I would be fine and then experience that sad hopeless feeling again. I know it's not PC or whatever but I am not kidding once I asked Jesus into my life and started talking to Him like a friend, that sad pit in my heart filled with love. I know it sounds so cliche but it's TRUE. He loves you so much that He died in your place on the cross, was buried and rose again on the third day. I pray you call out to Him, just ask Him if He's alive, you might just be surprised when He answers. 🙏💕😘
Thank you for your courage. We love you.
I’m sorry you’re hurting we ALL HURT 😔 the only way to get over the fear of being alone is to be alone. Get past the feeling of being scared, learn to love spending time with yourself and you will eventually love your “you time” 😊 you’re trying and it shows!!!! Queen
Hey babe, are you in therapy?
I have felt the same way for many years, you're  not alone.   But for me I needed to take out the toxic people that were draining me.    Let's be friends....❤
:(
Morgan you should think about making a Depop.
I hope you can find some meds that actually help 💗 I am still trying, myself
Morgan is my comfort person. ❤️
Thanks for existing! You just make this toxic Internet a better place! 🥰
Love to you, Morgan
I feel this so hardcore. I am 40 years old and I don't have that BFF that I do things with. The friends I do have, I never see. My Husband is my Best Friend but I miss having a gal-pal or a gay-pal 😆 to do 'girly' things with. And I have NO clue how to meet and make new friends. 😒
16:30 this is so relatable, that’s the exact same feeling I’ve been trying to explain for weeks, I feel less alone and more understood
Big love
My heart cracked when I saw you cry. But so thankful for you Morgan. You are a good person and you radiate such good energy. Take your time and take care of yourself. Love you ❤💞
Thank you for showing such vulnerable side of you here with us, I think theres def people that will relate to what you are going through and it will help them to feel less alone. We love u and appreciate you so much Morgan 🖤
Omg moral of the story don’t go to a workout that makes you feel like a bottom feeder wtf !!!
If anyone reads this it's okay not to feel okay. If anyone ever tells says you have to feel 100% , no you don't.  85% is fine!! 💛 Feeling 100% all the time is so unrealistic. You do you Morgan, we love your honesty 👏
crying on the floor then moving onto questioning your style choices is how i get through it too buddy
I was peeling a potato while watching this and the peel flew onto my phone screen and immediately changed the video 😭 just thought I’d share
You need a roommate as morgan. I hate being alone as well.
The video is so raw and real. This is 100% what depression is like. You're a beautiful human being and you are not alone, Morgan. We are all so proud of how far you've come and will continue to grow never forget that. Hang in there sweetheart this too shall pass. We love you <3
Everything in time❤️ You’ll be okay
I have never related more to someone when you mentioned that pit at night. I get it, I’m still working through those feelings/issues but I will get there and I believe you will too.
You’re so strong Morgan! A true inspiration🤍✨
Morgan ily so much you’re such a queen ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Morgan you're definitely not alone in how you feel. I have instances where I don't even feel like leaving my bed because I don't see a point to it even if I have something to do. It's not fun and I'm sorry you're feeling this way. Just know that you're very loved and I'm rooting for him all the way ❤
i really love how open you are on this part of your life even though it may not be easy to share. it helps me and others realize we arent so alone. we love you <3
I needed this video. I have had a rough few weeks myself! It is nice to know you are not alone. Thanks for being so open and vulnerable Morgan . Love you girl and you are amazing 💕
ITS OK TO NOT BE OK! ❤️ I LOVE YOU ALL
Fuck that soul cycle instructor
girl get our of LA
Morgan you are so real and relatable I breakdown every other month too life's hard but you are my favourite person
You crying in front of a mountain of clothes on your bed is literally me to a T.
It's funny how when we feel sad or depressed we dismiss those feelings by saying we are fine/okay or stupid/crazy. I think you've had some amazing growth Morgan! Keep moving through the motions, you'll learn what mental health tools help, what thinking traps like "always" are harmful, and what affirmations work for you! Some people don't get to that self awareness level. Be proud and know you aren't alone in these struggles! ❤🥰 Some days are just bad days and that's okay!
Me watching this because I just had a breakdown 🙃🙂🙃🙂🙂🙂🙂
I hope you get into therapy, I really think you need to talk about these things with professional that will listen to you. I feel exactly the same way and only professional help gave me hope. But it’s so sweet you’re showing that to people, because pretty much no one does. And even tho it’s sad to see you suffering, it’s nice to know I’m not alone in this ❤️ hopefully you find someone to work on that with, you’re such a nice person, you deserve that balanced happy life, you deserve to know why you feel like this and what you can do when you feel like this. 💕
We’re with you Morgan... I feel this on a whole other level, youre not alone
Not my first thought being that u should check out my pace by stray kids- This sounds bad but that song kinda helped me when I felt that way
Thank you for sharing Morgan, you sharing has helped many people already, I am sure of it. Side note, you look beautiful in that red dress! It's a wonderful shade of red on you! ❤
i love youuu 🥺❤️
hey! I love you!! I really needed to hear that cuz i had a very awful week. I wanna give you hugs Morgan. You always have brought smiles and positive light to my bad weeks. Just know that we love you!!
Morgan you’re literally so beautiful, your body is AMAZING, your curves are beautiful and all those pants look great on you 🤍
Thank you for showing this. Its important for everyone to know that others feel the same way. ❤
💖 you Morgan.  I have been and still am periodically where you are.  You are a beautiful person - please never forget that. Maybe move back to Colorado - you seemed pretty happy here.
Are you still friends with trinity? Not asking to be shady but you looked happy when you used to hang out with her
Morgan 💔I’m sorry you’re really going through it right now 😭 but I’m so proud of you for being so aware of your mental health and working really hard to think through/work through these things. You are doing amazing!
I kept tearing up during this one, I read this book about the law of attraction called “the secret” it’s really good about helping you to try be a more positive person. I’m very negative about myself and life and it’s helped me a lot. Always worth a try ❤️
Cried there with you. A lot of resemblance in what you said. Thank you. It's good to know we're not alone in this.
If you become a practicing counselor, you will be great. Sending good vibes ❤
I totally relate with this video. I have been feeling empty and dead inside. I just keep trying day by day because that's what you do and hope tomorrow is better.
Morgan of the past: I am not depressed...  Morgan today: i want to die LOL
Morgan thank you for being one of most authentic creators on this platform. Thank you so much for feeling comfortable with us as an audience to share🖤
when ur feeling down go for a walk it helps dear
You  hands down are the best! Keep on doing you! Thank u for  your vlogs
Have you considered volunteering? You sound lost. Sometimes being of service is the only way to gain perspective bc it forces you to think outside of yourself. Volunteering is also very rewarding.
Never forget that Jesus loves you! And He is there for you through these hard times! Praying for you 💓
I think you need to move somewhere less aggressive. I feel like LA is too harsh  and too much for your personality type. Not saying there’s anything wrong with that but you seem clearly happier when you’re near your parents/in Colorado. It doesn’t have to be forever.. you’re still very young and if you want to see ryland he’s only a plane ride away. It just doesn’t seem healthy for you to continue to live in LA... imo
jesus died for you to not feel empty. i love you morgan. listen to Elevation Church sermons by Steven Furtick. i think it will help truly
Thank you for sharing this raw and real moment with us... I know it will resonate with a lot of us, so thank you, truly. Love you & sending you positivity your way. ❤️
I lost the ability to walk this year. I was a normal girl then randomly lost the ability to walk and had to call off my wedding sell my dream home because the stairs and I wanted to die. I am just surviving right now. A depression I never knew. I totally relate to all of this. This was me before I fell into my real depression so I’m glad your doing things to counteract it.
Thanks for being you, feel you, hear you, and appreciate the content 🙏
Love this morgan!! Wish we could be friends!!
Morgan i totally get the mental war you go through. I feel the same way about where I currently live and I struggle with the same stuff. I love you and hope you keep going forward
Maybe a flat mate? Cookie is fabulous but it can be nice to have another person around!

I needed this video :(
You are a beautiful person inside & out. I've tried & swear by EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique - tapping) maybe it could help your journey too.
Realest person online-thank you Morgan for letting us know we’re not alone 💜
Even with a great life, a partner etc.  I TOTALLY RELATE!  I hear you and all I can see watching you is...you are such a beautiful normal human.  Hugs hun.
girl you need to get out of california and get a house near your friends and family! it’s not worth your mental health
Girl, I’m sorry you feel this way. The comments show that your not the only person who goes through this. Thank you for being so raw and showing us our feelings are valid and it’s okay to feel them. We love you and hope you get through this rough time❤️
This is literally me right now oml😂 i cant tell whether im laughing or crying most days
This was triggering but it helps to be self aware.
You're breaking my heart Morgan. I wanna give you a hug so bad. I know exactly how you feel. 💖💖💖💖💖💖
We love you!  I currently feel like my entire world is falling apart around me and this video gave me a little time to not think about it. Thank you!
how is your post manicure catastrophe doing??   i'm feeling like i'm in such a deep dark soul sucking black hole so it's nice to see someone else sob while they eat and know i'm not alone. i'm SO glad you're feeling better. sometimes you've just gotta fall apart ❤️
It sounds like high functioning depression
I can relate to "really bad week" but make it a year 💜, haha jokes, yes          Not really but that's okay 😊
Are you still playing animal crossing? You can make some new friends on acnh discord. Its good to chill out
I have these two friends from childhood who I would consider to be my best friends but time and time again I feel like they don't treat me in the way I treat them. It's hard feeling like I put more into relationships than I get back. I'm trying to learn to be my own best friend and it's the hardest thing I've ever done. Just gotta remember that I'm strong and what's ment to be for me will be. Happiness will always find me.
Speak up for yourself. I guess I'm old and don't take other people's shit anymore. I would have gone up to that Soul Cycle bitch and said,"this is very hard for me to even be here, DO NOT CALL ME NAMES!"
Morgan this actually helped me so much. I’m currently in college but I transferred here last year and I still haven’t been able to meet friends or anyone and it’s been really hard to be alone. But it’s also super confusing because I feel like I’m a good human being with good morals and values like I almost do too much for other people to the point where I end up getting used lol. but seeing you going through something similar is super helpful for me and I hope that we can get through this together!💜
this was needed
We’re here for you.
My wish for u is, I wish u could see urself through my eyes... U are so beautiful! But with that being said, I understand how u feel, for I too feel the same. Feel better soon💕
Awww Morgan I hate seeing you like this because I know you don’t deserve to feel like this! I lam manifesting/praying/ all of the things, that you will find peace with yourself, Although you may not feel like it, so many people are feeling the same way and almost everything you said was how I feel too, so I want you to know that you made someone else’s day better today!  ❤️❤️
not my place or business but you seemed much happier living in colorado. but i dont know you outside of YouTube, this is just an assumption.
Morgan thats part of 20s trying to figure out life... But still talk, expressing your felling is helpful
that class instructor sounds awful. I had a yoga instructor and he was amazing in terms of his talent, but he was also a bit cold personality wise. however, he was never mean. he would merely tap you to fix your form, but never called you out or made you feel bad about yourself. he also taught us to practice non judgement everyday, even if it's toward ourselves. his philosophies were really cool.
If this isn’t me I don’t know what is! I’d say it’s going to be okay but that hasn’t worked for me yet so... I wish I could figure out why I’m sad because everything is good ya know?! But I guess I should say keep at it!
This was so real and I relate to this so much its not funny or like trying to be like "Oh same!" no. This made me realize when someone says you're not alone you are not alone. This really helped me. Truly. Morgan you are a queen and I love you
It's so weird because myself and a few of the people I know are all going through this right now! Last week I stayed in bed and just cried. Just know that you are loved and it's nice to have someone that goes through what we do everyday
Morgan you are beautiful and so relatable. I hope you are having a better week. Also I totally went to DC site to browse, totally forgot about them but you could definitely bring them back. They need to give you a sponsorship 😊
I don't have friends either, but I do have Youtube. 😅😥
Sameee😭😭😭
I hate seeing you do this to yourself, just go back to Colorado, you aren’t LA Morgan, you can’t force it. You’re happier in Colorado and you’re forgetting that you can still make the same content there and it’ll by default be better because you’ll actually be happy again. These types of videos aren’t and have never been you, we love you for the person you are not this LA girl you’re trying to force yourself to be.
I am a baggy clothes person and I always love your baggy clothes! You should do a haul of all your baggy sweatshirts! I always love what you have on. 😊❤️
Idk why the mound of clothes reminds me of clueless 💜💜
Mogan, ive realized recently that in school they really should have dropped algebra, and all the stuff a "normal" person doesn't use in a day and they instead taught us how to be a functional person. How to do your taxes, how to cook for yourself and how to be self efficient.. why do I need to know what 3x7÷y=? Like I just need to know what blah+blah is!
We love you, Morgan!
omg I feel like I never and I mean never have I ever related to a video more
I had a mental breakdown last week after missing taking a dose of my meds. When that type of thing happens I become very self destructive (I once left my house at 11 pm just telling my mom I was going out, which was not normal, until 2-3 am. And didn’t contact anyone throughout). It’s been really hard to try to get back to a good place once mentally, and it helps a lot to see you, someone I adore and admire, going through something similar. Makes me feel less like a pos whose brain doesn’t work. Thank u.
I cried with you and I needed that. Morgan, your amazing. Thank you for this.
I'm so glad you talked about this because I've been feeling like this for my entire life and while I would never want anyone else to feel this way, I don't feel alone now. It was literally like you were speaking straight from my fucking brain!
Every time you started crying in this video, I just wanted to crawl through my screen to give you a big hug🖤, also you took my breath away in that red dress and white jacket, you’re absolutely beautiful and 100% smoking, love you and your videos Morgan
I took my like seventh mental health day today and I’ve only been working at my job for 6 months. I feel you. 😂😅
u better put ur clothes and glasses for sales cus I WANT
Morgan ur a amazing person and im sending u a ton of love virtually from India ,so when u recive it ull feel amazing 😂
I felt the same way when I was your age Morgan 😭😢
Me stopping my homework to watch morgan
i relate to this so hard. love you morgan. It really will be okay <3 i had to put up a sign that says "Everything is temporary" to remind myself that the current situation won't be forever. About to start a fantastic new job so it's finally turning around! <3
The depression and anxiety in this video 😢😶 Hope you are getting the help that you need 💕
I cried seeing this. Be strong. I say this coz I want to be the same as well. We will get there one day. Soon❤️
Sending you love&light Morgan ☀️
I feel this. Nothing is the same from two years ago I don’t have the same job, not the same friends, the boyfriend is gone. I’m completely different and LONELY. I realize that one day I will have everything I’d like and I will feel joy again. I haven’t met all the people I am going to love and are going to love me yet. I have so much sadness but so so so much excitement and joy to experience. I don’t have many or friends at all and that can feel MaMMOTH but I will get there and you will too. 💕💕
just started the video, me too sis
Morgan I wish we lived closer so we could be friends, and I could teach you how to take care of plants :)
Maybe there’s negative energy in your apartment? 💜
I had a breakdown with eggs this morning too :,)
The universe is telling you to go back home to Colorado babygirl💕
Sending good vibes :)
In all seriousness. When the US allows you to fly to the UK, come stay with me in the countryside xo
Love you Morgan. The amount of depression and negativity you express in all of your videos is very very concerning. I really hope it’s not as bad as it seems but if it truly is please seek real help. You’re so young, beautiful and intelligent you should be enjoying life way more than it seems you are. I would love to see you having fun, smiling, laughing and talking about positive things more often.
I'm just going to say separation anxiety really causes this feeling, moving back with your parents for a while helps. if you have a good relationship with them. but you're probably stronger then I am.  😂
Omg this how I feel every day 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 thank know I know that I’m not crazy ♥️♥️♥️♥️❤️😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Honestly! I feel the same. Emptiness and holding on on everything. Thank you for sharing this. It makes think about something. I hope it is because of lockdown.
Who else had a breakdown when Morgan was sitting on the floor crying cause I lost my shit 😭  You’re not alone girly! Keep doing you 💘
Morgan i just wanna hug you. You're such a beautiful human 💛 follow your heart my love.
Love you so much ❤️
I love you
Morgan we love you for you, not who you associate yourself with. Support your loved ones. Do what ya gotta do. We are here for you.
Wowww I appreciate you posting this video. I have been feeling this way and this was just so relatable. I hope there are better days and weeks to come for us! We got this. ❤️
Morgan, thank you for being brave enough to share your struggles. Be patient with yourself. I think it’s a lifelong journey toward balance. Your sensitivity and empathy is a gift. At least that’s what I tell myself on the days where I do/think exactly all the things you described :)
I'll be your friend ☺️😊☺️
Morgan, girl, thank you for showing this side of you and helping to stop the stigmatization of having bad weeks and bad mental health days. I know it’s so hard to be this vulnerable but it’s so nice to know that there are people who have these weeks just like me.
I don’t even know Morgan but I feel so incredibly protective over her. Like I need to be the one to tell her she’s worth it. Even if it’s every day or every hour. It’s crazy.
Much love to Morgan ♡♡♡
Morgan i think 40% of your issues went away if you stopped following and keeping up with "instagram models" you keep mentioning in almost every video of yours :/
Proud of you for trying and being so honest. You are not alone! So many of us feel the same way. You are so brave for sharing.
Morgan is all of us ❤❤❤❤❤
It helps so much, living through something similar at the moment. You’re not alone, love you ❤️
Morgan, I relate so much! And feel so similarly, and I just know the feeling...I also know that it may or not be helpful to know you are not alone with the way you feel but we have to push through and remember that things will get better, if we keep trying hard enough, this to shall pass, so cliché i know! We love you, your content, and continue to support a queen who keeps it real and 💯 ❤️
i cried watching this because i relate too hard. love you morgan
Morgan you are not alone!!! I grew up in a military family and change was required for me to survive. I went to 21 schools and lived all over the country. You cannot compare the place you’re in now to the place before. It will never be the same. You have to embrace it. And I get the friends thing! The amount of times I had to remake friends is insane. It’s ok girl, breakdowns are needed sometimes.
Bro this week has been awful. Last week was also not great. I feel like I keep going in this circle of feeling bad.. and then feeling bad for feeling bad.. and then feeling worse... and being okay for like 2 seconds before I am reminded of how much my brain sucks. And it's weird cause I was fine 2-3ish years ago, but now I can hardly function without getting stressed out or upset about legitimately everything.
This Video Is A Mood
You not being perfect and not trying to be perfect and let us see this parts. Makes you perfect to do this . We need more people like you in this world. Thanx for sharing this. Xxx
Those white shoes = hello Grandma
omg you need a poshmark or depop or something. I need some new clothes lol
I volunteer as tribute to accept everything you're getting rid of.............
Love you morgan! And Jesus does too!!!!
You are just absolutely beautiful inside and out and we honestly really appreciate the real content. We’ve all felt this way before. Love you and your channel 🌸💕💝
So proud of how far you’ve come💕 keep your head up!! We are here for you, love you Morgan! ☺️
This has also been one of the hardest weeks of my life mentally. The spring depression is so real 😫 thank you sm Morgan. All of the love ❤
Morgan, pain is growth. Embrace it, you are stronger than you realize.
ok but for real why is making friends SO HARD as an adult, I also loved some of these outfits the one at 11:09 I LOVE I wish i didnt look like a potato sack so I could pull something like that off
omg morgan i really hope you find happiness and peace, your soul is so beautiful we are proud of you girl you are very loved ❤️❤️❤️
Sees that you uploaded reads title & thinks to myself it’s only Monday this is so accurate 🥴
Just want to give you a hug, girl 💜
Aah Morgan, forgive me if my English isn’t very good. It isn’t my first language. But what you are saying right now, you are not alone. I want you to know that you are such a role model for me, a true inspiration. I hope you feel better soon! Wishing you all the love!!❤️
I love you, Morgan! I know exactly what you mean about feeling empty-I’ve been there girl. I do wish I could be your friend and be there for you during those times! 🖤
You’re amazing, definitely not alone, and I love you so much!!!💖 I’m going through it too boo😂😭
I feel you Morgan, thank you for being you and showing your emotional rollercoaster. I know it must have been scary to share but just know I really appreciate it, it makes me feel like I’m not the only one that has those days and that we will always get through them. ♥️♥️♥️
I live with my parents even though I’m getting way too close to thirty bc I CANT live alone, I WILL become a crazy cat lady hermit who kills herself at 35
Ever since Sarah Baska said she saw you at the hair salon on her podcast I’ve wanted to see you guys do a video together!
‘its not a breakdown its a breakthrough’ YES THIS IS THE ENERGY WE ALL NEED TO HAVE THANK YOU
I recommend doing Buti Yoga. It is both a great workout and helps you feel better spiritually and emotionally.
Morgan thank you for this video. Its crazy how much I relate with this video but its strangely comforting to know that someone out there is going through it too and kinda validate my feelings. Thank you for being so open and honest.
needed this 🤍
As someone with bipolar, I felt this so hard 💔
Hey love I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way specially when you know you’re doing everything you are supposed to be doing 💗 even though I know you’re not super religious but I believe you do believe in God since you mention him sometimes and ask for prayers even if it’s on a joking matter... just know that when we are getting our life together the enemy doesn’t like that, specially when he’s kept us in a state of depression for so long and then he sees we are trying to get better and actually doing it he gets mad and tries to keep us down however way he can. So don’t give up love I know our Lord is with you and he will guide you into the right direction 🙏🏽💗 I’ll be praying for you and just know that you are a very kind person who brings positivity to this dark world and the enemy doesn’t want that but you keep shining through ! ✨ so just stay strong and we appreciate this raw content of how life isn’t always perfect even though you try! 💗 we love youuu you’re amazing!
Love you, hope you feel better :)) Keep loving yourself girl, we're all really proud of you!
Love you Morgan 💕I’m so proud of you and you’ve come so far and your stronger then you give yourself credit for, I know how you feel I’ve been feeling pretty down to lately, I’m praying for you and well get through this together.💕
This was so heartbreakingly relatable! Morgan I am old enough to be your mum, I have kids older than you, and right now all I want to do is give you the biggest hug and tell you everything will be ok. I have struggled with depression and ptsd for many years, but I have never heard it explained the way you did, the fireworks in your stomach, being surrounded by so much love but yet feeling so lost and lonely. We get through the bad days because we have to, there is no other option. Just know that YOU are not alone. Keep talking, keep doing what you’re doing and make the most of the good days. Sending you so much love ❤️ xx
No ones life is perfect, that's just an unrealistic standard to put yourself up to. But I struggle with these thoughts too sometimes. Just remember, in somebody else's eyes, your life seems perfect. It's all a matter of perspective ❤️ you're great the way you are.
I thought I was completely alone in feeling this way. My best friend is getting married and I’m her maid of honor, my sister is pregnant, I just landed an awesome job surrounded by super supportive people, but I literally feel like I’m crumbling from the inside out. Like I’m on the verge of tears everyday. Thank you for being so open and honest about your mental health. This video is so much more important than you know! Sending you all of the love and serotonin. ❤️
Morgan I’m sure you will not see this but please know that I- we see you. We understand what you mean when you say your alone, hurting, an having a hard time with making friends and feeling good about yourself. I’m in the same way... I feel so lost and hurt with everything going on in the world and in life! It feels as if there is no end..... but please know you are not alone! I would love to be friends !! But that’s a stretch lol! I really am hoping you end up feeling alittle better from today on. Your a beautiful person inside and out! You are the one YouTuber I definitely relate to! Sending loads of love and hugs! 🥰🥰🥰🥰
You’re such an amazing person!! Be you!!
Soul Cycle sounds like torture! You couldn't pay me to go to a class. Morgan, you're brave as hell for that one ❤
Will you ship the sunglasses you didn't want to me??🤣🤣
It’s crazy how much I can relate to how you are feeling based on what you are putting out in your videos, here to say I love watching and I genuinely enjoy all of your videos & you aren’t alone.
You are the best Morgan ❤️ I send you all the love I can. I hope you feel better soon. You deserve it ❤️ the most caring, down to earth person in the internet
Awee🥺I remember days like these and definitely don’t miss them, I know they’ll always come and go but I remind myself that every time I will be stronger. I love that you know to find things that distract you, you’re on the right track! Never forget that you’re healthy, you’re family is alive, so take time to let go of everything else and appreciate what really matters! Sending love ❤️❤️❤️
Does anyone where her green sweater is from??
Morgan move baby girl, you need a fresh start ❤ I feel CA isn't you anymore of CO is where family and friends are then definitely give that a solid try. Live in CO vs dividing up your time.    I am 25 years old and unfortunately I have drifted away from my high school friends. COVID has made it far more difficult to meet girl friends. I tried Bumble for friendships but that SUCKED. People are more willing to meet for romantic meet up than a friendship meet up. I need to focus on getting myself back to school, you have definitely been a big inspiration towards that.
Girl you need to start a depop! I swear we have the same body type and I’m obsessed with your style. Would shop your closet so hard 😆
My mum is crying watching u cry, we love u so much and both of us know exactly how that feels. X
I don’t think you’re supposed to be in California girl
i hope you can find some peace of mind soon, but try to take it easy, literally everyone I know has been going through hell and life is just chaotic rn so don't put too much pressure on yourself trying to get it together. sending love from Argentina ily morgan :)
I really just want to hug her so badly and tell her that everything is going to be okay!
Thank you, Morgan.
I would take your own advice. The harder you push to be happy in a situation that your not supposed to be in, the harder its going to become. I know we only see a fraction into your life BUT from what ive seen you look a lot happier and healthier in Colorado.
"Should I put tiki torches in my room to feel something?..." Bruh. Same. Hahahaha, i love you Morgan <3
You're doing amazing and you are so loved and such a wonderful role model to younger girls.
You should fine a roommate! Someone to live with you or maybe move in with ryland and Shane. There’s nothing wrong with not wanting to be alone. Sometimes in life you want to be alone and sometimes in you need to be close with someone. Don’t feel bad about that. Embrace that. Do what makes you comfortable and slowly move yourself to discomfort
Love you Morgan! Hope things get better for you!❤️ It’s hard out here in these streets with mental illness 😩 Just had one of those days the other day😢
girl I felt the same when I lived in LA
Keep your head up Morgan!!! You are talented, smart, funny, dedicated, and an amazing person!! You have so much talent than you think you have. Never give up on your dreams in life. You got this💙💜
Literally felt every word you said in my soul. I'm fine, everything is fine, life is great, it's a beautiful day....but....its not. 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️☠😬
Girl I literally had the same meltdown a couple of weeks ago. I want you to know you are not alone. That goes for any other girl out there struggling.
"I Don't Know Why I'm Crying in the Club Right Now:  A Memoire" by Me.
Doing all the research you have, do you think you have codependent tendencies?? I know I do. I had a neighbor die yesterday morning, and it was unexpected. Now I am looking at my husband wondering if I am codependent on him and if I lost him today if I would be ok or not.
Dang man this video hit hard 😢 you are not alone!
This vlog is so relatable as I just got out of a low mental health period. Thank you for being so real and honest.
Morgan, you’re an amazing person. That was so wrong of that instructor to say to you that you are bottom feeder for not giving your energy away.  Your energy belongs to you and you shouldn’t be forced to let people feed off it.
Girl. Hold on to this; love you, love yourself, be happy for yourself, selfish, be happy, be at peace, be kind, be yourself, be careless and free 😊
Girl! You are literally the funniest woman on YouTube, everyone would love to be your friend!❤️
Why is crying while telling yourself everything in your life is fine, you’re fine, such a normal thing
Morgan babes.. we love you.. do me a solid.. crack open that bible and talk to God.. give it a shot ❤❤
I really wish we could have been friends at some point maybe....I honestly don’t know why I feel this way but after watching your vlogs, I always felt this way...I truly wish we were friends or someone like you maybe... Anyway, I hope you are doing okay, prayers for you💕
It’s been a really really messed up week seven days of torture, seven days of bitter and my girlfriend went and cheated on me she’s a California dime but it’s time for me to quit her lalala whatever lalala it doesn’t matter            What is this from lol!!!!!
Can you please stop being the same person as me? 😂😂😂
Transformative Heartbreak makes a sick band name.
YouTube community needed this raw and unfiltered footage. It is so honest, brave, and beautiful. Thank you for posting this. Hang in there Morgan! 🥰
When I was about to turn 23 I had to move back home, and I had deeper depression than I realized... it turned into a full-blown quarter life crisis. I basically had nothing left but my family, and had to rebuild my life from the ground up as well as seek medical and psychological help. And now 5 years later my life is so much better and richer, after taking care of myself and figuring out which things really mattered to me. It's okay to fall apart if it means rebuilding to something better! And you're probably tired of internet strangers saying this, but I really think you should move back to Colorado. It doesn't have to be in your family's house, but no shame if it is! You worked hard for that room!
GODDDD I felt this so hard. Lookin cute, with your tea and your amazing breakfast, trying to use techniques that have worked in the past to help you feel better (manifesting!! feeding urself!! drinking water and tea!! "everything will be okay!!") and just breaking down bc that's all you can do at that moment. Crying can be such a good thing for us. I've been crying on and off all week. Work stresses and anxiety and a break up. This crappy feeling is temporary. It IS going to be okay <3
Girl, get tf back to Colorado
is Morgan still friends with Trinity?
I think this video is so important because you’re fine one minute and then sometimes for no reason at all, you’re not the next. We think outside things will “fix” us (relationships, food, money, etc) but they don’t. I love that you did this. I feel this 100%.
I know she doesnt love hugs but I want to give Morgan a hug throughout this whole video, we love you girl and your not a bottom feeder lmao
I feel this way soo often. I would also like to assure you that you are doing great. You are touching people on a Global level. Maltese (Country in the EU)  person here, and I genuinely believe you are brilliant.
I'm sending all the best, positive, good vibes your way, Morgan. 🙏🏼 Everything is going to work out. Don't feel bad for having those thoughts and feelings, let it all out, talk it out with your loved ones and your therapist. Don't worry about YT or vlogging, your mental health and well being comes first always, girl. 🙏🏼❤
don’t try for other people try for YOU ❤️ Learning to be your own best friend is beautiful yet the hardest thing i’ve ever had to do!! Love you Morgan. You’re a strong soul and all you have to do is step into that :)
i love how real and vulnerable this video is, very relatable for anyone watching. you’re amazing Morgan! 🤍
i swear i’m like right where you are 😭😭😭 brb need to collect myself before i go back to my desk. stay strong morgan ❤️
Honestly part of my therapy for the week is watching your videos and getting serotonin from coffee so. Idk if you needed that but I felt like I needed to say it lol
we may or my not have the same type of mind tbh lol watching this made me feel like I was watching my besties or myself vent to our snap chat group chat 😂 you would fit right in with us!
I can't tell you how excited I get to see a notification from your channel 🥺🥺 I wish someone brings you the happiness and positivity you bring to the people around you ♥️♥️♥️
Oh honey. You are a good person. Lift your best life. You are amazing!!! Cookie is adorable . Take care Morgan . You deserve the best.💖
DC Shoes will never be gone for me 🙃
You look so pretty during your breakdowns what the heck I look legit HOMELY during mine wow
HONEY! I know you were going through it- but- can I just say...you look GORGEOUS!! The red dress is PERFECTION on you....You looked just amazing! LOVE YOUUUUU!!! <3
dang we probably cried at the same exact time and didn't even know it
This is such an important video. Thank you for expressing not only your feelings but mine too. It’s hard. Go where you’re happy 😊🤘🏻🖤
❤❤❤❤❤❤ you're amazing Morgan. I love your content and I really enjoyed the decluttering 😊 I too suffer with depression and anxiety especially at bedtime I get vicious anxiety attacks where my chest is pounding 😑 just gotta take it one day at a time. I think it's really great that you're getting better by doing things during the day instead of laying down.
morgan i love you so much and so many other people do as well. always remember that🤍
The California you vs the Colorado you is so different. You seemed so happy at home with your family. I'm hoping you move back soon! Wishing you the best!
You look amazing in the red dress!!!
I adore you.
You’re too hard on yourself girl, take a break and chill out 😊 thanks for still posting and btw you look bomb
Thank you so much for posting this video. Everything you said i feel too and i am trying to get better too but slow steps slow steps :) this past years especially last year and now  I fell like everything is diffrent friends are on diffrent stade of their lives and i am feeling lika a total let down ....
Girl I’m in the same place. I love you, we can do it! Keep your head up Queen💜✨
I feel like we are going through the same thing, I am on the search for new friends 👀
Thank you sooo much morgan for being soo authentic and showing such a raw and personal side of you !!!!!
I needed this today, because I have been feeling the same way. So thank you Morgan for being so honest 🤍
I would recommend listening to The Voices in Our Head a podcast by Krystyna Hutchinson - she’s a New York comedian on a journey~~ and exploring the fun of life. It helps me get out of my funk
Me crying while watching Morgan cause I can relate so much 😔😶
Had an absolute break down last week. Needed this...
Minimalism has saved my life for sure!
So many hugs Morgan I’m glad to see that you pulled through from someone that spent years on running away from their problems and bearing their childhood traumas for years and years and years you have to feel those feelings still keep on getting bottled up and that’s not good for anybody feel those feelings girl You’ll feel better afterwards watch a movie cry it out for holding on to people I do this too we’re all human you may be an optimist and what that does is it makes you want to see the good in people even if they are completes A-hole that does not make you a bad person does not make you a stupid person And makes you empathetic but you will discover the line that you need to have when you’re ready
Morgan, you’re right. You look so cute in that red dress ❤️
Maybe you need to volunteer somewhere 💜 to put that energy somewhere else. I  Sorry you feel this way Beautiful💜
Sending you so much love. Remember you are funny you are kind you are pretty you are self sufficient and strong. Xxxxxx🇬🇧 Penny xxxx
Same. All you can do is stay positive.
Morgan that red dress with the white jacket.... wow you’re so stunning and you don’t even know it! <3333 We are all so proud of you for being strong and pushing through the bad days. Keep surrounding yourself with the people who make you feel whole and you will figure it out. Pushing your boundaries and forcing yourself to do things that make you feel uncomfortable for self growth purposes will help you in the end<3 you’re totally right this is a breakthrough not a breakdown!
I relate to this sooooooo hardddddd 🖤🖤🖤🖤 I love you Morgan, sending you so much love and all the good vibes ✨ we’ve never met but I fully think of you as my internet friend 🖤🖤🖤🖤
morgan i love u so much i look up to you like a sister
Okay is it just me but when Morgan sat down with her breakfast my first thought was "Oh my gosh...even though she just worked out she looks so, so beautiful and so strong and I just want her to be happy"
SENDING YOU THE BIGGEST HUG (even if you don't like physical touch haha)❤️
Listen to your inner voice about people.  There ARE VERY TOXIC ones out there!!
We love you Morgan 🥺💕💕
I told you were best friends. Ur not alone im in the exact same situation you are in only im in Austin and i have no family here. Its hard to make friend im alone ALL of the time I get no texts ok may be by 1 person and my mom is my best friend but shes in el paso tx 8hrs away moving back aint easy cus of my job and I like what i do alot. Ok im going to stop lol I don't know if you'll even read this but ive been learning alot of self love shit that in just done now and want to make friends but its so hard im very social I'm nice but im so anti social. But we think alike alot I watch ur videos on repeat EVERYDAY! Love you so much friend. I hope we talk one of these days.
You totally should’ve got a couple succulents from Home Depot! They require soooo little attention that it’s ALMOST impossible to kill them!
I really appreciate your honesty in this video, I think this video will help many others who may also be feeling the same way. You are STRONG :) x
Love you Morgan 💗💗
YOU ARE NOT A BOTTOM FEEDER.  A lot of us are introverted and appreciate like-minded people. People are allowed to be a mess as long as we have the ability to look back at ourselves and change. Self-awareness is our gift.  People are toxic when they refuse to acknowledge and change their trauma.
That soul cycle class sounds like THE worst thing for anyone's mental well being like how on earth is being judged and screamed at supposed to uplift you yikes. Also I'm glad you're doing better now, sending you lots of love <3
Morgannnn fuck I wish we could talk. Lol I feel you on so many levels 😂 you’re the best friend we all need but are too awkward and not social enough to find
Awesome job morgan
This was like a punch in the gut.
omg morgan i've been a mess recently, u, garrett and andrews podcast and american horror story are the only things keeping me going
"It's not a breakdown, it's a breakthrough" I will be living by this forever now  We love you Morgan 🖤
Thanks a lot Morgan for providing us with content while going through this we are here for you
I wanna be friends with Morgan
MORGAN!! Girl try to find a safe way to be friends with your fans!!! Do meet and greets girl!!!
Oh my goodness, you couldn't pay me enough to live through my 20's again. It gets better 💕
"Jeans that I've been waiting to fit for two years that just haven't fit." This is so freaking real. I'll be right back and dump my closet into a donation bag.
I love your point that everyone is good but they could have unhealed parts of them. You’re so amazing I hope you know a lot of people deal with this! Your videos genuinely make my day better 💜
I love you so much!!!!!!
Honestly, I've had a bad year 💀✋🏽
Life do be hard man. You’re hitting close to home
I hate to say it Morg but I think you should move back to Colorado you are happy there and at peace you can tell <3
Love ya, stay strong
Life is a bitch, I only say that because life is testing me. I had to find my family a new home my landlord sold the house I was renting. I 4 kids and think I'm pregnant even though on the bc no room in my truck for another kid.. 🤯🤠 So we can get through this together. Life is a Rollercoaster ride.
We love u 💚💚💚💚💚💚💜💜💜
Omg, this "bottom feeder" cycling lady has this kind of mentality that idealise toxic masculinity and push it onto everyone (regardless of gender)...   Like: "if you're not agressif, you're weak". Truth is, being aggressif for no reasons show how insecure you really are because actually strong people have nothing to prove to themselves or others, secure people don't feel the need to bring others down to feel better about themselves. She is a yapping chiwawa with a superiority complex. Real strength is embrassing your feelings and admitting your vulberabilities and moving through them to help yourself and help others.
🤍🖤
all my love to you ms morgan. you deserve the best 💕
This shit really hits home. I hope shit gets better for you Morgan
i love youuu morgan💗💗
Leave Los Angeles Morgan, you in LA vs you in Colorado are two completely different people (at least on the blogs obviously I don’t know you in RL)
I love how Morgan makes some of her videos very personal and doesn’t fake anything in front of the camera, love you Morgan 💖
Your not a bottom feeder. Forget her 🤣 we love you 💗
🤍🖤
Love you so much Morgan ❤️❤️❤️
It’s not a bottom feeder if you don’t follow their directive it’s quite opposite...., I would want to shout “I’m not a lemming!” I hate feeling forced to act or be something I’m not,  against the fiber of my being:-) You are a beautiful soul, you do you:-)
Awwww Morgan ❤️ I’m sorry your feeling like this. Take deep breaths and cuddle that cute fricken cat!!!
I literally checked your channel for a new video just before you posted.
Love you so much Morgan ❤️❤️❤️
Love you so much Morgan ❤️❤️❤️
I just got up from my depression nap, today is so hard...
Best rule of thumb for decision making is if it isn't a enthusiastic hell yes then it's a hell nah.
14:50 there's a seinfeld episode for that - having a pool in your room 🙃
Thank you for sharing ur ups and downs! It must be very difficult to post this and i wanna thank you for that! Also if u wanna be friends hmu sis 💕💛
Can we please get “I’m not a bottom-feeder, I’m just shy” merch
BOTTOM FEEDER?! WTFFF... I myself am a hard ass....I can look at someone sometimes and wonder why they are being like that... then i have to realize dude... i just went to the doctor last week because i feel like i wanna like crawl out of my body and do like acrobatics , and she talked to me for an hour and i told her at least once a month i do this thing where i go into a complete like.....for me ill call it self loathing... and where  I  cant stop thinking about how i could have done this and that better . i could have kept my family(mom and dad) together and if i would have done this and that maybe this would change (PMS IS REAL) ...they said i should skip the white pills of my birth control  HORMONES ARE REAL... not saying that is whats happening but like yo.... our bodies to crazy shit....... ....Eating like a meal when your about to cry is hard... and eating is fucking so healthy... for mental health especially some days im being such a crabby person and just  confused but all i need is a good meal to make me feel better and to this day i forget that sometimes!!!
Much love morg 🥺🤍🤍🤍
Morgan, I really do think u should move back to Colorado. La is just so toxic-
ur videos make me feel like we’re on ft
Morgan I feel like you are challenging yourself to stay in LA even though it’s making you miserable JUST because you want to prove a point to yourself and to others and show that you can stay in a place for a longer time than usual. I’m sure you can do so but I really don’t think LA is the place for that. I hope in the end you pick whatever makes you happy🤍
You do put energy into the world I’m sure you’re a delight to be around. You just gotta keep your head up I know its hard to make friends. I can relate with being socially awkward and the pandemic happening I’ve been more alone then ever before.
Is it just me or did she try the same pair of sunglasses on like five times 🤣
Morgan, we love you so much! Whatever you choose to do for you, we're here for you always! 🤍🤎🙏
I needed this. Thanks
Hi morgan, can you try the philippines pancit canton instant noodles sweet and spicy. thx
I have like one week a month where my anxiety throws me out of my normalcy 😬
Must be something going around. Last two weeks have been the worst of my life. My.Mom is unresponsive in the hospital for two weeks and they still don't know what's wrong with her. Car trouble and they won't let us see her. My sister has given away her cats. I'm in a different state. I cannot deal. ❤️ Thank you for sharing. Gives me something to watch.
Please send me your sunglasses😭
I think you need to move back to Colorado for your mental health 💜
Love you Morgan✨💖✨
I haven’t even watched this yet but I love that Morgan’s channel is legit just doing her absolute best until her next breakdown...SAME SIS SAME
Maybe LA isn’t for you. That’s okay it doesn’t have to be for everyone.
my week is already bad, and it's only Monday morning
"Well on my way to a tearfilled day" needs to be on some merch.
I will totally be your friend you have such a beautiful soul an ik the feeling going thru alot myself
people who need to namecall to "motivate" people are just shit at teaching
I wish we could have a meetup and show Morgan just how many people love and support her for who she is (the real her) and that she doesn't need to put on a happy face for us. We love you Morgan!!
Come back to Colorado ❤💙
Can you do a skincare routine or products you use video??
Literally this breakdown was me two weeks ago and I thought my entire life was over and now I’m looking back at myself like wow she was fine and needed to breath
Love you Morgan! 🤗 Aaand also I can totally relate to your situation!!
I learned in my 30's its not selfish to not give strangers my energy. Its just smart. There are about 15 people on this planet I willingly put my energy into. If that makes me a bottom feeder than * sloomthch slooomtch sloomtch * I'm just nomming away down here having the best version of me available for the people I actually care about. Are you my child? Married to me? Do we share a first string blood tie or do you share one with my husband? Are you my best friend or her immediate family? No? Then I'm probably not wasting my energy on you.   And you know what? Thats fine. The majority of the world does not care about us. Its why its important to save our energy for OUR world and the people who really matter.   I'm not cheering for anyone but my children in an athletic setting. Ever.
yup ^^ exactly how i feel this week
hi morgan (: i have been sending you little instagram updates for about over a year now, hoping some day you’ll seem them. i love you forever. also my insta username is bella.auclaire
Love you Morgan!!!! March was a mental health struggle for me. I’m starting to mourn my previous life too.
Your vulnerability and honesty is inspiring and so so needed! 💕
Buy Bitcoin.
💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
we are proud of you Morgan <3 ily and how far you’ve come :)
Do you have a therapist?
The fact that her mom's gonna watch this Also I know who's the boyfriend's gonna be 😂🤣
I love how she’s over here crying and there is elevator music in the background 😂 but Morgan even if you don’t feel loved we love you just know that 😊
I love you too morgan ! I am 25 and live in ohio lol I look forward to your videos and I just want you to know that im so proud of you and how you're growing and evolving but also please know you are not alone and thank you for truly being yourself and raw and real 💖 you and I seem to keep going through the same kinds of things at the same time and its odd but I appreciate you because you're soooooo not alone
So much love and happiness from me to you! when i wanna feel better i go for a trash walk. Bring a picker and a bag. see what you can do for the earth and yourself!!
So relatable .... up and down and all around and its totally normal ! ❤️
💖💖💖💖💖
Morgan- society is going through this. Look what the world has faced in the last year and a half. Covid told us we were to become recluse and we were going to fucking like it. But we are naturally social individuals. And now things are slowly getting back to a more “normal” state and it’s like a culture shock all over again. For me, I realized I was filling my life with really shallow and stupid shit. And when covid happened, a bandaid was ripped off. And it hurt. Then I realized, I didn’t need that meaningless bs in my life. And I realized I was doing things that essentially further self-sabotaged myself. Like, I went to art school, got chronically ill, had a pity party, decided art wasn’t for me bc I was sick. And then did everything I could to deflect. Covid made me realize what was really important to me. Made me realize to stop being a little bitch, and confront what made me insecure about fulfilling my dreams of being an entrepreneur and artist. And now that’s what I’m doing, and I have purpose to get out of bed every day.   I also think your loved ones are going through a lot of growing pains and drama as well, and naturally, when you love someone, their pain becomes your pain, too. I won’t speak on those individuals bc I have some real thoughts. But im here to talk to YOU! Girly. Lol. So anyway, I just hope you give yourself a break. I hope you really see we all are going through it, for personal reasons, and for reasons we had no choice of being in. Hang in there!!
Ugh I wish so badly I could just give you a hug and talk so you you are amazing Morgan and you need to know this we love you and I know you know this it wil get better change is scary but it’s good I promise you ❤️ feel better and remember I matter
*The Queen has returned.* 💖
QUEEN
i am so MF GLAD that you posted this
Sending lots of love to everyone that is hitting a low right now 💕
People are so negative these days like if you don't have anything nice to say don't say it. That lady just ruined her day.
thank you for this video ily
Morgan is such a beautiful person, she is so me, hang in their Morgan it will get better take it one day @ a time
❤️❤️❤️❤️
9:07 🥺 i love you baby
Dude... when I’m at 85% okay I feel like I’m thriving. You’re all doing great! Keep on survivin!!
Morgan no matter what happens we all love you so much. If you ever need anything let us know! I think you and Trinity should go on another roundtrip 😂 you two look like you're having so much fun together.😊👍
This video is me one week out of every month 😂 Morgan, most of us can relate. I hope you find happiness more frequently soon. Don’t be so hard on yourself! 💗
Just ✨wait a few days✨
I needed this <3
2-week hiatus is a lot? GURLL we've waiting almost a year for Shane to post! 😆
We love you Mo❤️
This breaks my heart, especially because I’m sure she’s having hard time keeping positive, genuine relationships + especially now since all the -stuff- that has happened with people she’s intertwined with it surely has probably negatively effected her as well - when she definitely doesn’t deserve the heat of others actions. Praying for you Morgan 💕💕
we love u and your videos!~
Is it weird to say that a dog might help with the loneliness? 😊 it certainly helped for me.
Same baby same
That's me
I relate so much to you it’s insane 😂💗 bottom feeder vibes ✌🏻
You should move back to Colorado!!! I think it would be way more beneficial for your mental health and happiness! Of course that is completely up to you but I think that we all have been able to see a difference between Colorado Morgan and L.A. Morgan. We don’t know you personally and don’t see day to day life but we want what’s best for you!! ❤️
Seeing you hurting makes me so sad. Sending love and strength
Just get a roommate.  Then you won't be alone.
Aw Morgan, I would NEVER call you a bottom feeder!
Morgan crying over eggs telling herself everything will be okay is literally me and I feel that.   Also thx for the great content :)
Thank you so much, I needed this. I've been struggling mentally alot and you always help to make it bit better 💕
love morgan your an amazing youtuber who tells us the news as it is thank you for beinf honest. BYEEEEEEE
Dropped everything for this
You look so good!! Smile babe!
Okay long-haired Kween Morgan 🙌🏻 Love to see it ❤️
Stay beautiful sis 🙌🙌🌺
You don´t have to do whathever people tell you to do, if you want to scream, do it, if you don´t, it´s ok. IT´S OK TO BE YOURSELF!! ♥♥
Yes go straight to the back. Like you not about to point me out
i had the worst month of my life (march) morgan ur not alone
Oh my gosh, I love you Morgan. I'm sorry you're having a hard time.
We all cry into our eggs some mornings.
It's ok to not be ok and we are always here for you ❤
I LOVE YOU MORGAN! take care of yourself girl x
Oh my god when exercise class teachers call me out or even insinuate that I'm not doing my best, once class is over I go home and cry. NOT INSPIRATIONAL lol I had a pilates teacher call me out for shaking while planking and I've been different ever since
Hi Morgan! Just wanted you to know that your videos always make my day. Thank you so much! Lots of love from France :)
Me - trying to study for tomorrow's test Morgan - **uploads a new video**

Sending love to you Morgan you’re so unique and real ... from Canada 🇨🇦 come here we will take care of you xoxo
Heeey Morgan just a reminder that you created that vlog channel just because you wanted to have fun on YouTube again. So if you don't want to vlog nobody will be mad ❤️

It's all good Morgan you're still a bad bitch🔥💃🏽🥰
Morgan is so relatable. I feel like I'm not alone when I watch her videos. It's somehow comforting to know that someone feels the same way you do.💖
At this point I feel like we’re all the same person 😂😭
I hope next week is better for you :)
Morgan I hope you will be better soon ♥️ we all have bad days, weeks or months
Don’t worry I’ve had multiple break downs within the last 5/6 months. Because of stress and my anxiety. I’ve done nothing but sleep.
I can 100% relate I literally just had a breakdown today out of nowhere
You're doing great 🥺💘 happy late easter and happy late birthday to me 🎉
