He so NICK MINAJ SOOO TAJ MAHAL IN INDIA..  ...OOOOHAAAA
NICKI MINAJ IMPERSION IS SPOT ON
I love e them ❤❤❤❤
Because she doesn’t take herself seriously, it makes her endearing. Brilliant personality. that award where they all stood together, is actually a better way to do the nominations all the women getting up on stage made me smile so so so hard  My favorite thing about this is how easy she made it for other women to be silly and goofy at that moment. So freaking cute. gets more beautiful with age. Amazing woman. “Girls?” Anyway, I love all of these women.  Have watched them for years, and love their work! She made a lot of good parks I love her so much she is so freaking hilarious I didn't realize she did stuff like this at award shows haha this randomly popped up on my feed. Her getting up on stage during nominations though, what a LEGEND, I wonder if the organizers knew she would do that or she just did it and was like, do it then apologize later (they run a tight ship at these awards) GOD BLESS EVERYONE AND EVERYONE'S FAMILIES! A great idol for women in comedy Famous folk are always rushed and out of breath lol she’s amazing god I wanted that to go on longer Hey, they weren’t done... I want them to do this every time let’s celebrate everyone  Don't be suspicious, don't be suspicious! Don't be suspicious, don't be suspicious! Don't be suspicious! Don't be suspicious!  this is the best compilation!?!!! She's charming. GOD BLESS EVERYONE AND EVERYONE'S FAMILIES! A great idol for women in comedy Famous folk are always being rushed and out of breath lol she’s amazing She’s too funny. She’s awesome Her first Globes win is so iconic to me because everything she did point to «I know im not winning » and then she won and was gagged  "I hold your boobs while you talk."  LOL!  Been there!  LOL! Hahaha, massaging her back holy shit hahaha I was there in person as the studio audience yesterday. She's super cool, professional, and fun off the camera. Stoked for her new album! Honestly, a male/female late-night duo talk show isn't such a bad idea. I've never been fond of the daytime version, but putting it after the Watershed could really make it work. I was there in person as the studio audience yesterday. 3.2K Honestly, a male/female late-night duo talk show isn't such a bad idea. I've never been fond of the daytime version, but putting it after the Watershed could really make it work. Loving her goofiness, she’s so vibrant and happy. She’s in such a good place now. A happy era for the QUEEN This woman is timeless, she looks the exact same as 10 years ago I couldn’t even tell she was a guest. She owned it like she’s been on the show as a co-host.  I can tell she really loves acting a lotta people don’t know that she actually was passionate about acting i think continuing her acting career will be so interesting. Love this side of Nicki, so glad she's back in her zone. She did so well everything was natural and not forced, she’s officially back!  This was so much better than it had any business being. Nicki is funny. I would definitely watch her show she could name it “Nicki at Night “ We need you She’s glowing! Motherhood did her good. It seems to have grounded her and made her more relaxed and down to earth. I like this Nicki! James is not good at roasting each other is everything I needed in life  She hosts the show like a pro NICKI LOOKS SO COMFORTABLE HERE! I AM SO HAPPY THAT SHE'S ALSO HAPPY Nicki needs her own show or to continue to host shows because her personality is literally a NATURAL for TV. Love her! Nicki needs her own show. Also, her facial expressions are funny The Queen has returned to once again bless us with her iconic, bubbly personality, her presence, and of course, more music! AND WE HERE FOR IT! at the moment. everything we wanted. THIS NICKI ERA will never be topped, she’s coming FULL SPEED  icon and LATE LATE SHOW HOST Crazy how Nicki just fits right in like it wasn’t even awkward to watch like she belongs there she’s so entertaining I love her She NEEDS TO HAVE HER OWN SHOW. Love Her voice The girls are SHOOK!!! The Queen is back in full force. Nicki was so comfortable and in her element. LOVE  She's an icon, she's a legend, and she is the moment. Cmon now! accents,… with a splash of eye-roll side-eye. Lol. She was great. Totally hilarious. I can't wait to see more of her talents unfold! She's great at television! I’m very impressed with how natural and perfect her comedic timing is. It was such a joy to watch this! Thoroughly enjoyed this... James matches everyone's energy Her doing the desk magic felt like Moment 4 Time Life  I seriously think she's is not first a singer and secondly, she's a comedian. She is so funny!! it's so entertaining to see her do this! She's a ball of energy & good vibes. Totally born for this I was smiling all through the video I have seen another singer last night was not good was not in my own age It's was talking my ear off so My Own Bother are crazy name by James Corden was the worst singer QUEEN missed her on TV.. feels like old times I’m not gone lie she is growing on me. She did real good and her new song with Lil Baby is  I love her new style  Honestly, you can’t but love her!! “I don’t talk about money” LOL Oh my goodness, I have not laughed out loud so hard in years, you two are so perfect together, it is good chemistry. is the cutest person. So awesome people. I laughed and cried during this entire interview. The drought is over Nicki looks BOMB as always, love seeing her on tonight!  She is completely in the element!  Nicki's breaking out! This was a lot of fun! Nicki was entertaining! This woman needs her own talk show Lol, I want more Nicki on my TV screen.

She should have her own show
Honestly, I've always thought N Minaj was okay (music & movies). But now that I've seen few interviews SHE's funny but fits in & not forced or phony👌👌.
damn shes fine af.
Nicki is the best and all that, but can someone please explain the absolute wizardry of when she spawned that table in front of a live audience??? I cannot wrap my head around that
NICKI
who else is watching this after the queen died
Oh my goodness, I have not laughed out loud so hard in years, you two are so perfect together, it is good chemistry. Nicki really is the cutest person. So awesome people. Love you both so much.
I love Nicki on this show. She should get it, for sure.

Not me get this on my recommendation after the queen is gone
Not me watching this now and she just passed away 😪🙏🏽
well this didnt age well
Even though this was like seven months ago, Queen Elizabeth was brought up in this video, and before she passed, which was literally this month seven months ago, she was important six months ago. She was probably sipping tea with her husband
Nicki needs a talk show plz😭❤️❤️
He's hiding peppermint schnapps
Seems like trump has them traumatised  😀
I Enjoyed EVERY moment!!! NIcki is just great at everything she does!!
I like Nicki’s face expressions and the way she rolls her eyes.

I hope we can have Late Late Nicki show in the future.

It's the audience pretending to see the special effects *que the laughter.
Good morning Oprah Show.  Nicki Minaj.  I'm outside on cardboard boxes.  Please relate my message to Ms. Knowles.  Beyonce I'm sure your involved in what's going on with me on the island of Jamaica from 2015 JANUARY till today July 2022.  Beyonce do you read my mind prior to writing you?.  Or do the people who have their microchips inside my body and tell you what I'm thinking.  To justify what they have done to me to cover it up?.  Or is it my family who's in contact with you who may have turned BAPHOMET members?.  I live on the streets for nearly 7yrs I'm either being punished to become a BAPHOMET member.  • Or I'm being punished because of what the demons are telling the government and it's people how to treat me.  Or because of police investigation to cause me to show in my mind that I have killed or molested kids.  Which I have absolutely never done anything like that God is my witness.   They can't put me into prison it may have up-setted them.  Then there's an incident I bumped into a girl on the JUTC bus october 2010 and discharged in my institutional federal clothes.  I didn't plan for it to happen it was an accident.  I didn't know at that time I were carrying a microchip but I'm told that the microchip showed what happened on the bus.  I did wonder if the people on the bus smelt my sperm before hearing that there was police officers including the girl and my aunty working with the police which is why we took that bus.  Because I were under criminal investigation in America that continued the investigation at Jamaica from that time 2010 October till today July 2022.  I've heard that my aunty gave the girl my clothes to put a voodoo spell on me which almost crippled me in my aunty house I was attacked by an entity.  Thank God I was delivered.  I've heard since the girl and her family etc took matters in their hands to repay me and even had me robbed and cut they can't sue me or put me into jail.   I'm wondering if that's one of the reasons why I'm held against my will till money is given to the girl because of my success or till something criminal comes up?.  My daughter was taken from me I've heard different reasons the girl on the bus is one of those reasons.  The other for BAPHOMET reasons/ my BABYMOTHER took ATARAH because I was going to be extradited to the USA for lying to the government which I didn't plan on lying it just happened.  Then I've heard that superintendent of police Tony Hewitt had them take my daughter to frustrate me for criminal investigation to read my mind from the microchip or for I to do something crazy to get into trouble.  Beyonce after seeing Fifty Cent on the tv inside the hotel room 2014 December a direct message to me at OCHO RIOS.  I couldn't hear him I only heard "he didn't say anything then and he ain't saying anything now".  I saw Fifty at Rikers 1995.  I went to Melody for Christmas dinner from OCHO RIOS following the instructions of my mother in America.  At Melody table I was given something to eat that felt like I took in acid that went on the left side of chest twice it happened.  I died for a few minutes ATARAH was in my hands I gave her two small piece of what I ate.  I'm told it didn't hurt her because she was too young 1+.  I left Melody was sent back to the hotel the following morning I saw Funk Master Flex driving pass Sophia store he troubled troubled.  I've also heard that the girl had me eat the food to lock down my organs which feels like they are glued together.  Portia SIMPSON MILLER may have helped the girl and was looking to use me for demonic purposes.  Did Fifty Cent/ funk Master Flex/ Portia SIMPSON MILLER put in another microchip 2015 January to see the damage done to my organs to protect herself etc from going to jail for nearly killing me?.  That microchip works like a tv my eyes project images my dreams are controlled my mind still read etc.  Ms. Knowles your the first celebrity I saw from the microchip in my eyes in my mind.  My eyes were closed you had on my twin brother clothes that I saw him in.  I suppose the microchip showed what I saw looking at 2014 at Mammee Bay.  When I saw the picture you were coming upward out of darkness like in an India position.  I don't know what it means.  I did dream about Rihanna Fenty at Mammee Bay 2014 it's not my first dream of USA celebrities.  Beyonce if you have anything to do with how I'm living it's cruel and evil I live without my daughter I live outside even when it rains.  I have to beg for money I have many small arms inventions that are on the internet without my permission.  I'm fed-up of sleeping outside the Jamaican people incite problems to get me into trouble to get me sued or to put me into prison.  I believe I'm still being used for demonic purposes without my permission or control even when I'm asleep.  When will this stop?.  I was 37yrs old 2015 I will 45 YRS old this August 2022 and I still live outside and away from my daughter.  I have not been involved with a woman for over 8yrs which is another of their punishment.  It's unconstitutional considering that USA FEDERAL GOVERNMENT/ Jamaican government and the European government members are involved.  Why have I not been contacted by the feds or by my family?.  Did my mother bring you guys in with the feds with the manufacturing of my INVENTIONS that have up-setted some people that has caused me to be on the streets for 7yrs?.  Will I ever get out of this situation to be back with my daughter?  Am I here till my mother put the money back her and my family have squandered?.  Or am I waiting on immigration papers to be taken back to the USA and are you guys helping with that?.  Or am I being brought back because I lied to the government to serve time?.  Ms. Kathy Ireland and Mr. Warren Buffet/  Mr. Obama lots of people are implicated even the CIA.  How can I be on the streets for so many yrs when there are people of influence?.  I didn't sign up for this I need my freedom and the right to own and manage my INVENTIONS I didn't give my mother the permission to represent me.  My family took advantage of me because I'm not in America they could not have done what they have if I knew or were in America.  How have they gotten away with it when there are USA FEDERAL GOVERNMENT agents?.  I have asked to talk with a lawyer they have not sent the lawyer.  Who is representing my inventions and company?.  I didn't give anyone the permission it's fraud even if it's my mother it's illegal.  I'm demanding the freedom for I and my daughter according to the United Nations.  The agent Mr. Mike ZEPPIERI ATF he can go to jail for allowing a crime.  The USA FEDERAL PROSECUTORS MS.. Elizabeth F. MARINGER and Mr. Michael Q. English can also go to jail for this crime.  Thank you for listening Beyonce.  From Mr. RASAKI SIBOSTON WALLACE AND DAUGHTER ATARAH PATRICIA WALLACE SHE'S 8 YEARS OLD.  Kevin.
Omgg I love this interview!!! 😭😭❤️ Nicki did soo good!! 😍😍 she’s so beautiful and funny and so entertaining!! 😍😍💕 woww it is so fun to watch her!! 🥵 you go Nicki 🥰🦄

BOOBAS.
Yesssss Nicki!!!! Did such a great job they have great chemistry together and are very entertaining I definitely wanna see more of these two together in the future
I think Nick can have her own show she's really good at it.
Onika Maraj is such a diamond
Here , baby , here  https://youtu.be/gsjh_ptesLk
She is a queen of rap that's why she can do what she want
Nicki Minaj has so much personality...I love her!
Congratulations to Nicki Minaj with her first child. 👏🏽
I would definitely watch her on Late night. The show needs someone black now, not just in the band.  Her and James Corden would be good for a New show style. 👩🏾 🌸 🧔🏽
Nicki 👑
Nicki needs her own show or to continue to host shows because her personality is literally a NATURAL for tv. Love her!
Barbie 🤩
this is the worst
what the fuuuuuuck
What in the actual fuck
No thanks, still not ok with Nicki lying about vaccines.
For God so loved the world that He gave His one & only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. (John 3:16-17)✝️
this is so awkward & dramatic it’s annoying 😒
Nicki hands down has always been facially one of the baddest women in the game
Damn, she’s still remy ma’s #1 idol. She’s still impersonating her til this day lol
Nicki is corny.
🔥🔥🔥🔥 #boom
Im from Northern Ireland and those impressions at 9.02/9.04 by both of them are spot on!! However, we dont all speak like that in the North of Ireland but some do and Nicki and James have got it just right!
Will always love nick on of my favourite artists period in the top 5
Nicki Minaj should have her own interview night show where she's the host💚💕💚💕💚💕
I love Nicki
I'm so lucky to live where Nicki Minaj & Jessi exist
For a lady who: Is trying to silence the rape victim of her husband with money Paid her rapist pedo brother out of jail after he raped a 15 years old girl Married a murderer Lied about the covid vaccine to get attention off from her murderer husband's court trial Blocked fans who asked her to pay hommage to the victims of Orlando gay club shooting Blocked fans who supported other female rappers Does cocaine on live Instagram Thinks Billboard rules are changed to be against her when those things are announced months before her release Had leaked demos saying the gay f word slur when 99% of her fans are gay boys Keeps collabing with rapists & pedophiles, touring with them, for some quick high char positions  she has a lot of support
Yes please. I would watch every night. :)
This never gets old 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm so not Amarican
Okay ALL scripted! I see now
She’s so beautiful and smart
Legend

I know this keeps showing in my feed, but I’m not feeling it y’all .. I won’t ever have respect for any woman that gloated and laughed at another woman, child at that, being abused sis, not for fame or money..

Nicki is so so amazing ❤️❤️
P.S you can skip the BS and get to Corden @3:34 PS.. keep in mind this woman is the role model for millions of little girls around the world. So basically.. We are fscked.
Holy shit, please get her out of the studio ASAP. I do not watch this show for this. Oh my god.
She should have her own talk show tbh she’s very charismatic and a natural entertainer
Give her her own show We are ready!
Queen
Damn! Woman can act!
👸 queen 💗💗💗💗💗💗
Nicki needs her own show. Also, her facial expressions are funny
❤️❤️❤️it
She should really take james job like every film
Nicki is so gorgeous! ❤️
Mate, everyone who is _actually_ English, INCLUDING James Cordon, KNOWS that's a terrible, cliché accent, the kind Americans ALWAYS do, because they think we ALL sound like Michael Caine or the cast of Mary Poppins. 🙄 Stop encouraging it, it's just cringe. James tries too hard to be a yank/seppo.
legit am still waiting for a Minaj Carpool Karaoke
She’s so cute 🥰
james is looking really good
Awesome, brilliant duo. Nicki killed the show. Dang it 🤙😝🤷💥. Okuurrrr 💃🤝
Good.
I love her british accent to good 👌🌟
I love her energy

The too-obviously-staged part almost killed me but I kind of liked the whole interview. But I don't think after all these years, the only thing you can ask Nicki Minaj is doing the British accent. She can do way more than that please
I love this duo😂
She’ll be blasting one of my favorite songs baddest b*tch😂😂😂 genuinely love Nicki
Nicki is such a babe❤️ love her voice
Classic reg 😂😂😂

After her having her son she looks different in a great way I love momma on her

Seen 2/17 sd 13 days ago
Nicki is just so beautiful and fun, I love her! 😍
She is sooo goddamn sexy women omfg
This was really enjoyable. Her animation was just enough to be entertaining and still have some seriousness sprinkled in. They're great together fr.
WE LOVE THE QUEEN OF RAP! Thus made me so happy
This woman is timeless, she looks the exact same as 10 years ago
“Where I use to get it poppin in 😝!” 😂😂

❤❤❤
The accent was 100
An icon
I loved this❣️🥰🤣It was everything late night tv should be❣️🤍❣️🤍
She's fat in the chest and keeps pulling on that fake hair
1:50 Nicki face had me rollin 😂😂
Is there an alternate version of this opening that doesn't have that incredibly overrated trainwreck??? 10 seconds of hearing her voice, I was praying I'd go deaf.
fat
I want her to get back into actinggg
#anitta
this is giving me in love Lucy
and crazy how they never did carpool karaoke
She is pregnant again...
Damn she look good with them big t

NICKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
I have to admit, James Corden is funny as hell.... and Nicki is boobalicious, nyummm nyummm nyummm.
Man, imagine if it was Nicki and Craig Ferguson though 😪
She's got skillz to pay the billz. Charisma on demand. She's fine, too.
Awesome!
Its got bigger and bigger
:))
James Corden should withdraw his anti Trump comments he made as per the Durham Report. Cheap jibes you made were false
Her bubbly personality is lit lol 😆
She actually talks in a way we can all understand, so yeah, she did great!  It was entertaining.
She killed it!!!!!

Nicki is definitely bring back 2010 vibes she's amazing❤🥺🔥🔥
I'm not a fan of her recent songs, but you can tell acting was her first love, before she got into rap. So charming and cute 😄
“And I’m Here” ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 😍
I didn't laugh at all 😐
"I am a brrrroadcaster" 😂😂😂😂
nicki looks like a boogies chick

Flopnick

Boycot beijing games!
James cordon is by far my favorite late show host, he’s so genuine and fun, never snarky and shady  Like Andy cohen. James’ guests all look like they have a good time
Nicki's facial expressions are everything
I totally loved this  Nicki was on fire!!!! That’s my girl. Always the ultimate Barbie!!!
This women's egos so big she thought men wanted her lol now she got an ex convict😂😂😭 she looks like a used 304 that voice damn nails on a chalkboard lol

This was amazing lmao 🤣
Am so in love with Nicki ❤️😍
I'm so grateful ❤️❤️
If you been rocking with Nicki since the mixtape days then you know her baddest bitch remix
Nicki needs her own show period 💪🏾💯
She did gr8
I think she must go back to acting you no nicky she one of those people she can make you laugh
It’s the triple “HI’s” for me 😭
👍👍👍🌍🌍🌍👆
I fell in love with this show.  oooh I love "Nicki', she really has a talent as a presenter ❤️❤️ I enjoy it from the Ivory Coast 🇨🇮
Queen of rap game ❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
❣️❣️❣️❣️🤙💯
Nicki can do literally whatever she wants, hosts a show in a bra and waist trainer and looks fantastic 🤣
Nicki should get her own show, she did super amazing
Damm nicki dosent age 😒

I love Nicki Minaj she so humble and pretty at the same time🤤😍
This is what I call proper entertainment!
QUEEN
QUEEN!!!🙏🏾💝🦄
How the hell the table did that?😧
NICKI SO CUTE
Nicki should act more she is good at it.
No big DEAL : According to the Philidephia TRUMPET - She bought the Mississippi DELTA to Grow COTTON 4 Soxs and we said we would NOT let Her her MONEY Got TOOK - Cracker. NOW there is $80 Billion worth of Nuklier BOMB's 200 Miles UNDER North America saying : That's Fine there is NOW just a NEW Panamal Canal - North Mexico has a BEACH and South Canada has a BEACH. She's 95 and wants a New Canal tour to China - Before she Died... Keeping it REAL. Sterling. I chopped Her Dog up in GA. It bit me I flushed it Down the Toilet ! STERLING / Ford Truck's. ME !
Love the comical relief laughter is food for the soul 👏😏
If James would make Nikki his "Ed McMahon", this show would revive in a way that would be amazing, entertaining, and just culturally ground breaking.
She got thicker after the baby but I ain’t can’t complaining lol. Tig ol bities
I love how her face expretion goes l feeling like want to grab her body 4real 4real🖤😆
The way she glows when she talks about papa bear!!!!
see we can't let james get off like that
The Queen 😭🥰❤️‍🔥🥰🧡
I freaking love Nicki ❤️
This was 👍
She’s so beautiful for no reason I love her
She’s so beautiful
I love the queen
It’s giving …. OH NOW SHE WANTS TO BE CUTE & Goofy on shows. Its giving CARDI B vibes 😂
Why do we chronically touch our hair when we’re being watched? It’s like we have a twitch or something. I be wanting to shake us and say “leave your hair alone dammit it’s so distracting.” I can’t talk bc I do the same thing when I’m on camera. But honestly I think it’s a self-conscious thing especially for BW.
Nicki can really have her own show. She needs to take over for Wendy Williams. She would be fly, funny, and SHADY?!! Her Co-host needs to be Nene Leakes or Jason Lee. They would shake shit up!!
WE NEED A NICKI MINAJ REALITY TV SHOW I NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING BRO SHES HILARIOUS
nickiiii😭💖
The Queen really needs her own show or podcast🔥🔥
Love her on this show
This is truly entertaining
She needs her own show .she was perfect
Drizzle is King over my whole world planet. Hand over. Hand over all power and authority.
I LOVE HER
I wish she’d stop playing with that bloody wig!
Pop some bubbly it's the queen's jubbly💀💀💀💀😭😭
😂😂😂 crying lol
She looking thicka than a snicka 🥰😍 beautiful.
She was actually funny… I didn’t hate this… I would actually watch y’all in the mornings…. 😎
Nickis coming Nickis here and it’s not a damn thing anyone can do about it!!!! 🥰😍🥰😍😘🥰🥰Muuuahhahahhhaaa
When Nikki retires from being a pop singer, she has a place in late night
This should be a new segment
She needs to do more hosting…she’s funny…this like a sitcom
oh james is an actòr
Nikki come back is real! Love how after her baby she’s not letting know one forget about her❤️❤️❤️❤️💯
She's nice🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩
I just can't not look at those bad boys😅😍
☺😍🤗🤾‍♀️
Queen Nicky dominate 🥰🥰🥰
She staring to look like aunt Nicki 🤣
Nicki u shd hv yr own talk show , u are super good in everyfin . Much love from GHANA
BOYCOTT The Late Late Show with James Corden for having an anti-vaxxer, a spreader of false vaccine information, and a spreader of the big lie on his show. James and his program should know better than to support some one who spreads lies no matter how famous they are. Unless she apologizes to the world for her lies she is not worthy of being on such a reputable ... or is it any more .... television program.
I really missed her voice <3
This was cute entertaining
She the QUEEN no doubt. And yet so professional . Love her and wish her the best on her comback! #QUEEN
damn this woman is so beautiful...damn her hubby is a lucky man
She makes me feel so much happier I’m from nyc she reps our city & state so well 🗽😍❤️
Nicki Queen💘💘💘💘💘💘💘
Nicki  "The Queen" Minaj-Petty will always Reign Supreme, she definitely needs to be on her  own show or something! She is funny & real! She has the  best personality & she is funny! Keep shining!
Nicky💞❤️💓🥰
Nicki!!!
She'ss a better host then James lmao
The energy 🔥🔥
I’m gonna have to ask you to leave 🤣
Nicki on celebrity drag race >>>>
Frenemies got weird
💕
Looks better thicky thick and "naturalish"
6:10 is so funny to me 😭
as awful as nicki was to leigh-anne, i cannot deny how well she did
Do we want Nikki on tv? yesssssirrrrr!!
*sigh* is there anything nicki is not good at?... She just does it all so effortlessly.this looked easy for her. I can't even keep up😮‍💨 🤩🥰🤪
I love nicki, thats all I have to say 👑 💖
Nikki has worn out that accent Christ is 2022
This had me cracking up…..
Nicki has been doing a lot of hosting (killed real housewives reunions) so I have a feeling something will come in the future ☺️
She should play… I dream of genie (hood edition)
She ate doing Adele
Is nicki pregnant again?
Nicki needs to be your new co-host! I knew nothing about her but of course fell in love with her here and have since wiki'ed???? her life and LOVE HER!
she is so much funnier than james tho
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
If she doesn't take Wendy Williams spot during the daytime then she's going to take one of those spots.
Didn't you retire
Whose here for A Later Late night show w Nicki M☝🏾
Nicki out here looking like (New-New) from ATL😂😂
She a slayyyyyerrrr
True sagg ♐️♐️♐️ right here, we’re definitely The Best ‼️‼️
I love Nicki so much, she is kind and the real queen of rap 🇵🇭
"Pop some bubbly it's the queen jubilee" is stuck in my head now.
🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄
💕
My 👑❤️ so gorgeous
She could actually host a late night show tbh. Would be some good shit.
She got it!!
Nicki Minaj is EXTREMELY talented! I love her so much and I am so proud of her! The Queen of Rap! ❤️❤️🦄🦄
How about doing skits on Biden he is now the president and they are plenty of monologues. The way he speaks it’s funny, Pelosi imitations one tic tocker does and she’s funny. I don’t understand why only trump he’s old news. But, I guess he’s on the news and it’s fit the narrative I guess. But, I don’t see any imitation on this new administration double standard, oh I forgot Kamala Harris skit how the way she laughs the tic tocker does her too. It’s funny lol
Like the croc slippers
She’s so beautiful 😍

Nicki needs her own show like Nick Cannon...Here's an idea for a title, "The Minaj Show" ...i'd watch it 100%
Is it just me or it seems like Reggie laughed too much. I think he has a huge crush on Nicki.

Why I thought this was wayyyy more entertaining she did amazing I was totally in the moment like yesss keep going.. til James came in 😒
She is just an incredible human. Many laughs needed. Thank you!!!
I feel like Nicki is the only one who could pull this off. Effortlessly funny!
Fank you 😭😭😭
7:56 she sounded like Adele with her "Thank you!"
If I’m a Head Honcho TV Executive— (and I should be)- Nicki Minaj would have her own late night show. Ratings would be through the roof!! She’s extremely talented and the telegenic personality beams - she can squeeze blood out of a turnip and make it smile and get laughs!!🤣🙏🏿🌅☝🏾❤️
I don't understand who the hell is still giving her these lame ass hairstyels all the time. She is actually so gorgeous and hot with her natural hair!
Why should they walk out
Anything's better than James Corden 🤷
🥰
Basic humour
She's so fucking cute
Surprised they let an antifaxxer host xD
See me smiling like a fool. Gosh i love this lady
You make Us so happy I love you 😘💕❤️  And happiness Looks grate on you  I Love you Queen 👑 #signBarbs 🦄🤎👑😪🥰😘
Wow! Nicki is a natural ❤️🔥
🤣🤣🤣
Nicki needs her own talk show.  Tbh

How does she do it the voice thing
Nicki really is a natural 😆
Nicki Minaj’s British accent sounds like Keeley Jones in Ted Lasso.

Is the voices in the studio records?
We're not talking enough about how old the English Queen is, I've lost a couple of relatives and she's still alive. The 50-60+ years old ffs
Name a sm after her immediately
i love her!!
Please do a carpool with Pentatonix https://youtu.be/L1nQpoAvTSg

This was in a play loop so Glad it was so confused at first but then I was just like this needs to happen more !!!!!! James is funny as fuck and Nikki is dope as fk like hold up makes the desk bigger how though magic of showbiz I get that but did I smoke to much cause she came out within a second with a biddazzeld bell # I want my own cup !

Oh I would watch Nicki do a talk show FOR SURE!!!. Also that English accent was scary good. :P
Nicki has grown on me over these years
😉Great job, Nicki !  (From Normandie, France)
Love you Nicki 😘😘😘
Love her😂😂😂
They should make this a weekly thing or a regular thing on her off time when she's not promoting an album.
The newwwssss....
Well. James. Just recolonize her country(ies). 😆
Nickiiiii 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
James is pushing it  mans better back up
I love this woman more than anything
I love this lady so much 🥰
This was really weird on the day of my father’s death. Well, I should say murder. Interesting lifestyle you all have in USA, human beings and “politics.”
I like how they're still trying to distract people from the actual problem and the fact that they stole the 2020 elections. Hollywood, such a fraud system of controlling! Smh
Her British accent sound like Adel
He is abroad
We need her on the showww!!
I’ve been a barb since I first saw the “your love” video release on 106npark. I got the bangs and started acting like her. Lol yes queen pur 💅🏾
She gained a little weight and it looks good on her.
James, I ain’t here for you, I’m here for the queen, don’t get it twisted 🙄💅
not too much on the Queen ok 💀💀💀💀 6:48
heeyyyy nicki 🥰🥰

Killed it
She’s a natural.
The Queen is the Queen yesssss
That was so bad. Was any of that unscripted
so is no one gonna talk about how she did a belfast accent like 😭 it even slipped into derry with the first 'nai' 😭
Love Nickiiiii💗💗💗💗🦄
Шикарная!
She is the queen ❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nicki definetly need her prodcast
Nickie and James  we really  good together  and it was just natural and entertaining .

Damn Nicki is beautiful 🔥🔥
Nicki so much Fun
Love it
Hair onnn poinnnttt

Nicki is the Queen 👑
she really pulled out martha zolanski with that desk trick
Amazing. Can't wait for her to have a show. This was so good to watch.
Time to stop watching this! Cheap cheap cheap
Nick Minaj + TV = Magic .  She has proven this since American idol.
LOVE THIS, NICKI QUEEN
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Ok, im not even that much of a Nicki fan, but this was GOOD! She’s SO good as a host. I’m sure someone’s gonna offer her a late night show after this
Keep your family away from this shit.
We need a carpool karaoke with nicki
She's such a great inspiration for our younger generation 🤢🤮😒
I can tell she really loves acting a lotta people don’t know that she actually was passionate about acting i think continuing her acting career will be so interesting.
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
She’s such a natural. I enjoyed this 👏👏👏👏👏
Why they gotta bring Nicki into politics , and late night shows need to shut up about the political shit honestly
How is she still relevant?
perioddd
It's a Northern lrish accent not an Irish accent
she’s so adorable
She's so good
Rape apologist
Blackfishing supporter
Disgusting
Queen of anti vaccination
Blackfishing supporter
How is her cousin's friend's balls Now?
Rape apologist
Give a trash can vibe
How she got away with Jesy Nelson blackfishing controversy and anti vaccines controversy??? This is a ridiculous  She has signed up with devil
❤
watching her would be like , Nicki needs her  own show..❣️❣️❣️❣️
a bigger pair of c5nts has never graced a screen together..
Nicki Minaj's from Carryduff.
I love her,she's wonderfully theatrical😍
Don't like Nicki Minaj Carly B is better
She should definitely have her own show cause she’s amazing as a host
James please disappear
Where’s the other guy I’d rather see him …..
Hi
We need Nikki back on TV fast!!
She is made in china look at her arm
Nicki has such a loud personality I love that she’s beginning to be a guest on more things and putting herself into more things. I feel like she was overlooked for so long
BARBZ! This is NOT a drill 🚨🚨🚨 "Do We Have A Problem" is currently less than 40 points away from #1 on The Billboard Hot 100! BUY, stream on ALL platforms, request radio play, and share this song on ALL social media!!! Let's get it! 🦄👑
Her vibe is everything. Love her so effing much.
Напомнила выскочку.
she is so precious
People don’t actually watch stuff like this do they?
Ok, im not even that much of a Nicki fan, but this was GOOD! She’s SO good as a host. I’m sure someone’s gonna offer her a late night show after this
Nicki Minaj has Adam's apple oh my gawd
“I don’t talk about money” should be the name of her next single 💵
I came here cos I was a thousand percent sure everyone will agree with me that NICKI NEEDS HER OWN SHOW. Sign the petition!
https://youtu.be/YIzl-s-mWO8
Best episode ever
Ice panda
This was really cute!
She's too cute❤️❤️❤️
THE LATE LATE WITH NICKI AND JAMES 💗💗
Her pink mug is too cute 😭😭💗💗
If she ever retires as a rapper, SHE NEEDS TO HAVE HER OWN LATE NIGHT TALK SHOW !!!! 💗💗💗
Proof we need QUEEN RADIO back lol
MULTI-TALENTED QUEEN 💗💗
Loved Nicki’s British accents,… with a splash of eye-roll side-eye. Lol. She was great. Totally hilarious.
Gosh Nicki is soo funny and absolutely adorable! 😭 I adore her sm 💕 She seems so happy, she's literally glowing! ✨ She is an icon, she is a legend, she is the moment yall! 🤗🦄👏🏽 Such a QUEEN! 👑
Everthing I have seen Nicki on has shown her real intelligence.  She plays the silly girl part well but it's ALL a setup  and she is brilliant.  I enjoyed this so much and want to thank James for having the balls to let someone else take center stage for a while.  I think they must have a great "away from work" relationship....two people who are really good at what they do - music, dancing, singing and comedy.  I seriously think Nicki could be a threat to any talk show host whose ratings are tanking.  Her appeal to all kinds of people because of her non-racial humor that is so relavent that she would be an amazing talk show host.  Maybe in a few years.  Luv ya Nicki
She looks beautiful my queen I love her 😭💖
7 at best
I adore Nicki!!!! And I live in Ireland and the accent failed. Wrong on all accounts. Just no. No. Stop it's insulting
the very beginning of 6:19 she matched his energy with a British sounding "no". I'm literally crackin tf up
So did she get vaccinated?
Love Nicki ❤️
She’s so hilarious and quirky😂😂
She so cute 🦄🦄🦄
THIS IZ WHAT WEVE BEEN MISSIN!!!!!!
James do Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts w/ Nicki Minaj.
I’m not to hype these celebrity hos but there’s something about Nicky 🤤
More more more of Nicki 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🐐🌩⚡️🫀🫁🧠💫💯
I don't even watch this show, but that was good. He should have her on more. Good chemistry
She's so gorgeous for this world 😻🌍
Nicki gained weight i love it😍
Nicki minaj is so cute she could do children tv shows
My 2 faves Nicki and Lily in the same place.. I did not expect this!
Honestly, a male/female late-night duo talk-show isn't such a bad idea. I've never been fond of the daytime version, but putting it after the Watershed could really make it work.
QUEEENN
Look at thicky Nicky
This is the cringiest thing ive seen in a while
Is this the full video?
❤👑
NICKI is a whole mood!!😂❤❤❤
The hold on 😂
Nicki is hilarious!!!
I’m so happy to see nicki doing her thing again as the queen she is SHE’S BACK YA’LL 💖💖💖💖
Keep her molesrter husband and brother away!
kawaii was i know
Nicki Minaj can get it
Absolutely loved watching this 😂😂😂😂😂
Sooo... Are we really not gonna talk how Nicki Minaj just used THE FORCE???
NICKI NEED HER OWN TALK SHOW!
Did she finally get vaxxed?
I really dislike James.
Our wee Belfast queen

Finally, nicki Minaj on the late Late show 😭😭😭😭
Shes such a queen
Her acting and facial expressions are amazing 🤩😂😂😂😂
You guys are so ridiculous…. The world is collapsing, a war is nearby. We are not stupid, we know your BRAINWASHING scheme. 4 years of Trump, no war whatsoever, since fake president Biden took over the world is collapsing, and all because AMERICA, which it’s citizens thinks that AMERICA is the best, and everything is fine. Guess what, ITS NOT. the west (I’m from the west) is pushing Putin to a war, and you brainwashed people can’t see it ! This will be a fucking disaster, Russia is a nuclear power, and they have advanced missiles… I don’t know if you know, but Russia is border with Alaska. Stop watching this BS tv shows . Wake up to reality, because your bed, your house, your FREEDOM might not be there tomorrow. The media are OUR ENEMY ! Fuck them
"James is forced to share his desk with Nicki Minaj"????? he is HONORED to share his desk with her.
they better change that mug to the late show with nicki minaj bc she's not going ANYWHERE
SHES SO PRETTY OMG!!
stream do we hv a problem
Ok Nicki it's time to start acting. Get the bag.
That was fun. We need more of this!
This is was litterally the best MIDNIGHT SHOW EVER lmao, Nicki has full command and very funny. Nicki should do this like so fun hhaha
Nicki need her own show🥰
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
This interview was so beyond funny omg, Nicki NEEDS to have her own talk show or something one day 😩
Like we needed ANOTHER REASON NOT TO WATCH THIS CRAP..

Her cute pink cup and pink bell 🛎
That panda outfit looks like a big pair of Tidy-whites pulled over his head- no wonder it has pain in his eyes!
❤❤❤
So is Nicki vaccinated now, she needs to address that b4 she talks about anything. She caused a lot of damage and it does need to be addressed.
8:54 northern irish idk why y'all say irish

QUEEN!!!!!!!!
Praying for my family, my 10 year old daughter and I are divided . Shes being manipulated against me , I have been battling a court case for two years now I was falsely accused of abusing my daughter had a fasle protective order out which was dropped in last August . My daughter’s father is in church supposed to be a minister and doing everything he can to hurt me . This man is keeping my child away from me she’s disrespectful towards me , basically don’t want to have anything to do with me, she won’t talk to me . I’m paying my support, doing all I can do; I pray that God turn this situation around and restore me back with my ten year old daughter. I miss her so much it hurts my heart to No that I don’t have rights to my child because someone else is trying to replace me . I been through a lot and I’m tired my heart is heavy so is my mind . Please keep me in prayer🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Nicki needs her own show OWNED BY HER....that way she can just be HERSELF with noone to answer to.
This was fly...👏🏾👏🏾
Nicki > James
The Queen is Back ! 👑
Nicki could actually legit have her own show.  She’s made for this! ♥️♥️
I'd actually watch news if Nicki is the host💜👑🔥
I would definitely watch her show she could name it “Nicki at Night “ We need you 😂
She looks so chubby and thick, it's the happiness for me😘🤗
Nikki legit needs her own show or podcast
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love this 😂😂
Yessss Nicki!!!!
This was excellent.
She looks sooo radiant and happy
https://youtu.be/W9EQYKtEXSk
Since James has left, I think Nicki should takeover
That shit you see them spraying in the sky?  That's aluminum, barium, and strontium that they're poisoning you with....susus
James Corden the Russian propaganda-pusher.
HEAR ME OUT…. Carpool Karaoke with Nicki Minaj
Sccccccurt
Shes so gorgeous I caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaant even
Best celebrity hijack for me
The #chemistry is 💯💯💯
Meh.
She NEEDS TO HAVE HER OWN SHOW. Loooove Her voice
I smell a Nicki Minaj Carpool Karaoke coming soon, I hope!
Will there be a carpool?
when i see a women like nicki minaj, i know that the judgment day is coming near
I think she should genuinely make a show with him they have mad chemistry i love her
Very entertaining. 💖
She's so sweet and funny
Nicki 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
It should've been just nicki what's cordon doing there
🤮🤮🐕🐕🤮🤮
Saggy….nasty
Those two dudes need to lose some weight
is she vaxxed?
Look how big dem.......got 😍
Look, at this point we should all just bow down now. If Nicki continues acting, forget about it 🥵😍
This was so much better than it had any business  being. Nicki is funny.
This was absolutely epic ! Nicki and James reading the News together? Can we have more of this please … I love it!
Nicki I love and missed you so much 💜❤️
She funny 😆 🤣🤣 she need her own show.
Nicki💯🌹🌹🌹🌹💯
If a waiter or waitress is waring a Mask I make it a POINT NOT TO TIP them at the end of my meal. Sometimes I will not even pay for the meal and walk out disgusted 😒
Loved this!!

Always fun watching Nicky
Love Nicki so much❤️🦄
This is so funny to watch 🤣pure comedy I love it❤️
🔔🔚
Hunter Binben is the the Winter games mascot
I love nicki
I like this Nikki 🤩💕 and this would be a good skit for show they to funny!🤣🤣🤣
Love this so refreshing 😘😘😘
Couldn't watch this nauseating circus act for any longer than two minutes. So false. So phoney. I just can't stand this kind of crap anymore. It's like a crappy Butlins stage play.
This was better than all the snl skits since 2013
MOOD!!! Omg pleasee she must have her own show!!!!
She's iconic
Why does Nicki have so much chemistry with all the late night hosts, Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert, and now James  she’s a natural at this
For many, she's forever associated with the anti vax comments. this show has no standards.
Not bad! Congrats
I’m in tears
I watched this multiple times and laugh every time 😂😂
Nickiiii
why does the US love slap stick jokes not funny at all
Not actress Nicki purrr😭
Nicki is a natural ✨
Only Watching for Nicki, this show is whack any other day.
She looks happier, more confident. She's glowing. Can't wait for the album 🙌🏻👑
책상 늘리는 거 진짜 자연스럽다ㄷㄷ
Out of all the female rappers, she is literally the best at interviewing and hosting shows. So relatable, articulate, witty, smart, quick, the list goes on and on! Queen 👑
Nicki is back and I'm hereeeee for it beeeeeetch! 😜
How us your boy Avenatte doing?? 🤣
Is this a comedy show🤣🤣🤣so soo funny🔥
I just had to watch 😍😍😍 I love you Queen👑💜💖💜💖💜#BARB4evaaa🦄🦄🦄🦄
Man she's a natural,and that British accent,WOAH💯
https://youtu.be/Z-XFWLp7fgE?t=41
It's trending no 8 😩😌
Both should go to the gym a lot more by the looks of it.
Who really watches this
queen you do not deserve this!!!!!’
Is she pregnant with a food baby or a real baby?? You are all thinking it.
Nick is the best
Nicki is an amazing host. I get chills seeing how far she's come, I'm so proud of her and her hustle to get where she is, she's a fucking boss.
JAMES CORDEN SUCKSSSSSS SO BAD I CANNOT STAND HIM
Somehow, I feel like she'd be a better host than James Corden, but only because it's James Corden.
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life887
couldnt even go farther than 8 min, sorry james :c
I want Nicki to permanently take over for James. She's so much funnier
NICKIIIII QUEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNN 😍😍😍😍👑👑👑💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻💅🏻
That actually works, She should be on the main desk anchoring 👍
I have no business loving this woman as much as I do. 🥺😭❤️❤️
This would be so dope if the show stayed with James and nicki minaj...
I love seeing Nicki has so much fun with her career now, enjoy ur fruits mama. 💓
is that laughters edited too ?
& hey from Australia Darwin 🇦🇺🥃🤠
Nicki Minaj and Megan thee stallion are my favorite black female rappers # love they thick booty's all they juicy 🍉🍉🍉🍉
So //Brooklyn really tho Brooklyn

Nicki does impersonations so don’t play her James I also been waiting to see Nicki on masked singer. We’ll hear her 😜😂💯💯❤️

Wow James you can get a vacation now Nicki can be your vacation host. Also she will be a great actress...you can have her in your next movie....or next play. Congrats Nicki Minaj.
Love you james 🧡
She host the show like a pro
"I was this close to figuring out the meaning of life"...underated 😅

Young money is in the building

#Queen #NickiMinaj i love her so much
I love her so much ❤️
Amazing 💜💜
Queen 💕👸🏻

This kind of reminds me of frenemies.
It's the healthy baby weight for me😍😍😍
I love her smile & her period
Nicki is so multitalented even when she retires from music she will still have a career either in acting or media.
I really love this.
She looks amazing 😍😍😍
Why is she so beautiful?!?!?
Her son is the cutest celeb baby.
This energy makes me miss queen radio, I miss it

NICKI IS STUNNING UGH I NEED HER TO HOST AND BE ON TV MORE
It's perfect,so much🤭🤭
Nicki is gorgeous AND funny. She makes an excellent host <3
Nicki is a legend
She’s the cutest queen 👸🏽 💖♥️🥰🥰🐐🖤🐻
Good for you Nicki Minaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaj!😎😎🤣🤣
Nicki 💓💓💓💓🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
I love this for her 😌💖
No Nicki Minaj the queen at the platinum jubilee will be singing, “I wish that I could have this moment for life for life for life because in this moment I just feel so alive alive alive”🎶
James N Nicky morning show...🤔😅😅😅
Nicki needs her own podcast
nicki's aura, confidence, the way she carries herself ughhhh such a lovely soul😍🥰
They should have made a mug just for her!! Lol ...oh wait🤣🤣
So pretty 😍😍😍😍😍
I really hope someone brings up her dumb anti vaccine comments. It’s the elephant in the room. She should at least make a joke about it or something
She just so good!!!!😂❤️ Give Nick her own show❤️❤️❤️❤️
What a queen! I love her. So down to earth.
Queen is totally pregnant with baby #2💙💙💙💙💙
Love James Corden! His Carpool Karaoke is just like our channel’s latest video 🤣
I’ll never understand how people like Nikki Minaj or James Corden. They must be simpletons who need to be told what is good by others who have bad taste.
Ok Nicki needs her own talk show now she would be perfect!!
She needs to host Saturday Night Live
Nicki brings more sparks to the show😍😍😍😍😍
She is funny, but she aged big time ….
I always associate Nicki's British accent with Mother Martha 😅
She Photoshops the hell out of social media pics cause she's looking like a cow here
I used to love Nicki but now that shes married to a registered sex offender and defends him I think much less of her these days.
THIS IS EPIC
band member, "You know what Nicki, I do a little bit of rapping myself" the lowkey shade thou 🤣
It is so cool.
NICKI LOOKS STUNNING.
I LOVE THIS NEW ERAAAAAA
Yet another reason no one watches this dumpster fire. Worst late show ever aired. FFS
Its not cross fit That has kept the Queen going , its buring all those bodies that has done it.
She is so good in everything, Papa bear is a lucky baby
She did awesome 👏🏾🎬
missed her on tv 🥰🥰🥰
I just wish women would stop stroking their weaves/hair and just act smart and normal not ditzy on tv
i enjoyed her presence 💯
🐐
QUEEN
YESSSS
If you don't like Nicki then YOU are the problem.
GET A SHIRT ON!
Nicki needs her own podcast
How she keeps looking finer 😭😭
Queen Nicki looks amazing as always.
Muma yo get fat 💋❤️😳🥰
Touch your hair one more time Nicki
Why does Nicki Minaj sound like Harley Quinn???
Very good podcast
She will forever be known as “Swollen Balls Lady”!
Another reason for no one to watch
Love Nicki. She's my problematic fav lol. Yes I said problematic y'all gotta admit she done questionable things that not even I agree with but still love her ugh 😩💗
If Nicki Minaj does masked singer she has to work out to trick the judges and viewers and changes her voice but the barbs will know it’s her. They’re smart
we need the queen on SNL asap
I wasnt expecting this wtf 😭
Is no one going to say how she slayed the British accent 😅  "Do u know how much space and air and time it took to say that" 😂 good point
I am LIVING FOR THIS PINK FUCKING FRIDAY!
She is GLOWING
I love the NICKI MINAJ show  👸👸👸👸👸👸👸👸👸👸👸
Bubbly... Jubbly... AAAHHHHHHHHHH!!
I will never buy music from an artist who willing marries a rapist. Why is this woman still relevant?
She is actually funny
I ENJOYED THIS!
Mark 8:36- “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” Anyone that does not make sure they have taken care of their soul will end up destroyed. Your soul is the part of you that is eternal. It is tragic when a person dies and is not sure of where they will spend eternity.
I love you Nicki 🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄❤️❤️❤️❤️
🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹
I love yu 😍😍🥰🥰
Haha, classic
3 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”  4 Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. 6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the beginning of birth pains.  9 “Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. 10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, 11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. 12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13 but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
honestly wish Nicki Minaj or someone would take the job from this idiot.. dude is so cringe, Craig was better.
This was so much better without the audience. The show was different for a second and a half.... The laughter and cheering feels so ingenuine. I don't think I'll be watching.
This makes me like her more
What does "Touche" mean? Asking as a foreigner.
Yaaassssss Queen Nicki paying homage to The Baddest Bitch Trina!! 🙌 #QueenTingz
British people don't say 'properly good' just james 🤣🤣
I love it😘
These two should do a 30 minute news show every night!  I'm all in for that show.
Arrogant tae be slaying Nicki Minaj’s hair😩😩
She had everyones attention for sure !!! that room spoke volume!
She should definitely have her own show cause she’s amazing as a host 🦄🦄🤣

nicki fucking beautiful
La muerte, es uno de los eventos más grandes que jamás tendrá lugar en tu vida.   Afrontamos la muerte todos los días, consciente o inconscientemente de ella; la muerte acecha en cada rincón de nuestra vida. Como un león esperando atrapar a su presa, la muerte nos llega a todos en muchas formas y formas; aparentemente no hay nadie que pueda escapar de las fauces de la muerte.   ¿Pero sabías que hay una razón por la que morimos? La idea de la muerte con la que está familiarizado es solo la punta del iceberg. Mira, morimos porque hemos pecado contra Dios. La muerte según la Biblia es paga "porque la paga del pecado es muerte" (Romanos 6:23).Debido a que el hombre pecó contra Dios, vivimos en un mundo caído, antes era perfecto, pero ahora está en ruinas. Ahora que el pecado existe, Dios viene a juzgar al mundo con justicia. Está establecido que un hombre muera una vez y después de este juicio "(Hebreos 9:27). El estándar por el que te juzgará son los 10 mandamientos, la ley moral de Dios.   Él es tan serio acerca del pecado que le dio a cualquiera que pecara la sentencia de muerte, la Biblia dice que te la has ganado pecando contra Dios y cada vez que pecas, acumula su ira. "El alma que pecare, esa morirá". (Ezequiel 18: 4) El castigo son los fuegos eternos del Infierno "Donde habrá llanto y crujir de dientes" (Mateo 13:42)   Tendrás que enfrentarte a Dios el Día del Juicio.   ¿Irás al cielo o al infierno?   Aquí hay una prueba rápida:   1-No tendrás otros dioses delante de mí. 2-No harás ídolos. 3-No tomarás el nombre del Señor tu Dios en vano, porque el Señor no dará por inocente al que tome su nombre en vano. 4-Recuerda el día de reposo. 5-Honra a tu padre y a tu madre. 6-No matarás. 7-No cometerás adulterio. 8-No robarás. 9-No mentirás. 10-No codiciarás.   ¿Alguna vez has dicho una mentira? robado algo? usó el nombre de Dios en vano? ¿Alguna vez has mirado a alguien con lujuria? Él ve la lujuria como adulterio, “Cualquiera que mira a una mujer con codicia, ya adulteró con ella en su corazón” (Mateo 5:28). ¿Alguna vez has odiado a alguien? él ve el odio como un asesinato, "Cualquiera que odie a otro hermano o hermana es un homicida" (1 Juan 3:15)   Santiago 2:10 dice, "la persona que guarda todas las leyes excepto una es tan culpable como una persona que ha quebrantado todas las leyes de Dios".   No confíe en su propia bondad o buenas obras para salvarlo. Eso es como sobornar a Dios para que te deje entrar al cielo; Ni una iglesia, pastor, sacerdote o religión alguna. Ninguno de nosotros es bueno en absoluto, incluso los asesinos, violadores, incluso Hilter se llamarán buenos y tratarán de justificarse por sus buenas obras. Pero la biblia dice:   • "Pero todos somos como cosa inmunda, y todas nuestras justicias son como trapos de inmundicia; nos marchitamos como una hoja, y nuestras iniquidades, como el viento nos llevaron". (Isaías 64: 6)   La definición de Dios del bien es moralmente excelente y, por lo tanto, exige perfecciones absolutas. Nadie puede igualar sus estándares. Por eso Jesús dijo: • "Nadie es bueno sino solo Dios". (Lucas 18:19)   Si ha hecho alguna de esas cosas, Dios lo ve como culpable de quebrantar su ley y la Biblia advierte que los culpables terminarán en el infierno. ¿Serás culpable el día del juicio final?   "Porque la paga del pecado es muerte, pero la dádiva de Dios es vida eterna en Cristo Jesús Señor nuestro". (Romanos 6:23)   Dios envió a su Hijo a sufrir y morir en la cruz. Jesús tomó el castigo sobre sí mismo y derrotó a la muerte en la cruz; no por tu Bien sino porque Dios es rico en misericordia.  "Porque tanto amó Dios al mundo que dio a su Hijo unigénito, el que en él cree no se pierda, sino que tenga vida eterna". (Juan 3:16)  Jesús resucitó de entre los muertos y venció a la muerte. Arrepiéntete (vuélvete del pecado) hoy y confía en Jesús y Dios te concederá vida eterna; también nacerás de nuevo.  Él te dará un corazón nuevo que desea la justicia, lo que es justo y un corazón que amará a Dios.  por eso Jesús dijo: "De cierto, de cierto os digo, que el que no nazca de nuevo, no puede ver el reino de Dios". (Juan 3: 3)  Luego, lea la Biblia y obedezca lo que lee.  ☆ ¿Cuándo vas a estar bien con Dios?  "Hoy, si escuchan su voz, no endurezcan su corazón como lo hicieron en la rebelión" (Hebreos 3:15) "Ahora es el tiempo aceptable, he aquí ahora el día de salvación". (2 Corintios 6: 2)   • "Tampoco hay salvación en ningún otro, porque no hay otro nombre bajo el cielo dado a los hombres en el que podamos ser salvos". (Hechos 4:12)   Es tu elección. Los dejo con esto: "¿De qué le aprovechará al hombre si gana el mundo entero y pierde su alma?" (Marcos 8:36).   Si te estás tomando esto en serio, ¿te gustaría una oración? Esta oración no es garantía de que serás salvo, eso es entre tú y Dios. Sin embargo, me gustaría que este fuera un buen comienzo para su viaje.  "Padre, te agradezco por el corazón abierto de esta persona y le pido que se arrepienta y confíe solo en Jesucristo. También te pido que guíes sus pasos en su camino para que pasen de la muerte a la vida. En el nombre de Jesús Amén.

Death, it's one of the biggest events that will ever take place in your life. We face death everyday, conscious or unconsciously of it; death lurks around every corner of our life. Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and forms; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death.  But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Death according to the bible is wages " for the wages of sin is death " (Romans 6:23).  Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. "It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law.  He's so serious about sin that he gives anyone who sins the death sentence, the bible says you've earned it through sinning against God and God pays you in death. Each time you sin you build up his wrath. “The soul who sins shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell " Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 13:42)  You will have to face God on Judgement Day.   Will you go to Heaven or Hell?  Here’s a quick test:   1.You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)   2.You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)   3.You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?)   4.Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.   5.Honor your father and mother.   6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder, 1 John 3:15).   7. You shall not commit adultery. ("Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).   8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).   9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).   10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealousy desired what belongs to others?)   James 2:10 says, “the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws.”    The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts.   If you have done any of those things, God sees you as guilty of breaking His law and the Bible warns that the guilty will end up in Hell. Will YOU be guilty on Judgement Day?    "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)   God sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross. Jesus took the punishment upon Himself and defeated death on the cross; not because you're Good but because God is rich in mercy.   “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)   Jesus rose from the dead and defeated death. Repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus and God will grant you everlasting life.   Then, Read the Bible and obey what you read.   Pray something like this:   "Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). Today I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."   When you find time please read this, it's Christian principles for growth:   https://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/

A CLASSIC🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🙏🔥
this woman is vile. Harassing the lady her ugly husband raped, offering her hush money, bailing her rapist pedophile brother out of jail, constantly being shady to new rappers in the game, collaborating with abusers and pedophiles, spreading antivaxxx propaganda...

The set up with James and the black cup and bell and nicki with the pink cup and bell is giving me major frenemies vibes also imagine Keke Palmer and nicki Minaj having a talk show together that would be non stop laughing
When she says Baddest Bittch shit had my dying 😭
The British accent impersonation is my favorite thing about her
I think people forget that Nicki attended a performing arts high school. She's always been naturally entertaining, she could really fit in anywhere!
Nicki is hilarious!
We don’t need queen radio we need late night with nicki Minaj talk show

"I think we need to see other people" Lmao, she's funny
Nicki has amazing mimicry skills!   I hope she does do more acting in the future
She’s such fun. I still haven’t recovered from the mega flirting she did on Stephen Colbert Show a couple of years back. Stephen was blushing non stop
Two complete messes

How did they make the desk appear like that? 😂

Hey are you a good person? If you have ever lied,stolen,or taken God's name in vain or broken any of his commandments you are guilty you deserve punishment just like in a court of law if you commit a crime you get justice served to you. God is perfect judge and carries out perfect justice do you know what God did for guilty sinners he went to the cross paying their fine just before he died he said IT IS FINISHED. the debt of mankind has been paid for by his blood he suffered the death penalty on the cross to keep you out of hell. just like in a court of law you can pay someone's fine that's what Jesus did please repent and trust in the saviour today you will be saved this life is a mearly 80 to 90 years but eternity is forever please choose life today come to Jesus he's calling you by name
I love this ❤️
Love Nicky, she's a blast!!
Nicki's facial expressions for me

This is giving me the happy bubbly GOOFY PINK FRIDAY NICKI that I DESPERATELY MISSED ‼️‼️‼️I’m back in high school my freshman year in the hallway playing check it out on my sliding android phone and singing and dancing with my classmates 😊😊😊
not him coming at andacona and superbase 🤣🤣🤣
Nicki is so cute! 😂💕
This just feels GOOD...OMG!!! I LOVE THEM BOTH 💗 💓 ♥
When is the Carpool with Nicki🥲🥲😒😒 we need this James, please.

STREAM DO WE HAVE A PROBLEM
I love her so much, her energy and bubbly spirit is beautiful. And she is genuinely hilarious. 😂
Her cute voice is so cuteeee 😍

Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤

Nicki deserves all the love she gets and more🥰🥰🥰

Worst part: I was going to register for crossfit after James said it
Does she want to be a talk show host? I thought she rapped or whatever...
Ok, im not even that much of a Nicki fan, but this was GOOD! She’s SO good as a host. I’m sure someone’s gonna offer her a late night show after this
I smiled so hard throughout this entire video 😅

The QUEEN!! James, you have a great replacement when you are on vacation!
Truly the baddest
She is so cute and adorable 🥺💗 I love you Nicki 💗💗
What a treat!
Awww she looks so happy
she has a vocabulary of about 20 words; I do not think she could carry a show; but she could carry a dance around a pole...
She’s brilliant
I love her lol
😂😂😂♥️♥️👑👑👑🙌🏾
🦄❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
She really does a very good British accent 🔥
she has such an annoying voice.
Nicki is sooo funny
Yassa! Tha mf Queen of rap!! 💞👑
nicki is a true superstar!!!!
best female rapper of all time 🔥 🐐
I love how no one really cares about the queen and her theater.  I mean, really have we not woke up to them by now? lol Can you imagine how many other deviants have been protected by the crown, because Andrew can't be the only one.
Queen 👸🏽❤️🤩
sure let's just forget about her misinformation about vaccine :(
Thoroughly enjoyed this... James matches everyone's energy
I LOVE HER
I love Nicki so f...... Much
i love nicki im so happy
3:50 Is it true that Trump's former lawyer participated in The Masked Singer? Sry neither do I live in the US nor do I watch the Late Late Show, so I am not sure if this is a joke.
Thx for putting a smile on our face queen Nicki
She needs a show.
Ladies and gentlemen Nick  Minaj
*She did amazing!*  👏
That was so much better than it had any business being. Nicki Minaj is funny.
Give that girl a show! LOVE IT!

THEE Queen Of Rap.
Nikki and James, and the Late Late night band when?
I love Nikki so much this is f****** awesome
✨Fankiu✨
Did I miss the part where Nicki explains her tweet about her cousins friend and vaccinations?!
Queen
she use your desk to spread more misinfo on covid or use it to protect her abusive PoS significant other?
Nicki is hilarious😭 shes so naturally funny😭
Loving her Energy Hilarious
I used to be so obsessed with her I would listen to her music daily, disliked all celebrities who had a problem with her ,at one point I tried changing my voice to speak like her complete fail. love love her
I’ve wanted her on this show for so long
Haha Nicki is funny😭😂
I just love her energy ❤️❤️🥰
i want to see more Nicki and James segments!!
NICKIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!......ICONIC!!!!!🏆...THE QUEEN!!!!!!!!!!!🏆
The Queen of Hip Hop

She did so good! Love her ❤️
Boo
The Queen Elizabeth part had me ROLLING 🤣
Love nickiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
MY QUEEN❤️
I really don't know much of Nicki Minaj's music but I can say that I dig her acting and speaking in front of a camera AND an audience to boot! I would watch a news/talk show with Nicki Minaj' & James Corden for real.
I got you boo-boo 😂😂😂
This is so awesome! Nicki!!🥰🥰😍😍😍
Finalllly
Taking over Late Late takes big…what Nicki’s vax’d friend supposedly has.
2022 IS MY ROTY IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY! ✅😈🤷🏽‍♂️🚀
Nicki is happy and backkkkkkkkk yes girl never give them your energy again your too 🙌 😇 blessed!!!!!!!😍😍😍😍
She did great 🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥
Nikki is so entertaining. I see her career heading in this direction hosting TV award shows or guest appearances with acting. Of course with new music. She seems so happy.

QUEEN IS BACK
MAMA
MY GIRL
Honestly, a male/female late-night duo talk-show isn't such a bad idea. I've never been fond of the daytime version, but putting it after the Watershed could really make it work.
WE HEAAA 🦄
Nicki seems so happy... I love it.
Ok, that works, loved it, impressed. Love to see more of that formula: funny, heart warming and get to know better the guest... And I also do a bit of rapping too...
3:24 HER "YAY" OMGGGGAJH FHJKSBFDKABFKAJSF
2:56 AWWWWWWH SO CUTTEEE
QUEEN ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
QUEEN OF RAP 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
It’s good to see Nikki but this new music is kinda the same old same I want growth
I LOVE YOU NICKI BUT JAMES CORDEN HAS A PUNCHABLE FACE😭 🌟🎀💄🌟
She looking auntie-ishh 🤣
The pink cup y'll
🔥🔥🔥
Dear god she is so awkward.. I will never ever understand why are people like her famous. Before you hate me guys, It´s hard to be me and yes, I often feel, like I am alone in this world.
Love that little scene  in the beginning too funny 😂😂
Idk how to feel about the hair
Yass queen Nicki in the motherfucking house
Love her cant forget about nicki lol
She so cute
NICKI had done her part,it's DO WE HAVE A PROBLEM to one💯💯
The Queen
I love her ! lmao
Good Northern Ireland accent.    But in Ireland there are many accents.
I'm loving the duo. It's probably good!!
I wish Alan carr was still on, their interview was the best!
BARBIA
I am just smiling ALL day over this !!!! :)
🦄🦄🦄
She has to have her own show. Very natural
I would love to see a late night show with two hosts, this format, although just a sketch is everything
Omg, this was so good. Their chemistry and Nicki is so damn funny.
It look like Nicki and Cardi went to the same plastic surgeon. Quickly glance at the screen and it will look like cardi talking
Love it nicki
🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄
Loving her goofiness,she’s so vibrant and happy. She’s in such a good place now . A happy era for the QUEEN
She’s just funny 😂🤣😂🥺🔥
Literally the cutest thing I’ve ever seen! I love her so much!💕
THE ATMOSPHERE CHANGED WHEN THEY STARTED TALKING ABOUT HER KID, AWWW.
Nicki Minaj 👑🦌💥❤❗
She is really a beautiful young lady. And she’s so sweet some people may not know that and that’s probably because you don’t know her
🥰🥰🥰🥰💞💞💞💞💞  I love seeing her on screen omggg
The only Irish accent I can do is when I say "Whale oil beef hooked" aloud. Now have fun y'all 🤭🤣
QUEEN OF RAP
My god.... never thought I'd see a host with bigger boobs than James'.
SHE'S SO ADORABLE IN SOME SENSE HAHAH
I think Nikki needs a show
She’s so fuckin adorable🥺🥺 the cutest and sweetest! So animated! It’s MUVA IN THESE STREETS AND NICKI ON THE TABLE! Her lil “YAY!” 😭😂🥺🥺 and her pouting! aww stink!
I'd love for Nicki to make Queen Radio a late night show like Watch What Happens Live but with a cypher, games and fun!!
😂💕I love Nicki
I waited for this so longgg‼😭
Nicki needs to bring queen radio back
i love this woman with my entire being. she will go down in history as one of the greatest rappers ever.
Yass Nicki 🤗🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤❤
Why she's not performing?
James, you’ve been stateside for too long. As any real Londoner and Brit knows, Jubbly was an orange drink whose advertising slogan “Lovely Jubbly” became the famous catchphrase of Del Boy on Only Fools and Horses. Maybe those plates actually came from Del’s Peckham lockup.
Omggg the full episode ❤️
I NEED MORE. NICKIIIIII
I missed her sooooo much!!!
This is one of my favourite part of the show of all the time.
As far as I am aware, James has not delivered one-liners covering Boris Johnson or Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. Heading back to the UK for good, perhaps ?   (contrary to some, he is far from an irreplaceable talent @ '1230')   😒
This is Nicki in her element
Love that she’s doing more interviews now. We been have a Nicki shortage 😌
first time nicki was ever on the late late show with james cordon
NICKI MINJA HOST 🥺
i love her sm , so glad to be here before 1m

Asi con toy y sus mañas no se la *FUNNYmuvie.Online* hay nomas pa ra reirse un rato y no estar triste y estresado por la vida dura que.
But how did the table show up like that am I the only slow person stuck on that😂😭
She needs her own show atp
She got thick
You i feel so good and blessed NICKI CHILLEEE
This was so much better than it had any business  being. Nicki is funny.
She’s so beautiful and playful. I love it ❤️❤️
One word. Nicki
Ugh highlight of the show!
Queen!!!
The QUEEN OF RAP
The duo you NEVER KNEW YOU NEEDED 😂
Did Nicki renew her illuminate contract ?
Now we got a new alter ego for this era 💕 Cant wait to announce her namee
My god. Nicki was an absolute gem. The Queen of rap! What a treat. Her new single is fire and I will continue to purchase every single, feature, and album that the Queen of music is on. Beyoncé no longer holds that title. Onika Tanya Maraj is the Queen of music!!!! Don’t @ me!!
When Nikki Minaj does a British accent she sounds scarily like Katie price, which is ironic on so many levels.
🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄
no but how did they do the desk thing
Nicki Minaj is the queen of rap
Nicki was wonderful on your show, James! She should do more tv! She also looked so radiant and beautiful. Fun show! 👍🏽
Ok we need a Come back of Ariana And Nicki collab. That’s all I need 👄
Wow many giving praise to her, seems to have forgotten how she made false claim about covid vaccination & swollen testicles, typical Americans, yup give her a platform to make more false claims
Queen 👑
Nicki Minaj looks so beautiful ❤️
I love her confidence
Nicki is a natural
Should have asked her about her friends giant testicles and her husband being a sex offender.
I only came for Nicki I miss her so much I'm so happy my bae is back 🥺🥰🥰🥰💕💕💕💕❤❤❤❤🌈🦄🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love Nicki Minaj 👑❤️🇹🇭
i think reggie is in love with nicky 😘😘😘❤️❤️😂😂
I love her, she is just funny and so cool😂😂👍👍👍
Helllll-O 😍
My baby looks fresher than ever!!
She's the host I didn't know I needed
❤️❤️❤️❤️🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄love you nicki you did amazing
Omg their so funny together I love my queen I’m so happy she’s back love the new song please release bussin
I’m so happy
She's a moment ladies and gentlemen the Queen of Rap Nicki Minaj
I am absolutely loving it♥️♥️♥️♥️
Ariana grande with two ponytails
Nicki Minaj is profoundly irritating.  I know James can't do Carpool lately, but having her flick her hair every ten seconds and having the improvisational skill of a dead slug is awful.  "Ummmmmmmmm...no."  Yeah, great work.  Doesn't help that her voice sounds like the four-year old entitled child of Mark Zuckerberg and some kind of hummingbird.  She is a personality, not a talent.
Yes Nickiiiii!!!!
You guyss she looks so happy. Soo excited for her,this era won't be matched!!🦄🦄❤❤
the meaning of life is getting to know who Jesus Christ is & accepting him as your lord & savior & serving & living for him!  Jesus is the only way to the father (God) in heaven!  we are ALL sinners who have sinned and fallen short of God’s glory! we were all Born into sin.  we are all in need of a lord & savior.  thankfully God sent his son (Jesus) to die for our sins! seek Jesus while you still can! only Jesus offers eternal life! he loves you so very much! 💓 - John 3:16 New Living Translation 16 “For this is how God loved the world: He gave[a] his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.
I had a dream that I was Queen Lizzy and I went to Nicki Minaj and said to her “from a Queen to a Queen, I am a big fan”
QUEEEEN
babie
She's so beautiful 😍
Love the intro
Icon
9:52 Don't you know? it's a Pain-da bear!
She sounds a bit like Janice from friends 😂😂
i love this
Lmaoooo
I hate the way she talks!!!
Ohh my godd🥰🥰🥰
it's the queen show now
Is she vaccinated now ?
Omg!!! I WANTED MOREEEE ( in my British accent) SHE IS A NATURAL!!! WE NEED A NICKI LATE NIGHT SHOW!!🙌🏾❤❤😘😍😍😍
I find James so annoying... I love nicki.. she's so funny..
She's AMAZING
Nicki sounds like a pre school teacher
First appearence since 2018
It's makes me super happy that nicki minaj is backkk , I love you queen

Yikes, stick to James
Nickiii is giving me everything that needs to be given!!! 🔥 It’s our time Barbs 🦄 FINALLYYYYYYYY 🤩💜
The moment we all have wanted
I miss seeing this fun, goofy personality of Nicki!
Nicki Minaj breasts brought me here
Haha James mocking her bc she criticised the brits. Yeah that wasn't too smart. Although I agree with her
😍❤️❤️❤️❤️🇳🇬🇳🇬
Oh damn,she needs her own show now
Nicki is properly good at accents! 👏🏼
My queen

Bro Nicki is sooooo funny… definitely belongs on the screen 🦄🥰🥰
Queen Nicki 👑😍

🇧🇬😊🇧🇬😊🇧🇬
I LOVE IT🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄
Absolutely not. Nicki Minaj is awful. She has spread misinformation about Covid-19. She is married to and supports a man convicted of manslaughter and attempted rape. Why hasn't she been cancelled already.
😂😂❤️🌹🔥👑👑💯💯❤️🥰🥰 love u Nicki
She’s back and thousand time Better  True Queen 👑 💯💯💯💯
nickis english accent is PROPER!
Queennnnnn😍😍😍😍
*PLEASE get her her own show I can watch her all day long*

Best episode of JC show ever
Nicki voted for Trump
Nicki is great at this job
YES BARBS we finally have a show !!! i repeat BARBS have a platform 😭😭💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
I always thought Nicki wound a great voice actor because I heard he do some cartoons and movies and she great
She is really lovely
THIS ERA GON’ SLAP😮‍💨.
The queen herself like fine wine only gets better with time
FINALLY NICKI IS BAAAACK!❤️ BRRRR!
All that comes to my mind when I see Nicki is her friend of a friend of a cousin has permanently swollen to the size of cantelopes their gonads due to the vaccine. Has she ever taken that one back?
finally nicki minaj in late show
I literally missed Nicki in the media so much
😂😂😂😂😂👏🏽👏🏽🌪🌪🌪🌪👑James was not having
Lol
Been the Queen for 12 summers
Queen! She looks so good! 😍🤍
So....she obviously got the vaccine ???
