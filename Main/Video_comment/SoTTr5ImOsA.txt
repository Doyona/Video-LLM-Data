came back, because i’m in that situation right now. it’s so upbeat it gives me hope in a hopeless situation.
Damnnnn!! That was fire! 🔥🔥🔥 How did the algo let me sleep on this for a month?
Checking in on your videos… why u not famous yet??????
Sounds like Devon and Sabrina’s Manchild video persona could have a lot to talk about with their terrible choice in men.
Devon’s so amazing! She doesn’t have to be with Di&$heads ever again
some girls like projects
Another great song girl!  ❤😊
I love this!
Still here 🔥 2025
So original,spunky & fun.luv it❤😊
OMG!!! Girl you just keep getting better and better, and you put a smile on my dial ❤❤❤
This is great.
The song is amazing, but the music video with the cliché of the man "playing video games" again makes it seem like it's the worst thing ever. It seems like women would rather be with a man who hits them or is in a gang than with one who plays video games.
I saw u live at the grey cup! You really lifted my spirits and made me feel love and positivity through your music! You’re really talented !!!
well that ending isnt fair lol
I should have listened to this when a dickhead broke my heart. Amazing vocals, instrumental and lyrics, Devon

GIRL KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD OMG
THESE BLUE NAILS ARE ICONIC
What's wrong with 3-in-1 shampoo?
❤😍💗
Love the 90s vibe and wonder wall reference 😁😉💜
As someone who uses 3 and 1 shampoo I'm offended by the hateful lyrics. Lol
it's a fabulous song on its own, but i do love the choreography of this video so much. shout out to hand choreography, an underappreciated aspect in general!! lmao but seriously, so good all around
New fan here. Your songs are very addictive. WITCH is awesome.
🤣 This is great!
When I first heard this, I thought it was so stupid. Then, I heard 1:22 and said “wait a minute… this kicks ass!”
omg why have I not heard of this chick?... like why is she not every where...I listened to witch,hey cowboy,and dickhead and she is amazing ....kickass!
This song and vid are just fun!  Thanks Devon!
I'm living for that guitar solo @1:22 the rest is just amazing gravy on top!! Definitely an anthem, that makes you wanna shake your booty! lol
Just came across this and it's rare a random song gets my whole upper body rocking back and forth to the beat. Gorgeous voice and powerful melody~ 🤌
can't wait for your new songs
Liked the song until i saw the video.
The fashion in this music video is great.
Please come to Windsor Ontario before or after London Ontario . Please
MY NEW FAVOURITE SONG!!!❤️❤️
Good song but the ending was kinda Inappropriate and gave me anxiety Especially bc I'm 10
Please share the lyrics for international listeners 😭😭😭
was surprised by the title but it seems you are on the edge with every song-your flash at the end  was a complete surprise (we know you have a lovely iugure), great voice and play guitar well-triple threat! continued success-are aany cd's/dvd's out?
I need to know where she got her clothes from 😅😂, I need that top!
just wanna say you slayed, all of your friends slayed and DON´T forget the little girl slayed the most, she was the star of the show🌟
Thank you for this song, i finally dropped him
Looks like midtown T.O. to me.  What neighbourhood was this shot in, Devon?
Love it, the tone and mood of this song are so feel-good and upbeat that I can't stop listening to it.
Why would you want said  dickh to commit….
Went looking for  W.I.T.C.H again and found more bangers. Most underrated hidden  gem of a song writing rockstar.
Holy shit
Omg I love this! Ayyee 👏👏👏  this is perfect!
I need a full version of this YESTERDAY
Im a d*khead to... I mean.. I'm addicted to you and your music. Advice on how not to be a D**khead? I want to be the guy in this song but don't always know how my actions affect others or what behavior to avoid
The algorithm was nice to me today
Oddly relatable as crazy. You guys are amazing.
another awesome tune
Good song. Except that it's about men & I really don't get the attraction.  BTDT  & I was bored AF for yrs. What a waste of perfectly good time, loll.
Where was this song 30 years ago?
uffff, so blessed i found your "paint the town red" - part on insta haha, in looooove with the song!!! <3
this song just smacked me with how catchy it is
You ate do iconic all your songs caprure women-hood so good
wow, you're really killing it eh? This one slaps!
Ooh, mans fancy with that 3 in one shampoo... im still livin in that 2 in one life haha😂
I love this song! But I somehow have two versions on Spotify. In the third verse, I have "you hate Taylor swift," then it's "you don't own your sh*t." And then I have this version of the song
This song's soooooo GOOD! 🔥❤
Devon's song naming skills are simply exquisite.
So fun
Good car
Like it
Love the ending pose of the video! 😊😂❤️
Lmao I just saw the bushes 🤣😂🤣😂
"D**khead" Lyrics   7: 34 sitting pretty at the door When you tell me you got work to do I knew that this was dumb and I probably should have run When I saw your 3 in 1 shampoo  I do this every time I guess I forget to think when I drink, start to fantasize That you'll be mine And I don't know why I don't know why  I'm addicted, should listen to my friends To a dickhead, again again again I'm addicted, this shit just never ends To a dickhead, again again again  Show me your guitar, started strumming in the dark and you said I was your wonder wall We're never gunna last but I keep on coming back Such a sucker for your booty call  I do this every time I guess I forget to think when I drink, start to fantasize That you'll be mine And I don't know why I don't know why  I'm addicted, should listen to my friends To a dickhead, again again again I'm addicted, this shit just never ends To a dickhead, again again again again ah  You don't own your shit And you diss your mom You give me advice, how to write my songs  You don't leave a tip Always need a ride You just can't commit And I don't know why  You don't own your shit And you diss your mom You give me advice, how to write my songs  You don't leave a tip Always need a ride You just can't commit And I don't know why  Turn it up  I'm addicted, should listen to my friends To a dickhead, again again again I'm addicted, this shit just never ends To a dickhead, again again again again ah I'm addicted, so addicted  P.S. This song is so fun with such catchy beats!!! Tysm Devon Cole!! 💃🏻🎸🕺🏻 Source: https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/devoncole/dickhead.html
You rocked charlotte cardin's  show yesterday in Trois-Rivières
Tellement bon,  nous vous avons vu hier à Trois-Rivieres.
I just love her unbridled sass! Keep the fantastic hits coming!
Thought of my ex lmfao 🎉
That ending was familiar.  I think I dated that same kind of dickhead. LOL
Brilliant Song, Amazing Voice!!!!!!
Amazing song and video!  ”Im addicted” to this song! So catchy!
My new daily jam ❤🎉
It is the best song in 2023 in my opinion! 🙂❤️❤️❤️
My daughter whose 25, the other day played your song W.I.T.C.H.. How profound a song this is to be out in the light of the public,….hahaha, good job! Whoo. Those of us females who are generation exeRs are  pleased! A much needed lyric to come out into the open to be heard by many. Your generation rocks! We appreciate you so much.
"You don't leave a tip"  Drop his ass.
Music you hear in the mall
❤❤❤
Funny how they keep deleting my comment just cause I said there are a few  similarities with "Bullet" by Katy Perry.
Go girl!  Every song is better than the next mama!!!!!! xooxoxoxox
I want Devon Cole and Chappel Roan to make music together. I think it would slap so hard the world would explode.
I just love this kind of musicvideos..:) Thx, so much for u make one smile and laughing..:)
çok akıllısın! anlaşılan kafan iyi çalışıyor!benimde kafam iyi çalışıyor!
Is no one going to mention the sly double entendre she snuck into that hook?
🤣
Just realized the dancers were in the Witch video...
Fun...catchy...poppy...cute...sly...dddddancy. Yup.
Love that song ❤
Same with my longtime bf I even live with !!!!!!!
I love when your songs are absolute roasts
Good song. Video seems cheap though. Nice work on the choreography.
I love you ❤
devon NEVER misses!!!!!!!!!! absolute banger.
But Devon! If it's good enough for ducks, it's good enough for me! 😂
Saw them in Salt Lake City!! They were great
What a bop❤
Good stuff deaf uncle
❤Love it
Slaying everydayy gurl!🥳💖💫
Been waiting for this drop since when you first viewed the chorus...
This is true woman music old school yet very today I love  it  every single woman can relate 😂
So YES to the song NO to the clip. I'm not a prude, actually far from it, I just understand how these things work in the industry. Cheers
I liked it. Up until they had a kid dancing in it, with the "d***heads. Mind your Ps and Qs around the little ones. Shame.. I was going to feature this.   Learning curve for you guys.
Amazing 👍🏻👍🏽👍
Yes yes yes. I love this song
There was no need for that Wonderwall call-out to be that real! 😅😅
ALL her songs are super catchy!! love this
Great song! Nice work! I like the boob flash at the end but I especially like that it's blurred and you keep your integrity while being fun!
love this
I love your song!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
I love it!  ❤️
Well this is fun.
With that body, she should NOT be wearing that outfit!
Ugh your music is so underrated!! I love it sooo much
Hmmm the first verse sounds a lot like "Hey cowboy"?  Good song nevertheless 😍
I need the lyrics because I can't understand half the words in the chorus.
Oh My God, this is amazing!!!!!!
Every Devon Cole song is such a banger! Been obsessed with the bridge since I heard a snippet on social media ❤
loveee it!!!!
Hey Devon glad things are going well for you ! greetings from Prince Edward County
This is good!❤
Damn girl. I'm  way too old to head bang to a song 🙆‍♀️ but this has me seriously gently trying to! 🔥💥😚💞
AHHHHHHH I WAS AT THE ANDY GRAMMER CONCERT WHEN YOU ANNOUNCED THIS SONG OMG
Your songs are so much fun!
I made the mistake of marrying the dickhead. Now over 17years and 3 kids later I'm struggling over it all. Heavy sigh 😔😅
I posted three videos with your song but they're not posting on your Dickhead shorts page of videos with your song 😢 I love your music. Keep making your art . LOVE IT! You're INCREDIBLE ❤❤❤❤.  The day you want to sing in the desert, we'll put up a stage just for you ❤. We've got mountains, hotbaths, lagunas, ponds, horses, trails & mile's of space for campers ❤🎉❤🎉
