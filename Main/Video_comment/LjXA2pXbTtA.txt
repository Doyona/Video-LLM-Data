Us wHites should have NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER should of brought them here 😂✊
10:50 You can tell Rick hates when other people do good. No wonder his son una lived himself, karma has her hands full with Rick 😂
Notice how they make it a point not to show Rebeccas booty as she walks away,😆
I have the 7 DRAGON BALLZ... Callo your buddy😅!
The book will never sell
Rick you're a ripoff
Definitely hire that woman who planned to earn 150 and got away with 180 lmao
Pawn stars laugh 😅 because every deal they make its a good deal of a lot of  😂😂 money
Never understand the americans baseball obsession.
A family physician selling a antique dental collectable for $150??
TYRUS RAYMOND COBB WAS THE FIRST LEGEND!! RICK IS CORRECTO. You can tell who doesnt really know baseball and the history... a lot of babe ruth bandwagon fans hanging on his nuts. "He ran ok for a fatman" -Ty Cobb hahaha
Me : I will not take any less than 100 likes on this YouTube comment Rick: I don't think so, your comment is just going to sit on the site, I can't shift it, it's probably not even real. I'm taking all the risk Me : Ok fine, zero likes 😔
There is no such thing as coincidence.  Especially with galactic interstellar knowledge. Only a human could be so arrogant to imagine they could possibly know anything about such things.
expert: "I value this at about $800." Rick: "I'll give you 6 bucks for it. I take all the risk you walk with enough cash to buy a box of cereal."
Those two clowns had no intention of buying that plane
My Pops got the DFC in the AT 6 Texan in Korea. I'm so very proud of him but North Africa and Korea destroyed him and many of my neighbors who I can visit in Arlington. When are we going to stop this madness. Peace
38:00 Chum 😂
Rebecca is so beautifull❤
Any videos a good video when Rebecca shows up
Corey always gives in when hes dealing with a lady.
Jesus don't have to be jesus. He is more than Jesus. He can be something else. I can teach Jesus how to live fabulously and financially free.
Rick -  I brought you the Rosetta Stone.  Best I can do is $200
Rick is really book smart. Love this show. I always learn something new.
No matter whether if the autograph was done in the clubhouse or outhouse, a famous autograph is a famous autograph. These autograph experts are shylocks and gypsy rip-off artists. 😮
It's amazing that Cory was able to get inside and sit inside the airplane, and the tires didn't explode on impact. 😮😂😅
I have. Seen this guy at the pawn shop at least eight times
the autograph expert is Tackleberry
Watch out he is fake
Babe Ruth has to be up there in the list of ugliest baseball players of all time
Has this melon got a warehouse the size of wembley??  Everything he gets is going to sit for a year or more
There is literally a rare book store up the street. Why do people sell books to these guys?
Subways, the sad thing is, there are people that would like to change history books the same thing
22:53  "Apparently, it works".  Corey's perspicuity is brilliant.
England is just a part of  Great Britain , not the whole of it😅
Every signature and coin is the most forged ever according to Rick 😂😂😂😂😂
When Rick say's its going to sit around for a while before it sells isnt the sellers problem its Ricks problem.
17:30 we haven't dominated the skys for over a hundred years. Ww2 Germany invented the first fighter jet and had air superiority
haha.... bearely
Imagine if the white house got huanted
Old book whar ever , but SHE put all her fingerfat on the objekt ???
i never sign anything 2 times the same this is dumb
this air frace guy is a joke
The AT-6 shows manufactured in 1949 (49-3266), so we missed WW2.  Just saying.
It always gets me when people say, it changed history.....History is made not changed.
the acting is so bad lol i love it
AT-6 Texan was a trainer, not a fighter.
Did Rebecca did a tattoo ?
I'll give you a dollar, and I can pay you in cash immediately
Ty Cobb only hit over 400, 3 years in a row, but he hit over 300, 23 years!! ⚾
It's authentic! Ok I'll give you $5.  But he said it's worth $10k! I said $5! Not a penny more. 😂
I think I see Sid Luckman's autograph on the ball too?
Rick might be rich but he has *no idea* how expensive aviation is.
You never brag about what you paid...  It is irrelevant to the value of item you own...
Wonder if Rick ever bought that plane after?🤔
Nothing sits around a long long time Rick 😒 why you have nothing at the pawn shop worth buying anymore
Famous last words from a pawn broker... "I think that's fair"
I think Gary Numan flew that kind of Harvard in a display team 🖤
look i know people like to jk that Rick likes to haggle down and tried to take advantage, that is his job after all.   But i also have to find it amazing how these guys who go to pawn shops always expect to get paid the same amount its worth, i mean the pawn shop has to make its money back too. XD
i will keep the ball, hey does anyone want to buy the ball? xD
I feel like you should smash a Gameboy into up real bad with a hammer in try to sell it for $50 just for a laugh
Rick is right, honestly gems are one of the most rarest items on earth, and they are hard to sell and it's best to sell it to a private buyer or at a auction
Tell Trump.  I get it.
That little cannon is bad
ร้านพี่ซื้อทุกอยางใด้ดีมาก
Rick should have been the next Jeopardy host.  He knows everything.  /s
Hahaha
Book expert: there’s a lot of people who are going to want this Rick shouldn’t have any trouble selling it  Rick: let me lowball you this is going to sit around for a long time
The English always had the brains but never ever had the numbers.
When two similar items come in, Rick tries to get the buy one get one free deal
lol Rick really kept the bracelet from the Viking the Gold one ! 😂😂😂❤
Ted Williams was best baseball player ever.
What happened to the girl with the tattoos 🤔🤫😁
They all tell the price. Before the expert gets called. I would wait till after it’s looked at.
I don't understand this title
Let me get someone down here
Bridge stop trying to cheat the guy it's a rare book you got the money to give to him😮
Oh she's so beautiful I just love her Rick is lucky to have somebody like her❤
1:35 how would Babe do against pitchers of today?
Them: Do you want to make it a large?  Me: 12:15
The airplane guy could easily tweak his voice to mimic Homer Simpson 😂
Great series 👏
Rick get a Cessna SP-172 not an AT-6 lol. The maintenance and storage……. Yowerz
Why is Jessy from BB selling stuff?
Everything he sells is " gonna sit around for a long time".
They should of got the plain
When it gets to the negotiating, Rick always switches to an attitude that’s like “ugh, why did you even bring this in here? Do you know how annoying this is for me?”
When it gets to the negotiating, Rick always switches to an attitude that’s like “ugh, why did you even bring this in here? Do you know how annoying this is for me?”
I'm confused why they blurred out the tail numbers (which is just the serial number) but showed VERY CLEARLY the civil registration number, which is the number you use to identify the aircraft.
I love how Rick always offers to pay them in ‘cash money - $100 bills’ as if the alternative was an IOU or paying them in yen or roubles.
The underground railroad is dumb already school teaches you to think they were saving thousands they only saved like 50 slaves lol
Rebbeca is so beautiful
Legend has it that pilot is still waiting for that phone call
As a kid my uncle would use a cannon very similar to that one He said was hundreds of years old We fire it every 4th of July Very loud and powerful
I got a buddy thats an ex navy fighter pilot lol
Struggles to sell,well don’t buy it then! I wouldn’t sell f all to his shop.
Lesson learned: sell to Corey
The face on the ww2 plane owner when Corey said I bet I can do a good job crashing this thing 😂 16:35
0:14 ty Cobb only had 3 seasons batting over 400
wtf is Rick talking about , nobody except Ted Williams has hit over .400 in a single season 😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Lovin’ the “little bo peep” vibe from Rebecca 😍
Does anyone ever refuse the “expert”?
When they're discussing the plain and he complains about the storage, upkeep, etc., I wish the seller would just say "That sounds like a YP, not an MP. That's the business you're in here."
Rebecca is super fine wtf
Huge case for a magnifying glass😢
So basically babe ruthe dude, stole the from the ol lady
Also I just notices Rick always uses The same line, well you only wanted x amount when you came in here. Well yes Rick but now we know it's worth more, don't be a tacky salesman 😂 it's insulting to the pawn community!
I understand that it's probably hard to get a better bigger prime location (considering it's Vegas) & onsite storage is an issue and you want to make sure stuff is displayed not just stored but man they hose these people down with the same silly excuses 😂
Then, why GO to a pawn shop? There is a world wide internet where you can sell your precious gems. It is not rocket science.
Everything is going to sit around a while
Who needs a hangar? I wanna fly that thing.
A friend of mine was magnet fishing and found a really old little cannon like that  He cleaned it up and fired it and MAAN was it loud!!!!
I'm not an expert negotiator but "can we do... ummmm..... better?" Is not the best technique?
Bro when Rick told the story at first he said 1588, then said 1539 then said 1739 like I don’t think he knows what he’s talking about 😂😂
2:38 If this guy told me hes David Bowie's brother I would believe him.
Rick always uses the excuse it's going to sit around here for a long time. Well, the old man sat around there a long time, and I didn't see Rick trying to low ball him out the door.😂😂😅
I might insist that the Americans in fact didn't dominate the sky for 100 years. It's more like 50 years. Before that it was Germany which took this role and some might say America gained the ability after that time by shipping a lot of engineers to the US via OP Paperclip.
American "football" must be the gayest sport ever.
Drew is honest, I hate Steve Grad😮
5 grand just doesn't seem like it is a real bargain looks like its fake not real
That T-6 was a steal at $145k. Could've flipped that in less than two weeks and made $25k-$30k. Warbirds are an easy sell.
I would love to visit the pawn shop
Baccy is so pretty
That's always the excuse, they are going to sit a while, that's your problem my friend not the customers 😅😶‍🌫️
AT-6 was a advanced trainer, not a combat aircraft $185k is a fair price
Corey is so annoying. Rick, old man and Chum is enough.
Mmmmm becca
Rip offs 🙄
I wish Americans would be aware of the other countries that make up the UK.  IT IS NOT ONLY ENLAND!!!!!   Wales, Scotland, N Ireland also were involved in ALL the history you are talking about..
I know I want market value so I'll take it to a pawn shop? Haha
Those antique dental pliers are really common and only worth about $30. You could buy 10 of them right now for that price online.
The guy with the aircraft didn't walk into your shop,  when out in the wild you pay retail,  it's not the sellers responsibility to house or run it.  It shows exactly how much of scam artists they are.  Entitled and always the victims.  Take your insults and hide away in your scam shop.
Let me walk away so I can tell my monkey to say it's valued at half it's actual worth.  I'll do this over the phone away from you.  Spot the scam artist.  The shop will definitely make money,  scam business.
It sounds reasonable, because it is, so let me offend you by offering a pittance.
This guy is a clown
The underground railroad was not in the south, it was ohio to new york
@ 5:41 did anyone notice Rick’s wearing the Viking gold bracelet he negotiated in a past episode!?
"I'm bummed we got that close and couldn't make a deal" -Rick after not moving a single inch on the price.
Rick is such a low baller. Making more than 50% is taking advantage. I also feel like these so called experts lowball the evaluation on the items.
The “WW2 expert” knows nothing about British aviation and it shows 😂
rick loves saying "its goiing to sit for a long time" about everything
found the baseball card in the dumpster (yeah old lady boxes sure)? He keeps stealing from people, they'll find that guy in a dumpster
rick sounds like a Best Buy salesman trying to sell you an extended guarantee on that super computer he just sold you
this to much of a plan for them
come on , that book is an historical document ,
I feel like the guys who sold the book about slaves in 1850 look a lot like Jeff Bezos with a kittle extra hair😄
Strongest force for over 100 years? I hope this was made after 2019 at least.
It would be a huge benefit having free access to all of these experts because if you had to pay them to look at $700 items, it wouldn’t work.
It would be a huge benefit having free access to all of these experts because if you had to pay them to look at $700 items, it wouldn’t work.
I wont take anything under $5,500, leaves with $1,100 🤣
Man I love this show just bc of the history of items. Like the engraving of the English destroying the Spanish armada in the 1500s. I’ve never even heard of that but know that I know about it, it’s pretty crazy. If only there was a way to see events like this happening or see through the men’s eyes that were there.
Grown up Americans collecting all kind of cards and pay 100 thousand dollars for them!!! We did that when we were 5-8 years old.
Has anyone ever seen on goggle and saw how much certain items r at this pawn shop there is no pawn shop that sells stuff for $5000
Turns out that keeping the item safe in mint condition for 2000 years costs as much as Rick's display case.
People are so predictable.
Id have love to see Ricks face if he said deal 140k
Do a barrel roll!
The football well Corey you need a new bladder go for it
Book = rebacca
The pilot was a bit suspicious he wanted 185 and he went all the way down to 150 and he was willing to service and maintain the plane which is a bit fishy to me
All he ever does is call for an opinion because he doesn't know the price of anything so why own a pawn shop?
It's a thousand years old worth 50 grand best I can do is 100 bucks who else gonna pay you that
Worth 3000 Rick... I'll buy it for 1200 it will sit for a long time. Oké Rick... it sits... doesn't eat and doesn't cost you any money. It just sits
I love how when the experts come in and say this is amazing and I really could see this going into a museum and it’s so rare…. (Rick): this is going to set around a long time so let me give you a quarter of what it’s worth haha
They would all struggle to get 10 bucks for the items if they took them to Les Gold
Corey, you are by far the best negotiator on the entire show but sometimes when it comes to women you are a complete pushover, she easily would have taken 100 bucks for those  pliers
Rick and the boys give a fair deal but most of the customers are just plain greedy That's America for you😂
ever thought about how a football is not actually a ball?
I <3 rebecca
My mom's ancestors were part of the underground railroad. Her maiden name was Brown.
4:24 Can we do better   Rick's laugh 😅😂
He would cut off the bottom of the Ruth photo?
The autograph "expert" on the football obviously plays for the pawn shop.
“So you could give me flight lessons with this plane, huh?”  HE JUST TOLD YOU THE PLANE WAS USED FOR MILITARY FLIGHT TRAINING!!! 🫣
Underground railroad book worth 1200 Rick: I will give you your original asking price of 700 Me: Sorry Rick. You called in the expert. I want 8 and I am taking 8
"negotiable for sure" what a muppet those are great words to start a negotiation 😂😂😂
Hey, it's FAT Michael Cera again!
the autheicator was a fraud..
Pro Tip - Find out what your item is worth before you go to sell it. If you have a very desirable item, you will usually get more selling it yourself. Many people are strapped for cash and when you "need" to sell your item, you are at the mercy of the person with the money you "need".
I agree with the guy who had the 60’s football. That clubhouse mess, is just that. Sign it for real or don’t at all.
The cannon was bomb AF
Yall in the comments don’t like how they do things but here you are watching 😅
❤❤❤
Ty Cobb won 12 batting titles but he only batted over .400 three times not ten.   And the greatest baseball player of all time is Willie May's.
Corey needs to learn manners.   He is dismissive!
Not everything is a joke gentleman. 😂
Dennis was looking like did you really just say that Corey.
Wish Rebecca had a OF
This channel needs more jokes
How was it signed in 1869 when it says the book was published in 1879? You can see it when she shows the book
Don't you dare cut that babe Ruth card, just leave it the way it is  it looks nice the way it is even though there is a mistake.
I really wish they also had eps where they sell some of this stuff i think that would also be interesting
Does it really take extraordinary business acumen, to offer half value for everything that comes  through the door with desperate people? How does one manage such a serious face, while saying " I think that's a fair price". How often have you seen this owner look at the camera and gloat about how people will line up for an item, then in negotioation, tell the customer" I take all the risk. This will take time to sell". This is worthy of celebrity status?
My grandparents use to have a house that was part of the railroad. There was a room up stairs that had a hidden door. You wouldn't know it was there unless you really looked. There was a small room inside that a few people could fit in, like 6 or 7. Too bad that house gor tore down in the late 70's.
Rebecca is my Fantasy Wife in another Life 😅
of course its two different pens. The lady wrote "from" and her name herself and just let Babe ruth fill in the siganture. way easier then to ask babe ruth to do all that . Use your brains
Rick's offer of 140k for the plane was a great offer.
I wouldn’t have settled for anything less than $1,500 for that Babe Ruth signed photograph.
🔥🔥Rebecca is a babe!!🔥🔥❤️👏
He said it be cool if you be in here firing at Nazis only in video games bro those people were crazy brave different times
Why doesn’t a customer ever point out to Rick that the show being so popular will actually bring buyers faster so it won’t sit on shelf for years. Therefore taking that nonsense out of the equation after the expert takes his risk out also!
Well im sure everyone wants what its worth selling but to a pawn shop its not happening... but when you post a price and the pawn shop comes to you there should be a buy at asking price.
A 2k signature, and he lets it go for 1100?  I think I’d try getting the 2k out of it.
Unlike any of u who r only here to see Rebecca i happen to love seeing all of the antique books that come in
❤Rebecca❤
17:31 not exactly for over 100 years tho is it😂
If you like old NFL look up a book By Jackson Michael. Cool video and thanks for the upload.
Everyone on the show is so dumb. They start with the amount they want to get. Everyone knows you start high and meet in the middle.
I think Rebecca it’s Rick favorite expert
Liar found them
Somewhere, someone is complaining that 3 white people are making money off the people involved in the underground railroad
Seems like everything is 'going to sit around a long long time'
How does Rick know all of these dates?
I hate to see Rebecca go, but I love to watch her leave. Cmere sweetness
Sorry Rick. Cobb hit over .400 three times not ten. Way to make stuff up to make a point lol
1:17 Sir I Have Jefferson Nickel History Rare Coin Five Cents 1967 I Like To Sell It 2:36
Rip off rick
Chumlee is the resident nincompoop....
Bit rich for Rick to ask 500 dollars for the underground railroad book but than settled for the original asking price. That's a nasty bit of negotiating and I'm glad the seller called him out on it.
That's not a fighter plane it is a trainer.
thats not a football, thats a rugby ball lol
So where are all the rare gems as said in the title???
Mickey mantle was the best ever
Cancer and died at 26💔🙏🏻
I know it’s a business and sometimes people get more than they asked so an honest business…but the line “this is going to sit here a long time” seems to be said for a lot and the offer reflects that.  And yet Rick and company don’t bat an eye shelling out 6 figures on stuff and keeping some stuff… they are not just “getting by”
Why do they waste peoples times looking at stuff they dont want or is free advertising for the plane?
Seller:  I have the Holy Grail. Expert:  Yup, it's the Holy Grail. Rick:  Yeah, I know it's the Holy Grail.  But I'm going to have build a display case.  And it's going to sit around for a long time.  Grail Knights don't come in every day.  I can offer you, like, $200.
Didn’t Ruth point to Center Field?
Rabbeca is a doll baby
first dude chill af , who,s high?
$145K was a fair price for a 80 YO WW2 fighter plane 🛩️ 🤷
Wow that cant go to 145,000 I would never do business with  They low ball the he'll out of you I don't know how many times I yelled at the phone
Babe Ruth did not sign the inscription but he may have given the signed photo to Eleanor. Dobson .
Soo why is rhe inscription on the lower part in a very similar hand to the signature?
For the record the best baseball player ever was Willie Mays
Trump could have a million show up but they still haven’t removed the machines. It’s amazing how short people’s memories are this is all dejavue from the last election year. Look at Arizona, where’s Kari Lake? Look at Georgia where’s Hershel Walker? Remember Mike Lindell and the millions he spent on election fraud🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️. The Elites can’t have Trump in the White House and they’ll once again find a way to steal this next election.
My great great grandfather was a station manager on the Underground Railroad
They just won't mention that freedom on the underground railroad was in Canada... history being rewritten  by 'Americans' once again.
My great grandpa said he watched that game, he said he pointed about 30 feet from where it landed, which is very close that far away, also said he may have been just warming up lol
Never tell a pawn shop a price...ask them what theyll offer 1st.
$7000 is definitely out the question he knows he’s not getting that offer
He'll have to frame the cannon, and that costs money!
too many oily fingers faded the signatures on the ball
Rick didn't want the plane
I can only do $1 for the cure for cancer, it's going to sit for a long while.
Never set your "gotta have" price with a pawnbroker and never set a reasonable price as your starting point.
Anyone else go Billy Madison when they hear "Spanish Armada"?
Blah blah blah the only reason why rick tells the seller it is goung to sit around awhile is cuz he is going to read the book first yea yea i know the show is scripted
Headsets by David Clark Co. Worcester MA.
Good Luck Rick, :)
This is so rigged
why do these guys go to someone who wants retail and try to get an item for less than wholesale?? Happens all the time
Funny how he mentions that he has an employee that would think the underground railroad sketchbook was about subways. Political figures that Rick supports would have your kids taught that it was about subways.
Mickey Mantle was the best ball player ever!!!
THe best I can do is 50 cents. Sorry I know its worth 5k but thats only on a good day and its going to sit around the shop for awhile. I have to make money too.
@10:45 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I’m rolling on the floor dying THAT DUDE laughed on ricks face when he said “700$ sounds good I only PAID 2$ for it” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 rick said alright good for you 🤣🤣🤣
Rick is a rip off merchant. Some of his offers are ridiculous
16:05 there gonna be hard to sell. Shakes hands with guy. Rick.. Deal... I love these lol
The battle never happened, stop with that nonsense, it was just a bad storm
It is so funny every time rick makes a fool.out of himself when he keeps saying it is fake and the item.turns out to be real
The expert drew is no longer with us he passed away in jail.
Love the fact Drew has a huge briefcase with a magnifying glass and a torch - priceless
Where’d you get it? “I stole it from an old lady I was supposed to be helping and didn’t tell her”.. Rick: Okay, cool I’ll give ya 1,000 bucks for it 🤦‍♂️
There’s a lot of opinions flying around but I can tell you as a career sales guy it’s not easy sitting at the negotiation table especially if you’re inexperienced.  Logic can often take a back seat to nerves and emotions.  Unless you’re a business person or maybe a litigation or contracts lawyer you’re going to be at a big disadvantage going up against a bunch of pawn sharks who make deals for a living.    My advice for anyone selling an item is to do your homework first on the item, don’t share what you paid for it and most importantly always be willing to walk away if the deal doesn’t feel right.  Also you’re not obligated to answer all of the questions asked.  Yes the history of the item and who it exchanged hands with can be especially relevant especially if there was a possibility the item was ever stolen.  But don’t willingly give up information unless it’s directly relevant to getting the deal done.  Information is power in any negotiation.
There was so much the dude could have come back with in favor of Babe Ruth over Ty Cobb.    -Career OPS: Ruth 1.164, Cobb .945 -Career OBP: Ruth .474, Cobb .433 -Career Slugging: Ruth .690, Cobb .512 -Career HR’s: Ruth 714, Cobb 117 -Career Wins Above Replacement: Ruth 184, Cobb 159  Also let’s get into Ruth’s pitching career.  94-46 w/ a 2.28 ERA.  I guess we could compare that to Cobb’s little league pitching stats but I don’t think records were kept on that.    Ruth is the better ball player and it’s not even close.  I know this is so pointless to go into but one of my biggest pet peeves is when people are simultaneously extremely arrogant and ignorant.  Rick could not have portrayed that more in his absolute declaration of Cobb as being the greatest ever and then giving the guy the most smug stare I’ve ever seen.
Fake bid on the plane.
Does Rick even have a pilots license?
'The book' for "The Book Expert" that everyone loves.
The guy that had the football breaks my heart. He should have had them authenticated years ago.
the cajones to tell someone the most desirable baseball auto in history will "sit around for a while"
Thank you Steven and I truly mean that
Her ansesters is  who the slaves were running from she comes from a line of democrats
Drew makes a lot of mistakes.
the whites hundret Years ago , couldn´t write. so nobody knows about them.  In Sharia Slaves are already exist
Hey Rick, what did you have for breakfast?... Im not sure, do you mind if i call a buddy?
"Babe Ruth is the biggest name in sports memorabilia.." -Michael Jordan: "hold my beer.."
That  cannon thing was uber cool.
These experts put Rick in trouble when price increases,  He wants to scratch his head 😂
Rick's good - Cory is an arrogant spoilt kid
If you pay only half value for an item and it cost 1000 bucks and then after a year you sell it for 2000. That's darn good.  If it was in a bank it wouldn't have doubled in a year. So what if it sits? Ain't investing what you guys do? A bunch of guys whining with a loaf of bread under both arms.
These Pawn Star dudes ain't so smart. But the customers appear largely to have been the goalie for the bowling team. How many times does the appraiser value their item at way more then he was asking. Then they try to get retail in spite of dumb they look. Rick whines that an item may sit in his shop for years. He always offers half value for starters then it's on. Cheap.  Dumb. Greedy.
Cash money, hundred dollar bills works every time 😏. I was selling a small boat once. A guy brought cash out of his pocket. I said OK 🙄.
Does the seller just stand there or does he go out to lunch while the "experts" Google the history and value and then pretend they knew it off the top of their head?
I'd buy that hand cannon, that's cool af.
It’s hilarious watching reaction cuts during the negotiations, knowing full well they’re taken out of context. Lol.
I'm here to see comments from Rebecca fandom 😂
Cool video... the canon shooting at the end was disappointing... the editing of the actual firing was pretty sad
You scammed that old dude pay atleast 2300 for a pair of 3000 dollar paintings
Is Rick wearing that Viking bracelet he bought on the show?
As soon as Mathew started talking I got goosebumps. Every word out of his mouth gave me tingles.
This pawn shop must be full of historic  obscure items that never ever sell. At any price. Who wants half of this useless junk?
I think he accepts all these books so rebecca can come in again :D
The dude with the plane!  OMG let that plane go back to the hangar and let that dude pay the bills every month.
Anyone see that guys shirt at 8:43
The more I watch these episodes the more I realize how much people are willing to pay for historical items
I think that any signature without a paper or photographic trail should not be deemed authentic. It feels so weird when an "expert" looks at the handwriting and very bombastically proclaims something to be real. It’s so easy to forge signatures.
Actually the germans dominated the sky, they invented the jet engine while americans still flew propeller 🤣
The Packers OWN the Bears!!😂!!😂
"I gotta have $1,500" "$1,400" "I'll take it", quicker than a blink of an eye. 🙄🤔🤔🤔
I'll pay cash... hundred dollar bills... gets these dummies to agree. 😆😂
Babe ruth signature will sell quick. Rick will start price at 3000 at least
Johnny West abused my sisters Barnie Dolls along with me. She would turn red with rage when I called them Barney Dolls. lol Wouldn't trade that childhood for the world. We were poor but we made do and we had a blast and of course we all went to work when we were young because we didn't like growing up poor.
Mickey Mantle
Pawn shops... Are a legal way to rob you.😂
Those pics I feel are worth more 🤔
I like that signature checking guy. He's real.  On babe Ruth or any he's checked he's straight shooter
I don't like Drew. He just look's fake.
i always wondered where the pro's come from. did they stored them in the basement? :)
Drew, RIP...
After a late arrival into Europe in ww2 there wasnt much left to dominate after the RAF did most of the work, what an asshat
How do you transport thousands upon thousands of Slaves over the most dangerous Ocean on a Sail Boat? Logically think about what I just said.
Nice plane just the stupid stickers off the sides the cam guard stickers look ridiculously bad on the beautiful bird
man, Rebeca is so beautiful.. she looks like she came out from an anime
I'm English so had the Armada drummed in. Though now in Spain, i realise Queen Elizabeth endorsed the british pirates, who nipped Cadiz 3 times until they retaliated. The weather took care of the rest.
No way they are buying a plane. A historic Texan as a trainer? Get real
I have no idea how that guy said "its worth every penny" with a straight face XD
Babe Ruth is going to sit around a while. Yeah, right.
I would have got that plane for an extra 5 grand
Rick looks like a Chihuahua. Hahahaha
The people that hunted slaves were called the "POLICE"
being in the presence of Rebecca is worth more than 1250
Apparently… since up to a hundred thousand slaves made it from the south to the north without… anybody ever seeing one of them… the sarcastic comment was printed in a newspaper saying something like… “obviously there must be an Underground Railroad that we don’t know about…” and that’s why we still refer to it like that. 📰🤓
RIP drew
I love PAWNSTARS
Rick  is a scammer
Came in for $700 got a second opinion from an "expert" bumped to $1200 and offered $500. You decide. LOL.
Love how they show the front of the store and there's no one standing there. Go visit the place, it worse then a zoo. Just freakn nuts, almost worse then going out to the bars
If they didn't lowball everyone they wouldn't be able to buy those flex watches.
Why do I find rebecca the book worm so hot 😛😐
"I was asked to clean some boxes out and I found this in one of them."   Lol. Thats clearly theft. Like unless he asked. Theres no way that Babe Ruth photo was being thrown away on purpose. If asked to clean stuff out for someeone and you notice something valuable (something you want), you ask them if you can have it. You dont assume its on purpose as it could just as easily be by mistake, especially considring it has value.  Hopefully he did ask, but as he explained it, it seems like it took advantage when something was lost in the shuffle.
I use to e enjoy this show, until they were into trump. No wise person or business man would shos themseleves with that thing.
Homie at 16:36 didn’t find that one bit funny 🤣
You can see they didn't hit the target at 40:43 and then just edited it to make it look like it lol
didnt she only save 70 some slaves not thousands?
That cannon is cool , I'd buy that.
chum and the tooth extractor. Would not be surprised if the entire Harrison family has gotten into trouble.
lol you know Rick was talking about Chum with that Underground Railroad book, lol
I still havent figured out, how they hid the smoke, from those locomotives running underground?
I can't stand him actually. Biggest smoke blower and fraud next to Donald Trump.
Every autograph that comes in the shop Rick says is the most forged signature.
I love when say “I won’t take anything under $2,000” then takes $700 😂
The guy with the cannon should have insisted that it got tested. Like Rick said, if it works that adds value, but he sold it without that crucial information, and turns out it did in fact work properly
That airplane looks amazing
With regards to the signed Babe Ruth photograph at the start; Do not (!!!) cut the lower margin down because of the later inscription! Have it framed and cover it with the matting and do more research. The expert’s advice here is no bueno.
25:45 maybe I had too much today but am I the only one who thinks she's hot? 😂
she loves those things herself, she gets horney over these old medical twezzers, i get it though
he dont have someone to look the whole thing over and test the dydtems, dfeffinitly cant buy something like that without these percations, fake, its fake
he wont buy the plane, he never buys this kinda expensive stuff, bullshitter he is
Give  China our children because we're communists
Look, its Terry Garr.
Rebecca has to be the most girl next door hot woman in the world. For her brains and beauty!
I never seen a black guy selling something to rick🤷🏽‍♂
The underground railroad? That's like the Tube yes?
Why has this baseball player got two women's names? He was an early trannie?
What exactly is baseball? It's a girl's game right? Do blokes play it in america?
This thing is gonna sit around a loooooooooooooong time ........................
The first guy couldn’t negotiate for toffee
junk removal theft
i bet ya the only thing you guys dont have is a spaceship!
Je regarde cette émission depuis là côte d'ivoire 🇨🇮 chaque jour je regarde sur Cstar et j'aime beaucoup votre émission j'aime beaucoup Rick ❤❤❤🇨🇮
He always winds up paying less than a 1/2. what a crook
Is this show still fake and scripted??
Then how many books has Rebecca read? And the thing is is she’s so pretty and so conservative looking and classy. Don’t forget she is very based.
❤❤❤
Rebecca at her pinnacle for sure.
That poor guy with the Babe Ruth autograph 🤦‍♂️.  He is a terrible negotiator.  Rick knew he had him on the hook easy.  Guy could have gotten without question $500 more. Easy.
chumlee put the mojo on that one!
Obviously this is just free location free subject matter free actor and no need of buying as usual for many big-ticket items Producers use to dazzle your eyes.
Gcash😂😂😂
The baseball was larger so if that was taken in account.  His records wouldn't stand.
god i hate the lady book expert.....
The football dude was really heartbroken.
Why do you not offer your sellers   70% cash 30% trade.  Shalom Blessings
Chum is pretty D
you guys should also be showing us when you sell items🙃 the old man selling the armada engravings had a good laugh for getting $1400 out of @ $50 he bought both engravings😂WHAT LAUGH DID RICK HAD🤪?
What if the book was about some white guy would that be worth more
Don’t interview the illegals just send them back along with Biden
5:41 Rick is wearing that Viking Bracelet he bought in a previous episode😂😂
15:25 "whats your best price"? .... when you hear that from Rick he's just trying to get you to ARGUE with YOURSELF! Seller gave a price as did expert, its now time for Rick to give his price. DON'T LET HIM FOOL YOU.
The tooth-puller lady is very cute.
That plane is worth big bucks now
Size doesn't matter thank God lol
Yes our dream girl
My best bd gift was a ride in a 1932 biplane open cockpit. I was smiling & laughing during the ride. The pilot said that since I was enjoying it so much would I'd like him to do a few rolls. ABSOLUTELY  !!!!...Rolls and loops. What a blast! It was my 61st bd. Next year was in a glider. Fun, but nothing like that biplane...
Editor deserves a raise for always cutting to the most boring look on the customers' faces when Rick / Corey make a joke and laugh to themselves.
RIP Drew.
500$ is still huge. FJB😢
Corey tends to be more considerate with the offer when dealing with attractive women that come in the shop to pawn their items. I can't hold that against him, though. I'd do the same thing
I wouldn't of took less then $1800 for that Babe Ruth card. And what's Ricks deal with telling people it's going to be around for a while and he has to sit on it for a year?? That has nothing to do with you low balling! Your still going to make money. And these people must be desperate to sell for a low ball price. I like this show but it's ridiculous and Rick is a scammer!
That's crazy a genuine babe Ruth autograph only $1100?!
why chumlee sounds like stalone?
"During WW2 we dominated the skies.".... Dude definitely let his ego overwhelm facts. Lol
Whenever someone says cash money in Las Vegas it's done deal😂
Everything sits around for a long time ..  lol
The mini cannon was so powerful that it burst a balloon.
Dooown at the Pawn Shop!
I miss the Old Man😢
Certain things irritate me so much. One of them is this. Everyone loves to call Steve a scammer, look it up he's had no trouble. And as a guy who collects autographs and I've dealt with many authenticators they're no different than he is. But this video comes on and Drew is there, a guy that has actually gotten into legal trouble for scamming and the comment section is as silent as bob.
As a seller always ask way more than you want. Never think they will pay what you ask don’t fool yourself.  Also ask what will they pay for it before you say how much you want for it… another hack is  send a pretty girl in when chum is working . He bends easy.. big hoss hack get with in 500$ in the deal and he will not loose it over $500 lol.
Greedy people annoy me.
Not sure what season but Rick bought a couple items from a small shop. One item was a hat or helmet of some sort and they negotiated and tthe owner was pleased. Later rick found out it was worth several times more and actually went back to that shop and told the story and gave the guy cash to compensate the difference. Shop owner was surprised and pleased for the honesty. Does Rick have a conscience? LOL Love to find that episode or another like it
Wonder if still could walk in there and be able to sell our used games like b-4 fame?
🎉ROBERTO CLEMÉNTE
*Rick: “Where’d you get this!?….”*     *!!!!????….: “I just found a picture in a magazine this morning, and I signed it.”*
Rick: where did you buy this? Seller: a yard sale. Rick: I am going to rip the hide off this guy.
How many takes did it take to pop the balloon? I bet there was someone with a 22LR that shot it at the same time.
It's funny hearing Trump voters talking about defeating Nazis.
He will struggle soon even MORE. Millennials had the HIPSTER thing going on, in some cases, doofus, and sought after classic items in shops like this. You think Gen Z and beyond would buy, more less CARE about half the stuff and more in this store? Roll the dice again, because you struck out if you think so.
"HEY!!!!! how are you? What ya got goin' on HERE today?" lol
Harrison should start a Chris Hansen routine at this point, lol. Memes galore, too.
"I have to make monnneeyyyyy.....TOO" lol
oh god, these again, lol. Just another lazy afternoon evening with RICK, hahaha "But...ya gotta understand........" lol
Spain?! F Spain.. lol 🇨🇦🇬🇧
F#@% Spain! 🇨🇦🇬🇧
Rebecca gives me pacman fever.
Donald Trump's father was one of 3 people arrested at the first large-scale kkk march in New York City back in the 30's.
No gentlemen you will be flying a Cessna not a Mustang. Baby steps.
Rick is a thief and his excuses for why he's ripping you off or getting old they're not even they don't even make sense anymore
Joe Carter! 🇨🇦
I like it when Rick and his crew go out to see something big like a tank, a plane, or a boat and then just go "well I wouldn't be able to sell this, bye."  LOL
6:57  Rick, you huff and puff on an item in question, you buy it.  Nobody wants your spit on it.
I think the first man is Shane Simpson, in 2015 Law enforcement officers in Mississippi took Shane Simpson, 36, and Autumn Burkett, 25, into custody Thursday in Biloxi.  They say the two are responsible for selling 13 Ruth baseballs to pawn shops across five states.
Ted Williams
Who came here just to see Rebecca ❤ 😊
RIP Drew
Rick acts like everything he buys sits around forever.
Chad looks like he is only after coming out of art college.
Ty Cobb only got 117 home runs in a 22 season long career. Babe Ruth got 714 in also a 22 season long career.
The guy selling the airplane must be pretty desperate if he was willing to let it go for only 150 k
Corey always decides price by what he likes. Not whst everyone else likes. That place bankrupts after daddy retires
All 3 were great players. You won't see their kind again.
Ricky Rich😂..."This is going to stand a long time  in my shop" snd "I'm going to struggle to sell it" 🤣
From 11.10 Rick obviously never heard about English Armada from year later (1589.)
Chad is a Winner
Rick is good for negotiating. Munitions are good for capitulation. This is nothing less than craggy theater ingratiating depravity and monetization of ill gotten gains. Your trash is someone else’s treasure. This is old story.
Rebecca is a fox 🦊
Checks
You know 700 bucks sounds good, I only paid 2 bucks for it 😂. Alright, good for you 😒
I fail to see how it’s the seller’s problem if the item is gonna sit around for awhile. It’s the responsibly of the buyer to flip it and make a little money. If you buy a house to flip it, it’s on you to sell it and make money. Pawn shops are a rip off!
The best I can do is $95 that’s in mostly dollar bills but there’s a few nickels in there but that’s today, walk out of here, today, cash money, today, best I can do, right now.
SECOND
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥LOVE THIS EPISODE SO MUCH GOOD STUFF!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Corey always sounds like he's reading
Rick is a complete SCAMMER 😅
"A pawnshop is a place where forgotten treasures find new homes and where temporary needs meet second chances."
Rick makes it sound like it's a burden for him to even buy something. So he's doing you a favor to low-ball you.
South 🇿🇦 Africa. ❤
We've seen it before, pawnshops never buy airplanes. It's just for show business.
It’s gonna take up room, I gotta have it framed
16:24
If you want retail price, why are you going to a wholesaler? You go to a pawnshop because you want quick cash and not have to do the work of getting top dollar, the time, energy, and effort is worth something.
Fill in the blank. Best I can do is _________
It sometime seems like the Expert gives a figure he thinks Rick should buy at and some give an expected retail price.     Nothing nefarious , just different expectations.
Rick keeps saying they traded Babe Ruth...They sold Ruth, they didn't trade him.
Do you mind if I find someone to lowball it? So I can pay 25 percent its value?
Rick paying the asking price, love it
￼ Babe Ruth was a nasty piece of work if you were a woman but of course no man cares about that.
yo one hour comment
Hi!!
She's holding the tooth extracter upside down........
Everything old is new again...!
Chum and the Old Man woulda seen the value and BOUGHT it........
That Plane was intentionally difficult to take off and land so, once you were able to learn THAT competently, you could fly ANYTHING........
How many people knew Rick wasn’t going to buy the airplane? 🤚
The typical Rickism...  "Ooohhhh... I really want to have that if I can get it for a good price."  Conversation with seller:  "That's going to sit on the shelf here forever, so I can only give you $X dollars for it".... followed by crazy lowball offer... lol
America's first Police Departments were intially established to capture and return escaped Slaves.........
🎉😮😢😢😂😂❤😮😅😅😊😊
I remember Babe Ruth was mentioned multiple in the 1993 film The Sandlot. During the dream Babe Ruth made a physical appearance in Benny's Dream.
I take great satisfaction in seeing the varied strange old stuff that comes through the doors of the pawn shop.  I would have made a good salesman, if only I were more of a people person...
