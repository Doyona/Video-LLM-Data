Idk who says prowess more. The uchiha or bdubs
AirPods are overrated raycon is the real nice stuff
You did it in half a episode so technically Etho spend more time building it
Happy birthday 2 years late
happy (early) 42nd birthday bdubs
Bdubs is 40?!? Lookin' good for it, fella.
16:18 that song reminds me of Garfield
Protagonist is not the bad guy, Antagonist is the bad guy. ;)
Happy Belated Birthday!
Bdubs being sick vs bdubs normally is a entirely different person
5:57 😂😂
Happy birthday bdubs!
Late to the party, but with a future perspective an idea has come to me. If you wanted a more authentic starting horn, you could replace the noteblocks with one of those fancy custom music discs 🤓 as classic as the noteblocks are, I feel hearing the authentic trumpet sound would really improve the experience!
bdubs trapped on the roof of the nether...he walkin'!
THIS IS HALF A YEAR LATE BUT HAPPY BIG 40TH BDUBS!!!!!!!!!!
I'm so excited to see the horse course return and I would weep with joy if we also got Hurtin' Hermits
i guess i missed or forgot about this one, i was so confused how the horse course magically appeared from s8 lol
Hourse Corse looks neat
A little weird, but it's kinda nice that Bdubs includes his sneezes (like the one he specifically cut to in the first episode, and the one from this episode). It's another step of including all the little un-polishes that really keep up the Bdubs Brand of "being approachable and funky while making insane builds like it's nothing".
Scar is a pro antagonist.
Raycons...  No shipping to Australia...
Happy Birthday Bdubs!!🎂
this mans is only 5 years older than me and has a whole family and stuff. meanwhile i here watchin minecraft.
I’m confused. How did that piglin drop so many swords?
When S8 abruptly ended without the horse course being used I was heartbroken!  And when I saw it come back for the charity stream I was ECSTATIC!!  It was epic Bdubs!  Epic!  You're AMAZING!
protagonist = good guy antagonist = bad guy
Sadge, yet another horse lost to nether portals. Watching from after snapshots started releasing, one thing they fixed was the bug of horses almost always suffocating in portals. So hopefully in the next few updates soon that won’t be a worry!
powdered snow is easy to remove with water!
uh... did he mean antagonist?
Happy bee-lated bee-day
3:55 I think you got that backwards, antagonist is bad guy, protagonist is good guy
Listening to bdubs listing off antagonists as protagonists is the reason I live🤣🤣💀
Bdubs, I know you don’t wanna be friends because I’m late in saying this, but happy birthday!!! I hope it was an awesome day. And by the way, today is my birthday. But since you didn’t wish me a happy birthday, I don’t wanna be friends anymore, either. I’ll stay subscribed, though! 😉
No no no no no. A protagonist is not the bad guy, the antagonist is. Protagonist is usually the good guy.
One minute in, and the horse is dead. 😅
Love seeing the Hours Course back! What bdubs couldnt finish during a short hc season, he can and will finish on a very short notice for a Scar Charity stream xD
You’re the Protagonist. The bad guys are the antagonists. They’re agonizingly annoying 😂
Happy birthday bdubs!!!!
Why don't you pour water or shoot flame arrows at the powder snow?
happy birthday bdubs
Antagonist is the bad guy.
Happy late birthday BDubs!
I’m so proud of you 👏
Happy birthday
Happy Belated Birthday B-dubs!!!
This is incredible! When I saw this on another hermit's video I half thought it had been imported with a world editor. You went above and beyond.
When bdubs is afraid of a build then I have no hope xD
Bdubs face normally: 🥹 Bdubs face with the glasses: ☺️
This was one of my biggest regrets from last season, as for many others, so I'm delighted you've brought it back!
This episode gave me university flash-backs with the all-nighter. Loved the horse course last season though so it would be great to see it used!
Protagonist is good guy… antagonist is the bad guy, Bdubs—
You goober bdubs powdered snow is destroyed by water
I loved this course so much! Watching hermitcraft makes me realize there's always different ways to play the game :) You did a wonderful job! I always enjoy ur vids & builds :)
Bring back the flyboys and u'll be the best youtuber in my book.
"Protagonist is bad guy"
ohhh this is fantastic bdubs!!!!!
HOW IS THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE SEEN BDUBS IRL FACE? AND HOW DO YOU SOMEHOW LOOK BOTH EXACTLY LIKE AND NOTHING ALIKE WHAT I WAS EXPECTING!?!
Good work Bdubs.
Bdubs’ horse dying gives me intense flashbacks to Jorgen. Rest In Peace horse
Protagonist is main character bdubss antagonist is bad guy
I dont think Bdubs knows what a protagonist is
If I could, I would double-like this video. :D
Use water to remove the powdered Snow faster
Seeing bdubs use the word protagonist multiple time and then explain it, meaning antagonist, is quite funny.
Bdubs Antagonist is the conflicting force and protagonist is the main character or force
Happy Belated Birthday!
i Hated the fact that the horse course never got used last season after so much went into it so i'm looking forward to it being used this time , great idea bdubs ^^
I am late but never miss! Happy birthday Bdubs 😙❤️
Happy birthday 🎉
Happy birthday
Protagonist or antagonist? xD
If you dump a bucket of water ontop of powdered snow it will delete any it touches
hey b-doublebubble love ya man i don't think iv ever posted a comment but iv been following you since you first Minecraft world. i remember downloading it and being amazed XD oh to be young. anyways man i just really wanted to comment because i miss the b-team i know Generikb will never be back but my oh my you guys were a duo. take care brush your hair and i see you when i see ya PEACE!!! 😭😭
Dude Bdubs, a PROtagonist is the HERO, they are good... like a PRO... ANTAgonsts ANTAGONIZE the PROtagonist, dey bad. You hurted me today :,(
Yay!  I’m excited to see the horse race.
Bdubs use water buckets to get rid of powdered snow!!
yay!
Happy birthday Bdubs
Of course Bdubs is the best! He is unbeatable! If anyone had a chance it would be Etho but even Etho cannot truly compete with the real, untethered bdubs power!
I know the charity stream is on Sunday but at what time?
I know the charity stream is on Sunday but at what time?
Etho did better because he did his game and designed all the Redstone for your game too....
Hey Bdubs tomorrow is my first show jumping competition so I really enjoyed it while making the course
You can use a bow on powdered snow, it breaks all the blocks the arrow travels through (I'm not sure if the flame enchantment is needed, it might be)
Even though this is late, happy birthday Bdubs!
So glad the horse course is back! 🤩
you can use flame bows to clear powder snow quickly if they didnt remove the feature;)
I see BDubs also sings when he is on the verge of a mental break down. Nice. Love the Horse Course!!!
etho's game isn't floating bdubs! Hope ya feel better before sunday and happy belated bday good sir.
Happy birthday!!! (It’s a Bit late but the good vibes are still valid)
My favorite protagonist is Lex Luthor.
happy birthday bdubs!
antagonist is bad guys
Happy belated Bdubs
B dubs I love you but someone should tell you; Antagonist= bad guy protagonist = good guy 😂😂😂
protagonist -> antagonist
Happy birthday
it looks like most of the hermits have trouble understanding "mini" games XD I wonder what would a giga game looks like. Those mini games are all so incredible
welp, guess the season's gonna be over pretty soon…
Happy late birthday!!
suggestion for the little floating swiftness dispensers: make them look like quad-copters
Yo bdubs happy 40th. Been her for +10years. A lot has changed in your building and video quality. I'm excited for you. Have a happy one John.
Does Bdubs know what a protagonist is? No.  Did Bdubs defeat the antagonists? Absolutely.
Happy late birthday Bdubs!!
Happy belated birthday!!
protagonist is good guy, antagonist is bad guy
Happy Birthday!
Water melts through powdered snow 🥰
Happy belated 40th. Midlife bdubs with pre-midlife energy.
2:31not the first time I've thought this but do the Hermits know what a "mini" game is?? XD
happy Birthday bud!
I almost don't want the hermits to do the race on the horse course, so Bdubs can build it again in s10
water destroys powdered snow real quick
Happy birthday 🎉
Beautiful belated birthday, Bdubs!
Good lord he's old!!! Most youthful 40yr old on the planet
I'm so excited to see the horse course in use!
Protagonists is good guy
Happy birthday!
I love that you brought the horse course back, I was so sad when nobody got to play it in season 8, my biggest season 8 sadness
Actually antagonist is the bad guys lol you're the protagonist
What’s the mod he uses to enhance mob animations
Did anyone use the one from last season
I think bdubs mixed up "protagonist" and "antagonist".
Poor Bdubs... wash the powdered snow away with water or get rid of it with fire... Even fire arrows could work. :C
Hello I am a new fan . my parents Runway to Australia and had another child, leave a like to make them come back
Glad to see the horse course back! I always wanted to see it played with a bunch of people.
Less than 2 minutes into the video and we see a major reason that horses are an unviable method of transportation. Not even just suffocating in the wall, but like the average horse speed is 9.7 blocks per second, while the fastest horse is 14.57 blocks per second. But if you think you're getting one that fast, good luck. It'll take hundreds of tries because the baby isn't always better than the parents. They had to introduce randomness into the breeding. It's so frustrating. And the camel is slower and I believe they already confirmed it won't have storage
Bdubs… protagonist is the hero.. antagonist is the enemy..
Commercial bdubs has Jeff Goldblum vibes
Happy birthday!
"I even did his own redstone by myself" -Bdubs, 20:58
I got the fitness raycons and they have little tabs that make them REALLY secure
I believe you mixed up protagonist and antagonist. Antagonist is the bad guy, you are the protagonist.
Major props on getting that all done in 1 episode
you can easly get rid of powded snow with water
I'm glad you're feeling better Bdubs. I hope your recovery will be complete soon. See you at the event. With the guests coming over from Empires, this is going to be even more fun. 🤠👍
You can destroy powdered snow using a water bucket. Hopefully this helps next time you have to get through some!
Bdubs is the Might Guy to Etho's Kakashi
Protagonist? Or antagonist? 😅😅😅
Bdubs please fix the issues with the patreon discord server.
Happy Birthday Bdubs!!!
I dont mean to be a dick but the protagonist is the hero of the story you mean ANTAGONIST (as in Luke is the protagonist, darth vader the antagonist)
Antagonist not protagonist... I'm turning into THAT commenter, I'm sorry
Now he just has to breed a hundred horses 😂😂
Bdubs you need to sleep and get better your cough sounds like a guardian at 21:24   There's no competition by the way I've learned more about redstone from you than any other minecrafter.
3:54 Sorry, bud. Protagonists are good guys. Antagonists are bad guys.   Well, technically, protagonists are the main character of a story or a champion of an ideal, antagonists are the things preventing the protagonists from reaching a goal
Prowess
Water clears powdered snow. It’s a great life back. Lol
Poor Bdubs, all the YouTube in the money in the world and still not enough to afford a dictionary to look up protagonist.
Happy birthday old man!
Make a game for the charity event in one episode. The new war in Hermitcraft.
water the powder snow
protagonist is definitely not bad guy bdubs X) thats the antagonist
Happy Belated Birthday then!😎👍🏼 🙏😇✝️ Many Blessings for you and yours!!
Awe 😭 Happy Birthday dude I've never met but is super funny and makes me laugh all the time! 😂🥳
Silly bdubs. Protagonist is good guy
6:53 A lava arrow or flame bow would've worked wonders there... **Laughs in total chaos' destroyed walls**
wait isnt protagonist the good guy
1:10 this just gave me some mad flashbacks to pewdiepie’s mc let’s play…
I am soo impressed with your horse course.  Loved it ❤
Um bdubs. Protagonist is good guy. Antagonist is bad guy
the horse course looks wonderful!!
The protagonist is  the main character the antagonist is the bad guy
I always thought it was antagonist
Antagonist
Silly BDUBS, PROtagonist is the main character, ANtagonist is the bad buy! Antagonizer is villain just as protagonizer isn’t a real word :P
When breeding horses, you can use a speed potion on them, then breed them. the resulting Baby horse will be faster. You can give the babies speed potions and when they grow up and the resulting horse will be even faster yet.
:07
22:24 wait…. AGAIN?
Happy belated birthday B-Dubs
I's the "let's play unfinished proyects" minigame district and I'm all here for it
Today I learned that Bdubs doesn't know the difference between a protagonist and an antagonist
Tell Etho you win:  you both made use of previous builds, you both completed your builds in one episode ... but you did yours while sick.  That's true dedication.
I love how bdubs keeps saying protagonist instead of antagonist.
Bdubs, as someone who is not your friend, happy belated birthday!!!
protagonist is good guy antagonist is bad guy  for future reference Mr. Bdubs.  love ya
happy birthday!
happy birthday king
Happy Belated Birthday Bdubs! Sorry I didn't wish you happy birthday sooner. Hope we can still be friends
Antagonist is the bad guy, the protagonist is the main character
You ought to look at some Hunter Jumper courses for reference if you ever build the horse course again! Could be some very good inspiration :)
"If you're not using TNT... You're a sucker!"
Get well soon! Also antagonist*
Antagonist is bad guy bdubs
But... Iskall made Mend and Go, not Keralis?
Antagonist is bad guy. Protagonist is good guy
Hapi late borfdae!
Raycon earbuds are decent for what they are, but the audio quality lacks in some places. I'm happy I got a bit of a discount thanks to BDubs!
Well... Etho had an original game idea... You reused your essay from last school year...
protagonist is the good guy bdubs, antagonist is the bad guy!
Horses are good, what about donkeys or pigs? Smile😋😋
Excited to see this get use. It really is beautiful a
Much respect, bdubs. That was a grind and a half, and it looks phenomenal!
happy late bday bdubz :)
Bdus I love you but I think ....
A Horse killer
"protagonist is bad guy for those of you who dont know"  the nerds in the comments: "well actually... the protagonist is the the leading character or one of the major characters in a play, film, novel, etc. Like spiderman. Antagonist is the "bad guy" of the story and in other words is a person who actively opposes or is hostile to someone or something; an adversary. Lke the joker hence you are wrong and what u mean to say is antagonist instead of protagonist everywhere u said protagonist"
Moon looks big?!?!
Happy birthday Bdubs. I did actually buy the raycon work earbuds because I do teletherapy 8 hours a day. Best decision I ever made. Also, love the horse course revival!
Yeah! The horse course will arise again! It will be fun to see it get used more this time around.
Happy Birthday Champ!
Foreshadowing the end of HC: S9?
So impressive to do it in one episode while sick! Take care, happy birthday, and know you're amazing!
Happy birthday Bdubs! You're just about the only YouTube person that I would likely thank for making videos and being part of my life. Feels like yesterday I bought the gold foil Survivalcraft shirt!
You ask who's cooler for there respective courses - you or Etho. I put to you BDubs, that considering Etho built the OG horse course alongside you and was just as sad as you for not getting the opportunity to play it, I'm going to say you both win (but really Etho wins, it's always Etho)
looks amazing! can't wait for everyone's charity streams!
Wow Happy (belated) 40th!  Hope you're feeling better soon.  Can't choose between you and Etho sorry, but well done on the redstone working.
bdubs: oh noo! my horse died from portal suffocation. pewds: first time.
When you come out with the bdubs clock then maybe we will consider you for maybe 2nd behind etho
So glad you fixed Etho's crummy redstone! 😤
It is back! I cant wait to see it in use.
Hahahaah bdubs confidently misusing protagonist is just perfect!😂 Does this mean he's the episodes true antagonist?? 🧐😆
1:12 save a horse, ride a cowboy 🤠
see  classic BDubs  with no castle hammer stuff coming down from king ren,   this is the BDubs i missed seeing!!
Libra nation!  Plus, I just hit that 40 year milestone as well.
takes months to plan and build originally, Season 9 does it in 1 episode lol what a guy
Happy Belated Birthday Bdubs!
another great episode!!!!!! welcome back!!! glad you're feeling better, although you still sound a bit.. horse
antagonist is bad guy
Whelp this server's about to die. Etho built an arena, and B-Dubs recreated the horse track.
tfl when you are not bdubs's friend because you didn't know his birthday ☹️
You know what else is better than a new youtube video from bdubs? it's when that video is sponsored lmao
B-dubs you are always the coolest.... On your videos 🫢
Happy birthday Bdubs  The horse track is beautiful glad you brought it back
Your sponsorship clips are the only ones I don’t skip.
The amount of work you put in is incredible. I'm so glad to see the return of the Horse Course. And your singing was just *chef's kiss*
If protagonists are bad guys, what do antagonists do?
Bdubs being proud of his redstone feels so good to watch. Especially since I get it—I’ve been working on weird Redstone myself and when it works it feels sO GOOD
Impressive glad to see the horse course back can’t wait to see the race
I think your horse escaped at the start of the vid by standing on the pig! What an amazing build the horse course is! And you got that donkey to do such a big jump! 👍💐🏆🥇❤️
Bdubs should be doing pro voiceover work...
HOIMYCRAFT
Bdub's You are a mad genius. Well done I am excited to see the resurrection of the horse course!
Who’s gonna tell him that protagonists are the ones you root for? Antagonists are the ones you root against…
Happy birthday 💕🍰🎉
Happy belated birthday Bdubs. Hope you had a wonderful day.
these Elden ring inspired designs are top tier... diorite really adds to the emersion.
All that in one episode, _while sick..._ Hermits are just built different, man.
Antagonist 😋
HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY BDUBS SORRY TO HAVE MISSED IT HOPE YOUR WEEK IS AWESOME /pos /g
“Protagonist is bad guy”  Spoken with such Confidence T-T
I thought this was a s8 reupload. I just realized it said s9 at the end. Sorry Bdubs :(
Bdubs: if you have not wished me happy birthday you are not my friend Me: then I have nothing left
this man aging like fine wine bro damn
I was kind of sad to not see the horse course ran, so i am happy now to see it back
Bdubs would always be the best but the king a ss licker kinda bugs. You got a king because of ugly pillars. But now the server is full of huge ugly signs and bs. It's much worse now. Plus emeralds as diamonds is much more broken than just having a handful of rich hermits
Oh he gamin’
I absolutely love watching bdubs I've been watching a lot of your old bteam videos. Amazing work
Get well soon BDubs. That was a grind! Hope everyone enjoys the horse course and rooting for a succesful charity stream for you all. ❤️
I think you mean antagonist
The horse course kinda savage🔥 wit the tunnel
Happy late b day 🎉🎉🎉😅😊
The entire horse course in one episode, while feeling sick... I salute you sir Bdubs! Now please go get some rest and feel better <3
I love bdubs slowly losing his sanity
Happy late birthday. Sorry i missed it
I don't remember seeing a Crastle at season eight's Horse Course, but it certainly is a nice touch! 👍
The horse course returns! Awesome!
Happy belated birthday, bdubs!!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!🎂🥳
Etho game is beter
hey i turned 40 this year too, happy belated
7:30 you could just use water, it instantly destroys powdered snow that it touches.
Oh no! The moon's coming because a Horse Race Course might actually be used for once on HC! (I jest).
You can be the best Bdubs but Etho will always be OG.
"I even did HIS redstone... By myself " 😂😂😂
Says he made a better mini game than Etho but had to use Etho’s redstone to do it
Horse Course!!! 🥰 Hope you feel better Bdubs. 💕
Antagonist, not protagonist. You yourself are the protagonist in this story.
I looked at the thumbnail and thought i was trippin!
A big wonderful Happy Birthday Bdubs. Hope it was a very special day for you. Hugs
I can't bereve your prowers! 😍 Amazingly done! 👏❤️
I‘m not Bdubs friend 😢 I thaught we were all his friends
Antagonist = villain. Protagonist = hero. ~_~ooo
HAPPY 🎉BIRTH DAY🎈
Bdubs, you should do Ovaltine radio commercials.
so pleased to see the horse course back, it was cursed with the etho/bdubs build curse last time.
Antagonist is the bad guy not the protagonist. Lol
Not Ather Horse Course 😑😑😮‍💨😮‍💨😵‍💫😵‍💫
Im so happy to see the horse course is back! Biggest tragedy of s8 was that it went unused!
Happy belated birthday BDubs!
lol - wonderful job - butI think you meant to say 'antagonist' rather than protagonist.
Hello WElcome to moinycwaft!
Happy belated birthday!
ANTAGONIST is the bad guy. Protagonist is the main character. You’re a wonderful creator Bdubs ❤
Awesome Episode! Love the return of the course! You could call it Horse Ofcourse! :P GG on smashing it all out on one day, and I wish you a happy birthday :)
well bdubs grasp of english explains a lot
happy berthday mossey b!
HaPpY 40th!! 😊 Have missed seeing your nutty episodes due to your being sick. But Wow! this more than made up for it!! KUDOS for creating while still ill, that ain't easy I know. Looking forward to seeing this in action along with the rest of the Charity Event.
Bdubs: "Remember when I made that Horse Course? Want to see me do it again?"
seeing the horse course stuff come back makes my heart so happy 😭I was so sad that season eight ended like it did, I'm so ready.
damn i hope i look that good when im 40
for future reference you can get rid of powdered snow just by placing water on top of it!
Woah! Amazing, Bdubs!
Protagonist = Good Guy Antagonist = Bad Guy
Happiest of birthdays (I did wish you on your actual birthday on the twitters because I am friend), DBubbles...and welcome to 40s!! Rejoice in knowing that you can mature and grow without becoming crotchety and old!! I’m excited to see what God has for you in this new season, and to witness you encourage and inspire so many by being the you that was meant to be before the earth was even set on its foundation!!  You are a treasure!! Also great vidjah can’t wait to see you play the horse course with the Hermits!!
“I even did his own redstone by myself. Prowess.” You’re the best bdubs! Happy birthday!
Bdubs, try using water to destroy powdered snow
Pretty sure ‘Antagonist’ is the bad one Bdubs 😉
Protagonist is in fact not bad guy
Who’s gonna tell him that protagonist definitely does not mean bad guy? I believe the word you were looking for was antagonist
Bedubs has such a Chad face and such a nerdy voice, but somehow it all fits together so perfectly.
Protagonist is good guy and antagonist is bad guy*
Happy belated Birthday. Looking forward to the streams on Sunday!
Happy belated. I turned 40 this year too, woo ‘82!
Happy late birthday Bdubs! So happy you get to work on the horse course again! Looking forward to it!
3:55 Protagonist is the main character in a story, antagonist is the "opponent" of the protagonist, often referred to as the bad guy.
1:15 "it's ok, the game is new, only has 11 years, a very annoying thing like this probably will be fixed in the next patch, right?..."
Imagine he says Welcome to Homiecraft.
Make sure you light up the build bdubs
*@BdoubleO100* 10:04 The "Crastle" (9:42) do NOT make it exactly as it was, make it look older, maybe even be a ruin (saves time too)... The point is that TIME has moved on since last season, and since everyone has been "gone" (annihilated by MoonCrash...) for so long, the structure has deteriorated since then :D If possible, please make the surroundings also look "older" than in the previous season, maybe burnt/destroyed/blasted too (from MoonCrash), to REALLY sell this idea about time :D (Or maybe, make it look like this entire "chunk" of the world got blown off-world by MoonCrash & crash-landed in this season after a long while in space?)
Happy birthday 🎉🎉🎉
Awesome episode Bdubs! Hope you start feeling better.
Etho the best xD
I had to triple check it was a new episode ngl
"Protagonist is bad guy, for those of you that don't know." Umm... B-Dubs, I have some bad news for you.
Yeah you won...
it's a little late now  but you can use water to wash away the powdered snow
Apparently all protagonists are bad guys, good thing im a side character at best.
Bdubs vs Etho is always my favorite lmao
happy birthday for then
Happy late birthday Bdubs!
You can always shoot flame arrows from your bow to clear out a bunch of powdered snow if needed!
"Protagonist is bad guys" just further proves that Bdubs is indeed on the evil side of Hermitcraft. The B Team is back!
20:00 Etho is the best and did the coolest thing which is cooler than your thing
FYI protaganist is not bad guy, it is "the primary character of a story", whereas antagonist is "the primary character that opposes the protaganist." Most stories are told from the perspective of the hero, so protaganist is often "good guy", but it is not required.
antagonist
happy b-lated birday!
AWESOME to see the Horse Course again! Better than ever!
Happy late birthday
I didn't think the end of the seen was coming so soon
Just FYI antagonist is the bad guy protagonist is the main character.
It's Antagonist you mean Bdubs, not Protagonist.
Can't you use water to break powdered snow? Would make that tunnel area faster to clean out if you still wanted to.
How thankful i am that you revived this build. I was itching that this was discarded after that short season
Bdubs.. protagonist is good guy. Antagonist is bad guy.
Imagine the Charity event and the Hermits run out of time and don't use the Horse Course..
Happy birthday bdubs!!! Thanks for the like btw
<Etho> I made my whole battle royale minigame in one episode! <BDubs> I made my whole horse course minigame in one episode...WHILE SICK! ON MY BIRTHDAY!
Protagonist = good guy Antagonist = bad guy
Wow, the course is exactly the same as the previous one, this is really impressive, especially considering you did in one episode what took so long originally, and while recovering from being sick! What a commitment! Wonderful job, and it makes quite a nice throwback along with the carwash being a nod to the gas stations!
Imagine this course, but with camels!
Happy Birthday! Welcome to the old man club. You are now officially allowed to yell at children to "Get Off My Lawn!"
I just looove etho
:cough: Bad guys are ANtagonists. The protagonist is the hero of the story.
No one tell him protagonist is the hero of a story and that the antagonist is the villain. Let him have this.
Love that you’re bringing back the Horse Course!
Protagonist is the good guy.
the protagonist is the leading/main character, the 'antagonist' was the word you were looking, they're the bad guy
Antagonist is the villain
You know how they say: Even if your voice is a little hoarse, there's never a bad time for some horsing about.
You could use the powerded snow at the sides
Happy birthday!!!
Thanks for interesting video.
It’s not impopsicle bdubs! Even though it was a rough start!
Protagonist = central figure Antagonist = bad guy  😉
Im super excited that the Horse Course is coming back. I was sad I didnt get to see anyone play it last season.
So glad the horse course makes a return and will get used this season!  Excited to see y'all race!  Get well soon, BDubs!
Me cringing whenever Bdubs saysthe protagonists is the badguy. T^T my poor writer heart
Protagonist is good guy antagonist is bad guy bdubs
Bringing it back is exactly the right decision! :D I try not to Like too many videos but with this effort+result it would be a crime not to!
so excited to see the horse course back and knowing beforehand that it'll actually be used!! happy late birthday, bdubs!! <3
I think this was great, but do not compare yourself to Etho, or even compete. Ethos episodes are some of the most boring melancholy on YouTube, but he is the only YouTuber I will pull my car over to watch. Bduds are the most exciting there is on YouTube. Loved your episode.
is a shame that s9 is going to end before the 23 but... well good season overall
"Protagonist is bad guy" uhhhh sure.  I think you mean antagonist.
21:21 this sounded suspiciously like a horse...
Seeing the horse course come back in season 9 has truly been one of the greatest joys in a while. I always tried to imagine what it would look like seeing the hermits compete. Now we will know for sure. Thanks for soldiering through!
missed ya, BDubs! glad you're doing better, best to you and your family!
Wrong season , Bdouble
Protagonist is a bad guy lol please don't become a teacher
I’m so happy you built the course! I was so bummed you guys were not able to use it last season.
Oh I'm so happy to see the horse course get a new lease on life in this new season. You two worked so hard to make it, so it's so nice to see it again.  Good job bdubs!
Maybe somebody should start selling moon insurance. You know, no reason..
Just put water on the powdered snow to clear it
I love the lore building at the beginning when you said "Protagonist is the bad guy"
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BDUBS, LOVE YA
I’m so happy the horse course is back. I was sad we didn’t get to see it in action last season
If the 1.20 update adds camels you can make a course for camels
As someone who is new to your channel for this season it was very nice to see this and look forward to seeing many races in those tracks.
I’m super excited to see the Horse course back!! I was so sad when it didn’t get much use out of it in S8. You did beautiful Bdubs! I can’t wait!
Horse course horse course horse course!!
I like the serounding more than last season, eventhough you had to dig quite a lot you did a wonderfull job. I really am looking forward to sunday to see people race this course, the moon cant stop it now right?  Besides that hope you will get better soon hearing your cracking voice while you record this sounds bad, thea honney and a bit of rest.
Well done Bdubs can’t wait to see the race live it’ll be like the Grand National 🎉
So glad the horse course will actually get played! It looks fantastic and inspired me and my friends on our SMP!
if u use fire arrowns in these snow blocks you can break they
Powdered snow is so slow? TNT sits in the corner being sad.
Bdubs rebuilding the horse course isn’t gonna help stop confusing season 8/9
You should randomize the potions so just when you think its swift, ha its slow! Lol
16:12 “We keep going until we get her done for Jerry.”
omg, that commercial was a piece of ART lol
well, between you and etho, obviously you win at redstone contraptions.
Let’s watch some hormeycraft
He needs to build a stable
He mixed up protagonist and antagonist!
erm.... protagonist is the hero. the good guy, the word youa re looking for bdubbs, is ANtagonist. the bad guy, the villain. that aside. love your content. slay on
Mr. Bdubs I’m glad you worked so hard on bringing the horse corse back! It’s for a wonderful cause and I’m so excited to see you and the other hermits horsing around!
hey Bdubs when 1.20 comes out, maybe you can make it 2 player using camels1
happy late birthday Bdubs ! also "protagonist" doesn't mean bad guy but main character, bad guy is "antagonist"
Isn't protagonist the main character and antagonist the main bad guy?
Protagonist is the main character in the story. Antagonist is the bad guy.  BdoubleO100 is the Protagonist of this story. Everything else he considers the Antagoist.
The passion shown here for charity is a beautiful thing. The time and effort put into this is amazing. Also glad to see that the horse course will get to see some action. I am definitely planning on being a part of the event 😊
Bdubs, get well soon!
Fr tho this episode is hilarious. Bdubs is hilarious and I'm sooo grateful that we all get this entertainment for free.
Happy belated level up day Bdubs.
Omgggggg happy birthday sweet face bdoubleo100!
Omgggggg the fandom better donate as much as they can. my heart is so touched that you had to rebuild the whole course all on your own.
Omg are we actually going to see the hermits play bdubs and etho baby???
i think you mixed up protagonist with antagonist bdubs xD
I'm gonna cry! I loved season 8 so much! And I've always been sad to think that the horse course wasn't used. Thank heavens that Bdubs is bringing it back. My heart is melting and I'm so excited for the charity stream!
3:55 Bdubs, protagonist is the main character/good guy, antagonist is the bad guy. Not the other way around EDIT: while at first I thought you a fool, I now realise differently. I fell for your ruse, and commented a correction to your error, as was intended in your scheme. It seems then that I was the fool, and you were the fool who fooled the fool (who is me)
You can remove powdered snow with water
You absolute madlad!
Bdubbs… do you sleep??
1) Belated happy birthday. 2) No, I'm not your friend. I'm some random stranger on the internet who likes to watch your videos.
congratulations 🎊 👏 💐
Whenever I hear bdub singing anything, 'fly me to the moon' gets stuck in my head
Happy B'day Bdubs!! 💖
Bdubs, a protagonist is a good guy, an antagonist is a bad guy.😂
"Protagonist is bad guy for those of you who don't know"  My literature major heart is sad today.
The Horse Course was my favourite build of yours last season.  I was just like, "I would never even _think_ to use a pallete like that."
Not throwing shade, but protagonist is good guy (main character), antagonist is bad. The easy was to remember is antagonist antagonizes, PROtagonist is positive.
This video has been in my recommended and i didnt watch it because i thought it was the old one…
Is it in upgrade? Or more a building shortcut xD
I know I'm late, but anyway, I hope you had a good and a happy birthday!
You mean antagonist...
Happy Birthday Bdubs!
Happy birthday bdubs!!!
Salute to you, grind-bdubs! o7
Bdubs member when you built a whole mountain in one episode and made it seem like it was no big deal? And now where you're sick even this seems like a big deal, because all of it is actually😂😂😂😅
_“Protagonist is bad guy, for those of you who don’t know.”_  Sounds like Bdubs has been watching a lot of She-Hulk lately. And Rings of Power. And Breaking Bad.
At i first i saw the thumbnail, "Did i seeing thing, it is hermitcraft season 9 right?"  Then watch the episode, Bdubs you absolutely a madman bringin back the horse course
Watching BDubs go through the finished horse course… it’s so cathartic. My heart is healed.  Season 8 ended so … abruptly. It HURT with all the unfinished projects everywhere. And this - this was one of the big ones I cried about. They never got to play it.  But he did it! He rebuilt the entire thing, complete with Ethos redstone work AND a whole frikan castle. Plus there’s some bits that look more polished than they were. He did it. And they’re going to play it.  They’re going to get to play it… I’m actually about to cry again.
*Antagonist=Bad Guy*
I am beyond excited for the horse course!!!
You better have hermits betting diamonds on the horse races
You win this! so nice to see the horse course again!
Happy birthday!
Happy belated birthday BDubs! I hope you feel better soon. It's so great to see the horse course again and to make the S8 throwback complete it would be great to see the boatem crew race it with their company cars. Maybe not for the charity event if Mumbo can't make it, but if he's back before the end of the season, I would love to see that!
Good job mannnnn impressive work
Hey Bdubs loved the episode and glad to see the horse course will be used this time and hope you get better soon and dish out more of these wonderful episodes
RIP Horse
2:04 Bless you
Happy birthday 🥳 🎉
Antagonist is bad guy. Protagonist is the person at the centre of the story
Happy Birthday BDoubleO
Protagonist is good Antagonist is bad
Just hearing BDubs say 'horse course' over and over is enough for me. He doesn't even need to finish it.
Welcome to the club Bdubs I turned 40 a couple of weeks ago, and went and did my 1st ever escape room with some friends I hadn't seen since before lockdown started it was a doctor who themed one and was a lot of fun, then we went for Chinese after
well... hoping your sponsorships make you tons of money.  But it's boring me.
Belated happy 40th birthday, not-friend-but-person-I-enjoy-the-YouTube-videos-of and neighbor (in the general everyone is my neighbor sense of the word)!
guys i dont think bdubs knows what a protagonist is
You did great even sick you can still kill it. Keep it up buddy 🤘🤘
Protagonist being the bad guy shows how much Bdubs is overloaded with Scars Disney Stories that he sees the Antagonists as the good guys 🤣
Powdered snow can be removed instantly with water. 12:43 to skip the ad that you can't even skip with Premium. Thanks for not much YouTube.
Hermitcrafters do ads so well
Horse course! Horse course! Horse course!
protagonist is actually the good guy, antagonist is the bad guy. It has the word antagonize in it. (and anti)
Bdubs 2021: hermitcraft Bdubs 2023: hoyuyuaaee
"Protagonist for those dont know is the bad guy!" EXACTLY! That's why ren is the heroic antagonist in this arc 😆
Willingly falling into your antagonist comment trap.😁
🎉Happy Birthday!  I love your voice so much you’re the only one who I actually watch COMMMEEERCIAL break for! 🫶🏻🫠
Sow... I think the best are all the hermits making their amazing videos and inspiring me. Be it etho with his cool castle structure or a freaking cool horse course. I love them. <3
HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY WISHES BDUBS !!!!
Happy birthday! :3
Thank you for showing us to do the stuff we put off doing with... sarcastic positivity
You had me at "this is a rough start"
3:55 PROtagonist - Good/Main guy Antagonist = Bad guy
So basically; you did ,in a episode, what you and etho couldn’t do, in a whole season, a year ago. Yours has to be the best. Props on the speed/ grind ability.
Yay for the horsecourse! :D it was cool, and still is cool c:
A lot of hermits have been putting in all-nighters for the charity stream. I'm looking forward to it
Haaaaappy laaaate birthday Bdubs!
Bdubs, you may want to look up "Protagonist."
Hey dubs,  did you know you can instantly remove power snow with water buckets. Spill water on it and it vanishes.
Happy late birthday
antagonist is bad guy - protagonist is good guy (main character energy)
Pretty sure that the antagonist is the Villan. Not the protagonist
Horse course! Horse course! Horse course! I was so sad you never got to use it, now I’m happy! Maybe you need to build a stable though
antagonist is bad guy
Well done champ and happy birthday 🎉
❤ great 👍
I'm sorry, B-bud. I want to tell you yours is better, but I gotta look at the facts. Etho made his on his own in one episode. You copied Ethos homework from the previous season to get the technical stuff done, and while looks are important, there isn't a proper game without the technical stuff. These aren't points in your favor, sadly.  Unless Etho managed to make a really bad game, I gotta give it to the guy.
Bdubs I think you meant to say "Antagonist" rather than "Protagonist". The protagonist is the main character, usually a good person where the antagonist is the one who presents the main problems for the protagonist. In this story Bdubs would be the protagonist (Etho may be a secondary protagonist also) who is heroically attempting to build the "Horse Corse" for the betterment of humankind.
when I saw this video thumbnail I had a moment of intense confusion lol. and I didn't realize, back in season 8, the true scale of the Horse Course. I'm surprised at how big it really is-- and I'm also very impressed that Bdubs got it done so fast ! even if he seemed a little delirious when he was singing and showing off the redstone at the end, haha ! get some rest, Bdubs <3 hope your sickness goes away soon !!
Happy belated birthday Bdubs
Can we talk about the stunning prismarine crastle Bdubs just casually threw up?! I don't remember it being prismarine last time and it's beautiful!!
So proud of you in doing this all in one go in time for the charity event! Hope you're feeling okay by then Much love to the one and only BdoubleO!!!
Get well soon Bdubs🙏🏻 lots of love from your fans and subscribers❤️ thanks for uploading videos for us to watch.. gotta love this man!😇
It would be cool to give participants healing potion arrows so that they can slightly knock back opponents without risking killing then or their horses
You have the best minigame in the minigame area
happy birthday
HAPPY BIRFDAY
Oh bless you Bdubs! I am so happy to see the horse course again and know that it will actually get used and Etho can say that you and he actually finished a project together....
Me in pain knowing one bucket of water would clear all the powder snow
I will give you my family's recipe for a sore throat cure. 2 cups boiling water. Juice of 3 lemons. Once cooled to body temp add a shot of whisky to every drink you have.
protagonist = good guy / antagonist = bad guy ;)  Happy Birthday btw. :)
i got some serious flashbacks when bdubs brought that horse through only for it so suffocate, some kind of swedish horse suffered that same fate i think
Watching Bduds complete the course and his sanity come out at the end is so worth it. Amazing job Bdubs I love you!
Gotta give that donkey a golden carrot for the perfectly timed “laugh”
Who did the coolest thing? Scar!... Who's the winner?  The kids who will benefit from the charity. Sorry Short Stuff, neither you nor Etho won in this situation... that said, you both did great, soooo much work in a single episode/week and all for a great cause!
Just saying etho built his in one episode, but bdubs built his and ethos horse race that took the whole season in one episode
Nice work!  Damn, BDubs, you should think about taking this Minecraft thing up full time...
Wishing you the most blessed belated 40th Birthday Bduds.
Snowballs or eggs would be a good idea for target blocks
Well bdubs you can use water to destroy snow powder. Also it's antagonist not protagonist
I love how everyone seems to think Xisumas ice farm is a minigame. He should just say it is a minigame and get people to farm ice for him.
HOIMYTCRAFT !! Bdubs you never fail to put a smile on my face
Happy late birthday B-dubs!
You could use honey instead of soul sand, granted it would slow them down more.
Of course horse course !!!
happy bday bdubs! 😁
Bdubs is the best!
<3
Hearing voices now bdubs really is I'll 😂
I like that etho didn't help so the server will stay alive hahaha
Happ birt mr antagonist
I’m really proud of you Bdubs :) Super sick and birthday week, still did the super grind for charity. You deserve the world and more :) Happy belated birthday!!! Hope you’re feeling better!
Happy B Day, uncle B! I'm 15 years older than you so enjoy your youth, snow block challenged!!!
To break snow fast, uncle B, dump water on it!!!
Happy birthday bdubs!
Well happy birthday then 😅
Far be it, from me, to be anti-protagonistic. But I do believe the word is auntietagnoist. Ok uncle B?
Bdubs is one good looking old man ...  I never knew
Boy I hope you used a schematic
1:15 “Jürgen no!!!”
The Netherrack trees are back! Also it looks like if you removed floating area at 20:00 the track would have a really nice view down into the valley
Bdubs you the man
antagonist lol
My hero, thank you for bringing back the horse course <3 Wanted to see more use from it and you and I share a love for horses. Hope you feel better soon =)
I’m so excited to see the horse course played by all the hermits. I was sad that season 8 ended so quickly and it wasn’t used
Your minigame is definitely the more perfect one (DON'T TELL ETHO!)
good job bdubs im so proud of you!!! this horse course is amazing
BDub's is one of the few YouTubers that has sponsor breaks that I can actually s it through and watch
I'm so happy too! I've always wanted to see a big race on the horse course!! Was a bit sad when season 8 ended and we didn't have time to see the course run on it's full glory but now it's even better!! Not only it is an awesome game but it's also going to be played for charity!! Good call Bdubs, I'm so glad you managed to build the full thing on time!
Happy BDay  BDubs! After all these years still looking fresh. I honestly thought you were in your early to mid 30s 🤯
I love your time lapses! Just wish they were a little longer!
Hey bdubs, will you be streaming on youtube or twitch, or something else on sunday?
Happy belated Birthday, Bdubs. Get well soon.  The horse course is looking amazing. Great job.
That's an incredible amount of work in one episode. Sorry Etho, you lose! I played this course a few times, very fun. I can't wait to see the Hermits play it during the livestream
Protagonist is the main character and antagonist is the person or force that opposes the protagonist.
You did an amazing job! Lots of hours and sweat went into this episode. Be sure to get some rest!
I’d say Etho did best because technically Etho designed all the redstone for the track.
Bdubz; the legend, making an interactive, fully-detailed, and well built race course in a single episode; one where he's not even in the best of health. Can someone be allowed to be that overpowered IRL??
Powdered snow can be removed with water…. Yes?
😂 yup!
happy birthday bdubs!
Seeing the horse course back gives me so much joy! I love the new additions too. This episode made me happy beyond words.
Wow, I always thought that the protagonists were the good guy. Thanks Bdubs for clearing that misconception up for me!
protagonist is good guy antagonist is bad guy
Yay! I was bummed we never got to see this used last season.
Protagonist:the leading character or one of the major characters in a drama, movie, novel, or other fictional text.  Antagonist:a person (or thing) who actively opposes or is hostile to someone or something; an adversary.
Brilliant! I only just made it through season 8, and was sad when nobody used the horse course. HuzzaH that we'll get to see some races!
Happy burwth day beedubs 🎉  We’re friend now
Happy birthday, hope u slept well 😅
I thought this vid is from hetmitcraft s8...he has the same build right??
Happy birthday !!! My last 3 kids in order are Halloween (daughter's )(boys) 22 & 19...🍪🍪🍪🍪🍪🙂
Bdoubs arguing about who’s is best when both games were designed by etho ;)
Happy belated birthday bdubs!!!
U can use water to insta remove powder snow !!!! ❤❤
BDUBS Protagonist is good guy, antagonist is bad guy
Looks amazing I'm glad it's back a d we will be able to see more hermits have a good .
Seeing the horse course finished is like seeing my dad finally come home with those cigarettes
I thought this episode was from season 8, while looking at the thumbnail at an instant..
Horse course is back baby! Very excited to see it actually get used!
Well, that's the end of this season!
Wooooo horse course!!!
Happy Belated Birthday, Bdubs! I'm not too far behind you on 40, but still feeling 25!(When my kids aren't around :/) You've aged better than I have, so at least you got that going for you! :)
Would the trees look better with stripped mangrove wood instead of netherrack?
You absolute madlad... the project that took all season last time, you knock out in one episode! WHILE SICK!
So stoked the horse course is back! Definitely one of my highlights of S8. Bdubs = Bestdubs
13:17 LOL they have SO MANY BEACONS but for some reason only 2 of the effects? Like why wouldn't you put all of them on. Scar especially wouldn't die nearly so much with resistance strength and regen...
I hope you are feeling better! Yes! The horse course is back!! I have never cheered someone on to get ‘er done more than this episode. And you did it…while sick! Was Etho sick? Hmmmm?…😅 I also love your commercial breaks. Well done, sir.
I literally thought YouTube was glitching, when I saw the thumbnail, and I saw “uploaded 9 hours” ago… I was like is he going back to Season 8???
I like how bdubs is bragging about his game over Ethos, even though Etho helped make bdubs game lol
You should put grandstands on the sides you built up
yeessssss  <3
Happy Belated Birthday bdubs :)
I’m so glad to see you bring this back! I thought it was such a wonderful build and was sad it was never used.
Happy late birthday sweet face.❤
Happy (late) birthday
How did that piglin drop like 10 swords wtf
Which is best? Hmmm….Battle Bane = 1 person + 10 years….Horse Coarse = 2 persons + (2 x 1/2 season) + hardship during implementation for charity due to illness of implementor….. Tough one. 😂
I'm sure it's been said, but protagonist is the good guy, antagonist is the obstacle.
So excited to see this played!
happy birthday bdouble0
But did you reallllyyyy do it in one episode if there’s slight terraforming left? 🧐
Happy Birthday to the best looking Oscar the Grouch look a like <3
btw you can remove powdered snow quickly with water
Soooo happy to see the horse course back Bdubs! Perfect idea.
i only need 4...ok ill take more.
I realize how many episodes it took to build that in season 8.  Amazing and awesome to see!  Was always hoping to see you guys use it.  🎉.
4:40 That gas station looks more like a car wash
Bdubs you should add a giant moon to the Coarse Horse.
Prowess?  Prowess.  Prowess!  PROWESS!   Should have kept a prowess counter. :D But yes, it's prowess.  You have prowess.
Happy birthday 🎂
Bdubs is so right him and Etho put so much time into Horse Course and no one got to end up playing it really which sucks because of the season being ended so short glad to see Bdubs bring it back this season and the fact it is the same course beside a little bit it is going to be great and funny can not wait
Very good be dubs I’m really impressed and really happy to see the horse course come back I so sad when you guys didn’t get to use it but excited to see you do it now fantastic perfect timing
Happy birthday! Today is my birthday!
Tenacious Bdubs
So it's not a Horsive Course?
The time lapse with that sweet jazz was perfect👌
What is that off centered third person camera because I've tried looking for something like that but couldn't find anything
Whats an antagonist then
So excited for the return of the Horse Course! I was really sad you never got to use it in S8! Looking forward to Sunday!
perfect redstone
ALSO! amazing job on the horse corse!!!!
This was my favorite hermitcraft project of all season 8. I was so invested in it, and now we might get to see the hermits actually using it! It's going to be so much fun.
Do you use skematica?
You did 8 months in 1 episode, ergo did 8 years in one episode, sorry to say but ergo won
17:56 That whole yellow terracotta column on the left is supposed to be honey blocks, no? If you don't have any, I'm sure Tango wouldn't mind donating it :) I think we can officially welcome you to Club Grinder along with Cub and Scar.  This episode was INSANE. And I'm so happy you brought it back for the charity. :)
I wonder if Camels can use the race course
I want to get the raycon ear buds but because I live in Australia it's going to cost $128. But luckily because of tge 15% off its just going to be $109. Still a lot tho
Happy late birthday Bdubs! ❤️
Amazing. So amazing
Such prowess! Very impressive
If you ever thought Bdubs was crazy, here us proof. Amazing for sure, but crazy
I'm sorry B double O dont wanna be a know it all but...  the Protagonist is actually the good guy. The antagonist on the other hand....
B-Dubs talking to the horses at the beginning gave me Dug from vibes
i hope you used xisuma's schematic helper to see what block needed to be placed
well happy belated birthday! lol
Bdubs Use a water bucket or flaming arrows on the powdered snow they not only destroy them instantly but mutiple at a time
happy birf day
Wrong! protagonist is hero antagonist is bad guy
Leave a random endrod somewhere in etho's game >D
Happy late birthday
Horse course my beloved...
Happy Birthday Bdubs!
Sorry to hear you're hoarse with the coarse Horse Course.  This time we should see some races. 🏇
Bdubz. I love you but you're crazy.
Happy birthday bdubz! You look great!
Happy happy birthday 🎉🎉
I can’t wait to try this in the world download!
Now you get the Lolathon treatment every day for the rest of your streaming career.  "Happy 40th Birthday!"  Enjoy being perpetually 40.  ;D
Lol.. Happy Belated Birthday Bdubs.. my birthday is the end of this month same age..
I love how both Etho and Bdubs resurrected dead projects. It’s gonna be an awesome Sunday!
keep up the grind bdubs, you're an inspiration for us all. see ya!
Happiest of birthday months to you, Ser Bdubs 🎂 I hope you're feeling better 🍲
happy birthday!!!! love what you are doing keep up the good work
Ethos is cooler 😘
ik its too late now but water instantly melts powdered snow
Yay horse corse is back I was sad that it barely got used last season.
I'm still waiting for Bdubs's episode called "Going crazy" in which he just shows us his most amazing "out there", crazy mad building ideas. Netherrack tree stems and so on. That'd be awesome to see
Bdubs, your mom thinks yours is cool. :P Amazing work. Even though it looks quite simple, the terraforming, hazards, and redstone work all sound like they took a lot of time, and to do it in short order like that is very impressive.
make your horse faster is speed potion
Happy Birthday BDubs!!!🎉
Jorgan flashbacks from pewdiepie
Good job, Bdubs. I hope you feel better soon.
Well done
B-Dubs is the Protagonist of his own life.
All y'all think Bdubs making horse track will end the season the way Bdubs' arenas always do, but I'm calling it now. The server will actually end when Beef makes his card game arena and the curse will be passed on to him.
Can’t wait to see the horse course in season 10! Great work man
Happy belated birthday, Bdubs!
Bdubs singing about the completion was amazing
TURNED OUT GREAT !!!!!!
Amazing.
Dude, super stoked for this. I was really hoping you guys were going to able to race last season, but unfortunately you ran out of time. This is going to be awesome!! Thanks for bringing it to season 9 for everyone to enjoy
Happy Birthday Bdubs!!!!! My mom is turning 40 soon too!!!!
Happy Birthday Bdubs. Love ya
I recently purchased Raycon everyday earbuds and love them. The awareness mode is perfect for nature walks. Showed them to a coworker who may now also purchase them.
Happy early 41st!
🦆
I love BDub’s horse course, and I especially loved his theme song 😂
LOL! 3:55 The protagonist is usually the hero. The antagonist is usually the villain.
BDOUBLEOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Considering he did all the redstone for yours originally i think he takes credit for some of yours too. Lol
Love it!  I was literally just thinking a couple of days ago that I didn't remember seeing anyone actually use the Horse Course last season.  Excited to see it back!  :)
Seeing the horse course coming to live again to finally be used makes me so happy
Never thought it would happen, and I couldn't be happier that it did, though, technically, the Etho-Bdubs co-project curse *is* still alive seeing as Bdubs made the horse course solo this time around
Well I guess this is the end of the season.
Happy bday hot guy
Happy birthday Bdubs! You have a song in your heart and a cough in your throat. I think you earned bragging rights over Etho!  Don’t push yourself hard much longer. Don’t want you sick on the charity stream.  Hope the husbandry goes smoothly, and also solve that portal suffocation issue!
Happy birthday :)
13:41 bdubs just killed your average London pedestrian😢
Happy belated birthday, Bdubs!
happy birthday
Let's be honest etho is taller so he wins
Happy Birthday🎉
Thank god etho and bdubs didn't collab on their charity games, the season would've spontaneously ended
It's been amazing seeing so many hermits remake and upgrade old games. Bringing them back to put to great use and for an amazing cause. It's going to be a great turn out. Can't wait to see the streams of the event!
i've had to check twice if this was really a season 9 episode or not...thumbnail threw me for a loop :D but yaay finally the horse course will be used and not just blown up by big moon!!
Happy birthday! The word you were looking for was antagonist, not protagonist. Protagonist is the good guy, which is you.
Hooray! Bdubs came back from the grave and he brought the horse course with him!
B-Dubs my man you deserve a nap after this build 😅
Happy bdouble100
HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY BDOUBLEO
The horse course looks great! I was sad to see it not really used last season. So its so wonderful to see it again!
HORSE COURSE HORSE COURSE HORSE COURSE
No Bdubs, a protagonist is the main character of a story, not necessarily a villian. I think “hurdle” or possibly “obstacle” woud be a better word.
I was so excited to see everyone play this last season - I'm glad they're finally gonna be able to play and enjoy your hard work!
You are insane for doing this to yourself but I love you for it
Good to see you back Merida…I mean bdubs. I was wondering is there redstone that allows for it to be triggered by a certain amounts of times pressed? So you could make a lap counter or special finish trigger
happy late birthday BdoubleO. I give you a 100% on a year of life \O^O/ love you videos
Happy belated birthday Bdubs! 40 years of step stool perfection.
thank you.
Please Mojang. Make pets in Minecraft Respawnables so that people can actually bring them in adventures without fearing losing their pet. Have it respawn at spawn or require an item or block to respawn it. It's time!
When I️ saw that he uploaded this I️ was like “is he that sick that he reuploaded a video by accident”
Bdubs protagonist is good guy haha, antagonist is bad guy
daja vu be like
For charity! 🎉 here here
If you want to get rid of snow fast then steal and use Scar Hotguy bow. As Total chaos showed, fire arrows destroy snow.
Nice prowess Bdubs
Wait, Tango’s wheel of sadness bartering was this season…
season 8 was such a good season that ended so soon. good to see a piece of it again
NO BDUBS ITS NOT SOON ENOUGH FOR THE SEASON TO END
It’s a beautiful build
Bdubs, ”protagonist” is the main character and the good guys. The word you’re looking for is “antagonist” which is the bad guys 😅
Hermitcraft, The Musical 🎵 🎶
habit birthday bdubs
Shoulda rode a cowboy, Bdubs. Coulda saved the horse
SUNDAY, SUNDAY, SUNDAY! WE'LL SELL YA THE WHOLE SEAT, BUT YOU'LL ONLY NEED THE EDGGGGE!
Right off the bat, Portal is killing the horse, so...WHY DO YOU HAVE A STUPID WALL ON ONE SIDE OF THE PORTAL??? doesn't make any sense to have a wall
I don't usually like stuff from past seasons to return *cough Grumbot cough* but I'm glad you did this for such a awesome cause since y'all never even played it last season.
Happy Birthday B-dubs 🎉🎂
Oh and happy birthday it’s my birthday today too
happy birthday bdubs😁
Love the addition of the tunnel.
Well guess the season is coming to an end then
very clever bdubs useing the wrong word to trick people into commenting ....   :)
Well guys, I guess season 9 is about to end
You mean Antagonist not protagonist
Happy birthday Bdubs !
Bdubs is literally a madman.. just listen to the crazed singing at the end. He has completely lost his marbles.
Happy birthday, to one of my favorite Hermit, but on a side note rendog is cool, but being king he's a brat,, much love to y'all BlueRuby 97
Happy Belated Birthday Bdubs!
Happy Birthday!
Hopefully mumbo will join in on the charity event.
Wait your 40???
I am so excited the Hoarse Course is back and we are going to see it in action! Woo!
Protagonist is the hero more or less. You meant antagonist. :p
11:45 that doggy shake O_O
Such prowess!
First Battle Bane, now Bdubs is making a horse course?! At this rate, season 9 will end in a week!
Protagonists are the good guys
So happy to see the horse course back. It's more beautiful than I remember it.
Hey, it's my 40th birthday too! Happy Birthday Bdubs.
I hope you feel less sick soon Bdubs! As someone who never saw the horse course from season 8, this looks AMAZING! I want to build something like it in my own world now!
Happy birthday lovely bdubs xxx
Happy birthday Bubs if I was on hermit craft I make. Coustome BDubs  Minecraft plushy
What a flipping legend you are Bdubs.
I really thought The horse course with Etho was still this season and I thought you're going to use that one... Totally forgot it was previous season
The Horse Course returns to end season nine!
Happy Birthday!!!!
Hate to hear you're under the weather bdubs, heard ligma is going around again 😢. Hope you don't have it
Mad mad respect for this absolutely insane feat Bdubs. The terrain is never to be underestimated in a build this elaborate, but you know this better than anyone, and it has never stopped you before. Nevertheless, it's unreasonable to expect consistent greatness from even the greatest, and yet you deliver. Respect.
This reminds me of the time Bdubs casually made a mountain between episodes  Excited to see this return and err… get used!
2:17  One day? More like *1 decade* lmao
Can you melt powdered snow with lava?
Only a bad guy would say a protagonist is a bad guy... You're lookin kinda sus there bdubs! Also Happy Birthday!
love your horse course song
I hope your feeling all better soon Bdubs! You did amazing rebuilding the horse course from Season 8!!! Your red stone building skills just keep getting better. Etho will be so impressed!! I sure am! Thank you Bdubs. <3 ~respect
Madman!
...I'm calling it now, this is where the horse track curse is finally broken. 2022 is the year of the unexpected, and third time's the charm!
I think you meant antagonist, but I digress.        Dammit, you tricked me with the classic "say something incorrect to solicit lots of angry comments and improve your video's performance*. Touché, good sir... touché.
If you want to clear powdered snow quickly, you can use a water bucket! Hope that helps in the future
Me in the first five minutes:  *antagonist *Antagonist *AnTagOniSt *ANtaGOniST! *ANTAGONIIISSSTTT!!
"Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of our protagonists Time, Blocks, and Sickness, Villain Bdubs was able to absolutely decimate the landscape and successfully rebuild his evil glue processing factory."
Protagonist? That's... the good guy...
Had a suspicion Etho’s game was putting pressure on you.. was so happy to hear i was right. Good stuff. Loved the determination mixed with overwhelmed exasperation
Happy (belated) birthday Bdubs, I hope you had a great special day!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MR BDUBS! I HOPE YOU HAD A LOVELY DAY
Bdubs has the coolest commercials, but Etho may have slightly more perfect redstone.
Protagonists is good guy antagonist is bad guy but I knew what you were saying
What happend to the big Door in the Mountain?
Flaming arrows remove powdered snow
Welp, Bdubs built a race track, season's ending.
I LOVE your singing tour!
Bdubs!! You don't have to dig through snow, you can just spill water and water will take care of it all!!
I did indeed enjoy! Love your videos and personality b!
What a wonderful singing voice! Bdubs you should make an album... also, happy birthday!
I'm having a déjà Fu
Bdubs completing the horse course makes me think of Prometheus finally having the eagle stop eating his liver after Heracles killed it
As long as bdubs and etho don't collab on a PVP game we're safe. Hell-of-a grind my man.
when etho built battle bane, i got worried the season was going to end soon with you building this, i think it must be
Wanted to make sure you considered using litematica when doing this?  It can really speed up remaking something or copying parts of builds.
Happy birthday
happy birthday
you could convert stone with moss, mossy boy!
Very inspiring, the amount of grind you did, BDubs!!
Misusing a word over and over again for engagement.  BDubs is working the algorithm!
Wow man! Congrats on that completion! Very very impressed that you did a 6 month job in a few days
happy late birthday bdubs
I'm so happy S8's horse course made a comeback! Finally it will see the races it deserves!
why does he wear chainmail armor
It kind of looks like your missing some blocks to fill in the space under the track ;)
The funny thing is he's doing all this for charity. But the majority of charities are extremely corrupt and take a lot of the money.
Yea…protagonist is good guy, antagonist is bad guy
You touched grass man
Wait what.... 11:45 - I've never had a pizza with more than one slice.... what is this witchcraft....!?!?!?
I was wondering if you'd stick with the netherrack or if you'd switch over to stripped mangrove since you had a red wood now. Cool to find out.
Bdubs has spoken! Protagonist is bad guy. Revise every dictionary!
Protagonist is actually whoever is first point or telling the story. If the villain is telling the tale, they are still the protagonist, and the antagonist is the hero who is opposing them in the story
Happy Birthday BDubs!!!! :D
It'd be nice if you or xiumia could blend his ice farm into the environment a bit more. Some pillars to make it look a bit like a bridge would be perfect
Absolutely craziness
When I was a child, my uncles used to throw me into the trunk of the car and drive around. But I had all the beer. It worked out.  Never ride anything but a donkey.
Bdubs should join mcc He’d work well with pearl, scar and Grian
“you know the average pizza has 8 slices, well the headphones have 8 hours of play time.” this made me laugh
I love watching Bdubs get happy about successful redstone:)
bdubs, you should have known this portal was not horse or donkey safe from Etho's first few episodes.
Happy Birthday Bdubs!
Bdubs! you can get rid of powdered snow quicker with water :)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
ANTAGONIST
the hardest thing about the charity event is figuring out which hermit i want to watch. can't wait tho!
Bdoubleo you never fail to impress. I can't wait to see this being played.  LOVE YOU
guys I think its antagonist....
My recommendation is to get skeleton horses for even stats among players and use snowballs for the targets.
Bdubs=future literature professor? 😬🤐
Oh, so we just going to brush over the piglin dropping 8 swords? ok... nothing highly unusual about that....
Bdubs... a protagonist is the good guy The villian is called the "antagonist"
good to see you feeling better
its always a horse course
Get feeling better BDubs!!
Hoymit ce-affftt
I missed you 😭
This build is amazing bdubs I love it your amazing
Happy really "BELATED" birthday not friend😉
Not sure why you'd worry about copying Etho's redstone when you taught him everything he knows!
Yoooou diiiid iiiit youuuuuuuuuuuuur waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
What Etho and Tango were really thinking- "Why wouldn't you just use TNT?" :D
This was very cool!! But please rest!!
You are an absolute wild man doing this! Looks amazing!! make sure you rest before the event!
Can't wait for BDubs to make his Camel-Course, maybe have a team-racing event where everyone is shooting each other off their camels, dashing over crevices or through shortcuts.
Samaritan called. He's all confused about the whole protagonist/antagonist dealio. Love seeing Horse Course back. So many rushed projects for S8 that never got their time in the sun.
Im slightly concerned for your sanity after watching this XD but it looks amazing!!
PROTAGONIST IS GOOD GUY 😂😂 antagonist is bad guy, boo
I was so sad when season 8 ended without seeing the horse course in action. I’m so happy seeing this!
No horsestop? Everyone must use at least 2 different horses like an f1 race. Just to make it more sportworthy to win
bdubs was on the grindset holy
rip to your poor horse </3
If you ever need to remove a lot of powdered snow, use water. It destroys it as fast as it can flow.
Camel course?
Man I missed all of season 9, BDubs is makin' a game so surely the end is nigh
Etho is better lol
Did a double take at the thumbnail
Ssssooooo can we talk about the fact that King Ren's right hand man is eating cooked beef instead of giga pies?
Jorgen
Thank god bdubs is okay from sick
later in the season you can do horse vs camel race
bdouble0, just so you know, protagonist is usually the good guy, and antagonist is usually the bad guy.
man bdubs will just always be the best at building backdrops … which also have a function most of the time
"So it turns out BDUBS is a bit of a genius..."
Protagonist = good guy Antagonist = bad guy  PRO = good ANT = bad
Happy belated birthday, Bdubs! 🎉 Hope you feel better soon.
Bdubs, i really missed you! Loved the episode and I hope you’ll get better soon!
Happy birthday! You're only 40? How young. Here's to many more.
Bdubs singing like a madman as he showed the finished course really sold me on the idea that he is an absolute maniac and has lost his mind. In all the right ways
In a build/episode battle between  hermits. Hmmm we'd never vote for the hand of the king.  ;)
Wow. gotta respect the grind :D
Bdubs, you missed the amazing music and fireworks on mend n go
Powdered snow does that???
Etho built a battle arena and BDubs is building the horse race again... Well the season will be over in a couple episodes. It's been fun.
Etho's a better man and he's taller than you.
USE WATER!! To remove the powdered snow. It destroys it instantly =) Even if you don't use it this time, I hope the advice is useful for the future ^_^
Round of applause for Bdubs and his prowess and dedication!
Bdubs is the king of decoration...not only did he make something pretty, but he had the designer chops (and the audacity) to decorate it with manure!  This guy is the master of little details, I tell ya!
I'm so happy that the horse course and the car wash from season 8 are coming back, season 8 was criminally too short and nothing got finished, it was awful to have it that short and im glad this season will be long to make up for all that lost potential.
it's like a gamejam inside a game!
Protagonist number 1: Bdub’s Vocabulary
If you want to remove alot of powdered snow, just pour water on it
Subconsciously screaming "No, Joergen!" when that horse died. It's a sad start 😭
i bet on losing horses by mitski
Happy Birthday, Bdubs :)
Amazing! Can't wait for the stream day, it's going to be a lot of fun to see everyone playing these awesome games together
Happy birthday and hope you get better
Happy birthday Bdoubs!
Well now that Bdubs is working on the horse course again I can only assume this season is going to suddenly end very soon
Welp I guess etho's hermitcraft season is ending soon
Nice! It was always a bit disappointing that no one was able to run the horse course back in season 8.
Hey   Bdubs          Happy birthday 🎉
Happy birthday bdubs
My first thought was call Joe hills for help.   Hope you get feeling all the way better.   And holy cow what a serious crazy awesome build.
Antagonist is the badguy protagonist is the hero.
Hmm... Thing is, though, BDubds.  Etho made his BattleBane arena all on his own.  You did all the building on your own, to be sure, but you copied the redstone from Etho!  So, he still has a leg up on you, I would say...
This episode was magnificent. Everything was on point: the music, the horse course, the commercial even.
I think you can clear powdered snow with water
I did a double-take when I saw the title
Antagonist is the bad guy, the one who antagonizes. Protagonist is the good guy, the pro.  I'm so glad to see the horse race is back! Season 8 was probably my favorite season before Moon Big. There were so many great things. It was such a shame that it ended so soon. But as you show here, that doesn't mean these things are gone forever. I can't wait to see you guys actually race this course!
Legendary!! It’s better than before!
I'm kind of in love with Bdubs' irl face -- such a handsome, swarthy man.. lol
...I'm kinda sad. I'm not Bdubs' friend? I mean, Bdubs the character, of course I don't know the man behind the camera.
happy late birthday Bdubs sorry I'm not your friend
Bdubs saying protagonists instead of antagonists was triggering me fr
I was honestly just thinking yesterday about how I wish the horse course had gotten used. I played it on the world download. I'm so excited to see it back for Season 9!!!
Now that BDubs has finally made a horse course, the next goal should be a camel course for 1.20
I don't mind you not seeing me as a friend.  But I still wish you a wonderful year full of health (maybe after the rough start here) and generally a good time with family and friends.
Tomorrow morning I thought to myself what I would do if I traveled one year back in time. Then I saw this Thubnail and thought to myself: „Oh hey a new BDubs Vid- WHAT THE HECK?!“ Nice Episode
You should make a leaderboard to see which hermit got the best time or track who won the most races
Ayo the ray cons
Grateful applause ... worried applause ... leans to the next guy "Is Bdubs okay?  I hope that he's okay..."
So you're telling me... you could have finished the whole Horse Course last map....
I wanted to wish you a happy birthday but didnt know how! Glad to see your health and fingertip is healing up!
<3
Welcome to 40 pal
Love it. Looking forward to the event!
Here we go again
Not another horse course
I bet bdubs brought an 🍎 for the king too.
You should definitely add watching platforms up high where you could see the whole course so others can watch the finale race.
Absolute mad man bdubs!! So happy to see the horse course in this season and so far no sign of moon big 🤣
flowing water over powdered snow instantly removes them :)
The drive you had to complete this in one episode... while feeling under the weather... It's honestly really inspiring! This was amazing Bdubs
Happy belated birthday, Bdubs!
I hope you feel better Bdubs
can we get a new segment called "Prowess with Bdubs"?
something i've noticed every minigame is missing, audience stands! horse course could probably have a viewing place on top of the building in  the middle so people can watch and cheer...just a thought
Insane! Great work Bdubs! In the spirit of friendly competition, yeah I’d say you did way more in an episode than Etho, but I do love you both though!
I love how bdubs gets protagonist and antagonist mixed up
Happy Birthday Bdubs
hay hope you didnt make yourself too sick doing this! very impressive
BAPPY HIRTHDAY!!!!
got so confused by the thumbnail had to do a double take to make sure it was the right season
Congrats on hitting the big 4-O Bdog!
Incredible feat to build this all in one episode!! Congratulations BDubs
Epic episode Bdubs!!! The whole course in a single episode 😱
Happy Birthday bdubs!!!
amazing bdubs . feel better soon ! oh and a very happy late birthday x
antagonist
Season 8 looks slightly different than I remember
English is also his protagonist
Hey, I'm part of the '82 crew too! Happy b-day, bdubz!
Happy late birthday b dubs
never having the chance to see the horse course in action was the thing I regretted most when season 8 ended. I'm unreasonably happy to see it again.
Ethos is better because he's taller
Should have prepared tnt for the snow. Or digging
Oh my goodness Bdubs, this was the grind!!!
🎉happy birthday 🎉
When I saw the video in my notifs I was so confused, watching it was kinda sweet tho I love how both you and Etho have each brought back a game of yours of the past I look forward to seeing the hermits actually playing this game!
Water breaks powdered snow
1:10 jorgen vibes
Happy belated, birthday! 🥺💖 I wish I had knew sooner! I'll try and be a better friend in the future, Bdubs. 😔💖
I really, really hope you had schematica or some equivalent because this seems like hell already, let alone trying to copy someone thing one to one.
Oh so cool can't wait to see what kind of horse the other hermits breed and what armor they put on them
I remember the hollow hills horse course as if it was yesterday. It's great to see it come back on to the server and maybe even be used for the very first time (apart from testing of course)
happy birthday
Maybe someone left a comment already but just in case, the fastest way to get rid of a bunch of powdered snow is a few buckets of water.
happy birthday
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!! You win!
Everyone in the comments correcting BDubs not realizing that *he's* the antagonist.
I love that the horse course came back! I was bummed we didn’t get to see it really ran last season
Wait didn’t etho visit the horse course weeks ago? So confused on the timeline lol
You are a true legend!! ❤️ ❤️
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!
HOIIIIMEEECRAYYYYYYFFFFT
Happy Birthday Bdubs!
Bdubs coughed then right after a Robitussin ad played lol. Not sure if its on purpose
I'm so happy to see the horse track come back. I was so excited for it in S8 but the apocalypse happened before ir could be put to use. Really happy you're bringing back horses. Me and my friends actually gets excited in finding horses again. XD
BDubs, a _protagonist_ is the _hero._ An _antagonist_ is the bad guy.
Do you want to doom the server ?!? jk you did amazing Bdubs :D
THE HORSE COURSE LIVES
Seeing the horse course again makes me so happy! I always wanted to see it used
I'm pretty sure the protagonist thing was a joke, he fell into the snow and called it a protagonist, despite it hurting and potentially killing him, after getting out saying that the protagonist was a bad guy, because he had stated that the snow that couldve killed him was a protagonist.
Etho: In a single episode rebuilds a minigame he made in the past and never got to use, but it takes far longer than anticipated. Bdubs: "Etho built his minigame all in one episode and inspired me" Proceeds to also remake a previous minigame in a single episode, also taking much longer than anticipated. Whoda thunk.
Happy Birthday Bdubs! I turned 40 this year too!
happy late birthday bdoubs
Well done sir you did an amazing job doing all that joi stop of being poorly your an amazing Minecrafter hope your feeling better soon and happy 40th birthday
I'm so glad to see the horse course is going to be used. I was really looking forward to it in series 8 and it never happened. Can't wait to see it in action. Happy Belated Birthday Bdubs.
Way to go Bdubs for charity. You did it. Kids love horses so yours will probably be a favorite. And it was made by you, of course.
does anybody know the song at 8:30?
Instead of breeding horses, you could let everybody bring their own horses to save you some work. And it would be funny to see what the other hermits bring to the event
Water destroys powered snow dump a bucket over it.
U can remove powdered snow using lava buckets
Déjà vu
season 8 places coming back is all fun and games till the moon starts to grow
I have never clicked a video so fast
Bdubs, protanonist is not bad guy...
Hey! I had a birthday in March! 😃 What a coincidence!
ah yes whos is better, the game etho and bdubs made or the game etho made.
Etho made a pvp game and bdubs made a horse course THE SERVER IS GOING TO CLOSE SOON AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH BOTH OMENS BOTH OF THEM AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
happy birthday bdubs love u man
You the man, Bdubs!  Looking forward to a camel course in 1.20!  Don't forget the betting on horse races... how about a place to put down your bets, and a board to show the odds?
You Win. 😁
Wow wow wow!!! That is very impressive to bring this course back in one episode!
Pretty glad we finally get to see the horse course. I remember it being started in season 8 and always wondering when it would get finished
ETHO coolest
The whole song about redstone was great! Your horse course is looking delightful! You put so much work in it. Hermits are gonna have so much fun!   Scar is organizing amazing event for a great purpose❤   Can’t wait for it!
As much of a pain as it is, digging out the ground for the horse course was the right move. Sometimes that's the right way to go but I like to avoid building above as much as possible.
The legend is back, yay! Hope you get better and better for every day that passes
At first I thought you were crazy to do all this work by yourself without asking Etho to help out (or maybe you did and he was busy with irl as per his most recent tweet).   But the fact you actually finished it without Etho is extremely impressive. And it’s a good thing too because otherwise you would have brought the Etho/Bdubs build an arena curse to season 9 and Imm hoping for at least another 6 months in this world at least!  Happy belated birthday! Sorry for being a terrible person. But your raycon ad was excellent lol
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!
Protagonist LOL
Uh oh.  Bdubs finished a minigame.  Guess it's time for season 10.
I think water breaks powdered snow, could use a water bucket maybe?
Happy belated birthday Bdubs!  And maybe he meant that he was the antagonist of the multiple protagonists he named. Bdubs is the true villain.
bdubs, water bucket clears powdered snow like nobody's business ... just letting you know
Bdubs is everyone’s antagonist.
I may not be your friend Bdubs but Happy belated Birthday
uuhhh happy birthday?
I was truly confused what I saw the thumbnail, I was like "but that's not a season 9 thing.. " but after watching the video I am extremely impressed I would never have the ambition to rebuild something like that
man, I was kinda bummed we never saw the course used in S8, is cool to see its back
I was so sad to see in season 8 this beautiful thing didn’t serve any use now it does!
Happy Belated Birthday Bdubs!!
Plottwist, the Horse Corse is what calls the moon.
That was an insane amount of work. Well done sir!
Happy Birthday BDubs! Much Love Buddy! Thanks for the great Entertainment!!!
I bought the Raycon ear buds after I lost my other set and I absolutely love them! Thank you Bdubs for the 15% off!!
Is this a bad time to tell you that you could have placed water on the powdered snow to melt it?
Best ad i've seen so far;)
Sorry but my great grandpas 84th birthday is today so I’m more focused on that lol
I am looking forward to it doubling as a camel course, having a second rider to hit the targets
I'm soo glad the horse course is making a comeback. Veeery excited to see the hermits compete here!
I really appreciate you doing this solo, you didn't have to do it in one episode. But for the love of god, whatever you do, do not ask Etho to work on a project with you. We need this season to last.
Joe took his patrons to play the horse course and it was really cool, can't wait to see the Hermits take it on!
Horse courses is one of my favorite things to do in Minecraft and now we will have Camels to race to.  P.S. Happy Belated BDay.  If I was rich I would buy You pony and send it in the mail.
from one not a friend to another not a friend, Happy Birthday Bdubs, you're not my friend
6th protagonist: You need a stool   P.S. I’m kidding 😘. And I did remember it was your birthday, even through a small birthday party, how fitting, in your honor 👍🏼
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MR. 😊DOUBLE0100
How is King Ren the Protagonist, he's clearly the good guy.
Hope you get well soon BDubs  !
@Ethoslab is still the best.
Etho is still taller
Bdubs is the antagonist on the server confirmed. He will betray the king and bring balance to the server
Jesus the whole server went nuts for this event. I've never seen so many builds spring up over night like that
I remember thinking my dad was so old when he turned 40. Now I’m just as close to it as he is
With the 1.20 camels this would be even better!!
Happy belated birthday bubbles
Comment dfor algorigm
love that you brought back the horse course bdubs!
Happy budday Budubs
Haven’t I seen this before?
Happy belated birthday sir.  Love the idea of recreating the horse track.  Was sad it was never used last season.  Just don't burn yourself out.  Making changes to fit the terrain is all part of Minecraft.
So glad that you're feeling better from your ailment. The soup pox
Protagonist is the main character, antagonist is the things that work AGAINST you
“Protagonist is 'bad guy,' for those of you who don’t know.”  Uhhhh... I guess I didn't know XD
Bubbles is a madman O_O
Happy birthday
Wow Bdubs fighting all the protagonists at once, turns out he's a supervillain
3:55 Protagonist is the *good* guy, the *antagonist* is bad, because you know, “anti-“ prefix
Happy late birthday Bdubs! Sorry I can’t be your friend. 😢
A spectacular effort! Feel better soon!
Can't wait to hear what bubbles thinks about camels
Not gonna lie, I'm as happy to see this reborn as I was sad to see it unused in S8.
HELLL YESS. I have been waiting for thiss!!!!
I noticed many of the hermits using your glowing signs trick
HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY :D
Having all the Deja-vu from last season now
You could use an water bucket to remove powderd snow
Don’t let Etho help you finish the horse course or it will never be finished!
BDubs really out here doing it for the kids! We love it BDubs. Thanks for all your dedication and hard work to get this all done for charity❤
Use water to quickly eliminate powdered snow.
Fun to have a great season 8 reference, this charity event is going to be brilliant!
Was that a 'Pizza-John' reference in the commercial break there...?
When I saw the thumbnail, for a split second I thought it was S8
happy late birthday!
I belive you mean antagonist lol =)
Season 10 incoming
I won’t fall for your test BDubs I know that you know protagonist is good guy
congrats on 40 years
That was great singing
Very impressed at how much work you got done in such a short amount of time Bdubs!  I'm happy to see this game back on HC Also happy birthday!
Belated happy birthday 🎂🎈. Hope you're feeling better soon. Wonderful video as usual, can't wait to see everyone racing on Sunday. Take care
was very confused why I was getting a notification for an old episode, all makes sense now
Amazing as always Bdubs! Thank you!
Camel races
Happy birthday bdouble0100!!! 🎉
I enjoyed the commercial, all of them in fact.
Etho still had some redstone to do, you still have potions and horses to get. Hermitcraft should have everyone who plays vote on the best game at the end.
Happy bday 🎉
22:22 Sun big?
Happy Birthday 🎂 🥳 🎉
you've no idea how many times i've searched youtube for a new bdouble video :)
Horse courses? Of courses of courses!
Me: whew, what a stressful time crunch i've just had for school. Time to watch some hermitcraft to relax!  Bdubs: im gonna make the whole horse course in one episode  Me: ah. This has not helped 👍   I'm kidding of course. Lovely video!
HAPPY B-DAY BDUBS!!!!!🥳
Loved this episode, Excellent addition and contribution to the games, Thank you Bdubs.
A protagonist is the character who the story follows primarily. A villain can be the protagonist, in the even the story follows them.   An antagonist is a character who provides challenge to the protagonist. A hero can be the antagonist in a story with a morally gray protagonist.   Unlike hero and villain, which refer to the morality of the characters, protagonist and antagonist are a matter of perspective and how you see the story unfolding.
Hello BdoubleO
You’re only asleep for like 2 years and then you wake up to find out that what once was Hermitcraft is now called Hoymeecray. What happened in between? 😂
Bdubs protagonists are good guys😂antagonists are bad guys, just saying. Hope you feel better sickie poo
Welp, happy late birthday
Happy b day
As well as having a fast-horse-race you could consider a donkey race too! or a pigs race! Also i hope you feel better soon x
Hold on! Sus detected. You say this is a competition with Etho and you didn't fill in the terrain underneath? Excuse me? ;-)
Did Paul scahffer write that time lapse music? I felt Letterman was about to make a cameo
HAPPY BELATED BDAY BDUBS. what a handsome man
I'm so glad its back. It sucked that it wasn't used in season 8
With a video like this you can really feel the grind come through, how much you had to skip through, and the sheer willpower it took to pull it together. Not only did you have the project to complete, it was part of the project of making a video out of it which you also probably had to pound out! Bdubs, class act. And I like many others I imagine will feel fulfillment seeing the long awaited horse course get some use!
BDubs, you don’t have to copy Etho to be cool, though mimicry is about admiration
HAPPY (LATE) BIRTHDAY!!!!!!
hope you feel better man this was insanely ambitious and you delivered!!! happy you brought the gorgeous build back but oh boy the end might be upon us jk
Well he did teach Etho everything he knows about redstone after all....😏
Happy late birthday Bdubs! We love you!!
This episode has so many protagonists, and yet it's recorded from the perspective of the deuteragonist. What a groundbreaking new cinematography technique! Bdubs, you never cease to amaze.
The curse of the smp servers is that they always end before anyone can use the pvp arena.  this time looks like we might actually get to see Battle Bane and the horse course!  if only Iskall and Ren were crazy enough to try and revive the Moba Lisa
HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY
Glad to see it back, hope it’s as fun as it looks.  Mammoth effort on your sick bed.
I think it's a good addition if you put slowness potions and speed potions in the arrow potion thingy so the game is also a bit luck based and maybe more fun
I was so confused from that thumbnail and title paired with the "one hour ago".. I could've sworn it was last season!
congratulations!
Wonderful to see the horse course finally back!!
Also, mumbo just came back from his massive trip, do he's about to come back to a server full of minigames. He'll probably be bad at them all, but it'll be fun to watch him play lol
So is this the secret to break the curse of the season ending arena builds, "simply" build two of em? 🤔
Happy birthday!!!
Bdubs you can use water buckets on powdered snow and it'll get rid of a lot:)
!
"protagonist is bad guy"  Error, or clever setup for the war to overthrow the king?
The writer in me died a little every time he referred to ‘protagonist’ as the bad guy 😂
Happy Birthday Bro! TY for the content all these years
Holy moly, the lengths you go through for charity
I mean you both made a game in one episode...but technically Etho helped with your redstone (just last season). So you did not complete a game by yourself in one episode. Just kidding, awesome that you recreated it in the new server, glad to see it will get used.
Audience seats would be really cool to fill the empty spacess
If u can build mountains in one episode u bet u can build this in one episode as well! And Happy Birthday  Bdubs!
You can use water tho get rid of the snow
Happy Birthday Bdubs!
Can't wait to finally see the course being used!
Another episode of hormicrafft with bdoeoeblee 000
bdubs.. it's antagonist silly mossman. haha love bringing back the horse course
Clever loophole Bdubs! By not building the Horse Course with Etho, you have avoided the Bdubs-and-Etho-build-an-arena-and-the-season-ends-before-anyone-plays curse!
Yes.. I thought I'd never see this race.. thank you bdubs
Happy birthday to you! 🎉
Happy birthday
Is just me or bbodl look like hitler
Someone needs to make an animated cartoon version of bdubs testing his horse track
er... I think protagonist is the good guy... right?
Happy b day
Bdubs, if you wanna get rid of the powdered snow quickly use a flame bow cause that managed to get rid of the powdered snow at total chaos
for future projects, you can remove large patches of powdered more easily snow by shooting flame arrows through it
We’re doing reboots now, sweet
Bdubs made a horse course again… the end of the season is nigh
Wonder if it would have been easier if bdub used that client side mod that tells you where to place blocks
This is the third season in a row where beloved Bdubs moves mountains for our entertainment!
“Protagonist is bad guy, for those of you who don’t know.”  That’s bait. ☝️
Happy birthday 🎉
Protagonist is bad guy? 🤔
Happy 40th Bdubs! I just recently turned 21, wild to think I started watching you almost 9 years ago. I was 12 then. Time flies...
You made my day!
this was literally SO AWESOME
First Etho makes an arena, and now Bdubs makes a horse course? Pray for the server everyone 🙏
Happy late birthday to the Master Builder himself!!
I'm 3 minutes in and hoping beyond hope for a horse race involving only the descendents of Speedy Supreme
just a quick tip, you can wash away powdered snow with water bucket if you didnt know
Bdubs at 7:31 is just like us in 60 years wandering through the neighborhoods we've grown up in, don't getting that times have changed
Amazing...👏
I am so Happy you did this.
3:55 isn't that's an antagonist?! 😅
I'm so proud of you bdubs! So excited to see it in action!
Etho still wins since his has original redstone
I’m glad to see the course make a comeback!
Corporate wants you to find the difference between these words. Protagonist. Antagonist. Scar: "They're the same word".
Bdubs has been on this earth for over 50 years no way he messed up the definition of protagonist and antagonist.
I’m almost as excited to see the bourse course get used as I was to see a new Bdubs episode!
i'll never understand wireless earbuds  why would you want to change earbuds that last forever, for ones that last only 8 hours?   just to not have some wires?  and on top of that they're also way more expensive  makes no sense to me
Nice race Field...wild west horse race track.  I see your imagination.. Keep going ! Dont quite. Bitting/horse race with-( #) is a big game!
Happy Birthday Bubbles!!!
Etho bragging he got his done in a single episode.  Well do did Bdubs... just needs to landscape, plant grass and flowers, get potions, bred horses, etc., etc.... ")
Happy belated birthday bdubs!
Happy Birthday Bdubs!  - ‘Not My Friend’
Gel-tips? I always call them "dammits" because that's the first thing I say when I lose one.
Ethos redstone with bdubs
You're the best B-Dubs, the antagonist, if you will.. I always hoped to see the horse course in action and now I can. Also, you built a freaking mountain in one episode last season so I wasn't too worried about this.
Happy Birthday Sir!!
Happy possibly belated birthday bdubs.
at this point i only watch for the add reads !!
BDubs perfect redstone was perfect! Great job, hope you’re feeling better Bubbles
What’s up with the coyote brown tshirt? You working for the military now Bdubs?
you should alsi have a podium inside one of the buildings.
Happy birthday Bdubs!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BDUBS
"Protagonist is bad guy"  Antagonist: "Do I mean nothing to you?"
Happy Belated Birthday BDubs!!! You always make my day and I get sad whenever I don't see your new video notifications.
Happy birthday!
off camry stream soon please    🥺 👉👈
happy birthday, Bdubz!!
Bdubs, you can use bucket of water to quickly remove powdered snow! Also happy belated birthday!
You're a mad man bdubs. But we love you.
Man, the horse course was what made me sad (along with the big eye territory) that season 8 was ending so soon after it started. I'm chuffed to bits seeing such a magnificent mini game come back and done (more or less) in one episode!
Bdubs is a sucker for not using TNT on the powdered snow
I was very sad to see this not being used in s8 so im glad youve brought it over.
Happy late birthday
I am definitely not your friend. I am just a fan and a jealous one at that. Merry Unbirthday. Stay sharp brother
Why not use donkeys at the horse course? They're all the same speed and jump unless you breed new ones, so it would be fair game, maybe you could even win better ones or just win a random horse? Saves you a ton of testing the stick and snow powers of horses, and you would have to keep racing to win a good horse unless you get super lucky! Opens up a use for a stable as well, where you can keep your racing horse in your own spot at the stable or something?  Rambling aside, I absolutely love seeing the comeback of the horse course and you definitely won whatever contest etho got you into! Great video as always, thank you for the entertainment <3
I’m glad you built this again. Was really sad when we didn’t see any horse course game play  in season 8. Great video bdubs
Happy late birthday Bdubs. Love from a fellow old. Lol
there's some audio problem i think?
Protagonist is good guy bdubs, lol.
This already is the best hermitcraft season ever
happy late birthday bdubs 🎉
Protagonist is main character. Antagonist is bad guy.
happy birthday
Upgrade!
Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Bdubs!! Happy birthday to you!! Hope you had a great day with the fam!!
Im confuse if this episode is from season 8 or not. Lol
Bdubs, next time you need to clear a lot of powdered snow, you can use water buckets or even just set yourself on fire repeatedly.
So glad Horse Course is back
Pretty sure Tango would say "shorty" in your head
I was so confused when I saw the horse course with a Series 9 title... So glad to see it make a comeback!
Bdubs youre the best
Happy Late Birthday Bdubs! Hope you had an amazing day! 🎉
Bdubs the type of MF to not ask for help to finish a mammoth project in a very short time.
Happy Belated Birthday B-Dubs!
Amazing B-Dubs!
tnt is so underrated
Happy birthday! 🎉🎈🎊
Happy belated birthday bdubz! (HBBB) 🎉 luv your builds,mindset, and creativity towards minecraft. How ever old you are you only look 30! (Srry if ur younger 😂)
Oh, sweet bubbles...
Good thing you didn't need ethos help, or the season would have to end before the obstacle course is finished
bdubs we have missed you
You look like an Enthousiastic Library Granny with those glasses. Sorry, cannot unsee
Uuuuuuh.... HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BDUBS!!!
Yeah another episode of "Placing blocks in a pattern, with that DoubleB O guy" aka Building with BDubs!!!
BDubs, I'm sorry but Etho brought Battle Bane back from the dead
Happy late birthday
I thought I was having a fever dream for a moment 😭
HORSE -DIVORCE- COURSE
I think for the targets that shoot the potions it should be a slowness potion because its seems like it will be to difficult to time it to hit the swiftness on yourself but the slowness will be a great way to sabotage the people who are ahead of you in the race!
Happy late birthday
obsessed with the horse course redstone song when's the full album coming out
You're a madlad! Can't believe you rebuilt it completely! I can't wait to see it get played, now!
Absolutely stunning, love to see the course back. Finally ist's gonna be used.
Happy birthday past Bdubs ❤
Bdubs: "it's up to you to decide who did the coolest thing" also Bdubs, in 1st person, looking at Etho's course: "you're looking at him!"
omg bedubs happppy birthdaayayayayayayayyaya!!!!!!!!!! siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Belated happy birthday
My daughter says yours is better, because it has horsies. 😃🏇🏽
Happy birthday
Bdubs: "how can I boost engagement?"  Also Bdubs: doubledown on something wrong and watch all the corrections fly in.
May I just say that this is the cutest looking Hermitcraft world yet.
I just got PTSD from Jorgen's death :(
Happy bday bdubs!!
hey bdubs! just fyi, you can instantly destroy powder snow with water, for future reference. glad to see the horse course coming back!
turns out, Etho was just slowing you down.
Happy belated birthday good sir! I'm glad you're feeling better.
Happy Birthday!  Hope you're feeling better and having a great day!
'This course WILL be played!'
I got some serious deja vu when I saw that thumbnail
Thanks for the content bdubs
B's singing reminds me of the singing that goes on in the show big mouth
Thrilled to see my favorite S8 build back! Still inspires my builds today.
Great episode and captivating ad read :)
BUBBLES :D
"protagonist is the bad guys, if you didn't know"  Who's gonna tell him?
You did an amazing job again
I did not go through high school and college literature courses just to be told that the protagonist is the bad guy. All jokes aside, I love these videos and I’m glad you’re feeling better.
Happy Belated Birthday Mr Bdubs, I do hope you have had an awesome day :)
The MADLAD did it!
Happy birthday 🎂
4:00 BDUBS ANTAGONIST IS BAD GUY, PROTAGONIST IS GOOD GUY OR MAIN CHARACTER!!! you remember because antagonists antagonize the main character
i love how bdoubles confused protagonist with antagentist
Happy B-Day Bdubs, glad the horse course is back ❤
Sooooo excited to see the horse course being revived! Kudos to Bdubs to knock this huge project out in one episode all by himself while still being sick. I hope you feel better now!  BTW just breed up horses from Etho I think he got two, no three horses in the pen now XD.
TIL Bdubs doesn't know the difference between antagonist and protagonist.
Oh silly Bdubs I think you meant antagonist
Beeduwbs singe coz; dare stick?
Its ANTAGONIST not PROTAGONIST please 3:30 i really hope you're doing the tango strat of getting something wrong to get more comments cause that hurt to hear.
Happy birthday bdoubs when is looked at the vid I thought that looked familiar
Aww, I'm so glad the horse course is back!!
When I saw the thumbnail. I thought this was an old video.😂
what was that laugh 05:55🤣
Oh bdubs, its ok we know English isn’t your strong suit. Antagonist is the bad guy
Return of the king "horse course"
bdubs protagonist is the good guy, antagonist is the bad guy
thought this was going to be a lost episode or something.
I so glad to see this. I felt so bad that y’all put so much into it last season and the stupid moon ruined everything before y’all could race. Get some rest. Ya done good.
Happy Belated
Wow, he actually managed to finish it. I was doubting you the entire episode till it was done!
Blimey Bdubs, epic job building the Horse Course pretty much block for block in a crazy short time! Happy belated B'day, I hope you had a good rest after this mammoth task ❤
So glad the Horse Course will get played!  Thats a Crazy amount of work for 1 Episode, dang!   Now comes the Glue Factory for the lesser Horses🐴
Great work! Now get some rest, fight off that cold, and look up the word "antagonist."  ;)
HORSE COURSE!!! Yay!!!!!
No one told him powdered snow was destroyed by water, did they?
What? It's a miracle!
I was so confused at the title and thumbnail,
People correcting protagonist to antagonist, remember the episode when he said the best way to get people to comment is do math incorrectly? B-Dubs is giga brain and he does it so flawlessly. I give you props good sir because yes it will give thousands more comments!!
Antagonist <-> Protagonist
I mean, Etho filled in his holes, whereas you didn't bdubs, so I guess Etho wins again ;-p
bubbles you using schematica??
Use water to instantly remove power snow
I like to believe that Bdubs things of himself as the antagonist, and that he’s the bad guy in the story   That’s amusing
Happy belated Birthday, BDubs
The moon comes down again this season?
Is not protagonist is antagonist pro everything good
i know they are ugly but i always like horse ladders.
Not to deflate your ego or anything, Bdubs, but the argument could be made that you were cribbing off of Etho's work (and your own) to port the Horse Course over to this season.  Meanwhile Etho was cribbing off his own work (and his work alone) to port in BattleBane.  Therefore.
With protagonists like these who needs antagonists?
i swear, everyone on hermitcraft is an absolute mad lad, my god...
my god bdubs is a mad man
Hey b-dubs, you probably already know this but just in case you don't: if you have to fly really far but you don't have many Rockets, fly straight up with your first rocket, then dive at a 45° angle, when you get near the ground go back up at a 45° angle and repeat. You can go way way further this way than any other and you'll barely use any Rockets
very nice to bring back horse course
The word antagonist went right over Bdubs poor little head...
Take that ancient Greece! BDubs made an entire Hippodrome in just a few days.
I’m dying to know if 9 rockets were enough to get home from Tangos piglin farm.
... you can use water to instantly clear powder snow...
Incredible work BDUBS! So glad the horse course is final getting used
Awesome to see the Horse Course back, I can't wait to see it played! And hey, Scar would agree that he is the protagonist at least. :D
i can't believe how much you got done in one episode!
"protagonist is bad guy" - uhbeedub
BDubs, you meant 'antagonist'.
bdubs that was a HUGE undertaking, very very empressive. Best wishes to you, the the course and to the charity event. Cheers from Chile
Such a shame the s8 horse course never got used! Hope this time it is!
BDubs is build a horse course? GG everyone, good season, see you all in season 10.
Happy birthday!
It’s a antagonist bdubs you silly big eye
Happy birthday! Hopy you have a great day
I was just thinking about how the horse course was never finished.
Happy belated birthday bdubs.
I am so hyped for the charity streams!!!
Hello!
Protagonists are heroes, Antagonists are villains lol
I swear bdubs is responsible for my niece walkin around sayin crastle and hoimycraft  Keralis its booshes
I'm impressed you got it all done Bdubs! It's going to be fun to watch it finally be played
doesn't water instabreak powdered snow?
pro·tag·o·nist /prōˈtaɡənəst,prəˈtaɡənəst/ noun the leading character or one of the major characters in a drama, movie, novel, or other fictional text. the main figure or one of the most prominent figures in a real situation. "in this colonial struggle, the main protagonists were Great Britain and France"
I’m gonna have to give it to etho on this one because he did it without the schematic mod
The amount of effort this took is insane! Bdubs you're CRAZY! (in the best way ❤️) can't wait for the charity streams!
Its so trippy to see a build from last season in s9 :p what? A time rift?
I hope people don't take his pettiness too seriously, it is just a joke
Happy birthday!
"Just one. More. Castle..." -bdubs the madman
itd be cool if later in the season you guys invited some of the Empires SMP players/other friends to come and play the mini games again :D Id love to see that!
I love Bdub’s ad readings. I bought Raycons based purely on seeing his unique and quirky ads. Love ‘em   Also, happy late bday bdubs!
Happy berthday Bdubs! also yes you are the best for doing this in one episode ; )
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BDUBS FROM NOT YOUR FRIEND!
Time permitting; I feel like the moonlamps that he purchased usage rights to for ambiance, along with the horse stick speed and snow jump checker need to make an appearance.  The hermits would be be able to test it out to find out what style of horse will best fit their chosen horse course technique. Either have a fast horse that doesn't jump quite as well or a slower horse that can do the jump portions easy peasy.
happy birthday
Bdubs does it again. Will never not love these videos.
Wow this is something bDubs has never done before
Every time he says “Prowess”, I hear SmallishBeans saying, “I AM TALL!”. LOL
So so so glad the horse course castle is having a new chance at life, it was a shame it never got used in S8  Also for a sec I thought we shared the same bday! I extend my bday wishes to all fellow october-babies in the comments
You did it!! For charity! 🎉🎉🎉
Watching this episode made my whole day better, especially seeing you so happy for doing all the redstone correctly xD Very excited to see the course get used during the event!!
happy late birthday bdubbs !
Grian’s Rift is bringing S8 Back, the last Season Mumbo was Here
Man, i appreciate you all grinding like you do. Just playing around on TU12 edition, i lose hours and have done nothing. lol. But when i "lock in" i can get petty stuff did.
Protagonist is bad? I thought antagonist was bad and protagonist was good. 🤔
This is so good to watch, the only downside is the wait between each episode, keep it up!
Belated Happy Birthday :D  And you are a mad lad for speedrunning the Horse Course 💪Glad to see it back :D the curse won't happen this time since you did it alone! Hmm I guess Etho wins? Horse Course is still half his... bested again? /j lol Awesome job and excited for the HC stream!
Great thumbnail, the way you put the text behind one of the spires looks awesome
"protagonist is bad guy, for those who don't know"  *sighs in english major*
Well, if it was really Etho talking to you, he wouldn't be asking why you're doing it, but why you're not using TNT.
Happy birthday from your not-friend <3
Bdubs being the antagonist that he is best suited for of course declares the protagonists as actually being bad guys. Classic projection.
Whose gonna tell him protagonist is good guy. Antagonist is bad guy
this is so crazy because i just finished watching yoh finish the s8 horse course this morning LOL! It looks like everyone is playing the hits with battle bane, dunk tank.. and now horse course! at least the hills arent hollow this time... right?  😉
Because of course you're an '82 baby. We are the best.
This is a monumental Minecraft film. Never have I seen such raw narrative drive and commitment to a good cause
The thumbnail confused me deeply
Happy belated birthday! My children are astonished to find you’re nearly my age… so take that how you will!   Hope you had as much fun as you bring us xx
Well if Etho gets involved the season is gonna end soon. But there is no better between Etho and Bdubs they are the dynamic duo. But I love the civil rivalry between yall.  Happy belated bdubs. Sry I'm not your friend   ) ;   I can't even remember my own birthday so be it.
Love ya to death, but not literally. Take it easy! It doesn't have to be a competition, but you and Etho are both winners in my heart.
When are you going to get half decent armour?
You can never tell if Bdubs is jus a top tier troll or genuinely doesn't know the difference between protagonist and antagonist lol
I'm so thrilled you brought the horse course back!!! And you did it near the beginning of the season so the horse course curse can't possibly happen again! Can't believe you did all that work while you were sick, huge props! Super excited to see you and Etho and the other hermits get to play it properly, the charity livestream is gonna be amazing
Finally!!!! We get to see The Horse Course  in action!!!!!!!
I was gutted we didn't get to see the course ran last season. Now because of our wonderful Bdubs we get to see it! I know it was already designed but completing a two person season long project in one episode is very very impressive. Thank you for all the hard work and joy! I'm very grateful and super excited.
Sorry you're still fighting that cold. I guess Season 9's track is the Hoarse Course?
When I saw the tumbnail, at first I thought that this was an old episode, but then I looked at the video premiere date and was like: "Is this a reupload?"
Good job moss man.
Actually antagonist is the bad guy 🤓🤓🤓
Happy Birthday Bdubs ❤🎉
ooooh so many cool games and now the horse course is back !!!!! I'm so excited for this Livestream !!!!
im getting deja vu from that thumbnail lol
I have a deja vu
I'm so glad to see a Bdubs episode... but did Bdubs think he only had until today to finish the course instead of until next week?
Hope you’re feeling better soon friend. Lovely to see the horse course again but no BIG MOON, please 😂 ❤❤❤
Happy Birthday!
getting a sense of deja vu here.... nethertheless, congrats on getting this whole thing done in one episode !!! (also, i wished you happy birthday with pictures of my homemade bdubs plushie - i'm a true fan i swear ! /lh)
"Before the MOON comes down and blows the whole planet up..." 🤣🤣
Antagonist*
Dude! Happy birthday!! Hope it was amazing, like you!!
happy birthday Sir Bdubs.. hope you enjoyed your day and that you're feeling better... always amazed by your designs and ideas.. wish i had 10% of that creativity... keep it up sir. always inspiring others to push their abilities and creativity..
Am I the only one who thinks that bdubs's views are getting lower and lower every video? His content is so underrated recently tbh.
It would be cool if you updated the trees with stripped Mangrove logs
Happy late birthday
hey, glad you’re feeling good enough to upload boss!! kick that sickness in the tush
This course will be in Mariokarts new DLC, can't wait
Haha I was so confused when I saw the horse course in the thumbnail. I'm so excited you brought it back! I was so bummed that it wasn't used last season
thought this was a s8 video at first
People sprinting to the comments to correct bdubs: it's antagonist Bdubs: "Ah yes my genius plan is working"
They brought back the dislike video option, hooray.   Obviously unnecessary on a bdubs video. And what kind of monster would I be to click the dislike on Bubbles birthday? I mean, sure, we've all seen this content before, in season 8. And maybe, he didn't need to cut corners on the packed snow. And he did sort of challenge an etho build, with a build that was technically also an etho build... ahem.  No, no, of course I can't hit the dislike for any of those reasons. But it is real close to the like button, and who knows, maybe my finger shripped. No. it's for charity... And she's a real talented dancer. Happy birthday BdoubleO100.
I was so confused by the thumbnail. Good job!
Bdubs did you know if you breed two horses while they have swiftness and jump boost potion affect it will carry on to the baby? I know it works in bedrock, you should give it a shot.
HAPPY 40th BIRTHDAY BDUBS!!! <3
bdubs the horse murderer
BDubs, your wife is a much better advertiser than you! There, I said it!
Happy Belated Bday Bdubs!!
Just whitelist some patrons who want to help and send limetica layout ... For charity and sickness
Happy belated birthday!!!
Yea nah Protagonist is the bad guy for who are confused Bdubs got the right direction but he is a little... um... Confused
No way bdubs is 40. You look so youthful man
I am happy we will get to see the amazing racecourse again ... Good work Bdubs
I haven’t watched the video yet, but it would make me very happy to see it back on hermitcraft as no one ever played it
Etho smetho! Your the best bdubs! 😊
Scar gave all the hermits a strict deadline for something, and instantly created the most powerful team in the world.
All this intense last minute work is giving me serious college flashbacks lol
Bdubs has gone crazy lol
Bdubs is the best
Holy moly - from the thumbnail alone I already thought "Aw, that looks pretty derivative from the horse course from last season." But never could I imagine that you'd bring it back block for block!?!?!? Wow. Amazing BDubs.
For future reference a fire bow will eat through any powdered snow you hit with it
Antagonist* (:
The new pass n gas got firework show bdubs ... Keralis should have a sign
BDUBS THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
so excited for the hourse corse
If Bdubs says a protagonist is a bad guy, then a protagonist is a bad guy. The English lexicon simply must adjust.
I'm getting such a Déjà vu from this tumbnail
A real PewDiePie moment at the start. R.I.P. Joergen 27. 😓
Bdubs, I’m certain Etho is quite proud of your perfect redstone prowess…!😉 So glad to see this masterpiece completed!   Seriously, it’s clever and gorgeous!!!✨
i wanna hear that song on my spotify
De ja vu is acting up
um bdubs the bartering farm you went to is not tango's current one. its the one next to it that is the current one
Antagonist is bad guy protagonist is main character
Bdubs belongs on broadcast TV/Radio
He's completely right that the protagonist is bad, at least from his perspective lol (Bdubs is perpetually playing the heel!)
For the future: water will make powdered snow disappear
Awh Bdubs, my 40th was on 10/5. Happy 40th to us!!!
brunswick the antagonist is the bad person of the story and happy birthday!
Dude he literally remade it all daaaaamn
HAPPY BIRTH BDUBS!!!🎉  (even though im not your friend)
Pro tip B. Use water to remove powedered snow. But you probably already know that. Now that I think about it you taught me that.
bdubs always horsing around
Happy bday bdubs  Thanks for all the amazing content you give us. Hope you have/had an amazing day.
always love your commmmmercial breaks bdubs <3
Wow! What a very coarse horse course you got there
what does lava do to snow
Use camels my dude
Hoymicraff!
I'm so soon here that Mumbo is back
hi bdubs from 11:06 happy birthday!! :D <3
DEJA VU ?!?!??!
I forgot what episode it was, but sometime this season bdubs alluded to the horse course coming back, I’m so happy it will, that was one of the most anticipated unfinished things in S9
I saw the thumbnail And thought its an old recommended episode 😅
Severe deja vu from that title and thumbnail. Hmm...
Happy b-day bdubs!
HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY 🎂🎂🎂🎂🎉🎉🎉🎉 (please be my friend 🥺)
Happy birthday
happy late bday
The goat is back love your videos bdubs
First Battle Bane, now the Horse Course! This charity stream is a real blast from the past!
New Bdubs episode, let's goo!
Hermitcraft wouldn't be complete if there's not an unfinished Horse Course.
"protagonist is a bad guy" Ah yes, the classic youtuber strategy to say something wrong on purpose to boost video interactions in the comments. Since I am leaving one, it clearly works!
AGAIN???
Dejavu
its antagonist not protagonist lol
Who’s gonna tell bdubs protagonist is the main character and antagonist is the bad guy 😭
Watching Bdubs say he's going to build a new horse course is like watching Sisyphus find a new boulder to push.
I'm amazed. I never expected to see the hourse course again. I'm so excited.
Antagonist is bad guy, Bdubs
GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK!!!
Antagonist is the bad guy. Protagonist is the main character.
im assuming he meant antagonist lmao
pro·tag·o·nist /prōˈtaɡənəst,prəˈtaɡənəst/  the leading character or one of the major characters in a drama, movie, novel, or other fictional text
Protagonist is just the guy the story is about. Good or bad
i missed the horse course so much
Everybody loves a "bad guy" protagonist! All the Hermits are super impressive, but no one impresses me more than Sir BDoubleO.
No one has finished this video yet 😢
“Protagonist is bad guy, just so you know” - BDOUBLEO100 2022
SO HAPPY TO SEE YOURE DOING BETTER!! 💜
Bdubs..... yeeyyysss
New hyoeiumekrwap episode, yihaa
No way?!!!
INCREDIBLE!! I’m so excited to see horse course
"protagonist is bad guy" no silly that's antagonist
looks great
Wait this feels familiar. I guess my time machine worked.
Bdubs uploaded!
We all know Dubs is the one with the actual real power in Hermitcraft; King Ren is just a façade
...antagonists...? 🤗 🥰
“Protagonist is bad guy, for those of you who don’t know.”  He’s a little confused, but he’s got the spirit. *Antagonist* was the word you were looking for, BDubs 😉
I wondered how a season eaght episode got in my recomendations..
Love the vid b dubs!! Antagonist is the bad guy not the protagonist lol but we all make mistakes. Love the vid and great job!!
Do you mean “antagonist” bdubs 😭
Antagonist B-Dubs. The bad guy is the Antagonist lol. Protagonist is the good guy.
the protagonist is the main character of a story. they're only your enemy if You are the antagonist, bdubs!
surely its antagonist not protagonist no?
Hello
Antagonist?
"protagonist is bad guy, for those of you that don't know."  - bdoubleo100
"Protagonist is bad guy if you don't know."  Who's gonna break it to poor Bdubs?
3:40 I think you mean antagonist Bubbles! :D   (ps, happy bday! 🎉)
This is one of those builds that when I first saw in season eight I hated, but even before this episode I looked back and was really impressed by this mixing of colors. It has inspired me to build with more vibrant colors, and one color combination that I'm exited for is yellow with red roofs. It shouldn't work, but it does.
What an awesome vid!
welcome back bdubs!!
aren't protagonists the good guys??
Now all we need is Etho to help out and then the horse course will never be finished!
woo! Hope you are feeling better.
Am I tripping
Let’s go he’s back
Happy late birthday bdubs! Glad to see you back!
You should call your Horse Course "Of Course"
I'm feeling sick today and now I get a bdouble video? Instantly got me feeling somewhat better!
Bdubs!! So glad you're feeling better! 💚
me double checking whether or not he accidentally uploaded an episode from s8 😂
BDUBS!! its so good to have you back! :D hope youre feeling better <3
Wouldnt be a season of hermitcraft without a Bdubs horse course!
Season 8 fans: hey, I’ve seen this one before! Season 9 fans: what do you mean you’ve seen it? It’s brand new!
I was shocked by the thumbnail 😳, I've never seen such an amazing and mesmerizing base!!!!!!
Welcome back, boss
Woo it still says "No views", early
Missed you Bdubs! :3
❤
Thanks!
ahhhh yes, hoimeycraft time.
Ah yes a horse course! Splendid!
THE HORSE COURSE COMEBACK?!!??
Return of the king!! Glad you’re feeling better. :)
Every days a good day when bdubz uploads
Wow an amazing Bdubs video to complete my weekend

The term Hoymicraft needs to be marked down in hermit history
That thumbnail looks familiar…
