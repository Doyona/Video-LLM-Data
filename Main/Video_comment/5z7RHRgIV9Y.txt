love my fellow danes ^-^
That Haaland goal was clean.
francis ngganu anthony joshua
Unbelievable unbeatable 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Copenhagen GK 😮 he needs to use his hands
Very suspicious keeper, go collect ur winnings
Comfortable victory in the hat for the quarter finals easy work over two legs back 2 back champions leagues incoming ️️
city, my local team
Akanji. Giant body, tiny head.
very good score
Wonder if they will get drawn to fsce liverpool.... oh wait 😂
0:52 No-one ever, *ever* wants to see Robbie Savage's face.
Another training session complete  C’mon City 💪💪💪
Rodri is immensely good
Rodri is ridiculously good. Nobody as good as him in world football
It might have only been a consolation but that Copenhagen goal was class 👏
*if the goalie took his spa mask off he’d see the ball*
Alvarez is shockingly lethal around goal
lets go, that goal was sick! 🙌⚽️
That's 60 not out for rodders 😅
Haaland scored that goal wih ease
Cheats
Good game to watch
Great game
Yo
Look how empty the stadium is 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 that is embarassing omg how ridiculous this is the biggest banter club alive 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ronaldo ucl record will be getting smashed out the park 👏
Alvarez the best!!!
I think Haaland could score a few more if be does shots like that, similar to how Mbappe does it
Half empty stadium, petrodollar plastic club hammering another club, players kicking it about like a training match in the last 16 of Uefas premier tournament… everything that’s wrong with the game right here folks♟️
So many bots in these comments what’s going on
if we are found guilty of the 115 charges will we only lose the premier league trophies and keep the champions league trophy/trophies?
Sergio will always be better than Haaland
The ain't copen after this loss
Every day haaland can only score tap ins? Explain tht goal then….
Cities attendance 😂
Madrid or Arsenal are going to be the only teams that can stop these cheaters from winning another tainted CL cup this year.
ff
Let’s see what happens on Sunday 👍🏻🩵
Shocking atmosphere for a Champions League night 😐😶
City's defense is still not quite good. I would be surprise if they get to final
I was there just yesterday on the TV
Why is the blatant wresting NOT being penalised ?  and its ruining the game.......
The Juggernaut rolls on be interesting to watch them play Real Madrid .👋👋
ALVAREZ OMG
I went to the game with my school, it was amazing results
Dont see anyone stopping City in the champions league! Ridiculous
City are boring tbh they need a billion pounds to win a treble ffs 😅
Bore fest.
Still waiting for the 115 breaches …
115 charges
115 charges
Tbf the goalie can't see properly with that mask on lol
Copenhagen goal was dope ❗
I was there, the light show before the game was out of this world! And the away fans were unbelievable all game
if city dont win the premier league and the champions league this season then they can only be considered flops
FC Copenhagen Scottish International Goalie unfortunately had a Varied Game 🩴
😂❤
0:57 felt that the commentators were quite harsh there,Alvarez’s shot was flying incredibly fast and the keeper tried his best ig
Copenhagen just rolled over and got smashed! Pathetic.
Very competitive game, nothing to do with the billions spent over the last 10 years. Well done Man City a tribute to great scouting and coaching.
Mbappes clear loool even his swag tops pooland.
Akanji got better finishing then haaland lol
Akanji should of got a pen for that
For me, Haaland is the greatest striker on the planet!! An amazing goal-getter!
Shocking keeper
Why has Copenhagen keeper turned up dressed like hes got a mascarade party after the game 😂
United did well against them 😂
Come n city
Those corner deliveries by Julian Alvarez today were different hot sauce. Could easily  of had 4 assists. Really going under the radar.
“Dad , what was it like watching Peps Man City dominate for a decade”   “ boring “   😂😂😂
Manchester is blue
Keeper must be ballet or something like that .usseles keeper not for top level
9 year cheats
They have the most fans in the world
Another Tap in from haaland.
Arsenal, Barca, Inter and Dortmund will make the next round draw🔥
BLIB BLOB BLIBEDDY BLOO
Even city fans are bored
City conceding a lot of chances recently👀
Haaland hitting form now🔥🔥
Clean sweep. Rest the players for a massive game against Liverpool this weekend. Can’t wait for that.
Can’t even fill their stadium for a European game 😂 such a fake club
Man City = corruption
Messi king 🤴
Nice warm up for Anfield. We gotta bring it.
Rashford get a 2 yr extension for that one strike. Absolute waste of space. City are miles ahead of United. All that ffp talk is for the little simps.
LOL Hals goal was about as FU as can get. People talking about Copenhagens goal ignore the fact City did it better x3. Not from a city fan btw
Even Onana wouldnt make that mistake
City don't look the same this year but they can still win it with the players they have.
i was there what a win blues🩵
Grabara pulling a Karius 😂
City will get another easy draw
Magnificent Haaland yet again. (I'm a former Red who transferred over after over 55 years BTW - who can resist supporting such a team as this?))
Why the mask?
Alvarez' corners were an absolute beauty. So much power, curl and accuracy. Imagine if he had scored directly from that one corner😮
Copenhagens keeper has been taking lessons from Onana
CITY ARE SHTY CHRATER MAN ARE UNITED
Bayern, City and Madrid favourites.
Getting gassed over Copenhagen’s goal… they’re out. Nothing to appreciate 🤡🤡🤡🐸☕️
I have a feeling Manchester City are gonna either equal or beat Real Madrids hatrick of UCL's.
City love a 3-1
watching football like this is a pleasure. Sadly here in Scotland to many teams play as though they are wearing wellie boots
Of course they are going to win it again lol without lfc in that comp the only real team that can match is madrid. Man City will keep winning that now till they are finally stripped off it all.
Rodri is ridiculously good. Nobody as good as him in world football
City atmosphere pathetic
We already knew City would go through! 😅
115 FFP
Copenhagen fans were so big headed knocking utd out now have some of city lol
Bat man in goal wtf
Karius in disguise?
Man City Are the team to beat
MAN CITY KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK 💙🌟⭐🌟⭐⭐
MAN CITY💙 WELL DONE,  A EXCELLENT AKANJI GOAL 🔥🔥WAS A BIT UPSET TO SEE RODRI START BECAUSE  I THORT HE WOULD REST FOR A BIG GAME ON THE WEEKEND..🙏🙏🙏🙏
Quietest stadium in the champions league up untill copenhagen scored 😂
City were still a bit lucky .. last shot on goal shpuld have been top right corner ..cop had 2 good chances .. if there ladt shot was passed to the right earlier iy was a goal
Liverpool beat the Sunday easily
boring fake rich club m city a fact
Haaland is he for real
Man city defence is horrible.
Comfortable victory in the hat for the quarter finals easy work over two legs back 2 back champions leagues incoming 👏🔵⚪️🔵⚪️
Haaland picking the goalie's left side, that's kinda cheating!
I dlatego Grabara nie gra w reprezentacji
Halaand scored that like he was in training 😂
Its getting kind of boring now Man City winning all the time thats why i dont watch them anymore no disrespect but it would be nice to see them get beat now and again make them more dare i say more human.
Akanji goal was on a another level
Man City back to back Champions League winners. Unstoppable, from a Toon fan. 👍🏻
So many empty seats. Embarrassing club
Alvarez corners were immense today
Ok
Come on City! Let's show our goal power at Anfield 💙
Goalkeepers bank accounts need auditing
Congrats to the 10 year old club Man City 🎉
City are so boring
🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈🦈
LaLaLand
Glad to see the Emptyhad doesnt change always empty look at all those blue empty seats 😂
such a dead atmosphere for a champions league night
Chelsea the team to beat ⚽
Can’t see anyone beating city other than arsenal.
Lol was this a surprise they always get easy teams
city, my local team
The Copenhagen goal was just beautiful
Kane isn't better then Erling😂
Honestly haaland hardly any supply this game and still manages to find a goal he's an incredible goalscorer. Bobb looks a good player but he doesn't have his head up if he could find the pass he'd be a world class player eventually.
Another boring win for City. Hate that all their players have a smile on their faces all because they dominate...
Why are people Creaming over City who acc thought they would lose to Copenhagen.
mbappe special that haaland goal
Man City are so boring
copenhagen goal keeper is 2% better than Manchester united Onana 😂😂😂
💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘💘
City like Chelsea ruined football. Outspent everyone at the start tore Barca dna. They don’t even deserve 1 UCL and now the club with 115 charges pending are going to be back to back champions. Feel sick call me a hater it’s true
As a city fan I certainly enjoyed how Copenhagen played today! 🩵
Sick first goal like one of my shorts
No underdog stories yet. I guess we'll have to wait for Arsenal to try and win against Porto
Empty-had ain’t even a joke. Never seen so many empty seats. Deadest club
Does TNT respond?!?!?!?!?!
Lets be honest, who really thought Copenhagen were going to win??
oil fc back at it again 🙄
Man City going to defend this shiz 🔥
Yahh
That Haaland goal was clean.
Alvarez a goal and an assist! Nice to see him getting back into form. Hopefully will score a couple vs Liverpool!
That akanji goal was so composed
Lets goooo city 💙💙
It’s gonna be hard to stop City, especially with how experienced they now are
hehe
Akanji is so underrated
Man city 💙💙💙💙
First!
