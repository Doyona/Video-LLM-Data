HUGE thanks to Shelby American and Bill Pierre Ford for making this happen! I’m sure a lot of you can guess, but what do you think we are going to do to this 👀🤔 Let me know in the comments below 👇🏼 Make sure notifications are ON so you don't miss the next two videos!
That has to be the best looking "modern" Ford truck of all time! I love the old Ford pickups an really only cared for a few of the newer ones, ie.. The Lightning an a few others. I love pickups and have real fondness for the old Mustangs as that is what I grew up with and driving. Kinda embarassed to admit I didnt even know this truck existed until seeing a youtube video about cocky drivers, but am glad I did! So awesome you were able to get one of only 250, thats crazy.
Surprised this video don’t have 1m views 🔥
id like to also say that carroll shelby also gave money towards founding the chilis restaurants
So you didn’t get a supercharged one?
This Shelby truck looks so much better in a single cab IMO.
Incredible video, very well put together
Niceeeeeeee thats fireee 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Props to you and yours. Your production has hit the next level.
Damn these boys know what they are doing!!!!! 🔥🔥
Surprised that it doesn’t come with led lights , but that’s my dream truck bro . Awsome!!!
This video made me feel a certain kind of way. I just got back from basic training and so I’ve been catching up on videos and I was so excited about this one and it certainly did not disappoint!
Most of this information was from the movie Ford vs Ferrari
I’m very impressed with the production of this video and can’t wait to see the progress of the super snake
I live literally right next to the shelby place😂😭
No way
Did you go to the Rod Run with is or was this truck in rod run
Can't believe I missed my opportunity to see yall in my city
Love the truck😈😍
You got to make a new edge drift/burnout mustang
AYYYYYY BILL PEIRE!!! SEATTLE! SEATTLE! SEATTLE!!
I'm gonna say it like it is bud. The video was inspiring and  wants me to push harder to get where I want in life. One of the best videos so far. Makes me want to improve my car to be the fastest (even if that's impossible) I want to do what you can and be good at it. Purse my dream of making beautiful cars, trucks and modding them. One day...
My dream job is to work for Shelby American come hell or high water ima make it to that point in my life
Like watching a God damn movie
Pls reply
U should race   @freddylsx
Damn it Gavin. Why you make me cry with the monolog. Then I get hit again with the stunning editing and camera work. T_T
Congrats, it's a beauty.
I pulled up and saw that truck while i was there no way wtf that’s so awesome
You're gonna wanna swap that drain plug for a ronin if you haven't already, the newer gen plugs suck!
Best video I’ve ever seen
You bought a n/a Shelby ? 🤣🤣🤣
Deep down all I feel is Satan's motor being put into this truck and just because of this homage to Shelby, it'll be the fastest truck and never break down
This is best video you guys have made thanks for the content.
No supercharger on it? That sucks.
its insane how you´ve gone from a v6 camaro to this, i still remember everything and honestly It gives me hope that one day I might make it somewhere
Damn this video makes me fall in love with shelby’s even more!! Very impressive
Ty finally someone bought n put a real Shelby truck on yt hope u don’t stop there n get something besides the basic cobras n do a real roush n or saleen not that the cobra gt500’s rnt cool but they’re everywhere let’s see something different
I remember when u started back in 2018 now im Back!
Where is Ondgas video?????
The ultimate takuache truck
So this shelby truck has 4wd?? I thought the supersnakes only had rwd
This mans said let me just make buying an absolutely ridiculous and beautiful truck into a fucking TV production. These camera angles. 100%
Those halogen headlights are trash on such a good looking truck.
Damn son making moves... I STILL REMEMBER WHEN U GOT SLAMMED ON THE HOOD BY A COP NOW LOOK AT YOU 💪💪💪💪
Bad ass video, one day.. one day.
YO, loved that "subtle" hint LOL... so... Turbo? LOL :-)
Did anyone else get a Forza Horizon intro vibe 🤔
Man this video edit is one of the best videos I have ever seen
Hell yea man. You deserve it. This truck will be a monster when you’re done. Keep spreading this positive energy man.
Amazing video
Ok major props on the history edit on this video really wasent expecting that very cool
Congratulations!  I have a Ruby Red one I bought new last October. Mine is #145.
I almost missed it...wait did i...this one ISN'T supercharged for a reason?! Oh shiiiiiiit
You didn’t stop at a hotel in Kansas did you?😂 I’m out here for work and I came outside and was like no way that’s a shelby truck
Don’t give this one away 🤣
I saw a black one on the interstate a week ago in Shreveport Louisiana
Why does it not have blue HID lights
Dude i saw it in shelby americans factory
He maid a Shelby Commercial
Nice video 👍
1 of a million rare vehicles or another 1 of a million.
Great truck my dad has the 2018 ford super snake  damn thing is a beast . Shelby built one hell of a truck
bro the camera work and editing is fucking insane.  jeez
I felt like I was at a movie theater 😂
I miss the old into I been here for a long time ;*
The editing thou😭❤️🙏🏻👏🏻
That intro touched my soul.
Fkin-a @6Media, AMAZING JOB 👏
FYI 67 gt500s had 428s not 427s
Whole vid the guy was smiling that’s one hell of a truck
This is going to be awesome.
This was the best movie I’ve ever seen! Way more the a YouTube video. Keep up the amazing work boys. -James
I created an account just to like this video
Those outdated halogen headlights are a shame. 1950 technology on such an awesome truck with no upgrade available from the factory. If people think I’m being a yuppie I drive daily up to 150 mph while stationed in Germany and live about 5 minutes from a no speed limit, almost no traffic road and most of the 85 miles on my weekend visits to family are unrestricted A-bahns. LED lights make all the difference in the world and even though this truck isn’t built for this environment any high dollar vehicle should have at a minimum the best lighting available. Not only for safety but they look kick azz as well.
That's a bad bitch...
I think that's the only f150 I'd drive
Ok ok I’m intrigued. You have my attention.
100k RCSB awesome 😅😅
Name it “maniac”
This man is going places🙏🏼
Your team has amazing video editing skills.... Truly amazing. Love all of your content!
words of motivation
Beautiful truck, and the video came out on my birthday! Can't wait to see what you do with it! Cinematography was on point!
Not supercharged???? LAME!!!! ;)
She is a beauty 🥴
I dont care what anyone else thinks. This truck is actually the new Era lighting. Not that crap ford is trying to do with the electric truck
Editing is next level
the best intro ever made by the 6 team!!
love that you drove the truck back
Take it off-roading
Wide Body Super Snake
I think I saw this on twitter
Cars/pickups like this are Almost impossible to own Here in Sweden, due to taxes and fuel prices.
Video quality is just something else
your making movies now as videos
All the hype in your last video was well worth the wait!!!!! 🛻 💨
Dam that was top quality
Has he never heard of a lightning
6:04 I loved that.
That truck is so clean 😳
That was like watching a cross between a Motortrend and a Top Gear production. Not bad from when this channel was just a go pro strapped to his forehead. Great job with the production quality!
Honestly the intro got me in my feels😕
holy crap that editing
I hope they thanked the dude that suggested tho buy  that truck
Your the reason why I got my 5.0 maybe the reason I get my truck
Crazy I just started wanting a Ford lightning guess it’s a sign
Now you gotta put a side exit exhaust out of both sides and of course the loudest best sounding exhaust Corsa mufflers and Big Quad 4 inch tips
I litterally just sounded like a gorilla when I saw that shelby 1,000 clip, I love those things , 1 of 25 and 2 of which are held there at the facillity
You are one lucky man to have all these toys. I can’t believe owning all these Shelby’s. You inspire a lot of people and encouraged are work. You’re such an inspiration. Thank you for letting us see and understand these amazing machines!
Loving the edit 🔥
Now we. Need a Shelby bronco what do you think of that
The production quality of your team is unmatched. My hat is off to the guys.
I have one too!! Iconic Silver #157! Badass trucks!  PNW !! Oregon! Oh and they only made about 150 due to the Virus! Can’t wait for More videos.
That was a whole ass movie
Bro the quality and editing it takes to make this kind of video and make it look so good in epic it makes me feel like I’m watching a little movie this is why I love watching itsjustasix
give it like 2 weeks and you'll hear "for this next giveaway, enter to win my Shelby Truck"
It’s going to be interesting what you all have your sleeves with this build
what an intro :O
Ur editing gave me chills brooo ur made it sooooo mf dope
was like the beginning of a movie..  I hope you do something to that motor cuz theres a who lotta room under that hood more then enough for twin turbos
Damn wish I coulda said hi to you guys while you were down here.
Sucks that the Chevy race truck is gonna be forgotten now, this is a sick truck tho. I’m a yenko man myself. But ole Shelby was one of the best. Oh shits it four wheel drive ? That’s gonna make it five times cooler.
Awesome video bro and that truck is absolutely amazing! Can't wait to see what you do with it!
Manual swap???
What the hell you planning on doing to this truck y’all? I’m legit scared
Killed the editing great job
Next giveaway car
Cool video! I posted a video about Shelby today, and I recommend watching it too. 🔥🔥!
You better not sell this bc you will probably never get to own one again
I bet they love lucifer
That truck is the meanest look car ive seen on this channel
Hell yeah my fav truck that will ever come out
love how mans got to the top, & didnt leave a single homie behind 🔥🔥🔥
Very very nice cuts
The quality of the 6 crews sidi visual just media period is always so 🔥!!!! High Quality Content Always
Another vehicle ruined or unfinished by a YouTube personality . Ass hats
This video was really dope man! The work that goes into these videos is flawless and impressive!
An absolutely dope edit
That was some damn well done production👌 can't wait for the content
Pumped for this build!!
are they really that rare? I see a white one with blue stripes in Toronto all the time
Dude I am having goosebumps watching this video such a cool edit and content man
Been a while since I watched just been busy
Yoo I was about to say that shit was wayyy too high quality not to have credits or something. Then roll the credits 😂 spoke too soon. Good shit Gavin and everyone at the itsjusta6 team.
Here comes a turbo super snake
so f**** dope !! can’t wait to hear the corsa on it 🥶🥶
Nice movie
No i'm not crying! It's because from cutting onions....
Everyone knows that Carroll Shelby would’ve had a smile on his face if he saw how far Shelby has gone from then to now
Congratulations man! I’m actually more interested in the Shelby F150. Here’s my big question for ya, is it Auto or Manual?
dude! My boyfriend and I were just in vegas and you were there!? omg!❤️
You should be making shelby's commercials
Itsjusta6 DUDE!!! This is like the greatest video on YouTube!!!! GREAT edit with the truck and the finale is outstanding!!! Wish I could meet you guys fr been watching you since day 1! Can’t wait to see what you do with this one 😎
Damn editing in this vid. AWESOME
Black headlight housings
Haha i worked at bill Pierre when I was a teenager. Can't believe they had this truck.
idk, im a chevy guy lol
At 8:46 u can see he did a burnout already lol
One of the best vids I’ve seen in a while ngl
You better not give the Shelby truck away
It’s crazy that Shelby had to make supercharged and non supercharged versions of this truck for states with emissions crazy difference in horsepower also non boosted one has 395hp and boosted is 770hp crazy so turbo one should do four digits I bet
is this the next race truck???????????.....
Man... this gave me goosebumps
This is so fucking awesome
This was like watching a documentary, I literally never once wanted to click off the video, very well put together!
You’re a very good communicator!
amazing
This gave me goosebumps. Loved the video
All that hype just to get gapped by a trx 😓
Did ken miles die in a accident
Seattle yeah buddy my home town
It’s just Ford don’t y’all know what that stands for found on road dea— wait wrong one here it is fucking insane road destroyer
I clicked so fast when I see this in my feed awesome video I want one of these but at the same time I would rather build my own
It felt like I was watching a movie. There was nothing about this video that I didn't like. Everything was on point. This was a very impressive video.
I wanna see this go up against boosted Chris f150 out here in Cali
Fun fact not all thelby trucks are supercharged its an option. Also i work with a guy that has a 4 door all black shelby and its freakin beautiful!  Those two trucks would look amazing together and what an small chance to have a single cab and a crew cab shelby trucks together! :D oh and his is supercharged from factory! Wonder How they would do side by side.
It’s nice I just wish they Shelby would have a used a higher trim model
This is a cinematic masterpiece from start to finish.
Fuck it. Quitting my job tomorrow and following my dreams.
All they need is a car name after his name and it’s gonna sell out
Anyone else have a feeling this is going to be the next big giveaway?
Can't wait for the future
Yo why was this so cinematic though
This is gonna be epic.
Wow it’s crazy how long Shelby lived!!!! Always keeps strong even when you lose a legend. Don’t let you down even though it’s sad.
This video gave me chills you guys have came so far
wiw never whatched a vidio like this plz do more off these as it had my heart beating with enjoyment,exsitment and many other thing see people you can acomplish your dreams you can reach the top just follow these footsteps get your dream job do what you want live life only got 1 chance so live your dreams yet again i just wanna say thatnks for them sinumatics and keep crushing life it was sooooo intence
bro you literally are living my dream
No way... I live in vegas, I saw this truck driving on the street. Who woulda thought it was you lmao
I feel like I’m watching fucking top gear mixed with a advertisement for fucking Shelby bleh
where do i vote to have this thing wrap matched with lucifer
Peter Brock once said to me as he signed some collectables i have of his.. Quote: follow your dreams not someone else`s.. Enjoy.. thanx to peter ive never followed anyone else`s footsteps and Mr Shelby is right, you will never make a dam dime till you do what you want.. ps: i so luv the new truck ;) Satan`s combo would be a nice hop up for the truck or steal Doug`s motor lol
Is it weird that I just saw one in my campground this morning I don’t know if it was fake but it had striped and said Shelby and it was red
It’s not the last one ahahahahah
Bro if you do end up working with whitem3 this will be a monster
The fact that there will be a few people in life that think that will be  regular truck just dont sit right with me.....
Haven’t watched a vid in 5 months and this makes me wanna watch everything
You need to hit up Midnight performance in Houston to make that F150 fast! I been asking for a 10 speed f150 for ever I can’t wait to see what you finally do with it!
I seen that Shelby in the museum
This is the only Ford of any kind I would ever own. This is the cleanest looking truck that's been built as a factory vehicle.
Cinematics are on another level!!!
Suped up f1 shitty
Me for being from Louisiana its hard for me to think that theres a person up north with a crazy life that I would live and soon will be.
The production of this video was insane!, literally of the highest quality, 6 Media are going a long way. Best of luck and congrats on the truck cant wait to see what you guys do.
your editor deserves a raise for this
Take it to Midnight performance From Texas 💯
All I can say is...WOW.
He really twin turboed the mclaren
100k truck!! At least put leds on it
Nom,  Noms!!
Very good video y’all. Fantastic work.
filming to editing is perfect !
Coolest truck I've seen in a while.. totally should be called a Shelby GT-150
you got me sold
Maybe a turbo build coming up for this bad bih 👀
Bro i felt like i was watching a documentary
What a well put together video <3 Shelby all time greatest I love the mustang the 2013 is my favorite
Tell me you made it without telling me you made it❤️
Shelby is an amazing person to look up to but don’t forget about our boy smokey nagata going 200mph in a Supra in the uk
Wrong, its 250 of them for every year, if you have the 2020 then there is another 250 for the 2021
This is an awesome video Gavin, its actually an interesting way to tell history
Those rear suspension joints are going to catch something and die lol
Better not give this away
If that showed I’m up in my driveway one day, I would kneel over and die on the spot. I hope I get to own something like that one day.
this gave me goosebumps
Did he ever finish his first white truck 😂
😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
Next giveaway truck?
That is a gorgeous truck, can't wait to see what yall have planned 👀
Well my hard work is for nothing I was working hard for that truck now I can’t get it cause that was the last one
This video made me feel like y’all was about to create a need for speed special edition but it’s a really impressive video
Bro this thing gona be insane no doubt
The quality of your videos are so insanely good, I remember the first video I’ve ever watched of yours being about headlights for the 5.0
This channel has changed me on how I look at cars etc. I am so glad I found this channel. If there is one person I wanted to meet would be Mr. Shelby the man himself! Brought the most iconic vehicles for everyone to experience. R.I.P Shelby Legends Never Die
I bet harry is pissed 🥴🥴
I can think of so many better cars than a American built car.
I love this🙌🏿
One of the best segments to introduce Shelbys... amazing
New vid up!!! Go check it out
I am astounded. The first 4:20 of this video had me with goosebumps, with how well you did that history lesson, and then the cinematic shots right after it. Damn, keep that up man, and you will reach sub levels you could never dream of.
congratz
the editing was bussin🥵
Hi man let make it happen I’m be Ford Shelby lover never owned one but your boy has dreams check me out Xavier Mccree
I wanna learn about that Shelby 1000 that was in the video
It’s like almost watching a damn movie 🍿
You all are so blessed to have this opportunity! Wow! Definitely jealous of that truck! Completely sick!
Have me crying in the intro.
Hell yea  6 finna  out do Shelby America in there own truck
5 years from now there making movies 🤣
That is my dream truck unfortunately I will never be able to afford one. Retired U.S.ARMY  SSG Brown, Micah S 19K30/31B30
So is this build going to be sponsored by Shelby America? Or are they going to make you spend your own money on the build? I’m very interested to see what happens next. And congratulations, I’ve been subbed since you were at 800. I still have the messages we sent back and forth on Instagram. Love watching you grown and progress.! Don’t lose sight.
Yo lowkey wanted to cry
Jealous!
that intro gave me chills holy fuck
Won't be the last. They will come out with a better version in the future like all cars
0:52 I swear the guy with sun glasses in this picture is a time traveling Adam LZ. 😂
So when are y’all going to make a movie? Ha
Nice video
This or the Srt 10 truck??
"Post Malone of all people" ?
Boy have you come a long way man!👍🏽  Hey what are those weird bars hanging under the back?  Wow what a SUCK STORY so far still watching..good for you !! 🙌
Yeah there’s an identical shelby on my local marketplace
Ford > Chevy and Dodge
“Is this stuff for your hands or your dishes? BOTH”
This video ALMOST made me a Ford guy!
What fucking intro ❤️🥺👌🏼
This was like one long commercial
BADD ASŞ VIDEO PRODUCTION 👀👌🏼👌🏼💯💯
Guy in my area windsor ontario has a blue and black stripped one that's Whippled, baddest trucks every made imo
Wow. This guy is living a dream.  Ecstatic for him, but can't help but feel a twinge of depression.  Carbon monoxide poisoning ruined me being able to ever get this far.
this was a 11 min movie
Gavin really needs to be a documentary talker
Not even a truck guy but this is amazing!
Amazing Video!!!! Really can’t wait to see the build
How did no one notice that the engine looked like it’s been dropped, and sent out to be built for destruction!!!
Suprise us were watching
Best fucking intro_!
Some of the best editing yet! Great video!
Its about time!!
My daughter was born on 911 during the collapse of the twin towers and in remembrance in honor to what happened in  America on that day her second name is Shelby 😉✌️
Your videos are like a movie 🤩🤩
Fire video
Just so you know.....   The United States flag behind the truck is flipped in the wrong direction,  "The union" AKA field of stars, is always to be displayed on the left and not to the right when hung vertically on a wall....
I was related to carrol Shelby sadly I never got to meet him
Don’t make this a give away I wanna see this in the years to come 😑
Good luck finding parts
$100,000 truck with old halogen headlights 😂
Is this a billion dollar movie? I cant tell
I was just at Shelby last week. Just looking of course.
Doubt it'll be last.
This wasn't a YouTube video this was a full on MOVIE!!! amazing editing 👏 congratulations by the way 🥳🎉
This is my 5th time watching this and I dont know why I just keep getting chills in a good way
Love the video !!!!
Was this truck in lake Charles ?
The last i don't tinso i have frend he buy one 3 day ago in denver co yhe have like 4 the same
This is truly Inspirational!🙏🏻
Can we please see Gavin at cash days
Favorite video i’ve ever watched from this channel. Looking forward to the next one.
Man i watch lots of other Youtubers but I swear yalls content is next level love being here im glad i found yall racing the old man in a hellcat!!
I started watching Gavin around the first race with the old man. With me and my  business which I can be proud to say I’m self employed full time and will never look back have hope has become my daily saying with don’t lose sight in mind. This kid has grown something tremendously special, I’m glad to be along for the ride bud
Yall just get better and better with these movie style edits. Keep up the amazing content. It honestly motivates me to go after what I want. "Dont lose sight"
Is it just me... Or do the Wheels Look Like KIA Wheels?
I’m excited
Watch him give this away
The amount of inspiration this video put out is insane. From the grab opportunity by the horns, sometimes you have to be the one to knock, I never made a dime until I started doing what I wanted. Just insane. Also parts have been arriving LEFT and RIGHT. set of twins maybe? Awesome video.
They did not go off and buy my dream truck bruh, fml. She a beauty fr tho ;(
So twin turbo build 🧐
Can we just shout out Shelby for being tuned into the culture... Deff should have took the fan that showed u the listing but hey what do i know lmao
That's kinda crazy i saw one here in GA and was shocked then a few days later a video of you getting one
Im not a truck guy, but GOD DAM, who wouldn't love the lines on that truck. It looks mean, This is going to be a KILLER project for sure !!!
Next give a way
Not to be rude but Shelby is the only good thing Ford has ever really produced just saying every other vehicles seem to nickel and dime you until they’re done
Andrew killed it in this one with the editing and cinematography. Congratulations on the new truck!
This is the content I’m here for!!!
This is by far the BEST homage to Carroll and the Shelby legacy.
Bro this whole video made me 🥜
I am EXCITED!!!!!!! about this build!!!!
Bro u guys are just amazing.. unbelievable wut it's just a 6 crew has accomplished..for you guys iam stoked for this channel been around since the good ol days
This video is fake asf because the guy that owns a mechanic shop next to our school just bought a new Shelby truck that’s how I know this video is fake asf
Never clicked on a vid so fast
I wish you would have just done a regular bud style
Huge fan of the channel.  My name suggestion for this beast would be Frostbite!
Huge fan of the channel.  My name suggestion for this beast would be Frostbite!
👍🏻👍🏻
We’re you in Gilliam la at platinum raceway????
What a high quality, great video
Borderline professional cinematography, well done.
Where did doug learn to tune??
So where's Satin again? It ain't pushing fowarding, it's sitting deteriorating because someone won't put in the effort to making it as great as it once was. It started your channel so why don't you give it some appreciation?
100 grand for that truck s*** it better come with a Shelby GT500 motor swap
Race truck 2.0
Yeeeeeeeeeeesssss siiiiiiiiiiiiiir let’s fucking gooo
The quality of this is top notch
Can't wait to see the series on this truck
Yall think he drained the Castrol out after the shot or what?
That was an amazing video ❤
Thank you for always delivering the best and most 🔥🔥 content. No 🧢
Looks like they found the next give away vehicle lol
Yooooo, I saw one near my house. It was all black and I thought it was just a modded F-150 but then I saw SHELBY
Not only did he get to pick up one of the baddest looking trucks, he even got the full Shelby experience too and was greeted with open arms. Now that’s next level experience right there
Bro this intro gives me chills. Love Shelby man.
Five dollars that’s the new give away
So when’s the itsjusta6 movie coming out this was an amazing preview
Saw one of these the other day on the highway
Have you ever thought of another super rare vehicle to have on the channel? Why not a 2020 Yenko Camaro next you have years to get one! I love that Shelby and I freaked out when I saw you post about it!!
The video quality is insane
Subscribed!!
I have been fascinated and in love with the A/c cobra and GT40 for as long as I can remember and I have never stopped wanting one, or any shelby product for that matter. The fact that you have a Shelby F150 Super Snake and are doing a build on it is amazing and I cannot wait! I loved what youve done but damn i cant wait for this build.
Straight up professional intro to Carroll Shelby, great job.
Amazing video and on a awesome gentleman too. And its a damn nice truck too
Damn “vmp is typing....”
Too funny. The crew that can't keep a Ford running more than a week, gets this opportunity. This will be a dumpster fire! LMAO!
Love the editing.we are a new channel thats just started off, and we are hoping to get to your level soon
Bro this was like a movie 😂 btw keep up the good work
Bro this was like a movie 😂 btw keep up the good work
Production is insane
CRAZYYYY
At the end of the day ITS JUST A FORD TRUCK LMFAO
You have upped the editing game also.  Some great sequences
I thought I was watching Narcos for a minute
Number 45 on trending lmao
Amazing video was like a movie and I can’t wait for this build that truck is not just a truck it’s a work of art
yo some 3 piece wheels would look sick on the truck
I'm unsubscribing if he gives this one away.
I fucking knew he was getting this truck
Thank you for doing something like this we need to pass the history down to the Younger ages we can’t let a great man like this die out
Great video 📸 I cant help but notice how well it was put together. Good job!
The movie Ford V. Ferrari !!!!
The editing was a bit much but sick truck
Venom would be a good name or Frost Bite
I felt like I was watching a movie🍿
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas🤣
This is the best one yet. Awesome job
I would have thought that all of these were supercharged.
Its funny that even when I'm  working 110 hours a week i still find time to watch itsjusya6. Been  Watching since You bought Alison the duramax!!  And this video could be the start of something big!!!True fan ✌
Damn son this is network quality
Shelby would never ever do a truck he made muscle cars he was one-of-a-kind
That intro was amazing, I'd be lieing if I said I didn't cry a little bit.
This was a dope ass video! And that truck is gorgeous
Yo this video was fire.
Pro charger?
This is a dream vehicle of mine next to a 2004 svt cobra...
I’m genuinely excited to watch this
This is why I own a ford
I think you should install bigger exterior door handles. The factory ones are so small and sporty, they need to be beefed up asap.
Bro top notch video. One of the best put together videos I’ve seen in awhile. Also sick truck. Thing is dialed haha 🤙🏼
Swap that oil pan ASAP
Drift build?
I’m calling it now he’s going to blow up the motor or break something 🥴
You should’ve drove thru lake havasu city it’s a really beautiful place but small ish
I had chills the whole time
The nitrous truck feels betrayed
Just another give away😂
$100k for an N\A coyote F150 with some Shelby stickers. Am I missing something here? I'm more into cleaner trucks. No emblems, no badges, lowered.
Just think everyone, we could be witnessing the new carol shelby right now
Gavin and the team putting the respect to Carroll Shelby shows there love for motor vehicles
This truck is 10/10 getting twin turbos. Hopefully it’s the next giveaway vehicle 👀
@itsjusta6 What technician signed the truck?
Seeing another young person from small town Louisiana thrive like this makes me happy. Truly an inspiration
One of your best edited videos🔥
i give it 4 days and it will be supercharged
You should name this truck 'Lillith"
I just so happen to know someone who owns one of these it's orange and has a hand painted mural but it was built by ls customs think it's like 1 in350 or something
This video was fucking sick
ahh a history lesson from Mr.Simon
Sick ride
Bro I seen those sexy beast over in Mansfield TX there so clean
Top notch video right here. Well done gents
No bullshit this was one of best editing car videos on any channel on YouTube
Shelby truck vs Shelby gt350.
The quality of this content is better than 90% of the crap on cable television these days. Absolutely killing it. This is why Gavin is at the top of the YouTube game.
Amazing short film! Yall got skills. Congrats on the amazing truck and can't wait to see the future of it.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Killer video and the montages were great
Looks like a dodge tbh
What a sexy video. What a sexy truck. Can’t wait to see the build on this one boys
As someone who builds Shelbys for a living this video was really inspiring seeing just how happy customers are with them.
This is so awesome! Love it man. That thing is so sick🔥🔥
You guys should do more videos like this quality I know how much more work it takes but if there was a way to do tbis while also continue to post normal videos, honestly just upload normal with low editing just when ever you work on a vehicle than work on these as well
Considering it’s an f-150 I wish they made 150 of them like the Porsche 918 they made 918. But than again I wouldn’t be able to see this amazing build that’s about to go down so it’s better off this way
PLEASE DONT SELL OR GIVEAWAY THIS CAR
This feels like a ford add
We didn't even get to hear the truck running
Sweet man, can’t wait to see what you do with this one!
FUCK YEEEEESSSSSSSSSS
Best intro possibly ever👌
Obviously twin turbo build lol 😂 haha
Your channel is badass. The level of editing, planning and production is at the top. I haven’t came across any other YouTube channel auto related that even comes close. Keep it up!
The Super Snake and ACWs Lighting together 🌩

Gavin, it was a pleasure doing business with you. The video is amazing and definitely looking forward for more! I’m glad I was there to take the call that day. Wish I could have gone down to meet you. Big shout out to itsjusta6 and Gavin Simon! Welcome to the Shelby and Bill Pierre Ford family! Keep up the good work. Thank you guys! - Angel with Bill Pierre Ford in Seattle. Americas #1 Shelby dealer!
Super excited for you!  Can't wait to see what you have planned!

I made the road trip from Houston there, thata my profile picture, my Truck with Texas plates in front of the Vegas sign. Man that's awesome! Peep those Amarillo wind farms
Gymkhana build I’m calling it

Best video I’ve seen of y’all’s good job I loved it
Love it bro, i am watching You sincer the corvete racing and the old Man with the charger and You have evolved a lot since then 👌👌👌✌️
"we are going to turn this into a badass 4x4 truck" *Ram TRX* am i a joke to you? love the channel this truck looks sick cant wait to see what yall do with it
I love this video format and Shelby’s was the only Ford I liked I’ve always Been A GM guy though R.I.P  Shelby, Awesome editing btw
I work at a casino someone brought one of these Shelly's in to be valet and the valet got caught doing burnouts in the parking garage lol. Don't valet nice cars
Hands down the best YouTube video I’ve watched. Can’t wait for this build!
Bro one of these drove past me and I didn’t notice but the beastly noise made me check my mirror and it was one of these
Not to discount any of your other vids, but this series is going to be bonkers...cannot wait!
All I got to say is I love the channel and love what y’all guys got going on and I don’t care who you are or what you think these dudes know how to video.
Been here since 75k Man U inspire me a lot to not give up 💯💯
I am begging u to plz keep the truck plz plz plz dont give it away
Damn those shots in vegas man wtf...looks like a movie trailer. The rest of the video looks SOOO Much less shaky and more well focused too than normal
He’s lying to us guys I’m telling you the oil change was edited there’s no way he pulled a yellow drain plug that calmly and cleanly
One of the best videos ive seen!!
Imma say you're going to twin charge it.
This man paid mad respect to the legend. This is why I chose to purchase a Shelby over the competition, its just so damn iconic with deep automotive racing roots.
It’s incredible seeing the changes that have come to your Chanel over the years. I love the raw, uncut street videos you did in the beginning. But it’s clear to see how far you and your crew have come. Absolutely love it bro. Best 12 minutes of my day right there.
so happy to see how far you’ve came. back from apartment and parking lot mustang videos 😂
So what you mean to say is it will be broken in a week
About time been saying to get a f150
I am glad you bought the truck. Remember to send out a huge thanks to the guy who found this truck for you. I am a Mopar guy but I follow you for your love in Fords. Your content is good and I follow you all because I cn relate to your channel
Shelby F1050
Dude the production quality on this video is top notch

Big single turbo!
I had been following ur channel  years back when u race that old man hell cat and i had even made it to 3 of ur meets Here in dallas  and man the video quality is now even better than some professional movies that i had seen recently
I love ur vids I just wish they were longer. Ur such a great youtuber! Love ur cars and I've been here since the black car made 500 whp on the dino and the cops were called because it was so loud. Btw I cant wait for more black car and the shelby content.  (Ps. I cant remember the cars names, I have rlly bad memory loss)
Gavin please get the og mustang back on the track
$100k and it’s NOT already Supercharged?? Gorgeous lowered truck, with an all time great’s name on it, and a $100k price tag😅
$100k truck and you feed it castrol?! Blasphemy. Castrol is garbage. No wonder all your vehicles blow up
That was such a good intro
AYO NEW RACE TRUCK!!!!
Have Doug D review it.
Dude the quality of your videos never cease to amaze me. And yes Shelby was king of the road as well, he was a legend and one of the first pioneers to bring our passion to the forefront for other to enjoy as well.
the quality of these videos are insane
*Twin turbo’s inbound*
from now on you do the ford performance vehicle comercials
Man oh man I want that 2019 wide body super snake sitting next to my gt350
Need a collab with Post Malone... 1st truck and last truck, that would be cool. Then a music collab
😂😂https://youtu.be/3c3PPmlFKK8
I’ve never left a video so fast boring we like burnouts n racing
I can’t help but say... what the fuck was that at the end? It was so cringe 😬 you sounded like a cheesy actor or something... anyways sweet truck
Im calling it now its gonna be a twin turbo or whipple build
Just don't mess her up like the gt350
Yo you guys need to do the Chevy race truck vs this that would be AWESOME!!!!!!
Editing clinic!
You’ve made it Gavin, you’re at the top
Bro I’m aboard for this can’t wait dope cinematic amazing content🤟🏼🔥
I remember when when you started with just a GoPro and a Camaro and now your making a short movie it crazy keep up the grind
Man I Love Intro 2 This 💪💯😁🔥
Call it Shelby it’s literally written on the truck
10:07 yea… I really can’t keep anything stick 😂😂
Man I can’t believe this I made a comment a few videos back suggesting you guys do a similar build like this I’ve always been a huge lightining fan and this is nearly as close as you can get super excited to see this content what a beautiful machine
Looking for an Aldo Welds / Midnight Performance collab (Twin Turbo or bust!) or I am disappoint.
I hate fords , but omg that truck is amazing
If you ain't seen the movie ford v Ferrari yet take some time out of your day and watch it any true car person will shed a tear at the end
There's a point at 7,000 RPM where everything fades. The machine becomes weightless. It just disappears. All that's left, a body moving through space and time. 7,000 RPM, that's where you meet it. You feel it coming. It creeps up near you, and it asks you a question. The only question that really matters. Who are you?” Definitely my favourite Carroll shelby quote thank you Gavin and everyone else at it'sjusta6 for telling the story of a true God
Can already tell... this truck is gona be one badass mofo!!
Do you all think it's a giveaway maybe
Is it weird I REALLY want a Ford now?
All that engineering and still have the huge antenna
I’m trying to get to 1K anything can help! 😊❤️✨have a good day
Although I’m a gm fan I love trucks like this that truck is amazing!!!!
The production of this video is off the charts! You guys should be making movies not YouTube videos!
Me during the intro: who’s cutting unions🥲
This channel is so badass man editing is always great content always tops the last some how super hyped for this
I WANT TO DRIVE THAT TRUCK!!
yo this song was used on hartnett media’s vids
Watch him “give it away”
Gavin, you and the 6 Media crew outdid yourselves on this video. This was BY FAR the best video to date on your channel. I’ve been a loyal fan and subscriber for about 2 years now and seeing where all of you and your channel has come from is amazing! Keep up the great work and best wishes to all of you. Hands down best channel on YouTube!! 🤘🏻
Really crazy to watch this after I just watched the Ford VS Ferrari movie!!
This man makes it hit different sheeeesh I’m crying over here
I’ve seen one before in Orlando and they look absolutely wicked in person. Nothing like them on the road it’s ridiculous.
Best editing I've ever seen on any video on you tube.. Give that man a raise
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔻
Twin turbo supercharged super snake maybe? And yes you can twin turbo and supercharge an engine.
Gavin I stg the more I stick around the more proud I am of how fast you are growing and succeeding in life, I wish I could be in your shoes or even have a glimpse at all the stuff your doing, congrats
This intro is just 👌
As I said on insta, I smell a race truck giveaway lol
I'd just like to say I'm proud of you Gavin you are an inspiration for so many. Not only the young but the older as well. At 46 I feel like giving up sometimes. If not for my wife and kids and your videos it would be over for me. As a man fighting depression and anxiety with no meds. I don't like the way they make me feel. You and your team keep me grounded as my kids do. Keep on going bro. God bless you and your team and family.
Full Body Chills.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
So not cool to leave us with that cliffhanger. But ill be definitely waiting on the next video

So freaking hyped for this build, we all know you’ll make Shelby proud!
Rip to the race truck
I don’t understand how people can dislike this video this video is the first of a legendary truck
Hell yeah. And the chapters keep being written. This book/It's Just A 6's life, is such a blockbuster, and all of our dreams coming true. Just in YouTube format. Lol. Like I said from the beginning of me following your channel, and lives, keep pushing for those achievements, and you're still rising to a level like noone else has seen.(I'm sure others are doing the same thing, and climbing those ladders to their dreams in the clouds, no hating here) We're all proud of you, and the whole Just A 6 crew. So excited to see what's in store for that beautiful machine. Just hoping I'll be around to see the finished work of art y'all are going to grace us, and the world with. I'm not losing sight of the goals I have left to achieve, and I'm fighting this MS 24/7, to be able to ungracefully jump the life hurdles to achieve my goals of meeting you and a couple other YouTubers that have helped me through internal battles, and to be reminded to... NOT LOSE SIGHT.
Congrats 👏👏👏👏 keep up the good work
Hopefully u don't blow it up SMH lmao, No hate love the vids
Great video!!
By far hands down the most well made video ever to be on this channel! 10/10 boys congrats!
This was a great ass video 🤙🏼
Sometimes I watch your videos and actually cry because of how inspiring they are and how much I need to hear the things you said this was a absolutely amazing video I can’t wait to see where this truck goes
Love all the videos man keep up the grind only way from here is up man !
If you’re 19 years old or around that age. Remember that there is one point in your life, that you really get to chase your dreams, and that time is now. Just out of high school, ready to start your journey, make sure you don’t get trapped living out someone else’s dream. The world is yours never forget that
I swear if this is the next give away car.
Next give away car
I love your videos I have been watching since the old man gets down in the hellcat with u in the cammaro that is gone :(
Grew up driving American vehicles and loved my f150 that I bought from my dad before the military. Beautiful truck

This production is history
Hey Gavin I saw in your intro speed Vegas and the Las Vegas sign I live down in Old Henderson if you're still down here bud do you think you can swing by I've always wanted to meet you
Dad?
This thing is wicked street truck
So basically, you took the movie "Need for Speed" and kinda turned it into your life (Atleast the first part of the movie, and without being super cheesy about it)
Can't wait to see what's coming for the truck!!🤯🤯 I really enjoy your content and your videos keep getting better and better. This looked like a opening spot for the next Motortrend series. Keep up what you're doing and stay humble.
This is movie quality!! So impressive!
I would guess they are going to put the vmp blower from the black car on it.
What about the 80s dodge shelbys that he helped create?
Production quality was INSANE what a dope video.
I’m so fucking ready for this
He is the only reason i love ford the gt350r and now the shelby raptor💯
Please upload a road trip video if you have the footage for it🥺
The quality of this video is crazy good fellas! You should definitely think about doing more videos like this from time to time!
Holy shit, I remember when the channel only had the camaro, and y’all didn’t have a shop, crazy to see how far the channel has come
cant wait to see some turbos strapped to it!
It’sjusta6 confirmed takuache
Bet this is the next giveaway
Every video I'd like a movie. I have a 13 gt500, same color scheme, would be a quite a scene to have them together
Gavin, I hope to meet you one day. The drive you have to help people and better yourself is amazing! You are one of my fav youtubers. Keep up the amazing work and don't change.
Wow such a great video!
Bro that truck is just insane. Wow i am jealous but in a good way
Let’s stick to these type of cars not super cars .....
I really want to see the touring the museum footage and road trip footage
Don’t give this away finally a real race truck !
I thought I was watching a shelby documentary until I heard "Lets introduce the newest member of the channel"
This truck is so refreshing to see after the huge disappointment that is the 2021 lightning.
I honestly thought i was watching a trailer for a movie 🍿 !! 💯
Normies will say     ITs JusT A CaR
You could have built a truck just as fast or faster instead of buying that truck:(
Giveaway truck?
Anyone else gets chills at the Vegas sign

By far the best video ever released on YouTube
Why isn’t it Super charged it’s a Shelby super snake 🐍 100k for a Shelby truck end not supercharger 🤔😬
It may just be cold in my room but I think that this video gave me chills
Song at  4:13?

Oh good. I've always wanted to watch 17 blown motors come out of a F150.
The xxx version may or may not be on the way! 👍💗🍻
I saw a blue f150 Roush here in Atlanta in a parking garage at a hospital. I think a Dr drives it
Best video so far and this will be the best build ever in the history of anything your amazing and I love you and you Chanel and what you do for everyone
Congrats guys! By far the best video I've seen, probably on not only this channel. But YouTube as a whole. Can't wait to see more!

Bro you and your team are the goats! Keep it up
No quema cuhhh😭 I’ve waited so long to say that😂😂🔥
My dad actually purchased the new Harley Davidson edition I’ve been A Chevy guy forever but Ford has by far blown all the competition away with styling inside and out their new trucks are fucking beautiful.
im 4 seconds in...and its already badass!!!
This was a damn good video way to go.
Anyone else noticed Gavin said “followed by the gt350 in 2011”
Next Give away?? 🤔👀
Born in the 60s and growing up watching the Shelby legacy was one of the best memories of my childhood.  Having friends who were car enthusiasts and builders, everyone wanted a Shelby.  I grew up with the same dreams and desires you have, but never had the chance to follow them.  I watch all your videos and think about the times me and my buddies hung out just shining chrome on the engines or replacing a carburetor back in the day.  Congratulations on the new purchase, that looks like one bad truck.  Can't wait to see what you do with it!
Twin Turbo
Thought:  put it in Rocky Mountain Race Week and let us all share in the insanity and exhilarating fun of the week❣️
I bet you it's going to be the next giveaway after the FRS
0:49 Adam LZ?? 😂
Best video quality to date. Twin turbos coming for the Shelby?
This gave damn chills. Can't wait for what is going to happen 🤯
This looks amazing holy shit
Dont you dare giveaway this truck
Yoo rhis editing tho
Dope ass video
HOLY SHIT HE BOUGHT A SHEBLY F-150!!  (Edit: that vid was sick Gavin and the editing guys; great job!
You and boosted  should do a collab  truck vs truck
I feel like I should have bought a ticket to watch this. Damn, boys.
Im more of a gm typa guy.. but damn that thing looks sick
How come it’s a shelby but not supercharged
YO GAVIN that is so awesome man , to actually talk and meet with Shelby América.  You have a great channel and content keep up the grind og
Hell yeah brother. Congratulations. Working hard pays off. Keep on grinding.
You better not be giving this away...
So since it’s not supercharged, is it a 1:1 custom built turbo super snake? 👀
TwIn TuRbOs
But reveal videos hands down 😍 🔥
That truck is straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 can't wait to see what you have planned!!!! Congratulations!!!!!
This video gave me chillls! Soo pumped for this build!!
you have  reached new levels of cringe
Shelby is truly a legend
1400 horse power truck brotherrrrrr
Just wanna say this video was awesome you and your crew have done an excellent job and if I know you guys Gavin will definitely not keep it stock, so Doug definitely has job security and I along with the other viewers and subs will never lose sight thank you itsjusta6 crew you guys are killing it keep up the awesome job.
This was a documentary level video
Most Beautiful into by far
I needed to check if I wasn’t on Netflix lmfao this seriously looks like a movie keep up to good work gavin 🙏🏻
Shiiiiiiiit, this was a mini movie 🎥 by Itsjusta6 media production 👏. Now...YEEEEEEEEES Can't wait to see this build. Now what's going on with my ZL1 1LE? 1🤔😆
Inspirational
TRX !  Translation B E A S T !
Didn’t know this was a history channel
This will be one hell of a build
Loving the cinematography. Congrats!
Not going to lie.  You've got one of the best cinematographers and videographers that currently exists.
Mid reveal of the truck ... Inturupted by diapers... hugs in fact.  What a buzz kill
YESSS! I’m excited for what y’all do. Proud of y’all, moving on up!
The only thing I dislike about Shelby American is those trucks are over 100k and they put hydrodip carbon fiber. Only thing that really bothers me. Otherwise it's beautiful.
THE BEST YouTube car page hands down. Wholesome/unique content left & right that makes me not miss a video, keep up the amazing work G.
Shelby is rolling over in his grave right now with that electric rebadged Ford Explorer that Ford calls Mach E. That is not a Mustang. I am not a Ford fan but American muscle IS NOT ELECTRIC!!! This is one of the times American make car enthusiasts needs to come together.
What are your thoughts on the New Ford lighting coming out?🤔
Great video and the truck is awesome always wanted one
This video truly is one of a kind, congrats to all for all the work !!!!
Are you ever going to drag race again with the Black car? Its been what 3 years now since not drag racing?
Hands down one of the best pieces of content I’ve ever seen. Great job 6 media, you guys killed it. Amazing!
Damn, I got whole goosebumps watching this, the video was insane.. Production has moved onto another level.
No Supercharger???
Painted door handles please!!!
Awesome Gavin congrats I’ve watched you since the beginning this channel has come so far and is now more like watching a Hollywood production you and your crew deserve everything that comes your way!!!

Seen the Morimoto xb’s put on the other vehicles. And the f150 heads are even better. This truck deserves the quad low beams and Bugatti start up sequence, I’d say please get them but i already know they will be put on!
6:20 Can't trust no redline cold starting yahoos to transport anything
Best “new car” reveal I’ve ever watched. Sheesh

Please don’t tell me it’s gonna be a give away car
This video is very inspiring!!
Ohhhhh 😮 that’s it!!! That’s the truck 🛻 you needed! Huhhhh that’s so sexy 😍 🤤
I remember the 07 Shelby so much because my dad was lucky enough to be able to buy one. I remember having it parked in the garage next to his trans am. I remember going for drives with him the the 07.
This video went crazy, but the super snake reminds me of a old lightning. Super Sick
Wow........just..........WOW
i needed this
Bro I feel like I’m watching a fucking movie
That's a beautiful truck, awesome work guys on the truck and can't wait to see what you do with it.Great video 👍
Still watching the video but damn I feel like I’m watching a movie I got goosebumps just watching it’s incredible how far our channels as gotten I’m very proud of you guys don’t lose sight because I know they have more to come
Holy shit I seen one of these like a year ago, I got it on a vid on snap , and it looked so badass and I knew it was rare as fuck but I never knew it was that rare.   This was in Tucson Az if anyone cares    Congrats Gavin! Keep grinding playa
Literally livin my dream by getting that truck. Can’t wait till I have a garage full of different Shelby’s
I found myself rewatching this video, in closer detail. Amazed at the amount of passion in the editing, producing, and narrating. This is an absolute masterpiece of a video. Glad to have people like you, here on YT.  Thanks! @itsjusta6
Maybe a huge pro charger! They are killing it right now! Huge Power! 👊🏻
This was a whole ass movie (just amazing)
For the love of burning rubber, dont give it away....
ONG! This is a Great Video! This is going to RIP! I think you should keep it stock and in the garage for the next 40 years lol! The Truck is a Stunner!
damn whos cutting onions
You already messed up. You only use motor craft oil with Ford. It’s in the manual and even under the hood.
Love the video and all but the music in this video is 🔥🔥
I worked for the Bill Pierre dealerships in Seattle many years ago,  and I can tell you with complete assurance that the reason they didn’t retail the truck is because of an absolute insane amount of second sticker markup. On the plus side, now we get to see some awesome content here.
U for got the about the turbo dodges Shelby did in the 80's and early 90's
To be honest the speech gave me the chills and I loved it and it influenced me to go harder
Wtf is this a netflix series!? Lol loving this style of videography
Dope ass intro dope ass video
Please don't give this away
Any body else think of this as a very entertaining movie
Twins?
the intro was so sick showing what shelby did thru out his life
Compound super charger and turbo charger XD
I really like your channel but i dislike ford 🤷‍♂️

This whole video gave me chills 💯💯🤙🏾 To know where you can’t from 💯💯
Ngl corny video but nice truck can’t wait to see what you’re going to do to it
This video is Netflix level
Man! I’m not gonna lie, I’ve been here since day one, and all you do is best every video every time, I love how you show your passion towards the main goal of projects, and the best part is when you actually let us view it and be part of it. Keep up the good work and don’t stop I know things will even get greater yet!
This is that type of car that will be found in 10,20,30? Years time in a small garage and will be so valuable

Best produced video to date. Keep rocking itsjusta6!
Hey my names peyton Vaughn I don’t know if Gavin will ever see this but I’m gonna do my best for him too. So I didn’t get the opportunity to win your 2010 camaro and couldn’t get over the fact I couldn’t get it so I decided to sell my duramax and buy a white 2010 ss camaro manual of my own. I’ve never really owned a car like this that I’ve needed to do mods too so I was wondering if there was any way you could give me any guidance on doing something like this. I appreciate you so much and your crew and you’ve been my motivation for everything and you guys are such amazing people. If there is any chance I can get the opportunity to be able to talk you and tell you my story and ask questions I’d appreciate it so much.
I wanna see this baby on the drag strip or street idc, leaving a hellcat in the dust
My dreams have came true!!!! He finally bought an f150. That’s my dream truck(not the Shelby) but the single cab XLT 5.0 4x4
This is gonna be such a dope build I can’t wait to see it all come together and to see what they do to this already awesome truck
Congrats on a milli gav
this video was a banger
I know Gavin too well to believe this truck is N/A
All im gonna say is, its the same color as lucifer😶😶😶

Another amazing box office quality movie of a video yall produced. One word. Incredible.
Damn Gavin. Your channel went from juat some guy making videos of his builds and wrapping a bike in your apartment to making videos that look like a whole ass episode to a show. You've come a long way dude. Keep it up
Holy shit this was amazing I feel like y’all are actually a full production team like Discovery or something. This video is truly amazing
It is this man's career and life, for why I so deeply will forever love Ford....
We know your gonna make it go faster 🤗
Bro Utah is sick that’s why you where on your snap sayin you wish you could stay here
I was just in Vegas and I think I stayed at the same hotel... if Gavin was there at the same time as me, I’m gonna be a little upset that I didn’t get to meet him
Gavin you’re an a**hole 🤣🤣 but definitely can’t wait to see what you and the team have us waiting and craving more of each video can’t wait!!!
If you use anything but Shelby Authorized Parts..... you should be taken behind the barn and wooped !
WOW!!!!!! Just wow!! 👏👏👏👏 setting youtube standards!!!!!

This makes me wanna time travel into the future to see what y'all have up your sleeves
I’ve been watching this channel since he was in the tiny old apartment just after getting the Camaro. The amount this man has grown as a content creator and a person in unreal. These videos are becoming more and more like a documentary or movie than a YouTube video and it’s crazy to think about how much work goes into each one. And running all this with a group of friends to help you, that’s everything in life. Not to mention his music, I love it. This man is living the dream of many.
I just know it’s getting twins 👀
the channel continues to grow !! hell yeah more cars more cars lol
Glad you're american enough to buy ford and not some ricer friend..shelby legend
Sick ass truck

I really really hope he doesn’t give this truck away.
I saw this truck for sale and text my dad joking with him saying I wanted it 770 horsepower 0-60 in 3.3 seconds thing is a beast
Hmm so the name for this truck should be Kronos the super snake

I saw one but in gun metal gray getting Shipped to somewhere and they are really good looking
Damn you’re tan af homie
When I worked at my local Ford dealer I saw a f350 come in and I thought they riced it out with Shelby badges because I never knew they made Shelby f350. Turns out it was a fella who owned a 05 Ford gt and had just bought a 2019 Ford gt

So was the super snake the only shelby f150 made with 250 examples or was there a lesser tier model available that was mass produced?
And it all started when that f-150 put the gap on everyone a few months back😂

Badass truck  we all know what you're going to do   just like every vehicle you have. You do mods to the truck . Company sponsors you with stuff  to show off how good their product are. And then you drive the truck for a little bit and then it stays parked and your garage. because that's all you do   because you're always looking for a handout for companies to give you parts.   That's why Holley performance dropped you  and that's why we don't see no content on the race truck  because you don't want to buy the parts yourself   and that's why you only do videos on companies that give you stuff     and I used to watch your videos all the time but now all your videos are just plain boring  same old stuff just different cars  and no real driving
non super charged , how is it a super snake
Boy after that whole ass intro you better not give that shit away
So sick badass gavin
These video intros keep getting better with every car this team is insane! Killed it!
This presentation reminds me back when I was in school doing research for a PowerPoint. 😂
Post Simon lol. Got the rap career and now a Super Snake.
Didnt see that coming
The cinematography on this video is insane, great job guys!
this video was like a movie. shout out to your production team
Wow you just bought my dream truck
Wow that was an amazing video
Did anyone else shit their pants with utter joy?
He’s gonna give it away I already know it
Y’all killin the game for real!
Itsjusta truck
I knew it was gonna be another shelby and man am I excited!!! Race truck vs the shelby?? 🤔
Your guys kill everything that you do I got chills on this intro
THE FUCKING EDITS AND LIKE CLIPS AND Cinemax we’re amazing bro gave me such a good feeling like nostalgia and it was crazy bro your doing great bro 👏👏👏
hmmm lookin like a new giveaway car
What a killer truck! Congratulations on your purchase 👏🏽
Man i remember meeting carroll shelby back in 2012, hella cool dude he ended up signing a jegs hat for me. But he was a really cool dude, he could talk for hours just about cars if you let him 😂😂
This was a movie
Bro the quality of this was like watching a movie! My favorite car channel for sure!
Hell yes man!!
I’ve been watching itsjusta6 for years now and I can firmly say this was easily one of my favorite car reveal videos he’s made great job itsjusta6 team you all killed this video
Nex video gonna be "NEXT GIVEAWAY CAR" lmao
This needs to be a movie!!!
Hurry up and show the turbos we wanna see
Like this way more than the stangs 🙄👀
Dudes gonna have the fastest Ford truck out there
Question... Is the company Hennessy kind of like what Shelby was back in the day?
THATS CRAZY STILL WONT BEAT MIDNIGHT PERFORMANCE F150 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Bad ass. Gavin, you are living the dream. It’s insane to see the life you have created having watched you from the early stages, I wasn’t a viewer when the camaro was the main car but I’ve been here since the day you picked up the race truck and I am absolutely stoked to see the growth. Great job man! Really great job!
this is what you needed on the channel
The production of this video is amazing 💯💯
This is what lightning should of been instead 🥴
Not even going to lie my car ain’t the fastest and I can’t do much but every time I’m smashing through gears or just cruising I have a smile on my face, I just cant imagine how Gavin is feeling
Amazing wish Ram brought back the SRT-10 and Chevy to bring back the SS and Ford to bring back the Lightning but to its true form with a supercharged V8 just like this Shelby F150 not no electric crap, I plan on buying a 2021 F150 in the future and plan on building it.
This man is living my dream
Please don’t make it a giveaway vehicle. There’s a high chance it could go to someone who’s just gonna sell it or not appreciate that and I don’t wanna see that for this legendary truck
This is a movie
Epic video can't freaking wait
LETSSS GOOOO
End up being giveaway car😢
This is insane
What a tease
Wow wow wow, incredible. Cannot wait to see what’s next! Very impressive.
Dude that freaking truck is sick. chevrolet sports cars are my favorite but ford trucks are bad ass that's why I own 2 Ford trucks. I can't wait for the build to start.
It would be cool to have a Shelby truck and a Saleen truck
Dang, Gavin you have come so far. I remember when I started watching when you were replacing the bumper on the Camaro, then the black car came along, then the April fool's joke that made me go outside at a dinner I was at to watch, and now all of this. Good job man
we got a white and blue stripe at my dealership 4 door
New Ford lighting?
you should never sell that truck
question is will the channel get sponsored by Shelby America
I was at work and i found oyt abouy this threw fb ughhh
Please don’t make this a giveaway, Ill say it again, DONT give it away 😩
So stoked to see you get a truck like this. Nobody on YouTube is doing one
Please don't give it away keep it for you Gavin
This video is pure motivation
When he doesn’t say it’s a not gonna be a giveaway👀🤯
It gonna be a twin turbo monster
Is it just me or you brightened the logo.
Gavin not gonna lie you were losing me but you pulled me back in
what a banger, felt like i watched a movie
Prolly gonna throw the race truck away now i lowkey wanted that truck to be done 😣😢
Now we talking fellas that's a truck congrats can't wait to see what will get done to it
I'm a mustang guy I've owned several different years and models so I fuck with this video heavy
I love shelby
Can’t wait to see this thing get twin turbos from garret and then watching it race against satan
Ford needs to come out with a Ken Miles edition....
I got to see one of the trucks when they very first were launched, it was on a transport truck heading south. I am/was in Tennessee when i seen it, never knew till now how rare it would be to see it , probably the last time i will ever get to see one
I love my 2018 F-150 5.0 been watching for awhile I plan on adding a gen 5 whipple and some other goodies hope so see more videos of you building this truck for some Ideas for me love the channel keep up the good work
I thought I was watching a documentary on Carrol Shelby for the first 3 minutes 🤣🤣
Mind blowing 🤯🤯🤯
Literally my favorite video y'all have made. Carroll Shelby is one of my heros.
People always ask why I like and buy Ford. No other company just has the story behind it like Ford does and C. Shelby made that happen.
This feels sponsored i don’t know why
Best video every and thank you for bringing his memory back
Please dont make this a giveaway. Make this one of the long term staples of the channel, like Satan. Ive been waiting so long for a notable YouTuber to get one of these.
Hell yes!!!!!!
Idk if there was only 250 of the single cab versions but there were 500 super snakes made, one of my friends just bought a greyish silver quad cab/crew cab super snake and it was number 330 something
Anyone else forget it was an itsjusta6 videos
Aahhh mahhh gawd 3 hours ago and already over 100k views,the video feels like a movie that pc gamers make abiut rust amd dayz lols
I mean yeah as the Mechanic. But one to relish in the escapees as you all have enjoyed.
So there’s a red super snake near me a new 2020 and it’s so beautiful seeing one in person.
By far one of the best intros to a video ever
This literally gave me the chills cant wait to see the build keep it up and don’t lose sight 😁
One ? Where was Doug!!!
Ik this man didn’t just Africa by toto when he talked about it
Twin turbo of course
100 thousand dollar truck with halogens...Ford
That thing is so gorgeous
Yesssssssss Shelby’s are the only way to go
I know it’s rare cuz I’ve never seen one on the road before I’ve seen a few Lightning’s but not a Shelby I’ve even seen a 1969 rolls Royce around my town
Aight, this is absolutely mad. Having followed you guys for a long time, I think you guys just hit the ceiling and went right through. Good luck on your build, hope for a great future, congratulations, and lastly, this video is batter than cinematic: it's a tear jerker. Mazel Tov, boys. And to the truck, welcome to the family.
I like this
When itsjusta6 does cinematic vids it’s truly a work of art for the size of their team
This is badass Gavin, good for you bro
Production value is really great. Good job.
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS CHANNEL DOES NOT HAVE MILLIONS OF SUBSCRIBERS!! THIS CHANNEL IS EPIC!
If this is a giveaway car/truck I will literly cry #legendary
this better not be a giveaway 😑
Wtf most super snakes come with a Whipple what happened?
Brooo. Don’t Tell me he gonna give this one away
I seriously got chills watching the intro. You guys never let me down. Love this channel so much
absolutely can not wit to see what happens with this truck im betting supercharge bc gavin mentioned posty's supercharged super snake the thing better make 1500hp stg.
LETS GOOOO I thought it was gonna be the 2020 gt500 but I am just as happy with what you got I love the carol shelby story truly a icon and a man to look up to
Your tell me that truck is $100,000 and those are the headlights it comes with 🤯
This is hands down the greatest video I think I've ever seen on the channel.
Omg plz take it on the track just to see
Ol Shell. The chicken farmer.
I just got my first truck it’s a 1998 GMC Sierra I’ve never been so happy in my life
Don't forget to get a 2021 GT500

Shelby you will be missed Ford lovers God RIP
hands down one of the highest quality automotive videos on YouTube awesome job
No need to brag but I was right😎
We all love you Gavin
The best intro I’ve ever seen
So happy for you, keep on killing it 👏
That truck is a beast! Shelby knocked it out of the park when designing it. I am excited to see what you guys have in store for it.
Put a bodykit on it
This video come in 1 AM and I am watching it... Oh boi, Gavin what are u doing to me 🙉🙉🤣  Still love your videos and everything... Much support 🤍 dls
This is badass!!!! Can't wait to see how this shelby comes along! 😍
I love this history lesson man and congrats on the bad ass truck!!!
Imagine that truck in LeadFoot grey 🤔😯
So ready to see this build
Omg! Just OMG! NUFF SAID! WOW!!💪🏻🔥💯💯
The chevy truck is just like im a joke to you??🤨🤨
I really hope they don’t but do a give away with this truck
Paint match the headlights and taillights plus making them leds💦🔥
I feel like i just watched a movie
Worth the wait
It’s so beautiful to see how far you have came I remember seeing you with only about 30k subs and you have grown so much truly an inspiration keep up the work looking forward to the new videos
Couldn’t have done this any better. Very impressive
ItsJustA6 production value 📈📈📈📈📈
That intro thooo 😍😌
Can’t wait to watch videos six months from now titled “ Thousand horsepower super snake won’t run right and we don’t know why”
That was an awesome vid especially with history of Carrol Shelby can't wait for future content
:D
Best video.. that's a beauty!!
Hell yeah gavin nice truck looks beautiful, can't wait to see what you guys have in store for it. 😎❤️
Great editing!! Loved the video! Keep it up!
I can already hear the cuhhs
This video would have been bad ass before you ever talked about mr. Shelby. But the fact that you have such close details on him and what he did with his life, really just made this your best video yet! Congrats on the accomplishment man.
Loved the intro but you forgot the viper. And the daytona. He was one of the greats and will always be remembered. I'm lucky enough to live by the shelby america museum and go there at least 3 times a year. It's crazy to think how much one man changed the game.  I've watched this channel from when it started with the "cursed" Camaro and I gotta say. You've grown a lot and I'm happy to see it. From turbo 4's to high boost v8's. Keep goin brotha. Don't lose sight.  Be the change you wanna see in the world. Keep bringing the smiles and the laughs, also the boost. All the boost!!!!
Bro amazing video it seemed like I was watching a movie
Love to see a truck! But can we get a mopar on the channel soon? None of your Ford cars run right lol
I know you should leave it alone people going to say it’s a rare truck but on the other hand I want to see that truck even Stun the one that designed that
Funny thing is guys. I seen him in this truck Saturday @the drag strip. I seen him sitting in the back of it watching people drag race as captain was with him too. All of his friends and there cars too.
Calling it now, it's going to be a save the manual giveaway in the future
I like the look of it. But wish it was a long bed instead of a short bed
Sexiest truck ever minus the taillights they definitely bitched the taillights
Oh boy here we go again
give it away;)
Ngl this is the best and. I mean best delivery video ever
i would not be surprised at all if ford made parts of this video in to a commercial thats how good this video was
Who misses 2019 Gavin
I really hope to see this truck on the channel years from now love this truck so much love you guys content keep being great Gavin much love!
Bro, I watched all the ads to help you out! LOVE IT!!!
While bunch of montages
I liked this video
He’s definitely gonna pro charge that truck.
Dammmm it bro......🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’ve been waiting for this fucking moment 💯🤩
No quema cuhh
Broo 🔥🔥🔥 my fav one for sure. Love the shelby super snake!!
King of coyotes!
First off sik ass intro bro🔥 second, netflix needs to hire you as a narrator, and third bro im so freakin excited to see what the shelby has in store😍 maybe some woshy boys? Twins? Hmmmm thatd be interesting👀👀👀🤷🏽‍♀️
Quality video. Those trucks are ugly imo. Hope you do something about that lol.
the b roll and the editing for you're videos just keeps getting better and better top notch stuff
By far one of the best edits !!! Love your channel !!
This shits too professional
Dodge will always be better then ford
Low key think he’s going to  1 Super charge it 2 drag tires 3 Roll cage 4 track truck   The Shelby tt    Also air suspension 😂
PLEASE!!! Don’t give that one away!
Race the roushhhhhh!!!🤑🤑🤑🤑
Next give away
And it's the next give away
Please take the original motor out before you blow it up
He's just gonna modify this car until he is only able to drive it twice a year like the mustangs
yea ford lightning hold my beer
As I’ve “matured” in my car taste, I’ve realized how iconic Shelby is. Those shots of you guys driving down desert roads in a Shelby was nothing short of beautiful...
I have a whipple f150, I would highly recommend doing a raptor steering wheel swap in that thing! if you have any questions about it dm me on insta (2019_5.sl0w)
Ok I see you with the 5's
I am a huge Shelby fan, my dream and dedication will be to own before my day here ends. Everytime I see one in person I gaze into what is just more than a car. I shed a tear of happiness of seeing a Shelby. I’ve been honored to drive a 13-14 gt500 and I was speechless. I was crying tears of joy the entire day as well. This video itself also made me shed a tear of joy. Even if it’s a f150 the styling and performance is beyond magnificent. Shelbys are a form of art and more than just a car. You own a piece of history as soon as you are given the keys and get behind the wheel of a Shelby. This video will keep me working harder and harder and give me the motivation to lead me to my dream car 😭❤️💯🔥
Anyone else thought he got a 1967 Shelby gt500 ?lol
Saaaaweet! Congratulations Gavin and ofcourse the guys!!! Now to watch the movie.
Seriously guys... well done. It's always been a dream of me to have a shelby. The man was my hero. Thank you for honoring that american hero and doing it properly.
motor say bye bye
Can’t wait to see it on the drag track, I can’t wait to see the built and how much hp it’s going to make.
Fashow  💨🔥💪💯👀
Sick ass editing
Cant wait for the zl1 to get presents🙃. But good job “itsjusta6”
It's American then it sucks the end of the story get an old Nissan it smokes the American car end of the story that is life
Ngl I don’t really like the frs content but this Right here is something I can get behind
Watch the truck get twin turbos
New give away
Next giveaway
This will be a giveaway vehicle at some point

Wow bro did I just watch the best video from you💪🏻🔥🔥🔥
You better be putting a Whipple under the hood of that!
Twin turbskis coming in hot
Guess your not gonna keep it stock ?
New drag truck maybe
Gavin once again does it with the best content on YouTube
A guy here in town in Tallahassee FL has one as well it’s badass
Hey, you were in my neighborhood..
Adam LZ getting the compound, Jimmy Broadbent getting into BritCar, and now Gavin with all this. Y’all are making fucking moves and it’s awesome to see!
Shelby cars and trucks are absolutely insane vehicles
Gavin, and to all the people who help with this kind of stuff I thank you because these are the vids that got me started into the car world.
This car looks straight outta gta or forza
Not going to lie, Gavin is one heck of a narrator
Lucky guy!
One HELL of a narrative and editing from the 6 MEDIA TEAM!!!! Get after it guys
In the “Mexico streets” 😂
OUTSTANDING!!!
the intro reminds me of Discovery Channel
Ohhh so this is what his snap story was about
I’m guessing it’s getting a supercharger  ? Lol
I really love it when Gavin makes these videos, always super well scripted and put together.
One of the best purchase ever
DONT GIVE IT AWAY
Insane!! When that first pic of the truck dropped got mad goosebumps. So wild man can’t wait for this build
I’m not usually a fan of the give away on the real cool shit ( viper) but if you give this one away I will buy s bunch of money on merch
“There’s no such thing as too much horsepower, just not enough traction” -Carrol Shelby(probably)
Super 🐍 and semen demon ( Silverado) making a trip to Mexico in the future 👀
Awesome truck.
Like the channel and content, but this truck is just gross. It’s like fitting a fat lady in a bucket race seat with 5 point harness. Those halogen headlights... For 100k they don’t give you LED’s? Curious to see the build though.
God, the gt350 Vs the Shelby truck 🤯
im happy u got a ford drag not no chevy drag truck
I swear to fking god Gavin if you give this one away imma lose it
Damn ok Gavin I see you moving up in the world and doing so good 😊 wanna fix my car engine problems and put a Gavin’s touch on top?😂😂😂 joking keep up the good work
This is so sick
Nice now do something with the white Silverado
You guys production quality is second to none!
Editing and production is nuts 🥜
And not gonna lie that's a pretty cool truck normally I only like toyoda rams that's a sweet truck. Congratulations not to mention if you want a collectible Ford Shelby is the way to go
I want one soooo bad😩😩😩😩
Man I was getting sick and tired of that gt86 finally I can watch your content again
this man doesn't live the dream he builds it
Damn I was just in Vegas at the Shelby Cobra museum. R.I.P Shelby.
Man I’ll always have respect for Gavin growing this big and the whole team and even zorbii with minimal shoutouts or partners with other you tubers just a straight empire, thanks for everything and don’t lose sight currently building my dream “kid” truck 01 Sierra lq4 turbo 5 speed ss clone scsb
still has a plastic drain plug, why? why would they ever do that with a truck that cost that much let alone their cars.
SEND IT TO MIDNIGHT FOR TURBOS
So twin turbo super snake drag truck build.
Shelbys has always been my fav
cant wait to see what you guys bring to this trucks table, it’s a shelby truck so you better put it to its full potential, one of my dream vehicles is that truck right there
But how only 9.5k likes and 100k views. Wtf
Who wants to bet that the truck will end up as a give away
This is the next give away car I already know it
Me thinking it was gunna be a top fuel dragster..... lol
This is sick
You fucking killed it white this video 🔥🔥🔥💪
Wdym it’s not supercharged ??
He'll yeah bro 🎉🎉🎉😱❤️❤️
Whats funny is that the guy from legado 7 algo got a Shelby truck 😳😳
Twin turbos or single turbo I’m calling it
Always killing it with the cinematic videos 👌 always look forward to seeing them.
Damnit man!!! Aite nie Gavin we gone need some Shelby content everyday!! Awesome af congrats!! Cant wait to watch this build
You better enjoy it the new lightning sucks a fat one electric 4 door what the hell Ford . Shelby bad ass truck my friend.
Forgot this was a 6 video by 2 mins in
I hope he uses the truck after he finishes it this time 😐
I saw a truck being delivered at a local dealership back when the Shelby f150 came out and the owner was nice enough to show me around it, that was actually what got me into the automotive world
Lowkey seen a lifted one over here in Texas 😂😂 but they are beautiful 😍😍
This is fucking awesome.
Is this the Tuscany Super Snake with 757 HP?
Hi guys, I'm from Melbourne, Australia and I have been watching your channel for about a year or so now and love it. Carrol Shelby is one of the most iconic legends in the automotive industry around the world and most people in Australia know who he is, and it was awesome to see you guys do a tribute to him. R.I.P. the man, the legend Carrol Shelby.
now you think you a movie star lol basically say nothing about the truck , no tour of the factory , YOUR VIDEOS ARE BECOMING BOGUS , clout changed you . I bet in the next year or two youll quit youtube , well you basically have
Takuache
Best video y’all have ever made. The production on this video is insane.
Dude if this is going to be a give away car, bruh that will be so cool like honestly. One of the sickest truck to date, one of the best automotive YouTubers, and a dream to blow the world. That is a sick background. The stories you could tell if you won it...
CHILLS THE ENTIRE VIDEO! 😦
Please don’t give this one away🙏🏻
This would be a good tax right off!!
Gavin should talk about the history of cars more often. Loved the intro ❤️
knew it, I called it I called it I called it 😂
yall should do a stock race against captain and then do a repeat after the mods
Definitely reusing ur old coyote supercharger aren't you
istg if this is a giveaway truck...
Gavin please keep it
This has to be my favorite video on the channel and probably on the entirety of the YouTube platform.
I’m out on the Miata brz stuff but this hell yea congratulations
The speech about Carroll was amazing, honestly got me a little emotional
I think I’m in love , nothing better that that Shelby truck😍😍😍
That truck is BaDaZz
Can’t wait to watch this build
Years ago I was a TA to an engineering class that several of my friends signed for, one of my good friend told me he had an interview Ford next week and was worried that he might not get an offer. I remember telling my friend to push the vehicles to the limit: drift it, do burn outs, and don't worry about scaring the Ford interviewer. He flew to Arizona and came back with huge smile, and he said he did what I told him and scared the crap out the Ford person he was with. And explained to Ford that he loves cars, especially performance cars and is excited to push these cars to their limits. He said he was the only person that Ford offer a mechanical engineer position to on the spot.
I don’t know. Doing sketchy shit two states away with a back pack full of cash is just more interesting.
glad to see another truck on the channel!
Ayyye I didn’t know you were in Vegas!!! Well, Welcome to Las Vegas! I hope you enjoyed it!
Keep this forever they are for sure gonna go up in value
Bro bad ass video you look stocked
this truck is literally what dreams are made of.
This is perfect congrats on owning a rare piece of automotive history.
Forgot this was not a documentary 😂😂
Forza Horizon pleaseeee!!!???
This is going to be one Epic build I got my notifications on this one
This might have been my favorite intro/video all in one!!
geeeeeez dude. you got me cryin in the beginning
Please tell me your keeping this icon
Video quality A1 seeeesshhh🧢
This one is going to be a special build. Can’t wait.
Twin turbo kit incoming.
Love ForD🔥🔥💪🏻💪🏻
This video literally has set what I want to do with my life if I don’t work on cars and do some epic shit like you guys do I will go crazy 😂
Great video👍🤙
No disrespect intended but... maybe you should think about keeping it stock-ish so that it maybe works for more than 3-4 days and one pass?
I would say your best produced video yet! Looking forward to the rest of the Shelby content! Great job!
I see why grandpa had a Ford and I do too 👍🏾
Congrattt so proud here since the start 🥲🥲
Grew up turning wrenches on a 68 Shelby Gt350 Hertz Car...this will be iconic for the channel!
Giveaway truck?
Production on this episode is amazing!
Ok let me just start off my story of Shelby American. ( really not as exciting as itjusta6) but it was still cool. Anyways I completed my Eagle Scout. I had emailed dodge, Ford, and Shelby, for a tour of one other facility’s. Well Shelby was the only one to respond back and told me. Hello there we would be more than happy to take you on a tour of our facility. All expenses paid for and free tour. So we drove from Texas all the way to Las Vegas and stayed a week there so mid way through the trip we had our tour. I have to say that was one of the most amazing tours I have ever been on. First when we got there the tour guide asked who I was and then realized I was the Eagle Scout and told me . Here come with me and we will go take a ride In my personal Shelby. I was more thrilled. Beautiful car, signed by carrel Shelby him self on the dash and it was like 1: 2,000 or somthing like that. Anyways let’s just say I had got payed the day before and blew my whole pay check at Shelby🤭🤭 oooppps. Anyways I just wanted to share my story since I say that itsjusta6 went a little bit after I went. I went in December of 2020
It has the giveaway vibe to the video. Just saying
That was an awesome tribute you made to Carroll Shelby. Can't wait to see what you do with the truck
Came a long way from a broke ass R6. Congrats mate.
this is fucking amazing, this channel needs more recognition
Let’s gooo
My jaw, was dropped pretty much the whole video..
Okay, first off. I’m still upset that the channel hasn’t been poppin like it used to.  But…. I will say, you built a great team, I feel like family . Also, I love everything that you’re doing. Keep it up, and you’re going down as a legend. I hope someday I could either win something and drive down there, since I’m here in Lafayette.. but anyways, DONT LOSE SIGHT ‼️
It took way to long to realize who was narrating.
Six Season..... LETS GO
Someone tell me if I'm wrong  but is the part 1:32 at willow springs?
I know who has vin 001 and 002
I would immediately upgrade the headlights and black out the rear taillights. This is going to be a beast build
I was so sad to find out that ford will no longer be manufacturing gt 350s. Which means no more shelby gt 350s. It was.very said to me because I'm not even old enough to drive yet and the shelby gt 350 is my dream car. At least I will hopefully have a 2020 gt 350 or older some day.
this is the best thing you could have done after the zl1 👌🏼🔥
What a video man!
What’s the ending song?
Holy cow I can’t wait for the series to drop now and y’all did such an amazing job! Y’all have always been my favorite guys to watch and now y’all have literally just made my spark for my cars grow that much more.
I came
Yoooo I can not wait to see this build series. I just wanna say thank you for all the videos you’ve put out in the last few years. I’ve learned so much and had so many laughs from your videos. All your builds are incredible and stupid fast. Keep up the good work Gavin and the team. Can’t wait for more videos
How. The hell. Is this man the same age as me and I got giddy over a clapped out svt focus when he’s getting requests to call over the phone with Shelby America? Great find Gavin. I think I can speak for the rest of us in saying we’re excited to see what this truck brings.
Just watched a fuckin movie
I hope this is a giveaway truck because I am would be pumped. I’m looking forward to the videos as a big Shelby fan and a fan of the cars, builds, and videos on both channels have been awesome. I been waiting for something other than trx or raptors and this is just the perfect one
This is the sickest truck I’ve ever seen. I didn’t even know this existed, omg. I cannot wait to see what is in store for this. You’re the reason don’t lose sight is on my windshield , you keep motivating me to push harder in life.
Jesus man gotta leave us wondering 😂
The thing is they build all these cars but they don’t even take it out and really race them.
Damn 3 years later on this channel and it never gets old I love this channel

"Post Malones was supercharged", is Gavin going with twins on this build?
That truck looks so stupid ..... the Ford part of it
He said “except post Malone’s was supercharged” so does that mean his isn’t?
Chills literal chills
I got a 2021 Ford F150 ad before watching this vid
Best intro ever Gavin nothin but love brotha hope meet you one day one love one passion one last ride

I was in my garage when this notification came up, sat down next to my 2009 shelby gt500 to watch this. My car may not be the fastest thing out there but it sure does bring a smile to my face when the boost kicks in. Im proud to own a shelby 💪
Nice edit looks like a movie can’t wait to see what y’all do to it
Man shelby is such a iconic person and inspiration and you have done the same thing you have inspired a lot of us keep it up man

Bro you better not give it away in a giveaway
My boss's 11 or 12 Shelby gt500 is actually at Shelby America for 4 months now they are doing a 1 of 1 wide body kit and stage 2 kit on the car. Only other time they've done the wide body was for a replica/ test fit.
Tesla swapped shelby
Shelby F-150 beat the TRX
Can we get some “don’t lose sight” Shelby merch somehow?!?! I need this truck to go with my white/grabber blue Shelby
Congrats! I love those Shelby F-150's!
Not supercharged? I thought they all came with it
coming from a household that houses THREE 1000rwhp single cabs, one being a new f150... HELL MOTHER FUCKIN' YES
By far the best video and edit so far...keep up the good work
Who remembers when he had to do a touch less car wash in his mustang? Now he takes his brand new super snake into his detailing bay. Congratulations Gavin keep killing it.
I was on Snapchat and i randomly saw a pic of you with that truck and literally spat my drink out lol
Hey Gavin ik y’all have plans for the truck but truly if y’all want to make it 1 of 1 kind  twin turbo it like the gt50 that would be unique and different
That’s so sick! Great purchase
Off-road
Make a damn movie already
Yolooooo that’s the next give away
Oh god I have a feeling this gonna be the next give away car
It’s not a Ford, it’s a Shelby.
The production on every single video is fucking insane. Way better then any other automotive Channel keep up the good work on the videos man!!
I feel like it’s going to be twin turboed
I clicked so fast when I seen the thumb nail I can not wait to see what you with this truck and congrats on the purchase
i honestly hate you gavin for teasing us this much, I was going to curse you because of not posting anything about this, until I heard you were dropping more videos of this journey, then I got happy. And we also can't wait for this build to be done. btw you (and cleetus) are the main reason I watch youtube, I absolutely love cars and you guys are very entertaining, from car videos and you guys joking around and etc... i really love this channel and wish you good luck all the way from Dubai.
Trokiando cuh
I’m guessing twin turbo🤔
hold up hold up you bought a shelby truck i mean its awesome im not gonna lye but now you gotta start a colection of shelby mustangs

Wow looks great!
My dream truck 🤤🤤🤤
I already knew the history of shelby congratulations on a shelby owner (prick) I want one sooooo bad
Love the historical aspect to this video bro🤙🏽
This video went harder then WW2
Been watching for about a year and a half now I think and I don't think I've ever been this exited to see what awaits for a build
You should name in dominion. Idk just think it’s a cool name cause it means ruling or controlling power and that’s what the GT - 40’s did at Le Man 😂😂
Calling it now, he's gonna twin turbo it.
This model and the 5.4 lightning have been my all time favorite trucks
“No such thing as too much horsepower… Just not enough traction.”
God such a beautiful truck. Shelby is definitely one of the best brands. Love to see where your gonna take this truck 👀
I forgot about the Castell sponsor
“Race track” and it’s a damn drag strip lmao.
I literally had goose bumps the whole video
So you got another truck to build. What's going to happen to the chevy truck. I want to see it in more content.
Production quality goated
Please be a cobra 🤤  Edit: jaw has now dislocated from that drop, wow
I hope he squats it
Hype is real!
yeeeeeee yeeeeeeeeee
Gavin is in a way, a lot like Shelby. Nothing can stop him. He has faced & overcome some of the craziest obstacles. His drive & ability to capture feelings is why I love his content. Don’t lose sight, Gavin.6️⃣
Gavin is gonna need that All Motor Labs tune for sure
Next give away vehicle. Watch. If he does. I’m about to spend around 5K on merch to get this.
This has got to be the best intro I have ever seen!
Much respect. R.I.P Carroll Shelby..
RiP Shelby, light a Candle each year for one of the Greatest Car Gods to Drive this Earth. Ford v Ferrari is a Great Tribute movie to both Shelby and Ken Miles.  it should be the must watch for any car enthusiast
absolutely phenomenal production/editing  yesirrrrrr
100% new version of Ken Blocks F-150 would be sick!
Either big turbo or whipple supercharger
let’s gooo 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Y’all are carrying the automotive scene right now, been watching y’all since day 1 , keep killing it🤘
From the 350Z to this. Holy shit man, you really are in the big leagues!
My favorite addition to this channel... MR. SHELBY IS AN AMERICAN ICON AND IN MY OPINION THE OPITIMY OF "DON'T LOSE SIGHT".... thanks GAVIN...
My god man I live to see how far you and ur crew have come. Now let's make the coolest shelby in the world!!!!!
Dude. The quality on this fucking video is next level
The amount of work that goes into these videos and ideas is insane love this channel
isnt it just a f150 with a whipple lmaoooo
Ah shit
The best into I’ve ever seen 👏👏
Godddddd d***** !!! 🔥
Believe it or not the truck is actually made in Indiana by a different company. (Shelby outsources the trucks). Idk if this one was but almost all of them are
These edits are f*cking insane 🤯
Absolutely loved this video 🤝
A Turbo Shelby Super Truck, nice
New Race Truck? :) :) :)
Your crew did an awesome job on this video, I think the production quality is the best yet. You all keep stepping up your game. Mad respect for you and your crew.
First of the new giveaway vehicles once save the manuals is over. Just calling it now.
Now please dont give this one away
A super charger feeding two turbos is what I've been screaming with all-wheel drive you couldn't do much better than that.
Really???? The growth over the last two years is impressive gavin. Well done brother
Let's go... I need that in my life! Thank you for bringing it to us...
He better not give that truck away that is one truck that needs to stay with him and be in the bast hands possible
during the history part of this I got chills I watched the movie they did on this 1-2 years ago I think
Hell no
Watch this be the next giveaway🤦🏾‍♂️🙄 Or he bought this to replace the race truck
These intros and stuff are always like real movie scenes or documentaries clips, i also wasn’t expecting a truck lmao
Next giveaway lol
One of the best videos

Aldowelds turbo kit midnight performance 10r80 boom fast
dont be a dumb ass , actually let this one run , AND STAY RUNNING
Damn 100k for non supercharged shelby is a little high...the few that they had locally were 100k but had a whipple on it
i swear i thought i was watching a movie.
A set of twins🤔🤔🤔need that
Congrats once again Gavin! That Carroll Shelby quote at the end fits you like a glove. Man, when you took delivery of that Super Snake F150 you also took delivery of a Super Silly Grin that you had  on your face for the entire video! 🤣😂🤣 #havingtoomuchfun
Who else is waiting for the corsa exhaust
I am absolutely thrilled about this build and project. Fantastic video and that is the most beautiful truck ever to roll down the road.
Y’all really stepped up your editing game. Nice work!
Ngl…. I didn’t realize it was Gavin narrating until 5 min in😂😅😅😅. I was too into the story of the Legend Carroll Shelby.
Twin turbo or nitrous  Badass truck man
Love the truck , but why a 4wheel drive to  single cab,  when you could have bought a crew cab 4x4 super snake ?
Bro y'all's filming and editing skills 🔥
Yooo! Congragufuckinlations Gavin.
Yoooooooooooo i am so ready
Called it... Except i thought it was red
I love these trucks
Two videos a week and this one is just a preview of following videos….uhhh
Racetruck 2.0
I’m pissed that I live in Vegas and knew absolutely nothing !
Think the shelby mustang is cool
THE CHILLS I GOT
The editing in this video is INSANE.
Sounds like a 7.3 twin turbo maybe
bang up job on this video, what a great tribute and away to show the next generation those boomers were onto something!! stay safe and take care everyone rest in peace mr shelby!!!!
Goosebumps from that Intro omg!!
Giveaway coming soon ?
You guys are makin a name for yourself. You guys just keep growing amazing
Intro 10/10 🔥 made me wanna rewatch Ford vs farrari
Your content quality increase this last year is just insane. Been here for a long time and never been disappointed 👊
“Lady bug killa” killer?
I have a feeling you're going to make is a 1200 horsepower monster of a truck
Finally somebody did it.
I hope u keep this one
Can’t wait!!!!
That’s how you make a fucking video! Love this so much! Always have found inspiration in your videos! Can’t wait for this build👀 #dontlosesight #dls #itsjusta6
THIS IS SO AWESOME
Yesssssa
This is my dream truck you just made me love your channel even more! Bro i can’t wait for this content my uncle gots a 4 door all white with blue stripes and keeps it in the garage only drove it to his house and that’s it
Too bad y’all can’t finish the first truck build
this was deep bro
all that money and the fkin thing still got halogen bulbs haahaha
Twin turbo? 🤔
damn bud moving up in this world haha love the inspirational video hahah
20, blew the engine in my Honda a few months back, sh*tty life growing up, working my ass off in a machine shop in Louisiana (Originally From California), living with my Co-worker and His Yota is on its last breathe, near impossible to save for a car when all my money goes to bills. Hope someone see’s this depressing ass post. Not having a great night, love the Videos 😓
How does a super snake not automatically come with a blower. Love the truck tho regardless.
anyone else curious how long till its twin turboed lol
Can wait for this giveaway 😎😂
Hell of an intro 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I’m so stoked to see this build. I live in Vegas and drive by Shelby all the time.
Can’t wait for the end of this sick build💯💯💯👀💨
Hell yeah. Bad ass truck. Still trying to win the giveaway of building the car we already own HAHHAHAH. Nothing more than I want then my magnum to be bad ass
Gavin stays blowing our minds with these new cars!
Didn’t even know they specd these without the supercharger. Thought they were all making 770hp 🤔
Gavin became a sneaker head low key
Mf'kin into looked like a new Forza Horizon trailer lmfao
Definitely love the vibe and way this video was made!
Now that's a truck...
Why isn’t it super charged ?
He’s gonna turbo it I’m callin it
Man doesn’t upload videos, he uploads whole movies
Gavin I'm serious you guys are super talented and this by far besides getting the 2010 Camaro back. This by far is one of Your best videos out there
Carrol Shelby actually passed on my birthday. It was one of the worst birthdays that I have had. When an icon and role model is lost it is never a good day. Very excited to see this build.
Oh hell yeah big turbo? All the boost all the wheels!
Worth it
I like how we get teased with an amazing video and we get is b-roll of the stuff we want to see
Hy bro 😎🔥💯
Since nobody else seems to want to guess, I am gonna throw it out there that this would make a fantastic drift truck, and I don't think people are expecting that 😉
Shelby's version of the lightning. I have a 94 lightning, it makes around 600hp. I think the Shelby supersnake, which is considered a lightning by many people. Love this truck, the Shelby cobra, the mustangs, and the lightnings! ⚡️ Are those traction bars under there to prevent wheel hop? It even has the side exit that a lot of people put on their lightnings.
This is literally the best and most inspiring video
Sweet mother of god...
Puro takuachando cuh!!! 🤟🏽🤟🏽
Y’all ready to see this truck for 2 weeks then it brakes then we don’t see it for 9 months
Shelby America sponsorship coming to a channel near you
I guess it's to late to use the ima keep it stock meme isn't it
My dream build is a 2012 mustang GT with the 7.3 l Godzilla engine in it I'm going to work on the developing a kit for that with one of the shops and where I live
Thanks to the guy that sent you the link to this truck
Twin turbo SHELBY😀
Great video ! Awesome intro. Can't wait for the build !
This video is so fireee!!!!
In comes a new intro for a car
This may be the greatest video I’ve ever watched
Your edits are amazing
Reasons I keep watching, you guys always find newer things, better things and inspire us all. I still remember the beginnings, with the Corvette, and the Camaro, that broke like every video. Now you have some insane cars. Really cool to see that you really started from scratch man.
Twin charged Fully built Super Snake F150 half mile truck? Maybe?
Did I hear him saying something about that being in a future giveaway or am I just hearing things cause I’m excited 🥺😁😁
Bro I will bet money that that’s going to be a give away car. Or he’s going to twin turbo it
Dammm it looks so badass best looking single cab truck for sure
That's the true Shelby way fuck a trailer I'm driving it for the love of speed RIP Shelby your name still lives on god speed
I got chills when they played the news clip bro 🤧
You now have a cooler truck than justin
WOW!
we’re never gonna see the back car anymore lol. bad ass video tho
That car is ugly  no cap
Definitely not a truck you want to absolutely destroy with a lift
I just got a job at Ford yesterday and then this video came out it’s my calling!
Worth the waittttt
Love the video and the history on Shelby! Hoping to see more on ur other 2 mustangs soon.
Glad a real car dude owns number 1 of 2fifty n not just some rich dude that wanted to have that one just to NEVER drive.
🐐
if anyone’s wondering about why he mentioned post malone and how is truck was the first one sold, at one point one of traces albums was at higher listens then hollywood’s bleeding at one point, og fans remember;)
if this becomes a giveaway truck i am entering in soooo many times lol
Shelby has just knock the ball out of the field like what they do is so amazing and awesome
I’m stoked for this!
Son are we gonna get a dual charged 1500HP build
Holy shit!!!!!!!!!
Fucking sick
hell i cant afford a good used S10 i need really bad I'm do damn poor
These cinematic videos are probably the best on youtube. Each one is just so powerful.
Production quality on this off the wall !!!
I was talking about the super snake f-150s for like the last month and then you get one. My jealousy is immense rn
hard to say how excited I am for this new truck it’s on my dreams to own a Super Snake
Not gonna lie, I cried a little in remembrance of Carol Shelby.
It’s so freaking cool that you’re working with the Shelby company.  That truck is beyond ridiculously awesome.
Epic video
I told everyone in the premier Shelby F150 super snake sport 718hp 🔥🔥🔥
OMG....I’m in love. I’ve wanted to build a RCSB F-150 for years. This is going to drive that further into my want now. Thanks a lot. 🙄
I ALMOST bought one….then my wife wanted the Mini Cooper gp3 instead…..
Yyyyyeah unfollow
Hold up I went to Las Vegas ???? But in your story’s on insta and snap you said you went to Chicago and brought the car on trailer...
The cold chills
Impressive credentials, gentleman!
i seen this in the last video but i never said it
It gave me the chils
In at just 3:40 and I have to pause and say the intro, production, and editing is Legendary. This channel is top notch!
Yooooooo man I love it bratha keep up the amazing work💯💯
You should build a replica cobra
Damn nice montage/tribute. 👏🏼
Omfg please let this be a future giveaway said @0:01 @11:48 noticed that this was just a long add about my extended auto warranty
Hello my name is Gavin Simon and blowing up satans engine is my business
Another one 🇺🇲
Si quema cuhh
such a beautiful truck
This video screams david dobrik
What in the chimichangas
Dude that’s one of my dream trucks 🤤🤤🔥🔥
😲
Yessssss!!!!!!!!
That’s a good looking truck
Them shelbys are so ugly. I’d 1000% rather have a stock f150 front end. That front clip just makes me wanna puke in my mouth
When you’re done modifying this new Shelby are u going to give it away to a fan later on down the line????
Omg another  ford
Don’t give to truck away please I want to see this on the channel for a while.
Sick
This is amazing sent shivers down my spine
I've loved seeing the work and watching girls grow over the past year and a half keep it up Gavin ( from Australia )
What do I think you will do with it? Race each other on the street…make unreliable horsepower…break it…fix it…repeat.
Watching Gavin detailing his own truck made me proud
Now this deserves my like… and I never do!
THIS GAVE ME CHILLS! Amazing video guys!
It looks like the race truck has some competition 🤙🏽🤙🏽
This is how the motor industry should sell the product...forward thinking like these boys at 6 media...it shows me how a frigging truck has all of us licking our lips....
Only he would pay triple for a single cab f150 with a body kit and some suspension upgrades. I know he’s gonna make millions$ with the videos to come with the build but it still blows my mind how expensive a few decals can be.
Tell Doug you want a rematch but with the super 🐍!!!! 😂😂😂😂
Opening cut to the rollers on the strip was beautiful
Welcome to the F-150 gang
Nice mamalona cuh
as long as it doesnt become a giveaway allgood
There is a lifted one and slammed one where I live
I work down in Cameron,LA and some one down there that works at the facility has a dark gray version of this truck it's so awesome looking!
Dope truck ever
Gavin help me, I’m being humiliated by my friends😩 they gap me cuz I don’t have header😢
Shelby is the biggest and best name in the game.
Let’s guess it’s the next giveaway car
You just bought my dream truck!!!! My attainable truck is a Tundra.

Most hardest video on youtube

Holy shit dude im filled with goosebumps
Quema o no quema 🔥

That was an amazing video and can't wait to see you transform that beast.
so now u will trash it and make it sht with sht mods or u will respect the legacy and keep it as it is? 🤔
Man this is what I love about you. Buying these exotic rides and NOT letting them sit dormant. You actually get out and DRIVE your cars/trucks. #1 car channel on YouTube in my opinion.
One of my bosses had one of these it was insane for sure worth the price congrats man
I’m gonna call it now.. he’s gonna throw a wide body kit on it make it hella stanced with shit loads of camber bro. Race 1984 stalk sealed camaro’s and brag about how fast it is
Going to be wicked for sure!
I’m 4:24 into this video and all I have to say is. PLEASE GAVIN FOR THE LOVE OF CARS PLEASE KEEP THIS TRUCK! Keep it because you can afford to love and cherish this truck the way it should be taken care of instead of giving it away as the next give away to some one that can barely afford it if be able to afford it at all...
“And you can win this truck in next weeks give away” jk awesome truck
Love it man. Can’t wait to see what kind of plans you have for this truck. I watch every single one of your videos and they are absolutely amazing . I absolutely love your content!!
I'm a Chevy guy at heart but Mr. Shelby god bless your soul what an amazing twist in between a Ford 🐎mustang 🐎 and a Ford ⚡ lightning ⚡!¡God 🙏 Bless 👍👍🇺🇲🏁🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
10:27 to 10:32 Gave me NOTHING BUT CHILLS 😩😩 and the shaking camera angle when the truck came around the corner and started to speed up 👏🏾👏🏾
I will be honest I am so invested in this brand and the team literally makes me emotional every time they make a big move I am just fucking proud all around of the team and gavin
Crazy to think that I just watch Ford v Ferrari and got informed of everything that happened!!!!!
shit just got real
U could start doing movies dang that was good
i’m getting goose bumps bro
I saw one in Blue Ridge Georgia in Blue and Black and thought nothing of it. I got home and did research and thought it was kinda cool. Now you guys got one and I’m stoked at what you guys plan to do with it.
Honestly Shelby has made one of the Cleanest and by far great cosmetic looking trucks now my boy Gavin is gonna wake up the beast withing this truck 🥵
We need to see a gt500 on the channel
Ya I’m pretty siked for this build especially as a truck guy another killer video and intro
Midnight performance can get that truck super sauced up for y’all 👀
Well I be damn 🤠🕺😃 (throw my hat on the ground) I been look for a 5.0 single cap myself 😅 boy y’all be coming with that heat 🥵❤️‍🔥 I love it you motivate me to keep working on this grind of YouTube I be there in few years 😎
🤷‍♂️ a new shelby mustang would of been cooler but it will do i guess 🤔
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Do u like hellcat
Ohh lord, that thing is beautiful
Fuck ya can’t wait to see all the videos
Wtf!!! Like that’s one of the dopest thing I’ve ever seen. Like what carrol did during his career and for the car world is unmatched. That’s why I have a huge respect for him
I literally seen one in RI...
FINALLY
Earned a like right away. Love you guys. Don’t Lose sight.
I was named after him and my dad has a 89 shelby dakota pickup!!
Holy mother of fucking production value. This video gave me chills just like the first time I watched Ford V Ferrari. Good job boys!
What an absolute banger to a new vehicle.
Why not replace the black car with a Mustang Shelby Super Snake
I feel like I  just watch the trailer to a movie bruh and I am so excited
Imma use the intro as a project
This to me is like do you believe in fate never saw this coming
My best guess is going to be pairing with RPG face engine and putting a built 5.0 coyote or building the stock MOTOR with a big single turbo or supercharger
I’m ready for that giveaway.
HELL YEAHHHHHHHH
Hell yeah!! This truly brings a smile to my face and a tear to my eyes...LETS FRICKIN GO! Keep up the goodness you bring
Had to stop working loving the intro u did that
Helll yeah I knew was gonna man be another race truck hell yeah I’m soooo fucking hyped!!!!
My guy coming in with my Dream Truck so stoked for the build
Top level production quality
Trokiando cuh
It’s just a F150…
One of your best videos man!
I can’t wait for this build!
SQUAT IT‼️‼️‼️ jkjk lol ........ Unless⁉️⁉️⁉️  Lemme stop playin 😂
I don’t mean to jump the gun but I definitely see this as being a future giveaway. Like after it’s been built and they’ve had there fun with it. I don’t think it was bought with the purpose of being a giveaway vehicle but I think it’s a possibility
I'm so excited to see this on your channel. I watch every episode and I love trucks
Wow. I did not see that coming. Amazing
I honestly think you got this is because you might give it away
Gavin Making takuaches happy
I think our dealer has one not online, dealer only so it goes local people.  They have like 6 black widows 3 harleys a shelby mustang all types of shit but its all dealer only no online ads  I shouldnt say think i know they had one crew cab but dunno if its sold yet
Who ever edit all of that needs a raise
I watch and give thumbs up, but it's rare for me to comment, something I just don't do a whole lot. But make no mistake I love itsjusta6 materiel. The  last time I think I commented on any of your videos is when you raced Demonology and blew your car up and people were giving you hate. Watching this video and looking back on your journey in your ups and downs...trial and errors. Knowing this is going to be another exciting adventure for you, your crew and subscribers. I and a lot of your subs feel the excitement as if we're there, in a sense we are. So thank you for doing what you do, keep on doing it...don't lose sight.
Can we just appreciate that this TRUCKS 0-60 is a supposed 3.45 seconds!
Honestly never expected this, very unique truck and an awesome build coming soon
Are we potentially looking at the future give away 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
My moms buddy’s dad was Shelbys best friend. I had the opportunity of meeting Carroll Shelby himself about 12 years ago, he was driving a pro type gt500, basically a S197 with the 2013 GT500 5.8 in it. It was a pro type engine. He took me and my moms friend for a ride around San Bernardino and boy was that thing fast as hell and made 11’s everywhere it went. I haven’t been able to find anything about that car but definitely an amazing experience. I was only in 7th grade but still a blast
That truck is amazing and love the content man
GAVIN BRO... You got my DREAM CAR, I'M LITERALLY LIKE 🤯🤯🤯🤯 NO WAY
Takuache cuh !!!!   La Mamalona !!! Cuh !!
This is gonna be so sick
Wait I could’ve sworn there was that exact one selling 30 mins from my house.
Perfect addition
Loving the content! Noticed you have similar music playlists as myself. Check solshinobi on soundcloud and look at the mustang images for the playlist. Ridetoit
Save the autos?
Sick fucking truck!!!!😭
Saw Gavin in this truck this past weekend and that truck is bad ass!!!
Fucking sick that is what I like to see
Yes sir love it
As I clicked off this video it was apparent Gavin did indeed buy the last one, the next video recommendation was “the release of the Ford lightning” by none other then Ford
AMERICA, AINT IT GREAT
I just screamed like it was me getting this truck
Needs a camo wrap like luifers
Damn this was so good!!!! Can’t wait for more videos!!
You guys have the most amazing cinematography and editing skills!  Keep it up.  Especially enjoyed the Shelby history.
I was really hoping for a cobra
Super awesome vid can’t wait to see the next. Awesome truck. Probably the most bad ass thing I have seen yet on this channel. Just keeps getting better every video🤘
All I have to say is   *chills*
It would be cool so see a Shelby GT500 Motor dropped in to become 💯 Shelby.
Completely different content from anyone on YT love this build already
But will this one run properly?
This is so awesome 🥺🥰 R.I.P the one the only , legend carroll Shelby
Buy it to drive it
I KNEW IT LOL You can see it in the last upload right around 50sec mark
Holy shit this is awesome!!
I haven’t been a fan of the other truck build since it’s not my style, but if you’re doing twins on this I am absolutely stoked to see this build progress
Youve GOT to minimize the fleet. Get rid of the Chevy truck now that u got this. There’s WAY too many cars and projects to keep up with stick with like 3 maybe 4 MAX man it’s just getting annoying having so much to keep up with actually wants us to watch less not more
SICK
Please don’t give it away im so hyped to see this build
yall made a movie take like 10 minutes
Didn’t even realize Gavin was the one talking in the intro till like two mins in 🤣 holly fuck the man can do anything .. this is why Gavin is the goat 🐐
Alpha Rex headlights ASAP!! Trust me you won’t regret it
You missed a spot 8:46
I’ve been missing these kinds of reveals
The power of a tweet can be astronomical...
All my teachers said ill never be shit.....ya well my favorite youtuber just bought a shelby truck
Carroll Shelby will always be a legend to the cart world. He is the reason why I named my dog after him. Rest easy sir. You will be missed by everyone who loves cars even if they aren't a Mustang fan.
Smells like the single cab Silverado is next on give away cutting board 🤔🤔
Props to Andrew and the crew on the editing,  this is the best produced video so far
My dream truck, NOOO!!!!!!  now I’ll never get one😭😭
okay, so, truck mod checklist:  1. supercharger 2. lowering kit 3. tune 4. probably front lip, and side skirts 5. maybe a rear wing
Off topic but what is your subway order?
I’m prob the only one who thought 2020 GT500
The new Ford Lightning
I just love the video production
Hell yeah bro can't wait to see this one
Man I seen a picture from the track this weekend of this truck and I seen Daniel and the other guys in the background and possibly the camaro next to it? I kinda had a hunch this may have been it.
I had chills like through 90% of the video, love it!
Led me find you a cuhh now 😂😂 Only a few people will understand...
love how the history was shared very movie like
There is a dealership in Wisconsin with every shelby available.  There lineup of super snake f150s is huge. They have a youtube channel called kunestv.
One of my friend got one all blacked out that thing is killer
Would be dope if you guys did a merch collab as well! Maybe soon? 👀
They finally bought a car well truck and got home with out a problem lol
The intro was sick af
Wish the video was longer lol
Love the voice over
What do y’all recommend for engine oil and weight  for 2020 5.0 f150 10spd drive the shit out of my trucks first time owning a Ford
This gave me chills
I kinda guessed it, but frick yea!
Pls don’t give it away I’m begging u
This channel is going on an another level
Either gonna be a fat positive displacement blower or a big centrifugal supercharger
dude you came a LONG way from racing some old guy in a hellcat, to being known by Shelby American themselves ‼️🇺🇸
OH MY GOOODNEESSSS
Broooooo, Content just keeps getting better!!!!
Was hoping you were at shelby for something like this!! So many people.go but dont buy or ever plan on buying a shelby.
At an airport where  I work for my parent’s airplane company one of our customers has a 4 door F150  super snake Shelby and it’s really beautiful!
Thx for lil history lesson Gavin
Videos are edited perfect, love these types of videos you put up 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
imma be hella mad if this a new give away car
When you just done watching the ford vs Ferrari
Seemed like a new Scotty Kilmer video at first😂
A1 VIDEO PRODUCTION
Upgraded headlight and taillights is a must on this one.
Never mind how freakin bad A$$ the truck is, but Jesus, Y’all’s video production skills are second to literally no one on YouTube right now!
Gavin and the team are hands down the pinnacle of the best YouTube channel out there, even named my latest son ruston from the town that gavin has grown the greatest YouTube content to date from....HATS OFF FOR THE CREW AT ITSJUSTA6!!!!!!!!
My Silverado Is Faster Cuh 🛻🔥
I started watching on the c6 series and the transformation of the channel has been insane. Keep up the good shit guys the videos always make my days better
That intro literally gave me the chills. Can't wait to see what you do to her/him.
Aw Hell Yeah! Super excited for this project!
Quality Video 🐐
kinda expected a cobra, but not complaining
I swear to god if this is the next give away, I'm buying double of everything.
this makes me realize how disrespectful it was to make the mustang a electric suv. cmon ford. why :(
Love this video
LETS GOOOOOOO
WHIPPLE!!!!!
TWIN CHARGE IT
I love the intro
I was wondering 6 months ago if yiur doing another truck build. Then I saw this and I saw the thumbnail. I new it was a Shelby pickup truck.
Congrats dude you deserve it !!
Gavin I called it on your Instagram posttttt
You definitely need to keep this truck, no giving it away and build a nice street truck
What about your gm truck 😧 are you keeping it?
Beyond. Fucking. Impressed. Videos don’t stop getting better. Love the channel, and watching you turn yourself into a brand. Easily my biggest inspiration on YouTube.
this is by far hands down the best video you ever created your absolutely killing the game bro keep up the awesome work
Who else said "sheeeesh" when the truck came out hahhaah
Next giveaway I’m calling it.
You better not make that the next give away car
This literally sent fucking chills literal chills throughout my body and trust me its never happened omgg
Twin Turbo Shelby f150 build

That is so awesome
Only a matter of time before he purchases something from Hennessey

LS SWAP IT !!’
Anyone else spot Adam LZ at 0:47?

Corsa Catback Exhaust is $1,345... I know it's probably already at the shop waiting to get slapped on.. but just in case🤙🏿
Crazy!!’ One of the best videos so far
I’m sorry but I hate it but I’m happy you got it bro excited to see what you’re gonna do with it 😂

Called  this after catching a glimpse of it at 50 seconds into last upload! So pumped for this!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🐍🐍🐍🐍
We had one of these at the dealership I work at, was a blast to drive
I thought he bought a 500😂😂
Beanz
Man this channel is quickly becoming my top favorite automotive YouTube channel.  The cinematography, the track selection, the structure of the production, the variety, just.. everything.  So excited for this project, all the other ones in progress, and any future projects to come.  Cheers!
Rip Ken miles what a amazing racer
Would anyone else love to hear Gavin voice over a documentary or something?
I bet he’s going to do twin turbos
I can't wait to see some 1000whp 4wd launches 👀
Dubs♥️
Thats one hell of a reveal! Holy shit I can wait for that beast
Will he slam it or will he lift it?!?!?!
This into reminded me of the forza horizon 2 intro
THATS CRAZYYYY THING IS SWEET CONGRATULATIONS GAVIN!
I can not wait to see this build. 1k+WHP f-150🤔
Please don't break it.
Just gets better and better sheesh
Trade you trucks
Yooooooo totally didn’t expect the truck 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Chills
Holy shit 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
I fucking cried
And I am 15
A FUCKING SUPER SNAKE😦
Just a absolutely beautiful truck the videos was amazing as well been along for the ride for many years now. Oh and the last quote from mr Shelby Shelby is the truest shit iv ever heard.
Last time that truck ran well....
20 bucks says they put amsoil in not Castrol 😳
You are living my dream
Here’s the next giveaway guys
cool
I thought you were getting a ford GT. Would love to see that vs the McLaren. Road track.
I think you need to remake the Trackhawk towing the hellcat with the Shelby F-150 Towing the GT350 🙏🏻
Super charger 🔌
When you are done with it you you should bring it up to Michigan and take it to Ford headquarters and Carroll shelby way it’s by fords testing track
Wow. That's going to be crazy fun
YESSSSSS
Twin turbo y’all peep the badge?
Yessss fucking sirrrrrrrr!!!! Trucks vs the world
That car looks so sick. 😁
I love that tuck, great color spec too!! Excited to see what's to come. Mr. Shelby would probably say "going to leave it stock". Then would start tossing parts at it.
New shop truck I hope... I know to nice but damn
This was so heartwarming omg you guys are so amazing 🖤🖤 I never really knew the story of Shelby until Ford vs Ferrari and that’s when I started taking a big liking to Mustangs I love this a lot 🖤
Best vehicle you have on the channel
Who here seen ford v Ferrari?
why do I have the feeling they are gonna do something really extreme and twin charge it
Next giveaway after fully built
Speaking of a Shelby super truck we have one in my town
Broo i was so lost in the intro i forgot i was watching an itsjusta6 video
This has to be the coolest video for a live stream
i'm so happy😩
So sick! Needs morimoto headlights immediately
Holy that’s a sick truck
Now this is a giveaway truck can get behind.
Ken miles and Shelby are the best two in racing I think. They caused a lot of ruckus and won at the largest race at the time. 🤷🏼‍♂️
There’s a point at 7,000 rpm where everything fades...
I wanted a black car update more
Ironic because the Super Snake Sport is like a modern Lightning. And Ford is revealing the new "Lightning" today.
Bro I can not believe you just g,or a Shelby truck. I’ve only seen a few in person but I can’t wait to see this build. Thx Gavin for having such a good taste in cars
Dubs
Try number 3 for Gavin to see this...your flag is backward brotha. Sick truck tho cant wait for the build🤙
why do I have a feeling this is going to be a giveaway truck
im so happy for your continued success and videos man congrats.....ill add i literally felt my hair stand up watching this. If you wanna go fast go alone, if you wanna go far build a team....and youve got one helluva team my guy.
Wasn’t expecting another truck but that is an amazing truck and I’m looking forward to seeing what’s coming down the pipe line. I understand that you need content but please don’t forget satan that’s still one bad ass car even if she doesn’t act right all the time. Be safe and god bless y’all
Shelby is by far one of the best to ever do it.
What a beautiful truck!
Vmp blower off of Satan is going on the truck. Calling it now.
Y’all made a mini movie
Wow this is going to be amazing build
Shelby lived 30 miles from where I been my whole life.

Be badass for Gavin and the team to become like a branded company for Ford cars and trucks kinda like Roush or Hennessy or something of that sort.
Very classy.  Nicely done!
