Prayers for her...!!!!
❤❤❤🙏🏾🙌🏾
Papa bear is a s er.
😢
She's beautiful 😍 👍🏾💃🏽
Perhaps Mr/Ms Strahan should refrain from wearing dressES. When he stops bending over for the BOOGEYMAN, The Most High will stop the punishment! Just a thought. #seedmixing
I don’t know how many times I have watched this video and everytime I do I cry buckets of tears 😭May God heal Isabella completely 🙏
So glad she is doing well ❤
I pray for Isabella and the Strahan family.
Just lost my precious father to glioblastoma in October!!! 😢🙏🏼for all cancer patients
Who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,
Why is this news?
You are such an inspiration. Keep fighting on and I hope and pray for a full recovery for you Isabella! ❤❤ you are so strong.
shes absolutely gorgeous, wish her the best
I just want to let you know i am a brain  tumor servivor  the same feeling i was feeling when i find out rite  so i send my love to you to let you know we are strong and will be great . My own was 2014. And a size off a tennis ball .
Why does Michael Strahan have to spread his daughter out across the country on national television and her issue with cancer? Haven't we heard and seen enough stories about someone's cancer or experienced it in our own families? This is depressing and he needs to keep it private to himself. Big pharma doesn't want there to be a cure for cancer, even though there is a cure. There's too much money to be made with cancer with the drugs, and all the medical staff and doctors will keep their high paying jobs by not seeing a cure for cancer on the scene. Remember Farrah Fawcett documentary with her cancer battle? That was horrible enough to watch. Maybe Michael Strahan needs to take a few years off to be with his daughters. He loves his money.
Isabella is such a light with a beautiful spirit full of optimism, joy and positivity.  She is beautiful, strong, and such a silent powerhouse.  May GOD bless her and her family.  I thought Michael was very strong during this interview because I would have been a mess. So thankful he chose Robin Roberts to conduct the interview.  Continued great health for them all.
Praise God she doing good God is in control she has a beautiful soul my prayers to her family ❤
God Bless your journey and you’re not alone 🙏🏽
Praise God for a well connected family. Good luck Isabella❤❤❤
Isabella you are a 🌟 STAR ⭐️  I said I wasn’t gonna cry too🥹 💞🌸💞🌸🙏🏽💞🌸💞
Ur a champ God bless you 😢my prayers to you and your family God got you he is with you always🙏❤️
The way I just cried 😢!!!! Lord healed your daughter.
This poor baby
Pray to the Lord❤ great story
My dad died of stage 4 cancer in 2009 when I was 14 years old.  Isabella good job at fighting the cancer, you are very lucky and strong.
❤❤❤ you got this❤❤❤
God bless you, Isabella. You are a beautiful and healthy young woman with a wonderful future ahead. I'm so glad we have supported St. Jude's every month for  years, when I see a success story like yours. God bless you, Michael for all that you endured in the journey. As parents, we wish we could just trade places when our children are hurting. I see that God has given you all the tools necessary to be a supportive daddy! Continued blessings for all!
Bless their hearts. I pray and lift Isabella up to you dear lord that her brain cancer is healed and that Michael and his family stays strong through all of this never gives up in christ name amen
Love U Isabella♥️

My Wife & I Pray for U Isabella.. 🙏.. stay strong.. your in our prayers and our thoughts and our hearts❤’s
God Bless U Isabella 🙏
Isabella, don't ever lose hope. Get yourself immersed in doctors who think outside the box and give you hope and use evidenced based medicine with therapies outside conventional medicine. Patients who have the most success take an integrative, holistic approach and I pray you are working with all types of doctors. I'm an Oncology Acupuncturist and work in a Holistic Oncology Clinic in Chicagoland. I use herbs, Acupuncture, lymphatic drainage and Chinese manual therapy to balance the body and stimulate the immune system and combat the side effects of conventional medications and therapies for many cancer patients. The doctors I work alongside with offer hyperbaric oxygen chamber, hyperthermia, mistletoe, nutritional counseling, supplementation, herbs, lifestyle, behavioral/mental/spiritual counseling along with IPT - Insulin Potentiated Chemotherapy, and more.. There are so many resources out there for you, don't ever give up! We are praying for you. If you are ever in the Chicagoland area, please reach out to me. Check out Nourish Natural Healthcare and the Ayre Clinic in illinois. God bless you. Keep on fighting.
I'm 28 and ive been having headaches each day , last Monday I  felt nauseous and its in the back of my head and pain killers dont work what do I do ? Just curious
GET RID OF STRAGAN !!! 🤨
PRAYERS GOING OUT TO MICHAEL & HIS FAMILY🙏🏽
Michael we all never want to hear unexpected  diagnosis and It wasn't pleasant to hear about your daughter diagnosis. I'm so very happy to hear your daughter made a remarkable recovery.
My prayers are with u Isabella.    ❤❤❤❤
Mr Strahan.. i wish the very best for your daughter and the rest of your family sir
Isabella is grateful and Dad is terrified and I can tell he broke down ❤
The food gives you cancer…We have to stop eating unnatural foods.
What a beautiful, beautiful young lady! Her looks, her poise, her confidence, so well spoken and you can tell her heart is beautiful as well!♥️
Look how they live promoting having cancer. They now shave there heads ahead of treatment.  Idiots. Look how calm he is. This is bulls#-$
I'm
Clot shot
Hope that she feels better soon
Hope your daughter starts to feel better. Michael, I lost my dad after a ten-year battle of lung cancer. He died on October 10th,  2015. Nine days before my 46th birthday.      My mom passed due to pancreatic cancer on July 17th,  2023.
I'm just now knowing this news and for some reason I can't stop crying.
TO THOSE SPECIALTY NEWSCASTERS [“GOOD MORNING, AMERICA”] AND Y’ALL, “LATEST GMA VIEWERS, ‘DUE TO THIS FEMALE PRO-GRAD’S HEALTH ISSUES [AFRO’AMERICAN],’ MAY YOUR ‘HEAVENLY FATHER HELP AN UNRIGHTEOUS TO BECOME’ RIGHTEOUS!” 😹😹
It breaks my heart to see her cry and I pray 🙏 that the lord heals her and takes that horrible disease from her in Jesus precious name Amen God bless
Hey Stray, it was wonderful to see Isabella dancing after completing chemotherapy. I'm so happy for her. Yeah, I have a happy song for her. It's CeCe Winans - "That's My King. " Give her the video with the lyrics to it just in case she wants to sing along.  I'm so happy for her!!!
Michael.. just my opinion.. should not have promoted the little trans boy on your show.. saying what he n his parents were doing was a good thing when fact theyve done nothing but groom their own little boy out to drag bars n drugs.. you protect all children.. even at tge cost of your job if necessary.. chickens came home to roost so they say
She looks very white
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I pray that Isabella gets healed.  ❤my love for you for sharing your story stay strong . She reminds me of a young lady on A G T who was known as Night bird. Let go let God take the wheel. Please Please call on Jesus Christ for help because he will. He died so that we can have life and have it more abundantly.  May God bless you and keep you make his face shine on you and be Gracious to you; and lift you up with his countenance and give you his peace. ❤❤🎉
You are such a precious young lady.
I love Michael Strahan he's my television hero
Omgosh, she is so incredible to share the reality of how tender & a persevering spirit one goes through. I'm a Cancer survivor & I still grieve certain things. However the other side of that coin, I'm so grateful for my Faith, husband, medical team, loved one's & so many prayers. Isabella, many are praying for you sweet nena. Peace be with your beautiful heart &    mind mija 🙏.  "Isa"
Imagine not having healthcare or terrible insurance in this situation.
She's so beautiful!!❤
U are so strong, keep fighting and find the courage to truly live your life. Do whatever u want to do in your life. Such a beautiful lady🌹💯❣️Let your heart always keep shining!

God. Bless. You. And. Your.  Flamly.
Terribly sad. I was in tears seeing that beautiful young woman cry. I hope she comes out of this soon and lives a long, happy life.
My wife and I cried so much watching this video. It was very difficult to watch because it brought back memories when my 15 year old son was diagnosed with cancer. May God Bless you with lots of strength so you can beat this cancer.
My heart goes out to Isabella and the Strahan family.  Dear Heavenly Father, I pray that you hold this family close and that you allow us all to know that you can do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think.  I repeatedly tell people that both my parents are from a set of twins, my mom - fraternal, and my biological dad - identical.  I personally know that God is able give life and save lives, so I give him glory and honor for working and performing miracles.  Thank you Robin Robert’s for holding that space ❤💯%!
Isabella you are a very beautiful woman!!! 😘
Ahh, Isabella & Michael Strahan I’m sending you my deepest sympathies for your terrible experience with this horrible brain tumour. In some way words can be hard to convey just how awful & sad/heartwrenching it is to go through. May the Lord Jesus Christ Almighty God be with you & your whole family every single day. 🙏☺️I wish you the very best outcome. Of course sweetheart you’re absolutely allowed to feel your feelings period. ♥️

My own support is so important and I'm leaning on my support. There is a lot and I'm so thankful for it. But also acknowledging that this is a part of my wonderful Mother's story and each day I have to be with her, to  watch her, help her, I honor her story. Being diligent about finding joy in this hard situation.🙏🏾

ISABELLA is so BEAUTIFUL 😍
I completely understand. My daughter was diagnosed with stage four brain cancer in the frontal. She’s 33 years old. It was doing the pandemic. I felt completely helpless. But she has a resilience to move on. You guys continue to fight. Kassner is not going to find you. You’re gonna give a lot of people much hope. We love you guys. My thoughts and prayers are with both of you. My daughters name is Justine. You pray for her as well.
Isabella you are such a strong beautiful young woman you can do that, keep staying strong. 🤗❤️❤️❤️🙏
In my PRAYERS God Bless you all
God Bless 🙏🏽Michael, Isabella and family❤ Love You 🥰 12:12

I’m sorry to see what you and your family going through with your daughter. Is through these most difficult times that strengthen you to the core. Pray for you and your family and God Bless
It’s so difficult to deal with an operation and then continue to deal with chemotherapy/radiation therapy.  I know exactly how that is.  Be strong and every day will be a tiny bit better. ❤❤ Sending you and those affected by cancer all my love.
Michael, you are an amazing Father  My prayers are with you and your family  Stay Strong Isabella I’m so proud of like your dad said you got this.
I found with the diagnosis I have Glioblastoma, it is better to share, spread awareness and have everyone pray and provide support to be at peace and enjoy each day of life.  This is “our” story
You know how many people in this world are going through something bad like this ? Why do they only give celebrities the spotlight on their lives when something like this happens?
🙏🙏🙏
WHY GOOD PEOPLE SUFFER.AND EVIL PEOPLE LIVE FOR EVER . BUT I NOW GOD IS IN CONTROL BUT YOU WONDER SOMETIMES.😢
Keeping you and Isabella in my prayers 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻♥️♥️♥️♥️
God bless you and keep up the good fight🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻♥️♥️😅
God Bless Isabella 🙌 And Her Family On Pressing Forward 🙏 ❤️
Praying for you as I’m currently fighting this battle with breast cancer. Everyone wanted me to take off work and I truly believe that continuing to maintain some since of normalcy has helped with my healing. I’ve had chemo, surgery, radiation, and now I’m about to start a chemo pill.   We’re all allowed to have our moments… cause this mess is not easy, but keep those positive thoughts and vibes and you will keep kicking cancers butt! #warrior #survivor #kickcancersbutt
This story is inspiring with an amazing dad, journalist who can relate to the situation and a daughter who is beautiful and stronger than she realizes. I cant wait to watch you finish chemo, college, and enjoy your friends and family. You will always remain in my prayers. Hold on and do not ever give up because god is always besides you
Mr. Michael,  My 79 year.old.Mom and I support St. Jude! You and your daughter's transparency make me care more.about others and having purpose with my heart and charity. Both of you be strong!
I pray for that you have a complete recovery. You are very courageous to share your story with the world. I hope you will inspire many young people going through cancer treatment. Thanks so much. 🙏
Prayer going out to the Strahan’s family healing in the name of Jesus Christ. To a road to recovery to you Isabella hold on to your positive spirit.
If I ever have to go through such a horrendous experience, like beautiful Isabella has to, I wish I could have a father like Michael by my side. He looks so powerful, positive and comforting. I pray for a quick and complete recovery🙏🏻.
God Bless You

After watching this segment of Isabella  Strahan's, Michael Strahan's of (Good Morning America) daughter journey after learning she has a type of Brain Cancer; Medulloblastoma that mostly occurs in young children between the ages of 5-9. Instead of being bitter Her focus is GETTING BETTER; in order to make her world greater. They know God don't put more on us than we can bear. She see now she has a purpose that has been given to her. As a CHWI we should be able to walk with our clients  encouraging, lifting them up because we can now see the struggle they and their family has to endure.
Isabella all my best wishes to such a brave young lady. I lost my sister to brain cancer and she was a fighter like you God bless you and youre family

Blessings go out to your daughter as well as your entire family and your friends, but screw Duke when my stepmother needed a transplant. They turned her down and she passed and I am not mad at you or your celebrity status but he thankful you have it.
God bless Isabela you are a trooper strong young woman we love you prayers for Isabella snd family
She's beautiful and couregeous. God bless her. Praying for a speedy recovery 🙏 ❤
Maybe the celebrities with the most influences and power could help us clean up the world we live in so cancer can become rare again?  Ban Microtoxins, eliminate roundup sprayed on foods, require all foods to be organic, stoping the unnecessary pollution to manufacture garbage toys n such, push for cars that run on carbon dioxide ( other country’s have this!), stop the chem trails in the sky from falling on us, etc etc !   When will we have enough of this?
What an inspiration. Prayers and blessings to you and your family. May God continue to protect you and bring you peace. Thank you for sharing your story. 🙏🏾🌺

So as things came across with your daughter something similar happening to my friend's daughter. Meg is a year younger (missing her Senior year at High School). I believe these two ladies can find kinship thru this process. Absolutely they need to reach out to lean on each other. These girls need more....we need to know and understand these sweet girls perspective.     So Mr.Strahan.... I am sharing this with you because my friend (Rick Krafty) is an amazing single father and at his knees. It is hard to watch loved ones go thru this process but your child is not fair. I believe in finding others to help follow the road.
My prayers for her healing and strength for the family 🙏.
What a beautiful  soul of a young lady , she has girl power and your amazing beautiful ❤
Sending prayers for Isabella and her family. 🙏
Did she take the💉? A lot of colleges forced it. The LACK of safety is suppressed. This comment will with a be suppressed or removed.

I am so sorry
Heart wrenching. I can almost feel Michaels pride in this young woman, and the anxiety. Her sharing what she is going through is amazing. What an amazing attitude, what an amazing young lady. My thoughts are with you all.
So sad,b safe,I have small cist.

Weep with those who weep robin did*****
She is so brave. God does not give you more than you can bear. My prayers are with you and your  family for strength and remission.
Why is it that literally after decades and decades? And decades of hundreds and hundreds of millions in millions of dollars. People still have to say I have cancer with tears in their eyes. It's fucking disgusting, find a cure for this shit already. Because you people probably already have it. Unfortunately, now your daughter may not be able to use any experimental drugs thanks to joe biden.
How many vaccination boosters did she get? It's amazing how since then we'll be young people are getting cancer
Praying for you and your family as you go through this storm. God will see you through. 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Thank God for bringing her through and strengthening the family.❤
🙏🏽
Prayers for a full recovery🙏 You got this Isabella.
I hv to wear a bald head, but she is just stunning in hers. I will be praying for her. She is just stunning.

I entered the cancer family when my best friend, my daddy was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer. It still breaks me down when i think of everything we went through 🤲.  2009 he went to heaven.

She will be just fine, I’m diagnosed 13 years now, thank God I’m still here, I’m not as young as her, she’s very strong, I hope there’s no growth to do another surgery, I experience new growth 18 months later that make way for surgery #2, thank God I made it through 5 surgeries and 2 radiation include protons in NJ that’s the latter  in early 2018 for 6 week and graduated on the final day, I have no pain from then , sadly the  surgeries or tumour affected my short term memory and a my right ear  is lazy because the tumour  spread to the right ear, reason for the 5th surgery I give God thanks for life today, I survive this far 13 years later😢I’m not as young as her I diagnosed when I’m in my 40s , I’m on seizure medication from the first surgery, in 2013 during the fourth surgery I had a few seizures that resulted in a stroke when I recovered post surgery , my speech was affected more  return to normal 4 years later, I’m diagnosed with meningioma with a sad news , no treatment or cure, only surgery each time it’s grown to a stage. I have to be. Strong, I think I can cope each mri scary waiting  after each MRI result. headaches not much, if any there’s effective medication
God bless your family
Many prayers to the Strahan family . We are all thinking of you Isabella

Keeping you in daily prayer Isabella that God may give you strength and faith for full recovery.  You have so much to keep on living. There will be good days and challenging days, rollercoaster ride.

Pastor  Gregory Perkins beat "Brain Cancer" 3 times in 7 years. He was still sharing the Bible weekly. Unless he had important treatment. He will tell you GOD is a miracle worker thru Prayer 🙏 & Medicine. #Reading Bible Verses breathes GOD'S spirit to heal.
This was a beautiful interview. But I didn’t hear anyone mention their faith.  Are you praying 🙏🏾? God is a healer but you must acknowledge him and give him reverence and glory. Praying for your healing in the name Jesus.
You're young and so beautiful...I don't know you but I can see you will be a light for someone else..prayers

In Jesus Mighty and Powerful Name Amen

I cried along with you Isabella. Having been diagnosed twice with 2 different kinds of cancer, I am so grateful for every 'fresh breath' I breathe. You got this girl, let's beat cancer down.
Keep going Isabella. 🩷 It is hard. Some days you want to cry and just go back to before. But this shall pass. Trust and believe. I'm done with surgery and chemo and about to start radiation.  Big hugs and prayers for you to get thru with strength and to heal and get back to college!
Lots of good luck.
This too shall pass in Jesus name I pray...... Won't he do it..... Sending all prayer warriors and positivity your way..... BLESSINGS to all ☝️

That girl is gonna make.   I am soooo rooting for the following up video showing she doing well and back in school
You are a beautiful soul and you will get through it all, 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾😊
My heart goes out to this beautimous young lady for having the courage to tell the world what she is going through. Just the millions of people going through what she is and seemingly normally affects younger people. What an inspiration to see her strength! You have this Isabella! The whole WORLD has your back! As my late daughter would say "Ashley wouldn't tell her that her crown was crooked. She'd walk over& straighten it for her and say: You got this girl show the world your STRENGTH! Give her a humongous hug so tight that she could feel her strength passing through that hug from Ashley to her. YOU GOT THIS! I LOVE YOU MORE THAN COLORS!'' I lost Ashley to a heart attack at the age of 33 and had to come home & tell her 6 children Momma wasn't coming home. The "I LOVE YOU MORE THAN COLORS!" started one day when her son Jonathan around age 8 told his great-grandmother when he was leaving "I love you more than purple" her favorite color. Ashley turned that into "I LOVE YOU MORE THAN COLORS!'', because the world would be an ugly place without colors! Isabella from one strong woman to another and her Heavenly Baby Girl. "YOU GOT THIS! WE LOVE YOU MORE THAN COLORS! 🤗🥰😁
❤️
Your a very strong young lady. Keep your head up and keep fighting.  There's always light at the end of the tunnel.
Hi I watch your show and I'm sorry to hear about your daughter I am praying for her
God bless her and your family. ❤🎉
ST Jude Hospital  is a great hospital, Danny Thomas.  Created  this back in the 60s I'm  proud to say that I went door to door collecting money for his hospital.  Mr Thomas threw the greatest  mototown concert, in Detroit  For all the teenagers. That help. Good memories.
Love you Isabella you got this, I cheering for you.
Father give Mr. Michael and her family strength as you take them through this season of life.
God I'm asking you for a medical miracle for this baby. I believe
We love you, Isabella Strahan. You are an amazing young lady. I look forward to hearing more about your journey and seeing you return to college. You will be victorious ❤❤
Inspiring really is the last thing on her mind
That's so false. Your never given more than you can handle. Then why is there suicide?
I love this man
I'm so sorry for this tragic event, your daughter is absolutely beautiful....she's such a precious being! My father got a brain tumor when I was 15 years old and it changed everything with our lives. I'm 60 now and my father has passed years ago, and it's still a painful memory because we were all so affected by the event. If I can give advice....fasting and wheat grass, meditation, stay away form junk food....from a holistic pov.
Your an inspiration to all of us .my God Bless you through your treatment 🙏🙏🙏
No one is exempt from cancer , no matter how rich , poor, big,  little, or  famous , or not . .
Isabella u will  climb this mountain and go on in your journey in life.  Michael your a great father and God Bless your daughter and all of u have my prayers
Michael I know as a parent we want to stand in the gap and carry things like this for our children and yet we can not.  I know how this feels and at first I was in shock then I was mad, sad and afraid. I could only remember that I was raised in a christian home and I began to pray...I mean on bended knees grabbing ahold of the Throne of Grace....and the lord said he did not give me a spirit of fear but of peace, love and joy. My only son was the one with this Tumor at 13 yrs old. The lord said  "Trust me I got this."  Tom is now 43 and has never had any thing wrong from this. I pray that Gods grace surrounds you so heavy that you feel it and for Isabella... sweet baby girl the spirit of the lord is  so strong around you it's like he holds you tight in his arms.  Never ever foget this. Always look to him.  You have very important things to do soon and he will guide you through this.  Look to him in all things.
Dear Heavenly Father, we lift Isabella and her family up to You O Lord and we proclaim her complete healing in Jesus’ name.    Father, may her story be for Your Glory!  Healed in Jesus’ name! Amen.
My thoughts and prayers are with Michael's daughter Isabella and family, that God will put his healing hands on Isabella and her doctors treating her.  And give her strength in her treatment and recovery. God bless you 🙏❤️🙏
Covid Vac?

Isabella didn't you get married a few months ago?  In a pink dress. Right????

I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer last April 2023 at 40, Mom with Uterine Cancer July 2023 and my 43 yo brother with Colon cancer just Jan 2024.  Our lives have been filled with almost non stop chemos, surgeries and radiation treatments. Cancer definitely sucks but it’s not the end of the world. We are still grateful that at least we are alive and are still given the chance to receive treatments. Other less fortunate people didn’t wake up from their sleep or just passed from senseless crimes or accidents. Stay strong! we can beat this Isabella.
This touched my heart Isabella you are one of God chosen one's 🙏🏾💖 continue pushing you have a team that's rooting you on. Praying for total healing and thank you for sharing your story. May God continue to Bless you and your family and all of the village that's behind you. Hold on and keep living sweets you are beautiful ❤️

Had no idea the Strahan family was going through this. She is just about as tough as her dad is. He must be so proud of her.
Micheal I commend you for being a pillar in her life!!  I love girl dads🎉
God is still in control!!!  Our fate is in His hands…. I pray for your total healing and a speedy recovery
NOW, YOU KNOW YOURE A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF BEAUTY WHEN YOU CAN BE BALD AND STILL BEAUTIFUL.

We lost our 23 year son in 2022 to Osteosarcoma Cancer. He was diagnosed in 2019.    The Cancer in his body had been controlled by using Immunotherapy.    He was doing so well.    My Birthday May 2022, he wasn't feeling well, he was having headaches and problems seeing.  Doctor's found a growth in his brain's CSF.  It was inoperable.  Earth Shattering!    On Fathers Day of May 2022 He had an emergency brain surgery.  He survived for several days after the surgery, but became to rapidly decline, losing all of his ability to function, including communicate.  After many weeks in the hospital, he was able to return home, where my wife, children and friends, provided 24hr care.  He passed away Stept 27th, 2022, the day before my wife's birthday.  Best Wishes to the young lady and her family!

Praying for you Isabella! God is with you ❤
I really hate most people in the media. They are arrogant leftist scum. Strahan seems like a good man though. Don't know his politics which means he is doing his job correctly and not like the rest of the leftists. I hope his daughter gets through this
How sad!!! So sorry.😢
Oh this broke my heart for them but also I’m so happy for them for getting such incredible quality treatment! World class father. World class family. Wishing her a full and speedy recovery! 🫶🫶
Way too many people getting cancer and tumors, specifically brain tumors. I have six people in my own life, young and healthy now battling... .Something is not right...

Prayers
Praying for your speedy recovery. God bless.
What a strong & beautiful young lady. Prayers for healing. 🙏💜
She is a beautiful young woman may God bless you and keep your faith in Jesus.
Ant she just beautiful, Isabel your a warrior. Keep fighting and you have a great father,  Michael! You guys are an example of a great supportive family! ❤❤❤❤
💗💗💗💗🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
🙏🏼💕🙏🏼💕🙏🏼💕🙏🏼💕🙏🏼💕🙏🏼
Praying for your daughter and Micheal too. When you stated that we arent giving more than we can handle is frin the Bible.. The one true healer and live. Not the crazy mess some in white evangelical world  used His name. Our broken world and so many people need to see and believe in the one true Jesus. God is love and I have tears thinking how he is giving your daughter steanghth and making a You Tube channel for others like her.. Going thru the same thing. Nothing shows true love Jesus wants for us than that.. Praying
She’s so beautiful I’m praying for her daily ❤️‍🩹
I’m praying for Isabella 🙏
❤❤❤
Michael Strahan you are a great father because with everything your daughter Isabella is going through with her brain cancer you are giving her all of the love and support she needs.  Isabella and your family will be in my thoughts and prayers for healing.  My mom that was my life and world as well a single Mom had to fight breast cancer twice in her life losing the battle at the age of 91 years old.  My Mom endured and went through so much pain and suffering both times that only God or a person having cancer could only understand.  I was where you are now with your beautiful daughter and myself and my family understand what you and your family are experiencing right now.  My advice is keep strong for your daughter, supportive and loving.
I lost a dear friend from leukaemia in Dec 2023. She was 24yrs old. I thought of her while I watched this and it broke me. More life to this young lady. She looks beautiful and optimistic.
She looks so pretty she is beautiful in every way. And I’m not just saying that! I see her. She is Strong she is a conqueror she is  a fighter. His daughter is amazing. She  had a big battle to fight  and she won. I want to be like her! Congratulations 🎈🍾🎉🎊 to her for winning the battle against what is so hard to be victorious in.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Be strong dearest ✊🏿✨️
Dr Seyfried of Boston college please go see🙏🙏🙏
Dr Thomas Seyfried  out of Boston College…..please go see him before you take anymore chemo….he specializes in brain tumors and has found that through minimal therapy survival is very high….
🙏🏾
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Isabella you and your family are in my prayers. You are absolutely beautiful and God loves you so much🙏🏾🩷
TRUST IN Jesus Christ because he is still a Miracle Worker Amen!
I remember on July 5th, 2010( which was my birthday) and I got call late night around 10 or 11pm which was late for me, and I answered the phone and the voice on the other end said it s this Ms Cynthia Kelly, I said yes, and it was a piest or someone that prays for the sick and He  said if you want to see your son alive you better get here( eastern shore Peninsula Hospital)  now. They told me my son Eljay at the age of 27 was dying! I told them I don't believe that report and that I believe the report of the Lord and he shall live and not die and declare the works of the Lord, and today by God's Grace and Mercy my son lives on his own at the age of 40, he may have some struggles but he's living and in his own apartment, God is a Healer in Jesus name, Hallelujah Hallelujah, Glory to GOD 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙏🙏🙏
Thank you for sharing.
That’s super sad, BUT…REAL TALK…When U GOT MONEY…you gon get that Upper Echelon Medical care… Cause, let it be Tyrone with his baby who works at the Waffle House… “Way different ending”!- Trust…😒😒😒
God bless you and your family and I am praying for you and pleading in the blood of Jesus that you are healed ❤️🙏🏽

Isabella, I just watched your YouTube interview with Robin Roberts. Our son was diagonosed with Medullablastoma December 2012 at the age of 22.  Like yourself, he was living the dream prediagonosis.  He was a junior at the University of CO, Boulder.  He had to move back home and missed a year of school.  His treatment was at University Hospital and Children's Hospital in Denver.  January of 2014 he returned back to CU and graduated May 2015.  11 years later, he is living life to the fullest, self employed and owns three businesses in PA.  You will find the oncology doctors and nurses are angels from heaven.  Treatment is a marathon, not a sprint.  Be strong through your journey.  Bless you and your loving family.
My prayers are with you all it going to be alright god got this 🙏🏾💯🫶🏾
I can’t imagine as a parent seeing your child go through that, I couldn’t keep the tears from flowing watching this, praying for strength and Healing for Isabella and the whole Family
God bless you and may his healing power begin expeditiously for complete healing!

She’s beautiful young lady. Let’s hope she continues to get better ❤️‍🩹
Get well Isabella, You can do it! You have an amazing Dad . I only wish my dad was here when I went through my Esophagus cancer six years ago. You have a lot to live for .  I understand that my cancer is not the same

I remeber so well the call I got on a Monday morning the day after her high school graduation that my daughter had a rare aggressive cancer. I was speechless and crushed. I couldn't say a word and the doctor kept asking me if I was alright. Just the worse day for a parent. Good luck fight on. my daughter is still battling since 2011.
Ty so much for sharing. I can feel your emotions. I’m so sorry yall had to go through this. She will have a total recovery. I’m praying for complete healing without any residual effects. My son three years ago was diagnosed with Grade 4 Glioblastoma. Had two brain surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation. I know that he will completely recover from this. He is a truly living testimony. God Bless
Praying for you young lady.

Sorry to here. Please take my foolish advice and get on a Plane and go see Prophet Lovy at Revelation Church in California and it shall be well with thee.  Lift your FAITH above your fears and go. Even if my Jesus means nothing to you please go see His manservant as he will enquire of the Lord concerning thee. Be bless.
The battle has just begin. My  mother battle breast cancer for 25 years. She passed two years ago. Her life has changed for ever.  I will keep her in prayer
Same age my daughter when diagnosed of colon cancer, I know how it feels as a parent and you know how your daughter feels, my prayers for Isabela and to the parents, it will be tougher when chemo starts, stay strong Isabela 🙏 🤗
I have cancer and I’m petrified of it going to the brain. I truly hope she will recover. I am a double organ recipient heart and kidney. I have had cancer twice. This time it’s moved to my lungs. Metastatic Melanoma. Courtesy of the sun. Cancer is everywhere and everyone knows someone with it. I have a few friends with it. I wish them strength and send them my love. I am glad Robin got to do the interview. Lord knows she’s had the experience with what it feels like. Cancer is all around us. My friend and neighbor was just diagnosed with a rare form of ovarian after I told her mine. It’s just so sad.
God bless you! You got this fight 💕
Best wishes to you young Isabella!  You’re a beautiful person.  I’m glad you have a strong support system to help you through all you’re going through, and I think it’s wonderful you’re sharing your journey with others.  God bless!
What a beautiful woman!
Such an intelligent and brave young woman. You can see the relationship between father and daughter. Well done. Great job that Robin didn't even mention her situation but let the focus remain solely on Isabella. Beautiful story all around.
God bless her, she is beautiful, so glad she is doing well, and will continue to heal. 🙏🙏

The Strenght And Courage Is A Inspiration For Us All Who Has To Go Thru The Same Life Experiences With Family Members Or Ones Self If Up Lifting For Me..🙏🏽🙏🏽💜💜
I am 66 years old. I was diagnosed with mine in November of 2023.  Over 30 centimeters. Not cancer.  Had surgery on the 30th.  7 days in the ICU, and then home. They were not able to get it all, so we are now watch and wait. MRIs every three months to monitor, if it changes then radiation.
It’s so important to share because if you are passing through something like a rare illness you feel very alone and it helps a lot to connect with others going through the same difficulties. She is adorable
God Please Bless Her‼️🙏🏾
🙏🙏🙏 what a beautiful attitude and spirit ❤️
I don't feel like a warrior, cancer just happened to me and I didn't die
Lord Have Mercy, My prayers are with them.............Jehovah can DO IT!!!!

Hi Isabella,  I was also diagnosed with a  brain tumor/cancer (ependymoma) at 32 years old on August, 2022. I also completed rehab and 6 weeks of radiation therapy.

We’re a living testimony! I’m so glad you’re doing well. God bless you!

Isabella the Best Is Yet To Be.
My mama heart broke seeing her tears flow. I went through breast cancer at 41 back in 2016 and it was tremendously difficult as an adult. I can say that treatment is not easy and she is going through a lot! What an amazing young lady you are Isabella.. I have a nearly 18 yr old daughter as well and to have her go through this would be devastating. You keep on fighting Isabella.. you are a beautiful blessing and God’s got you ❤
Anyone else who is going through this same situation or similar,I pray for you and keep going. Please don't give up💔God sees you,and he knows. May he continue to keep his hands on your lives.😇Amen
Praying love and light. Isabella will recover miraculously
My Prayers go out to the Strahan family. Isabella,you are going to be alright. Amen
Love and prayers to her and Michael and his family. Yes, Michael is a millionaire but they go through life like us. Praying man.

Blood of Jesus covering every area in Jesus Name Amen Jerh 30;17
I believe that when people openly speak about what they are going through instead of keeping to themselves, they can deal with it better --makes them stronger. Plus, it helps others who may be facing the same thing.  Try to concentrate on the , Now.

Stop eating all sugars and processed foods.  Only organic vegetables. No sugar not even from fruit.  Cancer feeds off of sugar.  She is so young to be going through this.

Hi Michael and Isabella I  Want u guys to know that u are so strong! And God can see u through this" Isabella you are so beautiful and I remember seeing a glimpse of u and ur sister on some interview or show thinking wow Michael kids are so beautiful and I want u to know u still are beautiful and so very brave and what u are doing has so much purpose! U are a definition of a true soldier and u shall live and not die no matter what I hope u find the strength to keep going for u, ur dad and the rest of ur family! 💪🏼  @goodmorningamerica Michael Strahan and Daughter Isabella!
Prayers for total healing and wholeness of your body. And continued strength for you and your family. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

GOD BLESS YOU ALL!❤

Beautiful!❤
Praying for healing for you and your family 😢
Isabella you are beautiful and strong.
I wish I could speak with both Strayhand and his Daughter. I and my family just went through this in May 2023! You got this baby girl l! I'm a living testimony
She is so sweet and kind hearted.  She is so great, I know her dad is so proud of her and I am also.  I don't know how I would have been if that happened to me at her age or right now at my age.  God bless Isabella You are truly blessed. ❤🙏❤
God bless you Isabella!! You are a strong and absolutely beautiful young woman. You are touching so many lives by sharing your story!!!
I hope this EDUCATES & Aid everyone this story reaches. I especially think it's awesome that she is sharing knowledge of what's going with her. Because some young person will remember this one day and not self medicate , or over look going to the Doctor. Brain tumors are so common now it's scary. Folks having stokes in their 30's The thought of losing a child is Horrible and actually living through losing one , just say your life has a new meaning. So I am Proud that Strahan Expressed needing support also. Our Men need room to breathe , to feel process and get a good cry in. REAL MEN THAT CARE DEEPLY FOR OTHERS SHOULD HAVE THE SPACE TO BE OPEN ABOUT HOW THEY REALLY FEEL. Especially when feeling overwhelmed. Caring takes a lot of ones unselfish  energy. Not mention how all in you are as a Parent. So now i have to route for this Beautiful Soul along with my first Cousin #Ivy Joyner PA She's much older and have diabetes that we have to take into account. another sign you guys could learn from. Is my cousin wasn't having horrible head aches as much as one of eyes was losing sight.
Prayers to all going thru any cancer.
Blessings to you all
Praying for her and the family .
I can tell she is soooo scared and I know her dad and family wish they could take all her pain away.  Isabella, keep being you and know now you have millions of prayers and voices to lift you up when you can't do it for yourself.  We love you!
Hey
Prayers for Isabella.
Praying for you Isabella. So thankful for your families love and support ❤️❤️
Oh my God ,what a beautiful  young  strong,lady you are. You have a strong  will to strive and survive. Crying  is a good thing get it all out. When I was watching you on you tube it broke  my heart and tears came  down my face .I will pray for you everyday and your family. Your father is a great support  for  you.  God Bless  You and your family.
10:28  you are so beautiful and amazing & encouraging may God continue to bless you and healed you in every way❤🙏🏾💞🙏🏾💖🙏🏾!!!

God heal and bless you Isabella 🙏🏾
Wow

Alexi Lalas played for Coach Csapo at Rutgers? Did he not spend a stint at the Calcio Seria A team Padua. Is he not familiar with Freddy Rincon, Faustino Asprilla and Carlos Valderrama and Higuita? Lalas was seen playing for USA, Rutgers, and another team in a US soccer league, one populated by European clubs' rejects, retired bound and overweight players lowering the standard of professional soccer play. As a commentator, he is an a self - centered and avowed racist.
Dear Isabella,   Positive energy during chemotherapy can make a significant difference, uplifting spirits and fostering a hopeful mindset that complements the healing process. It helps create a supportive environment, both mentally and emotionally, for individuals facing the challenges of treatment.❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
Hope and pray that Isabella comes out of this mess soon! Bless you dear ❤

Isabella, none of this is a surprise to God.  He placed the exact people you needed in the right place at the right time.  It’s ok to be afraid but know that Jesus Christ has been with you and will be with you as you complete your treatment.  I was diagnosed in 2008 with breast cancer.  Here I am today, thanking God for His love and for healing me.  Every morning I wake, I thank Him.  You will, too. ❤❤❤

My prayers to her and your family. 🙏🙏🙏
She is so beautiful!!!!!
I am so sorry you all have to go through this. My son was diagnosed with cancer 2.5 years ago. He had a rare sarcoma on his inner left thigh. The Tumor was bigger than a foot ball. This past summer he rang the bell, and is cancer free. I thank the doctors at Lurie and his surgeon Dr. Samer Attar at Northwestern, he is a gift from God, he is amazing and he assured me that my son was going to be ok...Look him up he is the best. Chemo is scary but, it was not as bad as I thought it would be.....one thing about my son is that he never let the cancer get in the way of his strength, his power.....you daughter is beautiful...and she will be just fine....
💙🩵💚💛❤️
Hmmm. I wonder if she had the jab? Especially for it to come on suddenly.
Isabella, my son was diagnosed with medullablastoma in 1990 at age 14 1/2. He will celebrate his 49th birthday in May. Be strong. You can do this!!
Sending healing prayers to Isabella 🙏
Isabella our prayers are with you and with ever other parent and child that got a cancer diagnosis prayers are powerful powerful 🙏🏻🙏🏻❤
This breaks my heart  I'm bawling my eyes out. What a beautiful child. I have cancer I prey everyday my children do not get it. Thank you to all you. Isabella I'm praying for you girl. You will do great. Also remember living each day is what u and everyone should do. Thank you
Prays for Isabella and your family.
You're beautiful baby. Don't let anyone tell you different
eres una niña hermosa y una mujer muy fuerte Dios te bendiga🌻🌻
🙏❤
Brave young lady. Prayers prayers prayers 🙏❤️🙏💜🙏
Being told you have cancer is hard, especially when you are alone. I had my tumor removed, and chose a cannabis treatment instead of chemotherapy and radiation treatments, so far I'm still doing well five years later. Put your trust in God and not man, and you can never go wrong.....
Prayers with Isabella🙏🏽🙏🏽

Healing prayers for Isabella! Hugs of love!❤
heartbreaking ... so young .. so beautiful...
I started suffering massive headaches for no reason. Even emergency room ‘headache cocktails’ couldn’t treat the headaches. 2 years later… I have a congenital disease, chiari malformation. Believe it or not my headaches went away after just a few uses of MMJ I know it sounds dumb.. cliche even.. I haven’t even smoked in a year I’m still ok!  But I couldn’t even move my head out of bed. Only thing I wanted was sleep. Sleep was the only reprieve from my pain. I would wake with a few minutes of ‘OKness’..  As women we tolerate pain well. Get it checked. This sweet girl had the same symptoms as me and is probably a better person than me. Could happen to anyone.  Cancer sucks. My grandpa passed from it. Oh and god forbid my symptoms return again. I’d have rather died. Please lord never again 🙏
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
My eyes are watering up.😢
🙏 JESUS ❤❤❤HEALER
The Lord Jesus Christ can heal her. Bible verses are God's medicine for mankind. Let her invite the Lord Jesus into her heart, start a fresh personal re with God, take her Bible and speak the verse on healing aloud every day.  God's word is POWERFUL to heal.  Sending her and all others love.  The Lord Jesus loves you all
God Bless You Isabella just pray and don't cry it's cancer it's out I have different cancer 3 time my doctor give me 2 years to live that's was 14 years ago only God know when it's time to me to go all off us will go on this earth we are visiting real home out there with God don't be afraid just pray you to young my fist cancer I was 34 know I'm 75 year March 19 I will be 76 you see God have plan for me not ready to see him .Just pray and talk to him let know what you want.tell him you not ready to go .God listening believe me. S.A
Prayers going to the Strahan family
❤❤❤ Michael is suck a great guy. Praying for your daughter. Stay strong you are beautiful!!!
What a strong and beautiful young lady!! My prayers are with u and your family!! May God’s bless you!!🙏🙏
Bet she is jabbed. Turbo cancers on the rise
Chemo is going to be no fun but the red and white blood cells get blood transfusion if they go down
Wear w wig of a hat you dont have to be balded
Please don’t give up! It only takes faith the size of a mustard seed!
Everything comes in our lives for some reason….Lord wants to teach us something good we just have to trust in Him… your beautiful daughter is going to be alright she is very young and beautiful she can fight and surely she is going to win she is going to overcome on it…. Remember one thing that God is in control of everything in your life..in my life and every ones lives be strong and put your faith in Him and Him alone….I am going through the same problem but my faith in my Lord Jesus Christ is getting stronger and stronger day by day….I am sure in your life and your family lives too….GOD ALMIGHTY JESUS CHRIST BLESS YOU BABY….
Prayers 🙏 Going up Amen
MAY GOD BE WITH YOU ALL THE WAYCTO THE END OF THIS JOURNEY PROTECTING YOU AS ONLY HE CAN!! ❤️🙏🏻

Wow.. this is crazy….
I love him.  Will be praying for all of you.
Her and her family are in my prayers and I thank her for sharing for others to hear they’re not alone 🙏💐
My prayers go out to Isabella and her family🙏
I can't commend Isabella enough. That was a rough hand she was dealt in life so early on but she is doing her best to spread love and positivity. I will just say, briefly, that she is INCREDIBLY lucky that her father is Michael Strahan. The American healthcare system only benefits the wealthy. This is NOT to minimize her struggle, but just to say it is real and HARD that those less fortunate can only dream of the recovery process she had. Some die while struggling through the same battles due to lack of money
Isabella your beautiful inside and out.  What a strong brave young woman.  You got this sweet lady.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤God will bless you❣
Prayers for Isabella and the family. 🙏🏽
~ THY WILL BE DONE - 🙏🏻MEN. ~

😢😢😢😢
I am so sorry to hear that about your daughter my prayers are with you. I went through the same thing with my son and now hes getting better.😢😢😢🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
My 4 yrs old doctor passed from brain cancer. A same very rare cancer was found at 2 and returned later. I wish I knew somethings the doctors didnt tell me. Have her eat a ton of fruit and veggies. Certain things like onions,ginger,cloves,turmeric etc have been shown to help kill those cells. Processed foods can actually cause cancers(yes bacon is processed). I didnt know about mushrooms like turkey,reishi, chaga,cordyceps or graviola. It made me learn about how to build the body naturally to help kll it. Thats now part of my life.
I’m so sorry for your beautiful daughter having that horrible tumor and just going through this I’m sending prayers and love to her and her family ❤❤❤❤🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Caused by close proximity of Wireless technology!
Praying for total healing
That Beautiful Baby! 🌹❤️🙏🏾
I want to just hold her this is so rare and its scary for her.  My prayers are with her.  Budwig diet might be needed for this type of cancer.  I wonder if Kaytruda, the new medicine, would help her.  It's brand new and works for 16 different cancers.
You are an amazing girl and you have an amazing father! Keep on doing what you’re doing!
❤🙏🏾❤️

Dear Isabella, I know this is a lot for you. I want to acknowledge a wonderful thing that you are doing that is good medicine for all of us when faced with emotionally charged situations. You are staying open to the emotions, and weeping when they come up for you. That is one of the most loving things you can do for yourself and the body you have been with all your life. Most folks want to shut down their emotions and motor through and that choice does not support healing...be strong and express your truth whenever possible. You are loved...ps. do come home to California - we'll keep the Light on for you 💙💚💙
Prayers for Michael and his family.  Met him and his daughter this year at a USC football game. Such a nice guy. God bless.
Prayers Isabella ❤
Blessings for your daughter Mike, hardest to see anyone suffer like this and it hits home here with migraines from a hormone imbalance and stroke.
You are beautiful Izzy❤❤❤❤❤
🙏🏽🙏🏽
I’m so sorry to hear it, but I know that you are persevering and you can only just send love and blessings to the family❤
❤❤❤❤
🙏🏼❤🙌🏽God has You
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 trust GOD  through the  process

Please please please please please do not pass me off as some kind of quack..... I have helped my mother my fiance and at least a dozen other people successfully defeat various kinds of cancer including brain...by utilizing Asian mushrooms, Curcumin, broccogen 10 and other natural products. There's quite a bit of scientific research on mushrooms and curcumin as well as things like ground flax seeds.... in most cases the natural products improve the results of the drug based Therapies but some folks don't tolerate conventional treatments and have to turn to natural alternatives and that's where I came in..... assisting by recommending researched natural products and getting excellent results.  Purica brand Immune 7 is the core product that we've used, their complete 360 is also fantastic. My mother had the cancer that killed Steve Jobs and we were able to put it in complete remission within just over a year with only natural products as they had no treatment for that cancer in conventional medicine.
God bless you with a speedy recovery ❤❤ prayers for you
Our prayers are with you and your beautiful family 🙏🏾Thank God for his healing powers 🙏🏾
Brave young woman. Prayers for her and others for our Lord to heal them.
My cousin had a brain tumor at the age of 16 years old and lost an eye in 1975.  She went on to finish high school, college.  Also got married and had two children.  She transitioned in 2015 from breast cancer.  God gave her 40years, which was longer then they originally gave her.
Praying for her and family and friends during this season and I am so proud of you 😂
My prayers are with Isabella. She is a very strong young woman.
What a strong beautiful young lady. Praying healing and speedy recovery over her.❤️‍🩹🙏🏽🌹
Sending prayers
Blessings, peace and healing to Isabella!
Prayers up
I lost a friend to a brain tumor in 2015 and even today it still hurts.   He was like a little brother to me.  He was always into sports and he was energetic.  I still miss him to this day but I’m amazed at how strong she is.  Stay strong Isabella.
God bless you,  Michael.  I have been watching you on GMA and football games. I love you and praying 🙏 God gives you strength and peace during this difficult time.  Keep praying and God hears prayers. He is our healer. ❤😊
Isabella,  keep your faith in God,  get to know God.  He will heal you and protect you.  Lord, give Isabella strength and peace during this difficult season 🙏.  We are praying for you always. God bless you always.  🙏
Praying for your daughters total healing and your families strength  to keep her fighting.🥰

Praying for baby girl Isabella and may God bless you with long life 🙏 ❤️ and hang in there Strahan family
Prayers
Wish her the best!
Isabella, continue to stay strong, joyful and confident.  I want you to know that this too shall pass.  I have jokingly said that cancer has following me practically all my life. I have been diagnosed and surgically treated for cervical cancer, lung cancer, metastasized brain cancer and including cancer in the lining of my brain. There was even a time that, because of the steroids I was on I looked like something else with very little energy to take care of myself.  I've gone through radiation treatments, chemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments as well. And you know what, I AM SILL HERE!!  Feeling every bit of being grateful and truly blessed.  Because as of the last couple of years it appears that I am cancer free. I pray that God will continue to watch over you and get you through this journey. Also, my inspiration when I was dealing with lung cancer and after was Robin Roberts. So, I am sure she will be there for you if or when you need that boost. I wish you nothing but the best, stay strong, be happy, laugh, cry when you need to (it's okay) and always be positive.
:( My sister passed away 10 months ago from a benign tumor.😢 Last year was so hard becuz it was a host of firsts w/o her. Halloween, Thanksgiving, xmas & New Year Eve :( My thought are with Michael, his daughter & family! 💌

GOD BLESS ISABELLA, & HER FAMILY.
Hi Isabella, I'm so glad you decided to come out and tell your story. Their are people that think nothing is really wrong when they go through agonizing headaches, they just take a pill and think everything is ok as a temporary fix. I suffered with headaches and was passed from one doctor to another, and one day, I finally met the right doctor. I didn't end up having a tumor but I have to take medication every single day to control my headaches. Your story will move others to go and get checked out before it's to late. Ignoring this problem can turn out to be worse than expected, and thank God you when you did!!! Thank you for telling your story.
Thank you. Who would’ve thought we can share our stories to each other and comfort each other all over the world. And not knowing each other. My husband was diagnosed with stage four cancer last year.
Your child and all the children going through cancer are in my prayers🙏🏼
Too bad baby girl. I think you’re gonna be OK though!
Saint Rita will protect you my sweetheart.......l know and feel your pain.....l.have been there,.....never ever give up,.....l will keep you in my heart and prayers ❤❤❤❤❤
You got this sweetie. My God please heal her and stay strong

🙏  Thank You So Much Michael & Isabella Strahan  for sharing to let others with the same health problems know that they're not alone ... Try eating more alkaline foods like vegetables like cabbages , broccoli , beetroots , mushrooms , garlic , onions , fruits like papayas , soursop , lemons , dragon fruits , chia seeds ,  spices like turmeric with black pepper , gingers , natural oils like olive oil , natural butter , coconut oil to substitute highly processed vegetable oils  that can disrupt cells' communications , substitute sugar with pure honey , substitute salt with natural sea-salt ,   stop taking drugs that are harmful , stay away from alcohol & smoking tobacco , get more fresh air , do soft stretching exercises & sleep more ...  Having Enlightened Beings' mantra in one's heart & mind can help the healing processes from the Universe!  🙏🕯🌏🕊
Praying for Isabella and family!
She's a beautiful child in so many ways. God bless her & may he heal her completely. May God bless the family & keep them strong.

At the age of 18 I was diagnosed with stage three Hodgkin’s disease. I’m pretty sure it was hard for my parents to hear that. Because of my chemo and radiation I was lucky to have one child. at the age of 29 I had already gone through menopause. Fast forward 25 years later at the age of 43. I had a heart attack and three months later I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I am now 56 and pretty healthy. Isabella kind of reminds me of myself at such a young age. Everyone always says how can you be so positive when you have such major health issues. I’m not sure why I do but hoping that Isabella stays that way to help herself also.
Keep letting  we know, please. I watch you every single day on ch 16.❤
❤❤❤❤Isabella you are so beautiful and strong
That interview  makes me cry, but iam hoping  on God will help her. May God bless you all❤

Im sorry abt this. She is a mature awesome young woman. She can help a ton of people and young people get over this dx and the depression, anxiety, come to terms with issues, bring fam together...heal old wounds even. But.... in back of my mind is the damn shot. I cant help it. I was all for it at very beginning but after this last yr and many that I know becoming ill out of blue, cancer out of blue, cancer re-emergence out of blue, and all young! Like under 50. Heart issues, clots out of blue...what is going on...wierd auto-immune issues...its fing scary what big pharma can do to us. Sorry if this offends anyone. It was on my heart to say. Prayers to this young woman.

Prayers going out to her🙏🏽💖and her DAD💖
Blessing you and your powerful, healing journey! I see you healed. Btw, last year, this month, my only child, an adult son, was shot 4 times at point blank range by a stranger. The blessings are tremendous. He chose to fight. It has been a long, very challenging journey. I was blessed to fly across the country to be with him and his journey from day one, and I stayed with him for months in the hospitals. Since his release from the hospitals, , we've been roommates. A major part of his body currently experiences paralysis due to spinal cord injury from a bullet lodged in his spine. He, like you, is an AMAZING WARRIOR, especially through this, his greatest challenge! I know his condition continues to improve! I am like your father, I couldn't and can't stop the pain, but I am committed and dedicated to journey with him as his avid team member, caregiver, and Mom.  Since he's grown, I have had to learn how to let him decide what his healing path will be. I learned to suggest, not dictate. In the beginning, I had a larger role because of his condition. What a relief that now he makes his own decisions and I get to be his biggest fan and supporter through every achievement, large and small.  I pray you both full and complete healing, and that the lessons you learn through your processes bless you greatly, grow you beautifully, and help you become your best YOU!💜
May God bless you, and get the family through this. Prayers for you Isabella and family.
cry all you want baby girl, praying for you and your family.one love

God bless you Isabella thank you for sharing your story I wish I could give you a hug. My dear friend was diagnosed with breast cancer by the grace of God it was no stage, six months later she was experiencing a very bad headache she went to the hospital and when they did an MRI they saw that she had a tumor near her brain that had not erupted saved by grace I know a God that sits up high and sits down low, Isabella you are a trooper praying for your recovery.
She’s so beautiful. God bless you honey.
Such a brave young lady.❤ Hugging you in prayers and positive thoughts, all Will be well, Bella💝💝💝💝  If may, try family therapy Constelation. Not really sure o wrote that correctly. A therapy made popular in the West by Bert Hellinger.

Poor baby,I wish her the best.
we’re rooting for you and your family Isabella! ❤️
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼♥️
I saw this interview & I was balling 😢😢😢.I cried for daughter & father.I just want to give words of encouragement to both & say The Lord is a miracle worker & he will heal your baby.He performed a miracle in my life.I had (2) open heart surgeries @ 5 months old & 5 yeats old  at Stanford University by the best heart surgeon in the world (Dr. Shumway & his team).They told my parents to plan for my funeral & the  priest read the last rights to me,however the Lord said otherwise & I've been blessed to live to see my 56th birthday & haven't had any complications.I've learned in life whatever we go through in life, it is our testimony to let everyone know that we have to give all honor,thanks & praise to our Lord.
My cousin had a medulloblastoma at age 13 he's 26 years old turning 27 soon. Never ignore balance issues because usually it's indicative of something a lot worse but the good thing for this young lady is that these tumours are more fatal in young children and the older you are the more likely you are to have a full recovery. Childhood cancerof any sort is the worst. I pray for Ms. Strahan and all the babies out there fighting.
Isabella…you are so strong, kind, and gentle all at the same time. Thank you for sharing your story and your test is and will continue to be your testimony! You have a great and special support system around you and them all combined with your inner strength will see you through this. God’s got you! Prayers for you and a great recovery. 🙏🏽
Good luck sweetheart  we will be praying for you you are so beautiful we love you!
ABBA FATHER, THANK YOU FOR HEALING ISABELLA AND HER ENTIRE FAMILY 🙏🏾MAY SHE AND OTHERS BE HEALED AND A CURE BE FOUND FOR THIS AILMENT, WITH SPEEDY THANKS, IN LORD JESUS MIGHTY NAME, AMEN AND AMEN🙏🏾🔥🕊️🛐♥️
May God be with you Isabella ❤❤❤❤❤❤. Keep fighting and thanks for sharing your story. Lots of love to you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
11:23 Thank You for sharing Michael & Isabella….🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾❤️
God's blessings to you and your family ❤
I was diagnosed with brain cancer Christmas Eve 2004.  All my treatments were done in January-April 2005.  I was given 3-4 years to live. I am still here 20 years later!  Keep positive thoughts,  my Christian world view was sooo helpful.  My treatments included surgery, 33 treatments of radiation and 2 years of oral chemo (5days every month).  Forgive people’s stupidity and stick by people with positive attitudes.  I imagined that my white blood cells with soldiers that specifically went to the tumor killed them!  Psalms in scripture was helpful to me.
Prayers up for your family...for this beautiful young student...who will overcome! Thank you St. Jude! Stay strong as you conquer and overcome the battle!
The  very best to you Isabella. Much Love! God has you in his hands❣️
My niece was treated for leukemia at age 3. She’s now 21, and thriving. 😊I pray your journey is one of complete and swift healing. Praying for you and your family 🙏🏽 ❤

This story has me in tears I feel for her deeply and I am so grateful to god our lord and those that have been part in her medical care. I was diagnosed with esophagus cancer that mets to right adrenal gland and brain had surgery to remove the gland in May 15th 2023 and brain surgery May 30th 2023 and so grateful to still be here living and thriving even though I still have a small tumor in my esophagus I am able to drink & swallow. I half a mild stroke while on the operating room when the brain tumor was removed that caused for my left eye to lose some of my sight but I’m still holding on to my faith in trusting in god that I am constantly healing each day through his grace. My prayers for you beautiful and brave soul may you continue to heal and be prosperous in good health prayers for your love ones as well as this is also hard on those we love. My youngest daughter was 2 years old when she was discharged with stage 2 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma my girl was brave and all that could be done was but the lord decided to call her home 2 weeks before her 8th birthday. Her life birthday is May 19th I was diagnosed May20th I still hurt deeply for this huge loss but god comforts me always. Prayers to everyone who is dealing with an illness May your health be restored soon.
May God watch over you.  🙏🏾  Stay strong and kick this thing butt
God Bless you baby girl.  I will pray for you and your ongoing journey
Isabella may God bless you and hold you in his powerful hand that you will never stray away from him wishing you and your family always the best much love🙏🏾🙏🏾💕🫶🏼 God is good!! All the time!!!

Micheal, " God does not put on us any more than we can bear, " God's got this and her journey in the things of the Lord and thinking of others as well as herself  have only just begun. There is a great work yet to be done, in her and in the earth.

Michael and Isabella,  I understand what you are going through... my son Corey is an adult, and he's much older than Isabella.  In 2021, at the age of 43, he was diagnosed with a rare type of colon cancer. It was stage 4.😢. He is still going through the treatments. He had surgery, and the doctor removed the bad part. He had some spots on his  liver, and a potion of his liver was removed,  which has since grown back.  The treatment was chemo, and now he is on Her2 positive infusion cocktail that he has to take every three weeks. I am telling you both this because you are never too old for mom and dad to step in. I call myself momma bear 🐻. I am with him every step. And Isabella, your dad will be there too. So keep your head up and be strong, and with God's help, you 🙏🏼 will get through this. This, too, shall pass. GOD'S got this, and you will beat this 🙏🏼.  I will continue to lift you up in prayer 🙏🏼 every night.  Michael , my heart ❤️ is broken too, but you know that God's still sits on the throne and is still in the business of healing and curing. So let go and let God. He will cure Isabella and cure my son Corey. My comment is straight from my heart to you both. God 🙌 blessings...prayers to you 🙏🏼.
My heart is with you all. I lost my eldest to GBMO in May 2018 after 6.5 years f fighting. Isabella u r amazing!
I WONDER IF SHE GOT THE JAB FOR SCHOOL? I'VE BEEN MEETING AND READING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO HAVE STAGE FOR CANCER OUT OF NO WHERE AND THEY HAVE HAD THE JAB!!!

"Yes, Im crying.  I feel I dont know what to say. But that Im glad Isabella is surrounded by Love. I kniw her twin sustwr feel everything She's  courageous, sweet, and mature.

My sister passed away from stage 4 breast cancer in 2017, and this put me to tears. Prayers and love to her and her family and friends.
Let’s pray for our children daily and ourselves for health and strength and plead the blood of Jesus Christ on our internal bodies every area and putting on the armor of God daily.
Love her confidence and bravery to talk about it live. Prayers for a speedy recovery.
My son was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma not long after his highschool graduation. That was a very hard time for himself and my family as he had just started college as well. Surgeries to remove the worst of it, and receiving his port was such a tough thing to see him going through. Losing his hair from chemo was just an experience like no other. Very very hard watching him go through it all, but he did and he has been cancer free for 4 years now. My prayers are with Michael, his beautiful daughter, and family. Cancer sucks.
Soooooooooo proud of U 🍓..by the way U are BEAUTIFUL!!🎉🎉🙏🕊️👍🙌
You is so pretty, without hair God bless you sweetie .
She is so lucky she can have surgery . Some have it inside brain inoperable .
Oh no poor baby..sending prayers to her, daddy, and the rest of the family ❤
God give the family all the strength and courage they need. She's such a lovely girl ♥
Praying For Your Recovery Isabella ❤
Being positive is truly the best medicine …love her strength and courage, remember you can have your sad days it’s ok to cry and get right back at the fight
❤
Way to go Michael for being a great father. I am fighting cancer myself and it's not easy. Keep fighting together.❤❤❤
You rock!!!!
God Bless her🙏
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I support me and my wife support St Jude every month
Just read your health story😪❤ GOD HAS TAKEN CARE OF YOU🙏🏼 May the Lord bless you and heal you completely!! You are God's child your testimony is truly a blessing to all❤🙏🏼🙏🏼
I know He is not popular in the world system, and you cannot speak His name on American TV, but I pray the Jesus is evident in your and your Isabella's life, especially right now, while she is going through this river of life. I pray that when she is on the other side of this river, strong and healthy and even more beautiful than she is with that beautiful bald head, that she will give God all the glory for bringing her through this mess that is not of her making and that did not belong to her. Cancer is from the pit of hell and I pray in the name of Jesus Christ that it is cut off at the root of it and destroyed and purged out of Isabella's full body and goes back to hell from whence it came. She is beautiful and strong. God will get her through this, and like your cohost said, she will indeed have a powerful message from this mess. May she include Jesus in her story, as He made her more then an overcomer. Amen. Be blessed.
Crying here. God bless you my dear.
Isabella, you’re very brave. God is with you. Keep taking things one step at a time. 🙏🏻💛🙏🏻
Poor thing! You got this sweetie
😢I'm so sorry 😔. My prayer for you and your family Isabella God be with you. ❤
Did she get the jab?
Trust in the Lord for your healing princess ❤🇯🇲
The comments in this video are hard to express into words. So many,so many people saying I have this my nephew died of that. It unreal,so much pain can ripple through this world and all the souls out there. I have lost,then more loss and it kept me in this hole of my own pain. I can't believe how bad it was for others too. I hope what I learn from this wouldn't be forgotten anytime soon.
Bless her! I wish her speedy recovery and healing!❤

They are the absolute cutest family! And omg I lost my Dad this year and this is just a reminder of the love a father has for a daughter! She is a fighter, she is going to help so many people! 🫶🏼
Isabella,  beautiful beautiful woman.  I found that my breast cancer had metastasized to my bones in June.  What I have learned is this. I can choose how I deal with this situation.  I have chosen to LIVE my life with this diagnosis and not to live my life as if I was dying from this diagnosis.  Prayers to you my young warrior.  I am here right beside you...Let's do this!!!❤
Please please please run as fast as you can and get you some sour sap please sour sap so important it is a fruit that kills cancer like nobody’s business it’s very good but it works like nothing out of this world and doctors will not tell you about it start doing research for natural things you can also make tea out of the leaves and you can do this while you’re going through your treatment also juice green leafy things that make you feel better I pray that your outcome will be tremendous

God bless your family Mr. Strahan.

Michael please be strong for her. You are the best father i ever.❤
What's with the pink lipstick on him
Daddy Strahan is a soldier.
God bless you Isabella!!! I’m so proud of you and your dad for sharing and allowing us in to support you all during this time! You will be great! I already see it! ❤ Michael, your journey man!

I am proud of you telling your story baby girl continue to remain strong cancer journey is a hard journey  I myself is on that journey 4 years  Keep pushing keep fighting 💪
So many emotions: Robin trying to hold hers, I would certainly say, thinking of her own experience from breast cancer; Having watched her coworker’s daughter grow up; Obviously, Isabella learning how strong she actually is now; Michael having to be strong for her; cancer having touched seven members of my family and thankfully two are survivors and my brother who’s two years older than I am is fighting!!! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 Having 3 surgeries myself and learning how weak you can get and how strong you are at the same time. 👎🏽👍🏽
Praying and praising God for a full recovery

A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL! My sister had a rare form of cancer diagnosed as a teenager.. She later developed a lump on her head too. It was strange. I remember my parents making trips to the MAYO clinic for chemo treatments. It was a short lived thing. She had her head shaved etc.and wore a wig. It never returned. She is now 55 years old, married her college sweetheart, a grandmother of four children and works as a nurse. She did not only SURVIVE this phase in her life.. She THRIVED!! It was like this NEVER even happened and no one ever talked about it either as if it didn't happen! I THINK ISABELLA will be a grandma one day too! Jeremiah 29:11 God has good plans for you and not evil!
May God bless you and heal you.
What an amazing dad his love and support for his daughter it's out of this world I am touched.
So proud of you all - GOD will bring you through xx❤
Prayers🙏🏻
God bless you Isabella.  Your story and strength inspire us all.  An amazing young lady.
Stay positive Isabella! I have been a 21-year brain -tumor/cancer survivor. Still going strong. Surround yourself with positive people who support your journey. You are a Brain Tumor Warrior.  My prayers will be with you and your family.
When my son was 11, he was diagnosed with Lymphoblastic Leukemia. He wanted to give up so many times. He had one complication after another. Together, we fought for 6 years of treatments, and I am thrilled to say, WE WON!. He is now 38, married, and has two beautiful daughters. It was a long, tiring fight, but I wasn't giving up and wasn't going to let him. Isabella, keep fighting. Look forward to your big, beautiful future and hearing the words "you're  cured." My prayers are going up for you. ❤🙏
Young Lady! You are a Huge Inspiration and Very very Special Person! Your Amazing Attitude and Grace is Undeniable…. I know you will “ Tackle “ this & Wish you a Speedy Recovery ❤️‍🩹

God’s blessings for this amazing and beautiful young lady.  ❤️
I feel very sorry for all of these ppl .  But, why all this new cancer in young people? Can they see any reason? Might want to look into the vax. The truth is out there.  If I was a parent of one of these poor souls . I would want answers even if it goes against the ppl I believed.
Prayers to you 🙏  keep your faith
Praying for healing 🤍
Keep trusting, believing and getting up with a positive attitude knowing you are making it❤🙏🏽🙌🏽
Wow, would never expect this to happen to such a beautiful young girl. I've always liked his daughters, seem like such well turned out young women.  Just goes to show no matter how much fame, privilege and money you have, life can have unexpected turns which make everything else seem insignificant.  Love is what truly sustains us.

Mike i remember like it was yesterday My son also was in 1st year of college😢unlike isabella he was home for winter break and complaining of headaches just like you Mike I didn't think much of it he's very athletic kid played basketball everyday  however my mom called me when I was at work and told me that he did not get out the bed and I knew then that I had to leave work go home and Rush him to a hospital thank God that my best friend his godmother worked for Hachette magazines so she hooked us up with one of the top neurologists un USa he immediately sent me to three hospitals that day NYU Columbia Presbyterian in Sloan Kettering long story short he was 19 then with two large b-cell tumors on the brain We literally moved into NYU it was the hardest thing that I ever went through and I'm sure for him as well  Isabella and Mike I want you to know that today my son is 44 years old and just left my house with his son and we were told he was never have kids after that chemo Isabella don't listen to them doctors when they say something negative you just pray to God 😢 by the way it was NYU Hospital that saved his life
God bless isabella! Very strong young lady ❤ children are stronger than we think ❤
My daughter was born at Duke (my choice) because of a birth defect. I can’t explain to you how incredible they are. She was born with small and large intestines on the outside. I “wouldn’t” be able to hold her for 2-4 weeks. I held her on day 2.  She “wouldn’t” go home for at least 3 months”. Discharged at 17 days. I call a lot of that prayer, which includes God guiding the hands that care for my child. Years later, a mass was found in her tummy by our local ER. Sent straight to Duke for surgery in less than 24 hours and the already had a cancer team ready for her. She had a 13% chance of it not being cancer. Two days after biopsy- we get the news that it’s benign. To give your very first child to a doctor and let go of control, it’s terrifying. But in times of urgency with my family, Duke is where we put our trust. And they’ve never steered us wrong. My daughter is 15 and healthy as can be. The only proof of her battle is what we call her “million dollar belly button”…pretty close to her final bill. lol. And she wears it like a badge of honor…as she should. ❤  I lost a brother to leukemia as well. Lots of radiation and chemo. I have so much empathy and understanding of the harshness. But, God will pull you through. My brother walked by deaths door 5 times, but battled his way past it. Just have the heart of a lion and the spirit of goddess who can’t be defeated. Mind of matter baby girl. ❤
My little cousin (my 1st cousin’s son) had glioblastoma, a brain cancer which was discovered at age 5. He, too, was getting fever and headaches when they found out. He has had 2 surgeries, but unfortunately it came back again. They had already warned his mother of the possibilities of what could happen if he had another surgery, so she left it up to God after that. She didn’t want them to chance a third surgery. Unfortunately, he passed away at the age of 20 years old, one month shy of his 21st birthday, December 26th. He passed away in November of 2014, a few days before Thanksgiving. By the grace of God he lived about another 10 years, after getting that news again that third time that it has come back. The doctors didn’t think that he’d make it as long as he did, because when his cancer came back it grew VERY close to a nerve stem. It would have been possibly fatal to remove. They came up with a method that would be careful as possible, but his mother refused to chance it and let God have it. In the end, she decided not to go through with that third surgery, but his mother faith in God was greater than their prognosis. God gave us 10 more years with him. He would have been 31 years old, December 26,2023. Some might say “but he was still so young,” but we are just grateful that we had almost 10 more years with him. God gave us more time with him—We were able to see him graduate high school and live life a little. 🥺We even took him on a few vacations…..wheelchair and all.😂We celebrate him almost every year around Christmas (his birthday is December 26th), and we are still grateful for the little time that we got. Yeah, he has died young and I wish that could have lived out his youth….his life for that matter, but we don’t control death. I can only be grateful for the time that we were given with him. We were given to opportunity to see him accomplish a few life goals, and that warms my heart every day, so his mother and is—Her family—We are all grateful. ❤
What a warrior!  I love the relationship between this beautiful young woman and her Dad.
Girl you got this we have your back 😢 the worse is behind you stay well ❤

Prayers go out to Michael Strahan and Isabella for a quick recovery. As a cancer survivor myself, I went through the obstacles for me to survive and it may be tough, but if I can do this, you can and will too. Continue to fight the good fight and I wish you a wonderful recovery. #CancerStrong
Fortunately, as a 68 year old man, I have no such story of my own. But, I must say that I believe Isabella is a beautiful, courageous, and awesome person to face the situation and to share it with the whole world. I will be anxiously waiting to see the great things she will offer the world in her future 💖. What an amazing family she has supporting her. I pray for the best for her, and believe that my prayers are taken by The Physician of Physicians who never fails and cannot fail. Isabella has just given me one more reason to add to the list of why have admired and respected her father, Michael. What a woman her mother must be also.  I just totally fell in love with her and her amazing family.
May God guide her safely thru her journey ❤

Daydreams & Diaries: Taylor’s Time by Taylor Black.
God bless
God bless
So sorry to read about Isabella.  My daughter Taylor Black was treated for a brain tumor at Duke under Doctor Henry Friedman.  She kept a diary of her treatment which was turned into a memoir which has been read by many young cancer patients. Isabella might relate to it. Treatment has improved since Taylor’s time.
My heart goes out to Isabella🙏✝️
I pray for your complete healing beautiful young lady.❤
Wow she so strong  I pray God give her  health  and strength abundantly 🙏🙏❤

My thoughts and prayers with you isabella you’re  strong and courageous  with god all things are possible
🙏🏾🙏🏾
Sharing your story to help others and bring awareness. Wishing you a speedy recovery Isabella.
Please be aware not every family is supportive when a child is critically ill. I had brain surgery when I was 38 to remove an AVM- a blood vessel disorder with bleeding causing grand mal seizures. I waited 24 yrs since diagnosis to have brain surgery because my family shunned me. I finally had the guts & insurance to have surgery with NO family there or afterwards. Everyone deserves support & love but it’s not always available.
Robin is such a beautiful soul. His daughter is so stunning. Sending you hugs 🤗 and I know you can pull thru this. You and your wife raised such smart, classy, inspirational children with huge hearts 🥰 💕 ❤. No matter what the end brings Always know you have gave her the very best care.
She’s beautiful ❤
Praying her healing. Everybody going thru something.
This is so hard to watch. My tears is not sad tears they are happy tears cuz this little girl is so strong.
What a beautiful girl❤ she’s so strong keep fighting ❤
Sending love and prayers
♥️🙏♥️🙏
I just went through the same exact thing in 2020. Oddly enough I was 30 (now 34) so it’s even rarer someone my age got Medulloblastoma since it’s mainly kids. I did the brain surgery, the proton and the chemo and I was just upgraded to brain scans every year and spine scans every 2 years instead of every 6 months for both. I dont know if you’ll see this but if you ever needed to talk about it with someone on the other side of it I’m here.
This is heartbreaking I can’t stop the tears I’m praying for your baby girl and the whole family ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Stay strong!!!! Bless you all
My newest hero❤❤❤❤❤
I’m crying,sending them so much love. ❤❤❤
She is crushing cancer! Continued prayers!
Prayer s go out to all the children that have cancer ❤ God is great. Keep your faith strong .Amen

This makes me cry. I’m a 15 year breast cancer survivor… before you know it, Isabella will be saying that she it’s a 15…20…30… survivor.  I’m praying for her and the family right now.
This was so painful to watch, with tears just rolling from my eyes but,  at the end all I could say is,  “to God be the Glory”. I pray Isabella will continue her healing and selfless approach.  This id humbling.  More power to you Isabella you are amazing. Thank God for your parents sibling and friends who continue to rally around you and keep you encouraged.  Praying for your continued strength and healing 🙏🏾.  You’ve got this!!

I know how he feels and his whole family is feeling 2016 my husband had cancer. He had a tumor on his throat about the size of a golf ball as well. He had to have emergency surgery because the tumor starts to spread he went into surgery got everything removed went through radiation. That was a tough year for me and my family but he made it through the only downsize my camera situation was that it he cannot speak. He have to use a larynx machine to talk with but we are so grateful that he’s here with us but as of a few weeks ago we got a call from his doctor  saying they found cancer cells and his prostate and I said to myself here we go again but after talking with the doctors, this is nothing like he went through and we’re going to go with the radiation to take care of this cancer sucks my prayers go out to his daughter.
God bless you Isabella. May the lord cover you with his precious blood and heal you.
U look just like you're DAD 😍

Prayers for continued healing.  You are a strong beautiful young lady you got this. Cancer sucks.  Prayers for Michael and family strength for the fighting support of your daughter.
As a grandparent, with my grandson, Grant having been diagnosed with Medulloblastoma at the age of 7, he has now been cancer free for 10 years. My heart goes out to all that has to battle this horrible disease.
Blessings, Healing lots of Love to Isabella and the Strahan family.❤❤❤
Glad that she was able to see things in a positive light. It’s great that she’s able to go through with the doctors that have helped them out.
Michael, I understand what you are going through with your daughter.  My great-grandson was diagnosed with cancer 10 days after his first birthday.  He was given a 20% chance of survival with chemotherapy.  His medical team refer to him as the miracle baby because none of them believed he would survive.  He is now 4 years old.  Next year, when his scans come back clean, he will no longer have to go through being sedated to have 3 days of scans.  He will be done!!  He will be a cancer survivor!!  He still has issues to deal with.  Such as the foods that he eats don’t taste the same as they do to you and me.  The majority of foods he doesn’t like.  However,  he is starting to try and like more foods now than he did even a year ago.  Especially if he helped make it!  His doctors told his mom that it would take 5 years for his taste buds to get back to normal.  Before his food would taste “good” to him.  One of the side effects of his chemotherapy is autism.  He is showing symptoms of autism.  They are minor symptoms. Things that won’t affect his adult life.  There is still the question whether he will be able to have children.  Because of his being so young, the doctors aren’t sure if he will be sterile.  It’s going to be a wait and see thing.
Get well soon Isabella S. ❤❤❤❤
God bless you Isabella!! My prayers are with you and your family. I admire your bravery and your courage ❤
She will be on my prayers!!!

Mr Michael, I have been watching you for years, and many  can agree with me that you are a good father. I pray for you from the bottom of my heart.

You look amazingly beautiful.   Know that God is with you and God loves you.  What is appreciated is that God has given doctors the hands to heal, so I’m glad that God has sent your daughter to help remove your tumor so you can be healed.    You have a story, and may God use it so you can be a vessel to help others heal too.    Rest assured you’ll be able to attend school again, and you’ll be even more stronger than ever before.
God bless you

My father is battling colon cancer right now and will have surgery at the end of this month. Michael Strahan’s comment of not being as strong as you think you are when everyone expects it is something I’ve dealt with too. It takes a village to help that one person you love. My prayers go to Isabella and the Strahan family. 🥺
I was praying for you and your family before I knew what was going on and I’ll continue to pray now that I know exactly what I’m praying for! Blessings to you all! 🙌🏽❤️🙌🏽
I will keep her in my prayers, as well as her family and love ones🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Praying for Isabella 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽😊

Prayers for her quick  recovery❤❤❤
Praying for you guys! You got this ❤️
I know there was not one parent that watched this video that did not get tears in their eyes. You can have all types of wealth but if you do not have your health it does not matter. Cancer is a horrible disease and yet there are so many advances being made in various conditions. I pray for everyone fighting the fight, whether you are the patient or a loved one of a patient. I pray for complete healing and I pray for the doctors and nurses and every person involved in this battle, that you might feel the power of our Lord, may you feel His strength when you become weary and may you feel comfort when there becomes a need. May we all remember to call upon our Lord in our hour of need always remembering his promise to never forsake us and always remembering His unconditional love. Be kind to one another as we never know the burdens of one’s heart. ❤
I am praying for you to have a marvelous healing from God. You are so beautiful sweet girl.
We're praying  for you  girl, 🙏 it shall come to pass 🙏 🙏🙏
I pray for healing for Michael's daughter in Jesus holy name !!! God bless the Strahan family.

My nephew, on a fluke, at 5 months was diagnosed with an aggressive Meduloblastoma 21 years ago. Spent his life at St. Jude’s until he passed away at 13 months old. They’ve come so far and I’m cheering you on Sofia. You got this ❤

Never give up hope Isabella, I am a cancer survivor just recently in remission, and I am not going to give up living.

There is always hope and have faith in a higher power that can help you get through this and come out triumphant.

Isabel peace be with you sweetie, know that God is with you, just like he’s been with me. I had a pituitary tumor  brain surgery in 2006.   Even though in the doctor eyes the surgery was a success, somewhere down the line an Aneurysm developed & have been carrying since then up to this point.  God has been keeping me.  They wanted to coil it, but I wouldn’t let them, I kept my faith in God, & until this day it is still the same size 2 cm.  Keep the faith❣️You’re in my 🙏🏽🙏🏽💜😇 C. Cooks
❤❤❤ May heal you Isabella! Dad stay strong. She needs you more than ever.
She’s amazing! I’m praying for her complete recovery so she can continue to help others. IJN Amen She’s so strong and thanks for sharing with us! I’m in tears over here seeing her opening up.
Praying for Isabella. Her sister's advice to live her life is the best course of action. Every family in America is enduring some type of storm, and people are on different health survivor journeys.
My sister was diagnosed with Glioblastoma October 2018. She passed away December 2018. It was very aggressive and further along than we knew (stage 4). I’m glad that this young lady is persevering and that it was found in time. Cancer sucks!
What hits me is we are all just people. No matter how succesful or wealthy, how poor and ordinary, we are all people who are vulnerable to hideous cancer. God bless them and all of us.
Praying for you're family💫💕 She is so sweet. You're going to be ok young lady.
Love & light to the Strahan family 💞✨💕
I’m praying for her and the entire family. I went through chemotherapy and radiation and it’s not easy at all and it’s a lot of pain but she will make it through as I did 🙏🏼♥️
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Love you thank you for sharing, you r so brave God bless you all. ❤️
I pray God gives her total healing in Jesus name❤
May God keep his arms around you. Thank you for sharing. Praying for you, that God continue to give you the strength and he will. Much love to you and your family.

Isabella, I feel you. As a 12 year stage 4 Ovarian Cancer survivor I am so proud of you for telling your  story. No child should have to suffer from cancer. I listened to your story and I cried the entire time. The way your dad supports you and the strength that you have is remarkable. You need a support system when dealing with cancer. It’s God’s plan but I know you will beat this. I am praying for you and your family. Like your dad said, you will crush this and move on with your life. 🙏🏽

I had a brain tumor removal surgery in Dec 2018 at age 43. Luckily it was benign. Unfortunately I had a stroke because of it. Even though I survived I need a walker for life and have been on my bed since 2020 because I have chronic dizziness due to the stroke. I really hope she gets well.

I have brain cancer and had surgery in May and this is the first time I’ve heard someone talk about this so candidly, thank you it meant more than I can express 😢
Stay strong
Prayers up.
Blessings and a speedy recovery. 😊
I'm impressed by Isabella. She was expressive and vulnerable. The father on the other hand was not. He seemed to want to "be strong" and "say the right thing"....not so authentic.  I'd have been gushing tears and holding my girl.
Wow u r going to be allrite girl I'm praying for u god bless
BLESSINGS 🙏🏽 🙏🏽❤️
God bless you Isabella and Michael.❤

Prayers to Strahan, his daughter, and speedy healing to her.❤❤
isabella, i am sending you white healing light!! I am a breast cancer survivor. Had breast cancer at age 26 and Im 50 yrs old now!! It was so scary at the time and I can see you feeling that as well. Rightfully so. When I got the diagnosis, I was spinning...  I asked the universe "what are you trying to teach me?" and the answers flooded in & what I received changed my viewpoint. My breast cancer experience turned out to be the best thing that happened to me!! why? It taught me very quickly whats important and whats not in life!! and at an early age!!!!. Im grateful it happened to me young because I had the rest of my life to enjoy the lessons! I often say what good would it have done if I got breast cancer at age 80 and died at age 83 and not be able to change anything! At least I can enjoy the life lessons for 60 yrs and after this experience I changed everything in my life!  Right now, your in it.!!. some days will be good, some days will be low...feel it all.. ups & downs.. surround yourself with positive friends & family...so some great advice I got at the time ... and it helped me was... 1) dont think about whats going to happen in the future.. thats too overwhelming...just think about today only. Live in the moment 2) you mentioned .. you get upset when you think of "what you cant do"... replace those thoughts with what you want to happen....how you want to feel, what you want to be able to do when this is all over.. get excited! 3) finally have a goal... so when you feel low... you know you are working towards something.... like when this is all over ..for ex...."I want to go on a vacation with family to ...???" Good luck, feel it, write it in a journal... (20 yrs from now, you can show your babies how you were feeling and how you got thru it)... Big hug from NY. Vivian :)
Healing prayers, love hugs and prayers sent to all of you. I agree with Robin, you are rocking that doo.❤❤

May God hold you in his loving arms and wash you in the blood of Jesus Christ and make whole .

Be strong 💫💪 Bella get well soon
God bless you 🙏🙏❤️✝️
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Difficult to watch. ❤️
She’s beautiful. Praying for her recovery
I pray she heals fully but it doesn't always end that way. My best friends 12 year old daughter had a brain tumor and she went through it all jist for it to come back and she passed away at 12 so you never know the ending live your life to the fullest ❤
I am beyond grateful her Dr took her seriously. My Dr as a kid decided my migraines were just me faking it. I am happy that I didn’t have anything worse but it took decades for me to talk to another Dr about it and go to a neurologist who immediately did an MRI that showed damage to my brain from not managing the migraines. I demanded my daughter who also has migraines get a MRI immediately so we have a baseline and we got her preventative treatment but what I have noticed in support groups many Drs don’t take patients with intense migraines/headaches seriously.
May God continue to bless you and keep you !
Google UTEP
You got this Isabella!!!!
Wishing Isabella all the best. Keep smiling!❤❤❤ Stay strong family.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
She's beautiful 💕 God Bless her and her family.
Power of Christ be upon you. Fear not sweet child of The Lord Jesus Christ. Thru the trial you are a shining voice. You were not created for this world but to glorify Gods kingdom in the next. Shalom.....The world will be impacted by your testimony
All glory to God!
God got you and your daughter and your family❤❤❤❤
Yo tedeseo Que Dios te cuide i estás en mis oraciones bendiciones para ti y tu familia y amén ❤❤❤❤
I am sobbing. I know the feeling of a rare and dangerous diagnosis personally… this sent me back, but I pray that this young lady overcomes this quickly!

God bless you and your family. Prayers for you and your daughter.
God is Good
May God bless and protect her and all her family 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Uhh 😢I hate this disease when enough going to be enough? When are we going to find cure for all cancers 😢😢😢😢 I’m praying for them for full recovery ❤
Oh Year. Not every female can make Bald look so awesome. On a more serious note, turn to wholesome Organic foods. Exercise. Don't allow Stress to take hold (it's a killer). Know that long term use of many Pharmaceutical Drugs can cause Cancer. My Mom was diagnosed with aggressive B Cell Non Hodgkin Lymphoma at 84 years Old. And while she did do Chemo, we made extreme changes in her Diet, and I stopped all the Medication she was using at the time. She is 93 years old today. Remember that Cancer feeds on Sugar. Remember that Food is Medicine (the right ones). Stay Beautiful. You Can Do This!!
😭🙏🏾
The "right" doctor because she was misdiagnosed for a long time. This is an issue because early detection saves lives...
God bless Isebella Strahan keep your hands on her ❤
God Bless your daughter .and you
Such a beautiful soul!!
PRAYERS FOR HIS DAUGHTER 🙏🙏🙏😢❤
Prayers for your healing.  🙏🙏🙏🙏😢💔💒❤😇🙏🙏🙏🙏 John 3:16-18, Romans 12, Proverbs 3:5-7, John 12-17, Philippians 4:4-8, and Psalms 27 and 84.
Sending healing prayers
God bless you dad . Stay strong. You have an amazing daughter.
God bless you all.  You are so brave. ❤❤
What people don’t realize is that bad cancer, if it doesn’t kill one, leaves one with PTSD and a greater appreciation of the gift of life. Long term remission taps down the PTSD, but it quickly resurfaces with future triggers occur…such as the possibility of cancer based on symptoms that occur (even when unrelated to the prior cancer) …or the return of the cancer again. Without going into details, I speak from experience.
Im so happy for her and she will be in our prayers for a great journey of recovery
🙏🏾🌹🫶🏾😢GOD WILL HEAL YOU AND HE'S ABLE. BELIEVE PLEASE BELIEVE, BECAUSE YOU'RE HIS CHILD AND HE LOVES YOU BEAUTIFUL
Wow God bless the Strahan's Isabella thanks for sharing with us your story of survival.

Isabella, first off, *YOU GO GIRL!!!* I’m so very proud of you! Know that I am praying for you and your family, and sending you all the love in the world! 🩷 God has you, Isabella. He always will! Please, please keep sharing your journey! Don’t push yourself; go at your own pace. I liked Robin’s saying “Making your message out of a mess” -YES! AMEN! You’ll never know how many you have touched and WILL touch! You’ll undoubtedly will save lives. Early detection of any condition is vital! I am a Cancer Survivor, as well as a North Carolina Native! Go UNC, BUT Duke is GREAT! I had to take my daughter (then younger and in Pediatrics) and they are wonderful. Keep fighting! We also need you here! My love and thoughts are with you throughout these very trying times. To Michael, a huge hug, because I know when it’s your Baby, the world just stops. Keep being her rock! 🩷💕🩷💕🩷💕🩷

Praying for a speedy recovery. ❤🙏🏽
Oh Beautiful Isabella. Crying 😢 from your interview. My father in law has brain cancer also . Has had two surgeries. One tumor size of yours & most recent one size of a fist removed. He’s had radiation & chemotherapy. Sadly it’s metastasized in the brain. Now he’s with a shunt in the brain to drain liquid. He’s in comfort stage . Thank God he’s had no pain. Had the headaches , dizziness and strange walking just like you sweetheart. Had aggressive radiation as well. As we know, chemotherapy helps some things but damages many others in the body. May Jehovah God guide you through this to the best way possible . If you read this, please please, tell your dad , hang in there & take it ❤ONE DAY AT A TIME ❤ Much prayers, from Miami,FL
Wow this is extremely sad. She's very beautiful.  Wish her a full recovery
FLCCC -Alliance  has a lot on cancer.  It's a group on-line.

God is strong u can make this and my family member Bien threw that and she had cancer at age 3 and age 11 and she beat it ❤❤❤❤ prayers to you
I’m praying for her healing ❤️‍🩹
I was told I had colon cancer & it metastasized in my liver I had Stage 4 cancer in April of 2023 . I started chemotherapy in May for 6 months 2 times a month, and with chemotherapy had side effects. Through this people we’re praying 🙏 for me every day including myself was praying and trusting God to protect me and heal me from this cancer. In November 2023 my oncologist told me I could have surgery so we scheduled it on December 19 2023 . Continuing to pray and trust God not knowing what my out come would be , after a few days from my surgery , my surgeon came to my hospital room to tell me the outcome on how much cancer tumors he was able to get out . As I comment on this tears me up , because we have a powerful God that loves us and everyone and my surgeon told me he got everything out the liver tumor & colon tumor and it look clean I’m recovering at home my 3rd week since my surgery. This is the God when we trust him and put our faith in God he hears . My surgeon told me I’m cancer free he got everything out . December 19 2023 is my Miracle  Christmas 🎄 Gift from God . I hope my cancer journey will give someone hope that when u put your trust in God anything is possible with him Amen 🙏
I’m praying for her and the family 🤗🤗🤗
Continue to be strong.  Believe in the power of your body healing itself.  I am a 23 year Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma (Cancer) survivor!!  The Cleveland Clinic saved my life.  You are a Survivor too!! ❤️🙏

Isabella, you are so great. Please look at your eating regime. I’m a CA survivor. After being told I had Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma stage 3. And that it’s a boomerang CA - it will come back. I changed my lifestyle & went plant based & stoped everything with refined sugar. May God continue giving you strength from day to day. ❤

You have to continue living your life to the best of your ability.  You also have cute freckles!  I hope you live a long and joyful life and bring your beautiful smile to all the people as you travel through life.  Tears are a way to release stress from your body.  They are good for your emotional well being.  Thank you for being strong and being a mentor to others who are going through the same thing as you.  God bless you!

Exact same story here in our family. Our 8th child, our 11 yr old son, was diagnosed with Medulloblastoma. He’s 29 now. I’m in tears 😭 YOU GO GO GO, sweet Isabella ❤ rooting for you over here in Japan 🇯🇵, way across the ocean!!
Good luck young lady😃
Courage baby, our Heavenly Father will see you through this process

I wish you and your family all the best in this journey. May she heal fast
God bless her and all the fighters out there
Isabella, so proud of your strength!    When I was diagnosed with stage 4 small cell carcinoma that had metasticized to my brain, I decided I was not going to look at prognosis or typical outcomes.    It was my cancer, and I would handle it.  I had radiation therapy to rid over 20 tumors in my brain, received chemo & still get immunotherapy going into the second year of remission.  Thankful for advances in modern medicine.   My prayers and support are with you every step of the way.
😢
Cancer doesn’t care how rich you are, if you’re black or white, slim or a little heavier, young, or older, we all can get it we have to find a cure.
🙏🏽
Nice God bless

A beautiful soul ❤ a Godsend
So sorry to hear this - sending Isabella a big virtual hug and lots of love - you can clearly see there is a whole lot of love from Michael and the rest of Isabella's family and friends...also from the GM team - you can tell they all really care for each other.....get well soon Isabella 💞🙏📿💌
God bless this family. And yes she sure is beautiful
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 God bless
I had brain tumor operation in 2015, was not cancer but left my face and right side with palsy’s, I understand having to walk again and I’m sorry for your pain and I hope you feel better soon!
Michael Strahan,  you are the greatest person and father to your family
What a beautiful courageous wonderful lady! Bless her, bless her, bless her! I wish her every blessing on earth!
Pfizer......
I am going to stop this at one 1 minute and 32 seconds. This should be private family matters why is this even being talked about on TV?
Praying  for your fast recovery 🙏❤
Praying for Isabella I am so happy she was strong enough to tell her story. She is also courageous to give back. So many women go through their illness and treatment alone so happy she is not so her community will grow.  Isabella you are going to make it. Micheal praying for your strength ass well. God Bless💜
May God protect and heal Isabella during her treatments for cancer, build her faith in You, and strengthen her family’s bond, as they support her.  I pray the same for families worldwide that are going through similar experiences.  Lord, we need your Spirit to move quickly to heal mankind of cancer, plagues and diseases, and to heal our land.  Treatment should be available to those who need it, without worry of the cost.  I wish Isabella peace, light, love and blessings from Jesus.  Amen.
Trust i the Lord Jesus Christ. He heals body and soul.
No link to her channel anywhere? 🤷🏾‍♂️
Good Bless Isabella and her family —wishing and praying for Isabella a speedy recovery and a Happy and Healthy New Year 🫠♥️💫😗🌬🫶🫧🫧
God bless her and heal her in Jesus name amen 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Michael I wish your daughter the best recovery! Love you guys!
🙏🙏🙏❤️
God bless you, love from Australia ❤❤❤❤
Not one word about OUR LORD the creator of Life GOD ALMIGHTY, or about your request for a miracle by our one and only LORD and SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST, However you do go on and on about the doctors. And your daughters several friends and family members which are of this world. Wherein the HOLY BIBLE reveals that we once knew JESUS CHRIST in the flesh but because  JESUS CHRIST is no longer with us in the flesh.  Wherefore  no longer do we know man in the flesh.  Wherefore  your obvious failure to seek a glorious miracle of healing from our LORD GOD ALMIGHTY with any such requests by your daughter herself. And or a sought after miracle that your daughter be healed by OUR LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, the creator of Heaven and Earth that including the sole creator of every man and beast that ever traversed upon the Earth whereby in your interview you clearly reveal that your faith is in your daughters Doctor's and within your daughters friends and family members which is unequivocally wrong moreso when it is exclusively GOD ALMIGHTY OUR Heavenly father who manifests all miraculous power that including by the hands of  JESUS CHRIST wherein only GOD ALMIGHTY and JESUS CHRIST can instantaneously heal your daughter with a divine  power that is not on the same level with the manifestations of the power of this world, wherein the HOLY BIBLE reveals that without our LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, and without JESUS CHRIST, that no life would have ever occurred on planet Earth, wherefore if you do not seek the gift of life on bended knees to OUR LORD GOD ALMIGHTY And to our LORD and SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST that your daughter will not live to see her next birthday if you do not turn to your bended knees and seek a miracle of the one and only GOD ALMIGHTY, the LORD the giver of life, and that by OUR LORD and SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST, grant your daughter a miracle in the form of a gift of life by way of the HOLY SPIRIT and they all said AMEN.

Isabella, I will pray for your recovery and complete healing!  You are beautiful and strong and will beat this.
Sadly we are seeing more and more cancers in younger people these last 3 years.
Do they advise her to steer away from majeup with chemicals and any lotions, deodorants etc with chemicals.  Several prominent people after cancer stopped using all chemical products on their body!!!   Not sure about Raw diets that some believe in .  Raw  healthy fruits and vegetables seem to prevent this and lack of  sugars 🙏🏾🙏🏼🙏
What a brave beautiful awesome young lady💚💖💚💖💚💖
wish your daughter all the good health in the world Attitude has a lot to do with everything ❤
Is she one of the twins❓❗If so, if they are identical twins , please check her too because it could be latent WHICH WE HOPE IT IS NOT THE CASE!!!
Isabella, you have a beautiful soul! Keep shining sweet heart! Your blessings will be bountiful.
My heart goes to you and your family ❤ so sorry this happened you! You are beautiful and have beautiful heart ❤
Godspeed young lady. Godspeed. ❤❤❤
My son had that same type of tumor but his was caught before he started showing symptoms. He will be 5 years cancer free next week. Praying for you and your family. ❤❤❤❤
What a strong young woman. I hope and wish her the best. Keep fighting! God bless everyone who is battling cancer, you are all strong beings and you got this! No parent should ever get a call or experience their children fight cancer.
❤ What a beautiful young girl be strong be strong with all the love in the world God bless❤
On the behalf of the CULTURE of Black America  🙏  for Michael Strahan and his daughter.

Isabella I have you on my prayer list. Be blessed! God’s got you!!!🕊️🙏🏽🙌🏽
I am going to continue to pray for Isabella and the entire family. I commend you for sharing your story because just hearing what was happening to you will help others who may be going through the same thing and have no idea why they’re having these extreme headaches. You are a strong brave young lady and we all continually hope for all the best for you.
Prayers for her. But why is going public with personal family matters considered a “move”?  In 2024 can we keep some things to ourselves and not try to make it a media spectacle?
My brother in law went through similar..surgery..radiation..chemo.... 15 years later...he's still rocking it ❤
God bless this family, give them strength and patience where there is none Lord fill them and uplift them with your Love, in Jesus's mighty name...AMEN ❤
Wow, Michael Strahan I never knew you were under that kind of stress. Your daughter. I’ll pray for you and your family. Hang in there.

Lord. Please heal this young woman and ever other child facing any type is life threatening sickness, Disease, or cancer. You are able. Amen
Oh my goodness what an amazing young woman! I’m inspired that at 50 I’m so selfish and have no reason to complain about anything, inspired to do better because every second of the day is a true gift. This girl is going to be doing some amazing things in her life, she’s gonna beat it!🙏❤️

As an 18 (M) twin I was diagnosed with the exact same type of cancer Medulloblastoma in 2020. I’ve been there you’ve got this! Took a tough year and a half but you’ll get there. Looking back it feels like it went so quick but when going through treatment seems to drag on.
Awesome story!  I'm standing with you, in Jesus' name & thank you for sharing.
May God Bless and keep your entire family 🙏🏻
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾to this young lady and the entire ! #EFFCANCER
Praying for you Isabella, and your family.
I have three grown sons and a daughter who’s 9. When it comes to hearing news like Michael did with his sweet daughter Isabella, I don’t think there’s anything that can prepare you for that. I couldn’t imagine hearing that about one of my kids.  Isabella is being so strong yet you can feel that the tears and the fear is just under the surface. The dad in me reared up as well. I could have easily cried an ugly cry if I hadn’t caught myself first. Prayers go out to the Strahan’s, especially to Isabella from me and my sweet 9 year old daughter. We are wishing you a complete recovery and that your experience might somehow help someone who really needs to feel loved and cared about and if they are feeling low on hope ….. that your family’s journey will help them to feel more hopeful about their particular journey.  Keep your head up Isabella, you’re a strong and beautiful young lady and I also pray that your doctors are blessed with the insight to do just what needs to be done for you and any other patients that they are treating. ❤😘🥰❤️
Praying for you Isabella 🙏.  You will conquer all
Isabella you and God have this.
Our hearts and prayers with his family.
I also was diagnosed with a brain tumor. Although I'm not as young as a young lady, it's scary no matter what age. I also did radiation. My experience was a little different because it was a very high dose of one and done. I don't know if it helped until the end of this month. She's a beautiful, brilliant young lady and hun. If you read this, you're going to go far, not just because you have a great family and a great support team around you. But your positivity is extremely important of getting through this challenge. You can do it. God bless you beautiful on my lady
I wish her well. Stay strong, and positive.
isabella , you just touched my heart young lady. Man, Ive never seen a more beautiful woman with a bald head. you will make it through. I just feel it.Bless you
YES YOU COULD BE PROUD OF HER ,SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GIRL , MY PRAYERS TONIGHT WILL BE FOR HER 🙏❤️
I have a rare genetic disorder called Neurofibromatosis Type 2. I have brain tumors. They hurt but thankfully they are not cancer. She got this.
My prayers go out to Mr. Strahan and his daughter, he is an exceptional human being and his daughter is a ray of sunshine. I have 2 daughters and I don't know how I would be able to go one if something like this happens. Very strong family.
Was operated, but no hair was shaved off🤔
Praying for you Isabella...  Your a definite role model for all of us! God bless.
May the Lord continue to heal and bless you and your family,. Praying for you always ❤. You've got this Isabella. Victorious.
GOD BLESS 🙌 🙏
GIRL.. YOU DON'T EVEN NEED HAIR.. IT WOULD JUST BLOCK YOUR BEAUTY! YOU LOOK GREAT! 😊❤
Just wow 😢😢😢 Her strength  Your strength  God’s strength

What a strong, courageous and BEAUTIFUL young lady you are Isabella! Thank you for sharing your story and bringing awareness of this condition! May you continue to be blessed and soon be back in perfect health. Sending e-hugs and prayers to you, your family, and anyone else 😊who is going through a tough, challenging situation right now❤
I wish your daughter the best
I also was diagnosed with a brain tumor but at 6 years old instead of 18. Isabella, you are one tough cookie!!! ❤❤❤
God bless her ! What a beautiful and sweet girl.
You are very beautiful
Side eye. Why are so many young people getting cancer.
❤praying for you …you are so strong 💪
From one brain surgery survivor: I'm so sorry. No child deserves this to happen, ever. You're doing exactly the right thing sir in supporting your daughter in any way you can. Know that, no matter how bad it could become, there is always hope that she can recover. The human mind is a remarkably strong thing, and your daughter assuredly has the strength to recover.    I was able to come back from half of my body being paralyzed, and I have full confidence that she will absolutely recover. Godspeed, and good luck to you both.
What a beautiful woman. I pray the sun is always on your face and the wind is behind you. God bless you
Love and prayers for all of you!!!! Stay strong💗
🙏🙏🙏
It’s called turbo cancer. She can thank the vac-cine.
She looks so tired but she’s smiling thru the pain beautiful

I will pray for her god is great turn to him now he needs u. I had breast cancer I went through chemo and let me tell u u have to be tough and strong I will pray for her
GOD BLESS MICHAEL STRAHAN'S BEAUTIFUL FAMILY!!!
With such supportive father nothing to be scared
Isabella, I was greatly moved by YOU.  I am praying for you and with you and your family.. You are beautiful in ways people often do not have a chance to see.  I went through breast cancer. The road one travels with cancer is often isolated even with family and friends.  Truly having family and friends helps the journey.  Bravo for sharing your story and for creating the youtube channel. You possess immense GRACE, compassion for others and strength.  I agree you will crush it.  You look beautiful in pink.  You wear it well.  God Bless.
Praying❤
She is awesome and an inspiration to soooo many others…. As a breast cancer survivor I empathize… she has many years ahead of her after she can get past this…. Sending prayers and love.
We pray to Yahweh for his intervention
Blessings to you and your beautiful daughter. Praying for a full recovery ❤️❤️🙏🏽🙏🏽

Isabella I saw you in North Carolina when you were a child and living in my area. You are truly a bright spot in this world. You are brilliant and beautiful and strong! 💪❤
I cried when I saw this young, beautiful girl fighting cancer of the brain.  She is young, a college student, with everything going for her, when she was diagnosed with this awful diagnosis.  My prayers are with her.  I pray to God she beats this awful illness, and goes on to have a fabulous life.  Maybe she will become a doctor and help other people going through cancer.
Prayers to Isabella and her family. ❤🙏🏼🙏🏼💐
So sad, I hope she beats this .  Poor girl.
Love and prayers for this beautiful young lady and family 💕💕💕🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I think Michael is good guy i hope she gets full recovery
Boy! This broke my heart 😢. Michael is so strong for his baby🩷🙏🏾. I have twins and I can’t imagine the pain her sister is in as well. It’s so hard when your love ones are going through something that you can’t physically do anything to help💪🏾🙏🏾🩷
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾♥️♥️♥️♥️
God Bless ♥️
❤🙏🏻 praying for her and I imagine is a blessing to have your family beside you… I have a baby tumor in my head is 5 mm but I’m worry because I have no father no mother no family in this country and two kids that depend on me
Yesterday as I watched your story on GMA I was getting ready to go see my oncologist. When I got there she told me I was done!!! It was finished!!! I didn’t have to come anymore!!!! I cried all the way back to my car. I have been dealing with this for 15 years. But God brought me through and he will you also. As I was thinking about this I had the feeling that soon you will be done with it also. You will hear those same words that you are fully recovered! God bless you sweet child and know I am praying for you.
💜💜💜…Isabella you are BEAUTIFUL!!!
May God bless all of you!
Lord is with you and your family 🙏🙏🙏
Shes beautiful! Prayers to you all.
Bless her heart.  She is very brave.
Why, but you are not alone.  God will see you through New jersey T.b. you are so pretty  .smile. God is with you.
Kancer is caused by parasites.   Fenbendazole kills and parasites and Kancer !!!   Do your own research people !!!
To Michael and his daughter,  thank you for sharing your family medical challenges. The good Lord will not be far from you and your family at this time of need. I observed how strong your daughter is. She has awesome attitude towards her future. She is already looking forward to going back to College. That is a great fortitude and determined Zeel to not allow this terrible illness to get her down. As a parent of three daughters I can't imagine the feelings and agony you all are going through. Michael, your daughter is trooper without any doubt. The good Lord will see your daughter through.
🙏🏻🙏🏻💜💜. You got this!

Bless your daddy’s heart  Michael. Love and prayers for Isabella and your family. ❤️🙏❤️
Isabella, I'm Praying for total and complete healing over you. God bless you and your family.❤
I have shared. Very good teaching.
Chemo kills
If she had the COVID vaccine, then it answers everything
My heart goes out to Michael Strahan and his family. Brain cancer is what killed my grandfather almost 6 years ago and to see it in someone so young is just so unfair. Stay strong, Isabella Strahan. I'll be praying for you as you continue your journey.
This brain cancer she has is one of the rarest worst brain cancers to have. I truly hope she stays strong and fights hard. God please help and look over her. She is far too young and has her whole life a head of her.
God bless 🙌 Isabella! You got this, beautiful girl!! ❤
Hugs and prayers for Isabella and all the family during this horrific experience. Isabella looks as beautiful as ever and she has turned into an amazing young woman. Adding her to my daily prayer list. 🙏🏻

It touched my heart
😢😢😢😢😢 what a lovely 🥰 interview Robbyn. Thumbs 👍🏾 up to You Brother 👦🏾 Michael. You’re doing an excellent job as a father. God’s got You 🫵🏾
she made cry 😢 please heal this angel Lord Jesus 🙏 ❤
Omg, this has to be so hard!!!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
May God heal you Mr bless you every step of the way. ❤️❤️🙏🏻
❤❤❤❤
My heart goes out to this beautiful brave young woman may God give her a strike to recover from all of this and look up brightfall life. I just feel like it was way too soon for them. To do this interview on her and you could see she's emotionally in a lot of pig which is totally understandable. They should have waited until she was in full recovery. And she was in a mental space to do this.
🙏🏽❤️
Any comment of encouragement goes a long way😢 you are amazing, strong, and brilliant 🎉 God is blessing you by helping so many. With love from Florida.. this too shall pass, you’ll be a old lady one day looking back on these moments and saying you did it 🎉❤
💕💕💕💕💕💕
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💜💜💜💜💜
I TOTALLY understand it!!!! My daughter was 10 on Sept. 28th, 2001 was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma, stage 2B, just 2 days before her 11th birthday in her chest that damaged the right side of her heart l. Her doctor's used Dukes protocol for her treatments also. She was on aggressive chemo at first, and afterward, she had 35 weeks of radiation. She was cancer free until about 2002. So, about 2015, she had cancer again, but this time, it was in her sweat glands in her back. I can't pronounce it, but thankfully, all they had to do was remove it, so she didn't have to go on any treatments. I thank God for her constantly 🙏🏾. So I pray for any parents that have to go through this.
Best wishes praying for you stay strong you're amazing
I started following Michael when I learned he was dating Nicole Murphy.  I could sense his heart for others. His love for his parents (especially his mother) led to believe that he was probably a good father. I love how he kept this private and made sure Isabella was sure she wanted to come forward and let the world know what she is going through. This was a touching yet inspiring story. Isabella is so pretty and I agree with Ms. Robin, Isabella is rockin the bald head. 🥰👏👏👏👏One can only hope a less fortunate child with cancer is receiving love and support through their journey too.
Thank you Isabella and Michael for having the love and courage to share your journey. I am praying with your for whole and full healing Amen  I encourage her to get into therapy so she can express her fears and concerns and joys in a safe way.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Prayers for continued healing 🙏
Isabella is so brave & beautiful. Sending love & prayers
🙏🏾ing-God has taken the wheel-he's already healed-Amen
Prayers…
Keeping fighting you’ll make it through this
May God bless and heal you Isabella.  May he fill you with his peace that surpasses all understanding.  HE is the divine healer master physician.  I rebuke cancer and claim your healing in Jesus’ mighty & powerful name.  Amen. 🙏🏾❤️🙏🏼
Isabella you got this anytime you get afraid think of this I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength
God got you young lady🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
This was so Beautiful‼️She's so Beautiful 😍 Thank You for sharing‼️ I'm praying 🙏🏿 for you all‼️Giving Hope to so many
I’m so sorry!… I received that call that used the words “brain tumor” in the same sentence as my child’s name.  Crying out to God was all that got me through, and I still have my child, 17 years later!!!…there is hope! I’m standing in prayer with everyone for a full and complete recovery, and strength to sustain you all 🙏
What’s the name of her youtube channel?
God bless you on your next journey with your treatment
Praying for a speedy recovery 🙏🏾
Stay strong young lady.
God does give us more…. Because he wants us to depend on him he wants us to be on our knees, realizing we have no power without him. Praying 🙏 for the HOLY SPIRIT to reveal this❤
Beautiful girl , wish you quick recovery
God Bless you, Isabella and keep up the good work. God is good!!
My grandmother had stomach cancer. She beat it for 28 years. She was cancer free she got to see me born in many of her grandkids. She lives long enough to know she was a great grandma for the first time when my cousin was born unfortunately, she died a few weeks after he was born she didn’t get a chance to meet him, but she did live a beautiful cancer, free life she died of natural causes It was a blessing to have her. I’m setting prayers to this young warrior who I know will be cancer just like my grandmother and she will live many years making many memories
Isabella, you are such a beautiful, intelligent girl with a smile and bright as the sun. No wonder your dad is so proud of you. Good job, dad! I’m going through cancer treatment too for a relapse. I’m much older and it’s hard but for such a young person it must be so awful and unfathomable. I hate seeing a young person with this horrible disease. It seems so unfair. I wish the best for you. I pray that you will have a long, happy, productive life after you kick cancer’s butt.
Such a beautiful, strong young woman. Stay positive, strong, accept the love around you, and keep moving forward. All the best to you, and all of your family. You got this!🥰
Wow, no one survives that tumor. Praying for her.
I have cancer CLL. I was diagnosed in 2017. When Robin asked Michael what did you learn through this.I said out loud your not as strong as you thought! I was right, My daughter said the exact same thing.  I had cancer when Robin was going through her battle..Isabella stay strong there will be days when you do chemo that you don't feel the best, it happens to me. I been doing chemo for almost 7 yrs..JUST REMEMBER you can do this ! You and I (robin also) are warriors against this horrible cancer! ALSO..remember if you are having a tough day talk to your wonderful Dad, your twin and your mom and friends and Robin. It helps!  I know you are a famous person like your dad and Robin but if you really do read this you can also talk to me I have been through what your going to go through. I'm aware that sounds crazy but in case. I so wished i could have talked to Robin also .  Its scary but God is with you EVERY step you take. God bless you, and your family. Aurora
I’m in tears. Michael has always loved his daughters so much. What a man. And Isabella is so beautiful inside and out. What an angel and what a light❤
This made me tear up the bond that I share with my twin I couldn't imagine going through this life without her even though at times we fight this just made me want to hug her. 💕👯‍♀
Shedding tears with you.  Michael you are so encouraging with Isabella and I can feel your support for her.  Isabella you are a very brave girl.  Fight the good fight.  I don’t know you but I am so impressed with your courage and message.  Sending love and prayers to all of you.
If I could by Regina Belle!!
Turned 60 this year and battled childhood neuroblastoma at 3!  Keep the faith dear girl. All my love sent to you ❤
This saddens me so much! I pray, LORD rain down upon this family grace and comfort that they need to endure through this challenging time. We pray for restoration of health and that she would encounter Jesus our Savior in a life changing way. I must say, I'm angry as well. The FDA, CDC, WHO, and many individuals who are in a position of oversight are ignoring the negative effects of the Covid vaccine. See video link below:  Florida Surgeon General calls for halt to COVID-19 vaccine, citing possible cancer risks / FOX 35 Orlando https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD345Ln-nbw
Isabella (my Mom's name was Isabelle!), as a brain injury survivor, I can surely relate to some of what you're going through. Remember, the human brain is amazing. I  recall what I couldn't do after my injury & now my brain has done some rerouting & rewiring which I'm sure you'll be experiencing.Thank you for sharing your story. I will be praying for you & your family. June
God bless you sweet girl! You are strong and have great support and medical care! One day at at time!❤
I wish this young lady success in her treatment🎉. My cousin was diagnosed with this same cancer and was an adult. He fought the battle as long as he could however lost the fight. Stay positive and give it to God❤❤
Praying for your recovery along with so many others also suffering from a insidious illness. I lost two  Extremely close Family members to this. I know Isabella will win and be just fine. She is absolutely Stunning, and a shining light for so many!! You will be a positive out there for so many, but remember the most important thing you need to do is take care of your self, Rest when you need to, it is very important, and know that God is watching over you.
I'm praying for Isabella's complete healing!!! Thanks for sharing your story
God Bless this family... Isabella we love you... keep fighting the good fight Princess ❤❤❤❤❤
😢😢😢🙏🏽 as a brain aneurysm survivor I understand getting to your life back
Isabella, you are an amazing, beautiful, and compassionate person. Sharing your story was more than brave, it was heroic. I was really touched by your strength and enthusiasm. You are the voice for many that would give up and hide away. Your love and encouragement will help many. God bless you 💞
God bless Isabella and I pray for her complete recovery 🙏🏼🙏🏼
This interview brought me to tears.  As a parent, I can’t imagine how it feels to find out news like this.  That’s why I’m grateful every single day.  This is the thing that matters, your family, your loved ones.  I hope the best for Isabella and the Strahan family.
Sending🙏🏾 ❤️🕯️and healing energy ❤️‍🩹
Praying for them and her full and complete healing and RECOVERY!❤❤❤❤❤‼️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🥰💕💕💕💕
I'm a survivor of a childhood cancer. This brought back a whole lot of emotions. But, I'm still here, and Isabella, my prayers are with you to beat this and tell your story as much as possible. You're helping others who are struggling with something
Praying for healing in Jesus name Amen 🙏🏿💗
You gor thi Isabella...Praying for you...
My child was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer this summer , as I sat here in tears ...... every word cuts deep into my soul. God bless everyone battling cancer out there.
I am praying for a speedy recovery for Isabella! She is strong and she will get through this like the warrior she is. ❤ she has such an amazing village around her. She is truly an inspiration and will continue to be IN LIFE❤️❤️
Prayers to you and your family for a full recovery. Isabella, you are courageous and brave and you will get through this.
🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️
Awww. She has a twin sister?!?! So do I. Awww
Sending love to the strahan family and Isabella. Cancer is horrible.
😔
How about you not glorify her because of her bastard father? Where are all the interviews of mothers and fathers out there who struggle every day to find or pay for treatment of their child. Michael can rot in hell before I have any sympathy. He’s wealthy and will get the best treatment in the world for his daughter.
Love, Light, Well-being & Prayers to you Isabella & family.😪💔❤️‍🩹💞🕯☦️🙏🏾
Such a courageous woman! Really moved by her amazingness
Praying for Isabella -Healing Scriptures -  Heal me, O Lord, and I will be healed; save me and I will be saved, for you are the one I praise." ~ Jeremiah 17:14  * "Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven." ~ James 5:14-15   * "Worship the LORD your God, and his blessing will be on your food and water. I will take away sickness from among you…" Exodus 23:25   Nevertheless, I will bring health and healing to it; I will heal my people and will let them enjoy abundant peace and security." ~ Jeremiah 33:6   * "And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus." ~ Philippians 4:19   He himself bore our sins” in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; “by his wounds you have been healed.” ~ 1 Peter 2:24   LORD my God, I  called to you for help, and you healed me." ~ Psalms 30:2  Jeremiah 30:17  17  But I will restore you to health     and heal your wounds,’ declares the Lord, ‘because you are called an outcast,     Zion for whom no one cares.  Exodus 23:25 New International Version   25 “Worship the Lord your God, and his blessing will be on your food and water. I will take away sickness from among you,”
I am praying for complete healing for Isabella Strahan in Jesus' name. Let us all pray for healing for Isabella.

Michael Strahan, great athlete,  great man , and more importantly great dad
I literally cried thru this segment.  I know it was close to Robin as well.  The journey isn't easy.  I survived ovarian stage 3c and melanoma stage 1 in 2012.  Such a tough journey for someone so young.  You are beautiful, young and have your whole life ahead. Sometimes we go thru things to shift our perspective of life.  Don't cry beautiful.  You will be just fine. #Survivor 💪
what is the name of the doctor that actually removed her tumor?
Stay strong and brave as you are, Issabella. You are an inspiration to all of us. Wishing you a great life ahead. 🌷🌷💪💪🌈🌈
Your story yesterday on GMA was so touching and heartrending. It had me in tears. I've ridden for the last couple of years in support of the Great Cycle Challenge's charity rides in support of the Children's Cancer Fund. I was having second thoughts about riding for the event again this September. However, after hearing your story, I am planning on riding again this year in your honor. I wish you a full recovery and a happy and a long, fulfilling life.
My prayers go up to you for a fast recovery. And cancer free! God bless you and your family.❤
Oh my goodness I couldn't stop crying watching this! All that she's been through at such a young age and their strength and vulnerability! May God continue to carry you and your family through. That father-daughter relationship ❤!
May God heal her . This breaks my heart. Beautiful girls. Praying for you.
I remember when I was younger and me spending time at the hospital to remove my tumor. This was sad but she’s strong ! God is good ! You’ll be fine ❤
So inspiring. My prayers are with you all.
Praying for Isabella
Isabella, you are a strong, resilient young woman, You have a long way to go in life.  We know that you will pull throguh. We all love you.
I always like Mike as a player and he seems to be a decent person, too bad he is on such a alt-left liberal toadies show, sold out for the cash I guess, it would be funny is she had his gap tooth
❤😅
You are an INSPIRATION to us all!  KEEP fighting Warrior Princess❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😢❤THIS STORY IS VERY TOUCHING KNOWING THAT YOUR CHILD HAVE BRAIN 🧠  CANCER NO PANRANT SHOULD HEAR THAT THEY CHILD HAVE SOME KIND OF SICKNESS STAY STRONG HOLD YOUR HEAD UP THE LORD IS IN YOUR SIDE ..I HAVE 3 KIDS 2 GIRLS AND 1 BOY MAY GOD BLESS ISABELLA 🙌 🙏 I WILL KEEP PRAYING FOR YOU WRITTING FROM BROOKLYN NEW YORK ❤😢
Isabella, you are now in   my prayers. My heart goes out to all children and young adults with cancer. I had a golf ball size mass removed from my head on 2/10/23. I went to bed with a headache  and woke up with a headache. I was walking sideways but driving straight. I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer that spreaded from the lung to the brain. I've had radiation treatments and rung the bell in May of 2023. The cancer came back with a vengeance in November/23 the lung cc came back again claiming the brain, liver and breast. I'm 68. You are young, don't give in to the devil. Claim your victory. When you feel weak, say you are strong and be strong. I believe I am only still here because of my faith. I believe in miracles and the promises Jesus Christ has over my life.💙🙏🧡
🙏🏾🫶🏾
Prayers goes out to her and the rest of fam! Stay strong young woman.🫠🫠❤❤🙏🙏

Prayers to Isabelle & family.🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🌹 . keep your faith family. God is in control 💕
It can happen to anyone, st any age , My Heart ❤️ goes out to the Family
When God bring you through there is a spiritual message you must share with the world. I haven't heard God mentioned at all.
What a beautiful father you have a beautiful daughter and you’ve done a great job give it to God and let him work it out remember no more than what we can bear
I’m sincerely happy she’s okay, but what are we doing?   Honestly why do we need to get attention for everything.   This just shows how ass backwards our health care system is.
Could it be God giving payback from past behavior?
😢😢😢😢😢wow that story tore me up … Father God in the name of Jesus Isabella is HEALED IN THE NAME JESUS 🙌🏾🙏🏽🙏🏽
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Blessings come from where and when one least expects. You folks are blessed. Rock on Isabella. Solid job.
🙏🏾❣🙏🏾 God is with you and you got this baby girl
I was diagnosed with medulloblastoma at 25; almost 10 years ago. I did the same thing. I had surgery, then proton radiation, then chemo. For me, you have done the worst part. I had a horrible time with proton radiation. Chemo was easier. I was  terrified of chemo after my radiation experience. I lasted almost 8 years without it coming back. I had a second craniotomy. When it came back, there were lots of medical advancements. I'm about to start a clinical trial at the national institute of health, where my original neuro oncologist at MD Anderson went. My oncologist was Marta Penas-Predo and I am still being treated at MD Anderson. Dr. Penas-Prado's specialty is adult medulloblastoma and she is a national expert. Obviously I'm not saying you should change, I have her as backup, and she just started this trial two weeks ago. Take heart. I was in my last year of law school when I was diagnosed, a week before my law school exams and a month before graduation. I was able to graduate and pass the bar. I've been an attorney ever since.
I’m so touch by this powerful message and my is heart breaking. We as parents never want to see our kids hurting, but like you said this is her journey. She exemplify being such a strong young lady. One thing about life we know where we have been in life but don’t know our journey. I will continue to pray for all people of this earth; will send uplifting 🙏🏽🙏🏽prayers for you and your family. ❤️❤️❤️
Praying hard for you!!🙏🏾🙏🏾🩷🩷🙏🏾🙏🏾
I pray she learns of trying herbs to help...may GOD bless them and heal her body
Isabella bless you and your family as you navigate through this moment in your life!!  YOU GOT THIS!!💕
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Sounds like the c
Isabella - you are SO STRONG sharing your story! My daughter Hannah Fray went through a similar situation right before her senior year in high school. She was having tremors, and we couldn’t figure out what was going on. After 2 missed diagnoses, we learned that Hannah had a tumor called a Pilocytic Astrocytoma, the size of a nectarine, and needed surgery at Vanderbilt. Hannah had a long battle with rehabilitation - learning to eat again, write, read, tie her shoes…….she also suffered peripheral vision loss, a large “field cut”, which required extensive neuro genesis training, to get some of her vision back. It was a 2 year process, but our village of family and friends were amazing in helping carry us through (It looks like you have the same amazing village with you!)  Hannah is now 24 (turned 24 yesterday…:) and has a full life. She graduated college (but the way, she was told she may not finish HS - she is tenacious like you seem to be - and proved them wrong). She also finished college (Dean’s List!) and started her own concierge business in Nashville TN. She is getting married in May of this year…..the tumor now in her past.  You are in our thoughts, and I just wanted to say what a STRONG and AMAZING young lady you seem to be - your interview on GMA will help so many people going through struggles, and your family and friends will help you through this.  If you ever need someone who has been through a very similar situation, please don’t hesitate to reach out….. you can message me and I’ll connect you with Hannah. She’d love to talk anytime.  XO  Leann Fray (Hannah’s mom)
God is great !!!!! At his will we can expect anything !!! 😢in Jesus name
What an amazingly brave young woman. More wins dearest. You will be okay!!!!

Micheal my prayers are with you and Isabella.  My husband and I received word our 40 yr old daughter, wife and mother of 3, has kidney cancer.  You are right in that this is news you never want to hear abt your child. She will have the tumor removed next month. God be with your daughter and our daughter, Karin🙏🙏♥️♥️👍👍
My son was diagnosed with Non Hodgkins Lymphoma at age 20 something only 1 out of 25,000 young adults get. Like they said it’s a younger child’s cancer. My son fought his battle  for 4 years my prayers are with this family.
His daughter is such a beautiful soul she’s so brave to share her story. May God continue to bless and heal her during this journey.

Wishing Isabella and the whole family all the best, stay strong 💪 and positive...
So sorry Mr. Michael. Praying for Your Family and Sweet, Sweet Girl.  She’s got this and will help others with her story.
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, so if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the kingdom of heaven and eternal life. To this, people would accept Jesus Christ in life in their hearts and told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and frees and gives eternal life for free 1
Very moving and thank you for sharing this story
Praying 🙏 for her
What an incredibly strong young lady. Isabella will go on to be an incredible human being ❤

So many comments so I’ll say this to anyone out there in this kind of battle…. I wish you well, keep up the good fight!! Many care about you. With love and a guiding light. ❤.  Isabella you are a ROCK STAR!!
you are awesome Isabella! we look forward to watch another interview with you in 60-70 years when you are an old old grandma darling <3
God Speed her recovery. God bless her. I pray right now that she has a full recovery. That through her journey her fear and innocence is protected and that she is sheltered by all guardian angels above. I ask you dear God to provide her the strength she needs to go through her journey or recovery. I pray that she has a peaceful journey and when fear arises that her mindset shifts to stay positive. This is beyond scary for her. How I wish I could take this allll away from her or anyone that experiences cancer. To her parents, may god also give you both the strength you need, may you continue to support her as you have. I feel broken for her and the family. Wishing you many many blessings and I cannot wait to see the other side of this story. I wait in anticipation. God Speed ❤️
😭 God bless her heart
Thank you for sharing this story and I wish you God speed Isabella 🙏 ❤

Let’s hope Chris rock doesn’t make another joke
Isabella you are beautiful and strong.  ❤❤
Ohhh poor baby. Will keep her in prayer 😢😢❤❤
Thank you so much for sharing and making brain cancer as a very serious and aggressive disease. I just lost my family member after about 20 months since diagnosis.  I wish you the best and keep living the best minute in life. So proud of all of you.
Thus made me cry for this young lady. She’s such a beautiful person.
Thank you for sharing Isabella!!!!!!!
Smart move getting Proton therapy. I went through it in Oklahoma and believe it helped save my life.  My prayers & thoughts are with her & family.
Im in tears! That was touching. You got this, Isabella!
Oh wow, this was so difficult to watch....as a parent of two teen girls, I see the humility in Michael.  No parent ever wants to see their children ill or suffering from an illness.  I wish Isabella victory in this battle and remember that sometimes we're here as a vessel for a larger platform beyond your control.  You are a gem, you will find the strength, and this experience will leave you as a better  role model for us all.  Stay blessed, strong, and many prayers for you. xoxo
Mike I will praying in the mighty name of JESUS for the complete healing of your daughter ❤❤❤❤❤❤

I am with cheering you on whilst running right beside you. Let’s win together! ️
Praying for a complete healing in Jesus’ name Isabella. I don’t know you but the Lord does. These illnesses do not come from the Lord - they come from the enemy who comes to steal, kill and destroy. Amen 🙏 ❤

My 29 year old has just recovered from his second brain tumor. First one was when he was six years old. Both tumors are very different, non cancerous so we hope for the best for the future. The only difference is from this day forward he will have a scan every 6-8 months whether health care pays or not.
What a beautiful brave young lady.  Sending you lots of prayers for a full recovery! xo From Ottawa, Canada.
Lots of love to you my 16-year-old nephew was just diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome positive lymphoma leukemia or to make it shorter PH+ALL it’s all up hill from here

😢😢😢😢
When my niece was 11 she kept complaining of headaches in the mornings after waking up. Her mom and I both told her to go to bed on time and stop staying up all night talking to her friends on her cell phone and her head wouldn't hurt in the mornings. She went to the doctor and the doctor agreed that she wasn't getting enough sleep. My niece saw a segment on mystery diagnosis and was convinced that she had a brain tumor and everyone laughed and told her to quit playing lol. Months later she was diagnosed with a astrocytoma and needed emergency surgery. After surgery she developed meningitis, and had to learn to walk and talk again. The entire tumor couldn't be removed because part of it is attached to her brain stem. So she has regular scans to check for growth and has been back in surgery to remove what they can twice more. She also has a shunt now. She's 26 now, married, a nurse, with three boys. And it's crazy, but less than a year later I was also diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2012. Totally unrelated, just a crazy coincidence
Thank you for sharing. Praying for you and so proud of your courage. May God continue to bless you and heal you.
What a fighter !
Bravo to your bravery Isabella! God Bless You 😂
He’s staying strong so he can best support his baby. She’s so strong. Sending love 💗.
Better start looking at who had the jab and which one. My DIL has brain cancer with in 8 weeks of jab.
LEARNING to make my own water ( consult with medical team )  H2O .🔵    🇺🇸
God bless your sweet Isabella ❤

Michael, What the bible says is not you are never given more than you can handle.  It is you are never given more than God can handle.  Praying for you and your daughter and your family.  Cancer sucks.  I have been though it several times.
Isabella you are so strong! Praying for your strength and journey. You Got This! 🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️
Wow.. I think I cried this entire interview…😢😢what a brave, strong young lady she is! God bless her and anyone going through this. I as a mom cannot imagine. My family does donate to St Jude, have for many years and this is the exact reason why. Cancer has touched my immediate family directly a few times and it’s scary, ugly, I always wish for cures, relief, prevention. Her bravery and courage makes me never want to complain again when I get a headache my gosh, and I think speaking up is absolutely helpful to so many that are young, going through cancer, any kind of tumor, brain tumor I think these messages are just so incredibly powerful for anyone to hear. It’s a reminder that anything can happen to anyone at any time. None of us are untouchable. God bless her, the Strahan family and anyone going through any kind of illness. I pray 🙏🏼 you get better and feel the love  ❤️ and hugs being sent your way.
Isabella, you're being so much like Jesus! He had and has loving compassion on the sick!! I pray the great Physician touches you very soon with complete healing!! I pray you continue to have your amazing fortitude! You have a beautiful smile that will brighten everyone's day who is fortunate enough to see it!! Shalom! With love❤, Linda D. In Grand Rapids Michigan
God bless you 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤
They forgot the thank the only one who brought her through this whole thing. The Lord Jesus Christ he  healed her and not once did they thank him. So I will. Praise be the Glory to the Lord Jesus Christ that you my sweet darling child of God are healed.❤️🙏
❤ 🙏🏽 😊
Wiahing you a full recovery from a grateful cancer survivor.
Michael my heart goes out to you and your family at this time. Your daughter is absolutely beautiful.  The relationship between the two of you is wonderful.

Now he is 29 and living a good life! Keep up the good spirit Mamash you will over come this and this is peace of cake for what GOD has for you❤

I have seen a Neurologist since I was her age for headaches and migraines. On one of my yearly test they did find something.  We push headaches aside and write people off.  Please don't.  She is so brave.  Thank you for sharing Isabella.

Isabella I am so glad you got treatment right away. My best friend’s daughter had a brain tumor when she was 3 years old. She had two surgeries, chemo and radiation. She finished college and is 28 years old. I know this is hard, but I believe in you. Crying is normal, I guarantee millions of people were crying right along with you myself included.

Thank you Isabella God Bless you🙏 💌 I wish I had watched this episode earlier in the day because I am a 64 year old woman with pancreatic cancer who having chemotherapy just 4 shots right now and I cancelled tomorrow's chemo because I gave up the fight plus I don't have much support but seeing how strong, amazing, resilient and beautiful young lady you are just hearing your words watching you cry brought tears 😢 to my eyes and made me think I could do this if young kids are fighting I could fight as well. I guess what I am trying to say is you are 💯 an inspiration in my life and everyone us 👏💪🤗 Thank you
My mother suffered from the same     for years every since we was little and her tumor was behind her eyes it was a size of a golf ball he took meds to treat it because it was to risky to have surgery she had chemo therapy but she died in 2021 but it wasn't not from that it was from cov19 so I say this to you young lady keep faith don't give up much love to you and your family  you will be ok because God got you just keep telling your testimony
The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have [it] more abundantly- John 10:10. I pray that God will heal her and let it be an powerful testimony for her to share.

Praying for Isabella!
May god bless you Isabella. I will keep you and family in my prayers. Thank you for sharing. As a parent I could only imagine how Michael feels. He has to be strong but I guarantee behind closed doors this is the hardest thing he’s ever been through. I have faith this young woman will pull through
I have went through the process of radiation, and I also have a brain tumor myself that is (non-cancer). It was uncomfortable, but worth it in the end because my tumor got smaller. and my parents and family were supporting me and I felt so loved and I got through it but instead of banging a gong, I get to get my hand painted and then put it on the wall when I was done.
Rock on Isabella!
Got the 💉💉💉💉. I am sure !!!!!!!!!!
God got you Micheal we love you so much!🙏🏾❤
No idea who he is
She is such a brave , strong  young lady.  So proud of her.  God bless you all always.   You will definitely beat this.  ❤❤
Praying without ceasing for each of you 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
The Blood of Jesus wash over everyone's  body fighting cancer and  give everyone. renewed strength each day Heavenly Father.  In Jesus Precious Name Amen 🙏

Prayers for a full recovery, thank you for sharing 🩷🩷
Beautiful people.  But I notice a lot of people have asked if she got the covid shot, wondering if this may have caused this.  What about the radiation from all of the portable phones pressed to the ear?
What an awesome young lady !
❤
You stay strong Isabella!!
My prayers go out to you and your family Isabella. God is carry you,  you will be better and strong again. Your dad is a great man and your family is surrounded around to make suŕe that you are good.🙏😇❤️
Michael the younger she is the better chances of success.

My prayers for the Strahan family
Michael, you said vitamin. No parents want to hear those words that you child has cancer. Well my son celebrated his 40th on Dec 8th, 5 days later he got the news he has Stage 3 rectal cancer. BUT he lives in Japan without family, so I just wanted to hop on a plane just to be there. His treatment starts in the coming week. If he was here in Canada, he'll be waiting until February.😢😢😢 I pray everyday that it hasn't spread or its one of the fast evasive cancer. Thank you for sharing. I've added your family to my prayer list.
Congratulations for ringing the bell 🛎️
Beautiful Queen you got this!
Such a beautiful young lady 🌹
Our thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.....God bless you all 🙏🙏🙏
Isabella, rock through this part of your story. You can do this. Remember you are going to be a warrior of cancer. Once you are cancer free! I have been down that road with Thyroid Cancer. And I am almost 5 years free. You can do it!!! We are rooting for you and your family!!!!
Thank you for sharing your story. Keep fighting and living your life to the fullest. Best wishes to a fast recovery. Stay strong to you and your loved ones. ❤
God bless you all ❤❤❤. I pray for complete healing for Isabella

Cancer sucks and although the treatment can be life-saving, it is difficult.  I hate seeing young people have to deal with serious illness.  Prayers for everyone impacted by cancer.
❤❤❤
🙏🙏🙏
Your courage is inspiring QUEEN U ARE SHINING ❤❤❤
This interview was so sad and so inspiring at the same time.  Isabella, to think that you are going through this tough time right now and you are sharing your story to help others, is remarkable!   You JUST rang the bell yesterday, marking the end of your radiation, so you will be emotional as you were in this interview, but you will conquer this.  You are a star! ❤
No parent has to lose a kid no matter what. I am speechless. Thoughts and prayers 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Even though your daughter is an adult, shes still your baby, cancer in any form sucks. We sending you prayers from the Great state of Texas. Get well soon.

WOW...Isabella, you are a BEAUTIFUL and  STRONG young woman! You got this!! We are All praying and sending Love to you and your family.❤
I followed Robin Roberts as she  fought cancer several times over the years. What a strong amazing woman she is! I much later in life wound up getting metastatic thyroid cancer, breast cancer,+ squamous cell cancer. Even tho I did very different options with each cancer, the method is not always what matters. Its( imho) the ability to focus+ move forward, one day at a time with the resolve of getting better, that makes it possible. She was an outstanding example to me. Thankyou Robin, from just a regular person, observing + listening to you🤗😻
Praying for you Isabella. God will give you the strength to go through this.
Brave and lovely girl. Well done Isabella
Bella you are the light i watch you and sis grow keep being strong❤️❤️💕🧘🏽🙏🏽I’m praying for you

We will be praying for Isabella and your family.
Wow. I feel the pain. My only child was diagnosed of an aggressive breast cancer in October 2023.  The worst phone call any parent would ever expect.  The worst part is as a parent you are so helpless to watch your child going tru this experience.  You are very strong and brave my dear. You are in my prayers and i would want you all to keep my daughter in prayers too as we go through this nightmare. But i know God is in total control in Jesus Mighty name. AMEN
Hi! My name is Mackenna! I’m reaching out because I’m a medulloblastoma survivor and I was also diagnosed at 19. I’m 28 now and cancer free. My family actually watched the interview and had to let me know of your battle because of how similar it sounded to mine.  I want to wish you and your family strength through this journey. Obviously it’s not easy, but a great support system and tenacity can take you very far. You got this! 🥊
I'm praying 🙏 for her. You're strong isabella u will get through this with the strength and support of your family and God.
Sending healing prayers for a full recovery
Bless her heart..❤❤❤
Thank you Michael, Isabella and Good Morning America for sharing this story. Isabella you are a gem and your story has me in tears. Thank you for your bravery. Praying for you as you start chemo. You got this!
Always Thank God for everything… including your cancer. God knows your soul, your destiny and your future. Pray for strength. I will pray for you. Your strength will change lives.
Tams was as big as a fist on her pituitary gland
You would be surprised how much karma comes upon your children because of what parents did. I’m Native American and every time my son was sick, I went to a medicine man and it was always something I had done in the past. One time he said I had killed a baby duck when I was 10 and my child had to pay for that. I did an offering and prayed. It got better! I remember the doctors saying, they didn’t know why his fever was so high. He almost passed. After prayer and a lot of offerings, he came out!
They have done a beautiful job with this young lady. Her future is so bright we need shades!
Lost a daughter to brain tumor
Praying for you and you daughter she will be just fine in the  name of Jesus I also give to st jude!!!!

Thank you Isabella for telling your story!  😭 I was 59 when I found out that I had a cyst in my brain.  Due to my age and the dangers associated with having it removed I decided not to have it removed!  Knowing how scared I was I can only imagine how Isabella feels.   You are a fighter Isabella and you keep fighting !  My thoughts and prayers will always be with you and your family now and always.
This brought tears in my eyes my prayers are with you.
❤Blessings
It's amazing how we become soo weak & its like fighting the release of weakness & the Lord just there & we have to let the weakness flood over us to release the unlimited strength seeded in us to take hold of to live while we fight. Thank you for sharing Isabella because there is always another who needs to witness your story. Bless 🫵🙏🤍

Thanks for sharing her story! We also just found out last month that my beautiful sister had a brain tumor the size of a large onion. Three weeks ago she had emergency life saving surgery. She is only 39. To think, my sis found out something was wrong with a routine eye exam. Check out this video of her singing Lady Gaga during her surgery. https://youtu.be/mjJjLIwSZMg?si=4o_hu5AdA0a48hUd

I will be praying for your daughter, God bless her, and Thank her for sharing her story with the world.
I had the same symptoms where I couldn’t walk straight and nausea. It turned out to be a Hemangioblastoma brain tumor. Glad to report I got it removed and feel good. Glad she went to the doctor when she did, my doctor also found it after I was practically dragged in by my sister/mom
Don't know how true it is but I know someone who tried the soursop tea and when she went back to Dr they couldn't find her cancer.... It's supposed to help with certain cancers worth a try... 🙏🙏🙏
Oh my dear , May God be with You more than anyone that u really need and heal U …   Don’t be worry, God ll be with you !!
😢😊❤
I don't about cancer but I suffered a massive heart attack and God brought me through and I also have a twin sister and she was so afraid she would lose me we have a strong Christian Faith God bless you Isabella fight on

Why are so much of you getting cancers? Did you all line up together and take medicine for something? drank the same soda or something? Only thing I can think of is the Vax.  But that’s impossible cause the government loves you and it’s safe and effective like they say. Very weird
🙏🏾 praying for your family
Omg My granddaughter Sofia who is 5 yrs old was DX with exact same thing in July It's been 6 months now and my little baby just got home She is now with her new baby brother and parents!

Your strength is AMAZING! Prayers for continued strength and determination for you and your family. You got this!
I was 14 when I suffered a blood vessel rupture between the brain & cerebellum ...sigh .... hard to watch...  U got this sweet girl....it's a  journey...   I 'm 53 now and very blessed!   .. watch....
It’s crazy watching all these people get cancer soo young while none of you have a brain to figure out why it’s happening.  You all breeze passed the news, that the shots are causing turbo cancers. You all just need to just pack it  on up and get on outta here like Fauci wants.  You have no purpose if you’re not using your brains.  Yall aren’t even fighting back.  So what is your purpose? To play stupid , blind and ignore all the damage and deaths?  Cowardice.
Keep fighting  Isabella ❤ I will be praying for you and your family ❤
I literally broke down sobbing watching this interview. Wishing her a speedy recovery
Praying for her
Jesus is a Healer🙏🏾
Praying for them all! She's a beautiful, strong young lady!!
The lord will  fix it for  her and  for the  family
😭😭😭😭
My son was 16 years old when he was diagnosed with Burkitt's lymphoma. Just headed out for a night of fun when the call came in. We were asked to make our way down to the E.R. as soon as we could. . .I remember my husband and I desperately holding on to each other as we waited for the double bone marrow biopsy to be performed. I remember when his beautiful head full of curls began to randomly fall out for the first time, finding them on his pillow...shaving his head...wondering why...trying to be strong,  and  yet crying myself to sleep every night and praying to God to let me somehow trade places with him... He will be celebrating his 32nd birthday the end of this month!  SINCERELY SENDING LOVE AND PRAYERS TO ISABELLA AND HER FAMILY! Xo Xo Xo...GOD BLESS...Xo Xo Xo ...
So heart warming, so brave.. Thanks Isabella for sharing your story. I'm believing and praying for you and your family🌺
My God I’m 🙏🏾🙏🏾for your family Michael

#1 Dad 🏆❤️
He raised a child with a sweet, beautiful spirit. That shines through like bright sunlight. I hope all the best in healing and in life for her. Poor daddy. You’d rather it happen to you than have to watch your child suffer. He’s doing an excellent job at being strong for her. I’m sure the calm assurance she sees in his face gets her through many a rough days.

Mr Strahan, you have sown so much of yourself into others and God is going to bless you through a full recovery of your daughter's health because your reaping spills over to your children, they are beneficiaries of the blessings that God has for you.  I celebrate your daughter's full recovery NOW because HE'S FAITHFUL!! Continued blessings!!
I have a younger sister who was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor last October, needing emergency surgery to remove her tumor just days after Halloween.  Watching her recuperate from the surgery and the experience really rocked me to my very core.  I'm also a cancer survivor myself (neuroendocrine cancer, appendix) and applaud both Michael, Isabella and the Strahan family for bringing awareness through what they are doing with St. Duke's Hospital and her YouTube channel!  God bless you all and keep on keeping on!
She is full of light and so brave! My prayers for her complete recovery, love and hugs!
How beautiful are they. Wonderful young woman surrounded by people that love her. Blessing for them.
Yikes that made me weep..
Beauty and grace and strength personified. Wishing you a full recovery. ❤
4:23 Husband had a tumor in his head, nerve tissue acoustic nerve.   Grapefruit sized.  Removed.  Side effects from it eventually killed him.  He had 12 good years after!!  If you knew him you'd understand why so many people miss him.  Besides me.  He was a saint and an angel.
Praying for you Isabella ❤
Thanks for the truth an trust in your daughter. More young people need to be aware an deal with there health. Blessings
What a beautiful young lady, Isabella, I claim your complete healing in Jesus' name.
Praying for Isabella's FULL recovery and Healing.  God is able
Prayers for Michael's daughter, may God heal and deliver.
I was also diagnosed with brain cancer in my freshman year at college. It was definitely not easy, as you know, but I had brain surgery followed by radiation therapy to help "kill" the part that couldn't be removed with surgery- but it finally died a couple of years later and has stayed dead for the past 12 years!  You got this, girl! And you look BEAUTIFUL!!!!
❤❤❤
Wishing her the best possible outcome
I'm a survivor of a childhood cancer. This brought back a whole lot of emotions. But, I'm still here, and Isabella, my prayers are with you to beat this and tell your story as much as possible. You're helping others who are struggling with something ❤❤❤
I imagine she’s immunosuppressed, and it’s incredibly frustrating to not see folks around her masking (aside from one of the pics with the nurses/care team) and taking her health into consideration
Praying for this beautiful young lady and their family. Im just sitting here watching this crying my eyes out she is brave strong beautiful and she will get through this one day at a time. Life can change in a second and right before your eyes.
Keep fighting like you are. XXOO.
Sending Isabella so much love and support. ❤

Michael please tell Isabella how we are all praying for her recovery and she will make it! And not to be afraid of the journey. Make sure you all take care of yourselves!!!
Oh my goodness I couldn't stop the tears. The "ages 5 to 9" started it and it just wouldnt stop flowing. We are not suppose to bury our babies they are suppose to bury us. This was so raw and she has so much grace and strength. The part that stuck for me was his answer to what he learned from all of this. That your probably not as strong as you think you are that even the biggest and toughest need the same support they are always giving.
She is absolutely beautiful!😊
Bella toda una guerrera 💕💕

Thank you for sharing, I am also going thru a debilitating disease that is getting worse and causes constant excruciating pain. The one sentence that Michal said is god doesn’t give us more than we can handle…..thank you for reminding me of this, it can easily be forgotten when your the person going thru something. Many prayers for Isabella for continued improvement and a very long happy life.
🙏🏽🥰
Wishing Isabella the absolute best outcome! Micheal you are right… no parent should have to face this! As a mom of young adults, I feel your pain. Stay strong! ❤
Hang in there baby. You got this❤️
Prayers for Isabelle and family! Jesus is a healer!
I’m glad she’s Glowing with love a Pride
As a brain tumor survivor myself, I completely understand Isabella's situation.  It is tough.  It is emotional.  I pray that she leans on her family and friends.  It is okay to ask for help.  Also, please continue to get MRI for years to come.  My tumor came back after 10 years.  Take care of yourself Isabella!  You are a wonderful young lady!
Well …this incredibly bright, beautiful young lady has clearly gotten her looks from the mother!! An old Giants fan here wishing Michael and his precious Isabella all good things. How could a father be more proud? Michael..you are, to me, more World Class than I even knew. I am deeply moved by Isabella’s courage in sharing this very tough journey with others. Figures!!
I am praying for you and your family Isabella! Your strength and desire to share your journey is going to help a lot of people.  You got this beautiful!  I am so proud of you!
Beautifully brave♥
Praying for her and the family! God got her!
I hope she does well with her treatment. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Hi as I watch Isabella tell her story it’s heart wrenching but it’s still beautiful I’m a brain cancer Warrior 😂 going on 6 years 🙏🏽. You are a strong woman, crying is good it part of your healing and your positive outlook is beautiful, 🫶🏻.
My prayers are within everyone that has children going through situations like this. Michael Strahans daughter. This made me tear up.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾Prayers for the Strahan Family!  My niece was diagnosed with a neuroblastoma at the age of 4.  Lived 10 years after diagnosis.  Isabella, you’re a Beautiful Warrior and we are all praying for your recovery!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
my 16 yr old niece has 3 brain tumors,
She has all the means in the World to fight it. She doesn’t lack for anything. Many people have to fight much more aggressive diseases than her without any means to survive. Papa seems to be humiliated, pray Micheal.
Praying for Isabella!
That was so beautiful ❤
Sending prayers and positivity…….🦋💙🦋
God bless you both❤

Hi Isabella, I am Ruby 69 years old. I feel your sadness. I am very sad with you. I am so sorry.  I send good positive energy to reach you; I would like to offer a suggestion - whatever emotions you have, feel them do not suppress them if you are sad, feel your sadness and  be sad; if you want to cry; it is okay to cry. acknowledge and accept where you are in the now; go deep within; connect with your true self and embrace your feelings and emotions; there is strength and power within you.  Take lots of deep slow breaths in and out; Go deep inside; ask God to give you strength; ask Him for help. Believe in miracles; You are surrounded by love from your family, friends and all people that know of you. Miracles  happen. Please believe.
Rooting for you to heal Isabella! You're stronger than you know.
I've lost so many people, both family and friends, to cancer. Just last Thursday, I lost my uncle to stage 4 colon cancer. 3 years ago I lost my fiancé to the same cancer. So I decided to get all the cancer ribbons tattooed on my arms. I've already got the breast cancer ribbon tattooed on my left shoulder because of my grandmother losing her life to it. But I want to get all of them for everyone that has fought and either won or lost their battle. Prayers for you and your family Isabella!!! Stay strong and remember, you have ppl all over on your side. ❤❤
Father God give her strength to go through this journey. I pray for complete restoration. ❤
Such a beautiful person.  Inside and out.  Praying for ya girl!  You got this!!!❤🙏🏽

Just sad...that kids get this .Robin for one gets it😢
We laid my sister to rest on 12/28 after battling stage 2 metastatic breast cancer that progressed to stage 4. It was a long and cruel journey since 2016. To watch my little sister, a brilliant, bright, loving, forgiving, and full of life elementary teacher be reduced to someone in excruciating paid daily was torturous to watch. She fought a long a hard fight. Inspite of her health, still found the time to prepare materials for her kids, called every student’s parent to find out how they were doing. Man, my sister was selfless, she would take a different kid in every weekend and showed them love and compassion like they were her own. I’ll miss her dearly but I’m comforted by the fact that she is no longer in pain. Miss you baby girl but you’ve done your part here on earth. You made it to 43 on 12/1 and made your exit on 12/10.  I’m thankful for 43 years of being your big sister. We’ve talked and talked and laughed through so much. You can rest now.
I said a prayer for her healing. I believe shes healed in Jesus name 🙌 🙏
I am praying for the family
Praying for Isabella and all of her family. Love from Iowa
God bless Isabella & her family ❤
Thank you God for Blessing this sweet baby with your Mercy and Grace 🙏🏽🙌🏽🥲

Beautiful soul. May Allah ease her pain, comfort her and grant her long life. ❤
May the Lord Jesus restore Isabella and all children to full health. In Jesus name I pray 🙏🏻
She's a really pretty girl. I hope the best for her. Too young for this kind of problem.
S😢! They are truly amazing.  Sorry they are going through this but like he said, "She Got This". Living about 30min from Duke she will be OK 👍! She got a cheerleader right here.
Praying for your family!❤
❤🙏🏿
My son had the same tumor when he was 5. His was the size of a lemon. He did intense chemotherapy for 4 months since radiation would cause permanent brain damage at that age. He’s 8 now and is doing great! He gets regular MRIs and they’ve always come out clear. His next one is March. I pray Isabella’s chemotherapy journey is successful.
Poor baby! There is so much love there
Bless you sweet girl!  You are beautiful and strong and brave!. Sending you lots of hugs and love.
Praying for Michael Strahan's daughter and his family!!

My sister at the age of 47  had a brain tumour. The only thing that happened was that she was having seizes. Then she found out it was growing for 2 years. It had 5 fingers attached to it. In less than 2 weeks, she had surgery  They shrunk the fingers and took out some of the tumor.  It was 6 years ago. But glad  like my sister ,the doctors worked fast. Good luck with your recovery😊

Thank you for sharing your journey.  You are so brave and inspirational.  Tears of strength! Look what you have been through and came through. Next chapter, please.
I am absolutely devastated- she is to young - lost my 27 year old niece to cancer in 2022 -
Dr Campbell in the UK has just relised a new video on a new brain virus that China's "working"on right now that kills instantly. Link here:   https://youtu.be/CP4lkYS3yTM?feature=shared
I don’t have cancer but I have feelings and my heart goes out to her and her family. Her dad has been an amazing role model since I’ve known of him. So with that she will be blessed. God is in control the healing has already begun. Thank you for sharing.❤
Is it possible to have an article, obituary, discussion, news segment etc., about cancer without the associated concept of it being a "battle"? I have two, stage four, terminal cancers. I'm not special, unique, better, worse, wiser, above or below any other human being. It is not a "battle." One experiences breathtaking physical pain, certainly. It is, overwhelmingly, an extraordinarily beautiful gift (as is EACH moment of everyone's life, without exception), an opportunity for greater understanding (and yes, even joy) of our miraculous lives (if one chooses to see it that way). I would never desire that anyone experience it, however.
Beautiful brave girl
Such a good attitude. Praying for you.
Prayers for a complete recovery!🙏🏻❤️
Sending this beautiful young lady all the prayers and love & light 🙏🏼♥️💪🏼
I’m so happy that treatment for cancer is not as long as it used to be.  I had rhabdomyosarcoma when I was 13 in 1980.  Two straight years of chemo and three surgeries. Sending much love and healing energy. ❤
God Bless you, prayers for full recovery
❤❤ I took care of my sister. She had a softball sized spider cancer in her brain. She is gone now but I feel your pain ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Prayers to u all
Prayers!🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
May God Bless and heal this family
Such an amazing pretty lady. I will be praying for her and her family.
I was diagnosed with lung cancer in August 2019, at which point I was also told it had spread to my liver & I was in stage 4. Several months later my liver was clear of cancer and then it had spread to my brain. In July of last year I had surgery to remove my 2 tumors, so I can somewhat understand what Isabella is going through. I have stayed positive throughout my fight and I think it really does help.  Isabella, I would like for you to listen to Rachel Platten's song FIGHT SONG. I listen to it every day. Stay Positive dear and let's show cancer who is boss.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xo1VInw-SKc
Robin had a hard time keeping it together. So glad that this was kept private. All my prayers for GOD to step in and heal Isabella as only Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ can. We ask this in your name Jesus.
A very beautiful , and brave young lady.  Stay strong. Wishing you a speedy recovery.
Nothing else matters when your child is sick. It certainly lets you know what the important things in life are.
❤🙏🏾
Isabella we  all are praying for a speedy recovery. 🙏♥️
Back in the 1970's my aunt was diagnosed with brain cancer. The operation was BRUTAL, to say the least. The scarring was horrific. The recovery was difficult and long. The surgery bought her 10 EXCELLENT quality years of life. I am hoping & praying Isabella has many, many excellent quality years of life, ahead.
God bless you beautiful Isabella…prayers for you that you make a full recovery, you are such a brave young woman sending you warm hugs 🙏💞
Hopefully these parents will realize how much their children suffer due to their genetic outcrossing. Many of the children suffer socially, emotionally, and physically bc of their own self- H8 and/or desire to create designer babies. Honestly, he doesn’t seem to care much (little emotion)… sad but I wish her complete healing on this journey😢  Sn: I didn’t see any photos of her with her father in the hospital? Historically, has he been an active father? Where’s her mother?
Isabella you are beautiful inside and out! You've got this. Thoughts and prayers your way. Stay strong Angel 😇 🙏 Michael stay strong together the love of family will get you all through this.
Prayers sweetie hang in there its hard but you will come out the other side and help others. God has got you sometimes it maybe why me which the answer is your not alone asking that question. Your path will help others and in return will help you. Make sure once your channel is up and going make sure Dad is letting us know its up so we can follow. You got this Angle.❤
So sorry to hear.  Will pray for them
Isaiah 41:10 10 So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.🙏🏼

Wow I felt this to my core as a adult a single mom of 3 chronic illnesses at a young age college age sucks
Isabella I hate that you are going through this and I pray for you and your family. But please dont feel ashamed or embarrassed to cry. Your tears are normal human emotions. You have the weight of the world on your shoulders. Its okay to cry. In fact showing your true emotions and your fears and feelings is genuine and real. You will help others with this interview and this youtube series.
Darling girl, I got through it. I'm alive. Straight up - FCANCER! But you got this. Stay strong. Be a soldier. Just fight the war, and you will win. Brace up, put on them boxing gloves, stay as strong as you can and hang on to those who love  you. This is YOUR fight, no one else can do it. DO IT! (I, a goofy grown-ass woman, pretended I was in the Vietnam war and was surrounded by the enemy. I was silent, immovable, wouldn't scratch an itch, and refused to cry - until the fight was done - then I cried for a month, so very grateful to my family and God for saving my life.) OH - AND LOVE THOSE DOCS/TECHS/NURSES! They ROCK! You got this, beautiful!!! 💖
Prayers yo Micheal i am.prating fir Isabella

Poor Baby.  I pray she continues on the mend.
Wow! This was a tear jerker!
Michael I love you and I pray for you and your daughter.  God bless you
I’m 16 years cancer free. Also had a benign brain tumor w/ hydrocephalus but mine was an JPA ( juvenile pineal astrocytoma) when I was 9. Went thru 5 surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation. All that in a span of 7 years. I know the pain struggles! Keep going Isabella!!!
God bless you all, thank you for sharing your story with us. ❤
Isabella is going to ROCK this world, for MANY years to come 🌟.
Sorry to Mike and his daughter to go through this smh. May Allan have mercy.
We rebuke brain tumors in the Name of Christ Jesus! You are healed by the Stripes of Jesus. Thank You, LORD🙏🏾
Isabella is a brave & strong young woman! Wishing her speedy recovery full of happiness and health!

I wonder if Kelly Ripa reached out.
She is so beautiful, I love that they all are so optimistic.  I have heard that the positive attitude is a big help in recovery.  Wishing this all goes well for them all, and a very speedy recovery.  What an amazing father, the love and support that Michael is showing for Isabella shows through so strong.  I can see now why he went MIA, I knew he was a workaholic and it must have been something to do with the family.  Really wish I had been wrong.
You are beautiful, inside and out.  For forth and thrive!  Hugs.

😅😢
I hate these stupid platitudes people insist on regurgitating. At one point we hear the BS "You're never given more than you can bear" and then seconds later it's "You're not as strong as you think you are." Which is it? I'm glad she's on the mend, but spare us the crap, will you?
Good thoughts & prayers coming your way Isabella!  Duke Cancer Institute will take good care of you, my hometown of Durham, NC.
KEEP THE FAITH🔥YOU ARE BLESSED 🙏🏽 GOD'S TIMING IS PERFECT❤IF GOD TAKES YOU TO IT 🙌🏽HE WILL BRING YOU THROUGH IT ✝️ I PRAY FOR HEALING IN THE MIGHTY PRECIOUS NAME OF JESUS ❤️ AMEN
Michael should be proud, what a great young lady. I like her.
I’m proud of you Miss Isabella. I was diagnosed with stage 1 her negative breast cancer in August 2014 a day after my 50th birthday. The treatment was grueling at the time. I worked 10 hour days and did my treatment which included biopsies, surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation.   You are a trooper from what I’ve just watched on GMA with your story with Robin Roberts. Your medical team, family and friends are amazing. Thank you for documenting your journey for all the world to see.  Your youth is a blessing to help you through it all. I’m a Christian so, my faith in God got me through then and now. I’m still feeling the aftermath from the treatment but I’m cancer free and very much alive.   I rang the bell in September 2015. I wish you well and will keep you and all people diagnosed with any disease that changes your life forever. Thank you for your beautiful spirit and even more lovely bravery to share your thoughts and unplanned ride with us all. 👏🏾❤️👌🏾
❤❤❤ I feel for this patients . Young , beautiful …… And them “ Cancer “ I just light up a candle for everyone out there including animals with cancer . Today a YouTuber is having a massive tumor remove . 😂❤ . Everything will be ok .
This breaks my heart...I am a cancer survivor of Ovarian Cancer. All I can say is be Prayerful, Hopeful, Joyful, Positive, Grateful, & never Negative. God is with you.
Jeremiah 29:11 is a scripture that says, “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.” I declare in Jesus name that this will only be a test in her testimony for nothing formed against her shall prosper!! In Jesus name I declare, Amen.
Michael my heart goes out. My prayers goes out! She is beautiful and may God grant her the strength to go through this and prevail 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 sending my prayers!!!!

Warriors with Tender Hearts 💕 ... She is such a powerful inspiration for all who are going through traumatic journeys.  "I send to you an Angel 😇 to guide You by Your Way".   SHALOM (Peace and Freedom) always.

Thank you so much for sharing your story. Your bravery and strength is and will be so inspiring to so many people. I sadly lost my 14 year old cousin back in June to this horrendous disease. You should be so proud of the strong, beautiful young lady that you are. Please keep fighting and sharing your cancer journey. Sending all my prayers.
Yes Baby you GOT this 🙏💕
Sending love and prayers to you and your family 😘💞🙏🏻
Oh man, my two sisters had & have Glioblastoma. It’s very scary thing to have to watch your family members go through cancer.
Why don't cancer people just get on with it no one wants to know
Did Isabella have the cancer causing cov19 injection??
Sending prayers , keep 💪 you will get through this.❤
Praying for your complete healing Isabella.  Prayers for the family as they battle this disease along side their daughter and sister.  Sending hugs.
Not just an inspiration .she's a vessel of God and she is showing her wings .so brave at such a young age . She will show the world that miracles are possible . Stand strong little Angel . I will be praying God wraps his wings around you and holds you up.
What a beautiful young lady she is
Omg… she has grown so much. I remember when she and her sister use to cook with their dad online.  You got this Isabella!  Sending love and prayers,❤❤❤
Turbo cancers popping up everywhere since the (cough cough) vax!   Don’t believe me? Listen to Bret Weinstein discuss it.
Isabella, you will be on my daily prayer list. Fight on!!
poor baby and what a wonderful father.  Makes you realise, don't moan about stupid things !!!
God bless you Isabella 🙏🏿
Praying that Lord covers this family and heals this child and all those fighting this disease. Let a cure be revealed in the name of Jesus1
She is beautiful.  She has the most amazing smile.  Sending you all love, light, strength, and prayers.  She’s got this..  ❤❤❤.  Unfortunately, it is probably the hardest thing as a parent to watch your child go through any kind of illness and you just wish you could take it from them.
I’ve been through Surgery, Chemotherapy & Radiation so I can understand her struggle…but let’s be honest about why this was put out there.…her telling her story is all about public relations and promoting a YouTube channel 🙄 Media manipulation and white lies I hate them. I wish her well , a speedy healing and quick recovery.
The beauty of sisterhood. She told her sis first 😭
Isabela you are a  start 🌟
She is BEAUTIFUL! 🤍 her strength and bravery is inspiring
7:10 But what?
Ppl were being So shady to him when he wasn't on the show-- saying all kinds of nasty things! Then you find out that he is dealing with this?! I hope all those people talking crap feel terrible for it! Poor girl, so brave!!
She’s so beautiful. Godbless her
God Bless ❤
I send you good loving vibes from France . You are so precious. Pascale
Prayers 🙏 🙏 ❤
Beautiful girl prayers God bless u
I just wonder if she took that covid shot because it seems to be making a lot of people very very sick
God Bless
I am very very touched by this but then there are thousands that don't have a famous father to bring it to light. Other than his NFL career I can't stand listening to him. Him and Steve Harvey are about as funny as diarrhea.
Isabella, is so very brave during such a scary and painful situation. She's such a warrior, has such a kind heart and what a wonderful way to kick back at Cancer. Thank you for coming forth to share the journey. Sending good thoughts and prayers during this difficult journey to her and her family. May she soon be Cancer free and able to live a long, healthy and happy life!
This has got to be the most beautiful family. Micheal  still looks so young.❤
Prayers to Isabella and anyone fighting an illness. May your health improve and your body grow stronger.  You are a child of The Most High God, remember that.
❤❤🙏🙏
Continue prayers and blessings 💕
The devil is a liar, had ovarian cancer in 2002 December 17th, my faith in God kept me when the  doctors were telling my husband otherwise. We hang in  there with God, he is the healer. I did not have any chemotherapy or radiation, but the removal of my ovaries. I am still  here. Wont God do it? Yes he will. This young lady is going to be just fine, pray and keep the faith. God bless.
What helped me after my breast cancer diagnosis and treatments is faith and trust in Jesus.  Keep your faith in Jesus sweet young lady. Live in faith and one day at a time.  Two years no evidence of cancer.  One day at a time. All because of Jesus mercy and grace.  I pray for all the healthcare team and facility teams that keep everything clean.  I just pray and praise God all the time.
No, you need Jesus in your life. 😊
My heart is with Michael and daughter, I have just been through a journey with my daughter and her breast cancer….love and healing sent!
You cannot imagine what they are going through ❤😅.
I couldn’t help but cry. Isabella is such a beautiful strong young lady. I am praying for her full recovery. As a parent I feel even more for Mr. Strahan. I am lifting the entire family up in prayer.🙏🏽

Michael's a good dad. Isabella is justifiably scared but she's strong & has the love & support of family & friends. Kids & young adults should never have to deal with something like this. It just isn't fair. Sending up prayers for courage & healing .✨
I love you beautiful!!!!  Keep standing strong!!!!!
God bless her and heal her entirely.❤
Girl I needed this cry or something. I cried so bad watching this. My grandmother suffered from 3 different cancers. When God gives u a chance to live after something so serious, it really changes your perspective. Couldn’t agree more ❤

I am so humble by this news.  I am not a fan of Michaels, but I have lived this experience with my younger brother who unfortunately transitioned in 2001.
🙏🙏🙏❤️
God is fighting her battles my brother, when it comes to sickness I don’t believe in any shame because someone else could be facing the same thing. Correction my brother God save her life he decided who stay  and who goes he gives mankind knowledge to think.

Running your body on carbs(glucose) instead of fats(ketones) promotes cancer and tumors. All the normies run on glucose that’s why Cancer is getting more and more common. They might end up becoming extinct.
Now that’s a father!   God bless them both! Amazing story thank you for reporting, Robin.

Dear Isabella, I just came across your story on YouTube. My name is Derrick Winn. I am a father of twin girls. As I sit here writing you this text message can only think of my own two children. They are 25 years old and they are the joy of, their mother and my life. A father‘s job is to protect his children so I can only imagine the strain on your father‘s heart. I just want you to know that God has a plan he’s in control and you are to never stop trusting and believing in him. I’m praying for you. I’m praying for your twin sister as well. I know she’s deeply affected . keep your head up keep working hard God bless you.

wishing you folks the best
So many people getting cancer…
My prayers are up for this young lady👩🏽‍🦱🥲🥲
Thanks for sharing and will keep you guys in my prayers
So sad.  I’m praying for y’all ❤️
she's lucky her family has money, not everyone can afford or even get this treatment quick.
I have lost 3 very dear people to Glioblastoma. They fought very hard and lived about 18 months with surgery and aggressive treatment - radiation and chemo. I wish Isabella the very best and I hope there is viable treatment for her type of brain cancer. It’s not immediately clear which type of brain cancer she has. This is tragic. Hang on. We all care. I’m sending love and huge healing wishes.
Whew....my Lord.....YOU GOT THIS ISABELLA🎉🎉
Sending so much love and hugs! You have such a wonderful support group! You GOT THIS! 🙏🙏
Thank You Lord Jesus Christ Amen ❤️🙏🙏🙏❤️✝️👑🩸🩸🩸🔥🔥🔥👏👍💪💪💪💪💐💐💐💐🌸🌻🌷🌹🖐️🖐️💯
Michael Strahan has so much class.  My prayers are with Isabella and family.  She's got the right attitude to kick this in the butt.  You go girl!

I just can't imagine. What you a going through My prayers are with you and your family  🙏.
Beauty-Full Story🙏🏽 May Healing Come Forth... ✨Give Thanks for GOOD MEDICINE✨
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 for her healing asking God to remove the cancer with a full recovery ❤️‍🩹 ❤
Hi Michael and GMA family, watching this from your daughter being tears to my eyes she is strong and beautiful may God continue to strengthen and blessed her throughout this chapter in her life.
Sending prayers and love to Isabella and the entire Strahan family.
And she simply wants to go back to school, to be a regular 19YO.  We take so much for granted.  When she talked about the difficulty of finding just 1 person with her same diagnosis, I imagined that was her motivation to reach out through social media. I never knew Michael was an ambassador for St. Jude's - it was the favorite charity of my best friend, who I lost to multiple myeloma the day after Christmas. I will say my final goodbye to her in two days and I don't know how I'll get through it. Every day, get a reminder like this to stop pushing down my pain and let myself cry. I almost couldn't watch this because I didn't know her prognosis, but I'm glad I did.
Praying for her 🙏🏽
Praying for Isabella,God got you,trust him,have Faith
Thanks for sharing your story.  Keep smiling♥️♥️♥️♥️
I wish to Michael’s daughter a quick recovery. The good thing is that Isabella is just 19, and the attitude on young people is always positive.
All the best to your daughter Michael. Your family as well!🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻♥️♥️♥️
Gods got you Isabella,keeping you in Gods favor,Praying for you! Tearfully, you will be okay! 💐💐💐Stay strong, Stay Safe!
Praying for her!!!!!🙏🏽
I don’t see why this is news……
I thank God that she shared, now more of us can pray on her behalf ❤️‍🩹
Sending lots of love & prayers..
I do not understand why celebrities put these type of things out in the public.  They mention how they were "able to keep it private for so long" and then suddenly decided to "own it" and do a huge GMA interview, why?  I just don't get it.  This poor girl.  Maybe this is just the way it is with people who need to be the center of attention, but as her father, I feel Michael Strahan should have protected his daughter and not put this pressure on her instead of using her as some kind of cancer survivor inspiration story while she is literally in the midst of fighting the battle of her young life.  Repeatedly he said she will "be an inspiration for others" and other remarks like that,  but that's an awful lot of pressure to put on this girl who is going through cancer of her own while she needs to be focused on her own healing, not to mention the state of her own mental health.   Maybe she is all for this press tour (she's done interviews on several channels that I've seen) and decided to do this herself, maybe she was encouraged to do it by her celebrity family members, who knows, all I know is that the girl is in a horribly vulnerable state in her young life and it's a real shame to see her weeping and getting emotional about what her life used to be like all while her father sits next to her allowing the world to gawk at her while she falls apart.  Something about that is very, very wrong.
She is a strong young lady.
Prayers to you both!🙏🏾🙏🏾
I'M So Glad To See She's human & can cry because so many people say be strong do not Cry.!!! So darling, you touched my heart because i cried with you !!! In my prayers you will be.. 🙏❤️💯🤗
I'm a 62 y.o. mom/grandma.  I had no idea Mr. Strahan and his family were experiencing this. Immediately, I came to this channel to watch the entire video. I was left speechless and was in shock.  So, I began to simply read the comments to heal and help ME because I followed this man and family so much, so I kept wondering where he was at.  I wasn't seeing him around as much and today I now know why.  First, Thank You YT community for all of your beautiful and encouraging words that you all shared as I couldn't until now. To the Strahan family,  Thank You for sharing with us. Isabella  sweety,  this too shall pass baby. Thank You for allowing us, the world, to continually keep our prayers going not only for you but for others going through times such as these. We/I love you Family, in God's name we trust. Blessings to you all, AMEN!
You go girl! You got this ❤!
This story really touched my heart because it hits home personally. I cried through the whole video and still crying as I am typing. My brother, although not as young as Isabella (he’s 40) late summer, early Fall 2023 started complaining of problems with his hip. He went to his family doctor only to be told that he had a hip sprain, given some pain medication to take, but no testing was done. The pain temporarily went away but quickly reoccurred. He went back to the doctor and asked the doctor if it was something else going on and the doctor at that point decided to order an MRI not right away but sometime in January 2024. My sister came home to take my nephew to a follow up appointment at Duke on Dec. 18, 2023 so that I wouldn’t have to miss another day out of work because 1 year ago today, he lost his mother (our oldest sister) in death. When they returned, my sister noticed that my brothers left leg was swollen, she told him that wasn’t normal and that she was taking him to the ER. He was there in the local hospital all night and most of Tuesday, Dec. 19th until about 3:30 pm when ECU Health finally came to transport him to their hospital. After arriving, they immediately began their own testing, from Ultrasounds, to CT scans, and an MRI. We are thankful that his MRI came back good, but unfortunately, he was diagnosed with late stage 3 early stage 4 B-Cell Lymphoma Cancer. He has a mass almost 4 inches big on his left side in his pelvic area which has blocked the blood & fluid flow from his upper body to his lower body thus causing the swelling. The cancer has eaten away part of his pelvic bone which was causing the pain in what he thought initially was hip pain. In addition, the CT scan showed a tumor under each arm, 1 in his chest, and 1 in his back. He has finished up his 1st round of chemotherapy and will be starting the 2nd round of treatment this coming Thursday. Right now, he’s bedridden due to the swelling in his leg and the deteriorated pelvic bone because the doctors don’t want him putting pressure on his left side because he risk the chance of falling and breaking the bone as well as his hip. After 3 - 4 rounds of chemotherapy treatment, another CT scan will be done to see what the cancer looks like (hoping & praying that it will be gone). If the cancer cells are gone, he will have 2 more rounds of treatment and begin talking with the orthopedic doctor to determine next steps as it pertains to repairing his pelvic bone.   Although my brother’s cancer is different from Isabella’s, I think just hearing the “C” word makes you feel a certain kind of way. Just watching my brothers unwavering faith and strength has given me strength as one of his older sisters whose been right by his side. Isabella, your strength is amazing and I appreciate you sharing your story.  As we are going through this difficult time in our family ourselves, please know Michael and Isabella that we will keep you all in our thoughts and prayers too so that you can also have a speedy recovery. Wishing you well and much success on this journey!
Watching this I don’t know where Robin got the strength to held back the tears.  Be strong Isabella God got this

She can thank Phizer for her cancer. The Covid Vaccine or Bio Weapon was most likely to blame.

Beautiful life, live, love, left hand turns. Indeed they yield beautiful joy! Authorsandranorthard
I cried a thousand tears watching this interview. Isabella is a true champion 🏆 She knew that by sharing her cancer journey, it would be more beneficial than keeping it secret. It's call giving hope while setting a great example.  She is human, and tears shows that she is strong. It takes a strong person to share such a private story with the world.   Isabella, I am rooting for you. As a cancer survivor, I know what you are going through. We are praying for a full recovery 🙏 🎉🎉🎉
❤😢
Praying for you that the tumor is destroyed and never to return again!!  In Jesus name Amen!
God , praying for your total recovery dear girl. My heart goes out to you.. cancer survivor here. Hope you feel better soon❤
I'm so proud of Isabella! She is so strong, and I pray for her continued recovery. I'm glad she shared her story.💙
Whew chile...I've always loved this man... his personality and professionalism. This interview with his daughter almost took me out😥😢😭!!! So, I can only imagine what kind of strength it took him as a father to be strong for her and to be strong for her as she continues to recover. I am a mother. My son is 24. Being a parent is the hardest role job in the world, because as a parent, you literally want to protect your child from all pain and suffering. Unfortunately, that's not how life works😥😢😭. So, all you can do is keep them prayed up and ask God for His grace and mercy upon their lives. I pray a full recovery for this young lady and that she will have a long healthy life full of joy, happiness, laughter, and prosperity in Jesus' name🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾, and I pray that God will continue to strengthen her parents and siblings as they continue to support her in Jesus' name I pray, Amen🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤❤❤❤
From Canada, my wife had similar symptoms 3 years ago. Drove her to the hospital. She had a scan of her brain. Later that day, doctor told us she had a tumour the size of a golf ball in the middle of her brain. I almost vomited. Doctor said to come back the next day to meet the neurologist. Next day, neurologist looked at the scan and said it’s a meningioma, a non cancerous brain tumour. Size was 2,3 cm. He said she could live with the tumour as it would grow by 1 mm per year. My wife decided to get it removed. Got a surgery to remove the tumour, a 9 hour long surgery. She doing fine now. Thanks to the brain surgeon, a real artist. Both of you are so courageous and thank you for sharing. Of course, I wish the best to your beautiful daughter. ❤
Sending so much love to the Strahan family ❤️ you got this Isabella
Wishing her a full recovery. ❤😢
Isabella you are so beautiful and strong. Thanks for sharing your story. You are such a an inspiration ❤️. I have found a lump on my breast. getting a mammogram and sonogram done in 2 weeks and the thought of it being cancer scares me so much. I'm praying is nothing. Cancer sucks.
Get well soon, I will keep you in my prayers ❤
Wishing her a speedy recovery.
God bless this young lady.  Heal her in the name of Jesus
Isabella is a strong, beautiful amazing young woman inside and out!  I’m sending my best and deepest thoughts and prayers to her!
So did they remove the cancerous tumor from the back of her brain or no? I didn't even know that was possible to remove.

I am terribly sorry that she is going through this. I had a one in a million cancer, and I made it. Chemo had only been around a handful of years, and there was only a handful of "poisons" at the time. Take heart, the body and mind is a tremendous thing. It won't seem like it at times but you are in charge.
God bless...I'm so sorry...praying

I love you Isabella. You are strong.❤❤❤❤
Get well soon  God bless this family please
My mom mom passed away 5 months after stage 4 gbm brain cancer diagnosis 😞I hate cancer.  Prayers for her healing and recovery.
Such a sweet girl. ❤❤Michael Strahan is blessed that his sports career and personality got him into a top media position with both the income and the public support and access to give his daughter the BEST care so she can survive. Unfortunately working class and middle class kids don’t get diagnosed fast enough and have to jump through hoops and treatment denials. This segment shows that all people should receive this level of medical care in the US.
Very touching
I’m praying for you Isabella. God is good. God bless you ❤️✝️🤍
Whew the tears thank you for sharing your story Praying for you Princess and thanking God in advance for healing you You look so Beautiful with your haircut 😍😍❤️🙏🏼

Sending prayers and angels for Micheal Strahan's daughter to be protected and cured.
I will be praying for he and the family. My daughter was diagnosed with liver cancer at the age of 23 she had three small children. She's been a cancer survivor for 17 years.
PRAYERS GOING UP!
❤God Bless You, and Your Family ❤Your strength is amazing sweetheart. Thank You for sharing your journey. You will help others! You truly are amazing!
This has me weeping. Stay strong Mr Strachan for Isabella.  It is clear for all to see that you are an amazing father and male figure. Isabella we are all proud of you and you will be all right and back to your studies very soon. Stay strong and all the best
she’s so incredibly strong and brave for telling her story to the world. sending her positive vibes and love. Isabella you’ve got this 🤍
Quit being a Google doctor, don't just wash over your kids complaints when your kids dont complain much. Just go see a doctor.
YAHAWAH, grant the Strahans the wisdom required to live, learn, and to grow and counsel others. Personally, this reminds me of all the young babies and children battling cancer at the Fred Hutch Cancer Care Alliance in Seattle, WA. Those children strengthened me during my elective procedure to cure Sickle Cell Anemia.
No child deserves cancer 😢 prayers for all of them.
😢❤
Prayers up for Isabella 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Praying for a full recovery.  God bless you 🙏
God Bless this young beautiful daughter and her family 🙏🙏🙏
GOD BLESS the STRAHAN family! ❤❤❤
Stay strong 💓💓
Isabella is a very strong and absolutely beautiful woman. Talking about it is part of the healing and recovering process. This tumor does not have you and your knowledge can  inspire so many people that they are not alone and to fight the good fight of faith. Me and my family's thoughts and prayers will be with you during this portion of your chapter. ❤🌹🙏💕
Hope u have a speedy recovery and be in good health!!
Love to this beautiful family…. I am in tears… Love and courage and beauty is shining from their faces….

I live 20 minutes from Duke Children's Hospital and have witnessed first-hand the miracles that happen  there every day. Isabella is in the best hands possible for her treatment and recovery. Praying for Isabella, your family and for the miracle-workers at Duke as you wait to hear the words "cancer free".  Michael, sometimes we DO hvae more than we can handle- THAT is why we have each other.
Prayers and blessings for a good healthy outcome 🙏..sweet lady ❤
❣❣❣🙏🙏🙏
What courage!!!! She will make such a difference because of her platform…. Not being ashamed or scared to hide it. 🫡🫡🫡
Nothing is too hard for GOD!LORD I ask that YOU would heal Michaels daughter Isabella. I curse that brain tumor to the root and command it to eradicate.  By JESUS stripes she is healed and made whole.  LORD YOU sent YOUR WORD to heal her.  LORD I ask that YOU would breathe on her now.  The same spirit that resurrected JESUS I ask that YOU resurrecte her brain.  LORD I ask that YOU would give her and the family peace and wrap YOUR loving arms around her.  I ask these blessings in JESUS MATCHLESS NAME.
🙏 prayers to her and the whole family. What a brave and courageous young woman. Thank you for sharing your story 😅 . Life is so precious and short take time to tell your loved ones you love 💕 them as much as you can. Enjoy the day , God bless
God Bless your daughter! She is so strong and beautiful! My prayers are with you.
Praying for the family.  This is unfair, why them.  Sometimes I don't understand. God help their family and help me to understand! Gb!
I am sorry to hear about her diagnosis! My daughter was also diagnosed with a rare brain tumor at age 11 many years, during that time only 30 people with her diagnosis were recorded at Sloan Kettering in NYC! Keep on helping others, that will be part of your healing journey. Radiation and Chemotherapy are difficult but God has you in his hands! You are such a courageous young Lady! Thank you for shedding a light on brain cancer in children! Praying for you to have quick recovery!
You all are beautiful. My cousin and her daughter both had brain tumors and are doing great years later! ❤
Prayers for every good thing and complete healing for Isabella ❤️‍🩹

Isabella you hang in there we are praying for you sweetheart❤, you got this have faith baby. We love you.
11 yrs ago I was diagnosed with a very aggressive breast cancer.   Year2012 started with a biopsy on Jan 5.  I had surgery to remove the tumor, 33 sessions of radiation which caused severe scars on the inside of the breast, then 6 treatments of chemotherapy at 5-6 hours spaced 3 weeks apart.  Lost my hair and refused to wear a wig.  First 2 treatments I was positive that would kill me.   With my daughter’s help, I changed my diet to eating completely healthy.   That changed everything.  Didn’t lose anymore weight,  was able to continue serving lunch 1 day a week.  Also went on vacation to Tennessee after 3rd treatment and went whitewater rafting.    Still cancer free.  Prayers for Isabella and her family
Beautiful story! Thanks for sharing 🩷🙏🏽🙏🏽
Blessings to you Isabella ! Such amazing strength!! Prayers !!
God be with you to fight this and bless you
My prayers are with you through this journey for a speedy recovery 🙏🏾
This isn't the first time for her either
God , you are mighty! prepare her journey only you can, she will WIN in Jesus name! Stay grounded beautiful young woman, YOU ARE HERE TO STAY! Keeping the rest of the family in prayers, cause it's not easy for all involved.
I envy the people who can cry. I was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer last year had surgery, chemo, going on to radiation. No tears. Did feel like I was having a nervous breakdown though. Tears are your best friend. Embrace when it shows up. The alternative is a lot more difficult to bear. This child is so young. Sending every Ounce of hope her way.
🙁. Bless God they moved swiftly. Thank God for the vomiting of blood because that's what signaled 'Get help NOW!"
Bless you baby girl. Sending Blessings and Prayers to you and your family.
Sending prayers and hugs to you guys 🙏❤️
❤❤
What a brave, beautiful and amazing young woman.  Sending good thoughts and love her way.  I have always been a fan of Michael.  I feel so bad for what he is going through.  Wishing him and his daughter the best.

I found myself sobbing watching this.  F Cancer.  No kids, no one should ever go through this.  It’s so wonderful she can smile and wants to help other people through all her pains and struggles.  I hope she gets well.
Praying for you sweet Isabella. You are so strong. I went through this hearing that my daughter had Cancer. She beat it like you will. Love and admire you MIchael. Thank you Robin Robert’s, awesome you.
Prayers are with you Michael 🙏 ❤
My Heartfelt Prayers are Conveyed to lift up Isabella and Michael Strahan and Family throughout their journey 🙏 ❤❤❤❤
Wow! What an amazing young lady!
My brother passed away 2 years ago from the same thing same age too. I don’t think is rare anymore
This interview was powerful!  It quickly puts in perspective how quickly life can change, how important family and good friends are and being resilient.  I have admired Michael Strahan's daughters even as little girls.  To see Isabella strength as a young adult and her ability to fight this disease with such grace brought me to tears!  Thank you for sharing and reminding us what life is all about.  Godspeed!
Praying for your family!!!
As a lifelong Giants fan, prayers for Big 92 and Isabella. 💙🙏

She’s so strong and definitely has her dad’s smile😊❤
I'm so sorry💔 So devastating.  I have been walking through intense intense sickness and that grief of disbelief and fear, it is overwhelming.  The reality of what life really is is heavy. I hope she makes it through ❤ Thank you for sharing your story
She's such a sweet soul. She will get through this. ❤
Praise God 🤲🤲for your healing  as you go through this process with chemotherapy.  I'm praying for  you and your family 🙏🙏🙏 and  know that God has already worked it out.  Be strong and courageous.
Beautiful Young Woman!  My Youngest Daughter was treated at Duke also.  They’re great!  Stay encouraged.
She is stunning  Isabella we are all praying for you
I feel for her so much. She’s very inspiring and has a great support system. I can’t wait until she is able to get back to college. In the meantime it’s great that she’s willing to educate others about what she is going through.
❤️❤️
All the best to her, and her family. Beautiful strong girl.  Sorry this happened to her...
Thankfully, she was seen quickly. I assume she went to a neurologist because of the balance issue. It is difficult to see any specialist quickly. I’m glad she did, was diagnosed, had surgery and is undergoing treatment, Praying for her recovery and no reoccurrence.
🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏
Praying for Isabella❤ GOD BLESS THE WHOLE FAMILY ❤
Headaches are never a good sign!
God bless her.
God is good, know he has you amen senior
She is wonderful good thoughts and wishes,and Dad your stronger than you think you are,he gives the biggest challenges to his stronger people.
That’s wonderful. We are so proud of her. She’s such a lovely and strong young woman. I remember when Michael was absent from GMA for a few weeks and it was referred to as a person matter. Wow. Life, health is certainly fragile.
God bless her! Praying for your complete healing🙏🏽
God bless Isabella and may he grant her the courage and strength to go through her treatment. Prayers for healing🙏

God bless Isabella and the whole family. I pray for the families hope, joy, strength, and healing in Jesus name. Her sister is right just keep living and persevering.

It is inspiring to see a teenager use her struggle and pain for a greater purpose. Go beautiful Isabella❤ .
Thank God!.  You know I pray that Jesus will be there for you every step of the way. Holy Spirit lead her. God is our healer. He heals Supernaturally.

I’m crying watching this and I wish you all the best in your recovery 🥰 I’m a 26 year cancer survivor and please know that everyday that you go through treatment is one day closer to coming out the other side and to getting better and somewhat closer to a normal life. It doesn’t feel like it now but it will get better. I’m praying for you on our journey to recovery.
May the Angels of comfort and healing hover close. ❤

All the best to the family and the lovely Isabella… keep strong.
Why does this make me angry?  Not at her, but at the rumors and innuendo of Michaels absences from GMA.  The speculation of infighting or Michael is a prima dona.....just shows that truth is stronger than any fiction.  Bless Isabella and the Strahan family.
Beautiful testimony...  Thank you for sharing and like many I will be praying for this beautiful young woman...🙏🏾❤
💪
Sending this beautiful girl all the healing energy in this world ♥️ Big prayers to their family ♥️
omg wow so thats why he was absent from the show dang man 😟

Michael Strahan, you are a lot stronger than you think. Your daughter is definitely going to push through because you’re there for her. Everyone, please support St. Jude’s Children Cancer Research Hospital. 💕💕💕🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️💜💜💜
Sending prayers to her
Prayer for a quick recovery!!
I’m a head and neck cancer survivor 18 months in remission. Scary stuff but we do recover
Praying for you both Michael and Isabella.  Michael  you were missed from GMA and Fox NFL  for weeks last year and many of your fans were hoping that all was well with you and were happy to see you back on both programs. However, now to see what you and Isabella were experiencing, and continue to deal with makes me admire you even  more. Isabella has handled this with so much grace, and humility. Michael you protected Isabella throughout this process with so much strength and so much love. I believe that she will come through this and that God will continue to bless her.
As a 24 year old who just a year ago when through hodgkins lymphoma i thank you for sharing your story during your fight. The mental battle of being a young adult with cancer is gut wrenching. 4 months of chemo is not easy for me and ik youll get through it. For me at least the remission at first was the hardest. I now am in a much better place and know your family will be too.
Sending the Strahan family and your daughter prayers and positive vibes (my heart goes out to her).🙏🏽🙏🏽
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Happy she's telling the world her symptoms and what to look for❤❤❤❤❤❤thank you.  She's beautiful
❤ 🙏🏽🙌🏾
Just beautiful, you got this Isabella and prayers from Mid Michigan.
Prayers for Isabella, Michael and the entire family as she goes through the process. God cover and keep her 🙏❤️
Isabella, thank you for sharing your story. You are so loving and selfless to give others encouragement through your youtube videos even through this difficult time. When I had cancer I found videos of people sharing their story  helpful. I really appreciate Michaels honesty & great humility to share how he needs support and community too. My prayers are with you🙏
What a lovely young woman.  She is handling this illness with grace and dignity!🙏🏼
This tore me up. I have lost two Cousin's to Brain Cancer. They both at least at the time of diagnosis were inoperable. So we unfortunately lost them both. So I can understand how you all must be feeling. My heart and blessings go out to you. #fcancer
I’m balling. She is such a great girl. And it’s true, it would drop me to my knees if it were my child. I’m praying for her quick recovery. Gob D blesses her. Stay strong sweet heart, you got this.
Man God Bless her and her entire family 🥺❤️‍🩹I pray God blesses her with a full recovery and a long healthy life ❤

OH LAWD 😢 such a young girl, for this to happen to. back when M.S was dealing with a family situation i thought it was his elderly mom. (m.s is the youngest of 6 kids)
omg 💔
Being a SURVIVOR 3 times your emotions are all over the place ❤😂 his courage was like my mums when I was SO ANGRY 💯🥹🥹

You got this boo❤ praying for you and your family ❤️ wishing nothing but the best for you💪🏾💜 you got this beautiful 😍
Whilst going through chemotherapy treatment the hardest part was seeing young people in the ward with me, going through the same or even worse cases than myself, but they were all so brave. I wish this young lady a quick recovery and a long life and also the same to anyone going through illness or hardships.
Another reason to love Strahan.  Praying for this beautiful young lady.
What amazing young woman  sending a lot of love
Speedy recovery!!!  Prayers.
Hang tight! You got this!!❤️
The vaccine injured are getting turbo cancers at an astronomical rate. People, stop getting the Covid vaccine and boosters and look into what’s in all the other vaccines that didn’t used to be!! Pfizer is making money off of this, from TAXPAYERS. LOTS of it. Time to sue the ever loving shit out of them.
Michael I am praying for you and your daughter I am hoping that she gets better I'm praying for her recovery I love you Michael Strahan ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏
Beautiful young lady
They should give ger the whole tissue box not one piece of tissue

Best wishes and prayers for you Isabelle. Michael said no one should ever get that call. I was there when my daughter was diagnosed at 18 months old. She had a blood disorder which is now classified as a cancer. We lost her at 3 1/2 years old. Her name is Maddie and I miss her so much. Feb 1st will be 22 years.
You could see Robin being so affected by this story. She held the space for Isabella and Michael so well. Praying for Isabella.
🙏🙏🙏
Oh,, Michael, you have learned that you ARE stronger than you think you are.   You're strong enough to let others help you. You're strong enough to be in the moment for Isabella. You're strong enough to help Isabella tell her story. You're strong enough to be Isabella's safe place to fall. You're strong enough to help build supports for others. You're strong enough to let Isabella take the lead.  And Isabella, thank you for telling your story  Because of you, someone will not ignore that "different" headache. Because of you, doctors will learn more about brain tumors and their treatments. Because of you, someone will survive. The world is changed by your example. Thank you for being brave enough to start the ripples in the pond.
Wow what an amazing beautiful young lady God bless you and your family through this tough journey ! God bless you I will have you in my prayers . Keep strong !!  Your tears touched my heart baby girl you’ve got this ! The power of prayer is strong
God Bless this young lady and her family. Don’t hesitate to depend on your family and friends. They need to be there for you just like you will need them. Be brave , but at times allow yourself to cry. 🙏🏾❤️
Watching your child try to be strong like an adult, amazingly beautiful, but still very sad 😢❤
God speed on your recovery Isabella 🥰🥰
May God continue to touch this beautiful young lady with HIS healing power in Jesus name.  ✝️🛐
I hope she has a speedy recovery, stay strong
Sending so many prayers to you and your family.🙏🏻♥️😇
So proud of her got me in tears praying for her and others that are going through this.
Wow that poor kid. You are essentially forced to expose yourself just because your dad is famous.
Oh, my.  So sad that Isabella has to go thru this.  This is hard for any family to go thru no matter who you are or what you do.
I know that we do not know each other BUT I send to you and your family tons of hugs and kisses and love !! I know where all of your hearts are right now !!!  My husband went through 2 different types of cancer!! 2nd cancer he went through 2 months of radiation and three months, wearing a feeding tube in his stomach!! So far so good the Dr.’s are taking very Good care of him!!’ I thank the dr.’s and nursing staff !!! EVERYDAY!!! He really listens to his dr.’s and may GOD shower you with life and all that makes life good !!! Bless you !!👏🏿👊👍🏿🙌🏼🎈⭕️❌💖🥰🎈🎈
What a ray of light she is.
Dear Isabella, You are such a strong young woman, love your smile. I went through the cancer experience with father and mother. Yes, they both had cancer during my teenage time. My mother had 4 times different kind of cancer operations in the past, she still jokes about that she got 4 different friends in her life and they did some drawing on her body (Operation scar). Sending you some love.
I can't even begin to imagine how terrified she is, but she's a fighter! Putting herself out there like this will help someone else who's suffering and make them feel less alone (I don't have cancer and never have, but I do have TN which is a rare chronic pain condition that doesn't have a cure and when I'm in agony and feeling so incredibly alone I visit forums for people who have the same condition as me and it always makes me feel better to know that I'm NOT the only one suffering and getting advice on how to deal and then doling out my own advice on how I deal with it). This interview brought me to tears! You can beat it!
😭😭😭😭😭
This breaks my heart 😢
I know his heart is silently breaking for her, I can tell he's Fighting away tears. Parents are shields for their children, then they go away to themselves and drop the walls down and cry!
Prayers for the entire family. Isabella is a strong young lady
Prayers for the family and appreciate Michael Strahan respectfully allowing his daughter Isabella share her story when she was ready. All the best in the days ahead.🪷
God bless her strength ❤
Amazing young lady and dad you’re awesome. Continued prayers for speedy recovery 🙏🤪🤪
My heart goes out to her and her family! Praying that all will be well.
I loved what Michael said.  She is so lucky to have a wonderful dad and supportive family.
You are absolutely beautiful Isabella!!!  Keep that fight like your Dad!!  You got this girl.  Prayers and love!
Isabella, you represent strength, courage, and love, among many other qualities.  ❤   The very fact that you are sharing your story, shows that you are a shining light to others.  You are resilient.  You are Brave.  There’s nothing more stronger than helping others, while going through our own pain.  I know that you have already touched so many hearts with your story and you will continue to be an inspiration to so many.   God is a Healer and He’s going to restore and heal you physically, emotionally, and mentally.  Don’t give up and remember to always be the beautiful person that you are.  Laugh when you want to and don’t be afraid to cry if you need to.  Sending love and prayers your way and also to your family.  You are Blessed.  I’ll be following your journey and cheering for you.  You got this.  ❤😊
Interesting how her mother is never in the public eye speaking with her children.
This breaks my heart such a beautiful and brave girl. Stay strong and fight. You have lovely father and sister!!! ♥️🙏
Isabella you're beautiful, and deserve all that is good in the world.  Like Robin said, you are rocking that bald head.  Absolutely stunning.
I'm very sorry my beautiful 27yr old daughter charley passed away from a very aggressive breast cancer on 11/23/19...an it was to say the very least gut wrenching. I pray for your beautiful daughter to beat this terrible disease bless you all
Keep strong my bother god never give us anything than we can’t take, your daughter is going to pull through this.  God is in control🙏🙏🙌🤗😍😊
What a duo. ❤ Isabella, I pray you will be healed. You’ve got the best support team surrounding you.

🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Thank you for sharing.
Cancer is an evil disease and it's particularly tragic when it chooses to strike a person so young and is just really beginning to start a new chapter of her life. My mom was diagnosed with cancer at 48 after she started experiencing abnormal bleeding on her ovaries which later turned out to be a tumor that required immediate attention and treatment. She ended up passing away from it in 2016 just weeks shy of her 50th birthday and going through an experience like that affects you for the rest of your life as we are approaching 8 years without her and not a day goes by that i don't wish she was still here or how badly i miss her . Stay strong Isabella you will have the support of your folks by your side to help you get through this. America is rooting for you to get better
I was diagnosed at age 3 years old with rare childhood cancer, Rhabdomyosarcoma(vaginal cancer). As result I had to undo ostomy surgery, left me with permanent ostomy bags for rest of my life. I was cancer free a year after my diagnosis & treatments, but yet struggling to accept my new life with 2 ostomies. Today at 56 years old I am living a bless life;  a fashion model (yes with my ostomy bags), author, mentor, motivational speaker, & ostomy advocate. Thank you Isabella for sharing your story of hope. You are brave and strong. Someone needs to hear and see your story that all things work out for good even through a sickness. God bless.
Praying for complete healing!!! God please guide the doctors and nurses! God bless you!  ❤️🙏🏻✝️🙏🏻❤️
❤❤❤
This was such an amazing interview
Oh my gosh.  What a brave young woman ❤ Just cried my eyes out.  Many Blessings continue to come your way!!
So emotional.  Happy that she has such a great support team, both family and friends, and now, viewers.  Love you, honey.
Tears😢, tears😢, tears😢 from the beginning to the end of this video.😢 Isabella & the Strahan family, I'm praying🙏🏽 for you. I've traveled down that road of cancer.  May God☝🏽continue blessing & keeping you❤ as you heal🫶🏾
Prayers for her complete healing.🙏🙏
I pray for her
What an amazing gorgeous young women!  Stay strong. ❤🙏❤🙏
Praying for sweet Isabella
Wow! I remember when he sent them off to college. I am 🙏🏾 she  recovers and lives a long and healthy life.
Hang in there, medicine is doing good these days, I’ve gone thru three cancers and a massive heart attack. I’m now 75 , didn’t think I would  see 32, but here I am
Thankfully it's NOT very common. Stay strong and good luck on you future.💪🏽
My son had the same diagnosis when he was 7 . After having the tumor removed he was in the hospital for 86 days because it affected his speech and his walking. My son had to do chemo and radiation. As parent it broke my heart to see him go through this . After he came home he still had to go get MRI every 3 months just to make sure it doesn’t come back. A year after finishing his treatments The tumor did come back again but it was very small and he had surgery again to remove it and he had to do chemo and radiation again plus physical therapy again because it affected his walking again. My son is now 11 years old and still does physical therapy and speech but he finally reached the year without the tumor coming back . I pray every day for him to get better. I do know what you are going through and I pray she will get better soon too
Beautiful strong young woman. I pray for healing and strength to get Isabella back on campus! 💕🙏💕🙏

I lost a cousin back in the 2000's to a brain tumor. He was much older than me at the time. I was a child and he was 24 when he passed. Im now 26 and just cant imagine going through that and also passing when this young.   Cancer is awful and it runs in my family on both sides. Ive lost members to pancreatic, bone and lung cancer 😢
God Bless you Isabella and Michael and your whole family 🙏🙏🙏🙏

This is beautiful and I pray that His daughter beats cancer. Also it’s important to point out just how much more love support and resources rich and famous people get vs the other 99% of us.
"And hold you in the palm of His hand..."   Think good thoughts and hang in there thoughtful and wise Strahan family.
Wow she is so strong. I know she will be such an inspiration for years to come to many kids dealing with child hood cancer. I believe we go through hard things to find our purpose in life and I bet she finds hers when she beats this.❤
Glad you are sharing your story. I’ve recently had a medical issue and haven’t shared with everyone I know. This is inspiring to share with others our experiences ❤
🙏🙏😇

I’m crying ❤! Sending prayers
Prayers to them both. It’s hard as a parent to watch your child suffer with any illness. Sounds like they both have a great medical team and a support system. Peace and Blessings to them both. Praying for a full recovery.
I have an immune deficiency and I get the pain that illness causes for a family. Good luck on your journey, Isabella; you don't always need to be inspiring, just be inspired by life. You have so much more to live. I truly hope your tumor will be history!
As an adult who has had cancer it was rough, but I MADE IT even when I wasn't given much good news in the start.  Stay strong beautiful girl and keep that positive attitude it will get you through this battle.
My father passed away 12 years ago from brain cancer at only 47 years old! May God give you the strength to continue on this journey!
❤
Keep pushing vaccines...stupid
Get well soon Isabella, this too shall pass

Awwwe I remember his daughters from when he won the superbowl. 🙏🏾
God Bless her 🙏❤️
Bless her.   I am sorry to hear this.  I had headaches and my carotid dissected. No one knew. And nobody can or should feel guilt. Me family friends or doctors.  The journey is long.  We all are strong.  Roll with it and trust yourself.   ❤❤❤ so glad your telling your story.  I love your smiles
This young lady has a great attitude about life. May she recover quickly and enjoy life to the fullest.
Prayers for you both
God bless her. That's the same kind of tumor my Aunt died from when she was ten years old. It was 1955 and I never got to meet her. My grandparents drove her to Johns Hopkins from southwest Virginia and were told there was nothing they could do. 😪💔
May God keep you and heal you in Jesus name🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I personally experienced cancer and recently had my biannual follow up. I'm cancer free and living a very healthier lifestyle. Just like I believed God for my healing, I believe for Isabella's healing as well. Keep going young lady. You will be just fine. Long live your faith, love, and determination to overcome this time of your life.
God Bless 🙏 - such a strong young lady and can we please acknowledge how awesome of a father Michael Strahan is? So supportive and kind to his babies ❤
What an incredibly brave and strong young lady! Beautiful inside and out! Wishing her a full recovery and beautiful future! A fan of Michael’s and he has an incredible daughter there. (And family)
🙏🏽🩷🙏🏽🩷
Michael Strahan is an amazing father and sharing that he might look tough on the outside, but on the inside he had to learn about this illness with his daughter. I can see why he had to take some personal time off a while back. Isabella touched my heart in this interview in so many ways of how strong she is and what she has overcome. You got this girl!
This was so emotional and real. Wishing the best to you Isabella, you’ve got this! 💕
A nice thoughtful sensitive aspect, to have Robin included in the discussion as her own very personal experiences inspired so many. Different types of conditions, all still, the roots of inspiration extend. 🤗😢🤗
Those of us in the medical field are afraid to say the sad part. Life is not fair. What a lovely young lady. I wish the interviewer had not asked her about her future. She and her family will make the most of her time, that's her future. She should travel the world and go to all the places she ever wanted to see when chemo is over. There is no point in going to college. Stay with your family girl be lucky you have the money to travel. Go see the redwoods, go see the Grand canyon, go to your bucket list.
🙏❤️
God Bless you Isabella…Prayers to all❤️✝️🙏😇
She’s lovely❤️😇
Sending so much love
Isabella is so brave, positive and selfless in the way she's handling her diagnosis and treatment.  Her YOU TUBE channel will help so many people especially children. What a great gift she can give to others at the same time as receiving treatment.   I wish her a long happy life.  Her father and other family have been so supportive and that is a priceless gift.    I recently had surgery for a tumor and, thank goodness,  it wasn't malignant.  Having the love and support of my wonderful family during hospitalizations and recovery compelled me to comment.  Thank you Isabella and Michael for sharing this with all of us.
Praying for her. I have brain cancer too, just not the same kind. I have Oligodendraglioma went through 6 weeks of radiation and 1 year of chemotherapy. They couldn't remove all my tumor but over a year and no growth.  Sweet girl, take care of yourself and keep praying ❤
This aunty is cheering you on dear.
Sending lots of prayers for Isabella and the whole family you will beat this. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤
We love you swt❤
Did she have the vaccine?
Isabella has an army of supporters who send warmest wishes for a complete healing. My heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.
Shes gonna beat this!!! 😢
Beautiful girl, wishing Isabella all the best.
My heart is heavy  My emotions can’t be contained or controlled
May Almighty God heal her give her strength, and everyone else that’s facing cancer🙏
What a beautiful girl- inside and out
I really hope she overcomes this  So inspiring & remarkable   More beautiful than anything  So courageous & brave
God bless you you're so strong so glad you are sharing your journey it will be healing for everyone ❤xoxo ❤️ 😘
Isabella stay strong and keep moving !!!!!!!!!  You have a beautiful voice and tone of speaking !!!!!!!!!  You are an angel from God, you are a miracle !!!!!!!!  🙏  I am a cancer survivor.  I told my story to anyone who would listen.  Even if they did not have cancer, at some point they might, or know someone that did, and my story might help.  Thank you for speaking up.  You will save many lives !!!!!  I could not find the help I needed, so I did what you did, I looked it up and healed myself - Holistically!!!!!!  I went to doctor after doctor and no one would help me.  Even though I had full medical coverage.  In 2012 I lost my Dad.  In 2013 I lost my Mom.  In 2014 I lost my Job (and got cancer) (I am an American Whistleblower 🇺🇸 !!!!!!!!  (I BLEW THE WHISTLE IN 2014 for health related reasons in my classroom, I have been in litigation since then.  It is now 2024).  2015 I had to ride my bike for 9 months to get to a part time job, where I basically made $1.50 more than my job in H.S., so as not to be homeless or end up in a tent (The second week on my bike an undocumented person hit me, they were up in my town from one of the most expensive towns in NJ collecting rent on their slum properties).   I have a bachelor/Master Columbia) degree and two continuing education.  It took me 2 years and 4 months to find a doctor to tell me I had a fractured back.  I rode my bike and worked the whole time.  In 2016 they repossessed my car (I got it back a few hours later and an Undocumented person hit it for the 3rd time in a year and a half, putting it up on the curb - again.  2017 they put me in foreclosure.  2017 I slipped and fell, reinjuring my back and hip.  2018 I had my back surgery (I now have 10 screws in my back, 6 in my neck, and 4 in my lower).  2018 I had my hip surgery (they sent me to physical therapy, where they re-tore my hip in a place it cant be fixed.   2019 they put me back in foreclosure.  2020 the Undocumented lady who hit me while I was on my bike paid out and saved me from foreclosure (God is good all the time!!!!!!!!!!).  2021 they shot my car, it has 3 bullet holes.  2022 an undocumented person hit 6 cars (drunk, unlicensed, driving someone elses car (probably stolen) laned in my front porch, collapsing 4 columns and collapsing my entire 25 foot front porch.  2023 the contractor hired to fix my porch took off and did not complete the job.  There is no time to stop.  Keep moving!!!!!!  If I gave up every time I wanted to quit, I would be dead right now.  God gave you that story to help others !!!!!!!!! 🤲  Your story made me want to cry.  It is how I felt at that time too.  Your Dad is super cool !!!!!!!  Keep going you are blessed 🙌!!!!!!!!!!!! https://youtu.be/XfAIBj-pRPY?si=9P4qVLk0azqf66IF
Such a beautiful young girl , God bless her, wishing her a speedy recovery and a healthy long happy life. Just yesterday I was reading about the amount of chemicals present in our food, water, cosmetics , shampoo , hair dye and practically any and everything we use in our daily life .  Sadly the government is doing little to nothing to educate the public about these dangers. At the end of the day we are what we eat , drink , breathe etc. stay strong girl you  are loved not just by your family but millions more now that we know.
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
We are here for you babygirl. You are beautiful and we will beat this together. Cheering you on from Riverside CA. Go Isabella🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
My prayers to the whole family. This journey will take her village.  Our children are our lives and when they hurt we are crushed.
My tears for her are for continued hope and recovery. We walk by faith not by sight! I can do all things through Christ who strengths me! I hope  she remembers who her strength comes from. With a loving family and friends. Thank you for the courage that it took to tell your story! Your test will be a testimony that you will share for many years to come. Hugs 🥰
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I made another comment but I also want to say that I am happy that they are highlighting her journey because this will bring more insight and awareness to brain cancer. So often the money that is raised does not go to brain cancer but to lung cancer, breast cancer etc.  Thank you Isabella for documenting your journey. You are beautiful and an amazing young lady. I am praying for a complete and miraculous healing.
We've watched this baby from the sidelines  grow up into a beautiful young woman. Thanking God for her medical team and family for jumping into action and doing what needed to be done to fight this condition. She displayed incredible strength during the interview and we know our Robin Roberts in that additional pillar of strength she'll need to continue being a beacon of light. Will certainly look for her channel and subscribe. I was diagnosed several years with a benign, not needing operable tumor during the beginning of the pandemic. Just monitoring it because it appears to be slow growing. However, Isabella gives comfort to those who needed it the most. I'm a witness. Much prayers and love to you Isabella, Michael and the rest of the family.🙏💖💐
I have seen this several times with children and teens,. We really are not supposed to get Headaches. There is a reason we get them. If a child complains of a headache go to the doctors. My friends 12 year old son complained for a while of headaches. His grandmother said to take him to the doctors. He had tumors all over the brain. It was to late for surgery.  I never forgot it.
What a beautiful young lady. She has the soul of a warrior. Praying for you, Isabella!
Prayers going up
God Bless 🙏🙏🙏🙏 You Dear 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
My cousin who is 32 with 5 children thought she had a non-cancerous tumor removed from her breast two years ago only for now to have been told that she was misdiagnosed and it was rare bone cancer that had metastasized to her breast from her back.  She went from a prognosis of  “ there is probably no issue” to “ you have stage four non leukemia bone cancer and likely less than 24 months” in an instant. Our family is just reeling. She is also doing chemo at Duke to hopefully give her more time because they don’t think there is anything else they can do but that. If you Run into her, her Name is Shana and she is blonde with a thick southern accent and lots of kids. I can’t hardly do anything because I live in Europe now but seriously, Isabella if you see her, she is a sweetheart and she will talk to you all day while you are getting your treatments. Best of luck.
Praying for the family. 😢🙌🏾
Thank you GMA for continually being a platform for compassion. Praying for the Strahan’s.
Hang in there kiddo! You got this! I pray that you have full recovery and remission. Very brave young lady.🙏🏾❤️
Prayers to Strahan family. God Bless

Isabella, My sister was diagnosed with a medulloblastoma in 1992.  After her surgery, radiation and  13 months of chemo, she is a 31 year survivor!  With the love, support & prayers of your family and friends and excellent medical care, I pray you will also be cancer free and return to college.
God bless her.  Amazing courage.  Sending LOVE and healing energy to Isabella!
Their sharing their own very public story openly, will be/become a source of strength to others. Unfortunate they have to experience it, the hopes God brings them through it, on earth and in Heaven when God calls.
Fight Izzy 💜🫰🏼💝you got this, I’m tearing up.❤
She will overcome She is strong🎉😅
My heart hurts for this lovely young woman. 😥
What a beautiful young woman! 🩷
GOD BLES YOU, AND YOUR FAMILY.  SENDING PRAYERS, LIGHT LOVE AND HEALING . GOD GOT HER!
U sweety need rso treatment
😮😮!!
Tell Isabella we are all praying for her🙏🙏🙏
I am a parent of a child who had medulloblastoma at the age of 9. She was diagnosed just a day or two before her 9th birthday. I know how it feels to be that parent that doesn't know what to do or how to do it but you learn. One thing he said is that he learned that you are not as strong as you think you are, I have to disagree with that because I found that I was stronger than I thought I was and also because you have to be strong.   That strength comes out of no where because your child needs you, your children need you. You have to be there for the child that is going thru it but you also have to be there for the child or children that is watching their sibling go thru this and for the child or children that feels neglected. (I know this because my daughter always told me she felt neglected even though I did everything I could to be there for her too).  Watching this segment on Isabella made me think about the things that my daughter went through and it was exactly as Isabella where she had to learn how to walk again. It is very painful having to see your child go thru this.  Sadly my daughter died January 31, 2021 from a different cancer (Glioblastoma Multiforme) at the age of 21.  I am praying for Isabella and her family. Cancer affects her body, her mind and her spirit, but it also affects the family because everything  she goes through they watch her go thru it and hurt for her.   May God continue to bless their family!
Your family in my prayers, God Bless!
😢prayers for her and all her family.  🙏
Prayers and good wishes to Isabella.  Get well soon.
What a brave, strong young woman! 🙏🏻
The tears🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😢😢😢😢
So proud of Isabella sharing her VERY personal story/testimony that she chose to share with the world! Praying for her and her whole family.
Praying for you beautiful! ❤️
What a gorgeous girl she is.  God bless her.
Thank you God. BLESSINGS TO THE STRAHAN FAMILY FOR SHARING YOUR STORY
❤ she’s absolutely beautiful
No children should suffer like that.
Prayers to the Strahan family 🙏🏾
Prayers for Isabella, her twin Sofia, and the whole family!❤
This is so hard to see just to imagine how this can happen to anyone . Made me cry stay strong
Now we know why Michael was absent. So very sorry to hear what they are going through. Many prayers and hopes for a full recovery and return to her college life. Shame on all of you who made false accusations as to why Michael was absent.
Beautiful Isabella, stay strong, you will get thru this ❤
💔
God bless.
WOW! She is SOOOOO beautiful! She really IS ROCKIN' that gorgeous bald head! Sweetheart, you are SUCH a fighter and I'm only one of the millions who are SO VERY PROUD OF YOU!!! Please know that we love you, and you are NOT fighting this alone, bc we're right there with you! Prayers up, Baby!!
I am crying with you Isabella and praying for you. ❤
It’s so important to express that childhood cancer doesn’t get the funding that adult cancers do. 4cents out of every dollar goes to the kids that’s all! Kids need more that 4!
Oh Lord! Just know Isabella that God has protected you, and you will be healed. Who else can help Michael, in the kitchen, to cook? 🥲  Blessings to you, Sophia and the Strahan family! We are all praying for you always with love and healing! Bless you & your family!  I've been a contributor to St. Jude, for over 30 years.  God's got you!! Thanks, Robin and Michael, for letting us know! 🙏 ❤️🙏🏖
God bless Mike and his family. Wondering if this is the "Turbo Cancer" resulting from the Covid jab.
Thanks for sharing now I can pray for her & the entire family🙏💐
Beautiful young lady
This was tough to watch. My mom is currently battling brain cancer as well. She has an oligodendroglioma and it has been a rollercoaster the last few years. My heart breaks every time she needs a hospital stay, we get bad news on the tumor, and her symptoms get worse, especially when she is getting her chemo and she looks like she is in pain but holds it in. It is hard to see your mom go through all this and I can't begin to imagine seeing your child experience cancer. I am rooting for you and your family. Thank you for sharing your story.
God Bless for your continued recovery✝️
Michael, I am praying for your daughter's healing. With Jesus, anything is possible.
Healing prayers for Isabella❤
My husband died from brain cancer. He fought it for 4 years. An absolute nightmare and I almost didn’t make it myself. I know exactly what they’re about to go through. Find comfort in knowing you will get through this even though you will feel you can’t.
Sending prayers and she is a strong young lady!
But God🙌🏾🙌🏾🩷 as a Thyroid cancer survivor of 23 years, you are encouraging. Continue to be the light
May the good Lord we love be with Isabella and you Michael. God is good and we know him as a healer. He will heal her in the name of Jesus.
Much love to you and your daughter, Michael!!!!  She’s a beautiful soul like her father!

I feel strongly about the power of God, innovation of technology and medicine to cure/treat cancer.Praying for this family and everyone in the world battling cancer.
Lord, Please help this beautiful young lady. 🙏 Let the world see your glory through her healing journey.
This is so upsetting. You can tell he’s being strong for her, but is unsure she will make it. I pray she will make it! I totally forgot he did those St Jude commercials.
Prayers continued 🙏🏽
Maybe now people will stop giving him a hard time about missing work and not providing a statement why. Clearly this was more important ❤
❤PRAYERS❤
Amazing! So beautiful! I’ll watch.

If you're a father and watching this you understand how much just even seeing this hurts

Praying for your daughter and your family. She is stunning graceful and strong. Cancer Sucks! I am 10.5 months out of Chemo and radiation treatments myself. Sir you are not weak cancer is scary for everyone the entire family, and your extended support system. All the work you did/do with St. Jude could have very well developed these treatments that are helping your daughter and others who are or will fight cancer. You are stronger than you know I see no weakness only LOVE- 💝❤‍🩹💝
As an aneurysm/stroke survivor, I felt her strength and pain. I am left side Partially Paralyzed but fight everyday for my life and recovery. She will be such an inspiration. Blessings to all of you!
I don’t know how Michael got through this interview…….
You're gonna beat this Isabella! Be healed in Jesus' name! ❤️✝️🙏🏾

Keeping sweet Isabella in my prayers.  My youngest daughter had surgery last April for a malignant brain tumor.  The surgeon wasn’t able to remove it all, so  my daughter has to have an MRI every few months to check on the growth of the remainder of the tumor.  The first scan showed no growth, thank the good Lord.  It’s almost time for the second scan, so we’re praying it’ll bring good news.
Bless your heart dear. Praying for God to heal your cancer and make you whole again. You sure are so pretty. This time next year, you will be whole!
I pray for your total healing in Jesus name
My best wishes to you Isabella
Many blessings to the Strahan family, and may this beautiful young lady make a full recovery and live a long, healthy life.
Michael and Isabella, thank you so much for sharing your story and courage.  I feel like we all watched the twins grow up and I loved seeing twin right there in the journey helping with physical rehabilitaion.  Im in tears rn and all I can do is send many Blessings  to the Strahan Family🙏🏽
I love  you may God continue to bless you and your family
Sending well wishes to Isabella and the family.

💔💔💔💔💔🙏🙏🙏🙏😔😔😔
😢
I am so happy to hear that the drs were able to find out what she had.  This makes me so emotional because my dad is 5 months into his remission for lymphoma.  I am so glad she has spoke about it and I am praying for you Isabella you got this!!!! ❤
I watch this, this morning while getting my seven year old grandson ready for school. I took him to school, ran out of gas, it was pouring rain. As I sat in my car frustrated and upset, I remembered this story I had just watched about 20 minutes prior and I cried and became so grateful and humbled, knowing that someone always may have something going on worst than our small problems. I don’t know her, but God, please, please let her beat this.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Prayers for Isabella and family.  She's a strong young lady to share this with the public and help others👏🙏🙏
🙏🏽🫶🏾
Sending this beautiful young lady prayers and well wishes cancer doesn’t care who you are and will strike at any time when least expected it’s the criminal in the night you can’t protect from
Thank you, Isabella, for your strength in sharing the challenge of a rare cancer diagnosis, and all that has occurred and the treatment that continues.  You are a beautiful young women, twin, daughter, college student facing this diagnosis and treatment with absolute grace and dignity.  Your decision to share your journey is generous, and hopefully will add to your strength, recovery, and hope.  Robin did a beautiful job interviewing you and your dad. And your Dad will continue to love you, and be by your side.  Prayers for you, Isabella, and for everyone; family, friends, doctors, entire care team, and anyone facing a  cancer diagnosis.  Remember, tears, fear, anger, hope, smiles, laughter; whatever you are feeling or saying or doing is OK for that moment, and then remember HOPE, Faith, and Love to continue forward.  🙏🏻🤗💛🕊️.

Wow, this all happened so recently. Only 2 months ago. It's still so fresh, with so much unknown ahead of her. Her courage & positivity is admirable. May God give her the physical & mental stregnth to work her way through this challenging time & defeat it. 🙏🏼
She so adorable we will pray for her.
I've had my challenges my whole life , I was born with Hydrocephalus (hydrocephalus is commonly known as water on the brain so I have shunt which is a tube to drain the brain spinal fluid)  and Cerebral Palsy so I've had my fare share of brain surgeries over my 55 year (and leg surgeries but, right now I am talking about my experiences with brain surgery.  When my shunt starts getting clogged or broken, I get very bad headache, I compare them to lilke bad migraines.   Isabella seems like a very tough young lady.  She will get through this.
😭😭😭😭
Isabella you're so brave and exceptionally strong. I can tell youre a champ. You are in my prayers.

I am a 30 year survivor of a rare cancer. You can get through this and come out stronger with a twinkle in your eye because you kicked cancers ass!
I don't know why but I cried with her. Maybe because I have a child her age. I somehow feel the pain. She's fortunate that she has a father with money and good insurance.
Praying that Isabella will be fully healed and survive this brain tumor diagnosis. God bless you Isabella🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
WE ARE CHEERING FOR YOU ISABELLA!!!!

It’s not glioblastoma or DIPG so she has a chance, but she should be treated in a children’s hospital where they’re gonna know more about this type.  Many childrens hospitals go to age 21. Her best bet is Children’s Hospital of  Philadelphia
Devastating!!! God bless you you! Get better soon!! You have lots of love aound you!

So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. For I am the LORD, your God, who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you. {Isaiah 41:10-13}  “Keep striving, for God gives His hardest battles to His strongest soldiers.” 🙏🏾
🥹♥️ Praying for her health 🙏
Man. I hate this for her. My mama just passed away from glioblastoma on December 17. It’s a different form of brain cancer but it brings back the rush of emotions that I felt when I heard about this for my mom. I lost her in 154 days. It was so fast.  I pray this girl beats this cancer and thrives for the rest of the long life she has to live. Proud of you girl for whatever it’s worth from a complete stranger 💕
My prayers go out to you and your family, God be with you. Knowing you have your family and a great support team. It's beautiful seeing all that love, care and support that surrounds you. My advice,  Keep smiling, trust in the Lord, live and enjoy life it's not over. You're just starting life in a whole new realm. Breathe and Live God Bless
Like I said god.never u mean never give anyone more than what their bear  God his with her
God bless you all. Now we know what Michael was going through. 😢 Lord have mercy. I am in tears 😭 for him. Stay strong. I will place you on the prayer list at. Lakewood Church in Houston. Blessings ❤
Thank God for the US medical industry, they can find something like this early and treat it.  A big shout out to the people in America working to keep their citizens safe, healthy and moving forward with optimism - YOU are heroes!  💐💐
Isabella you have the greatest dad 😭 you are so brave 💪🏻
If he wasn't Michael  Strahan this story would not be put in this platform. There's many out there with this. May she keep thriving and recover and sharing. Peace
Praying for you Isabella ❤
Isaiah 33:24 And no resident* will say: “I am sick.” The people dwelling in the land will be pardoned for their error.
Wishing you all the best. May God send you healing and strength.
Beautiful young woman. I wish her all the best. I lost my Dad to Cancer and a botched surgery during Covid  in 2020 and then my Mum also to Cancer in 2022. They had end of life care at home, as they didn't want to go to hospice. It was devastating. ❤😢
She's so beautiful ❤
Support of family and The Love of God bring you through to full recovery🕊️🍃💞
Bless this sweet young lady, may she fully heal and use this time for His glory!  ❤️🙏💞
You are in our prayers. God bless you. We wish you a speedy recovery. Keep up your good spirit, my dear. ♥️🙏♥️
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Stay strong, and we will keep you lifted in prayer.
Sending love and strength ❤😢❤🤗
Heavenly Father, Heal this Child, God Bless her and her Family, in Jesus name I pray Amen...
God's blessings ❤
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💖
God Bless her!!!
Robin, of course, is the best person to do this interview because of her own cancer story.
May Allah guide and bless you Isabella! I had brain surgery as well and I am so happy you are healing sweetie!! You are beautiful
This shows the importance of how having a supportive family and having a job you love working with people you love. His daughter is so positive and felt comfortable opening up to her father’s supportive coworker, Robin. I love how the story remained focused on Isabella because Michael or Robin could’ve made it about them and they did not. Especially, Robin who has had bouts with cancer but she never mentioned that! Keep shining Isabella!
🥦🟦 sending so much ❤love and positive thoughts to the family.
She's beautiful.... Prayers go out to her, and may the Lord give her strength to beat this 🙏🏾❤️
May God bless you Isabella.  My prayers are with you.❤
Prayers!! this is so emotional and heart warming.. i had a brain tumor as well and knows all so well how hard this was for her!.. sending love and light Isabella
Sending prayers ❤❤❤
the MOTHER HAS BEEN RAISING HER NOT MIHAEL
i had a fast growing tumor at 21 and ive recovered. i always dont know if it will ever come back. but its transformed my life.   i do wish i had a youtube channel but we didnt have that back in the day. i kept it to myself a lot. im glad she has so much support and she keeps sharing. its important to do art or walks and write too! i remember going back to school w a wig and removing it cuz it was itchy and my hair grew back funny but i rocked it anyway! much love! you will get through this!!!
A little cry will help you get through this terrible time.  You’re going to be just fine, and I’ll keep you and your family  in my thoughts.
Wow the girl is not 20 yrs yet ..she’s twin
Praying 🙏🏾
just spoke to god and asked him to take care of this sweet family.   you got this Isabella❤
WOW ..thats .why ..he ..was not at work…and people were wondering what is wrong with micheal
She will know, one day, that this experience introduced her to the warrior woman inside. I have autoimmune encephalitis and nearly died of it, as it's a very rare diease and I was not treated by about a dozen doctors for over eleven months of fighting for consciousness and my brain feeling like it was on fire. I've had two flares that had tried to end me. I came to CA with my two degrees expectintg one path but another was rolled out in front of me. If I have to crawl, I'll give my all to keep moving forward. I believe that technology and science will merge more and more in the comimng years in fields like nano-medicine so I maintain my hope that, one beautiful day, neither I, this brave young lady, or any one else will have to suffer with such illnesses. What she is doing will help others with her illness. She will likely never meet most of them but it will help and that's the best thing one human being can do for another.
Prayers for Isabella's healing and the entire family strength.
Isabella, you are a strong and beautiful young lady!! Hang in there, and God Bless!!! ❤
I’m a hospice nurse. The hardest thing is when cancer touches a life so young. I cry. I pray. I’m human first and a nurse second. This story touched me on so many levels. You are strong honey girl! You’ve got family blood and otherwise take it one day one step at the time.
Her strength is beyond! My heart is with Micheal and the family.  Her light shines so bright and well not be extinguished.   #FuckCancer
Hey Isabella, you got this 💯 percent, you go girl! Thank you for sharing your personal journey. 👏🫶🙏
I wish her a speedy recovery ❤you got this ❤
Crying and praying for a speedy recovery Isabella, you got this 👍🏽❤
Why are there so many young people with cancer now???? 😮
May God continue to bless and keep you and your family, beautiful young lady, and thanks for sharing your story to help someone else. I met a lady years ago who was diagnose with cancer, and not knowing how to approach her to comfort her; she said one of the most powerful thing I ever heard in my life, and it changed my life for ever.  She said don't feel sorry for me, because I am not going through this for me, she said I'm going through this for someone else to help them get through it to one day, I stood there stunned, I didn't know how to response to it, except with a WOW! I never heard anyone say that before and to prove that she was right, She's still here today looking great and beautiful in 2024 inspiring every one who knows her story, every time I see her today, I am still in awe of what God can use us to go through to help someone else to make it through it to, so yes be encourage someone else will need your courage. I'm Praying with you and for you be blessed. ❤ 👏💯🙏.

My thoughts and prayers are with Isabella. Sending prayer for the whole family.
Praying for Isabella what a beautiful spirit she has and glad she has the support. The relationship with her father is just wonderful.
May God Bless her and their family
All the best to you ❤️ 😘
Michael, you are correct to be proud of your remarkable daughter.  Cancer sucks.  I lost my husband to metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.  I hate that she is going through this.  I understand all of the emotions.  I pray for continued health and wellness for the entire family.
Leave it to a sambo to make money off of his daughter by publicly announcing her cancer.
God Bless you my beautiful Isabella, you are on my prayer list with lots of Love and hugs. Remember God has you and his healing shield is over you. Continue to stay strong and remember there are lots of prayers with you every day. God Bless Love🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️❤️❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️❤️❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I pray that God heals her and gives her the strength she will need during this difficult time.  God bless you Sofia, ♥♥

All I did was weep / I’m praying for her and my heart is broken- she is Brave indeed and I hope she knows she gets stronger everytime she allows herself to cry… crying is to me a sign of strength.. to allow ourselves to be vulnerable by crying unapologetically! That to me is strength..let’s end the stigma on crying already- it shows our humanity and it’s ok- I’m with you Isabella ❤Prayer works wonders🙏🙏🙏🙏

Wow. That awful. Really love the cast of GMA. I used to watch GMA, before school with my father. Joan Lunden. David Hartman. They've had something going on at GMA for decades. When they get someone like Strahan, it almost too good to be true. So. This really suck what his kid, goin through. 19 year old. 19 a pivotal year for many. People say it 18 and 16. 19 is when you drop off the radar, cuz you start wanting to find yourself, and nobody know but you, that you going through this and that. Cancer everyone know you in trouble. I know a woman, who had breast cancer in her 40's, I think. She lived into her 90's. I also know someone, who a doctor, in great shape, doing very well in basically every category, just die shortly after cancer diagnosis. In some way, it not up to you. 19 year old think everything they can alter anything with they will and they abundant energy. Sometimes if you make major change in life, everything fall into place. Maybe she no wanna be in college on some level. I remember, when I in first grade, I wonder why I need to leave the house. Never made it through college, cuz of sickness too. Everything fall into place, when drop out.
Oh I’m so sorry!! I pray she pulls through this!! 🙏🏽
If you wake up with a headache, go to the doctor.
God bless you on your way to recovered health.  🙏🥺🥺😢
Stay srong micheal God will see you and your daughtet through trust him in the process.Trust God
So, so proud of her.  She is so beautiful and strong.  She will be ok, please God.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Wow God Bless her. I am sending prayers and healing prayers.
❤
NOOOO. 😢 Bless her heart and heal her Father God in Jesus Christ name❤
I pray for her complete HEALING in Jesus Name!!
I wondered why Michael was away. Sending prayers and love to Isabella and the family as she fights to live. Such a strong beautiful soul 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
The best part about it was seeing her friends by her side then seeing her twin sister by her side. That young lady is LOVED and she will fight this.
She is beautiful and brave.  Great loving father.  I am so emotional watching this video.   Pray for the family.   Thank you for sharing and it well help other families too.
All the best I’m praying for complete healing, keep smiling God got you my dear🙏
Isabella, you GOT this! Keep the faith and your family, friends, and individuals who don't know you are supporting you! I know how it feels to have cancer and take it day by day, and you will BEAT it! I'll be in remission for 2 years next month! :)
"Make your mess your message"  We love you Robin Roberts ♥ You continue to be a blessing to us all.  Isabella is lucky to have you near.  All the best to you both!

Sending healing prayers her way. What a beautiful brave girl. ❤️‍🩹
💛💛
If Michael was a typical unemployed ex criminal his daughter would be perfectly healthy if you know what I mean but either because he's a sell out or they see his bank account and that's why this is happeningThe public does not need to know and has no compassion or concern about his silly daughter and we really don't even about him can we have real news please about real people
🙏🙏🙏
Thank you for sharing! You are inspiring!❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
❤ Love and prayers 🙏🏻🙏🏻 to the entire family.
I certainly hope all involved personally, will not read comments on any content they put out. The Youtube channel sounds wonderful, but again, I suggest not reading comments!! It will waste your precious time. In my opinion.
✨🕊✨
Sending love and light to this family.
If Michael was a typical unemployed ex criminal his daughter would be perfectly healthy if you know what I mean but either because he's a sell out or they see his bank account and that's why this is happening
I've never cried through an entire interview before until now. Isabella is a wonderful young woman with a beautiful smile. I will follow her journey all the way and when she returns to college. Her strength is amazing and her family support is rock solid. You got this Isabella🙏🙏
I am so sorry for this beautiful woman and her family. So she got the surgery then they did radiation? Did I hear this correctly? They usually screw aroun with people and do treatments before surgery. At least the ppl i have taked to. I know each case is different though. Ithink that's because of who her father is. I'm glad she was able to get things figured out an I hope she recovers and helps others.
What a wonderful story about a brave young woman and family love. Blessings and healing to her.
We love you robin ❤
Praying God's Healing Power to Cover her and the family crying through it all Strength ❤ and Power from God's  Grace ❤
Praying for Healing and Strengthen her in Jesus name Amen ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
This story was so emotional I’m glad she has such a great support system to help get through these tough times! She’ll be even stronger when it’s all over
She’s gorgeous inside and out. Praying for your Speedy recovery.
I bet she had a vaccine. That doctor on Tucker Carlson said young people are getting rare cancers and odd cancers.
Wow. May God cover them and give them strength,  support, and healing.
Thank you so much for sharing your journey.
Even if one person in the family is hurting, the whole family is hurting. You could see his colleagues feeling and being with him through this process. Robin tearing up was so genuine. She knows both sides of this sad reality from her life. ❤❤❤
Michael, stay strong. Isabella stay strong, keep fighting. I'm praying for you beautiful girl.
It’s too early to be crying like this 😭😭 praying for Isabella & her whole family. ❤
Isabella, thank you for sharing your struggle with the world. How strong you are and happy your rock Sophia is by your side. God bless you all, Michael and family.🙏🏽❤️💪🏽
All of your prayer warriors are praying for you, Isabella. This is your journey, and we are here fighting with and for you. I ask our Lord and Savior to keep you covered while you take this journey into healing. I also ask for strength and comfort for your parents and your sister. In Jesus' name, I pray, Amen. 🩷🩷 Remember God got you! Let's goooo 🤗 #prayersup 🙏🏽🩷🙏🏽🩷

What a beautiful young woman !! Praying 🙏 for you to kick cancers ....... Praying in earnest
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 you're gonna be just fine Isabella  don't give up beautiful ❤❤❤❤
Beautiful girl; such a loving father, my heart goes out to you.
I don’t know much about Michael Strahan so this comment is based entirely off of this interview. When we become parents we are given the opportunity to love unconditionally (the fortunate ones) he is one beautiful father. You just don’t know how fortunate you are to have a healthy child I lost my son 15 years ago. I pray this man and his daughter will be triumphant against this terrible disease.
Michael, my daughter, Isabella, fought cancer 2 years ago. She was 25 when she passed and she was so brave! I really am praying for your Isabella. She has been so brave and I believe she will win her fight!
God Bless sweetie! Prayers of healing
Thank you for sharing your story. I know it helps so many. God bless you Isabella, family and friends.
Prayers to the Strahan family. This brought tears to my eyes. Wishing her a Godly recovery
Praying for your daughter we serve a mighty God and good God 👍 🙏 🙌 ✨️ ❤️ ♥️
May God continue to bless her and the family and Michael Strahan family because it is a blessing that she has let her story out to help other people🙏🏽 I pray for her healing in Jesus name
I have been a fan of Michaels forever now his daughter too such beautiful people. God bless them🙏
I am crying joy of tears.
How sad, she's a beautiful girl. Such a scary time for her. She's extremely brave, wishing her a speedy recovery.
You are brave way beyond your years Isabella! Know you have a great support team!
She is an amazing young lady. Beautiful inside and out. She will inspire others with her message. Prayers for a complete recovery. Stay strong!
God bless her 🙏
Wow, thank you for sharing. I too was a parent with a daughter diagnosed with a very rare brain, tumor and cancer, so I understand what you’re going through Michael and the family. Good vibes coming your way.❤
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 Prayers to this brave strong young lady❤
I’m in tears. Prayers for this family. ❤

You got this, baby girl! You're going to have to fight and be strong! Surrounding you with love and prayers for strength and healing, Isabella! God bless you and your sister and your family!
Wow amazing powerful young women 😢 God bless here heart❤❤to keep her strong ..
We love watching Michael on GMA and Fox NFL. This just shows that you never know what’s going on with people. I’m so glad he shared his vulnerability while supporting his daughter. Being the “spectator” to a loved ones struggle is tough because it’s not your battle. Thank you Isabella for your bravery in sharing your story. You will help others. May you be blessed with a full recovery.
she’s so beautiful.. inside and out. I lost my grandmother last year to stage 4 cancer within six months. she was so healthy. so we were never really prepared… i still question why her 💔  this interview moved me tears. especially when she cried. she’s so strong! you got this girl. you are allowed to feel what you feel. God, your family, friends, now the whole world’s got you. don’t lose faith 🙏🏽 sending love, prayers, and strength your way!
She is too young for this.  My Mother died from a brain tumor, but she was near 70.  Sucks.
I prayed for he 🙏r she is so sweet 🙏
Isabella my thoughts and prayers will be with you and your family.
Sending Prayers your way ! May God Bless you n your family 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Stay strong beautiful ❤ it’s a battle but keep fighting even when you’re tired! Praying for your healing.
This is so sad
You can see the pain in his eyes
I am weeping at work. I had lymphoma when I was 15, and watching this beautiful girl feel her experience made me feel mine again. It’s not ok that so many kids and people, are affected by this horrible thing called cancer. She doesn’t deserve it. And watching her dad made me cry for my parents all over again because they had to be stronger than I did at times. My heart is with you Isabella. ❤
Wonder why there's been a huge increase in every type of cancer since 2020.
I don’t care how big and strong that you think you are, when your child is sick… it will bring you to your knees!!! I wish them well, she sounds so weak, I pray that she gets better, and stronger. She and her sister are absolutely beautiful. I wish them the best. 🙏🏽✝.
Wow.  So sorry but so moved how Isabella is getting through her diagnosis and treatment.  Cancer is a bitch.  Breast Cancer Survivor so I really understand.  Prayers and hugs to you.
You’ve got this Isabella! The torment as a parent to watch your child in pain is surreal. Praying for your healing.
That is one strong women that shines strength across the seas . Stay strong ❤
You never know what people are going through...they talked about Michael  for missing work days but this is why. I pray shes able to pull through.
From a father who has had to bury a child spend all the time you can If you have the money stop what you're doing and spend as much time as you can take as many photos and videos as you can take her or him wherever they would like to go if you can. the hardest thing you can ever do as a parent is bury a child it sucks so flipping bad for anyone going through this or has gone through this I think they know what I'm saying 😢❤
Her strength is beyond amazing ❤ Prayers to her ❤  And courage to her entire family
Such a beautiful young lady. And I’m praying she beats this and she will. She will live a glorious young life with countless of blessings . Time for a cure America . And to stop caring about how chemotherapy treatments fill your pockets up. Innocent lives daily are leaving us old and young . Time for a change. 19 yo shouldn’t be hit with this it isn’t fair but that’s life for you smh
When it is someone you love that you are watching go through a life-threatening disease, you find you’re carrying a lead weight around in your gut all the time. Secondhand suffering is a very real thing.
🙏🏽 🙏🏽 🩷🩷 🙏🏽 🙏🏽

What a beautiful brave girl.
Just saw this on GMA. What a brave woman! I very much liked your story.
My mom is battling stage 4 breast cancer. She had it about a year ago, but Stage 3. Went thru the chemo and medication and managed to defeat it. But now it's back. It's a fight. The chemo takes alot out of you and the cancer wears you down. At times she's down but she's not out. Just keep fighting, keep going thru the treatments. Rest, stay hydrated and don't give up. There is light at the end of the tunnel no matter how bleak it seems at time. Stay safe and take care.
❤❤❤
Thank you Isabella for sharing your story!  🙏🏾✝️🙏🏾
💔
Brain cancer? That’s what they call it now? So many different names for this, why?

My mom had a brain tumor. She passed away several years ago. It was non cancerous, but it was located in a difficult part of her brain, and the doctors could only get parts of it. She lived much longer than expected with it, ultimately succumbed to it after battling for 7 years.
My son is a pediatric cancer survivor. Prayers to this brave young women.
I hope and wish the best to your family and stay strong
May the Lord Jesus heals you and show you his face. And help her families Jesus. Amen.❤
My prayers go to you and your family ❤🙏
having a support system as strong as Isabella's is what gets you through these hard curveballs. Only the best wishes to you and your beautiful loved ones babe
OMG, this was a hard one to watch 😢🩵. Wishing you a happy speedy recovery, Isabella.
Much love and prayers for you Isabella and your whole family.  I am so truly sorry you are going through but thank you for sharing your life with us. Please stay strong and know what an inspiration and help you are being to so many

I am so very sorry you are going through this.  Sending love, hugs and prayers ❤🙏
🙏🏾🙏🏾
GMA jockstrap's incestuous relationship with fake news, propagandists too lazy to go outside offamily or camera man's children to manufacture themselves as the "story"
What a strong, pretty, and well spoken young lady. Wish her all the best!
🖤🖤🖤🖤
I’m praying for Isabella’s complete recovery. She is a strong and beautiful young lady 🙏🏾🙏🏾
Omg. This was so emotional. I’m just crying. I’m so proud of Isabella💗
Not because it is Mike but I wish anyone in this world in pain or ill the very best. It is devastating to hear even in the 21st century so many people ill of cancer and so much money wasted in wars or things like that. There is no doubt in my mind that this beautiful girl will succeed to get better. It is really inspirational to hear such a young girl be so brave and positive.  In the other hand and respectfully, I think is that it is sad that how many are lacking of basic health care and someone need to be rich or be a celebrity to reach access to probably top level health care and access to best doctors in the world. How long someone would in the real world would wait for a lab test or see a specialist? Likely people are dying because of poor health care.   Thanks for sharing
So sorry to hear about this young lady,  we as humans  beings are so quick to pass judgment,  the father was not on television,  and so was  the negative comments,  not know the situation his daughter is going through.May God give the family peace in the midst of the storm 🙏🙏🙏🙏
I am praying for sweet Isabella!  You got this!  God got you!
I couldn’t stop the tears. I thank God for the love Isabella has around her. Michael Strahan and Robin Roberts are true blessings. Isabella is amazing and beautiful and she has the spirit of determination. That fight she has will get her through this and that victory is going to be something amazing!  My heart goes out to Michael Strahan and Isabella’s mother. I remember when Michael abruptly came off air. Michael you are a great father, so loving and attentive. Overall…you’re a great man.  And Robin I know this was hard for you too because of the love and care you have for others. God bless you. You are one of one.
She's such a beautiful spirit! Many blessings are surrounding you, precious child of god!!😇🙏❤️💯
She is beautiful.  I pray she makes a full recovery.
Prayers to Isabella 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻!! You got this ♥️♥️♥️
I was late for work trying to watch this story this morning. Glad she is ok ❤

Glad she chose to share her story because it will help many people, especially the younger generation. She is Rocking that do...SO GORGEOUS!❤
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I hate Cancer and there should have been cures created by now. What is Cancer research  doing with the billions of dollars in donations they continuously receive . They continue using the same exact methods that do not cure the cancers. Chemo, Radiation and toxic meds plus  run commercials of sick children suffering from Cancer it is horrible. I wish I could heal each and every one. Let's all manifest to have  Cancer Disappear and for complete healing of the ones who are fighting it within their bodies.
I’m crying. Ugh. Nothing else in this world matters only our children. Praying for this beautiful angel. You got this Isabella, God has his hands on you and your family❤
Sweet, beautiful young lady...get back to your comfort soon.  God bless, keep strong baby.
Praying for full recovery 🙏
Isabella,God got this, he will never leave you. You are strong. We love you.. God loves you more,he is the healer.....❤🎉🎉
Really!!

Sometimes, I can't stand GMA in the morning, I tear up on most of their heartwarming stories. But this one hits home because seeing Micheal on today everyday you feel like he's family.  I balled my eyes out the whole story. I am so glad, they are able to treat her cancer and that she has all the love from her sister and family. Thank you for sharing!

Michael is an adorable loving Father. Stay strong Isabella, wishing you a quick recovery.

I can’t believe I’m crying so early this morning.  I was not expecting to hear the devastating news about Michael Strahan’s daughter Isabella.  She is such a strong young woman to tell her story.  She has a long road ahead of her.  She has her medical team, family, friends, and a large community surrounding her.  Isabella started a YouTube Channel to document her journey. Her journey will help others. Sending prayers to you and your entire family.
