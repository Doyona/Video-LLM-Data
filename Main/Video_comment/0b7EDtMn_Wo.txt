IS THAT WHO I THINK IT IS AT THE END?!
The flu is not contagious. It is a detoxification process from being poisoned. There are dozens of things that are known to cause influenza like illness, like organophosphate (OP) exposure for example.   Think you're not getting exposed to organophosphates? Think again. It's in the food you eat, the water you drink, the air you breathe, the chemicals you use on a daily basis, it's everywhere.   Your body has a very difficult time detoxifying from it so it builds up in your system until the body is overwhelmed and undertakes a detoxification process known as the flu.
Surely you are gay.
Why do you still make videos, your content is 90% click bait and 10% pedophilia/insest
fucking hilarious love it
So glad to see you so happy you deserve it sm

Congrats Carmie - well done in getting your first place! I assume it’s leasehold and if so, be prepared for paying a few thousand pounds per year for maintenance charges!
