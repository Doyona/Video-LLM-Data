I love this version of James so much.
Finally on the ps catalogue but I’m not really into horror. Should I still give it a go?
Lo acabo de terminar y menuda obra maestra, que lastima que no gano ningún premio.
العبه انا من لاعبين رزدنت إيفل مع اني جربتها غير ما اعجبتني مره الوحوش نفس الشي ضباب متاهه ماش العبه اقيمها 3\10
Cant wait for the Silent Hill 1 remake trailer!!!!
Finished it yesterday evening. Total triumph. Well done, Bloober
THEY DID IT! THEY FINALLY DID IT, THEY DID JUSTICE!
Love this game, played it a few times and it never gets old or boring
Best game 😢
3:05 that was a lie.
I js know the OG fans started seizing when this game was announced😭
2:30 sound ? pls
Este remake fue muy acertado , se ve la depresion ,la desesperacion , la melancolia y ese vacio existencial , pero el nuevo silent hill F no logro trasmitir la verdadera esencia de un Silent Hill .
This differed drastically from the finished product. Bloober Team took the criticism and listened. It's a phenomenal game, one that I love dearly. 😊
Here before silent hill f
Outside
What a game❤️
silent hill 2 n'est pas vraiment un jeu, c'est plus une réflexion, ou un voyage symbolique au fond de la solitude, du sentiment d'abandon, du rejet social et de la sociopathie (à travers le personnage d'Eddie), du drame familiale et de la violence domestique, et pour James, du passé qui finit toujours par le rattraper dans les méandres de la dépression.   D'ailleurs la ville en elle même, Silent Hill, est un symbole : tout le temps enveloppé de brouillard, sinueuse tel un labyrinthe, humide, sombre, et infestée d'ombres menaçantes. c'est un ''jeu'' franchement original, et très artistique, qui propose de nous emmener au bout de la tristesse, et de nous faire découvrir le coté obscur de la vie.
Hey we really have to thank Konami for this one. Now there is a way for new fans to get into the silent hill series
My only problem is the graphic style.. way too polished and clean looking for silent hill... it needs to be less clear less soft... the reason the og was unique is because of the distorted dirty design ... adds to the terror and fear of the unknown.
Woke game massive L
What is blessing my ears at 2:30?!
Perfect game. Finished yesterday. Got the "Leave" ending.
🔥🔥
11 million views... and the game turned out to be a huge hit! 😄
GOATED
Una caca
1:52 Huh, thats the same stock sound used in the ending of FF7: Crisis Core when Cloud reaches out to Zack.
song? 2:30
Grace
Cant wait for the Silent hill 1 remake. Bloober team absolutely cooked with silent hill 2.
I get it...SH2 is a legendary game, but  silent hill 1 explains how the town ended up what it is...Don't ya think that would be something a new generation would like to know?
When did you guys complete the game?  (This may not get a lot of likes, comments, and attention)
I’m happy they didn’t include it in the game but I kinda like the cutscene of James barging into the bathroom. You can tell it’s before the dementia kicks in and he’s panicked and frantic over killing Mary. Bc the moment dementia hits is when he looks at himself in the mirror. That’s why he’s breathing heavy and shaking before he does it, and it all drops the minute he looks at himself. He goes from panicked to confused and disassociated. Love those details.
One of the best games I've played.
James looks more like Harry in this version, glad they made him younger looking in the final
I remember when my friend doubted this game saying it looked bad or woke and here we are now and it is one of if not the best remake released in history
I'm sorry i doubted Bloober on this initially. It wont happen again. Silent Hill 2 remake was perfect and the Silent Hill 1 remake will be phenomenal! 😭
Silent hill 1 remake is coming guuuuuuys, silent hill is back can you imagine🥹🥹🥹🎉🎉🎉🎉
Hey what’s the name of track that starts at 2:30 anyone please!
Sh1 is coming!
Since Bloober team are now making a remake of Silent Hill 1, I thought id come back to where it all started.
Here again because of the announcement of Bloober SH1 remake!
Coming back here after the silent hill 1 remake announcement 🙏
Who is here after SH 1 remake announcement?
We're getting Silent Hill 1 remake by the same studio that give us this awesome remake 💜
Hands down best horror game I have EVER played, not a game a masterpiece! Just sad I’ve completely it. Can’t wait for Silent Hill F!!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you Bloober Team! This game remake was a masterpiece!!! I loved every second of it
A masterpiece
Actually a really great game!!
Release: Tuesday, 08.10.2024
The quality is insane I can’t find words the effort really shows it’s unlike anything I’ve experienced in a video game maybe rdr2 comes close but playing this was so immersive and I find myself wanting more
In my rizzless dreams...
DreamsRemain.
Bro i didn't know this game is a zombie Survival i don't someone tells me pls.
The best game of ps5 I'm loving it
nicee
when this trailer came out, i couldnt hold it any longer for it to be released. Now were here, after coming out as the best game of 2024. It feels nostalgic already
I love Silent Hill 2
still the greatest psychological horror game out there
Das ist echte Silent Hill und nicht Silent Hill f. Weiß nicht was konami sich dabei gedacht hat. Leider schade wer weiß wie das neue Silent Hill gameplay Aussehen wird. Abwarten
Who's here after playing the whole game and just doesn't get enough of it.
Is anyone else here after the Silent Hill F trailer ?
The piano at the end, where can I find more of that?
The track played is Anam Cara or “soul friend” Pretty cool fact :)
Shorts dominance fr!
what the name of this music  0:35
One of my favourite games of all time
................................................  0:50
Silent Hill 1 Remake🗣️ Silent Hill 2 Remake☠️  Silent Hill 3 Remake🗣️ Silent Hill 4 Remake🗣️  Silent Hill HD Colection "Silent Hill 😶‍🌫️ 1,2,3,4"
og silent hill 2 remake designs were so much better and realistic/cinematic, with james showing lots of emotions and expressing the torture/torment he is living through by being in silent hill and looking a lot more similar to his father in time the changes will show and will be seen for the huge downgrade it ended up being
اشتقت لها 😢
i heard that background sound before at 1:53 maybe from MGSV
Best MrRaceHawk game
On the last mission atm. What a game
I got this on my ps2
3:06:54 TEMON de Silent Hill  (Cine)
I loved this game
I love this maria/mary way better than the original, i hope they add the "born from a wish" scenario in this
Sad the latest resident evil games aren't like this, capcom needs to do better to top this off
Resident evil has nothing on this game, pure masterpiece
Cool
Hellen
Does anyone know the music/theme at 2:30 ?
It doesn't come close to what Silent Hills could have been....
I knew this game would be fire
One of the world's greatest gaming experience
Remake silent hill 1 and 3 like this please 🙏🏻
The Beast Game 💪😈😍
The only problem about the game in retrospect is the dog wasn’t a ps2 render lol 😂
Ps4 ???
Ps4 ?? ?
My initial impression of this game was wrong and I really hope they remake the other 3 classics!
What's the track playing at 02:29?
«ASHEN GAMES»  Games will soon move to phones on Earth, Paradise, soon the country of Tamri  ستنتقل الألعاب قريباً إلى هواتف الأرض، الجنة، قريباً بلاد التمري Google Play APK

GOTY 2024 🎉❤
El VERDADERO GOTY 2024
hoje, 19/12/24 finalmente zerei essa obra prima, com o final:  "Na Água", logo estarei zerando novamente e indo atras dos outros finais, que jogo meus amigos...que jogo!!!
I think this game should come on PS4 also
This deserved the goty
Me van hacer ahorrar para comprar la ps5!! Todo por no quererlo sacar para la ps4😤😾😾😾
Now it's 2 months out and oh my, what a delight it's been playing this game..🙏 A true modern masterpiece
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻❤
Alguien sabe el nombre de la canción del min 2:31????
2:30 name of the song??
Yo,i came from the future to tell yall in October 2022 that they nailed it.
I can't believe it turned out as well as it did, honestly one of the best remakes I have ever played.
Humans do not suffer for what they hate and reject.  True suffering comes from what you love.
I want to play this game yo
I need the song at the very end 😭
Finished the game a week ago..
Nomine Goty failed kkk
Does anyone know what’s the name of 2:14 soundtrack?
Look Kojima they made something!
0:35  am I the only one that thought paint it black was playing for a sec?😅
What’s playing in the last 10 seconds ??? When James sees Maria I can’t find it in the soundtrack  Please help
En mis sueños más inquietos veo este remake Silent hill  Pensaba que iba a ser muy mal juego Pero...  Estaba equivocado  Y termino siendo el mejor remake jamás creado en la historia  Muy buen trabajo bloober team y konami por revivir semejante obra maestra 😎👌
This is masterpiece.
deu tudo certo
Had no belief in Bloober Team but with enough help from Konami they made a masterpiece,  A work of art!
Now...  SILENT HILL 3 REMAKE!
2024😅😅😅😅
What an awesome remake. Bloober did a great job
Amazing Franchise 🔥🔥👏
😮‍💨
This is amazing!
I avoided liking the trailers since the beginning because I was doubtful but I had to comeback, this Remake really is an experience..🥲
waiting for me?
*NOW WE NEED A SILENT HILL 1 REMAKE*
Coming from the future.. Bloober Team did it.. Silent Hill is back!
Still waiting on the identity of this piece 2:29 ...
GREATEST HORROR GAME EVER CREATED 10/10
Who of you knew about Snatcher? A game by Konami, that is super expensive today.
the sound in this game is pretty nice
Помню когда вышел этот трейлер все были востревожены тем что за ремейк отвечают Bloober Team. Чтож, теперь я думаю большинство хотят чтобы им поручили в будущем переделать первую или третью часть, конечно, если Konami этого захотят
Is it still on ps4?
Sorry blooder team 😢
anyone know what track it is that starts at  1:28 ? Is it an intended extension of the anam cara track from the OST that plays earlier in the teaser or is it a separate track?
Finished the game, I'm sorry I removed my dislike now. 8.5/10 you guys killin it.
Why was his face so different only in the opening? In the rest of this trailer he doesn’t look that different from the final release
I was wrong Bloober. Thank you, really. ❤
He's BAAAAACK
Perdón  por  haber dudado bloober team
No puedo creer todavía que después de todos estos años ya esta entre nosotros esta obra maestra del horror, que ya supero el millón de ventas y que el juego es simplemente una obra de arte, gracias Bloober Team por revivir esta saga que marco mi infancia para siempre!!!!
They changed the opening where he touched his face between this trailer and the release, I knew I wasn't crazy
Beat the game. GAME OF THE YEAR!!! THEY PULLED IT OFF!!! THEY DELIVERED EVERYTHING!!!!
THEY DELIVERED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
does the ost at 2:29 part has an actual name? it's so majestic
That last music track where james is approaching Maria 😭 so beautiful!!!
Incredible game, thanks for this masterpiece ❤️
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO DOUBTED ARE NOW CRYING WA WA
Whoever made this trailer needs to be fired, it doesnt represent the tone of the game at all.
It was worth the wait
plss remake Silent Hill Origin and make it Travis more badass and can combo punch.
Glad they changed the face
Te perdono por todo Bloober Team
Materpiece. Thank you Bloober Team and Konami.
Well I was wrong, tons of people were wrong , im glad. Now its time to remake 1, 3 and 4!
Why it feels to me that this trailer looks better than the final one? yes, some animations looked odd but it had a darker tone when compared to the final release.
Can't believe im playing this Masterpiece right now ❤❤❤ Thank you Konami & Blooberteam
Masterpiece. KONAMI ❤
سلام برای آقای علی جمالی کپی نمی کنم دوستان
Its aight.
The movie Silent Hill, released in 2006 is allowed for all public in Italy. I think that's a correct desicion.  If the child can handle it, let him or her watch!
Perhaps i treat it you harshly.....
When the game lives up to the hype 🙏🏾
0:35 what soundtrack is this from ?
I jever thought it looked bad but after finishing remake. THEY NAILED IT!!
They actually did it!
In my restless dreams, I see that perfection...  ...Bloober Team
Please, remake Silent Hill 1 🙏
IT WAS PEAKKK
I just got my copy today, can´t wait to go home and play this, I can´t believe is been 2 years since this teaser🖤
2:30 whats music? PLZ
Just played for 4 hour straight, absolute banger
Oh wow it did live up to its expectations!!!
Extremely hot take but James looked much better here than in the final product. I think he looks too much like Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil 4 Remake now. His face is also more detailed in this trailer than his face in the final product, which, while more faithful to the original, seems too smooth and looks like plastic. Ah well, he still looks fine but I was hoping the Remake would give us a different depiction of James because it's a Remake, not a remaster.
Sim, Deus viu você vindo aqui tirar seu deslike. Bobinho. :D
2 Years ago? It can't be real...
No os lo compréis ni vale nada  solo es caminar y buscar y ya
It is out now after 1 year of waiting finally 🎉
The no of sales will tell konami not to remake games with western companies
I have the game. It's at my house right now. I've been playing it. I'm still coming to watch this again because I can't wait to get back to it.
All the fans who can admit they were wrong about this game 👇
The game looks even better than this !! Love the remake
Las graficas del trailer no tienen nada q ver con el juego
То чувство когда с самого начала верил что ремейк получится годным и не слушал нытиков)
¡Gracias! Por favor, ahora hagan el remake de Silent Hill 1 y Silent Hill 3. 😊.
Now that we're a couple of days close to the release date and that this remake has shut mouths and has exceeded our expectations, i can finally say that the wait was worth it. Thanks a lot bloober team :)
Someone play that Megamind clip of shouting he did it cause Bloober actually managed to nail the remake
Ps4 ¿
2:29 Anyone know what song this melody is from on the SH2R soundtrack? It’s beautiful.
1:40 which soundtrack is it
Kinda looks like crispin glover
Show
I woke up this morning not knowing about this I never have preordered something so fast SILENT HILL 4 life dawg
Konami … i’m ready
What a great period. Rush week comming in few days and sh2 remake octobre 10th
2024/9/23 س4:47 م
I just wanna comment and say a few things this game comes out in 2 weeks and the achievements for the game were leaked and this remake has a total of 43 achievements and 1 of them is the UFO ending needs to be achieved for this to happen in a remake of only one in the series thus far can’t be possible due to the fact that in the original James from SH2 meets Harry from SH1 and see a UFO then James gets shot by a alien i know these “Endings” ain’t cannon but to make a character model for Harry for a remake that don’t exist just seems all to “Hidden in Plain Sight” cliche ….. in this I believe Silent Hill 1 will be the next remake considering the series success and it’s the oldest game in the series it deserves it
Vim pelo Inteligentista, quem mais😅😂
Comes out in like 3 weeks, it's real, I'm not dreaming
Wow… this trailer was so underwhelming but the second trailer got me so hyped
but why leons haircut?
waiting this so much
I don’t need you anymore?     Something in my head went to that little girl he’s referring to maybe it was all a lie
I never had a chance to play this game so I’m new to it
I've never played any Silent Hill, but these comments got me interested. Is this like a game version of a scary movie or something? Can someone explain or give me the run down?
El día que tenga Playstation 5, este va a ser uno de los primeros juegos que voy a jugar 😊
Thank f*ck they changed the mirror shot
1:04 "In my restless dreams I see that town"
Came here to compare. Newer trailer increased quality a lot^^
Bro I know this game is going to be amazing but this trailer was trash. Absolute trash
Фу-ты ну-ты, серьезно?))
Modern Audiences 😂😂
They should remake 1 with this engine for ps5 and xbox one
The game character looks like leon s. Kennedy father if you feel the same like the comments 🙏😅
Way to lose your fanbase. Sellouts.
Why does it seem like a woke failure...... You already have the work done, just put current graphics and more details in the gameplay and that's it, you don't have to make changes to the characters and Lore 🙏🏽.
❤
Awweeee not enough people playing your DEI horror game??
That not silent hill 2.
sweet baby inc :/
0:34 ugh the music 👌
silent hill 1 psx remake
leon'un çakması amkkk
María!!
We should all review the game 1 star, so they are forced to release the original game on PS5 consoles.
James Sunderland walks like Azuma, portraited by Takeshi Kitano, in Violent Cop.
🎉
Love that Masahiro Ito and Akira Yamaoka came back for this!
James looks like David Lynch
Why's the teaser much better than what we got.
Que silent hill ni que ocho cuartos, ”Emio”le va a ganar
Finally those who haven't played it.
Hyped
Maria kinda sounds like Nicole Tompkins (Jill Valentine from Re3 remake)
В Россию опять не повезут или контракт успели подписать?
Get woke, go broke! For modern audience🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
*I hope to see new things in this remake.*
GOTY
1:26 THEY PUT HIM ON THE TRAILER OFMGMRMGMGMGMDN
😢😢😢
0:43 he didn't get the facelift surgery he paid for.
Im gonna miss P.T.
shut up n take my money
Ia ser tão bom se rodasse no PS4 🥲
Vivement que se jeux sort 🙏❤️
It's going to be released this year in October
Could have had what PT was offering. Could have had the franchise still going if Konami didn’t abandon it and sell the franchise to pachinko machines. This game deserves to bomb.
Can't wait to stick my arm in the toilet again looking for the safe code.
Is that piece of music at the very end when he sees Mary from the original soundtrack?
DEI ESG consultancy = no buy from me and I was ready to shell out on a ps5 for this. Choose your allegences carefully devs you will be the one paying the price not the consultancy companies.
This is fake
The music behind! 🖤🖤
..... what happened to the original soundtrack :(
Am I the only one who think SH 3 is the scariest of SH 1-3?  I cannot really explain why.   SH 2 is much drama, and SH 1 is so much monsters, that eventually it's simply not that scary anymore, "only" very disturbing.
Remember folks ''for modern audiences ".   They wont be getting my money
I can't stop thinking what Lisa's death scene from SH 1 would be watching, with this graphic 😢  So sad scene.
I got a hit detection.....
Why does this looks better than the newest trailer?
Silent Hill is really bad without Hideo Kojima. People remember the Silent Hill PT more than this garbaggggeeeeeeeeeee
I really wish i could buy this. I want a Great Silent Hill 2 remake. But its gonna be horrible.  Rip AAA games. Yall earned it.
what's the ost playing at 2:29 pls ?
This is an LGBT remake. It was worked on by quota people, as well as companies like SWEET BABY INC (an LGBT company promoting inclusivity and representation in games). Don't buy the remake. He is mediocre and wretched. Do not support the mockery and parasitism of the LGBT industry over legendary games.
Turned out to be woke garbage by stupid tone deaf developers
FLOP remake MEME... Agora vão acabar com os jogos fazendo remake com personagens diferentes do jogo? É FLOP remake bom é RESIDENT EVIL que fazer igual ao jogo e não altera o personagem, remove esses meme do remake FLOP FLOP FLOP FLOP
Wow, this looks really bad.
the lighting really bad...no atmosphere...why back of the body always so bright?????????The light through from our monitor????????
I remember playing the original on my PS2 years ago back in middle school. I think they only charged, like, two buck at GameStop for it back then lolz
They uglified the wife on purpose... not buying this game.
Silent Hill is the Best Horror Game and Hello From România in Bucharest District 6 💙💛❤️🇹🇩🇹🇩🇹🇩🇹🇩🇹🇩🇹🇩
Que buena pinta tiene 😍 ya era hora de traer juegos japoneses a PlayStation 😍❤️
the worst Playstation game in years and everything they release is a total failure and I have a question how to open it on Xbox or another company that seriously does its job
Feeling meh
there was no need for a remake/remaster, the original is perfect.  for young gamers who want to experience it, i recommend getting a ps2 and playing it, but i know it's hard to come by.  it's for these young players that konami should do a re-release of the game, formatted only for compatibility with ps5, nothing more.  the game's "bad" graphics, dirty, gritty appearance makes it all the scarier, having such clean graphics will make it less scary.
Я буквально выросла на этих играх, очень жду!!!
да выпустите же эту игру наконец, я у стал ждать
Hola a todos alguien sabe cuando sale este pedazo de juego?   venga un saludo
WHERE IS MARIA👹👹👹👹👹👹👹
the 1 game that doesnt need more detailed graphics gets a remake, also the 'tone' of the trailer is off.
I must have watched this trailer more than 150 times
Something seems off
Whos here after hearing about Return to Silent Hil?l
долго ждём
I need silent hill 2 remake need xbox series x
all they have to do is update the graphics and this will be a 10/10 masterpiece
Can't wait for the pc release
Team Bloober, please do not touch this legendary game, do not spoil the experience for new players! Looking at the gameplay of the game and James' face makes me want to cry. This game sank very deeply into my soul, especially the ending with 4 minutes of Marie's monologue
Hope they remember to put the game back into this video game.
小嶋さんとこと比べると笑ってしまったw 日本のレベルの低さが露呈してしまった
I am waiting this game
PlayStation PDP to j u l i e t
SH1, SH2, SH3, SH4, SH Origins ❤️‍🔥❤️, silent hill 2 remake🤷‍♂️
We want remastered the others : silent hill 3 , silent hill 4 the Room , Silent hill Origins , and Silent Hill Shattered memoery ❤❤❤❤
Really made a game out of Lamarr's song.
ALMOST 2 YEARS NOW, C'MON
Cadê os brasileiros
No offense but guy chi should have again been used along with his voice as James Sunderland
I really hope they do like Capcom and remake most of the older Silent Hill game
Why this trailer looks better than other trailer
We need a lot of Fog, no fog no silent
I swear dude after watching this tailer multiple times the music sounds a little off. Pls include a soundtrack swap.
I'm not your Mary...
I don't support a black company which slaves creators and abandons even one of the best director in the world.
Voice acting is cheesy
bloober team *-*
people don't understand this is prerendered, they're making fun of the trailer not the game
this will be magnificent
Honestly I like the original model faces for James and Mary. Mary was alike Cameron Diaz. James now looks like an old man not in his thirties like the original. I guess somebody will recreate the faces with some graphic mod.
Looks like a previous generation game
Does this have sweet baby inc influence on it? lol cause if it does ima not going there.
😮
What i was waiting for
It's incredible but all Japanese games seem to resident EVIL cold and scary.... 🇯🇵💀
Another depressing remake? I though Konami stopped doing games.
Just give us the OGs on Nintendo switch
Resident Evil number 2😒
in my restless dreams . . . i see that game . . silent hill2
Réquiem
Mmm idk about this one. Aside from the graphics, it seems like they're going in a different direction with the charcaters. The new VAs sound too old and James also looks too old.  As will all rebooted games this will fall short of the original
Гена Букин вернулся в родной Екатеринбург
Love it, can't wait to play c:
Crazy this dropped a year ago and  still know nothing about the game
Great now a 3rd silent hill movie will not hurt
5555
When ?
Ps5 or ps4 lol graphics are not great
Has an alan wake 2 and evil within 2 vibe. Love it.
i will buy ps5 only to play this game
This remake trailer is a perfect example why I don't think for example Jaws becomes better in blu-ray, compared to DVD or even VHS.
SH 2 was deep psychological drama. This looks like ordinary horror movie. I guess remaster is made by Americans instead of Japanese?
It's weird, this trailer actually got me kind of excited to see what they might make from this even though they showed no gameplay.....then I saw the "Combat" trailer....and now I'm regretting it, that gameplay already looks like its gonna destroy all the premise that made SH2 such a godly atmosphere/suspense/horror game. Why make it an RE2:Remake clone (and a bad one at that) when SH2 was so standout BECAUSE it was a different take from RE?
Unu que sad yo tengo la cuatro ,no voy a poder jugar esta hermosura 😢
Hes literally me
Лучше бы сделали ремейк на первую часть 🤦
"Silent Hill 2" is a survival horror video game developed by Konami and released in 2001. It's renowned for its psychological horror elements, intricate storytelling, and eerie atmosphere. The game follows James Sunderland as he searches for his deceased wife in the mysterious town of Silent Hill, encountering disturbing creatures and confronting his own inner demons along the way. It's considered a classic in the horror genre and has had a significant impact on gaming culture.
maiculeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Hope they bring back metal gear too💔
is that murphy? same voice actor?
ولا ازال انتظر
I've never played any Silent Hill game, but this looks LEGIT🤘🏽👌🏽
WHEN , WHEN , WHEEEEEEN ????????
This trailer has 10 times more views than Silent Hill 2 had sales, because the bulk of Silent Hill 2 fans have never actually played it.
this looks SO AWESOM. Huge appreciation for Masahiro and Akira, they are INSANE.!
mejor saquen silent hills
There's something about  Haunting of Hill House that reminds me of Silent Hill 2..
Can't wait to see Pyramid monster in 4K UHD Photorealistic
i refuse to play this because it looks terrifying. the original is scary enough😅
why isn't this coming out on ps4? Battlefield 4 on ps3 looked terrible, but it came out. A game in which fog is the basis of map design MUST be released on PS4. this is the meaning of the generational difference. make the graphics worse so that people buy ps5. By the way, Rise of the Tomb Raider was released on xbox 360. After that, I can believe that PS4 will be able to launch super foggy Silent Hill
This game looks like a ps3 game
❤
Why does he look so depressed, like hes about to cry?
Mary..? (Then THAT drop) Title, < thats why i keep re-watching this bro
PLEASE I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR 5 MONTHS RELEASE ITT😭🙏
I hope that they will not going to degrade the graphical component of this game.
Supercar .bike.aeroplain
Train
Silent Simp
So Silent Hill Has Remake Now!
If they just do a 1 for 1 remake, I’d be happy. The same game in today’s graphics.
متى ينزل والله بيفجر الدنيا
I keep on coming back to this trailer, hoping for another one.
why wasn’t the new trailer like this?
2:38 - Eddie farting from eating too much pizza...
Saludos.
Nooooooo noooooooo nooooooooooooooo sleepless night for sure!!!!!
Ohh, ini senter dalam games Alan Wake || itu kan??
Pyramid head looks like he has a stuffed head and the woodside apartments why is there so much light? it should be difficult to even see with the torch
Can wait to see the final outcome it's long over due ❤
Too much emotion, there. Overacting.
It's nothing more than a shameful copy of the remakes of RE2 and RE4, this doesn't look anything at all like the original SH2, 0 originally from Konami as always/expected lol
This trailer is better than the recent(2024) trailer.
unos de los mejores juegos que estaba  esperando  super  de terror
Definitivamente el verdadero terror sicológico a vuelto, sin duda cuando salga esta joyita se caera internet o todos@ los que dijeron que el tráiler de combate iva ser relevante en la salida del producto final se callen la boca.... 😅✨👌🔥🔥🔥
im hearing sounds from Metal Gear 5. they used them in this trailer...
2:29 do u guys know what the soundtrack here is
what is the point of the half naked, sexualized girls tho?
Gotta tone down those colors.The original wasnt that flashy and colorful.
This trailer is so beautiful the music james everything about just make me keep coming back
no me funca,no me gusta
parasite eve..возродите эту серию.
How this trailer is better than new one
Help! 0:51 - what is this soundtrack? Seems sooo familiar, but I cant remember😢
My fave of all time
Not for $70 though sorry
I sit on pins and needles in anticipation of this masterpiece. <3<3<3
Simplemente chigon❤ al 10000% con silent Hill
That's Troy Baker? Unless they had to get a trailer guy to come in and be the voice of James as a standin.
I think 144p vhs graphics were better
Lo stiamo aspettando in tanti, per favore fate un bel lavoro 🫶🏻
I'm still going to play this game, I actually pre-ordered it, I find it odd how so many people are hating on it, but if they did everything in the original, some people would probably say Bloober copy and pasted from the original. Bloober team can't win with some people, people will get mad by anything.
Silent Hill 2 Main character hair style similar to Leon kennedy hair style
Me Gustaba más la cámara del juego De este primer avance
Is this trying to be like the Resident Evil remakes? I haven't played any Silent Hill game, but seriously.
so this is what HD nostalgia feels like
Bottom of the barrel. Are these studios that out of ideas. F*** cwinge
10M in this trailer Konami, keep working on the game don't give up , yes there's a lot of bad changes but that can be fixed, just leave it original ,fix the combat style and the Camara view .. the city and the environment looks great .
Dios, ¿Se podrían callar de una maldita vez? Es un juego con puzzles, exploración y combate. El combate es una mecánica, dejen de llorar sólo porque en el segundo trailer lo muestran todo “epico”. Parece que nunca jugaron al original, ¿Tan malo es que ahora los ataques sean más responsivos? Por dios, buaa, buaaa, buaaaa. Sólo oigo muchos lloriqueos y parloteos. No es como si James estuviera usando un maldito lanzacohetes o dando patadas, estúpidos.
The emotion in James' face is terrifyingly real.
Leon it's you?
amazing
Vengo del futuro 2024 y todavía está en desarrollo nos decepcionó amuchos fans su último triler de jugavilidad enfoque al combaté. y estará para el 2025😂😂😂
WHY BLOOBER...😢😢😢
Tan bien que estaba pintando y me la cargan con lo de el combate trailer
Whos here after they dropped the new gameplay trailer?
Cooool
Is this Re4 remake dlc
I'm not sure they really captured the essence of Silent Hill 2 with this trailer. James was always kind of a soul in limbo - he had very little fight in him and hated himself. He had an emptiness about him and was borderline insane. You rarely saw fear or strong emotions at all with him for the most part. Certainly not defiance, except in certain parts. This "I'm ready!" "I don't need you anymore!" Stuff has me worried that they are going to change the narrative.  Having said that, aside from James' very yellow hair, everything looks great so I am hopeful.
where tf is the original main theme
So this was cgi?
Bloober team 😂😂😂 I mean Konami hates Silent Hill...   Oh boy it's gonna be a failure
Nunca vou entender por que a konami não deixou esse gamer nas mãos da sony, os estúdios Sony tem maior capacidade e qualidade,
se ta louco ficou da hora obvio que precisa ainda mexer aqui ali mais ta d boa
Blooper's team
SONY : How about we sell ps2 game that was 10€ for a 100€ without putting that much effort 🤔
Blunder team
Você recebe o que espera.
Yo lloré al verlo, llevo años esperando ésto y me gustó, los verdaderos fans estarán ahí apoyando ♥️... El escenario es el mismo, el protagonista es igual, la increíble banda sonora está ahí 🖤✨ Es hermoso 🖤
There is no Arabic translation in the game!! Thank you PlayStation Thank you KONAMI 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Coming back to this beautiful trailer once more after watching the new trailer released yesterday and.... No way... Look how they massacred my boy 😢
Why does this look so much better than the new gameplay trailer at the state of play. Bloober team gaslighting us?
Man the second trailer didn’t get me half as hyped as this one. I hope they’re able to really impress us all.
Would it be great if silent hill 2 shatterred memories remastered
State of play 2024 ❤
It's kinda funny that an rtx4080  struggle to maintain 60fps with RT in 4k and UE5 Is a resource hungry engine so l.     Full disclosure the game will render 1080p to 1200p native and upscaled to 1440p@60 or 4k@30p
Oh man the new trailer ruined this one for me
Just finished watching the gameplay for this game. Wow, all the iconic scenes from the game! This remake looks amazing. I'm super happy they're doing a Silent Hill 2 remake. More Silent Hill content—who couldn't be happy for that? Thank you, Konami and the team.
Even though I enjoy the "PS1 cutscene style" face the characters from Silent Hill 1 and 2 have very much, I love how James looks like an average depressed dad here. His face is great :D
Silent Hill 2 PS3 Remake
Is this supposed to be the same game for which you demonstrated that inexplicable gameplay on state of play? I suppose not.
Silent Mid 2
Flopped
Şu Oyun çıksın merakla bekliyorum kendimi Oyunun içine gömmek istiyorum Mükemmel bir oyun olacak umarım
A MAIOR PROPAGANDA ENGANOSA DE REMAKE DOS VIDEOGAMES
I wish I could unsee the new trailer that just released
Not a bit surprised since Bloober has never done a game of this caliber. Still have to give them credit for willing to try something beyond of their comfort zone for better or worse unlike what MachineGames is doing for Indiana Jones.
Wow 10M de visitas se viene tremendo remake
They better not mess this up.
Just came back from watching the State Of Play, I can not wait anymore for this game to release. I'm so stoked!!!!
been waiting so long for this game on ps4... well, for some years to buy ps5 xd
Dogshit.
WHY DOES THIS TRAILER LOOK BETTER THAT THE ONE WE GOT TODAY ??? FALSE ADVERTISEMENT????
For some reason it looks like a resident evil gameplay with Leon 😂
DON'T GET ALL HOLY ON ME, JAMES
and the fnaf 10?
Honestamente no me gustó el tráiler, James ni siquiera se parece... yo diría que es León de RE4 con hepatitis 😂😂😂
This game will be released today!
É hoje rapaze, confia que hoje no State Of Play vai sair a data de lançamento desse game haha, estou empolgado!
1:32 What happened?
NÃO EXISTE JOGO MELHOR QUE ESSE...
O melhor jogo já criado....
Boy got the same haircut as Leon
State of play
STATE OF PLAY 2024❤
State Of play 2024 please release date!!!
STATE OF PLAY ❤
Holy cow!  They're finally getting desperate, it's about time!
Konami needed to make a master collection that fixes the wrongs of the silent hill hd collection before dropping this cause we need more people to experience the original versions of peak. I have no idea how this remake will end up (cautiously optimistic) but i know there were ideas that never made it to the final release that could be added like red pyramid thing chasing you around the apartments for example that would be cool to see implemented. If they made the ogs more accessible I think many people would be more open to the changes that this remake will bring. This will replace the 2001 version for many people so I can only hope that somehow this shines bright.
Ya esta a nada de ser 2 de que salió este trailer, no me había defraudado, y la música prometía bastante
Don't let them forget what they took From kojima, from del toro, from Norman redus, from US. Never let them forget.
when? im still waiting...
la cucaracha la cucaracha
Porque não começar pelo Silent Hill 1?
State of play is coming. 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Trailer of 2001 is better
Fun fact: Silent Hill 1 Came Out The Year I Was Born In 1999 And that's Not A Coincidence (I'm A 1999 Born gen Z Baby)
Hopefully they are play testing it before release.
News about SILENT HILL 2?dajeeee
Black fairy here I come
Needs a date! My PS5 is a Bloodborne machine at this point.
Man I spent countless hours playing Silent Hill on PS1
10 million views for the greatest game ever and counting , cant wait to play this masterpiece
remember that the actor/model could've Norman Reedus.
太棒了
WHEN
I'm 23, and remember playing this game on my old PS2 when I was like 12 years old. Time freakin flies man, gonna be a blast to try this out again:)
Kenapa silenthill ps1 gk di remake
MIRDA KONAMI YA SACALOOO
Konami can you please do a remake of Silent Hill 1. You did the Metal Gear solid collection (ps5) all i want is Silent Hill 1 remake and of course Silent Hill 2
Can't wait to pre order it
Just finished this game it was a masterpiece....... I wish remake will be faithful to original
I love how this is called a "Teaser" Trailer when it's just a Trailer Trailer.
Is this game real or this is scam like The Day Before? I am looking for any gameplay.
One aspect I miss is the more stoic, slightly desaturated skin, and somewhat  depressed look in the eyes of the original character designs. Also if you see the original trailer the grime, and grain of the bathroom scene is better.
Bro this game is soo nostalgic 😢 , I still remember those days playing silent hill .
Yoooo finally broke 10 million views
ME VOY A CAGAR A PATAS
waiting...
Please use the original musics pf the game, at least the main track !
Konami still seems to have not understood that the secret of a character's success is to be handsome. For example, Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid 4 was old, but he was handsome, or Raiden is the most handsome character in Metal Gear Solid series
In the original version, James was 29 years old, his face had no wrinkles, he was tall and had a larger body, and he was very handsome and had an innocent voice. But this character I see in SH2R is more like a moving corpse
I really love silent hill 2, but this is not it 🥲
He goes to the same hairdresser as Leon Kennedy 💇🏼‍♂️
Replaying  this now and I can definitely tell you i've been scared a few times. The noises are horrendous especially playing in the dark.😢😢 But I love it.
Having just finished the original, I must say I'm crazy excited for this one now. Everything looks amazing and true to the source, so far.
2:22 Promise from Silent Hill  2:31 piano
IN MY RESTLESS DREAMS I SEE THAT TOWN 🗣🗣🗣
Still waiting... 😅
If this is for real i can't wait
اللعبه هذي كيف اقدر انزلها عندي ف سوني 4 ؟؟
ولا ازال انتظر
Let’s goooooo!!
Go Bloober Team- go Poland on one of my favourite stories ever.
WHEEEEEEEEEEEEN
Happy 10 Million Views!!!
Quiero llorar
The GAOT horror game ever is Back
I’m sorry but this  REALLY needed to be a new Silent Hill game, not a remake.  That’s why Konami never made a new Silent Hill game in a long time;  they’re out of ideas!
..Interesting how this trailer starts with a cockroach crawling - like the image of a cockroach wasn't indicative of.... P.T... Just saying..  Can't wait for this though! Playing through my Director's Cut bombshell of a PS2 version I have, at the moment! LET'S GOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It wasn’t until recent years I’ve become invested into Silent hill games… but now I can finally play one of them!! 👀
Hopefully they will remake all the silent hill series soon, silent hill 4 was the best for me with so many memories❤
James..grandfa?
I'm so excited but also terrified to see Maria again ❤❤❤
10 million views for this masterpiece 🥲
In my restless dreams, I see that town silent hill. You promise to take me there but you never did. Well I’m here now in our secret place.. waiting for you.
SAL YA!!
when this game will release?
I can't wait to experience my favourite horror again ❤
You better give us news very soon. I'm not kidding with you rn
Çık artık mk
Goooooooosebumps
Eeeeek exciting
Hope it’s a fps shooter
Can’t wait to play dis
Esperando
Predic: sera exito y ganara goty.
Wow
10 MILLION VIEWS !!! 🎉
his wife is hot
Days Gone 2   Pleace 😢✨
Is this still coming out?
I cant wait
We reached 10m views!
I think we're in for something not far from a miracle with the 10 million view benchmark for this trailer because If it sales at least 1 million copies: This would match the original's performance and recoup potential development costs. 2-5 million copies: This range aligns with successful AAA remakes and demonstrates solid commercial performance. Over 5 million copies: This would be an exceptional outcome, signifying a major revival for the Silent Hill franchise.  If at least half of everyone that watched this trailer gives it a try and buys it, we can revive the Franchise and I'll have to apologize to Konami, which is something I plan to do in my afterlife.
Im so worried about this game. It seems the blooper team is gonna ruin this
10 MILLIONS!! 💚
She could really here?.....waiting for me?
10M 🎉
this is great and all but the system requirements are insane.
So when’s this game actually gonna release?
i hope they can pull this out because this is THE horror game
Uaalll esse é a franquia mais linda q existe !!!
The baby faces they give men in "games" today..
Idk, the old graphics are just better in my opinion. Something about it i can't explain.
My favorite silent hill game 😢❤
Dino crisis
I never played the original so I'm looking forward to seeing what makes this Yahtzee's favorite game.
Silent Hill 1 too please?
This game is out
I have the original Silent Hill 2 on the Original Xbox. It's backwards compatible on the Xbox 360 but not the Xbox One or Series X/S wish it was tho that would be great. I also have Silent Hill 4 on the Original Xbox and Silent Hill 3 on PS2 with the Soundtrack. I can't wait for this Remake. I would suggest anyone interested in this to pre-order it because the Silent Hill games go for a very high dollar amount on the 2nd hand maket so once this goes out of print it may end up being very hard to find or very expensive.
I will buy PS5 when SH2 come out. I swear.
Silent Hill 2 is already perfect. We need a remake of "Silent Hill 1"
و لا ازال انتظر
крутая игрушка из детства
i hope they understand what every enemy represents, especially pyramid head as they have turned that guy into more of a mascot than the powerful character he is
I never played this but I’m looking forward to it after watching the trailer on the ps store
In my Restlest dreams i see you coming   Very soon State of Play 2024❤️❤️
I wonder if they're gonna put the dog ending in this one?
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ojalá no decepcione, silent hill 2 es una obra maestra del terror
RELEASE IT ALREADY KONAMI I'M GOING INSANE!!!!!
Esperando por el mejor juego de terror de la historia
Buenas referencias a P.T.😂
Konami games are special. The team that created Silent Hill. I would still like  Silent Hill 1 remake which I think is due and the fans would love it. Let's have a Silent Hill 1 remake with Harry Mason
Technická otázka poběží v 60fps? Nebo 120 fps?
they have no clue what made the original great, and it's obvious.
i'd love a quick switcheroo and it ends up being silent hills instead
Dumpster fire incoming
I've been worried for this remake since it was announced, especially after the mirror scene, it misses the whole point of that scene. He's not supposed to be worried or scared, he's supposed to be disassociating, and feeling his face to check if he's really there or not.
Its been a year lol when is it coming out
he look like Harrison Ford , no offence
Coming to PC as well, already on my wishlist on Steam
Seems we are getting Silent Hill 2 and Resident Evil 7 in steroids for this one.
Ive wanted to play this game for a really long time now but its so rare ive had no opportunities.  I cant wait for the release of this game!!!
Goty 2024
*sees a closeup of a cockroach* sick pt reference
Silent Hill 2>>All Resident games
If they don't censor it with woke filth... I'll absolutely buy it.
;m ao wxcited!
Not even close to the oryginal version trailer
Can’t wait for this banger !
yay!!! ❤❤
Knowing that Blooper is developing the remake worries me a little. I hope this remake captures the same feeling the original does.
Will Konami get over Capcom?
We’re still waiting 😭
the greatest game of all time returns.
Is it a remake or another actual silent hill game?
10 million views... WOW
No, BGM is wrong. Character Design is wrong. This is not the  Silent Hill Style.
We are impatiently waiting for this game 🤯🤯
2024 🙌🏻🔥🥳
I Hope That In The Remake We Can Go To Places That Were locked In The Original Game Like Silent Hill Ranch Also The Toluca Lake Rebirth Church Or Lakeside Amusement Park And Maybe Add A Battle Mode Like For Example The Mercenaries From Resident Evil
That's what we get when you hire a bunch of cheap superficial shallow-thinking people from Eastern Europe.
Leon kennedy leon kennedy
This character model looks crappie to me, his face looks  weird, sorry but those are facts
Will this be on xbox?
I was playing the original back in the day during a thunderstorm with my friends and I don't remember what part of the game it happened but something happened that made us jump and then the power went out because of the storm and it freaked us out, bad lol I'm stoked for this new one.
I've never actually played silent hill I've played resident evil but never silent hill I might check this out.
Here let’s make it a even more of a masterpiece make it the same old voice actors and voice lines but remaster the graphics and get rid of the bugs and keep everything from the old game
Ich kack ab
I gotta admit as much as I feared this game when I played it on the original PS2... I thought I'd never see the day for a remaster! I always wondered if it was coming on ps3... But nothing... PS4.... Nope... I think Sony made the solid choice of keeping it for ps5 where the console has incredible specs to really make us feel inside of the game! This will definitely bring new ps5 gamers no doubt! I don't have a ps5 yet but this being a sony exclusive... Is definitely paving the way! Can't wait to play it. I wasn't supposed to play this game at 10-13 years old because of the rating LOL but I had my sister sit next to me because I was so freaked out of the game but I wanted to beat it!!!! It was the most nightmarish game for me but in it I found that facing our fears is the ONLY thing we can do. And once again we are going to back to visit silent hill... In our restless dreams where we see that town 🥲it was so scary for me that at one point I turned off the sound effects of the game to avoid jump scares BUT I turned it back on lol I faced my fears!!!! Heading that radio everytime those monsters were near always gave me anxiety but man oh man.... This is gonna be an insane remaster!
the graphic is amazing, but they should not have changed the music.
Скажите выйдет ли на пк??
Я не верю
Is this game only in PS5 ? Could any chance that it will get a port to PC ?
I'm really happy this game is coming out, I feel like it will make Silent Hill popular again <33
That baseball bat beating scene shocked my azz in ways i cant describe. Im still shocked reflecting on seeing that. Just seeing a woman being bludgeoned to death with a bat, pipe, or anythng, just makes a horror scene freightening....let alone half naked, wet, splattered with blood, dirt, and who knows what else, squirming to get away, putting up a fight, is just horrorfying to see. I forgot this is a PlayStation game.  Then the call words spoken "PlayStation" at the end like that...did very little to bring me back to my senses its a game.
This was the best game of the series!
1 year and almost 10 million views. In my restless dreams I see that release date... Silent hill remake.  I'm ready... Mary
Este juego será realmente malo, pero lo voy a comprar para apoyar a silent hill y no dejar que muera otra vez con la esperanza de que hagan un port de los primeros 4 juegos.
Nostalgia silent hil
James looks like a japanese dude playing as an American dude
It bothers me that he touches he’s face while looking in the mirror as opposed to moving his hand in front of his face.
예전 그 녹슨 동전 같은 느낌은 없는것 같아...
a graça do silent hil e resident evil era as camera antigas que ficavam paradas. apos isso mudar no 4 o jogo foi só ladeira abaixo. que saudade dos jogos antigos,   resident evil 1, 2, 3, codigo veronica,  silent hill, e dino crisis 1, 2. era jogos de verdade. nem todo jogo tem que ter obrigatoriamente a camera em 3ª pessoal.,
And we’re still waiting for some news 💀
Hypado por Silent Hill 2 Remake. Os SH 1, 3 e 4 precisam d remakes também. O SH4 é o meu favorito, joguei ele incontáveis vezes no PS2. Vai ser irado este SH2 Remake. Podem fazer sem pressa para que saia um ótimo game, feliz ano novo a toda equipe.
please give it to me Rachel
متى تنزل اللعبه
Still waiting
Just bought a PS5 JUST for this. And Tekken 8.
James is supposed to be 35 but he looks at least 10 years older here.
This better not be canceled
Man this brings me back to my childhood, makes me so excited
So like is this super delayed now or did they just outright cancel it?
Release date plz
release game pls
WHEEEEN????
sumpah Aku tidak pernah menamatkan game silent hill mulai dari ps2,ps3 itu karena gamenya sulit terungkap berbeda dengan Resident Evil yg tujuannya jelas🤨
The town i remember ..different dimension
Not again...
So has this been scrapped yet?
The VA 🤮🤮
Imagine how much has happened across the world in the past 14 months. Wars have broken out, populations have increased and Covid made its final insignificant remark on the globe. Meanwhile, these morons at Bloober Team have just been sucking their thumbs in all that time and now they're embarrassed to even make any public announcements that their game is going to either be severely delayed or cancelled outright.
pero creo q podrian incluir el español en el idioma de dialogos, ya veremos...
q ganas de jugar con el en las VR2... es q lo 1ero q hare es ir a pyramid head para pedirle 1 autografo... aunke me mate
Тревожный...
لا أمل من مشاهدة
No matter how much I love Silent Hill - I still consider them more of interactive movies, rather than real video games. You don't really do that much by yourself, but rather watch cutscenes.  Still magic though. Pure magic.
i'll Always Wait for you.....Everyday i check for News or Come back to the Trailer
I'm here and waiting for You I'll wait Forever for You....❤️
I m still waiting:))
Nooo don't go there... Never again
I want it!!!🎉
is there any new news on this game?, just saw that the pre orders are up
James, you made me happy
Some of you people are insane!  The Silent Hill series is and always will be EPIC!
No se como no los demandan por monopolyo por hacer este tipo de juegos exclusivos para su plataforma de mrda
Best trailer oever gives me chills
Im replaying Sh 2 again after 12 years and for me this trailer is lacking of darkness and „dirt” i think all fans know what im up to. Sh 2 was like a restless dream.
my pooke  bear
These people just don't get SH2. This is terrible!
Have you already decided when you are going to release out the game?
P.T. 😢😢😢💔
2:19 you can faintly hear his screams
words cannot explain the hype i'm feeling
Neat looking game. I hope James Finds Mary and they both live happily in the end :)
PlayStation
Where's the fcking new trailer
Maria con una mano en el corazón...
We still waiting
Why start the remaster at the second sequel
i really wish their voices were kinda uncanny like the og but other than that i can’t stop watching this trailer
Will they gonna make a remake of silent hill 2 3 4 in one edition like metal gear solid??
They cancelled P.T. and now they are remaking Silent Hill 2? What brought about this change?
Patiently waiting 😢for
This game is never coming out at this point lol
Se ve barato y con poca alma. Debió haberlo hecho un estudio de sony.
Don’t touch that dial now…
Боже...юность моя
Alan wake and silent hill are the best in horror category.
Yey. Now remake Suikoden 2!!!!!
Estou mais ansioso por ele do que o gta 6
This makes me hope for a movie!
My body is ready
I think you guys should have used Ryan Gosling face for James because James new face is awful and u..y
Bro got to leon mode
Is this coming out??
I hope this is not representative of the music and tone of the remake. And that they’ll change the face, the overacting, the overdramatization. This is exactly how not to do it, you lose so much of what made it great and just into another banal psychological horror.
“The gap between the door is a separate reality!”
LOL. This looks silly.
I've never played the Silent Hill before, where can I buy the original games?
The original sucked, hopefully this remake is half decent
F YOU KONAMI IT'S BEEN 1 YEAR !
Блять что у него с лицом? Почему он такой старый? Почему он такой худой? Штаны не те, какие-то слишком узкие. Ботинки вообще другие. У оригинального Джэймса не было столько жалости на лице. Исправьте это всё. Исправьте косяки геймплэя оригинала и дополните повествование и дело в шляпе
Another eastern eauropean trashy adaptation of that legendry japanese video game... Dosn't have the silent hill vibe at all
🤷🏾‍♂️ still no release 🤷🏾‍♂️
Yup, 1 year after and here we are... Still, I want this game to be fully concluded and the experience to be immaculate near perfection if possible. So, I'm ready to wait another year or as long as it takes to get those wishes hopefully fulfilled...                -  S I L E N T 🪳 H I L L  2  remake -
1 year ;-;
1 year ago we get a teaser, but still no announcement or game
Porfavor qu3 salga bien , amo este juego y ni lo jugue😢❤
Should I play the original before this (never have) or just play this one on release??
Por qué el personaje tiene cara de japonés? No era norte americano??
They lost Kojima. They have to remember something 😂
fk konami
2:00 This is pretty much all castlevania fans that are still waiting for Konami to make a new castlevania game...
Moment of *silence* on a hill for those who passed away waiting for the new next-gen of this phenomenon game.
HURRY UP PLEAAE
the fear of blood tends to create fear for the flesh
Still waiting this game 🥲🤍
this is called graphics
Nothing at Game award .. seriously .. 14 months ..
I do have one question for japanese based video games.  Why do they always use a white / western protagonist. As a white American great but it is odd no?? What if all American video games had Asian title characters. Weird right ??
so it's been more than 13 months and yet there is no update of this. not in ps showcase, not in the game awards. none.
DAY 414 GIVE IT UP FOR DAY 414!
I was expecting to see a trailer in The Game Awards😓😓
Maybe we will get P.T in a couple of years? No just kidding lol were never getting P.T😮‍💨
They try to get that PT Intro with the cockroach...  Its like they want to make us feel that they can pull what Hideo Kojima, and Guillermo were going to make with PT.  Maybe not identical, but hopefully something as close.
Looks epic konami
These devs don't know of subtlety. Just look at the LOOK HOW SAD I AM -expressions
All I need is to sell a kidney to afford a PS5
Most disgusting main hero face in game history award!
DAY 413 GIVE IT UP FOR DAY 413!
When is this coming?
need days gone 2
Ese no es la continuación del ps2 donde sale un tipo de lentes buscando asu hija en hielo
It's been a year what's the word on this game
I dont like james"s expressions :(
Why not number 1
When is this out
Bring back PT
This trailer looks terrible. This is going to be a lazy cash grab.
No one is talking about the important issues, like whether this will include the dog ending and UFO ending.
Is that leon ??
Pourquoi le 2 ? Le premier est aussi bien.
The face and character look too emotional and lack the dark , emptiness and suffering of original.  It will sure have better gameplay and combat but thats not the soul of SH2.  I like the canceled verison of SH more.
At 2:17 Re2 Birkin shouting G is my creation 😂
In-Game-Store, Pay to Win + 50 DLC´s and this game is perfect ! I ♥ Capitalism !
What a joke! Next to zero news.
im glad  that akira yamaoka's music is still going tobe in remake
Y el 1? :O
Silent Hill 2 and Clock Tower remastered have me excited for 2024.
Ugh. It’s the HD Collection all over again 🤮🙄
esto es mejor que el cine!
😮😮
In my resled dreams ... I dont see this game   You promise me konami   A year has been past .
Dont forget they canceled Silent Hills
No silent hill 1?
One full year and the official trailer has not come out yet
Yall best keep the music the same bro
Anyone know when it’s coming to Xbox?
It's so foggy...
I really hope to be wrong (I would be happy if that's the case) but I think there is a high possibility for this to be canceled 😢😢
Sony😊
Please remake 1 too
Such a brilliant,emotional, heartbreaking trailer. Can't wait to play remake of my favorite Silent Hill game.❤❤❤
I wait this long time 😢
Its about godamn time
When does it come out? It's been a whole year since the trailer.
Muito massa!!
Definitely not the same as Silent Hill PT where you felt the horror, intense fear, jump and shake. This Silent hill lost that feeling, we will never see that scary game anymore since it is not the same designer with the amazing ideas of what the fear really is, I am not happy with this game, and I think I am not the only one.   If you really know about what a scary game is, you know what I mean.
I don’t even have a PS5 to begin with and I’m still going to buy the game for keeps! 😅
where the Fck is it ?!?
I miss old James voice, he sound so innocent, this one is old and rugged
penca la wea
People dont realize this is a teaser trailer so if some of the scenes are different here doesnt mean they will be when its released
on gma
January 2024
I'm convinced this is just another fever dream. it's been over a year and we haven't even gotten so much as an update on this game....
Will be game of the year ! 💯
Completely unecessary, but its a start. Hopefully this game does well... Then may we can finally get a proper hd remaster of silent hill 2.
I really don't trust this. This remake smells sus.  I hope to be wrong.
release date ?
I cant wait for that staircase
Espero que el juego dure unas 15 horas
...take my money.  Thank you, Konami, for doing something  with this wonderful franchise.
Nie mogę się doczekać😉chce wrócić do Silent Hill💪💪
is this remake ?
1 year and a month later, still no release date
I can't believe they're messing with the soundtrack...I get the idea behind it, modernizing and having better software to make it but the lo-fi, hazy synth version was way better at setting mood...
Lets hope is an improvement and not a downgrade of the original game. Please.. Mary Jane.. where.. have you been
It better have the dog ending.
Man they should make silent hill pt
чет какой то кринж а не UE5
Один из лучших игровых хороров мир!!!❤😱😱😱
Ja passou 1 ano Konami quero atualizações minha nobre
James design looks more old and less anime like. That's pretty weird, but it's cool.
One of the best stories ever told. The sadness, melancholy, sorrow and psychological symbolism in Silent Hill 2 is second to none!
where are you baby
Cant waiiiiiiit !
Manusia
Manusia manusia
Bro got the Leon haircut
finally
with this graphic i can watch it as a movie
He looks really miserable...  Its perfect❤❤❤
i have played the original, got every final. i can say that this game will be a bombshell
this is definitely gonna get canned lol just wait
Hope this game has a battle pass, on line multiplayer, live chat and pay to win packs like the new garbage twitch like short movie called ascension, I can’t wait for Konami to kill metal gear too with a similar thing
how has it already been a year since this trailer came out
Das in vr ufff
If it's not Silent Hills idc
GTA 6 is revealed don't care about this anymore
Unreal engine everywhere
lança logoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
They don't make them like they used to... should make a new Silent Hill for PS4 & PS5.. to many remake games now..🤔
Every day I come here and watch this masterpiece. I just love Silent Hill 2. It's the best game i've ever played, and this is the best video game trailer of all time, in my opinion. Please, Bloober Team, do a great job!   PS: I probably watched this trailer a thounsand times. I'm not joking lol. It simply never gets boring.
I'm pretty happy they taking their times instead of rushing things out
Who's watching this after finishing Alan Wake 2 ?
We need this and skate 4
La música de piano es la que te extrémecia , y en ningún momento la escuche
Desde que NO ESTÁ LA MÚSICA original ya no anima
I wish they kept the original soundtracks. They were awesome.
Don't like how they changed the 🎼🎶Music🎶🎼 ESPECIALLY the Opening Mirror scene!! Cant wait to play it.
Man i hope they also remake SH1. Can’t just skip the OG that started it all.
Bitte mit deutscher Sprachausgabe
Evil within copied silent hill
Why does he look so much like Leon Kennedy? Lol
Its been over a year Konami, give us something.  I know you updated the steam achievments.
RIP TO waiters and believers, im with ya guys <3
it’s been more than a year…. what happened?
Let hope konami dont end up scraping this one
Another remastered game?or new?
James Sunderland is the new gta 6 protagonist 😂
James is too expressive, this takes away some of the misrtey and ambiguity that made special the original game
After playing Alan Wake 2, the bar has been raised for the survival horror games that have a slower pace with less combat (than the likes of Resi). I hope this is a lot more than just SH2 with an updated engine!
*Making James stumble in shaking, looking guilty of something terrible is a BAD choice. Almost ruins the twist right at the start.* 🤦🏽
The Nostalgia strikes again..
I hate Konami so much :(
The OG silent hill 2 appears more scarier and sinister looking than the SH2 Remake its looking like a American horror movie  a bad taste to true Survival Psychological Horror fans LOL
Goosebump
Nice I'm waiting but how many remakes??? Best 2 horrors for ps5 Alan Wake 2 and The Callisto protocol, rest is remakes, only remakes without fresh idea...
I have goosebumps everywhere..
Can you hurry up with this already!!
What if Konami celebrates  SH2 remake by creating a knife with the strength of Giant Knife shrunk into a size of butter knife.
oh boy im so ready
And pt?😭💔😔
I have a bad feeling after see what happened with Silent hill ascension .
Theme of Laura
Release date pls 😢
I am unbelievably hyped for this I have no words. My favourite horror game ever. I hope they pull this off and do it justice. If they do this will be incredible. If they do what Capcom has done for the RE remakes this’ll be amazing for SH fans.
YA QUE SALGA CARAJOSOSSSSSS
I envy those who don’t know who pyramid head is
I am curious how Maria is going to sound in this game. Definitely needs to be seductive and playful!
So this all was Just a prank
Bro I'm so excited for this gameeeeeeeeee c'monnn when will it be outtt???
Can we get a guarantee from the dev that it’s not going to be a woke game?  Seriously there needs to start being a “woke rating” label on games now.
Vai ser TOP!
Correct me if I'm wrong but it's for ps5 only?
Dude This makes me cry everytime Cant believe we are going to see sh2 again  Counting the seconds for it 🙏🏻
Please tell me, what is the name of the music at the moment 2:30?
ok but 2:38 made me cackle and took me out of the moment - it legit sounds like someone let one rip directly into a microphone and turned up the reverb. (I swear I am an a adult...)
Coming here after the godawful ascension
Bruh where tf is the game
Please keep the original soundtrack
Eu confio em vocês Bloober Team
Cuando sale esta Mierda, almenos queremos noticias 😢
Será que supera Allan wake 2
Queria a voz deles original 😢
Todo dia tô vindo aqui. Que ansiedade!!!
No Theme of Laura?!?!!?
Makes you wonder about the original developer's of this game maybe they just don't have what it takes anymore. The Japanese seem to be slipping in the video game industry. Even China is making their consoles for them now.
imagina os requisitos do jogo para pc. melhor nem pensar. rtx 4090.
BLUD WHEN WILL IT DROP BLUD ITS BEEN A YEAR
Every five to ten years, a Silent Hill trailer would come out showcasing the latest technology, but for real game? Nah.
I'm gonna be that guy and say that I am not entirely a fan of the face structure changes on James and Mary.
i watch this at least once a week
It’s been One year what the hill ?!💀💀💀💀💀
Caralho, mal posso esperar pra jogar mais uma vez essa obra prima do survival horror. E adoro o fato que a Sony está lançando para PC tbm, excelente decisão. Todos merecem passar pela experiência de jogar esse clássico readaptado com o hardware moderno.
ارجوكم اللغة العربية 💔🥹
Ojalá usen el audio original de Mary para el inicio y el final, la voz nueva no pega mucho
Cara, eu achei tudo muito bom. Eu tô com muitas boas expectativas sobre esse remake.
That guy can't be James Sunderland
Por favor, lança logo!!!!! :(
I hope it comes out soon
WHEN?😭😭😭😭
I wish if the developers could have a seniors that we can play as Angela, Mary,Maria, and Eddie
I was really hoping for Theme of Laura at the end of the trailer.
I hope this silence about this game means that Konami will use a replacement actor for James, a younger actor with a better voice because Luke Roberts was a really bad choice for James Sunderland.
I don't understand why James Sunderland has changed from a 20-year-old to a 60-year-old man? At least you would have made James into a handsome old man, but you didn't do that either
Alan Wake is even more handsome than Hollywood actors, but James Sunderland has a really bad face and cannot be tolerated at all.
Just replayed the original on PS2 and and the HD collection on PS3 just to get myself even more hyped for the remake!
I would love to see a Silent Hill Master Collection as well. If they can do it for Metal Gear, then they might as well for Silent Hill.
The only SH I've played is Homecoming and I enjoyed it. I've been looking to buy the originals but they are so expensive. Should I wait for the remake instead?
Ight bro when is it coming out 😐
I’m happy to see a remastered of silent hill 2 but I really hoped that mads mikkelsen would play the role of James
Você estaria mesmo aqui, remake de silent hill 2. Vc foi anunciando a 1 ano, como isso é possível?
1 year no updates
Octubre is almost gone and we have yet to receive any news about this game
I hope this game come on xbox..😢 I'm an old fan of it but I can't afford ps5 a have series s
here is to hoping we get some news about this game soon. Another trailer would be cool, a demo would be amazing.
when will they drop another trailer?
Eyes without faace 😞
I guess mobile games and pachinko machines aren’t hitting like Konami thought they would.   Cancelling Silent Hills just to do another unoriginal remake in a era of countless remakes.
Not sure how they expected an indie studio known for walking simulators to somehow be able to develop a passable remake of one of the best horror games ever made.
Cancelled
CANCEL IT CANCEL IT
Ya cumplio un año ya queremos nuevas noticias😢😢
Ja fazem 84 anos que a gente teve uma noticia a respeito
Yo you guys have any updates on it? When will it come out dammit
Lo han sacado ya o que coño?
It's been a year now since this announcement, and for a year nothing. Not even single new screenshot... :/
Happy 1 year
Happy 1 year anniversary lads! 🍻
1 year Anniversary here 👉🏻🥳
1 year later and I have watched this trailer like 25 times I just love it that much. Can’t wait for this game.
1 Year Anniversary, thanks konami 😢
happy 1 year 😞 hope they’re taking their sweet time with this game and haven’t just left it
bu oyun çıktığında makarnanla beni bul. Bugün birinci yılı....
Its been a year and no update. Lets face it this is no longer happening guys :(
1 año y todavía no sabemos nada de nada
Really hope we hear something about this soon.
Officially been 1 year was hoping we’d hear some new by now smh
Boom, it has been 1 year since the transmission, and BAM has nothing new from Konami 😅
1 year after the release of this teaser, we're here and we're waiting for some news
If this is done right, we could have ourselves a Silent Hill Game Of The Year!
Exactly a year later, still need that release date 😓
Masterpiece 💙
Checkin the comments from 2022 it's baldin millennials with pathetic lives clingin into this with a Stockholm Syndrome so strong it could be a Silent Hill boss. The 2023 comments r zoomers who found out bout the franchise through tiktok sounds and LoFi mixes. What a time to be alive
i can’t believe it’s been a whole year since we got this now
And so I wait, wrapped in my cocoon of pain and loneliness. Waiting for this game, but they never release it.
I Wish All Games From This Play Station 5 Is Become Remake Idol Dude 😁 😁
In my restless dreams i see myself playing this game
That's not James's they did his face wrong
If anyone is interested I made this look even better using AI it's ony my channel.
Hmmm...... Yeah I don't trust this. No offense to the people who are excited, but considering this is Konami we're talking about and the fact that Bloober Team is developing the remake, I can't help but be cautious about this. Hopefully I'm wrong, but I'm just going to stay on the fence until then.
Bruh, they made a screamer out of PS logo.
Esse jogo é lendário mesmo. Envolvente e cada vez que se joga, parece tudo novo.
yay
in three days this trailer is gonna be one year old, and we still haven't received proper news or a release date
I watched blue velvet Jacobs ladder and Twin Peaks S1-S3 and "fire walk"... Soooo where are you James?...Please come see me..Don't you want to see me?..James..I'm waiting...
Nice, I'll play the free version on PC
Why did they model James after the main character from Silent Hill Downpour?
Nunca pensé que llegaría este día  😢😮
Minha franquia favorita e resident evi mas esse salent Hill é muito da hora....preciso jogar ....mas ainda não tenho um ps5😢
This is either going to be fantastic, or absolutely terrible.  Konami, please don't let us down.
Masterrrpieceeee if they do it right just like the original
*also available on PC thanks playstation :D
How does it somehow look way worse than the original
Precisamos de um jogo de terror de verdade! Que realmente dê medo e arrepios. Espero que esse seja assim
I hope we get the full movie soundtrack in the full release
That hil.. over there. Is silent.. 2
Va a ser horriblemente aterrador hasta la película del exorcista va a quedar chica con este remake este si que va a dar miedo angustia desesperación que brutalidad tan genial han creado
Hi could my drawings be a background artist in different views
looking like Keanu Reaves
Pena que vai sair só pro ps5 em 1200p.😂
You're as beautiful as the day I lost you
حزب الشبيحة الجدد نبيها بسرعه
It's too bad Silent Hill is about to be turned into a generic Resident Evil game, according to the people remastering it.
Another days goes by we sit here waiting for any info at all. Any statement would be nice.
Compraré un playstation 5 solo por jugar este juego ...
Ngl I’m starting to worry about this game. I hope everything is going okay behind the scenes. I did hear rumors were finally getting an update this month if I end up being wrong, sue me…..I just don’t want another PT please.
Konami faz o PT SILENT HILLS 😕
This is one of the strangest release timelines' I've ever seen. Absolutely no info has come out, killing the momentum. I would've thought a property as well established as this would have timeline that followed successful advertising campaigns such as capcom's RE4R and especially SF6 this year. I hope they know what they're doing because, while this trailer is great, the lack of information does not convey this feeling
A week away from the one year anniversary, still nothing :(
I hope we see some gameplay soon I am starting to worry about this game tbh.
James Sunderland was one of the most handsome protagonists of Silent Hill, but now he is no more. So what is going to happen to Henry Townshend and Harry Mason? Konami, please don't make Henry Townshend ugly
Graphics look PS3
Where is this game??
hubieran concluido SILLENT HILL PT
This videogame will be avaible at same time the movie. In others words on 04.26.2024
So happy so eager so ready to go back to silent hill
PS5 Day 1! I'm getting Pizza popcorn sodas!
So where's the gameplay?
Restless Dreams
This was THE silent hill to me.
Pqp esse jogo vai ser maravilhoso esperei tanto por esse remake
Ждём ❤
My favourite horror franchise of all time
It's going to be like Silent Hill downpour, and I loved that title, finally something like that experience!
Silent Hill are not games.  They are tools. Tools to make us understand ourselves, aswell as life. Like for example that it is never black and white.
Who’s ready for the 1 year anniversary of the trailer?
I NEED IT.
Face model needs changing bad.
Yooo
cant wait to see silent hill fan in agony.
GIVE IT TO ME
It's almost 1 year about this trailer..... i think we deserve something about this soon.....
6 months ago, it had 6.5 or 7 million views, and now it's at 9.1 million. Will it reach 10 million, and the game has not been released yet?
It is strange that the last comment I made was 6 months ago, and I remember that I was excited for its release, and now the enthusiasm has increased even more. I do not know why, but I am excited and it increases with time.
Finally thank you Konami!
Need a gameplay trailer and release date come on
So... is this game coming out? 💀
DROP THIS NOOOOOWWWW
"Я ждал это время и вот это время пришло." Не терпится окунуться в этот мир снова.
Its hard to explain, but James in the remake looks like a Jpop star who went off the grid after he turned 40 😅
"I'm not your Mary."
???
I bought the PS5 for this
I will buy PS5 only to play this game . Among all the other games Silent Hill series are my favorite one.
im still waiting fot the game u.u
Imagine if purgatory was like silent hill, yeah i probably wouldn't make it
Strangely, James Sunderland has an old and bad face in Silent Hill 2 Remake, but in Return To Silent Hill, James has a beautiful face like Prince Charming 😂
If I were Bloober Team, I'd use a handsome 30-year-old white man with an angular face for James Sunderland's face model, just like Capcom did with Leon Kennedy
I don't like James' new face. Bad casting and bad voice actor
Вот бы первую часть ремейкнули
Mais donnez nous la date 😡
It's going to get to the point that things are so real only sick people will play your game...
Wheeerreeee?
It would be epic if they plan silent hill 3 remake
Alan Wake 2 is lot better than this shit
Silent hill remake, MGS remake.. I'm 44 and having wet dreams again 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Release date was 3 days ago and still the game is not out why?
Some of theses stories in games always have the same beginning
I am curious to see the final "Dog" with the Shiba
Im waiting for it to get cancelled at this point
They better actually meet.
Now can you transfer the old Silent hill 2 and 3 to ps4 like what they did with final fantasy 7 and the final fantasy 7 remake??….
I’m excited to play this. I played SH1 on the PS1 but never got a chance to play SH2 so this is really great news to see a remake on the horizon.
You can do it Bloober
Pls do silent hill origins and silent hill 1 😢
This game is never coming out is it 😢
This town is full of monsters. How can you sit there and eat pizza?!
Welp looks like I’m gonna have to buy a PS5 now 😂💯
I am so HYPE!
Never forget P.T. and Kojima. Also Fk Konami
favorite part
Leon S Kennedy during his tennage age.
Cheryl.. Cheryl.. where R you??
dont like new james face. bad casting
haha that one guy has a pyramid on his head
Вой воздушной тревоги...
Apenas o melhor jogo de horror de todos os tempos.
Ummmm we getting any news or what
Remake silent hill 1 as well.
wow
Espero que não se esqueçam da dublagem em português brasileiro por favor!
“ In my restless dreams,I see that town.Silent Hill” The game I want to play for at least once in my life
fun fact, when james touches himself and his own face, he's actually trying to know if this is a dream or not
I wonder if this Remake will include the Gold Trophy 🏆 Who needs a gun, unlock the Green hyper spray.  For those of you like me who have done a 10 Star ending in order to unlock that, knows what a serious challenge that was. Doing it all again on the Remake would be amazing though. I'm up for a challenge lol
Sometimes I come to watch the trailer again to know that this saga is still alive.
no me tinca
I can’t wait to experience this game again and in hd version ❤
this feels like a fortnite cinematic.
Will there be VR support? Please tell me it will
Sorry Xbox NONE for you lol PS5 and PC ONLY haha
Can it run intel hd 5500 😂😂😂😢😢🥲😭😭😌😌
Update on official release?!? I’m seeing Friday, sept 29th but it’s not the confirmed release date.
I bitched out as a teen trying to play this.  I don't own that PS2 anymore, but I will play this and complete it.
Resident Evil 4 remake beats this so bad not even close you people dont know what horror games are
BEST HORROR GAME EVER MADE RESIDENT EVIL GET IT RIGHT
And yet here we are, almost a year passed by with no update from Konami. Countless game events come and go, even Tokyo Game Show had concluded yesterday but still there's no news about this game 😢
I am really hoping Silent hill 2 remake connects with Silent hill 3 but i guess we will see how different the remake is
Silent hill 3 has the best music Silent hill 1 harry mason Silent hill 2 nothing Silent hill 3 harry mason and Heather mason
To be honest i really didnt like Silent hill 2 because this game has nothing to do with Silent hill 3  which is my true favorite Silent hill game
Tal vez el remake eran los amigos que hicimos en el camino...
Ojalá el remake sea para todos
The original was released 22 years ago today. Will we get any news on the remake after nearly a year of no information…
WE NEED MORE UPDATES
Pure art
We need aliens
fk you konami
lütfen  çıksın  bu oyun  ps5 e
WHAT!!!! I THOUGHT THIS WAS COMING OUT LATE 2024!!! DUDOLIDATOKAY!!!!!!
oh boy... please don't ruin this Bloober Team
I'm still waiting for the second trailer... Please, Konami 😢 we need more information about this remake.  PS: Really, I can't wait to play this game, Silent Hill 2 is a survival-horror masterpiece
Por fas pley tasion saque rimeik de silent hill shater memoris 😢😢
aja y cuando van anunciar algo mas del juego o ya lo cancelaron otra vz uwu ?
waiting for the reissue of Silent Hill Origins
Is this game cancelled? I hope they didn't cancell this remake, because there is no news or updates about this project anymore.
Konami preparing a statement confirming that it's been cancelled ahead of TGS - watch this space.
Now we can see how much Kojima brought to the production and composition during the presentation of new Konami games, only in comparison you understand how much was lost... There is not a drop of intrigue in this trailer
KONAMI THANK YOU FOR BRINGING BACK MY FAVORITE SILENT HILL
9 MILLIONS! 💚
11 months of darkness i need to see the light
in my restless dreams, i see that trailer, silent hill. Konami promised us they'd show it again someday, but they never did (cancelled like P.T)... well, we're alone here now, in our special place, waiting for the remake
I know how Mary feels now. Where is this game?
It has been months and I still return to watch this over and over. Hoping we get another trailer and release date soon!
bro...the nurses😏 and then...the mod .... i can´t wait
Happy 11 months now my Silent Hill friends
Waiting for the scene to change. Was it 1 or 2 when the radio went staticky it was time to RUN
I never played Silent hill 2, but I am with hype to play it. I am anxious for this.
I will prepare a weekend with excellent ganja, monster energy drinks and a dark room for this masterpiece.
También para PS4 que están esperando!!!
James' voice doesnt sound vulnerable or weak, he sounds too gruff like every single video game male protagonist. His awkward demeanor and voice was what made the character stand out and made his conclusion make sense.
I just wished they continued P.T, that was an experience.
Pyramid head. More like, Pyramid-HOT!!! 😳😍
Triangle man, triangle man, triangle man hates particle man... They have a fight, Triangle wins, Triangle man.
Dont disappoint bloober 😁 this could be your best game or your end 👍🏻😁
Всем миром ждем ремейк
Still waiting  .____.
HYPED
Where tf is the game?!?!?!
This is a continuation of P.T.
In xbox series too??
what happened now? no hype?
time to go snorkeling!
I just want PT game back. Nothing else 👍
Shilent hill2 remake will be relesde in feburary 2024?
where is it..
1:54 this is the EXACT sound that plays in MGSV's mission sortie music lol
now say sorry to Kojima and make Silent Hills a thing. we will give you our money.
Fortunately I never play this before so it's time to hook up :D
Выпускать игру чисто для одной ps5 как по мне тупо,все равно будет для xbox и ПК рано или поздно.
No other follow up. Idk if it's being made by Team silent and it will probably won't come close to P.T. Yeah, I'm definitely having my reservation because the Silent hill franchise has been disappointing us for 10+ years now
Pyramid head baby lets go
Лучшая часть. Жаль не экранизировали, там готовый сюжет
April fools
Amazing! ❤
They better have the dog ending
I'm confuse. Did they made a Silent Hill 1 Remake already?
Rodrigo faro loiro muito top
Can't wait to play a short demo for it to then be cancelled.
Un año, un bendito año, no salio hoy en el evento de Sony, nos estamos muriendo por volver a las calles de silent hill, solo por este juego vendi mi PS4 y trabaje como burro por una PS5 y poder jugarlo en dia 1.
No silent hill game since Downpour Releases teaser for a remake Don’t make any updates Forgets game
Can’t wait to see the dog ending in 4K
I hope Bloober Team handles the Silent Hill 2 remake with care, the original SH2 is not only my favorite SH out of the entire series but it's one of the most influential horror games of all time so my fingers are crossed for them to be able to pull it off, and if they can I can't wait to play it 😀, just don't Homecoming or Downpour it Bloober Team, you can do it, I have faith in you 😀
I been waiting all this year please let my baby out now :( i really want this game to come out now its sept 14th 2023 now
Nothing can ever replace what silent hills/PT would’ve been 😢 truly would’ve been the most terrifying game to exist
Any update on this @playstation? Nothing in the State of Play…so disappointing. 😔
Tropa de brasileiros que amam Silent Hill deixa 👍
it looks a bit too cartoonish... looking forward to the final version.
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I hope Silent Hill 1 :D
Konami saw RE 4 Remake and was like "Okay that's it my turn".
This makes my old heart feel some way
release the game pls konami ☹️🙏
Where is kojima
I've never played a Silent Hill Game, but I will say, this Trailer has given me the biggest chills ever.
2002 y ahora en 2023  para pasar de nuevo por este pueblo  agradecido con el de arriba por traer el mejor título  de la historia  del terror
Sooo is this game still coming out?? Been almost a year and zero updates since then.
I like the original James face .
I am watching this regularly
TUDO O QUE PRECISAMOS É UM REMAKE DESSE JOGO
8.9 million in 10 months ima go slap my mom if dis don’t come out 😅
I mean sure, let's have James look like David Lynch, I can work with that
Silent Hill 2: Needlessly Overly Emotional James Edition
I haven't played the real one. I am Super hyped for this one. What a mesmerizing scenery ❤️
Can't wait to play this on my xbo....oh wait never mind
Ready to play it through all over again, and cry at the ending like I always do.
They want our money but they dont want to share any details about this game to fans so fair
You know, if they somehow end up throwing in a tribute to P.T. at some point throughout the game, my happiness will be...immeasurable.
LIBERAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
It's been 10 months...
Apparently it's a continuation of silent Hill one
When does it come out?
Come on do something
I can't wait for this  Is it true that it is coming put on the 29TH ON SEPTEMBER this year
Still waiting
🤩🤩
Sounds like the ps3 voice over
l LVEO Ps5😍😍❤️❤️❤️😂❤️😍
The resident evil treatment
Can we have a release date please we have all waited long enough im nearly 35 😂
After so many years I'm glad silent hill 2 is getting a remake
Contendor for video game GOAT. Can't wait for the remake.
I m someone who will always be hyped for remakes but Silent hill 2 is not meant to be played like this, i have no hype for this, they ll ruin it Just run the ps2 version through pcsx2 for the best results
Cuando los videojuegos no temían a ser "narcosatanicos" 😎
Can i share this trailer to my youtube channel????   do I have to seek permission of the game owner or just giving them credit in the description would be enough?
porque no saquen un kicnect  para playstaion
No la cagen porfa😥❤
yaaa saquen el juegoooooo
I love how they used the song “Magdalene” from the original SH2 for this trailer. Can’t wait to hear the modern renditions of the rest of the soundtrack.
DAY ONE BUY. This looks Amazing. Hope they Remake the whole Quadrilogy. 1,2,3 and The Room.   Team Bloober are DEFINITELY qualified to do it
Шут ми.
Silent Hill 2 should be Return To Silent Hills or Silent Hi11 or Silent Hills for being more than 1 Hill, ya know? Just some title ideas.
Best part of silent hill
0:35 why does that piano tune sound like Paint It Black by The Rolling Stones?
Silent hill 1 - the scariest Silent hill 2 - the most sad Silent hill 3 - the hardest to beat
Please bring to xbox
Still waiting....
They changed his jacket.
We need an update!
I hope Silent Hill 1 also Harry Mason
its a shame its exclusive for Playstation..
Leaked release date is Friday September, 29th, one month away!
I wanna get hype but I haven't seen gameplay
será ainda mais perfeito se for a mesma trilha sonora
pt
Lets goooo can´t wait
I am wondering how silent hill 3 and 4 is going to be
Why didn’t they remake Silent Hill part 1
I just realized the strange timing with the release of the original SH2.  Sepetember 25th, 2001.  Kind of strange to think about it as it was right after 9/11 that it was released to the masses.
It's nice that a lot of old PS2 games are getting a remake. Now, if we could just have a Xenosaga remake, I'd be in remake heaven.
I rewatch this trailer so i can feel something
When this game is coming out ? When ?
2:29 does anyone know what song this is?
Still waiting for Kuon remake :')
I want it in psvr2.
Please tell me that it isnt exclusive to Playstation like Until Dawn 😢
Release??!
Ish gonna be too ill. I cannot wait to go through the burned down hotel and the Historical Society!!
Please hurry up with another trailer
it better have the old voice actors
Fantastic series, but getting sick of just remakes...try something idk, original?
vou ter q comprar um ps5.merda!
When is going to be the releasing date?
Looks like getting a ps5
he looks like gordan ramsay helppp
*In my restless dreams, I still see that town...*
10 months still nothing
YASSSSS!!!! 🎉
Ma allora?????? Novità?????
wait a minute.... Three years ago? ... that disease... do he mean.... covid.... 19.... was marry and anti masker?
Cant wait for this pachinko themed game coming out.
im going to pirate this game so hard, never giving konami money ever
will it be on pc
Wow❤
PLEASE BLOOBER SAY SOMETHING
Yeah but when will it release
so, is this a remake or remaster?
It has been a full year and still no Official trailer?
Ill be playing this on PC
It's like a long, shadowy dream, or nightmare from the past being returned. I am ready.
Buena ...pero tambien esto hace ver q ya no hay cerebro para crear algo diferente ....volvemos a comprar lo mismo una y otra vez ....
New update?
We're tired... WHEN IT WILL BE RELEASED???????
WHERE IS IT AHHH
I wonder if the ps2 version will still sell for £40 + when this is out
When is the release date officially???
They are doing this but we will never see PT aka Silent Hills
about time
Not Fox Engine?
Anybody know of a release date?
When is the game coming out? No release date yet?
Okay how much longer do we have to wait???
I keep coming back to watch this. Im absolutely so hyped about this game! I cant wait to play it! And I cant wait to buy the game!!!
Question for whoever will read this comment ; did you notice that when James looks at himself in the mirror and touches his face with his right hand, he doesn't have his engagement ring on, but you can still see the mark of his ring on his finger ?
Estoy deseando que salga esperándolo desde 2002
Why not a Silent Hill 1 remake? And why looks James like an 49 year old man cause hes 29
Welcome to the 10 month mark. New trailer should be out soon-ish. . . :)
Finally, a modern Silent Hill game where having Pyramid Head makes sense... because that character should only be in a game that has James Sunderland.
Fans: Can we get P.T.?  Konami:
bruh i dont have a playstation. i really want this to get ported to pc
"In my restless dreams I see that town"  SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY !!!
Why does James have a face like he sat on a stake😂.
just wish it was even foggier. The less you see the better 😂
The trailer looks fantastic and I can't wait for more content, but I cant help to think that I'm the only one who feels like there should be a SH1 remake
His hair is 100 % matching for leons.
in my restless dreams i see that town
My thing with this is, why is it only on PlayStation? The original and HD collection was for Xbox, PC, and PlayStation. I hate when games that aren't from their respective console originally plays the divorced parents card, or the Sega and Ken Penders situation... I'm sorry sony that i cant sell my kidneys for your console, but im just gonna play HD collection on my Series S or find SH2 for my PS2.
يلااااا نبي موعد اصداررررررر
literally leon after they added it to dbd
will it release on ps4??  vai ter pra ps4??
I literally could have a child by this time and we don't have any news on the game xd
So your saying 10 years after the initial release we will get the PC port that's broken?
I wish my mom were alive to see this. We were introduced to the series together♡ Many late nights were spent with me by her side, helping her with puzzles and getting scared shitless... I didn't care about sleep or school the next day. The Town That Takes All demanded my attention... I hope this remake does justice.
I perfer the original one instead
I keep coming back to that trailer because I can't believe this game is getting a remake. Also a studio from my country is responsible for this game. Do you know if the game will be available on ps4?
what is music on 2;30
What about SH1?!!!
The return of the king
Shut up and take my money!!!1
This will be a cool game but I was hoping for a new Silent Hill not a remake. SH Probably the most macabre horror videogame history !!
We haven’t got any updates for this remake and I’m really worried, like October is almost there
I hope the sound effect when you pick up an item still remain the same!
I finished the original game about 20 minutes ago. Wow. Just wow. I can only hope this remake does it justice.
I have this video on loop so it can get more views. I'm trying to get this as the PlayStations most viewed video on the channel. Little by little. No updates on anything got me doing the most random things...
I can't wait for more news on the game. I'm so excited.
Literally Me
Silent hill sieres are iconic as f I really play silent hill origins on PS2 I will savings money to buy a ps5
James' 5 o'clock shadow looks better than most games nowadays
He does not even look like james.
Wht..i didn't see this coming.finally.
Se que en su momento ,fue el más decepcionante y lleno de Hate, pero almenos YO que tuve la oportunidad de probarlo con la HD colection ....  HDSPM!!! el team silent, me hizo llorar con la historia del 2 y logró que Header de la 3era entrega se volviera mi protagonista femenina favorita ... KONAMI!!! POR FAVOR!!! solo hazlo bien, no importa si se retrasa pero enserió pónganle aunque sea $5 de amor, por toda una generación que lo jugo,disfruto y se enamoro de esta saga!! TOMA TODO MI DINERO pero hazlo bien,porfavor.  🥺🥺🥹🥺🥺
No fixed camera no buy
Yo cool
you feel so sorry for james man
I cannot wait, my fave horror game ever...looks simply magnific
Now we need a remaster of Haunting ground.
cant wait to be released for pc digital or retail im excited 😊🎮
польский ужас
I wonder if they will have the og voice lines and same soundtrack in the remake I started playing the HD series a while back and loved both games dearly would be a shame if otherwise but I’ll probably still give this one a play for sure 🙏🏻😁
My guy Berleezy has to finish this now that it's a remake.
he looks like the guy from broken sword
9 months we're waiting...
Sad horror and hope what a great mix sh have
I hope the new generation will enjoy the game's narrative much like we did.
Mal momento para no tener play 😿
希望比re4好
Im glad to see youtube is lpving this trailer. Reddit is a cesspit pf hatred for it.
PS5, again 😭
Silent Hill 2 is one of my favorite games ever. Played it originally on my old PS2 in 2002 and immediatly realized that it was a masterpiece, even if the press reviews at that time were not so positive. Gamespot gave it a 7.7 score, what was absolutely unfair. Even if the controls sucked, both storytelling and atmosphere were way ahead of that time, not to mention the amazing soundtrack. I'm 41 years old and can't wait to play this remake on my ps5.
silent hills is better by kojima
at 1:53 the sound effect can be heard in mgsv. Not sure if its FROM mgsv, but I recognize it
I’m playing the HD remastered on Xbox sooo coool can’t wait to replay it on Ps5
please tell me there going to remake 1 again
Old fear unlocked
looks bad, just off stylistically and emotionally. these guys don’t understand what made the original pop unfortunately
Pyramid Heads skin looks too clean. Gotta make it look like he just got out of a coal mine with black soot on it or something. They have ol boy looking like he just got out of the spa 🤣
Que desesperacion, 9 meses sin ninguna noticia del juego
The Day this trailer appear I bought my ps5, waiting to return to that town silent Hill...
Posed to be acouple more months ❤
New James is always squinting and lolks constipated. I REALLY hope they fix that. Makes the mirror scene awkward and most of what he does looks off.
As someone who never played it, should I play this or the "Silent Hill 2: Enhanced Edition" for PC?
So no Norman Reedus I'm guessing?
Amazing ! however, I personally prefer the old style of dialogue or speesh. It was done on purpose to show much the characters are F ed in the head and detached from reality.
Why does Sanji look so sad now?
Protagonists should always have a set of appearance standards, for example, they should have a beautiful face, but James is not like that at all 😕
in my restless dream
sorry bloob but you cannot be serious remaking this
*Abstract Daddy has entered the chat…*
Never forget that Hideo Kojima, Guillermo Del Toro never made their masterpiece…
zzz
Legendary game😊
1:32 - Yo, such attention to detail! Look at the bottom picture, he moves the frame a little just by leaning his hand
Here we all are from our restless dreams, returning to that town. Silent Hill
Silent Hill 2 es una obra maestra, este espero que lo mejoren porque desde mi humilde punto de vista el trailer no llega a insuflar la tensión del original 🔥🖤🔥
I'm like bawling watching this, I love Silent Hill so much. I cannot wait ❤
69 box
Soon
Espero 1 ano tranquilo pra chegar no xbox!
لو قيمتها 1000 دولار شريت
2:28 was this in the original ost?
I'l be waiting this game 10 years ago , pliss bloober team make a great remake 😿😿😿😿😿
Wait this is real??
2:29 is beautiful
Why does the character model looks like the same model from silent hill down pour
Never played original yet but I can't wait to get the pre order and highest edition
20 years for a game?
if This turns out to be great when it comes out they need to make a Remake of Silent Hill 1&3 next or at least Silent Hill 1
Release it!
😻😻😻🫶💗💗💗
Quem aqui já teve o sentimento louco e vontade incontrolável de macetar a enfermeira? Eu sim!🤫🥴
I don't like how the lighting works out, in the place where James clearly turned away from the lamp, his face is still overly illuminated by the lamp, it's better to let the game just be in dark colors and not these trendy cinematic filters
Yes! Can't believe it! 🧡
What?!!!!!!
So uh, when we getting more SH2R news guys
Welcome to the 9th month mark ladies and gents, our next stop: gameplay and a release date trailer? When? Who knows...   Konami is really terrible at promoting their upcoming games, I'll give them that 👀
I'm scared for the future of this game 😢 why haven't we got anything about it in almost a year
Por fin !! ❤
Please Keep the Old Original Theme Songs
He looks like a 70 year old wearing a wig
leon's distant cousin?
Just please, don’t give it pt treatment, or worse have it come out and be extremely mid
Amigo, realmente extraño P.T :(
I think this remake looks great but one complaint I have with james is his additude like in the original its like he's in a foggy melancholy state of emotions where you can tell he's still trying to process the death of his wife while the remake seems to be going for a more panicked and sad state which could be fresh and interesting done right
We want the video to reach 12 million views
We want the video to reach 12 million views
Silent hill…
Change the appearance, buddy don’t look like he’s supposed to….
awesome
I'm sad its ps5 exclusive  the RE remakes are across platforms. I've been waiting so long for a new SH game or remake of them and I'll never be able to play it :/
Release date when?
Bad face...
We never got pt but SH2 remaster????
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why does James look like Liam neeson?
still no new trailer??
I hope they have the dog and alien easter eggs like the original
Bro it seems like William Birkin of re2
The nurse😮
wow, that looks so melodramatic in all the wrong ways... I don't want to be mean to the devs. but come on...  this looks so cheesy compared to the original.. ^^; ugh... i just can't take it seriously. not worth my coins.
we all saw the car, we all know you can find the body there 😬🚗
They need add eyes without a face slowed in the game fr
I love the PT reference at the beginning, with the cockroach on the floor... I hope that becomes konami's inside joke going forward.
the new "in my restless dreams" quote sounds like the tiktok ai voice
F3ck ps5 Dx pls Ps4 plzzzzz
epic
Que manía de poner un trailer un año antes del juego hostia.. se quitan las ganas al final
Как насчёт сделать ремейк первой части
And where is the remake of SH 1???
Okay, so... Why did they skip 1? I never played SH2, but I think SH1 is better. It started the Silent Hill fame after all. I remember when I played SH1 with my cousin, it was broad daylight but there was a part in the school when we got so creeped out that we turned it off and switch to CTR.
Give the player the option for fixed camera angles !
EXITANTEEEE 👌👌👌
I do hope they get better voice actors
!
Konami should remake Silent Hill and Metal Gear Solid.
PlayStation only? Lame. PC a year later !?
Oh man I want to play this so bad! I wonder if they’ll grace us with a PC version. (doubt it)
I hope they include the dog ending.
That they are giving us a remake of this masterpiece, is a dream come true.
I hope no blacks or transgenders
Lol this remake and the other two new SH games are all doomed to fail. Because these are *not made by Japanese company (original SH team)* .
Love the subtle hint at the pyramid head theme in the beginning
A dream come true, we really needde a remake,wish they had started with SH1 though.
Japanees SH2 with Polish spice. I would like to try. But never buy ps5 for this. Do they have plans to make it on PC?
Existen buenos juegos y sagas entrañables, pero en un peldaño más arriba y alejado de todos, está Silent Hill.
For those who haven’t played silent hill 2. I envy you so much! You guys are in for a treat!
Konami went silent after this
we’re so back
I was an Xbox kid so never played this game. Can someone who has lmk if it’s necessary to play Silent Hill 1 before playing 2? Or would it not be too big of a deal to just play 2 when the remaster comes out
Exclusive on PS5*  Xbox players: 😣😢☹️😠🥺😒
PlayStation king console of world!!!!!!!
8.4M views within 8 months. Konami, please don't f*ck this up!!🙏
and its ruined, they are 'giving up psychological horror'
I wonder how much Sony paid to have this Exclusive on the PS5.
Guys, I don’t know…
How can you sit and eat pizza at time like this??
Such a great model. Such a disaster haircut.
So was silent hills cancelled for this? Really hope they work on silent hills again. Especially if this is a huge success
We seriously need a gameplay trailer.
¿En serio han pasado 8 meses desde que lo mostraron? Que pasa rápido el tiempo.
A true game, visceral game.
as a silent hill fan, I'm excited to see this is getting redone! Silent Hill 2 was one of my favorite ones. The emotion it brought through its admittedly choppy and bad expressionism (obviously due to it was an old game and 3d anim was still new at the time) was still a very eery but nerve plucking experience. I hope that this remake will keep these features or even make them better. I'd also like to see the joke endings make it in..hehe..
September 29, 2023
I don’t know if it’s because I’m so used to the original voice acting, but the new voice acting feels off to me idk why
bruh this is the 2nd remake
Best be so pretty I become a intersection loiterer.
Xbox
Hey, didn't knew markaplier was modeling for this game, awesone 😀
I get that they’re wanting to release this around the same time as the SH2 movie but 8 months with no news is insane 😭 they should’ve released another trailer by now…
Oh if only Kojima helped with this itll be a much better experience
Happy 8 months since the teaser 👀👀👀
2:14
A Masterpiece
i dont want to play a remake  that i already finish iwant 5 or 6 :)
"In my restless dreams I see that town... Silent Hill"
This time the fog would look like fog atleast
This can't be real :O
Nostalgia zaman SD dulu, jadi ingat pas nginap di rumah almarhum kakek dan nenek dulu main silent hill sampai subuh😂
Greatest survival horror ever made, with endless possible sequels because silent hill is a dark canvas for everyone's sins.
As someone who just finished playing the original Silent Hill 2 five minutes ago, I can wholeheartedly say, This game has me more pumped than any other game this year.
Es un juego muy bueno!,el terror,suspenso, ect, todo de este juego hace que te dé mucho miedo,es una maravilla de juego,me hace recordar cuando lo jugaba de niño,me quedaba bien pegado,que buenos tiempos,y ahora Sony lo saca otra ves pero esta ves más mejor,con unos gráficos exelentes,...
i hope they release a collection like mgs
The legend came back to life
Is this game done remake by unreal engine 5
Imagine people's reaction if this was shown on live E3 conference. Sadly we can't have it since few years
Feel like the atmosphere needs to be waaaaaaay darker man
Why so cartoony vibes! The original one was trying to be realistic
А можно так же ещё сделать первую часть, вторую часть и четвертую ? И наконец-то ПЯТУЮ, бл*ТЬ ?!?!?  А ещё Cry of Fear.
Where is Akira Yamaoka - Promise?
Can it be available on PS4 ?
One of the greatest video games ever, regardless of genre
Common release this already. Im prepared with the money.
Why give nurses stockings tho...
In no more than 1 to 2 weeks i am expecting a new trailer and i have a feeling this game will come to ps4 well lets see and wait
Y!? saquenlo loco me estoy muriendo xfavor
ЕЕЕЕ
1:36 I KNOW WHAT YOU AAAAAAAAAAAARE
James!
That's true.. i thought it's a fake news to release this remake James is back
James looks amazing 😮
Men i gipe up? Or u Will gave me answers???! Please ….
Thats silent hill
Please just … geave me answers , il beg u
Is like men idont want to get out of here, i want to get Answers , i all done matters,? Or not?!!! That is silent hill
I can't wait for the worst optimization has ever made on PC. We all know why.
Literally i hope akira still on silent hill
i hope the soundtrack is still simaler
Jacksepticeye needs to play this
This looks incredible
I want to see dog ending:)
I LOVE SILENT HILL.
A reason to get a ps5 now
It's been 7 months since the release of this trailer and not even a word of Konami about the game release, I'm honestly getting worried
dunno man, i wanted guy cihi back for this remake but i guess the new voice its ok
animado para jogar. Mas o gráfico parece meia boca...
To much silent give us realise date already
I wonder if the gameplay will be changed up or if there will be a never ending amount of locked and broken doors to rattle the door handles of
Could she really be here, waiting for me?
They MUST improve the combat from the original, just tried playing it again and I rage quit...
Dajesz mi pomidora do ziemniaków? Dziękuję.
Ich hoff auf ne meisterhaft gute deutsche synchro
And no official gameplay 7 months later.....how strange this game has become so silent.
look at me konami look at me *Do. not. blow. this. for us.*
Hmmm
Konami on its way to remember one of their best franchise 20 something years laters
El unico golpe en mi es que no siento que vio al mismo james
Eyes without a face such a human waste your eyeeees without a face.
Can't wait to hear the New Theme of Laura !!!!
The best game ever made finally gets a remake, what a beautiful time to be alive
I just noticed the freshly-removed wedding ring mark on his finger at 0:46
Not sure how I feel about them making James seem so sad and nervous. His disconnected demenour really fit the whole purposeful delusion of what he did.  And makes it more impactful later when it finally faces him and he has to confront it all. It also just fit with him taking in stride all these strange things are happening.  I'll definitely give this a chance though, but I'm afraid they're trying to do a Silent Hill HD collection thing again and make it more "dramatic".
September 29th. See you soon y'all 👏👏
Akira Yamaoka please help make this series great again, you are our only hope
Can’t wait to see actual gameplay
90$ for the game??? Konami, what are thinking about?
Please and thank you!
Silent Hill Origins Silent Hill Shattered Memories = Sony PSP
Fascinating.
Can anyone tell me the name of the music when James was approaching the woman? Its so beautiful
KONAMI oh my dear KONAMI. it's been 7 restless months since you released this teaser trailer.   I need more. we all need more. grant us new trailer, or gameplay, or release date, anything!
What a damsel in the streets
Swapping my series X for a PS5 after the summer and this game is the reason why. SH2 is my all time favourite game. Goodbye Xbox.
Thanks ill infra evidence of gun person i comment about my bot aid comp will brief maximum immunity safety security
Household hackers versions too
Like weapons detectors scanners at safety distance
Buffer me also ed to avoid ip intruder
Comment filter i just saw a gun men on a bicycle op supposedly selling riffle report emergency at location im at to sheriff judges asap emergency alert i send him to the orange house with star like high school speech said
Silent Hill 2 changed my life so I think this trailer is terrible and pitiful, but I also hope that I'm wrong about what's coming and the game will prove me wrong
I dont want to be that person but I feel like Harry looks too Asian
C'mon guys, give us moar trailers! :)
Does anyone know the name of the song he sings at the moment? 2:28
I expected more from next gen graphics but... Anyway, the original will always be the king.
greenland
Is today the day we get more news about this game? Summer games
Lo hicieron en el 2012 y lo volverán a hacer: hechar a perder el título de silent hill
absolutely stunning. cannot wait to play.
😮por fin se habían demorado en seguir la saga de este maravilloso juego  me muero por jugarlo
Amazing trailer
1:53 metal gear solid V menu sound
So excited I never got to play silent hill or silent hill 2 because it came out the same year I was born. I love these games though and the soundtrack so so much I’m really excited to play it as I think it’s the most beautiful game of all time
I can finally feel the Silent Hill experience again.  This time in HD
James, Mary, Maria, Angela, Laura, Eddie & Pyramid Head❤
❤ Please come to my life.
I hope they release it on pc some day
WAITING FOR IT
Hurry up! I mean resident evil is my thing but this is an extremely close 2nd. Cannot wait!! ❤
Is gonna be playable in ps4 ??
Oh yeah more like this will be awesome ❤️
It is interesting they showed the hangman's puzzle and James looking like he's going to end it all, before he pulls the noose down to beat the puzzle.
Ufff
no la caguen por favor
I'm fu*** hyped 🎉🎉
El primero también merece un remake
Legit copy the script and code and just redo the entire graphics of the game but the same environment.
This game is going to be scary. Got dammit.
Can't wait for modders to "fix" the nurses.
it must ve been love... but its all over now
Hello, Conamy change the face of this  man into normal one
I cant understand why some people are complaining about the face?
LETS GOOO !! This is what we want !
I think they left this alone because the strong psychological aspects, but people want what they want 🤔 though seems they won't be doing a part 1
Pyramid head is suppose to have his blade scraping the ground whenever he walks.. js
did anyone notice that bloober team reutilized a sound from the blair witch game trailer for this trailer as well?
People are just not ready for this. Silent Hill 2 will prove old flames can be ignited again, even if they're dormant for 20 plus years. Giants sleep umong us, and Silent Hill 2 is one of the greatest for a reason.
Y el remake de silent hill 1?
интересно а ведь дикаприо из острова проклятых смог бы сыграть джеймса неплохо так?
A Perfeição que isso tá....tenho nem palavras. Silent Hill sempre vai ser minha franquia de jogos de terror favorita 😮❤
I can Wait!! Demo Gameplay!! 😤😤😤😍😍😍
Bring back Kojima! Konami had no business firing him. He IS the reason konami got as rich as it did.
ty
Let’s goo they kept the old sound track
MARY! WHERE THE F*CK ARE YOU!?
F*ck konami
I will always love Harry Mason ❤
Hope they make everything in comic sans
8 million views in 7 months is no joke for a 20 year old game. This better happen.
Is that James Sunderland or William Birkin? I’m confused…
Que sea exclusivo me jode mucho 💔
How are so many people hyped for this, when according to trailer itself it denies the most important virtue silent hill 2 is based on?, Anyone who knows it well, can already tell its terrible.
Chômage à vie 😂😂
Lol did they use Harrison ford?
The town Silent hill has been calling me for awhile and hopefully we get to come back.
While I'm intrigued to see how the developers remake this, I feel like a major aspect of the original SH2 was the unintentional uncanniness created due to the graphics limitations (and stilted voice acting). I'm not sure that this same sense of uncanniess can be recreated when everything in highly-optimised HD. But I keep an open mind.... let's see
This looks so cool and the graphics looks incredible! I just wish I'd have a PS5 instead of PS4, I'm currently playing the original version on PS2...
I would prefer Silent hills over this remake
I Hope Konami is selling life insurances when buying a copy off this game
You'll see more info on Silent Hill 2 Remake before the end of May!
Мда уж мы ждали когда выдет игра отменили
This game needs rx 6800 XT 😂😂😂 The end😂
I'm surpirsed it's an actual video game not a Pachinko machine.
at a moment, you can hear billy idol at the background
James kinda looks like David Lynch
it wont be for ps4 right? its my favourite game :(
YEAHHH
Any clue when it is going to be out? It’s been over a year since the release of the trailer.
I love how this almost started as a PT fake out
We want the video to reach 12 million views
Are your Maria?
The game I'm waiting the most rn
what mess you are in this time, Leon??
they took out the horror or what? it looks like it
Jeremy Irvine is very handsome and seeing his face reminds me of James Sunderland in the original Silent Hill 2. But Luke Roberts is not handsome at all and just seeing him reminds me of David Lynch or Liam Neeson 😂
is it just me or did they make him look like a young Liam Neeson.
Eddie vomit in High Def!!
It's really strange that Snake's face in Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake is very handsome and charismatic, just like the original version, even better. So why is the new face of James in Silent Hill 2 Remake so bad and has no charisma?
estranho
don’t forget they cancelled silent hills
Thought the trailer would be releasing on the new Playstation Showcase.  Guess its not. Still have to wait longer.
Who comes after the Playstation Showcase?
Not even a Teaser Trailer 2 on the Playstation Showcase, if you want to sell 10 million copies as you said you are losing the opportunity  😌
¿Silent hill PT its coming?
they really just dropped this and said bye, huh.
Look at the way James STARES at that ROPE! Do you see how SUICIDAL he is? Dear PLAYERS? Do you see how SAD James LOOKS? Oh man our storytelling is SO much BETTER than the original team. Who needs subtlety, RIGHT?
When is the new trailer coming up? Tomorrow?
Mi querido juego de terror, el mejor de todos los tiempos, cuanto te extrañé <3
the original was maybe the scariest game i have ever played.  don't think my heart could take playing thru a remastered version!
today we gonna see some new materials about this game. just rejoice my fellow gamers!
I’m completely in Bloober Team’s corner for this remake. What was essentially a polish indie studio that made mostly mediocre games (and one excellent cyberpunk horror, though,) being handed one of the most loved and discussed horror games ever?  Imagine the pressure, the nigh endless hours going over and over what could or should be changed, it makes my head spin.  The teaser itself is fantastic, and even if the remake is bad, more people knowing of the best horror game of all time is never a bad thing.
no releasae date?
could she really be here? waiting for me...
This game is not even being developed by Konami, a 3rd party Polish company is making the game.
Cant wait for this masterpiece, keep the old soundtracks
How this wont be a let down
How am I just finding out that the best horror game is getting a remake?
The gameplay is coming tomorrow, can't wait
James' face looks kinda weird to me. Like they took an asian Actor and put an caucasian filter over him.
you guys are getting really excited over a pachinko machine....
Why are the graphics and textures of the game so low? Konami, go watch the Hellblade 2 trailer to understand the true power of Unreal Engine 5. Bloober Team's specialty is not making high graphics games at all.
Do i have to play silent hill 1 to play the second part ?
Can't wait to see the Americans and their journalists start saying how this game is racist and helps white supremacy. Americans need to go away already.
maybe best horror game for 2023 😅
You NOT ready sh 30 of December you mint experiment erectil disfuntion.😅
The only thing that bothers me is how unnecesarily different James' face looks. Like even down to the bone structure, you can just see it's a completely different person. I wish they made him more similar to the original character. Otherwise 100% hyped for this.
For the old retro games like silent hill, resident evil, metal gear, castlevania, dino crisis i don't play games loong time ago haven't played any but for these kind of games i would buy and play it😂
who farded ? 2:38
Can’t wait to play it
I want the dog ending’
Remember remember the playable teaser
When they have kojima, they forgot silent hill and even kojima now what they got is low grade and low budget silent hill
This can't be real
I love how they adopted the cockroach intro from P.T.
I feel like my only issue so far is that the indoor areas look a little too... warm?
greatness
Just a few more days and we'll get more news on Silent Hill 2 Remake!
It seems that Konami and Bloober Team have a special interest in David Lynch's face 😂 How hard can it be to make a straight handsome white man? James's face is very bad.
I like how this has more views than Re 4 remake trailer. I just hope Silent Hill 2 remake turns out to be a masterpiece and dont let the purist ruin the experience.
Make James handsome. James' new face is very ridiculous and unbearable. You should make James as handsome as Leon Kennedy.
I would love to see silent hill shattered memories REMAKE please 🙏🥺
i need to know the release date!!!! ughhh why they no give release date!?
Will it still have the original soundtrack. It's really important to know
I love it!!!   Please use the music creator Akira Yamaoka from silent hill 1 and 2
I don't want to offend, but Luke Roberts has a very ugly face, I'm surprised. Luke Roberts was really handsome in the Ransom series. So why does Luke Roberts in Silent Hill 2 Remake look so ugly?
It's true that we control normal people in Silent Hill, but that doesn't mean that normal people are ugly. For example, Harry Mason and Henry Townshend were very handsome, even James was handsome in the original version. But James's face in the remake version is very bad.
I still don't understand why James is not handsome? In the original version, James had a handsome face and a more muscular body. But in the remake version, James looks very ugly and very thin.
مرت ٦ شهور 😅 ؟؟
finally a new silent hill, hope the western developers know what to do with this...if this is successful they should at least put p.t. again on the ps store...otherwise you have to buy a ps4 with it already installed and they cost too much...any hope?
i cant tell if this looks trash or amazing. praying for the best.
Im starting to get a little worried, this teaser came out 6 months ago, and there's been no news of it ever since. I really hope konami isn't pulling a PT and cancelling this game at the last minute, if that happens I'll lose all faith in konami amd never believe a word they say ever again.
A Trailer 2 would be nice considering we have waited too long... just saying ....😌
MARRY ME KONAMI
Great... But they should have started with Silent hill 1 tho
I need it right now
A Silent Hill 2 trailer without 'Theme of Laura'? Booo.
Yo Playstation Showcase next week on Wednesday!!! Maybe gameplay reveal of SH2R
Come Back "Team Silent"!
8 million views Konami, this franchise is very much alive even after over 20 years since the start and 11 years ago since the last game. So hyped for this masterpiece and for Silent Hill to return!
PlayStation Showcase drops on the 24th, expect gameplay or at the very least a release date for Silent Hill 2 Remake!!!!
Leon
is it an exclu PS5 btw ?
I love Silent Hills this is the time !
Yay I can finally play it! 🎉🎉🎉
1 Hour No Zaza 2: The Search for the Plug. Teaser Trailer
Thats the kind of horror i like cant wait for this game
Vai lançar quando?
Excelente! Agora, só mande o jogo dublado em PT BR 🇧🇷, pois com certeza vai vir um absurdo de caro e é o minimo que nós brasileiros mercemos por nossa história com este jogo.
When does the actual new version get released? I always find hints or teasers but nothing concrete of facts.
Double checked this trailer to make sure I'm still hyped.  I am 😊
So like, are we actually getting this? Or am I gonna be sad ? Lol
waiting this
Can't wait to get hands on it.On my chilling pc i9 13900k & rtx 4090
It is very strange to me that James Sunderland's face in Silent Hill 2 remake does not have the slightest resemblance to the original version, but in Return To Silent Hill, an actor was used who has the exact face of James in Silent Hill 2 original.
I like Mary's face design, I hope Maria is beautiful too. But I don't like the design of James's face at all, I think James is very old and ugly.
He’s hot now
And the best part is that it's not a pachinko machine or arcade shooter
Konami needs to learn something from CAPCOM some games need some remakes
Some games definitely need to be remake.!
Jeffy - 1:58 Cody - 2:59 Junior - 6:12 Police Andwer - 0:58 Kenny - 3:41 Tinky Winky - 1:69 Dispy - 4:65
I come back here every single week and WHAT A YEAR TO BE ALIVE !!!
This game, “Silent Hill” and the “Evil Within,”  is kind of alike!
Envoyer nous silent hill
I cant wait any longer im tired of old silent hill i want a down low view like they did for downpour
The monsters in this version change appearance depending on what you spend time looking at in the game. I heard a psychiatrist talk about the effect it has
Pls come to pc
2:13 is this the elevator scene where maria didn’t make it in time?
Silent hill : psychology horror ever. Resident evil : action shooter horror.
Wow how did that fly under the Radar. Being one of the greatest horror game of all times you'd think it would be all over gaming news sites that it is getting remade. Found it completely on accident looking up information for "evil within 3" So hyped. SH 1 and 2 was amazing.
silent hill 3 remake xbox series x|s☺
I need it on Xbox💔
Is this a playstation exclusive?
I would love to see a remake of Silent Hill 2 done well, but I'm not getting much that I enjoy from this trailer; James seems needlessly melodramatic here. After watching this I watched the E3 trailer of the original from 2001 and I'm half convinced that it really was lightning in a bottle. The voice performances, the music, the animation. James had an almost hopeful disposition, while being undermined by a persistent and mocking negativity from his situation. Anyway, I hope this remake has something worthwhile to offer, in any capacity.
Yu-Gi-Ooooooooh!!
Thank you to all people who make this remake possible this is a masterpiece of a video game from my era the 90s I will be always grateful to leave in that decade
I found Silent Hill 3 actually much scarier :/
Eight million views let's goo!
"Hello beautiful" Flirty: Remake Leon Harrasment: Remake James
he's just like me
literally me
♥️♥️♥️♥️
Instant Classic
I can't really believe that Konami is doing this after what they did to Kojima.
can't wait to play this masterpiece again, in next gen graphics, can't wait to cry in 4k
Wow look at that. 8 million views. I’m so happy this amazing franchise is once again getting the recognition it deserves 🥲
Why he look depressed asl
This feels like they dont know what the game is about   Plus it’s Konami so I wouldn’t trust this
8 Millions 💚
Hopefully, in the finished product, his jacket will actually be accurate
Where is Silent Hill One?
ببین چه گیمی برگشته  سلطان گیم ها امیدوارم مثه سایلنت هیل شاترد مموری گاد باشه
James' hairstyle does not suit his face at all. This hairstyle is more suitable for Leon Kennedy's face, but James's face shape is bony and elongated, this hairstyle is not suitable for James' face.
Now I will finally find out what happened to Leon after he retired.
8 Milllion views here we go!
“Six months and still no word, I don’t deserve it?”
I didn't know that David Lynch is the protagonist of Silent Hill 2 😂
James Sunderland was a 29-year-old with an innocent voice in the original Silent Hill 2. But in the Silent Hill 2 remake, James has turned into an ugly 80-year-old man. So justice must be done, Heather Mason must become a 60-year-old woman in Silent Hill 3 Remake. 😂
como 15 años esperando o mas con las nuevas graficas la neblina y los mostruos se deben de ver una bestialidad
Its been 6 months, we NEED more info now
Thanks 🎉🎉🎉
When does it come out?
UE4 OR 5?
where is the silent hill 1 remake?
Be very cautious.
These remakes of these amazingly built game like silent hill and Resident evil !!, so awesome
If it wasn’t for silent hills  Resident evil 7 would’ve never taken place they took their idea   I hope silent hill get back it’s throne.
James Sunderland was only 29 years old, but in the remake version, you turned him into an 60-year-old man. If one day you ever want to remake Silent Hill 4, have mercy on Henry Townshend's face and don't turn him into a 50-year-old man. Henry Townshend is a 20-year-old, no more, no less.
Luke Roberts is very old and ugly. Which idiot was really responsible for choosing Luke Roberts for James Sunderland? Jeremy Irvine's face should be used for James Sunderland.
In my restless dreams
2:01 - My prediction: Maria in Mary's form will taunt James to kill himself, so that he can be together with her in death, but he will stop trying to do that due to some circumstances.
goose bumps!!!!!
Gets cancelled lol
i miss him so much we need a new trailer
I always wished that Silent Hill would be remaked using the same engine as The Medium. My body is ready to go to Silent Hill once again
next P.T please
I expected the face of James Sunderland in Silent Hill 2 Remake to be even younger and more handsome than Leon Kennedy, but unfortunately, I encountered David Lynch's face in the trailer of Silent Hill 2 Remake 😐
still no word on a released date
James looks like a cross between Matthew Modine and Shemp
Let's look at it this way. Its been 6 months Bloober Team and Konami... No news since October. I understand they are taking their time to get this right. I just hope they can get it out this Fall and have it done right. A makeup company is collaborating with the SILENT HILL 2 REMAKE and that makeup is releasing this year. Which should mean that the Silent Hill 2 Remake is also coming out this year! Even with the PlayStation store page and Steam page both updated to "Coming Soon" from it being "TBA", I'm very hopeful we'll get news this month or next. I'm sure it'll have it's own showcase too with actual gameplay and a reveal and if it doesn't come out this Fall, then a very early January-March 2024 window! 👀👀
I was about 12 when this came out. I loved this one the most out if the series. I saw this and cried with joy. Literally tears
Jimmy, from Raising Hope?
No waaay!
I remember playing the original and crying at the ending when he is reading the letter from Mary 😢
We got to accept, konami did sh2 a remake just to keep exploiting and get money from pyramid head, though i love sh2 and it's probably one of my favourite games of all time, i have very low expectations from it, surely they will fail to recreate the real meaning and escence of silent hill :/
I was 9 when the original came out. My mom didn’t give a rats behind if I played Silent Hill or Resident Evil as long as I didn’t bother her watching soap operas. Back when we’d buy guide books to complete the game.
is this resident evil?
No Xbox, lol!
En mis sueños más inquietos, veo esa ciudad. Silent Hill. Prometiste volver a llevarme allí algún día. Pero nunca lo hiciste. Y ahora estoy aquí sola... En nuestro "lugar especial" Esperándote... Esperando que vengas a verme. Pero nunca lo haces.
this is about to be beautifuk
James Sunderland's face in Silent Hill 2 Remake is very, very ugly, his face should be changed. I think Jeremy Irvine's face should be used for James in Silent Hill 2 Remake.
I think one of the reasons why James Sunderland has become old and ugly in Silent Hill 2 Remake is that Konami and Bloober Team have a personal enmity with blond people, that's why James has become extremely ugly in Silent Hill 2 Remake.
I can't get used to James' ridiculous face. I've never seen a video game protagonist so ugly. Of course, James had a handsome and youthful face in the original Silent Hill 2, but in the remake of Silent Hill 2, James's face is disgusting.
Really, before the release of this trailer, there was no one who told the makers of the game that James's face is very ugly and that James's new face is even problematic in terms of design and is very ridiculous. If bloober team has not noticed such an important issue, bloober team employees are very stupid.
Troy Baker had a masculine and rough voice for James Sunderland in Silent Hill HD Collection. This made gamers not welcome Troy Baker's voice at all. James should have an innocent voice. But Konami was stupid again and used a very bad voice actor in Silent Hill 2 Remake. Luke Roberts has a very bad voice and a very ugly face. 2:25
Luke Roberts has a very bad voice and even has a very ugly face. Konami, why didn't you choose an almost 29-year-old voice actor and face model for James Sunderland? Why did you prefer James to become an ugly 50-year-old man? 2:15
Oh boy, if people didn't like how tough and gravelly Troy Baker sounded, they're gonna hate this guy. Sounds like every horror game's protagonist over the last five, maybe ten years. Tough, badass, manly, iron-willed. Nothing like James from SH2.
¿Y el de P.T se lo saben?
WE ARE FEARED MY DOG ENDING WILL BE CUT
U fuking kidding me 😮
Finished the RE4 remake a few weeks ago and I thought it was awesome. Can't wait to try the SH2 remake.

Is that Mary or Angela on the cover?
2:18 - James's scream
Give it to me

اقوى ريميك
Esperemos ❤
Que juegazoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
🤩🤩🤩
guess who is back (me)
Somebody go get PewDiePie right NOW
I'm so excited, I'm shaking, and spilt my coke on myself.
i'm so hyped for this game, love survival horror and silent hill 2 is a masterpiece in my opinion. i hope konami follows the same success as Capcom remaking resident evil games !!!. 😍
In my restless dreams, I see this game.
I love that they chose to play Magdalene in the trailer❤ I can’t wait to hear the rewritten soundtrack
Oh wow another remake. What a time to be alive.
Pls Bring Haunting Grounds back too
SH was never survival horror, what a stupid description.
Really happy with this so far. I just hope Konami keeps blooper team on a short leash considering their track record.
this is already a tragedy
why they made James so ugly..... why not to make a handsome man.....
Bunitu demais!
Is it me or they made James look pretty old, he is supposed to be 29.
It's been 6 months since the announcement, I reached my maximum waiting time.. RELEASE THE GAME PLEASE
I love this so much, thank you for keeping one of the best series alive! I wonder if they’ll keep the same versions of the music
this is next level🔥
....why does he look like Bilbo Baggins...?
Its not yet released here in Saudi Arabia?
Soon, everyone will see who the true goat of horror games, soon..
needs a lot of work
Silent Hill is  horror Game.
what a nerf to pyramid look
Can't wait to see... Get ready... THE DOG ENDING
Whoa
Jeremy Irvine's face is perfect for the role of James Sunderland because Jeremy Irvine has exactly the same face as James in the original SH2. But the face of Luke Roberts does not have the slightest resemblance to James, and in my opinion, Luke Roberts is very old and ugly.
James sunderland had a younger and handsomer and wider face in the original SH2, but in the SH2 remake, his face is bony and elongated and very ugly. Konami why didn't you make James handsome and young? Thus, James cannot appear in the sequels of Silent Hill because he is too old.
Esto si es una verdadera remake que locura, mi infancia en un juego 👏
I hope this also comes out on Xbox
where this epic siren!
Can wait to play this game foreal 💯🤟
why silent hill 2 not 1? did i miss the remake?
Gibt es Silent Hill Wirklich?
1:30  I just wondering, james why you look chill while some monster just show up? 😂😂😂
I really can't wait 🥹💔
They will remake for silent hill 3
The shiba inu ending better be here or else it's just not worth it
Wondering if this will ever happen. I've played the original a 100 time's.
James Sunderland was very handsome and charming in Silent Hill 2 original, especially the scene of him staring at the mirror, but in the remake version, James's face is ugly and the scene of James staring at the mirror in the remake version is a disaster.
Why is James Sunderland's face not like the original version? Why is it so different? Why is James so ugly in the remake version? In the remake games, the protagonists are always similar to the original version, but James has no resemblance to the original version.
In the world of anime, the main characters are usually very handsome, this also applies to the world of cinema and games. So why is James Sunderland's face not young and handsome like Leon Kennedy and you chose to use David Lynch's face? 😂
Game of the year.
I’ve watched this trailer about 20 times. The music, and art direction and voice acting is perfect. Exactly how I would imagine it to be, just can’t get over it
I've lost count of how many times I've seen this trailer haha, it really looks amazing to me! It's so cinematic, in a way it resembles the original in that sense, and what's more! The fog is so dense, like the protagonist's mind; the music.... Is that song at the meeting with Maria new? Simply beautifying.  On the other hand, the details of this trailer are well taken care of, some are interesting; for example, the scene at the beginning where James sees his hands reminds me of a scene in the movie Jacob's Ladder (main inspiration for Silent Hill) where they do a palm reading to its protagonist, curiously the line of destiny in James is almost missing and those of life and head are strangely blurred at the end. I don't know about palmistry, but details? By the way, have you noticed yet that James is not wearing the engagement ring but his mark is just visible?   I hope with all my heart that the team pulls it off and that the game does well, because if it does, who knows, maybe we'll see remakes of the main installments in the future.
Remove this hairstyle for God's sake, it looks like a cliche on him, then she's in Resident 4, now here.((looks like he's a 50-year-old imitating a 15-year-old buzzer.
All the locked doors, we meet again!
its been a while since this announcement, any update on whats going on with the game?
FE
This is great
Finally
Remake Silent Hill 1
next : SILENT HILL 4  PLEASE !!
Between this and RE4... magnificent
Change the ridiculous and ugly face of James Sunderland and make him young and handsome.
Konami, why did you really think that young gamers like an old, ugly and cowardly protagonist? In the trailer, James is portrayed as an unconfident and miserable person. Go see the RE4R trailer and understand how impressive Leon Kennedy is.
James Sunderland's face in Silent Hill 2 remake is very bad and has no charm or charisma. I think James's face was much more handsome in the original version, but in the remake version, I think James is very old and ugly.
The PS5 has one game now
I thought Konami makes only sport games
When Silent Hill 1 remake?
“Masterpiece” isn’t even the right word
THANKS,
As excited as I am for this game I wonder why silent hill 1 remake got skipped is there a reason?
"This game is gonna be great!" Have you played any of Bloober Team's other games? "No-" There you go. Now shut up!
I would like James' jacket to have the patches of the original but other than that I like James' new model, he looks like someone psychologically destroyed.
this is the reason i bought ps5
4K PYRAMID HEAD.
It lacks realism...
Please for ps4 🙏🏻 please
I wanted resident evil 4 remake to be foggy like this game.😢
الرعب النفسي في هذا الجزء خطيير ويعتمد بشكل كبير على الموسيقى ،الموسيقى تلعب بنفسيتك +اللحسات الي تصير والالغاز .لعبة متكاملة ،انصح الجميع يلعبون الكلاسيكية ،مع انها نازلة من سنين لكن خرافية
I'm sure it'll be released this Fall with more news in the next couple of months. Bloober Team and KONAMI have been working on the remake for 4 years now behind closed doors. Maybe a new trailer and gameplay at the PlayStation Showcase in late May?!
I really hope it’ll be for Xbox too.
The best franchise ever 😍
Re watching this trailer after finishing the original game makes a lot more sense now!!
There was a HOLE here. It's gone now.
What if they did the ultimate troll and it was pachinko like MGS3
release when ?
So exicted for this, can`t wait to play it....
Ok but when will we get the full release of P.T?
Yooooooo!
Xboxers: 😭😭my redfall is much better
"many old games are remake because old games are really fun to play" -Abdul M Gaming
AGHHHHH!! When is this game coming out!!??
When is release? It’s 2023 now
YES!! Yes please!!
Buena el juego silent evil  remske
Konami’s another master piece 🎉
Is weird how they remade 2 instead of 1 though...
I got a letter….. The name on the letter said Silent hill 2 remake……
O jogo é bom porém precisamos de uma continuação na história e não mais um ramake.
The best horror game ever.
it doesn't even feel like SH game based on this trailer, true fans should skip this one and leave the leftovers for the millenials to choke on, they gobble pretty much everything they're served anyway
I see some silly complaints, but.... am I the only one who is not sure about the art style? For me this looks cartoonish at some points... idk I'm not a fan of how it looks yet....
Я ЗАПРЕЩАЮ ПЕРЕДЕЛЫВАТЬ ЭТУ ИГРУ
love this video game it's something incredible and exciting it's worth your attention
No me jodas!!! Siiiiiuu 👍🏻👍🏻
anyone else not impressed with these graphics? Its 2023 and consoles still cant compete anywhere close to cpu 🥱🥱
the game was great, i can replay it anytime if i wish. What is the purpose of remaking?? besides getting more money from it
great experience for yall who never played the original SH 2 and know nothing about it. you're in for a helluva ride.
Will they keep the old soundtrack? I hope they do.
Anyone that doesn't think this looks awesome is wearing nostalgia goggles, new doesnt mean bad, its not the 90's anymore,  everyone talking about the original like they chose it to look like that, it was technical limitation not an on purpose style. Redo the original music, keep the dialogue, and the slow combat and we got a game of the year contender. I'm so tire of my generations doomerism point of veiw   Its OK to see things from a different point of view.  You depressing freaks.
Everyone's complaining already, I'll never understand. I can't play any of the games because i don't own a PS1-3 anymore. Im so happy this franchise making a comeback. Some SH fans are toxic af
there is one more reason to buy ps5😂
@beastboyshub
boring
Abstract daddy bouta be wild
Only for PS5?😢
i come back to this video everyday to see my baby girl🥰🩷
PYRAMID HEAD!!!
Can't wait to see how many cut in this game
que horribles graficos tienen las cafeteras
However, the sad part is that the gaming companies are trying to milk old titles, they've really run out of ideas. Mostly all are relying on remakes of old games that were hot back then.
I hope they release it for PC too. It's been ages since I played Silent 1, 2, 3 and 4 - The Room. Great times.
Come on, when’s this out? I need to find Mary! Also, we need a remake of the original Silent Hill plz lads
Can't wait
I liked this game since from ps1 console
the best psychological horror game franchise that ever exist
Yes.. yes yes yes it's finally time to buy a playstation
Im glad the new generation of gamers (me) can experience such a masterpiece.
Me, seeing pyramid head   ITS BEEN A LONG TIME MA BOY
why not silent hill 1?much better
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙆‍♂🤩
Yet Konami couldn't do silent hills
that fog...
Ps4? 😢😭
What is the game about?
Come onnnn show us something please a release date or smn 😢
Главный герой должен быть похож на Лиона Кеннеди,а не на старика из Алон Ин зэ Д’Арк …
Its not Kojima tho, could of been better if it was.
bruh, i hope i got a ps5
Guys y’all are forgetting something.  This is konami  They’re going to fumble it
I still will never forget nor forgive what happened to Silent Hills. Its the one game cancelation I can't seem to get over
Seriously… I can’t wait for this game, I watch this trailer every week
I'm so hyped for the remake, loved the original. Probably be one of my game of the year, hopefully it will come out soon sometime in 2023.
Im very excited but bummed out that it's a playstation temporary exclusive
Quando será lançado?
Silent Hill 2 Gameplay demo
Hopefully this is the start of Konamis comeback
Stares at trunk of car
What the beautiful music from 2:30-2:38?

I'm literally so excited!! yippee
The silence is over. 😂
THE SILENT IS A BROKEN
obrigado konami <3
I can't wait. This game is the one I'm most hyped for. I really hope it does well. Maybe in the future we could get 1 and 3 remade too. Yeeeee words cannot describe my excitement for Silent hill 2 😃
Please Bloober Team release this soon I'm too excited, it will be the game of the year for me.❤
Czekam na metal gear solid. To jest slabe. Jedynka przebija
One of the best soundtracks of all time.
I can't believe it! The reason to buy PS5 and get bankrupt
IM IN LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE

big hopes pls don't ruin it
no update
I can’t wait till this comes out I loved the original sh2
2:29
Looks awesome and one of my favourite games of all time
More like "Finding Mary" Again
I am probably going to sound absolutely stupid to Silent Hill fans. But, iv never played an actual Silent Hill game. But fell in love with watching people on YouTube playing PT. And, I was devastated when I learnt it was never going to be. Is this going to resemble PT at all, does anyone know ? 😮 x
Ah come on Silent Hill 2? Not Silent Hill 1 or 3???? Oh well it's better than nothing.
متى تنزل بسسسسس
Never thought they'd make a remake. Mind blown.
WE MISS PT SILLENT HILL
2:42 when would this scene take place?
seriously can’t wait
Finally I don't have to pay 1000 for an original copy of silent hill 2 to enjoy the game all over again
I will never forgive Konami for denying us Kojima's Silent Hills.
I hope they use the same soundtrack.
eh
OOF I honestly wanted a silent hill 3 remake instead idk if that would be an unpopular opinion.
Silent hill and resident evil are my favourite games ever ❤️👍🏻
in my restless dreams... I see Bloober Team disaster
My dream is becoming true...
0:39 Arthur Morgan is that you???
hopefully the gameplay is like resident evil 2 remake and not resident evil 1 remake
Why a PS only 😢
Use the original soundtrack PLEASE. NO REMAKE
I see they are taking full advantage of kojimas fox engine.
We now need dino crisis ❤
я не хочу видеть  это г""вно под именем silent hill 2 . если делать, то делать нормально, либо НЕ делать вообще.
Oh boy, this is gonna be traumatic!!!
Did they remake the OG silent hill?
Will this be the unreleased pt ?
why is not a single person on earth talking about this. WHY AM I JUST NOW FINDING OUT ABOUT THIS!?!?
Let’s GO!!!!!!!!! Let’s GOOOOO!!!!!
I need it
When
❤
I watched this trailer too many times...
الاعظم
Is this the new Pachinko machine?
2:47 O.O!!!
Konami you are pathetic
Most horror game ever
I need this game now, not knowing when its coming is just torture :/
Make a remake tooo
those who know whats on the other side of those scenes know, for those who dont, be prepared.
Looking forward to seeing the HD remake of the UFO ending
This time Silent Hill 2 Remake will have a Japanese version with Japanese dub
In my restless dreams, I see that town...
PlayStation only, as it should be.
Any news on the release date?
bring this to xbox :/
Never have I ever thought i'd see a silent hill and pine cone head.
i need this as a movie, the creepiness always get me
Looks gud
These graphics will make my 2060 blow up lol
When is the release date of this game??
Strange, how no modern engine can recreate what it felt like to play silent hill or re2 back then. The technical shortcomings Made the games more terrifying, it wasnt so realistic and a lot, even when shown, was left to Imagination. Like alien, if it Was done today it would have 10 min of effects alien, and would be much more mundane.
we just need another trailer :(
Creo que es la quinta vez que lo veo el tráiler...en este mes
Yes this Game is a absolute Masterpiece 👀
So we'll see pyramid head going down on it in 4k...
Mano esse jogo vai ser foda pra caralho,to esperando ansiosamente junto com re4 remake
looks quite melodramatic
Gosh, I want this game to come out already.
Akira showed us what TRUE atmospheric horror is with music. He's a composing genius 💛
so dramatic
Can’t wait for Angela 😢
bro think he Capcom 💀
Just remember Konami was the company who cancelled silent hills , out sourced there IP to studios who made terrible games also a dungeon crawler on the psp . They also made an awful HD remake and not released the originals . Plus this is the third time Konami will be selling silent hill 2 to you , how can anyone be blinded so badly by the awful Konami
Silent Hill will always have a special place to my heart these games always make my skin crawl so I'm excited to see what this Remake of the second game brings!
Next remake manhunt😌
So creepy as silent hill we known.. But the pyramide head not like before.. ☺☺
what is Leon doing in Silent Hill?
2:38 to 2:40 man I love this part cuz the momento he realize that supposed to be his wife, the tittle come out with this blur noise effect. It's like James doesn't now yet what we already know.
Game looks fantastic
Please make a Dino Crisis Remake
My boy pyramid head looks amazing 👏 ❤
I believe it once it comes out
Enfin!!! Enfin!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
One of the greatest horror games ever made. I'm stoked for this.
You just simply cannot beat PlayStation. Fact.
It's time to go back, guys.
pachinko or quick action buttom mashing ?
Bloober team has a monumental task ahead of them, remaking the single greatest horror videogame of all time. I admit I'm skeptical, I think recapturing the horror and atmosphere of the original is next to impossible.  But if they do it, if they actually do it...
サイレントヒルシリーズで２が一番好き。 凄く楽しみ！！！
Thanks for kidnapping it Sony, even if I have to wait a year it doesn't matter, as long as I don't buy a PS5
Nostalgia...
jisisodjdnfl
bring back P.T!!
They gonna eff this up somehow I feel it
Amazing!!!
I can't wait to see silent hill 2 on the unreal engine 5 it's shocking thinking it's been so long when this game came out in 2001 now it's 2023, and the graphics are just amazing 👏 this proves old games from ps2 can be remade on the next generation
Contra remake needed
2:05 i I remember correct, this is the puzzle at the abandoned prison courtyard - where you need to find a tablet
Of course it’s a ps5 exclusive had to ruin it for everyone
Can't wait for this 🔥
Gonna need a something more than some guy randomly walking around.
Hope the rowboat part is even creepier in this remake along with that hotel across Toluca Lake
They better not cancel it like they did for P.T.
creators running out of ideas so just remake classics to cash in.
So when it's gonna be?!!!!! Date plz
Man, I don't know what Konami thinks. It's only been four months since the only show for this game has reached 7.3 million so far, and they only promoted one show and one tweet on their Twitter account before that. Do they not know how popular the series is?  Or do they not have money to develop or revive this series again? Frankly, I thank Capcom for what it is doing at the present time in terms of parts and remakes of the Resident series. I think it made Konami finally wake up, but I hope that they do not waste this overwhelming golden opportunity for this series.
I thought I'd get my grandkids to play it for me
Looks super boring. No hates
No thanks.
I can't wait for this game.
if only it was on ps4 -_-
Is this a remake? Remaster?
There better be that og music... It was terrific
Yo can we at least get the season this is dropping Sony?
James.....
Poxa, coloca uma legenda em PT-BR no Silent Hill 2 Remake 😭
PLEASE MAKE THIS GREAT KONAMI WE LOVE YOU AND THIS SERIES!!!!
Great. Looking forward to play this remake.
Silent Hill done, Castlevania Lords of Shadow next
I am SO hyped for this for real! Absolutely adore the original, and I'm super excited to see it all come back to life once again.
letsgoooooo
So about sonys company infighting. Where did the japan studios go? And Did The Psvita Not recieve Enough Resources from Playstation Because American People took control of sony entertainment? japan and american people always fighting for righs so if this is really the case than sony entertainment america is really a bunch of Devils.
Silent Hill's best components were the music, atmosphere and how the horror actually meant something personal. Hopefully they can recapture that
Looks insane...and I've just started a 'Let's Play' playthrough video  on the old PS2 version lol
Hi
2:31 song of the ost please?
They keep crying xbox can't have it all but this will be an exclusive: 🤡
So they are releasing two games? "f" and SH2?
Konami : we can't let Capcom getting all the attention for their Resident Evil Remakes
Silent hill 2 is my teenhood..that and the resident evils and gta..my teenhood gameafied...im thrilled to see silent hill getting a remake..just thrilled!!
Amazing how James has the ring mark on his finger
Note that there rumor that the original team for silent hills is not working on this so you better keep your expectation lows since blooper working on this and from what I heard their previous work is quite controversial
Unreal engine 5 + silent hill baby ❤
Socio trabajar muy duro
❤
They made a metal gear game without kojima and nobody liked it. They are making a silent hill game with bloober team and not Team Silent.
Needs more fog
Ngak kreatif, game remake melulu , bikin yang lainlah.
I Gotta say The old voices really Grew on me over all These years
Ist das ein Remake??
F*ck Konami
Ito and Yamaoka are ballers still working on Silent Hill 20 years later
Im still here, waiting, waiting to see that town again, silent hill, thank you konami for realive the flame in out hearts for you
I have a feeling this is gonna be a miss
What's the big deal with Silent Hill? I don't understand the hype.
I still don't understand why James is so old and ugly? At least if you're going to remake Silent Hill 4, don't make Henry Townshend an 80-year-old, he's a 20-year-old
Hurry up and release already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
are you Allan Wake ?
Impressionante! 😯 Espero poder jogar em VR para ser mais desafiante!
studio is making money again and this will made konami rich 👀
James new face is so ugly
Are we gonna meet High res Shiba in this game??
I hope it doesnt get cancelled like the last attempt, I also would like to have a remake of all silent hills up until the 4, the real ones not the crappy ones that came after
in Xbox to?? :’)
Por que mejor no sacaron el silent hill 1 !!!!!!
In my restless dreams, I see that ending in 8k.
About 15 million views.
Why james sunderland not handsome just like Leon Kennedy our Alan wake? 🫠
I Hope this game will have better bossfights and more monsters or at least some new versions of them
No Bollywood no Hollywood only ps5 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thought I was not getting ps5, at all. But I will
where the dog ending in 8 k
Y only on ps5 not xbox
Looks promising, and I say that as someone who ranks this game in their top 5 of all time. James looks too sad though, he needs to look more withdrawn.
they should have made silent hill 1 1999 remake, not this one
Its crazy how most gamers today weren’t even around when this game was released.  The majority of modern gamers in their teens today haven’t played the originals the remakes are based on. If you didnt feel old enough already lol
feels like having ice cream and decide to make an HD frozen yogurt version of it
ready to fire up my steam and play this
Unreal Engine? Why not Fox Engine?
0 atmosphere here , I'm really worried about how this game will pan out it feels wrong
I played the original series 1-4 ,Glad to see remake is happening ❤️
Can't wait bro
Resident Evil 4 Remake and THIS.... WHAT A MOMENTO TO BE ALIVE
why doesn't James look like his older version from SH 2? I loved Ken Doll look more
Pura nostalgia esse jogo. Ansioso pra jogar de novo
Honestly I think one of these were enough. The story’s not very interesting like the character himself😑. And he’s bad around kids. Sh4 is kinda better and Henry’s a bit cooler.
what is it about this game that they keep recreating.... isnt this the third time just uncancel silent hills
Como que no saben contar o ya salio el remake del primer silent hill
Konami still make games? this is a shock.
This is system seller for me
Sadly the more realistic than make it the less scary it is. If they wanted to recapture this they should have done it in the graphics of PS1 PS2 Era. That's what made the game the type of graphics and the music that went with it.
O brabo tem nome
When Developer learning it. Horror games with modern graphic not work
Much as I want to love this remake, it feels too clean and sterile compared to the original version.  Pyramid Head has been stripped of his blood which is one of the reasons he was so terrifying to start with, you knew he could kill you in a blink of an eye. I hope they keep the endings with the Shiba Inu and the aliens.
“ i realize now why i needed you but it’s all over now.”
Still isn’t enough… we need Silent HillS!
It's not too late, change James' face before it's too late. Also his new voice actor. You should use Jeremy Irvine for voice acting and James Sunderland's face model
Jeremy Irvine is the best option for James Sunderland, it's not too late, Jeremy Irvine should replace Luke Roberts. James's face is so ugly, Jeremy Irwin's face should be used
PT full game when?
I wasn't thinking about PS5 until the Re4 and SH2 remakes
2024?
Unfortunately, the only reason this exists is because Konami wants a game to promote the Silent Hill 2 movie.
2:24 my baby girl
я ради этого куплю себе пс5
Why is James sunderland not young and handsome like Nathan Drake or Alan Wake?
Before watching the trailer of Silent Hill 2 Remake, I thought that James Sunderland was going to have a handsome and attractive face, but unfortunately, I faced an ugly 80-year-old old man 😕
There is no PS4 version??? cry~
Goat
Idk I feel like the old Silent Hill games were a lot more scary then this one
Now do Shattered Memories Konami and I will be satisfied and relieved.
Don't mess this up, Bloober. This is my favorite THING of all time. Not game, my favorite THING. EVER.
might have to buy ps5 for this one
de lo que nos perdemos los pobres :,)
sure hope konami give this treatment to all of the older silent hill games
Dumbest trailer I’ve ever seen in my life
butchered his face tho, that don't look like my baby girl james
Say hello to the ugliest protagonist in the history of video games, James Sunderland 😂 Why did James become an ugly 80-year-old old man? ☹️
Before watching the trailer, I expected James to have a beautiful face like Leon Kennedy, that is, attractive, handsome and young, but after watching the trailer, I'm sick of James' old and ugly face 🤢🤮
Why is James so old and ugly? 🤨
It didn't need a remake. It needed a proper HD port.
7.1 million in 4 minutes
I can't wait!
урааааа
Ppp
Pp
Simplemente hermoso
Give me this now
vaya pasada
Man keep these old classics coming in remakes and remastered
We want 1
Did they forget about Silent Hill 1 ...Jumping the shark
Can't I buy it on ps4?
Graficas de ps3
wow looks like Konami gave up Pachinko Machine and went to back to its root.   I guess after all those RE2, 3, 4 Remakes they wanna have a slice of the cake and remaking their most successful Horror Game S2.  I feel disappointed James voice and look is too much altered.
Какой скучный трейлер
🔥Konami🔥
Massive nope for me. Too scary
Espero que también hagan el remake de SILENT HILL 3 pero con los sonidos originales pero en HD
Oh yeah i'm member silent hill ps2
Glorious idea for a remake but wow that pyramid head looks, bland? Washed out. I guess we'll see. Can always update it. Great stuff.
I cant wait to see the dog ending
Take my money now!!!
Id would like to see some details that would show more how it was for James to live with his ill wife for 3 years.
They jumping straight to 2?
PS5 🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞🤞
It took me 3 days to get through the intro into silent hill 2 on playstation 2. It scared me to sleep. But it also brought me back to the same fear that made me turn away.  The game invited me into my fears. The game invited me into life. A great game. The power of Silent Hill.
이런건 vr로 나와야제ㅋㅋㅋ
SH2 definitely deserves a remake, this brought tears to my eyes
Silent hill coming back ? :0
Is the Dialogue still gonna be awkward?
Creamy boxers right now
So no ps4 release????Start making PS five $5 million and we could afford them
Why the fog still looks better on PS2 version then any other till this day.
All these remakes, while deleting Days Gone II, what a waste.
el verdadero me  vengooooo xd
Jan... kl doyan PS5 bikin candu.  Grafisnya menggugah syahwat.
At 2:44 what kind of character is that cone shaped ?
Que ganas de volver a ver a Sebastián Castellanos
7 mil 🎉
Can’t wait to play it in 2025 😢 on my Xbox
Leon brother
James has not aged, in fact he has become ugly 🙂 But he was handsome in the original version, but now he is very ugly in the remake version 😒
The new face of alan wake in aw2 is handsome and a masterpiece. One enjoys seeing the face of alan wake or Leon Kennedy because they are very handsome, but the new face of James Sunderland is shocking. James has become very ugly.
Why james sunderland not handsome just like Leon Kennedy our Alan wake
Luke Roberts is very ugly
🧨
Holy shitburger! They are remaking it! Silent 1-3 are the best Silent Hill's and hope to see 1 and 3 remade like this.
Ps6
Vamos trabajar juntos
I never saw the day, is this real life 😂
Horror fans are going on a FEAST
Only available on PS5??? No PSP version? For this new silent hill😔😟🫂
Well....Guess I'm buying a PlayStation 5.
Должно быть круто!
Ja ja ja❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
SONYもこう言うCM流すんだったらもっとps5の生産台数を上げてそっちに力を入れて欲しい。一部のユーザーだけではなく一般ユーザーにも買えるように。
Best silent hill is from psp
ｐっぽおい
I don't think I can do this again now is looking to real ... lol
Does not have the feel of Silent Hill.  I truly hope I’m wrong
@Konami are You alive :o?!
Playstation 2. Still rocks
cool
No wayyyyyy
A 3 minute trailer isn't a teaser, it's a trailer.
Было бы супер если всех 5-и частей бы сделали ремейк начиная с оригинал сюжетность идет последовательная
pengguna PS 4 sangat sedih melihat ini 🥺🥺
I hope they don't fire Akira Yamaoka and make a silent hill survive or some pachinkos
I loved the series so much! Can´t wait :D

"You can't just kill somebody for the way they look at you"
If Konami forces Bloober Team to prevent the game's progression at any point by using paywalls of any kind, I swear to everything that is sacred on this sad excuse of an earth that I will send several pipe bombs via Fedex to 1-11-1, Ginza, Chuo-Ku, Tokyo, 104-0061 Japan every mounth, same day delivery, for the rest of my life. The only things that should prevent progression in a survival horror are puzzles and riddles.
About time, all I can say, about, time.🙏

They perfectly recaptured James' miserable face

Jugué a muchos silent hill y no hay otro juego que sea mejor,hace tiempo que llevo esperando esto
The sequence to a beautiful game from the straight era before minecraft and tiktok. Refreshing.
@MikeShowSha devi giocare questo gioco
what about METAL GEAR SOLID
Классно передали лицевую мимику протагониста.
Welcome to Afterworld
Помню фильм
Silent Hill 2 WooW
Is it only going to be on Ps5 tho?
Release date?  also, only for PS5? no PS4?
그래픽말고 겜성이 발전하먼안되냐
Anyone else get the urge to  Watch Jacob's ladder? 😱😱😱
ウッチャンに見える
7,8k dislikes? why
Whoa this looks awesome man
I really want this game to be as faithful as the original and I hope that this will make KONAMI to comeback in the video-game industry with their many other precious IPs like Metar Gear Solid, Castlevania, Suikoden, Contra etc.
and where is Eddie Dombrowski...???
ХАРАТЬЯН УЖЕ НЕ ТОТ
I think it’s time to buy a Ps5.
2023 Konami putting their hands on one of their classics sounds kinda scary, lets just hope for best
Shame there wont be an xbox version 😡
第一集有沒有重製
I feel like it’s too clean they need to add some grain but still hyped for this
Nem chorei 🥲
In my restless dreams I see that town.
I sincerely hope this game gets released well before the nukes start flying.
Now do the same with Castlevania Konami
Call me optimistic, but when they brought SH2 and 3 for Ps3 back in the day and freshed up the graphics and changed the voices, it didn't go very at all.
WOUAW
No seais malas personas y sacarlo para la ps4
Ok, I recently got my PS5 at last, so I can play this masterpiece, now I just have to stay alive until this releases.   Seems easy enough.
Happy for choosing PS5
Very nice 👌 👍 👏 😀
I wish they would make a SH2 spin-off played from the perspective of Angela, also re-enacting her couple of times with James, again from her perspective.
Plz more details about silent hills games
BRING BACK P.T !!!
Hands down, the best horror video game in gaming history.
"I'm here for you, James... See, I'm real..."
Sharonnnnnnn
,,,
NO PC ! 🤬😡
Let's gooooo
What i hate about myself is that i would always create movie ideas in my head. Silent Hill is one of them. I told my whole family about my Silent Hill version...they loved it so much. I asked, "out of all the movie ideas i made, which one do you love the most?" They responded Silent Hill. They loved how gruesome i mase it and all the correctness i put into it.
when is release for PC ?!
it was around 2000. one of the best games ever for that era. By the way, I realized that triangle heads actually wearing something :) Thanks Konami!
I haven't played silent Hill can someone explain it to me simply
In an alternate universe we’re getting Silent Hills 2 instead of Death Stranding 2 right now. The comments about Konami forgetting Silent Hill are funny, but I mean the last entry was only what, like 9 years ago. You put out a bunch of mid games for an IP and of course it will get shelved for a bit. Hopefully this is a return to form. This truly is the gen of the remake, and I don’t know how I feel about it.
Ugh, I hope it isn't a PS5 exclusive. Hopefully it comes to PC as well.
All i have to say regarding the remake is konami and bloober have ONE chance to get this right
I really hope they keep the fixed camera
Where's Silent Hill 1?
gives me so many memory’s
no child needs to play this just us grown ups who lived through the times of when horror games were a thing
bruh to be honest this look nothing like sh2
I don't care what anyone says.
Nice to see this one is coming back. 😀  Have a great day everyone!!
宇宙人👽のエンディングと犬🐕のエンディングが早く見たいです✌🏻😊✌🏻
Plz remake silent hill 1
Konami knew that P.T is such an amazing HOROR game that ever release and they also knew that they could not beat it! So the give the game a rest time for fans to gather and they release 4 game just to beat a trailer (P.T). But, speaking for Silent Hill fan, any Silent Hill game are most welcome!
YES.
Legacy of kain is coming too, even the company made a poll asking to the fans, on how we want the legacy of kain saga to return, if remaster, reboot, a sequel or a remake
I still say they should have brought back Guy Cihi, especially when they're already making James older.
Oh maria......... 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍.
they should do a tv show. and i feel like james bean would be perfect though mayb as lil old
Probably one the most Underrated horror game franchises in today's terms, not to mentions it's complicated origins but man is it not refreshing seeing this remake coming to fruition!
...I think I just peed a little 🤣 Akira, make us proud!! I listen to that soundtrack so often and any beautiful remixes. I'm gonna cry when I get to play this.
jombieeeeeee
Why not in ps4
Rip silent hills
Never thought I’d see the day that Konami remembered Silent Hill
WELCOME TO SILLENT HILL AGAIN.
Were gonna get Resident Evil 4 and This!!
How did I not hear about this for three months? This looks great!
Hopefully we get the same treatment for 1, 3, and 4 in the future
<3
Look like this game is completely overshadow by silent hill F
so no norman reedus in this series?
La mejor noticia del 2022
All of Blooper teams games are copies of themselves. Claustrophobic walking simulators with almost zero gameplay.   Have no faith in this remake. Just another nostalgic cash grab probably.
I can 't stop watching this trailer!!!!
I hate to be that guy but this trailer makes me nervous - slight changes can have a huge effect on things. For example the way James runs into the bathroom and his hands are shaking - it’s only a small change but I think changes the tone of the intro entirely.   I hope that it’s not like this for the rest of the game and that the original vision isn maintained. I’ve long held that the strange stiffness in graphics and movement of characters only helped further the uncanny feeling and that’s lost here.
Does someone knows the names of the songs troughout the trailer?
CAPCOM.tendremos el mejor juego para el 2023 resident evil 4 remake NOSOTROS.van a revivir al mejor clasico silent hill 2
there is no silent hill on PS4 very disappointed
Pyramid head lookin clean af
This looks spooky 🦇 🦇 dope 🔥 even though never played silent hill series probably played one of the silent hill games at my older cousins house when i was a child
Música,  más gameplay, .más historia  toda una obra maestra
Psvr2 support please?
Great graphics for a pachinko game :D
Isnt this what was being teased with PT before it got canceled?
Has there been a silent hill 1 remake and when is this out
Sorry but I still prefer the original Silent Hill 2 over this remake.  Why couldn’t they just have made a new one instead?  It’s been over a decade since Downpour.
Bisher war ich der Meinung dass ich keine Ps5 brauche. Aber wenn ein Remake von Silent Hill 2 rauskommt, da bin ich sofort dabei.
Wow that’s a lot of work they put it just to make a trailer for their upcoming silent hill 2 pachinko machine. I guess that’s what they’ll be showing on the screen as you play it.
I am super excited for this to see how the characters look and what might change but none the less I hope this does really well I really enjoy the original.
Graphics are going to look incredible, can't wait for this one!
In my restless dreams, I see that dude, Dombrowski. He promised he would save me some pizza, But he never did.
👏
why does silent hill 1 doesnt have a remake?
RemakeStation5
I thought I would never see the remake of this masterpiece in my lifetime. I am happy I was wrong.
why does main dude look like edward norton🌜
at 0:34 is that Promise from the original movie?
Cannot wait!!!!
Its gonna be bad. The james actor seems much more of an introverted older guy than the original, he's supposed to like a regular guy, and due to his mental state during the game he acts hollow relative to what finds in the town, near the end we see more emotional and realistic performances because his mind becomes clear.
cant wait to see pyramid head abusing that manequin (i think i spelt that wrong)
no original VAs 😢
Is this actually coming to the PS5? I can't find any details of it.
Edward Norton?
What's that piano song in the end when he says "Mary?..."
He looks like a 50 year old Leon Kennedy...
If you guys dont release for PS4 not going to buy... Because I Dont have a ps5 😅
I just realized this isn’t cgi it’s unreal engine
9/10 never forget
I can't wait to try it 😫
I need a ps5 ..........
Me expecting to see Lisa Garland:
Based on the haircut alone I won't be buying this game
Best horror game ❤•
Please be open world please be open world
Who’s playing James in silent hill 2 remake?
why are they doing this with 2? the og is still stuck on the Playstation
Hate to be that person, it's one of my favourite games....though I wonder how they will ruin it?  Please don't ruin it!
Ufff ya Quieor ver a la heather con las gráficas de esta generación 😅
will this be on steam?
lool sued xbox for activision now u do the same? cool
By the looks of it, I can assure you guys that using anti depression and anxiety pills will be necessary before playing this traumatizing game
Aaand the trailer missed the total point of SH2.
Is this pt?
I finally,  FINALLY have a reason to buy a PS5!!!!!
I hope this is what the final graphics will look like and I hope they’re using that sweet sweet fox engine
NOW RELEASE SILLENT HILLS PT PLEASE
Had this for the PS2, still the scariest game I've ever played!
I had to pause at 30 seconds in to say WOW at the graphics! I hope the gameplay will be just as remarkable!
PSVR2 is right around the corner,  just saying.....
why wont it be available on ps4?😭😭
Mary ?
I like trailers that show gameplay.
Please have Capo, remake Haunting Ground and Rule of Rose
Cool
Not quite the vibes
My dad used to eat the same food every day
10 ⭐️ this game
We need the new silent hill with Norman reedus 😭 P.T?
I hope we get an option for tank controls and fixed camera angles with the addition of an over the shoulder camera
Estará para pc también?
Silent hill, the silent hill 2 is real
i've watched this teaser hundred times now
Or or or silent hills
Looked everywhere. It feels like a GAME in itself just trying to make my phone tell me   WHEN THIS GAME IS FCKING RELEASED!!!?????  I just saw fcking SASHA GREY playing it on her channel !!!  When is it out!!?? 😭
Yes at long last! This is my most fave out of the silent hill series.
Depression backs on menu Bois
f*ck konami
I can't wait
Did not know about this. Now I'm definitely excited about the Metal Gear Solid rumors.
PC version?
SH2 Remake without a SH1 Remake?
No one is gonna comment about this game not being on PS4?!
why young leon move to silent hill ?
This game could be the rivival of Konami from the games department.
At least the voice acting seems promising...
wheres metal gear solid remake !!
silent hill .. like the movie ?
did they announce a date?
Legenda pt br brasileira exigimos isso konami
Who is the VA for James? He doesn't sound great
They should have made James a little better looking. He's looking mighty wife killery atm.
if this is a FULL remake of SH2 then count me in! please don't pull a half bothered REVIII
Not sure I’m entirely convinced that the new fog effects are an improvement. I’ve been in really thick sea fog and mountain fog. To my mind fog seems eerie because (like the original graphics) it literally is featureless and turns the world into unnaturally smooth layers, the world simply fades into whiteness.  There’s a strange sense of both claustrophobia (because it limits you to a visible bubble only a few feet wide) and a feeling of being lost in an immense expanses of nothingness. These new effects make it look like 3D billowing smoke. Which is cool in its own way, but a very different aesthetic.
Love the PT inspired cockroach opening
It’s been so long… thank you Konami ❤
1:04  She’s in, boys! She did it! She said it! *airhorns*
give us back P.T.
He looks like a discount Leon😂
This is awesome!, but why they Skip part One,!?
Aahshfkskdhajameuebz a
Where is noise effect?
Might pick up a PS5 for it
Will they include the extras that were only present in the Xbox version, Restless Dreams?
JAMES IS DIFFERENT. IN THE ORIGINAL, HE HAD A KIND FACE AND A KIND VOICE. HE WANTED TO EMPATHIZE, WANTED TO BE LIKE HIM. THE NEW JAMES HAS IT WRITTEN ON HIS FACE THAT HE IS A MURDERE
similar to the resident evil 2 remake version of leon
If games look this real now why not just make them into movies instead of games...
Oohh I member Silent Hill 2, you member? 🍇
Release date ?
SILENT HILL IS BACK, i been waiting this day so long.
I am afraid from that trailer that the music atmosphere in that remater is not as creepy as that of the original Silent Hill 2 :/
Wow, I wish Xbox could be original like PlayStation, I’ve been an Xbox fan a while and the fact that this is PlayStation exclusive makes me hate Xbox. Y’all PlayStation folks are lucky, don’t sleep on this game
.
CUANDO SALEEEEEEEE
now just let Kojima finish Silent Hills, and maybe you would redeem yourself, Konami
Каждый день, приходя домой после работы, смотрю этот трейлер. Люблю эту игру так сильно, и оттого тизер заставляет улыбаться в ожидании выхода самой игры. А Джеймс, действительно выглядящий  иначе, теперь уже смотрится таким, каким и должен быть. Два момента - взгляд Джеймса в зеркало и встреча в парке с Марией - мурашки. BlooberTeam с Konami возвращают наше детство.
A WHITE, BLOND, STRAIGHT, MALE PROTAGONIST!!!?? what is this 2001!!
VR 100000% needs to happen.
there are a couple things about james that bother me from the trailer. He looks older, but his movements & expressions don't reflect that so it feel a bit unbalanced. He moves too fast & his expressions are too animated to feel real to me. Also, a weird observation, but his hairline is too far down his forehead! It looks really unnatural.
Will there be a Shiba Inu ending?
tripledttv here, i will be streaming a longplay of this when realeased. ps5 gameplay
Honestly. I can't wait for this remake! Old graphics and very bad dubbing take away the atmosphere of this game a bit. More than that, I want to see 3 scenes, because originally... Something was missing. May it be worth saving for this game😍😍😍😍
Konami COMING BACK
Finally....waiting for long2 time
James looks a bit like Jef Dahmer
I’ve been waiting for this day 🥹
Can’t wait to see the boat 🛶 scene on next gen what it was supposed to be played on 😂
estoy dando volteretas
I hope this does well enough for a remake of SH1
Soonn, from Microsoft: "Windows 95 Remastered"
So... We truly sacrificed Fornite for the silent hill remake.
Cockroach is likely a reference to PT.
Incredible!
Someone in Konami looked at Resident Evil remake and decided to ride that train too. OK, let's hope they spend some attention to product quality.
igual se ve del 2015 XD
YES YES YES
I'd love if they did a Born From A Wish scenario that was a wee bit longer <3
"it's so foggy..."
I've never seen a single remake improve upon its source material and I'm sure I never will. This looks bad already.
נראה חרא
Como roban con los remakes dios mio...
Wow, some of my favorite games of all-time are being remade - Silent Hill 2, Resident Evil 4, Splinter Cell, Max Payne and Max Payne 2.  Now if only Rockstar will announce a Manhunt remake, I'll be totally content.
😍
we need this in ps4 😭😭😭😭😭😭
İs this coming to PC?
Can't wait
I so can't wait for this game
No shot.
Does anyone know the new voice actress playing Mary here?
Silent hill 1 : horrific Silent hill 2 : sad  Silent hill 3 : scary adventure Silent hill 4 : typical boy on quarantine Silent hill 2 remake : sadness again in HD
I’m hyped for 2023 gaming🔥 hopefully we get this and stalker 2 and ofc still waiting for darktide on series X
Hoping they manage to keep the original atmosphere and such, worried that they won't though. Either way we'll get a much better quality recording of Yamaoka's soundtrack or even new tracks
- Mary? No, you're not... - Do I look like your girlfriend?
I wasn't sure if I liked the face or voice until 2/3rds of the way through and I absolutely think it looks great.
James looks so tired and depressed...  Man, looks perfect
I really want to see Eddie and angela . Especially last moments of angela. That moment was so special
His face 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I wonder if pyramid is gonna stalk you around,like how mr.x did in the re2 remake.
Wipeout remake????????????
Nice remake graphic for silent hill 2  😄😄😄😄😄
Who tf is that? he looks nothing like James
I can't wait for silent hill 2 remake I love silent hill 2
I wish they would have let Kojima make Silent Hills With Guillermo del Toro and Norman Reedus. But they fired him and now that’s never going to happen. Would have been a masterpiece.
لابد ترجمو العبة لي الغة العربية نوجو منكم انصاف العرب
Does it have a release date yet?
YEA I WANT THIS
Who’s Eddie?
Watching Gordon destroy people both logically and emotionally is always one of the best experiences.
I really hope they don't dumb down the sensitive content (because they mentioned adjusting it for modern audiences), it's such a crucial part of the thrill and appeal of Silent Hill.
No more multiple ending please
silent hill 2 remake collector's edition 😁🎮 please make it
Leon?
I know original game is great but this trailer seems so boring.
I'm getting this sudden urge to smother my wife
I'm waiting for this to be a prank, because I do not trust Konami... I literally have trouble believing this is going to exist.
Never thought I'd say pyramid head looks beautiful! This remake is a dream come true!! 💖💖💖
Just realized my MacBook has a 4k display. game looks great can't wait to play it again.
Woah this looks insane
I want the alien ufo ending
Getting harder and harder to tell the difference between a movie and a video game.
Not ps4?  Wai?
If they don't have letters in the game I'm rioting
NO　KOJIMA　NO　SILENT　HILL　F　KONAMI
When its release pls 😭💔
The dude's face looks weird
FINALLY
I would love to be excited about this. Silent hill 2 is maybe my favourite game ever. But I must force myself to boycott anything Konami does. Seriously, it hurts me so much but integrity requires sacrifice.  Don’t support these evil people.
Best enjoyed with the whole family. PG 5yo+
imagine you are playing this horror game and out of nowhere there comes the Andrew Tate Themesong. Tourne da la vine vine
2:11 can i get to the yamszzz sweet yamzszzzzzz, show me te wayyyyy cause got bill to payyyyyyyyyyyyy
I can't be the only one who has trouble differentiating between Resident Evil and Silent Hill.
Now if this isn’t forgotten by Konami in a couple months then this’ll be the most support I’d have had for Konami in a long while.
Absolutely can’t wait for this one.
Since when is a teaser 3 mins? lolol - looking forward to this one!
Yeah! :D
Everyone’s talking about Silent Hill 2, but what about Silent Hill 3?!? 🤩
الاعظم قد عادت
SH 1 remake.. would be great also
Silent hil atrae a los más locos de mrd
Ps5 exclusive
So when? This is one of my favorites!
!!!!!
They better remaster the metal gear games now
I have 0 expectations, you better not disapoint bloober team.
I only bought the ps5 cause of this. Please don't ruin the game konami 🙏
Did anyone else ever realise that slow piano is "Paint it black" ?
The thing i didn't like about the resident evil remakes is that they removed the puzzles. The noose looks like the hanged man puzzle. So that gives me hope
it s next gen ?? Are you serious ? 😂😂😂
wow
Legend reborn
The real victim here is Pyramid Head. How much pain do you think his head, shoulders, and back are in right now?
ohhhh man i feel like they are bringing back the ps2 games but in ps5!!! do you know how crazy that is 😍😍😍😭😭
Arthritis, the silent kill 😂
Cant wait to see remaked secret Doggo 🐕 ending!
As someone who started playing and finished SH1 recently after over 2 decades from its release I can't wait to play SH2!
What if the remake is just woke version of SH2 "My name...is Maria, but sometimes I can be Mario..."
是非とも犬エンドも作って欲しい
younhave no i

Yagudin in the main role ? ))
Creo que sony odia a silent hill y a konami pero la gente  ama silent hill y no les queda otra que mantenerlo vivo para vender jaja en tu cara sony .
Jaja les faltaron b o l a s . Para el P.T. el dos fue medio decepcionante el uno y el tres eran una joyas . Ojala lo hayan mejorado sin vender fruta como hace siempre sony .  00

I hope it's not just a 1 to 1 remake with better graphics. Imagine getting to explore streets and buildings never before seen.
PEAK IS RETURNING LETS GOOOOOOOOO
bloobers been killin it, glad to see theyre involved in this
Man I am very interested to see how abstract daddy is handled in this remake
No music?
That didn't really tell me anything...
What is shown here does not have a single drop of atmosphere of the original game.
James actually looks old this time!
All those memories from earlier days of this game including Shattered Memories. holyshiit!!!!!!!!!
come on sony and konami make a playstation 4 version 🥺❤️
Is this game is horror
The pain on his face is extraordinary. This trailer is Golden
This will be terrible. From the bathroom scene alone I can already see how the developers didn't understand what made SH2 great. Way too giddy and eager to get to the twist.
حاريق وضيق يا زوامل
don't wuss out.  and talk about an underwhelming reveal for the big guy.
Did Sony also pay Konami so they don’t sell this game on Xbox ? Lol pathetic company
Silent feel 2 prepare to feel this time for real coming to you soon on a ps5 near you silent feels 2 electric boogaloo   they made James look like too much of a chump
Akira Yamaoka baby!
Accents are so strong :/
This game have few characters, the cop Cybil will can go back in this game, I like her !
Nostalgia ...
牛逼！经典！
The hills have eyes
James face is very ugly
For James!!
Ya te habías tardado Konami CTMRE
SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
It's so crazy to me I never played any of the silent hill games....literally the day I got silent hill HD remaster, they announced this...😁😁
this was epic already now in 4k itll be perfection
sinceramente este juegazo es una maldita obra de arte 😙👌x este juego si me compraría la ps5
It´s only for PS5?
I’m stiff now 😊.
Se ve chafon
This deserves to sit alongside RE8 as a PSVR2 hybrid title.  It was born for it.
please release this on PC and even PS4? huhu
Почему нельзя сразу указывать какой будет fps в игре чтоб понять ждать игру или нет
Holy mother! This happened! They heard our prayers...🙏🙏🙏
I like how they just completely abandoned Silent Hills and Silent hill 1 to make this lol
I thought Konami don't make games for home video game console anymore?
Awesome game, worst trailer ever
Unos kraks
Officially now waiting for REmake the Remake..... we've entered the age of stalemate in creativity.. let's just innovate everything.... This is why Indie game developers will take over.  Only remake I'm excited for is Deadspace... it better be a remake... and they better do the sound engineering justice.
Uhhhhhhh... why does the original bathroom scene look better than this? Also... really not digging what they did to James' face....  Sad that the PS2 graphics, although ahead of their time, stand better than this teaser for new gen.... sad.
eventually they won't need actors. they'll have AI graphics and just make films like this. sad
Leon tá me feio nesse jogo mds
PC tho :(
Bring it as soon as possible!! I can’t wait anymore!❤
El juego más sobrevalorado de play station
Why james sunderland not handsome just like Leon Kennedy 😐
*_...I'm sorry, what?_*
Looks too cool to be true!
1:53, that MGSV sound...
They will f**k up this game, you will see. Same as with remastered Mafia. SIlent Hill 2 is already perfect. New graphis will make it worse, you will see. :)
А где Норман Ридус и Кодзимыч? Что за дела!
Man this looks freakin awesome..so realistic..unreal engine 5 is a thing...
Guess I need to find a PS5 now 😅
I love this game I remember playing it on ps2 I was in the end of the game but I never finish is 😔
Oooh Konami is back why not Remake Metal Gear 1,2, and 3 pls
Please please PLEASE I hope they don't mess this up
They just need to do a remake of the original Silent Hill while they’re at it
Konami les comiques qui ont détruit pes
Why not silent hill 3
I hope it will come with Arabic language
некст ген не удался
2:11 Brutal.
When I was in class 6, I used to play Silent Hills on my PSP along with my elder sister because I used to get scared 😂and now I’m excited to play this beautiful game on my PS5❤
The Triangular head always give me the creeps.
y el 1 ?
I'm going to miss the old controls
just finished The Medium and can't wait to see what Bloober will serve in here :)
I'm sick and tired of gaming companies recyling old games.
oha yeniden mi çıkıyor ! ps5 alasım geldi
I honestly cannot believe this I literally wished for this every Christmas for years now thank you Konami ✊🏼✊🏼✊🏼
I love how Konami makes remakes true to their original and doesn't gender or color swap
It just doesn't feel the same, like they're trying too hard unveiling the mystery. I'm starting to get tired of remakes because the writers think they're making the games better by changing script, but it's that script in the original that made the game special. I was so disappointed in the RE remake when they got rid of the "You were almost a Jill sandwich" line, yeah it was cheesy, but it was something I was honestly looking forward to because it was so legendary. But joke dialogue aside, I'm sure most of you get what I'm saying at least.
im not hearing nobody out
Ps4 :'( ?
I got to say this Silent Hill 1 is better and 1999 Players fully experienced the gore and horror of this game. NO YOUTUBE tutorials, NO YOUTUBE walkthrough, NO YOUTUBE for maze, clues and puzzles
No new content. Make something new.
How can you have a Silent Hill 2 teaser without the theme of Laura? ...
still cannot grasp the new face of James Sunderland.. He looks too different
Parece Ucrania 😔
The legend
vou ter que jogar
Coughs "what about Silent Hill Origins and Silent hill 1 remakes?" I hope just because we're getting 2 Remastered that this means we won't be missing out on the those two getting a remake.
Mi 2023 🤩
Can we get metal gear solid now Konami?
So Fword You KNM
hope they keep the rowboat
Maybe call it "Sillent Hill 2 Remake could be useful.
Nice graphics ❤️
J.Wick's Style
I need silent Hill 1 next gen graphic
I always wanted to play this game. Now I can.
Seems like I am going to buy a Playstation 5...
bloober team studio, all its games have Metacritic below 80, which means their games are awful, why should they remake a masterpiece game like Silent Hill 2?
Bloober Why???
This ones going to be shocking!
If this isn't x rated I will be disappointed
One of the best game of PS1 Exited 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🔥
Konami better not mess this up. They threw away Hideo Kojima, destroyed the Metal Gear Franchise and ruined their reputation. They better not destroy Silent Hill again.
Just finished replaying on my PS2, such a great game. Lots of fan service here in the trailer, am kind of suspicious about some changes in the art design. Like pyramid head attacking the mannequins, James lookin like he at my abuelas house or something, that apartment is way too cozy.
Why james not handsome just like Leon Kennedy our Alan wake ?
Change that ugly face james
James face is awful 😖
James face is very ugly
Covardia fazer exclusivo. Fora isso
Why it took them so long 22 years to do a Remake? Did they release Silent Hill 3 after these years?
well out they will release the remake bornout 3: takedown
There was a hole here now its gone.
I was waiting for PT... this doesn't look scary...
Dovrebbe essere interessante sto gioco!!! 🙄🙄😍
Silent hill was bad back in the day, it will continue to be so. Move along people, nothing to see here
Solo puedo decir , que lo voy a gozar ,como no lo puedes imaginar
Playstation has all the best games it's crazy
Nice...but why does he reminds me on LEON from RE ;-)
I hope they get monster glitching right
You cant just cross over RE 4 to Silent Hill 2
What is the purpose of putting a chad, 20-year smoking voice for James? He is supposed to sound naive, entirely confused and depressed. This one just sounds like a 50 year old war veteran. Please don't let this be another Troy Baker incident.
The ending always get me 😢
f*ckkonami
🖤
Why james sunderland new face is so ugly and old? Why james not handsome just like Leon Kennedy our Alan wake?
That's nice. Though I probably won't get it since I already finished the game. Would be nice if they make a new silent hill though. Remakes are nice, better graphics and all but I wouldn't get a remake just to play the same game again in better quality.
This is why playstation is the stuff.
It's so foggy...
2:20 - 2:28 does this part of the song sound familiar? Just for huge fans out there...
Ada satu hal sangat menarik buat saya, game ini sangat menyeramkan.
i just hope they keep the weird speech patterns in all honesty
Is this also going to be ps exclusive?
In case you guys didn't see it, bloober is the reason this has happened. Konami doesn't deserve the credit. 😂
So glad this is finally happening.
YES.
I can't wait anymore!
I want 2nd trailer
Bro he looks like Markiplier
Just watching some game trailers like death stranding, silent hill 2, etc. Just realised how we need this sort of craziness in games. Such deep themes being portrayed and conveyed so artistically in a way films find hard to achieve. It's just so beautiful.
PS4 can easily handle the graphics of this game. but I think you didn't release the game on ps4 just to sell consoles for trade logic. You are making a mistake, producing new games for each console's own system will bring you more profit. On the other hand, produce a new generation console for those looking for a new console and more powerful graphics. but keep game production for each console.
wouldnt be the same without kojima
Leon S. Kennedy is that you!???
Second game has a remastered.
Feels like a fever dream
What's going on with his face? The orginal looked more realistic.
Bro This is a big NO
Plzz release this game ps4 console I request you sony plzz i m biggest fan silent Hill by godness😢🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Chills
I'd like to see a remake of sh1 🤗
It's you!LEON!
I hope Maria is not ugly like James. Do you mean Angela and Eddie's faces have also changed? Does that mean they become ugly like James? James' new face is awful
I hope there are at least some developers from the original who take care of their game. Not that it ends like Resident Evil 3.
The question that needs to be asked is, SHOULD Silent Hill 2 be remade?
😍😍😍😱😱😱
That's cool and all.. But dog ending where?
Why james not handsome just like Leon Kennedy? Why all characters silent hill is ugly. Of course, Henry and Alex are handsome
Luke Roberts is even uglier than Norman Reedus. No, I regret it, Norman Reedus is much uglier. Why are the protagonists of Silent Hill so ugly? Until now, only Henry Townshend is considered the most handsome character of Silent Hill. Alex Shepard is also handsome. So why is the new face of James so ugly?
Why did James turn from a 29-year-old into an ugly 50-year-old? At least you used an attractive face for James, why is he so ugly?
Please change james face is he very ugly
Game yang banyak gagalnya dibanding RE, padahal film.nya sangat amat terkenal dan bagus Semoga game Silent Hill ini nanti bisa bersaing dengan RE
I never played this before…22 now tho n ima cop this on release lol
❤❤❤
Imagine they do pyramid head hunts you down randomly like tyrant from R.E 2 remake,  my hopes are up can't wait for these new silent hill games , bout time Konami
Juegazo
Ах,как жаль что у меня 4 плойка...ладно,все равно не работает магазин
Just beat the original. No way this does anything but butcher it. Talk about a remake that's obsolete upon conception.
Hope, later in 2024, Silent HIll 1 and 3 get a proper remake like this one ^^. Sure the'll release a new trailer, because i miss Angela and Eddie in this one. FInally the "horror' games are getting the spot light now.  Could Legacy of Kain be there too??
Konami for the win bringing silent hill back, also please revive castlevania!
cant wait to see the doggo
James new face is very ugly
Change james face
Leon in Resident Evil 2 is very young and handsome, or for example, Alan Wake in Alan Wake 2 is also very handsome, why is James so ugly?
The new face of James is even uglier than the monsters of Silent Hill
Why isn't James as handsome and young as Ethan Winters? Why so old and ugly? James's face is even uglier than the monsters of Silent Hill 🤣
Luke roberts very ugly 🤢
PH doesn’t look very dirty. He looks like he might even smell decent. Maybe cuz he just came out the rain
Just like portoganist of The Medium game was very ugly and messed up, unfortunately James is also very ugly in Silent Hill 2 remake, unfortunately portoganists of bloober team games are always old and ugly, for example portoganist of Observer game is a disgrace, an ugly old man, worse shape and fat 🤮
bloober team, why are the main characters of your games always old and ugly?
Capcom target in Resident Evil is young gamers, that's why it sold the game, why are the characters of Silent Hill all old and ugly? At least the team silent made young and handsome characters, even in Silent Hill 2, James is very young and handsome, or for example, Henry is only 20 years old in Silent Hill 4, but why is James so old and ugly in Silent Hill 2 remake? Bloober your taste in face selection is awful
Why is James so old and ugly? Do you really want to increase game sales like this? Gamers love young and beautiful characters, not addicted and thin and ugly characters
Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil 2 remake very handsome and charming but why james sunderland in silent hill 2 remake is very old and ugly? 😡
Stop ruining my baby
Remember this is coming from the same publisher that lost the source code for the second game, demanded that the third be rewritten to be less dark and flat out demanded the fourth be changed to include more references to previous entries. Every game since has shuttered its developer due to unrealistic deadlines and the denial of royalties. My expectations are through the floor.
If you own a PS5 and don't buy this game you're wasting the system and will be required to switch to Xbox or switch by the end of the year of release.
Is it really happening tho
i know i can’t be the only who literally jumped in excitement for this remake lol
Rip silent hill pt 😢
When did anyone played a game by konami last time?
I have to get this I was hoping for remake of SH 1 but I'll take SH 2
Silent Hill horripilante de mais 👏👏👏👏👏
I remeber that game i couldn't play about 20 years ago ...Silent Hill
When Parasite Eve will be remembered/revisited..?
Se ve hermoso ... He visto el trailer como 10 veces :(   ( que bonita la musica de cuando James encuentra a Maria .... )
Silent Hill 1 is reeallly needed to be remastered. P.S. Akira Yamaoka is the best
That chord after she says, “silent hill,” is so 🤌😮‍💨
Silent hill,is like seeing a ghost from the past,a brother from high school,17 years back
Why is it a PS exclusive? 😭
A falta de creatividad y talento, Konami como Capcom lucran con nuestra nostalgia sacando Remakes de juegos icónicos que recordamos con amor. MEJOR PÓNGANSE A TRABAJAR EN UN NUEVO SILENT HILL, OPORTUNISTAS.
where is the old ost
Hermoso
Remake.
James face looks like Sean Bean' s face
I need news, release date, gameplay, anything.
Gracias Konami
0:34 Robert De Niro Sunderland
I'm so excited
James Sunderland is like Leon Kennedy to Resident Evil. So it deserves a trilogy
Konami please make a Silent Hill trilogy starring James Sunderland. He deserves it
I hope James is in the next episodes of Silent Hill because he is a really likable character. Konami, why don't you use the classic characters of Silent Hill in the next episodes like Resident Evil? For example, Leon is present in most Resident Evils. So why did James only appear in Silent Hill 2? I hope James can have a trilogy of his own in Silent Hill
I come back to this trailer from time to time and every time I get shivers. I hope they manage to keep the magic of the original. And reliving the traumas of James, Angela and Eddy on Unreal Engine 5 will be something amazing !!!
Gostava daquela ideia do Silent Hill com o Norman Reedus
Love franchise but this looks cheap
THE GAME IS AMAZING
VIVA SILENT HILL 2
Strange developer choice
Bloober team? Yikes
Can I play this if I haven't played a single silent hill game in my life?
Where is the music????? The ost original game?
That no is silent hill2 That is scrap whit out the original music.
Luke roberts very ugly
James face awful
Everyone is making fun of James's face in that stupid sequence when James enters the elevator, why is he looking at the camera in that ugly way? The same stupid sequence has now become a meme. Which idiot suggested James to make such a ridiculous look in that sequence?
James sunderland original is handsome  Henry Townshend is handsome  Alex shepherd is handsome  Murphy pendleton is handsome  Why james sunderland in remake version so ugly?
Change james face all fans mock james new face
What about Silent Hill 1 Remake ??
this. looks. amazing.
I need the PC version on Steam
I can tell this will blow heavy wet farts and it’s all just to advertise the new movie… soulless.
Now we can suffer again. In hd
Will thus be open world?
James is not like James, why is he so emotional? You have ruined the whole idea of ​​the original game. James should not be an emotional person, he should be a delusional person
James face very ugly please change that face
Change james face please 🙏
Maria's character model is going to be as popular as Lady Dimitrescu.
SH2 was great, but this trailer is kinda meh
The biggest horror is that they making remake
Too bad its esclusive.
Sieht gut aus, wird aber niemals, nicht mal annähernd ans PS 2 original ran kommen... Original bleibt original
❤️
Silent Hill 2 broke me, it was probably the most beautiful game I've ever played, and the fact it's being remade is a blessing
Silent Hill we missed you old friend. 🫂
Nobody remembers PT? Wasn't PT supposed to have been the new Silent Hill that got canned?
Me with a ps4 🧍
Imagine they released this In VR and we actually got to go into this town.
Celebrate 6 million views. Just tell us release date right now konami !!!
I'm not your Mary
Incrível, simplismente incrível.Estão com essa obra prima nas mão,espero que traga silent hill de volta!.
JAMESSSS !!! YOU MADE ME HAPPY !!!!!!!!
I'm curious about it but... Where are the dirt, the gory and the darkness ? Can't see it.
Ah my favorite part
noce
ok
This was my very favorite SH game (apart from SH1) and I return to YT from time to time to rewatch SHN play it over and over again. PT played by Delirious or SHN is another I watch regularly.
Are they gonna use the voice overs from the original ps2 version (the best one)?
There was a hole here. It’s gone now
I might watch this trailer everyday in till game comes out 🫡
6 Millions!!
The greatest survival horror game of all time has returned.
konami please, please bring back metal gear, i miss it so much
nossa isso vai ser tão ruim... espero que eu esteja errada
So is this another part? Or remake?
James' voice sounds more like the HD version than the original
I have ps4 why not for ps4 I don't have money to buy ps5 why are you doing this with people like me
Where the heck is the guitar?!
James is older 😂
If yall ever wanna remake silent hill 4... I will gladly take that insanity again. I know it's not the most popular one but wow that one lingered with me the most.
James Sunderland is the ugliest video game hero I've ever seen. Why did you make him so ugly? He was very handsome in the original version. Luke Roberts face is very ugly
We want young and handsome characters, not old and ugly characters in Silent Hill. James face is very bad, it should be changed.
Alan Wake in Alan Wake 2 is very handsome and charming, so why is James so ugly and old? Isn't your goal to attract young gamers? so why is the hero of the game so old and ugly?
Leon is very handsome and young in Resident Evil 2 remake, but why is James old and ugly in Silent Hill 2 remake?
🎉
More PlayStation exclusives, huh? Fantastic..
konami remembering that games are also playable on consoles an PCs not only mobile
In my restless dreams. I see that game. Silent Hill. Konami promised they'd take me there again someday...  Edit: l Lol wow, the animosity fellas. It's just a game; and a beloved one at that. I'm just glad my life isn't as unfortunate as the ones finding ways to put down the people who enjoy it. I hope you are well, really I do. It's a  franchise many like myself hope to see revived because we enjoy a great escape from the reality that is real life. I hope all of you well, and the best of luck to be happy.
Top demais.
Alan wake in Alan wake 2 very handsome and hot but why james sunderland in silent hill 2 remake is very ugly 😐
Alan wake in Alan wake 2 very handsome and leon kennedy in Resident Evil 2 remake is very handsome but why james sunderland in silent hill 2 remake is so ugly?
I don't play on PS4 but I do love PS4 games. I am an xbox player.
Dude Pyramid head looks f****** creepy as f
3 upcoming silent hill games
Lütfen bu oyunda Türkçe dil desteği olsun çocukluğumun oyunu
2:04 newbies get trolled
🔥🔥🔥😍♥️♥️
5.9 million views.  Konami just needing a solid reminder that this franchise is beloved world wide.
i can't wait to see the "in water" ending remade :)
Can’t wait to see a photorealistic PS5 rendering of the dog ending.
I hate James Sunderland face in Silent Hill 2 Remake why is he so ugly?
Luke roberts very ugly 🤢
This game whatsoever doesn't make any sense!!  RE still the best
This game won’t run on any modern hardware
Why remaking 2 before 1?
I honestly believe they couldn’t have picked a better developer to remake this classic game. Bloober  teams observer and the medium always felt like they were in the same vein as silent hill, especially the medium. Fingers crossed on this one 🤞
посмотрим что получится. Есть конечно ощущение что можем разочароваться, но надежда есть всегда. Да когда-то в начале помню и 4 часть обливали, пока в остальные не поиграли. Тут все таки интерпретация, плюс норм графика, да и надеюсь Акира не потерял хватку. Вы как хотите, но я верю!!!
Leon Kennedy is so young and handsome in Resident Evil 2 Remake, all young gamers fall in love with that guy, but why is James so old and ugly in Silent Hill 2 Remake?
bloober team why did you make James so old and ugly? Everyone on reddit and twitter is teasing James' new face, does this mean the original game will be as horrible as James' face? Please ignore the ugly face of Luke Roberts
bloober team why did you make James so old and ugly? Everyone on reddit and twitter is teasing James' new face, does this mean the original game will be as horrible as James' face? Please ignore the ugly face of Luke Roberts
Why is James so old? James should be a handsome 28-year-old, not a skinny, ugly 50-year-old.
Perfection...
🖤
Silent hill um dos melhores jogos e sagas dos games, deveriam investir mais...
wait, what about Silent Hill 1 ?
If this succeeds mgs remake pls🙃
James looks like William Birkin
Alan wake in Alan wake 2 very very handsome but why james sunderland in silent hill 2 remake is very very ugly?
Konami, you couldn't even make a beautiful face for James, then how are you going to remake Silent Hill 2?
James face is the ugliest face I have ever seen in my life why did you make it so ugly? 🤬
James face is awful 😖
James face is awful why is he so thin and old and why is he so ugly? 😡
Why james not handsome just like Leon Kennedy ☹️
Why james is so old and ugly ☹️
Why james is so old 😐
Never been this excited for a game before
I'm cautiously optimistic, but really skeptical of this, and you all should be too.. From what I saw here, they really don't seem to understand James' character.
Silent hill 2 pachinko REMAKE
Tiembla resident evil
I have to keep coming back to this trailer just to make sure I'm not dreaming. 23 years ago I was running through the fog of Silent Hill, and here I am nearly 40yrs old and about to experience it again. What a time to be alive.
just wondering, what happened to Silent Hill 1? the best game of them all? :O
Its finally here the legendary game of all horror games
the opening remind me of p.t.
Legendary Akira yamaoka i like you men
I can wait see the gameplay on the next playstation showcase, the best horror game 🗿🍷
Got me a PlayStation for games like this let's gooo!
This is so cool I’m like crying lol I kinda wish it was a movie but I’m so buying this one for shore
I'm really scared they're gonna destroy the franchise but, I'm excited to see this games rebirth.
The original is bettet
I remember that silent hill 2 in xbox and ps2
可千万别出幺蛾子😂
Can't wait for this game to release
i don't know how to feel about this.
I hope pyramid head chases you around
But please change his face
Now all Konami has to do is make some visual upgrades and release the MGS games on new consoles and pc
James face very very ugly
James 28 years old not 50😐
Why james is so old😐
Leon Kennedy in resident evil 2 remake young and handsome but james in silent hill 2 remake old and very ugly 😐
…俺はこれを待っていたんだ 何年も何年も・・  ありがとう KONAMI🍀  .。⭐️  必ずプレイするよ🎮️
Ese james se parece a blonsky de abomination
Why are people hating on James’s face,  literally see nothing wrong
0:36 Those notes almost sound like Paint it black.
Welcome to Centralia, I mean Silent Hill.
how many people are coming back everyday?!
gente, tem remake do 1?
Still wondering what could have been with Kojima and Del Toro. 😢  …. but okay….
Wish silent hills were made..
Is this real? Can I celebrate?
James face is very ugly
You know what's amazing about silent hill games they don't need to make new ones they just need to remake the old ones and they will still sell millions, silent hill two and three are terrifying games I can't wait.
I still think he look more handsome in the ps2 model
They did a major downgrade on James' looks
what are the chances they mess this up? ;)
I can't wait for another TRSH Experience of Twin Perfect.
This is resident evil 4 ! Like Leon😂
Turk Confirmed 0:05
plz add hindi subtitles in the game
Man I LOVE silent hill 2 , Im so excited!
Best game in the history of mankind right there .
espero que no lo vallan a cagar , el silent hill 2 es una OBRA DE ARTE , ojala que sea fiel al SH2 original que siga con el terror psicológico que caracterizaba a los 4 primeros juegos , y no un shooter como hicieron con el sh5 que parecía mas bien  un residen evil., y tambien espero que o hagan con los 6 posibles finales del juego
[ Everyone liked that. ]
20 fricking years........
What about 1؟
😐 0:43 In the mirror scene in the original game, the main character looks directly at the player, breaking the fourth wall. Usually you don't see this until you increase the contrast and brightness. But this video doesn't do that. Well, it's a shame that it's probably just going to be a superficial copy without any communication with Team Silent.
The developers have run out of ideas So they remake remake and remake And console players are strangely happy with the game remake
The Dog Ending better come back
I need to play this.
2:11 is that how his wife passed? 😬
I like how they remastering the old games those are legendary than the one are making now
I need a release date... NOW!!!
Im so excited
What happened to James?
Esta cool el nuevo resident Evil 4 reamake
And longest living character! And did anyone unlock silent hill civil war long live confederate marine corp war chief!
I can fix him 🥺
Бляяя ребят сделайте нормально, прошу вас! Я ради этого PS5 куплю!
*"I'm ready . . ."*
Am I the only one that thinks silent hill 3 was amazing?
Love this game so much!
Luke Roberts, the voice actor of the main character sounds awesome. Can't wait for the game to be released.
I wonder if they will remake 1,3,4
Along with resident evil 4 remake, I'm so pumped for this.
Thank you for this! Try to remake metal gear solid also… Thank you 🙏
in my restless dreams I have been craving for this for many MANY years. and suddently I am 38 now😆
oh that so scare
Porque não fizeram Remakr do silente Hill 1 ?
Konami back to produce video game again?
We've been waiting.
Besides Bloodborne, this is the only must-buy. Ever!
Trophy earned "you lived to see silent hill make a comeback"
Why didn't they start with SH1 though? 🤔
Cool, are they gonna remake the pachislot game too?
Yesssssss finally!!!!!!!Why not starting with silent hill 1 tho?
Hope they got Cameron Diaz playing Maria. Hehe.
I was told this is only for Playstation 😭
when its coming for pc?
Ok... Eu preciso urgentemente de um PS5
My all time favorite silent hill
сразу видно,  Джамес тут лошпедон😋
So... What about Silent hill f?
I want the track music at 2:30 plz😔
Looks soulless.
Can’t wait to hear Laura’s theme
Cant wait to buy a ps5 to play this then immediately sell it once I beat it.
One <<3
Dog ending with Mira going be best ending ever in remake
In my restless dream. I seen that game, Silent Hill. They promised to make that game someday, but they already did. Well, I'm waiting there for now. In my special day. Waiting for this.
Anyone love the shot of James entering that hallway just swingin at the nurse. Dude was puttin his soul into those swings he was letting that creature have it. Was oddly satisfying..... go on james!!
Should've kept original voices
Is this what James was supposed to sound like?
It’s crazy that they’re remaking the silent hill hd collection. That’s a great sign
Everyone worried about blooper team making a silent hill game and then they confirm it’s a remake and the balloon deflating with “it’s just silent hill 2 again”
when james is washing his hands in the bathroom the sound of the pt is heard when norman reedus turns around and shows his face
Just Finished Silent Hill 2 today and I got "Leave" Ending hahaha.
2:43   His head went through
2:04 That shot Right there Just perfectly exemplifies pure dread from suffering depression At least imo It just looks amazing, not only due to the graphics but also just the shot itself
Essa trilha sonora no final me quebrou todo... Mary..
No gameplay?
why is it that james is saying he really isn't obsessed with mary anymore. shouldn't he really be obsessed with finding Mary's whereabouts as if he really needed her
Silent Hill 1 Remake pls
Crappy trailer.
😫😭🫂
Is this on pc too?
Se les acabó la plata por eso ahora sacan juegos del año de la corneta
Like Leon S kennedy
Leon is that you?
Why are people hating on this. This looks absolutely incredible like the best horror remake I’ve ever seen
Welcome to the PlayStation 3.
Silent hill 2 with its epic graphics❤
Can't wait to play this game
PARECE O LION SCOTT KENNEDY
100 % real fan all games all endings
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👌👌👌👌👌
RE mah smenjak kena leon re 4 ps 2 horor ma teka tekinya ilang kalau silent hill kentel bgt itu teka teki ma horrornya belum survivalnya senjatanya pun piso tv pipaledeng aaaah jadi pengen
Ladies & Gentlemen It's time to return to Silent Hill!
RE is a way better series for me..
😱😍😍😍😍😍шикарно
2:20 silent hill 1 music intro remix
they start the remake with sh2. same move like capcom with RE2 .why not start with sh0 or sh1.
Need it on Xbox before I Sue
PlayStation exclusive!
Just in time I finally buyed a PS5 XD
This is probably my favourite game ever, I've played it countless times, got every possible ending and Im happy to do so again.
Can’t wait to see Angela again and have my heart broken!!
My expectations are lower than dirt.
OLHA ESSES RAIOS DE LUZZ QUE BACANA, BUNITO
Nice 😎
Why does he look like David Lynch this time?   *_Uncanny_*
2:38 Gives me chills.
Easily the best game ever created. Please do the remake right!!
The last silent game i played was for the ps3 silent hill home coming 😬😬😬
Just when we thought Konami was going to succumb to gambling machines and mobile games!
just saying if you release this to pc itd be awesome
Gonna get a ps5 for now sure
Beautiful graphics, obviously, but I worry that it removes some of the deliberate ambiguity and therefore the mood. In the original bathroom scene, James's expression is unreadable and his face is cast in deep shadow. He's looking into his eyes, but his eyes are just shadows staring back at him. I think that's an important detail that this remaster is sacrificing in exchange for higher graphical fidelity. But putting that aside, I really hope this remake will recapture the unique tone of the classic game.
Lol graphics look like ps2.
Forgive me if I have no faith in Konami to get this right.
They could have released the trailer with PS4 graphics. But for a PS3, it's fine!
The soundtrack is always memoriable.. Unforget.. Like resident evil theme save
SH 1/2/3 on PS classics  The remake its ok but i think the people needs to play the originals too
I hope new silent hill movie or episodes come out soon
looks dope
Couod swear the thumb was Silent Hills
AMAZING TRAILER👍👍👍
Silent Hill, the best horror game ever
$$$
They kind of made James looks like an middle age asian guy that still trying to rock a full dye blonde hair.
Por que hacen el remake del 2 antes que el del 1? El 2 es un juegazo increible obvio, pero el 1 es legendario tambien
only ps5 platform?? not ps4?
"Here for this!"
NO WAY
SO HYPED BROO
2:20 music <3
I love it
Is this what PT was based off of?
This looks too clean... I like the grim and gritty visuals of the original, it has more impact.. Darker atmosphere
Can’t wait❤
felt like a flashbang at the end
Чет он очень грустный, надо что бы веселее был. Какой то суиецидальный деад инсайд...
Sh 2 is the best psychological horror game ever created.
To think this was all because of a dog
[Creepy Spanish guitar intensifies]
Just that shot of him coming out of the bathroom... the level of detail and the wind ruffling everything is insane.
IMO they are just milking the consumer market. This game was a masterpiece and didn't need to be remade. I would even say that the PS2 graphics added to the charm of the original. Same with Resident Evil 4 remake. They're just remaking games because they have no creativity. And new fans just throw their cash at them.
James Sunderland 🔥
I wonder if all the SH Games will get remade/remastered? Can't go wrong with SH2, this game was in a class by itself
А с первой что?
_last caturday_
Its about time silent hill coming to ps5  yeahhhhh
the trailer for silent hill 2 the sound should be war pigs from black sabbath from 1:22 the then end of the trailer and from the song 4:40 to the end
Hope they didn’t change the voice actor for Mary/Maria.  It sounded very similar in the trailer so I’m keeping my hopes high.
Admito que a ansiedade está mais de 8 mil 😞😞😞😞
Духота. Никакого саспенса и напряжения в трейлере нет.
does it come to pc 1 year after or at the same time?
I want them to add the shiba ending
Imagine watching the dog ending with this graphics
Rip xbox
Please music 2:30
I hope they make a remake from the Metal Gear Solid franchise ❤😢
This is what you get when you live in Erie, Pennsylvania
"Dolor para sufrir, Sufrir para entender, Entender para ser perdonado"
Petition for konami to make Silent Hill Shattered Memories and Origins remake ✋
I need someone to make a 1 hour loop of the song that starts playing at 2:30. It’s so intoxicating, i’ve literally replayed that part so many times just to hear that song.
Me da más nostalgia este nuevo silent hill 2 que el resident evil 4
Silent is scary because its based on real ghost towns.. Without all the happy people.. Life is pretty spooky. 😆
왜 제임스 얼굴을 저렇게 바꿨지... 서양인 같지가 않고 그냥 머리 염색한 일본인처럼 보임
1:38 This is why you're my favorite youtuber you make amazing content for us every day
I'm so in, I loved Silent Hill back in the day. The game creeped me out but I loved it!
Everyone’s favourite SH for real here
only on ps5?
终于有重制版了，我和儿子又可以聊天交流
The graphics are so "advanced" that Pyramid Head's skin looks smoother than mine lol
why did they make him ugly.
Why didn't they make a silent hill 1 remake while they were at it? Both 1 and 2 are awesome
When is this coming out?
The character looks like leon Kennedy from resident evil 2 remake
Honestly even if the remake turns out bad or disappointing, I'm just happy that my favorite piece of media is getting some love
Silent Hill is one of the three most needed Ramakes!!!  Now I only have to waitin‘ for Dino Crisis and Legend of Dragoon 😅🤓
Jogou sujo , colocou esse jogo no PS5 pra obrigar a gente a comprar esse vídeo game , foda 😢 Partiu comprar !
So.. This time is truth? But I would really like if norman reedus were the mean character, but I guess they couldn't talk with him or maybe he didn't accept :(
fantastic 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👌
I hope one day to see FREEDOM FIGHTERS 2
Wow 😯
Why not remake 1 though I'm just curious I thought it was great
Leon was that you??
They better get the atmospheric music and overall sound design spot on
now I want to see the dog ending in 4K please Konami don't let me down, because my hype is way up there
Não poderia ficar mais desapontado. Ausência total do elemento do verdadeiro Silent Hill. parece jogo de super heroi. Pyramid head com a pele lizinha... que isso cara isso é uma vergonha gente
Why did they remove the patches from his jacket?
CAn we buy some PS5's tho? lol
I expect the soundtrack be ing better than that...
как же я жду эту игру... Персональный ад для персонажей... Захватывающий сюжет и чашка кофе в конце на раздумья
nice to see that konami is repeating its mistake of using 3rd party developers and never learning their lesson. Why dont they just outsource the whole thing to india
The more I watch this the better it looks
Я бы шибко так не радовался судя по тому, что выходило под данной франшизой в последнее время. Учитывая слова одного из разработчиков игры, что студия "Team Silent" была разогнана из-за того, что игра не удовлетворяла представлениям компании о готовом продукте, вряд ли Konami вдруг решит передумать и все переработать.
In my restless dreams, I see that town... 😭
Где музыка культовая?
Why xd
If their was ever a game that deserved a remake . . .   then THIS is it!
Awesome trailer!  Now, I know where to get the game and controller and literally ANY accessorie that is made for it, just gotta ...find..a system..🤔
Not visually impressive at all
Can anyone tell me what's the difference with silent hill 2, silent hill f and silent hill ascencion???
I can't wait for James to find a pachinko machine in the bowling alley and just fall to his knees in despair.
themed pachinko machine coming to you next
it's kinda funny if you think about it. konami made this game into a pachinko machine and forgot about it for years lol. now that they saw capcoms resident evil remakes success now they wanna do it too.
Have you tried reporting Nobel prize accounts all social media and other bs lol Liberating
Have you tried reporting Nobel prize accounts all social media and other bs lol Liberating
Silent Hill downpour was one of those games that was so fun all the nostalgia from when I played it back in the day
حماس
bring it to ps vita
....He's face had degraded... where is my handsome guy.. btw this is a amazing project.
2:10 this is gameplay?
When is it released? Sorry if I missed it in the trailer.
Radio intensifies
Finally a true next gen game. This game is going to be running on Unreal Engine 5 and I bet that everyting we see in this trailer is in real-time running on PS5. I am so hyped!!!!! T_T thanks Konami for making PS5 worth turning on. Everyday I am truning on my PS5 just to play these cross gen unworthy titiles. Now it is going to be truly worthy this time. Power of the PS5 in the palm of dualsense to play Silent Hill 2.
Why can’t any of these game trailers just show the game instead of being insanely over dramatic
Feel like alan wake
Wow, this looks amazing 😍 makes me actually want to buy a PS5
I'm here for Akira Yamaoka
Literally iconic
Inacreditável👏🔥
How could you not do a remaster of part one the true classic??smh
Is this real?
The Norman Redus trailer was better ngl
Guy Cihi is James! Why remake a masterpiece? couldnt they have remade one of the crappy ones?!
Too sad game…
I can't tell you how hyped I am for this! This experience is something I always think about around midnight and I'm going to have a blast with it at that time when this releases!!!
Bg windah harus main game ini ni
Leon old version
Is this game exclusive to playstation?
too emotive james is very cringe yes
Lik
Love how you can see the indent of his wedding ring on his finger in the beginning. Very telling
Oh nice. This'll be fun to check out
lived in brantford for about 5 years where they filmed silent hill. there was always a creepy feeling in the back of my mind even when sleeping in my cozy bed.
I hope they release that jingle at the end as a full song
Me: Silent Hill 2?  Remake: do i look like your video game?
This is sooo awesome👏👏👏
In my opinion all the Ps1 catalogue or the a lot of them need to be remade because they looked so dated.
Where one..?
Wow, the trailer looks absolutely gorgeous, great job to all people involved!
I can't even express how excited I am for this.
I'm ready
It scares me at how realistic this game looks
1:35 "i know what you are" **inserts the white dog with long face**
Epic
You don’t get to just shoot everybody like in resident evil huh?
يا اللهي على هل لعبة
уже в начале спалил весь сюжетный твист
Just start making original and quality new games ffs... stop milking already existing ones.
Available on PS4 or not?
naol
Now who knows when we will actually get to play it
For PS5 but with PS3 graphics
Game paling surem dan menyeramkan yang pernah aku mainkan
Por favor no lo arruinen
We don't look for old games, we look for the memories they carry.
Nice too see Leon doing well
im gonna have to play this again. teenage me made it near the end and quit lol. couldn’t do it. maybe adult me can
Lah mirip leon
Lol where do you even find a PS5
Leon is that you?
Unfortunately the most beautiful thing about this game I did not find in this Trailer.. School ghosts ..etc .. that was a true horror
Developed by Bloober?? NICE
I need days gone 2
Bloober team... hm... well let's hope it's better than Blair witch.
I hope this music isn't indicative of the final game cuz it sound super generic, no atmosphere no identity, I wonder if theyre doing their own take on the sound track or remaking the original, tbh i cant see it being "reimagined" it has to be like the original thats so much of what made it great
thhheeeee best horror game ever . thanks to konami
Una lástima que no salga para ps4
no playable trailer lol
Леон на минималках -_-
Why did not remake silent hill 1
The voice acting sounds a little better (as much as I did like the original) His look of perpetual despair really fits the part. Hurry up and take my money.
shut up and take my money
Can't wait for the pizza scene.
WOW
SH2 Remake James kind of looks like an older Murphy from SH Downpour.
one of the most boring and anti-climatic video game trailers I've ever seen lol
Konami been hurting every since wats his name left 😆 he took is silent Hill concept (P.T.) sold it to Capcom which they then used it for resident evil 7 an now resident evil is back on the map ....the salt is real
let's hope silent hill ranch isn't in the comic sans font
Is he the same actor that played Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil 2 Remake?
Does Konami not make any of its games or does it farm everything out?
El tema musical es de silent hill Downpour?
Angela Orosco :'((((((
Angela Orosco :'((((((((((((((((((((((
I’m literally upgrading my computer soon just so I can play this game.
Chasqueadores?
Pooper Team! Pooper Team!
Just take my money
But will I be able to fist a toilet in 4k?
I LOVE SILENT HILL SO MUCH .
Poor dude, hasn't aged a bit after 20 years, trapped in the Silent Hill, sigh...
I still remembered that day when the Silent Hill with an s which is Silent Hills was in the making. I don't know if it was a movie or a game but they cancelled it. Now seeing this makes me happy. I played Silent Hill: Shattered Memories in psp back in hs. It was such a cool horror thing to see in a game as a kid. The sound of a child wanting for help, or a cry or a laugh, it was creepy, but it was fun too 👌
i love how from the small clip of him, pyramid head is so quiet, which is such a contrast from what people think about him courtesy of dbd.  not a complaint about dbd, it’s just so different and i love it
Silent hill 2 was such a great game.
I can hear xbots crying
hasta me dieron escalofríos de la emoción
"You see it too? For me... it's always like this."  I don't think I'm ready to go through that again.
Leon looks weird...
the best silent hill
Does this mean p.t will be available again
Cute
20 years of waiting but the day has come. Worth every single second of it
Wow! Anticipate!
Can't wait for Konami to charge me $5 to save and $20 for each ending
Meu Deus, mal vejo a hora de lançarem esse jogo, finalmente lembraram de Silent Hill!
We were waiting for the fog to go away...now we can finally see that old town
I remember playing this game on ps1 ages ago
It's a great time to be a Silent Hill fan 👍
I never played it before , can't wait for the release !
Tears flow at 34, a game that is forever in the heart.
Não vejo a hora de lançar, estou esperando faz mais de 20 anos, amo muito esse jogo e por favor façam nem que seja legendado em pt-br!!!!
Wait, I thought Konami had abandoned Silent Hill to pachinko machines?
Where is Norman reedus (deryl)
We want silent hill 3
We want Silent hill origins
Leon Kennedy in Silent hill
When ?
BERTAHUN² NUNGGUIN INI AAAAAA GILAAA SENENG BGTTTT
WHAT ABOUT THE METAL GEAR SOLID COLLECTION
Лучшее, что KONAMI когда либо делало за последние несколько лет
Their are 2 more games coming out called Silent Hill F That has nothing to do with the USA and Silent Hill Town Fall....If this remake is only for the PS5 then I cant play it. I have a PS4
so this means the chance of mgs coming back isnt too slim?!
freaking cant wait for the original to be remade!! Holy smokes!
Leon looks old
Silent hill on psp was my childhood’s adrenaline riser
👎I prefer the original.
I still have PT on my ps4 😊 finally it’s real
I guess it's one of them games which induce us to fall in love with its protagonist
i'll just watch the speedrun ._.
Need dino crysys
James is the original dilf.
can't wait for this
What I would have liked is the Guillermo del Toro Silent Hill game.
Perfect 👌
I just hope THEME OF LAURA gets a Comeback!!!
Sorry I am no longer brave enough to do this. time to pass this on to the next generation.
finally a game to heal on 😩
and how about silent hill 1 remake for ps5?
Why they made 2 how bout 1
I just wanna see the pizza in HD
took them long enough.  let those guys know to not lose the source code to their own game this time around
Think they could have done a better job a recreating James face, to be honest doesnt look like it was the goal at all, they should gone for that
SILENT HILL ORIGINS REMAKE TO PS5
I don't know if Sony is realizing the money that can be made from recreating the hit games of the 90s, 00s
iss a masterpiece
I would buy a PS5 to play this. The original creeped me out so much as a kid
Finally Konami found the software
If they remake Silent hill 4 it would be great :D
Not a fan of blooper team.... like at all. But still hoping for the best
Hhgu
Well if your gonna go out...might as well go out swinging i suppose
I just have to say, hope them do it well, they need money but... please.... just please.... DONT BE A SHAME!
Kendrick Lamar is the only reason this exists
"I can't tell you to remember me, But I can't bear for you to forget me"...  This line hit me pretty hard as a kid playing the original game...
The tone seems quite different. Hope they keep the original soundtrack, expecially Theme of Laura, Promise and their reprises. Those songs MUST ne in the remake too.
이거 플레이영상 봤는데요. 깜짝깜짝 놀래요 진짜루요. 1인칭 시점에서 보면요. 그리고 짜장면, 짬뽕, 탕수육 그런거 다 현지화 된거잖아요. 원래 중국음식이라고는 하는데요. 저는 중국 좋아해요. 무섭다는거하고 중화요리하고 무슨 상관인데? 강시 이렇게 뿅뿅 튀잖아요. 예의 바르구요. 제가 한 2년정도인가 동네사람들한테 인사만 하고 다닌 적이 있었거든요. 요새는 그렇게 까지는 안하는데요.
Can't stop watching this
I've never played the original but will definitely be looking forward to this
Is that cockroach in the beginning a cheeky reference to PT?
Why only for playstation??? You guys see only the money
about time
i never thought i'd see the day. man what a time to be alive
Still waiting for silent hill P.T.
Inb4 oof
Oleyyyyyyy ağlicammmmmmmmmm 🥺🥺🥺
Release date?
Neva in my life had I thought I'd see Pyramid Head in SH2 in HD
Silent hill then: looking his lost daughter  Silent hill now: looking his lost wife
Thanks for not showing any gameplay
RIP to our fellow brethren who passed away without knowing this will be remastered
There was a hole here, now its gone.
Leon is that you?
As an OG I am definitely hyped for this. The emotions were present in the original but not visually matched due to the limitations. The way Luke's James says Mary's name when meeting Maria is perfectly incredulous. I can't wait ❤️
"some fear death.....others prey for it"
Muchos chavitos generación 2000 para acá no jugaron este pedo en el ps1. La mejor consola -un verguerísimo de juegos y SH era de los mejores; top 10 facil.
James looks like Harry Mason
Finally Sony told em about the millions of times Silent Hill was searched for in the PS store, most of them was me btw
Leon S. Kennedy lookin' rough. 😂😂😂😂😂
o clásico ou melhor super clásico
best part of this trailer is  PS5 exclusive...   *reads fine print*   PC after 12 months.  lol
It's so beautiful 😭 why not both consoles 😒 konomi  is Xbox owners want it to 😡
Horror movies don't faze me but silent hill for ps2 definitely had the on the edge of ur seat feeling what a game this just looks brilliant
Well the trailer already completely misses the tone of the original game so my hopes are pretty low.
What a time to be alive for a 90s born kid.
Куплинов не пропусти пожалуйста
Куплинов не пропусти пожалуйста
made by out source company again.........
Words can’t express how happy I am for Konami to remake this horror classic, arguably to best ever to shine once again on PS5!! Thank you Konami….
Looks great
I honestly would prefer a Silent Hill 1 remake, as the game has aged worse than Silent Hill 2, but I guess Silent Hill 2 is more popular.
He looks like William Brinkin from Resident Evil 2
Pfffff this is gonna be a better can't wait. Ouuuuu weeeeee.
The animations look kinda jank This didn't need a remake. I wish they'd at least give it a different title (SH2 Remake or something).
Mmmmm... aún NO le veo nada Genial en sí He. NO hagan mas de lo mismo si no es que le añaden muchisimas cosas nuevas y buenas. porfavor si no ya dejen en paz a los juegos de antaño. a menos que haya mucha pero mucha más interactividad en el medio ambiente y en relación a que salgan muchas mas cosas en todas las areas.  que no sea un escenario vacio como loes mi corazon!!!!!!
It'll be hard to not miss James' original voice actor.
It's back.
It doesn't look too bad tbh
Bruh my friend said it looked like silent hill outside and i watched the movie so I’d figure I’d look it up and what do I find? My next hame
We want SH1 remaster!
И если Konami это читают, то хочу обратиться к ним. Не забрасывайте разработку этой игры. Ведь это шедевр !
I hope it's not overly hard and frustrating like homecoming
I want to play this game so bad ! 👀
My big hope for this remake that will probably not happen is for it to be a Rebuild of Evangelion/FF7R situation. IE, secretly a sequel to the original Silent Hill 2. Imagine how cool that would be.
AMAZING TAKE ALL MY MONEY
Can’t wait to see the dog ending in HD
I'm waiting for this I love this game  💯❤
Capcom has left the chat
exclusivo??
Ofcourse I hate cockroaches.
cant wait for them to remaster the dog ending
Сайлен хилл не выйдет новости сказали
My only question is. Is it the original voice actors? James sounds too manly
What does Gennady Golovkin do in Silent Hill?
I’m gonna get a ps5 just for this
I’m gonna cry
Op 😍🥰🥰🥰🥰
😘😘🥰🥰🥰🥰😍
Por fin llego un nuevo título de esta franquicia pero solo es exclusivo para sony no me quedare atras tengo un empleo hornado, y ahorraré para la ps5
Pagan Min aged)))))
as much as I love Silent Hill 2, can we stop getting reboots of remasters of remakes of rehashes? can we have something new?
in my restless dreams i see that town silent hill 🥹🤍
My dreams have come true
0 atmosphere. Why would you re-make a horror game where everything is so well-lit?
Konami finally coming to their senses
They started caring about SH again
We want P.T. DAMMIT!!!
Silent Hill 01 was WAAAY CREEPIER....
They must keep the music from the original, it’s iconic.
How about a new silent hill instead of living of old hits Konami? I though pachinko would sustain you
How is it that something that is supposedly has updated graphics looks worse than the original version?
WOW!
I hope they release it on PC i never had the chance to try a silent hill game.
I bought a ps2 silent hill special 2 disk set. I didn't know what gem I own now
James sounds too badass
Six words: "Shut up and take my money!"
The worst part of the franchise by far
espero que solo sea un teaser, le falta un poco de suciedad y sangre, se ve todo muy limpió
Espero que dessa vez não cancelem como foi em 2014 com PT.
this looks so cheesy compared to the original
Nice hat.
1:31🥵🥵🥵
cant wait for this. sh2 is my fave coz of atmosphere and soundtrack!
In my restless dreams I see that town.....
Finally after all that time of waiting we get four games. 👍👍👍👍
release date?
Don't play any silent hill games in the dark cause you'll ended up sleeping with a night light. The struggle is real.
Im just glad this is not being directed by kojima
2 weeks ago
Wow, what a pleasent surprise from Konami
So a remake of a game already made? Boring
I hope its back to the japanese creators now because the americans just fked up the franchise. Looks great but who knows the repute is infamous when japan stoped developing it.
As a silent hill fan where is the gore?!?!💔💔💔
❤
konami remaking sh2, hah, miracle
i can't help but feel a little underwhelmed by the graphics in this ad. Not sure why but it feels to have an almost cartoonish approach to the art which feels as though it's slightly taking away from the original games dark atmosphere.
Looking forward to a defeated Maria boss saying "James" repeatedly in an eerie fashion.
Creature Design: Masahiro Ito Music: Akira Yamaoka This is all that matters to me
Omay gad esto va ser epico PAPUS!
They should make James look the same as in SH2 expect ofc better graphics. Other than that I like it.
FuckKonami
GUYS OUR DREAM IS FINALLY COME TRUE….LONG WAITED GAME ❤❤❤
Мери !
Meh
昔の日本の地方が舞台と聞く。主人公は金髪なんだね。昔の日本なら外国人に対してまだ偏見があったと思う。どれだけ排他的な表現があるのかな？日本のじっとり湿ったホラーも表現されてるといいなあ。これが「サイレン」ではなく「サイレントヒル」だなんて、嬉しいやら驚きやら！✨  I hear it is set in a rural area of old Japan. So the main character is a foreigner. I think in old Japan there was still prejudice against foreigners. I wonder how much exclusivity is expressed in the game? I hope the slowly approaching Japanese atmosphere of horror is well represented. I'm happy and surprised that this is "Silent Hill" and not "Siren"! ✨
That music sure takes me back.  I'm close to crying tears of joy.
To be honest, I'm both scared and curious about this remake of SH2. The graphics look almost to realistic.
I so don’t see the point of this. I hate the look of it. It’s totally lost the unique style of the original’s aesthetic and also it’s fine by Bloober Team which is a company that deserves basically no respect.
Its just the original game with better graphics. I cannot wait to play this bro.
😊👌🏻
at least it isn't a pachinko machine
<3
I never played this game so it's gonna be like a brand new game for me like re 2 remake
La mera verdad solo m gustaron el primero y el segundo ahhh y también el último del play 3 down no me acuerdo
su ps4 proprio no è? 😢😢😢😢
Silent hill 1 is the one who deserves a remake.. it is the one who's the most similar to the 2006 film.. it has midwitch elementary school which is the scariest place
Wen Steam?
James has always been discount Leon Kennedy.
Welcome to Silent Hill.We've been waiting for you.
I truly hope Akira Yamaoka kept to the same ambient sounds and creepy music. I'd love a mix of the old and new, of course. Akira has been one of my music composing inspirations, for sure. The way a simple sound can turn the spine to ice isn't as easy at it seems. To me, in my opinion, he's one (if not THE) best composers of erie sounds that will seep into your brain and take you where you never would want to go.
사일런트힐로 ps2를 알게 됐고 그로인해 내 삶의 정체성도 변화됐다 이 시나리오와 게임은 예술과 나의 가치관을 변화시켰다 또한 ost를 제작한 akira akirayamaoka를 존경한다 그의 탁월한 감각과 아티스트의 충분한 자질에 존경과 감사함을... 나의 인생에 영감을 준 당신에게
Why don't they release it on the ps4
honestly i thought this day would never come i'v been replaying the original games for over 10 years  i don"t even care if its going to be a bad remake im just happy silent hill is finally coming back
Please make it rigth, my heart will not resist another dissapoiment
They should make the main player after Leonardo Dicaprio
SHIZUOKA（静岡）：Japanese translation of Silent Hill (as a joke of course)
Been playing Silent Hill for 23 years. Seeing this releases the demons Konami caused with it's long absence. Thank you for killing them.
Will buy ps5 for this alone.. i cant believe it.
Sh 1 would be even better
I'm already looking forward to the release
I'm a fan of horror games.... this silent hill franchise is hard to disappoint
Y'all remember Hideo Kojima
un sueño echo realidad, ver esta saga de vuelta a la vida. ❤️
I am not quite sure this makes up for the loss of Silent Hills.
What song is that sounds like from the 70's
la mano llena de leche
Уберите руки от святого !
Miles apsher outlast
Well well well, look who came crawling back after getting rid of most of the videogame division and focusing on pachinko machines and gambling.
Опять плакать придётся при прохождении
когда я играл в первый сайлент хилл мне было 12-13 лет сейчас мне 35
No dubbing or subtitles in Portuguese PT BR ? I don't pay for it.
The PS2 still looks much better
i want to see this again and again and again
There were two  songs that i loved in the soundtracks and in the game itself those were Promise and The Reverse Will
In my restless dreams I see that game Silent Hill 1, the game they seem to have forgotten about
[хрень
Bro this looks sick af why are people hating on it!?
Music?
PT PT PT PT PT PT PT
I want this game to be released on the PS4 as well!
james is so…🤭🤭
0:38 Jeremy Fragrance's daily morning routine :D
If it aint by kojima i dont want it
Hmm. I really like the last melody when James is walking on the pier. Does anyone know if it is part of a longer musical piece and what is its name?
Can't wait to meet the dog in ps5 graphics
Too bad that they didn't preserve the skin pale looking of james sunderland and also his late 90's attire, I'm missing the black leather boots and the baggy cargo jacket.
Bloober shows a lot of promise, but still doesn't give me assured confidence in this installment.
AYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I never got to play any of the Silent Hill games (except a little bit of Homecoming) but I’m beyond pumped for this. My only question is, wasn’t Pyramid Head a lot taller? I don’t know how he was in the games but he’s a giant in the movie.
✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
This game haunts my childhood everytime I play it but now as an 17 year old teenager I hope I can play it without sleep problems
Terry B And Blue Mary
Просто охуенно!!!
Pizzagate?
this cant be real … IM DREAMING !!!
wow! so exiting! but I am disappointed that Konami skipped Silent Hil 1 remake. graphic and sights are great but I am not fond of main character so far.
They really have forgotten the PS4 just like that, Not anybody can afford The ps5..
didnt they already remake silent hill 2 and add a ufo ending.
im still waiting silent hills
if this came back, i think i can have some hope for a splatterhouse and clock tower remake
Ahhh... aquelas enfermeiras...
Is this ps exclusive??
This game will be in 30fps or in 32...21fps until I get it in 60...58fps on ps6?
Silent Hill 2 es como un poema echo videojuego y ningún recalentado por más imagen que tenga podrá cambiar la primera experiencia
Maybe next time Konami will make a Yu Gi Oh game for PS5...
I am gonna buy PS5 just to play this game sooner than later.
I'll disappoint you, it's impossible to capture the vibe of the original.
I'll wait for PC/Xbox.
now bring back p.t haha
Is this for real?
Ya gotta wait what medal gear is going to look like 🥹
i’m very glad ethan looks like an “every man” not chiseled and perfect but a little chubby and with scars and a five oclock shadow
Amo la cucaracha del P. T.
What a great time to be alive .. if your a gamer , otherwise not so much ..
James better still be devoid of all character
Not for PS4?...😮‍💨
They should've made a remake of the PS1 one...pretty sure SH2 is in the HD collection,PS2 games are fine as they are if the gameplay isn't outdated as well.
Trailer is way too epic for this kind of game
Silent Hill взяла пример с Resident Evil и решила делать ремейки на свои самые удачные игры))
LETS GOOO
Ta. Będą sprzedawać odgrzewany kotlet po 350pln.
Silent Hill 2 back in 2001 was one of the best horror games rivaling Resident Evil franchise!
this caracter like leon s kennedy 😅
I wonder if Castlevania will get another game next.
Looks like it will be a really gorgeous remake but I honestly still prefer the OG James with his voice actor...
The bloober team did an amazing job on The Medium. Im so glad they got hired for this
SH2 will be avaible to ps4 too?
Wow the most creepy game ever.     I cant wait to play this
They went and did it, the lunatics. Brilliant
Why are they starting with 2 and not 1?
How about a remaster of s.h.2
This means we might be blessed with a Metal Gear solid 1 or 3 remake for ps5 if this remake of Silent Hill 2 is a success!!
I can't get enough of this trailer 🥺
Unreal engine huh.
I'm very excited for this, silent hill does everything right as far immersing you into it's ambiance, the music alone calls me back into the fog. Finally!
Gráfico de ps2
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
RES 4 Y DESPUES SILLENT HILL , SE VIENE LO BUENO EL PROX AÑO
They have to, they lost metal gear
OHMYGOD YESSS
Silent Hill is the Best❣👻
Yes please
공포를 만들랬더니, 스토리중심의 어드벤처를 만들어놓은것 같은 느낌이...
im so happy!!
you must repair 5 generators .  the gates  will be able to open . And you can survive from pyramid head
コジプロじゃなくてコンマイから...?
тупой момент с ключем🤣
I'm pushing 40 now and gaming has taken a backseat to a full time job, kids, and other responsibilities. I've yet to buy a PS5 because I just haven't felt the need to get one. That being said, this trailer has just pushed me in that direction. I can't remember the last time I watched a trailer with a smile on my face the whole time. Day one purchase!!
A dream come true
I hope Rockstar to see this and learn how it has to be done.
We need a original silent hill remake aswell..
Bring back MGS FFS & F*k Konami.
Boring trailer.
5 million views in 13 days! So excited for this.
Unreal Engine is looking crazy on silent hill🔥🔥🔥🔥
where Silent Hill 1 remake
No WAY! One of the best games ever. SUPER excited for this.
The graphics and atmosphere and nostalgia is so high. I want more info about the game like how will it be changed/adapted, how the gameplay will be, will they add new stories or new puzzles, or anything. I want more info now!!
why james is asian ?
Is it weird to say that James looks more haggard, worn out and older in this? I thought James was in his mid 30s but here, he looks like in his 40s.
Is it just me or i feel like those dialogues that they put in is for kojima 😂"i know why i need you but its all over now, i dont need you anymore"
Konami please bring Contra (same like Call of Duty Series)
I clapped when I saw pyramid face
It is a d*** shame the way they have neglected Silent Hill and and How incredible it is. This looks amazing and brought tears to my eyes remember aint remembering playing this when I was younger. ❤
Can’t wait
Now this has me excited. Cautiously optimistic.
PLEASE COME TO PC!!
Only ps5 fail
does the start of it in the mirror reminds of Cyber-punk to anyone else ???
I've been lost, in silent hill. My whole life. ♥️
now i hope silent hills wil come out
I played this so Many times
💪🏻 5 000 000 views ✓ [ Proud of KONAMI ] especially when being hated by everyone just like those fools 🖕🏻 claiming that Hideo Kojima is Silent Hill's mentor and creator. Silent Hill 2 remake (or any upcoming KONAMI's franchise) should be PS5 Console Exclusive for 4 years minimum instead of 1 because of people of this kind.
Wow James here reminds me of George Stobbart from the Broken Sword series.
처음에 나오는 ㅂ선생님이 제일 무서우니까요.....
So this is not a Silent hill pachinko machine remake? Sorry but I just lost all interest.
Always remember your roots
Does anyone think the PS5 will ever get new games? 🤔
Remastered ?
It's about time for Konami to do a remake of this masterpiece! Let's hope Bloober team do well and succeed because the game deserves it! Welcome back Silent Hill ❤️
Bloober team is really grew up
take my money!
silent hill without kojima? idk man...
Gracias Konami🖒
El rostro se ve feo
silent hill😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
brf ถูกใจสิ่งนี้
song @2:33 anyone please ?
Wow! i cant wait to play!
Soooo did they remake the entire game or just the cinematic parts?
we want underground 2 remake
Could of sworn this was just a fever dream.... A shared one at that
it's great but did we really need a remake of the silent hill 2? original game is still playable and already great, over the shoulder camera, particle effects, and HD graphics made this like a regular game.
Remake has no soul and style the original had. Weak.
静　岡　県　2
I hate the subtle nod to PT in the beginning after they scrapped it and did Kojima dirty... That being said can't wait for this remake!!
why did he turn into dream
just piss5 soystation i guess
I cannot wait for pyramid head to come in and send him to the cage of torment
Woww 😲
Why start with 2 and not 1? It's Pyra- It's Pyramid Head isn't it?
Sad
scary
Woooooooooow
Resident evi fans has some compitition
Trailer horrível, é novela ou jogo de terror?
Hope they keep the dog ending 😅
Siiiiiiiuuuuuuuuuuuuu
amaziing
Silent Hill ❤
Lol so after the success of Resident Evil, Komani finally decided to piggyback. Why not try Silent Hills? 🤡
I came across this, after in my history of watching certain things Silent Hill related…. I was watching a random video of a guys play through the second one, and I don’t recall even though it was a few minutes ago and my short-term memory is not that great, I don’t recall if he mentioned a Silent Hill 2 remake, or if someone in the comments mentioned the remake of it after coincidentally watching the video I was originally watching, so I heard about this on this video and looking at the label for the video I realized it was only 12 days ago that the original video I caught all of this from somehow, was just that recently and I literally said out loud in a minimal surprise shock factor “there’s a Silent Hill 2 remake coming out?!” 😟  Went to google on my Safari app, and then instead of looking for an article to read about it, I was already recently on YouTube, so I typed in Silent Hill 2, and before I could even start typing in the word comma remake, it was about sixth or seventh down on the list of most recently looked into things, and that’s how I came across this.  I can’t even imagine how much better and creepier the game might actually be, updated with this look. (Smh)
lets hope they respect the town this time
Lets see if Konami can give this a modern standard. I would never pay 80 bucks for a visiual impressive game, but with a 20 years old, outdated gameplay.
Unfortunately ever since Kojima's departure from Konami the world has been robbed from what could've potentially one day have been the best Horror game experience ever. Seeing as Kojima is no way, shape or form affilated with this remake I'm going to pass up on it-
La mia infanzia!!!
C A R A L H O!! FODA!
No way
Bloober team?  Ok, ok there's potential then.
La misma grafica de xbox one y ps4 xd
is that Leon Kennedy from resident evil? or Jaime Lannister from Games of Throne?
This is so disrespectful.....
textures are waaaay too sharp
I cant wait for this
wow konami Silent Hil 2 thise is epic engine
سايلنت هيل ❤️💔
So Silent Hill is just never getting remade, then.
Glad to see SH getting some attention however this is so unnecessary? The original Directors Cut is perfect, they should stop encouraging people to play old or classic games only through a remaster.
So... I can assume they'll cut out the uber suggestive rvpe scenes, get rid of fixed camera angles and give it 'modern' controls?  Two of those three (on top of the grainy voice acting) was the reason it was horrifying?
ну, через пару лет ждём этот "эксклюзив" на ПК👍
Excellent ! Now we're waiting for Half Life 3
Espero que que el soundtrack de cuando James se enfrento a los dos Cabezas de Piramides sea el mismo
Perfeito!
wishlist now! release never!🤣
Alot of people in the comment surprised that konami remembering silent hill. What do you expect? Capcom are making so much money from resident evil remakes.
They better leave in the secret ending
Стиль в дизайне лиц и анимации потерян, лицо Джеймса в зеркале не выражало эмоций в оригинале, и было этим и красиво. Как и остальные персонажи, была какая-то театральность и извращенность в их лицах
Pachinko wasn't working out huh?
o protagonista parece o BRKsEDU kkkkkkkkk
Кто играл тихий холм самую первую часть тот понял жизнь !
👎
Might just have to buy a ps5 now. Best game ever.
와아아아!!!!!!!!!!!!😊
i remember playing silent hill on PS1 holy
ｆなんて無かった。PC版出るなら絶対買います。
Just hope it's not far left and woke.
Leon?
how small is triangle head in this? his whole triangle fit in a doorway, MF must be 4 foot tall under that helmet xD
The piano in the background is a master piece. Absolute excellent!
Amm, yummy - 20 yrs old refreshed dish 😋
There is one machinima clip made in TheSims 2, it is much more atmospheric than this teaser trailer.
Почему именно 2 часть .
It's silent hill so I'm going to buy it regardless but I am feeling hopeful
@老吴
❤❤❤❤❤
This brings tears to my eyes!!! 😭😭😭 I love it
Never forget what they did to PT
Again thank you so much for Capcom who start the remake wave
I really hate Konami so much  but this IP... I can not hate it...
Bring hideo back !!!!
Just bring hideo kojima back already!!!!
Yehhhhhhh
I'm hyped
yolo yolo yooo
I don't mind remakes but I don't think the original should just be left in the dust. They should remaster the original for current consoles for future generations to enjoy. This is the same for other games as well like resident evil 2 I loved the RE2 remake but recently I went back and played the original and I realised that there was so much more content than the remake. The original had the zapping system which was awesome that wasn't included in remake and had a far more fleshed out scenario A/B with completely different scenes and outcomes to each other and let's not forget the RE3 remake that cut half the game. The original should always be available not replaced
naaaa que recuerdos,todavía lo tengo el cd,y ahora me lo descargue en formato digital  espero que hagan lo mismo con el 1,3,4 y el orígenes-  juegaso que se merecía su propio remake
Why so old? :v
Este juego sera increible de eso no tengo la menor duda y como fan antiguio de la saga ya no aguanto las ganas de jugar a esta obra maestra =)
But it’s all ogre now
i love this,but a castlevania sotn remake mmmm
Looks like the graphics belong in 2010
أحسن لعبة في التاريخ 😁❤️
Ofcourse they had to put their stuhty logo on the top corner cuz smhukKONAMI
Wow sony need money soooo much?
Sale justo cuando Baity está de vacaciones :'v
I hope this is goig to be a huge success and we will get mor of Silent Hill soon :D
Es real nooooooo puedo creeerlooooooooo ❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
FucKonami
Finally....❤
Це просто неймовірно!!!! Найкраща гра з серії SH. Ваууууу!! Я не вірю, що такий крутий ремейк вийде. Легендарно.
Be a simple man  will be better
Goosebumps ran from the memories. But there are visual issues. Bust with lighting. Flashlight for decoration and not gameplay. Too light where it used to be dark and creepy. This is a big omission for the perception of this world. And that poppy orange filter. What for? The bluish matte filter was better for the environment! Don't spoil the legend!
What ? For real ? 😮
It doesnt't matter who I am. I'm here for you, James. See? I'm real.
Just like with movies we're seeing another pointless remake of something that still holds up while new IPs are getting shelved by executives with no artistic sensibility... Might still be fun tho
Yes James put that hand into commode once again.
Cannot express enough how overly excited I am about this to the point where I couldn't care over the boredom of my lack of love life at the moment as I'm probably doomed to be lonely as this man looking for the love of his life that he's never gonna find while living with a curse. I've missed SH like crazy for years and now the wait is finally over. Always thought it was better and more unique with so much more potential than Resident evil games, same it didn't get the same amount of love and support. The music captured it's pure essence and melancholy excellently. I remember the last Silent hill game I completed was Origins and I thought it was genius how you can switch into alternate realities by the touch of a mirror from one world to an underworld in order to extend the duration of the game. Games like this truly express our mind states in situations in many ways as human beings.   Silent Hill really did go "Silent" on us for a decade so this is the greatest comeback. All because the Dev fell out with Konami.   This horror franchise also reminds me why I love the fog so much especially since we don't get it that much. These games ain't just for the horror experience but also a personal experience that strangely brings me comfort over some relatable struggles such as isolation, I've always felt out of place and always fallen for the wrong people who would never choose me in real life so you can't be together in this life therefore it takes you to this other weird world where things feel fake because you can't find something real that makes you feel alive but at the same time you feel more comfortable round these monsters than other humans because humans are toxic animals. When you feel lonely as this character you oddly feel like you're not real but exist in a different world spending years of your life trying to feel real, find meaning to life, find the woman of your dreams but you build barriers and obstacles in your mind to prevent you from getting that such as the monsters that represent them in this game. You are also dealing with an issue that most of the population ain't dealing with so you feel like you're the last person on earth and you just suffer in silence
Cypress hill
Will there be a Nintendo Switch version?
Trailer is ambiguous
Когда выйдет игра?
can't wait for this to be cancelled
Three words: Afacc' ro' cazz'
Leon why are you here?
come on randomly watching... and1st the nostalgic feeling (ps1,2,3 time) aand 2nd just and  awesome trailer. goosebumps man how fast time goes
Is this Harry Mason? 😬
❤️
Looks like play station 4 graphics
This will be on PC soon enough.
我的錢包君 已經飢渴難耐 快來吧 ~!!
So is it Konami, or Bloober Team?
"In my restless dreams, I see that town. Silent Hill. You promised me you'd take me there again someday. But you never did.................."
wish i could hear the remake of theme of laura as well
You can just see the absolute sadness and despair on James' face in every scene. A man who's lost it all.
this will be an exclusive game for ps5? i only have pc
I hope they rework pyramid head, maybe the early 00's rendering gave it that charm we all fell in love with but the original was so much more rusty/dirty/broken and filled with holes instead of what looked like a pyramid shaped helmet covered in a brown cloth, worn by a pale imitation of the rotting, flesh shredding monster incarnate pulsated by thick blackened veins Pyramid head is.
Silent Hill 2 2022 Remake Remastered Director's Cut UnCut Second Season Second Episode is now out.
I was hoping they'd remake this game. Guess I'll need to work on earning enough for a PS5.
LET'S GO
How could they put out a teaser trailer of silent hill in which the radio sound is absent?
Why not begin with Silent Hill 1???
Pretty sure I played this game 20 YEARS AGO!  Cheaper to remaster/redo old titles than come up with an original installment.
As if Dante's Inferno had made a leap into modern times with its twisted psychological horror.
No. I refuse to trust this news at all. You don't have the mental capacity to do MGS. Not without Kojima. So anything you do now, is the equivalent of an upside-down kangaroo trying to bounce up and down, and then failing miserably. Its the equivalent of having a game without Ken Walterburg, CEO of Cryzontech 5.
Terrible character design but i await this game!
Alan wake
Pyramid head looks too skinny
NO PC VERSION???
The song in the end. <3
Wait what?! Is this real?! Is it finally happening?? My favorite horror game are back!!
Silent Hill 2 was one of the most atmospheric and creepy games I played back in the day. I remember borrowing the game from my uncle and being super fascinated with the town.
His face is all wrong.
👍
عنصرين
por favor não estrague isso konami
Konami was my favorite company on PS2. and then it was clearly spoiled until it became one currently forgotten by me. the pes, silent hill, metal gear, snatcher etc... classics were the best in their genres without a doubt. I miss something like this now.
1/10 not enough fog... But for real where is all the fog?! It looks more like a most than a deep thick fog...
Not ((
is it made by Konami? it isn't pachinko machine ? what happened with konami ?
PS5 exclusive?
Guys, what if the game release goes bad when it has bugs and glitches just like the GTA Definitive Editon and Cyberpunk?
Who is he ? Harry Mason …?
Now Parasite eve 2!! NOW!!
I loved LOVED this game. But why is he giving me Leon vibes from resident evil? Like what if this was an alternative world for Leon if resident evil never happened😅
MADRE MIA,S LA POLLA...Q HASTA LOS INSECTOS STAN MUY BIEN HECHOS...MOL BÉ KONAMI!!! Y CAPCOM,AL ACECHO CON R.E.8!!!(SHAD...OF...RO...)
They need to bring fatal frame back too!
Editing of this trailer is terrible
Hello I want this for X📦 cuz u are crying for COD but u make this an exclusive that's bad
Sounds like they took the liberty to fk up the soundtrack.
小島抜きで作りやがったｗ ここのコメントで称賛してる人間も含めて馬鹿じゃねえか？
Oh siii
FINALLYYY
Do people really like being scared? Why?
tengan en cuanta esto.... cuando el trailer es largo (ya sea de una pelicula o juego), el mismo termina siendo una reverenda mierrrda inmunda odiada y olvodable. es una ciencia exacta practicamente
Please re launch in india
HOW ABOUT YOU TAKE THE 70 DOLLARS YOU WOULD HAVE SPENT ON THIS GAME GET A PS2 AND PLAY THE ORGINAL  THANK ME LATER!
It’s time for the rebirth of the most unnerving horror game out there! (In my opinion)
Another souless cash grab. 🖕🖕
It seems as though they've changed the dialogue James has when he encounters the 2 pyramid heads killing Maria. I'm honestly a little apprehensive about that because the original was absolutely perfect. I still get goosebumps from watching it. But I'll reserve judgment until I play it. In my opinion it's the most important scene of the game.
I've been watching this trailer for the past 10 days everyday now
So no more ps4 games? Dafaq
Can't wait to meet Pyramid Head again
c'est comme la demo de pt ??
I thought this one was going to be set in japan?
almost looks like ps3 graphics I’m so proud🎉
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
ALL of the music from the original better be in here somehow. If not, then that will be 100% criminal. Specifically, the pizza scene where Alone in the Town is played. That is some killer trip hop, eerie music and I could not accept this part not being included in the remake.
Serinin en güzeliydi o zamanlar translate yok tabi sözlükten çeviriyoduk :)
Nurses nurses nurses nursesss
But why no Silent Hill 1?
PS4????
2:43 VLC media player v2.022 - stealth edition
If it's being made by Bloober it's already ruined.
Anyone know the name of the song that plays during the trailer?
We going home, son
why is his forhead so small
The video game industry is starting to be like Hollywood. Nothing but reboots and sequels
Can’t wait for all Legacy of Kain/ Soul Reaver remakes. For now it is a great step for Konami thinking about fans instead of gamblers.
Go back to Silent Hill? I'm down.
I do wish they kept the original voice actors, there was something about the broken, confused dialogue that made it strangely authentic.
Só acredito vendo ! Eu vendo e não acreditando 😨
Sieht wirklich gut aus ... Aber auf der x-Box wird es natürlich nochmal.viel.besser aussehen
That face
All my life I've only known his name, namely Silent Hill
NO MAMES CREI QUE ERA OTRO TRAILER FANMADE
Kojima?
Amazing!
Man I am popping the O.G. Silent Hill 2 into my Xbox right after work
What I like about Silent Hill is that its just beyond a game- it actually gives you an experience. Its one of the games that I feel deeply connected. Looking forward to experience it.
Best announcement EVER! Best exclusive PlayStation ❗️👍
why hair has no movement?
I’m buying a PS5 FOR this 😮
bruh they just fired kojima and not releasing silent hills but all we got is all this.
YEEEEEESS, the best horror game ever is back, I waiting so many long from this moment😍😍😍😍👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻
Well i guess im buying a ps5🤷🤷🤷
Those zombie nurse are hot 🥵
"In my restless dreams, I see that game, Silent Hill. Konami promised to take us there again someday. But they never did. Well, I am all alone now, waiting and waiting……”
что если не играл в эти игры вообще?
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
The best horror game series ever.
will we see anything like P.T. ever again? 🥺
DELIGHTED ABOUT THIS
Multiverse of Leon S.Kenedy?
Nostalgic

静岡2 小並
I will download this illegally in pc.
wow🤩🥳
Digo sho, esto es real? No me hagan ilusionar como lo hicieron anteriormente para después cancelar. No sean crueles 🥺.
I see this man is a fan of breathing. He does seem to enjoy breathing quite a bit more than your average person.
whats up with the 2012 graphics?
Leon
• NOW... We're 💪🏻 TALKING ✓ • Wishlist added ✓ • 4 400 000 views in 9 days (and STILL counting) ✓ • 🤫 ---> CAPCOM's RE4r & Leon S. GAYnnedy ✓ • Thanks, K🎃NAMI & Bloober Team for bringing Silent 🪳 Hill back ✓ • DON'T forget 🙏🏻 about CASTLEVANIA too 🥺 ✓
PS５を普通に買えるようにしてください。 マイクロソフト最高です。
NOW I have a reason to get a PS5.
Gosh... I was 100% sure it will be BAD... Now I see they do really try, and plenty of hopes is revealled
Al fin Csm
Es un juego o una película los gráficos están de locos
Кал видать, графика ужасная и ни одного страшного момента.
Me compraría una Ps5 solo por esta maravilla! Que manijaaaa LPM.
Not for xbox what
内村光良さんが本編の主人公ってことでいい？
EL REGRESO DEL MEJOR JUEGO DE TERROR DE LOS TIEMPOS
One ☝️ PS4
DAYUM look at them graphics!!
This town is full of pizza, how can you sit there and eat monster?!
James.... You made me happy.
Well, I guess I'll have to buy a PS5.
Looks dumb
Let’s gooo!!!!
Fun fact, Luke Roberts, the guy playing this version of James, is the same guy who played Ser Arthur Dayne in Game of Thrones.
are you town?
$120 later
they really trolled us with that PT looking thumbnail 😭
Very disappointed it's not PT!
to me silent hill 3 was the best
Still waiting for Parasit Eve
So it's Resident Evil Leon.
ya lo jaquie
Release date?
Coming to Xbox pretty soon!
Just a few days before it was announced I was missing silent hill so badly and even added "Theme of Laura" in my Spotify playlist 💕
Wait? This is not a pachinko? smh
a barata no começo me fez pensa: será que vão fazer mesmo ? mais o cancelado foi cancelado mesmo e não vai mudar.
sinceramente sou mais o que foi cancelado
If the trailer is in 60fps, the actual release better be also.
pre order game now
I can't WAIT to see Mr. PiramidHead again :D !  ! ! !  / _ _ \
Teaser trailer ¡Metal Gear 1 plissss!
pls dont be another cyberpunk launch, this trailer gave me ptsd especially the hand rub in front of the mirror. Just like V did before getting clapped by Dex
♥️😭
Who sees Crispin Glover modelled as the man in this game? Looks like him alot.
Que hipocrisia em sony fala que a xbox deixar o cod exclusivo vai te prejudicar e ainda por cima sai comprando exclusividade contudo quanto é jogo.  Isso não é hate são apenas verdades.
aaahh brings back memories....
ugh different voice actor will be an adjustment.  hopefully the soundscape/soundtrack will remain similar.
Is Kendrick Lamar and Kodak Black gonna be in it????
But..... What about Silent Hill 1?
Oh it's you
ЕБАТЬЬЬЬЬЬЬЬЬЬЬЬ
thank you playstation for this ramake 👏👏👏👏
I guess Leon Kennedy took some wrong vacations again
Maannn.. I miss Norman
Is this a remake?
Какое гавно! Где графоний?🤔
What am I doing here at 3am 💀
We want part 1, one is the best
Que juegasoo para ps5💪
They are finally doing remakes?
WHERE IS PYRAMID HEAD'S FACE HOLE FOR HIS LONG FREAKY TOUNGE, GUYS????????? Ya'll forgot, didn't you? 🥺 This is kind of a "no red M&Ms" moment and it makes me a lil sad. Please, give my boy back his weird smelling tounge hole.
you know prices on ebay are going up for any silent hills  now that this will be coming out
обалдеть, а что так можно было?
We still want silent hill PT
It’s him, ITS HIM!
I love all of this, I'm so happy
if the dog is still out there, i'm buying the game
old james chad vs remake virgin
P.t. Is better😢😢😢😢😢😢
What we need is a great silent hill movie to come out
Imagine the remake of Pianissimo epilogue, along many other epic tracks from the original. Best game ever.
Why wasn’t “Theme of Laura” in this trailer? If it doesn’t appear in game THE WHOLE PROJECT IS DISQUALIFIED!
James face when he takes the hangmans rope into his hands…is heartbreaking…
Ps4は？
Please don't turn it into a walking sim
With cutscenes...when we get to the point where we can't distinguish them from reality anymore, will it matter if they are simply shot with live actors?  Wouldn't this save them a ton of time and money?  I can totally see them transitioning from live action, back to the game, lol.
What!? No PC?!
2:30 can't wait to hear full rendition of that piece. it's sound beautiful.
Gorgeous from afar but far from gorgeous.. i was more hype at the thumbnail
Also on ps4
bloodborn PC ?
Still have the original PS1 game ,I've yet to play it lol
Is this real ...
One thing I ever loved about the unique visually character desgin of Silent hill was those Sunken eyes, stiff faces... they matched the psy-themed of the game in my opinion! I wished the new tech never touch that when the time comes! but seems it does! But still wish it to be cool!
Looking forward to them cutting it into pieces and selling as dlc
Gta 6
IS THIS REAL?
@wesleysilvaplayer jogão
Leon from resident evil?
남주인공 얼굴에 pc바람을 맞았나? 옆동네 레온 빰치던 얼굴로 기억하는데... 메어리를 보낸 슬픔의 세월을 표현하기 위해서 겠지만
Trailer says NOTHING 🤡💩
Fogposter be like: mmhmm 😌
James looks like Jeff Dunham`s Walter...
приключения Антона Красовского после рт
Я не смогу в это играть, слишком страшно
why konami remake silent hill 2 instead of silent hill 1 ?
о боже только не говорите что он пошёл как идиот итан из rezident evil за своей бабой бляяяя
Дима куплинов,мы ждём прохождение!
sick remake bro
Ok, NOW I'm getting a PS5.
❤
Please, please don't let this be fake.  Please!
와 사이런트힐 다시나온다니 가슴이 웅장해진디
🖤🖤🖤
Finally
I hope there's a setting to add a film grain overlay
I hope I'm not being greedy, I already want a Silent Hill 1 remake even before this remake come out. XD
what about silent hill 1 coming back too?
I deadass thought Konami was allergic to money, with the way it's been behaving.
W. And I beat the original game on Ps2 just now.
Love the indent on his finger where you can see the wedding ring is missing.
huy que rico
My favourite game of all time! I hope it’s decent
O mundo dos games, nos últimos anos, resumiu-se a: remake, remaster, battle arena. Tá faltando criatividade por aí 🙄
the hill is silent.
🥱😴
I'm not sure why James looks more like Pagan Min now but other than that this looks amazing. Pretty disappointed that it's apparently a PS5 exclusive though. I'd love to play a true remake of one of my favorite games of all time but I'm not buying a whole new system just to do it.
zzzzzzzzzz
Amazing!!!
Wooow konami is back... From pachinko 😂
In my restless dreams…I see that remake….silent Hill
Jamie is here and i love him
This maybe a stupid question but is this coming out on the xbox
He look so 💩 !!!
I'm going to play but I expect amazing voice acting, amazing music and truly the best experience just to top a old PS2 game, if you guys aren't going to get it don't even try
Am I the only one who thinks he looks like Leon from Resident Evil?
This game BETTER have tank controls
Wow Leon looks so real!!
This really made my day. Cast of characters were great. This gives me all the feels just like Demons Souls remake.
why couldnt we get a silent hill 1 remake??
I never thought this was possible.
IT CAN'T BE, I LOVED THIS GAME AS A CHILD
Welps, now I just need to be able to find a PS5
I think we wished for a new one, but this is still huge news that Konami still cares about Silent Hill
👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
This looks stunning!
懐かしい！ そしてリメイク嬉しい！ けど個人的には顔は前の方が好み
Love the emotion you can see in his face
Tem que sair pra PS4
I’ve been waiting for this moment, finally Konami and Playstation remember Silent Hill, i’m so glad now babyyyyy!!!!!!!!
Nope. I still don't understand it.
Hit like so Pewdepie will be voluntarily forced to play this game.
meu ps4 queimou kkkkk ai vejo esse trailler agora kkkk cheguei ficar triste
Please make a PS4 port!
hehe
That thing with triangle head haunted my childhood
So far it looks like it's gonna be a disgrace.
i hope you can still get the dog ending
BIG Golden-Era-of-gaming feelings with this trailer. Let's go PS!
Compra certa
Quero a data
Continuo aqui em Silent hill
Xbox Series x  !
if there is no Doge ending then I don't want it.
Ну наконец-то, дождались!
they remake 2 but how about 1 ?
Кодзима Гений
My life
Avere la ps5 solo per questo gioco.
Love this game but this trailer doesn’t do it justice. It’s very bland
Is it the original trailer or fan one?
wow wow wow
Kinda has a different vibe. We'll see how this goes...
Maria sounds a million times better than Mary. I hope they correct it :v
Dude!! That’s all im going to say
yassification of the silent hill— chile
Lets just hope Konami doesn't mess that up
if you listen carefully you can hear three farts in this trailer :3
Not available for PS4? :(
Where's silent hills
WOW THATS AWESOME
Cant wait for the dog ending in 8K HD
need!
Gracias señor por permitirme vivir esto
This will be a masterpiece <3... Already looks so mindblowing 😍. I'm SO HAPPY that Silent Hill is returning!
Hauntingly spectacular, the best horror game and movie.
This is depressing
The roach shot reminded me of the pt.
Finally 😌
どうせ、マルチなんだろ(￣▽￣;) だったらＰＳ５いらん
Ну херь блять
Rather than making such remake work on P.T. Beach.
Looks promising. Faithful to the original
Eu sou estudante de psicologia. Issp nao quer duzer nada. James começa o jogo delirando com ilusoes e nao triste.  Porque a tristeza só  vem no final. No comeco ele esta curiospe esperancoso com a imagem.da moribunda e da carta na cabecca E no fundo do seu olhar ha  loucura Nao jpgam na nossa cara que ele é maluco logp no comeco. Se vcs nao percebem isso o problema esta em voces. Voces nao conhecem a ordem exata das emocies e como elas se mascaram num  transtorno mental. A questao nao é que no jogo original nao havia expressoes. Havia sim. A questao é que nesse essas expressoes sao exageradas e  fora daordem e do contexto do enredo e da realidade psiquiatrica. Nao é nem preciso terminar o game pra descobrir nada nem se entristecer Todo o misterio cai por terra com a cara de tapado do "novo" James😴😴😴e olha que eu tenho essa cara de tapado tb Os estadunidenses nao tem medo de ser criticos. Por que eu tenho que fingir que nao vi coisas erradas ali??? Um monte de  coisa desnecessaria. Pra que entristecer tanto a cara do personagem se o inicio ele transparece curiosidade e esperanca e delirio?? E só no fim eleé avassalado com o fato. E a cena do banheiro e a vista da cidade. Nao chega nem perto da original poligonada. Custava tirar toda a luz e por mais neblina? Por isso eu detesto essa nova geracao de consoles desde o Play 4.  Eles querem parecer hiperrealistas e nisso tudo fica evidente demais. Sempre a essencia do terror será o misterio e o desconhecimento. Trevas!!? Esse é só um exemplo do porquê de remake nunca prestar. O mesmo aconteceu com os remakes de RE ,,, os caras na maior cara de pau para economizar cortaram cenarios e botaram zzumbis presos na porta..Por que nao esccureceram as laterais das paredes??? Pelo menos isso teria efeito melhore gastariam até menos. A ideia era ficar mais assustador? Porque se nao for pra isso nao ha razao nenhuma pra fazer. Não chegou nem perto de empatar com o original. Entao é algo desnecessario...como tendem a ser remakes. Deixar de investir num jogo novo -- especialmente tendo o Silent Hills em mente --, e havendo tanta possibilidade de historias exploraveis, é indicio de incompetencia, falta de criatividade, preguiça, sem-vergonhice e malandragem  querendo dinheiro fácil com essa desculpa esfarrapada de que "é para novas geracoes". Quem quer conhecer, joga o original. E nao uma copia barata. Só néscios sem minima inteligencia, visao critica e controle emocioinal compram esse marketing mentiroso (redundante eu sei). Eu nao ligo se nao houver mais jogo algum. Ja me acostumei. Melhor do que essa industria do entretenimento falida dos EUA e Japao sujar a imagem de mais uma série de jogos, como já fizeram com o RE e todos os filmes. Não é possivel que só eu esteja me sentindo assim. Mimizento é  o pai. Essa palavra geralmennte é proferida por analfabetos sem capacidade ccognitiva, cconhecimentos e argumentos para refutar o que as pessoas levantam nas críticas. Prefirirei os originais sempre. Remake é sempre um modo de estragar filmes e games bons em si e por si mesmos. E há tanta possibilidade de exploração artística: um estadunidense com ascendência indigena porém xenofóbico, uma mulher pobre que abortou, um homem preto que matou um irmão racista, uma moça lésbica que se suicidou... são tantas possibilidades de enredo cativantes que o fato de a industria gamer se manter euro-cis-heteronormativa (conservadora e egoísta) só faz me irritar. 🎃🎭😪💤 Mas ou é remake ou é a mesma repeticao de historia: o cidadao medio branco hetero de classe media de um pais desenvolvido cujo unico trauma e sofrimento na vida é ter perdido alguem. O mais proximo de quebrar esse estereotipo repetido e insuportavel foi Walter Sullivan em SH4 e moça abusada pelo pai em SH2. Mas se fizer qualquer coiisa fora do padraozinho de ode à propria imagem do padrao, os tsis gamers que um.dia foram sinonimo de inteligencia e universalidade começam a se vitimizar e fazer mimimi enquanto acusam pessoas de minorias de fazerem exatamente o que eles fazem. Mas vejam só... por isso a industria obsoletou e faliu. 😅
Wasn das für ne gequirlte scheiße
Where is silent hill 1 remake?
I can tell this is gonna be great, the animation is flawless. Voice acting is on point. This is one of my favorite silent hills of all time. Akira yamaokas music is just amazing
Ok, but what about pt?
Be nice if they finish the PT game
Looks nice graphically, but I have zero faith in Bloober Team.
this was a great game like resident evil
Can't wait to play this game in 5 years when I can eventually afford a ps5. Definitely will be watching gameplay online when it comes out though, so freaking sick.
Keep Kojima away from this...lol
на 2.12 щелкун?
Foi só eu ou mais alguém ficou esperando a sirene tocar igual ao filme?
Legendary game and music in remake plus in Vr it's be amazing for old school fans
Nah I'm broke
Need it in vr
Fantastico,pero l’avevo immaginato quando qualche settimana fa hanno annunciato un nuovo SH . Non vedo l’ora se solo una ps5 fosse reperibile
I played the original 😎
💜💜💜
My tears are gone now. So happy about silent hill the best U.u
Bem que deveria vim pro PS4 tbm, assim como o RE 4 veio
Sometimes you forget just how incredible PlayStation’s exclusives are. I can’t wait to relive my childhood trauma in beautiful quality.
I can’t wait please don’t forget to remake silent hill homecoming 3 and the room original and shattered memory
Ps1 ve ilkokul yıllarım geldi aklıma. Hey gidi...
@miawaug
They've clearly already missed the point of James' character completely from the trailer, very nice. Bloober team has never been renowned for their subtlety but this is impressive.
Can play in ps4 by any chance?
plz 2:30 song piano give me info
yes! yes! YES! FINALY!
Wow the voice acting is so terrible compared to the original... this looks so... unfortunate.
Absolutly Wow ! I hope the Original Soundtrack is again in the Remake. Thats was an Important Part of the hole atmosphare of the Game. 😍
Yet another reason not to buy a xbox instead of a playstation.
...And PS4???
i want to see a forbidden siren 1 and 2 and fatal frame franchise remake
А вас не смущает, что он нихуя не похож?
I had a hunch they would and eventually it's coming soon
Why was he wearing his ring on the wrong hand..?  In the opening mirror scene you can see a faded line on the skin of his ring finger, but it is on his right hand, not his left.
can't wait i love silent hill
YEEEES YEEEEES YEEEEEEES
Ps2 imortalv❤️
Хуйня якась
Жуть !!!!
Will it come for PC later? I want to see Silent Hill on steam if it comes..🙂
Охуительно
This is a really amazing memory😭
えっ！？！？れ！！、！
give me silent hill 3 remake too
We need P.T.
Silent hill origins remake?
Un gran clásico de juegos, que nunca lograron engancharme; pero no niego que es una saga bien hecha.
Ебать охуенная игра
Why is this teaser so beautiful? The visuals, the color grading, the background music, character graphics and everything else. It's so gorgeous yet so eerie.
Старые, полюбившиеся всем лица, видимо, какая-то ебучая японская религия не позволяет сделать. Как и всегда все после пластики, сука.
finally! 🔥🔥
I still don’t have a ps5, but I really REALLY want to play this
The most unnecesarry remake ever. These poles have never done a scary game ever.
Are there even zombies in this game ?
For PS4?
There was a Silent Hill shaped hole in my heart... It's gone now.
Pleaaaaassssseee do your best. We can wait for years. But not forever. SH2 is legendary game.
Shame it's only for ps5
When song gets SE to remaster Final Fantasy X for next gen Ill specifically buy a PS5
FINALLY OMFG!!!!
👎🏼👎🏼more like “Simpish Hill 2” 👎🏼👎🏼
Can't wait to see shiba inu in silent hill 2 remake
video games made by Japanese creators are fantastic! Eldenring biohazard monsterhunter etc
KONAMI saw the success of the RESIDENT EVIL remakes and was like, "LET'S GET THIS MONEY!"😂   Although to be honest, the new shiny graphics seem to take away some of the dread of the original. The fog doesn't seem as claustrophobic as before.
What took you so long Konami?  We became so old, yet we never have stopped waiting.
ضيفوها PS4
playing this game is more horrific than watching any other horror movie out there :p
The improved graphics really made James seem older than I thot he was
The actor looks like xQc 😂
is akira yamaoka the music composer?
will this come out on pc?
Ps 4 ....
is this also compatible for pachinko machine?
After resident evil siries remake success by capcom.. now Konami want to do silent hill.. I think..
Woooooohoooo!
There was a hole here, it's in Henry Townshend's bathroom now.
cant wait to play this
Best horror game, but the real question is will silent hill pt finally be made?
hol’up , wait a min , sumn aint right
I want all my chillhood games to be remake
Graphis are UNREAL!
Imagine playing this on a ps5
Siiii al fin, un Silent Hill, y el mejor de todos
sou mais "horror em marica hills"
Leon is that u ?
Let's be real silent hill 1 should deserve a remake way before sh2
the fake fans will be brutal on this one................... already have to deal with resi 4 fake fans...................... and now this.........................................
マジのやつきたー!!
Silent Hill 3 is more scary
NOW I NEED P.T TO CONTINUE
I remember the PT project of Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro with the participation of Norman Reedus, what I would like to see, and not these remakes. alas, the project did not
Can someone explain whats the difference with sh2 and shf?
Oooweee
Metal gear solid 1
Bro we waited more than a decade, I thought this was never going to happen (mhmmm Konami)
HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHHAHA ATUMALACA BRENO JORGE
Where's the original music? If it doesn't come with the original music, I'm not playing.
Моя любовь ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ это должен быть крутой ремейк
I rather just watch a professional play the whole game then me just playing it lol😂
i wish they upload this to steam, i want to play this in PC
I miss the giant slow turning fan from original trailer
Finally...I remember playing SH 1&2 back in the days...rebooting the game will be epic...
The best game, for ny life
Eu amo essa atmosfera pesada de silent hill.
I watch this everyday to make sure it's real!!!
se não tiver fan dub eu nem jogo.... sheeeerouuu
Pyramid head is so hot.
He is the father of Leon Scott Kennedy from resident evil.
Ufff con una enfermera así
Finally a actual remake and not a pinball game
Ммммм хуета
Yessssss
2:20 😂
All silent hills video games are garbage
Really not sure about this, seems unnecessary. Would've preferred new competent PC ports of 1-3.
I finished all the original silent hill 2 back to look carefully at the trailer.
What I really want is MGS3
Silent Hill fog is coming back! For all fog fans, check out a band called mgła, you may like it
great game is coming! but why old Leon is here?😂
Konami, Akira  we Lowe you more ❤ thanks you for your work!
i've waited for this day for so long :')
This scene where James washes his hands and them looks into a mirror has same vibe as a scene from Cyberpunk 2077 trailer, where V was doing the same things in the motel.
So are we ever going to get Silent Hills, because that was an amazing trailer...
내 추억에 먹칠하지마.
my childhood trauma is back 😭😵😵‍💫
eu quero ver o final nada a ver! quem conseguiu no 1 aqui na minha cidade fui eu!
A game TRULY deserving of a remake in next gen.
He looks very different but hey...We actually got a silent hill game.
If it’s not Silent Hill PT then it ain’t right 😂
.
Se ve súper aburrido 😃.
A remake of Silent Hill about time they did this 🎃🎃
I wish they used the original voices from PS2 version…
Silent Hill is so legendary that everytime there's thick fog IRL I used to call it Silent Hill
remember konami. remember genso suikoden series 😭
The fact that Sony paid for 2 year exclusivity makes me sick
Guess Konami learned their lesson by going Pachinko smh
Is this game like resident evil?
A classic, returns
Jeremy Fragance?
Mais hipe que resident 4 remake pra mim !
I'm very upset we finally got another silent hill and it's a fcking remake. Idc. I've literally given up on Video games.
Iconic
PS4??
I will play it, yes, but only if i can use the old original soundtrack! So please, let my dream come true and i give you my money!!
I don't get it, they cancelled the gold score with Hideo Kojima, Del Torro, and Norman Reedus, then realised how big of market/fan base has only to remake Silent Hill 2... What?
never let anyone with an xbox even try .... so no thanks not buying it just bc of the favoritism
They're making a full game out of that pachinko machine??!?? :0
It's missing a fair bit of Guy Cihi... This game will be either a tremendous insult or a rather unimaginative rehash. I'm sorry, but Konami's record is quite tarnished.
I remember playing this on the ps2 back in 02-03. I never got to beat it cuz I was stuck. I can’t believe they remastered it. I’m gonna try to beat it this time around on the remastered version.
silent hill 1 is the one that needs remaking. but oh well
DIOSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Is this a dream?
This is game im looking more forward to then the new silent hill. Can't wait for this remake! 💯😫🙏🏼🔥
Nice
😎😁de que tiene graficos bien realistas se apega a la historia. se ve muy prometedor este Silent Hill. es una Chulada👌👍
como fazer um machuuu chorar: SILENT HILL 2
Graphics: 10/10 Acting: 1/10
😻😻😻😻😻
Simultaneous release on PC please, thank you!! :D
Don't trust Konami these days
somehow the better graphics makes it less scarier lol
Can’t wait…😞
my favourite horror series is back to life
But why is the hill silent
the soundtrack is going to be incredible
Why is his voice like that of a ragged and rough hero and not that of a broken ordinary man like in the original, he looks like a model with a rough beard and strong jawline. Already kinda disappointed that they're gonna make it all hollywood  Obviously I desperately hope that I'm wrong but I'm not liking the odds without Kojima
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m happy this is back so I have an excuse to listen to the music
ps5 finally has a new game
What a great time to be alive
Konami❤❤❤❤
Why did they change his face from the Original . .  Did I miss something ?! Other than that everything looks amazing
i just hope they dont f-it up
ill still wait for the real silent hill that didnt made it
is this a new game game or a remastered version?
nonfknway
Press X to cry
Finally some silent hill
One of the most terifying Games i have ever played. A Masterpiece
👍👍🇹🇷🇹🇷
WooooooooW! Aí sim! Único remake que quero jogar!
GET READY FOR ALL THE REMAKES!!!!! (The boxing guy voice - Michael Buffer)
Oh my... 🥳
thanks for ruining the game

Жду теперь, когда Куплинов ее пройдёт
QUEM GOSTOUD O TREILER LIKE SE NAO DIABO OLHAR OK
DEUS = COMPARTILHA MÃE = CURTY DIABO OLHAR
gente quem achou paredcidie com o leo do resident eivl deixa laike quem nao axo comenta vamo la interaje
Okay so I’ll admit the new voice isn’t that bad actually
Леон Кеноди скорректированный слега главный герой. Совпадение? Не думаю?
They should announce the mgs3 remake too. I know they've been working on it...
Garbage chinese sony pony game
The most sick and f^cked up game I ever played. But I loved it.
Why would they remake it? I understand teenagers only care about graphics but the original still looks great
Finally a PS2 game that looks like a PS3 game
此系列 非常老套
Huh, isn't it a MGSV sound effect at 1:52 ?
i still remember Silent Hill on PS1 was so scary and creepy:) never forget that game!
Yes
Am I the only one hearing Paint It Black 0:35?
OMFG I need this... Would love a complete ps5 release of them all
QUE????!!!!! juegazo la ptamdr😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
give me a ps5 and ill buy this game
And I thought the RE4 remake had me wanting a PS5...
I don’t know why people hate on James’ design. I personally love it, he looks messed up.
Better than adipurush graphics
期待
Умоляю,откройте доступ к покупкам,ну емае
Cuando alguien dice "estamos intentando mantener la escencia del original" nada sale bien, espero equivocarme
Someone can tell me what is Silent Hill about? Don’t know this game
woah
Finally, one of the best horror games ever made returns from the dark.
just tell me when? ^_^
@endlen we never finished silent hill :(
i somehow mis the vibe from the original, one of the best games ever made.
Póngale buena música y será el Boom
James looks awful..
Nul, c'est pas Kojima donc nul. Et puis sincèrement la bande-annonce, nulle.
OMFG finally something for us for silent hill fans after a decade.
fuKonami
Ps4 plzzz :(
Как всегда на уровне  Konami ❤
Графон 10х годов.
this aint real it cant be komani hates video games
Poor James Sunderland, he's about to get messed up for a second time
Silent Hill 2 Remake PS5 game, Silent Hill 2 movie... Thank you Genie, I don't need the third wish.. Oh wait, Silent Hill F.
El detalle del respiradero de Pyramid Head a lo mascara de sadomaso en uno de los laterales me ha enamorado. Aún si Pyramid Head es el producto de la mente trastornada de James, para el no es el mero diorama de pacotilla de un monstruo detrás de un armario sino algo de carne y hueso. Y como tal, algo que necesita respirar. Podrían haberle inyectado trembolona en los brazos. Pero nada intimida más que  esa lona arrugada y ese tubo. No se siente como un monstruo. Sino como alguien real. Con nombre y apellidos. Me viene a la mente "la habitación roja de Pyramid Head" en el juego original. Insinuando todo lo que ocurre fuera de cámara. Bravo por los diseñadores.
BS nothing will beat PT KOJIMA version fc konami
Ps4?????
One of my favorite horror game.
great, now my nightmares are in ultra 4k HD. Thanks konami
Only for ps5 really capcom? * Ps4 jet engine noise angered user*
hope they don't cancell is this time
Its Leon after drunk?!
Both games will co-exist together side by side.  10/26/2022
not coming to Xbox? interesting to show this to CMA and explain a little about Sony's commercial policy
02:30 saben si ya salió el soundtrack?
Is silent hill f is different game?
当時のCGは本当にすごかった。 スマホのない時代。 たった一つでもポイントを見逃すと前に全然進めなかった日々が懐かしい。 30年も前の話し。
I'm sorry mommy konami....I WAS WRONG.....I DOUBTED YOU WHEN I SHOULDNT HAVE....ITS FINALLY BACK BABY!
nxt remake DINO Crisis
nice nice nice
Very creepy game, I hope this becomes a thing, I'd buy it.
Everyone still watches the movies it makes sense they remake it
Это просто Ахуенно!
еееее
We want the Arabic language in the game
🙀🙀🙀
Should have kept Hideo Kojima. Would have been 10x’s scarier.
Silent Hill 1 needed a remake much more desperately. Silent Hill 2 still holds up well today. It is, without a doubt, one of the best games ever made. Silent Hill 2 in modern graphics is a dream come true. Silent Hill 1, 2 and 3 will always be among the best horror games.
Leon Kennedy in silent hill 🤣
Why does this have sound? It's supposed to be silent
I can definitely recommend playing this game as a child, as I did with the original.
Schmutz
Thank you PlayStation and Konami❤
❤❤❤😍😍😍
Return of pyramide head it’s à dangerous friend on play2
I bet you paying to block Xbox release you sscumbag company
заебисьььььььььььььььььььььььь
they should have use the sountrack too
can't wait
Ok,very nice,but now give us back Metal Gear Solid.
I hope that I can buy it
Wait what
I loved death stranding, I hope  silent hill has elements of that game like the travelling and carrying stuff.
Awesome cant wait
PT? 😢
James face morphs in every different scene.
Please make this a reality  and I will preorder it
Kojima probably rolls his eyes right now
will be in 30 fps xd ?
Dus ñ uit daaging!
Fake news.. don’t believe it. I was just saying we need remasters
Unbeliavable! New era?
2:40 how did pyramid head walk through the door with his head being huge?
ваще не то пальто
Awesome
I want it! I don't care about the price
great flash bang at the end
Amazing
Ya’ll ever see cockroaches in the original Silent Hill 2? It’s been awhile since I played, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen one.
Alguien sabe si este juego estará disponible en el play station 4 pro ?
I wish it had been launched for Play Station 4 pro u.u I don't know if this game will become available for this console.
Please don't change the soundtracks!
Woah the graphics on this are crazyyy 🙌🏾
Almost 5M views! and NOW ALMOST 10M VIEWS!!
No way, P.T. 2
Bought!!!!!
👍👍👍👍
no more ash snow 👎🤮
Looks amazing! Hopefully they do away with the tank controls.
Wait...why not silent hill 1??
I still have a Game Informer with the one that was cancelled.
Why am I nervous about the fact that blooper team is making this?
MF fed-up with zombies now days all developer only one to make zombie games
Who never got the chance to play the original and now is loving they are remastering it?
The native american type face has nothing to do with blonde hair, pick one but don't mix it.  Doesn't seem like using motion capture, movements are the old freehand by now. Could use a little more contrast on the lighting Not exiting at all to me
This stuff gave me ptsd when i was six
"It all ends in me!"
Cockroaches have become more realistic, in general the game has not changed since the PS2...
Is this trailer CGI or not?
@MiawAug @Windah Basudara mainin game nya bang 😁
My ps5+ LGcx1 = a gift from the heavens 🙏🏽
Wow, just wow...
Well that was unexpected
Emotions like in a game of chess
amazing
Theme of Laura please
Is this a remake/remaster or a new game like P.T. would be?
He looks quite older than 29…?
Para ser de playbsattion 5 se ve muy mal. Deberian mejorar loa movimientos y los graficos.
Wait, what. ???    Am I seeing this correctly ????
Trop hâte, trop hâte, trop hâte, trop hâte, trop hâte, trooooop hâte
I hope they don't F this one up too like MGS..
finally...
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Man i remember playing this for hours a day
Time to put the series x to the side
James looks a bit like Leon, with some modified face rig. He does not really like James Sunderland from the original game... they butchered the character design just like Jill in RE3 remake...
I want to play this game again on PS5 😭 so very nice graphic
Me parece perfecto y una gran idea revivir este juegazo en mejores gráficas, pero por qué no empezaron con el remake del primer silent hill??
couldnt stay longer than 20 seconds
Where is James Sanderland? Who is this man?
I've chosen to have faith in you one more time. SO YOU BETTER MAKE THIS RIGHT KONAMI.  P.S: Please port all Metal Gear games to PC.
I hope dino crisis got remake
Где Норман Ридус?
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Idk about this chief… Mary's giant head in the clouds like she's Mufasa at the end is kinda funny though
I SEE Silent Hill 2 but I'm not HEARING Silent Hill 2   D'';*
Finally been talking about/asking for this for yearsssss
Its great but wheres Dino Crisis
Наконец-то, удосужились вспомнить одну из главных франшиз, благодаря которой стали успешными и знаменитыми, и пол века не прошло
If Silent Hill is getting a remake, I still have hope that Silent Hills can come back
Nice👍🏻🎮😃
Yo this will be epic 🤯
PS4 plz 😢
Take my entire wallet!!!
So much for fuckonami, huh guys?
You Promised To Take Me There Again One Day ...................... You Finally Did............. !!!!!!!!
this is the best of the best game of all time , and this remake look amazing, this is  diamond not game
The epic older. Rise againts
Meu deus eu amo tanto essa franquia, ainda nem acredito...ta lindo o remake, já to mega ansioso 😍❤️
Ждём снова на пк =)
dissapointed at this decision, tbh. And the atmosphere of the og is not well represented in whatever this is. This feels more like a tech demo than a faithful recreation of SH2.
Remake silent hil 1 and 3 please!!
水と死
I'm afraid they'll try to overdo it, make the graphics less gritty, get rid of the stationary cameras, etc. Basically pull a homecoming on us
Fuckonami.
Leon?
Looks awesome, but I'm still bitter about PT...
Выглядит как какое то говно.По моему ремейк делали люди, которые никогда не видели оригинала.
Man playstation is killing the horror titles scene rn. They been dropping straight fire lately.
Definitely been waiting for silent hill to be reborn I hope it continues from here on
Am I the only one who thinks James looks like Leon S. Kennedy if he was a dad in his mid 30s???
It’s about F’ing time!! Yes!!!
Porque fizeram do Silent Hill 2 e não do Silent Hill 1 ?
Silent hill pra mim é um funk
The nostalgia and feels!
They should remake Silent Hill 3.
Well time to  bust out the top ramen and save up for a PS5 for real now
Great game, great music ❤❤❤
I'm extremely excited and happy about this...but my only complaint so far is how they made James look older. He didn't look that old in the original game.  I'm still going to play this though and I'm sure that it will be great. 👍 🙂
So they remade it ?
SILENT HILL ONE REMAKE?
Bloober Team 😒
Now if Konami has ANY sense, they'll give us An MGS 1, 2, 3 and 4 remake, easy money for them
Looks awesome 🙂
P.T
I hate the Age of Remakes and Reboots!
is this multi player?
I see the cockroach , and im already scared.
I wanted the old VA for James :C
คิดถึงพี่เบย์เลยครับบ
Next Burnout Takedown PS5
IM SO EXCITEDDD
Expectation of game graphics when I bought my series X  Reality : 2011 Minecraft
I still have no faith
A few days ago I was like “There’s no reason for buying PS5 now”  And now I’m waiting for the day when I’ll  be able to buy it !! Must play this game
I'm just patiently waiting for Callisto Protocol 🤟🤟
a esto me refiero cuando digo que si se les acaba las ideas para nuevos juegos en las nuevas generaciones, remasterizarlos de forma epica, hay muchos juegos que esperan su remake
Where the original theme tho
can't wait for the pc release.
Am I going to have to buy a PS5 just for this game? We need this for PC!!!!!
что за бред!вторая часть вышла бог знает когда !а это ремейк первой части которая была на первой соньке
The graphics aren't doing much for me.  It looks too....polished.  Think i'll stick with the PS2 version.
Watching this trailer has brought horror memory from my childhood  when i played this game
So is this a remake? I haven’t played a silent hill video game in over 15 years.  Nothing in this trailer rang any bell for me in terms of lore. 😅
Kian Egan from Westlife is James Sunderland! :'0
Что за просадка ФПС??
They..... they're...... no way........ I........
Cheerful.
daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa exclusivo....dejate de joder
I love Silent Hill.....🔦📻
Why in 2022 do video games still look so fake? This trailer looks like it could have been done in 2010.. Why have graphics and humanlike movements with AI not progressed?
с кайфом я аж пукнул 😎
Ain't no P.T.
😍
Game name: Leon Kennedy's retired life
i swear if SH2 is a PS exclusive/PC….I SWEEEEAR
Not ps4 really?🤦🏼‍♂️👎🏼👎🏼
Bout time you caught up with resident evil.
look  what they did to my boy  °(°ˊДˋ°) °
Amazed they got round to it before they closed.
Please don't be bad
THIS IS IMPOSIBLE
But will we get dog ending?
Best game
Classic return
i swear, if the dog is not in the game...
He looks like Leon Kennedy after hard drinking
About time! I’ve been waiting TWENTY YEARS!!!!!
fan made game with these graphics right?
hope they dont give it the re3 remake treatment
I cant wait for the soundtrack for this
koami must be running out of money.
The great hypocrisy of PlayStation
Listo ahí tienen para todos las bastardos q jodian y jodian con Silent hill listo sus lágrimas ya pararsn para q se callen de una vez
PORFIN KONAMI.
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
Me voy a desmayar
😬
Looks fantastic I never played a Silent Hill game cause I used to be a Nintendo guy but now I have a PS5 and this one goes straight to my wish list ☝️😁
Wow i cant wait and id love to see silent hill 1 and 3 remade as well.
Crying...
This is going to be the game of a life time
I might have to pick up a PS5
Looks like I need to finally play through the old ones on an emulator.
Do it for computer too!!!!!
Looks and sounds like garbage
whoa!
Is this release on ps4 at all?
Hoop they remodel james face...
первые кадры будто отсылка к киберпанку))
GENIAL PERO DEJA MUCHO QUE DESEAR LOS GRAFICOS
Ждём на пк
I hope they go crazy (Pun intended) when they release the PC version. Would love to go back into this serious classic.
In my restless dreams, I see that town, and I’m so glad to be back.
I wish konami brings us shattered memories remake too !
Well made like graphic but not scary at all
PS1 game released on PS5 with graphics from PS3
Man, now I really have to buy a PS5 I guess...
Terrible
UwU
<3 huh radio...
can't believe that doggo is still going at this behind locked door at lakeview hotel
20 years memory comes back...
Amazing but missing the original music
Bring back the film grain and make the game grittier looking. This trailer looks nice but just a bit too neat.
The best Silent Hill game is back!  I CANNOT wait!!!
León sal de ahí no es tu juego 🙂
Wohoo
happy tears
Max Payne ❤
please bring back PT
Love this game, take my money!!
Silent hill 2 forever left a mark on my memory as the most atmospheric game I have ever played … also the best soundtracks …
FAKE! IMPOSSIBLE!
Looks mid
The vibe is very different...
Thanks KONAMI!!!!!
I nevered played any of the silent hill games when i was younger, so im hyped  to finally experience them
Am I dreaming? Are we going back to the Original Lore and keeping true to what made it stand out back  in 1990?
Is this just for ps5 or can you play it on ps4
😭🤍
something strange with James' face here. Don't like it at all((
Konami has become a remake factory.
💥👍👍👍💥
I start looking forward to silent hill 3😂
imagine this in open world exploring all silent hill
Great, but what about Part 1?
Ok guys PS5 might have game
Mehhhh
Bro my dad cameos at 2:00
Konami, please sell franchise Capcom
I was supposed to be afraid or something?
I didn't expect the game to come back to life 🥹
omfg  frrrr??? am i dreaming?????? ... m legit having goosebumps rn🥲
Yoooooo
algo me dice que la americanizacion de este titulo, va arruinar algo de la experiencia. solo digo, hay algo que no me agrada en su apariencia pero bueno las decisiones las toman los jefes de diseño, creo que lo plantearon mal; sin embargo se agradece el "remaster"
Is the ufo ending still there?
верните team silent, тогда я поверю, что это не говно
se ve re genial, aun asi amaria que el remake fuera del silent hill 1
Now it's time to end this...
Looks terrible
Una buena razon para comprarse una PS5
Whatta bout silent hill 1? No love Konami! 💔
seems Leon got old and busy between RE2, RE4 and SH2?🤔
About time ..
My eyes became a little wet when I watched this. The fact that after so many years my favourite game is still alive made me shocked
We need it for ps4
Looks bad and this is coming from a true fan of the franchise.
ебануца
Wow
REMAKE ?
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO
Was six-seven when the original came out, I waited quite some time for this and number four to be remade xD
A remake by blooper team aweeee yeah
The Day Of the Night is one of my favorite BGM I have ever heard ….
КОДЗИМА ГЕНИЙ, ВЫТЯНУЛ ИГРУ СВОИМ ОТСУТСТВИЕМ
We don't need better graphics, we want better stories.
What happened to a remake of the original? Did I miss that?
БООЖЕ МЭРИ
Err did I miss the Silent Hill 1 remake or did they skip right to 2?
Nice!!!
The new James looks ugly :(  Why did you have to change his face Konami ????
Don't do this. Don't give us hope 😢
Can I play this without having played number 1
Thanks KONAMI to come back and making this new Silent Hill games always my favourite horror games
silent Hill 1 one plz remake
YEEHAW BABY!!!
silent hill without any glorious touch of Hideo Kojima?, well imma put my expectation low so I'm not going to get disappointed.
why they remake the 2 not the 1?
old version is better 1000 times!
Holy sh*t, I’m so hyped.
leon s kennedy ? is you
Yesss will be buying Day 1! Alexa, play Snow on the Beach by Taylor Swift feat. Lana del Rey 💅😌
[anime conniption fit]
I knew this wasn't P.T. but a part of me still has hope that someday we might see an announcement. Anyway, excited for a Silent Hill game after so long.
soooo PC gamers run into tough luck, eh?
выглядит как красивое кинцо
1:53 this exact sound effects plays at the deployment screen in MGSV
It's back! My favorite saga is back! The king of psychological horror is back! I'm so happy right now. :'D
weird as usual
Was there a Silent Hill 1 remake?
Lol
Where is the raid sound?
remake MGS！ Konami
Туфта, а не тизер!!! 😖
Only for ps5;
Im so glad the best horror game ever made is finally getting the love it needed.   This remake changes so many things
In tangled dreams I walk alone. See if you find that silent hill.
Where's remake of silent hill 1? Why 2 right away?
I really want to see the remake of the dog ending when this releases.
The only thing I don't like is the flashlight, it should be the flashlight on the cellphone or the flashlight that is being held.. that used to be Silent Hill.. ❤️
Гена Букин с прической Леона Кеннеди
Release date ?
Maybe one day they will make a silent hill 1 remake. That needs a remake more than the second one.
I want original face....😢
30 FPS gak tuuh
impressive, very nice      now let's see metal gear solid
man this look beautiful
I’m happy it’s getting a remake but I want a new game
Meh
Silent Hill is back 😭😭😭
Hellloooo graphics bbhyiii
Still one of my favorite games of all time. Can’t wait to get the platinum trophy.
silent hill is not "silent" anymore!!!!!!!!!
i could swear that was the paint it black music
Please Konami. Metal gear solid!
Time to bonk monsters until my fingers go numb from spamming again 😄
get ready to ur pants
Finally! I've been waiting for this for 20 years
Without Kojima?
So glad masahiro ito is helping with this. I have faith It's gonna be a very nice compliment to absolute classic. I'm more curious how bloober is gonna handle the combat, the original was clunky so it made facing enemies difficult in tight spaces which added to the scare factor.
Супер! :)🎉
James=Liam Neeson
Where is ghe remakae of og silent hill?

ITS EPPPPPIIIIIIICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC YEAH L LOVE THIS
Now where's my metal gear ⚙️
Este tiene que ser el regreso de uno de los mejores saga de juegazos survival horror de la sony ps 2 un juego que me marco en mi juventud, un juego que me dio unos de los mejores Original Soundtracks de la mano del legendario Akira Yamaoka, un juego que me hizo explorar una de las mas aterradoras ciudades llenas de traición, inocencia, avaricia, creencias, Muerte ... ... quiero llorar . Gracias Konami !!.
dreams come true
I'm so happy for this
Hopefully It Comes To PC!
Нихуя не понял, но очень интересно
Can't wait 😍
This actually looks really bad. considering what P.T looked like. Another major flop just like the HD Version
！！！！！！！！！
can't wait anymore
banana-man?
Look very promising but fuxk Konami
leon is that you
Yesssss
Can't wait for the Let's Play of this game because I'm too much of a coward to actually play scary games lol
While it's cool that this game is coming back. I am so tired of stupid remakes. Just make a new game for once people! Stop remastering and remaking 20 year old games.
Graphics looks like early PS4 though...
are they following capcom way now ?
I hope this Game make the Same effect like Resident Evil 2 Remake After that we Need Silent Hill 1 and 3 Remake!!!
Konami make castlevania curse of darkness remake pls
PSVR2?
@MiawAug
I thought Konami said they'd never touch video games off of cell phone ever again. Kinda the reason Kojima was axed
They’ll probably make it woke.  Mary is probably non-binary now or some such…
I used to play in psp❤
Why thwy didn't start with silent hill 1?
Hey Konami.  Don't mess it up!
WOW!!!!!!!
In the original James in the mirror scene looks at the player, but it can be hardly seen. Remember it's not the original creators
wow
Leon back to lpd , you have a village to investg
i always had faith
awesome
Супер игруха 😮
I never thought Leon Kennedy is now in Silent Hill. Lol
release date 2028
Nothing can beat the original, because it has its own atmosphere, the dated graphics, is like a well aged wine. but it made me happy to see one of my childhood games getting attention again.  cheers.
Time to buy a ps5
This is impossible
Auf der PS5 dann mit 30fps I guess lol
조국 생각나노
Bruhh it's crazy
The best horror game ever.
Będę czekał.
They better bring back the Ending with the dog. I won´t buy that game untill I they confirm the dog ending!!!
WHERE  IS  P.T.
Жду прохождения от Blackufa))
Ummmmm, I could’ve done without the roach scene!! Kill me.
Leon,it that you?
Что это?
Goosebumps… finally you idiots figure out this was your best game
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Boy the scariest one… the room is as scary too
Did Pyramid Head get thinner?
Русская гнида здесь есть?
What whay did I see this so late and i definitely and completely lost my faith it will ever come back
Наконец то, я думал что Silent hill метв после трагедии со Кодзимой и 2015 годом. Но чудом воскресилась игра. Интересно, а будет игра не только на PS5, а ещё на ПК, Switch, Xbox series X/S?!
The trailer literally showed nothing happening in the game
The world is so creatively bankrupt…
Is this Edward Norton?
It looks amazing I can’t wait
Это ахуенно
Zawsze ciary na plecach...świetna gra...
I'm not your Mary.  What a game
Kak regi harus main
Pl ease please please bring back the original voice actors! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Please bring back the original voice actors! 🙏🙏
still waiting for the full version of PT to come 😢
Я вообще больше ждал ремейк 1-ой части. Именно графически ремейк с небольшими изменениями, а не то что мы имеет SH - Shattered Memories, это всё таки не то. Вот делать ремейк 2-ой части, честно говоря не совсем понимаю. 2-ая часть и так шикарна, это шедевральная игра и самая моя любимая часть серии. Обожаю вторую часть именно за атмосферу и переживания главного героя, депрессивности. Ну раз будет ремейк именно 2-ой части, я очень надеюсь что они сделают с не большим отрывом от оригинала, а ещё я очень надеюсь что они не вставят эти дурацкие QTE что есть в Резиденте. Да, в оригинальную игру на ПК (не HD Remastered) на современных компьютерах поиграть трудно (из-за тормознутости, потери звуков и музыки) портится вся атмосфера игры, так как оригинал на ПК делали тогда, когда не существовало многоядерные процессоры, 2001 год, поэтому если вы хотите пройти Silent Hill 2 с комфортом и оригинал - качайте версию на PlayStation 2 и играйте либо на самой приставке или на эмуляторе (я кстати на эмуляторе её и прошёл, всё чётко)
я конечно не гинеколог, но это пизда. Я в ахуе. Нет слов просто, одни эмоции
Даже в SH:H было куда больше атмосферы, чем в этой халтуре!
tha music in this game is immaculate.
Hey, that’s not *norman reedus*
After a thousand years.
I hope the ufo and dog ending is still in this game 😊😊
первую часть вообще переиздать нужно
No release date. Maybe this will be FFVII remake it’s going to release on the final year of the PS5 era. Just guessing and joking I know Bloober team have a lot of great talent.
サイレントヒルの歌2022とか作ってくれないかなw
I dumped my perfectly working ps5 in the store wrapped in a bag haven't been playing for months now lol 😂
Графен прям моё почтение
James looks like dream
I have never played this game so I am definitely curious!
Kind of looks like a ps3 game graphically, but hope it turns out well.
i’m too poor to enjoy this
호럴
uy
To bad scalpers still sell your systems lol Otherwise I would maybe be able to play a game, but not giving into the scalpers
I need a ps5 now!
So sad James never got out of Silent Hill.
2:43 And here comes MY BOI
Guys in video games always have that Beckham kind of haircut don’t they?
despues del dia que conoci a mi novia este es el dia mas feliz de mi vida
They have fog!! Yes!
Didn't know that konami's still making video games
My favorite part of the stream but I still wish Kojima was part of the project
The 60hz really give this “the touch”
😌 yeah finally
can't believe it ♥
This is unreal!
What about P.T.?
Euh.... et la date de sortie ?
its finally back!
Where’s silent hill 1
stoked to see this, silent hill 2 is undoubtedly one of the best, if not the best, psychological horror games ever made
Is it available on ps4 as well?
De tanto que lo veo al trailer, creo que medio millón de views son mias.
If you mess this game up I will literally kill myself. So do it right. My life is in your hands Konami.
The lighting seems a little too bright in places, but otherwise I'm definitely looking forward to the game, hoping it's got options to modify lighting to give it a bit more of the shadowy noir feel that the original has
No way!!!! Is this for real??
Is it a zombie or ghost game ❓❌❌❓
I swear if its 3rd person ima...  Nevermind.
:')
GUILLERMOOOO WHERE ARE YOUUUUU
One of my favorite games ever! Hope the PS5 remake keeps it right. I'm really surprised this is happening. Can't wait for it.
Now do SH1
It's been soo long since I played this. ...I still remember waking up in the middle of the night to play it. And how its music made it into my mind long after I stopped playing. Real horror. Can't wait!
Now please remake The Legend of Dragoon !!
bubblehead in ps5? worth it
ok, that is a surprise.
a dream come true.  now we need kojima and the original soundtrack
It's a legit for real :) I can't wait to play this game, eversince I play all silent hill games from before to present
Pyramid head is back
Lets go
รอดูช่องเฮียเบย์เลยครับ อิๆ☺️☺️☺️
I just hate his face, they should use the original character's face
Silent hill 2 was amazing and Silent hill 3 was incredible. Every other silent hill we’re terrible. Especially Downpour
One of the best games I've ever played hands down
Mukanya cocok jadi leon s Kennedy usia 60tahunan
SH1 RmK?????????????? ❤️➡️💔
legend is back okay😏
For a second I thought there was a sequel to this game already but I guess not, glad they remembered this game and decided to make a sequel
Em Silent Hill 2 do ps2 uma das coisas mais marcantes é a trilha sonora que encaixa perfeitamente, e pelo jeito nesse remake vai mudar 😢
Me vine
Ugh..  take my money...
Esse jogo vai ser top, pena que não vão lançar no Brasil
James looks hawt ❤️
Dude I got nightmares from all these Silent Hill games. They're terrifying. This looks promising. I can't wait! Please don't let us down Konami! This looks more like a reimagining than a remake. Or well a remake-reimagining? Blah. Don't even know it's the same! Can't wait!
📲📲 Hello, Akira Yamaoka?
parece juego de play 3, que mal se ve.
「いいか！ストーリーの入りなんだからな！気合い入れてしっかりやれよ！実物じっくり観察してこれ以上ない出来のを作ってくれ！     じゃあゴキブリのモデリング頼むぞ！」
I’m worried they will not be respectful in portraying Angela but moreover LFGGGGGGGG
How many years did it took them to do that exactly? And it still looks like a 2010-like quality...  Probably going to wait for about 20 more years for the remaster of this remaster... Thanks lol.
I wonder what the main theme will be I mean nothing can compare to Theme Of Laura but I just hope it's something decent
Increíblemente hermoso !
Me and my bros are all excited!!! This game was sooo scary yet fun!! Still have the PS2 copy and PS2!
*Это что, графика из начала 2000-х?*
I love all the people saying they should skip this and just play the ps2 version. I have and love that game, but it is lacking mechanically and gameplay wise by todays standards. On top of that, looking online a ps2 copy of sh2 goes for around $100 so not exactly realistic for most people to drop that kinda cash on an old game.
This was so over due 😮😮😮😮😊
Rusty pipe? Or nail board? No ammo lol...
The last Sildent Hill I played was Shattered memories on the Wii 😭
Te Amo
LETS GOOOO
Starring Leon Kennedy
— 是你吗，慧娘? — 慧娘？我是慧娘，我是慧娘!
By the time this comes to PC, I would have lost interest. Just like Silent Hill 1 and Halo series.
Well never touch konamis trash ever again after what they did… they deserve a funeral not a memorial
Can't believe I can see James Dumberland return 👏
2...? what happened to 1? did I miss it ?
With all the underwhelming remakes of the past several years, this actually looks true to the original, as it should be. Hopefully this comes to PC...
PS: XBOX no puede comprar Activision por que puede que lo hagan exclusivo de la consola, o den beneficios a sus usuarios Tambien PS: SH2 exclusivo temporal
I'm still waiting for half life 3
Buying this day one on PC and I will buy it when it hits Xbox.
Why won't anyone remake the original Silent Hill?
Still using kojima’s old 2015 MGS V engine. Shame on Konami 😂
P.T It's better
Silent Hill 4: THE ROOM please!!! this game deserves a remake
Only took a few decades, but here we are
Make new games
Silent hill 2 remake 😱 But made by gringos 😴
I remember play Silent Hill in PS2 long time ago, and now Silent Hill 2 come back in PS5 ?? wow such a long long time for comeback
Im so excited. Now konami, release it on pc
💩💩💩
It's going to be on the pc right
I wish they were released on PS4 as well!
Idc, this 8s being bought. I cannot wait
не страшно
Fck yeah Leon Kennedy!!!
I'm looking forward to it
I hope they don't dare to change the original soundtrack
7 years of fighting to revive this saga and now we get 3 of them?? Count me in
Silent hill esta lindo
Continuo aqui. Legendas pt br
Yes dude yes yes yes yes and yes.
Meu sonho é jogar o novo sillent hill
wow
А какого члена? Где первая часть?
Who TF cares!!!!!!!!! Stop with the remakes FFS!!!!!!! There is absolutely no creativity left in making new video games!
2:29 what's the name of the piano music? I've never played Silent Hill 2.
Pls make this also in ps4 its been long time we have a silent hill game eplddd
No pc port?
The legend show again
Finally a decent game release !
The legend is comeback
Cool graphics, back to 2010!
Xbox Series X. 😍
Wasnt impressed with the trailer
Well, now I got another huge reason to buy the PS5
dang they really improved with expressions, huh?
Now we only need Dino Crisis to fully experience time travel.
Why do they call it oven when you of in the cold food of out hot eat the food? Yes
Super excited.
how is that possible, konami doing silent hill games again?
the face expressions are really creepy
Honestly, I would like to see Silent Hill 1 Remake.. ❤️💞
If they care about fans, they will include Eddie and Angela modes where you play their stories and experience their version of the town, but doubt they’ll even think about it.
It's amazing how they managed to preserve the character's original feelings and emotions without modifying or removing it 😢💔
Wow James Sunderland vuelve
Here we go again 🫠
There was a COMMENT  here. It's gone now.
Yo!!!!!
Dont like the main character new face, but everything else f... welcome!!
Regreso a cada rato para ver este hermoso trailer, no puedo creerlo aún. Soy tan feliz😭
This looks beautiful, but I do sort of feel like the town and monsters looks to clean, they are supposed to be gross, dirty, filthy, bloodied and worn out, representations of of James' darkest hidden feelings come to horrible, decaying life
unica coisa que da pra falar ao ver o trailer, UAU... TO SEM PALAVRAS sem duvidas vai ser  o melhor
TF is this?!! where is my pachinko machine!!!!
yeahhh king is back🔥🔥
Wow another remake, great
when this game after what 25years? isn't a masterpiece i'll start to learn how to build bombs and place them in every creators studio! This must be as perfect as me!
Aged Leon Kenedy is now in Silent Hill ))
I still can't believe this is happening. I keep watching it over and over. lol
Dont looks profissional... its like the same grafics and moviment are so fake..
Guaranteed it'll be a let down
i'm so happy that this is happening in my lifetime
Is it on ps4 to?
ca aurait ete cool d'avoir Boromir ^^
Will there be a playable teaser? 😅😅😅😅
Amazing ❤️❤️❤️
These games are almost a chore to play because of the creepiness level of the music and monster design. I think Silent Hill 4: The Room was the creepiest but 2 was a close second. Can’t wait, thought they gave up on the series after PT.
OHH NOOOO GUYS, I mean, it's great BUT whyyyy, whyyy can't they bring original voiceover actors back?((
Am I dreaming???????????????????????????????????? WOWWWW!!!! after so many years waiting for a Silent HIll remake.... they made Silent Hill 2 REMAKE!!! I can't be happier
does anyone have that thumbnail picture without the PS logo?
From the size of the cockroaches, I can tell the location is Athens, Greece...🪳
VR2 enabled? Please please!
OH cool,  they now sell their new Pachinko games in the west too?
Great It took me more than 20 years to not have nightmares after playing this game.  When do I buy it? lol
heres me thinking they was gonna bring back PT
2:18 "YOU ARE TEARING ME APART MARY!"
Non-exclusive PS!))))
i've never been so excited for any other game other than Silent Hill. My teenage right there
I remember I beat this game I thought I couldn’t get threw it because I was scared
Silent hill is my all time fav game
I’ve always wanted to experience this the right way… I feel like they’re gonna deliver with heavy impact on future horror game creators.
2:39  BRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!
why does James look like Murphy?
The crazy thing is the PS2 original still looks amazing now. Its aged really well.
SILENT HILL 2? 23+ YEARS LATER?! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  I WILL BE 80 YEARS OLD WHEN THE THIRD COMES OUT HAHAHAHAHAHA
Akira Yamaoka never gets old <3
Doesn't anyone have creativity anymore? So tired of the prequels, sequels, remakes, etc. I want something new. Not sure that I understand how everyone else seems completely happy with having yet another remake.
What a game this was and what a game this is going to be!! Can not wait!
I have freaking chills
Looks like a PS3 game
Never remember silent hill 💔😞
I guess I'm buying a ps5.
Remake for Metal Gear Solid:Twin Snakes would be great
Something doesn’t seem right. It doesn’t have that Japanese stamp. Feels like an American copy. Is an American team developing this?
F@ck yeah!!!!
Get a divorce man!
Hi Leon ahhaah
😲😲😲😲😲😟🧐😱😱😱😱
Squid Game James
Konami.. we're waiting also for the Metal Gear 6..
Amazing!!! Can't wait to play!!!! 🤩🤩🤩
I'm actually gonna cry, I'm so happy abt this! 😭I can't wait for this game!
Welcome back to Ps3
After Konami see how much profit they will get. They will happily remake all the series.
Lets gooo babyyyyy
Please don't make it a generic shooter
That's what we really needed ❤️😎
I'm sick of remakes.
the trailers are always great, the proof is in the gameplay
Silent Hill without Kojima, Playstation without Sony 😶
Respect from *Flexible Guy* ❤️💪👍
Sure hope it'll be a complete game/sold in it's completion, rather than following the money mongering trend /standard of releasing it before being thoroughly tested & resolved for bugs/technical issues, making people buy multiple DLC's which should already be included in the game, microtransactions/pay-to-win tactics, and releasing "deluxe" versions for $100+ a year later. Sure hope they will have more integrity than all of that . . .
I know what you are 😦
Why will the remake only be on PS5
pyrahead looks sick asf
Anyone know the release date?
🥺🥺❤️🔥🔥🔥
Sillent hill but with a Resident Evil protagonist?
I loved the silent hill homecoming.... For me it is still the best game of this genre....
Зачем было легенду трогать ..
Can't wait for the dog ending
Super trippy seeing familiar areas in these graphics lol
Naguevonini lo deseo uffffff a reunir el dinero
Putting nostalgia aside.. I know its a teaser and its unfinished, but the graphics and atmosphere arent as scary/disturbing, even compared to PT..
Same graphic of a PS3 game... and it's a cinematic video! Come on, you can do it better Konami
Take my money already! 😤
They're just going to keep milking it...
Love that composer Akira Yamaoka gets top billing here.
Waiting for *theRadBrad* to find this! ❤️
I played the original SH2 20 years ago…time flies. I reserve my judgment until I play the remake. Oh yeah, don’t you remove the Dog ending!
P.T. !!!!!!! 2
@TheRadBrad
15 year old terrified me playing this in the dark, meet 34 year old me playing this terrified in the dark
Leon Kennedy if he was older.
Я ждал это с 2005 года, когда играл в Сайлент-Хилл на PS
Wow silent hill have their own version of leon
The Nurses lookin hella fine!
Лица перерисовали, Джеймс будто совершенно другой человек. Мария теперь не будет похожа на Кэмерон Диас?
1998 graphics... really not PS5 4K level.
Looks bad.
Awesome! Kinda looks like Leon from RE4.
Wow! So many memories. 😢
Opa mais um pra eu fazer série 🙌🙌🙌
PC RULES
Boycott Konami
Как всегда все серое, темное, смазанное, заблюренное, чтобы консольки могли хоть как-то работать. Когда уже закончится эта монополия консолей?
Fantastic
Hope it becomes easier to get this console. I have yet to get one...
Ждем.
This is addicting. I don’t remember how many I have watched this trailer so far!! Beautiful 😻
So weird how the trailer doesn't even mention Hideo Kojima. Hate how Konami has tried to completely erase him from this franchise.
I hope they get the small details from the original game right
exclusive lol cry boxes
Still mad they never dropped PT full version
It's on now
I don't like James' face, so I hate it :D
So ps5 exclusive hmmm well
still side children that the real ones arrived
Is not James face. Not original beautiful game. Fail.
That's leon hair cut
so boring. yikes
It already looks so bad way too much emotion from james
Ayoooooo???
За просраную фишку с зеркалом обидно...
Look it's my favourite SH and I don't like remakes or whatever but maybe people that only play HD games will finally know about this great franchise 🙄 But you better not change anything, especially the music Ò-Óv
Finally
We are waiting for remake of Legacy Of Kain Soul Reaver  !!!
About time
yessssss
go
go
Never forget.. P. T
Охренеть!
So excited! Truly a beautiful experience
Please make it for PS4 Pro too. This brings such special memories!!!!
Will this be released for Ps4 aswell? 👀
this is going to be disappointing
바퀴벌레 퀄은 베데스다가 갑인데ㅋㅋ
Can’t wait to put my phone in silent and play this in the dark with my headsets on
Porfin una real obra maestra
Porfin una real obra maestra
Silent hill 2s ambience is great. I just want to stay still and soak it all in.
I had a dream where Del Toro and Kojima were working together to bring one of the best silent hill games ever!  Well... at least we have a remake... again...
S.I.L.E.N.T.H.I.L.L
Old Leon
No koji...
P.T was one of the greatest teaser of all time.
They just muted my resident evil obsession
wohoho
Silent Hill, Meu jogo favorito
I loveit
Что здесь забыл Леон из Resident Evil?
Date! Date! Date?!🙏
If they manage to make it as true to the original as RE2 remake was, I'll be happy
Is this the game that was supposed to be made by Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro that got scrapped or is this a remake of an older game?
Yes finally a game worth getting the ps5 for !!
u better do sh1 remake
You literally have his head clipping through the door at 02:44. Unplayable! /s
Simply Amazing
I hope it delivers, they owe us that.
akira is my goat
Whats the piano music at 2:29 ?
Just wow 😍
Is this real or fan made???
Remakes...
it look great can wait to play it again!
He is leon s kenedi
I'd liked James to be more handsome here xD
Those graphics don't look impressive at all, nothing we haven't seen in PS4
El mejor el 1 y el 3 el 3 es la continuacion del 1
why James have so creepy-doll face now? he was a normal in original game
I love Silent Hill😍
It,s incredibly 🤯
Looks too much like unreal engine not gonna be that great probably mediocre.
I hope they remake shattered memories, that one was a masterpiece
I want the canceled silent hill. Thats  way better.
Will I be okay if I never played the original? They aren't really available on modern systems. (I've looked.)
PC available?
Que pu705 los de ps… si es un exclusivo de la consola, ya me compraron. Alv Xbox X
I really want to see pewdiepie play this game
Oh. My… 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Отличный графон! То-сё, спецэффекты всякие понапихали... Но знаете, почему мне нравился Silent Hill с 1999 по 2001-й год? Тем, что он был НАСТОЯЩИЙ, а не придуманный ; )
PC PLEASE :::)))
Que momento para estar vivo
My gosh...I'm mesmerized by this
Поверить не могу...
это же мужик из резидент эвил!
Now konami needs to do a silent hill1 and mgs1 remake bundle
Выглядит немного как игры Кодзимы. Интересно, использовались ли его наработки?
New Pachinko game!!! ... !!!YES!!!
So it's PlayStation exclusive... And Sony's crying over Activision sell
All I'm going to say is do it right, or don't bother.  No cut content.  No experience ruining monetization.  If the game is made with love and care with the sole intent to make a great game that honors what came before it I'm sure it will be a huge hit for years to come.  As a fan of the original games (especially 2) I'm cautiously optimistic about this.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA OH MY GOODNESS THAT’S REAL?????!??!!!?!!?
Putz!! Que jogo feio dá p@#$%
Genial, otro exclusivo de PlayStation
mais um filminho
Too Americanized
why did he become asian?
Well this was the best Silent Hill so i have to agree with the remake. Hopefully new SH games from here!
it's same graphics with resident evil but why the minimum gpu i saw in a post that you need atleast a gtx 1080 lol
Looks the same as I remember it from 2001?
I hope you take great care to develop / remake this game so epic and amazing , SILENT HILL 2 there are details of things so intimate that reflect a lot of a disturbed human being that are genius , now just wait and hope to be as epic as the original !🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Im so happy my favourite horror series is back to life :') Can't wait!
Finally back!
Even though I'm not much of a fan of the Layers of Fear series, something like Silent Hill is definitely right down Bloober Teams alley. Loved the Blair Witch game they made though, so here's hoping they do this justice.
Sweet. A de-aged John Bernthal. 😅😅
i thought it was PT
This one is the most terrifying of all the SH, the music, the atmosphere everything was creepy.
Im here for you james see? Im Real ...
Petition to bring back the Piano backtheme
No way
kendrick reference 🤯🤯
La 2??. Parece el protagonista de Downpour 😅😅😅...
You can do it Leon, I believe in you.
С хуяли на пс 5 выходит когда демо версия на пс4 была также? Вот сука когда даже на пс4 тянет игра на пятую плойку перескакивают. Продажники херовы
PYRAMID HEAD  PYRAMID HEAD  PYRAMID HEAD
Perfect, dedicated to playstation 5, they'll enjoy it at 30fps.
But what about silent hill 1? :o
Silentsident Evil
Extremely happy about this. I’m having mixed feelings with Bloober Team but I really want to give it a chance.
There is only one small problem ... ps5 are not found...
Don't forget the Theme of Laura, please ✌🏼
Is it just me or is anyone else getting the evil within 2 vibes
Pyramid Head getting that 4k nurssy
only hope this is not a remake pachinko version
Can't wait to play it on my PC with Ultra and 60FPS. It will be awesome.
А PS4 ? 😢
구리네... 명작을 괜히 다시 만들어서 망칠거같은 예감
Never thought I was gonna see this happen
Just wow.
Gracias a DIOS!  Why took you so long!?
Why not silent hill 1 remake ?
When I saw a cockroach...for an instant I got goosebumps....it's scarier than all the monsters in Silent Hill 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cancel this disaster and apologize to Kojima. Give us the Silent Hill game we were promised, Silent Hills.
I wasn't inspired by watching the trailer. Sry, fans. =\
I thought it was Silent Hills
If the Remake is worth it, maybe I'll think about it and buy the PS5 just for that game.   What I could not do as a child I will do now.
ps4는..????
Se mira de huevos!
Should i play the old silent hill now? Is it worth it?
LEON?
Lotta horror games getting remakes these days
It doesn't look scary.  The old is better.
Норман Ридус где 🧐
I don't own a PS5 but the day this is released I would buy one!!!
In my restless dreams... I see that town Edit: I got chills!
FKonami
I hope to get play station 5
bloober team logo is suspect, if you know you know.
Не страшная игра
Graphics looks amazing it's unbelievable. Most importantly it's running at 60fps. I can't wait for this masterpiece.
Wooooow  , não consigo expressar com palavras minha alegria
Легенда
now we wait..... for Parasite Eve... :D
very loud overpowering strokes from the strings and better cockroach modelling,  they truly are out of ideas to remake the classics.
Looks like a PS2 game
masterpiece
shut up and take my money.
It is no exaggeration to say that SH2 is the best masterpiece in the SH series, seriously. ガチのマジで静岡2はサイレントヒルシリーズ最高傑作だったと思う。心理描写が完全にオーパーツレベル
Born From a Wish better be included and not be some BS DLC
It's all ogre now
i am soooo excited for this. I was too young to play this when it came out and by the time i was older I had no access to a playstation. All i've read is how this is one of the best game of all time. cannot wait. p.s does anyone else miss the playstation graphics? made it creepier
i dunno if its just me but i feel like James Sunderland looks more haggard and older than how i imagined him to be. Everything is top notch. Just didn't imagine him looking like that but i guess it makes sense after all that hes been through. Edit: My bad I meant James Sunderland. I wrote harry mason before and those guys corrected me. I didn't check out the names. My bad.
Finally
que triste sony.... intentando tirar por tierra la compra de activision por parte de microsoft por que dicen que el call of duty lo pondrian exclusivo y esta gfente no para de sacr exclusivos, que hipocritas
Pyramid head is again just a guy with a mask 😒 Why didn't hey keep his head fleshy? Why did Masahiro Ito copy the film version and not his original one?
I still wanna play silent hill pt. The chills that I got from that game was insane  Edit: apparently,youtube becomes twitter. You can’t have an opinion on what you like or dislike. So many clowns fml
still no silent hills
Goosebumps...
💪💪😉
that thing looks like banana man from fortnite
A OBRA PRIMA de terror está de volta. Nem acredito 😢😢😢
So bad physic and graphic
If Silent Hill can happen, can Metal Gear Solid too?
the fact that the people behind Layers of Fear and Blair Witch are going to make this is probably the most horrific thing about it
This game makes me want to break in someone's house and toast all their bread and put it back in the bag.
O wanna see Laura and Eddie...
Best silent hill
The sound design the music is special , bringing back akira yamaoka is the best thing they ve done with this remake.
Yeah  but where Is silent Hills bruh (p.t)
Have to be honest.. I dont like James face, It seems very awkward to me... I hope the rest of the game lives up to the original masterpiece
Jeremy Fragrance ?!
Странно почему не первую часть делают
😮😮😮
Every person should boycott Konami. They are a disgrace in the gaming world. Konami stick your pachinko up your a$$
Leon Kennedy is old here.
that nurse is hot
блин, в игру не играл, но до сих пор помню, какой стремный был фильм...
У Сайлент Хилла какая то своя особая атмосфера-романтично мрачная.
INTERNALLY FREAKING OUT RN.
Heck yeah
After discontinued for years PT/Silent Hill is back!!!!!!
Silent Hill 2 is still a masterpiece until now... it's the best of the series of all time... I still remember playing Silent Hill 2 on PS2... the chill remains until today...
Lol. Let's see if can finish this game this time around
Konami remember silent hill!!!!!
IS THIS FOR REAL?
Super realistic game
Finally  We need a new one though
leon, its you ?? LOL
wooahhhh silent hill is back !
The more the world understands the importance of deep, intimate, human relationships the more it is obvious how it can be utilized to spread a message, be it video games, a product, business, you name it. I am rather content that this teenage memory of Silent Hill is being revived. The beauty of experiencing such a game is NOT to compare it to its predecessor or original, but to enjoy it as it is, as a completely new experience in and of its own.
Just the same soundtrack and every thing is okay thx !
❤
This is so cool
I've always wanted to play this game~
as long as they bring back the shiba ending. i'll be happy
Radbrads's gotta Rolling on his PC with happiness
Mister Pyramide 👌
That piano at the start what is it ?
So so so ugly model of gg
Настораживает то что разработчиками выступают поляки а не сами японцы. Атмосфера думаю будет не та уже.

김장훈 닮았네
All the same, the old version turned out to be more atmospheric. It's strange, but that's how it is.
best sh.
Would there be monsters jumping out from the roadside bushes on the way to the historical society?
Solo SILENT HILL 1 vale la pena
😍😳💪👍🤝
the least they could of done is HIRE Shawn Bean
one of the best game in my life.
aqqaaAAAAAAAAAAAAASFAFAAFAAFAAAJASSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
😯
ps5 bruh what about ps4 smh
I really love the new setting meeting at the gazebo with Maria. I think it's a very powerful striking image.
The game being so cinematic just make it less scary than the original for me. And seeing Jame acting so melodramatically is so off, dude was dazed and detached af xD
I love how James still moves in a dream-like and ps2-retro like movement.   Still feels trapped and confined to an uncomfortable space, even with the modern technology.
cant wait for footsteps asmr
Wow they are releasing a reboot of a game from a long long time ago, how original
I just want to see the dog ending with a modern look.
I just want them to remake "Silent Hill 4 The Room" it makes me nostalgic 😢
Some scene he look like Leon s Kennedy
PT memories, hope it doesn’t get canceled
Finally. A valid reason to buy a pS5
Looks great. Bring back ridge racer!
stupid konami
Me: After all this years! Konami: Always…
А где же тот самый крутой саундтрек из оригинала второй части??((
Yes please
I still can’t believe they are remaking this masterpiece after years of waiting and hoping. The original Silent Hill 2 game is my all time favourite horror game. I hope this remake can do it justice. Im just happy Silent Hill is finally back!!!
if the PES franchise is anything to go off, konami's already ruined this game before it started, made it unplayable in terms of gameplay and atmosphere, and added in game purchases
I really hope they keep the original music, or at least re make it similar. I'll never forget being in the bowling alley and "alone in the town" was playing. It was like the most perfect moment for me in the game
Eles vao estragar 😡
Por qué ellos pueden hacer exclusivo silencio Gil?
Silent hill 3 remake would be fire 🔥 😳
they literally just dumped this on us starving fans after like 15 years of trash
honestly this gives off like a typical playstation game vibes, and im not here for it at all.
Is this new game or remake
When pt though
i miss the 90s brings back my childhood memories playing this game in my neighborhood at 9pm after doing my homework then going home almost 1am running swiftly so scared. well...final boss is my mom and it's gameover.
There was a silent hill 1, when? And where?
One word. Wow!
Он заходит в туалет как будто прикончил Мэри своими руками 3 минуты назад а не как будто она умерла от болезни 3 года назад.
a PS5 exclusive, made by a studio with history of flops and likely being slapped with a 69,99€ price when it comes out doesn’t really appeal to me 🙃
Unreal engine really does unreal things
James looks like a young David Lynch, I can't get it out of my head lol
anyone knows the name of the song briefly played at 2:29 ?
It should also be released for Xbox one
I just hope they release it for PS4 as well so I can actually play it 😢😅
gráficos de ps4
The best remake
I'm sure this is just an ad for a slot machine somehow
oh boy graphics and music
The nostalgia...
What about suikoden2 remake?
I enjoyed the movie
Nothing can top the original. I actually think these fancy graphics is a detriment to the overall feel you get playing SH2
Give us a release date!
این سایلنت هیل هم از الان شکست خورده است من نمیدونم چه اصراری دارن بازم رو سناریو قبل اسکی برن
I’ve owned a real clean copy of silent hill 2 for years now and just recently purchased 3 and 4 both mint condition as well, case, instruction booklet and game disc, I can’t wait to play them
♥🦆
bruh
It's.. ...  A remake. so what?  Konami flops Silent Hills and tries to make a comeback with this?
Слишком мультяшка, слишком занудно, слишком не страшно...
WHy cant we have it for XBOX?
The masterpiece in game history is back!!!!!! 😭😭😭
how about Tenchu, Konami?
It would be cool if they made a new video game
50 views are from me alone 🤣
I know this is completely random, but is it just me that James sounds a lot like Chris from Family Guy. Please tell me I'm not the only one who thinks that.
i feel like i was born to play this game
*SCREAMING*
Im gonna cry im so excited
Shouldn't the graphics be better fora  PS5 game?
😱no me la puedo creer resident evil 4 remake ahora silent hill 2, lastima que no tengo una play 5 para jugarlos quizas algun dia 😭
This trailer actually captures the beauty of this gem and not just the horror. Real props to Konami, I meant it.
are you fu***s gonna cancel this one as well ?
when remake nightmare?
Considering what I know about konami. I hope this is at least made ethically this time
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Fiquei arrepiado vendo esse trailer, tá lindo demais esse remake.
Yall don't understand how much I needed this
The piano tune in the beginning, anyone else whom thinks it reminds of Paint it black by Rolling stones? Specially from 0:36 towards 0:55  There are some parts there that are really close to it.
that will be kinda boredom game i guess but i liked it
Can't wait to see the Shiba Inu in full Unreal Engine glory.
How I wish they recycled here the voice over of James from the original Silent Hill 2.
Game like this makes you want to get a PS5 lol
I never thought i will see SH 2 with better graphics.. Can we have SH 4 pls!
lets gooo
Guys is this true?  Guys somebody tell me it's true ... that I'm going home .... after 20 years ... 😭😭😭 I'm going home ...
u know i was bouta buy the original on ps2... glad i dont have to anymore :) old games are just too janky for me usually but i love the look and the vibe of them.
EXCLUSIVE??????????............
This looks great but Konami still dogshite
I really like the dark and dull atmosphere
why does James look so fckn weird
I'm sorry but the character models are a complete fail for me... that's not James
Зашибись. Конечно же эксклюзив((( ненависть
where's P.T silent hill
James!!!!!
Every remake should use next engine like unreal 5... Not 4.5 or 4.7.
Silent Hill 2 is about depression, guilt, and punishment and how it all affects a human being.  People need to read into that before saying the trailer makes James "too emotional".
but cry because Xbox buy COD
I really hope this game sells a several million of copies so that the future remakes can be guaranted
Finna load up Shattered Memories on my Ps2
JAAAAAAAAAAAAAMES! PYRAMID HEAAAAAAAD!!!!! YEEEEEEEEES! This alone makes me want to get a PS5!!!
we need a FarCry 2 Remake like this 2 GTA 3 no that remastered BS and so many others game including Resident evil 4
is this real?!
Great ps2 game ❤2
Hmmm...I don't know, I think this is not te SH we are waiting for... O_O
Ok
Kind of skeptical but if they do well, and they do have Akira Yamaoka on board, this will be amazing.
Hubieran puesto al James más joven como realmente era, aunq eso hiciera que se pareciera como leon Kennedy, de ya saben cuál.
Leon Isekaid
"I know what you are.....I know why I needed you....." ohhhh boy.....new dialogue that isn't necessary....like at all.
They can only retread
Silent Hill 2 remake with the original composer doing music? Count me in, so hyped!
wth is this sh8t bring kojima and norman reedus back you studip konami
Uhhh pyramid head back at it again 🤣
We will miss Lisa tho
I must be the only one who thinks these graphics and art style look terrible.  The ps2 original actually looks way better artistically and while graphically dated, didn't look like everything was coated in a glossy sheen of Vaseline.
Still cant get a freaking ps5!!
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
bloober team dev
Silent Hill simplemente la mejor saga de Survival Horror !
what about a remake of the original?
몽둥이로 몹 뚜들기는 모션보고 불안해졌다 이블위딘급으로 나올거같음
what's the track at 2:30 ? It's driving me crazy
Welcome home
Olha ele vindoo
shout out to my man red pyramid thing
😴😴😴
Graficamente non mi dice niente
Only PlayStation?
This and Silent Hill f. Yes!!!!!!
Don’t like that face.
I don't have ps5 but it looks cool
I am not prepared to see Pyramid Head get it on in crystal clear graphics
I just want a team silent back
it reminds me of P.T. anyone remember that teaser?
My hopes are bigger than James chin
we did it gentlemen, we lived enough to see the day silent hill would gloryously rebirth from the ashes
I love it😎
It’s Leon !
any hope that it can also be on PS4? 🙏
This gives me violent chills.
Whens it release date?
Contra cmoooooon'
running outta ideas? no problem, lets ruin another franchise
Looks just the way I imagined it. Just a slight probs which is James looks bit older than in the previous games and I don’t know if the devs tried make him more of a person with a history of drinking problems and I don’t if he was on a lot of meds lorewise. Also I would just like to add that the marry’s looka like was really ugly in the ps2 version that everytime there was a cutscene I couldn’t help laugh about her face.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Poor Leon thought he would be recovered from the PTS he got from raccoon incident and by renaming himself “James” , but this, is where his hope ends....
Looks like a bit of Comic Art style than the Original🤔but i like this…
It's interesting, you can tell what almost every single scene is, so this seems like mostly cutscene remakes as a teaser. Music: Sounds amazing. Dialog: Very, very bad decision to keep the dialog from the original game.
I need that M70 jacket...
I'm still waiting for naruto shippuden Ultimate ninja storm 5
"ANYWAY?" is literally going to be the difference for me
Imagine how much scarier the monsters will look with HD graphics
Wait this is a remake? Is there Silent hill 1 remake?
Жаль что для российских игроков её не будет ((((
Is this forthcoming remastering?
Resident Evil 4 remake and now silent hill 2? Horror fans finally getting a win lol.
"Bloober team" oh no...
Hopefully this gets the same treatment the RE2 remake did.
letsgoooo
One more!!! One
Can't afford the console, but trailer looks great
awesome
Ugh, it's so serious. Something tells me they're going to remove the UFO ending, and I hope so very much that I'm proven wrong.
Leon ????
Remakes of silent Hill 2 and resident evil 4? Did I fall into an alternate timeline??? 🥰🥰
exclusive sony pony
Looks and sounds awesome.  My only concern is that it almost looks like s 1 to 1 remake.  Hopefully they manage to do some new things with this too.
Сайлент Хилл - это первая игра, в которую я поиграла и которая меня влюбила в мир игр! М сейчас я вижу этот трейлер!❤
Silent hill 2 is one of the best.
“In my restless dreams, I see that town. Silent Hill. You promised you’d take me there again one day, but you never did.”
My EYES!!
Konami saw the success of Capcom's resident evil remake so they want to copy it.
Silent Hill best components were the music, atmosphere and how the horror actually meant something meaningful and personal. Hopefully they can capture that.
This game was the reason I converted to PlayStation ❤
Really hope they don't mess up this one
La escena en el espejo en play 2 nos mira al jugador epico
Wasn't expecting them to use the dialogue from such a pivotal scene
SH2 was the scariest games I ever played. The fog was the scariest part
All the dislikes are people stuck in silent hill.
Uma vergonha não terá legenda em PT desgosto !
Почему не оставили предыдущее лицо гг? Этому не сопереживаешь. Зачем показывать мельчайшие детали на панцире таракана, но при этом забыли полить пирамиду Пирамидоголового дождём? Можно либо не трогать классику, либо не осквернять её такими глупостями, а? Ведь Резидент нормально сделали, а здесь-то что?
I played and loved the original game, and I really like the visuals of this remake. Yet, I think the teaser is badly edited.
It  looks amazing. Hope it can catch the originals atmosphere. Having seen only this, it kind of looks too polished even in some areas. I wonder why they skipped SH 1. Could have been a great start.
Hopefully this gives Konami the sense to do that silent hills reboot with del toro and Norman Reedus
😍
face... FACE!... James' face... James' FAAACE.... Face again... pyramid head..
The teaser brings back so many happy memories and takes me back to my childhood <3
Ha! I hope you don’t censor it to make it more appealing for the weenie hut jr. generation everyone seems to be catering to.
Konami got sick of making remakes of Silent Hill 2 in all but name and decided to cut the pretence.
Umm we just gonna forget about part 1
For a second i thought that's Jeremy Fragrance.
This is what we need!
I hope the original soundtrack didn't get changed.
And PS4?
*2:30** song??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????*
peak
Why show pyramid head doing that? Disgusting
Music was one of best parts of this game. I hope they dont change it. Or mb make it bettrr which is hard. I have SH2 intro theme on my playlist  AKIRA YAMAOKA
A full-blown rebuild of the original would have be more welcome.  Additionally, there's irony here in that SH2 didn't actually take place in Silent Hill proper; the action was confined to a south shore neighborhood called South Vale and a hotel outside the town limits.
We live in the age of remakes
I’ve been waiting a very long time for this moment I only hope that this game is just as amazing as the original because I don’t think it could surpass it
I cannot wait for this remake. Silent Hill 2 is one of my favorite games of all time, and Angela is one of my favorite side characters in horror. I can't wait to have my heart ripped out and stomped on all over again.  "There was a hole here... It's gone now."
😱
Jeremy fragrance
I hope it just a literal remake. Not FF7 remake style.
the only thing that catch my attention was the nurse (not to be a pendencule) lets see
💋
this is paint it, black?
No horror game beats Silent Hill
Looks like Konami finally got tired of being shat on by Capcoms resident evil for the last 5 years. Now all they need to bring back is castlevania 🙏😤
🙄🤔
METAL GEAR SOLID REMAKE!!!!!
That piano is so melancholic
Wow Konami are making real games again
Lots of profile pic thirst trap bots commenting.
Finally I get to play the one series I never played on ps2/ps3. I remember as a kid seing these silent hill game at my local gamestop and thinking it looked too creepy and scary😅 I regret never trying
Legendas pt br por favor
Coisa Boa!
Welcome back SILENT HILL!!!!!!
They better add the dog ending
Silent hill without kojima? Hm
my old friend pyramid head
Resident 4 remake gameplay look promissing and this piece of art. great time.
Please ignore this comment, this is mine scream of soul.   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I cannot feel excited about this after Konami axed Kojima's _Silent Hills_ project 8 years ago, removing _P.T._ from the PS Store and ended up dishing out a dang plinko game in place of that. I won't buy into the hype & am perfectly content with the finely aged PS2 physical copy I still have. We've seen how remakes/reboots/remasters mostly end up as obvious cash grabs nowadays & I have extremely little faith in Konami here.
Just tell us WHEEEEENNNN
This must be a dream.........
Conan O brien searches for wife in silent hill
IT CAN'T BE, I LOVED THIS GAME AS A CHILD
Where is silent hill 1 this is 2.
Whats with all the smutty cam girls profiles making comments on here?
Silly question. Why no SH1 remake and then SH2?
I missed OG Silent Hill remake or are they just doing 2?
Finally I’ve been waiting so long for this, hopefully it lives up to expectation.
Top ...
IM IN!!!!I told myself I’ll never go back after I beat this in 2008 but im going back to silent hill this trailer is amazing 🥺🔥🔥
This trailer makes this game look terrible.
*'Rites of Judgement activates'*
Metal Gear Solid could be remembered too, Konami! 😢
This must be the worst trailer I have ever seen in my life.
Dbd with a gun 1:54
They aged his face a lot
Não consigo sair daqui
The king of Psychological horror is back!
Fox Mulder?
And here I thought they completely abandoned silent hill
Excelente
me who doesn't have a ps5: finally, i've been waiting for this my whole life
Японцы делают вещи

El tráiler se ve fome espero que el juego no sea lo mismo 👎
Creepiest game ever made, one of my all time favourites.  Absolutely can’t wait for this.
I *REALLY* hope there's a modding community for this game that's just as dedicated as the modding community for Resident Evil 2 Remake. They could fix James face, Maria's outfit, and make Pyramid Head grimier like he was in the original.
Trailer be like, "Here's James' face. Look at it, get used to it."
Back to psp days🥹🥹🥹
James looks weird...
Coisa linda, coisa formosa
Worst trailer ever
cuando salga en xbox lo comprare inmediatamente pero.... siento que el 1 necesitaba más un remake que el 2 aunque igual joya
So so so amazing. My favorite Silent Hill game
SILENT HILL 1 REMAKE, PLEASE
Is this only i think or this charactor look like resident evil 4 leon
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bloober Team! Their last game was very Silent Hill-like, so I'm not surprised they were picked up for this project.
They better leave the dog ending in 😅
What's with his face ?
Me just sitting here in the corner, sulking, and hoping that Xenogears or Legend of Dragoon gonna get its remake : 😢 someday…someday….
dont give me a hope again
Never thought we'd see this series again
Looks amazing
The original SH2 is still playable and beautiful this remake looks awful !
So what happen to the other silent hill for ps4?
Am really excited for the remake but what about silent hills 😢 A 15 mins playable teaser that changed the world of horror games and they don’t even consider to revive it
Blooper Team making Capcom look inexperienced lol This is all in-engine on Unreal 5
they better have the original mysic
They're putting alot of pressure on themself with this. Hopefully its gonna live up to the name
0:07 PS4 cockroach
I'd rather Tango Gameworks develop the remake. They have a better track record
Tenian que hacer un remake del silent hill 1 que es el mejor silent hill de todos
Why'd they make him look so gruff???😭😭
I'm excited considering the OG is my favorite horror game I just hope they can live up to the OG...
Cada vez amo mas este trailer!
just my dream in one gmae
Leon get his retirement and go to silent hill universe.
Bloober team, lol zero faith in this game
I hope it comes out for the PS4 to 🙏🏻
The true ending should be here. And yes it's the Doge ending.
Pachinko machine here i come
Silient hill 2 Pachinko harder the game
This game better be so scary that I have to quit at a certain point until I recuperate my self enough to play it until it’s finished, just like PT did lol
Im buying this game💀
Estará disponible para PC?
Why not on PS4?
Yes this DEFINITELY means we might get a new generation of scared people
All that effort on character hair and then when he falls to his knees and looks down, that awesome hair is stationary and gravity defying.
wow. holy shet
A quién realmente he esperado mucho tiempo es a Harry Mason y Cheryl.
It's so nice to see these games advertised on a system that over 2 years later we can still can't get.
PUEDO MORIR EN PAZ
Me habria encantado una pequeña frase del monologo de Maria al comienzo del trailer. Con el comentario final... "I'm not your Mary"
Bro what definitely getting this
Haven’t played a single silent hill games. I’ll surely try this one
Bloober team ?? Woof
Not Bloober Team. I really don't like their games.
Mary or Meryl?
Wow.... I just realised that the developer team working on this is the original developer on silent hill 2. Just wow
Just hope they fox.that terrible camera
Espetáculo
Console Exclusive. Pfff. I thought we were past this. Well at least it is a timed exclusive.
Why make something new when your company can just ruin Silent Hill 2 over and over and over again? Because you guys did such a great job the last time you were trusted to update SH2, with that HD Collection. I can't imagine any fan will actually fall for this again
Pleasedon'tfuckitupPleasedon'tfuckitupPleasedon'tfuckitupPleasedon'tfuckitupPleasedon'tfuckitupPleasedon'tfuckitupPleasedon'tfuckitupPleasedon'tfuckitup
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
People forgot... that Silent Hill is the place where dreams come true... now it's back, it's reality!
Back to my teenage years.
Finally something exciting in the gaming industry for the past three years
Let's hope they don't forget the ufo ending...
Where is mgs remake ?
Silent Hill > Resident Evil
1:04 wow they nailed the fog, looks great
I'm big fan of silent hill 2 this game will be awesome ありがとうございました, konami 🇯🇵😇
Yaaay🎉🎉
😍😍🔥🔥🔥
Maybe now I will embrace the next gen flop
There’s no way
so... blooper all along
Will this be on ps4 as well?
This game gives me nightmares. Now i want to face my ptsd again
Can’t believe they got Akira Yamaoka on the game again!! One of the best composers ever
silent hill is one of the most emotionally sad and dark games of all. the atmosphere of sadness and hopelessness in it emanates from everything, even from the color scheme and sound accompaniment. and also this game can be said to have founded a surreal type of horror within the framework of video games.
Doge ending will be wild
Loving James' updated looks  he shows more expression and  doesn't look like a gremlin
I still have my copy of 2 and I am pumped for this.
Finally, a reason to get scalped on Ebay or by CEX for a £700 playstation 5... LOL
13 reasons why: Restless Dreams
Hold your expectations because if they use old code base graphics will not blow ur mind. In trailer low textures can be seen. But let's hope for the best.
Please don't make James look like that, it's so ugly, looks so wrong compare to the PS2 character.
I cried when I watched this ..
I feel happy and worried at the same time..
I hate his hair but the game looks brilliant
Ps4
Announce P.T.
> No the Theme of Laura in the opening Guys, you had one job
00:35 goosebumps... FREAKIN GOOSEBUMPS!!! WWOOOAAAHHHHHHH!!!
Y el remake del 1?????????
Make new games instead
On a side note, are we gonna ignore the fact this comment section is filled with fake spam cam girl accounts?
Can’t believe they still got the scene were pyramid Head and the nurses are getting down in the kitchen.
Thought it was forgotten
Looks surprisingly great, but I fear they might make it too actiony.
Looks like the typical modern gaming approach of cliched Hollywood formulaic visuals and storytelling.  These people will never understand what the original Team Silent were actually doing. Fancy graphics won't makeup for the deficit in unique emotive experience.
Exclusivo de ps5 y tiene gráficos del gta 5 ps3
AKHIRNYA KONAMI WARAS
95% of the PS5 games are remakes and it's continue
pyramid head!
Вечная игра
Ooo, Pyramid head's back 😳😯 Looks great. They've recaptured the isolated and hellish tension filled atmosphere of the older games. Take notes Capcom, instead of belching out crappy remakes that feel cheap and thoughtless 👉
do i need to have played the original to understand this?
nah, we want p.t.
Well Silent Hill was the reason I bought a PS1. SILENT HILL 2 (and GTA III) was the reason I bought a PS2. I guess I found a reason to purchase a PS5 now
Leon now works for Konami
The best game on earth, bar none. (Chinese games go eat sh  it)
Well this is crack.
YES PLEASE
A console exclusive for 12 months 😂. Playstation is the worst thing in the gaming industry.
please use the original voices! they were better
Silent Hill
I'm glad this is coming out now. If only Konami did not mess things up with Hideo Kojima, imagine all the MGS remakes we would be getting now too.
Eating pizza in a town that is full of monsters Now in HD
The new James looks like Liam Neeson.
Наконец то ! Надеюсь не обосрутся  "Конами" с канонами😂
This looks like one of those UE asset flips lol
Aaaallright, now I actually need to get myself a Ps5
This Remake is so big that even Spam Account's are breaking character in the comments
it would be amazing the option to play it with the original soundtrack
It's fitting that Capcom got them interested in making a survival horror game, and Capcom likely had a lot to do with them coming back to the series. I do however, advise cautious optimism.
GIVE US PES 2023.
ich konnte vor langer zeit das alte silent hill 2 für den pc über bittorrent runterladen, welches ohne extra disc lauffähig war UND ICH IDIOT HABE ES GELÖSCHT!!!
This is a dream
is this the one that has a shiba inu ending?
I suddently need a ps5
Does not look like a UE5 game
It was yesterdaay when i played this on my PS2.
Неужели...
Legendas pt br
If the OST doesn't include Theme of Laura and Promise, I don't want it.
Nice, but where is SILENT HILLS??
That ost of the movie... 👌🏻
Ну хз
sheesh  ICANT WAITTT
i think sh2 remake looks like twin peaks which is really cool and james really looks like david lynch which is cool too
Hair animation 🤮

Ps3 gráficos
silent hill 2 is a master piece best horror game for me because its different from most horror games its stirs up all of your emotion psychologically when u play it each time u think u kinda relate to this game and u become really focused with the stories, the characters and the gameplay thats why its the best game for me and for alot of ppl bcz there is no game that are fit for the description of sh2 i have written above, i hope this remake is great because silent hill fans have been waiting for a decade for konami to release a new game (i dont doubt konami for a second that they're gonna make this game look bad) and i hope they release silent hill 1 remake too,  i am so excited that most ppl childhood game and my too came back after 20 years that its popular so the new generation can expierence this game in better graphics and design
its the same actor from resident evil 4
Konami saw Capcom revived old RE and thought "I can do that too"
1:54 isn't that a mgsv sound effect?
yes, YES, YEAS!!! AHHHHH!!!!
The only way to redeem themselves if Konami can make a change in the company itself, treat their own workers with respect and maturity, and bring back Hideo Kojima to the front to bring MGS to live. It can be their redemption arc.
This remake will be amazing 😁😁😁
Konami:"we can't rely on PES this year it's all going down *hill* ....wait a minute..."
Whats with his face ? So many strange emotions …
Never played a silent hill game but always liked the concept. Considering picking this up
oh man! I think I have to buy a PS5 now ..
This looks amazing!
Мои глаза больше не будут болеть от постоянного напряжения! Ура!!!!
I'm just glad that this beautiful moment happened
Please release a proper HD Collection finally, original classic SH games deserve to be widely accesible.
member P.T guys?
Hearing some Silent Hill fans moaning bout this only being on PS5 for a year, atleast you've ONLY got to wait ONE YEAR for the game to come out on your preferred system. How bout us fans of Fallout and Elder Scrolls games, possibly no longer getting anymore Bethesda titles on PS5 due to Xbox now owning Bethesda!?
Взагалі не зрозуміло, як це грається, але дуже цікаво)
There is something about James looks that i really like, and he looks very warned down and tired which is normal cause of the stress of his wife's death and heading back to Silent Hill for answers.
Опять
Looks iconic. I was always afraid to play as a little kid but now I'm a grown up haha 😅 let's do this 💪🏼
Whaaaaat
Amazing, thank you for making it possible to relive this memory in a refurbished state
"In my restless dreams, I see that town... Silent Hill"
These games are better in the third person!
i hope they make movie again about this game
We need mgs 6 😭😭😭😭
Remake silent hill 2 but not the original silent hill? this will confuse the new generation...then again game developers these days have no more original ideas so they rehash their successful ip and people still gobble it anyway heh
Leon?
Hospital scene always the scarery one
I've played it before but not ps made So graphics 1kx
Brad is going to be so happy lol…
What a lame trailer
omfg again with these remasters. dont you have any imagination to make something new other than just making graphics for old games????
Ps5 only? What about ps4? 😭
Still not buying a ps5
well, finally our dreams are going to come true.
Lo hicieron exclusivo por un año... Y luego anda Sony llorándole a medio mundo para que Xbox no compre Activision.
Re 4 and silent hill coming out ..  what year is it ?
I probably went through all the horror games from every indie consumer goods to little-known Japanese games of the 90s. but I still think silent hill is one of the darkest and most oppressive games. fear in this game is unique it's sluggish suspense creeping, they barely use Boo! effects, but at the same time, silent hill is scarier than games built on this effect.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This 1:03
If any game is worth getting a PS5 for it’s this one for me. I’m ready to return to the town we have all seen in our restless dreams, Silent Hill 🙌
Never played any of the games but this looks kinda bad ngl
silent hill 2 looks amazing
Please, do the whole series!!!!
Ik everyone's excited BUT HEY ITS KONAMI
Peccato che la PS5 sia una consolle inesistente ed introvabile, per cui mi domando per quale motivo continuino ad uscire videogames per una consolle che nessuno ha e non si riesce tutt'ora ad acquistare in un negozio, come tutte le altre consolle...
Yasssss!!!
It can't be REAL... O.o
Plz let me Maria be Cameron Diaz again .
it's great to see konami still remember silent hill
It's going to be bad.
Моя любимая часть, очень жду! =)
Hey!! Something to play on my PS5. I'm a fan. Loved the original game.
Whoa seriously what happen to KONAMI ?
I can't believe it, one of my favorite games of all time. I have been saying for years how this series needs to come back and especially SH2 needs a remake. Feels like a dream come true.
They did the fog of Silent Hill justice ❤️‍🔥
That's it. I'm getting a ps5 no matter what. The original game was an amazing sequel and solidified my love for the series and this looks so amazing.. I have a lump in my throat because the emotion I feel for this is so raw. I was hoping that someday Konami would brihg silent hill back and they did it in the best way. I have high hopes for this remake and if it proves to be a success again then hopefully they will remaster the entire original series and perhaps bring from something new and never been told.
I can't wait
Sembra Vercelli
For ps4 plisss
Nowadays teens will learn what real horror is.  Welcome to silent hill
Remedy would've been perfect choice for a Silent Hill remake or a new Silent Hill game with them and art from Ikumi Nakamura with music from Ryuichi Sakamoto ...ugh..so perfect.
loooo mejoooorrr 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩...mas que recordar a mi ex.
Джеймс стал похож на азиата..( я настолько привык к его старому образу. А тут смотрю, вроде он, а вроде и не он уже..
I have a new reason to live again.
ITS FINALLY HAPPENING!!!!
Where is part 1?
they canmake the hands look better
Eu sendo viúvo de Silent Hill por 10 anos, quando me toca "Magdalene" no começo, fiquei igual pinto no lixo, meu Deus eu preciso demais desse jogo.
Here we go again :D
Finally, a remake that is worth it. in my restless dreams, i see that town, silent hill.
I want to see angela and laura again
Sebastian fans 👍🏻
Super!!!
ITS A YES FROM ME
i can't wait
This will be great for the 17 people in America that have a PS5!
En pc es necesario tener una rtx 2080 para jugarlo a 1080p en graficos medios o altos a 30 fps saludos 🖖
Beautfull!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH eu tô maluco
I thought bloober team said that they were not developing silent hill when fans asked. Looks like fans were spot on.
Why no love for *Silent Hill 1* : (
Silent Hill 4 remake next please🎉
Just hearing Magdalene gives you goosebumps.
I´m very skeptical about this. This needs to be properly done.
2 Weeks before launch Konami: Cancel the launch, cancel SH
a masterpiece
Pyramid Head, can't wait to see it
02:20 does anyone know what this music is? Is it a rendition of Silent Hill 1 theme ? Or did this actually exist in the OG Silent Hill 2?
"I wish I hadn't designed fxxkin Pyramid Head"
Will this be ported to pc ?
You know, they might have done several dozen takes for all these expressive scenes. They might have shown only the very expressive compositions for this trailer, and could possibly use different/calmer takes for the real game, if there was too much fan backlash as a result of this trailer.
أخيرا شيء حصري اسطوري . شكرا كونامي 🤎
This is an amazing time to be a survival horror fan. SH2 remake happening, RE8 DLC releasing soon, RE4 remake coming in March, new Silent Hill games announced. It's beautiful!
I can already tell... this ain't it, chief.
finally!!!
Bruh why it's not on ps4?
There's literally no info about this game on the ps store... Sometimes I wonder what Sony is thinking
Garbage game, bring back Castlevania instead, FUCKonami
Ахуенно! русские привет  (:
Almost thought the voice actor was Mathew McConaughey for a second haha
So excited ! Can’t wait to play it
I’ve never got to play this so pretty stoked
コナミ、覚醒
Will be there UFO ending?
Now my life will be complete!
Would it still have the Doge shiba inu alternate ending?
Sony and KONAMI, please do not let Bloober Team bloob.
Говно-плавфома
I can't wait for the new Theme of Laura
Deveriam fazer remake do SH1 e 3
No ****ING way.
And now every game developers trying to make remake, after the success of Capcom Resident Evil
Konami is back.
I recently talked about Silent Hill 2 again and how nice it would be if they remaked it along with SH1 and SH3.  One of the best games ever
P.T ?
why does he talk like batman?
Pyramid head was trying to poke somethin
es hermoso ❤️🔥
I can already tell they're going to tone down the sXual aspects of the game. They're changing the Pyramid Head scene so that he's *NOT* having sX with the mannequins and they're changing Maria's outfit so that she completely covered. 😒 Lame.....
i doubt this game will ever come...
Metal Gear Solid 1 Remake next?
Cool and all, but you know all we wanted was PT
It's so great! Can't wait to get back to Silent Hill😍
Just port the original games to modern system.
Konami. Legendas pt br
The vibe seems very off and James did you get a facelift?
Para  cuando sale ala venta al publico?
This will obviously be canceled only to be replaced by SILENT HILL SURVIVE soon after.
i thought we were supposed to hate Konami?  Make up your mind guys,  it's hard to keep up.
One of the best games ever made
Is it going to be like P.T. ?
What about Silent Hill 1?
played the original once and finished it, now im eager for this
Now, Squaresoft or SquareEnix, please bring back Parasite Eve and Xenogears!
I’m going to be really annoying to everyone within earshot when this drops
Tiembla y llora residenremakes evil
*prays for no cut content*
Por fin!! ha sido una larga espera.
finally a remake of silent hill 2 one of the best games everfinally a remake of silent hill 2 one of the best games ever 🔥
This gave some goosebumps. I was like 10 when I played this and the horror moments are still in ma head like it was yesterday. I'm 24 now and I'm going back in!!!!!!
ojala traiga el codigo Konami uwu
Surely it cant be worse than the HD collection…right?
Should have been SH1, but that's just me.
Continuo aqui
So... you remake a game from 2 but not from 1!? Smells like pandering for suckers.
Y el primer juego?
JOJOJOJOOJOJOJO. LO QUE SE VIENE, JODERRRRRRRRR.
Hi Jenny. See ya.
Main characters looks doesnt match the hair and body something has to change dude looks like an ugly leon rip off than a dad-regular joe type fellow. 彼の顔を変えてください ^_^
bloober games = FAIL
Konami is finally feeling desperate
*"Whaaa! How dare Microsoft buy Activision, COD BETTER stay Multiplatform"* -Sony Ponies Also Sony Ponies *"Haha! We got Silent Hill 2 (Timed Exclusive) eat it Xbots* Seems Sony fans don't know the meaning of HYPOCRISY
Si theme of laura no suena en el juego tomaremos jerusalen
alright, who asked for this?
You f,ed it up, no part 1 lol ok
*sigh*
Hipócritas
Definitivamente, es cine, digo, es videojuego 😎🤌
I tried playing on PS3 the other day and the gameplay is kinda wonky, hard to feel immersed.  The music is great though. I'm sure it would have felt different 20 years ago.  Excited for the remake
Necrophilia. Again.
AWESOME
The scariest thing about this is that it’s Konami
I know I'm in the minority here, but I always prefered the SH games that dealt with the mistery behind the town itself(the cult and stuff), so I really hope they remake the other games too.
Looks like I've finally got an excuse to buy an up to date console...
UF
в Сайлент ни разу как не радоваося когда дверь не открывалась ЫЫ юю Пирамидальгного так и не прошел  плейку подчал в месте
Now I want a PS5
The roach at the beginning instantly reminded me of P.T.  And just made me sad during the whole announcement… lol
We make remakes because all new games are3 Woke infested messes
Bloober Team to jest bardzo trudne zadanie ,kultowy i chyba najlepszy horror ,który kiedykolwiek powstał ,poprostu nie spieprzcie tego :)
im waiting outlast trials
😍😍😍😍
No way they did
Espero no lo cancelen
PS4 and ps5 ❤🎉❤
pyramid head is waiting for you
I like how it has the same piano progression as the movies.
"Just like that stupid dog. He had it coming too!"
Mil veces si
words cannot explain my joy rn
no way
Konami had made my favorite Nes games, glad to see this name again.
Anyone else hear the Paint it Black notes?
Yes! Finally. I hope we get Norman Reedus Silent Hill someday
I can't express how happy I am. A remake of one of the greatest games of all time!
someone needs to do a "blooper" reel of pyramid head dinging the top of his helmet on the doorway, ala Storm Trooper
If they ruin this game im gonna f**k their mo-
Silent Hill: Shattered Memories i remeber this gam for me was just wow and i was young i love silent hill.
Looks bad tbh, the hands are also looking very weird and bad compared to the face which probably is made with metahuman, aka lazyness.
💜
I am crying , I love this game
If Blooper pulls this off, .. I'm not blown away by their pixilation and concerned the end will change. There for it, though!
Unfortunately I slept on the entire Silent Hills series.. I can't wait to play
WOIII INI SERIUSSS ?????? AWAS KALO GK JADI LAGI
Shattered memories please 🙏🙏
Oh no they made him hot on a serious note this looks awesome
Dino crisis remake plis
🌟🌟🌟
KABOOOM!
omfg
Not sure how i feel about this
Those closeups of his face look terrible
Is hedeo kojima the director her??
I can see this being a masterpiece just like Resident Evil 2 Remake.
If the new cinematics, voice acting, and music maintain this quality through even half of the game-- it's gonna be worth it. It's all gonna be worth it 😍We may not have Kojima & Del Toro, but no doubt their memory remains with this franchise forever now. I hope Bloober goes with great passion for the material!
Que super!😏
No ps4 release? Lame
I'm ready to go back!
I like
So is nobody going to talk about that he Kinda looks like an Old Version of Leon from Resident Evil, and he's also looking for a Loved one the same way Ethan was in Resident Evil 7, seems Silent Hill Took inspiration from Resident Evil.
Hype !!!
Brasil pt br
Resident evil got nothing on silent hill
Overrated game tbh
Uhuuuuuu
They better make pyramid head confusing and horrific again. It really is exciting to see Silent hill getting the attention it deserves.
PT reference with the cockroach
Pt  br
Постарел он чет
Looks like more love was put in the re remakes.
Data
why dint yaw do something about the p.t one, people would love it if yaw made that game
Can we also get a Siren Blood Curse remake or a new entry to the series? 😬
Silent Hill 2 - Teaser Trailer | PS5 Games
I love the actor's potrayal of the character, he looks broken, sad, and just looks like a pathetic misanthrope of a human being
Where in Maine is Silent Hill?
P.T cancelation still give me PTSD
I still don't know why PT's cockroach still looks much better than this remake. Still take me back to Silent Hill!
cool, but the games i m Waiting for are GOW RAGNAROK LAST OF US3
ps5 greatest remakes
gacor
Se fudeo souzza ;-;
Finalmente kraio
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Konami : "impossible? lol yeah.....now your move gamers"
James face looks like a caucasian got mixed with an asian and it looks weird.
James’ hands…why do they look like that? They 😊couldn’t get his hands down…look at the part in the trailer when he grabs the noose, his left hand. The fingers, the weird swelling bulge. After you’ll notice through your the trailer there just odd looking.
Hummmm radio 📻  I wonder what's wrong with that radio
im concerned its by blooper team, gotta admit. so far they havent really proved themselves in the gameplay side of things.
No way this is real
If I was one of those rich hotel chain owners I would make a replica of the Lake View Hotel, complete with the Music Box. I have no idea where I would find such a device, but it would be worth looking.
ooo yes ...
do not change anything except graphics game was perfect and terrifying.
Thanks Konami 😢😢😢😢
Can’t stop watching this
I cried
James new look 🤢👎🏻
If Koonami is bringing back "Silent Hill" then there's hope that we could see a remake of "Castlevania: Symphony of the Night" in the near future.
Remasters and remake is the New area of gaming ! but we need new ideas as well anyway...
When will it be released?
🙏📖
Konami get the money from my master duel addiction.
It's games like this that are my child hood, is the reason i play games
Feels wrong not seeing Kojimas name up there
🤍💛
After a long restless dream..   it's finally happening.
James Sunderland: I’m ready. Us: Yeah, but are we?
I had to re-watch the trailer a few times just to make sure I wasn't dreaming.
I am crying watching this. 🤤🤤. This is like going back in time. I suddenly feel like a kid again. In this modern gaming world, nothing makes me feel like then.
don't disappoint us all Bloober Team Make Team Silent Proud
Pyramid head..back where he belongs
Never played the og silent hill but definitely wanna play this it'll be a great experience
When finally 2 legends return (Resident evil & silent Hill) you know this is the greatest times to be a horror games fans
never been so hyped for an game
I remember playing silent hill 2 when it came out back then. I was fine before playing. but I remember it started haunting me it started playing with me more than I played with it. there is nothing much horrifying in this game no much jumpscares no loud noises  but there is something so depressing so sad so dark in silent hill 2 I started to talk less stay alone in my room  It was like I was depressed this game really affected me for like a whole month till it ended and a few days after.
Nem lançou o 1 vai direto pro 2?
Why tf does this game require GTX 1080 as minimum? It looks like a game that can easy run 60 fps on a GTX 1060.
mas e o 1? eu preciso disso também pfv
5/10
Game yg bikin saya mimpi buruk...  Next Remake Dino Crisis 1&2 please
Sorry, it’s been cancelled
우악 제임스 썬더랜드씨 오랫만이야 😅👋👋
Stop making remasters or remakes. Please do something new and original ffs
My only problem is James face.. Its just not that James...
To all new players. Make sure you knock on all the bathroom stall doors… you get a really cool uhh… powerup… for doing it👹👻
Why James look like Markiplier?
I want silent hill 4 remake
I want silent hill 1 remake
Konami: legendas pt br
Silent hill 2 was my childhood's nightmare, i can't wait to play it on my ps5
Finally Konami is on right track.
Hate James voice actor
YEEEEEEEEEEEEAHHH
Re4 SH2 same haircut same fight same horror
I'm not sure about that one tbh
I like bloober games, but a little worried about how they will do combat, there is literally none In  their games.
All these people complaining about the missing "subtle" expressions of the original game... Shut the f*ck up. Ito and the Blooper Team are working hard to make this game. You can clearly see it's not going to be a lazy remake, but a full-of-passion project with a slightly different tone. As the SH2 original creators said, you people are thinking way too much into this.
Now watched it a few times and Bloober has turned James into a typical gruff protag when the entire point of James was to be a completely unspecial guy who has been shut off from his emotions (and indeed his recollection of events). The almost disconnected acting in the original wasn't just to aim for something Lynchian, it was to show how cut off James is, from others but especially from himself. I'm getting none of that from this trailer. Indeed, rather than show how special and unique SH2 is, this just plays out like any generic horror film trailer.  I dunno how Bloober keeps getting projects because their handling of horror is dreadful (especially when it comes to mental health).
Got the PS4 for the PT demo…..now I will be getting a PS5 for this
On veut la musique culte du film dans le jeu
insaaaaane !!
They should have remade SH1...
I wonder if theyll let us go into the Church of the Rebirth
Nossa, estou muito empolgado para jogar, mas e vier sem legendar ptbr infelizmente não vou comprar o jogo.
I've lost count how many times I repeated this trailer, this is pure art, the atmosphere, the unknown, the depression, the music! Everything done right in this trailer. Can't wait for the game, hope it gets a 2023 release date.
I just can say thank you Konami
To all the naysayers: No, James is NOT looking at the player in the original game during the mirror scene. It's been officially confirmed by Ito.
I was never able to finish a Silent Hill game. These are are the epitome of scared sh@tless 😂😂😂
Fix James' face. It looks like he's having an allergic reaction to a bee sting
7 or 8 years and pt still looks better
THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD!!
Honestly brings me to tears.. this game is undoubtedly the best game of all time and it’s past due that this masterpiece gets retold for newer audiences.
Por que solo para Playstation? Que ladilla de verdad
I used to play this game after dinner when I was 14. Oh the memories
i'm really intrigued on how they're going to portray angela, particularly the daddy boss and the staircase scene
Why a remake. Jus drop a new game
all these remakes coming out and finally i get to experience it with my favourite game :') i'm so excited!!
Amazing news! Waiting for it! Never thought that this can be made, i'm really happy, i'm an old school Silent Hill fan :) The game looks fantastic!
As a jaded Konami fan I’m definitely skeptical. All I can say is I’m glad they’ve finally come to their senses.
Can’t wait to buy this game for myself only to inevitably force my boyfriend to play it for me while I watch because I’m too scared to actually play it myself
Now it's time for the metal gear solid     please 🥲🥲🥲✌️
magnifico
I prefer classic horror games like when we lost on steam
I literally feel like I'm in a dream with all of these Silent Hill updates.  It's definitely been worth the many many years I've been waiting.  THANK YOU KONAMI!!!!
Can’t wait for the Silent Hill 2 Remastered Pachingo machine 😂
YES!!! Is Perfect!!!
I can't believe
Gonna play in 30 FPS
if you want to make exclusive go make your own franchise and please dont do this to the game we rise up with. i dont play ps5 to play this game i just hate you more because what you did and how prefer to spend money and look just for your self and not the gamers
Can't wait man
No theme of Laura song ? The music in this game are dope and we get nothing on the trailer?
ремейк делается людьми которые сделали посредственный Блэйр Витч, жиденький лайерс оф феар 2 и нудный медиум. По моему конами решили показать, как не надо делать ремейки.
Holy F..K . Take my Money!!!!!
Does anyone know the song that’s on 0:02-0:30 ?
wait but where is silent hill 1 ?
This pachinko machine is gonna be lit
for official trailer, all they need to do is match Theme of Laura with remake graphics and the pre-orders will be rolling in.
doesn't really look that scary is the problem, too clean and colorful looking almost like they just going for another The Medium instead of silent hill 2
shame we will never know what kind of silent hill we would of got with PT
Ладно слух был что сайлент хилл блуберам отдадут, это было очевидно. Они умеет хорроры с интересной историей делать, надеюсь и с СХ всё будет хорошо
This is my childhood game, pls don't ruin it Konami
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHY THEY ARE MAKING A REMAKE OF SILENT HILL 2…BEFORE SILENT HILL 1? I’m confused
The best horror game is back boys
He looks like leon but old version 🤣🤣🤣
Ohhh yeah!!!! Thank you very much Konami and Sony.
I never played the original, so hopefully the remake is decent
awesome 👌👏
Dog ending had better still be there!
2:45 his hat went through the door frame lol
GOAT
I never thought I’d see Konami remember they have franchises outside of Yugioh
Silent hill 1 remake where?
Why? What happened whit Silent Hill 1?
We need this Game  and  we are waiting for  👍👍👍👍
no ma meeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssss
James is supposedly running away from his guilt, escaping reality.
冒頭、いきなりGのアップで始まる映像センスにがっかりしました。このトレーラーを見る限り、正直言って期待よりも不安の方が大きいです。SH２は熱心なファンが多い作品です、独り善がりなものは作らないようにお願いします。
I want this OST so bad now
I really don't think this a remake. I think it's a sequel to silent hill 2
My life has a purpose again
Dios nunca he estado tan emocionado AAAAAAAA DIOS GRACIAS
SH 1 to 3 masterpiece
I Was hoping that kojima  finsh silent hill with Norman Reedus
If all the original soundtracks are placed in the same cut scenes and gameplay, especially the truth scene, this remake will become legendary in an instant.
Remakes de Silent Hill e Resident Evil sendo fiel ao jogo original era tudo que esse geração precisava para saber o que é jogo bom de verdade!
School Shooting in Japan 🖕
I hope this is Also coming to Xbox. I know very little about Silent Hill Besides Pyramid Head.
I wish they went with a more soft, grimy aesthetic. Something they could still even achieve by changing up their post-processing alone. We have the power to make it look just like the pre-rendered scenes of the original, but better. That should be the bar for such an amazing game SH2 is.
Leon with from resident evil to silent Hill 😂
Ps4 ?
Ps4?
Ps4?
Ps4?
WHERE IS MGRR 2
is it just me or does James mocap actor look like the guy that did William Birkin in the RE2 Remake
James honey, Did something happen to you? After we got separated in that long hallway? Unfortunately I can't justify buying a PS5 for Silent Hill 2 and I love Silent Hill 2 a lot.
I thought the music was "glimpse of us"
i cant wait
I don't have nostalgia for Silent Hill 2. But I did play it this year, and has been stuck with me ever since. They somehow managed to make a game that despite it's terrifying atmosphere, it draws me to come back to the town, as if I'm being called to it. I hope this remake manages to capture that same feeling I got when playing the original one
James' face looks odd to me. It looks like they just tried to make a Japanese man look Caucasian.
The resemblance should be as close as possible to the characters models from the original cgi cutscenes
The cg trailers visuals from the original ps2 game should of been The target render For This remakes in game engine.
Im look for the song that starts at 2:29 and end around 2:37, unless it's unreleased, then I'm damned.
I really hope they fix the opening scene to be more like in the original. It was imo a really important one and in this trailer it's completely ruined making me worried that they will not be faithful to the original game. This remake graphics looks great but that wasn't the reason why this game was so amazing. 1. You can see James eyes looking at himself in the mirror when in the original the eyes were so dark you couldn't tell that because James wasn't looking at himself in the mirror but at the player which was so great.  2. The unusual hand gesture in front of his face in the original for me at least meant that at that moment he pretty much forgot what he did and we as a player became James (or something close to that, it felt like it had a deeper meaning not just a random weird hand gesture) where as in this trailer he just simply touches his face and it means nothing.
If there's no "Dog ending" we riot!

Virou o dia e continuo aqui
Now we know that he's not looking to us at the mirror
Gráficos de ps2 🤑🤑🤑
They should remake the original Silent Hill 2 trailer with this
Can't wait to see the burning staircase scene with Angela in next-gen graphics.
BRING BACK GUY CIHI
Watch it get cancelled...
A must buy for me no matter what
I never played the game, can someone tell me what's the title of the piano background music that played at the end?
omfg
This game really didn’t need a remake
WE WILL SEE THAT TOWN AGAIN .
They better not just make a walking simulator out of silent hill
Can’t wait to see Indeimaus play this!
can't wait~
Estuvieron esperando tanto para esta porquería?
Overrated Konami Horror Game 2: Remake  No thanks. I stay with SH1. Barely gets any love, the poor little gem.
I like a developer that take his time on making a perfect game
i dont like the face of James
Estou aqui de novo
Que exitante -0- !
james sunderland emotion, perfect...this is history
Silent Hill 2 is in the top 5 Video games of all time. This is incredible.
Why don’t I recognize the song at 2:31.. I feel dumb
I hope they dont fkd up this masterpeace..
Porque no empezar por el 1?
nani
I’ve never played silent hill before and I’ve heard so much praise, so if it’s bad I’ll be very disappointed
Why are they skipping Sillent Hill 1?
Just having Akira Yamaoka back for the music is enough of a guarantee for me that this is gonna be a solid game.
I hope they find ways to update the combat to make it fun. A lot has changed in survival horrors since then.
"Noisy Hill" anyone?
I hope that when we see Maria we could react the same way than James when he sees her
BRING GUY CIHI BACK
Ofc it won't be on PS4 -_-
Incredible how the original, a game 20 years old, looks better than a game made today. That is how timeless the artistry in the original is, no lazy greedy remake can ever change that.
Is the soundtrack from the old game will be in the remastered one? Cause I hope so
So Konami saw that Capcom was doing with the Resident Evil remakes and was like "So THAT'S how we'll bounce back"  If you're gonna copy, you better do it right.
“This town called you, too.”
Will they have this for pc too??? Would be great if it does.
His face looks so different. I love the atmosphere from silent hill but so far it is expected to be low:(
"This town is full of monsters, how can you sit there and eat pizza?!"  They better keep that line in this remake.
León, sal de ahí,  esa no es tu familia 🤣🤣🤣
We got re4 remake and silent hill 2 remake with both protagonist with the same haircut  nice 😀
<<Shame Acquired >>
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
It looks... pretty, but where's the art direction? The grittiness and weirdness looks absent. These are the things that made SH so unique and creepy.
Silent hill 2 remake y resident evil 4 remake, dos de los mejores juegos de la play 2 y de la historia. Esto es un momento histórico
is the leitmotif at the start a reference to Paint it Black? Sounded sorta like it, and would fit thematically
uuuuu Xịn nè... ráng mua ps5 thoy
2:43 poderia ser mais alto
"Eddie, you can't just kill people because of the way they look at you"
hopefully they have the weird stilted dialogue from the original
So pra ps5 ta de brincadeira ne
Nah I don't like it, I'd rather just play the original. lol
Ps4 please🙏🙏🙏
can  not wait. my all time fav horror games. brings me back..
I LOVE that they gave Harry so much expression! He really looks concerned and freaked out and devastated.
Yes, please!
Has this day really come?I just don't have the words
Konami's pullout game be strong..
Incrível
Finalmente
Bloober Team is such a flawed choice.
You cant kill somebody just because of the way they look at you
Why SH2 and not SH1? 😭
Thank you! Let’s gooooo
Don't understand why they skipped 1 and just went straight to 2 for the remake...
No way
cant belive this game gonna be only on ps5, so many sells lost, hope sh makes it to a new realease
Who would've thought I'd see the day, I've really given up all hope and dreams on Konami, but boy am I excited for this, hopefully a MGS remake is in the making next
Them roach physics 🪳🪳🪳
Господи неужели я живу в то время когда сделали ремейк шедевральной сайлент хилл 2🤩
Maybe too late for Konami to redeem themselves, but I’ll still take it.
Finally some silent hill , oh well , I guess it’s gonna be those sleepless nights and full of nightmares for me again , I’m ready
super excited for this man! not totally sure about the slightly cartoony graphics filter. Sometimes in the trailer I really notice it, other times not so much.
¡CHSM SONYERS!
bloober team?  get your hopes down folks.
This is an awesome panichko machine
Esto definitivamente pinta una sonrisa en mi rostro…
Hideo Kojima
So basically Konami is doing what capcom is doing and re-mastering games.
очень слабо
Looks ugly tbh.
50 shades of gray the game
Dont know how old was James, but here he looks like 45 year old dude...
All the games that I am looking forward to most are remakes  re4 remake silent hill 2 remake rumour of a mgs3 remake  I hope there is a mgs3 remake that was my favorite game in the series
I knew the rumors I read about many moons ago was true! Oh happy days. 😊
Lo arruinaron cuando le sacaron la sombra marcada al primer plano del principio, esa oscuridad plena era la que presentaba la oscuridad del personaje.

Welcome back to Silent Hill!  (After all years)😅
Como será q vai estar a névoa ingame do Silent Hill?
Mmmm hi def Pyramid Head bewty.
Наконец-то.... я дожил до этого дня
Only on ps5?
Too bad i finished it 2 times already, replaying it with modern graphics can be nice but it is basically the same game so its not too exciting
Now if only I could get a PS5!!🤬🤬🤬
No PC ?
0:35 this part gives me goosebumps when i saw it on the livestream
2:29 is this song from the original game it’s sounds like it was but I didn’t remember hearing it?? If not I’m very much excited because it sounds beautiful and silent hill 2 in general has a beautiful soundtrack.
gracias
I wanted to see Maria's face so badly
Hope they will not change soundtracks
Вау...

Мне не нравится его лицо. Как в оригинале лучше. Здесь он какой то действительно ужасный. Напуганный как зайчик. А он ведь пришёл разобраться,что да как. У меня есть оригинал диск и приставка. Я знаю о чем говорю. Если разраьы ещё могут исправит его лицо и выражение, то сделайте с этим что нибудь. Спасибо за внимание.
Release date???
finaly i feel so alive waited for this master piece
It’s backkk!!!
I mean, can we still get SH1 though?
I love music and the ambient of this game :'3 i'll buy it on day 1
Yes please, after this Silent hill 3 remake, i think this is going to be a massive cash boom for konami, they understand what fans want, and more that there is a lot of Silent Hill fans
Or start with 1.
PS4??????
Looks mediocre.
Guys, its was legendary😲
Guys, explain to me, how will someone cover the new parts of Silent Hill? I have never played it, but it would be very interesting to play. Thanks in advance for your reply
It would be so cool if they had Mads mikkelson play the main character
Why did they change James's face. And why does this FEEL like a Downpour copycat.
Other than James' face and voice acting it looks promising. Hopefully the music and themes remain present as well.
Wait why not Silent Hill 1? Was their already a remake or am I missing something? Still looking forward to this though.
Finally 😁😁😁😁
Silent hill 2 is one of my favorite silent hill games. These is gonna be awesome
it wound have been really cool if they added Silent Hill 2 piano theme song by the end of the trailer. But they did not....
The guy looks like (ಠ_ಠ)☞Marty McFly's dad from Back to the Future movie😅
Not even a minute in and I already hate it. Showing James coming into the bathroom breathing heavily and obviously shaken is a huge misstep that undercuts the games entire narrative structure.
By far my most anticipated game.
The voice acting is somehow worse than the original, this games gonna be 10/10 schlock.
Yeah can't wait for this 💞💞♥️
🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️♥️🙂💞💞
这是电影还是游戏？
Silent hill 2 and alan wake is the best
Should been Norman
One word "BEAUTIFUL" 🥺
Hey Konami release PT now 🔫
I actually just had a heart attack, I hope they give it the RE2 REmake treatment and keep mostly truthful to the original while getting rid of the things not necessary and adding things that improve it. If it goes well this could be better then any of the new Era Resident Evil games (RE7, RE2 REmake, RE3 Remake, RE8, etc.)
the new era of survival horror.
If this doesn’t get a PC port in the future this game will be the only reason to seek out one of the mythical 7 PS5s in existence.
anyway? what you mean anyway you don't seem very happy to see me.
oh Konami... i AM silent hill
going through a really bad breakup and I'm just glad my favorite games are being remade it gives me some kind of joy where there is almost none
I’m here for Table Daddy; Pyramid Head is old news frankly.
Ill watch the trailer once i play 1
The only things that are weirdly catching my eye are the main character looks like he was modeled to appear like a Japanese Crispin Glover. Also, why does Pyramid head look like he’s a strong 5’9? At least make that dude 6ft! Besides that, I’m buying day one 😅
♥️🙏🏻
That mirror scene looks like absolute dogshit compared to the original. Can't wait for another soulless "remaster" of a classic masterpiece...
It looks great i have a hope that Bloober Team will make a great remake. Trailer runs in 60FPS so maybe game will run in 60FPS too? Poland u can do this!
Enfim algo oficial. Mas poderiam começar pelo SH1.
Let's hope this guy finds his wife and they live happily ever after
The big surprise that no one expected ! This is really Incredible
So why is the original music not used here?
It's happened... ITS FINALLY HAPLENED
They should also remark silent hill which was Released ps1
U actually started crying seeing this series revived!
what's the name of the song at 2:30??
Quite frankly - I'm fed up with all these remakes of games I've already played, sure, I applaud the effort and it's always interesting to see your favourites with a new coat of paint, but... It's very easy to make mistakes and unnecessary changes when "reimagining" things that worked well.. and I'd much rather have a new game! A new Silent Hill! If you REALLY want to remake something, Silent Hill 1 would be a much better choice, Silent Hill 2&3 still looks surprisingly decent! Marketing reasons and recognition are to blame probably, SH2 is easily the most famous and beloved entry.
Finally .
02:29 Wow! This lyrical solo from Promise is great!
Imagine recreating the same game because you can't make anything better
Everything else is great apart from the main character. He looked a lot better in original version.
He looks like Edward Norton now
as much as i hate konami with a burning passion i gotta say im happy that sh 2 is getting a remake
I prefer silent hill 3
Thank you for trying
konamis actually making a new game??? well a remake but still!
What's wrong with Leon?
Can’t wait to hear that bell ringing when the monsters are too close, chilling !
Did I just see Pyramid Head? 😱

Whats wrong with face? Its not James...
I guess Konami finally stopped turning a profit on their Silent Hill Pochinko machines they made.  Also, why is the trailer not at all scary, why does this give off Alan Wake vibes?
the only game i will care to play in 2023
♥♥♥
Ahhh I cannot wait!
Chorei
Don’t get my hopes up again Konami
What about PS4?!
I dunno…🤦‍♂️ The character models are too much of a departure from the originals. As fans, we have so much invested in our experiences with this game and the characters over a period of 20+ years.  James looks like an older dude with a wig on his head and I couldn’t tell if that was Angela or Mary at the end, but either way, neither looks even remotely like the originals.  It’s just very jarring to see such a marked departure from how they looked to now and sorry, not sorry, I’m not impressed.😞
I hope they do Silent Hill 4 remake
Se ve muy cheap todo, ya veo que no va a estar bueno
Silent Hill the personal therapy town.
Ive never been more excited for any other game reveal! Never enough to make me shout and almost cry.  Thank you, Konami and everyone for pulling through! I just wanted this back for so long.. Welcome back, Silent Hill!!!
This is not a joke right??? I’m gonna have to buy a ps5 dude !!
É sério que o jogo não vai ter dublagem e nem legenda em português do Brasil , resident evil 4 vai ser dublado em português do Brasil , que decepção Konami , em pleno 2022 e não vão dublar e vender o jogo assim , nem legenda vergonha , português de Portugal é diferente de português do Brasil , não dão a mínima para o Brasil.
Finally my dream come true
Eu preciso jogar esse game
It's all cool but, why james look so old?

I’m ready to go back to silent hill. I felt all kinds of emotions stirring up inside me watching this and remembering younger me being scared shitless to go through the next door and now all these years later it is time for us to open that door again. It is time to revisit the beauty, the horror, the sadness and joy that was Silent Hill 2. It’s in our special place, waiting for us.
Eu não me canso de assistir isso.
What is Birkin doing!!!??
If it's ANOTHER reimagining I'm going to kill myself.
I'm definitely excited for this but it makes the sting of them cancelling Kojima's Silent Hills that much worse, especially with the way this trailer alludes to P.T.
Yaya awsome hype  woo !  oh wait i never played any of these haha  Pnlyaiistjaatjiion !!
Lloro 😭😭😭😭
My mother saw me play the original of this game and said: I now know why you play these games.
Efsane
I sincerely want the original music (not the score) of Mary Elizabeth McGlynn & Joe Romersa in this remake otherwise it's doomed to fail.
Oh, you can hear notes from Overdose Delusion at 1:43  and some of the Silent Hill Theme at 2:20. Glad to see they don't disavow the original game and its fans, unlike Capcom !
i could not believe it acctually happening
Now do MGS
I am fangirling so hard I feel like crying… I can’t wait for this!!
Man this one's gonna break the internet. 2 million plays in a day?! I did NOT see this coming. I'm so amped for this remake, and I KNOW other SH fans are.

I don't have high hopes on this since Bloober Team's Medium was so weak. Also the face expression is so artificial. But hey, who knows...
BRAVO PS5 🤝
Honestly, I’m not feeling the hype.
Silent Hill  PS2😍
This will make me buy a ps5 ❤
WE are ready too
The main character looks older and creepier than the original, I don't know what to think of it yet. Also it's another boring Playstation exclusivity, just let people play this game on their favourite console / PC...

Wait konami actually remembers silent hill?
Ok, but will the silent hill ranch sign be in comic sans???
Cant wait to play it
>No SH1 Fvck u Konami
Silent hill 2 remake?? I can't wait...
"Kept you waiting,huh?"
NO PC..
*ahmm* Konami. I thank you kindly for this - genuinely.   Not to sound greedy or anything but you’re clearly capable of stepping off on your own, sooooo  Metal Gear Solid when ? 😊  In the mean time! Thank you for giving us Silent Hill fans this beautiful looking title!
what, no Silent Hill 1 remake?
Pretty Perfect!!!
Thumbs down
well i never expect such paytowin company like konami remember their classics.. hope they dont make DLC on this game unless it was pay DLC.. this comment based by yugioh the game and the trading...
Wow
James does not look like James but apart from that everything looks promising tbh
VR please!
ps 1 silent hill was next level....i still remember that intro theme....just amazing.....
Wooot woooottt WOOOOOOTTTTTTT

Ignore the hate bloober team, this looks phenomenal & I know you'll do the game justice 😁🙌🏻
As long as Akira Yamaoka is making that soundtrack I'm in! Still wanna play the original though (it's just so dang expensive :P)
Leon is that you??? This is not you game 🤣

I want it painted black!!!!!!!!
I got a letter. The name on the envelope said Mary...
Looks amazing, I'm just still wondering how Kojima's Silent Hill remake could of went if it never gotten canceled.
Mary's 'in my restless dream' line is as eerie as it was in the original.
Personagem sem expressividade.
PS4?😔
This looks epic. One of my favourite games of all time ❤️
I just saw the minimun and recommended specs for this game and dayum, no way I'll be able to play it 🤣 To top it off it's PS5 only and not on PS4. Whyyyy?!?!!!
Resident Evil 4 + Silent Hill 2 = Brain BOOM!
Should have done 3. Would love to see Heather in HD.
Again 30 fps?
come silent hill 1. plz. pcccccccccc plz.
I really hope they don’t do a part 1 and part 2 to this game
Unbelievable
James looks nothing like the original.
Honestly cannot wait, I've watched this over and over wanting more.
Shattered memories is the best silent hill for me, if it was launched on todays days it would be so acclaimed, and don’t even need a remake cuz that game was ahead of his time, a true masterpiece
A true classic brought back to life in a new body 😮

Por favor quiten esa expresión de culpa en James 🤦🏼‍♀️ Él no siente culpa porque no es consciente de lo que hizo. De haber sido consciente en un principio, no existiría Pyramid head directamente. Están realizando una terrible incoherencia con el argumento.
耶，pyramid head

Today is one of my happiest days. Because I am going back to my depression (as if I came out of it) and back to where I belong 🖤

Wow
Oh yeah super cool… PlayStation
I don't know the Silent Hill lore, but if I were to pick a famous actor for the trailer character - which I assume is the main one - I'd call Ben McKenzie from the TV series Gotham and O.C.  The character in the game reminded me a lot of the actor.  If it wasn't a game, who knows, a feature film?
LET’S GOOO ! The hype is real !
Hope that we will get mgs remake next
Everytime I saw a man character with that hair, always remind me to Leon Kennedy
Stop console exclusivity.  Let EVERYONE enjoy games.  I have both systems and think it’s a step backwards to keep others from enjoying a game.  🛑

I bought a PS4 when I heard that a new silenthill game was being developed, but it never came out. I was able to play PT, but... Can I buy a PS5 this time? Can I believe it?, KONAMI
Se podrá jugar el PS4 ? 🥹
Don't add anything and don't remove anything from the original and you'll have one the best games ever made.I'm kinda worried Bloober will feel the need to put their own personal stamp on it and F it up.
Such a simple way to showcase that Silent Hill isn't just "horror", it's also "tragedy".
MY HAIR STOOD UP WHEN I SAW AKIRA YAMAOKA DOING THE MUSIC
This better be based on the directors cut version 🤨🤨😤
Thia game will hurt xbox, whaa whaa whaaa, hope the regulators stop this, whaaa whaaaaaa...
the game won't even be scary since it'll be third person.
Cant wait for this to come to PC.
I like how James looks a bit more f'd up, skinny and woeful... As it shows someone in depth of despair. Though, as development is still in it's infancy. I hope/think they need to add more 'wear and tear' to his features.
Its that leon kennedy !!?🙂😂
Vamos apreciar novamente
I'm here for you James. See, I'm real.

"It doesn't matter who I am, I'm here for you, James.  See, I'm real."   ..... ....im not crying...YOU'RE crying...
This is it Konami. This is your redemption shot. Make it count
at least now i can see the fears on his face
This looks really bad...
Shut up and take my money!
Idk dude should have been made more handsome 🫠
Akira Yamaoka I hope for you
Did they made James's fringes less shorter??
Corykenshin needs to play this
you people better read about this developer. they literally destroing this game now....
doggie secret ending pls
Nothing is scarier than Konami.    Will Silent Hill 2 survive just as Meta Gear Survive?
Silent Hill 2 is a masterpiece and I hope this remake gets the love it deserve so that a new generation can experiance it.
Now Konami needs to apologize to Kojima and remake the original metal gear game
Dog ending must be kept in the game.
Why James voice so angry???
Bro what are these graphics 😳 we are definitely living in a simulation
Just don’t PT us, ok?
Круто !!!!
Es solo para ps5 o también saldrá para ps4?
remakes again and again. I understand that the jump with 4k is a big leap for many console owners but come on...
James look 40's
Hair physics in gaming is still offputting but not as bad as in the past. Still I hope the game looks a bit better graphically, because this still has a kinda last gen PS4 feel. Its 2022, we are literally almost 4 years into this new gen. I hope the games EPIC! ^<^
I honestly hate that this remake exists.
Bloober Team is remaking this??? Hard pass... why can´t Japanese developers keep their titles Japanese, instead of tainting them with external garbage. Feels like a fake Silent Hill. I can´t wait for Slitherhead.
In my restless dreams,i see that town... -After all this time? Always.
PS4?
How will Konami squeeze micro transactions into this game?
not in ps4？？？？？😭😭😭😭
Finally 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
It's bread...
THE SIRENS ARE BACK.
Perfect 👍🙃🙃
The details of his ring removed from the finger in the mirror....
I’m usually excited for remakes but Silent Hill 2 is too perfect so I just can’t feel hyped for this.
Wow
I only played through this game once in my life and it was back then when i was a teenager. But I remember every single scene in this trailer. It was a super intense experience that was burned in my brain.
MC Leon sad boy??
Great display of keeping attention spans. Along with edge of the seat graphics and cut scenes. All to compliment the PS5® wow, just wow. 🫡🎮🎱
Can't wait this masterpiece!♥👍
I seriously might cry
250€ for a controller!!! What a shame!
Just need a PS5 now
Arg, no fanserviced Pyramid Head :(
Gänsehaut   könnt heulen
Ulo!!!!!
Amazing!
Ok Konami, now Metal Gear Solid 3.
I cant afford a ps5. I bought All the games and even an x box just to play silent hill as a kid/teen young adult
Very disappointing. Seems like everyone forgot that the reason we are hyped for Silent Hill is because KOJIMA WAS MAKING A HORROR GAME!? Not because all silent hill games are “10/10” and definitely not because “Konami is the best publisher”… WE DID NOT WANT 10 SILENT HILL INDIE GAMES, WE WANTED A HORROR GAME FROM KOJIMA! A new thinking game, horror like we never seen before.
This will be fun to watch YouTube's play
2023 will be the year for PS5.
Can they at least change the gameplay or whole style? I would have to pull some more hairs again if I gotta turn on the lights or electricity just so the character can "properly see" in the dark .... Damnit that was annoying on the PS2 version
выйдет а пк опять соня без экзов =)
Meh
WISE FWOM YO GWAVE!
Finally..
Ooh look, another remake 😆
Neeed itt 😩
The nightmare begins again
James looks like leon s kennedy but much older and daddy version..
Silent hill where i left my heart
END ALL REMAKES!
VR PLEASE!
Let's go!
People need to give a chance to this until we have some gameplay, we haven't see a Silent Hill game since Downpour and of course those dark times with Tomm Hulett are now over.   We have Ito and Yamaoka and maybe Bloober can make a decent job in graphics department. It's not the dream team that we were hoping for but maybe they can put at least something better than the lastest entries.
Pensei q nunca ia sair!
why not ps4 silent hill 2😡😤
please made it psvr 2 , too
Man...i love this series so much
Akira Yamaoka and Mary Elizabeth Mcglynn needs to work theyr magic one more time
Очень жду, хоть и не играл не в одну игру этой серии, только фильмы смотрел.
release when?
Looks great but why not a new game.
wow konami
Espero esté disponible para PS4
menit 2:30 = lagu terangkanlah, terangkanlah... jiwa yang berkabut...
They better keep the dog ending!!
+
Nice
You know what, even if the game somehow fails to deliver, we still get an official remake of the Soundtrack by Akira. That excites me the most :D
*NO MORE REMAKES!*
Silent Hill 2 is my childhood and will always be my favorite game of all time. I still can't believe it. It feels like a dream to see a new Silent Hill game after 10 years...
Pondran el final alternativo del perro????? Xd
FINALFUCKINGLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I always said that BlooberTeam should make a Silent Hill game. So glad they are!
What a great time to be alive.
PC, day 1. Censorship free.
i learned guitar just to play akiras songs from this game
Nah bro I don’t want to see the Fleshlips in 8k 😭
*Leon?*  I'm jk. Is Silent Hill F legit tho?
Hyped but not a fan of James new face, I can't recognize him. I don't know why remakes still make this kind of mistake when target audience obviously expect more faithfulness.
will lthis be a masterpiece remake or another trend following money milking low quality "remaster" by "KONAMI"
This game will be a must have when the lights are all out its night time and your playing the game in your room while everyone else is asleep
also where is guy cihi?
who here has heard of bloober team before? Strange choice tbh
Dont know if i can handle diamond head remastered
It has finally returned
Wait, this is real? Looks like trash
My favourite game, remade. We're living in the best timeline.
man the background score was soo amazing completely fitting the vibe
Bloober Team did a great job on Blair Witch and The Medium. This looks amazing!
i just wonder will Konami keep 2 soundtracks "Theme of Laura" and "Promise" of Akira Yamaoka? it like "Inception" or "Intertellar" without Hans Zimmer! No Soul anymore
2:30 name of the song? is new or...? i tried to found it through hearing the original ost of sh 2 but i didn't have luck getting it
In my restless dreams. I waited for this. Will it be a dream or a nightmare tho.
finally it come, I already waited for so long, in my restless dream
NEXT MINUTE KONAMI CANCELS OUT THE GAME.. JUST AS  AN EXTRA F Y
It’s slow and scary like old resident evil
They need to have pyramid head rio the clothes off a woman then tear her skin off and throw it at someone like the movie.
Its a pity we aren't getting Silent Hills with Norman Reedus but this does look very interesting
Where's Silent Hill PS1 remake?
Anjayy dibuat remake nya dong 😻😻
Was hoping James would look the same, but now he looks 20 years older and gaunt.
Why Ps5?  *Platform Ps4 Need*
Is this real happening?
Sad for Xbox and Pc players. 😅
The last message in the trailer @2:10 "I don't need you anymore, I am ready" is probably Konami saying this to Kojima 😆
why are you taking so long konami 😋😃
Lets goooo! Remake SH1 while yer at it!!!
UUUUUUUUUUFFFFFFFFFF los fanes de éste juegaso que lo jugaban en ps2. Estamos muy felices de ver esta remake, no tengo play station 5, pero seguro veré a algun youtuber jugarlo y lo voy a disfrutar mucho. Es un viaje a la infancia. ♥
Silent hill is back baby!!
I can't wait for Konami and Bloober team to deliver a wonderful disappointment.
how do to remake perfection
Character's face looks like  SH downpour
My life is complete. Thank you Konami.
ของดี
After 21 long years.....I'd think it's safe to take Mary up on that offer of meeting her at their "special place."
James looks even more sad now. Technology is incredible
It seems like they're really overdoing James's emotional expression. In the original team silent was really careful about things like that. Silent Hill wouldn't be Silent Hill if it missed things like attention to subtle details
Looks absolutely fantastic and exactly how I imagined a Silent Hill 2 Remake. Now please just make sure the actual game is great because those graphics and soundtrack are already amazing.
When will it be non exclusive?
1113
Si sacan dino crisis y parasite eve remake mi vida estara completa 😇
Why 2?
ART!
Please let there be a version for ps4 too please!🤞 😫🤞
meh
LEON!!!
Atmosphere.
Gonna skip this game on the PS5, can't wait to watch all the cutscenes on a pachinko mschine.
i need to see the end of the dog remastered😆
This is probably the biggest win for gaming since the PS2. Now if we got Silent Hills instead it’d probably end up being the greatest horror game of all time. Still decently satisfied with a remake tho they should’ve started from the OG.
Cool 😎 👍   Fatal Frame ?
I like everything about it except James's face, i mean who are you?
😍❤️
How does the Silent Hill series differ from Resident Evil?
Why i never seen Silent Hill 1 remake before?
lol, konami?? is your pachinko business no longer give you money?? after you butcher metal gear zombie, i wonder how will konami be butchering this game.
It's a pity that Guy Cihi doesn't return as James.
what a great time to be alive
Oye Illo juega esto porfavo
FINALLY
Konami still remember silent hill. So i hope they still remembering metal gear solid😆
That's no teaser trailer. It's a full video
Leon Kennedy ??? 😁
Just how many Silent Hills are they releasing at the same time? I just watched at least three different trailers for three new different Silent Hill games!
Dang, Team Silent is back!!!! Best game ever imo. Can’t wait 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hm..... It's Resident Evil, but cinematic is soo better, ya
But it's not p.t.
will it be a remake of Silent Hill 2? not from 1?
Why does he look like william birkin? Lol
I really need serious and knowledgeable opinions here. Will this ever be available for Xbox as a game disc? And if so how long until it would happen after release. Thank you.
Dejen la perra exclusividad permanente, que es eso de 12 meses   Xbox tiene sus propios exclusivos y nadie dice nada  Es tiempo que esta gran franquicia que empezó  en el azul se quede en el azul
We need a Metal Gear Solid remake!!!
They better include that ending with the dog
This is gonna be a masterpiece
why playstation dont make its own exclusive fps game as in past we tired of cheating call of duty
lets hope this doesent get canned before its released
🍑🔥🍑🔥🍑🚧
Looks doo doo.
The underratted masterpiece i waiting for by unexpectedly
Are you kidding me? I buy the HD collection just before the remake drops?!?!
Oh boy a sequel! My favorite! Love sequels! So awesome...nah.
I can't believe it, like a dream come true. James' reactions look so life-like. You can feel his pain
Na tym na bank zarobia😁😁  Sam też pewnie kupię 😎
Why no release date
Watching the trailer for the 10th time because I still can't believe it.
Release it in PS4!!!! We need this also do it Like resident evil 4 dit it.!! Come on!!!!!!!!!
ruined his face. looks like trash
Waited 22 years for this and I’m so happy …. I just know silent hill 3 is around the corner and that to me will forever be considered the scariest game ever made so far ……hate me for my opinion but it is what is …..sh3 is the scariest game ever …. Silent hill 2 is here though !!!!!!
Woah woah Konami are you sure this is right? I’m not seeing any pachinko machines or zombies what is this?
The heck Leon doing in silent hill
Gotta wait a year more for it to be on Steam. Like Final Fantasy VII Remake it will be worth the wait.
push these off me like huuuh
Perfect!
This looks amazing! SH is back!!
2:20 theme of laura muy bien Yamaoka
Me preocupa ilusionarme y que lo cancelen
Am i the only one who got a PT vibes into this
It needs the bad voice acting since that what they where going for back then to give it it edge
Game was TRASH 🗑 looked like mobile game and this will be too, graphics won’t help
Assistindo novamente
Konami, this is what i called Tawbatun Nasuha.
The remake we all wanted but wasn’t sure would be made. Go find her James…
Capcom, Konami, and Enix all making true remakes of their classic. Nintendo remake Ocarina or Majoras Mask already
please make a pc port im to poor for a ps5
They even got the late 1990s haircut on our guy
Felicidad en un solo video
Did konami finally had a proctologist come get their collective heads out of their rectums? I certainly hope so because this is sick.
What.....!
I hate that it’s coming out only for ps5
Lion in other univers hahaha
I like what I see already, just hope it turns out amazing.
"This is... Some kind of silent hill?" absolute chills 😩😔
Incrível 🙌🏻👏🏻
Please don't tell me this is a Playstation Exclusive
Not sure if it's intentional or not, but at 0.48 second it shows his ring finger but it looks like his right hand but shouldn't it be his left?
Nice
(working light fixtures and use of lighting) This is a HUGE negative for me, part of the psychological horror of SH is the lifeless feeling of a town, and the lack of electricity/lights.
a
He doesn't do the right movement with the hand :/
I'm not scared of horror games, nor creepy ambiences.  But I am absolutely terrified of cockroaches. Therefore, this trailer is terrifying for me.
Que hermoso! Espero un ramake de los titulos siguentes del team silent.  imaginate ver a heather y henry mason en alta resolución.
🤩🤩🤩🤩
Le falta más niebla 🤨
Bloober Team? Oh mother- This is like when James Cameron was hired to direct Aliens, except actually insulting.
what is this trend of this more more more poligons graphics, which looks like garbage, like fake manekens or whatever. I'll take older silent hill
Kojima and Del Toro had a better idea than this fools. f konami
I LOVE HOW THEY DIDN'T REVEAL THE CRAZY THINGS IN THIS TRAILER, it makes you curious of everything!
What if Dante and Vergil visits Silent Hill? You know, just for fun.
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES [999999999999999999 times more]
Even though it looks incredible I will not touch it with a 10 foot pole
❤️
Need a Metal Gear Solid Remake! Come on Konami
❤❤❤❤❤
Yesss....Silent Hill is back.❤️😍👋
Yamaoka Will be there?
Gotta look forward to that UFO ending.
If they dont keep the dog ending i'm blowing up konami's HQ
This game will come in PS4 ????
They really said "Silent Hill 1? Never heard of her"
Hopefully they don't do what Capcom did with RE3 remake and cut out half the game.
Why is James looking like Pole
Poor Xbox Fans🤓🤓🤭🤭🤪😂😂🤣🤣
this looks so terrible as a remake... the original voice actors can't be replaced. this definitely won't hit the same :X ESPECIALLY since Hideo Kojima isnt attached to this
I can't stop watching!!!
Chale los de ps4 como yo no podremos jugar esta jolla de juego
What the dog doing?
The constant sadness on James's face is shocking. this will be beautiful
I remember being 14 and only being able to play this  like 15 mins at a time. It was terrifying
ayo
Love it s2
Wait, did they remove all the corniness?
I could not finished because I was afraid. Let see now I am grow men
My overthinking brain: how is there running water there? Who’s paying for it? What company is it coming from?
bloober does not deserve silent hill 2 bru
oh my
Dont remake masterpieces. Remaster them. Games are art. Remake a failed game, not the successful ones. Chances are this will be average at best. Stop eating up the hype.
I hope it’s on ps4
Time to go to Heavens Night and enjoy the music in this remake.
NO Kojima NO buy
I really wish they can give players the option of NOT having that typical/repetitive over-the-shoulder camera and give us a 3rd POV like the original did. That is one of my biggest concerns for the Remake!
>World War 3  >Climate Collapse >Rising Fascism worldwide >New Silent Hill Content Not all is wrong in this world.
toi como loco chuchetumare
The only thing I'm not crazy about here is that James is only sad. James at the start of the original wasn't sad, but depressed, which is a very different thing. He looked cold and distant, and his voice was largely emotionless save for an anger and bitterness that he was barely holding back. There was even a bit of childishness here and there, as though James went through the game largely in a daze. The original performance was ridiculously nuanced and added a lot of impact to every word, and so far I'm not really hearing that latent anger or exhaustion here. Not much trauma in other words. That being said, this new peformance is still miles above Troy Baker's melodramatic take.
Is this sequel to Resident Evil 2?
Where is the gore?
Flashbang
Can't wait for this remake and RE 4 I hope they don't mess it up and keep the original element in both games
it has been so long since seeing Konami's logo in a trailer (in a real AAA game)
It was great up until the Konami logo
MAKE A NEW GAME NOT REMAKES
I WAS HERE
Oh this looks SO much better than the original! I got bored with the original so quickly due to the wonky gameplay and terrible graphics. This looks awesome, i cant wait!
WAT
As someone who's never played the games, I'm really looking forward to this.
Che ponganlo para PS4 no es justo esto
P.T., come back...
scary game btw cool
It’s a metaphor n shiet. He’s guilty over murdering his wife n suppressin it.
Hope they put it on Xbox or switch.
They changed the soundtrack?
love it me and my friend tomokinho and zumbicrelvis
i think its better than res evil 4 remake
por fin!!!!
Silent hill and re4 are back aw lawd
Hope this comes out on Xbox!
Will Sony censore it and does it line up with woke values?  If the answers are no and no then I'm interested
Silent Hill 2 really stuck with me basically my whole life. I’m so excited to play this remake. RE4 and this both getting modernized, I gotta be living in a dream or sum
them nurse zombies tho...
I feel so mixed. Can't wait to see gameplay
Where are the patches on james jacket?
Sony is like:  "Oh please don't make call of duty exclusive to xbox, this is monopoly. But let me take this game and make it exclusive to playstation"
Pachinkothropus has been destroyed.
Silent Hill is the name of Death Town..
I feel bad for Xbox users because this will be a PS5 exclusive release I think for at least a year 😂
Bring back UFO and Dog ending !!
AHHHHHHHHH🎉
Paaa una locuraaaa, mira como está esoooo
Konami please PLEASE make this everything I want it to be this is my favorite game of all time
too colorful imo.
🌫 I never expected this day to come. And one day... Silent Hill came back 🌫
es un juegazo.
Still not remake of MGS 1, 2 and 3 (F U Konami)
que lastima que no estará en Xbox 😔.
James looks like a hafu.
Now it's time for Konami to do justice with the Metal Gear Series.
the voices, they're sooo wrong!
I’m genuinely surprised at the amount of symbolism they kept from the original in this trailer. I hope we see it in the game too
🤸🏾‍♂️🤸🏾‍♂️🤸🏾‍♂️🤸🏾‍♂️🤸🏾‍♂️
So when does he turn into an Eikon?
The dog ending better be in there, Konami.
PS4 toooooo
James' movements seem exactly how I'd picture someone in his mindset and mood to stumble around
Glad a new generation will get the chance to play this the Og is a Outstanding Game I can’t wait for the remake
Oh hey look, yet another exclusive hogged by Sony. That's strange. Why are they complaining about the Activision blizzard deal again?
Que hace León en Silent Hill?
W h a t
Dont mess this one up
I hope they remix Angel’s Thanatos
Y ps4??
His hairline is too low, he got a three-head
Is this a zombie game?
WOAH
Guy Cihi voice DLC when?
Chile!!! I thought this was a troll video or a fan remake, can't believe my eyes someone pinch me
They realesed 3 silent hill game teaser this year
Ok... but is Hideo Kojima having a hand in this?
I don’t know
主人公の顔をおじさんではなく好青年にしてほしい。
Хрена се! Придётся плейстейшн брать, чтобы одну игру пройти :)
Amazed by the atmosphere
I'm waiting for the best Silent Hill to be remastered: Silent Hill 3
If Kojima would show his own game at his press conference, then they would be surprised to see his game becoming a legend of the true Silent Hill series.
This is one game I’m definitely pre ordering at game stop
James resembles Leon S. Kennedy
I love how the fog looks identical to the original, they could've added more render distance but I think keeping it tight is a great way to maintain that anxiety as we roll into over the shoulder play style.
It looks very movie, it might be hard to make it as scary as the original
The roach in the begining im calling him Dave
The original version of Silent Hill 2 was really interesting. Now that most of the nostalgia games are being remake Sometimes they lose that former pleasure. I hope this remake will be successful.
This face…
pyramid head!!
I’m so excited to play this
No ps4? F***
I want to be excited for this game, but it's being made (or at least published) by Konami
Resident evil 4 remake and Silent hill 2
I need this ASAP!!!!!
The Best Game never
Dog Ending is canon
Man I am so excited . And really I don't care what James look's like as long as they captured the originals feel !
Where is norman reedus:(
This must be heaven
I had just watched Whang's video on the circumcision theory and now I find out they are remaking Silent Hill 2
Silent hill, silent hill!
Yes
I'm looking forward to it but this trailer isn't very impressive.
DEMI APA DEMI APA ADA YG KEDUA NYA? ARRGGHHHH MANTAPPP
FINALLY
Finally 🤩🤩🤩
Why start with 2? Why not remake 1????????????????????
Leon Kennedy's looking pretty rough
so is the original ost going to be in the game or are they doing a whole new soundtrack
GAME PASS
All time favourite horror game. Groundbreaking at the time
Daddy Konami returned back with the silent milk
Nope
Character models look like they are straight out of a PS3 game... 😅 After Scorn on Series X my standards are way too high. 🙄
So a Silent Hill 2 remake ok then that’s great, I can’t wait. 👀 … ok I’m sorry I have to ask, they’re not skipping Silent Hill 1 remake are they? I mean I love 2, 2 is great but 2 does kinda come after 1 so that’s still a possibility right? they won’t forget about the SH1 fans right?  SH1 remake is joining PTs Silent Hills into the pipe dream realm of “Not Happening” isn’t it? 😔
They twinkified my boy (Pyramid Head)
Just imagine a world where Konami starts to remake all their iconic games
I'm not inherently against a remake of Silent Hill 2 but I don't really know how well it would work the original benefitted from the uncanny character models and bizzare voice acting and while that may not have been the intention of Team Silent it is one of the reasons the original game holds up so well all these years later in terms of its atmosphere.
This is the best news I’ve heard in a long time. It’s about time we got a modern silent hill game.
When I was a kid, I got scared shitless playing this game on the ps2. Never managed to finish the original game. Now that I'm an adult I can revisit the game again and get scared shitless again but this time in 4k lol
Had hoped for a remaster of the trillogy but im glad for the remake
I'm honestly surprised it wasn't a pachinko machine announcement for the west.
Silent Hill 3 scared me more tho
It's cool to see the guys that make pachinko machines branching out
If it only releases on PS5 it better be when people can actually get one for the original price.
I love Silent Hill! I LOVE music composed by Akira Yamaoka. I NEED IT IN MY LIFE! 🖤
To think that this wouldn't exist if Japan didn't crack down on gambling.
Konami? Never hated it.
This look so incredibly bad. Animation and visual fidelity looks extremely dated. So sad that one of the scariest games I have played, will not be met with respect.
James really does look a bit older in this redesign, a little bit more world weary but isn't looking too bad! although I will miss his handsome young looking face 😂
Perfeição
James sunderland 👌
As 3rd person, it’s not as scary.
The BEST silent Hill of all! 😎
I can't even count how many times I've watched this over the past 24 hours
the only thing i'm waiting to experience is the original soundtracks again
Welcome back 🎮❤️🇧🇷
If they remake the trilogy and bring back PT Konami will be in the top with Capcom again. PLEASEEEE finally they listening the fans
Ps4 version please.
the best horror game of all time, let's see how this remake will make it justice
It feels so weird knowing two of my favorite games, Resident Evil 4 and Silent Hill 2, are getting a remake.
Silent hill 2 was the best in the series imo. Thankfully can’t remember too much of the game. Except the hotel closet scene which appears to be teased in the trailer 😮
I am beyond excited for this! Such a wonderful horror game. Remade in the 2020's would be amazing.
“Mary…?”
Is Real??
Hope they keep that dog ending.
In my restless dreams, I see people complaining about how they don't have new Silent Hill games, and then the same people complaining about how they have new Silent Hill games.
Where is the game music?
Silent Hill P.T!
There was a hole here, but it's gone now.
Why bother? It'll never live up to Silent Hill Downpour
O jogo parece animaaal
If future me sees this after playing the game, remember this as the day I had to take a 2 mile sprint in heavy boots because I couldn’t contain the energy of my excitement. I haven’t been THIS excited for anything since I was like maybe 5.   Just relishing this moment right now.
New personality just dropped 🔥🔥🔥
If they can make a game why not a movie?
Konami doing something right. This is a very unique event after years of nothing.
PS exclusive?
Was the cockroach on the on the concrete floor a PT reference? I kinda think so but I also know that Konami wants to pretend that PT never existed so.
no more ideas so they keep remaking ancient games.
TEBRAA KOLKO DOBRO!!!
Damas y caballeros LES PRESENTO EL MEJOR JUEGO DE TERROR
no nuclear strike alarm in this trailer? 0/20
Okay, we need to know who's behind it
I hope it's just a visual remake
i have been waiting for this for years
One of the things (for me) that made silent hill 2 so scary, were the graphics, those old and low resolution textures, with the poligons and the poor light effects made it's atmosphere really frigtening
So it won’t be on Xbox
Resident evil remake vibes
0:24 You can see that his hand actually has flesh.
Magdalene from sh2 ost playing in the background...
sempre quis conhecer silent hill, descobri muito tarde e como jogador de pc 99% das opções são velhas/em emulador, finalmente tão aderindo na seita de remake da tia capcom gloria a deus
I have a feeling that pyramid head will be kinda like the nemesis mechanic in resident evil remakes
This looks amazing and another reason for me to get a Playstation 5. Nice one Konami!
Me vry Happy
This is for real!!!!!!!!!!!
hey capcom, looks like Leon Kennedy decided to switch Survival-horror games
Can't wait , don't let us down
I used to play Silent Hill in PS1 when I was kid ❤,I guess this game is scariest game ever 😅
WOW 🤩
WOW THEY MADE A SEQUEL TO PT?!
I cant believe I'm getting emotional over a game that gave me literal nightmares.
E infelizmente nada do P.T. Silent Hills. Esse jogo precisa ser lançado um dia, seria um divisor de águas. O projeto tem que ser tirado da gaveta
New faces is bad...
🔥
Al final del video,como cruza la puerta el paio ese con el pedazo de casco sin chocar contra el marco?? 2:43
Looks stunning.  Silent Hill 2 is one of the greatest games of all time, definitely worthy of a remake.
В Россию дойдет???
RIP for ever  Silent PT 😢
After this I expect a Metal gear 1 remake.
Remember the hole in the wall 🧱
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
Gess Konami will f*** it up....
Estou no hype!!!
James looks and feels totally different. Original James was more confused and i like his voice more. This James feels more like a whiny teenager.
This is the best day of my life
trash
Ok but when is the pachinko machine version coming out? That's usually how I get my lore for Konami games.
Where's his Sheffield accent gone?
excited, i hope it can do the original justice even w/out the original voice actors. james character model is weird to me a little, he be looking like he is 60 lol
Even though I'm for this It's peculiar to hear the remakers happening for part 2 instead of a part one
Konami but without the F-word I pull out the F-word. Now, let the game as we expected 🥺
reminds more of downpour lol
Polzga pszejmóje ten wilm
There was a hole here.  It’s gone now.
I wonder if theyll show what he sees outside the closet like they did in og
Please Konami metal gear 1 remake 🙏
What kind of song sounds on the excerpt from 2:29 to 2:37?
Eita Geová do Espaço. Quero!!! Me lembrou da Gforce 2 genérica que rodou esse jogo na força do ódio.
Hasta la polla estoy ya de los remake.
Our prayers have finally been answered!
Thank you
Cannot wait to see how they will add micro-transactions to this one .
thats not P.T. right?
Not Leon Kennedy
LISTEN…. KONAMI IS ABOUT TO EAT!!!!
Me gusta Silent Hill, pero tengo mis dudas sobre esto.
Meh
We waiting 😮
Wow about time! Definitely getting the collectors edition!
Thought this was part 2 of Kendrick and Kodaks song for a sec lol
The bear/chub community is gna break when we see Eddie
Cautious optimism, people. Cautious. Optimism.
Is that gonna be on steam ?
What a waste of time.
Silent hill remake, and its not on an arcade machine? Has Konomi finally come to their senses?
Take my money now! 💰 🤑 💸
So beautiful!!!
WE still prefer P.T.
GIVE ME METAL GEAR!
So stoked
Amazing 😍
can't wait for the secret UFO ending
It gives me the vibes they wanted to use Leon S. Kenedy's face as a reference, but then make it a little bit uglier. My boy James was not this ugly lol The eyes are a complete miss and I do not recall him having a pointy nose like that.
Is that a normal human sized Pyramid Head??
Not sure but the imagery on the promo image seems to mock death stranding...
just hoping this is not another P.T letdown, i was looking foward for P.T so much then they announced the game got cancelled and it break my heart.
Jeryl players?
The music in this game was amazing. Promise and the reprise are haunting. Loved the game, can't wait for this to eventually come to PC. (I don't have a PS5 but fortunately Sony seems a bit better about letting games eventually release on PC.)
Cool 😎
Third person?
i just hope they keep the pauses and the emptiness in the way the characters talk and move. i know that this was a fail in the game, something wrong cause the lack of technology but it was something that made silent hill what it is.
so hyped <3
Ito on creature design just take my money ,finally justice for Ito possibly one of the best graphic designers in the world
Real system seller
Weak exclusive technique.
Whoa, i remember those days.. when we were too afraid to play this game.
Let’s face it, we’re only excited about seeing the one who actually runs silent hill again ( if you know, you know)
es exclusivo??? definitavemente gsno PS esta vez
I want to play this video game. I am screaming. (Because I am happy with this).
So THIS is what they've been working on while re-releasing all those old game collections!!!
My favorite game ever. I'm so excited.
konami must not of been making money on the pachinko machine's
I have been manifesting a remaster of Silent Hill 1 and 2 for so long and to see this trailer is so overwhelming. I hope they also remaster Silent Hill 1 because these games are the pinnacle of survival horror
My joy.
Is it unreal engine 5 :o ?
yes pc
Already missing james original voice 😔
Algo que no es un pachinko, que milagro.
AWESOME 😍😍😍
W
I didn't think I'd live to see this...
Konami finally remaking/remastering Silent Hills after seeing years upon years of Capcoms success with RE remakes/remasters. C’mon now Nintendo, give us an Eternal Darkness remaster!!!
do I sleep?
Yes please
Es una locura. Totalmente parece un juego nuevo
Куплю ps5 ради этой игры 😁
The music is incredible!!!
Welcome back
The tiny water puddles are mirrors, and they don't interact.
Problem is I've played silent Hill 2 so many times I know the game backwards but we will see of any changes apart from the graphics
Welcome back  Old friend🥲🥲🥲
Why can't they make new things... SH2is a masterpiece, it won't translate well to modern gaming
It's already perfect.
This must surely be “Abandoned”..😏
My most favorite game!!! I can't wait to hear the new Pyramid Head theme
Do as We say, not as we do.  The hypocrisy is thick in here.
Where's James?????
👀👀👀
I will never forgive Konami for killing the project involving Reedus, Del Toro and Kojima....never...
Would be perfect if a remixed theme of laura played at the end of the trailer.
I want a silent hill 4 : the room remake
The only complaint I have is that Mary McGlynn didn't voice Mary/Maria like she did in the HD remake for PS3. If they had kept the new voices with these graphics I would've eaten this up. I just did not like Mary Shepherd-Sunderland's original voice, it grated my ears hearing it.
Some of the best parts of this game came because of the limitations of its time. I hope modern technology and pursuit of realism doesn't change it too much.
It's all ogre now.
You better don't f*** this up KONAMI!!!
Was excited until i saw the Bloober team logo
This looks promising to me, I appreciate a new perception of this classic horror masterpiece.
Фууу
looks ok, but i really dont have any expectations because of konami
Why does he look just like Leon from RE?
В одну реку не войти дважды. Пора придумывать новую историю. У меня она есть ;)
Boo instead of Akira yamaoka we got b rate rolling stones 😡💢
у плойкаёбов ВРЕМЯННЫЙ эксклюзив!
They need to make it darker, and they need to make the textures grainier like in the original. The lighting looks like ambient light sources, not otherworldly. James has to be stuck in his own personal SH. Just his torch to help him in between the respite.  It looks promising. But SH2 is one of the greatest games ever made. The bar is high. Very high.
i could cry...wait, i do.
Man, so far they have nailed this as a remake, it looks phenomenal! I can't wait to see some gameplay, hopefully at the game awards!
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
No esta para ps4?🤬🤬😡🤬😡🤬😡🤬
Who is this fake man and what has he done with James Sunderland?
I was hoping for part 1 but this will do
Thanks, Sony, for support this project. I hope, in future we'll see new Silent Hill project, developed by Sony Worldwide Studios
É isso que a gente precisava!!! Alguém br? 🇧🇷
I often watch the speed run to this game because I don’t care about buying a ps whatever to play it. Now I will have too….
I wonder will it be released on ps4  too or only on ps5 ?!?!
I will Reserve my Judgement until I get my PlayStation 5& I get my hands on there Silent Hill Games they Deserve a Fair Shot. 😇
I wonder if they keep the UFO Ending. I loved SH1 and SH3 more than SH2, so if we might not get Remakes for those two after this comes out, I hope that at least I'll/we'll be able to see a "HD" (or should I say "2K"?) Harry Mason!
wow
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Freue mich so rießig, am besten noch ein Remake von Teil 1 und 4. Das wäre einfach so mega.
The dynamic fog is killing me I hope it is look like the smoke effect in batman Arkham Knight.
Konami remembered Silent Hill😱😱
Где купить?
please, i need shattered memories remaster
Рада что музыка будет от акиры.я. , без него даже не посмотрела бы в сторону этой игры ) или что ремейк, переосмысление.
Can't believe this is true.
My favorite part of Silent Hill gets a remake, what a day!
hype is REAL
PlayStation exclusive, means that it is On PS5 only and 1 year later on pc, or day one pc as well and 12 months later on xbox nitendo as well?
Господи как  же долго я этого ждал
Honestly, like how the town looks way better than in pt. Here the color pallet is so mute and dull and the fog in pt was kinda pathetic
This gave me demon souls remake vibes really excited for the sh2 remake
Finally my chance to catch up with this franchise. Hopefully this will be amazing.
um where is s hill 1?
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU
i heard that this game is only for one month to buy, is that true?
I hope they are gonna bring back "Laura's theme song" really love this.
Will this be on ps5 only? If so I need to get my bf one asap!!
So...NOT anything Pachinko-related...
I'm happy...but....can we get a new one....just please...please I need it
From what I’ve heard about Bloober, I’m not a fan, but I’m so glad Silent Hill is getting the recognition it deserves from waiting 10 years for a new game to come out.
I swear on a sink fetus, If this gets canceled, we storm Konami!
I'm so happy!
It looks just as crappy as those "concept trailers"  on unreal engine 5. Even worse. Gloss, gloss and more gloss. Nothing "dream-like" about the image here. All gloss and fancy destylized graphics.
Almost 2 million views in less than 24 hours 🌼 I am definitely day dreaming these days
Может быть. Когда-нибудь.
In the original one the mirror scene was completely black and you had to turn up the light of the screen revealing that the character is looking at you. One missing detail that makes me doubt a lot about this product.
It's back.
Gráficamente es malo.
Por favor,que salga para psvr2
Oh my, LORD!!!! ITS BACK!!!! MA I NEED THE MONEY!!!!!
One of the most iconic horror games of all time and now I get to play a remake?! Do it justice Bloober or nobody will look to your studio for another game ever again. Atmosphere and music have to be spot on for this.
I had chills, Absolute goosebumps hearing about this. WOW.
This has gotta be fake... No way Is this real. Konami doesn't care how bad we want this series to make a come back. Or do they?!?!
What I wanna know is if they are going to cut content out from the original game like how falcon did with the resident evil remakes
The best game play ❤
Time for me to go "Mary?" every 5 seconds
This is a weird looking pachinko machine
His face look weird
Проснись, Леон, ты не в той игре
PT silent hills is what everyone wants.
These games are terrifying. I can imagine what it would be like on PS5 😮
My uncle is black.
Just for this video I would like to buy a PS5, Silent Hill is still alive!
Ok now release Silent Hills
not impressed, just a remake. won't buy it. still boycotting them ever since the cancellation
Hope Akira makes some great songs again
You know what this means right? That's right boys...Solid is coming MGS Remake will be next!!!  SNAAAAAAAKEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!
Thank you
Hope they don't dissapoint with this one
Can't wait to see Maria again
No way this is real
That fog performance it's just crappy,the animation it's very, very  bad to the point were ruins the rest of the picture!I really hope the final games has the fog performing correctly!
They can when they want to
eyaculacion exitosa
CARALHOOOO ANDAR NA CIDADE COM ESSA NEBLINA NESSES GRÁFICOS VAI SER SURREAL AINDA MAIS A NOITE JA QUE NO SILENT HILL 2 DE PS2 TAMBÉM SE PASSA A NOITE 👏👏👏
Ésto es increíble, si no sale como mejor juego del año, pega en el palo.
You got my attention Konami.
I can't bear it. I wish they'd just left SH2 alone. :(
Playstation.... legend of Dragoon make it so.
Wow it seriously lost the vibe of the original. Shame because I know all of us wanted to experience more silent hill after all these years. Silent hill has been a core part of my childhood and to see James turn into  RE2 remake Leon is kind of a let down. I don't have high hopes for this but I also wouldn't mind being pleasantly surprised.
games have changed a lot  now rhe character has face expressions liked it
O trailer do ps2 tava melhor Kkkkkkk
Garbage and not needed. Exactly like RE4.   But gamers are the ultimate consoomers and will eat anything up.
Is “wishlist now” a thing now?
Fans are screwed
In my restless dreams, I see that town. SILENT HILL.
When you know what the game is gonna be just from the wall tiles in the toilet
Oh sweet PyramidHead!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍
The only reason why I need a PS5 Now
literally just yesterday i complete sh3 bruh
Its a little thing but I think James looks too much like RE leon
Looks amazing! Can't believe we are getting a remake of one of the best Psychological Horror games ever made, Silent Hill 2! Bring it on.
😮😮😮ej tu dirst..labs!!!
Thank you I’m crying and shaking
no team silent...no silent hill.
Ready for this trailer to be replayed by Konami for 5 years before abruptly canceling the project.
thats not.... where.... the door.........
Aaaaaa
I’m hoping James still put’s he’s hand down the toilet now in HD lol
Народ!!! Ждем всю квадралогию шедевров
Well, we got something at least. It looks great for now but I'm not too into his face haha. It's not bad but maybe it doesn't really capture Jame's real cadence.
James character design looks meh. And visuals look very unrealish. can't hear any iconic Yamaoka riffs either. not impressed, overall.
Un gigante ha vuelto!!!
"Juegazo", Y otro refritazo para Ps5 por que ya no les quedan ideas para hacer franquicias nuevas. Entre películas, juegos y más, no veas que época de refritazos se están marcando.
Dang it, I was hoping to see Norman Reedus 😂
Why silent hill 2?, we need SILENT HILL 1, after that, silent hill 2, 3, and finish
silencio gil
My radio begin to make wierd noises, again finally
♥.♥
Seeing Akira's name made me cry. I can't wait to hear Heaven's Night and Prisonic Fairytale in this remake. Especially Maria and the Labyrinth
They make a remake for sh2 not sh1 cuz it's the most popular silent hill game in the series
ALILUYA!
Wow, Leon can't catch a break! Jokes aside, this looks fantastic!
Never in my life i've felt this happy for a game announcement. I'm gonna cry.
Now put Norman Reedus in it
Looks like we in fact did get resident evil 7 3rd person mode
Not sure how I feel about overly dramatic voice acting and James' puppy dog eyes.
James honey? (epic guitar melody starts)
Absolutely one of the most chilling and emotionally charged survivor horror games I ever played. I'm so happy to see a revamped version. The news released at such perfect timing in my life!
If this works, we might see a remake of 1, 3 and 4 too, so I’m hoping this works out and that we get a great remake
Broooooo!!!!
It's happening
Silent Hill best components were the music, atmosphere and how the horror actually meant something meaningful and personal. Hopefully they can capture that.
was happy until i saw its a play station 5 exclusive
They mentioned how hundreds of teams get in contact with them every year to work on Silent Hill and they chose Bloober out of all of them?
WOOOW. Cool!
Thank you konami 🤗❤️
I'm going to buy a Ps5 for this...
As a huge silent hill fan, all the upcoming projects are welcomed, finally one of the best horror series of games is getting the love and attention it deserves, but I wonder is there hope for Castlevania?
IM LITERALLY SCREAMING
What a great day to be a PS5 Owner!
Ну тут даже я прихуел
Why they make James a cry baby seems he's about to cry the whole time
HOLY F*^&*()( ()*&&*(^@_ &^))(&^&)!!!!! Its literally a dream ive been having for years and years.
❤❤❤KONAMI♥️♥️♥️
Is this really Silent Hill? Looks more like Loud Hill to me!
One of the best games of all time. Silent hill 2 is a masterpiece. Deserves a remake.
The best horror game ever made...is reborn again
Where Epic "Theme of Laura"? !!!
Ничего не понятно, но очень интересно!
Why silent hill 2? Why not silent hill1 its the best one of them.
Can’t wait to get in water again! 🎉
The old one was better….
I wished there was a complete new silent hill game.
FINALLY
Konami is gonna bring back MGS! i have hope
They better add the dog ending.
My only complaint is that James sounds too tough. Lol. He needs to sound more wimpy.
It looks more like Alan Wake than Silent Hill 2. I hope they get the 'art' right. It seems a bit too clean to me.
what about PC release??
Hoping we can play on ps4 ;-;
KINO IS BACK
And Silent Hill 1 what >:C?
Leon
is this somewhat related to P.T.?
This is a cruel april fools joke, and it isn't even april
Beautiful. Looking forward to this.
3min = teaser ok (?
IT'S HERE WOOOOOO
Another old game for $75? Duck yeah count me in!
nothing can kill the original but a big "THANK YOU" this game got some attention again after so many years
I hope they remake all 4 Original Silent Hill quadrilogy!
They better remake the all 4 Original Silent Hill quadrilogy!
Cma não reclama desse jogo ser exclusivo por 1 ano no play e atrasar para os jogadores de Xbox, defende o consumidor assim? Sony hipócrita
I’m waiting for the eventual tagline, “also being developed for PS4, Xbox one, and Switch 😂
My childhood is going hd 4k and I'm ready for it.
metal gear solid
At least it can't be worse than Book of Memories.
Silent Hill 2 remake coming out in 2023 same as Resident Evil 4 remake. Is it a coincidence that the protagonist here has the same hairstyle and basic look design with Leon Scott Kennedy? Konami ripping off  Capcom's biggest star... Silent Hill is strong enough to stand on its own without needing to resort to this ripping-off tactic.
por fin
*****Standing Ovation*****
I hope this comes to PC also
Finalmente 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Where is Silent Hill 1 remake?
Where is traditional soundtrack ???????
It looks absolutely awful.
Why does the Bloober logo look just like the "boy lover" symbol the FBI documented that major p3d0s use? They should probably get that changed
why it took a trillion years to make number 2 🤦‍♂️
SILENT HILLLLL LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
Looks great!
Some yes, mostly, no. Another Konami L based on this trailer
PS5 console exclusive means no one will get to play it.
NOW DROP PT!
For real?
I Will remember this day for the rest of my life. thank you so much.
Yess Finnaly
Great to see Akira back. Always loved his music.
Solo ps5 :'(?
Does ps5 have a selling point yet that isnt a remake/sequel?
Welcome back to silent hill....enjoy your stay......
PT наконец то выходит?
STOP with the remakes already! You are becoming boring!! Hit us up with something new!!! 👎🏻
ps4
Will this only be on ps5?
Let’s just take a minute to thank our game creating overlords for this masterpiece.
Is that Ben Afleck's voice on James?
Лял ля я везу с собой кота
Мои аплодисменты ! восхищаюсь вами !
PYRAMID HEAD IN HD OHMIGOSH
chills, spine tingling chills~
And there are still fools out there that claim video games are not art.
Why not make a new game instead? Age of remakes.
silent hill 3 next please
Finally, a reason to buy the PS5, in 5 years, when it's finally available, for a normal price.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Leon S. Kennedy is in the House😂
From Daryl Dixon to Leon S Kennedy
oh yes! I need this so bad!
I never let go of you SH2.  I never gave up hope.   Don't let me down Konami
YES!!!
finally !!!
the characters look too smooth. I hope they improve on the body animations. needs that grainy filter like the original.
Sony como pode eu comprei o ps5 ta com um mês e ja deu problema no dualsense
Never played silent hill, but thats how you do a remake. Looks amazing
con el debido respeto que se merece resident evil 2, este juego es sin duda una obra maestra y ocupa el trono del survival horror , que gusto saber que volvera... una historia como pocas han sido contadas
ليه مافيه بلاستيشن 4 💔💔💔💔
I can't wait to play this game in my Xbox with game pass and Nintendo switch.
FINALMENTE! Só pra nova geração? 🙄😒
Let's be real here everyone the game looks beautiful but the combat is gonna be as cringe as ever hahaha I'm excited regardless
James? What happened to your face, James?
This game will be very insane!
Less goooo
Whoow🥇
I want this please dont make it ps5 exclusive
Me dio mucho hype, espero jugarlo pronto!!
Những ca sĩ khác cho mình cảm giác thư giãn khi nghe! Còn ĐP luôn cho mình bị cuốn theo tinh thần bài hát.
Wow. I would play this a million times over. ❤
I can't wait to play it on PC and we all know it will come on PC we all know it
ele parece um irmão mais velho do leon
You know, I should be excited but then again....this is Konami. Remember Silent Hill Hd collection? Remember MG Survive? So until I see more and actual reviews of it, not jumping the train, sorry.....
YESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! In my restless dreams i couldn't believe in something such beautiful!
Day 1 absolutely 🎉
Insane
This was one of the most weird and memorable games ever made, and this remake is looking amazing!
I’m just crying…
Where's the texture? Everything looks so mat. Silent Hill is supposed to be a hellscape, where nothing is clean, everything is supposed to be dripping with blood and sinew. Looks half-arsed, and these FMVs are supposed to entice me to buy it? I'd rather play the original, at least the grainy graphics give it the rough look.
Leon verse
Наконец-то!Но вот плойки 5 нету((((
I wonder if this will be resident evil like
you're as beautiful as the day I lost you
Finally,thanks
Time to get a ps5
BRB GOTTA GO HAVE A QUICK CRY BECAUSE MY DREAM HAS COME TRUE
now we wait
Xbox players are seething right now 😂
Another flop
aHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
PS Plus should add Silent Hill 1-4!
Old character designs look better
Honestly stop with the remake and make a true next gen game.
I shall not believe until it is released
YES YESTES SYETSUEYSIVSISJSHSJSOUSHSYWJAFYAJAAUAIWUAJAQKCSIA  ON SCCKSIXHWYPW  IF EIE OH HAPAH WHWIFWUSN FUDKS
It doesn't look bad but somehow the Silent Hill atmosphere is missing. Too much light, too little fog, too many warm colors and everything looks a bit too clean and rigid.
Konami não lembrou não provável que está sem dinheiro ok
Glad to see that James finally learned how to park
Never played this game but heard how scary it was. Can’t wait to WATCH the gameplay lol
I want to be excited but i can’t trust konami as far as i can throw a pachinko machine
Cant wait to play this on PC on Day 1!!
YES YES YESS
Love the music
Direkt Latte bekommen
Beautifull. Nareszcie.
Caballeros, revivio la industria.
That was that scene were pyramid head was getting it on with the things 🤣
While this is intersting to see, I'm a bit on the hesitant side with it because the original Silent Hill 2 was a true classic of art. The atmosphere, the music, and yes even the "weird" voice acting was what made the game so amazing an experience and while I hope that this remake retains all those core values, a small part of me feels like it's gonna get too wrapped up in the theatrics and making it more "cinema" like than a straight up unsettling fever dream. But eh, I guess we'll just have to wait and see how it goes. Here's to hoping.
Its been too long I hope they dont mess this up
STOP HURTING JAMES, make a sequel FGS!
While on the one hand, everything seems to be well made and respectful to the original, from the way the characters are animated to the use of music from the original game... on the other hand I think it just looks way too clean. The original game is grimy, muddy, dark, foggy, unclear, ominous. This just looks too high fidelity and bright. In this game you can see individual water drops, while in the original you could almost smell the rust and mold.  They should, at the very least, dirty up the image a little bit.
Nice way to tease us by releasing the trailer close to Halloween so we'd think it's releasing soon for Halloween.  Also I'd rather they remade Silent Hill 1.  Aside from my complaining this is still a day one purchase for me.
gonna get that ramake dog ending
Step in the right direction Konami! Also I'm glad to see that it will come to multiple platforms, eventually.
I’M SO HAPPY
como la grafica no me convence y tiene mucho que mejorar en los aspectos de los personajes. hay que ver la jugabilidad que tal se veo, pero hasta ahora pinta un juego regular en comparacion del anterior.
Lourd......!!!!!!!
Lourd......!!!!!!!
I couldn't believe it. I had to like triple check if I was really on the PlayStation channel.
Wah anjiirrr keren
1,4 mio views in 17 hours … i think many oeoples waiting for new silent hill games :D
Так,заткнитесь - и просто возьмите мои деньги!
We are at the BEST TIME EVER... Silent Hill 2 Remake. GT VI Resident 4 Remake. Spiderman 2 Wolverine.  🤩🤩🤩🤩
best teaser trailer ever seen
can anyone explain me what is silent hill about?
The tradegy of being a 24 yr old man with the realization of finally understanding what is right and what is wrong, remade for us to experience once again
xbox😑😑
0:36 That mirror shot remembered me cyberpunk !
Shouldn’t this game be called “I Am The Cheese…Pure Cheese 🧀” did a high school kid write and direct this or something? Bet he thinks it’s amazing. I mean the character got on his knees and screamed!!! HE ACTUALLY SCREAMED!! 🤤
How I waited to see the pyramid guy
Ah bloober team, so frame rate issues and bugs ahoy! Great...
Yo, this mf kinda looks like Leon
Uau,konami criou vergonha na cara e deixou de fazer só pachinco,meu deus do céu,eu não posso acreditar,só espero que não venda os sustos separado como DLC,algo absurdo?talvez,mas desde que foram capazes de cobrar por saves....,bom mas esse é um momento feliz,não quero parecer chato,teremos fé
Bit worrying none of the SH2 soundtrack is featured....
I really hate exclusives. Guess I’ll just have to watch someone else play this 😔
Hahaha  "Makes cod exclusive to Xbox"
Leon S Kennedy in Silent Hill?
This is exactly this kind of thing I expected from an SH2 remake. ...and I don't think I like it. ...or hate it. But it definitely looks scrubbed of any off-kilter, uncanny elements or subtlety.
It would be funny as a joke/ Easter egg insult. That at some point in the game Maria hands James on of those joke teeth and says. “ I had this for some reason.” 😜😜😜😜😜 as a punch to the gut of the gf remake.
no me lo puedo creer.
I hope they add the dog ending
this James doesnt feel like he is about to go for the in water ending.
По делом тебе...ты сам убил ее
Wow... This game is gonna make me cry all over again..
It's nice to see that he looks kinda asian now
INSERT $20 to Start Game
2:03 HORRIBLE finger animation - horrible! Just HORRIBLE
Обязательно пройду, только на ютубе)
Finally i havent got any words. Thats fantastic
My jaw was dropped the whole trailer
I won't buy a ps5 but I'll watch a YouTube series on this
a yeees the nurses are now on next gen graphics would love to see those juicy legs again
he looks like leon
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh snaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaap!!!!!!!!!!!!
NO WAY!!!!!!!! I’m so excited!!!
Dude i want to know if the music at 2:30 was made for the trailer or its a actual piece, because that was awesome.
Not even from a Japanese developer not to mention some of the original staff members. I'll pass.
Everything looks amazing. But… where is the dark? Is the most important thing.
Te quiero mucho Playstation
Hey about metal gear solid, is it possible to get something.
i hope doggo ending and NG+ isn't behind the paywall
This looks amazing!!!
Thought Id be a old lady before I saw anymore silent hill Games this is truly amazing and I can't wait !!
Konami; a company that tried to focus on phone gaming finally come to its sense... i hope...
Wow they're really trying to give Last of Last Us a run!
In the original, James doesn't look at himself,  he look on a player. So... The developers fully understand the game?
ps4😔😔
Silent hill 2, residente evil 4 y alone in the dark, regresan nuevamente los padres del terror. Que emoción.
Finalmente, mas ainda não superei o cancelamento do P.T
Why didn't you go with the best game in the series part 1 granted I'm no longer on PlayStation but you went with a weaker choice nothing new for PlayStation anymore though 😂😂🤷
Iam still playing it on my psp
1 Corinthians 10:14 Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry.
Can't wait to get the doggo ending in 4k.
i can't believe Leon Kennedy is in the newest Pokémon game. I can't wait to catch the new legendary depression!
So,is Konami back or not?I need to know!
So ironic that i was just playing silent hill 2 for these  past week and i frekin loving every second of the game  and this trailer was so random that i caught me off guard but guess it is the real deal.hope my kidney is of some worth so i cn afford PS5 🤡
I kept thinking they were about to play Paint it Black.
Hoy revivio el gaming gracias Playstation te amo
PS5 EXCLUSIVE
a konami não sabe fazer trailer
I don't get the same feelings I got back when Silent Hill and Silent Hill 2 were released. This looks more like Alan Wake, which I did enjoy as well. Time will tell.
llore
Exclusive?
wow this is nice wolcom back the game Silent Hill 2 remake😉2023 ps5
i'm not a fan of how James looks, especially since it looks like they just made him younger as compared to what we were given in  the PS2 edition and even that HD remake on PS3.     not a fan of him in the least for appearance, the atmosphere is amazing don't get me wrong but they dropped the ball on James.  i'm getting sick of all these remakes of remakes  that companies are doing now.   wait for the UHD 4K Difinitive upscale 250TB edition and they will include an extra pebble outside the well  on the way into the city
Where are the consoles ? Nothing in Italy 🤡
A friend of mine gave me the Silent Hill HD Collection, never got into it. But this game looks tight. 😇
Finally! Leon S. Kennedy on Silent Hill
I’m sorry but I don’t trust anything about this. No shot this is going to go well.
Looks like the combat system has improved from the original.  Only true fans will know the difference....meanwhile...some of us have to get a PS5 now 😭
Leon is that you ? Wkwk
Just give silent hill and mgs back to kojima
Seeing that cockroach at the start, my immediate thought (and hope) was that they were finally working on PT/Silent Hills again. But I'm FAR from disappointed from what I got.
When will you dang people finally give us the Legend of dragoon remake? Hmmmm??? 😡
Bloober Team went from unknown small studio to remaking Silent Hill 2 in 6 years.  It's almost impossible to imagine.
it's just a remaster. disagree, nothing interesting.
I’m happy they waited!! Now we get this remake in true next Gen form!! Looks amazing!
This looks amazing. Let´s give Konami a fair chance.. But playstation not. Wheres is my ps5 playstation?
Harry Mason is mad >:(
Not a bad move tbf, still doesn't forgive them for their blunder with Kojima's Silent Hill game
Geração 2000 pegou várias revoluções, coisa que só agnt teve a oportunidade de saber.
not impressed at all genuinely looks really cheap :/
wow
watafaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Был бы дед живой, от счастья б помер...
Finally glad this settles the debate on which people thought that "Abandoned" game was silent hill lol
PS2 revival era here we come O.O
Is really impresive the faces, look at the texture, when he is like rubbing his hands you can see how it moves, its unreal, and he looks realistic but you can tell its a game so it doesnt fell uncanny tbh i think they found the best style
I hope this remake works as a great tribute to what Silent Hill was and specially to the work of Team Silent, who were the ones that made this franchise so special.
Oh man the face look so bad like an ameature dev made a game with a build your own charachter
Hope we see dog ending in fulll 4k
Shut up and take my money now!!!!
The music on the old games was so spooky.
Silent pachinko is back!
When will Silent Hill 1 be made?
He will get a keyblade and go to another world
*running around screaming
The problem with silent hill is the gameplay. Also if they can they should remake undying, the greatest horror game ever.
Keşke remake'lere silent hill 2'den değilde şuan hiçbir şekilde oynanamayan silent hill 1'den başlasalardı. Ama şikayet etmiyorum ULAN SILENT HILL 2 REMAKE LAN!!! ANSKM!! DEHŞET
So excited for this that I literally was sobbing at the reveal lol
sadly i only have pc 😅
A new voice for James? Feel a bit weird to have James with an older voice now
Now bring back Castlevania
PS is the best
silencio gil nunca supe como se pronuncia.
Time to save up for that PS5, lol.
Hey Alright
James looks like David Lynch now lol
Actually a smart decision by Konami not to have Bloober Team make a new SH game, because let's be honest, they cannot top Kojima's one at this point. And do what has been popular these days, remake big titles in the past.  I hate Konami after what they did to this IP in the past, but yeah, gotta admit this here is a highly potential great business move.
Leon Kennedy in other universe
smile heart two
Lost count to how many times I have watched this. Getting a PS5 when this comes out. Loved the original and played it countless times when I was younger and still play it along with silent hill 3.  Cannot wait to relive it in a whole new way.
Can we get DAYS GONE 2 as well PLEASE!
Why don’t they do those games on phone
So James ist a blond Asian Dude now?
All I have to do is loop pyramid head for 5 gens and then I win,  EZ
Looks really bad 👎
They did it. Konami did the impossible. They actually listened to the fans.
Leon oh noooooooooooooooooo .
James looks like Sean Bean
the mirror scene kinda disappointed me. in the original i loved how they made half of his face virtually impossible to see but not so much that you wouldnt try to see something in the abyss. it was almost provoking in the original. to see that they kinda forgot that disappoints me, but i definitely wont let this dictate the quality of the rest of the game because i think its going to be awesome
Я ждал этот время и вот это время пришло!
I've just realized, that James doesn't have Guy Cihi's voice anymore... I loved his voice:( And his face is different... But anyway I'm extremely happy, that Konami is making the remake of this fantastic game. Hope, that in this way even more people will find out about this masterpiece
Silent of US, feat Paint it smoke soundtrack
Yamaoka and Ito are helping make the remake? Okay you have my attention
There was an empty hole in my heart, it´s gone now
Silent Hill hasn't had any new games in 23 years, and now Konami is going to fix that.
I’ve been waiting for 10 long years for another game, and this looks perfect 😍 Just let me pre-order already!!
Can't wait to play this for a minute and then close it from fear and watch other people play it on YT.
Doesn't need to be remade.
ok, one more wish 🤩
MAKE IT FOR PSSS44444 TOOOO BRAAAA
Ooopaa
Alright everybody calm down It's happening! It's back!
Leon Kennedy is now in Silent Hill?! THE CROSSOVER I NEVER KNEW I NEEDED.
Man Leon Kennedy’s looking rough these days…
Thanks Sony, we love you! Cry xbot..❤
😭😭😭 Al fin 💗
Проходила, пройду ещё раз, отличная игра
Yup. I cried.
Silent Hill 1 better be next unless they're stupid and don't want to make money.
I was hoping for a SH2-Remake...my alltime favorite horrorgame!! Finally! Hopefully they keep the music and the settings since those make the spirit of Silent Hill 2. We also need a PC-version of this since I don´t own a PS. James face looks diffferent, indeed.  Don´t like it that much compared to his "old" face but it will do the job.
Generation of remasters
Gosh, I am getting goosebumps rn
I hope its not 30FPS on PS5 like this stupid trend of a plague tale and gotham knights releasing games for next gen consoles at 30FPS in 2022/2023 .
This could be utter dogshit or great. I still don’t trust Konami enough.
They made James Sunderland look like a young David Lynch. Cool.
Ahh the game that make me cannot sleep a week
They better keep the doge ending
I know I'm kinda nitpicking but I vastly prefer Guy Chihi's original voice, the new voice is kinda too macho for a guy who isn't a hero in the game ( he doesn't really help anyone except Laura), all the game he is just trying to sort through his problem and the old voice really fit
Thank you Konami, this is a big worth for everyone who played the classic Silent Hill games including me ❤👏
👍👏🇲🇽🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟👈
Scared to see James pillow choking Mary in high quality graphics.
Please sony make a manhunt remake and i will buy a ps5
Weird beard
I'm happy that Markiplier is the face model for James. That's so awesome!
Literarily cried when I saw the trailer. favorite game of all time.
Thank you so much. I've been waiting years for this. Love the trailer but I want to see Mary, Maria and Angela. :(
Just imagine this game in VR🤤😲Thanks for being there. This is my favorite part.
Hmm??? i m sceptical??? i have the original silent hill 2 game in ps2 and x box classic!!! the original game frome 2001 is a masterpiece that original game has all and never forget the genius soundtrack frome the original game. Hmm but this here puhh i don t think it comes close to the original game frome 2001 its timless a masterpiece!!!
I just cried a bit......
Solo para ps5?? NO ME JODAN PUDRANSE
Khe
it looks generic
I really hope the keep the dark, gritty, almost dream like quality to the atmosphere. This looks a little too bright
So Shattered Memories was tge remake of Silent Hill 1?
Thanks Konami , thank you for giving me the desire to play again, I have felt that sensation again. Can’t wait for resident evil 4 too .
Finally
I'm kind of disappointed
il doit être comme un ouf rebeudeter
I Don know how many times I re watched the trailer
esperaba algo mejor, konami cada vez peor!
Silent Hill 1??
We Are All Ready
Take note, game devs, when making a horror game, focus on horror and not psychological horror. Two similar but very different subjects.
so does this mean that we're gonna see a metal gear solid remake announcement soon >.>
Meu Deus não acredito nisso.. Pedimos tanto por isso..
What does this mean?  "Playstation console exclusive* Not available on other formats for 12 months after release"  Is this Sony's new secret way of legally saying timed exclusive without saying it?  Just not sure what the asterisk means, but sounds like it isn't permanently exclusive.
Bruh they made James handsome
Xbox players :  *WASTED*
Where was Silent Hill 1?
konami back to making games? suikoden 3 remake pleasee
This game changed my entire prospective on horror. The best i have ever played.
So they gonna remake it on ps6 and ps7, etc…..😅
Woow remastered alien ending :D
Just play Silent Hill on PS1 and relax. They won't do anything right.
❤
też nagrywam o grach
Is this the game where everything is secretly controlled by a shiba inu?
Glad to finally revisit the SH realm.  Still wish Silent Hills got to see the light of day.
After 1:50, you can hear someone yelling at the background  "Yo, Leon! you're in the wrong game dude. You're supposed to be in Spain, not Silent Hill
science hills
So MGS remake is coming right???? Right??!
TAKE MY MONEY
I'd love to see remakes of this saga rather than the generic resident evil
Por favor, no lo arruines konami, no cancelaciones repentinas, no micropagos ni nada de eso. Solo un juego de terror con una de las mejores tramas de la vida!! Compra asegurada
YES  YEEEEEEEEES
Last time I was in Silent Hill was on my PSVITA with Book Of Memories. Now We Are Free
Honestly it could be a banger or the second lowest rated game on steam after pes 2022. I can't trust this company anymore
Guys stop complaining and be thankful to what we got, the work of this game is so awesome and will be new experience
finaly
Uff las enfermeras en 8k🥵🥵🥵
Head up  Chest out Silence I'm stressed out Be quiet Stressed out (X3)                                       -K. Dot
Ohh this is so great! ..^.^.. I wish they could realease for Ps4! It would be perfect!
listened to the Silent Hill 2 OST more times than I can count, so stoked they're bringing back Akira!
The new generation is in for a treat
When I played The Medium it felt like a little love letter to Silent Hill at points. They must be overjoyed to be remaking the best game in the series
leon when his old
Konami actually remembered one for their games collecting dust?! Ohhhh shheeeeiitttt
What is it with horror game sequels being remade instead of the original game?
These little moments are what I call.. happiness
NO WAYYY
<333
why does it look so obviously fake?
someone blow a fat vape
Anyone know the piano at 2:30 ?
Can't believe Konami decided it was time to make something else than a pachinko slot machine.
Eita 😬
Cockroach with ray tracing
This is now silent Town now silent hill
Esse Jogo é Insano
Nice"
Жегули мне в сарай! Какая прелисть!
El diseño de Pyramid Head no me convenció, me gusta más el que le recrearon en la película del 2006, hasta lo veo pequeño de estatura... no me convenció. Pero KEKW, madre mía con las enfermeras ahí si eh, ahí si se la curraron, de pie y un aplauso, después de Resident Village comprendieron bien que es lo que más hace atractivo a un videojuego con las nuevas tecnologías. Pero igual, un poco o no se, decepcionado con el cabeza buque.
Я ждал этот время и вот это время пришло!
Dunkey
REMAKE ⁉️⁉️⁉️
I wonder what Yahtzee will think of one of his favorite games being remade by two of his least favorite studios
من افضل الالعاب حقيقة
This has to be the best news in gaming history 👏
What everyone was expecting!!!! Thanks for listen us for all these years!!!!!
If You remake one you got to finish the job and do all
Just wet myself
Looks like they were inspired by the success of the RE2 remake.
Remake woow. Great
yo James! what is up with your face my dude?
Wooooow!
That comes from nowhere,i have no words...i play this game when i was depressed and this game have help me in this dark days of my teenager...it was the best writting silent hill on my opinion.
Where is sh 1 remake
Depressed Leon joining silent hill
Why Silent Hill 2? Why not do Silent Hill 1 then do 2?
So sick
This complete my childhood and fatal frame
FODA DEMAIS!
Where is kojima? 🤡🤡
Please don’t let me down like the rest of the gaming community 🤕
Beautiful Graphic
James said I’m ready are we all ready for the silent hill 2 remake
Dude, if the PT version released i will jump like a kid, but yeah its just a dream
Warum wird nicht erstmal mit SH1 angefangen? Wieso muss es immer mittendrin sein? Naja, immerhin ein erneuertes SH. Freue mich trotzdem drauf.
The music!!!! And we get the red pyramid too...wow.
I really hope this actually happens the last Silent Hill teaser never happened
Pero quieren que call of duty no sea exclusivo de xbox🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I've never understood why people complain about remakes because the original(whether it be a movie, game, etc) isn't going anywhere-- but with this game I have to admit I am a little nervous 😭 SH2 was lightening in a bottle. The uncanny animations and voice acting did so much for the game, and I wonder if they'll play it straight or try and emulate that in some way.
PT looked better not gonna lie lol
I’m glad silent hill is getting a remake. Played this as a kid on a summer and was lucky enough to find  all three games on sale, best horror summer I’ve had.
w h a t
Ich habe so lange auf das game gewartet, da kann ich auch nivh 1 Jahr länger warten!
nombre de la cancion
It’s always the ambient music for me!!!
Yeeeesssssss 😱😱😱😱😱😱
"I'm ready" To  Pre-order Now!
I’m going to cry!!!!!
I'm very excited for this and will absolutely buy it the moment it comes out... but why not start with Silent Hill 1, Konami?
In my restless dreams... I see that game... Silent Hill ...Finally♡
Is it done using UE5? If so I am not impressed.
This is the reason I'll be buying a ps5 now.   Can't fkn wait!
Sony 💙💙💙
Bring PT back…
After years konami make a New silent hill 2 but it is reboot or remake
Grande Leon K. de Silent Hill xD
PS4??
Thought that this was silent hill the song by Kendrick Lamar featuring Kodak black
oh myyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (@)_______(@)
Графика вообще не впечатляет, с такой графикой и на ps4 можно спокойно выпускать...
SH 1 please
when walking in the bathroom there was a yellow fire hydrant to the right of the telephone pole, when exiting, it’s seemingly gone. I hope details like this aren’t missed in the game 😢😅
better not be canceled
Hmm :l
my ps5 is so ready to this!!!
This is amazing.
Looks great! ..all that's missing is the excellent theme music. ..i have already play and completed SH2 back in the day on Playstation 2
It's back?!
Leon Kennedy in another universe of madness
the only game i was legit scared to play
alv tarde pero seguro.
На слезу пробило...
now remake METAL GEAR and METAL GEAR 2
Omfg. With any luck we'll see that Pachinko MGS remaster polished and ported. Konami games are back on the cards people. Yay.
What a legend !
Uhuuuuu
Nah bro you can’t fool us, we all know that this is a dream caused by drugs
So unreal engine 5 vibe
This makes me wanna try the original one on ps2
Stoop I don't believe this untill I see it getting released
Not excited at all...this game was great because it chose to innovate at the time.  Konami is stuvk in place.
I don't understand the point of remaking Silent Hill 2, the original was great as it is.
I've never played Silent Hill, but looks cool. To me it sounds a bit like Planet of The Apes
Love how they used the dialogue from James final encounter with Pyramid Head for the trailer.
can we expect a remake of Metal Gear Solid?????
Nahh I'm here still wait for PT
I've admittedly never played a Silent Hill game but this looks amazing! Hope this does what the RE2 Remake did for me with RE but for Silent Hill.
эх, не похож, роже не та, у того умнее была
Yeah! Why finish P.T. just because everyone wants you to?
бляяяяя КЛАССНО )))
This is the game that will make me get a PS5
Finally 🤘🤘🤘
No me lo puedo creer
It will either be a unoriginal 1:1 recreation, or a bastardized version of the original game, the actors look ugly too. They should have remade Silent Hill 1 not 2
León, eres tú??
me pase este juego hace como 2 semanas en ps2 y ahora sacan la remasterizacion sin yo enterarme de nada, es increible
Silent hill was so sad I miss it
That classic sentence: "In my restless dreams, I see that town, Silent Hill"
Yessssss
PS4 pro ???
Konami fired their CEO, now the new CEO got their company back on track. RIP PACHINKO CEO
Esse jogo é espetacular, o Jogo tá lindo
I'd buy a PS5 just to play this.
Never stopped believing this day would come😭😭😭 The great return... It looks amazing, and Akira-san is not gonna disappoint I just know it! The new James looks kinda funny with that hairstyle and hair color though, maybe that’s just me😂 He kinda reminds me of Remus Lupin.  Edit: Mary’s voice kinda misses that sadness that sets the tone of the game, maybe it’s not gonna be that bad in the game. But wish they brought the og Mary/Maria voice for this💔
finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yamaoka & Ito are back. The True Roots of Silent Hill is back.
Esta parte de mi vida... esta pequeña parte se llama "felicidad"
Locked doors, now in 4k with 60fps
"In my restless dreams, I see that town. Silent Hill. You promised me you'd take me there again someday. But you never did."
If it's a hill, why is there fog?
Ayo what
“Gotta bank on Pyramid Head! Let’s skip remaking SH1 and go right to SH2.”
чипай говорил, что Джеймс выглядит на 40, и он не ошибся, здесь он точно выглядит так
Leon???
yes YES YEEEEEEEEEEEES
Finally!!!!🥹
Leon S. Kennedy in Silent Hill?
FODE MEU CU PLAYSTATIONNNNN.
Silent Hill holds a special place in my heart I hope they do it justice definitely one of my favorite games ever
I hope the game P.T comes back, scary but fun yk
graphics are too clean and smooth. silent hill is supposed to be grimy and rusted.
Is this a pachinko game?
Lol imagine if this is a new PT version
I'm ready.
q rico causa
after playing P.T so many times watching this teaser really puts a smile on my face
I remember this...
❤️
Is this the original PT?
I’m carefully excited for this game. Blooberg is not that great of a studio so I’ll wait for reviews
the best horror game of all time
Just wait a little while they cancel this game as well
The nostalgic music of Yamaoka😌
Finally! I will play this.
YES, YES, YES!!!!!
Silent hill is really one of the games of all time !
This is going to be the most awesome looking Pachinko machine ever!!!
This looks very not great...
Pyramid head looks so funny
boring, thats all.
Thank you Konami for bringing back a series that I have missed for so long this looks amazing I can't wait.
I've been waiting for eight years😭😭😭.
As a DDR fan, it warms my heart to see Akira Yamaoka in the credits.
это лимитка на пс или на пк она будет?
yes take my money please!
Do we know if its real time or pre rendered? 🧐👍👍👍
0:14 - 0:35 this whole sequence makes me really worried about this remake. In the OG the game starts and James is just there staring at the mirror, he feels aloof and detached, you can tell there is something wrong with him but you can't tell exactly what. With the remake it is crystal clear that something bad just happened. I don't trust bloober one bit.
the eerie bad voice acting was what made this game so mind warping and now its gone lol
Masahiro Ito! I can't wait to Abstract Daddy teriffing me again!
pathetic and nothing special in this teaser, bring Hideo Kojima back to Silent Hill - he is the only one that can make this game terryfing
Still better than Adipurush
Okay, legitimately shaking all over now. My most favourite game is making a comeback.
I can’t wait for this!!!!!
so this is where Ethan Winters has been
Still wonder what silent hills would have been like.
It is a TIMED exclusive for those wondering.
It's like you're reunited with a familiar vibe
Only when P.T. was screwed up by KONAMI.
Unreal engine 😂 wth konami even p.t was on the fox engine
The voice acting should've been more amateurish
James💪
we are ready for back in action!
Wow this is really happening and it’s not for gambling this time 😮😮 and it’s not a horrible HD remaster.
Wait this is for real?
This is something many didn't expect.
sony sende ps5 pro'yu duyurda bu oyunu güçsüz ps5 de oynamayalım.......
Can't believe that they did it! They really brought it back!
Se eles entregarem isso que eles tão prometendo no Trailer. Vai ser o Jogo Mais Lindo do Mundo pra bater de frente com o RE4 Remake
A strong candidate for GOTY
I'm interested, but not convinced. It looks like they're going more into conventional drama than the dreamlike strangeness of the original.
Rip Xbox
Cautiously optimistic for this remake! Looks absolutely gorgeous!
Konami, where Silent Hill 1????!?!!!!
This might just be what will revitalize the Silent Hill projects. Hope they would make P.T a full game after this game blows up
Sin duda un clásico y de los mejores de terroe
i remember when i just too afraid to play this game when i still a kid.
Leon looks kinda depressed
I gotta say, despite James emoting waaaay more than the original, it feels very true to him. We weren't gonna get Guy Cihi again, but this is pretty great.
tf is the voice acting
Безруков?
What a beautiful thing
You can actually see the despair on his face. That is attention to detail
hope Sleeping dogs will return too
And here's me, just finished the original game
If only I could find a PS5 to play it on
it literally brings back childhood memories!
I just played the original silent hill 2 on my PS2 a few months ago after a long. Never in a million years I would've thought a remake for my all time favorite horror game would be announced! I wonder if Pyramid Head will make me lose me mind again? I hope this remake is done properly.
im cooming
Лютое хавно Времена уже не те что бы играть в такое. Только для истинных фанатов сайлент хила
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG FINALLY OMGOMGOMGOMG
Bloober Team at it again ey? I´m curious how this went down business wise for them to get the license to do this project I just hope they don´t try to modernize the game too much - horror is a niche market after all with very difficult customers...
Ps5 babyyy ❤️😋😋
Need to get a PS5 lol
Делать новую часть бесполезно. Если есть Silent hill 2
Revive el gaming
Can't wait :)
Finally 😭😭
not been excited for a horror game in years till this popped out
where is showecase?
Everything looks awesome but the character looks so different, they should make him younger and similar to the real one ..
Походу выйдет кривая, глуповатая и безыдейная копирка SH2 причем очень не умелая копирка
Thank you Konami finally!!!!!!!! 😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😫
its real?
without Kodzima it's not a silent hill
Metal Gear Solid 3 (With Hideo's name on the box art) next??
where silent hill 1?
Voy a revivir mi pesadilla otra vez pero a 4k XD
Is it just me or does the main protagonist look like Leon from resident evil
Looks great, but I can already hear all the butthurt fans talking about how Konami ruined their childhood because this or that got changed. You can’t compete with nostalgia.
Jwowoshskakksjdnemalxojsnanalxowjwbsnwoskeke YooOoOo
Remake again 😮‍💨😫
Music ☑️ Graphics ☑️ But Mary's letter could be as heartwrenching as the original?
Que grande Playstation bien caramelo con silent hill 2
Really not helping your case about Microsoft and having exclusive anything. Typical sony
James look so weird 🤣
Can't wait to be terrified by Pyramid Head and Silent Hill all over again.
The constant sadness on James's face is shocking. this will be beautiful
perfect
My ps2 copy is finnaly gonna get a friend
Ну хз... посмотрим, жаль что не Норман Ридус
Let’s just hope Konami doesn’t lose the source code this time
Wooo
Gamers that destroyed The Medium will call this a masterpiece😂😂😂
FINALLY
You know if they didn't show the nurses people wouldn't have cared.
Can. Not. Wait. Can we hope for VR support??
🎖
🔥
Wow this James face loks like a mentaly broken man it fits so perfect its scary. If they give the whole game this much detail it will be a old Horror with new face. I love it
Can’t wait to finally try out the classic
Finally thank u Konami
Two Silent Hills????
So long as the virus that is Tomm Hulett stays far and away from this production then theres some hope for this remake to preserve the integrity of what made the original an artistic masterpiece.
Is this gonna be a ps5 exclusive?
Everyone, see you In Water.
Ohhhhhh gracias Konami, no veía el día llegar 😱😭🙏🏼
😭😭😭nooooo why ps5 only 😭
This is just so bad, it looks very cheap.
Still till this day if I hear a siren all I think about is Slient Hill. It gives me chills just thinking about Slient Hill 1 and opening when you are chasing after Cheryl. Such a great video game.
Between this and Suikoden, Konami is back!
I've wondered for years why I'm still alive - THIS GAME IS THE REASON!
i wait this a half my live
Why didn't they give this remake to a Japanese studio?
bruh james’ face was stung by bees? 🥴
Antitrust join the chat
😍
Interesting  THIS era From consoles  are from remakes/remasters
This and Suikoden... is a Vandal Hearts remaster on it's way too?   Konami... suddenly, we love you!!!!
How can you play when you still have a ps5 haha
IMHO, the cockroach in P.T. was more realistic looking
New pachinko movie looks amazing!
You see it too?  For me, it's always like this.
I would still rather have Silent Hills.
Τwin perfect will be rolling in their graves!
New pachinko?
With all of the remakes that have been coming out within the last few years it's sad that no one has remade "The Suffering"
Looks great. Pyramid head is looking as creepy as ever.
If you guys are excited about this, check out "Silent Hill 2 + PS2 Menu" it's such a relaxing and tranquil sound that's perfect for sleeping or just resting in general!
the return of masterpiece , take my money Konami
For years I’ve been googling randomly “silent hill updates” or “silent hill news,” and now… it’s here 😢. After all this time it is real…..
Дождались, мужики, осталось дожить
James really looks like Troy Baker in this
А на ПК не будет вообще?(
and where is silent hill 1?
Bring it to PS4 too
leon after re
If the game doesn't have the dog ending, I'm gonna refund it.
Will this be the RE 7 for the Silent Hill series?
I'll gladly visit Silent hill again to hear those sweet sweet tunes again
Never played silent hill.
OMFG. Absolute favorite game of all time. Spent a lot of time wandering that town. Haven't had to many games hit me like the original SH2 did. James looks a little different, so many remakes I hope this one is done proper.
ps exclusive   such dich eck bock
PlayStation overpricing everything rn, think I might just get it on PC
My body is ready.....TIME TO GO SILENT
Never thought I'd see the day Komani remembered they make games.
Guess James remembered his promise ❤
Yesssssssssssssssssssssssss , finalyyy
Lets fcking GOOOOO!!!!
Not on PC? Muda
Gosh. GOSHGOSHGOSH. I've lived enough long to wait for the teaser! Never thought that it was possible
Arriba el Toluca 🎉
I hope they keep the choice mechanics that determined the different endings without telling the players. It was clever and ahead of its time.
Whaaaat? No way. We get to see James get aboslutely railed by Pyramid head in HD
The queen of hills and horror game is bck. Thanks Konami, looking forward to it.
PCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPCPC
never beaten it on ps2
Welcome home !! 😌😌😌
Nah i like the one for ps2
I want metal gear solid back. Right noooooow.
even after taking perspective into account, that's a huge cockroach
Nice pachinko 🥵
PS5 only Yes! of course on PC but they make it exclusive not thinking in other consoles.
Im on fiiireeeeee🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can’t wait to hear what Yahtzee makes of all this.
I'm going to have a great time watching theradbrad play this
Stupid game...
I never played The Originals should I get this?
Al fin🥺 like si crees que el prota se parece a León versión viejito
Let’s make new games.
Finally 😍🔥
¿Quien me regala una PS5?
jim cryan 😢
PS4 ?
Took them long enough
Looks incredible
Another remake....ughhhh.....JUST MAKE PT GOSHHHDAMMNIT
0:42 In the original, James' eyes were darkened and if you increase the brightness to the maximum, he looked directly at the player through the mirror.
I think im crying
What Leon is doing in sillent hill?
Finally! We have to watch this trailer from time to time so we don't think it was the same dream we had of this game being revived the last 21 years 🤣🤣🤣
My favourite game of all time getting a remake, I honestly never thought it possible. I played the enhanced editon last year so I cant wait for the remake, so far im blown away!
Konami ressurgindo das trevas ?
AND WINDOWS??????
Im gonna buy ps5 just to play this legendary game that ever exist.
wait till Konami cancel this after teaser trailer
This is just the trailer for their pachinko silent gill 2 slot machine
Time to revisit Silent hill
Play station exclusive game  that's lame pc gamer all so grav for this.
is this gonna be one of those RE4-over-the-shoulder- style games?
Ooooo 👀
They should have played the Theme of Laura in this
October 20 - 14:27.   After a stressful work day -  I open YouTube   - I see Silent Hill 2 - Official Teaser   it caught me like 👁️ 👄 👁️
James?! what have they done to my boy?!
Kinda odd.....but the PS2 intro graphic still much more better than this....especially when James watch himself in the mirror
Since when Leon moves to silent hill???
Ps4
Погоди, это реально ?
Will this be next gen only title and ps exclusive? ngl kinda sad
how to make a Konami game:insert bloober team, remove soul, think about pachinko
This looks amazing 🤩
correct me - the fog was included to combat draw distance issues
espero que seja exclusividade pro PS5! ai boto fé.
This game will be incredible. Except I don't have a ps5, and I will not get one, and I can't afford one
ＩＲＡＱ 🇮🇶⃤ＩＲＡＱ 🇮🇶⃤ＩＲＡＱ 🇮🇶⃤ＩＲＡＱ 🇮🇶⃤ＩＲＡＱ 🇮🇶⃤ＩＲＡＱ 🇮🇶⃤ＩＲＡＱ 🇮🇶⃤ＩＲＡＱ 🇮ＩＡＩＲＡＱ 🇮🇶⃤ＩＲＡＱ 🇮🇶⃤ＩＲＡＱ 🇮🇶⃤ＩＲＡＱ 🇮🇶⃤Ｉ🤘😏ＲＡＱ 🇮🇶⃤ＩＲＡ
Suicide ending sounds pretty interesting 👀👀
R.I.P.P.T.
Wow. Bloober and Konami. I'm calling it now, this is gonna be trash. We needed Kojima to make a Silent Hill game, and I'm not gonna waste another dollar on anything bloober team touches.
This looks more real than any Marvel show rn
James Sunderland looks a lot like the guy from Death Stranding now? Have they used his looks for the game?
These past few days watching my crypto portfolio decline is very disheartening. Holding doesn't really profit much. Any idea on how to earn better on the short run
Also Sony: its unfair if MS gets Activision, because of exclusives. 😅😅
Ps5 exclusive? Rlly?? La concha del mono.
Wanted new SH but this is still fantastic news, they're still alive.
Muito foda !
Why his face looks like using snopchat sad filter?
I didn't like bloober's Blair Witch interpretation of their own video game, so I am worried how much this remake will get redesigned but Akira Yamaoka's name is a relief.
Finally remake
Aaaah!!!!
Bro why only on the ps5 tho now I got to get it
LIKE 👍
Pense que no veria este juego en mi tiempo de vida, gracias konami ♥
I'm happy that a new generation can experience this game but I doubt it will be able to recapture the horror and emotional intensity of the original
Silent Hill best components were the music, atmosphere and how the horror actually meant something meaningful and personal. Hopefully they can capture that.
Trailer is in 60 frames. Will the game be in 60 frames?
😭Literarily cried when I saw the trailer. favorite game of all time.
Shame it's PlayStation exclusive. Had a feeling it would be. Says timed exclusive but so was other games and never came to xbox.
when is this classic remake coming out?
Paint it black theme🤣
When konami rises again with some childhood memories.  😭
So excited 🔥❤
How did we never get an animated movie or series like they've done for resident evil
How is a man walking with a triangle clam shell over his body scary?
maybe Dino Crisis can back like this ? konami please
Goosebumps every 3 seconds
She said it! She said the thing!
Silent Hill 2: "Hey, can I copy your homework?" Halo: "Sure, but make it look different so the teacher doesn't notice." 0:35:
Exclusive for PS5 only
Блин... не впечатлило(((
Very handy , about time playstation, now do the right thing and give us days gone 2 please X
I love silent hill vibe cant wait to play
cant wait to experience dog ending in 4k 60fps
WAIT IS ACTUALLY REALL?!?!
"Playstation console exclusive" "Also available on PC" What?
James looks like Leon from RE2R.
Is this real?💀
Yesssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now I’m hyped again Done that on ps1 now it brings back memories
Whatever happened to PT?  Was it scrapped entirely?  Also, this is a smart remaster/remake.   Old games need this treatment.  Not games released within the last decade.
Gives me chills every time 👌🏻
silent hills
Thank You, Konami ... but where the freak is Metal Gear Solid!!??
Whoa . . My favorite horror game after Resident Evil, my memory flashback in 20 years ago 👍🏻
in my restless dreams, i see that town, silent hill
finally konami doing right thing for one but i hope is release  ps4 and ps5
KONAMI IS BACK FROM THE ASHES!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally
So hyped for this remake, no way it's as scary as the OG thow
Can we also get SH1 and 3 remade too please? Kthnx
Yesssss. I don't have to track down the original now
Okay Konami if you’re ready to come back the fans have been waiting, if this goes well Castlevania and Metal Gear Solid still deserve to come back as well
The Pyramid Head is back 😈
Let's goooooo  finally silent hill 2 is back but James doesn't look like a loser this unfamiliar XD
На пк бы обязательно перенесли, сразу же!!!!!!!
Just waiting for metal gear solid now…💯☝🏾
I'd rather they didn't have a remake at all but a proper remastered version. So sick of remakes of our beloved games.
I have a big smile in my face and probably looking like an idiot in the middle of the office right now!!!!
Remastered Leon Kennedy is appeared to save Slient Hills Franchise
Сидит мальчик на утёсе и плачет. К нему подходит дядя и спрашивает. - чего ты плачешь? - у меня родители с утёса упали.( - дядя расстёгивает ширинку и говорит… - сегодня явно не твой день
Got zero confidence in Bloober. Their handling of horror is.... shaky at best. This trailer already doesn't inspire confidence. Overly melodramatic and without a single essence of the Lynchian stylings of the original (original SH2 is a Lynch experience in all but name).
second comment. I can't wait. lol
Ethan?
This is the best thing i saw in the last 5 year, lol.
Sony, why'd you force this into being a console exclusive for the PlayStation? I believe more games would be happy to experience this game, be it Xbox or a cloud version for the Switch. You know, just like Call of Duty would continue to be supported on PlayStation should Microsoft buy it.
As a game, 1 million people watched the trailer in 10 hours. Silent hill 2🖤
This is why I have the PlayStation 5 because of all the great exclusives,keep it up Sony.
Horror land with 1000 monsters, ash and rain... Their hair and clothes look like they are straight out of the salon and clothing store. Even their shoes are squicky clean XD
I've been waiting for you.
2:44 drunk me with my buddies, at 3am, having found a traffic cone in the streets ...
Silent hill remake?
Why does James Sunderland look like Hugh Abbot
Im not sure if ps5 will run this at 60 fps stable, but PC will do it.
Check the boot of the car, James.
We'll see. Let's not forget this is Konami we're talking about.
Ура победа…
💩💩💩
Unbeatable still the best survival sadness horror game ever made
It’ll never live up to the hype that PT (Silent Hills) had. Bold move, Konami. Let’s see if it pays off for ya.
Wow, some serious 2001 flashbacks there. Game looks stunning 👏
i hope this blows up, and we get to see a proper Silent Hill 1 Remake.
Finally.. konami having its throne back in suspense horror game thats freaking awesome.. in a modern powerful machine..
We need this for xbox!
ياقليلين الادب  فخورين بنفسكم يوم حصرتوها ؟ سود الله وجيهكم انتم واللي يشد على يديكم
Silent hill was the only game I couldn't play as a kid
Leon smoked so much red herb he'e wondered into silent hill.
Questo titolo rimarrà nella storia!(forse😂🙌🏻🤷🏻‍♂️)
Una parte de mi infancia y la ilusión/felicidad que tenía por aquellos años volvió a renacer.
Can't wait to play for 7 minutes again. Get scared. Then play again after a couple weeks or so
Yeah, I think I won't get myself hyped over this.  It is Konami after all.
for me silent hill has the best music in any video game
наконец то
While I am sad we will never get Kojima’s Silent Hills, I think this is the right move. Kojima kinda got lucky that we are living in the age of remakes.  I Wonder if we’ll get those Metal Gear Solid remakes ever, it’s a series that’s sorely missed on the PS5 right now, outside of V.
Finally this happened! Looks really cool! Like RE Remakes treatment. Sad there no remake of Silent Hill 1.
Silent hill 1 and 3 remake please
It was about time we got one
yeeeeeeesss
KONAMI!! Please change the face of James, so he looks more then the original one, before it's too late. Everything else is just great.
Do not lose the rustic feel
I want silent hill 1
Very hyped for this 🔥
Nice nice nice!
They failed the mirror scene and i will not talk about the chara design or the 3rd person camera. But why they chose theses loosers of BOBBER studio?!
❤️❤️
The Worst case is becoming Reality.  Blooper make Silent Hill a Mid Game, like there other games. Silent Hill has deserved  Some Better Devs.
Any reason why they haven’t started the remakes with 1? Or am I Missing something?
Mai dimenticherò il piramide testa sotto quella luce rossa dietro le sbarre negli appartamenti. Uno dei miei primi giochi per PlayStation… brividi al solo ricordo
Increíble 🧐🍷
Nice I'm going to get the re4 remake and maybe when I'm finished with that I'll get a ps5 so 2026
Finally silent hill come back to life
Silent hill 2 remake they did resident evil now it’s silent hills turn the best game series ever
You mean they're actually putting work into a silent hill and not making some lame arcade game??? It looks awesome!
I never played silent hill before do this is perfect!
2:04 is that a Bonelab reference?
Miss metal gear yet?
LEON what happened to your wife ???
Ps5 🤮
Silent Hill 2 Remake Announced From Mateusz Lenart, Creative Director & Lead Designer at Polish 🇵🇱 Bloober Team Studios.. Bloober Team, expressed their intentions to remake the game while also modernizing it.  "To put it simply, our goal is to make everything that made the game a timeless classic, but delve even deeper into the foggy streets of Silent Hill," said director Mateusz Lenart, who previously served as creative director of The Medium.
Uma nostalgia absurda bateu agora!!
Great hope its a Playstation Exclusive.
wasn't the pyramid head guy a metal head or mask on pyramid form?? they changed it for a cheap wool mask... so it is a not buying...
Don't forget it's Konami - not Kojima.
Holy
Yesssss silent hill!!!!!!
OH MY GOD!...I CAN'T BELIEVE MY FREAKING EYES DUDE
Um sonho se tornando realidade. 😍🖤🖤🖤🖤
Glad I have a PS5 now because my PC would never run this.
he look like older Leon?
Looks great. If I only had a PS5.
After what they did to PT, the only thing that will make me play this is the being developed by Blooper and the return of Akira. But the voice acting of the teaser, horribiru
In the darkest of the day, my man remain clean shave
😍
Welcome back 🔥🔥😍
Not so scary trailer just because evil within used all those horror elements 🤔
We want a ps4 version too, silent hill 2 is the best in ps4 has a lot of funs
Sorry silent hills
Noo not again ...
What made this game amazing (and many other SH) was the music from Yamaoka. I hope they mind the soundtrack as much as they did.
let's thanks DBD and behaviour for reviving Silent Hill
is this real?
holy sh...
finally ❤️💐
Haunting to see this incredible game making a comeback, I cannot wait!
Уолтер Салливан выполнил ритуал "21 тайнство"
Classic!😍
0:28 - that's not how my skin behaves when I touch it like that!
Konami
Olha OS GRAFICOOS 🔥🔥
Вот только что у него с лицом?
YESSSSSSSSSSS
Балдёёёж!
Leon s kennedy ?😅
Why didn't they start from the original Silent Hill game?
Solo rezo porque no manchen el buen nombre de Silent hill 2 y hayan hecho algo a la altura
Let’ssss gooooo
Were is the Slot Machine of silent hill 2!?  Konami how can you do this to me a actual game!
2:29 sounded like WINTER SONATA FROM THE BEGINING TILL THE END ost
Wonder if the doge ending is in this version
Estou ansioso. Gostei da maneira que a expressão do personagem mostra desespero e tristeza. Só espero que eles não tentem renovar e mudar alguma coisa da história, mas, pelo trailer, parece que não.
Aee cacete, até que enfim ❤️
Is this real or scam? I mean do i have to wait like 10 years just to hear It won't come out or is this for real for real?
Excuse the question, but I'm new to the franchise and the game looks amazing. Is this a remake of the original game or is it a completely new one? Regardless of the question, I'll be playing the originals these days.
Had a rough morning and as soon as I got on yt and saw this recommended I started shaking with excitement!!! All this SH news has just made my whole day and now my husband is about to get his ears talked off about it 🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️
Where the heck is Silent Hill Part 1? Did I just missed it?
Made by Konami so it's a no from me
_Congratulations to Konami for respect with Fãs_
Xbox🧡
In my restless dreams..i see that town..silent hill.
Leon Kennedy looking sick here!!
Je viens de finir de me le refaire sur PS2 y a deux semaines en étant pas au courant de ça. Incroyable ça me donnerais presque envie d’acheter la ps5 rien que pour ça 😂
Not Norman Reedus, don't care
Please please please theme of Laura and the original soundtrack better be in it.
Cant wait for Mutahars opinion on this
slot machine game?
Not a fan of the voice acting and the subtle changes to cutscenes, but the locations themselves look excellent- as is always the case with games from this developer. My expectations are at a firm "maybe."
As a big fan of the old Silent Hill games I'm probably going to play this but I'll be honest here: I'd be MUCH more excited about a completely new regular SH game (maybe Silent Hill 5). I realise that 2 is reputed to be the best game of the franchise but if they really HAD to do a remake, it might have made the most sense to create a modern version of the original Silent Hill.
Greatest horror franchise of all time.
When this game doesn't sell well, Konami is just going to go back to not making games again
pt
Game of the Year.
Today we are witnessing a historical event 🧔‍♀
0:38 that face, bruh
Enough with time exclusives! Those are not "for the gamers", but ONLY for your cash registers. Produce the entire game, and make it full exclusive (or console exclusive, at least), not just a useless time exclusive.
Nothing can beat the atmosphere of silent hill from old consoles
Konami and Silent Hill? It's been a while, since something like this happened before. What a epic reveal right here! 👏
Silent Hill Look Like Alan Wake
А где графен, почему всё такое блёклое или это стиль такой сомнительный?
Great trailer. This could (and should) be brilliant, but it's Bloober Team, so they might still mess it up. We'll see. Fingers crossed.
Trust me its going to be a quick cash grab for money just like most remakes
Yeeeeessss🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥PS5 ❤❤❤❤
PlayStation is the only next gen console WITH GAMES 💙
Always nice to see triangle head in 4k
Quiero morir
The music is just amazing in this trailer
Hopefully political correctness doesn't stick its nose. And it can and it can't.
Rip ps4 user
me dió un órgano
Inject this into my f*king veins.
Monopolio, monopolio
slay
The best game of horro is back  I never though Konami will do again.  I need meta gear 1 remake and I  will have so  Happy
Polish studio meh......
Can't wait to see them nurses hehehe
i'll buy a PS5
Omfg i want to play this game now
Awsome!😉👍🏼
This is mind blowing. I grew up with the original but this is epically beautiful graphics. who is he saying that he doesn't need anymore? Will this only be on the PlayStation platform? I haven't owned a console in a long while. May have to rethink that if this is really happening? I will be having restless dreams about this.
Let's remember what we said before:   DUCK KONAMI
Ok. It's cool and all but.... What about silent Hill **1** remake?
Does this have anything to do with PT ?
Hopefully it won't be with fixed camera angles
Gonna be free aswell? Wanna sell my ps5 with it installed when it unlaunches
Wow, this honestly looks... Terrible. Hiring Bloober Team was a mistake as well, and knowing them, in addition to bad graphics there will be horrible optimization (Medium says hello) and probably bad gameplay as they have never done any combat before iirc. Their best game was Observer and every other was mediocre at best, in my opinion. Keeping my expectations very low for this one. Silent Hill F however looks interesting.
I remember this one, they showed that PT trailer and then kept us waiting for almost a decade and they ended up with giving us that walking simulator called "Death stranding"
wooooow.. this looks great! I only got through maybe 20% of this on the ps2 long ago and never knew why i didnt pick it back up. But i will 100% be playing this on ps5
ЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕБББББАААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААААТТТТТЬЬЬ ЧТООООООООООООООООООООООООООООООООООООООООООООООООООООО
wow
Хм, много сайлентхилов стало, там еще Silent Hill f должен выйти, тизер есть
Bring back silent Hill PT you preks
Nice to see a game coming to a console you cant even buy even if you had the money : D
Just when I decides I would continúe with Silent Hill 2 this comes out. Blessed
My Dream!!!
Day one!
I can't believe it. Silent hill 2 is back !?! One of the greatest game of all time is back.
James is  Domhnall Gleeson???
Imagine if they left this just like p.t
Bro pyramid head.....
poor James is subjected to drugs look if face haha ​​I even think he is Leon SK's uncle
I hope the re make homecoming
can we expect this maybe early 2023?
Oh wow, Konami is making a game based on their pachinko machines! ;P
😱🤩👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Oh cool this is based on their Pachenko series
The team behind the medium and layers of fear. Its gonna be fire
I have LOVED Bloober Team's previous work, especially the writing. But I've always found the gameplay lacked some polish. As an independent studio, they had to focus their efforts where they could. Now, with the full backing of Konami, I hope they will be able to truly shine.
Where is castlevania PS5
Really looking forward to this, I played the original over 20 years ago , but my wife asked me to get rid of it as the music was scaring my boy, obviously never played in front of him but we had dog at the time who loved headphones and TV remotes. I only ever got about halfway through it, and now my child is a man he can't wait for it himself, so ya definitely excited about this and silent hill F. Never thought I would see the day hopefully they remake all the silent hill games.
I want also mgs 6
Where is SH 1 🤔😳
Some games should never be remade....
Ay no tengo miedo yo
Pero, y el 1?
O.M.G! I litteraly shrieked like a little girl.❤❤❤❤❤
James should be not that handsome, he should be ugly/ average like on the PS2 version
This trailer is very impressive, and very faithful to the original game. SH2 is one of my favorite games, and I can't wait to put my hands on this remake.
As long as Bloober stay faithful to the original vision, I can't see how this could be a bad game.
WAIT IS THIS ACTUALLY REAL?!
Nice…..can’t wait.
Can‘t beliebe we‘re finally getting this
POLSKA GUROM!
It's been 21 years , what a time to be a gamer. welcome back old friend.
Is this really happening? I still have it on the ps1!! 😱😱😱
hmmm idk, silent hill 2 is a perfect game with best horror atmosphere ever (best to experience on ps2) i really hope they’ll be able to capture it
I can't believe it ! It's coming !!
The ending of that game has never left me.
You are still beautiful as the day I lost you ❤️‍🩹
No way 😭
I MUST HAVE THIS!!!!!!!!
NOT ANOTHER REMAKE MAKE SOMETHING NEW
Markiplier as James Sunderland
The music of the original one is much better, plus I don't understand why they changed the main character's face...
Yes! Finally!!
Fraco
Wait, is this that PT thing, like...THAT PT?. PS: I don't know anything about silent hill.
SILENT HILL IS STILL ALIVE ❤️❤️THANKS KONAMI
I like how you all are falling for the “take it to another studio” again.
I dont understand why people like this series so much? Is it just a nostalgia thing?
Did Konami wake up from their gambling induced stupor?
The instrumental almost sounded like paint it black
I want it!
James!
This game is so twisted. New generation is up for a ride
Rule34 here we go
Release this on pc like all the other PlayStation exclusives... PLEASE!
I'm disappointed. I expected a pachinko.
Kojima, guillermo del toro junji ito where?
This isn't right
코나미는 싫은데 게임은 기대돼네.
I hope you guys understand how important it is that Akira Yamaoka is back. This game would not feel the same, nor would the original without him. This is a dream come true.
how many pachinko machines y'all think are gonna be in the game 😂
whats the name of the tune?
N O P E
Leon old version.
Надеюсь они используют все возможности геймпада.
cone on we need mgs now
Wow i really dont know what to say 😅
Ok konami, and now GIVE US METAL GEAR SOLID !!!!!!!!!!
This is coming from the team that made Tedium, sorry I meant the Medium. 😩
Welcome to Centralia, Pa!!
When he's looking in the mirror and touching his high res, insaneley textured face, it's almost like he's as shocked to see it as we are.
This really isn't a dream? And we will see a remake of SH 2, I can't believe it.
I’m already wondering how they are going to shoehorn micro transactions in.
I am looking forward for this 😊 And hopefully they will also do it to Silenthill 4 🙏
Silent hill f and SH2😯
Блин. Жаль, что на ps5, а главный герой как-то больше стал похож на Леона Кенеди из RE2 или доктора Биркина на минималках. Выглядит не так зловеще, как раньше. А там посмотрим, но очень жду. Очень странно, что сначала не прееиздали 1 часть( Хотя... и так много было переосмыслений на 1
never played any of the silent hill games growing up, but ya boy ready for this,  and impeccable graphics on a ps5 system? let's get it!
Wow! This looks awful
No way. I dont believe it.
PT2
Bueno, si silent hill 2 es exclusivo por 12 meses, entonces, call of duty rambien seria exclusivo por 12 meses para las consolas de Xbox? Competencia desleal, o competencia justa.
these comments are wild lol. I'm hyped though 💯
No Xbox? Ok, no COD then 😎
James' voice sounds almost exactly like the voice of the protagonist of the Alchemilla mod. Are they the same people?
Resident evil 4 remake ... now this ??? OMFG
Раньше туман нужен был для экономии ресурсов, а сейчас для атмосферы 😁
I hope rule of rose & haunting ground gek remake
I just don’t trust Konami. I’m extremely sceptical about this.
ps only? i hope call of duty will be xbox only some day.
Finally Konami does something right. Still hate what couldve been with P.T
❣️❣️❣️❣️
holyyyy shiiiii
I wish there was more stories about silent hill and raccoon city these are cities of untold stories
I must be as high as a kite, cuz I’m seeing Silent Hill 2?
Idk but to say microsoft is anticonsumer this because of exclusives is ridiculous when you have thisr and ff7 remake just to name 2.
Oh yeah! Leon Kennedy is back!
don't see why they made this a ps exclusive for 12 months we have been waiting 10 years for this and now we have to wait another 12 months😢
I've seen 3 different silent hill game trailers already  today. Whats going on.
BULLY 2 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
YEOOOO i hope this an actual horror game 😪
Please Remake Dog ending too.
Now they need to remake silent hill 3. I need it
Silent hill 2 ?? When is silent hill 1?
this was supposed to be part of the playstation showcase
So glad those leaked video of silent Hill was fake
I cried a little.
I dunno, bloober team games are average, and i set my expectations low for this one
هلا هلا
I bet it will be more like spooky movie than horror game it should be
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS 😭❤️❤️❤️
Shame that they gave James the generic action hero voice that mumbles every word. But apart from that, this looks fantastic! A dream come true
Será que sai mesmo ?
I think I broke the "like" button.
Best game ever
What about PS4 ??
P.T?
Um remake do silent hill 2 era o que eu mais queria
As a Metal Gear Solid fan I’m extremely jealous and depressed..    But also very happy for Silent Hill fans
yessssss
The credits for Masahiro Ito and Akira Yamaoka warmed my heart. It's sad to see different face and voice for James, but hopefully it's executed well.
so we lived all to this day
if this was a movie and not a game i wouldn’t be upset
Never felt more scared to own a ps5
The Master of Horror Games has returned 🤩
Que perfeição
i hope obscure & obscure 2,get remake
But where is "Silent Hills"" by Kojima ;-;
I only wish to get to play this in pc 😭😭💔
A história desse game é de arrepiar, gameplay fantástica, tenho orgulho de tê-lo terminado sem usar detonado, e pelo visto será fiel ao original, parabéns Konami
Resident evil rival
My prayers has been answered
Brutal como se ve mi juego favorito de mi infancia
Finally!!! lets gooo!
I hope it will have the same effect on the people who never played it, as it did on the people who played the original back in the day.
🤯🤯
nobody will talk about hideo Kojima?
I thought I lost it. Now it's back for me
never thought they would bring harrison ford in silent hill
Xbox gets Call of Duty. We get Silent Hill. It's fair I'd say.
Unreal Engine. YES SIR! 🎉
One more remake! Gerarahere!
What about SH1 (psone) remake? SH fans want it too!
Lets wait more 5 years for the PC version
LEON in Silent Hill?
Whaaaaaaaa yoooooooo finally something!!
Holy Moly
Finalmente ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Goosebumps mode activated ❤
Wow the pachinko machine franchise got so popular they made a game based off it?
This is reason alone to get a ps5
silent hill 2 is history for video games
So cool. Cant believe Konami is actually making a real videogame....
jakos dziwnie to wyglada oby polaczki tego nie zjebali bo medium bylo mocno srednie
Can't believe this is happening, I'm so happy, this game was a really special to me, I'll be there to overcome again the horror, and face the hard truth one more time.
Looks a tad like Jaime Lannister from GOT! 😲 Can't faaaarknnn wait to play this! Looks absofooknlutely nucking futs 🔥!
"You see it too? For me it's always like this"
If I had a nickel for every time a triple A company announced a remake of one of their best game sequels in their respective horror franchises THIS YEAR I will have 2 nickels which isn't a lot but it's weird it has happened twice.
Horror game of the year
Ooh maybe the fog will look higher resolution now
Taking a page out of Capcom I see?  Not that I'm complaining. At least they're something else than mobile games and pachinko machines.
Se necesita remake del Silent Hill 1, no este bodrio del 2
This looks fairly far along 😮
Very smart move on Konami's part to use this as a Ps5 exclusive - will definetely ramp up the sales for the consoles, especially considered how beloved this title is. I'm also looking forward to it, but always thought that the original's graphics and weird voice acting were what gave it that unique feel - but I suppose a remake was inevitable at this point. I think Silent Hill 1 deserves a remake even more than 2 tho :/
A masterpiece from the our childhood
I thought they forgot all about this game 😏
The original silent hill was made by a team of japanese who infused the japanese horror in a western setting. Lets just hope the western developers understand that and retain the concept. I hate seeing psychological being inclined towards action horrors nowadays.  Please please dont mess this up, i really miss this game
SH2 has one of the very best horror game stories ever
Truly based times we live in
Ağlamaq istəyirəm 😭
Já dar vontade de jogar Hahahaha 😂
Konami is BACK and I'm here for it
Is funny we skip Silent hill 1 but getting Silent hill 2 remake XD. I dun mind they remake 1 to 4 though.
In what wacky alternative reality do we live in where they would they remake SH2 over SH1. SH1 is like the most iconic horror game ever made, period. :(
Is it just me or the graphiics look like they are out of a PS4 game? I'm not amazed to say the least.
Cant wait to see new puppy ending
Wow
хуйня
nah bruh, only ps5 no pls😢
YES YES YES FINALLY!!!
Something is weird with his hands... Am I the only one???
Ok that looks fantastic!
Well...at least there is a legitimate reason now for the reuse of Pyramidhead
I guess it's time to buy a PS5 now.....
Can you fix mc face ( eyes looks so weird especially)
Whyyyy??? Why only for ps:(
Xbox fans punching the air right now 😂
P.T?
this is one more reason to get the ps5 ma bois and girls
Tidak ada untuk ps4 😩
Was this the Game they wanted to release when they brought out P.T ???
So we stop hating Konami now?
Or, how about you bring back Kojima and make Silent Hills?
Cant wait to get the ending with the dog in 4k
Well I'll be ready for this 8 hour walking simulator then.  Bloober team makes great LOOKING games,  but barely anything beyond walking sims. I hope this game changes my mind
Hemen gelsin sadece silent hill için bile PlayStation 5 alırım PlayStation 5 silim çıksa artık yani
When we understood cinema was going creatively downhill? By counting the number of remakes. Now apply this to videogames.
A franquia Silent Hill voltando com tudo, sem contar que Silent Hill 2 na minha opinião é um dos melhores.
im excited for this but would appreciate if we could get the original game on ps plus or even redone as a classic game for the premium tier.
The scariest thing in this teaser is the Konami logo.
Very cute silent hill
silent hill was a huge part of my gaming journey, great to see it back.
my favourite horror game ever
Psvr2 support
Aaaaa vai se foder Konami caralho  O 2 sério isso , poxa cadê o primeiro  Da saga seus idiotas como sempre fazendo cagada, esses executivos não sabem de porra nenhuma mesmo, ninguém liga pros fãs da saga mais, faz quantos anos que tem milhares de pessoas esperando q o Harry volte com tudo
Is that Harry Mason?
This remake will smash Resident evil
The long awaited franchise has finally arrived!
I hope the composer play the extended guitar version for Laura theme. Because its only release in the trailer.
1:41 love the moment ..
Kinda disappointing that we gotta wait a year after the Sony release before they do the PC release 😑
oooh man i feel i travelled back to 2001 and i had goosebumps.... Akira yamaoka is something else man .. he is a genius musician.
The hollywood syndrome: Let's remake everything. Fans will love it and we don't need to an original idea.
Наконец-то!!!
2:18 knowing that the Shrimp *didn't* fry that rice
walmart leon kennedy
Goofy ahh cockroach
Make the dog ending canon
We want you to remaster silent hill 1 next pleaaaase
Эмоции героя на высшем уровне
Finally, I can hear major kusanagi's singing voice once again
Bloober Team is perfect for this remake!
The ps5 exclusivity,but its also available on pc,gets me every time...Sony still trolling us...
cautiously optimistic
Minghie
YES!!   I'm a PC gamer and the last PlayStation I had was a PS2, I will go out and buy a PS5 just to play this game.
It’s about dang time!!!
Melhor trilha sonora de todos os tempos
....tears of joy. Remember that time in the hotel?
Amazing, beautiful... now fix his face.
The original was my introduction to the series. I remember playing it at my uncle's house in sections because I didn't have my own system at home. I remember being fascinated and terrified. This trailer gave me similar vibes.
Man, we who are ps1 and ps2 generation have been waiting for this announcement for a long time, Too happy!
Now we need silent Hill 1 to be remade
Leon S. Kennedy
Cant wait to see Pyramid Head banging the nurses in that small room... in HD
ЭТО ПРОСТО ОХРЕНЕННО 😱😱😱
Can't wait
99.9 percent that again it will not be true and the game will be terrible
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
It was the dog all along
I always wanted to play silent Hill since I missed my chance to play it before but why do I only see silent hill 2 what about 1? I want to play all of them
Overhyped
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
sooo is this a remake or a reinterpretation?
Vai entrar no ps plus deluxe né? Porque a Microsoft continua colocando lançamento e a Sony nada, desse jeito não dá.
Excuse me? Title is what?
Let me guess, that's Troy Baker speaking. How thrilling...
Kojima is back??
i thought i saw leon kennedy
Where is “Dino Crisis 2” ???
Le tenían miedo al éxito estos, porque un remake lo estaban pidiendo hace años....
more fog
Just game, so Divan, don't I pay $70?
Ito and Yamaoka back with the game being overseen by Team Silent to an extent brought back all those feels from when I bought this day one on PS2 after school. Tears of Joy... I see that Town.
Ah yeah, the disease called *muffled noises*
Please keep the dog ending
Konami redemption ark?????
Alright then It's time to get a PS5 just for this master piece I'm serious!!!!
Not gonna lie, I like this but I will never buy a PS5. I'm sticking with the more powerful and where all the games are console... XBOX IS KING
I have original copy of Silent Hill PS1. 😊
I never played silent hill
It looks like it was made by fans, not professionals....
Mi juego favorito por fiiiiiiin. Espero que le cambien la cara a James parece que tiene 40 años se han pasado un poco
Holy fk
Ачуметь 😮
FINALLY!!!
IT'S BACK!
This day and hour ps5 won the console battle
Never got to play this but I can't justify $670 to play it. Wonder how much Konami retconned or changed. Most of these remasters are completely despoiled.
Uncanny valley is strong with this one
🤔
I don't like this soundtrack. Give me old music.
IM SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WWWWWHATTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh great watch now they gonna push back the release date of the next set of pachinko machines because of this
This has to be 🧢
Honestly this feels like a situation where making the graphics better actually takes away from the game, as the fact that graphics were worse added to the unsettling psychological nature of the game.  The graphics just feel too clean.
THEME OF LAURA PLZ
Bloober if you * this up.....
Ayo let's gooooo!!
OH MY GOSHHHHHH
Honestly, I’m not too impressed. So, this is going to be a shot for shot remake, right down to the dialogue? The voice acting doesn’t sound too great and the graphics look just okay. I was hoping they’d find a way to breathe new life into the game besides updating the graphics. We’ll see how this turns out…
Nice birthday present  Thanks
Wo soo cool
I hate silent hill fans so much they are always complaining, if you don’t like it don’t play it simple right?
I am super happy Silent Hill 2 is getting a remaster. However why does the original Silent Hill never get any love? I would love for the original to a get a remaster. It is the game that started this great franchise.
Leon at home
마스터피스의 귀환이다
هرمنا من اجل هذه اللحظه 😭
y para pc cuando?
Is this trailer for real ?!
Look like Konami is following the Capcom’s footsteps by making a remake version of Silent Hill 2 like Capcom did made Resident Evil 2 Remake. Thanks Konami.
Theme of laura me veio a mente, nao sei porque.
"Bloober Team"  *Me:* Uh oh.
Blyat only on ps5....
Is that Leon from RE ? 🤔
never thought that day will come...
Ps4 version pleeeease
Азамат?
0:04  goosebumps ... I HATE COCROACH !!
Cant wait to play it .. i love this game so much ❤️❤️🌹🌹🔥🌹🔥🌹🔥🔥
WAAAHH
I am not your Merry
Top
Aaah this game, i used to play silent hill games with my mom
(Office Space Bill Lumbergh) yeah that would be great if we could get it on Pc
Okay Konami, do Castlevania and remake NES Metal Gear.
Man I just love Playstation 💙🤍
Without Hideo Kojima it's not a proper silent hill, I'm not feeling it
0:45 James: My face.. is this.. next-gen?
Great job guys!
See? I'm real.
AAAAA I NEED TO BUY PS5
Missing Hideo Kojima💔
Best birthday present ever 🥳
Well I wish them luck with this espically since this series is in a even worse state then Metroid was before Dread saved the franchise.
This looks like a scene for scene update, so I'm quietly optimistic. I mean, how do you recreate narrative perfection?! That's some pretty huge boots to fill.
if you live long enough you will get most things you want. here is one of them
Урааа!Я дождался! столько лет прошло! Часто вдохновляюсь Сайлент Хиллом, когда рисую Работы Ито Масахиро просто огонь! Познакомился с игрой и фильмом в 6 лет, прошел третью часть в лет 13, а потом и другие Сейчас мне уже 19 лет, я невероятно рад возрождению Сайлент Хилл❣
Truly thought i'd be an old man before this re-surfaced, glad to see I was wrong.
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
I love it
Урааа)) Хоть и типа "ремастер", но всё равно здорово. И пирамидхед вроде как каноничный. Здорово ^^
Konami returning to the consoles? Is a beautiful way to do this guys!!!
This looks really really promising I can't wait I'm so excited 😆😆😆 it's been 80 years
I don't think my little heart can stand completing this game again.  But I'll do it anyway
За Россию Z
What happened to part 1?
Все в сборе и Акира ямаоко❤️
WAIT! Konami is actually doing something right?! Color me excited but sceptical. Hopeful because it is Bloober :D
Siiiiuuuuuuu vamos
Yes! It's coming back! 😍
Fainlay... ❤️
Looks great but i think this James shows a little too much emotions compared to the original
YESSS
Оригинальный Джеймс был симпатичнее
I love how they remake the game but come on I know some of us wanted something new to the franchise
I have never played or watched any silent hill. But seeing fans excitement makes me excited to indulge into this franchise :)
Never thought I'd have to deal with Pyramid Head ever again
on the fox emgine too🤯
Somewhere in Konami headquarters:  We have sold so many pachinkos after the COVID has subsided. What do we do with money?  Remake Silent Hill?  Yes!
Finally!!😍😍😍
Yaaayyyyyyy Pyramid Head!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't get why people are excited of all these remakes...all of them are drained out of atmosphere.   Silent Hill with superb sterile graphics? It's not the point
what's wrong with his face, this is someone else... and what's with that pyram... LEATHER head ??
thank you
I love silent hill 2. But uh, how old is james again?. In Original look like he is at the end of 20s or beginning of 30s. Here he look like mid 40s.
одна из лучших серий !!!!
😍😍😍
Tanto tiempo esperando por el regreso de esta mítica franquicia que cuando vuelve no lo puedes creer.
Sony : “Please Xbox don’t buy Activision ! You’ll have too much market power ! “Meanwhile Sony puts another exclusive game in their collection 🤭
Discount Leon Kennedy
I want the remastered doggo behind the controls!
Jezuniu mój najsłodszy! Ciary gwarantowane.
Castlevania SOTN plzzzzzz
Leon ?
Can’t wait to see the Dog Ending in 4K 120FPS
🤔I know I am wrong but he looks like Leon but just older but I am glade it’s getting remastered 😎
Wait . Is this real?
i dunno bro, it looks off!
the trailer is in 60 fps but the game... just half of it
If this even comes close to the Resident Evil 2 remake, this will be one of the greatest things that happened to me in gaming.
Però appare un James più vecchio e più stanco   Questo  è ciò che lo fa sembrare più reale😊😊
Great game and amazing initiative by Konami, but shame Hideo Kojima can’t be part of it anymore 😢
After the cancelation of P.T. They gotta do Silent Hill some justice.
Looks awful, too clean, too pretty looking typical SAW looking American horror. Knew the American devs would mess it up. If you want to know what I mean go and watch the trailer for Silent Hill 4.
I’m super glad they brought back Akira!
Во! Вот это Сайлент Хилл, а не та дичь с цветочками.
I have not once ever in my life played any silent hill games now I can!
That imotions on face🫰🏻😌
Can someone tell me, why silent hill is not on ps4???
Are they also going to remake "Born from a wish"?
Leon Kennedy in silent Hill Universe... I'm all in 😂
But can I loop pyramidhead?
It looks fantastic
As soon as resident evil 2 remake came out I wondered when we would finally get the same great enemy for silent hill. Todays the day
Looks great. But they'd have a bigger hit on their hands if they just let Kojima make P.T.
Now we're talking.
Dude, DUDEEEEEE!
The best horror game of all time is BACK !
At this point SH is not even a game anymore, It's the thumbnail for my traumatic childhood aesthetic. This shocks me, thank you
It's unreal how pointless this is.
Keanu Reeves in Silent Hill
Norman reedus flees the scene.,
I don't know, konami, I've been hurt before..
I can't wait to play this and I've never played a Silent Hill game before.
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Cant wait to listen "Promise" again
How about Metal Gear?
Jerry Seinfeld: "No silent hill 1? Just silent hill 2?"
Aboooo
È stata la mia felicità enorme 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
this will be bad
I'm here for this. Should have started on numero uno tho.   Excited still.
Let's goo
Uh yes please
mmm falta mas niebla ... falta mas oscuridad... no me da ansiedad...🙃
Truly one of the games of all time.
Time to buy another ps5, with disk now and SH2 metal box!
I'll buy it! Konami, shut up and take my money!
is this for real???
LEON...!
Why not silent hill ps 1 😭
I’ve never played silent hill and i probably never will but I’m still happy Konami remembers it
My childhood nightmare 😂 I watch my older brother playing SH, can't sleep at night because of pyramid head
The sound 1:54 is the same sound used in Metal Gear 5 PP when you're costumizing your weapons and buddy equipment
Konami keep on milking franchises?
Why does pyramid head walk like a normal person? 2:42
Please release this on pc too.
compared to original his face looks kindda stupid
Now I wish I have a PS5
Ok, I might have a reason to want a PS5 now
👍👍
Metal gear solid 1-2-3 please !
Leon is working very hard in Resident Evil 4 and Silent Hill 2, he is become very old right now.
Silent Hill: childhood relived
I didn't know Leon Kennedy was in this game.
Yes!! It looks great! Thank you Konami!
This looks faithful to the original. I'm glad they didn't choose the reimagining route that Capcom did with RE2 and 3. I much prefer to play the original game that I liked than some retelling from untalented hacks like it was the case with RE2 and RE3.
Finalmente vuelve el rival de residente evil Quizás finalmente Konami volvio a como eran hace años atras.
One of my favorite games of all time. Well deserved of a remake and it's great to see the composer of the classics back. Can't believe I'm saying this but thanks Konami
I'd rather the Kojima version they disrespectfully and ungratefully canceled but thisll do just fine indeed
IM SO HAPPY I LOVE IT
The waiting its over... I'm waiting since Downpour
Can not wait
I am so glad they giving us the horror game that we loved and enjoy. Thank you so much and can't wait to buy it!!!
i wish they'll also make a pc version of this. the last pc SH2 screen ratio bugs-out on modern hardware.
Awesome! Can't wait!
Are they gonna add pachinko machines in the game?
I don't want to see cockroaches in high definition
Ps4 pls
So the same game again?
He might have depression.
Shame i got no ps5... Yet.
I'm about to cry bro this game was the best I can't wait
- director, we don’t have any ideas for new games - remaaaaake time 🙄
It only took them a decade to re-re-master SH2. My only question is, will the fog be in the day 1 patch, or paid DLC?
Excited. Hopefully they don't make it too "cool". It seems that it keeps the sad ambient but this game is also very "disgusting" in a way and it's one of the things that makes it so special in my opinion
Finally a reason to buy a ps5!
fcng PS.... PC forever!!!  Make better graphics and run it for PC platform. Wata fc. sony suxx. xbox suxx.. PC PC PC PC PC PC PC!!!  please PC. i want replay sh2 in actual graphics.
Just gonna leave this here. I was here. I was pumped, excited and thrilled with this announcement.
Was excited till I looked it up and found out it's ps exclusive for a whole year again......plz stop with this bs sony.
WHAAAAAAAAATTTTTT YEEEEEEEEEASSSS
is no one gonna talk about how sh 1 remake is just not happening
on unreal and bloob team... even at the stage of teaser doesn't look promising
چه عجب کونامی
😍😍😍😍😍🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
Woah Hype!
Looks great, how will they ruin it?
So this was the reason Konami's been "Silent"?
This is why I don’t like Playstation to be crying and whinnying about Activision blizzard!
Yes 🙌🏻 🙂
leon with his new objective
Decent
finally
If this is well received I pray they remake the original Metal Gear games
I hope i will see loot boxes in it. Wanna wear pink coat
I'M CRYING GUYS
KONAMI FINALLY DOING THINGS AGAIN!!!!!
We are going home boys and gals....see you in the fog👣🪓
How come we don’t have silent hill 1 ? I don’t remember there being a silent hill 1 remake ?
Masterpiece ❤
Castlevania sotn, Konami?
Too bad this isn't playable for me for another 12 months after launch seeing as the console went up in price and are still harder to find than hens teeth
Mu...der...er...
Oh hey look. Another Remake... yay 😮‍💨 what about some NEW games??
great :D
Still no pt
Whoosh, dem visuals!
Played all resident evil and silent hill games including remakes, can't wait to add this one to my collection.  P.s. never noticed that James is rocking the Leon Kennedy hairstyle
Timed exclusive is so so stupid.
Haha my ex friend a big sh nut goes anger mode over this thinks it’s trash but me I’m like in love 🥰
Orca troia
Fans for so the last 9 years: Konami giff us Silent Hill you!!!  Konami : here's your Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill F, Silent Hill Townfall and Silent Hill Ascension
Lol is this real🤯🤯🤯
Hopefully they added theme of laura as the opening 🥹
Watched my older brother plat these games as a kid. Time to start my own journey with this one.
i'am ready
show us gameplay !
I had to see it to believe it...
Ive never played silent hill in my life, but Ive had a very vivid dream in this exact world. The buildings, the fog, the monsters. Maybe it was a prophetic.
in my restless dreams, i see that town, silent hill... because they removed the fog in the remaster
just wow
Is this a remake or reboot?
Lad looks like if Leon from RE was a junkie
Wow that looks great. Love it :)
This is nice and all, but the original was already a masterpiece.  Can't Konami just move forward with the series instead of making remakes of masterpieces?  I am part of the generation that thrives on nostalgia but come on!
It looks so bad and nothing new in the trailer. Just nurse and pyramid head all over again. What a waste.
now konami make castlevania SOTN remake please..
I’m hyped like extremely hyped but I still hate Konami
I can't wait for gameplay !
I hope they remake silent hill 1 too
НИХУЯ СЕБЕ
REMAKE SH 1 DAMMMIITTTTTT!!!!!!
Зашибись! Ничего, подождём версию для Xbox. Теперь мы квиты, учитывая, что в The Medium мы играли раньше владельцев PS5. Судя по ролику сделали всё как надо! Слюнки уже текут.
Dayum, they gave my boi James 15 years, he ain't looking 29 anymore
"Exclusive"  I guess we will have to wait a little longer 😞.
"Look how they massacred my boy". The worst case Bloober scenario is happening. It's so sad that game that made you a gamedeveloper will have a remake with fanfic/cartoon vibe.
This is insane
@Twin Perfect
no doubt this is made in unreal engine
Toluca Lake, here we go again
Welcome home
Tood bad it's not the guy from death stranding
Why he is looks like Leon Kennedy, but not like James Sunderland?
Perhaps, Jim Ryan after personally flying to Brussels to express EU concerns about the Xbox deal with ActiBlizz, also personally flew to Konami office to buy the Silent Hill 2 exclusivity for his console. Yes, Jim? After all, this is completely different.
Леон?
This looks so underwhelming.
They were using fog to deal with graphical limitations back then. Now the graphics has improved, I hope it will be much scarier
👍🥳🥳🥳
Not a pachinko? , is it the end of the world?
Now THAT get's me excited
I love how the guy looks like a combination between Mads Mikkelsen and Leon from Resident Evil
Falta el remake de Dino crisis y no le pido nada más a la vida.
what about sh1
"In my restless dreams, I see that town. Silent Hill. You promised me you'd take me there again someday. But you never did." And Akira Yamaoka is back for the sound design. This is gonna be amazing, finally.
As a huge fan, I feel truly disappointed.The mirror scene just shattered in front of my eyes... But as always, i guess it's just me and everybody seems so happy about this.
HEY！SH1 REMAKE！ NOT ２！
I literally don't think I've ever been this excited for anything ever. Please don't mess this up.   "James honey, did something happen to you? After we got separated in that long hallway? Are you confusing me with someone else? You were always so forgetful, remember that time in the hotel? You said you took everything...but, you forgot that video tape we made. I wonder if its still there?"
nhu cc
Tranquilo no llores, todo va ha estar bien
You're going to resident evil it I'm actually excited
i was a young kid when i played Silent Hill 2 on ps1.... I remember the scene with James getting in to the bathroom and watching himself in the mirror and i was like ,,,, WOW ,,,,  the graphics !!!! are they going to be like this in the future ??? why not now !!!  and fast forward to 2023 who wouldv thought  we'd  see most of the games lookin like this
what piano tune is that?
Exclusive????
🦮Ending in 4k an better Graphics ❤
Wow, when don't have yet ps5, but you always update with ps5 game😳😳😌
Finally P.T 2 😆
sin Kojima, sin Guillermo del Toro, bueno igual
Thank you @Playstation and @konami ❤️
Please remake SH1 too
Bro let us get parasite eve remaster also
Konami please please don’t cancel this and don’t ruined it. Give us what we wanted
Yes😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Shame sony  removed the excitment from  another game.
Wait is this really happening my favorite game silent hill 2 remastered on ps5
Awesome ❤
James kinda looks like an aged Leon. Glad silent hill is back!
УИИИИИИИИ
Боже, я щас заплачу.
I'm 20 years now and I never played original game but listened to soundtrack so much, such a beautiful music  I'm feeling like it'll be nostalgic somehow to play this remake
Leon old version
Meh not impressed
Finally , A new fcking Horror game
Pretty worried that Bloober Team's the ones handling the remake, release of an announcement trailer is kinda scuffed too. Still pretty exciting all things considered.
Wishlist now? I'm still wishing for a PS5!
Hopefully the developers interpreted this game as vague as it should be
Yesss
the time has come to revisit SilentHill  👏🥲💘
Hope they nail it the way capcom did with RE2 remake
This looks gorgeous!!!
Hey playstation if all you're going to do is remakes let's do tenchu
It doesn’t look terrible, but I feel like James is almost too expressive. Atleast in this trailer his face is constantly contorted and overtly sad looking. Makes me think many of the scenes will be overly sensationalized.   James in the ps2 version was always kind of apathetic to the things happening, giving him the vibe of somebody in over their head, while still making him look plenty sad and remorseful. This might be nitpicking, but I am curious to see where they take this remake.   Hoping for the best. Preparing for the worst.
No chromatic aberration. That's a bad sign. it hits different without Hideo Kojima
I was interested, until I saw “developed by Bloober team”
Akira Yamaoka + Masahiro Ito + Blooper Team = can't wait to play Silent Hill 2 (but take your time to do it 😉)
“In sickness... And in Health...” Silent Hill the greatest horror masterpiece 🌫️🌁
Please all parts of silent hill games remake
Finally
Can’t wait for dashie to play this ong
About time👍
Finally, someone big budget releases a trailer with no release date that they may end up delaying, bravo and well done Konami.
I really like this trailer. old Silent Hiil 2 and New Silent Hill 2 remake ❤️❤️
Konami is outsourcing game development to Poland, strange times we live in
My all time favourite game is finally getting a remake, I have dreamt of this day
WOW
This is beautiful.
Best Silent Hill Game ever! Can’t wait 😍
I already hate the new voice actors
Is this real?
Hope we will get a PS4 piece
Continuing the silent Hill ps2? 0.0
WHY BLOOBER TEAM? WHY NOT KONAMI?
Konami finally remembered they password
I never thought Greednami would even think of releasing this game, did theybhave a change of heart?
Ха, мы серьёзно ждали новую часть? Ладно... История Сандерленда для меня любимейшая из всех в Silent Hill, даже жаль, что развязку знаю. Надеюсь, по принципу Resident Evil сделают - с пасхалками, но альтернативным прохождением. Выкатите, чёрт побери, уже фильм по 2й части! Идеальный же сюжет для драматического триллера!
I love this and I want it to succeed but the main reason for that is if this sells well maybe we could get a silent hill 1 remake.
I'm really confused. This doesn't look like pachinko.
And Sony are crying to the regulators about Microsoft acquiring Activision.. the hypocrisy!
One of my favorite games of all time. This trailer has been on repeat all day. Yamaoka and Ito returning is incredible news. I'm so happy.
Is this the same game that has the AI that learns how you play and tries to go against your way of playing
I'm hyped for a remix of the dog ending song!
Im wondering is this going to work without hideo kojima now that he's out of konami?
James Sunderland looks like Adrian Brody
I'm fine with waiting a year to get it on my Series X. It's gonna look great either way. Who else is hyped, just at the simple fact that James is BACK?!?!?!
This is one of the best PS exclusive trailers i have ever seen. The acting ,the design ,the graphics and the overall vibe is just jaw-dropping
drodzy Blooberzy nie spierdolcie tego / don't fck this up please!
cant wait to see another doge ending
Can’t wait to play this
Wouldv'e prefered P.T.
Can’t wait🎉
the nightmare continues.
Finally... About abouy time. ✉
nah ill watch it. i give up on them. i woulda bought it a few years ago.  im sure its gonna be a cool walkthrough
Now it's time for a new Castlevania. Please I'm begging you.
Finally, a remake of the franchise.
Ps4 is better als ps5
Konami redemption arc?
Yeeesssss🎉❤👊👊👊
Looks like Leon from resident evil!
P.T. a Hideo Kojima Game
❤️🤍💛💙💜💚
I am still baffled that this is not a pachinko remake :V
I have a feeling this has caused a loud noise.
الابدااااع 😍😍😍❤🌹
The last Silent Hill product by Konami was a pachinko machine and Blooper Team are famous for making walking simultators.  I'm worried
SILENT HILL FANS UNITE!!!
👍👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
can't wait for mark and bezos explaining this after 10 years...
Σ Ι Λ Ε Ν Τ  Χ Ι Λ Λ ς
Well... it doesn't have atmosphere of original at all. Silent hill 2 is like a terrible, twisted, heavy nightmire, that will end only with the last breath. Here, it's more like ordinary action. The world is so clean and shiny, that it does not at all look like a city abandoned after a fire.
James Sunderland! This name will always exist in my head
Another unoriginal lazy remake. And the average gamer will just eat it up
Wait...is Konami back?
💥💪😁 Best game, best music. I am waiting.  I'll play AGAIN 😛🇵🇱👍
@PlayStation  Polish dubbing will be available? ? ?
3:06 the best part of the video hahaha 🤣
Pretty generic. Bad trailer. Boring.
I'm impressed by the details, the pressure when he pressed his hand with his thumb was awesome
I was saving for a car. I am now saving for a PS5.
pyramidhead has wrong pyramid
What an l they couldnt be creative and make a new one
Uhhhhhhhhhh love
i love you all who played Silent hill in 1999  at age 9-10 with parents ❤️❤️❤️
Will it be available for PS4? Please say yes.
Waiting for
gonna pull a pt on this one
take my money now!
Waiting for this game to release..☺️
Leon S. Kennedy in an alternate reality.
The Nurse 😘
Silent Hill is thé Best atmospheric DISTURBING game from the very beginning.
Finally, but such a pity it's not Kojima.
bring me SH 1 remake
Man finally silent hill is back! Now please remake number 1 and 3 We need more ❤️😁
Time for the Fortnite skins
Finally !!!!
@hugodelire on veut le gameplayyyyyy
If the dog ending is not here... I dont want it
Leon is that you?
Wait....exclusively PS?🤔
Sanji?
fake
50000 rupees item is sold for 75000 rupees why don't you stop black marketing your games are very expensive is it possible for any student buy
We getting the Dog ending?
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas
Yaaaaaaaas
Yes
We've been waiting for so long 🤩
Its hard to i cry... But u guys made me cry :')
Directamente van a hacer un remake del 2 pero no del 1? O harán remake del 1 en un futuro?
Lol 😂 dis i seeing him as Leon and the woman Mary looks like Claire is dis resident Evil 2 Remake 😂
AYO?
I would love to see a new silent hill movie.
Por fin un Silent Hill. El problema para mí es que yo tengo Xbox está generación, bueno espero que lo disfruten en la Play Station 5 y lo compren para que konami apueste por la saga vamos a darle amor 😚. Yo espero tener una PS5 Slim si es que la sacan, no me gusta la actual consola prefiero esperar un poco para que el  catálogo este llego de juegos que se diferencien de Xbox. Quien pueda lo animo a que tenga las dos no se arrepentirán, ambas compañías están trayendo juegos de muy buena calidad. Silent Hill merece que se le apoye ya que en la época de PS2 y PS1 mucha gente lo jugo pirata, y esas copias no contaron, una lastima.
Bloober team is not known for great game design or asian approach to horror and it shows in this trailer. Sure, it's visually stunning, so is The Medium (which is OKAY, but nowhere near SH2 in any aspect). I'm expecting something along the lines of James Wan films. It won't be terrible, just nothing close to the original experience. New soundtrack by Yamaoka is not filling me with glee either somehow. So yeah, zoomers won't be experiencing silent hill 2 after all, just bloober team's vision of it (which is very distorted).
After Alan wake,another twin peaks influenced game got remastered
This feeling i have right now is unexplainable, the feels, the chills, the nostalgia the memories... The tears of joy at the announcement of this title are just unexplainable. The reboot of Silent Hill is like the most awaited things of all time. Like I'm not just crying, I'm shaking, jumping, the excitement. ❤️ SH2. It's time to start the journey from new perspective James...
Pyramid head, yaaay
Pyramid head’s arms are looking kinda 👀👀
So no Metal Gear ? Ight, imma head out
Exklusive?
Only legends watching this trailer.
Don't... Don't give us hope.
wow
RE6?
At least its on pc at launch, I'll never go back to ps5 🤢
Don't you dare leave the dog ending out!
Let there be a dual related of silent hill 2 and F
❤❤❤❤
"I'm not your Mary"..
this is a dream ?!
Sick! a dream is coming true!
I will not be hyped so easily, Konami
DUUUUDE. CANNOT WAIT
Leon, is that you?
After so many SH gamer have left  this world now they will watch this sequel from the otherside.
No Ps4?
There's so much hope. Now just please... Don't drop the ball. Please make this remake legendary...  Please Konami.
The Silent Hill returns ...
If this turns out as great as it looks. Konami is at least on its way to redemption.
30 or 60fps ?
P.T = PACHINKO TIME!!!!
Ahh yes man made horrors beyond my comprehension 2.
Why no silent hill 1 though?
is it real or am i dreaming?
will fail to live up to the original
Заливают о важности того что бы майки не купили активижн, иначе сделают калду эксклюзивной, и прочее нытьё, и сами при этом продолжают выбивать эксклюзивность игр от внешних издателей и разработчиков. Аплодирую стоя. Или у сони как у либерастов со свободой слова, экслюивность это хорошо только когда это эксклюзивнлсть для сони?🤣
After years… proud of polish studio! Waiting! Let’s make a true magnificence for the years! ❤️
please don't change "theme of laura" and "promise" OST..
finally, konami is doing something
ok Silent Hill 3 next
i see, konami need more fuel for them pachinko machine
This would be a competition between Silent Hill 2 and Resident Evil 4 remake, those 2 are the greatest horror games in PS2 era
whattt
ITS HAPPENING
They'll never make up for cancelling P.T., but better than nothing
This game came out the year before I was born so I never got a chance to play it, but once I get a PS5 I'm going to definitely buy it
James looks strange 🤣
Amazing it coming back but why start at 2 the original was amazing too for it’s time.
This is so look amazing today games look so realistic other than 500 crore rupees waste on adipurush 😉
PT is still the scariest game I've ever played
omfg don't tell me they're going to be exclusives from Shitstation 5
This game will be butchered
I will never forgive Konami
One of the greatest games of all time and Konami gave it to Bloober Team 😂 Please don't mess this up, I beg
Every MasterPiece made in UE5 will be LEGENDARY.
WHAT?!
THE reason to get a PS5. I got you Zach. Trust and believe.
awesome 👍
Cone Head slap me
This looks great but I’m disappointed because I want a remake SHL1  because it was a masterpiece not this one.
Wait....this isnt a pachinko slot machine????
Whot about silent hill 1? :(
Finally Konami....
Yooo man I miss PT so much, haven't played the original but looking forward to it
Ну такое
looks like insane
Is this Leon S. Kennedy? 😅
1:42 he could've put his arm through another bar and took the key with ease xD.
Stupid, STUPID REMAKED.  Shattered Memories IS NOT REMAKED.  WE NEED SILENT HILL 1 TRURT REMAKED.  I NOT SOLD THIS REMAKED............. NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I look forward to playing this but it would have made more sense to do the games in order. The main character James looks like a mix between Leon S.Kennedy and James Gordon from Gotham the TV show.
I always wanted to play this game, now there are no excuses 😁✌
oh no
I don't remember Pyramid Head looking like that.
I never actually played the original, so I'm super exited to play this.
Мать, накрывай на стол! Тут такое !!!😃😍
10/10
At last...
Make Days gone 2 pls 😔❤️
NO WAY MY CHILDHOOD IS COMING BACK!!!!
Let's see the Blooberisms! I honestly don't believe they will put anything of value or new ideas in this so...why don't just remaster the tetralogy and release them instead of this?
Mary na końcowej grafice wygląda jak Julia Wieniawa... mimo to zwiastun super i nie mogę się doczekać!
ok
I think konami only make pachinkos
Weird coincidence. I finally decided to play Silent Hill 1-3 this month because October and because they are among the few survival horror games I haven't played. I'll be honest though, I'm not really impressed by the series so far. I'm half way into 3. I thought 2 was kind of dull. It was entirely focused on characters and it was more depressing than it was a horror game. I honestly feel like that game was trapped in the survival horror formula and probably would have worked better as a modern walking simulator.
L STUDIO
Why does he look like the newest leon from the RE games?
Wow, finally not a pachinko machine.
Kept you waiting huh
Thank you Konami for making Akira Yamoaka's return possible. His music is so unique, it would have been impossible to capture the spirit of the original without him. That's a real horror game! We're in a nostalgic mood😊
Now I finally have a reason to want a Ps5, lol.
Ok, now Playstation 5 have a reason to exist for me!
what
so…where’s Komjima
Wow
Remember how James looked like David Beckham in the original game?
This is the kind of games that deserves a remake , Ps1 and Ps2 games and maybe a ps3 game but now a days even a Ps5 game get a remake for the Ps5 again
Actually hope this game fails hard. Playstation gating games for exclusivity when they whine about the Activision acquisition and how xbox could possibly gate cod way later down the line.
Can't wait to play this on SteamOS or Windows!  Can we stop pretending that this model holds up?  OMW back to play GoW on something that isn't my PS4 (where I already have a license for it).
I'm happy to see so many people excited but I feel like i'm the only one who thinks the original is perfect and doesn't need remaking?
I Love the mist from Silent Hill ❤
Wow !!
sabah sabah şok oldum şok sonunda !! oynamak için sabırsızlanıyorum 😅
What an overacting! Does Nicolas Cage play protagonist?
omgomgomgomgomgomg
The question is when?
Silent hill 😃😩
What's the matter James.. Don't you recognise me?
Que poca madre por qué tuvieron que esperar hasta play station 5
This is epic🙂Thank you Konami and everyone for doing this
Im super excited for all these new releases. I just hope after the success of SH2 they remake SH1 & SH3 kinda like what they did for Resident Evil
pyramid head is finally back in his original form 😮‍💨
Can we also get the disjointed stunted dialogue/voice acting to return as well, thanks.
no Silent Hill 1?!
Konami's redemption arc?
I want a new half life saga
Imagine an OPen world horror game
Masterpiece🔥
Unrealistic, cockroaches only move whe youre not looking at them.
I already know they are going to blow it
why leon look soooo olddd 😅
Wow, this looks really bad. Rough years for gaming.
Let's hope Bloober don't mess it up. I also didn't really like the character design of James, I guess I expected him to look different.
Wow
Yoooooooooooooooooooooooo
Nice the same team that made the Medium
James is looking a little like Crispin Glover with a bad dye job.
Come on Konami, now its time for Metal Gear remakes also.
so happy silent hill is back!
Amazing. Can't wait to play!!!
I still can't believe that this is actually happening. I'm so happy, I never thought we'd ever get another Silent Hill finally, let alone 4!!!
!!!!!
In Jim Ryan we trust. PlayStation! ☝🏻
This has redeemed Konami. This was one of the best trailers of 2022, and I’m confident this isn’t going to be ruined by wokeness.
But I want it now
It's insane that most of us still can't get a ps5, hopefully by the time this game comes out we will all be able to get our hands on a console
It looks way too clean when compared to the original game. Gotta work on that.
Не нужен ей ремейк. Почему не SH1?
Porfin, un silent hill :D
Vaya decepción no lo hicieron esclusivo de las pachinko
⚽
Excited for remakes......man I miss being young when we got actual new games
I’m skeptical. We all remember what happened last time Remakes were made.
🖐️😲💥
I thought they would not do that. Pray for the same quality as RE2!
Pues no que las exclusivas eran malas Play Station? Tanto llorar por Activition, tanto pleito con Xbox.
Silent Hill  2 remake??? wooow !
JAMES SUNDERLAND HAS RETURNED!! OH HOW IVE MISSED YOU!!!
Too bad it's only on ps
Is this for ps5 only?
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
COE KONAMI, ESTOU EM PRANTOS AQUI :')
Dino Crisis remake next, I beg you 🥺
Yes, one of my absolute favorite games in one of my absolute favorite series 💕 I hope they do it justice!
헤으응 간호사 눈나
IM ACTUALLY SPEECHLESS RN
Как обидно, что ремейк самой бессмысленной и неудачной части серии ((((((
This game was quite scary bakc in the day. Now with this graphical update it's atmosphere explodes! This really is scary again! Can't wait. Now I have a reason to retire my PS4 and get new one. Just saw the asterix in the end, also available on PC - wow... okay, still might get it on the PS5 so my girl and I can get scared together on the couch. :D
Я уж думал это один из псевдотрейлеров, настолько не верилось
33 I am, silent hill I've been waiting to revisit you
I will buy
WHAT??????????? WHAT DID I MISS I JUST WOKE UP
y tho
Guess who's buying a PS5 just to play this awesome game 😁
I'm not paying eight-hundred dollars or more for a console to play a game that's twenty years old. I'm glad there are actually new Silent Hill games being made or this stream would have been entirely worthless.
Наконец то! Пс стор включите в РФ! Нужно предзаказывать )
Yoo!!!
YESSS!
I can’t be the only one disappointed in this? Silent hill 2 really? As if they scrapped Hills in favour of this, give my guy Norman reedus and P.T. The justice they deserve ffs.
This looks incredible! Visually it looks promising, but I'm worried/curious  about gameplay. It was the shoddy combat and stiff controls ( I think it was tank, but cant remember as I haven't played in a while ) that added to the feeling of helplessness. Silent hill characters are everyday guys, no military training or tough guy back ground etc. I'm curious how this translates with the smoothness of modern gaming.
I'm not sure about this one, something seems off
PS5 exclusive is a big L
We need ps4 version
I can't wait for the dog ending in HD...
idk man looks just as I remember it
Doubt this'll ever happen but I hope this can come to PS4 Thought other things say it'll be an exclusive so I dunno
Guest Starring Murphy Pendleton
Vuelvo a mis origenes ,para revivir esta joya en una nueva generación, no puedo esperar para volver a jugarlo 😎
Q mierda le hicieron al jamess
is this running on unreal engine 5????
Why 2 not 1
Finally a modern Silent Hill game where the pyramid head actually make sense.. lol  Also, i want to add that i hope Konami knows what they are about to do, because if they ruin this remake they can shut their doors as fans will be furious. Im really positive about it however, as i see more and more amazing japanese titles get either an amazing new game or remake (FF7, RE2-3, DMC5), so i hope thats exactly whats next with SH and Konami. I hope they finally found their mojo too.
It's back, guys.
I can't tell if those are the original VA's. I do hope so because we don't want a Hijinx repeat with replacing them.
Is that Taco 🌮 head the enemy?
I get Silent Hill and all, but I dont want Metal Gear to come back, if there is no Kojima
Мы дождались
With the amount of video essays coming out talking about this title year after year on YT it's only natural for them to make a remake. The question is can the guys from Krakow, Poland make it justice? There's something about the original Japanese SH team that is very special in delivering the atmosphere in their titles. It's this uncanniness that western devs can't seem to grasp based on the previous titles developed in the west. I very much hope it's different in this case but I temper my expectations nonetheless. It's this cleanness, emphasis on the iconic visuals that make me have my doubts. I have a feeling that it's the SH2 people know from the internet instead the one they have played themselves in the past. Despite that wishing the best and kudos to the team for making their dream game :>
Graphic looks worst
Nice try Konami, you won't get me this time
Don't forget what they did to P.t
Aller on continu les remakes sur cette génération de merde. Hop hop 80 euros.
Let’s gooo!!!
patented bloober team
Esperemos dure mucho más que el original. SH ❤️🎮
Al fin después de tanto esperar se nos está dando está obra de arte 😭🖤✨
Hiii olha o pai do Leon Kenedy
This guy looks like leon In his late 40's or early 50's
Does anyone think the cockroach in the beginning of the teaser is a shout to Silent Hills PT? Cuz that also started with cockroaches zoomed in like that.   Can't wait for this game!
It's very well done.👍
The original will always be the best game for me, but have great hopes for this too, after 21 years. 💙
How is this real
Please remake silent hill 1
hopefully this will come to pc
Awesome, don't stop Sony, make Silent Hill great again
So is there a reason I can’t play this on PC or Xbox? Why is Sony complaining about console exclusives again?
Внешность главного героя напоминает уставшего леона кеннеди)
is sony taking care of this project on a certain level? if that's how it is, i can rest somewhat asure it's going to turn okay at the end. bloober studio is a risky choice and i was baffled when the rumor started, but with sony oversseing and having a personal stake now makes me believe all this will not be a complete disaster
I’m not convinced until I see the actual game
wheres guy cihi
0:49 James sounds like Matthew McConaughey lol
I'm happy with this, now I only need parasite Eve and Dino crisis remakes 😅👍
time to loop the executioner
Absolutely NOTHING could have me more in anticipation than this. This is such a dream come true! 🥹
I would have expected better graphics on the PS5. This looks early PS4.
NOOOOOICE!!!!
1:30 😏
In my restless dreams,i see that face...hobo with a shotgun
Having to remake the old one because without Kojima they won't be able to make a new one lol.
1:51 this sound plays everytime you go to the sortie prep screen in MGS:V.     Kojima confirmed to return?  if no then, request for money: DENIED.
His face looks like the sad face snapchat filter i dont know why
Sborro
Wow! That looks amazing! Not sure I'm 100% happy with the way James looks here. I honestly always thought of him as a younger character, but it still looks great! I love how clear everything is!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Wow. I've... Probably never played this and yet I know what this is. And it looks FIRE👏
Can't wait to see doge ending in 4k 60fps
Надеюсь Konami не просрёт этот шанс как всегда.
it just doesn't seem right to enjoy this
yeah...we´ll see when it comes out..
Ya se diviertieron los pequeños con Resident evil , ahora nos toca a los Alfas.💪
They better keep the dog ending. 🐶
Stunning.
Say what you want about PlayStation, but they give you be what you want and then some
El mejor SH de la saga tendrá un remake, se ve épico.
So Konami is basically going Capcom mode.
nathan drake ?
So many whining babies in the comments section, we get it, your not buying the remake.
Wow that looks really nice also I live this type of graphics
The visuals are cool, but the fact that it’s developed by a Polish independent gaming studio and not team silent makes me think they’re going to miss the mark in that “ this is weird because it’s Japanese” sort of way
James looks like a vegan 👀
Hope that Shattered Memories will be next for a revival 🥰
is it just me that think the pyramid head now look smaller than previous game ?
pyramid head
Silent Hill 2 - Best horror ever
Wow I didn’t expect to see this….
I wonder; if you play to achieve the Maria ending, whether the 2 pyramid head scene will play out this time. I always felt that the Maria ending, implies that James didn’t really learn or face up to what he did. As a result, the 2 pyramid head scene becomes redundant, in the grand scheme of things.
Remake or remaster always ... easy money
Looks awesome but after the Konami PT incident i cant buy this and support Konami
Amazing game
I like what I see but I do with the could have got the original voice actors back
If this remake dosent include the dog ending it’s a garbage game
Just as I was playing silent hill 2 on a ps2 emulator on my phone, there's this.... And I might not even be able to play it if it's ps only...😐
This truely is, a silent hill.
in my my restless dreams,  I see that console playstation 5 you promised me you'd become available some day But you never did
I’m not feelin it at all 😒 hope you all enjoy though
Isn't silent hill 1 remake the more obvious option?
ずっとやってみたかったゲームだ！
They really brought silent hill back!!! YES!
Leon, get out of there; that’s not your family!
I thought Konami just wanted to make pinball machines or something and didn't care about making great games.
They can change a lot about the game and it will still be fine. One thing they should never dare to touch is the soundtrack. The silent hill 2 soundtrack is perfect.
why does he look British
The only me is me. Are you sure the only you is you?
No way!
What track is it from 2:30 to 2:37?
This looks like a really nice pachinko machine.
My brutal honest opinion, SH 2 was very special, for some of us it was beyond description. A remake can never capture that, but I like to think of this as an homage. We will be sacrificing the surreal, eerie, Twin Peaks, dream like feel for a more stark, richly dark, more literal horror experience. They will be two very different experiences. As someone who has loved SH2 and SH before that, Im proud that the fans continued love for the series has pushed Konami to FINALLY give SH another kick at the can. Looking forward to this, but Im moreso looking forward to what they do with original SH content
Al fin, al fin, al fin, ¡al fin! 😭😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
We're going to see Maria again 💋💋
Can't wait it been to long
he doesnt look like james sunderland
Pt PTSD
so it's a full-on Remake a là Resident Evil 2 ???
Please have a "here be monsters" audio tape somewhere
I mean, at least james' voice sounds marginally better than the remaster performance.
I'm going to cry all over again. The visuals are insane!
Wow 😯 finally
We are getting Resident Evil 4, Alone in the Dark remakes and now Silent Hill 2!  This is awesome!
Tbh I've got mixed opinions on this. On one hand (and by far my stronger leaning) I am so incredibly stoked for this game. Even though its not in the best of hands with bloober, I believe they can make it work. However, the trailer really fails to impress me. Silent Hill has always been ahead of the curve, especially when it comes to graphics. We haven't seen much of the gameplay/in-engine lighting as of yet so it's difficult to speak on that, but the art style concerns me. It's painfully mediocre, to the point where it looks almost *cartoonish,* which is decidedly wrong for the tone of silent hill. Who knows, this may be an incredibly primitive model of the game that will be vastly improved upon, but if bloober's other ventures are anything to go by, we may end up with a game sporting sub-par graphics. I guess we'll have to trust Ito to make the art direction work. Overall excited 👍
Never buying a Konami game after what they did to Hideo Kojima
it looks a bit rough around the edges but I'm still excited for this!
I'm crying
Chupa Corinthians
What in the world Leon Kennedy doing in Silent Hill?
Never heard of Konami. It looks like a Pachinko company? That makes me excited!
I'm not really hot on the idea of remaster but I'll take whatever Konami gives me
This guy looking like Leon from Re4 but a bit older.
Why 2? Where's 1?
I'm sobbing... so happy
"2" So, without watching the trailer this is either a sequel to the unmade game or a remake of the original Silent Hill 2. If so, where is the SH1 remake? If it's a sequel...How do you make a sequel to a game that technically never existed?
So friggin excited!!
James looks a bit like Ed Norton from certain angles
На роль Мері взяли польку з нерівним носом =(
Ok. Will wait when release on pc
O icone do terror esta de volta. Konami, atualiza apenas as mecanicas da jogabilidade, só isso. Mantenha a historia intacta que o sucesso é garantido !!!!!
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSS YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES FINALLYY!!!!!!!!!!
i need promotion🙄🙄🙄🙄
Finding Mary! 😭
I'm waiting...
Que descarados!! utilizan el motor grafico que pertenece a PC "Unreal Engine" para crear el juego ¿pero lo hacen exclusivo para PS5? es como si pidieran prestada mi casa para una fiesta y luego digan que no puedo entrar porque no estoy invitado.😠
Car@lho tô arrepiado nessa porr@ aqui
I can dig it👍👍👍
I'm speechless
You mean James isn't going to be changed to a gender non-binary black birthing person? Count me out..
Its like they cant decided whether they wanted this guy to be Caucasian or japanese
I’m gonna go back and replay the original on ps2 just to prepare for this remake. This is gonna be spectacular!
Yessss’!!!!!! Finally!!!!!!!
You'll have to go through your own personal silent hill to get a PS5
Это просто охуенно
Please make it as a hybrid for PS VR2, too!
Finally 😍😍😍
Konami thank you so much for a remake of the prefect jem that was silent hill 2
Whats the difference between this and what p.t. Would have been?
Lets see how many people are still like F Konami after this
YOOOOOOOOO
Графон ps4🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Ladies and Gents, we finally got it
why isn’t this getting released on xbox???? on this inferior machine? lol. wasted opportunity
Kinda weird to see a middle aged white guy as the protagonist
I am happy to see David Lynch star in Silent Hill 2 Remake!😎💖
Leon Kennedy?
I’m just happy this isn’t a pachinko machine or a free-to-play mobile game.
Pyramid head viene mas picudo que nunca
I though konami was all about pachinko and slot machine now
Oh hey, that's cool indeed.
As a SH fan, I'd never understand the hype over this. Looks like another cash grab for the nostalfags. RE3 remake came to my mind.
Oh boy i hope konami addicted with remake this franchise...i waiting silent hill the room remake😂
Pt’s back!
Наконец-то это свершилось!
To see the satanic logo up right..
F*cking finally!!!!!!!
I’d like the original more, Unless they pull a re1 remake and make it the exact same gameplay style
Turkish representation 2 seconds in
James looks like sad version of leon
My Body is ready
But.. P.T.??
I hope this wouldn't suffer the same fate as P.T.
This better have the dog ending.
I don’t know why, but now I smell Castlevania: SOTN Remake is in the making.
Awesome Silent Hill 2 Teaser Trailer.
It would be nice if studios would release some new games.
Xbox Game Pass 😏🥳🤌🤘
Without a doubt one of the scariest and most heartbreaking games to ever exist
finallyy
Hey guys is leon?
Konami, please remember MGS4 Gun of The Patriots too. I wanna play that on PC.
Excited but now he looks like Leon lol but he's always had they haircut even I  the original
Shout out to all those who stuck around to witness the masterpiece return! What a great time to be a Silent Hill fan 🎉
I'm down
Салам Русским, буду первым. Че пацаны это игра экз PS5? Или Сони опять сольют ее на пк?
At last I hope we can get a clean version of Theme of Laura extended guitar solo.
they really are gonna make me buy a ps5 now huh
How much better would this be if it had next gen sony handheld suport
Boycott this game since it’s going to PlayStation only, you know the company that is crying that it’s not fair that Call of Duty might be on Xbox only.
we need Metal Gear  solid not this boring game
Thank you!! But... and PS4? 😔
yes yes yes yes ❤❤❤❤❤ silent hill is back with bloober team is dirty move but this the day i hope after the success of silent hill 2 konami will make new part of silent hill ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ i'm shocked and excited  woooooooooooooooooooooho
hype!!!
“I really don't care”
Please upgrade the graphics and gameplay.
Leon é você?
The horror... the horror! This trailer already overwhelmed me with emotion. Glad to see this game will be available to more people than ever, in higher fidelity than ever.
silent hill where have you been  It took too long
🤯
Demon’s Souls remake, TLOU Part II and now SH 2 already worth my ps5 purschase. 👍🏻
Why does it look... Not cheap but just a bit off? Is it just me?
Well the only game where pyramid head actually makes sense to be in the game , finally...
At last 🥳🥳 .. Literally celebrating 🍾 this cool announcement
I honestly dont get why they brought Akira Yamaoka back.. they could have used him for other projects, we already have the OST for the game, he already made it
No Norman Reedus now
Konami just Woke up from a long sleep, will Definitely put my hand on this one 🔥🔥🔥, and please consider Metal Gear Solid, a remake or sequel will be great there are a lot of fans out there. Thanks✌
Just take my money already (♡.♡)
He looks a little like Dale Gribble with hair.
Leon Kennedy versión adicto alos stupefacientes
That’s amazing. Why would they not start with Silent Hill 1 though?
Don't do that. Don't give me hope
Hideo Kojima
Finaly! I have something to play on the PS5.
Uh oh.  The nurses are returning?
ابتسامتي وفرحتي وكأني بحلم قسما بالله كونامي تذكرت عظمتها وتنهض من جديد 🥺😍
Meu deus
Baity estará feliz
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
AWESOME!!! This is will be a best remake in history!
Voices! Same mistake as for SH3. Bring the old voice actors back why are you so ...  Please don't destroy one more classic.
I hope this will be better than silent hill hd collection
Edge Controller is way  too expensive 🥲
2:29 I'M ALREADY LOVING THAT SOUNDTRACK
akira yamaoka songs are just *chills*
León eres tu? Jejeje
aren't teaser trailers less than a minute? pleasantly surprised
Oh no oh nooooo please don't tell me this is going to be another cash grab from konami that's going to be half arsed.
Those who haven’t played the original are about to experience a masterpiece
Still waiting for Norman Reedus to appear in silent hill.
I've never played any of the games. What is it about??
Нет. Просто нет.
Now I definitely will buy the Ps5 just for playing the best game that ever made but this time it’s the remake could it be the new best game ever made i can’t wait
Oh dear , this doesn’t look promising
grafiknya tidak improve banyak, harusnya masih bisa up lagi disisi grafiknya di PS5
Wow you are on the track  We are waiting for Dino crisis
It's like Leon Kennedy and Bill Maher had a baby.
I dont think 2 is gonna translate well
I dont think 2 is gonna translate well
Yeaayy... Pyramid head
Also doch kein MetalGearSolid schade
The graphic 😮
Oh Nice, "Silent Hill: CLEVELAND."
remake looks great but i don’t fw pyramid heads design icl
Re4 saving the girl,re7 saving the girl,silent hill 2 saving the girl,people could just stay single😜
Yess, this is perfect for my fanfiction ideas.
Like a restless dream come true.
Isn't the canon ending the cute dog in control of everything and he found out?
It almost feel like they wait for graphic to be crazy realistic and something like sound proximity effect just to bring total immersive gameplay.
I'm happy to be alive right now
It would be so cool if "Wrong Turn" movie hade some kinda game 😁
I'm hater and I don't like japanese games and I don't want see and play this game.🃏
وااااو ذكريات🥺
I am not dreaming right ...
If we fans had to pay for our sins for so long, now its time to rejoice!
I just hope they don't streamline the controls and turn into brainless garbage. Tank controls, don't dumb down the puzzles, and also fix James' face.
Might have to buy a ps5 now
child hood memoriesssssssssssssss
Покупали Silent Hill 2 для PS2 ? Покупали для PS3 ? Да ... Ну так купите и для PS5 еще раз - мы такие умные и ленивые  ! Konami
Can't wait ...
Fall 2023
روعه
Hooray. A remake of the best part of Silent Hill. I would have lived to see the release of this game. Thanks Kоnami.
Boy sounds like Keanu reeves
Still mad about pt
Создайте уже что-то новое, только и можете с классики деньги сосать, и то сделано убого… фу!
Movie name: Top Gun: Maverick
Um...where's part 1?
😭finally the Best saga ever is back!
Hopefully it eventually comes to PC!
Bloober Team? Seriously? What, did they steal some of Silent Hill's gameplay features through copyright abuse and thus were the only developers Konami could go with?
Now if only Konami can remember Jun in Tekken
Finally!!!!
Another remake.  Stop
already very slay
I am pleasantly surprised that konami is participating in this project, but I still have the feeling that it can go wrong, because this is konami, the trailer is still happy, I want to see more gameplay and I wonder if the cruelty and reality of blood will be
我超！
Now if only Komani could remake Metal Gear Solid, I'd hate them even less...
Can’t believe my best childhood game is getting a remake …….one of if not the best horror games to have ever graced this earth……fantastic news 👍👍👍👍👍
Isn't this the OG protagonist
Hate to kill the vibe. But it's Konami lol. Oh how dare you!? They listened it's a SILENT HILL 2 REMAKE! You are not a fan!! Yeah I will stick to the ps2 version until that news comes of things are not going so well on this project.
From the hipocrits of sony crying for call of duty, begging for game parity,paying to block games on game pass. Comes another game bought as exclusive🤮🤮🤮
I'm so glad Akira Yamaoka is back. His music is what made Silent Hill so chilling to play. The sounds are so industrial. Definitely the soundtrack of my worst nightmares.
Silent Hill 2 still stands as the best horror game of all time
Bad trailer. Could have been so much better
Well I guess purchasing the original is never gonna be an option ever again.
YES! <3  Thanks Konami. Remakes from 1-the last Downpour
Metal gear fans be like: why are we still here? Just to suffer
Ну что-то хз пока. Графика вроде неплохая, но в оригинале она придавала игре некий шарм что-ли.  И голос Марии какой-то не очень.
La CMA estará muy contenta de hacer exclusivooooooooossssss . Grande sony
James' face is so wrong
FINALLYYYYYYY
Welp guess I got to get a PS5 now
Is that Pyramid head?
Gives me LEON vibes from RE
Just don't be like Resident Evil 2 remake please
Happy but kinda sad I only get excited for remakes. Lol oh well
0:28  Resident Evil 7 in a nutshell
with a toilet that dirty.. i'd rather not wash my hands there! anyway ~ so excited to see this
Где Норман Ридус?? опять модами исправлять ваши касики
Anyone who has actually played Silent Hill 2 would know that this guy playing James is trying way too hard and it doesn't make sense for James as a character to be acted so emotional and gruff.
fabulous. a whole new generation of people get to experience one of the sickest psychological thrillers ever created. looks amazing. i'm pumped.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
THANK YOU KONAMI😭😭😭😭
KONAMI.
WAIT WHAT ITS BACK
Silent Hill: Downpour. Make it happen Sony.
It's just You, Jaaaaaames, and a big cold haunted Town; and after a while you begin to wonder which one of the three is Jaaaaaaames' biggest enemy. -Yahtzee
1:04 that scene looks amazing. However I do doubt that’s how the game will look when released…hope I’m wrong!
This news does make me happy BUT I'd rather they make a new game in this series than another remake.
Great, another remake of a classic game that doesn't frickin need it.
remakestation 5
This is for real...? SILENT HILL IS COMING BACK?!?!?!?
bully 2?
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I must've played the original game when I was 10 years old and immediately fell in love. The music, the eerie feeling of being alone, the mystery, the layers of meaning behind each character. After all this time, this Art piece can now be experienced by a new generation.
My heart.
GOTY
Yo this is crazy
La cucaracha al principio está perreando. XD
So where is that silent hill p.t game at?!?!
Never been a huge horror fan, but this gives me Hype! I'm very happy to see Konami finally making something exciting again!
I screamed joyfully after hearing this game would get a remaster, can’t wait to play it!
No...mames...
Playstation is back baby 🎉
😢
Konami still game publisher/ developer?
Omfg I need this as soon as possible
Looks nice!?. Where just going to forget what KONAMI did to KOJIMA.
This is cool though it would have been nice for a new one
What about psvr2?
nice but...where is P.T?
Not for PlayStation 4 🥺😭💔
OH MY GOOOOODEE
Es enserio... si van a traer la saga remaster empiezen por el SH 1.  Que falta de respeto. Y ensima exclusivo de ps5 un remaster  que mal.
FINALLY now all those bs fake trailers and other unreal engine projects can be put to rest, we now get the real thing!
I thought it was going to be the Norman Reedus one
another master piece will be destroy it
So sad that it won't be on ps4 :(
This is like a dream become true ..
PS5 CONSOLE EXCLUSIVE *also available on PC and not XBOX LOL,  Sony sure is funny
Solo estara para ps5??? Alguien me renta un ps5? 🥺
Thank you Konami!!
May dream become true
Oh man... yes yes YES.   I'm always hesitant to care about remakes but I'm taking a leap of faith this time.  I can't wait for this to hit.  They got Yamaoka back and everything.  It looks like the narrative may be a little different too but I'll go with it.
DBD fans going wild
It's so cool they brought back Pyramid Head from the movie.
Not that I'm not thrilled... but can I has Silent Hill 1 too?
They made the movie into a game .
So Awesome. Still one of my favorite games. Thank you ! 🙏
Bloober team 😢
A remake I'd gladly pay full price for. Here, Konami, take my money.
Plz don’t bait PLZ DONT BAIT 😯😯
Did not think I could excited for a Konami game what year is this!?
As I grow older I put aside video games because of the time they consume, with that being said it’s heart breaking to be in this position. I love video games and they’re only getting better, with consoles that run them even more smoothly. I put 45 hours into Elden Ring in one week on the Series X and realized I was throwing my time away. It’s hard, but I have to walk away…bless all of you who continue to carry the gaming torch and immerse yourselves into these worlds that people put so much effort into. 💯 BranHub out.
If its true I will buy ps5
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Mad respect to bloober team
Меери
finally
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹 this is precious 🥹🥹🥹 Am I dreaming?? Someone pinch me please 😭😭😭😭😭
Make something new FFS. Hardware and software it seems, have both met crossroads.
Ps5? Looks like ps3
If they do dino crisis I will loose my mind
Oh, Hello...
Trailer gave so much chills ❤️ can't not wait
My memories of Theme of Laura is resurfacing.
Long live Silent Hill
George Mcfly in Silent Hill 2: Back to the Hill
Why should i Play this if i aint got the chance 2 play a remake of part one
Is this the one that had a demo as well?
So this is a remake? Following the footsteps of capcom and their RE series I see…. UE4? So it’s a cross gen game
is this a remake?
My nightmare fuel 📈📈
This version of James has more personality...
Slient Hill main song I think is (waiting for you) One of the best song for games.
Si bello e tutto ma per James potevano impegnarsi di più, ci sono rimasta un po' male...
Sooo whats the difference between Silent Hill f and this? Im new to the whole Silent Hill universe xd
I am already terrified and screaming in fear. System req are insane
Wonder what the dog ending is going to be like 😳
wow, they do remember this game they abandoned decades ago
ito and akira both being back puts my mind at ease. This maybe the start of Konami's redemption arc.
I am so unbelievably happy beyond words
ah the musicc, kids today will finally know what true fear is
Looks like konami responded to capcom’s RE4 remake 4 months later
Perfect , except if Guy Cihi isnt reprising his role as James it wont be the same. He was perfect for this character. However everything else looks promising.
People actually enjoy playing games like this?😬🫣
Siiiiuuuu
I got a letter (again)
so Silent hill is about chick finding..?  never played this game
Mary's voice seems very much the same... same VA?
leon another universe
The real question, will it be on PC?
Take my wallet Konami take whatever you want this already looks like 2023-2024 game of the year
Y que no era mejor hacer el 1 🥺🙄
Take my money…
What a surprise. /s/
I can't wait to get my brain twisted in an elevator again! Woooo!
Same as ps3 and you want 60€+ fluck off
This is one of my favourite games of all time. Let’s hope that this team understands everything that made the original great. This looks promising so far!
So does that mean that we will get a remake of 1 and 3 as well?
So they’re making a remake of a masterpiece but shot down Kojima when he wanted to create a new start that went to the roots of the old games?… hmm…
OMFG !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ah the nightmare returns
wow
Get Guy Cihi in or no deal.
Ingat ku masih masa ku damit main game ani nyamu, anu malar migau masa tido ahir bangun lagi tu pas atu ngantuk dalam klas..gila eh tapi siuk jua, nah ani ada tia remake lagi tia tido di opis & ahir datang kaja pakah.
he still attached to his wife after all this years. if you notice the ring mark on his ring finger, it literary stated how longing his soul for his wife.
Konami finally decided to stop making pachinko machines to remake an actual gem. Thank you.
Я не верю что дожил до этого дня. Ну что, Габен. Теперь твой выход с третьей халвой!
I am very, very worried. :( I just feel like they're completely missing the dream-like tone that made the original so eerie and off-putting.  James delivers his lines like a generic action movie character and it looks like they put too much emphasis on him fighting creatures as opposed to running from them, which you usually did because the controls were clunky and the monsters could kill you much easier than you could them.  I dunno. I love SH2, but this...This really doesn't feel like it at all.  In the bad way.
Pyramidehead looking ripped, must have been lifting weights all those years
I'm really happy that Silent Hill 2 is becoming a PlayStation exclusive as well as being available for PC, and I hope it will continue to last and not become a time exclusive 😎😎😎
Something is gonna wrong: i don't feel the same emotions like in original version. And why the changed James face?
Please make it available for PC
Great but i'm not interested. Gaming is no more interesting anyways.
Callao hil 🗿
We better get our awkward and uncomfortable voice acting on point, too. That added a lot to the original.
Did SH get a remake too or did they just skip to this one? Never played the series before🤔
Guys don't forget everything has been changed since 2002 .Akira . Me . You and  silent hill 2 game ,we are not gonna get back to the old days with PS2 Gta vice city and also SH2
ok, now I need a PS5
Just finished the Whispering Hills mod from Fallout 4 and now I see this. Hope there's a reference to P.T.
I’m screaming, I love this franchise so much
This was unexpected, seems the dev team involved is the same one that did the medium and _observer. But I won't support Fukonami, will never forget what they did to MGS
I miss old school games
Bloober team being behind this, along with the disaster which was the  silent hill remaster from back in the day really makes me not so excited for this tbh. Definitely waiting till the game is actually released till I buy into the hype.
Excited for the game and all BUT, WILL THE DOG ENDING BE REMASTERED ALSO!?!?
waiting for
I’ve waited far too long. I just hope it doesn’t end in disappointment like pretty much every triple A game out now
Looks like we know Sony's next acquisition
Wow.....
This almost compensates for the Kojima Silent Hills reboot cancel.
Goosebumps!
I wonder how Kojima and Norman Reedus feel about this trailer
but in original silent hill 2 in the begining a main character  watch in mirror in YOU...
Akira Yamaoka is the best, so glad he took part in this. Can’t wait.
Leon s Kennedy is back😂😂😂
So where is Alessa?
Endlich...Endlich...hoffentlich keine Enttäuschung..
🥲🥲
Literalmente he eyaculado 69 veces viendo esté putisimo trailer
This is just crazy to me.   I grew up watching the ‘Silent Hill’ (2006)  movie and listening to my mother’s experiences of playing the earlier games.  For the longest time those two things were my only consumption of the SH world.   Earlier this year I had the opportunity to start playing the games, and I fell in love with the franchise.   I’m currently on the third game and I couldn’t be any happier playing these games.   What a time to be a Silent Hill fan.  Long time OG fan or new.
Gente é o fim dos tempos? Será se tô sonhando? Não acredito que isso tá acontecendo 🥺  Silent Hill 2 Remake e Resident Evil 4 Remake é pra matar os fãs do coração ❤️
Can Konami just release metal gear 1-4 on current gen already
2:08 everyone knows that boy but this version of him is just so soy
это должно было случиться.)
Okay whoever is forcing konami to do this.... Thank you
Why they made his face so goofy?
for second i thought it was silent hills the P.T demo but im still excited!
And when a new tekken 8 trailer please?
What has this industry resorted to? Remember when games with original and creative ideas were a thing? Remember when writers didn't have to rely on nostalgia for older franchises? I love the original Silent Hill 2, but I never wanted this. Why can't we just let this franchise rest in peace already?
When i say xbox just got stumped on they just got trampled
Very beautiful but I don't like James' eyes. They are too small, squinty and weird
somebody pinch me ha ha
сайлент хилл за Леона 👍🏽
Depois a Sony quer chorar da compra da Activision Blizzard pela Microsoft, sem contar que a Microsoft nem vai tornar COD exclusivo dela , não sou babá ovo de empresa nenhuma , mais torço que a Microsoft consiga a compra , a Sony quer é empurrar jogo a 350 reais no lombo do consumidor , tem umas táticas muito anti consumidor .
Finalmente , achei que esse dia não ia chegar nunca
Dog ending remastered please!
An instant buy for me.
Just play the original folks
This sons of their mothers remembered silent hill after so many years...
This guy,I have to call him Leon Winters or Ethan S. Kennedy
SH2 changed was the best thing to happen to PS2
Unfortunate Kojima, Ito Junji, and Del Toro's vision has been suppressed. It looked horrifying.
Is that David Duchovny?
Odeio a Konami por acabar com Silent Hills mas pelo menos veio o Remake do SH2 então odeio um pouco menos agr kkkk
What if all this time having these lil demos for the game on ps4 they was really getting us ready for the next gen and what it had in store for us this game looks beautiful and I can’t wait to get my hands on this 💯
pachingo?
I hope there will be enough stock for ps5's  in the following 2-3 years when presumably the game will launch
I would have never thought to see the day! This is such great news! Can't wait!
this is awesome
BRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I don’t think I can handle this game in 4K
So no Silent Hill 1 remake???
Is this only for PS?
Is Guy Cihi reprising his role as James Sunderland?
I have very, VERY high expectations of this remake. Been playing Silent Hill 2 like every other year for the past 15 years, researched it's lore and reading a lot of theories for these years. Seeing Masahiro Ito and Akira Yamaoka back is VERY reassuring and given studio Bloober's track record, this seems decently promising.  But let's not forget, it's not just Silent Hill's comeback, but Konami's as well to the industry. We still have not forgotten what happened 7 years ago and how they handled their I.P.s during that time. Though things are looking up for the SH series, the company needs to as well with it's staff culture, business, and relationships with developers and fans. Do it right this time Konami.
Это было здорово 👍
Долгожданный ремейк вот это тизер  все супер сделано а музыка Акира Ямаока  просто за душу берет ! спасибо будем ждать
Finally, the dog ending in 4k
We will have a recession soon. Better bring out the best titles to keep us afloat
Como esta la cosa probablemente solo sea otro shooter-heros con servidores de papel
He kinda looks like a much older Leon
Why not Silent Hill 1?.
Where’s the pachinko? 🥲
All I have to say is about time
This looks so amazing, gives me goosebumps all over. I hope Konami do the same with Silent Hill 3.
How can you sit Their eating Pizza!
Yeah!
DBD update?
Looks bad 😂😂😂😂
I've played a couple of them before but I wish we could get a current gen HD remaster or something to get me ready for that one!
I’m not scared, you’re scared.
Looks stunning
What people really need to remember. Is that the thing that made the original such a work of art and a masterpiece. Is that the people developing the game treated it as a work of art. It was their life’s work that they poured their passion into.      Unless this blooper team has that same burning passion for their work, this game is going to disappoint a lot of people.
Exlusive? cheaters!
I won't pre-order this or buy it day 1 considering how Konami treats employees and its franchises. Waiting on a full review.
Thank you. I have been waiting for this day for a long long long long long time
I still can't believe this is actually happening, after 8 years of rumours
Наконец-то! Надеюсь я не сплю
Я ждал этого 20 лет.... в Азкабане
Y para PS4 ?
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH
I just realized that I have no patience.
This is how a wish come true feel like eh?
I'm hoping Konami doesn't make me regret this being released.  I have so little faith in them.
The Resident Evil games are great without a doubt but Silent Hill 2 is truly a profound thought provoking masterpiece that is actually about something - grief and regret. I don’t think it will be as scary but I expect it to be more moving.
Yes   yes  yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1:26, my favorite scene... remake. 😃  I hope they make pyramid head ending like in homecoming! 😊
The character model face is scarier than the creatures lurking in silent hill
Lemme get this straight. Hideo Kojima makes a viral, huge overnight success of a Silent Hill demo, Konami fires him,  then continues it without him. Wow
I mean I'm excited for this but at the same I hope they expand more instead of just giving us a copy and paste remake with just better graphics.
I'm not going back there.
I wonder why silent hill 2 gets a remake rather then silent hill part 1 but it’s nice to see it never played part 2! But sure did liked part 1!
Now make silent hills
Oh yeah!!!  Can't wait!
Here we go again
Thanks to this trailer I watched both movies and now at 5.34am I have to go to bed to get 4 hours sleep to be up for work 😂 Either way I can't wait for this. The last silent hill game I played was on my pc in 2008 or 2009. I know it was a newer game because it hadn't released at that time so it was a captain jack version that wasn't in English until I downloaded the English sound files from a different source. Either way I can't wait.
FINALLY!!!
Ура мы дождались!
No kojima tho
Chapter 2 of the legend silent hill has returned.
Please don't cancel this
silencio gil, nunca supe como se escribe
Wth, is thay the same VA that voiced DBDs James
I'm sorry but i still dont repect this company anymore just seems like they were running of money and decided to milk silent hill for everything
Finally!!!
I was hoping it would be a new Silent hill.
What!!!😳
Best news ever. Hope it's unreal engine 5. Looks amazing anyway.
Silent Hill isn't just a game, its a mentality.
Looks interesting but james re-design ehhh
Woow
Well, this is going right at the top of Yahtzee's Best Game list when it comes out...
Yessss
Hearing Pyramid head's giant knife scraping across the floor is gonna bring back some bad (read as great) memories lol
I mean cool but, really 2? Not 1 but 2....
Magnificooooooo no me voy a poner crítico salga como salga el juego será una joya por fin volvió el rey del terror muchos quisieron ocupar ese lugar pero nadie lo logro
Was the second game in the holiday park?
I would rather they remade Silent Hill 4 The Room
Welp, prepare yourselves for a whole new generation of pyramid head simps
I REALLY hope they keep the "How can you sit there and eat 🍕??" Line  🙇🏽‍♀️🙏🏽
2:11 I really like the way Jame just beat that nurse tf out 😮
yes yes yes
I had already forgotten what hope felt like :')
Akhirnya setelah sekian lama...
please be also on VR
Game looks dope
Konami you have lived up to your promise and gave us what we wanted. You have been forgiven for almost all your transgressions.
He looks like john bernthal??
lol console exclusive
suikoden, then silent hill? what's next, MGS?
Una vez que pruebas el terror psicológico de Silent Hill 2 no vuelves a sentir un miedo igual a otro. Este juego provoca algo único que otros juegos de terror jamás podrán replicar.
Why would anyone want to go to Silent Hill?
I hope they remake the entire series! I'll buy them all! But please improve the gameplay mechanics
Wish it was Slient Hill 3
Yes yes yes and a million thousand yeses!
Kinda like Alan Wake 2
pero que ven mis ojos 👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👀👽
Honestly I can fully rely on Blooper Team and I am looking forward for the release
I'm scared because it's developed by bloober team :'3
Yeah I think it’s time to get a PS5
Two words:  Nostalgic, Historical  Me: Cries a lot😂
Yo. Chill with the remakes
It's kinda weird that they skipped SH1 when it could've benefited from a remake especially it's the only SH game from PS1 era.
What Homelander do in Silent Hill?
ياسلام  سايلنت هيل اخيراً 😭😭
huhuhu at last! the long wait is done.. lezz gooooo!
Looks like James Sunderland and Leon S. Kennedy went to the same barber.
The music is so haunting and melancholic. I love it so much…
NO WAYYYYYY UE5
Regálenme una ps5
Pointless remake
I’ve never played silent hill ever, so hopefully this game turns out to be top quality
Чтобы завтра уже выпустили😎
So Konami is gonna comeback like Capcom on RE2, eh?
PT 💀
This is exactly why I bought a PS5. It's taking forever but exclusives will come.
Resident evil now has true competition with silent hill 👌🏻
yes!! can't wait for the demo release and then never ever hearing about this title again!
To all SILENT HILL fans that still dont know about this: they announced 3 new Silent Hill games too.
😍😍😍😍😍 Love !
i’ll buy a p5 for this
He looks a lot like William Birkin from RE 2 Remake
Best thing that happened in my life: Resident Evil remakes and Silent hill remake and whole New Silent hill game and New upcoming Movie
is this real??? I cant believe it!
Konami always come up with legendary game
Hope they will not fail this epic masterpiece
Silent hill without hideo kojima????
I gonna rob a ps5 to play this game
Hope Konami bring back Gradius
All of the scenes are in-game engine right? Or just cinematic?
As long as at the end we still get overdose delusion as an ending song im all in
James looks too clean, maybe add some dirt on his hair
Finally 🙏🧘‍♂️
excited. however he doesnt quite look like the character, kinda looks like someone else in like a bad cosplay of it.  but still. nice.
Soy el único que no ha jugado ningún Silent Hill?
IM SO EXCITED IT LOOKS AMAZING YO
James's voice should be calm and slight.
silent hill 2 Exclusive for PS5 only that's Amazing
Oh me vengo
Vaya vaya, Playstation sacando un juego exclusivo, creí que la exclusividad era mala según ellos
Purchasing a PlayStation rn 🚶🏾‍♂️
Silent Hill 2 Remastered on PS5
Is this a remake?
I still have nightmares Of this video game !!! One of the best decisions ever made to remake this masterpiece !!! Btw Silent Hill > Resident evil.
Lets hope its not coming in 10 years or so.
leon??
Наконец-то они вспомнили про сайлент хил
Can't wait to hear "Null Moon" again
Доброе утро :)
Mi favorite horror game ever. One of my dream remakes come true. Couldn't be happier about this.
Couldn’t have been done correctly without Yamaoka. So glad he’s back.
woahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh AKIRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ARIGATOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B, I'm flarking gagged. I've been itching to get back to Silent Hill for about a decade since DownPour. They showed so much for a reveal trailer and even some of the memorable parts too. Nice.
Por fin lo hicieron :,3 volvieron a traer  a la mejor saga de juegos de terror, es momento de que silent hill se alce entre los mejores de nuevo.
Leon Kennedy’s barber must be popping.
Let's go!!!
Holy cow
Cannot wait for this my all time favorite game finally getting a remake and it looks mind blowingly amazing
Boyyyyy i hope they keep doing this till reach silent hill 4
Hill yeah. Wait... I don't have PS5
Wow I thought I clicked on a wrong video and thought I was watching some smoking ad. The graphics looks that amazing
Watch it be like FF7 REMAKE, where 3/4 of the way through the game Pyramid Head turns to James like "Actually our real enemy is DESTINY" and the two of you team up to fight a Kingdom-Hearts-assed final boss to end up in an alternate reality where his wife is still alive.
I am worried about how clean it is - for a world that was so gritty, dark and degraded, but I am still happy it exists and is being made. Hope it works out great! A remake of the original would be amazing too...
this gives me 2005 vibes all over again
It’s time to finally buy a ps5 now
Playstation buy Konami plz
F$&+#&k Hideo Kojima!! Akira Yamaoka Is la pura varilla oxidada perros!!! 💀
I'd prefer to get Silent Hills.
The voice acting sounds so generic doesn't sound dream like just sounds like a guy with a deep voice.
Cómo que le falta algo..no se sintió ese toque y la música mmm veremos el producto final
Oh lord  this remake is using unreal 5 , the immersion will be crazy ⭐️⭐️
It's been over a decade since the last Silent Hill game. This is a surprising move by Konami. It's interesting how they kept it from being leaked before this announcement!
The transition animation is basically copied from the original version
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Do someone know what Is the theme in this part please? 2:30
واخيررا اللعبه الافضل
I am so happy. This game was probably the only video game I've ever played were I was overwhelmed with raw emotions after completing it - the kinda stuff that lingered in my head for weeks. And now it's getting a remake
That song... 😌
Game grumps better play this. Their play through are so much fun.
Wow, Konami really did it....metal gear??...
Que marco na história!
Can't wait for the Dog ending in 4K
Do you think it will have the same control layout? I couldn't stand the old controls.
this is what im saying!! Id never believe anything until the official news comes! This is it ! RE and Silent Hill! Please dominate the gaming industry again!!
Some of the Silent Hill games are still the best example of horror ever done in a video game
why leon on silent hill
pqp que jogo amigo! Não sei se vou ter coragem para jogar igual quando eu era mais novo kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
This made my day much better 🔥❤️
Welcome back Silent Hill!!! Missed you, one of my favorite game series! 👏👏👏👏😊
Hope Silent Hill 2 Remake supercharged the Silent Hill franchise just like Resident Evil 2 Remake did for Resident Evil.
Man i wanna play so bad this game plz buy me a ps5😕😕
We need SH 3 :(
never thought id see the day where they make a new silent hill game
Please make it for ps4 also
I'm begging the developers, please don't Konami this up.
It’s time to grab the chainsaw and find Mary!
After  20 years. I'm crying rn.
Yay!
I like the graphics but to be honest after seeing what Nvidia did I feel the ps5 power is getting outdated, kinda crazy how fast hardware is improving
Konami never make a bad games for us. 💥💥💥💥✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
Get ready for a lot of locked doors lol
Still can't buy a PS5... not in stock.
This is remake?
پشم‌ریزان...
_You promised me you’d take me there again again someday_  *_AND THE DAY HAS COME, THANKS KONAMI! Silent Hill is back baby!_*
What engine are they using? Unreal Engine 4 or 5 I think this is the 5 one because if they using the 4 it’s gonna be a wasted of graphics I rather use the 5 one because the game will look better and smooth
Guys I haven't played silent hill 2, I own the PS3 remake but I've heard bad reviews about it, should I play it or wait for the PS5 remake?
Did I miss SH1?
i like silent hill than resident evil im glad they're going to remake this masterpieace game!
Hold on what
Let's hope it brings fear and jump scares as i remember from back then.
This isn't a lie... *right?*
I've been waiting for more than 20 years for this. Thank you!
Woooo Polacy górą  ;)
Hopefully this leads to Silent Hills being revived.
Do what’s with Japan starting of new franchises with the second game
NEVER FORGET PT, KOJIMA, AND DEL TORO!
Justo lo que esperaba, ojalá llegue también a ps4.
Konami is live
Finally Konami remembered Silent Hill
Sheesh Ethan winters
Gee... 20 seconds in and James is acting like he murdered someone. Subtle as a brick through a window.
Thank you Konami!
Can't wait for max to just play 2 like before and drop the franchise again 😂
Reviving old franchises. Playstation is certainly at it this year and I'm simply loving it!
Cautiously optimistic.
I’ve never been so happy in my life for a game release
Dont bully me as i am very dumb and have not played these games. Is this a remaster/reboot or a new game entirely
Viva sony 😍😍🎊🎉
Hoy conocí la envidia
But is it a pachinko game
can't wait to see the pyramid head again
Here we go again.
Where is Eddie?
We were expecting Norman Reedus. But the game is here and that's nonetheless. 👍🏻Thank you, we were waiting for this on PS5 badly.
Amazing.
Just waiting for norman reedus silent hill 😐
I'm Soo hyped 😍 the nostalgic everything that make u in the universe is different 😬
Wait ps5 exclusive? 😭😭😭😭😭   very sad silent hill fan
Sinceramente il volto è il doppiatore non mi piacciono moltissimo...
We waited for 20 years.
Finally Konami!! Was it so hard??? Now bring is a new Castlevania kkk
y para cuando algo nuevo? ya estoy hasta los huevos de remakes y remasters!
What do you mean a console exclusive? Blooper team is under Xbox....
shame it’s bloober team
minha nossa sinhora acho que vou chorar 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 isso tá muito lindooooooo, pfvr Konami não nos decepcione 😭   esperei por tanto tempo uma coisa decente, agora a chama se acendeu denovo 😭
Para ps4 no sale que chafa perp si se ve bien prometedor el juego
Hermoso juego de una generación pasada 300000 pesos vale en Argentina la Play 5 nunca la tendré peri bueno para solo remasterizados me quedo
Wait This is real Right?
Not liking the new voice actor, sounds too exaggerated
Beauty
AAAAAA I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR YEARS!
I for one welcome the new changes for this remake, mainly because I don't want this to be a 1 to 1 copy of the original. My concerns for this game lie solely on bloober team, and hoping that they can nail the atmosphere and tone the original had mastered, while staying true to this game being survival-horror.
Oye Sony! Esto de quejarse de las exclusividades, ¿Solo aplica para COD contra Microsoft, o solo cuando a ti te conviene?
Ps4😢
This is what I have been wating for
I'm crying for a very special game,thank you Konami.But where is that horrible siren at the end of the intro or the beginning?That would be great you can't miss it.
Time to start saving up for a PS5.
exclusivo de PS lloraran cuando cod sea exclusivo de XBOX
They made a dbd character into a real game?
Everything about this looks amazing. The essence of the original 2 is all still there, this harrowing grey melancholy mixed with the chaos. Akira Yamaoka's beautiful score setting the tone. This is a beautiful coat of paint on an original yet to be replicated. This is the game that made me feel officially, I need to buy a PS5 so I can play this art. Welcome Back To Silent Hill 🖤
I hope it will be 60 fps lol
AT LAST!!!
Want it !
We need the original music back - it's a masterpiece in this game! Without this music, it's only a half game because otherwise the atmosphere is missing.
where was the theme of laura? i want the theme of laura
W
PYRAMID HEAD
Muchas gracias!!!!!
I need to know who they have on the team who developed this game, that's the only way to know if this game will be of any value.
Don't get too excited, Konami likes to disappoint.
Tht doesn't look like ue5
I’m still shocked Konami put its name on something
why does his face look like that??? 🙃🙃🙃
Muchos lo jugaremos en PC igual que el original en su momento
Was expecting another Pachinko pr Skateboard, Im glad! Hoping to play my favorite horror game
release 2030
Where is metal gear?!
My completely uneducated-and-based-on-nothing guess is they will observe reception, sales, and refining opportunities of this game, then they'll work on SH1 for absolute banger of an experience.
Yes! YEAH! YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!  If this remake does well and if they remake Silent Hill 3, I'm gonna cry. I will be so happy.
tell me its gonna keep the intro music
FINNALY
Sad Leon Kennedy. Starring in Silent Hill 2 remake.
Beautiful 🥲
I THOUGHT ITS A NEW A SILENT LMAAOOA. the remake still looks cool though
Again PC exclusive?
why is this not tranding?
I just wanna say wow
there is hype, and there is beyond hype.
Silent hill c’est une exclu ps5 ? Ou sa sort aussi sur xbox
I will never play it but will watch the dog ending on youtube
Why can't pes get the same treatment... huh? Why??
This is such a split feeling... should i be happy or worried... this is konami after all
cant wait to see AJ angry review on this one
I AM BUYING THIS ON DAY ONE :P
One of the best horror games that I've played in my childhood with my nostalgia  ps2 , glad to see it back , now I love to see silent hill origins back also🔥
So many people falling blindly into Konamis nostalgia trap. It's Bloober, people. Don't get too excited.
just recently watched video about community remake
...my body is ready
Ummmm. . .Whaaaaaaaa???    Oh what a glorious surprise 😮 😍 ☺️
Never expected a Silent Hill 2 reboot of all things, and never expected Konami to remember Silent Hill ever again. This is a wonderful surprise.   SH2 is one of my favorite games and it still heavily inspires my writing and art. Seeing it return and looking so beautiful is a dream come true.
Why do we need this? Give us Silent Hills not a remake.
So how come there is not a trailer for a silent hill one remake? So honestly I'm a bit stoked. I never played silent hill or resin evil growing up. And now I am working on the resident evil remakes!
Amo a Série , agora só falta voltar Dino Crisis também!!
I never played SH1, but 2 & 3 were masterpieces. Color me excited.
Аааа ахуеть
All of these studios should thank CAPCOM because without them they would of never got the idea to remake their games from the ground up
I remain skeptical of its quality, and I don’t enjoy how they’re seemingly going for a more hard boiled delivery than the Lynchian nightmare of the original (including the stilted voice acting). But we’ll see.
Omgee is about time,  Komami your finally return our favorite series. Thank you so much 😭 [tears of joy]
Akira best of the Best
So so happy❤
Al fin!!!!! Tantos años esperando que felicidad.
After all this time from that teaser P.T. and strange fetus in bathroom...it is back!!
remake of the 1 part please)
I’m so excited for this remake that it makes me look stupid 😭
I remember when walking in the empty street full of fog and nothing but sound of wind blows although the graphics is so limited but the creepy feeling is intense….
Oh to wonder what Silent Hills could have been. Thanks @konami
Top 1 of the games ill watch but wont play 😭😂
Resident evil>>
Yooo makes cry just watching this trailer 😢 such a masterpiece!
He has David's Lynch face
Why start with Silent Hill 2? 🙄
Mega
Now i want the ps5 😁
Holy moly they did a great job... Finally an inner piece
Que wuapo esta Leon S. Kennedy
Is it me or does James look like Leon from the RE2 remake but older?
eating monsters full of pizza XD Guy Cihi ?? i dont think is him /:
At last, part 2!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Я конечно очень рад,но то что компании печатают ремейки,но это говорит о отсутствии идей.Это печально.
Could you imagine if this was for a Pochinko machine...
PC preparada y lista ! Jeje
Just release Hideo Kojima's Silent Hills
Look like a drunk Leon Kennedy what olds,and is don’t silent hill,is is fukersshut
Hope they keep the dog ending
it's been years of silent Hill games
PlayStation: “Microsoft can’t have Activision Blizzard because it would make consumers buy our competitors products, utilize exclusive hardware features, etc.”  PlayStation fans: “Microsoft can’t have Activision and take COD from us!!”  PlayStation: “Silent Hill 2 is a PlayStation Console Exclusive”   Super excited for it obviously, but Sony is not looking great right now with how they are carrying themselves with that situation!
james. is looking bland. if that's his final look. he's missing some patches.
POR FIIIIIN😩💛🖤
I can't wait to play it on my xbox
Please launch on PC!!!
Awesome
Der erste Teil ist eigentlich für'n Arsch .
Por fin, remake del Silent Hill 2!! Ahora solo falta uno del primero y puedo morir en paz
eu não acredito
So is this new or remastered? Why silent hill 2 not 1?
Now we need Alan wake 2
Can't wait for the remastered dog ending
*pyramid head appears*   -leonardo dicaprio starts pointing and whistling.
Maldita sea al fin 😭😭😭😭😭 y se ve realmente increíble!!!!! No puedo creer que lo estén haciendo 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The company worried about call of duty being exclusive pays for another timed exclusive
My neighbors 4 yr old was traumatized after his foolish  dad showed this clip to him.
This game is a masterpiece
And just like that Konami has redeemed itself!
Yes
No se como explicarlo, pero para mí le falta Silent Hill. Muy hollywoodense. La intención estética de SH a mi parecer siempre fue más bizarra, más deprimente, más oscura, esto no le hace justicia. O será que soy un viejo lesbiano que añora el pasado.
Leone S Kennedy
I thought Silent Hill was all done?  I'm confused, and very happy!!!
Objetivo: Jugar Silent Hill 2 Obstáculo: Playstation...
japan SHIТ
YES!
Why it's not Silent Hill 1 but 2 ☹. I haven't played 1. And it's too old to my liking to play now.😭
Ya era hora 😅🤣😅
I was so hyped until it was a console exclusive.
Team Silent is working in this? they re the really Silent Hill!! please don't destroy this game,one of the best horror game in the history!! 🖤
My favorite horror series is back… I cant believe it
Que bonito mensaje a la reguladora inglesa
Is Konami redeem itself releasing Suikoden 1&2 remaster and now Silent Hill?  Let just hope Konami treat its employee and ex-employee better.
Wait wait wait, why are we skipping SH1?
I hope that detailed roach is just not on the cutscene only
if the secret dog ending isnt back, im not buying it
Wait..what? Really? Nah. This is just cruel.
konami tobat wjkakwkakwkakwkakwak
me muero 😍
Does this open a possibility to see a Silent hill 1 Remake?
Konami: In my restless dreams..I remember that franchise..Silent Hill
I get so hyped when I watch this trailer, and then I remember it’s not being developed by a Japanese studio and then my hype begins to fade away like James Sunderland’s love of his wife.
Illojuaners... se viene 🔥☕✨
no 1 no party :(
Looks cope
Would be nice if bluepoint would remake this.
Someone pass me my controller
❤❤
I wish we saw PT again
Red flags
still no sh1 remake im disappointed
Esa parte 1:10 me recuerda a Shepherd Glen de Homecoming.
Exclusivo puf y se quejan de Microsoft xD
Hope they leave the dog ending intact.
Old Leon Kennedy
I can’t wait for this it looks incredible 🙏
Whoa whoa whoa
I refuse to play a silent hill game that Kojima is not a part of.
I got goosebumps!!!! Can’t wait
NO WAY
This should have me immensely excited. But this is the modern game industry and Konami.
The silent hill!!!!                       THE SILENT HILL IS REAL!!!!!!!!!!
Silent Hill 2 Remake > Silent Hill HD Collection
I was just glad that there would be a new Silent Hill and immediately upset. Not only is this a remake, James also looks like a big-nosed old man. Where did you go that handsome guy??? and Mary on the preview? what's up with her face? The characters are completely redrawn.
Ok now I have to buy a ps5
Was I the only one expecting a pachinko machine to get revealed?
I swear! If they don't put in the secret dog ending like they did in the original, I'm gonna be very disappointed!
Think this makes up for Silent Hills??  Yeah it kinda does…
Why not ps4???
mi cuerpo me esta diciendo que esto va salir mal :I
He looks weird tbh
Where's Silent Hill 1?
I'm so happy! I never felt so hyped since P.T, I cant wait for this.
Xbox fanboys cryin right now
2:47 >_<
2:01 Leon is really tired of Ashley
Главное, чтобы в игру не добавили перекат и прицел с плеча
It can't be Silent Hill without the big triangle head man
Finally, i can rest in peace now. Thank you Konami.
Soooooo no PC?
oh no oh no, blooper team, ohh nooo, please noo not that.....
Out of all the teams why Bloober Team???
Wait, did they remake SH1 at some point and I missed it?
can't believe leon making an appearance on silent hill 2
guys this make me cry hard finally silent hill will comeback i miss it so much
*Fanboy scream*
Spoilet Alert: This is a pachinko game on your PS5!
This is absolutely amazing
I'm so happy game creators have realized how badly we want to play remastered games from our childhood. They don't even have to write or create a new world. Just update an old game haha
plz be available on PS4!!!!! so excited for this!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤
Ah yes the best silent hill, if you haven't seen the team silent doc do it
The best Silent Hill game ever.
Graphics look amazing. This game looks like it will be worth the wait.
😱😱😱😱😱
Could've had silent hills
Nostalgic
This just made my day! Thank you Konami. ❤
Isn't it beautiful 🥲....
Ojalá también lo lancen para PS4
I WISH I KNEW HOW TO QUIT YOU!!!
Bruh
SILENT HILL IS BACK LETS GOOOOO I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH..❤️🔥🔥🔥
I wanted a mgs remake .
Por fin te vuelvo a ver
This is your chance, Konami.  A chance to restore the faith of your fans.  We all will be waiting...
Brought a tear to the eye
What the!!! When was this announced!!! 🤯
I can’t believe my eyes this feels like a dream finally Konami hoping we’d get Remakes of the 1-3-4 next 😍can’t wait for this I’m so pumped
Ethan has a popular clothing style
All I think about is the "baggage" you pick up before hospital and lose it after hospital.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
im not a buying a ps5 to play it. if its not available for ps4 then ill just watch the playthroughs.
Increíble, sinceramente nunca jugué el Silent Hill 2, de hecho solo jugué el Silent Hill 3 y me resulta una saga espectacular, esperaré con ansias para jugarlo día 1 con mi Ps5 😁
Why did they have to use a Leon hairdo?!
This is nice and all but where’s Spider-Man
denle esteroides al cabeza piramide, ahora es el cuerpo piramide
😐😐😐😐😐😐
Yo me quedé en la play 2......despues puro Darck souls en PC....pero viendo esto.....creo que estoy pensando seriamente en comprar una play 5
Blonde Markiplier
Unreal Engine... seriously? Sheesh
Leon Kennedy? Xd :D
Y'know, seeing Pyramid Head in this game (after all these years) would've actually meant something if the western developers didn't shoehorn him in their "Silent Hill" games, diluting his impact.   Also, I'm somewhat disappointed that this isn't the remake of the original SILENT HILL. It's the one game in the series that deserves it the most. Anyways, I hope someone from TEAM SILENT is overseeing this, because seeing Bloober Team as the developer isn't giving me a lot of hope. Here's to hoping this does the original version justice.😒
IT'S HAPPENING! WE AREN'T DELUSIONAL! 😂
Esté me lo llevo de día uno, sí o sí.
BOOOOO PUT IT ON PS4
Huh 1:54 used MGSV weapon development ambience noise. That’s pretty cool.
Bad idea. Remember how the last two went. They are going to f*ck it up again, Konami are still idi*ts who make terrible decision. Wanna play the best version possible, download the fan made enhanced edition, still has great graphics and I mean polygons, not art direction is still is sperb.
Are they saying that this version of James is the PT protag?
Another AAA Title coming forward for Playstation meanwhile Microsoft still twiddling there thumbs thinking cod will save them this year ....
Excellent 👍🏻
Estoy llorando 😭
should have played theme of laura in this one..
Next is mgs3 or mgs1 remqke
:0
Here take my money!
KONAMI🤡🤡
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Never i thought to live and see konami do anthor silent hill game welcome back❤️
I guess pachinko isn't making Konami money anymore.
Removed the fixed camera angle and tank controls, thank you for ruining silent hill 2.
Silent hill tipo: "No pudieron vivir con su fracaso, ¿Y eso a donde los llevó?... de vuelta a mi
FINALLY! I hope they make more Silent Hill remakes. Can you imagine, see Silent Hill Origins back?
....😑
Etaaaaaa gloriaaaaa!!! 🙌🏻
PlayStation for the win again ❤
When will it release?
the time has come...
Буду ждать с нетерпением!
These graphics are gorgeous. Hoping this is what the game actually looks like while playing.
😭💕
It's been a long time coming.
this teaser felt like it took longer than a whole movie for some reason
Eres tan hermoso como el día que te fuiste.  Lo malo es que no tengo play 5
im glad i got me a ps5 for christmas cant wait whenever this game comes out
Hopefully it's the original soundtrack remastered though.
sileeeeeent hilll finallyyyyyyyyy
Ufffff 🔥 Can’t wait
James looks like he's 50 here lol.
Love it
I hope it comes to Xbox series X but if it doesn’t I’ll gladly buy it ps5. (12 months isn’t a bad wait for it to come to Xbox and PC, hopefully by then they would have fixed out most of the bugs and glitches.)
I don't know if I want this. SH2 is near perfect game. I will play it but I don't know if I want it.
Epic, can't wait. Glad they made sure there's fog in the remake. I was disappointed when it turned out there was no fog in the remaster because the fog was just an unintended side effect of the limitations of the hardware back then. The fog really sets the ambience of the game.
Theradbrad is gonna get mad happy..
Ya era hora que hicieran o retomaran tan buena saga.. de élite…..sin duda alguna uno de los grandes juégos de terror… ya quiero jugarlo……
I NEED TO PLAY THIS MASTERPIECE
Really hope this isn't a PS5 exclusive....
If this is a masterpiece like the original, I will forgive Konami.
Glad to know i’m not dreaming and this isn’t some new pachinko machine
Unreal engine, 30fps cap?
This is more like konami last resort lol. I really glad they revive silent hill series again
Silent hill 4 remake pls
Hoping please this is 60fps. 🤞Worrying with Gotham knights and Plague Requiem setting a 30fps trend😯
the hype is unreal
Seriusss ahhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Waahhhhhhh
Mano , que anuncio foda , pena que vai ser so pra ps5 , daki uns 10 anos eu consigo jogar hahhahaaahah 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Please tell me 2:18 is the dog ending 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cant wait to see James Sunderland stick his hand in a toilet in HD
Please keep original OST. I also hope we can switch from PS2 graphics to new-gen like in Halo.
Now the PS5 has TWO games
Leon Multiverse:  Resident Evil 4 Remake Silent Hill 2 Remake
Why the character face looks depressed af
I hope we can unlock the "dog ending".
Konami don't mess this up.
I'm a bit underwhelmed not gonna lie
Welp, it's official. If a company wants to come back from a downfall, make a remake and it's *sure* to bring you back up IF you do it right.
WAIT THERE IS SH2 ALREADY 🤔
only for ps5??
Kind of looks like a Telltales game. I'm glad to see it exists and I'll feel better when I see gameplay.
Ngl, won't be the same without the OG voice cast
El trauma de mi niñez vueleve en remake 😢🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Music is amazing. I can't wait the game.
I can't wait to play this game. Thats so memorable when i was kid on psx
My top one is back, akira yamaoka coming back!!!! awesome!!
I wouldn't go buying tickets for the hype train just yet...
Nice!
So where's Silent Hill 1?
So lame, just give us the Pachinko machine like we want already.
Is this a dream? 🤩🤏🏻🤏🏻
Omfg it's been so many years. Thank you😭😭😭😭😭
Silent Hill 2 and RE2 had the same idea for male protagonists.
Опять не первая часть Сайлент Хилла.
When Microsoft acquired Activision, you said that it was a monopoly and the like, and for fear of my new video coming down on the values, it's okay, and you Now you are putting Saint Hill exclusive for you for about a year and with this decision there is a large group of players who will not be able to play it and you have canceled the conference because this is a trump card for Microsoft, but the number of exclusives that will be shown.
No kojima...
why does he look like an older version of Leon from RE lol
You seem to be a fan of Hideo Kojima games
es hermoso🤩. Pero necesitamos un remake de silent hill 1
Chef’s kiss
Pro Ruso 👍🤣🤣🤣
Paia
when ifs your favorite game but you have an xbox😭😭😭
Silent hill2 y 3 resident evil 2, metal gear, Dino crisis 2, gran turismo 2... Esos juegos marcaron mi adolescencia. Maldita nostalgia toma mi dinero!!
So Konami ... Congrats  Now let's talk about Castlevania and Metal gear But step by step
Well I'll be damned.
So another remake instead of PT Silent Hills? I enjoy remakes but Konami shot themself in the foot imo.
não se esqueçam de 1 único detalhe, é da konami:/
I can’t believe I got so excited because I thought they were porting the og game to other consoles and I thought that was impossible, but I’m so disappointed. Amazing games don’t need remakes. The experience i enjoyed is from that game and not another which looks like it
what is silent hill 1, it is a reboot of the ps one?
la leyenda de silent hill 2, solo esperaba que silent hill regresara algun dia, y no en forma de fichas
Leon Kennedy sure aged hard in this one.
YES
So they're remaking the silent hill series. Sweet. I'm not a huge fan and didn't play all the games but there was a point in which the series began failing no?
Needed more nurses OufdOIUIJFJFJF
exclusive para una consola que tienen 5 personas en el mundo
gravity was the most important component in the past gen of videogames, i think you didnt get it
So instead of making a new Silent Hill game, they decided to do a remake 😐. Man! 😢 Hope that Silent Hill that Kojima wanted to do could see the light one day.
Nice a remake.   But no wishlist.  Already a bad start
Silent Hill finally coming back after years of let downs was one of the best things that this month  had
Idk why but he looks japanese
De los mismos desarrolladores de "the medium" y "blair witch", no me convence este remake en sus manos. ZZZzzzzz....
Finally, the wait was pretty worthy.
esto si que es cine
Kiss Konami💋 Also thank you for not telling me who is James voice actor is, I read his name after completeing the game and watching end credits 😁
So happy silent hill is back 🖤
Hopefully Sony doesn't make this exclusive in any way.....
I only played like 3 hours before I gave up on my ps now connection. I'm excited to finally properly experience this.
Still waiting there, in my restless dreams...20 years later
can't wait for Yahtzee to find out about this...
Is it just me or there's something very wrong with his eyes? I can't quite put my finger on what exactly is wrong, but... it's very uncanny
Pire bande annonce du monde, ça donne pas du tout envie de jouer au jeu. On dirait un jeu de cassos dépressif le seul truc qui nous rappelle un tantinet que c'est de l'horreur c'est pyramid head à la fin et c'est nul.
Que belleza 😍, por fin después de 10 años volvió silent Hill !!!!
tears of joy, frfr
It's happening!!! Mom!!! It's finally happening!!!!!!
I think it was just a matter of time before Konami hopped to the Remake train after Capcom
That's the most Asian looking white guy I ever seen
Waited all this time for an f-ing remake. Thanks konami, glad you're still worthless.
Major PT and Death Stranding vibes. Also, the music is its own masterpiece.
I'm all in!
this looks incredible
Konami: cuantos silent hills hacemos? Productores: SI.
Dá pra fazer melhor...
Svaka čast !🤯🥳
No way is this real
Now this is an actual horror game!! Nostalgia overload
NO FREAKING WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!! the best game of the franchise !!!!!!!!!
Suggestion: Please improve hair physics more in gameplay just like in cutscenes. Thank you!
uma das melhores franquias já feitas! espetáculo!
Le van a hacer remake a sailent hill 2 que genial que genial.
Holy molly
It looks promising but question we still getting all endings from ps2? Even though Is brand new graphic making it realistic
Leon Kennedy if he was basic
Wooow thanks Konami u the best company i swear🥺❤️
Wait what? 😮
probably gunna be canceled XD
Does this mean they are finally going to make a new game?
I need that silent hill downpour remake
F*** now I have to buy a playstation 5😍🥰
This remake will be a main reason for me to get a PS5 now
Why are people excited when original director for the game has been booted because of greed?
It’s refreshing to know that Konami hasn’t forgotten about this series. Now we need Metal Gear Rising 2
I can't believe it. It is real.
I don't think SH2 is really improved by adding super detailed, realistic graphics.
Too bad they snuffed Kojima. Will never buy.
1:48 he looks like Leon from RE.
Now please do a Donkey Kong remake.
Never going to be able to play this because I still can't find a PS5 two years later.
Never played a SH game . But keen for this
hope this comes to pc
This looks amazing. I saw that you had a Silent Hill game and was bummed it was for PS3. So glad it will be available on PS4 and 5
In my restless dreams, I play that game... Silent Hill 2
Okay Konami, I see you making things right 👀 Now we wait for the Metal Gear series to be remade.
Why is this giving me Alan Wake vibes?
ありがとうコナミ
Mixed feelings about this. I never had the chance to play the original myself, but I've seen enough of it to know why it worked so well in the PS2 era. I'm glad that Konami acknowledged the fact that most fans will know the ending, hence a significant part of the dialogue, but there's no sign of Eddie or Angela in the trailer, leading me to believe they could have been cut. As a side note, I wonder if Konami and PlayStation are going to start erasing channels on YT for daring to show the PS2 game like Sega did with Shining Force in order to boost search rankings?
Wow my initial reaction to seeing the thumbnail was wow another remake but as soon as I was 15 seconds into the trailer a whole bunch of memories of playing the original on the PlayStation 2 came to me and I just started to smile at these graphics and almost feel grateful that this has been remade now I just need Onimusha to come out
If they remake Silent Hill 3 too,  I will actually scream
Wow I really felt this. Never played a Silent Hill either.
Don't touch that dial, now. We're just getting started!
I hope they put some twist on it so its not an exact copy of the original game just with better graphics/controls
Maldito playstation y si exclusividad, ojalá xbox les haga exclusivo call of duty
I only have one question if Konami making this what bluepoint games working on then because i thought  it was them?
Pls remake the silent hill 1 too in the coming sequel
Aman allahım
When I was younger and played so much Silent Hill, I wanted to live there. I had dreams of that place.
reborn of one of the most classic game of all times, SILENT HILL 👌
I'm very enthusiastic about seeing more of this as a 90s boy!  I'm not much of a gamer any more, but I do have to say certain parts of this trailer look more PS3 than PS5?
It’s about time!
I feel like this is the in water path
This can’t possibly be real, I won’t believe it until it’s physically in my hands
Finally!!
Bring it to PC please!
they can say what they want but that's not the james i knew
Jon Bernthal
Hope the dog ending doesn’t get cut, or I call bullcrap and won’t buy it
Was watching other people reacting  most people: James looks older/strange but thats what we've been waiting for  after seeing bloober team remaking it:NOOOOOO!!!!!
I am not sure if this game needs a remake...
I always think that James Sunderland is Leon Kennedy on crack staying high on purpose
Aaaaahhhhhhhhh....it's happening....must keep calm 😭😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 best Halloween announcement ever 🔥🔥
Never played this game so excited to play it
I can't wait to play it on my Xbox one s!!
Bloober team will develop this game? i have a bad feeling about this :'(
АХУЕТЬ ПРОСТО, СПАСИБО, А ТЕПЕРЬ ВОЗЬМИТЕ ВСЕ МОИ ДЕНЬГИ И ДАЙТЕ МНЕ ПОИГРАТЬ В ЭТО
🧐
Que increíble que voy a poder disfrutar de nuevo este juego, uno de mis favoritos de todos los tiempos.
I can’t wait this is awesome looking
So that’s what the rumors was! Their remaking Silent Hill 2. Oh man this is gonna be an emotional roller coaster
Hit this if you like chicken nuggets
I never had the chance to play this game before, so seeing that Konami remembers Silent Hill and is remaking Silent Hill 2 is so exciting for me
YES, YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I hope the dog ending is in this remake
Exclusive of PS thats cool, but why xbox cant Buy COD? 🤔
bruh
Finally a new generation can experience this masterpiece. We played and loved this back before graphics were a thing. Hope it's not another RE remake style game...
Si bien estoy super emocionado por esta noticia, el estilo visual de James no me llena el ojo. Su cara, su cabello y su ropa no me convencen.   Es algo que podría decir que los remakes de Resident Evil han hecho excelente. alejarse de detalles que para estos tiempos son "caricaturescos", por otros foto realistas que van acorde a las nuevas graficas, sin abandonar la inspiración original de la obra.  Necesito ver mas al resto de personajes para saber si sucede lo mismo. fuera de eso, !Increible noticia!
Its a remake ?
The best f4ck1ng videogame of all history is f4ckin5 BACK KKK!!!!  I CANT BELIEVE IT!!!!!!
Release date please 😭💔
Well, it's no Silent Hills but it's better than pachinkos and I never got the chance to play SH2. yay
We need this game no matter what!! In our PS4! Just like resident evil 4 remake!! If we don’t receive that copy. Capcom will be Always better !! Just think about it
If Konami really wanted to do right by their fans, they would give us Silent Hills that Kojima and Guillermo del Toro were working on, not these cash grabs. How are these cash grabs? Well you can tell they are because Konami were all about Pachinko machines not too long ago, and the fact that they announced multiple titles all at once for a single franchise... if that doesn't scream cash grab from the notoriety of a franchise's reputation, I don't know what does.
This almost makes me willing to spend 1k on a console.
Mannnnnnnn I can’t wait .. huge silent hill fan and glad they remade at least one of them .. might play the original on PlayStation 1 for ol time sake before playing this
Ps5 exclusive I’m just not going to play it how about dat
Finally !
IM CRYING..
I’m too young to have played the originals but I wish I could’ve and I’m for sure getting this
I’m hoping that this game will be on pc but you know let’s have hope seeing that I desperately want to play a silent hill game
Cant wait to see silent hill origns being remastered
And where's silent hill 1 remake?!
When James said "it's Hilling time" and then he Pyramided all over the place, it sent shivers down my spine. Truly, a game of all time.
Love ❣ Silent Hill 🤑🤙
Hey kojima your games gives me jumpscared, evil within and resident evil combined
ay tengo miedo, y no es el juego.
I cannot describe how excited I am right now. That put the biggest smile on my face
If this a ps5 exclusive ima KMS. My favorite series got most of these
PS5 exclusive    for now
How do I get into Silent Hill? I've always wanted to play it.
Ааааааааа
Ummm. What did I just watch
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
I hope he reaches into a toilet again
Yeay! Gonna see my man pyramid head!
🥲 al fin
This is Konami saying  "We're tired of being said Kojima carried us. No, we know what were doing"
Is this PT??? Or is this something else?
*_Es hermoso!_*
I hope they have the dog ending :D
I LOVE IT
depressed face in a nutshell
Bloober team and action..? It's just a fail
Where’s Daryl 😳
Not on Xbox. Hopefully PC. Otherwise skipping.
Fkn F I N A L L Y!!!!!
Waos
I can't wait to play this Silent Hill pachinko game
Big big fan of this game
Tô meio assim ainda sobre esse trailer. Não me convenceu.
Just come to my PS5 SILENT HILL 2
Ma che faccia da pirla gli hanno fatto a James?! Bah...
Eu não acredito que vivi pra ver uma coisa dessa. Simplesmente perfeito 🤩 Alô EA Games, aprenda com a Konami (i Need a Need for Speed Remake game)
Ps4 pro absolutely can handle this game
An actual next gen looking game. Took long enough.
What engine are they using ?
Our restless dreams came true
Wow, all failed deals and hype were worth the wait with this level of graphics.
Konami..it's a start
It's really happening guys ... finally
Sorry but I don't trust Bloober to have the skill/talent to remake what is arguably one of the best survival horror games ever. All the games they have made, barring Observer, are literal trash.
There was a HOLE here its GONE now
Why is the hill silent? Does the main character ever disturb the peace so that it’s just a hill?
Yea now can we get a new motorstorm
Only thing I don't like is the name Bloober attached to it.
Will it be on steam?
Please don't buy this day 1. As cool as the trailer looks, use your common sense, wait for reviews, save your money.
HIT THE LEVER!!
So beautiful yet so terrifying
Q graficossss
I never played any Silent Hill games but always saw that Silent Hill 2 had serious drama and emotional weight beyond the horror parts and this graphics update really shows that.
Oooohhhh man that was right on the feels ❤️. Im so happy that I am alive to witness this ❤️
I get it. The 2nd one is the most popular. Its going to make more money. But it's still odd to just skip over the original.
Since when were teasers 3 minutes long
I love Silent Hill 2 opening movie
Did the plinko game not do it for ya Komani? Gettin' in on that REmake huh?
*If I have nickel for everytime an game corporation make remake of their old game when they were getting poor, I've had a bunch of nickels which is surprisingly a lot*
Did they remastered part 1 already?
yess! 🔥🔥
YES! Never played the original, but I've been hoping to see this kinda thing ever since the excellent RE2 remake.  Hopefully this goes well and Konami is encouraged to put money into properly restoring the franchise instead of making pachinko machines...
I guess I'll have to wait for it to release on steam eventually
Only for PS5 and PC? No PS4?
"In my restless dreams, I see that town. Silent Hill. You promised you'd take me there again someday. But you never did."  21 years later this phrase still gives me goosebumps.
Obrigado Konami e Sony por trazer meu terceiro jogo favorito de todos os tempos refeito.
i.. dont believe this..
Al parecer contrataron a David Yates para hecer este horrible remake.
Pensei que seria outra continuação,más tudo bem e um bom remake
Beat this game an enormous number of times when I was little. This is the game that will make me buy a PS5.
I love it! ❤
I don't care, where is the pachinko?
Ive never owned a playstation, but im willing to buy one just cause of this
probably watched it 100 times already cant wait for this man
AKIRA YAMAOKA IS BACK!!!!!!
I'm keeping my expectations VERY low tbh
After Covid pandemic, now I have to return to that city called Silent Hill, ohh boys this ps05 reminds me ps02 when I was a Kid. I am eager yo play this again. Hope I can play metal gear 1 remake please Konami.
I still hating KONAMI, i hope this don't be other HD collection.
Pyramid Head can now catch us in 4K. Oh joy…
i cannot believe my eyes
akhirnya! lumayan lah dari pada enggak
I thought the original silent hill was made by capcom not konami. Getting this game for my PS5 regardless. I never played it on PS2 but I love horror. Sounds like I missed one of the best horror games back then.
wow...
Hopefully they don't abandon it
ahhhhhhhhhhhh me muero
Not bad lot studio not can made more game quality like we hope project remake Again game awesome most like redemption with gamer
:,)  Today my heart feels full. So glad Akira Yamaoka and Masahiro Ito are in on this.
This is beautiful and shockingly gorgeous..to think they finally remade silent hill..
Is this what I think it is?!?!
Hoy gano la industria del videojuego!!
i’m literally doing a playthrough of the original game on my twitch channel and now i see this
ps5 exclusive
only a matter of time until they made this. cant wait to check it out! was in the hearts and minds of gamers for a very long time.
I'm still not over P.T. Silent Hills.
Pls let RPG-7 exists in this game 😂😂
I just wanna play PT man... This is exciting and all, but it just reminds me that the current best horror experience of all time can't legally be played
This looks very beautiful and I really hope you took the time and care into the finished game as you did this trailer
I'm so freaking happy they are remaking this game. It's the absolute best. And that scene where they're running from PH, hopefully in the remake it's as intense as the og 🙏
James honey, did something happen to you? After we got separated in that.....?What Happened to your face?said Maria XDDD
Fingers 🤞🏽,  I think mgs is next
Still have the original Silent Hill 2 and fat PS2. No need for a remake in my case, lol.
🥲……..
Please let this be true
You know what was better, the PT trailer Kojima was making before you idiots cancelled it.
I liked the Fortnite banana at the end. Lol
is this a remake?
beautiful
Love Silent Hill 1 and 2 Konami Do Snatcher Next
Fake
Pasa por la cafeteria de silent hill 1? eso quiere decir que estaran conectados silent hill 2 y silent hill 1?😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱?? Seria Épico❤️
I finally realized who looks to be the actor playing James.  It’s Luke Roberts from Black Sails.  Almost positive

Csmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
I finally realized who looks to be the actor playing James.  It’s Luke Roberts from Black Sails.  Almost positive
bro for years I have been saying I need another silent hill game with better graphics and awesome horror gameplay😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I just kept waiting for "HIT THE LEVER!! 🍒💰7️⃣" As a fan since early childhood that lived through all the ups and mostly downs I just can't believe my favorite franchise is getting the respect it deserves.
THE BEST SILENT HILL IS GETTING REMADE?! YES!!!
🌫❤️🌫
Another Game 😭 No more wishful thinking! I hope they will also release a PS4 DISC
oh look it’s leon from resident evil jk
só ps5 ou vai sair pra pc tambem? É o meu silent Hill favorito
I don’t get it??? Why is there a Silent Hill 2 remake but not Silent Hill 1??? Wouldn’t it make sense to start from the beginning for those players who haven’t played SH before?? 🤷‍♂️
Fake ahhhh Leon 💀😂😂
Ya volvemos a Silent Hill
Is this real? I must be dreaming
Can't wait to Replay the opening scene over and over in 4k
david beckham stranded in the mist
Why are we getting a resident evil copycat?
It’s real!?
Konami trying the RE remake formula
Crazy we're actually seeing this trailer and that Akira Yamaoka is returning to do the music again! Looking forward to more developments about this!
Why play something new when you can pay $60 for nostalgia?
YASSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please, remake to devil may cry 2💥💢
Is this the second time they remade this game?
KO- KO- KONAAAMIIIIIIIIIIII ❤️😭 TANK YOU SO MUTCH!
sheesh....Pyramid Head
I hope to see something written in comic sans
Can't wait to play this on PC
Huh, somehow the cutscene face looks more animated than the og version
they're been remaking these old games left and right. this really concerns me. knowing that this is the lazy way to get profit and developers getting lazy to make new game.
Silent Hill 2 is one of my favourite games and this trailer reeks of deceitful mordern gaming pretentiousness.
A BIG F** YOU to all those who were mocking and said it’s another pachinko machine! I was waiting for this 🤫
Bring his original voice back you fools  And why does he look like a haggard Leon from RE? Come on
Freue mich schon es auf meinen Kanal zu streamen
I'm glad to born in a world where silent hill exist
Skipping over Part 1 huh.
Always wanted to play this one!
Resident evil 4 remake and now this. This year is going to be amazing. The child me is now very happy to see his favorite games coming back. I can't wait.
❤❤❤
I would have preferred a remake of OG Silent Hill if I was to want a remake. I love Silent Hill 2, but 1 needs a remake more. Also I am torn... cause its Konami...
The original is soo iconic at this point. Although this looks great, it seems sacrilegious. Maybe it's the konami drama behind this series. I don't know, a very strange feeling...
RAAAAAHHHHHH YESSSS
At this point, I just wanna play games that are fun and actually makes sense gameplay wise and has a purpose to it  That why I live AC games, hopefully this game could be something
Long have I waited
this is one of the best horror games ever made, also my favorite one, glad that they will make a remake
I was waiting for the music to cut off at some point and the siren to go off… the chills
Remake?... C'mon, please don't.. better, do a remaster... And James Sunderland must be Ewan McGregor
also, i got bored an didnt finish watching it
I am so Happy, excited, speechless, I just never thought we'd see this day!!! And Silent Hill is back!!!!
Best game in the series!
Leon from Wish
its gonna be released broken af an most of what was saw here will be cut😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
When james open the door. I swear my body can't resist 😭😭😭
Ok mgs next pls
Konami been taking notes from capcom..
buh
Why can't we get them remade in order.silent hill one would be Amazing
Hola debo decir que el darle una  ueva vida a este Re-clasico de la PS2 con un lavado de  cara, para la consoló PS5 es algo que se agrádese; bien hecho konami... Saludos desde Colombia pá.
Hey Konami! When you bringing mgs3 to pc?
I would have optimism for this if I could play it anyway where but PlayStation. And is this really the reason silent hills was delayed or cancelled for? I have a feeling that this something that won’t be faithful to the original. James in this teaser is already a major red herring.
Well looks like I'll be getting a ps5 after all. lol
And just like that, once again, the gaming community forgets years of ill will and hostility from a long corrupted gaming company and will go on to shell out too much money for an unfinished, low effort product that will ultimately be an insult to the spirit of the original vision. No thanks.
Finally!!!!!!!
Cant wait to watch someone play this game because i cant buy it xD
I kinda hope they still used the fixed camera angles
Nooooo wayyyy
It was the dog!
Am I awake 😱
Tô no hype obrigado titia Konami 😍 amo esse game e tava na hora de um Remake
Now please release an AAA game Konami
Is this another resident evil game 🙄
to bad you flopped on PT.....its been years and nothing even close to that has come out.... every chance you get seems to be wasted
O right kids time to go to bed, now it's time for the parents to play
This is amazing 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Xbox + Activision-Blizzard
Looks amazing! Epic!
Incredible, a deepest psychological horror gem of the saga returns on the new consoles. I imagine what this game will be like if the writers and the soundtrack of the talented Akira Yamaoka are maintained. I couldn't be happier. I spent so much time to see the mist, an icon of the terror
Valla, al fin nos escucharon. Que mal pedo que sea para PS5; porque soy pobre. Xd
Hey is that the baby sink?
no ps4? ok i gonna pass this time
thankfully the mist is back, hope they don't focus too much in combat in a horror survival game and that does not feel too short or something...
Unreal hair physics
Im getting goosebumps all over again! It’s so beautiful 🥹
is that pyramid head?
WHAAAAAAAAT? IS SERIOUSLY????? :00000?
Prepare for woke in 3 2 1...
Should have brought back Guy Cihi.
Leon on his 50s 😆😆😆
This generation feels like every other release is a horror game.... not paying anyone to scare the ish out of me...
Cant believe that this masterpiece and series is back. I hope bloober team proof us that they deserved to be the remaker of one of the best games ever made.
A true next generation experience.
The Wait is over. I finally see that town again. Silent Hill. You've taken me back once more. Thank you PlayStation! Gonna jam out to Akira Yamaoka!
Los de Xbox bien tranquilos, pero ellos llorando por COD jaajjajaj
This  gonna be insane!!!
Wonderful.
This looks horrible i stick with the original PS2 version
They better not botch up that graveyard scene.
Based Konami has revived Silent Hill! So sad woke Sony took the exclusivity.
A remake from 21 years!
Wow, it is not a pachinko game. Crazy...
what!!!?? Is this actually happening?!!😱😭😭 hearing that melancholic piano tune sent shivers down my spine!
I guess they went back to P.T. and brought it back in a big way, this time.
nunca crei comprar un juego el dia de su lanzamiento
PLEASE TELL ME TJIS ISN'T A DREAM, WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING SILENT HILL
Nurse is hot 🔥
Is this a remake?
That wedding ring tan line is just 😘👌
Hey is this also coming for ps4 please answer
Surprised they picked Bloober Team to develop this classic. I bought Layers of Fear 2 for the One X. A WALKING SIM that didn't run well on either quality or performance modes. I haven't bought one of their games since. I seriously hope they are up to the task on this one.
The voices of New actors looks so weird They can't be better than the original game , the level is to high level 😂
Wait Konami is back to making games??
Coming soon to a pachinko machine near you...
El juego ya esta hecho , sólo son gráficos actuales
No way!!!
...
"May contain content inappropriate for children"   May. 😂😂😂
Goodbye Hasan
Come on PlayStation… let the exclusive idea go. Time to move on and share with different companies who also wants to make money. It’s 2022 now not 2000 or under.
horrible main character they changed the style drastically
I have hope for this project because it's not being made by Konami. Please please don't be bad.
To all the new babies that weren't even born when this came out. Welcome.
This town is full of monsters! How can you see there and eat PIZZA?!
dont cancel this one also
I haven’t played the silent hill games! Can someone please tell me where to start with these new remakes?
@baitybait dios te ha oído
hope they kept the shiba
pc is better
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Exclusivo PlayStation, pero tienen miedo de la venta de Activision. En fin
Ps4 para cuando
This trailer was uncanny in a Hallmark Movie kind of way
QUE DEUS ABENÇOE MDS 😭
Oh man, the rmade cutscenes for this new pachinko machine are fire!!!
for once i am happy i am still alive on 2022 :)
1:52 mgsv, mgo3 menu sound
Maybe they'll include a no-monsters option and NOT LIE ABOUT IT this time.
I'm shocked this isn't a Pachinko game.
Wow, the developers don't understand Silent Hill 2 at all lol
Letzzzzz goooooooooo
so excited
Now if we can get a new Castlevania game that would be great. Konami should put PT back on the PS Store for like $5-10. It's free money.
I don't have a PS5, I have a PS4 and it would be great if Konami remasters the team silent games. it was going to entertain me a lot until i got a ps5
Porque no sacaron para consolas de PS4
ITS BACK
Hopefully it’ll release in 2023 lol or early 2023
🤯🤩😍🎮👍🏻
o dia chegou
Lets goooo
This is amazing. You can actually see the pain and sadness in James' eyes, something that would be impossible on old gen hardware.
Bloober... ☹️
Yawn fest.
MY BODY IS READY!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hopefully Konami will let people download the PT trailer. That would be awesome.
I'll believe it when I see it
P.T Remake
I’ve never played a Silent Hill game but I’m really happy for all of the fans and I’ll consider picking this one up.  Wish Konami gave this kind of love to Metal Gear though…
Im hype now !! but if they remake the SILENT HILL PS1 im gonna be jumping happily
Pirâmide head
This doesn't look bad by any means but also doesn't look overly impressive. Definitely expected more from an UE5 next gen title. It's crazy how the roach in the beginning of P.T. looks better than the beginning of this trailer lol so crazy how well P.T. graphics hold up all these years later.
Ps5 silent hill art on the console and controller with the game....wishlist so u can have my money
its so beautiful…… its back…. KONAMI is…. BACK!!!!!
Playstation Tenchu 2: Birth of the Stealth Assassins Remake please.
Is this Mulder?
Is this gonna be on ps4 as well?
spread dem cheeks for pyramid
James Sunderland can't catch a break. In his restless dreams he keep seeing that town.  Silent Hill.
Come to PC old friend
Remake parasite eve
Finally some PS5 news. Thank you!
So konami realized that making console games is better than just making mobile phone games?
This morning, I woke up and there were ZERO Silent Hill games coming. After dinner, there are now FOUR Silent Hill games coming. What beautiful madness is this?!
I think Konami just remembered that Silent Hill still exist
Oh the memories...
Its gonna be difficult to improve on the original, but I'll give it a chance. If its not that great, that's okay, I still have the original PS2 disk!
NO EXCLUSIVE?
Love it! Thanks KONAMI.... Now, how about trying metal gear?
Ok enough with the remakes. Just make a new entry ffs
Depois de anos de espera finalmente, esse jogo promete demais!
Se parece más a Sean Bean (Boromir) que a James Sunderland...
YES, A BILLION TIMES YES!!!!!!!!!!
YO WHAT
PS5  with PS4 graphic
Wow
So did they revisit 2 because its more psychological because honestly I really wouldnt mind a remake of 1 and 3. I love their stories but this is really neat too!
Scariest part for me was at the end when it said PS5 exclusive.
Unreal наводит подозрение на вмешательство левых продюсеров.  У японцев своя неторопливость и движки, поэтому и получаются такие классные игры.   Здесь что-то не так..  Надеемся KONAMI не уронят репутацию.
Hope this one doesn’t end inside a pachinko…
Idk Konami is taking its job of ruining video game franchises pretty seriously
Dan risa con sus juegos exclusivos que solo juegas una vez y alv. Me mama como Microsoft se los está jodiendo desde que tienen la mejor consola next gen y hasta el GamePass 😂
Es un excelente juego, ojalá que esté remake sea el inicio de cosas buenas para Silent Hill
Leon ???
After the Resident Evil remakes Konami said, hold my zombie.
CoryxKenshin you better play this when it comes out
Time to boot up the originals on the PS1 and PS2 emulators.
whhy not remake silent hill ?
Now, nexy Metal Gear Solid 1 Remake please!!
WHEN?!???!
slightly concerned about the people making it, not to say the game looks bad, because it doesn't, it looks great, it's just... Bloober is still pretty green all things considered. what is this like their 5th game? but hey, they seem pretty excited to be working on this, so benefit of the doubt.
Janusz Sunderland xD
Sony is going HARD with all of these console exclusives! I hope Microsoft gives me a reason to even turn on my Series X. They need to revive Conkers Bad Fur Day!
Might as well release it on PS4 with those graphics. PS5 is the new PS3
Peak is coming back 👀
Now we are talking
Ps5 exclusive, I guess there is no room for poor people
I would honestly pay full AAA price just to hear the soundtrack alone. I’m so happy Akira is back at the helm of composing Silent Hill
the slight movement on his pal when he touches it, the twitch in his fingers as he slightly touches his face. It is so impressive how far technology has come in terms of computer generated imagery
maybe it's time for Konami and Kojima to get along too
meh
Alv, que chido que le harán remake! Aunque el modelo de James se mira raro y como que más joven
As if this is a PlayStation exclusive :(
When’s the release date?
I'm a happy dude right now ill say that also whoever is gonna play this blind when it comes out, has no idea what they're in for
Seeing as this is a PlayStation console exclusive gives me hope that they’ll be bringing the PS1/2 collection to PS+.
Everyone's talking about Akira Yamaoka coming back, but he's done the soundtrack for all Silent Hill games: even the cash grabs made by western developers after Team Silent was disbanded so it's not really surprising. What I'm really excited about is Masahiro Ito: he did the monster designs for the original games and really helped give Silent Hill its ambience. Because he's so passionate about the original designs, he disliked what Konami has done since as they've often reused Pyramid Head for his popularity (ignoring that it's a part of James).  So for Ito to be back, Konami has really started afresh. It looks promising, and I can't wait to see what Bloober does with it.
Metal Gear Solid Remake? moth3r Fuck3rs...
LET'S GOOOO!!!!!!!!  ONE OF THE COOLEST VIDEOGAME HORROR STORIES OF ALL TIME IS COMING BACK!
FINALY SH2 REMAKE, i wait my ufo ending in this game
Looks nothing like James.
OH OH OHHHHHHHHH
какие же крутые игры выходят на пк🥰🥰🥰🥰
Guess I get to be depressed over Mary’s letter all over again
SILENT HILL ESTA DE VUELTASA LOLLLLLLL, FINALMENTE EL MILAGRO SE DIO. 😭😭😭😭
I will be pre ordering last time I played it was on ps now so glad to see it’s back and renovated
Wow i wasn't specting this it looks amazing Silent Hill 2 is one of my favourite survival Horror games
I’m excited to have more single player games to play, thanks konami !!!!
*Through our sinful martyr's reborn misery and guilt, the world is a more beautiful place, again.*
When can we add to wishlist
HYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYPE!!!  PLEASE add VR mode like Capcom is doing with Resident Evil 7+8!!!!!!!!!!!
The best horror drama game ever!
No way 😮 I’m hyped! 🔥
No theme of Laura? You had 1 job.
Leon in multiverse??
Thank you!
Shiver down my spine... Amazing.. 😍
Pyramid head is back.
Yesss dem nurses!
why is character so ugly?  fire your 3D artist!
what
2:20 THE CLASSIC SILENT HILL THEME
Date prisa Xbox Sony ya salio con sus mamadas de exclusivos
No gameplay, just cut scenes :(
Just a remake? Skip give me Kojima silent hill
I hate the new voice acting. Why don't they use the original voices?
In my restless dreams… I too see that town. Silent Hill.
I’m getting that fo sho.
😍😍😍
This studio sure has a lot in its hands
Finally, a second reason to own a Playstation after Bloodborne.
Whyyyy only ps5
why I still can't get PS5 easily? WHY~~~~~~~~~SONY
Can't wait to get back to the prison section
eww bloober
Hey Silent Hill enjoyers! Which Silent Hill game should I start with if I've never played any of them before?
Ahhhhhhhhg si no tengo la ps5 pero ohhhhhhhhhggggh
That’s 20’s Arthur Morgan and Mary Linton
Não acredito!!!
L + NO KOJIMA?
This alone >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> RE4R, Village and whatever else Crapcom shows tomorrow.
I didn't know this was actually a real game I thought it was a fan-made remake
looks like the resident evil 4 remake
wuuuuuuu NOJODAAAAAAAAAAAA SIIIIIIIIIIIII
can never beat the classic E3 trailer
Here I thought this game would be forgotten
Bueno aqui james si se ve bieeen depresivo. eso le dará mayor empuje a la historia que ya de por si es bien turbia.
ديمم يالشوق لذي اللعبه 😻
I wish Akira san still use Promise and Theme of Laura <3
Everything looks amazing exept for 1 major problem, james looks worse than the original sonic movie. It doesnt even look close to the original character asides from the clothes
Pero que grata sorpresa! Es momento de volver a jugar esta joya en ps2 🥵
merci
Color grading isn't as dark as RE 2 remake or 3 which has all the horror vibes. This feels like an Allan Wake game
Why did they make him look so old and ugly though?
Just when I thought everyone and their mother forgot about this franchise I’m already hyped for this already added it to the wishlist lol
Where’s the dude from death stranding, I’m I missing something here?
Lo voy a gozar como no lo puedes imaginar
i wouldn't get my hopes up, i bet in the last minute konami is going to make it a Pachinko machine with added cut scenes what you see now, look what they did to MGS3
espero que no sea exclusivo el S.H.2
Can we get another metal gear please but actually take your time with it.
Im SO stupid happy about this
Thank you
Oh wow.... I feel really old now.
Never have I beat a Silent Hill or even got  mid way through. I would just give up lol. NOT THIS TIME! 💪
沉默之丘根本不恐怖(我是指電影) 這部當初毀壞了我對恐怖片的印象😮‍💨
My videojuego favorite
I played this game in 2002.  You kids deserve your own Silent Hill.
The Best horror game ever make its great return. Congrats konami
A cockroach? Ew!
3 silent hill games were announced? what!? 😮
Maybe they'll some additional features like adding zombie-like creature with a red crystal on his head.
ooh im coming!!
Please sell it on a CD!!!👏👏👏👏
why does this look fake
I really like how beautiful Mary looks. they did a great job making her look almost ethereal.
I plan to buy it for the nurse.
Me want.
Wow. Just wow. I’m blown away and will be buying this day freaking ONE.
That was unexpected
James looks like a weird mix between the new Leon from Re2 Remake and Murphy from SH Downpour, but i like it lol also please tell me this is only going to be a timed exclussive. Hope it has a similar atmosphere as Shattered Memories because out of the more "modern" SH games that one has without a doubt the best atmosphere.
PlayStation exclusive 😕😓
Unreal Engine 5
For the god's sake I can't believe the best psychological horror ever launched it's coming for playstation. It's like a dream of my life becoming real.
Buuuuuuu exclusive 👎👎👎👎👎 Buuuuuuu
Could it be coming to ps4 to?
Este será el juego por el que comprare mi PS5
He looks a lot like Edward Norton
top
U get a remake and you get a remaster and u get a remake
this is great
KONAMI REDEMPTION ARC
قلتها وارجع اقولها ثاني سايلنت هيل بتقفل ملف رزدينت ايفل وذا ايفل ويذن
Que nostalgia trae consigo este remake
Why not just make a new silent hill, why make the same game we played already, give us something different
I love You so much Akira Yamaoka 😭🙏
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Konami depois de uma década de ter feito último jogo de silent hill: eita poha a gente ainda tem silent hill mano  kkjjk
As someone who's never played or watched this series is this a new one or remake or what?
A remake?
I remember that quote from when I was a kid. It creeped me out then and it creeps me out now. I never even played the game I just watched my uncle play it and I remember that quote: “in my restless dreams….”
Hope this will be on pc if not i dont get how they still have exclusivity they sell even less
2:45 Why is he not wet?
Fijo a que estará censurado. 🔪
Ooooooooooo yees!!
This looks way better than from the stream which was running at a bizarre 24fps.
Konami actually pulled through
Is it a PlayStation exclusive?
Reminds me of the RE 2 remake.
THIS HAS TO BE A DREAM!!!! DON'T PINCH ME IF SO
I can’t believe this masterpiece is back
Why sillent hill 2 and not 1?
This is beautiful, I hope we get the original remake as well
Watch it be a trailer like pt was and never turn into a game lol 😂that would be the biggest troll ever
Maybe there is still hope for PT to become a new silent hill game
PEWDS WILL PLAY THIS GAME!!!
Guess this means I'll have to play the original
I still only hear the original voice actors. Glad it's the same music though.
still no must have new games
The way the cockroach turned at the beginning looked off. 10/10 ign
RIP PT tho
it's happening..
What is wrong with his face xD
Now where's the Silent Hill 1 remake? You can't have a remake of Silent Hill 2 without a remake of Silent Hill 1!
Really wish we could've gotten silent hills still 😪
EXCUSE ME
We need a new Sillent Hill... not a remastered version 🙄
Simplemente  hermoso 😍😍😍
1:20 not Team Silent, but the music is the original people.
You guys do know Konami are gonna ruin this right?
Ooh I saw a 🌽 comic of this game once
Can't wait
Resident evil 4 remake  Silent hill:  hold my beer
I never thought id be able to play a silent hill game now. The best silent hill to date is 2.
Where is one?
Simply one of the greatest games of all time. I hope the remake does it justice
YES! A game that DESERVES a remake
Resident evil better
Do 3 next!
DUDE pyramid head is back babyyyyy
Hoy fue un día feliz:^) Gracias Konami💙
GOOSEBUMPS GOOSEBUMPS GOOSEBUMPS!!!!
HOW CAN YOU SIT THERE AND EAT PIZZA?
"What do you mean the pachinko isn't paying enough? Well, there was that thing we used to do. No, not licensing shows. What was it? Vidje gams I think?
I wish they added the "horn" sound at the end. It would have been more epic!! But yeah, this looks awesome. I'm still waiting for PS5 slim btw QQ
Not that I’m complaining, but…just going straight into Silent Hill 2 and skipping over Silent Hill 1 seems odd. Especially for the newer generations coming into this game/franchise blind. Isn’t that going to be confusing to just suddenly jump into a sequel?   In the overall narrative between the two games, it probably doesn’t matter. But still…at least Capcom went the route of remaking the RE games in a linear fashion that made sense.
The best Silent Hill is here; so happy for the fans. Congratulations to SONY PS5 and Konami for making this.
it doesn't seem like theres gonna be a fixed camera :( also bloober team 😬
Xbox ?
Bruh the reqs on pc....
I guess the Pachenko business isn’t going well? Jokes aside, really excited
Ok, im excited for this, but I really do home they remembered what made silent hill 2 amazing, and while it's just a small thing, I hope it's not indicative of them losing sight.  In the original opening where James looks into the mirror, his eyes were blacked out and he waves his fingers in front of them, because he almost couldn't believe that he wasn't dreaming. It's also somewhat of an indicator that the transformation of silent hill was already underway before he even entered the village. This remade cutscene already got rid of that bit of detail.
For the people who love this series! Happy for you! For everyone else I say, can we please get new games and not remakes! Thanks! :D (Mostly especially on this new console, you know? Like do the remakes later, give us those new titles. I'm all for remakes of games, but it's been remake after remake thus far (more than not).
The only thing more pathetic than the people acting like the name Silent Hill assures quality is how much Konami built up what was actually just another floundering attempt by an AAA company to cash in on the ps2 era. Ya know. Back when these companies put their name on games and not whatever the heck it is the industry has devolved into these days.
YOOOOOOOOOOO
Bien, pero pq hacer el remake SH2 antes que el de SH1?, no lo entiendo.
I'll be buying that ps5 then
why do the ps2 cutscenes still look more realistic than this?
Hope its 60fps
Can’t wait for James to say “this town is full of monsters, how can you just sit there eating pizza!”
FINALY !!!
Me : can we have Leon ? Mom : we have Leon at home  *Leon at home
I'm waiting for the disapointement this is going to be, no game can convince me with a pretty trailer again.
They skipped 1!
They knew they couldn't make an original instead create a remake. I not saying its a bad thing its Just Konami really lost any kind of creativity for a original sequel
YESYESYESYESYES
Konami is finally making games!!!
Look at the recommended specs on Steam. This is gonna be a other 30 fps ps5 game
Finally….
Day one
Never played a silent hill, but I'm sure excited because it reminds me of resident evil a bit.
Brutal...
Even if the game ends up sucking at least we'll have Akira yamaoka music
Hipócritas
Very nice. I thought for a second this will be "Silent hill pachinko 2"
❤
Okay this is the best dream in my life
Still waiting for Silent Hills...
So excited for this. 😈
Can they do a secret dog ending too👀?
Take my money. Faster (We look forward to at least Russian subtitles)
PlayStation exclusive or not?
SH2 Theme of laura is the Best!!!
Never played this game back in the day always wanted to but now it's on 😎
Finally, way to go Konami
I can't believe this is really happening, please Konami don't let this game be another failure of 2022.  Make this remake be the best of the decade, because this game is so important for me, and for a lot of persons.... Make every ending, every place in the city, be so scary as it was in the original game. I need this.... We need this....
Konami remembered Silent Hill now we just need to wait for Metal Gear Rising Revengeance 2
As awesome as it is to see this game remade so beautifully, I don't think I will be looking out for the day it comes out thanks to being on a system that is not very Widely available due to pricing and scaplers.
Wow Konami finally figured out, remaking a classic IP will make money. 🤡
bueno de la saga el 2 es el mejor de todos XD
Launching on December 21st of 2055
Что за убогий облик ГГ... Ну блин(
Oh jeah! I will be sooo happy to buy the same thing again, again! I love the higher fidelity graphics that makes overall everything worse. I can´t wait to explore that way too clean and tonally barely recognizeable town! I´m excited about how that dude in the green jacket looks, sounds and feels nothing like James Sunderland. And I can´t barely hold myself together to be spammed with an overproportional amount of Pyramid Head and jumpscares.  Oh, and I´m sooo eager to get my next DMCA strike from Konami. I hope it will be the trainwreck that this teaser makes it look like.
AINT NO WAY
In the end it was this "abandoned".
Wow this place is very beautiful, I enjoy watching
Turn back! A dog is controlling it all!
I'm finally going to play this game
They should remake the silent 1 too
DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THE STEAM DECK CAN HANDLE THE NEW SILENT HILL 2 GAME????  I just bought one and I’m not the most tech savvy. If anyone reads this and can compare the specs to the steam deck and the game requirements for pc, I would be super appreciative. Thank you.
Why , have to show that roach a** at the beginning  ?
Hoy Dios bajo del cielo.
When dad finally comes home from the gas station with the milk he promised you
Garbage... Massive L!
Fire finally what I always wanted to come back
This looks great!! Seems like it'll be a faithful remake.
QUIEEE
I'll keep my expectations low due to bloober team making it.
This is great if only we could get the silent hill pt game
Que gráfico lindo da porra
This brings back time
FOX engine?
Now remake 4 as well!! Ugh!
Konami, thank you.
silent hill 1? never heard of it
😍😍😍
I am so excited for this!!! But can we at least get Silent Hill 1 on PS premium with trophies 🏆?
Anyone know the song at 2:29
Exclusive to PS3 😂
So where's kojima?
Looks interesting
Our prayers have been answered
Another 30 FPS title 😂
Too bad it's only for PS5 ;-;
They really need to make a series starting Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as James Sunderland.
Silent hill is the red headed step child that never gets in trouble, brings home straight A's and still gets left out on xmas
Господи,  я ждал этого так долго...
What does this guy remind me of Leon Kennedy from resident evil
Why for PS5? Not everybody have PS5
Buenisimo!!!!!! Al fin!
YOOOOOOOOO
🧡
I didn't know PS3 had Silent Hill 2 to now has a remaster in PS5..... Or this is an indie fan remake?     Yes, I was ironic.
holy fuxk
And, silent hill 1...
The graphics look insane
I'm so happy Silent hill returned (i only played 2 Silent Hill games: Origins and 4...the rest....i just watched on walkthrough), can't wait to this one soon.
This looks amazing! But seriously, when's the pachinko machine version coming out??
Something just feels....missing....
This is a fckiiiing dreeamm come truee
Do my ears deceive me or are they using the original voice recordings from the original game? The way she says”Silent Hill…. That little town” in the same tone and inflection but it cuts off right before “or special place” gave me chills. Might just have to buy a PS5 to play this.
Release date: 2025 🙄😒😒😒😒
Xbox
I still don't trust Konami, not after how they've been the past decade.
ВЫШЕЛ ВЫШЕЛ!!!
Wow! Lots of cool horror games coming out. But no Norman Reedus?
1:55 MgsV Sound ? When you meet the skulls or when it’s night ? That sound effect is so similar
Soy de ps4 estoy triste :(
I hope the bring it to ps4
im so excited, the music in this trailer alone is fantastic
The one where he does nothing but run and jump in holes and sees things that look important but he won't pick it up because Mary.  This one? Ok
This is gonna be dope on the X!
Looks like Konami is pulling a Capcom and remaking silent hill 2. I didn't say it was a bad thing
I wish that somebody would do the same justice for the resistance games
su cara porque se ve asi
James kind of looks weird though
Can defs tell that Konami cares about this project, definitely not because there’s a precedent for old horror game remakes doing well, definitely not definitely not definitely not  Great idea to have the creators of the least subtle horror game The Medium (whose ending had the moral of "it's better to kill yourself than to have your trauma affect other people"), remaking one of the most subtle horror games ever
is there a silent hill in the same? sorry im new here
Passei mal agora, meu deus Konami
Omfg so hyped i’m running to get a ps5 rn
204863
And you cry for Call of Duty...
Without Kojima ? Cmon :D not gonna make it   But ! For you guys, big fans, Im happy for you
Gods that transmission showcase was excellent not just one, but 4 Silent Hill games. Really enjoyed how each team talked about how much SH meant to them and were consulting with original devs where available to capture its spirit.
Now if only I could get a PS5...  Update... I got a ps5
wheres the theme song..
Never thought I'd actually see silent hill revived.. also pyramid head's the 🐐
Welcome back Konami , welcome back silent hill 2 , It's been a long time  There is nothing better than Japanese horror
Come on, Bloober! Make Team Silent proud!  Also, I wonder what their versions of Theme of Laura and Promise will sound like, assuming they made it into the game...
Those visuals are insane. It looks like they might be using some ray tracing too. Seems like it when that door opened in the beginning and you could see the light bouncing off the door and coloring the wall. Must be a GI based system unless it's using UE5's Lumen
finally not a pachinko machine
When konami?
This is straight up the best news many of us have had in years.
Why not just remake Silent Hill?
James: Mary it's me! Mary: What took you so long? Mary: Tell me, tell that words. I need to hear one more time... James: Kept you waiting, huh? Mary: Ok, no way! No more Metal Gear games when we arrive at home.
Exclusivo de ps5? Hum, interessante.
And this is Exclusive for PS5 hahahaha Yeaaah Take That Xbox in your face!!! So happy please BUY KONAMI GOAHEAD
SH is an iconic game, it’s a shame that never got a remake. But we are here now let’s enjoy folks.
Alguien sabe si lo sacaran tmb para el ps4?...
(Edited for clarity!) My only worry is that Blooper Team has kind of messed up endings for some of their own games.. too many of them have a message that those hurt by trauma are a burden, which is very much so NOT a message in Silent Hill!
James sounds like Seth Green when he had a sore throat.
Why fog something? In the original, there was snow, not fog. Почему туман-то? В оригинале снег был, а не туман.
Wow didn’t expect that. I was absolutely sure that Konami won’t existed anymore in 2023.
I hope we still get P.T one day.. or chapter 51 for mgsv. But hyped up for silent hill 2 !
Bloober
Day 1 Cant wait for this.
Vou deixar o pessoal jogar a versão beta no PlayStation  Ano que vem eu jogo a versão definitiva, no console mais poderoso do mundo, e de graça no Gamepass 😎
I don't wanna sound ingrateful, i really happy that the series is making a comeback. Of all 4 main games of the series made by Team Silent, SH 1 is the one who really need the remake more, not saying that 2, 3 and 4 dont deserve one too, but i think is because 2 was the most memorable and succesfull game of the franchise. Hope the game became a critical succes and break sales records, so we see the other three and more games for the future. Still Happy for the remake though!!!
Winter is the best time of horror
I really hope I can play this game  I even wanted to replay the original game to enjoy when it comes out
I really wish the best to anyone involved in this project even with all the negativity behind the studio. Stay positive people!
KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS 🙏😭🙌
is it so hard? really is it? Give the people what they want its that simple. Thank you EDIT: only ps5 sort of annoys me
I almost cried.
Leon?
Well that’s an easy skip lol
I'm utterly overwhelmed. One of the greatest gaming experiences I ever had way back in the PS2 heyday
Septiembre 24, 2001 never say never. For you players.🕹️👊🏼😉
I will Miss video games once the world ends
I see it says unreal but which engine?
This game is trash asf
Thought I can finally afford a version of Silent Hill 2 but I still need a PS5 🤡
Awesome, now we need Alone in the dark
WOW . AFTER LONG TIME NOT SEEING PYRAMID HEAD . JUST WOW !!!
A huge W for the Silent Hill fan base... congratulations: we can finally take our clown make up off.
Playstation: Silent Hill 2   Me: WHATT??  Grabs video tape  Puts tape back in  Me: :WHATTT?:
So it's "PS5 Demon's Souls" :/
FULL CIRCLE BAYBEE WOOHOO
I may have never played the games, but as a fan of the legacy with this series, I look forward to this. hopefully, they do it justice just like how Capcom did with Resident Evil 2 Remake
Thank you so much
Yes please 😭😭😭
THEY WHAT
PS5 RLY?? SOKAFOKWDSOKGKOER-IUY 9-IY459I8I
que coisa linda!!’
Gotta say I'm loving James's  new voice actor. I can feel the pain and anguish in his voice.
FINALLLLLLYYY is all I can say
Never thought Leon would be in silent hill 😅
Finally
Is it a ps5 exclusive?
My money gonna explode next year
This looks amazing! 😮😮😮
I'm going in with caution, but I am so glad Silent Hill has a pulse again. I just hope it's a glorious revival and not a grasp of desperation.  This looks well done and I am looking forward to see more!
I can’t believe this is real. I’ve waited so long. Thank you Konami
I cried
Pachinko exclusive 😲😂
So that I’m clear this is a remake right?
In my restless dreams, I see that game. Silent Hill.
No james, she is in your car
Cool
Leon is that you ?
They better not cancel this
Looks interesting
Finalmente, obrigado por voltarem com essa incrível franquia.
🔥
Xbox chora com o Forzinha e Halo
Already in this its a no cuz the pt got me like this should be different  however  let me open myself to this cuz after this long all the ducks should have been lined up
It looks amazing!!!!!!
Let's get it Konami!
oh boy team blooper...............................
Yup count me in
マジでやるのか、KONAMI……。 小島秀夫を失ったKONAMIが、どこまでやれるのか……というか、それよりもジェイムスの顔が圧倒的に内村光良なんだが！？(笑) ジェイムスって、もっとハンサムな設定だったのでは！？（あ、いや、ウッチャンはハンサムなんだけどねｗ）
Чет как то не очень, трейлер на троечку
I see that town..
l
Can’t believe the day has actually come
sh1 deserved a remake...you know... a PS1 exclusive?
Please Please redesign James 😭😭
aye the guy in DBD
Looks like old man Leon S Kennedy
i'm so excited to play it again
Whattt!!??
YES! FINALLY
I can already hear all the twenty people fan remaking this game screeching
hmmm I dunno
CON CHE TU MARE !  🖤
You only have one life and have half to pay for different slots
This is the game over level 90 for eyes. I think this time we might be able to fight more than hide and maybe all of the extra endings are here should be intresting. If the game does well we could get the proper sequal we all wanted from PS3.
Is this like a 5 nights at Freddy's spinoff?
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Is Guy Cihi back?
Leon Kennedy looking a little different...
I've never played any of the Silent Hill game and to be honest this looks promising but I'm going to be cautiously excited about this as well as Silent Hill F.
Watch a non Japanese dev completely wiff the tone and subtlety of the original
Seria foda se tivesse feito o primeiro jogo, segundo não acho nada demais, puro puxa saquismo, é uma pena 😢
NOW GIVE ME SILENT HILL ORIGINS
okay now this is epic
Holy holy yessssss
KONAMI WHAT??????????
Ебать надо покупать пс5
The hypocrisy is real here.
It's amazing es lo máximo é óptimo!!
MAKE A NEW ONE PLEASE 🥺
YESSSSSS
Sooo… Silent HillZ?
Creative bankruptcy
Over the shoulder camera, huh? Yeah, nevermind.
I mean...PT woulda been better but I'm still happy with this
I hope there's a weird controversy over male genitalia mutilation from this.
I wanna play this bad
aduuuuuuuuuuu
Release date?
Where silent hill 1?
YES!!!!! FINALLY!!
¡Madre santa!
It is official?
I don't know if I'm happy for the comeback of the game or worried about the nightmares I'm gonna have after playing it💀
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
"In my restless dreams, I see that town... Silent Hill..."
About time, now can we get metal gear 1,2, and 3 remakes?
will it rise or will it fail...?
👏👏
Where is Maria?
When?
It's crazy how entire companies can continue to exist off of nostalgia alone, truly the most powerful addiction in existence.
I have bad feeling about this idk I hope they don't ruin it
I’m readyyyyy
Welcome to Silent Hill..... 😃
Welcome back old friend
Hideo Kojima
Konami found their bootleg madds mikkelsen for the role.. if kojima were still in the team he would have been perfect for the role.
Te extrañe tanto...
The Medium was basically a silent hill game so I have high hopes for bloober
Super
Not expected but needed!! welcome back silent hill franchise
Always was a big Resident Evil fan back in the day, never tried out Silent Hill, can't wait for this.  Now all Konami needs to do now is a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3🤘
Yoooooo
The One Piece IS real!
As someone who never experienced the silent hill games and only way available was that awful HD collection. I am very excited to get a true taste of the silent hill franchise.
No se olviden de the suffering 💖💖✨✨ JUEGAZO.
James the asiatic Sunderland
“I stole your wallet im waiting for you in our special place.. no James, not Vegas”
Не похож, но всё остальное отлично)
Silent Hill 2 is one of my all time favourite games. Not gonna let myself get too excited just yet though. Don't forget that Konami have already made a HD remaster for SH2 & SH 3 on the Xbox 360 and PS3. Those games were, by all accounts, worse than the original titles released on the PS2.
FINALLY FINALLY FINALLY
Wow what an epic looking pachinko game
Oh gee.
A new pachinko game 🎉🎉🎉🎉
bruh i got goosebumps' for real
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩Bien
👏🏽 ❤
Zzzzzzzz
Это божественно, сайлент хилл вернëтся к истокам.
The Hill is officially Silent again.
Little sad the voicework seems more competent. Hopefully they don't lean into a mellowdramatic tone. James always came off as detached from everything in his grief.
Legend is back ,Akira Yamoaka ❤
I got chills seeing pyramid head
Tell me im not dreaming please
Tum bhencho game hi release karte rehna...ps 5 ka toh stock le aao saloo
Omfg
konami comes back?
is this gonna be playstation exclusive
lit
IM FUUUUUCCCCCCCCCIN HAAAAAPPPY MY HHEEEAAARRTT BRRRRUUHHH
I can hardly believe it. After all this time!! I initially thought this was a remaster, which I was also excited about (even though we got one for the PS3 which, admittedly, had a rough go) - then I saw that this is A WHOLE REMAKE. I'm a bit speechless. I'm so excited!!!!
jugue todos los silent hill excepto este, ahora solo me falta robar una ps5 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well, looks like I'm going to have to get a PS5 now
Aren't you...Maria?
Parece de las películas piratas con mal cgi :|
0:45 MGSV flashbacks Now do yo remember?
This brings me back wow
Hermoso 😭
Mano senti uma leve aparência com Leon de residente evil! Mas alguém?
У конами деньги кончились и они решились выпустить ремейк Сайлент Хил 2?
Leon
Don't dissapoint us Konami, this is looking fantastic, this is yours chance of redemption
Yes! The famous pyramid head r*pe scene
Dude where is pc version
The play station exclusive hit deep into my soul. I know is for a year but common man ! :(
noice
nasi
❤
how is it possible for the character fmv animations to look 100x better 20 plus years ago than it does now
we don't need ray taced cockroaches
This game will be epic
Yes yes yes yes !!!!!!
I'm conflicted because the trailer was honestly edited pretty dogsh*t, so I don't want to assume the worst of this game based on the trailer alone. Here's to hoping.
If only Hideo Kojima was a part of this. I will definitely play this game
We'll see what it's like when it comes out.
PS + remake ->🖕
Suikoden, and now Silent Hill. Konami finally get their $hit together.
What did I do to Deserve a remake of my favorite game?! :0 I'm really hoping it's gonna go off in terms of horror
I really hope the SH2 intro is in the game. They could've just shown that lol. (I just love Theme of Laura cause it captures the tone of the game honestly.)  "Aren't you Maria...?"
I‘m glad that they kept James‘ look as a broken, haggard-looking man. Heck, I think he looks even more pathetic here than in the original, which compliments his character well.
Looks amazing.
What a time to be alive
Bloober team??? Pero que no son los del pésimo juego de The medium??? 0 expectativas.
...i bet i know how it ends
HWTJIWJWNE8WIANSJFJDJD D SDUDLKDUAJAJFJDH AHHHHHHH SILENT HILLL AUFHAHRBRIGUUG
Nice to see Leon here
Can't wait to see how Konami screws this one up, ready to pay for save slots or some other dumb micro transactions hellscape they've cooked up.
Yes yes yes
Otro perro remake? como siempre los japoneses lucrando con la nostalgia de los fanaticos, lo unico rescatable es la presencia de Akira Yamaoka
Esta es de esas franquicias donde tenía que robar unos pesos si o si con los remakes
It’s not silent hills But I still can’t wait
Konami lutando para se salvar da falência.
No puedo creerlo después de tantos años pensé que nunca regresaría Silent Hill
Thank you Konami. Hopefully there's another Castlevania game in the near future. ✌😎👍
Ninguém quer um remake ou remaster... a gente quer um jogo novo
After what they did to my boy Hideo Kojima, and to all of their employees. I will never support Konami ever again. Greedy company that doesn’t care about their employees. So konami, y’all can go eff your self.
Pra quem é fã, um prato cheio.  Aí sim Sony. 😄
Someone showed this year's ago and never thought that they would push it out now
Young Harrison Ford kicks the s*** out of nurses, like it
Okay this is genius like what Capcom did with the Resident Evil remakes but why didn't they start with 1??? 🤦‍♂️
I've watched this trailer a hundred times already, I cannot wait!
Does this mean Konami will care about Metal Gear Solid again??
Legend of the Dragoon remake when?
Everybody thanks Kojima for showing Konami that great game sales.
Can't tell if this looks great, or like a fan made trailer?!
I just hope this is not an Indie studio, never heard of it before
I wish ps4 games
Una pena que no saquen el 1, no verán ni un euro mio
JFC FINALLY
well, I think it's time to sell a kidney, to buy the play 5.
we are so fvcking bvck
Leon?
im not crying
Estoy llorando.   Gracias PlayStation.  Silent Hill 2.
And its not cross gen guys...
PS5 la menor opción ❤️
Wow wow wow!!!
The best scilent hill
Is it gonna be on PSVR 2 now I don’t want wishlist when the pre order?
You finally came.
Pyramid head F yea!
Please bring back a new SH game but Kojima in charge
PTM nome jodaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaassssss
Night Nurses
Seria pedir demais vir dublado????
No estará para PS4 ?😔
Uhm the pyramid man is not daddy enough 💅🏾
Wow
Please keep the music Promise Reprise!
So next year we get a Metal Gear Solid remake right?
Childhood nightmares are back
So pumped
Nope, just... Nope...
This is Konami’s only chance at redemption!
Too much flash and video game polish actually makes this look a bit worse than the original.
I admittedly have never touched a Silent Hill game in my life, Though now I'm intrigued
KONAMI?? ARE YOU ALRIGHT???
estoy soñando cierto
1:27 man didn't seem too fazed.
Akira Yamaoka's music is one of the big reasons why I love the franchise. So glad he's back too.
I didn't see any game play.... Let's hope it's not a new PS5 pachinko game
this looks terrible. The Medium was like a bad Silent Hill inspired game that understood nothing about what made SH2 terrifying. This is an insult to one of the greatest games ever made
Выглядит охуенно. У меня только претензия к лицу Джеймса, оно выглядит так, будто ему в утреннею кашу насрали. Я конечно понимаю, что оно и должно быть не радостным, но тут такое ощущение что Джеймса специально в город загнали, хотя в игре это его осознанный выбор и его главный страх это не монстры.
This we are buy
i remember playing this back in dreamcast days. i just rewatched the movie and it was amazing. why the FFFFFFFFFF does it have bad ratings. who rates things?
Quien diría que konami le enseñaria que es un remake de verdad a progue dog madre santa solo espero que se respete la calidad  y el amor que se le dio en su día al mejor juego de terror de la HISTORIA.
Damnit I guess I may have to buy a PS5 now…
Here Sony is paying for exclusives (albeit temporarily) while simultaneously complaining about Microsoft potentially getting exclusives. 😬  I say this, fully acknowledging that this project likely would not have happened without Sony's financial incentives.
A remake.... how sad is the slow cancellation of the future
I should be excited, but I'm not. I'll wait to see how it turns out, but I have nearly no faith in Konami when it comes to their games. Look at the joke of a Silent hill collection that came out back on PS3, or the new Contra that came out a few years back, look at how they destroyed the Metal Gear series. The most we get outta them nowadays is classic collections of old games and honestly, that's the treatment the Silent Hill series should get, with a little more effort this time around.
Where’s Norman reddus
p.t ser revivido era esperar demais mesmo
Yes baby thank u live u so much please remake number 3 and bring back sexzy beam shooter and the light saber with more gore
no lo puedo creer despues de tanto años de espera... se me caen las lagrimas
With this i expect remakes of all the games and a new one
Dude!!!
Do you want nightmares? This is how you get nightmares.
wow another remake ........... Not going to buy give the IP to Hideo so he and norman reedus and junji ito can show us what a horror game is. All the Horror games up to this day are boring not a single one in the last 10 years that was scary beside Resident Evil 7 im not counting re 2 and 3 because its also just remakes. Played them all Layers of fear phasmo outlast etc etc
Absent de la ps4…
did the people in konami start sobering up?
MGS Confirmed!!!!!
So they bypassed 1🤣 and decided mindlessly to make a remake for part 2🤣 makes sense
Wait... is that real?
😯😯😯
SILENT HILL INU IS THIER CRYPTO?b
So happy to see it's also available on PC.
Haunting, dreadful, eerie.. Truly what to expect from an SH game. Hope it can even surpass the original.
Aún me duele lo del p.t pero ojalá lo hagan bien con este.
Never thought the day would come. Back into the depths of silent hill we shall go again!!
ALL OF THE YES
Graphics look spectacular. I feel like part of the creepiness of the older games was with the less detailed visuals, but I'm sure they'll figure something out. The music will be on point. I liked the voices of the original game more, but these ones definitely sound more expressive. The only thing I don't really like as much is how they made the cutscenes. James' bathroom cutscene is iconic, and it's weird being able to look at his eyes. Overall kind of exited.
HOLYSHITITSHAPPENING!!!!!!!!!!
Esto es grande, esto es hermoso, me vengooo
Playstation home of remakes Xbox home of plenty of decent exclusives
FINALLYYYYY!!!
Oh look! It’s Leon Kennedy brother !
Premium version coming soon to Xbox Series X 😁
Que extraño que hagan eñ remake del 2 en lugar de el primer juego, no me quejo pero yo pensaría que harían remake del 1 y después se 2.
in my restless dream silent hill
Este pequeño momento de mi vida se llama Felicidad 👍
FYK
so is this going to be a ps5 exclusive?  if so, this might be the game to finally get a ps5.
Ваааааау! Шикарно!!! Очень жду! )))
Console exclusive? On Unreal? Booooooo
Ps4 owners will cry like me
yes finally ive been waiting for this!!!!
I am very scared  scared of how bad this remake could end up being if they don't basically just do a demon's souls remake
I'm waiting for a Remake of MGS1, 2 and 3
Finally!!!!!!!
💖💖💖💖💖
PT 2 also would be sick
unbelievably excited. I really hope Mr. Yamoaka can breathe life into this game with his compositions. been waiting sooo long for this.
about ficking time
Next should be SH 4 The Room. I want a remix for that!
Finally this is getting serious
Am I the only one who thinks a Silent Hill series could do well in this market?
Let me guess Pyramid Head now follows you trying to kill you for most of the game
Leon, you look older from RE2 2019
that pachinko is 🔥🔥
Play buy Konami please
Please, no comic sans and missing fog like last time lol. Guess the other big question is about the OG cast...looks great! Used the letter narration as an opening title fly in college project!
This happened to my buddy eric
You all know Konami lost the source code and only has an unfinished mess to use as a base? Plus bloober team are some of the worst developers. Do you really think bloober are going to take the unfinished code, finish it to a satisfactory point and make a authentic remake of this masterpiece?  I wish I could be excited, I really do, but this is going to be a trainwreck.
Un motivo mas para ser feliz
Where's Silent Hill 1 ?
Everyone on Xbox is in suicide watch.
Wait, Konami? The pachinko company? Well color me surprised.
Considering how Konami has been recently, I am very cautiously optimistic.
This and alan wake 2 gonna be great
The graphics are INSANE 👀👀😳😳👏👏🔥🔥💥💥
3:08 "Playstation console exclusive" i was having a heath attack. until i saw the "also available on pc"
Well Capcom,...it's on now!
Poca madre la pinche exclusividad
Is this a remaster of the 2nd game?
So another remake well we aren’t  backrupt on ideas I guess it’s better than getting trash sequel’s
Copy /paste P:T:
Sony out here pushing the limits for this generation of console in terms of graphical fidelity and performance, meanwhile Microsoft can't even get 343 industries to fix Halo Infinite 💀
Uhull 😍😍👏👏
Silent hill 2 is my favorite horror game. This brought flashbacks.
This IP is sitting on $$ KONAMI either troll the fan for holding for this long just to make us thirsty and hype but hey they can now say "Keep you waiting huh."
SH1
THEY FINALLY HAD THE COMMON SENSE TO DO IT BOYS
Only took 20 plus year's
Peak
Why cant we get a remaster/remake of the original, they've already hd 2 n 3 for ps3.
Solo para PS5, que mamada wey pinche Konami
You screwed us with silent hills. Now you want me to buy this game. Bring silent hills back. Then I will buy this
That beginning really had me hopeful it was PT commin back
this is real? i'm not sleeping?
Silent hill 2? Not silent hill 1?
BEST SH GAMES EVER
Amazing, I never thought I would see another Silent Hill game and even better, they are redoing one of my favourite games in the series!
リメイク版のキャラクターモデリングの好みは置いておくとしても、モーションのぎこちなさから2流感が漂ってるけど…大丈夫そう？
Wish it could’ve just been a reboot instead of a remake of 2. I’ll take what I can get I suppose…
🙏🙂
Leon?!
james looks like a blond murphy now
I want Silent Hill 1
Why Remake 2 and skip 1? :(
I have never played any of the Silent hill games so can anyone explain me why is so special? I don't see anything interesting in this trailer! Maybe because i'm not familiar with the Silent Hill and i'm not hyped in any sense by this trailer. Someone to explain me why is all that fuzz about?
THAT GAME THAT EVERY BODY BEEN WAITING FOR LOLOL
Я в шоке
Ok I know it’s a remake but 🥹 I’ll still play it
Нихуя себе
Ta muito foda!!!
Yeeeesssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!
finally. FINALLY. silent hill!!! YES. this trailor seems too elaborate to be a pachinko machine. so does that mean..... ... silent hill? SILENT JHILL YEAHHHSA"£!¬¬
one of the games that mode console gaming thrive. glad to be alive and see SH back
Could this be remake that stays honest to original?
I'm crying
Por lo que me complace ver, tendremos detalles como el inicio con James desde los exteriores de Silent Hill y el Lago Toluca, tendremos juego dentro de los departamentos de Wood Side, estaran los monstruos clasicos, el Hospital Brookheaven, a Laura, la Sociedad Historica de Silent Hill, el parque Rosewater, a Maria y en enfrentamiento con los dos Piramid Head. Sin Masahiro Ito como padre creador de las creaturas y Akira Yamaoka como genio creador de la banda sonora de toda la saga, no seria Silent Hill 2.
BAHAHAHAHAHAHA
this is japan
🤘✨
So, Bloober Team instead of Japan Studio... Sure, a SH walking simulator sounds like a great idea
Thought the intro was pt . Gave me ptsd 😅
AAAAAAAAA AMOOO
>blooper team  Dropped.
Cuando salga lo jugaré completo en youtube
Now where is Silent Hills?
I’m moist.
Yeeeeesssssss! Thank you!
Alan wake
YOOO
Where was Eddie 😔
I'm not complaining one bit, but why would they begin the remake process with SH 2? Why not start from the beginning with SH 1?
Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Silent Hill 2 on the Remakestaion 5 love it!
Looking forward to this remake. I wasn't a fan of the direction Silent Hills was starting to take at the time. Hope this one does the original justice
need a PS5 now
Wow. Konami's new pachinko machine looks great!
Nitro Rad?
I can't wait for this to NOT come out!
This is EXACTLY what we've all been waiting for..
👍👍👍👍👍
Silent Hill 1 REMAKE por favor
no lo puedo creer, pense que nunca volveria a salir un juego de silent hill
Где мой Норман Ридус, Где мой Кодзима?
Why did I not know about his?
Usually I would be very happy if just for cheap nostalgia sake, however I just don't see today's PlayStation being faithful to the subtle sexual themes of the original. Let's see what happens, but I'll keep my hopes low.
🤩😱
Yessssssssss..!
Aaaaaa sensacional
Have to wait for the release to see if Konami has redeemed themselves
But why they used almost similar model to Kennedy from RE
Virgin Mary is the evil one.
this is cool and all  but I still can't forgive you guys for cancelling PT. :(
No da miedo el tráiler parece más como si quisieran joder con la nostalgia de las entregas anteriores con esa música y sentimentalismo
"WISHLIST NOW".... Heh....
F for PS4 users😪😪😪
bloober team they my favorite games going be epic
Keren
WWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I don't really know how to feel. My initial reaction was jubilation, but Konami has burned us too many times.
The trailer for the new casino machine looks great!
Thank you bro saved this year fr needed some new survival horror I’m my life
No me gusta
Been waiting a long long time for this
Something’s missing..
About time but why didn’t they start with silent hill 1? Capcom set the blueprint
And parasite eve?
hey Konami, now release an MGS4 remaster if you want me to buy a PS5 so I can play SH2 also.
WANT!!! All dog endings and super green spray must be included
im 20 now and will finally be able to enjoy this the same way my cousin did when he was my age
They should’ve made the main character a girl like in the movies
they should do 3 too
IN MY RESTLESS DREAMS I SEE THAT TOWN... SILENT HILL
So……..is PT coming back?
Sheryl!... SHERYL!
F for Xbox
could this be Konami's shot at a redemption?
its real? I can't believe
Too bad Kojima and Guillermo del Toro won't be here for this
Remember P.T?
Is this real please tell me Im Not dreaming silent hill is finally coming back!!!!!
Is this coming to Xbox?
This one gonna be a 80% off on the price tag price.
Don't want 2 remake , just want to start new beginning
Next DLC : Pyramid Head using Cloud Strife costume 😂
I hope this comes to pc
KOJIMA DOES IT AGAIN
Why would you make part 2 before 1 ?
I never played a silent hill game so i think I’ll pick this up
Great! Now do Metal Gear Solid!
How can they improve the graphics but completely lose the gritty atmosphere and lighting that made the original title stand out?
After the whole pt incident I'mma need more to go off before I fall for this project 😂
KEANU RIEVEES?
So finally Konami remembered they have a huge Horror game IP aside their pachinko and medicine utilities...
Wasn't this game on PC before?
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY PLEASE KKSDJKJDFHKJSHDFKHkDKSFHKHDSK
Komami is making a comeback!!
touching game masterpieces such as this is blasphemous no words. what a terrible day
Literal estoy trabajando y grite de emocion  simplemente no se que decir ni si quiera siento que es real (llora*) estoy muy feliz por esta noticia y enserio espero mucho de este juegazo pero si es verdad que tambien hay mucha presion por hacerla aun mejor que la obra original y todo eso en verdad espero que puedan mantener esa esencia que tenia el juego original y que podamos disfrutar de este juegazo en serio estoy muy feliz con el simple hecho dever esta noticia..
Un metal gear solid 1 vamos Konami yo te doy mi dinero si lo haces realidad
Metal Gear Next???
yeah yeah yeah SH2 is awesome, but, can i get a Metal Gear Solid 3 remake?
Why won't they remaster Metal Gear Solid!?
thank you KONAMI😭thank you SONY😭😭
No chance for a PC port I assume?
This has a lot to live up to, I hope they do it justice.
Soul Reaver Pls
Another Playstation &^%*ing exclusive! Jerks!
This looks amazing
CRYING AND SCREAMING
If it's not for ps4 I'm not buying. I refuse to buy a glorified ps4 for double the price. There is simply no justifying it. The ps5 is not a significant step up in technology like the previous playstation systems.
the voice and sight of a broken man... with today graphics... I ´ve waiting too long but its finally here
where are my fellow haters in the chat. sh2 didn't need a remake and this looks like a soulless cash grab
This game is so overrated
Kojima??
BUT WHY BLOOPER
I know it's being outsourced, but I still don't trust konami.
konami making games again?
that's what i'm talking about that's why he's the MVP that's why he's the GOAT the GOAT
Gaming over the past few years has been hit or miss…..however, stuff like this is what brings back my love for gaming that I had as a young child
As I live and breathe!
It's been over 20 years since this game was made
0:55  ctmmmmmmmm
É real É real porrrraaa é reallllll pulllllllll
the mirror scene is ruined
Hands down the best psychological horror game ever made. I can't wait to play this
YESSSSSSS
How about silent hill 1?
Never finished silent 2 this looks great day one purchase for sure
My brain can't believe this is happening, im still processing the whole thing, im really curious about the the dog and OVNI ending.
Sony serious monopoly
Can someone give me a brief summary what Silent Hill is about without spoiling too much
I'm so happy it's back man...this was a huge part of my childhood
where is sharon and Rose😢
Impresionante
no actual gameplay was shown. I'd remain skeptical for now. Konami can f...k this up big time, as they often do
zomgzomgzomgzomgzomg
nice to see pyramid head still getting down on the mannequins 20 years later
Finally Konami grew a pair...
Most Scary Game Ever 👍🏻
rumors were true
Доброе утро дальневосточным Привет азиатам Привет европейцам Кто что думает по поводу ремейка и анонсу SH f?
Last time this game got remade it didn't go so well...
If PS is marketing it it better not be trash. Looking forward to this, The Forest 2, and RE4.
I should be happy, I WANT to be happy, SH2 left a massive impact on me as a kid.  And yet all I can think about is how absolutely wrong this can - and likely will - go.  I hope they prove me wrong.
Espero q no sea exclusivo de ps5 por q si no vaya desperdicio
This is long overdue, and I am thrilled for legit everyone from the people making to the people waiting for it. Bravo.
Cant wait for the remade dog ending 😲
is..is..is this finally happening? 🥺🥺😦❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Is this a remake?... or a new installment?... its great theyre reviving this franchise... we need more games like this..
The bitterness for how Konami treated people like Kojima and Hayter notwithstanding; this hopefully signals a strong move by the company to grow beyond pettiness and pachinko.
So this never released on ps4?
wake up darling, silent hill is back
Bad music, bad voice acting, mediocre last gen graphics, crappy animatorską. This is going to be a marvelous dissapointment
I can't believe this is happening.
As someone who grew up with silent hill series and enjoyed it far more than resident evil I’m so very happy to see this and will for sure be purchasing this day one!!
Another remake 🤦
Wait  , is Playstation buying Konami or funding this?
Graphics are gorgeous but disappointed with the shot choices and camera angles etc. I loved the dynamic floating camera in the original. I hope they don’t lose that too much, or else it will just feel like an RE-remake clone with SH skin to me. I don’t want to complain because I love the series but it’s just not team silent (sheds tear)… I’ll also elect to play this in 30fps probably for a more cinematic feel. Definitely not the modern perspective, but for SH, it feels unnatural to me without it.
Leon, you're in the wrong game!
Is this a joke?
Looks sick
Chills all around chills rn
Xavier Wulf - Thunder Man
I'm crying rn, I so freakin happy silent hill is (possibly) making a come back! I just hope they don't ruin it tho
I've never played Silent Hill, this teaser has caught my interest though
Would have been more excited if it were being developed by Japanese developers......  Blah...👎🏾
SH2 today, PT tomorrow
1 is The Best.
I swear I can't stress this enough:  Pyramid Head is OVERRATED.  Also, I can't wait to play this and I hope they remake 1, 3, and 4 🔥
I've never played silent Hill  I've been playing video games since atari
About time
PT :(
So glad Leon got another game
Finally...
Почему лица – кринге!?
Finally, we came back to Silent hill.
Oh hey it’s Silent Hill
So glad Leon got another game
I played 2 on the ps2 a couple months ago. I really liked it but didnt and thus only got 3 hours into it. It felt way to old and i was not mentally prepared for the backtracking, puzzle solving and etc that early 2000s games had. With this i can finally enjoy this gem.
No way!! Another cash grab remake, I'm so excited!
Not Bloober Studio 🥱
el único juego por el cual me comprace el play 5 pero creo q una año mas no es tanta la espera
It’s beautiful
**## GRITO ESTREPITOSO DE FAN GIRL ##***
Hopefully playable on steam 🧐
Bloober team hasn't made a single game worthy of praise. This is very disappointing. Gonna be a bad game.
is this the one with the dog?
El REGRESO DE LA LEYENDA VAMOOOOOOOS
every company needs to start using unreal engine 5
Coisa linda de trailler uhuhu
I'm not getting my hopes up they just gonna cancel this too
Cries in PT 😩😞
The legend come back
the graphics look nice. Unreal engine 5 is the real deal
Thanks for the flash bang!
So P.T.?
y'all want INSANE hype? Just make P.T. available on the playstation store again and everybody will be hooked instantly please make P.T. available again, it's one of the best horror experiences ever, and yall will get infinitely better sales
Why they dont call this remake ?
Is this a remake or new?
This is awesome, now i dont have to pay 200 bucks to play this game
😳 this is awesome. Now we need some Metal Gear.
Sony convinced Konami that the PS5 is a Pachinko machine, sneaky.
"Mary?" Poor James...
LBOX PLAYERS ARE CRYINGGGGGGGGGGG
Ps4😭😭😭😭😭😭
I can’t wait I just hope and pray they don’t pull  a pt
z z z z z z z con todo afán de ofender
Silent Hill coming back???
Estuve esperando tanto por esto, hoy por fin se hizo realidad! Desde los innumerables rumores de la vuelta de la saga, ver la radio de sh2 en uno de los trailers de ps5 y como no la decepción que nos dejó Abandoned! Esperemos que la saga vuelva a lo más alto y venda mucho, lo mejor es que volvemos a tener a Akira Yamaoka y Masahiro Ito ❤️
Nice
bloober team 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Leon ? Is that you ?
Waited this for so long !!!
gothic 1 now silent hill.. my childhood.. both start the same.. xD
Why not Silent Hil 1?
Where is the releaseeeee daaaatttteeeeee
Silent Hill 2 Silent Hill: Townfall Silent Hill f <--- weird So much Silent Hill!!! 🤤
Why not Silent Hil 1?
Bored of re releases especially games that look like they are on the ps4 instead of ps5 graphics *sigh*
Seria isso a redenção da konami?
I'm glad its back
Beyond Silent Hill 2 for PS5, we’re getting new games with Townfall and f, a movie, merch, and more
What!?
This is the 2nd game other than RE that scared the bejeezes out of me during those PS2 days.
F yeah!!
1) Game looks great on UE5 but where's my film grain? It looks too "clean" without  it.  2) I will miss Guy Cihi's voice.  3) Not to look a gift horse in the mouth but why start remaking SH games with the best one? Should start with 1, it needs the graphical update the most.
Man... I can't believe it 🥲
😎
Once again, "Now all I need is a PS5".
Release it on ps4 please
So hyped for this!
Yay.  It’s going to be interesting to watch Bloober Team handle the themes of Silent Hill 2 with the subtlety of a brick in the face.
Holy shot y’all ready to make a poopy in your undies
PT 👍
Maria…..Are you Maria?
Akhirnya konami gerak lagi
Sorry for the playstation 4 users 🥴
So happy that they hired Leon Kennedy to play this!
I was waiting this moment for a years..
Hoy ganó el gaming kbro ns
MAGNÍFICO! MAGNÍFICO! =D
This is great and all, but can we just get a proper remaster of the original games on modern consoles?
El primer juego de miedo que jugué, antes de este no sabia que existían juegos de terror  Estaba peque
Meh pt looked wayyyy better way scarier tbh
This could mean my personal favorite silent hill 3 could be on the way, nice
I wonder if this is going to be an exclusive temporarily like FNAf security breach was?
SILENT HILL 2!!! LET'S GOOOO
Please please bring this to ps4
Wallah my eyes are all teary 🥲. I'm so happy. So many childhood memories.
Can't wait to see how Konami screws this up.  One of the most beloved horror titles created and I can't even have confidence that it's actual creators will do it justice after everything that came after SH2
Fckkkk this is so amazing, I can’t wait to play it, thanks Sony!
No te voy a mentir, el vato está feo
Too bad only 12 people will play it. No PS5 to buy anywhere
So I need to purchase Sony ScamStation 5 in order to play it. Gut myself doing physical work to earn it all - next gen console, 4k monitor, Sony overpriced game so few days before Silent Hill premiere PlayStation Saftey Team will ban me  and lock me out of my console. F*** you Sony, for real
Sustos que dan gusto
But why are they skipping over Silent Hill 1???
My girlfriend and I recently played the original PlayStation 2 game and thoroughly enjoyed it. We loved the ambiguous nature of it all portrayed by its atmosphere, tone and themes. I hope this remake does it justice by keeping the artistic life that makes the game so affective but also adds new aspects to make it stand on its own. We're very excited to play this remake!
remake fatal frame game too!
Mary could you really be in this town
As much as its cool to see a Remake of SH2.  I am not 100% confident on Bloober Team capturing the essence of the original following the projects they have done in the past.  Anyway. Welcome back Silent Hill ❤
In my restless dreams I see that town :( wordz hurts like sharp spike
💙😍
Leon, HELP!
It's about time Konami, I've been waiting for this for several years!! I would honestly love James to have the original voice, it was perfect for him. I feel happy, I had no hope in the saga but today it finally came true and what better than having Akira Yamaoka again ❤️
revivio el gaming
Made him look like McFly
James' face is a little TOO expressive, maybe?
SHE SAID THE NAMEEEEEEEEE 1:11
Count me in 😅😅😅😂😅😊am so excited 😆 for this one ☝🏾
Silent hill 2?
how come silent hill 2 and not 1?
am i dreaming ?! someone tell me please !!!!
Silent Hill 1 : " I'm a joke to you?... "
OMFG! Finally, almost 2 decade. Finally we've got a remake/remaster of our OG Silent Hill, so sad, its exclusive on PS5 but i got a positive tought, it will be release on any platform. thank you KONAMI, youre finally hear our scream on entire social media for an OG Silent Hill remake.
Even the size of that cockroach creeped me out. Hope it doesn't fly around in the game.
Finally a remake has come to silent hill franchise my favorite games from ps2, now comes to ps5 with remake version, can't wait to play adventure more horror.
Finally 🎉
If a hill falls in the woods, does it make a sound?
I play original Silent Hill 2 when  I was tennager, great memomries of one of Best games in history.
Ya no hay ideas nuevas... puro reciclaje
Hideo Kojima.
looks like trash lol
No one gonna ask why not Silent Hill 1?
Finally
It's been to long
AHUEVOO
Legend Is back🔥
Impossible..
Please release it also on PS4 🙏🏼🙏🏼
borat:MEI WEIFFE
honestly i don't like it, it looks amazing, but i can already see how the artstyle is kinda lost and that its not going to be terryfing.  those compressed oversaturated textures from the original live rent free in my nightmares
HOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLYHOLY
is this pt?
I walk… I can do nothing but walk. But then…I saw me walking in front of myself. but…it wasn’t really me. Watch out.  The gap in the door is a…Separate reality. The only me is me. Are you sure the that the only you is you?   Paper bag in P.T.
Acho que esse é o titulo mais pesado da franquia, principalmente depois que a historia tem seu desfecho e ele descobre a verdade.
Bro the music!!! Sheer chills and that was just the frigging teaser! Yamaoka is masterclass of a musician and composer, the PS5 is an absolute must get now. This franchise was a game changer in the horror genre of gaming, seriously cannot wait to see this through!
YES!!! 😭😭😭😭😭 SILENT HILL IS BACK!!!
Graphics are cool, but I hope there’s an option to change the voice-acting back to the classics.
Nixya sebe Whhaaaaaaaaaaat!!!!
I am now spooked
Aaaasssh What a bad decision that this remake has been developed by bloober team🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I don't wanna see more cries from Ryan about Xbox's "monopoly" after the exclusive stunt you pulled here. They can't make CoD exclusive, but you can make Silent Hill one. You have no shame Sony.
The protagonist looks in the mirror cliche.
Better be faithful to the original. I don't want woke leftist politics injected.
🤡
Well I'll be damned looks like Konami are tired of pachinko games and decided to take back their seat at the top 🔥
Will this be coming out for ps3?
Lets hope this remake will be like the original, no help, letting the player figure out what to do. Also I hope it has all the endings in the same we we could have in the original.
Funny how we're skipping a remake of Silent Hill 1 for 2 but hey I aint complaining!
Why silent hill 2? Is this remake or what?
sh2 is a masterpiece no need to remake. they should have made that silent hills pt instead
Idk. It really wasn’t that great. Seems bland.
Leon, is that you?
I hope they still put pyramid head hot scene... hehehehe. 4k baby
mary is blue eyed blonde that mary is bs
Nice grafics
Did they use the same re engine?
That's the most uncanny Japanese-looking white man in the world.
Haven't been that impressed with Bloober but I'm VERY excited about reanimating the Silent Hill series, RE can't have all the limelight!
Meh
Meh.
You dont know, what a teaser is lol
My childhood game ＼(^o^)／＼(^o^)／
As a 35 yr old dude, my early teen self is excited af
Is it related to P.T. in any way?
LO AMOOOOO 😍
Kept you waiting... Huh.
Where’s the remake of Silent Hill 1?
有沒有支援中文？
Gaming has won today
Yay
leon '-'
So it a remake?
What a waste of a remake.....
why 2 not 1 ?
Leon’s dad
What about Silent Hill 1?
0:45 - ICONIC! 🙌  Silent Hill is Back! Can't believe it! 🤩
Mid
I hope it’ll be scary like PT
I remembered buying my PS2 bundled with this game and MGS2 back in early 2002, it was one of my happiest moment in gaming, no gadgets, no online multiplayer, just me and my PS2 till dawn
Rather have Silent Hills though.
yeeeeeeee boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Oh my gosh!!!! So ready to experience this!  I know I’ll be the only one on here to say this, but I never got to play the Silent Hill games…
this is lit but really bummed it’s a ps5 exclusive
Finally 🥲
Silent Hill 1 aparentemente não existe :(
Yas silent hill the real horror games
This feels like its gonna be a disaster
now do mgs konami
No way……finally the suits understand what the consumers want.
Konami is on the road for redemption.
Next gen Pyramid Head?! Um...yes please and thank you.
Never played a silent hill, wonder if I need to play others before this one?
Keanu Reeves?
Apenas 💙
Y el 1 ???
Yes! Let's goooo
Silent hill PS5 💙
Is there a release date or release window for this, or any of the other Silent Hill games that were announced?
I wanted to hear Themes Of Laura in this 😭
bruh look like if Leon Kennedy was stressed out and married
But you can't make Cod exclusive jahahaha fukng hypocrites
Leon
It doesn't have same vibe as P.T.
Después de tanto tiempo regresa el fenómeno.
Keep it up Sony
KINDA CANT WAIT
Silent Hill 2 again?!  Lost opportunity to have a new proper Silent Hill return.
it was the dog the whole time!
What!? Only for ps5??! NOOOOOOOO!!
si sale el final del perrito, todo bien
Finally, konami remember this game.
I'm going to enjoy playing this on my PC with my PS5 controller
Pyramid head looks terrifying af
Sooo.... Leon's getting old now?   Hmm....
hope this game not comes with 30fps
They could have done a better job with James, but other than that the game looks fantastic.
This looks absolutely amazing
Where is theme of laura?
Will this have any influence of PT? Because PT was supposed to be teaser of cancelled Silent Hill?
Yo what’s Leon Kennedy doing here?
Hopefully they get the radio static and fog right this time around! also on the original version did anyone get spooked on the save screen when it went all red? 😂
Several years later, bring back pt
2024? or later?
I don’t know why I can see ‘LEON’ in this game. Anyone else does have some feeling?😆
James' actor is Black Sails' Woodes Rogers, yeah? Luke Roberts. Awesome.  Konami and Playstation should keep the Leash TIGHT on bloober. Don't let them stray.
We want Silent Hills.
Im in
This like PT?
Por fin luego de años de espera que crei que nunca lo harian 🥹❤️🔥 es hermoso
Kazakhstan PSN 🤬🤬🤬
unreal engine 5 looks amazing
Mary been bad!
Can't wait to see the Dashie gameplay.
This satisfies my itch.
This made my day thank Konami… feel bad for Xbox people tho…
Amazing💯.
Why does he look like an older version of Leon from the RE2 Remake..
I thought he would look younger hahaha, this is amazing update!!!
Can you Imagine how scary this will be with the PS5 hardware capabilities?!
Konami is back!!!
😐This does not  Mean anything if there's no game play to show that they're actually trying this time To make a game
Very excited about this, Silent Hill 2 was always my favorite Silent Hill game. But also extremely disappointed (though not surprised) that Guy Cihi isn't involved. He'll always be James Sunderland to me.
FINALLY! A next gen LOOKING game. It looks amazing.
No la caguen por fis, tan bonitos recuerdos del SH2
Hellooooo Nurseeee! 2:11
Silencio gil 2 por fin
Makes sense. I just spent 40 dollars for the silent hill hd collection last week, so of course this is announced right after.
Tears of joy and happiness in my eyes  Finally!!!
Bloober team? 😔 … bad news
Too bad it took RE2 remake success to them to BELIEVE and SEE that SH2 could be successful too 🥲 but oh well the day finally came 🤩😘
Is it the art style or does James look older?
Piramid head my man!
Is this the silent hill game where (spoilers-I guess) the dog is the mastermind in a secret ending? If so I will play this even though I am not a big fan of horror at all.
Hoy gano el gaming
This product feels as weak as the movie. SH2, SH3 and other jewels from the PS2 era don't need remakes and not even remasters, those old glorious videogame achievements only need backward compatibility. Come on, Sony, stop wasting money in poor imitations of the real thing. If you are gonna make remakes,better target PS1 games. 😆😆😆😆😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
looks like Leon Kennedy the character
So glad to see Leon Kennedy in another game
Я НЕ ВИДЕЛ SILENT HILL УЖЕ ДЕСЯТЬ ТЫСЯЧ ЛЕТ!
О господи,это правда ты?🥲❤
tão deixando a gente sonhar 😉
We want silent hills from Kojima not remake old ga
Can't wait to see the "True ending" in 4k
Silencio Gil 2
I never played silent hill 2 before so excited cant wait😍
YES!!! LET’S GO!! Been waiting for this for so long!!
They didn’t even bother putting any of the original music. Disappointment already
Bloober Team strikes again! I love this dev so much.
Finally, the best horror game is returning
Is Konami actually doing stuff now? Did they have a change of leadership or something?
I hope that in the future the remake of 1 will be made
They will mess this up so bad
🤩🤩🤩
very excited to see silent hill make a return i just hope bloober team handle the themes of the game properly
This is shocking. I never thought I'd see this ever happen  This might be a pre order for me
Why does the character looks like older Leon.
I prefer old james sunderland charracter face design....this one...a little bit off..  Over all i'm glad Konami back to the right way...no more pachinko ! just more video games
Wait silent hill? Remake?
Why remake 2 before 1?
so happy about the players who could play these games. and so sorry about my self since Im not gonna be able to play. dont have a PC or a Ps5 😭😭😭
Lo hicieron despues de años de pedido de los Fan...hicieron el tan deseado REMAKE... era la unica que faltaba del genero survival horror, de esos tiempos dorado del Genero... no es lagrima sino me entro una nostalgia en los ojos😪
Cool that this is back, but... why is James so emotional? A huge part of James's character, what makes him so memorable, is that he's so weirdly distant and disconnected from everything. Even his reason for coming to Silent Hill, looking for Mary, he's not totally sure if he should be doing it or if he even wants to. In this, he seems desperate, frustrated, scared, all things that he was in the original, but never showed at all. All of that was reflected in the monsters he fought; they were his pent-up emotions given flesh, while he acted so bizarrely inhuman towards everything going on around him. This new James just feels too dramatic for the sake of being dramatic, for being a relatable protagonist, which James absolutely never was. By making him wear his emotions on his sleeve like this, rather than showcasing how he's felt for years through the monsters he fights, it just makes them weird demons that are in Silent Hill; they're no longer representations of James's feelings about his situation that he's kept repressed all this time, they're just mindless things that want to hurt James, like any other video game enemy.
Amazing, I’m so glad to see it
Not will have for ps4? pretty bad 👎
ESTO SON PALABRAS MAYORES. Si no le dedican el amor y el tiempo que esta obra se merece, ya puede  ir preparándose, porque la comunidad exigirá las cabezas de los responsables clavadas en una pica.
Looks quite promising but I wish they kept Guy Cihi as James.
I was waiting for this...for sooooo loong time.
Developed by a non Japanese dev. No thanks.
I now have a reason to buy a PS5. My absolute favorite horror game series is finally back! Its been way to long Silent Hill.. Of course they remaster my favorite game of the series. 😂 just take my money already
keep the demo in the console just incase..
Depois de anos a espera.
Exclusive for PS5??? 😔
Oh man everyone is hyped for lock door simulator 2
Now that Silent HIll had its run on pachinko machines, it's back in console form on the PS5.
Yeeeeess sir
Finally!
exclusive for PS5 ?
Its that neon?
YOOOOOOOO
Day one pre order!!
But The most important question here is: Will this new SH 2 version have 🐶Dog and 🛸UFO ending or will all be cut in DLC or will be scrapped content ...??
Never really got into silent Hill.... Not really my cup of coffee. Maybe it's just me. Lol
Dude this looks sick
HAH LEON
This is going to be wild
Sad that there’s no Guy Cihi, the true James Sunderland in my eyes
Konami better not drop the ball with this game! Most of us are still bitter about the P.T. Game not going though
Dreams do come true.
I cant fuckjng wait to play this im so hypeddddddddd
!!!!!!!!!!!
James 😍 Loviu
Remember what Mason said in Call of Duty Cold War. Don’t get distracted by the Nostalgia.
not scary at all
Haven't been this excited for a game in a long time
If it's $70, I better hear everybody complaining instead of cheering.
I'm feeling James' looks kinda weird. I mean, I know its a remake but it looks like a random dude cosplaying James
Ay yooo
This is going to be mind-blowing been waiting years for this hoping that they would remake this game a it going to happen hopefully as long as it doesn't get cancelled like the the last game I'm also hoping they add the extra campaign where you play Maria it's going to be 2001 all over again
Finally 🥺
PS4 PLEASE !!
Don’t shoot me. I’m the biggest silent hill 2 fan. I literally listen to the music to help me sleep, but the iconic shot of James looking in the mirror… is it just me or did it not like that great? The rest. Stunning. But James looked a little…. PS4
i hope the game not too silent 😁
Estoy llorando 😭 💗
Can’t wait to see abstract daddy in hd
Silent Hill 2???   Can't ANYONE come up with an original game anymore??  Most of PS5 games are all remakes and or remasters
Konami: ...Kept you waiting, huh?
New Silent Hill PS5 game please 🙏🏻
They can’t change the letter towards the end. That’s the only thing that shouldn’t be remade. They simply can’t.
2 words. White Noiz👁
I WANT TO CRY! 😔😢
Its Leon ?
Brasil
Just got a reason to finally buy a ps5
I think PS4 can run this game.
Is this a remake of Silent Hill 2?
Whelp, looks like it is time to relive the psychological torment of my adolescence in glorious HD.
Eyyy Yo!!!
Wow it looks great!
I'm crying
😐
Woooooow!!  Finally!!
This looks amazing
NO WAY! I cant wait to play this.
I just hope they won’t pull of a Resident evil 2 or 3 with cut content I’d be mad
*This was not creepy at all*  someone needs to call team silent for some pointers
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Gracias diosito
I waited for so long, waiting for 20+ years!
The new GTA 6 is nothing compared to this.  It's the most awaited thing for billions.
What a time to be alive! I never thought I’d see the day. Silent Hill was always better than RE imo
Remake?
UM GIGANTE ACABA DE ACORDAR!
El fedewolf tiene que ver esto
Espero que el hotel mantenga esa ambientación tan melancólica
The graphics seems odd.
fund sh 5 sony
It seems that he is the brother of León S Kennedy
this is great🙂
Thank you, for once
Finally Silent Hill is back!!
This need to look better or similar to RE4 remake no less, no less
Man 3D ANIMATION has come a long way… i’m an 80’s baby.
Guy Cihi will always be James.
One of the most influential games, along with early resident evils, that shaped my gaming world along with Diablo 1&2.  Part of why I despise D3 and it's rainbows, bright lights, and forgettable music.
Xbox fan boys punching the air right now 😂
Please Bloober, don’t mess up this remake.
I cant believe this is actually happening
It ain't silent hills but I'll take it.
The music in this trailer gives me the chills
This is a game that definitely deserved a remake *cough* melee combat and puzzles *cough*. And while bloober team did make the medium which was mediocre, they’ve got a framework this time and know what they need to strive for.
20 añitos para este momento
Rip to those who have passed before seeing this game.
This town is fUUUUuuUUUlll of monsters!
Excellent after silent hill please work on another castlevania
Please bring this to Xbox series x too❤
Think they'll add the Born from a Wish scenario??
this game is special to me silent hill 2 will always be my fav can.t wait to see james  jacket flutter in the wind
Not gonna lie for a moment I thought this was fake lol
There is Silence in this Hill...
I hope it can be the same level as P.T., chances are small but we can all dream.
never played Silent Hill before and I've been it's the best survival horror game, looking forward to trying it out.
this isn't a pachinko machine?
*No censorship in the US release Konami!!!*
Wish the og voice actor for James was back
But somehow James is too emotional compared to original Jame, I love that expression
Best horror game ever.  Do right by it, please.
Silent Hills Back But A Remake Like The Resident Evils 2 & 3 Silent Hills 2 The Remake Cool 😎
James kinda looks like the RE2R version of human william birkin mixed with jon bernthal now.
😍😍😍
I was on the fence with the RE2Remake.  After hearing excellent word of mouth, I gave it a chance.  Awesome game.  It’s different, but what they got right, knocked it out of the park.  I really hope SH2R does the same, or better.     My only gripe is; “I just got a steam deck, I have to get a PS5?!” 😂
Pinch me , is this really happening!!!
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My body is ready
Didn’t think I’d ever hear from this franchise again the trailer looks great but we’ll have to wait and see if Konami can stick the landing this time
Too bright, Too Cartoonist a bit, how is this supposed to he scary?
So apparently Konami decided to hire new business people possessing above average IQ levels, to make some better gaming decisions. Well better late than never, I'd say😒
Did I miss soemthing? Was there another silent hill before this recently?
I’ve never played this before, but it looks really exiting! Do you have to play silent hill 1 to be able to understand it? (Assuming there is a 1 of it according to the title SH2)
A remake? I was hoping for something new as well. I'm excited for this tho it looks epic 👌🏽🔥
Oh no.
whats blooper team??
Otro exclusivo temporal de PlayStation, luego lloran por Activision Blizzar.
Thank you for NOT making this game for PS4. This generation can finally start with a current-gen release only running on unreal 5 engine.
I can't get over how awful this looks. This is giving me HD collection vibes.  Their direction for the game will be "just add more detail" Simply look at how the original handled the iconic mirror scene. The strong shadows makes it looks like James is looking at himself in a pitch black void is extremely unsettling. Not only that but if you up the contrast, James is looking at you the entire time.  Then you have bloober, they add more detail to the mirror, completely destroying any unsettling imagery of the dark void and the small detail of James looking at the player, replaced with a dumb expression that's completely out of character for James.
Bro WHAT IS HAPPENING
Is Maria still gonna look like Christina Aguilera at the 1999 teen choice awards?
I glad silent hill is back on the console that started it the Playstation I know it going look great on the ps5 I so happy 😊 😃 😀 😄 😁 🤣 😊 😃
But why not on PS4 too, Capcom is better than you
my restless dreams.. have come true
Pensé que Konami la iba a cagar sacando un pachinko
When is P.T. 2?
This town is full of monsters. How can you sit there and eat pizza?!
Q dia triste para os caixinhas
Best come back so far🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Fazia tempo que não me animava com um jogo, o SH2 é uma obra de arte, tomara que a Konami acerte e traga um jogo fantástico
The atmosphere looks on point. They need to update that mirror scene though. James' face shouldn't look that expressive in that scene and his hand gesture should go over his face like in the original. I mean, it's a nit-pick, but that scene is too iconic. Him being so overly expressive kind of takes away from the mysticism of it all imo. Anyway, seeing as SH2 is my favorite horror game of all time, I'm keeping a healthy level of skepticism.
He looks like a older version of Chris Redfield from re2 lol
Ps4?
cant wait for the xbots to come out about the timed exclusive after they was acting big when cod is only going to move to xbox
When does the game come out
Is it Troy Baker return as James Sutherland...?
Woah
Ta, deveria ser remake do primeiro, primeiro.
Yeezz i was never felt this uneasy in my life and it barley showed anything.
So we finally get a PS5 game that isn't restricted by being a cross-gen title, and it's just another "remake"
Konami...that says it all. 👎
No puedo creer lo que vi me siento la persona mas feliz del mund0+_+
Call Of Duty
Yeiii another remake, im so happy 😒
OH MY WORD YES
For the players...PS4
Awesome
INCREIBLE.
Better than nothing (P.T.) I guess
Ahh, can’t wait!!! ❤
How can you just sit there and eat pizza?!
at 1:54 the ambience sounds like mgsv sortie prep.... I'm watching you konami😏
Leon?!?!...
About to burst into tears of nostalgia
I'm obsessed with part 3 but part 2 is VERY ICONIC" HOORAY FOR Konami for this 💯💯
Oh boy what a time to be alive. I remember being hard stuck on some of the puzzles in this game as a kid!
deberian hacer con mas cariño la gráfica de los juegos... se nota que estan desesperados de ideas...
They tried to do a PT Easter egg but, it only made it worse because I was waiting for that radio to cut on 😔
After The Medium I would've looked forward to any project by Blooper team but this just looks out of this world! The art department really delivered here and if the gameplay is on par this is going to be insane.
Please give us MGS 1 remake next Sony 🙏
If Leon S. Kennedy never went to the RCPD
Siempre hacen esto de exclusividad por un año y después lloran por que microsoft compra una empresa llorones y sinverguenzas es lo que son 😂😂😂😂
a ps5 exclusive....sigh
what an amazing time to be a gamer
So it's a ps5 exclusive?
I’m so glad that they didn’t change lines and had similar voice actors. Keeps the vibe
so many memories. I am almost crying right now!
Welcome to My life happiness ❤️
so is this a silent hill 2 remake?
MGS Konami, please.
me estay weiando? o.o
Was there a silent hill 1 remake?
I'm sceptical considering it's Konami and when trying to remaster this game, it failed. So I can't imagine how bad they could mess up a remake of this
E essa arma toda quadrada! Esperava bem mais dos gráficos.
I knew it 🗿
I was waiting for this for a long time. glatias tibi ago.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
FINALY!
No eggs bugs?
yay 12mo of being a selfish little kid that doesn't want to share with everyone
“You’ve given me so much… and I haven’t been able to return a single thing!”  “James… you made me happy”
Las animaciones fáciles 🤯🤯
Nice now i want a Dino Crysis comeback!
I mean that's great and all, but I still would have wanted to know what it would have been if Kojima was making Silent Hills. And I'm not sure if I'm reading too much into this, but that cockroach opening looked exactly like PT soooooooo re-used assets?
The best
No release date nice👍
"Wishlist Now" - It ain't even searchable yet on the storefront! Not to mention, your wishlist is busted anyways. I've wishlisted games and that I ended up pre-ordering and getting, but they're still listed on my wishlist after buying.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
*plays Silent Hills by Kendrick to celebrate*
🤩🤩😭😭😭🤩🤩🤩🤩😭😭😭🤩🤩🤩😭🤩😭🤩😭 I can't describe how I feel right now. I hope for more Silent hill series, thank you Konami 💖💖💖
Is this real? My childhood horror is coming back to life? Let's goooooooooooo!
A part of me was lowkey expecting to see Norman Reedus for some reason. Probably because I still think about that P.T game all those years ago and how I think it's similar to Silent Hill in a way.
Finalmente, se dignaron los hdp de Konami.
Cautiously optimistic
My body is ready.
Hopefully this means reboot is coming sooner rather than later
bueno , me compro una Play 5 ... afertas ??? : (  , o espero un Año para jugarlo en Pca Full 4k : D
what month do u know
TIMED EXCLUSIVE GAME.
HYPED!
YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Just like the recent Halloween sequels, where John Carpenter does the score, this will be worth it just for Akira Yamoaka's new tracks alone.
Is this game for the xbox ?? 😢
Is it a Playstation exclusive? 😔
Never played a silent hill and yet I'm a 1991 baby
James looks like Sherry Birkin's true father. Poor William...
cross gen?
why ps exculsive
I hope Playstation Studios will help Bloober as much as they can.
Yay! Fog!
WHERE METAL GEAR Solid
Finally
…am I the only one thinking he looks like Leon? From R.E
Y pum cancelado like Silent Hills, xd
I want a Norman reedus skin for this game.
What xbox needed to prove that Cod's exclusivity is valid
Are these the voice actors from 2012s remaster or brand new (I can tell they’re not the original)
pogu
To be perfect they could remake the original trailer. I would cry! Can’t wait to play the best horror game ever again.
A white male lead.  Wow this has white supremacyyyy all over it!!!!!
PlayStation complaining about Xbox turning Call of Duty into an exclusive, and then taking one of the most important games of all time and turning it into an exclusive for PS5...
🥲     ps4 please 😭
Ohio
The year of horror games. Can't wait!
Not gonna lie it looks amazing but instead doing a remaster of the game why not just finally give us a brand new SH game.
Glad its coming on pc
Tell me this is not a joke,  this is REAL....a remake of Silent Hill 2, Konami is back at doing VIDEO GAMES?
Needs more shiba inus.
whos that guy with the pyramid head?
joe is in the hill too
Wait, are you trolling us or is this real? 😀
なるほど
No Kojima = DOA
Heat 🔥. I bet Xbox is frightened
They couldn't do silent Hill one 🙄?
Still prefer if Hiteo Kojima was still involved
My prayers have been answered
While im glad silent hill 2 remake is finally revealed, where's silent hill 1?
After all the fan Trailers, this is so freaking crazy for me to see. It's Real guys. It isn't a dream anymore. In our restless dreams, we see the town again! Can't wait for this.
Despues de muchos años  salio minimo un remake de sillent hill que se ve bueno y terrorifico, ojala Konami no la cague
What was wrong with his original face tho
Now wait for 3 years to come out…..🙄
Somebody pinch me. This isn't real right?
How on earth do people enjoy puzzle games
Ill buy a PS5 for this game.
Where kojima
City of ghost
Pada sombong komen pake bahasa inggris semua mentang" gua gak bisa
Ну наконец то!😍
Man I never knew Leon Kennedy went to Silent Hill
Leon
Gracias!!!
So, this's Silent Hill 2 Remake and Harry Mason looks like Leon Scott Kennedy from Re2 Remake 🙂?.
A este pequeño momento de mi vida lo llamo felicidad 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🩸🔪💉
DAY 1. PREORDER RIGHT NOW, COME ON COME ON
I'm assuming combat is going to stay clunky lol
ªªªªªªªªªaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAA 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This looks a bit underwhelming. Looks PS4 if I'm honest 😕
Please don’t have that terrible voice acting as seen in the trailer we need the originals
me acabo de caer de culo al ver esto
Why does he look like Luis Carruthers?
I can't believe they remaking the best Silent Hill
Podia nos créditos finais do game mostra o corpo da esposa dele no porta-malas iria ser de arrepiar  Uma pena o SH1 não receber um Remake tbm
It looks great but it's the last reveal that has really captured my attention. SILENT HILL IS BACK! But it needs to follow that original aesthetic of Japanese subtle horror not western " BOO did I scare you horror.
Where is May Elizabeth Mcglynn?
PlayStation  The brand for re remakes and remasters.
I want a ps5
No release date. Won’t be out for 3-4 years.
saw the unreal engine logo at the end, yup Unreal Engine 5 confirmed 💕
Ojalá salga todo bien que sea un juegazo y que venda mucho, esta saga se lo merece
Hopefully they switch to ps4 as well like the re4 remake, if not super bad decision
I've been rejoicing in the streets yelling at strangers that silent hill is back. Might have to dress up for Halloween going as James Sunderland and Cheryl mason
Very nervous about whether or not Bloober can pull this off. Most of their other games haven't quite knocked my socks off
This is a step in the right direction I want all their games remade and new games from this franchise
I still don’t trust Konami but I’ll give it a shot
okay so also who else wonders if they are going to add the dog ending to this game :D
I’m a resident evil fan and never had the opportunity to play silent hill I’m definitely buying it no hesitation let’s go baby 🔥🔥
F u microsht jajajaja  Exclusive xD  Thats a goool Sony PlayStation always the best
Legend is back!!!
Can't wait I hadn't played it since I fired up my PS2
❤️
DANGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG BRUH
Looks awesome, eventhough I hate horros, but silent hill series always had something unique in it
F**K Konami
Next remake  metal gear..snaaake
Pls can I get a free ps5
I'll stay somewhat cautious, because it's Konami after all
Can't wait for it. Dissappointed we didn't get a Kojima Silent Hill. But Silent Hill F gives me some Kojima vibes. Deep down i feel like Kojima is involved with Silent Hill F. It screams Kojima. A man can hope😭
Konami: I don't look like any "ghost" do I?
very excited, trailer wasnt amazing, the tone seems off but still very hopeful
The Silent Hill crossovers other games got were received so we'll, Silent Hill finally returned
Just have bluepoint do all the remake to our fav classics pls sony.
I don't know, man...I kinda don't feel the atmosphere - way too bright and colorfull, and this Leon S. Kennedy looking character is putting me off.
Looks really bland. SH2 doesn't need a direct remake, it needs some fresh ideas like it was in Shattered Memories. With such direct approach it will be another 6 out of 10 game from Bloober team. Sad, very sad.
bloober team...
SILENTHILL BACK  YEAHHHH!!
PS4?
Xbox punching the air rn
Why
Will silent hill 2 remake be 70 dollars
What about the other 3 games, are they gonna be remade as well. Silent Hill 1 and Silent Hill 3 and Silent Hill 4 the room. I hope they’re gonna get remade as well.
<3.<3
😃😃😲😲👍👍💜
It was bloober team all along 🎉
I really wish it wasn't Bloober team. Would have much rather had a team with a better track record. Like get the Alien Isolation team or Blupoint studio.
Broo.... So glad the franchise is back
Я в ахуе просто!
I'm do happy to that its hard to put my happiness into words ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I made a second Silent Hill games series or remake.
time for wating is now done let the silent hill games begin
Didn't think I'd ever have to re-live this nightmare but, here we are
My soul is so ready for this!
Que lindo 🥲🥲🥲
TE AMO KONAMIIIII
What happened to Abandoned??
Vamos los piiiibeeeeeeesss
Please PlayStation just buy Konami so you can make a new silent hill.
❤️🙌😍
f i n a l l y
Game of decade for sure
Are the other Silent Hill games getting a remake? 🤔
now we play it on the newest console
Meh.. games just dont excite me like they used too
So Konami canceled Silent Hills and green lit a remake of Silent Hill 2 instead? Talk about one step forward, two steps back. At least it's not a pachinko machine... I suppose that's progress.
Después de haber visto el tráiler unas 10 veces puedo decir que las primeras veces me parecieron meh , ahora que lo detalle más puedo decir que se ve un 7.8/10 el trailer me hubiera gustado ver un poco del gameplay pero a esperar
Konami ya dió su brazo a torcer con un remake, es cuestión de tiempo para que permitan el regreso de PT
я чего  чего второй начали? первая круче же
Konami remembered they made games.  Alright
Akira yeah   O yeah that’s great
Konami, don't you go messing with my feelings! You've burned me before!
exlusive hmm u talking abut xbx cod but u doing this im not into this consol war but i really hope Microsoft pull the cod ip from psn its fair why u guys should get cod if we not getting sillent hill 🤷‍♀️
Yes gimme!
Ugh. Bloober team. Looks like this will be another "game" you watch instead of play. So sick of these walking simulators and now it's infested silent hill.
PlayStation exclusive baby, that’s how I like it
Cant find it on the psn store so i cant whish list it
I screeched when I saw this trailer on my feed. I was hoping for a remake. Woohoo!
Se me paro el PN con este traíler
man i really wanted to see orgins
Silent Hill is back baybee!!
I wish they make pc port
I can't get this on game pass 😭😭 sony so not pro consumer.. 😂😂😂😂
Thanks for protecting my rights as a gamer and not influencing my choice with timed exclusives.
so cool to see this!!!
Como quiabo cru?
Main Char Looks like PewDiePie 0:35 . "Stephano? Is that you?"
hope not another Fan service.
Xbox players 💀💀💀
Wait konami still makes games. Even if it's a remake of classic
Silent Hill 2: It's real, but will be a PS5 exclusive.   "We have everything, yet we have nothing  "
In my restless Dreams, i see that franchise returns...Silent Hill. Grateful to be able to see this
coming soon to PS2
Sony buy Konami now! Lol
Didn't realize the protag was in his 40s
Why is this called silent hill 2?
Capolavoro Assoluto 😍❤️🔝
For 21 years... In my restless dreams... I see that town...
Ps4 Pro?
Man, Leon looks great in Resident Evil 9
For ps5 ? Really looks ugly 🤷‍♂️ ps 2 looks better 👍
😱😱😱
Observer is Blooder Team's best game and you should play it.
duuuuuuude YEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS
Por fin, después de tantos años, al fin fuimos escuchados.. El mejor juego en su género .
Blooper is officially the cheat code, All must surrender, I’ve heard people doubt them because of the medium, But this only proves just how amazing the team is, Definitely can’t wait for this one.
I understand all the hype, but we must not forget there was a Silent Hill 1 earlier before this one. I’d definitely be happier if they released it instead of this.
And the remakes continue, Looks nice but needs film grain to add some texture as it looks too clean.
BOOOP....Nice!
Finally, let’s go!
Shouldn’t it be Silent Hill 5???
I hope Blooper Team  can keep the game at 60fps this time.
FINALLLLYYYYYYY TAKE MY MONEY
What a difference, cant wait to get my hands on this. Beat it long time ago
please sony and konami advertise the game for playstation 4
WE DESERVE IT
Can we get a proper remake of 1?
La feeeee
Awesome!
Great news 🔥but I’m not sure about bloober team 😅
sobre Silent Hill F Ryukishi07 es el creador de la novela de terror Higurashi no Naku Koro ni y Umineko no Naku Koro ni de la saga When They Cry muy famosa en Japón y en el extranjero
Siempre con la niebla...
Now bring back that Contra game game you promised us 10+ years ago.
We need Silent Hill 3 and Silent Hill The Room on PS5.
Yeeeeeessssss!!!!!
Yessss!!!! YESSS AND PLZ YES
Stop making remakes do the new games pls, stop it !
this is gonna be epic I can't wait and finally a ps5 exlusive game as well:)
Great unveiling but how long do we have to wait
So has everyone forgot about kojima silent hill
I thought of playing this, BUT THEN I REMEMBERED WHAT KONAMI DID TO KOJIMA, I WONT PLAY ANY KONAMI GAME EVER AGAIN
18 mins
Feeling in love and depressed now
I am so happy beyond expression that Silent Hill is back, it's just unbelievable
Leon?
Thought it was Dahmer
Yesssssssssss ❗️❗️❗️❗️
Why would they remake 2 and not 1???
Finalmente a Konami acordou . Só falta um Castlevania.
Sony, which makes everything exclusive, cries when blizzard buys Xbox
Finally is here!
主角全程一副苦瓜脸，看着就衰到不行。😅
Shoutout to all the fans who didn't live through COVID19 who wanted to play this game.
Silent Hill and Resident Evil legitimately terrified me back in the 90s and early 2000s as a kid. I’ve since conquered all the Resident evil games… but silent hill man has always legitimately freaked me out… im about to dive in
Господи, 20 лет прошло, колледж прогуливал чтобы на компе пройти её. Пиратка на 2-х дисках.
Nice 👍
Dios mio ahahahahahahah!
AHHHHHHHHHH
So from here on out all games are going to be remakes? Got it
Silent Hill 1 remake que bom nada né Konami e Sony 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮😡
Let's gooooooooooooo!!!!!!
Yes!!!
Agora sim em 4k, coisa linda!
vuaaaaaaamooooooooossssssssssssssssssssssssssss
yupii
AHHHHHHH
Vergaaaaa no ma. Es lo más que se acerca. Ya me vi.
Being a resident evil fan I never gave silent hill a chance but I am aware how popular it is. Before this comes out should I play all silent hill original games or only a select few? Thanks in advance to any silent hill fans out there
What a time to be alive, remake of the best classics ever, RE, Silent hill, demon souls, all with extremely beautiful graphics!
So we skipping sh1?
Siuuuuuuuuu
que también salga para PS4 xD
Looks Amazing 💜💜💜 Original SH2 is one of my favourite games ever. Can’t wait to see more and hopefully there will be demo, please 😁
Holy shiiii
Silent Hill 2 Remake Is here The Hype is over 9000!
We asked for P.T./Silent HillS. Next.
Yes, yes, and yes.
Ethan winters suffering never ends.
This the one with the dog ending? Will there still be the dog ending?
AAAH BLOOBER TEAM MY DUUUDDESS THANK YOUU
In my restless dreams, I see that town...
Playstation 5 Exclusive Ok Now the others can have Call of Duty exclusive
Esse momento da minha vida, se chama felicidade
I’m going to watch this like a million times. Still can’t believe this is real.
🎉
So uh... yeah. Bloober was working on this, afterall.  All I need to know now, is when... When can I travel back into the Mist?
Almost forgot about this series 😅
SILENT HILLS IS BETTER THAN WOKE PROPAGANDA OF US GAMES
Let's see how Konami screws this up...
Silent Hill not made by Japanese devs is not Silent Hill
Been waiting 20 years.. it's about time
thanks Sony! For supporting the revival of a beloved franchise ❤
Yesssssssssssssssssssssss....
Now bring back Dino Crisis after this please!
So glad this franchise rise up again, but sadly i don't owned PS5, wish they could release it on xbox
O exclusivo que eu estava precisando. Boa Sony! ❤️
Remember: This is still Konami. I have little faith.
Never played it cause I can’t do scary games but will definitely watch dashie or someone else play it!
Cool! Looking forward to this 👍
Let’s goooo!
Shut up and take my money.
Ayo WHAT
silent hill is back from the grave!!! I'm so happy!!!
so happy Silent Hill is returning to home (console)....next stop Metal Gear...
Can't wait to play this on ps4
I was here
This is awesome
After so long since we’ve had a new installment, after the unfortunate cancellation of silent hills…I’m so glad this franchise is coming back!
Disgruntled Leon
Just so you guys know, it's coming to STEAM Along with ps5. But will probably come to Xbox after 1 year of its release (Not confirmed).
Yes!!! Let's Goooo!!! 😁 👍
what a hypocrisy sony doesn't want microsoft to launch exclusives, but can you? hypocrites
I hope this is faithful to the original. I always wanted to play it, but I couldn't.
POR FIN !!! , GRACIAS PLAYSTATION T-T
Who’s the bloober team? Not the ones who’s making the game abandoned right
You better really push this game hard, Sony
Welcome to Silent Hill...
Valio la pena los 10 años de espera, que te costaba Konami hacer las cosas bien.
PlayStation showcase
I was hoping for a collection port but this is still exciting
So glad the franchise is back, just hope blooper is getting the guidance they really need. This can put SH back on the map!
I'm very sad it's only for PS5 :/ but lucky those of you who have it, I hope you're part of those players who love the SH franchise
Looks great.
Look it’s Leon from RE4 😂😂😂
Where's the original,That's the one that needs a remake
Poor man's Chris redfield
when can we place a pre order?
Bloober ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
huh so this is a thing?
SILENT HILL fans are finally resurrected!
Give it to me now
This looks so crappy…the original was much more mature than this…also not sure why there won’t be a PS4 version - the graphics don’t look advance to anything the PS4 can’t produce
Present 1 minute
Yooooooooo, that's gonna be awesome, can't wait to play!
LETS GO W PLAYSTATION
No way
This is gonna be 🔥🔥🔥
It's been 84 years...
Почему здесь графика 2010 года?
Cant wait for this to be in dbd
YOOOOOOOOOO
Nice!!
