Congrats on the new building!😊🎉🎉
Sandwiches are good..... keep on making them.😊✌️
🙏🏾I often hear content creators, say, they are sorry,👈🏽for the lack of content. I don’t want 🫵🏽you to do anything , but👌🏽to workshop, what is , your revelation.💥     I see 👀into, the inter-connected souls, who are generating, at different rates, of vibration. 🤔
Why did you leave your dad at Matt's off-road recovery
4x4 your brother's truck
We want a update on your brother's truck
Rudy do the simple projects first and this way it's done and off your list of "To Do". Good video
Take your time and enjoy the process or it just is not worth the sweat. Have fun!
Ah, I was wondering what was going on. This was posted a year ago and it for some reason got suggested to me and shows as unwatched... but my thumbs-up is still there. Youtube being Youtube.
I’m confused.. y’all frame swapped the C10 months ago.. so is this old footage?
I was curious why you are so skinny
Dang!!!
look god Rudy *S
Don't worry about the sandwiches, many of us prefer soup rather than sandwiches…  Their is no need for you to apologize for anything…
Man, you opened the door and that room looked like a cathedral. Or maybe a giant sandwich shop. I’d like to order a Philly Cheesesteak, please. Thanks, Rudy!
c10
Hopefully bc your content is trash. 🤷‍♂️
No apology needed.  Do and live your life and if we can tag along, great.  If not, that's life too.
You just posted the other day 😅
sometimes it takes time to make money and sometimes it's not easy
hang in there you got this DUDE
I had an old man tell me once, excuses only satisfy the one that’s giving them. That was a wake up call for me. Maybe it will be for you too!
It's about time you got in a bigger shop. I want to see the Commanche get finished maybe at some point you'll get a J4500 or something. Keep it up Rudy will we here.
Starting out in most businesses is labor and time consuming - just keep at it and the rewards will come!
What you should do is switch to making videos full time…. Or at least temporarily to see how it goes, you got a good head start beign the son of Matt, i would take that opportunity and run with it, or go work with pop in the shop again while making the videos, it almost seems to me your trying to avoid going down that path, id walk right on down it no questions asked, im sure your mother and father would be supportive, or dont listen to me and just keep doing what you feel is the right thing to do
ill work for you but im in az did editing before and handy with tools
This just popped up. I am subscribed with the Bell and love all the stuff y'all do . Even the Lab guy's along with the list of off-road community. That shop looks like it's around Kanab . We had my wife's horse trained there . Beautiful area✓
So waiting for the C10 swap.
So in other words, you don't make enough money from doing this clown show. I don't blame you for stopping.
No apologies required.. take things at a pace that keeps you happy and stress free….
Adulting sucks.   No worries Rudy.  Always enjoy your content, however long it takes to come out.
I know where you are coming from. I've had the same problem all my life. Just do what you can and don't worry about the rest!
C10 content. I've been dying to see more. Congrats on the new shop!
The c10, I like to watch Colin smile
This just popped up on my Home Page to Watch.  After I watched the video I noticed it was from 1 yr ago. 🤦🏻‍♂️😁
Apology accepted now make me a P B & J sandwich as fast as possible. Actually, keep up the good work always look forward to your postings.
its ok ask your gf tampon\s are vubder sick get over it isnt it$$$$$$ come on balongana and toast wa wa WA
You're all good boss, don't sweat it
never apologise for the content you do, or do not, produce.
Take care of number one first, then when thats done, work on number two which is you, and remember God is always number one  so do the very best you can, so then this will apply to you, Philippians 4:13 King James Version 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.
🚨Maybe find an apprentice editor, they get the experience and recognition and help you out with editing your videos 💞
You are young and successes will come. Keep plugging along, do what you do well and don’t overload your emotional plate! Carry on sir!
I’ll take a BLT from Rudy’s Sandwich shop take your time Rudy it’s worth waiting for
Great job Rudy!  Keep up the great work.
great as always
You do you 🎉
Wishing you the best Rudy. Whenever you post a video I will watch it. My favorite project is the C 10 frame swap but do what is best for you.
Good going Rudy, looking forward to your content !
I Have faith in you.
If you do projects that you really want to do, I'm sure that passion will come across and help engage viewers. Interesting to you, is probably interesting to us. I will say that you and your brother compliment each other really well and we get Caulins funny, happy, self, with the easy going yet surprisingly accomplished fabrication expert, Rudy. 👍👍💯💯
Dont be sorry, your videos are great.. see ya at trail hero.. cheers.
Congratulations on new shop ! How far have you gotten on Collins C10 ?
Rudy you have manny loyal subscribers, one evert two weeks is fine.I use to watch 6 different channels I  subscribed to not any more. The push for two and three times a week and shorts was major over load, some content was getting boring. Im down too two. Your Dads and Robbie. I wish they would hold it down to two a week. Well what ever happens Im a fan, 🙂👍 I do watch others just not as often, I miss them but there is only so much time....Some times less is more, less shows and more/ or better content
Hey whatever to your brother's truck with the engine swap into frame swap I'll be waiting for the video of that
That couch looks familiar lol j/k  Keep up the good work congratulations on the new building and wish you the best of luck .
I can relate to the sandwich analogy! Well done and congrats on your new surprise 👊
Hey Rudy, it was a sad day when you left your dad's shop,but understandable...great to hear your expanding your horizons... and glad to hear your not quitting Youtubing ... ill watch and like your videos as you drop them 👍🙂👍 . Speaking of unfinished projects,  whatever happened with those tracks that you were manufacturing? Did i simply miss the videos, i thought i heard you barely mention that they were a  No go on another video way back ...  Ps if i was gonna go through all that work doing a body swap ,and especially in your family id think id want a 4×4 ...✌😄✌ oh well,i guess you can always change it later.😉 happy easter ,to all🐣🐣🐣
I know it's alot but I myself would love to see more.
thats true for all youtubers a simple task turns into a tedious one it just takes longer. you'll be able to speed up the content creation once you get used to editing or hire someone to do it.
Ahh yes.  The classic YouTuber apology video to get more clicks and make themselves seem more humble and human to their audience.
I guess you've joined the YouTube Click Baiters !
Let the shenanigans begin
Ah hell dont worry about it rudy, after all ..... your rudy🤨😐😑 but ah umm do you ever finish anything, anything, anything? lol
Love the positivity you have. Keep up the good work. I really enjoy your content.
Wow!
My daughter could do that. She has been a film major for like 3 years
youtube is weird ive been subed to you for awhile and today i was unsubscribed. the same thing happend yesterday. Shits frustrating.
I really dislike click bait videos - unsubscribed
Thanks for watching you sound so much like Matt.
Okay Rudy I will be watching you 😂 so you better be on your A Game 😮🎉
Rudi like others have said we will watch what you post nice shop buddy!!
I like the Comanche
Congratulations
What year C-10  is getting the Suburban frame?  I'm  interested  in that for  doing that on a 55-57 GMC - Chevy truck.
Good for you man! I'm having a hell of a time finding shop space in Phoenix.
Hey, I'm super excited about it. I'm looking forward to it. Keep doing that👌
My hats off to you Rudy!  There is a saying, "If you do what you love, you will never work a day in your life"  I'm not sure that's entirely true but it does ring true in a lot of ways.  When I was 16 I started wrenching and thought I would love to be a mechanic.  I worked a day job in an auto parts store and wrenched at night.  You said it "BURN OUT" .  I ended up eventually becoming an electrician and worked construction for about 17 years.  I moved up and behind a desk now, my kids are almost grown and You tube has become a great source of entertainment and information.  I have made several of my own videos, none of which are even close to the quality of the videos you and your Dad put out and only one has really even been a success.  The others all flopped and I have pulled them down.  I have done enough of them to know that like you said everything you do takes about 4 to 5 times longer when you video it yourself and do all of the editing.  I can sincerely appreciate your need to take a little break.  Good luck to you in all you do.  We only get one life to live so enjoy it and make it count.  Thanks for providing the entertainment and information.  I'll be watching!!!!!
RUDYS SANDWICH ANALOGY JUST CRACKED ME UP! HE IS SOOOO RITE THOUGH!
Is Rudy, Matt's son????
First; Videos that include :Teenage Girls" Get More Views... And; Don't get Married... Suggest you get a Plasma table and start selling "U-Weld it" prefab Bumper kits. Have the Lizzy Sisters Singers and Matts Off Road Quartet   "Do A Thing " at your Grand Opening...
Hey Rudy ! I show all your's vidéos, and the Matt's vidéo too ! I am in France (Rohan / Bretagne) and i like your region and above all your job and your atmosphere friendly ! Please, make vidéo for the plaisir for the fans !!! Merry Christmas !!!
That was cool. We'll  see how it goes.
This looks like a gigantic break for you. I agree with what someone else commented, don’t worry about the frequency of your posts, when you do we will be here to watch. Best of luck and hope it works out. I’ve watched you on your dad’s channel, I get the impression that you are frustrated and want to have something like this shop to show you are a skilled fabricator. That’s one humongous shop, which says to me Big Overhead plus setting up two bays….hope you have access to someone with deep pockets. Once again best of luck, you won’t lack for subscribers.
Anyone else thinking that if Rudy and Puddin’s Fabrication do the C-10 build in Collaboration it would be that absolutely business!  Best of luck to Rudy in the new shop.
Nice shop space!
Dude you do you! We'll be here. Do what you can. I get it. I have a W2 & side work. I can't imagine attempting to document it on top of it all.
𝕡𝕣𝕠𝕞𝕠𝕤𝕞
Congratulations , I'm new here but you will be hearing more from me and my friends as for unfinished projects show me how to finish I have a few and some dating back to the 1950s. Central California watching
Hey I understand but I don't work a short week like i work 120 hour a week  And still tried to make videos
hire Trevor since he got FIRED from your Dads
C10 and Rubicon
Good to see you're still around rudy, looking forward to seeing new content in your new shop congratulations.
We've missed ya!! ✌🐢
I love you man.
Do up a classic muscle car.Maybe a Trans Am!
Look forward to seeing many videos
You go Rudy will be watching
Awesome news! Big things ahead! Shop looks to have excellent potential. So glad that you are continuing, cant wait to see what is next!
A word of advise. Never back burner many projects for after retirement. They say you will have sooo much free time. Well not so, trust me. Some see I'm retired so fill in the blanks. Retirement is the best job I will ever have. Hey best of luck in your new place. Good video.
Life can be tough when trying to be successful. Keep focused on your goal and you will succeed.
Man I feel you on the editing, it takes many a hour of video to come up with 10 minutes of decent content!!!! And then to find the time to actually do it!
damn you... I was scared that you going to say something sad...   Well I wish you many happy and satisfied clients giving you money, and a lot of friends, and some best friends. Everyone needs them too. Do what you love to do!.
Rudy I am pretty sure everyone that watches wishes you nothing but the very best of luck on your new adventure!!! You need to take care of yourself as we who watch you will be here when your able to post a video!! 🤞🤞👀👏😂
Congratulations on the new digs.   But also, I understand when you talk about content. I have a very small channel, and it takes forever to be able to edit videos and attempt to create a storyline, and put everything together. Yes, you can get burnt out fast, Im attempting to get my kids involved to help with the editing and storyline. .   Keep up the great work and mainly keep it real. Folks will follow you for that..
Finish the Comanche becuz the Rudicon will always be a tinkering project.   You don't need to go Sarah on it, just finish it to your taste and move on.  Then do Caulin's truck, same deal.  Then move on to whatever you fancy.  We'll all be happy with whatever production you can manage.  Oh, and can the clickbait titles....
We super enjoy your show!
Check out Puddins Fab Shop here on youtube. He does very similar work like what you are looking to do with Colin's Truck.  Frame swap and new power train to old body. He has at least 3-4 lowered airbag set up vehicles.  His Travelall, his Shop truck and even one of his mintrucks.  Super fun channel to watch.
Your doing great Rudy  👍. Keep crankin out these vids. It's informative and entertaining. Roll with it dude.
I would love to see you finish the Comanche because you are so close to being done. I think your brothers swap is going to be a bit longer than you think, I could be wrong. With the Comanche and what ever you have to do on the Rudicon you could then focus on the Burb swap.
Hope tge future is as bright for you as it has been for you dad
I’m excited for the Comanche build. Don’t burn out. Drop back to one video a month and work up.
4x4 swap Colin's c10
It's safe to say that the Comanche is the new 1/2done right ????
I can’t whettoo see all three, but Rodicon done. Your great Rudy. Congratulations on your new shop space.
You're doing a great job. Just don't spread yourself too thin and prioritize your effort.
No the money's to good to believe your last video is now just a sad attempt to get views is what it feels like
I want to see a dropped lowered C10. That is going to be sick! I've never been much of an off-road-er but enjoy builds and can appreciate it all non-the-less. But I haven't seen a good drop build yet and that is something I wanted to do with my mini truck years ago.
You do what you need to do.    The sad fact is that a lot of people don't realize that unless they have done video/movie production, too often people don't realize -- let alone register -- the fact that it can take several hours of raw filming to get the material together and from 30 - 60 minutes per minute of completed content.  More if it's a completely CG production.  And given you admitted to two jobs and turning into a one-man operation, being a YouTube Content Creator can be overwhelming to a near constant threat of burn out.    Good luck and I'll keep an eye out for you in the future 👍
Intelligent people don't need great content.   Intelligent people want ideas or to see examples of other's path to finishing their own ideas.    I think the drive to create "content" whatever that means (let's just say it means a video) will divert anyone who does that from truly focusing on their work.  If your work is "content" then, of course, do that.  However, being overly concerned with "content", what other's think, expectations, view count, is likely one sure path to distraction, and likely, if not failure, then finished products that are less than what they could really be.   Do great work, a little video summary is enough.   I didn't watch much of this video because none of it was substantial, you were talking about content, kind of a waste of time.
Will continue following you!
Молодец растешь, свое дело это круто. тебя приятно смотреть!
Really waiting for the Rudycon to be lookin all pimp.....do it.
Comanche!  I've loved that vehicle ever since they first came out.
It’s good that you recognized your burn out . Now you get too move forward just pace yourself! We love the content
Yay!!!!! Now hurry up!!! 🙂
OK Rudy & brother!
Woooooo hooooo!!!
So did you leave your other job to focus on creating more content? Thus the new place and all that?
Comanche
Truly RAD!  Congrats!😊
And you are going to ruin the c10
Cant wait for more Rudi's adventures!
Life happens.  Making a living is more important than making videos.  One pays the bills to keep a roof over your head. One pays for toys.  Love the videos, make them as you have time. Hopefully you can get the videos to pay more of the bills. If you can make a living doing what you love  you will never work a bad day.
Producing “content” consistently , ultimately results in an empty life, regardless of the monetary benefits. It’s not sustainable long term.
Once a week is good, even if it is just a 1 minute video to say you haven't done much this week!
Do what must you do, we still support you Rudi 💪
I'm stoked on you gaining access to that shop, it looks incredible. However I'll just out and say it, clickbait titles will get an unsubscribe from me fairly quick. They're completely unnecessary and I find them truly annoying and unprofessional. It's like have an univited solicitor show up at your house and start ringing the doorbell and knocking on the door while you're trying to take a nap. 😄
Welcome back!  Thank you for continuing to include us in your adventures. (This way cool things are accomplished and my fingers stay warm and clean.) 🦊Riki2Tails
Rudy, good luck with your new shop space! Sounds like a lot of great content coming as your channel evolves.  And no need to ever apologize. It's an imperfect world, shoot for 100% and be very happy with 85%.
You could rent this out for wintertime drone racing leagues...
Couple of good ol Utah boys
good for you! Love the videos
Where is your girl?
So it’s not your last video?
Starting your own business ! May your adventure succeed ! Fixing up vehicles !? GV ! 🔧👨‍🏭🛠
The c 10 for sure, keep up the good work Rudy!!!
Keep them comming Rudy!  Looking forward to it.
Congratulations. You show growth and proper way of thinking. Fingers Crossed. Good Luck.
Is this my last Video?   Seen alot of these last fake videos teasers......I;m like  live up to it and QUIT !!!!!
Finish the Commanche!
When faced with multiple tasks, ..the one to do first, is the one for which you have the required material already in stock. It gets frustrating if you are working something, and have to stop, to wait for a shipment. Best way, on multiple tasks, is to only strip the one you work on first, thus saving space, and no parts are misplaced in confusion. Stay inspired, by having enough sleep, and eating regular good food .....if you are awake with a great idea early, have a book and pen handy, to pen down, or record a voice note.
Appreciate your update, and you keeping the content the focus point. Many channels, tend to make long content, by adding long driving time to their channels. Driving time, without constructive talk, gets subscriptions deleted. What happens is they post each video with similar driving time sections, mostly on the same route as previous content. The active content, is why why watch, ...to learn things, and share the different spectrum and insights which we find worthwhile.. The frequency of videos posted is not important, but the quality of content, is what keeps subscribers hanging on. In every workshop, the time frame to completion is flexible to a certain extent, but the quality of what I'd done, is what keeps the doors open.  All people make mistakes, but respect is earned, by attempting to correct what ever is lacking.  When content is scarce, involving people related to your tasks improves and inspires following the channel. When building something different, we often gain improved ideas as we work.  Stay inspired, as before you know what happens, you start running low on space. In two years, you will be choosing the clients, because you can only do so much at a time.
Hang in there dude!! We have a small channel and 100% understand personally what you are going thru and feeling. It can all be so overwhelming especially when you are trying to live real life as well. Don’t put so much pressure on yourself!! Decide to work on one video per week and hit that goal. Once you are in the groove and feel you can add a 2nd then do that! You have the following, that’s half the battle. People will watch you just have to find a schedule that doesn’t overwhelm you. Otherwise you will start to hate it bc of the undue stress you are putting on yourself and we would all hate to see you walk away bc of that! Give yourself some grace man!
Congratulations!!
You clearly have skills and motivation. You need to work on making your videos less narration and more content. Watching you talk while driving is too much of the video.
Shop set-up videos make great content.
Go and get it!
thanks man for the heads up, congrats on  the new space
Hey Rudy, A bit of advice I have offered to a LOT of channels(most of them video game news) where the posters get very ENGROSSED in if they are posting often enough, OBSESSED with the quality of their content, ENSLAVED by how much of their life they have to share, and how often.... that's all NONSENSE, man.  YOU be YOU.  That's the only real requirement of a successful channel.  Folks watch other folks on Youtube because their lives are different from our own. Because we like to watch THEM, be THEM, instead of us, doing what we do. It's a change of pace, something new and different.   NEVER forget: Your subscribers are NOT your customer, and we sure as hell are not your BOSS. Sure you make money off of clicks and engagement, but WE PAY NOTHING.  You therefore DO NOT OWE US ANYTHING.   Don't lose sight of that. If you do, it will start driving you nuts. Crazy enough to start a video with an APOLOGY! (No man, not required, never was, stop doing that 😁).  Think about it THIS way: Why in the WORLD would you feel the NEED to PROVE to US(of all people) that you can complete a project? 1. Why would we think anything different - your skills in fab are ridiculously beyond 99% of all of your AUDIENCE(AUDIENCE, not Customer, not Boss) 2. Why should you CARE what we think? We are here because we enjoy your content. Watching your content benefits US. And most of us pay NOTHING for it. 3. So I suggest you take a deep breath and relax a bit and really ponder WHY you feel you need to PROVE yourself to US. WE do not matter. What you do is interesting to us, so we watch.... that's it. It's THAT UNCOMPLICATED. There is no part of this relationship where YOU owe US anything. And why would there be?  My 2 cents.
Do what you want to do, enjoy your life, don't get burnt out by working too many hours. Rome wasn't built in a day. Film what you want, share what you want. We'll be here. We are patient. We are not sitting at the edges of our chairs waiting for content for you. We will stay subscribed. You're young, you have many directions you can go. Focus on what makes you happy, not what you feel you have to do. But then again, there is a balance of responsibility as well, to yourself, and later to your family (wife and kids) if that happens. But really, if you don't enjoy what you do. If you don't wake up in the morning excited to do it, then keep your eyes open for the next thing, or a different direction. Just because you CAN make money with videos doesn't mean you SHOULD. On the other hand, if you enjoy the challenge, and can tolerate the 45 minute sandwich (more like an hour and a half lol), go for it. And I will give you this piece of advice. People don't watch the videos JUST to see an interesting truck rebuild. We watch it because we like the people who are doing it. You could walk your dog on a nature trail and we would enjoy it. You could make a clip from a coffee shop having breakfast and we would enjoy it. Because you are likeable and have charisma. You are interesting and fun. So just shoot anything, and everything, and it doesn't have to be a 5 star quality production to be uploaded. That comes with practice, not by filtering. I enjoyed this vid as much as anything. It was like seeing an old friend. Just DO IT. if that is what you want to do. And by all means get some help if you need it. Don't feel like you have a quota. And don't worry about the quality or the money. Just post fun shit for fun. The quality improves with iterations.  Don't be so hard on yourself.  Databyter
Hang in there Rudy. We will always watch your videos. Someday you'll be larger than Matts Off Road.
Look forward to the C10 project of Collin's,  we will just have to be patient and wait for the videos,  Its all about the quality content not about the crappy videos every day.  Keep being awesome Rudy. Thanks from Canada ah! :)
Got you if you need a good editor man!
Good luck. You can do what ever you put your mind to. 💯
No worries my guy been wondering where you been. No apologies do your thing you will figure out what works and when it works for you. We are here brotha to stay.
I am pushing to finish my camper build! I would love to come out and lend you a hand getting it done! I've got a similar background and skillset , and always want to learn and create! Good to see you chasing your own thing!
Bagged C10.
If the new content has a generic pair of pants mentioned 15 times in one video. Like some of your other videos I’ll pass.
Good luck
I was wondering why you stopped making videos. Glad to see you have such a huge shop area now. Are you going to do recovery's? Are you going to take in cars and trucks and repair it modify them? Good luck and keep us posted.
So the ultimate sandwich build video coming soon?
Good luck!!
Every 2 hour project becomes an all weekend event when you are trying to be a solo youtuber.  Most keyboard warriors with the negative comments have no idea.  Keep up the good work Rudy.
Hi buddy happy thanksgiving!!! I’m glad you are able to expand and have your own space, it’s nice to be able to do your own thing. I’m looking forward to all your builds, I’m learning so much from you, your pop and fabrats. I’m sure glad I found you all. Please take care be safe and GOD bless you and the fam.
Some of the best advice I ever read was about a guy that tossed social media, stopped kissing its butt made his own web page/domain and allowed him time to just provide what he wanted to do for people.  Food for thought.    article by Dave Morrow where I read that and it's pretty straightforward
Congratulations Rudy!
missed you mate
GOTTA FINISH THE RUDYCON !  And yes finding a good video editor is hard , especially one you can work with . love the new work shop , looks like plenty of work space.
Good luck fella, No matter what you do just enjoy what you have....👍
What do you mean it's not a good analogy he had my attention I love sandwiches
C10 🙏🏼
Rudy, im a video editor. If you need one. Contact me!
Always take the time to yourself when needed man it's needed some days we just need to reset . Always love the content and how you have branched out in your own ways among having a badass dad and crew behind you and you will always have me as a fan! Here on YouTube whoop whoop haha ... If your down with the clown cheers Rudy
Love ya man! Can’t wait for your expansion!
I can't ammagen how overwhelming to putting a video together and feeling that you have people wanting to see more videos.  You need a break so don't be hard on yourself. God bless
Don’t let worry you Rudy, take your time we will be here.
Old Chevy truck.
Awesome!!!
Looking so forward to it Rudy! You're doing great!
Don't worry, us true fans will always tune in when you post new stuff 👍👍👍good luck with your new shop🤞🤞🤞
I'll be here watching when you, or other people I genuinely enjoy watching, post videos.
I like PBJ, non chunky. Thank you for "Really" telling the truth about creating videos. I will follow and hang back for your next episode.
Congrats on ur own place
OMG!!!  As a content provider, I will tell you that most people have no idea how much work is involved in making content here.  That's a great analogy: For every minute of finished video, there's 20 minutes of preparation, and editing, and finishing, including uploading,and then attending to comments.  Having a YT channel IS a full time job.  You're doing great.  Pace yourself.  If you post even ONE per week, that's still a good track record.   We love you Rudy. Thank you for your efforts, and that which you DO do.  It's difficult to juggle so many things at once :)
C10 frame swap gets my vote. Keep it Rollin, as a rolling stone gathers no moss.
Rudy, love that your back. I really missed you. Good luck with your channel. I definitely be watching.
C10 !!!!
complete the Rudicon.. ;-)
Keep going!
Comanche, C10, Rudicon its all good.
Who needs a Lizzy???/she is cute and can weld pretty good....but u have a J9 and J9's are cool too...
you can do this Rudy!!!Caulin and Rosie! or whatever her name is...
Gonna be epic... I feel it.
Please go for the C10 it's a classic
No worries Rudy! We aren't going anywhere.
I will watch anything u post.  I really enjoy everything u post so I’m good.
And the sandwich must be good.😊
Finish the Rudicon first!! First in first dun.
This YouTube stuff is a lot of work. I have been slacking too and am getting myself back on track.
Rudy.  Rome was not built in a day son.  Just keep at it when you can.  In time your channel will grow and you will find new ways to do your vids.  I know I am not the only that miss seeing you.  Just do what you can mate and dont overdo things.  Regards and all the best.
בהצלחה רודי .
Yeah Rudy---Go Rudy Go---I was concerned youd done a Watch JR. Go shop---too big, to loud, to expensive.  You didn't GREAT!!!
I've enjoyed everything you've done between both channels, and I also get the analogy lol I've been making solo shorts for over a year now for the same reason....
Hey Rudy love watching you content when you get it out,w e all know it's not easy doing it by yourself..keep on plugging though..
Attaboy Rudy!
That's just going to ruin an antique truck by putting all that newer computerized junk in it
I like the Comanche
Hej Rudy, No problems. Give us videos when you can. DON´T burn out again. I have been there and it is NOT good. Take care and God bless you Rudy.
Good job my baby boy
Just glad to see you making more videos and content.  No love lost here, well done Rudy!!! That dang work thing gets in the way all the time ha ha ha ha
cool man nice shop wish i has one lol one day i will
Relax man!   It is all about honesty, loyalty and doing the right thing.   We see you!
🌴Wow!  awesome workspace. Congrats! 💚
Sounds great Rudy. Good luck on your new adventure.
Conratulations Rudy;..new digs, new projects,   2023 will be a great year....!
Finish the XJ, then poke at both of the trucks.   Don't quit your day job, don't over extend, and give us what you can when you are able. Love the content.
Better 1 really good video a month, one 3 bad ones, make them your thanks because they're so good :D
You are doing a great job, enjoy the new workshop and keep your cool. Always good to get a sneak peak of your jam-packed life.
Gllad to see you back. looking forward to more content. Um I vote C-10 first even though I am a Mopar guy.
Looking forward to the C10 build!
Your Mom & Dad should be proud, you are quite a young man who is getting his sh*t together! Look forward to more content!
Okay c’mon… don’t be the guy that makes these clickbait titles…
Put bays and tools in the new shop and rent repair spaces out to those who want to fix their vehicles but don't have a space and money for a shops labor .
This is the life we live. Struggle is where we grow the most. Keep on truckin'
Regardless Rudy, we will keep watching… You make good videos!…. give me more RUDICON
I'd like to see the C-10 done first!
Comanche
well done RUDY your new workshop  looks fantastic and look forward to your new content   from David of  New Zealand
The Rudicon's real name is the "½ DUN"!!! I call it the "½ DUN" when I see it in videos!
Good space and new shop, wish you all the best and as a tradesman with many years of fabrication using different mediums, I can say unreservedly that you have a lot of skill and talent, some that we have seen and some yet to be tapped. More strength to your arm Rudy.
Rudy, you are in an extremely good place to launch to 1MM subs...  Invest the money now in the support staff and start cranking out content..  People need to see new vids frequently to stay interested..  You have 200k subs already and an existing platform (transitioning from Matt's Offroad)..  It's a wasted opportunity if you let this pass..  Just my $0.02.
Now I want a sandwich Hunter
You guys should do some suspension work on my Ford fuckin ranger 4x4 EDGE
You make it, we'll watch and appreciate it. 👍
Way to go Rudy and little brother.👍🏽👍🏽🙏🏽.🙋🏽‍♂️😊😎💪🏽🦃. Good luck bud.
Do you guys have a happy Thanksgiving I hope you guys are doing well I’m doing well but I just can’t work on things like that I was a master mechanic can do most of my hand Is messed up my left hand I can’t do much like I used to I do what I can when I got to do the work for the lotto more than one hand can do but you guys have a happy Thanksgiving
I want sandwiches!
C10/Suburban
Rudy I've got your back and I don't care about your clickbaiting title😅😅
Just an idea maybe you should collab with Robby on hillbilly’s bornxtar 😮
Love to follow the c10!
SWEET, Rudy doesn't have a restroom in his office anymore.
Good to see you back in the saddle.. Looking forward to seeing the project through..
Thanks for the update. Keep them coming!!!!!!!
I work 60 hrs a week.. ill watch what ever you put out. Keep rolling . From way up north in saskatchewan!! TTFN
We good! With a full time job a n Door Dash at night (drive for wife) I'm fully aware how long it's takes to make a dang sandwich.
Big fan of the "brother truck" but would like to see the Comanche doner too. Rudicon will always be 1/2 Dun
I think your doing great. Hang in there.
Look forward to seeing more..I like when channels start out content is pure..not all fancy..and you’re for the working man ideas that most of us can relate too..
How about the good looking young lady that has been riding with you?
Here when you are Rudy, keep up the good work, congratulations on the building.
Really liking your vids hate to see you stop making content! Good luck Rudy
Can't wait to see all three projects
Rudy you are doing awesome would love to see the C10 done and then the Rubicon for some great recoveries
Thank you sir. Watch your cash flow and time spent. I know you will be a bigger success. Lets just make it a steady incline. Peace
You're going to install a toilet in the office, right? Right?
Well,  Since you apologized,  I guess we will still watch.  Thanks for the Updates Rudy!
Love what you do! Keep up the great work. Share when you can. See you soon.
I like sandwiches.
Rudicon is my vote!
Filming and editing is a huge job unto itself. Small steps bro.
Life is full of choices man when u get the channel going good u take a chance and quit ur day job and then do YouTube full time
I'm just glad you didn't give up!! No question you got fab skills, and you inherited Matt's improvisation skills I'm sure. If you don't know how to do something, ask your army of subscribers. I've worked in all parts of a big sheet and saw stock metal fabrication company for 12 years.
You just whine and complain and nobody is interested in what you are doing,give up
We miss ya Rudy and will support ya no matter what!
I look forward to following your adventure in this new chapter . It is easy for us fans to loose sight of the fact that you have another full time life . Keep up the good work . Oh and you definitely can call them skills .
Really want to eat another sandwich..
good to see that you  have your priority's right. don't overload yourself. on the builds i love to see them all but maybe best to start with the one that's the most easy
Time for a haircut bud  I look forward to see what you are doing build wise
Why not have your dad fulfill some of "those gaps" since you are fortunate and have family that funds your dreams and offers stepping stones?  You sound a bit privileged how you feel you are a victim when in reality you are fortunate..
Rudy, it's good to see you growing into your dream!
ROCK ON RUDY WILL BE HERE TO FOLLOW, ONE STEP AT A TIME AND YOU'LL BE FINE. GOOD FOR YOU ⚡⚡ 👍👍😀👌✌️
We all have  our own lives to live, and    if that means  you can't  relate a new video  every week,  so be it,  your content has always  been top notch  and   regardless of how long it is between  video releases,  you have to live your  life too
Who’s shop is it and how does having your own place help your situation if you still have to work for the other guy? Sounds Millennial to me  Ready fire aim  thats the UTAH gang way except for Rory and Sean and Mike  GO TrailMater
You be in JAIL ?????
Certainly have missed your presence.  Glad to see that you are spreading your wings and broadening your abilities.  You are a very smart, talented person and I am sure you will do well in all you attempt.  Glad to see you back.  Take care.
Cool video!!   I wish you guys would build a sick off-road Suburban!!!  😊
Maybe Rudy can learn how to get projects done by following the progress on Matt's big wrecker.  Anyway, there's no shortage of YouTube videos to entertain us.  For instance, lopping slices off cows' hooves and watching cops chase speeders.
Your content is awesome man. We know you work hard at what you do to entertain us so the amount of videos don't matter we just love watching you. That being said can't wait to see more. Keep it up. And by the way the Comanche was the best in my opinion.
This is RAD, lol, I look forward to your content.  Keep winning Rudy.
congrats
Well Brother, as many viewers have also stated, I truly appreciate the work you do. The community that has been built and continues to grow with all of these channels has been so exciting to be a part of. Thank you and stay safe My Friend!!!!!
Love your analogy…. Feel your pain Brother. Keep on grinding !
Don't' worry about being too busy to upload Rudy. . makes it even more of a pleasure watching when you do.
Be careful with the quality over quantity thing. There must be a learning curve for working, talking, & recording all at the same time. For years, actually decades I was the man BEHIND the camera & the keyboard, filming & editing as a hobby & community service. I liked doing that & felt that I was good at it but it does take a lot of time, especially if you are a perfectionist. I would like to do more DIY & review videos but being in front of the camera rather than behind it hasn't come together. Looking out at about 2' of snow, feeling the aches & pains of clearing snow, and watching this video, maybe I need to come & help you.
Can't wait..keep your dream going..it will payoff..
Busy beaver you are! The new shop looks good, you just might need half of that huge shop too. I want to see "1/2 dun Rudicon" become "3/4 dun Rudicon" I notice that have been working on or helping with Holly's new jeep too. Keep posting!
Pretty cool Rudy! You take care and don't try to do too much. And look out, that bit at the end; your about to be the adult in the room. 😀
Take it slow and take breaks. No editing is better & hope you find an camera man/editor!
We love all your videos man, Not the frequency. One awesome video like this every so often beats trash uploaded posting ever day
Stop selling yourself short Rudy. A project is never finished when it comes to an offnroad rig. You put one tons under a cherokee, put shocks through the hood, big tires, cut the roof out, built a cage. Then took it wheeling all over utah. You are living my dreams. I wanna come halp.
Keep calm young man, and take your time. We are patient people, and will gladly wait for the good stuff. C`grats on the new building. Greets from Denmark.
Glad to see you back. Will be anxiously waitng to see more stuff. Can't  wait. Good to see ya buddy.
Good on ya Rudy! Don't stress it. Have some fun.
I was click baited when i read is this your last video ‘ya got me’
C10
Colin’s c10
Thanks for checking in. I love me some classic heavy Chevy, but they’ll all be fun!
LETS GO !
That's awesome congratulations 👏 🎊
Rootin' for ya' Rudy !  It's in your blood, man !   You learned from the best.  Make the right decisions and you will be golden because you have what it takes.
Keep going,you're in the rotation!
Just growing pains, Rudy, no worries! You'll find your rhythm! We love ya in Vermont?
Explanation wasn't really necessary. Good to see you back. Would love to see the Rudicon 3/4 dun. Lol
Once your vids with click bait titles get a majority of its views change the title so it can reach even further
Super excited about any content you put out man! Continue to show us those outside adventures too don’t sit in the shop for every video!
He'll yea
my interests are comanche then cherokee
That's OK Rudy, I don't mind Not having a sandwich now and then... I need to lose my little bulgy belly anyways!  🤣 Yer a good guy and I'm sure yer adventures will be interesting and fun as always! ✌
"Enjoy every sandwich." -- Warren Zevon
I love your work take your time
The best advice I've ever heard is to never turn your hobby into a job. We will watch your videos when you post them. I've watched you grow up on your dad's channel since the very first video. You have a lot of fans out there from his channel. Just make sure you love what you do.
C’mon! Don’t ever scare me like that again! I’m so excited for you!
Congratulations Rudy  keep up the great work but don’t burn yourself out.
😬
Keep up the good work Rudy . Your up to over 200 K subscribers already . I have seen many people with a great deal less than that over quite a longer time frame . You will be a success .
We can’t all be YouTube stars. I’m not sure why you’d want too?
Is the shop that you mention that you used to work at a couple years ago, Matt's (Off Road Recovery) or any relationship to that place? (I think most of us know you from there, at least I do.)
sandwich analogy is legit!  I totally get that.  I have all these things I want to film and post.  Yet, the time it takes to film while doing (moving cameras, narrating, etc), then edit....just sooo much time when working on my own, I just end up not filming it.  Plus working a day job...the struggle is real!  Congrats on the new shop space!  I can't wait to build my new shop :)  <---speaking of that content lol.
Good for you Rudy congrats.
RUDICON!  Collin's frame swap will be great, but the Rudicon has been on the back burner for a loooonnnnnngggggggg time.  Congratulations on the new space.
Glad to have you back.
New shop looks awesome.  No worries about dropping off for a bit, everyone needs time to figure things out.  Real life work comes first, YouTube and the people on it come second.  I know there is money to be made but you have to have balance.  I would love to see the Rubicon finished, but honestly the C10 is my favor of the three you have started.  Have a great holiday.
C10
We all have lives too, we get it, haha. Your stuff is good enough that your fans will be here whenever you want to put stuff out. Don't stress about the schedule or think you need to put videos out every couple days like MORR does.  My favorite thing you're doing is the Rudicon. It's been 1/2 DUN for...is it years? It would be awesome to see it all dun!
Its TIME, OH Yes Its TIME for the Rudicon to be All DUN. BTW If you need Rudy's little editing  helpers, Isn't that what little brothers are for. Especially little brother with FREE trucks😉
Time management is a major issue for everybody. The more ambitious you are the harder it gets. Rudy you need to do a video that shows what you might want to accomplish for each project, start by writing it out on paper first. Writing solidifies ideas somewhat. Then tackle one at a time. - Best of Luck Man. Don't underestimate your skill set.
I live in Colorado City this is awesome congratulations man🎉
Rudy. Love the content even if it spaced out. Keep up the great quality work.
Hi.
Meh, do what you want.  But this yt stuff may not last forever... if you can make a dollar might as well.  1thing you can count on is google will change shIt
Just to let you know man I'm a huge fan of yours. I love your personality I think you're a good dude. But as a business owner I would encourage you to realize the blessing of 200,000 followers that you basically got overnight and I know you're grateful for that. But try to team up with someone get a sponsor let them know that you're going full time and maybe they can give you $1,000 a week to start. And hire one of your brothers to do all the editing. With you overseeing it. Dude by this time next year you'll have 300,000 followers. No boss. You really don't owe your boss as much as you think. He is a businessman.
Only three unfinished projects? amateur :)
Yeah Rudy we all know life comes at you fast. Put videos out when you can...make living your life priority number 1. Keep putting Otis in the vids. He seems like a cool dog.
Kinda want a sandwich now
👍
I know exactly how you feel, as I am newly inspired YouTuber (By influence of You Guys) and it is very difficult to manage a full time job, A family, Projects, Recording, and Editing.  I 100% fel your pain, and I am excited for your new shop as well as your dedication!!  I helps in more ways then you know!!   #BuiltByBo
You are at almost a quarter of a MILLION Subscribers. I'd say you're doing a pretty bang up job (especially considering you're making sandwiches by yourself) Take us on your adventures and we'll be entertained. Any one of your projects are fine to go with, but the Rudicon had been here the longest ;-).  You keep posting and we will keep liking.
Thanks, Rudy for sharing your future plans, looks and sounds great!  J.R.
RUDY... We 💕 and have missed you!! Finish your Bros truck first!!  He'd love you forever!!  LOL Great to see you're back!
Keep it coming! My vote is on the c10
Man what a brother. Imagine your brother gets you your dream truck. THEN he is going to help you frame swap it too. Amazing friend/brother Rudy! Your brother will talk about these stories his entire life no matter what he goes and does.
Would be nice to see you celebrate taking the 1/2 Dun label off the Rudicon!
Congratulations on the new shop. Keep up the great work  Oh and I like the C10 as a starter
So excited and happy for you. I have a 1999 jeep Cherokee sport 2 wheel drive I’m currently working on
Thanks for the update. Looking forward to seeing what you get up to in the new shop.
You have to do what you have to do and sometimes the choices are hard. Just keep being awesome and it will work out in the end.
Missed you more videos you are not going anywhere 😅
Looking forward to seeing more from you 👌
Stop at the Barbershop!!!  Glad you are back in some capacity. Heard you were going to help Matt. Great Shop, pace yourself and your activities.
Hey ! Take care of yourself first and foremost. You produce great videos that are REAL. !
Keep pounding Rudy. Sometimes, less is more.
Love ya brother but please drive while driving, put the camera down, concentrate on driving, very dangerous and it might not be you that gets hurt or killed, I don’t like distracted driving!
Cool.  I want to see more of that commanche and the C-10.  All will be good.
congrats Rudy!
YO! I totally understand! We've got the same situation. It truly is hard to balance it all.  Working full time job and creating content then editing it all. It just keeps piling up. Heck! I still have yet to post the first 3 videos of mine because of time and unfinished projects. (I started from watching your dad and wanting to do the same). It'll all get going and we all understand and look forward to the journey!
I'll watch them when you post them.  :)   If I had my way, I'd like to watch the comanche get built.
Great vid, keep it up and love the new shop!
Congratulations on the new shop !  I always enjoy your videos but most of all your positive, uplifting attitude!  Keep up the good work !
Go Get'em Rudy! We're here for you. Now go finish the Rudicon!!
So what is the time frame on a channel were we are supposed to do the "I'm leaving Youtube.....?" video?
Pull in Skeeter and Trevor!  I don't know what happened to them, but they were great.
I recognized that town as you drove to your shop.  I drove all over that place trying to find someplace to eat.  Definitely a unique part of the USA.  Very pretty.
Rudy! Holy smokes man. It's super awesome to see you branching off on your own like this. I'm sure it's a TON of work but you are doing incredible stuff. Keep it up!
Family first. Nothing more important than your wife and a healthy directionally correct life! Fit your posts in around these two priorities!
just glad to see your still alive these thing don't happen over night but cant wait to see new videos
Awesome new location, looking forward to seeing how you use it. Take your time making the videos, having less but better content at first will go a lot farther than more more but not as good. Once you get your feet under you it'll all come together and you'll be able to make more content and still keep the quality high. I enjoy watching all of your builds but have to be honest and say I am looking forward to seeing what you do with the Comanche the most.
Lovely location.  You couldn't ask for a nicer community to work in.  Plus, you are so much closer to visit Paul at FabRats.
1 Comanche 2 jeep 3 truck build
Thanks for the heads up.  Frequency and quality are two different things. I've been watching since the Morrvair build and you've never been a let down. Woo-hoo! New Shop!
Awesome, I can't wait. I'm ready to see some c10 videos.
Finish the Rudicon!  😅
Was wondering where you went! Glad you’re back!
Just remember you can never be the man if your working for the man.
Sounds like Rudy works at subway.
Well done! Onwards and upwards Rudy. Don’t fret about the video production. You are putting together a great place to do great things and showcase your skills and enthusiasm. The videos when they come will tell the story.
I would like to see the Comanche finished, then rudicon, and c10.
Finish the Comanche
Sandwiches?  Now I’m hungry!!
i like all the builds
C10. For Sure.
As Always Rudy your content is always worth the wait. Well done mate. Good luck in the new shop. Look forward to seeing future projects.
Cool, you have a shyster!  Lol. Meaning your fork lift. Keep it up dude!
You build it they will come!
Looking forward to it!!
How does having more space give you more time xD  But if you figure it out let me know, I’m kinda into that more time thing :D
Yahoo nice building that’s cool. Glad to see everything is OK!!! Rudy we thought something was wrong. So this will make thing’s easier, we hope .God Bless
Can't wait to see Colin's truck done.
Let’s see that Comanche get finished up!
I love sandwiches 🥪
Great video
I’m stoked. I like your style and imagination. This channels RAD
commaannnccchhheeeeeeeee
Nice new work area.
Great to hear from you again, I was holding my breath 🤣, new you'd be back The new shop looks great 👍👍, sooon
I’m most excited about the Comanche build
Quality content is always worth the wait.
Go getem!
Glad to see you will keep posting!
Good to see you're getting up n at it, with a bigger shop.  Keep up the good work.  Your dad is going to be jealous soon!
Rudy, I'm super excited, I'm subscribed, so keep on keeping on.  Stu from Australia
Congratulations Rudy cant wait to see your progress! Keep doing what you do
I've been wondering where you have been? I still very much miss you on Matt's off-road recovery you have a positive an awesome personality a very likable guy. Keep your head to the grindstone and if this is what you like doing then do it all good things take commitment and keep your eye on the prize. Is Janelle taking too much of your time?
is the young lady still helping you as she seemed to be on the right wave link with what was happening?
I think there is scam being used in comments. FYI
?
Need to adult some times, really sucks doesn’t it. Glad your back.
We got it Rudy just work on your time management we all know it takes a lot of time editing your videos, wow what a shop good for you Rudy we are behind you 100% Rudy, just try to get one video out a week and use that as your goal to work towards!
Congrats Rudy that's a bunch of great surprises. Best of luck to you and your boss with the new space. Thanks for the update and content.
good for you Rudy.....good luck.....
Quality over quantity, bud! Life happens, we all get swamped with half done projects and get burned out. Looking forward to some new content!
Comanche
Build all three!
Keep up the work young man at first I was not too confused with your channel and I made that statement but your content has gotten better  a suggestion to you put out one video a month for now you already have the backing of many of mats off-road where you started but you have created your own channel and I do appreciate the differenceI really need to see the finish of the Apache you called a C10 I have had two of those trucks wish I wouldn't have gotten rid of either one of them loving the Ride along like in the famous Adam Sandler movie you can do it you can do it
You got to do what's right by you Rudy. Take it at your own pace. Wow! That will be a nice shop. I wish you luck at both your jobs and we'll be here for you all the way.
Comanche
Finish the C10! I’m eager to see how it drives with the Vortec and modern frame and suspension.
Rudy I'm it takes a lot of time money and sacerfice to give us veidos to watch don't over work yourself bro and thank you for your veidos buddy
You had me at jeep comanche! = )
I would like to see you finish the Rudicon first
How ever long it takes I'll be sticking around.   The Comanche
hi rudi so what town is your new shop in are you far from your dads place ???? good luck to you from australia.
Congratulations on your new facility !
cant wait to see the commanche done.... stay tough.
Title:  Response:  Who tf r u, dime a dozen youtubers in USA, no wonder the world hates you. Please make this your last.
Paradoxically, sometimes you've got to be what seems a little bit selfish and take care of your own needs to be able to be in a space so you can look after and help others and family, at least that's what some kind of expert told us at a large company I once worked for, which seems about right. If you try and please everybody else first, then you may wind up in a position you can't help anybody - so the good news is you'll actually genuinely be doing everyone who cares about you and you care about a favour if you spend a bit more time looking after the needs and wants of numero uno.  : )  My vote is mostly work on the C-10 till it's dun, then Rubicon, then Comanche - nice expectation marketing making the Comanche pic so small in the vid I see what you did there.  Also Kaulin should get roped in 100% while you do the C-10, so some synergies there for at least some help on the tools. I was going to suggest Robbie would love to paint it when it's done, but seem to recall Kaulin wanted it au naturale, which seems a fair call.  P.S. One day one of you Utah YouTubers will figure out that if you put a large double glaze window in the shop with a view onto some of those hills people will spend 20 minutes watching you tie your shoelaces twice a week if you do it in front of the window.  Or put your Barnes/HarbourFreight unboxing table there and just order and unbox stuff in the window, LOL. Alternatively, just work outside when you can in Spring and Fall etc with the view in the background. BTW the channel was already perfect, it'll only get better if you enjoy making changes and you guys do seem genuinely excited by the new workshops spaces which is great to see - when do we see the R K Adventure & Design (RKAD) signage going up to halve your workload? ; )
The mj is an easy fave for me bc my grandpa had one when I was a kid and I  hope to get one one day. Also love any xj content cuz I've had 3
Good luck and have fun Rudy. Make it you. 🇨🇦
Bro. Your own bay ?  LETS GOOOOOO !!!!   Commence living the dream
Bro when ya wanna post , post.  When ya wanna do  other stuff, do other stuff.  Mercia’
Comanche BUILD
Quality over quantity. You do the right thing for yourself and your family and when you drop a video the views will be there. Congratulations on the great shop space.
Finish the Rudicon first. That one makes you money. Then pick which one you want to do.
Exelente....
Please, finish your projects and paint them very nice. Don´t make them look like a moving junkjard. An automotive designer product should look good.
Rudy. Will always support you. You were one of the stars of morr and still a star. Good luck to you and God bless. Do what you have to do first. The anticipation of your channel continuation will keep all of us on your toes. Peace,KC
You knoe starting YouTube  in this day and age when the algorithm  is all fucked, you have it spooned to you from ur dads channel, so u dont even need to post and ur getting a nice fat check every month must be nice l0l
Be careful guys I'm pretty sure someone is trying to scam people with a give away from Rudy.  Told me I won a free power washer and needed to pay for shipping.  Venmo account was from Virginia...be careful.
I’d like to see the rudicon fully done.
Finish the Rubicon first.
Way to go Rudy! So exciting to see your new work adventure start!
I am always surprised that MORR doesn't share video resources with the RAD and the other video teams in the area. They could have a pretty effective production company.
See ya soon no worries we love ya
Good luck.
Quality over quantity. :-)
Rudy, I have always thought this and I just want you to listen. My very good friends father started his welding business as a starving Baptist preachers son in his garage more than 50 years ago. By the time he sold out his welding business During the Obama administration he had over 150 employees earning a quality lifestyle and over a half million square feet of factory under roof. You have the knowledge to not only fabricate quality work, but also more importantly, estimate and bid quality work. You could do that as a way to pay the bills while figuring out what is your true passion in life.
Rudy's Adventures are worth the wait
My vote.. rudycon full done 😎
If you need a video editor.  I maybe to connect you with one.  He does freelance work.  Im sure he could help you.
Big stuff in the works! Congrats on the new shop!
Good things take time keep going Rudy 👍
Excited to see the next steps Rudy!  Keep pushing forward
Sweet new shop!
Congrats on the new shop Rudy! Can't wait to see it in action.
Just like a new Star Trek series. Second shop on the right and straight on til morning.
I want a sandwich...
Good for you!
Look forward to what you do with the Suburban.  I've got an 04 Suburban and 06 Silverado (Z71s) and there's a dedicated community out there keeping these vehicles on the road.  I think we'll still be running these vehicles 20 years from now.  Anyway, I was thinking with your skills you could do an awesome 4x4 Suburban overland conversion for camping in the mountains.
SOO much work. More than people realize. Keep it up and congrats on the new space
One thing worse than joe biden is a CLICK BAITER. NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOUR SORRY ASS CHANNEL THE ONLY REASON YOU HAVE A MAJORITY OF THOSE SUBSCRIBERS IS FROM MATTS OFF ROAD.
Hurry up I always watch you first before I turn on the cartoons. Good luck my friend....
Every step you take is just apart of the journey. Just keep moving.
Get the Comanche done firts as a daily driver, then get honest with your brother and work on his truck. The Rudycon is last. It's a fun project
No need to apologize we totally get that you are busy so just take your time and post when you can
So, um a video telling us there are more videos coming. Huh
👍👍
Happy for you on the new shop space don’t worry about the posts I enjoy them whenever you can post good luck to you
Extremely interested if your looking for a camera man and someone to edit ect I will relocate to Utah if your seriously looking for someone
To be honest, we have wondered where you've been. So glad to see this video and the fact that you're growing not leaving! PS you better get rid of that big giant swing in the new shop or you will get nothing done 🤣
Really enjoy your work. It would be nice to see more detail at times showing more of the CAD and skills that you are using.  I vote for working on your brothers old blue truck.
I was wondering how long it would take you to get a shop.
So what we're supposed to go hungry.  LoL keep putting out those sandwiches
Congratulations on the new location! In due time the content recording will fall into place. Don't stress yourself for us viewers/media. I'd rather watch one a month vs 3 a week until editors fall into the process for that volume content.
Don't worry we still like watching your videos carry on as you are
200,000 views in 24 hours … you got this Rudy! Fly buddy, FLY! ❤🎉
i want to see the comanchee the most
45 minute PBJs are inefficient no doubt.
Not the Scotty Kilmer title and thumbnail
For some reason now I want a sandwich...... Is the rest of the space MORR?
roo D roo D  roo D go  man go    finish off the rudicon  so it isnt 1/2 dun  any more
Welcome back!   Nice space.   Sounds like you're getting your life back in balance, good for you.   I really like the old Chevy pickup.   Buddy in high school had one, we wrenched on it all the time.
No worries buddy! Life is busy.   I'd like to see the rudicon get done then the c-10.
relax, slow down, enjoy life! you don't owe us anything!
At the end of the day Rudy, you gotta get the day job done for those dollary doos, and as much as I'd like to see the Commanche and C10 worked on, it'd be super nice to see the one and only Rudicon finished and Painted something other than that champagne colour. So the Rudicon gets my vote out of the 3. Plus you need a MOOR magnetic sign for the doors of the Rudicon when you're out on a mission.
Keep them coming Rudy and sure glad to you are doing good.
Hey thanks for the update. Was wondering why I haven't seen any videos from ya. Take your time my friend. Don't burn yourself out
This was a smart move ! Congrats  ! Just keep doing video's .. the more you make the easier it will be once you get going..
Good luck on your new adventures! Looking forward to what comes next........
Congrats on the new shop!  It looks awesome!!!!  It's always nice when you drop a new vid but don't expect it every week.   Kinda like a nice surprise when you do 😊
Finish the Rudicon. It has been a long time coming.
Have you thought about Freelancers for your editing? That is what I do on my Technology channel for servers, to network to applications.
You’re a motivation brother.
Keep going!
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾💯
Looking forward for that C10 build dude!
Do what you gottta do We'll be here waiting.  We'll get our Rudy/Janell fix from Mischief Maker.
Watch out for scammers in the comments. People are already using Rudy's logo. Keep up the good work Rudy!
Rudy,happy to see your still with us. Will talk with you really soon.
Comanche!!!!
Love the new shop! Can't wait to see what you do with your space. And as far as my favorite project, the C-10 hands down. While I do like the jeep stuff, I am a classic car guy at heart.
Great news Rudy, looking forward to seeing your new content.
Glad to see you again.
Just follow your heart man.
Do the Comanche first!! That’ll get you the most views
Keep grinding!!
Hello from Norway, thanks for the clarification, and to sum it all up, Awesome, and looking forward to the next page of this adventure
We enjoyed watching your videos and loved seeing you and your channel grow and evolve.  We are thrilled you will continue and will stay with you as you figure things out.
Nice shop
Unless I missed it, you didn't say if you quit your day job. If not, burn out will happen again. I read somewhere that sound quality is way more important than video quality so asap get microphones. Looking forward to watching the great content you create!
It takes time to find yourself and build a life. There will be breaks, life is not a smooth trip. Congrats and best wishes!
I'd look into a suspended ceiling and some carpet tile in the office/product review space.  It'll knock down the echo and improve your audio a ton.  I know carpet is not the best idea in a garage, but if you use the tiles, you can peel them up and replace them when they get grungy.  Congrats on the new space!
I totally understand.  I try to make content and when doing projects alone adding a camera In the mix makes things a lot hard and takes a lot more time.  I am trying to learn to juggle it.  Keep up the great work.
Bro my full time job averages 116 hours per WEEK!.   You can do it if you want.  Just depends on how much you want it.
Most excited to see the Comanche. Sad to see a C10 get lowered, but to each their own.
You go live your life Rudy and take us along when you can!!
Good to see you back. 🙂
I do like sandwiches
“If we fail to adapt, we fail to move forward.” John Wooden
Comanche!!!
Excellent,  love it!
Hear is wishing you the best and look forward to see where you grow!!!!
I hope so.
Your bro c10 first dude! Please!
Woohoo! Congrats on the new space Rudy! I appreciate the analogy. It does take more time to share the sandwich with others. I wish you well in finding the right balance. Thank you for sharing it with us.
Take your time, we’re patient!
New phone. Who dis?
Do what’s best for YOU
Ich mag wie hier die Autos gebaut werden. Entspannt und ordentlich.  Ich mag den jeep. Beim C10 bin ich raus aber bin trotzdem gespannt was daraus wird. Mach das in deinem Rhythmus und alles wird gut.
Hey don't sweat it,   there's many youtubers who only share 1 video a week or bi-weekly,  sometimes once a month.  When you have a life outside of youtube people need to understand and respect that.
I like seeing you work with your brother.  Let’s see the C-10. Any time schedule, don’t stress about it.
I love Rudy’s personality and humility. Much like his dad he gets along with everyone. Loved seeing Rudy collaborate with Holly at Mischiefmaker. I am looking forward to each of your projects. I am from Tacoma Washington but are in Sweden for awhile.
Get rudicon done, can wait to see it finished, keep up the good work
Sorry to hear you burnt yourself out man. We enjoy watching you make sandwiches but if you only have time to film 1 a month we will still be here. Good job for listening to your body and not pushing on think it would be fine.
I wish I could come and help you. Mr Ancient Prehistoric-YouTuber
Miss you bro, but figured as much your a busy dude! Congratulations on the new shop! My opinion would be finish the Rudicon then hit the c10 then the Comanche that’s just me
Burnout is REAL, in many things.. Enjoy yourself first and foremost.   Just remember, Mechanics... Start what they finish!
I'm sure we all understand being overwhelmed.  Your good brother. Id love to see the rudicon  finished.
Rudi, you do you, we are just along for the ride, don't feel like you have to say sorry , love the channel.
3:51 So much room for activities! 😁
Don’t be sorry, and thanks for the update. We patiently await your future content. 🎉
Stuff takes time! Real people have lives outside of projects and we all understand that. It’s cool to watch the guys that upload daily but I enjoy watching periodic updates just as much!
My vote is to finish the Rudicon!
You don't need to finish it the journey . Finding the parts the stuck nuts storyteller . Take your time with her she'll come out better to everyone's satisfaction.
I will be watching when ever you post a video.  You are a very intelligent young man.  God bless you. ❤️🙏🙏👍👍❤️
Thanks for taking the time to display your "sandwich" !!!!
C-10! what else, somthing different than all the other stuff!
Green with envy on the new shop. Congratulations!! Looking forward to your future content.
Down vote for click bait
Collins truck would be nice, hope everything is going to plan, it's been a while but still looking for those notifications, great work, all the best to yous and your loved ones
U should go back to your dad
Just started filming/editing and realize why being a YouTuber is kind of a second full time job. Part of me just wants to build my MJ fast,but I also want to share my joy with people. That being said, RAD jeep Comanche videos are worth the way brother.
C10 by far is the best build .
Don’t stop keep going the content is well worth the wait. Rock on Rudy !
Really great seeing you again Rudy! No need to apologize, one has to keep their priorities in order. Really happy to hear your going to be uploading again,and so looking forward to watching your projects and adventures. Love your channel and just glad your back.
I vote for the comanche to be finished first
You are so good at what you do. So just keep the video coming and good luck with the new shop.
don't tell us you are minus another girlfriend too haha 🙃
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD   LOTS OF HARD WORK  AND MORE WORK  HOPEFULLY YOU CAN DO IT FOR 50  PLUS YEARS  THEN DIE  AND GO TO MEET YOUR MAKER   THAT IS WHERE THE B/S IS OVER  / SO KEEP THE FAITH  AND I HOPE WE ALL GET TO SEE EACH OTHER  IN ETERNITY  /  YOU WILL MAKE IT  , YOUR A CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK , YOUR OLD MAN DID IT YOU WILL  DO IT  JUST KEEP ROWING THE BOAT AND DON'T STOP  / PS  GETTING OLD SUCKS  EYE SIGHT STARTS TO GO  / THANK GOD FOR BIG TYPE
As many have already stated, we are here for the quality of your content.  Many of us will gladly wait patiently for each episode.  Once again you prove why your success is growing and we keep watching.  Congrats on 200k+ and look forward to everything you share with us.  All the best to you and your family.
I was wondering what happened to you. Glad you are back. Can't wait for more content I enjoy it.
sometime in life less is more Rudy..we enjoy what you produce so far so let things roll and sort themselves out mate
I'm not going anywhere Rudy 😎
Hang in there.....stuff happens
Your dad needs a shop like that
Get that Comanche full crawler
I thought you were quitting the youtube thing, and I got big sad. Glad that was a joke. I think because you've come so far with the Rudicon, you should tackle that first.
Plug the fridge back in
glad it aint your last video, I enjoy seeing what you are up to - I'd like to see you and Colin finish the C10
You don't need to apologise.  I only have about 5 mins a week spare, it's easy to take too much stuff on.  Just film/post stuff when you feel like it, it should feel like fun not a commitment.
Time to step out in faith. I was sad to see you gone so long. Glad you are back!!
Its great to see you grow, I hope you can get some help with the behind the senes stuff to get your work out here on your channel. love your work!!!!!
fully understand the "Busy bug" so many people do not understand as you put so eloquently "so much behind the scenes" you dont see or may not understand but you working a full time job and trying to film your projects is another 40+ hour job especially by yourself. so hats off to you rudy for managing it the way you have for the time you have done, not an easy task!. love the Comanche and the rudicon would love to see both finished but cannot lie collins c-10 is a sweet project too. if i understood what program you used i would love to help (albeit im in Michigan lol) still would love to help. used to do a lot of radio/tv work when i was younger. dont know if that would help (minus being more local..would love that) but i offer none the less
Good deal 👍🙂- take care
RooooooDeee! Great seeing you. Congrats on the new building and all your projects.
Great shop, Rudy. Love it.❤ like to see you finish the Rudy con then the c10
Keep at it - congrats on the new shop 🎉
Rock on Brother!
Can't wait to see what happens in your future good luck R.A.D
Hi Ruby, my husband and I have been watching since you went out on your own, don't panic about how many or when you put videos out, we are here ready to support you whenever. You are doing are great job. Thumbs up from Australia 🤠🇦🇺👍
🤙🏽
Work it!👍
Keep doing what you do, I enjoy the content.
Rudy, don't stress, it takes time and so many people love seeing what you are working on, creating and watching all your hard work come to fruition. Thanks for all content!
Great to hear! Get that C10 done for your brother!
That's a great space, can't wait to see what you come up with.
Wondered where you got to all the best for you and the new unit
Thanks for taking the time to do the videos, like others have said don’t worry about the frequency.
Accomplish your dreams kid I think your going to succeed just keep at it why you can!!!
Go well Rudy - you have a life to lead and we are all fans that can wait for the good stuff you give us. We will all be there waiting so get settled and keep it up - love what ever you post.
I'm not looking for an apology. Thank you for producing content when life permits.
Congratulations, happy to hear you are going to continue making videos. Enjoy each and every one of them. Keep up the good work.
The Rudicon's 1/2 dun, that's plenty for now. I vote Kaulin's truck first, Comanche second, Rudicon for the season finale!
I totally feel you on working a full time job and trying to release content! I have been trying to complete a video for five months and it has been one thing after another!
No reason to apologize.  It shows that Matt and Jamie raised you well. Congratulations on the new place
What's the best bed?  Serta?  Flatbed?  Nope. The best bed is subscri-bed.
I think the most successful YouTubers have the main character serving as director/producer, and a partner doing filming and editing.  These are essentially four full-time jobs.  It's possible to do two and still have a day job.  Very difficult to do all four and still work a 40 hr a week job.  For example, your dad has a crew of cameramen, and an editor, so he can concentrate on content.  And his day job supplies all that content.  I think your real forte is design, cutting, and welding beautiful parts for other people.  I really enjoy watching that kind of content, being an engineering geek.  That's the stuff I really look for in Matt's, Paul's, and Hollie's videos.  Scary cliff recoveries, not so much.  You could say I like seeing the building a lot more than rock crawling until something breaks.  I also watch farm videos for the building, rather than feeding the animals.
Rudicon first! 🙌🏻
Don’t worry about any of this, your business is your business. Many subscribers seem to get impatient. I’m not one of them. You do you! Enjoy a nice Thanksgiving with the family. I might even make it down to the La Verkin house next week.
Get the Rudicon done, I'm excited to see that one
Love the new space! I'd say my list of your builds I want to see are (1) Rudicon finished, (2) C10 frame swap, and (3) the other one.
Good to hear  Rudy, looking forward to seeing what your up to
Keep it up.  I'd rather you post slowly and not be burned out than to lose your channel!
Can’t wait
thank you Rudy,  i was getting worried about you.
You joined  the pligs
how about a video / discussion about this new OHV  class about to go into affect 1/1/23
U got us a fans an followers we have been missing ya but we’re here when ever u post. I’ll be follower to the very end. Enjoy ur builds an I’m currently building a xj so I very much enjoy seeing the rudicon out
just keep in mind my views count  is at 141,000 in 11 hrs and rudy you have 203,000 subs all you got to do is do it and no apologies needed my man
Hopeyou and your dad still talk to one another maybe your mom could help you get your videos done easier ok
Nice new sandwich shop!  Order up!
Rudy are you still working fir your dad or not ok I was hoping you and your dad would work together on the big wrecker but haven't seen you on any of them ok
Way to go Rudy! No apoligies needed. Making content and video is time consuming, Hang in there looking forward to it!
Right on Rudy, cant wait to see what you produce in the upcoming videos.  Have you thought about doing a merch drop to help fund the adventures ahead? It would be quite RAD if you did.  Good luck and congratulations on the new shop.
Get the Comanche goin
Best of luck on the new direction. You'll do great.
The Comanche, the Rudicon and then the C10. In that order.
Stoked
Yay! Go get em tiger!
Do what you have to I enjoy your videos. Take care
Get to it rudy looking forward to your projects
Yeah! Glad you're still at it Rudy. Missed seeing your vids. Haven't seen you on your dad's channel though either. Although, Lizzy is getting some good trigger time on the mig, and putting out some pretty nice welds!🤭 Looking forward to seeing more of your content.👍😎🇺🇸
Amen Rudy, no worries man! Life is what happens when your tryin to have a good time. Do what you need to do, we’re all Sub’d; and we’ll be here when the momentum starts rollin again! 🤘
Make whatever videos you want when you can. Don't burn yourself out.  Project wise, you have the rudicon to a usable state.  I would try to get the Comanche to at least that point in the build before tearing into the Rudicon so that you have a usable rig to enjoy while it's down. I'd work in the C10 either before, during or after wherever parts availability allows it to fit best.
On finishing one of the three.. pick the one that is the easiest, COST wise and time wise.. and knock it out. VS the most amazing costly that takes forever and burns you out. Get one done while getting comfy on the build/film/work schedule. Most important.. keep it fun.. find your balance.
No worries bro. Take the time to rest and relax when you need and just do you we'll be here regardless because we enjoy watching what you do
These videos are awesome…we understand how life sometimes complicates things.  One video a month is possible l would hope.
You got to do whats best for you. But in the end your fans will still be here when you get back. Thanks for sharing. Really enjoy the videos. Been very helpful. 🐸
very happy to see you back.
Do the bagged c10 first!..... Too many other Youtube channels building off-road stuff!
Thanks for the update Rudy, I know your dad is even busier but it would be great to see him helping you for once, in one of his videos.
Make a view more appearances on MORR also
Just work at your own pace. We'll still be here.
Colorado city , long commute from la Varkin
As a comanche owner I'm geeked about that build.
Like the Comanche the most, oddly. But whatever ya do I’ll be interested.
Been missing you and your quirky mind!! Glad you are doing well and coming back. As to projects, as much as I like the RudiCon, I wish you would get back to the Comanche or the C10... But that's simply my personal tastes!!!
what was your Dads last video editor man  crap 4gotten his name lol  but keep up the great work Rudy  this is your journey
Can’t wait to see more builds ✌🏻
I like the old pick up truck
So you’re a short cricker now?
Get the C10 done that’d be awesome.
Keep it up Rudy! You’re a good dude!
If you didn't know Rudy , that jib Crain mounted to that support column is not OSHA approved.   LOL. Congrats on the new shop. Hope it's not to much of a drive from home . That always sucks.
Sweet!!!!!
Glad for you. Been missing your page
The rumors are starting to circulate!  The IRS is hiring a huge quantity of new auditors, and planning to target people making money on internet channels!  Make sure you have been claiming all your income, and contributions !!!  Spreading the word before it's too late!
Keep the videos coming.   Even if not very often.    Watch you from Canada
Awesome I'm excited!!
I've got a Sony a7ii and id be willing to film for you.
No need to apologize.  Success in your new challenge.  Blessings.
My daughter is saying she wants to start a business in editing content for YouTube.  Is that marketable as a profession in general?  I have no idea.  Anyone have any info on content editing?
Good luck Rudy. Looking forward!
I have a lot of videos that I took on my farm but I don't know what video editing software to use... So if anyone can point me to what works well and is easy to use... Thanks in advance!
No need to apologize
Nothing but best wishes on your new digging and adventure.🍀🍀🍀
Comanche
Dude.... you are golden .... no worries.... (Rudicon for the win... it's the first and cries the loudest for me) .... keep on keepin on Rudy ...
Been waiting
Awesome good to see you guys again just remember have fun with it don’t make it a job
All three are going to be great! Start with which ever is closest to being finished and work down? Thats what I would do.
So it seams like the guy you work for is moving with you to the new shop. If so that means a lot. Pretty cool.  I would start training your replacement though
Just keep taking life one day at a time, one foot in front of the other. You’ll get where you are going. Congratulations on the new shop!
Congrats on the new shop. As much as we enjoy your content I understand you have to take care of business.
Congratulations on the new spot!
You should work on Collins truck first.
How’s about some derby cars?
Wondering where you disappeared too, now we know. Don't worry, we have all suffered from overload. The only road out of overload, I have found, is to focus on one project. Don't try to do too many things at once and stick to that focused project. When that project is completed you will feel the success and continue to the next one. And yes, you can not be successful on a project, have to restart it, or drop it all together but remember you learn from your mistakes. Take that from one who has had hundreds of mistakes in my 50 plus year career. Look forward to your next video. Good luck
Best Of Luck with your new adventure!
Cool thing Rudy!!! Make sure your Dad won't move in 🙂. No apologies necessary, you have a live too!!
All three are awesome builds, but I think the C10 is my favorite.
Buy a Rokon.
I enjoy whatever content you put out.
I don't know I like the Comanche, but I've been watching since the beginning of the Rudikon. I would like to see it get past 1/2 done. Maybe 3/4?
I always wondered why you didn't video more. Thanks for sharing,an please understand that no matter what we are always here for you. Good content is better than a lot of content. Do what you do, an share when you can. Thanks bro....
your priorities matter more than our entertainment.
Like your content but take care of you first. And that sweet girl.
Creating content is tough, sometimes you just want to power through the work and skip the filming
No Apology necessary Brother ! We Completely understand. We missed you ❤️
I figured you were just busy! Glad I was right😅
Quality not quantity,  you do cool stuff so no worries 👍
Restore an xj keep it fsctory and wheel it !!
No apologies needed! Its about the Journey, not the Destination. I/we enjoy your progress and appreciate it when you can take us along. Burn-out is Real! Keep up the good life!
Can someone fill me in as to why Rudy is no longer working with his dad and appearing on his channel?
Do what you want just pace yourself.  You are to young to be burning yourself out. Family always comes first so there is my 2 cents for your next project. Just don't burn yourself out worrying about the little things because you will stop enjoying what you do.
Is that a shiner on your eye?
Keep up the hustle I know it's going to work out for you 🤙🏼
some times things take time to fit in place. great to hear about new building.
That looks like the Skyline stove shop in Hildale UT where I grew up. That is awesome. Glad it is being put to good use.
Clickbait titles? Are u that desperate? Just keep doing what you want to do which is why i subscribe. But...if you are just doing vids for view count...bye.
No apologies needed. I've enjoyed watching and hope for the best for you.
Dude get to working on the c10. I can’t wait to see that swap
Love you Rudy... post video when you can. Don't be sorry! Will be here to watch
Are you and Hunter Goodrich twins?
C10
Glad you’re back bro!
🤙
Giterdun Rudy !!!.... thanks for sharing this with us
I was going to suggest posting videos about building safes, but a shop build an finishing up your project sounds good 👍
Rudicon finish the Rudicon
You should make a video of you making a sandwich.  I like sandwiches.  :)
Love the c10. As I have a 66c20 all the 4wd info is always good to know and see aswell.
What do I want to see? I want to see YOU do what YOU do best. Be a success, meet a girl, make more people, and be well. Good luck!
Don't tell us what you're going to do, show us what you have done.  Over a month to make a  sh it  sandwich leaves a bad taste.
Nice job. Can’t sit to watch the builds come through
We miss u with your dad also
Collen’s C-10 is beginning to sound like an old Johnny Cash song? We enjoy the content and we will take it when we can get it. When your late it’s just life, take your time and experience the ride.
No worries. Congrats on your new work space!!!! You have to start somewhere. Don't care what you build. Work on your brothers truck. Rudicon is a work in progress. So, as you work on that, film it. But, the Comanche can wait. Work on your brother's truck first. Family first. You will be happy, and your brother will be HAPPIER!!! PLUS, that is a huge undertaking, so plenty of content there. I'm guessing a year or the better part of a year for that project. One other thing. Don't EVER feel like you have to have content out every week. Post as you can. No stress, just relax. I'd be happy with just 3 vids a month. YT, CAN get crazy. DO NOT LET THAT HAPPEN TO YOU. Your projects ARE more important anyhow. Congrats!!!! Keep focused, and you will do just fine. I'd love to help you, but as I'm more or less stuck at home with kidney failure, that isn't an option for me right now. I wish you all the grace of God for your future endeavors!!!!!!!!!
Utah is a Haven for Automotive Fabrication!
Do what you can,  when you can. Staying loyal.
we love you bro
It is what it is Rudy. I'll still be watching when you can get it out. Best of luck.
I'm glad you are expanding your operation.  More content can make it even better. It's great to have a boss that understands yours dreams and goals.
Don’t be e to hard on yourself countless YouTubers that have a bunch of unfinished projects Rudy your doing great your videos get views that other NEWER channels wish they got Keep experimenting with what works for you There’s no doubt your channel is going to Very successful you have everything it takes
Don’t worry about it man I know it takes forever to shoot and edit I’ll watch them when you get them out
Deffently the rudicon thats my favorite  !!
Hang in there kiddo.  It takes time just ask dad lol. The man upstairs will make things happen for you. Acknowledge some of your comments and have fun
Keep on keepin' on Rudy!  Can't wait to see what you have in store for us and the best of luck to you!
The rudicon has been half dun for damn near a year now.
Congratulations on your new shop we enjoy your personality and the content that you have provided those of us that are here we’ve waited for this video and we will be here for your next so thank you young man Take your time and I hope everything works out for you may you be blessed every day of your life and all your dreams come true and I will be more than happy to watch your content as it all happens thank you once again
Looking forward to the Comanche build!
Don’t worry we got you bro. 👍🏾👍🏾 and congrats on the new shop.
Rudy, I like the way you carry yourself and that you obviously care a lot about the people around you. Do what makes you happy. We'll wait for videos.
No worries Rudy, Happy to watch your content, whenever it is available.  For us, we have reverted to just instagram for our fabrication projects for now, but need to get back on producing content for YT.  Keep plugging away brother!  ( If you like mini bike projects, give us a watch! ) @daddaughterfab
Growing pains can be tough we understand.  Burn out is never good!  Our pic is finish your RudiCon. Here is to your new shop very 👍👍
I had to pause this video so I could go make a sandwich.  🥪🥪
Keep making it.
Comanche!
Don't sweat it, I think most of us know you have a full time job and you tube isn't it.
Congratulations! You are very stoked about your new shop and it shows. Thank you for sharing! Look forward to seeing you continue to grow and develop your channel.
I totally get it. Trying to work and take on all of the rest to make a video is super frustrating at times, especially when you just want to get things done. Grats on the new shop. Keep up the good(hard) work Rudy!
It take time to build greatness good luck with it
The new space looks sweet.
I thought you went out and got married!!!!!! She seams like a keeper....
Love you Rudy!!!! Glad to see you back.  You are rocking it!!
Get the Rudicon finished.  I love it when Matt needs your help.
Click bate
Great!! Keep it up Rudy!!
Great to follow you and watch you grow. I am along for the adventure Let's rock!
Never apologize for running the channel the way you have to. There's nothing worse than channels that make promises and apology videos constantly making themselves feel like they should be more. Please, just focus on doing the things that matter and work for you. The only benefit of  a strict schedule is that the algorithm likes them, so if anyone do it for yourself, but don't waste a second feeling bad for us.
Finish the rudicon
Do videos when ya feel like doing videos - we'll be glad to checkout whatever you upload.  I especially like the vehicle build/update vids.
Get your younger bros friends invokved....
Don't apologize bro, your more than a YouTube legend,your a man on a mission,I look forward to your videos but understand that life happens ✊
U n ur dad hate eachother
I would enjoy seeing the Rudicon elevate from 1/2 done to 3/4 done, for sure. But as an owner of a ‘64 & a ‘66 Chevy panel trucks (“Carry-Alls”)… and conveniently a 2003 Avalanche Z71 I’ll be retiring next summer, I’m partial to the frame swap as well.
I bake my own bread soooooo....No apology required!
Keep grinding on your journey! Love to see you bro’s truck done first.
Should be able to find an editing dude pretty easily
Don’t worry post when you can. You make wonderful content.
RAD Dude.....
You put it out, we will watch it. Keep up the good work!
Hang in there!!!!!!!  Take care of what ya got to do.  Post when you can!!!!  NP!!!!!!!!
One step at a time. Measurable goals. And I hope we will still see a particular young lady in the videos as well. If not, stay strong, one foot in front of the other.
It seems like every content creator here on YT grows in spurts. Our journeys are all slightly different but finding balance and more importantly HARMONY with YT and our lives is overwhelming at times. (Just ask your dad!) The longer that you are immersed in your YT journey you will find that harmony will creep up on you! Keep the content coming Rudy!
Now I want a sandwich
Rudy, good to hear from you.  In today’s world of “what’s in it for me”, work ethic and responsibility are rare qualities. It says a lot about you, that you respect the people you work for and care about those of us that have subscribed to RAD.  You make the videos and we will enjoy watching.  As far as projects go, just pick one and go for it.👍🇺🇸
Don’t worry about frequency if content mate, one YouTuber I watch is one video every 18 months or so 😅
I vote. 3/4 DUN Rudicon!!!
5 minutes to make a sandwich?!  I think I have P&J down to about 14.7 seconds!   Take your time!
Rudy, we're just glad when we DO get to see you, don't feel obligated, just do what you can when you can..
old chevy
Im so happy to see you learning through life and making decisions.  Keep it up and i will remain a faithful follower whenever you update us.
I am so jealous of that shop space!
Colin, Commanche, Rudicon. Editing and posting is difficult even for those with help or $$$$. Not good to burnout, prioritize and leave time for fun.
Thanks for the update. You know you have a following like Dale Earnhardt Junior Nation. We could call it "Rudy Nation" LOL. You CAN'T work of the RudiCon because it always has to be Half-Dun so that's off the table. I think Collen (sp?) needs his C-10. My nephew is in the process of building a C-10. I just miss hearing Trevor say "RUUUDDDYY?"  LOL
Just keep looking forward stay strong
You got this and no need for an apology.  Just use your father's example of hard work to inspire you.
Slamming 2wd trucks now. . Hmmmm. Wrong set of viewers bud. When’s the squatted truck build?
Hey pulled up beside you in Rudicon heading trail hero , I honked you waived back man that machine is loud 😂. I helped build machine shop and welding business over 20 yr period. My partner bought me out 2011 . All I can tell you get up early and stay late , like tell everyone don’t wait ship come in got swim out to it .
I’m proud of you
What a great space
I guess I cannot see a reason for leaving Matt.
I was worried about you, I’m glad to see you still doing your thing!! Can’t wait for all the upcoming content and looking forward to seeing you continue to grow, thrive and succeed!!!!
Loved seeing you daily at Matt’s off road. Still don’t know why you left there.
Keeping both eyes out for new content
Stay the course. You produce quality content, and that takes time.  My favorite build so far is the Comanche which has the potential for even more.
Scarcity becomes value. 😅🤣😂 You do things your own way in your own time.   Rudy’s a Pimp.
Oh no!!! I've been waiting for your videos.... Keep your head up high.
Work your behind off while you're young.  As an elder, I can tell you that old age creeps on you before you know it.  Use your youth wisely.  There was/is another Ew Toober that did off road stuff and was really popular but he enjoyed off road and ironically his work career more and the Ew Toob stuff was third on his list in life.  I really miss his content but it's his choice for his life.  Good luck!
Pretty easy to spend 100+ hours on a 20 min video especially when your fabricating and testing stuff. Glad you're still doing it and always happy to see a new video!! A bunch of my favorite YouTubers are once or twice a month or even less often. Don't worry too much about regular posting until you can get a team behind you. You've got great content and rushing it for the sake of a regular post won't do you or us any favors.
Yeah no worries on timing.  Of course I'd like to seek as many vids as possible because the work you do I find so interesting and plus it's a skill of which I have none at all.  Congrats on the new shop space, one of the best bits of advice I've heard about shop space is having enough empty room to get work done.  Project:  The Comanche!  As the Rudicon progresses, yup that's cool, but the comanche is a whole new animal altogether.
Hey Rudy ...best of luck and success on your new venture,,,you got skills, attitude and personality to make for a top notch Utoob channel.
Freaking awesome Rudy
Digging the channel. I like the Comanche build.
Good luck! scary area to have a shop. LOL
Sweet new digs. See ya on the next one.
Umm that sure looks like the adult casting couch set! 😂
Nice video Rudy! I was kind of wondering where you've been lately. NOW I know the scoop. I hope you get set up in the new spot and can get cranking on those projects. I'll be watching!!! 😃
Post when you can. We enjoy your videos. My personal favorite is the Jeep truck. Back in the late 60s I had a full size jeep truck. Like every Jeep I've owned (1946 CJ-2 to a mid 90s Cherokee), I loved it. But it just couldn't pass up a shop if it went by one.
No need to apologize. We will watch whatever you have time to film, Rudy. I can't wait to see the Rudicon get finished!! If I knew how to edit, I would volunteer to help you out. Sadly, I don't know how. :( Be safe, have fun, and we will be here whenever you can put something new out. :)
Congrats! Can't wait.
Burn out is rough. You are having a really tough time because you are trying to make content out of something you love to do. Make sure you don't spoil that for yourself.
1. Collin’s Truck 2. Comanche 3. Rudicon
finally you slacker.  it's crazy how your day job can interfere with life.
Wondering y y’all don’t work for ur dad  anymore
Finish the half dun Rudicon already.  And you have to keep up with the jones.. aka fabrats. All you guys rock and say hi to Ed for chance
I’m so proud of you Rudy 🎉
No apology needed Rudy. You have a personal life. We understand you can only do what you can in making videos it's a job in itself.  We are all interested in your videos your a great person and the things you do are awesome and we love to ride along and watch and learn. Thank you for the videos.
Your father still wins
Take your time Rudy we love you and all it means is that you are qrowing which is a good thing
Cool Rudy cant wait to see it and how the Comanche turned out  and also looking forward to the C10 pickup getting chopped bagged and dropped into the weeds with a nice newer chevy powerplant in it.
Keep it jp Rudy we will keep watching. Nice building looks good. Like you gotta start finishing projects so pick one and run with it.
Relax Rudy. We appreciate what you do. You have to have time for yourself too or you will wreck your life. No one is here to see you crash and burn. I hope to see a happy Rudy and family share their interesting life for a long time.
Ultimately you need to find your feet as the saying goes, I wouldn't be trying too hard to get too big too quick, as it ends up having negative consequences. Learn your craft, get better, just don't get impatient. If it's meant to be, it will be. Have enjoyed your content so far, so keep on truckin.
Miss you, dude! I'd like to see the Rudycon done, if you ask me. I think it is the most interesting content I'd like to watch, followed close by Collen's truck. Have fun and stay healthy!
Glad this wasn’t the last one.  Finish the Rudicon.  Where does Janelle fit in?    Looking forward to whatever you decide.
COOL
Rudicon needs to not be half done!
gee, a mechanic with tons of cool projects in the works and none of them finished... that's how I've spent the last 20 years.
congrats
Keep it going . Keep your head up.
Like it
For the algorithm
I would love to help out with putting Colin's c10 on bags.
Keep up the good work! Cheers from Brazil!
Was wondering where you've been.  Glad to see you back Rudy!  Congratulations on your new shop.  Fix it up the way YOU want it.  Thanks.
we  will  be  here     good  luck
Nice to see you back on the interweb 🤘
Why apologise? Thanks for sharing projects when you can. New space is awesome! Shower needs a curtain :p
Quality over quantity. Good content is worth the wait. I'll be sticking around.
Rudy I have tried to make do dirt bike riding videos, hours of going through shaky helmet camera footage to find a few cool seconds and then trying to tie together a bunch of cool moments into a cohesive story and maybe talk a bit is so hard to make even minutes of quality video. I feel ya for how hard good videos are to make.
we miss you on the track rudy.
Hey Rudy. I would say 2 things. 1 don’t be concerned about how much content you produce. I’m sure your dad did produce that much at the beginning, or Paul.  2. I personally appreciate a little more raw than polished when it comes to edited content. Make a pb&j, and don’t worry about making paninis with roasted peppers and aioli 🤪. Ive enjoyed watching what you have produced. I have an adventure coming soon to see our lone sequoia. Cool to know one exists here. Do what you do, have fun, and don’t burn yourself out.
Cool! Congrats
Humble, hardworking & honest 3 very good traits.  Your analogy was very good ~ something fairly easy becomes a little harder and a lot more time consuming  Timely project completion is very important for all parties. Please tell my local speed shop this for my road racing track car!  Always $$$$ business work 1st.  Video should/can trail some along with its frequency.  Take as much raw video footage that's not time sensitive using it as needed later on when you have some nonrevenue producing time available to edit/produce it.  Presently you need a/any cash cow that aids growth.  Success breads more successes. Many small success in the right direction are a huge step!  Take a look at Fab Rats to help you with a business model.  Yours needs to be different but their scale & methodology should be very helpful/informative.  Paul & his wife did this very effectively from your father's business! Your business growing should be your 1st goal then good video content following as time frees Up just enough.  Good luck, but more so work smart, develop good short term partnerships &/or trade agreements.  Rudy, you're going to do Well...
👍 👍 👍 👍
Take your time, Rudy.  You be you and I'm sure you'll pull through!  We'll be here when you do ;)
Burn-out is real. Fortunately you understand that it is necessary to put things in their proper perspective.  Hollie and Walter are proud of your work on Nessie. You made a beautiful design and finished it so fast.  The Rudicon may be only 1/2 Dun but, is a top notch performer at Sand Hollow!  Thanks for sharing.
Can't wait for the C10. I have a 66 K20 with a long list of upgrades to it. I have been the caretaker of it since 1988. It's worn out and broke just about every part, multiple times. Right now it's straight, rust free, and in primer, waiting for paint, sitting on 1 tons with a healthy big block and a 4L85E.
Just be you man, don't worry about everybody else, you'll be fine!! Keep up the good work! We all know you come from good stock!
What your brother said.  Good analogy.
Life’s hard sometimes. Do you what’s best for you. We have much respect for you and your family.
Wholly cow Rudy!, what a surprise! That is an awesome building to help you grow! As many others say take your time to video your content!👍 Just get settled in your new place & your loyal fans will keep up with you! 🤘😉🤙
Go for it Rudy. God bless you in all you do.
Good luck man like everyone else take care of yourself. We will enjoy the videos as they come.
Stick with a simple sandwich… a ‘wish sandwich two pieces of bread and wished you had something to put between them’.
Luv u guys F'n off withe hoist in New shop (thats is so awsum) Cant wait for more Rudy's adventures !   PEACE  ☮ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Whats up I'll bro .
"A lot of projects started, and not very many finished." Welcome to my world. It's the same problem that everyone who works for a living faces.  Where's Janelle?
Be yourself on your own schedule! Videos are worth the wait.
Congrats Rudy. Look forward to seeing the upcoming adventures. Build on Bud. Enjoy
Go for the rudycon young man! Rock on
Congratulations
It all starts with putting roots down before growing. I’m glad to see you growing
Hey Brother, good to know everything it’s ok! No apologies needed! Sometimes you just need to take a step back and reevaluate!  Congratulations on your new shop! Glad do hear and see you doing good! Would love to eventually see all of those projects documented on the channel, but if I had to pick one for now, I’d pick to continue the Comanche build. But regardless of wich one you chose, I’ll be watching either way, because I enjoy them all!  Looking forward to more videos to come!
I wanna see the Comanche get finished
Ready and waiting .
How dare you click bait us to make us watch a video… hahaha JK I love your stuff man! The jeep Comanche videos are my favorite so far. They’re what brought me to the channel.
Keep plugging along Rudy. Slow and steady. Love watching your stuff.
Wow!! What a great space!!
What is needed to make 1/2 Dunn into 3/4 Dunn?
We love your Jeep Comanche!
i like BLT
Go for it! Rudicon is waiting...!
I like the Comanche the most, but the fact that the Rudicon has had “1/2 dun” on it for like a year has really made me wanna see it get completed.
I feel like a sandwich.
my question  would be why move is he not paying rent at other place!  hmmmm
Colin’s 64? Chevy
You better post more content! or else, or else, Ill be sad. OK Don't  worry about me, BE HAPPY.
Pay your Dad’s editors to do that work.
NO WORRIES, ITS ALL GOOD, a full time  job, plus YT, its alot, nice to see you..nice new digs for your projects
Congratulations on the new shop and looking forward to new videos !
Quality over quantity. Keep them coming at pace that makes you happy and proud of your content. I will keep watching n
New space looks sweet
It’s not always easy to give up a steady paycheck for the uncertainty of being self employed, whether it’s from YT revenue or more traditional work…
Get the 1/2 dun fully dun. Lol
Hey dude I appreciate all you've done and just be you and do not worry about it.
Good luck
Shame on you for not posted for so long! 😉 We all love ya, and can't wait to see what you got going on in the works! But, I think the C10 is what we all want to see done first! Congrats on the new working area!!!! ❤️
Keep chasing your dreams. (Hope you still have the girlfriend)!
Good luck Rudy
No worries, Rudy.  You have a lot of people out here rooting for ya!!  Be patient.  As time goes on, you'll become more efficient.  Keep at it, man.
when  you  put out an episode  i will watch it. If there is no episode ill not watch it.
big intro's and extra like video clips added in are not for me i like a plain and simple video
Man I get it!  Ill have hours of video, take 5 hours to edit down to a 15 minute video.  Its a full time job if you try to make a YT career!  Congrats on the shop!
You gotta do what you gotta do. But when you do post, I hope it’s the Comanche!
Do what you need to do, sir. We aren't going anywhere. As a YouTuber myself, I can related. Back when I still drove trucks, I used to do truck driving videos. About three years into my career, I stopped because the editing work was taking way too much time with my slow laptop, and it got to the point where I lost interest in doing it.
Awesome news. Can’t wait.
Don't worry. Less sandwiches make you more hungry. So when ever you make them they will be more appreciated.
Awe, thanks for update..I've been looking for you..very happy to hear you'll continue making videos..was awesome seeing yr new shop..soon cool..was great seeing you and your brother..I'm sorry I don't know how to spell his name ;)
The C10 build would be cool.
*Starting out in anything is hard. I bet if you asked for " Volunteers " many capable people will step forward to help you maintain what we all know you're capable of. Stay Safe and True to Yourself and with God's Continued Blessing, your Light will shine.*
Commanche!!!!
Apple Valley?
You got to finish the Rudicon.  It's the OG in da houzzz.
HOLY SNAPPIN DUCKS BATMAN! That building is HUGE!
One big tip - people don't watch "content" they watch videos, otherwise known as stories!
Room in the shop for an indoor go-cart track, plan carefully an try to find a way long term to buy the building. down the road even this building is small .  A lift is a good start . We are glad your out there an will eventually  surpass the older geasers on you tube .It appears some are trying to create content an it works to a certain extent ,just remember we are not dumb ,we understand content ,you are in open book write as you go.
I would be happy to help you edit your content for only credits. I'm far away, but a lot of that can be done remotely.
Hey don't worry
so, did i miss something? are you renting that building or bought it? i know it is a big step but i hope you bought it. you could have living quarters in one end and shop/ office in rest. again, maybe i missed something. i was just wondering what happened to ya. lol
Thanks for the update.  I kept waiting for a new video from you, figured you were just busy.  Personally, I can't wait to see "1/2 Dun" become "Dun."  Then Kaulin's rig, then the Comanche.  I always liked the idea of an old body on a modern chassis.
I'm sure it takes money too, to do what ya like. So congratulations on the new shop
C10 frame swap is gonna b a cool project to see.. looking forward to seeing the Rudicon finished also..😉
Good job Rudy work hard play hard. You need to do it when your young.
So...what you're saying is you're human and normal?! Take it easy and I look forward to your next build adventure!
I know exactly what you're saying... I have a one person YouTube operation myself and it is very tiring since I also work a 12hr a day full time job!!! It is very hard to keep up and I'm 30 videos behind!!
Glad to hear you're doing well. Love your videos, don't worry about the frequency, it's all good. Take care!!
Finish the Rudicon (make it an awesome recovery rig in its own right),  do the Comanche, and help your dad out with recoveries. That’s the formula. The C10 is OK, but it’s not the bread and butter that draws us to your show (and the type of shoe that drew us to Matt’s and FabRats).  2 WD trucks are done better elsewhere…
All is good Rudy! You have a smart head on those shoulders. You know what comes first and that is what pays the bills. not just money but the  debt you owe to others for helping you get to where you are. Much respect!! You keep doing what you have to do and we are along for the ride. And your Fab skills are amazing! Nothing to apologize for and all.
You're forgiven 😁. We enjoying watching when you do.
I hate clickbait titles.
First & foremost congratulations 🎊 this is awesome to see ya'll growing
Thank you for the apology though I think that we all agree that it wasn't needed. It takes time to get your feet under you. Truly good to see that life is moving forward for you. We all wish you the best of luck and look forward to seeing what the future holds for you.
We’re patiently waiting for you to get rolling again on your videos. Love your content and would love to see the Cherokee build, because that’s what I’m fixing to do for my next project.
Good Luck !
Go for it Hoss, I'll be watchin' from SW  Alberta
Congrats on the shop. Killer space.  Good work.
I get it.  I’ve got two jobs a van conversion project, and a you tube channel.  It’s a lot.  Editing is a pain in the ass.
Brother YOU have to do, what you have to do, we'll watch when you post them
203k subcribers is a lot, 77 % of utubers don't get close to there, that's huge, keep it going
Your human Rudy so just take your time and you will get them done
Rudy - get yourself an editor record vids and just throw the vids at them a competant editor will sort it out and will also pay for themselves   don't be sorry just keep up the good work  I know the project situation heres my projects  Electric van - AXIAM MEGA   Honda deauville restore and sell  yamaha xt660 - engine swap  my sons quad bike new engine and frame mods
Is this videos title click bait???
Colorado city? We will have to collab if I ever get Kanab figured out. Nice shop.
I love watching you guys since like 100k subscribers from Matt's offroad and since the 20k or so mark for you buddy. Congrats, don't let anything detour you off course!✌
Good luck
Sadly sad
Dude, just chill if you feel burned out, take a break, it's fine. Your fans aren't going anywhere.
Colins truck please!! Love the older truck stuff with a clean resto/build
Keep making videos when you have time. Your expectations are your own. Don't compare yourself to someone else or their expectations.
Rudy, don't apologize for life. It happens, your human and you need rest and time to yourself. As far as the new shop; that's amazing and congratulations. Just be sure to pace yourself and make time for yourself!
Can,t wait! I like watching you work.
Rudicon.
Rudicon!
👍👍
i wish you the best of luck guys keep up the good work
You are just like your father ! Good bye 👋!
Finish the Rudicon as it’s pretty close.
Wow. We’re all excited for you. You have great ambitions. Keep it up. Look at all the projects all your fellow your YouTube friends have incomplete. We will watch you grow patiently.
I was thinking you needed a space of your own. We’ll be here when you post and are rooting for you every day.
Just glad your OK.  Take your time and just be yourself it's what makes it 👌👍
Nothing great is built in a day. Go forth and build your greatness!
Rudy you have over 200k subscribers in very short time most of them from your dad subscribers  .know its up to you how to use this blessing .
Build Colin’s chevy
Get that XJ done next and remove that 1/2 Dunn tape job once and for all, sheesh 😆
thank u !!!  best of wishs on all thats new and up-coming Rudy !!!!! oitt's NOT easy in the world of a utuber.  it's all about what u want, how much do u want !!  b it wrk,relatioships,Utube or whatever.   It's YOUR world U decide !!!! juust ALWAYS b honest with U 1st & everyone else rightafter. meanwhile i'll b watching fron my chair and enjoying what comes from U !!!! ATB 8)
Work on old Chevy pickup. 👍👍👍👍👍
We are with you, so don't be sorry and give things time for everything to work out. This is gonna be fun, you'll see.
I was really sad, you had just gotten the Comanche and it was all looking up, and then …. SILENCE… I understand though, glad to see you’ve got your own place! Going to be great!!! Keep it up Rudy!
Totally get it Rudy.   I filmed with 3 gopros, a sony 4K video camera, dslr, and a phone last year for a 3 month trip around the country....I got a total of 4 videos I think and I ran out of gas....massive amount of time to pull the right clips from everything you take, and then put it to music, etc, etc.  I applaud you for doing what you can with what you have, and I think your family is awesome in how they support you when they can.    Keep working at it, and you'll get it all together.👍
Take your time love the content !!!
Wow! With all that shop space and a prescription of adderall you could really get some projects wrapped up! Congrats on all the exciting news, we will be here patiently awaiting your posts, but no pressure!
Finish rudicon
Good to hear the good news, I really enjoy watching your videos. Keep up your exciting and awesome content. Thanks Rudy.
Nice space…
What kind of help are you needing and how often? I'm just down the Rd from this shop about 7 miles.
My favorite builds are definitely the Rudicon and the Comanche
Keep on Jeeping 👍🏻🇦🇺
I am very pleased that you are going to continue.   I really enjoy your videos.
So excited to see what's coming!
🇦🇺👍🏻Tasmania
I enjoy any of your fabricating videos, as well as the rescue videos. Good to see that you are moving into larger space. I'm patient. Get moved and creative again. I'll be waiting.
No no it’s not
Carry on Rudy you will be fine. Life is a unfinished product , get the big jobs done before your bones and joints give out.
New shop looks great Rudy. Looking forward to more videos.
Glad you are working things out… that’s life!   Love you and hope to see much more.  Thanks
SLURP, I had to sell my 1966 Chevrolet k25 w/factory air. I want to see the C-10 go on the suburban.Also time lapse the new shop build as that is lengthy.
IME the thing that takes way more time than you'd expect, and becomes a chore, is editing videos.  Rudy at least has a source for excellent advice, and maybe a helping hand as his dad has a team of three editors.    BTW Rudy, did you remember to turn that fridge back on?
Do Collin's C10 first, hook little brother up
Don't apologize. I work 48+ a week, have a 50min commute each way, and still have to make time for family and hunting. I barely get time to watch videos, let alone make them..! As long as you put God first and family second I promise your life will be Blessed!
1. Rudicon  2. Comanche  3. C10
Thanks for letting us know! We are just glad that you are still wanting to make more videos. Frequency is not important. Do less and enjoy what you do makes a better video than stressing to make content. Looking forward to your new space and future content.
Comanche First!!!
Can’t wait to see the projects finished. I like them all! All are so different which is cool!
I’m confused (not hard to do), but is your “regular job” AND RAD moving to the new shop?
With so much on your plate, we will take what we can get. Nevertheless more is better
Congratulations!!! Always eager for you videos whenever you can post. Looking forward to your seeing your adventures
Rudy, we do understand, (at least some of us do), just how much time it takes to produce good content. And it takes time to get to the point where YT pays the bills. Please do not over reach and try to do more than you can comfortably do. We will watch what you put out because you are good people and make fun and interesting videos. I loved the adventuring videos as much as I do the fabrication videos. But YOU are what make it all enjoyable. Take care of yourself and the rest will come. God Bless my friend.
Congratulations to the new job and hoping for more videos Rudy we miss you man.
i want a built commander with a cummins diesel !
Now I'm hungry for a sandwich! Dang right you have skills, Rudy!
Good luck Rudy looking forward to the new stuff
No worries Rudy, you rock! Looking forward to what you come up with, you have cool idea’s
Cool!,,,,,
It’s great your keeping going. But that video was ultra confusing. Your shop, not your shop. You still working for someone? Title Last video. Not your last video ?
Pissing away instant followers from Matt's channel....
Like others have said it takes time be patient you're not gonna have a million subscribers right off the bat load the videos as you can that's all. Don't stress out because you don't have a huge channel like Matt, fabrats or mischief maker.  And realize those are pretty hard acts to follow. Please take your time at least you're smart enough to realize that you burn yourself out.  don't do that Anymore.  Remember Matt got burned out also...... And he went from a bumbling Tongue tied host  To now he's doing a pretty good job
You need to get into miny bikes of somesort
Thank you Rudy for update information. Can’t wait to see your next video. Your a very talented person.☺️☺️☺️☺️👍👍👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Good luck Rudy!! And well, how much I wanna see the Rudicon all dun, the C10 project is very intriguing!!!
You  hireing, I'm 45 union welder,fabricer,  live in Kansas now but thinking of a change of life
Rudycon! Number 1 to complete. Don’t pressure yourself, we understand time constraints. Just have fun!
It doesn’t happen overnight.  We await your projects… a different use of a jib crane thou… but your young!
Keep making what you can make and we will enjoy watching them! I’ve never tried what you’re doing but I hope it’ll get easier for you as you go. My favorite is the Rudi-con.
Finish the Rudicon because it is a useful vehicle for your dad which is guaranteed footage and exposure.  That Comanche could be a KOH racer?  Finish your brother's truck after the Rudicon so he has a useful rig for parts an materials soon also.   I am into CAD (both cardboard and computer) and that is an avenue where you might be able to manufacture something(s) on your own. Even just cutting gusset plates and small items like that can generate some revenue for you easily since you have all your own advertising right here.   Hollie's gas tank basket looked great so even cranking out custom stuff like that would be cool to see.
Thanks for the video, always enjoy watching!
All good
Welcome back. Looking forward to seeing your projects come together
That Comanche looks sick I’ve always wanted one  I’m sure you’ll make a cool built
👌🤓
Rudy-con and commanche!
We will wait for you. Thanks.
Rudy you keep doing you sir. Love the content you put out.
I thought Colin was going to say "you made me hungry", instead of "that's a good analogy". LOL
Rudy I appreciate your content so much please don't stop posting!
Very cool Randy . Will keep watching.  I'll never give up on you.
We get it we understand. We just wait for more to come out. Is I enjoy watching your channel.
We’ll watch you make a sandwich any day of the week. Don’t get your knickers in a not. We’re not going anywhere.
Good to see you back. Looking forward to seeing more videos 📹.
Rome wasn’t built in a day. Follow your dreams wherever it takes you. Don’t worry about making it high quality to start if you choose to be a YouTuber. You have enough people who watch and support you that things will come along. Take care of yourself first. 🤙🏻
Congratulations
C10 and after that the commanche, but it' needs an Hemi :D
Most of us aren't going anywhere. Just do what you have to do. Waiting for the next video. 👍
Awesome to watch you grow. Best wishes for continued success. Stay safe and happy.
New content from Rudy!!! All I can say is, "RAD!"
Like many others have said and you clearly called out, a 1 man show is hard to transition from a full time job. It will all happen when it's ready.
Great turn of events Rudy , can't wait for more..
You gotta finish your brothers truck first, listening to his story he deserves it.
Good job Rudy !
Ya bud !! We miss u but life can get in the way of fun too we understand post as u can we will always be here to watch and nice shop bud!!!
Ahh, I was wondering why you'd been quiet for a while.
Never noticed that you were gone... ha ha 🎉
Keep ur head up u can put more video out for us
What do u need for the grill and the light off the burmen
Awesome
This is gonna be cool.
C-10!!
I hear ya, brother. I'm working a full time job while trying to start my handyman business and raising our niece and nephew. Not much time for the business but working on the prep for when I'm ready. I'd rather be overly prepared than diving head first into something that may not be guaranteed. Thanks,  bye for now.
Rock and roll Rudy, your doing it grass roots. I watch every video you create. Love the fab work. Love the adventure. Love your honesty on the trials and tribulations of making a go of it.  The road to success has many twists and turns in it.
Colin's truck first, then 1/2 done
CONGRATS! AWESOME!  GOOD LUCK!
Can't wait to see the new shop when you're moved in, that's every fabricator/mechanics dream!  I'd love to see the Comanche done first, that's a rare bird!  Second is the old Chevy and lastly the Rudicon because it's already a runner.
When ever the videos come out, ill watch em. 👍
Take your time young man! Rome wasn't built in a day! We'll be here as you put them out. Wish you the best of luck!
Keep it up man! Looks like things are coming together nicely
Keep them coming you do projects like I can do on a budget
I am so jealous of that view you have in the background.
Congratulations!
Congratulations
I enjoy watching your videos so I have missed them, but don't stress too much about video frequency. I think most of us understand video making is a lot of work, and without a team to help you out on top of doing your regular job it's easy to see why you would get burned out, I know I would. As long as you enjoy doing what you're doing and post in a manner that's reasonable with your life I have no complaints. Looking forward to your upcoming projects!
nope....rejected
RUDY!!!
Missed your videos. Really glad to see you are going to continue.
It dont matter if you post every day, week, month, or year. but when you do, we will be here to watch.
Thanks for the update 👍😀
I would set up multiple cameras instead of moving one.   Editing is a nightmare for most, it’s like a full time job for many, takes a ton of time.    You have to have a life too.
I love your videos
Comanche !!
Pop one in when you can.  No apology needed.  You’re young and your subject matter can be very expensive unless you’re located next door to a junk yard and then you’re just junk.
I started following you because of the commanche but I look forward to seeing what you do in the new shop.
Sounds like you thought you’d just make a YouTube and have your dads success and ease overnight.  It takes time.  Most people in your shoes don’t have a following from their dads channel that jumped over to their new channel.  It takes hard work man.
That’s awesome Rudy, good luck on this new beginning
Excellent 🎉
C10 Swap !
Never apologize for doing the best you can do
Rudy, whatever you produce I'll watch. Keep on truckin.
I would like to see you all finish Colin’s truck first!  Are videos when you can and we will watch🤗👏🏻
Let's go 🙄
Happy to see you back!! .....and with more on the way!!! Was wondering where you'd been!!!! Keep 'em comin'!
@Rudys Adventure and Design - Doesn't Janelle & Collin help film?
Best of work to you Rudy.  You have a young man’s drive and opportunity.  Small steps in the right direction for a long time.  Be nice.  Be you.  I like you!
looking forwar5d to it.
Awesome update, congrats, can't wait to see the progress!
Good to see you back.  I'd love to see the Rudicon Full Dun. :)
Really ugly people
If you post an activity without EDITING, you will still attract followers.
Wait a sec... There is something called "finishing a project" you gotta explain how this is done...
Finish Colin's truck first...!!!!
I was already starting to worry if you were still okay but understandable you also have a life besides YouTube you are doing well and hopefully we will see you again soon
Your analogy made me hungry! 😁
Cant wait to see
My vote is for completing the Rudicon.  You deserve to have it done and ready for fun on the trails.
Look, I will still be subscribed to your channel... When you decide to come back and make more videos, I'll still be here...!!!
I literally just rewatched all of your videos last week. Congratulations on the new space! Looking forward to more videos! Do you have a P.O. Box or mailing address? I have a box I’d like to send you.
Happy for you but please do not make the mistake that a lot of YouTubers make and that is to make just content because you need content.  Make cool things that You like and you'll aways have guys or gals tuning in.
Yeah, I think most people reach that point in their life.  It can be a lot.  The last thing you want is to look back on your life ava realize you never gave yourself time.  Good luck and I think we will all be here when you release your vids.
dude i almost was gona ask your dad where you were happy u r doing well. keep it up bro
Are you still working for your employer friend?  Is the new shop your new full time job?  Sorry, for the questions.
Yoooo I would love to see the Comanche finished !
I'd like to see the Rudicon done first. Then the C10.
C10
Do the C10
Mate, your stuff is worth the wait...
Understand completely, my choice of order of builds; Comanche, C10 then Rudicon.
Wow! Nice new place, great to have people like that in your life that give you this opportunity to share that space!
🤘🏼🇺🇸
RUDY ROX!! keep on keepin' on
Rudy, rots rov ruck !!!
Congrats!!! You deserve this opportunity. Love your channel!!! From Connecticut
Congratulations Rudy, keep moving forward. It will all get done in your own time. Keep up the great content , cheers 🇨🇦
Thank you for all your hard work. Hopefully more sandwiches to come soon 🙂
Looking forward to all the upcoming projects. I liked and subscribed
Love the new shop can't wait for more of your new content
I would order Rudicon, Colin's truck, finally Comanche.   Just cause order started...
Its all cool when you are ready  Rudy.  Gerald, NZ.
Love your stuff. I just wanna see your projects. Congratulations on the new shop
I'd really like to see the C10 finished, though I'm down with whatever.
Your Goodyear's maybe harder than the Patagonia tires, causing them to slip more on rocks? I notice sometimes the Rudicon 's powered steering  squeals. My expedition squealed until I put Lucas Power steering stop squeal and leak in.I notice most of your  tow customers power steering squeal ,in the sand!!! I know mud, snow, fresh worked dirt, not sand!!!
I thought we broke up and you forgot to tell me. LOL
hey, do what you can do, we'll be here looking forward to seeing it when you can.
First off, I just want to say that I think you are the greatest Rudy, and your brother as well, and have been subscribed since just after you started out on your own.  Just like your Dad, you have an enormous personality, and presence.  I do my own videos as well, and also do all my own edits and producing...  I also have a job which gets in the way sometimes of getting out what I would like, so I understand the time, effort and struggle it takes to keep it all together, but you do it very well.  I am so excited every time I get the opportunity to produce a new video and have another one coming up that I am very very excited about.   BUT - there is a second part of this comment that I would like to address now - and with fear of probably offending someone...  I first read through the comments to see if anyone else had mentioned this first, but I couldn't find any, and maybe it is with good reason because people just like you Rudy - as do I...  There is one thing that is a huge pet-peave (if I spelled that correctly) of mine, and that is this...  I don't lie to anyone and I can't stand it when someone lies to me.  I have un-subscribed from so many channels lately because click-baiting has gotten way out of hand.  Rudy - I truly enjoy watching your content, you are a super super guy, and look forward to seeing you and your brother working together as I love working with mine when given the chance, but believe me, you do not have to lie to anyone to get us to watch - - - because we already know that we want to watch - and that is because - - - it is you...  I am saying all this as I would say it to a friend.  I know - when people talk about click-baiting they get slammed by everyone it seems - because (why should it bother you?, or... Get a life etc. etc.).  It is so easy to get started down that road but your better than that Rudy.  Click-baiting is for people that don't have enough personality to get people to watch them any other way, so they have to trick us into watching to get views, and that is what this video felt like for me - I felt like you tricked me into watching a video I didn't want to see, but I DID want to see it - because of who you are and what you stand for.., and to think that I almost missed this video and your excitement, - simply because of the title - but I wasn't going to let that stop me - at least until I could have this discussion...   I know that I will have probably just offended someone - or someones with this comment but I truly truly hope not, as we need each other's honesty to feel that we belong to something much much bigger than ourselves.  All I am asking is to please not start down the road of click-bait, it isn't you.  Love the new shop and vibe that it puts out - and that is the vibe of Rudy.  ...And like it has already been said - no apology needed for sure - we do what we can when have the time to get it done, and we (as your audience) will be only too excited about seeing the finished product/video/s.  Some times we need to go thru a little ridicule - to help someone - a friend - know they are beginning to step out of character.  All I am asking Rudy is that you just think about it..., and also that this is the first and the last time that I will bring it up, but I just felt it was something that I needed to say.  I wish you well Rudy in your "adventures" that is for sure.  I hope this sounded ok as it is very hard to convey true understanding in a text.  I do much better in person LOL...
Well you work with your little brother sometimes, so it's not all bad😆   Your dad is busy putting out content, so that makes up some of if.  We all know how juggling a full time job along with other things goes. It will be interesting to watch Collins C10 build😆 When is your next appearance with your dad?  I think i saw Collin in one just recently?
it is called burning the candle at both ends  .
Good luck you have the drive to make it go,
rudicon first
Hey, movin'n out, movin' in and movin' up, lets see some adventures Rudy.
Comanche is sick
Growing up is tough enough. Looks like you are doing a great job of it, though. But, then comes love  . . and marriage . . and a baby carriage.  👍 You will never have MORE time.
Congratulations Rudy! We'll be waiting. Love Colins truck
I like the Comanche build the best!
Mate, id watch ya driving to work with scenery like that 😂, keep up the good work..
Jib crane! Nice.
How about a good lifted Jeep Wagoner ... OlllllllO ...Make it out do your dads morvair ..
The surprise was fantastic, congrats on landing that! :D
Love your content, and happy to watch whatever you post, whenever you post
Best of luck rudy...
Pfft, you needn't apologize... I'd rather have solid content once in a while than no content at all.  Just let it play out organically and see what works for you.
cool shop  maybe have a partner to help?you make the videos and have mom do the editing? good luck with that! your brother will be good to help?
One day and a time Rudy.   You’ll get there   Good things happen to good people.   Keep up the good work.
teach Colin to edit
hell yeah
C10
Whatever videos you can produce will be great. Don't worry about how often. You have some avid followers. Best of luck. BTW, like the hat you sent.
quality vs quantity my friend.
Word of advice from a viewers perspective, we like to see finished projects, think you need to actually finish the Rudicon and no make promises of other builds until you finish the last.
Awesome sir
Ok, jeg tilgir deg Bare lag mer når du har noe godt å vise da!
Your Dad will keep us all entertained while your busy . Glad to see your doing great and have really great future plans.😊
Sounds like you've got your plan in place. Looking forward to seeing what you do with the new shop space.
Good luck Rudy!
Finish the rubicon Bro, it’s so cool!
Finish the Rudicon first!
C-10,C-10,C-10,C-10....ohh then maybe the C-10 lol .
Don’t apologize, just make new whenever you could
Totally understand. I think what you do, how you do it is incredible. Amazing you put as much out as you do. I have enjoyed every second you produced, and I will still tune in when every you do produce a video. Thank you soooo much.
I kind of guessed that you were getting a shop of your own!  That is great with the projects you have going! The Rudicon needs to be finished first!
No apology needed. We all know that it takes a lot to do these vlogs. Go for the C10. It would mean a lot to both of you to work on it together. Especially when you get older and life takes you in different directions.
Keep up good work man
Pick a post frequency, halve it and stick to it.  So if you think you can do one a week, do one a fortnight.  If you think you can do one a fortnight, do one a month.  You can then do the videos at a pace that won't burn you out, and the extra capacity allows you to get ahead. That allows time for some to take longer than expected and means that once you have some in the bag ready to go you can take a holiday without the videos stopping.  As for which car, finish the rudicon first. It's been half done for long enough...
Mmmmm....sandwiches
Do the C-10 FIRST!!!!! Cmon Man!! It's your brother!!!
My favourite build Rudy:  YOUR FUTURE! :-)  Keep going!
Looking forward to the videos! And definitely the COMANCHE 😎👍
Sounds like you're advancing, now for the projects. Do your brothers first, and you'll have help for the Rudicon, which is next. Then the next one. I forgot what that is. I think that's the way to go and you'll feel comfortable while doing it.
Love the videos, will watch whatever you post, you are progressing, YAY! That's just interesting in itself!
Thank you for all your effort. Chase your dreams!
If you are making sandwiches. I’ll take one.
This is good stuff!  Congratulations!
Some of the best youtubers only post a fractional amount of videos a year, quality is always better than quantity.
New shop!! No need for the breakdown but it is much appreciated Rudy.   My favourite build is the Comanche but i cant wait to see Collins truck dropped and doing burnouts 🔥🔥🔥
Shame you still aint in MORR you were a huge part there and missed immensely. good luck on your new venture you deserve all the success in the world.
Life happens...  Gotta pay the bills first, unless you're independently wealthy, lol.  Kool on the new space, hope it works well, & if the content is a bit rough, so what, we'll still watch, lol...  Good luck, & Thanx !
Good to get an update on you, I was already worried 😅-Whatever you are tackling next, good luck and I'm sure it will be RAD ! 😎
Don't burn yourself out for just us, keep up a work/life balance. Only work to live, you only get one shot at this world, there is no take 2. Enjoy your youth, family and friends while you may.
No need to be sorry sir, work comes first, we'll all be here when the videos come back up, congratulations sir
Thanks for the up date wish you well in the new shop, your dad needs a flat bed, mite make a few bucks there.
And as I watch this I'm eating a sandwich 🤣
Way to go Rudy. You gotta start someplace and this is it. I for one am not bailing out on you. I am excited to see what comes next.
i'd like to see the final form of the Rudicon.
Everything starts somewhere
Congrats..I would like to see the Rudicon..but happy with anything
Much Love Ruby
Creator burnout is real, across the spectrum. Youtubers with millions of viewers feel it too. And you can apologize to anyone on Patreon, but us freeloaders don't need an apology, you owe us nothing. I too know the pain of filming/editing a project being murderous to progress.    - You can't just work on anything. You have to give the best view to the camera, which means you, who's working on it, have to settle for the second best view.    - You can't just move around and try something a different way. You have to move the camera, change the lighting, set up the new shot, try it, undo it all and go back to the first way.    - You can't just think about your project, you have to always think about filming it, and that's mentally exhausting to juggle all those things in your head.   I made a few really successful videos 10 years ago, filmed and edited a dozen more, and half-filmed probably 30 others, and each time I reached a point where I just stopped and said "No, I would rather get something done than get videos done." People who asked me for advice and copied my build plans went on to have 10M+ subscribers and careers out of Youtube, so it's not like content was my problem.  ... In terms of what project to start, I'm in favor of the feelgood of wrapping up loose ends, generally chronologically. So the Rudicon first. Also, since it's already a half-hearted build, you can make your filming/editing mistakes on that. Something like the C10 you want to be a bit more polished for.
Congratulations on the new shop can't wait to see what you will do. Stay safe my friend
I sure do miss those mountains in the background! the old stompin grounds never disappoint. Glad you found more space to work and I’m excited to see all the projects! Keep up the good work!
Rudy, I Need a little clarification. As I understand you. You work 40 hours at your day job. Then you have been working at RAD doing projects. And with the editing and such it has been to many hours/work. Now, you have a new shop that you just said you're going to be finishing projects and putting out content. So, what has changed? I don't get the point of this video?   Are you quitting your day job and going full-time RAD? Or are you going to do the samething, and working at your day job and do projects in this new shop?   Is the new shop yours? Renting? Leasing? Barrowing?
Love your builds. Take your time man!
C10, than 1/2 DONE and than what you want!
Rudicon is the og! Gotta finish that up! 😊
If you can not do it  Don't.
congratulations Rudy. keep up the hard work .
All the best with new shop look after your self we watch u when u post   The c10 build
No need for an apology Rudy. Adulting sometimes has to be the priority.  As for which project to tackle out of the C-10, Rudicon or Comanche my choice is YES. 😉  All 3 are cool and either one could be the choice.
Finish the Rudicon, then the Comanche then the chevy. Please don't slam that chevy, it's far too rare and in decent shape to bag it.
I wondered where you'd disappeared to. 🤷‍♂️
RAD man, good luck with the new adventures!!!!!!
pretty sure most of the people who are watching are also busy af. Don't worry about rigid schedules. jealous of that shop though, pretty cool setup.
Rudicon or the C10? It's a toss up for me I have a 99 2dr XJ and a 66 shortbed c10 so Tie ball game for which one I like most. Love the channel and wish you luck with getting everything straight.
No worries, life happens. Super stoked to see that huge space and the possibilities that come with it. As for favorites, they are all really cool so it’s hard to pick one. I am leaning towards the Comanche however because it seems like a unique build.
Hey Rudy, I'd like to see you finish the Rudicon so when you want to go wheeling in the rocks or dunes all you have to do is get in it and go. Keep it inside where you can work on it when you need to and when your finished also keep it in there to keep the thieves at bay. Blink makes some good cameras.
You build & make video - I’ll watch. Subscribed.
So - Holly and Walter (Mischief Maker) get a new shop so you have to? (lol) Next you will be like Adam LZ and get you a big compound with 5 shops including a paint booth and a house!
Where did you get the black eye
Dude! Don't worry about it! Just take your time and keep making your content in your own pace. We'll wait. 😀
Keep going as you can!
No apologies needed, take your time, go at your own pace, and remember: following the footsteps of others just means you won’t leave a trace of your own
No apologies bud. You’re true fans will be here to watch. And I’m one of them. Can’t wait brother
I don’t care about how often you upload I just enjoy the videos when they come out. sure it’s nice to have a new video every week but if it’s every couple of weeks whatever
Hey Rudy, I had to pause the video to come straight here and comment. As much as viewers sometimes feel entitled to content from creators, you don’t owe us anything. While it would be super sad if you never made another video, it would be 100% okay. You don’t owe us anything. But you and the efforts you make of creating and producing content, are much appreciated, and we look forward to future content if you decide to continue!
Rudy, lighten up on yourself. You needn't apologize for anything......beyond not giving me the jeep truck! It's clear thats your boss's shop and your content is created after hours. I know first hand how much time it takes to shoot/cut a segment. That word should give you a hint about what I did. Keep doing you Rudy!
Rudy - we just love your genuine straight forward style.  You've got tons of talent and are simply working your way through this stuff.  We aren't going anywhere - do your stuff, take your time and post when you can!  Finish the Rudicon!
People don't understand how much goes into shooting and editing... It takes me 6-8 hours to cut and edit 10 minutes... And we aren't millionaires who can spend all day doing that...
An adventure ahead! Making wise choices comes first! Post videos as time allows! Will watch as they pop up!
So about these sandwiches.... roast beef, ham, or ????  Looking forward to following your progress... with, or without sandwiches.
Keep it up !
In your own time Rudy…you certainly do not need to apologise.
Good luck here Rudy
rudicon
cool!!! It's going to be exciting to watch! Put out 2 vids a week, you will grow like mad! Do the rudicon!!!
Love to see more videos but we all get it other things get in the way etc.... I get its a joint workspace but a shop build out would be cool
WOOHOOOO!   Hello Rudy , I am looking forward to all of your videos.  I think that I was subscriber # 57 when you started your channel.  So I am subscribed and the bell has been rung for a while now.  Wishing you all the very best!
Don’t worry Rudy, I’ll hang with you and just take the videos you put out whenever you do….
Welcome back... lots of juggling to keep everyone happy.... but stay HAPPY yourself FIRST.... HOLY Smokes.... finish the Rudicon first so it will be All-Done... then the the truck swap.... keep the project small and manageable.... and again.. WELCOME back!
Wishing you the best. Will definitely watch when you release a new video.
The Shot Creek Shop! Congratulations and don’t give up. We love your content!
Matthew 11:28-29  28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.  29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
SOOOO excited for you bro!  Being the content!!!
John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that whoever believeth in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life.
I wish I could come work for you. I'm very talented.. well so I say Take care and enjoy..best wishes
😊😮❤❤ that was spooky .glad it’s working out for you
Congratulations!!
Man you don’t have to do a complete project to show us. Just the daily grind and wot gets done is fine. That is real how you work with friends family and people you meet. How you as a young person are dealing with the challenges you face and how you deal with them. I would watch if you were only doing a couple of videos a year!
I've been making videos for 9 years just as a fun little side hobby. Being a dad and having a demanding full time career leaves little time for making content and editing. I get it man and don't sweat it. Like a lot of folks here I'm subbed because I enjoy the content and don't mind whatever upload schedule you can mange. Cheers and God bless from Missouri
I got burned out & depressed earlier this year & deleted my entire channel. None of my videos were backed up, so I threw away a lot of content. (200+ vids) DO NOT DO THAT!!! But sometimes you just gotta take a break & regroup.
Family First, finish your brothers truck.  Make him help you.  What he will learn in the process will be a big help to you on future projects.
Would love to see the C10.
Lucky man... crack on mate!
Sure have miss your channel Rudy!  Very nice shop!
finish the rudicon for yourself and then do kolins  c10
😎🇺🇸
Your viewers will remain faithful Rudy. Just do what you need to do and we'll be waiting. 👍🇨🇦👍
hey, good to see ya ;man that space....to die for, or live in maybe
Good thing I ate a sandwich watching this video
I feel your pain I used to video my son’s high school marching band, and the bands that were within he marching band on competition days as well as other performances, each band was a different segment. Competitions  we’re on Saturday (up 16 hours) Sunday was editing (up to 10 hours) they all were requested to done by Monday Tuesday the latest, I did it for 6 years (yes my son graduated on time) Friday’s were prep days picking up the band trailer and loading it (up to 4 hours) so I know and understand the work that can go into what looks like a simple video. Looking forward to videos and appreciate the efforts it take to make them.
I was just wondering if you were going to be doing any more videos. thanks for the update and glad to see you back.
Excited to hear more videos to come.
Ya can only do what ya can do!
I like the Comanche and the Rudicon, i.e. the XJ based projects. :-)
You should Raptor the Rudicon, no shiny paint job. Make it a beast. You can easily paint it with Raptor paint yourself for cheap. Finish it up. Dove gray that comes with Raptor body liner would be perfect for it, that is what I did my 2000 XJ with.
Wow! Now finish the Rudicon.
Maaaate!!!!
Welcome back missed you, looks like you are doing good
Hey Rudy, I am interested in running a camera and editing. I'm also interested in wrenching and fab work.   I am currently up in Missoula, but considering a move.  Just sayin'.....😉
Dude, I know how you feel.  Trying to build a channel while working full time is brutal.  You've got a great start though... love the Comanche build BTW.
Please start with the C10 swap. Would love to see that.
GOOD LUCK
That building looks like it used to be a church judging by the arches, that should be inspirational in my opinion, this is a rough time in our nation's history to start a business because the democrats are the anti business party, they despise individualism and want everyone to be subservient to the government.
You make videos, we’ll watch ‘em! I hope to live long enough to see you displace McFarland. This video was your best video to date. On a scale of 1 to 100, it was a 100. The best part of it was you trying to hide that grin… that kinda attitude is infectious. Keep it up! Can’t wait for the next one.
Make videos on YOUR schedule.
Don't be ashamed of tryin...and while supporting yourself and others thru your services....keep at it...
Nice man, congrats.
looks promising Rudy I'm most interested in what your doing to the Comanche but also following Collin"s Chevy but why go 2wd if you're putting it on a suburban frame anyway
Everything in its time. God Knew What He Was Doing When He Included Ecclesiastes In His Owners Manual For Life; Aka, The Bible, aka, Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth. As Always, May God Bless you and yours!
Hang in there Kiddo... "You Got This" No Regrets, No Apologies necessary !!! We enjoy any content you can get us !!!
Its all good. Don't forget to take time for yourself. We'll watch them when they come out
Take care of your Brothers truck first! Family rocks! keep moving forward.
Thanks for the update.  Looking forward to seeing where life takes you.
Now I’m craving a sandwich:)
Fantastic!! We have been missing you and it's great to hear you're picking up steam. Can't wait to see Collins truck and the Rudicon finished!
It's awesome to see you grow. I lost my son when he was 21 he was a lot like you. You are very talented and you're putting your priorities in the right order.
Can’t wait for the c10
Good Luck Rudy....looking forward to see the new content and adventure's ...at your own pace...👍
I'll take a sandwich 🥪
Happy for ur new space just build some stuff.  Can u do a complete junk build for something just for dumb fun
I had thought your girl friend helped with the videos. Doing it solo is a lot of work and time!
It's all good. But, I must off missed something, cause, I just watched a video you posted a month ago, and some of the other channels I follow, post once a month, so, yeah.
Awesome.   We get it!!!   We love you!!
Youngster, Life is what happens when your busy making plans. Behind you 100% on whatever you decide to do. And from one redhead to another. When you look in the mirror one morning and see a white hair in your beard, Don't pluck it..leave it alone.. three more will come to its funeral. And the next thing you know, you're beautiful red beard will become white like mine. I found that out at 30 years old. Enjoy your content immensely. And look forward to any and all future videos.
All best Rudy
take your time man you can't rush good content when ever you post you post we can wait even if its a video a month
I have a channel as well, i find it fastidious. That might be a better word to describe content creation. Fastidious.
Dang, seems like endless posibilities and lots of fun in the new shop
Kool can't  wait to see what you do.
about time... RUUUUUUDDDY!!! lol..
Definately be nice if the Rudicon was more then "1/2 done". I thought that when you started the Comanche. Thanks for the update.
1st : Rudicon, then C10 then and finaly Comanche
You go Rudy! I have always wanted a Comanche. Really liked that video. Keep up the good work!
I say get the Comanche at least a functioning 4 wheel drive and get the door to shut properly. Lol. Then get the C10 on a new frame and spend some time on that making good videos with your bro. Once you can yard drive the C10 on the new frame then do some Rudicon videos to keep us up to date on that. And don’t fret about burning out, you never know you’re heading that way till you get there. Lol. Just a learning experience. Your positive attitude is and inspiration. Keep up the great work!
Rudicon, I followed you here to see what you'd do with it.
C10 build. I wanna do something like that anyways. Oh, no need to apologize for having a life.
Very kool Rudy Congrats on the new building
I thot it was the jeep truck but now the c10!! Love ya buddy! Keep up your normal life cause we think it’s cool shit!
1.Rudicon 2. Colin's C10 3.. Comanche  In that order. Keep it up Rudy
The Rudycon because u did alot of it with your dad
Gracious seems like a great word to describe yourself Rudy. I, as I suspect most of your viewers really appreciate your great content, whenever you get a chance to post it, we don’t judge you based on frequency of posting, it’s the quality of the story you present.. your channel is much appreciated.
🤔 Let's see, which project do we like best. The Rudicon, the Chevy or the Comanche? Hehehe, the answer is all of them😁
Your health is #1 bud. Dont burn yourself out. We all love you, take your time balance your off time and work. Might take awhile longer but youll get it all done.. im sure eventually this will be your full time gig.. anyways take care, lots of love from Saskatchewan!
Getter done!! And keep it real. I would think we ALL understand.
Yeah but why we don't see you in events and activities with your dad?
Congrats on the new shop cant wait to see what you get done
good luck brother Rudy =)  you dont have to apologize for living your life =)
Ok stretching your wings a little bit there young man got to exercise before you can begin flight. But I did know that towards the end of the video that you do have a swing to play on in the new building.
We ain't no Wimmen that get all mad when something doesn't happen the second we want it. I'll be here to enjoy whenever you have time to share!! Awesome on the shop and Colins' truck!!
Question on new shop.  What is rating on swivel hoist?  I am about to have a steel building built, and want something like that installed.
We are with you Rudy when you have time to put something out we will watch it
Wow a youtuber with a day job.  Very unusual.  You ought to try doing all that, with a channel that isn't instantly populated with 200,000 subscribers that came from MORR and youtube throwing money at you.
Congrats Rudy !! hope it works out for you, I will be looking out for new content
You have to balance your marriage, your regular job and your YT channel and I think most of us understand that.   Looking forward to seeing your new shop come together and the new content to follow.
The C 10 all the way!
Faith hereby sent to Rudy from Norway!! . . . . I also have patience! Don't burn yourself out.
203K subscribers 💰💰💰
Your videos are much longer and more detailed than many other YouTubers so we just appreciate when you put out an interesting video!
When people put that sort of title on a video, it's normally completely false....
Life happens . Just keep your head up n things will fall into place
Looking forward to the new content 👍👊
dont stress, enjoy the journey.
YO! CONGRATS on the new shop location! Also. Burnout is real. Figuring out a balance is key. Take care of yourself Rudy. No matter how slow the videos come out I'll watch. Much love.
Need to get the Rudicon up to 3/4 done!!  And don't worry about video content  we're here to watch when you post!!
😲😲👏👏👍👍👊👊🏆🏆🙏🙏
CONGRATS on the New Shop! Thanks for Sharing your life with us!
Like its been said, working a full time job with overtime, trying to accomplishment a you tube channel, if WE do not understand how hard that is, WE   , are wrong. Plus maybe family coming,freinds etc,.. YOU NEED  TIME TOO. We will still be here watching.
apologies for being on youtube - downvoted
I cant wait to see more content on the comanche . Ive always wanted one !
Awesome!!!
1 passionately made video beats 100 obligatory videos any day. Some of my absolute favorite creators on youtube only post a handful of times each year.   Enthusiasm is infectious, and that's what I look for in the content I consume. If less frequent videos can keep the stoke high and the burnout at bay I'm all for it. Props for taking care of yourself, Rudy
Thanx for the update....not concerned so much for content upload but more about you. Glad to see that you're okay and finding some direction. You deserve good things.  Take care...c ya next time.
C-10
Can't believe that you didn't go to SEMA. Everyone was at SEMA. Not Rudy. No no no.
Looking good, You will make it happen!!!!
Keep going broo
You are young and strong. Keep up with it as long as it lasts. These type of things have a life. Get while the getting is good. Some of your relationships will suffer, but make sure the important relationships are a priority. Some of your dads friends don’t get as much time as before, but they also are happy for him.
My only comment is.  I love Rudy.
I have a GoPro for my atv runs, so much work to film and edit. Add content when you can.
👍
Bro.no apologies needed, we’re just great full you share your life with us.. can’t wait for up coming stuff. Love the Comanche build.
Congratulations on the new shop.I like the Rudicon, I think it may need different tires,it slips more on rocks than the banana and moovair! But I was really impressed how it pulled the White Ford Diesel out, with the construction bed!
Hi Rudy. I can’t image doing something you like ( fabrication ), and adding videos to the process. From what I can tell the videos will be the most financially rewarding if it grows well and your personality is great for it. As far as projects is concerned , I think the Rudicon should be the first as it has waited the longest. Your brothers C10 should be next. I think your brother is destined to play a large part in your future success. Best of luck to go with your hard work.
Comanche!
We got you Rudy,  take your time & look forward to what’s next 👊🏽🤙🏼
Keep Grinding Bro, It's Hard When You Are By Yourself, I Know. You Will Have Your Own  5000 Square Ft Shop One Day And It Won't Be Enough...Trust Me!
Wooo  Hoooo  ..  this is GREAT News Rudy..  🤜💥🤛
I also watch Diesel Creek and he only posts about once a week. The wait is worth it,  so is yours and I will wait patiently. A lot that I watch are getting too commercial, buy this, buy that. I grew up in a time when commercials paid for the shows I watched. Since TV has as many commercials at story time I not longer watch TV. This video was enjoyable without commercials but a few are necessary to help finance your operation. Keep on experimenting and you will get it to work out, maybe even pay your help and see how it goes from there. Your content is interesting and that is a good start. Thanks for sharing.
To continue the sandwich analogy... You don't necessarily need to make and eat sandwiches 🥪 everyday, (unless you work at Subway I guess🤔), but every now and then they do hit the spot! Do what you got to do. Watching your content is entertainment, (be it what it may), but you only have 24 hours in a day. Live your life and entertain us when you can...
COMANCHE
A video a week, or a video a month, makes no difference. I like to see the work you are doing, the projects you have and how they are progressing. The project I would most like to see is the completion of the "Half Dun Rudicon" Jeep. Just because every time I have seen it in a video it is always half-done.  Love your videos, and look forward to your next no matter when it is.👍
Congrats Rudy. Great new space. Thanks for taking us along on the adventure.
Awesome news space it'll all work itself out , already love the Chanel 👍👍👍
You post as you can and we'll watch as you develop.
Rudy, take a page out of Fab Rats and work on a few projects at the same time. Paul's never in a hurry and his steady pace keeps things interesting. Glad to see you're back!!!  👍😎👍
Good deal.
Just keep on Keeping on Rudy. It tough to do all that yourself. So hang tough!🤙😎
I'm happy for you rudicon just try to not burn yourself out your too young to be that stressed out the possibilities are endless in that shop the other shop you guys are in had weird layout outside so now you can actually store projects also if your gonna frame swap Colin's truck you might as well make it a short bed an find a short bed they look one hundred times better long beds are just boats
Matt kinda set the bar pretty high, but a lot of people don't realize there is a lot more going on behind the scenes at MORR. For someonw just starting out, on your own ... you are doing GREAT! Personally, I would rather see 1 good video every couple of weeks, moreso than I would want to see more videos, but at the expense of your sanity. :-)  And as for what project I would like to see ... its a toss up between the Rudicon and the Comanche. Knowing how much work you have put into the Rudicon, I would love to see it not be "1/2 DUN" ... but I have great memories of my old Comanche, and would love to see yours finished.
TOUCH MY CAMERA THROUGH THE FENCE!!
The rudicon needs to be forever 1/2 dun! Keep working on it for sure, but keep doing new things to it.
Ruuuuuuuudy!!!
Look to Matt and how he presents to the world. 'Nuff said.
I thought maybe you were secretly building a recovery wrecker for the upcoming olympics!!
I built a wall mounted swing crane like the one you have in the shop.  I put a half circle plate on the bottom and a large drop pin on a cable to lock it in place when working at different locations.  It had an electric winch with electric drive.
DEWD, you're such a pecker.... I totally fell for it, thinking "nah man don't stop". I have really started liking the more grass roots 1 or 2 cam stuff. You, and lt tolman and others. Sweet shop bruh, congrats!
Your boss has been, and clearly is being super supportive. It's hard to come by that kind of support when you're supposed to be working a full time proper job.   Post what you can, when you can. Man I watch some channels on here that post may be once a blue moon! But I still support them.   Start with the easiest project to finish amd finish it, then you can a sense of achievement, then move on to the next one.   Keep it up Ruddy.
Don’t be afraid to publish #shorts under 60 seconds ( as long as it adds to the story )  I agree about the editing , but I love it… maybe you could delegate it. Sketch out a story line, film it , dump footage on a server, let someone else edit and add music ?
C10 build would be great to see…
I’m ready to see the mj manche.
I'm stoked for you on getting a dedicated shop for your builds.  I love all offroad content  but, excited to see the c10  frame swapped and bagged. I love old cars and trucks.  Let's go!!
I would rather you take long to put out a good video then to put out a lot of not so great videos.  Keep up the great work!
Good luck with the shop...
Congrats on the new shop! Look forward to seeing that Commanche built. I have an XJ so of course love the Rudicon also. Just do you, the rest will fall into place eventually.
The shop is sweet!!!  Are you going to keep doing the CAD type work as well?
Love the new space! Great energy! :)
OK MR FANTA PANTS  we see what ya doing derrrrrr the bloke you work for ummmm has a massive youtube channel lol we no hay use it as a hobby thats wat its supposed to be right ? or its another job ? fuck ya sorry just get on with it lol
Read over majority of comments and will agree.  You do you.  It's tough getting started in any business and then to put YouTube on top of that, I can't even imagine.  The video's you have post thus far have been excellent.  I am glad to see this one as I too was worried about ya not seeing anything for some time.  Of course a bit of that was stayed when I saw you on Holli's channel with the cage for the gas tank. Excellect excellent work.  The details in the name were spectacular!  I know you can do it and get things done.  Take the time you need and post when you can.  As all have said here, I will be here whenever the next video posts and will enjoy it as I have all the others no matter what it may be.
Missed your smiling face; happy to know you’re okay. Just do what you do and add content when you can. I want to see the 1/2 dun Rudicon get quasi- finished. We both know you’ll never truly be done. 😉
And, I thought that the surprise was going to be you getting a much needed haircut.💇‍♂️💈
Like your video  keep them going you dont work for your dad
Congratulations on the new "shop" Rudy.  I'd like to see the Comanche  with a Coyote engine and drivetrain on Rockwell to blow Matt's Wrecker out of the water. Good luck and thank you for staying humble. Give yourself more credit sir, you are accomplished already.
Always exciting to have a new BIG shop and work your projects.
Rudy, you owe no one an apology! Live your life dude!
Dang, bro! I don't care if you drop 3 videos a week or 1 a month! I love Rudy's Adventures, and will happily watch when you can post. I'm super excited to see what your able to accomplish in that massive space around your hectic schedule! :D Also, Colin is developing some pretty impressive cameraman skills! ;)
Geez, dude. No apology needed. You have a life, that's easily more important than the youtubes. I mean, I know you want to ultimately produce youtube content, but still. No worries, don't stress. And congrats on the shop space!
Nice find!
A project is never done 😭 good luck
Looking forward to seeing you doing amazing things now love your channel and I will be watching for you in the future thanks for sharing
Awesome!
Life happens , no need to be sorry . True fans like me , just wait patiently. God Bless
why you don't hire me?
So much room for activities
No need for the click bait, I would of watched it if you just said I'm going to surprise you with another sandwich
I vote for the C-10, though all 3 are pretty exciting builds.  Whichever takes the top slot, I'll be here to see the results.
Finish the Rudicon first
I don’t know if it would work out, but I keep wondering if collaborating with Hunter Goodrich would allow for most both combined creativity and individual creativity … and eventually take over the entire space together?
Big changes ahead for Rudy! Love it man, keep being true to yourself
Collins C-10 is the build I’m looking for 🤘
C10, Generally, whenever, whatever.  Rather less frequent and special, than often and dull
Everything always goes smoothly until life gets in the way. No need to apologize, the only reason you're not watching our video uploads is we can't find time to make a video to upload. --- I still have plenty of time to watch your uploads. ---
Quality over quantity! The ones that are put out by people just making videos look just like that. I watch to learn or be entertained, mostly to learn. Quality wins with me every time..
rudy...wheres my sandwich
Rudy a man has to do what he has to. You gotta make a living plus you have a wonderful girlfriend. Make your lives the way y'all see best
I wouldn't mind seeing some of the fab work you do for your friend. ( if he doesn't mind).
but what kind of sandwich is it? lol
Cru Jones is Rad
No worries!  Don't burn yourself out.
definitely understand those are jut growing pains keep up the good work. I would like to see the rudicon finished first. It will set the tone for everything else that comes after. All the best my guy
Yes, we will watch. My first pick will be Collins truck !
NO need apology! Am sooo happy 🎉 to see how you are moving on (and we all have to go thru hard times to move on). Great 💕💕💕love on all your projects & to you … take care of yourself first (a life lesson we keep forgetting). How your dad seems to pace himself is a great example … however you will find your own 🙃
I enjoy your content but please don't worry about how soon you get any of it out to us. we all understand that you have a life we all do too that just gets ahead of us sometimes. happy to see that things are changing for the better, and I'm hoping the best for you. and the more I watch the whole group of you that are associated with each other the more I want to move out to Utah.
I thought you knew how hard things got before you get into the swing of things. Hang in there Rudy. We watch because we like you and want to see you succeed, as well as grow. Watching you grow into yourself is also part of the fun. You have a good start on yourself with a lot of fine qualities. Keep on chugging young brother!
Always interesting to see how people fill their videos. I have yet to accumulate what I consider enough content to feel comfortable enough to even do a monthly drop, let alone a weekly bi or tri weekly drop. Just keep on doing what you're doing even if you have to slow your roll. It should eventually work out to a good presentation. Thanks for bringing us along. Some of the hardest things in life if delegation of duties and tasks. Of course you know what you want and you can always make it come out the way you want but others have different insights.
Take care of yourself first Rudy!! Post what you can when you can and I'll watch it!
Not booze, drugs or loose women? Just work how lame. LOL look forward to your content.
I got you on top notification. I will not miss a video, and I look forward to the next one. I don’t care how long I have to wait. Keep rolling 🤘
Keep doing what you're doing , good things to come from what I see Rudy
Excuses excuses ... you bum hole! :D  Matt doesn't have a problem :p
Keep up.  You do ur best!! Hopefully you can have some good friends to help
I accept your apology!  🌏🇭🇲
Congrats on the new shop space! Work at your own pace, we'll be here!
Click bait
Man nothing to be sorry for. Real life stuff comes first most new youtubers start just like you are. You dont have to hire a crew and just keep the editing quick and real. Someday you can hire a crew keep it basic and fun for now its what got you into this probably. I follow a youtube farmer who does very little editing or things like that. It gives his vids a real life vibe. Either way man have fun making the content and dont stress over a schedule.
Can't wait to see what you do to the Comanche. That is a super cool build
Nice to see you got a big shop for your projects  thats awesome  keep up the good work
Good luck on you
I’ll come to you if you make my “sandwich.” I’ll pay you and film it and edit it. I also have almost all the ingredients already. 🤷🏻‍♂️
do you rudy! we are behind you 100%!
We have missed your video.
Do what is best for you and your family and don't worry about us.  Be Happy and fulfilled.
Remember Rudy sandwiches are not perfect either and everyone knows you are just starting out. So just put out the videos. Keep up the good work man. Glad everything is alright.
Hello Rudy. Great video. I got a question.  I got a 2002 Chevy express 1500 van. Im build into a rv. I want to do a lift on it to pull a 34' camper what kind of truck do i need to get the lift kit to put on my van.
I hate click Bait I was going to watch it anyway but title like this make me not want to watch it
I would like to see the Rudicon 3/4 done.  LOL
Super happy for you Rudy, we'll wait for you no problems with that, keep on filmin', we'll keep on watchin'!!
I like a good sandwich 😂
So glad your still out there... we miss seeing your videos.... excited to see your still working towards a goal.... and hope to see more work on the 1/2 dun Rudicon along with the Comanche and the old C-10
Cool. Building looks great.  So… who’s building is it?   Do you have use of the whole thing or are other people going to work there?   Will you do your day time job there or drive back and forth? Will Janelle continue to be part of the channel? Lastly,  please finish the Rudicon. I’m itching to see it done.
We all are waiting to see more
Hey bub, upload when you can, I'll watch.
Very happy to see you back! It is amazing how life can get in the way of what we want to do. All of your projects are cool, The Rudicon will never be complete, really want to see the Comanche build and I suspect Collin would love his truck completed.
You now when this is going to be a badass channel.
Rudy, good to see you back. That's awesome you have your own shop to work at now and the sky is the limit.
That building dont look tornado safe! :)
As long as what you create/produce is what you're truly passionate about it will never be a failure. As for which projects get done first, #1 the Rudicon. You've done so much already and it serves so many roles. #2 the C 10 cuz it's for your bro. Last the Comanche, and this is my personal favorite of the 3. Congratulations on the new shop space!
Looking forward to some interesting content!
You are not on contract to post videos, buddy, do them when you want !! The new building looks exciting, don't stop !!
Good luck Rudy and don't forget to take care yourself
Sounds like you never had the idea of this being your last video. More like CLICK BAIT.
Makes you appreciate Matt and Paul's channels .eh? you should check out the Tally Ho project(Samson Boat Co,) different genre, but excellent production and editing. But, like the other comments, no worries just be you, we'll watch when you post! Good luck
I wanna see the RUDICON 3/4 Done .
Awesome! I would love to see the C10 build.
I appreciate your candor. I was just wondering where you were on your bros ride
Good luck, Rudy! It's not easy being a content creator, but if you work hard, you will build a great channel.
I’m sure I’m not the only one that feels that it would be great to see all three of those projects documented and completed! Take your time, we’ll wait and watch! Collaborate if you’d like, that would be awesome too! Good luck and look forward to the new content!
That’s Great News Rudy! No worries on how long it takes you, they are always good videos.
Totally understand. Keep the videos coming as you find the time. Don't burn yourself out over it. Thanks
What I’d like to see; finishing the projects you’ve started, in that order 😅
Lmao story of my life, a lot of projects started and none finished. I know your pain. Post when you can, we're here for ya. We all know the struggles of life.
✌😎👍
you are still working for your old boss, so where is the extra time going to come from? You have gained nothing but drive time and debt -- good luck and I hope to see your videos in the future
Nice to hear from you again Rudy,don't feel under pressure to make content just do it when you can comfortably. The C10 frame swap sounds good and the the comanche are my favourite choice,the Rudicon is an ongoing project that you can just keep adding too as you wish so just bring that in as you upgrade it further. Main thing is to look after yourself and enjoy what you do!
Holy crap. That's one of the best reveals of that nature I've ever seen. That space is HUGE!!! Oh, and the rudicon is my favorite.
No need for a apology.. Also, it is refreshing to be aware of brothers enjoying to be around each other. Best to you and yours !
The Comanche build I can't wait to watch always liked those Jeeps
Rudy, no apology needed.  We’ll all be here for your next video!
Don’t stress
Can’t wait to see the C10 coming together!
The Comanche needs to get fi ished Colin's c10 needs to be 4x4 swapped and lifted not kept 2x4 and dropped dropping a truck is ridiculous just lifting a car with big wheels and big tires to look like a truck
LOVE IT! I remember getting my first shop to & getting a lift will help the most. Good luck & will be watching for new videos as YOUR time allows!
Looking forward to your videos...
Good luck with your new adventure! That's exciting and wish you the best.
Finish the Rudicon first. It's more important.
I know all about burn out, no apologies needed! You rock and looking forward to your vids, good luck and all the best sincerely!! 👍
Hey young it is awesome to see you grow. You do you and it will all work out!! Does my old heart good to see a man your age honest and not afraid of work!!
Hang in there.  Enjoy your content.
You could make 1 video a month and I’ll be happy
Oh! Excellent! You are worth waiting for! Love your style, humor and projects!
everyone needs time to work on themselves. love this channel tho keep up the good work ✌😁
The “Rudche”. Can’t wait to see more of the build videos
geeeee    get to work
Please keep trying to put something videos out
Pretty big size buildimg
Upload at your own pase. you have the subs. If you need someone to edit for you, contact me. I would move out there is a heart beat to work with you.
Just keep it coming when ever you can
Looking forward to seeing these projects and the process too completion at RAD.
Dude there one guy I watch only posts once a fortnight and he still has 57.3k subscribers.  Don't feel you have to push out videos just for the views,do it because you want to.  Huge fan of the Comanche build 👌🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Congratulations on the new space.  I will be waiting for your videos.
Looking forward to more videos. You and your brother make a good team.
Good luck 👍
It's about Quality not quantity.  #WhistlinDiesel only puts out maybe 1 video a month, but they're damn good.  Amazing new shop, btw!  I wish I had so much room to work on projects   🤘
Dude there one guy I watch only posts once a fortnight and he still has 57.3k subscribers.  Don't feel you have to push out videos just for the views.
Congratulations
Wonderful .. & quite personal conversation with your fans. Really respect your openness ..thanx! Got me jacked up to see what's comin' -d
Keep at it Rudy.  I would recommend putting on the video that represents the closest finished product.  It is always so gratifying to accomplish a final product which usually motivates us to get to the next thing.  Love your vids.
Rudy ... advice from a pro photographer "don't live your life looking through a lense, sometimes you just need to take it all in."
We would rather see quality videos more spread apart than pointless videos frequently. Quality over quantity baby
A wrecker like your dads, with a cummins.
Oh man congratulations on the shop.    Plenty of room to grow in every way.    Your already at 200k subscribers and 1million won't be too far away.    I dig the rudicon the most.  I got my 2kxj coz of ya'll.   She's going in the shop next week hopefully to have the front end rebuild done.   I'm a mobile technician and no shop to work in.    It kills me to pay someone else to work on my jeep lol
We hand you 203k subscribers on a silver platter for nothing.
Are you renting or buying it i grow up in Colorado city
I think everyone who watches YouTubers regularly should at least try to make a few videos themselves, just to see how much work they are.  Also, I vote for finishing the Rudicon, and it should be painted Rudy-Red.
None of this is news to many of us, dude keep doing what you’re doing.  I enjoy your perspective and presentation.  Take it easy kid.
Right on Rudy, RAD & Collin, hope you guys knock it out of the park, looking forward to your new format and videos. Please…paint your new office to match the RAD design logo, the white screams mental institution, lol.   PS…Rudy Rudy Rudy Rudy Rudy Rudy Rudy Rudy !!!!!  Best of luck
Looks exciting!  This is your life. No one needs an explanation except maybe your mom 😉
Please don’t do the swap. His truck is a classic. Keep it. And get that big car going.
Saludos felicidades con tus pasos firme y siempre que le presente tus pasos a Dios todo marchara bien bendiciones 🇵🇷🇵🇷✌️
No need to apologize, you just keep on being you and doing what you can. Looking forward to the next video whenever it is. Hopefully you can get the rudicon completed
Congratulations on the new shop space! I’m excited to see what y’all do with it!
Am super excited for you and what you have for us in the near future 👍
Dang it Rudy you made me hungry with your sandwich analogy.🤣🤣😂😂🥪🥪🥪 You don't have to say sorry for you living your life. Post when you can.
Quality is worth the wait, we will be here.
Rudy..buddy.. you have your own life ,live it , I like your videos and consider each one a bonus not an expectation . Do what you have to do with no worry
If you want to build a business in that shop you already have a template for a product. If you use the banana as a template, you could build and sell semi-custom off-road machines. Offer a few different standard builds at set prices. Some people will want to go the money to have a "custom" build. Add that to the mix at a premium cost. Between you and Robby Layton you could do an awesome product. . That build process would attract a number of suppliers that would go for product reviews and possibly sponsorships. Don't worry about the frequency of videos. That will come in time.
We want to see Collins pick up
Rudy,keep moving forward,stand and shine with Your work.
Keep it going Rudy we are here for you buddy
Rudy, who owns the building & are you still going to be working a 40-hour job?
Awesome look forward to more!!!!!
* the rudicon will never be “done”. It’s just one of the one types of projects. *the Comanche is super interesting  *the Chevy project is where it’s at. Very different from what you normally do. AND your brother gets his truck done sooner. This should be the focus for a while. Thanks for all of the content.
Finish the Rudicon already!! I really want to see the final product that you have envisioned it becoming to reality please
Welcome back. We patiently wait for the goods
I like the sandwich analogy. Hmmm, I could use a sandwich.
👍missed you. I enjoy your content and want you to enjoy producing it.
Before you know it you will fill that space.. then you'll own the Building .. you'll have too much stuff to move .. lol
Happy to see you back! 😀
Oh yeah, I’m stoked for you on the new shop!
WoW  I like your new shop.
AWESOME Rudy! No worries, enjoy yourself first!
I unsubscribed last week cause you disappeared. 😂 No worries, I just resubscribed.  Says a lot about a dude to be as transparent as you were in this video. I appreciate that.  I vote, get the Rudicon finished.  Then the c10 Then the Comanche.  Also, take it from a dude with ADD, have you ever been tested or diagnosed? It was a game changer for me!
Knock out the rustic on it’s the closer to being finished
AWESOME!! Glad to have you back!! Got a bit worried there, my friend! Looking forward to new stuff, whenever they come. We'll be here anyways! Best regards from Norway! PS. Hire me as your cameraman. I don't need to get payed, I have my pension. There's only an ocean between us. ;)
CONGRATS AND BEST WISHES. WILL KEEP WATCHING!!
Do miss you Rudy and you just keep up the good work you are doing. And I know you have seen my comments on your dad's channel and I'm hoping next summer to come over there and meet y'all and Rudy I got too get my truck running like bit better but it still needs more work done on it and soon as I do and I'm planning to make a long road trip
You make them, we watch them...  no worries.
You have 20000 views in an hour, we're still here. 👍 I would like to see the C10 build. 😉
I'm looking forward to Rudicon going from 1/2 Dun to just Dun.
Keep up the videos really looking forward to seeing your bros truck and the comanche
Man you hav a life off camera live it and we are out here to support your films however close or far apart they are. Your content has been good and enjoyable.
I hate to tell you man, you don't "owe it to" anybody to work for them. You gotta do what's best for you...
You got hired at Subway as a sandwich artist? LMFAO
I’m glad you’re back and doing well it will be great having a place you can work on the fun stuff and enjoyable for everyone else.
Congrats on the new shop.  Looks great!
This clickbait bullshit just lost you a subscriber.
And the Adverture continues. thank You
Collins truck, the  Rubicon, and the jeep pickup
Dude no apologies needed. When you have people who help you out and take care of you then you need to take care of them in return. It's only right. Anyone who doesn't understand that responsibility, well, that's their problem. Always been a fan of yours from your dad's channel. The sense of responsibility and the work ethic you have along with your skills are going to take you places. Some day I hope to make it to Utah and visit your dad's shop and shake his hand and with any luck shake yours too. You guys are good people. Keep it up. Thanks and take care.
No need for an apology. just glad your back. And we appreciate the time you share with us
Rudy your content is always good I would like to see you and Collin build the C10 and leave it the original color light Sand it then clear coat it
I look forward to seeing how all this comes out😁😁👍👍
How do you eat an Elephant ?  One bite at a time.  With that being said. Rudy you do you . We don't need  24/7 videos, don't get me wrong, we would love to see them. So post when you can if you can and guess what we will still be here. I have been in that boat twice....2 jobs one life and a wife, kids and all...See when you post the next one. Either way Thanks and we shall see you soon.
The Rudicon and the C10 were the projects i watched and I'd rank them in that order. But it's close and depends on what needs more work done. Looks like that will be the C10 and I'll watch that
Just do what you have to do.
Glad you're OK first of all.  If the Rudicon is good enough to assist on recoveries then I vote for the C-10 to get worked on first, then the 1/2 done, then the Comanche.  Congrats on the new digs.
Rudy's Adventures is looking like things are about to take off to bew levels. Keep up the good work and take care of yourself.
1/2 Done, needs to be ALL done! (well almost, your never really ever done, there's always more to do on em!)...
All is good you have a life and it comes first then videos keep up the great work 👍🏻
No Apology necessary. #BlessUp
Don't worry about us Rudy.  You have to look out for #1 first and foremost.
Glad you are back!
Relax Calm Down Don’t Stress Take It Easy
Rudicon ... she needs to be finished first. First project and a beast.
Congratulations man,
Take your time, Rudy! We enjoy the vids whenever you post them!
Agree with the commenters here … glad to see all is well ! Do one a month or whatever frequency you like. Your supporters will always support you.  From all your friends in Northern Ireland!!  G…
...I want a sandwich
No need to say sorry your providing entertainment to us so thank you for that I don’t know about everybody else but I’m subscribed with the bell notification on so whenever you post I’ll be here to watch so again thank you sir
I like all your projects but the Comanche is RAD (see what I did there?😂)
Being too busy is a good thing, that means you're moving up and forward. It's unfortunate that the Youtube algorithm likes frequent uploads and a predictable schedule so much. I just want good videos whenever they're ready. I have no expectations of weekly content from anyone. The community tab would probably be a good way to just throw up a picture every once in a while to say "this is what we're working on" or to tease an upcoming video and keep engagement up.
That you find the time at all, for unknown strangers on the internet, to bring them into your very busy life, it’s worlds beyond what most ‘men’ do.  Keep showing us what one man can do.  You are the man that soy boys need to see grow,  just like Matt in that way.  I see you leading a great group of people someday.   I’m grateful for what you.  Heaven will send you an editor shortly after this video. ❤
Probably Collin’s truck
Seems being in Utah... building an offroad heavy record is a must.......... J/K......
Rudy, you have to do what is right for you!! You can’t burn the candle from both ends! As it shortens the candles life. I’m glad to see you getting your own space to work as it will save you time, from have to keep moving stuff around between work and YouTube. Most of your subs, understand that bills need to be paid and until the channel can support itself. So remember to make sometime for yourself as you are the head chef and dishwasher!! You will find the balance that works for you and the channel! Can’t wait to see some of the future projects to come and see some come to the next stage!! Keep up the great work your doing!! God bless, from Northeastern Ontario Canada
Congrats on the new shop and what counts is that You are happy and excited.. Wishing you the best of luck in your new projects.i will be waiting for your new videos when you get some out.. Take great care Rudy..from Quebec Canada.
Of the 3 I'm most excited for the MJ
Pure Awesomeness , can't wait for the next video 😀
Congrats on the new shop, don’t worry. Things takes sometimes more time as you expect. Looking forward to see more of your fabulous fabrications 😎
I miss your videos and stuff but I also understand the burning out
I was genuinely worried when you went MIA for the last little while. I am glad to hear you are still going to produce videos and want to offer my congratulations and wish you the best on your new adventures. I am looking forward to many more hours of entertaining and informative content. Oh, and nicely done on Holly's fuel cell cage/basket ( what the heck do you call one of those? ). If I hadn't watched the video where you delivered it, I would have guessed it was done by one of the bigger outfits, like Barnes or TMR. Your stuff is amazing.
Never apologise for working hard! We understand. I will watch when ever you send out the videos! thanks for the hard work!
As soon  as I seen the building, I knew you were moving! Glad to see you back, been waitting for a new video since the Comanche... miss you on Matt's offroad, but glad to see your keeping up with the algorithm!! As the kids call it these days....
This is awesome! Film some of the shop development that's interesting too. Doesn't have to be super well produced and edited, just get it out there, I personally wanna see it.
While you're making sammichez, can I get a PB&J???
Life takes priority. We love the videos but it doesn't feel right when it negatively affects your life. Take care of you.
Great stuff you got going on Rudy.  You have to be skilled, knowledgeable, very well respected and genuine in order to have these new things which is awesome going on for you.  I’ve watched your Dads show long enough to see your personal growths thru the years and to see you become successful and have a blast doing it is cool to see.  Can’t wait for upcoming posts & best of luck!
COMANCHE!
Please don’t burn yourself out. Produce what you can. The loyalty of the subscribers will wait for any video you put out. Congrats on the new shop look forward to how you set it up. Thanks for doing what you do. :)
Congrats on the new shop!!! Looking forward the Colin's chassis swap.
Rudy, you are currently cutting your teeth on your road to your destination.   You DO have people following you and you WILL make it.  Keep trucking brother and we will be with you the whole way.
Good luck with your adventure through life
Rudy you do not need to justify yourself to us,  we are privileged to see parts of your life, we are here no matter what or how long this journey takes. Personally I xantcwait to see Colins truck build, thinking that's gonna be special.  Love wishes prayers to all from Truro Cornwall UK
Awesome new shop buddy!!! You will definitely love using it and being able to put your stuff in it and out of the weather!! It doesn’t look as if it has been used for a while??? If so you should see if you could buy it?? It’s definitely nice having a big shop to be able to work in when the weather is bad out side!!! Well I look forward to seeing more videos of yours and remember keep up all the hard work buddy!!!
you want to know what to do with that great space.......build reproductions of chines' junk's (boats)
I was wondering where you've been. This is exciting news. I can't wait for more videos. 👍
I imagine the most of us will be here watching when you get the sandwich cut.
Welcome back Rudy
Great to see you back!!!!
oh your just messing w us a bit ill try harder to stay tuned good luck in your new environment!
Oh.
Just like all the commentors, I will be watching when you have time to post.  You have serious skills and are young and energetic enough to make it all work out.
Welcome back we missed you. Glad for you!!
Rudy we all have to remember life is just life. You are still young man just do what you enjoy. Example- I just went through a series of treatments at Cleveland Clinic. In talking to my nurse I complemented her on the positive vibe she carries as that helps the patient to thrive. Her response was exactly the feeling I suspect you are looking for at this time in your life. She said in short “I love my job now. And when you love your job it is hard not to be happy.” wise words! You seem like a nice guy from what the videos reveal. Not like you are lazy right? A lazy person has no projects. Ill remain subbed to your channel and what whenever and whatever you post. Just learn to give yourself a break as self criticism kills creativity. You are a good dude
Way to go good for you and the channel looking forward to more videos and the new things to come and like to see how you lower that chevy I got a 1997 GMC two wheel that would be a good protect for me and my son its my old work truck that needs a new look.
Glad your back shop is super awesome congratulations
You are doing great and looking forward to your new venture.
my interest is first Comanche, 2nd the old Chevy, 3rd the Rudicon
Finish rudicon first, I love the C10 but the rudicon is so much closer
It's great to see you back and nice work on the fuel cage for Nessie. Favorite build is definitely the Rudicon, that pipe work on the cage is next level. Honestly though anything one off that goes from a vision to a reality through great fab work is always good entertainment
👍👍👍👍👍, Sounds like you are going to have a sweet setup for your projects .......... can't wait !!!!
Oh good I know it's hard lots totally get it👍good luck 👍 nice place
The most important thing to remember is, "To have fun in whatever projects you choose to invest your time in"! When it's not enjoyable anymore, just find something else that is. Will be here waiting for whatever project/adventure you wish to share with us! Thank You😊
Congratulations on your new shop Rudy.We understand it's gonna take time to get everything going but we know it will be worth the wait.👍👍
Hope you're not going to quit your day job and get sucked into the world of "internet influencer". Let your craft do the talking.
Boss move
CONGRATULATIONS! You just need a Tucker or Michelle clone!
Would like to see how the C10 will be finished. Good job.
Step one : finish the Rudicon
I still want to see the comanchee take on the same trails with the new lift and tires but in 2wd.
Congrats on the adventure. One video a week would be cool. Updates in Instagram should be easier than a sandwich. lol.  Looking forward to more build content.
finish the c10 rudy
Sometimes you gotta take a step back to take steps forward. Looking forward to whats next!
bro do not burn yourself out for us. burn yourself out for your dreams.
I was wondering about you this morning. I ended up hoping that you would be just too busy! Nice. Quality not quantity, beautiful view!
enjoyed all your vids feel bad for not being more supportive best wishes to you and yours Rudy!
Thousands of YouTubers have the same decision to make.  Some of them think it is worth their time and others don't.  Guess which ones are successful YouTubers with large incomes and which are not.  It is your choice and commitment to make.
Excited to see more ! congradulations
No worries dude take your time on the vids.  I want to fly my drone at your shop and dive those cliffs in the background.
It sounds like you need some buddies to help!
I wanna hear more about this sandwich build.
Youtube is more demanding than most people think. I have been growing my channel for a little over 2 years now and I do it all. Build the project, record it and edit it. This turns a 2 hour project into a 12 hour project most of the time. The commitment has to be real. Your video's are awsome but first comes the hard work. Then the fun, like breaking the jeep bringing us some awsome content.  Rock on Rudy.
Awesome!
I dislike clickbait titles.   Apologies aren't necessary.
👏👏👏👍👍👍
No worries, we get it! 😉   1. Get the Rudicon DUN. 2. Take care of family and get the old C10 modded. 3. Comanche can get picked at while you’re inevitably waiting for parts to the other projects.
Rudicon, Colin's truck, then comanche please.
Thanks for sharing! Stay safe!!
A really good sandwich takes time and effort... if I wanted it fast, it'd be one of those pre-made gas station sandwiches.
Get the XJ done man. !!  :)
now that's a space!!
Glad to see you back.  Post when you can. 😉
No problem, Rudy, just do what you can and what you need to do. I like to see builds most people can do themselves, on some kind of budget, not interested in building vehicles from scratch. Just can't relate to those. I have a 2001 Ford Ranger I would like to do some things to, just not sure which direction I want to go. How about some Ford builds? Not interested in anything that involves a LS swap. It's been done to death. Enjoy everything you've done so far, keep up the good work.
Awesome!!  New beginning...The world is your oyster, Rudy...Looking forward to your new content!
Family sticks together
You gotta do what you gotta do and we love what you do.
Go for it. It takes time to build up your own channel. I started watching you on Matt's channel and followed you here. I still watch that channel as well.  You post it and I'll watch it. I'll bet Matt misses you working at his place though. My 3 channels I never miss are Matt's Off Road, Fab Rats, Robbie Layton, and now you are the 4th. Great stuff.
C-10 fo sho! We’re still here Rudy!
I really like the new shop and the vibe it has. I’ve worked in many shops for the past 35 yrs and that is important! The vibe, I’m mean, not that I’m old!
It's called Rudys Adventure and Design, not Rudys weekly Videos. So, keep it focused on your adventures and designs. That's what we want to see - not your burning out :)
Please. Go back to morr. Much better platform for you
Hi rudy
No worries dude. your life is more important than youtube videos
Good progress Rudy...
C10
Where you been Rudy
Good luck to you I am pulling for you
good by dude,    you lost me with the product placement....same with Matts Im done being manipulated.....Rory is still real with no manufactured drama!
Buddy you have not worry about it . I will follow as long as you make videos!  I think most of your followers feel the same way! Keep up the great content and don’t stress about delays your followers will always be here!
Been missing the adventures! Most looking forward to the C10 but want to see the Rudicon finished.
You could easily fill that entire shop.  Metal working area, storage, parts, wash bay, painting, welding, etc......Maybe some day, you can buy the whole thing and do a shop`da`apartment\house?  LOL
Congratulations Rudy you got this
Congratulations!!
when you said "sandwich" , are we talking real sandwich or the one in How I meet your mother?
Good Luck
We Want More Comanche!!!
C10
I'm most curious about how the Rudicon will look finished since it is pretty well built but still 1/2 dun
Good to see your not giving up on what you truly want to do.
When your young and branching out kind of like a tree, the limbs get real small at the end. You find out what you can and cannot do before the branch breaks. Using the sandwich,  was good too. You have some good skills, but remember to have fun at it and include the people you want to be around. Define goal and no matter what it is, align your projects around it. I think a adventure can also be a part of a project. Make it a ride that you want to be on.
Hi dude, don’t worry about the pressure. ( open door I know)  Love the content. Get the jeeps the way you want/ can.   Love the view from the back of your shop. ( I live in the most boring piece of the globe, the Netherlands, flat muddy and boring)  And show ( if allowed) your self at your dads place once in a while ( family man myself 😃)
Been wondering where you've been Rudy, seen you on Hollie's channel. Understand its got to be hard...
Send it, Bro!
Making sandwiches is what the wife is for. 😉
Good luck Rudy
No apologies necessary.  Go Rudy go!
"i have a supprise".. Oh rudy got his own place.. 2 mins later they arrive at the new shop.. Yep could quessed it coming a mile away
So if you don't have the time to do your 9to5 at your boss's shop and do YouTube videos aswell.  How does having access to a big empty remote shop, with no equipment in it, somewhere else, resolve that situation?
Do what you can, when you can….
Consult with your accountant first, but if you finish the Rudicon and LEASE it to MORR, could be financially beneficial to BOTH parties.  Plus we'd get to see it featured in MORE recoveries!
The Banana will look great in that big building :)
Rubicon is more  favorite just keep your chin up   Videos can come after what's important
Really enjoy your videos. Even if they’re not frequent look forward to seeing them. Congratulations on the new shop. Maybe get Colins truck going.
We at Decal Paradise feel you my friend. We have been there, and no apologies needed. Comanche please!!!!!
No need to put out a bunch of content, we are here for you man. We enjoy all you do brother, keep up the great work!
congratulations on your new shop man.. hope all works out for you !!!!
I'm sorry, Rudy, but you don't need to apologize!
Glad to see you back bud ! I was starting to wonder what's going on hoping everything was ok with you and then I see you helping Holly on the race Jeep and I knew you had just been busy. I have a camper and a lot of mechanical skills from rebuilding any transmission to I've probably done 100 Subaru headgaskets ,2.5 liter obviously , in the last 10 years alone. Don't spread yourself to thin I'd be willing to move that way and offer some labor in trade for showing me some trails in that area to ride. Girlfriend and I are thinking of selling our home here in Vermont just to come down that way. Thanks to Matt's off-road recovery, fab rats, Rory and also you I love that state. Thanks for all you do. Were looking for a place in that area to start off with my 2011 Coleman 5th wheel camper with maybe a lot to rent or a few acres to start homesteading on.
look forward to seeing all your projects.
Quality is much better than quantity as far as I'm concerned, get that right and people will wait.
Finish the 'Rudicon' so you can have some fun and recharge.
I have missed you, but I know you have a job other than videos. I’m willing to take what you can produce with stressing yourself out.
Your adventure your rules. You do you. We'll be patient 👍🏻
You good, Rudy!
Continued Success!!  You are quite Awesome!!
It's good to see you back! Thanks for sharing what's going on! Sounds like fun times ahead!
Lol , anybody else remember Matt trying to cram 36 hours into a day .. but he got a good team around him .. I guess Rudy will do the same eventually , but don’t burn yourself out trying to keep churning out videos
I Like your videos, Would be Cool to see you Work on the Comanche 🙂, from Johnstown, PA 🇺🇲
When you first showed the garage and you mentioned you were sure what you were going to do with it all, the first thought that came to mind, if Matt needed more space, maybe he might be willing to RENT some of that space where he is needing some extra space. Just a thought.
awesome to see you back, you got this
Totally resonate with that one, Rudy.  My sandwiches take about 3-5 hours to make, then editing and storyline takes another 8-12 hours.  Just not worth it financially for me with my small channel so I can only view it as a fun hobby. A hobby that soaks up all my free time.
Do what you think is best. Me being selfish and a lot older would like to see you do everything thing you can to keep your day job employer going strong. You may have to go back again someday or get a friend or brother a place to work.
Just keep being you and don't worry about the footage!
Congratulations dude!!
Get Rudicon finished then do your brothers truck cause that's gonna be sweet! Then the Comanche. That thing is gonna be awsome too.
Sometimes life gets in the way of what you want to do but somehow it always works itself out. RAD is back on track and that's all that matters... Looking forward to your future projects Rudy 👍🙂👍
That c10 has a better rear suspension for bagging and anti wheel hop!
Meh, lo único bueno era Janelle.
Nothing good comes easy , head down and get it it done 🎉
Do what you do buddy!!  Love watching yawls videos!!  Wish I was closer. I would be more than glad to help!!
Was worried you had to stop YT and I'm glad your not. Dang that new shop is rad.
Latly I've been working nearly 150 hours past 2 weeks it gets old so I totally understand working a lot
Congrats on new shop I like all your builds…give us a videos when you are ready thank you for what you do to entertain us…
Nice teaser intro ; ). I was wondering if you hit a crossroad moment?  Your analogy was spot on, I cant imagine the time it takes to put together videos on top of your other responsibilities.  Glad to see you back, you're young enough to take chances and rebound if needed.  Also looking forward to some great content!  I am for the C10.  Cheers.
Wish you the best Rudy, you are the man !!
You make them, I'll watch them. However long it takes. Don't work too hard, have fun.
Glad to see you post again! Take all the time you need, we will be here ready to watch your progress.  I think you should finish the Rudicon as that's where this all started.
I love those desert 🏜 vistas 👍
I got a bologna cheese sandwich
Good luck with your new adventure can't wait to see what you have for us to see. I enjoy watching your videos and can't wait to see what's next.
Ill always be here even its just a video a month. Looking forward to seeing the rudicon finished
YEA YOUR BACK, was wondering what happen. Again YEA YOUR BACK...
all good. Life is life
You gotta finish the rudicon
Its ok Rudy, its this thing called "Life".... Hopefully we will see more of Jenelle and your cute little puppy dog ,who is probally  big o dog now, (the puppy you silly poops.)🤭
Good for you Rudy.
Rudy, fwiw here are the words of an old geezer who has found YouTube content to be more personally profitable than broadcast or cable TV.  The most enjoyable content for me is to be included in "your" life as you do things you genuinely enjoy.  In other words, "if it ain't fun, why do it?"  In reality I have grandkids your age.  But, even with that much of a gap between our ages, your content interests me because you seem to be:  a) very good at what you do b) very happy doing what you do c) willing to share your talents with those who need help d) and, very humble, even when things don't actually turn out the way you had originally envisioned.  Share what you can, as you can, and with the biggest smiles and genuine laughter that sweep you away in the moment.  You're growing.  Continue that with all the joy that success and achievement brings your way.
Commanche is my favourite. You still working full-time? Hope this works out better for you! Im not really interested in lowered stuff, but will watch it just to see the emgineering :)
Love Me some RAD Sandwiches!!
The best projects are never done. They are living transformations.
PPPFFFFFFF WHAT EVER....
Glad to see you back ! Don't worry about it because lots of us have worked two jobs for a few years so we can get ahead. We know it's not easy.
we appreciate the head's up....but you do not owe anyone an explanation ! it takes time to grow and expand. Only so many hours in a week and your building your base...we love the video's but most of us probably have zero idea the time and attention it take's to get the video's to us:)P so good luck looking forward to you future video's the bell is clicked so know when to drop by!
YouTube is such a time suck with so little reward.   LIke you said, filming vs making takes a lot out of you.   You’re starting your own thing, and then trying to film it too has to be a mess.   I hope you figure it out for what works for you, we’ll be around if you decide to do it with videos, cool, if not, that’s cool too.
Good luck Rudy!  Keep doing what we all know you love, wrenching and fabricating.  We'll be here when you want us.
Comanche build!
Don't worry about the sandwiches you will get someone LOL good help it's hard to find
Rudy you just have way to many pokers in the fire. Don't beat yourself up for not posting content every few days right now because you have it going on and getting everything dialed in right now.
Rudy you just have way to many pokers in the fire. Don't beat yourself up for not posting content every few days right now because you have it going on and getting everything dialed in right now.
The C10 for sure I am so into 2wd air ride trucks the other content is awesome also
Man I wish I lived closer to you. I have a professional filming and editing studio setup.. Osmo cams, GoPros, Drones, filming equipment and support gear, custom computers with rendering capabilities and vehicles to film [literally] anywhere. I'd totally be game to straight-up share with you and work with you, just for the opportunity to do something neat!
Welcome back hopefully we see the shop build
You.re doing good man.  You'll get your stride.
Looking forward to seeing progress on the C10 👍
Sorry Rudy. You were super cool with your dad on the recovery channel. As an independent it's like watching the grass grow.
Love the comanche, and yeah... we will watch when you upload!!
OMG Just quit eating sandwiches...
Keep making videos  I'm 61 years old and have been trying to make YouTube videos myself but haven't yet got it but I will keep trying  I'm just an old guy leaning new tricks
Fill the rolls, I thought it was a sandwich
Finish the Rudicon first
That underwear ad you made was genius and hilarious.
Be in Love and follow your passion and then the rest will follow $$$$
Was I the only one that thought about How I Met Your Mother when Rudy’s talked about the sandwich making? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeYgIwBRvGQ
How about a project for Janelle?
We are very patient about waiting on your content we love you we've been with you since Matt's offroad recovery so you have nothing to worry about plus I saw you at mischief maker and I saw what you did they're awesome job they're Rudy
😊👍🏼
From Quebec Canada ,  keep going , you still young . One day if I pass by I'll stop .
Bro, I’m here for every video! I don’t care when or how many come out per month, week or year. Every video you upload, I will be here waiting for it! So far my favorite is the Comanche. I don’t know anything about fabrication or welding but, now I have a welder and it’s because of you that I’m pushing myself to learn more and build my own stuff! I don’t have an off-road vehicle yet, but when I get one, all work will be done by my own two hands!! Thank you Rudy!
Keep it up looking forward to new videos
WOW!!! So much room for activities! Let's goooooo! Congrats Rudy!
Where you going to put the toilet in this place??
Great news Rudy... Glad to see you step in a big way... Both buildings and videos.  Congrats
Post when you can Rudy….we’ll wait!
We enjoy your videos. No stress tho'. 👍
Man, you're doing great. Keep on doing what you can. BTW the Comanche is my favorite.
Rudy it's called life. It's not perfect
I miss your videos but don’t worry about the frequency of them. I’ll watch them as they come out.
Rudy I am glad you are back I always enjoy your videos. I definitely like the new shop. My favorite build has to be the Rudicon without a doubt. When I get a chance to meet you in person I would love to go for a ride in the Rudicon.
Now I want a sandwich! Thank you
Do your thing Rudy. We’re here to watch and enjoy whenever you get something out. I have another channel I watch that only post like a 15 min video every 4 months. I’m still subscribed. Life gets busy man, post when you can.
Good to see you back, Rudy! Watching all the way from South Africa!
Congrats on the new shop can’t wait to see what new projects are coming so far the rudacon has been my favorite build but they all have been great don’t worry about getting burnt out it happens to everyone glad you’re back
Just keep doing what ur doing 😁 . Ohh and finish the project that's the closest to being done and get it off ur back and free up a bit of head space for the next one
The main thing is take care of yourself, do what you can we will be waiting.
Is the new place out near Hanksville?  Kinda looks like it.
Excellent, thanks for the update on what's happening Rudy
Always stoked to see what you got going on  Don’t burn yourself out buddy we’ll be here
That shop has a cool vibe! I think your creativity is going to thrive here! The way a place makes you feel can have an impact on the things you create and build! Thanks for taking us along for the ride! 👍
God bless you all 🙏🏻 ❤ I'm proud of you 👏 🥰
The "Rudicon" ought to be 'ala Banana/Morrvair' Quality.  Can you do that first ?  Robby can paint it ... maybe ??? 😉🙃
Glad that you are back and am looking forward to the content of being at your new shop will bring. 👍
Hell yeah Rudy nice new building!
Congrats on the new shop guys.  Looking forward to the future.   As a small channel youtuber I often times get tired of filming the making of sandwiches myself.   I enjoy my automotive hobby and a lot of times I think I'd rather just make the damn sandwich and then eat it and enjoy it.
You do you and then what you do you can share with us family first Friends second videos third we can wait and that's all I got to say about that
Good luck! Awesome you're doing what you love!
You’re doin it man! Keep workin hard you got this. I wish I filmed the process of my jeep, but I don’t wanna deal with all that mess. Will you be going to koh next year?
This video inspired me to go make a sandwich!
I'd like to see your brother's old Chevy built first but I'm okay with whichever one you go with!!! LOL yes, I do have commitment issues...I think... but I don't know!!!!
Way to go Rudy! The Comanche is my favorite build so far.
So are you considering taking in viewer projects?
Rudy like the name says its your adventure and where all along it with you So do it your way and we will be along for the ride you don't got set a show date just post them as you got the time & if you want put 2-3 vids as one it's great So don't worry we will share each one with all our followers and help you grow larger !
Good for you.  Glad you can move forward.
Get off his dick. This is YouTube. He is not our family or friends. We will survive without a YouTube video.
Life comes first. Upload when you can. Your a one man show that has other things going on.  Glad to see your progressing to your own space.
Bravo ,👏👍👌
Congrats on your new office..
Like father like son. I remember he got burned out with making videos early on, so don't stress it. It will all come together. And some of us did see you on Hollie's channel. BTW, nice gas tank.
No apology needed. Being a responsible adult comes with complicated choices at times. Glad to see all is well and you have plenty of good projects still on your plate. We’ll all be here for your next video!
Dont burn urself out, theyll always be more work to do 👍 congrats on new shop space 🤙
Life always comes first.  Just glad all is well with you.
Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life
Can't wait for the new content
Comanche
Awesome announcements.
The ck is pretty cool project
Ok sorry. That was a tactless remark. 😕
Congratulations On the new shop
Use the community page to keep us updated that doesn't take a 100th of the time & still keep your channels subscribers in the loop. Not a big deal. Keep yourself mentally ok too buddy thats the most important part 👍. Thanks for the update Rudy.
Awesome cant wait to see what is to come
Finish half done:)
Go go Rudy
Congratulations.
💯🤔 Rudy you just be you and take care of yourself and your old lady. Bottom line take care of your responsibilities and make yourself HAPPY.👊🏼🖖🏼
Dude, being a full time dad, with full time job and trying to work on stuff, it's hard. So I can relate. Always love your content.
I don't need fancy sandwiches. Give me bread, mayo and bologna and I'm happy. Looking forward to the new shop 👍
We miss you! Don't worry about the frequency at which you post. We will watch when you do!
I’ll move over there and be your prep cook lol
It is sure good to see you again, been missing you!
NO, NO, NO, NO this is not your last video.  Well I like your videos so I hope it's not your last video anyway.
Where is your girl friend? Didn’t she help?
💯🤔 I put you out as missing an action🤣 good to see you're still alive and kicking hope things are going well Albuquerque New Mexico love. Plan a visit I'll hook you up
No prob.  Upload when you can!  Thanks!
YAY!!!!
I’ve never clicked so fast … 1. Rudicon 2. C10  3. Comanche
🤙🏻🇨🇦👍🏻.  RAD. Is back.  Baby.
