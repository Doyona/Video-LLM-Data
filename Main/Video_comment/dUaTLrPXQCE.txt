It’s so weird that travelling sorta makes you sick. Like on a long flight or a grueling journey and you get a sorta travel cold, like not motion sickness but like a flu sorta thing just from travelling. Can hear in your voice a sorta travel cold after a grueling 14 hour boat ride across the Irish Sea. A couple hours across the channel is about my limit for any of the waters surrounding our “island home”*   *pointless (haha, get it? Because it’s poi… & it’s also… whatever f you man, it was gonna be gloriously hilarious) internet points to be awarded to anyone who gets the reference*.  * 1 like will be awarded to the 1st person to figure out the obvious reference, an “emoji” or if you’re old like me, an “emoticon” may also be included. Likes may also be awarded to any other commenters* at the sole discretion of myself, the owner and sole user of this YouTube account, an account created when I was like 14 with a typo in the name.   *Provided anyone even sees this, and/or comments, which they won’t; In which case, fuck you for not reading my amazing comment. 😊
You should’ve gone to cork
ALLAHUAKBAR
If it’s not raining in Ireland your in whales
the w man Ryan trahan gotta give the homie some advice bro

I HATE this video, I was eating while watching it and he gave a clip of him throwing up in the sea, I have emetophobia which basically means fear of throwing up or watching someone do it and I was awfully disgusted, my heart was pounding seeing him do it, and as I told you before I was eating also...now i dont wanna eat either watch this video anymore...thanks alot Airrack
Spanish please 😢
I love rain
I want to see Geowizard analyze this line
Geowizard anyone
This reminds me of Ryan's penny series
Respects to Airrack for starting with Ireland!
Airrack is so famous that news people actually advertised his clothes 🙏🙏
THIS IS CRAZY!!!

Day one🎉

I’m Irish and bean’s could totally pull it of
The streets in Dublin were closed due to the Dublin riots where children were stabbed
earth is round so straight line in aflat map will have a curveture so they are basically following a curve
so its basically the best vlogmas everrr

The first island you was Irelands eye
Can you cross norway in a straight line
The harbour you went  to is howth
It was so busy beacause who where there during the rugby world cup
Im irish
Whys ur videos so quiet, the ad comes on and scares tf outta me
Mr. Bean already did that.
You're racist
the indian guy looks like the golden gully as well as tariq from mr beast at the same time lol
To everyone reading become a born again Christian so you can have eternal life ( a good eternal life in heaven after you die) The bible says whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved ( made righteous and forgiven ) God made me a true Christian and He can save you too, even from eternal (hell) so please just repent and pray this prayer Jesus save me please in amen.
Straight Line  |
Doha is brand ambassador of @kellywakasa clothing brand he always promote 😂
ponganlo en español
Not quite GeoWizard level with the whole straight line thing, but still love to see it
As someone who has edited before, I don’t honestly think they are editing a new video every single day. It takes me 12 hours to make a 10 minute video sometimes. No way they are doing that in a day with this level of detail
Day 1 of getting Airrack to like my comment
Here since day 1
Not just a Guinness in Ireland that was a Guinness in the temple bar!
Fidas????????????!!!!!!
Im just on the edge of northern ireland so id say that you got within 50 miles of me, love going down to dublin, its better then belfast up here.
I'll be commenting on your videos for 30 days straight so you come to Africa 🎉 #Day1
30
the fact that they instinctively found the biggest tourist trap bar in dublin is spectacular
ty airriak
Arrick if you fail the challenge....im going to cover myself in honey, dump feathers on me, and stay outside all day and humiliate myself if you fail.
I’m from illand
No way you went to howth you should’ve gone to irelands eye

3:00 I went on a vacation to Ireland and I stopped by here( I’m too young to drink but it was a nice place to hang out)
For anyone who is interested Geowizard has similar videos where he will hike across countries in a perfectly straight line (with a GPS). He has to trespass on land and climb up mountains and kayak over lakes. Everyone should definitely check it out
Beans is so real for wanting to find love on the line 😂❤
I'm l Irish

Yes airrack is doing the most impossible challenge yet, but at the same time during the whole December he’s making me laugh and smile!!!! 😤🗣️
welcome to Ireland.

Thanks for saying nice stuff about Ireland because I’m Irish and people barely knew Ireland existed

There is Henry Belcaster
Also you should visit Wexford its an amazing place
Nice vid sending love from Ireland, ❤❤
Honestly beans looks like my dad..
a moment of silence for Airrack's editors. My heart goes out to you this month. 🙏
this idea is incredible!!! Its like a calender where you can open a door for every day!! So Good!!!!!!❤❤

Don't Translate it 😨 หลังจากนั้นไม่กี่ชั่วโมง หัวใจของคุณจะหยุดเต้น วิธีเดียวที่จะป้องกันสิ่งนี้ได้คือสมัครรับข้อมูลบน chanel ของฉัน ........
Irish Youtuber here, cool to see this start off in Ireland. Although the Temple Bar is a mediocre Guinness compared to what the City has to offer.
I have sailed in Howth before that’s where he was
this is impossible on a flat earth. he would’ve had to go in a circle. now ik what he means by around the earth
Do England, and make sure you go through Preston
Love Airrack but as a European I would love to see a video where Germany and Italy aren't considered the most Eastern countries in Europe. At most, it's half a continent in a straight line. The Balkans would have been so much more interesting to cross! 🍻
Hello airrack please go to Slovakia it's in Europe it's beside hungary
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤day 1 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🎉
no one from your dating videos are still together 😂😂 emotional damage
Imma going to be commenting on every Airrack video for the next 30 days before his channel gets deleted (we'll miss him) day 1
The fact that you more than likely walked right past my office in Dublin while I was working actually kills me 😭😭😭
Bro is literally travelling the grand line to find the one piece
Airrack, if you Fail i Really wanna make a cooking show with u  and Airrack dont fail, but i still really wanna do a cooking show with u :)
call me a meat muncher but this is why youre the goat eric
I wish you has to cross my country. It would be both scary, BEAUTIFUL sceneries and dangerous. Because of the roads through the mountains.
The only thing that we irish people hate more than people thinking we are leprechauns is Americans claiming they are Irish. Mark was pissed at beans for saying that.
What happened to max? Just curiosity..🧐
i like your video very much
Literally the penny challange
Uk baby
Italy
Real ones Stan Dohaa

The leprechaun joke was personal
I Will Delete your channel
I am actually crying right now that I didn’t get to meet you 😢
Airracks amazing video but you zoom in to much onto you and your friends faces in future dont zoom in to much
Yeah that “parade” was the aftermath of a bunch of racists rioting to get foreigners out of the country 💀
Try going round a country
bro forgot about iceland
This is about to rock the internet
Yo my name is Ireland
Give @geowizard some credit

If he’s traveling around the world, does that mean that he has to go to North Korea?
Why did you not tell me you're going to ireland
I’m dead 4:26

the way mark just went like you expect to get love on this small island and not like in the whole world where you didnt
There’s no way I’m believing he’s making these videos currently. They need to show the date in every video.
4:34 - Bro was floating there like the man antagonist.
why’d i watch “land ho, we’re in whales” 4 times to critique each one of their dabs 🤣🤣 minute 9:20
So where’s his next video?
6:45 can someone tell me what place that is?
Hes kinda trying to be like Ryan Trahan
1:50 what are you talking about. that is normal!
day 1 epic
Last year war Ryan Trahan This year Airrack 😭💖
I hope airrack completes this challenge because I love watching his videos.

It would hit much differently if Ryan Trahan was here..

Rip his editor
Airrack’s quality of videos have gotten so much better

All lives are precious so in any situation the gospel is needed: "For God so loved the world that He gave his only Son that whosoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16) God is just so because we broke his moral law by doing wrong against Him, ourselves and others, His punishment for sin is the death penalty. However He is also merciful which is why He gave Himself in human form (Jesus) to die for us, and take away our sins if we repent and believe in Him. If we do, our debt or bail is paid and we can go free. God is also merciful for those who have never heard the gospel and will judge them by their conscience, actions and belief in Him from evidence of creation.

Can't wait for the day when I wake up and notice that Airrack is missing from my subscription box and realizing the thing happening.      I mean I don't want it to happen, but I just can't wait for that day.
Is the direction so he has one day more or less?
Credit to @Geowizard for doing this idea first
Let me know when in Switzerland I'll help you cross the swiss Alps on skis
How difficult can this be? Just catch airplanes & hire Uber to drive you in straight line when camera is off. Easy Pizzy! 😆
Bro you must visit Kerala
W Airrack
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you’ll ever hear. All of us, without exception, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). As a result, that means that as sinners, we will all get what we rightly deserve: eternal punishment, which is called the second death. But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23), all while justice is done. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross, and He was then buried and rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Regardless of who you are or what you may have done, if you believe with your heart the gospel ( ^^ which I just mentioned above) and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9,10). Salvation is simple and free. It’s not a 12 step program, and don’t think, as many do, that you just have to be a “good person” or do good works to go to heaven. Salvation is based on what Jesus did, not what you do (Ephesians 2:8,9). Believe in Christ, and you will be saved. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him.” John 3:16,17

Why did he call it crossing Europe, he crossed less than half of it
It literally seems you're already off the line as soon as you get in the vehicle. There's no way that whole road is on your line.

This is probably the best challenge you ever did. Daily content for a whole month.
You got this
You should travel the planet in a straight line 👍
GO MEET WITH THE SIDEMEN IN THE UK
According to my calculations, technically he never went in a straight line, during the first few seconds where he is standing near the water, he moves over to the right to climb up the hill, also the roads he is using are curved, and there for he failed since the beginning.  Lmao.. keep up the good content
Homie crossed a continent in 9 minutes 😂😂😂😂😂
Roblox boy
I love Ireland
camera man never gets motion sick😭 camera man is always invincible
I am a time traveler he indeed dose succeed.
Airrack please  not fail we love your contents 😢

You can do it
In this series I am rooting for beans to find love
Arrack my birthday is on December 31st
UMmmmmmmm, its not a parade in Dublin, it was riots and looting from a bunch of crazy people to rebel against the government after 3 young children were attacked outside of a school. That's to simplify it
Who tf decided to make a straight path right through europe
GREECE OR CYPROS ?? i think one of them is the other edge but I forgot you are american _geography....

I'm waiting for u in Serbia...
I liked my own comment

The fact that his channel is still online means the challenge succeeded. They clearly didn't do this very recently or at this moment 'cause otherwise they wouldn't be wearing shorts in the video.
Why are the view moving backwards???

last day of og fortnite 💔
I mean he never said he couldn’t make a new channel, so what’s stopping him from making a new one?
You are the goat
I remember the first time I watched Erik's video, where he humorously 'imprisoned' David Dobrik and showcased his ability to entertain people. Now, he has become a huge sensation, taking on one of the most challenging feats in his career by creating top-notch non-vlog videos for 30 days straight. I still have some doubts, but good luck, man!
