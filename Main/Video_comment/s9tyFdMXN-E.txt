🥹🕷️⚰️❤️
Just at his parents backyard
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE IS THE BEST COMFORT MOVIE HANDS DOWN
i just finished watching inside bo burnham for the third time and u just mentioned it right off the bat😭
Nobody: Uzi:
When life is a mess and you're feeling down , who can you count on ? Garrett Watts!! ❤❤❤
Now we got the BEAR witch project HAHAHA
41° isn't cold...
So it’s 2025 and I don’t understand how I missed all these videos …….
Its so weird to watch him google where he can find nature when I can walk less than 5 minutes down the road and be in the bush in suburban australia.
My comfort movie is Juno :) Love ya G <3
so sad that these woods might burn rn in 2025 o.o
Please be careful Garrett. The fact that you very nearly died multiple times and in various ways during this video (not to mention a lot of other videos on your channel) is genuinley concerning. PLEASE take care of yourself ❤
Dear past Garrett I am reporting from November 2024 and we don't know how the blade reboot is either because a man killing vampires is too complicated of a concept to adapt apparently. We did get a Wesley Snipes cameo so there is that.
I wish you would sing shiny teeth
Algorithms brought me here.  Have to admit. You seem crazy. I am crazy as well. Which is a good thing to my crazy mind.  Also, I am not a Professional just working in that field. But you seem somehow ADHD, manic to me.  Best combination.  Take care and good job. Will definitely subscribe!
My comfort movie is Shrek 💚
I've never seen Garrett with this much facial hair lol
My comfort movie is The Corpse Bride! Also Psycho and The Exorcist
That time of year, will we get a thawed out Garrett this year complete with the caveman beard again?
can you imagine someone in 100 years finds that lil coffin😂
Yeah, nature was cancelled in like 1930. I'm sorry that his spider died. Yo, fr what people need to keep an eye out for in the San Gabriel are rabid mountain lions.
This is a comfort video for me❤
Garette, I gotta know. Was that video reel of the real spider buddy or was it a paid actor for the cinematic recreation?
Nah dude this guy is crazy
Aghhhhhh ! Something bit my ass ! Had me rolling! 😂
Garrett you are hilarious 😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
My comfort movie is Harold and Maude. 🥰
Your videos are my comfort show/movie! They’re my absolute fav!! Vibes with my ADHD brain 🧠 I know this is an older video but just thought I’d answer. My favorite comfort movie would be anything Adam Sandler and or Harry Potter 🪄
↪️ What happens when Andrew leaves Garrett to his devices. Oh God send him in quick, this could escalate! 💀
''people cant say mean things about you if you say them first'' they can and will, and now you have two people bullying you for no reason. love urself, buddy

my comfort movies are  1. eternal sunshine of the spotless mind  2. tangled  3. mamma mia 4. mamma mia here we go again  5. psych (except the show, not the movie)
as someone agnostic, i love hearing my fav creators saying that they’re also agnostic 😭
I liked his beard
My comfort movie is Clueless ✌️
Iv just found your channel,  you chaotic energy has me hooked, 😂
My movies would be 50 shades of gray * kidding * it has to be the help. Find it funny when she said " eat my sh*t" lol she actually did 😂  overall it would be the movie I would watch alot. Not as good as the book but yea.
Waittt, is no one going to talk about how amazing Garrett’s vocals were?👀
thank you for bringing me so much happiness and laughter through your video!
The little tea cup in the corner when he said get out
Howls moving castle

Your videos always bring me joy and your story compelled me to share that little story with you, Garrett!

holy shit 2021 was a wild time
My dad’s equipment was tampered with, come to find out people had stolen parts off of his loader and skidder. Based on the way they had left the scene, my dad believes they did it for drugs. The uprising catalytic converter thefts is probably due to fall of capitalism. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy, I am an empath and I feel for you during this time, much love Garrett❤️
My movie is Constantine
Awwr!  I would have preferred to hear you flamboyantly singing Moulin Rouge!
I LOVE THIS MAN SOOOOOOOO MUCH 😂
I would be terrified of your tent more then anything. I have a phobia of dinos lol
I haven't watched the whole video yet but I feel like your not going to make it 2 nights. Only because I saw you try to stay in the abandoned camper your family owns and couldn't lol. I wouldn't be able to either so dont feel bad lol
2:34 this is all part of it has me cracking up
Drive to Banff alberta
But... I kinda like the grown out look 🤩
I don't think Garrett gets enough credit for his cinematography skills. They are incredible. The way he showed his shadow digging the grave was so cinematic! And yes I am rewatching all of his videos
My favorite comfort movie is stand by me or the goonies.
I just picture Garrett throwing his skeleton at the bear to scare it away
30 minute Taco Bell ad
14:40 this is the first time I’ve ever heard Garrett swear and i love it it’s too funny

My comfort movie is Jaws. I know that sound weird but it's the whole thing, the small town and all the excellent characters. Plus sharks are cool.
You are the personification of ADHD.
Frozen
Garrett sometimes I'm terrified for your safety 😅I'm glad this was a year ago and that you lived lol. Also spirited Away is a amazing movie.

We all feel same. Your mental enough to do it 😂
I hate those brooms
Why did I actually think a tree fell on u it scared me and then I died laughing 💀😂😂😂😂
When you yelled “get lost bat!” I thought you said “get lost fat!” For a sec and it made me lose it
I just wanted to say I’m glad you made it safely and thanks for being my pretend friend! Lol had a rough day and it was fun to rewatch some of your older videos and not feel so alone!
The Princess Diaries, or Ella enchanted, or The Cat Returns. Really anything Anne Hathaway
Lumberjack gay in the woods my favorite film 😂
Garrett is so handsome ♡ and silly . Gotta love him ❤😂
Obnoxious. I left after 10 seconds.
Garrett *doesn’t want to have to fight a bear* also Garrett *leaves trail of cookies leading right to him* 😂 ily garebare
Nightmare before Christmas
25:46 You look like Kronk with his little tent in The Emperor's New Groove.
18:32 Did... Did you call the authorities or highway patrol? Best practice of if you're not sure, assume it's possibly human remains and let them know.18:43 OH, THANK GOODNESS.

We all still waiting for blade

Hi Garrett!!! I was wondering if you had a PO box?? I'm finishing up writing my novel, and you were a huge inspiration for me to continue what I'm doing and get through it, so I'd like to send you a copy once it's finished. It's a fantasy mystery novel that takes place in an academy! I think you'd like it!!  Let me know!!! I love your content!! You're my inspiration <3
The way he did t bring any blankets 😭😭
“Are lobsters immortal”

The way he convinced himself to leave via song.
My comfort movie is The Silent Voice ❤😊
bit late with the awnser but little miss sunshine is my comfort movie :)
My comfort movie is probably the first hobbit movie. At some point it was just on a loop for several days. Sometimes I played the second one too, the third one wasn't really doing it for me.
I can't believe there's a whole ass Garrett video I've never watched before??? FROM A YEAR AGO? What on earth was I doing that could possibly keep me from discovering this?
My comfort movies are Porco Rosso , Pride and Prejudice, and Charlie’s Angels
I think you guys should do a ghost investigation with Patti Negri! I think it would be really cool!
I love youuuuu! Why are you like scooby and shaggy in one person? 😅💗
Diary of the wimpy kid rodrick rules
my comfort movie is deffo Trainspotting 2 or any of the 3 original starwars trilogies (probaly not ROTS tho just bcus the scene with anakin and obiwan fighting makes me SOB violently)
well i'm very glad you didn't die in the woods that would not have been ideal
I honestly feel like that would be me to a certain extent if I go camping. But also just cause mayhem and probably appear in the news because of a fire.
My comfort movie is book of life cause it was the best movie ever created ‼️‼️‼️
i love the internet segments
my freind i have ibs
“Are lobsters immortal”🤣🤣
He looks nice with a beard
When I feel at my lowest you really do always make me laugh. Thank you Garrett🖤
I've had a horrible past week and haven't felt happy until I saw this video. I appreciate you.

bro please i grew up in a holler
My comfort movie is Poltergeist 👻 It makes me so happy 😊
Y does your music sound like Don’t stop or We’ll die
Yep that breakdown is relatable.
That’s happening down here in Hawaii. A lot of people is cutting people’s converters off of trucks.
Garret playing simple piano keys with two hands crossing other each other is the most wholesome thing I’ve ever seen.
My comfort movie is Matilda! I’ve always related to her in a way.
You are so beautiful.
My comfort movie I think is The Princess Switch. Something about it reminds me a lot of my family? Along with the giddy feeling of Christmas (that I just haven't been feeling recently).
Can you imagine coming across him in the woods 🤣🤣
My comfort movie is "The Devil Wears Prada" I used to watch it with my mom a lot as a kid :))
Hey Garrett, I just wanted to let you know how big of a comfort youve become for this adult with autism. I've been going through a lot this last like.. year lol and your videos became something very comforting for me when Im not feeling great. I like to think of us as friends through the screen and youve helped me through some hard times. I really hope you have a wonderful day and I cant wait for more videos to watch on repeat.
Would pay real human money to buy that Taco Bell track on ITunes
You should watch Survivor man
U should move out of LA. Ur better then that
I feel like Garrett is just the sweetheart of youtube
I laughed out loud so many times, 😂 thank you, I needed this ❤.
Casper. Hands down. Also it's officailly my birthday today and I'm on a Garrett Watts spooky binge lol.
I do enjoy how Garret is explaining the different stages of what "mental burnout" is via their life experiences.
My comfort movie is the live action TMNT movie idk why tho
RIP window spider 🕷️🕸️
Also my comfort movie is singin’ in the rain🙃
I would love to just hang out w Garrett for a day🙃I feel like it would be so much fun but also like he seems like someone that would make you feel uplifted.
4:56 - Nice ref! Stuffies/Bears/WarmBuddies are good for people with ADHD. I find it helps me sleep 😌 💤  Also I was scheduling in to work on a SkillShare course on Premiere Pro.
Imma tell my kids this is Bo Burnham
Me before the video even starts: "Dang Garrett. Love this ruggedly handsome look!"  Garrett in less than 2 minutes: "I know I look terrible! Stop dwelling on it"  Um... what? Ha!
when he pulled the butter knife out of the cookies i was actually shocked
Bearcrow. 🐻
Ah why am I so late to this video?! This has been a dream of Mike recently (haven't watched it yet but I'm so excited)
LMAO just hitting north 5 to find green? oooh boy, see you in 5hrs
I am so happy my buddy Christadoodles got me hooked on you. your laugh is infectious and your engery makes me feel more comfortable about my own energy. ^_^ Keep up the great work!
If I lived in a state with a Governor like yours I would leave to. So at least you have a good reason.
Try getaway cabins
I called myself agnostic for awhile and I’m surprised that I got more hate for that than when I called myself an edgiest  Edit: athiest* why the fuck “Edgiest”
I don't know about that bear scarecrow... especially if you encounter some furries in the woods or a frisky bear.
The best movies are low budget horror movies 🎬
Spooooky
You are wild 👻👻👻👻in the woods
Garrett, you are the only person who noticed your hair, just call yourself a magician, a practitioner high magick Magick with a k as your spirituality, basically you make things happen
Garrett looking like a fucking wild dog for 30 minutes straight
I wish I knew Garrett in person 😭
5 minutes in: I’m currently going through something similar to this (my brain desperately trying to convince me to become feral and run away into the forest never to return again) and it’s fun to get this glimpse into my possible future, lmao.
Get on some stimulants Garrett!! 😂 (for ADHD)
I may be watching this a year later but still relevant mah man! Also you are giving the Grizzly Adams vibe and I am 100% here for that shite!!! 💜🥰💯 ALSO was not disappointed whatsoever with how this ended! 🤤🤤🤤
"I don't know where is nature" me too, Garrett.
Comfort movies: harry potter series
my comfort movie is any descendants movie its actually embarrassing
Garrett, love this video, so much fun!  My comfort movie is The Nightmare before Christmas, I love the music!  Love ya!
I’m watching him pack up the car, and I was thinking what if the cops pulled him over on his way to the woods and take ONE LOOK at the cargo in the back and be like 🧐🫠
Yup.  The crazy neighbour in Huntington Beach (Orange County, just south of LA county) got their cat converter stolen, too, and took nearly a YEAR for their insurance to pay out for them to get it fixed.
oh my god my comfort movie is the conjuring, could watch it forever
Wait! Garrett can sing??? His hot level has gone through the roof!
My comfort movie is Dog Soldiers
Most of the movies I like are comfort movies, but one of my favourites is 'Parental Guidance' from 2012. I used to watch it every time I went to my grandparents house when I was younger, so it's very nostalgic and it makes me so happy. 🥰
My comfort movie is Howl’s Moving Castle!
Garret propping up his phone in the medicine cabinet to watch cowboy beebop is me trying to prop up my phone in the sink to binge watch One Piece as well
Watch :  Kiki's delivery service
Am I the only one who thinks he still looks good? I don’t know why he has such low confidence but I think he looks very handsome and cute.
I would of grabbed the bones of the side of the road and make another skeleton friend
my comfort movie is Constantine 2005
50 First Dates is one of my top 3 repeat comfort movies. The other two are Clue and Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers. I cannot legally rank them in order so they all tie for 1st :)
My comfort movies 🎬   are anything with zombies
Garrett...dude...how are you not dead? Or at the very least not loaded with tetanus?           Also, my current favorite comfort movies is Deadpool. It has some of everything in all the ways I need it. Others have been Shaun of the Dead, Pirates of the Caribbean, Kung Pow: Enter the Fist, The Goonies, and The Addams Family.
what the actual hell
My comfort movie is jurassic park and also all the movies that came after that
The tree 😭😭😭
Omg i can't wait for the blade reboot yes
Rose red, Lord rings,Harry Potter,black Butler :)
24:55 wtf was that-
My comfort movie is The Covenant, one of the most aggressively mediocre movies of all time that I love with all my heart  Also, glad you made it home safe!!! (.... a year ago)
my comfort movie is probably Howl's Moving Castle !
this is so sterssful but entertaining to watch lmaoooo. Only Garrett's videos give me this special blend of stress and humor.
my comfort movie(s) have to be thor ragnorok or batman begins :D
Garrett is just adorable
My comfort movie is the labyrinth (the og w david bowie)
the fact that you're alive is nothing short of a miracle.
I’m proud of you for not taking the bones home.
lmfao GARRETT i soooo love the way u are!!!! dont ever change i bet we'd get along just FINE!! keep doing what ur doing!!! AWESOME!! ;p
im commenting late but i still want to say my comfort movie is IT  (2017) i cant even explain why,,, your videos always make my day :)
Isn’t that Shane Dawson first house?
My comfort movie is The Ritual 🥹
19:31 for anyone who wants to skip the boringly long preparation and travel stage of this video. Honesty could've cut out most of this video to make it more watchable tbh  "2 hours later" Yeah it felt like that long just to get to the interesting part of the video. Like I'm not a hater, I really enjoyed his video of going to an abandoned asylum but I had to skip half of that video too so I've just come to expect this sort of rambling nonsense from him  To be clear, I find him very entertaining most of the time. I'm just not into the long-winded preparing that he does for his crazy exploration type videos
the never ending story
guess where garrett watts wants to escape?
My comfort movie is nightbreed
I was eating taco bell when Garrett got taco bell.
My comfort movie is white Christmas
Is nobody gonna talk about the butter knife in the cookies, what kind of magic was that
The 1977 Pete’s Dragon or Howls moving castle
8:03 What is that first question? lol 18:32 Oh boy.. 18:42 Thank goodness lol 27:54-27:57 So sweet 30:07-30:18 The Perfect Sisters. I always find myself going back to it. I've seen it a MILLION times!
One day, GW will get older and playing the part of a crazy child won't be so attractive.  It's sad really.
My comfort movie is either Beetlejuice or Grease!!!
Mine would have to be pretty woman or any Adam Sandler movies. Oldies relax me and make me feel safe 🤗 also I'm so happy you're feeling good about that experience! ♡ stay healthy
Garret are you okay?? 👀
Ferris Bueller
Pride and prejudice, gross point blank, and pretty in pink
I love ur fibe bruh keep up the awesome work!!
Does anyone know what plays at 24:45?
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty always makes me happy. No idea why. Maybe the music? Or the cinematography? Not sure- but I love it.
Literally not what agnostic means.
who framed roger rabbit
okay im super late but my comfort movie is twilight lmao it's so ridiculous it genuinely makes me happy
The way I yelled because I said 50 first days at the same time you did 😩 that n forgetting Sarah Marshall, goblet of fire or the sorcerers stone,  return of the king and YES COCO AS WELL!! ur just like me 😂
that fact that i have also propped up my phone in my bathroom to watch cowboy bebop while brushing my teeth...
It would be Hot Fuzz, I think I can watch that movie all day everyday... hmmm but I can also do that with The Fifth Element.... but I also love all The Conjuring movies...… this is a hard question...
I have my bunbun who bounces away my night terrors.
BTW my comfort movie Black Panther and Insidious 😆
We love you Garrett.
I am so proud of Garrett for buying a car. This man makes me smile more than anything
Notting hill is my comfort movie 🙈
Hercules
I'm a little disappointed at the missed "Scarebear" opportunity at 14:50. But Garrett had other things on his mind so I can't be too sad.
I also have the Hermione Granger wand and the spell for help is Periculum.
I like how garrett's beard grew on me throughout the video and at the end I wish he didn't shave it off
donnie darko
Garrets life is what happens when you let your chaotic thoughts win
garrett i dont think zombies were ur main concern out there, im surprised u aint run into a goddamn tweaker out there in the cuts
i tend to watch shows more than films so i dont think i have a comfort film (maybe if i think hard enough) but my comfort show is brooklyn 99. i watched it for so long even after finishing it and its just so entertaining and feels so much like home...
My comfort movie is a silent voice  Ive watched it over 40 times and cried each time
How do you have so many connections (regarding the detective friend bit)
true over the garden wall vibes when you are burying ur spider friend
6 ft. lanky goof ball and local good boy stuffs himself into a children's tent made for a 4 year old...
My comfort movie is fox and the hound :)
I feel like you are my inner me dying to get out but it can't  😆😁
Omg wrightwood 🥹
ok i think im sorta done binging everything that looks interesting at this immediate moment... i'm hooked. more videos please. also my comfort movie is back to the future but you can't tell me marty is straight you just can't.
13:16 Garrett does a tiny whippet? Lmfao
RIP bathroom window spider. You did a great thing burying your friend. Much love to you, Garrett.  -- Amy in Dallas PS. Wish we were friends <3
It’s the… “Not me eating room temperature grapes researching how to escape Los Angeles”.. for me
I think Halloweentown has been my comfort movie lately but I have many lol
Omg my comfort movie is El Dorado or Wall-E  No hesitation
Oh my gosh- Garrett in this vid reminds me of a lumberjack-
Imagine the horror that cop would feel if they pulled you over for driving in the carpool lane and then saw that demon baby strapped into a car seat in the back 💀
I think my comfort movie is the parent trap! its very nostalgic to me
my comfort movie is rocky horror picture show ive watched it way 2 many times
Always enjoy life lessons with Garrett
Comfort t.v. show of all timeeee is Arthur ♡
Is anyone cool up near eugene, oregon? I need like minded fun friends :) that wont murder me in the woods...
This makes me wanna... idk... live more. Do things with me for me!
Mine are the how to train your dragon movies
The Parent Trap, and many others, but DEFINITELY Parent Trap
Piranha (1978), and To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything, Julie Newmar (1995) have always been comfort movies for me. There are tons more, but I'll keep it to two for now! Haha
Idk how I missed this video sooner!!! If you had asked Andrew before going, he definitely would have told you it was a bad idea 😂 also the Harry Potter movies, Land of the Lost with Will Ferrell, Lilo and Stitch, The Incredibles 1 and 2, and the Austin Powers movies and all of my comfort movies. Though, I do have seasonal comfort movies like Hocus Pocus, The Grinch, White Christmas, Ghostbusters, etc. Anyway, I love your videos!!! ❤💜💕
30:21 my comfort movie is Ponyo and my comfort show is cowboy bebop
i love how his thumbnails look all serious n intimidating then you click on the video & its just him giggling like a little child lol
Ghost adventures ong
Can someone PLEASE tell me where the bear is from
Haven't been getting notifications! So playing catch up with your videos. Your "cabinet of curiosity" is very wtiches alter vibes.. wonder if you realize your basic a medium witch lol.
with and forever be the Kung fu panda movies, one day woke up and watch each movie multiple times and never got tired of em, I love em with my entire being
did anyone see the are lobsters immortal in his serch history
since the new video, i have been rewatching all of the old ones 🥰  each night I have watched a different one with a hot chocolate and bowl of strawberries 🍓 you’re videos always make me smile !!
Garrett you are loved.
can  i go too?
My 3yr old has that tent! 😂 I feel like I am watching a mental break down..
How on earth did I miss this?
Story time (kinda): Some D&D friend of mine decided to play this one shot, where you basically play as  yourself. You've decided to live in the woods and now have to make up the surroundings/story by drawing cards from a deck. And it was so fun and wholesome and idyllic..    And when we were done all three of us just kinda sat there on the floor, looking at the map we had created of our little cabin, our animals and all the mysterious, creepy and magical things surrounding us. Runes, ancient technology, a creepy, lone standing door, this fea dude in a bordeaux suit and top hat. And we all kinda wished that we could actually live there.  TLDR: me and two D&D friends played a one shot about escaping into a magical forest, and all mourn that we couldn't live there irl.
It’s funny cuz my old friends used to steal those off of cars and sell them it’s more common then you think and I live in mass
Coco is not anymore, but used to be a comfort movie of mine. I remember once watching it like three times in a row but I would change the language each time. Right now its probably the Stardust Crusaders OVA movie from the 90's to be completely real. Still cool imo
rango
the most fucked up thing he did in this video was actually the lettuce in the taco bell bean burrito
Flight of the concords vibe in the keep with the keyboard
Just watching this and omg the catalytic converter was stolen off my Honda Element TWICE! After the first time I had them install a big protective cage around the converter to make it harder to saw off..... so naturally the thieves just TOOK MY ENTIRE CAR BY WRAPPING A CHAIN AROUND THE AXEL AND DRAGGING IT TO A DITCH OFF THE INTERSTATE ROAD AND SAWING OFF THE CONVERTER ANYWAY. Don’t leave your car in movie theater parking lots, kids!!!!! also, you won’t get anything back from your car insurance unless you have full coverage (•:
Garrett actually has a really good singing voice 💕
I've never even been to ca and I knew it was all desert.
Mine is National Treasure with Nicolas Cage 😅😅
watching Garrett be so relatable to me, makes me think I need to just embrace myself as I am.
This video always reminds me of that episode from the office. 😂
I'd weirdly really love Garrett driving around and exploring weird stuff or houses at the side of the road...
okay I totally understand wanting to stick with that hairdresser if they play Erykah Badu.
do a real 48 hr campinging trip... i did it in wales every year with my dad. wood be great to see you do it with someone.. mayybe with shane d?
I need to go to your salon. It sounds perfect. 😍
Garrett is the embodiment of ADHD
HELL TO THE FUCKIN YEAH!!! ABSOLUTELY ADORE YOU GARRETT AND YOUR DAMN SINGING VOICE IS REALLY REALLY AMAZING! EVEN JOKING AROUND IT WAS AWESOME!  509 LUV
And I appreciate you Garrett!
1:40 wait…………….. I just leaned something new about my self, THANKS GARRET!!!
I know I'm VERY late but my comfort movies are Nightmare Before Christmas and The Lord of the Rings trilogy.
Wait, you can sing? 🤣
I think my comfort movie is rocky horror picture show
7 brides for 7 brothers is my comfort movie
Garrett, Moulin Rouge was the theme of a show I was in when I was in high school. I know the soundtrack very well because we used to listen to it on repeat as we got ready every show day! Are you singing “Your Song” in the car when you cut out the music? (Excellent CD choice whether you are or not!😀)
50 first dates is so iconic ♥
These videos are always my safe place because you feel like a friend. I've been watching you for so long and I feel like I've grown, while seeing you grow and I relate to you a lot. Take care of yourself ❤
Coraline or any studio Ghibli movies
Not a big movie person but my comfort show is friends :) or Steven universe
Not a big movie person but my comfort show is friends :) or Steven universe

I want you to do this again but with a tent mansion (that you have to make bc I don't where to buy one) and try to survive p.s get lots of food, water, etc
Comfort movie would be either tuck everlasting or twilight :) twilight was my fave as a teen and I watch it to reminisce and then tuck everlasting is a cute love story that is underrated :)
My comfort movie is the 1985 film “Clue.”
you need a doggie friend for your adventures lol.
spirited away!! ♥️♥️♥️
Garrett I promise you can enjoy this, but please next time prepare dawg especially with a larger tent.
i get concerned with myself sometimes because watching you do that in the woods seemed ok and fun and normal to me and then all the comments taking about manic episode freaked me out because ive had one of those before and i did indeed go into the woods in the snow for over an hour alone and i worried my family but i just felt bliss the entire time. my point is even if this is a manic episode for you garret i just want you to know you never fail to make me laugh and i insipire to be like you ik youll prob never see this but thank you so much for just being you <3  edit: also my fav comfort movie is prob freedom writers or jaws
“ESCAPE FROM LOS ANGELES”  A dirty 80s cut chic comic book style film.
18:32 as someone who loves taxidermy it physically pained me when he didn’t take all those nice bones
24:54 there was a light in back haha
13:53 Benjamin is always a MUST
Rocky Horror Picture Show is my fave comfort movie. Campy is always good for comfort movies, at least for me.
26:20 didiwatch this already? O yeah I remember being scared for your lifeXD
its giving michael scott
I'm convinced Garrett has ADHD because I see so much of myself in him but I haven't heard him say either way.  Although I'm late to the party on this video, Garrett running away to live in the woods is similar to me wanting to pack a backpack and go to another country.  He packs a lot of unnecessary items, bad food, no water and no clothes.  Yes.  I have watched this video to the very end and I am convinced Garrett has ADHD because he is sounding like me.  Or am I sounding like him?  Or are we sounding the same?  🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔.  Either way he is a dear of a man and I like him.  But am also concerned about and for him.  COMFORT FILM: My comfort films are Tim Burton's 'THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS' and 'CORPSE BRIDE' and Henry Selick's 'CORALINE' which some people have mentioned here.  I also like 1950's Monster Movies.
I don’t really have a comfort movie but I have a confort show, Rick and Morty 🙃
Why did this make me wanna watch 8 mile
over prepared but yet somehow has nothing at all
My comfort film is treasure planet
How… how did I learn a life lesson from this?
"Fighting the primal urge to run away into the woods" is something I relate to on a very deep level. Maybe I should stop fighting too.
Comfort movie: Cinderella 2 and A Cinderella Story 😌
why i actually went to watch this video trying to actually learn how to move to nature. Knowing full well this is garret watts channel 😅😅😅😅
Its the "are Lobsters immortal" for me 7:32😂😭
Omg 2D
50 first dates, diary of bridget jones and the cornetto trilogy are my comfort films.
Wanted to comment how good he looks here w the hair and all but this video made me genuinely worry he was actually losing it
He's so sweet 🥺🥺 he got the spider a coffin 😭💔 ugh he'd be perfect for me my family says I'm childish (not in a bad way) and I also love knickknacks anything distracts me my room is filled with random things and I don't know it's other little things I see in Garrett 😍 he's so adorable
okay comfort movies: the birdcage, star wars original trilogy, the secret garden, harry potter movies 1 & 2, the history of future folk, practical magic, and legally blonde lol
When you miss Garrett so you just re what’s old uploads
Someone literally stole my catalytic converter. Im in the middle of nowhere ohio. So fun.

THE SKELETON IN THE POOL KILLED ME
I think its funny cause i think i know where exactly he is
you need to come to NZ and live out your hobbit dream
i paused this to go get my green grapes from the fridge and they were MOLDED so i sadly unpaused the video RIGHT AS YOU STARTED EATING GRAPES AND SAYING HOW GOOD THEY ARE. very unfair :(
This is the best packing we've ever seen garrett do.
I actually think you look really attractive you goof 🤩🤩🤩
So werid to hear him cuss
garrett leaving a trail of cookies is so him and calmed my anxiety for a second
I have a whole letterboxd comfort movie list but my top fave is a tie between little miss sunshine, the Florida project and Boy
Man I wish I had a little bit of chaotic energy in me. I would've been super productive in my life.
Shane’s series on the queen mary is my comfort watch no matter the time. Favorite series by far
Am I the only one who things Garrett looks like zeke jeager?

My comfort movie is any of the Star Wars because they’re the best
13:40 😭
He is unaware of his ADHD and bipolar disorder.  He admits it but till doesn't understand the severity.  It is grueling just to watch.
Lost moment when talking about putting the skeleton in the bear costume... Bearcrow!!!!  Anyone?  No? 😂
*burial
This reminded me of when a little kid gets mad at their parents and packs up a random assortment of toys and "runs away".
Hey Garrett it’s Mothers Day 2022, Im just re watching some of your content. Can’t wait for your next video
please take care of yourself, garrett. i want to put a casual lmao, but like for real tho. the aristocats, the many adventures of winnie the pooh, and pride and prejudice (2205) are my comfort movies btw ;w;
i too have a guard skeleton at my house. she sits at our dining room table (in view of all the windows), dresses up seasonally, & her name is margarita :)
When the fake tree hit him it literally scared the crap out of me 🤣
Mine is probably the goldfinch great book and great movie ☺️
I want to be Garrett’s friend so bad 😔
14:25
Little Women with Winona Ryder
Don’t we all have that urge to just wonder off and get lost.
garrett i hope ur ok. I love ur videos cause theyre so genuine and ur so entertaining without even trying but are u ok? I am a bit worried
The fact that you have a 2006 Prius to this day is just amazing 💀
LOL when your comfort movie is any horror film old & new 🤣I'm glad you're safe Garrett! Thank you for always giving me a reason to smile! I love you Garrett you adorable precious lil' bean! 💖
Saw the thumbnail, my face: 🙀🙀🙀😰😨😨😨 Then saw the title 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Not disappointed for clicking on this video.  I literally have been laughing.... rare for me lol. It's about time,  'you seem like you again!
my name is nirvana and the slight moment he said it in the beginning made my heart melt:-)
Hail Eris
19:02 That's soooo Kill Bill Vol.2..... Wait.... YOU HAD A KATANA!!!! 😱
I’ve never needed a T-shirt more that said :  being agnostic;  •”I’ll just die and see what happens… LOL”
I wish we could be friends in person we would vibe so well 😂😂
22:34 - 22:42 is honestly the Funniest thing I've ever heard
Your videos have literally changed how I view life. You’ve helped me adopt a happier mindset. I appreciate your content so much. Thank you for being you, Garrett!
He is my brain 🧠 my whole entire brain is Garrett
My life flashed before my eyes when Garrett edited in him getting hit with a very large log.
Listen, Garrett you're living you're best life and I love that! But be careful, I think some carpool lanes have heat sensors on their cameras or I was lied to-- But!! Just something to be careful about.
Why hasn’t somebody hired him as an actor
one of my comfort movies is Rise of the Guardians! also pretty much any 2010's animated movies
comfort film: scott pilgrim vs. the world
The sandlot is my comfort movie
Anyone know which Moulin Rouge song Garrett was singing??  16:41
i dont really have a comfort movie but i have a hella comfort show, its called the good place its on netflix and its literally so good omg ive watched it all the way through TOO MANY TIMES
He talks and talks shut up
They stole our catalytic converter here too lol
This is how you do the self depreciation that was popular in the 2010s 😂 Ehhem
I have lots of comfort movies… Bridesmaids, Princess Bride… that’s 2
I am soooooo glad Garrett did not spend the night in the wild. Sooo happy he is safe💙
yes
Bo burnham is you on steroids
Shag the Movie! 💕
This is my life. I am Garrett. 😅
3:30 shut the front door..  WHY WAS I DOING THIS EXACT THING WHILE WATCHING YOUR VIDEO?!?! If that’s not some weird simulation, alternate dimensions type shit.. idk what is lmaooo. That tripped me out so much! 🤣
Mine is The Dark Crystal ;3
My comfort movie is Coco, actually! Specifically in Spanish. I'm Mexican-American. So I relate to the whole Mexican culture the movie is based on, especially with the Day of the Dead. I'm not a movie person but surprisingly, it's the only movie I can watch over and over again without getting sick of it. The art, voices, music, settings, they all bring me a sense of home. That's my comfort movie =)
Fantastic Mr.Fox is such a comfort movie for me, or it's megamind and ponyo
dude it weirds me out so much looking at you. i am mini you
Hi Garrett 💓 I love your videos especially around this time this year I'm going through a lot & I started to lose hope but then suddenly I came across one of your videos & now I can't stop watching them 🥰 you are so positive & I freaking love you ❤️ lol I can't say that enough ☺️ I hope the new year is treating u well so far hope to see some new videos soon 🙏🏽
I love u
I literally flinched when that fake tree fell on Garrett lmao
3:31 is me if i saw a bat
You went into a haunted hospital with DISCO LIGHTS  after it told u to “please stop” - they have come for revenge
Terrible?  Nah, I think you're a total fkin babe.  ☺️
What are the odds that I watch this video when my catalytic converter just got stolen a couple days ago too😂
When is the next sweet boys episode!?!?!?!? I need more
Mine are probably just all the Harry Potter movies OH MY GOD JINX
I really wanna know how Andrew reacted to this video— or to this idea but i had a feeling i already know hahaha
My comfort movies are The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and Pacific Rim
my comfort movie is Shazam! (2019) boy oh boy i love that movie!!
I've been sad that I haven't been able to go to high school or have a normal teen life. And I have bee scared to grow up. But this made me feel okay with getting old and reminded me that my peak won't be as a teenager and once I am older, I'll be able to drive around and still have fun or be terrified in the woods. Thanks garrett! Love the videos <3 (but I would never go into the woods alone because that was so scary to watch)
Comfort movie: Wine Country!!! On Netflix. Highly recommend
Okayyy Garrett listening to Erykah Badu
no joke.. Garrett's got a good singing voice. kinda wanna hear him sing for real
I love watching the stuff you make and am so glad you didn't die lol when I finally got big-brained enough to look up your OWN channel after the twentieth time watching your episode of Puppet History, that was one of the smartest things I've ever done. Yay gold star for me. Some of my favorite comfort movies include but are not limited to: The Thirteenth Warrior, Kung-fu Hustle, Practical Magic, Spirited Away, The Book of Kells.
Very late but I don't really have a comfort movie, I do however have a comfort anime which is called "12-sai" it takes me back to being 12 and I relate so hard to the concept of being 12 and not being fully an adult or a child at that point in your life
Harry Potter 2 (I have the words memorized😭) other than that I used to watch the Lorax every night
My family and I love you Garrett❤️💯🥰!!!
thats omnist not agnostic !!! /lh
I just want to let you know that I'm going through a rough patch mentally and your videos are the only thing genuinely keeping me sane. You have provided me with so much comfort and made me laugh when I though I couldn't, and I know you don't know me but I do really love you for that.
When Garrett watts makes you figure out your religion:😨😨😨
We're having a huge problem with people stealing Catalytic converters in Portland Oregon too. My work has two box trucks they use to help people move or clear abandoned apartments. First, we had to get a locking gas cap because they kept stealing the gas, then when they couldn't do that anymore, they stole the catalytic converters. Some co-workers/tenants got theirs stolen off their personal vehicles as well. I think the only reason why my mom hasn't gotten hers stolen is because it's pretty buried in the rest of the mechanicals. Kia sportage for the win!
Bridge to terabithia, or Avengers
Bravo
How can u talk that fast and that much alone 😭😭😭😭🤣🤣
"0 percent peperation" 🤣🤣🤣
Shawshank Redemption
my comfort movie is parent trap with lindsy lohan
Garret you have to be more careful. A bear could have used a power saw to steal the adventure jeep's catalytic converter at any time.
I was very seriously considering kms until I saw this video and now I'm just smiling because he's silly like me : )
One time I went camping by myself and genuinely scared myself that zombies were going to come out of the woods through the grass clearing while I was sitting around my fire making ramen in a pan.... I was roughly 18 at the time... It was a great trip.
Garrett you need to go to the Harry Potter Studio tour in London!
My favorite comfort movies are Pride and Prejudice (2005) and Tammy and the Bachelor.
Garrett ......... the wip ..... really lol
Low key want this channel to be the adventures of Garrett and Andrew 😂❤️
i think everyone can agree that garretts" laugh is the cutest
Whisper of the Heart was always one of my comfort movies!!
flaming is great
My comfort movie actually is Conjuring 2😂 I love that movie! Next would be any Clamation film of any kind! And anything with Jonny Depp💕😊
awh garret your not alone i have the same primal urge to ditch everything and live unprepared in the woods. that realization of gratitude reentering the modern world is so refreshing and i’m proud of you hahahah
my comfort movie is luca!! :)
my comfort movie is Beetlejuice! pretty much any Tim Burton movie, but Disney movies also bring me a lot of comfort. it's all that magical feeling that things are ok :)
Either Garret is super rich to still be alive or is in super debt
this reminds me of Chris McCandles thought process from the Biography "Into The Woods"
Thanks so much for your videos, really cheer me up very boring depressing being a 40 year old woman you bring out the light hearted nature I used to have once apon a time xxx much love
this might be the most chaotic thing he's ever done lol
Garrett that is very dangerous wandering onto an unknown persons property. Some Deer hunters often shoot at movement thinking it is a deer... I know you have a bright shirt on but people hunt deer for food and alot of times they don't want to miss their one shot that took weeks of hunting. They can't always see clear!y thru the woods, they only have seconds to shoot while in range and they don't expect that someone would wander into their woods. You can go to a state park and be protected from a shooting accident.
Andrew save this guy please
Come to South Carolina! I've got lots of woods on my property and I will let you stay in my beautiful camper!!
The Lord giveth.and he can taketh away....contemplating religion= show me a sign= I gave you car,phone,refrigeragor,hogwarts...Now I will take them away😆 I believe that there is 1 creator and people call him by many names.Here's your sign! Acknowledge and trust in the ONE that created YOU and you will find that you are on a great adventure!
I love you so much
Nostic
Omg I'm agnostic too 🤗
For some reason my comfort movies are the Harry potter series and the lost boys. Alot of those 80s teen flicks even though i was a 90s teen.

Garret Being Iconic (16:35): "FIFTY BUCKS! Ugh, that's a new wand."
I still have that same CVS first aid kit that one of my aunts bought me when I first moved into my own home in 2011. The band aids are all useless now.
Monsters Inc and The Grinch on Christmas.
wow u really hansel and gretled urself.
I love Garrett so much. I've been depressed and not doing much and he inspires me. This is how my life has been... a mountain a poo piling up and I'm overwhelmed and I shut down, but this shows me that other people go through it and we should just laugh about it instead of get upset bc that's just how the ginger snap of life crumbles. Love you Garrett!
E.T. has always been and always will be my comfort movie 😤
people are literally stealing cadillidic converters from students' cars parked in the school student parking lot... in my small town with a population of 2,000 people 💀
i relate to you on a spiritual level garrett & im so glad that you put content out in the world for everyone to see. truly wish the best for you
Harry Potter
U look like Chris cringle in Santa clause is coming to town 🎅🦌

All Garrett needs is a semi large dog and then he becomes real life Shaggy
Musicals are big comfort movies for me. Gerard butlers phantom of the opera, mamma Mia, Chicago, nightmare before Christmas. Titanic is a big one. Man. I just love movies so much for so many different reasons.
I hope so hard that the “burglar” was Andrew

I love the Bo Burnham reference
I live for this man's manic energy
Our ancestors would think we’re wack af for having to make reservations to sleep in the woods…😂
BROO, I live in Richmond and my Prius catalytic converter just got stolen too. Because of the supply shortage they can sell them for even more for scrap. It's getting so wild that some states (Washington for example) are trying to introduce new laws about selling scraps. My partner posted on our neighborhood website that mine got stolen and found a thread with over 100 people in the last month whose got stolen in Richmond. Pruis is especially vulnerable to it. WILDDDD Be careful out there folks. I ended up selling my car anyways, but you bet I'll have cameras on my next car. LOL
my comfort movie is Moana, its so beautiful and the songs are amazing. I have watched it like 30 times
Idk if you’ll see this, but my comfort movies are Son in law (Pauly shore is fantastic and I think you would love it), spirited away, howl’s moving castle, and also all the Harry Potter movies. 💕
I adore Garret with and without a beard. 🥺
Garrett's the most adorable man I've ever seen! I would love to be friends with him!
...my comfort movie is most definitly Rocky Horror Picture Show....something about an alien in fishnets dancing is very comforting...somehow...but I'm sure you understand aha!! Love you Garrett, you are such a gem xx

Me watching Garrett's mouth to see hes singing your song 🎵 🥰😍
My personal movie/movies is probably also the Harry Potter movies ✨
Actually no agnostic explicitly means a person who believes in nothing. If you believe in something, anything, you are not agnostic.
Guess that's also him not taken shane moving away very well.

Why did that spider burial make me cry??
Wow this is the first video I’ve seen of just yours. I always REALLY loved seeing you in Shane’s videos. You are HILARIOUS and I couldn’t relate more to running into the wild because of the chaos. I kinda did that and realized myself that I need to do modern life better and be more grateful 🥴😂❤️
Garrett cures my depression
If feel if I lead 12 would find this entertaining. I’m not 10 anymore.

Garrett over here talking about zombies in the woods, and all I can think is, "That sounds like a bear, sir, please get back in your jeep!"  And as for comfort movies, I'd have to say The Secret of NIMH, The Avengers, and Spirited Away!
I'm glad you made it out of the woods and back home safe!! Still thinking of going back for that abandoned trailer or checking out the hut? 😂   My comfort movie is Howls Moving Castle, 50 First Dates is my favorite non anime movie!! That and Terminal..

"No phone, no lights, no motor car, not a single luxury.  Like Robinson Caruso, it's primitive as can be!"  I suggest you move to Gilligan's Island.  You would definitely make the perfect Gilligan if they ever did another reboot (like they did in the 90s).
Just move to Joshua Tree like all the other LA hipsters.
::smiling:: thank youuuuu 😌
The hobbit and lord of the rings series 😅
“Hasee to Phasee”(Bollywood) and “pride and prejudice”( 2005 ver)😁.

My comfort movies are a tie between Matilda and Harriet the Spy. They give off the same vibe. Also, in a weird way they make me feel less alone..? Two outcast girls who don’t fit in with normal society expectations? That is me to the nth degree. So happy to see another quality Garrett vid. 🥰
GARRETT MY CATALYTIC CONVERTER WAS STOLEN TOO
Any of the Mary poppins movies
Why is there a little cup of tea in the bottom right corner after his list of bad things and hogwarts?

Garret likes ANIME?
Garret is my favorite human being ever
I love this video
I would literally do the same thing if I could no joke
If you get a 9mm pistol, you can say “I got an EMF reader and a 9 millimeter”. Just putting that out there.
My comfort movie is Sharkboy and Lavagirl 😂 I’ve loved this movie since I was a teeny tiny little kid. It always made super happy, even though it isn’t the best movie out there.
Moana is my most recent comfort movie. I have more comfort series, than movies.
Garrett, if you ever go back into the woods like this PLEASE wear a bright safety vest!
As soon as you said COCO I got so happy! I was literally about to type that Coco is my all time comfort movie. At one point I watched it every night for a month 🧡
You look like a lumberjack
I feel like we would be really good friends
💘💘💘💘💘
My comfort movies: Hellboy 1 and 2. They're so visually interesting to look at, it helps my brain not fixate on sad/upsetting things that are currently happening in my life. The Mask, Beetlejuice, Ghostbusters, Muppet Treasure Island. These are movies I watched alot as a kid when times were simpler. They just make me feel better. c:
i got a mini heartattack when he edited the tree that fell on him

A part of me is kinda genuinely worried for Garrett
LOTR, Harry Potter, The pagemaster and probably pride and prejudice with Mathew McFadyen and Keira Knightly or the Colin firth one as well.

no andrew feels weird
Garrett, babe, you’re pantheistic. Not agnostic 😂
I know this sounds weird but anything scary is a comfort movie for me. I think it’s because I have really bad anxiety and I know I’m in control of it, it’s something I can control, I can turn it off, I can pause it, I can close my eyes, and I know it’s not real and it will be over and it’s all not happening to me! Lol  I think it’s cause it also stops my thoughts of anxiety of things in the future or in the past your just focusing on the scaryness? Is that a word? Lol but besides that mean girls hahaha and anything with Brittany Murphy RIP.
My friends and I went kayaking and found bones arranged really strangely next to a bunch of old bottles. We showed the police who said there was a body found a county over last month and that there were a few missing persons. The bones were so ambiguous that they sent a state trooper into the swamp to investigate and we didn't hear from them for a few days. 'Twas a deer in the end but it was still a fun experience.
My comfort movie is either Clue or How to Train Your Dragon. Depending on what mood I’m in; am I in the mood to laugh, or am I in the mood to be soft?

1:25 lmao Garrett ily man but agnostic just refers to believing the fact the existence or lack thereof a higher power is unprovable and unknowable (at least currently), that enough evidence has not been provided to objectively determine any such existence, and PROBABLY MAYBE never will. It's basically shrugging as a religious designation. Believing in/worshipping everything/every god is Omnitheism, or Pantheism (though I more often see Pantheism used to refer to deification of the universe so I usually use omnitheism). So it sounds like you'd technically be an agnostic omnitheist/omnitheist agnostic, since you seem like a bit of both.
As a fellow agnostic, "I'll just die and see what happens" is the perfect way to describe my feelings on the matter. I will now be stealing this saying, and hopefully that doesn't come back to bit me in whatever form the afterlife might take. 😘

In a world full of grossness this is just so wholesome. I love it.
,,,bro this is so weird, I had a mental breakdown like at the end of August and I ran off into the woods (I live in the woods) completely barefoot with the hope that I would just like,,, die of exposure, and I wandered until I knew I was lost and found a patch of ferns. I started picking the ferns to make a bed cause it was getting dark and I laid down on the bed of ferns and tried to go to sleep when a literal bear showed up and we stared at each other for like 5 seconds and then i slowly got up and she reared up (two cubs were there i couldnt really see them through the ferns) and i just started sprinting in the pitch black woods and i was so lost i had to use my iphone gps to find my house and i limped back home and my mom was like “,,, can we talk” and i was like “fuck off” and got in the shower to try to scrub dirt out of my cuts and realized I was covered in deer ticks. All in all 10/10 most destructive mental breakdown since my suicide attempt in 10th grade. Thanks for this video reminder of that harrowing little venture!

Agnosticism is about "not knowing" so basically "I don't know either way" not "I believe in everything." But I get that he was going for
As you were asking about the comfort movies, I was like mine is defined 50 First Dates HAHAAHHAAHAH and you said the same thing lol love u
I think something followed you back from the hospital 👻💀
I very much relate to the vibe of just seeing any abandoned place whatsoever and immediately going “I’m gonna live there!” I truly just really want to live in a weird little abandoned junk pile in the middle of nowhere
My neighbor totoro or spirited away
Can I do comfort tv shows cause…. THE OFFICE 💜
This upload was only one week ago wtf? Time is strange I feel I watched it so long ago.
Is he bipolar? This looks like a pure manic episode. Very boring too.
spirited away is actually my comfort movie so it made a lot of sense when u brought it into the woods with u
My comfort movies are probably Dead Poet's Society and Princess Bride. I used to watch Princess Bride every single time I was sick and my grandma had to take care of me in elementary :)

I have a FEW comfort movies.. hocus pocus, Pollyanna from 1960, Spooky house (that NO ONE seems to have seen but you would LOVEEE it Garrett), the master of disguise, bedknobs & broomsticks from 1971, the garbage pail kids from 1987, Andre (the movie with the seal) and Gordy (the movie with the pig both from 1994. Great movies. I know I have a lot.. and there are more💀
My comfort movie is the mummy (1999) of course! I’ve watched it countless times and will never get tired of it!
Garrett is so random and slightly crazy and i dont know why i relate to him so much
Garrett I need your help. Under another comment I made a week ago so many girls started to reply. The problem is that there porn girls and have nasty profile pictures and they won't stop. This was bad for your followers
But those bones on the side of the road should be reported. They look like a small child's.
My comfort movie is Cars; kachow!
my comfort movie is Coraline :))
Love seeing you flourishing xxx
The comfort movie that came to mind immediately was ELF im more of a comfort book/show person Book is frog and toad!! Show is avatar the last airbender!! And also you are just the best bean thankyou for being so authenticly you 🥰😊
Get rid of the beard now burn it with fire
It chapter two is my comfort film! I just adore the characters so much.
The movie Knocked Up by Seth Rogen is my comfort movie, I have no fucking clue why.
Garret bb don't leave food out for your safety and spiders love an eco friendly burial 🥰
"How to escape LA" I'm surprised a popup window didn't show saying pay 8 million + 200m in taxes to find out 😂
Ah it's time for my semi-annual "Let's See if Garrett Watts Uploaded!" Three whole videos since the last time I looked! Garrett, you've outdone yourself. Love much!
So happy you're safe Garrett! Also, my comfort movie is Mulan (the original one), could watch it FOREVER.
My comfort movies are: Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Blade Runner, Tangled, Princess Bride, and Pick of Destiny
Let me cut your hair???? 😂😂
I've been thinking about "off grid life" a lot lately. This helped. A lot lol.  😂😂😂😂
I see signs all the time. Its all very real, you seem to have an angel or two on your side.
garrett im serious you should fully stay in cerro gordo in california for a while
Backpacked across Ontario, where whatever what was in my backpack was either life or death and this video is giving me SO much anxiety when you were packing your supplies 😂💀
Mercury retrograde lol
im five minutes in but garrett i think youre haunted
Loved this whole video, such a mood. Also my comfort movie is Pride and Prejudice (2005), I watch it very often, especially when things don't feel right. One year my parents bought it for me on Christmas and each time I move, it is in my Day 1 bag of essentials.
My comfort movie is Hairspray! Definitely my favourite movie:)
Garrets videos helped me a lot when trying to get sober. Just the nice, positive nature of his videos made me feel better. So Garrets videos is my comfort watch
GARRETT those are the best ginger cookies!! How dare you leave them for squirrels!!
Here is a question!! Do you think Shane watches his videos?  I sure hope so!
I don't really have a comfort movie but I do have comfort shows daredevil and Jessica jones :) they keep me going... truly
my comfort movies are pulp fiction and the lion king 😌
Clue. I could literally watch it a million times and still love it!
My comfort movie is My Big Fat Greek Wedding!
My comfort movie would probably be One Direction: This Is Us just because they're my favorite people and the fact that they have a documentary is just perfect for me as a comfort film lol. If we exclude documentaries probably the Harry Potter films.
Its Alex’s Alpine Oaisis for Boys lol
My comfort movie is legally blonde 🥰
are you ok ?
Garrett is such a blessing
I wish I could be your friend tbh. You're so carefree and fun and excited about life. I'd be sad about something, and you'd run over to one of those toy vending machines and get a little dinosaur toy and show me and be like "look at its little teeth" and we'd giggle.
Spice World has been my comfort movie since I was four years old. I still have the vhs copy of it somewhere. 💕
Blair witch vives
Howls moving castle is a great movie to watch
I love how unprepared he was for everything. Not having enough drinks, shivering in 40 degrees weather… and when that man went into that small ass tent I started cackling 😂
The Devil Wears Prada will forever and always be my comfort movie
coraline 110%

My comfort movie is The Fifth Element
4:55 why is there a random cup of tea/coffee 😂
i'm agnostic too! 🙋🏽‍♀️ we stan a normalizing king!
My comfort movie is definitely Dead poets society because I used to watch it with my mom and I feel so nostalgic whenever I watch it!
More content Garrett !
when i was younger it was eloise at the plaza (2003 live action version specifically) and i had to watch it after every horror movie because i told myself that i wouldnt have nightmares that way
two of my comfort movies are wall e and all dogs go to heaven. all dogs go to heaven was one of the movies i would repeatedly watch when i was younger
That panic is exactly how I felt when I moved to northern California in a cabin in the woods.
one of my comfort movies is charlie bartlett
i feel like everytime Garrett uploads a video he’s going through a manic episode
You took my comfort movie to the woods with you. Spirited away is my go to.
Garrett looks like he smells . . .manly
mh comfort movie is scream and the maze runner
Frozen grapes are bomb.. just sayin
Are you ok
Comfort movie: Any movie with Johnny Depp, but especially Charlie and the Choclate Factory
If ur fine falls into water Ala toilet etc. Ur supposed to stick it into a container of rice(not cooked rice no) that will take all of the moisture out of ur phone to heal it.
The greatest thing that I have ever done was get a couple of those PopSocket sticky mounts. One over the sink in the kitchen, and on in the shower. I highly recommend getting some. They really work excellently.
First of all, watching this video brought me so much joy. Second, my comfort movie is 126% the live action Peter Pan movie that came out in 2003. I literally own 3 copies and have watched it too many times to count.
I watch princess mononoke whenever I'm stressed out and i rewatch sweet boys when im alone but don't want to be. You're the best garrett (and andrew haha) hope youre doing very well <3
My comfort media is Futurama, but for a movie, probably anything studio Ghibli, and also my favorite, Harold and Maude.
Chaos magick is agnostic 😉
Yes, 50 first dates and coco!!!
WHY DID MY NOTIFICATIONS NOT GO OFF AND TELL ME ABOUT THIS A FRICKEN WEEK AGO!?!?!?!
Garrett I see your $500 opal ice 🧊 maker 🤣💁🏼‍♀️ I have one also, do you love it? Isn’t it a pain in the 🍑 to clean?
Never Been Kissed ❤️. My fave comfort movie
Okay but weird timing - my fridge broke too?? The freezer still worked, but the fridge completely gave out??
I just realized he would make a great fit for  Zeke Yeager in cosplay or an aot live action movie (hopefully a better one)
I think my comfort movie/movies is the Harry Potter series and the Narnia series. I’m not just saying that I’ve watched these movies my entire life there like the first movies I remember and I don’t know who I would be if I didn’t watch them and same with YouTube, I have a lot of comfort YouTubers including you Garrett.
Garrett i love the beard...
He's turning into a werewolf man!! Honestly kinda digging it🎃🐺🌕
My comfort movie has to be Sweeney Todd..chef's kiss
You should do a van life adventure. Travel around the states a bit 🙌🏻
Garrett are you okay? You seem a little um…manic? Love you!😍🥰😘
wait, why am I only realizing this now,  where's the All Might action figure that was in his old videos?  ; - ; Anyway I really just want to say I love all of the decorations in Garretts house I really wish I had majority of the decorations he has
i have so many freaking comfort movies. scooby doo mystery island. when harry met sally. just go with it (which i know every word too.. not to brag or anything 😏💪😐) Robin hood (1970’s version). Cinderella. mamma mia. ferris buellers day off. and probably a lot more that i can’t think of right now. i’m sorry i was a week late to this but i hope you have such a kickass day to whoever reads this

Mine is Harry Potter ONE☺ also mean girls🤌🙌😊😊
The convertor theft is a nationwide issue.. my cousins convertor was stolen also. He's from a really small town 🤷‍♀️
I love garret but I would love to know some of the actual safety precautions he takes when he does these types of dangerous videos. I just get worried. I’m sure he plays up a character in his videos bc I would be very concerned if he was truly so unprepared and naive and careless as he can come across when I remove myself from the fantasy.
Love you garrett! stay safe please! Great video. watched while drunk. I always love escaping, even if its for a few hours, as long as its enough  to open up that spirituality and connection we have with the things and happenings around us! Keep uploading!
Garrette I've been listening to you excuse your looks for too long, you have to realize I have 0 standards for clothing, or even greasy, messy hair; it's natural. I'm also blind as a bat so I just genuinely have zero *perception. You're a stunning human being and you make me happy.
Comfort movie.... Ramen Girl with Brittany Murphy
Was it the 3D puzzle of Hogwarts that fell apart at the beginning?? My cat ate mine :'))
my comfort movie is definitely "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty" if you haven't seen it, it's so amazing and so underrated
Comfort movie: The Social Network. I don’t know why. Its such a random movie. I’ve seen it so many times, and whenever I’m depressed or lonely I will sit through the whole thing all over again.
For the record, you actually look amazing. Longer hair and a beard really suit you. You're handsome as shit, Garrett! You don't look the least bit terrible.
I’m 1 billion years late but my comfort movies are labyrinth, almost famous, Beetlejuice, and the nightmare before Christmas. Love you Garrett!
When will sweet boys come back
my comfort movies are raggedy ann, any winnie the pooh movie, and corpse bride
Harry Potter, the Avengers (all of them) and Pride and Prejudice are my go-to comfort movies!
garrett just move to washington  ☔️🌲
*pulls out butter knife* gotcha bitch!
My comfort movie, and idk why, is Onward - it’s just so cute and just a fun little adventure
The Phantom Tollbooth
My freezer also makes that noise! It's only at night and we just call him "the kitchen ghost"!
HE MENTIONED BO BURNHAM IN THE INTRO 😭 OMG ILY
it’s so crazy that he asked what our comfort movie is bc I was just talking ab it lmao but mines either the Lorax or It chapter 2 which are very contrasting movies but yeah
are you and shane still friends?
Genuinely waited for Garrett to give the speech Professor Slughorn gave at Aragog’s funeral because WHAT 👏🏻AN 👏🏻OPPORTUNITY👏🏻🕷🥀
Garrett thank you for being you. You never fail to make me laugh. 😊
my comfort movie is James and the giant peach it is such a good movie!!
27:37 Value Select is shook
hearing garrett being so polite to the taco bell workers is actually so heartwarming
But👐where have ya been toots
Dude-.. Garrett please make short songs like the one you did in your car,, cuz god dammit I think it would be awesome!
Iron Man 1….I’m also glad Garrett didn’t die😂🤠
I actually really do want to do this, but more like the TV show alone where they build themselves a shelter and live off the land. I have been studying foraging for several years now and could probably make it during the summer, and maybe year round on the west coast. Come with me and be my bodyguard against bears!!
My comfort movie is literally Prisoner of Azkaban and Starstruck from Disney channel idk what that says about me
The gunshot was probably because it’s currently hunting season
One of my comfort movies is definitely pitch perfect. And ironically, i really like into the woods. i think about those films a lot
Why did Andrew leave you alone… bad Andrew
my comfort movies are .. la la land , all the pitch perfect ones , and also coco hehe ! (^・ω・^ )
I wanna run to the woods too
As a 20 year old I hate to admit my comfort show is h2o just add water
My comfort movies make me sound insane lolol, I rewatch all the Saw movies in order at least once a month when I’m feeling rough
My bell broke and i'm a week late... blahhg  edit: 13:15 Garrett sort of does a whippet hit.. wo0t
The fact that Garrett's long ass fit in that tent is quite impressive imo 😂. Comfort movie has to be Coraline. There's just something about that one, that I can really curl up to, and get a sense of childlike happiness. Guess it just sparks that little bit of innocent wonder left in me.
I’ve been in such a terrible place since school started and Garret you made me laugh more in the time span of this video that I have this entire semester. I hope you upload more often because it always brightens my days. Also what ever happened to your pet mice?
Rip lil spidey
Why is he buried that spider coffin alone in the woods at night 😭😭
Don't care. Ur a backstabbing,no loyalty post. HE is back and getting hella views 🙂
my comfort movie is the first spongebob movie. i watch it everytime i have the flu, and i had it on repeat every night of my childt
The one that comes to mind is a silent voice. It’s helps me just know I’m not alone and to keep going. A sense of peace that as long as I don’t stop it will all be okay.
27:54 omg! I wish all my customers were like Garrett! 🥰 I love this man!
The crow + lilo and stitch 😎😎
“That tree is very dead, it doesn’t have a top”  Me too Garrett, me too
If you eat lots of garlicky foods mosquitoes dont like that
My comfort movie is the Addams Family (1991)
As someone that works with catalytic converters all day currently....I know your pain Garrett. Also, I hope to leave my current shitty job and find a better one.
*are Garrett and Shane not friends anymore?*
I can imagine you living in a van and just drive around. It's  like fancy camping
i love you so much Garrett<3
Comfort movies definitely Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. And anything by Studio Ghibli
Well, and I'm gonna answer the question from the end of the video for the very first time. I have couple of comfort movies. Beetlejuice, Amelie, Pride and Prejudice from 2005. The first Harry Potter movie is one of my comfort movies too, I love to watch it with my younger sister.
Litteally Garrett, nothing you brought on this adventure will be useful in the woods. 😅
i dont know if anybody cares but my confort movies right now are: kikis delivery service, spirit, ponyo, meet joe black, he doesn’t love you, pretty woman and fantastic mr fox

Solutions: 1. Buy a new car 2. Buy a new phone 3. Buy a new fridge  4. Find a new barber  Garrett: Run away to woods
Did all this happen over mars retrograde?
You should just have a clip of Andrew sneezing, so you can insert it when you mention him and he's not around. Comfort movie, Moana. I watched The Ring Vs The Grudge and I was so scared, I rented Moana. LOL I fell asleep soundly. :)
My comfort movie is coraline, i watched it for the first time when i was 6, and it is my favorite movie to this day

Me sighing with relief you went home..lol
My comfort movie is almost famous or dazed and confused
My comfort movie is absolutely Fantastic Mr Fox
you responded to my best friend's comment a few days ago and it literally made her entire year. she was the one that said imagine that when you die, your spirit goes into Benjamin. And i just wanna thank you for not only making her year but mine too bc that was such a big shock when we saw that you replied and we both freaked out
my comfort movie has always Juno, featuring elliot page and michael cera! if i feel like crying or in need of a big old hug, it's always going to be Juno.
My all time favorite comfort movie is: Ratatouille 🧀🐀🍅 Then a close second & third out be Pretty Women & Clueless 👛
I think Hook is my comfort movie :)
I think I do have a lot of comfort movies, but for sure one that always keeps my hearth warm would be Bicenntenial man, although it makes me cry A LOT. I love jurassic park movies, and all the harry potter saga, I cannot get bored of them.
Lol as another agnostic, I literally say “ill worry about the after life when im dead, rn i got bigger problems”
Shrek for sure ❤️
scarecrow? dont you mean bearcrow?
This is giving me very much Blair Witch vibes   Omg my comfort movie, I have so many! Coco is definitely one of mine too... and 50 first dates actually. I also love Meet the Robinsons, Fantastic Four (2005), Legally Blonde, and so many other movies lol.

I get so concerned for your safety sometimes
You’re so much fun, made my day ❤️

Garrett you look perfectly fine... Who gives a damn how you look and if it's that deep then they're not truly your fans or people that care for you.
Nightmare Before Christmas or Tangled  If I need to smile either will work without fail.

PRIUS OWNERS get a Cadillac Converter lock, etch your Vin on it or park it in the locked garage. Our CCs are getting stolen at a higher rate.
Tyrion Lannister said to wear insults like armor and shield yourself.... So it fits your say it first before your bullies can motto

Extra clothes?
Blankets?
I love these videos. I always watch these as I'm getting ready for work and Garret just gives me good vibes to get through the day.
My comfort movies are the Barbie and Monster High movies. Also Aquamarine.
When I first developed my severe panic attack disorder and would have attacks all day long every day for a few months I would put in real steel while trying to sleep and it helped a lot for some reason and it made it easier to fall asleep. The beginning of the movie the pace is so peaceful and so is the music
Garrett you're silly and funny. Good to see a real person on YouTube being entertaining without flexing all their wealth and clout to us regular folk. Also glad to see you getting away from the toxicity of the "friends" I feel like I've met you through. Much too sweet of a soul to survive around others that maybe doesn't have as genuine of a heart as you. Glad to see you thriving even still through all of your not so great recent luck.
my comfort movies are shrek 2 and the lego batman movie :D
I’m here for the chaos
My comfort movie is Nightmare before Christmas, no matter how I’m feeling it always cheers me up and I have to sing all the songs.
garrett you are literally just the best. just thought i'd inform you
My comfort movies are Jaws and Ghosbusters.
WHY DID THE TREE FALLING SCARE ME😂

This video made my friday better Thank you <33e
The mummy references? You always have the best random callbacks to movies. Yes, we get you Garrett. You’re not alone ! ❤️
I believe there is actual balance to be found in between this awful modern world and nature. This video gave me a boost of confidence and i feel so much better about my recent choices. I moved to my cousin's town. Not even 500 people here. Completely sorrounded by crops, mountains, rivers, wildlife, no wi-fi. We eat a lot of normal modern human food. BUT there is always that homemade "something" to make the meal 100x better. In case i ever crave something else from that modern world there is even a *insert your country's knockoff 7/11 name here*. Im truly loving this. And i truly loved this video :)
My comfort movie is Moana LMAO
you mean to tell me that garrett posted and youtube didnt notify me until 6 DAYS LATER?!?!?!?!?!?!?
garrett found the trailer from breaking bad 😮
Thank you for making content that I can enjoy while around my 3yr old. He genuinely enjoys watching you. Lol
Comfort movies are Lion King,  Breakfast at Tiffany’s, Midnight in Paris, Now You See Me. Also not a movie but the episode Faith of Supernatural.
Your obsession with gramma's is weird but cute
Speed Racer 100% (not joking) it has everything including a boy wearing monkey pajamas and a monkey wearing boy pajamas.
My favorite comfort movies are Coraline and Mary Poppins! I used to be terrified of Coraline but I've come to love the visuals and the overall storyline! And Mary Poppins is just so comforting cause it lets me know that everything is going to be okay!

nature is so healing. i recently went away from the city to go to my family’s province, since my grandfather passed away. it was nice spending time together with all of my cousins in the middle of nowhere ^__^ there were a lot of cool bugs everywhere and i always gave them a piece of biscuit. i agree that we should learn how to use social media and socialize in the city better, but it’s not bad to escape for a while 💕

i’m really scared of spiders like i’ll cry if i see one when i’m alone at home but there’s one on my kitchen window and it’s been there for years and there will occasionally be a smaller one along with it so i think it’s just a little spider family that’s been living peacefully in my window for generations and i might be emotionally attached to them.

"Just heard a woods zombie, I know it. Or a witch" *intense terror on face* Most witches would welcome you to the forest and teach you what you can and cannot eat.  My comfort movie is the nightmare before christmas, or the breakfast club.

One of my comfort movies is Spirited Away. It got me through a tough period. I also realized I have a comfort tv show lol it's Bones. I re-watch it at least once a year. It makes me feel like all is right with the world. So obviously re-watching it now.
Garrett posted on a bones day
I’m thinking the catalytic converter theft is nationwide. I work in an auto transportation office (we pick up vehicles and transport them to my area) and the drivers will pick up vehicles that are supposed to be Run & Drive yet have the catalytic converter missing. I’ve gotten complaints a lot more this year than ever before. Luckily the drivers do take photos at pick up so it’s not been a problem for the company, but it’s unfortunate for the clients. ☹️
MY comfort movies are Peter Pan, the irl bratz movie, and bratz super babies because they made me happy as a child lmao
Garret I would just love to say thank you so much  1) u are my comfort youtuber and u are litraly adorable  2) you have helped me through the trauma and passing of my dad I know because I'm always the one that is passed that you arnt reading this but I just wanted to say   Thank you <3

This reminds me of that movie years back where a group of college teens went camping and stumbled on to an area (spoiler) where they found weird terrifying creatures that violently killed some of them. then they found a lab where the creatures escaped from..... damn what was this movie called it had a kind of Blairwitch vibe with the filming?

You might just be my favourite person on YouTube.  No, you are. You definitely are my favourite person on YouTube.  Also, comfort movie: 27 Dresses with Katherine Heigl. Yes I know it’s awful but it’s just my go to. That and Talladega Nights with Will Ferrel, which again, awful, just bad stupid terrible movie and I don’t know why I watch it when I’m sad but I do and it just brings me comfort every time.

Suddenly realising my commitment issues may be playing into my choice to be agnostic  Oops
A million ways to die in the west
This was an EXACT recreation of the episode of the office where Michael goes alone into the woods to prove he’s a man. Except it was missing an Andrew to play the part of Dwight and follow discreetly behind him, ensuring his safety the whole time…
Garrett…. Um… are you okay? Because…. You don’t seem okay…. I’m actually kind of concerned about your mental state.

My comfort movie is Legend of Hei...i can watch it over and over again... If you guys haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. You could say it's similar to other ghibli films out there...

my comfort movie is the entire pirates of the Caribbean series and the hunger games
I husband now but I still love you.
hey garrett!! rewatching/listening to sweet boys. are you still being captain america for halloween ?!
My comfort videos are YOU Garrett! You make me feel not alone, and like there's someone out there like me. You make me laugh, and I wish I could just give you a hug  But to answer your question: Comfort movies: The Greatest Showman and Arrival! Both remind me of good places in my life, and though I may not be there anymore, it's nice to have something to remember them by <3
my comfort movies are Pretty in Pink and spirited away ;)
What takes months to upload tho❓🤔
Coraline and spirited away!!! I was so happy when he pulled that out.
my comfort movie is probably coraline or some random movie from my childhood, nostalgia and seeing things that i used to enjoy from a different perspective is such an experience. for example, ive binged total drama island and victorious this year and its so different from what i used to make of it.
My comfort movie is definitely " Drop dead Fred "....can't ever go wrong with a classic.  Bad luck tends to come in 3s so things should be looking up very soon. Your ADHD is hilarious ..and super relatable lol
You pulling that baby skeleton legit had me XD  Honestly can't think of a comfort movie but my comfort show to watch is Bob's Burgers.  I watch it every single night while going to bed

My comfort movie is def Clueless or The Blind Side!
It’s stressing me out watching Garrett stumble around with those sandals
“Probably Harry Potter one…and the 7 other films they’ve made”. Mood
comfort films- harry potter, the way he looks, almost any disney, howls moving castle (not a movie but attack on titan season1 and any murder mystery/crime drama show like the bridge or something silly like miss fishers murder mysteries lol)
it's the retrograde, i feel you 😮‍💨
For some odd reason iv only just seen this has been uploaded! But couldn't of come at a better time! Yay
before my comfort movie was Spiderverse, dunno why I always come back to it everytime I cry and breakdown. Now I just don't watch movies at all lol
The Mamma Mia movies are my comfort movies
My comfort movies are Labyrinth, Music and Lyrics, or Pretty Woman. I grew up on Pretty Woman which in retrospect was a bit weird that my mom was like letting her seven year old girl watch an R-rated movie about the things Pretty Woman is about, but like.. I also feel like Pretty Woman has amazing morals about respect and self-worth and not judging people by the position they're in, so I'm glad I had those values impressed upon me early.
My comfort movie is easily Tron: Legacy, so many awesome memories and my favorite thing pretty much ever
Just move to Colorado or Alaska, worked for my brother 💀
I have know watched this 5 times

So happy seeing Garrett emerge back on YouTube with a new video :)  Missing Sweet Boys and these wild videos too!!  (About halfway through the video now so best of luck finding and surviving in a woodsyy place 😁) Edit:   My comfort movie is hard to choose, but I think I would have to choose Studio Ghibli's Howl's Moving Castle   from Hayao Miyazaki

My comfort movie is by far The Prince of Egypt (also any 2000s Barbie movie)
I was originally impressed you had a tent to bring and then I saw the completed product and started praying you wouldn’t actually spend the night in it.  Also I’m a little disappointed you didn’t take the bones with you :( maybe that’s just a me thing.
Is that the KILL BILL SWORD?!
the fact that drew and garett have recently uploaded has cured every problem i have ever had
okay but Garret can sing lol
Why did the falling tree actually make me jump 😂

My comfort movies are Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle..... and Ru Paul's Drag Race :)
Your freezer is frozen. It's blocking airflow into the refrigerator. Take everything out, unplug it, and leave the doors open. It should fix it, at least temporarily, while you order a new one.
My comfort movie is Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse :)
You need grapes my ass buddy .. You need a XANX lmaoo! :) 😂
Hes going crazy
My comfort movies/Tv shows don't match up lol: The Mummy (1999), Howl's Moving Castle, and Stranger things. It's definitely a vibe, a cozy one
So... it's not a movie, but I love watching and re-watching Shameless. There's just something about that show that brings me a lot of comfort.. like bunches and bunches of it.

Omg garret same . 100% 50 first dates is such a safe comfort movie 😂 I wasn’t expecting you to say that one lol!!
ESCAPE FROM LA. OMFGGGGGGGGG
Like, I love you man! And I'm too have an urge to be in nature a lot. But I live by a rural area in my city, and I tend to be indoors most of the time. It's really hot in here! But sometimes when I'm overwhelmed with the human world I totally want to ditch everything in go live by myself in a forest or something. Some weeks ago I found a book about Internal family Systems, a psychotherapy model that understand our mind like a multiplicity of parts, or subpersonalities, if you will. I think you will enjoy learn about that. It's not like DID, but explains it very well.
Love you Garrett!!!!!

As someone who backpacks and forages frequently year round I was very worried for this man's safety the entire video but I couldn't look away

Did someone take a little to much acid ? Lol
The Devil Wears Prada idk why!
What happen to you lol. And are u and Shane friends still.
That would be such a funny horror movie to have someone “escape LA “ into the woods onto someone’s private property and the person who lives on the property is scared of the random man digging holes and setting up his skeletons while the random man is afraid of whoever is living on the property

Happy spooky season to the king of spook!!🎃👑
Garrett Watts is literally my spirit animal
Last Holiday with Queen Latifah. I’ve probably watched it 100 times. Such a great feel good film
Feel like it’s important to mention that this is super unsafe. Being out in the woods with no gear & no idea is dangerous. Please don’t try this at home.
Are we all gonna ignore how Garrett actually looked up 'are lobsters immortal'.. Now I'm curious
My comfort movie is Madea’s Witness Protection. I’ve watched it at least 200 times and know literally every word 🤣🤣 Or literally any Studio Ghibli film ❤️
My comfort movie is midnight in Paris
Aye there is absolutely no shame in having a plushie as an adult!
The fact that Garret thinks he's unattractive despite the fact that several people probably want him to break their backs
The Holiday is a good comfort movie, even though it's kind of seasonal. 😅 And the soundtrack is amazing.
wrote down and learned that brilliant song you did at the end 🤣 love you garrett, keep being your amazing self ♥️   and my comfort movie is LOL because of nostalgia 😅🙄
“I think it’s a pretty effective security measure” Mr. Watts your car got stolen
I'll go with you Garrett, I'll go with you anywhere. Even while you look crazy. Anything is better than than this sheet show world..
Harry Potter, legally blond, American pie, clueless!
Somehow seeing the full outfit is the most unsettling part of this
my favorite comfort movie is frozen 2 !! idk why but i became obsessed with it when it came out
my comfort movies has to be coraline <33 omg I love that movie
My comfort movies are are Legally Blonde, My Cousin Vinny, and 13 going on 30.
You've Got Mail for a movie, Home Improvement for a tv show also when are the sweet boys gonna get back together?
My comfort films: Titanic, the Care Bears Movie and Step Brothers 😃
I can’t stop thinking about that episode of the office where Michael goes into the woods and try’s to survive off the land. 😂
the secret life of walter mitty!
My comfort movies are movies I watched a lot as a kid: Willow, Legend, The 'Burbs, Alice in Wonderland, Neverending Story.
Damnnn Garrett living in the middle of LA has a house and pool that size and new car!?
whats going on with you and shane?
fellow agnostic🥰
Some things you may not think to do/bring but I think are good ideas:   •find out what time sunset is so you can plan your day accordingly  • something that's not a phone, only meant for music, to distract from scary noises (with headphones, they save battery life)   • compass   • thermal clothes AND sleeping bag   • as much water as as you can carry, bubbly celtzer is not a bad idea because its lighter, use 0 calorie ones, nothing sugary that'll make you more thirsty or potentially dehydrated.   • no shame in going back car to sleep (get there before sunset)  • take a walk with everything you're carrying to see how much you can endure. Try to avoid making 2 trips.  • try to be as close to car as possible   • not the worst idea to leave car unlocked if you need to run and get In fast. Relatively unlikely someone would steal it if you're far away from people.   I once tried to drive 4 hours to another state to run away too and only got 45 minutes into it before I got pulled over, the cop treated me the way I wished cops treated everyone. #whitegirlprivilege he showed me where parking lots were, so I chilled there because I was getting tired. I stayed in the lot for maybe 30 minuets before deciding to go back home because there were no hotels open. I didn't really feel failure, I felt more like I made a smarter decision. And you did too.
My comfort movie is the Harry Potter series
Comfort movie: anything pokemon
my comfort movie is national treasure lmaoooooooo
My comfort movies are Spirited Away, Ratatouille, The Dark Crystal and Cinema Paradiso. They all have the most special place in my heart. Spirited Away is my all time favorite, in fact, I just got Haku tattooed on my calf. Ratatouille is so warm and comfy and always cheers me up. Probably my #1 comfort film. Yes it's a film. Ratatouille can't just be a Disney movie, okay? It's an art piece. The Dark Crystal was my most memorable childhood movie. I would watch it like, 14 times in a row. My mother can attest to that. And Cinema Paradiso is a film that I share with my father that I can never let go. It's a beautiful classic filled with bittersweet resolution. I absolutely love them and never get tired of watching them. Love you Garrett, you cheer up my days! Stay pridefully yourself. You have a lovely soul :))))
Over the Garrett’s wall

This man has the biggest 💚!!   Even JS couldn't catch him 😆😂
GARRET YOU DO NOT NEED A CATALYTIC CONVERTER
Garret my fridge also broke but the freezer still worked so we unplugged it and let everything in the freezer melt and it cleared out all the ice stuck in the vent that pumps cold air to the fridge. So the problem might be that your freezer is clogged full of ice so therefore the circulation isn’t reaching the fridge.I hope I explained myself correctly also hope it helps.
My comfort movie is the Cat Returns made by Ghibli ! Probably watched that movie for a hundred times (no exaggeration) XD
My comfort movie is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (as well as The Lost Boys). and honestly I can relate to him saying "i'm fine, I'm doing great" in high pitch voice lol
Please don't trespass when you go out in nature. In most cases restricted access to protect vulnerable species...
I've been binging Mr Ballen videos and I'm concerned Garrett.... None of the stories involving woods are good ones lol
Garrett is a personified representation of the random and wild running thoughts that live rent-free in my head. I enjoy the company.
My comfort movies are the lord of the rings trilogy they remind me of my grandpa and it makes me feel like he’s is still here
Love u Garrett. <3
My comfort movies are fantastic mr fox and legally blonde <3
You’re worried about bear but you forget the mountain lions and bobcats and coyotes Lolol

My comfort movie is Chicken Little; it makes me feel like I’m not always the biggest screw-up of a person and that maybe an alien invasion or other opportunity will come for me to look better
Happy I paused at 11:30 :)
"Kungfu Panda" and "How to Train Your Dragon" are my go to comfort movies. I'm a definite DreamWorks type gal.   P.S. would say Shrek too, but he gets me too excited ;)
My 6 month old baby was CACKLING at this video 😂

I love your energy Garrett!   This video is so relatable, like I want to runaway too! 🤠
My two comfort movies are Brave and Coraline
you got beard 🧔‍♀️
missed you garrett! pro tip: don't leave an actual trail of food like that in the woods because that is the one definitive way a bear WILL find you.  I don't have a comfort movie but my favorite comfort show is breaking bad. its just so well done that i re-watch it about once a year.  p.s. we miss sweetboys, pls come back.
i would watch hours of garrett just going out and exploring things like the abandoned house or the trailer
As a fellow agnostic, I always explain what it is to people by saying "when I die, guess I'll find out!"
i have a really old creepy wizard puppet i keep in my living room for security! i have the same thought process of someone coming in, seeing him, and being like lol nope and going to the next one 😅
He's lost it
Are u related to Chris watts because that would be crazy but I love your videos…
Someone "professionally" stole two Cadillac converters from the  (company I work for)work vans  during the summer

The little flapper door on your fridge probably broke so it can’t get cool air from the freezer. Same thing happened to me last summer. Hope you fix it. (:
You should do stealth camping like Steve Wallis!!!
Just to clarify - agnostic doesn't mean you believe in _everything_ ; it means you admit the afterlife/higher-power is unknowable and/or incomprehensible to our level of thought, so you're sufficed to live a relatively "good" life and think the higher-power, if there is one, will accept that you couldn't have known of them and will accept your relative goodness.  I personally think the idea of praise/worship is very vain/conceited for a deity, which is one of my main qualms with _organized_ religion.
I don't watch comfort movies....I watch comfort drag race and allstars 🤣🤣😅😅 Currently rewatching season 1 of drag race.
Shane uploaded and it made me feel :( but then Garrett posted and I feel :)

My comfort movie has to be The Labyrinth. I LOVE that movie so much. That and the Dark Crystal, and The Never Ending Story (The first one). I can watch them over and over again and they always make me feel good.
Garrett's videos make me so happy, but this video couldn't have came out at a better time for me. I've recently become homeless (sorta kinda by choice, long weird story but whatever) and this video really makes me feel better about my situation and in general lifts my spirits (can't really explain the feeling but), Thank you Garrett, keep the amazing videos coming, love ya!! 💛🖤🎃💀😹
Garrett.. do you want me to actually take you on a wilderness adventure where you like, camp in the wilderness legally and have enough food and water and sleep in a real tent? Because wow, I'm sorry, I love you, but you do not know how to camp 😅

Garrett is my spirit sibling...both from Spokane, love Harry Potter, are hufflepuff, agnostic, believe in ghosts, aliens. Everything but don't know for sure, love creepy stuff and cute stuff.

My comfort movie is empire records!!! Da besttt
OMGGGGGGG 50 first dates is my comfort movie too!!! its a really sweet movie that and mean girls
I don't really have a comfort movie, but 2021 has been the year I fully became K-drama trash, and Hospital Playlist has become my comfort TV show. It's on Netflix and is about these five best friends who are all surgeons in their 40s working in this hospital and they're also in a band and the whole plot is just...their everyday life. Like. It sounds like it would be so boring because it's literally just their daily lives, but that's what makes it so comforting. Also, unlike most shows, there's no Big Bad Person. For the most part, all the characters are just wholesome lovely people.   I dunno. I've been yodeling about this show to anyone who would listen ^_^;;
Oh, Garrett. You bless mine and my husband's day when you upload 😂 My comfort movies are 10 Things I Hate About You or LOTR!
i posted a clip of you screaming in the woods on my snapchat and my dad asked why i was watching a crackhead slowly losing their mind and i thought you'd appreciate that Garrett
My comfort movie is actually Spirited Away!  I was so happy when you brought that out 😄🤗
My comfort movie is Pride and Prejudice… with Kiera Knightley.
My comfort movie is Nacho Libre.

I remember a few years ago hearing of someone pulled over for driving in the carpool lane with a mannequin actually
This man literally bought a jeep for a youtube video
I feel really alone and.. as embarrassing and sad as it is, your videos help me feel less alone. In the past week I had to put my dog down, got dumped, and my car got broken into where they stole my laptop and money.. I really need some help so thanks for being just a little bit of help for me right now..❤
Garret would have so much fun being wicaan or just an agnostic that practices Magick. I wanna make him tea and teach him tarot
I wasn't aware of how much I've missed you until I saw the notification. You're literally doing what I want to do every single day of my life,  gather random stuff and get the hell out of here. Thank you.  WE LOVE YOU GARRETT!!
I’m only 2 minutes in but….. mercury retrograde. Someone had to say it
I'm at 0:26, can I literally abandon my life and come also what forest

I’ve always thought I relate to Garrett but him not wanting to make reservations cuz it’s too complicated really takes the cake
I wrote a comment on your last video asking where you were and here you are!!!! We miss your content, you , and Andrew✌🏼✌🏼✌🏼

howl’ moving castle is my comfort movie for life! (the entire shrek series is #2) i just remember watching howl’s moving castle for the first time as a kid and being completely mesmerized by it and i thought about that movie for YEARS until i learned the name of it. and now i get to share that movie with my kids.❤️
I hate to say this my comfort movies are the Percy Jackson movies and the first and 3rd Harry Potter movies

Agnostic doesnt mean that you believe in everything there is. Agnostic means you can't tell if God is real or not, because you have no proof. It's being ignorant and tolerant at the same time :p
🦕
The mummy and Mulan animated version 🪲
My comfort movie is Rocketman and I may have watched it more times than I can recall :D
"I'll just die and see what happens..lol"    OHHHH GODDD ITS HURTSSS ITS JUST TO RELATABLE
I wonder how Garrett is doing with Shane’s return to youtube
GOD I NEED SOME GRAPES
50 first dates, Harry Potter goblet of fire or anything studio ghibli for me are the most comforting 😁
It always makes me happy when he uploads but this one DOES concern me that younger audiences might decide to go on their own woodland adventure (despite him saying CLEARLY at the end to NOT do this hahaha) not realizing how EASY it is to get lost in certain kinds of woods 😬 So for any kiddos out there, go on adventures but read up on stuff first! Plz. 😆 Mmm comfort movie for me would be....I dont have one 😔
One of my comfort movies is Little Women.
pitch perfect
This SCREAMS Michael Scott running away to the wild

Bo Burnhams Outside: the sequel to inside
You need to see the Mark Twain claymation movie!! It’s called The Adventures of Mark Twain. You. Will LOVE IT! I agree though 50 first dates is a great comfort film!
my comfort movie is the outsiders mainly because we watched it in 7th grade right before the world fell apart and it's attached some good memories.  is that the most 14 year old girl answer? probably.
My comfort movie is Ratatouille but Doctor Who slaps so hard when I’m sad bc I usually don’t have the motivation to choose something else after an hour n a half
My comfort film is literally all the Harry Potter films ❤ currently knitting myself a slytherin scarf and a Harry Potter patch work blanket
Wow, imagine a documentary style video that doesn't take two parts out of three to get to the actual meat of the video. This is not @ing anyone /at all/
“I’ll just die and see what happens…lol”.  I had such a joyful, macabre chuckle at this.  Perfect summation.

i love you bud!!! i'm glad you didn't die alone in the woods
My comfort movies are definitely the new suicide squad and both of the ant man movies :D David Dasmalchian is just *chefs kiss* perfection 😌🤚
garrett, man, that’s how you get killed 😩  okay, comfort movies: Parent Trap and for some reason, Blended. also, i know no one asked but comfort tv shows: the haunting of hill house and, surprisingly, midnight mass!!!
Im a lot older than you, so my comfort movie(s) can be pretty hard to find.  "Baby" its about a dinosaur.  And, "Ratboy" a story of a boy that is a rat.  I also like, "Beaches" with Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey.
One of my top comfort movies is Howls Moving Castle. Its so aesthetically pleasing, very easy to lay down and get lost in the wonderful world of Howls life haha
Omg putting the skeletons outside to scare away animals…except they like bones. Lol I really want to see the Scarebearcrow!
are he and andrew still friends??
when will i do this 😭
my comfort movies: lupin the third: the first (2019) soul luca kill bill (1&2) tangled paddington  (kill bill is so out of place in this list lmao but i love them and thank you garrett for expressing your love for the movies cuz it made me check them out)
I think I'd have felt way more comfortable watching this if you just took Andrew with you 😅
Garrett Walden Watts
I absolutely love these type of vids
I always forget just how chaotic this man is, o my god. But honestly if I could bring one person to a forest with no way to get out, Garrett it is. I can bring the necessesesesery survival stuff, he brings the will to live!
idiocracy or super troopers. i will ALWAYS watch them if given a choice we love you Garrett!
I want to be his assistant and help him figure out the shenanigans he comes up with. I want to devote my life to that task.
GARRETT!! You're stellar wicked awesome! You most certainly did not look bad watt-so-ever, heh heh, eh? Watt sooo...But seriously! You're devastatingly handsome always.  Love this video it really looked spooky 👻 and always love skeletons! I think bathroom spider fella had the sweetest burial 😍 It would be pretty rad if you were interested in doing a video in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, home of the Crescent Hotel 💀 super kooky town with a ton of diverse interesting peeps ☺  also...endless bounds of cool insects! We also used to have Humpty Dumpty sitting on the wall but an evil witch came along and destroyed him once and for all. Very sad. So I went home and watched Harry Potter and Wedding Singer! Cheers me up as those are some of my favorite comfort movies 🎬! I look forward to your next video and will keep watching the schweet content you have out! Things will look up for you soon before you know it 😊 Peace and love my friend!
Garrett your beard is amazing
Your videos actually make me so happy, every time you upload I go down a rabbit hole and watch every video you have ever uploaded
Thank you Garrett for an awesome video, my comfort movie is Tommy Boy. It always makes me laugh and gets my mood up. 🤣 Love ya bro!
My comfort movie is either 500 days of summer or inception 😂❤️ depends on the mood
My comfort movie is Texas Chainsaw Massacre! Which is probably a red flag honestly but here we are anyway :D
my comfort movie is probably the muppets (2011) I could probably recite the entire movie from memory by now
My comfort movie is Bratz: Rock Angelz. Idk, it's very good 🤗
Clueless is my comfort movie, even growing up as a tomboy, it was fun to watch with my mum
I worry about Garrett sometimes.
Fox and the Hound, Sweeney Todd, or Moulin Rouge are my comfort movies. It’s nice to have a pick me up after dealing with family issues, and watching your new video. Next time bring blankets, jackets, firewood, or something to help you start a fire so you don’t freeze lol. In the mountains a compass, MRE, water, and fire fuel are important.
Comfort movie is The Cat returns 😅 Watch it everytime I'm sick or feel like shit 😂❤
My comfort movies are Corpse Bride and 500 days of Summer
We are literally witnessing Garret go through mercury retrograde.
My comfort movie is always legally blonde and 40 year old virgin
Garrett, I have so many movies that bring my copious amounts of comfort. But I when I’m seriously depressed or lonely, I actually find myself watching YouTube. For a couple years now I’ve been watching YouTube videos from 2016. I watch A LOT of markipliers old videos, Ryan higas parkhourse videos, and ldshadowlady’s shadow craft single player series. Do you watch YouTube videos from ages ago?
Goes to the woods. calls the woodsy ground "the floor" lol love u GURRET
New bigfoot footage!!! He does a Bo Burnham Inside by the end too!!!
‘Terrible’ certainly wasn’t the first thing that popped into mind regarding this rugged, hairy appearance 🙊
Don't question it but my comfort movie is The Conjuring, specifically the first one, so if that says anything about me as a person 😊😎
Weirdly my comfort movie is Anastasia 🤣 I'm sure I watched it almost everyday after school or at least once every weekend as a kid 🤣
My comfort movie is Just Friends
I have so so so many comfort movies but I would say top 3 are ratatouille, Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban, and Harry Potter and the goblet of fire. no shame at all
Garrett looks like a lumberjack.
Trolls world tour is my fav
Love the new place. Congrate Garrett!!!
My comfort movie is the first mummy. I always watched that movie when I was sick on my grandmas tiny vhs tv like the size of my laptop today.
My Comfort movie is one direction this is us or the outsiders ps garret I love your videos
I LOVE THIS VIDEO AND HIS EDITING STYLE!!!!
Love you Garrett
saved this video for a day i could relax (: happy to see it! And my comfort movie is Batman Begins! Watched it countless of times and for me the character through the comics, games and Nolan movies has always held a message that I value. That movie does a really good job of conveying it. (the soundtrack also SLAPS)
I alternate my comfort movie between Mean Girls and any of the classic RomComs - Legally Blond, He's Just Not That Into You, Ghosts of My Girlfriends Past, How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days, Devil Wears Prada.. love them all :D
THINGS! There's a thing for you.
Hey so if u wanna come to Indiana. Got chu
This made me so anxious lol just driving into seclusion without a phone and then the thought of not being able to find the car 🥴
my comfort movie is a silent voice "i want you to help me live" gets me everytime, makes me feel warm and have hope that people can change and that love is real and its okay to live.
The look is giving beast titan vibes
My comfort movie is The Last Unicorn.
Mercury retrograde really got the best of all of us
ok but why was his car song sung so beautifully?? lol also this video was the highlight of my week and my comfort movie is for sure Moonstruck (1987) with Cher and Nicolas Cage!
Grabs a bunch of useless stuff for the trip and spends ~10 minutes on it. At the very end "oh yeah I also bought a whole new car for the trip but like that's whatever"
two of my favorite comfort movies are captain america: the winter soldier and scream. i know its weird and i honestly cannot explain either of them but i like them and theyre my go to when i just need something
thats official. it's a bones day
loving garrett being afraid of bears but also leaving a trail of food on the ground hahaha
My comfort movie is the 3rd Harry Potter movie❤️ I am able to say all the lines with the actors😂
Did anyone see the light go behind him at 24:53?
this is my current mood
mercury retrograde really messed with garret
You look like an actual homeless person 🤣
Ooh also The Hunger Games lol
Honestly 50 First Dates is definitely one of my comfort movies, but also White Chicks lol. I don’t often rewatch movies, mostly shows
It's deer season lol the gun shot was a hunter 🤣
13:19 garrett high off whip cream
This is prob the best horror edit I’ve ever seen, also Comfort movie- Thor ragnorak
Comfort movie: Harry Potter 1 and 2…. And 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and 7 and 8
there's something about those penguins who just go with the flow in the movie surfs up that makes it comfortable to watch🐧
My comfort movie is Clueless or Prisoner of Azkaban
Garrett, I know you’re a grown ass man and are 6 feet something tall but please be careful because you’re just a child at heart. So be safe💚
I’m loving the beard tbh 😊
Goonies
loe ya garrett
My comfort movies are Coraline, It, and Pirates of the Caribbean… they’re all random… and Coraline and It don’t seem like they wolf be a comfort movie… but they just are🤣🖤 love u Garrett
My comfort movies are A Beautiful Mind and Girl Interrupted
i absolutely adore Garrett so much to the point that it actually hurts. my comfort movie is definitely clueless and harry potter (specifically the third one <3)
Anyone else get Over the Garden Wall vibes from this? Especially Greg vibes :>. But also the blair witch project vibes? 0-0
my comfort video is the movie Crybaby with Johnny depp or Too Wong Foo. if you haven't seen both watch them now
My comfort movie is Moonstruck or My Neighbor Totoro, depending on why I need the comfort.
Garrett just running into the definitely not protected and or privately owned woods with barely any survival equipment is actually kind of scary. Glad he’s safe!    Also my comfort movie is Coraline
My comfort movies are Luca and Meet the robinsons. Luca because the color pallet and vibrancy makes me really happy, and the robinsons because its my favorite childhood movie and ive seen it sooo many times
very weird but my comfort movie is ready or not because i love adam brody and samira wiley so much and also i’ve watched it like 12 times before bed to help me go to sleep and i still laugh watching it
Anastasia and the Labyrinth
What if you were camping out here and just hear Garrett laughing maniacally from afar
garret it's just mercury retrograde, it messes with technology. luv u
Garrett is the definition of laughing through pain
I wanna experienced living in the woods/forest🥺
I love watching the hot chick...or ms. Doubtfire😂😂😂
my comfort movie is bolt tbh- its so nostalgic
50 First dates and Coco are my top crying movies…like I’ve never cried at a film more. I think Brother Bear for me.
napoleon dynamite ultimate comfort movie... the opening credits alone pls how can u not. love u loved the vid happy u r safe w taco bell
Blessed Garret’s beard <3
That is SO weird that you asked about comfort movies because I just needed to watch my comfort movies last night when I was in a bad place! My comfort movies are the Hallmark version of Alice in Wonderland, and the first Twilight movie!
my comfort movie is The Perks Of Being A Wallflower it makes me cry every time i watch it and i love it with all my heart
My comfort movie is Queen and Slim
The Burbs is my comfort movie lol
My comfort movie especially if it is raining is The Goonies. I also find myself enjoying Matilda as a comfort movie too. Those two have always been my favorite throughout my entire life.
mine is a silent voice :(
school of rock is my comfort movie and i have the entire soundtrack memorized. a true modern classic if nothing else
I feel like we need an adventures with Garrett and Andrew series! I'd watch every episode💛
I watched Last Unicorn as a comfort movie recently, can never go wrong with it :)
my comfort movie is que culpa tiene el niño, it is a 10/10 please see it, its in spanish tho but you can just put subtitles :) ily!
My comfort movie is definitely Kiki’s delivery service :)  (Btw I’m glad you’re safe Garrett lol)
whys no one talking about the bonessss
Thats crazy I just went and stayed with a friend in Yosemite in a tent. ‘Twas very cold, i slept in a raccoon onsie. I have pics. But yeah my favorite comfort movie, prob Moana. Also just watched Rocky horror picture show for the first time in my life..
ok 2 things: 1) the singing towards the end made me think of bo burnham 2) all of the subtle harry potter references made me so happy i love it 🥰 so grateful for this upload garrett! <3
Garrett videos always make me feel like i'm watching a grown-up version of blue's clues :)
my comfort movie is the social network
my comfort movie is fried green tomatoes. it’s based on a book but i only knew the movie as a kid. i watched it on vhs all the time i think just as something my parents put on to keep us occupied, but it gives me nostalgic feelings now because of that .   probably shouldn’t have been watching it as a kid either, because it’s set in 1920s alabama with lesbian feminists who fight wife beaters and kkk members. involves a lot of heavy and introspective themes of navigating yourself and the world when it seems awful and it’s just all around so sweet. kinda sad and a bit on the “harder to watch” side at times because of the more extreme topics, but it’s overall so lovely! i read the book and it’s sequel now as an adult and it made me love it even more, i got a tattoo of a honey jar to represent it (makes sense if you watch it… wink wink) hugely recommend to anyone ❤️
Encino man,  the hobbit, beauty and the beast
Just imagine Garret having an awesome fight scene with a bear
Awwww Garrett !! oh how I’ve missed you 😊😊😊 So glad u didn’t die in the woods and decided to join us back in the modern world !! OH! And my comfort movie is Wayne’s World . Party on my friend 🤘🏼
So chaotic! I love it!!!
I do see you 😌🤟🏻
TANGALD IS MY FAV OMG
There’s something magical about this
Care Bears in wonderland is my comfort movie or the first season of Lost.
my comfort movie is Coraline! I know that probably sounds weird but i think even the creepy parts are so beautiful. I could watch that movie a million times and feel the same calm wash over me and a love for all the unique wonders of the world and imagination.
oh, Garrett. Mercury really was in retrograde for you 😂 hopefully it gets better after today!! 💖
Was it a conscious choice picking Hermione’s wand for the woods? Yes, she would help us survive lmao
I have  a few comfort movies, just depends on what I'm in the mood for but it's always something from the MCU or What We Do In The Shadows
Mine is Toy Story for sure. More specifically 1or 2. I'll never forget the day I lost my toy Jessie's hat...the end of my world
Would a hiker get freaked out if u accidenlty left a skeleton in the woods🤣💀
Garret in the woods is just me everyday with my newborn 😂☺️
Weird. I was eating frozen berries when he said that. They were thawed though
YES! I would say Harry potter 1-8!!😃 love your videos Garrett! How are you doing btw!
ngl, my comfort movie is your channel because I've been watching your videos for a long time and whenever things get hard i rewatch them cause you always make me laugh so if things ever get hard for you or you feel bad just remember that you make a lot of sad ppl happy just by being you <33
all of the cinderella stories are always comforting
My comfort movie is probably Buffalo Soldiers with Joaquin Phoenix 💀
I think my comfort movie is how to train your dragon, any Harry Potter movie, or zootopia lmao
Fun fact my friend killed a man with a sword just like that
I can’t think of any comfort movies (even though I definitely have a few) but my favorite comfort show is Friends! I also just wanted to say thank you for reading all comments even if they don’t have any likes. You replied to one of my comments once and it absolutely made my day/month/year!
For someone who was absolutely terrified of a bear encounter you did one of the absolute worst things you could possibly do by having food near you let alone a trail of it on the ground. Please nobody ever do this. I also highly do not recommend camping on private property especially if you hear gun shots in the background.
my comfort movie is little women (2019). i can never get tired of it :)
I love stand by me ! The movie has meaning and I love that !
not me holding my adult Perry the platypus teddy so excited that I'm not the only one. I've never felt so seen. thank you for being you lovely
Looks like the retrograde has gotten even the best of us 🥺
I really wish I could find a guy like Garrett! Also love your vids!
Garrett, I love that you ask questions like that because it really gets me thinking. I definitely have a few! Any of the Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit films FOR SURE, but I also love the films O Brother Where Art Thou and Moonstruck. Any of those films just give me a warm comforting feeling on days where I don’t feel like myself💕
My comfort movie is Kung Fu Panda any of them
Your great Garret! !love you! !♡♡
garretts gonna get stabbed by a homeless man
mercury retrograde

Garrett saying he has a detective friend is literally the most Garrett thing in this video

Garrett really lived out my dreams in this one - thanks for taking us along on your escape, we needed it too
How is Garrett not dead yet?
i can't wait for another three months for another video :)
My comfort movie is definitely Mulan (the original). I think it’s because one time, when I was a kid, my sister showed me a video of a “real” beached mermaid and I got really freaked out so I watched mulan twice because it was playing on the channel two times in a row.
My favourite comfort movies are the 2000s to early 2010s barbie movies! I have every single one of them on DVD! They were my whole childhood and make me explode with nostalgia everytime I watch them! 😊❤
You look great bud, no worries! Thanks for posting. I have been so patient!
mines school of rock :D
14:37 “Here listen just take a cookie….GATCHA BITCH” Just cracks me up lmfao
A comfort movie for me is the muppets movie
Sweet boys?
I love going on these super chaotic adventures with you!! I can’t believe you stayed out there for that long by yourself! Woods at night are too spooky for me 👀  I’d have to say one of my comfort movies is Ratatouille… something about the lighting and music is so calming to me 🥰 thanks for sharing and hope you’re doing well!
My comfort movie is Fern Gully 🧡
garett is the meaning of chaotic good
comfort movie: harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban. everything about it. perfection

Garret I think you should try playing a video game called  Don't starve together , I think you would like it !   And It would be a great idea for a video !  You kinda looks like one of the character Woodie from the game.
Damn this Blair witch reboot looks sick :o
that tent scene in the dark was straight out of a horror movie
Yall ever heard of a manic episode?
My comfort movie is Coraline! 50 first dates is incredibly good though adam Sandler hit it out of the park
my comfort movies are the wedding singer, napoleon dynamite, and et
Oh Garrett, why the low energy? 😂 ~ I don’t understand why you didn’t feature the cop more prominently because your video CLEARLY indicated an unmistakable mutual attraction 💟. Anyhoo, at the end, you said, “Send me anything.” My grizzly, dirty, blood-spattered friend, a while ago, I sent a picture of a cute kitten to you and your reply was: “Um. Okay.”  Dahhling, that hurt. NOW you say to send you ANYTHING but you’re a big-shot camper with your own house and car and a Benjamin and a dead spider in a deluxe casket so KEEP your “Send me anythings” —no more cute kittens for you 😿🎭😥🙁. Got it? GOOD! “Um. Okay.” byeeee.
My comfort movie has been Little Monsters since I was a kid, a truly ICONIC movie 👏🏼
04:13, not Garrett calling me out while I'm watching this and actually eating frozen berries.
My comfort movie has to be how to train your dragon (the first one) or legally blonde.
My comfort movies (impossible to choose one) are Night of the Living Dead, The Devonsville Terror, The Lost Boys, and Idle Hands
Coraline
not to be *that* person but... mercury really was on retrograde 😐
My comfort films are mainly the animated (2d disney movies) Tarzan, little mermaid, treasure planet, Atlantis. I’d also say the princess bride or any of the lord of the rings trilogy or hobbit films
My comfort film that I will watch all the time that just brings me joy is Back To The Future. If you couldn't tell already by my avatar. I watch it at least once a month. I will watch it on cable. My friend and I watch it every year at the outdoor cinema. I find comfort in knowing the jokes, being able to quote the movie, knowing that it will always end happily. I just love it.
"The woman who cuts my hair talks shit about her kids and I think that's funny" I legit laughed so hard it annoyed my cat.
Kiki’s Delivery Service or the cat in the hat live action. I love them so much
My comfront movie is curious George ( yes the monkey )
oh god chris mccandless please don't eat any plants you don't know
My favorite comfort movie is practical magic, because Sandra bullock
I was laughing so hard I cried during the spider scene… bro!
My comfort movie would be all Pixar movies, Twilight Saga, and Safe Haven. I watch them as if it was my first time watching them literally with same excitement on every interesting scenes...
Garrett made my day 😭 i needed those laughs. And my comfort movies are Harry Potter and Uptown Girls 🤣
My comfort movie is either Howls Moving Castle or Pirates of the Caribbean. A tie.
This may sound weird but Coraline is my comfort movie! <3 Ive seen it a million times and it just relaxes me.
my comfort movie is ~Fantastic Mr. Fox~ is just so nice.

Yall think this is happening because of a the haunted places he's gone to and mocked 😳 Or it's just y'know bad luck
Please say they’ll be more haunted house/asylum vids 😩
Don’t worry Garrett! Retrograde is finally over 🤌🏻🖤
My comfort movies are Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban or any Studio Ghibli film.  My comfort TV show is always Pride and Prejudice (1995 BBC version).   ps. I love all of your videos!! I always feel that I can relate to them as I'm also a night owl/procrastinator/collector of random things that I find EXTREMELY cool ( but apparently no one else does (╥_╥) ). Always makes my day when you bring out a new video!! <3
my comfort movie would have to be Last Holliday w/ Queen Latifah
hilarious garret runs away and ends up in my backyard, poor city boyo
Comfort movie? The whole LOTR series or Harry Potter. All of them.
My comfort movie is either Chitty Chitty Bang Bang or  the Paddington movies
As a person who travels and lives in a van, this video made me happy and gave me anxiety at the same time.  Also my comfort movie is either Deadpool 2 or Spider-Man Far From Home.
MY COMFORT MOVIE IS THE LABYRINTH ugh I could watch that every single day and it would not get old to be 💜 that or Harry Potter 1, I agree🤣
Garrett!! I paused during your Google search and I think you could totally pull off the RV life.
garrett is like the sweet nugget you find at a rave festival who gives everyone hugs but doesnt smell like BO
Solid movie choice. Also, is anyone else having an issue with "accountants" replying to all of your comments on Garrett's videos and only Garrett's videos? More power to ya, but I'm not your target audience.
For the comfort movie question, mine has got to be Jim Henson's Labyrinth with David Bowie. That movie is so weird and like... kitsch? Idk how to describe it, camp? I mean David Bowie is wearing TIGHTS the entire way through (also he's the goblin king nbd), it's lowkey a musical about a magical goblin world, idk I can't explain it but the movie makes very little sense in the best way possible. I watch it every Halloween cause I scare VERY easily and halloween movies are too much for me, but I am amazed everytime. It's just so whimsical, I love it.
My comfort movies are Disney’s Hercules & I Am Sam
R.I.P bathroom spider
A bear scarecrow?  You mean, a bearcrow?  I'm leaving now

Peter Pan (2003) is my ultimate comfort movie
Lots of comfort movies but the first to come to mind was The Lego Batman Movie (go figure)
My comfort movie is either Ponyo or Howls Moving Castle, they have been such a huge part of my life since as long as I can remember, also I wanna say that I truly appreciate every single video you make, these little moments make me so happy even though they don’t happen often, I hope for some good luck for you because you only deserve the best. You are just a kind soul and i love you (in a platonic normal friend/family way) make sure to stay safe :)

Ya know, without his haircut, Garrett is kind of giving me obi-Wan Kenobi vibes
Wow Garrett really speaks in quotes😍
my #1 comfort movie is pixar’s “SOUL” !! oh my god i swear i learned so much from that movie and i watched it because you talked about it on the podcast garrett!! thank you so much :)
Loving how you can always find new adventures.  My favorite comfort movie is Fried Green Tomatoes and Steel Magnolias.
I have so many comfort movies. Coralie, the nightmare before Christmas, meet the Robinsons, I could go on. So glad to see your face again Garrett💚💚
My comfort movies are Peter Pan, 500 Days of Summer, and Guardians of the Galaxy!
50 first dates is hands down one of the best movies ever made Garrett, I am so happy it makes you just as happy as it makes me.... forgetful Lucy, her lips are so damn juicy, how bout another first kiss. 💋
Even when he reads an ad I’m interested! :) so glad he posted again!
edward scissors hands, i love it. can’t explain lol
Love the look 🖤
the Google search of him trying to find the kids pop version of DNA by Kendrick Lamar is the highlight of this whole video  😂
My comfort movie is either perks of being a wallflower or flipped
You’re literally so lucky that no one shot you 😂😭
my comfort movie is Penelope or Robin Hood Men in Tights
mercury retrograde
Garrett...... literally a total of _zero_ guys were thinking you look bad. I mean, eventually you'll have to face it: you are attractive. Want me to go into the woods with you, look hairy af and live a vegan-ish life? I'm in.
My comfort movie is Ever After. It just manages to cheer me up every time I watch it.
I too also just had to replace my fridge for that exact reason. It took a literal month to replace because literally every time the delivery guys would show up, something would go ary and they would take the replacement fridge with them. It was awful. Honestly moving probably would've been easier, I don't even blame you.
Love you and your video's! ❤
I really appreciate your yearly updates
Imagine being the cop who pulls up to see Garrett with 8foot skeleton baby Ben and a mini cinimon broom in the woods.... With a shovel. 18min mark lol 😂 got it
My comfort movie is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban✨
My comfort movie is eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
Garrett reminds me of Mr.Merlin from Shrek in the best way possible 🦝💗

My comfort movie has to be Labyrinth with David Bowie

i consider the 1990-1993 live action teenage mutant ninja turtles trilogy a great comfort to me, personally
ive been told this is a dumb movie to be my favorite, but aristocats is my favorite of all time. cuz who doesnt like sweet singing cats (minus the whole racist bit)
I really appreciate the realness of "lol I'll bring a bunch of random shit" and doesn't secretly bring actual camping gear. This is why I love Garrett! I have a few comfort films, It kinda depends on what kind of comfort I need.... The Princess Bride, Blair Witch Project, The Shining, A League of Their Own...  ya know... normal shit
I swear garrett in this video gives off friendly werewolf vibes, and the whole 'fighting the urge to run off into the forest and go primal' thing fits that vibe so well
*cough*
my comfort movie is rapunzel😭😂 oh and also coco🥺 lets just say i love disney lmao
I literally jump when he said tree falls.  🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ you got me lol 🤣🤣
Comfort movie would definitely be Secret Life of Walter Mitty. If we’re talking about shows tho, Over the Garden Wall
the cookie trail could very well absolutely lead a bear right to garrett 😬 good thing he has a skeleton bear scarecrow for protection 😤
I 100% agree!! My comfort movies are 50 First Dates and the animated Beauty and the Beast <3
Garrett: I’m gonna have an existential crisis adventure, wanna come with?   Yes, Garrett…be right there! 💕

My comfort movie is elf or chicken little to be honest. I used to watch them with my family or on road trips so there’s happy memories associated with them. :)
My comfort movie probably would be Lilo and Stitch and Howls Moving Castle
Can you please move to Colorado to be apart of Shane’s ghost hunt lol 💗

The Lorax (the newer one) is definately one of my comfort movies. I could not honestly tell you how many times I have watched it, I just know it's alot.
My comfort movie is called How To Be and it's a 2008 Robert Pattinson movie that is so dumb but so good. I used to watch it every night as I went to sleep.
My comfort movie is definitely marmaduke lmao
this is like that one epiode of the office
my comfort movie is the muppets (2011)
my comfort movie(s) are 100% any studio ghibli movie. they helped me through a really tough time of toxic friends and figuring myself out and now im happier than ever (most of that is also thanks you you of course).

I can't pick one but my only non-animated comfort film is Star Trek 2009. Because it introduced me to star trek and I love the coming together aspect and Leonard Nimoy. My other comfort movie might be the first two seasons of Fairy Tail which is both animated and not a movie but boy have I re-watched those like 3 times. Also how to train your dragon and maybe rise of the guardians and maybe coco. I love animation man  Kudos on not dying!

Land before time <3
I have many comfort movies, but the usual ones I turn to are Moana, Harry Potter 4 (GoF) and The Cabin in the Woods. All three of those movies trigger such heavy emotional reactions from me that whenever I'm feeling stressed, I can turn to them to unload some of my emotional burden and leave at the end of the movie feeling significantly lighter.
Garrett you are the only reason Im on YouTube anymore.🖤 My comfort movie is  "To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar."
I love benny and joon, ever since I was a little kid
my comfort movies are trolls 1 and i love you man teehee
Would take more planning, but you could try to section (or through) hike the Pacific Crest Trail (or the Appalachian Trail). I think it could tap into that desire for spirituality, a different form of community, and re-contextualizing humanity's position in the natural world.
Warm Bodies and Pride and Prejudice.
Holiday for the ultimate comfort movie. I think I've seen it like a hundred times by now. Hopefully I'll get comforted one day.
Looks like Garrett got a new car. Looks really good. Car tour?
The movie Catch Me If You Can with my man Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks is by far my number one comfort movie. I can’t explain why either
My comfort movie is Hamlet 2 lol
We all need a garrett in our lives...he's so sweet and wholesome ❤

My comfort movie is like any Pixar movie. Maybe Monsters inc or toy story :)
Comfort movie?? Lego Batman, or Into the spiderverse. I always feel better after watching either of those.
I have a few comfort movies. But one of them is the Street Fighter 2 animated movie. It's super cheesy. But it's still cool and fun and I love it. Used to watch it on the Street Fighter Anniversary Edition PS2 disc as a kid. ❤️
My Comfort movie is the early 2000s Phantom of the opera. I cry watch that movie in the middle of the night!

Omg I literally thought that was a joke tent and Garrett was going to pan to a bigger tent 🤭😅
My comfort movies are all 3 of the IT movies :]
Garett slowly falling into transcendentalism
Your Prius probably never works Bc you probably never did the maintenance on it. 🤷‍♀️
Always happy to see your content & literally relate to pretty much everything you say lol, especially the agnostic bit. Follow your intuition bud. I live rurally & love it. It’s a bit more monthly for my apt but it’s much more worth it. Beautiful scenery & people.  Edit: Comfort movie is lion king or narnia.

I come back to Garrett every now and then and I’ll tell you serotonin is very high and I get very excited ☺️ My favorite comfort movie has to be probably ANY Ghibli movie ever LOL but if I were to pick one it would be When Marnie Was There or Ponyo :)
My favorite comfort movie is Clue. Fun, funny, and every time I watch it I want to have a fancy murder mystery party. Also, the amount of times I’ve hopped in my car and just driven away on a mania-fueled life reset only to realize I have in no way, shape, or form prepared properly is staggering.
What was that?
this is why bo burnham stayed inside
My comfort movie is the Sound of Music! ♥️

i hate that i’m sitting here thinking about how hot he looks and then he precedes to say he looks awful

I think you should move to Canada. Lots of woods, and people often give away those old mobile homes because it's too costly to Reno lol
My comfort movie is Anastasia! This movie has been my favorite since I was a toddler and this movie always on my mind. Because of this movie I want several tattoos based on it and I especially really want my wedding dress to resemble Anya’s coronation gown 🥺 I will never not think about this movie

Imagine being a random hiker, minding your own business, and coming across a tall man who needs a hair cut and a shave, in a child’s tent, with a couple of skeletons digging a hole in the woods at night. Garrett you’re actually someone’s nightmare right now.
My comfort movie is definitely Pretty Woman. It really helps my anxiety! 🥺❤️
My comfort movie is Burlesque or But I’m A Cheerleader. Two very different movies but they can solve 90% of my emotional problems.

Always such a joy to watch you Garrett. You never fail to make me smile and laugh till my face and lungs ache. My comfort movies are; High Spirits, Queen of the Damned and Legion. What can i say? My tastes run a bit on the darker side. Lmao
My comfort movie is either the maze runner or Thor ragnarok. They make me happier then they probably should.
my comfort movie is mamma mia because meryl streep is pure talent in human form and it was the first CD I ever memorized. my mom and i would put it on every road trip so it makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside :)))
I'm sorrry but is THAT what the ground looks like in these areas? 19:34 Holy crap no wonder those wildfires are unstoppable, a boy scout could not have made a better base for a campfire. Anyway hope you don't get eaten by a bear, Garret <3
Everyone seems to be ignoring the fact that Garrett is so f*cking attractive with a beard
My comfort movie is Sabrina (the 1995 version with Harrison Ford). It makes me so happy
“BUTTERKNIFE! GOTCHYA BITCH”
Killer Klowns from Outer Space. Absolute favorite, one of my best friends even bought me a costume

My comfort movie is The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Soooo fucking good and highly under-acknowledged.
Comfort movie is Tangled. No matter my mood, Tangled makes me happy! And MLP TV show. I'm very much a child in adult form 😂
THE “TREE FALLING” LITERALLY MADE ME JUMP LOL
Anyone else thinking that maybe something followed Garrett back from that haunted hospital??? Just noticed that all those strange misfortunes happened after the investigation at the hospital and I remember back when Ghost Adventures went there, the crew later said they felt as if something followed them back as well because a strange string of just odd misfortunes started to happen.
Did I imagine that there was a house tour last week and it is now gone?
Omg lol the tree animation falling around 20:28 on you made me jump and scared for a second 😂
my comfort movie is shutter island i fall asleep to it jheheh
I’m sorry but I love this 27:09

Catalytic converters are used to make drugs.
Hai Garrett!!:3 I’m always so happy to see you upload you make my day better but my comfort movie would have to be knives out / hairspray (2007) / rocky horror picture show and especially divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood ( bc my nene loved that one) I could literally watch those over and over and never get bored .
You can still typically drive without a catalytic convertor. Legally because of emission laws, I'm not sure.
GARRETTTT ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I knew you would be back, it’s spooky season 👻
twilight is my comfort movie lol
that was the funniest explanation of agnostic I've ever heard. "I'm just gonna die and see what happens." LMFAO!
The whole I'm quirky, I do weird things, I have small figurines is great, but I'd love to see a more honest video. With ❤

My comfort movie is probably Matilda. Hear me out. I know the beginning by far is pretty shitty but don’t you feel so warm and fuzzy when Matilda gets adopted by Ms. Honey?? I die! I love it 🥰

50 first dates is my comfort movie.. there was a point in my life when I watched it everyday. As soon as you asked this movie came to mind and I was shocked you said the same. I almost choked on my cake!
Garrets erratic behavior brings me such comfort.
🤍
Not a comfort movie, but for some reason I'm very comforted by rewatching 1000lb sisters lol
My comfort movie is probably Pitch Perfect 3, at least for the moment. I’ve been watching it nearly daily for a month, like the stable person that I am and it makes me feel very at home and nice
I didn’t know I needed this video!! I feel u Garrett, idk what I’m doing most of the time but I gotta just keep going anyway. This video was so wholesome omfg💞
My confort films are the monster house and barbie's diary
Any film with Meg Ryan is a comfort film to me, what a babe
A bear scarecrow. Would you say a.... bearcrow?
I think Garrett was a court jester in another life time.  Plus elf.
Are you ok Garrett?
Coraline! I love that movie with all my heart! I’ll watch it on repeat.
i love how garrett’s priority was burying a spider from his bathroom instead of bringing actual helpful supplies on his getaway lmao
If you have been also watching Mr. Ballen's video about people going in the woods... 👀👀
Comfort movies. Leap year.  Ps I love you. And letters to Juliet.   I'm leaving out harry Potter because those are a given. #hufflepuffpride

my comfort movie is ✨shrek✨
every second of this video gave me the urge to call for Andrew's help AND I DONT EVEN HAVE HIS PHONE NUMBER
Honestly though Garrett’s content always puts me in a good mood.
MINE IS TANGLED OMG THAT MOVIE IS SO GOOD
The Peanuts movies are my comfort movies, they’re so nostalgic and warm
the mummy series lol (not the new one with tom cruise of course) so I rly appreciated the reference in this video
Garrett you look great! Like here right, are you a little unkept? Sure. But you know who else is/was? Bo Burnham in Inside. And I think we all know that man is FINE. Therefore you are FINE. That is all, thank you for attending my Ted Talk.
Garrett may take week or months long breaks but when he uploads his videos are great
Mine is Back to the Future
🖤
What is the sweet boys update?!!!
Too bad Bigfoot didn't make an appearance. I think that if anyone can branch the divide between humans and Bigfoot it's Garrett.
Definitely Harry Potter or Charlie's Angels 🥰
Mercury retrograde got you too huh?
how are you even funnier and more entertaining than I remember 😂💕
I have many comfort movies, but I HAVE to say The Devil Wears Prada. It's just SO good and nice to watch. (Hate the boyfriend tho)
Loved the video! My top comfort movies are Matilda, Saving Mr. Banks, Anastasia, and Inside Out, but I also love Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings!
this video was extremely helpfully omfg i'm heeding the heck out of that ending  ps my ultimate comfort movie is probably avengers assemble, but barbie island princess, indiana jones, spongebob, sweeney todd, star trek, and the shawshank redemption are also strong but strange contenders.
idk, to be MIA for months and come back with this content?? and the past ones as well, it just seems very predictive at this point and not creative. BUT thats his content and he can do what he wants.
My comfort movie is Matilda! Also mean girls haha
One of my comfort movies is definitely Corpse Bride !! For the spooky vibes and other obvious reasons lol (victor is hot)
i didn't get a notification... weird...
Only 5 minutes in and totally relatable.. continuing to watch to help convince me not to run away into the forest
I'm doing FINE.
MERCURY RETROGRADE
my comfort movie is Sailor Moon Eternal Pt2, The Tale of Princess Kaguya, Kiki's delivery service, Perfect Blue, and Breakfeast club. I have a lot and i cannot pick just one

"Get lost, bat!" got me cracking up.
Garrett could be the next Joe Robinet...  dunno, I'm just here for the pretty colors.  Rock on Garrett!
The enchanted forest is calling you Garett
When you said comfort movie my head instantly went to 50 First Dates. I watched that movie so much when it came out. My friends would get so annoyed because I would always put it on when we hung out, that or Napoleon Dynamite.
27:53 Garrett sounds like he was supposed to be alive during the 60's. I'd say my comfort movie is Forrest Gump. It happens to be my favourite movie. I also like to put on Girl, Interrupted, just to have it on. Practical Magic is another one.
Okay one of my comfy movies is Pretty Woman. I like how everything looks and I love Julia Robertson.
Yo benjamin scared the crap out of me when you flashed your light on the camp sight
I know that saying the entire Harry Potter series is kind of cliche because of who I'm "talking" to, but I assure you that I'm currently wearing my custom made Hufflepuff inspired shirt (made by friends) and wearing my Hufflepuff hoodie.  So my answer is of course, the entire Harry Potter series.
Imagine running into garret in the woods.. you’d see a man with a hook, rope, sword and creepy baby.. I’d be terrified! Lol My two comfort movies are The Wedding Singer, and Rock-a-Doodle! My Grammy always used to put on Rock-a-Doodle when I was sick.. ☺️
My comfort movie has to be scott pilgrim vs the world
My comfort movies are Jurassic park and Alien......much comfort.
My comfort movie is coraline :)
PHASE 2?! but my comfort movies have to be Nick and Nora's Infinate Playlist, End game and He's Just Not That Into You.
I would love for Garrett to do more abandon exploring
My comfort movie is "Cold Brook" with William Fichtner and Kim Coates 😁
Comfort movie: The Holiday with Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, Kate Winslet and Jack Black.
Plot twist: He unalived Andrew, needs to get rid of the body. This is his alibi. (Kidding 😂)
Why does Garret make things that are SMALL so BIG FOR US !!!
Comfort movies are Harry Potter, Hocus Pocus, Casper and Home Alone 1 and 2
I live like a mile away from where you saw the bones lol. We have a lot of coyotes and bobcats here.I find animal bones in my yard all the time.
Omg here in Michigan I know someone that just had that same car part stolen
"are lobsters immortal"  Definitely the exact search history I was expecting
Burying your spider friend was so cute but the tombstone sent me. 😂🎃  My comfort movies are Indiana Jones and the temple of doom…The Princess Bride and David Bowie’s Labyrinth. Probably in that order. 👻
My comfort movie at the moment , is A Knights Tale .  Keep Trudging. 💚💚
Coraline and Beetlejuice are my comfort movies :-)
Of course we get this blessing on a bones day
spirited away is my comfort movie, and the harry potters

Princess diaries always makes me feel at home. Also Cars for some reason. Glad to see you uploading 🤍
Comfort movies : Harry potters and howls moving castle over … and over … and over again
Pirates of the Caribbean is my ultimate comfort movie 😍
I loved this because I go backcountry camping in Algonquin Park in Ontario, and I love it, but am worried about running into a bear or moose! My comfort movies are Sleepy Hollow(1999) and Cursed(2004)!
my comfort movies are probably twilight (all of them but new moon & the breaking dawn ones especially), the mortal instruments city of bones and the last jedi!
My comfort movies are Shrek (the first one) in Spanish. I CANNOT watch it in English 😂 and Matilda as well. Something so satisfying from seeing her clean with her mind 🤩😅

Garrett I love you but did you know Mercury has been in retrograde? (And several other planets, it's wacky.) This may have to do with your misfortunes..  Love, an omnist witch 💜🖤
I found all of this footage in the woods, I'm so glad that the Watts foundation could edit this together for us. Also my comfort movie is 13 going on 30.
My comfort movie is Conair. I know it’s a terrible movie. Trust me I’m a film major so I’ve been told over and over how bad it is but I truly love it
Catch me if you can is my comfort movie!
I sat here for most of the video before I realized I have the same shirt as Garrett.
My comfort movie is The Princess Bride. My parents divorced when i was very young and my dad would watch it with me when ever we got to see me and my sister. Its just a movie that reminds me of my connection with my dad.
I miss you, luv you luvbug
At least once per year I watch all of the Twilight movies... that is my comfort series
My comfort movie has to be queen of the dammed. It’s not a great movie but I enjoy it. I would also pick pretty much any Marvel movie.
Phew! Garret, take a deep breath! I’m glad you took a break, it’s nice to get away. Maybe you can take another one and truly turn off and not worry about a video. Relax and enjoy!
Shrek, always.
I feel like even if he did get in trouble, the Grim Reaper would be like ‘oh nawh this guy is too cute to die’ and Garret LIVES.
If I'm ever stuck on a deserted island, I hope it is with Garrett!
The Freezer is... MAKING ICE!!!!!
Your energy is just, *mwah*.
Man this man has had the shittiest week imaginable and he has turned that into an excuse to go have a ball! 😁
My comfort movie is Scott pilgrim V.S the world
YEP...!!! YOUR FRIDG IS HUNTED ...THATS LIKE GUARENTEED LOL GHOSTS LOVE WASHING MACHINES AND FRIDGES ....WHY THE WATER PUMP HAS A MAGICAL FREQUENCY ITS LIKE A CHARGING STATION ...BASICALLY ITS HAUNTED LOL
I'm going to make your laugh my ring tone because it makes me so happy!
HOW ABOUT ASKING ONE OF YOUR FANS IF THEY CAN REPAIR YOUR FRIDGE ...ASK AND YOU SHALL RECEICE HELLO WHO YOU GOING TO CALL LOL
My comfort movie is The Muppets Movie (2011) I’ve seen it hundreds of times and sob at the ending Kermit speech every time that shit slaps so hard
I had such a bad day and week and this made everything better for 30 mins:)
YOUR NOT AGNOSTIC ...YOUR A BELIEVER IN THE TRUTH YEAH DONT BE AFRAID ...BECAUSE I`M RIGHT BEYIND YOU BOO!!! LOL THAT WAS JOKE ...LOVE WATCHING YOUR CHANNEL
I know this is like “Garrett’s style” or whatever, but is anybody else concerned about how genuinely reckless this is. Like no hate to Garrett ily him, but I’m just a little worried
4:08 "I'm not just gonna reach in and just eat frozen berries" 😭 I do that!!!
1) you look like zeke from snk 2) now youre the child screaming and crying at the campground for ice cream in a very specific shop
My comfort movie is and has always been Barbie Mermaidia idk why that movie just 🤗 perfection
I don't have a comfort movie.....🤡
this video just made my day!!  my comfort movie is kill your darlings rip, yes i know this is a bad look for me TT
Hi Garrett, thank you for making my day brighter as you always do with every upload you make. Also, my comfort movie(s) are Spirited Away and Labyrinth, I will never get tired of them.
The bear costume 🥺
My comfort movie isn’t just one movie. It’s The Hobbit and LOTR movies. They make me feel at home 🙂
so glad you didn't die Garrett! it might have been good content for one video but in the long run I'd say dying is sorta counterproductive to getting one's shit together xD and to answer your question I actually made a list recently with my comfort movies and there's a lot on it but my faves are definitely Bridget Jones, My Neighbour Totoro, all the old Barbie Movies from like the early 2000s and my recently discovered new fave Bollywood film Shaandaar!
When you said a bear scarecrow the first time I was so disappointed that you didn’t call it a “Bearcrow”! I loved every single thing other than that about this video though haha
I feel like we’d all be like Garrett if we didn’t lose our imagination and curiosity.
My comfort thing isn’t a movie but it’s a show called “The Owl House” and it’s about a girl who wants to be a human witch and it’s also lgbtq and it’s on Disney and it’s a great show and my all time favorite and I feel like u might like it too idk I just feel like U would but yeah literally my comfort show bc luz the main character reminds me of myself in a way
A garrett upload in spooky month. we truly have been blessed.   my comfort movie is "Pirate's of The Caribbean". just. all of them.
Ok is it just me or has anyone else been getting spam in old comments from old videos? Like it’s not your typical spam where it’s clearly a bot but it’s like they actually watched the video but the profile pic and username are 18+? I dunno it’s just kinda weird, they’re not saying anything particularly bad but I’m just getting so many notifications from these people/bots replying to my comments on this channel
You are my spirit animal.
a lot of people are gonna say its cringe but for me its the twilight saga that brings me comfort cause when i moved out into the mountains with my dad we bonded over the franchise.. every time i see Bella's dad i still think of my own dad.. sadly he passed away over a year ago but ill never forget bonding with such a burly "Mans man" who worked for an auto parts store over something as silly as sparkly vampires haha
Comfort movies Moulin Rouge (I sing all the tracks in my car too, don't worry) The breakfast club And The 10th Kingdom (highly recommend Mister Garrett, I think, you'd love this movie... its a hidden gem. Btw it's 7 hours long. I'm sorry. But it's free on YouTube 🙂😅😁
ok but why is nobody talking about that light behind him at 24:55 what the...
Comfort Movie: Scooby-Doo (2002)
Hardcore hufflepuff energy
omg what was that light behind you at 24:55
This is all the plan of mercury retrogade garrett
my comfort movie is unironically the first IT remake, and also tangled :)
Congratulations Garrett you’ve discovered the effects of Mercury retrograde on geminis
I have two comfort movies. My first one would have to be pitch perfect one, and the second movie would have to be tangled. I live them soo much.
My comfort movie would definitely have to be “A Silent Voice” on Netflix. I have watched that 2hr long movie so many times and each time I cry. It’s such a good movie. Very sweet, emotional, just everything I’ve wanted to feel while enjoying a movie. I definitely recommend it for anyone who has Netflix or has a way to watch it somehow and are anime fans. Or people who just want to find a movie to watch.   Btw amazing video and I’m glad you didn’t get eaten by a bear or a woods zombie!
Missed opportunity to title this video “Garrett Watts: Outside” featuring -bo burnham look alike -singing about how you currently feel while playing the piano -absolutely losing your mind over the state of the world
my comfort movie is any Studio Ghibli classic but Howl's moving castle, spirited away and my neighbor totoro have my heart
The skeleton in the pool as home security is literally my mindset 🤣 once I heard someone right outside my backyard so played demon noises to freak them out so they would leave, it worked. I now realise that was a strange thing to do after typing it...
That fact you probably just had a whole funeral for what probably was the skin a spider shed when it grew out of it is so funny 🙈 love your videos ❤️
your videos are my comfort videos
Eventually this is how all ADHD people die. They wander off into the Wilderness never to be seen again. One day I'm going to marry this man and keep him safe from himself LOL Comfort movie, 28 days. The one where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab
the goonies man. top tier comfort  movie
my comfort film is John Cusack's magnum opus, 2012
why am i attracted to you
Benjamin is honestly getting more and more adorable for me
Why does he have a hay hook? Random Garrett...
Garrett could make a video about a piece of paper and it would be entertaining lol
HAHAHA WHEN I SAW THE THUMBNAIL I WAS LITERALLY LIKE "he looks like bo burnham in that" AND THEN 15 SECS IN HE SAYS THE SAME THING
Comfort movie is currently spirited away
My comfort movie, which I understand is maybe not the most well loved movie but "Life of the party" with Melissa McCarthy Is one of mine.
Garrett is the only bear in the woods 🌚🌚🌚 #IfYouKnowWhatIMean
ily garrett
comfort movies: elf, polar express, grease, finding nemo lol
all of the hunger games movies are my comfort movie
Into the Wild type shit
my comfort movies are tangled (i know the entire movie by heart that's how many times i watched it), the third harry potter for some reason and spirited away
okay this sounds so weird but my comfort movie’s definitely it chapter two
My comfort movie is 13 going on 30, 100%
Aww Garrett, you have such a pretty singing voice. 🧚🏼‍♀️
garrett are you doing okay?
It wouldnt matter is Garret made a whole video of himself watching a movie in silence, I would watch every second of it because just his existence makes me smile. My comfort movie is Wall-E :')
I love you Garrett but that'a very wrong definition of agnosticism.
Garrett is my adult teddy bear and he brings me comfort 🧸😭
Plan: escape to the woods Packing: a small picnic
I want my own *platonic Garrett cuddle buddy. Where can I sign up? 👀
My whole spirit is jumping along to all of this as I beautifully relate
I’m gonna move to the woods too fuck this shit.
Hey, so I don't know if you'll see this but over the last few days, since this upload, I have been getting a lot of random replies to my comments on your videos. These are bot channels that are using explicit profile images and their brand new channels to direct people toward p*rnographic content and websites. I don't have a problem with p*rn or explicit content but it looks like someone is targeting your audience for scam websites using this kind of content.
Does anyone know if the sweetboys podcast is coming back ?? :/
Garrett, when you do things like the sword catch my heart stops, please be careful, the world can't afford to lose someone as awesome as you. Edit: my comfort movies are The Incredibles and Good Mythical Morning (ok it's not a movie but I watch it before bed).
Wait, why didnt Garrett bring up the fact it kinda looked like the trailer from Kill Bill?
My comfort movie is 100% Footloose. Like how can you not feel happiness when watching it!
On a real note @garret can you be my best friend I love your imagination 😍
My comfort movie is also pretty mmuch any Harry Potter. I watch them everyday when I am sad
My comfort movie is tangled and the maze runner trilogy
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind is a big ol comfort film of mine- whilst simultaneously being slightly chaotic and melancholy, but like, a perfect balance of the two that makes me want to gather all my fleeces, blankets and oversized hoodie, park my self i under my desk where i have a bunch of led’s and drift away into a dissociative state of pure mortal-absent comfort whilst i let the film play on repeat in the background and catch lil quotes and scenes from the movie and kinda drift off into random fjords of empty mental space.  Either that or spirited away, 101 dalmations (cartoon or the Gem with Glen Close), nausica or school of rock. All you’re missing is Chinese/Japanese food that is all just sides and no mains.  Hope i get the opportunity to run away to the woods and serve that semi-primal need for isolation, congrats bestie, see you in the next 6 months, you’re doing totally not horrible 📸 xox
My comfort movie is sherk👉👈
my great grandfather who i was close with died and had his burial last week, and this for sure cheered me up, garrett <3 i am always so grateful for your content. i love you :.)
watch out for Brian Laundrie in nature Garrett
My comfort movie is Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2
I love watching garret he makes my day
I don’t have a comfort movie but I always watch/put on family guy at night, Peter being a neglecting father I think scares away the negativity, you know.
everything not to do when going into the woods
Any Winnie the Pooh movie/series is my ultimate comfort movies❤️
I'm not feeling it at all your boring now we feel that's not the way it ues to be when Shane Rayan Morgan and Jeffree was in your life you glowed bye
the michael scottification of garrett
22:33 looks like a bear on the left of garrett...I had a panik attack FOR him just there!
Mine would have to be Moana and CoCo. I had surgery a last summer and was in the hospital for 9 days. And for that nine days Moana and CoCo were on repeat and I wouldn’t let anyone change it lol
my comfort movie is princess and the frog. literally love that movie.  either that or perks of being a wallflower <3
blair witch project (real)
My comfort movie is about time. I cry every time I watch it but it’s so damn good🥲
God I love you garrett. holy shit.
When ever garrett post I always get so happy he makes my whole day!!! My favorite comfort movie has gotta be The kung fu panda movies I'm embarrassed to say that as a 15 (almost 16) year old but if anyone judges me SCREW YOU! (I'm kidding I respect your opinions lol) the kung fu panda movies are MASTERPIECES.
The twilight saga is my comfort movie 🍿 btw I think ur amazing
When I feel sad or too tired to watch an in-depth film I just put on any Adam Sandler film lol so i guess that counts as comfort movie Otherwise any film with Ewan McGregor in it, especially I Love You Phillip Morris, like yes pls
When I saw Benjamin behind the log at night, it scared the fuck outta me 🤣🤣🤣  Glad to see you’re doing well….ish 😅♥️👍 hope things work out with your car and fridge! Keep us updated!
comfort movie is ernest et celestine because yes
garrett i love and appreciate u thank u for the video made my night 🥰🥰🥰
My comfort movie is definitely coraline or any tim burton film. I watch it with my little brothers like every year.
My comfort movie is Halloween town, and Harry potter and the sorcerer's stone.
This is funny and all but i don't think y'all want to do this irl. Aside from probably being illegal and trespassing, going off a trail is extremely dangerous. What could feel like just a few feet could be enough to completely turn you around in the wilderness. People die doing this. I know we like this man-childlike behavior as entertainment but please do NOT do this. If you want an escape, actually take the time to find a campground. Your fees will go to a state park and help preserve it and it will be just as rewarding. Bring more than enough food and water and an adult coloring book or something.
Garrett looking like zeke jaeger when he was left alone with levi in the woods 💀
Not gonna lie I started to panic once I realized he left a trail of cookies which will lead said lethal winning the Pooh bears to his location  Glad to know he is okay lolol
some of my comfort movies are both princess diaries 1 and 2, the little rascals, all Jurassic park and Jurassic world movies, mama mia 1 and 2, a goofy movie (along with alot of other disney movies), How's moving castle, spirited away, and a few others I cant think of rn. so less of a comfort movie and more of a comfort movie list lol
were u manic when u filmed this be honest
OMG HE LOOKS LIKE ZEKE FROM ATTACK ON TITAN
Weirdly enough my comfort movie is Cat in the Hat the 2003 live-action adaptation
GARRETT. I was just in the comments to say that my comfort movie is 50 First Dates and then you said it was yours too. 🥲 Love you!
See.. If I got all those signs I would think the universe were telling me to stay home and never see the outside place again. Not... run away into the trees. This is why Garret is so adorable.
Why dose Garrett look like one of those “I survived a year win the woods (and I never shaved)” type of guy?
my comfort movie is Spiderman into the spider verse!!!!! and Luca!! and SO manY MORE MOVIES AAAAAAAAAAA
Aquamarine is my comfort movie I can't even count how many times I've seen it
My go to comfort movie of all time is all the Harry Potter movies 😂 I just marathon them when I’m really needing to feel safe and comforted and stuff 🥺
Garrett’s whole YouTube channel brings me comfort  🤌✨
Wait so it the podcast not coming back !?  Honestly ur facial hair doesn't look bad just makes u look older but kinda works for you

But ide have to say my comfort movie the holiday with jack black or serendipity (2001). They are classics and I just love the humor and romance combo in both movies.

omg, i love talking about comfort movies-- I've been asking people that recently too!!!  I would say mine is 10000% dead poet's society,,, i just stop watching before the last 10 minutes so i don't get sad :))
GET ME THAT SINGLE NOW!! That shloops slapping, man.
The woods call to me , you’re brick home is telling you to go , you’ll do fine 😬
Tommy Boy. Amazing movie, I used to watch with my dad a lot.

my comfort video is probably My Neighbor Totoro because it was the first anime I've ever watched and its just heckin wholesome
Hi from UK love your silliness Garrett & Nightmare on Elm street 2 is my comfort film 😉
Turn your frig  off. Maybe it’s frost over inside. Let it melt and turn back on.
Garrett is me whenever I pack for a 2 day trip
My comfort movies are Mama Mia, Coco, The Lord of the Rings/Hobbit trilogy’s and many more. Also watching your old videos on repeat
my comfort  movie is IT idk there's just something about a movie where 7 gay teenagers fight a killer clown that just makes me feel  happy
oh Garrett lol
There were many bad ideas in this video, but lettuce on a bean burrito was definitely the worst one... respectfully.
I have too many comfort movies :o all of the Harry Potter's, Tim Burton films, all Pixar movies but especially Luca and Ratatouille, Little Women, She's the Man, and so much moreee
oohh! I like this question, so my comfort movies are The Craft, Twilight Breaking Dawn part ii but only the fight scene, the Bee Movie, and all the Alice in Wonderland movies ESPECIALLY the one with Whoopi, oh wait and Coraline
why does Garrett exists if not to make me crave taco bell at 1 in the morning
My comfort movie is The Incredible Burt Wonderstone!!
You look great. Love you! Enjoy the woods.✌❤
My comfort movie is George of The Jungle! If I ever get married, I want my first dance song to be the song that George and Ursula dance to at their wedding 🥺🥺🥺(Dela by Johnny Clegg and Sevuka)
good boys is my comfort movie rn it makes me laugh so much
Cat in the hat live action
I hope you enjoyed your bath after that scary spontaneous trip, I'm glad you did get to bury your friend in a peaceful place. Unrelated: Have you ever researched Autism? I'm Autistic and get overwhelmed easily too. Your trip had some great happy moments, but you did seem very overwhelmed.
My comfort movie is corpse bride lol i remember watching it when I was smaller only in Spanish, but now that i know English and stuff lol it makes me feel so grown and nice inside idk just watching it fills my little heart happy
Garret’s amazing music reminds me of bo burnham
Ok I’m never commenting on YouTube videos but I just have to answer this question 😔✋ TANGLED!!! I watched it so many times as a child it’s actually crazy and I found it comforting to fall asleep while watching it. It’s also a really good movie 🙄
From the catalytic converter theft (fellow Angeleno) to freezing in the woods this video churned my stomach. It was a great reminder that even tho Life seems greener on the other side it’s probably not🤷‍♀️.   I usually use TV like The office, new girl, or curb ur enthusiasm for comfort. However movies like Django, Inglorious bastards, and the bee movie always make me happy If I can commit for their entirety.
where you are looks like that one episode from the office called "Survivor Man" where Dwight "leaves" Michael in the woods!!
My comfort movie is Paranorman!!! It’s by Laika studios who made Coraline! You would love it!!
How to train your dragon 1 and the guardians with Jack Frost
Harry Potter or 21 jump street or pitch perfect
COMFORT MOVIE ⁉️⁉️  I LOVE THE BEE MOVIE
My comfort movies are Aladdin and Beauty and the beast the original cartoon versions
My comfort movie is howls moving castle :]
hmmm most probably corpse bride or monster house :)
The zombie noise is 100% a tummy rumble
INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE IS MY COMFORT MOVIE
I also bought a teddy bear because my nightmares were getting more horrific than they usually do!!  I brought it on vacation with me when I went with my sister and her family and was ridiculed for being 23 and having to sleep with a light and a teddy bear.  My sister actually went "Oh and here's your stupid bear you big baby!" And threw him at me when we were bringing things inside the house 😾
My comfort movies are either older animated Disney movies; like Hercules and Mulan; and then there is the movie Practical Magic!
Comfort is binging on star trek 🖖
gosh ily smm, thank u 4 this <33 ur my comfort youtuber, we’ve missed u this spooky szn
I couldn’t even finish the video because of his screaming and talking… ty for the headache
My comfort movie is A knights tale, Muppets Christmas carol, 50 first dates, or the 5th element. They all calm me when I need grounding from overwhelming anxiety.
I wanna tie Garrett's hair up in a MaN bUn SOOO bad.
Hey, friendly neighborhood witch here. The cinnamon broom is such a good idea, for more than just the buggies. It’s a very protective herb, but it’s also has super healing energy. Protected physically and spiritually, but also healing along the way with Mother Nature. ❤️
Now I’m craving bit-o-honey. Thanks, Garret.
I don’t really know what my comfort movie is. I feel as though I don’t re-watch movies enough and I also don’t know what comforts me as of late. I’m not sure...but I’m happy you are alive
No question, my comfort film is any of the Harry Potter films. I can't explain how much joy Hedwig's theme brings me and seeing my childhood in front of eyes. Love love love love Harry Potter
My comfort movie is either the original Muppet Movie or Bo Burnham:Inside because I know it's considered a stand-up comedy special but I consider it a movie and I don't know why but it's very comforting to me.
Pride and prejudice, infinity war( and basically every marvel movie), monsters inc, monsters university, the princess diaries, tangled, zootopia, the list of comfort movies goes on forever🦖
my movie has to be 13 going on to 30 💘
Your videos make me so happy
me , actually me. This video is dangerous.
I don’t really have a comfort movie but I really like old horror movies:)
comfort movie 100% would be cheaper by the dozen two. always has been, always will be. not enough people talking about it and it's honestly ridiculous.
I'm happy to see a new video but I'm gonna be honest, are you doing alright Garret? :(
all dogs go to heaven or disneys robbin hood, they are what i always watched to feel better since i was a babe
"where's Andrew Siwicki when you need him" same
Has anyone else noticed how similar Garrett looks to Zeke Yeager?? (; o-o)
you bring me so much joy. I feel so lost in my life right now but when i watch your videos i feel normal and like i'm not alone.... thank you!!!
27:08 - (Not) from the producers of Bo Burnham's "Inside": Garrett Watts' "Outside"
I'm glad you didn't die in the woods. my comfort movies are Labyrinth and (500) Days of Summer...I watch Labyrinth everytime it rains, with the windows open. and the other just brings me back to reality when you know something up front and in your head you make it a different situation. trust the truth, even if you don't like the answer.
Garrett is pure sex. The end
i think Garrett would actually hate me if he knew i was spider serial killer
Has anyone asked where Andrew is?
My comfort movie is The Wedding Singer.  I honestly don't know why.
DO YOU WANT TO SEE MY PET BUG????????
My comfort movie is Coraline because, yeah. Love you Garrett!
My comfort movie would be any muppet movie or a musical movie like mamma mia or across the universe
You uploaded this on a No Bones Day, which is a win in my book! Hope everything gets better for you 🤗

the mummy 1 & 2
About Time, Mean Girls, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Crazy Stupid Love
omg stooooppp, we have the same comfort movie’s. i’ve seen coco probably 100 times and 50 first dates probably like 1000 times.
Hey Garrett….. i think you look amazing. Doin Hufflepuff proud. So stop trash talking yourself. ❤️
50 first dates is definitely in my top five but I have to give my number one spot to uptown girls with Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning
One of my comfort movies is definitely Disney’s Moana. Something about it is just really grounding and I love the story and all of the visuals. It’s so pretty!   I am also very sad about the bathroom spider, RIP king
I don’t have a comfort movie but my comfort tv show is One Tree Hill 🤗
My comfort movies are Tarzan and Muppets from Space
I love 50 first dates!! One of my all time faves! ☺️
INSIDE ERA BO BURNHAM HELP
*are lobsters immortal*
My comfort film is The Great Mouse Detective.  There's something about Vincent Price playing a fat rat..I mean MOUSE...He's NOT a rat at all evil mastermind  that's really heartwarming.
Lmao the catalytic converter being stolen is everywhere. I work at a collision center in San Antonio and literally for a while they would call and I would say let me guess your catalytic converter is gone huh
Beetlejuice is my comfort movie ♥️

Answer to the question is one you’ll know. It’s inside by Bo Burnham. I feel like that says a lot about my declining mental health. I don’t only know all the songs. But all the words. Every word. I love it. I feel like I can relate to Bo very well and that thought terrifies me. I will now send you a video on tiktok that I think you’ll like. (Edit) I went on tiktok but forgot because I got distracted eating a fake gummy foot.
My comfort movie is either Tangled, Shark Tale, or Talladega Night

Please do an actual camp out video with Andrew - safer and more fun for you.
I don't have a comfort movie but I have a comfort show and that's degrassi the next generation. Also love you, mountain man.
into the spider verse
I think you look great with the beard and long hair!

you should make the interior of your house like you’re living in a forest so it’s like an escape
POV: You're driving up to Oregon and on the way you catch a glimpse of a man in a plaid shirt, with a sword and a shovel, filming himself dragging a skeleton deep into the woods.

Practical magic is my comfort movie! When I die I wanna be buried with it, straight up

Garrett is living my dream, I mean running away screaming into the woods to avoid my responsibilities to figure out what the hell this all means ... Also, I live in the blue ridge mountains, and am surrounded by woods, so it's always tempting lmao

My comfort film is sweeney todd. It just makes me feel nice. Thank you for this video, Garrett 💜 it made me smile even though I've been going through it.
I sometimes think the really expensive things in your life just decide to all break at the same time. In the span of 8 months our hot water heater burned out a element, our air conditioning unit, fridge and washer broke and had to be replaced! 😫
Penelope is my comfort movie, for sure.  I think you might need to put it on in the back ground at least after the week you've had.  Hang tough boo.

Star Wars: Return of the Jedi is definitely my comfort movie.
CORALINE!!! also any of the equestria girl movies
Howl's Moving Castle
Oh how I’ve missed your videos! So glad you’re back again!
There's private property woods, there's public forests which would be the common collective forests for the people of the nation, that's a state park or national park, and there are novelty campgrounds, church owned camp grounds, college university owned woods, or rent a place that has woods, vacation property with woods. there are insurance liabilities and water rights involved with land, it can't just be whimsical freedom fairyland.  sorry bud.
Comfort movie is always a HARRY POTTER MARATHON, onesie jammies, hot chocolate, popcorn and candies. Oh and a big fluffy blanket. Also happy you didn’t die in the wilderness! 😂 you are braver than me I would never have done that alone.
lord of the rings as well as lilo and stitch! keep being you garrett!!
Ponyo or newsies
i kinda feel embarrassed about it but monsters inc. is my comfort movie. i’ve watched that movie religiously as a child so it just grew on me and i’ve never gotten tired of it, even now as a 19 year old in my second year of college.
Lol loved how the hair keeps flipping in the different frames 🤣 and the whole look was throwing me out during the entire video. Love ya
Recently my confort SHOW has been The Simpsons! & what we do in the shadows
My comfort movie is Charlie and the chocolate factory. I love Johnny Depp's acting in it and how freaking passive aggressive he was lol, it makes me feel really happy and calm whenever I watch it.
It should be illegal that you didn’t make an Aragog reference during the spider burial
I guess I’ll see you in six months again you don’t put out a video very often lol
im also gonna claim 50 first dates, i also like the last mimzy, and larry the cable guy's health inspector lmao
Screaming at my phone when he said he was WEARING SANDALS
My comfort movie is Titanic!! The score makes me cry even to this day. There’s just something so melancholic about it but comforting at the same time.  I’m so happy they put it back on Netflix :)
This made me laugh so much😂
Hey there! Funny thing that you’re bringing up comfort movies!! My husband and I were just laughing about this yesterday. Every night (and I mean EVERY NIGHT) as we fall asleep, he turns nextflix on on his phone and puts on Spirited Away, then places the phone upside down on the nightstand and we just listen to it as we fall asleep. Sometimes multiple times a night! We’ve been making jokes that we are SINGLE HANDEDLY keeping Spirited Away on Netflix with our religious nightly routine of playing it and discussing the new things we’re discovering about it. This has been a habit for about 6-7 months now, and it’s crazy to me how we can still put it on and have a new theory to discuss before drifting off to sleep. 💜 Anyways! Keep up the good work, love the videos! (Also, 50 first dates is a BOMB comfort movie. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻)
My comfort movie is Hairspray (the 2007 with Zac Efron and Nikki Blonski)
The Nightmare Before Christmas 🥰
He legit got kids tent in the woods on the middle of nowhere 💀  🤣
my comfort movie(s) have to be 50 First Dates, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, The Princess Bride and probably Over The Hedge.
My comfort movies are singing in the rain, far and away and the wedding singer.
I weirdly watch Spotlight as a comfort movie.  I know child abuse doesn't really yell comfort but I think people figuring shit out does...
Garret is going to sit here and tell me that for COMFORT he will watching Harry Potter 4-8???
comfort movies include both of the IT movies <3 they may be shit but they're MY shit <3
Garrett, you own a bear costume and a whip, do not pretend we don't know these are related.
13 going on 30 c: glad you didn't get eaten by a zombie or bear or a zombie bear or a bear liking zombie or a zombie liking bear

I HAVE THE SAME CINNAMON BROOM
Ginger snaps is my all time favorite comfort movie. I never ever get tired of watching it and everytime I feel down or overwhelmed by life it helps cheer me up. Campy horror teenager coming of age movie about werewolves is something that can be so personal.
Garrett with the whip bahahaha
How did Andrew let Garrett out by himself?
Put your phone in a bowl of rice for a day or so and should work fine afterwards
From the time you got into your car I thought "If he gets pulled over, he's going to jail." Love it.
Go to Colorado
I’m 24 and married and still sleep with 2 stuffed animals
Strangely the first comfort movie that comes to mind is Spider-Man: Far From Home
You know it says a lot about Garrett as a creator that even his sponsored ad portions are entertaining!!!! I usually skip through but I actually forgot to cuz I was entertained by it LOL 😊❤️
Cat convertor theft is bad here in okc , every night my work place gets hit for 1-2 a night. Spray paint helps detour them
That moulin rouge in the car is me 😪💌
my comfort movies are: rocky horror picture show, it chapter 2,and  practical magic
Benjamin Lore?
My comfort movies are definitely Scream and insidious! Love you Garrett!
I feel like Garrett only goes on special adventures so he can go around “gathering supplies” and that in turn gives him so much serotonin cause all his favorite movie heros “gather supply”
When my area lost power for 10 days after a Hurricaine a few years ago, the only DVD we had was 50 First Dates. We would run the generator to keep ours and the neighbors fridge running, and also to watch that movie every day for 12 days straight. (12 days because we didn't have cable or internet for an extra 2 days there). So in a way, 50 First Dates is also one of my comfort movies
garrett I've been watching you for like 5 years and you read my comment in a video once but i just need you to know that every upload makes my heart happier and my day brighter and i just really appreciate you :')

My comfort movie would have to be tangled, or that long forgotten I wanna say dream works film called epic.
Garrett's chaotic energy somehow calms me and I have no idea how or why. It just does. I love you Garrett!

When I was in Middle School my comfort movie was Lords of Dog town, I watched it everyday after school. Now I would say it’s probably Grandma’s Boy.
😊😊
So I'm sitting here taking a sip of my drink right? Garrett reads the note Benjamin wrote and when he got to the toes part I spit my drink out. That was so funny😭😂 I love Garretts mind
i'm so happy you didn't get a dumb idea like lighting a fire too keep warm or something

I just want to marry Garrett with that new beard

Garret, you look like if all of The Beatles had a kid.
my fav youtuber. love your content!!  my comfort movie is twitches
My comfort movie is The shining for suuuure
Garrett, I love you so much, I UNDERSTAND your desire to just get up and leave everything, high key. You're also so nuts and I'm so glad you didn't die in the woods 🤣  My comfort movie is cats don't dance, it was an old nineties Warner brothers animated kids movie musical. Played that and rewinded songs over so often as a young kid that I broke the vhs tape.
I have so many comfort movies but the two that come to mind is Kick Ass and Raising Arizona
Comfort movies: Mama Mia Emperors New Groove IT Moana
Uhm, it's called "Lemba bread", and I love that you referenced it. Also, can we send gifts to Benjamin?
You are truly the best! I always feel pure happiness when I watch your videos. You’re just wonderful, Garrett! And my comfort movie, well at least one of them would definitely be You’ve Got Mail, with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. Ugh, sooo good!! ❤️❤️❤️
For anyone who may have missed Garrett’s disclaimer - DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS. What he did (at least as he presented it) is incredibly dangerous. If you are going to go out into the wilderness, you need to make sure people know where you are going and when you plan to come back. You need to have water (or a way to filter water), food (or know how to forage), shelter, a way to maintain your body temperature, sufficient first aid, and a way to navigate. Ideally, you will also have a way to communicate if you’re going into the back country. Additionally, you should always abide by the Leave No Trace principles (so definitely don’t leave a trail of cookies for a bear to both become accustomed to people food as well as to have an easy way to find you while you sleep).    I know this was more for entertainment than anything, but the amount of times people get lost and need SAR or die from doing this same kind of thing without proper supplies, planning, and experience is far too high. Absolutely, get out into nature and experience that freedom and peace, but do it safely and in a way that won’t leave a negative impact on nature.
the silhouette of Garrett burying his friendspider cracked me up... this was wild
My comfort movie is grinch and Halloween 🥰🥰

Periodically my soul needs me to watch Braveheart. Honorable mentions include Adam sandler movies, the hotel transylvania series, and most of Disney's catalog of animated movies
Garrett is literally my spirit animal! Lettuce on a bean burrito is delicious! As for comfort movies.. if I’ve had a bad day or need cheering up, I’m always down for pride and prejudice with Keira knightly. That or a lame romcom!
I think Garrett should pile up the skeletons and Benjamin in his car to make any car-part-thieves think twice!
okay can we talk about Garretts singing?? like is it just me or is he really good?
Garrett lives like an emancipated 12 year old and I love it

Benjamin legit looks like he's growing
HOW. HOW are you so relatable, while _simultaneously_ being funnier than I will literally ever be 🤣  Ps. I had 2 spiders that lived in my bedroom. Their names were Lucky, and ABBA, and I loved them because they kept the icky earwigs from crawling into my orifices while I slept. They died when it got cold, and I now wish I’d buried them in mini coffins 🥺 On the plus side tho, all the earwigs are also burning in hades where they belong.
My comfort movie is ratatouille idk y. I watch it every night to sleep lol
Coneheads is my go to comfort movie
Dearest Mr. Garrett,  in the next video may we please have an impression of shaggy from scooby doo?  i think besides mathew lillard you might have have born for it. In warmest regards- Me.
It was the “ Gotcha Bitch! “ for me 😭😭🤣🤣
Coraline is my comfort movie<3
Love watching you! Thanks for sharing!
mercury is in retrograde. so if your signs align with mercury you will find energies pulling from our earth. This is likely the reason for why these things are happening. This is the last week of retrograde so you should be good to enter back into civilization now.
This retro renegade has gotten to you  Also, now, let's talk about the whip Mr. Garrett 👀
Mr. Right with Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick is mine
Biggest comfort movies - wildly different from one another, hahaha 1) Rocky (absolute favorite movie of all time and such a sweet love story) 2) Alfonso Cuarón's "A Little Princess" ( more like the movie to make me ugly cry but also feel warm inside) 3) The Holiday (seriously it is so sweet WHY IS IT SO GOOD) 4) Titanic (who the hell knows why okay it just is) 5) Hocus Pocus (it's hard not to feel happy watching this)
The sound of music is my comfort movie. I fall asleep to it any time my partner is away.
My comfort movie has to be Howl's Moving Castle.... or Mamma Mia...... or Mamma Mia Here We Go Again
I want you to be my best friend!!! You are so fun!!
All jokes aside, I hope you're feeling a bit better. Really loving your editing as always <3

Garrett i live up in Sacramento and people have been stealing catalytic converters here too, my neighbor's got stolen like 2 weeks ago :( it helps if you park your car with the front wheels turned to the side, it makes it harder for the catalytic converter to come off I think, thats what we do with our car :) hope things work out for u

The 90s Addams Family movie are my comfort go to movie. It was one of the first movies I saw when I was younger that showed a dysfunctional family with a husband who was loving to his spouse. The movies helped me feel confident in my love of the weird and macabre. And it aged sooooo well!!!

My comfort movie is Labrynth with David Bowie (he is a total babe in those tights) or any of the Harry Potter movies. Maybe even Titanic. Catch Me If You Can is also a very good one. Garrett, help pls

REAL STEEL WITH HUGH JACKMAN
Sweet boy I always miss you thank you for another video
I was eating and when that sword hit you I almost CHOKED 😂😂
My comfort movie definitely would be Spirited Away (funny since you actually showed it on the video). Also, if I may, I am going to also be adding my comfort anime is Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae o Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (also known as Anohana). It's a pretty sad anime but I don't know why it always brings so many emotions and I ended up getting really attached to all of the characters. I really recommend it if you wanna cry.
Hey brother, I’m sorry it’s been tough for you with all that’s happened, your content is phenomenal and we hope you keep pumping out more amazing stuff in the near future, take care Garrett love ya man ❤👊
Comfort movie would be spirited away or kiki's delivery service. Or the mummy movies.
just wanted to say a big thankyou to you garret, i was having a bad panic attack and this really calmed me down - thankyou again <3
All the bad stuff happening, is definitely not related to you going to the haunted hospital 😳🥴
Aw no, you look adorable I didn't think you looked bad at all!
Your in the woods…GOOD, STAY THERE
I'm sorry about your car 😟 it's been bad here in western mass, too. Somebody stole 30 catalytic converters off the towns school buses a few months back.
Low key wish upon a star is a great comfort movie
the sandlot
My comfort film is definitely "Singin 'in the rain" The music, the singing, the dancing, the absolutely ridiculously cheesy plot... What else can you wish for
You forgot the campfire and marshmallows 💙
You know that one player in every dnd party that always plays the super bubbly adorable chaotic good rock gnome or sumthin along those lines Garrett is their character brought into the real world but he still functions under game rules Also my comfort movie is overboard  (The original not the new one)
Sweet friend,  I think the message the universe is giving you is to leave LA and move to Washington and come hang out and be in nature in the Seattle area and we can be besties
My comfort movie is Twilight even though it’s really shit hahaha it’s the cosy feel for me
I wish that I could hire Garrett's voice and overall vibe to narrate my internal monologue. I think like Garrett speaks all day long, but my brain is nowhere near as entertaining as Garrett is.
I’m worried about him lol
my comfort movies are Beetlejuice and Big Hero 6!! i can't count the number of times i've watched beetlejuice
my comfort movies are the twilight series.... i am not ashamed. not at all...i promise-
My comfort movie is the Steven Universe one hahaha I've seen it 8 times
my comfort movie is Repo Man (1984). it's the best film to be made by human hands
A bearcrow if you will
My comfort movies are, weirdly enough, all the Narnia movies (but especially the first one)
Garrett is a full representation of my brain in a person.
I refuse to date a man till i find someone like garrett. Back to big booty females till the awakening
Hmmm….maybe you’re not agnostic????????
Twilight is my comfort movie, I know it's bad but it's really nice to just sit down and laugh my ass off at the film at the end of a hard day.
OoOoo I don’t really have a specific comfort movie, but I always watch Disney or studio Ghibli movies to feel cozy and nostalgic (even thought Ghibli movies were before my time lollll)
Wow it sucks that I am just now seeing that Garrett posted a video but dang does it make my day! Been having a good day and this was some nice whip cream and sprinkles on top :)
I clicked on it thinking this as asmr 💀💀
My comfort movie is Labyrinth… Better times. 😫
My comfort movies are labyrinth and young Frankenstein...two childhood classics 👌 and also any Disney princess movie, preferably the ones made from little mermaid to present time
Comfort movie: the little prince/ book of life  Comfort show: my babysitters a vampire/ ouron high school host club  Comfort book: house in the cerulean sea/ red white and royal blue
i feel like this video was a gift from the universe :')  ALSO MY COMFORT MOVIE IS 1000% EDDIE THE EAGLE BECAUSE HOLY COW DO YOU SEE THAT PRECIOUS MAN WITH HIS GLASSES AND LITTLE SMILE ? ? ??????????????
My main comfort movie is anything studio Ghibli honestly as well as hunger games
Garrett, please upload again soon :D I love you!
Its because like 5 planets are currently in retrograde.  No seriously Garrett. Look it up. The whole world is experiencing  some form of crazy shit right now. Over the past few months several very troublesome things have happened to me as well. It's been going on for a few months now but what so unusual about it is its multiple planets at the same time instead of just one or two. Usually its mercury causing trouble but no this time its mercury,  Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune all at once! Oh yeah and Pluto too if you want to count that little fella.
The biggest problem I’m having with this is that they delivered the car on empty
Am I the only one who thinks Garrett’s beard and hair looks super cool?
Me and my two dogs love you. *hug* be save
COWBOY BEBOP!!!!
The movies “Black cauldron” and “ The Great Mouse detective” may be some of my comfort cause I just remember watching them on my old VCR all the time.
AH!? My cat converter was stolen a while back, my fridge gave out but my freezer still works, my hairstylist left the business so I have to find a new one... but I mean, my phone still works... for now. Should... should I run to the woods!?
you should do a part two where you and andrew go camping
Rocky Horror Picture Show is my comfort movie!
Whenever Garrett posts it's "BMO! :)" and then you see the preview of the scariest places and it's "BMO! D:"

Garret Watts: Outside
Alternative title:30’s old shaggy goes to woods having a mental crisis while making a video about it
😪😪😪🙏🙏😪🙏🙏🙏You have two hands.  One to help oneself and the other to help others.   10.  Helping others is the fare of being in your world.  So don’t be arrogant about it.   11.  Helping someone may not change the world, but it can change that person.   12.  Today I found that if you want to love someone, you have to bring out the best version of him by helping him and not by changing him.
My comfort movies are “jack and the cuckoo clock heart” and “To Wong foo, thanks for everything”
What a waist of oxygen wow
So very happy with the chaos

Im so excited you posted <3
my comfort movie is back to the future
Try to find a witch u can trust and see if they can uncross you, you might have been hexed or sent the evil eye! If u cant find a witch then take a bath for 10 min with Epsom salt with the intention of cleaning urself, let it drain and imagine any negative or hex going down the drain. Either air dry or dry urself from head downward to toe
I love the fact that Garrett’s videos always seem like clickbait but he always actually attempts the task 😩😂

Garret dragging that mini skeleton on the ground was where I lost it.
keep the hairy madman look, it's fun! see just how covered in hair your body can get like it's a challenge and then trim it when it's too much like an overgrown lawn after the owners moved out and no one cared to help that little shack!
idk but he doesn't seem so happy in this vid ..... i hope it's not true because he deserve every good thing in the world he literally deserve to be happy forever like i would fight for his happiness idk how to describe how i feel

My comfort movie is Moana. I know it sounds dumb but it’s helped me to feel like I want to live after I have my emotional breakdowns. The animation is so beautiful, it reminds me just how amazing this planet is and I wanna be alive to see as much of this planet as I can.
Thank you for always being you! My comfort movie is Elf and any animated Disney movies 💕
As soon as garret mentioned inside era bo burnham I literally died bc it’s accurate as all hell

i live for garretts videos😭😭
Top two comfort movies are Mamma Mia 1 and 2 hands down, alongside Practical Magic, You've Got Mail, and The Holiday.
My comfort movie would either be Addams family values or harry potter and the prisoner of Azkaban(The best, visually, out of the whole series.😝).
7:32 … “are lobsters immortal” i just want to know the thought process
2:45 catalytic converters get stolen off vehicles all the time where im from 😭
My comfort movie is clueless or coralline
I have two comfort movies: Legally Blonde and Pride  The first being significantly more lighthearted than the second but they both make me feel better in different ways so yeah :)
are lobsters immortal
He seems a little more crazy than usual ngl
Garrett in this vid gives heavy shaggy and scooby vibes
I have only just started the vid, but I can only hope that Garrett comes up to the PNW and not only finds Sasquatch, but they fall in love, and live happily in the forest forever!!
someone stole my catalytic converter too! should i move to the woods?
My confort movie is Megamind :(
MY COMFORT MOVIE IS CORALINE AND IT HAS BEEN SINCE I WAS LIKE 4 YEARS OLD
My comfort movie is the Flintstones Viva Rock Vegas. I have no idea why, but I absolutely A D O R E it.
I don't understand why Garrett thinks he looks insane / ugly. I find him truly very attractive and the messy hair / beard is the cherry on top.
Wait 3.2 mil subs and he’s being melodramatic about a phone, fridge and a catalytic converter?
But are lobsters immortal?
No! Not hogwarts!! Im so sorry sweetie..that hurts my heart
Garrett with need more videos and get Andrew going with you sweet boyz adventures
I have the same plaid shirt as you 🤪
I love you so much..you always make me smile..i think we could talk for hours. My adhd makes me hard to tolerate for most bc i love talking about everything all at once that i have interests in..
Klamath Falls, OR Garrett! We’ve got the woods in every direction and Crater Lake just North.  Moved from LA to Klamath Falls and bought a house for under 200k.
Hey, watch any Samurai Champloo?
SOMEONE STOLE MY MOM'S CATALYTIC CONVERTER. It was at the mechanic and the shop got hit! Apparently it's been happening all over the country! Like wtf?!

Little Mermaid  or Grease 😅
My two comfort movies are Howls Moving Castle and The Craft 😅 similar but VERY different vibes LMAO
Hey Garrett my comfort movie is 'Family' staring Taylor schilling. I love it and I hope you do too:)
okay now listen.  twilight is a comfort movie and let me tell you why.  it isnt like! good! but theres something about the just. absolute silliness in a self indulgent teen girl vampire movie that hits something nostalgic and deep inside of me, and as a young teen girl growing up with a lot of sexuality confusion and dealing with rejecting femininity and girly things even now still considering my own gender, theres something about indulging in just a stupid silly teen girl vampire movie that just hits right.  hows moving castle is another big one, i dont even feel like i need to explain that.  but the last one isnt a movie, during fall my absolute favorite comfort things to watch is the over the garden wall series! its just so strange and weird and fun and nice to look at and watch and embodies so much of fall that i love.
I loved this video! You joy in the small things in life is just so wonderful! Ps. My comfort movie is Joe Dirt 😄
“are lobsters immortal” garrett is asking the real questions here
"I have decided to run away from everything" Garrett really out here doing what we all wish we could and showing us the reality over and over.
Once my cousin and i were on holiday at my grandparents house as kids and we buried a dead bee in a Barbie storage box in the yard and a few days later the box reappeared among the toys… i mean it could have been my grandmom digging it up again but we were sure the box reappeared because the bee became a zombie and dragged itself and the box out of the grave 🐝
I'm gonna answer garretts question like its my grade in class. My comfort movies include but are not limited too, Just Go With It feat. Adam Sandler and Jennifer Anniston, Tangled, The Maze Runner movies, Love Simon, and ALL but the last Harry Potter movies.
Yay I'm so glad you blessed us with a video! Love your content and personality 💛💙❤🧡💜💚 Benji so violent 😅😅😅😅
My comfort movies are Fantastic Mr. Fox and The Sound of Music
GARRETT thank you for the spooky vibes. 👻
Hello Dolly, Oklahoma, spirit, and Moana

I’m sorry someone stole your catalytic converter. That’s awful. I hope you get your fridge fixed and turn in this theft on your car insurance please. I have several comfy movies. Here’s just a few: Pretty in Pink, Wedding Singer, A Walk to Remember,  Bridesmaids, Some kind of Wonderful and currently watching John Tucker must die  and all episodes of Gilmore Girls. I watch every Fall with lots of apple cider. It hits just right. Take good care! 🐻 ⛺️
My comfort movie is strangely Z-O-M-B-I-E-S lol Its a dcom musical and it's so cheesy and fun to make fun of, but I love it. I'm legit a college student who's excited for the next one haha

Garrett can you please come back more. I don't know if most people serial watch YouTubers but I say you're all I got and that's all I got. Otherwise I'm just watching ghosts/cryptids caught on camera. I don't have other social accounts. I know I'm just a comment with no real body attached. But if this did mean something I would say I miss you and I would love if you came around more. You can be anything you want to be. Stay strong 💪 ❤
the tree falling effect almost gave me a heart attack 😭

Miss you so much! Would love to see you with the gang again too!!
lol me and my boyfriend have had some very interesting camping trips... one bein so windy it the top of the tent was on top of us because of the wind.... and that place was notorious for dead trees falling and stuff... i woke up to my boyfriend being like " how are you sleeping through this" we got the hell out of there... another time we were camping mid september i live in the midwest...it was thirty degrees we snuggled and made it the whole night, the other time we went and the campsite we went too the terrain was kinda soggy and wet so we found the driest spot and it started to pour so hard...same tent each time and we never got wet inside so it must be a good one lol.
This is a fantastic video Garrett! How fun was it to just go nowhere 😆 Thoroughly enjoyed this! My favorite comfort movie is The Fifth Element 😂
After this im just gonna binge watch his old videos lol
20:21 mini jumpscare warning  it actually made me jump little bit
Garrett is like a haunted house attraction. You’re imagination takes over, you might not even know where you are, but you know you’re safe & having lots of fun!
Yes going into the middle of nowhere alone wasn't the smartest of ideas...but it was so amazing to watch you go on the journey and have a bit of an ego-death from this lesson and remembering how much of the modern world you appreciate! I'm so grateful you made it out okay and that we are here to follow you through such a wild experience! We are always rooting for you Garrett! <3
My comfort movies are Deep Blue Sea and Naked Brothers Band movie 🥴
My comfort movie is Ella enchanted….
Major Into The Wild vibes, but it wasn't a happy end in Christopher's case.
Father of the bride part 1&2
Honestly my comfort movie is INSIDE<3
Dude you’re awesome! Follow your gut, be true to yourself, and see what happens!!  Also, you’re not alone with the whole “urge to run away into the woods for no reason” thing
My comfort movie is probably Dumb and Dumber
The mummy references SENT ME!!
Hi Garrett I have been wondering who you remind me of and I've figured it out. You are Cameron from Ferris Beullers Day Off. It's a compliment and I definitely think you should reconstruct some of the scenes. Have a great day.
i missed u
Are you ok??
coraline just hits like no other movie
My comfort movie always and forever will be devil wears Prada :)
My comfort movies have always been the Harry Potter series. I've seen them many, many times as well as gone to Universal Studios and I still love learning more and more about the universe.
my comfort movie is definitely howls moving castle, I can watch that movie so many times and not get sick of it.
Not a movie, but I always find myself rewatching Jenny Nicholson's "Spiderquest: Quest for the Man-sized spider" video and "The Last Bronycon: A Fandom Autopsy"  here on YouTube as comfort content. Thinking about it, you and Jenny actually have similar energy (she is maybe just less chaotic about it haha)
He should grow out his hair
Loving lumberjack Garrett
my comfort movies are definitely High School Musical and Harry Potter
I loove the video, but my question is, did you fix the fridge?
20:49
Monster House is definitely my comfort movie : )
Garret uploading on a bones day ☺️
Twilight is a comfort movie for me. 😐 I love making fun of it, yet the visuals & music are great, so… 🤷‍♀️ what are ya gonna do
OH my WORd GARRETT YOU BEAUTIFUL HUMAN. I love you and I want you to know you are abnormally normal. You're a unique and talented individual who is really loved and appreciated.  You are not losing your mind! You are just trying to live your best life while life may be crazy. I love your enthusiasm, energy and overall love for all things weird and different. Please continue having fun and being as "childish" as you want.
I don’t have a comfort movie but instead, my comfort SHOW is big mouth, I’ve rewatched it 3 times in the past few months
my comfort movie is kick ass. such middle school boy humor it’s not serious but the production is so good for a silly movie. love it.
Garrett you are precious and I hope to have a channel and personality half as charming as yours someday!
50 first dates is also my comfort movie!!! (and the wedding singer lol) <3
Garrett makes my heart full ❤️
Grown ups
Just watched it yesterday, my comfort movie is Fired Up!
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind or Pom Poko are the first to come to mind for comfort movies
Plot twist: the woman who cuts Garrett’s hair is Donna Klein. iykyk 😜
the spider burial genuinely made me emotional
so i married an axe murderer is my comfort movie
Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire is my comfort movie! 🧹
My comfort movie is Say Anything with John Cusack :-) <3
Garrett and I share the deep and feral desire to escape and live in the woods. I respect that.
I would have to say "Robin Hood; Men in Tights" I've seen that movie so, so many times. It was my first Mel Brooks movie, and I was like, 8 years old when it came out. It is the ultimate love letter to the 90"s, with so many jokes that younger people might not get today. But it has everything for me. The Medieval time period, romance, bad jokes, the constant ripping on Kevin Costner, and Carey Elwes post "The Princess Bride", but pre "Saw".
I run away to the woods when I'm overwhelmed, it's awesome.
those cookies (the ones with the butter knife) are so good.
Ow something bit my ass.- Garrett Watts

Garrett my comfort movie is definitely Lindsay's Lohan's Parent  Trap!!!
the vibes are amazing, love everything you do :) some of my favorite comfort movies/shows are: Ferris buellers day off, im thinking of ending things, monty python and the holy grail, community, parks and recreation, diary of a wimpy kid (all three movies), scott pilgrim vs the world, home alone (one and two), and so many more i could really go on for hours but im sure you have better things to do. i love you all, watch a movie, change the world x
My comfort movie is Little Women (the newest version)
I'm so so happy when you upload a video, you can do a video about how to take care of a stone and I'll enjoy watching it because I just love the energy that you put in everything you do..... Anyway, to answer your question, I think that my comfort movies are Harry Potter and the philosopher stone, Hocus pocus and stick it 😁
My Comfort movies are Nemo and Twilight rn
Garrett your explanation for all this is the end of the retrograde so your ass is going to be kicked time after time these past couple weeks up until today the last day of the retrograde tomorrow is the start of the new moon and a refresh so a lot of happiness and light should be coming your way. We’re going though this together! I’ve suffered more loss in the past week than I have in 5 years.
A skeleton in a bear costume I'd call a bearcrow. lol
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”

*~looks around quizzically~* “…WHElp I’ve done it…”, the way he said that fucking sent me. I love that Garrett can be absolutely hilarious just as his own silly self. Like, he could paint a wall and be so absolutely funny. In the least creepy way possible, I could watch you do anything and laugh. We love you!💕
I absolutely adore this! Every time I see Garrett my heart gets happy. Thank you for bringing some light into the world!
my comfort movie is 16 Candles starring the queen Molly Ringwald

I think my comfort movie is all the Harry Potter movies lol, I can always hibernate for 3 days straight to watch Harry Potter. But I also love Howl's Moving Castle, and Labyrinth sooooo much, I rewatch those constantly it feels like lol
Now you should try the opposite and go glamping.
Pitch perfect or night at the museum, they are truly top tier comfort movies.
This feels like a sign because my phone, computer and car all broke in the last week. 0.o
First it was the semi  truck edit. Now it's the tree falling edit. Garrett your junpscares hit me harder than actual scary movie jumpscares lol. Also my favorite comfort movies would have to be Bridesmaids and Identity Theif, my sisters and I always watch it when it comes on and always die laughing each time. Really any movie with Melissa McCarthy is top tier comedy 😂
Sound of Music, Mary Poppins, Steel Magnolias, My Cousin Vinny 🧡
My comfort movie is The Crow or Scream! And my comfort TV show is Hannibal >:)
my comfort movie is spirited away what a coincidence u mentioned it in this video
Bee movie or The never ending story ♥️
not him finding blood and dirt in his hair 😂
My comfort movie is look who’s talking. The whole plot is so easy to work out from the beginning, but me and my mum always watch it together when it’s on and it’s so easy to just have in the background.
I have so many comfort films, shrek, the hunchback of notre dam (and older Disney films like that), Forrest Gump, all harry potter movies, love actually 😅
Can we all agree to watch Garrett’s videos and not …his …video
your videos makes my day
Im 21 and Im still sleeping with my plush piggy from Ikea I got when I was 11. He has been saving me from many bad nights with anxiety and overthinking. Truly a good friend 🧸🥺
my comfort movie would have to be free birds😭
Any romcoms from the early 2000s 😂😭
YOURE BACCCK! i’ve missed you Garrett!
I was just thinking about you the other day hoping you'd post soon :) happy to see you're back again!!
Currently building a blanket fort to play camping with Garrett because there's no bears in my living room and I can watch youtube.
my comfort movie is Gone Girl
Garrett is the only famous person who makes a lot of money but that doesn’t change his life style or act like they have money
I truck lot just got hit bc they have precious metals platinum palladium and rhodium
*Hook* is definitely my comfort movie. I don't know what it is about it, but it's fantastic.
The beard is greattttttt yasssss
I really like the gay lumber jack look.. I think you look Really REALLY good with the full facial hair situation
My comfort movies are probably Beetlejuice and Her :,)
... That was most certainly a ride I went on and experienced as a real life human person....  My current comfort movie rn is Scream... I wish I could explain myself there but I got nothing.
Cry baby... Recently is been Hamilton. I guess so going for 2 hours makes me happy
my comfort movie is thor ragnarok:) i watch it at least weekly
My comfort movie is The Matrix, it's not my favourite movie, but i feel very comforted when i watch it, and i still don't understand any of it, i've watched it 15 times.
24:56 did anyone else see that??
A child tent seriously!? 😂
garrett is me in any minor inconvenience “god i need some grapes”😭😭 i love grapes
Mean girls !!
I’ve been waiting for youuuuuuuu
jokes aside my comfort movie is genuinely Ratatouille. We watched it a lot when i was a kid and every time Le Festin comes on in the movie with the lil cooking scene, my heart warms up. Very good movie 10/10
I will be honest when you joked about a tree falling on you and there was the noise and fake tree.. I may or may not have jumped a mile up out of my seat.
Garret you look great, I'm glad your getting away it's my dream to escape life and move out to the middle of nowhere.
Wall E. Wall E is my comfort movie just because it’s just like “Waaaaall E” “EeEEeve”
Moana is my all time comfort movie, that and Harry Potter ofc   Also Dr Who as an all time comfort series…
Mercury Retrograde hit the wrong person
Garret looks like Zeke Jaeger
My comfort movie is Mothman. Not the cheese one the one with Richard Gere. Use it to scare my self back in to reality. Its based on ture events .
I love watching Garrett lose his mind😂
The Labyrinth is my fav. comfort movie ;)
We missed you gear bear
No no, it’s understood about running away. Do you want a runaway buddy? My comfort movie is 30 days of night, spy, and the new world, not in any particular order but they do bring an immeasurable comfort into my life lol for whatever reason that they do lol
How has Garrett not stumbled upon a body yet? ::law and order sound::
Mine is Just Married with Brittany Murphy and Ashton Kutcher, watched it sooo many times. But probably watched Moulin Rouge as many times though. Actually going full on with a Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec costume for Halloween this year! 🎃🎃🎃
I’m getting Lorax vibes
My comfort movies are Harry Potter 1 or 2, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, Edward Scissorhands, or Santa Claus is Coming to Town.
Paul is my comfort movie 🍿
Did he check if there was an over the hedge sequel lmfaooo
Missed you Garrett! Loving the scruffy look 👀
garrett, I missed you with all of my heart
Lolol the dinosaur play tent surrounded by skeletons. Love it! 🎪 💀
My comfort move is Moana! I watch anytime after I have watched a scary movie so I am lulled to sleep my the sweet sounds of Lin Manuel Miranda's songs. It's put beautiful, calm imagery into my head and I can go to sleep without thinking about demons, vampires or Monsignor Pruitt attacking me.✨
being agnostic is the bisexual of spiritualities and i should know cuz im both lol
"Saved!" with Mandy Moore and Jenna Malone <3
We love lumber-garrett
Hi Garrett! You are supposed to turn off your fridge for a whole day once a year.. to defrost. Try this an it will work the next day ☺️
I have never related more to Garrett than I have in this video. Big mood bud
Garrett having a Walden by Henery David Thoreau moment
definitely the harry potter films, my neighbor totoro, and kiki's delivery service
THIS WEEK. I’m literally driving myself crazy stuck between moving to LA or SF. I got into two different great schools and need to decide, I’ll take your advice as a vote. “if you’re thinking of moving to LA, DONT!”
🖤🖤🖤
Your so adorable
my comfort movies are howl's moving castle and also tangled because i'm just a child apparenty <3

My comfort movie would definitely be Mrs.Doubtfire for sure
Labrynth, no matter how creepy it gets, and Sargent Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band because its so bad its good then it goes back to being bad again-
My friends and I all agree that if we are having a bad time, that we need to just sit down and watch Mamma Mia. You can't have a bad time watching Mamma Mia.
U literally make my day garrett love your videos you make me giggle n your the best I can’t wait for next video u brighten my day never change your awesome 😎 🙌🙌
I know you probably don’t know Dan and Phil, but I think it’d be cool if you could one day collab with them, especially AmazingPhil. Maybe some spooky content or something. I know they’ve got some weird ghost stories they’ve mentioned in now quite old livestreams. Idk but that could be fun to do in future maybe
some of my comfort movies are greatest showman and all the harry potter movies
My comfort movie is for sure Fried Green Tomatoes
school of rock, emperors new groove, saw and nightmare on elm street 1-4
i dont have a comfort movie but two comfort series: the good place and brooklynn 99
Anyone know what happened to the sweet boys podcast??
My comfort movies are the Princess Bride and Pinapple express 😂
I see even garrett is feeling the retrograde
a comfort film of mine is my neighbour totoro, or spirited away ngl
I don't really have a comfort 'movie' more than I'm autistic and have special interest movies. Any of the Avengers films, but especially the first one. Harry Potter movies, especially Goblet Of Fire, but also shows like the BBC adaptation of Sherlock or the Doctor Who reboot from 2005. My favourites for those are A Sign of Three, The Reichenbach Fall or The Empty Hearse for Sherlock, or any Matt Smith episode. I also like David Tennant when he's with Donna Noble. Anyway that's my nerd rant over
can garret get any more random? of course yes
I full body jumped  20:22
Comfort movie: easily the 1995 version of sense and sensibility. So good. On another note, the other day I walked 12 miles into the woods away from my house, and then had to find my way back in the dark. I listened to Fiona Apple the whole time, and it was probably the best I’ve felt this whole year. I absolutely do recommend.
UMMMM CAN WE STOP WITH THE DEATH EDITS the tree falling and truck hit last time gave me chest pain omg hahahaha
"Into the wild" a sequel
Ooo my comfort movie has got to be the 1984 Ghostbusters, I watched it so many times as a child
my comfort movies are Matilda and Anastasia I LOVE those movies
OMG COMFORT MOVIE : mean girls, high-school musical (all 3), scream, and venom. I have a-lot i really like movies.
Man, I wish we could be friends and hang out together :(
Hi Garrett! My top three comfort movies are Labyrinth, Coraline, and Alice in Wonderland (1951). And yes I realize they're all about a girl entering an alternate universe, I'm all for the literal escapism.
Not a movie but a cartoon. I laughed so much watching Amazing World Of Gumball when I was younger ;w;
I have missed you soooo incredibly much. Your videos just make me so happy. Thankyou garrett.  Rip daddy long legs 😖🕷
10 things I hate about you and Dracula (with Winona Ryder and Gary oldman)
24:54 wtf is that light moving behind Garrett lmao
Ratatouille, I will watch that movie literally any day, anytime
Yayyyyyy Garrett's back!😍😍😍 My sunday has just been made perfect
garrett is my spirit animal
Gotta love spooky season! 🎃👻
My comfort movie is the Muppets Treasure Island. Great nostalgic movie to turn off brain and give serotonin
The anxiety I get from these videos is equally fun and frustrating and I wouldn’t have it any other way! 😻
My comfort movie is Coraline
Wow Garrett a digging this brawny man look going here
Garrett will have the craziest stories to tell as a uncle
i have the same urge to do so all the time but we don't have a "woods" here so my plan is to have money travel somewhere and then leave everything and live alone in the woods beside a river and when im bored ill go inside the cave thats behind the waterfall and try to do some kungfu stuff
My comfort movie is either spirited away or kill bill (both volumes)
My comfort movie is Little Women with Winona Ryder.
I needed this video SEW much! ❤️❤️❤️ Oh Garrett, I never noticed how cute your nose is.
This 6’4 disheveled hyper man has my heart
This has Michael Scott x Kelly Kapoor energy.
I think the lesson learned here was that sometimes we have to do stuff out of our comfort zone to appriciate what we have in life. And all of us soemtimes wants to just quit everything and escape, but this makes you realise that you just feel overhelmed with reality, but it is your place and just take it easy, take care of your stuff and yourself. Also my comfort movie is Mary and Max, it’s so amazing. But the first Harry Potter movie as well for sure!
comfort movie? warm bodies
My comfort videos are the nightmare before Christmas and Sweeney todd x
My comfort movies are princess diaries ( watched it ever since i was 5 ) or any tim burton film 🎃🎃🎃

About the question at the end, my comfort movie would have to be Uptown Girls. There's just something sweet about it.
I had a bathroom window spider named Roger, and after months of friendship, he died and left behind an egg sack. Not gunna lie, I wasn’t too stocked about the egg sack, but I get it. Anyways, bathroom window spiders are nice.
100% my comfort movie is Drop Dead Fred, I love Rik Mayall with all my heart and I miss him dearly. 😔 Also just any spy movie. Love me some espionage!
My confort movie is the first Harry Potter movie, I suffer from migraines and it play it soflty when I lock myself in the dark so that it goes away. It's real comforting just to know the plot and don't have to be paying attention to it. Hope you have a nice day
Omg my comfort movies are Pocahontas and Baby Driver 🎃
my comfort movie is hands down Mamma Mia
I love how in the end all Garrett needed was Taco Bell. Now that is the true lesson of the day. 😌✨👌🏾

Comfort movie #1 has forever been Ratatouille 🐭
I have a cabinet of dead things too, aww yeah, relatable ^_^
Is this the Blair witch 3
I Love how every video that Garrett posted is always a half hour, or an hour
This feels like that show from discovery channel where that bald guy w an accent is left in the middle of nowhere and has to find civilization again…. Except Garret has absolutely no base knowledge or survival skills.
This video lacks one (1) Andrew
My comfort movie might be Coraline <3

I feel so nostalgic whenever Garrett brings Benjamin out cause I remember him buying that baby for a video ahhh

Oh and definitly Miss Peregrine's House For Peculiar Children too! I love that so muchhhhh, and tbh Mrs. Doubtfire is also one of my comfort movies, I can talk for hours about movies so imma shut up now lol, but thank u for the vid Garrett! <3

50 first dates for me too and good dinosaur, 8 crazy nights, who framed Rodger rabbit, hot chick, and the big Lebowski.
I also have a teddy bear...except, he's the one my dad bought the day I was born. Does he count as an adult teddy bear lmao? 🤣
Comfort movie. Garrett I swear....ya ready? The Lord Of The Tings trilogy and Gone With The Wind Love you!! Glad you're safe.
I’ve been having really bad nightmares too lately.
My comfort movie is grown ups, it always makes me feel happy 😃
Imagine having Garrett as your friend and losing him.
“are lobsters immortal” at least we know garrett’s asking the real questions around here.
Avengers: Endgame is definitely my comfort movie because of the particular scene where everyone pulls up to the big battle against Thanos at the end and Captain America says “AVENGERS!..Assemble” and both sides clash. Every time I watch that I almost cry out of pure joy because I’ve been wanting to see a bunch of Marvel characters be in one movie since Spider-Man 3 with Tobey Maguire seeing two villains in the same movie
Strange magic is the comfort movie that I go to often. Love your content Garrett, your always a light in the darkness lol <3
Garrett you should go into the woods with andrew with more stuff and be more prepared. itll be fun

Mother fuckin tree made me SCREAM AND IM AT WORK!!!!!!
Garrett I feel like your entire existence is how my brain works but I keep screaming at it to shut the hell up to keep it from doing the crazy things it wants to do and I kind of love you for that, but part of me kind of wants to take care of you cuz I worry about you sometimes.   As far as comfort movie it has always and will always be Little Shop of Horror which is the movie that I developed my intense crush for Rick Moranis watching as well as fell in love with Ellen Green's singing voice.
i love the attention to detail he put on his recent thumbnails <3 the broken glass effect on his glasses is so cool!!
I'm so relieved Garrett didn't get shot in the woods. Gun laws in America are scarier then the bears.

Whisper of the Heart is really important to me as a movie, it never fails to inspire a warmth in me in spite of the fear and anxiety it relates to me with - believing you're "good enough" at anything you love is a struggle we might never overcome but we can try and it's worth it
Your videos never disappoint I love you
my comfort movies vary from the maze runner,  to bolt, to thor ragnarok lmao

No wonder people think there's cults doing rituals in the Forrests. The shot when burying your window friend, if I walked in on that would 100% believe I was about to be sacrificed lmao.
I'm in the into and Garrett I must agree. It's so lovley seeing your face. I was at work the other day hoping you'd drop another video soon, and here you are. Thank you friend.

Garrett announcing “IM DOING FINE” with forced enthusiasm and panic in his eyes is a whole gd mood
I would buy “I thought this was a good idea but I’ve actually learned that it was very shitty” merch hoodies in every color
I probably would have set up the lil tent in the back of the car
Comfort movies include The Labyrinth, Rocketman, The Breakfast Club, The Truman Show, and oddly enough (this isn’t a movie but oh well) the NBC’s tv show Hannibal. Every time I put that show on I feel the urge to take a nap and relax 😭🤚🏻
my comfort movie is bridge of therabithia, mostly cause i had a huge crush for zoey deschanel but also for josh hutcherson... but it also had a dark turn for a movie for kids  idk why it comforts me so much till this day.
A league of their own with Tom hanks is mine
My comfort movie has to be the disney classics. Something animated and with a familiar story line, princess gets saved and the villain is defeated.

I don't have a comfort movie but American Horror Story Freakshow is my security blanket. If I have a hard day or am very anxious at night, I put it on & instantly I feel soothed. I can't explain how much it means to me.

Anton Levay ring?
YES!!!
comfort movies ; house, juno (even if I violently cry to it), submarine, and rocky horror
Unpopular opinion: but I think it’s so much more special to get content sporadically rather than daily/weekly habitual uploading. That long awaited content just hits different. Feels so special >•<
Um. This was one of my favourites. Thank you 😊 The spider burial was so damn cute
"man found dead surrounded by Halloween decorations in northern California woods"

Garrett......
currently wondering how garrett made it home without a phone
Thank you for snapping me out of a terrifying spiral. 🖤
GARRETT IS ALIVE.  My comfort movies are Moana, Nightmare before Christmas, and Halloween Town.
That spider didn’t know it, but he was loved, and that is honestly the most beautiful thing. You honored his life by giving him a proper burial and headstone 😭 Garrett you are truly the most beautiful soul. You are so compassionate and loving and I love you so much!!
Southern California is a dessert, garret 😭💗
edward scissor hands is a good comfort movie, and so is any scooby doo movie
Garret thinking its a sign to leave his house me "Which black cat did you piss off"
i love teaching bear self defense while leaving a trail of food on the ground that leads straight to you
When I'm feeling down I really enjoy a dark psychological movie...like shutter Island, inception, Sweeney Todd...I honestly tend to use TV shows to make me feel better. Like the British Baking show, the office, star trek TNG, or literally any murder mystery series!
It’s so weird to think I have watched garret since I was in elementary school and now I’m in high school
My comfort movies are ponyo with a hot drink or howl's moving castle with popcorn and a load of tissues for when I cry over the soundtrack
shrek 2
"I'll just die and see what happens.. lol" 🤣🤣🤣
that seems horrifying 😭
The new Grinch animated movie I watch it all the time. Deadpool 1&2 rlly helped me a lot when they came out, so they are always a backup one, puss in boots is my all time fave
diary of a wimpy kid or the first Pirates of the Caribbean are both such comfort movies to me idk why they've just always made me super happy
hi
Hmm my comfort movies are 1. Jimmy Neutron boy Genius 2. Home 3. Lilo & stitch and or Monster inc 4. Spirit stallion of the Cimarron
Oh my goo googly goo....you are speaking my language of running away. Not in a span of a week but over 3 weeks, my life has been in total chaos and just trying to make sense of any of it has been a total shitshow. It's gotten to the point where I just wake up and wonder "what circus am I waking up to, today?" But this helped me, immensely, and I haven't laughed that hard in a while when you whipped yourself (hope you're okay) but my brother did that to himself many many years ago. So the memory was welcomed. But my favorite comfort movie is "Little Miss Sunshine". Happy you didn't die.
My comfort movies are Coraline and The Addams Family
my comfort movie is sky high….👀
It sounds like Mercury retrograde hit you hard boi! It’s almost over.
I knew Garrett would upload on a bones day ❤️

My comfort movie is Luca :)
I'm only five minutes in and I'm pretty sure this is my favorite video you've made. No cut backs to a little baby even though that's cite that you like little things but this was just easier for me to watch (someone who is easily lost and distracted)
My head hurts
*The urge to leave & go in the woods... literally me for years now*
I have so many comfort movies omg but I think my top three are Meet the Robinsons, Flipped and 27 dresses

My comfort movie is Christmas with the Kranks. Christmas movies fix everything
Goonies or the Fifth Element are my comfort movies
I love Garret
Howl’s moving castle has been my comfort movie for a few years now, it’s my go-to dvd when the internet’s out
I DISAGREE, THE FIRST MUMMY IS MY COMFORT MOVIE AND THE VIBE IS IMMACULATE, GARRETT WATTS!!!!!!
my comfort movie is coco also! funny thing I was typing coco right as you said coco and ii laughed at the coincidence lol
my comfort movies are the original Star Wars movies!!!
you should put your skellie in the car when not in use
I LOVE 50 First Dates, too! Coco is one of my nephew’s favorite movies! Loved the energy of this video!   I’ve been wanting to just take off and drive further north (already live ~60 mi N of LA off the 101) with no direction, but I got to live vicariously through this video instead!
This sounds really weird but the Halloween Town movie series gives me comfort. It just reminds me of good times at home with my mom and sister -- and just feeling safe and warm as we ate pillowcases and bowls full of candy. I could seriously watch it anytime of year.
YAAAAAY DAD’S BACK
They stole my moms cat converter also last month here in Texas! 😧 hope they fix your car soon Garrett!!
WOW!!! (first time here) why do I feel exhausted after watching this man?
Yaaasss teddy bears for the win!! Still have mine, def great to have a sleep buddy; pets fill that role amazing too
"Gotcha Bitch!" :)
You sent the bone photos to Caitlin Doughty didn't you?
I’ve always had a problem with letting myself feel my feelings so my comfort movies are The Mask with Jim Carey cause I used to watch it everyday after school when I was a kid (random I know) and the movie My Girl because it makes me cry and sometimes you just gotta cry😬😂
25:04 uh no fuck that. That is straight out of the blair witch game stop playing
my comfort movie is definitely labyrinth!! david bowies pants make me feel safe
Garrett looks good with a beard and adorable with his long hair
corpse bride or the first live action scooby doo
fantastic mr. fox is my comfort movie !
My and my partners comfort movie is pitch perfect. We can both watch it every day and feel so good every time.
My comfort movie is the first mummy movie with Brendan Fraser 🍿🎥
Garrett you look so hot!!!
As someone who lives in the woods in California you are the most unprepared person to ever go to the woods😂
My comfort movie is the wedding singer! Also, RIP bathroom spider 🙏🏼
"Are lobsters immortal?"
I absolutely love “singing in the rain” and “the Labyrinth”
I love seeing casual videos of what Garrett is thinking, and then him acting on those random fun ideas, it makes me feel comforted, like talking to a chaotic loving friend <3
My comfort movies (because we could never have one..) are the Twilight movies and The Sandlot 🤣
Garrett, you have no business being this funny! 😂 Your uploads bring me joy. 💕
Oh Garrett my sweet man. I’ve missed you.
If I'm sick, my comfort movie is You've Got Mail - because I always watched it while home sick with the flu as a kid If I'm sad, my comfort movie is Drop Dead Fred - because it makes me so happy and I laugh so much, but its got a great moment to have a big old cry in
As soon as I saw the actual “tent” I said Back to the Jeep!! I would have just slept in there.
the tent rlly got me - also the princess bride is for sure a comfort movie
This is pure chaos lmfaooo
Garret, I live in the woods and I'm talking  in the middle of nowhere. The fact that you did this in California while, I'm pretty sure is the time of year where bears fatten up for winter, is amazing to me.
omg my fridge stopped working last week too! and seriously the freezer still worked...such a pain to have to throw all the fridge stuff out and/or cram it all in the freezer so as not to keep throwing stuff out.
Jump to 19:00 to get to the video topic. It’s still garbage after that point, though.
Those woods look like where The Hunt could have been shot
Happy Gilmore, Dumb and Dumber
I was never very religious growing up, I was never molded into a certain religion. About 6 or 7 years ago is when I learned about being Agnostic. I’m so glad I did and have defined myself as so ever since.
2:26 garret sounded like shaggy when he said "that's a sign too" 😂
My comfort movie is Just Friends with Ryan Reynolds, Amy Smart and Anna Faris. I love this movie to unhealthy lengths, so much so that my closest friend hired a Ryan Reynolds voice actor to send me a Happy Birthday message with lots of Just Friends movie quotes peppered through. Seriously, this movie is one I watch all year round (even though it's a chrismtas movie) and I take it everytime I go camping because when I'm out there in the wild (aka standard camp sites), it keeps me and my lovely partner entertained and comforted. It's the best b-grade xmas movie with the most halirious overdubbed little sound effects hehehe IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THIS MOVIE GARRETT, GET ON IT NOW BECAUSE YOU WILL LOVE IT! (i hope) xx
I'm very happy that you indeed were not eaten by a bear (or zombie) out there garrett. My comfort movies are Fern Gully and the Nightmare Before Christmas. Both are so nostalgic for me and just make me feel great 😄
My comfort movie is ponyo <3
Defrost your fridge. 😉
Wow I needed this ‘run off to the woods because the modern world is overwhelming you’ content for the reminder that it’s not an answer. I loved the moral of this video, thanks for sharing.
Was I the only person in these comments… who was literally concerned about Garrett and his mental health and being alone…in a no trespassing forest. Garrett when your head started bleeding I got ✨worried✨
You're just such a wonderful person.
My comfort movie, or movies rather, is the entire Harry Potter series or LoTr trilogy.
Can we PLEASE get Garrett to #1 trending??
Does Garrett know he has ADHD?
Nope.
my comfort movies are obvs harry potter, marvel movies, and probs any disney movie ever
I’ve never related more to a human 🤣🤣
The fact that you like Erykah Badu made me love you even more
my comfort movie in college was Daddy’s Home 2 and The Hot Chick, now I have more of a comfort show and it’s Wizards of Waverly Place
I was a little concerned because cougars. my comfort movie is The Goonies.
My comfort movie is School of Rock! Gosh it just takes me back to the happiest parts of my childhood. Also the scene where Mr. S & Tamika are talking about weight AH just resonates with me to this day.
My comfort movies are rise of the guardians and tangled, and on occasion, princess and the frog
The rescuers! Old Disney movie , but I love it!
My comfort movie is the parent trap with Lindsay Lohan cause that's a classic !
My okay honestly my comfort movies are all older— some more basic than others. 10 Things I hate about you, the original karate kid, back to the future, and probably my favorite one right now is some kind of wonderful, ahhh young Eric Stoltz 🥰
My comfort movie would probably be Deadpool (as ridiculous as that may sound lol) and tangled. What a combination 😅 I just can put either of those on and forget about whatever else is going on and they simply bring back happier memories.
tiny lupin in the background 👀
Life Aquatic is definitely my comfort movie. its such a good reminder of my childhood and brings me back to nice memories.
Thank you for being you💓💓💓
That “something” is mercury retrograde 😂😂😂😂😂
Even though you specified that it was for children, I was not prepared for how small that tent is. I also wasn't prepared for you to be able to fit inside it. Holy crap lol.  I have so many things I want to scold you about, but I think you've already figured all of 'em out the hard way. Rest up and I hope your luck improves! R.I.P. Bathroom spider. :(  Edit: I don't have a comfort movie, but my comfort game is Okami...and Jump Force.
Can you imagine Garrett bulky? I can lol
Garret. You are literally my spirit animal. If you’ve not watched the show about Mick dodge you’re missing out. Same it’s a fight not to run off in the woods and live in nature however your video was a good reminder that maybe I shouldn’t😂 I should just stick to tent camping. Also! 50 first dates, Jurassic park trilogy, Harry Potter, sappy love movies or any cartoon all are comforting to me😂 I swear we have the same mind and I love it😂 putting your skeleton in your pool as a security system is something I totally would do! Also burying the window spider (may they rip) is me. I love it when you upload! Never feel bad for having an adult stuffed animal! They can be so comforting and aren’t for a specific age. I hope you’re doing well. Thank you for creating your videos as a safe space for all of us! I pray your life is filled with happiness and peace! I am praying for you! Know you’re loved and you matter! Have a great rest of your year. Know you’re never alone!  I pray God wraps you and your family (whether blood or chosen) and loved ones all in a hedge or protection! I pray you all have good health! This goes to everyone who may be reading this. God bless you! #GodSavesAndLovesAll🙌😭❤️🙌
Garrett: “my fridge is broken and my food is rotting” Also Garrett: *takes out can of whipped cream and squirts in mouth* 😂😭

My comfort movie is definitely Coraline or Over The Garden Wall (if that even counts as a movie)
That thumbnail looking like a new movie I want to watch.
Bee and PuppyCat is my comfort show :) Also RIP to bathroom spider 🪦✨
I have a couple comfort movies but my top ones would have to be the parent trap, hannah Montana the movie, the prisoner of Azkaban, and twilight!
Wait Garret why’d you search ‘ are lobsters immortal’ 💀💀
I never really thought of it before, but I guess my comfort movie would be Bridget Jones.
I love how many studio ghibli answers I see for comfort movies. ❤️❤️

This video cemented my crush on Garrett

Fantastic Mr Fox is one of my favourite movies for comfort! thank you for asking :)
Your videos are my comfort movies!
Omg mines coco too!!!!
Are you agnostic, or a gnostic? Because I think we're operating on opposing definitions. Gnostic means 'to know', so agnostic means not knowing. An agnostic just has the mindset that we can't possibly know some things, but is not opposed to accepting something should truth arise.   Unless you mean you are an agnostic theist, rather than the type of atheist it tends to describe. I'll admit, I haven't run across many agnostic theists. I wonder if that would be someone who does not know if something doesn't exist...? Like, ghosts have no been definitively proven or disproven, so you'll believe until proven otherwise...? Interesting.  As for comfort movies, hmmmm... Howl's Moving Castle? Labyrinth? Inception? Tangled? I'm not sure. Honestly, I'm more likely to rewatch an entire series again like Galavant, Gravity Falls, Noragami, Higashi no Eden, Flying Witch, Yuri on Ice, Firefly, the first six season of Supernatural... Something I know very well and can just let cocoon me without paying much thought, droning on in the background.
Aristocats!!!
Not even kidding, you said this wasn't that good of a video idea but even if you posted things like this all the time I would 100% still watch and so would so many others.  I love your personality and you are way more relatable than most big name Youtubers honestly.
im going camping tomorrow n this made me so excited
Okay, comfort movies. Yes. We got The Maze Runner (1st one), Minor Details, Love and Monsters, Venom, and sometimes American Assassin. And I think now that I just watched it, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
watching Mamma Mia is like having a pleasant conversation with your best friend's mom at a childhood sleepover while said best friend's in the bathroom. that's absolutely my comfort movie.
Not a movie but my comfort show is Agents of SHIELD bc it’s just so perfect and I have rewatched it so many times I’ve lost count lol
What did I click on? No update on the Honey Badger?
the way you do your videos has progressively started feeling like a book of your adventures it’s entertaining
My comfort movie is Booksmart and most recently Luca, I watched it like 5 times in the last month
i love your videos it feels so refreshing
My comfort movie is definitely “while you were sleeping” even though it’s kind of a Christmas movie it’s still the best and I can watch it anytime of the year😂
Finding Nemo All the Tinkerbell movies 😏😏
I wish I could remember what a comfort movie is to me. Could be the men in black 1 and 2. Idiocracy.  Matilda. Goodfellas.
My comfort movie is Corpse Bride or Tangled or Lilo and Stitch depends on why I need to be comforted lol
I’m ready for the “is Garrett okay?” videos

My safe movie is zombieland
OMG DO THE SKELETONS HAVE NAMES? WHERE DID YOU GET THEM?!?
Garret is such a bright, beautiful, strange amalgamation of everything good and honest in this world.

I was so worried Garrett was gonna start a fire because it's fire season... but then I saw all the spooky stuff 😭
My comfort movie is Marie Antoinette with Kristen Dunst 💖
I am watching this video on treadmill and shooked since I can jog for 30+ minutes lol 🤣
My comfort movies are beetlejuice, frozen, tangled, def howls moving castle and a whisper away and poppy from up on the hill
I’m glad passive aggressive whine lady wasn’t in this video, she always makes me sad
Garret we need you alive you are a national treasure ✌🏻🖤🌈 my comfort movies: Footloose, Madagascar in Spanish 🧚🏻‍♀️ first and second seasons of HBO Girls and Sex and the city ❤️
Garrett's collar bone was very distracting. Good video! Comfort movie is definitely Silence of the Lambs.
PRINCESS BRIDE is my ultimate comfort movie. I watch it when im sad and happy and depressed and sick and excited. all the time. makes me feel like I'm being hugged by my momma while drinking orange chamomile tea.
i thought garrett looked like an adorable lumberjack <3
Our boy is not prepared at all. No water, sleeping bag, more proper amount of food. Good luck! Lol
MONSTER IN LAW and the harry potters and all lotr. and also princess mononoke!! and fight club. and halloween town!
I love garret,but sometimes he is just so messy
i love action movies and very plot heavy movies which is why my comfort movie is    the breakfast club yep, the breakfast club, a movie that came out before i was born.
I'm watching this but not watching Shane's new vid 😳
the harry potter films are definitely big comfort films for me too <3

My comfort movie is unironically Shrek the Musicial

I've always wanted a whip but i kinda forget i want one until I see someone else with one and im like oh yah, I want one.
That spider was a daddy! And had quite long legs!!! However he was not a daddy long leg Garrett :,(
My partners comfort movie is Moana and mine is probably the Cat Returns or really any Ghibli movie
what the f*ck did i just watch😂😂😂 the chaotic energy is killing me hahaha
My comfort movie is Scott pilgrim vs the world/ chick fight. Also your a comfort to me... So-
Comfort movie would have to be Pride and Prejudice (2005) honestly, also have read the book at least 20 times I think.
drive away from the ocean, you will run into some woods at some point
I want to say literally just drive twords the woods, dont see any? Drive until you do. Bing bang boom there yah go lol
This is make wholesome.

Not a movie but my comfort show is Frasier!
coraline et harry potter !
Ahhhhha i love Bo Burnham thanks for  refreshing my memory on that 👌
The Holiday is 1000% my comfort movie! I watched it once when I had the first ever hardship in my first relationship and ever since then, it’s my go to to find my inner peace
As a gal who goes solo primitive camping often, the packing sequence in this video filled me with SO much anxiety it’s hard to explain. I go out in the woods *with* actual supplies and I still get scared and cold as shit on occasion 😂
You are such a pure soul and I think my comfort movie is Big Hero 6…I really wish Baymax was real
my comfort movie? fantastic mr fox
he booked a haircut but it got rescheduled
maybe better help should be your sponsor instead of skillshare... much love!
As a little kid my comfort movie was the jetlag productions cinderella, the very terrible Cinderella remake purchasable, I’m pretty sure, only at wal-mart. As an adult it might be Klaus, that movie makes my heart so happy.
The pool skeleton needs to live in the Prius from now on. Scare the catalytic converter thieves.
Garrett I love you SO much, my best friend and I watch you every time we hang out and we absolutely love you. Thank you for being so cool
killer clowns from outer space 😌
My comfort movie would have to be Nightmare Before Christmas. I don't really know why, its not like I grew up with it, I just tend to find comfort in the movie, and Hocus Pocus. If its not obvious I adore spooky season :)
Garret, why are you looking like Zeke Jeager? i'm not complanning tho
My comfort movie is actually 8 mile.
My comfort movies are definitely all of the studio ghibli movies 💕
This is my first Garrett Watts video ever, I'm halfway through, and I have to say this is the most adorable + chaotic shit I've ever witnessed and I'm living for it.
Oooh, my comfort movies are probably “dead poets society” or “ghostbusters “, I’ve watched them like a trillion times, definitely recommend both
I'm shocked Garrett actually fit in that little tent lol
Honestly, big dayyy by Adam Sandler
Oh Garrett, I wish you would've been a little more prepared 😆 like bringing more water, a proper tent and sleeping bag. Well I'm sure you learned a lot from this!
I suppose my comfort movie is more of a series? The 10th Kingdom! I love it so SO much! It actually kind of scared me the first time I saw it, I was like 5 or 6, but I watch it when I feel sad, need a mental boost, just want to chill or if I haven't seen it in a while :)
I love ur beard <3 Garrett don't be afraid to let there be a pause between talking clips because sometimes it be a lot for my brain.. p.s. my comfort movie is twilight LMAOO I've seen it too many times ez sad

Me and my friend used to always joke the reason why Garretts uploads are so far apart is because he's out in the woods, probably trying to befriend all the woodland animals or just vibing and well......I guess we were kinda right lol
garrett calling that female doe a male deer is the best part of my day
MY COMFORT MOVIE IS VENOM!!! also as someone who has fantasized about packing up and leaving the modern world to live alone and isolated in the wilderness, i rlly appreciated the ending perspective that you shared :-) maybe the modern world would be more fun if i lived it a different way, and i actually dealt with problems rather than actively trying to avoid them <3 as always, love you garrett, thanks for being one of my favorite ppl of all time :D
Garrett, have you heard of the recent Mercury in Retrograde? 🤔
Really glad nobody stole the cat converter off your adventure car while you were shivering in the dino tent! And Benjamin scared me behind that log, little stinker!

I have soooo many comfort movies lol but my top 2 gotta be The Wedding Singer & Coraline, I can seriously watch them everyday

Are lobsters immortal?
Into the woods or forests
kiki's delivery service... i don't know why but it makes me happy every time i watch it <3
I'm scared for Garrett he's got to be one of the most courageous men ever because it takes a lot of confidence to be all by yourself in the woods. Holy crap I couldn't do it
its not only LA garrett mine was stolen too and its happening a lot in this area in NY dude it fucking sucks I was pissed
My comfort movie is coraline ... not very comforting but 🤷‍♀️
Too funny lol. I’m camping right now in my backyard. I’m learning bushcraft and I’m 70. Just do it. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
sisterhood of the traveling pants. either one
Comfort movie? The Dark Knight and Jaws (The Original). They wouldn't seem comforting to most, but they just feel like home.
Cars for sure
All three Mr. Bean movies.
My comfort movie is very obscure and not many people know about it or have watched it. I really like Mandie and the Secret Tunnel and Mandie and the Cherokee Treasure. Idk. They give me a lot of comfort. I just stumbled upon them and have watched them many times.
Little Women (1994) is my comfort movie
Garrett you should come to Flagstaff, Arizona! It’s gorgeous and spooky, and you would love it!!
For some reason, when I was a kid and stayed home sick from school, my go to comfort movie was The Master Of Disguise 🐢 🐢
my comfort movie is frozen II. I listen to the soundtrack when I'm away from home and get anxious. I'm 22 and it's slightly embarrassing, but  I love that movie so much
It not a comfort movie but law and order: SVU
Oh yeah also now I want taco bell 😂
Serendipity is my comfort movie and its free to watch on YouTube movies! Also thank you for the laughs I really need it 🥰🥰🥰
Things
The 1998 live action Madeline movie is a comfort of mine, OH and the live action 101 Dalmatians, and The Princess Diaries C:
This reminds me of the episode where Michael Scott runs off into the woods  My comfort movie would have to be the Harry Potter movies and Twilight. I get it I’m basic
You ran away and forgot me!
howls moving castle for sure or grown ups, it’s rlly a huge difference LMAO
22:02 did anyone else hear shaggy (from scooby doo) laugh from Garrett?
Spider Burial montage was like a Wes Anderson movie.
Were the noises in the woods edited in or were those real noises? Because it sounded like a bear to me and I would’ve noped out of there so fast 💨
no one: garrett every 3 seconds: 😟😛ÆÜEH🤪
My comfort movie is either fantastic mr fox or perks of being a wallflower or breakfast club or Indiana jones
My comfort movie is a new hope from Star Wars. And a series is rebels, got me through my first month of college
Paddington and Howl’s Moving Castle and Fantastic Mr Fox and Any of your videos :)) love ya
This is the equivalent to the cottagecore lesbian dream of running away to cottages and raising cats and growing strawberries to get away from society and capitalism :o
Me: watching Garrett puts around in the forest without his stuff very concerned about him losing daylight
His nervous laughter gets me every time 😭
Hey Garrett! It’s an awesome day whenever you post, I love your Videos! They bring me a lot of peace in my stressful life! Thank you!
My comfort movies are: Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind  Hallmarks 1990s live action Alice in Wonderland  Repo! The Gentetic Opera  And lastly, House of 1,000 Corpses

This video is a MOOD!!!
Love You Garret!!! Thanks for the how to go camping in the woods video !! Now I feel I can actually accomplish something!
Just a weird me too moment (kinda) , my catalytic converter needs to be replaced (exhaust leaking into it). Luckily no one stole it but I feel your pain. $1000 repair 🤦‍♀️
ohh comfort films? WELL - st trinians, nanny mcphee, hairspray and bill remain my absolute favourite films to watch when i just need something fun and happy!!
This is how true crime stories start.. js
My comfort movie is Cruella (2021) :-)
This is going to sound really weird but one of my comfort movies is the first Back to The Future movie. You just can’t go wrong with a 80s classic!! Michael J Fox is just truly an icon
pitch perfect is my comfort movie
the fact that I didn’t even have to THINK about this answer😂 in no particular order.. 1) every Harry Potter movie (Deathly Hallows Part 1 is my fave) 2) The Devil Wears Prada 3) The Lizzie McGuire Movie
My comfort movie is Jennifer’s Body
I know a manic episode when I see one
My confort movie is def either bolt or nightmare before christmas! I watched them both so much growing up that they let me just detach myself from whatever task i have burned into my brain
LETS GOOOOO! Girl I feel u I want to run into the woods like 3x a day and just vibe
Idc what anyone says, garret with a beard is everything I need.
don't worry, y'all! Seattle *also* has had a ridiculous uptick in catalytic converter theft! I woke at 4am last Tuesday by the sounds of my neighbor's catalytic converter getting stolen! How fun! People suck! And you're right, Garrett, it is as if they just stole your entire car because you cannot drive without one!   on a lighter note, it is always a joy to see a new Garrett video; the alley-oop to the sponsorship was incredible  update: dear god, i hope Garrett actually brought more food/gear/clothing than that  2nd update: oh, he did not. I think this *could've* been a good idea had he brought proper gear and sustenance, but without those things, existing outdoors is unpleasant  3rd update: my comfort movie(s) also include all the harry potters (I choose based on how much I want to cry)
"I'm a bad boy" I LOVE YOU SO MUCHHHHHHHHH LSKJGÇOAISJDG also (one of) my confort movie is White Chicks GETS ME HAPPY EVERYTIME
Dude, if you wanted to leave LA, you should have gone to Colorado and snuck around Shane and Ryland's house pretending to be a ghost.
Rip sweet boys :(
My comfort movie is Holes. I think I know every word by now?? One day, I will cosplay Kissin Kate Barlow
50 First Dates is a comfort movie for me as well. Also The Princess Bride. I've seen it countless times and it's still fantastic

Ok....anyone else confused about the butter knife in the cookies?? Andrew is a real wizard! 😂😧   Garrett brings me so much happiness 🤍

You are my inner voice.... And the voice my pets hear hehe💜
Same someone left my car on a jack and stole the catalytic converter  and the battery from under Mercedes
Steel Magnolias is a comfort movie that also makes me cry like a lil beech. Other comfort movies more have to do with memories surrounding them ie: people I watched them with. Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, Aladdin, the Labyrinth - just to name a few. ;) Glad you didn't die alone in the woods.
THE OLD ANIMATED DISNEY ROBIN HOOD WILL FOREVER BE ONE OF MY TOP COMFORT MOVIES!! Along with small soldiers for some reason?? The movie just bangs really, and that is my only explanation for loving it oh and the wannabe scene! Iconic!
My comfort movies would definetly be The Labyrinth because duh David Bowie. And Coraline and The Crow. And the second movie in the Dark Knight series. I have a lot. I love this video. Keep up the good work Garrett I wish i could meet you in person cuz man we would be the best of friends ❤
My biggest comfort movies are Cinderella (2015), mamma mia, Penelope, stardust, and princess and the frog. Cinderella is the one I turn to most but all of these are ones I go to when I need a little bit of dopamine.
I laughed out loud when reading the title
Yay I missed you.
Anything Tim Burton, I love you🖤🖤🖤
Kind of embarrassing, but Under the Tuscan sun, p.s. I love you and if I need all the comfort the entire Pirates of the Caribbean set in one sitting.
I relate to this man on a spiritual level, I swear💀😂

recently discovered that my comfort movie is employee of the month...
my comfort movies are kill bill, school of rock, and holes
I have been getting the strong urge myself. Like literally being energetically pulled to flee the monotonous cog in the machine we’re all stuck in.  Gonna build a hobbit hut on the side of a mountain. You’re not alone.
Omfg I cried laughing almost the entire time. 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭 Omfg my favorite video in a while! Also, where's Andrew?! Omg. This was SO FUCKING GOOD. I'm still crying from laughter.  I love yo 😻😻😻😻💜🌙🌔

Hi Garrett <3 to answer your question, my comfort movie would either be the given anime movie or a silent voice. Anyway, just wanted to say ily and you always make my day <333
I appreciate you too, Garrett <3
You know how when something’s so funny you have to rewind it and watch it again and then pause to give yourself time to laugh and enjoy the hilarity? I did that a LOT in this video. So much so that it took me over an hour to watch this😆🙃 Kudos on an excellent video Garrett! And to answer your question, my favorite comfort movies are The Big Year, and anything by Nancy Meyers or John Hughes. I’ve often thought about having a marathon of their movies but I don’t think my little heart could take it💜 Lots of love to you and have a happy and magical Halloween!🎃
My comfort movie is Super Bad, mainly cuz I love Bill Hader
Seriously Mary Poppins Returns is impossible to watch and not feel better.

50 First Dates is also one of my favorite comfort movies!! Nobody else seems to like it that much but I also think its very sweet

(2008).  For me any order is great, but always finish with Mamma Mia!
okay okay hear me out for my comfort movies: Captain America: Civil War, Moana, and Coraline . you’re welcome !!
Is it weird to say Zoolander, Rat Race, and White Chicks as my comfort movies? lol i’ve seen them so many times because they were our family movies growing up.

are lobsters immortal?  Contrary to popular belief, lobsters are not immortal. ... Eventually, the lobster will die from exhaustion during a moult. Older lobsters are also known to stop moulting, which means that the shell will eventually become damaged, infected, or fall apart and they die.

can i get sloppy toppy from you
if cops got to you you'd just have to show them everything you're recorded on your camera and they'll be like "oh, ok, this is just a crazy man but seems harmless"
I’m so sorry but my attention span is wayyy too short to sit and watch you talk in the same place for five minutes straight
How’s the mental breakdown going Garrett
If I could only watch one movie for the rest of my life, it would be Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart
mine is oceans 8 and happiest season
My comfort movie is Matilda !!!!!
*inhales* 🙏... GARRETT 1. Love the video, big mood 2.      a. Temperature can drop a surprising amount at night.      b. Maaybe don’t go in an area that may or may not be hunting ground?       c. Also... did you even bring a lighter?  3. My comfort movie might be Alien. Which actually sets off my anxiety so not sure it’s the best choice?
my comfort movie is soul :)

Are you okay
Come on VOCALS!!!!! Garrett, give us more! Can you cover a song, any song! Please!

I live in the woods and it is way better than LA.

COMFORT MOVIE IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE NEVERENDING STORY
Garrett you are a personified manic episode in the best way possible
My comfort movie is definitely Luca now, I also love the karate kid movies anddddd back to the future is my favorite movie ever and I would definitely consider it a comfort movie, but the problem is if I watch one I have to watch all three.
the beard is it for me
Yes! Missed you
awhh I love Garrett
not the SB fandom thinking you grew out your hair to match captain america for halloween when in reality the haircut place is closed 😭
I wish I had that pure love that Garret has for insects, I do love animals more than anything ever but I can’t do insects, pretty much any insect terrifies me. I have pretty bad arachnophobia so anytime I see a spider or spider like creature I freak and can’t be near there. It’s the worst when it’s in my car, because I’ll sit outside my car for 20 mins until it’s gone or I am forced to kill it cause obviously it’s always when I’m on a time crunch lol.
My comfort movie has to be Rocky IV. it’s a tie between that and Princess and the Frog, for obvious reasons
"BUTTERKNIFE, BITCH!" HHAHAH IM DED
My comfort movie is Endless Summer 2. Been watching it since my early 20's
you should come out with the album!!!!!
My comfort movie is the Fifth Element… Chris Tucker and John Paul Gaultier deserved Oscar’s for their contribution to that masterpiece

My comfort movie is Bolt, from Disney
My comfort movie has been shrek.. it reminds me of when my children were little. Garrett - you never fail to make me laugh 😃
You just create so much Marauders vibes, idk how to explain it
My comfort film would have to be coraline <3
Garrett,  I'm an Indian and I specifically looked for payday after coming to the US because you said you liked it (in a video with Morgan and ryland)🤣
I don’t know what to say but I’m going to try to make the next step closer to the future of our new life as a family of friends to celebrate our lives together with a great friend of the year
It’s not technically a movie but lately my comfort content has been Bo Burnham’s Inside for sure

bruce almighty is my comfort movie cause it was the only dvd we had growing up so I would just watch it over and over ^^" also the first potter movie of course
The fact that Garret didn’t know the North of California is just like…brown for a long time is so funny to me as a NorCal resident. Go to Yosemite next time Garret, you’d love it there.
My comfort movies are Man in the Iron Mask and The Princess Bride
ACE VENTURE MOVIES & THE FIRST SPONGE BOB MOVIEEE
Garrett's laughter fuels me
I absolutely need to know what Moulin Rouge song you were singing and if it was from the movie or the Broadway musical!!!!
My comfort movie is Pride and Prejudice. I can have it on in the background and it makes me feel like I’m not alone.
Sounds like mercury retrograde has hit you hard this year
I have an adult teddy shark 🦈
Garrett is just shaggy from scooby-doo
My comfort movie is whip it or tank girl

Theres like 700 movies telling you why bot to do this but it takes balls lmao
Love you too, Garrett!! <3 Thank you for sharing.
Dude my comfort movie is the 1968 Night of the living dead and has been since I was about 6yrs old (I’m 38 now) I don’t know why but if I put it on I can get super comfortable and relaxed.
you know it’s gonna be a bones day when garrett posts
Are you on crack
My comfort movie is either IT (2017) or Ferris Buellers Day Off
You look like the character Aaron from the movie Creep
It's really interesting to see from another perspective from one of those "top 3 TRUE scary stories about DISTURBING and suspicious neighbors"
did GARRETT JUST FIND A FUCKING HUMAN SKELETON REMAINS !!!!!! GURL RUN !!!
Happy feet 2
if the freezer half needs defrosting it may 'overheat' the fridge. I'm not an expert, but this literally happened to me. I bought a new fridge, defrosted the freezer and the fridge half started working again.... I now have two fridges :/
Garrett, I love you so much. You're definitely my spirit animal ❤
You are so dang cute. I'm pulled towards your energy 🙂 pls do more exploring haunted places videos!
One of my biggest comfort movies is Mr Magoriums Wonder Emporium.
try unplugging and defrosting your fridge/freezer! my fridge did the same thing where the freezer worked but not the fridge and defrosting it worked!
Modern day Fred movie
Best comfort movie = monsters inc 🥺
i like the beard actually- it cute :)  Also my comfort movies are Rise of the Guardians (p much a lot of animated movies in general). But weirdly it's also night at the museum. The entire trilogy probably. And the end always makes me cry because of Robin Williams and what he says at the end.
omnist is actually closer to explaining a belief in all religions
My comfort movie is Jurassic Park 🦖
He should have came back to Washington to run away in the woods 😂 so much dense forest
you know..? if you can laugh at yourself, then everybody's laughing WITH you instead of at you inyurface.
Ive realized looking around my room, that theres alot of skeletons just vibing. I guess it came from Garrett LMFAO
Lmao Garrett cracks me up but I feel like running away too all the time
I'm thinkin how the hell did this show up on my feed. Wondering if I dislike it will it not come back. I'm going to be #231.
I have soooo many comfort movies. Clueless, The Craft, Jawbreaker, HP, ANY Studio Ghibli! List is endless 😂
Occasionally I doubt Garrett's sanity
If you put your hair in a low ponytail you'll look like a viking. 🦹🤺
i also have a lot of comfort movies but Spice World never fails me
Yay! Thanks Garrett! So excited to watch!
My comfort movie is the trolls movie :)
My comfort movie is the BEE MOVIE 🐝 don’t ask
I thought this was gonna be peaceful I thought it was gonna be zen as hell 💀😂
Hey Garrett, if you want to get REALLY adventurous, come up to Washington and stay with us. We have a huge house, Pets, autistic 5 year old, 14 year old artist (drawing), a 24 year old son who looks a bit like you and I have said for years, you two would probably be each other's soul mate. There is always something crazy going on and we know of several haunted areas. And..and..we have tons of crafts here in our house. Anything you want to make, we probably have it. Bring Andrew! I'm sure we could create some epic content. I use to be a photographer and now I just make stuff...literally a bit of everything. Our family is a bit gothic, a bit country and a lot of just weird. 😂 Just a thought!
My comfort movie is THe Last Unicorn its just the best shit ever it pls watch it if you havent and if you have you know what im talking about
Garrett looks so….frazzled
Zeke?!
am I the only one who listens to the song that Garrett made in 24 hrs?
garrett your videos are always the best!!! <3
It's your fan that moves the cool air from the freezer. It's an easy fix you can do yourself. That's the clunking noise too.
My comfort movie is What's Eating Gilbert Grape 😌
My comfort movie is Hocus Pocus. I could be ready to jump off a bridge..put that on, and I'm back.
All I can say is thank you. It sounds so silly, but I have been dealing with so much lately and it's been taking a toll on my mental health, but watching your videos reminds me so much that no matter what is going on in the world, it's important to laugh at yourself and have fun. I've been a fan for years, and you remind me of so much of myself because I have so much love for bugs and halloween and figures and pretty much everything. I name every inanimate object I see and bug friends are the best of friends. Thank you for uploading during a dark time in my life, because it is reminding me of how much I love myself, I hope that doesn't sound weird or anything. I have always been afraid to express myself and watching your videos always brightens my day and reminds me that it is okay to just be myself and have fun. So thank you for being you, and most importantly thank you for leaving those woods and getting taco bell because I would have done the exact same thing. Also my comfort movies are Grown Ups, Kung Fu Panda, and School of Rock <3
I work at a automotive shop… Why is this the 5th stolen cat I’ve heard of this week in LA county 😅🤣
YOU LOOK AMAZING GARRETT
Garrett, the scariest thing in those woods are you.  Digging a hole in the middle of the woods with two skeletons leaning up a tree, a sword and a whip casually laying on the ground and a posessed demon-baby peeking up behind a log 😳
Three words though  Sweet Boys Podcast  🥺
Yay I missed you!!
Build a small cabin on a trailer

Seek after.. (there are those that pray fast after hearing about what you said) -------Deleted only cause you SCARDE                  WWJD
I have so many comforst movies, but some of the first that come to mind are Legally Blonde, Devil Wears Prada, cheesy rom-coms(especially bad netflix Christmas films)(a particular favorite being Falling Inn Love)
There was a Hilton commercial that came on right as night fell and you panned up to the moon. Almost to be like “see this? Don’t do this. Come stay at a hotel.” 🤣
Garrett, I love you and your videos! My comfort movie, it's between the Twilight saga and "By the Sea" (by Angelina Jolie, with Angelina and Brad). The latter is not really comforting at all in its story and theme but for some reason I love the mood and cinematography and how classy and french and Vogue it feels, I want to live in it.
Omg my comfort movies are New Moon, Tangled,  anything with Dwayne Johnson in it (San Andreas is my top)!
not to be THAT person but mercury is in retrograde

my comfort movies include disney’s hercules, coraline, bridget jones’ diary, and the 1996 movie starring katherine heigl and an actress that i always thought was hayden penettiere (but actually isn’t) “wish upon a star”
My comfort movie definitely The Outsiders. Also I love u Garrett! Thanks for coming back when I needed you the most❤️😊✨
my comfort movies consist of a lot of halloween/spooky movies! like beetlejuice or the addam's family (the 1990's ones specifically) any nostalgic 90's-2000's children films :)
Comfort Movie: Ernest Goes to Camp and Monster Squad
Garrett & October just makes sense. Also my comfort movie is Saving Mr Banks it’s just really good & sad :)
I lived in the Appalachian mnts for my childhood and got thrown into metropolitan hell in florida in my teens...Now in my 20’s I cant wait to finish college and go crawl back into the woods where I belong haha! Its not for everyone. Noises can get spooky and if there were to be a monster, it’d probably be in the woods lol.
I farted
My comfort movies are Harry Potter all of them always, Bring It On (the first one), or the Conjuring (the first one). This was a great video! Proud and Love you muchly!
I seen Over the Hedge in theaters and I cried. My mom never lets me live it down, I'm 27 right now and the movie came out when I was in 6th grade.
ok OK OK ok I love the topic of comfort movies / movies period!  Mine is weird in that it's intense but somehow relaxes me, it's Black Swan.  I can watch it like on a loop back to back.  Also The Place Beyond the Pines.  also can't get enough of old movies like 30's-80's era
my comfort movie is the entire tinker bell franchise. i don’t know if that counts but oh well.
Shoes
My comfort movie is bridesmaids but if two are allowed then, also- guardians of the galaxy vol. 1!
My comfort movie is Harry Potter and the Sorcerers stone, The rugrats Movie, and the Addams family because I used to watch all those at least three times a month when I was little lmao
Garret, I have had the STRANGEST day of my life, and coming home to a video from you is the most kind gift I've could ever receive thank you for each and every one of these.
my comfort movie is the first jurassic park!!<3
If you go with proper equipment I think you can make it a whole night!
my comfort movie is every harry potter movie, coraline, and the nightmare before christmas
My comfort movie is Love Actually because I'm a bitch but I have my feelings
The fact that you were going through this when I was probs watching bobs burgers is hilarious
I missed you and your style so muchhhh <3
I have MANY comfort movies but probably the one that I will literally always be in the mood to watch is Chef, starring Jon Favreau. It’s so happy and the soundtrack SLAPS and I feel so good after watching it every time
my favorite comfort movie is definitely labyrinth from jim henson !!
Glad you didn't get eaten by a bear or arrested Garrett! This time of life sucks right now, but keep pushin. we're here for you and tbh i bet we all would've joined you in the woods lmaoo. My comfort movie is eternal sunshine of the spotless mind, a legendary film😰stay cool man we love youu💛
How random--my fridge part died too last week... but the freezer is now the fridge part... meaning: I have no ice and I'm very upset about it and my landlord is a c*nt.
GARRETT DID U GET A NEW PHONE?! I HAVE ANXIETY FOR YOU LMAOO
“If I see a bear that’s not chill” 😂😂
My comfort movie is Totoro <3
My comfort movies are Coraline and My Best Friends Wedding. When she's smoking in the hall, and the bell boy sits with her and has a drag and tells her "this too shall pass", soothes my soul every time
this was pure chaos omg
Comfort movies is a great question. Mine is 100% Batman & Robin. It's definitely a nostalgia thing because it's objectively terrible but after 28 years it's still the ONLY Batman film I have ever seen. That means George Clooney is the only Batman I have ever known. In my reality, George Clooney IS Batman. Let that sink in
My comfort movies is hands down charlies angels and tank girl
ratatouille is my comfort movie
This is why Garrett was always supreme. Shane tries wayyyyyy to hard to be relatable and "quirky" whereas with Garrett it feels like this is him and if you don't want to stick around that's okay, have a nice day! (And he genuinely means it)
"I'll just die and see what happens" is how I'm going to explain my being agnostic to everyone from now on
This video was like a comfort film <3 It was good relief from schoolwork. Good comfort SHOW is Parks&Rec or The Office.
True romance!
Your explanation of Agnosticism is very incorrect. To be agnostic mean you don’t believe humans have the answers to questions about what created life and the universe and that it is completely unknown. All those theories such as in Christianity or Islam are just theories and not factual at all. Agnostics don’t believe in everything
Could you imagine if this was found footage and the guy who finds it just watching this insane hyperactive man talking to the camera😂
Twilight is my ultimate comfort movie. The pacific northwest aesthetic of the film is everything to me. It's like the equivalent of that feeling when it's raining outside and you curl up with a good book. Plus it has a great soundtrack
Comfort movie: toy story. Comfort show: gilmore girls
28:08 Garret looks like Zeke Jaeger from attack on titan with that look
Wish drew was there
The Lion King and Tombstone are my comfort movies.
Tell me you’re joining the search for Brian Laundrie without telling me you’re joining the search for Brian Laundrie.  Garrett: I LIVE IN THE WOODS NOW 🙃
MY FREEZER STOPPED WORKING BUT THE FRIDGE HALF OF IT STILL WORKS…WHAAA
American Dad is my comfort show! I can watch it all through over and over again 😅
Washington!
Absolutely loved seeing an update from you! And just loved it as I always do! Where was sarcastic lady though?!? Xxx
My top comfort movies are LOTR, Pride and Prejudice, Laws of Attraction, and Mamma Mia ofc
Garrett you were basically asking for a bear to eat you with that cookie trail lol
I was truly scared for you, it probably said do not enter because it was near a gun range.
He reminds me of Shaggy from Scooby Doo
My comfort movie is Baby Geniuses 😍
Omg!!! You are sooo brave! (And a little bit stupid but mostly brave) I would shit my pants and die alone in the woods  in the darkness! That was fk spooky!!! But at the end you are so right about the living life part and running from problems away…. I’m such a  mess, too. (I was living without a fridge longer than a year and since my old car died I can’t buy new one.) I’m 30 and still didn’t figure out how to live life. I hope your friend spider is now in heaven with all beloved insects and the rest of dead  creatures. R.I.P little spider-friend. And my comfort movies are Pride and prejudice 😂 and all HP of course.  I hope that you are fine now! Lots of love from Austria!! ❤️ xoxo
"I have decided to run away from everything" Same

on the adam sandler note, my comfort movie is grown ups... nothing says cosy like a lake house w the homies
i would say my comfort movie is this movie that i feel like not a ton of people have heard of. it’s called earth to echo and something about it always comforts me.. my comfort show is gravity falls though and it is the best show ever
You're welcome Garrett....and thank YOU!
Hope u didn't  get bit by a ticket lyme  disease  is no joke put me in a wheelchair
Hi Garrett, woods are scary
I've got 2 comfort movies: the 2005 Pride and Prejudice and Howl's Moving Castle. They got me through  going to college during a pandemic.
Anyone else paused the video at a certain time and it made you feel really special?
RIP spider friend. You will be missed. I’m actually very sad about his passing. I love the daddy long legs at my house. They never bother me so I let them hang out.
nice search history LOL, and id say that my comfort movie is probably fantastic mr. fox
My comfort movie is Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. It NEVER fails to make me laugh.

Parent Trap, Accepted, The House Bunny, Hot Tub Time Machine, 13 Going On 30, Easy A, A Cinderella Story, Aquamarine, Tangled, Big Hero 6, Rise Of The Guardians, and Megamind are some that comfort movies I love. :) And Scott Pilgrim VS. The World, can’t believe I forgot it!
20:22 💀
my comfort movie is definitely Whisper of the Heart. it's a nice reminder that not everyone has their life planned out and that's okay. as long as you're trying and enjoying doing so everything will be okay. another one would be Anastasia. the music and animation is just so beautiful. the color scheme just makes me feel happy.
this is really random but my comfort movie is how to train your dragon jshdjc idk i just loved this movie since i was 9 and i always rewatched it to cheer up oh and the first matrix movie brings so many good memories i cant describe
what
My current comfort movie is the 2005 Pride and Prejudice. The soundtrack is just so nice and soft. And it’s romantic and there’s Kiera Knightly.
sorry Garrett when it rains it pours. But I always appreciate an upload from you my dude.
Labyrinth and Doctor Strange are my comfort movies lol

Mercury retrograde has really effed the best of us, I also had the strangest urge to leave and “runaway” somewhere secluded. Just to breath! Thank you for making this video because I would have most definitely left  to get Taco Bell as well. Sometimes running away seems like a good idea but it can be very dangerous and scary  and I’m glad nothing too crazy happened, Garrett! My fav comfort movie is the first original Poltergeist.
GARRETT U LOOK SO HOT
Mercury retrograde hit Garrett hard!
27minutes onwards = pop off Bo Burnham

Garreeeett I was so happy to see you posted thank you for blessing me today. As for comfort movies it’s kind of embarrassing but the hobbit trilogy- only if I’m watching it with my sister though. We would have Hobbit movie marathons once in a while (more often than any two people should tbh) but she just moved away for college so we won’t be doing that again for a while. Also Luca is a new one that’s defo become one of my comfort movies, I’ve been watching that a lot

You can use a car without the catalytic converter, a lot of people take em off (which is toootallly legal...) to make the car loud when you floor it, all it does is make better emissions. I mean it'll definitely degrade your engine after a while but you could drive it, just dont go by cops lol
I feel like every time Garret gets stressed he will say that he just needs some grapes
"and I'm taking you with me"  🥺 Thank you Gar-bear ❤️❤️❤️
Okay, but for real though, Garrett looks very aesthetically attractive to me. He's like a giant teddy bear and looks really cuddly.
Some of my comfort movies are Harry Potter, Arsenic and Old Lace, Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, and Jaws. 🙂
I literally jumped when the tree fell on you 😂
my comfort movie is Howls Moving Castle or Scott Pilgrim VS the World Howls Moving Castle when I feel the need for something wholesome Scott Pilgrim for when I need a good laugh
my comfort movie is Pride & Prejudice
Garrett on his Ralph Waldo Emerson arc 🤩
My comfort movies is- without a doubt -Klaus. It's on Netflix :)
My comfort movie is Trolls
One of my comfort movies would be Spirited Away!  Also great video, hope you’re doing great!
Mamma Mia, Skyfall, and Begin Again are my chosen means of ~comfort~
Garrett’s sponsors are the only ones I actually stop and watch instead of just skipping them. Does he makes them actually interesting? Or do I just not want to skip it because he never uploads and I want to watch this as long as possible? We’ll never know
Did no one else see that my mans googled "are lobsters immortal" lmao
The accidental whippit that Garrett took when trying to get some whipped cream 😂
so this is what garrett does when he isn’t posting   i missed u😭
Alexa play Lost In The Woods from Frozen II
Garrett, we all know you just brought the can to do whippets in the woods 😂

My comfort movie is Anastasia, or Corpse Bride, or Thor Ragnarok, or the Winnie the Pooh christmas special 🥺
My comfort movie is Rocky Horror Picture Show
Does anyone know what Garrett does for work? I’m always curious….lol
Comfort movies. Hmm. Forrest Gump, Titanic and Back to the Future.
Every new garret video is him moving houses
Titanic or grease
I grew up watching Clue anytime it rained.
And it was a bones day too :D
You're trending in the UK :)
Garrett- again I will keep commenting this... please do more music you are so talented x
Pride and Prejudice (2005) is my comfort movie, the lighting, the costumes, the music, everything about it is so nice and gentle
Definitely any Marvel movie but the princess bride is the best ❤️
I'm mentally ill too.
Is nobody going to talk about the bones? 😭😭😭
I know this is a day late but Garrett I had a dream and you were like a NPC but I woke up and thought to myself "I wonder how Garrett is" and then you uploaded so I'm very happy
Next time Garrett.... bring an adult
two words: mercury retrograde
I honestly love watching Garrett he’s like a grown child 😂
My comfort movie is the lord of the rings extended editions WITH the special features. I must have watched those 12 discs like 100 times at least.
comfort movie is for sure twilight-the blue filter really calms me lol
step brothers
Garrett! Please post more! Literally anything! 🥰
Are lobsters immortal 🤣🤣
Garret has always been the one that made collab videos fun 😌 and his personal videos are amazing as well
That tree fall legit scared me, perfectly executed.

my comfort movie is 10 things i hate about you
*watches all the ads to help garrett get a working fridge*
Lilo and stitch is my comfort movie:)
coraline is my comfort movie. sometimes i listen to the soundtrack to lower anxiety
Go visit shane at Colorado PLSS
my comfort movies are Treasure Planet and Atlantis The Lost Empire! I love the combo of 2D characters with 3D background elements and objects, especially when the 3D isn't done very well lol. Treasure Planet feels like you're watching a dnd campaign someone made for themself and never got to share with an actual party. Atlantis feels like you're a conspirator making an epic story of how people found Atlantis and it feels somewhat like a cautionary tale. These movies are just so comforting and the main characters are so relatable and they always make me feel safe.
NOTTING HILL!
14:55 ….. dare I say…… a Bear crow????
So, basically Garett has been experiencing Mercury Retrograde...
My boy! My precious boy is back
Garrett it's called Mercury Retrograde, she came in strong this year
this. this makes sense.
he's really pulling the 2am sell my stuff and move to the forest meme, huh? I respect that
Fun fact: I give a thumbs up before I even watch Garrett’s videos, because I know I’m going to love it always 💕
the phantom of the opera, dark shadows and the conjuring
Rise of the Guardians is definitely my comfort movie. It’s such a pretty movie, and the music is so good, and it’s just all good.
Adults can have teddy bears too! <3 Enjoy your stuffed friend.
I have a few comfort movies. I watch ‘Meet Me in St. Louis’, all the twilights and ‘IT Chapter 2’
i <3 you garrett. you make my days brighter!
Smokey and the bandit I watched it so much as a child and still do it makes me smile every time I watch it I even have a pop funko of bandit in my room
You know what’s crazy is that Age of Ultron is my comfort movie. Does that make me a psychopath
I like it before I even watch it because I just know.
harry potter 1 is my forever comfort movie but the past couple years the movie moxie has been my go-to. it’s just a sweet movie and i love anything having to do with teen girls coming into their own and dunking on the patriarchy a bit.
my comfort movie is School of Rock, or Fantasia lol
Lowkey stressed cuz of thinking about your safety in this vid lol. Btw damnnnn he’s fine 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Ok but we need to know what song from Moulin Rouge you were singing. That’s very important Garrett 👀
really glad you didn’t get eaten or murdered, bud 💕 my comfort movies include: chef, tangled, the mummy, stranger than fiction, my cousin vinny, and last holiday. my poor sibling can attest to that last one, as i watched it every night for weeks before bed when we were sharing a room and they can probably quote the whole thing from memory now, which i would feel really bad about, but it’s an excellent movie, so instead i just feel a little bad about it.
Garrett is an angel ❤️🧸
My comfort movie is a Bollywood movie actually called Kabhi Khusi Kabhie Gham bc it’s just amazing and always makes me laugh. And as someone who lives near many forests, I wouldn’t dream of living in them they’re terrifying😂
This is the chaotic content that I’ve been missing lately- thank you Garrett!!
I too had my Cadillac converter from my Prius stolen this year, I understand you Garrett
My comfort movie is The Hobbit…or Harry Potter 1… or Scream bc I love Stu… or The Simpsons Movie. I really don’t know.
Love the hair and beard!
My comfort movie is probably Miss Congeniality. Or any Amanda Bynes/Hilary Duff movie of the early aughts.
My comfort movie would probably be The Hateful 8 😌, I know it's a horrible movie but everyone in it is amazing. Plus the 1800s were cool 😆
Yay he posted ☺️
My comfort movie is Cinderella 2015 and my comfort show is the golden girls
My comfort movie is absolutely lego batman movie and I don’t care who knows
Your car can work and run 100% fine without a catlilitic converter by the way. If you take it into a exaust shop and tell them your cat got stolen and you don't want it replaced but you want them to qeld a pipe in its place then boom you have a perfectly fine car that sounds alot cooler then it did before
My comfort movie is Stardust, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle & Kiki's Delivery Service
I have so many comfort movies but the first three I thought of were Mamma Mia, Sweeney Todd, and to all the boys I've loved before...... one of these things is not like the others.
What's your favourite Moulin Rouge song?
My comfort movie is Penelope (2006) -- It's a modern fairytale with Christina Ricci and Catherine O'Hara and I feel like nobody ever talks about this movie (maybe people don't like it idk) but it literally always makes me feel better.   Also, I fully thought you were gonna run into a body out there in the woods. Be safe Garrett!
Homeboy just googled google.
garrett i love you and this video so much but i’m convinced that this is a cry for help
My comfort movies are Princess and the Pauper (the barbie one) or Spirit (the horse movie from Dreamworks). Princess and the pauper really became my comfort movie for when I get sick, because I first watched it while at the hospital when I was like, 8. It always finds a way to make me feel just a bit better when I don't feel good physically.
Ted kazanki 2 electric boogaloo
21:30 - Was that a fox in the right upper corner? :D
My comfort movie is Ferris Bueller's Day Off! And Gnomeo and Juliet, but I only watch that one at 3am.

My comfort movie is 13 Going On 30 <3 makes my heart very happy every time!
My comfort movie is the Goofy Movie. At the end of semesters, graduations, the end of night shift (when I was still a night shift nurse) watching Goofy Movie enabled me to breathe that sigh of relief.  Also, your videos comforted my anxiety before shifts when I was a new nurse. Thank you for being there 🙏🏼

1.  Your phone died after falling in the sink?  I've dropped my phone many times but it still works (knock on plastic). 2..  Oooo,  I love Bit o Honey!  I'm gonna have to look for some now that it's planted in my head! 🥰 3.  Shame on those CC thieves! 4. Have you heard there's a demented alleged murderer hiding out in the woods?  (Just sayin)  Be careful!! So glad you survived your ordeal!! As for comfort movies - can't think of one.  However, watching cartoons usually lifts my spirits. 🐻😃
The tree falling edit was a jump scare for me 😂 should've know it was coming

Garrett I love you.  Dear all this crazy shit is happening because 5 different planets are in Retrograde right now.

Okay this might be a stretch, but I don’t know if you’ve noticed that tea lady has disappeared. I feel like this represents Garrett’s growth and he’s started putting himself down less which he was partially doing in his videos through tea lady. And that makes me so happy.

Nick and Norahs infinite playlist  💜
My comfort movie is the selena gomez or lucy hale version cinderella lol
This reminds me of myself when I got the idea to "play pirate" and convinced my friend to take the last boat of the day to the only island near here to spend the night on the beach. All while dressed up as pirates. I had imaged a campfire and drinking and singing sea shanty's and dancing.... but it started to rain (ofc I hadn't checked the weather) so we couldn't get a fire going... no shelter... we just sat soaking wet at the beach downing a bottle of rum... being swarmed by weird sand/seaweed shrimps that like jumped all over us?... until I started feeling *really* sick and throwing up, and we had to call an ambulance bc I'm diabetic and it's like, not a good thing? when that happens? I was fine, just too drunk.   It was amazing.
I love this man
Mine is shrek and scream!!
Get your instant serotonin here!!!!!
my comfort movie is just go with it or shrek lmfao
My comfort movie rn is prolly Venom, I have no clue why but I can quite literally quote it by now
This reminds me of the fan animated music video for inchman by Jack Stauber
“Garret Watts: Outside”
I look at Garrett and have hope for myself, because if he can survive in the world I can too.

my comfort film is popstar: never stop never stopping!!

Pay it forward  and Milo and Otis best comfort movies.
Imagine seeing a white van with skeletons in it and a creepy doll, then you see a weird man get out of the van and when you ask him why he has skeletons in his car he says “oh to keep me company.”

I’m 36 years old and my comfort movie is Disney’s cartoon Beauty and The Beast and Braveheart. 🤷‍♀️

I'm sure you've heard of it but Fantastic Mr. Fox will always hold a dear place in my heart!
MY COMFORT MOVIE IS 51ST DATES TO
Yay!!!! You made my day. And I like the look, beard and longer hair!! Have a wonderful day!!
My comfort movie used to be any of the Harry Potter and Avengers franchise but right now it’s Whisper of the Heart and Spirited Away.
I missed you! Glad you're back. 😊
my comfort movie is the damn hannah montana movie. but i cant lie it touches a part of my heart thats really special. it just makes me comfy and nostalgic and feel safe. every time i watch it it's almost like a hug from childhood and a pat on the back for how im doing yknow? also the songs in it still go hard
bear-crow
There will be no lol 😝
my comfort movies are fantastic mr fox and every single harry potter movie :)
Your lack of understanding what footwear to wear in the woods immediately made me realize how bad of an idea this was.
Whenever someone asks me about Garrett's videos I can only use the words "chaotic good" to explain his content
Comfort movies include cloudy with a chance of meatballs and Howells moving castle. Garrett you sooth the heart and brighten the soul
I would LOVE to see you actually plan and execute a camping trip for real though
Watch Garrett find Brian Laundrie and be besties.
I always love when you finally post again and I hope you're doing okay. This was a fun video. As silly as it is, my comfort movie is The Emperor's New Groove.
I can't believe someone went through all that effort to steal a part of your car 😱
Oh no... you reminded me of my horrid habit of getting people gifts and never sending them.... oooooppps.   I either straight up forget or shipping is too complicated or expensive.
my comfort movies are Tangled and 13 Going on 30 :)
saw 2004 ultimate comfort
Sleeping in Seattle is one of my comfort movies. :)
zeke is that u?
Garrett Frozen Grapes are actually bomb 😌 My mom would always have frozen grapes packed for when we went to the pool 💕
Garrett posted when I needed a good feeling of "everything is okay now let's just become a big pile of blankets and cry and watch good feeling vids" so thank you Garrett ur may upload slow but sometimes you upload at a good time :) thank you.
WHY DO YOU MOVE SO MUCH LMAO, BUT I DOESNT MATTER CUASE I REALLY LOVE IT
Agnostic individuals are a charcuterie board of religions.💖🧀🥖🥕🍓🍤🧁🍫  Ps. I have a skeleton dog. A pet for the three skeletons.
Garrett you’re so attractive
Garret it the kind of person to set a freezer on fire
Comfort movies : how to train your dragon & the devil wears prada
Garrett kinda looks a bit like zeke jeagar
A great comfort movie of mine is Fantastic Mr. Fox. Loved the video as always!
Does Garrett know that he makes videos that are perfectly catered to people with ADHD? these videos are so easy to watch!!!!
The part about hoping he doesn’t die bc of the Matrix movie coming out… lol me.
My comfort movies are sausage party and Shrek.
You are my comfort movie whenever you post
I love so many movies I can’t decide on just one comfort movie lol
You remind me so much of my brother that I feel like I know you personally. Lol.   My comfort movie is finding Nemo. ❤️❤️❤️
My comfort movie is The Buddy Holly story. The Gary Bussey one. Like there's another one out there or something. 🤪 For some reasons which are completely unknown I used to watch this movie almost everyday as a kid. I loved the music. I'm 40 and yes I was a strange child. 🤘😎
you don’t look insane but you look like Zeke from snk so yeah that checks out
my comfort movie was coraline for a WHILE and i still love it but now i’d say it’s either howls moving castle or fantastic mr fox :)
Surprised that he didn't bump into that mediocre survivalist Laundrie kid. Thank God! Btw, my comfort movies:  The Holiday The Proposal That Thing You Do!
My comfort movie is Swiss Army Man (starring Daniel Radcliffe as a farting corpse), it changed my life and also kind of reminds me of you. When you watch it you might think that’s an insult but trust me it’s the probably the highest praise I can give someone that I don’t know personally.
Garret I thought about your hair before I even clicked on the video
Garrett has a weird way of making me feel so safe and chaotic at the same time honestly love it💖
okay but which moulin rouge song
My comfort movie has definitely got to be Drop Dead Fred!!! I laugh every single time and it always leaves me feeling happier 😊
Garret AND Shane we hit the jackpot guys
Current comfort movie is The Little Prince : ) I grew up with the book, have a tattoo of the prince, and the movie is literally on my phone! It's an adult philosophy book, about adulthood, written in the guise of a child's book. It's beautiful and so comforting when I feel like I'm not being a "good enough" adult <3
My comfort movie is The Goonies
My comfort movies are the mummy movies and stoneherst asylums  Thanks for the spooky video Garrett!
The tree falling part scared me. Made me jump in the sofa 😂😂😂
My comfort movie is The Labyrinth with David Bowie 💛💛
Garret your amazing 🤣🤣 Love the spontaneity! I think the no trespassing sign may have been because that area was a hunting area? Totally not sure but given what you heard 😅
THE AMOUNT OF JOY WHEN I GOT THIS NOTIFICATION 😮‍💨😮‍💨
THE LONGER HAIR REALLY SUITS U GARRETT
garrett i love watching your videos. you make my days better.
my comfort movie is ratatouille, there is nothing more therapeutic then watching a rat cook.
Love  when Garrett uploads!! My comfort movie is Labyrinth or Pitch Black lol which is so not a comfort movie but I watch it all the time.
my comfort movie is ratatouille, there is nothing more therapeutic then watching a rat cook.
Garrett: I was watching Cowboy Bebop. Me: *likes video*
That’s probably the best explanation of Agnostic I’ve ever heard 💗
My comfort movies are Matilda, The Breakfast Club and Joker, also- thank you for reminding me that Nature isn’t my thing and that I shouldn’t run away into the woods by myself
My comfort movies are Mrs Doubtfire and Coraline :)
Love your jam sesh in the jeep xoxo 😘
Lord of the rings
"Not me eating room temperature grapes, researching how to escape Los Angeles" - Garrett Watts 10/15/21
I'm so happy, my day is made. 🥺❤️
Garret is just the most unproblematic youtuber ever he just does his own thing and it’s always hilarious
Stop!!!! I just tweeted the other day coco was my comfort movie!!!! Twinsies
My comfort movie is definitely Goonies! HEY YOU GUYS!!!
Yea you probably shouldn't be on private property in the woods because when you aren't allowed places in the woods it's for a reason one being people could be hunting in those woods and you could get shot. It's not cute and corky it's reckless and dangerous to do shat like this. Oh and leaving food around awesome that doesn't lure bears and animals to you 🙄
I don't have a comfort movie. But more of a comfort genre which is netflix cooking/baking competitions. Having a bad day: just watch hours of nailed it.  Some of the shows are absolutely garbage but i love it
giving me Micheal from The Office vibes xD
My comfort movie is absolutely Scott Pilgrim vs The World. I've seen it at least 47 times. And I know you didn't ask about a comfort series but I just gotta say...I've seen Naruto one too many times in my adult life....
Mercury retrograde mate
my comfort films are Stand by me, , American werewolf in London, Enter the dragon and The Thing
my comfort movies are Coraline and Anastasia
Pitch Perfect and Mean Girls.
Ok so comfort movie always has been Little Monsters from the 1980s featuring howie mandel & Fred and Ben savage !!
My comfort movie is literally “my babysitter’s a vampire” 😅 I’ve watched it far too many times. It just brings me back to where I was when I first watched it as a kid and it’s nice. I’ll just have it on in the background sometimes. I dunno, it’s just…. comforting. Yeah lol
I totally think the same way as far as the signs, lol. If I have a big decision to make and something bad happens I see that as a sign not to commit to whatever big thing I was deciding on, lol.
Does Garrett brush his teeth with the water running 😱
Garret it’s just the Mercury retrograde
So happy to see you uploading :) my comfort movie is probably Princess Mononoke but ugh 50 first dates is such a classic like you said
Wooo an upload!! Good for us
Legend has it Garrett videos only come around when you need them the most.... 🌠   PS Labyrinth is my comfort movie
My favorite comfort movie is definitely the Grinch 😍
Especially don't go even more north where I live in the Humboldt county area, cuz if you go on to someone's grow they will shoot you.
Garett should audition for survivor. That’s what I call content
I have so many comfort movies. The breakfast club will always be my favourite though!
My comfort movie is the live action The Cat in the Hat with Mike Myers. Weird, I know. But my siblings and I watched it on repeat as a kid so not only can I quote almost the entire thing, it makes me feel like we’re together when I watch it now that I live 3 hours away ❤️
Omg I have so many comfort movies and tv shows, ok movies are - Twilight, Baby Mama, Steel Magnolias, Zombieland 1and 2, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, Sex and The City, Thor Ragnarok, Deadpool 1 and 2, Romy and Michelle's Highschool Reunion,  John Tucker Must Die, A Simple Favor, Tv shows are - The Big Bang Theory, Reba, Friends, Sex and The City, 90210, The Golden Girls,  and Ancient Aliens 😍📺🍿
Parts in general are very hard to get ahold of, I work at Oreilly Auto Parts  and as a business, we had to buy a carrier, make our own shelving units (those are out at sea also) and go get our damn parts!!  I’m glad I work for a company that got ahead of the problem a little bit, but we need the employees to ship them across our country too…. It is a huge problem!!!
Garrett is this your folklore era? 😭
Comfort movies: moulin Rouge,  and all of the back to the futures.
BONE DAY VIBES
They literally have a harry potter potions shop in Longton, Stoke-On-Trent you would absolutely love it
My comfort movie is Luca!! I loooooove the characters. And Kiki's delivery service. Also Hilda even tho it's a series :)

I love this episode of Alone

aw i love 50 first dates! In high school for theater we reenacted that movie and i played Adam Sandler c: Also my comfort movies are: Legally Blond, Charlies Angles, Twilight (it's nostalgic okay!), and a TV show called Shadowhunters where there are angles, demon's, wizard's, warlocks, vampires, werewolf's, and teen drama truly the best of all worlds! (also my favorite comfort food is Domino's.. felt like i should mention that)
my comfort movies are whisper of the heart, only yesterday, columbus (2017), paranorman (you’d LOVE that one) and bolt LOL
my favorite comfort move? Jim Henson's 'Labyrinth'
Ok but I’m 100% feeling the beard and hair tho
What happened to the podcast
the tree that fell on Garrett actually scared me LMAO
Giving the Remus Lupin in my head when I read the books vibe
Whenever I watch your videos I feel like i watch my other personality, is that make sense? I mean I feel happier and completed. Nevermind idk how to explain this. lol  Well anyway, love you and wish you all the best <3
Also my comfort movie is Food boy, especially after a scary movie. Particularly when he produces bread out of his hands in the bathroom, I highly recommend this miraculous film.
ITS BEEN 3 MINTHS
YESSSS!! I'm listening to Sweet Boys for the 6th Time because I miss Garrett and Andrew so so much! It's been a blast but I'm excited for new content!!! I love you Garrett!
My comfort movie is the Fifth Element. 💙
Garret, you look good with that beard ❤️
Omg yay!
He looks like a sexy lumberjack
THE WAY THAT I SPRINTED TO THIS VIDEO

Mines is definitely cat in the hat or the grinch ( obviously the live actions ) 😂
A video made bc of Mercury retrograde 🤪
Oh honey. Since July every appliance, drape, piece of furniture and car in my life has broken. And there are no parts to be had. I absolutely feel this.
My comfort movies are Highschool Musical 1 and 2 but NOT 3. I've only watched the 3rd like 2 times and I will never watch it again.
My go to comfort movie is actually batman Forever or Batman And robin(the one where Arnie is mister freeze). Idk why but theres just something about super cheesy/cringe batman that always makes me laugh.
Oh EASY i use to be stationed in japan and I HATE fluffing so before take off I would start watching the sound of music. Who wouldn’t be SO relaxed by the queen herself.
The 2005 Pride and Prejudice movie is my go to comfort movie. I insisted on watching it after getting all 4 wisdom teeth removed to sooth my half sedated soul instead of taking a nap.
20:22 got mini heart attack
Idk what my comfort movie, but videos like yours are comforting content :) Appreciate you!
If Chris Mccandless was a YouTuber. If ykyk
baby i’m worried, we love you
"Zen as hell" is my new favorite thing to say
I'm so relieved Taco Bell brought you back to safety! If you actually read this - my comfort movies are The Grand Budapest Hotel, My Best Friend's Wedding, and Roman Holiday Love you and Taco Bell!
not me wondering why you didn't pack clothes or water and then realizing I'm watching Garrett Watts lmao
Agnostic? Or omnist? 🤔
My comfort movies are Coraline, I Love You, Man, and Lords of Dogtown lol maybe Phantom of the Opera gets an honorable mention as well.
❤️❤️❤️Your uploads make me happy. My confort movie is Resident evil.
Right now my comfort movie. Will more like  shows.  Is" good witch"
I often go stay in the woods. I'm at the beginning of the video.....pause... errrrrm.... I'd think Garrett's tone is more suited to a parade than wild camping. However.... I will reserve judgement.... encore un fois.... play.....
What are you up to now Garrett😂
Amelie is my comfort movie :)
There is no one in the whole world that I relate to more than Garrett watts
Garrett you're so pure. The daddylongleg story 😭🥺
I learned the ‘people can’t say mean things about you if you beat them to it’ at a very young age. 😂
you know when you see the notification that garret uploaded its gonna be a great day.
Garrett: I'm running away into the woods! Also Garrett: Skillshare Segway!!
Not mercury retrograde wreaking havoc your life 🙃 You must be a Gemini or a Virgo 😅😅😅
my comfort movies(+shows) are definitely lilo and stitch SpongeBob the flash

future archaeologist gonna be very confused when they dig up a spider in a coffin. also my comfort movie is stardust :)
Current comfort movie is Demon Slayer: Mugen Train. I’ve had that on in the background so much lately. Lately, any anime movie that slaps me with feelings is comforting to me.

my country movie is RUSH HOUR, AUSTIN POWERS 😊❤️
Lmao the section of the spider is such a mood 😂 i love that you got it a coffin. So much love for such small things.

GARRETT
Comfort movies: Heavy Weights, Life Size (with Tyra Banks), and The Great Mouse Detective
harry potter and the goblet of fire is my comfort movie <3  edit: OH AND THE BEE MOVIE 😩
This video is my ADHD personified
23 minutes in and the blood in hair &  trail of gingersnaps to the car reminds me don’t leave my 🏡 or never to go exploring the woods ⛺️ 🌲 why is little Benjamin still in the car, I have questions, too many
I prefer watch garret than Shane
My favorite comfort movies are Matilda, the Harry Potter films and pride and prejudice.  P.S for your fridge situation try unplugging it for 24 hours and then see if it works again
you are precious. Thanks for the off the rails video :D
My hubby loves 50 first dates!!! I love the Bee Movie when I’m sick- it makes me feel better
Garrett out here living the hermit dream we all fantasize about at work
On the real: the production values on this video are huge! Did Garrett really shoot all of this by himself? I wouldn't believe it, but I also have a hard time believing that Garrett could shoot an entire video with Andrew there and not speak to him once.
Any bad or cringe movies are my comfort movie
I wish when he said "a bear scarecrow" he instead would have said a "bear crow"
my comfort movie is national treasure and the 2 It movies which are 2 very different genres but I always go back to them
I thought Logan’s Paul’s dad was on my recommendation for a second
Fantastic Mr. Fox is my comfort movie!
Omgg I love 50 first dates!! Such a good movie🖤🖤
Saw you on puppet history and wished to see more of you. Now my wish has been granted..this is great!
Garret and Hailey Elizabeth posted on the same day! <3
My comfort movies are probably; Pooh’s Heffalump Halloween Movie, Piglet’s Big Adventure, both Scary Godmother films, and any Barbie movie.
My top comfort movies are the proposal and free guy I love Ryan Reynolds light hearted humor it’s so easy to relax when watching him act idk also 500 days of summer and The graduate
The hobbit is definitely my comfort movie!
Howl's moving castle is my comfort movie
Garrett, you are making me realize that I need to host my ranch as air bnb "escape to the woods" property. Mine comes complete with deer, coyotes, and an occasional bear. 😋 If you ever decide to do this for real again, watch naked and afraid and Alone. These are survival shows where people actually live remotely for long periods of time. I would also suggest surviving in Washington or somewhere not under wildfire threat at the moment, so you can have a real campfire to keep warm by. Supplies you need: Water pot or water bottle filter Knife Fire flint or starter Compass Bear spray Machete or axe for chopping wood Hiking boots or sneakers Wearable sleeping bag (its a real item) Legumes or vegetarian MRE and nuts for protein - someone who lives in the woods 😉
Over the garden wall is a 7 episode tv series but I binge it every fall as my comfort movie
my comfort movie is twilight
Halloween town series are my October comfort movies. HP of course, twilight, and the new free guy is pretty good :)
My comfort movie is either Child’s Play (1988), Howls Moving Castle or Drop Dead Fred.

My fav comfort movie is sixteen candles.
THANK FUUUUUCK I NEEDED A GARRETT VIDEO. GOD UR CHIPPERNESS PUTS ME IN A GOOD MOOD!!

Heathers OR  Beetle Juice  !
Omg I’m literally garret. -tall -“nerdy” -anxious -overthinks -has glasses -takes everything as a sign -and runs away from problems

Believe it or not, when I was going through my mental breakdown the film I watched on repeat 24:7 was Where the wild things are 🌲 Not so sure if that’s my comfort film now as I’ve not watched it since then but If I had to pick one id say that.. or Hook
Gaia💚

Hard question well to me it is but I thought real hard on it but it’s not a movie it’s a show it’s called Good Girls it’s on Netflix and Hulu.
Thats not agnostic, thats pantheism or omnitheism
sometimes i wonder how you stay alive Garrett
Thank you, I needed this.  I do like the modern world and I couldn’t live in the nature because it gets far to dark.
Garrett, I got a pet preying mantis earlier this week, she’s a lady. What shall I name her?

My comfort movie (series) is gilmore Girls. As a movie... maybe love actually
HUZZAH!
My comfort movies are Harry Potter 100% I watch them constantly and my boyfriend always says “again?” Lol
@ 5:18 my thought was, "Garrett! Haven't you read "Devolution" by Max Brooks?! Probably not. Basically no one has. BUT it's about dazzling sophisticated urbanites like yourself moving into the woods and getting eaten by sasquatch!" Get it on audible! It will totally change your mind about the woods thing.    And then I thought, "Oh wait. Too late. He already did it. Well, I guess he made it then, otherwise who edited and uploaded the video?"
Why does garrett’s post didn’t show up in my feed?? I’m late. And I’m almost always online 😑
That was so dangerous! And scary! Have you Never watched David Paulides? Rule No1 never go alone and always take bear spray and a personal location beacon! We live in a world ruled by science and technology Garrett yet a miniscule amount of us understand it! Dangerous situation 😨 beautiful jeep! You left a trail of cookies for bears to find you?

27:11 I can't unsee it now: Garrett really is a variant of Bo Burnham
"Inside era". LMAO.
Practical Magic was my comfort movie all through the height of lockdown! Seriously, I watched it everyyyy single dayyy! Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock being beautiful witches, who wouldn't love that?
Imagine Garrett running into Brian laundry
school of rock is my comfort movie. it’s a cinematic masterpiece and that’s a hill i’m happy to die on ok

I watched this blindly for 7 minutes cuz my app glitching and I thought Garrett was just talking over a black screen in the video lmao

This Rock Chick who is into Japanese and Korean Horror and whose favourite movie is Ichi the Killer, has to admit that her comfort movie is The Princess Diaries 😂
You need a Victoriana era fit to match your hair and beard situation
Yes! A fellow Agnostic ♥️
Shane's return made Garret not want to live in society anymore, me too
Great idea with the bearcrow!
Using this content as a refuge before I'm too far gone
My comfort movie is Sweeney Todd the demon barber,it’s not exactly cheerful but it’s just a masterpiece especially the plot and the songs and of course Johnny Depp ❤️❤️❤️
Why is no one talking about Garrett ordering his car casually haha!
Garrett there's no way you terrible your very good looking no matter if your clean cut or scruffy! So hush it boy! lol love u!
ofc garrett has a detective friend
Is it just me or can garret pitch tune?  The man can sing!
my comfort movie is twilight breaking dawn parts 1 & 2. nothing gives me the creeps and serotonin quite like a cgi toddler
I waited for so long!! 💜
my comfort movie is definitely twilight, theres just something peaceful about the cinematics and colour scheme of the movie :)
"got ya bitch" 🤣🤣🤣
My comfort movies are all three Lord of the Rings movies❤
My comfort movie is ratatouille! When I was a kid I had one of those TVs that only really played movies and I used to fall asleep to ratatouille every night because it was one of the only dvds I had. After the movie played through it would end up on the menu screen and just play the animation and song over and over again I always remember waking up in the middle of the night and hearing it, so comforting lol
comfort movie has to be spy kids 1
they play ERYKAH BADU MUSIC? oh boy
Garret starting looking like a wholesome Reiner 😩💖 and I love it please
"I'll just die and see what happens... LOL." This brought out my witch laugh that scares the crap out of my sister. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
RIP hogwarts
Comfort movie is for sure moulin rouge ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
My comfort movies are White Christmas, finding Nemo, miss congeniality, and legally blonde.
Labyrinth, the one with David bowie in it is incredible
Bo burnham after Inside :
I can’t image what the person will think who finds that little rip sign in the woods 👁👄👁
You are truly an inspiration.  🌠💜
my comfort film is the conjuring 2…yeah
Garrett becomes the Lorax confirmed?
I live in New England and we have a problem with catalytic converters thefts too! I’m sorry that happened to you!
Garrett took this retrograde badly

my comfort movies are heathers and legally blonde
My comfort film is Coraline... which is strange when it was literally the scariest thing in the word to me when i was 11. That and pride and prejudice (the one with colin firth) annndddd Easy A. But my favorite film is a league of their own, its my heaven.
I love watching you 🤩  My comfort movie is white chicks 😂
Yeeeees our favourite hufflepuff🦡💛💛💛 you always make my day❤️
My comfort film is my neighbour totoro. Comfort series is fruits basket though
My comfort film is Stick It but that might just be the bisexual in me
Garrett looks good no matter what, beard or no beard- he’s always a beautiful human.
Not reading coments until I watch the whole video not to spoil it because I’m THAT excited.
Okay, give it up Garrett, we know you know you look insanely hot as a lumberjack! 😂 Also, I’ve also gone through that “research” situation exactly, trying to find wild camping near London. This Scottish girl was very surprised you can’t wild camp in England.
Garrett you are the most wonderful mess! I love it. Oh and also please dont die. I say that for purely selfish reasons as I love your videos
Wtf dude I love you
the cinematic masterpiece the mummy (1999) starring rachel weisz and brendan fraser is the ultimate comfort movie for me
That one specific harry Potter game clip unlocked a deeply buried core memory of mine and completely rewrote my personality 👍
Absolutely loved the video! Really kinda makes me want to leave the house a little bit more!  To answer the question: I'm more of a series person but if I had to pick a movie it would probably be The Emperor's New Groove <3
It's like the homeless guy I walk past everyday came running up to me and started explaining himself out of an ever-building tower of shame consisting of the stares the garbage truck people were giving him everyday. Thanks
High School Musical 1 or Annie are my comfort movies ❤ SO MUCH LOVE FOR 50 FIRST DATES THO
Oh also my comfort movie is A Silent Voice. It's on Netflix right now. Makes me feel like I might survive.
My comfort movie is Labyrinth And coraline And the last unicorn
Mean girls.

Longer Beard is a good choice 😍😍😍
Wow my job last week literally every day in that week there was always something inconvenient happening first the air conditioner broke then got it fix that day and the next day the exhaust broke then the coffee machine broke oh also an onion ring shortage and tomato’s also they attempted to shut down our gas simply because they made a mistake mercury retrograde was a pain in my… this month is definitely spooky 👻 filled with lots of little surprises 🥲
Oh my gosh Garrett you could have died. There’s a reason for the Buddy system. I’m glad you’re okay and no one killed you. Also, that you didn’t get arrested. RIP Bathroom Window Spider
Honestly, my comfort movie is Moulin Rouge 😄 so much sillyness, songs and feelings, it makes me forget about my own life for a bit.
Its okay Garrett, we're all suffering from the mercury retrograde x
Love the Michelle McDaniel music at 16:15 😂
My comfort movie   is  ' Van Helsing'  because it puts me to  sleep.
any movie with gene wilder in it is my comfort movie, Young Frankenstein especially!
my comfort films would be amelie and the hilary duff movie lmao.
I want the answer, WHY DO YOU HAVE THE WHIP?😂😜🧐 Like soGarrett sees and answers this!!!!!!
Garrett, thank you so much for coming back and posting during spooky season. Also, ya look good buddy it’s okay ☺️😆

I haven’t got a comfort movie.. I can’t concentrate that long on one thing but my comfort show is only fools and horses
Look, I love Garrett as much as everyone else, but I will never forgive him for saying the phrase "bear scarecrow" and then not immediately coining "bearcrow."
A comfort movie of mine is 13 going on 30 💖
My comfort movie is 100% The Addams Family, I love spooky season because of the dark cosy nights, it brings back some good memories from the season over the years and I just love the Halloween spirit (no pun intended 😇).  Spooky season is also the beginning of my family’s Birthday season so there’s lots of celebrations and fun things to look forward to!  Ps. We are truly blessed to have a Garrett upload during this Halloween month and I’m feeling cleansed💗
edward scissorhands :))
Garrett looking adorable as always. And I’m digging the beard and longer hair. Love a lumberjack moment during spoopy season. RIP window spider friend.
Where The Wild Thing Are is a gem
Okay YIKES 😳 Only half way thru this video and I’ve bonded with you deeper than I have in the last 10 years 🥲 1. Black cherry seltzer is my fucking JAM. 2. Spirited Away is one of my 3 year old daughters favorite movies (along with Mary and the witches flower and princess Mononoke) and 3. I ALSO JAM TO THE MOULIN ROUGE SOUNDTRACK 😭 marry meeee 😭
24:56 what’s that light?
I have two comfort films: NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM (THe one with the little monkey and the tiny cowboy ) and national treasure(for some rASON? ) ASO FORGIVE THE MISTAKES- i'm so tird
My comfort movies are Jurassic Park 3, Midsommar and the Coldmirror version of Harry Potter
My comfort movie is iron man 2 !!
I just watched a man have a literal mental breakdown for half an hour.
Garrett you are truly a fun person. I had a shit week myself. But ya know what you literally make my day when you post a new video. This made my way to start the day a pleasant one 🥰 love ya cutie mmmmwah!
Garretts videos are always worth the wait 😂 Hilarious as always, you made my day 🤣
It’s like a tall Ed Sheehan 😂😂❤️❤️
I'm... concerned for Garrett. Is he okay?
my comfort movie is Scooby-Doo
I knew I found your channel at the right time, I just watched the 90s room makeover videos yesterday and realized you hadn't posted in 3 months, then bang the next day there's a new video! So excited to watch ❤️❤️❤️
Over the hedge 😂😂
comfort movie is My Best Friend's Wedding
My comfort movie is flushed away aha
I just jumped with happiness, this is what I needed :)
I love
Gosh I love him 😍 everything he does is magical.. he’s nailing adulthood.. he’s still got energy and a sense of adventure.
mercury in retrograde is hitting all of us pretty hard
Ive never been scared of Garrett before but not gonna lie this video both makes me scared for and of Garrett. I hope your doing okay dude.
It’s not a comfort movie but my comfort series is Sabrina the Teenage witch and or Mr bean!
Comfort movies are Catch and Release, & Where The Heart Is. Which was also our camping movie growing up so next time you're in the outside bring where the heart is!
garrett if this all happened during mercury rx........... i'm not surprised
Garret, what a lovely gift during this dark time of plagues and Karens. Comfort movies I adore are The muppets Christmas Carol, it is the greatest version. Also Sweet home Alabama and any of the 80s/90s My little pony movies. Now I have a question for you, what generation of My little Pony is your favourite?
My comfort movie is The Winter Soldier.
Comfort movie is easily Babe (yes the one with the pig) or the first Charlie’s Angels movie. Who could be sad watching either of those?!
Waiting for Garrett to explain why he's wearing a wig.....then realising he isn't 😂 love you Garrett ❤️
Garrett getting a nice cool car finally and we get an adventure out of it too. God! I love you.
first i thought he decided to move into a nice little cabin in the woods or build one. i forgot this is garrett i am watching
Comfort movies are the Twilight Saga, because they're so cheesy, they're good? Depression rears it's ugly head, out comes the boxset. Plus, the soundtracks are 👌
Crimson Peak or The Worlds End :D they are both a bit spooky😂 but I love watching them😂👏
my comfort movie is scream!
Noped out at 00:32 it's a super jazzed Shane. Same voice and way of talking.
“like a bear scare crow “ BEAR crow  MISSED OPPORTUNITY
Idk why he’s so worried about beard considering there are no bears in California I’d be more worried about oh idk maybe mountain lions or rattle snakes or something like that lmao
Escapsim at its finest
Thank you for believing in witches. We believe in you!
i don’t have a comfort move but i do have a comfort series: hunter x hunter
my comfort movie is Mamma Mia, it has 2 of my favourite things. ABBA and Meryl Streep
I think we’ve all been feeling about getting away recently, very relatable. I feel like movies I used to watch a lot as a kid/teenager are comfort movies so I could have a lot but a goodie is John Tucker Must Die but also any Disney movie is comfy to me, honorable mention The Goofy Movie.
50 first dates is one of the best films of all time
Not movies!! But my comfort is the series Friends! <3
Pixar's Onward helps me cry whenever I get overwhelmed and can't do it naturally.
comfort movie : CORALINE  😎😎
My comfort movie is Jurassic Park
this entire video is giving me little red riding hood vibes
My comfort movie is sweeney todd,  but as a kid it was the first Toby Mcguire Spiderman for some reason. I also can really get down on some toy story when I need some real comfort.
The song at 16:20 ive only ever heard as the outro for My Thought Will Probably Offend You. I don’t know what it is but it’s so catchy.
AHH
my comfort movie is Donnie Darko.
i have so many comfort movies!!! Howls Moving Castle, Legally Blonde, The Holiday, My Neighbourhood Totoro and then We Brought A Zoo and Safe Haven for some unknown, probably deeply psychological reasons x
tree falling got me good,  jumped half a foot in my chair
OOOOOOHHHH Comfort movie.... aposlutly the first scooby doo movie...spooky island. HOLY SHIT i love that movie. oh i love it.
My comfort movies are literally any animated Disney movie. And I mean ANY!! Pop on a Disney movie and I will be very very happy!! Ranging mostly from the Silver Age to the Post-Renaissance Era. Any Disney movie after 2009 is a little "meh" like they're good too (Moana and Zootopia uh HELLO), but that Bronze and Renaissance Age man. PHEW! But anyway, yes. My comfort movies are anything animated Disney. Top 5 out of that has gotta be The Lion King, Peter Pan, Brother Bear, Oliver & Company, and The Emperor's New Groove. And to mix it all up, I'd toss Luca into the mix. A new 2021 Pixar film that just has my heart right now <3 ok I'm done spilling my guts baaiiii
My comfort movie is probably 13 going on 30. Loved it since I was around 9 years old. I’m now 26.
My comfort movies are Matilda, mulan, ratatouille, and alice in wonderland
Without a paddle, never fails after a heavy day or uber spooky movie
I’m so glad I’m not the only person who has a cabinet of dead things ☺️
GARRRREETTTTT FIRST AID KITS EXPIRE IN IIKE 5 years THAT STUFF IS not sterile OH
They are steeling catalysts here in Sweden too. It's insane.
Little Shop of Horrors is my ultimate comfort movie.
My comfort movie is the breakfast club
If Mercury retrograde was a video this would be it 😂
I think one of my biggest comfort movies is The Dark Crystal:) ♡
It has some movies in the franchise but my comfort series is Puella Magi Madoka Magica, it's not very comforting, but I love it so much and I just keep coming back to it
my comfort movie is The Mitchells Vs The Machines 😌 i've watched it at least 12 times in the past couple months and its the greatest life choice ive ever made tbh this video was so stressful to watch 😭
My comfort movie is howls moving castle, 100%
Comfort movie is waynes world...dont ask me why but it is 😂😂
Garrettttt II have never related more to anyone holy yeck
Howls moving castle will forever be my comfort movie 🥰
MORE IN THE SPOOKY SEASON PLEASE
This video is 30 mins of footage of me when I don’t take my ADHD meds.
My Comfort movie is IT chapter 1. I don't really like chapter 2 as much as the first one but it's still nice.  Idk but something about the friendship and the little town makes me feel nice.
this was such a joy to watch, love your content garrett - never change <3
I'm sorry I love Garrett but I couldn't watch this video, I feel like he doesn't always yell as much as this and it's just too much it's making my head hurt
You posting is what I needed today
Comfort movies: Airplane, little shop of horrors and hunchback of note dame. Xo
My comfort movie is my neighbor totaro. Although the first time I watched it I was very stressed because I didn't like the little girl going missing and falling on her face all the time not to mention that I thought the mother was dead at the end. But now it's just sweet
Lol wheres the girl you use in all your videos garret?! We miss her 😭❤
GARRREEEETT YAAAAAY HIII
If I could have someone narrate my life it would be Garrett watts 😂 just for how chaotic he can be making it entertaining for the invisible audience
Wow Bo Burnham: Outside looks really great so far
It is truly a sad susses what happened to the bathroom spider, a good friend, amazing long legs, and an overall great spider. RIP bathroom spider 2021-2021, you will be missed.
notice he ran away soon after shane came back👀
I have several comfort movies as well.. the part in 50fd where rob beats the shit out of adam gets me every time LOL! Id sayyy Matilda, or Warm Bodies.. very different movies but that is my answer. I lock it in.
If this isn't the most accurate representation of a Gemini...I don't know what is 🤣🤣🤣💕
i think my comfort movie has to be 'howls moving castle', its so comforting and it makes me feel better and that i should romanticise and enjoy my life more. it always makes me feel safe and smile. i feel this with most ghibli films however howls is the most comforting for me. i think the aesthetic and the soundtrack add to the blissfulness and comfort, it doesnt get old no matter how many times i watch it. i have alot of comfort animes, like sk8 the infinity or yuri on ice for example but my biggest comfort film would be howl :) also im glad you didnt die in the woods also if you want a chaotic comedy anime to relax to i recomend uramichi oniisan, its been brightening my week :))
I like the beard, you look fit as fuck. (British for sexy) 😘🥰
Beetlejuice is my fav comfort movie :) loved the vid, thanks
I went to this fair today and saw a Jeep with a (fake)skeleton inside and istg the person that got out had a Harry Potter bag and I literally thought ‘GARRETT WATTS IN AUSTRALIA???’
Sweet boy, Garrett Watts! Too precious! Loved the video and I love how you try to cram your 6’5” Paul Bunyan self into the tiniest of spaces!
hi Garrett missed u- watching this with my hamster Martha (her comfort movie is G-force)
How are you running away when there's a new James Blake album
My comfort movie is Chicken Run. It’s also the best thing created, ever.
I jumped on this tree falling on my dearest Garrett edit. And my comfort movie is Mamma Mia 🤷
Comfort movies: Notorious (with Ingrid Bergman & Cary Grant) & Spirited Away (Studio Ghibli)
Garette has been downgrading his place for the past months   Next video would be just him living in a cardboard box
Sprited Away, I love the art style
You okay hun?
The only thing that’s stopping garret from being mr. Merlin from shrek 3 is hair
Mercury Retrograde is aaaaalmost over, (which makes technology and communication go all wonky) hang in there Garrett!
Howls moving castle. Absolute comfort film❤️
i dont have comfort movies but i have comfort shows that i rewatch, like jane the virgin and she ra(im gay)
Go explore Ojai deep in dah woods off of Ventura?!!?! Crystal clear water and there's a place, I think called devils punch bowl, where there's a part you get to where there's a hugeeee vertical slab of smooth rock and its like a natural water slide?!!?!?!?  Ojai...go there?!?!! 🙌🙏👏👏👏👏
This was fun but I was worried about you, Garrett. I've seen too many horror movies featuring woods so...
Comfort films, Coraline, Pride and Prejudice, and the angelina jolie Lara Croft films.  ....Feel like that's an odd combination 😅
Shark Tales, Final Destination 3 and Bratz Movie Live Action
My favorite comfort movie has to be Howl's Moving Castle
Oh my god yes comfort movies. My biggest comfort movie is Halloween (1978). Also, Happy Gilmore lol
garret is manic
you are such a gem <3 always love ur videos + comfort movie is les miserables
Garrett: lives in nature Also Garrett: brings a projector, dvd player, and a dvd of spirited away just in case nature isn't The Vibe.😂😂
Missed you <3
This video is litterally a great example for how mercury retrograte can influence ur life xD
My comfort movie is PAUL!
Me: Oh, Garrett is looking good with his beard and all. Garrett: I know I look terrible!
My comfort movie is a trilogy. The Lord of the Rings trilogy(Extended versions to be exact lol), It holds a lot of deep meaning for me and I watched them after very tragic events in my life or for family gathering.
I love u so much yay
the only thing i like about benjamin is his dad
The Holiday is my comfort movie!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️😊😊😊😊😊😊
Your uploads literally make my week
4:54 why the tea cup??? Did i miss something????????????
My comfort movie gotta be coraline
You always upload when im super depressed and need the serotonin… Thankyou, i love you
Garrett m8... Are you cursed some how?
Garrett, you are making me realize that I need to host my ranch as air bnb "escape to the woods" property. Mine comes complete with deer, coyotes, and an occasional bear. 😋 If you ever decide to do this for real again, watch naked and afraid and Alone. These are survival shows where people actually live remotely for long periods of time. I would also suggest surviving in Washington or somewhere not under wildfire threat at the moment, so you can have a real campfire to keep warm by. Supplies you need: Water pot or water bottle filter Knife Fire flint or starter Compass Bear spray Machete or axe for chopping wood Hiking boots or sneakers Wearable sleeping bag (its a real item) Legumes or vegetarian MRE and nuts for protein - someone who lives in the woods 😉
my comfort movie is definitely probably Shrek 2.  And also I can't wait to see what you decide to be for halloween this year.
Your so genuinely so funny 🤣 I love your personality ☺️💕
Garrett you don't look terrible you look like a hot lumberjack
I hope his barber never opens, I'm digging the "I just arrived to the woods but I look like I live here" look
Was I the only one expecting Michelle McDaniel to enter the scene when childish gambino started playing lol
50 First Dates and Sweet Home Alabama are my comfort movies I’m sooo glad you said it
Howls Moving Castle, Labyrinth, Big Fish, Nightmare Before Christmas, Beetle Juice, Coraline, and Stardust
Really glad you addressed everything in the end, I am concerned and being in a rough spot myself, I find comfort in movies like Rain Man, Trouble with the Curve, Safe Haven, A Cinderella Story (with Hilary Duff duh) Se7en aaand The Conjuring.
My comfort movies are the conjuring series, especially the second one and annabelle creation!
I miss your uploads ✨ my favorite comfort movie is Ponyo
AAAA I fucking love garret with all my heart. I missed our lil spooky boy
I have two very different comfort movies and they depend on the season. If it's spooky month - it's What We Do In The Shadows by Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement. It's a mockumentary about vampires from New Zealand and there's now even a T.V show based on the idea other characters, but the film has a soft spot in my heart. And of course, if it's summer or spring - Mamma Mia by Phyllida Lloyd and Ol Parker without a doubt. Musicals just have something in them, and I can't really describe it, but Meryl Streep just carries me through.
my comfort movies are harry potter movies, Freaky Friday with Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, 13 going on 30, and Liar Liar
my comfort movies are the parent trap and all the hp movies but especially 3,4, and 6!
My comfort movies are harry potter and the philosopher's stone, Closer (which is dramatic and kind of sad but I love it so much and its seen it so many times that it feels like home) and probably Venom tbh because it's so ridiculous and fun I love it. Also Home Alone 1&2 but I only watch them in december those are the christmas rules.
my comfort movie is "ma vie de courgette" or in english "my life as a zucchini" and it's not at all whta you expect!!!
So comfort movies: the only one that came to mind was princess bride BUT for COMFORT TV SHOWS: the office, scrubs, the clone wars, and just recently the bad batch. OH and the mandolorian. I have a short attention span so movies aren’t really a huge comfort thing to me unless I’m hyper focused on it and it’s one of those days but you know those are random.   Anyway, loving the content and your chaotic energy! Hope you are staying safe!!!
GARRETT: please please please move out of LA you can do so much better and grab a van to travel and live in. WE WILL WATCH THAT. And bonus, you might enjoy it :)))) <3
Garett honey, just move in with Jefree and satisfy him before you die from starvation or whatsoever......
My comfort movie is howls moving castle (:
Bruce Almighty is a comfort movie for me. It's so dumb, and I love Jim Carrey's cartoonish humor.
Wine girl is finally gone, but she still haunts me in my sleep paralysis nightmare
Love u sm garret ❤
what was the light behind your head at 24:55
I feel like you would more be classified as an omniest rather than agnostic. Omnism believes there is truth in all religions, but that no one religion has it all right. Whereas agnostic is more like an atheist where they don't necessarily believe in a God, but they also don't know that there isn't. I consider myself an Omniest.
my comfort movies are hereditary…and how to train your dragon, specially the first one but the second one too. i haven’t seen the third one enough but the last time i watched it, it made my adhd hyper-fixation brain go nnnnnnnnnnnneeeeeoooooowwwwm
My comfort movie is 100% interview with the vampire
The Wedding Singer.
I got my catalytic converter stolen back in July… most heartbreaking thing to happen to me. My car is my life line. It’s how I would get to work and spend nights I couldn’t find somewhere to crash. The one night I stayed at a friends house… I’m so sorry this happened to you Garrett! Much love xx
Comfort movies:  all the Harry Potter films and anything Tim burton; specifically nightmare before Christmas, corpse bride and sweeney Todd.
If you want green my offer for the werewolf forrest collab is still up for grabs just saying lol
My friend walked in and was like "why is Garrett in the woods?" and I answered "oh don't worry, he just couldn't get a haircut" ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
Man i have so many comfort movies. But one that always comes to mind is Princess Mononoke. I don't even like ghibli movies that much honestly, but that one I'll just always come back to
I truly do love you!! I hope you realize how much good your doing just by uploading! So many of us need this time to just laugh. Along with you that is lol
That's just not Agnostic means 🙃
Idk if I was seeing lights or eyes in the background in the dark woods. Probably just lights tho
I never how much I wanted to watch a silly video by Garrett Watts until finding out he has posted a new video!!!
My comfort movie is Shrek for sure
So Garrett went into the woods to bury a dead body... Cool
Comfort movie would have to be nightmare before Christmas. Reminds me of snuggling down with my mom and step mom to watch it once the night before Halloween and once on Christmas eve. Happy days :)
Comfort movies or shows. Charlie's Angels, Friends and To Wangfu thank you for everything Julie Newmar.
garrett have you heard of The York Ghost Merchants Shop in York, UK? its an amazing little store full of tiny ghosts that you can buy! i feel like you would love York, its the most haunted city in the uk, and there's loads of harry potter stuff!
Watch "Over The Moon" on Netflix too!!!! :)
While I'm sure he was playing it up for the video (hopefully) I was really glad Garrett didn't get seriously hurt, and he definitely should've prepared better for being out in the woods. Some of my comfort movies: The Lion King (Original animated one, or any of the classic animated Disney movies), The Wizard of Oz, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Homeward Bound, Forrest Gump, Pokemon 2000, Titanic, Mortal Kombat 1995, Babe, Rugrats in Paris, Home Alone, The original Jumanji, Wild America, Jungle 2 Jungle, the original Winnie the Pooh, Beetlejuice, The Land Before Time, The Nutty Professor, Big Daddy, Who Framed Roger Rabbit ect...
This was a lot scarier than the haunted hospital tbh
Dang, Mercury retrograde did dirty on you
i have sooo many comfort movies like harry potter, lord of the rings, mean girls, marnie (honestly all of the ghibli movies), forrest gump, dirty dancing and barbie movies, to name a few
wonder how long it’d take for garrett to catch me in these comments 🦫
Castaway is my go-to comfort movie
My comfort movie is definitely Mathilda :D
My comfort movie is the Wizard of Oz. There's no place like home with the people you love.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire or Frozen 2 specifically 🥰🥰
This is the Mental breakdown...  I live for ...
my comfort movie is LUCA!!! i’ve watched it about 5 times now <3 me and my boyfriend love it so much ^__^
hey Garrett, sick vid. my comfort movie is the witch with Anya Taylor joy :)
oh all my comfort movies are animated: Zootopia, lilo and stitch, kung fu panda 2
Excuse me is the background song Giddy up Higher gang 😂😂 um in love.. ( um well aware it's not but I did think it was )
now that i think about it, my comfort movie has to be shrek (1 or 2 it doesnt matter)
My face hurts so much because i smiled throughout this whole video 😭😭
If your freezer works, your fridge works. Cool air is blown from the freezer into the fridge. What has likely happened is that condensation has frozen around the fan and is preventing it from blowing the cool air into the fridge. Unplug the fridge and let is sit for awhile so it defrosts, and then plug it back in and you should be good.
Garrett's search history is oddly relatable!
My comfort movie is The Holiday 🥺
My comfort movie are pixar UP,Meet the Robinson and Wall E. 😊😊😊
If your freezer is cold but fridge is warm your freezer might be over packed or you need to defrost with the doors open for a couple hours
My comfort show is bobs burgers! I fall asleep to it every night to distract me from my anxious thoughts!
MY COMFORT MOVIE IS COCO 😭
I don't watch a lot of movies but two from childhood that are favorites and I could watch over and over is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and of course the original Grinch That Stole Christmas LOL I'm such a child. Same dude i come alive in Oct too not only do i love Halloween but ITS MY BDAY MONTH! Woot! lol ILY xo
my comfort movie is the night at the museum trilogy lol
this video is pretty much what my manic episodes look like so its funny and interesting to see this from a  pov perspective 🤣  and to answer your question about comfort movies i have quite a few but my three TOP comfort movies include fantastic mr fox, suburban gothic IT chapter 1&2
My comfort movie will always be Lilo and stitch. It's my favorite movie in the whole world and it always makes me happy when I watch it.
Your giving me WWE ,McFoley vibes and I am here for it.
my comfort movies are the live action scooby doo movies. because im bisexual
My comfort movie is definitely anything Disney especially monsters inc. idk it’s just so nostalgic and great so yeah 😂👍
My comfort movie has got to be Coraline, been loving it since I can remember, and for series cause I watch more of those than movies, it's a tie between Gravity Falls and Over The Garden Wall
My comfort movie for some reason is the Book of the Atlantic
i'm generally curious: do you have a job? (exept from YouTube)
Mine and my family's comfort movie is Just Go With It. It's so funny!
Comfort movie!? I have so many! But if I must pick one above the rest: IRON GIANT, I pack-bonded with that big robot man and never looked back, catch me out here crying every time. Also the older I get the more I identify with the junkyard artist Dean McCoppin!!
my comfort movie is either the greatest showman or Matilda
Garrett is actually a good singer!
I am so appreciative that you had a scary night for our benefit. I had a very long week, and watching your video while I giggle and eat a cheese stick made me so happy. Thank you. 😊 Oh and: HP Sorcerer's Stone, Howl's Moving Castle, The Goonies, or the Aunt Irma episode of The IT Crowd.
My comfort film is TWILIGHT 🧛‍♂️🐶
My comfort movie is the Ratatouille movie!
Mercury retrograde isn’t treating you so well
This is probably the most I’ve heard Garrett curse. It’s great. I’m enjoying it.
My comfort movie is just go with it its not that great but I’ve watched it too much
My comfort movie is Alice in wonderland and all the Harry Potter movies
My comfort movie is, hmmm I would definitely say Harry Potter is in that category too for sure, and I absolutely love Fifty First Dates also, it’s one of my boyfriend and I’s favorites! 😄  I am trying to think if there is any others off the top of my head. Watching the Descenants movie series as well as the Divergent series are also comfort movies for me. I just really love them. ❤️
I feel like Garrett and I share the same specific manic braincell I too have way too-many things that I attach personalities to
Garrett really said "come what may" 🤷‍♂️
Comfort movie: The Devil Wears Prada <3
I got so used to Bearded Garrett in this one video <3

R.I.P Garret's bathroom spider. You will be missed. 😔
“ITS A BAT!”
GARRETT! I have a question for you! It's my favorite "get to know you" question. Which of The Seven Deadly Sins is yours? Pride, Lust, Sloth, Gluttony, Envy, Wrath or Greed? Mine is Gluttony. Weird question, I know, it's just one of my favorites to ask!
THIS IS A SIGN ! I had talked to my bf about leaving my car parked outside at the curb and that way I can go anywhere I want without having to ask his family  about moving cars around in his closed off (by a gate) parking spots. I just heard about one of our friends cad had been stolen in the middle of the day. And now I'm watching Garrett's new video with the same issue. HMMM it's a sign.
Garrett looks like that guy from attack on Titan here, the beast titan guy I think it was
My comfort movie is any old barbie or monster high film it's so nostalgic for me
i love u garrett
My comfort move would have to be a silent voice for sure!
The beard is such a look on him!!! Go awf Mr. Watts😌
Also... how many times have you smacked you face with that bull whip, I call mine Indiana.
My comfort movie is Alice in Wonderland (Disney animated version) and also Spirited Away. Both of those I have watched often while I was sick and it's like a get better movie to me!
I love when you upload videooosss
my comfort movies: dr strange, ragnorok, captain marvel, avengers, knives out
I would love to watch this right now but I am going to save it until it's dark and spooky, I have a bag of peanut m&ms, my dinosaur slippers on and my best frog by my side.
Is it sad that I don’t have a comfort movie? I don’t enjoy movies much. I also think that’s sad. Maybe I should try to watch movies more…
I just wanna date and cuddle the pure out of this man <3
My comfort movies are old classic fantasy movies! The Dark Crystal, Princess Bride, Labyrinth, The Neverending Story, Willow, etc. Always nice to go back to because they were also my childhood movies despite being born in the early 2000s lol
Love you Garrett! I always get so happy when I see you posted a new video! ❤️ 👶
my comfort movie is clueless and also dirty dancing and also rocky horror picture show OBVI
I dunno about comfort movie but adventure time Is for show a comfort show to me. I've rewatched all of it chronologically many times lol. OOOO also marvel movies, especially Captain America ones
My comfort movies are Big Fish and actually also the first Harry Potter movie. My friends actually know to put the Potter one on anytime my anxiety gets out of control 😅
Your beautiful inside and out Garrett 🖤
Are we just not going to mention the spine on the side of the road
my comfort movie is 10000% Moulin Rouge!!! for five months straight i watched it 2 times a night and sobbed and sang along to it. it is beautiful and ive loved it since i was like 3 years old which is far too young to love such a movie smh.
"Practical Magic" and "Under The Tuscan Sun". ...and yes, I'm a 78 year old cat-lady, in a 32 year old male body. I'm aware.
My comfort movies are Mean Girls, Lord of the rings, and The craft
Missed you Garrett!! 😭♥️ My comfort movie is Twister. Which is odd because it’s also terrifying to think about it being reality lol.
My comfort movie is... all of the Harry Potters 😂😂(specifically the first one for comfort), Pirates Of The Caribbean 1, and it's not a movie, but I love The Goes Wrong Show by Mischief... it makes me feel cozy 🥰
Lumberjack Garrett is a mood
It seems like every YouTuber I follow is starting to move away from LA, is it getting that bad? Yikes. I live near Seattle, and Downtown Seattle is getting really bad too.  Are you fully moving or just getting away for a bit? Sorry to hear about what happened to your car too. That’s rough. ❤️ Later in the video: oh I see it was one of those silly crazy idea videos, glad you didn’t stay out there too long. The whole time I was like “just sleep in the car” 😂
Why is the preparation portion of Garretts videos always more entertaining than the actual activity but anyway I used to love Tom and Jerry The Movie from 1992
Mine is Girl, Interrupted.
This video is a psychological cry for help and I've never related to anything more in my life 🥲🥲
my comfort movie is 100% Tangled. Pretty colors, amazing songs, great story, I watch it everytime I'm bored or need a pick me up. Also wtf was this video and are you ok? XD 10/10 would be confused again
Run away to my sweet sweet sweet area....  you will be afraid, more scared than the hospital.  I love you and your face.  It must be hard, I know.... shit happens to me all the time.  Fuck catalytic converts, without it your car just sounds more bad ass!  .....if that's even possible.  Ps I said that before you said you wanted to run away.  I'm in Canada, north of Oregon. Pps There's cell service   Kinda strange
Your laughter is the highlight of my day. By the way, I'm so jealous of your woods-y life!
Got bummed because my month has been going badly and was going to go watch your ice cream video again then saw you posted today. This is just what I needed. Maybe I should go live in the woods too. My life is a wreck. Where's my flannel?!  P.S. Sorry about your Hogwarts
I tried playing my dvd copy of Spirited Away tonight, and my tv kept telling me "disc dirty", and I didn't know what that meant, because I couldn't see any dirt. So I tried cleaning it, but it STILL didn't work. So I gave up, and watched Harry Potter. The first one.
I love Benjamin
How is Garrett single??? He funny asl and Supa cute! 😭💓
Garrett is what I feel like would happen if all my manic thoughts manifested into a physical form
my comfort movie is The Last Unicorn
At least you learned a bit about what you need next time. Like it's good to go out to nature every now and then, but you were far from prepared. But at least you went out and did something!  Also, I know there's some drama with Tim Burton, but my comfort movie has always been Edward Scissorhands
my comfort movies are ponyo, princess and the frog and the nightmare before christmas
My comfort move rn is without a shadow of a doubt luca, it's just so wholesome
someone stole the cadillac converter thingy from my dads car
Ferngully the last rainforest, tucker and dale vs evil, help I’m a fish, the secret garden AND triangle. My 1-5 top comfort films.
I love Garrett but he really did Shane dirty
My comfort movie is The Last Jedi
If you don’t buy a bike istg
Prince of Egypt 😎
I’m personally offended that he went with “bear scarecrow” and not “scarebear” or “bearcrow.”
Comfort Movies: Drumline. Or Breakfast Club.
sounds like u need to defrost ur fridge bro
Andrew, please rescue your friend... 😂😅
Thank you, Garrett for this chaotic and entertaining video. I’m getting prepared to say goodbye to my 20 year old cat any day now. You are always a comfort for me. Also, my comfort movies are Addams Family (the 90s ones), Scary Movie 3, and any Godzilla movie.
i dont know why but my comfort movie is bad moms....
My comfort movie is Battle Royale xD
I genuinely love Garrett! He's a treasure 🎃🍂🍁
I don't know when you filmed this..but the mercury retrograde really gets everyones electronics and anything communication related like your car.. im sorry that happened to you.

Blair witch vibes 🤔🤣
When I saw the tent size: “why is your tent… not a tent” I don’t know why I expected more LOL
My comfort movies include: harry potter 1-4, Sweeny Todd, never ending story, and practical magic. I also used to watch Moulin Rouge once a month, but i think I burnt myself out on that one lol
Thank you so much for posting. 💖 It has been an emotional month and your video truly lift me up. Your content and personality is one huge beautiful gem 💎
this is literally the blair witch project
Yes Garrett finally out from the trenches and now into the woods
Honestly my comfort movie is spirited away and when you pulled it out on screen I like LITERALLY freaked out!!! 🥺🥺🥺

Comfort movie: Free Willy. All of them. Yes all.
my comfort movies would be Mr. Peabody and Sherman, and Labyrinth the movie made in 1986. also I'm glad you are alive lol:) seriously tho you never fail to make me happy or bring my mood up!
this video is “Into the Wild” but with a happy ending and you can’t convince me it’s not
it’s strange knowing that somewhere in the world there is a tiny lil spider grave that no one will ever find
1. Are we not gonna discuss the fact that Garrett finding the bones was the funniest thing to ever happen 😂😂  2. Coraline is my all time comfort movie hands down!
I loved this video so much! Garrett has such wonderful energy and he always makes me laugh. I rarely leave comments but this video had me feel so many wonderful things especially being someone who would spend every summer in the beautiful mountains so I some knowledge that I would like to share in case you go back to the mountains again (with Andrew hopefully! I would love to see you both out in the wilderness having fun). First, unrelated to camping but in this video you look like Rhett’s long lost twin and I died of laughter at your search history! First bit of nature info, the vast majority of bats are not harmful! The only bat the sucks blood is the “vampire bat” which usually suck on cow blood, but if they do bite humans (which is fairly rare) they do it when the human is asleep. While you sleep, they bite the tip of your nose and take only a little bit of blood (vampire bats are actually very small so they don’t take that much blood) Usually, the bite is supposedly painless as most people don’t know that they were bit until they wake up and see two tiny dots on the tip of their nose. However, maybe get a rabies shot if that happens, but most people act like if they are bit by a vampire bat that it’s going to suck out all of their blood and like I said they only take a little bit of blood. Also, I believe most bats enjoy snacking in insects and fruits the most. Bats are such cool creatures which people freak out but most bats are usually harmless. Unrelated to nature, I can only imagine what it would have been like to be pulled over by police with several skeletons, a demented doll, a bear costume, a shovel, and a keyboard! Lol! Going back to nature, bears are so cool! They are majestic creatures and I love them, but they can be dangerous when people who don’t know the protocol for dealing with bears. Hopefully, this will help you if you go back out into nature. If you see a bear, and it is approaching you or too close for your comfort, you are supposed to make yourself as big as possible (fully extend your arms out, go up on your tip toes etc) and make LOTS of noise. Definitely do not try to run or attack the bear because that is a fight you most likely will not win. Bears are incredibly smart, gorgeous, and strong! Our camp had “bear proof” dumpsters which was supposed to be made to prevent bears from getting in there and digging through the trash for scraps and making a mess…the bears figured out how to open the dumpster which was like solid metal with some sort of crazy locking mechanics so I would not aggravate them and definitely keep your distance! Most likely they will leave you alone if you leave them alone. It is really cool and quite majestic to be in the close (but safe distance) vicinity of a bear. I have been lucky enough to see bears in the wild “close” up. There you just stay quiet and watch, don’t make sudden movement or loud noises as that will frighten it and put you on its radar as a threat which you don’t want. If that happens then using the getting big technique as I mentioned earlier is definitely a lifesaving thing to know. Stamp your feet, yell, scream, bang pots together if you have those while making yourself as big as possible. Also, when in the woods do NOT leave any food in the car! Bears have an incredible sense of smell and they will break into your car and steal your food! We one time had bear paw prints around the car and ON the car window! Thankfully, we did not have any food in there because that bear would have smashed in the window (they have big strong paws). When in the woods you should hang your food in a bag and put it high up in a tree with a rope (preferably a tree that is a little ways from your setup spot so you don’t lead the bear directly to your tent) (Also, I should state that hanging your food may not be the best way to go anymore as I’m sure they probably sell certain camping supplies now designed for that, but I’m not sure. I always thought it was strange to hang up your food when we know that bears can climb trees…so maybe pick a skinny tree that won’t hold the weight of a bear but isn’t so fragile that the bear can push it over). Bears are such amazing creatures and when people don’t know the proper protocol to use that’s when bear attacks happen and then they have to put the bear down. Bears have such a sad history with humans hunting them to the point of near extinction so knowing the protocol you protect yourself and you protect the bear. Also, if you see a mama bear with a cub…Stay as far away as possible because mama bears will do anything and everything to protect their Cubs! The cubs are cute but admire them from a long distance. Also, I’m so glad that you mentioned that while it was fun to go into the woods definitely don’t go alone. So many people think they can just go into the woods and hang out but it really requires a decent amount of knowledge (which you may be able to find in your Boy Scouts handbook) but there’s so many things you need to know like how to deal with wild animals, where to put your food so it’s safe, knowing how to care for insect/animal bites (specifically rattlesnake as they like to chill out in the California woods and it is vital to know how to act quickly to prevent the venom from going too far into your system. Also ticks are in the woods so wear long pants, long socks, and sneakers and don’t pull out a tick if you don’t know how because if the head of the tick comes of then it’s not good as it’s head will remain in your leg or wherever it has latched on to you), knowing how to safely build a fire and how to properly put it out. And also as a Californian I would just say don’t do it. The forest is so dry from the drought it’s basically kindling. We lost most of our beautiful Sequoia National Park because of the wildfires and it’s truly devastating. But I’m glad you are safe and didn’t encounter any bears or perhaps a forest ranger who would come after your for allegedly trespassing! I would love to see you learn more about how to survive in the wild because the woods are truly beautiful and I would totally be down to watch you and Andrew become savvy mountain boys! (Also really looking forward to season 2 of Sweet Boys!!) I hope you are well and weren’t bleeding too much from your adventure! Sorry for the long nerd comment, I just love the woods and I want people to spend more time in the woods and mountains and be safe as well. My favorite comfort movie is probably Disney’s Girl vs Monster.
rocketman, the elton john biopic is my comfort movie !! hope ur doing ok garrett

Comfort movies: Harry Potter and EVERYTHING
My favorite comfort movies are squishy rom-coms, like The Proposal, Kate and Leopold, and Made of Honor.  50 First Dates is definitely on the list; a lot of Adam Sandler's stuff is really great comfort movie material. If not up for a rom-com, movies like The Labyrinth are also fabulous.
Okay at the abandoned trailer and I miss urban exploring now 😭 I'd always end my exploring trips with fast food too. McDonald's or Taco Bell are my go to's.  Now I want Taco Bell 😭
Comfort movies prisoner of azkaban or dirty dancing gotta be one and two

Garrett, keep being a freakin star ⭐️ I’m not on my phone a lot and def never on YouTube but you’re the only person I’ll actively check for and wait patiently on (veeeeery patiently sometimes). You’re incredible and your energy brings me so much joy. Please always remember to take time for yourself and stay safe ❤️

I literally was just thinking 30 mins ago about how i havent seen a video from you in a bit
Perks of Being a Wallflower is totally mine! I cry every time
Commenting at the beginning: Garrett, it’s always wonderful seeing your happy face. Your laugh makes me believe serotonin exists. Love you ❤️
My comfort movies are the first 3 harry potter movies, Rocky Horror Picture Show, Frozen and Frozen 2, Luca, Petes Dragon, some mlp stuff, barbie stuff, hocus pocus, disney stuff obviously
50 First Dates is a great comfort movie. I haven't seen it in years! Garrett, if you see this, go watch Now & Then, about how 4 young girls experience a summer that will change them forever and bring them back together in adulthood. You'll love the cast, lol.
Coco, Coraline, && Labyrinth are my top comfort movies.   Also, I grew up about 90 miles outside LA. && when you were going thru the desert, I swear it looked like the Cajon Pass. Lol. I lived right at the top of that mountain.
I'm not sure if I'm zoning out and missing things or if it's just that chaotic
The timing of this was perfect. I was literally just spontaneously revisiting the previous video before this one dropped. Thank you, Garrett! You're a diamond!
My comfort movie is definitely the little princess Bc it makes me sob every time I watch it😀✨
Honey, baby, sweetie… run these ideas by Andrew, huh?
One of my MANY comfort movies is 13 going on 30. Sometimes ill be in a really bad slump then i realize i just haven't watched 13 going on 30 in a while.
my comfort movie is the great Gatsby 100%
This sounds dumb but I love watching horror movies so mine would have to be 13th ghost as my comfort movie lmao. I watch horror to fall asleep 🤣😅
Can’t tell you how much this calmed me down from my anxiety. Garrett you’re the real MVP.
Honey ngl that beard on you is super sexy
My comfort movie is But Im a Cheerleader
This is just Bo Burnham: Outside
I hope you're doing okay Garrett <3 I love you
nobody’s talking abt the whip  ..garret u kinky bastard💀
Fantastic mr. Fox
Loved this so much! My comfort movie is Moulin Rouge, I've seen it at least a million times
BESTTTT COMFORT MOVIES: Coraline, Aquamarine, The Spiderwick Chronicles, Twilight, Scott Pilgrim, Robots, The Spongebob Movie, Hairspray, Perks of being a Wallflower
My comfort movie has to be either Pride and Prejudice or these really cool animations called The Book of Kells and Azur and Azmar: The Princes’ Quest I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM❤️Both have these INCREDIBLE and vibrant art styles that are so unique, and they have their roots in inspiration by Celtic and Arabic stories. There’s so many cool and fascinating cultural insights and mythological creatures too, you can’t help getting sucked in. It’s just so different and honest in the story telling compared to other animations—it’s like a feast for the eyes and the heart
To be fair, There have been a lot of Catalytic converter thefts up here in Minnesota too.
Always trust your taco bell instinct. I once went on a midnight drive with my brother and we ended up in Mexico with no passports and it all could've been avoided if I had just trusted that taco bell instinct to get those cinnamon balls
It’s kind of a movie but Metalocalypse doomstar requiem makes me feel so many emotions
Seeing this video on my subscriptions took my breath away! XOXO
at 24:59 your voice sounded like winnie the pooh ^_^
You make me so happy
I have lots of comfort movies, off the top of my head I'm most prone to rewatch The Neverending Story, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Hoodwinked, and any Scooby Doo media
Am I the only one wanting Garrett, Andrew, and Drew Monson to get together and do a camping video where they just goof around and prank call places?
My comfort movie is probably the How to train your dragon trilogy
I don’t care if the pug has bones, I know it’s gonna be a rad day when Garrett uploads
Garrett pls pls pls watch The Way Way Back. It’s like my childhood in a movie and every time I watch it I’m retraumitized but comforted at the same time. :) love youuuu
my comfort movies are perks of being a wallflower & twilight (I am indeed mentally ill <3)
Garrett looks like he should be a hippie 🤣❤️
The holiday
This video gave me so much anxiety!!! I camp off campground sometimes and this made me worry every time you said you didn’t know where you are. Lol
My favourite part of these videos is the thought of a new viewer watching and thinking that Garrett is joking when talking about all the things he’s planning on bringing just to quickly realize he was being dead serious the entire time.
Are lobsters immortal.     Completely reasonable google search.
Thanks for posting babes!! Love it ! Your great ..you make me laugh thank God I've been down .. ugh LIFE.. LOL THANKS!!
Spirited Away is a necessity in every situation. Smart choice.
My comfort films include Mamma Mia and Pan's Labyrinth.
Legitimately looked yesterday to see if there was anything at all I hadn't seen to wake up to a notification of a new video. Fuck yeah!
I feel like I manifested this video, I was just missing you!

I am genuinely missing my skin because I cringed so hard it fell off that you have the audacity to wear SANDALS in literal mounds of dead and dry pine. Where spiders have wild spider orgy sex parties

I work at a wedding and Banquet Hall where we give free rides home and some awful human/humans decided to come and steal three Cadillac converters out of the vans that we used to drive people home so that they don't drive home drunk it's awful that people feel the need to steal to make themselves feel better but I love you Garrett and have been watching you for so long and I just had to share that story with you I'm so sorry that they did that to you I hope that the mechanic can fix it soon for you💖💖💖

Garrett—during the first .035 seconds of this video my first thought (I’m a lesbian btw) was OMG HE’S SO HOT 🥵😍—and then I had to listen to you talk about how much you didn’t like your appearance. You look great, you really do, keep up this amazing work and love yourself a little more pls 🥰

My old house was haunted. Best way to put it. Sometimes I would get so scared I'd have to sit at my husband's office until he'd get off work and go home with me. So...whenever he had to travel or wouldn't be there I'd have to watch Moana in order to fall asleep. Now we live in Hawaii and I don't have a haunted house...yet XD
Pride and Prejudice is my comfort movie, if I watched it a million times I’d want to watch it again - the costumes the music the ROMANCE. SO good
garrett is always complaining about how he looks bad but he looks rlly attractive <3

I'd have to say Disney's Hercules, Fantastic Mr. Fox, What We Do in the Shadows, and Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas. My aunt had it on vhs and I used to have sleepovers with her all the time. I used to sit on the floor in front of her bigass bubble screen and i'd watch Nightmare Before Christmas over and over again, that's the first one that stuck with me. All of the other ones are the same though. I find a movie I like, and I watch it once or twice a day, everyday. Love you, Garrett!!
I think my comfort movie is nightmare before Christmas. I will drop everything to see it if I notice it's playing on TV ☺️

Small note about the catalytic converter theft thing, from a mechanic, it's not even close to only Las Angeles XD they are stolen left and right in NC and basically everywhere. They steal it and then post it for sale for an outrageous amount of money and because of the shortage of catalytic converters from them being stolen, said thieves make loads of money
Man best comfort movie is flushed away
i feel like i have periods of specific comfort movies, where i'm really fixated on one particular movie, but once that period passes i usually forget about it lol   but my last comfort movie was Mune, Guardian of the Moon. And Rise of the Guardians was before that
My comfort movies are Spider-Man into the Spiderverse, WALL-E and Rise of The Guardians. Oh and it’s not a movie but OHSHC and as well as Death note :)!

corpse bride and any back to the future !
Mine is halloween town or Shiloh!!!!
Garrett, you never disappoint. It is truly amazing the content you are able to create!   After thinking about my comfort movies, I have more than I thought:  Ratatouille, Alice in Wonderland, Emperor’s New Groove, Halloweentown, Scary Godmother: Halloween Spooktackluar (2003), Scooby-Doo (2002). I could watch any of these movies at any point in time and I will never ever get sick of them!
This is a treat.
🎥🎬My comfort movies are: Kikis Delivery Service, the Harry Potter series, any of the barbie movies before around 2012 (because those are the most elite), and pretty much every animated Disney movie. I hope you're doing well Garrett, just have fun with your videos. You having a fun time is the most infectious form of joy ❤ i wish you the best health and safety
Spirited Away and Alice and the wonderland
This entire video was a Garrett mental breakdown
I actually think he looks good lol. I mean, could use a brush or comb, but I’m living for the beard.

Practical magic 💫

Side note. I miss sweet boys so much! 💔
Awww Garrett, thank you for uploading. I hope that the Taco Bell grounded you and tasted earned after a hard day of searching for comforts outside of home, to find that perhaps it was home comforts that comfort you all along ♡ missing you, so good to see you and very entertaining as always! Since you asked, howls moving castle, kikis delivery service, my neighbor totoro, spirited away, tangled ^^

He should meet ervin saunders. Garrett would love to learn about pixies and other things❤
The tree scared the butt out of me. Lol
Honestly people have been seeing synchronicities like crazy lately so don’t feel too bad about it. When certain planets leave or go retrograde it can effect sensitive people. If anyone reads this and decides to be negative or rude, don’t waste your time. I’m not interested in your opinion on the matter😎
My comfort movies are infinity war (even though it stresses me out), thor Ragnarok and oh mean girls hahaha
My comfort movies would have to be anything Horror!! I love scary movies!! My favorites are the classic 70’s/80’s ones with like Jason, Michael, Chucky, etc. My most favorite is Michael Myers!!! I wanted so badly to see the new Halloween Kills tonight but I be had no way to go… anyways love you and hope to see more from you and Andrew soon!!!
If you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there. Garrett, have some compassion for yourself. You bring light to a lot of people, and I hope some of the light can be returned to you. None of us really know what the fuck we're doing. And that's okay. We just take everything day by day and move forward as best as we can.
When is sweet boys coming back
I'll make you a Hogwarts!!!!!!!! I use polymer clay and resin!!!!!!
My comfort movie is Moana ❤️❤️

Right off the bat I have to pause the video to write this because I’m trying to focus but my eyes keep carrying to the tiny hogwarts in the corner and forcing me to imagine tiny people in it learning tiny magic lessons committing tiny crimes with their tiny scarves anyway please put an ant on a windowsill so they can pretend to be professor mcgonagall watching the rowdy kids play quidditch. You don’t have to, but i really want that for them (the ant).
Keep the beard Garrett
mans looking ready to star in the teen wolf reboot and i dig it
My comfort movie is The Wedding Singer
It would be so funny to me if the LA mechanics were responsible for the catalytic converter thefts, yours were stolen, and when you get your car to the mechanic they're like "oh you're in luck, we actually have one that's perfect for your car!" and it's really just your converter.
My comfort movie is Walk Hard A Dewey Cox Story
My comfort movie is coyote ugly
Coraline ive seen it 6000 times and it reminds me of my brother
You live in a cabin behind shane "across the county". I'd be scared too. Ngl.

My comfort movie is the first twilight
Garrett please... you thinking you look bad lowers my self esteem so much because I honestly think you're a gorgeous person and I'm like "if people think THAT'S bad, than what am I?" Also, just want to add that as a trans guy, your look gives me such gender envy it isn't even funny.
I knew it was a bones day
Those things are being stolen off cars everywhere. Super sad.

My comfort movie is definitely Moana

My comfort movie is definitely Dracula: Dead and Lovin' It. I can quote that movie start to finish and it always cheers me up :)
My comfort movie is Kung Fu Panda 2 because the peacock is very funny :]]
okay hear me out, but Shrek the musical, its one of my favorite comfort movies, and is just the best <3
Catalytic converter theft is crazy in the northeast big cities currently
I think my comfort movies are the labryinth with David Bowie and the 1st-3rd Harry Potter. Oh and lotr and the hobbit
this video is the EPITOME of being in a manic episode 😂
Garrett just needed the cow as white as milk, the cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn, the sliper as pure as gold lmao
Garret, even though you've let your beard and hair grow out, let me tell you that your skin is G L O W I N G 💜

My main comfort movie is "The Princess Bride". It always makes me feel better.

Comfort movie I think it's the parent trap, I know the dialogue by heart haha, lilo and stictch is also up there, glad to see you again Garrett (and that this wasn't the last time lol)
3mins into the video and my mind is blown away 🤯 my boyfriend was talking about people stealing some part underneath the car that's worth a buttload of money. He only mentioned it because someone died doing that. Apparently when he lift the car it fell on top of him. So yeah, CrAzY!! I was doubting him that people still did that!! Im sorry that happen to you, I'll continue to watch your video now.
comfort movie- anything from hallmark or disciple me movies lmaooo
You have nothing in the description!  thank you for doing the videos that you have been doing. I am now half or more asleep telling you this.   OK?
My comfort movie is.. Forrest Gump ❤️
my comfort movie is howl's moving castle!!!! i've seen it too many times, my mental health is not good
Two comfort movies:  IT - 1990  The Ghost and Mr. Chicken - 1965   Two movies I turn on when I’m sad, that I can quote the entire screenplay, giggle at the same scene as it was the first, and those are my movies (no one else knows nor cares about them as much as I do).
But where did you buy your adult teddy bear??? I think we can all benefit from this.
ALSO if you haven't heard "boys will be bugs" by cavetown... you gotta. I just feel like it's so your vibe lol (ALSO ALSO I'm NOT going to nag you about sweet boys but just know... I am t h i n k i n g about it o_O)
Mercury in retrograde!
Juno, the secret life of arrietty, the never ending story & it's not a movie but all of adventure time is also a big comfort show/movie!! I also cannot pick just one
My comfort movie is Corpse Bride
This episode is giving me serious the office vibes, you know, the one episode where Michael goes to live in the woods. It’s making me feel like Dwight. The more I watch, the more I’m concerned that Garrett is going to get himself lost and killed out in the middle of nowhere. But I know he has to have survived, or else he wouldn’t have been able to upload this
I have never wanted to be like anyone more than i want to be like you omg. Also coraline is def my confort movie.
Ps please keep makeing more videos every day i miss ya awsome videos  😁😁😁😁🤗🤗🤗🤗❤❤❤😀😀😀😁😁😁❤❤❤ ps. Am happy you made it safe back home in 1 peace !
Garrett you're still doing good with being tidy!! :D Having a lot of stuff is ok as long as its organized-ish!
Comfort movie : Erin brockovich I know ..weird right? 🥴
IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD DAY WHEN GARRETT UPLOADS!! ngl I've also been feeling the urge to run away and escape everything lately. it's weirdly reassuring to know you're going through something similar :) I hope you're doing well Garrett <3 oooh two comfort movies that I can think of rn are Pilgrimage (yes the one with Tom Holland and Jon Bernthal, YES it's a very odd film to be comforted by shut up about it!!) and Fantastic Mr. Fox!!
my comfort movie is Tangled :)
what a sword catch! i'm only this far (10:12 to be exact) and i really dont know if your about to go live in the woods or go camp in the woods for some small amount of time. are u staying in a tent my friend? im scared too and we're not even in the woods yet. where are you going to sleep is all i want to know
Not gonna lie, my comfort movie is Cyberbully, I’ve watched that movie more than I would like to admit….also any Disney movie :))
i dont have a comfort movie but two shows, adventure time and hilda
My comfort movie is Howl's Moving Castle. I used to watch that movie to fall asleep every night for years. I love the music in the title menu and would just have that play all night long. It has also helped me with a few panic attacks. Also, I love that you buried your spider friend.
This is basically the opposite of ‘Inside’ with bo burnham
Lol you look like you'd be such a good outdoorsy man but so misleading 🤣🤣 My comfort movies are all the Harry Potters definitely as soon as I see it's a rainy day I already know we chilling with Harry today!  I also fall asleep to the audio books every night 😅  it's ok I'm ok
NOOO! It’s happening there too? My sister got her catalytic converter stollen twice, TWICE! Don’t move to Colorado either! 😬
Omg! My comfort movie is Turbo 10000% if not, then the second smurfs movie, but I looove snails and Turbo is absolutely adorable! <3
Hey Garett!  I think my comfort movie is definitely “ponyo” or “that’s what I want” music video
i was practicing my makeup while watching this and eyeliner came out good on the first try. thanks garrett :)) my comfort movies right now are tangled and howl’s moving castle. i literally have shrines for these movies in my room i aHHHH THEY BRING ME SO MUCH JOY AND COMFORT, the music especially!!
not the ⚪️ man saying he’s good with a whip 😩🥴
I am also concerned about Garrett coming home to the stench of a broken refrigerator full of food rotting… Been there. It’s… Not fun.
My comfort movies are all of the Shrek movies. The musical is a bonus
My comfort movie is grown ups
You are literally what it’s like to be in my own head 🤣 I love it
My mans really should've brought Andrew cuz holy shit he turned camping into a suicide mission lol
Garrett: worried about bears attacking him. Also Garrett: leaving a food trail leading right to him.
Okay, listen. Comfort movies, here we go. "Ready Player One" is the GOAT. "Into The Woods" is another good one. Anything with Emily Blunt, cause she's amazing. Oh, and Eddie Redmayne (spelling?)!!! Come to think of it, I think I just love all movies. Except horror movies. Those are scary. And scary is bad. Usually. Not when Garrett has scary stuff, cause it's Garrett, and Garrett is cool.
Garrett,  its always the best surprise when you upload!!  Big fish 🧡 even if i cry everytime at the end.
Comfort movie: Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure
Garrett you look sooo handsome!! I love your videos!!
Garrett videos are serotonin.
Mercury retrograde has hit Garrett hard
Weird Science (1985) Very cheesy makes me giggle 😆💕 Nerds generating a girlfriend from a computer gives me comfort that it's a possibility that I wont be forever alone...hahahahaaaaa.. 😐

comfort movies -  omfg you said coco you dickhead, but also scream, 27 dresses, the mummy
Inside is my comfort movie. it embodies all of my painful feelings but done in such a beautiful way that it makes me feel better. But if it’s too harsh for the moment I will watch Trolls and I’m an adult so I don’t tell anyone that…  You also make me feel better, ily Garrett. I strive to be like you, in the ways you love everything and have such a positive energy. I think so often ‘I can just get in my car right now with my Polaroid and potted plants and guitar and notebooks and drive for hours get to somewhere where I feel differently or better’ in search of magic that comes with spontaneity yet I would have a night like yours and go home eventually   My health is getting worse and many things keep piling up it’s hard not to feel trapped. I try to remember to look at the world from a different angle and not get wrapped up in negativity, so I can continue to love life (and spider friends)  Sorry I just wrote an essay here but anyone who needs to hear it: I’m so heckin glad you’re on the planet, I love you, drink some water, get to bed, keep doing what you’re doing, you got this.
A Garrett video? on a BONES DAY! Very nice :)
its the mercury gatorade
“Bring me to woods or no more toes”   I cried
My comfort movie is Stand By Me, I've seen it like 50 times and can quote it. You're so cute I love you Garrett!
My comfort movie(s) are twilight and Harry Potter lol (yes I have two 🙄)
His humor is so niche, its an honor to be able to understand
I always always enjoy ur videos Garrett! They bring joy into my tired life lol💕. My comfort movie would have to be the greatest showman
impeccable timing Garrett, I feel you a million percent, going through the exact same. lets all move to the woods where rent is a lot cheaper and you can see stars and breathe fresher air
I like watching, Hocus Pocus, Titanic, Harry Potter and The lord of the Rings and many more. But if I'm having a hard time I go for Hocus Pocus especially this time of year. I have never seen the Matrix before so I"m currently watching those. I'm excited for the new Scream movie. Sorry I couldn't pick just one. Liked the video by the way.
I have several comfort movies. Spirited Away (which is my all time favorite movie), my neighbor Totoro, Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightly, and It (2017) lol
The missed opportunity of Garrett calling the bear-scarecrow… a BEARCROW hurts my feelings.
My confort movie is coraline something about that little lady throwing a cat at her evil other mother gets me every time ❤ plus talking cat
my comfort movie is little shop of horrors but with the bad OG ending tho
My comfort movie is  Kong Fu Panda  I just relate to the bug a lot
Literally was randomly hoping yesterday that you'd upload soon. Just what I needed during spooky season 👻
My comfort movie is Newsies on Broadway 🧡
Breakfast at Tiffany’s is my comfort movie. Holly talking about the blues and the mean reds has always resonated with me
Holy crap I used to play that Quidditch PC game all the freaking time and the 1.4 seconds of screen time it had were enough to bring back fond memories.   Also, the comfort movie that comes to mind would have to be Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
Comfort movies are definitely treasure planet and howls moving castle.
We have video confirmation that Garrett is a person who says “the floor” instead of “the ground” when outside.
My comfort movie is either scream 1 or 2. You just can’t top it!
my confort movies:howls moving castle, spirt away, kiki delivery service, Hilda tv series is a most , camp rock, lemonade mouth (or most of disney channel early 00´s-10's)...I sure have many more, but i just have in mine this ones...anyway love your videos, greetings from Panama ^^

My comfort movie is the tourist w Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp🤩😩
Garrett won’t get rid of the spider even he buried it in the woods. Spider ghost would still hanging around Garrett’s windows
Oddly enough, comfort movie is Silence of the Lambs. It always seemed to be playing some where on cable every time I stayed home sick from elementary school, so now it’s what I like watching if I’m feeling shitty and want to relax.   Also, as a Trader Joe’s employee, I can clock all the items showing up in your videos. Good choices.
TODAY IS A GOOD BONE DAY!! GARRETT UPLOADED! NOODLE KNOWS ALL!  edit: I spoke too soon.. it's seems like Garrett has NOT been watching the forecast
Wait Garrett, if  you believe in everything you are Omnist, not agnostic. At least to the extent I understand both of this concepts lol I understand agnostics don't believe in anything, zero, nada, nothing at all. They believe that when they die that is the end, while Omnist believes in all but does not practice it, like you give credibility to everything such as you don't pray or go to a mass but still believe there is a god, ghosts, aliens, and more.
Comfort Movies: Beetlejuice, The Greatest Showman, Spirited Away..man I need a lot of comfort lol
top comfort movies: megamind, httyd fims, hairspray, kung fu panda 1 and 2, sing, pacific rim, godzilla 2014, the adventures of tintin, fantastic mr fox, guardians of gahoole and more i probably cant remember rn
I JUST searched the other day for a new video from you. Have also been obsessed with running away ro the wilderness. Coincidence? I think not ♡
My comfort movie is The Sound of Music 💘 my favorite movie/musical in general

I love you too!! <3 I don’t have a comfort movie, as I’ve never been much of a movie watcher (crazy, I know), but I do have comfort series’s!!  Ive spent a large portion of my life consuming digital content on YouTube instead of on a TV or other streaming networks. For me, my comfort go-tos are any GMM episode, Cowchop videos, JackSepticEyes house flipper series, or any cute animal compilation!!
Aw, I was actually coming to comment that I think your long hair looks really nice on you. But I am also entirely feral for Bo Burnham, so that checks out.

My comfort video has been Psych The Musical, but that's mostly because Psych is my comfort show lol

But its not weird. Because I said its not weird. Lol
“ and i’m taking YOU with me”  yay :D
What We Do In The Shadows (by Jemaine Clemet and Taika Waititi) Comfrot movie for the ages

Also comforting MovieS I want to watch are By Alejandro Jodorowsky-.  The autobiographical especially..i think it.  Would interested you Garrett.   I also watched. :The.  Making of Thriller. It is. So cool to be teleported back. To the80ties.

Legally Blonde, Mean Girls and Dolls are some of my comfort movies.

My comfort movie is definitely Twilight 😂
they say you can save wet phones by burying them in white raw (uncooked) rice and letting the rice absorb all the water (somehow)

Come to North Conway, New Hampshire!! Would LOVE to give you a tour
I’ll take your upload over Shane’s any day
My thoughts in the first 3 minutes: "I'm glad I'm not the only one having a massive breakdown" :') Also 100% wanna leave society and live in the woods, probably will die poisoned by some funky mushroom and will finally know what's on the other side hahaha
my comfort movie is Howl's Moving Castle
I *love* the sandals, green cargo shorts, and black and red flannel😂😂👌👌👌
it would be so cool if you were actually prepared with pans and fire and a cool tent... like real camping that would be extreamly cool
For comfort movies, Wall-E is my absolute favourite! It has great music, fun characters, and stunning visuals! I also like to pretend the robots are all representations of different nerodivergencies (definitely not projecting lol) but it makes me feel better no matter what im struggling with! 10/10 would recommend!   Side note: These videos are always so fun and an excellent distraction from the usual YouTube drama so I hope Garrett keeps being himself and bringing positivity to everyone!
Cry Baby!  or really anything John Waters are the best comfort movies to me 😊💗🙏✨
rip to ur spider friend <3
I'm sorry but it just doesn't sit right with me how you and Andrew were so comfortable with getting clout from Shane when he was loved by everyone, but disappeared from his life as soon as he got cancelled. What kinda friendship is that? Y'all were so fast to publicly wish him a happy Birthday and everything when he was the King of YouTube, now nothing. I'm not saying Shane is a great person, but y'all are sh*tty friends and I can't see y'all the same way and can't buy the wholesome imagine anymore. 🙅‍♂️

Fried Green tomatoes is my comfort movie
Honestly, Garrets your videos are my comfort videos/movies🥰 I feel very safe and happy watching your content🤍 but to give you an answer you were expecting I’d say spirited away, a walk to remember, and legally blonde(both the musical and the movie)😁
My comfort movie is Wreck it Ralph =D Love you lots too, bye ^^
Comfort movie definitely has to be scary godmother 🧙‍♀️🧛‍♂️💃✨
Comfort movies- all of the original MIB movies (especially the third one) and Burlesque- but mainly my favourite thing to do with Burlesque is complain about how Jack is also an asshole but we’re meant to see him as the good guy (and he genuinely thinks of himself as a good guy) and it makes no sense. How did I start off with this as a comfort movie because bi and good music and then end up continuously ranting about how Marcus was an asshole but at least he was honest about it.
For some reason I've been watching Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness on repeat - they're just so goofy, I think that's why they're comforting.
Love you too 💜💜😀😀👋👋🕊🕊🕊
Oh my gosh, so many comfort movies. Probably Young Frankenstein, Fifth Element, Big, and top world probably be Willy Wonka (original).
Once he pulled out Spirited Away I felt like me and him became a little bit closer 😂❤️
My comfort movie is Howl's Moving Castle 😭😭💜💜 both in dub and sub!
Howl’s Moving Castle!

My comfort movies are:  LOTR - Fellowship of the Ring and Thor - Ragnarok
Okay but who told Garret to be so attractive 😳
Garrett’s idea reminds me of a book we had to read in fifth grade called “my side of the mountain” a boy from New York runs away from home to go live in the catskill mountains. He makes his own clothes and trains a peregrine falcon.   But tell me he’s going back for the trailer
2:21 Um… sounds like Mercury Retrograde has not been nice to Garrett👀   me watching this being into astrology, I wonder if Garrett knows about retrograde and how it affects cars (his car part getting stolen), communication (phone breaking), technology/useful items stop working (his fridge)  Garrett:something’s telling me to leave Me: uh… well that something might be the SIX RETROGRADES ruling communication, transformation, responsibility, expansion, spirituality, and freedom 🤷‍♀️ (but don’t worry Garrett, things will start to go back to normal on the 18th 😊)
My comfort movie earlier this year was Pearl Harbour?? And now it’s Pitch Perfect
My comfort movie is She is the Man from Amanda Bynes and Legally Blonde
My feel good films are probably any Marvel movie, Lord of the rings ,Harry Potter and the iconic Princess Diary. 😊😆
My ultimate comfort movie is Stardust. It’s such a sweet and charming and funny story.
So... when are you starting this "I'll just die and see what happens... LOL" commune in the woods? And how do we join?
The Princess Bride 🖤
“leeast”
If there are flies it al adds up as in my experience Loki likes to annoyed the shit out of people when he wants their attention...
My comfort movie is emperors new groove, I love it so much and watch it when I’m sad (which is often)
My comfort movie is most likely Pokemon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew
Bro Labyrinth is definitely my comfort movie. It reminds me of my early childhood because I would watch it all the time (not both in the 80s though, we just had it on dvd), it’s a crazy movie that makes almost zero sense, and seeing David Bowie as fucking JARETH the Goblin King is instant serotonin to me. The scene with the orange goblins and the shittiest greenscreen editing I’ve ever seen is so endearing I love watching that movie just on a rainy day it has my whole heart. IT from 2017 is another one but I don’t want to talk about it lol
My comfort movie is the first Pirates of the Caribbean ^_^
As someone who has gone camping and had everything except dry firewood, and had a bad time because of  forgetting just that, I was very anxious for Garrett going off into the woods alone, but he survived thank god! also idk if he was in bear country, but normally when camping in bear country, you need to have all of your food sealed up so they don't smell it and go near you. Oh gosh, sorry I'm being a worry wart! I know it's not a movie, but Adventure Time is my comfort show! It brings me back to childhood and is just such a safe place to be in
You know it’s gonna be a great day when Garrett has uploaded a new video! I love you so much!   The Hobbit trilogy are my comfort movies!
My comfort movie is The Wiz
My comfort movie is The Princess Bride 😌
So are lobsters immortal? I need to know.
POV the cops find this footage on a camera in the woods
My comfort movies are litterally the Twilight movies. I know, i know, and i dont care.
Every year when my Dad and I go to decorate our house for Christmas, there are 2 movies we ALWAYS have in the background: Muppet Treasure Island and The Muppet Christmas Carol (not at the same time)  Totally random choices, but I find both these movies very comforting to watch and enjoy with my Dad not only because he enjoyed watching them with me as a kid, but they instantly put us both in a good mood (plus we crack each other up when we start quoting funny moments in the films and/or we sing along with the songs).  Highly recommend them 😊
A bear almost killed me AND YOU CANT PROVE THAT IT DID’NT. 😂😂
White Chicks is my all year round comfort movie, but if you want to get seasonal, the Scooby Doo cartoon movie where they’re on a zombie island for Spooky Season, and National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation for the Fa La La La La Season
Missed you 😊
ARE lobsters immortal?? did you ever find out!?
For some reason my brain can’t commit to a 90 min movie but will watch 4 hours of 4-8 tv episodes? So I have comfort shows: Psych 🍍and Bobs Burgers 🍔
mr magorium's wonder emporium!!!
Comfort movies, anything old-school disney like Beauty and the Beast, Little Mermaid, and probably the live action Grinch, because Christmas makes me happy and I watch that every Christmas Eve. Oh and Wizard of Oz because that was my childhood favorite and tends to be my on repeat movie to sleep to when sick in bed.
His bo burnham cosplay is next level
the way only rich white people could afford this.....
0:45 I hear you, but listen. When I saw you in this video, I thought "how gorgeous is this man looking right now ? Very." So i respectfully disagree with you.
my comfort movie is definitely either labyrinth or good burger :D
I LOVE YOUUU THANK YOU FOR POSTING TODAY ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
He reminds me of Shane
I've missed you Garrett! My comfort movie is a tie. First, HP6...just because I'm a sucker for the tower scene where everyone is gathered around Dumbledore's body. Second would have to be Star Wars: A New Hope. I grew up watching it, especially when I was sick. Throw in the movie Splash too. Okay, bye!
Moulin Rouge is 100% my comfort movie
Wow Garrett is on speed today !
My comfort movie is ‘Cloud Atlas’.
my comfort movie is Cars, gotta love Lightning McQueen
I was just thinking and watched my comfort movie 2 days ago! Been having the worst time with school and work but The Holiday is the best. So grounding, lighthearted, just so good.
My fave comfort movie is perks of being a wallflower honestly
Garrett uploading is the reason why i'm alive
One man nuh Fi salt a kakafaat.... Hushes massa
ok did NO ONE ELSE hear the bear at 25:06???????
Garrett!!! my comfort movie is 100% Labyrinth with David Bowie. i just love the tiny little British caterpillar in it 🐛
7:17-7:18 so pure 🤍
Love you Garrett ☺
My comfort movie is probably the Princess Bride, but I honestly tend to gravitate more towards TV series for comfort. My faves for a while have been Resident Alien, Brooklyn 99, and Danny Phantom. I feel relaxed just thinking about them, haha.
Mercury retrograde hit Garrett harrrrd
Lumbersexual Garrett is a yes for me 😻🥰
my comfort movie is the dark crystal.
garrett i love you
Garrett! You forgot TOILETPAPER!
i just went on a "hike" a few weeks back and found an entire deer skeleton. completely intact. WARNING IM GONNA GET A LIL GROSS there was still skin on that bad boy on the half that was on the ground still and i absolutely took some of those bones. But after that i immediately got back in the car no thanks.  Comfort movie though has gotta be Warm Bodies (cringe but come on its got zombie romance im a simple man)
My comfort movies are older Barbie movies or any episode of hbo happily ever after I usally watch when I’m sick or clips of anime men I have crush on
Signs! I fuck with that aliens leg in the corn maze
My comfort movie is Bambi and Mickey once upon a Christmas
My comfort movies are the twighlit movies! They suck but theyre awesome and yeah....
my comfort movie is miss congeniality.
Garrett having lit candles in his home gives me the MOST anxiety.😬
my comfort movie is pitch perfect (the first one lol) and guardians of the galaxy i’ve watched both DOZENS of times and they never get old :)
I’m sorry Garrett but I really thought you were wearing a wig
i doubt you’ll ever see this garrett but thank you for this video. this week has been the hardest in a while. it’s my first ever homecoming week and it’s just reminded me how lonely i am. this video put a smile on my face and made me feel a little less alone so thank you <3
50 first dates is an amazing movie tbh
The wedding singer makes my heart happy
I bought the Garrett Watts figurine but I’d much rather this version. Love you Garrett.
I wasn’t having the best day. I’m glad I have you to lean on :)
“are lobsters immortal”
You could say you...🎶booked a haircut but it got rescheduled🎶  I need a Bo Burnham cover song now, Garett!!
I feel as if we are in the same mental state atm.   PS: My comfort movie is Milo and Otis:))
ANY STUDIO GHIBLI MOVIE is my comfort movie!!!!!  When you brought out spirited away I smiled so big!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
my comfort movie is sword in the stone. I love those little squirrels and that nothing stressful really happens.
12 minutes in and where’s Benjamin??
I have a few comfort movies- When I feel sick: Breakfast at Tiffany’s When I am happy: pirates of the Caribbean All of 2021: Inside
Omg i clicked so fast.. oh how I have missed you.. I love the lumberjack look.. ❤🤗👍
imagine him getting pulled over with all this 😭😭
honestly, and i don’t know why, but monte carlo starring selena gomez. i watch it every year several times. same for warm bodies and harry potter. i have always thought it was very odd. 50 first dates is an excellent choice.
my comfort movie has to be coraline. i’ve watched it maybe 28 times. it brings me back to my happiest when i need it.
ratatouille. i’ve watched it more times than i’d like to admit. but that rat keeps calling me back.
Stand By Me is always a movie I go back to. It's also very fitting for this video. It's always so exciting to see a new upload from you! ❤❤
My comfort movie is "Decoy Bride" I love that movie!
my comfort movie is called jack and the cuckoo clock heart! its a surreal movie that (i think?) was made for kids and it was originally french. and its about love and death and every time i watch it i cry but afterwards i feel so complete. the music in it is wonderful and i recommend it! its not for everyone,, but it is for me <3
My comfort movie is Doctor Strange. I don’t know why.
Bo burnham reference 5 seconds into the video: eh I guess  30 minutes later, Garrett at Taco Bell with the headlight: oh my god
Best description of being agnostic
My comfort movie is Monty Python 100%
Not gonna lie, this Garrett variant could obliterate me and I'd say thank you and ask "does next Friday work for you?" 😍
My comfort movie is Garrett watts video of him waking up at 5AM for a week. Multiple, multiple views and I nap to it sometimes. 😴😴😴
My comfort movies/tv are so EXPANSIVE. I, genuinely, could spend 2 hours talking about different titles. Lately I have been watching Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Spaced, Supernatural, Drop Dead Fred, Moulin Rouge, Candyman, & Scream...oddly enough. Lol.  Also: I have been in a really depressive state for quite a while now. Your video made me belly laugh for 32 straight minutes. Thank you for being who you are. It makes my heart happy. Please never stop making art.
Garrett… a bean burrito WITH LETTUCE??? This is the most questionable thing I’ve ever seen come from you.
Garrett sings like Charlie Kelly and I Love it
my comfort movie is monty python and the holy grail. everything about it is so funny and so simple. i love that moving
You look very handsome with the beard and longer hair, you always look great but I think you look particularly hot with the beard❣️ Thanks for what you do. You brought a lot of joy to people today with this video My comfort movie is “Clueless”
Honestly not the best video I've seen of yours BUT still enjoyed it! Thank you for making my day!! 💛💛💛💛
I’ve been thinking of living the modern life for months so I’ll take this as a sign. Thanks Garrett
My comfort movie would probably be moana orrrrrrr i dont usually watch movies but i like stranger things a lot
Oh geez, you doing me a hecking concern Garrett.  I feel bad for him. I hope everything works out for him.
Listen, this may be stupid. My comfort movies are Rocketman and the Sonic movie please, and Megamind
My comfort movie iiiiiis Anastasia 🥰  Ps love u Garrett Ur truly insane 🤣👌
My favorite comfort movies are But I'm a Cheerleader and Cube 💕 Vastly different movies, but both strangely cozy to me!
my comfort movie is IT (2017) because it's the first movie i got OBSESSED with. it means just so much to me.
2 words:  Mercury retrograde  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ok but I definitely want to know the answer to why/how you have a whip
My comfort movies are Love Actually and Hocus Pocus :)
Ya know, I was actually thinking about you last night! It’s good to see you again, friend! I love you very much and let me know if you need a roommate!
My comfort movie would be like Tron legacy i just wannna get zapped into a computer ya know also the sound track is really good (:
ive missed you so much garrett glad to see u and ur skeletons in spooky month
Comfort Movies: Kiki's Delivery Service, Fellowship of the Ring, End of Evangelion
Now I really want to go camping!  My comfort movies are The Wizard of Oz and Love Actually!
My all time comfort films are... Scream 1 and Harry Potter 6: HBP. I could legitimately watch only those two movies for the rest of my life and be really okay~
Or mercury retrograde. Idk when this was filmed
My comfort movie is Real Genius, staring Val Kilmer. It came out in 1985 and not very many people know about it. It's so funny and weird, just like Garrett! It's my fav.
My comfort movies are almost any ghibli movie, and (even though these arent movies these are series, but they count cause they're the length of an actual movie) Over the garden wall, and Bee and Puppycat.
I missed you Garrett! Your videos make me giggle and I love to giggle. My favorite comfort movie is Tom Hank’s directorial debut, That Thing You Do! It is a perfect movie and a perfect soundtrack that brings me pure joy. The title song plays 11 times in the movie but somehow never gets old! Did you know that the titular song was written by Adam Schlesinger from Fountains of Wayne? (Check out his Wiki, he’s written a ton of bangers!!) Anyway… thank you for this video! I’m going on a week long camping trip to celebrate my birthday this weekend, so the timing feels serendipitous. But yeah, I love what you do! Thanks for the laughs.
My comfort movie is for sure Matilda, also I was just coming to rewatch some of your videos and I was so happy to see you posted today!
hocus pocus will forever be my comfort movie, but 50 first dates is SO GOOD
Skill share got Bara or Yaoi tips? Homoerotic illustration workshops? ....🥴
HOW IS HE SINGLE
EDWARD SCISSORHANDS #1 COMFORT MOVIE EVER
coraline is my comfort movie :)
It’s a bear-crow.
one of my comfort movies is inside by bo burnham which is very relevant for this video but anytime literally anything goes wrong it’s time to watch inside again
Is he getting hotter and hotter?
Love! My comfort movie is 100% Harry Potter (any single movie in the franchise, doesn’t matter which I’ve seen them a million times) oooor Wedding Crashers
Garrett is actually the love child of the Lorax with glasses and Inside era Bo Burnham
The blue lagoon and drop dead Fred
HE BOOKED A HAIRCUT BUT IT GOT RESCHEDULED GARRETT'S BEEN A LITTLE DEPRESSED NOOOOOOOO  AND SO TODAY HES GONNA TRY JUST GETTING UP GOING TO THE WOODS ALONE MIGHT NOT HELP BUT STILL IT COULDN'T HURT
Alas. Missed opportunity to call the bear scarecrow  a bearcrow.
So glad to see a new video from you!  My favorite comfort movie is the twilight saga and Harry Potter
omg I miss you so much Garett !! your personality and humor and editing make my day!!!! I always say please upload more but do you and live your best life !
nice new car
This just made me even more attracted to you cuz more fuzzies the better lol...you are absolutely beautiful and I love you unconditionally because you make me laugh my ass off and nature is rad
My comfort movies are the first six Harry Potter movies for sure🧙‍♀️
I just adore you. Thank you for who you are as a person. 🥰
That was really entertaining. Thanks Garret!
I'm sure Andrew was given the elevator pitch for this video and was like, "Hard pass"...
Comfort Movie: Shrek 2
Halloween town, Beetlejuice, hocus pocus, Bartok the magnificent and Mary Poppins are all comfort movies for me
any movie with drew barrymore is an instant comfort movie
my comfort movie would probably be the babysitter. it is just so comedic and has such stereotypical characters that you can't help but laugh at. the editing is superb too.
My all time comfort film is 13 going on 30! Also I highly recommend just going on a hiking trail sometime, much less scary!
….. did you grab your stuff?
my comfort movie is to all the boys I've loved before 3 and the shack lol
I love Hayo Miyazaki. So my comfort movie is (ironically) Spirited Away. I also love Ponyo and Kikis delivery service. Also i know its not a movie but my favorite comfort series are Boy meets World and Glee. Love u Garrett.💙 Glad u didn't die in the woods and get buried next to your bathroom window spidey friend.🕷
:"
Mamma mia !
“I sent them to a detective friend”     Garrett’s ______ friend should be a show
My comfort movie is Galaxy Quest, but Clue might be a close second
This guy is sooo weird, wtf.. Lmao, jk, we love u Garrett! :D
We get a video?? It MUST be a bones day
It's the retrograde, my friend
when the world needed him the most he came back
My comfort movies are Mulan, little mermaid, and nightmare before Christmas
WE MISSED YOU! I can’t wait for the new episodes for sweet boys!
I knew Garret was going to get home because this video is edited and uploaded but also the whole time I felt a legit thrill of concern that he was actually going to end up dead in the woods for some reason
My absolute favorite comfort movie is Coraline. So so so good. And spooky. Also I would love to be your friend, you such are a sweet soul 🖤
My favorite movie is Phantom of the Opera!!
The skeleton in the pool I cannot 😭💀
Don't have a comfort movie, but The Moomins (1990) is my serotonin show. Cottagecore aesthetic, found family, and strange fantasy lore. What else do you need?
Glad that we know that since he uploaded that he is alive. <3 you, Garrett.
Garrett: “I’m over prepared”   *looks at pile of fake skeletons, electronic’s and a bear costume*   Me: he’s going to die
Honestly I'd love to see you try camping in the Willamette National Forest, OR. Scary as f out there.
I HAVE MISSED HIM SO MUCH 😩😩😩😩😩😩
we have Brian Laundrie running loose, presumably along trails and in the woods, and Garrett's like....let's go!
My favorite comfort movie is The Labyrinth! I just got the 35th anniversary blu-ray and then realized I'm old. 🤣  If you like spiders, my husband has around 3,000 tarantulas in our garage (in containers, not free range LOL).
My comfort movies are Willow and The Mummy!  Just mentioning them makes me want to throw them on...  Looks like no sleep tonight, it's double-feature time!
Who else gets so excited when Garrett uploads
I was just watching your previous video, the one before this! So happy to see you again :D Hope you and Andrew do some spooky videos for October!
bet someone stealing catalytic converters to build an underground squid games
Comfort movie: It takes two (1995) :)  Also the burial for the spider in the tiny coffin, was the weirdest, sweetest thing ever lol.
Garrett is a degree of unhinged in this video that ive not experienced in quite some time. I respect and fear him
the way i love pitch perfect
garret bring flagging tapeeeee
My comfort movies are “oh brother where art thou” and “riding giants”
im still sad u didn't call it a bearcrow instead of scarecrow
Garrett we’ve missed you so much ! And the podcast too ! Please come back
Clue will always be my #1 comfort movie. Such a classic and it makes me laugh every time! Bedknobs and Broomsticks is my second go-to 🧡
👁💋👁
See, my comfort show is Merlin (the BBC show) and my movie kinda changes every so often,, rn it's knives out i literally can't stop watching it for some reason
Talks shit about her kids while cutting your hair? Is your hairdresser Donna Kline Ethans mum lol 🤷🏻‍♀️

Comfort movie is definitely big hero 6. Yes I like crying, it gives me comfort 😂
Garret I love your 2D figure :D
OMG when you said Coco I died bc that’s what I wanted to put🤣 I’ve watched it sooo many times it’s probably embarrassing😂❤️
Omg that’s a whole trend about the converter! It’s happening in my city too
He’s back…..😂

Missed you Garrett! I have lots of comfort movies but Heathers, Tangled, Labyrinth, Howl's Moving Castle, and the pro-shot of the Newsies Broadway show are some of my main ones!
You know it's a good sponsor 💰 when Garrett actually uploads 😩
Comfort movies: Hocus Pocus and Juno 🤷🏻‍♀️
He induces me to take a Valium.
YESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!

honestly garret, you don’t need to decorate your house for halloween. it’s already perfect
Garrett .. you make me cry laughing… no one else has that power
you named the jeep yet? i think he's Jim but maybe that's just me  if he argues then he's Jack. i don't make the rules
This is my comfort
can’t wait for more Sweet Boys !!! 💖
My comfort movie is definitely Matilda or Master of Disguise. Missed you Garrett<3
honestly if you do hear gunshots in the woods, there is probably a ranger camp nearby which would indicate why they dont want you to trespass idk
Dam Garret those are some big muscles
I have a bunch of comfort movies. The first few that come to mind are Mrs Doubtfire, save the last dance, mean girls, and just about any Disney movie.
Hold on...What if Benjamin is actually haunting Garrett??! 👀
My comfort movie would be Ratatouille or Spider-Man 2002
My comfort movie is Zootopia
Omg Garrett we have the same comfort movie!! 50 first dates has no reason to be so good!😭
Thank you for the free month!!! love you tons! 😘😘😘
I was just checking your channel a day ago wondering when you'd upload again, and then there was this notification. Hes one of the only people that still keep my interest through the whole video 😭
I think my comfort movie changes once a year, haha. And i can't pick ONE, are you insane? I would have to go with Howl's Moving Castle, Deadpool, and Venom.
My comfort movie is The Dark Knight B)
You’re ORGANISED PIN BOARD BEHIND YOU BABY YES ORGANISATION YOUR KILLING IT QUEEN ❤️
A few things: 1. This video is great. As usual. 2. RIP kitchen window spider.  3. Bearded Garrett in his Brawny shirt is perfection 😍 And 4. my comfort movies are DaVinci Code and Practical Magic.

Moana!
My comfort movies consist of: The Holiday, any Harry Potter film like you said, specifically Prisoner of Azkaban, John Hughes films and Easy A.   Welcome back, king. Always a huge sigh of relief when I see you’ve uploaded a video. Thank you for always being so unapologetically yourself. 💕 Miss your content but it’s so worth the wait for the effort you put into it!
buzzfeed unsolved AND garrett posted THIS IS MY DAY!!!!!
Garrett thank you so much! I really needed this laugh! Stuck in a prone position for another 4 weeks, stupid foot surgery! Just think if you brought home any bugs it's just another friend your little bathroom spider sent home with you so you aren't lonely 🤣 comfort movie...The Dark Crystal, Princess Bride, Wayne's World and many more!
Garret Watts posting ON MY BIRTHDAY??? OMG BEST PRESENT EVER! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MEEE 💕
My comfort movie would be a christmas carol, the muppets. I don't know why, but it always has been. Oh, and, if you really read your comments, that's very nice of you to read the feedback. I relate so much to you, I also have a mini world in my home and people find it weird, but it absolutely love it!

HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE!!!!!!!
Garret brought a sword, whip and a fake skeleton, how did he not get arrested for suspiciously looking like he's going to attempt murder.
I reccommend doing what the Try Guys did where they went to a spot where there was water, they had a survival kit to use, and you can find your way back home.
as someone who regularly goes camping this video sure was entertaining  edit: I can’t say I rlly have a comfort movie but star trek ds9 is my comfort series hehe

Missed you Garrett! So many good comfort movies to choose from, but I adore The Labyrinth, it's always been close to my heart.
Shane those diet Dr Peppers taste good but the chemicals are worse than sugar.  Xoxo
Yayyyy!!!! My favorite youtuber posted😁
I was hoping that you'd drop something soon! I have missed you!
Is this a spoof of Shane? I actually can’t tell 😂

People stealing catalytic converters is happening here in Az too!! Mine was stolen off of my old car! Smh

My comfort movie: The Hobbit 1977 animated
I just caught up on videos yesterday and was wondering when you would post again 😄😄
My favourite comfort movies are the parent trap (Lindsay Logan obviously) Halloweentown 1 and toy story 🎃  Please be safe Garrett 😘
My comfort movies are coraline and the nightmare before Christmas because I would always watch them when I was younger and it reminds me of the simple times ❤️
Hello, you tall, sweet, praying mantis. My comfort movies are usually, Shaun of the Dead, or Role Models. I think almost any movie with Paul Rudd is a comfort movie for me. Please be safe out there, or in there, or you know, just there. xoxo
The Spider burial for some reason gave me major Over the Garden Wall vibes
My comfort movie is for sure My Neighbor Totoro. I love it so much, my first tattoo was a totoro tattoo of the chibi totoros. I of course plan to one day complete my totoro tattoo collection with the big boy totoro himself on my arm right by the others
I’ve been having a rough time but this makes me feel a lot better.
RIP little spider buddy🕷🕸💗  You are the sweetest person in the world, Garrett😊
Damn, why was I born a straight woman? The "Mountain Man" look is my weakness.
i think my comfort movie/movies might be ferris bulers day off or any marvel movie :))
This is premium content 🧑‍🍳🤌🏻
ahh a new garrett video !!! good way to end the week. my comfort movies are IT 2017 and doukyuusei (classmates) ! i’ve seen them both so many times i could quote them word for word. i also have a soft spot for both goblet of fire and half blood prince
Comfort Movies: All HP and Wizard of Oz
Garrett! You look very handsome! Stop putting yourself down lol
I dont have a comfort movie but i have a bear that I've had since i was a couple months old (for context im now 20 :( ) that brings me great comfort and can always rely on if i need a good cry
my comfort movie would prolly be either coco or the duff
My fav comfort movie is Avatar <3
Well, that was kinda fun. Guess we'll see you in another 3 months or so.. o7
Comfort movie is coraline 🤣
I would love nothing more than to run away with a lovely funny human being like you. Laughs, friendship & snacks for days! This was one of your funniest videos Garrett. Thank you for uploading and being fun! 🖤
Comfort Movie: Lady and the Tramp II: Scamps Adventure Confort Series: Degrassi: The Next Generation  Please invite Andrew next time so you don't get murdered alone in the woods 😬 Glad you got home safe and love your videos 💚
I think what you should have done was buy a survival kit
love when Garrett comes back from the dead :) (ily and ty for uploading)
My comfort movie is parent trap ❤️
Garrett, have you like never seen a horror movie or HECK listened to a ghost story 😂 (also side note: Spider-Man 2 is my comfort movie)
my comfort movie is probably dickie roberts former child star for real, it's so goofy but under all the slapstick that makes me laugh it tells such a touching story about found family, aka one of the better tropes out there, and all the real shit child actors go through emotionally. plus, actual former child stars singing in the credits is one of my favorite scenes in a movie, the song slaps!!
My comfort movie is 13 Going on 30!!
"it's a BAT" sent me. Idk why
garrett joins the ritual and is stalked by the bastard child of loki
actually the beard suits you, Garrett
me trying to see normal video before i see your video
Barbie and the twelve dancing princesses is my comfort movie. When they spin their hair doesn’t move and I find it very funny
my comfort movies are ratatouille and coraline :)
Ok Garrett. I'll ask the question. Why the whip?
Am I the only one who likes his look? Why does it work and is kinda hot?
*“Be honest who else is a few hours late”😂*
I'm still gonna run off into the woods one day. No one can stop me lmfao.
Garret buying a tiny coffin for a spider he saw every morning is the sweetest thing I’ve heard yet ✨
I live in maine...this is normal for me
My comfort movie is Howl’s moving castle especially lately 💜🖤
My comfort movie has got to be Kung Fu Panda. It’s just the right mix of everything to make my brain happy :D
you won't believe how happy i get whenever i see you upload another video
Loved the super chaotic video!😂 My husband and I watched it together as we ate dinner. We were very scared for your life and we were super glad you didn’t get eaten by a bear, arrested, etc😀  As for my comfort movies, I have quite a few (as I tend to watch the same movies and shows over and over because watching something new gives me super high anxiety even if it’s just like a sweet movie about a dog or something- like I’m just on edge the whole time not know what is going to happen next😅) So here’s my top 5, which I can’t even fathom the number of times I’ve actually watched each of them: -Scooby-Doo and the witches ghost (I WILL NEVER STOP WATCHING SCOOBY-DOO) -Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (The spookiest hp movie and, in my opinion, best by far) -(500) Days of Summer (Most of it is so sad but idk I kind of like sad things and I just love it) -Sweeney Todd (IT IS AMAZING. COULD WATCH RIGHT NOW. I MEAN, JOHNNY AND HELENA, THE MUSIC- COME ON!!!) -Girl, interrupted (SUCH a sad movie, but it goes right to my heart every time. I love it so much😫)
OMG I GOT A GARRETT UPLOAD TODAY??
My fav comfort movie is Tangled
I’ve been waiting sooooo long for his return 🤗
When the tree fell I jump so hard
i like watching your videos because they make me feel normal
I'll just die and see what happens lol. I did in fact lol right now.
My comfort movie is 27 dresses or scream Because it reminds me of when I was young and everything seemed fine. I lived upstairs in my moms house and I would always forget to bring up a new movie so I’d have scream in the vcr or 27 dresses in my DVD player.
Id definitely recommend oregon or washington forests they give off the best forest vibe
Ugh Garrett can I leave to live in the woods with you too? You could move to Australia and we will have a bush home... and I'll grow food... and just escape
I'm agnostic also.
Love these videos Garrett! Keep up the amazing work❤❤
Garrett, you have no idea how much your videos being me joy. Thank you! I hope you have a great month🧡🧡 Oh, I almost forgot...my comfort movie is Boss Baby💀💀

Ganna start a podcast soon anybody wanna join?🙂
My Comfort movie will forever and always be Matilda <3
does anyone else do this? everytime garrett says "garrett shut up quit talking" i just think "no please keep talking, your voice is very comforting and i love it when you rant about random stuff. it makes me very happy for some reason"  no? just me? alrighty then
Garrett, just come to Alabama. Our whole state is woods.
I’ve spent days rewatching all your old stuff thinking to myself, God I wish he uploads soon, before telling myself “Garrett is out doing Garrett and living his good ole Garrett life. When he had something to upload and WANTS to upload, he’ll grace us with his wholesome content once again”. Thank you Garrett! ❤️
Live , laugh, Love, ratatouille

You lovely human 🥺  And my comfort movies are Up, The Incredibles (the first one), and Coralline They remind me of childhood
Garret I loved this as I love all your wonderful stuff, but please be careful!
Every Garrett video is: crazy fun idea, no preparation or real supplies of any kind, chaotically trying not to get derailed, regretting all of that and then doing it for the next one lmao. No hate tho I love you Garrett I just think it’s a funny pattern lol
It genuinely makes my day better when I see Garrett uploaded🥲 also my favorite comfort movie is beauty and the beast!
Comfort films, phantom of the opera, the labrinth, James and the giant peach, Edward scissor hands, Harry potter(all but especially prisoner of azkaban), most studio ghibli films 🎥
Also I had a horror movie idea about concept about a man going off and living in the woods to get away from society but then ends up killing a bunch of Rowdy teenagers that threatened his peace. But I never make the time so Shane if you read that make it into a horror story I give you permission because it sounds like a really good movie but what experience or time do I have to make that happen

This is either the most ADHD person I've ever seen, or someone on meth.

Imagine being an intruder into someone’s home and seeing a skeleton in their pool, but ur not phased. Ur gonna break in anyway. But then the homeowner pulls out a butter knife from their pack of cookies. U decide, u know what, I’m not trying to die today, not worth it.

Thank you for the content Garrett! Have you watched Squid Games and if so what’s your thoughts on it?

The fact that his hogwarts tower broke and the tower in tarot means huge drastic life change..

Comfort movie: tangled, perks of being a wallflower  Comfort tv episode for when I have anxiety: supernatural season 4 episode 1 ’Lazarus Rising’. It’s when you meet Castile for the first time.

You know it’s a bones day when garret posts
Shawshank Redemption or O Brother where art thou?
ANSWER : This was honestly a bit of a difficult question cause I don't watch many movies, and when I need comfort I don't tend to gravitate to a particular one cause I usually just watch Youtube videos that make me really happy (yours for example) but if I had to pick one... I would say The Nightmare Before Christmas! I love stop motion animation, and I still listen to all the songs on repeat. It is one of my favorite movies and I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it!

i love and recognise this video as like. whoa . real. real? real! screams and runs down the street in a sheet smiling harder than people who imagine eating squirrels. I"m fine. We're all fine.

Spirit stallion of the Cimarron!!! You made me realize that I have more comfort shows than movies tho  And the beard is a look <3
This is the most stressful thing I’ve watched recently. Why did you not at least get a burner phone so you’d have a gps or a way to call someone in an emergency ? The adventure is great, seriously though you need more water dude.
I've been super stressed lately but the stressfulness and humor of this video calmed me down a bit. So thank you for making me laugh and forget about my life for a little bit.
My comfort movie is Zombieland...even my daughters can recite it word for word.
My comfort movies are: Pride and Prejudice (2008) or Princess Mononoke...I was so happy when I saw you brought Spirited Away 😭
Why not go nomading in your car now that you have one that works. It’s safer than the woods. I don’t really like movies but a comfort SOUNDTRACK that is very recent for me is the centaurworld soundtrack. It helps me sleep~
Tangled and Knives Out are two of my comfort movies. Daniel Craig's ~southern drawl~ is so calming
Comfort movies include; Superbad, Men in Black, Christmas with the Kranks. & comfort shows include; That’s 70s show, How I Met Your Mother, Law & Order SVU & Burn Notice
Brazil by Terry Gilliam is the absolute best comfort movie in my personal opinion, absolutely splendiferous.
Your piano sesh really reminded me of Charlie from It's Always Sunny, and i LOVED IT
My comfort movies are Ella Enchanted and Howl’s Moving Castle. I could watch them forever
My comfort movie has to be The Holiday. I love Kate Winslet 🤭 and also, Jude Law is a S N A C K in that movie!
My comfort movie is The Nightmare Before X-mas, used to watch it with my grandma all the time.
Omg there you are! Idk I have a few comfort movies but the Feival Mouskewitz movies are up there!! I grew up with them...and Adventure Time is my comfort show by landslide!!
this entire video is a cry for help
I love the over the hedge reference
I love the huge amount of randomness in this video. It's everything! Btw, My comfy movies are a franchise as well, any Marvel studios movie will do. I don't know why, by they feel so comfy to me.
On September 27th Mercury went into retrograde for the third and final time in 2021. During this period of Mercury retrograde, which ends on Oct. 18, you'll probably hear a number of people carrying on about how everything is going wrong — and it's all because of Mercury retrograde. If you don't know about it, you should do a little research ...its pretty interesting. I swear every single time shit is going nuts I am like its gotta be retrograde and it alllllways is
Babe that lumberjack look on you makes me forget that you're gay. 👉👈
Garrett looks like zeke from aot
Well that was stressful.   My comfort movie is an anime called Classmates. It's about two high school boys navigating their way through a relationship and it's very sweet. I love the animation style and music. Overall it's very soothing and one of my favorite movies. It's a good watch if you want a short but sweet queer romance anime movie (a little specific but I find myself feeling this way a lot lol).
Fridge breaks:   Normal reaction: eat/cook the food or throw it out Garrett reaction: run away to the woods! LOL omg! LMAO
Garrett camping with a toddler tent ⛺️ 😂😂😂
my comfort films are meet Joe black and twighlight breaking dawn 1 and 2
Easy A is a good movie😭 she's so badass😂😂
I’m not sure why i am attracted to this strange human but i am… he’s pretty hot .. and mildly amusing 🤷🏻‍♀️  Also, I don’t have a comfort movie but i have a comfort show or two - The Office & Gilmore Girls 💜
Comfort movie, either Lilo and stitch, emperors new groove or pitch perfect 🥰 you’re doing great sweetie ❤️❤️
Comfort movie: Pitch Perfect!
Priuses specifically are a top victim of catalytic converter theft because the economic Prius doesn't put much wear on the "cat", therefore criminals can get a nice lightly used cat to sell for cash
Comfort movie....all Lord of the Rings!

Garrett really is living his dream, idk if it's a sane/safe dream, but he's definitely livin it
Garrett you're amazing! Honestly this is my dream! No shame in the Teddy bear either, I sleep with mine, longest relationship ever 29years and counting! The Jeep looks AWESOME!
25:01 is that Winnie the Pooh?
Typing this at the beginning**** but I never thought Garrett belonged in the city. He needed a quieter and less chaotic place. A place without pressure and to be himself Update!! He has a dinosaur play tent.. i.may have thought more about this than he
my favorite comfort movie is Rango lol don`t judge love you who ever is reading this
Man going on a road trip with you looks like it would be fun!

Erykah Badu!! Garrett my cultured boy! also The Wiz and Princess and The Frog are my comfort movies :)
My comfort movies : nightmare before christmas and labyrinth...i love bowie in that movie
My “comfort movies” are the Hobbit trilogy/ Lord of the rings trilogy/Back to the future trilogy
If we pretend that the eight Harry Potter movies don't exist... then my comfort movies are the two Sherlock Holmes movies with Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law
My comfort movie I would have to say is “Oliver and The Company”. I only say it’s my comfort movie because my family wasn’t in a good place at the time.. I member my mom showing me that movie and I still love watching it.
Kiki's delivery service is my comfort movie. It was also my introduction movie to the anime world. I'm glad to see you are alive and making great content as usual. Take care if yourself and I'm look forward to your next video.
I will be waiting patiently for a collab with you and Caitlin Doughty
ok but try frozen grapes. its ✨chefs kiss✨

I was hoping you would post ahhhhh pls post moreeee
"Are lobsters Immortal" Yes.
I love that every time you've posted recently I'm on a 24hr ICU shift :)
Not a movie but my go to tv show is Supernatural. I have watched all 15 seasons multiple times.
😵 Garrett ticks are a thing. No sandals In the wilderness like that. 😭 You need to invest in some hiking boots at least to cover at least over your ankles.
Benjamin!
I,m with ya!!!!
Awww, poor little bathroom spider buddy! I love that he got a proper burial lol
Howl's Moving Castle is def my comfort movie (and yes all the Harry Potters, love the Hermione wand I have one too) but all the Ghibli movies I think tend to have that effect on me and I suspect other people (I just watched Whisper of the Heart yesterday and it felt like a hug from a creative mentor I never had) Also I'm glad the mean lady didn't show up in this video; you don't deserve to have anyone talk about you in that way even if it's a representation of your subconscious critical self <3
I love this video so much. Fav comfort movie is scooby doo on zombie island or scooby doo and the alien invaders
My ULTIMATE comfort movie is Labyrinth, the one with David Bowie. It’s because the soundtrack is so immersive and mystical, the Jim Henson puppet designs are so cool, and just the musical parts of it like Dance Magic Dance are a BOP. I love the outfits, and I love David Bowie’s sass as the villain.  I’m always quoting the movie too lol
My comfort movies are the Harry potter movies and the Twilight movies
Tigger adventure in 100 acre woods vibes
My comfort movie is either Studio Ghibli's The Secret World of Arietty and The Proposal with Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock c:  I also have a spider in the windowsill of my shower, he keeps an eye out for creepers and has a friend or two on the other side of the sill. I'm gonna be devastated if/when he passes away
Poor Garett watched too much tv lol
yyyyaaaaayyyyyy
My comfort movie is Alice in Wonderland (1951), Trolls World Tour, anddddd The Lego Movie😎 Love you too!!💕
My comfort movie is literally any studio ghibli movie lol but my favorites are spirited away and howls moving castle:)
I have been rewatching your old videos the past few days. This is exciting!
Honestly, Coraline. I could and will watch it to the credits over and over again until the police show up to do a welfare check and I'm in the same position and my house has been broken into and robbed and my wifi router has been stolen but I have the DVD that you flip over and it becomes a 3D movie and came with glasses so I'm all good.
I absolutely needed this ! Yasssssssss !!!
How did he fit that butter knife in the cookie container 🤨
Bearcrow
Garrett has a remarkable ability to make scary and depressing real world things cute and fun. Such an underrated superpower
Garret: the next time you see me I will be more together and more human.  Me: ew why?
Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and also The Proposal are my comfort movies
I love spirited away!!!😭😭❤️
My comfort movie is the Labyrinth, it's the best🖤
I'm glad you brought some Lamas bread XD hahaha
My comfort movie is inside :))
My comfort movie, well series is Stranger Things lol, I start from the beginning and when I’m done I start it over again. It just makes me feel normal, Idk why. 😄🤦🏻‍♀️
Garrett actually fitting his giant man body into a child’s play tent lol
My favorite comfort movie is The Last Unicorn!! I still cry every time I watch it! By the way….I LOVE when you post! You can literally post just babbling nonsense and I’d be happy!!
Ok I know this is my 4th comment but lay off, mmmk? I just reached the end and wanted to answer the question!!    So my comfort movie is either Ponyo, because it’s a complete and utter V I B E with the underwater town and the independent lil children and their safe little community 💕 💕   Or the first DeadPool movie because the girl Wade helps in the beginning is called Megan and that’s MY name and sometimes I pretend if I was ever scared that Wade Wilson would come beat the shit out of some creep to save me and make me feel safe again.
When should we be worried about Garrett
ur very brave pal i 1000% would have died in that lil tent.  my comfort movie is ponyo! or practical magic :-)
100% '5 Children And It' is my comfort movie, it'S essentially The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe without the lion, witch or a wardrobe BUT it does have a magical sand fairy who gets these 5 (wartime) kids in a whole bunch of shenanigans, like granting them wishes like becoming rich, eating ice cream, driving cars and even get to see their dad who was away fighting in the war, all while learning valuable lessons along the way. yay! it's very sweet, from my childhood and honestly just so silly, so it has always helped me unwind and always comfort my inner child. id think you and many others would love this movie too! the sand fairy is a little fish, shrimp man crab too!! WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT!!!
Pleeeeease upload more often!! Watched all the adverts to help get your stuff replaced. Much love ❤
I also have alot but if I'm saying one it's the Naked Brother's Band Movie.
My comfort movie is meet me in st. Louie.
I live in the woods…with bears. Mostly, they are shy and want to carry on with their bear business… Black Bears are pretty mellow. Cheers!
Garrett my dude, I would totally go off the grid with you. You just need a little "Tiny" House homestead where you can collect and exist and just live your best life.
ironically, my comfort movie is the blair witch project ... and on an uh, unrelated note, glad to see you home safe !!!
One of my comfort movies is the Diary of a Wimpy kid series. I think it just embodies the movies that played when I was younger and they always make me feel a sort of comfort nostalgia.
My comfort movie is Galaxy Quest!!
GARRETT 💗💗💗💗
Adulting stinks.
Is … is this the same shirt as … as the last upload…? Has anyone seen him in real life…
My comfort movie definitely has to be spirited away, the visuals and soundtrack are so relaxing.
Just started watching it and I am incredibly excited. I’ve missed you Garret :,)
.....Bearcrow ***
my comfort movie is it ch2 bc i have terrible taste. yes i was a film major what do you mean
i loved this also you don't look bad you're scruffy
Hey dude, I hope your feeling better after this mental breakdown 😅
garretttt you had me on the EDGE of my seat dude :0 next time you spook out in the woods, bring a pal who isnt a pile of 8 foot bones hahaha but to answer your question, my comfort movie(s) are kill bill 1 & 2... you were giving me very much kill bill energy when you found that abandoned trailer home!
I saw Garrett next to a bear so I clicked it
He's such a sweetheart.So excited to see where u go from here ❤️
Okay but are lobsters immortal? I need to know!
Honestly my comfort movie definitely has to be all of the MCU and Megamind lol
My comfort movies are pitch perfect, the twilight moves and Annie from 1982 I don’t know why but they bring me peace and comfort
comfort movies: *ALL* the harry potter movies pride and prejudice  little women  twilight 1st one or the breaking dawns or any marvel movie :)) plus sm more but my mind is occupied
My comfort movies are The Princess and the Frog, and Monsters University. I’m from Savannah, GA which has the same feel as Louisiana so Princess is very nostalgic and homie to me. Monster University is just my way of escaping the constant anxiety I have about college. Especially because I’m doing online college in a long distance relationship, that shit gets lonely.
Love anytime I see a video from you in my notifications!  My comfort movies have to be Toy story (1 & 2 mostly), Monsters inc, lilo and stitch, and Big daddy
RIP Bathroom window Spider 🕷 👼👻💀👽 My favorite comfort movie is Groundhog's Day. 🐻
Honestly any movie that I've seen in the past is a comfort movie because it's something I know and am familiar with whether that be a family movie or a rom com doesn't matter
Comfort movies: Obvi HP. Also, Van Helsing, Moulin rouge, Earth Girls Are Easy, aristocats, so many more
I don’t know if you will see this but will there be another season of sweet boys?
The sandals in the woods is only one of the things I’m laughing my face off about lol 😂
Garrett, I am 100% convinced you are soulmates with my brother. My lifelong goal is going to be getting you two to meet! Lol love seeing you again!!
Noodle really called it with a bones day
I have a very bad habit of rewatching movies over and over and over again. My comfort movie switches depending on what mood I'm in. Most recently my comfort movie has been The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo with Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, but before it was Just Go With It with Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston. I love movies so much, and my comfort movie always changes thru all different genres. Love your video Garrett!
0:50 in and all I can think “ohh damn this is relatable” 😂😂😂
Omg Garret I love you some much lm Literally dead in the first 5 minutes. I can’t stop laughing you made my day thank you so much. LMAO
Spiderwick Chronicles ☺️
My comfort movies are the quiet man and the cowboys really anything with John Wayne ❤️❤️❤️
I've missed your vlogs. I love to watch your content!❤
You remind me of a golden retriever
my comfort movie is Kiki’s delivery service, I still have the vhs copy even tho I don’t have a vhs player anymore lolol
Garrett I think the you that you put on this youtube channel is great
Some of my comfort movies that come to mind are Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, the 2002 live action Scooby-Doo movie, a Nickelodeon movie called Spectacular! (which is so underrated btw) and the 2004 Spongebob movie. ❤️
U look like a very nice lumberjack :)
'Are lobsters immortal'  First. Yes. Second. This is exactly the kinds of things I always imagined Garrett would Google
Where is Andrew
Move to spokane!
Also the tent is comically small for you
My comfort movie is probably Big Fish by Tim Burton, if you haven't watched it I strongly recommend <3 so wholesome and unique and just wonderful. (also LOTR gets an honorable mention)
So glad to see you back Garrett.
Comfort movie Step Brothers For sure. It was very bad of you to go into the woods alone. Shame 😋
I love Walmart bo burnham
my comfort movie is definitely Matlida, i've been watching that movie for as long as I can remember and still get the jitters of excitement.
Garret I love you. I hope you know you are literally the best person. And the beard doesn’t look bad at all.
My mum walked in and asked if you were wearing a wig 🤣 i then got to share with her your elaborate story of why you haven't cut it 🤣🤣🤣
oh my GOD !! my comfort movies are pirates of the Caribbean 2, leap year, and inception, idk why and I can't explain - but these are so comforting to me <33
My comfort movie is 100% White House Down I could watch that movie every day for the rest of my life and be content lol
All I want to do is flee into the woods and live my life as a bog witch. But no, my partner is a functional adult with a job in a city 😕
Are we ever going to get sweet boys season two? 🥲 I miss seeing you and Andrew every week
The comment about "the whip" made me breathe heavy... 😊😏
I love you and your questionable decisions ❤️  My comfort movie is Little Forest! It's a Korean movie about a young woman and he connection to her mom through food. It's so much more than that, but you have to watch it to understand. WARNING: Do NOT watch without snacks/dinner! All the food looks so good, it'll make you wanna eat SOMETHING!
Almost Famous is my comfort movie! I can quote pretty much the whole thing.
I need a Garrett in my life, you're my kind of person 🤣
Nada que una limpia no pueda solucionar
i love you ❤️
Garrett you’re looking fire we stan the hair and beard 🔥
I was thinking about you a couple days ago and rewatched your last video...I was like “he HAS to post soon”...and here u are 🤗
i think my comfort movie is like thor ragnarok or nightmare before christmas
We have been blessed
Drop Dead Fred and The Wedding Singer!
sorry, i took a break from watching you to rewatch THAT scene from 8 Mile, thanks for the reminder
My comfort movie is definitely Twister - all day every day😋
I just got home and saw that you uploaded when I tell you I have never ran that fast to get snacks and get up to my room I mean it. Also great job with the video it was awesome 10 out of 10 will watch again
The end chat at home was so heartfelt and hit on many things we are all feeling. I see you, seeing everyone else.😇 Aside from ALL of the fantasy movies Meet Joe Black (Still fantasy =p) is a movie that helps me to reset. It's a lil morbid I know and not very popular. It is a movie of Love and death and what I call The More which is everything behind the vale of the mundane world we live in. A quiet rainy few hours to reset and think of what matters. Be good to you and those you meet along the way Garrett. Cya 👋
I love that gorillaz statue
Comfort movies of mine are Twilight LOL, The Labyrinth and Luca!! Ooh and Spirited Away of course, I’ve got the soot sprites tattooed on my arm!
This fully reminds me of the first time I decided to go camping. I brought 3 friends, that same boy scouts handbook, and every blanket I owned. Oh and LSD. We had a somewhat similar experience but we lasted till dawn 🤣 then saw lots of moose and a fatal car accident 💀👻
Team Garrett
Hocus Pocus, The Addams Family 1&2, Kill Bill, and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Also maybe Charlie’s Angels
Garrett I love you, I wish we were friends. 🥺💕
The first one that came to mind when you asked your question was Beetlejuice.
The only creator that gets me to verbally scream when they upload. 💕 Love you Garrett!!

My comfort movies are clockwork orange or Kiki's delivery service. Or grey's anatomy season 1 😊 or Harry Potter of course haha
My comfort movie is How the Grinch Stole Christmas 😝 also, I've never seen one of your videos and your entire everything is how my brain is all the time 🤣
My comfort movie(s)…. “This is the End”, any of the Harry Potter movies-but the books are WAY better and maybe twilight series. The moody dark background music is great to help soothe you to sleep! Lol. Love you Garrett and It makes me so happy anytime you upload a video no matter what it is!💞
i'm begging you where did you get your skeletons I'm in desperate need
oh my god for the comfort movie i gotta say hoodwinked idk why that movie hits me different when i need it :')

I saw someone has been steeling cat converters. It’s because there is non available due to Covid shortages in parts and cars.

My favorite comfort movies are Flipped (2010), Beetlejuice, and Fried Green Tomatoes
HOT FUZZ is my comfort movie idk why I love it so much but I do.

"I'll just die and see what happens LOL😜"
When his beard connect: 😏
My comfort movie would be definitely Sherk 2
So this is what happens when Andrew leaves town…jk I loved how accurately your energy in this vid conveys how pent up about life I’ve been feeling lately Thx for the good content as always ❤️

Umm fav comfort movie is probably howls moving castle, Star Wars #2 Attack of the Clones, or Harry Potter #3 or 5 (and probably more that aren’t coming to mind rn)

I literally JUST checked your channel today bc I was like “damn I haven’t seen Garrett in a long ass time I hope he’s ok” YAAY
Ok new car...im happy for you ☺☺☺
Why do I feel like garrett is literally shaggy from scooby doo... 🤷‍♀️
My comfort movies are Spider-Man: Homecoming and The Emperor's New Groove (which are 2 VERY different movies, but they're both very comforting to me).

1:36 same garret. Same.
i don't have a comfort movie (i used to, it was 'The Nanny Diaries' with Scarlett Johanson and Chris Evans, i think i watched it at least 5 times in my last semester of University) but I *do* have 2 comfort TV shows - BBC Merlin (which i think you would love) and Glee
My comfort movie is all dogs go to heaven!! Or one of my comfort movies I have many- It's a very good movie and so nostalgic for me, it also makes me appreciate my dogs so much <3

not a comfort movie but show--shera and the princesses of power (the netflix one obvi)
My comfort movie is Batman Begins, but specifically all the Scarecrow scenes.  It makes more sense in my head.
I think I’d be more terrified to come across a grown man giggling in his dinosaur tent in the middle of the night 🤣🤣
LOTR are my comfort movies
I have multiple comfort movies, but my top 2 are Fantastic Mr.Fox and Pride and Prejudice!
My comfort movie is August Rush :)

my comfort "movie" is the short cartoon network series Over the Garden Wall. it's about two siblings who got lost in the woods, and the adventures they get into (v much like u in this vid). it's wholesome, it's spooky, it's magical. if you haven't yet seen it, garrett... i just really think you would love it so much :D
Miss you
my comfort movies are ponyo, the spongebob movie, and disney’s bolt lol
Go back to Washington state. Where you visited Saint Ignatius. Perhaps you could visit Forks. Where the Cullen vampire clan has taken up residence. There is definitely a vast wilderness. Who knows, you may actually come across a Bigfoot. Vampires, Bigfoot, acres and acres of uncharted forest and woodland. What could be better? Also. I'm only 7 minutes into the video. So I have no idea where Garrett will choose to go. That was just my input/suggestion. I'm curious as to where he decides to go.  Now...on with the rest of the video. 😊🤟
Everyone is getting the heck out of L.A! I’m so happy for you!
My Comfort moves are Bolt, Tangled, and Home. All animations, and full of nostalgia for me.
im not joking and not for the meme's  all the kung fu panda movies or shark tail are my comfort movies
My comfort movie is midsommar. I sometimes just put it on for background noise and I can visualize what's happening by listening 🙃
my comfort movie is Night at the Museum 2!
If I learned something is, no, please don't shave the beard, you look really good
Very much living my Over the Garden Wall fantasy
I feel you should actually live in a converted barn 😅 rustic yet coooool
Garrett has a somewhat upload schedule like every other month
All Harry Potter movies, Jennifer's body, twilight
You should watch Alone on netflix a bunch of survivalists compete for a million dollars if they can survive in the wild alone for 100 days pretty legit and spooky. Legit binging the show

It’s silly and reminds me of hanging out with my friends as we used to ALWAYS watch it as teens and still watch it together as adults! Thanks for uploading!
When Shane and Garrett went out on a blind date, who knew it was Garrett who was the one who was genuinely sweet and wildly talented.

I know it's no surprise but mine would probably be like Hotel Transylvania, The Addams Family Values, Beetlejuice or maybe Hot Rod. They're all so good, can't pick just one!
I cried laughing so hard at the butter knife "gotcha bitch".
Wholesome peep!!! I love You so much Garrett.
My comfort movie is howls moving castle, spirited away, and Mulan the only film that could stop be crying at night when I was a kid lol :))
This silly man is absolutely gorgeous
I love the tiny coffin, I recently found a dead dried up Lizard in my ottoman maybe I need to get one of those. Comfort movie(show) The simple life
“Are lobsters immortal”
did anyone let garrett know merc is in retrograde LMFAOAOAOAO
you look like zeke yeager. (derogatory)
garret it seems like the fae in your area is screwing with you. I may be wrong but definately resarch it. if you hear your name called in the woods, you find mushroom rings, or if animals try to lead you away (moving, stoping staring at you, then move about the same distance and stare at you.
Frankenwenie is definitely my comfort movie, I watched it so much when I was younger that when I rewatch it now, it reminds me of my childhood. That and the story was really well done and heartwarming
AYO IT'S MERCURY RETROGRADE
Your  tooth brushing spider probably isn't dead. I think something daft like 90% of 'dead spiders' we find in our houses are actually just their exoskeletons they've shed when they have grown so fingers crossed your little bathroom buddie is still going strong ❤️
My comfort movies are Misery and Secret Window
I don’t have comfort movies. Ig one could be boburnham inside. i watched it 16 times. a comfort tv show of mine is avatar the last airbender. i’ve lost count of how many times i’ve watched it lmao
YAAAAA new garrett content!
Matilda and toy story have been my comfort movies since I was a kid <3
Garrett! the spider's spirit was definitely watching over you in those woods 👼 my top 2 comfort movies are the fellowship of the ring and the lake house. both very different, but very wonderful movies to me lol
My comfort movie is 100% Harry Potter (count all of them as one lol) ❤ thanks for gracing us with another wonderful video 🙌🙌
This mercury retrograde hitting you hard isn’t it
Here we see Garrett losing his mind, but we always know Garrett will be okay because he’s got a wand
Garrett all’s I have to say is please! PLEASE! Never stop being you 😂 your amazing and We love you and your videos!
This video gave me so much anxiety
Garrett is such a free soul. It's so beautiful that he just goes and does these things on a whim ❤️ We should all be like him.
I've been in such a deep depressive episode the past month and listening to/watching Garrett and Andrew as 24/7 background noise has been one of the main things keeping me together and not feeling so lonely. I can't WAIT for more videos and podcast episodes :'^) these boys are a blessing to this world
ratatouille is my forever comfort movie or the grinch with jim carrey
13 Going on 30 makes me so happy. A definite comfort movie
My comfort movie is probably the princess and the frog. I watch it alll the time and my family is a little weirded out by it. My comfort show is izombie I have watched and rewatched it sooo many times it’s crazy. It’s hard for me to watch things I have never seen.
All I can think is what if this video ends with a really random cut off and then Andrew comes on screen… and he’s been crying and we find out that Garret died going out into the woods because he brought only a cinnamon broom and whipped cream as supply’s
Animal crossing direct and Garrett posted??? Blessed Friday
If Garrett and Bo burnham did a duet it would break the internet in the best way 🙌🏽🙌🏽
50 first dates is such a great movie, but my comfort movie is either Spider-Man into the spider verse or lilo and stitch! They never fail to cheer me up :) btw rip little spider dude ♥️
Oh boy, I've missed you!  This is the video I absolutely needed.
Was anyone else so stressed out Garrett left out food on the ground which literally will bring bears to him…..?
This was awesome!  My favorite comfort movie is The Princess Bride, I've seen it so many times I can quote it by heart.
to answer your question, my comfort movie(s) are the lotr trilogy and the hobbit trilogy, the middle earth universe has somehow become a comfort space for me and i just love it so much. if i was in middle earth i'd probs be a hobbit, what about you?
When it turned to nighttime, listen… peak anxiety and fear.    Also, I really want Andrews reaction to Garrett going into the woods with no equipment and only his favorite items lol
Yes! My day is made now!
The Smurfs Movie: The Lost Village. Watched it every day for 3 weeks at the end of 2019 when going through a really hard time, its my go to
So so excited when I saw you posted this video!!! Love it!!! My comfort movies are all over the place, like random as hell. But I have watched The Departed a bazillion times, also always ready to watch Scream, or Fried Green Tomatoes.... Just really random but whatever!! ♥🕷🏞🎃👻♥
My comfort movie is Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind (or anything by studio Ghibli) Or The Lord Of The Rings Movies,  or the Hunger Games.  There are too many
Stop because if I went camping and saw into garrets car without knowing it’s him I would be HORRIFIED and LEAVE
mine growing up was bewitched w will ferrel and nicole kidman, or miss congeniality
I wish I could have this much fun by myself lol
Pirates of the Caribbean - love ya Garrett !
I love his beard so much
A bearcrow
I know I'm middle aged because I kept thinking how nice his teeth are.
people have warned me that lumberjacks are handsome but holy shit i wasn't prepared for this level of hotness/cuteness
"Oh NO! My Hogwarts fell...AND IT BROKE!"  Harry Potter's last word before Voldemort Avada Kedavra'd him
My comfort movie would probably have to be the nightmare before Christmas, I can't stress enough how many times I've watched that movie in my life, I've probably spent more time watching that than anything else
Okay.. but are lobsters immortal???
A bear scarecrow  A bearcrow?
When garret posts reminds me that living on earth is enjoyable sometimes 🥺
My comfort movie is the 2005 Disney Channel Original Movie : Sky High 😁 such a classic. My entire family quotes the bus driver that says "SORRRREYYY!"
This remake of “into the wild” is weird…..
the fact that i didn't hear andrews name until 17:38 makes me real sad like.... where he at
my comfort movies r probably the nightmare before christmas or the first pokémon movie !!! thanks for this upload also garrett, missed u!!
streaming u on my tv is my favorite movie
youre even more handsome with a scruffier beard/longer hair... but i love a hairy man. rock it!
this is gonna sound weird but my 3 comfort movies are, in no particular order: - Jim Henson's Labyrinth - Howl's Moving Castle - Queen of the Damned
me the entire time I watched this: Garrett r u okay? Garrett noooo  babe nooo lmfao
Coco is 1000% my comfort movie too!
Howls flying castle is my comfort movie it's just a beautiful classic that makes me cry every time.
My comfort movie is fantastic mr fox
I love your singing so much!! Please sing in all your videos🖤🎵
Garrett makes me feel much less alone we are very similar and it makes me feel normal whenever he posts lol
It’s the “Are lobsters immortal” search for me 💀💀
my comfort movies are for sure a star is born with lady gaga & inside by bo burnhammmmm
the entire night at the museum trilogy is my comfort movie <3
My comfort movie is actually a show and it's Frasier...why?? Who knows but I always have it playing
My thoughts within the first 5 seconds of this video: The world has finally broken Garrett, he's run away from it all, & we need to find him 😳 (but then join him & have fun spooky awesome adventures with him 😁)
one of my comfort movies is Safe Haven. Good story.
OMFG mine is 50 first dates 💕
I’ve got Unsolved, H3, Watcher, and Garrett?! I don’t have time to watch all my shows in one night!! It’s the best problem ever!!!
Comfort movie is 100% Your Name Engraved Herein
the amount of trader joes products #living
My comfort movie is Mean Girls. 😌
Look at a map and look for green.
Honestly Garrett made me want to come out about this, my comfort movie is the early 2000’s hairspray… Attack me if you will but it’s low key good 😂 plus Garrett living in the woods to escape his problems is how I feel about temporarily binge eating a birthday cake when I’m even slightly stressed
I don't have any comfort movies, but my comfort music is owl city and the animal crossing sound track from the gamecube
My comfort movies are the first 3 pirates of the Caribbean films, attack of the clones, the phantom menace, captain America the first avenger, and toy story 2! (I know its a lot)
Finally! God his videos are so funny and just overall some of my favorite content on YouTube. ❤
As a part of a full-time RV family who spends half our time in Quartzsite(Arizona desert on the border with Cali, super quaint tiny town yet the largest RV convention in the world) and the other half in Flagstaff(Snowy Arizona mountain woodland near the Red Rocks and Grand Canyon) I find this manic search for nature amusing, kinda intriguing, and very slightly sad.
the happiest day- garret uploads :)
Okay but I also buried my pet spider a couple of days ago and have been reading a book about a guy who goes to live technology free in the woods so this is such a weirdly specific video 👀😂
It’s always a good day when Garrett uploads :)
If Brawny the paper towel man wore trifocals 😆 luv u Garrett
It always makes my heart so happy when Garrett uploads🥰I also bought a bone spider today purely because of Garrett and Andrew’s, I’ve wanted one ever since seeing it on their podcast and finally got my hands on one😂🤩
We’re the Millers is my comfort movie💕 always makes me laugh. And I love watching your vids and rewatch the sweet boys podcast to comfort me when I’m stressed😊 appreciate ya
My comfort movie is... either The Sound of Music or Once Upon a Time... In Hollywood
Now i will live in the wood so we can be neighbors
I like the beard :)
this channel is my happy place
Omg thanks for uploading. I had a sh*t day and really needed this. Thanks for the laughs love. My favorite comfort movie is Titanic. Is that weird? Lolz
I loveee when he posts !!!!!! Definitely 1000%  my comfort YouTuber ❤️
This was good for my mental state
my comfort movie is The Florida Project or Sweeney Todd lol
don't feel bad Garrett. I too only mostly have bandaids in my first aid kit... and some burn cream from when I almost set my kitchen on fire and tried to put it out by stomping on the blanket I put down to smother the flames..... that mostly made it worse. Thank god my boyfriend thought of baking soda.
You make me laugh so hard!! Thank you😊
Did you try sticking your phone in dry uncooked rice? it might help :3
My comfort film is the first Harry Potter and also probably captain America the first avenger
You're my comfort youtuber
I GET THAT SAME CINNAMON STICK EVERY YEAR
<33
my comfort movie... well I have a few - Mall Cop, Back to the Future, Night at the Museum, Fifth Element
I wasn't staring at the thumbnail of your last video hoping you'd upload soon 🙃
How you running away without a car?
I’m in auto insurance, cat converter thefts are up everywhere.
P.S. I want the answer😉
one of my comfort movies is alfred hitchcock's "Rope" for sure
the twilight movies are all my comfort movies and also any cheesy romance movie that you know how the ending is going to go but you watch it anyways just to see.
I think mercury retrograde hit you extra hard because you're a gemini and gemini is ruled by mercury
Garret, my face hurts so much from laughing. If you want to make movies I would give you all my money and show up at every premiere.
Garrett's content is unmatched. The amount of creativity and comedy is just straight-up impressive.
Okay, I was already attracted to Garrett, but Garrett with a beard? 🔥🔥  Also best comfort movies, Twilight saga 🤣
My big comfort movie is actually the one u brang up earlier in the video Spirited Away! The soundtrack, animation, story, the feeling of bringing me back to my childhood everything about it just makes me wanna cry ( in a good way).
My comfort movie is any Disney princess movie
what a wonderful 30 minutes :) I love when you upload!! and I have so many comfort movies! I sound basic, but lately Mean Girls.
When garrett says my name 🥺 1:46 he believes in me
I don’t really have a comfort movie but I guess I have comfort YouTubers. I love rewatching some of your videos, AmazingPhil, or Drawfee.
Comfort movie is Song of the Sea<3 Love your videos Garrett!!
my comfort movie is grown ups i have a lot of favorites but grown ups comforts me. also if i'm really having a bad week i'll watch the second one 😭🤍 makes me feel better, all the time. i don't know why, maybe it's cause i like to see what a healthy family looks like but yeah i hope your doing okay! 🤍
Garrett uploading made actually made my day 😊 also my comfort movie is Stand By Me
As chaotic as this is I needed this bc this was me earlier 😂😂
Okay but I understand wanting to continue watching cowboy bebop. That show slaps
A horror comedy where Garrett is a serial killer’s worst nightmare  🌈
It comes as NO surprise to me that Garrett fights the urge to go feral near-constantly
Agnostic does not mean what you think it means. 🤣
Sir, when is Sweet boys coming back?!
As someone that used to backpack and camp in the wilderness a lot, I am both concerned and happy for you
Dear Universe! give me strength you Crazy SEXY Unicorn Otter! 🥰😂
"Room temperature grapes"😂💞
Hey! I actually KNOW the Bit-O-Honey guy. He’s friends with my dad so I grew up on that candy. Neat.  I’m glad you like ‘em 💕
not you going out in the woods in shorts garrett 😨
Love you Garrett! My comfort movies Age of Adeline, upside down, star trek 2009, Jurassic park, Dr strange and tangled.... and making origami white watching!
Misssssed you Garrett <3 plz dont go away for that long again... also where is Sweet Boys
My comfort movie is Big Fish ❤️
Chocolat is a great comfort movie! Gotta love a movie that has a smart female lead, an imaginary kangaroo, chocolate,  and dame judi dench. The DVD was also stuck in my tv for 6 months so it was all i could watch… it was a good test to see how good a movie really is though.
I swear if this doesn't get on the trending page I am gonna be so mad
Comfort movies: Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets (the weazleys house just do it for me), Practical magic, Hocus Pocus, Love Actually and the twilight movies (there are probably more tbh)
also my comfort movie isssss x-men apocolypse lol
I'd be more worried about coyotes.... Lmao. They're bold if theres more than one of em
So I guess no one knows where Andrew is
Every marvel movies and series! ♡♡♡♤♧♡
I'm honestly impressed with Garret going to abandoned places and to the woods alone. I would be incredibly scared and anxious no matter my curiosity 😭
your videos make my day!!! definitely my comfort person 😂🙌
SCHOOL OF ROCK is my comfort movie. And mirror mask, which unfortunately not many people have heard of
This gave me so much anxiety because it’s so easy to get lost in the woods 😭
bestie this mercury in retrograde is hitting us hard 😫
garrett is having a whole mental breakdown n saying its a sign that he needs to leave everything behind im crying
Garrett.........my husband just leaned over and said "Is he wearing a coonskin hat?!?!?" OMGGGGGG LMAOOOO. He then realized it's Garretts hair. bahaahhaha. I think you look handsome Garrett!
Garrett! I missed your videos 🥺
Commenting for the algorithm
My comfort movie is Enchanted seeing Amy Adams in that movie as a child changed me fundamentally, also not a movie but I love Over the Garden Wall (and I think you would too if you haven't seen it!)
I've never needed a Garrett video more than ever. My ex came over unannounced and I freaked. So this is much needed.
there was no sassy teacup lady representing us😭
Hi Garret, I love your videos. Ps quick question. Whatever happened with Shane, Ryland, Morgan, Andrew and Drew? Do you still talk to them and hang with them? Sorry if I asked you the question. Ps I missed you so much.
My comfort movie is any Harry Potter or Moana
It’s hunting season! Lord you can really get hurt out in the woods. 🤦🏼‍♀️
If you ever drop your phone in water again make sure it's turned off and put it in a bag of dry rice and give it a few days to a week. The rice will pull the moisture out. I've done this and it saved my phone. So happy to see you posting. 🎃🐈‍⬛🎃
This is the most chaotic camping trip
How did Garett NOT reference Kill Bill when going into that trailer ???
Ok but all that facial hair makes Garrett more "Garrett" 🤣🤓
Omg Garrett! Take everything out of your freezer and unplug it. Let it thaw out overnight. The freezer cools the fridge part and if the freezer hole to the fridge is frozen over, no cold fridge. Kay, love you byeeee.
I really love your laugh
Why do you keep abandoning me? You said you were going to get milk and you never came back. 😭 Seriously though, when is Sweet Boys coming back? I miss you and Andrew!!!! Oh and my comfort movie is Stigmata.
mr fantastic fox :)
Catalytic converters are also being stolen in Maine and prob MANY other places, it's insane! Sorry that and everything else has happened to you 😔 but on the bright side I'm happy we get a video out of it 🤷‍♀️❤️
i would say my comfort movie would be scott pilgrim vs the word! (also rest in peace bathroom spider :)  )
It always makes me happy when you upload, you’re my comfort youtuber 😸  My comfort movie is Under the Tuscan Sun ☀️
Garrett! My mouth dropped open when you said your comfort movie is 50 First dates. That's mine too!!!!
It kind of depends on the type of comfort I'm looking for, if I need something to just sit in front of and pretend I'm not an adult, I'll go for something I watched a lot as a kid like Labyrinth or Matilda. If I'm specifically bogged down with the weight of modern problems, I'll watch something like 10 things i hate about you or mean girls, any teen-ish movie from around that era. But there's a specific kind of comfort I need sometimes that I don't know how to explain... and it comes from watching Bridge to Terabithia, specifically because (SPOILER ALERT I guess) the character with my name dies. I don't know why I need this sometimes but it gives me a really specific catharsis that I don't get from anything else.
My comfort movie is probably Harry Potter and the sorcerers stone or Howls Moving Castle ☺️🧚‍♀️
Ive missed you sm Garrett!! This upload made my day, also if you see Slenderman maybe give him a sweet little treat!
Imagine explaining this to the police if someone reported him for carrying a giant skeleton and a demonic doll into the woods
It's time to grow a man-bun and cultivate a ZZ Top beard!!!
Mine is definitely any Harry Potter movie.. Harry Potter is my happy place.. and of course your videos!!!!
!!Let’s go Brandon!!
But you are actually looking pretty good ;)
Man he's so prepared for the wilderness, he even has an possum on his head.
Garrett… what happened?
harry potter honestly if i'm feeling bad and i just wanna watch a movie i put on harry potter. RIP bathroom spider
garrett is channeling paul dano in swiss army man even the red flannnel shirt
I missed this big ball of chaotic cuteness. And the hair and beard look good imo. 👀
The thief and the cobbler bruh.. I used to watch it over and over.. and crush over the cobbler
Ten things I hate about you is my comfort movie, you're doing great!
So happy you didn’t die! My favorite comfort movie is “the day after tomorrow” 😊
Running away from our problems with a skeleton in the back seat is the vibe baybeeeeee. Also my comfort movie is the muppets Christmas carol 🤣🤣
Shrek 2 is probably  my favourite comfort movie. That or Trollz. That's pretty up there too. Also, great video as always :D
My comfort movie is The Wedding Singer. My dog died on Saturday and it’s been getting me through 💔
I feel like Garret's house is how my house would probably look when I get my own place
my comfort movie is howls moving castle <3 it was one of the first things i remember that brought representation to my japanese heritage, and even now, it helps me with my identity <333
Garrett is Shaggy in real life

Agnostic is basically "I'll just die and see what happens" this is actually what I'm going to start telling people😂
My comfort TV show is Impractical Jokers. For many years, those guys have been in the background of everything.
Bring back sweet boys ❤️❤️
Regarding the question at the end, my comfort movie is definitely Weathering With You. The movie may end on kind of a sad note but to me it is always very reassuring. Also I love the video Garret.

Comfort movies and such are probably Pretty Woman or rewatching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles episodes from the 90s

You’re such a skilled film maker. Your videos are always incredible

For me I'd say the movies that give me the most comfort are how to train your dragon (which is also my favorite movie), kung fu panda 2, the sound of music, and, this is so specific, but the air bud movie where the puppies become sled dogs. Don't ask me why cuz I don't know.
My comfort movies include the Wedding Singer, romcoms like the To All The Boys I've Loved Before movies and 13 Going on 30, disney movies etc.
I live in Northeast Arkansas and catalytic converter thefts have been on the rise here too!! It's everywhere! 😟

You would love to live where i am😁 I live next to a river with 23 acres of forest. One of the reason why we have beagles and malamutes(im in Canada😆) I'm sure you would hate the cold tho loll PS. Benjamin is very important for moral support😁
Oh no, the Prius. Though I've been waiting for you to buy the Kia Telluride of your dreams ever since I heard you mention it on a podcast a year or so ago 🚙
Wayne’s world! That movie makes me feel secure with the world and laugh every time 😂
I love that Garrett brought several plastic skeletons but no blankets 😂  Edit: if a forest ranger did come across Garrett that would be terrifying, the beard makes it look like he’s been there for a while
Sir…WHY are you out in the woods ALL ALONE when Halloween is approaching? Jason is coming for you I’m telling u bestie, RUN!
love ur channel && have been recently listening to sweet boys while i’m at work!!!!!! amazing video!!!!  comfort movie is… how to train your dragon & into the spider verse!!
garrett i always understand what you’re saying
I'm pretty sure I just witnessed a mania episode
This made my day 🥺🤣
you make me very happy
Garrett I’ve never felt so seen! When you were talking about being Agnostic, you spoke directly to my soul! You gave me words to describe my beliefs when I never knew how to before!
My comfort movie would probably have to be literally any of the high school musical movies. They are amazing and you cannot convince me otherwise. Also I love you Garrett so glad you uploaded!!
So glad to see you back have missed you Garret
My comfort movie is coraline, just makes me feel safe. <3 also your my comfort YouTube, I’ve been watching you for 3 years now, ily garret.

Some of my comfort movies are kinda sad. But the entire maze runner trilogy (death cure was my favorite), the outsiders, perks of being a wallflower.-- oh oh! and Monty python and the holy grail! Oh and newsies is always a good watch!
Loved this!!

My comfort movie is twilight unfortunately
I really like how you edited the thumbnail ! Caught my attention right away
My comfort movies are The Royal Tenenbaums, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (especially when I'm sick) , The Holiday, and Labyrinth.
You don't have to run to the woods, just another state.
I'm like 60 seconds into this video but have to say...  Garrett disappearing for a summer break and returning with a full beard and head of hair, saying he's going to run away into the woods is really giving me life.
My comfort movie would have to be Sweeney Todd
I'll just die and see what happens LOL 😜 yes yes and yes!!
I have a comfort tv show which is Adventure Time...I watch it whenever I have nightmares and can't sleep. Love ya Garrett.  Your videos are crazy and I love them.
What the hell seems suss u start posting haunted shit just after Shane stilling follwing in his bread crumbs So sad
This man brings no suffering and depression, just joy. Thank you, Garrett.
There aren’t very many films I can bear to rewatch, but I can always happily dip into O Brother Where Art Thou?
my comfort movie is mean girls. i don't know why
If someone saw him in the woods they would immediately assume he’s a murderer
Someone Great is my comfort movie!! It’s so sweet and reminds we that what will be will be. ☺️

It truly is a bones day ❤️
Hey catalytic converters are being stolen over here in Phoenix also! the whole world is just all going crazy 🙃
Garrett, you look great
​@Garrett Watts there are a massive amount of spam/scammers in the comment replies. It's on a lot of YT creators pages, but not all. Can you do anything to stop it?
Comfort movies are Howl's Moving Castle and The Original Power Rangers movie!!!
My comfort movie is lilo and stitch!
Garrett - "ow something bit my ass"  🧛 Me.
this video is a physical representation of my mental state for the last 3 months
Started an account on skillshare so that Garrett gets that coin ☺️😗
Best way to describe agnostic ever 💗💗😂😂
If you can't watch The Road to El Dorado 4 times back to back with ease you don't deserve that movie.
Raggedy Ann And Andy a Musical Adventure or You’re a Good Man Charlie Brown are my comfort movies!!!
You remind me of my English teacher in the best way possible I hope that makes sense
okay my comfort movie has always been George of the Jungle...I just really love Brendan Fraser man idk. Also I'm so glad you uploaded king.
It really is a Bones day for sure 'cos Garrett uploaded 😂
Watch into the wild
you are my spirit animal
Of course you uploaded on a bones day 🥰
My comfort movie is Howl's moving castle, and Moulin Rogue, and for some reason a random full playthrough of sonic 06 because the guys voice makes me feel all warm and cozy. (Not a movie but idc it serves the same purpose and I have watched it like 7 million times)
I like to many movies that comfort me
Literally in training for my new job and sooooo watching Garrett's new upload! 😂😁
We protect this earth angel at all costs.
this is a great video made by a great person keep it up!
Practical Magic & Hocus Pocus.
21:30 what the heck was that in the top right corner
Love this video, you’ve gotta come to oregon for the good good forest. It’s like a fairy tail, the ground is comfy soft moss instead of pine needles.  also i love 50 first dates - i have so many comfort movies, the hobbit, howls moving castle, the dark crystal- i just love movies
But did you pick up the trailer on your way back home? I sure would have! Free run down trailer!
It'll keep happening so you may want to invest in a shield when they get a converter for your Prius.
Yay, so glad for the new video ☺️, my comfort movie is Dirty Dancing or Singing In The Rain or the old Disney Cinderella movie
I MISSED YOU
i've never seen a man who embodies shaggy rogers from scooby doo's energy more
Yayyyy Garrett is back from his hufflepuff slumber 🥳 🧸
You are so wholeheartedly adorable! I love that you are your authentic self and no one and nothing will ever change you! Your my spirit animal! I don't think there is another human being as precious as you are Garrett! ❤️❤️
Ok it’s crazy how much Garrett looks like Zeke Yaeger.
My day just got 100x better when I saw Garrett uploaded. A smile is now painted on my face. :) My comfort film is Moulin Rouge or The Great Gatsby! I was kinda bummed when I couldn't jam out with you during your car ride!
Andrew needs to be with you 24/7 or you do shit like this 😂
So good seeing you again, glad you weren't eaten by a bear Comfort movies probably are the Care bears movie, the night they saved Christmas and gone in sixty seconds
100% Begin Again! such a comfort movie
Mercury retrograde killing us all
Garrett is my patronus. I felt this video on so many levels. I’m glad the bears didn’t eat you. 😂
51st Dates is my comfort movie. I've probably seen it 80 times. lol My close friend and I always quote it.
i love garrett because as soon as he says he has to “gather supplies” you already know it’s going to be the most random bunch of completely unnecessary items that just bring him joy lol (edit: watching garrett be in nature alone is incredibly anxiety inducing)
oh! at 27:10 it actually does turn into bo burnham’s special
I love you so much, you’re my escape into the woods and it feels amazing
My comfort movie is Kiki’s Delivery Service!!! It’s so wholesome and sweet. The animation and music is so beautiful and comforting. Also hearing Phil Hartman’s voice coming from a small black cat is just wonderful! I always makes me cry from pure joy!
Why does he lowkey look like jack stauber
I was so genuinely worried in the last few minutes even though I know you’re okay. My heart 🥺
My favourite Halloween lover has arrived ❤️🦇👻
Ponyo is my comfort movie, or Cheech and Chong up in smoke

YOOOOOO, I REALLY appreciate that Gorillaz statue of 2D you've got in the background at 7:12
Starting from 27:16 Garret giving off Zeke Yeager vibes ngl
Garret: “butter knife...gotcha b*tch!!”
Garrett you have no idea how much I needed to see this video...I very much relate to u in being goofy...also I'm currently struggling in college and I honestly liked what you did to run off and live in the woods even if it was to be goofy I wanted to just leave everything but, you've shown me that I need to appreciciate the many things I have now...Thank You Garrett also to answer your question on comfort movies...I've got my top 6  1. Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse 2. Fantastic Beasts and Where to find them 3. Lilo and Stitch 4. Coco 5. Spirited Away 6. Iron Man
when he pulled out the coffin he bought for the spider AND THEN the headstone, my heart melted and i dont even like spiders lollll <3
it’s rare that i feel like i actually have a friend in videos, but i do here. love you Garret <3
Garrett really went and did the same thing Hansel did that almost got him eaten by a witch
Go to Wisconsin/Michigan  for some dense haunted forested areas
garrett i swear to god if u jumpscare me……. i will be so unhappy
My comfort movie is the Titanic....Is something wrong with me? XD
Garrett, I love you so much, but dude
OMGGGG THE KING OF HALLOWEEN IS BACK
Feel good movie: Princess Diaries. I LIVE for Anne Hathaway, Julie Andrews, and Sandra Oh’s performances in that masterpiece. I watch it every time I’m sick or in a bad place mentally
garrett! so happy you uploaded today, had a pretty shit day and watching this at nearly 12am is a good end to it :)  comfort movie? probably the original willy wonka movie because every christmas i watch it with my family, and also because gene wilder .
I PAUSED AN EPISODE OF SWEET BOYS TO WATCH THIS <333
You are a national treasure please take care of yourself or is2g
i like how garrett is concerned about serial killers when he is a tall man in a tiny tent surrounded by skeletons anyone who sees that is running in the opposite direction
omg my comfort movie is any movie with Jack Black. especially School of Rock and The Holiday.
Kung-Fu Panda is my all time comfort movie. I love that movie
I hate to be this person but.. Garrett are you ok
my comfort movie is charlies angels :))
im in love with you
Garrett I just want to say that watching yours and Andrews podcast inspired me enough to push forward with my novel, and now my debut YA fantasy novel had been picked up by a publisher and is going to be out next fall. So thank you for being so awesome!
My comfort film is the one you put in the oven in a Vine you did with Colleen: Charlie and The Chocolate Factory🖕🏽
I really needed this video today - god Garrett’s channel is my happy place
I must be the only one who thought of Spellbound/Hi5 when Garrett was searching 'where are woods'....... Love your video Garrett!
GARRETTTTT WE MISSED U  DEER-LY ♥️♥️♥️
Soul is my comfort movie.  Also not a movie but the amount of comfort and joy Garrett brings me is unreal💛.
Garrett this might genuinely be the most stressful thing you’ve ever done… the sight of that tiny tent and the ABSOLUTE LACK OF SUPPLIES oh my god
I have so many comfort movies and videos. Just movies that I don’t mind watching over and over again despite me having already seen them. They aren’t that great either lol. I’d have to say Ocean’s 8. Very simple with pretty ladies. The Conjuring 1 and 2. They aren’t scary at all but still give a spooky vibe which I adore.
garrett i miss the podcast 💔
I desperately needed this post! I 💘 you Garrett!
Skillshare? This video should have been sponsored by Taco Bell.
right when i was craving a Garrett video
ugh i adore you.
Love this 😂 Comfort movie is How To Train Your Dragon :')
My comfort movies are Talladega nights and MIB..I'm not proud lol
GARRETT. i got my catalytic converter stolen in january. it’s no joke.. and an expensive repair. i drive an ‘08 prius and she’s barely hanging on as it is. godspeed.  my comfort movie is either the 2007 hairspray or the 1978 grease movie w john travolta.  also BOY have I missed you! glad you’re back, friend.
I missed you!! I was watching you old videos just yet 😅
Midsommar is my comfort movie, not very comferting, because I hate myself!
This Blair witch 3 behind the scenes is interesting...
Wow did he age 10 years?!?!
my comfort movie is treasure planet!  watched it every day for a whole year when it came out and i can recite whole scenes :)
i was legitimately rewatching your videos and then saw you uploaded... i'm gonna say i manifested this
I'm going to buy my mother a cinnamon broom now. I think she'll love it???

Ugh finally your back ❤️😫
The Parent Trap with Lindsay Lohan and Matilda are my comfort movies 🍿 always down to watch either
Hi Gareth, take care in the wilderness hope Andrew is going with you xxxx
I miss sweet boys🥺
Not me looking into his Dreamy blue eyes
Kill Bill volume 1 has always been my comfort movie for some reason 😂
Can we just appreciate how Garrett got daddy long legs a coffin and a headstone 🥺. Too precious Garrett!! Also my comfort movie is beauty and the beast. But I’m more tv person so golden girls and Walker Texas ranger (the original not that new one 🙄)
Garrett mercury is in retrograde and you're a gemini. Us geminis are suffering rn
garrett has a whip for unknown reasons
Garrett… you are a doll, I wanna be your friend in real life so badly. (Comfort movie… “Weekend at Bernies”)
My comfort movies are The Little Rascals and Dennis the Menace, even though I’m a full grown adult… I build my Lego stuff and watch them after a hard day.   Post more please! Even if it’s garbage. We don’t care we just want long videos of you and your chaos!
garrett are you okay
My comfort movie is the LOTR trilogy. I put it in at the beginning of the weekend and find the largest Hoodie I have. 🫀🫀🫀
This made me miss the spooky boys 👻🖤
My favorite is Garrett. That is all.
my comfort movie is the polar express 😅
I can’t deny my two comfort movies are Sky High and Anastasia
Comfort movies are Queen Of The Damned & To Wong Foo Thanks For Everything.   Btw the draggin the tiny skeleton through the dirt sent me 😂
When Garrett uploads I get a battery recharge on my life so I can keep existing
My comfort movies gotta be, Dead Poets Society, Big Hero 6, Tangled, and literally every Tinkerbell movie ((:
My comfort move is “Xanadu”. When I’m feel down, depressed or anxious I play this movie. 🕊
I have a lot of comfort movies as well but one of them is Labyrinth (with David Bowie) I love the Harry Potter movies as well but its hard to watch the last two cause they're so sad.😭 (don't judge me).😂
The Fall (2006) a masterpiece I literally LITERALLY know by heart and still watch it a couple of times a year. And also COCO damn
You could look like Equate by Walmart Garett and we would still say you look like a cherub with the most beautiful glow and it could be sweat. We still love you lol
Love u Garrett
JENNIFERS BODY
how to train your dragon is my comfort movie :)
This is my favourite video on YouTube 🥰🐻🌳
My comfort film is any Land Before Time movie (but especially the Journey to Big Water one) BIG BIG BIG BIG WATERRRRR
I have checked out from society to my friend. I live back a holler. At the end on 33 acres... with my soulmate, my 5 dogs and 🐔 😆🤣 ... my closest neighbor isn't close enough to see. But im only 1 mile from our lil town. So it's kinda perfect. Hope you are blessed 🙌🙏
MATILDA! to answer your question
Woof. Garrett with beard is something else.
In all honesty my comfort movie is Monster High: Frights Camera Action 😂 I am 20 and will not stop watching this movie till I DIE.
My day gets 100% better when I see Garrett upload
See ya in another 6 months girlie
“i got this for my nephew,, for his birthday when he turned 4,, but i forgot to send it to him,, and how he’s almost 10, so” oh my GOD i cannot stop laughing 😭
something nice to be posted after 🤢 decided to come back
I'm so happy you didn't get eaten by a bear:( I'm so very glad

My comfort movie is definitely Mama Mia! And The Grinch!
You know it's an amazing day when Garrett uploads :)
私はあなたをとても愛していますあなたはいつも私を幸せにしてくれるギャレット❤️❤️
No other word can describe your personality other than mood.
my comfort movie is definitely Moonrise kingdom or Palo alto... they remind me a lot of high school and nostaligia and i used to watch them on dvd 30 times a day i could never ever get tired of them
You just made my day better💕
Honestly my comfort movies are Ella Enchanted and Tangled! I've watched them so many times. Oooh and 13 Going On 30!
Garrett your Bo Burnham arc in this video is exquisite I bet you could release it on Netflix and call it Outside and then hopefully Phoebe Bridgers will cover the song you sing towards the end   also my comfort movie is 10 Things I Hate About You
i think a comfort movie for me is really anything space related, gets me to stop thinking of what problems i have in my life and just imagine everything else life could be. Or The Office lol
* garretts expensive adult things break, and he comes on the internet to do a video for a sponsorship so he can get money to fix them* Garrett I wish you made videos for us 🥺🥺🥺
from homeless man to lumber jack guy
My comfort movie is The Holiday starring Queen Latifah. It's. So. Good.
Thank you such much for uploading Garrett, I missed these vibes so bad. Honestly not in a great place right now and your videos somehow make me feel less alone just for a little while. Also, my comfort movie is super lame but I've watched it hundreds of times and been obsessed with it for years, it's Simply Ballroom.
I literally jumped at the tree falling on you 😂😂😂😂😂
My comfort movie is Merlin, the made for tv version. I Love Frik.
Wait 50 first dates is my comfort movie too on some level

love love love love
Garrett! Can we be friends that would be pretty dope thansk
Comfort movie... I would have to choose Dragonheart.
GARRETT, try putting your phone in dry rice, I did that with my dad’s phone and it genuinely works, which is fuckin wild
A Goofy Movie gets me pretty good. I always said I'd marry Max just to be able to say Goofy was my dad. I know, I have Daddy Issues. But c'mon- it's GOOFY.
my comfort movie is probably Jurassic Park, or the first avengers, of the truman show, or dead poets society or
Garrett you are absolutely an amazing person :)
Gaarrreeettt! My comfort movie is 50 first dates!! and i love when you sing !!!
I've been listening to Sweet Boys before bed to keep the demons away and it works. So thank you for that and also for uploading on a rough day. <3
Garrett i love u. Thank u for being unapologetically u❤
Sweeney Todd is my comfort movie! Don’t know what that says about me 🤔
my comfort movies; pride and prejudice, ever after, matilda and peter pan (2003),, movies I would always watch when I was a kid and would fall asleep to them often as well.  ❤
i missed you sweet sir
Hey Garrett, you've been missed :))
garrett reminds me too much of a lumberjack
Comfort watches lately - 90s movies, marvel movies, the mummy movies ( really any brendan frasier film), downton abbey (series), what we do in the shadows, Bluey (cartoon)
I’m not a car person so I wouldn’t know, but Garret’s car is in the shop getting fixed so often that I’m fully convinced it would be cheaper just to get a new one 😂😂😂 like, the cost of getting all those repairs has gotta outweigh the cost of a car at this point
Loved this, Garret!  My comfort movies are Mononoke Hime, Pride and Prejudice 2005 and the Haunting of Hill House/Bly Manor series💕
My comfort movies are definitely Transformers, any Marvel movie and Pirates of the Caribbean 💕 probably a few more but this are the elite! I missed you and your lovingly weird videos💛
thanks for the serotonin bff
Garrett's laugh is so cute
So excited to see a Garrett video today! My comfort movie is definitely School of Rock. It always makes me laugh and warms my heart
What if the abandoned trailer, was the trailer and kill Bill. I mean that would be pretty cool.
We are truly being spoiled today with this amazing human's presence!! Favorite comfort movie is the Lizzie Mcguire movie
I’ve missed you so much it hurt 😭😭😭😭 I’m literally so happy to see your little face again and hear that precious laugh of yours!  I’ve never seen such mega frantic manic energy from you than in this and it exhausted me so goodness knows how you feel!! Thank you for blessing us With a video!! I mean it is Halloween month!!💕👻
Lol I was about to come put Coco as my comfort movie and then Garrett said it at the same time
When garret uploads u know ur days about to be a banger
Comfort movie is probably Princess Bride or LOTR.
♡♡♡♡!!!!
One of my comfort movies lately is Corpse Bride! I just made a video about it. Others: harry potter, twilight (they're fun to laugh at okAY), palm springs, your name, fantastic mr. fox, into the spiderverse, tim burton's charlie and the chocolate factory, the perks of being a wallflower and SHREK

Garrett your amazing ❣️ you always make my day when I see your video 🙂
if you run away from your problems, then they simply stop existing 😌
he looks like a werewolf…  but in a good way.
20:21 my favorite part of the video
this is like one of those documentaries where they show how the person slowley fell into insanity.
Garrett your accidental poem added 10 years to my life i'm pretty sure so thank you for that... also my comfort movies are pride and prejudice and bee movie. yes i said bee movie and no im not proud of it
“OW! Something bit my ass!”             -Garret 2021

What happened to Sweet Boys does anyone know?
anyone else’s comfort movie labyrinth?
I am VERY glad that bear didn’t eat you. What would we do without your awesome silly videos? I smile through the whole thing. Thank you for the smiles!
R.I.P to the Prius but I’m glad Garrett got a more reliable vehicle 🙌 but as you can see Garrett your new jeep cost wayyyy more for gas so you might wanna start uploading more lol if you feel up to it of course!
Comfort movie! Good Burger!
Bratz fashion pixiez is my all time favourite comfort movie
Lmao I love you Garrett.
best boy lumberjack.
bear scarecrow!? call that a *bearcrow*
My comfort movie is How To Train Your Dragon and Legally Blonde!!! I love those two movies so much.
could've saved going to all this trouble if someone had just told him Mercury was in retrograde
alwayysss a good day when garret posts 🥰
my comfort movie is hairspray ! I know the lyrics to miss Baltimore crabs like the back of my hand
The woods are too scary for my small 5'1 self haha, A tree branch would absolutely crush me. Also my comfort movies are Jennifer's body and But i'm a cheerleader, i'm a sucker for 2000s movies with obvious or subtle gay plots
My favourite comfort movie is 17 again. I always watch it on my birthday so I’ll be watching it tomorrow!!! 🎂🎂
Garrett’s channel is an existential crises
You are so sweet and I am so happy to see you in a new video 🖤🖤🖤
Comfort movie...Scott pilgrim vs the world for sure
3:22 has me dead
Garrett is my spirit animal.
What's your opinion on climbing trees?
My comfort movies are Under the Tuscan Sun, Addam's Family, and Beetlejuice :)
My favorite month has all of my favorite things come back like spooky home decor, cute clothes and jewelry, tasty food, and Garrett 🖤
I would have to say right now because my comfort movies change is the fear Street trilogy on Netflix. But an old faithful would be all the  Harry Potters.
What a treat , thank you for uploading! I also want to run away from the city🙂🙃 You look amazing btw, hope you upload some spooky Halloween videos soon👻🎃👻🎃👻🎃👻🎃👻🎃👻🎃👻🎃👻  P.S I hope season 2 of the podcast is coming next year. I have listened to some of the episode multiple times bc I miss them 🤣🤣🤣
My comfort movie is the Nightmare Before Christmas definitely !
my comfort movie used to be call me by your name until one of the actors became a cannibal
YES! I swear I'm psychic, I was rewatching his older uploads today thinking it's about time he came out with a new one and BOOM! Here it is
This cheered me up a lot after a bad day, always a nice treat when we get a surprise upload. 🥰
My side of the mountain looks different here
h-how did he fit the butter knife in that small container
Was hoping to see a new video from you popup since Shane has been posting new vids.. Great to see that you didn't bring back a poisonous spider too! :)  *imagines Garrett looking all over his house for any hitchhikers from his expedition*
My comfort movie is nightmare before Christmas! Missed seeing ur vids mountain man ;) hope it gets better for u!
It gets more and more tempting to run away to the woods everyday
My biggest comfort movie is 13 going on 30 because it reminds me of my grandma who passed away last year
Not a movie but rewatching the spooky boys
First the pug has bones and now garret gave us a video!!!! All hail Noodle the 13 yr pug!!!!
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
My comfort movie right now is Scream! I love the camp, the horror, the blood, the weirdly but beautifully homoerotic tension between Billy and Stu-- and it has Monica from Friends!! (I watched Friends before Scream, I know she's technically 'Gail from Scream' before she's 'Monica from Friends', but my time is different so there.) Honorable mentions are: The Social Network (the score makes me cry and I'm gay for Andrew Garfield), Heathers (the musical counts too! Winona Ryder is... The Moment), and The Princess Bride (it's a childhood classic <3 ).
hot
my comfort movie is definitely how to train your dragon haha, that or like all the lord of the rings movies (extended ofc)
today isnt the best but i know that when garrett posts a vidoe i gotta get my tacobell and sit at my laptop....and i did just that
My comfort movie is howel’s moving castle 100% seen it at least 100 times
....what moulin rouge song was it?
Garrett for the love of God hire an assistant lol. They can deal with all the crazy problems and you don't have to adult at all. Or go hang with Shane, you need a control freak in your life lol.
Benjamin shows up in like all of his videos yet I'm always startled when he's on screen
comfort movie : perks of being a wallflower
i think u just maybe invaded a part of the forrest where hunters run around. they dont want humans there bc they could scare away the animals.
I really love your videos and attitude. ☺️ I wish I lived in la.♥️  My comfort movie is Big Fish...  You can always make life what you want it. ✨
Found bones keeps camping
My comfort movies are The Wedding Date and 13 Going on 30. Love those movies so much. they're my go-to chick flicks

I want to be your Friend💓 the fact that you bury you spider friend and you buy happy meals for rats and make the rat in you backyard a cake is something I would do lol. tho you have much more energy and flair.  My comfort movie when I am sick Is puff the magic dragon its something left over from my childhood.
My comfort movie is easily back to the future part 2
My comfort movie is the twilight movies. They are awful BUT, they remind me of going to the cinema, sneaking in booze, getting lamped and ripping the piss out of them with my friends. And that’s a nice memory.
i was just rewatching ur last videoOoOoOo :,D ily
i was just binge watching all ur videos last night omg hi
my comfort movie is princess and the frog, also, not a movie, but adventure time obviously
Garrett you should try out hiking. Do small steps before the bigs ones lol although it does make for good entertainment :) My comfort movie is Pride and Prejudice( the one with Colin Firth) i never get sick of it.
Comfort movie 100% is Perks of Being A Wallflower 💚💚💚
“Woods with no bears” we only need Garret’s Adult Teddy Bear™️
I have already watched this twice and can't wait to come back 50 more times 😌 ily Garrett
Definitely need more Garrett content in my life.
You’re in Knowhere, clearly.
Mrs. Doubtfire
Dead Poets Society, Princess Bride, and Devil Wears Prada are my top 3 comfort movies. (And OBVIOUSLY Lord of the Rings {extended editions only} and the Hobbit trilogy)
I was just wondering the other day it Garrett was doing alright…. Apparently the answer is no
I love you but I have to report this video to the police 😆 are you okay?!?! What was this? 😂
This video was soooo funny! I died multiple times 😅😂 my comfort movie is The Other Sister :)
Is it just me or does Garrett look like Giles from buffy? -without the beard
My comfort movie is either Oliver and Company or Pretty Woman, weird combo idek why
Your fridge is probably an easy fix. If you have too much crap in the freezer it won’t be able to recycle the air to the fridge, or you may need to just defrost it. Worst case scenario is the evaporator fan is out. It’s not difficult to replace, but I don’t think you would want to do it.🤷‍♀️😘 Erica Badu♥️
The woods are fun I've only been like once and that was only walking in the woods to go to my brother's friends house... Cuz I didn't want to walk on the road... Like it was woods like right behind people houses... And it was when the killer clown stuff is happening...  Every time a leaf got stepped on or something I thought it was a killer clown...
Scooby doo (2002), my favourite movie and I watch it at least once a month
HONEY WAKE UP,  there’s a new Garrett video!!!
Garrett i wanna hug you 🤗🤗🤗
My comfort movie is How To Train Your Dragon
This made my whole day! Thank you for blessing us with your content💪💪💪
My comfort movie would probably be Holes. It was a favourite when I was a kid and it’s just so perfect. Also people steal Catalytic converters here too! And I live in a small city in northern Ontario!
Love love love your videos and the editing is SO good dude. Also, my comfort film is Eagle vs Shark (2007). I honestly think you might enjoy it! It's quirky n cute :^)
My comfort movie is Captain Marvel <3
My movie is heart and souls with Robert downy jr. I had the tape and watched it twice a day every day. You know, before cell phones and stuff.
I miss Andrew … I’m curious what he‘s been up to 🤔. Garrett and Andrew are both so talented and creative!
Ugh I love you so much
Honestly I've never felt more known than the skeleton bit because I have a skele friend that sits by my bed and watches me sleep.  They also keep track of time, you know. Inevitably of death, do things while you're still around. Momento Mori and all that.   I still need to dress both of them up in suits.  Also ugh the end questions super hard cause it depends on the current focus but uhhhhhhh no. NO. I KNOW. BOOK OF LIFE. I can watch it over and over forever because it's unironically such a good movie.
When the tree fall on you I screamed..
haven’t even started, but already liked because i know this is gonna be a good video ❤️
Omg yay. My dream is to live in the woods some day thankfully I live in Ireland so we have nothing but woods trees grass and beautiful nature. Xx😊
Was looking u up to rewatch some old videos and was so delighted to find a new one!! (My comfort movie is the lego Batman movie😂💞)
This chaos makes me wanna embrace my impulses more
your flannel shirt shows your commitment to the lifestyle 🌲
Okay but seeing his search history has me wondering ARE lobsters immortal??  also I'm so happy seeing/hearing Garrett again! I've missed him!
Yay !!!!!
my comfort movie is how to train your dragon! cheers me up any day of the week any time of year, i love dragons <3

My “comfort movie” is actually all 8 seasons of Portlandia, on repeat, for YEARS. My fiancé immediately puts it on anytime I start having anxiety attacks. Works better than Xanax. Love you, funny lil Garrett. 🖤
Garrett searching for woods by L.A. is literally me trying to do anything ever
my comfort movies are Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990) and Pride and Prejudice (2005) i know them by heart and watch them an annoying amount
My comfort movie is 100% The Pagemaster! I could literally watch it all day long haha 💕 and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
“I thought this was gonna be zen as hell” 🤣🤣🤣
A 'BEARcrow'!
You know it’s a bones day when Garrett uploads
dooood can I come over and play Blair Witch??
I can't imagine not knowing who garrett is , and you run into him in the woods .. " A really tall man with long beard , he had a few skeletons with him, a creepy baby , a Teddy bear, a shovel and a sword " i can't HAHAHHA just imagine this people making up stories on creppy pasta.
Your laughter and beard brighten my day.

I love the facial hair actually
Hiii!! I just got off work and so excited to see the joy in my life that is Garrett 😊
The mummy I can quote that movie start tok finish or Penelope with Reese wethersppon 😂
I have a long list of comfort movies! Ace Ventura pet Detective Any of the vacation movies but especially Christmas vacation Just go with it  Home alone lost in New York Carpool Murder mystery  Elf  Blended  Ferris Bueller‘s Day off Kind of a long list. All of these movies are ones I like to watch when I am doing art!
My comfort movie is the Night at the Museum franchise😅 something about those movies just takes me back to when I was younger, and I loved seeing Robin Williams as Teddy Roosevelt, and just the whole majesty of it all was so cool as a kid
I've never related to anyone's intros more than I have today. The universe always seems to send me messages, and for some reason I still haven't figured out to stop talking myself out of following my instincts.... 🙃  Also last time I checked, driving in the car pool lane with something like a mannequin in the front seat, is technically legal, but you should put the seat belt on it because it can become a projectile in the event of a crash. 👍
comfort movie is zootopia, dont judge me pls.
I remember Shane saying how some people turned there back on him during one of the lowest points of his life (aka his cancelation) for their career   Its soo clear that its you and Andrew who so quickly decide to turn your backs on him when you didn't benefit from being friends with him anymore  In other words goodbye
I Love you Garrett 💗
My fridge has done the same thing! Mu freezer fine... but making weird noises too!!
I got instant serotonin only 1 second into the video. I love u Garrett 🧡
Where is the Sweet Boys podcast? Seems like it's been forever.
My comfort movie is probably The Lost Boys. Idk if anyone out there has seen it, its basically a cheesy 80s vampire movie, it means a lot to me though :)
Ok Shane posting videos and now you?! This is the best week of my life!! Love the video, and love you, but please be safer next time, I’d be very sad if you were tragically eaten by a bear.  My comfort movie is pitch perfect or he’s just not into you 💙💙
But, did you finish Cowboy Bebop?
Coco is my current comfort movie too!
my comfort movie is anything Winnie the Pooh 🍯 because I watched it a lot when I was little 💗
I’m the ice cream man, cuz the ice cream can 🎶 That song is forever stuck in my head 😋

my ultimate comfort movie is school of rock. jack black teaching kids rock n roll and how to love themselves all at the same time? it’s impossible for me to be in a bad mood when i watch that movie
Everytime you post I have to remind myself the entire way through that you probably wouldn't have posted it if you'd died
Good Will Hunting or Call Me By Your Name comfort movies
Just wanna say, Garrett, this made my day. You are a JOY!  I woke up late, had a crick in my neck, didn’t sleep well, I could go more into detail, but I’ll spare you lol … my day started out bad, I’ll just say that. And your video made me laugh so much and out loud .. thank you! You are a beautiful person and I love it.
Not the whip 😳
SPIRITED AWAY IS AMAZING ✨
Glad your back! I have many comfort movies that I rewatch, but one is “Runaway Bride” with Julia Roberts & Richard Gere. The soundtrack makes me want to sing along. It’s considered the reunion of the Pretty Woman cast as both the director, Garry Marshall, & a bunch of the cast we’re part of both.
My comfort movie has to be Barbie Princess and the Pauper. It's simple, sweet and nostalgic
My comfort movis are Princess bride,the fifth element and fern gully. :)
My comfort movie is literally frozen 2 or the Harry Potter movies, they do be chaos buuut ✨comfortable✨
Garrett hear me out. Do fall activities with Andrew (like drink psl and pumpkin picking like white girl Instagram lmao) OR A HAUNTED HOUSE IR CARVE PUMPKINS OH MY GODDDD
My comfort movie is grown up 1 and 2….I watched theses movie biblical. It remind of the time when I didn’t have to care about school or emotion. It was just me and the movie and nothing else.
My comfort movies are Clueless and Ferris Bueller’s Day Off
I missed you 😘
I don't know why Benjamin is so funny to me but I legitimately snort laughed when Garrett said "Or no more toes" and then laughed even harder at the fact that I snorted over the joke.
I have you beat Garrett. This past month I broke up with my bf and my Mom, whom I live with, went to the hospital and has a serious illness. Also my rent is going up on top of now having to pay my bf's half of the rent. I have to come up with like $750 more per month somehow for all the bills. But I can't move for another year because we started a new lease. Help. 😭😭😭
Whens the podcast coming back bestie??
Saving this for when I have a 12 hour night shift, Garrett's energy will keep me going!!
they tried to steal my catalytic converter too <3 only got through one side lol
my comfort movie has gotta be labrynth at the moment, garrett I highly recommend, it helps me forget real life
Nah fam garret always looks snatched
Garrett summing up that Mercury in Retrograde energy within the first 4 minutes. I feel you, mate 👍

Aliens and Nirvana  Me too man
the bo burnham bit at the end was so good
I've been missing Garrett!! So happy for the upload. Great editing btw😊 Hope everyone has a great weekend.
i like how garrett addressed the “dna kidz bop” in his search history but not the “are lobsters immortal”
My comfort movie is spirited away or honestly any studio ghibli films I absolutely love them 💗 also I'm glad you didn't get hurt too bad out in the woods lol
You are back OMG I am verry happy
8 minutes in and all I registered was Garret’s Lupin figure.

My favorite comfort movie is while you were sleeping
Oh man comfort movies? Holes, and diary of a wimpy kid rodrick rules.
Welcome back!!
the excitement i got seeing this on my subscriptions page
How the hell is Garrett ever gona become an old man? Like I can see him being a cooky old man. But the serious years before then just don't exist.
We need Garett everyday I swear. The world needed this 💗I love this look, how is someone not grabbing this man and never let go. The most adorable human on earth. Also, let's those of us that like Garett we are the best. Why does he not have a full time show seriously.
I needed this video, thanks Garrett :)
I don't know about movies, but my comfort tv show is definitely the 2003 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series.  I always put on some episodes when I'm not feeling great.
I have so many comfort movies but Monster House has to be my main for October, or Paranorman.

garrett. you are my favorite and such an amazing creator! please never stop making videos.
a lot of my comfort movies are early 2000s chick flicks and comedies, like Legally Blonde and Devil Wears Prada. Although, disney movies from 1990 to like 2010 are really good ((Lion King cough cough)) I totally dont have that entire movie memorized,,,, and the sequel,,,
My comfort movie has to be Disney’s Robin Hood. I love putting it on and going to sleep with it in the background it’s just so calm and nice.
I can't believe you actually fit in that tent! It's so small! hahahaha
Even though I knew you would have had to make it back to edit and upload the video, I was preeeetty nervous for you for a while there. I'm always so happy after watching your videos, thanks for making my day!  My comfort movie is Howl's Moving Castle, I don't even remember the first time I saw it, I just know that deep down I too am an extremely powerful fire demon.
garrett carrying out my adhd brain compulsive ideas is just *chefs kiss*
This whole video stressed me out so much I kept yelling at my screen like one does while watching a horror movie and seeing someone walk into the manor of DOOM
Mine is Beetlejuice. When I was a kid I made my mom rent the vhs so many times the little mom and pop rental place just gave it to me cause I was the only one who rented it for like two years. 😅
Ngl, the beard-game is pretty strong and he looks awesome 👀✨
Garrett is the voice I needed in my head while I was getting through high school.
RIP Bathroom spider! I have a bathroom spider too he's cool though because he's not  big and intimidating like the one that showed up in my bed recently! Nope nope nope nope nope. No snuggling  thanks. Also my favourite comfort films to watch are up, amelie and yes man ❤️ 🥰 peace and love yall xxx

I think my comfort movie would be labyrinth... Or strange magic... Or rocky horror picture show..
1. I told you not to post this until my class was over, but you posted it right in the middle 2. Did you watch unus annus? Because they had 1 rule about being in the woods and you completely disobeyed that 3. This was a fun journey to watch, thank you, I love you more 4. My comfort show is definetly Mary Poppins
Porco rosso or spirited away. I love all studio ghibli movies.
Comfort movie is Lord of the Ring trilogy, and Jurassic Park 😂
I would be lying if I said I have never thought about doing this before!
Death Becomes Her is my favourite comfort movie.   So nice to see you in my notifications, thanks for the vid Garrett & Happy Halloween!!!
my comfort movies are definitely like shrek and harry potter, but actually last night i was thinking about my comfort video game, the iSpy Spooky Mansion PC game. such a classic i wish i still had it with me (its in storage somewhere but idk where lol)
You have so many friends that can help you do so many things (detective friend for bones, rich guy? Friend for the haunted location keys, business friend for Post Malone) that, at this point, i think you have the gta cheat codes of everything, except it’s the cheat codes of life!  Anyway, have a good day! :)
THE WAY THUIS MADE MY ENTIRE YEAR! I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH
Garrett is my favourite human on this plain of existence.
Honestly any studio ghibli movies are comforting but id have to say Whisper of the Heart has always comforted me the most. Also im happy you didn't get eaten by a bear in the woods😊❤
Please upload more 💜💜
If your fridge is a GE with the freezer on the bottom, then there’s a fan towards the bottom of the fridge part that’s broken. It’s a common problem with them.
"Being agnostic is just, I'll just see what happens when i die lol"  I scream laughed, its so true though. Kinda looking forward to it just to see what happens 😹😹
Have a great day mr watts 🥲 thank you for the video!!
Thank you for the humourous video it makes no sense that made my day👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
My ultimate comfort movie is Heathers because it's just a mix of fight club and mean girls which are also my comfort movies
I literally JUST saw a TikTok of a girl finding out her catalytic converter was stolen while she was at work
My comfort movie is Things We Lost In The Fire purely because I’m in love with Benicio Del Toro and David Duchovny
In that one clip you kinda sorta sounded like Winnie the pooh out in the hundred acre woods
People are stealing those parts in RV's and Motor Homes in my City too in Canada, its actually our of control LOL
I am so sorry your Hogwarts broke Garrett!! 😭 That sounds like such a stressful week, thank you for the video, I loved it!! Sending best wishes from regional Victoria, Australia 😍
Make a PO Box so we can send you stuff!
All of Garrett’s videos involve no impulse control and I am living for it
New video new life
Please never call yourself unattractive because you're so beautiful 💜 and if anyone says anything mean to you then punch them into the moon 🌙👦🤛
Haunted Honeymoon is my comfort movie, and NOBODY seems to know what it is! Which is a real shame.
Gee wonder why so many people are leaving LA?….
i have a couple of comfort movies. one is the parent trap (with lindsay lohan and her TWIN, obvi) and pride and prejudice
fantastic Mr.fox is a current comfort movie but one that never changes is labyrinth/any puppet movie :)
Despicable Me is my favorite comfort movie
I know how hard it is to create a content but we really need more of you! Lots and lots more!
The amount of connections Garrett has is honestly and truly beyond me....0.0   {p.s. my favorite comfort movie is the original little women and the corpse bride (my favorite movie of all time), and of course a few others but those would be my main two}~
I love 50 First Dates. My favorite comfort movie is Little Women from 1994, soooooo many great actors!
Why does running and living in the woods still seem better than real life? Even after all that.  Also my comfort movies are Tag, The Producers (2005, Nathan Lane), and Spaceballs.
Garrett, you silly bean, you don't need to run into the wood mercury is just in retrograde, everything is supposed to be going wrong :D
Your life feels like a real life version of what happens after you finish the main storyline and now are just doing random side quests and getting collectibles ❤️
TANGLED is my comfort movie!
I will always love whatever you make Garrett :)
Hit the like button before the video even started lol ❤❤❤
Tommy boy 💯 my comfort movie 😅
Aw my comfort creator posted when I needed him the most <3
I’m with ya on buggin out of this society. It’s crazy out here.
I don't usually watch your content but I actually love the new you. Hopefully we will all be living in the woods looking like shit after this mf goes down. It'll be good for us 😆🥰
He's Ryan's bottom,  and Ryan is Shane's bottom.....hello Colorado
If The tournamented souls inside Benjamin shouting at Garrett to get out weren't enough now he has to deal with all of that stuff :(
What a lovely adventure, and the hair suits you 😊 ponyo and mean girls are my comfort movies.
You're like if Dwight and Michael morphed as one for the 'survivor' episode
My comfort movie is twilight if I’m in a silly mood I can watch it and laugh and if I’m sad I can pretend that it’s a good romance movie and feel more sad but I watch the whole series every time
Twilight the first movie
My cousin got her catalytic converter stolen in Arkansas. It's happening everywhere, sadly
my comfort movie is the grinch and it is also my fav movie but i found a lot of comfort in the nightmare before christmas so yeah :)
Definitely move out of there. I moved by the beach what I thought would be my dream something told me to move. I had 10 parking tickets my chakra bracelet broke around my roomates found out I wasent on the lease and they’d been stealing my rent 🙃
I have a list of comfort movies on my phone for when I need them! Here's some: the fugitive, lego batman movie, tangled, Paddington, West Side Story, and any of the iron man or spiderman movies. also the sorcerers apprentice if anyone remembers that one lol
Uncle Buck is my comfort movie. No matter my mood - Uncle Buck is a cure all. Though sometimes I just want to watch Patrick Wilson sing Elvis in Conjuring 2.
Omg Garrett! 50 first dates is my ultimate comfort movie
I watched Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban every single night to fall asleep for over a year so probably that!
We've missed you! October wouldn't be the same without your videos!
I needed this💞
your videos are my favourite flavour of chaos :)

School of Rock is my comfort movie 😋
Mulan is my comfort movie. "Reflection" is a gay anthem, change my mind.

I have been planning on running to the woods this past week in a very similar way to this video so I definitely took notes for my adventure tomorrow 🥰
GARRETT! My old, broken, soulless body needed your wholesomeness today ❤
Garrets most recent search history really did be "google"
Ratatouille is definitely my comfort movie and my all time favorite movie
I just wanna say it is like you found the Forbidden Forest 😍😜 great video Garrett! 😀😀
This is actually a cursed alternate universe version of bo burnham's special and this one is called Outside
Usually trespassing signs in CA at least are due to mountain lion dens or are there for your own protection... be carful next time.
Speaking of the woods, Fantastic Mr Fox is my comfort movie 👍🏻 great vid Garrett love you!!
my comfort movie is True Lies, I don't know why, Jamie Lee Curtis just looks so pretty in it.
hmmm comfort movie... Firewall or Six Days Seven Nights or anything Harrison Ford
Wait is that seed bread the same bread that he showed Andrew when he moved out of his apartment? “You know Vikings……”
LMAO...Why do I keep replaying the "tree" falling on Garrett?! Such great editing!
My comfort movie is definitely nightmare before Christmas 😭
Okay firstly my comfort movie is Charlie and the chocolate factory by Tim Burton and secondly, garrett I really hope you know that your search history is the most you thing ever, especially the «are lobsters immortal» search🤍
My comfort film is kill bill vol1 I don’t know why but I just love everything about it and especially the scene where she kills the crazy 88s
Thank you for the free month of skillshare! I am going to try and learn how to make a crochet bee!! Then I can have a little bee friend!
My comfort movie is Pan's Labrynth. I know it seems like a weird choice but the cinematography is beautiful.  I'm not a Spanish speaker (studied a few years of Spanish in school) but I have watched it so many times I don't need subtitles anymore.  I can just watch and enjoy a wonderful movie!
YAY GARRETTTTT

adam sandler is my comfort actor
Oh the Teddy Bear is cute, I’m 24 and sleep with a teddy bear and don’t plan to stop 😂 I’m so glad you posted 😌😌 And my comfort movies are all the Harry Potter movies 😂 but I love the half blood prince the most
My comfort movies are Beetlejuice and A Walk To Remember ... Plus EVERYTHING Harry Potter related !!!
No hate just a thought.... Is there secret tea?   Ok I like garret, I like Shane... but why is he coming away with "running away to the woods" "scary theme content" in the middle of Shane's come back I'm interested is this tea because he genuinely didn't address that he had the guts to talk to Shane since ages ago... also .... where did Andrew go ? Did he actually run away ? From the secret drama ... I know this is sus and I want to enjoy the content.. I just hope this isn't a laugh at Shane's series right now and how serious he takes the spooky life he lives unlike garrets relaxed mentally to laugh at what makes him scared and plan why he is there and everything that happens before hand
My comfort movie(s) are Coraline, Halloween town, Nightmare before christmas, and the little mermaid + tangled
Moonstruck and Hudson Hawk ;)
<3 <3 <3 glad to see you again Garrett!!  Thanks for the video!
My comfort movie is The Polar Express
My favorite movie that I guess is my comfort movie too is Studio Ghibli’s Howl’s Moving Castle. The book is different and an absolute blast too if you haven’t read the original.
My comfort movie is either Pride and Prejudice (the newer one) or the Twilight movies 🥲 Edit: NOOO ITS ELLA ENCHANTED
YESSS IM SO EXCITED

Witchcraft practitioner here, or witch, if you place the broom stick with the bristles facing up, it symbolizes protection and cinnamon has many magical properties as well. Hope this helps and I hope you and your family are well. Best wishes and thank you for the journey of this video 🌻✨  ~{p.s. Wands are also actually used in witchcraft and magical practices. It can add emphasis and even more intuition and energy to your practices, but it is definitely not needed. Hope this helps magical friend ~^-^~}~
The fact that the Boy Scouts handbook was on the shelf of dead things 🤭
You should do a video with Fowler's makery and mischief. Then you can live your dreams of being in the woods but also do it in the right way lol

Naked and afraid except Garrett is fully clothed and not on an island
The way I could forsee just how badly it all would end the moment I read the title alone..., lmao. I am glad you didn't die, Garrett! Or get arrested. And also glad lil' spider buddy got a nice burial. May himb RIP. 🕷️✨   My comfort movie (surprisingly, but not really) is "The Collector", which is a slasher/horror movie lol. I love horror films and spooky stuff ig, so it makes sense to me. Idk, it's just one of my latests hyperfixations and I love to watch it and chill and forget about the failure I am irl. ✌🏼
“are lobsters immortal” hahahaha
This video was so funny I missed your vids so much! My comfort film is “Just Wright” with Queen Latifah… idk why it’s just so sweet and good and it brings me joy.

hate to admit this but my comfort movie is the twilight saga. i watch the whole saga probably once a year when i’m at my lowest and it makes me even sadder and i don’t know why but it just brings me back to little 6 year old me watching it with my mum. #teamedward
UPDATE after finishing the video I need to validate Garret’s comfort movie. 50 firsts dates is an amazing comfort movie, it’s mine. In fact I spent my 20th birthday watching it with my mom. Wouldn’t have it any other way

Yay! All i saw was Garrett Watts uploaded new video and i clicked immediately😀fav thing about my day is when you upload a new video. My day was bad but just got better ty💜 Edit: ok so i realized me and garrett have alot in common and i think if i ever met him we would be good friends. He talks about as much as i do and that's cool because noone wants to be in my life because of how much i like to talk so i just don't anymore except here on yt in the comments. I have quite a few comfort movies girl inturrupted harry potter lord of the rings and i know it's weird but i love horror movies and halloween and scream give me comfort when I'm upset or my depression is worse than ever. I have comfort songs too does anyone else?no just me ok lol youtube also gives me comfort like for instance this video gave me lots of comfort because watching a Garrett Watts video always makes me feel like i have a friend and that I'm not alone. Thank you Garrett for doing what you do. You're one of my fav youtubers. Ok I'm gonna go now. Hope you all have a great weekend.
Garrett, honey, I hope firmly that you cleared the fridge of any food and took it outside and got rid of it.

I have a few comfort movies I rotate through depending on my mood. The first 2 mummy movies  I watch them multiple times a week then all the jurassic park/world movies and then finally the 1998 version of godzilla.
Garrett I can't tell you how much I want to hang out with you. It's a literal life goal. We'll watch all the movies and have all the snacks and trade tiny things!!! 🤣
College? Nah I’ll just follow Garrett into the woods, absolutely genius idea, here I go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!1!1!1!1
Firstly: I too have that Harry Potter castle and I’m convinced the towers like to break and fall off if you look at incorrectly. 2: comfort movies are obviously Harry Potter, The Holiday, and the 1985 version of Anne of Green Gables. Like the 3hour version you find on PBS.
you know what, he may be going crazy, but at least he’s still got that bright spirit
Is today's sponsor ManScape?...You remind me of this Scene/Emo guy I used to know-I kinda miss that era. His hair just got longer and longer till you couldn't see his face anymore. It wasn't bad though. You don't be look bad with long hair. Anyways..no one asked for my opinion.
K-on is my comfort anime, also making rainbow loom bracelets n watching sum good ol garrett is the best thing ever

Why did this give me flashbacks to the story “Into The Wild” ffff- But regardless, such an enjoyable video all the same, wouldnt expect anything less from the Garrett Watts  Comfort movies are definitely gonna have to be Megamind and ironically, 28 Days Later, such classics for me uwu

Rock-a-doodle. Great comfort movie. You sad ? Watch Rock-a-doodle. Angry ? Not if the Evils rouster has anything to be with it. Watch Rock-a-doodle.
My current favorite comfort movie is Palm Springs with Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti. To me it’s the perfect balance of sci-fi and romcom. It just makes you feel all good inside and makes me smile😊
1:08 is my new favorite saying and my biggest comfort movie is wes anderson's fantastic mr. fox ^^ glad i could join you on this adventure and may window spidey rest in peace💕✨
Comfort movie(s): 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist'. And 'Where the Heart Is'.
Anything Brendan Fraser or Keanu Reeves is a comfort movie to me. I always feel cozy watching Blast from the Past or Constantine.
I love you so much Garrett. … You are me, I am you (but with different parts). lol  And honestly, you’re rockin the hair and beard ..just style a teensy bit.

GARRETT UPLOADED WE HAVE BEEN BLESSED
I'm almost 20 and still use my teddy bear I got when I was born, nothing weird about that
You kinda give me "Werewolf Lumberjack" vibes and it looks pretty good on you tbh
Why do you always clickbait us…
At this point blame it on Mercury in retrograde 🥴
Why is Garret's life as chaotic as mine 😂
If your refrigerator stopped working but your freezer is working that means something inside is frozen and you need to thought with a hair dryer my handyman just did this at our rental a month ago
literally living for this rn omg 😭 ❤️
Oh I’ve missed you! 😂❤️
Me too! Me freaking too! (In reference to wanting to run off into the woods)
I watched his haunted video with Andrew earlier today and wanted him to come back. Truly blessed.
My comfort movie would probably be tangled orrrrr the lego Batman movie. OR a comfort “movie” to me is like watching someone play a telltale story game and it’s basically a movie
We must protect this precious soul at all cost.
The amount of joy I feel when I see a new Garrett video in my recommended is unparalleled.
My comfort movie is nick and Norah's Infinite playlist haha

Ugh. Just when I've had a crap day, Garrett bestows this glorious video upon us 😍😍. Missed youuuuuu and I'm ready for some cowboy chili night vids 🥺

My comfort movie is definitely Howls Moving Castle- we never bought the movie, but we've had it recorded on our DVR for as long as I can remember, ready to be revisited at any time.
Ooh probably any movie with Adam Sandler and any animated Disney movie being honest
Gotta love that life lesson, i'll keep that in mind ☝️
Garrett is our best boy and we love when he uploads!!! (And when he doesnt)
Omg, you posted!! Can't wait to watch!
My comfort movies are Zootpia, Scott Pilgrim vs the world, and Hocus Pocus.
Agnostic is like the religious fence sitter
uh... why is there a tea cup at 4:55 O_o... ?  and also... it's Rapunzel (✿◕‿◕✿) can watch it literally anytime of the day!
garret, i think all that happened is because mercury is in retrograde..
you're doing great sweetie!!!
Ya look FAB! Beard gives that rustic feel you need when living in the woods:D..Love ya necklace as well..again ya look fab. Stay safe and  chaotic <3
GARRETT YOU LOOK JUST LIKE ZEKE FROM ATTACK ON TITAN!! also my comfort movies are Shrek(all of them), The Incredibles(both of them), and the Spongebob Movie (the one with giant David Hasselhoff)
Why so sexy? My caveman? 😍🖤

Honestly every time Garrett uploads it makes me 10 times happier
Honestly Interview with a Vampire or Bound as awkward as that is are my comfort movies.

7:32 "Are lobsters immortal" Garrett really out here asking the real questions

5 minutes within the video and a few thoughts I already have is 👀: 1. I really like how Garret looks 😍 2. There are things I relate to & things I just learned I relate to & I don't know if I should be concerned or not 😐🤦🏻‍♀️. 3. I think Garrett is slowly turning into my spirit animal 😆.
Just in case nature isn't ✨the vibe✨
The shirt your wearing in intro makes you look like lumber jack

Love you Garrett... You make me laugh and WE LOVE YOU!! You’re my comfort movie lol
YESSS I missed u
The whole video I was like: "Oh no..." but I'm glad you experienced the woods even if it was just for a little while '^ ^   Also, my comfort movie would be Legally Blonde (the first one). Idk why, but it's always been my go-to when I'm sick or feeling down <3

Grand Budapest hotel is my comfort movie
✨The king has come home✨
I love that instead of watching a skillshare video on how to fix his fridge, he went "ehh screw it, I'm just going to run into the woods and watch how to not die to do that"
Garrett is literally in his Bo Burnham era
This might sound weird but I think about you a lot in this month of October, spooky boy. Also I revisit sweet boys podcast episode #20 to watch that tubular improv rap situation every now and then, honestly that whole episode was my fav and brings me so much joy lol 🤪  Oh oh and my fav comfort movies are the Lord of the Rings 🥰
My comfort movie is by far Howl's moving Castle
My comfort movies are literally all of the monster high movies, I could watch them 100 times and still love them

Comfort movie surprisingly is Jaws 3 for me or Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Always resort to those. Miss your videos and podcasts i was so happy to see this posted when I came home from work today!
Garrett i was just thinking about you, im so happy you have uploaded!
Garrett is in his “Bo Burnham’s Inside” era
My answer is so basic, but my comfort movie would be anything with Robin Williams and yes even One Hour Photo. 🤣
My comfort movie is the movie adaptation of Godspell, as odd as that is! The music, the setting, the costumes, the 70s aesthetic, everything! I’m not even Christian, I just love it so much and I highly recommend it, it’s so chaotic but beautiful
It's like a ray of sunshine on a dark stormy day when Garrett uploads and I can here that super cute laugh
Garret? No. Bo Burnham.. maybe
im so sorry so much has been going wrong for u Garrett but im also glad were both struggling and ur be able to make my dreams come true of just running away to live in the forrest 💖 (making this comment only a few mins in so might comment again haha)
if i’m allowed to consider bo burnham’s inside as my comfort movie then... that. but other than that i think maybe the breakfast club!  so nice to see another video too :’)
My comfort movie is scream!
My comfort movie is The Lovely Bones. I know it's sad and terrifying, but in the end everything turns out fairly okay. Just like life.
Labyrinth is my comfort film, I grew up watching it with my mum so it hits the nostalgia feels
Garrett is either living in grace or living in despair. And it all depends on what he records for the day.
this video is giving very Ted Kaczynski
hi garrett
50 First Dates is perfect!  I also watch Benchwarmers whenever possible.
Garrett my boy you bring me such joy

thank u for making my day, i miss u Garrett!!!
Adams Family Values will always be a comfort movie
garrets channel is my happy place
50 first dates is one of my tops as well. But number one for me is Just Friends. I laugh so hard in that one. My brother just passed away 2 weeks ago, and we watched that movie all the time. We would quote or fav lines, and make eachother laufh so hard.  Its a must watch!!!!!!!
My comfort movie is The Boys in the Band, it goes pretty deep but the atmosphere is very chill and the movie is entertaining all the way through. It’s on Netflix :D
Don’t ask me why but Freedom Writers Diary is weirdly a comfort movie, sumn about it just makes me feel hopeful at the end idk
Idk that I have a comfort movie but I've got some shows. Like the Witcher, any competition show where they make things like blown away or forged in fire, car restoration shows, and anything from HGTV
This was hilarious and silly and I'm here for it! Thank you soooo much.   My comfort movie is StarWars: The Force Awakens.
must be a no bones day for garret
♡
To answer your question: I think Finding Nemo is one of my biggest comfort movies <3
Ok dont laugh but my comfort movies are those 80's Care Bear's movies. Only 1 and 2. I haven't seen those movies in forever I should really rewatch them. I would play those movies over and over as kid. Then my sister stole them for her kids and the kids broke the cds. Oh and barbie princess and the pauper? Only because of Preminger. He's the only character that matters to me in that movie. And the cat that barks. I dont watch a lot of movies. I AM A MAN.
I would love a whole dedicated show about Garret's life while living in the woods, I would actually watch that
Take advice from your Garrett loving mechanic... take your catalytic converter and sell it before someone else can. 😌
My latest comfort film is The Gentlemen because the music is such a vibe and Charlie Hunnam looks hot in a cardigan. :)
okay my favorite comfort movie is probably Spirited Away, Ponyo, or Howls Moving Castle.... i can't pick
garrett i missed you sm :(( <33
Oh man, my mom had her converter stolen off her car too awhile back. Was a total pain to replace. They really are insanely valuable in the chop shops
i cant ever tell if the "ill make fun of myself before anyone else gets to do it" bit is a.. _bit_ , or not, but I think garrett looks like a lovely lumberjack who would help me find my way back home very kindly if I were to get lost in the woods. we love you garrett ❤ also I'm so sorry all this stuff has happened at once, if it were me id freeze up and cry myself into a three week nap 😭 im glad hes turned it into an opportunity rather than an obstacle :)
Comfort movies: Jurassic World and the Bee Movie 😂😂😂
I love you're facial hair Garett! It looks good on you.!
Boyfriend. You look amazing like always. I miss you. Lol
my comfort movie i think is spider-man 2
I'm trying to remember if there's always a slight tinge of "in extreme distress" in many of his laughs and I think "Distressed" if Garrett's entire aesthetic XD hahaha
i feel like a worried mother this whole video GARRET THIS WAS ACTUALLY SO SCARY JUST GO CAMPING WITH ANDREW NEXT TIME  also! my comfort movie is tangled, phineas and verb across the second dimension, and any of the pokémon movies  OH WAIT SORRY I KEEP EDITING THIS BUT THE ANIME MOVIE “WORDS BUBBLE UP LIKE SODA POP” it’s so cute if you haven’t seen it!!
OKAY SO my comfort movie is “The Jungle Bunch” (the original one) It’s like some old movie and a few months ago I actually bought it off some thing called Vudu. SMALL VENT WARNING! When I was younger and had lived in a homeless shelter because I didn’t turn out to be very fortunate- I had a dvd player (which can I say was very old and barley worked ofc bc it was way after ppl stopped using them) and the only movie I had was The Jungle Bunch because I couldn’t get a phone. It was just some random drug store movie that they had in the back, BUT I LOVED IT. It’s only been 4 months since I bought it and I’ve watched it WAYYY TOO MANY TIMES!   ANYWAYSSS please say safe man! Your videos are really fun to watch and I’m glad nothing really bad happen in those woods 😅
A new video a blessing never a curse from Garrett
my comfort movie is ferris buellers day off. it’s my favorite movie and i can quote the whole thing. makes me feel like everything will be ok. 💙
Yup
I took the car part hehe 😌
You couldn't have posted  on a better day, I needed this so much!
50 First Dates is one of my main comfort movies too, but I would also count Holes, the first two Kung Fu Panda movies, the first and third Cars movies, Megamind, The Road to El Dorado, and (unfortunately) Zootopia 😔. (National Treasure and The Mummy when I'm sick tho lmao)
i am only happy on days garrett uploads
WE’VE BEEN BLESSED
My comfort movies: Spirited Away Princess Mononoki The Reader Fight Club
My comfort movie is either rent or nightmare before Christmas
Paranorman, Elizabeth Town, Big Fish, um...Beetle Juice, I know I have a few more but that's what I can think of right now. Haha We have missed you! When is the podcast coming back?
Garrett, you look AMAZING with that beard and your long hair. The whole Bo Burnham/Captain America vibe suits you a lot. Keep thriving, you are doing amazing, sweetie! ✨
Come to big cottonwood creek.
Better than any video Shane has ever put out!!
weirdly enough, knives out is a big comfort movie of mine! or age of ultron😎
YES!! This must be why today was a bones day!
Dude is fucking crazy . Lol
I left listening to a Sweet boys podcast to watch this. So excited to see what you’ve created!
This came at the perfect time. Just woke up from a dream that had me walking around the house crying for a few minutes. Turned to youtube to cheer myself up and there's Garrett, the perfect cheerer upper ❤️ my comfort movies are the first Captain America movie and The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou
My Comfort movie is clueless !!!  <3
I have a feeling that this is the turning point for him, and like in 30 years he’ll be on tv for either being in a movie or stabbing someone with a Harry Potter wand
That falling tree scared the shit outta me 😂
I think my comfort movies are: Thumbelina, Anastasia, Shrek the Musical, and any old Barbie movie from before 2008
love this blair witch project sequel
My comfort movie is Roman Holiday with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck. It’s such a sweet movie and the ending hits me right in the feels :’)
My comfort movie isn’t a movie but it’s the pride and prejudice mini series…
Garrett, A National Treasure ™ Also I have a whole list of comfort movies on letterboxd under Laurell. My all time fav is Benchwarmers.
my comfort movie is john carpenter’s the thing i love it so much and could watch it forever
tv show but leverage, cuz I remember watching with my friends when we were way too young to be watching it but I genuinely believe I shaped who I would become today.
I really didn't have a comfort movie until recently the Muppets Haunted Mansion movie came out, it's my favorite plus I'm just a really big fan of the Haunted Mansion and the lore around it~ 👻
The fact that Garrett kept a dead bathroom spider in a little coffin for who knows how long and buried it in the woods is the sweetest and most random thing I've ever seen.
any studio ghibli movie just gives me comfort in the weirdest way
Ok.. Spirited away was a prime choice! I think my neighbor totoro is my comfort movie though.. The original ghibli studio one.. Not the BS Disney remastered one. Almost ALL original ghibli studio movies are bomb. I have been watching totoro since I was 10 and now my 3 year old loves it too! Love you garrett, happy you made it to taco bell and home safely! Hope the ouch on your head healed fast.. If you want, ill go find that tree and kick its ass..
The king of the woods is back  god I love u  Garrett  you like my long lost older brother that Is a big Harry Potter nerd just like me
comfort movies: coraline, howls moving castle, a silent voice and probably the nightmare before christmas! also i love you so much take care of yourself <33
My day is immediately better. Thank you for existing Mr. Watts
We have been blessed! I NEEDED this video today!! Thank you Garrett!! My favorite comfort movie is The Princess Bride!! Love your fellow Hufflepuff💜
Comfort movies: Dead Poets Society, Sleepless in Seattle, Incredibles, and Friends Season 1 Episode 4! :)
Ok hear me out, what if it wasn’t a sign to go into the woods but instead it’s ghosts trying to get you to leave your house?
My comfort movie is any of the Jurassic Park movies, or any of the Harry Potter movies (my last name is Potter, so obvi I love them), and any Disney/Pixar/DreamWorks/Paramount animated movie. Oh and Shrek the Musical
Comfort movie would be any romantic comedy
My comfort movie is Fried Green Tomatoes. 🍅
Is it sad Garrett uploading has made my super crappy existence better?
My comfort movie is three amigos  c:  It’s old but it reminds me of my family and how much I’m loved. Oorrr like anything scooby doo puts me to sleep  OR the Great Gatsby even though it can be sad I think it’s nice to see another hopeless romantic <3
Blast from the past is my comfort movie. :)
my comfort movie is brave! I love the soundtrack and it just makes me feel so warm and cosy for some reason, I don't know but I love it so much <33
I saw your samurai sword. I have a replica of Bill's sword from Kill Bill and David Carradine autographed it!
Nothing better than a Garret video! Hope we get some spooky stuff for Halloween!
My comfort movie is Scooby-doo and the Alien Invaders. Love the video!❤
my days r so good when garrett uploads
My comfort movie has to be Halloween town!! 🎃🌙🍂 love your videos Garrett!!!!
Sorry, I had to pause this and go see how cinnamon brooms are made 💀😂
To answer your question, my comfort movie is the nightmare before Christmas
I love watching Garrett i feel so happy that he posted❤❤❤ I dont have a comfort movie i have a comfort show tho which is criminal minds😊
My comfort movie is Alice in Wonderland. SPECIFICALLY the 1951 animated Disney classic 👁. I have it memorized from how many times I’ve seen it, the childish wonder of it reminds me that I was once a curious tiny human and that I am not a larger curious human
my comfort movies include Moulin Rouge, Matilda, Velvet Goldmine, Rocky Horror, and Chungking Express! I would say some classic barbie movies too but now I just cry missing childhood watching them lmao
I needed this after a dreadfully long exam huhu thank youuu QwQ
Wow, I have a daddy long legs I brush my teeth with every morning, as yet he hasn’t passed :) Where can I buy this coffin should the worse happen :/
Garrett is the reason I watched Charlie's angels and now I love it!!!
Garrett uploading solves at least 3.2 of my problems, and my comfort movie is Paul Blart mall cop lol
You pulled out the discolored box that is now green and I knew exactly what it was 😂 my wand box looks the same
ngl Garrett do be lookin like a snacc with that beard 👀 👀 👀 (i say this respectfully sir)
My comfort movie is Anastasia - the songs, characters, just brings me so much joy 🖤
Did this possibly all happen within Mercury retrograde? It’s been wild.
Coraline and Nightmare Before Christmas are my favorite comfort movies. Just so nice to watch
Comfort movie… Clue. Always has been Clue 🕵️‍♀️  Mrs. Peacock was a man?! 👋
My comfort movie has to be The Hunger Games. That might seem a little strange but it reminds me so much of my childhood because when I was eleven/twelve my parents finally let me watch it and read the books. After that, I was so obsessed with it and would watch one of the movies every day 😭
Ok Garrett can't tell you enough- your content never fails to at least make me smile. Thank you bud:D
I think my comfort movie is practical magic :) very happy you popped up in my notifs <3
he actually turned into a dollar store bo burnham 27:41
Life was giving you a sign to film and post again
The hunger games ....
I took the biggest L today at work but I saw that Garrett posted a new video so now it’s a great day 😌
My comfort movie is Back to the Future
Mountain man Garrett 🥵🔥 loving your Necklace btw 🧡 Glad you're back
Ummm. My comfort movie is Crossroads with Britney Spears 🙈🙈🙈
Charlie and the Chocolate factory has been my comfort movie since i was a kid. i've seen it hundreds of times cause i just put it on whenever I'm sad
I love how Garrett's videos give me whiplash.
“People can’t say mean things about you if you beat them to it … FIRST”   BEEN using this life hack since I was born 🤣🤣🤣😭
when he brings out the whip🤭🙈
Garrett, I think your Burly Man On A Precipis Of Total Destruction Look is handsome & you wear it well😊
Garrett, You look beautiful. Genuinely. From the bottom of my heart.  Don't apologize for your appearance, it's a blessing :)
My comfort movie is the 2004 Tom and Jerry movie Blast Off To Mars Probably my most watched DVD when I was a kid after The Incredibles
Grownups 1 & 2, Guardians of the galaxy vol. 1 & 2.
This was everything I needed today
a new video from garrett is truly a blessing and experience
Sorry for a 3rd comment but my comfort movie is Stand By Me :)))
It's a really weird thing, but my favorite comfort movie is the first Jurassic Park, BUT it has to be raining and foggy outside to reach maximum comfort levels. Have no idea why, but the weather adds to the comfiness I guess??
My confort movie ils Ferrys Buller’s day off!
I have a hedgehog in my garden and I’ve been spending more time outside at night, so I 100% relate.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW CLEAN THAT TREE FALLING EDIT WAS? I saw it out of the corner of my eye and had to watch it again to be sure a tree didn't actually fall on your ass
Garret's madness is so refrehsing and heartwarming. His vids always make my day.
Your videos give me life! Absolutely awesome! 😂😊
Garret: Uploads Me: Gets snacks and gets comfy
My comfort movie is Thor Ragnarok
My comfort movie/s are Harry Potter because,,, magic yes please, any pirate movie also the second matrix so yeah, have a great day!
It’s a series but my comfort movie is Mr Robot lmao
When is the Taco Bell song going to drop on Spotify?😂
People are stealing catalytic converters everywhere unfortunately. It’s horrible.
also thank god garret is back
i have a few comfort movies!! Either prisoner of Azkaban, philosophers stone, the perks of being a wallflower, the edge of seventeen, dirty dancing and 10 things I hate about you. they're so good I could rewatch them over and over. This video was so good always a good day when u upload. hope your doing okay! glad u didn't get eaten by a bear :))
When you're burnt out on a Friday but then Garrett uploads and you immediately feel the weight lifted from your shoulders
Dude , you should be doing constant content . Your very entertaining. BTW it is Halloween season.
my comfort movie would definitely be awake the 2008 movie about anesthesia 🔪
when  I first look at you when the vid started I was like "he looks like if you bought inside bo burnham on wish"
my comfort movie is kiki's delivery service <3
“I’ll just die and see what happens…LOL 😜” 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 😂😭
Comfort movie! Probably vanilla sky, the Italian job, first wives club, nice guys, and tekkinkinkreet? They’re not particularly all feel good but they help me feel stoked 😂  Also as a person living in Arkansas where you can be VERY in the woods after a 20m drive: I LOVE the woods but I am ALSO always scared 😂 THERE ARE THE WEIRDEST SOUNDS IN THE WOODS— a friend of mine said  “oh that’s just all the creaky critters” so maybe that’ll help you!
i literally bought corpse bride again this week because i have no tv that works with a dvd player, not that i know where i’ve put my dvd copy of it, and it’s not on any streaming sites… so i’d say my comfort film is corpse bride 😂 (there’s also several marvel and disney movies but depending on the day sometimes they leave me in tears instead of comfort)
I WAS JUST HOPING YOUD POST YES
the Blair witch project looks different here, must be a directors cut or something
i think my comfort movie would be The Last Jedi or A New Hope!!!! bestie do you have a fav star wars movie?
Oh my god the way he said “ouch” when the sword fell on him at 10:00 was iconic
Cowboy Bebop is elite 🥰
I've been this Garrett
Two comfort movies I love are A Cinderella Story with Hillary Duff or What A Girl Wants with Amanda Bynes
My comfort movie is the lego Batman movie probably one of my top 10 movies 😭
My comfort movie is The Iron Giant... I might cry every time I watch it, but sometimes a good cry is comforting
With every new video Garrett uploads I find myself worrying more if he's okay.... He's probably not okay tbh. Lol
I keep saying Garrett is like a ray of sunshine and no one can prove me wrong. So happy for bathroom window spider! As for the movies! Honestly, Evolution and First Wives Club! Those are both great! (Plus, Evolution has Mulder from X-Files so it just makes it better lmao)
there is no notification that makes me happier than this :')
Wow what an ending to an excellent week of YouTube content.
Stardust is my number 1 comfort movie for sure .... especially with the take that song rule the world at the end just pure bliss xx
my comfort movies are somehow midsommar and the santa clause 1 2 and 3
I love your hair and beard! You look amazingly rugged and sexy.
Ella Enchanted. Don't care what's happening, I'll watch it.
I don’t think you realize it Garret, but no matter what happens.. I want to hear from you!
My comfort movies are Pirates of the Caribbean and Bolt <3
im on day 5 of doing the same thing, it is so refreshing. im in a small cottage alone by myself. Ive already cried like 5 times but its so therapeutic lol
your question was kinda hard but honestly im just going with the first movie that comes to mind which is: The Boys In The Band, i honestly think the world of it, i think all the actors are so cool! and you should go watch it asap on netflix!
I'd say my confort movies are 'Tangled' and 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'! True masterpieces. Also I hope you're doing well Garrett! Loved this video!!:)<3
Comfort movie: Shrek 😁
RIP windowsill spider.
my comfort movie is The Nightmare Before Christmas :D
Nothing to do with the video but garrett kinda looks like zeke from AOT

I just started listening to sweet boys again this morning and then I was so happy to see this video today thank you Garrett for making my day! Also my comfort movie is Coralline I have it on all the time before bed
Garrett..sweetie...you never fail to suprise me  Also, my comfort movie is clueless
Garrett called the ground ‘the floor’.... we must protect him at ALL COST
My neighborhood has a huge issue with the catalytic converter theft. They  actually have full on chop shops that do this  shit...a coworker of mine has had hers stolen 3 times from work.
This was the quickest half an hour 🙁🙁🙁
How defuk i still alive in tose conditions, un actually impress and proud. I wish to se you next adventure
My comfort movie is probably Coraline. Idk why, but a movie about a spoopy unsafe child, makes me feel happy and safe. Also Barney and the Rainbow Egg but I think that's more for nostalgia reasons.
We all love our adult teddy bears :) keeps the bad dreams away!
If Garrett responded it would make spooky month even better. I love ur videos
Looking like grizzly Adam's in a good way:)
That necklace though.. 😲
GARRETT. 😭💜
Im so sick right now this single handedly cured me and my flu
My comfort movies; 1. Anything ghibli (specifically Kiki, howl, & nausicaa) 2. A Cinderella story with Hillary duff 3. Scott pilgrim vs the world

You always take the weirdest shi't with you. 😂
my comfort movie is either sing or the greatest showman idk why but their so good
The Princess Bride
i think my comfort movies are probably Luca or Ponyo. Descendants 2 is also pretty good. I really like the music and the pirate crew.
my comfort movie is The Goofy Movie. it hugs my little 90’s heart and if you don’t do the perfect cast every time you’re on a dance floor THINK AGAIN
my comfort movie is megamind
Wait a minute, the women that talk shit about her kids while cuts your hair, sounds familiar...Donna?
Nothing makes me happier than to see your name pop up on my notifications.

My comfort movie is Howl’s Moving Castle
QOTD I think my main comfort movie is Treasure Planet, or how to train your dragon.
Already cried so much today but now I can just smile:)
GARRET PLEASE BE CAREFUL IN THE WOODS
I work in the tech industry so to disconnect after my last project I did go camping by myself. It's a great disconnect but only if you go prepared. Also if you haven't camped before try to go with friends the first time. It'll be a lot more fun and less scary. (I also highly recommend an actual tent and sleeping bag if you try again)
Forget a movie, my comfort show is avatar the last air bender it’s a cinematic masterpiece and I have watched it at least 8 times through probably more to be honest. That or Captain America Winter Soldier nuff said
Comfort movie is Moana
*It's Garrett being an Erykah Badu fan for me*
the spy who dumped me is my comfort movie becuase WHO DOES LOVE KATE MCKINNON
my comfort movies are cars and coraline, watching them makes me feel safe :’) btw missed you sm garrett, thanks for making my day better <33

His warning about looking horrible was so funny cause I thought he looked completely fine lol! ... or ya know... Fiiiiiiiiine...

My comfort movies are Moulin Rouge, Sweeney Todd, Across The Universe and Coraline 😅

You never look terrible. Stop that shit.
My comfort movies are spirited away, coraline, midsommar and 5 feet apart <3
Next video sponsored by filler shave club!
Brad Leone WHO
RIP window spider
But like does any1 else wonder how does garret make most of his income? Does he have a day job or do these once every four month uploads support him?
My comfort movie is the benchwarmers 😂
Harry Potter will always be my comfort movies
црн ы ьн лунищфкв кгыышфт
It must be my lucky day Garrett posted🤮
My comfort movie is for sure prisoner of Azkaban or the Lion the witch and the wardrobe
Drew, Shane, Safiya and now Garrett?!? What an awesome week!
I have a comfort TV show instead of a movie. I always put on the office. <3
my comfort movie/sleeping movie is A Knights Tale,, ever since i was little that has always been a really chill movie that i have seen a hundred times but still get happiness out of  i love you garrett, and i hope everyone is having a good day ❤️
My number one comfort movie the the Labyrinth. Sure I was not even close to being born when it came out. My mom was four years old when it did come out but she loved it and raised me on it. David Bowie is my number one inspiration and I see him as a father figure because he basically raised me. Anyways loved the video and I’ve thought about running away to the woods too so you’re not alone.
You should get the ikea bear it’s excellent 10/10
Cry baby is my comfort movie. 🥰🥰
I can always sit down and watch Wreck it Ralph. I saw it several times in one day during school and I enjoyed every minute of it.
Really needed this video! Silly & entertaining. Loved it 💙
Garrett is doing what we're all too scared to do. Going outside.
I’m so mad I’m going out rn I want to watch this 😩
I can totally relate to this, I also want to run to the forest and live there. But I am afraid ill die like Leo dicaprio on that movie with the bear. oh wait no that is not the one... the one where the guy dies trapped in a island in a canadia river (yeah i meant to say that) but i don't know if that is actually a leo movie tho.
My comfort movie is Zodiac (2007) 🙈 Also, totally needed a Garrett video right now!! 💙
“I can’t with all these poles” me when I’m with my very Polish family 🤣
This is random maybe I'm just paranoid but wht the hell Is behind Garrett in 25:41
The Princess Diaries movies and Pride & Prejudice are my forever comfort movies. Love them, always have. I can quote them beginning to end and they always make me feel better. Also the pile of bones on the side of the road… what the heck?
My comfort move is undoubtedly adums family values i love the first on tow but family values just hits different
what's wrong with room temperature grapes? I feel insulted
AHHHHH!!!! He’s back!
If I saw you in the woods at night I genuinely be scared 😭
Me after any minor inconvenience
Oh I'm early
Yay spooky season videooo🦇
Coco is myyyyy comfort movie
I’m scared too 😣
love that garrett definitely can afford a more luxurious vehicle yet decides to stick with his Prius
garrett u look extra hot in this video

Dude...I've been trying to find out wtf my religion is for the past year and omg agnostic describes me perfectly thank you smmmmmmmm
Only Berries (room temperature) no Cream, no fridge
welcome back garrett 😊 my comfort film is labyrinth 😁
So good to see you back Garrett! I hope you and Andrew are well!
I was watching his hospital video(finished it), wanted more, and as soon as I was gonna skim through his old videos…. Look what we have here.
Thank you Garrett! I think sometimes we all just want to run and live in the forrest. I cant because, ya know, kids, so its great to live through you for 20 minutes. Love you!
My catalytic converter was also stolen in the past year! *the worst*
I’ve been waiting everyday looking to see if Garrett has posted a new video and the day has come 😭❤️
I’m always so happy when you upload
Going to the Woods List: ❌ Flashlight ✅Bear Suit for Skeleton
there is 10 minutes left to this video and he’s only just gotten to the woods. somehow i don’t see this video ending how it was supposed to 😭
27:29 spotify version asap 💳💥💳💥💥💳💥💥💥💳
Garrett is an icon for this
Omg Garrett likes anime?!!!   Yussss!!!💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
garrett literally looks like he gives 10/10 hugs
**holds Garrett gently**
I love how his hair becomes crazier as the video progresses.
Garretts editing is next level. Him getting hit by the truck in the last one, the tree in this one. It always gets me!
i have a phobia of the forest so let's see how far i can make it into this video, its all for you Garrett!
So this is Bo Burnham’s ”Outside”
horton hears a who is the comfort movie of all comfort movies imo
Nobody: Everything garret owns: ☠️
If anyone deserves an earthship in big bear it’s our friend Mr.Watts
It’s insane that the catalytic whatever parts are stolen so much now, it’s an epidemic here where I live as well, apprently it’s all over the world! Insane! Wonder what’s caused the sudden spike
22:15
Imagine Garrett is cursed bc he visited st Ignatius could explain all the misfortunes
18:05 teared up at how relatable that felt
Loving the new blaire witch project reboot😍😍😍
The world: *chaos ensues*   Garrett: FUCK THIS!!
That trailer has Kill Bill vibes, so of course it grabbed your attention. 😀
Not that tree edit scaring me...
hell yeah! it's Garrett Time
Garrett is the definition of impulsive lol
rip spider. you will be missed :(
It’s okay to have consistent housing, Garrett. We believe in you.
You don’t look bad You kinda look like a father A new father Also my comfort movies are monster high movies(all of them) And strawberry shortcake berry fairy tales
I am so excited!!! I love the taco bell song lmao
can we talk about how sweet Garrett was when he was putting in his taco bell order? we love a polite king 💛
You are so awesome 😍
Garrett is in his goblet of fire era - the one where no one got a haircut
Its the way that I've been in such a bad place and Garrett knew I needed to live vicariously through him. Thank you
A fun lil spiritual reason for when you find animal bones on your journey means theirs a sign of rebirth in your life 🤍
No please don’t disappear garret we all love you even without a phone
your spontaneity and chaos worries but also entertains me 😂
I always wanted to live in the woods as a kid.
I could have chosen any famous person in the entire world to use for a stencil I’m making for an art piece for my gcse art, and I chose Garrett. I couldn’t be happier.
fucking hell he dose waffle on hahahah
My comfort movie changes every few years. For a while it was pulp fiction then it was fight club then it was infinity war. But right now it’s actually the tv show how I met your mother.
garrett is giving me flamboyant early inside bo burnham vibes with his look :3
you ok bud??
Oh hi Garrett:)
garrett i hope that you're fine now with all those small injuries. i'm so so happy you uploaded! i swear it made my day <3
If someone asks to describe Garrett, just show them this video. Thanks for making a terrible week so much better.♥️ My comfort movie is Stand By Me.
This reminds me of the Office episode where Dwight dropped Michael off in the wilderness. It looks exactly like this. Don't eat the mushrooms!
Thanks for being you Garrett UwU
I've never seen you and thought you look terrible. Every time I've seen you I thought you're adorable and look really lovable ❤️❤️
HI GARRETT!!!!!!!!!
22:23 neither do i ✋😔
It is October and Garrett has reemerged to bring us happiness and spooks. RIP your Hogwarts 🥲
*casually finds human bones*
Thank you for blessing the Youtube Universe with your bubbly, positive self. Been in a really bad place (all my life, sadly) and have no one I can count on (especially someone I love). I haven't spent time with anyone since before my birthday in July (because everyone is "too busy" . . . 🙁), and adding living in a toxic environment makes it very hard to not completely lose it. Honestly, if it weren't for Youtube letting me watch amazing people like you, I don't know what I'd do.
watching Garrett search the internet the same way i do is validating (1 million distractions and never getting an answer)
Not gonna lie, the tree falling bit scared me *flashbacks to the fake truck hitting him*
Garrett out here looking like the burly lumberjack of my dreams
thank you for giving us content!!! it fills my little rat brain with joy :))
The TREE FALLING EDIT OMGNFJDD
I love the hair and beard. Idk why you’re hating on it 😂 You look amazing Garrett and I’m so glad you POSTED!!!
I have had such an awful time with anxiety and hard life situations. Just seeing you laugh and enjoy life so much just made me smile. Can we be friends? 😂
Hey!! People around my area are on a catalytic converter stealing spree too!! .   I was told it's bc there are precious metals inside them .. sooooooo.. what jerks.
Are you old enough to know who Wolfman jack is?  That's yoooo
Garrett I had a dream last night where you were filming a video on the side of the road and I tried to come over to say hello but you kept running away from me :(
This channel can be described as: a nerdy gay men with ADHD  getting more chaotic every time...And i get inspired by it in a weird way.
I thought the beard was nice
Garrett uploading again so soon is so wonderful 😭 Garrett, you make the best videos on the internet that is a full blown fact if you ever need indie pop to use for free for vids I gotchu (I even have a song that literally went to space👀)
Garret the edits with you being hit are giving me heart palpitations 🤣🤣
It’s been a hot minute since we seen garrett 💙 always love your videos and your humour
Garrett are one with nature because you are one with nature.
the serotonin that COURSED through my body when I saw this notification>>>>
My comfort movie would probably be Clueless. That's one if my favorite movies of all time ♥
this video has truly made me feel an emotion that i have never experienced
More garrett, more garrett, more more more ! 😉
My brother and I got the notification at the same time and we both got so exited!
I was just wondering when you would put up another video! Blessed day!
I think the word you’re looking for is omnist rather than agnostic! Not saying you’re wrong but it’s something to look into if you’re up for it.
A new video? You have made my Friday! 💛💛💛
Not Garrett running into the woods because of certain PEOPLE trying to return on the internet. 👀🤡😂 Much love to this guy and the content he’s putting out! Let’s go on a Halloween ghost hunt! 👻🔥💀
I've always wanted to do this too
I just started med school and I’ve been super stressed so I’ve been rewatching garrett’s videos for some anxiety relief and then he blesses us with this🥺🥺
I like that Garrett’s Bear-crow relies on the bears being polite enough to go “oh, sorry, didn’t mean to intrude on your human murdering and eating activities! I’ll get out of your hair”
garrett you look like a granola man
i needed this
Missed you, Garrett😘
where do you get your skeleton buddies? They are so cute and I need one
Me coming in as if i haven’t been refreshing my yt as soon as I saw his insta story
comfort movie: nightmare before christmas or the parent trap😩 oh wait and sleepless in seattle. 50 first dates is so good to. idk anything that will make me feel more alone🤝
I would love to see Garrett go to Slab City!
GARRET CAME BACK IM SO EXCITED
GARRETT! Thank you! I just finished a difficult test for college and this is the BEST treat for surviving it.
not the bear suit 😂😂😂😂😂
i'm sorry garret i love you with all i've got but that look and running into the woods is giving me Ted Kaczynski
My comfort movie is the anime movie “your name”! I don’t know why, but I really like crying myself to sleep while watching it 🥰
Welcome to October, Garretts time to shine. Hi bestie ✨✨
Whipppppppppet
Matthew gray gubler and garrett in the same room would be a blessing ✨
LUMBERJACK GARRETT
As a bo burnham fan my heart skips a beat when you say his name
I'VE BEEN BINGE WATCHING YOUR VIDEPS I'M SO GLAD YOU POSTED TODAY
✨✨Let me just say I was very stressed about the well-being of this wonderful human being. And please Don’t leave me in this dark cold world with your humor and Infectious smile anymore. Please! And Thank you 😊 ✨✨
IM SO HAPPY TO SEE THE NOTIFICATION FOR THIS 😃😃😃
I’m scared too Garrett
You have no idea how happy these videos make me. My go to for when I’m feeling down! Thank you Garrett!
I WAS JUST ABT TO COMMENt THAT U LOOKED LIKE INSIDE ERA BO- HAHAH
garret I 100% understand your mummy reference. mummy returns will forever be my fav movie 😭😭
Someone call Andrew immediately
Garett is what I needed right now
Everytime Garret uploads i get happy af!
Imagine someone just casually having a night stroll and they see Garrett in a small dinosaur kid tent giggling .
You know it’s gonna be a good day when Garrett uploads😌‼️
beard Garrett is superior
My fav spooky little friend 🖤⚰️👀
Pov: u slowly watch Garrett turn into a lumberjack
Omgoodness!!! These teaser uploads Garret!!! I missed you… I know you see this all the time but i Love your videos & wish you could upload more often. Even twice a month would be b cool. But I get it life is busy and from what I understand doing videos is not so quick and easy.  Is sweet boys coming back? I miss Andrew too!
thank you Garrett! I really needed you right now:’)❤️
A GARRETT UPLOAD⁉️😮‍💨
I love seeing Garrett live through his mountain man era
I was literally eating a bowl of ramen and then quickly tossed it aside for this video.    *worth it*
'Kings dead kidz bop' appearing not once but *twice* in the search history is what I needed today.
OMG YES YOU ARE BACK!!!!
Omnism is the religious belief that all religions are pieces of the same thing. I’m Raëlist(atheistic alien religion), but also Omnistic.   The more you know 🌠
Did you upload because the pug had bones today?
Hiii Garrett I love you your such a wholesome boy😂🖤
Literally just seeing Garrett upload gives me serotonin
yuh
Yayy
So the revenues from this video will cover the costs of a new phone, car repairs, a haircut and a new fridge? Got it! 😂👍
garrett sweetie you look amazing and i mean it 100%. i missed u ❤
PLEASE BRING BACK SWEET BOYS!!!!
Birds of prey, hot fuzz, the first pirates of the Caribbean, and treasure planet are all huge comfort movies for me.
Dang Garrett! Mercury retrograde really messed with you this time. Don't worry, bro. You're not alone. Me and the hubby have had a difficult one too.
garret > shane’s shitty “documentaries”
Oh, I better brace myself for this one😂
Yeah we do that with old cars we get rid of.. they're worth a lot
Garrett is such an absolute joy
14:44 the end of midsommar be like
yess join the agnostic fam
HE HAS RISEN
PSA: After my own catalytic converter was stolen, I learned that if you paint them, their value would drop and less likely to get stolen! PAINT YOUR CONVERTERS FOLKS! (I wanna see a pic of someone painting Garrett's face onto their converters)
"I always fight the urge to go feral and run away into the woods" ah yes, fellow goblin c:
yeah sure somethings telling you to get out by making you unable to leave through losing a part that runs your car
A whip!? I have two reasons sitting in my brain and they are WILDLY uncharacteristic 🧐
Thanks Garrett
Haha that tent lmfao
I feel like I'm never surprised by what Garrett uploads anymore. Creating his dream 90s room? Sure. Ghost hunting? Obviously. Running away from LA to live in the woods? Yeah why not
Grow up. And stop acting like a damn child. It's so annoying.
I just saw the title and I am already hyped!
Someone just stole my husbands catalytic converter from his Prius too 😭😭😭
GARRETT
You might call it a "bear-crow"
FRIDAY MADE.
What a Great Friday :DDDD
made lunch and had nothing to watch until Garrett uploaded :)
seeing garrett stare into my soul talking about how well he handles a whip gives me ✨feelings✨
How are you still alive?
Wow I’m early 🥲
HI GARRETT
Garret u r looking amazingly handsome….which prob doesn’t mean much considering I’m a girl lol….. but I do have good taste & ur looking like a yummy dessert atm 💙
Missed your face!! So happy! thank you for uploading!!! ❤️❤️❤️
emo lumberjack vibes
got the biggest smile on my face when i got this notif 🥰
I'm not sure why, but every time I watch one of Garrett's videos it feels like he's filming his intro and other talky research stuff at like 2:30am after 2 consecutive allnighters.
My god, I don't know hen you filmed this but the beginning of your video if it was while Mercury is in retrograde this is the chaotic energy and frustrating situations I and everyone I talk to is going through it feels like absolute endless very inconvenient situations, dropped my phone in water yesterday to...had that phone for 5 years...
dont die in the woods pls garrett
Not agnostic, it's spiritual
I was having a shitty day and now I am in a pretty good mood 🙂
OMG YAYYY A GARRETT VIDEOO UPLOAD!! Also I love the look, it gives me an adventurous, risk-taking guy vibe in a way?
garrett!!! i've missed you sweet boy!!!
That's what I did.. even got rid of all social media 2 yrs ago just have YouTube to watch vids cuz I dont watch TV
I love your laugh ❤️❤️❤️
Garret ily happy spooky season
hey bestie im earlyy
I would. 10/10 cry if i heard Andrew laughing in the woods, from fear or out of love, im not sure.  Take him next time!!!
Is that really what agnostics mean I feel like that I feel literally like that
I literally love Garrett. the shower parttt😭😭😭
Is the 8ft skeleton single?
Im sorry the knife in the cookies just took me out 🤣
IT'S A BONES DAY AFTER ALL. Hi, Garret. 💕
MY DAY IS BETTER 🖤
I was curious about catalytic converters after your story...first thing that popped up on Dear Google: It should be noted that the Toyota Prius leads the nation in catalytic converter thefts. Car experts say since the Prius is a hybrid, the catalytic converter corrodes less than on other cars, keeping the precious metal coating in better shape.
I knew this day was going to be fantastic. Thanks for making it great Garrett 🌞
IM SO HAPPY TO SEE THIS IN MY NOTIFICATIONS 🥰
I find actual complete joy from watching any video of Garrett's 😌👍
his beard is giving the vibes of the dad character in every horror movie that goes insane- the flannel also sells the look (also you look like my stepdad if he was blond and gay)
I swear Garrett comes legit when we need him most. Savioouurrrr
garrett i hate to break it to you but this is just mercury retrograde for you
Perfect start to the weekend, its been quite a wait from the last upload. Have you turned into Dexter Morgan? 😂
Chaotic and hermit Garrett is what I need in my life right now lmaoo
1:34 You and me man👊😎
Garrett's voice is literally my ADHD/Anxiety in my head.
Woods is better than California (cities) right now. Lol
Is this you having a weird mental breakdown ?? Are you okay baby???😔💜
Welcome back.🐛
All I have to say is that you are an absolute unit for watching and loving Cowboy Bebop because it is one of the best anime classics, and I’m curious on your opinion of the live action Netflix rendition!  *1, 2, 3 let’s jam!*
Bro really getting into his Ted kascynski era💀
I have been going thru a hard time also and getting an adult teddy bear was awesome!!!! I'm glad I'm not the only one LMAO 😂 I needed to feel comfort while living alone and the world was going crazy around me
<3 GARRETT
the prodigal garrett returns for his yearly video🖤🖤
Truly love you Garrett
Thank you Garrett, we need your happy smile right now :)
Sir I’m not even kidding when I say I was watching your old videos and now I’m crying cause you upload every time pennywise comes back.
I just wanna let you know that we love you, Garett! But we love the skeletons squad more ngl🥰😍
This is the best surprise upload ever
Loving your lumberjack arc 😩
And also garrett you need to cleanse … bad luck is happening here..  Sage baby
I think u look cute with this style
Garrett ranting about how he hates his hair...  Me: OMG IT LOOKS SO GOOD 😃❤
Just googles “where are woods” LMAO
GARETTTTTSSSSSSSSS BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
"I'll just die and see what happens lol" yeah that's about right
that boy scout handbook is litterly the same age as me
Garrett woods goblin (I mean this in the best way possible)
And ima say this now... Garrett is for sure gonna get a primal kink if he says in the woods for too long lmao 🤣
You’re always cute but this scruffy lumber Jack look is really doing it for me 👀🤣  On a different note, this is the first time I’ve smiled or laughed all day so thank you 😊❤️
I was really stressing about my work but u helped me ( ◜‿◝ )♡
Hi Garrett! 😍
I've missed you so much ❤💜❤
Are lobsters immortal🤣
My week has been rly bad this made me so happy :,) thank u so much Garrett, I hope u have a great rest of your day
Ugh I love how this went from let’s go find ghost to LETS RUN AWAY INTO THE WOODS 🏃‍♀️
I've missed you soooooo freaking much man you look great!!!!!! Thanks for the awesome video!!!!!! Love you!!!!!!!!!!
I haven’t been able to laugh in a bit because of things going on in my life and this made me laugh through almost the whole thing, he really did come back when we needed him the most
Garrett: "...watching 8 miles..."  Me: "......Pitch Perfect..."
GARRETT! (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤
I wanna touch your hair Garrett. I’m intrigued 😂😵‍💫
I missed you so much Garret!!!!!! I love your knee woods life
“are lobsters immortal”
It’s really nice to see you again 👋🏻
i’m excited for the lumber-jack-living-in-the-middle-of-the-woods arc

I’m excited for when Garrett uploads
Holy cow right when I get home from stress full school (it’s Friday) I see this. Needless to say this will be a good weekend

Garrett talking about trying not to die during this:  Also Garrett: **looking like a lumberjack or sumn**
“So I should be okay” Little does he know
I'M SO EARLY YAY
I was just thinking how I missed Garrett and wanted a  New post from him
What happend with your week is called mercury retrograde bestie (+ a bunch of other planets) 😩
Garrett I'm watching this instead of sleeping because who wouldn't
ive been waiting for this one, TURN IT UP
You honestly have to give yourself more credit Garrett, the work you've put into your videos show. You're doing a great job and I'm personally excited to see what you get up too.
When the world needed him most, he returned!!
it’s a blessed day
Garrett literally made my day everytime i swearrr <3
When we needed him most, the king returned.
this is wonderful news
Adele is back, now Garrett. Oh, happy day!
What happened to the podcast …
the skeleton in the background looks very handsome! does he have a name??
YES! love your spooky videos
YOU HAVE JUST BLESSED THIS FRIDAY FOR ME, GOOD SIR!!!
my comfort movie is rocketman (its also my favorite)
just when I finished watching the haunted hospital video and Garrett casually popping like YES HELLO BESTIE <3
Garret you’re literally hagrid.
would you ever collaborate with watcher (shane and ryan and justin) cause like. that would hold so much power
My day is instantly better
😃😃😃
Honestly I'd volunteer to join you Garrett, I'm reaching that point as well
WHY DID YOU TYPE GOOGLE INTO GOOGLE 😭😭😭
this is such a fun video already
7:34 “are lobsters immortal” LMFAO
I feel it  Garrett is going to be the one to find Brian Laundrie
Shoutout from Sweden!
OmG the Cadillac converter!! I literally just read an article that some steal it for obvious reasons. But other steal it to smoke something called honeycomb found (built up-- I believe) inside this very part. 😳 Now comment section don't judge me 😂 I didn't look too far into it but was shocked. And not surprised being in California myself.
You have made my day!
This is why I live in Washington and NOT NEAR SEATTLE oh my god. It’s really funny how most people who lived here all their lives collectively agree that they hate seattle
Back then he looked in his 20s now he's look like in his 40s
hi garrett!!!!
This is blursed content I signed up for
garrett, im a college students also struggling with the urge to run into the forest and just live in the wilderness help
really missed seeing you on my screen!! hope u r doing alright and can’t wait to watch the rest of this video :))
Is THAT who I mistook for Sasquatch the other day on the trail?
garrett just makes me happy (: thank you garrett
😭
Hi Garrett
I genuinely live in the woods and I often forget that people, you know, exist. 😆
Garrett: I’m taking you with.   Me: Well I’m already deep in the woods soooo... meet ya there!
I'ma make a wish, seeing Garrett upload is a true rare event.
Omg!!! It’s a video!!! Yay!!! Missed you.
Keep the beard
upload schedule is always on point 😉
That's my best friend... ahhhh!!!!!!!
It’s a bones day and there’s a new Garrett  video. Good day!
Are my eyes deceiving me
Garett invited camping
YAY! You’re back!
I love you Garrett for you being you! from the UK ❤️
Pov: Your a 7 year old running away from home again because your mom turned off the wifi
It’s not often I get notifications for Garrett watts YouTube videos... but when I do I click soooo fast!!!
Me I want to move to la all so me it’s expensive and I don’t want to die but la is all so very gay and I’m gay 💅💅💅
HI BESTIE
Damn Garrett can grow a nice beard :)
I don't know if Garrett will read this, but if he does, dude i just want you to know that your videos are amazing and they make me very happy 🤸 have a good day (to Garrett and everyone reading this)
YOUR TIMING IS CRAZY PLS THE POWER JUST WENT OFF IN MY HOUSE YOU’RE THE ONLY ONE I HAVE RIGHT NOW 😭😭😭
Golly gee I miss the uploads. Love ya Garrett

Ahhhh he's back and I loved how he's wearing flanel he reminds me of a nice lumber Jack and my favorite comfort movie is Howls Moving Kingdom and the series Bee and Puppycat.  And I'm glad to see you upload and go on an adventure! I hope you do good and take care of yourself!! :]
I INSTANTLY STOPPED THE VIDEO I WAS WATCHING, SCREAMED TO MY FAMILY "GARRET UPLOADED!!" AND FRANTICALLY SEARCHED ON THE ROKU YOUTUBE APP USING A TINY TV REMOTE, WE ARE EXCITED.
It’s my birthday!! What an amazing gift your given. Have a great weekend Garrett!
🤟🏾
Debo gaming🙌it truly is. I am so happy right now.
Fuckin goals 😭
Nothing else could have saved my day like this🙌🏽🙌🏽
Thanks for posting. Was having a mental breakdown about college so this will help me feel better😊
FINALLY MY BELOVED IS BACK
OMG I’ve been agnostic all this time and I didn’t knew!  Thanks professor Garrett! You’re the best! \^w^/
me when garrett posts  🕺🕺🕺👯‍♀️👯‍♀️👯‍♀️👯‍♀️💃💃💃💃🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️ cuz yk im a fairy sometimes
See you guys in a about a year or 2 😂😂😂
Will to live, extended. 🙌🏻
oh.. well i was thinking you looked really good. 🧔
hi Garrett !!!
For everyone that will wonder why he didn’t pause his phone before it dunked.  You don’t just PAUSE Cowboy Bebop! You must keep watching.
seeing an upload of yours so early really made my day, its been a rough week. thanks Garret! sending lots of love <3
omg yes when i visited LA last month every other car i saw was a prius and it’s crazy to think garrett was a big reason why i got one for myself last year 🗿
Thank you for blooming my happiness everyday 😁🌸
Catalytic converter theft is very common in San Diego rn too :( I know like three people that had theirs stolen recently
I knew it was going to be a good day
❤️❤️❤️❤️
garrett the fact that you were watching cowboy bebop tells me you have immaculate taste
hello friend my comfort movie is tangled
The background looks great!
Hiiii Garrett! Warning! Don’t scream in the woods. Your distant neighbors will think you are Bigfoot, but then when they come to warn you, “hi Mr. Garrett, Bigfoot is in the vicinity,” you can just smile, act coy and innocent and say, “I don’t care,” making them think , “ooooh Mr. Garrett is crazy,” but really you aren’t because you know it was you, but yet you question it because why did you scream to begin with to start this whole debacle .... ooooh. Spooooky.
0:21 Looking good with that beard, Garrett😉
"I'll just die and see what happens.... LOL"  -garrett watts 2021
if you take off your glasses you are jack stauber
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
Every time Garrett uploads it feels like christmas
i was going to do my homework :D

I was literally binge watching all of your videos, being like “man I miss his sweet voice 😔” and then here you are. The magic of manifestation
Garrett’s life is interesting
Omg Garret you look like a lumberjack
😍
IM SO EXCITED TO WATCH THE NEW VIDEO!!! Thanks Garrett for always providing me comfort with your videos :'> They seriously help so so much 💛💛💛 My comfort movies: Spirited Away, Ponyo, and How to Train Your Dragon >:)
babe wake up new garrett watts videos
When I read the title the 'im scared' part, it reminded me when he dressed as Penny-wise and said the same things
Garrett is back! This is going be a good night. Love from Scotland ❤
WOOOOOOOO GARRETT!

I was LITERALLY just craving a garrett upload and BOOM there it is 👏😎      ily garrett <33
