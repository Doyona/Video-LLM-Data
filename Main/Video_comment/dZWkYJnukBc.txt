Back when we were a serious team....
Yoo
Zffdfff🇹🇴🇹🇨
Thank god we were saved from extra time,that was an awful game.
Looks like there run will come to an end when they play Manchester, I would love them Leicester to win and on there day they have players to hurt any team.I just think ole will realise this is probably the only realistic chance of winning a trophy this season and will be to much on the day.But hey it’s the fa cup, juicy tie though can’t wait 👍🇬🇧
James Justin now out for 9 months with an ACL Injury 🙏🙏 was having an amazing season aswell
"0:11" Yea i've been getting paid with 𝗣𝗣𝗢𝗡𝗟𝗖𝗔𝗦𝗛.𝗖 𝗢 𝗠 i'm making over $2093 a week with them!   ਹਰ ਜੰਤਰ ਤੇ ਉਪਲਬਧ ਹੈ
Corner taken quickly, *insert substitute striker here* yes!
Brighton are a solid team, if they had  a decent goal scorer they'd be top half of the table.
Best match of the round! The reason being is because it didn't involve two piss poor teams I.E Everton and spurs.
4:36 not one Brighton player marking any Leicester players
What is that defending
moder and karbownik were both an amazing buy for brighton full of potential
Beautiful header ... made us all happy !
I can't believe this dan brown fella is a professional player
Corner taken quickly, Iheanacho!!!
Brighton didn’t deserve that defeat
Corner taken quickly tielemans with the cross    IHEANACHOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!
Bt sport managing to make the highlights of a 1-0 win 2 minutes long than a 9-0
Corrner taken quicklyyyyyyyyy IHEANACHOOOOOOOO
Walton is sooo bad
Jj injury nooo
Brighton defence gave Iheanacho more space than an astronaut 😂
At least Itchy Nacho scored
I feel like brighton have been the unluckiest team this season. I feel like they deserve to be higher up the table and they should of got a few goals in this game. Also I thought they kept saying Shaqiri🤣
shocking defending from that corner at the end. . got what they deserved.  8 players defending, 2 attacking the area , and the striker isn't picked up by anyone  - utter gash !
Nice to see Under put in a performance. Deserves a few more minutes imo he's got to be our most expensive player by quite a distance too! Shows how good the academy and scouts are working at Leicester.
Literally 10 Brighton players v 2 Leicester players in the box and he still scores. Mad.
Commentator
This comment is awesome!
Corner taking quickly .... IHEANACHOOOOOOOOOOO
as a brighton fan that was disappointing  as someone who put cash on leicester that was disappointing for almost 90 minutes
James Justin fpl owners mudded haha
Tbh this is exactly what Brighton deserve for wearing white shorts with yellow shirts and socks
Leicester are holding it down ngl since they won they’ve maintained the quality
4:18 <---------- *For The Goal*
Well done lads onto Liverpool
wow the IQ on the person who made (bright)on ‘s kits
fix your video quality already. pathetic
them passes from madders were masterclass
Who assisted it?
Im just glad Moder and Karbownik got a chance
I was jumping round my living room when that goal went in and I don’t even support Leicester 😂
Rescues?
Corner taken quickly, **insert substitute striker here**
This reminds me so much of corner taken quickly origi!
Iheanacho said F*ck it it's cold Imma finish this
Why do they always cut out the “all glory to Jesus” celebration?
Why is ienhacho invincible when  it is added time
Brighton must be devastated.
Although it was one of the most boring matches ever (no shots on target the 1st half) I wasn’t surprised when iehnacho scored another late goal
Who’s still watching best match of the round at goodison park
Leicester didn’t deserve that
Happy to see Kelechi score another one 💙🦊
I guess I’m early
Great Future for young Polish talents 💪💪🦵🦵...very young,but already showing some good football 😁😁 Good Luck.
