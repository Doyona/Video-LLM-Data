A day for the Champions to FORGET and a day for the Red Devils to REMEMBER! | Manchester United 2-1 Manchester City | Premier League Highlights
Where is this rashford gone 😢
Sad rashford is gonna get kicked out
wow cant believe it feels like this game was yesterday we were so good. Guess it didnt work out in the end with ETH and hes been gone since last month. Hope we can get back to our best with Amorim
0:33 wild commentary
This made a load of people think Utd were challenging for the league
This will always be the best day of my life
WHAT A WIN FOR UNITED! 💪 | Manchester United 2-1 Manchester City | Premier League Highlights
United just beat 115 in the FA cup final!!!!
No way Mci lost
Crying in 2024
Who loves football
Casemiro and Debruyne and holding hands 😂😂😂😂
Manchester United
No one is talking about Garnacho provided the assist for Rashford?
Messi the goat
Rashford has no bottle
2:11 Nah this guy wanted to kill the linesman💀
2:09 Bruno calm down
UNITED UNITED UNITED
Bro the work from Wan Bissaka was unbelievable between walker I would really say Wan Bissaka Was Man of match
Hoping for a similar result today but I don’t think it will happen but if it does I hope it’s not through controversy like this game
Another match in tomorrow👀
Best Match Ever
Disgraceful officiating… let’s hope this doesn’t happen again on Sunday!
We bet city❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
No
Looking back at this 8 months later it astonishes me how few comments there are about that first Utd goal. Clearly offside.
MANCHESTER UNITED 🇬🇧👹⚽️💪❤❤❤
Manchester is red
More of this please!
not a man u fan or a man city fan but man city fans are plastic and glory supporters tbh (not starting an argument)
But Man Utd showed that guy levels
The commentator is Man City fan man
Rashford interfered with play so its offside
The roar of the crowd when bruno scores....WOW!
This year is United year the legend of the world
As an lfc fan I truly wanted a draw
to be honest rashford touched it
Next season manchester united will be a massive threat
Is the commentator from Ireland?
much bettter from man u no 7-0  heart break
Double ManCity's score just like City did to us earlier in the season lol
Liverpool 7 Utd 0 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 So what happened here then? If City turn up at the same level as v Madrid in the UCL second leg Etihad drubbing then Utd are in serious trouble IMO  They could absolutely destroy Ten Hags side and are fully focused on that awesome TREBLE INCOMING
If you are rewatching before fa cup final tomorrow, give me a like
Great game remember the atmosphere was spine tingling Utd should have put the game to bed in the first half. Very wasteful in front of goal
How was anyone saying that the City players stopped playing because they thought Rashford was off - actually watch the video and stop living in denial.
Hope Manchester United win fa cup final, simultaneously stopping the treble. Would be unbelievable to witness.  COYR🔴🔴👹👹🏆🏆
0:34 Eriksen will try to resuscitate 💀
Great game and goal from Brighton.   Overall...Brighton deserved the three points.  The work rate / quality City have is mind blowing.
All for nothing hahahhahahahahahahahahhahaha Champions again and again and again!
Everyone speaking about Rushford but can we appreciate aaron wan bissaka? The difference between this match ant the last derby he played phenomenal, take a bow
Aaron Wan-Bissaka was brilliant this game The difference between this match and the last derby he played
Time to repeat this in the fa cup final
Whos the commentator
second derby against city that I’ve cried in other one again them in the 2:3
7-0
Eriksen will try to resuscitate 💀💀💀
And brilliant defending from fred should been man of match Marcus rashford was😎😎
nuc loves football
Listen to that roar when the second rashford goal hit the net!!!!!!!
Rashford was selfish first half like bro pass the ball its not about if u score its about winning the game
Big change since they 6-3
Why did Luke Shaw change his name, his proper name is Richard Shaw I think Rick Shaw is a much better name
Clever play from rashy
Rashford
it was a close game but i'm so so so so so happy man u won my friend supports man city so i trashed talked him he didn't like it
Typical mancs
The old trafford roar is quite something
I haven't heard Old Trafford roar that loud in a while
First Man U goal was offside.
Best part of the game was the linesman backing away from bruno fearing for his life
Good thing is They kept Haaland quiet
🤣
What a match
This was a good match 👏 👌
Was that the first time Grealish has been seen in the box this season?
Sui
Love the passion in this game
'One player that isnt getting a mention is....' 🤣 Comment section has been through the starting 11...The bench....And the kit man
Arsenal 3-2 Manchester United 😌
VARchester United
Rashfords goal was offside

3000 comments, not one of the so called supporters from Manchester.
Manchester is red and has always been
Go on United
Re watching it there's no way that defender was gonna get to that ball rashford there or not defo not off side
Offside
Eriksen trying to resuscitate, r u joking
And then u drew to palace,haha
Fernandes needs to go
Who’s this commentator, top drawer for the derby!
Clever clever clever
Yo Liverpool are the reds, United are the Red Devils. You'd think SlySports understood this.
How sweet, they're holding hands 01:52 😂😂
Nah.. I’m sorry but Marcus Rashford was involved with two goals today 😅
yeah that was offside
