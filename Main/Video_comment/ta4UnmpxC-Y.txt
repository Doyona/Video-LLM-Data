6:02 the guy in the back in blue is hot 6:02 in my opinion 6:02 😂😂😂

Who is that guy standing in blue ? does anyone know please let me know 😂
Love these kind of videos but their a reminder that I’ll never get to experience something like this bc I don’t have any friends:(
I am Addie and u r gorgeous
I have been watching your guys' videos since I was in middle school and I love you guys!!! To know that you both are married and your family and friends are happy and healthy makes me so happy for you guys! I hope you guys have an amazing life and a happy marriage! ❤❤❤
You need the drinks to get things started and the evening drinks  includes the beer pong .
The guy that brought the balloons there is more balloons and the ones for the bachelorette theme . You need tattoos and the party games .
As a reviewer you doing a great job and   yes if your in Vegas it's the tradition to go to magic mikes.
She is cute and dresses nice
We love you you Nessa
Congrats Nessa,John
Bonusfinder surveyed 6,000 people to find out that over 70% of Americans cheat at bachelor, bachelorette parties. That precisely corresponds to a devorce rate numbers that allows to predict that the one who have bachelorette parties will get devorced most likely
Can we talk about Ronnie’s before and after facial 😮😍
i want this for myself when i’m older!! this is the dream😍😍
Veronica is such a great sister
9:30 the food looked so good!!!
Nessa seems so kind and she’s beautiful Ik I’m late but just wanted to say that
‘Woah from the side you look a lot like Roni, I don’t know why’ emmmmm 😂😂😂
Probably I'm the only one commenting this, but Nessa had a kinda sad expression in this video
Vanessa is such a great girl shes so kind and funny we🫶 her
I’m happy she’s getting married.
Yall my childhood, I can't believe yall are both now married
He is crazy
I love Nessa's dimples They compliment her face so well❤🎉
Nessa is so pretty and cute
Nessa is the nicest twin i've ever seen❤
8:58 is me cheering the twins on!!  Its twin goals to see them together showing off their rings 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
i love you, twins
i was cheesing so hard watching this
CONGRATS NESAAAA
SOOOOO CUTEEE
lmao i knew we were gonna get a video like hey guys we are married. happy for them tho 💜
Vanessa what day are you going to get married
Vanessa I'm so happy for you I'm so happy
Ur both married 🤷🏻‍♂️ how old are u???? I’m a identical twin and my brother is married, I’m not 👍🏻
Wow my God everything is happening so fast I remember watching you singing in you're garage and watching you're old videos love you roni and nessa
❤️💓💓❤️
Wow i didnt know yall are married or avout to get married. Oh goshhhh
The "I" falling is symbolic of you having to put yourself aside at times and put someone else above "Me" when you get married. Marriage is very serious and it takes a lot of work. Let that "I" falling be a sign to you that even now you must think about sharing everything and compromising when necessary. God bless your union.
she is the best
i think you have God party
very nice video
I love girls day vlogs ❤🥂🍹
Congratulations  to Vanessa!!!
Liked
Thumbs
Nessa! You could’ve also melted the chocolate and put it into a sandwich bag and cut the corner off and just piped small chocolate pieces too!
Very nice video👌👌👌👌👌👌
"They're gonna be like what is she drinking? wAtErrr" hahhahaha
Super 😘
2:24 It's funny that roni said this because there's no one else in this world that looks more like nessa than her 🤣🤣🤣
Here’s my prediction… Nessas married  And roni is expecting Hear me out Roni didn’t get a massage She was never seen actually drinking the beverages And she was wearing oversized stuff……  Maybe???

Nessa is so excited. Roni did such a fantastic job as a sister and maid of honor.  Excited to see her wedding and what the future holds.
Need to practice vlogging more cause to much circling around made me dizzy through out this whole video
No massage for Roni….. pregnancy clue???
So this video is from December?

I love that John told her they were going to Chuck E Cheese😂😂😂
Literally growing up seeing you two grow up with me was so cool I had the best time and i am sure that you will never disappoint us💓💓💓💓
Look at you showing off how boring you are. Paying money to YouTube so you can be first to scream that you’re just like everyone else. Don’t think! OBEY!
O M GOSH I HAVE WATCHED YOUR VIDEOS FOR 1 YEAR AND I HAD A DREAM JOHN WOULD PROPOSE TO NESSA AND HE DID!!!!!!!!!😄
Nessa, there is a few things I can say about her 😊 she has great style, super pretty, and has a great personality ❤
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎🤮
When is Vanessa getting married
Aww congratulations 💕Jon and Vanessa. The best couples
Let’s get them to 6.20M subscribers because they deserve it for posting amazing content for us ❤🎉
Vanessa and Roni look so pretty!!!❤❤
Nice things about nessa
Roni is so cute to Nessa,!!
First congrats to nessa and john!! Second, crazy idea, but what if franny, nezza and the twins do a song together👀
This was such a beautiful bachelorette party it was so relaxing and Nessa was so happy, what a great sister Roni is 💖💜 I can’t wait for the wedding I’m so excited for Nessa and John!!  I couldn’t stop smiling watching this🥰🥰
The way I've watched this many times already 😁
So happy for nessa and John
12:22 wow 😂 what a fun video
See Nessa being the little sister had to pay up sometime ,congratulations.lots of happiness to you and Jonh. Ps not everyone needs the extravagant barchorllete party dictated by society the fact that you ladies enjoyed your time together is enough the fact that people believe you need to be drunk in order to have had a fun night is absurd to me.
Ffs 🙄
I’m so happy Nezza and Franny are still so close with Nessa& Roni ❤
Did you conspire together to throw her that party? Or is that just a theory 🤔
Girl stuff stinks
You ladies are so cute and innocent ♥️ lol
NEVER WATCHED YOUU GUYS BEFORE,, BUT A HUGE CONGRATULATIONS TO THE HAPPY COUPLE, MAY YR  FUTURE BE HAPPY & BRIGHT. OH, & BY THE WAY I LOVE VANESSA’S DRESS, WHERE IS IT FROM?
So sweet! Congrats Nessa!
Nessa is my type of girl😇😇😇love you guys please shout me out this once in a life time.please guys😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Congratulations 🎊
So happy for you Nessa and John! I am so jealous of you!

This is the sweetest thing I've ever seen. None of my close friends are married or getting married (we're still kinda young) so I've never been to a bridal shower or Bachelorette party, but this just made me all the more excited for whenever my friends fall in love and get married💛💛💛 Congratulations again Nessa!

You twins are awesome. You could have chosen different significant others who don't have the same character as Aaron and John.  Things just got better with your choices and I think we all appreciate how you've transitioned from being single to married ladies while allowing us to watch the growth.  Thank you.
My so happy for Nessie hope you have a wonderful day love you guys ❤

I now understand what Frezza meant when they said they can't talk about the photo in the limo🤣🤣🤣🤣
We also have the Bachelorette Party here in Sweden, subjecting the man or woman to various challenges, embarrassing them with a smile on their face and dressing them up so they are embarrassed and have a lot of fun
