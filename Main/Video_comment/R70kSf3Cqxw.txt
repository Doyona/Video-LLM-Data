Where's Lokonga now?
Tales of horror at Salems Lot
beat west brom and then become west brom the next weeek
Don't anger the LORD VOLDEMORT.. He'll avada kedavra u...😂
Wenger out! Haha ffs
The greatest funniest channel on YouTube
the only way it changes is by voting with your feet.
Where’s dt
Conte signed Lukaku, Sanchez, Erkisen, Hakimi, Barella etc at Inter
But u need to see the 2 most slow player's in the field is Xhaka n Mari both on the left n Saka may be due to some discomfort was not tracking back as expected from him. So Tierney was all the more reserved in going forward n move inside to support Mari leaving the flank open to James. Situation will improve when Gabriel is back n Saka tracks back to help defender. In terms of pace Xhaka is our weakest link n when ever he plays all our player's on left side will be under pressure.
Poverty club😂😭
On the day of the Arteta appointment, I was the only one saying, totally wrong choice, it'll be a disaster in the making....Yes, Arsenal needs Conte, now more than ever...
Who seen the talking nose
With that squad, arteta is still the best manager for Arsenal. I agree brentford was a mistake and unacceptable but their next two games are tough one Chelsea and man city, the title favourites. Then judge him games after that.
winimng against westbrom means nothig.he still gonna lost over 20 game this sason
Sorry what did he say🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 6-0 yh
Well said voldemort
I wonder if the owners can see how much the fans are hurting week in week out.
you know something wrong when voldemort has spoken
Let’s pray West Brom beat arsenal
Stop turning up. Stop buying the merchandise. Or accept the slide to mid-table mediocrity and keep turning up in the latest replica kit.
Great! Now we have even made Voldemort mad.
It's Arsenal's only chance realistically of silverware, he shud play 11 first team players and get confidence and goals.......
Where is DT
These two look like aliens from men in black. Robbie looks like a ballchinian 😂😂
What was really going to be different this season? lets not be delusional. The club has been in a downward spiral for years now.
Arsenal football club has pablo Mari and robert holding 😭😭😭
someone answer should i bet on west brom for 20 ? return 150
The changes we've seen in the transfer window, and the young squad we have, it's a long term project, it's not a quick fix. Mikel has pretty much said this in several interviews. I have already written off this season apart from perhaps getting the luck of a cup win. My guess is a finish top half of the table but not top 5. Next year we should REALLY be competing for a top 4 place, and I think that is really where this project is targeting. If we boot Mikel out, we admit the project has failed, well before the project has run it's course. Just let him and the team get on with it.
As a Chelsea fan, this is my favorite youtube Channel
lee really remainds me of voldimort
Best part of seeing Arsenal lose is watching all the chavs who live off the dole slagging off people who have actually achieved something with their life.
chelsea loss to arsenal last season away game.. i think arsenal parked the bus after they scored (or was it tottenham?) but this win is sweet..
Robbie impersonates an interviewer but is clearly pushing opinions. And very clearly too.
I will tell you what the problem is with this club.  All their fans think they are something they are not. They are deluded the lot of them you cannot have a zero European Cup haul and basically no European pedigree and claim to be a big club so dear arsenal fans win some trophies that actually matter in the world of football and then start moaning.
This lad is the best on aftv love his passion for you lot this is coming from a fox
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
The most deluded fans in the Premier league...
Arsenal has the most left footers in each game and has more on the bench. PL should have at least 2 left footers starters and that is a left back and 1 more. U gonna loose if no body recognizes this
Nobody:  Me: That's Voldemort!
This is why half the Arsenal supporters are bald
Wolves fan here in peace. Love the passion of the fans. We all love our clubs and it hurts when it’s not going well.
Guys let trust the process...
I fill sorry for the boys they love the club you going down the same as Spurs
200million for what
So refreshing not to here fam or blood in the analysis 👏
Wenger IN
get leeds manager.. is far away better than arteta
Please beat West Brom  We all want him to stay
Any idea where DT is?
Lose to west brom and he should resign....setting the bar high there ,🤣🤣
Isn't it ironic that Arsenal is all about an armoury,and guns etc yet, they are looking for safety?!   Only legends will understand!
What is the problem???  The same problem that has been at the club since the last 3 years of the Wenger era.The current squad that played Saturday is not as good as our old second cup team they are a reasonable under 21 side.With the whole team available as the last few seasons they didn’t do it.The saving grace was winning the FA Cup.This season we will finish below where we finished last season.There are to many teams better than Arsenal this year..Why didn’t they try to buy Calvin Phillips from Leeds..
The end is classic  "Nice One" Robbie... "Niiicccee" Lee..  Two legends!!!
The fans need to stop going to matches. For how long does the loyalty give the owners and their decisions a by? Enough!! It's time to express the voice of the fans. If the fans don't take action, then they know they can bumble f* their way again for millionth time!
So Voldemort’s an arsenal fan?
Does anyone else think he looks like Charlie Jolson from The Getaway?
Conte drove inter Milan into bankruptcy by forcing signings... Ask any seria A fans
Big up Lee always spot on level headed, i just wish the club would listen 👊
Come on you spurs
2-0 wasn't a bad result when u think of the save Leno made. Lukaku shoulda scored that goal from the headwer. Arsenal's defending is shocking tbh. Take a step off and allow Lukaku to attempt to control it. Do not get tighyt to this guy bcos he's a big unti who will just roll u and either lay it off and move into the box or he's turning and running at u head on. Staying that close to this biglump is the wrong way to defend against him. When he goes to jump for a header just lean int him enough to put him off from getting a clean header on the ball.. Arsenal are abysmal Robbie and Lee.. Lee is spot pn about this team but more so about this manager.  CONTE would be a huge manager for the club. I would love a manager like Conte at Villa Park lads..  I'm obviously a Villa fan and seeing the AFC so shockingly bad is a disgrace to be perfectly hinest lads.. Great players come and go from football clubs but this manager is nowhere near good enough to manage a football club this size..  This is still a huge job for any top coach and If u could get a coach like CONTE then AFC would be making a massive statement. I think they've already got a new manager in the pipeline. I'm pretty sure they've been speaking to coaches during the summer to take over if things go south for ARTETA soon adn let's be honest He's done imho. I think nothing will save ARTETA's job now Gooners.. He out the door this weekend after City beat u up bad. If he does an Ole Gunnar Southgate I will be so shocked bcos he's a dead manager walking slowly to his sacking this weekend.. That's wht I believe anyways
This man knows his football.  Tierney was terrible
I thought he was interviewing Lord Voldermort.
Still got to lose to city next then west brom scrap a point 🤣👌 at this rate better of in the championship. This club will never be the same again.
Martinelli = 20m  Saka = 55m   Pepe = 31m  Total Value: 106m - not 200m..  you may have bought them for that but they’re not worth that today.
Arteta should retire
Where's DT nowadays?
Please keep arteta for the process till the end of the season, this is Tottenham supporter 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Did they model Voldemort on Lee?
Where is dt nowadays? He was one of the main reasons i watched aftv
hahaha get back to not celebrating Kane's goals for england baldy
Politics in football romove  Ozill, we are paying now
Ben white is not going to be that guy. And Mari will not be that guy.
Shirt number 10 Emil God Arsenal is confused
No Ozill no Arsenal,
What manager would wanna come to Arsenal?
Ty shaving balls. LOL
Arsenal prefers quantity to quality  That's our only problem £129M we would have bought only two quality playersto increase on the quality we have in partey Aub Pepe KT saka xhaka Gabriel
Had me at 5yrds here 5yrds there bosh..whereas martinellis running 35yrd here 35yrds there 🤣
If I owned Arsenal, AFTV and all its sycophants would be banned for 7 straight yrs from the Emirates they are a cancer some guys have watched football more yrs than Arteta has nd know how luck and fortunes turn in football but are always constantly repeating so and so out this Wenger curse will never leave us because of this characters
"If they were at a real big club" 😂 😂 😂 😂
Lee knows ball
I rated Arteta until he extended Xhaka's contract. I knew then nothing will change in the dressing room let alone on the pitch. Most of these young lads need a leader that can perform rather than a captain that's average but doesn't play out from the back. Y'all see it and think it's Arteta but he is not on that pitch in those times. You can't coach a player to do the impossible,  it has to come from them. Simple
They did not have the players to get back into the game. Arteta's greatest mistake in this game was playing Partey in a friendly against Chelsea 3 weeks ago.
No lee win against westbrom  and arteta out still no matter the result even a win against city arteta needs to go he hasn't got a clue and one of the positions arsenal need to fix more then anything is a striker auba nketiah laca Bakugan martinelli are not good enough .Chelsea buy Werner he wansant doin it up front they then go after another striker and now look at them . Lampard wasn't working they go get a top manager and again win the champions league. Until arteta is out and we get a manager in who knows wot the hell he is doin and can get these players properly fired up to play  attacking football nothing will change sacking  him  is the best thing that joke of a board can do . Also that includes holding chambers lacazette nketiah elneny  get rid . I would trust  a serial killer more  then arteta
Arsenal are in trouble for sure
Arteta is the perfect yes man.The board won't sack him anyway.
Lee is top. My respect goes up for him
Come on lads. Playing at home, at the Emirates, on a Saturday. That's about as tough as it gets. Tougher than on a cold rainy night in Stoke for sure. No way we could have won when the odds are stacked against you by so much. The season is still young though. We'll get those 0-3 and 0-4 loses yet. Believe!
Tierney out of position for both goals...
Lee judges conte was given millions... how does one get the likes of Lukaku and hakimi etc and not spend a fortune.
Get big Sam alidice for next manager to keep us in the premiership or championship next season, I'm throwing away my season ticket after this rubbish. 😭😭😭😭😭😭👍
Bring back tony Adams urgently 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nah, we should keep him. Trust the process!! Off to the championship!!!
arsenal fans have to retire from being fans of arsenal. there are 13 teams in london. they can go for a winning team. it isnt artetas fault the players dont want it bad enough.
200m worth of talent between pepe saka and martineli? Can someone get me the drugs Lee is taking?
I hope Arteta gets his first sack on a Monday morning on the training pitch in front of the new Coach
Banter FC
what a clowns fans club, always have a good lough 🤣
I have no arsenal players in my dream team 😅
Chelsea has more young players playing regularly than arsenal 👀
Many fan dnt wnt wenger dnt wnt top 4 evry year this wat mny want
Where is DT?
I can assure you, as an Inter Milan fan, that that is NOT how things went between Conte and Inter. The board gave the manager a 3-year contract, €12mln per year, and they backed him thoroughly. Conte was given the chance to completely change his squad because Inter Milan just wasn't geared to play with a back 3, and in 2 years, they brought in Lukaku (€75mln), Barella (€45mln), Eriksen (€25mln) and Hakimi (€40mln) just to name a few. The reason Conte left is because the board told him that not only did they lack funds to keep investing in the summer, but that they also had to sell some big-name players as well, so he decided to leave a sinking ship. And just like that, Inter lost Conte and Hakimi by July, and Lukaku in August.  So yeah, things are quite different to what Lee just told here, and Conte is certainly not coming to Arsenal if he can't be backed by the board
New season, Same Arsenal
Arsenal need new fans
"If they woz at Chelsea or they woz at a real real top club......" Oh the bitterness! 🤣🤣🤣💙
If u compare villas signings this summer and those arsenal signed this season u cry arteta and edu a digging a grave for our beloved arsenal how can u waste of 125 million on useless  players
If you gathered up all the dogshit in a mile radius of the Emirates, made a big pile and then used a moped to wheelspin through it, that would be Arsenal. 100% dogshit wheelspin
We shouldn't have sucked wenger... at least top 4 was consistent and in a matter of time he could have won the epl
"Arteta can't be in our football club no more. That much I do know"  "Football club? Hes GOTTA GO!"
We had as many chances as any other mid-table team would have against Chelsea
Voldemort is furious
Only going to get worse
I honestly feel sorry for Arsenal. But one thing for sure is that Arsenal will come out of this rough patch. It happened to other big teams before. Arsenal is a big team and they will bounce back
arsenal are a massive club and should not be in this position ,im a spurs fan
Just here for my daily laughs
saka will leave next summer to city,he not a sub he is in the england team
He’s not going to improve. He’s too intense and it’s rubbed off on the players. He’s got to go now. I’m sick of Robbie playing devils advocate, this is not a joke, don’t have a channel talking grown up stuff if you’re act like a baby Robbie, he has to go now!
Don't we have enough bad results, and why it has to be the West Brom game?  Losing to Brentford was already terrible enough.
Did I just hear that right? Did Lee just say Saka and Martinelli are worth 200 million pounds? What's he been smoking?
When you have Auba,Laca,Pepe,Saka,Mertineli,Smith rowe and Odegaard and you can't score and create little what does that mean?,i am talking about since last season we still have the same problem nothing have changed,i am sure a proper coach can have a team to fear no matter what people say bcs of the performance
Remember when you were crying about finishing in the top 4 every year and got your greatest manger wenger sacked careful what you wish for haha
Arteta out 👍👍
No Dt no Troopz no Kelachi whats wrong with aftv
We are very tired and unhappy because of very poor performance of Arteta, he must leave
Give Arteta a contract extension, the mans doing wonders.
I genuinely like Lee, I’m a Chelsea fan & he is a realist. I respect fans that aren’t deluded fools like Ty.
Where is DT
Why would Conte want to go there lol
Fabio Romano Confirmed the Championship here we go .
You cant judge Arsenal against Chelsea, there years behind now, there have new players see how they do over the next couple of years.
I'm a Liverpool fan and I love this channel. Robbie is such s good dude. The premier League not only needs Arsenal, it needs a GOOD Arsenal. One of English footballs royalty clubs and they are absolutely awful, what is going on?? Arteta clearly isn't the man. Best to make a change now so they still have a chance to do something this season. But they won't will they? They'll wait until 15 games of the season have gone by which time it will be too late.
Why my man in the thumbnail looking like voldemort from harry potter? Lmfao
Agreed the west brom and Norwich games could be big for arteta if arsenal can't get a result in those games he should be sacked.
Let’s get this right aftv are rubbish Robbie out
Why don't you become the Head Coach !!!! You ask resignations of each manager after 1 season. It's very easy to criticize. Your facts are bald as you are. I'm not saying trust the process. But give Mikel Arteta this season. And as a matter of "FACT" today we conceded 2 goals because Bukayo Saka didn't cover Reece James. You're gonna criticize the Guy ??? Aren't you
Win at West Brom and Arteta should still resign! Go!
Look, the Premier League isn't ya two trick pony no more.... Them days are gone, we have a much more competitive league now. You Command the sort of players to your team's ranking, Arsenal are a mid table team now and will Command as such.
Arsenal are so bad nowadays that us opposition fans are starting to feel sorry for them. Don't know who calls the shots over there but even a blind man can see that Arteta is way out of his league over there at Arsenal, he needs to be sacked ASAP. It's not going to get better anytime soon with him in charge.
The only reason I'm subscribed to this channel is that... I'm really enjoying this 😂😂
October… that’s all he’s got
Im a chelsea supporter and i feel i have slowly been watching the demise of arsenal football club they have been going downhill for a number of years the players quality is poor and managers can only play with what they have got i feel the problem is the owner of the club is it kroenke ? Sorry dont know how you spell his name. Hes bled your club dry, i feel sorry for all arsenal supporters who once had one of the best clubs in england and also europe (untouchables) what a sad fall from grace. P.s your getting rid of lenno for a better keeper is sheffield utd keeper better or just a buisness deal for kroenke to make a few more quid.
lee makes an important point...even at our worst under Wenger, we never stopped creating chances.
It was saka that left tierney exposed fs. Tierney was back
Where was DT?
.        .          What is Arsenal's DNA ? George Graham, Wenger's predecessor, played a very different style of football to the Frenchman. The club is over a century old and Wenger's trophy-laden years lasted around a decade  .  So, to assume that the style of play that the Invincibles or the 98'/99' team played as Arsenal's DNA is false and to expect every manager to play that way without having the tools indicates misplaced  optimism.    Sincerely,  not an Arsenal fan
where’s DT?
Spot on about Tierney. Not his fault cos he’s someone who gives everything, but Arteta should have seen it. Was so funny when the Arsenal fans cheered him sprinting up the pitch, leaving a massive hole. That was part of the problem but the fans lapped it up. Classic.
I did not even watch the game.
Arteter
A very knowledgeable fan. Arsenal look in all kinds of trouble.
Outfought and outclassed by Chelsea
Long time AFTV viewer. Over the past couple years I only come back every now and then to see whats going on.  Looks like nothing has changed.  I think these people need to get another hobby. It’s bad for your health.
so far the best part of our season was the first 10 minutes in the brentford game.
there was a time we celebrated arsenal winning trophies. now we celebrate getting 40+ points and staying up.
Arsenal such a poor team, should be degraded for sure 👎
God. I love Lee but Jesus. He really thinks Saka, Martinelli and Pepe are worth 200 million. All 3 of them have proven absolutely nothing to suggest they are worth 65 mil each lol wtf.
I see Voldemort
Yip, Lee at 6:07, i am a Newcastle fan, out for the day, few extra drinks, the only downside is when kick off approaches and you feel instant gloom, just not believing will win, sad thing but true.
Just here to turn on notifications for Wednesday night
Lord Voldemort?
For all the people that trusted the process, deserve this. I wanted Arteta out last November and people were saying "wait, Trust the PRocess" etc. Is this the process you all "trusted" in?.
Absolutely outclassed, brutal to watch.
It is weird to see Balogun stays close to the goal post during their corner kicks. When he able to run forward and counter attack if the GK gets the ball and try to pass forward immediately? We will have no striker up front.
Get used to losing looool trash
Lol
I think Arsenal will beat Man City. You heard it here first
WEST BROM?????????????????????????????? Only Arsenal can make West Brom looks like Barcelona. Damn....
Shite
If we lost playing good football and looking like an organised bunch of players our fans would say "fair play" and look forward to a good season but all we can see dire tactics, organisation, understanding, creativity, ect ect ect...   Kronke has got to do with Arteta the same thing that Abramovic did with Lampard... like immediately!!
If we win can we get LeeJudges Out?
Arteta is NOT the problem. I support Arteta. After Unai Emery - we need a legacy manager that stays with the club for 10+ years. Look at Alex Ferguson at Man Utd - he had a horror start and was 1 game away from being sacked and look how that turned out ! The core problem is Kronkes - they do not care about a great traditional club - they use Arsenal as a bargaining chip to leverage debt for their US Sports Teams. We need Arsenal to be relegated and then get Kronkes to sell to get ROI on their investment and then press the restart button with no players rinsing the club for big wages and no effort and build the club back again !
Exactly right about sambi lokonga, hes been our best player in these past 2 games
Why don't we press teams? All the top sides press. Arteta obviously has a secret genius strategy, that allows sides to do whatever they want ,so we draw them into a false security. We need a new manager.
Lolol ur still complaining 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Where’s DT ?
Pre season poor form Robbie said " its only pre season "  First three games of this season Robbie says "we don't expect to win against Chelsea or City"   The mentality of our fans has fallen from a great height.
martinelli worth 100million, what is this man smoking?
Voldermort talks a lot of sense
Lee bang on
My lawd we’ve fallen to such depths that we’re calling Lakonga “outstanding”. My my!
Robbie: “There was that chance for Rob Holding (the header), I thought he should’ve done better.” Lee: “Centre half though, Robbie.” Centre halfs are meant to be good with their head, Lee.
Conte said no to Spurs because they were in no position to challenge...that should answer Lees question 😂
The teeny physician immunohistologically bomb because jump spindly turn excluding a dapper hardhat. domineering, easy path
As far as Arteta is managing Arsenal the team will keep dropping points unless they suck him, or we as Arsenal supporters demonstrate and force him out we're tired of him.
“The attacking players are doing the work of the defenders” lee is 500% correct here  This couldn’t be more correct. We will not proceed further as a club if this continues.  We need a solid back 4 with a cDm Only then could we get back to where we used to be
Do someone know what is going on with Dt? Haven't seen him on aftv in like forever
he who shall not be named
Robbie I saw you arguing on talksport that you don't profit from arsenal being bad at the moment, I was with you that day but not now, 2 games into the season and you have a video titled "have arsenal wasted £129m?" How are you going to argue that isn't negativity? 2 GAMES!!  I might set up a channel for arsenal fans that understand the situation and what is needed right now, prob only be 4 of us though
Lee could have cropped this by 7.45 minutes. Gritted teeth and ‘Faaakiinn Shaaaaaat’ would have done.
£200m worth of talent and the front 3 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that's the best comment yet. What an idiot 🤣🤣🤣
Do they just moan about the tactics without backing it up? Never hear anyone say we were terrible we could have done this, its all just "we are terrible"  Anyone can say that
What do i need to do to talk to you? Talk some sense, the guys you speak to either think we played quite well or want the manager gone. One end of the scale to the other. For example we never looked like scoring, smith rowe and holding could have scored and could have had a penalty. Yes it wasn't a good performance but it was the dog and duck either. The ONLY person not making is excuses is the manager 🤣🤣
Robbie and Lee are completely manscaped
We are pony and have been for the last 15 years, stop all the bollox and living in cuckoo land! What's happened to the big massive PROTEST? SUMS UP OUR ONCE GREAT CLUB!
Where is DT?
Am a fan from West Africa Sierra Leone, you the fans in England is also the problem. Man united, Liverpool or Chelsea will never encourage this system, they should have demonstrate long since to kick kroenkey out of the club. But you in doing nothing just grumbling with no action. Mobilize as fans an do something.
The only positive i took from the game is that i won my bet and am happy🙂🙂 🔴⚪️
Nobody talks about our Saka penalty.....
The goals Chelsea scored were too easy.
Arteta is unqualified and inexperienced. He would be lucky to manage a U21 squad.
I don’t watch Arsenal just come here for comedy but arteta Is probably trying to re create what he learned at Man City with pep and not being his own manager and it’s failing
Lee judges for prime minister🎯
Did fans really expect a taking any points from this game? Get real. Wake the hell up. Look at all the players we're missing.
Conte to arsenal lol, mid table clubs often hire mid table quality managers. F,e sam aladyce would be a more realistic appointment to happen
Fair play to lee very honest nice to see tbf 👏
This team is made for 3-5-2 . Please get this T Rex out of the club and bring back Saliba and Guendozi . The players are all stressed , Auba looking like a crack head with Arteta’s tactics
Arsenal are a long term project now.  They are miles off top 4. I would give the manager more time - much more time.
Nosferatu is right!
He expected them to go down more than they Did?   And how about....let's get a couple of facts right.  That doesn't make sense. A fact is a fact which means it's already right.  Comical.
Lee one of the few who talks sense in AFTV
Watching the aftermath of yet another Arsenal defeat is fast becoming the highlight of the season.
Do not wait.  Arteta OUT now immediately
Arsenal's problem is that they have lost their identity. All those years when Wenger won nothing but guaranteed them Champions league football, subconsciously they were telling themselves that it's okay to be mediocre. Arsenal is a big club. If a coach fails to win anything in  a season or two he should be sacked. That way you are giving out a message that you don't accept mediocrity. But they allowed Wenger to go 9 years without  a major trophy. Yes he guaranteed them Champions league football in that time but in the process they lost their identity. The way forward: they need to bring in a radical coach. In my opinion Conte is the right man. Bring him in, give him the players he  needs and he will restore the winning mentality.
man scaped? what exactly is robbie scaping
For once one Arsenal fan that talks a lot of sense. Well done mate
Just wait till you play City
Rookie Manager?  Anyone?
nah gee don't give me that 21 thing, ronaldo was 20 when he won his first World best and messi 22, so can we allow age
Lee is wrong about Conte, the way we hired coach we can't afford Conte.
Everyone who isn't an Arsenal fan said, when the fans moaned about Wenger only getting 4th!, be careful what you wish for --------they didn't see they had no divine right to be successful.
They loaded the left hand side and once our players got sucked across Reece James on the right hand side was brilliant. Closest player to James for the first goal was Xhaka. That shouldn’t be happening, love Tierney but it’s his side and it was too easy.
Lees the best bloke on AFTV without a doubt, no delusion straight to the point and enjoying to watch from a football fans perspective
Not even a arsenal fan but this man is speaking facts get rid of ty the man just makes you look bad
Teirney going forward was and is the only creative outlet arsenal have, its someone behind him, taking responsibility to fill in and cover for him. Massive clear out needed at Arsenal.
Wenger out!!!u all wanted it..
Lee is a real one! You can tell he’s played football at a good level. High football iQ. Arteta is in his 3rd season and none of us can say what style of play the man wants! We are doomed!
AFTV Helped kill Arsenal
Voldemort 🤷🏽‍♂️
Always liked Lee but he is truly going against what he was going on about last year?? Arteta must play Martineli,?    he played him and Lee questions why he runs about?? and Lakaku doesnt,? that is why the player cost 97 + million pounds
Ty: We beat them on corners
Woeful, no ambition, no style, no football identity. At least the world watches the demise of a great team under korenke, EDU and arteta. EARLY CLEAR OUT CONTE IN. 5 new  signings 10 days in transfer
Ty:  at least we are still unbeaten at Highbury for 15 years
Arteta should've gone last year.
Where is DT? pls I missed him
Lord Voldemort said it all ^
2 things.  Why do most arsenal fans say ' its two games, its not. Its been a season a half 🤣  2. Please explain how one earth people are still backing him
Saka, martinelli, pepe 200million ?!
Arteta out
DT is no longer part of ArsenalTV? Im not arsenal fan but I liked watching him
Why does Robbie keep forgetting that Arteta has been in the job for 20 months, not just since the start of this season? Always the same rhetoric - 'already?' 'it's only been 2 games'. No it hasn't! It's been 20 months of big investment and little progress.
I can already hear what Dan is going to say 😅
wheres dt?
Instead of thinking about Arsenal for a headache... for sure Arsenal will be relegated this season.....
How we let go of Ozil and the likes is beyond me
Arteta was a mid table player and he is a mid table manager!
Robbie “should, Could, Would,” not working
Where is DT?
No 9 player in
Tierney plays his heart out for us every match. Bit disrespectful to no even mention him in a positive way. He's future captain.
Lee is the only one who is deadly serious about the club
I'm sure when Manscaped was founded, they envisioned a delusional manchild shaving a kiwi as their ideal promotion
Manscaped won't sell anything at Arsenal; No balls found
Just here for the banter
Dont forget that Arteta did not want ozil.
Arteta is a major problem but pretending that getting rid of him will fix everything won’t help anything
Tierney is our only way of attacking that's why he's bombing down the wing. Play through the middle. Mix our play up a bit. We are sooooooo predictable 😒
who is arranging the plane with banner
Arsenal are rubbish,  there the new Tottenham
5:25 I saw bukayo saka🤣🤣
Here's something to think about or suggest to a billionaire for a challenge: 1. Ask the FA to include 1 more team into the league. 2. Let a group of fans/supporters to be a coach/manager 3. Let them run an EPL team and see how they go.  Would be interesting and fun to see how it turns out. Would make a great doco. What do u think, people?
WE NEED TO HAVE A HEALING AND A BIG BIG APOLOGY TO ARSEN WENGER ANYBODY WHO DISAGREES IS WHY WE GET WHAT WE DESERVE WE DOD ARSEN WENGER A BIG WRONG WE WERE NOT LOYAL AND VERY UNGRATEFUL IF YOU WERE FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY BACK THEN WHAT ARE WE NOW IN THE RELAGATION ZONE TURNED OVER BY BRENTFORD WE ARE THE PRISON BITCH OF THE PREMIERSHIP LUBE UP FOR THE SEASON  OR THEY WILL BE GOING IN DRY!!!!
Lord Voldemort
We’re a joke won’t support arsenal till they get a decent manager had enough!
What does it matter? Rejoice! Wenger is out. Mission accomplished.
Sambi is really great.  He really needs support
Honestly Mikel can win if with this line up against Chelsea one week earlier against Brentford. So I don't see any problem beating WBA.
Lokonga is playing well but I feel like the same will happen with lokonga as Pepe and partey. One player playing very well but for no results and eventually start losing it
Why wait until after the West Brom game,so does it mean if Arsenal beat West Brom then it's ok for him to stay?Arteta should be sacked immediately,this is why I miss Claude
The problem with most Arsenal fans is we're too emotional than logical at analysing & commenting concerning whatever situation our dear club Arsenal is in.. if a player was not played fans will scream why wasn't this & that player used, when they're played the following game, they'll say why play him in this game, the manager should have played this other player instead.. some will say play this & that tactic/style, when we play it & don't win, they say why did he play such style.. we need to understand that first our ambition as a club aren't clearly spelt out, that's what lead us to Arteta (rather let me say the board's ambition is not the fans ambition. I think the board wants to build a team for the future, say 2 seasons coming, but the fans want a team that can compete now & win trophies as well.. so I think both fans & board needs to clearly align their ambitions so we stop having this conflict of interest!
Premier league is too tough for arsenal maybe in the championship they might win something yeah..
Don’t understand,why must wait another lose for get new manager?is that not enough for now?Arteta is nothing…he never proven anything…
Can i just ask Robbie why the hell he thought it would be a good idea to send Ty into the fan debate with Neville and Carragher etc instead of literally anyone else?  Ty is a great guy but 100% the wrong choice for that particular debate.
Arsenal the gift that just keeps on giving 😂😂😂😂⚒️⚒️⚒️⚒️⚒️⚒️
Arteta is turning all the strikers into flops. Nobody can score a goal under these tactics.
Dracula speaks sense
Lol
I'm feeling bad for arsenal fans right now.. they're all getting bald 1 by 1 🥺
some how I am super disappointed by the way Lee and all these guys talk about how we are playing at the moment, we are missing 9 key players and the premier league doesn't care, but as fans we should stand with the team not attack it... I can see what Mikel is doing and if you don't then you are not a fan of football. The same 21 year old you were constantly crying for last season?
Fakest moncler I’ve ever seen peeking in hahahahaha
Chelsea just looked like they were cruising the whole game, never really have to go into over drive
Arteta should have been sacked at the end of last season. I am actually not surprised by any of these results or by any trouble that lies ahead. Being told that Lacazette and Aubameyang will change this predicament is clouding the real problem. We can't defend, we have a weak squad and uneducated manager who is still picking up his experience. Guinea Pig FC.
mari is really bad i hope i never get to see him play again
Getting worse out of his depth
Arsenal is embarrassing.
Lee is totally wrong on comparing Lukakus play side by side with Martinelli's. they obviously dont have same build hence cant expect them to play same way. Lee can never make a good manager yet he can go off on Arteta. This is exactly how we had the Wenger out, Good ebening out situation and now we are gearing up to kick another out simply based on feelings and not good judgment!
Where is DT?
Where is dt and cloude ?
Why is Robbie coming here Sugar coating this team performance under mikel Arteta...as manager...get a better manager asap
AFTV is getting bashed for so many years for criticising arsenal...but you know AFTV is 100% are right....Truth always hurts..Our club is in shambles....we need a new management and buying a 50m defender whos not even world class....choosing a Defender who was bullied by Lukaku the entire 90 mins 😭😭hes not even good enough to play in championship
No Arsenal players will play in any of the top 4 clubs first teams.  That says alot to where they are. Sad as they have had some of the PL best ever players.
Where is dt guys?
This is the guy who said London would be red only one week ago?
TY: If the match were played the last 45mins, it would be a draw.
Lee spot on we need Arteta out he doesn't  have any good  tactics
They are not kids, they are PAID Professional footballers. Saka was asleep on that left hand side. Nobody called Jadon Sancho a kid at BVB and look what he has done. Arsenal players need to play this is a football club and not a day care.
Even if Arteta is sacked there will be no Manager who can safe Arsenal from this mysterious. It is not about tactics it is about Mentality and Arsenal players are mentally dead. So do the fans.
Speaking to AFTV about firing Arteta why not just organize and make the statement clear to the ones responsible and with the power to fire him and do something.
Everybody is trolling arsenal these days...but I'm sure arsenal will surprise everyone by winning the World Cup 😂😂😂
he should resign now!!!!!
It  was Arsenal players been taken to football  school . Arsenal was shown what playing football was all about both in defence and attack.
Lee is the only arsenal fan (apart from the don) on aftv that talks proper sense. Put him in the managers seat.
Arsenal suck...i think Arteta bad manager, and kronke still cant pay his debt
Wenger in
I bet Ty peeled the name ARSENAL in that potato
Bro not even a world class manager like unai Emery could fix this squad. Manager is not the problem
More bollocks shown in the first 10 seconds of this vid than on the pitch from Arsenal
Asking  Saka to attack and defend  at 20years of age 🙀 especially coming back after what he went through ( national team)  he isn’t even fit and it was so obvious that even Steve wonder could see it.
It's not the manager or tactics mate the simple fact is you need better players
Martinelli & Saka worth 200mil 🤣🤣🤣 And Conte left Inter because they are skint. This lot are living in a world of make believe. Conte wouldn't go anywhere near the Arsenal job.
Where'd DT go?
Robbie if chelsea had 5 key players missing we’d still beat u. No kante on comes kovacic, no lukaku on comes werner, no james on comes hudson odoi, no Azpi on comes T.Silva, no mount on comes ziyech. In fact Kanté was a key player who didn’t even start he came on for the last 20 mins and you basically counted auba as one of ur players who was missing so I can do the same with ngolo. Kante came on 70th min auba came on 60th. Please think before speaking.
this is pure football karma, arteta bn punished for the way he treated  and still treats some of our players. the sad thig is we the fans and our great club is suffering with him, we dont deserve this, plz plz someone get rid of arteta, hz to arrogant  bias an disrespectful to certain players nd it having a negative effect on the squad plus no tactical awareness. he has to go now b4 its too late.
Get Conte to replace Arteta:from a Liverpool fan
we literally NEVER look like scoring
arsenal will definitely win for the next season, but in the efl championship
Where is ur trust the process??? Aftv
Lees hand playing piano around  7.mins
tell em lee!
We are outclassed , outperform it's men Vs boys we look clueless
I am not confident that we will beat west Bromwich
Lee judges bringing in the knowledge and the views. DT who? Troopz who?
Having 7 players out is real difficult. Just ask Liverpool who had just 3 out last season. and city when only de bruyne and aguero were out. So be alittle understanding of the situation given that Arsenal does not even come close to having the replacements that were arvailable to City or liverpool.
Useless club all the management there are so corrupt and stingy
Conte should of been brought in and handed 150mil
Excuses, excuses, Deja Vu.
Robbie have to understand one thing, if today Arteta is coaching either manu, Chelsea, man city or Liverpool, do u see him long gone already or do u still think he should be given more time? We all know the answer but why should Arsenal give him more time based on the performance of the squad for the past 18 months. We are big club not average club, we don’t need an average manager who need more time, we need a top class manager who can bring arsenal to next level with immediate impact.
First man I’ve ever seen, able to wind himself up.
It's no longer surprise to see Arsenal losing nowadays. The people running the club is ruining club. It's better for these supporters to support Tottenham which is obviously a way better North London club
PABLO MARI OUT
Vs brentford : pragmatise Vs chelsea : gegenpress Hahahahhhaha?!!!!
At first i suggested Arsenal to get Klop to replace Wenger, look what he has done now at Liverpool he has created a proper football team to challenge for trophies. Then i suggested Thomas Tuchel when he was at Dortmund look at him now. Now seriously i am suggesting to get Antonio Conte he definitely knows how to win trophies. Lastly sack Edu and appoint Me i can do a much better job than him🤔
What happened to dt ?
If City put 3 or More pass Arsenal next weekend Artetha is going to find him self in the same situation as Frank Lampard
Come guys forget that Conte idea..Every club conte been at it always end the same way..He demands players.I needs Boards to back him..so at Arsenal this will be spinning top in mudd.
New Camera is 🔥🔥🔥Anyway , We are the New Liverpool. It took `em 30 years. We are at year 17 . Buckle up my Gooners . Much Love 🔴⚪️
Please sign Kante
Lose to West Brom and your club should resign from premier league. Not Arteta
If any of you feels more qualified than Arteta, apply for his job and stop complaining. This is a young team that should be given time to build.
Arteta out,  TODAY
New camera is quality
Lee making sense as always.
Why would Conte come to Arsenal . 😅
Since Claude sadly passed away, lee judges carries his torch, he is the best in aftv in my opinion
I like this guy.
Nothing to discuss, Arteta out
I feel like it’s déjà vu every week with Arsenal, they identify the same issuers but nothings fixed 😆
Arsenal are now a Pepsi club. Bottle FC
Where is DT please? Really missed him.
Saka isn't a kid mate. He is all the man he will ever be.
Arsenal need experience players and striker who can hold the ball like lukaku
THe judge knows the koo of west London is kings.
That guy behind Lee resembles me as an arsenal fan,the guy looks stressful with this arsenal football club
Arteta out!! He is a cone boy learning on the job.
The first goal from leno why they use him and second problem is arsenal need a striker material before the window close
Where has dt gone
It's going to get worse
The defenders were being bullied by Lukaku and there was no teacher around to report it to.
Arteta is already break reacords negatively, I said earlier what he know is to disintegrate the team selling best players and talking to much downgrade process will continues until arteta sacked.
Why wait until west brown sack him now
Wenger out
The players aren't good enough, can't understand why no one sees this. Elite coaches like Conte are not going to risk their reputation by signing for a club with a poor squad and clearly no plan to rectify this problem. Other than Saka no other player in the squad would make the squad of any of the top 4 clubs.
AFTV the best entertainment
Is Dt still on the channel or has he left or something ?
Arsenal has children in the club
As a Chelsea fan this is "my to go" after Chelsea vs Arsenal lol... Yes head to head   arsenal still ahead but the past 20 years 😂😂... Love seeing frustrated Arsenal fans, pure comedy 😆😅😅😂😂
the same person who keep shouting WengerOut. you wish for it. you get it.
Look at the bright side... Arsenal are only 3 points behind Man City and 4 points behind Man United... lol
That’s why I don’t like Robbie so much because he loves mediocre football and feeds on negativity!!
love this guy so pleased he took time out from filming lord of the rings..............arteta out
I used to come here for entertainment, but these analyses are way better than TV pundits'  Good luck guys
Xavi, messi, Iniesta,bosquet,were dominated by young Arsenal players and Arsenal got results with veery best Barcelona,why?? Because Arsene Wenger was far better manager. Arsenal defeats is contributed by having PE teacher as your Manager
WBA 2-0 Arsenal
This man has a real hatred for Tierney lol
Play the kids...dont play the kids too much...this deluded fanbase keeps giving 😂🤣😂🤣
Tbh I don't see anything good in ESW
Am very pleased to see this happened to arsenal after the disrespectful way they send off arsene wenger it's great that this is happening to show how great off a manager wenger was
One is champion of Europe, another team is the champion of England, FA champion, League cup champion, second division champion….., these are all excuses, get rid of the manager and everything will be okay
Couldn’t disagree more, why would Arteta resign after he’s bought all these young players. This is going to take time, it was always going to take time. People living in dreamland expecting miracles! We ain’t doing anything this season so shut up and let him build his team
Before you blame Mikel Arteta you should what's the better lineup that  should start?? You have no world class players
as a wise man once said, "IT'S TIME TO GO!"
Lord voldermot
Been an arsenal fan since 2004, I no longer care
3 of 4 people on screen have paid for the new kits lol Kroenke is laughing at you
Where is DT?
The reason you hear grumbles for Arteta to go, and not clamour, is because the fans don't have confidence in the board to act decisively. Most fans would push the button on his ejector seat today! But we know that after the worst run in decades (in Q4 2020), during which around 19 teams out of 20 would probably have sacked the manager, they stuck with Arteta. Arteta out, Conte in. SIMPLES
The fact Arsenal fans rate average players like Tierney so highly shows how much the standard has fallen
Win or Lose agaist west brom, Arteta should resign bcs we will face many hard games !
Sack both Edu and Arteta, worthless people, look and study how Wenger did all the thing by himself, look what Dortmund did in recent years, hire Conte and Campos
Arteta out... We need a new manager.... Please....
Pepe, Martinelli & Saka are not worth £200m, your having a laugh
Chelsea supporter but I'm not here to mock. Lee always speaks sense. I enjoy listening to him. He's the best on there.
So peti to lose 2 0 agenest   Brentford now Chelsea
Arsenal expected to lose against Chelsea and Man City. Brentford is the bad one to lose and the only game Arsenal have dropped points in if we're being realistic.
These guys put saka and ben white in a combined 11 w chelsea. Lol asides from tierney you'd be lucky to make our bench no offense. but hopefully arsenal bounces back
why didn’t the club just keep wenger at this point,??? Lol it’s been shite. Ain’t no better at all
Wheres DT
Holding missed with an open header--other than that forget it! Saka isn't looking very confident. Lukaku made Mari look invisible! We are in a mess!!
Anybody remember Carlos Queiroz? He was Alex Ferguson helper..like Arteta with Pep...and Real Madrid made same mistake like Arsenal and hired him....Big mistake..the guy ruined Real Madrid like Arteta is doing with Arsenal...Arteta is born with a lot of luck...average player ends to be Arsenal captain 🤣🤣🤣🤣and now Arsenal coach.....why this guy deserves more respect than Freddie....and Freddie is a legend for this club....Arteta is a 🤡
where is the old Arsenal game, sad to see now.
Why the hell you guys still  kept Arteta 😓
Nice goal keeper kit that guys in the back in wearing
Sell Kroenke Sell the board as well and then Arteta can follow.
Can anyone tell me where is DT? Has he left AFTV?
If conte goes to arsenal then they will be a top 4 club instantly.  That's how good he is . He gave my club a premier league .
Arteta should stop giving excuses and excuse himself out of the club before AFC made history in the worst start of the season with bottom of the table & not scoring.
Arsenal has now lost 2 consecutive games, conceded 2 in each of their last 2 and are now 19th on the league table....CRIMINAL!!!!🙄
I'm not an Arsenal fan but love this channel.  No clueless media he goes right to the fans love it.
Betting against arsenal is very easy
La Konga is that spanish version of Konga 🤔
Many ppl forget that the same chelsea squad that won CL was at 8th position when lampard was sacked.
Baldy looks like retired voldemort
Love to see it
Lee and Robbie book a ticket to Turkey!
Season starts at Norwich 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely no way that will happen. There is zero chance of any Premier league manager resigning with the payoff they will get when sacked
Lee is the most honest and objective amongst them all. Not the Ty madness
Axe arteta
Pepe Out
were not angry anymore, it is just funny to watch aftv after losses
arteta should not even be here. Hes presence is just a huge humiliation
Don't worry guys, Arsenal will beat City 😆🤣😂😅
Arsenal failed to prepare, which is preparing to fail. This club is in the gutter.
Waffle
How long is the season pls ? Wait ffs
Be quiet you plum  it’s your big mouth. That’s your club where it is now and it’s a joy to behold
Poor recruiting has also led too this.
Lee is spot on about Conte at Inter.  Cannot believe Spuds though; Wolves peppered them yet they scrape the 0-1. Pfff, ah well the b-tec J0se's luck will run out soon too.
CHELSEA fan here, and it’s just sad to see Arsenal this way. Great rivarly should brought by brilliance of play from both sides. Y’all should go all out for Conte, he is a proven winner time after time. Your talented young squad needs proper guidance from someone who has a clear tactical philosophy and personality like Conte!
I’m concerned about DTs welfare.
TY  I think we can make top 4 still.
Fact
just trust the process guys. Maybe it takes 10 or 30 years :p
Felt his pain,  imagine paying 60 quid week in week out just to get bummed out
Next up man city.Robbie may own manscape at this rate,
no. He should just resign now
Hi Robbie this is Richard from Uganda all over the world people support Arsenal Football Club but the board's committee and  the couch they don't know how to help my team so this is my prayer they should leave our team in peace
The image of ty shaving his sack is giving me nightmares 😫😳
feels good to see the lads outside emirates again
Where's DT??
129m and nothing
I totally agree with Arsenal Fans to dismiss Mikel Arteta out to save Arsenal
And then what? Not many managers available. It won't be easy to get Conte.
Saliba couldn't do worst than Mari to be honest... And Torriera can't get into this team either. Clearly Arteta doesn't know what he's doing!?
It doesn't matter what manager is in there, plain and simple
Conti is not going to get what he wants if he joins Arsenal.
Where's DT?
The mistakes by Arteta are endless. PEA as club captain. Selling Emi Martinez. His treatment of Saliba. His treatment of Gendouzi. A new contract for Zhaka. Not buying Yves Bissouma. Not buying Houssem Aour. Not bringing in a striker. Not bringing in a RB The list goes on.  Shocking tactics that don’t suit the players. Total lack of direction. Players all over the place. Arteta must be the only person that didn’t know Chelsea would use wing backs to play with width.  How long until the people running the club can see that he is way out of his depth.  Shambles from top to bottom!
Re: claude... ahem " its time for him to go" fyi forest fan not got a point cant score goals... we need HELP too
If you perform like you have the first two games wednesday night the albion will slaughter you
Yay. Cant wait to play in the championship next season
Its true ethan ... its damn true they are light years away from winning league
Wenger out we want our Arsenal back Ahahahahahahahahahaha Karma
Dt missing  Troops missing  Moe missing  ARTETA _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
wow news
Anyone who bought the new kits are complete mugs hope you’re happy with the result
We’re still above all the championship sides
GOD BLESS 🙏🙌✝️!!!
SHOUT OUT TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT ARSENAL SUPPORTERS, BUT JUST COME HERE FOR GIGGLES. NEVER FAILS, THANKS AFTV. 🙌
Give Voldemort the Job!
21 year old kid 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣...whom dis guys are hyping for d last 2 years
Stockport on a Friday night😂😂
Where is DT
Ty: Alteast are 2nd second if you view the table downside up.
Robbie is so deluded he thinks the managers reputation is reset every season 😂😂 arsenal fans have had 18 months of misery and he’s saying already? 😂😂😂😂
Please where is DT
Don't ever give arteta a pass he choose these players to get when he could of got players that are somewhat proven already like isco, zakaria, asensio, and aouar if Norwich signed the players we got No1 would be talking about Norwich getting a top 4 finish
What happened to DT?
This is absolutely ridiculous fired the bastard mikel arteta period
LMAO you want a proper manager that would walk away if the club takes away his best players?......any manager with that kind of mentality knows it's not worth it to come to here.
To be fair, Arsenal played better than I expected
Where is dt?
This performance was worse than performance against the Bees. This team is negative. They are the most boring team in the league. Last season they were the most boring team in the top half.
Bring OZIL back so we’ll beat the big teams
Chances from corners...come on,man!
Where’s DT
Dan Potts in the background trying to compose himself before he chats to the Don
i agree with u Lee
I swear Lee was an extra in Lord of the Rings? I’m not mugging him off, he could make loads as an extra, plus they’d save on makeup and special effects.
Did anyone see that huge Arsenal fan making debut at AS Roma (as Arsenal didnt want him). Getting standing ovation from the Roma fans after 2 assists and bossing the match. But nah, Bamyangs good too.
This probably was a guy who said sack wenger also. Now look where they are
where's DT?
Lee is right! IT TIME TO GO!!!!
Good luck against us we dominated Blackburn hit the cross bar 4 times play high pressure football. You’ll get beaten
What happened to DT?
Nooo, trust the process! 💩
Kinda disagree with Lee here. Liverpool gave Harvey Elliot 90 minutes on saturday and he's 18. The difference is he was surrounded by senior players who are experienced and have leaders on the field.   Arsenal have no leaders on that pitch but being fair, Arsenal had 5 players (Gabriel, White, Odeguaard, Lacazette and Partey) unavailable for todays game. Against the 3rd best team in the league.
Arsenal's are for the most part their own worst enemy! They are gluttons for punishment! Every week some ? Is going to say give Arteta more time! Are you serious? Remember he's had almost two seasons, Arteta is S-h-i-t-e understand that. He ain't going to change anything progressively all your going to get is more of the same garbage. Arteta has to go NOW! Not next week, not next month, NOW!
On a positive note I really like the quality of the filming and audio ! Go see an interview from 2019 after this and see the difference
ROBBIE DEFINITELY TRUSTS THE PROCESS
Love how he says 'fans'
We never looked like scoring? That’s a LIE… Another series of overreaction. Saka lost focus of his defensive duties. No one is saying anything about it. Always descending on Arteta.
He won't resign 😄
At this point i wanna keep losing so that arteta gets sacked
I hope we get conte that would be great
Conte would never ever go to Arsenal he wouldn’t get along with the the players and the board he rejected Spurs for the same reason
Lee Judges is spot on. There's no identity, no system and no tactics. If we lose in the Carabao Cup to West Brom, seriously, Arteta should resign. He honestly cannot think he should stay after that.  Well done Lee & Don Robbie.
Arteta Out
Oh the days when we couldn't beat arsenal, no history lol
Lee's arms going up and down so much he could be on E's in the 90's...aceeeed aceeeeed
Mikel Arteta is terrible, he makes the whole Arsenal team look terrible. 😃
I think arsenals plan today was to not get pumped an tbh they didn’t do too bad.
Lee just pi55es me off. Blaming Arteta for things out of his control.
Ty: it started raining
Ole and arteta can book a hotel room and make love
Sambi, Smith-Rowe were great. Martinelli had a great engine but was chasing shadows. Saka did not cover Tierney when he was dropping in to cover Mari's inability to deal with Lukaku which made Tierney look bad. For me Tierney was trying to attack and defend the LB and LCB positions. Not fair on him to be called out. Leno to slow on the distribution as always. Pepe,Cedric,Saka,Mari, and maybe Xhaka not up to standard.
Every team is going to struggle against Lukaku this season
Robbie is Dt no longer on your channel?
Sad to see a club as big as Arsenal in such a state. I remember when Liverpool was the laughing stock of the league with hodgson at the helm😕 trust me it gets better! Just get rid of the deadwood players, poor management and useless owners, easier said than done but arsenal will be better for it
Makes a lot of valid points, stumbled across this video whilst falling down the rabbit hole of YouTube, as a Liverpool fan, we got to see the likes of Trent, Robertson and even established players like Fabinho bed into the side before being unleashed. Even now with the likes of Elliott & Curtis Jones, they get the odd game but 9/10, they’re rotation players given a sprinkling of game time to work on their craft. Arteta like Southgate has hung saka out to dry, lack of management skills from them both! Saka is an amazing talent but he’s still a kid, he needs someone to put an arm around him and help him keep his chin up
city game is the big one
Where’s kelechi and DT?
Man City will beat them 5-0. It will be Arsenal's worst ever start to a Premier league season.
Now that Lee has gone back to watching the game in the stadium, we no longer have the privilege of watching the legendary teeth grinder week in week out. 😢
Damn Lee Judge look like an alien or something lol
So he wins the FA cup and he’s a god, but he loses two games and now he needs to resign? Like I agree that he should probably go at this point, but I’m confused on the way some arsenal fans swing so hard
It's the first time in the premier league that Arsenal have lost our two opening games without scoring.Arteta seems to have a knack of collecting these kind of unwanted records.
Lukaku manscapped Mari
Why do you keep talking about chance. Chance is mean nothing. Every club can create chance dude. Defend is too bad. You always take everthing easy and make an excuse Arteta. Unacceptable
Tierney is at fault for both goals leaving oceans of space for Chelsea to exploit - why is he tucking in when there is cover already there?
36 games to go. Arteta might turn this around. Be patient.
Gabriel doesn't looks the same player..  Who scored goal against Chelsea year ago.
Ty we drew the second half
Nosferatu
Arteta has too much pride to leave on his own volition. You can see his stubbornness to recognize his mistakes and be accountable for his decisions when he does post games interviews.
Can someone check on DT, not heard from him in weeks.
Great result! I hope Arsenal get relegated, then the board might actually give a f
Still don't get the point of people paying for a ticket to go to watch Arsenal at the stadium.
NUFF RESPECT JUDGES  REAL TALK
Lee judges thanks for the word of advice... Arteta doesn't have tactics......he should pls resign
Sack Arteta and employ Conte. I am a Chelsea fan but I think you deserve better. We sacked Lampard and now look at us. So do it.
Arsenal is buying players for 2023/24
i dont know what arsenal fans see in martineli  edu said he's a wonder a kid and everyone believed him
Inter bought lakaku.  And Young and others lee.  Conte wouldn't touch arsenal.  Its in a mess and its a poisoned chalice
AFTV and Arsenal are shaving balls 😂😂😂
Is Arteta the Spanish love child of Stan kroenke? Arteta is so bad that u think he be gone ages ago. Arteta looks like a beaten man. He lacks confidence, and they should just put him out of his misery and sack him. We’ve had worst squad in the past than this. His tactics look so predictable. Job too big for him. We are only living in fools’ paradise if we think Arteta will turn things around.   Transfer window open. Sack the manager now so new manager can make use of the remaining open window to tilt the team a little bit.   If we wait till October, we gonna lose points and might as well write the season off.
GF. honey, have you seen my phone? ME. Same place where CHELSEA is GF. Where?????? ME. on top of the table!!!
Lokonga just runs about and has a terrible shot on him
Where is DT, does anybody know?
Shut up with this bullshit clickbait crap. Arteta is doing the best he can with the resources he has..give him some time and we’ll see..trust the process
Kieran Tierney is our most attacking threat. Any1 with a brain knows that's where the space is. Chelsea exploited that twice. But what's frightening is the fact the top clubs in last 5 odd years come to the Emirates and expect to win. We don't go to their grounds expecting to win.  What a change.
Proper bs from all at aftv again, what was it last year give martinelli balagon a chance now it's why there playing them please stop flip flopping
Imagine having to be drunk before watching your team play. Hard times for Arsenal
😂 its funny all the aftv clowns 🤡 back your manager
we cant even score ffs
Lee looks more and more like Gollum everyday
WE WANT ARTETA TO STAY AT LEAST 1 MORE SEASON
If Arsenal can’t sign conte that means we don’t want to improve.
Don Robbie's gonna be shooting these interviews in IMAX if Arteta stays for the whole season
Conte at arsenal ..... dream on . He wants total control and big budgets
As a Chelsea fan, I really feel sorry for this football club. The fans deserve beter.
Granit Xhaka is a passenger in the middle  Lakonga looks good him and Partey will be quality
City is coming for u guys, all the best
A fellow supporter said the following: "This current Arsenal team is dead bro" (Excluding Smith Rowe, Saka, Tierney and new signings Nuno and Sambi, Arteta and the owners are killing off the supporters liking of the club big time, I've decided to stop watching anymore matches for the rest of this season and just confine it down to watching Match Of the Day so I can endure watching the highlights. I cannot even begin to imagine what the Arsenal Amazon Prime documentary will be like.
Conte spent a lot at inter….
lmao
wer better than shitlsea
classic arsenal delusion. bro conte doesnt even know your club exists
Didn't know voldermort supported arsenal 🤔
It's not a Arteta fault,  you have deadwood and a difficult schedule to start the season. Unlucky so many pieces (first team players) were missing against Brentford and then City next, people say he spent 200m in the window but those in charge of transfer brought in more deadwood. Arteta is a scapegoat just like Moyes at United.  Hope he will be backed to continue.  He will get it right ✅
As a Spurs fan, I only watch AFTV when they lose, but Lee knows his stuff. Wish he was a Yid 😉🤣
I don’t even get surprised with this results anymore! Lol no tactics! Sad indeed, but hey one team is the champions of Europe, the other is a mid table team now. So here we go again, an other season, same old thing!
Central Cee looking a bit stressed
Arsenal fans who still back Arteta are probably the same little cowards who knifed Wenger and demanded he leave, even though he was keeping the club afloat. Pack of weirdos.
I unsubscribed because of the man scape promo. I don’t need to Ty shave an egg. That was disgusting.
This man is the only fella that talks sense on AFTV
Looking forward for sambi party and martin
Conte to Arsenal?! lmao
🤣🤣🤣🤣 this guy is funny....chelsea has made him mad
Defensive poor, midfielders lack quality just work horses, not one quality striker on the books , martinelli headless chicken. Lee we got no chance when you think Lokonga is best player , average.
Hi. Spot on Lee Lukaku ran 5 yards to dominate us and Martinelli ran 35 yards every time where’s the game plans, tactics and defending shapes….
Arteta out by Christmas  should  be out by tomorrow  along with the so called  owners
I think Arsenal will be in the bottom 3 after 10 PL Games
Uncle Fester is a proper mug, love to give that head a forearm  smash 😅😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
For anyone reading this outside UK. know that it's a cockney thing not to be able to complete a sentence.  North of Watford we talk proper
As usual arsenal fans blaming it on there manager typical 🤣 honestly if you think zidane or conte coming in will get you top four youve got another thing coming 🤣seriously tierney played awful 😂😂😂
Ty: Arteta is the greatest ever 39 year old Arsenal manager
Lee looking slimmer than usual, must be fasting for an Arsenal win
I'd love see Lee on main tv like sky or BT speaks loads more sense than the vast majority of the mainstream pundits
ITS TIME TO GOOOOO
Lee Judges AKA the most accurate and relatable guy on AFTV
Love listening to Lee
Wouldn't leave Arteta in charge of a crayon.
Arteta should go before  arsenal  get relegated  to championship  we saw the signs  for 2 years this man 👨is not upto the job
Never mind the top teams U  look at teams like Brighton , Southampton,  Villa,  Spurs etc they look like teams with a plan,  teams that are coached.  Arsenal look like there thrown out there
All Arsenal Fans have to accept the truth and reality of the situation: Bukayo Saka is CURSED!!!  Time to trade him and get that evil spirit out of the Emirates Stadium.
Shaving a kiwi,  ha ha ha,stop it
Wait till yous play us (United) easy 3 points for you there 😂 Then back to normal for Arsenal  Jokes aside Arsenal are one of the biggest clubs in the UK and in the world, seeing the situation you're in is shocking tbh, should be doing miles better and challenging for trophies. It's mad how y'all are coping with this shite it really is. Us protesting against glazers may have woke them up idk but you guys need to protest, it's kinda sad to see the state you are in right now.
Thank gawd someone speaks what we all think. Worried though,  Lee looks like he has lost weight worrying about this season.
We will come back.....support the team.....this is a good young Arsenal team.....they need time....trust on boys....they will come back
EVERYONE SUSCRIBE TO LEE JUDGES TV
Where is DT?
You’d think with Lord Voldemort in the crowd the arsewipes wouldn’t be that bad. Looks like he forgot his wand.
Chelsea was in trouble after hazard left, they invested properly unlike arsenal
Big Sam watching that match kicking his lips
So now its Arteta out, and Conte in... yeah right ok.  What could possibly go wrong....
Lee is the only one apart from claude rip who ever speak sense
All now me nuh see arsenal get a chance...stop chat rubbish Robbie
Lots of fan managers with Arsenal . Its good for banter and entertainment. No so good for Arsenal FC . Club needs more fans in the stand to make up for the lack of quality players. The 12th man every game.
He should have gone last season
U guys have the platform to help get rid of arteta n kronke ...protest is needed ...instead of jus looking for view try to help the club ..organize protest ...stop buying Jersey n ticket 's ..affect kronke pocket
Dun play tiernrey anymore🤣, then we will start getting clean sheet and scoring
TY: "It's not the players fault. Leno had to wear our yellow away kit today, due to a colour clash with the keepers jersey, so our players naturally assumed we were the away team and had to play with Chelsea, not against them!"
A rabble team, shud never have sacked Emery
sorry saka doesn't look good at the moment, no body strength, no end product made to looked like a boy
But y'all was the same set of people who say play the young players now y'all have a problem make up y'all mind na
It can only get better.... Can't it? 😊
A lot of people saying we were missing a few major players and using that to make excuses for the result when it wasn’t necessarily entirely the players’ fault (mind you, Mari’s defending is shocking) but more so, the so-called “system” arteta is deploying which leaves us extremely vulnerable in the full-back positions. I’ve had enough of this three at back “system” all so Tierney can push up and put a few unsuccessful crosses into the box. arteta out and let’s get in an actual proper manager with experience and at least an inch of some tactical awareness and tactical flexibility — the ability to know when to compromise on the preferred system and not try and force it all the time.
It appears Arsenal didn't know who they were playing against this weekend
Robbie keep saying Chelsea is the champion of Europe because they did the right thing at the right time. An experience manger can do something decent with this team. Arteta lack experience
Nah Arsenal are fully taking the pïss, I’m a arsenal member and the cheapest ticket I can find for the game vs Norwich is £130! That’s fully mocking it.
To make matters worse man city is next away in the premier league for Arsenal 😂 and then it's Norwich the  battle for 19th place lol
Thoughts and prayers for all the Arteta fans.  You are all brilliant.
City next 😂😂😂😂
Let’s not forget it’s been raining…so
Arteta forever arteta we trust. Championship here you go
The final nail in the coffin for Arteta was extending Xhaka's contract and giving him a pay rise.
Arsenal fan expectations: Antonio Conte *What will happen in reality* : Eddie Howe
Where the heck is DT?
🥳someone finally acknowledge tierney bad defending
Imagine spending 50 million quid on the lightweight Ben White. He doesn't get in to any decent team. Mari and Holding also terrible
The bloke doesn't know what he's talking, the bloke artea gave his instructions the players didn't carry out the plan. The players didn't want to know, that's all. He must be new to following football
Voldermott is an Arsenal fan. LOL
I don’t know what u guys expect from Arsenal now
Chelsea could’ve scored as many goals as Lee uses the word “like”😂
You act surprised but its not already  Robbie its 86 games not 2
They are simply better!!!!!!!!!!!!! Changing the manager will make no difference
Lee doesnt think conte had or would want transfer funds 🤣🤣🤣🤣
These clowns ain’t serious they all got latest arsenal tops on lol
ARTETA OUT
What a joke of a club Arsenal are😁😁
Get so drunk before the match Lee Judges will kill me with laugh kai Arsenal the new weeping boys of EPL,,
Serie a is different Lee, Conte just got in a bunch of finished premier league players on the cheap or for free and won the league in Italy. Imagine Ashley Young, Matteo Darmian ,Alexis Sanchez ,Vidal in the premier league, would get eaten alive. He'd need atleast 400m to turn that squad into a top 8 squad
Good luck for West Brom you’ll need it Arsenal, at this point your a shambles of a club 😂😂😂
Why you didn't get Benitez in I'll never know, he would set you up and be hard to beat and have a plan to play.
Nothing can come good of this club until Arteta is gone, it's just that simple.  ARTETA OUT
ARTETA OUT
ARTETA OUT
The guy with the beard behind lee is in his own little world
Those cameras!!!!! Peng
Has Ty been using the Manscaped trimmers up top? His brain is so smooth!... 🪒 🧠
Can we discuss why we cannot score after 4 match, 2 pre season match (lose 1-0 againts Chelsea and Tottenham) and 2 in Premier league (2-0 againts Chelsea and Brentford) ..i still don't get it why we buy cb.. where is Magalhaes and Saliba, Saliba didnt get any chance inthis team...and  why we didnt buy ST ...and we spent 100 million but no change at all.. Arteta out, edu out.
Where is DT?
Pepe is the reason why i would love to see asensio
Ty: there was rain and sun which confused our players
Arensal thinking you’re getting Conte 🤣 he’s never going to go to that joke of a club . No character, no leaders , no bottle , no talent . Nothing !
Let's agree 👍 Arsenal Fc fans time ,Mikeal Arteta Exits Arsenal Fc 👏
Robbie being serious artea shouldn't go fans like Robbie doesn't have a clue he Happy keep losing games
F AFTV
That’s what you fools wanted telling us to get rid of Wenger f u ol
Arsenal 1st prem team to not lose a game all season. Also 1st prem team to not win a game all season
Arsenal load of toss 🤣🤣 how you lot still think you have anything going is beyond me
LDLLLL Hibernian 2 - 1 Arsenal Rangers 2 - 2 Arsenal Arsenal 0 - 1 Chelsea Tottenham 1 - 0 Arsenal  Brentford 2 - 0 Arsenal Arsenal 0 - 2 Chelsea If you want to see Arsenal get relegated then trust the process. 🙈
You can get conte but he’ll walk away just like he did at inter
This man knows his stuff
Lee you are assuming that Arteta did not instruct Tierney  cover Mari with the treat of Lukaku.
Robbie & Dobby ha ha ha
No ultimatums please. Arsenal will always know how to shock us. Lets just let things run their course. The Cameras look great btw
Camera quality is impressive.
Get Ange postecoglu from celtic. He will make Arsenal better.
Where has DT gone?
I’ve clocked what Arteta is trying to do. By buying young players this lowers arsenal fan standard cus if we do loose/have bad season Pundits/Meida go “he’s got young players it’s only natural they loose, they need time”. It’s BS and manipulating the fans which is what Arsenal is all about now. Arsenal fans  need to wake up. Also their are still proven young players he could of signed - Maddison, Bissouma, Aouar, Lamptey etc
Not a single premier league game to be won in the first 5 fixtures. We're even going to lose to west brom
Conte save us please
We need a defensive MD an that's yves besouma.  I keeeeeeep saying this over an over.  We don't have good defensive MD qualitie player , like yves besouma
Arteta's tactics are as stiff and predictable as his hair piece.  Should be able to tailor his players to move better up top.
His squiggly lined vein :)))
I'm just glad Chelsea kept a clean sheet to give my fantasy points
Something wrong with the heading, it should be: Arteta should resign before he lose to West Brom.
Nice to see Wrotoeshaw make an appearance on the left at 6:35
These arsenal fans seem to think there just intitled to win you need to realise your a mid table club now up against the European champions I'm a Liverpool fan not a Chelsea one but fair is fair arsenal are no longer a feared club people no they are an easy 3 points
Nice to see Wrotoeshaw make an appearance on the left at 6:35
Arteta probably has defenders playing up front in training. Clueless Manager
Robbie is actually delusional
Lee makes the most sense when he speaks about Arsenal. Arsenal fans should be embarrassed when Ty speaks. The man is clueless and blinded by loyalty to Arteta
What's happened to dt. I want to laugh at him.
Chelsea  took arsenal kids to school
Arteta out its not only been 2 games its been 18 months of no style or substance in our football. Sack arteta now to save our season
Rob upgraded the visuals yeah????? oh aite.....
Lee Judges, the best analyser👍, our attackers do the work of  defenders
The judges 👀
Ty: this loss doesn't count in my book.
Nosferatu has spoken, mortals!
Lee “ya knat I mean like” Judges
If he goes, what do we do? Get Freddie back?
To be honest I watch the full game an if saka was tracking back an marking James this game would be a 0-0 draw cuz this both goals came from the left hand side of arsenal
Michael Essien just out of picture on the left trying to get a word in...
To be honest, after 5 games Arsenal should sack Arteta bring in an experienced manager kids are just running around like headless chicken totally poor tactics are hindering us
Why haven't Arsenal tried to buy M'Neil from Burnley he's got the legs and the class
Lee talks sense.
Why is DT not on this channel anymore?
against the owners but most arsenal fans buy the kit every year
Voldemort is looking like he lost one of his Horcruxes today after that performance from the Gunners
When are we getting relegated man, ffs can’t wait any more,let’s just get to the championship already cause that’s our level right now, Brentford showed us that
Sorry 😞Gunners. Tough times!!
If arsenal were a character in game of thrones it would be "Reek" ...
Look at the stats with ozil and without ozil
Some things aren't down to the manager. Nobody can argue that missing your 2 best strikers is an easy thing to cope with and the same can be said about partey and gabriel. You can also say the way we left business so late on players like odegaard and a replacement right back is not his fault. I will back Arteta for as long as he is at the club, but if he is replaced I won't mourn his departure, football is a harsh sport and managers get sacked but you move on.
Tired reading comments will continue again
Arsenal fans should be praying they lose v West Brom so they can focus on the Premier League. The big one is v Man City- that is bound to be another defeat- so 3 straight defeats at the start of the new campaign. Arteta should never have been given the job. I remember when they won the rubbish and now meaningless FA Cup and  deluded Arsenal fans thinking it was a turning point. Really do have some dumb fans.
Give it a few games and Lokonga will stoop down to the level of the team
Remember that all of this is being filmed for a poxy documentary that will serve nothing but to allow everyone to take the piss out of us lol 🤦‍♂️
Does winning the championship count nxt season?
Arsenal got rubbish players so is no way you can compete in the Premier against Liverpool, United, City, Chelsea, Tottenham...so no way they can compete at Champion League level... is nothing to do with the manager....you are so blind, is a team of losers because to lose is normal and acceptable...
Where's DT?
West Brom are a side that could beat Arsenal. Not really a fair ultimatum
Get Dean Smith - Experienced, steady and good at building hard to beat teams.
This is the 1st time in Arsenal history that they haven't scored a single goal in 2 opening matches since it was founded
We should of got Westergard for £15 million ben white is too small and light. broke a finge nail today and missed the match, partey is made of straw. we are royally fuckedfor another year.
this is my problem with the arsenal fan in England saying if he win westbrom he should resign what a joke🤣🤣🤣🤣
Arteta isnt a ready-made coach yet. But also when looking at Arsenal vs Chelsea, Chelsea are stronger in each position. So it's not an easy task either :p
Don’t worry he’ll win against Brom then City will smash you again 🤣
Get this man a mouthgaurd. He will not have any teeth left by the end of the season.
Man like voldermort talking sense.
I'm not an arsenal fan but I've watched AFTV for years and I'm really wishing I could hear what Claude had to say right now, RIP
It's still pre-season!!!!
No confidence in Arteta. I don't think the players are responding to him. He's an experiment rather then a top class manager.
Arsenal the highest net spenders.
Holding and Chamber, you couldn't write it. Football careers from nowhere
I want Arsenal to be the best side ever, just for these guys!
Emery got sacked for less arteta out
Next week he will meet with a hunger goals lioness
I promise i won’t clown arsenal anymore  Its actually hurting watching you guys play now  Praying for you guys man hoping arteta leaves and the real arsenal can come back
Ty: Thoughts and prayers go out to all of the dinosaurs who tragically lost their lives when the asteroid crashed into the earth.
Lee will have had more fun on the Irish Guy’s video than during the entire Arsenal season. Also, he has security around him now
Tierney was exposed by Havertz and James cause Saka wasn't tracking his man in James and it took Arteta too long to realise that and address it!
We hit rock bottom… we are dome! Arteta out!!!
Ty: “Listen, we are only six points back of the leaders, big improvement!”
He is saying about players tactics, but he forgot to say that there's no tactics from kids players
Laca out, Partey out, Gabriel out, White out, Saka not fit, Auba not fit....and still these Arsenal fans are talking as if they have a PSG Squad....wtf is wrong with this lot?...it was against Chelsea who spent nearly 300m pounds to assemble that squad, we are not even half of it...so this was more than expected
So Lee is saying Arsenal is turning their supporters to drink 😂😂😂
Look when you get an undercover  championship side like Arsenal to play what do you do ? You  beat them lmfao
Robbie sounding surprised that lee thinks he arteta needs to go is the problem with this fan base and the reason this club is dead
Arsenal kids players
Wheres DT he hasn't put anything on his own channel for a while
Big up Lee!👊
I don’t really think the West Brom game matters, the next league game is against Man City. If Arsenal lose to Man City then that’s 3 straight losses to start the season in the league, that’s a much bigger deal than the cup game against West Brom
Lee you’ve totally missed the mark on the conte point. Conte turned down Tottenham for the same reasons why he would turn down Arsenal. He got heavy investment when he first went to inter but due to the pandemic he was given nothing and lost two key players so he resigned. He doesn’t just want funds he wants a specific system and he would demand certain players which arsenal would not provide him.
He should have been sacked after the semi in the europa. Ridiculous.
The AFTV  fans got what they deserve going to the matche instead of the Protest lmao hahaha
Anyone knows where dt has gone
As a Spurs fan I’m loving it…….Spurs have me singing the blues, when Tottenham win and Arseholeanal loose, lol 😂
Disgrace everyone witch-hunting manager.  AFTV specialise in this.  It’s sickening.  Boy has 9 players out and they want blood.  Get behind him , the situation , the man and give youth a chance.   The  skinny kojak talks  a good talk but the manhunt is a disgrace e   9 players out
Should of never beeen there in thee 1st place
You lot think sacking another manager is going to solve your problems.  You escalated your clubs issue's by hounding Wenger out. The club sold the best players and replaced with Inferior one's, under him. The players you have now are vastly overated. Arteta may be stubborn by making those players play his way, but the rot is above him in suits.
if we can't win surely I will never ever look football
I am
Arteta out and stop using kids to prop us up ENOUGH IS ENOUGH LEE
Fun Facts: Walcott > Saka
Conte .....I have to laugh. He will want another 200M to spend. He left Inter because he wasnt backed by his board to invest.
Ain’t no good anymore
No dt?
Get back ozil
Look Rob Holding always misses  damn useless
In fairness to Lee he always talks a bit of sense.
Just remember everyone wenger out, all the fans that supported that deserve this, fools
"We could still be out there, we ain't gonna score!" 😂😂😂😂😂
Have to keep arteta, believe in the project.
Tactics wtf? Put Tuchel onto our bench instead of Arteta do anyone think that would make a difference. We had 5-6 first teamer out today. No one mentioned that. We dominated Chelsea as long as it was 0-0.
If you want artita out click like
If you want artita out click like
How long though genuinely will they have to say this though? He’s lost to everyone 😂😂 it’s always one more game. One more game.
"He's done it ogain tha fu**in Arteta"  🤣
First of all Gud Ebening,  200mil for who?  Pepe ain't worth 2 bob🤣 Wenger in!
Imagine Arteta at Chelsea, he would have been fired after first year
Conte never ever coming to the club if he is not going to get what he wants. Inter bought a lot of players for him, including Lukaku. You don't know what are you talking about. What Arsenal can buy for him???
Lol, ARTETA should be given a five year extension, best ARSEnal manager ever…. COYS
As Gary Neville said be careful what you wish for no European football
Where's DT?
This overweight apologist.
Where is dt been
Arsenal  must  get bissouma   to  Arsenal   now  he better  than  xhaka  100 percent
Agreed Lee you got it bang on we are crap and boring thanks arteta no game plan no nothing arteta out edu out
The Newcastle of the south. Large support, small talent.
Can u pls change the name of the team its not arsenal at all i never see like that before the worest arsenal
Get a job
Ol Voldemort talking nonsense. When conte went to internazionale they had Skriniar, De Vrij, Brozovic, Perisic, Handanovic. Baldy thinks Conte is going to be happy to inherit the likes of holding, el neny, xhaka, hector bellend, smith Rowe and overrated bi7ch boy saka? 😂
Robbie on your other video all the fans told you ARTETA OUT, WAS YOU NOT LISTENING , CLOWN
Ty: the boys played good but the weather was bad so it destroyed our plans.
ARSENAL IS DEAD BEFORE YOU GUYS  WANT  WENGER  OUT NOW YOU GUYS ARE EXPERIENCING THESAME THING LOL
No passion, no heart, no tactics, looks like no focus on proper fitness, no trust, no process. You're done here Arteta! Crack on
May I ask what’s happened to DT? Anyone?
This is the thing out strikers and wingers are too focused on defending that they can't attack freely, that's why we look toothless, we break and don't have anyone at the top end of the pitch, we also don't press as a unit we do it individually and get passed around easily.
My balls aint brown tho ??
Lee, spot on.
I had a great weekend, fantastic weekend and then at 430 it's doom n gloom 😂
Inter had proper players before Conte. I swear Arsenal fans are braindead saying arteta out, u will not go anywhere with another manager and these players, theres no on whos world class. Conte is good but with this squad forget it
Ty has a pink tattoo of arsene wenger on his arse
Arteta use 120m dollars but team is playing like championship
These people need to get real !!
It's early days, give Arteta some time to get his team organised. He can't be blamed for individual errors that cost you the game today. What was Tierney doing for the first?
Fair play Lee made some really good points there.
The arsenal Curse continues the more i think about it most of these so called chracters have serious mental issue
Out arteta unai emre is back
Ty: we lost because we were too busy giving Lukaku a welcome tour of the Emirates
he is on repeat. said the same last season
Arsenal wins against west brom and guarantee you, all Arsenal fans will forget these rants about Arteta out.
I got good odds on arteta and Bruce to be first to go
lee is so deluded. conte? this is 2021 Arsenal, Lee showing his age.
these lot claim they have the best fan base in the world lmao
Why is nobody mentioning the fact Chelsea fans booed SAKA?????
Big up the judge
Arteta should go
Torreira should have played today
*waffle intensifies*
Not sure what’s going on but sounds like you all sold out.
So everyone is gonna blame Tierney cuz he's doin wat the manager ask him to do........ok Have anyone seen in arsenal training defensive duties....ok....btw I think the fully fit squad would've been worse
Camera quality here is amazing
Arteta should have gone last year.
Lee you are absolutely right!! But Saka did not track on two goals.... Arteta has to go!! Bring Wenger back
Arteta, needs to be sacked if we want to win another damn Football match!
Where's DT gone ??
Agree with Lee
arteta is not a coach...he never was one..
Utd fan here.... the only difference I see between us and you lot is the fact we got better players. That's it. Our manager is just as useless
The last elite talent brought to the club was a receding Mesut Ozil 8 years ago. Can't remodel the club without elite talent and when every major European club brings talent in, Arsenal are left delving with mediocrity. Such a shame what the club came to be and how the Kroenkes degraded it.
Robbie is starting to piss me off when he thinks sacking him if we lose to west brom is wrong. Ik he's playing devils advocate but it's jarring now
look how newcastle fans feel arsenal fans are a joke moan at everything :L
Lee...😂😂😂😂
Arteta out!!
Bar Lukaku we beat this team 3 times on the trot, when Fat Frank  was manager. Our problem is the Manager!
They say you learn more from losing than winning, however the issue with Arsenal is they are not learning from any defeats.
No excuse for this one, Arteta look clueless right now. Anticipate nine point lost, what next????? These senior players are enemy to Arteta.
All I can say is, trust the process
wheres DT
Lee's 💯 Per Cent Correct...We Need Arteta to Leave Our Club Now!!!!!?
Hey look on the bright side guys we gonna score loads of goals in the next training  video
Where is DT?
Arteta should be sacked now
Artata out kroenke out edu out
As always, facts from The Judge.
Arsenal will be in danger this year!
Robbie and Lee look like they both have been Manscaped…
Only person on this channel that speaks the truth rather than putting on some deluded performance for the camera. Respect Lee.
Robbie saying already like the clown hasn’t already fucked us?
Well, they’ve got their Arsenal back 😂
Conte would not come near a club like Arsenal :(
The Judge's new fav word is "like"
Areta's Arsenal will always be outclassed, what do expect from a team managed by someone who is only good in polishing Pep's shoes at the Etihad?
Lokonga Better than all our CM's and DM's except for Partey: Sign  Bissouma to improve our midfield.Sign Matured players (men) we are being bullied every  where by everyone  because we are  Boys Arsenal FC or Bullied Boys FC... transfer window stll open;is it an Arteta problem or Kroenke problem introspect before  answering  wisely🤔. Reality Kroenke era has really  downgraded us.🏟
Arsenal will beat us as we will put out a z team as unlike arsenal we have more pressing concerns in winning the league
A. Arsenal can't afford Conte. B. He would NOT come to Arsenal...he goes to winners and not construction projects :)    -Carefree!
I hope Lee’s invested in a reliable gumshield for this season if he wants to keep them teeth! Loves a grind the fella
Great interview from Voldemort!
There is more chance Sam Alladyce becoming the next Barcelona manager than Conte going to Arsenal!!!
Oh dear. Ha ha he hee ha ha. Up the Chelsea 🇬🇧☠.
Keep the faith because things can only get better.
Tacticaly Lee is spot on....give him the Job.
Yes the big clubs bring in their youngsters more as of a luxury. Arsenal NEED them to stay afloat
Lee is a sound bloke
Where is DT ?
Continue making excuses for a bogus manager and Arsenal shall be back to being small
Same old arsenal,players running around confused cant even get a single goal.Arteta should not be at arsenal period,before the 90th minute he couldnt even watch,makes me sick how the same  players are receiving new contracts
I didn't think Arsenal were that bad. Just second best but had chances. The end of the day the team isn't as good as Chelsea.
Ty : Cheer up, Lee, we are only 40 points from safety.
Where is Arteta’s attorney?
They will tell us believe in the process and after losing that key players are not Available They will be looking for an excuse this guy is not just Capable for Arsenal Arteta Out
Honestly Robbie and his "already" and "serious". Are you kidding me
Somebody get this video to Antonio Conte! Especially the part where his speaking of Conte asap
Tierney is to blame for both goals, he left far too much space for James to exploit.
The Judge should be our representative if the Arsenal allow a fan on the board. 👍
Guys as a Chelsea fan I am admitting this game was not bad while you did not have any formidable forwards,remember you beat us 3 times back to back.
Saul niguez would be perfect alongside partey
Lee finally right about tactics… lets go back to the basics. Let defenders defend and strikers try to score it would take a lot of pressure off the people we need running towards oppositions goals, not ours!
Guys what happened to DT haven't watched AFTV in a while?
it’s honestly sad at this point
Anthonio Conte would use 130 million properly Robbie
What happened with DT?
My mate ty won’t be  happy
Conte will never go to Arsenal
no game plan to big for his boots this job
TY, we would have won if it didn't start to rain
Why won't he play buendia
I am a Liverpool fan but I actually am afraid of arsenal getting relegated
aftv is so reactionary it's actually insane, I guess that's what gets views though
Lee looks perfect lord voldermot !!
ARTETA OUT
The only verdict that matters, the judge
Asking kids to take this massive club forward, ffs
Lee…conte was happy with inter because they had is favourite players, hence why he didn’t spend, what do you think he will want to do at arsenal when he finds he has none of the players he requires??
Voldemort should just meet with Arteta and simply "Avada kedavra" him
A proper manager would get way more out of these players arteta has no style of play no tactics im beginning to feel sorry for him
Wenger In.
"Chelsea r a very very good side, champions of Europe"........ Brentford ain't.
readying themselves for the super league
We went for a total novice and errors/mistakes would have been expected along the way. What LJ calls excuses are reasons, so far this season as far as I am concerned. Arteta came into a club that has been in decline for over a decade. More experienced managers would have struggled (as did Emery). Allow Arteta to learn and improve his decision making and the support should keep things in perspective. I would also disagree with LJ that Lokonga was the only positive. ESR showed many times during the game that he is already a class act and will be a world class player. When we get a settled White alongside Gabriel, Lokonga beside Partey, ESM in tandem with Odegaard we will be a different proposition entirely. kroenke out not Arteta
Lee judges speaks the most sense.... Arsenal will do well to finish in the top 10
I believe saka will go soon
Arteta 4eva
Someone please explain to me what major club would hire Arteta at this exact moment if he left Arsenal? The answer is none. He is inexperienced and cannot manage this team
Who got all these people to represent AFC... it's crazyyyyy
Arsenal are not a small club. I don’t support Arsenal but have a lot of respect for them and the fans. Loads of bell end city fans who have been good since 2013
Arteta has to go!! Had enough of his woeful tactics since last season. The job's too big for him.
My dad said only 2 nil
Wake up Robbie.....Arteta should go now.
Lee isn't angry anymore which is abit worrying coz loosing has become normal now
Your better than that lee, thinking conte would ever take up the Arsenal job. That's delusion at its finest. But I feel your pain, it messes your brain up lol
We’ll win the league while you go down with Norwich. Life’s great! 😎
Has TY been promoted?  Shaving kiwi 🥝 balls is a top job.
Inter spent massive for conte what is Lee smoking
The only one who speaks sense, big up lee judges!
Arteta is damaging his legacy every time he manages a game. The next lampard if you ask me.🤷🏽‍♀️
Arsenal players don’t need manscape   Because it was men’s against boys today
Delusional RObbie I guess pre season does not count thats what you kept saying all pre season now look at how unprepared this team is.
it's so easy to just blame it all on the manager isn't it? every fan that thinks arteta is the problem needs to go and get themselfs checked. losers
It was not that Painfull loosing to chelesa bt for how long are we going to continuing loosing...
Lee is a credit to this channel ..speaks from the heart
ARSENAL FANS WENT TO THE MATCH JUST TO WATCH LUKAKU SCORE 😂.
Where’s DT...
AR TAT TERED
We looked awefull today
All mouth you Arsenal fans hi stop going 2 years ago and giving up my season ticket
The problem isn’t the manager it’s the club and the owners
After the game....... Sambi - Hey Lukaku great game bro  Lukaku -  Thanks bro an keep it up your one of the better players if not the best one today for your team.
Thumbnail on the right show Gnarby scoring twice for Bayern 😂😂😂
But our women team is doing very well🤣🤣🤣
Robbie is arteta in till this channel reaches 2 mil subscribers
Lee,   do ur own channel, ur better than aftv,     ur the only non manchild on that shitty poison channel
ARSENAL HAVE NOT BEEN ORGANISED FOR THE PAST 15YRS
Arteta 💯🗑
Small banter club🤣🤣
Voldemort
Like you know
If Chelsea didn't come out in the second half Arsenal won't even score
ARSENAL IS.A JOKE OF A FOOTBALL CLUB AND IT AINT EVEN FUNNY ANYMORE
Smith Rowe shoulda gone to Villa🤣
What camera are they using now? Picture looks great now
WHY wait will after the West Brom game? Let's simply SACK Arteta tomorrow morning, so that Conte can be in place for when we play City, and can bring in the right KEY signings in time before the Transfer Deadline!
This guy always makes the most sense to me
Let's try to get 9 of the first 11 back before we judge to harshly
Lmao Dan Potts standing there in the background making sure he is on camera
Pathetic arsenal supporters judge the team when all players are fit and the transfer window is closed.
sad really sad
Sorry Lee lad but none of your players would get on our bench, youngsters or experienced players😂😂😂
What has happened with dt?
Whats this “start of season” finished 8th twice.
Hope Josh Kroenke was in the Stadium to hand Arteta after the game a cheque of £500 mil to buy better players since the ones on the pitch are  not doing the job at hand
Smith rowe chance..?? when azpi block it..? ppfftt naaah..
Lokonga came from Anderlecht and Arteta threw him straight in the deep end into the first team and over the past 2 games he’s been arsenals best player for me. If only he had the same faith in Saliba.
Tbh Arsenal shouldn’t expect to beat Chelsea, Liverpool, ManCity or ManUnited yet, they are a project
Lee is spot on
Infairness to Arteta, he's playing the young players now so when they leave on a free in 2 years, they'll have plenty of first team experience.
We had couple chances are u serious Robbie kmt at this level of football any team has chances wen will u wake up and smell the coffee and sorry I don't see how xhaka and sambi is good enough to play for this club we are going backwards
As poor as Arsenal are at the moment a few of the youngsters do look good, problem for Arsenal is if they get very good they'll be gone haha
At least AFTV content, is lit. once plus.
We helped Brentford create history, and now we've helped Lukaku with his debut goal for Chelsea. We're the gift that keeps on giving.
Put it in facts   180min  Total so far  4 goals  Conceded  0 goals scored  Home and away defeat   What have we really learned ? Management has not been great we have to be fair. I'm worried about the west brom game   By September we will only be left in FA cup and go through the motions in the league   Frightening times to be an arsenal fan
Just look at Arteta's right hand men and you'll know we are going nowhere.
Let's be real - we just played the UCL champs with one of the best strikers in Europe leading their line. We kept it close and could have nicked one 2nd half. A lot of teams will get battered by Chelsea this season, but at least we will be able to look back and say we were competitive today. On another day we may have got a 2-2, who knows? Leno was at fault for both goals too tbh. We desperately need a new keeper and should try and get Pep (or Conte, Poch, Zidane) in the summer to help Arteta transition. We should forget Allegri tbh b/c Juve have no competition anymore (and he will look way better than he is in Italy this season).
Lord Voldemort is angry.
what's the average IQ of an arsenal fan? same size as their show. can you not say anything apart from this or that mgr out...not once have i heard you call out the current ceo - also it's a project, like whem saf joined utd. patience needed
I think it’s clear Robbie is letting outside pressure from big media outlets, to try and be more positive, to balance out the doom and gloom. Stick to your guns Robbie and post and say what you want with your platform. Forget the idiots who criticise you, and call things as you see it.
You should seek advice from a medical professional....... You've "lost the plot" mate....
Arteta is inexperienced. Perhaps he will be a brilliant manager in years to come but we don’t have that time. Arsenal has become a joke. We need a legit manager.
TIME TO BRING OUT THE BANNERS !!!
More and more Lee's trying to be more objective when he's looking at Arsenal, and like neutrals, he's seeing nothing to suggest they're gonna be anything like ok this season.
I did not see it
Just to correct Lee... Inter gave Conte £150m to spend smh.
Robbie... You serious??  Like it's Artetas 5th game in charge! This is his 3rd season!
Where is DT ?
Just to think we pushed out Wenger and sacked Emery for this clueless idiot Arteta im 100% sure he will end up getting us relegated
He's got to go
Arsenal have a cone man in charge... shambles
Lee is good, but too bad DT or Troopz aren't available right now. the views would explode.
Voldemort doesnt look happy
Arteta will ruin himself with this team like Neville with Valencia!
Arteta should never have been appointed absolute clown
yo what happened to DT
It's hard to say it because Arteta is such a good guy, but man he is clueless! He never really had a team to work with but he never showed anything particular to promise a glimpse of hope for the future.
Arsenal (we) have to realise that we’re not a top flight side we are a mid table side with dreams of winning the league we are poor.
Where is dt?
What's that wasteman doing at the back?
The gift that keeps on giving, 🤡 fc
Totally forgot Arsenal have to play in the second round of the carabao cup now 😂
Two seasons in a row we finish 8th, and there are people still backing Arteta?   The delusion is over the top. Someone wake me up.
He be gone after arsenal lose Norwich
It's rarely even fun to watch anymore, It's almost depressing - Poor lad is gutted and he only has few more weeks of summer holiday
That what we call being loyal. Its lifetime contrat, nice to see his commitment. Arsenal is not anymore the club we knew, its sad.
Pepe is a flop.   £72 million. 3rd season and man is reluctant and disappears.
Voldemort gonna call for Potter for Arsenal manager
Despite arsenal losing I always love watching the interviews and see reactions lol from a United fan
Diego Simeone? He's the man 4 me.
Lee is the interview you wait for now Claude and Dt arent around
If u give Arteta Messi and Ronaldo he will still play his negative tactics
Aaron Ramsdale behind Robbie chilling 🤣🤣🤣
Pretty sure he has it wrong about Inter and Conte
Problem is Arsenal appointed a pub league manager Robbie...... please stop the excuses now and wake up mate!
@5:51 guy cleaning his nails is class
" No points, no goals and no hope". Nothing or Nothing coming 2022 on Amazon
Arsenal fans just need to realize that Tierney isn’t as good as they think he is
SOME COACH , MAKE ME LAUGH
Lose to west brom he is gone. The judge has spoken!!!
The only man and i mean a proper man on AFTV to talk sense.
Dobbie is right
Lost all respect for this dick when he didn't cheer when Harry Kane scored for England, says alot about him.
ARSENAL FANS blame everything under the sun accept taking responsibility allowing the club to go down under their fanship. They rather play the " I told you so" game and attack each other and wave at each other on fam cams. Its easier to talk behind the camera for views.
Conte was literally promised a fortune
Banter fc
Everyone was screaming for Martnelli to start towards the end of last season.  He started the first 2 games this season and he hasn't been impressive at all. Just maybe Arteta was right to hold him back.
I dont understand why our striker isn't on the halfway line when the opposition has the ball in our half. Martinelli was 20 yards inside our own half. How can we spring any sort of counter attack from so  deep?
Training session for chelsea
Man he's looking like Voldemort more then Voldemort each passing day.
Lokonga was the reason both goals were scored last week vs. Brentford and today vs. Chelsea he was not that good. Maybe average if you have Arsenal glasses.   You’ve got a very good talent in Lokonga and all this overhyping of him and in the near future he’s going to start getting criticized because yall expect something that he’s actually not doing right now.   Give him time. I think it was a great signing but he needs time.
Has dt left
IT IS NOT THE KIDDS MATE. CHECK AJAX. IT THE MANAGER AND WE HAVE NONE.
All arsenal players not enough fit to play football that is it blud
LUKAKU BOLINGOLI SMOKING PABLO MARI PACK 🚬🔥
How can anyone defend Arteta? He is the worst manager I've ever seen in my life
Sambi looks good.
stop make exuse young kid only saka 19 chelsea also young same as arsenal but they are better
If anyone is thinking the kroenkes care because they came down from their ivory tower just remember we have a camera crew following everyone around for the Amazon document!! They want exposure and for it to seem like they are involved!! Simple!!!
Supporting Arsenal isn´t good for your mental health.
HOLDING MISSED NOT BECAUSE HE IS A CH BUT BECAUSE HE HAS NO CLUE AND NOT A PL PLAYER. THAT IS WHY WE ARE WHERE WE ARE.
Been away from AFTV for a while...where is DT?
What happened to DT?
Jolly up 😂
MEN RESIGN. DI...DS GET SACKED OR WILL DIE BRING YOU DOWN.
WHERE'S DT?
There’s a real problem of coordination between the defence and the defensive midfield, it literally takes no more than 2 passes to bypass the whole of our midfield
What about resigning now? You are an absolute clown Lee Judges. Getting gassed about Grealish signing are we? Muppet.
TY: the players were distracted by the fans and the players couldn’t hear eachother
Ty: Arsenal and Man City both lost to Chelsea so that means we're as good as Man City
Conte 🤣🤣🤣 he wouldn’t join banter fc
Here we go sports fans.....the main event! 🍿🍿
Only positive things is AFTV getting sponsors more and more.
The difference between Arsenal and Chelsea.....the owner....Roman doesn’t muck about and he’s proved to be right 9/10.
ARTETA OUT!....His out of ideas!!!
"Conte wasn't given  fortune" ? 🙃He basically signed half a team ffs!
Bring Ty on so we can have a good laugh after another disgrace of a defeat...  MAKE IT HAPPEN ROBBIE!!!
There's a better chance of Lee's and Robbie's hair growing back than Arsenal winning the league again
Really pissed off. Bet £10 on 3nil [16.1], and £10 on 4nil]40-1]-gooners cant even win a bet for me.
State club is in Conte won't go near job it's a mess
We are the only team in the world who could spend £130 million and not improve at all
Arteya won't resign. His dead man walking it's not if but when his sacked he can't turn it round jobs to big for him.
Thomas Tuchel schooled Mikel Arteta, taking advantage of Arsenal's desire to overload the left wing going forward; Chelsea targeted that side of the pitch repeatedly, leading to a goal and assist for Reece James, who consistently found himself with acres of space in the first half.
Poor need change even spurs got rid of Jose. Won their 2 games and look defensive solid under Nuno and have done that without Kane.
Ty "We lost because our players don't use Manscaped"
Ty to chain himself to the stadium till wenger is reinstated as manager
Ty: I'm positive because next season we can go away to Peterborough United, which we have never been too before
lee top spot onnn those boys must play in the under 23 please
The Judge is always spot on!!!
Lokonga looks like a real wonderkid 🔥
I love listening to Lee !
Robbie defo has a relationship with Arteta
Robbie wants arteta to stay because he will get more views, I’m starting to belive ray was right
Your dreaming Lee. He won’t resign and he won’t be sacked. It’s a long term project , we are buying young and building for the future. We won’t spend 100 million on a single player , pockets not deep enough.  I am just as pissed as you are and question our manager but to think he should resign is naive I think.
Where is dt lol
Whether Arteta is good or not, I’d say he should be allowed to try at least 3 matches beyond the Man City game.  Signings should have come in earlier as well.
Arteta out 😡 no tactics and the players are looking like they don't understand him in training what he explains to them to practice it's not acceptable this is The Gunners please 💕
Please let us beat West Brom. Even if it’s the only win of the season 😭😩
LV GENERAL OUT!!!!!! RUINED THE WATCH ALONG,  JUST MADE A BANG OF NOISE LIKE HES HAD TOO MUCH HARIBO!!!!! PLEASE DONT MAKE HIM A REGULAR ON HERE ROBBIE MAAAAANNNN I BEG
Arteta isn’t good enough period There are many teams that are not in top six or with our resources that are playing better than us and that’s why every Arsenal fan should be worried.  Arteta is using Arsenal to learn coaching! Better coaches have been sacked for less in ambitious clubs!!!
Why is it unlisted all of a sudden?
Lee is by far the best aftv member
Please guys let’s be honest we need players. I stop watching football because of arsenal
The only pressing Lee is seeing is in his shop
Always sad to see the underdogs lose go blues💙💙
the enemy of the Arsenal football club is the fans they pay for ticket and attend  every match they support the owner not the team
Romelu keeping up his record of scoring against the small clubs
If you think you can get Conte, you're more deluded than Ty
Arsenal: Tierney is our best in form player Tuchel: Hold my trophy
Neutral here, I wonder why Arteta did not start Auba and why Lacazette isn't playing? Is he injured or something?
Speaking facts about Saka
west brom are brilliant at set pieces and long throw ins so you can guarantee an arsenal loss
Lee is a gun 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻always talking seance
Seeing so many delusional arsenal fans in east london ( not lee but others ) just makes it clear how much of a mess Arsenal  has become. Arsenal should be competing every year but they have become an embarassment to themselves and to everyone else. Fans like Julian and TY are absolultely delusional and this is coming from a chelsea fan.
Tomorrow we want arteta out!! Bullshit formation!!
Ty: We lost because the players were still feeling the pain of being stung by a swarm of bees last week.
Is he actually suggesting that defenders only defend, and attackers only attack? Or is he just trying to score some cheap points to sound like he understands the depth of the tactical issues Arteta is facing?
The memes will never end.
It seems Lee's anger management lessons have paid off
Been waiting for the judge
Even lord voldermot wand couldn't save arsenal, their absolute garbage.
where is dt?
Lololol Arteta dead
'We could still be out there now and we were never gonna score' 😂😂😂😂 Jesus Christ
Poor Lee just received his A-Level results and now he has to put up with this 😔
Court is in session
It was boys against men today. A wise man once said “it’s time to go”
it’s arsenal get used to it ur rivals are west brom
Arteta might not be the only issue. But nothing warrants him staying
Arteta looks like a substitute PE teacher who looks like he’s out of is depth
Arteta is an elite manager, those doubting him haven’t a clue.
THIS IS WHAT IM HERE FOR!
TY: at least we drew the 2nd half
To be fair chelsea would have beat 17 out if 19 teams today and you aint winning at city I feel for arteta not got his strongest team him yet but he has to beat norwich or its curtains
Conte in
Hi
Why West brom. Sack him now in order to save your club. You aren't going to win with him. You are 19th. This is the reality.
That’s me depressed for another week now…😩
Been waiting for this 🍺
Give us ty I need to know he’s still alive after another embarrassment
It was raining and the sun was in Leno's eyes- Ty
Just waiting for Taiwoo interview
AFTV brings a tear to my eye
Ty: We lost because the team insisted they were playing 11 girls named Chelsea.
As an Arsenal fan I'm disgusted by your comment. In all my years as football and Arsenal fan I've never seen a coach tactically better than Mikel Arteta and I think he's the best coach we ever have had. Back him and trust the process. We can still do this! We are Arsenal! COYG!
TO 45000 FANS THAT WENT TO THE GAME AND NOT THE PROTEST, THIS IS WHAT YOU DESERVE, YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM
finally we get some sense
Lets go
