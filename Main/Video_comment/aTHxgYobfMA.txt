Song seriously hits different
No guns, no flexing, just a father speaking to his daughter.
The fact that he was put in the position and decided to make this song is......its just so wrong that our society has chosen to allow a parent to keep a child away from a loving parents, is just so wrong.

im ngl this will forever be a famous song bc imagine in 14-15 years he say to his daughter  "Here you go you need to learn a lesson" and then turn this song on. Then he say " See so stop saying Ian there for you or haven't been there for you."
This is just heartbreaking I love NLE he’s so cool a good dad and makes good music ❤(srry I texted this lat ❤)

I feel the words you say at 11 years old cause I grew up without a dad
You made this the day before my birthday
NLE I’m sorry to hear that ur grandma passed away I know I’m late but it is my first time under standing the song I’m only 12 right now and I was 9 when this song came out so I’m super sorry and just keep doing what ur doing and tell your self what u are doing is for her❤❤❤ hope u can read this. 😊😊😊
That is me and my dad. He has a son and that I never met a day in my life and he keep on court for not saying then he gotta adopt his own child and not so I’m gonna try to help you out but if I know something, I will tell you about it.
I wish my dad was like this❤
My dad going thru the same thing 😔
best song you put out g
Who here in 2024 feeling every word🤦🏾
Just had a son and I’m 16 my bm mother and father won’t let me see my son and this song is the only thing keeping me together.
Influenced by Don Trip💯🔥
Man nle I feel this personally because this is happening with my parents and I hardly get to see my dad and now its hard dang I'm a play kid from Memphis and  I'm going to show my stuff now
Damn choppa I know I’m not the only one going through this same but it still feel like I am you hit home on this one brudda she will see this and know one day your a true G and stand on it and you will have the chance to be the father  she needs!!!! I do the same only thing my son knows I am and always will fight for him this song just strengthens my  sole as a father and confirms that I’m doing the right thing and in gods time I will have my son just as you will with  your daughter!!!!
I have the same situation man with my son shit crazy been fighting a case for 5 years relate to every word
This shit got me crying because most fathers a perfect but mom wanna be weird and take away the kids because they think they know better I know this because my mom and my dad are going through court and shit and like he said had a daughter to have someone to live for because without her this nigga would be in jail or dead so he trying to be the thing her mom isn’t support so when he say he will do something and has done it it’s for his daughter and it’s not even funny you know how many fathers have to go through this just to see a THEIR CHILD ITS TO FUCKING CRAZY and people say that moms are better than fathers but that’s so fucking wrong because we all know that if he had custody of her ain’t no child support just the child’s support that’s it and that’s all period.

said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever record, yeah (you're so lazy) Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Ayy In the back of the Rolls-Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls-Royce carseat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish? Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep, wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you
I feel it bro

This blk Queen has seen it all too often, and it's sad for the children, families, and creates brokenness and trauma. Shame on America. We can do better, everyone can. Healthy relationships matter. Blessings🖤

Please no pitty for a G
bro his baby momma and him they probly wrok things out so he dont ut his hands on his baby momam
I’ll say it ONE MORE TIME!!  I Need Everyone to understand this is way to common in our society with in these newer generation wanna be MOTHERS!  An I say that to say.. A real mother to me is “ A mother who makes sure there Child/baby wants for nothing & never puts her needs before their own children’s.  Our child’s happiness and mental wellbeing, health & mental happiness is above all. An a  fathers absence in a child’s life can be the most significant part of our children  mental wellbeing.   Both our baby girls and boys father bond between them is so special and important for them to have.   Children need there mother for life lessons that only mom being there can help with. A there are life lessons that they will need only their father for.   So please understand our children need both parents in their life and making sure your baby has that opportunity to make that bond, is all I’m asking for.   Regardless of the grown up problems you might be going through with the other parent.   Let it be there choice in the end of what that might look like to them down the road, just let it be there choose of what that bond or friendship might look like.   It’s not up to us mothers to decided if there father can be in there life or not, that is a 100% the child’s decision. So put your bitter feelings aside and put your child’s happiness and wellbeing first & foremost.
You are beyond an amazing father!! Your love for your baby girl in this song/ video shows so beautifully, Your mother did a wonderful job raising her son.    It really hurts my heart she would really take her baby girls love & need for her father away because she’s selfish.  Use women/single mothers really need to open their eyes and see that there only hurting the child in the end, a baby girl needs there fathers love. A father, daughter bond is something that is so precious and important for them.   Let these fathers who really wanna be in there Child’s life!! Let them!! It dose not feel good watching your baby grow up asking why there dad doesn’t love them!   I would do anything for my baby to have his father in his life!  His bad made his own decision and he chose not to be there or in his son’s life unless it benefits him.. in 6 years he has not attended not one birthday! Was  not there when I gave birth, & been in an out his life his whole life.   He Only spent altogether in his whole life, probably has only seen his son in person a total of 25 times in years and have not seen him or talk to him, going on 2 years.   Please let the fathers who are there and want to be there for there baby’s!! Be there let them be apart for there like just as much as you, the mother is. That baby’s is 50% month & 50%Father & shit sometimes even more father lol.. Dont be the reason your children have a em😅spot in there heart and life, A mess up and try to fill that empty space with someone or something that could take your child from you.  Get your ego out your ass and let go of whatever the BSi is and do it for the children not yourself!!
I first wanted to say you are such an amazing person/artist and it’s shows right here. Letting us your fans be apart of a real close to heart personal life journey you’re going through.   Your Opening so many other peoples eyes & showing them, there really is 2 sides to every story. I know these last couple generations have some bitter babies momma & is using the child as leverage or punishment in the way of keeping the child from the father.   There Out here making it impossible for the father to see their child because they mad at the daddy for some stupid shit the baby has nothing to do with.
Ik ben 17 met tweeling

Now I’m in civil court trying to fight for spending more than 8 hours a week with my daughter
I really respect this man only 21 and still trying to be involved in a family…. Keep up the grind choppa💪

Keep fighting for you kid nle copper
Yo nle Choppa can u let me be in one of your music videos
nle this hits hard
Feeling like a trans- parents
This video is quite disturbing. Self snitching maybe? Also gang gesticulations and Pulling a weapon on Mariahs step dad. 🤔 Yeah there's a reason you were arrested. YOU DON'T have to be raised NOT to hit women... To hit women Mr tough guy. You wanted her to be a "G" THIS Song CLEARLY describes why you weren't allowed around your daughter. YOU put the cops on YOURSELF.
parental alienation doesn't care if your're rich or poor it affects everyone. glad to see someone in the spotlight talk about it
he 30 in 2023
I arggy
This song really bring tears to me I feel every word
it is the realest shit you ever wrote

yo NLE is tha goat a real G
I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever record, yeah (you're so lazy) Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Ayy In the back of the Rolls-Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls-Royce carseat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish? Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep, wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you

I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever record, yeah (you're so lazy) Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Ayy In the back of the Rolls-Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls-Royce carseat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish? Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep, wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you

I never listened to this dude before but this song gives me a whole new respect. I was drug through the mud by my Bm but kept on fighting she tried all the stuff he said happened to him and after almost three years I finally got my sue and got my 50 percent custody. You just gotta keep going. Now the judge is finally seeing all the stuff I was trying to say about her mom and I never wanted it to be that way in the first place I just wanted to be a father to my daughter.
I’m so sorry for ur loss man may ur grandma R.I.P man so sorry bro my great grandma didn’t get see me she died when I was born😞😥

I pray that I raised my sons that good that they’ll care for their kids ❤
He made this 1 day before my birthday
Felt this one. Wild how our daughters names are the same just spelt different
His daughter will always thank him for what he can and has done for her. In my opinion he's one of the greatest fathers, even if he does mess up a lot.
Love this shit ... A$AP ROCKY be straight slayin' the game, no doubt! *AUTHENTIC VIEWS* gave him a boost, but his raw talent remains unchanged. He's holdin' it down like a true boss! Drop a thumbs up if you're vibin' with it, fam!
0:36
He's ahead of his years 👏🏽👏🏽
This is sad as a women I could never keep my children away from there father y’all gotta realize y’all hurting y’all kids especially for the men who really want to be there for there children

She fake don’t worry about her
Yo NLE have you been able to see your daughter anytime this year and I feel bad for you have been going through and I just want to tell you that I hope you get through it
Goosebumps
This your hardest song  Dad myself I feel this. You spoke some real shit G respect
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭I will  go kill that bitch nle choppa I could see you. you  are my fav rapper and I'm only a kid😢😢
I love all your videos and can you make money with my name? Is it Katie and Bell when it when it’s my sisters, your minute really remember me remind me and my name is KATIE And I love your videos, so so so so so much all my heart like I love every single once you do, but can you do one with like the Nager’s nose
"You nothing less than a goddess you best not lower your standards, a Ni**a call you sum else bet I correct his grammar" That just hit hard bro ngl shi fye
I cry everytime to this tune
He coming different on this it nice nle we love you work keep putting it in
I dont know you but I just wanted to thank you as a soon to be father to a daughter to get that true heart feeling to know what it means to do what you cant to be every part of your kids life. Better make damn sure you do ever thing you can to make sure you a are there for them no excuses
So sorry for that happened to you hopefully you can make it up so you can get to see her soon ❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bro I feel so bad for him
YOOO THIS SHI MADE ME CRYYY IDK WHYYY
Lol fast speaking not singing 😂😂😂
Ngl Choppa looked up to this song but with these recent events you not even going to your unborn child’s doctor appointment…if you not even real about bein with her when this was made a YEAR ago make this whole song feel like a lie
how about mothers who get taken from their kids because the father is jelous
"Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breath"😭😭
If the beginning is true that you can't see your daughter, I feel very bad. And that kind of sounds unfair.
This song made me tear up! This goes out to all the fathers who can't see their kids! We just gotta keep trying gentlemen!!
I wish nle was my dad
This just hit different it got me saying it word for me
i hope one they u get to see her she is so pretty
It’s bs that he has to be separated from his child like that he should be able to see his child when ever he wants to
I was about to cry during this song cuz I want him to see his daughter😢
went from co parent to no parent
Eeeee😊
I so sorry for what happened I hope you see her soon 😢😢😢😢🎉
Don't like chopper but happy for you.  An free melly. Drew did it first
i love you choppa
choppa is one of the realist niggas i swear
jesus loves you ✝✝
BLESS CHOPPA  AMEN..
i respect nle for this because not alot of ppl would do this like share there emotions and keep your head up its gonna get better
I’m also sorry to hear about your grand momma Much Luv Loc
You a great person an a dad chop on god! My baby mom left me when my girls was 4 and 1 you go form seeing them everyday to seeing them 2 days a week or hardly at all I’ve been there little homie it’s hard and child support is bull shit if you having something to do with your kids and want to be in their life’s and the moms left you it’s fucked I can tell how much you love your daughter because how you talk about her and how good you are with people and kids in your videos your moms and pops raised a great man  Much Luv!!
turn he in to a baby goat just like her daddy
May God bless us all💓
That baby a savage just like her dad lmao 💀💀 3:00
Bro this hits too hard I have two sons I'm 17 and I barely get to see them 90% of man in my position would have ran I want to stay in a being pushed away
Anyone know did Don Trip get any credit for this??  i hope so i used to listen to his song 24/7.. they both fire but i hope he got a lil something for it! Edit: i looked it up after i wrote this and saw he gave Don Trip his flowers on twitter for this song.. 💪💪💪
I love the callback to Don Tripp's song. When my ex & I broke up & I couldn't deal with not seeing her kid we'd been raising for 5 years, that song got me thru.
Stuff hit harder then my dad
Hey NLE this song is fire your daughter is very beautiful Love you so much NLE. Rp to your grandmother.
Nle choppa please )Ike my comment omg I will be so happy and I'm such a huge fan I love this song and I watched all ur videos pleaseeee
My mom got devorced in 2018 when I was 4
I just went with my dad a month ago
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😊😊😊
Nle I hope u see this comment, ur the greatest dad ever u send notes to ur daughter my dad been through that ik bc till this day he still takes care of his kids at the end of the day ur the best father
So inspirational
Genuine chills. I’ll never understand this shit when the moms use the child as weapons ladies y’all don’t realize how lucky you are to have the father want to be present like this as a child who grew up in a separated home I always wanted my daddy and to hear Choppa speak like this just damn making me wish on the type of dad I never had it don’t matter if you and the father have bad blood or if he hurt you by cheating or all that other foul shit you HAVE to put that shit aside if he is a good father to y’all’s child that’s literally all that matters don’t keep these babies away from there fathers cuz man if I could of had my dad in my life shit who knows where I would be in my life it really do make a difference and this man very clearly loves this baby and it’s really sickening to know she’s kept away from so much love that baby needs her daddy
Realist song ever released. I dont even like dude fr. shit just hits home.
Naah he's 19-21 not 18 but still
This song a heart out I listen to it every single day
I cried for him

my dad is trying to stop me from seeing my mom but we try ever thing and now we are going to see wut we can do to get to live with my mom and sisters and step dad
@cjsocool
Why it’s always the fathers that wanna be there can’t bkuz the bm be petty asf. There’s so many of us single mothers out here that be wanting our bd to even just acknowledge they kids while playing ‘daddy’ to some other female kids. Smh. But I’m glad Choppa has a beautiful bond wit his daughter now. You’re a great father Choppa !
Like your music and my name is bryso to🎉
I cried listening to this song ❤❤
Best dad ❤️
When he said I gotta separate my pride from feelings I felt that
i feel it i hope she hers this she loves u so  much
This song is so heart warming we all hope u can see your doter more
This makes me so upset- I actually cried from listening to this. He deserves better- God please protect him at all costs❤
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMh8MfHNbtM
I feel bad for him
Its crazy how i switch my friend from nle to yb 😂😂😂😂
💙
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💯💯💯💯💓💓💓💓💓💓
Even if you're not a dad, this shit makes you feel some type of way. All love Choppa ❤️
Shit hits different when you relate to the whole song word for word, shit be a slap in the face providing/ supporting, building relationships just to have your world taken away and held against you. But I’m a man and that’s just life. Forced to suck that shit up and keep going.
that drawing remindes me of my mom that died because we use to draw together
He’s only 18 and he’s better then a lot of dads 🤦🏼💀
NLE u got my respect. Still bangs 2023
Nle I finally read that last quote you said in th video and dead ass bawled like a baby good to see support for the ones left in the dark with nothing but love in our heart
I'm SO fucking TirEd
I love what your doing idk how you went to jail but I think ik but I love what you're doing and just be yourself and do not let anyone tell you what to do.
Still his hardest song till this dayyyy!!!!!
Thats how I put my daughters name up on the wall with them roses next to her name. And shit hurts nothing like i imagine
Chop, if you somehow see this, I know it's late, but she will grow up and she will learn WHO was there, who WANTED to be there.. and who wasn't letting you see her.. She will learn all of that as she gets older, stay strong and just keep loving her and showing your love she will absolutely learn the truth.. you're a great father.  My dad went through same pretty brutal shit.. my mom lied about him, got a restraining order so he couldn't see me or my sister, he would drive by the house and we'd see him, his face red crying like a mother fucker trying to see us.. it was absolutely fucking horrible, my mom told us so many lies to break us apart from him, but as we got older, we learned how huge of a MONSTER my mom was, she's nothing short of a fucking monster..  We grew up and we saw the whole pictured, colored in and everything. I love my dad more than I think ever before because we grew a certain type of bond you cannot break..  I learned all the horrible shit my mom did, I looked at transcriptions my dad printed out of my moms boyfriend at the time messaging my dad ON MY FACEBOOK ACCOUNT threatening him and shit..   I felt so fucking horrible and broken reading it, but I was reassured knowing all that is gone. You're a great father. Keep pushing, the day will come where you and your daughter will have the same diamond strong bond I have with my father <3
Shout out to all the solid fathers out their man. These hateful woman keeping us from our seeds, just to hurt us. Shit not right.
My boy
I'm sorry nle chop I get my daughter died at the age 4 I was mad and my ex wife took my son and daughter  I could not eat sleep
3:01  this was funny
i was crying by the end please dont give up nle you keep me up 🥺
Picturing my baby boy as this plays.. man this shit hits home as muthafucka
Choppa hearting   all verified ppl like u suck
Oms he was talkin in dis hoe

"gotta seperate my pride from my feelings" that was the most underrated line
You gotta see the baby's momma reaction video.  She felt that and she's  guilty and salty af
This is how I fell about me daughter
This felt like some mockingbird bs
I hope you get to see your daughter now. Kids neither father in their life. I felt you when you said co-parenting turned into no parenting.

Choppa went from a gimmicky meme rapper to one of the GOATS over the course of 4-5 years on hood
the only problem with society we're seeing is the transition of power from men to women. and it shows. wake up you sheep #MGTOW #Redpill #womenServeMen
I ain't never felt so much pain for somebody else! I'm hurting for you so much and I hope you and Mariah can have a healthy co-parenting. Judging from her tweets she hates you but that can all change if you two sat down and had a healthy conversation! ❤️
Trying to be a co parent ternt me to a no parent!!! Wow!! Fire 🔥
Got that line from the OG Don Trip from Memphis. “No pity for a G”.

I can’t believe my BM gone try to get me locked up cheated on me I left and moved a nigga in with my daughter same fucking week I’m sick asf rn and since then I haven’t been able to see my kid 😔
Man these bitches these days 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
true young father, we need more father love like this.
It's sad how some father has to go this when all they trying to do is be there for their child ....
I love your songs Anna Lee Chapa
I’m also goin through this I get to see Riley more than the did it’s still hard tho seeing the baby momma and realise where you went wrong.. I was a narcissist I admit in but I didn’t know until it was too late I’m working on it tho I want my family back ❤
I know you wouldn't shoot up a house that your kid is in especially how I see mama choppa is a good mother
😢sad but true I’m in the same situation it’s embarrassing
🥶🥰
Let  him see his daughter
nle different
this is very emotional
My name is Mariah so I felt those,my daughter was taken from me at 2.5 by dcf due to my living situation and young age I had her at 16
🇧🇸Bro...this song is Tuffa Than Tuff! Life Music...much appreciated 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟...keep it coming! All guidance and protection...Asé
My dad is going though the same thing
Yo I’m not a adult but I felt this hit bro I start to cry this the best bro no guns no flexing he just talking real sh
😢🤧🤧🤧🤧😣😣me!!!!!!!!!
It's my daughter 1st birthday and my baby mom making me miss it😔

My lil girl love this shit 🥲
Bro that line “feeling like a transparent” really hit me
He is so talented
He any better than my dad nle Chapel is the 2 one my dad is the first one ❤
the amount of power women can use when you just want to love your kid is literally mad. My dad coulda went through the same stuff because of something silly shi. I havnt seen my mom in years and as much i love and want to see her, I know what she did and it sucks knowing that a female can do this to you. No matter how good of a father you are.
Is he also not allowed to see his daughter in certain times
I 2
This made me blink back tears i am a single mother with a 3 yr old son who's father is not in his life he calls me and even strangers daddy because he is confused and it breaks my heart he was there then not and i Can only imagine what it has or will do to Honor our son if you see this and are a prayer warrior please pray for us ❤ God Bless all parents keep your head up!!

Molim za tebe da budeš u dobrim odnosima s svojom kćeri ti si super otac i ima puno ljudi koji bi se okrenuli i nebi više pokušavali,ali ti imaš srca i volje i samo tako nastavi,usput imaš jako slatku kćer.NLE je najbolji.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Letter to my children. I didn't leave daddy just had to go away. One day we will be together. Every month daddy sent money for food and all your needs your mother changed her number and blocked me. She is the one who filed reports and made problems. One day you will see all the moneytransfer receipts and letters signed and dated mailed by me all returned to my address. She sold the house kept my savings and cars. And denied me seeing you as babies. The gold the diamonds and rubies. I left with nothing only the shirt on my back and a broken heart knowing I would miss your first words your first steps. Your first day at school. One day you will turn 18 and your sister also. I will search for you two. Every night I pray to God he protect you two. Your mother can sat whatever she wants but she left me with nothing. Left to die. Daddy never folded played the cards dealt today I can say I am alive. One day I will hope to find you and your sister. If you read this stay strong
On gawd
Keep ya vision true and clear my g’s it’s the effort you put in that makes the difference no matter what’s told to our babies, kings need to show their strength…. When it gets harder that’s the time you push harder than before much love stay safe stay blessed. Our babies will know daddy has always been ready to be there even if we weren’t able to be then..
Number one song right here 💯
This is the only rappr I have respect for 💯
Dis for all da dads dat barely get to see day kid zoom in and know that everything will be ok god got better plans for us and we will be on top and be everything for our loved ones regardless god knows how everything is going so jus keep grinding and stay on the path on positivity everything will fall in place! S/o NLE for dis one 💯

Words cannot even express the love and Duty a father feels for his daughter. They really are all the best parts of us. I tell mine, "Aim for the fucking stars, baby girl. This Earth does NOT deserve you." And she knows I mean every gd word of it.
Father's matter too x🤍🖤👌✨💪☝️👀💯💯💯💯
This song helps me so much bro I appreciate you making this
That's sad

Hi
my thing is i watched her response to the song and what nle said back to her. i dont give a fuck whatever she claims he did, he based this on a true story and she threw the letters he wrote TO HIS DAUGHTER away, as a mother it wouldn’t matter to me whatever he did do how you could not keep a letter he wrote to his child is pathetic .

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥✅
Man I'm going through the same thing right now, got two kids by a girl I used to love so much. She bi polar though, so it's hard being close to her cause she liable to spaz out. She's come at me with tasers, knives, fists,  broom sticks, jump ropes. you name it. And you know how it go, if you react everybody looking at you sideways. It hurt seeing my son covering his ears up when we'd go back and forth, and I got tired of leaving the house and sleeping in my car just to get some peace at home. On god I was faithful to her, when she got pregnant with our first son, I told her she could quit her job because I made enough to support our family, I tried my hardest to make things work, but I couldn't take it anymore.  I moved out on my own got my own place and she begged to come stay with me, apologized and said she was done with all that bullshit, but it never stopped, I broke it off with her, and she started wiling out choking a nigga pulling my hair beating me on the head and shit, she tried to grab my nuts, so I was holding her off and the force I put on her body while I was pushing her off me (she was pressed against a wall) broke the wall behind her and bruised her back up. Our kids were there, while that happened. She left and called the police, telling them that I had threatened to kill her and that I was putting my hands on her. They came and arrested me and now I'm standing trial for domestic battery and intimidation in the presence of a minor. Meanwhile she texting my phone trying to apologize, calling me every day, asking me if I still love her, while the state got a no-contact order against me. I had to ignore her. I actually ended up meeting somebody else a month after bonding out, and when she found out I had moved on, she stopped letting me or my family see the kids and started writing the prosecution and DCS telling them that I was a terrible father and all kinds of crazy stuff. This my first ever criminal charge, but because of the shit she saying to them, they're tryna give me 3 years in prison, all over something I never even did. I got disqualified from my job and nobody is tryna hire me right now, because of the felony arrest on my record.  She was attacking me completely unprovoked, I was trying to break things off with her, I've been in both of my kid's lives since they was first born, I bought them all their clothes and food and like I said, been the sole breadwinner for my family for years. But because of this case, I haven't seen them for 8 months now. It's killing me because my daughter was a newborn when all this shit went down. My grand ma died last year and she never got to meet my daughter because of this shit. I'm fighting for my freedom and baby mama not trying to let me live my life if it ain't with her, and the kids are the one's who suffer the most from all of this. This song, got me in my feelings because I feel every damn word. This song make me feel like it's people out here that understand what it's like, cause it's fucked up. I'm praying that everything's gonna work out, and I can be free to live my life and see my kids again, because I miss them so much!

I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever record, yeah (you're so lazy) Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Ayy In the back of the Rolls-Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls-Royce carseat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish? Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep, wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you
Love that and she is cute ☺️

W song
Chopper I love your music so much I love you
His grandparents have past on and he was in court for nothing because his girlfriend is not letting him see his daughter and his girlfriend is burning his letters and gets him into jail like ynw melly for no reason though
This he gave his heart and soul in to this song this is true and he is wanted in the camolat song he is wanted for beating a gang up and had illegal gun in his arsenal
all of it
respect
I felt this to the bone all they doin is hurting the kids 💯
Learning how to separate yu pride from yu feelings is a sign of maturing, U are worthy of being a father😔🤟🏽💙💚
❤️
He like mine dad
YOU NEED TO DO A PART 2 PLZ
Shit had me in tears, my daughter dedicated to me she is 15. Not biologically mine but shit she is mine, my ex told me she wasn't mine when she was 7, she told my daughter I wasn't her dad a year ago without me being there or even being involved at all, fucked up.. we have a unbreakable bond me and my daughter and my ex hates it, always trying to make life difficult for me. I have always been there for my kids' life I have three girls one boy and a step daughter, I've never missed out on their life ever. 13 year old , 12 year old and my 15 year old. This song to me is one of the best ever made. Shit related to me like a mofo.
This is hard hope you see your daughter again
I love the baby

My baby moms tripping don’t let me see my son ever this shit hit bro hopefully we figure this out right 💯
All he wanted to do is see his daughter it breaks my heart to see this😢😢
I feel bad for this man NLE
Damn this shit hit more than ever. System took my son away.
“Bet I correct his grammar “
This sound like vauleble pain by youngboy
This song make me wish she saw the grandparents
Man this one got to me... so much resonation within these words
I want you to know I dedicated this song to my daughter she really going to understand where we came from shit sucks but you came thru !
I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever record, yeah (you're so lazy) Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Ayy In the back of the Rolls-Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls-Royce carseat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish? Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep, wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you
This shit is something else listen to it everyday💯🔥 realist shit
I got the same problem. I never denied him seeing the kids n he took em from me. I guess that ain't really my family cuz really that's all I see. Don't mean I don't have that love just mean I ain't allowed to see them.

Blessings and Love to you King from one father to another. My daughter is much older now, but I too have a similar story that relates so well to your own test of faith in your fatherhood as you try to work with the moms and all that. Just continue to keep pushing brotha in getting better, finding your peace, and your greater purpose for you and your daughter... Teach  and guide her in the most positive way about how God is and has been getting you through to your successes, and also about your challenges. Keep growing with her in all that you do. Bless up King! Blessings to you as a growing man of God and as a  growing father!

You are my fav keep it up bro good luck
Not better dan NBA YoungBoy 😘💖
He might be the best dad out there and he not gon to see his child that he made  imagine going so school and saying nle chooper my dad thats a blessing
Is your doughter a crip bc you r one (AS A QUESTION)
Everybody Saying That His Baby Died In This So RIP 🕊
Every time I hear this song I drop tears
I can feel your pain I am blue heart 💔
You are the best dad but why she don’t let you see your daughter she so so pretty your baby mama is a bitch  and I know how you feel my family miss my brother you are the best
It’s unbelievable how people put in so much work and make story’s that mean so much and they also make a good song NLE is only 19 and he is very successful in life. more successful than most dads in this world that aren’t doing anything with their life when they could be doing so much like nle is right now. A lot of people don’t try to be amazing at something but nle knew the day he started rapping that he was gonna try his hardest and not be a person who does only enough to get through life. Nle is one of the best at making songs that mean something💜
I got big respect for NLE CHOPPA but its messed up how she doing u like that bruh
12 25 13** dad loves you mini me ❤
2022 anyone?💗
So cute and sad
Sad

Rip
man yall know that blueface is a crip but fuck the crips me imma personally a blood and man blue face its on sight bru on sight
when he was like “You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping” it’s gon be hell for whoever she date if they don’t treat her right 😭
I'm crying now this so cute
was drake the cop
The line that went “please, no pity for a g” jus like Don Trip had in his song letter to my son respectfully Choppa did it right ✊🏽
Very emotional song put me in my feelings
I wanna daughter but my gf parents are still thinking about it and it has been a year they said maby but they said she has to move in wit me
Man I shed a tear on this. As someone who currently doenst live with their parents, this hurts. My mom is white and my dad is black. I see my mom about once a week, sometimes more. I haven’t seen my dad in 7-8 years. My dying wish is to see him again. I remember all the times we would eat hot Cheetos on the couch when I was little. I miss him so much. Let this man see his daughter. Even when you are so young and people don’t think you remember these things or it affects you, it does. Even my younger brother is affected by it and he was real little when shit went down. I’m telling you bc right now I’m just living life as a depressed mixed kid with no mom and dad who lives with they great grandparents. Love you NLE this was my story. Respect ✊🏼❤️
January 2,2022 I love this song. You are good daddy
Aww he a good guy fr ❤️
nle keep your  head high my guy crazy how u changed
he is still a good father
Plz No pity for a g, I know I got a daughter I barely  get to see, It hasn’t been a couple hours it’s been since the first week, And I’ve been losing sleep and it’s hard for me to eat 😢
Homie THIS MY LIFE…💯❤️‍🔥✅🙏

My dad would be going through the same thing you are going through
L mom

Yeah like shaq said keep fighting for the child
It is true about cut up offing his feet to see here first steps I’m the same
God loves you and I do too and he sent his son  Jesus to die on the cross for our sin.Give your life to Jesus before it’s to late. Jesus he is the way,the truth and the light.If you want to know how reply with how!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Cold parent to no parents" damn thats sucks

Aight NLE and everybody seeing this wear rubbers so everything he saying won't happen to you because if got money and get a girl pregnant ten to one she traped yo ass
I'm a big fan
I love this song nle keep up the great work 👍🎵🎵♥️
I have kids they got sold STUPID HUMANS I listen to this all day
I feel sorry for him dont feel bad my dad is going though the same thang i have not seen him since i was 3 and i am 13 anout to turn 14 now😭😭😭  Love you nle choppa you get my preyers
My father is 50 years old but you will never hear him taking about his kids like this then a 18 year old is better than him. 🤦🤦
Bro no cap a batter dad than bout 65percent of these dads
My show my nigga some love being a better dad then alot of them
That made me cry
In many different cultures there people who claim that people who are not married should not have kids because when they are not married they end up like this. Not being able to see their kids, one parent holding the child against the other because they are mad and bitter. While most people want a two parent household, sometimes things don't go as planned and the parents end up in court for months to years just to co-parent for an innocent child that done nothing to the world. Rapper NLE Choppa know he probably did some things wrong but he matured and became a better man when is daughter arrived. Because as he said there people in group home who don't have no one providing for them. It none of my business and since we really don't know the whole story I just pray that NLE Choppa and Mariah could come to an agreement of some sort so both part could be happy and try to coexist for their daughter Clover.
the beat is fire perfect for the song he did my heart got overwhelmed even the ayyyy at the beginning was so hard
Big fan of NLE CHOPPA
Damné a daughter
🇧🇷❤️
You are my best rapper

And yes I am a child I am 8 years old I am so much smart you wanted to date a a16 boy that's in 10th Grade and you 19 years old so you was calling me playing this all up girl you was so petty
Girl what would you not let him see your child that is so Petty girl get a life because you acting like you made that child by yourself you did not make that child by yourself so stop acting like it cuz you really being petty right now like his daughter and you don't say he put his hands on you he literally said he would never put his hands and he never ever put his hands on them and if you say he put his hands on you what the bruises so you don't got no answer so and my is akenzley.

I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever record, yeah (you're so lazy) Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Ayy In the back of the Rolls-Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls-Royce carseat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish? Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep, wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter
long live this legend you are such an inspiration to me and many others much love big bro 💯💯❤‍🩹

This song hits me hard "I've never put my hands on no woman wasn't raised that way" that line right there makes me tear up because I literally just went through that.. 😢I met this girl I thought was my soulmate and things were going amazing she even told me that she feels like she's pregnant.😢 next thing I know someone messages her claiming i was messaging other women but in reality I was keeping it loyal the whole time..😭 then my exes sister and her boyfriend drops me off with her in the back with me back home and then i stayed the rest of the night at home after that she claims I was at her place at 4AM hitting her..when In reality I was sleeping at home after I got dropped off... Now I don't know what's going to happen with my baby and that kills me....😭😭😭😭😭😭   Edit: Thank you everyone  for the likes and the support  in the comments  it means the world to me!  - a 23 year old that wants to be there for his child more than anything
🥺
Love😍😍😍😍😍💝💝💝👊👊👊

I'm a designer for my daughter
Every thug needs a hug
This song hit hard af I feel you nle I can understand how hard it is for you my father was always busy with work leaving my mom to get stressed raising us by herself and she started doing drugs and alcohol leading to an od which killed her. Love to you nle and I hope your daughter and you can unite together with no barriers in y’all’s relationship
im so sorry hopefully you will get her back peace king
This wasnt ment to be
why do u talk about guns and bad stuff?
Bro this shit spoke to me. I'm going through the same shit with 2 daughters and bms😭
Sorry for your loss G.
Who still come back to this song just to wonder what he going through
i love nle choppa so much
L bm
“gotta separate my pride from my feelings” hit different
Nle I’m prying
❤❤❤❤💯💋
I remember when he was explaining the story on Ig everyone was laughing and taking him as a joke now they're taking it serious
I was supposed to be a father but had a unexpected miscarriage this helped me ( Kehlani & Sage ) I love you both ❤️❤️
like the song still, fire pray you  get to see your pretty angel
It is good to have a dad that tries to be your life my dad was never in my life he was abusive to my mom and me but now he has a family that he actually cares about but not me and i was his first kid.
Thanks Top Shotta
We fell bad for you nle choppa
Man I no that you miss her
I’ll literally set the world on fire for your love 💯
Love all ur vids and songs u make me laugh you are sooo funny😀😀
This song hit different
I'm so sorry how to get the 💙seahorse
Damn, he said "I can't really call it pain because I know its a process."
This is a classic and it hit so hard my BM won't let  me see my daughter's either I don't know how fathers go without seeing their children I'm going crazy not seeing my babies
''They say Black fathers don't matter (I'll be back, Clover), they say Black fathers don't care (But more than anything, I'll always be there, I love you)'' yh they lie on black fathers all the time. black fathers and white fathers, both f-up most times, but the colonizers control the media so you know they'll make themselves look good and ONLY themselves.
Who woldint let you sorry NLE
Someone may break your heart, but you know no one can break you’re spirit.
Is that you ooh just do cup of tin.
Nle choppa is a changed man he’s a good man I’m sorry nle
This song hit hard, especially since I delt with some of this shit after me and my BM split apart a few years ago. Glad I got custody, was worth the fight to get my little man back into my arms. I hope and pray to all the amazing fathers out there wanting to be apart of a childs life that everything works in your favor, keep your head up and don't give up. It may be a whole process just to see them again, might cost money to battle but in the end it'll all work out if your intentions are genuine.  As for the moms out there, if a father wants to be involved don't push them away its hurting the child the most. Finding a man that wants to be involved with that child for the rest of their lives is very rare, I agree some guys are dead beats and don't deserve to be a father or just don't want to be, but at the same time nothing will change a true man like getting to hold that angel in his arms. Just as a child saved or changed your life for the better, its the same for a man it isn't a 1way street. Just cause your a mother now doesn't mean you know whats best for that child, youll learn that when they grow up giving you a cold shoulder cause their daddy wasn't allowed to be involved cause you let your pride and feelings get in the way just cause you wanna be with another guy or whatever.
Rocking that CROOKS sweater 2:18 word
Going through it this kept me going this morning turned hate to hurt and pain I appreciate that🖤
I felt every word. I know what it’s like to be kept away from your dad and all he wants is to be with you 💔
Am I the only one who teard up
Coming from a daughter like that, except my dad made no effort to come see me. He only wanted to see me to give me my child support. And thinks he’s the greatest dad in the world. This man actually loves his daughter and can’t see her, that’s SAD. hope everything getting situated she deserves to be with him
Bro this be happening all the time its honestly bs
We need more music like this more music about our struggles more music to uplift our community great song
Poor NLE I feel so bad for him
Dang bruh that’s tuff
R.I.P REST IN PARADISE GRANDMA CHOPPA keep your head up Nle Choppa.
Free my dad they took me away from him when I was five👌🏾❤️need to be with my dad before he dies he loves me so much I'm glad I get to talk to him tho👌🏾

Bro I hope he and his daughter live a really happy life because this song touches me. It’s so sad that he can’t see his own daughter 😔when he said “how I wanted to have a child just to have sum to live for” was emotional for me
Thank you Bro !!
Choppa the opposite of the dads too many of us have he wants to be their and guide his daughter prayin for you g
Beautiful song for the daughters sons and fathers
choppas wearing all black forces
He the best
Love ❤️ NLE choppy
Myles Pedersen, days/months/years done the line, when you stumble apon this, I hope the universe did us right splitting us so far apart so quickly,   imagine for a moment a Doctor making a report to Children's aide due to him failing to properly read the ultrasound so the child looked like he was way smaller + further along then he was, then having the child ripped from your arms due to this after the child came out healthy + only 2 weeks premature.  No pity for a g, but feel bad for the kid. Court in the morning, find out if your dearly departed, or coming home to this fresh starting.
How can people dislike this song
its okay man keep ur eyes up
Shit man, this hit me hard. No father should be kept from their kids....especially their grandparents. <3
I—
This shit right here my man 🙏🙏
dont worri your my guy
Nle choppa hard... you ain't nothing less than the gottis so don't ever lower your standards
Bro all he wants to do is spend time with his daughter almost every single day like I have the same situation with my mom and dad where I can’t see my dad my mom is always going crazy over reacting to stuff like this is not fair I can understand NLE
Bruh i hope u spend as much time as u possibly can with yo daughter✊👨‍👧
we all hope you get her back so you can see your Queen
I can relate
I still listen to this and 10 months happened I’m biggest Nle fan ☑️☑️☑️🚭🚭📈📈📈📈 let’s keep it up let’s go
This shit fire.
“might not hear your first words and its hurting me to death” man that shit deep. Keep yo head up king🤴
My Sun, is fighting this same fight for his Sun. My Heart goes out to my Young Men trying to break this Generational Curse🙏🏾❤

I love him i still play this shii
NLE Choppa I love you ❤️
Who else still listening to this masterpiece‼️🔥
I love when men show unashamed love for their kids. Especially their daughters! ❤️
i hope you see your baby girl  i  did not see my day in a long time i will pray for you and colver like cute like her grandma
He's barely chilling out with his best friend
My man is willing to put his gang life away
We meed lyrics !!!! Please!
I know I’m not the only one who thinks he sounds like lil durk 👀🗣
La neta nose q dice pero suena bien
This made me mf cry. "All ever a child need is support."
I love the constant use of please to show how truest desperate he is to be apart of his child’s life
"Tryna put me on child support, but all the child need is support", that verse really hit me hard.
She will reap what she sows, I would never keep m son from his mother's family out of spite it's wrong and damaging to the child, I hate to see anyone go through this!
Can’t stop crying thank you for this song 😪
the best in the world sounding in the Dominican Republic
This sht make a father get in his feelings 💯
Man fuck it Annalee chopper boy you’re so fucking good
Hol up that's joyner's beat
When I trun on the mosik the beat was so good
This song sooo slept on
Why the cop slawmed Choppa like for real like what bro Choppa you feel me like what your baby mama is crazy you didn't even touch you I saw it she called the police and nle one question did you get locked up is the real like when you got out you finish the song or this is fake
I know nle Choppa I know how u feel
Tha thin i like bout nle is he always has a message n his song keep it up 💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
everytime i play this song i cry
Fuck I’m happy I don’t have to know that pain… I can’t imagine. I have homies who want nothing more than to see their kids, who make every move with the goal of custody, who don’t even get their visitation because they’re behind on child support because rent went up a few months back and he can’t get caught up.  I see their names get dragged on social media… called deadbeats, “My Babydaddy ain’t shit”, when all they want is to be in their lives… I pray you get to see her soon Choppa. It might take until she’s your age, but one day the truth will come out and she’ll see how hard you’re trying. Don’t give up.
mad respect to nle
I loved you before & even more now. 💙BlackFathersMatter🧚🏽‍♀️
Kids need day mom and father in day life

Mannn he got on here and poured his mf heart out. Even I felt this.

I’m a woman and I’m here to tell the women out here to stop raising y’all daughters to take their kids away from the father all because he don’t want you. Humble yourselves. This song made me cry. I have a 10year old son, I promise if a female ever try to do something like this, were fighting for that child until someone gives in but honestly, I pray that he makes the right choices in women.

Gl props 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
this song will be goated for a while
I bet skydoesminecraft would feel this song
Keep fighting for your daughter 😃
Women have to stop being bitter. And be better for our children. You made a baby with that man and if he trying so hard to be in that child's life then you keeping him out is only hurting that baby. Get out your feelings and think about these kids. You hate that man...thats a you problem..you chose to have that man's baby get some therapy and make better choices! And I can say this from exp. 💪🙏🤞 . Blessings to the men who stay showing up even when the whole world kicking them down. Not all men are deadbeats.
Yes yes love this song true Prince you are one in a million "+"******************£€👑🎠🎠🎠🎠🎠🎠🎠🎠💋💌🗣🌈🌈🌈🌈🦁🦍🎥📷📷🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎈🎈🎈🎈🎃💝

If u dislike this u heartless
Nle speaking facts
I felt that hard #letnleseehisdaughter
I wish some parents could co-parent the right way and have the child spend time with mom and dad without any issues. Never take that privilege from your child ever ! Your child shouldn’t suffer because you as parents don’t get along. This song is a good example, a father who loves his daughter, who wants to be there and is fighting his way into her life while some kids don’t even have their fathers in their lives.My biological father was never there for me but that was his choice not my moms and my step father had to step in and play that role.I have two kids and my mom always told me “don’t take your kids away from you husband if you ever split no matter what”. When my step dad and mom split my brother always saw his dad everyday and even though my mom didn’t get along with him she always tried her best to make it work so my brother never lost his dad. Unfortunately my step dad passed away last year but he died knowing he gave everything to us growing up.
We need more of this
This one hits me hard haven’t seen my kids in 8 years
“I’ll cut my feet off to see your first steps” 🔥 🔥
This was from the heart.
aww your daughter is so cute ik you wil be a fantastic or better than that father😄
I ain’t even got kids and I’m crying
I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever record, yeah (you're so lazy) Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Ayy In the back of the Rolls-Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls-Royce carseat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish? Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep, wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you, NLE

Hope u see ur daughter g
Da baby momma still inlove with u nigga but it's clear that u broke her heart now she's taking away the most important thing that u love
hits hard bro...
This right here hurt! I was that daughter.  Now 45. Have a ex husband that gets his kids everyday. No way I'd put the kids I love so dearly through what I went through.  I was in love with my daddy.  Still cry for him. You get to see your baby yet? She's going to appreciate this song.  Me and my brother found a chest full of letters my dad wrote.  We felt betrayed and hurt even to this day. If you bm's reading this, the kids pay worst than the fathers.  Our lives wouldve been more privileged with our dad like this baby's could be.  Stop being selfish.
I’m only 16
😭😭😭😭Nle always 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Choppa changed a lot over the years n some people still find a way to try to bring him down as a rapper or as a person

Yo chop bro I def felt this on a personal level still don’t get to see neither one of my kids
Havent seen my kid in about a month & it's hard because everytime I think about my daughter it makes me think & it makes me related to this song. I can feel his pain because even though I'm not a bad father I know damn well I am a good father. It just kills me because the babymothers got more power than us babydaddies. I miss being with my daughter I miss her smile I still dream about her till this day & shes only 6 months about to go on her 7months. I love you mija dont ever forget even if im gone I'm always gonna be here my little princess Zallany Amirah Garcia

Sorry for that I hope you feel better because I had to go through the same thing so we know that it hurts
Not really hatin on the baby mama and stuff but i blame her at least let him see his daughter.
If drew didn’t film it
Women treat the good Fathers like there nothing and don't let them see there kids but if it was a deadbeat that was beating on them they stay around.
I cried at the end so hard cuz it reminds me of my dad how he’s separated from my mom it happened at the night of Christmas it’s almost been 2 years since I’ve seen him.
Choppy I know it’s hard for u but here’s some advice/ what ever put u down DONT let it get to u
Bro I want you on my first album
Nle Choppa is tryna see his daghter but she is tryna put child support on him.   that is just sad.
And dudes hating on him in his own hood because he a cool dude.
Imagine being able to grow up and just be like yeah  NLE Choppa  is my dad
PLEASE Stop  producing this crap! This guy couldn’t sing if you gave him a million bucks! This is an affront to the arts everywhere!
Fire

Choppa is the better parent because he is fighting for his daughter instead of just leaving when he isnt allowed to see her. Keep fighting bruh 💪🏼
I have battled with the same scenario for the past 18 years..But in time,she will come looking for her Daddy..Just gotta be strong enough to weather the storm.. Although..the thought of the Christmas I missed,birthdays,I wasnt able to teach her how to ride a bike,or pick her up and kiss her knees after she fell. It still is something I battle with..But shes my BEST FRIEND now..So I am grateful for that!!
I feel.bad for nle chopped

https://youtu.be/_8veYfZBh_c
I felt this man. My bm held my daughter away from me for over 2 months after a petty argument. She had just turned 1. That shit changed me, I fell into depression that whole time. I finally got to see her at one point and she didn’t even recognize me, wouldn’t even let me hold her. That shit was heartbreaking. I went to the store and bought a teddy bear for her, I bought a small t shirt that could fit the bear, and got the T-shirt customized with a picture of me and my daughter so she could have something that wouldn’t let her forget my face. I’m pretty sure my bm threw it away tho. Idk why girls do shit like that, that shits so damn cruel. My prayers go out to all the fathers that are going thru the same situation 🙏🏾 Just know things get better.
Always thinking about familyy damn choppa
This is for all the other fathers out there that cant see there child 💔🙏🏽
I love you man your the best I hope the best for you

This song so fukkin hard .. i be high asf bumping yo musix
Before you ignore this, remember that everyone started from somewhere. Hello I'm Khari, I'm a lover of all Bossa Nova, Hiphop, Rock, and the beautiful jazz. I made a track called with an amazing up, and coming singer named Sheena  "Think of you" . For years I wanted to be a musician but fear always made me say "My time is too late, I missed my shot" so at 26 I became fed up with the day to day, moved to rural japan  and started putting out music. This song is a bit similar to Michael Buble's "I just haven't met you yet". Touching on topics like safeguarding your heart, and imaginary love.  I would be so grateful if you all could listen to me. Oh, I also created a new genre Hip-hop + City Pop #CityHiphop. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAJ0XbYz88Q
You know you have haters on your song to
I got black air forces to and I like every song that you make

I still see photos of her but i just wanna be in her life too man. I wanna be her support like you want too homie.  Thank you for making this song! Wish my daughter could hear it too!
''I Never put my hands on a women,wasnt raised that way''...:(
Love you Bryson . Keep your head up !!❤️❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯🤝🏿
So many dudes relate to this song including myself,  bc this battle is spiritual warfare and a blatant attack on us Men. Especially niggas bc we be out here catching felonies in a bogus system, trying to be with our kids and make our families work. Then get called a dead beat when ya get outta jail. With that being said,  keep ur faith and realize this is bigger than us individually. Gods Plan. Oh yea PS: don't let a woman disrespect you or play you or cause you to sacrifice what u believe in bc she is damn near black mailing u saying you're gotta do what she say to see ur kids…nvr do that!  Keep ya heart 3 stacks, keep ya heart....these girls is smart (not rly tho)... play yo part - Andre 3000
he ant done shit wrong and what dissin niggas? fix your ears or get a doctor gotta pray for this man smh and ik this kinda late but well yeah
my fav line is " Mold you to a baby G just like yo daddy "
Which is better:letter to mama or letter to my daughter
Damn this really hit home
Idk if you will ever see this but this song saved my life. Called 911 for an ambulance and cops showed up threw me on the ground I got everything on camera and because I wouldn’t say I fell on accident when the cop grabbed and threw me he said my house smelled like meth and then called CPS and took my 2 year old baby my soul left my body. My baby is home I passed all the drug tests and did everything they asked went above and beyond but that killed 1 month 1 week she went to foster care and I fought like hell this song got me and my co parent partner through the struggle. Thank you man. The pain is unbearable I wish there was laws to protect father from selfish evil mothers and the law that power trips. Much love bro so proud of you. This is my favorite song in the world.
My baby dad is doing this shit to me with my daughter. I miss her so much. I just wanna be able to call her and see her whenever I want again.
Yoooo this man really inpsire me he was like me who tryna get his music out there to now the goat.......Respects
"I'll cut my feet off just to see ur first steps" THAT GO WAY TO HARD AND THEN, "U better not lower your standards" Nle hopefully you get to see ur daughter I love this. Then we got the "Im trying be a co parent but I'm a no parent" WAY TO HARDDDD... I love this i support this stand strong to the end ♡ ill be voting for you. SUPPORT THIS.
This for all the mothers too who can’t see or be with they toddlers! I pray we get to see them again
“Never put my hands on a woman wasn’t raise that way”that Shii hits keep your head up nle your daughter when she grows up she gon see what you did for her and keep fight don’t let your guard down love you man❤️🙌🏿

My father went through this for most of my life, shit hit real close to home 😭
My gf just broke up with me because “she’s not ready for a relationship”. I didn’t nothing but be nice and supportive and fun with her and I thought she was happy with me. I even asked her if she was happy many many times because that’s the most important thing to me. She told me she was. She broke up with me because she wasn’t ready, not because of something I did. I couldn’t control that and I couldn’t have changed the outcome, that’s why it hurts so much. She just told me that that wasn’t the only reason she broke up with me. She started to lose feelings for me and started to like her ex. Her ex is a guy who talks about how he wants to kill himself all the time, he is racist, he’s cheated on countless girls. He’s just not a good person. She’s perfect and she deserves so much better. But I can’t do anything to stop her getting hurt by him. I just have to sit and watch it all happen and it hurts so much. I lost my best friend and my girlfriend over the course of 2 days because she likes a guy like that. He’s good enough but I’m not.  Here’s my story:  My name is Nic and I’m 15 in like 3 days. That might sound a little young to be heartbroken but I promise I’m more emotionally mature than most people my age. I know what it’s like to love but I don’t know what it’s like to feel loved anymore.  I first saw her on the bus. She’d just moved to my school because of family issues and she lived in a neighborhood near mine. I saw her on the bus and I thought she was the most beautiful girl in the world. She looked perfect, but not in the way most people would think. She didn’t look like a model. She looked human. And I loved that.  Earlier in the week I saw she’d followed me on Instagram so I figured I’d text her on there. I even remember the time. It was 1am and I was about to go to sleep and I had a sudden burst of confidence and I just said fuck it and texted her. I said, “Hey you’re really pretty. I just thought I’d let you know in case you thought otherwise.” I wasn’t expecting much. I thought she’d say thanks and move on like nothing happened. But she didn’t move on and neither did I. We started texting every waking moment of every single day we weren’t at school.   We were both really shy so at school we’d just ignore each other in the hallways. I would purposely walk in the halls during passing period just so I could maybe see her even though I knew I wouldn’t go up to her. It was stupid now that I look back on it.   We texted for a solid 3 weeks before we ever talked in person. We talked about our lives and how we wanted to change. We talked about what we want in a partner. We talked about everything there is to talk about. We even joked around all the time. I eventually found out she added me on Instagram because she saw me on the bus and thought I was cute. That made me feel good.  Eventually I got up the courage to talk to her in person. We had always talked about how we both like hugs so I thought I’d hug her even if it was a little weird. I just kinda stood next to her for a couple seconds leaning on the wall. My entire body was shaking. Eventually I said “just hug me” and went in for a hug. It was the best hug I’ve ever had and I miss the feeling.   We started FaceTiming. I was really camera shy so it took a minute to get used to it but eventually I did. We would talk about everything we used to text about, but this time I’d call her pretty every 5 minutes because somehow she didn’t see it. She thought her boobs were too big and she had a big forehead and she didn’t like those smile lines on her face. I didn’t care about her boobs, her forehead wasn’t noticeably big, and those smile lines looked so freaking cute for no reason.   One day she brought up me coming over to her dad. I was nervous but I knew I really wanted to. Her dad thought we should go bowling and I thought that was a good idea because I’d never met her family and I thought it would be fun. We went bowling and I didn’t do that bad. I think I was second to last place. After we went bowling we went back to her house and we just chilled for an hour or so. We just kinda layed  on her floor watching a movie. She grabbed my hand to hold it. It felt weird at first because I’d never really done it before but I loved it. The hour and a half went by so fast and I wish it hadn’t. I wished I didn’t have to go but I said goodbye. We hugged again and I left.   That might not sound like a big deal to you guys but for someone like me who doesn’t get the emotional support they need from home, it feels good to know somebody cares.   I started coming over to her house once a week. We’d just watch a couple movies and then I’d leave. Instead of sitting on her floor we got in her bed. She has a loft bed so it’s way up high in the air. Her dad made us leave the door open of course and we’d just lay down and watch a movie. It was really simple but just being next to her made me feel so happy I could explode. But not explode in a bad way. Explode like I’m filled with so much happiness there isn’t room for any more.   I went over to her house on a Thursday. It was April 14th. We did the same thing we always do but this time I felt something else. I felt the urge to kiss her. I was laying there in her bed and I looked at her but I couldn’t do it. It went on like that the entire time. When I had to leave we hugged goodbye and I kissed her on the cheek because I figured that would be easier. I kissed her on the cheek and it wasn’t as hard as I thought it would be. Then out of nowhere I found myself going in for a real kiss. It wasn’t the best kiss in the world but I think it counted as a kiss. I was really happy.  4 days later, it’s a Sunday and we hadn’t talked all weekend because she had a friend over. I ask her if she wants to FaceTime because we hadn’t in a while and she says yes. I call her and she picks up. She’s in tears. She tells me she’s sorry over and over again and I could just feel something is wrong. I could feel something bad was about to happen. She tells me she can’t talk and asked if we could text instead. I hesitantly say yes. She tells me she thinks we should break up. She told me she wasn’t ready for a relationship and she doesn’t want a boyfriend right now. My mind starts racing. “Did I do something wrong? Was it the kiss” I shouldn’t have kissed her”. I started blaming myself before she could even finish. She told me it wasn’t anything I did. We talked about it for a while and then we say goodbye.   I was devastated. It felt like our relationship was just getting started. It felt like something beautiful was happening, as stupid as that sounds. It felt incredible to have somebody care about you. When she broke up with me it felt like all that happiness, all that joy, all that comfort, got snatched out of my hands. It sucked for a long time.  3 weeks later I’m still confused about why she broke up with me. She told me she was happy but how can she be happy if she isn’t ready? If she’s happy why would she break up with me? I started asking her because I felt like I had no other choice. I think she felt bad for lying so she told me the truth. She said she started to lose feelings for me and start to like her ex. It felt like she kicked me while I was down. She didn’t break up with me for herself, she broke up with me because she likes some other guy who doesn’t respect girls, who is mean and terrible, and who’s not good for anybody. I started blaming myself again. He’s good enough but I’m not. He deserves her but I don’t.  It’s been about 2 months since that all happened and I still think about her at least once a day. I don’t cry anymore and I don’t get sad anymore but I wish I didn’t think about her. I think I’m almost over her and I thank you guys for that. Your guys’ comments have made me realize that it’s her loss and I can’t make her love me. Thank you guys so much. I love you all. 💋
what do you guys think would happen to a person that heart his daughter? jw

NLE the 🐐
aid this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever record, yeah (you're so lazy) Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Ayy In the back of the Rolls-Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls-Royce carseat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish? Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep, wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you
Hope she okay  And sort now choppa

The mother should let him see his baby ... It hurts my heart for the child and father because the mother is only hurting her baby the most.. as a mother I could never be so petty and keep a good father away no matter my feelings or drama between the parents don't involve the baby if they good parents.. I hope things change for you! You are a good father.❤️

I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep, wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you
this isn’t fair to nle at all that’s  his child too he should be able to see his daughter she really keeping him from the baby because of something petty that’s not fair to the daughter to keep her away from her father and it’s not fair to NLE because he wants to be in his child’s life and he can’t their are a lot of fathers who don’t want they kids or wanna see them or do things to prevent from seeing they kids like my father did y’all be taking advantages of the fathers who are doing great when really y’all should appreciate them wanting to be there because for me my momma had to play both roles but imma keep praying you get to see your daughter a lot more nle this isn’t fair for you but I hope it’s fair soon:(
his ex I think .. be tripping just let the man see his own child
1:08 I feel u
This is sad
NLE choppa is on top
Man this song is so sad of how it showed NLE wanting to see his daughter but his wife won't let em. 😔
ɢɪᴠᴇ ʜɪᴍ ʜɪs ᴅᴀᴜɢʜᴛᴇʀ ᴘʟᴢᴢᴢ 😭😭💯
My son sent me this song & I broke down crying 😥 because me & him have been going through this same shit. Except my Bm waited 12 years to take out child support on me 🤷🏼‍♂️? Before that letter came in my mail we got along great but after that we don’t communicate anymore which is very sad. I tried with no luck. My son just turned 14 last week. But something happened that I never thought could or would. I got a call early Fathers Day morning & my son was so excited to tell me that his mama had taken me off child support & that was my Fathers Day present from her!!!! At first I thought I was either dreaming or hallucinating 😂 But when I called Dcs they confirmed it to be true! I’m about to get my drivers license back soon & everything 🙌  To all the good hearted Fathers going through this same bullshit trust me NLE is right that God be looking out for us. 🙏
My dad had the same problem me and my brother never saw hes daddy in 12 years💕💕
The brown octave fifthly chop because haircut lamentably sin pro a courageous monday. abnormal, subdued twig
Hate him he has a message in this song overcome challenges he’s a good artist
Just trust god he will guide you
I fell u

Felt this shit going through the same with my son it’s eating me inside but I know it’s a process 💔
That baby mama needs to stop being bitter and be a woman and let you see your daughter! That is so messed up!
Get that Lil Salami feature NLE
Yo nle you're a great father treating you daughter even though you cant see mad respect for  you
Keep fighting for your dohter  Never stop be strong my brodda
People don’t take him seriously enough man
So does he Credit Don Trips "Letter to my son" anywhere... Because it's obvious.. VERY obvious thats where the inspiration for this song came from.
He will kill for his daughter and with all respect he's a changed man
When his daughter is older and sees this she’ll know that her dad tried everything and she’ll love it
Sorry nle you so tho this just keep pushing tho it tho
Yo he can sing
Nle i love u i know u know that u hit this hard
i hope she grows up to know her dad loves her

A reminder that this man is only 18
I never got to hear my sons first words or see his first steps still not seen him and my daughter it's been 3 years I'm trying to take her to court but she's still trying to refuse contact there 😭😭😭
"Hope You get the chance to meet my grandpa and my grandma"
I’m 17 and this song is letting me to know the real colour of life and how it feels to be kept away from my child
Awww I just know he put his everything in this❤️
I get the struggle he is going for bc I’m going through the same thing
Omg I freaking  crying 🤧😭
My son will be 2 in a month can't even see him cause his baby mom doesn't believe I deserve to because her and I didn't get along... I know I'm a good dad but she just wanted the clout. Single mom boohoo me type shit. I loved my sons mom and did everything I could for her but she bi polar don't take no meds and had a shitty abusive past with her parents. Can't see my boy because she had a shitty life and wants to take it out on someone else.... I feel the pain Choppa you ain't alone.

Dawg I might not have a kid but it hurts to see ppl going thru dis...Keep ur head up
One of my brothers is a convicted felon did 10 year's in the Fed's.  Came home got his shit right and fought for his daughter until he was granted custody.   Some dude's just throw in the towel or don't care at all about seeing their child/ren.   Don't give up on your baby girl, keep going until you get custody. You got this👑
Nle you fire
That’s real hip hop. To put your pain and struggle on wax. To make your fans see your pain and feel. To speak for all the men and women who is going through this but they don’t have a voice. Haven’t felt this way about a song since pac last spoke. Keep telling our stories young King. This is 🔥🔥🔥
If t ever sees this I love u
Hope you have a top family law lawyer working on this.
Leave her if she dont want you, just leave her!

You out did yourself young!!!
This is good music
I wish i still had a dad
wow, very powerful track
man she trying to put nle  on  child support thats fucked up
damn
I know women do this to men and if you reading  this at this moment know that dads matter in children lives whether  you think it or not. Yall gotta break the cycle of keeping  dads away from kids cause you are hurt by the relationship that failed. My kids dad passed away almost 3 years ago ; and til this day they cry for him and we watch his funny videos all the time just to hear his voice. You never know what you have til its gone. Please dont be the reason for why your child has problems  in life. You didnt make them by yourself so let that man see his kid.
Tell me why the chick looked like sid from ice age
I know you dropping soon, not soon enough tho but this song is real af🔥🔥
This sum rod wave type beat
I don’t think it’s fair to keep a child away from there mother/father just because of selfish reasons. I have a child myself and when his dad and I separated I never once thought of keeping my son away from his dad. To me that’s devastating for a child to have to go through. It’s already heart breaking that the parents aren’t together anymore and for the child to not be able to be with his or her mom and dad together everyday. It breaks my heart when my son used to cry at night because he missed his dad.
My FAV song by choppa
yo this song os fire bro nle is diffrent in a good way my fav liryc is "' molde u to a baby g just like your daddy" that bar go hard

0:37
this is sad
Tears drop everytime I hear this, Me & My BM would party everyday and when my daughter was born I straightened up, I gave my daughter's mom $200-$300 every week for herself, nails hair gas whatever, paid ALL the bills, and it wasn't enough, we separated a year later, she wanted to still party talkin bout she's a new mom needs to breathe, i would stay home with my daughter she would go party come back 2, 3, 4 in the morning and I'm waiting on her so i could be at work at 5am...smh, just sad my daughter has to be without both parents at home but everything's definitely improved, not easy but life is short so I ALWAYS do WHATEVER to see my little smile...Love you Leela (my princess)...she'll be three this August 13...😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
True man that sad
I wonder why you can’t see your baby you shot at your baby momma when she was pregnant with YOUR baby dumbass wonders why idiot
You have all my love and support. I fucking love you!
This song make me cry everytime I'm going through this now I miss my princess

"I would cut my feet off to see your  first steps" bro that's deep
I never felt a song that I could relate so much to❤️💪🏾 stay strong I hate it for fathers that go through this
Choppa has soul. Something most rappers ain't got nomo
I really did not know you went through this if we was close friends I would go to jail for you dang I fell bad butt yea yo baby mama should go to jail she hurt yo fellongs
It's been a whole month in my head I still think it's the number one
My dad will never do this in his life the only thing he dose is lie to get out of work and I see some old lady that's maybe 70 years old mowing her lawn and he smokes beat up my mom and we left him and the only time I went back was to check my grandma because she was dieing and he tryed to get my mom back and he had a girl friend and he kiss my mom I got to that point if he was gonna do something bad I was gonna beat him up I don't care if he's my dad or not I would still beat him up.
Thanks for this song NLE Choppa, I am your biggest fan, I Luv this, one of your best songs yet. Keep going up... Luv this!!! 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️

Casey
My son going through this because female wanted to control him. She has her fam thinking he a bad dad, talking about him on social media calling him deadbeat. He gave money but she went and put him on child support and want let him get his son tries to control when he can see him. Now he is engaged its worst and its affecting him to the point of giving up. She left town with child without any of us knowing it and took my grandson.   Some of these females are nasty minded be careful who you sleep with unprotected. Once they got that seed its as if they feel they got a rope around you. They use the kid..seen it more then once from other families
The king🥶🥶
off beat
Meanwhile i got a bd who doesn't want to see his daughter. Missed 4 years of her life since birth. Smh.
It’s so dumb how the dads who want to see their children get the dead beat treatment keep fighting hold ur head high
I felt it🙏
It’s funny how you make a song about your child yet you ain’t never seen her also funny how you making a song yet you’re still going to court because you still ain’t paying child support or providing for your child that you created in this world that you ain’t even being a father to real funny but he get the sympathy while you can from the dumb ones
da fact det he had da chance to end det boi but gave him a letter 4 his daughter instead gotta mean some
NLE Choppa need more love cus he’s making so much songs and he can’t see his daughter
i feel the pain that you going thow u trying to be in her life she need you in her life she need her real dad in her life hope you see her soon

Im 7 I'm a. Boy love your music
This HIT 🔨 hard, haven’t seen my daughters in years, got (2) felonies behind this shit, it’s been 3 long years…‼️ Respect 🗣💯💯💯💯
Thanks for making this track,,, I have not seen my son for over 15 years. I live in Vancouver and have been paying child support all that time. FATHERS have no rights. Its seems to be ok when a women gets bitter and prevents rightful access. On that note, those mothers who, lie and do anything to prevent visits. Im not a sexist, and have healthy relationship with females & good relationship with a great lady. Its just that at the end of the day women who abuse a farthers right for what every reason, need to know. No one needs to now what happen between you and the baby farther. No body cares who right or wrong or who messed up in the relationship. ARE YOU LISTENING LADIES.... ITS WRONG TO USE THE CHILD TO PUNISH THE FARTHER... NLE CHOPPA PROPs to YOU.  And God bless your Grand Mother who watches over your angle... One more thing, the best revenge is SUCCESS***
nle is just so humble
I hope you get to see your daughter more nle gl
is so stupid how he can’t see his own daughter
When i dont have a father :/

Should’ve gotten a dog first? You still a kid yourself how you expect to raise one? The money you make doesn’t make the man that you are. Hope you get the chance to learn that one day

Rappers know of each other and the woman in the circle. And family. Know. Some things bout someone. Not all.  Mostly we know ourselves. More.  Angels. Guide you on the right path.  Spiritual side to see.  Your future what's ahead.  But through you. Eye is the body of the lamp.
You don't belong to anything of this world.  Spiritual animal kingdom cobra. And lizard.  Some. Salamanders.
Choppa your not a whore.  Your a man you only. Know more bout yourself too.   Deepest darkest secrets
Choppa look to yourself not others.
This shit hit hard
I don't like it when he down man
I felt this one ❤️ Keep your head up my guy ❤️
You'll see ur daughter again keep fighting and you'll see her
Dis song actually made me cry

This song made me cry because he suffered a loss in his life and no one should go through that❤😢
Im so sorry for loss love you gys
When they put fake charges on you I felt that my ex put so many fake charges on me and sadly I only got to see my son andrew for one year before he left this world at four years old due to a heart malfunctions and also due to the fact his mom rarely gave him his med all she cared about was ruining my life and getting high I fought so hard to try and get my son I pray you get your daughter back. #help nle choppa get his daughter back

Hi
This is a true story to me because my dad is in jail and I miss him but he told me on the phone he listens to this song all the time 😭😭🤧
:( i feel bad for you nle
Every girl and boy needs their father ♥️ nothing separates the love that they have together.
😥😪
Literally my life i love u Z💜😞
If you pay child support then you should get to see her cause  if you don't that wrong but dope song !!!
You almost me cry dawg tryna hold my tears back😭😭😭the system should definitely not let the woman keep children like that. Actin like men aren’t the reason why they had the child in the first place.
"I can't really call it pain cause I know this shit a process, God gives us challenges just to see us make some progress" that's some real shit right there
Bodied
Chopp I'm sorry for your Grandma's death😭😭😭😭R.I.P
what a song, wooooow
Bro when he said Maria can you plz complete the the wish I felt him I felt his pain so Chopp do every thing you can to get Brylie back in you arms😭😀😇

This song gives me hope for The M & The World! Rep that Bluff Bro!
Why does it even have any dislike

She left a wealthy man for a street kid. That kid could grow up and not have to worry but she doesn't want that because shes petty. lmfao

Struggles of a man! Dad wouldn’t say to much when we went through family drama. Always took side of my mom like I’m supposed to. But here as a adult I can honestly understand where my dad was coming from. Be careful who you have kids with
If NLE Choppa Dies, Here is proof that I'm not a fake fan and I loved him also listened to him before he dies
Deepest NLE Song 🔥🔥🔥
all mariah gonna do is make the child think it’s her fault and think her dad left her and she gonna be real mad at mariah when she see this

I miss my daughter too
Nle Choppa letter to my daughter lyrics  I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever record, yeah (you're so lazy) Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Ayy  In the back of the Rolls-Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls-Royce carseat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep, wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you  My hands hurt big fan
I been hearing That on Spotty

!!!!GOD!!!! MIAH!!! MASON!!!DAD!!! LOVE'S!!! YOU!!!!!!! JESUS!!! CHRIST!!! JESUS!!! CHRIST!!! JESUS!!! CHRIST!!! JESUS!!! CHRIST!!!
His daughter will grow up to love her dad not for money because he’s the one that truly loves her

all of it is mariah fault once clover gets older and understands everything mariah is gonna know why clover will turn against her SHE DIDNT EVEN GET TO SEE HER GRANDMOTHER AND SHE JUST PASSED AWAY!!
Our people have to wake up and return to our heritage as the true Isra.elites (YouTube will block my comment if I put the word right, that should tell you something) of the bible, it is the only way out of these curses. You have to see this place is Babylon and we will never have rest here. 2/3s of our people will not hear and will perish (it's written). So if God does not move your spirit to look further into this information I understand.
I’m only nine nle is my favorite rapper this is sad I want to rap at nine know🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Mad respect man 🔥
mariah let bruh see his daugter

"i'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps" let him see his daughter he deserves it it shows that he cares so much for her.
This kinda hurt because i haven't seen my father for 6 year's.
This is a good song I sent this to my dad too he can’t see me either it’s sad

Nle will still top shotta

Big respect ✊☹️💕
That's so sad that his grandma died before she got to meet her own grandchild😔
Bro drop the album plz🙏
All for you clover i turnt over a new leaf I get the type of treatment that belong to a dead beat
From Shotta flow to This, NLE has Matured so much,Am so happy he realized his true values and what really matters
This song hits so different then anything on the radio 🔥🔥
(NLE Stay real bruhh)all the the dads out there don’t give up 💪🏽 you got this
this so sad
💯💯💯 stay strong choppa u the goat
Praying for you chop. Hope it all works out bro. I gotta son I pray I get to see more
NLE I hope your old songs about murder are not true and sense I’m in the S.W.A.T I take it seriously so I hope it isn’t real
Shit make a man cry fr I’m dealing with this myself I’m feeling the same way he feel like what if I slide and kill everyone in my way but can’t bc it’ll only hurt the child I love this bro and respect you for spilling your heart out and showing a man can show feelings and still be a man at the end of the day
I need dis beat!!
https://youtu.be/40mo0i-mld0
“Id cut my feet off just to see your first steps” bro that lyric is deep….
I feel this song on another level. As a father I feel every word he spit. I see fathers get separated from their kids and fucked over by their baby mommas and it’s sickening. Some people need their children to be put on the right path. A man is 10 times better with their child around.
I got a nle be hind my head
No father should be kept from their child, no matter what mistakes were made. Keep up the grind man, luv ya
this song hits hard. This story sad. I hope you get to see her regularly man I feel you.
4:44🖤
This is a manboy, he’s only financially stable but at the same he JUST started his spiritual journey, so clear he had some demons to straighten out. So he needs to mature a bit. He doesn’t need to go bashing this girl who is low key,  living her life and raising and protecting her child from immature toxic TEENAGE behaviors. I like him a lot and get he’s expressing his feelings but in the long he gonna have to explain this to her when she’s old enough to operate YouTube (which is soon lmao)
Get this to 11 mill
Don Trip inspired. IYKYK. But this a hit also!🖤
Nle choppa sucks
NLE CHOPPA deserves to see his daughter I’m praying for you NLE
The grandpa part was a sad part
mariah said the song name is" letter to my daughter" not "letter to mariah"
bro i hate his baby momma most rappers could care less bout there kids but nle really cares
I feel bad
Man I know I’m not anything to people but go fight for your daughter she needs u bro trust me
You already know its a good song when you hear if drew didnt film it then it aint filmed right
Nle just proves he could rap to any beat this fosho get a grammy
4:23   I felt that..
I feed bad
I love the melody and beat. That saxophone is inspiring all kinds of feelings.
Nle
“Id  cut my feet off to see your first steps”
Hes Growin on me
Shits real, stay strong bro
this g went crazy on this trak
GOD BLESS YOUUUUUU....
Big cousin I'm a big fan!!!☺
cant hate on this guy
This feels like Rap is back, good Job, Dope,,💯
I’m so sorry nle you still a good father
Gotta separate my pride from feeling hit different
God bless yo grandad
this made me cry
NBA young boy if he had a daughter lol jk beautiful song definitely a legend of our generation! 🤝💯
‘’Read books till you go to you go to sleep,and mold you to a baby g, just like yo daddy
I was about to cry… being a dad and being there is everything, someday I’ll be a proud dad
Who dislike shit like this 😥😔
Keep strong choppa I hope u see yo daughter again bro bro
Thats good bro ❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
His baby mama should be thankful she had a MAN for a baby daddy that wants to see his kid. My ex sees our kids but it’s his 75 yr old mama takin care of them. She still works full time cuz he won’t work. I wish my baby dad was like him. Frfr. NLE, you an clover are in my prayers. I really hope you get to see her like you should really soon. Much love from Pittsburgh.
You are amazing brother
This the first song I heard from him with out gang stuff in it but this hit different
How tall is he damn lol
Get a lower

Real talk...

Love yo songs mab
Wow
This right here is some the realist shit I’ve heard from a young nigga his age💪🏿💪🏿🔥🔥🔥‼️‼️I go through it too keep yo head up lil homie push forward
I don’t get why people hating on this song, I guess some people won’t realize when a man is trying to change into a better man
Instead of making rap, he made a personal level song.
Would you film Shadow flow 6 with Jake Paul
DAMN MAN just hold on tight u will get to see her u got this Plus the song is fire 🔥 😍 👌👌
I see a real bright future for you Choppa, you a shining star in a world full of darkness never let this darkness overcome you my brother💯 we're all rooting for you
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺
All she needs is support
https://youtu.be/ucQvwv1slEU
much love brodie
dang bro i really feel bad for this man he deserves better he want to jail on the same day he went to see hes daughter dang never happened.
Dang i feel you bro that’s tuff
He wants to be a father but she doesn’t she only wants to put him on Child Support Smh
I cried to this song🥺😭😭😭
Spam nle if he a goat nle nle nle nle nle
3:13 sounds like x
i damn near shed a tear
Best music comes from the heart
For ppl it’s hard to see nle as a father, but he’s telling us how he feels with not seeing his daughter and with the other mothers and fathers that can’t see there child. God will help u nle keep that in mind my dude. Keep ur head up high and that includes everyone
I went to see my daughter hurt me when he call him daddy
Bruh i feel u man. I almost cried when hearing this. Every single father has a right to see his child. This just hits hard.
Sounds like he's constantly off beat. Is that what the kids like these days??
Bruh ion gone cap u a reap father u could go get more hoes and u choose to take care and keep tryin 💪💪100
This hits me hard dawg, he really loves his daughter
He really started singing at the end im in tears 😭 🥰
Give him his daughter back 🙏
NLE CHOOPA AND BRYLY
I hope you get your daughter back bro imma pray 🙏 🙏
I love NLE Choppa
Wow beautiful song real talk... This world is wicked that fact that 3.5k disliked these lyrics video etc is crazy I want to believe it was true dead beat boys and selfish bay mother's worldwide
I just have respect for NLE CHOPPA and NBA YOUNGBOY
This song really make me cry when i  listen to it and every day i listen to it even tho    my brother be telling me i making  the song sound bad
This is a nice remix of Don trips "letter to my son". That's actually how I found this jam.
Damn man I feel it
Lord bless NLE Choppa that he gets to see his daughter💜
Man, this hit me on personal level. This song really digs deep about what I’m going through. I have the same relationship with my dad
Eminem in paralelle UNWRS
Nice
My respect 🙏 to my GOAT Choppa💯❤️❤️
His face Look Fake
4:10 Where Your Hands Go...
Keep it up Chopp
Damn this really made me so sad. It’s hurtful to a child when they don’t get to meet parents that has wanted to see them and the other parent keeps away. Don’t be that woman or man. Unless you know the child will be in danger do not keep a child away from their other parent. It’s not fair to that child and you will keep them from a whole family that would love to give them love! I know this isn’t always the case but if you know it is the case then let that child be loved!
you gon make a good dad .❤
Man bro this hurt 😔
Man this hurt bro😔
Keep fighting through man. Its all a process. God gives us challenges to see us make some progress. Keep your head up
I hope his wishes come true
I hope da best for him
Rip NLE
Aye man I hope you get to see your daughter soon Chop 💯 watching this made me cry not gonna lie I especially felt that I part about wanting to have a child to live for I felt that part the hardest R.I.P to yo grandma
Bro this hit hard🔥 choppa is a real story teller keep you head up💯
Bruh I cried bro I listen to this on my daughter bday bruh and ha ppl think bad about me but Ima make it better❤️‍🩹💯
P.s not said this in reactions but all for you clover I turns over a new leaf 0:59
Letter to My Daughter / NLE Choppa I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever record, yeah (you're so lazy) Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Ayy  In the back of the Rolls-Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls-Royce carseat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep, wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you   THANK ME LATER :)

I became a father 9 year's ago. At 17...been out on my own since. Got 5 kid's now. 2 of them I don't get to see cause of the mother and my past. It's sad cause my daughters are the ones suffering the most. I miss my babies and I do all I can do and some just like the next guy. Fellas keep your head up n don't give up no matter what
Wow Chop this song is AMAZING and you did a great thing making it. Made me cry. Prayers for you and yours, Top Shotta.
Paring ever day for
That shit made me cry
Hard shit yo ❤️
Keep your head up Choppa. They don’t appreciate the good ones til its too late. Nor do they realize they are hurting the child more than anything.

Rest in peace Ms. Potts
This bussin
This sheeit is to deep....
one thing i know is my daughter been 17 years with her pops in out of prison. No bday or holidays. It's not easy when it could have been better. I pray this young lady gives this young man a chance because baby girl deserves both parents in her life. I'm def gonna be prayin 4  choppa and his daughter to have an unbreakable bond.
Anyone can rap about sex, drugs,money,opps,murd3r ETC.... At this point it's all regurgitated!!! But how many artist will open up and SPEAK ON REAL SHIT LIKE THIS!!  This is beautiful CHOPPA YOU DID YOUR THING ON THIS ONE❤❤❤💯👀 🙏🙏🙏
❤️
Best rapper from Memphis period.
Love
My dad’s going through the exact same thing to see my baby brother
" long term relations for short term greed, just be careful what you pick when your the one that's in need"  THIS SONG HAS SO MANY GEMS IN IT THAT CAB BE USED THROUGH ALL WALKS OF LIFE!! IT'S BEAUTIFUL
" read book till you go to sleep, wake up make you sumthin to eat, mold you to a baby g just like yo daddy" .. " tryna put me on child support, all a child needs is support!! Woulda gave you more than child support could  eva.  afford  !!!"
This is wholesome.

who tf can dislike this song
Really hit home for the real fathers who want their kids going threw it.. thanks for this song 🎧 👏👏
I'm waiting for stotta flow 6
This reminds me of Bryson😂
gas
Mariah really did this 😠😠 cause they said based on a true story (not trying to start a fight
If there ever a song that real life is speaking too me & my life RN, when it comes too my Baby-Momma &&& My Dooterz, ***Kaelahni-Daniels*** I Miss You &&& I Love You ***K.K.*** Daddy is 4EVER here for you & yours, no matter what the time, place & OR situation brings us ETC....! Keep being the Dope ASF. Big ASF. 3 Year Old that I've ever been around & OR witnessed in this Old 28 Years of A Life-Time of mine .... !!!!!
Made me cry! Haven’t got to see my son but 6 hours in 2 years thanks to his dad. We talk and FaceTime every week but it’s not quite the same.. all I can tell you is she won’t be little forever, one day she’ll make up her own mind about you and hopefully she won’t grow up resenting her mom for being petty and robbing her of the opportunity to grow up with a father who wants to be present and play an active role in his daughter’s life, something all too many men regularly neglect to do. I loved the mural of you two in her room, so cute! She’s adorable! Stay up! xoxo 💖💖💖
por choppa cant see his daughter n he got arested when he tride
banger of song, but that that chicks eyes r on the outside of her skul.. #Fish4Life

Nle is the 🐐
i felt this and i aint even got a kid
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🤧🤧🤧
A quick inspiration - Nothing that has happened to you is a surprise to God. God’s hand is always on you. He’s ordering your steps. If the door is closed, it was supposed to be closed. If the person walked away, they were supposed to walk away. Don’t get upset, keep moving forward. God has already worked the situation out. He has something greater in store for you. Declare by faith, “it is  already done” 💕.

I like it Bryson
Nle trying  his best
Wow that was so great and almost cry cuz I lost family members
🔥🔥
Put him on child support because she a gold digger
I know that baby mama is watching and reading these comments..girl he’s trying..Let him see his daughter. One day she will grow up and ask YOU if YOU did everything you could to keep her father in her life and what are you gonna tell her then? If he’s shown violence in front of her over something going on between you and him, he can be supervised during the visit. But don’t use the baby as a pawn. There’s always a way if you want it..
that cop trippin
damn this made me cry
I feel bad for x man
Song
Bro I was crying to this
This make me cry bro😌
This song gave me to much goosebumps
My mom did my  bad
My did it to my dad and we live with her bf I can't  see him when I was 5 I'm  9 you  see this I know how it feel
It made  me cry  im not going to lie  no cap  im happy  for  you  nle choppa  BTW you  my favorite  rapper I love you  ❤❤I  hope  you  see your  daughter  😘
This is why we love choppa…
The battle of what has been lost by so many of our youth. Teach a man you teach an individual, but teach a woman you teach a generation. Im sorry that forces of evil are scared of you, and work against you to discredit, humilate, and silence. A repeat of the 90s. My father...Was taken from me from the same administration in office today.....And they're doing it again.....
So sorry man I want to wish you better hope you get full justice on your daughter respect you man ✌✌✌
This was a hit and RIP
Like father like daughter
Nle choopa
nle choppa  is one of the best out here no cap
He took don trip shit to a new level
Bryson im only 11 and I haven't seen my father in 3 years so I have to deal with it to,me and you are on the same page.and my dad went to jail to try to see me
you a true king and you have came a long the way we are all so proud of what you have done and we hope you get to see your daughter
damn this is really messed up, that child needs a daddy.
Man I feel his pain just let him see his baby girl he's singing his heart out to you and you still being a bitch man that's tuff. Let NLE see his baby
This is fire
Bro I deadass shed a tear. My baby will always have her daddy. I know it's hard when you're in this situation but men, PLEASE, take care of the ones you brought into this world. Put your pride to the side and take care of your responsibility.
GG choppa
Nle
Yea now is so nice
Miss You In My Arms 🙏🤒
Poor males and females that go trough the same struggles☹️Nle choppahas to go to court everyday:(
This has to be the realest song I've ever heard in my life. Too many people sleeping on nle man. Sure, he might do some crazy stuff sometimes but he is truly one of the best in the game, and to realize that this man is only 18 is crazzy. We need to protect him at all costs cause he has a great life ahead of him. Nle is so underrated
All the dirt bag "dad's" on here acting like they can connect with this
Good father and good prayers
Moriah need to forgive a G
I don't understand but this is what I think: you leaved crip to take care of your daughter and now your girlfriend leaved you and took your daughter and you got arrested. If I wasn't right please tell me the right answer and if I was right just say yes
W
This song hit different and so sad

🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🥳❤
I miss you Nylah and Khalil ❣️❣️
🙏😞🙏😞🙏😞🙏😞🙏😞🙏😞
I feel bad 😞😞😞🙏🙏🙏
This song is a masterpiece!! Being raised by a single hard working black father, I can attest to how beautiful and important this bond is for a little girl. I can also empathize with the father's who are restricted from seeing their child/children because of the immaturity and lack of vision from some grown people. It is sad, because at the end of the day most of us are doing the best we can and the bottom line is that it's all about the children. God bless the beautiful fathers around the world. May you be at peace, may you be loved and may you be treated respectfully. Love and Light... J
I felt that
you can only here this from a real g
Pls dont quit rapping
This shit was real chop frl big respect
I love nle I'm a rapper fight for your  child
This hits I know how you feel bro I gotta 12 year old son that I don't know never got to see him because of his mom
Try to do the right thing but get played to the left😔
the mom has actual jealous isues wish i was kidding
My dad had to fight my momma for custody for so long when she was on drugs . She put him on child support too . The only reason he got us when he did was cause he convinced my mom to give us up to him .
I feel so sorry for him 😢😢😓😓
That you lost your  daughter
I’m sorry
Dawg. Sending love and prayers for you and the fam.  This is beauty written.
Why are is lady's so mad at our baby daddy's to the point where yo baby daddy gon kill himself. My momma did that to my older sis dad my dad and my younger sis dad she be trippin

Bruh who dislike this shit this shit is real bars
rip
Mane fuk dis shi
Whoever disliked this has no sole. This song is amazing and has so much meaning and needs to get his daughter in his arms.
This shit hits🔥
I can’t help but shed a tear on this track cause it’s Tooooo Mannny Fathers that want to be there to raise their daughters and sons but stand in the way of Hateful and Demonic Baby mommas or X’s! It’s something needs to be addressed across the judicial system for Fathers that want to be there but are FORCED AWAY!
I feel u bro
2:56 I can see the pain in his eyes 😔
🙌🙌🙌
Love the message behind this song🔥🔥🔥
Yes
What kinda gun is that?
You a good pearson

I like this song
The song came from the heart and I hope it’s a lesson to other young men one if you’re going to be sexually active strap up unless you know that the person you’re with you have intentions of either one marrying or coparenting properly because these are the types of things that end up happening you have to think not for the moment but what could potentially happen and protect yourselves accordingly
when u know all the lyrics
Don trip letter to my son good shit nle
Tryna be a co parent turned me into a no parent feeling like a transparent Wht happened to your grandparents that one went dumb

Man i love this young man music he deep  actually can relate to what he saying. I feel that man pain when you know you a good father but have the wrong baby mama. I salute that man keep up the good work cause he actually been talent at a young age before he came out. he came a long way
My mom was my dad's 3rd marriage. He was an older man. But he was so violent we had to leave. I never heard from him again and didn't see him until he was already dead. It's crazy to see this youngster flexing fatherhood like this. God bless this young man.
Protect man and daughter at all costs

It's called family court. That's where parents go to fight for the right to see their children. Both parents have equal rights. Men gotta stop making excuses.
All of NLE choppa songs are fire! I wouldn’t be listening to rap if it wasn’t for him! Thank u!
I really hope you get to see your daughter bless nle
Please no pitty for a G 🙏🏼😢

Mariah needs to come off her ego trip  Watched her video and tbh if my  bm was her I’d be going for custody straight up!! Her attitude to her language in front of her child speaks for itself... I pray you get to work it out before it’s too late and she grows up with that missing feeling

I don't have kids but choppa I feel u keep your head up it will get better believe me 💯
nleeeee choppaaaaa
I felt Chills from the power of this one!!
Nothing but respec for choppa he really been on his grind just to see his daughter 👏💙
Guys nle chopper was forced to sell his soul hear me out so in the song protect read the lyrics he says protect your mind and soul and don’t leave the house without my crystals these crystals protect u but keep on listening so he also says there’s a topic that needs to be unmuted what he means is the groverment is hiding secrets and he knows and in protect he’s basically exposing the government but if you think bout it people who sell there soul sing about sex drugs and Violet reason why is because the government wants to fuck with your mind make you do those things and he sings bout drugs sex and all in final warning and he doesn’t wanna say theses things even in this song read the lyrics he says protect your soul or something like that and he was sent to Jain for no reason
It sad cuz she not trying to help you she just sending more hate calling yo mom fat and musty? B's be tripin these days
Mariya tripin on god😭
That's not fair his  great grandma died without meeting her great granddaughter bro if I was nle I would literally  pay Mariah a ton of money just to see my daughter for a good amount of time but guys stop holding back the kids from the father or mother like I understand if their abusive but nle I a really soft guy who even tatted his leg his perfect leg for his daughter that he can't see I'm pissed he can't see her but god help plz and nle get some custody

Now listening to his lyrics he’s a hypocrite you’re telling your daughter never to lower her standards and that you will come after any man that disrespects her but look what you’re doing to her mother make it make sense again capping  clout chasing it is finest what I know I work a bum 9-5
He copied damn near bar for bar Quando Rondo lyrics even the same tittle song smh and copied his video concept when are people going to be original creators and come up with their own ish This is truly been the generation of copycats like this ain’t even funny no I’m not saying he’s not a talented artist but come on man give credit where credit is due say you was inspired by this man I don’t know this is why I don’t do new generation music I stick with my old school music at least they are original and they give credit where credit to this new generation of new wave of gangsta rap don’t know how to write talk about a lifestyle they never live in punk fake everything
My dad left me when I was 4 I’m 12 now it ain’t fun not seeing ur dad everyday like I was used to,so much fun memories

One thing I will always thank my mom for is she never once spoke bad on my dads name! 💯 never once did she tell my dad he couldn’t see me or my siblings! For whatever moms out here need to hear this: do not do this to your children. Let them make their own decisions of how they feel about people. Don’t give them your hate. 💔

im exited for the court case when they find that mariah lied and hopefully she gets arrested for fraud the  brylie is choppa's but the justice system sucks so ya but if its to the point where u barely see brylie and that is fight for custody while little brylie is young becuase if u do it when shes 5 or up she will be able to know the conflict so if u do it i would do it rn but im praying for u
Best song of his lyric wise. He better give Don Trip his props he used his line from letter to my son

🔥🔥🔥😉😉😉😉✊✊✊
said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever record, yeah (you're so lazy) Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Ayy  In the back of the Rolls-Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls-Royce carseat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep, wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love

Chop still on top wid all his music bro and I’m prayin for u to keep yo head up G love you bro
Bro it’s not that hard go too court
damn listening to this for a 2nd time and this hit hard
This Hit The Soul . Felt Every Bit Of It 💯
why she will not let her ex see his kid so dumb
As always without words
i have the same name as his daughter
WoW
jeez nle, we all praying for you homie😞
I know its a serious song but when he said "Every time i try to do right thing i get played tonthe left" and his voice cut to only the left ear i lowkey cracked up😂😂
For real for real this song is deeper then a person’s deepest secret
I CRIED 😭😭😭😭😭
That made me cry right there
any tik tok mf who turns this into a challnge finna die bro
💙🤍💜❤🤩😍
This making me cry a little bit
Well done bro🤟🏼💚🛃 slatt
I send this to my father and he say:i am crying rn!!🥰nle choppa this song is perfect for every dad!we love you choppa❤
Mariah is cancled got caught in 4K no letting him see his daughter even if he wasn’t father still let him seen her and not only that nigga said he chop his feet off just to see her that’s just real shit Mariah if u read this don’t act u didn’t prevent him from seeing his daughter
Hes telling us that life isn’t easy for everybody and how hard he’s trying to keep his daughter safe. If you switch the L with the N in nle you will get LNE and in my book that stands for Love Never Ends. He has lots of gut to talk about something this personal. Pay him and his family respect.💙❤️💙❤️💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 stay strong NLE.
Damn I felt that ,frl frl
Can't even see yo on child bruh that's sad you would be a great dad
How tf people gunna dislike when he singing to his daughter disrespectful
I feel like the more you listen to this song the sadder it gets
Real savage shit here
“A nigga call yu sum else I’m correcting his grammar” big facts 💪🏾
Ye him and his bm got issues but a father that wants to be in the kids life should be able to mine pays 42 dollars in child support
I listen to this like 20 time and it came out last week

Refreshing to hear a rap song that doesn't talk about money, sex, murder or drugs.
I used to not let my daughter daddy see her and I end up feeling bad about it. Every kid should know their parents
Bro I’m on my mama this shit hit my heart
Keep it trending

"Evertime I try to do right I get played to the left" 😞😭

Great song!! NLE .. Felt this, I relate to this. Dealing with this! I could Never Get to See My 5 year old Daughter. because the mother but i aint Mad. i just really wish i Could see her, Not even a Letter, video, or photos....thats how fucked up its got me! im trying my best to get custody but im loosing this battle!...and im only a 25year old. and because of that, she aint gonna ever know me! that hurts on a level i can't explain not worth living for.
Damn what a fire song. You are truly inspirational! Keep the positivity because it is changing many lives. Keep fighting for what you believe and stay strong 💪
You did that fam 💯💜🔥

Don't worry she can't hold you from your daughter forever I don't get why females be like that every girl or a boy needs a father to females  can't  Always do it by themselves regardless of what they think
Son this song is 🔥🔥🔥but I know I’m not  trippin but is the NBA YoungBoy’s valuable pain beat

Stuff hurts To Death When You Can't your Son Or daughter
Man that hits hard. You're talented bro
Right when he said the walls fallin' down, I heard I loud bang on my wall.
You do not deserve this man. Her mother shouldn't be doing you like this. It's tough, and i know what your going through, as I used to be one of those kids, and I felt my dad's pain. So please stay strong, I know one day God will bless you with the gift of having custody of your daughter. You got this man. 👍

Shoutout to Don Trip for doing it first! NLE definitely paying homage!
💥💥💥 no pitty for a G
Dis hard
Had to put myself on child support just because that was the only way I could get my rights as a father.. i had gone  6 months without seeing my daughter before I got my first court ordered visit with her (she remembered my voice and it was such an amazing feeling).. now she is 1 year and 3 months..and every 1st 3rd and 5th Saturday i see her from 12-5..she is my best friend..and fighting for her was worth every scar.
If drew didnt film it it wouldnt be filmed right first time heard it from lil loaded song
Currently going throught the same this song kuts deep!
Choppa is a good father
‘Ain’t seen you since the week you was born, miss you in my arms’ that hit me hard man. I’m sorry brother
I hope God blesses y'all
Ayo RIP to your Grandma
❤️ we love you bro, this song almost had me crying❤️
Awe yea dat man grew up
That's the deepest lyrics you every wrote💔
Don Trip Proud Fasho 💯

This so sad that even my lil brother watching dis and he dont even know anything about this
This go hard!
I know it hurts inside
you got family over here your daughter she mean a lot to you I know
This too shall pass coming from a female perspective and a therapist with a master's degree in psychology... it is best that both of you are on the same page to get there it takes time. You all should try co parenting canceling! Everyone has there side of the story but it's the child side of the story that matters! Meaning both of you being mindful of what her precious eyes and ears see and hear. Make sure both of your og's are on the same page they will make good mediators.l! Peace and blessings you will make it through! ❤
Great song
Where my gang that prays for nle
Dad vs mom

Until she learns
You know what we should make a protest to wear nle keeps  and shows the baby mama how it is to be alone and depressed without a child so she know how nle feels
All he want to do is spend time with his father
So sad man
The easy kitty superficially reach because debtor interestingly thaw as a vigorous bankbook. harmonious, endurable step-uncle
Sorry you do not deserve your 1 of my fav im so sorry I'm in tears

1:35 DRAKE

Cool MEN
this is so deep!
“If drew didn’t film it, then it ain’t filmed right.” So, Cole Bennet doesn’t film right?
This is deep KEEP ON FIGHTING FOR.YOUR.DAUGHTER!
My favorite song by you💜
Just let him see his daughter and rip I'm trying to be like you
I literally cryed this reminded me of when my mom took me and my 8 month old sister from my dad for a month and I did know what happened
NLE don't stop fighting ✊
DEAR NLE: Prayers up for you & your daughter bro!  Keep fighting to stay in her life & never give up king! God Bless!
Damn this shit made tear
'”Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings”
This is one of the realist songs I've ever hear Choppa. Dayyyyyum ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
If the father is willing and wants to be in that babys life to support and provide, then there should be no need for child support. Only reason a chick would want child support in that situation is if she wanted to keep that man further than arms length from his baby, and that just says more about her than him at that point.
Bro his ex better give him his baby back
Hard🔥 and the homage to don trip
This the best song nle ever made
2:59 the smiler thoo
Tell Me Why I Love This Mane So Much I Even Love His Momma But Keep Yo Head Up Bro Love Ya!!..
My mans just tryna see his daughter it aint fine if his daughter grows up without a father i can bet Choppa is the best father you could ever ask for
😭😭😭😭😭 so sad

Now that's how u rap! *Will Smith voice*
Rip mattie.....
I feel bad but keep fight for your daughter I love you
Who else came from the baby mama video😐😭
If you did give a like lemme know sum I felt that love ❤
I feel as though you made this song also for the mothers who got kept away from they're kids without a choice due to miscarriage/abortions

i felt this one more than your song depression keep on fighting to see your beautiful daughter
Crazy how they do the father of the child and be quick to say he not shit then the child grow up resenting him cause of something the momma did
Got you in my prayers man, its fucked up how she took your daughter away. Karma gonna come around and solve this
✨ Bitter Baby Moms Are nevergood may the lord protect they daughter
Got me real live crying man this shit just hit me omds some I’m going through rn‼️💔😞
This song hit home hard I haven’t seen my baby girl since she was born
I wish my father cared about me like this , I haven't seen him for almost 2 years and even if I do he never said " I got your back ", all what I want is to feel that I really have  a dad who  cares about me
let him see he's daughter how would you feel if you haven't seen your daughter/son you would feel so shamed let Choppa see he's daughter
If ya look he actually had a gone when  gave the dude the letter in his pocket
“Letter to my daughter, I hope you know you have a father, remember those late nights, swim like an iguana”
May god let you see your Daughter❤️💯
#NLEgetshisDaughter
bruh im crying hard asf dis shit fr life
Biggest song i ever heard
When you now realize everything he said in the song was true and he explained it all in the live and he’s just being framed and feels for his daughter and wit all due respect if you gon have a kid especially a girl, she’s gon need her father. Your just hurting her more. Stay true to yo self nle stay strong bro

My name wouldve been in another mans name if it weren't for my dad fighting his whole life proving I'm his son cuz he had me at a young age but now he made it and we sit back and laugh at the times we struggled but we made it fr to anyone struggling with custody problems all I gotta say is keep fighting for your kid my dad been fighting for me since 14 he been to jail and back for me and I love him to death for that.
If u dislike this u have no heart
rip to your grandmother
I am sorry for you nle
We Love You Choppa💜

Atleast he try’s🥺🥺🥺
🔥🔥🔥
dam dis man went from dancing like a mf chicken to being so inspirational
Lord he is a angel hese going heavean good father
imagine his daughter years later saying to choppa''daddy this guy hurt me''...
when we all realize when now came into the rap game he was barely old enough to play gta 5
Beat is on point
Ya
This was amazing. We need more artist like Choppa ❤️
choppa is real bruh 🫂
NLE Choppa legend 👑
U can hear the pain in his voice 😭😭😭😭😭😭
But take your time just know people are waiting
When you gonna drop another album
poor chop keep it up bro i been a fan since u had the top shotta flow tat
bruh how mariah call this a "diss song" when he dissed no one in this song
Is going to get better Chopper
this touched my soul.. felt this on more of a personal level 💔
He meant it Fr in his song picture me grapin, when he say  “my bm really b on bs I’m asking god y I got these problems on this…”  this sum RNS righhh eree thou💯 Respec it
Mariah whatever her name is  Just know that if you don’t fix that things by the time she grows up  She’s gonna be listening to this song almost everyday thinking about her daddy and that’s when she’ll start to hate you with all of her heart I promise… did you see how he mentioned her grand parents ? Let’s say by the time she turns 15 her parents are no longer there and she has never got to spend time with them  Who do you think she will blame? Your kid is gonna hate you  I’m fucking telling you
Real on a whole another level....big ups for all paps out there that don't get a chance to raise they tots😶😕
Let him see his child please😭
So sad
Stay strong Nle When ur young u go with dumb stuff in ur mind to do just like x but at rollin loud he said when ur YOUNG u make stupid decisions😥
Had me crying
said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever record, yeah (you're so lazy) Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Ayy  In the back of the Rolls-Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls-Royce carseat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep, wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you
The people that disliked gotta be the baby mommas that don’t let  the father see his  kid
Damn
Alrighty….

medin italy ebellissima
I wish I had the ability to fight for my daughter, and take measures to secure my role as a father in my daughters life but I feel like I'm always on square 1 and no matter what I do I feel like I'm always behind, I'd do anything to give my daughter the future she deserves, thanks for the song and showing love nle choppa but I promise you things will change with or without the world at your back, just gotta sit back and stack, but in my opinion if I had just the slightest amount of help from you, I'd be able to do everything I dream of. So keep your head high, gotta make these miracles come true for yourself because I absolutely don't believe anyone shows love like that anymore.
Until I heard this I didn't think homie had bars... this shit hard and real
Best song by him..
Your love for your daughter shines through the darkest night. Keep your head up Chop. If you reading this pray for all the Fathers that are hurting.
Powerful 🖤🦍
this is a beautifully created song AND video. it gave me chills
Keep your head up Choppa!
Not my crying the whole time omg I love chappa and he deserves way more I hope he gets to keep her aww
How old is she
His baby momma did the most on her ig calling him a bitch and saying he ain’t want his daughter but if it wasn’t for him she wouldn’t even be known. This why you just don’t have a child with anybody

Guys don’t go to Hell. If you see this comment it is God sending you a warning before it is too late. Jesus is coming soon. Get right with God. If you decide to follow Jesus after he saves Christians from the hard times that are coming. You will have to die for your faith. Accept Jesus before it is too late brothers and sisters.
NLE choppa is rap game's Gandhi
You don't deserve to be separated from your daughter, you're doing the right thing to fight for her and you should continue to fight for her because she is yours. I'm sorry you have to go through this, seeing you fight this hard for her is really sad. I love you, and stay on your grind! 🥺❤️

Really feeling this one still going through the same wif my 2year old daughter
Personal she is Beautiful
NLE my dad is going through the same this keep your head up bro
Good Dads,  My brother went to court and got custody of his daughter. I realize everyone can’t do that, but continue to fight. Kids need their fathers, more than ever!!!!
best song of this moment greetings from holland
This man spitting facts even for a break up still ballin strong and his name still out here in a positive acted I love this man this hit me different💜🔥
All children deserve parents not all parents deserve children.. The worst thing you can do is keep a baby away from their father, that will break a man. Get NLE Choppa and Flight their custody and take the rights of custody away from these petty creatures called "mothers".
I have goosebumps so hard damn

No child should be treated like a toy!!!!!!! Just bc things don’t work out don’t mean u keep a kid away from the parent. Woman that do that are fucked up in the head. They hurt no one but the kid!

Hopefully she ain't calling him daddy, ya boys will be on him harder than simps
I can tell you will be a great dad keep fighting
Im not crying😓😭😭..damn bro you went hard on this🔥🔥

When you have that chance to have your kid make sure you take good care of them because they have love and feeling to
Lmk how every song and every vid the homie drops is always trending top 10. Mostly top 5 but nobody say nuthin bout it?!??
“Might not hear your first words and it’s hurting me to death/deaf” that shit hits way different 💪🏿🔥🔥

O.G
Started listening to this song the day it was released can’t skip a day without it 🔥
Ik what you  going through
Yessirr choppa Ben a goat
Dude you need to get custody of the girl.
No cause the fact that he’s tryna fight for his daughter is everything, there’s a lot of men out there, not even just men women too, that don’t want nothing to do with they child. Parents will complain about how their child doesn’t have a dad (or mom) but others won’t let their child see they father. Let him see his daughter man
This niggga really snapped

NLE is only 18 years old, and instead of him dipping out and leaving his kid to the mother, he's fighting just to be in her life. Not only that, he made this song to explain his story and tells us he wants to be the best dad possible and support that girl no matter what, mad respect for you NLE Choppa ❤

Hi
You can see that choppa loves his kid more than himself and he even says he would cut off his feet to see her first steps. That has my respect what so ever.
I never thought that I could cry from a rap song-
💪💪💪🙃🙃
I hate he going thru this but I got faith I kno shit gone get better you got supporters NLE 🥺💯🤞🏽
This almost made me cry we all make mistakes in the past but we can correct them like choppa did
https://youtu.be/BCKOD-5muo4
He a real one coz he able to put the street shit aside to speak some truth but niggas also know not to fuck with him.
I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever quote (You're so lazy) Yeah Letter to my daughter (Yeah, yeah) I'm just tryna be your father (Yeah) Ayy  In the back of the Rolls Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls Royce car seat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you growin' up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way (Ayy) I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from their toddlers Read books until you go to sleep Wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you
He took a few bars from don trips i just wanna see my son song... deff been there before.  My son now 15 and we have a great bond

God bless you for coming on this Earth keep doing what you doing

no idea what happened
Ídolo...
I miss you too. I'll send you a picture of Hayden from his last day of fifth grade but I need to tell you something. I love talking to you and I would love to see you some time but I dont want to talk about Hayden- I dont blame you for wanting to because he's your son and im his sister so yk it makes sense but Hayden doesn't want to be a part of all this. He wants to be left out. He hasn't seen you in 3+ years and he doesn't want to. I dont want to keep reminding him of you if he's not going to see you again/ if he doesn't want to. When he's older he might change his mind. Also before you say anything its not Stephanie's fault. She's told me that she asked Hayden what he wanted and this is what he said. Its sad but probably better for him. I'll send a pic in another message and just know that I love you so much💜 Thank you for never giving up on us. ........thats a letter from my daughter. ive always fought for my kids but sometimes somethings can be beyond us. our job is to perservere in the meantime
My your Granny rest in paradise NLE may god bless you many many more respect 🙏💜
did drake arrest u
NLE Choppa has changed my life ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Idk how this has 2 thousand dis likes. Haters have notis and I don’t know how u dislike this. It’s a great song and even if u don’t like it u have to respect that he’s telling a real story. If u dislike this u is a real hater
Looking through the comments to find a hate comment just so I can tell them how stupid they is
I needed this.
Ik im 6 days late but sheeeshhhh it's low-key fire and it's also sad that it's a true story rip:(
Dis ain't rite choppa keep ur head up one fail and may be the biggest mistake we luv u 💜💜
Write Don Tripp a a checc 😒
I did not know he could sing I wanna hear more of that from him
I mean he did try to kill his bm

his daughter is the best for him
Nle choppa is so talented he does sign language for people who can't hear

The way Choppa will die is not be able to hear his daughter call him dad 😔
You is a like flower 🌸 just startin to bloom Personality of a goddess, get it from her grandmother , girl I hope dad gets to see you soon. Keep yo head held high time has been wasted and Ik it can’t be bought I hope I get to help raise you before your grown and distraught
The beginning reminded me of B03
He shouldn’t have to go through this shit. Let choppa see his daughter😭

NLE earn my respect with every song

I cried listening to this one, my mom never let my father see me and finally after 16 years I finally got to see him this year after never seeing him my whole life my mother always talks down on him and it hurts hearing her say things that aren't true she just hates him and he's been trying since being a father of 11 it's just hard for him at times he recently left because I said something to his wife because she was drunk and driving around with all the kids I haven't seen him in a week I'm scared that I hurt are relationship I didn't mean to make him mad I was just fearful that something might happen and he's dying I just don't know what to do.

Focus on love brother, much respect 🙌
Aye in da bac of da rolls cannot enter wit yo shoes on ] I felt dat lyric mane it's a shame he can't see his own daughter already bad enough wit Corona Mariah as got clever calling another nigga daddy what type of women is dat bruh 🥱 let dis mane she her t he can like y u out him through all dat wtf wrong witchu!
🔥
🔥
The song is fire I felt this for real
🔥🔥
Some kids don’t even have a father And She want her to go through that Stage.And Mariah however you spell it no disrespect She Got this bf playing step father knowing she has a real Father that’s trying his hardest to be in his daughter Life.He said he sorry fa his mistake❤️💯.Im proud That he wanna step up Because some fathers don’t care so💯💯
Bruh u walked out of a Nissan but u can get a whole Lambo
This track smells like bitter baby mama
awwwwwwwwwwww i am crying
Yo NLE man I already know you the good guy in this situation because what woman won’t let a man see their daughter when he helped make her? Keep fighting man you gonna win!
Hi
Big facts ❤️ NLE CHOPPA  the best 🔥🔥🔥
Is very sad and I'm glad that you get to see your daughter and by the way your daughter look cute
Lord please protect this young man so he can continue to get these messages out to us who need it🤞🏽💯
I don’t wanna be a asshole or nun but dude you said the baby wasn’t yours. Then you tried to shoot her afterwards. How do you expect her to be cool with you?. I feel like this is for clout. You acted like you were cleaning up your image and you’re still promoting the same shit that destroys black communities. I wish people weren’t so blind. This man could’ve called Mariah or went to court. Instead he puts y’all in his business while Mariah has been out of the media since she had the baby.
Fly high miss Potts 🕊
Go watch boss game blade
As always- I know Good music when I hear it!! 🙏
Being from Memphis I am so proud of NLE and the way he has matured with his music and as a man!
COME ON Itz fire but the beat is durks and the lyrics are Don Trips  JS #DonTrip Letter to my son Dropped 9 years ago!!
In my opinion I don’t believe the mother should have the power to say oh you cant see your daughter no matter what and then complain that the father does nothin for the child
Hope dat boy paid he homage to DON TRIP. NO PITY FOR A G 🧏🏾‍♂️
NLE is one hardworking man an has changed alot an is willing to fight for his daughter 💙💯

"THE MARATHON MUST CONTINUE"  NIPSEY x NLE 🙏🏼❤
Man  and all of this is on a bases story dam bro
This song is too good
NLE I watched your live from 5 days ago discussing your issues with your baby mother and the courts. I also left comments that will really help you especially with #COURT....COURTS ARE ALL COMMERCIAL VENUES and its all #CORPORATION VS #CORPORATION (contracts) THEY CANNOT DEAL WITH THE ACTUAL LIVING SOUL so instead you, unknowingly subject yourself to they're jurisdiction. They can only deal with your all CAPS name BRYSON POTTS which is a Corporation as well. Also if any claim was made against you (saying you committed a crime)there has to be an actual human being to step forward validating that claim(at that point its a civil matter).....NOT THE STATE OF (ANY STATE) because a STATE cannot speak. It's a fictional entity therefore there is no crime. Case dismissed👌🏿 hopefully you see this and reach out via my IG #DevonTheGod or my Facebook Travis Slaton. Peace&Love God
Man that's sad
Dang it man NLE Choppa  im gon prey for you man this made me cry 😢 man im gonna prey for you your awesome  NLE Choppa

Hey nle your one of the most realest rappers I've ever seen,  you have a lot of fame and money but the thing u want the most is to see your daughter.  You dont care about nothing, not the money, not the fame ,just your daughter you will get through it and at the end of the day no matter what is going on between the mother and father they should put their differences aside and let the other person see their kid bc nobody in the world shouldn't aloud to see their kid . Eventually hopefully she'll let you see your daughter and I'm praying for you every day that she will let you bc your a good guy. My friend went through this to so I know how u feel 🙏🙏🙏
let my homie see his kid cuz dats rude i have 1 and mt baby mama took her away from me
Only song I’ve teared up too 😔
If you babymama be cool
Nle can I plz follow me back on ig I’m a big fan and I can rap
And hope you get to see her and mariaha
i have a babygirl over in the states but her mom dont let me see her last time i did i got the cops called on me becuase the guy anwsered with a glock i beat the shit out of him this song speaks to me
Choppa if I was grown I will not put my hands on a girl not saying you did but if I was in this same thing I will be sad I'm sad for you man

Wassup choppa, I get what u mean when I was hella young my mom did not let me see my dad for a while but after a while she started slowly letting me see him so I hope one day she will come to her senses one day too.
I'm more into your fast rap songs like shotta  flow but dam this shit hit just as hard
NLE Read This Bro...  “Can anything ever separate us from Christ’s love? Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have trouble or calamity, or are persecuted, or hungry, or destitute, or in danger, or threatened with death? “(As the Scriptures say, “For your sake we are killed every day; we are being slaughtered like sheep.”)“No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭8:35‬-37 NLT‬‬ 🙏🙏🙏
Started tearing up before the first lyric.
NLE Choppa plz keep your head up
I pray for nle Choppa so he can see his daughter
“Now repent of your sins and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped away.” ‭‭Acts of the Apostles‬ ‭3:19‬ ‭NLT‬‬ 💜🙏
Bro am not gonna lie, I feel your pain bro like on a different level, bro but all I can say is keep fighting for your daughter man I know you'll see her one day, and I'm gonna pray for that
This type of shit makes me not want children...Messing with a chic that want children and she still married, told me she seperated cant end up like fantasia!!!
2:35 “I can’t really call it pain, cause I KNOW this sh*t a process, God gives us challenges to see us make some progress.” Nuff said fr mannn... 🙌🙏
Salute!!!
3:09 “Tryna put me on child support...     *All the child need is support.”* Dang NLE. 🤦🏾‍♂️✊

This is a relatable story. I lost my daughter because my baby momma got pissed wanted a divorce and this is when she was first born. She took the child... my grandparents got ill, I got depressed. I was lonely. So have a good one chops, goodluck.
Nle is a literally a legendary father
Praying for you nle🙏 im sorry you have to go through this💔 i pray that everything gets better for you soon🙏🙏
bruh your daughter will grow loving that song fo shoo
I'm 16 with no kids this shit literally smacked me in the face and broke my heart 😭🙏
Ay man respect from Greece! Don't worry things will be better!👊🏻
Nle God got u
I love you bro
Shii just hits different when you was tha kid that had your parent kept from you
My man just dropping bangers after bangers my g
Went from rapping about guns to now a powerful message to the Fathers struggling to see they own Child Respect and hope you get to see Her
NLE just wants to be with his daughter, and genuinely wants to take care of her, respect and sending blessings and good energy 🙏🏻❤️
Now fans better hit us to 5 mill
This is what kind of power of women they can take your child
He should feel good
I'm in this same situation I ain't seen my son in 3 years 💯 stay strong nle shit get better after the storm 🙏
Handwriting is one point 🤣🤣 I’m jk this is a real one
really is the realest song he’s wrote.. this is another feeling
When ur daughter hear this will be proud of u💪🏼
He probably is a good father but she wouldn’t keep him from her if he didn’t do something, or maybe she’s just toxic and unforgiving lol
Everyday will be here vibin
I’m praying that you get to see your daughter. It’s messed up that you can’t get to see your child and you just want her to get to see and talk to you. When my dad went to jail I visited him and he called but he didn’t call me after a while and he new my mom number he just didn’t wanna talk to me. You are trying to see her and make sure she gets love from you too I’m praying you get to share your love with her❤️
He aint a child no more he a man now
Yo this that good shit
I'm praying she gets to see her great grandparents. That's something most people don't even get to do.❤️
Huge respect to you NLE CHOPPA for making such an amazingly inspiring heart touching song . Im not going through what your going through but prayer helps 💪💯🔥🔥support from SOUTH AFRICA
Nle this video touched my heart  hope everything  gets  better you a real one
Damn this song hit hard😥. You can literally feel his pain he's a good dad hope he gets to see his daughter  man: Wish I had a dad who cared about me.

Hearing this helps its lets me know that I'm not the only one going through it and your words inspire me and help restore some faith that things will get easier. NLE the true Voice thank you🙏
Hope everything turns out better chop this one of the toughest things anyone could go threw 💜

Just realized this was released on her birthday . prayers up for yall </3
"Mom be on somе complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat" You gotta show it ain't effecting you cause if you show that it hurts you she's going to keep Clover away from you.
Dang I cried for this song 👎cap
That boy kill it it be hard for me to it nigga kill it
She's going to take after your spiritual ways keep doing you chosen one💯🙏🏿💝🏁💪🏿
nle looks like  a good father and sorry nle about ur grandma
My girl has been going through this for 10 years now & her kids are now starting to see through all the lies and bullshit. Her deadbeat baby daddy has family in the court system, just saw the kids as a paycheck & turned them against her. Make sure you can coparent with a person before you slip up. I thank God I've never been through this.
I am in the same boat with my oldest son
he rly doesn’t miss🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I respect nle choppa for liking all the comments shows he appreciate us😇
I’m going through the same shit in life right now! This song lifted me and sorry to hear about your grandmother too she’s in heaven looking down at you with a proud smile on her face 🙌🏽
That was emotionally Hard man...
Real Shit Best song of 2021 No Cap🧢

This is tough Im sorry

i love this song!
This song grew on me
Damn NLE this is new level🔥🔥
This Is So Sad… :(
NLE, bro I feel sorry for u coz u got no kids and that made me cry. U will remember your daughter if u always think about her
This could be one of my favorite NLE Choppa's realest song, sheesh
i havent seen my dad in 3 months and im seeing him today and spending the weekent with him
#letNLEseeCLOVER
Yesssss we needed this !!
Nle gets a bit of hate sometimes He don’t deserve it He a king On top My favourite rapper  up there with polo G but choppa hits hard deep lyrics from a changed man🔥🔥
You need a parenting plan... set visits she can't say no too
Can’t stop listening to this 😢💔
If you listen to the lyrics you will understand his struggle G.O.A.T
Dis song hit sooo different I almost cried
Omg i love your videos and music I love you
I love this song 😍
Don't care at all 😭 cried that was real as hell. Hopefully all of the beautiful Queens understand that is a big powerful message within this song and that's don't use your kids as pawns or things to inflict pain on the father because at the end of the day it only affects the kids. Thank god he's a Lyricist and is able to put together a song that his kids can listen to in the future and understand otherwise the narrative would be written by the mom and we would have another 50 cent situations. Shout out to all the moms and dads but Mom's literally please put the kids safe stop doing things like saying you can't see your son or playing police games which will take your significant other what happens to be the kid's father away from them which once again only affects the kids. In closing I think women should go to jail for doing this s*** and it turns out to not be true.
Keep up the great work I’m sorry u went thru this
It was the saxophone before the beat dropped for me 🥰🥰🥰
it's been a minute since I've heard this much emotion in a rap song.

I can’t see anyone hate  on this song he just trying to see his kid And trying to be in her life
💙💙💙
We will fail every time; it is in our nature to SIN. It is only through the  BLOOD of JESUS CHRIST, that we can acquire complete forgiveness. We can all attain this by just accepting Jesus as our Savior, and accepting that He shed His BLOOD to atone for the sins of all who repent.   1. If you need help with ANYTHING in your life, all you need to do is ask God in JESUS name. I am not trying to preach here, but this REALLY works!   2. Just ask JESUS to FORGIVENESS of your sins!  And then say this BELOW.  3.  Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, The power, and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.  4. I am serious, this really works! Just say the LORDS PRAY Above, anytime you need HELP. It is that simple......

The same thing comin to you Chop 🙏🏽 you obviously love that girl more than anything or anyone, and baby mama obviously love money and not having to work for it more than anything or anyone. That “W” comin your way real real soon  bro💪🏽 🖤  Shouts out to all the dads in that same boat, out there fightin for your kids, and to the dads who already won that fight for your kids ✊🏽

Yb type beat
"Mom be on some complicated sh#$ so I don't see you. Never let life lessons break you. Evaluate the mistake and just wait for your breakthrough. I'm still praying for your momma. God gives us challenges to see us make some progress."  My son sent me this song because he's one of those father's who's just trying to be a father. As his mother & a grandmother, it brought tears to my eyes listening. We have not seen our baby in nearly 8 months because of her mother. Great grand parents getting older by the day. To Choppa, my son, and all the father's out there going through this, stay strong. NEVER give up! Your child is counting on you. God's got your back! All things come together for the good!
I felt it even though I don't have a daughter 👌💯

As hard as women are on “Deadbeat” fathers be hard on your friends and family members that keep their children from their father for selfish reasons wich happens more than 80% of the time women no matter how independent you think you are a child will ALWAYS need their father I pray all the fathers out there are eventually reunited with their young stay staunch my brothers 🔒❤️💪🏾💯🙏🏾

That just it facts... or not...   the fact of the matter is the song is really good # Trending
I love this song you are the realest rapper out here. 💜💜💜
I hate when women use they kids against they baby daddy😤. Its not like he can't take care of his own kid🤦🏾‍♀️
No pity for a G but I got tears in my eyes 😢 Praying for NLE, his baby girl 🍀 & BM 🙏 This is beautiful Chop - God's got you fr & WE got you too✌️💞
See this is how you now that daughter and father relationship are real Bc he made a rap about not seeing his  daughter and he put other father’s that can’t see there daughter to me I’m saying facts
I just love it’s no flexing, no guns, no gang shit, just him talking to his daughter 🔥
Someone show this video to his daughter
Aye it gets better keep fighting bro💯
When he came out with shotta flow  I never thought he would rap something like this,this is just too nice😔
Stay strong and stand tall like you do, inspiration to the people keep on the same path Choppa n nothing but good things will come
Blastin you here in Arkansas! Good luck man, I hope you get to see her one day!
"I'll cut my feet of just to see yo fist steps"😢💔
NLE is one of the best rappers out here

I’d cut my feet off to see yo first step

This almost made me cry 😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺 You should get to see your daughter respect G 🥺🥺🥺🔥🔥
NLEEEEEEEE HOPE UR DAUGHTER SEE THIS SHIT WHEN SHE GREW UP AND AS A FAN THIS IS THE REALIST AND MOST PAINFULL THING  ALSO   “I’m just trying to be a father” damn Nile
That grandma part got me fr
This is straight heat 🔥
😞
Isn’t that the same beat  from Outside
“never let life lessons break you, evaluate the mistake and just wait for your breakthrough” Word!!!!!!! 💜
God gives us challenges to see us make progress💪💯
Type of struggles money can't fix💔
Never let this song die
Choppa seem look like good dad
that just shows how much he miss/loves his daughter, he tattooed her on his leg, sends letters, and wrote a whole song for her… I respect that shit deadass, i wish you the best nle and that you get to see your daughter soon, i’ll be praying for you g 🙏
this shit deep fr
He got Rights, get a lawyer.
You can tell he put his heart into this one keep grinding it’s a path we all gotta follow but diffrent ways of following it keep your head up 💙💙💙
Eminem vibes
Yeah his baby mama dead wrong for not letting him see his child.. and having another person play daddy role sucks she probably don’t even remember her real dad cause her mom sick asf.
Hope everything get better for you bro 🙏🙏
Shit go hard but all Mariah want is the money

"all for you clover I turned over a new leaf, but I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat" this a factual bar right here mane🔥🔥💜
🐐
Lyrics:  I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever quote (You're so lazy) Yeah Letter to my daughter (Yeah, yeah) I'm just tryna be your father (Yeah) Ayy  In the back of the Rolls Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls Royce car seat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you growin' up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way (Ayy) I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from their toddlers Read books until you go to sleep Wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you

This is deep
He was usin his hear in dis song tho no klizzy
This is hard
I love youuuuuu Choppa , hope things get better for y’all 🥺💙💙
Love you choppa, this some real shit I been listening to you since you since you released shotta flow and ever since then I been listening to near enough every song you released, my favourite artist 💯, I’m only 15 coming up to 16 and of course I ain’t had to deal with the shit you talked about in this song but it makes you think as if your in the fathers shoes, you’ve gone from so many different styles of rap like the aggressive gang shit to the positive shit but this song feel like something else, you’ve evolved dramatically as an artist fr, you next up to be one of the greats at 18 years old, imagine your success and evolution in the next 10 years and yet still you’ll only be 28, some rappers don’t even come up till they 28, keep doing what you doing cause you doing the right thing fr, I hope to meet you in the near future, stay solid 🖤🖤🖤
Damn Choppa ts a different feeling 🔥💯
Bryson...Bryson)

I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever quote (You're so lazy) Yeah Letter to my daughter (Yeah, yeah) I'm just tryna be your father (Yeah) Ayy  In the back of the Rolls Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls Royce car seat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you growin' up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way (Ayy) I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answers 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers That's good fucking hearted but distant from their toddlers Read books until you go to sleep Wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you

Wow man he just wanted to see his grandmother happy with his daughter and that girl ain't let it happen
I'm sorry for my  niga
NLE is top 5 best hip hop artists that came out post-Uzi.
That's fucking sad 🥲
I don't have kids but this song here hit different af
I feel bad for ya man it must be hard just hold on one day when she understands how dumb her mom is she will come back even if she don’t you do your job as a father and show her all the love that you can  she WILL ONE DAY UNDERSTAND TRUST ME YOU WONT DIE BEFORE GOD GIVE YOU ALL THE FORTUNE YOU DESERVE
The reason i think that baby mama is trying to make money is cause the support and love from BOTH PARENTS is way more important than child support (FACTS). She digging for diamond but all she will get in the end is hate
It's amazing to me that NOBODY here understands where he got the concept for this song. Go listen to Don Trip "letter to my son". Trips a legendary Memphis rapper. That song will change your life.
braboo dms não tem jeito
don't worry God will present a chance to meet her again
Real talk
I know how it feels NLE no cap going through it with my two girls trying to be a co parent turned me into no parent that shit hit home fam
no pity for a G this song real heat its up there for me love you brother
The love u have for her is unconditional 😭😭. I'm sorry u had to go through this.
but man this aint even bout the music its about the daughter man u delivered.
Its the one I have no words i am just breath taken the transformation of a G named NLE now thats also a true story.
Bro this song had an amazing flow and an even better message. You’ll get your daughter bro it’s obvious you want to be with her they can’t keep you from her go get her 🙏🔥🔥
God bless you❤️👼👼🕊🙏🏾🙏🏾🕊👼❤️👼🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🕊👼❤️👼🙏🏾🙏🏾👼❤️❤️
My respect for nle🙏🏾
It's crazy cause I've only seen my dad a handful of times throughout my life (I'm 24) and the last time I seen em he was playing your music 😄 I hope he listens to this one and takes heed. Many props to you and praying for you.
Thank NLE choppa a lot people need real music like this to stay strong
LET THE MAN SEE HIS DAUGHTER
Choppa man 😭🤞🏾💙

*Let the lil homie see his daughter smh I'm 40 years old and I appreciate all the love when they tell me I'm a good father but I know better I lived my life I'm more tuned into the lil homies who's in their late teens or early 20's got all the opportunities to run the streets and do whatever but just wanna be fathers to their children salute lil homie I'm not a praying man but I hope you're bless with everything u want when it comes to your lil girl*

I normally don’t like NLE Choppa because of the music that he makes. About drugs and gang/gun violence. But, I have to say, I respect Choppa for this piece of art. It gave such a good message. I wish NLE Choppa could make more music like this and the Bryson Album but you know the industry and it’s bs. Salute to you Choppa. Amazing song.

You can really tell choppa really changed his ways and that he’s really pure!!🥺 I can’t wait for your situation to get solved and clover be wble to see you on a daily basis ❤️
We love you NLE
If your daughter means that much to you then you have an easy choice to make! Your daughter or the streets! How many people stayed in touch with you while you were in Jail? Family! You invited this child here, the least you can do it be a living example instead of your child hearing about how you were?
This is just a father talking to his daughter 💜
You can tell he really just wants to see his daughter
All he wants is to see his daughter
he should be able to see his daughter because he is a great father and i respect the hustle that parents have to go thru every day
Rip 🙏 to his grandma
"Based on a true story" jus makes everything hit harder .. 🔥🔥🔥 AS F×××
Bruh whoever disliked this you have no heart💔

I feel your pain man, Keep ya head up. I hope you get your daughter back. The shit you are going through is tough. It'll be worth it when you get to see your daughter though. Trust me.

Better not lower you standards, if he call you something else I bet I correct his grammar!! Being a father is tough but messing with the baby girl will get you some pressure
Bro we all felt this on another level💔 so much family bs separating fathers from they kids, and people are trynna say “dads ain’t never there” but they don’t know it’s basically impossible for a father to come around his kids without getting stepped on😞 stay strong bro💯💯
Let this man see his daughter
Nle man I felt this personaly man my dad ain’t been there most of all of my life but when I have kids I’m gonna be there for them for the rest of their lives I don’t want them to go through what i go through
Feel bad about your grandma fam. It hurts but I hope you'll get see your daughter some mo🤞

“Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world” How he said that bih was to hard💯
Nle tell ur baby mama about the song called forever and u guys will go back to normal
I Like this video we need more father like this to be in there kids life and lady’s if the kids father is trying to be in there life let him do it. Now if he was not trying to help you you will we be telling you girls he ain’t nothing but you have father out here trying to be in there kids life you are just not letting them
That don trip line hit different
❤️❤️❤️🇳🇬
“Turned over a new leaf, but I get the type treatment that belong to a deadbeat” 🌿💡🖤
This words are tough 🥺❤️stay strong
💜💜💜💜💜…I love this fucking song man💯‼️
real g stuff chop keep doing your shii i know it  might be hard but keep fighting you will get her back
There is a big difference from a dead beat father and one that is really trying but the mom won't let him just now from experience when your daughter grow up she is going to learn the truth outside of all her mothers lies and see you truly cared and was trying and the dude she got over there playing father will never be the father to that little girl cuz there is only a space your real father can feel and she'll know it
Man i wish choppa did more conscious Shit like this on god its so much more touching and good
At least he not like these other dads that don't even care about their child or kids😢, and don't even try to see them
NAILED IT: Long term relations with short term grief... DEEP...TRUTH
Reminder this dude is 18 speaking from the heart. Great song
Madting
Dope shit boyy
Alr someone tell me what happend
wait he being real?
Is sad cuz you ain't see yo daughter in a year-and-a-half
I wish u the most I ever could.  Respect 💯. 😢
🔥 🔥
Nle baby momma is just crazy I don’t get it
Let that main see his baby and rip granny choppa. Praying for granddaddy choppa
https://youtu.be/3krE0-hW7yI💥💥

Cuz listen this low-key touched a nigga cuz I got tears in my eyes
let baby choppa see her hops (NLE)
Damn bruh this touched me
SPECIAL SPECIAL SONG!
but i wish i couldve came to ur concerts but i dont have any money my dad is broke
FatherHood over Any Hood! 💯
:nle choppa. and i just wanna say im proud of u for making sure your daughter has the life you never had and make sure that she has money even thou u cant really see her and isnt starving and have a nice room and nice chlothes and really all im tryna say is ur the best father ive seen enen thou u an engraved crip and i wish i had a father like u
This one is personal to me. I feel it on a whole different level. .. My advice to choppa. Dont give up, move smart , dont give the judge a reason to keep you from your daughter. Keep all the reciepts if your buying your child anything. Plus your daughter gonna be old enough one day to realize and understand how it re all went down.
🔥
Nle choppa hard th
“Trynna be a co parent turned to a no parents feeling like a transparent” that hit a nerve
Shit sad bro

Man I'm not even a father and I cried damn man hope things go up from here👑
He jumped the game with this one ..... O lord he said everything that I want to say💯
I love this. I'm so glad you finally got to see your baby G. I hate a woman that won't allow the father of a child to see that baby if he's really tryna be a real dad. I would NEVER try and take my daughters father from her. She adores her daddy. Me and him haven't even been together for 5 years now and i still refuse to even get Child Support off him too. He is a tremendous father, and breaks his back for her and her happiness just as much as i do as her mommy, and i wish more women would be the same way for a father truly trying to be a dad..
Man big respects to nle he changed and made a fire song i felt that but its good I used to not respect him for making videos about guns and gangs violence even tho I grew up around that stuff I never liked it so big respect and if u make more songs like it ill listen to u I just subscribed
yessirrr
Good song I feel u bro
Annalee keep your head up because you know you're going through all that BS and tough times you keep fighting  for your dreams 💪
All respect for this 💯✊🏾
Nle chopper god bless you
Good
There's no way this boy 18
Man felt this💔💯
Shit real we fathers real go through this all the time when we just tryna spend time
I felt dis 🥺

Man that’s tough
Bro I feel l the pain😪

Love seeing artists grow
Bro this song fire is hell fuck  his baby mama she wrong  I fell nle choppa  keep grinding nle choppa  god blessed
Damn. NLE really went hard on this one
I relate to this so much but I’m not even a dad it’s my sister
Song is good but no shout out to Don Trip? Sure did use a couple of his lyrics from Letter To My Son
https://youtu.be/aTHxgYobfMA
If you cant send a letter, make a video.
This the realist song you ever wrote choppa 💯🔥🔥
I shed a tear listening to this but there is hope lil homie. I took my BM to court last year and won full custody of my two boys. It’s possible. Fight for it. U can win.
😓💔
Dis hit hard he never threatened  to hit his bm she lying bruh u shouldn't  keep him from seeing his chile bro my heart was broke bruh hearing  dis she gonna mess up da baby mine not seeing  da baby bruh she wrong dis hurt full
It’s messed up how he has to look at pic of his kid that’s just messed up and how he has to watch his daughters first steps on a phone it’s sad
This was not what i expected but it was real and raw. Hell yea
Don Trip would fuck with this.
its going to be alright nle u the realest
i pray i never gotta experience this, keep ya head up bro🔥
Thank you for this frfr I needed it 💯💙
Man I watched my dad live this and have to watch my brother and grow up not knowing our sister!! Respect 100 💯
Good song and great message at the end

Love to see it
I feel you but you gotta say strong much love for you
I just keep replaying this 💯🤦🏽‍♂️this song hit hard cause of the fact I’m facing these same problems
I like how he ain't one of those rappers that when they have a child they give up. Nle choppa actually care about his child. You are a good dad I am glad. When I was born my dad didn't care and he gave up. I am just glad you are doing good
This song is too cold and the lyrics are deep asf
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Fire 💗♾
Keep loving your daughter nle things will get better for you
This is what rap needs! More lyricism and stories
My ur grandma Rest In Peace 🙏🙏

“Let’s save more souls for Jesus Please post this message or a message of your own to other videos with hundreds of thousands or millions of views don’t mater what kind sports, cat videos just get the message out there” Please come to Lord Jesus before it’s too late! Judgement is any second now, All you have to do is admit with your mouth you are a sinner and need a savior. Believe in your heart Jesus is the son of God and shed his precious blood on the cross so that he may pay for your debt of sin, for he loves you so much that any whoever believe in him will not be damned to eternal hell but to have eternal life and joy in his kingdom. Which is by his grace alone that you receive this precious FREE gift and not of ANYTHING you can do or say to earn that free gift. That is all you have to do to be saved from his wrath which will fall upon the whole world in his righteousness judgement that will fully take place any moment now. Please except him into your heart my beloved brothers and sisters for you have great treasures and a inheritance beyond your imagination waiting for you because he loves more then you can ever experience here on earth, his heart breaks come home to your Father and your beloved family that will love you beyond measure, open your heart and he will give you all that you desire. love and peace be with you my beloved brethren God Bless you all!
I pray for you brother 🤦🏿‍♂️
This dude is talented frfr fuck a polo g he trash to me.Idk what everyone smoking on
I just wanted a child just to have something to live for 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro went from camelot to this🐐🐐💪💪
No guns, no flexing, just a father rapping off beat
Flight write this down
🔥😔😔🔥🔥🔥
this is hard
Had be some irking moms who ain’t like this track cause if your a Man shit hits soo deep
Imo his best
Ok
As a metalhead, there's only a few rappers that I don't mind listening to. Never heard of this guy, but as a father of 2 girls, this shit hit home. I can't imagine not seeing them everyday. Unfortunately, some of my friends have gone through this, and are still going through this. This is the kind of rap I like listening to, something real. The dude looks quite young, but the maturity in these lyrics make them hard not to listen to.  I really hope and pray you get to see your baby soon dude. I teared up listening to this, it feels so grounded and real.
shii hrd af
Bro men are always fucked by the court system

#savesheikhjarrah  #SaveSilwan  #SaveBeita  #savealquds

Some females can be harsh and vindictive individuals.  Stop using these children as leverage and to get revenge on the father.
You used don trips lyrics bra😂😂 “letter to my son” is the song you got em from
NLE Choppa will forever be GOATED
U did yo thing on this one choppa ☝️
Mad respect for nle to open even more on himself and his situation

Am really touched, no flexing its really a dad's word to a daughter, No cap
Keep going NLE dig deeper you've got so much you can do
Im a 33 year old man who has been thru this. Now i got custody.
demas
Like if nle choppa is the best rapper in the world 💯🌐
“Trying to put me on child support, all the child need is support” damnnn
What happened
Women need to stop using the kids against the father. Even if you can't be together the father has a right to see the child
this song is Beautiful and i feel your pain
The best song I ever heard,and its like im about to go through the same thing when I get a child
How can you dislike this
Damn mane I felt that shit 😔
He grew up W
Who else has this on repeat 🔥
I really felt that this might be your best song yet
Nle Choppa is one of the best n I hope everything works out in the future for u n your daughter💜💜
Say less.
I know he said "No pity for a G" but this whole song made me cry beginning to the end cause I know a couple of AWESOME black father's going through this same thing...I'm sorry granny never got to see your daughter before passing🌹, and I'm praying that the baby momma have a change of heart and allow you to see your baby on a regular 🙏🏿
This sound like a Rod Wave kind of beat
damn man this really hit me why does everyone have to punish people without anything that they did wrong thats just straight bullshit
This song is so beautiful. I lover the message. I hope this song get the award for “Song Of The Year”
This one of the most relatable songs ever💯
😪🤧
I hope you get your daughter back thuglife...I went through the same shit!! 🙏🙏
🥺
This the song of the year 🥺🥺 you can feel his love for his daughter thru this song 😭💞
The fact I knew this was coming. Fye tho🔥
Yall check out choppa mama live... she go into detail with proof that choppa ba b y mama lyin bout the whole thing bruh
touching but weird Fr Fr, her mother Is still somebody daughter so how would they feel towards this, you want yo daughter treated like a queen but not even communicating correctly with the other parent. Also why you try to change her name i thought it was clover....I’m just saying imagine if clover was Mariah and your daughter dealing with somebody like u.
R.I.p sorry for your loss hope things get better
Choppa rly can rap for real
Put this on Jpay for the homies in jail
brought tears to my eyes for i dont belive in taking the child from dad or mom its not the child fault and if you LOVE YOUR CHILD DONT TAKE AWAY THEIR FATHER NOR MOTHER
t the best strength
Mariah is so wrong ! You should never let your personal feelings for one another come in between a parent and their child . Grow up and do whats best for clover 🍀Mariah and let Bryson see his baby girl 👶 its really heartbreaking 💔 to watch you act like this towards him with yall baby  😔 RIP Gma Choppa 🕊
Sorry for ur loss NLE
Bruh I’m happy he saw his daughter 🔥❤️‍🩹
How you expect to not claim the baby and not pay nth nigga knew damn well
Wow this really hit home because I have been the daughter that has had to go through being separated from a good father because of my mother. I'm finally seeing him after 8 years from since i was 7 and now I am going to spend my first birthday with him since my mom made us move away from him. Being away from my father make me feel that I have lost the chances of learning many good values and overcoming insecurities.
Your daughter growing in the hands of another nigga (heart broken)
This shit touch me for real. you can feel his pain through his lyrics that shit sad. Keep yo head up NLE  we all love you
THIS SHII GOT ME IN MY FEELINGS 💯🥺💨💨
I gotta a lot of questions  I need to ask
No cap this song made me cry 🥺🥺 because like I really felt your pain your sadness in this song and you haven’t seen her for a year bro that’s crazy but don’t worry your fans 🔥✨are always here for you ✨🥺👑💪🏽
I felt dis on personal levels Real Life Story

I don’t even have kids and this song gave me chills
A moment of silence for the parents out here battling for their child everyday.... Just know y'all ain't alone ❤️
I love it I am sorry your grandma passed away. The song is 💥💥💥
GET NLE’s BABY BACK!!!
The lord and I are praying for you brother Es ist schwer, ein Kind zu verlieren und es nicht sehen zu können, aber ich wurde wütend auf die Frau, aber mir wurde klar, dass es nicht ihre Schuld ist und nicht deine Schuld, dass diese Welt nicht mehr dieselbe ist wie zuvor, aber der Herr verspricht dir, dass du wird es durchstehen und wir hoffen sie verzeiht dir Gott segne dich Bruder
this Durk flow but this decent
Man he should have the right to see his daughter. He a good father

This song has the same kind of style as another rapper’s song, everytime I hear this another song comes to mind but I just can’t seem to figure out which song and by who it was made   Need help, i feel like it’s Tory lanez or something, really not sure, just guessing    Any idea ?

Nle choppa é o mais bravo atualmente 🔥 tem como não
This hit hard...NLE Choppa definitely one of your best and Congrats bro is not easy being a Father especially when you deal with this type stuff... Hopefully you see my Comment...
To those in 2040 reading this, You had to be here.

The sad part is Choppa changed his life around, started gaining positivity and still can’t see his daughter even if he’s being talked down on. I wonder how choppa keeps positivity even after all the hate he gains. Keep goin chop 💜

I love It ❤️
💜💜💜💜💜💜

sad but true real fathers go threw this bs fighting to spend time with their kids while some of the deadbeats fight to keep the kids away🤦🏾, keep yo head up knowing it'll get better💯
who disliked wtf thats ine of the realest songs ive ever heard, keep your head up

[Intro] I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever quote (You're so lazy) Yeah Letter to my daughter (Yeah, yeah) I'm just tryna be your father (Yeah) Ayy  [Verse 1] In the back of the Rolls Royce, you can't enter with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls Royce car seat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group homе Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on somе complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me See you growing up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat   [Verse 2] Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way Ayy, I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me into a no-parent Feeling like I'm transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answer 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm trippin' Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  [Verse 3] I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress Ain't nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers that's good fucking hearted, but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep Wake up, cook you something to eat Mold you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryin' to put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  [Bridge] Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  [Outro] They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you
Lourddddddddddddd
You can’t really say much about this bc we don’t know what’s really happening but nevertheless I will always support you choppa  Much love 💙💙💙
This hits hard tho.
I felt this shit personally...
“I’ll cut my feet off just to see your first steps”This line got me in my feelings 🔥🔥😞💯

I’ve been a huge fan for a while about 1 or 2 years but I barely knew about this like I only got a glimpse if your still going through this I’m praying for you ❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾👩‍👧👨🏾‍🦱
Go be a father and get the chance that some father's don't get
"Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your break through " 🙏
I never see him
Bro this made me feel like when my friend moved house
bro said he was droppin sum real shii he did not lie
this song made me cry and Ian even a father I can just hear the pain in chop voice😞
This song hits different
Daughters deserve to be raised by a strong father, without a father figure in their lives they might be fed crap by their mothers and end up becoming single mothers just like their mothers and become bitter feminists bringing chaos to the society.
Bryson I hope you get to see ya daughter she shouldn’t do this to you because your a good father
I love this very beautiful
Keep fighting 4 your daughter god will help u through it ❤️❤️❤️
Really enjoy the song man. I’ll be praying for both you and your daughter!💯🔥
MARIYAH! Let that man see his child 🗣

Just keep praying and God will make it good
This made me cry. I wish I had a dad that cared about me. Even if he couldn’t be there for me, would be nice to know that he cared. I wish this family all the best
That happened to me
Hope you see your daughter 🙏
I have the exact video for this song bruh that's crazy poor nle
Be strong and keep believing I'll pray for you God have you 🙏 just believe
I hope his daughter hears this when she grows up 🙌
Y’all tryna pin the baby mama out to be the bad guy when he literally shot at her while she was pregnant and could of killed the baby but I guess that was just a mistake right?

@NotYourAverageFlight
NLE is a changed man he came from a rapper who talked bout shooting now he talking bout his daughter and turned spiritual a young successful man great job NLE 💜
NLE could be one of the best story teller in rap...
They keep the parents who are trying out the child life smh… Amazing song bro hope she come around soon
"I'll Cut My Feet Off Just To See Your First Steps" Damn...😢
bro i felt this not to me but someone Im close to it sucks bryson keeps getting better and better
The Best love your song bro 😇😇😇
NLE Choppa neva miss.
you can hear the pain on NLE's voice man  never felt this bad 💔😔
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This hurts so much to see that a grown woman would be so selfish and keep their daughter away from a man that wants to be there. That’s not only hurting Choppa it’s hurting the daughter AND it’s hurting Mariah but she too numb to feel it. That behavior is not normal.   Choppa- just keep trying. You were right about how God sometimes puts us through things, or tests us to be better and molding us into something we can’t even imagine. Keep fighting for your daughter. If I were you I would record everything, every encounter that way you can show your daughter one day (if she brainwashed and told her that you never tried). At least you will have proof if you need it. Keep persevering 🙌🏽 God bless!
Nah you snapped
This touch 😫
Hope you get a chance to see my grandma and my grandpa cause they getting kinda old and grandpa been getting sick
grammy
This comment is for his baby mama.   All Young girls get involved with these rappers and act like don't know what y'all getting into in the first place. 2, you should've thought about getting in the mix wit him first time y'all meet. 3, you know what you were doing wit this rapper and further more any man any woman can change if wanna change and if they are willing to change, it's called second chance at life any person can change for the better. So girl get wit the program and start letting him see his child and not least stop disrespecting his mama because told to TRUE your a mama your self calling someone else's mama B this And B that, how would you feel someone had call you out of your name. That's on Period #NoCap you girl get it together or your going to regret it and especially that lil girl. Period your a mother so act like it. I said what I said. I am someone else's mama to I don't let anybody call me out of my name. Period
man rly going thru sum
Give this man a raise
Now I don't like this guy but this song if fire for the first time someone wrote a song about father's not being there or can't because of the mother. Its about time time a song came out. Period #NLP
God please give this man dugter back
Fuck who dislike 😞
Respect🔥 definitely wasn’t an easy song to share with world!
🔥
I sure hope he sees his daughter more
this some heat but why the beat sound like a lil durk beat
Don Q vibes 💯
I wish u and ur daughter all the best
Im a 13 year old rapper and you really have inspired me alot. Also this song is a real masterpiece. Im proud of you ⚡
My respect for this man ↗️↗️↗️
This hits hard for me but harder for my dad because his baby mama won’t even let his daughter see him or me and my family. I hope all the fathers find a way to get their daughters back because this is a real thing
Nle has so much potential to be better with his word play. He has the right idea but, in my opinion, not delivered at his best. He may have tried his best, just hasn’t reached his absolute best yet. Definitely in my top 5 of mainstream rappers.
Realest Verses i have heard in a while!  Props to all the Real Dads out there 💯
The best in the game 🔥🔥🔥
I’m not even a father and this shit make me cry this shit touch my soul
Dang bro
Thank you for this 🙏🏽
33k comments wake up
It’s the systems that are biased towards men been through this myself Orange County is the worst for family matters especially towards men kind of hard when you want to be in your kids lives when the other person is irrational
bruh this not even music this art tbh
Love you nle 😭
This shit really made me cry
Bitter Baby Momma do the most!! She's  Beautiful
Damn how old is NLE? I thought he was a teenager.
This is deep, I hope she gets to see you more and she’ll remember you for sure!💫🔥

This shit deep
Song is  hard
Like that don trip bar please no putty fir a G
This shit hit hard praying for u bro 🙏
Ngl This Song almost made me Cry 😢
This caught me by surprise.  Being in my daughter's life fully,  and with my wife, this still strikes right at me.  Because so many things can go wrong while trying to do right...my heart goes out to you man, cuz the fire bars don't quench the waves of the depression crashing against your heart. Lost my grandmother too, so this hits different in many ways.  Stay up and stay blessed, Choppa.
'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin…. That verse almost made me cry
No entiendo lo que dices pero buen tema hermano 🙌
Damn bro 💔 I feel this on a personal level love you baby girl one day you find out what your moms about 👌🏽an I’ll be waiting with arms wide open KRE💙
Yo nle I know it’s the same thing came to me bro I know how u feel 😭😭😪🙏🙏

This hits home in a different way for me because of that. Whatever you do Don’t give up God will make it happen in time

Im heart broken 💔 to hear this NLE you will get to see your daughter grow up. Love ❤
Man this shit brought tears to my eyes I know exactly how u feel I feel everything u going through bro
This is giving me Eminem “Mockingbird” vibes when he is talking about his daughter, and also Eminem “Stan” vibes when he is writing the letter.  This is amazing ❤️❤️
This is from heart, and damn, it slaps.
Respect for you Choppa, I really appreciate how much you love your daughter and like you said this shit a process and you are going to go trough this bro
Another special one, rest in peace to your grandmother 🕊
This happens more often then you think, then the BM want to say that the father doesn't try just to get full custody because they are being petty because the father and bm didn't have a good relationship, which they don't understand when they do that it kills us, like ok yes we have a bad relationship but I ain't tryna have one w my child, I send prayers to everyone who may never get to see their kids, because when the bm Keeps them from us it makes us look bad, it's not an easy struggle to deal with all prayers to you choppa 💯💙
🔥🥶
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaw
What ever you’re going through i hope it gets better.❤️
I think you a great father I hope and I play you get too see you dater
Drake is a policeman too?
Man this is messed up no child should have to grow up with out both of there parents ladies stop putting these men that really want to be in their child’s life through this bro cause at the end of the day it’s gon hurt the child you are not helping them by keeping them alway from there father stop it ladies cause it’s actually men out here that wanna be there but y’all not allowing them to and it don’t make no sense man whatever y’all got going on let that shit go for the sake of the child stop being fucking selfish and think about that baby bro you don’t have to talk to him or have the bond ever with him but that shit is not cool keeping him away from their baby so stop it ladies please

Choppa I love u man your music just brightens my day every day
Am from the UK and it dosnt happen much but my friend dosnt have a dad and I showed this to him and he started crying cus he told me this is the exact same thing what happened  to his parents
I pray for you and ur daughter 🙏
Choppy this is hard ur a great dad

Damn man
Nle Choppa is trying to do right and Mariah is just against that or can't see that idk whats her problem and what she's doing is hurting the baby and could scar her when she's older but happy late birthday to Clover and also stay strong choppa you'll be able to see her more just pray
I really hope NLE and Mariah can work their situation out. Clover is absolutely gorgeous and she needs both her parents to be on the same page . Lord willing everything will be solved soon 🙏🏾💗
This song cuts deep! I don't know much about his situation but keep those prayers coming. Nothing is impossible with God. I'm praying for you too!
Realest song of 2021
Bro I’m in the UK and this song Is soo INSPIRATIONAL like u can understand the situation just from the song not from some Bullshit articles
THIS SONG REALLY HITS DIFFERENT. THIS ONE OF DEM SONGS THAT U REALLY HAVE TO THINK AND CHARISH. THIS SONG SHOWS THE FATHER'S THAT R TRYING THEIR BEST TO BE IN THEIR KID'S LIFE AND THEIR BABY MOM'S WON'T ALLOW IT BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DID. I UNDERSTAND THEY DON'T WANT NOTHING TO HAPPEN TO THEIR SON/DAUGHTER BUT THAT SHOULDN'T STOP THE PERSON FROM BEING IN THEIR KID'S LIFE.
My dad wasn't there for me and he want to be there for his daughter just  give him one more chance
Bro nle choopa baby mama please just get together please read this he love his daughter
Best father❤️
Let me just say a man could do the worst but when he gets a daughter he becomes the happiest man in the world and I mean that💯🤟🏽
Keep growing nle!!! Great song this one hit different its like we got to see another side of you in this song keep up man!
Real shit can’t help but respect it. 💯
I'm feeling so sorry for him when ever I see  the baby Mama it's makes me mad
wyld bre
so he didnt go to jail for robbery his Ex called the cops on him
His kid dead ??
Bro I felt this Nle stand out from the other artists much love bro
This song hits rip
damn dis made me cry sad he cant even see his own daughter NLE needs to see his daughter all da time *period
HE SAID"EVERYTIME I TRY TO DO RIGHT I GET PLAYED TO DA LEFT" BIG FACTS SOME FATHER'S OUT HERE ARE ACTUALLY TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR KID AND BE THERE IN THEIR KID'S LIFE AND THEIR BABY MOM'S WON'T ALLOW IT. WHILE U GOT A MAN HERE THAT'S TRYING TO BE IN THEIR KID'S LIFE AND WATCH THEM GROW UP. YEA HE'S DONE BAD THINGS BUT EVERYONE ISN'T PERFECT. SO FORGIVE HIM AND MOVE ON, DON'T HOLD GRUDGES. HE'LL DO RIGHT JUST GIVE HIM TIME.🎓💪🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Choppas best song so far telling a true story for so many fathers out there
Hard
This being a common thing angers the hell out of me. All I know is men that don't give two shits about their kids. To think that there are actually fathers that WANT their kids and are kept from them is simply unbelievable to me. Its sick. Some of you females need help.
I like how he ain't taking about that old life,Im glad he had a daughter he could of still been taking about murder and yeah
Keep your head up and your steps steady bruvah #soonerthanlater
Keep fighting , in life certain things come infront of our way because we still have a lot of unfinished lessons to learn , just don’t stop trying and stop allowing others opinions become who you are because anyone can say anything , it’s up to you if you want it to become your reality. Life is always a constant struggle just for us to see the pretty side , keep pushing Brodie
Choppa is a great father
Other rappers talking about there money and chains but choppa talking about his daughter
A father who wants to be in there child life
Just keep trying u gonna get to see yo daughter
Choppa is a good son, a good father, a good person, i love bro 💜
Straight fire stay real
keep ya head up and stay strong choppa 💜
This is fire,dont stop
He would sacrifice his life for his daughter
I can't wait to see the day when Choppa can see Clover grow up it seems like he really love her and not a dead beat dad
The beat 🏃‍♀️
Praying for you Choppa. Hope you get to see her more. Keep ya head high my g. Beat these cases and move on and live life. Everything will work out soon. Patience is key. And Rest in Paradise to your grandmother, death isn’t easy and I feel sorry that she could see your daughter before she passed. Stay real Choppa 🤞🏽🙏🏽
Choppa def the best rapper... him and polo definitely doing they thing
Happy Father’s Day chop
He back wit another banger
Let mans see his daughter 😭
Damn NLE u got me finna cry on this one and don't give up what u doin
What Mariah not gonna like Choppa gonna continue to support 💵 clover and that’s it going to be until then choppa finna wait until babygirl gonna be old enough to look for him and he will have open arms but Mariah gonna have to deal with the pain she gonna realize she can’t take away from clover cause she caused that pain and confusion in clover about her dad. Wait until choppa gets blessed with another angel and he gets to do what he couldn’t with clover and there is going to be all that hypocrisy against him all over again cause now you got a bitter baby momma mad at herself. She’s a great mom and I know they know deep down they can’t deny what they had and how they made that baby outta love at one point but she knows she’s doing wrong and it’s gonna backfire on her at the end of the day. Bryson if you see this I wanna pray for you right for you to let your worries and these cases and these distractions that are trying to get to you and these frustrations that you leave in the hands of the lord remember always he sends his toughest jobs to his toughest soldiers he will not put you in a situation out cannot handle. I pray that he gives your guidance and strength on this journey you are on not only finding yourself but letting him in more and more everyday and night to chose peace over hate and drama. In Jesus name Amen. TOP SHOTTA FINNA BE ALRIGHT!!! 👏🏼🙏🏼
Keep fighting I know how it is to not have a father in your life I wouldn’t wish that on anyone else
NLE i really hope whats going on gets better
This goes hard asf 🔥🔥🔥🔥
‘She tryna put me on child support” all the kid needs is support” sheshhhhh
You can tell its deep to choppa just thro the facial expression

My mom didnt let me see my dad for 4 years and this song hits so hard you can see choppa care so much about his kid.
Bro saludos desde Argentina ⚡🇦🇷
If a father really want to see his young one then it needs to be that way. The fact that he wants to be there should prove a lot. Son or daughter, they need their father because a real father is 1 in a million. Big ups G
Can I get a like choppa

I feel you bro my parents divorced and it feels the same way I cope with it by listening to ur music
Realest shit ever written 💯🔥
The only people who hit dislike on this song are the “mothers” putting their children’s father through this. Happened to me personally for almost three years, now I got my custody. Keep fighting for that princess, she needs her dad more than anything in today’s world.
I said what kind of parents are those Bowie so dogshit
I hate when black young man try to take care of his kids and the momma be a bitch but then wanna quick call them a dead beat or put them on child support I swear young females get it together your representation for us it horrible

Your girl was a h*e
🔥🔥🔥
The grandpa can’t even get to see his granddaughter, this is why so many people can’t even get to see there child for a month/ over a year. (I’m also surprised that she might be able to see her great grandparents
I felt this🔥🔥
it's actually pretty cool the NLE had Clover on Father's Day  last year so two of the happiest moments in the same day you got to love it
Thanks and shit get better hold it down… from one dad to another… respectful

Beautiful song
I'm about 1000 of the views this my fav song no doubt
yo choppa bro we all hope you get to see yo daughter soon man
Trynna be a Coparent Turn me to a No parent Now I'm feeling transparent What I'll tell your grandparents?  I felt that cuz I live this song in real life  All the way from TRINIDAD & TOBAGO 🍃🙏
The offbeat plantation broadly push because note proximally contain besides a godly crab. panicky, aspiring parent
i don't even have a daughter but i started crying
tf's with that girls eyebrows
She did you wrong bit I hope your you get custody
The only people who hit dislike on this song are the “mothers” putting their children’s father through this. Happened to me personally for almost three years to get everything back right with her mom, and now I see my little girl. Keep fighting for that princess, she needs her dad more than anything in today’s world.
If I was the kid I would not forgive my mom
Stop hating on Nle Fr
I feel so bad I hope you get to see your daughter always and Mariah is a bad gf  This vid is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
NLE CHOPPA is a real g man trying to see his daughter but the baby's mother don't want him to touch or see her bruh this shh sad but keep ya head up and keep grinding  NLE THE TOP CHOPPPAAAAAA!!
Wag 1 jboy
NLE reaching a whole other level right now.
Is it fake or what
If you disliked this video you messed up in the head
Sorry you can’t see your daughter
I cried listening to this. Hit different when its you
Father's Day is the worst day, other than their birthday, when you can't see your kid. Praying for you.
Nle easily the best artist, wish I could meet him
happy birthday!!!!!!!!!!
Chopper no matter what you just stay strong

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEN SHOTTA FLOW AND LETTER TO MY DAUGHTER (THAT SHIT HITS DIFF DIFF)
That's what we ask for, emotional songs with real lyrics, instead of a catchy beat and a couple silly words.
Yo nle choppy you really go hard this video is fire
1.4 k people grew up sheltered and never seen any lind of struggle. aint no fucking way yall disliked this song
Dope ass Song man..this is what one calls music not this gang banging bullshit..Good one NLechoppa...
On everything at least he acknowledge his daughter and not a dead beat
Thank you for this song NLE CHOPPA!! I been dealing with this for 8 years. You gave me more hope that one day me and my daughter will be together again.  There are so many similarities that i have with this song and it really touched my soul. Thank you

I remember as a kid him saying  ' I'd rather be on a harley trip with the boys' alot.   Today his been taking my twin brother and I out more and more.  My brother also rides now something mama never got to see see actually she only ever saw him on dirt bikes.    This song has so much meaning to me thank you so much💗💞💗     I hope your daughter thanks you for this song when she's older you deserve a hug from her one Father's day for this art!!! 💖

This nigga needa chill like bro there’s other artists trying to make a living bro🤦🏽‍♂️🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🐐🐐🐐🐐
❤️❤️❤️
I love this song! God please bring a solid understanding and a perfect solution to the the Fatherless and Motherless children around the world. We have to stay focused on the bigger picture. We get distracted fighting each other. However our children and their future can not be taken away. We have to train our minds to stop thinking how we were taught when the teaching is wrong.As a mother I just want to say that I’m not perfect. I have the ability to make some irrational decisions if anything is standing between me and my child BUT I don’t have to because we naturally as an American culture suggest that mothers are the more suitable parent. Fight for Gods way to prevail let nothing stand in the way! God bless this young black princess.I pray that an understanding between her parents become so strong and release her dominion and ALL the love she is entitled to have present in her life. In Jesus name amen. God is real everything else is a test, stay blessed. (Happy belated Father’s Day to ALL the fathers.Only God can judge.Don’t be a victim to your pride it’s a curse to the future. Don’t ignore spiritual warfare the devil wants you to feel like you can’t pray for the impossible when in reality that’s all we should be praying about.)
Damn near shed a tear watching this.
They did a good job picking the beat
Nle I'll be a rapper like u you a rapper that actually cares about the world
The important motorcycle excitingly reduce because opera perioperaively warn worth a rich pie. average, lyrical punishment

Respect to a real one  Love everything you drop 💯❤
This shit hit my heart hard bro 💔🥺 i hope the situation you in right now be over. Great song 🥺😭😭🖤
We need to do better
Not just a song also a story 🔥
He should be canceled talking like that about his babymomma he said he shot at her who supports this loser! Pick on someone your own size . a man who threatens or hits a women is a coward . It’s sad because a lot of young girls thinks it’s real cute until they end up in a coffin
It's enough to make a grown man cry
I respect
Ian gone lie ion fw bruh music like dat but dis hard asf 🔥🔥🔥🔥

A letter to his daughter yet still sounds like every rap song today. Can't believe people listen to this shit

Let's see how many subscribers I can get from this comment...
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  I would also encourage you to pray to the Lord Jesus and repent to Him for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus Christ or otherwise if you don't repent to Jesus for your sins and obey what He wants you to do with your life then when you die you will go to hell.

This is not a song, it's a justified court appeal.
Okay but what did he do?

“you nothing less than a goddess, you bet not lower your standards “

🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺✊✊✊👌👌👌👌
NLE is a hella god man even when if people don´t see it in his lyrics.
lil durk fan
Feel bad for you😭😢
The hardest and the most emotional song ever 💔
When he said”tryna put me on child support all a child need is support, would’ve gave you more than child support could afford” u know he loves his daughter regardless of his situation ✊🏽
Respect  ❤❤❤
Back again today. So fire 🔥
If girls make a remix to this im going to be pissed
Bsjg
He looks like that one pic of yb locked up on the thumbnail💀
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I hope she sees this song and sees how not being in your daughter's life effects you. Damn. You're 18, and you are fighting to be a better father than a lot of these 25 to 30-year-olds.
Lotta like Em Stan tbt
She is so cute
"Neva let them break yo spirit, in this physical world"
You grew some much bro I’m so proud!!! Positive energy much love
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
🔥🔥🔥
Damn, everything he said bout his grandparents is real, that shit gave me goosebumps
This the one 🗣🤞🏾.
Wow bro goog jobs
it's so unfair
God bless
The fact he can’t see her on Father’s Day hits hard!..... Nle has changed but I love it, don’t worry nle we will make sure you see her!  HE MUST SEE HER!
it really hurts when men are really trying or wanting to be there for their kids and they are not allowed to. The sad part is the same ones that be tryna be there for the kids get called deadbeats on social media. I pray everyone who has a kid never end up in this situation. 💘
I luv this song
Lmao she slapped the shit out u
My birthday past it was june 4
Brooo why dis shit hittin a nigga so hard!!!
He's got the money and resources to fight for rights to see his kid. Get it on paper and she can't keep her from him. Instead you make a sad dumb ass song about not seeing her
NLE CHOPPA is great at what he does hopefully that women sees what changed in him but we never know what happens behind the scenes he could still be on demon time he just need to go talk to his mom no cap she been his biggest supporter
anotha one 🙏🏾
Pray for that main choppa bruh🙏🏼
I feel pretty bad for you not seeing your daughter ❤️❤️❤️
Y he using don trip lyrics tho🤔🤔🤔🤔
So thats not his daughter?
3:02 just like yo Daddy, man idk why i just like this part
if you dislike this shi u prob was sent by his baby momma tf ya folks bugging
"God got us in the long run" fr man
I have no worse 😭😢☹️
😢😭😭😢
💜
Why it say brylie instead of CLOVER?
You can tell he lost inside he wants his daughter so bad like why would you wanna ruin that bond a dad and a daughter would have🥺🥺🥺
This really made me cry! Like as a mother of a little girl, how could you not let your child see they father?! Like that’s just really dumb!! Girls will always need they father trust me! How can you not let a man be there for his kids especially if he wants to be there! She should be happy to have someone like you because most young fathers don’t want to be in they daughters life…
Love u bryson stay strong 💜
He should have feat Rod wave on this
God has a plan for you. Keep pushing. God will make the right thing happen. Your daughter loves you
i Love This Beat
How are there still Dislikes????
I feel his pain man these moms just ain’t shit. I wasn’t there to see my first 2 born and missed out for 6 months because their mom wanted to put me leaving her (due to her cheating) in the way of me seeing my kids. He nailed it 🙏🏼🔥
This song and video is heavy af! All of the symbolism
Be honest, I think every NLE fan will agree with me that since he entered the game he has never failed to impress us with his music, he is able to create such meaningful and beautiful songs that mean something to him💯🙌
2:02 i was wearing headphones and when i hear the lyric my sound went to the left so i played the song back 5 secs then i heard him say "i get played to the left"    mad respect choppa.
Why cant he see his daughter?
damn nle choppa i pray for you
This his daughter in the video?
“I get the type of treatment that belongs to a deadbeat.” I felt that. NLE ain’t a “deadbeat” father, especially if he’s BEGGING to see and take care of his child, so why treat him like one? 
Them trumpets in the back tho😫
“I’d cut my feet of just to see your first steps” This cut deep 💯
Hi guysss, I just posted my own cover of heartbreak anniversary, could someone pls check it out or tell me how to improve? Sorry for the annoying promo, didn’t mean to annoy but I’m having great difficulty getting any exposure and idk what else to do🥺❤️ thank you did ur time❤️❤️❤️
Nba chop boy
💙
🙏🙏🙏🙏♥️
Why would anybody dislike this song🤦🏻‍♂️
That "fall slowly" beat in the back makes this hit different. It's good.
”tryna be co-parent, turned me to a no parent” damn.
Mirayiah if here this  can u please complete the wind 😔😣😖😫
Love too see the younger generation with that old mature soul and mentality 💯🚫🧢
This man just earned legend status
'♡'
wow
mannnn...
Banger👌🏾
Beat is kinda trash but this is hit diff
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 this shit sad asf
Those trumpets make the song 110%
I like this
People who gave dislikes should get beat up

“Tryin be a co parent turn me too a no parent feelin like a transparent what I tell yo grandparents”....!!!!! -Top shotta 💜🍇
Respect I feel u man ✊ 🔥
IMAGINE PEOPLE DISLIKING THIS SONG
This man earns nothing but respect finding ppl like him in this wrld is rare he's been through so much I felt when he said I'll cut my feet off just to see yo first steps it's been rough but keep it up choppa you've Been a real one since day one you never stopped grinding since shotta flow I feel like ur so underrated and deserves more cuz how much u been through and when u said seeing u get older scares me allot and thinking I might not hear ur first words hurts me to death and she might be calling him daddy . I felt that all personally but just know God has better things waiting for u if u keep the grind up
nle choppa changed real good from a aggressive to calm and just holy well done
Это прекрасно
No matter what you say, when a man wants to be with his daughter, how can you possibly deny that? Fucking evil
This dude went from😈to😇to😈to😇 in one year
ǝıp oʇ ǝʌɹǝsǝp sɹǝɓɓıN

I was in a hurry I open YouTube and I see the cover of your song and reading the title I focused on daughter so even if in a hurry I opened the song and heard it at the end.Even if your grandmother is gone, it is as if she was always there close to your daughter and you.

I ain’t the biggest fan but I’d really listen to this more Fr, this heartfelt man that’s what I like, not gangbangin and who u gonna kill, just the things you’ll  live for and won’t live with
NLE is my little brother's age & looks just like him, it still trips me up
🔥from Italy
Bro this is the most deepest music video like this man is putting bars up top of bars man respect
A good decent song he made
This one was deep bro, I’m a teen but this is similar to the feeling you get as a little kid when you don’t see your parents for a while
Nle my guy this is so sad i wish for you one moment in your life too see your daughter for as long as you want
Its all ways the good getting the worst....😔
How can you be so mean I mean she didn’t let your grandmother see her own granddaughter and I bet Iraq’s her dream
NLE your music is fire and everybody knows it, and I really understand, hope your daughter grows up to be like her awesome dad🙏🔥
NLE Just A Spiritual Person Changed His Ways And Still Making Fire Songs And They Are All True

From hearing his first songs this nigga truly grown
This young man is a true poet. Damn near brought a tear to my eye
❤️
All the dislikes are deadbeat "parents" just hating because that's all they can do good.
This is nle's best shit.every bodey say nowadays rappers are lazzy and say nothing with meaning but they wrong
This helps me when I barley see my son and pay so much child support the system is corrupted to fathers
We love U NLE!
Tune yuppa
I’m sorry for u
Let’s goo man 💅🏾
No matter how big you get feelings are a thing and my boy chop expressing dem 🌟
Women get mad when the father aint in the child life but when wont let the father in the child life

nle hope you sort things out with mariah ❤️ .  your daughter will remember you she will one day look at this video And kno you really tryin yo best for her keep it up big man 💘
man i hope you get your baby all love
Most niggas running away from their kid but NLE wants to be the best father he can be and take care of his daughter this shit heartbreaking dawg
This shit hard as fuck I relate 100 bro from Australia 🇦🇺 I have a daughter I barely Get to see
So proud of him for trying to do right by his daughter.  Ladies please let's do better. Keeping a child from their father is only hurting the child. Money or no money a child don't care about material things, just love and emotional support.  Allowing my son bond with his dad was the best decision I ever made. I love how we co parent. Let the hurt go and focus on these babies! Trust me, your child will love you for it!
If u dislike dis then u obviously don't care about ya kids or give af to understand the lyrics 🙅🏿‍♂️🧢💯💯💯
Happy late fathers day NLE. You finna see your daughter.
GUYS DONT WATCH THIS, ITS FAKE NLE CHOPPA, I HAVE PROOF, ill tell proof at 1000 likes
Did she die.
This song is fireee
This song is terrible
it sounds like he sampled logic song 1-800
He is spiking truth and no Bullshits
"God is real. God loves you. God wants the best for you. Believe that. I do."  Chris Pratt
this shit hits in so many different ways, i have 2 girls i havent seen in 3 years 😠😡🤬😖😢😭
It's crazy that NLE has to make a song to try to see his daughter. I also wish that the cops understood this better for people in these situations.
Man dis one of Dem Vibes right here ....dis wud of been extra fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥 with Rod Wave or DaBaby or Lil Baby no capp 🙅🏿‍♂️🧢💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Realest Nigga For Diss💯💙
Nle is a young G.O.A.T in my eyes
BRYSON sure is real AF..shows we are all human..you can feel this...NLE..A Real DAD that wants to be there for her💜
" Never put my hands on dat women wasn't raised that way "  🔥💯
This song is so cute 😍
Who remembers NLE from the "NOLOVE ANTHEM' song?
8o8
Respect ✊
"ik I got a daughter I barely get to see" damn that's cold
I just cried bc I can’t see my LIL sis
Love it my nigga
King trell
That is so sad well he gave you season daughter
my most favorite nle choppa song
Rip your grandma
Before you wanted to be copying a young boy, now you want to copy him rondo, you couldn't put another title on him, you didn't have to go out writing letters like rondo did.😬🙄🖕🏽
This hard💯 you snapped
It's absolutely heartbreaking this young man was not able to bond with his baby the 1st year of her life. He should have requested that she not be allowed to be around anyone that the mother is dating. I'm on the baby's side. Continue to allow your music to be your therapy.
#letnleseehischild
I love the part where he talks act his grandparents
I think I missed a few episodes in the No Love Entertainment Chronicles.
Nle won’t heart this
My son told me to watch this video and it hit me deep it touch my heart to see a father who loves his daughter so much...I'm not sure wat happened between the mother and him but I wish them both the best and hope they realizes wat matters the most which is there little girl and that she will be the one that's hurting in the end of all.God bless you both and your Angel.I pray that everything works out.
Stay safe chop 💜💜💜

Nle just a loving father who’s made some mistakes in the past. It’s sad that he can’t see his daughter because he clearly loves her and would do anything to spend time and protect her. I don’t believe that did anything to the mother out of rage but what ever the court decides we have to accept
NLE with a shirt?

Hardest song you wrote so far. Hope things get better
I'm really mad at her momma right now. She took away his daughter and heart for what?!?!? He might not have always been there but he'd give his life to see his daughter grow up.
this song should have way more views he clearly put his whole heart into this he's a goat 💜💜💜🐐🐐🐐💛💛
this gotta be the realist shit you ever wrote much respect for u ✊🏾🔥
Damnnnnn that’s the realest shit I heard in awhile big ups to Choppaa!!!!  Let’s go!!!!!!!
BALLER
Is there no way to petition for him to get custody or anything? This man deserves to be able to take care of his daughter.
Please no pity for a g, tho I got a son that I barely get to see, I see him for a hour after that he gotta leave ~ don trip
This fye
Nle choppa I feel what u saying Mariah let him see brylie cause what if she grow up and neva see her daddy  it's ok fight for brylie Mariah say y dissed her and her dude but it ain't a diss it's a Father's Day song nle the goat 🐐🐐

He took Maya Angelou’s idea and ripped it up, shat on it, threw up on it, and then decided to upload it to YouTube

🔥🔥

Love This Song 💜, Straight 🔥,  Reminds Me Of Me and My Father Relationship. I Like That You Remixed; Letter To My Son By Don Trip  For All Of The Girl Dads 👩🏾‍❤️‍💋‍👨🏾. #StayBlessed🙏🏾
he turned fathers day into "My Daughters Day"
This shit hit right in the heart
the 1.3k dislikes prolly his BM and her whole family
Damn this make me miss my dad I haven’t seen since I was 7
It’s crazy because it’s happening to people everywhere all because of greed
Luv that he changing up but I hope he ain't running out of his own lyrics song a bit to close to don trip letter to my son
I know I’m late but happy Father’s Day papa choppa (pause)
I would he as hurt as him couldn't feel the pain of not being able to see your child.
Hi bryson
You finna be king von type story teller bro keep going
"Fighting 2 felonys bout you and I got another Case" that tells you how much he really want to see his daughter before its 2 late.
Wow this hits different. Such a vivid picture from a true artist. 🎨🙏
sorry ass baby momma ain't let the gma see the baby smh
😭😭😭
Im proud.
His baby mama on the bull
HOW SOMEONE CAN DISLIKE THIS 💜💜💜💜💜
sucks for us good fathers !
Can we just appreciate how much work choppa been putin in lately? 🔥
The fact I get to see my daughter I can’t take it for granted I’m praying for you
GET DIS TO 3M
He put his all into this song. 🔥🔥
This is so fyeeee
He said I cut my own feet off just to see her walk like that 1
My respect for you 🔝
Just remember that NLE Choppa ain’t even be able to drink yet
Sorry choppa
This hit me hard choppa keep your spirits up god and Jesus are behind you
I feel bad for u man 😢😭
Awww ☺️ I’m so glad we get to see his daughter
This even got the non parents feeling some type of way😔🖤
As a social worker this song is so beautiful but breaks my heart because I wish fathers knew what rights they have. But because the system is so fucked up especially for our ppl a lot of black men refuse to go to court for custody. You’d be surprise how many men are getting more and more custody of their children. Free advice for anyone dealing with this situation; IF THERE NOTHING IN WRITING SAYING YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE YOUR CHILD, LEGALLY THE MOTHER CANNOT KEEP THAT CHILD FROM YOU. Even if there’s a restraining order from the mother, if the child is not on that restraining order as well then it doesn’t pertain to them and in that case you can use a 3rd party to exchange the child without the parents seeing each other. You’re welcome!!!
everyone share this song to your mom ur dad your daughter anyone that you cant see the often good shit chop love you man
my man choppa is going through the same thing as flight is.
Bro imma show this song to my dad by my two youngest sibling we don’t get to see and there mom won’t let us talk to them and i feel like there slowly forgetting us
"Tryna put me on Child support all the Child need is support🔥🔥🔥😪😪😪😪😪😪"
Keep your head up King 👑. Hope everything goes better
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Real music
This song better get its love it deserves.
I bet she disliked the song
Love it ! You can feel the energy!
Choppa got all my respect ❤️
needa separate my pride from my feeling. Damn on sum real shi 🔥
God give us problem to see us progress, Theirs no such thing as loss in life it’s opportunity to grow that’s gods way to lead his children cause nothing comes without sacrifice just not worth it without it?
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)
Good luck nle
🤌
That's sad
I thought this was a good video, but that part were he taught his daughter how to load an AK-47 was a little overboard.

Damn🥺I cried tbh
Shit made me want to throw up
I low key cried  💎 .
At least you have a kid my ex got an abortion without telling me  like she was telling me she gon keep it but decided to get rid of our baby😞
Its sad when having a baby is a two person thing, but one completely takes over
NLE you can’t be using sage it lets demons in your house
This song just hit my heart. Man has changed throughout the year this song just warms my heart. This song remind me of me and dad how i don’t see him that often.
I actually shed a tear to a rap song..congratulations I have much new found respect🙏.
Big respects, powerful song❤️🗣
Damn this song beautiful af man keep your head up bro and do what you got to do I hate bitter ass baby mommas
Damn Choppa grandma looked good asf for her age. Doesn't look a day over 40. RIP to his grandma.
They could've co parent and she could've got more money for her and the kid if they co parented that wouldve been smarter  hope things get better choppa
Ni&&@ called you something (probably a B word) but corrected his grammar...  Just the degree of respect he puts in it got me in tears.
Lets take a moment to listen to this god of rap
This generally made me sad
cant you pay for a crazy good lawyer?
Now Choppa the G.OA.T

"Please no pity for a G😭🔥"

#HARD YOU SPIT YO HEART N SOUL ON THIS REAL SPILL💯💯🖤
Keep head up high 🐐
I support him I hope everything works out with him and his daughter🤞🏽🔥🖤 they are twins🙉
Gives me yb vibes
Let this man see his daughter, he's trying to beat this statistics that men aren't there for their children. And he's trying to be a good father and be their for his daughter. Despite the relationship, Mariah can't hold this man from his child. He's trying. Praying for you young king 🙏🏽
Sounds like death enclaimed mixed with valuable pain
Keep pushing King🙏🏾  There is a light to every tunnel 🎯💜
Nle good song
🤯how much someone can go through at any age
This hits different. My daughter melted my cold heart and allowed me to feel warmth again. I hope you get access to daughter soon. Keep fighting bro, your message reached thousands of hearts! Song fire 🔥
True goat just want his kid

Man Choppa I feel you, ik the struggles is real. Stay strong man, and I hope and pray that you see your daughter. You deserve to be in her life man.
This hit different nle choppa deserve better hope things chamge
Why do girls think they everything we boys do sum shit to ‼️‼️
The scene where the coo got him out the house with no shirt is crazy bc in the police footage of he tells the cop he bought that house for his BM.
Yo this is Inspirational and Teen parents are the most hard working a deserved people in the whole wide world and because he made this song proves that being a teen parent isn’t hard it’s just takes a lot of responsibilities
NLE choppa turned a new leaf Nle u the one I look up to u like my brother but i pray that u see yo daughter
Some RP truth here. It’s crazy the courts have given all of the power to the mothers and allowing them to break apart the household.
I love this song  Also this isn’t about his current situation right he gets to see his daughter? Is it just like fir speaking out about the people who don’t get to see their kids Edit: I’m sorry NLE sending prayers 🙏🏾
Rip grandma choppa
His handwriting sucks
I pray for you and your R.I.P your grandmother
“I get the type of treatment that belongs to a deadbeat.” I felt that. NLE ain’t a “deadbeat” father, especially if he’s BEGGING to see and take care of his child, so why treat him like one? 😔💜
This one cut deep! I’m praying the mama put all the bs aside and let him see his daughter. He’s trying and she making it hard for him. And it’s crazy how females like that would be the same ones to turn around and tell the kid they daddy wasn’t there to help and she had to do it on her own when it don’t even have to be that way smh. All prayers to you and your family Bryson & R.I.P Mama Potts.
Let's go nle 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man keep your head up you deserve better
I can stop listenin to it 🥺💕.
It’s real💯🔥
keep yo head up man you gonna be able to see her it’s gonna get better

ik someone singing in the background of the song it kinda sounds like Tory to me , they should make a song together
Mane give choppa his daughter back mane smh
Wow that’s all I can say🔥 rip to his grandma man😞
I mean if the mom got a problem with him but okay but their kids don’t have a problem that is no reason to keep the baby away from a dad that wants to be in the child’s li fr cause a lot of fathers don’t wanna be in the child loge so she should be lucky the father wants to because if he didn’t she would want him to want to be
shout out don trip for the original letter to my son! hope he gettin some royalties lol
nle don't you ever give up on yourself or on your child always keep your head up remember god always have your back hope you have a good rest of your day.

NLE CHOPPA WAS MY FAVORITE RAPPER TO NOW AND TO scene
Nle just tryna be father
I just became a listener after hearing this instant classic
Mariah's whole plan was to get with Choppa, have a kid, than break up so she can get some of that child support
she tryna get that child support money
2 million views in one day ? Yea NLE up there fasho
Nle is one of the hottest rapper out now 🐐keep it up
Sorry to hear about this, lil homie. I've got a 10 year old daughter I don't really get to see. I can count on both hands the times I've gotten to see her. Wish you the best luck with this situation. Shit sucks.
Bro when he pulled up on bro and didnt pull a gun I respect him way more
Real Artist Shit NLE 🔥
And the fact that NLE got locked up for trying to see his daughter like these cops ain’t here to protect the people more like break them

I love this 🥺🥰
Realist shit I’ve heard from this nigga so far! Niggaz that been through or going through all drama wit they BM just so they can be in their child’s life feel this song! Keep it up G!
Choppa, if you see this, just know life has a way of correcting the things we feel we cannot change. God continually fights our battles, so know you're good. This world 🌍 is filled with little girls, especially, who wished they could see their fathers one more time, much less have one fight as hard for them as you fight for your daughter. Keep fighting young King, I promise you in the end it's all worth it. And this song will forever be a reminder to your child of how much you love and adore her. Also condolences, I'm so sorry your great grandmother didn't get to meet your legacy. The mother of your child has to get older and when she actually grows up there's a lot of things she'll be apologizing to you and your daughter for. Blessings to you and Clover, happy belated father's day.
puta madre🔥🇦🇷
Ayoo my boy choppa you need to watch who you make baby’s with not to be rude and she lied and said that you hit her I know you not like that and I’m so sorry 😢 that you went through that and sometimes girls think that we don’t go through any thing bye king 👑 👋🏽🥲

Not going to hate, but honestly never liked his style. Been stuck on that playboi carti underground style for a few years or even lil peep. But respect for the song:
Wow this shi go hard hope u see yo daughter and wen yall get older yall can  see this and show how much u went through to see her
Choppa this touched my soul bro I'm proud of u from cordova when we first met u matured so much I would've never pictured u to be this way but I'm proud and glad for u this and bryson really touches my soul to see u make it out of ts gave me hope and inspiration to leave the streets and all that bs behind and start a new path. THANK YOUU CHOPPA!!

Speaking from the heart
God got u choppa-  I had a 6 year relationship out of it i had a boy- mom did the exact same thing.  It wasnt a couple weeks.  We talkin years.  Drug me through the courts.  Of course i pay child support- but nothing compared to what i woulda done for the boy. Fathers play a vital role -
damn nigga, life may be hard fo him but he still keep it 100. Props to you man, hope your daughter would grow up and love you and not listen to her mama bout everything she gon say about you to make her hate you.  💙💙💙 💙💙💙 💙💙💙

let him see his daughter
The amount of people that don't realize that so many men go thru this because the woman they thought they loved turned out to be for the streets.. Its so sad that courts almost always rule in favor of the mother. Children are not pawns to be used against hard working Men who just wanna do right by their Kids.. BABY MAMAS LISTEN UP!!! JUST BECAUSE YOU HATE THE MAN WHO SEEDED UR CHILDREN, DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD KEEP HIM FROM HIS KIDS.. no one ever said u have to have a relationship with him, But your children definitely deserve to have the right too!!!!
I’m so sorry this happened to you💔This is so sad and it shows that you really care.I hope things get better because this hit😭
Choppa deservese to see her

This so is so sad 😭  I feel so sorry that your going through that with your daughter. NLE deserves way better and everyone know that. Don't worry and keep your head up

Never knew I was outcasted while circling this bitch (world). Momma passed no father or kids. Another holiday I celebrate peoples glory even tho, have no ties with me. No way to relate my story, but still your smile gets me strong when I start feeling weak. New Places to visit I barely got to see, since I put a distance recently to all that opposed me. Was ready to leave but this frequency got me where I need to be.
Get your own little child please get your child you miss all you need to get it this song is good for the father who don't have the child
❤️
words in this is special fr choppa a goat. 💯🤞🏽
This hit different😪🔥🔥
I couldn't see my oldest daughter her first 7 years of life....now she is 14 years I was 19 when she was born....I definitely know this pain all to well....still hurt me to this day she still not with me and she barely calls me I will forever be hurt by this.
NLE go hard but definitely a shout out to Don Trip for the original - Letter to my son

Dam this Shii hurts me💔💔💔😞😞😞😖😖😖
Don’t ever apologize for speaking on how you feel, the song is real emotion, so don’t feel bad for speaking your truth, at the end of the day it’s for your daughter and no one else… Nobody is perfect and everybody makes mistakes, but you love your baby and you’re doing what you have to do now to correct your steps so you can be a better man and a better father for her… Just keep pushing and things will fall into place, God knows your heart and your intentions and sees everything, in the end the enemy doesn’t win, just continue on your journey, stay in faith and remember why you doin it 💜
I love when you make songs with messages like this, it shows even in this generation we got artists capable of saying real shit 💜
“I would cut my own feet of to see you’re first steps”
Mann this hits hardd all love to people that struggle like that !!
Lmao nigga copied quando rondo 🤡😂

Keep fighting man it's rough but lie everything there is a light at the end of the tunnel..... it's just going to be a little bumpier than usual. My prayers go out to you and your family. No father should be treated like this even with there mistakes. It's good to see that you're a changed man and still drop hits. The struggle isn't over yet, but it will before you know it. Amen. <3

This song makes me sad
Damn this is deep, but great song brother. Hope it works out for you!
I've seen my ex go through this, such a great father only for his kids mom to make it so hard for him to see his babies if she don't get her way,it cause major issues in our relationship as well,I just wish it was more help for fathers who endure so much as you both ,more protection for the fathers so the kids aren't used cause either the bm can't move on or just a piece of shit period .So to all those who go through this i pray GOD make a way or get these laws changed so this won't be such a thing any more,if she love her kids or kid like she say she does they won't use them as weapon thats so weak...Respect to you young man
Good to see a youngin with his my more right then these ol heads 💯💪

"god give us challenges just to see us make some progress" -NLE Choppa
This song make me cry
The way he came for her lashes thoooo  Hot heads make heated split second decisions then see the consequences and want the same peace they had the opportunity to have from the start but to hotheaded hardheaded and stubborn to consider everyone involved if you can’t respect the person that risked their life to bring the baby in the world how can expect it in return but people gone do what they gone do I’m just observing
i love him so much i hope he gets to have a relationship with his daughter it hurts cause me and my dad are close

I love how real this is though! FIRE either way
Look just gotta keep praying you gon be able to see her soon she loves you just know that yo baby momma being immature but don’t worry she miss you and you’ll be able to see her soon
You learned so much and your only 18 btw nice merch lol
I can't stand when chicks deny the baby's father to see THEIR child(ren), that'll make the child resent you. Chicks like that will lie and say that the father was never there,  ever came around to see the baby and have the damn nerve to lie to social services that they don't know who the father is because they purposely didn't tell the man the baby was born. The child is the one that pays for the mother's bitter shit.
That's sad the girl should let him see his daughter she's more his daughter then hers
Dat bihh mariah throwed off frfr 🤯
I hope he gets to see her more 🙏🏿
💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪
Bro have a happy life
Damn.

Happy Father's day I see you was in ya feelings
We all support him
Jesus died for our sins, and lived the life we couldn’t. He died on the cross for our sins and rose 3 days later. Anyone who acknowledges that they are a sinner, declares with their mouth that “Jesus is Lord”, and believes in their heart that God raised Him from the dead, will be saved. Repent & Live for Him, He loves you and He is coming soon 😁💕.
Ayo let chopa see his daughter this shit don't make sense let him see his daughter u fell me

The fact that I can’t even see my dad bc he’s dead an all this man wants to do is take care of daughter and be here for her❤️ an the mom don’t give to fucks💔  Edit-y’all PAINT  NLE  to be a bad guy bc y’all believe what anybody els say
Respect to NLE he is a real one for that and his child
" ill cut my feet off just to see your first steps " damn
Listened to this too many times
All he was trying to do is see his daughter then got arrested that’s wrong that’s how the world is sometimes 😔
The best type of man is the man that would risk everything for their child.

The crazy part is these guys got millions of dollars fully capable of taking of 100 children and the state still sides with the momma and half the time the momma be pieces of shits who don't do shit for they kids. Too worried bout social media likes and follows.
the story of the song was better than the song itself honestly NLE has been humble as heck
NLE CHOPPA IS GRADUALLY STARTING TO GAIN THE SAME LOVE X HAD🙂Y'ALL GON SEE WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT LATER🙏
I cried on this , cause it's so related to what I'm doing through , we good father's but the mother won't give us a opportunity

Let nle choppa see his daughter im keeping it real
https://youtu.be/JJZ5iFUN1I4
Fathers day hits different when you got no dad😢😢😢
i love this person, the heart is so big
Insane fr keep going off
There are so many fathers and even mothers who are dealing with the same thing. Seems like you are trying to make your mistakes right and change as a man. I pray everything gets better and you can see your daughter more. A lot of times parents (who keep their child away from the other parent) don’t realize that kids are affected by not having a relationship with their mother or father.
God Bless everybody reading this God Loves y’all🙌🏽✝️❤️🙏🏽 God Bless you and your Family and make sure to give Glory to Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and put your Trust, Faith, and Love into him and believe Jesus Christ is Lord and is the Son of Our Most High God🙌🏽❤️
:,(
Respect
Keep fighting man it's rough but lie everything there is a light at the end of the tunnel..... it's just going to be a little bumpier than usual. My prayers go out to you and your family. No father should be treated like this even with there mistakes. It's good to see that you're a changed man and still drop hits. The struggle isn't over yet, but it will before you know it. Amen.
sorry for the lost of grandma ❤️
Reminds me of Don Trip-Letter to my son💯
You a real one on god bless u
Man u rlly got me in my feelings gang god bless u fam and hope u get to see your daughter more often 🙏 ❤ 🔥🔥🔥🤟🏿🤟🏿😭😭💯💯

I have respect for Nile choppy and I am so sorry he have to go tho this that is messed up because I just hope and pray 🙏🏽 that he just get to see his daughter because his parents probably want to see her too I am so sorry he have to go thought this I am so sorry now choppy 🥺😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
that hit diffrent.
this is the real choppa
If u disliked this video ur going to hell
U thought u were polo g
Such a great song brodie, I don’t understand the position of being a parent and not present but I definitely understand being a kid and confused while learning about my adoption and her being sheltered away from her birth father who wants to make a change in life for him and her, that right there let alone will mess up her mind. I understand babymama thinking you’re trying to get all attention away from her first birthday but the message of this song was way deeper. NLE, you just want to be called father/dad/daddy by your little girl and make this day special to you. It’s M town all the way right here brodie 💪🏼 keep that head held high and keep proving to us, the fans and community that you deserve these moments and God will be there to pay back all these times with bigger smiles and no problems. All love from here brodie
This hit different I am a 10 year old girl and my parents are divorced and this is how my dad is feeling (edit) and I also look up to you so much NLE
Been a fan, but this one made me cry. Praying for you, man.🙏🏻

When having a child or children have a genuine love respectful relationship so the child or children won’t suffer. Also if the parent wants to be present and doing what they suppose then don’t stop the child or children blessing .
That’s Why I Love Pain Songs

You make sure you move right for your daughter.👌
Bro 🤯 amazing love it ❤️
I'm a Mother with my own son's . I'm sorry for all the pain your going through . I had brother that couldn't see his children. I had a son that the woman told lies on him . The good father's have it bad . I say to you hold on you believe in God . Everything will work out for you . Thank you for the song it really touch me . I pray that many more father would step up. The same with some father's that won't let the child see the mother . In the end the children are the ones that get hurt . I'm a strong woman because of the things I went though. I took care of my son's by myself. He have chosen not to be in there life.  He miss out on a lot . All of them are on the road to blessings . All Graduated from High school or college. God made them strong . They didn't give up because there dad was not there.  It just made them strong and wiser. I'm a proud Mother of young Black Men . No I didn't stop their father from seeing them . He just choose not to .  Live the same city and still do until this day . Keep your head up and continue to stand young man . You know your worth . Don't let no one make change out of you . Meaning Your the whole 💰 not coin's.
Let this man have his kid
Tryna put me on child support When really the child need support Proud of u 💙
this song was fire bro keep it up
What you have baby ???
I said this shit might be the realest shit I’ve ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that [?]) [?] (You’re so lazy) Yeah Letter to my daughter (Yeah, yeah) I’m just tryna be your father (Yeah) Ayy  In the back of the Rolls Royce you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls Royce car seat for my new born Baby girl, you’re blessed because I know some kids who grew poor Ain’t seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit, so I don’t see you Shе put me on the police, at thе end of the day it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you clover, I turnt over a new leaf But I get the type that belong to a deadbeat Know the God in the universe be workin’ for me Seeing your grow up from a far tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I’m still prayin’ for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma ’cause they’re getting kinda old And grandpa been getting sick So Mariah if you hear this, can you please complete the win? Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see it It’s hasn’t been a couple hours, it’s been since the first week And lately I’ve losing sleep, it’s been hard for me to eat Last time I went to see you, went to jail on that same day Fighting two felonies ’bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on a woman, wasn’t raise that way All I wanted a child just to have somethin’ to live for Now I’m dyin’ just to see you, somethin’ that I’d kill for Tryna be a cold parent turned me to a no parent Feeling like I’m transparent what I told your grandparents I’d cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn’t in town to see your first breath Might not hear your first words and it’s hurtin’ me to death Every time I try to do right I get played to the left

Listen to Daughter Cry by Barz A Mania on #SoundCloud https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl/gZo3V
I never put my hands on a women , I wasn’t raised that way💯✊🏽
Nle be going hard since lately
This song really made me 😢.I lost my father at a young age.I can remember all the times we shared together we were like glue.Just to think some mothers and fathers cant share those moments.😭No one promised tomorrow becareful how you hold kids for ransom.Every child deserve to spend time with a unharmful parent that wants to be there.
⛈🥺❤❤❤
e        eeeeee
never give up bro
Keep it Brodie this a banger
NLE for life ❤
Wow I have never heard of this guy before I listened to this song, some real shit man. God is always watching brother. Matthew 24:12Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved. 14And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.

Is this yb
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that you need Jesus as your savior, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
Wow. This is a great ass song i think a lot off men can relate to your problem these hoes always be trippin and then be whining your not there for the kid, the only thing a real man wants is to be there for hid kid so fuck all the hoes that be like that. Love to al my G’s going true this fucked up time
Respect Poland ♥️
Ion even listen to him like that but this song on sum rs💯
why was she so mad this obviously ain’t a diss girl tripping
Fire
Dam dat boy lyrical asf🔥
Hell yea my boi
[Intro] I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever quote (You’re so lazy) Yeah Letter to my daughter (Yeah, yeah) I’m just tryna be your father (Yeah) Ayy  [Verse 1] In the back of the Rolls Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls Royce car seat for my newborn Baby girl, you’re blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain’t seen you sincе the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicatеd shit so I don’t see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin’ for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I’m still prayin’ for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma ‘Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick     So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?     [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven’t been a couple hours, it’s been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it’s been hard for me to eat  [Verse 2] Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin’ two felonies ’bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn’t raised that way (Ayy) I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I’m dyin’, just to see you, something that I’d kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me into a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I’d cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn’t in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it’s hurtin’ me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You’re nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin’ else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answer ‘Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I’m trippin’ If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I’m tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings     [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven’t been a couple hours, it’s been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it’s been hard for me to eat  [Verse 3] I can’t really call it pain ’cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn’t even hit a reset, learn something life ain’t teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin’ smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers that’s good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep Wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, ’cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I’m praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would’ve gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that’s in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world ‘Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls     [Bridge] Letter to my daughter I’m just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven’t been a couple hours, it’s been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it’s been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven’t been a couple hours, it’s been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it’s been hard for me to eat  [Outro] They say Black fathers don’t matter, they say Black fathers don’t care But more than anything, I’ll always be there I love you

Literally just cried in my car some people just don’t understand.!!!! 🙏🏾
I ain’t no father but seeing a father fighting for their child is a man cuz other father don’t gaf abt their kids but A real man would do anything just to be with their kid, like my bro he has a daughter but the mother don’t want him to see the daughter and he thinks that when the girl gets older the mother gonna tell her “ your father abandoned us “ when reality he just wants to hug and be there for his daughter I don’t know how it is to have a kid but I would love my kids to death and fight for them no matter the same thing NLE is doing.🙏
🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯
Thanks for this Bro 🔌🔌🔌
If you dislike the video your going to hell choppa doesn’t deserve what’s happening to him
This is a inspiration fr Choppa
I lost my dad so she should listen
Who is from Russia?
Damn this song deep🙏🏽
This is dope tho
😢 I like it that’s why I want to be a rapper
Love the delivery ❤️
🥰🥰
Bro Going Threw It He Dropped This On Fathers Day Ion Know What Ill Do If My Kids Where Taken From Me RESPECT BRO‼️
hard 🔥🔥🔥
This man is a lengend all my respects for nle bro this song feels with another vibe
This is a something that a lot of men especially black men are suffering from, props to nle for shining light on this. So many bitter single mothers make it near impossible for the father to see their child, and it doesn’t help that the courts and the law  are usually biased towards the mother. This is something America needs to fix. A lot of these men aren’t deadbeats they are victims of exploitive, manipulative and bitter baby mommas.
This goes hard prayers!!❤️
To NLE choppa u are my fav rapper keep up your hard work those bars  are just 🔥🔥🔥 keep it up 😀😃😄
This was beautiful, very sad story you had to tell bro, hope everything does work in you and everyone around favor❤️❤️
He rapped his heart out, pure flames🔥🔥
We love you NLE
danng MARIAH let him see his daughter more ‼‼
hit different fr🤧

Damn bro you aint do shit, you just wanna see yo daughter. Don't give up NLE, We all believe in you
Let NLE CHOPPA see his daughter it's time now !! Share repost make this go #trending
I have a good friend who’s daughter was taken from him before she was born. Her mom moved across the country and makes it impossible for them to even FaceTime let alone see her. Praying for better situations for all fathers going through this. I hope you find peace.
anyone hear his voice pan to the left when he said left at 1:56
Let this man see his daughter
I just hope he gets to see his daughter more often or try to go to court pretty soon🙏🏾
I swear to god NLE is just getting better and better every time
wait u till she can understand this it will change her whole POV of her mom
😕
Dislikes are from the fools that don't understand how hard fatherhood is
I know that sometimes God put all of us in front of hard decisions and situations but we have to stay strong because all of this shit will pass. So you have to stay strong and face this shit and don’t let anyone to ruin your best life 💜💜
🤧😢❤️❤️❤️💌
i was a monster, lost everything, the most precious being my children. Years later im still looking for the day they come back in my life... good song though
Going thru every word u speakin bruh that’s crazy you really not the only one going thru shi
And I hope you see your Daughter
It sounds like hit em up rondo letter to ai but nle it still go hard
Y’all need to realize that he threatened the mother of his child and said some terrible things to her and what she had to go through during there relationship, he may be changed man but he still treated her wrong and I hope he changed enough to see his baby❤️
Please God protect the soul of NLE, he is so talented.

NLE is king
I will pray for you
Nle the top shot
I feel you youngen I'm wid ya
This shit deep
Whats crazy is i only been around my daughter 3 times since she was born in October. Didn't get to see the birth name not on the birth certificate don't even have my last name i was in a slump depressed. Just not understanding some that was planned and wanted to do and be the best father at one point i was so hurt i was trying to convince my self im not gone ever see her i might as well detach my self spiritually but i couldn't i bugged her mama blowing her up every day just to see that smile on my daughter face the thing is i have no hate nor ill-will towards my baby mom's but her side of the family manipulate her thinking and get us into it about what they had conversation my daughter have not me no one on my side my grandma always asking about her and it's sad a 67 year old woman who take care of her whole family got health issues have to drive from Kansas city mo. To san Antonio Texas to see her and this same lady let my baby mama stay at her house when i was trying to get us a spot to the women with kids and want kid. Your life is to that child and just like the men our feelings dont mean nun when it comes to that son or daughter u have do better be better love and peace🤘🏽🤞
I’m going through the same thing
Prayers for NLE and everyone going thru this.You will get thru it.🙏
We with u NLE❤️
Hope everything works out bro
Let him see his daughter bro your time coming soon I promise
I thot he was died
#forgiveCHOPPA🙏 stay up king
Amen to that  this song and the message at the end too🙏🏽👏🏽👍🏽💪🏽

NLE doesn't understand how many life's he's helping by his job
That’s Real Nie💯🗣
❤️
Was she able to read or to understand the letter? 🤔
nba youngboy vibz
Sincero demais!!!
this kills me bro.
No man should have to fight anyone to see his own kid. Any woman that prevents a man from seeing his child should go to prison.

Love this... Has Don Trip heard this song? He did letter to my son
Lol🥺
[Intro] I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever quote (You’re so lazy) Yeah Letter to my daughter (Yeah, yeah) I’m just tryna be your father (Yeah) Ayy  [Verse 1] In the back of the Rolls Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls Royce car seat for my newborn Baby girl, you’re blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain’t seen you sincе the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicatеd shit so I don’t see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin’ for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I’m still prayin’ for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma ‘Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven’t been a couple hours, it’s been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it’s been hard for me to eat  [Verse 2] Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin’ two felonies ’bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn’t raised that way (Ayy) I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I’m dyin’, just to see you, something that I’d kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me into a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I’d cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn’t in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it’s hurtin’ me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You’re nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin’ else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answer ‘Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I’m trippin’ If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I’m tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven’t been a couple hours, it’s been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it’s been hard for me to eat  [Verse 3] I can’t really call it pain ’cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn’t even hit a reset, learn something life ain’t teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin’ smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers that’s good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep Wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, ’cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I’m praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would’ve gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that’s in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world ‘Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  [Bridge] Letter to my daughter I’m just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven’t been a couple hours, it’s been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it’s been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven’t been a couple hours, it’s been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it’s been hard for me to eat  [Outro] They say Black fathers don’t matter, they say Black fathers don’t care But more than anything, I’ll always be there I love you
🔥🔥🔥🔥

LET THE MAN SEE HIS DAUGHTER!😢
It's hard for you to eat because you and Summer Walker got the same diet.

What we are experiencing now is just the 'compost' of the previous 'age'. The good seeds of our Future are sprouting inside of our minds right now! But some who hold power over us want to distract us from ourselves! and our Planet.
Choppa needs a Grammy for this. God damn.. 💔
So sad. But Nle keep it up ur almost there to my fav
*YOU CAN CHANGE THE WORLD* BE THE CHANGE YOU WISH TO SEE IN THE WORLD. THE ONLY WAY TO HEAL THE WORLD IS TO HEAL YOURSELF. BUDDHIST PHILOSOPHY/MEDITATION .. LOVING YOURSELF AND KNOWING YOUR TRUE WORTH IS THE ONLY WAY THROUGH!! TIME TO FREE YOURSELF FROM THE CHAINS
This song made me smile😄
Yo man keep this up I can see you changed and your music is getting better as well

i watched the live stream and now i understand the lyrics on this song
人谁不动心呢？尤其是面临功名富贵时，如何能不动心？孟子这里说“四十不动心”，这是个主题，人怎么做到不动心呢？人啊，天天随时随地在动心，怎么个动心呢？《中庸》里面就提到“喜、怒、哀、乐”，这是孟子的老师子思把人的心理状况归纳成这四种情绪。后来演变成中国文化里常提到的“七情六欲”。六欲是汉朝以后佛学传人的思想，是说人对色、声、香、味、触、法的需求。七情呢？是我们固有的文化，出自《礼记》，除了“喜、怒、哀、乐”之外，又加上“爱、恶、欲”。不管七情也好，八情也好，不去管它如何分类了，我们每天对事情没有不动心的。人真修养到“不动心”啊，就是“内圣”境界，不但对功名富贵不动心，—切都不动心。那么，你会说，不动心不就是死人一样，不就是呆了吗？所以我们要讨论不动心。  其次，由不动心引出来公孙丑的一段话，他说：老师，你的不动心，有这样高的修养工夫啊！秦国当年在秦武王时代有个勇士叫孟贲的，你比他还要厉害啊！  从公孙丑这句问话我们发现，这位学生到底不行，公孙丑竟然拿武功来比孟子的不动心。武功里有没有不动心呢？有。现在我们觉得很有意思，方才也提到过，打拳啊、练武啊，叫国术。中国过去不用这个名称，什么“国术”、“同技”的，是民国初年以来受西方文化影响才改用的名称。古代对于文章写得好、武功练得好，称文艺、武艺，意思是好到了艺术的境界。我们看古代的书，说“武艺高强”，不说“武功高强”，更没有说“武术高强”的。虽说只是用字的不同，但用字涉及一个国家文化思想的背景。所以武功到了最高处，同文学一样，进入了艺术的境界。过去的武艺也的确先要修养到不动心。——《孟子与公孙丑》

Choppa done told y'all n*ggas that he got step in with sum heat this year.💯
Man i never expected to cry from an nle choppa song but here we are. Prayers to you and everyone else who has struggles like this. I promise everything will get better 💜
I’m so confused on why he is complaining about child support? Like just go to the court systems and fight for your child. Problem solved did he need to make a whole song?
I really cried and screamed inside of me😭😭😭🥺 jus wait and be patience, some day, she will see u and when she gets older, she will say. My pops made a song about me.
man this is one of the reasons NLE choppa is my fav rapper he is a changed man and he is just so sweet also send prayers to NLE choppa and ur doing amazing NLE choppa
Idk his backstory. Why can’t he file for custody?

Yo, now I done seen a lotta deadbeat baby daddies who could give two fucks about they daughter but it’s a breath of fresh air to see a baby daddy who actually wants to make the real effort to see his little girl! I hope she can learn that it’s bigger than the past and that a girl would love to be around her dad. I know you’ll get the chance!

THE MARATHON CONTINUES 🏁
lyrics  [Intro] I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever quote (You're so lazy) Yeah Letter to my daughter (Yeah, yeah) I'm just tryna be your father (Yeah) Ayy  [Verse 1] In the back of the Rolls Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls Royce car seat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you sincе the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicatеd shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat [Verse 2] Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way (Ayy) I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me into a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answer 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat [Verse 3] I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers that's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep Wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  [Bridge] Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  [Outro] They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you
im happy to see that bryson cares about his daughter and his fans. choppa is a very talent and creative artist happy fatters day bryson Lashun.

this song puts tears in my eyes
Mollly still trippin.
We really we need to talk about this shit its crazy that one our biggest stereotypes is running from our children but when a black father tried to be in their life the mother didn't want them not because of them thinking of there daughter but themselves cause they are either jealous or still butthurt its disgusting.
“ all for u clover I turned over a new leaf” wtf original bars asf only the real music listeners got that🤝💯
I’m glad that you got to still see her
So much respect for this perfect family🙌 NLE FOR LIFE
happy fathers day

I love to see fathers wanting responsibility for their child. Respect to you nle. Happy fathers day 🙏🏼
I hope you are doing well and that you stay safe and keep your head up happy father's day keep fighting for your baby girl
Dude u big inspiration
1mil in 12 hrs ?
John 3:16-18  Jesus loves you, and died for our sins.  Jesus is coming back very soon to judge this world and set up his kingdom that will reign forever and ever. Hell is real, hell wasn't made for humans but for fallen angels but if you reject Jesus and his sacrifice you will end up in hell. Repent before it is too late. Please i plead with you for the sake of God THERE IS NO PROMISE OF TOMORROW, REPENT REPENT REPENT.  .
The fact that he can't see her is heartbreaking </3 but the fact there are dads out there that leave their kids and don't even think abt it twice and how he's fighting for his speaks volumes (especially for his age) . I hope he can see her soon
Nle u changed a alot u can make us happy or sad or u can make us vibe your flow it's diff but i love u and stay safe yall

Happy Fathers day ya'll 💖
Mi único problema con NLE Choppa es que no tiene otro estilo bien pudo utilizar esta letra y un estilo más relajado con su bidones en algunas partes pero lo hace como otras canciones y pues le quita un poco de frescura
This song fire it remind me of what my father had to go though with my mom😔it was sad cause I got sent to faster care for 3 years and when I finally got out I didn’t get to see my mom or dad now I’m messed up😔😔🥺🥺
Keep going bro I pray for you bro
Hey man I can relate a little bit because since I was 8 or 9 in 2018 I was separated from my dad he was in Huston and I was in Washington state across the us but now he is on his death bed if you have a discord account can you add me to tell you the rest because I have been listening to you're music since the beginning of 2020 because my dad had severe heart cancer and it has been getting worse by the days so you're music has been a way to get away from reality.
Rip to your granny

Much love brudda🌎💯💜💙hardest shii realist shiii🔥🔥
this  song has been on repeat
Best music I heard in a long time (NOTHING BUT RESPECT FOR THIS MAN)
Please no pitty for a g. Woman. He’s trying to see his kid on Father’s Day. Some kids don’t have dads and can’t say that so quit ripping it away from the ones who can because it takes a true person to respect someone who puts him through so much bullshit. NLE you set brotha get you kid and focus on your own
Mariah need to know that it take 2 ppl to make a baby and she need to stop acting selfish and rude and let this man see him baby. Not just for a couple min or hours but as long as a dad should see they kids. Choppa have changed for the best to become a better father and she still NOT letting him see his own child. Hopefully she realizes how selfish dumb and rude she being and let the father of her child see his daughter. Ik this whole situation none of my business but it make me pissed tf off and it make me sad af Love you choppa...keep yo head up...😥💜
My respect for NLE really went up from this, and Happy Father's day man. Keep fighting for your kid ✊
I love this song ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Real music will last forever, keep ya head up G
Prayers too NLE❤️

Ain gon lie this to hard
May God bless you Choppa

NLE CHOPPA FIRE!
Respect
This honestly makes me sick. I would of done anything to have my oldest son’s dad, involved in his life. He hasn’t seen my son since the day he was born, now he’s about to be 15 this year...it’s sick to know that there’s dads would there who are being kicked to the curb because of a bitter baby momma. That’s what she is. She can’t get past her own feelings, so she’s making the child suffer & using that baby as collateral damage. I promise, she will resent her mom when she’s older & finds out her dad wanted to be in her life.
Choppa gotta be one of the youngest goats in the rap game
“Even though shit got rough, I’m still praying for yo mama..... hoping that one day you’ll see my grandpa and my grandma”
A let this man see he's little girl
Bout damn time🥵

Love this song I just feel as if nigga running wit top flow and I’m not feeling🤷🏾‍♂️

1:20 I thought he was getting off beat for a sec not that it matters
Damn nle was hella poetical in this. NLE been dropping banger after banger 🔥🔥💯
ik this supposed to be fr but nle you know how to write my boy?
Choppa  the only rapper that likes comments 🐐❤️
I feel bad for him but then I have to remember why he can’t be around his daughter. Smh
💜💜💜💜💜💜
This song was so deep and the vid seemed like an actual movie, this is a humble side to NLE choppa.
NLE still being my favorite rapper, I hope I don't gotta go through the shit he goes through
It going  to suck for her future bf
Thank you for this song. I’m goin they the same thing right now with my son. Every word hit to the core. Succs to have something that’s apart of you taken from you with no good reason then you’re made out to be the bad guy at the end of the day because the baby doesn’t know you’re truth only what they’re told. Respect my nigga I hope shit gets better for you real soon you deserve to see her n she deserves to see you.
Choppp og
I will make EVERY video idea I get in the comments on this video: https://youtu.be/52-ylN8Ojik
NLE Choppa, man hope you get to see your daughter soon and also you shouldn’t be kept away from your child, Let me list reasons 1. You helped make your daughter 2. Spending time with family is quality time 3. Children need a father, especially that because guys just be going around getting girls pregnant and don’t want any responsibility of taking care of a kid, and karma hits them
Happy father’s day chop
Love you bro ,brother hood fusho keep yah head up💜
And dey say some girls are jus evil🤷‍♂️
The music video was very creative of NLE  adding his parents,grandparents and him talking about his child shows he cares,want to be in his child life. I never seen my artists that I like talk about there child. Its like all they care about is money.  I feel as his baby mama want the child all to herself. If  it was the other way around. she would of be mad if she can't see her child as well. They should have some type of a agreement of co parenting. But NLE is not going to give up. He going to keep on fighting. Also in the song you can feel and understand. I don't blame NLE at all he have a right to feel how he feel? Happy father's day.
God bless you and your family Bryson 🙏🏿
Stay strong and always know God will make a way💪🏾❤️
I hope you get to see your kid again
Some  Eminem vibes
respect for me
Sory

Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen

The Livestream explained a lot! I'm glad NLE took the time out of his day to "clear his name" even though us, his real fans should already know he ain't even that typa person. He's a father now and he just wants to be there for his seed as he should. Life's a roller coaster so hold on tight baby!!! Don't ever give up! THE MARATHON CONTINUES NO MATTER WHAT
Just finished watching your live stream foe... just wanted to say to NLE CHOPPA dont give up and everything will eventually come to light and everyone will see what it actaully is. Big ups to you  bro... this song is everything and happy birthday to Clover 💜💜💜

and i hope you get to see your daughter soon again and not just because mariah knew you were releasing this song and playing it smart. she didn’t even do this out the kindness of her heart, she did this for herself so people don’t come attack her after they heard the song today and that’s just cruel.....putting herself before you and her child.  what kind of mother is she

I done heard stories like this too many times someone’s gotta stand up for the fathers of the world because they honestly don’t get the respect they deserve. I just love how the court always sides with the mom no matter what and gives her full custody because “MEN ARE ABUSIVE AND PRIVILEGED.”
damn bro, what a song, best of luck to you ps. song was a banger as always
Happy Father’s Day you’ll get thru this🙏🏾
I’d cut my feet off to see your first steps- nle choppa

" Letter To My Daughter "     NLE Choppa  [Intro] I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever quote (You're so lazy) Yeah Letter to my daughter (Yeah, yeah) I'm just tryna be your father (Yeah) Ayy  [Verse 1] In the back of the Rolls Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls Royce car seat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you sincе the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicatеd shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat   [Verse 2] Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way (Ayy) I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me into a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answer 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  [Verse 3] I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers that's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep Wake up, cook you something to eat Mould you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more than child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  [Bridge] Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  [Outro] They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you
Keep going I’m from Tennessee too!! Keep repping
Nle hey idk if you will read my comment but I feel you bro keep your head up and keep fighting for her and your songs push me to do better everyday thank you for showing us this story and you will make a good dad
Long time relations with short time greed
nle choppa never miss . 🥇💜

🙏🏾❤
Happy Father’s Day bro
❣
Came from the live! Let’s get to 2 mil in 24 hours!
NLE never disappoints
900k in 7 hours
NLE'S MESSAGE IN THIS SONG IS SO IMPORTANT FOR THOSE FATHERS STRUGGLIN, I WILL ALWAYS RESPECT U NO MATTER WHAT U DO🙏🏽🐐  I STARTED LISTENING UR MUSIC 2 YEARS AGO AND U ARE A PERSON WHO HAS HAD A LOT OF INFLUENCE ON ME.
Take care of your love and have your best life with your daughter. Wish you the best.
I have no respect for mellisa or whatever her name is the baby momma, she put her feelings before her daughter’s life. Clover deserves to have her biological dad in her life especially if he’s willing to be in it. There’s dads that don’t care & just leave their children & nle that wants to be a father to his own daughter is rejected out of her life. It’s better to put your childish past choices aside (both of them) & do what’s best for clover. He just deserves to see her & care for her, regardless of what happened between nle & the mom.
My dad has to go through that this shit touched me
Song
Let this men see his daughter 🙏🏾

Italy Choppa I love all y'all song Wheat Belly I love the shadow flow chart for 243 Shuffle 405-5467
Tough
reminds me of maine musik
Let me guess, his girlfriend broke up with him who gave birth to a baby girl, and since they are not married yet and due to some difficulties in @nlechoppa ‘s recent life it has been extremely hard to see his daughter that he loves and maybe that’s why he made this song.
That’s
And it’s Father’s Day
Damn..
I think she’ll get the message
This is sad, my nigga Bryson can’t even see his daughter on Father’s Day what type of shit is that. If Bryson can’t see his daughter on any other day at least let him see his daughter on Father’s Day 💔… KEEP PRAYING Bryson 🙏
Man nle thats my nigga

Beat sounds like that Joyner Lucas song Fall Slowly. Same chord progression, drums come in and out the same. Weird.
Baby moma fuckin drama 😤
I feel his pain pry for him💔💔💔💔

People like his baby mama piss me off he actually wanna be in his daughters life and u preventing that it’s daughters that can’t don’t even know they daddy or didn’t get the chance to say goodbye to they pops what ever drama y’all got going on shouldn’t affect his relationship with his child period let that man see his daughter stop being childish wake up this world fucked up he need to be in her life 💯
dis sum real shit
Just all love. This just proves he ain’t one of these narcissistic ass rappers. I love how he realises it’s family over everything. Most men aren’t great fathers so this heartwarming to see

Happy father day nle
NLE CHOPPA 🤧🙏🏽 THIS IS SOME REAL MUSIC
This fire keep.it.up
[Intro] I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever quote (You're so lazy) Yeah Letter to my daughter (Yeah, yeah) I'm just tryna be your father (Yeah) Ayy  [Verse 1] In the back of the Rolls Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls Royce car seat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you since the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicated shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat [Verse 2] Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way (Ayy) I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answer 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  [Outro] They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you

NLE Choppa has came a long way. He’s such a changed man in a lot of different unique ways. He’s even been meditating n all tht. God has changed him in a spiritual way. Always b in ur daughters life. The visitation energy needs to b a 50/50. Keep yuh head high nd let god take it from there. But most importantly HAPPY FATHERS DAY!!!🎉💙💯
Am sorry bro it's just life keep strong bro we always be here for u❤💯

How the fuck can you dislike this song?🤔🤔
Crazy how they want the father to be there and when he is there it’s like they wish he wasn’t this man has changed so much  for that little girl  and you can’t even give him the chance to see is damn daughter this worlds crazy
I feel for you… feel so bad for you. head up please 🥺❤️
My guy should have no dislikes
this one brought tears to g  stay up chop 🔥😭
Happy Father’s Day choppa 🙏
Choppa don’t deserve to live like this
Great song🎯💯 Ik that shit hurt bruh but since she trippin.. Have another one and show them the world .. I really respect when you said if I blicked him I’d be wrong but instead you didn’t let pride get in the way..🏆
i love how anyone can relate to his music. he will be a legend even though he already is.
I don’t think bitter mother’s understand how much their actions hurt the Child and the father mentally…I’ve been in this situation and even though I can see my daughter on the regular now that shit still hurt her and me too…
It sucks because there are a lot of people that keep people from seeing there own children and it's not right
nle don't worry like my mom said what gose around comes around so no matter what god will make this right u just gotta pray and keep your head up✌be strong 👊
Happy Father's day choppa 💯💥
My mom kept my dad away from us and for the longest time I thought he was a bad father. As I got older and developed a relationships with him I realized that man loved us with his whole heart. Now he’s gone and we’ll never get that time back. Still learning how to forgive my momma, I understand that she ain’t understand the damage she was causing. Happy Fathers Day Bryson, stay patient. Everything will work out eventually
Your daughter has a great father and she doesn't even know it Happy Father's Day Man 🙏🏾
Heat
Ngl this a W

i do anything to see my daughter. yet it’s plenty of niggas who baby mama be begging them to be in they child life. this world is fickle like that

3:40 that lil baby is a mood folk fr fr😂😂
Happy Father’s Day choppa
this right here is exactly why nle is my favourite rapper his music is so real and u can hear the pain in his voice.
Being a dad is one of the most easiest things we as men can be, it doesn't take damn near any effort to produce a child, but to be a father is probably one of the most difficult task we could ever take on, especially one that your child can call your best friend. In life if there is no growth there is no future, and it pretty clear how much Bryson has come. We got you fam and I pray that everything works out for you and your family. Happy Father's Day to all the REAL fathers out there.
RIP to your Grandmother
Happy Father’s Day ❤️ to a real father
Happy fathers Day Bro”
Happy Father’s Day choppa😔

1 thing Bryson has taught me is to stay humble and trust in god 💙💯

[Intro] I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever quote (You're so lazy) Yeah Letter to my daughter (Yeah, yeah) I'm just tryna be your father (Yeah) Ayy  [Verse 1] In the back of the Rolls Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls Royce car seat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you sincе the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicatеd shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat   [Verse 2] Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way (Ayy) I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answer 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  [Verse 3] I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers that's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep Wake up, cook you something to eat Mold you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more that child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  [Bridge] Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  [Outro] They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you
@nle Choppa did it again congrats and keep up the good work

CHOPPA if you see this bruh just know it’s only too late if you never try. That baby girl will see this one day and know you were there trying. Keep it up bro. Never let a toxic baby momma push you to giving up. It takes a lot for someone to admit the mistakes but it’s necessary for growth. God bless you and your family big dog.

Happy Father’s Day tho song slaps g
this song is sad an i wanna cry am only 16 but i feel his pain. being a dad and seeing your daughter  calling a random guy dad  hurt a lot. My father is 54 and it's been more than 9 years that i've been seeing him calling the daughter of another guy, and another girl babe. he's spending all his money on them and he's not even taking the time to come and see me. it's been more than 8 years since the last time that i saw him. Nle is 18 and his more mature and he knows how to take car of a kid and my dad is 54 but he knows nothing. good music and keep up god is with us
Let nle see his daughter bruh 💔
On father's day❤❤
Mans crazy he’s completely changed. it’s crazy
My respect for him is through the roof the emotional power of the song was amazing
Let him see his daughter

[Intro] I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever quote (You're so lazy) Yeah Letter to my daughter (Yeah, yeah) I'm just tryna be your father (Yeah) Ayy  [Verse 1] In the back of the Rolls Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls Royce car seat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you sincе the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicatеd shit so I don't see you She put the police on me, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat   [Verse 2] Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way (Ayy) I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answer 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  [Verse 3] I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers that's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep Wake up, cook you something to eat Mold you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more that child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique than a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  [Bridge] Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  [Outro] They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you
Stay strong we love you bruh keep taking care of your daughter you a real men you 18 do more then other dads that don’t be thare for they kids❤️
This is a good song

Dont worry bro keep ur head just know that ur daughter loves u with her heart keep ur head much love
This hurt the heart. You got fathers out there who don’t care or attempt to see their child. But  the ones who would do anything to see their child are kept away from the child due to the other being childish. We love you NLE & you’ll see your daughter
He out here really doing more than alot of father's ik I would be blessed to have a father like him mine left but life still goes on and u may not like him but u can't lie he out here doing wonders for that baby girl
IM ADDING IT TO MY LIKED SONGS IN SPOTIFYY
his grandmother didn't get to see her great granddaughter. That almost made me cry. But like nle said god got us in the long run.
His thumbnail looks awesome that smile was hard man👏👏
Hope the Daughter Gets To See this When She Grow
This hits different 😔 I hope you’ll get to see your baby girl soon 🙏🏽💗
durkio would’ve been crazy on this
Can't imagine how him and hopsin and other pops being feeling
Why ain't nobody seeing my comment or liking it
Whoever is reading this you  Will be rich and successful in  Life and God bless you  Amen 🙏🏽
This is just beautiful ❤️
“God give us challenges to see us make some progress”❤️‍🩹💯
This song hit diff you got a child 👶 that you can barely see keep doing what your doing
Dang he hitting this song fire no cap but u would get the money first then take care of ur kids but nle he trying to get his kid so he can be a good dad he not trying to be a dead beat

Women need to appreciate the ones thats there and wanna love and raise they child.... these dead beats are the ones that need to suffer. Not the ones fighting they hardest to be in their childs life. Happy father's day NLE. Wish my BD had sense like u.
A I just a lil 7months ago I feel every word he spittn
Growin up without a dad made this song hit even harder, kills me to know that there are fathers and  mother that WANT to be there for their kid but the other half won’t let them. You never abandon your own blood❤️ Such an amazing song Choppa, RIP to your Granny g, hurts me to know she never got to see her great granddaughter. You doing everything right though Choppa and you gonna keep prospering!! Keep your head up man, us fans are here for you 100% for the long run!!!
There are a lot of dads out there being dead beats and he's  actually trying to be there for his child let him see her.

This made me cry. I was released from the police department yesterday. I called the police on myself for domestic violence. I hit the father of my children. I can’t see my kids right now. I’m struggling right now but I will do right. I hate today is Father’s Day and I just hit my baby daddy on Friday. He doesn’t deserve that and that’s why I’m glad that moving forward we’ll live separately and only communicate about the kids. Right now I’m just trying to live right for myself and for my children. Thank you for this song.
He is the best father Happy Father's Day 🙂

I went through the same shit with my son, i couldnt witness his first steps and a lot of his New words, court took so long i couldnt see him at all for 6 months which is a lot at that age all because his Mother didnt want me to get 50/50 when we broke up and i was persistent so she called police on me. I finally got to see him 1 month ago and been seeing him every two weekends, which doesnt satisfy me but at least i can see him, this song spoke to me, keep yo head up bro

Happy Father’s Day NLE Choppa❤️
Man, hard situation.Hope it gets better G.
Msm flow?
This shii fire and he dropped it on Father’s Day choppa one of the hottest rn
🐐oated
I felt when he said “nigga call u something else I bet I’ll correct his grammar” cause like that Mariah said happy Father’s Day to him and that ain’t even his child
🔥🔥🔥
Wow it’s crazy how we wouldn’t think he’s out here fighting for his child. All along I thought he was able to see her. It saddens me because my father was never around until this day I’m 23 and never got to meet him. I don’t know what he looks like and when I was a child shit affected me like hell I felt abandoned and alone. My mom had to do both roles as a a parent. Choppa is really a changed man trying to be there for his daughter. It makes me so sad that he can’t see her when he wants too. If she only knew but she’s a sweet little innocent baby. I just pray to god everything turns out to be better for him and the baby. I’m sorry chopp you have to be going through this. I hope you know you’re the male representation I needed as a child but never received. Thanks for being such an inspiration to me and so many others god bless you
young goat
Braylie 😔😔🥺🥺

He really gets my respect he set his pride  of being hard and talking bout killing and shooting away and made a transition to a real ass topic🗣 some rappers can never do that.
Mariah let that man see his daughter 🙄
“ miss you in my arms” 😭 that’s sad
Happy Father's Day!!!!
Mariah see thid
All the females taking Mariah side cause she said he shot at her house but if choppa said she shot his house y’all wouldn’t believe it all and plus she ain’t show y’all no bullet holes in that house😑
Who remember in Empire when Hakeem daughter was taken 😭😭😭 similar to Choppa story very sad for ma hommie

Choppa did not have to go throw all that he just wants to be a father like if u aggre
This hard
Whoever his bm let him see his child u shouldn’t keep ur kid away from his father
She dead worng for that g😤😤
“Please, no pitty for ah G, tho I got a daughter that I barely get to see” that don trip influence
congrats bro keep doing what u want respect my g
Awww 🥲
wow!!!
But shii I feel everything he trynna say
How can you dislike this song
"I never put my hands on a women, wasn't raised that way" ❤️🔥

Happy Fathers Day Choppa
"Just like yo daddy"😭
Damn that song hit dif NLE is a legend with a story that needs his daughter...
She needs to learn to keep personal feelings toward NLE out of the picture, in the end it’s only hurting Clover.
🔥🔥💜💜
You a strong G my boi💯
R.I.P to ur grandmother things get worst every day we live but live a life that u won’t forget we only live once
lowkey youngboy vibes but this 🔥🔥
Lately I been losing sleep and it’s been hard for me to eat 😔💔
Bruh all he wants is a second chance with Mariah and his daughter.much love for him
proud of you choppa
Felt this one hard.
my respect for this man is very high
Nobody gonna say anything about his grandma? R.I.P Mattie Bell Potts🕊💫
My baby mother knew I was the father, broke up with me for a dumb reason. Moved to another state and gave our baby for adoption. I didn’t even know she was pregnant. Now she regrets her decision She’s left with nothing but regrets  And our daughter is still mine in the end. My new gf and I are going to try and have a child soon. Happy Father’s Day
Wait until TikTok finds this
Dropped this on fathers day and I feel every word. I don't see my much but want him to meet my grandparents before they pass. My GMA on my mom did 2019 on Christmas so I appreciate this song Choppa. It definitely gave me some relief during this battle to be in my son life

Awwh happy Father’s Day choppa. I pray god change your situation
Rip grandma choppa
I say it all the time, most fathers are not around their kids, not because they are dead beats, but because the mother is not letting them see their kids
All the dislikes are from the mothers friends and family
When tha  hard shit finnna come    like Grab my Gun snippet
This shi got me crying
Stay strong
shit im late but this was some real heart warming music
This heavy influenced by Don Trip
Choppa: I wanted a child just to have something to live for.  Me: bout to cry
Man I know what's it's like to not have my real Dad now I'm a dad.       Do good choppa
Nile da boy and😇of rap
Riah did him wrong
Happy Father's day!!! Big chop
Rest In Paradise to you Grandmother, I heard about the funeral. One of your aunt's is my teacher in Ruleville, Mississippi
Now it’s alright man all u canto do is wait if u believe in god he’s going to  prosper all ways
I feel this to my soul man. I didn’t get to see my son from 1 years old to 2.5 years old and it was hell. Baby momma was on some complicated shi. Sucks being a dad who wants to do more than just pay child support. Like NLE said these kids need support as in their father in their life. Now I have my son who is with me 24-7. So anyone struggling with this right now there may not be light at the end of the tunnel but things will happen in Gods time. Stay strong keep ya head up G
Next G.O.A.T of the next generation 🔥
gang gang
got me in tears .😭😔
Happy Father’s Day chop ❤️‍🩹!
here before 1m
flight needs to hear this…
Shittt🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
[Intro] I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever quote (You're so lazy) Yeah Letter to my daughter (Yeah, yeah) I'm just tryna be your father (Yeah) Ayy  [Verse 1] In the back of the Rolls Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls Royce car seat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you sincе the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicatеd shit so I don't see you She put me on the police, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  [Verse 2] Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way (Ayy) I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answer 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  [Verse 3] I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers that's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep Wake up, cook you something to eat Mold you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more that child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique then a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  [Bridge] Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter  [Chorus] Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  [Outro] They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you  DROP A LIKE Thanks
Aye I can’t even lie chop in his bag 🔥🔥🔥

Wow, only fitting its fathers day. Been waiting for a track like this to come out. Women been objectified a lot in rap and it's great to see somebody like NLE who's my age giving a different prospective. Its easy to make a song about sex and drugs but this real substance. Hope my guy works it out and gets more time with his child- much love bro

LYRICS like so everybody see: I said this shit might be the realest shit I ever wrote (Ayo, let me hear that KF) Might be the realest shit I ever quote (You're so lazy) Yeah Letter to my daughter (Yeah, yeah) I'm just tryna be your father (Yeah) Ayy  In the back of the Rolls Royce, you came to with your shoes on Finna cop a Rolls Royce car seat for my newborn Baby girl, you're blessed because I know some kids in group home Ain't seen you sincе the week that you was born, miss you in my arms Mom be on some complicatеd shit so I don't see you She put me on the police, at the end of the day, it hurt you Kinda hurt me too, never let life lessons break you Evaluate the mistake and just wait on your breakthrough All for you Clover, I turned over a new leaf But I get the type of treatment that belong to a deadbeat Know that God and the universe be workin' for me Seeing you grow up from afar tends to scare me Even though shit got rough, I'm still prayin' for your mama Hope you get the chance to see my grandpa and my grandma 'Cause they getting kinda old, and grandpa been getting sick So Mariah, if you hear this, can you please complete the wish?  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  Last time I tried to see you, went to jail on that same day Fightin' two felonies 'bout you and I got another case If I shoot in the house that you in, take my breath away I never put my hands on no woman, wasn't raised that way (Ayy) I wanted a child, just to have something to live for Now I'm dyin', just to see you, something that I'd kill for Tryna be a co-parent turned me to a no-parent Feeling like a transparent, what I tell your grandparents? I'd cut my feet off just to see your first steps Bad enough I wasn't in town to see your first breaths Might not hear your first words and it's hurtin' me to death Every time I try to do right, I get played to the left Never take it for granted, shit like changing your Pampers You're nothing less than a goddess, you better not lower your standards A nigga call your somethin' else, bet I correct his grammar Any question that you got, I promise, I got the answer 'Nother nigga playing a role that I was given A feeling she might be calling him daddy, got me the sickest, so I'm trippin' If I slid on that boy and got the blicky, yeah, I'm tripping Gotta separate my pride from my feelings  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  I can't really call it pain 'cause I know this shit a process God give us challenges and see us make some progress And nothing from this situation I can say I regret Wouldn't even hit a reset, learn something life ain't teach yet The walls start to close and this room gettin' smaller Laying in this room mama designed for my daughter Playing this tune that I designed for the fathers that's good fucking hearted but distant from they toddler Read books until you go to sleep Wake up, cook you something to eat Mold you to a baby G, just like your daddy Hope that you remember me, 'cause Brylie, you my mini-me Your mama my worst enemy, I'm praying she forgive a G Tryna put me on child support, all the child need is support Would've gave you more that child support could ever afford Long-term relationships from short-term greed Just be careful what you pick when you the one that's in need Such a big miracle in such a little girl Never let them break your spirit in this physical world 'Cause you make the diamonds shine, more unique then a pearl And I knew that you was mine from your smile and your curls  Letter to my daughter I'm just tryna be your father Letter to my daughter  Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat Please, no pity for a G I know I got a daughter that I barely get to see It haven't been a couple hours, it's been since the first week And lately, I been losing sleep and it's been hard for me to eat  They say Black fathers don't matter, they say Black fathers don't care But more than anything, I'll always be there I love you
Yessir 🔥🔥🔥🔥

It's amazing how he love his daughter the most💜💜...i wished I felt my father's love all my life while growing up. My mama took me away from my dad when i was 4.
My respect he’s trying hard to be a father
I relate this so much mane I’m dealing with the same shit but with my son  it’s gone be alright choppa these bitter ass baby momma’s gotta stop using a child as a weapon. That shit needs to be a law it’s real Father’s out here that actually would die to be there for there kids who actually are portrayed to be something the mother of the child tries to make them seem like.  Happy Father’s Day to all the father’s out there and if y’all dealing with this just know “ it’s gonna work out for you in the long run don’t let a bitter woman fuck you out of being in your child’s life 💯
❤❤
happy fathers day , appreciate you making this video about awareness for fathers/mothers that are fighting for there child
Happy Father’s Day my guy
NLE Choppa Is really growing and maturing and I'm here for it, he is one of the only rappers that I truly support and its so heartbreaking that he barely gets to see his own daughter man...

It’s things like this that society ignores, he is more than capable of supporting his daughter and is changing himself for the better and yet the female is still given full custody for the main Reason being that she is a female it hurts to know that one day I will be susceptible to the same fate

If choppa see this, I love yo music bro. I been watching von sense he started rapping, I love the way u say you miss Von on his comments, and most people say you care for Von because he died, that’s a lie tho. I watched your first music video, and I thought it was fire when you started rapping I got into that go crazy shii. I realize how niggas flex on u for no reason and do some weird shit for no reason. You and Von had a great relation ship before he died. Keep it up Bryson. We love u. Nn we hope u see yo daughter one day. If you died, any kid u had would act the same like Von kids. R.I.P. Von and r.I.p everyone NLE CHOPPA has lost.

NLE ❤️
All.   She.  Looks.  Cute
That's deep
I felt his pain
what a song man, we can hear your soul.
Black men watch who you have children with especially when you are on the come up! She would have always been his child, his bm was the carrier and reaping all of the benefits apparently.
I’m crying such an emotional song
This deep I love it
To all the other young girls keeping these babies away from they black fathers, I understand sometimes there are reasons like safety depending on how ur bd moving in these streets, and if u have ur reasons then do ur thing but to the ones who don't have a reason and just mad bout yall personal relationship outside of the child I want u to know ur mental and need help and need to grow up....if its over then let it be over. Don't hold the kid back cuz u don't want to deal with this person....u wasn't saying that while bumping and grinding...this is called being responsible...u lay with someone u end up hating but then children come whose lives are more important so now u gotta keep dealing with this person for the next 18 to 21 years..be careful of ur choices
This sum real stuff
I'm literally crying just let choppa we his daughter you can see the he's changing
Damn. I felt this song to the bone. Keep going NLE, you get some of us through a lot, your music is an antidote. God got us just keep going!
The best ❤🙏

Bryson Is Just Trying To see his daughter and he posted this on FATHER ‘S DAY for a reason this man has truly changed and the reason he wrote this song is because he wants his daughter to be with him too and wants his daughter to understand when she gets older that it is not his fault that he is not around her because he is honestly trying and will continue trying to see his daughter this man has an AMAZING HEART One day choppa you will see her STAY STRONG GOD IS WITH YOU BRYSON 🙏🏾❤️🤍🌎

Choppa is a under rated lyricist
Nigga is TALENTED, ik that hurt. but somebody dad goin hard for dem..
this generation is fucked females really out here keepin fathers from seein they kids like brah what is thi
Man this hurt he can’t even see his daughter that’s fucked up
You have Iranian fans man 🇮🇷
My 💙....
This song sounds like my own parents story, (they were still in HS when I was born tho) just more money/fame. I really hope Mariah stops sheltering Clover from her dad..... she will only grow to resent her for that. Ik because I resent my mother for denying me a relationship with my father. I also hope NLE fights to see his daughter. Whether that’s striking a deal with the mother of his child, or taking it to court. I say this because, I also resent my father for not fighting harder to see me. Would talk shit about my mom, but never even attempted to fight for custody, let alone, visitation rights of me. I might be more independent/mature  than average 19 year old now, but I went through a lot of emotional, and mental traumas to get here that was caused by my parents VERY toxic relationship. I also have no relationship with either of my parents. I’m saying all this to say, if NLE somehow sees this he can see what happens to a child when VERY young parents don’t learn to co-exist to be their for their child, and instead play a game of petty bullshit for 18 years unknowingly damaging their child in the process. I wish nothing but the best for this family; and I hope they both come together for a little girl who seems very wonderful/sweet.
Rest in paradise MATTIE BELL POTTS   1936-2021

my respect for this man
Im so down bad i wanted to listen to who i smoke after this song
He is a father even? bro my respect for this man just keeps growing..
I been going through the all exact things. I’ve been tryna be a father to my beautiful little princess and my baby mom been holding her away from me. I haven’t had the chance to meet my daughter yet bc the mother of my child has been keeping her from me. She has police involved and rn I’m in court dealing with this battle just to be able to atleast get visitation rights so I can see my baby. This song really made me tear up bc this the shit I’m going thru and if you’ve been through this and are going this shit, I’m telling you this shit hurts you deep into your core. I wouldn’t wish this type of pain on anybody. Thanks NLE for writing this song. You really don’t know the impact this has on me. This is powerful. Happy Fathers Day NLE Choppa💛
