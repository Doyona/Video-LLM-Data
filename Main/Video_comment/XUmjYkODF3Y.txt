So, your basically buying a $1M piece of driveable art 🎨💸🚗
Doug... I'm not with you on this... Nice Ford!
VW arteon got better looks than this Aston
I agree with Doug, the car is beautiful and looks like nothing else on the market. You can criticise the price but what you’re paying for is exclusivity. There are a lot of rich people in the Middle East for whom a million dollar is pocket money and who wouldn’t be seen dead in a Japanese or American car.
25:50 "will hold its value pretty well"
18:18 aren't those also present in BMWs from 2013
1 million is way too much for what you get, but when you consider how much it costs to develop a car, I wouldnt doubt aston lost money bc they only made 120
Like the Rapide but without the good looks. Why would anybody pay crazy money for this box?
I love how Doug shits on GM for using the same turn signal stalks in everything but it's perfectly fine for the million dollar laginda to use Ford fiesta turn signal stalks
not worth 1 mil....
2025 here..China can sell you one of these for £45k now...I don't get this car.
very ugly color.
And then Doug says Maseratis are overpriced
Doug Demuro will like the looks of the Australian sedan that inspired the Logonda. The Ford Falcon G6E FGX series. (2015-2016).
A Rolls-Royce Phantom, at almost half the price - is better than this in every way. Every Rolls-Royce is better than this. Every Bentley is better than this. Mercedes-Maybach is as good, even better in some aspects, than this. The top-line Land Rover Range Rover is better than this. The top Porsche Cayenne or Taycan models, specifications and configurations are better than this.   All cheaper significantly, a lot DRASTICALLY, majorly cheaper (by an order of magnitude). It probably cost about £60,000 to make. Ridiculous to sell it for more than 10 times that amount - it’s literally more than a 1,000% markup. It’s inferior to all the other car brands and models i’ve mentioned in almost every way - apart from ‘exclusivity’ (which means nothing, as this car has an aftermarket garmin ‘infotainment’ system, ford parts, and is basically aston martin’s significantly cheaper and less exclusive car in every way, with parts borrowed from an even cheaper, even less exclusive aston martin model).
wrapping an £80,000 (if that) in a bit more leather - especially wrapping cheap components in or around more leather - does not add another 0 to the price tag. A Maybach S680 is literally nicer, at a third of the price. A regular mercedes s-class is just as good, and you could get, what? 4? 5? or even 6? For… the price of this car.
I really can't see how this looks better than an E38
i’ve never been more underwhelmed by a car after hearing its price tag. There’s cars in the 100-150k price range that are as nice, if not nicer and with more luxury than this
This is a horrible car. It looks like an audi, it has plastic everywhere, the interior is boring, and it's the same price as a Bugatti. If I had a billion dollars I would not buy this shameful car.
just a million dollar honda
2x as expensive as a Phantom and somehow less luxurious
It looks like an oversized Honda Accord, from the side view at least.
Oh wow a longer mazda 3
Nothing beats the look of an S-Class
they shouldve copied the tesla model s/x. for a million dollars the door handles should be greeting me
I think Doug is only kinda correct here. Rolls Royce will often do Special options with huge pricetags for customers with a good Standing that are willing to spend the money.
Best 4 door sedan Doug has ever seen??? What is he smoking this episode lmaoo Love you Doug but this car looks mid
that's the least impressive million dollar car, a Mercedes s class at just 100k USD is way fancier or even a maybach that at least have business seats
What a crap!! If I knew it esrlier, I would not have bought my Bugatti 😅
Lagonda, "teh rough" not ta  'raaf.
Where in the hell is the MILLION DOLLAR FEATURE 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Garbage 😂😊
@DougDeMuro gonna be robbed and be made my little bich
When this is in my youtube recommendation in 2025, I thought it's a review of new Dodge Charger.
Who said rich people aint stupid?
It’s a money grab car
Get rid of the stupid chrome work.
This car doesn’t even look worth what they are asking for it
1 million dollars and NO DIGITAL DASH??????
i find it ugly..
Dodge charger/Genesis g90,  Aston Lagonda waited way too late to redesign this!
2025 checking in 💵500k 💵 has been set on fire . Car is now worth less than half purchase price.
Why show expensive luxury cars no one can afford and will never own?
At first sight I saw an elongated Malibu from 2010 along the side and back with a late 90’s Cadillac Seville grille.  Mind-blowingly stupid automobile release but obviously this isn’t for shrewd automotive consumers.  My ‘18 Mazda6 is aging like the finest of wines.  That, the late 90’s 7 series, and mid 90s Acura legend will always set the standard for sedan beauty for me.  What passes for luxury auto in 2025 is as laughable as it is saddening.
But why
Looks like a luxury stretched Honda Accord 🤔
Front headlights looks like 2014 Ford Taurus 🤭
$1M…I’ve just spent the most I ever have on my third convertible, a last year(24) Audi A5 Cabriolet. One of the few with both heated and ventilated seats..  I guess if you are a billionaire the car you reviewed is affordable. But to me, I accept that I can have a blast with my Audi at less than 1/10th the price.
Arabic realised this is intended to scam them, hence its availability in America
Aston martin cars always look fat. May be they cut some fat with this.
Taraf sounds like giraffe
Looks like a budget car with no real style and some chrome
a typical British scam.. offer nothing but overpriced ..
Haha side profile looks like the new charger EV
What a nonsense of a car! No sane/normal person will ever buy it, only sheikhs and drug lords. For them 1 mill is peanuts. You buy this car to show other sheikhs you have one. Then why not 5 mill? 10 mill? The same persons will still buy it to be even more exclusive. Aston Martin, your financial people suck.
Someone overpaid 900k
I would rather have a Rolls Royce 😬
This ford fusion has a crappy paintjob and eye-searing interior color.
bruh it looks like a modded ford fusion. Doug nutting himself over it like a simp over a vtuber. $1mil? There ain't even no chandelier or cathedral pipe organ inside. #Trash
Seen one irl. Unique car!
Genesis is better
My life is bizarre and quirky!
Although Douh said it's the most beautiful sedan, I cannot help but notice the resemblance between this and the genesis G70.
Rolls Royce looks like it's a value buy compare to this overpriced POS....
This is most insanely overpriced car I have ever seen, I can't see any reason whatsoever why would you choose this over a Maybach or a Rolls Royce
What on this car is worth 1m dollars ? It don’t even got a usb c port 🤣
It is literally only a matter of time now, until we'll be hearing about the quirks and features of a crashed million dollar car with Doug.... 🙈🙉🙊
I would personally love to see Aston Martin make a full size luxury SUV to rival the BMW X7 and other full size SUVs in that segment.
If Dodge made a good Charger successor this is exactly what it would look like
It is so low in the front you would do expensive damage is you went through a dip too fast. I liked the old model of the Lagonda better.
ford fusion refresh go hard
I thought it was an April Fools special.  *checks upload date*.  Now I'm even more puzzled
A BIG miss
the intense truth is you will never able to have this car
I don’t see it. Not for 1 million. It looks like a stretched out, modified Ford Fusion with a little Rapide mixed in.
Tariff is right
I'd rather have a ten year old s class. all these features and more. not impressive
The President's limo is a sedan and it costs $1.5 mil 🧐 sure, it weighs 10 tons, but I'm going to make the  argument that it is still a luxury sedan. Worth noting that to move the President in this vehicle (or else move him and this vehicle) costs $2,641/minute on average, making it the most expensive Sedan on earth.
🤮
This car is definetly the most beautiful sedan.
If Ford, Hyundai and Cadillac had a child, somehow.
You must love the Ford Fusion too, because this car looks like it !
Why haven’t I heard of this car 4 years earlier?
This is one of the ugliest cars I ever seen, respectfully
the fact that you can get everything but better than this except the v12 for 1/10 of the price is crazy
Looks like Hyundai wings. 8:06
Looks like new dodge charger
I won’t lie, I was expecting more for that price. It looks less refined and luxurious than a Maybach 62
Ain't never heard of this Aisha hater car. The front looks like a Ford Mondeo. Yes yes I know ford stole Aston's looks, but this is after that
Paid promotion 😢
Damn, this is not beautiful, not extra better than other luxury interiors, not terrible muscle and fast, only the price is here BIGGEST. And that key hole next to the door handle... Milion Dollars are Laughing Loud of this car ^^
"sick new genesis dude how much?"
i'm going to be honest the front end looks like a ford fusion
Yeah I’ll just take a Phantom instead. Much more beautiful, elegant and most of all much more luxurious IMO
What a piece of trash this is 😅 Looks like a Frankenstein's monster.
22:10 so is my 1990 mercedes 300TE… 😐
why not just make more of this cars for a little bit less money ?
looks like ford
4 years later I'm still not sure about that interior.... it looks like sitting inside a baseball glove.
I have that same grill on my Ford fusion 😂😂
2018 Honda Accord up front. Nice rear end.
I love the Matt paint, and it is a pretty car, but the most beautiful 4 door car? I don’t think so. I like Aston’s but I just don’t think it’s that’s remarkable looking. Give me a RR or Bentley any day.
Looks like the new daytona charger
Whoever pays over 200k for this needs to have their mental health checked!
Glossy black plastic in a million dollar car 🤢
26:26 Seems to bounce a lot for a luxury car with a long wheelbase...
It looks like a new honda accord in the front
4 years later it did not age gracefully
I would get a mercedes pullman for that price
Now we know where the new honda headlights came from
the looks have not aged well...
Aston…….Stop it!!!
ich sach mal 80€. damit is der prügel aber jut bezahlt.
Beautiful car, but does anyone else see the current generation Honda Accord front end on this?
this car is beautiful on the outside but MAN that interior was out of date when it was new….
How much did Aston Martin pay Doug for this review?
So based on the entire make sense what u said ( you will never see it in the road)   Poor marketing poor pricing   I would price it around 80000$  Regardless of what AM think
I just dont think this is a great looking car outside… I saw a comment about a g90… I think that looks better outside…
The only reason it costs that much is money laundering.
Doug looks Like a homeless stealing a luxury car on a restaurant parking lot .They had to warn the police station first for doing the camera shooting 😂
Looks like a mondeo with a matte wrap :/
I guess I’m the only one who thinks it’s so ugly.
Doug blink if you need help
What the hell…
If you have completely lost the connection to the reality you buy this.
ford falcon?
Looks like a 13-16 MKZ rear end profile.
Any car finished in satin black looks cheaper...
British can't  help not being cheap using cheap parts from other brands
Looking at the front it kinda looks like a newer Altima or sentra
10:04 well it didn’t stay EXACTLY there
This is a gorgeous vehicle, but in their zeal to make it look unlike the  (lovely) front ends of other AM's, they ended up with a grille that's 70% Ford Fusion / 30% Audi A8. Not bad, but the usual AM profile is better.
lol I know this is an old video but when he did the soft close on the trunk haha my 2003 S500 Benz had this 22 years ago. This car is so over priced today you can purchase an extremely ridiculously fully loaded Maybach s680 for like $245k why would anyone buy one of these ?
styling 10? no way Doug. this is ugly AF. a rolling turd
Doug is the kind of guy who says “having something that special is pretty special.”
1 million and has the ugliest cheapest looking steering wheel 😂
is that plastic in the dash in a million dollar car? ive seen kias with more impressive infotainment systems
im sorry but what are you paying 1 million dollars for ? the car really isnt that beautiful as you claim it to be
The quilting under the hood is amazing
Doesn't even have a sunroof
Not a million dollar nice
For anyone wondering, there currently is one listed for a little over 500k
Not impressed
Usa:" wow my turn signal is orange" Europe : 😒
My 17 passat has a way better navigation setup. YIKES!
Genesis
Is that... scratchy plastic surrounded by piano gloss plastic in the centre console?...
Interesting claim! While the Lagonda Taraf is stunning, isn't the Rolls-Royce Phantom still the pinnacle of luxury sedans? What sets the Taraf apart?
While the Lagonda Taraf is stunning, is it truly worth its price tag when compared to other ultra-luxury sedans like Rolls-Royce or Bentley? Just curious!
Its a silly car to ripoff the oil dudes.
A million dollars, and you can't even lie down in back??   Pass. 😂
lol comapny makes 1M$ car and cant produce high qaulity singal handles? lame
2005 Toyota prius has better navigation
The navigation screen is so terrible.
There is one in Mexico City.  A white one.  There is a YouTube video about it.  Just search Aston Martin Lagonda Mexico
Did anyone in North America end up buying this car?
That's the nicest Ford Fusion I've ever seen.
Doug: Value... 4 out of 10...
In this context the WHEELS look very cheap
I get that Doug has to be excited about this "cool, new, rare & ultra-expensive car", but I'd *really* like to know what he actually thinks - personally.
Meh
Looks like a Ford Fusion from the front
looks like my old 2016 ford fusion
For that money you can get a bmw m4, an audi r8, a mercedes g wagon, a dodge ram trx , a  durango hellcat, a lucid aie, and an 21:09 audi rs 6 avant.
I would send it back to Aston and put in a 6 speed with a clutch
The front reminds me of a ford Taurus and the back of Tesla? Is it just me? 🤣
Worst wuality paint ive ever seen.
1M Mazda EZ6
Nothing special about the exterior design why you so obsessed with it 😂
I fail to see how this car could ever be a million dollars. Hell, it literally looks like a GTA-fied version of a Rapide.
Why does it look like a neue classe from the side😂
honestly one of the ugliest sedans ive ever seen. doug is smoking crack
Garbage interiors
I thought it was that boat of an EV Dodge Charger at first
Can you say long wheel base Repide ?
$1mil and the brake discs aren’t even symmetrical
Jaguar XF rear. USB charging lead cannot exit the storage lid, cannot charge and view at the same time.
Sure, it's worth the price that someone is willing to pay for it, probably by those who have nothing else to do with their money. I do like its looks, but I'd rather have any of a lot of different cars.
The BMW 7 is way better looking
A piece of overpriced garbage.   A relatively standard MB S classe or BMW 7 comes with massage seats and the user interface that is not 30 year old.
This car makes the Porsche Panamera look like a beautiful car
Looks like a Cadillac and a BMW had a baby
I saw old comments I posted from four years ago hati g on this car and I gotta say... boy was I right! My VW polo has a better infotainment system than this POS
Such a beautiful car that is ❤
bro only 1? cant even customize it like its ugly im just gonna get my tourbillon for 20 with the mods bro
Basis Aston-Martin's models are depreciating very fast but if it's for fun only, it's cool.... The Connolly's leather is beautiful and well processed. Styling 10 ? Ok, it's Doug's taste.
The front looks like a 30k car
A Buick Park Avenue  Ultrafrom 1998 would last longer than this thing
Sorry, it's not as beautiful as a Rolls
Not even comparable to a Rolls Royce or Bentley.
Doug, where u get it that taraf means luxury in arabic? 😅😂
i don't get it. its boring looking. seems like i giant rip off to me.
That's a lot of money for a Ford Fusion
Interesting, I've seen him give beautiful, comfortable cars a total score of 40 many times. This is the ugliest car I've ever seen in my life by far, the matt finish paint is awful and he's giving it a 10 for styling.
4:05 Ford Falcon (Australia) front end
Beautiful?? It looks like a Ford
As someone who has lived in Dubai, i salute you for doing this without the ac on. It must have been miserable but you powered through it.
11:42  Aston Martin designed for the UK:  😮“the sun is actually out, open the sunroof”  Aston Martin designed for the Middle East:  😐 “I just want to get out of the sun, make it full leather”
If you didn't say Aston Martin, I'd say it's a Hyundai Genesis
Doug is only person who review million dollar car with Shorts and Tshirt, if motoring journalist/presenter do they would be in suite .
Just because your rich doesnt mean your smart.
I just realized something:  The Taraf and the Cygnet have the same pattern on the seats!
Nice 2008 car
"Is it worth $1 million, well you don't exactly have $1 million bucks to spend now do you? " 😭😭🤣🤣🤣
What’s it worth now
Aston Martin needs actual sports sedan
Looks like a kit car cadilliac CTS. AM is nuts. Doug is Biased on this one for sure. Lost me at the front of this video with its original price. Worse than a rapide but I guess if you make a small amount of model and ask a lot you get away it? Only in the middle east?
The fact this car doesnt have an electric trunk mechanism screams its cheaply made
My mom's 2008 Lincoln MKX had cooled seats. Which means Ford which owned AM had the technology to put ventilated seats in an American "luxury" crossover 7-8 years prior but could not do so on the $1 million dollar ultra luxury Middle East market car.
Lagonda manaf made for saudis))
La Ford Mondieux 😂
Anybody else think this looks like a Dodge Challenger?
7:10 remember the ford taurus?
Wait what, they made a new Lagonda??
Like a Rolls-Royce but sportier.
The Steering Wheel fluid bottle is the SAME with mines Opel tigra 1996.
My 'PINOCCHIO' sentiments, too, Douglass... As I watched this video, I noticed a big-time paucity of features, gadgets, buttons, and bigger screens, etc.........compared to about any and all Rolls Royce and Bentley vehicles......which only cost 1/2 or 1/4 the price of the Lagonda Taraf.  Like you said, you're paying a million dollars for basically, hence, three reasons, none of which have to do with an abundance of features....in fact, the interior of the Lagonda is much more 'traditional' (analog gauge cluster control) and much more 'minimalistic' than other sedans.  1. You're a filthy-rich Arab and the word "Taraf" panders to your psyche-personality. 2. Very good styling (subjective: I think it's a great looking car but maybe not the most beautiful sedan ever as you opine it is). 3. Rarity: Only 50 or so (?) were ever built.
Yikes I love Aston Martibut no thank you. Just no
I saw a Lagonda Taraf in Doha it is gorgeous.
So the target market was for rich sheiks in the Middle East? I wonder if the car has the requisite camel tow hitch in the back and the cubby hole for the hashish? Oh, and don't forget the space in the back seat for the little street urchin that is midnight company.  😮
some guy: hey it's a genesis g90 doug: THISSS is an aston martin lagonda taraf another guy: definitely a g90 bud
Traf in arabic means luxury... welcom all😊
Wow, what a dump car for 2024
Looks cool, like the simple styling but, 150k would've been the proper price and make more units
Super.oke.end.my.lux.aston.martin.lux.vizion.6x6
True car enthusiasts know this as the Pininfarina Cambiano
What a money pit. Fooling rich people.   They should realize why sells are worse than Rolls Royce and Mercedes.
I agree $1m was too high, but the exterior styling is a great successor to the Towns Lagonda. And the gauge cluster is 1000% better.
Lagonda Taraf ya mum
Aston Martin Laquisha
I love it, make more cars design do drain money from rich idiots in Dubai.
Man thats insane this car dont have cool seat😐😐
So, the justification for the price tag is that almost no one can afford it, thus assuring exclusivity. That's actually quite hilarious.
If Tesla or another brand Doug wasn’t a fan of made an exclusive version of something with the only difference being exterior styling and minor interior improvements while costing 10x, that car would get 0/100
I miss carsandbids Doug
Putting a bottle cooler for keeping alcohol chilled in a car intended to be marketed in the middle east where drinking alcohol is against the religion....
Looks like a Ford Mondeo
I just took a dump I'm selling it for a hundred grand It's one of a kind Only one like it in the world Follow me for more entrepreneur skills PS Demuro did you seriously just give this a 9 in cool factor ??? How disappointing and just......WOW
THIS IS NOT WORTH 1 MILLION!!!
A million bucks for matte paint?  Someone must have been on hallucinigens.
Car ugly inside 😂
THISSSS, is almost as expensive as my wife.
With just the headlights on in back, it looks like a Continental.
the comfort score should tell you all that you know
waste of money. who would buy this instead of a RR
Looks retro already
For $1 million you get a keyhole in the drivers door? The Aston Martin Rapide is a much better looking 4 door car.
Fun fact: Taraf is an arabic word ( ترف ) that means Luxury or outmost luxury
Looks like a long Taurus
This car represents exactly the philosophy and tricks of English companies. They don't sell you a high product, they rather hype it up with their techniques and make is sound fancy and then the price goes all the way to X500 times. This car is worth 150k USD max! They are selling it for millions!
A screen in the back seats is not cool anymore. I repeat : Screens in the back seats of a car is not cool anymore.
The grill looks like a Dacia Spring also, Doug 😂
11:12 💀 why couldn’t they just lift up the whole ceiling so everyone feels ok
Doug... the type of guy to say something as made of aluminum... and also magnetic
The most beautiful sedan ?!?! Staaaawp It Doug
Those cars suck more than Joe  Biden.
Бестолковка какая-то...
I saw a right hand drive version in the UK back when it was brand new.
Its wheelbase is wayyyy to short!!😂
Repair bills are so high that owning this is probably a mistake?
10/10 for styling is crazy
Grabs the closing door and says "It stays exactly where you leave it". Noiceeee!
Love the matte black exterior, and the interior is so luxurious, but for a million dollars, one can certainly understand why Aston is struggling as a company. They seriously must be smoking crack.
Beautifully crafted vehicle, but the inside well, a disappointment
Your spelling for the name is wrong, in Arabic like only when saying TRF
I thought the most expensive sedan was the 2012 Maybach Landaulet which was priced around $1,300,000 when it released. However you are correct the Lagonda is one of the most expensive sedans in the world. I do have to admit, this is one of my favorite sedans because of its appearance and how nice it is.
Funny that they felt the need to equip this car with the Aston umbrella when it's primarily intended to be sold in places like the UAE, where it very rarely rains (or so I hear).
They made 120 of these for the entire pl-hanet
Imagine paying 1 million for a 2009 interior
I am an Arabic guy and this is the first time I heard the word taraf 8:31
Someone stole my fusion titanium
For a million dollars, no sunroof, ipad clips in the headrest, terrible navigation system, below average tech even for its era. Honestly i wouldn't say its that beautiful - the Phantom is a LOT more beautiful than this car. I've lived in Dubai for over 17 years and I've never seen one of these on the road.
if doug saw a Lexus badge he wouldn't give it that score
I still don't understand why it's so expansive ? The Phantom is better in every way. I'd rather ride in an S63 or 65 S-Class, or even a Cadillac Escalade V.
Jay Leno says that the Lagonda named after a river in Ohio.  Are we gonna believe Doug or Jay?
I loved the original as a kid, and these are even better. I know the designer, we used to compete against him in historic racing in the UK.
Tooo expensive to look like a 2020 Accord
It is so oooo beautiful. Thanks
Pointless car...
So, yeah I'll take the Rapide. Thanks.
Looks like a massive Ford Fusion
Doug’s questionable eye for “beautiful” remains… questionable 🤨 This okay-ish, mostly bland looking prom limousine is not the best looking 4-door sedan
Expensive stupidity
I just wish Aston had given the Rapide the same extra length the Taraf has. And THEN the Rapide probably would have been the success they'd hoped it would have been! Such a missed opportunity!
It looks like a Maserati.
This is the most overrated car I've ever seen. This just goes to show what oil money does to buyers.
i would rather buy tesla for this speccs and interior . Rollsroyce goes much further than the lagondas at less than half the price . lets  not talk abouit te Meybaqq , they are in different times .
This car would have to be coated in gold paint in order to make the price believable.
Looks like a Big Camero
THIS CAR SSSSSSSUCKSSSS
Bruhh a 7 series is wayyyyyy ahead of this in every aspect.
The most impressive part of the car is the key. From certain angles it looks like a challenger. The infortainment is laughable. The back seat doesn’t come with a built in screen. Y would anyone choose this over anything else is beyoooooond me. The inside looks like they just put leather everywhere n called it a day. Where is the lambs wool carpeting?!
It looks like a Ford Fusion and a Mazda made a baby.
Its rather amazing how Doug manage to look out of place no matter what😂
Looks vaguely like a 2015 Chrysler 200
this thing looks like a Ford Mondeo at front
Best looking four door car he's ever seen. Bro i think you should watch your own previous videos more often. It's ugliest I've ever seen. Front Dodge Charger, rear & sides some concept car. Older Lagonda was way better looking than this especially exterior.
0:30 … today there is only 1…
I notice the gatekeeper to the comments section, but it would be remiss of me not to suggest that Brioni, Tom Ford and Zegna are all famous for tailoring, if I may be so bold.
God damn,  this car probably cost 40k in material to produce. They made a killing in profit off these cars😂😂. This thing was expensive for the sake of being expensive.
I don't see a million here.
Not even a nice car. Just something for people with more money then sense. Billionaires shouldn't exist. Disgusting people
12:00 - A strap to help pull yourself out of the seat.  I kept looking at the video's upload date to make sure this car wasn't an April Fool's joke!  Absolute disgrace of a car!
Not different or unique enough to justify $1M. There should be no parts-sharing at that price point.
I still think about this car to this day.
There weren’t many CJ220 owners either and they dropped to 100k at their lowest
Is he blind? It’s so ugly!
It’s as ugly as the original Lagonda.
Really don't get the insistence on the Lagonda brand. The Aston Martin brand is already so cool and beloved they're kind of shooting themselves in the foot with those Lagonda badges
Doug im sorry man it looks like a ford fusion still
The most expensive ridiculous British car. 1000 000 😵‍💫😵‍💫🤯🤯🤯😂😂😂😂👎👎👎👎
Million dollars and NO cooled seats in the rear.   FAIL
wow amazing bro
Distinctive. .  …? Blue flashing lights on top…..this is bullshit…lights..windows…guess what …rear the doors of taxis in japan open on their own…yeah…….the headliner is leather fuck me!,,
Wow, this is an S Class really, maybe some additional leather on the roof. So my question is: do billionaires not have other things to spend their money on? This car is clearly WAY overpriced, and I'm not nearly as impressed as Doug. What a scam.
not even a fade out animation for the turn signal
I think the new mazda3 hatches have better exteriors hahah that interior is the best th0
Doug this car is hideous
I will say, it's a nice car, it looks good and it's obviously fairly luxury, but for $1,000,000??? Hell no! This should be a sportier competitor to an S class, not twice the price of a fully specced out Phantom. For that much money I'm sure you could have a Phantom dipped in liquid gold and replace the spirit of ecstacy with a unicorn horn, and it would still be cheaper and better value than the Lagonda Taraf, is the Taraf cool? Yes, is the Taraf stylish? Yes, is the Taraf completely and utterly overpriced? Yes.
PAY 1 MILLION DOLLARS CAUSE YES HAR HAR HAR
Beautiful car. Don't know about the million dollar price but whatever. You should at least get ventilated/cooled seats in the back for that price. Also, the finish of the leather looks kinda cheap. As does the steering wheel. There should be no cheap plastic anywhere in that car other than the regulated seatbelt. Just brushed aluminum. Or gold plating for that matter lol. And (other than the front end)does anyone else think it looks like a Rolls and 2020 ct6/v blackwing from the side?
What's the point of making only 120 units? And those seatbelt buckles should not have been covered in leather. A big mistake. Anyway, it is cool.
2018?! The only way this price tag would be acceptable, if this Lagona was from 1998. I agree with the outside styling, it's beautiful , but that's about it. 2018 Hyundai Genesis G90 fully loaded beats the interior and specially in options, and it was way under $100K.
the front grill/headlight situation looks so much like a honda accord its crazy 😭 but i actually kinda like how the honda accord looks anyway
They should have made like 50,000 of these and charged >200k. That would make way more sense than this overpriced boat.
This is a scam
Nice Mondeo
This car was Aston's attempt to contribute to the British tradition of giving terrible deals to people in the Middle East. Turns out you can scam Europeans too!
I’m just not seeing a million dollars. Maybe a half million.
Rear seat ac vents & controls are very crappy for 1 million dollar car! pure ripoff!
You are talking too much
THIS is Doug LGBT DeMuro...
Will I be ceucified for saying that I find this car actually kinda ugly? Especially the headlights mergind with the grill, I honestly hate it
This car was sold for 505,000 at aution.  Just to give some update on the price
I can tell Doug is very biased on this car. Many other cars have these and many more “quirks and features “ and we don’t hear about it. It’s a nice car but after all, this is Doug’s fav
Den påminner om Opel lotus omega. Faktiskt.
Of course, your ranking is subjective in some areas, but this thing is NOT equally practical as the Rapide.  That car will swallow a few ñarg flat-screen TVs! You knocked the Rapid's looks due to its being derivative of the two-door.  SO WHAT!!!  The Rapide's looks are in the eye of the beholder, and the DB from which it sprang is one of the industry's most beautiful cars of all time.  The Taraf is almost Blah in my POV.  A one ft. longer wheelbase means, by need, worse handling.  Quality is HIGHER than a Rapide?  It is, at best, equal, but for the price, it is crappy! Exclusivity? NOT like a one-off Ferrari, where there is only one.  This?  120!
5:51 Is this guy serious?
I was wondering Doug, how bad did your head smell after pulling it out of the dealers ass?😮
The scar
It farts to the luxury of this car 😊
Owl eyes
From the side, it looks like a polestar from behind and a mazda 3 from the front. The front is a mix of a basic V6 Challenger, a Ford Fusion, a modern Honda Accord and clearly a Mazda 3. and the butt... it's just ugly as f*ck
Finally a car that rivals the xj in side profile.
In your anger, Do not sin; Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry and do not give the devil foothold!
I’d rather the 2024 BMW 7 series…
This car is normal af and they paid Demuro to hype it up 😂
I would be TERRIFIED to drive this car but maybe that’s just me
It looks awful
Wow how arrogant of doug to just assume that none of us have a million to spend on a car what a dick
Laganda taraf means asshloe side in my local language.
They say, "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder." Doug; is obviously blind.
Nicest Ford Focus Li I’ve ever seen with iPad minis in the bakc even
Back when Doug wasn't compromised
How wonderful would it be if the Lagonda would share the technology and the dashboard from the DBX
I love ur fully detailed explaination
For other expensive cars that's too little  For the sedans class, that's too much.
Looks like a SAAB
1 million dollar to open your trunk manually like peasant
This car sucks LMAO
Fuckin ipads in the back of $1 million car
I've been looking at recent sales of this car and the average price is $406k, the lowest sale being for $293k.
nicre xar
wtf the most beautiful of what hahahahahah
Ladonda 𝙏𝙖𝙧𝙞𝙛𝙛 is what they should’ve named it.
Ladies and gentlemen, the most overpriced British car ever made.
This Lagonda just like your other video seems to be a car designed for a person who has a personal driver where the real luxury is the back seats
Shame on you Aston. A million dollar sprayjob and leather
Nice car , but I'll stick to RR ..
This thing will not hold the Price longer than an old matratze
Seeing the strut thing for the door gave cheap
From a pure car perspective a BMW 7, MB S or Audi 8 better than this over priced piece of dung, just sayin.
I don’t get why Doug finds this car so beautiful. The first thing I noticed was how the exterior styling is rather boring. Aston Martin, to me, has always had rather subdued styling (a factor of the British lineage?), but this one is particular dull. Rolls Royce is still the epitome of luxurious styling to me.
$1,000,000 and it doesn’t come with tinted windows? What a joke
Taraf in English is Ford Fusion.
Can someone explain to us non rich peasants, why there is a buckle in the rear center console?
They must have mistakenly added an extra zero to the price tag. ...and look, it's got an optional see through windscreen.
Those red brake calipers look tacky
Looks like a very nice Honda Accord upfront.
I'm definitely going to buy this car! If I ever manage to find one in a dealership.
**Lagonda is Aston Martin's luxury brand**  Yeah good to know. Apparently Aston Martin themselves aren't luxurious enough
The car was built for the middle east market, but it includes an umbrella. 😅
7/10 comfort waaaaat are you paying for??
I’ve always wondered, are rich people actually watching the screens in the back seat? Wouldn’t most people just use their phones? And if it’s such a long trip wouldn’t they just fly there ?
Doug, I do respect your taste.  But I don't think that this car is the most beautiful sedan.   On top of it, is way overpriced.   It looks like a toyota-ford crossover.    I do like Astons, for the record, but I'll pass on this one.
I don't know what anyone would have to have for a brain to buy this over Rolls
The front end is giving me Ford Fusion vibes...
The ugliest car in the World and the most expensive
Still Rolls Royce better or even Maybachs and Bentley
Beautiful Ford Fusion
Front looks like a Honda accord
Doug needs to get his eyes checked😂😂 There is NOTHING beautiful or amazing about that car except the check Aston receives from the rich asshole that buys it
My hatred for this car is overwhelming.
Heated and ventilated seats in front and only heated in the back… true luxury
I love your show you do an awesome job
Bro, just a tip: dress according to the subject of the story. And get someone to write better texts.
1 million dollars for this Lmfaoo 🤣🤣🤣. The Mercedes Mayback has wayyyyy more features for way less money lol 🤣🤣
Never mind the pissy leather strap, for that price why won't the seat rise and pivot to assist you with your exit?
For that price and there seems to be absolutely zero window tint.
How vain.
Late to the party, but if I paid a million bucks for a car, I'd WANT a Garmin GPS.  Auto manufacturers have no business trying to arrange custom systems.  Just grab something that works off a shelf and the customer will never have to worry about it.  :)
A higher styling rating than a Pagani Huyra? Really?
The windows are just like or some what like the mustange 2018
One of the most stunning sedans for sure. The Speedometer is in KMH and MPH simultaneously. Not worth a million dollars?  Well, unless you just love the looks the authenticity, the brand, and the details.  Its a lot better than many faceless cars, and some spend that money on eg tasteless sportscars,. It's a nice one to have, as a third car or such.
Canada uses kilometres too (only US use miles)
For a million bucks I don’t want an interior color that looks like someone mixed the mustard and ketchup at the condiment bar.
I feel like its worth it if YOU see Aston Martin like that and value the "Lagonda" name. You are paying for some quirkiness, like custom ashtrays🙄😂. It seems almost him saying the name is a joke. Beautiful but not a million. Exclusivity ok, but it aint a Vincent van Gogh. I feel like he's half saying its fabulous but on the other hand its mainly because its exclusive that looks good. Start spending a million or better it better be gorgeous to a point. But a million i expect far more Ford turn signals 🤔🙄🤦🏾‍♂️😆😆😆😆
It’s ok. 😅
Royce boat tail is the most expensive
TURD
The back end is ugly.
1mil dollar car and you need to open doors yourself? wow... doesnt even have running turn signals or normal screen\control for rear climate. Doubt I will ever understand people who can afford a car like this that doesnt have everything. Moving in two Phantoms would be much more luxurious.
This thing is hideously styled for a British car. British cars are supposed to have the nicest styling! What is this crap 😂😂
If you think about it like its GTA, if you buy this vehicle you will own an actual unique vehicle. Even with a Bugatti there may be another one in a different color, but this thing is so undesirable, I'm pretty sure it will be truly unique. I think its undesirableness is actually its only selling point for that price.
Only 120 of them for the whole planet😆 there are probably 100 rich people that would even buy that rather then a fully loaded Phantom
Even if i had the money this car is overrated and ugly lol this guy just sucking the brand name so he can keep reviewing
Simply..it's not worth it....🚶
Bmw 7 series is nicer and at a fraction of the price. Doug must being paid to compliment this car
annoying dude, get to the point, wobbly wobbly, wiggly wiggly, sheesh
What a piece of junk!!! Sorry
The most handsome sedan thereis.
Huh? Wasn't the Bugatti a million dollars?
A million dollars for this, really?
This thing makes a Mercedes-Benz S65 AMG look like a people's car.
hier is er
Nice rims from passat
My 2023 touring crv has a better gauge cluster than this lmao
That Lambo has a Bugatti paint job. A little wierd
Damn saw one of these in London with a Oman plate it was beat up not took care of at all
anoher flop , just like Rapide
Crap car and presenter........looks as though he is about to have a seizure......
Tbh this car looks unfinished
The poniac azteck looks better than this hunk of junk it's not beautiful the bmw e38 is the most beautiful sedan ever made
I love how a very everyday feature like a yellow separated turn signal makes you go wow and think of it as luxurious
Looks like a mazada 6 🤮
Fewer people would buy it if it was twice cheaper
They didn't want a panel between the windows. So they put a plastic panel and... Put glass over it?
Looks like a Ford fusion and a lincoln mk had intercourse
My 2023 760i is light years better than this and I got it for right around $120K.
Am I trippin? An s class Mercedes looks way better than that
I can’t tell if he’s being sarcastic when he talks about how beautiful the car is
I'm 643lbs American and bought one to impress females. Unfortunately I still could not get consent for coitus
S class  and 7 series are far more luxurious than this waste of money
When you look at Rolls Royce you think of money and power this is like looking at a Aston Martin db11 but long and the inside is just leather. After you watch this go look at any other luxury sedan, Mercedes Maybach, BMW 7 series which is a bit sportier, Bentley or Lexus. All of them are on another level.
Wawo the most luxury logonda traf sedan car
A million and you don't even get privacy windows? 🤣 Shambolic
G90 is nicest
This car is a midday robbery
Sorry, Lagonda is not worth the money. The devil is in the details and Honda just seems to be a better value that a Lagonda. I dont know why Luxury cars cannot do it right: they are overvalued and they do not have the technical quality that is expected for paying for that price.
2016 ford taurus is so inflated nowadays
2016 ford taurus is so inflated nowadays
Huiaf
It is a beautiful car, but the black satin paint looks like a wrap or something. Such an elegant car should have elegant paint in my opinion. Any time you put satin or matte finishes on a car, the lines are muted and often lost. This car has great lines that need to be showcased.
Arab money
typical english man show love to english vehicle.................
Looks like some chineese crap.
I can think of SO MANY 4 door cars that are far better looking than this car!!
too bad it looks like shit
I vomited a bit in my mouth when I saw that navigation.
And to think the original brick Lagonda looks more unique and luxurious, specially on the interior.
I love the Taraf! Absolutely gorgeous!
This is the most car ever.
The Mercedes maybach is better
why is RR so much heavier
Nicely fully spec’d Hyundai Sonata
Sooo… it was made to fool arab kings and shit lol
Looks like a long ford fusion with taurus headlights, aston martin hood vents and fender gills but with an awesome paint. Interior is not bad though.
Doug is real. I think its more in depth than Matt Watson  car wow. Still love them all
I dont see the million dollar features...  But its a Nice looking car, i will give it that.
Front looks like a Honda Accord.
Honestly, that's too much brown in the interior. When there's that mucb of the same color, it almost looks like a missing texture in a video game. Beautiful car otherwise.
What an ugly color! Who choses their car to have shit coloured interior? I wouldn't want it if they paid me 1 milion dollars.
Take away the badge and I can't say I'm blown away with the looks of it. Looks heavy and a bit dated already and its only a few yrs old.
"Bice new car you have there. What is it, a Honda?"
incredibly overvalued
Cars and Bids …. where they will vastly under value your car for auction. Do BaT or Hemmings instead. Doug, you’re sitting on your taste - I’ll take 2 Rolls Royce over this LWB Ford Fusion any day. Most beautiful sedan my ass.
Thiiiis...
Looks like a bigger Ford fusion
Aston giving us a masterclass in scamming a whole region with a single car
Worst million dollar car?
I've seen one in Stuttgart last year, probably the car belongs to Morgan Lealizen.
Doug… you normally are spot on. You missed the mark on this one.
Not worthy for shure
sure, luxurious, blah blah blah, but it looks like a ford fusion/mondeo
For retarded oil money
So they only had to make 120 of them to make 120million not bad
Cool 😎
PLANE !
I have an irrational hate for that C pillar.
The front looks hellla like the 2019 Honda Accord
I just saw one in México City and looks really nice 🥰
Over rated, i could mention few cars that are way more beautiful
This is a POS compared to a Maybach
It looks like a car in GTA5
I like the metallic ping every time he turns. Ahhh the luxury 1m bucks gets you
But how many cupholders ,Doug ?
gorgeous car but not worth anything near 1 million.
backseat screens should be integrated to seat they look cheap like that
over priced POS
Great car but those stuck-on “IPads” look cheaply after-market. Integrate them beautifully into the seat or don’t add them at all.
Aston Martin is trash.
The biggest quirk has to be the wheels look like they came from a Dodge Charger R/T!
Looks like a Genesis
This might be the most overpriced sedan ever made.
The world is mad and here is the proof.
Looks like the 2023 honda accord
I agree that it's an stunning design!
Style not ten
that car is for rich gangsters... the corporate type
Overpriced and ugly
The only Aston thats less cool than the Cygnet.  And also uglier.
that's an accord
That’s one ugly car, it looks like a Ford Fusion. Whoever paid a million for this got gypt!!
Aaron Martin fleeced their richest clientele to cover their R&D costs.
Fun fact: there’s only 2 Lagonda Tarafs in the Americas. One in Mexico and the one in the US
A million dollars for that amount of cheap parts-bin black plastic?! The ‘little circles’ in the leather (it’s called broguing, like in brogue shoes) looks like something from a special edition Mini Cooper. And a Garmin sat nav?! Truly an exercise in cynical deliberate short-supply ‘exclusivity’ marketing. Ok, the body is very pretty, and they’ve done it without any real concession to budget, but really - who in their right mind would choose this over two Phantoms? ‘Exclusivity’ of this sort only equals luxury to the very rich and very insecure. And those who REALLY like cheap scratchy black plastic consoles and air vents…
The fact that a Doug DeMuro video is featured in a BaT listing is kinda mean...
Aston Martin is a joke with their car models. I swear this company just loses money on every car model and the executives are just too rich to care
Habibi they werent sold only in the Middle east for nothing i know guys that spent double of that for a camle here
I’m seeing, idk, half the value of a Phantom?
😮🤯
Those Middle East buyers got punked
Should have done an exhaust clip and a 0-60 acceleration test.
see this is great but maybach is maybach
For 150k I could over-look some ripples in the leather...not 1 million+. Everything else is beautiful.
*he's like Laszlo from GTASA WCTR*
Aston Martin paid doug to make this car sound better than it actually is
I really don’t get why someone get this over a rolls royce
I still think that Ford executives at the time... what a bunch of idiots, keepin" the Ford crappy parts. I mean whoever bought the car, what the hell were they thinking? In my humble opinion, that stupid details destroy completely the beauty of the car. Shame on them responsible. as I say. IDIOTS. Only a Bentley  steering wheel is prettier than this nonsense on wheels.
How can you give the styling a 10? It looks so boring. It’s all one line, and the front end looks like a fusion.
It's funny because I find it to be one of the worst looking luxury cars, exterior looks like random car from video game and the interior just is plain bad. Steering wheel is extremely unattractive.
1 million $ car without adjustable rear seats
It's a limited edition they Don make it anymore.......
Aston Martin has never made an ugly car
what a lovely ford fusion you've got here
Front looks ugly
Beautiful car, but it could use a sunroof.
Is it worth one million dollars? Probably not, but neither is the watch you wear on wrist, the diamonds your wife wears around her neck or your gold wedding ring. However, it is interesting that Lagonda is older than the country that produces the Genesis G90 (for those who are commenting on said vehicle), and in that respect more exclusive.
Beautiful it is not. This car looks like a Ford Fusion in the front and a Dodge Charger in the back. Or a Extra Large Polestar 1. Are those iPad in the back? Not even Pros lol.
13:50 made me laugh. If this was my car, I wouldn’t let kids near it within a 2 mile radius let alone have them sit in the back seat making their mess.😂
Well, then, that non-moving glass panel is worth at least $500k
Rolls just destroys this little thing highly overpriced according to my point of view
It looks pretty ugly in my opinion, nothing about it is nice besides the interior which still should be endlessly better. It is oddly shaped. A rapide, an rs7, newer panamaras, 760li, etc, are all much nicer and better sedans
Am I the only one who thinks this car looks horrible?
It’s seem that I am right again americans don’t no class when they see it
For value, it gets -10 out of 10
FANTASTIC review of a fantastic car!
this car is not worth a million dollars.
3:33 I actually think it's ugly. Ugly rear end. I think Doug has very poor taste.
waste of money
This is such a cash grab vehicle. 1M for a car with a GARMIN as an infotainment screen? The Genesis G90 was nowhere near being as much as this car, but it arguably was just as good…
The exterior is timeless, but I wonder if due to rate of tech obsoletion we’ll never get timeless interiors anymore. Interior kind of a let down overall tbh (even for 2015). Those looks tho 🤤
I literally cant imagine why anyone would ever buy this car over a Rolls Royce Phantom. Even for looks. While the Lagonda looks better, the Rolls has so much more road presence. And for luxury of course it isnt even close. The Taraf seems more comparable in luxury to a moderately spec'd S-class, and even then I think the mercades might be nicer to be in.   I officially know anyone that bought this car is an idiot. You want something cool and fun? BMW M8 or Audi RS7/RS6. You want something luxurious? Mercades S-Class is better. All of which are less than 1/5 the price. If you just want to spend insane money for extreme cars, buy a Rolls for luxury or Pagani for looks.
ah yes, $1 million dollars for a ford fusion or 3 performante's dunno what i would pick man
Looks like an updated version of my 1995 Oldsmobile Aurora
Meh. Garmin display. For a million bucks? Really?
The price of 2 brand new phantoms
I wouldn’t put it in my mouth 😒
bro it's taraf not tarraf
This car is ridiculously overpriced. A Rolls Royce Phantom is much better and looks more luxurious.
&&& How Many were Sold?? Design Barely Says "EXOTIC" Therfore Not much Attention therefore Barely Worth $150k & that's Only because of Name. Give it 2 Sand guys who Love BLOWING $$
dodge accord
Not even worth 300k
Btw taraf isnt luxury in arabic. Luxury is فخم which is pronounced like fakhm taraf sound like either تعرف which means "know" or طرف which means "side" or "appendage" if someone knows how is it written in arabic let me know
Dough if you like that thing you have bad taste in cars, it looks like a ordinary car, nothing special, totally overpriced, ugly, the old Lagonda was awesome!
That’s a really nice looking car
This isn't even close to the most expensive car
The fact this car uses a part from a ford fusion automatically invalidates the 1 million dollar price tag. If the phantom was 1 million dollars, I’d much much rather pick that over this still
the truth is that rich people in the middle east got bored of the RR so Aston Martin offered them a new more expensive car.
I prefer the original one…
So retro futuristic! For The mafia boss of the future I can definitely see this in a blade runner style near future flying around. The arrangement of front gives me Honda vibes  lol
In no way is that car cooler than a Phantom. None.
This …… is a 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado with more clutter.
I don't see how a car with less than half of the features on a Roll Royce Phantom or Ghost cost more than both together. I guess if you are insanely rich and want to own it just for collection, maaaaay be, it would work.
It looks like the new Elantra/i30 Sedan lol
Umm yea id take a Rapide for $50k and use the $950k on hookers and blow
I've always liked Lagondas of all kinds. Very interesting to see your video, firstly to compare THIS Lagonda with the 1980's model. Glad to see this one has more passenger room, too. You said you saw one parked up in London. I live there, and I've NEVER seen even one! It's unintentionally an insult to America, to not import it into the country. After all, isn't America the land of the big limousine? So rare , I'd never even seen a PICTURE OF ONE - or even heard if it! So this makes  your best review yet!
This is probably the worst car ever this car is not worth more than 100 grand
This car is not as luxurious as a Rolls-Royce by far
Let’s make a car just for a group of people that are racist and murders
Also, if I were the guys at Lagonda/Aston Martin, I would also wrap the truck area with the same leather as the interior instead of some cheap black stuff.
You know, if I were Doug, I would have stolen that ash tray and sold it on Ebay for 100 bucks.
I just don't see how it is worth even a quarter of $1.
Love how he’s just casually standing in front of a centenario as if he’s standing next to an 06 camry lol
I’m not seeing a million dollars.  Way too much.  Did Doug start cutting his own hair?
This may be the crappiest car review I've ever read in over seventy years as a car nut. This guy is a shrieker, thinks his review is convincing by screaming at you
Aston Martin is just straight up garbage
Imagine being so cheap and just sticking a couple iPads onto the seat instead of putting in a real, luxurious TV.
I was about to look for one for sale until I saw that the trunk inside was not completely covered in leather. Imagine I am about to put my leather golf bag in the car, open up the trunk, ready to lower the golf bag - and then the sheer horror of the sight.
Mayback is way better but not that expensive
Buy one in the Middle East after it has depreciated 70-80% from an oil shiek who isnt worried about making any money on getting rid of it.
Idk - kind of reminds me of a more refined Genesis.
So its just a worse Rolls-Royce
This is as if genesis g90 had a love child with a Bentley coupe
so it's a 200k car sold for 1 million, only with the low production excuse :S
If Aston would have sold these for 400k they could have been a competitor to Mercedes and Bently the insane overpricing killed this car
@6:38 looks like the old grimmace emoji for Samsung 😬
Not a fan of the wheels. They’re too sporty for the type of car it is.
One drives past where I am working in SW England each day, it is a very good looking car.
Looks like a GTA car
The ceiling is higher to not bump the towels on their head. Duh.
Doug: The front turn signals are so distinctive. **Turns it on** A light inside of headlight blinks Me: 🙄🙄
2018??? With THOSE accessories??? I went from watching the 100k Wagoneer to watching this million dollar mistake smh I'd rather drive the Wagoneer every single time.
A luxurious one off V12 Ford Taurus.....
Looks like a genesis
so they just sold a $50k car for a million.
Tell me that Arabs are suckers without telling me..lol
My new dream car. I don’t care that it costs 1mil. I’ll never be able to afford more than 100k anyway. Best looking vehicle I’ve ever seen.
Low key looks like a genesis
The  comment section is a by itself a proof that the people watching this video don't and will never afford this kind of a  car, whining and complaining. Good thing is the car wasn't made with people like you in mind.
This is basically the ultimate more than you can afford pal car. Let's face it outside of oil sheikhs no one can afford it .
This looks like an NPC GTA car
Yeah best looking sedan ever made for sure
bro thats genius. they make only 120 of them so all of them will be sold because of scarcity.  imagine having $120M Cash on your balance sheet at the start of the year bro
I found my way to this video by perusing Doug's list to see which cars he thinks should have a 10 on styling. I don't care at all whether or not I agree with Doug's taste. Anytime a car evokes passion from Doug, I'm enjoying the video. His choices for a "10" are all valid when you remove the subjective aspect. They're all special, just like this one.
i dont care wtf it is or costs, it looks like a fucking genesis
Holly hell, whats this
not worth 1 million
this guy some how got the coolest fucking job in the world, and it makes me so angry
my dads 2500hd has better backseats with actual TVs lol
I don't think it's all that beautiful I think is just ok but overall waiting to see where the price comes in
What a joke. For 1 million dollars and for only 120 units they better damn well make unique turn signal stalks or at the very least get some that are not out of a Ford and that goes 100x more for the infotainment system.
If they'd have sold it for 500k nobody would have bought one- the idiots who bought these only bought them because they cost a million dollars
It’s a lagonda with a Aston Martin v12 built by Mercedes for 1 million dollars
The front looks like a Honda Accord.
You can buy an S class and get the same tech and luxury for way less. Basically you buy this to boast about how much money you have to do stuqid spending.
That to me, is NOT worth a million dollars.
Usually I defend Doug lmaoooo but wtf is this man on?! 4 out of 10 for VALUE, IN A ONE MILLION DOLLAR RAPIDE WITH NO ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL OR VENTILATED SEATS AND A 2008 GARMIN NON TOUCH SCREEN?! (Not to mention $500,000 depreciation in 5 years lol) and 10/10 for styling?!? Excuse me?!? It’s so generic and not unique. They musta paid him for this one
Its nice but let's be honest if AM rlly tried they could add alot more
Noway that price!
I still think the BMW 7 series is better looking. This is stupidly overpriced.
My rating to this car = luxury 8/10 engine and speed = 7/10 but 60% ugly
Terrible wheels and colour . puke
WHERE IS THE TARAF?   HES LA GONE DUHHH
definitely not worth a million.  I'd rather have a Cadillac CT6
The fridge is literally a 400 dollar mercedes part... why...
Doug's videos seriously have the worst comments. So much whinging and rich kids.
Remake the Rapid with more rear leg-room (extra 6" plus).. Duh..! 😂
Doug - Gives the Phantom a 6 for styling. Also Doug - Gives this thing a 10 for styling. What has happened to you Doug?
So,there's a million dollars worth of...leather???
As I fast forwarded, all I heard was “Tarrrraaaafff” , “Tarrrraaaafff”😂 I’m going to have nightmares
I have the 2020 Genesis G90, and besides the horsepower I think it stacks up, for 13% OF THE COST! :)
The front looks like an accord
I don't really see the beauty here
Looks like a ford ngl
Gonna throw the gas struts from the hatchback onto the doors on my Subaru Outback for some million dollar doors
Nice ford fusion
how much is a maybach?
How does taraf mean ultimate luxury in Arabic? Arabic is my first language and I'm pretty sure taraf or طراف means side or edge.
Nice restyling of Kia Opirus
my 2017 mercedes looks more high tech and luxurious on the inside than the 2018 lagonda taraf
1 milyon $ 10 tane ultra lüx araç alırım
What will happen to this s after fuel ban is there a way to convert this into electric reply anyone in contact ments who knows about this
Its spelled =Ta-ruf  That is how arabs says it.
I expected the most expensive luxury sedan in the world to be more... luxurious...and beautiful.
At 24:47 he explains why rich morons buy this car. They buy it just to say they have a million dollar car.
An ashtray in 2018? So in the front seat this car officially has the feature set of a mid 1980s Buick.
This car is worth every dollar of maybe $50k.
Fast forward a year and you can buy an almost-new Lagonda for $655k. Doesn’t seem like that limited production helped curb appreciation too much…
You could buy a brand new Phantom AND hire a chauffeur for the price of a Lagonda
YAWN
Definitly NOT a $1M car. At most $150k worth. Yes the leather arangement is very nice, but to have this cheap navigation, the cheap signal switches and buttons just kills it, and on top of all that it's an Aston Martin, which means horrible reliability and resale value. But, then there are very rich people out there that don't know how to spend their money.
If you think this is beautiful youre delusional 😐
Doug should be the next James Bond baddie... discusssing the 'quirks and features' of some device he has made to destroy the world...
Front end @ 6:44 looks like a Dodge Dart.
This or a nice 400K home, a Continental GT and a Bentayga…
So basically this thing is nowhere near as good as a phantom but twice the price
"There's a piece of glass between the windows" Wow. GET A LIFE. * Let's hope the China-funded, Saudi-Style, YouTube Community Morality Police doesn't censor my comment on grounds of being subversive.
I can't believe you gave 10 for looks of this car. smh
I like the style but I can’t get the image of a Face-lifted dodge dart out of my head
I simply don't understand why Aston Martin makes such beautiful cars which are just so overpriced... Anybody who thinks of buying this one, will stumble upon the rolls royce midway in the price range..
This lad said *LAGONDA* 700 times.....
waaaaaaw :0
Of course this car isn’t worth anywhere near a million bucks, but to the people buying this car a million dollars is nothing so it doesn’t really matter. These Middle Eastern oil dudes blow a million at a casino in a weekend.
Pretty tacky.
Imagine paying $1 million for a chromed out ford taurus
ouuu btw ... almost forgot - where u at my DOG the type of guy comments! ;DDD Let me hit it - Dog the type of guys who finds this car beautiful!
its ugly af! if i wouldnt know the price would think its from 80ies, old school boxy car.
Why make the car longer and still have less space at the back. This is not useful for kids or family either you have to enter from the left side or the right side. And you can't be picking up kids on the traffic side of the vehicle. this should have just been a roadster
Boat tail costs 18 million
I love Astons, but... the exterior of this one is basically an enlarged Honda Accord.
Ferrari FF is much nicer.
my 2018 s90 is way nicer than this!
If a chrysler and a tesla had a baby
Doug is constantly on his knees dude needs to buy some knee pads
I love doug and yes i know people have different opinions and blah blah blah but there is no way you think this looks nicer than F30 series, I’m not saying a phantom just a F30. Cmon this car is just expensive because of its rarity, the Lagonda badge and why it came to exist. Nice looking but not great looking.
Are you sure they didn’t mean 100 thousand? It’s gotta be a typo
Are you sure they didn’t mean 100 thousand? It’s gotta be a typo
What a joke of a car
Million dollar rapid lol this is embarrassing
Why does the front of the car look like a Honda Accord and a BMW i8 ರ_ರ
Good God... Rolls Royce over this junk please
The most over priced thing I’ve ever seen. Umbrella in the trunk!? Give me a Rolls Royce twice.
The front reminds me of a mondeo
front kinda reminds me of the new corsa
also, I don't like that design of aston martin lagonda interior. if you would ask me what is the best interior of ultra luxe car? that would be the maybach' in early 2000's because of its advancement tech. and I would also consider the rolls royce phantom. but speaking of exterior, I like the exterior of aston martin lagonda, it brings the conceptual design in this era.
for some people who wonder why aston martin looks like ford? no, actually ford get the grill design from aston martin because before, ford company runs aston martin. but for now, aston martin is not affiliated with ford. yes, ford looks aston martin and that's fact. you don't believe? then watch donut media about aston martin and ford.
Lagonda is a British luxury car brand established in 1906, which has been owned by Aston Martin since 1947. The trade-name has not had a continuous commercial existence, being dormant several times, most recently from 1995 to 2008 and 2010 to 2013.
Front end looks like a.... FORD FALCON
Ça c'est une très très belle et bonne voiture !!!
So the engine internals must be made of gold. Otherwise I don't know what idiot would pay one million dollars,,  Kia k900 is almost as nice as this car if ya ask me.
Apart from the looks, the Phantom trounces it in every way. Shockingly low-rent dash for that price.
I thought this was a brand new car. this is years ahead of its time, how did i not know about this??
nice ford focus
Taraf in turkish means side
Does the camera man have a knee problem? Why can't he just lower himself to get a proper, level shot of the car?
"The speedometer is in km/h because it was never sold in North America" *angry non-US North American noises*
3:40 That’s disrespect, I think the Bmw e39 7 series is still way better looking than this
To those complaining about price, it's just a quick money grab from dumb oil money.  Aston Martin made 1000% profit on every sale.  They laughed at everyone who bought it which is why they didn't put their name on it.
1 million for a upgraded Rapide
So it’s a Mazda 6 with leukemia making the best of its days? That front end doesn’t sit well with me, cheapens everything else.
Looks like the car you get at the beginning of Martin medrazzo missions lol
Why everyone is trashing this vehicle's interior is beyond me..?
10:25 for $1 million I expect the doors to close quietly 🥴
1 mil $ 🤣🤣🤣
Let me find a spare million dollars from my 50k a year job lol. I would be terrified to drive this car
You can get the new Genesis G90 for 1/10 the price.
Me puedes explicar, por qué al abrir las puertas el video baja unos centímetros? esto en lluvia haría que se moje el interior?
1 milion dollar car and you still get ugly sticking out, cheapo looking ipads in the rear 11:59 .   What bizarre ipad - era is this...
Lagg ON duh
Mitsubishi Galant vr4 really skyrocketed in terms od pricing
I’m stunned it’s a million  My Brian is screaming whyyyy!!!???? I just had to add another comment Remember $1000000 People in Dubai don’t care about money The only reason it sells
Not worth 1 mill  The rims looks aftermarket V12? Really What’s wrong with a 600 plus hp twin turbo v8? It’s a nice car but not 1 mill #sorrynotsorry
Taraf  doesn’t mean ultra luxury it means legacy
Ugliest car i have ever seen
Sorry Doug, but this is hardly the most beautiful sedan ever made. I'd give it a 7/10 and say it's good looking but that's it. A Phantom, Rapide, a Mercedes CLS AMG, a Bentley Mulsanne all have better design. Hell even a Panamera is better looking. Also, the name Lagonda is ugly, sounds horrible in Spanish. The car is okay. Definitely not a RR competitor.
I have no idea why the door being able to stay put at any angle is a luxery car thing. You would think they would put that in regular cars since the people who own them would be the ones who need them. Pretty sure someone who can own this isn't going to need to park next to other cars
This thing is ugly as shit 😂 they really couldn’t come up with a new taillight design? Lmao
those ipads look so tacky $1m doesnt even get you custom infotainment?
Looks like a Ford Fusion in front 😂and a Dodge Charger in back lol  Doug 🤦🏾
Front end kinda looks like a Mazda CX-9
This car must not be very photogenic. I'm not seeing the beauty that much.
Imagine how soul crushing it would be to own one of these, give someone a ride in your million dollar money pump by Aston, and your unwitting passenger offhandedly states "I really like this new Fusion."
No way is this better looking than the e38.
Oh nice, a overpriced Ford Fusion
Love Aston Martin, but  for some reason the interior looks like a nice Hyundai.....
They made the lagonda back in 89
its pronounced turuf
USB ports at the back should’ve been hidden behind iPads.
Chevy impala?
I’m a giraff meme shows off and slides by saying: I’m a taraf
The last time one of these was for sale it was only 370,000. for 1 million I should expect the car interior to be stitched with whale phallus and adorned with golden accents, seems like you are paying for the leather
1M for a leather wrapped tauras 2014😂
aston martin is a joke.
no way im paying a mili and the umbrella at the back
looks like a tesla
the only thing nice about this car is the key
why buy this for 1 million when you can buy a Ford Fusion, get the premier trim level, and paint it matte black. boom... you just got urself a lagoona giraffe
16:55 I believe this is also the reason Bugatti doesn't offer a navigation screen since it's outdated so quickly. I only use google maps with my smartphone sticked to the front windshield.
Lol, this looks like a Hyundai. “The nicest car I have ever seen”. Someone was asked to sell this car in order to get the car to video. A million dollar car and we are taking time to look at turn signals. If the car was actually worth a million, we wouldn’t be looking at turn signals.
One of the best looking modern sedans but for the same price i could get a flying spur as a daily, ford GT for the track and a G wagen for my wife...
Its Plain Ugly Just Ugly  If  I Saw it on the street I wouldn't pay much mind only to say  that's an Ugly car. Doug You must have been paid a million dollars to give  this box such a review  That trunk space is a joke and the fridge isn't even hidden just exposed to whatever You put back there. This thing probably comes with a luggage trailer cause Your not getting any suitcases back they're really. A Ford focus toggle switch really!!!!! Shameful garmen nav really!!!!! Hammie down interior features really!!!!! S1,000,000 car All parts should have been exclusive or upgraded  Best thing of this car is the Key .
$250k at most, nothing more. but middle eastern idiots will buy it without thinking.
It is nothing but a big disappointment for a million dollar.
I think the car looks good but I dont like the front end, reminds me too much of a Honda Accord
#1 its ugly  #2 (see #1) No way this monstrosity is worth more than a Phantom or Mulsanne. I know they discontinued the Mulsanne, but that was a beautiful car inside and out. Stunning example of a Ultra -lux sedan I would say even better than the Phantom both interior and exterior.  Only reason this junk heap Lagonda is worth so much because of the limited production (Even Aston Martin knows no one will like it). I think Aston Martin created this to keep their names in the game since they really havent done anything worth mentioning since appearing in Bond films.
this has nothing on a mercedes maybach even. what the heck
one of the ugliest center stacks ive ever seen, my jaw dropped
Ah, so that's what Taraf means! I lived in a neighborhood in a city with many rich arabs in Brazil called Tarraf which was for more expensive houses. I'm guessing you could buy half the street with one of those, and since it's Brazil, the car would cost triple the price, not to mention that the tax is based off the car price so you'd be paying a Ford F150 Raptor every year just in taxes alone to maintain this car there. When you said its name I instantly thought of the Middle East.
Is this a joke ? not even a beautiful car. like WTF ?
No offense but honestly, this is probably one of the worst Aston Martin I’ve ever seen. 😔
It looks exactly like a Dacia 1300...
Why isn't the ashtray in sterling? I like the cod piece behind the rear view.
anything with the title "worlds most expensive" is usually crap. See worlds most expensive burger, hotel and luxury sedan 😂
there is one of these at dave's discount autos in west palm beach florida for 14,999 with no warranty
There is really Nothing about this Car that makes it worth "1 Million Dollars". Its Just Expensive for the Sake of it
Absolutely nothing about this car screams "worth it"
The whole world:- kilometer Litre Kilogram Meanwhile america :- gallon Mile Pound
STAND BAY
A Lagonda was, is & never will be suited to the American Continent. Americans simply want image. They usually can't afford "sticker" price & lease cars. Theirs  is a country where minorities have the power. Lagondas have SUPERIOR handling to equivalent Bentley & Rolls-Royce. I've got an '87 model. They stay in families for the next generation.
Red calipers. Bitch please
never knew this existed.
The Lagonda Taraf: Just a really expensive Dodge Challenger
The Aston Martin Accord 😂
The interior is appallingly underwhelming
The styling score just does not make sense. How does this get a 10 and a rolls Royce phantom gets a 6?
DeMuro really should have dressed up for this presentation.
Definitely a luxury Challenger!
Still looks like a luxurious yet overpriced Ford Mondeo...
Aston Martin interiors have always been weak to me
Nicest Ford Fusion ive seen.
This car is just to loot billionaires
this car CANNOT turn heads around.
This looks pretty shit for the money
Ugly ass car.
This is the nicest Ford Mondeo I've ever seen
Price is obviously absurd, but I still think it’s a beautiful car
this car is a joke
Idk man id rather have 2 rolls royces
Why did i thout that this was a video from 8 years ago bc his tumbnails and quality hqs changed in years and the stupid cars and bids ad
Loganda sounds like a cheap ass daewoo leganza
Looks like a stretched out Ford Fusion
Nice but not $1M nice.
anyone see that nice blue ford ranger at 24:46
What is the actual secondary market value on these cars?
A 1 million-dollar car and it doesn't even have motorised door handles. Nothing in this car represents that price beyond the fact of existing just 120 units.
Well I disagree here, i think that thing is ugly
Isn't the Maybach 62 Landaulet the most expensive luxury sedan?  When it was made it sold for $1.35million, which, due to inflation, would have been even more when your video was made.  The Rolls Royce Boat Tail is around $20 million, but since there are only a few of those so they don't really count.
doug the only car review guy who would be on his knees 9:20 ... this man really works hard.
24:46 26:48 For literally everyone in the comments
So basically it was made for oil billionaires and dictators in the Middle East.
27:44 y is doug calling me out like dat 😭
It's nice, but not THAT nice to be worth even a quarter of that
yep definitely not worth a million bucks
This car is comical for a 1 million car. Just a jumbled mess…I thought it was a fancy Dodge Charger
It's a huge Ford focus
For twice the price of a Phantom, I want my features, comfort and quality ratings to be an 11 out of 10.
Too much unjustified price. It misses too many things that rivals at less than half the price do feature...and look much better, as well.
HI DOUG STILL WAITING THE VIDEO OF THE LAMBO IN THIS VIDEO PLEEEEAAAAASE
I think this review reaches a high plateau, in your appreciation of aristocratic motoring. The journey through RRs has been difficult, but now you are here: The British Empire salutes you, sir.
Even the trunk is not automatically closing, but you have to pull it down and then the soft-close starts.  Garbage
Disappointing car!!! There is no new feature. Refrigerator??? Mercedes W140 S class had this in the 90’s!  The engines are coming from AMG.  Aston Martin should compete with Hermes for leather products, but not be in automotive business
That price makes no sense whatsoever. Then you realise it still has part bin Ford steering wheel stalks??.... Cya.
Imagine someone saying "I couldn't afford a Lagonda, that's why I bought a Phantom." Good for him / her, the Lagonda is an expensive piece of sh!t. A million dollar for what? Still trying to find the answer.
Verna bro 😂😂😂
You really need to swap your usage of 'worth' with 'cost'. These cars don't worth these prices, they cost these prices.
What a strange name... Taraf means orchestra in Romanian
that door feature is pretty cool
Bmw 7 series,  has 4 million  features and luxury
Looks like a ford fusion
An Umbrella for a car solely built for the Gulf? About as useful as mudguards for a tortoise !!
that car is just overpriced i would have bought it for 300k, its less luxurious than a rolls royce phantom or a mercedes s500
Front look like a Honda Accord. 🤮
Lagondaaaa…
Did polestar copy this
honda accord front end
Actually the word "Taraf", if you put the main stress in the first "a" and shorten the other one, means in Arabic language literally "Luxury"
I see alot of comments about the price but people have to understand the market this car was made for. Alot of the rich middle East countries don't mind paying for exclusivity I mean they have license plates costing millions of dollars so for that market it's actually not all that bad 🤷
Zzzissss is the…. (Turbo right off the start)
the front is a Accord
Funny that he says the car was legally imported "here" in North America, yet when he pushes the key in and the Stereo comes to life it's on DAB playing talkSport.  Amazing trick to get UK digital radio on a million dollar car in the US...
Absolute ripoff
That's the nicest stretched Dodge Charger that I've ever seen.
Thats so extremely overpriced, thats $100k car
Looks like a nice Honda Accord from the front 👍
Ridiculously overpriced car.
not s class or even maybach luxury but my god what a breathtaking design, really what a wonderfull and beautiful design.
It’s called brogue. The “little circles”
Lagonda sounds like the chick who starts shit at the club with her mate laquisha.
Aston Martin Sales Executive: So, who has a lot of money but no class?  Employee of the month: The Arabs.
they gave it this price as AM can get away with it
The Nav screen is just sooooo damn sad.  They literally had those in 01’  Vantages !  🤦‍♂️
The word TARAF is an arabic word (ترف)  which means "unnecessary luxuary" or "opulent".
Where is the vault for a pair of chromed glock pistols incase of attempted carjack?
I do like the paint job and the way it looks. I can't afford it though.
This is Naomi Campbell of the cars Love rear doors!
There seems to be no reason to ever buy an Aston Martin. They are all stupidly overpriced.
beautiful is pretty subjective, that thing looks pretty odd
Nothing about this says $1,000,000     Nothing.          No seriously, nothing.
It looks really ugly..
I wish he'd roasted this car just as how he roasted Maseratis for being outdated and overpriced.
19:16 when he said what exacly is... i throught he was going to say kilometer lol
clearly doug is a  paid ad..
Look it’s a over priced Ford Fusion
Gret car
You can have it.
I love your channel, but once in a life time if U put proper clothes to sit in 1 mln USD car, would made film more....well ... interesting?... or not, yes I am completely wrong here. Value of this Aston as well. ... anyway cool machina.
This looks like a Honda Civic from the side
The camera can't ever do the car justice.
Definitely not worth it
tbh, it looks like a 2012 Camry from the side
I think a genesis g90 is much better than buying this
Hey Doug! Taraf actually means Heritage in Arabic!  It is pronounced Turath 🙏🏻🙏🏻 keep up the great videos ! Been with since 50k buddy 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Beautiful car but the grill looks like an ED-209.
that is just a stupid car
This thing is beautiful.
A phantom is 5x nicer than this piece of junk. This is a joke. The RR is overpriced but this is so ridiculous
As the only sedan ever to score a "10" for "styling", I"m flabbergasted that Doug didn't mention the most prominent and unique styling feature:   the black, satin finish paint job!!!
This is the best looking Ford fusion I've seen
the grill exactly Ford's
What a ridiculously overpriced car! It's net even that good looking and the color makes it look like it has been plastic wrapped.... - Yuk!! I watched the Lexus LC500 review yesterday and seeing the Lagonda I must say I'd prefer the Lexus. It looks way more luxurious, the interior is much nicer, the rims are nicer, its much cheaper AND it's even a convertible.  If I ever see anyone drinving one of these I will laugh my ass of :D
damn a mil & and no sunroof
It is a piece of s
If someone paid that much that's now the price. Absurd, but that's the rich world.
NOT Worth 1Mill, Sorry
Doug sold his soul...
Interior seems to cheap compared to a 2018 Bentley continental. Now you can buy it for 100k, what about the Lagonda?
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and I can't quite agree that the Lagonda is the most beautiful sedan ever. The matte paint job on this example makes it look cheap (similar paint seems to be common among the early 2000s Civics and Pontiacs that high schoolers park at the local Wawa late at night). The literally all-leather interior does look nice, though perhaps not $1 mill nice. For the experience of driving a four-door sedan with Aston Martin styling cues at a tiny fraction of the Taraf's sticker price, do what I do and drive a second-gen Ford Fusion.
a very modern looking ford mondeo
The radio being tuned to talkSPORT when he puts the key in at 17:48 is a nice touch.
its a good car but its worth 300k tops
Incredibly underwhelming vehicle. Good review though!
It looks like Ford Mondeo.
Never 1 million dollars price was 375 k pounds , only built77 not 120 ... get facts right !!!
Yea this car should be like $200K max
Did he say it doesn’t have adaptive cruse control? My 2014 Mazda Axela has that….. 😕
9:41 that has zero to do with gravity doug lol
Looks so basic... Nissan features look better 🥱
To think they made $120,000,000 on roughly 12 million worth of cars tops… biggest scam ever?
It's so beautiful I absolutely love it, if did have $1 million I'd buy one straight away and fall in love with it.
23:20 so we're just ignoring the fact the car was inspected by none other than Phillip Jeffries, the mysterious David Bowie character from Twin Peaks? I'd say that alone is worth 1 million.
Drinking game...take a shot of shitty whisky every time he says Lagonda
I truly love the Aston Martin brand but there is no way in hell this car is worth $1 million!!! I mean come on just think of that fleet of nice vehicles you can get for that same amount of money!!
AMG E63S is better and cheaper than that piece of shit car
This is only 7 years old. Lexus models at the time had better interior features.
Aston Martin must have made a killing on this car
Tbh hyundai genesis g90 looks 10x bettdr in and out
the car Homer Simpson designed is more interesting than this this looks like a scam, like they made this to launder money or some shit.
this looks like it's trying hard to look Luxurious and Beautiful but it's exaggerated.
It’s a cool car but I rather have the million dollars  in cash 💰
Tourath means culture
It really needed 8 more head lamps, two horns, and an additional fuel door…
Ha! That’s what you get for copying Aston martin Ford! Right back atchya!
wonder what the depreciation is on this
2018? I thought it ended production in 2016
OH OHH...THERE'S  slippage in that door  @10:03 like a Audi OB501 7 SPEED transmission.
It looks kinda like an accord. I love it.
Too much hype about absolutely nothing that comes close to being worth a million dollars. Switch reels and move on. Not much to see here folks......
Honda Accord headlights 👌🏽
You are not very enthusiastic about the features of this car 😂
Its got E38 looks but modern and anuff changes to not look like it
So it’s mediocre Intech, mediocre engineering wise, looks like a Ford Taurus and it’s $1 million dollars?? OK!!
Looks like a dodge from the side.
It’s really true that beauty is in the eye of the beholder because I think this car is disgusting looking.
Nope.
12:20 mmm.. that will hammer the window glass
what a dumb way to spend 1 million dollars
very distinctive? this a ford fusion😂
Even if that leather is from newborns it's not worth it.
Only one year later and this already looks dated. Yikes.
Priced new, it shoulda been $150K.. this car is very underwhelming
What car is that blue super car in the beginning looks like the maker Lamborghini
How much is it? What does the logo say?
Really  $1M and no sunroof? The coolest thing is a shity little hydraulic pump that is “supposed” to keep the door at the same place when opened? TFOH👎🏾👎🏾
A million bucks? . It looks ok, I dont know what doug is talking about.Not impressed at all, I would just get the two phantoms.
I prefer the original 2006 Maybach instead
But Doug, how much it costs? :)
Just buy a mybach
A fancy rapide
this isnt a 10 in styling at all. It is a subjective thing but this doesnt deserve the same score as a 300sl mercedes does. For me it would be a 5 or 6 maximum.
Old Lagonda has more luxurious features than this one
Don't like I have to buy iPads for a millions dollar vehicle
Rick from Pawn Stars  "best I can do is $5,000"
echte schoonheid.
Volvo
I guarantee you that if you do a blind survey of this car, most people would rate it average at best.
Holy shit this is overpriced. The leather is nice and the outside has a nice design but that’s about it. No cooled seats in the back in a luxury car is insane.
Nice accord
What the fuck is beautiful at this car? It looks tacky and cheap at beast. It straight up sucks. Looks like donkey shit.
Wow thats one of the nicest Honda Accords I've seen
I could buy a Rolls-Royce for less than half of the price of this thing and I’d have a car better than this one in practically every way. And in terms of looks, it’s nice, but you can’t help but see the lack of build quality on the exterior.
For all the people talking shit about this car 30 years later Aston Martin is worth 3 million dollars because is so rare and hard to find
The car is incredible is worth 1 million or maybe even more
my dad's 2012 vw passat has a sunroof and this doesn't.. kinda says a lot about this car lmao
Looks like a   L   O   N   G   Ford Taurus
Yes so what, I  had a VW EOS where the windows dropped on opening the doors no big deal. This car is a marketing exercise in extracting petro dollars from middle eastern potentates who have more money than sense. Doug spends too much time boringly discussing knobs and tits and too little time on basic automotive engineering, performance  handling, braking and steering etc.
Unpopular opinion... its ugly. I think their old 4 door (the rapied) looked better.
From the front in looks like a ford Taurus 😂
It doesn't look anywhere as beautiful. It looks AWKWARD. It looks like a fusion of front half of one car and rear half of another car. To me,the VW Arteon looks beautiful than this.
peugeot
id rather have the  rapide
Sure looks alot like a Lincoln Continental from that side…
Looks like a fusion lol
Looks like a fancy Ford Fusion
Who would buy such an ugly car? Id rather buy a Kia
So...the grill looks like old Mondeo, and I have front turn signals "replacing" running lights on my 2018 Škoda Octavia. Guess I can spend my one milion a little better 🤷‍♂️
The back looks good, but overall I think it's ugly. From the side it looks the ugliest.
Doug, I respect your vast knowledge of automobiles, the fine job you did developing and promoting your channel (I suspect you may had a long term relationship with either a family member or friend you may be involved with, or, of course you could have done this all, yourself, which would be even more impressive! Having said that, I must disagree with you, with prejudice, concerning your effusive love of this car’s looks, calling it the most beautiful car (sedan) (“intensely beautiful car” “shear beauty”)in the world. I’m trying to find it somewhere in my brain, but I can’t. To be honest, I don’t know where that comes from! Other than being a very expensive (Aston Martin) Lagonda Taraf!   I think, at best it’s is a very plain-Jane looking and boring (looking) sedan. For the life of me, I cannot see:The best looking sedan in the world-no way.
They could have at least wrapped the steering wheel in the matching leather
Just realized you can get an Audi RS3, RS4, RS5, RS6, RS7 AND AN SO PLUS for less money than this🤔
this is a shit looking overpriced car
It’s worth max 1/10 of asking price
this may be the most “middle-eastern” car ever.
Doug is so dramatic with his numbers
Why no Vulcan review
Sooo, looks are subjective.  Objectively, this is a Rapide that is 1 foot longer, that nowadays you can buy for way less than 100k on the used market(Hoovie proved that).  However, they put a fridge and a little more leather in it and that makes it 1 million dollars?
That's a beautiful car.
Gorgeous car. $1mil is cheap!  Simply spectacular
This is a plush car, but it's no-where near the opulence of the RR-Phantom..
Doug is the only dude to kneel on solid ground...with his bare knees and not hurt...
Window indexing to lower the weight of the glass to create better weight when closing?
Garbage. Buy the RR.
I expected an umbrella review as add-on.
It's ugly as shit.
You missed the back (arm rest) has a soft automatic opening and shut!
This is a terrible car for the money. Doesn’t even look good 😩😩😩
Watching this to see how this 2x better than a Rolls Royce, The styling to me is not worth the price tag, possibly it could look better with gloss paint.
This car would of been a hit at like 200,000
1 mill to buy 2 mill to fix no warrentys 🤣🤣🤣
Looks like a high end Hyundai.
*yawn*... Aston Martin is literally the most boring "sports" car manufacturer.  Ironic they built this car for the middle east when most of their customers would throw them off a roof or burn them in a cage.  Oh!  And women can't drive this car.  Disgusting pandering.  Also, this "car" has the same lines as an early Acura 00's sedan.
Why so many dislikes? 🤔🤔  edit: ok... 18 min into the video and after reading some of the comments, I understand
I can’t see the beauty of this car but maybe the video is doing that to me, it looks like a generic sedan 🥲 but the price is insane
Nope . I wont give 1 million to this. İnstead ı would buy much beatiful designed car .
This thing came out in 2015, the same year as my golf and my goodness thats the infotainment you get for 1 mil?!?
JAMES BOND 2020
I’d rather buy a good used Aston Rapide and pocket the other $950k
That's an expensive Mondeo
This is what happens when Aston Martin try to make a copy of the Rolls-Royce Phantom. The slope at the back looks like the new 2021 Ghost
You’d have to be an idiot to buy this thing
Nice, another car that’s only expensive cause it’s very limited
Looks like a Camry. 🤷🏾‍♂️
The rear end looks like a Dodge Charger Doug: “the most beautiful car in existence”
There isn't anything in this car that screams 1million bucks.
Only arab can pay 1 mil $ for this without complaining
How does Doug fit into cars?! ....Look at 9:47
That is gorgeous.
I don't get the point of this car.
Doug: gorgeously beautiful
There's a leak in the back.  Hey, it's blood!
Ford Focus turn signal and navigation system in a million dollar automobile. 🤡
"It's beautiful" It has to be one of the most boring looking luxury sedans.
Maybach Landaulet is the most expensive sedan ever 1.350000
Looks like the modern comtential
See how many folks look at it driving in la ny dubai.0... Boring style
5:38 what kind of bullshit quirk was that?😂 The red light turns orange…But only the lower half😂 Guy has $1Million car in front of him and he points out the most mundane turn signal😂
I love how what’s above his neck that matters, not the shorts and t shirt
$1 million for only 530 hp.  Like, why?
meh
1 Millionen Dollar? Lol 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
so its basically not as good as an S class but costs as much as 10 of em
Because rare
1,000,000 dollars for some dodge charger sxt wheels
Looks like a bad version of a Dodge Charger.
1 million dollar car with cringe worthy piano plastic and nasty air vents
This is not 0.1% as luxurious as a Rolls Royce
doug can talk even more if u put him in a $10k car
10:03 "...will stay exactly...." *door closes by itself*
The Taraf was built for the middle-east buyer where commonsense is almost nonexistent when it comes to automobiles. It's a  pretty enough car but I've seen many cars I consider prettier and I don't like satin finished paint. The interior is very nice but nothing special. For $1,000,000 you could have a Phantom and a Wraith and I'm  sorry Aston-Martin but Rolls-Royce builds a better car, and you get a storage compartment for your umbrella.
The screens in the back are just ipads!
I was impressed until I saw that plastic fridge in the back and then the strange climate controls and that center navigation screen is a joke! NOPE! 😮 NOT A TRUE LAGONDA WITH THAT STEERING WHEEL AND WAY OVERPRICED!😂 For a million dollars, it shouldn't have a bit of plastic in it. Carbon fiber all the way! 😮
What a joke.   1 million bucks!  When donkeys fly!
R35 gtr looks million time better for 6% of the price
I realise now what car it reminds me of due to the front a Ford Fusion !  Yes please stop laughing, I know comparing this to a Fusion  but put both grill photos together and there is some similarities there :)
If it not built for North America how comes it's left hand drive Doug ? In Europe its right hand drive
Not a fan of the brown tan :( It should be a darker brown
Great vid Doug ! Did you notice the La Conda badge shape is of a Gondolier !
You could get nicer results with a fusion and 50k in mods
Front of this car literally looks like the lastest i20 in india 😂 and the side silhouette is more like some Cadillac Sedan idk what makes it look so exquisite and unique ?
Can I put my 2002 Nissan Maxima on Cars and Bids? Got a bit of an oil leak but runs good. AC still works
Mercedes  maybach  is more beautiful than this one
I speak for myself as a rich guy, I would not pay more than 90,000 on this vehicle,  and I would rather pay 1 million for a Rolls Royce or Bentley, I get more benefits more luxe more style more technologies more spacious, And better quality
That is the domestic explanation I ever heard for a reason why somebody should spend a million dollars on a cheap b******* car that car was a piece of s*** then and it's a piece of s*** now
"it is very rainy in the UK after all"  HEY! It barely rained at all today!
So much hate holly shit 😂😅
Love it
At the end of the day that car is bullshit!😂😂😂
No panaramic roof???
My 1989 Towncar trunk closed the same way……..oooooooooooh
man, what a piece of shit. that car looks 20k at most. The interieur, which is arguably the most important part in a luxury Sedan, looks super ass, in true aston martin fashion. But regular Aston Martin models make up for the hideous interieur by their beautiful exterieur, this car doesn't even have those redeeming qualities. And a 1 million price tag? my god, AM had to be high on their own fumes when they designed this car
why
ugly way too long so glad it’s not called An Aston Martin just a Lagonda.  CompRe to the gorgeous wedge shape Lagonda of the 1970s. That car had presence. this car is unpleasant.
And sadly it is severely let down by that matte black half-done job.
mat watson is better
Bruh u hypin this car it’s beautiful but nothing out of this world like the price
Dayum this beauty is pricey lol
I just realized, I've been driving a metal on wheels. "These car is beautiful" - Doug . I agree.
Maybe it looks extra phenomenal in person, but based on the videos and the fact that I've seen the RS7 and Model S Plaid in person, I think those are far better looking sedans.
You can buy 5 fully loaded S600 Maybach’s for the same price as this car.
Uganda Black panther - Should be the real name
The side profile makes me think 2009 chevy malibu.....
Seems basic and a total waste of a mill
The car is rather "fugly"
oh yeah, i want a million dollar car to drive around with my kids
This just looks like the business edition of the Ford Mondeo.
The tail/headlights got way too much hype
It doesn’t look that good, it can’t compare with the 7 series, even the newest 7 series imo. It’s stylish  but nothing spectacular, but to each his own I guess, that’s Doug’s opinion, that’s why it’s called a Doug score. 😊 .
A badge and a price tag can make just about any design look appealing to people.
❌ It doesn't deserve 1,000,000❌ Nothing special in this car!
This car's ugly 😕
Taraf is Arabic word its mean luxury
Sad when your 2018 $1m car has the same grill/headlight design as a 2016 Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid.
Are you serious….it looks like a Ford…overpriced….Garmin?…Emperor’s New Clothes.
I guess it’s a good looking sedan but it ain’t no 10/10.
ONE! MILLION! DOLLARS! (raises pinkie to the lips)
Not sure if I follow his scoring system, for example practicality will always be low for supercars, it's not relevant.
"And the door stays exactly there".....Doug opens the door more when it closes automatically anyway when opened just 10 inches or so lol
LOL Nice overpriced Chrysler you got there
Just get a rolls???
Previously said E38 7 series best lookin sedan? One my biggest disagreements w you Doug
very childish owner with that ugly paint
sauce
I could see this car selling new for around $250k, maybe $300k, but a million is completely absurd. Its obvious they only built this car because they knew there were just enough idiots who have enough money that they would buy them simply to say they own one, not because youre getting a car thats worthy of the price tag. It is awesome looking, but in used form like this I still dont see why they should sell for more than $150k. If I wanted to get an amazing luxury sedan and had a million bucks to spend, I would get a Phantom and then grab the Phantom 2 door drophead with the money left over. 2 cars that are vastly better and more impressive, plus the general public knows they are awesome where as with this car you could tell random people that its a $50k car and a lot of them would believe you. I think its actually the most rediculously overpriced car Ive ever seen other than some crazy 1 of 1 models that can be priced for any amount and some idiot always buys them.
The front end reminds me a bit of the Herrera Outlaw from Cyberpunk
Bro, it’s hideous.
Matte black on a million dollar car...there should be a law against such horrible taste lol.
At this point I dont think id be very surprised if I saw one of those white plastic outdoor chairs as the drivers seat.
Original is better
ridiculously overpriced & over rated!!! It's rare only because Aston Martin would not dare commit to it. 100% stupid sedan.
In romanian language Taraf means a small band, often associated with traditional gipsy music. Something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT4IufMeyYA
The most beautiful car. Attention to design, the shear beauty of it, ah. Beautiful.
That is artomotiv porne
Doug: This is the most beautiful 4-door ever! Ford Fusion drivers: 😐
It’s a cheap 2020 Ford falcon with leather
Doug has officially lost his mind. This sedan is unattractive. & the depreciation, is straight up hideous.
So it's just a slightly redesigned mish-mash of aston martins, for 3-5 times the cost? Rich people really are dumb
This car is so ugly. Rip Aston Martin
Most beautifull sedan? Really? Dude, whole modern Aston Martin lineup looks better than this. Not to mention ridiculous price. But you have your opinion and I have mine.
I'm just happy people can see through the bullshit. lol
I prefer The 70s Lagonda
This how mich he said lagonda 👇🏻
He should have roasted this harder
Most beautiful 4 door car? What is this man talking? This looks like a car I would draw when I was 4 years old. 😂
it looks twenty times cheaper, incredibly ugly:))
Wtf I wouldn’t even give this car an 8/10 for styling   Then again Doug likes the look of the 996, so 🤷🏻‍♂️
an american sees a moderate luxury euro car for first time:
I knew it--------------- AM logos on the engine ; )
A m8 bmw has More luxury and horse Power for a 1/10 of this Car , this World got. so sad , sad like my english but for real , humans starve to death and some guys have Nothing to and Buying this Car instead of Helping Even burning this Money would help More Than buying this Car and sec thing is i dont Know Why he is Hyping the Car but no Wonder he Looks like some one that Could worke in my Garden
This guy looks like a Gardener and is Telling us what is cool and what Not ? This bs Car is okay but the Price is cringe,,, Max i would Pay is 170k Max Max Max Max
💩This should’ve been the Emblem on the hood
I want this so bad.
Don't you think that the base design has been "stolen" from the Lamborghini Estoque concept car? https://images.app.goo.gl/4zD4MfHST7TQS45e7 https://images.app.goo.gl/94PXan6wPM25xgxg9 https://images.app.goo.gl/XbFmDJdFDszZaeMp9
Nothing special, if not the price.
There’s no way this is more luxurious than an S Class, let alone a Phantom. It’s a re-skinned Rapide at most.
Doug.... perché 1 milione????... She's too expensive!!!
Addan Ashraf : YOU WANT A FORD  P.O.S. FUSION and have bragging right with your (not to bright but way to rich friends), be my guest. The A.M. is not worth the ransom the manufacturer wants from you. Buy the Volkswagen BUGATTI and you may have a winner. Good luck LUSTING FOR "EX0TICS" nameplates those has-beens!!!
I came back just for the comments, not gonna lie
It's like a Ford Fusion, only askew..
2022 S class will beat the shit out of this car...
Nice car, but it’s at least 4X more expensive than it’s worth.
Lagonda Deez nuts
This makes a phantom look like the best bargain to ever exist
doug you spend a solid 3-4 mins telling us how the lights switch from a basic brake light to turn signal from DRL to turn signal like its a amazing rare feature.  you can get LED bulbs on amazon that make your break lights into turn signals and your DRLs into turn signals when activated for 20$ a pair all you do is connect them like a reguler bulb and they workl the same as this cars does i have them on my nissan altima lmao.  also this car is pure shit for its worth and nowhere near the best looking sedan its target audience the middle east loves to be wowed this has zero wow feature and more of a sleek quirky laid back flithy rich guy who also doesnt want to be all up in your face with a bright neon orange hyper car. its also depricated over 55% already and worth less than 580k now. car depreciated as much as my homes value in 3 years another 3 itll be a 300k car and 3 after that 100k forgotten about car that will be maintence nightmare by this stage and undrivable. my 2006 saab 93 had a fridge in it lmao .
$1m. I wanna see thu the roof in a very luxurious way
Ipads hanging of the seats looks like shit
That's an expensive Charger.
Lamborghini Estoque copy
Damn it looks like a clay model
All the leathers that make this car a luxury car doesn't cost more than $20000.
Seems like a total rip off.
Well, you get what you agree to pay for...
You cheated with door it wanted to close but you stopped it
Rear headroom bulge is for the owner's crown.
My 99 LS400 did 0 to 60 just ONLY 1.8 second slower than this and it's had Radar Cruises control for the JDM version.
no wonder they go bankrupt
If Inhad the money I would buy it, just to flex.
It looks like a Ford Focus
Does the Gemera not count as a sedan?
Lol for this money you could buy a really ratty original lagonda and restomod it into the 21st century and still probably have 500k leftover for shits and giggles
1m for a car with Honda Accord headlights and taillights w no sunroof?
I know everyone is hating on this car but putting everything aside, that exterior is absolutely beautiful.
Think of it as a Ford Fusion with heated back seats and more leather 😂
Front end looks like a Ford Fusion
9:51 Dougs hair
One million is a total rip off. So many details look really ghetto, starting with the iPads(!!!) in the back. They basically thought “Let’s just put leather everywhere and some idiots will be ok paying a million for dead cows”. I’ll take the two Phantoms instead, thank you.
so all the leather makes it look like a million dollar sedan? aston's definition for luxury is their leather interior design, all leather all brown, thats the impression for this car, what a lame move,  rich man knows they'll buy mercedez S class if they want a luxury sedan
Yeah I'm dying on this hill, I seriously love this car. Yes, I know it's overpriced but to me it's a work of art.
Look Like A Shitty Ford Mondeo
Looks like a Dodge Charger for 1 million
so Doug got paid a lot to hype this stupid car..........
This is not even "Crazy" in the Aston Martin family. The Aston Marin 77 One, is the worlds only car, that dosn't have a backside. Everything hidden inside, underneath, or just 100% out of view, is at the same spec's as what you can see. It's a see, feel and sence car. Just imagine, knoving that inside the side panels, the paint, Ahhm, laquer is of same standard, as outside.  Despite you will never be able to see it.  But you know that's how it is.
Too expensive for what it is for sure.
Lindo pero no mas lindo que otros
This is the worst way to spend a million
Cheap at half the price.
That’s a damn charger with a mink coat
Am i the only who is on love with this car ?
It literally looks like a Genesis and a Chevy Malibu fucked behind an Applebee’s dumpster
Taraf mean s side/part/end....
Yo anybody else catch him trying to stop the door from closing when trying to (poorly) show the door stops anywhere pfft like don't make up things the car can't do properly (I imagined Jeremy Clarkson saying in his snarky voice shaking his head "but they don't")
aston martin accord
Looks a lot like the Lamborgini Estoque  just not as beautiful
My 2006 750Li had 90 percent of these features.. I paid 15k for it
1 million dollars for what sir Aston: laughs and falls on the ground 😐
Taraf is opulence in Arabic yet with negative connotations
So I exchanged my $18K 2013 Honda Fit with NO sunroof for a $21K 2015 Honda Fit WITH a sunroof.... while the $1M Lagonda doesn't get one at all? :D
I'd rather buy a BMW X7 than this Aston Martin that has a front end from a Genesis.
Did he actually forget to open the middle screen or there isn't any? I'm confused Doug, enlight me...
Might as well sell my used bed for $500,000 because it’s the only bed used by me, therefor it’s worth money
I've recently driven S class (not sure which year but quite modern like 2018-2020) and it looked better, more attention to detail and probably more "luxurious" than this for fraction of the price.  Not to mention the "Rolls Royce problem" fully spect Phantom is much better than this
This ugly af car is a million dollars?? 🤣🤣  Id pay 2 million$ for a new Kia Optima before paying 25$ for this haha
That's a nice Accord!
Looks like the Ford Fusions younger yet wealthy af brother
Wow they dont even put in rear monitors or a powered trunk closer for a million dollars... this car is a ripoff
I guess beauty really is subjective, another good review though.
My version of reviewing modern cars:  “THISSS is a modern day shit box! It has be bombarded with safety standards making it look like total trash compared to older leaner cars. Some of the features include the high beltline, tiny windows, fat pillars, poor visibility, enormous amounts of weight and the boring automatic transmission that requires no skill to drive. Add the score up and….it gets a 0 out of 100 placing in the dumpster where it belongs.”   “And make sure to check out cars and bids where much cooler looking and fun to drive older cars are up for sale”
It looks like it got hit with an ugly stick. I'll admit though, the inside is nice. Now that i see it's not supposed to be an aston martin style car, I think it's not so bad.
I still prefer a Charger Hellcat redeye widebody 2021 , 800 hp , it's way beautiful and costs less than 10% of this lagarbage" "Lagarbage is for posers"
Reminds me of a Chevy impala
Looks like a Hyundai
تَرَف
The way this depreciates pretty soon we will see a video from Hoovies Garage... "I have bought the world cheapest Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf" lol
No wonder it was for sale. It looks nice, but cars at 1/4 the cost from the same model year have more features and amenities than this. Embarrassing.
The ratio of quirks to features is high with this one.
I would prefer a Maybach even if it was of same price as this.
I would never buy this , it's uglier then me
A well equipped S Class from the same year is better than this car. Such a poorly thought out thing considering the price. No wonder the Lagonda brand is dead.
Thisss is the 2018 Aston Martin Ripoff😁  Also a bit quirky with the umbrella,  if the intended market is the middle east. 😂
So could have bought a RR Phantom + Dawn set for the same price, but at least I get a 90‘s center console, 5 cows worth of leather, a door that still moves a little bit, and an umbrella
definitely not worth this much money, i would say that i could pay max 300 000 dollars for this car
Even the Mercedes Maybach is better than this and far cheaper than this, this car doest even have luxury lights at the back, it uses garman entertainment system lmao for $1 million dollars, will definitely not buying that car
i hope they release 120 more lagondas for mars
@13:44 plastic seatbelt buckles?  1/10 would not buy.  Should have been carbon fiber.
American owner paid over a million dollars gettin' this very rare car at 1/289500000 ratio in United States.
How would the performance of this compare to say, a 80s Lambo? Anyone?
25:09 The word you use is 'exclusivity'.  Rare?  This isn't a steak.
The grille design on every Lagonda differs from Astons, since it is a Lagonda.  It doesn't have the trad Aston grille shape on purpose.  A tradition inside a tradition.  Gotta love those Brits.
Matte color and these wheels makes look this car ugly. Check other Lagondas she's quite beautiful car.
Looks cheaper than $1 mil
Don’t get me wrong it’s nice but 1 million dollars is WAY overpriced. Should be more like one hundred thousand to one hundred-fifty thousand.
It's name sounds like a gay fart
It is nice looking but not 1 million dollars nice looking
1 million dollar car that looks like a Honda Accord
Doug : this is the most beautifulest car I have ever seen.  Car : looks like a ford
This Aston Martin is still not worth $1 million dollars to me. It is covered in the lap of authentic leather, among other things; however, the parts will be very expensive and rare to find, and, to me, the Rolls-Royce is well-known versus this vehicle.
Interior is shit. Merc-Maybach any day.
why is every aston martin interior trash?
This is hella ugly. A lot of better looking cars on the market for a LOT cheaper.
A better word for the rarity factor is exclusivity ;)
THIIIIIITTTTHHHH 🤷🏾‍♂️ IS THE …….😆
i think this car is beautiful. But the price makes it ugly
As someone who was raised in the 90's early 2000's this isn't too futuristic concept car to me lol this looks like something from grand theft auto. I wouldn't think this car was anymore than $150,000 no coolness no style
My neighbors have one! Impressive car
this looks like an elantra
Who is crazy enough to buy this shit
People in mercedes-benz must have laughed when they saw this car and the price tag.
Thats just a ghibli
Hello Doug, this time you have really excelled yourself trying to make an Ass a thoroughbred. Well done me lad. I shall continue after viewing the entire video. The telescopic cylinder at the door is a good idea, except that it shall be the first to go wrong with an unintentional hit in entering or exiting. I had used it in my Mini in 1971. It did not work.  11:46 ... Like we say in England about the Irish: They have the gift of the gab. You have it. 13:23 ... It is joing two pieces of leather asking it to be pulled apart soon by it use of being stretched ... 16:24 ... A person spending a million dollar does not do any of that ... He/she has someone else to perform: a Secretary. I am not in the league to fork out, however, I am reasonably affluent to have someone to do those chores. Every three months or so I drive to Sweden and to Turkey. I have a customized front passenger seat for such uses. I am a Brit through and through. Aston Martin was failure from the start. It is neither a luxury or a true sports like its rivals, the Italian Cats. It was a failure. it is a failure today.
Bruh. This car isn’t even worth it. It looks very boring. I prefer the rolls Royce than that. Btw this is my opinion, so don’t say $H!T towards me.
Why did they use te same brake rotors for the left and right ? In my opinion this looks totally weird, especially when you know that the curved slots on the right rotors should face the other way like in every other car wit slotted rotors.
Ah yes, VW Phaeton but 10 times more expensive
Wow, Aston interiors suck.
this looks like a volvo s90. Not that beautiful
17:02 "what they had"?! ... so where the 1milion went? into... "research"? Tablets were around for quite some time, and light diodes were invented in the early '70 (for all car makers bragging about using "led technology"). Maybe is the leather seats then... made from resurrected mammoths?
100k max
closning the back door sounded like a cheap bmw . If you close the door on a rolls royce you dont hear  metal ringing
Classic hype man. This car is not 1-miilion dollars worth of special or beautiful. People really do buy into the whole more expensive is better.
Yes, I agree that this car is beautiful certainly, and was disappointed to learn that there were no plans for the USA market (Federalization would have required how many sacrificed in crash tests?).  The matte black looks awful to me, but yeah, rather pipular with a certain crowd.  But watching the presentation, and listening to Doug, especially the repeated "Tah-RAFFFF" in a sarcastic tone reminds me of listening to some self-important high school biology teacher lecture.
This car is British Frankenstein . Put together with body parts from Mazda, Ford, Dodge, Jeep... riding on an ancient power platform that has given headaches to American owners and mechanics for decades.  (if the window and door opening switches go bad in this car-get replacement from a junk yard from a Grand Caravan mini van) If Aston Martin sold all of their Lagondas in N. America it would make 1 million dollars since there is only one car available. Therefore, there is no point analyzing financial aspects of this car.
A mil with an infotainment center like that... Wtf...
Also the ugliest
This has insanely shit tech for a 2018 car pathetic I'd pay 100k max for this , bmw 1 series has better tech , what a shocking car
This car was such a disappointment...
The Mercedes S class is killing this car in every department. Aston Martin think people are stupid
KIA Stinger is better than this
This is a big scam xD 2014 S500 Mercedes is better than this
Not sure why Doug thinks its so beautiful, it looks like a Cadillac.
Interior designer by Timberland.
Except the 2nd spot he put it - 10:02
A Toyota Avalon with that hideous Darth Vader grille is a nicer car. At least that has CarPlay.
Stupid car
At least it looks completely different from most Astons, which, to be fair, look very similar
No cooled seats in the back?  No massage?  No sunroof?  No temperatures on the climate controls?  My sister’s Honda Civic has a better center display.    Not worth a million bucks.  Not even close.
Gosh what a total shit hole waste of money. This is just Aston Martin being greedy. I’ve seen way better ‘luxury’ from a early 2000s Honda Accord
People in these comments don’t realize that whoever bought this car didn’t want something flashy and “LOOK AT ME”  like a Rolls or Bentley. The Lagonda is gorgeous yet discreet. If you can’t afford it, why complain about it👨🏼‍🦯🤘
also the front grill looks exactly like honda accord
Kind of looks like a Vantage and a Dodge Dart had a baby
assthin
Though the normal world has given it an unbelievable value it doesn’t seem look expensive. It’s a made up value & it depends on how we give value by our mind. It’s all inside us and not in this car.
This mans words hold no worth
Doug: “this is the best looking 4 door car ever “ Me looking at it: “meh... i like a 4 door hardtop 73 chevy impala better”  The keyhole in the drivers door, the $5 hydraulic arm under the door and the rear airvents so do not have a place in a car in this segment. No not impressed. If it was my money and if i was shopping in this segment then id buy a bentley brooklands coupe
it's a nice car, but it's not a million dollar car and the depreciation is probably going to be the absolute worst only being bested by a handful of computers. At this price, nobody is using this thing to haul their family around, they have nannies for that, I'd rather just have a 2 door supercar or something. People buy this kind of car to be hauled around in. For a million dollars you could buy a new rolls or a bentley and then send it off somewhere to have bulletproof paneling and glass installed, with the engine tweaked to handle the increased weight. And that's the thing, for the extra half mil,  What does this car have that they don't? Absolutely nothing., and even more horrendous depreciation.
I’ll keep this short. Totally not worth anything even close to a million dollar price tag. You wouldn’t be able to tell this car from a Hyundai Genesis Sedan because that’s literally what it looks like. Lol.
Aston Martin is the Harley Davidson of cars.
10:10 My 2011 panamera had this feature
One million and they can't even come up with a way to hide the door key insert smh but it a beautiful car tho
Imma take 4 Bentley for $1m
"it will stay exactly there " 10:02  door proceeds  to not stay exactly there
10:04 - exactly.....oh shit not there......
ugly ugly ugly this color this wheels looks so cheap..
I actually bought a super cool car yesterday, too bad that I live in sweden... but I just bought a Volvo P1800ES. only 8077 were ever made in 1972 and 1973. it is a dream come true and I really think you should try one out if you ever get the chance.
Haha, the interior is a vegan's worst nightmare
Rapid? Skoda Rapid?
Forget the lagonda i want the centenario
What an absolutely underwhelming car for the price.
Doesn't worth 1 million
Virgin Lagonda: - Has old iPads for rear passenger entertainment - Has same switch gear as a $30K Ford Focus - Shares rear climate controls with an Aston Martin 1/4 the price - Has 2006 Garmin centre console - Costs $1M  CHAD Rolls Royce: - Has custom, polished silver/aluminum knobs for climate controls - Takes 17 female cows to line the interior with leather - Has buttons on inside to close the door for you - Cushions your feet with the finest sheep's wool carpets - Painted coach lines done by hand on every model - Stores the umbrella in the actual door jam for your convenience - Can be purchased at any time and in any country - ONLY costs $500K
Even if I had a billion dollars I wouldn’t buy one for half off
Am I alone in thinking this car isn’t that great looking?
314 km/h :-)
🤣😅🤣😂 1 Million $ Seriously I like it's look very simple very cool it's really eye catching. Maybe it's expensive but it's perfect for family and luxury and it's very collective too. 👍 But today it's available for 720000$
This car is... ugly... honestly... it does not say 1 mil... no way
I'd rather buy a Rolls Royce...or two. 🚘
Aston mart' innnn...
Doug assuming my financial status. I’m offended.
This car doesn’t look no better than a Hyundai.🙄
So 1 million dollars for a prettier, rarer and kinda better wrapped rapide?  For that money you'll for sure get a totally decked out Phantom which has been purposely built for luxury for the past 2 decades.
Wow, that was the most unenthusiastic "THIS" Doug has ever done
Sure you could buy one of these ….or you could get two much nicer  Rolls Royce Cullinan black badges and still have 50k left over
And then came the Rolls Royce Boat Tail.
Nice car, but it’s a perfect example of the law of diminishing returns. There is no way it is worth nearly ten times the price of a Mercedes-Benz  S-Class or a BMW 7 series.
For people with more money than Brain cells. It is a nice car but I don't see anything that even remotely justifies the price.
Looks like an impala.
Breathtakingly beautiful? Jesus you’re a dweeb.
this cars trash lol if it doesn't resell for 100k and lose 90% of its value I wouldn't be surprised
How many airbags
I don’t think James Bond would pay that much for this..like he would have one sure..but
So what do you think Doug, was this for the Middle East because only Arab Sheiks could afford it, or only Arab Sheiks were fool enough to buy it?
Well, well. It seems this is an ego-vehicle for those with more dollars than sense. The late Lincoln Continental has comparable or better equipment, comfort and luxury-wise features (and clever Ford-patented goodies) One could purchase a fleet of 8 exclusive Continental coach-door sedans. Nice, the Taraf certainly is. Exclusive and exquisite? Oui, oui. Worth the price? One mustn't be silly, now, must one?
the front end of this straight up looks like the new accord front end
The most beautiful 4 door car of all time ??? ......nope...
Doug- at 19 mins you remind us that this car’s tachometer is in KMS because “it was never intended to be sold in North America”. You forgot that almost all countries in North America use metric system not imperial system....your comment should’ve read in USA instead.
1 million dollars but looks like a Ford Mondeo from the front
Only a stupid will spend 1million dollars for this piece of sh*t.being exclusive is not an excuse for being overpriced.its outright robbery.
looks like an accord with a long hood
review the karlmann king!
i love how Doug goes on about old instrument gauge clusters with "crappy" low res displays that are 20 years old but never said anything about the screen this car has and not to mention the climate control screen, a 2007 fiat grande punto has a clearer climate control screen than this overpriced garbage 😂 but honestly, the car is beautiful from the outside
An S-class is a bargain compared to a Bentley which is a bargain compared to a Rolls royce which is a bargain compared to a Lagonda
I want to ask someone who owns this the old joke...  Me: is your refrigerator running?  Them: yeah.  Me: well you better go catch it!
Besides the leather, it's so cheap looking inside, the switches and everything ....how do people want this for that price
This thing sucks. Aston Martin laughed all the way to the bank every time some poor (rich) sucker paid a million dollars for one. How many million dollar cars barely even turn the heads of normal, non-car people? Probably just this one.
Toyota has a more luxurious nav than this
There is absolutely nothing beautiful about this long ass Hyundai G80 and Jaguar dwarf child
Looks like a business shoe
Someone with ‘exquisite taste?’ So only seriously wealthy people have exquisite taste?
Expensive but it's an overpriced Aston Martin parts bin. A Rolls-Royce may start at 500k and optionable to however much you want it to cost, but to get it to 1 mil, it's all bespoke, made specially for your car.
11:09 Yeah so does my 2005 Pathfinder LE, whose luxury features are better speakers and heated fake leather seats.
Very expensive.  - Mr. Dink
If it was never available in the US, then how is it there when in 2021 its only 6 years old.
shit.....
Name one thing that this car is better than S63 JUST ONE THING for like 750000-800000 $ less
The one thing I absolutely love is that semi-gloss piano black paint color. I think I could probably have any car painted with that color and finish for a lot less than $1 million, though.
70k car priced 1mio.
To people ‘complaining’ Phantoms & Mulsannes are better yada yada — 120 owners of Lagonda Taraf already have those sitting in their garage.
this doesnt even come with pillows in the backseats and its 1 million dollars
I think i click the wrong Quentin Tarantino.... but i like it anyway
Fake it’s a Ford Fusion 😂
Im just laughing at how everyone in the comments understand how NOT special this car is yet Doug is emphasising how special it is.
Why does grille look like its saying mr potter ?🤣
This makes the Rolls Royce cheaper!
A million price tag and they just nonchalantly threw an ugly boxy PC  power unit in the trunk. FFS, couldnt they at least designed the freakin box with mat tones and design that is more pleasing. Its like finishing a beautiful building and then puttin on the front an wooden halfpainted doors.
Damn gotta hit up the Goodwill for some Daddy Doug Drip
Definitely NOT the most beautiful 4 door..so many many others..dusenberg..merc, rolls..etc
Can you find a Mazerati Quattroporte 2009-2010
Did not quite catch it how much is this car?
looks weird
The ultimate Middle East Wank Mobile
this is the most weirdest and ugliest design i have ever seen  it's like that they are trying to make it as a Nascar Racing car  but it's not even close
A Cadillac ct6 has screens in the back and this doesn’t :D
Extremely overpriced for what it offers
The buyer probably pays an extra 10 grand for that ashtray, it looks like a tin can with Lagonda written on it
The front grill and headlights remind me of something Audi would make
It would look way better with glossy paint and better looking wheels(not this cheap looking sh**)
This doesn’t look like it’s worth no where near 1 million
This car sucks, it's so expensive and it doesn't even have good luxury

ABC’s of SALVATION  ADMIT: You’re a sinner, condemned to DEATH (physical & spiritual) .  Romans 3:10, 23 There is none righteous, no, not one … For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  Romans 6:23 & James 1:15 the wages of sin is death … sin, when it is finished bringeth forth death. (Spiritual death is eternity in HELL !)  BELIEVE: that JESUS died, rose again, and that HE ALONE can save you from sin, death, and hell.  Romans 10:9-10 if you: believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness.  CONFESS: JESUS CHRIST, and nothing else, as your own Saviour. Romans 10:9, 10 & 13 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus … confession is made unto salvation … whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  Before it’s too late, forever, DO IT NOW! God’s gift is FREE and as easy as A-B-C !
How many cow’s Can you stuff in a L A G O N D A..?
navi looks like 15years older gen....
Honestly doesn't look that good😐
Thats not overpricing anymore, this got to be a scam.
24:47: "you're not paying for..." changes sentence cause there's no other way to finish this sentence in a positive light.
Nothing, not a single damn thing, that you mention or show in the video makes this worth even close to $1mm. It's not "limited" to the middle east, it's BANISHED to that region cause no where else can you find people who would buy this.
It's somewhat astonishing that the most expensive brand new sedan is, what, 70 or 80 times more expensive than the cheapest brand new sedan (in the US, that is), whereas if we take, say, wristwatches, then the most expensive one will probably be hundreds of thousands of times more expensive than the cheapest one. One million dollar watch models are not that rare. There's no wonder there are people in the world who have their cars custom built by these ultra luxury companies to make their prices more in sync with their million dollar watch :///
Zvuk zatvaranja zadnjih vrata kao na Dačiji Logan. A kao luksuzni sedan.
May aswell save ur money and buy the 7 series version with the BMW badge 😂😂
there is NO hand stiched lether in cars, there is machine cut lether and stiched in special sewing machins , the " hand stiched" thing is a marketing lie, i worked in the company that makes this as a sewing machine mechanic , i should know
Not much to write home about.
Hey man, I see you doing great work and coverings but I noticed an important element missing in your videos which is taking videos of the cars you review from outside while you drive it from different angles so we can see how the car looks when it’s on the road you can use a drone FPV pilot to do the videos for you  you’ll enjoy the outcome along with us. I hope you find my message beneficial because you bring great cars and reviews
There so many vastly superior vehicles at a fraction of the price; it's a badge of stupidity.
* monkey conference meme* : where cooled seats?
i looks nice, BUT ....is worth probably 110.000
give me a BMW 7Li and a very nice house for that money
Not impressed one bit
Vehicle for someone who has too much money. Seems way over-priced.
28:10 maybe it's different in person, but I'm not seeing a 10 on video. Maybe it's the "standard" wheels.
Beautiful looking car but the interior is a 3 at best.
I saw one on the road in 2018. It was a British market right hand drive version too. The side profile is kind of reminiscent of the 70's Lagonda.
Any machinery made in Britain is pervertly twisted. JCB is probably the only exception. Probably :)
Does not look like a million dollars car.
that is a 300k car lol not a mil
wat een schoonheid.
Meh
This car is kinda ugly really. And way too expensive.
I trully love AM but this car is just a failure
Being from the Middle East these cars are made for  the elf’s of corrupt tyrants who thrives on stolen money.
Look like an up-bagged Jaguar XJ
why did he not kill this car the comments agree
Ugly ass car
1 million dollar turd
Why is Aston Martin so damn quiet lately
Aston Martin to doug: sell this sedan we will give you 50/50.
.....1M for a luxury sedan with a flat paint job? Nah.
This like the Maserati of rich people
I have a Buick anclave 2008
This car is nice, at best 150k nice. In terms of luxury, looks and performance, i would say it competes with a Quattroporte . Not  a dollar more than that .(it is essentially a less outrageous looking rapid lmao)
The new Genesis G80 looks way better from the outside.Also it’s 10 times less expensive
AAANNNNDDDDDD... youre friggin crazy. This is the ugliest thing aston's ever made.
who ordered the awful "i wanna be batman" paint?!
Luxury Arabian car is the Taraf
Complete junk! My Chevy cavalier will run circles around that piece of shit!🤣
1:28 that's one scratched up bumper right there O.o
I love the sound of saying “Lagonda logo”
10:03 😂
So it is a Ford Taurus? 7:45
It seems to me ridiculously overprized. Not only it isn't twice as good as a Phantom, it's not even as good as a Phantom.
Taraf means sumptuousness, opulence.
That small infotainment screen that looks like aftermarket and that dot matrix gauge cluster and climate control screen makes this car look very outdated and cheap. This car looks like a $200k car. But I like the design and its rare but not worth the hefty price tag.
No mention of the ridiculous key holes on the front doors come on Doug ⁉️ Definitely not worth a million bucks IMHO and anyway I don't have this million. But if... I would choose Bentley, Rolls-Royce or Maybach.
Who else thinks it looks likes a ford falcon fgx in the front
The ugliest expensive car I’ve ever seen
I feel like I've seen better features in the new Kia Carnival minivan!
1mil and you don't even get a moon roof
This car is not worth 150.000$ 🤣
It looks like a Ford Fusion....
Did a 12 year old pick the matte black paint?
Million dollar car but “Doug” gave it a 66 so I better not buy it lol
Freakin cheap Ford turn signal? On a million dollar car?  What a piece of shit
So your telling me... that I could get either a Lagonda Taraf   OR   an exotic supercar and a nice house...  I think the decision is pretty obvious      Obviously an exotic supercar + a house
While it lacks in features, it is absolutely beautiful.  I can't comprehend how anyone could think it's ugly.
cant even come close to a godamn RRoyce, or Bentley, 1 million my ass.
Agree with the styling ... holy sh!t ... it's subtley gorgeous ... I'm not even an Aston fan.
Aston Martin Challenger
It dosent look good at all  It looks like a normal car finished in matt black rolls royce is far more better
A totally uninspiring looking car, that Doug gushes and swoons over. If I spent one million dollars I'd like it to at least look attractive and special!!!
I have a question isn’t Aston already a luxury brand
This kinda reminds me of that ocelot car in gta v
All things considered, I'm underwhelmed...  Doug calls it "beautiful".  To each his/her own.  I think it's just ok, nothing more.  Not that it matters anyway as I certainly won't be in the market for one.
Better looking than the E38 750 BMW? What are you smoking? Lol
That damn car is no way worth a million dollar !
Bro the front is literally a Honda Accord
The weakness of this car is 1 millions dollars.
It actually looks like a mazda
Is this a cool car? Yes. Is this worth a million dollars? Damn no.
Hey did anyone else notice the logo said Lagonda and not Aston Martin? Really wish Doug would have mentioned that
love you Doug but this car looks generic AF. I don't understand why you're so into this one.
You never let the viewer hear the engine startup from any of the video's I have watched  ... epic fail
A tachometer in any automatic is so dumb but takes stupidity to a new level in a million dollar automatic
Looks like a car from GTAV, generic and boring and that matt paint does everything to blend that "excellent" design you are sperging over Doug. What about those silver keyholes??? Ford stocks??? Garmin navi? You should slam this car so hard and laugh at it like you did with the Volga, but yeah that was Russian so haha funny, this on the other hand is an Aston and very expensive so no haha no funny? Get a grip man.
Looks like a Chrysler..
Whoever would get this over a phantom has a small brain
Single clutch transmission in a $1M car, but at least those seat belt clips are wrapped in plastic!
This car is rubbish it's better I buy a rolla royce and a G wagon
tourath means heritage in arabic, where tf are u getting these translations ?
Doug is the kind of guy to compare a ford Taurus to the laganda.
Doug: Distinctive front grill, etc...  Any new Mazda: Hi.
Rolls Royce Phantom or even Mercedes Maybach S Class is much much better than this car!
It’s funny he made the Ford Taurus name comparison. From the start of the video I am thinking to myself “I have seen this front before” FORD TAURUS
The door handles are flush! and it is not Astin its Aston
Here's a list of att all the "pure luxury" things you get with this car: -Skimpy external hydraulic 10:16 -Visiable self-tapping screw on dashboard 16:29  -Garmin infotainment system (and no touch screens of anything) -A lot of cheap looking plastic in center area 15:12 17:38 -21:26 Come on that looks a bit.. amateur
Verrey nice interea but a bit basic four the price your paying nice looking car though
Bruh, this car isn’t worth 1m. Aston Martin tripping!
These cars are ridiculously priced. Cars shouldn’t be solely priced based off a few designs and the rarity or the car. Most Mercedes maybach variations don’t even surpass 400k with all options added and it’s ultra luxury but Aston Martin to price this at 1 million dollars when their company is the Maserati of luxury
Yes, it is gorgeous.  It also needs to be a foot longer to even approach the rear cabin comfort of my Maybach.
The front looks like the front of my Ford Taurus’s grill and headlights
Aston: most expensive lux sedan. Koenigsegg: hold my beer.
AM really havent improved their rep with this car
That car needs to have 600.000 in cash in the trunk to worth 1.000.000
How to waste my 1m$ money   Aston Martins: the lagonda
Ew. $900k for Leather everything
2021 Hyundai Elantra front grille
when you got more money then  brains
Eh rolls Royce phantom looks nicer
@10:16 come on a million dollars and they stick a skimpy external hydraulic at the base of the door? there are much more elegant engineering solutions...and it doesn't matter how much stitching there is...i see only a stretched Rapide
Manny koshbin should cop one lmao
Wouldn’t even think twice about take a phantom over this
How can this car be 1 million USD? You showed us a generic GTA car with some nice outside detail and premium letter stitching and basically, that's it.  A Mercedes would cost less, be as luxury, and a better engine, better maintainability. For that amount of money, I was expecting some car from the future or diamond rims, etc...  If this video was an honest review of a product I must say you're not very objective.
The fridge cooling buttons are from a Mercedes and they don’t even have power seats for the rear and no cooled rear seats for 1mil Edit- It doesn’t even have a power trunk
Built in 2015-2016 and it doesn't have any touch screens? What? A $30,000 jeep cherokee in 2015 has a touch screen.
I’m sorry but it’s shhhhhhit
This is the most stupid point for that much money and it’s ugly design
My comment is to those who tell that this is a moderate car with less features, then boy you shouldn't love sports cars like Shelby gts and others like that with less features If u love them for their sportiness and design Love this also as this was the best luxury offered in those times
This really is unequivocally the most beautiful sedan made in the past 50 years at least. It is stunningly gorgeous, both inside and out. If I became a billionaire today (by some total miracle), I wouldn't go out and buy a bunch of hyper-expensive cars (although I would buy a Porsche 959 or a 1990s 911 Speedster, an EV sedan, and a brand-new Tesla Roadster), but I would definitely go out of my way to pick one of these up to drive on VERY rare occasions. I wonder if Aston Martin will ever decide to bring back the Lagonda name to make ultra-luxury sedans, perhaps EVs? Maybe this is secretly a concept car🤞
Pretty ugly car.
Pathetic 🚘
Imagine speccing a $1M car in FLAT BLACK...  This thing needs some appropriate deep metallic paint, preferably in a Good Color.
Where are the massage seats?
The biggest rip-off in recent history.
"sheer beauty" - veeeery subjective :D
The most ugly car
Doug please review the GTR50 someday!! 🙏🙏🙏
Just imagine the review if this overpriced car was a ...maserati 😂😂 Everything would be a problem. Even the name.
The only good thing about this is that fact it's not going to be sold
that shape is so ugly, not appealing at all, RR ghost or phantom wayyy better than this in looks, 1 million? thats why these companys go broke.
Came back to say I'd rather drive a real Accord, just people knowing I'd be stupid enough to pay a million for this is insulting
I'd buy a Dodge Charger and pocket the rest of the money.
i'd say it looks like a ford mondeo(europe version)..
Overpriced as fuck, but damn that colour is sexy af
maybach w240 takes the cake big time
You would think that at that price, you’d get tinted windows.
Doug... How can you own a ford GT and say that this average sedan looks better 😑
2009 tech sold in 2018 for much more money than 2018 tech.
This isn't worth the money If I'm being honest
What do i get for my million? Yes. But not really.
Ashtray in a leather wrapped $1M interior. Huh?
A Tesla has self closing doors and costs at least 1,000,000 less
I’m not spending a million dollars for a car with iPads.
distinctive
The window with snow weather is a no no 👀
That car is stunning.  I love how it looks. The paint and the lines and the sexiness... love it.
Wow Chrysler really stepped it’s game up
Is it me or does it reminds me of a 2020 honda accord
the only thing I dont like is the fact that the grill look like an Audi
That thing is hard to look at
its look like 2007 car(interior design)
I think Doug got a "deal he can not refused" -kind of thing
Mercedes Maybach S600 has a lot of more to offer for 1/5 of this value.
Lagonda Taraf sounds like a meal I order in a resteraunt I can`t afford and tastes a bit funny if you are honest about it.   "How is your Lagonda Taraf honey? :D"   "Deeeelicious (omg help OO)!"
Review toyota avanza
Luv your vid
will you be able to help ship the car if i buy @ carsNandbids??..🇵🇭🇵🇭
Looking like a honda accord
How much did they pay you Doug....
Nothing to look at here but the price.
A little Quattroporte in style. I guess they still make those in 2021. (Ahh..Maserati)  The value should be higher because of rarity. You can sell it on about 10 years for the same or more perhaps.
A bad copy of a Maybach 57 with a higher price tag.
It looks like the Chevalier Fugitive from GTA 5
This car sucks, and 1mill?? Are you kidding me? Look's so cheap inside, the leather is nice but that's it.... Rolls roys is so much better, more luxurious, more style, way better engine. But this car looks cheap and sad, the price is absurd.
Literally new Flying spur is so much nicer than this
Question:  Why is this car twice the price of rolls Royce when it's not nearly as luxurious? No umbrella, no champagne glasses, etc.
"Aston Martin of this era..."  *Car is only 3 years old.
One of the ugliest cars I've ever seen
10:25 A fiat 500 doors shut nicer than this 😳
It’s barely any better than a Honda Accord
Hey Doug, how is going? Do you know there is a brazilian called Lucas Torres of the channel "Carro Chefe" doing videos exactly like yours? Is not similar, is igual. The way you start and the way you show the car. He is a grand plagious of you.
Front looks like a Honda Accord
Imagine buying this over a brand new Rolls-Royce and a 2021 Audi RS8 Mansory and a house in England
so you are telling me a million dollar car doesn't even have tv screens in the back, they are just mounted iPads
That car is absolutely gorgeous. My god. THIS is a bond car
If your even feeling down and you drive a Ford Focus, just remember that your car has the same turn signal stock as a 1 million dollar luxury sedan.
Only I see a hyped Ford Fusion I guess.
Lagonda tariff
i got it the link and i will sell the Aston car and  i will by Bmw i8 car
It's nice, but all the luxury stuff could be had in a rapide or even a v8 vantage from this time, including the leather headliner. Definitely not worth a million dollars.
Aston made an incredible business decision. If all of these are sold, that's an extra $100 Million or so in pure profit. Considering the car is trash, this was definitely all about the money.
Taraf in Arabic means too luxurious .
Aston Martin-Lagonda decided to ptoduce a limited series of 120 cars with cheap mass ptoduction Ford parts at cost of less than 200k US dollars on sky high selling price which isn't worth the money you spend on that vehicle. But as there are people who are blinded by marketing and "exclusivity" the same would buy right away even a gold plated or beautiful leather stitched piece of shit!
If my car hits this car. Than the value of my car goes up. . . If I had a car.
Haha 1 mln
The back reminds me of the nighthawk from burnout paradise
It looks like Dacia 1300
“as a lot of cars from this era did!.”  Dude, its a year and a half old.
its a joke that this shit costs 1mill dollar. the quality is a joke for this price
$1,000,000 and the engineer who designed the drink chiller in the trunk clearly didn’t think that people may use the truck for storing things. Like wtf
This is the dumbest car you can purchase. Why wouldn’t you get a rolls lmao
This car is worth 1 million USD only if you put 750,000 in the trunk in cash.
It's an overpriced car to take idiots money. It really tells you a lot about chracter of the company.Aston knows what its about,they are perfectly fine  with screwing up people.Seriously they engineered this car to steal money.Whata great company.
Only 120 of these were built so expect them to hold their value
wtf I never heard the word Taraf even though I’m Arabian
Remember kids: just because something‘s expensive, it‘s not automatically valuable!
front looks like a ford fusion
so if you sum up... it's a pretty shitty car.
You can buy 25 Lexus sedans with that much money
Paid advertisement. Probably sale wasnt going as expected. I wonder why...
More like Aston Martin Scam
Not worth a million dollars I’ll take any Royce 😂😂
*Therapist:* "Tiny Doug isn't real. It can not hurt you!" *Tiny Doug:* 3:27
It would be a great car.... In 2004..... For 85k dollars
Beautiful? Gorgeous? Absolutely nothing special on its look!
You actually can drive it without having a million dollars. If you know someone who owns a Lagonda, and he lets you borrow it, you're all set.
I do not see how and why this could be "the most beautiful sedan ever made" ,  to me it's just good looking car and no way I would guess that its price tag is over 200K $
this guy just focus on the same things over and over again, repetition on the same boring shit
I’d call this striking, intimidating, imposing. I don’t think I’d call it beautiful though 🤔
Its not beautiful
Loganda zirraff
Headlight looks like kia sonata
This is ugly from behind
Headlight copied from honda accord old model
1 million dollar car with a front that looks like a Mazda 3, a rear from a Dodge Challenger, an interior from a 2006 Aston Martin vantage, and tech that I could find in a Honda Accord, which looks better than this thing
That's one ugly car... I've never disagreed with Doug more on something than his feeling on the esthetics of this car.
Bentley is best
That car is fucking pathetic.
It looks like an impala
U must be stupid rich to buy this for a million.
That thing looks basic af old 2000s sedan lookin thing
What an absolute joke of a car, the exposed keyhole on the driver’s door, the exposed piston that’s just bolted on the bottom of the door, the CHEAPEST ashtray ever made, the awful monochrome leather interior and a fucking ipad bracket on the back seat? The guys at aston martin probably know that rich sandpeople have no taste at all and if you just tell them that it’s expensive they’ll buy it just to say their car was 1 million
I would pay $70k for it
Same grill as a ford explorer
This is so ugly
This looks incredibly unremarkable, kinda like a less pretty Panamera, but the Panamera is made by a manufacturer that's known for reliability.
we live in a world where the ultra rich would buy this not because it is better than a rolls royce but just for bragging rights for the fact that it is more expensive and exclusive...
it looks like a ford fusion
28:03 Doug score
I am sorry but this car is ugly. It has a very odd looking shape to it and the side vents are too large. They make the car feel dated even though its fairly newish.
Several cows were harmed to produce this stupid car's roof
The turn signal at the back and the door thingy really isn't anything special...why even bother review those things
Damn that rear is the worst looking part to me
The wheels look aftermarket and the styling looks unfinished, bad effort by Aston who usually design beautifull cars.
Do you need heated seats in the Middle East? :9
That European Challenger is dope.
So my 28k Passat has "device" mounts ... I guess i'll sell it for a mil? Anyone? Anyone? Man, for 1mil, I'd get a retired state Benz that is bullet proof and have a paid driver for 10 years. Lovely car, don't get me wrong, but totally underwhelming for a price. Also, that front grill is just fugly in my opinion (which does not matter that much tbh lol)
Million dollar car has CD player!
I'm just stuck on why a $1,000,000 car doesn't have automatic retractable door handles.
Looks like a Hyundai Genesis... complete with "Genesis" being the brand name
It resembles a 4 doors Dodge Challenger.
This looks like a realistic version of quartz regalia
I love cars so much, I would probably do shit like this too if I was a billionaire... But for us plebeians, Good God does this video sum up how much some people live on different planets.
Aaaa... yah it is so beautiful but yet.. not worth a million dollars ... for that kind of money you can get custom built phantom and will still be less than a million!! ..
I truly don't understand how this car is double the price of a Rolls. You don't even get as much power or features/luxury options that you do in a Rolls. How tf is this a million $
It's not worth a million......  yet.
Doug got it wrong. Everyone in the comment section agrees the irrespectively of the price we all prefer the Rolls-Royce. This is not luxurious or even good looking enough to be a competitor. If someone buys this to stick it to the owners of Rolls-Royces they're only fooling themselves
You THISSS has separate fanbase😂
I don’t see the beauty. It’s basically what an American muscle car looks like.
I can't figure out why would someone buy one for one million...
nice Hyundai you got there
Why have heated seats in the middle east ? 🤔
it looks like a 30,000$ ford sedan
lmao wouldn't even fork up 100k for this junk, RR all the way not even a comparison.
For those who find this video, as of today 2/20/21, there is a Taraf for sale for $590,000, over 41% depreciation in a little Over a few years
What if Doug was just making fun of this shit while not making Aston Martin executives feel bad?
I can't believe that doug tried to hype this car... No matter how ''exclusive'' it is; it's just an ugly, overpriced car that Aston Martin tried to use it's brand name to sell.
HONDA ACCORD
Wait.. it's got a "KM/Hr" speedometer and yet is a Left Hand Drive???
Please tell me that this is a joke.
It looks like Toyota corolla at front
On a late evening, you stumble, drop this key and it cracks: And now you, who dropped that key fob, now up to your PERSONAL concierge at Aston Martin. WHAT THE HECK? HOW MUCH DO THEY WANT FOR THAT REPLACEMENT?  AND HOW MUCH FOR THAT (connecting this new fob to my $1 million car) SERVICE? REALLY, I CAN BUY A  BRAND NEW 2021 HYUNDAI SONATA FOR THAT MUCH, you are joking right????
Maybe its just me but it is ugly....
Please Google "70's leather shoes" ... You'll get it...
Worst car to buy in 1 million 😕
$1M and this what you get 😂. Nothing I see is worth the price🤦🏿‍♂️. This is an insult to Rolls Royce, Bentley, Mercedes, BMW hell even Cadillac with this price tag.
Yeah I think these high end car manufacturers know there audience these companies used to make cars for the deserning business man now they just make cars for Saudis with more money than sense it seems like a dick waving contest to me why don't they don't spend some money perfecting penis enlargement surgery. I mean could you imagine the money they would save c'mon people a million quid it better come with wings and a pilot.
16:29 Self-tapping screw in the car for 1 million dollars.  Doug, is it normal that a self-tapping screw is screwed into the car's dashboard?
Doug.. do they not make windows out of swarvsky or some kind of crystal? Can they make Safety Crystal? Doug. DOUG!! DOUg!!!! dOUg!!! Can’t they fit super rich cars with crystal or diamondy or colored window?!?
I literally saw one fo these in a garage in London and I didn't even know what it was
I think the circle shapes running down the seats are supposed to ape the appearance of Oxford brogues, old chap.
No infotainment, tray tables, massage seats, auto closing doors, umbrella in door, starlight headline, customisable dashboard, 360• cameras, window curtains, rolls royce engine, spirit of ecstasy.  I’d take the rolls lol
U can only buy a audi for this money in india
A full of shit review like this takes so much credit from this guy.... Even though we all know he holds his shirt up to pee like, Butters from South Park 😂
A Lincoln has an electric close trunk 🤙🤙🤙🤙😂😂😂😂
It’s fuckin ugly! 😂 I want to like it but I don’t ...lol
rolls royce must be jealous n will double up their prices
Definitely bad  value
Culmea lăutarilor,,,,,,să apari la nuntă cu o mașină numită "TARAF" 😀😀
You were putting your hand to behind the door when it goes very near to close
Rip off...
I don't care how expensive this car is, MAKE MORE.
(Dacia) Logan'da in retro cadilacs edge design 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
A million for a car made from mostly a parts bin that spans 10+ years? Nah.....
Can you please, wear something nicer when you review fancy cars 😄
Gave the car a thumbs down not Doug DeMuro.
A Garmin's navigation system???🤣🤣🤣
25:17 umm, I am Saudi, living in Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦
To sum it up, the million dollar is for the brogues.
This is a beautiful looking car for sure but 400k max
Honestly ugly exterior
Bruh...dis ugly AF.
You have to be really really rich and/or stupid to buy this.
I think this car is outdated already.  A Ford Fusion has more features.
Seems like you're only paying for the rareness of this car. Nothing is really too special about it.
Absolute rip off
What is Laganda ? It's more fancy way to say Lada.
You're probably wrong about the badge on the motor. It's usual that it says who built it and not the final inspector.
If I win big jackpot at the lottery, well... Now I know how I'll spend some of my money...
This Car is rare. But its not an absolute Luxury Car. More in the class of an Maserati. 1 Million is a joke for that Car. 🤭
It has a Ford Engine
From the side, it looks ugly...
you know what Taraf means? Chief, chief of over-priced!
i rather buy a yacht for this amount of money
"Lagonda Turaf"? I think a Uganda giraffe will depreciate less than this thing.
I'd take an S-Class and an Audi S8 and the 700k left over.
This is most beautiful car i have ever seen, but let us be frank, it's no way it can justify its price tag.
My bmw M760 xdrive is better lol....
Could buy the entire fleet of functioning VW Phaetons for this price and give luxury AND LUDICROUS DISPLACEMENT to the People!
Nah I'll stick with my 2006 Caddy and get a used Lexus later that car ain't worth a third of what their asking!
A mercedes S klasse  is more more amazing like this,this car have a long way to cache S klasse
a mercedes e class is more luxurious than this lagonda
That's an ugly ass car!
Ford Fusion limo
Me: Start of Video: WTF is the comments section on about. This car is sexy Interior Review: Oh no... Media System: Oh Jesus... Gauge Review: Ah make it stop!!!  Aston Martin needs to stop cheaping out on interior design. They have such a distinctive style. I love the whole key in the center dash thing, I could even live with the big shifter buttons but that shitty 2-line LCD display in a million-dollar car, ew stop. I hate Rolls-Royce with a passion (too chromey) but there's way more value in a Phantom for sure.
You had the best review to this car, Very informative , Great job...👍🏻
The insurance must be a video in itself 😂😂😂
Looks like an ugly elongated mashup of a Ford Fusion/Taurus and an Accord. Why would you ever spend a million on this?
I missed the part of the video where the car was beautiful
They only sold 41.  That’s it.  Google it.
I’m on the Ogara Coach website right now,  and they are loaded,  literally loaded with the,   “Bentley—Bentayga.”   From 2017 on up.  A total of 11!!  Which considered loaded by any high end brand car dealership.  Regardless if it’s an Aston Martin or a Bentley dealership it’s self.    This should tell you for them to have this many Bentleys  of this model,  its definitely not a good vehicle.     When it’s stacked up against your other high end brands/model SUV . By,   Rolls Royce,  Porsche, BMW, MERCEDES , MASERATI, Lamborghini. You will not find these automobile manufacturers SUV on any,   Any other high end dealership lot in our Nation with this many used models of there 1 and only model they produce.
Is it a Leganda?
People who can not afford hating in the comments
Doug youre high as fuck its a goddamn Accord Sport
Imagine paying a million for a glorified Ford Fusion
Am i the only one who watches Doug's videos at 2x speed?
No No No this car is not worth a million dollar
Overpriced and underdelivered. No idea why this is scored that high.
Looks like a Dodge Charger to me
Can the Ghibli?
It probably cost Aston Martin 50 grand to make it...
i would rather buy a prius
That's an expensive parts bin project. You can buy several rapides for that kind of money. It's almost the same car just sportier.
I've always thought the original anteater was one of the most beautiful cars ever as well
I would pay $350,000 for it
i would rather buy ten C class benz instead of this in 1 million$
Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf
That’s the ugliest car I’ve ever seen in my life.
For a car that is 1 million dollars it looks basic in my opinion, honestly
10/10 styling? I don’t think so...looks incredibly mundane to be a 10. Especially the back end. Ain’t nobody gonna be breaking necks with this.
10:03 exactly there he said lol
21:30 looks like an aftermarket diy
Big deal... If you like this look so much, just buy a Mazda 3 sedan for the fraction of the price.
an S7 si sooo much better at 40k better than one million 😂😂😂😂😂😂
That's one expensive Ford
This is the first time I've heard of Lagonda,  whaaaaat. ....
That’s an ugly ass car.
Bias review tbh Doug, If I was a millionaire I’d defo buy two brand new rolls royces at the same price over a car which borrows its turn signal stock from a Ford, poor leather roof lining done too I can see it crumble
It looks like an elongated ford falcon in matte colour
$1MILLION for this piece of junk? Yes I said junk, because if they think it's worth $1 Million...not even close.
I'm not sure it's a 10 in looks, but it's definitely prettier than any Rolls.
A 2016 7 series is way over this car in EVERY perspective.
Stop saying *Lagonda Taraf* every time. It sounds so annoying.
Am I the only who thinks this car really isn’t that nice? 😂
Cool hundai genesis
Aston Martin : we need to make money profits are down I know we will take a rapide change the front and the back end give it a stupid name and sell in in the Middle East were there’s more money than sense.
One needs to be so rich that you are bored of a Rolls Royce and just looking to burn $1 Million.
Not really impressive for the price.
The exterior looks so common like any other car on the road,not worth all that money,somebody must have paid Doug to hype it
Yooooo that stereo is dope !! I love the speaker rising 💯
Looks like Honda Accord
Dude. Check out super car blondies seraph review. She has word for word used your review in hers. !!!
I really wonder who would buy this, and honestly, I don't find it to be that beautiful...
This is an overly priced ugly sedan.
Hey Doug, if I recall when it first came out one of the main reasons it cost so much was the the whole body was carbon fiber and it was one of the first cars to have that. There is a YouTube video that mentions it, I have to find it again.
Me: So what's special about this car?  Seller: It's very expensive.
I swear to you, you could price that car at 80K and no one would bat an eyelid. It does not and it is not a one million dollar car. Would I swap it for my alfa Romeo quadrifoglio? Feck no. Mine with options etc cos just over 80K. Whoever pays over a million for that car either has too much money or no sense and too much money.
i'd rather buy basically any other car with this amount of money. its a good looking car with good enough features, but it is not good enough for 1 million dollars. i'd rather have a mansion
Some people might find my words over exaggerated but I'd say even the ghost with all options added has a more well designed and more appealing interior than this , the ghost also has  automatic opening and closing doors it has wooden trims and the aluminium u see in this car the ghost has chrome finish on them
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CAR I'VE EVER SEEN, BUT NOT WORTH MILLION, NO SUN ROOF,  NO AUTO LOCK DOORS!!  BUT BEAUTIFUL
1 million for aston martinish dodge charger back look seems ok....
A way to go for Aston to make some 100mil profit for putting a badge from 1940ies on a 6meter pressed piece of metal with leather seats
3 years old, and still for sale with 88 miles. Ain't nobody stupid enough to buy this!
That is a very expensive Camry, just look at the rear roof support.
The hydraulic door holder thing... Awesome! Way to go Brits.... Oh wait, every American SUV has them, and some open and close with a click of a button... yawn.
If Tiffany and company sold a $1M pile of dog shit and put their label on it you can be assured somebody would buy it
What an ugly car
Overpriced! Not worth it, cheap Ford parts and parts from an old model. RR all day over this.
1 million for a generic looking car with moderate luxury 😂😂
0:26 I guess I would Go on Mars and buy it, probably would cost same as second hand COROLA.
Turath actually means heritage in arabic
needs paint, lol for a million id want some shiny paint. lol
Why do these fancy cars have ashtrays? Who the fuck is smoking Newports in a Lagonda?
3:33 why is he seated behind the car? 🤔😂
The price is an insult. Specialy for a brand that doesn't build their own engines.
this car is a work of art and therfefore.... priceless. Designwise off the scale in my book, disclaimer  taste is subjective. My budget is insufficient by far to buy & own . Even as an investment, this kind of artworks only go up in value over time if properly cherisched.
This car is a piece of art, for sure. But one million dollars? Come on... You must be kidding me 🤣
And to think... the wheels look like the base 2015  challenger scatpack
This car sucks
Despite the price, Doug is right, it is one of the most beautiful cars ever made.  That wrap is awful though!  I agree it's not worth $1 million, but it is absolutely gorgeous!
I saw nothing that justifies such a ludicrous pricetag.
It looks freakin terrible!! What the f is wrong with Dougs taste in cars???
ترف it’s name in Arabic
Bruh a Bentley isn’t even 1/3 of this price and it looks 3x better.
People may get mad at me or saying this, but I don’t think this car is worth 1 mil at all. Yes, it is gorgeous, but otherwise it’s fine. Seems much more at home around 150k.
It's ugly. There! I said it
I came here looking for a million-dollar sedan and I just found a low tech overpriced piece of leather. This is the most disappointing car ever.
100k on a merc is better than that thing
This car is simply OVERRATED and OVERPRICED. Note: Taraf (ترف) in Arabic language means ultra luxury
It looks like an elongated Ford Fusion, and a toyota has a better cockpit than this.
It’s hilarious how everyone in the comment section thinks that this 4-5 year old car is still 1 million dollars. On top of that it was never sold in North America as there wasn’t a market for it here. Obviously none of you like it, get over it
Looks like mine 2017 Mondeo!!!!! Wtf????
Doug, the type of guy to borrow a Lamborghini Chiron just to advertise his website
Seems like Doug has never seen a Maybach from the inside.
The doors opening slightly upward was done similarly in the large 1960s Jaguar Mk.10 / Mk.X luxury saloon — later renamed the 420G.
The Bentley Flying Spur looks much nicer than this car
So why does this car cost a million dollars? Cause there's only a hundred of them?
a maybach is 9 times more cheap than this and is thousand times better than this lagonda
You could have 250 brand new Yugo’s for the price of this. Wrap your head around that.
Surely there's not 120 idiots in the world that would walk past Rolls Royce for this ? Surely not
Definitely the dumbest car to buy at the price point!
What an ugly car.
اسمها "ترف" هههههههههه
Rolls Royce is like a regular sushi restaurant to this car, this is like a three star Michelin restaurant
I was waiting for Bulletproof windows and other crazy stuff turns out this car is a complete joke smh
This is better than the rolls royce true but  not as worth it to buy as the rolls royce
The word "distinctive" is misused in this video.
I've never disagreed with Doug so much.  That car is nowhere near the most beautiful sedan ever made.  Not even top 10 in 2015.  And the worst looking car by Aston.  Doug was feeling good 🍺 before he made this one.  Plus, Aston interiors still suck....even for a million dollars.
Garmin in 1 million Ultra Luxury sedan.. 😹😹 Imagine it's raining and you realised umbrella is in the boot.. Not in the door like RR..
Mukesh Ambani used to drew salary of 2.5 Million USD per month... :)
This is the most expensive blunder made by Aston Martin . 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Million dollar car with Ford Taurus looks...  Edit: I typed that before he mentioned the Ford Taurus, funny he said it.
Doug Who Paid You????
This is a GTA 5 Customized 2028 Honda Accord Change My Mind
What the krubfktdhflt is that what kind of things bought this "car"
For that money the guys at Aston could have lifted the quad-zone climate control of a 1st gen Mercedes CLS, with left-right rear seat digital readout, simply by buying the cars, removing the system, and throwing  out the rest. And no ventilated seats? Nahhh...
10:00 Yea looks like it toi
If Chrysler wanted to save the failed second generation 200 they could have changed the C pillar to look like the one on this car, improved rear headroom and put variant of the grill from the 300 on it and it would have been successful.
Wtf does this car have that a Mercedes S-Class doesn't?
The front reminds me of the new chevys
This car is truly beautiful but i wouldn't pay more than 300k
Unpopular opinion: just because it is rare doesnt mean it has to be that pricy, this thing is ridiculously overpriced, not even that beautiful and people wont even care that it is rare, average people in fact wont even notice it on the road
Aston Martin done nothing with lagonda than spoils with them  because Doug say they  concerned about details but they dont even changed the  Gauge into  miles shows  their concern about lagonda
This would be a great 2-300k car 1 million seems like way too much
10:04 Doug tries to play off the fact the door started closing completely contradicting his original statement.
How can Aston possibly justify having this car priced at $1million? I could see 500 000, but overall just ridiculous lol. The craftsmanship is there, but the features, cheap plastic and navigation system are done a whole lot better from cars at a massive fraction of the price
Good salesman
Rolls Royce has a crappy push button auto close function, where you can control any door from the drivers seat . Plus they have built in umbrellas. Gross Lagonda has a uber exclusive gas strut so your door stays where you place it. Fancy Rolls Royce only has a stupid Starry Headliner which has fully customisable constellations to your liking. Lame Lagonda has a super exclusive leather roof liner. Ohhhh Rolls Royce has a retarded in build rear head rest screen that is revealed automatically at a push of a button and fully integrated. Stupid Lagonda has a much more exclusive clip where you can mount your Ipad if you have one. Amazing Rolls Royce has a proprietary sat nav system in which the rear passenger can access from the back seat and give new directions to the driver. Who needs that? Lagonda has a Garmin. Oh Yeah!
This car looks like someone took a Ford Focus to a coach builder, pointed at the Rapide, and said “make it like so”.
Out of all the cars you have rated..this is the most beautiful sedan of all time to you?
Genesis
Now i understand why is this sold just to Arabs, nobody other has such a shit taste 🤣
Its not better looking than a Rolls Royce or for that matter even a BMW 7 series or a Mercedes s class or Maybach... beauty is in the eye of the beholder of course but honestly it’s not a 1 million dollar beauty... AT BEST it’s a 150-200 thousand dollars beauty... even if I was a billionaire I would spend 1 million dollars on that car...
even the jaguar xj is worth more than this piece of crepe
I’d buy two Phantoms instead
10:04 lmaooo
Oh my god, its so beautiful
That's a suped up Maserati of the 90s,  in the looks department
A one million dollar car and they could not integrate a charger into the ipad mount...
Wouldn't waste my money on this car
Wow 1 million nos for this car and video
The only place they could justify the expense, would be the UAE lol. That interior color looks like it would smell funny. Doug, you're way too easily entertained, by that Astin Martin key ( it's the same, as the hatchback ) bro lol.
"... most beautiful 4 door car..."??  Look at the drop-dead gorgeous MAZDA concept car - which may well be the next MAZDA 6 with a new 6 cylinder Skyactive X engine. So, all 4 seats heated AND cooled I assume? My "pedestrian" MAZDZ CX-5 GT Reserve (AWD turbo) has 4 heated seats but only the front seats are cooled. :o(
its looks like honda city lol
The Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf Is the World's Most Ugly Luxury Sedan
Most expensive Sedan *Looks like a riced Elantra* RR ghost is much better
For a Million Dollar Sedan you get:   - iPads in the back that aren’t even charged in their holders   - Ford Focus turn stalk  - Garmin Navigation....not even CarPlay?  - too many of the cheap Aston Martin parts.....  why the higher price tag? I guess must be the leather.
2:01 "specific market demand" he is talking about is probably too much money and not much taste.
Those iPads supports are the most aftermarket thing I've ever seen. Just seeing at them you understand that you can spend a fraction of its price to buy a top-marque BMW 760Li fully optioned with Individual touches.
Looks like a Ford Fusion
The exclusivity comes from the fact that not many people who are rich enough to buy this are actually dumb enough to pay for it.
Honestly I'm pretty disappointed, I was hoping for a lot more quirks and features.
1 million dollars and they put a garmin gps as the info screen🤣
Dude no way this worth a million dollars lol
I don't get it at all. Beauty *must* be in the eye of the beholder because I'm not seeing it here. It looks like a weird giant... car. The matte paint looks really gimmicky, like that kid down the street that wrapped his 350Z because he whacked a McDonald's drive thru pole and doesn't know how to paint.   And then there's the price. Expensive for the sake of expensive isn't "exclusivity". It's just milking people who don't know better, or, worse, don't care. The fact that it has its own brand has a certain kind of irony to it as the first thing that came to mind with the price, naming, and borrowed parts is that it's more or less a "lifestyle brand". In that sense, it's the "Trump University" of cars.
All those who dislike the car can’t afford to buy it.
"It is the LUXURY branch of ASTON MARTIN" Please read this again
The front looks like an accord from the side 😂
German cars are the best when it comes to luxury the engineering they put is crazy. Rolls Royce would make sure the hinge on that door was not visible. That shit is an after thought from Lagonda/Aston Martin
I'LL take the Rolls.
I get the vibe someone behind the camera is pointing a AK-47 on Doug DeMuro
How much did they pay you Doug?
Is that james bond car in the spectre
Watch Doug  drive it  through Arby's and pound down a #1 with extra curly fries!
I might consider for 100k. Probably realistic with 50.000 miles on it. 😆😅🤣
doesn't the Bugatti cost a million dollars too?
James bond is going to be happy once he sees this.
I hate this car. That high price for this over-priced car makes me fkn vomit.
Your entire credibility went out the window when you gave this a 10/10 for styling or hyping this car in general.
Doug must be getting a drink from the owner when this car sells... 🤷🏾‍♂️
Rich people have ugly taste. Just give me a hellcat charger I'll be ok..
At least the button of the cooler would have not been plastic.
it seems they wanted to ganged up the car Mate black ,no gloss
Doug for sure was paid to hype this car. What idiot would pay a million for this? It is garbage and they should be ashamed for trying to rip everyone off.
Give me a genesis g80
I’ll take a genesis g90
The ugliest sedan I ever seen
This car makes a phantom value for money
The color is awful
Glad I found this channel! Your videos are so good!
Sooooo basically it is a Aston Martin Rapide with a Bodykit for additional 800.000$ ? I’ll take a rapide or rapide s over this !
looks like Ford Focus
Can you say ugly
it reminds me of a dutch clog. anyone else see this?
Looks like a 2020 honda insight from the front
One million dollars? The fuck bro
Front looks like a new accord 😶
Honda Accord  front rip off.  And compare to the super cars on price from a segment that the Luxury and tradicional houses dominate don't go insane on the price factor. Hyper cars and super cars are expensive not only for the limit number of cars but mainly for the Speed.
This is about the biggest Bullshit I have ever seen.
Look at the interior. Looks like it’s from a 2007 luxury sports car than a 2020 luxury sedan that’s worth a whole ass mansion.
his love for astons shows up quite clearly
the name of the car is TAA RAF it's an Arabic word,  which in short means to live in a way that all your wants and needs are fulfilled.
This reminds me of that Chinese Rolls Royce knockoff from like 10 years ago. It looks like it's trying to be a high end luxury car but something is just off about it.
This has the be one of the ugliest designs on a luxury sedan. The Maybach 600, Phantom & Musanne are leaps and bounds ahead of this car in every way. Basically you buy this car just so you can say you bought a million dollar car.
10/10 styling? What a joke.
I would rather have a rapid even if they were the same price
Am I the only one that thinks this car is ugly? I would much rather have a Bentley Flying Spur if I had that kind of money to spend on a sedan.
the worlds most luxurious dodge charger
i was hoping to see another taraf overtaking while he's talking about rarity, that would have been funny:)
megadollar horizontal skyscraper
1 mil for something that isn’t even beter than a S-class Maybeach. That mil is wasted moneyyy
I WOULD NEVER BUY SUCH A CAR
Sheikh Abdul rehman's custom Honda accord.
My Chrysler 300 is more luxurious than that
Yo isn’t he on the red parking garage in gta by maze bank? Or is it just me
The first car on Earth that looks like it has a receding hairline! It looks like it sounds like a character from The Sims. They should've named it The Homer.
Most expensive sedan part 34
This car is pure scam....I can't believe what you saying and praising it for so much Doug....
Bruuh...how much they paid you 😜😂😅😅 10:03 the door doesn't stay exactly
You should really, really try to review the Astin Martin Vulcan.   Insane car!
bro what are you on, the styling isnt a 10, its a 6 maybe
Any day phantom
its expensive because of small numbers(expensive manufacturing costs) not quality   i mean 120
This was designed for shallow people who don't care what it is but only what it costs
It was a cash grab marketed for oil sheiks in Dubai that spend 1m a day on diamond aks that have multiple Rolls Royce
10:03 dough "you can open the door and it will stay exactly there"          Me "I don't think so"
I'll take new m5 over this
Looks like Aston Martin made a challenger drom the side lol
You pay a million dollars and you don't even get a sunroof.
No reason for this to cost as much as 5 S classes
Better it drives on its own and make my breakfast
1 Million and no electric trunk?!
13:25 uncircumcised buckles
Looks like shit
Wouldn’t pay 100k for that thing
Lancia thesis is better car inside
Is that pollution in the distance? You can hardly see the hills
Is it just me, or does the  2020 Honda Accord look like the Lagonda Taraf?
Very very nice honda accord
This might be the most aggressively beautiful car I've ever seen.
This car just looks like someone threw up brown leather all over it
Is it weird I never think people who can own cars like these have kids😂 like obviously they do but every time I see a review for a really nice car and it has stuff for children I’m like “why would you put a child in an Ashton Martin” 😂
An exclusively stupid display of riches, not wealth.
A lazy, lazy production car.  How you gave it a 10/10 only shows you drank the cult juice.
They just built this car to see who’s stupid enough to pay $1m for this Hyundai Azera looking sedan
It doesn’t look 1M at all ...
Sweptail: am i a joke to you??
If i had this i would sell it and buy 1 big house and Toyota Land Cruiser
This should be under 100k no new tec doesn't worth comparing it with rolls Royce i would choose benz e class over this faster sportier more luxurious more tec
None of the features were that great tbh
BMW E38 has electric boot lid option and doesn't cost a mil.
For $1 Million I would atleast expect it to have a 3D style lightbar for taillights . Such a snooze fest design.
Why would you be so damn stupid to buy one of this lagonda instead of a Rolls Royce Phantom and some Ferrari or Lamborghini???
Thats a 60k car wtf they smoking? Shit got no specs in the backseat and the front is regular. You’ll be a idiot too buy a basic ass car for a mil ticket.
Ewww...... That is one ugly car you got there.
Someone get my boy Doug some knee pads!
The front looks kinda like a ford fusion..
looks like a dodge dart😹
This car encapsulates why Aston is always worrying about bankruptcy.  Just give us elegant sportscars as sleek as the old DB9 and Vantage.
Even if there are only 5 of those, i still prefer any model of RR
E38 7 series, beautiful?  Chris Bangle
LOL, If you listen closly you can hear the faint laughter of Aston Martin Executives when they hear that someone bought this shit car. The outgoing S class is substantially better than this car.
Great car thanks sir.key is great 1st time see
I HATE the interior. Gross.
shittiest way to spend a million
Quattraporte and £950:000 in change. Simples.
This car looks like luxury version of ford mondeo...
It is a shame... for shameless Aston Martin
The interior tech is so outdated, and this car is so overpriced! I’d rather have the Flying Spur- so much nicer and better looking, and way more features. And, it’s 750,000 dollars less.
do you get a free house with this car?
The door handle to Doug: Pull my finger.. then farted. :)
The cool part is that it says 'Lagonda and not Aston Martin' and that's pretty cool...
this car is so worthless. i could have an aventador svj and an urus and an r8 for the price of this shit
This is dumb not even worth it
How did this weird looking thing get 10 for styling? Doug got paid to make this video.
It’s nice but it’s certainly overpriced
i am from the middleEast but taraf  means edge (طرف)
n-as cumpara o masina care sa aiba taraf in nume :)))))))))))))))))
Breath taking? Really
The Honda Accord looks really nice
I’d rather get 2.5 Bulletproof Apocalypse ready Rezvani Tanks with the money
24:43 this should be the intro.  Imagine pulling out of the dealership after leaving $1M, and at the stop light noticing the turn signal on the Ford Focus next to you.  The real reason its rare is because they know no one in their right mind would pay $1M for this level of “luxury”.   Even the chauffer would choose a Rolls Royce over this. RR conveniently has the umbrella in the door. Lagonda makes you go back to the trunk,  reach all the way and undo the Velcro straps. Thanks for the back ache and rain soaked back Lagonda
It looks like shit
Looks like Audi  R8  frm  front...totally copied
Was doug paid by aston martin for this?
there are probably 100 cars i'd rather have than that if money wasn't an object.   that car sucks
been watching you for a while now, love your videos. we must have different taste, because this car is ugly as hell.  and the NEW 4 series grills are SWEET!!!
It’s overpriced because there are only 50 of them in the world and no more will be nuilt
So basically  the price is for the leather and 10 lagonda logo?? This car has absolutely nothing of interest, not even its own TV!!
This is no way near Rolls-Royce phantom..just overpriced i think.
I agree that it looks good but NOT as much as the E38. The BMW is still the greatest looking sedan ever! 😤
what a scuffed car
All these people saying that it's not worth $1m. Of course it's not but it was aimed at the middle East. Those idiots would pay any price for something like this.
Love the fact that the DAB radio is still tuned to Talk Sport. Obviously once owned by an Arab living in the 🇬🇧. 🤣😂🤣😂.
the rear view mirror looks like its from my hyundai hybrid
you would be mad as a box of frogs to spend 1 million on this
Aston gotta be crazy. Why choose this over a maybach. It’s good looking but the new Bentley flying spur is a lot better. That price I can have a flying spur, maybach and a ghost. Absolutely not worth it.
Where is million dollor feature which is distinct from others..?🤔🤔
In India we have to pay 250% tax for fully imported  cars
I STILL PREFER A ROLLS ROYCE 😏
That disgusting looking ipad mounts on a million dollar car is unacceptable!
This car is just overpriced
The cealing is leather that's it ! No stary night disappointing
Crap not worth $200k at max
Way overrated car. Just cause it has low numbers made. It's not even impressive on the outside or inside. To me it's quite average. Looks good but it's not the most beautiful. There's no such thing. It's all in the eye of the beholder.
Car is pretty basic to be 1m
Why not using hairband to hang the camera while recording to get good feel of the drive of the car
I could buy a nice house AND AT LEAST an RR Ghost with that kind of money...
Front: Ford Fusion ✅ Sides: Honda Accord ✅ Back: Chevy Camaro ✅
So this is iPhone of Cars? Below Average product. Disturbingly overpriced targeted at people with more money than brain.
this car is hideous and dumb
Gimme a Cadillac black wing...
That matt paint and the big alloys.. naff!
If I had a million dollars, I wouldn't spend it on an Aston.
Man all I want is a Volvo or a polestar
That grill is Joker's smile and the car looks cheap. Expecially wheels, they belong to some Civic and that key hole... I mean really???
Front of this car is very very like i8!!!
1. - Put a glass panel in between of windows. 2. - Charge 1.000.000 USD.
This car gets shamed by other luxury sedans that are half the price
They are clever to make only 120 of these to minimize the loss, it won’t sell
Stupid marky color. Ugly grill (yeah just say hello giant grill hype). And interior? Pay one mill to feel yourself like in giant leather stomach? Hell No! What wrong with the people these days? Where are all good designers? Are they all died already and the era of elegant cars is gone?
The colour is amazing
a lincoln continental is more rare and cool than this shit
so expensive and so boring
This is ridiculously overpriced ...
The front looks like a 2018 Ford Fusion 😑😑
Doug is the type of guy who answers his own questions.
It looks like a gta car and is priced like one too
I just came back to say I still can’t believe how ugly this car is
The front looks like a spruced up Ford Fusion.
worst....
🤮🤮🤮
The outside looks like it’s from 2018 but the inside looks like it’s from 2008
It looks like Ford Mondeo.
Looks like 20,000
The most expensive luxury sedan in the world in flat black is perfect irony.
Worth 20 Camels of good origin or 1 breeder. I.e. Not that much -_-
What a stupid way to spend 1 million !! This is  laterally a rip off !! 😠
I'm sure that rich suckers in the Middle East have no issues with paying one million dollars for an automobile that's not worth it
Meh.
I prefer to buy a Rolls-Royce and a villa and enjoy the rest of the million dollars instead of buying this junk.
That car sure is very beautiful and luxurious. Still not worth 1 a million dollars.
I HATE THIS CAR SO UNBELIEVABLY MUCH IS MAKES ME ENRAGED THAT SOMEONE WOULD SPEND 1 MILLION DOLLARS
I stay with RR, this one looks too cute for 1 mill
I really don't find the exterior THAT nice
How much did they pay you to make this video?
he saying this era like it was from 1985
Those red callipers have no place on this car
if you own this car then you are not rich, you are just idiot with money.
I also love this car Doug. It has the front of a DB9. It has the rear of a Old school Charger and somehow they married those two parts with a middle that just makes all the lines work. Truly one of the most beautiful cars I have ever seen.
So this car cost $1M and they put cheap ipads instead of ipad pros!!!
worlds ugliest *
Thank God I wasn't the only one thinking "Wait, that shit costs as much as two Phantoms, the king of luxury cars????"!!!!!!!|
The roof is really not applying to the rest of the sporty look. I would have given the styling a 7 out of 10
I gotta tell ya Doug beginning ya had later u made me not really like the car Nomore they went cheap way in a million dollar mansion on wheels fukk aston martin
Looks like a Maserati
Worths mostly like a 60k sedan! It's very sad to see a company like Aston struggling so hard to keep up with the rest of the market, but I don't think that making ridiculously priced cars would fix it! Hope now with Mercedes involved they help this legendary company to regain its former glory once again. Also, I don't get it why Doug gets amazed by the fact that the headlights or rear lights partially become turn signals! Dude it's the most basic thing that an LED can do! LOL
Has no austin martin dna at all. More like lamborghin8
I think the car looks amazing, but it’s not worth 1 mill. Astons been taking inspiration from GTA V with the pricing.
It worth no more than 120k
Lol For a little less luxury you can buy Honda Accord 2020 you will save $970,000
Nice car, but imagine the upkeep cost
The wheels look like Porsche crests.
This junk can't hold a candle to a RR. Only tacky middle east oil lords and yellow chinese billionaires would buy this inelegant overpriced accord.
No tinted windows? Uhm.
Wait I’m confused what’s the point of having a v12 with 500 hp when the Chrysler’s hellcat engine can produce 707hp with only 8 cylinders
This is like a car straight out of GTA online, with its looks and it’s unnecessarily high price tag 😂
A million dollar price and no usb type c charger port
So we are getting a UMBRELLA for million dollar
A million dollar car and the trunk is not closing automatically
FUGLY
I rather buy corolla
This taraf is uglier than the OG lagonda
My dad's hyundai has two usb ports in the backseat
Grill looks like mazda suv
So if it was never sold in US, how come you can buy it when some JDM needs to be 25yrs old to sell here?
Very pretty, but it's obviously just an Aston that cost a million dollars because idiots would pay a million dollars.  Nothing special.
It's ugly a.f
One million dollars for a car that they didn't finish painting??? LMAO it's primered. Wtf
absolutely top max 200 k , but hey , it's anniversary , lets put a cool mill , quess they test how much superrich will pay , it's normal now cars to come out of the factory costing 5 million , there's no way these prices will stand , fake exclucivity , they did only 3 of those in carbon so it's extra 300.000 :D
Looks like a genesis g90
I gotta say Doug I'm a little disappointed. The fact that you didn't speak on the beautiful quilted engine cover beneath the hood, well that truly broke my heart!! 🤣
Anyone else thinks it kind of looks like a camry?
It doesn’t look like a million dollar car. Seriously 😒
I'm not impressed even little, looks mediocre, in my opinion. Absolutely overpriced and looks worse than aston martin, I'd prefer. Btw this locks right on the front doors looks terrible for car, priced more that 50k. And I'd expect single peace glass roof in such car. Interior electronics and panels is kinda outdated for 20 years. :D
Damn it... It looks so good
144p display
After that loto win I still don’t think this would be on the wish list
The world most ugly car
Also the previous Lagonda was waste of money. Only value is and was exotic and limited numbers.
The way Doug talks about this awfully overpriced car gives me a sponsored "cash for comment" feel...
Doug loves kneeling tbh
A $35k Hyundai has more advanced technology than this $ 1MILLION car !!
I don't really like it , especially for a million dollars.
So basically your paying for the brand and rarity ok noted✍🏾
Looks like a 2012 on the inside
Me: So what you're telling me is that a 2013 Hyundai Equus has the same or better features, and my phone has a better NAV system.   Lagonda: Yes, but look how great my styling is.
As much as i love aston martin i rather have a r34
My god it's just fucking ugly and overpriced.
I request you to gather public to laugh at the person you spot driving this car...only a stupid would buy this over a S class, Bentley or Rolls Royce
Why does it sound like he hits a can everything he turns
The grill looks like a joker smile
What?  No hate for the font on the transmission buttons?  The 2021 Aston Martin Vantage Roadster would like a word with you, Doug.
I think that this car isn't even on a level of an S Class and paying 2× the price of a Rolls Royce for this thing (even if you have money to throw away) is just stupid...
i love it  looks classic and modern at same time
I think I seen an old Lagonda like you had in this video
The exterior and interior already look outdated. They have no match with RR's quality. I dont even want this for 60-80k if someone sold it to me. This is so much like the ghibli. People will buy this for the brand and nothing else. Please blink twice if you are under hostage by saying `it is the most gorgeous car'. The front has that Honda Accord/Hyundai look. Horrible looking front end. Side just a stretched out Aston without anything to compliment. Rear they try to make it too simple making it bland. Rims look like a budget Discount Tire rim. Headlights are horrible. Brakes lights look great. The headliner already has creases, that would bother me so much. Nothing high tech. No soft close door. No semi self driving. Ugly analog speedometer. Steering wheel looks like its from 2006. This is an ugly outdated car with leather wrapped around everything and small fridge. What the hell is this car? I love Doug but I swear he is getting paid offby saying this is the best looking car.
This is the world's most beautiful car? Doug, have you officially completely lost it?
It better be bullet proof and self drive and park
The most unimpressed I have ever been for a $ 1000000 merchandise..
You know you’ve made it when you get to test drive this car for your YouTube channel.
U just keep trying to over sweet talk about this garbage
the turn signals dont turn orange... there's just more intensity on the command
There is nothing better than Maybach in luxury sedan market. Or at least RR Phantom.
Does this car come with Jason Statham to drive you around and train your children in car etiquette?
My dad is getting one next week lol
The thumbnail makes the car look like someone went to photoshop and stretched it
Beautiful car (not a fan of the exterior paint though), So over priced though.
Probably the ugliest car ever 😐
Think I'll pass on this one at least that's what I thought when I saw the navigation system and the interior yes the seats are beautiful or leather is beautiful but do not have modern infotainment and other electronics seems kind of crazy to me
Bruh taraf   does not mean ultimate luxury in Arabic
It must feel like sitting in a goddamn baseball glove with all that leather like holy shit. Kinda makes me claustrophobic.
Imagine dropping the key, shattering that glass bit, and then having to see it non-stop whenever you drove the car.
27:44 he said I dont have a million dollars.....So I bought one
17:45 such an easy way to lose or forget the key
Am I the only one who sees a ford mondeo/fusion in the front?
Why do you over exaggerated things dude
No way is this car worth 1 million dollars. It will be broke down within 20 years
This is outrageous in terms of tech and interior design... a golf has better features
Aston Martin : outdated cars with outdated technology and incredibly overpriced. How can this be double the price than a Rolls-Royce Phantom ? It is not even half as good
How can that car cost 1M$
Think you are forgetting the  A/M  ONE 77 ??   Also having been an A/M owner,have to say the shape of the rear  window's leaves a lot to be desired.SO SQUARE !!
He just said this was made for arabs and missed the word “moron”
You have SEATS in a million dollar car! Such a nice luxurious touch!
Is this car a Joke? Wtf are those key holes? A hydraulic cylinder to hold the doors in position? Wtf? (Which doesnt even work)... ipads as screens instead of some Aston Martin displays? The steering wheel looks so cheap omg. You must be completely dumb to prefer this over a nice countryside house with garden AND a S63 AMG AND a Porsche Macan turbo... so a house , a ultra luxury car and a luxury suv or this Aston...
1 million but you have to buy the tablets for the rear seats?
This is how Maserati should have styled their cars.
If it was a Chrysler, it would be laughed at as a POS. And why does he talk that way?
16:50
This car is absolutely gorgeous, worth every penny 👌🏽
the front looks like a galant or ford mondeo
i'm my own heated seat.
I love Ford Fusions 😍🤩😆🤭😉
10:04 “The door will stay exactly there”  Door: *Proceeds to close.*
No1 else is stupid enough to pay million dollars for this that's why they sell them in originally in  Dubai.
This car literally looks like a vehicle from GTA V where it's insanely dull and you gave it 10/10 for styling? Doug what the heck is wrong with you?
So cute how fascinated he is with the DRL/indicator combo. They are not really that special, but AFAIK they are against regulations in the US which is why cars don't normally have that there.
Ok, after watching more of the vid, someone just really wanted to pay $1M for a car to say they did it. This car is a joke, plain and simple.
So a $1,000,000 car has 10 year old technology...too funny
Taraf is Arabic origin word means luxury
This is definetly NOT the most beautiful sedan ever built!
Someone paid Doug to hype that car, it absolutely isn’t worth it.
That thing ain't worth a million dollars
Let's be honest if you had 1 million dollars you ain't buying this
Ridiculous price. This is nothing more than just a glorified Rapide.
10:03 it will stay precisely there, ummm, except for here.
tbh this isn't worth 1 million
Taraf doesn’t mean anything in Arabic.
Bruh my Ford Flex is more luxurious than this
I hate that specific engine because its not a 6.0 its a 5.9. i know its stupid to hate because of that but for me the engine is permanently lying to me.
So its exterior is a mix of 5 different domestics, the interior has sub par features, ford escort turn signal, crap garmin gps, manual trunk, not quick on the gas, looked a little bumpy on the drive. Saying its the most beautiful is obviously the opinion of someone that has horrible taste in elegance. Just say it Doug. You didnt want to hurt the owners feelings because he actually let you drive this and he has way more money than you. The only person laughing when you pull away from a red light is Aston Martin on their way to the bank. Looks like they 40k in R&D and the actual build. My taco score out of 100 is in the negatives.
For that much money the back center console and the steering wheel should have been much better. And ac vents
Imagine spending 1 million for this lol could get 5 lambo trucks or 5 maybachs
But is the headliner Corinthian leather?
Terrible interior FCA has better ones
Dougs making a lot of money from Aston Martin to make this vid. Kudos to him
I would rather buy a land make a big apartment for rent and quietly enjoy tat rent money till i die 😂😂😂
Wtf the Lexus ls460 has a better backseat 😂
I don't see any luxury car here, its just a car like any other car. I have seen many beautiful and luxury cars on your channel with less expensive.
GTA car
S class is better than this
Bro what it literally looks like a Ford Fusion 😂🤦
Damn bro, GTA starting to sell cars irl?
10:03. He tells us the door stays exactly where we want it , then he proceeds to show us and the door started to close lmao
Overpriced ❌  Hyperpriced ✔️
Brah it’s called broguing.  The holes
Did I miss what makes this a million dollars?
Look like a long ass pointy dress shoe👞
Anyone else think the front looks like a mixture of a Ford Taurus, Honda Accord and maybe slight Maserati vibes?
Pointless car
Dough how much did they pay 💰 u 😂😂😂
No thanks, Maserati Sedan is way more beautiful.  I will take the Trofeo
Dough says "at its time" like it 20 years old
Looks like a car you would buy used for 15k
one million and you don't even get tinted glass? WTH?
over priced as fuck rr washes this car every categors for over half the price
2022 Ford Fusion- baller package
Doug must've snorted some of the coke that comes with the car, this car does not look that great, apart from loads of leather, which makes one wonder how much does it cost to leatherize a car.  I forgot what year he said this car came out
Cooliest features: Hydraulic bar on the door  Thats it. Ok and the fridge but who would drink in such a car 🤧
So I can get a rolls Royce phantom for half the price for more luxury....  Good job Aston Martin
One milion dollar crap
front looks like  a camry
Gorgeous car. But its Arabic name!! Teally dont know what its means?? Im Arabic never heard of that word Logonda or Torant!!
Is this guy trolling us?! Rolls-Royce Phantom, Ghost; Bentley Mulsanne, Flying Spur as well as the new Merc S class, Audi A, BMW 7 series for that matter, would drive the shit out of this all-so-rare _Lagonda Turd-as -fuck_ to the moon and back!
Being a car of that price tag it's just disappointed me to its level best.  it is merely existing in name.
Not worth a million. Rather buy a rolls or Bentley
Cant imagine replacing this with  Rolls Royce's with ths mistake Honda
A Bentley copy that costs more
You won't see this car anywhere else than dealerships...
This is just ugly 😑wtf...it looks like the front, the sides and the back are from different cars ..... A rolls Royce base model will feel better than this
Doug, my man, how many likes will it take to get you a new pair of shoes?
not that special
This is a beautiful car but about ten times the price it should be. Who would buy this?
Mhh, I don't like that it's still a production line car. I like to go bespoke on my cars.
Rebodied Rapide in a good looking shell for five times the price? Yep make 120 of them and call them 'exclusive'. Great marketing tool.
Great car. I've seen it in Dubai - a black one. https://www.instagram.com/p/B4gFeF9IGyq/?igshid=1h6tlo9wdun25 ..but I'm also in love with my E38 7-series! 😍
this is just a rapide with a different body
some of the leather looked like it was shrinking and i couldnt stop thinking about it
at 8:05 "The $370,000 Aston Martin Lagonda Is the Weirdest Luxury Car Ever" also at 8:05 "Built Ford Proud" - I wonder if this is some kind of reference to the fact that Ford, at one time, owned Aston Martin (or at least part of it?) . . .yeah yeah I know it's just a coincidental ad
Outdated car. Has got only one cork — the price
Looks like a mitsubishi galant with leather. Truly not impressed
imagine buying this instead of 2 phantoms
Doug i love your videos but surely a dealership like that would make sure not to have cars that expensive they are scratched to hell? The promo segment for the dealer you can see scratches all over that car!
#UGLY
Seems like they made a Camaro on the outside with a longer bonnet. The only thing that stands out is the all-leather interior, which I'm sure someone can make it like that for 10 grand.  Anyway, just another overpriced Brittish car, only this time rediculously overpriced.
doug believe live in other planet.."in entire planet" he means there is more in other planet
I will buy rolls Royce million times over this lol if I had that much money. It looks like a mix of Ferrari interior and weird shape outside.
The front end looks really similar to the redesigned Honda Accord and I just can’t help seeing it every time i look at it
The first owner is tanked.
I was interested to buy one of these, but 15:30 was the dealbreaker.
You would have to be insane to pay the price of 2 brand new Phantoms in this car
The circular strip pattern running down the centre of the seats and armrest is taken from the Lagonda series 3 you reviewed before, in that car the pattern ran across the seats.
wtf I never seen this Aston what the heeelll
Dude it's not that worth at all........would rather prefer Phantom, Ghost, Maybach S class or an Audi A8L ❤️❤️
https://youtu.be/h2fVaMxhPDs Cafreal
@floydmayweather they said you can't get it
THIS!... is another great video, thanks Doug
How is it I've never heard of this?
Its such a stupid car, ugly buttons and labels, ugly gage cluster, ford focus blinker switch...just perfect for the tasteless shepards born on oil.
I'm disappointed Doug, even that rear seats can't be compared with what an S class have. I think you weren't honest reviewing this regular car.
Man you have to be an A1 sucker to buy this thing.
Goosebumps Haunted Car lookin ass
Where i live in my country Saudi Arabia I saw it 3 times and i thought its chip aston martin then i watched this video and i was like hold up
When I look at this car Radio Los Santos starts playing in my head for some reason.
nobody: doug: thhhhhhissss
This car is trash
this car is ugly lol.. it looks like a genesis haha
It doesn't look very luxurious to me at all.. quite cheap looking actually to be honest.
I want a TESLA car
Doug, you have horrible taste to think that's one of most beautiful cars. Nothing about it is worth a million dollars, not even the rarity of it.
why is dougs way of advertising cars&bids so overly dramatic😂😂
This is a Maserati from the side.
Leave that thing at the dealer man. Just making this video you made me nervous. I couldn’t pay attention to the specs bc I was so worried about you somehow breaking it. 😂. Dougie, that car is not that beautiful, looks a misshaped challenger.
This better be better than the Rolls Royce Phantom VIII
TTHHHIISSSSS! ...is the Plymouth Champ TURBO!
Relax it’s not that beautiful especially not for a million
The Rolls Royce Phantom is a bargain compared to this.
Have you ever accidentally had Doug speaking in one tab while playing him in another? its very weird...Lol
This look like my ordinary car stretched 😂
This is a Gimmick hence the Low numbers in production....this car is not worth Double of the Bentley Flying Spur..Mulsanne...Rolls Royce Ghost etc etc....
1 million dollar accord
To be honest it's side looks like a long 60 Mustang
The biggest disappointment with this car is the heated seats for the Middle East market. Moreover, I doubt that the car even has an option for cooling the rear seats.
Gotta be the biggest waste of a million dollars🤦🏻‍♂️ a 2017 Hyundai Elantra has a nicer infotainment system
Finally, a car that kids can call a GTA V car.
I hate to say this but it looks like a mondeo😖
Audi S8 That's enough for me.
lol 2 phantoms or this. Hmmmmmmm
Looks like a Camaro fucked a Maserati Quattroporte. Terrible. Central console also looks terrible.
This car is totally.... Stupid
Looks like Audi because of a front grill shape and headlights
I would love to own one of these, it's like a limo and I remember it being unveiled in 2015. I gotta get my money up big time!
Kylie Jenner bought one and had it painted purple for Travis Scott.  Not really.. but F the Kardashians and the Jenners too.  High five?
its ugly
Straighten the velcro on that umbrella you god damn monster
You can get those same rising speakers in an Audi A4... this car is so damn overpriced haha
Looks like a Passat.
The glass brick is actually made out of sapphire.
Million dollar Ford fusion. Lmao!!!!
This car is sad overpriced AF dad joke for a grandpa.
If I had to buy one I would be extremely surprised if it was more than 150000$
Designed exclusively for the oil 🛢  sheikhs
This car is just a waste of money. Did not like it at all
Looks like a black matted 2002 Civic.
I love the glass between the side windows but they missed an opportunity to stick some LEDs under there.
funny you mentioned Ford Taurus. It looks like a concept of a Ford Taurus
How many of these were made for other planets?
The orange on the inside reminds me of the Yugo GV. Can't do it.
There are cheaper ways to look like a complete idiot. What a gopping piece of metal
The front grille looks like a new G 90 Genesis only not as aggressive.
This may be the most overpriced vehicle Ive ever seen....
This car is beautiful but still overpriced, you get more features AND a better overall look in a Phantom which is half the price WITH options
1 mil for circles and buttons
This is the video we know Doug has sold out.
It is made for fooling middleastern theifs, who steal the people's money and buy bullshit cars
“They only made 120” ... 120 x 1,000,000... not a bad business lol.
I'm not gonna lie but the climate control area looks really cheap in the back seats.
1.26  some serious paint correction needed
Nice audio system.
this guy must have been in paradise when he got his first Starship Enterprise. He get into WOWS over biuts of glass and cute placement of sidelights. This car is fine but it's made in UK .
Ps most of theses so called expensive technology on theses elite cars will be applied to all vehicles,because most cars today are so controlled you have to have a expensive scam tool(scan tool) to reprogram a simple replacement part.
Lol 3 million dollars for a car thats not bullet proof or nothing to different from it just looks nice form the outside but when you shake the tree you see why on earth would I spend 3 million for a car that  is limited in self  maintains I'm not talking about this car but most at this price range evening the h1 hummer has a useful options.
Show off without being a show off. A rare car for a rare kind of driver.
No one can matches the luxury of rolls ... Even Bentley
It is crap against phantom... I am not gonna pay 1 million dollars for beauty..... It's just a crap....🙄
I must have missed it, did Doug mention how much this car costs?😜
OVERPRICED by about $900K
only  stupid people will buy this car is uae 🇦🇪 too much money 💰 no brain 🧠
10:20 "It is very nice feature and very luxurious. It's nice piece of attention to detail from the Taraf." Miata got the same feature. :D
Not a million dollar car but I definitely think it is beautiful. That matte black paint is also such a nice color for it
This shit doesn't even worth 100k$
He said it’s the price  of two rolls Royce phantom’s I would rather have both of them  than this shitty ass sedan
It seems that been paid some money to say some good wards about this garbage and ugly car, Dog you are liar
There is a car more expensive it’s made by Rolls Royce. It’s the Sweptail and it’s price was 13 Million. It was a one of a kind.
10:00. No it won't. As demonstrated.  11:47 For $1M, that finishing is atrocious.
No way if I had a million dollars I would buy this car....much rather a really high end Brabus for that much!
It really is drop dead gorgeous but is it just me or does the front-end kind of look like a Ford Taurus from like the 2010s
When they say taraf they mean torath wich means heritage in arabic
The only reason this car been created because tax purpose
Frond end looks like the new ram 1500
Nobody: Doug: These tires are so luxurious I’ve seen nothing like this before
Bro I don’t know what your smoking but this is the ugliest car I’ve ever seen
That is a truly gorgeous car.
Looks like a Honda Accord from the front and you call it "The Most Beautiful Car"!? its not worth a million dollars at all! The way he is presenting the car, clearly shows that he's being paid to do this review.
Sure the car might be beautiful from the exterior and Some parts of the interior and I'm not rich to criticize it but the features are very outdated or at least they look like it. I mean you can look how the screen looks, its so thicc and so ugly, I actually expected a curved and very thin amoled display not this crap borrowed from a gameboy. The looks are no doubt beautiful but damn, it doesn't have any features even the simplest one that a car of this price should have like even an accord comes with apple car play or android. The price would be reasonable if it was some classic but this is a 2018 car in 2020 and only 2 years old and I forgot about the steering wheel LMAO which already looks like from the 90s and reminds me what maserati did in 2017 with it's interior.
Sorry Doug, even the Peugeot 508 looks better.. for way less money.
That interior is embarrassing! $1 MIL and it comes with that cheesy Garmin GPS glued to the dash board? In 2018?! HELL NO!
Wait what model year is this
"this will be owned by someone with exquisite taste" what a load of bull..
Props to Aston Martin for being able to sell this car for twice as much as a RR. I don't see much difference from this to an older version of Genesis G90, which is way more affordable. If this is the most beautiful sedan Doug has ever seen, I will not trust his scores anymore when it comes to design.
Why would Doug buy a car that would end up at a repair shop soon.  Talk about 🔥 money
WE GET IT!  It's got a lagonda  badge not Aston Martin. ITS COOOL. -_-
All I can say is meh
My dad would always make bitch to me about throwing my stuff in the trunk. He would say quit your gonna break the fridge. I always would be like leave me alone. Fucking parents just dont get it.
Lagonda taraf is another way to say you are poor in rich language
million-dollar-twenty-foot-long!
Dougs T-shirt has a T-shirt collection.
Doug saw the price tag now he don’t know how to act
Parallel parking this thing though.
Think I just found the most useless car for the money... it's this or just set a million dollars on fire I guess...
Doug: If you want to make this even more kid friendly... Me: My sticky fingered, cheetoed mouth, milk spilling, crumb leaving, wild child 5-year-old will be walking while I enjoy my iPad from the backseat while I'm chauffeured to his school . Speaking for every mom everywhere, save yourselves 1M , buy a ford fusion, Honda accord and Dodge Charger and piece it together yourself . ✌
I came here just to find out why I should buy this car instead of two Rolls Royces
Looks a lot like the Emperor's new clothes to me!  Kind of ho hum for $1M.
How do people not realize this car isn't new or compare it to present day cars. It's came out for the 2014-15 year  2015-2016
James Bond decided to put off "dying another day" and hang himself after he saw this.
are this is the most beautiful sedan you ever see ?? are you sure about that major statement !!!!
Taraf doesn't mean ultimate luxury in Arabic 😬
I’ve never seen a million dollar car I hated so much, the tech, navigation system, controls, dash is SO from the past, I hope they never sell this car to the dumbest rich egghead in America, this is the biggest scam car ever...
For one million$ it still can't drive its self.
It looks like CHEETAH from VICE CITY
Imagine buying this over a brand new Rolls Royce
..cmon Doug........really?.......
That is one huge and long car!
Wow flat black for 1 million dollars, what a fuckin joke
How tf is Doug always on his knees on cement?? My knees would be killing me, but it’s almost natural for Doug. 😏😭
Looks like a modern Dacia 1300 😂😂. Nothing special for 1M bucks
Car looks nice from front on but ugly as hell from the side
The original lagonda and the Lamborghini Countach made me a car nut.
No panoramic sunroof?
It's not trash it's "Strange"
Most ugliest million dollar car. interior is trash, exterior is meh  Doug are you becomeing a sellout, did you get paid for this, this isn't 2010 its 2020, its a decade behind for a million dollar car
3:39
Looks like a Jaguar XJS
''This is the most beautiful sedan ever made'' doug what are you smoking 😂
Why would you ever choose this over  Phantom thats 2 times cheaper than this outdated pile of shit 😂
Did Aston do Partnership with Honda, Ford and dodge too?
Doug, I’m sorry but anything you say from now on will not be taken seriously.
Car's f_ckin' ugly for the price...
Lambo does high end one offs, for wealthy clients. Fabios got one...
Doug can't express it fully, through a video. Every line on that car is PERFECT.
that key hole is bothering me
6:22 if the Audi R8 and bmw i8 had a baby
it looks like a Hyundai...
This channel is obviously of interest to men. HAIR LOSS is also a topic of major interest to MEN so go to www.BornAgainHair.com and learn about a NEW science which explains that the main cause of HAIR LOSS is not DHT but a blockage of BLOOD FLOW caused by a tight LOWER scalp layer called the GALEA. This causes a low OXYGEN condition called HYPOXIA and this then causes DHT to be over-produced and only then the DHT becomes the “ killer ” of hair. Normally DHT is good for proper hair growth and all male characteristics, so screwing around with reducing DHT is a BAD idea because it has serious consequences like ...IMPOTENCE.   The OLD methods have failed because they focus only on DHT and not on the MAIN cause...which is the disruption of the BLOOD FLOW to the scalp..." layman's logic ".  This new method has over 28,500 members all over the world with a success rate of more than 95% and uses no drugs, no lotions and no surgery.
Oh, the plastic A/C outlet in the rear is a wart on the face of this car. Inexcusable.
Or buy a nice new s-class, two new ferraris, 2 new luxury pickups, a new porsche 911 turbo and two tesla beaters  Alternatively, swap one of the ferraris for a respectable single family home in the midwest.  Eh, still super cool. Probably anyone who buys one already has a dozen of everything else lol!
Incredibly stupid car lol
The refrigerator button is straight out of Mercedes parts bin
الله يرزقنا
This car is so bad, so poorly designed, so lacking in integrity I’m reconsidering.. in fact hesitant to buy any other car from Aston Martin or even anything they manufacture even if it were a pen.
That is impressive and very well designed. Timeless lines
Yeah if it doesn’t have apple CarPlay I’m not paying more than $15,500
No one in NA would spend so much on something so ugly.  Edit: I actually lost respect for Aston Martin as a whole brand after seeing this car and even lost some respect for Doug for considering this the most “beautiful” sedan he ever seen.
10/10 for design? kek design is shit
thissss is a dewbauchee exemplar
The proper way to pronounce it's name is (Trf) not Taraf
Fun fact. That refrigerator is from Mercedes
one million?? I think the car should give you a score
Imagine losing that unique ash tray. I bet the car value goes down by 50k without the ash tray lol
Very expensive! :)
Isn't Aston Martin owned by Stroll now?
I would rather pay 1 million dollars for a highly optioned RR Phantom
Aluminum is not magnetic
Dougs points go up with price of the car , definitely not the most beautiful car Doug .
Absolutely beautiful  The Maserati Quatroporte used to be my favorite sedan..now its #2
Wtf he is saying the most beautiful car?isn't he overreacting for few bucks.
It looks like an up-market model made by a mass-producer in the early 1990s, but has been neglected and the paint has faded. Totally fail to see why it can be considered inspiringly beautiful. It isn't ugly at all, but is bland. And matte paint is a going to be very passé very soon.
You should review the new Mercedes S-Class. It will wipe the floor with this car.
What a useless car.
Sorry slapping a million dollar price tag does not make this worth a million dollars. This is worth $180K tops.
🤔Who or what inspired the Volvo V90 design😮
Every tesla has the piece of glass between the 2 doors...
This car is horrible
interesting
Hey Doug what kind of umbrella Insurance do you carry for these dealership to allow you to drive these cars because we all know there's no way you're going to take personal responsibility if you wreck a million-dollar car
Kinda got the same key slot situation in our vw cc.
Wow, what a stunning looking car.  Kind of need to get off the oil though, thats the problem with this motor.  At least make a Hybrid, oil burners are becoming the NOT to buy thing at present.
weird looking honda accord....
Ford Fusion 2
Its ugly to me.. sorry doug
Honda, Toyota, and Nissan launched their upscale luxury divisions back in the 1980s: Acura, Lexus, and Infiniti, respectively. Nice to see that Aston Martin finally has an upscale luxury division as well.
I think even Floyd Mayweather would vomit.
will you review an ALPINA B7?:)
Bruh this looks exactly like the polestar one or should I say the polestar one looks exactly like this
Surely they didn't sell any of these. This is honestly embarrassing for the brand. It's an uglier Rapide for 10 times the money. It looks like a kit car as well.
Umm no... This is a billionaire toy.
Nothing beats the Contental GT V8
Guess who isn’t buying it? Mee!
After watching he whole video, I still don’t understand why this car is worth one million dollars🥴
I must take issue with this car being the most beautiful car.  It okay but can't touch the Citroen Metropolis.  Please do a review of it.  Thanks! https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&ccid=460IwUEJ&id=4B6452B712D35022353B235B19FBF4D0BC8991BC&thid=OIP.460IwUEJkuoA-p5Sdkrt2QHaE7&mediaurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.extravaganzi.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2010%2f05%2fCitroen-Metropolis-26.jpg&exph=853&expw=1280&q=Citroen+Metropolis&simid=608046882598291282&ck=BB763B5E8C182C8E3048E89516F707DE&selectedIndex=4&FORM=IRPRST&ajaxhist=0
Seatbelt locks have foreskins? Bruh..
looks exactly same as the link ahahahahaah https://www.zbrushcentral.com/t/studying-animals/351946
I never heard of this car
Per typical of Aston Martin, they are the most beautiful cars on earth, BUT they cut every other corner on ALL of their cars. ALL of the "luxury touches" seen here in this video can be had in a $100k Audi, Mercedes, or BMW. That Bang & Olufson system that raises up out of the dash is straight out of the 2018 Audi A8. This was made for the Middle East monarchs, clearly, who only care about things that nobody else has just to say they have one and you don't.
It’s crazy how cars like a VW Jetta R-Line or a Toyota Corolla XSE have better gauge clusters and infotainment than this
Lol even phantom costs around 2 million in India and Singapore.
Mazda grill :) very Mazda like car, just with a bigger engine which breaks faster.
looks like a modern version of alfa 166
Waste my time and waste my money if I've got the money people buy that they have got 'mental problem' !
The Aston Martin rapide looks wayyy better
The 2022 genesis g100
is this a joke? because this is an ugly disgusting car, from inside and outside
Ford Mondeo fifth generation.
The backend looks like Rami Malek's mouth.
A Million dollars for a outdated looking GPS (Garmin) system ? LoL and the back seats looks nice but No reclining seats...Also LoL. The designer of the Lagonda Taraf needs  to go back and rethink this car. There are luxury cars now that puts this car to shame in terms of the items i just mentioned and the price is less than 300K i'm not a designer and I could have don't way better with putting in the necessary luxury items in the Million dollar range type customers.
A nice $200k car.
i just skipped to dougscore and was surprised by 10 in design. like wtf
Buying a 180.000$ m760li way better then this aston fusion😅
Buying this Car is not wise at all. Why not buy 143 in total number of $7,000 2008 Toyota Avalon which will cost about a million and give it to 143 single mothers/fathers that really needs a car to take the kids to school. If not buying them cars, just donate $7,000 to single mothers/fathers that really needs it, and see how much blessing you will receive from God.
If it wasn't made for not American, why dose it have a left hand drive?
Sometimes I wonder why Britain has no regular car industry. Then I remember Britain now makes a £1,000,000 saloon
I jist wanna like this car and it shouldnt be like that with it being 1 mill
Flat black paint?  Yuck.
I liked the Jaguar XJL, you reviewed earlier, better...and a lot cheaper.
WHERE IS THE BRONCO
anyone notice the clank at  24:16? did he just scratch the paint with a rock flying off the wheel?!  OMG it happened again at 25:00.  lol theres something wrong with the car.. at a million dollars. Even my 20k acura MDX doesnt clank when I turn the steering wheel
Yeah, I wouldn't call it beautiful but whatever
If it was sold in the British market, it would have MPH also.
Did anyone count how many times Doug said Lagonda / Taraf in the whole review? :-)
It’s basically a very overpriced 4 door Aston. Would rather have a Panamera Turbo any day over this.
Me: Very cheap interior very ugly exterior that doesn't even deserve a 50k !  Doug: This is the most beautiful sedan in the world !! Aston Martin : Yeah we payed him well 🙂
How much did they pay you Doug ? come on man this car doesn't deserve even a 100 k for it's normal look !
Wow, that design is going to look so dated in a few years
For that kinda money, there should be no plastic parts inside the car.. Did he say ford stock!!  for a million bucks, i want gold  trims!!!
I‘m sorry I think it’s ugly. The proportions seem off. The technology is underwhelming. Who would pay that amount of money for that? Buy a Rolls Royce Special edition or something but that
So Aston Martin IS capable of making an ugly car!
That's one ugly boat
Can't be a 2018 model as production ended in December 2016. Perhaps it was first registered in the USA in 2018. Also Ford sold AML in 2007, a full seven years before this was debuted at the Geneva Motor Show, so the presence of any Ford parts, if indeed there are, must be for some other reason.
$1,000,000 and they give it the astonishingly outdated 2005 interior and infotainment system. no wonder they want to sell it in the Middle East, only Arabs can get an erection from too much leather, useless bling and outrageously exaggerated price tag. any typical S-Class let alone a Bentley is by far more luxurious and modern
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWUjTSbsksk  I would assume this car is honestly more worth it in terms of pricing than the Lagonda Taraf.
WHY WOULD A PERSON PAY $1M DOLLARS FOR A LUXURY CAR THAT DOESN'T EVEN OFFER MASSAGE FUNCTIONS NOR AMBIENT LIGHTING???
the grill looks like a mix between a nissan maxima and a ford fusion
Look like a freaking Hyundai !!!!!!!
Its nice, not a $1,000,000 nice, It just lacks features, a Rolls Royce and Bentley have wayy more to offer, sometimes at a fraction of the price, honestly the only reason why the pricing on this thing is as high as it is, is exclusivity, same reason why people pay so much for Gucci and  Louis Vuitton, to the right buyer, this is probably worth it, to the majority though, this thing is just featureless and over priced for what it is
i agree beautiful
Ba la noi taraful se ascultă nu se conduce.
That's way too much money for a name my ls500 has similar features and it miles away cheaper
So a car for spoilt Arab princes who have more oil than sense? Yeh, this car is as out of touch as Pluto is to Earth.
Definitely not worth 1M. It’s like any other higher end sedan just with a drink cooler
Is it just me that sees a ford mondeo from the front
My 16 Mercedes S550 Coupe looks better and aside from the V12 has more going for it.  No LCD screens in the driver dash?  Small pop-up screen in the center dash?  Other than the seats, key and V12, not impressed.  Why am I inserting a key in the dashboard?  No push to start?  I guess you'll have to always have to keep the key separate from your regular keys.
1 million and you get fuckin ipads really?
Taraf means literally nothing in arabic
Imagine paying over a million for a fuckin aston martin lmao
Nice Ford Fusion V12
Trying to work out is this the greatest  Troll video. This was a quick smash and grab for that middle east oil money so blatant they didn't want to name it an Aston Martin. This car is for the  type of people who wrap their other cars Gold and apparently have no taste. Here in England as i'm sure the Chief execs at  Aston Martin we call such customers Mugs.
25:00 yea, this is nothing more than a pretty status symbol
Nice car, nice review. But Doug, have you ever wear long trousers?
Looks like a Ford fusion from the front...
Is that a Ford Fusion? It could have fooled me
how can a million dollar car get a 7 in quality?
This door trick... a Honda Civic does that
Sweet looking Dodge Dart limo conversion.
Often disagree in terms of design with Doug, but this thing... damn, that IS really beautiful!  Of course I wouldnt buy it, well, okay, maybe if I had a 250 million plus dollar... :D
Definitely NOT worth $1 million.., and you should dress properly when doing SUPER luxury vehicles.
He refers to this car as if it was built in the Stone Age
can someone make me a millionair pls
Looks like a gta car
Lamborghini Aventador J Review by Mohammed Aryan https://youtu.be/JUQHmrUXxOk
Nice Jaguar. :-P I got bored half way through and left.
the shape of this car is identical to my asian water monitors head, lmfao
this car looks like a dodge charger with more defined lines
I kept thinking this is a 2010 model year and it still barely makes sense, until I went back to the beginning to check again it's a 2018. I have a feeling that Doug likes this car solely because of the price tag...
there are 2 types of people in this world: those who are trustworthy, and those who evaluate design of a $1m car wearing dark ugly hiking boots with white socks 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Doug the type of guy to start every video with the word “This”
The doors stay where you put them! For 1 million the doors better blow me too.
Gorgeous car. Absolute four door perfection. But that rear end/rear quarter area/gas filler is very reminiscent of a 1969 Dodge Charger just a bit shorter.
and then the Lucid Air exists too... so whats the point of this thing?
Remember this car was geared toward the Middle East and Europe. Aston Martin knew better to never sell this car in North America because Aston Martin has no history here in North America. Europe and the Middle East does have history with them though.
The front looks like a Dodge Charger, Honda Accord, and a Ford Fusion went 3 halves on a baby. 👶
this is not even luxurious than the 2019 benz s class
At exactly 14:42 on this video it gives me the creeps...
The headlights look like they're from a Taurus
This is ugly
It doesnt have that much features as it costs
Why didn't he mention the paint???!!
https://youtu.be/XUmjYkODF3Y?t=625 somehow the door closes with a sound not at all for a million 🤣 Arabs, disperse, you got f.cked. pay attention to bmw or mercedes. There are 99 pieces left in aston martin stock that they could not sell? Doug, you can probably buy a new kia from the money for this under-advertisement 🤣.
$120m for 120 performance luxury cars like this is not enough to pay for the development.  Hence the parts bin assortment and a lethargic ~500HP.  An E60 M5 well maintained would be way more a car!
Price is more than rolls Royce but it can't compare with rolls Royce
Looks like an elongated European muscle car
18:27 I'd like to see doug blasted in the face by the pop up sprinkler here
It's not just ugly, it might also be one of the most overpriced cars ever made. For that much money nothing should be off the shelf part from a fucking Ford Focus. Some interior elements wouldn't look out of place on some cheap Hyundai. Pathetic effort from Aston.
And you don't have adjustable headrest, what a cheap way!
Seems like he got paid to say he loves it, because the dealerships in the hole with that car and needs its sold😂😂😂
Must be one of those cars that looks good in person, this video does it 0 justice
Crap Doug. It’s not that good. Sorry.
One $ million is too overpriced. Price gouging. It’s worth $200 k at most.
https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/distinctive
Trashest car award goes to this 💩 crap
Find someone to let you drive a 288gto.  Also the best looking 4 door is a panther body.  That's right. I said it.  Also 4 doors look bad.  Also also... Capless fuels system? So a 8 year old base model fiesta?
The Audi S8 is much cheaper and more beautiful.
I’m sorry sir but there’s no way in hell that this car is that amazing to be worth 1 million .. it looks like a nice sedan with extra luxuries and that’s it ... nothing fancy in my book
Not even worth$35,000
No sunroof?
I didn't understand this review honestly
🤮
From front view this looks like Ford Fusion. I guess for $1M you can make any Ford Fusion look like this Aston Martin. And the budge on the front bumper looks like Chrysler logo and the one on the rear bumper resembles Chevrolet logo.
Agree that it looks just like a GTA car. Very generic and quite bland. The price was just comical :P Whoever paid that much for this must have been crazy :P It just follows the basic brittish recipe for lyxury - just cover it in leather! :P
Whats the Cow to Lagonda ratio?
People have mentioned the accord.  It also looks like Hyundai Genesis, lmao.
This car would be nice if it was $30K and released in 2007
Covered in Leather and matte black? For the Middle East? Hmmm...
Mercedes s Class has 100 more amazing features than lagonda...... why this car is 1 million dollars ???
Leonardo de Caprio : Selll me this car.  Dough: It has leather.
Doug, I’m only here to say, the front grill is not distinct. It looks like a Ford Fusion.
Doug sounds like a salesman in this review!
one word - overpriced !!!
Bs review...       I'm disappointed Doug...
Typically Aston Martin: self-overestimated and overpriced.
this is definately worth it depending on how many cows they kills for 100 cars
Only car with seatbelt buckles that have foreskin
by the way,, (Taraf) is an Arabic word means Luxury
this car is worth $1,000,000 because there’s a $900,000 diamond encrusted in the dashboard.
front is ford mondeo
Doug the type of guy to use a high amount I couldn't help but hello to them sir I couldn't help but see if there was a big style of it.
My S Class does a lot of this including the door placement!
noway in hell thats the best looking car ever
Gas struts probably aren't that expensive
That engine is as big as the half of my car.
Nice but no a cool mil worthy
Doug, no horn?  A Lagonda review with no horn?  That's a $500,000 choice.
Aaaaaaand a million dollars gets you an extra 10 inches of leg room, a foot and a half of extra body and oh yeah 2 pieces of glass between the doors 😂
I love it but doesn’t shout $1m
This thing sucks
everyone dislikes this car that daddy doug loves and he dislikes the front of the senna which everyone loves
Say Lagonda one more time Doug! SAY IT AGAIN! I DARE YOU!
Think they could have come up with a better name
Looks like a Dodge Charger and a Ford Taurus had a kid
The BMW 7 Series doors are the same, you can set the door any width.  Can't rememberer what they call it though
hes so excited talking about the interior as if he never reviewed a Maybach
then you compare its interior to the interior of 5 times less expensive Maybach...
*then you compare its interior to the interior of 5 times less expensive Maybach*
No wonder this was only planned for Middle East. Only someone stupid and rich enough from Oil money would ever consider buying this.
Oh nice, it's got isofix.
The most beautiful car imo. if i was a billionaire i would buy it immediately.
Looks like a Honda accord
I can't keep seeing this horrible car.
Es el carro más feo que e visto!
It looks like a honda accord knock off :|
Wow paying a 1mill for a car with no inbuilt tvs like benz does pretty disappointing
This looks like an overpriced 2018 ford Taraf I mean Taurus.
At last, there have some cars that I can proud and to showed off to RR owner.
looks like a honda accord
Ugly just like the other Lagonda.
Notice how Doug is digging on Tyler's car? :-)
I don’t get it. But hey, if you get some asshole prince to buy one- props.
Amazing nice car.  But, when it breaks, who will fix it?
I think Aston missed an opportunity here to bring back suicide doors
Aston Martin: Wraps up everything in leather Also Aston Martin: Give me $1 million....
27:43 I feel attacked
My PT Cruiser convertible does that thing with the window dropping down when you open it. QUIRKY!
Add this to my list of cars I'd never buy even if I had all the money in the world. It includes any of the supercar/hypercar based on a regular model with a bodykit and a new name with 5x the price. I'm looking at Bugatti, Pagani, Lamborghini, etc.
It's looks like if honda accord and dodge challenger had a baby
This car does not say 1 million dollars, there's nothing stunning about it. In fact, the styling is as boring as the Toyota Camry.
This car's side profile looks like they mashed up a challenger and a 300c. Its so UGLY and extremely american.
Man this car is ugly
Dear Doug for million dollar I can buy house($450k) Mercedes s class ($140k) Ford raptor 70k and still save 340k
Doug love your videos but can you please show the interior of all the cars you review a little slower so we can see a little better other than that your the best bro
Glad to see everyone else in the comments thinks that this car is extremely ugly too given the outrageous price. It would still be overpriced at 40k. It almost seems like this car's existence and price is one big publicity stunt.
The price is what makes people like this car, Only a new money or someone with  third world mentality would love it
This car is such a scam. It lacks so many features a fucking base s class offers. A rolls royce smokes this overpriced Aston Martin in every regard, for literally half the price and just as much prestige.
I wouldn't buy this for 80 grand
You can't magnetize aluminum
Who the hell bought this car for $1million?? This is a $200 000 car with extra leather.
🤢🤮
Lots of foolish rich people in the ME who need to be relieved of their money ...........
OOF, i'm sorry but the front looks like these girls doing ''duck face'' or whatever the fuck the call it for photos. @6:22  i can't unsee that.
lmao
ugly side profile
Dougs here doing Test Drive Unlimited in is real life
If you are thinking is it worth it, you probably can't buy it. EVER. . . . . . . . That includes me as well!
Genesis looks better
How and why does it not have tinted windows, I don't get the design decision to not have tinted windows.
10:25, Mmm, sounds like a door from ONE MILLION dollars car, nice
V12  and then leather -maybe that’s why it’s  a mil.  Idk
I'd change the Lagonda badge to Genesis for trolling purpose.
Doug has THE WORST taste in cars. This hot mess lols luke a smashed crab 🦀 will be worth $50k in three years 😂
Honestly I’d take a phantom over this all day irrespective of the price tag
It’s a solid $50k luxury sedan. Once out of warranty forget it!!! Doug says, “ I’ll try and sell it for ya” !!
The one million dollar rip-off is what it is. Exterior is beautiful, but not nearly as e38. The interior is so underwhelming for $1 mil it's making me sad...
This is the most beautiful sedan in the world indeed 😍
i don't get it
great looking car. maybe not the no 1, but easily on my top10-list
mmmm... I personally prefer Mercedes S Class Maybach or Rolls Phantom... Too much leather and the detailed of the non-dedicated tablets (meaning it's just a gadget to put your Ipad what you get) make this car a no for me...  PS: anyway I could not afford it so anyway :)
This car is for money laundry.
This car really deserves a much more critical review. It is such a trap - simply made to get money from people who don’t care about WHAT they buy but only want to have whatever is most expensive. Every S coupe, Bentley and Rolls is way better. Rubbish car - styling put aside
It looks ks like ford  fat fusion
Finally, a tasteful luxury interior design, that doesn't resemble a nightclub. And yes, the design is one of the best in automobile history.  Many of the commenters here have no taste, apparently.
I guess doug is not as smart as I thought.
WOW, what a complete disappointment this sedan is! I was expecting a lot more given the the inflated price tag. Overall features, aesthetics, technology and engine specs, are very underwhelming.
He is still wearing 2 shirts even in summer.
let's now review the Aston Martin one 77
Honest title: The Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf is the World's Most Boring, Overpriced and Lazy Luxury Sedan  turn signal from a Ford? Dafuq?! You sell it for a million bucks make a damn turn signal.
Beautiful Styling... From the side profiles its a dodge charger rear with an accord front mashed together
Came here from your 80's Lagonda and I still feel the same...what a truly unremarkable overpriced piece of shit.  At least the 80's Lagonda looked oddly cool in ways that this Lagonda does not.
https://youtu.be/O3OqGyqxIvI
Rather buy an AMG S65 sedan
Looks like a futuristic Ford Taurus. No thanks. For a million u can keep it
If I had money I would have purchased the S class 2019. The 2020 S class is just absolute shit in terms of design
Im not too crazy about this car's styling....I thought the 02' Vanquish was the most beautiful Aston Martin ever made 😒
The door opens and closes ! how amazing ?
Lame design , looks like a 90's Lnacia
Do a centanario review, realised ad at the beginning
$1 million.  What a rip off. This is just not worth anything like that sort of money.
wouldnt spend that much money on that!!  am arab and this is an insult for the word Taraf :D
I'd rather buy Audi A8
Doug's hand gestures.. I can just see what he's doing when he's doing them lol. The funny thing is, normally his body gestures are fast and twitchy.. which means, he decided to do those slow gestures, thinking he's being real "pro" lmao. Doug is the ultimate dork and I love it.
I think you’re getting “car drunk”!!🤣 like when you see a rich & famous, good looking actor with someone everyone else sees as kinda ugly or, fashion models that are UGLY yet, the photographer screams “Oh, So Gorgeous”! 🤣🤣🤣
The interior leather is hideous. It looks like an NFL FOOTBALL!!🤮 A lighter color would’ve looked MUCH BETTER!!
its not more luxurious than a german cars🤦🏻‍♂️
So, you're telling me that you can't charge the iPads while they're in the holders?! Nope, definitely would not buy  Wow, so AM made a cool $120 million out of this? Nice
Lagonda is Aston Martin's luxury brand ...because Aston Martin aren't luxurious at all so they had to make it uglier?
0:44 what's that?
This review was paid by Aston Martin
So much for the Rear Seat Getting Head Room with that center console.
Is it just me or does the front look a bit like a ford taurus?
That car is democrat butt ugly
Repair cost for the navigation is 80K.
Does this car come with 800K cash in the trunk?
Depreciation is 300K a year.
2021 genesis g81
What a waste of a million dollars.
9:45 Doug says no matter where you put it, the door will stay that way. 10:02 the door falls lol
10:02  "Door will stay exactly there"  xD
Wow.Compared to the new S Class this looks like dog shit
Imagine being so stupid to burn a million dollars on a car built from another car that costs 40,000 dollars..!!  What is even stupid is that it has the same specifications, technology and interior color and steering wheel from the rapide!!!!! And the information screen is very old and its not touch  screen either!!!  What is even is this ¡¡¡¡ Its soooo stupid i can't imagine 😂😂😂😂😂
Front looks like VW Jetta. Overall a bland look. Doug sees it as the most beautiful car though.
I don't see anything beautiful in this car sorry.
Looks pretty boring like a linoln and a hyundai had a baby
Omg this car was brain numbingly boring 🤦🏻‍♂️ come on Doug.
smirking at the rolls next to you as you click your cheap plastic ford blinker stalk.... oh yea that’s luxury
1mil dollar car... Hmmm how about the cup holders? Are they firm n sturdy? Can it hold my mcdonald drinks firmly?
In Arabic you pronounce it ta'ruff
Come on boys and girls, the man got to eat too, and he have many cars to nourish !
The more I look at it the duller it gets
What a stupid paint job
what a review!
THISSSS
Im pretty sure a $69k E class is better than this
The weirdest looking 4 door sedan. The tail looks like some unfinished business.
So a 80.000  Maserati Ghibli is overpriced, but this Lagonda Taraf which isn't much different from a Quattroporte sounds logic at 1 million.  This exterior looks kind of similar to a Genesis G90 or Volvo S90. The grill is bad designed 'cause i'm able to see the radiator (horrible), it is missing the bonnet ornament (something a high-end sedan MUST have),  a Maybach S500 has more comfort in the rear seats, is has a good amount of that horrible black plastic that no matter how much you clean is always dirty, etc...  The Quattroporte has a FERRARI V6 3.8L 523 Hp, tht "Taraf" with 800K more uses a  $%#$ FORD!!!! engine!, that despite having 5.9L reach just 17HP more (540HP). And I suppose the handling is not as good.   But for Dough this is better just because it has tousshhhcreen in the back and says Lagundaaa.  Come on! if there is an overvalued car is this one.   If somebody wants to spend one million better bought a Quattroporte, a Phantom, a Flying Spur, a Willis MB and there is still money for an ice cream.
kind of looks like a ford fusion in front
Boring car.
How much did they pay you to praise the "beauty" of this overpriced and quite dull looking vehicle?
no ventilated seats, no table, no window shade, no massaging seats, you get more option in a 2015 ford escape, you pay a million bucks for a bunch of leather. lame as fuck . The Bentley continental GT looks better, is cheaper, better equipped. I see no reason to consider this car would you be wealthy enough to buy it
Price broken down:  -$75,000 to Aston Martin -$925,000 to Lawrence Stroll Executive Chairman
Lafonda? Oh he said Lagonda.
I think I’m the only person that actually paid attention to the video and to Doug, and really understand that this is supposed to be a different type of car. It is a sedan that has a really low and long shape, being agressive and elegant at the same type. Not so much imposing like, people are comparing it with bentleys and rolls royces but it’s just different. The price is from the low unities number (being an exclusive car). They did this design for only 150 unities. I really think it isn’t worth 1 million dollars, but is any car worth more than 100k? Worth is subjective
The car looks good, just shit features. Looks better than a Royce in my opinion. They just fucked up and got lazy with the interior after giving the car a whole bunch of leather.
This ain’t worth it at al.. maybe $250k
there are some bad design flaws that my wv polo from 2006 does not have! not to mention the fact that you have to charge your own ipads in your million dollar car!
1m dollar car, has the key lock on the door! wtf?
I miss the kind of videos where doug used to drive his aston on a frozen lake and salt flats, crush a chrysler with his hummer and tried to see how much attention he gets in his ferrari. Now its mostly just auto reviews.
10:15 all tractors have these 😂😂😂😂
Apart from the stitching, I see no luxury here.
Do somebody remember this car named Quarz regilia in forza 3 it looks much more nicer
This car shouldn't even be worth 200k
You know what! Buy a Phantom and a Rapide
I prefer to buy a S63 amg
THISSS is how you you waste 1 million dollars.
To be honest Phantom is more value for money when compared to this leather wrapped crap
the taillight turn signal color change thing has been in almost every Audi since 2018 lol
Doug: "This car had a sticker price of around $1,000,000"  Me: *checks to see if my headphones are broken*
NOT WORTH ONE MILLION DOLLARS
bro why do Americans talk so much, I don't need an explanation of every single thing I can clearly see
Car's come via the UK with that station on the radio (Talksport over DAB). Got to be fun parking something that length in London!
Is doug geting paid to kiss aston's ass?
2020 Mazda 6 wanna be...oops
The worst  car
Woah! What did they do with the GOOD Aston Martin designers from the late 90s and early 2000s?  This thing is hideous!  The original Lagonda actually looks better!  This thing looks like a bastardized Ford Taurus or Fusion... Wait no... That would be insulting to the Ford "rent a car" lines.
This is car this short where Doug needs to kneel next to it?
Front grill-lights assembly reminds me of the Aston Martin badge
Meh...
you. commenters. need. to calm. down.
Not worth the money at all.. that little navigation system was laughable
its make a lot of sense if you ask me , because nobody is stupid enough to buy this overpriced piece of shit , except in middle east though .
Basically a BMW 7 series for a million dollars
Hay 2 Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf en el Subcontinente NorteAmericano, y de hecho el primero en arribar está en México, es color blanco perlado y su dueño es conocido en Instagram como @donhuayra, el segundo en llegar fue este, de color negro mate.
Looks like a gran theft auto car
Looks like a overpriced Gta V car. Ugly design.
Genesis look better than this on the inside.
Dash and head unit look like 2002.. 1 mil for that no thanks..
Looks like an acura to me lol
Wanna see the Transporter drive one in a car chase.
This doesnt even come close to the mercedes S-Class that costs 10 times less. Theres nothing special about this car. I even thought they were gonna come with a new dashboard. Please dont compare it to Rolls coz it doesnt even come close to mercedes S-Class. What a waste of money
Hissssss voice is toooooooo annoying to continue watching
This has to be the most boring million dollar car in existence. The umbrella is held in the trunk with velcro, and its marketed to a country that never has rain.
$1 MIL for some fancy leather & magnets
Not impressed with this car at all for the price.
Front: Ford Fusion ✅ Sides: Honda Accord ✅ Back: Chevy Camaro ✅
Panamera doors do the same "hold anywhere" feature and higher headroom in the back...for way less than a million
I was a long time subscriber to this channel but that's over now thanks to THISSSS Abortion of a Car review. Sold out big time.
27:44 Dial down that sas Doug 😂
I would love to see the atmosphere behind the camera,   Aston martin people holding snipers in their hands and pointing at Doug's head, and if he said the word "But....", bamm, that's my guess,   He is really trying hard to justify the unjustified 1 million dollar price tag!
It is ungodly ugly!
Long story short, a crap car not worth the money by a mile
Aston Martin's company name is actually 'Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings plc' which is why their UK cars have AML license plates
Honda Accord Lite
This review was *definitely* paid for by the dealership. Seriously, this thing has less features than a $75k Hyundai and yet it costs twice the amount of a fully loaded Rolls Royce. So stupid...
This is almost comedy
a 2018 car with a 2009 entertainment/nav system
What is the...'this era crap' ???   It is from 2018. It isn't a 2001!  And $1M still gets you cheap ass plastic bumpers and a huge plastic grill.  That's very UK luxury....not. The rear seats have all that room because if you spending this kind of money on a sedan, and live in the  UAE, you have a chauffeur. The driver can be cramped, but you have to spread out, as you get  blown, oh I mean.....driven.
This car is not worth a million dollar. Ugly old design, performance suck. People pay for the name of it!!!
Honestly, not pretty at all, in my opinion....
It’s hideous.
Front end gives me late-model Ford Fusion vibes.
Can ve pick color😁
Wake me up when you get to the part that’s worth a million dollars…🥱😴
The front looks like a Ford Fusion and the rear looks like a Dodge. Second, the front side view looks like a Kia Stinger.....its a mut. Drive it off the lot you’re out 200k due to instant depreciation. I’ll keep making my mortgage payments to something that appreciates in value over time not drop $200k right off the lot.
Best I can do is 30 grand and I'm changing the wheels
The mazda 3 2020 look like the cheap knock off version of the Lagonda lol my opinion thou
Doug it's UGLY 😵
The E38 7 series looks better than this. I would buy a V12 7 and save myself the cash. Most people would think this is a Maserati in any case.
This car is crap
Thissssss is the most luxurious Ford Fusion money can buy..
prof lucas torres ta chique
Thanks for the video Mr.Doug. 👍   Well it sure looks good.👍 But if you take out the fridge, and bring it to $75,000; it will sure look good for bodyguards...  Aston Martin did a cool job! 👍😊
Overrated car!
Really doesn't look impressive to me 🙂
It's NOT beautiful at all, Doug. It's obscene.
Fantastic exterior design, low-quality interior design with leather packaging, outdated user interface...
That rear door function, BMW has it for the 7 series, and the 2020 Bentley flying spur is a much more luxurious and better looking car. The flying spur looks like a million bucks,  this doesn't.
I: "This car was launched in 2015, and I got to know about it only now???!?!?"  But for a million-dollar car, the lack of attention to detail in some places is a little surprising, like that refrigerator fan, which could be blocked if luggage is placed carelessly in the boot, and as one other commenter mentioned, it does not even have an electrically-operated boot door.
the title should be "the most overpriced Expensive Luxury Sedan"
10:03 nope
This is why I follow u Doug, u give constant scoring weather it is a million $ car or a Ford Pinto.
ugliest thing ever
Get a room Doug
Ford Fusion
Rolls Royce puts the umbrella inside the door very cool and works in a rainy day... aston martin put in the middle of the trunk... thats resume.
Money laundering at its finest.
exterior is nice but interior is absolute garbage 🗑 😐
fail @ 10:02
Looks like my chevrolet when a take of the side spoilers to paint.
I was constantly waiting for that million-dollar feature. Turns out it's just disturbingly overpriced.
Rapiiid
Clinically underpriced!!!
It is clear that this carriage  ain’t worth a million dollars 😅
Front looks like a Dodge Dart
I don‘t like the rear at all looks like you liked on a stone for too long. The front is very sexy tho
Doug wants them clicks but most of the comments I've seen aren't flattering. 1 mil for a car where the seat belt height can't be adjusted? And that joke of a entertainment system?  Naming it Taraf to placate to the oil rich assholes in the middle east I guess.  Rich people are pretty fucking stupid.
How much dollars did u get to say luxurious a million times
Rolls royce sweptail: am I a joke to you  Costs 12 mil
this ain’t it chief
Lmao who thought this was a good idea, especially with that price tag
Looks like a Honda Accord
As ironic as it sounds the front end looks really similar to a ford taurus 😂
Possibly the ugliest steering wheel I’ve ever seen
YT Suggestion Algorithm: Hello you poor man! Wanna see how Aston Martin looks like from inside?
The website says it's got 88 miles on the clock and they let you drive it?
Please make a video of old saab 900/900 Turbo
I guess Middle Eastern’s are bunch of suckers to buy this kind of junk.
For such an in-depth, quality review, I never understand why Doug flashes straight from the static to the drive review. Why would you not show the start procedure or have some exhaust note clips to link the two? Makes no sense.
And this is definitely one of the prettiest sedans ever made
That flat black color is sooooo ugly.
Extremely underwhelming interior for the price. Piano black plastic? Plain leather headliner? Ford Focus turn signal stalk? Pixelated digital displays? What a letdown.
In what world would i want this instead of a Mercedes S-Class that literally is shitting on everyone else in terms of cutting edge tech including RR in some areas. And the S class is one tenth of the price of this thing, not to mention the Cadillac CT6 is even cheaper and probably has a better sound system as well.
This car SUCKS thought it was a Ford, waste of money
Looks like a Genenis or a Honda Accord
This would look way better as a wagon. There, I said it.
Dang no cooled back seats!!! Dang
Looks like a Ford Fusion mixed with a dodge challenger
Doug is excited about capless gas technology. 😄😄😄
Taraf in Arabic means Wastage
This dude has the greatest job in the world. Smh I should have made better decisions
Canada is in North America and is in KM/H. Additionally the EPA has no standing in Canada or Mexico.
Total waste of money at this type of worst car
Looks like a fastback e93 with a bit more rake
Beautiful and luxurious Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf created for the Arab peninsula Princes. I would have preferred to buy a Rolls Royce Phantom or a Mercedes S Class for 1/3 of the price. the Lagonda Laraf is a highly collectible limited edition car that is why it cost $1 million
If I had trees that grew money I still wouldn't buy this thing
$1M for a freaking GARMIN???? what a sh*t of a car
a Mercedes-Maybach S650 is at least as luxurious and surpasses the Taraf in every other category and costs 200 grand.  A million dollars for an english car with two iPad-holders and a Garmin navigation system, exactly my sense of humor 😆
those rims look cheap
All I can see is the front end of a new model Honda Accord (someone mentioned earlier) and the back end that's a baby of the back of the Dodge Charger and the front of the Dodge Challenger...  Is it an attractive looking sedan?...yes.  The best looking sedan ever?....not even close.  The Mercedes AMG GT 4-Door Coupe is far better looking and less than a quarter of the price, and better performance, too.
I love that think it looks so futuristic and different. Also can we talk about how Doug was standing next to a centanario in a Walmart tee and some 5 dollar shorts 😂
Nothing about this car justifies the price. Shitty technology, no screens, crappy iPad holders, ugly Honda exterior. The phantom does literally EVERYTHING better for half the price
it looks like a  late era Plymouth Sebring from the outside.
Doesn't look the part to me. Like an unfinished regular AM design.
"THIISSSS is the most expensive Mondeo!"
I like how the door started to fall closed and he grabbed it and continued to say it stays exactly where you put it.
Most overrated car I've ever seen..million dollar tarraf doesn't feel like million dollar car
Looks cheap
I love lagonda brand Nd taraf but it’s too overpriced it doesn’t have competitors in terms of pricing Aston is crazy
This car is absolutely a disgust for me, I mean compare the centre console in the front seats and the infotainment screen to the Tesla model S, even a BMW 3 series has a better centre console, considering those cars are 10x cheaper than the Lagonda. Absolutely a disgrace for the money.
"You also have here the button to pop your trunk" One of the quirks and features from a 1 million dollars car.
I'm personally insulted you think this thing is better looking than the E38
I watched the whole video thinking of how does it comes out better than a phantom🤔
How about the alpina b7? I feel its definitely more luxury for far less. Maybe not as rare, but definitely excellent on the styling. Wish one of those could meet your reviews. Definitely the first choice for me if I was to purchase luxury.
Bet the manifolds were gonna be too much to change the molds (even for a million dollar car) for so they just kept it Aston Martin. I think the One-77 is the most beautiful/best car ever to come out of Aston
Looks like a boat from the back, although i kind of like the front it's definitely a machine you could spend a while gawping at.
Honestly the interior doesn’t do it for me, it’s all one color. And maybe it’d just the video, maybe it’s because Doug is so tall, maybe it’s the interior color and leather texture, but it honestly looks kind of cramped? It’s just too much for me
Zzzzzzzzzzz
Maduro motors
Douglas ! Your doing my head in
1 million car and it doesn't even have moon roof....=))
I mean.. I like it but I'd like it more if it got a 75% discount
What overpriced trash. I Wish this care would be LaGONEda AMIRITE
it looks like something you'd buy on LegendaryMotorsports from your iFruit
The front looks like a mazda with Chrysler badge.
I like the new Genesis! Looks good!
Almost looks like a concept car for the new Dodge Charger
Pay a MILLION dollars car: - that navigation screen is awful · but it says LAGONDA everywhere! - yeah, but the tachometer turns in the wrong direction · but it says LAGONDA everywhere!! - ..And the trunk is small and you can see the fridge ventil.. - E V E R Y W H E R E!!!
looks like volskwagen arteon at the front
The interior is so disappointing
Doug needs his eyes tested...very soon..!
This guy is the worst and most annoyingly verbose master of the obvious.  I feel dumber for having stumbled upon this jadorf.
Man those bezels on them iPads will depreciate that car
Looks like a four door Dodge Charger from the side.
Front looks like Honda Accord
IMAGINE PAYING A MILLION DOLLARS FOR A LUXURY CAR AND A MERCEDES W222 MAYBACH  IS BETTER IN EVERYWAY
This is a 10 and the Taycan is a 7.... Doug... come on.
terrible designing. no point of buying
really over priced... I would buy a Porsche Spyder for 1 mill or a mclaren p1
TARAPFFFFF.... Thats a lot of spitting in car Doug, poor owner has to clean it all, lol
I'm worried about the reputation Doug is going to have reviewing other cars when he looks at this one like its a diamond.
It’s a ripoff
That is an absolutely stunning car from the outside, from every angle. Inside, very disappointing - dated, plastic, old tech, low res.
Why does it look like a Ford Fusion lmao
Maybe in british green or other color, it would pop the lines
If I remember the car was reviewed before on this channel. By the way the car looks amazing, the only thing weird in this car is the small, oldschool navigation system.
It's weird talking about "overpriced" with extreme luxury cars but *this* has nothing that justifies that pricepoint. Still seems like a very expensive car, not even close to a million dollar car though.
1 mil and can't even get a factory tint, lulz
Cringe
This car i a joke, a gimmick just ridiculous.
Dude is kneeling on the concrete next to the car. 🤦‍♂️  I love his videos but I’d probably be annoyed with him in real life honestly. Dude seems way to weird.
You can see at 17:48 that this car was probably from Dubai... the radio station was already preset...
For that price, I'll buy BMW, Mercedes, and Audi and get some money back
You should get somebody to get shots of you driving the car.....
Those dots are called broguing
Does not worth more than 300K
Needs a mirror for coke
CAN IT TALK
You'd be dead if you take a shot for every time Doug said 'distinctive'.
I wouldn't pay 20,000 for this.....yuck
The front end looks like a Genesis G80
british rip off!!!!  crapiest satnav even by 90s stsndards!!!!!!  britis always sell same crap for 2 times the expense
The front end looks like a ford Fusion
A million dollars and still no sunroof. "chuckles"
The control center looks pretty similar to my $25k car
Luxury? Naaah.....I'll take 1 Rolls, 1 S Class and 1 DB9 instead of that lahonda...Honda?...What do you mean?...I think it's an Accord on Steroid
So basically you pay one million dollars for the speakers that pop-up when you start the car
My OCD would drive me nuts if I paid $1million for a luxury car and the rear climate display couldn’t even show me the actual temperature setting...
2020 accord
This is.... a Honda Accord
It’s ugly
Ya know what else is rare Doug? A G500 Cab.
Just imagined Doug getting rear ended while testing this 1 Million luxury car....
Eating too much shit
Most beautiful huh, you see that Mazda Vision concept? My 2018 Axela is just as pretty as this thing, and cheaper.
I loved the OG lagondas they were so weird that they were kinda cool
Ok its a really nice car, interior is obviously hand made but anyone else getting Dodge Charger looks? I know there are a good deal of cars that look different on video/photos then in real life but wow that side profile is like THISSS is a 2017 Dodge Charger. Also no go on the 1 Mil Sorry....No. Now I don't have the Mil but I do have some spread so I got a few nice rides but I can just picture a guy with the Mil being presented with this at this posh dealership just saying yeah ..... 1 Mil?  No.
Hey, did Doug create a new car bidding website?  I sure wish I could remember the name. He should plug it more!
Garbage interior... could be priced around 200k... million dollar for this car naaah mann!!!
13:42 trying to watch the quirks and features of a million dollar car but all i can focus on is doug's dirty knee from kneeling on a parking garage floor
Doug: WOW LOOK AT THE TURN SIGNALS ON THE REAR LIGHT! SO COOL! THEY TURN FROM RED TO ORANGE!
Million dollar value? Find me one person who will buy this car for more than 80k. Thats the real value of the car
and here we go again, those side vents are called gills as in fish gills, or just vents if you arent imaginative... but side grill, a new brilliant pearl of vistom from "i saw it first" boy Dougie :D
Ha ha haaaaa, I can't pay for this car because it's Ugly. Roseroys and Bentley are far more the best than this Martin's whatever
Poor design
I'd actually say that the current gen Volvo S90 looks about as good.
I can’t believe that car is a million
i think he only thinks it’s so beautiful because it’s expensive as hell.... it doesn’t look that good lol
The interior looks like a cow barfed its insides out.
Very rare to see a 10/10 from Doug.
We are living during a pandemic, high unemployment, and the lowest GDP on record yet we still marvel how the very rich live. I think things are a bit unbalanced right now. Thanks 2020.
I rather be in bmw 7 series
So you are telling me that there are around 120 people who think this looks beautiful and paid 1m to buy this? what a strange world we live in! 😱
Before I read the title and just looked at the pic, I thought it was a Challenger with those generic looking wheels.  Not sure if this is beauty or quite pedestrian, I"m leaning towards the latter.
I prefer Carwow
big gril in east market is a symbol of luxury i think. First audi then bmw and then the aston :p
A million dollars for a car that looks like a Ford Fusion and is covered in chalk board paint.
this car sucks
Terrible compared to the E38 styling.....
So we just not gonna talk about the centenar...no? well aight then
In Romania, Taraf stands for traditional music orchestra.
And he just sits there in shorts 😀
I didnt even know this model exsisted, ive heard of Lagonda before though and knew it was part of Aston Martin, it makes you think what other bespoke car brands have hidden models for the middle east and asia markets! This car looks really nice from the front, rear and interior but the side profile doesnt look the nicest, you cant tell its an Aston Martin Lagonda worth a Million dollars from the side it just looks like a unknown brand from asia of a seddan for the american market costing about $30,000! I dont like the wheels either, when you can see the brake discs and caliphers that much it looks more race car, Rolls and Bently the 2 best luxury car brands never have this type of design, they are always a full wheel design hiding the inner workings, yes wheels can be changed so its not a fault with car, id like to see a wheel with 20+ spokes on this and no flashy coloured caliphers! Something else you dont really see on high end bespoke luxury brands! This car is still very nice though.
You get happy when you see the car but when watch the video, why will you spend 1 million bucks for a car which is not extra ordinary. My RS7 is the best and it cheaper too. 6.0 12 which can produce up 600 hp. My RS7 is 680hp and it's 4.0
I do like the styling. It looks like a Mazda 6, only a little less modern. Very good looking car.
Ohhh Doug. 8:45. Use a pillow next time, have mercy on your knees, we need you in top shape for new content, to handle the channels and the auction site. :)
Front: accord Side: impala Back: charger
For a million dollar car, they can't find another way to hide that key hole?  Designed by Accounting department of Aston Martin who played too much GTA V.
so many things to break, made by a company that has gone bust 7 times
Yet again Aston Martin pays tribute to England's rich kit car culture. Indeed, the 80s Lagonda is another such tribute.
I expected the engine cover also have leather.
Why it's worth million dollars ?  Look at turn signals
somthing very wrong her, this car not so beautifully , i think he got paid by aston Marton
What does the showcar title means? Can you just drive it?
Looks like a counterfeit Rolls Royce without coach doors and handles.
That steering wheel and those center consoles. EWW! Ruins it for me.
Baffled that Aston didn’t make these a full on production model charge $40k more than a rapide. I think they would have done really nicely. Definitely don’t see the value though at $1mil
The Ford Fusion stole the DB9's grille... I just noticed that the new Ford Explorer stole this car's grille.
is this dude ever going to buy a new pair of shoes ?
Imagine paying a million for THISSSSS.  I would rather have a fully custom Phantom, and a Ferrari.
S90 looks better
Next time do an unbiased review. Rear door stopping points are there in my fiat punto, and car is only for $18000. Lol
Maserati vibes
Doug is 100% pandering to Aston Martin and the dealership that let him show this thing.  But, I guess I shouldn't complain too much, I got to have a look at one!  Automobiles like this are a tough one for me.  Astons are pretty cars, for sure, but worth $1m USD?...I dunno  Like he said, it has a freaking turn signal stalk from a FORD lol.  The oil sheiks these cars were marketed to don't care though, I'm sure Aston sold every one of these cars.
Best i can do is 70k. More than that and im buying a Lexus.
Who in their right mind when they can use that same money and buy a Roll Royce Phantom plus a Rolls Royce Cullinan Blackbadge.
I mean it looks nice, but it doesn't look _that_ much nicer than a Rolls Royce. The only type of person I could see ever buying this is a trust fund kid who has never worked in their life, yet has access to hundreds of millions of dollars to basically burn. The type of person who has nearly unlimited money and has no concept of the value of money.  So the kids of oil tycoons in Dubai. Aston Martin knew exactly what they were doing.
100 000 dollars on a good day.
i'd buy a s class over this
Liked the way he pronounces lagonda "TARAF"
This is one concept car that should've NEVER made it to production🤯 No panoramic roof and has a Best Buy Garmin navigation system💀💀💀
Taraf said 245 times.
For $1M i expect something special like a 9-liter V16 (like intended for the RR Phantom - look for Johny English V16 Phantom) and full custom interior. Not a rebranded Aston at 4 times the price. I have seen Dougs review of the new Bentley Flying Spur and i would take that over this any time. Bentley interior is just another level than this Aston...and i can buy a Lambo and a house together with the Bentley and still spare some money :)
Its fugly
The car definitely looks like a concept.. about time they woke up to something different not rich average lol
This car is terribly ugly looks like the production year for this car is 2002 looks cheaply built digusted
When you buy a Maserati on GTA
Ugly!
10:02 precisely closes - from every point No soft close. The Mercedes S500 W140 has had soft close from the 90ties! Taraf for idiots! 10:13 Hydaulic like in Grandpa's wheel chair. Nothing voice controlled, no gesture control (RR did not answer my letter me asking for when both oder at least one of both will come).
Jhaante na chuchi...baate uchi uchi. Lauda Ka Aston hai
it really is amazing to se this 1 million dollar car and then you see Doug in his Craigslist outfit out colors dont match AT ALL and his second grade elementary school haircut hahahahaha
A million dollar!!!! A Lexus is million times better than this crap.
9:58 my car does the same, but for the wrong reasons 😅
Here's my lexus ls https://youtu.be/sJjNamkP2fQ
I must say I thought it looked like a Cadillac CTS. Or like a generic computer game car that couldn't get a brand license.
This car is obviously overpriced, doesn't look special or particularly appealing. Nothing in this car justifies its price and everyone has the same opinion here. The fact that on a 1 million dollar car the most interesting features are the doors that "stay in place" and the little straps onto which the rich decrepit tasteless owners of this bag of mediocre luxury will hoist themselves out of it, speaks for itself. It's a Rapide that costs 5 times more.. I would go as far as saying that this car is a scam.
Nobody: Nobody in History: Doug: Luhgahnduh 😂😂
Front end looks like a new accord.
Shot for every "distinctive" and I'm already smashed 7 min in this video
This thing shouldn’t cost more than an S-class
Stop saying ANNND
la 1mil de dolari pui telescop la usa uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Was this a product placement or something else paid?  You're praising an ugly car and features that look pretty half-assed throughout the video. It's not a desired car, this video didn't change that.
Correct me if I´m wrong, Does it say Lagonda instead of Aston Martin?  Video didn´t make it clear.
The ford explorer has stolen these headlights
This is not comparable to Phantom. Does not feel like a million dollar car.
who’s stupid gonna buy this shit car
uhh looks old
I would buy Mercedes Maybach and a commercial property and put that property on rental to get more money out of it , rather then buying this if I have this much money to spend on a car.
About that kid friendlyness... If I had a million dollar luxury sedan there would be no way I'd let my kids in the back.
Aston Martin had a baby with bmw i8 and a challenger
"This is one of the most beautiful cars ever made. 10/10 sytling"  If I drove past this car I wouldn't notice it. I guess I just really don't know anything about cars.
Doug is rhe type of guy to brush his teeth and immediately drink orange juice and say yummmm
That cigarette lighter looking key fob 😂🤣
One million dollars for a car that looks like a upgraded Honda Accord.... good job rich people
This car is ass
Ugly car. The name won’t save it.
It's nice but NOT $1M.
Stop lying Doug...that's that new joint effort from Hyundai and Chrysler
My 2017 F250 has cooled rear seats wtf
This is a joke right? My Hyundai is better equipped.
Am I the only one to think that this car has too much leather inside?
How much did Aston Martin pay you to do this review?
How he is giving this car a good review is beyond me
The interior looks dated
200k top. Million is a joke
Imagine spending 1 million dollar and getting garbage like this with odometer shittier than civic and central infotainment system like some 15 years old middle luxury carsv
This is a $300k sedan with a $700k badge. Awesome but not nearly deserving of the price tag.
So they’re basically like Hyundai with the Genesis brand
How can this be an ultra luxury sedan?? Every S-class would destroy this thing...
It looks cheap anyways.
It looks like a Genesis
This is the Grey Poupon car for the 21st century.
You are right... because you have to sell it...
Mercedes: Introducing Maybach, our luxury brand.  Aston Martin: Hold my beer.
That’s most definitely not the best looking sedan ever and not even in the top 10. I wouldn’t pay a quarter of a mill that for this dribble. 1 million? Ask my bollocks.
Yikes. 1 million for this? and the cool factor is definitely a solid 3.
Most expensive sedan? What about the Koenigseg Gemerra 4 seat @1.7$??
That engine looks like a bitch to work on. Gotta take the intake manifold off to do spark plugs? Lmao and plastic valve covers on a million dollar car hahahaha 😂
The interior looks like the interior of my mum's old 1970s Reliant Scimitar.
That is the most mundane exterior I’ve seen on any car never mind a seven figure vehicle. Smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
I don't agree that it's beautiful. Maybe in person it looks better.
This is truly one of the UGLIEST cars I've ever seen. Baffles me that you think it's good looking, even though looks are subjective.
Is it just me, or is there really nothing special about this car? Certainly nothing worth a one million dollar price tag.
Gorgeous car for stupid people
New Insignia looks better than that, wtf xD
check out the dud in the blue pickup at 24:58. army helmet and does move at ALL. I'm wondering of that;'s supposed to be an HOV dummy thing.
6:26 The front grill looks like a creepy smile of a perv to me
Better go for Fantom that looks and feel expensive
Crap..!! It doesn’t look pricy at all..!! Cheaply and plasticky
It's not a single clutch automated manual but rather ZF tourque converter automatic, which explains the smoothness. I really love the coach build nature of that car.
Nice Ford Fusion 🤣
This car is kind of a rip off. The only thing cool about those car is the name brand
I mean, it a good looking car, but $1 million good looking? Not even close
like the 70's Lagonda which was also stupidly expensive this car will drop in value the moment they stop this era's production. Never buy an Aston Martin that allows you to lose a million dollars because it will take every dime of it  every time.  You might want to keep this in mind when the new Valkyrie or Vanquish becomes available and steer clear from this money pit.
Basically an over priced Aston Martin Rapide. Frankly the Rapide looks much better than this. The front end reminds me of a Ford Taurus.
OMG that console is so from the 2000s. Absolutely disgusting.
Calling this expensive? Clearly you never heard about used bmw's
Conclusion of the whole review the car ist ultra cool because it there is the leganda logo everywhere
Sleeping Joe get out from my channel go to nursing home!!!
Anyone else think this car looks kinda like a overpriced Dodge Charger ?
Big time ripoff car lol
I wouldn't pay 90k for this
Looks like a car from GTA V
Did I see this right? is there no mention of the car been fully made of carbon fiber?
Talk to much shit
How is that legal in the US without the ugly front/rear side running lights?
The review starts at 3:26
Honestly the VW Arteon looks better.
Talking shit more than it's specifications
The front looks like a ford mondeo
Who even buy this shit
what is he smokin!!! styling 10!!
Bentley is owned by Volkswagen, but you don't get Audi/Volkswagen indicator switches in Bentleys. They're luxuriously finished in metal.
Damn this thing is ugly.
Me watching this video: "This is a 2018 Aston Martin Lagon... *pauses video* LAGONDEEZNUTS"
Funny! Quagmire reviewing cars!
Hey Doug, it looked like the ashtray was solid sterling silver. Do you know if that's  right?
I’m arabic and never heard TARAF word in my whole life
This seems like a 150 to 200k car to me
What an ugly POS. I couldn't have more drastically different tastes to Doug even if I tried. This looks like a Kia Stinger with a cringey matte wrap or something. That is actually an insult to the Stinger which looks better still. More like Ford Fusion or Hyundai Elantra, as others have said.
Bro the more I watch this the more this car looks cheep. Like a Lexus RCF is more luxury than this
I feel like Aston Martin payed him to find good things to say about this car😂
This looks like a Ford Fusion.
This man will kiss your ass for cash. Jesus 😂 "Exquisite taste" 😑
The most beautiful 4 door sedan of all time, ha,ha,ha.😂😂😂. I don't think so.
They glass panel where there is usually hard plastic is not anything but a fancy slightly more expensive touch that they could add to any vehicle for a small increase in price but don't. The door handles on this thing are more complicated to open than the sensor handles on my tuarus. It's unique and that's it 😂
According to Doug, the more money you spend on a car, the more BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL a car becomes 🤦‍♂️😂 what the fuck.
The front lowkey reminded me of a Ford Taurus
The world's most expensive but stupid sedan
Always great to see a Doug review. He does his job well and for that I'll give him a 10. Lot's of good reviews Doug, get rich.
For safety sake that car needs to be crash tested...
The Center Pattern on the seats are known a Brogue pattern, often found on Gentleman's Dress Shoes (usually as a raised pattern). The Taraf is Exquisite!!!!!!!!!!!
I've thought about this sedan a bit. I definitely don't agree with the price, but hey, if the English want to charge Arabs more for cars, I'm cool with that. I do believe it is a beautiful car, maybe not THE most, but definitely up there. Would be worth it with more tweaks. The Lagonda brand always had a very long, lean wheelbase, and this reflects that history. I find it hilarious all the comparisons to Accords, etc. But yeah, there def could be more for the money other than being just a limited edition. Doesn't look like ceramic brakes. Doesn't look like magnesium rims. Doug neglected to talk about both of those. A retractable panoramic sunroof that rolls the leather back may be novel. As others have mentioned, bespoke CNC machined knobs should be a requirement. A higher powered engine, supertuned, but not for sportscar like ride. And fitted luggage. Higher quality nav... and basically everything everybody else has said...
The exterior looks like a ~$300-400k car.... then the interior. Woof.  Maybe $100k.  Chevy interiors are just as nice lmao
fugly. looks like a gta car. "omg the red led turns orange, how luxurious!" my 2010 citroen has better navigation than this...
yeah.... no thanks...even if this was 100K cheaper than the Rolls Royce Phantom I still wouldnt buy it over the Rolls
shitty car for the money id buy a phantom and keep the change for gas
Take a shot every time he says “distinctive”
Sooooo what it is? A Lincoln Accord or a Honda Continental? Or yes?
You have a BIG REALLY BIG ISSUE WITH ACCELERATION! Lux cars not mean to be the fastest, that is not luxury. A Rolls proves that. But when you talk about the interior you missed the problems with the anesthetics on the interior. For example a combination with Black, beige and grey... or the fact of a Bentley Mulsanne has 2000 pcs just in the interior of the car and hand made. That is lux! Sorry, I would not buy this car and I am an Aston fan!!!! The Maserati Quatroporte its  a much better car than this... by far!!!!
I think from reading the comments that most don’t care for it. Driving it will change your mind. And rolls & Bent this is an entirely different machine. The only thing in common is the country they’re all built in
The standard benchmark for over engineering. This car isn’t about lux it’s about tech. And quest for perfection, to stimulate all of your senses at once. I would never consider this a luxury car but rather a lesson on teaching people what they rant & need
Isn't Lagonda a separate brand owned by Aston Martin? That's probably why it only says Lagonda everywhere.
I'm 99% sure the rear seat drink cooler is built by Mercedes 🤷🏻‍♂️
lol La gonda in my language means The Huge Ass Bhahahahhahaha
So ugly, not even worth $100,000
I wanna see a review that the dealer wont see
What trim is that Fusion? 😂
NOT NOT NOT beautiful AT ALL!!!!!!
Only 2 Lagonda Taraf in the American continent the other one is in Mexico and is the opposite color.
Interior and exterior design worst car i have seen for the price tag of 1million dollar seriously how much does that creepy cost them to manufacture this car i guess 50k
phantom has way more features than this over priced POS
Anybody see the bmw i8 in the headlights? And a little bit of Ford mondeo?
Personally I'd applaud Aston Martin. They thought rich Arabs would buy *this* car for *that* much, and they were right. 😬😆
Si si ahí en español culos💪😎
This man needs to learn how to converse with a public and not to a class of 5 year olds.
This is the ugliest sedan to ever come out today. I think it beats Saturn lol. For most kids who don't know what Saturn is, it was a GM car too not just the Planet. It's so weird because I got people who told me Saturn is a planet... No shit I know... But it also was a car brand made by GM.
Don’t hate me, but        It’s a luxury sedan with an Audi grill, I8 headlights, and is weirdly long in the front compared to the rest of the body. Anyone agree? No? Just me.
No sun roof ?? (I man "moon roof" in American !)  In a car this expensive, it would sure be nice the have a glass or steel sunroof as standard ...
I’d rather drive a Ford Fusion
That liscense plate holder on the front is disgusting 🤢🤮
Why where you saying db9 when it was not being made for way over 6 years when it came out? It’s based off the rapide anyway.
The Rapide is better looking
Dumb.
This seems too basic and boring for a 1 mil luxury car tbh, rolly is still at the top
i would literally rather burn 1 million dollars in a fire
Fat boy door handle.
Like someone in the comments said it looks like a stretched Ford fusion
So, 80.000 Maserati is overpriced, but a million dollar sedan that looks stupid and ugly is ok.  Ahhh Doug
Is that Harley Davidson guy  Who mentioned harley davidson an unnecessary number of times in a certain car review???
I wonder how much fees and taxes the government (and the State of California!) charged to import and title this...
Luxury car brands be charging for a sheet of leather and a few minutes of stitching it together like it’s 24K gold... Think about the surcharge for leather in a Honda Accord, it’s a few hundreds per seat, not tens/hundreds of thousands.
Seems to me a lot of owners will forget their key inside the slot. I’ll keep this in mind when I see this car parked on the street 😗
This looks like something made in 2008
holly shit its a v12 !!!
ItS bEtTeR tHaN a RoLlS-rOyCe
Also the uglyest 😅
I have seen this matte (unpolished) black color among other brands like Porsche. I wonder how easy it is to wash-out stains and how it would respond to polishing.
Even if I could afford  I would pass
Doug you don't mention that its hand coach built. Hand rolled and beaten panels (not easy with aluminium). Many hundreds of hours of love and skill went into these cars
Looks like a 2020 accord from the outside tbh
You sould dress for reviewing a $1million car not in sort pant
Looks like a big Renault 25.
Doug mispronounced it. It is pronounced more like ta-ruff.
Yuck! I don't want aluminum hardware in my $1,000,000 Lagonda. I would expect nothing less than palladium or pure gold. C'mon Aston Martin why are you cheating out.
20:42 Yeah lets smoke in the million dollar whip and leave it smelling like a smokers lounge and lung cancer
11:41 Hand stitched and beautiful, yeah but tbh a little artwork on all this boring leather f.e some kind of wing/ feather design (referring to Aston Martin logo) would live up to the price. BE MORE CREATIVE
Or you can buy a Hyundai Genesis for 10k
Although I respect your opinion Doug but I think the Taraf looks a bit strange and generic. For a car like that you would expect a more original and special design with less cost cutting.
Oh, It has standard european direction lights, that's luxury😂
Only fool people will buy this shit by spending 1million $ what kind of luxury you are talking about it's completely a shit for 1million $ price
Did they get those headlights from the 2020 Honda Accord?
4:52 I bet that glass in the middle worth more than my kidney.
This many times doug said distinctive 👇🏼
Not worth 1million
This is the longest pile of rubbish I have ever seen.
Honestly 1milion $ for nice stitching. Its 250k worth 4 door saloon. 750k for being rare. BMW   also can wrap every panel in leather and will cost you 1/4 of the price.
What's so special in this car that worth 1kk ?
Am i seeing (or not) things? A million bucks for this car and it doesn’t hava a sunroof?!
The interior reminds me of a Lincoln lol
what happens to the windows wen its raining
why do i feel like a million is too much for this car?
he said the car name and its price a million times. my god
that thing is hideous, dougy must've taken up crack smoking during quarantine.
No score is 10 and he said best....? Didn't worth the money... Rolls royce ♥
the front looks like the new hyundai elantra lol
Lol those doors did not stay open I saw them move
Bet you if this was a Honda or Toyota, Doug would have given the styling a 6 at best.
Not worth for money ,
The car looks like trash. The original lagonda was trash too
1 million dollar car with softex seats the same thing in a Toyota that Aston Martin is a joke
Cuesta  1 millón de euros no dólares, por lo que ví en diversos sitios aficionados al motor
No sun roof on a million $ car? No sun roof? Okay, That's why I will never buy this 🙏
This is ugly as hell. Also is an AM so the depreciation it’s going to be monumental.
it's a beautiful car but not a million dollar beautiful, saw a Wraith on my way home right now and that car still has more presence than this.
Looks like a new accord mixed with a new Taurus😂
looks beautiful
We get it isn't not an Aston Martin. Hence no Aston Martin branding. Doug seems so surprised by it all.
This car is became "USED car" after the video. =]
I actually really enjoy the looks of it. It's a luxury sedan without the cliche "one percenter" looks, like the luxury Bentleys have.  Still overpriced though.
the car looks so ugly but he said its pretty just to help selling it and when its done they will give him a cut , what a moron this guy is
this is absolute shit for a mil. insane.  give me a 2nd gen phantom, aventador roadster, G63 and a condo in miami
I've loved the look of that car since I first saw one several years ago in UK. That one had a very different quilted interior. The interior on this reminds me of Hermes luggage.
Aston Martin- "People are mocking us, we didnt made Rapide overpriced enough.. we must make Taraf and it must be overpriced enough for those mocker mouths to shut up". 😂
Wtf how is that shitty car that expensive?
looks like a ford taurus SHO from the front lol
My Opel Grandland X has a far better infotainment system than this. And it was a 50th of the price of this.
10/10 on Styling?!? This is one of the ugliest cars I have ever seen.
007🇬🇧
Remove the Lagonda logo and put the price tag to around 40k ....the exterior really isn't that good looking
The front is just a combination of Fusion and Taurus with the grille of any 2020 Audi slapped on
looks like a mix of kia, hyundai and back of a dodge challenger
Gotta look up the crash test ratings.
That dash is absolutey horrendous for a car of this price.
Taraf definitely doesn’t mean “ultimate luxury,” gotta yell at the research department for that one: Doug. Taraf has to do with “excess lavishness,” key focus on excess. Calling it ultimate luxury is like calling a T-bone collision, kinda annoying: it is, but it’s more. Great vid as always Doug.
After reading the comments, i'm surprised people are trying to justify or disprove the million dollar tag price. There's no substitute for scarcity. Having lived a few years in Dubai, the one thing they squander money on are licence plates, a few of those costing more than a million dollars : for a license PLATE. A piece of square, cheap tin with a couple of numbers written. Uniqueness is worth a lot in UAE/KSA/KWT/BHR/QAT. Once you've seen a dozen Veyron, a thousand RR, a million Benz/Maybach, you realise : A Taraf separates true posh from wannabes.
Absolutely amazing, and one of the best reviews you've done. I guess I was expecting a proper shirt for the drive this time, not just a rag...
E38 is ugly.
Am i the only one who saw the video and thought "Doug, get a room"? xD
cool honda accord
It costs 1 million dollars and it has the same infotainment screen as an audi a1, smh. The only thing luxurious about this car is the price tag.
"to hide the crappiness" 13:25 lol I'm sure those were the words used by the Lagonda design team
10:25 - I just hope this car has soft close doors since Doug slams it. LOL
Coolest part of the Car is the key system.
6:40 - And yet they managed to make it look like a Dodge Charger...
A rare.. possibly singular horrendous review from Doug... A 4 for value? The resale on this is 600k today even though its a super limited production which is -- BARF.     "This... is a dumpster fire filled with 1 million dollars."
I dunno if I'd go so far as de-throning the E38, but it is very good looking. My opinion might shift if I saw one in real life, but having not, the E38 is still top dog for me.
This car's a joke right?
Why do I see a BMW I8 when he showed the car with both door open hahahahaha
The infotainment is not even worth $100 000
This car should be placed as picture for what design afterthought looks like... You messed up anything during design phase? Do not fret, just throw in cheap pathetic key hole on the door, whatever interior pieces you have in your shop and even the rear triangle windows that look like they were taken out some mid '70s soviet vehicle. And presto - 1 million comes in while your car is just a quickly run money grab...
A Fisker Karma is way more beautiful.
Dough you are fool
Why wouldn't I buy this for 1 mil, enjoy a bit, drive a bit, and then sell it for 2 mil in 10 years? Prove me wrong.
umm ok it’s not noticeable but that fridge button is out of a benz
Wait when you be able to review One-77
i will better buy RR
Honestly doesn't look like a million dollar car,more like 150-200k
I don't understand the trend of $100,000+ cars with flat black paint jobs.
👎
And now Aston Martin has 2012 mercedes infotainment system. such a big improvement :D . I guess British government gave citizenship for those middleeasterns who bought this car. There is no other explanation. Doug even after this video, they wont be able to sell this car in California :D
Dodge's rich cousin
The boot has soft close so you don't have to slam the boot.   Doug: Slams the boot. 😅
Looks like it's all ready for paint.
This car is small...Doug is tall, I cansee his legs up in the back seat. He doesnt fit combortably there.
The GPS is not touch screen............. the temperature scale doesnt show how many degrees is in the back seat. is it a Peugeot?
even if I had 100000000000000000 $ I would never buy this car. The Maybach is much more comfortable. Sorry
I’d buy one, but it only has four seats and I am in a family of five.
Very ugly looking car
Could that display be any smaller or thicker Ahaha
Probably the most overpriced car...ever. Its doesnt look terrible, but certainly not $1,000,000. Might aswell just get a mercedes S class
Me: The car looks ugly... Him: "THIS CAR IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL" Me: ...
Honestly it's quite a horrible car. If you want an Aston Martin, buy a sports model. If you want a luxury sedan, buy a Rolls or a Bentley. Crap dashboard (Unacceptable for a car of this price) and so much leather it's like sitting in a cow. Needs more variety of materials. Not even any carbon fibre, swap out the plastic panels in the engine bay. I love Bentley's new 3D wood option for example. The horizontal filler cap is asking for fuel splashes to ruin the paintwork. This car makes no sense to me. Half arsed design for people with too much money & no taste in cars.
Nah, I still think bmw 7 series is the king.
Ugly car!
Why is it worth 1 million?
A nice car.
25:15 "Its super rare, you will not encounter it in your country"  4:07 "I actually stumbled upon one of these street parked"
The designers basically looked at other Aston Martins and took away all the aesthetic features that made them stand out so they could go for a "minimalist approach".
This looks like a car that tries to look expensive so the owner who spent $50,000 can feel important.
How to waste 1 million$? Here it is laganda
Ugly asf
This car is huge, must be nice to sit in. Ultra rare. It’s worth it if you like being chauffeured.
Thissss is a $100 hot dog
10:03 almost fucked it up lol
Doug reviewed the Rapide. Its now $80 000. So how does the lagonda cost $1 000 000 ?????????
Features are not even close to an Audi S4... 1 Million dollar 😳😳😳😳
I know the short rear is an aerodynamic feature. Remebering the stub actually decreased drag
ugh jesus matte black sucks
If a ford focus and genesis g80 had an interracial baby born in Europe and became an expat in the M.E. lol
That’s a very expensive Ford Fusion
My mans in a million dollar car while wearing those dusty ass shorts. Homie couldnt even comb his hair bro.... much love tho
It's literally a rapide but a newer design
How much is it again?  😏😂
13:06 the dots and circles look like the mouths and eyes of the innocent souls trapped in the leather seats of a one million dollar car
It won’t be most expensive when it drops 500k in 3 years 😂 Aston martins drop value faster than like every brand
you can buy a Senna for under one Mill 🧐
What kind of lambo was at 0:41?
Imagine buying this and someone says "That's a cool looking accord"
why would i buy this instead of a rolls royce?
Apart from the leather wrapped headliner you can pretty much get all of those features in a Kia
My parents own this car, just has a Honda Accord badge inplace of the A.M. Lagonda wings!
I like the Rolls Royce or Bentley more than this one. Probably the interior is responsible for that
The car is far from beautiful.
Doug, if you think this is the most beautiful sedan ever you're gonna love the new Honda Accord.
A few things here: - The upper back of your hair. Did you wake up from a cuddly nap some time before this recording or did you perhaps wear a cap due to an intense sunshine? Inane, I know, yet I could not help but notice. - The door hydraulic obviously does not work when the door is opened only very narrowly, which is what a thinner snake for example, or a sheet of paper, would find useful, so your statement unfortunately is incorrect. - That 200.000 US$ difference between 1.000.000 US$ and two times 600.000 US$, wire me this 'practically no difference', will ya? - These advertising cutscenes, man! It breaks immersion even more that they were recorded in other locations and points in time. - A lagoon and a gondola walk into a bar where there are no cids... :P
Do NOT watch this video at 240p or this car will look terrible...
It looks like my neighbors camaro but stretched out. He has a primer coat on his car too. But he only paid $2,300.
I'd spend a million on a house and on a Honda Accord
Front looks like a sxt charger lol
this car is not special... its overpriced as hell, should be like 40-50ish
What is REARBELT?
Looks like Chinese Aston Martin. Such a meter of stupidness of people who steal so much to buy this crap
Are you 🙏???
That’s an expensive Ford Fusion
Worth millions to kneel down the car doug😅😅
Honestly it’s crappiest looking car. C’mom there are better looking sedans than this!
Did they mean to rip off the gen-2 CTS-V C pillar or was that just an accident?
A 100k car people who pay 1m are really crazy. Buy a S class amg benz and you got way more for your money.
In my opinion it’s seriously FUGLY ! 😏
tttttttttttttttttttthehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeissss issss
Doug...the kinda guy who points his finger across the bottom of the screen when explaining something...just in case your thick,and cant see it
The polestar looks a million times better
Looks just like a Rapide on the inside. Bleh.
This car looks half million dollars and cheap simultaneously. Not worth a million bucks not when they use ford turn stalks and Garmin satnav.
Front looks like a fucking Honda accord lmfao
Talking about beauty, I think it's a bit mondeo-ish.
Ya didn't they do the same height in the front as the back. If they did it in the back they can do it in the front too right ?😐😐
That is one seriously ugly car.
Kachra
"Taraf" means luxury in Arabic.
the Gemera is/ will be the most expensive sedan
Ford Taurus front
It’s shaped the same as the Lamborghini. Estoque
I'm kinda salty tha a bunch of the finishes/trim come from other cars...it's like c'mon, for a million dollars each you can do a run of 120 custom turn stalks and knobs, right?
Someone needs to accumulate all the clips where he says, "they've only made x amount of these for the entire ___." because the different words that he uses to exaggerate the rarity of the vehicles is just hilarious.
he should reveiw james bonds db5
I love aston martin but this car is a bit retarded
From the front it looks like a mondeo
Lagonda was a sedan in 2002 by daewoo motors..
Doug needs a taraf knee pad!
Not worth it. Just purchase a Rolls Royce
This is a amazing car, and crazy too !  I love it !!
Aston Martin has started to be 5 seat vehicle? It's a nonsense.
cyber punk 2077 took some notes.
overrated
I can't believe Doug spoke so highly of this car. He always seems to take price point into consideration and holds more expensive and special run cars to a higher standard. He always mentions when high end cars share parts with cheaper cars and knocks them for it. Is this car going to end up on cars and bids soon? Is the dealership paying you commission if it sells? Doug has gone soft.
Idk why but Doug always ponders at a cars glory the more expensive it is, I think this box looks like a fucking volvo from the 90's.
a bit expensive for a beffed Mondeo
It looks a lot like mazda3 doesn’t it?
THIS! ..... is the most overpriced car ver, and heres why!...
The ugliest rear I have ever seen even hybrid boat cars look better. 1 million dollars for one of the most unreliable brands on the planet. Looks like aston martin knows that there are 120 suckers in this world.
It looks like a cross between a Challenger and a Chrysler 300.  I'll take one anyway.
Looks like a long ford fusion taurus hybrid
Ta ra Taraf, no thanks..
For a million it’s really not that impressive
Aston can name their cars as fancy as they want, In reality, they’ll always remain to be shit-faced af 🤣
Did Aston paid ?
This car would be right at home in one of those "How I made 10000$ a day working from home" clickbait ads
That pop up nav Ford borrowed from the old S60 / S80 from when they owned volvo
I think that this car should give you a Doug score not you give score to her
PEOPLE ...its ..just car .  ..watched 20 sec .300 ZX was a car . this martin aston is like mix of a few cars ive seen .  far from @revelation@
$100k  ok $1M ? Lol lol
if I were an Arab I would be ofended by Aston Martin thinking they can make me buy this piece of shit just because they gave it an arabic name, pff
This REALLY looks like a Peugeot
This is one of those cars where I sort of thought I was going crazy by being so underwhelmed with both how it looks, and its spec. Like am I missing something? But then you find the comment section lol. Insaaaanely overpriced.
Clearly beauty is the eye of the beholder.   Definitely dont see it.  Looks like a Matt black Hyundai or Kia from the side anyway.  Nothing wrong with it.. but most beautiful..  yeah no.
dude whats taraf I'm an arab I never heard of taraf haha
Was it an Aston Martin logo on the navigation screen? 🤔
Surprising none of these came to Qatar, other than being in the middle east, we also have the highest GDP per capita
This looks like a luxurious Honda + Doge Charger... In 5 Years the car will cost less then 500000 dollar...
Was expecting the car to have a jumping mechanism an parachute
thought it was a ford fusion or dodge
Are we just going to ignore this million dollar car has a freaking KEYHOLE!!??
This look like a Honda Accord
какое невнимание к деталям, лезть в не свою новую люксовую тачку с грязными голыми коленками, настоящий американец. (what a lack of attention to detail, getting into a luxury new and not your own car with dirty bare knees, a real American.)
Nonsence...that price for this car..luxury car?They obviously didnt see new S Class
Btec Matt Watson
Taraf in arabic means excessive luxury, I don’t know if there’s a relation tho.
Disliked the car and Doug.  Only good thing I did today.
Mazda 3😗
Can anyone give me a good reason why whatever robber-baron owns one of these should not be killed and eaten?
Lagonda, Lagonda, Lagonda, Lagonda, Rapide, Rapide, Lagonda, Rapide
For this expensive a car, I would not even want to press a button. Everything should be AI and voice controlled. Taraf take me to the moon. Lol!
Why do people moan about this car's price when they couldn't afford one that costs a tenth of it anyway?
Idk doesnt strike me as beautiful at all.
front headlights kinda looks like ford mustang.
The back looks so boring looking and ugly I would take the rolls royce all day
Just like my Chevy truck ... my running lights turn into signal blinking lights
Nope. Not worth it. I would buy a Rolls AND an Aston Martin.... Then maybe a little summer home somewhere...
This is how gta prices their cars
Hon, a cart dinged my door at Walmart, but don't worry, it only cost the price of an S class to fix.
What a joke
Looks like the new Mazda 3 to me
Luxury sedan made specifically for the Middle East, yet no cooled rear seats? Very uncool.
Honestly when he said it's the best looking four door sedan. I personally think the hellcat charger looks better .
There was once an app in Apple Appstore called 'I Am Rich' which sold for $999.99 and did nothing but display -  "I am rich I deserv [sic] it I am good, healthy & successful"   which of course rich people bought, 'Lagonda Taraf' is the car version of it.
I guess the door hydraulic malfunctioned. 👀
Next time I win the lottery I'll buy one anc drive it through a McDonald's drive thru lol
Lol I wonder how Scott Kilmer would rate this. Maybe let him check it out. Lol
So it's a 1 million dollar stretched caddy with and Aston Martin/Audi face. And a v12... I'd buy it if I had money to blow just bc its dumby rare and looks kinda cool. But there is many other things I'd buy with a million dollars
Looks like an out dated chinese knock off of a Kia. Piece of shit forgettable Aston Martin is what this is. You'll never see one on the road.
I cant help but think that the front of this car looks like an 2018 accord?   thoughts?
My 01 LS430 has a fridge in the back. *yawns*
The nav system is such an oversight. 20k smart cars have better systems than that.
If I owned one of these I'd paint it an orange and black square pattern so it could be the giraffe taraf.
If I was building Bentley Mulsainnes I would be asking for 2 mil per car after seeing this
So if you have the money.. definitely buy 2 phantoms.. being that 1 phantom is more luxurious... although this one looks better body wise... but that’s about it
i will kill myself before i buy this
Looks like a cheap Genesis knock off
This video made me lose any credibility I had of Doug. I will not be watching any more reviews because now I know he’s no different than the likes of motortrend or car and driver where they receive payment in return for biased reviews. I thought you were better than this Doug.
Looks like a Renault Talisman extra long for the Chinese market
Doug is losing his hair.. I will be back in about 6 months to give him a Doug score.
The best looking 4 door sedan it’s not. The Jaguar 1984 Vanden Plas or a 1970’s Silver Shadow are the best looking 4 door sedans. It is beautiful but at a million is the reason it wasn’t sold in North America.
With a mill I’d get get RR phantom or Cullinan, a 2020 Tesla roadster, and a porche 911 gt2rs.
BEAUTIFUL CAR. VERY OVERPRICED
This shit is so basic. Would never pay even $100k for this
Front: Ford Fusion/mustang Side: Chevy impala Back: dodge charger
Honestly looks like a shitty chevy/Chrysler product 🤮
The front is a 508 Peugeot
1million sounds less then 900000$ lol thzt why they decided to make it a 1mil
Ugly as hell a 2020 Peugeot 508 looks better lol
Funny thing is that this car doesn't even look nice.
Is it me but the  Maybach and the Rolls seem more impressive and would turn more heads . The profile is almost Italian
Looks like a stretched out Honda Accord
Mr. Demuro! That cat sucks
This feels like a decent attempt by a company to hustle millionaires outta of a milli, that speedo ☠☠so whack
Side Line is horrible
Does it not have soft closing doors?
Wow that's grossly overpriced.  Sedans a quarter of this price has more features
Is Doug on his knees a head taller than most ultraluxury cars or just this one?
The front looks like an angry Mondeo lmao
From the front quarter it looks good. Not excited about the rest of it.
For non English speaker I would like ti subscribe to this channel, even if you do not like cars, and just listen to him and learn the most beautiful sound litters coming from his mouth. You are insane
I’d easily pay $1 Million for a phantom compared to this...
I don't see it...  I want to, but I just don't.  Kind of ugly and not a million dollar car.
I would  definitely dive the car and its maybe cool in anyway  but 1000000 dollar like 10 times an S class Or 3 bentleys or 8 RS7 or.... Many really cool cars
I'm amazed the dealership let you put miles on the car
Looks like a honda accord from gta
you're buying the rarity not the luxury
looks like some car from GTA5, not fun off it
Doug, I have been watching your videos for a long time now, and this is the first time I will write anything. I would just like to thank you for showing us all these interesting cars in your quirky little way! Keep it up
the Garmin killed it for me
I wonder when will car manufacturers realize that wraping everything in leather doesn't increase the quality of the crap behind the leather. Yeah it looks nice(arguably), but it feels cheap.
I don't a million bucks in this car. 200k at best. It's nowhere near the Maybach or the Phantom.
1 mil dollar car and you have to close trunk manually? Seriously??
A million dollar luxury car; An sarcastic review.
I can't believe Aston Martin makes ugly cars too
I designed the press tool for the Bonnet
"You won't really find any Aston Martin Logos anywhere on this car, at least not on display!" --> There is one in the navigation screen for display! You must have missed it...
E38 still the 👑
Dude, a Charger Hellcat looks better and would run circles around it.  For the first time, I’m actually shutting off the video.  Boring.
Lets play a game, drink a shot every time he says: "Taraf".
I'm dissapointed. I was hoping for something like the last Lagonda you reviewed, an absolutely insanely weird but nice luxury car that did some bizarre things nobody else probably thought of. This is nice enough, I guess, but it isn't particularly interesting aside from its status as a million dollar Aston Martin. I don't think it's worth that.
Not much doug sweat included... thanks parking garage...
29:18 Value: 4/10. I think you mistyped 0/10.
Am I the only person who shocked by this fully leather interior? In 21th century u’ve got a fucking chariot fully finished by fucking leather of murdered animals. Like fucking chieftain of ancient fucking tribe. So barbarish. Insane.
I have always loved Aston Martin cars & really like this one!
First video of Doug's that I gave a dislike to.
It´s was made in 2015 and for that, it is really gorgeous. The price will only go up since there are only 120 made. As a collector´s item, it belongs to an insane market.
seems like a car to ride in, and pay for someone to drive.
Only a few cars can pull off the matte paint.  This one looks like it was plasti dipped.
you can get 10 Audis A8 for the same price, and the A8 is 10 times better car than this "leatheruxury" sedan, so Audi gives you 100 times value compared to Ast... Lagondaaaaa (see the badges)
Why everyone saying it looks like an Accord when the front is clearly i8 lookalike?
I was definitely expecting it to be 300,000$ after you said most expensive. This car is not worth 1m.
Garmin, Ford parts wtf Aston!
Ferrari Roma
You'r pronouncing it "taraf" as "giraffe" it is should be "ta raf" where the second "a" is very short  it is only three letters in Arabic "ترف"
Taraf in arabic mean Extravagance also it means luxury
No thank you . Phantom looks better than this car.
expensive hyundai()
Far too much Relicizing, Authenticizing and fetishizing, Doug
The rolls Royce sweeptail is the most expensive sedan ever actually, it goes for a price of 12 million
Doug does an excellent job showcasing this masterpiece.  He's probably best around.  His attention to detail is marvelous (he never misses anything).
When you put a million dollars price tag and everything you want to point out as special is actually available in cars a tenth the price or even less. What a joke.
This car should get a -10 for cool factor. Maybe a +10 for idiot factor if you drop a million on it.  It looks likes someone took  a Cadillac  and slapped a 2000 plymouth ass on it and a 2020 Ford Escape front grill on it.
In Romanian language, taraf means - folk band, consisting mostly of gypsies
Doug, old chap, you've given the Lagonda Taraf (which to me seems like it has a rear end similar to a Renault 12) a 10 for design, and the Aston Martin Rapide just an 8? I think that's a bit unfair. Anyway, de gustibus non disputandum est.
The whole time I was thinking of the houses I could buy with 1 million, not this POS car 🤣
A fridge in the back seat for bottled water is a bit swish
10:15 Hydraulic cylinder like in some tractor xD Mercedes have started using those stepless hinges long time ago without making looking it disgusting.  This car is offensing me.
GTA 5 car? ridiculous!
There is more luxury and tech in a Mercedes s class or any D3 top models for a fraction of the price. Leather ceiling....:-D omg. This car is for a small club of people, who wasted million dollars the same way. Rear view mirror looks like from  opel corsa, dashboard is like from 2005, made out of cheap plastic, partially wrapped in leather. It just does not look that much special and exclusive.
a better pronunciation would be "Tereff" to match the arabic word
For $1M, Aston Martin could/should have totally made special and unique switchgear and displays for this car.
most ugly sedan i ever seen
Looks like a stretched Volvo.
‘A luxury brand of Aston Martin’ . I thought Aston already luxury
Also a 9k € FIAT Panda has a capless fuel door.
BMW E38 is still a better looking sedan. Who is with me??
Is the Centenario review coming? I'm waiting
Maybe a $250k car. Extra $750k is for the leather!
come on bmw is so so much better and the looks of bmw are so so so so much better this thing looks v bmw is nothing
VW wants their front end back for the Arteon, Passat and T6 vans
No wonder The brand went away!!
Ever since I noticed how much Doug's head moves during his videos, I can't unsee it. Doug has his very own "quirk"
This would have definitely won the "overpriced ugliest car" trophy
Plot twist: The car's worth a buck. All the zeros following it are the number of "Lagonda"s
Nothing says million dollar car like the C64 graphics on the dash of what gear you are in.
6:46 looks like a Honda Accord to me :/
"Garfield eats Lasanga in his Lagonda"
the car is ugly 💁
I still prefer a BMW 3 series
looks like a mazda accord
Could use a bit more chrome detailing.  Rear if the car doesn't have much character. The sugar coating tradition of all that tan leather everywhere you look has got old to me. Not enough contrast. Pagani doesn't have that problem. Should have a million dollar ride and some hidden power. The kind that shows up when you floor it at 100 m.p.h. Not easy to do with loners. By the way, is that just plain leather, or Genuine Leather? I noticed the Jaguar in the auction at the beginning. Lots of lux starting in 2000. And those cars go for about 5 grand.
This is a disappointment for $1million Dollars.
Little what behind the front seats..?😂
Aston Martin: oh good the window cleaner is here. Doug: hi I’m here to drive that million dollar car. Aston: oh
Theres one in México. His owner is don huayra.
Are you sure about that
when the key was inserted the screen😂 rip
Doug, try to find and review a Aston Martin One 77 next up!
A dollar more than 250k for this would be overpriced!!!. I dont think they even sold 50% of 120 of this crap!!!... Doug calling TARAF in high pitch is all the attention this car can get!!
What a stupid car
The way it looks is still very subjective. I know better looking sedans than this 1 million dollar baby to be honest. I disagree with Doug there
Crazy to think a rolls royce would be considered a bargain compared to this.
Perforations in the leather is called broguing
This car is worth 130k
If this car is make by Hyundai, doug would have say it's ugly.
First time seeing Doug kneeing for BLM.
It's an ok car, I guess.
Back end looks very Jaguar Xf
I know I am in the minority but I kind of like its looks, It is way too much money though....
Cars and bids sucks. I checked it out yesterday a whole ass 4 vehicles within 300 miles of me, a white 2000 jeep grand Cherokee, a rusty paint 1990 cadillac deville, a 96 lime green acura integra, and a gold 2004 Lexus c300 or whatever its called with 210k  Great inventory.....
Wow, this is one ugly car
Can you look any more like a boy scout ?
I’ll take the Phantom.  And no Doug, it is ugly.
Ford fusion is it you?
For 1 mil, my broke ass thought it would have a shower.
Stupidly expensive no thanks
it look just like the Ford Fusion
Paying $1 million for beauty and exclusivity, but it uses shared parts? A lap dance is beautiful and exclusive and uses shared parts, but I’m not paying $1 million for that.
Reminds me of a maserati quattraporte
Plastic turn signal. Outdated Garmin navigation. Underwhelming tiny interior center buttons. The engine and exterior is amazing, but the interior and features are horrid for $1mil
Am I the only one who thinks the styling is meh?
Front end looks like 👁👄👁
Imagine spending twice as much as a rolls Royce to drive a car that looks like a Chinese knock-off
If they were going to put glass in the middle of the car. They should have made it a hardtop specifically a four-door hardtop with frameless doors and with no b-pillar. That would have made it look so much better.
The brown leather looks awesome - but instead of Black, they should have made it Ivory color - including the steering wheel.
Matte black paint? Thought they stopped that way before 2018. Nice $150k car.
It’s fun to see this million dollar car has the same infotainment and nav system as my son’s 2009 Volvo. 😂
8:49  He is rich in moral character
Looks like a honda front end and Camaro ish rear end
Looks like a Ford Taurus with a rattle can matte paint job.
Aston Martin: Let’s make a $1,000,000 luxury car and make it exclusive by calling it Lagonda and selling it in the Middle East.  Also Aston Martin: Let’s make a Lagonda umbrella to go with it!   😂😂😂😂
god this car is so shitty for its price
I get why they wanted to sell it only in the Middle East, for rich Arabs buying them just to flex
I still think the E38 BMW looks better.  Granted I haven't saw one of these in person
Main storyline: "but it has a Lagonda logo on it"
The car must be little cuz why is he on his knees
This is such a disgrace from Aston Martin. They should be ashamed for putting that Garmin navigation system in a 1.5 million dollar car. It’s light years behind Rolls Royce and even BMW. And on top of that, this thing isn’t even fun to drive. One of the most overpriced cars in history.
feels and looks like an overpriced pos
Not worth price tag ... get the merk s class
Maybe Doug's vision is blurred by the price?
The best thing about this review is the Spyder Centennario 😱😱
Maybe it's just me, but I am not that impressed. It's somewhat...unattractive.
It's a nice Hyundai with a v12 and 1mil pricetag. Aston f***ed It up pretty bad. But someone will buy it, it's brave marketing.
doug is trying desperately hard to sell this car...its not even that beautiful, he definitely gave it his all to sell it
Damn, I would rather have a RR. This car doesn’t really seem that luxurious in comparison. You could use the savings to buy a damn nice house to park it at
Only 120 were built (because thats all Aston Martin could afford to build)
No cooled seats...nice touch
Wonder how much that umbrella in the trunk cost to replace it 😳?
This is not a $1M car. Also, I don’t think it looks that great. As always, great job reviewing Doug. Love your videos. Can’t wait to see your Ford Bronco review.
The most disappointing THING with a million dollar price tag 😐
The shittiest car 1mil can buy
Taraf... More like TARIF. aka TAX!
6:28 Hoaydaaaa
looks like a gta honda accord, this has got to be the worst luxary car ive ever seen and you would think with a one million dollar car you would atleast get a sun roof and cooled seats you know, things pickup trucks have come with for awhile. thank god these things never came to america who would want this overpriced garbage here id rather drive a Lincoln, you can tell doug was paid off to make this video, and i bet this car only cost like 50 to 100 grand to make
*Finally, value, and this is a tough one*
The front of a Passat
I don’t know. This doesn’t talk to me. Looks plain American muscle design. Nothing special, wouldn’t buy it even it was $200K. We will find out in 5 years that this car was a flop.
Looks like a doge challenger from the rear quarter, looks like it’s got VW Arteon headlights/grille. Overall looks like a cheap attempt at making a really expensive car
Looks like a back to the future theme car
Looks like a KIA
i didnt even know this car exists
This cars styling is just weird. Like the designers drawing the concept would have started at the front end and made smooth, flowing lines and once they made it to the back end, they were like nope, let's make it boxy looking with old looking Aston taillights..
I’m sorry but I would not buy this car not even for $100k
What’s with the lack of rear ventilated seats for the car specifically marketed to the Middle East (where it’s hot)?
I am sure you have put alot of effort into this video, but the car seems to be, in many aspects, much worse that "typical" luxury cars. In fact, I found many aspects to be rather frustrating and even cheap, Ipads? honestly?
If i was driving the rolls i would laugh at the mug who bought a million dollar aston thats trying to be a rolls. Also the most beautifull 4 door luxury limo is probably the mercedes 600
There’s a million better ways to spend a million dollars besides buying this atrocity. Even my 07 Lexus has a sunroof and cooled seats WTH. It is definitely interesting to look at though.
Imagine my Altima having a better infotainment system lol
so they add a wine cooler for a car designed to be used in the middle east... max they'd be cooling down is a bottle of rose water or milk
I swear I made this exact car (okay, probably as a coupe) in supercar street challenge back in the day.
Not impressed at all for a million-dollar no!
Very biased review 😬
"... this feature is very common of Aston Martins of this era..."  This is a 2018 million dollar car! Why does it have anything from a previous era?
No ... just no
If someone does not understand why Aston Martin struggled financially in the last few years, show them this video. This is not a million dollar car, and needless to say, having a different grill to other manufacturers wont cut it anymore as "great design languague". A 7 series blows this thing any day of the week.
It's ugly. But I guess,  when you have money you find beauty where  there isn't.
“Looks really different than just about anything else.” IT’S A HONDA ACCORD DOUG
Nice Chevy Camaro
Honda accord x Ford Fusion
Am I the only one who think it looks kinda.... ugly?
“For this era”. It’s a 2018 not a 1998
doug said "1 million dollar car" about 20 times in this video
It looks like a Ford Fusion from the front.
it just regular aston with more leather..
Review the 2020 Audi RS7-R
This car wasnt worth 1m new. Having only 120 built doesnt mean its good, if you use that logic any company can do that. put some limited 100 series and put insane sticker price. Car isnt even that good looking, hell Mazda6 looks better and its 1/30 of the price. I would rather spend <200k on some s63 AMG than 1m on this and for rest buy RR and other 200k for Ferrari
If this was the new 7 series I'd tell them the front looks cheap. It looks like a Japanese car made for the American Market.
Beautiful and I think it takes styling cues from the 70's/80's Lagonda. Very subtle!!
I have to admit, the rear looks stunning. The rest looks terrible
I don't know why I'm saying this but there is some lack of premiumness in some parts of this car  like the car color doesn't matches with the interior in the dash the panel in which garmin system's installed could have been better what I felt in here was that the panel was quite small and boxy.Now coming to the speakers I really like them .On the other hand indactor system behind the steering wheel something different could have been used, behind the astray a circular button was there a little more attention could have been paid in designing that . In the trunk  the refrigator part why would someone keep that open it might just get damaged if someone tries to put in their luggage unmindfully. Well, this are the few things that I found  which could be taken care of  and  my opinion might vary with others. Last but not the least Aston Martin is a big automobile company people working in it are far more experienced than me I guess they can take care of this. Thank You
the front look like a stretched ford focus
Beautiful car, no doubt. But not worth a million dollars by any measure.
$1,000,000 car. Look at that beautifully designed front license plate holder.
this review is a shame
The fact you pay $1,000,000 for a car and you have to get your own tv screens (iPads) 😐.
A crappy nonsense 1 mil. dollar Genesis. Only retards buy this.
The weird sharp point in the window line doesn't suit this car at alll
At least you can fold that nav screen down. I wish more cars had that. Not everybody needs or wants all that crap. In other news, what will Aston Martin do when it finds out somebody was in that car in a t-shirt? Seems like a suit and tie should be required.
This hideous car can’t touch the E38 BMW in terms of beauty
That matt black on cars always looks like the car is halfway through its coating. Like it just needs the gloss overcoat. he he
"this was what aston martin had at the time". He says like it was launched 15 yrs ago. It's 2020 dude, there nos justification for such a crapy "navigation system" (not even infoteinment)
damn, people really are paying a mil for this pile of shit
This as is a shame for the luxury segment, Gee. Doug took too easy on the review
Ok enough doug...wheres the punch line?
Doug's jaw must've hurt after this one
Are you sure that's not a Dodge Charger that's had some dodgy bodywork done on it?
Looks like a Chrysler
I dont care how much it costs...i still wouldnt buy one. No wonder aston didnt want their name on it. What a joke of a car.
Nice but I don't like the red brake calipers. Doesn't match the rest of the car.
A taraffic review
10:02 😂 Just be honest Doug.
Wait heated seats and an umbrella, for a car marketed for the middle east. Are they stupid or being ironic at Aston Martin?
Looking at the technological features it is a magnificent 2008 luxury vehicle 👌   Oh wait it is 2016!!!
Umm... those are Dodge Charger SXT wheels 😐 overpriced doesn’t even begin to explain how stupid this car is
Here is you're $1million Aston Martin Rapide.
This car is a joke haha
Lada Vesta had that front grille back in 2017
I'm a car guy and didn't know this existed 😷
Idk why but I though of a Camry when I saw the wheels...
I see some chrysler 200 in there.
So this isn't a million dollar car, it just costs a million dollars because crazy rich middle eastern people will pay it
Imagine paying a million dollars for a car and getting a Ford turn stalk, sat/nav, a backward gauge, unprotected fridge, ugly clips for iPads, and an special umbrella for those peaky Arabian thunderstorms.
This guy is so boring and so much struggling while talking 🤮🤮🤮
Not bad $1 million for A car that looks like a Ford fusion especially in the front end
Those Arabs must be so proud of their million dollar Ford Focus turn signal stalk.
Looks like overpriced Ford sedan
THISSSS is a million dollar Hyundai Genesis!
single most beautiful car? I personally think it's just meh and not interesting at all and I usually like most new cars
This car is not worth a million dollars, I would much rather buy a fully loaded Rolls Royce.
They only made one hundred and twenty for the entire *plane
BORING!!!
What are these windows in the hood for?
Aston Martin is a leather car interior designer company. They don't spare their leather.
Orange interior
Sheldon Cooper with PhD in Automobile
My favorite quirk/feature of this $1 million car is the $50 pop-up speaker option. How nice.
I kept watching until the end and still haven't found out what makes it cost 1 mil $. I feel like this was made only to just to rip off rich arab business magnates. The front reminds me of a Ford Mondeo or a new Honda Accord. The back is nothing special. The interior is just plain dull compared to a Mercedes S Class for example, or a Rolls Royce.   I find it weird odd Doug keeps saying it's "oh so beautiful and luxurious". Compared to what cars he reviewed in the past, it's not that special.
World’s most retarded name
This looks like a Ford Fusion🤨
I’d just get a nice E38 7 Series
I hope you see this Doug! I was hoping Cars and Bids could begin including older cars as well. I’ve loved some of the old Mercedes Diesels (240D) offered on the site but I’d like to see older models too. I see cars and bids as a site that offers a “moment in time”. Cars well preserved that are considered extremely cool even to this day. Is there a reason you cut cars off in the 1980s?
why is no one talkin about the lambo
Is it just me or is this the Ford Taurus's Successful cousin
Car is kind of Dookie better off buying a Rolls-Royce for literally half the price
That quilting under the hood.
Aston Martin or ‘loganda’ should take a look at Bentley flying spur for interior quality and infotainment system design. This feels like.an antique collectors item already.
1M$ and I get a Ford Focus turn signal stock?  Really? REALLY??
Taraf in Arabic actually translates to:  of something or someone. side; a group of people of a certain allegiance or adherence.
Doug nearly gave me a heart attack switching from the Taraf to the CarsAndBids bit with a bright  blue Centenario roadster Pops out faster than a zit
The front looks like the 2021 Hyundai Elantra - especially the grill-headlights combo!
to be fair though..If you have managed to make a million dollars to waste on this car..you probably know where you are going and don't need a common old sat nav at all..
Stupid car for stupid rich guys
Ugly
Lagonda is a river in Springfield, Ohio,  btw.
I'm convinced this is a joke! ... the video and the car!
10% review 90% Laaagonda
What a waste of money
Astin martin paid for this review or doug was their hostage throughout the review
Reminds me of a Genesis. Which would be better made and more reliable.
You, Doug, have the best job in the world. Driving around in your Kia Stinger to drive around in different types of vehicles. Enjoying the sunshine of California, the last week of summer...I just hope you appreciate (in your private moments, off camera) how lucky you are to be doing what you do #thegrassisgreenerontheotherside
Dodge Charger 😂
Why are the door hydraulics visible? Weird for this price
0:44 oh damn, who’s forza build is that
Why is this a million dollars lol
The interior is shit , its like they copied honda civic , but the exterior is priceless
I wouldn't want to be the salesman.
Yugoslavia
looks like a Maserati though !
They just turned the old grill upside down and added lights on the left and right uper side
Everybody is roasting this car in the comments and I'm still not satisfied with how shitty it is. I love Aston Martin, but this? WTF is this? A joke? Ugly, not even basic technology, recycled interior... I'd rather have a beautiful C63s from 2015 than this and burn the rest of the money if I had to choose and couldn't resell.  It honestly offends me Doug is calling this car beautiful.
Maybach S: Laughs :)
They let you drive a $1000000 car, so what happens if someone run up the back of you?
Observation: Most people in the comments are INTENSELY pissed off by this car and its price
This is the most dissapointing 1m car in the world
I'd rather have a fiat
It looks like a gta car
What a cancer
WTf is this?
11:12  or you can buy a disco 1 2 3 4
What a piece of shit car, you can buy 4 new Bentley Flying Spurs for this
Hm... have been watching and waiting for that ultimate bombshell to justifiy the price. But when all was said and done, one simply has to remark: For 1 000 000 USD you should expect a lot more.
TARAAAAF
I dont see the 1 million dollar in this car. I would buy a maybach or s class mercedes instead of this in this price category. Those cars gives me much more than this.
Your exagerating allittle bit .a s63 is abought similar luxury for 100k . Why u spend 1 million for a astonmartin?
It seems like a FORD Taurus
Doug the type of guy to get roasted in his own comments section
Absolute wastage of money. Not at all worth the price tag it claims. Not even close..... Dissappointing.
Outside screams 2018 inside screams 2010
Looks like a Ford mondeo...
I like Audi sedan designs more that this 🤔
Doug likes cars......
it kinda looks like a honda civic and a hellcat had a baby
Of course!!! It had to be made for the Arab market cause a million is basically 10k to them. I bet you this minute that a few of the Arabs that bought this waste of a million drove it for just a week then abandoned it to the family Nanny or their 14yr old kid that owns a golden AK and rare sneaker that cost 20k or its been abandoned at one of their deserts. I honestly see no difference in this car and properly built European cars under 200k, my 2015 Cayenne Turbo is equally as well built with a prescision engine the gives same 500 horse plus
Kinda looks like a charger
Did anybody else catch the Centenario he was standing behind?
i would rather buy a s63 amg
Disliked this sponsored dishonest review.
how many times can u say the most beautiful car Bro for a million dollars it should blow you while it drives itself
This car is the biggest load of bullshit, Doug would've normally called this out but it seems like he's finding excuses to justify the price tag
it's actually quite an ugly duckling. Definitely not a classic
how much did you get not to rost this stupid Car !!! come on it is pretty stupid and has nothing special, it is Money laundering for the Mafia in Dubai and Riyadh
I just got my Aston Martin for a way cheaper price from the Best car plug thank you @LORODVADER telegram
It can be rare, but is not that luxurious, is not that pretty, it is not close to a great car performance and at the end of the day it's a total scam just for having LAGONDA TARAF by name.
I hate to burst his bubble, but my 2012 MB S63 had the same variable door stops for only $147K. And there was no exposed shock.
Finaly the value. This is the tuff one..... as always xD
This is possibly the most cringey review yet, dough worthy
The funny thing is the part of the exterior design I don't like is the rear end....LOL
million dollar car, but not a LICK of window tint. triggered from afar
My God congratulations...... You have THE WORLD'S MOST ANNOYING VOICE AND SPEAKING STYLE
Doug was way to kind to this car
imagine asking 1 mil for a car and u can't even protect the fridge in some kind of case
No folding picnic tables in back, no Alexa in front. No fine cabinetry or paneling anywhere. The interior is OK, but nowhere near the interior of a late 1970s Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham, Lincoln Town Car or Chrysler New Yorker Brougham. For a million bucks, I want the entire interior done in blond pussy hair. And because Doug drove this car all day long, all over town, for your million, you get a used Taraf.
This ugly car does nothing for me. If I was ultra rich I would buy as many of these ugly things as I could and have them crushed. Good on Aston Martin for really sticking it to the stupid stupidity rich.
nah, its not that good looking, and definitely overrated
what does one go for now?
Well when you have to cover something (which is literally nothing) to get those views and give the video a click bait tittle as if it is everything. blah!!
This Is The Most Beautiful Piece Of Machine I've Seen
Why not buy a rolls Royce and a Ferrari if you want the best of both😂
Mercedes-Benz maybach long wheel base is way better
Doug is definitely payed to promote this, surely. There's nothing here that says a million dollars. Cool factor 9? Styling 10? What?
Looks like they extended a Honda Accord
The fact that this is an Aston Martin, is kind of a head scratcher.... Who spends one million dollars on a sedan they would normally have someone drive as a chauffeur? Aston Martin makes drivers cars.
The batman mobile 2021...
Looks like rolling Concept car
It kinda looks like a Ford fusion from the front
That would be the day .   Ill take the new Vette and Ram for winter driving.
Let’s face it. This car is made only for middle easters that have more servants than we have family members and more wealth than our entire neighborhood ten times over. It’s overpriced because they’re customers don’t care.
This is the Cadillac of Austin Martin. Like the Imperial of Chrysler
Overpriced and dumb but it looks sooo eeeevil
I had to check to make sure this wasn't an April Fools joke. Cant imagine anyone paying 1 mil for this thing
I can't tell if you actually like it or are just trying to stay on O'Gara's nice-list
Looks like a giant turd with the hips from a dodge Challenger. You'd have to be a Aston enthusiast to want one
Leave it to England to charge a million dollars for an $80,000 car.
This car is in between a ford escort and a honda civic.. it's has nothing special at all. It's just a big joke that it cost twice the price of a Phantom. Doug you are definitely paid by this company to enjoy this car ..!
Okay why wouldn't you buy a Rolls or Bentley? That would be cheaper and better. Also it would be much more distinctive. I mean I would buy a Lexus if I was trying to get luxury but not attention.
West coast customs can make it for less than 100k
Doug, the type of guy to use a trash compactor to crunch a soda can. Doug, the type of guy to turn on both the driver and passenger seat heaters even though he's driving alone. Doug, the type of guy to put tire shine on the wheels of his air compressor. Doug, the type of guy to use adaptive cruise cruise control in his own neighborhood. Doug, the type of guy to ask for the receipt for a pack of Tic Tacs. Doug, the type of guy to step over a dollar to pick up a penny.
Hopefully you will rewiewing our car TOGG 🇹🇷🇹🇷
I think the Rolls Royce Phantom is more luxurious.
So, a Ford Fusion and a Honda Accord had a million dollar child...and it's not pretty.  The glass B pillars are brilliant, so there's that.
28:44 I noticed that you could definitely store your tube of toothpaste in those door gaps.
Stupid design.. Honda accord is better. Low class design..
This type of door handles is a waste
Doug is the type of guy to drive about $850,000 of depreciation off a million dollar car in just a few minutes of reviewing the world's most "expensive luxury sedan". 🤷
How can the value score be anything other than a 1 or 2?
Looks like something from gta.
This is for billionaires and celebrities that want an Aston Martin that people will mistake for a toyota camry, without having to buy a toyota camry.
Beautiful
16:25 you're telling me i paid a million dollars for this car and i am getting those turn signal stocks I can get better turn signal stocks from a 2002 nissan sentra
It looks like a Ford Taurus
Looks like a mix between a Ford Taurus and Chrysler 300. I guess they forgot to add a sunroof. That’s very special. Next!
The Accord and the Camaro had a baby with a horse face.
That car on GTA cheaper then that 😂
Doug is the type of guy to still use Yahoo mail.... Wait, he actually does.😭
Give me a 10th gen accord, 30k cash and 2 weeks of time
Made for the "middle east". Of course. That's the only region in the planet where you can find people with more money than brains.
do a video on the cobalt ss
Overpriced piece of crap
Doug was obviously paid by someone to hype up this hideous overpriced monstrosity.
Grille as ugly as Lexus SUV. Otherwise nice style.
Who else think it look like shit?
Who ever came up with price needs to be fired.
What most people fail to mention is that this car was designed and built by the same team that made the One-77 and Vulcan. As well It also has quite a lot of carbon fiber structural and body components.   It is difficult for any company to develop a car of this level for less than $100M with all of the design work and tooling. So only selling 120 examples of these most likely means it did not produce a high profit margin.  All of that being said, not worth the price tag.
Im willing to pay 40,000 usd for it, will be repainting it also
Wtf it actually looks like an accord
I’ve never seen a car so grossly overpriced.
The lines of the car just dont look right... Especially the hooked line at the back door  The design doesnt make sense: some mix of an Aston Martin and a Masserati Quatrroporte.  When I see it, it makes me think of the movie “The Fly”. This car looks like “Brundlefly”
I tried to buy a no reserve car on Doug's Cars and Bids website for $50 and then he took $250 from me as a fee for 4 days until the auction was over and I was unable to feed myself. Thank god I am still alive. Doug is my new Master
actual production labor and materials probably amounts to 200 grand,  so mafia bosses and cartel kingpins use this aberration of car for money laundering...
Went to Cars and Bids and it tells me my zip code is invalid. Doug the type of guy to know my actual zip code.
ترف ❌ تيراف ✅
just let that dude be in the future, his wifey said didnt need you then dont need you later, and dont need you later."im the man who wears the pants"
10 for styling lmao it looks like trash. body shapes are way off
Doug why ya face all swollen?
Looks like a Mazda.
Thatveganteacher is typing...
This looks like a gtaV version of a luxury car
Trash
Trash
Trash
Million bucks and you still get to enjoy $500 oil changes no doubt
Beautiful car but talking à lot
Give me a Mercedes S-Class 550, pocket the change n call it a day...
Dough, u r so fascicious!
Thats some gta online pricing
Maserati Quattroporte...
It’s not $1,000,000 beautiful. What a joke.  Remove the badge take the car out in public and ask people how much they think the price is. You won’t get a guess over $100k
Looks like a million $$ Ford Taurus
24:18 strange sound inside the car!!! I live in middle east and i can say that Aston Martin is not reliable and no demand for such waste of money.
I just find the styling to be more than a little boring. I wouldn't notice it if it was parked next to me. The interior does look nice. Oh well, to each their own.
This car is ugly, just looks like new Honda Accord, with bigger size, engine, better material and a ROYAL logo
I'm looking forward to Samcrac finding one at auction.
Why isnt it painted??
Doug the type of guy to review the bronco?
When it comes to automobiles turning indicators are always amber, not orange
most outdated car I've ever seen.
what a scam
A very ugly looking car
Overpriced Genesis.
Looks like a big ass Chrysler. Big POS.
10:23 no soft close?
the front looks like a Ford Fusion
just like the old lagonda, this one is ugly. i can't believe you rated this a 10
V12 with only 530BHP? Really underpowered for a $1m car
Doug wears cargo shorts exclusively always matched with goodwill t-shirts so its no surprise his opinion on beauty is particular
Those nails Doug, those nails, please...
looks like the new ford mondeo from the front
Wow, a grossly overpriced ford fusion limo.
This is an "intensely beautiful car". A bigly beautiful car. The most beautiful car. So much beauty you'll say no more, no more beauty. Meanwhile, I think the early 2000s Jag sedan exterior is more stunning and unique.
Stupid car with crazy price i will buy 5 mercedes s class cars with that 1 m
Definitely NOT the most good looking 4 door sedan 😂
The m8 is way better though doug
Looks like the cars I used to draw when I was a kid
I rather buy a house and a Honda rather than buy this and lose my shit with the maintenance
I dont get the thing with the door holding. I tested my Mazda and it does it. The door holds wherever i want it. Am I missing something?
rear be lookin like a mazda 3
it look like a Dodge charger and a Chrysler 300 had a baby, and that baby had a 1night stand with a Ford focus, and that baby lucked up and married an Aston Martin. Just weird all around. $1 millon with the dashboard of a 2005 VB11. $1 millon with Forx focus headlights and for what, because the seatbelt has leather pockets and the roof is stitched in leather, which is ugly by the way. They did't give you customized screens in the back, you have to add your iPad, $1 million. that info system looks like a 08 Pontiac Solstice. this car is a mess
6:20 HONDA ACCORD team files a law suit against Aston Martin lol!
What about the Koeinsegg gemera
I'm sure the car itself know it's not worth a million bucks
Let's all give this video a dislike to show Doug that this is another Honda Accord REBAGED with a Anston Martin logo
Ledeis and gentleman we proudly present.. The BRITISH HONDA ACCORD !
9:55 Bruh my old S70 from 97 does that just because the door is broken so it is not fucking special and not 1mil dollars special like fuck this car its so bad and pointless for that unrealistic amount of money
How are basic rear LED lights that go from red to amber luxury? Grasping at straws?
Molto bella ma mi aspettavo uno schermo di bordo molto più grande come già in altre macchine
1M$ just because of rarity with that ugly styling really ? So if theres one honda accord in the world just because of that it will be worth 1M$ ? Doug thats not you and i think something is wrong.
$1Mill lux sedan, a $90k Genesis has more features
Is anyone else really disappointed in this car for 1 mil? A $200k Maybach S class has twice as many features.
I ended up watching a couple of more car videos trying to justify the price of the car..
Doug do the 2021 genesis gv80 suv we know once it comes out will be the suv of the year
looks like a honda accord from the front... no where near worth 1 million my  2012 3 series  has better tech and more features smh
do the WAP dance
Hi Doug,  this is Aston Martin, would you like to make an easy $50 000? We have a car $150 000 car that we're struggling to sell, we need you to convince someone to pay $1 million for it
The Lagonda from the ‘80s is way more distinctive. Even to this day. IMO
looking like a dodge and an aston had a child
for that price it better also have a built in feature that blows you off while sitting in the back
Right size ? Yes . Worth a mill ? Not even close 250 at most. Old tech, parts from ford. I'm sure if they make it again it will be better
0:38 ...  A Lambo, painted to look like a Bugatti Chiron..........
Those red callipers do not work at all
the front kinda looks like a honda accord
cant help but laugh at all the people who have so much negative things to say about a car they'll never own.
All I can say is L O L
So this is what a super villian drives?
OMG it has wheels , very luxurious ,omg and leather wtf is this doug . I don t get it , you are trying to fool yourself or us ?
The logic of this review is disturbingly circular. The car is valuable because it's exclusive. It's exclusive because it's rare. It's rare because it's expensive. So it's valuable...because it's expensive? So you could charge literally anything and the price would be self-justifying!
This is one of the most beautiful cars I have ever seen in my life.
😆Looks like the 2001 Mitsubishi galant.
Radio was tuned to talk sport( U.K.  station)on dab. Is dab a thing in the US?
A million doll hairs?
they put a god damned door stopper on the car. oh god.
scotty's 94 celica would still outrun this.
What... I just checked your channel wondering why you have not uploaded in a while and... I was not subscribed. de faq. Youtube... what is your deal ?!
Somebody used that key as a bottle opener
My $2,000 Audi A8 had an automatic closing trunk unlike this "mIlLiOn dOlLaR cAr"
BMW i8 Sedan Edition
it looks like an expensive Mazda 3
17:36 Made in Mexico.  HAHA.
Am I the only one who gets new Honda Accord vibes
10:02  Doug: "The door will stay exactly there" Door: Closes
"You are paying $1M for rarity"??? So Toyota can make a shitty car, but make 100 of them and price them at $1M? What a bunch of crap. Look at the turn signal stock at 16:30. I have a nicer one in my 5K car... You get a nicer steering wheel in a 30K entry level Mercedes..
As much as I love super expensive and high-performance sedans, this is just too much (in terms of price in comparison to performance and luxury). I would rather spend 1 million on a 918 or a P1
Someone : why is this car so expensive... Aston Martin : Leather Someone : How fast does it go? Aston Martin : Leather Someone : how much does it cost? Aston Martin : Leather Someone : Which engine does it have? Aston Martin : Leather Someone : What about safety? Aston Martin : Leather *Someone asking literally any question* Aston Martin : Leather
hi Doug there actually 2 Taraf legonda in North America. This one and 1 white one in mexico city its owned by a Mexican car colector his name is Don Huayra  you can find him in instagram
Unpopular opinion, this car is gorgeous, The price is disgusting,  But the car itself is beautiful
Rear end styling is nice but it has an accord front end. Seriously?
This, coupled with the Valkyrie, makes the most hideous looking monstrosity duo in the entire history of humans! The old and new DBS are just otherworldly stunning though.
Looks like Mazda 6
Looks like a Honda to me !
Meh. Looks like a Ford Fusion and Honda Accord had a baby. Doesn't look all that special.
It’ looks like a Ford Taurus.. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Looks like mazda 6
Underwhelming
How many times he said LAGONDA🤣🤣
Highly disappointed... Nothing extraordinary 😐
Doug can review a screw and still talk about it for 30 minutes.
Only thing I like is the rear
The car looks so hideous that I had to watch a Rolls Royce video to bring my faith over luxury.
If I was filthy rich I'd want this car simply because it's really rare and nobody has it.  But it doesn't have the presence of a rolls Royce.
Looks like Fujitive in GTA5
It's just rapid rip off to loot oil sheiks.
Looks like Honda S660
The only thing that justifies the price tag is the fact that less than 200 of these are available around the globe. Other than that..  I'd prefer a Honda civic.
I'm sorry Aston martins, luxury brand.. Really...
The E38 will come and haunt you in your dreams...... forever
not impressed. this is worth MAX $100.000 not 1M lol
Looks 👎🏻
that colour is hideous
I think the novelty and price tag have done much to contribute to this car getting "the most beautiful sedan" praise. The back looks too small from some angles, but too bland from others. A lot of design elements are taken from other Aston Martin models that look a bit lazy. I think they could have designed a better light bar specifically for this car that would have complimented the design a bit better. It's a nice looking car, but I think after the novelty wears off the car will still be beautiful, but perhaps not the most beautiful sedan ever made.
Not that impressive except the inside is the same color as my hellcat. Of course the Hellcat could whoop this cars ass!
25 minutes into the video and I realized you get no sunroof!
This looks like a if AM made a Mazda - look at the chrome around the front grill for example.
1 Million+ Dreamcar and no sunroof? What idiot has ordered that?
10:38...The look Doug gives the owner of this car when asked, "Why are you sitting in my car shooting a video?"
This really looks like a car from GTA5
Most boring car ever
I really don't see it's beauty and actually think this car is rather ugly. Even if I was a billionaire this thing would not clog up my garage. And the price is just ridiculous.
OMG .... a leather roof!!!..... Hate it .... I am suffocating looking at those interiors.....I don't have travel sickness but I sure am throwing up in this one...yuckkkkk
They really want to get rid of this lol
Looks like if ford made a concept of the fusion. Ugly and basic imo.
This car looks pretty outdated. You gotta be a billionaire and an idiot to buy this car
Doug is the type of guy to say Distinctive 8374837483748 times in a minute
Ugliest car produced by Aston Martin
How to waste 1 million dollars
Touch screen is imported from old laganda I guess.
Completely Unimportant But Doug The Same Size Of The Car On His Knees. 😂😂😂
not to hate but to me it doesn't look that good 😄
It's nice, not $1M nice...
No ventilated rear seats in a car that was intended for the middle east? Seems like a massive oversight.
Genesis will make same car for 60k and will add a 100k miles warranty to it  lolol
Without a doubt one of the worst ‘luxury’ car designs in history. No thought or consideration at all.
it looks like a car GTA 5 would have :)
that interior looks so 2005 haha. Whoever buys this car, deserves to lose his money :D
OMG, looking from the side and back this car is hideous AF! There are no proportions at all :O
Very luxurious.... hydraulic spring just randomly exposed at bottom of door frame... 1 million huh? A car designed by assholes for assholes. 6 litre v12 producing 530hp? Garbage. You're not paying for the luxury... you're paying for the 'rarity'? The hell does that even mean? I honestly feel like you're just trying to make longshot justifications for the price of this dumpster fire.
The Ford Fusion has really come a long way.
Awful price, totally not worthy ! Better to buy a phantom and a lambo and still save some money to spend! Totally overpriced car!
It's a torque converter automatic, not a single clutch robotised manual.
If this dude points out another Lagonda badge, I swear.
taraf means anything but Ultimate luxury in arabic, its not your fault doug , its aston missing the translation up
From the back, it looks like 31,490 Dodge Charger bro🤣🤣
Doug is in the big leagues. O'Gara let you drive a million dollar car? Do you have to buy your own insurance for the DAY!!!???
1 Million for this?🤣🤣🤣 This cant be real guys.
Rolls Royce is Way Better
Surprised this doesn't have a sunroof!
Let’s all talk about the price! How freakin predictable....Aston Martin is a tiny company that hardly makes a profit and very often makes a loss but still manages to produce gorgeous cars that can compete (not beat) with monsters in the industry. When/If this firm bows out gracefully in a few years the car industry will miss its individuality and beauty.
1mil and doesn’t have a sunroof....
And now, 2 years later, its worth 300k. Rubbish
Am I the only one that see some Dodge Challenger in the rear end?  ALso, front end still looks like a 2012 Ford Fusion.
No thank you rolls Royce look more aggressive .
Can’t stand the way he talks..  can’t get thru the first few mins of any video he makes..
The rarity alone makes it intriguing. They made 120 of these and this is the only one on the continent.
A S-Class is more luxurious
THAT KEYHOLE!!!!!!
Looks like shit......stick with e38 7 series
Anyone else baffled with the "most beautiful 4 door of all time" statement? Are we being punked?
arteon has better design
Screw Exclusivity 1million dollars is absolutely ridiculous, the tech is outdated, basically everything about it is old gen even if it came out 2018 automobiles such as Audi, Bentley ,BMW, Mercedes etc....have amazing tech and build quality which even today is still good i would buy a s8 or 750i or s63 amg for 150k and still have ultimate luxury with alot of change to spare
Looks like a hyundai genesis. Not really an aston martin. This brand is slowly dying
It must be some kind of a joke!  Outdated multimedia, displays with cheap graphics, controversial design. A decade behind the other luxury brands. What are you paying for?
Wonder how the depreciation has effected it?
Ngl the rapide is just all around better looking, than this thing...
Doug had to get his knees dirty before he got in.
Chutiye
0:38 can someone tell me what that Lambo is? it looks like a Centenario mixed with a Huracan, it looks.... impressive.
Hahahahah the more I watch this video the worse this car becomes 😂😂😂
What will arab say after buying  the new car !
It's a complete shit. Just take a panamera executive, and you will be good.
Sorry, but this car isn't that beautiful! - At best 8 out of 10...
This car is such hilariously over priced dogshit, it doesn't even look good IMO.  Also I find it hilarious that the emblem on the child seat anchor panels appears to show an anchor strangling a child.
What a garbage.
Am i alone in thinking this car isnt that good looking?
Literally gta 5 pricing😹
Give me Mercedes-Benz S400L AMG 2021 and keep this garbage ♻️
THIIIISS is stupid multimedia and tacho ever in overpriced car! Design also 7 from 10.
That B&O speaker is not only a speaker, it's a microphone that measure the cabin and adjust the sound if there are 1 or more persons in the car...
how would you review the world most expensive luxury car? doug: watch and learn 8:48
Sooo... The Rolls Royce sweptail is not the most expensive car in the world, even if it is worth 12 million.
No moonroof 🤔 Fixed rear seats 🤔🤔 Awful rear tablets 🤔🤔🤔  Looks nice though I guess 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
‌
I think the word Taraf translates to, "Terrific waste of Money," in Farsi.
I dont see difuser, active spoiler, vents in front of wheels and proper fender behind, no hybird... is it even carbon fiber?
What's a waste of money. The car does not do  justice with the price they are asking.
My friend audi s8 2020 its the best sedan ever made !! ;) This is crap for this kind of money !!
Hey Doug, my uncle watches your show and his childhood dream is to get a 1987-90 Chevy Cavalier, with the digital dash. I was hoping you could review one for him. Thank you.
He must be trolling. He even mentions the ford taurus, which is the first thing that came to my mind when looking at this cars' front end.
When u have a hell lot of money and dunno what to do....? Tadaa.... There u have it Aston Martin Lagonda.
This car attitude take you back on the 80’s
Way too complimentary a review of a car that carries that price tag and still has Ford Focus parts that are consumer-facing. Total joke. This car is designed for money laundering and hiding cash.
This reminds me of Matt Damon in Syriana - “Keep playing, keep buying yourself new toys, keep spending $50,000 a night on your hotel room, but don't invest in your infrastructure... don't build a real economy. So that when you finally wake up, they will have sucked you dry, and you will have squandered the greatest natural resource in history.”
I’m glad Aston didn’t make this a production car. It looks like an American Ford sedan that costs $30,000. The luxury things in this car are not expensively made. It is no where near the price range, I struggle to believe that Aston made this, it does not have British bespoke. It has a cheap Chinese businessman sedan written all over it
it costs a thousand thousands but you don't even get a moonroof. plus, it's got those lame tiny screens at the rear. and for that price, I also want 20in. MacBooks that fold in and out above the rear sleeves.
How we see a video of that lambo ???
Styling looks like it was designes by an amateur
The Car ist absouloutly overpriced
Doug, you totally dig sexy & sleek luxury/sports sedans, like myself. You should consider reviewing some more Infiniti models, especially the handsome & comely Q70L (preferably the 5.6V8 version).  The Q's interior, though anything but dull, can't really hold much of a candle to that found in this Lagonda, but just spend enough time around that banging bodywork, and tell me that's not one head turning Nippon-sleeper. 😲😍
Yeah in the gulf countries people love large luxury sedans  I personally think its elegant , beautiful and luxurious but very overpriced it's not worth it
Pretty sad that my 2016 Audi A6 has like 10x more technology, better GPS, two screens, more car settings, better looks and at like 1/25th of the price
5:56 - 2005 VW Passat: Hold my washer fluid
this car is expensive for its exclusivity and amazing design, not solely as a luxury item. as a designer myself, i have to say its probably the most elegant looking car there is out there. calm ur ass people.
why don't you just spec out an RR
Does anyone else see a Ford Taurus   front end? Funny he even mentioned the name 🤣
such a waste of 1.000.000 USD, who would wanna buy this outdated car for so much money.
22:42 no cap?
So: No sunroof No unique infotainment system and display No fancy electric seat adjustments No extra leg room No leg extensions on the seats No numerical indicator for temperature in the back seats No large trunk/boot space Generic plastic ford turn stocks Poorly placed P R N D buttons No seat massagers No improved car performance
1 million $  Aston for the scheichs in the hot middle East  . . . . and no cooled rear seats!
I'd rather have a new vantage for 1/7 the price tbh. Oh and only 30 hp less :3
A million dollar worth car that has the same control panel of its minor model, a turn signal stock from a Ford, manual door handles, exposed refrigerator motor in the trunk, no sunroof, plastic buttons on the steering wheel, stock navigator, has the Lagonda logo engraved on the ashtray, on the key fob, on the umbrella handle (!), on the engine inspector bagde but not on his engine cover? So where the million dollar worth go? For a third of that price I would chose a Bentley Continental Supersport, with over 200 HP more and almost twice the amount of torque, not mentioning the MUUUCH nicer quality. What happened to Aston Martin? DB9 was such a nice car!
My $800 car have sunroof but million dollar car don't 😄😄
that paint is stunning
LOL $1 million dollar of garbage sedan
What a ugly car
I can't agree, it is not pretty at all. It does look bizzare as the one you mentioned. I see yet another overpriced luxury car haha. A 2018 Genesis G80, which is far more cheaper,  offers a lot more equipment than that weird as well as slightly outdated car. Furthermore, that car has got quite a bit of buttons in the center consol. Nice review, though.
What a s*** box LMFAO
Complete waste of time
This vehicle doesn't look $1,000,000
This is pathetic, there is nothing about this car thats worth 1 mil. I get it, it's made for a Saudi prince thats bored and wants to spend money just to do it. And I'm fine with that. What I'm not fine with is the fact that aston can't even beat out cars that cost 1/4 this price. Interior? Yeah that can be beat by the 760i, s class, s8, lc500 and any rolls or Bentley. Performance? Nothing to see here. Styling?  It looks like a god damn ford fusion!  The lc500 is so much more beautiful, along with any rolls or Bentley.
$1m car for a Garmin navigation system... I’ll pass
Is it Fod Fusion Astom Martin edition?
Nice Volvo...👍🏼💯😎🦇
It looks like a Ford
Beauty is always in the eye of the beholder, but damn, that's an ugly car. Looks like a Volvo from the 80s. For 1 million? Ha!
So it was made for the Middle East Market but they didn't think it would be a good idea to put AC seats in the vehicle?
For a vehicle costing over 1M, it's extremely underwhelming. Should be priced around $400k.
Looks like a VW arteon. Aston martins are rubbish
I would take a Phantom or a Ghost over this any day lol
I didn't get why the car cost 1 million. I left before the video ended. I would like to think it flies
Only a complete moron would pay anywhere near a million dollars for this car.
Ohhh thank you Mr Bill Gates for the show and display law!
Ugly.
Now i dont like any Aston Martin.
Dude are you serious? It's so frucking ugly. It's doesn't surprise me that doug likes the look of this cars. Its quirky lmao
Cut a 0 from the price and you have a deal. For 1 million dollars it should be 10 times the car it is.
This guy is annoying
I'm back to seeing his videos after 3 years
At 1 million, what have I seen inside there that I can't get in a $250 000 car ? For that price I would get myself a Brabus Rocket 800.
Дверь закрылась со звуком как на УАЗике.
Cheaper than a model 3 in 5 years....
After all this Phantom will top the chart anyway.
Looks like the Mazda 6 on meth.
Looks cheap.
Hey Doug, just a suggestion. Please get a pov review of you driving the car rather than just the face angle. Thank you.
The interior looks like wingtip Oxford shoes modeled after Derek Jeters baseball glove.
Nice car for 250k
No cooled seats. You're spending $1 million yes you can design bespoke parts for 100 cars.   That's an expensive polished shit. With Ford turn signals.
I wonder what it would cost to have a hand stitched roof installed on my Mini Countryman JCW.  Of course, with a panaoramic roof, I guess it would require less leather than this Taraf! I suspect at worst, the costs would go up to $8K for this nice upgrade.
Noticed stitches going loose on passenger front side! Im curious how much they paid you so you made a video for such terrible car!
Bruh. My Honda Accord has a Garmin system
What a beautiful million dollar sedan that seats only 4 and has no moon/sunroof, let alone panoramic sunroof. Cool.
What a junk car for a million dollars! I wouldn’t even buy for 50k
Doug, stop putting the conversion from lbs to kg.  We're selfish Americans and we don't care about the metric system.
For a million I thought it had bulletproof protection or something
Idk exactly why but from the outside all I see is a chevrolet impala with a nice paint job and some "ok" tail lights
Gotta admit the Vanquish looks a lot better
million bucks and no sunroof?
That paint does a massive disservice to the appearance of this car.
I'd choose the lc500 over this
It kinda looks like a Tesla. But not in a good way. Maybe it's the color. The grill looks like a Mazda.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder of course, but to me, this is not that attractive. The huge C-pillar and the short, rear overhang makes it look funny. Anyhoo, this thing is ridiculously over-priced and pity the poor fool who buys one. Even if I had the money to spend on such a vehicle, it would never happen.
He's on the rooftop of The Peterson Museum at Wilshire Blvd and LA Brea...
I'm sorry mr doug it looks like a stretched Honda accord. If it's so luxurious why does it have a cheap manual key entry.
I've always loved this car, one of the best looking 4 door sedans,  but a million dollars?! It should be priced no more than three hundred thousand dollars! And they didn't even bother to install a panoramic sunroof! To state the obvious, the price is just ridiculous!! A Rolls Royce is a million times a better car!! Hell even an S class is probably better!!!
This car has some weird clumsy features... like the way the TVs are mounted, the rear center console that folds up for no reason despite the lack of a middle seat... it just folds up and there’s nothing under it lol. The steering wheel is terrible considering the car, interior is kinda basic/iPhone-ish. It just doesn’t look all that special. Rolls Royce beats this car all day.
Doug is the type of guy who is the.0000001% of the world that uses MySpace.
If this were a Maserati, the Doug Score would have been zero.
I’m sorry I don’t care what Doug says, this car is so ugly!!
Please do the 202 Hyundai Kona!
Change the playback speed to 0.25 and listen to the "thhhhhissss"
I would take the S class over this anyday.. Its not even half as luxurious as the S class yet it costs 10X more.
My Fisker Karma looks waaaaaaaaaay better. Just saying.
So we aren't going to talk about that Centenario Roadster?
Not impressed
value should be -5
My 2016 Honda Civic has a better infotainment system than this
That steering wheel is horrible, the infotainment system is a joke, the exterior isn’t “distinct” or cool at all, the interior literally looks like any other luxury sedan with nothing special or anything to separate itself. This is the ugliest piece of shit I’ve ever seen. I would spend 1 million just to take this car out into the desert and blow it up with a javelin rocket launcher. Aston Martin made this to scam people who have too much oil money LMFAO. Respect.
If they thru a ford Taurus badge on this not sure many know the diff
Am I the only one who thinks this has the side profile of a four-door Challenger (if such a thing existed), and the front end of an Accord?
Mercedes 300 w123 is most beautiful car
I think its overpriced b/c there's no sun roof and I will take my business elsewhere
Member when you got a V8 that produced a lousy 150hp for 10 grand? Now you pay 50 grand for anything with a v8 but at least you get 400hp+
I'd be very pissed if my 1 million dollar car looked like a Chrysler 300 from the rear.
That thing is absolute theft, imagine paying a milli for a Lincoln continental with a different badge. Could get a Bentley for a quarter of the price and it would be multitudes better.
Stunning. Simply stunning.
Aston Martins are luxurious Aston Martin: Hold my hand crafted body panels Introduces Lagonda*
Anyone else can’t believe it’s a 2016?
Imagine spending 1 million dollars on a luxury sedan that doesn’t even have a sunroof
It's hideous....
The front looks like a like a "troll meme" line drawing.
Plss tell me a centenario review is coming pls saaayy iiiittt
I see a little bit of arteon in the front
Doug is drunk if he thinks this car is beautiful, i love aston's & i love big 4 doors but this aint it
Other car companies: we have a luxury car brand. let's give them their own logo.   Aston Martin: no let's just change the letters.    That car might be "luxurious" Not worth anywhere near a $1,000,000
Does anyone else think the front looks like a Honda Accord?
Holy shit, that looks insaneeeeeeer
This is a true waste of money this car sucks with options
"built for a specific market" = built for rich oil sheikhs
very disappointing. by the way, any mercedes or bmw look better than that. just because it looks odd and kinda cool does not make it the best looking sedan.
While the front end speaks to Aston Martin’s muscle car origins, I think the rear end is lacking. It’s rear reminds me of a camaro for some reason, maybe it’s the boxiness of it. Overall it’s an attractive car, but that rear end takes away from its looks and proportions of the whole car that could have made it a 10/10.
I'm sorry but if I had a million dollars I wouldn't spend it on this ugly thing. Who paid you to say that "this is the  best looking 4 door car ever" anyways?!? 😃
More beautiful than the E38? thumbs down.
Lagonda is Portuguese for "Fancy Ford Fusion"
Save $975,000.00 and get a nice used A7.
One of the most stupid cars I've ever seen.
Doug you are hilariously funny 😆
Flying spur blows this out of the water
Its so pretty in matt black 😍😌😍😌😍😌
Nice car for 75.000€
For me, it's Just a waay  overpriced toy that you can buy instead of a house or a vintage classic car
Million dollars and the trunk doesn't auto close?
How is this in any way worth a million dollars. Literally has less than half the features of a rolls Royce. This car is basically a fully trimmed bmw aplina b7. Disgusting how overpriced this car is.
You don't put stuff in the trunk, you don't fill up with gas your servant does
How the f*** did YouTube show me 5 ads before I hit the 3 min mark of this video.
Personally, I believe both the Tesla S and the Fisker Karma are both more beautiful sedans than this car is based on exterior appearance alone, even with their outdated designs.
Doug generally I like your reviews but I am sorry to say that in this one I am disappointment. You simply did not justify the price of this car!
What a terrible car! What happen Doug? You should be making fun about the carry over Ford parts in this baby diarrea interior....

That car looks VERY long.
This car is not worth $1,000,000.00
i mean i watch carwow for just short and fun reviews and doug demuro for detailed and "boring" reviews
This just proves to me that people just like cars because they are expensive because it genuinely looks like a 20k used 2004 Aston it actually look disgusting even the interior looks so average...
Black paint, with orange/brown interior? Wtf
I... I can't unsee the Honda Accord face on it. Slap an "H" on the hood and tell me you can't see it.
Imagine spending a million dollars on a long Fusion lmao
0:37 yep the lamborghini centenario vid is coming up soon
No one: Absolutely nobody: Doug:THIS!!!!
Junk!
Breakdown of this car’s price: - $200,000 car - $800,000 for Taraf name
It was made for people with empty heads and full pockets
“Taraf” in Arabic means luxury , it’s really cool they used such a word ( in Arabic slang it means overpriced unnecessary luxury )
It is literally a parts car. I personally think the Rapide looks better too. Like Doug said, you are literally paying to be the only guy driving around with one at all times and that's it.
This car needs a pet panther seat more than it needs a child seat
Omg just give me this car !! I won’t drive it! I will sell it and start a new freaking life!
Really Doug? Very very very paid.
"This will always be owned by someone with exquisite taste"  No.  Being rich and buying expensive things is NOT correlated with having good taste.  Having to pose to your rich friends and be *seen* to be rich is a *far* more likely reason to have this car.  Or being a collector - which is an economic decision at least as much as an aesthetic one.
anyone else notice he's on the roof of the Petersen museum?
Waste of money only
My Acura has nicer tach than that car for million plain analog
$950k to much!
A million dollars and you still have to pay someone to have a custom sun roof put in!
What is that metallic clunk that keeps happening when he turns?
Wow a million dollar car and it does not even have skylights... I prefer a rolls for almost half the price of that
Sometimes i just love the word. DEPRECIATION
What about the paint? I don’t think Doug mentioned it. It doesn’t look right on an luxury car. On any car in my opinion.  For many reasons I think Doug got this review all wrong. It’s not really beautiful or luxurious for an ultimate luxury sedan. I think Doug maybe juggling too many balls these days.
a rapide used is 70k,  the same car with different body and logo sells for 1 mil??????
Not sure if this was said before, but that car is the only sedan in the world made out of carbon fiber. Still overpriced imo, but I think Doug might've missed this piece of information.
You cant compare the best looking car (e38) with this shit wtf
Front looks like a VW Arteon 😂😂
Why the fuck it looks like a Rolls Royce it makes me cringe
i actually think the 2009 mercedes cls looks 10 times better lol
I will never understand why people with money buy expensive cars. You could get a cooler cheap car and build it. A 700hp shitbox would be more fun than a super car.
Amazing there are only two on the whole continent One in LA and the other in Mexico City
The headlights from the side look like the newest Honda acord
1 million and you have to attach your ipad, really? wtfff
That's a horrible horrible name....
1m ... Seriously!!! Aston Martins biggest scam
I’m selling my 2003 Sebring, asking price $2million. Come review that, it’s the worlds most expensive sedan.
Mazda 3 has a better interior than that ....
I still prefer the flying spur. 😊
Glorified Honda Accord
It’s ok Doug don’t worry you can still edit out the part where you said this car is more beautiful than the 7 series. I won’t tell anyone
1$ million for what ?!
Styling - 10/10.. I think its kindda overrated!
All this explains about $100k. So where is the other $900k?
Looks more like a Ford Fusion + Chevy Impala bastard that got abandoned and adopted by some rich oil baron and painted up to be "one-of-a-kind". Not worth $1M, hell with infinite money I'd not even pay $500k for it. I feel like the 2013 Hyundai Equus at least TRIED HARDER.
How many times did Doug say Lagonda?
Aston Martin has become a joke. It’s sad...
Imagine a car collector still has it or ur dad secretly kept it
Have you seen interior of new Audi A8? And it cost 10 times less.
👍🏻
Douglas, come on...the best looking 4 door car you’ve ever seen? That has to be a joke right? Were you paid to say that? This thing looks like an overweight shark with multiple sclerosis.
Not impressed at all...
I reckon the cheapest optional extra for this car is the iPads 😂😂
I wonder what he would say if this was a Lexus.
Looks like a Ford Fusion
Take a shot every time he says "distinctive"
For $125-150,000 this would be pretty neat, for a million and up this is pretty nah.
There is no way this thing cost 1m....its not even close to a phantom
I think it is reduntant to say this is the most expensive LUXURY sedan. I mean isn't it obvious that the most expensive sedan in the world is also luxurious?
The Phantom did it better in every way for half the price  And the Dougscore was very biased
S class is far better then this over priced ordinary car..
Hi Doug, Your videos are not showing up in my recommendations. YT algo maybe playing games with your channel. Do check.
The exterior is really striking. It has that long, lean look. Very sexy. The interior, on the other hand, just looks dated, tacky, and hobbled together. I expect better for a $1mil car.
I wonder why the Monte Carlo bar is painted white
" it looks very different from just about anything else"   Unless you're parked beside a ford taurus, or a dodge charger
Worlds *ugliest
The most expensive luxury car in the world : Styled like a Dodge Charger..
2018 cars were built as Aston Martin just wanted to use left over parts to bring in cash. Example of not having certain parts available the iPads are actually refurbished units as you couldn't buy them new in 2018.
ALPINA B3 F30/F31 PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!
looks like a matte black Accord
Just like all modern Astons: ugly, overpriced and made of pieces used in other cars...
TSLA
The colour of that interior is horrendous
not a million dollar car to my eyes... good looking yes.. luxury.. yes.. but for a million? Nahhhhh!!! and i dont care how rare it is if it doesnt have those little things that make it extra!!
how does delivery work on carsandbids.com? do I have to figure that out myself?
Those plastic stalks are inexcusable. Just machine some from aluminum ffs it's a million dollar car.
Who noticed the same wheels like dodge Challenger/Charger?
Such cars should offer updated systems for entertainment and what not.. everytime something new comes out.. they get it implemented in the car!!
lol the front of this car looks like a honda accord
Maybe you just show what the car is made of than were they wanted to sell it.
for half the price rolls royce not only does better.....they blow this out of the water.
yeeeaaah, he was def paid for this he buttering up this british car
Just get an S65 amg and save $750k
太丑了。工业垃圾
Slap a fancy name on anything and you can sell anything at any price to Arabs. It’s amazing how much money they’ll spend on garbage like this that’s way too overpriced.
10:02 I think the door has other feelings about that statement
Absolutely awesome. Who cares how expensive it is. I couldn’t afford it even if it was 5k. Love that Aston had the balls to make it, and in such small numbers.
Taraf in Arabic means luxury or a lavish expensive lifestyle
Am I the only one that looked at the thumbnail and saw a Kia with a beauty filter?
I'm really not feeling this car honestly. To me the exterior styling looks like some weird mix of Aston, Dodge, and Maserati and ultimately doesn't look like anything, not to mention the bizarrely shaped greenhouse. And the interior looks like every other luxury car out there; definitely taking the piss with $1mil price tag
Over priced.
Luxury is always the biggest rip-off, especially as time goes on and feature pass down to us. not at all mad at this car just my own slice. I prefer something OffRoad looking, water proof, something maybe with removable doors or rugged looking, like it can take the dirt. So, I am biased. It's really funny to me seeing luxury things, especially SUVs, like what's the point
Looks like a concept Ford Taurus. Has Ford Focus turn signals stocks. Everything Doug has said to be ``a show of luxury and exquisite taste`` can be found in a Audi A8 or BMW 7 Series...Don`t know how someone could actually buy this and enjoy it. Changing a badge isn`t that hard.
It looks like a tesla
Aston Martin business candidate: Let's just replace the logo, cover the car in leather while keeping everything else as outdated as possible and charge 1M for this. Aston Martin CEO: You're hired.
A $1 million car… And half the world is eating out of dumpsters.
Possibly the most annoying guy on the Internet,… But I can’t stop watching.
I’m not an ostentatious mega sedan kinda guy and it doesn’t remotely seem like a good buy but it’s visually striking
Shame austin martin sucks
It is by far the shitties and ugliest car i have ever seen. I hope i have 120 mil to spend so i can buy every peace of it and destroy it . It looks like chinese copy of europian luxurios sedan.
He doesn’t even believe his bullshit. Should have had a George Carlin type comedian do this review
The amount of times hes said the logo is not the aston martin logo but instead its the lagonda logo can buy me a aston martin lagonda
To me it looks like it’s from 2009
How in the world is this car a million dollars?  And why is Doug hyping it up so much..?
Finally a car where Doug can do his auto mansplaining in the back!
I would still prefer rr phantom 8 over this .nothing special in it which is worth a million bucks
If only Aston sorted out this Infotainment issue...it would be such a major step up...
New Aston Martin models are not true Aston Martin
Doug: "This is the most unique and beautiful sedan ever" The car: *looks exactly like a Dodge Charger in profile, has a Honda Accord grill*
Regardless if it's overpriced, it's absolutely beautiful. I wouldn't buy it, even if I had the money to blow, but damn that's a gorgeous vehicle.
The front kinda looks like an i8 to me 😂😂
The car is very ugly
Million dollars? I woundn't even pay 100k for this box.  My car has better everything in front seats and everything leather and still costs 20 times less  No wonder British cars Sucks!
10:49 "There is a lot of space back here" he says while being squeezed in the backseat. This is an awful video, if this was any other car at half the (or even a third of the price) he would rip it to pieces
Even the entry level BMWs or Range Rovers will be much better than this. Interior is so average looking like normal cars.
I wonder why it’s not sold yet... #meh
Pff shitbox
Another Aston Martin in wich you can but your all family
Doug is the type of guy to invite himself to his birthday party and not show up
I think you're not impressed for the car but it's price
i watched the videos,thinking that from some angle this would look like a million dollar car,or he might show some jaw dropping features,not just waste of money but waste of time too.
Only if few will notice that he intentionally mentioned ford Taurus in this video
9:57 my guy literally my dad's SUV can do the same thing with the doors too, it definitely looks like you got paid a lot for this video.
this is a car from GTA V..
Did they rip the back off a challenger?
This is the oddest review, his ability to justify the cheaping out on certain things is wild. I’m surprised he didn’t spin the Ford turn signal stock as a smart economizing measure.
Word
This is like that iPhone app that cost $1,000 and did nothing but display a screen that said you paid $1,000 for an app that does nothing.
If it had an infotainment system and a good gauge cluster people would maybe pay one fifth of that price
10:04... Between "exactly" and "there", the door didn't hold for him🙄😂😂😂😂
Worst money ever spent . That car is ugly Doug.  Let’s be honest.
As Doug said "This car is designed for Arabs!" well Aston Martin has taken Arabs for a complete Fool. PERIOD
Doug is the type of guy that calls himself The Dwag...
This car and this video is a scam, Doug despite your clear effort to promote your own business I thought regarding cars you would try to keep it authentic but I was clearly wrong. I guess in the end money always comes first, pity.
I can't see how this is worth more than $150k brand new
I know that this is going to make me look old/old fashioned. And there is a good reason for that - I am. But it beats the hell of me that you would take a nice looking and expensive car, and spend yet more money on it to make it look like it has never been polished? It to me only supports the old maxim that 'You cannot buy good taste'...LOL
"If you want to sell your car, Cars and Bids will get you the most money. If you want to buy a car, you can ... uh...  do that too."
It looks like a hybrid between a Honda Accord and Lincoln Continental
Leganda foreva
Aston Martin: iPad not included  Me: Eh, the car is still awesome!  Kids: THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS AND THIS CAR IS TERRIBLE!!!
love your review but the car is not worth half of what it cost.  How do you sell a car made for the desert but do not offer vented/cooled seats.  How do you share parts with any car when you paid 1Mill.?
Gamin entertaintment system. LOLLLL this guy's still tried to defend Ashton Marton for using it ! using soft-glove
Who would paint a car like that in some shitty wrap looking matte black tho
waste of money
vented rear seats?
There's no way this car is worth a million. No way in any universe. The middle east got duped. My lincoln MKT has more tech in it than this car, and I got it for $13k
design looks like a dacia 1310 or 1300, the door frame and format
I can’t wait until Scotty Kilmer overtakes you
Reminds me a lot on Alfa Romeo 159
This thing honestly looks pretty much identical to the rapids inside and it honestly doesn't look that great outside
This car is pretty good. If it was like $150k
'La Gone Daa' not 'La gun Da'
Saddest part is come this time tomorrow I will have forgotten about this car because yeah it's pretty and rare and what not, but it doesn't have that thing that makes it imprinted in your mind.
Is this a joke? I'm sorry Doug but this just seems like a bullshit biased overview. We know this car is barely worth 150k and is simply just a statement car for the ultra rich. Good for Aston Martin though becuase that kind of insane profit margin deserves some praise.
I'm the kind of person who turns his head at anything even slightly interesting I see out on the road, and I'm not sure even this would turn my head. It may have smooth lines but beautiful? 10/10? I'm sorry Doug, but this is one of the few times I disagree with you and I heartily disagree. This car has zero selling points.
This is definitely *not* a bang for your buck
14:12 Not even Lagonda-pad?? Fuck this car dude!
If I had a million dollars Id just buy the RR Phantom
Doug the type of guy to review a boiled egg when running out of ideas!
Looks like a Masarati but you could probably get one or two more of those
All rappers need this
I dont think matte black is the way to go with this car. Other than that incredible looking.
Looks like a ford Mondeo
Dough, are you serious ? This car isn't half way close to RR phantom in terms of looks and luxury... But strangely it costs twice as much as Phantom.
I WOULD CRY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE TO OWN THE BEAUTIFUL SUPER CARS YOU FILMED PREVIOUSLY DOUG.
The rims and paint job (or is it a wrap?) and even brake discs and red calipers are total cheeseball. And Aston Martin just cannot do interiors. The whole car is an embarrassment even more so at that price.
I wouldn't pay more than 15.5...
Looks like a Ford Fusion front and Chrysler 200 rear were welded together at a Hyundai Factory
Jebus chrystler, this looks like Gemballa and Mansory took the wheel....
So why the ROLLS ROYCE  is still  the most luxury car??  Who agrees that the ROLLS ROYCE is the best?
I don't like the look of this car
If this is worth $1 million dollars, it's extremely underwhelming. The Volvo S90 is better.
You spend that much on a car you would expect electric window blinds for the passengers and a vanity mirror, imo not worth the money , stick with the RR Phantom.
Apparently, this guy cannot speak in normal way, disgusting way of describing
Me : That C-pillar is the ugliest thing i've seen on a Luxury car. Wait.... It's the Key hole. No...it's that ugly drinks cooler. No...it's the iPad holders. No...it's the ugly AC vents. No...it's the gauge cluster. No...it's the ford turn signal. No...it's the steering wheel. No...it's the tiny Navigation screen. No...it's the cheap plastic buttons.  The only thing that was nice to see was that beautiful V12.
Really a 10? the most beautiful sedan ever? if it weren't a 1 million dollar Aston martin, you'd think it was a cheap Chinese rip off of a Bentley or Rolls Royce.
Hi Doug, first of all, thanks for this video. The Lagonda Taraf is beautiful but for me, the most beautiful luxury sedan is the A.M. Rapide...
Stop point at the things and parts, we are not fools, we know where is door handles and what is windows are. And we want to see a car, not your hand. F*king annoying sh!t.
I am a huge Aston Martin fan but this car is hideous!
Such a crappy car, it should cost around $180k max.  Imagine how much crap you can buy for 1m instead of this.
Most beautiful sedan ever? I mean taste is subjective and aston martins are generally very beautiful. But I really can't see how this is the most beautiful sedan ever.
2 phantom 's worth of luxury sedan?  Nope. Just overpriced piece of shit.
shabby dressed Doug next to the most expensive production saloon car, not impressive ... you could have at least donned a suit for just this one Doug!, you let everybody down.
To be honest, I don't get all the excitement Doug has about this car. Although the interior is good looking to a certain extent, the exterior styling has absolutely nothing special for me. It looks like a glorified Ford Fusion. Even the wheels look like cheap aftermarkets you'd put on an altima. I don't have a million dollars to spare on a sedan but if i did, I'd probably get myself a Phantom, an amg gt sedan AND an M8 grand coupe for less than what this one costs.
I’m sorry but this car is not better or more luxurious than a Rolls Royce, Maybach or even an S-class. It is disappointing !
Doug... this car is ugly...
https://youtu.be/Iu35f7F55Lg
Videos and pictures don't do this car any justice. SERIOUSLY! I saw this car in person, up close, doors open interior view, and at the time I thought it was the HOTTEST car I have seen in my life. I couldn't stop talking about it. I'm a car guy... Own a Porsche, been in Rolls, AMG, Bentley... This car made them look like Hondas. The detail was crazy. Maybe because it is unique and rare, but the styling seen in person is absolutely amazing.
I don't think I would pay 1mil for a car in primer and a Garmin  GPS!
It doesn’t have factory rear screen???? Not buying...
Looks like a Honda Accord front end
Ya, expensive cars are a joke. It's not even the car, it's the person. You can have a pink car, that's comfy and works well, but people will care more about you than the car. The boomers and previous generation buying into deceptive loans and cars, continuing into today with people who buy expensive branding is only going to lead to waste and over-expense.. Even cars that most older guys seem to think 'make you jealous' like the tinged low sport cars tend to be cringey. Many guys buy those cars after being tricked thinking 'wow, what a sport car, it's my dream', but you honestly look cringey and dumb inside of it and it also tends to look out of place in normal driving. What you typically want is a good deal on a used or cheap car that's like-new, you can find sometimes convertibles and custom work if you want, and/or look for good MPG on any car that gives you luxury or storage if that's your intent. If you want more MPG and storage room, or specific use cases, there's cars for that. You can literally devise cheap solutions that save you 'thousands' because that's how much hype is in the industry. If you know what you're doing and you want things like TVs on the back of the car, like if you really wanted that, you can probably hook it all up for like 20$ + the cost of each TV screen, it'd probably add up to be <100$ for cheaply hooking up 2 small screens to a DVD player or like some satellite TV that would be good for a car for example; and generally you'd only want one screen, plus no one wants tiny screens so they're cheap. You can hook 'into' the electrical system on any part, 'or' even easier convert the existing cigar/power port and plug in an adapter that can easily handle the screen and video input device, just make sure your battery has good amp and capacity and such; and consider overall greenness and power-draw of everything you use to ensure years of usage; if you even keep it all plugged in all the time. Luxury is only a brand. I can't imagine spending anything over 10k on a car really, unless you're just rich, and want to waste. You can even emulate some things like the coating and color of the car, and sometimes a few customizations or rarities that make a difference between a cheap car and a car that looks and runs good. They price like 10$ solutions at like 1000$+ it's ridiculous crap. What is the outside of this car, black plastic? Looks ok but it's not really my idea of cool.
So you basically pay 1 million dollars for half cooked ricer doors
4:30  (If y gave an million dollars) what  if I have that 😐
Not worth 1 mil at all. Period
Please review the Lamborghini centenario
6:17 The grill is basically the Aston Martin grill flipped upside down and stretched a bit more across the dront.
THE TARAF'S BODY IS 100% CARBON FIBER. DOUG FAILED TO MENTION THIS SIGNIFICANT FEATURE!!  Rollers, Bentleys, and others cannot say the same thing.  This feature by itself distinguishes it from Rollers and Bentleys. [IMO, the Bentley Flying Spur has a more luxurious and attractive interior than a Roller.]
There are so many other luxury/hypercars I would much rather have. The interior of this car and exterior omg just wtf
I don't know man but I think a Rolls Royce or S Class is much better 😅😅
Dull
The 2 o'clock and 10 o'clock shots of the exterior give it a last run Ford Taurus look to me. Sedans that look better than this? Genesis G80 or 90, Volvo S90, , S Class, 8 Series, Bentley, Rolls...Maybe it truly must be seen in person?
https://youtu.be/nSvl2XmuoKQ
Overpriced. RR and Bentley are better
Yeah, nothing says luxury like a taillight that switches from red to orange . . .
Reminder : for cost of this abomination you can have Rolls-Royce,Bentley and change still will be enough to buy german supersedan
The gauge cluster and center controls look like they are from a 2009 Mercedes c class. Which you can buy for about 15k.....
RWD?
tarting to think Doug is payed by the companies, because this isn’t even CLOSE to as luxurious as a Rolls, Maybach and even a Bentley, and we all know Doug knows enough about luxury cars to say that this thing is a complete scam for what it is. btw how comes no one is talking about how every influencer is using northfy to grow on yt and ig
Cant really criticize this as nobody will be buying this after looking at the price tag itself
Looks like a typical $125k luxury sedan.  Seems like Aston was trying to dupe some Saudi princes into buying $100k car for $1M because it's rare.
This had to drop under 100k in a couple more years.  Like this brand, jaguars, Range, they lose value faster than crypto.
8:45 Million dollar car makes man get down on knees. Elegance
I already looks outdated !
it is nice looking whip for sure
Front just looks like a Honda Accord.
Looks like a Whale Shark.
Doug is a sweaty bastard!
The Lagonda still looks like an anteater if u ask me 😂
If that's OGara Coach, what's OGara 1st Class like?
YOU REVIEWED A CENTENARIO!!!!?????
Looks a lil bit like my dream car
The ugliest Aston Martin ever and probably the ugliest looking sedan that costs a million dollars
😂 I believe those 120 rich people are waiting for your score to buy this  future buyers🙏
Hey Doug, that pattern on the seats is called Brogue stitching or broguing.
The front looks either like a Honda CRZ or Toyota Prius 😐
No sunroof ....I’ll pass

It looks like a Ford Taurus and a Lamborghini Estoque
That’s one nice Genesis🥴
“....which is a touch I’d expect, when you’re paying a million dollars for a car”
Sweptail costs more
Never realized how much the front end resembles the current Honda Accord until seeing this.
Fun fact: Someone at Aston Martin made a typo with the price and added an extra 0 but it was too late to correct it.
or , you could buy an audi / bmw .
This thing looks like it's worth 150k at most......
It looks a lot better in the flesh than a computer 3d render.
I would rather have a rolls Royce phantom
Butchered the pronunciation of O'Gara
I’ve seen Lowriders, donks & muscle cars cleaner than this .
Small ass screen
They had to make a limited run because this car would depreciate so fast it'll give you whiplash
Bananas car. One note: I'm pretty sure those struts that keep the rear doors (and other panels) positioned are gas/pneumatic, not hydraulic:)
ridiculous
“A fool and his money soon part(y)”.
How much did they pay you to hype this car up?
Doing the grille comparison was COMPLETELY IDIOTIC. Why on Earth would you compare a pre refresh Aston to a new one? All new Astons have that same style of grille and you've done reviews of new Astons covering the grille so why? That was EXTREMELY stupid but being a Doug Demuro there has to be AT LEAST one dumbass thing said...
Looks like one of the Alfa Romeo's cars
Doug couldn't look into the camera because he was forced to speak good of the car. That shiit isn't worth 35k...I can get those interiors and better informatic systems in a Honda Accord.
If I saw that garbage I would honestly think it was a Chinese knockoff.
The best looking four door car I've ever seen. You're not wrong man
Oh cmon, "Russian Certification" logo on an 1m$ Aston Martin key.... 17:28
Kind look like an impala
Doug is always proud of cars and bids
30 minute infomercial for a car no one wants to buy.
„The most beautiful sedan in the world” well, I don’t see Giulia Quadrifoglio here
That thing is absolute garbage, they made a 90,000 dollar car one million.
Why is this one million dollars, most of the seats in the back and their options look like they were copied from rolls Royce.
My LC500's interior is just as nice if not nicer than this $1 million car.  Frankly, I don't find the styling beautiful at all.
This looks like a fusion of a Porsche ford fusion and a dodge challenger
Drinking game: Drink every time 'Laganda', 'Taraf' or 'Laganda Taraf' is mentioned.
What a nice million dollar Volvo...
My man the word taraf means Heritage
What a bunch of whinging jerks
This has got to be one of the ugliest cars I have ever seen! I’m sure production numbers were low because nobody wanted it not from Aston Martin standards in rarity!
lol steering wheel looks very cheap and the infotainment hahaha
I just realized all the "Doug is the type of guy" comments are gone, what happened?
For a million dollars I would expect leather in the trunk with no exposed bolts
Doug is the type of guy for lick his fingers to flip a page on an Ipad
What’s the max price you would pay fir that car?
It looks like an $80k Ford Focus, but it’s a mil. I guess the video is doing it’s appearance great injustice.
This car is from an era where sports- car- makers wanted to get on the bandwagon of the Mercedes CLS, like the Porsche panamera or Maserati Quattroporte. Thankfully Aston Martins todays piece for the SUV- bandwagon is bit more affordable :)
"It's bland" - Gordon Ramsey
The exterior is magnificent. The interior is a big disappointment... Cheap, reused parts... (Look the original, 'revolutionally' dashboard)
My only concern is it's not April 1st
Nothing about this car is new, it all simple gadgets. So stupid, such a waste of money.
RR Bentley and s class are so much better than this
A nice reflective silver or white fits this car way better than the 2018 gangster- flat- black...
You know you're at the top when Aston Martin is not considered an exclusive brand
He definitely got paid by Aston Martin. No one wants this piece of shit. You can get a Bentley a Rolls Royce no one in their right mind would spend 1m on this.
This is not a million dollar vehicle.
Expensive for looking like a Hyundai
15:24-15:26  hahaha i see what you did there
Created soley to milk some pocket change from Middle-Eastern oil Sheks.  Fair enough.  Cheaply developed from a standard platform so high margin.  Well played Aston Martin.  Looks nice...but the proportions are just......'off' somewhere...rear doors?... mmmm.
A car that is targeted for the middle east weather and yet it has heated  back seats and NO cooled seats
Doesn't look like 1mil, definitely something only the middle eastern princes and oil sheikh would buy
no special material, no exclusive lagonda parts, below than average technology, average engine power for an ultra luxury car, but yet it costs two phantoms?! oh yes thats right, its the market that it targets, they just know how ridiculously middle eastern billionaires spend their money without thinking, and thats how they sold it. It just disgusts me as an arab or as any human for this matter!!!
Neato!
I think you were way too gentle with this car, so lackluster for the enermous price tag.
When i first saw the picture of the video i thought that its a Dodge
It's pronounced ta - raf not te -raf  which is used to describe the life of people who are soo rich that they don't care about anything anymore and have evry thing they want .  Also it looks great but 1 Million dollars is too much .
Can you please review that Saab 900 Turbo that's on your website
stfu doug
The is the biggest waste of money  at that time and till now
Look at those air vents, those stocks on the wheel, the sat nav, Rolls Royce and Bentley cost waaaaaay less and they're dripping luxury
I will buy a rolls royce phantom 2020 cheaper and way better
seems like trying too hard... and all the so-called features are available in most luxury sedans anyway. This is really a big waste of money and Lagonda seems like trying to hard to impress.
I love the exterior styling, but that leather is going to melt our skin to it in the heat (and she's going to hold a lot of heat with that black exterior - which I thought was really odd for a car designed to be sold to the UAE et al), but even with the exclusivity factor, even a Zonda interior has fancier billeted aluminium indicator stalk, and this has one from a Ford Focus?  I might look forward to next year's model, thanks.
I bet the millionaires would even buy a yaris with some leather rebadged with a supercar logo just to stand out and show off. Edit: minor spelling mistake.
and now you can pull up to a stoplight with the first ever 10/10 styling dougscore car for 1 million bucks
If this was designed to be sold in the middle east market for a million dollors, shouldn't it have cooled seats at the back? Or both?
A Suzuki Swift has got better Infotainment than this !!!!!
You look like Steve jobs & talk like him too
Doug you look so weird talking beside the car on your knees. Either you are ridiculously tall or the Taraf is awfully low.
Looks like a Ford Fusion mixed with a dodge challenger
👇This is how many times Doug told "Million".
Waited until the interior shots before commenting! - 1 million is a ridiculous amount for this!
Matte Black is the last colour of a car before the junkyard
I'd rather have the old one. Thumbs down for the car (not the video)
Am not seeing the 1M with this one ...
Sorry doug..but No car can beat the looks of panamera !!
This car is not worth 1.000.000.Is far away from s-classe. S-classe, mercedes maybach ie the best !
it looks like a null car in Forza horizon 4
I thought Aston Martin was Aston Martin’s luxury brand. This is still a disgustingly ugly car. I wish I was rich enough to sneer at the cars price tag. 😏
Jesus christ my 2009 BMW has a better infotainment system than this shit.
Didn't even know this thing existed.
https://youtu.be/7NujuC6QGV4
Funny that Doug didn't roast the million dollar car having the ugly keyhole in the door just like in 1980's Ford Escort
It's hidious. Over priced and under powered for the price.we have moved into the ridiculous.
Really love this beautiful car
How would anybody say this thing a pretty and luxury its a piece of shit with expensive price. Who needs handles to come out of the car anyway and centre console is the ugliest in the expensive carsthey add leather to roof but no sunroof???
I have been enjoying my 1966 Imperial (metallic black with silver-blue leather interior, all options) for 50 years, power, comfort, superb handling and reliability in a beautiful design has provided a million dollars of memories in 322,000 miles, still shows near new, and confident it could turn a Taraf into a ball of tin foil, and still drive away looking good.
Nice Crisis Car ................
So I could get a Cullinan and Wraith (if I were wealthy), or this. Not impressed with this at all.
tourath means heritage in arabic . it has nothing to do with luxury. :) just saying buddy. love your videos. love the Andddd you use soo often .
Imagine how he would have roasted this thing to infinity if it was a maserati
Lagonda . You're wondering what it is.. It's Aston Martin Luxury brand. Wait what? lolol I thought Aston Martin was luxury 🤣
lol when he mentioned *old maserati* I thought he was about to bash the 2015 Ghibli model again
Front looks like a refined ford fusion, meanwhile  rapides are selling for 50k usd with genuine aston style, they likely use the same chassis too.
I just can one thing for sure , its the ugliest car i've ever seen
Two Rolls Royce is a better option than buying this bucket size sedan.
It's made to look like it has suicide doors. Naf! And looks like Kia made the body panels. I agree, waste of time.
it's..... ugly..... yo
The truly outstanding thing about this Million dollar car is that it costs a million dollar..!
Hide the crappiness! LOL! 👌 Is that even a word. Now it is!
Really don't like how Dougie keeps saying how beautiful it is, that we wont ever see a more beautiful luxury sedan. All he did was say the same shit over and over, trying to convince us that it's not shit.
An advertisement for very very long piece of luxury shit
The windows roll up in to the body, not just for rain but mostly for aerodynamics and to keep wind noise to a minimum.  Also the adjustable door is actually a Porsche invention.
if you try to make Ford Fusion look like beyonce, this will be the result
So much luxury and no sunroof!! 😕
Love Doug but somehow he's not being himself here. Something seems off
still rolls royce is better than this
You own a million dollar car and need to get outta door a slit-width open... Worrying abt scrapping your doors..
Taraf mean heritage , i love you vid from ksa
What about a Maibach?  No you're right even fully customized I don't think they are over a million dollars.
18:11 directly stolen from Audi😂...for 1.200.000 Dollars I expect something more special...
crap just waste of money RR is the best 👌
Dougs a dingle
It probably sounds crazy, but from the side it reminds me of a Cadillac with a hint of  Lincoln.
So much leather...it must smell good inside there😂
"I LOVE HOW ONE HALF OF THE TAIL LIGHTS TURN ORANGE WHEN YOU SIGNAL!"  Come on now doug, this was a bit of a stretch. I'm not even going to comment on how horribly overpriced this car is compared to a Royce, but ..... COME ON!
I’d much much rather have 2 Rollers who’s with me. Even one seems more luxurious than this.
This guy's needs knees must be shot to hell.
Why would you make a custom ash tray but buy a fucking turn signal, which you normally use more often, from Ford? This car as a whole doesn't make any sense and is heavily overpriced in every sense. I can really feel the whackiness of the car in every little detail. I think it's quite outrageous and signals that Aston Martin is a actual shit show.
no sun roof for a that money?
Close your eyes. Cannot unhear Chandler
Its loud over them speed bumps and rattles
No one would buy that, maybe for $50,000.
STYLING 10??? ARE YOU DRUNK. I prefer the Jaguar XJ50's design over that piece of shit
I have million dollar.
How many time did you say taraf?
I am having that car in my dream 😍 #motivation2rule
Ok leather roof = echo. Smh 🤦
Can someone tell it’s differences (in appearance) from a Ford Fusion
This car is way over rated🕵👷🙀🙊🙅🤦🤣😂
it looks like a 40k car...
Is it just me or does the back look oddly cramped, especially for such a large car?
Meh, I still don’t get how other cars guys loose their breath when they look at Aston Martin’s. This one is missing some polygons as the body meets the back. I saw many driving their Astons the other day in Malibu, then I flipped when I saw a 1994 Corvette ZR1.LoL nah in a luxury sedan, a freaking fully loaded Cadillac CT6 is much more interesting . Ok Ok for the high price category a Maybach or Rolls Phantom.
Front looks like just a 4 door BMW i8
Doug sold out. If he was honest, his video would begin with "Thiiiiiiiiis is a hideous overpriced car!"
Looks bad
looks like an accord lmaoo
This car is a one big joke! Even older S class or BMW 7 series is supperior over this joke! 1000000 $ price for idiots. J.C.
It doesn’t look nearly as good as a Toyota Camry. Crazy.
5 in features?? Should be a 3 or 4.
Front looks like a Mazda 6, Back does too a bit, side looks like a dodge challenger....Man if you got a million dollar to blow on a car and you spend it on this your a special kind of stupid.
* Doug’s wife shows him her breasts * Doug- THIS is amazing....
I actually love the looks of this car, but there’s just no fucking way I’d pay 1M. There’s no justification for that price tag.
That shit look like a fuckin accord fam tf
It's nice, but I think the new Bently Flying Spur looks much better.  Now that car is breath taking.
looks like a Honda Accord from the front
Could you do an entire video about if you crashed something like this
It looks like a stylish Dacia from the 80's and its even caled Taraf 🤣 which means small band of popular music 🤣🤣🤣.. the word taraf actually means party in arabic
Looks like hybrid of genesis and car from gta v
Essentially an extended uglier Rapide still with the Los infotainment. But only allowed to drive 2500 miles a year - collectors only then. Best to source on DuPont for half this price. Note O’Gara have had this car for nearly a year now.
Uh no.   Its not the most beautiful 4 door car. The proportions are positively *screwed*
1m$?!🤯,This is complettely shitbox With 1m$ can buy a 918 spyder,mclaren p1 etc why you need this shit 🤦‍♂️
https://youtu.be/gDhj9LRV6g0
It looks like a fancy Honda Accord..especially from the front
Fun fact: the word “Taraf ترف” is an Arabic word meaning Luxury
Looks like a camaro from the side.
another trash car... nothing looks appealing it's a over priced ford... gtfoh...
Worlds most ugly
I live down the street hahah
it looks so ugly .....bmw & merc looks better not worth the money....rolls royce is the ultimate luxury
literally ugly
A million for that thing? I'll buy a used M2 Comp for $70K, maybe leave another $30K for upgrades/maintenance, roll up next to said Lagonda, and simply laugh at it. What an absolute waste of money, and a real disappointment from a company that should be able to deliver something much better for that kind of price tag. It looks nice, it's kind of fast, it's rare, big whoop. This should be around $120K, max.
Lagonda - for when you really want to impress your fourth child bride
It's been pretty hot out here in Cali as you can tell by Doug
wheels look like a chevy car, even bowtie. front looks like camaro and ford fusion mix. rear looks neat at best. you are a sycophant to the pricetag doug demuro
at least they're aware Aston build quality is so shitty they skipped a sunroof.
I'd rather have an 80's Lagonda with an LS swap than this
Mathew Mcchonaughey  saw this and said....."Alright, alright, alriiiiiiiiight"  Time to replace the Lincoln.
this car is having a serious identity crisis...
Million dollars and no T-Tops? WTF?
hideous.  a Dodge Charger with a challenger sized front end.  barf.
seems like a waste of money...
If the challanger is a boat, this is a fucking YACHT
I prefer rolls royce thanks
Was this car designed in 2010 ? 💀
It's not good looking car at all, in my opinion
Aston Martin better give Honda back its grill before they sue 💀
Aston Martin is the most overrated brand in the history of four wheeled things
Whys the front look like a Ford focus
Takes 40K to actually Build....."lets see what dumbass pays 1M for this"
Am Aston Martin woth a 2021 hon dd's a accord front end
I mean Koenigsegg didn't just release the Gemera Hyper sedan with 1700HP for $1.7M ...but yea this looks ..ugly for 1M
He should review a g35 and 350z
so ugly
Yep, very distinctive... Should be easy to distinct new Hyundai Elantra from this ASTON MARTIN LAGONDA Taraf
Doug is the type of guy to show up with a Kia stinger to review a million dollar car
This is one ugly car
When a rolls ghost and quattroporte meet
Looks like an accord tho
Easy come easy go. No one. No one who earned money the hard way would spend money on something like this.
So basically a $1,000,000 deviated stitching leather option for your Austin Martin Rapide or DB9? 🤔
I love it.
Navigation from ford, speakers from audi, the overall price 1 mln.$$$???
Doug roasts the shit out of Lexus for their infotainment and other things  but  THISSSSSSSSSSSSSS is the best looking 4dr Sedan of all time 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ Lmfaooo this thing ain't worth 1Mill forsure. I don't even like Phantoms but damn lmao this thing is a joke 😂
im just here to add to comments saying how this car is no where near what it's worth. ugly and nothing special inside or out
It looks like a Ford Mondeo Vignale
I’d rather have an S63 and a phantom
A million dollar car and no sunroof...
If they can make such a beautiful car, why did they make that awful looking SUV(DBX)?
I don't think Doug knows how to rate value. This should be a 1.
Car pog
This is one quirky ass dude
Looks like michael car in gta 5
Kinda look like Honda Accord
what do you even get for the extra 600,000 grand? besides saying you spent a million dollars on a car. Just why?
Doug tried his first molly in this car
10:15. “This little hydraulic” which is actually a pneumatic strut. Never heard a hydraulic.
looks like a castrated model s,  just shooting from the hip
That Lamborghini at start looked dope though
i want a review of cls 350cdi mercedes 2012
love the idea that a car can only be cool if people know what it is 😂. i adore it but they were taking the piss on the price weren't they.... guess there aren't as many gullible sheikhs as am thought 😂
This review seems like a bribe. Not even anywhere near the best looking sedan ever.Did Lagonda sponsor this review?
4:23 “The rear end styling”. It looks like the distinguished grandfather of a Ford Fusion. It looks like Ford, Jaguar and Aston are still in bed with one another.   “Thhhissss is a 2021 Ford Crown Victoria Mach 12”
Whenever dealership have problems selling stupidly expensive cars, doug was there to justify the reason behind it
Nice Ford Fusion.
I’m a fan of your review and usually agree with you . This time I don’t , this car is actually literally ugly !
The way he says “luxury” makes me very uncomfortable
1 million dollar car with exposing hydraulic on the doors. Great
Looks like an old Honda Accord euro. Lagonda taraf - Honda Accord. Even the names are similar
More like mazda 3 sedan with longer proportion
Does anyone else see what I see?   Honda Accord Headlights Ford Fusion Grill Dodge Charger taillights   I’ll take a Phantom and drive by laughing knowing you spent 2x
The back looks like a concept Chevy Camaro while the front like a fusion and a Genesis  had a baby. 👎
Whether the navi sucks or not is irrelevant, what's important is that it can be hidden away. In a couple of years even the best system will be obsolete and this car will be collectible for decades to come. The Bugatti Chiron has no navi screen for this very reason.
lagonda looks like a ford sedan.
Ill taike one in emerald green
This shit looks like a ford taurus in the front lol
This!!!!!
over over over priced just because of the demand
I didn’t like it bro
Imagine how many the IIHS had to crash test lol
Doug.. You talked too much at the start of this... 'Blah, blah blah.. Most expesnivest ever--the Aston Mary Martin Asheesh Giraffe 680G.... Bloppity, blop blahh... Commercial for crap car site...Sucha beautiful rare car never sold in North Americus USA, blah blah blah... This car is at the Ogota Aston Mary Martin Asheesh Stealership in Cally, California, West Coast Southern Cal. Blabbity, BLAHHH...it cost one milllllllion cash..... BLAHHH, BLAHHH.. Did I say only 100 were sold.... Bloobity blahh'
Doug is gonna be terribly mistaken when he reviews the next beautiful luxury sedan 🤣
This car looks like a Honda Accord
Me : I have this car someone : wow really? Me: yes In GTA
THISSSS is a Toyota Corolla and a suitcase filled with $980,000.
This shit is nothing man... stop the hype!
Ha. My Dodge caliber has a fridge in the glove department. It's only a 15k car (new)
I would buy two Rolls Royce 🤣
Front end looks like a Ford Taurus police interceptor  Edit: HA! Doug just used Ford Taurus as a model name comparison 😂
Where is your centenario video? I couldn't fine one
The only reason why you would buy this over a Rolls is because you can
one million dollars.  No rear ventilated seats.  It’s absolutely insane to me that the people that drop a million dollars on a car like this are just ok with Aston just not putting stuff in and cheaping out on stalks and stuff.
They made a special Lagonda umbrella but had to use a Ford Focus turn signal stalk..
Nice I'll take ten dozen
THHHIIISSSSSSS .... is crap !!!
even jeff bezos would say that's too muuuuuch for a car that looks like Honda accord
Chill guys this is just a fancy car. Not worth giving a million dollar for this. 🥱
Basically Ford was almost bankrupt at the time this came out and they wanted to make quick money
Only stupid people would buy this
Doug, honestly don’t see how you think this is a beautiful motorcar... odd proportions
Front like honda accord 🤪
There's no way it looks better than a Rolls Royce. Rolls Royce cars age beautifully. This already looks kind of dated. Sports and luxury don't go well together.
Ill take a lincoln town car for 3 grand
Aston Martin: how do we recoup the losses from our rapide development ? .... Aston Martin: we'll launch the facelift for 1 mil and call it a taraf... #sclass Maybach is way cooler
I'm sorry Doug but this thing is ugly...
The front just looks like a Ford.
Even with rarity nothing about this car is worth that much or anything above 100K. Useless waste of money for sure.
Imagine paying 1 million dollars for a shitty infotainment system, no sunroof at all and a shitty steering wheel.
for a million dollars the back seat better be a maybach and not an alfa romeo.
The exterior looks unfinished and for the price the center seams in the ceiling the leather appears bubbled out. I’m sorry but nowhere does this seem luxurious. It seems like a basic sedan wrapped in 3 cows worth of leather.
Sorry but it’s fugly.
Sorry Doug, but I'm Egyptian and that translation is incorrect... " Ultimate luxury " translates to فخامة ( Fakhama )
The Porsche Panamera still looks better.
I do wish his site well!
Ug*ly as sh*t...I'll take a nice used W140 S600 over that million dollar piece of cr*p...a very nice used S600 probably cost less than 20k and much nicer
I’ll take a used Rapide, Hoovie’s seems to be holding up.
Not even carbon ceramic brakes, among many things missing.
Overpriced Honda Accord
Hey Doug, can you do a video about a 2017-2020 Lincoln MKZ please!!
Seems like you’re just paying for the name. It’s nice but the features don’t put it over a Phantom.
Rather buy a new S Class for 90% less than a Lagonda
When will we get an honest review, "yea this car is way overpriced and it kinda sucks".....
This guys delivery makes me want to punch myself in the nuts. :/
HOW DOES HE GET THIS?!?!
It looks like a dodge
Horrible GPS unit.  Mind as well tape an iPad in front of it.
I will take a Phantom for about half the price
Million Dollar Score=24 😂 dude.. Are you serious Million Dollar again and again. We came to know it's Million dollar in the Ist time you told. This guy got some serious million dollar issue😂
To be honest with you, I'll still choose the Maybach anytime any day this is bullshit luxury 😒, no massage seat, no ambient lighting, just look at the infotainment system, the tech is far behind, there's no reason to buy this, it doesn't even look like a classic car, look at where they kept the umbrella by the time you go to the boot to collect the  umbrella 🌂 the rain would have redesigned your suit
Honda Accord, Ford Fusion, Dodge Challenger and AM DB9 having an orgy
Million dollars for that? Lol even if I had millions to waste I wouldn’t even think of getting this car. Being that this thing is a million dollars is crazy
OK luxury car + lots of leather + 75 badges + wealthy but brainless buyers = $1Million.  Designed for the desert, included heaters but not ventilated seats.  Makes sense.  Get an S Class and give it the Brabus or Mansory treatment (or something less tacky) and it will be unique.  Anyone who buys this is a toolbox.
Oh god! I dont know if I got the headache by listening to this horrible commentary or looking at the ugly car. You were hugely mistaken to say E38 BMW 7 series was nicer? Doug mate you nedd to rethink your life choices. Get outta here. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Tbh I think it's ugly. A huge waste of money.
Looks less luxurious than my 2019 Infiniti QX80... Which by the way is not the most luxurious vehicle in it's class.  Geez
You have to be pretty dumb to waste your money on this car.
The front looks like a Ford Fusion
Are your knees ok sir.
how is this car not British Racing Green? ??
Nice ford taurus
What an ugly car
Lol imagine paying a million dollars the same interior Aston has been using since like 2005...
Only Arabians will buy this ugly car!!😂😂😂😂
It looks like a Honda Accord
One million dollars....like Austin Powers
Lagonda would be your money but I like the fridge!
My 745i can compete with this car in luxury and looks. Bought it for only 2500$ with 128km 2owner clean title😂
I wouldn't say this looks beautiful. The rear looks like a tesla and overall pretty lackluster. You can get a nicer interior from a Merc S-class for 1/10 the cost.
Sub to Caden Lagan
Does this use Supremium gas? I nominate the Supremium guy from the Exxon Mobil commercial to rightfully do this review with his voice 😂😂😂😂
I always love Doug’s appreciation of obscure and mundane cars but his obsessions with this car is confusing. It looks like a quattroport and he’s made It clear...Maserati’s are overrated.  However, I’ll watch anything Doug reviews. Keep it up!
I’m dissapointed with the crappy steering wheel and lack of self closing doors. I’d rather have a RR phantom EWB and some spare money for a Good lambo
Sticker price of one...  Me: oh 100.000 doesnt sound like that much  Him: oneeeee million   Me: flips table
I like it. But for a Million dollar car the bolt that holds down the windshield wipers is usually covered by a cap and it's not.
The reason the back seats have more headroom is to fit the turban inside as well
I hate that c pillar. The front and rear look amazing.....but that c pillar is nasty
Could you name the any Global Brand with country which oriented? Beside than follow? cuz i just wanna know...  USA: Apple Tesla GM Intel Google Ford Amazon Walmart Chevolet Microsoft AMD Goldmansachs JP Morgan etc...  Japan: Toyota Lexus Honda Accura Nissan Infinity Mazda Sony Softbank  South Korea: Samsung LG Hyundai Kia Genesis Pasco SK?  China: Alibaba Aliexpress Huawei  Germany: Mercedez-Benz BMW Volkswagen Porche Lamborghini Bently Mini Siemens etc.  France:  Peugeot Chanel Louis Vuitton Hermes Bugatti etc.  Itary: Ferrari Gucci Alfaromeo  Sweden: Ikea Volvo  Swiss: Rolex  British: Jaguar Land Rover Range Rover McLaren Aston martin   Its weird that I could only came up with 10 countries brand... there will be alot more than I know right?  I probably missed a lot of it! so could you please name the global brand (which every people Know in the world) and country both please?
I prefer Mercedes S class
Hoovie in 2030: i bought the cheapest taraf in the world
Wouldn't pay more than $50,000 for whatever this is...
I just love the way Doug got down on his knees in a grovelling fashion paying the ultimate respect at 8:43. LOL.
Is that a Jetta?
er...the front look kinda like the 2020 sonata...
It looks dated inside and has a lot of useless features and gadgets that would rarely get used and that interior colour is sickening. But I do like the paint and wheels. I'd rather get a Model S.
Imagine paying 1 million for a car that doesn't even have Apple Car Play/ Android Auto.
Its not hand stitched, its stitched with a sewing machine. hand stitched means that you take a needle and tread and stitch it with by hand which is a tremendous task, often irregular and totally pointless to do in a car.. just a little correction here :-)
Funny how some get off on the word "most expensive", as if that always equate to quality and craftsmanship being on par.For 1 million, that car better come with 1000 shares of Amazon stock.
Looks as minimalistic as a tesla
Nice car but not worth the money
ЗЗЗЗЗиииисссс
Where does zagato sit in the range?
Almost as good looking as a 2021 Genesis G90.
This car is a legal SCAM. It will be used for money laundering.
People saying it looks like a ford mondeo , probably think that Cocoa Puffs look like fruity pebbles. It’s generally similar but it’s made differently and the lines are much different
they just want to fool wealthy arabs!
looks like ford falcon Australia model
Title should be, the most overpriced car in world history.
did we mention it's LUXURY ??????
I CANNOT wait for the centenario video to come out 😍😍
Wow, lol... This car is the most beautiful 4-door sedan you've EVER SEEN?!  Incredible. Absolutely incredible. I couldn't even keep watching lmao.
Beautiful or not middle east people are loaded but not dumb
What even is this. This is just paying $1 million for a first gen Rapide but it looks slightly better and it’s slightly longer
Front looks like a 2018 honda accord.
tHiS iS a
Never worth 1 million.....
Doug: reviewing a million dollar sedan, dressed like he’s about to mow the lawn.
it sais lagonda on da badge cause astin would never put his name on  badge wich is attached to this peace of ...,
Review the Escalade 2021 bro
how is this car so expensive??
This car looks like it took some styling cues from Honda and kia, with Ford focus interior. I mean its a really nice car and all but its $150k . Aston Martin must be crazy selling a car for 1mil with very basic amenities. But I guess if you buying this car for value bc of limited production I guess...
The Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf Is the World's Most Ugliest  Luxury Sedan “Ever”!!
worst review and car ive ever seen (not only car review. but all forms of reviews i ever encountered together with shitmobiles from wherever street or highway i ever been on)
Former co-president of Canadian Jewish Congress: “What Are We Going to Tell Our Children When They Ask Us ‘What We Did [to Stop Forced Organ Harvesting]’?” Rabbi Dr. Reuben Bulka, former co-president of Canadian Jewish Congress, said he appreciates David Matas and David Kilgour, who had this groundbreaking discovery of what was going on in China. The recent investigation shows that the organ harvesting in China continues.   “The question we have to ask ourselves, aside from the wonderful ideas that David has brought up, we should make sure that there’s no free government in the world that allows this type of organ harvesting of seeking organs in China.”   “We also have to ask ourselves what we can do as individuals. How do we send a message? And maybe we have to ask, like when it came time for the Olympics, we called for a boycott of the Olympics, that it shouldn’t take place there [in Beijing].  “It was a travesty that it did. It should never have taken place. And now maybe we have to ask ourselves what are we going to tell our children when they ask us what we did?”
8:45 I wonder if Doug has ever thought about wearing knee pads lol. I'd imagine his knees would hurt after so many car reviews!
The grill looks like a ford mondeo
Million dollar Hyundai Camry
Wheels look aftermarket. Like they belong on a civic
2021 Honda Accord Long Boi
phantom shits on this bruh not even close
In back seat refrigerator, can it accommodate a 5 liter box of Vella wine 🥃🐇
Lol my dad drove one of these the other day they are insane,it was from the princess of Qatar biggggg money 🤯
Aston Martin has always made exquisite cars... Until now.
the most gorgeous 4 door sedan. u reaching now doug. how much the Ogara pay u to say that. don't be a sell out man we starting to see u goin that route
Sorry, Doug. You’re dead wrong on this one. It is not the most beautiful sedan ever made. This hot trash looks like a bootleg car from GTA V.   It’s limp wristed with only 550hp due to the weight. This car is missing about half of the “luxury” features that a 2017 GMC Denali has.   So, the design is generic, it’s 200hp short of what it needs and is missing very basic luxury features that mass produced “luxury” vehicles under $100k have had for half a decade.
My 2012 Ford Fiesta has a capless fule system. This car is for dummies (assuming someone actually bought the damn thing).
Pretty....but not beautify imo
I applaud you for figuring out how to compare a Ford Taurus to a Lagonda
no wonder this car is available in only in dubai because obviously they are the client base stupid enough to spend a million on this scam of a car
Cool video doug....taraf in malay language means standard/status....cool car nonethless....but the value hunter the side of me would rather get a aston martin rapide instead ofthis
Well, Aston sold them all which is watertight proof that there really are people in the world with much more money than sense.
Better than Yugo, huh?
Not impressed
I don't see why this car is worth $1m....
“Most beautiful sedan” literally looks like a Honda accord
Thats one ugly car
So you basically pay 1m$ for a leather wrapped rapide??
At the beginning of the video (as I am right now) I was thinking that's one of the ugliest modern luxury sedans I've ever seen as even the color doesn't seem right to me. Then, right away, Doug says he truly believes that it is beautiful, breathtaking, gorgeous and so on. My jaw dropped.
Looks like a Rapide and a Honda Accord mashed into one. I think it would look so much better in a gloss colour, the matte/satin black just looks like it’s been wrapped. I really don’t see much beauty in it. The newer Aston Martins coming out look much better imo.
Maybach is more luxurious inside with less price tag. Change my mind
The headlight look like a honda accord
So it’s an uglier rapide with a different name
I don't really get the point of paying a lot of money for a car just to say "i'm one of the only one to have it" if it doesn't have anything to justify the price on technical side. I guess it is for vuitton people...
cant open the roof either?
not worth 1 mill at all but a beautiful car
Sorry Doug your waaayyy of base calling it the best looking 4 door car ever!!
Hmmmm.  Over priced Ford Fusion
The front reminds me of an accord idk why
looks like a stretched honda accord
sexy as hell
“Child Seat Anchor Hider”  Doug, you’re the best!
Paint reminds me of the crappy wrap I've been pulling off my alfa 156 parts car. Not a fan.
Worst thing about that car is the ugly flat color. its looks bad on every car
I would rather take a bmw X3 then this 1,000,000 dollar luxery car 👎
british rash
review the GV80
Reading through the comments, glad to see that I'm not the only one who thinks this car isn't that good looking. It's "ok".  Maybe a 5 on styling.  Definitely not 10.
This car looks alot like a Toyota Allion, which cost about $20k.
Every second in this video: ''Lagooooonda Taraaaaaaaf''
I think it’s ugly
No need for ventilated seats! There is a bottle cooler in the back! Aaah... luxury. 😂
The front looks like a Honda Accord... Which surprisingly, I love
How has nobody mentioned the Centenario in the beginning?
2 ipads and 2 ipad holders probably was $5000 extra
“THISSSS is the biggest waste of money since the invention of the automobile.”
Can’t wait to buy this in 10 years on cars and bids for 25k
Would be pretty awesome if someone let you review their Aston One-77
what will happen if u crashed the car?
Did Doug happen to mention the price of this Lagonda, NOT an Aston Martin?  If so, I must have missed it.
Shit looks like an accord wackkk
The luxury brand Has a luxury brand.
Phantom is way better than this car
I like the aston martin brand (specifically the coupes) but this sedan is ugly as sin.
Doug: "Very distinctive front end..."  Honda Accord: "Am I a joke to you?!"
not impressed with the front clusters at all
what the fuck door hydraulics that's so basic tech every car should and could have these
The red taillight doesn't change to red. The amber lights up in between the red LEDs...
“They’re charging that much just because they can” JC
Cars with ashtrays just seem outdated for some reason. Also, who wants a car like this to smell like smoke lol
The front of this car looks a little like the 2019 accord
it's definitely gorgeous
Ngl the front end of this car gives me serious Dodge Charger vibes lol
I don't care much for the exterior design. Doug is bigging it up and perhaps it's different in person but from where I'm sitting, it looks like a Chinese knockoff of a Volvo with an Aston Martin front end. It's timeless but in the same way a bus is timeless. Timeless dull.
Anybody else thinks this car should be less than 500k
1:26 I can't unsee those swirl marks! What the hell are they doing letting that car not only sit on their forecourt but also letting Doug film it! I'd be embarrassed. "special cars for sale" lol
kind of looks like a genesis...
This shouldn be a 1 milion dolar car...
I didn't see nothing in this car!
Looks like a Honda Accord. And they want how much for it???
my lexus has a fridge, way cheaper.
Btw the word Taraf is Arabic for lavishness and luxury
Doug falling off
Doug definitely got paid to make it sound more luxurious than it is
I can't imagine a single reason to buy this car no matter how rich you are...even an s class from 10 years ago is more luxurious than this
Looks like an old ass masserati Quattroporte lol
What a waste of money
It's a 2 shirt kinda day
million dollar car with a gaudy keyhole on the door that sticks out like a sore thumb.  Horrible.
Aston Martin needs their ass beat for this price tag and basic dashboard
Buy my car, buy it now! That's all I hear throughout this video...SMH lol
Is it only me who had literally no idea this existed.
Ok. I’m a simple man. So let me ask a simple question. While my S-class is not $1million dollars, it has retracting curtains and a rear sunscreen. Why no curtains here? Please don’t tell me it’s a “feature”. And no matter how many times the price and the term “luxury” are mentioned, I just don’t see a $1million dollar effort here. The dash reminds me of a Toyota. And any parts from a “Ford focus” is just a no-brainer no-no to use here, but they did. Yeah...even if I had $1million to spend on a sedan, I’ll be perfectly good in the latest S-class Maybach edition. But I give props to Doug for trying his best to make those horrible center console buttons somehow seem worthy of a $1million dollar vehicle.
Wait, what. Ten? F you Doug, I'm outta here -_-
What the actual f**k. Few seconds into the video I thought Doug is using some weird lens or something, but well... The exterior of this car indicates it is some chinese knock-off. That's all I have to say. I don't even care to look inside. Even if I would own and drive it, remembering its' outside proportions would make me drive it off a cliff.. Why would anyone drive it. It's unbelievably hideous compared to Rapide. Or literally any other sport/luxury sedan.
Oh and taraf doesn't mean luxury in arabic (I'm arab btw)
This car better come with a butler, that would explain the extra $850k
the gushing isn't warranted.
Is this some sort of joke 🤭
those scores are insane,,, not relative to past videos... doug please PLEASE do not sell out or be influenced in your ratings/reviews... or at the very least please communicate this video is sponsored by and this is my honest and uninfluenced opinion... stay true doug, thanks
Looks like a GTA car
I love Aston Martins (lagonda).However, come on Aston!!!!!!They always seem to be able to get it wrong in the end. A million dollar car, performance, beautiful, luxurious.......and once again they run out of ideas and make do with an indicator stalk from a Ford focus. I ain't no snob but they've been doing this since the 1970s.If I had the kind of money to be able to buy a top of the league car, the second I see something like that I'm walking away and saying.....Hello Rolls Royce Wraith!!!!!
God bless your knees
Wow nice Honda Accord
And the state of California has to mess up the front of this car with the need to have a front license plate.
This thing was mad trash for the time and very, very overpriced. You're dumb is you buy this over its competitors. Imagine paying 1 million for a luxury car and it doesn't even had a power trunk.
Looks like a modified Taurus/Charger.....ugly.
I was waiting for a perfect 10/10 in styling. The Lagonda Taraf certainly deserves it.
9:22 imagine him breaking the handle as he opens the door
If I have to hear "million dollars" from Doug's big ass tongue again I'm going to unsubscribe
I would take the amg gt 4 door coupe over this at any day I don't see that this car even worth 200k$
THIS
My old as dirt 2007 audi s8 had bang and olufsen sound system that also had the rising tweeters in the dash. Not that cool for a fresh million 🤣🤣
I feel like its just a longer, more boujee ford fusion with a v12
Actually the Pronunciationin in Arabic should be tarf not taraf 🙂🐓
Doug is the type of guy to close the fridge day with his hip
Was anyone else scratching their head like me, saying, "Uh you lost me on this one, Doug"
I can't tell if Doug is being sarcastic or genuine in this review. Hope he is being genuine because it'll be a shame if its biased. This is a sports saloon at best as it comes no where near ultimate luxury.
How can you buy this car and not feel like a fool?
So ugly
Bruh it’s got the Toyota Camry rear end
Doug is a king of guy that praises a million dollar Taraf for having a soft close trunk.😂
It was built to separate arabs from their petro-dollars.  Like taking candy from a baby.  Selling a North American audience on this is a reach.  My used Q70 is hardly less luxurious than this, with a sunroof and cooled seats too.
Ever seen a Rapide?
How much champagne are people actually drinking in these ultra-luxury cars? Is champagne the primary beverage for the rich?
This has ALMOST exactly the same front grill as a 2020 Honda Accord.
1 million for this? I want to know what the buyers smoked before buying this.
10:03 Doug: The door stays exactly where you want it...   Car door: Eff you Douggie!
doug the type of guy to open a glass door to look outside
The silhouette of this car is wonderful, but the interior is somewhat disappointing
Aston Martin: Hey let's add an umbrella for a luxury sedan that we made for people in the desert
Would rather have a phantom 😂
Looks like a 2010 Malibu
This car is total crap 💩
the front is copied from mazda
That's the most expensive foot and a half I've ever seen.
I like Lagonda realized that a lot of people who own it will be old and might have trouble getting out of the car so they added a luxurious handicapped bar😂
I wouldn't pay 150k for that fucking thing
I thought you’re reviewing a Chrysler
ترف
is no one noticing that Doug is on both his knees at various points in this video
The backend looks like the paragon from gta 5 if I’m not trippin
is that a hyundai????????????
Cool so instead of spending money on something that could help research and save lives you work on a vehicle to hopefully make even more money to neglect the human race with. The race that you are apart of sharing the planet with.
Alot of talking and rambling about nothing..very lame
Pathetic car, pathetic review
The wheels look like 200€ AEZ s
Aston Martin should make a car with a really really long hood and call it the Lagonda Garaf.
9:57  Doug talks about the precision of the door that would stay intact when opened \ 10:04 The door moves
Have you driven a Ford lately
There was a version of a Taraf that had white leather with a lot of black in the interior to provide contrast. I feel like the interior of this particular car being all basically the same color is really overwhelming and kind of tacky.
For that price it better be a bat mobile
Ironically, one has come up for sale. I guess this video was sponsored by Aston Martin of Beverly Hills. Doug is basically getting paid to do high end car advertisements. Pathetic.
Looks like a challenger
no sunroof, no ventilated seats - I'll stick with a civic thanks
I’m pretty sure this car is a joke
There is something wrong with its looks. That ultra-modern front doesn't fit those "classic" sides. That's how I see it.
Dougs the type of guy to eat soap so he can clean out his heart
URGENT‼️Jesus is Coming Soon Repent Turn from you Sins and Trust/believe in JESUS Hell is not worth It Jesus Loves so muchhhhh Trust in him  God blesses you everyday so why disrespect him and continue Sin follow him this World is Corrupted and Full with Sin and Hatred God Brings True Peace and Joy Try it just Bow down and Pray Release all your Burdens onto Jesus Don’t get Left behind God Bless you Amen 🙏🏽🙏🏼🙏🏻🙏🏿🙏🏾✝️😌🙌Hallelujahs
Never knew this even existed
How do I load half a dozen wooden cases of whine or shamepagne into the trunk?
I think doug was high when he reviewed this stupid machine which DOES NOT EVEN COOL YOU ASS BUT YPUR CHAMPAGNE,
High rear wing!
Volkswagen Phaeton at 100k is waaaay more luxurious than this car
This car is a grift, the people at Aston Martin, oh sorry, _"Lagonda"_ must not think much of the Arabs.
Ugh... let's stat with an advertisement.
I'm from Saudi Arabia and I've never ever seen this luxury car 😅
Seriously tho, for a million bucks I would want the USB socket facing and the rear center panel all in matching piano black. The USB sockets could easily have been hidden behind the gloss surround without the need for the grey plastic. Damn the fingerprints, the chauffeur can wipe them off!
Wow, Rolls Royce has almost all (if not more) the luxury this car has. Yet, a Rolls is cheaper. Aston made a car so that rich people could say a Rolls Royce is cheap.
No sun roof ...garmin navigation...4 seater car....old style tachos...two ipad... definitely for mad shieks who want to blow unwanted 1million ...even 1/4 costing panemera is more better...
This thing would solve all problems in the Ozark
Interesting car, I just couldn't pay 1 million for a Genesis look alike!
My 2012 S63 is twice as good as this lol.  I have vented seats that massage and 50 more horsepower in a v8. Oh and I paid 40k.
from Kenya.... the middle east sheikhs and British aristrocacy owners of this car   may sue Aston Martin for allowing Doug to drive the $1m Taraf while in shorts,sneakers and t shirt.....!.
And the soft close?
Throughout the video,he emphasised on “Lagonda LOGO”
This things was to expensive and looks like a stretched fusion..  really with ford parts. Ridiculous it should be called More like LaFonda for its unique name
TBH, not even worth of $100K!!
I think DeMuro needs glasses.  I don't think it's even as attractive as the Rapide let alone other sedans like the Jaguar XJL, both the current and past models.  And no sunroof?  And no integrated rear monitors, just knee scrapers?  Would not be on my list of purchases.
Criticize 2008 Maserati for not having touchscreen, but 2018 Aston Martin with technology straight from 2006 is luxurious for him...
17:03 "it was just what aston martin had at the time" my 2016 mercedes cla had more features in the touchscreen
*Me backs my 2008 Honda Civic Hybrid  into Lagonda Taraf*  The General "YOU WHAT"
Looks like a car from the 90s
It looks like an over priced Ford Taurus from the front
This is probably the first video where I disagree with Doug at so many things.  First I think the video was unnecessary  long, because the car is not that interesting and doesn't have so much quirks at all (Aston Martin like every other more or less). Second, the styling is obviously in the eye of the beholder, to me its nothing special. It's obvious they tried to modernise the older Lagonda looks and it looks ok, but it's not even remotely beautiful as Doug emphasises. Nevertheless Doug always finds a way to deliver interesting cars, kudos !
I know the guy who bought it. He wasn't feeling it lol
Honestly that's more like a $250k car at most wtf
Doug, I just bought a base model Ford Taurus. It’s a Little Tikes car compare to that Lagonda. I no longer want my Little Tikes car.
Drinking game : take a shot every time Doug says “distinctive”
Feel the exterior looks just fine..
Why does this car cost so much? I don't see anything special here
I see a lot of angry comments trashing this car....You're missing the point here, this car is meant to be exclusive and rare.
Fugly!
The keyhole on the door is so weird. a million dollar car def shouldn't have one lol
I really think this car was a cash grab. They knew the Middle East has stupid amounts so they could make a few changes, give it a new name, and sell it for 3x or more what they should have in the Middle East only. I have to imagine a $1m car to an oil heir in the Middle East is like a doctor in the US dropping $100k in a car.
It’s a luxury Honda Accord (2020) 🤣
Looks like a car from GTA
No sunroof?!!
May your parents live more than the life of a turtle If,,,,,      by the way my blog IDEABATIC. BLOGSPOT. COM.
Had to go back to the beginning of the vid to confirm it is a 2018 and not a 2008 model. WOW. No vented seats no, no infotainment, not even a temp setting on the A/C but Ford Focus switchgear? For a MILLION USD?Don't get me wrong it is a really, really beautiful car but a million bucks? Not even f I had that money to spare.....
For once I'm not sad that I don't have a million to buy a car.
“I am thankful for all of those who said NO to me. It’s because of them I’m doing it myself.”
I'm not sure, but there still must be 40-50 Tarafs parking somewhere in the backyard of the Aston Martin headquarters, reminding the CEO, while looking at them, that there are no 120 idiots in the entire world, who give a million bucks for a car, that looks like a Ford cousin worth maximum 149.000 $. As I said, I'm not sure. Maybe all of them are still parking there.
The rear side view looks like a dodge charge
Doug: *Gets pulled over*  Also Doug: *Walks to the police car*  THISSSSSS...
How the hell is all these unreliable junk is the most expensive sedan?
But does it fly?
Taraf does not mean ultimate luxury in arabic....
Doug is the type of guy to bring food from his home to the restaurant
When you pay half this price for a Ferrari or Lambo you get all the attention in the road but with this no one will ever think that this cost more than 40 grand :/
Doug, I love you, but 10/10 for styling? Really? I also would take a Rolls or even a Maybach over this if I was in the market. No way this car is better than either of those.
This car for $1m is a total fraud.  Mercedes S class is far better, it is nowhere near any RR in luxury,  Bentleys are far more luxurious as well - and the list goes on... truth be told.  Though it is good for the Arabs 😁   cos they are easily tricked in that way... it befits their (out of place ) ego 😁😁😁
Nice Fiat Tipo 👈
At this price, EVERTHING in that car, visible to the owner or not, *should be* bespoke. Look at the BMW Z8 -- it cost a fraction of what this car costs when new, and BMW paid the attention to detail and designed _everything_ afresh for just that one model, down to the power window swiches, switchgear and ORVM controls. Now that is true attention to detail that justifies the price and makes the car special. Putting in a turn signal from a Ford and a stock navigation system is simply inexcusable even if this car cost 1/4th of what it does! Frankly, this car is a piece of shit.
The body and leather interior are stunning. 10 out of 10. Doug, I have no problem with the Garmin system. I would trade the GPS system in my Jaguar for a Garmin any day.
"The badge says Lagonda, not Aston Martin". Probably because it's a Lagonda rather than an Aston Martin.
Thanks Doug!  Always love your videos, especially with the rare cars.  You were like an excited school boy doing the walk through, but got into the serious adult on the drive.  Incredible review!  I will be looking for one at CarMax!
Feels so biased. Man didn’t expect this from doug😔
The interior quality doesn’t even match a Bentley not worth it
Imagine paying $1 million for an Aston Martin.
Wow is that overpriced. Not worth $1m.
Value should be something like a 2 tbh. Overall features gets a 5 and he says it's still fairly worth 1mil??? Honestly, no adaptive cruise control, abysmal infotainment, no ventilated seats, and no sunroof, let alone a frost-able sunroof or a starry night sky. The only thing that almost makes this car a little cooler are the speakers that pop up.
it's a charger plus ford
lol all the comments saying he's getting paid to praise the car...look who lent it to him, the people selling it. So yeah would not be surprised tbh
Dodge+Tesla
That car lost me at 10:26 with that sound the door made...
Who else saw the Centinario in the beginning???
Circle pattern looks like Broguing
So disappointed in you Doug. I expected better.
centenario. oh heck yeah
Looks like a Volvo S90   And Honda Accord lol
“There’s a lot of a room for head back here”.........................
We not going to talk about that exposed keyhole? Didn't you drag an 80's Honda Civil for that? lolz
I want to like it but I don’t
Ok Doug. Iv watched almost all of Your videos. Love and agree with almost all of them. But this Aston video, come on!!!! How much are u getting paid to say the lies you are saying? This car won’t even be noticeable next to a Ghost/phantom/Mulsanne. As a matter of fact I’m confident 80% of ur followers would agree that even a s560 looks better. Don’t ruin your reputation over a few extra bucks. I’m assuming Aston gave u a good check worth at least 300k. Lot of money, i understand. But come on ur better then that.
One born every minute (in the Middle East).
That things worth 180 k tops!!!
My Suzuki S-Cross has a nicer infotainment system than this piece of crap...
1 million? nop  Bentley Flying Spur is $214.000 DBS Superleggera $329.000 911 Carrera 4S Cabrio $134.000 McLaren GT $210.000 Dodge Demon $85.000  All of these cool, luxury or fun cars for a total of $972.000, less than a single car "Lagonda''.
Yo dude you forgot to mention that they don’t use the aston Martin logo they use the logonda logo
C'mon Doug, quit using the term "hand stitched".  Auto makers, at least the ones interested in profit, do not employ people with needles and thread stitching by hand items like seats, dashboards, door panels, headliners etc.  The stitching is done by a commercial sewing machine.  The correct term is "machine stitched".  The operator obviously has acquired a good amount of skill to place those stitches exactly where they are supposed to go.  He or she does use that skill and hand-eye coordination to get the job done.  As for the car itself, it's a pretty nice $150,000.00 car.  If you pay a million bucks for this maintenance nightmare waiting to happen, you're nuts.
Damn, and I used to think 600k for Phantom was a scam when you compare it to Mercedes-Maybach.
What an expensive piece of junk
A million bucks and you have to look at that keyhole in the door?  CP
So basically nothing special, and charging it more for the sake of charging it more? Rolls Royce is better in every way lmao, car looks odd and wants to be sporty let luxurious at the same time? Sorry, Bentley Flying Spur does it better Want pure Luxury? Sorry Ghost/Phantom will kill this thing
this is what you spend your money on when you run out of things to buy.
Honestly, the front clip looks like a mixture of the Charger/Dart, and the rest of the car to me looks dated and civilian, it's good looking, but for that kind of money it just feels short of special aside from it's price and it's rarity, if made in the thousands, it would be a car very few double take on the road.
The front license plate mount really takes away from the front design.
This is a bunch of guys drinking beer and betting - wow many idiots with to much money can we find. We need more coach builders. How does this get a cool factor above 6 ?
Hi Doug, I agree with you that the Taraf is a very beautiful car. Possibly the most beautiful sedan on the market. But have a check of the 2012 Pininfarina Cambiano (though a Concept Car in a 2- and a 4-door version) that for my gusto is absolutely stunning. See https://www.motor1.com/photo/1023184/pininfarina-cambiano-concept-sketches-06032012-1023184/
Most non car guy on YouTube
I like it❤ Someone needs to buy it and let me drive it to Whole Foods🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well, with the prices of the Rapide dropping these Lagonda values must be in a nose dive. The interior is so much like my Rapide, it’s unbelievable. Makes me feel great about selecting the Aston Martin Rapide.
Really trying hard on the "distinctive" look of the headlights. Pretty sure most cars use that setup.. Should have the most awsome of EVERYTHING for a Mill !!!! BlueJob machine in the back????????
Looks like audi
For a million something 4 seater I'll take a Gemera
Why is the paint dull?
Doug: "At $1 million the Lagonda Taraf is the most expensive sedan in the world."  Bugatti Chiron: "Hold my Dom Perignon."
Ford fusion with a 1m dollar b badge
I’d take a Rolce Royce or a Mercedes Maybach anyday over this. Imo both look better and ooze way more class and luxury.  I guess this car sells in the Middle East cause it’s rare and cost a million, they won’t be buying it cause it’s best in its class.
Imagine buying this over a Phantom
A 2006 vw phaeton looks better and have more features lol....not to mention waayyy cheaper
the exterior is perfect but the interior is a rapids . No cooling seat no massage the infotainment is boring so what is the special thing Does worth the million dollars
Love watching this channel! Have always been into cars and after buy my s2000 i have fallen more inlove with cars ! That motivated me to start a YouTube channel it would be a pleasure if you guys check it out!
The most beautiful car you've ever seen. You've got to be joking, it's ugly as fuck. How much did aston pay you for this
Thing is ugly AF
Now i know why aston martin didnt want to put their name on that piece of swhit.
for 1 million it honestly looks very cheap :/
0:37 Lamborghini Centenario review when?
Beautifoul looking? For God sake!
The front looks like a bmw i8
I’m sorry this just looks like a Ford ...
Door handles doesn't even pop out automatically...SMH.
So happy that Quentin Tarantino took the time to record this!
So we can all agree that this is a Accord/Fusion mix with an uglier body shape?
I didn't  catch the year of this vehicle?
Price tase seems completely unjustified lol.  Maybe if it looked like the DB11 from NFS Heat...
Double the price of a rolls royce yet it’s got half the luxury
From the front it looks very much like a Genesis. Even the badge.
A lot of Ford/Volvo-stuff in that car. Note that the second language after English in the fuel door is Swedish: "Endast blyfri bensin". English, Swedish, French, German and Arabic, no Spanish :) Also the climate control comes from an old V70.
are you considering to review a dodge magnum? it looks quirky
I get that the styling is different from anything else on the road and there aren’t many of these available but it has features that you can find on any luxury car and it just doesn’t look special enough to justify the million dollar price tag.
love the matte paint
Aston steering wheels are ugly, in my opinion.
Good for funeral.🤣 Coffin with wheels 😂
Something wrong with your ...price I seen 1 halve that price...
We need the longest squeezed look sedan ever.   AM: yes
10/10 on the sarcasm Doug!
Does the car fly?....
https://youtu.be/o_TvjB5XmaI🙏
STILL.... i rather buy roll royce, its better in value LOL
I do believe this is the most beautiful sedan in the world.
I'll have a Golf instead of this.
Big question , will it do a burnout ? (Asking for a friend in Canada)
0:38 that’s the prettiest Centenario I’ve ever seen!
Ok, I'll say it:  This car looks like crap.  Everything about the exterior looks sort of but not quite like something else.  The grill reminds me of a Ford.  The rear end looks like a cross between a Chevy and a Tesla.  The side "lines" are reminiscent of a cross between a Tesla and a Dodge.  The door handle concept is straight out of a Tesla - the cheapest Tesla, the Model 3, not the cool handles from the S.  And all that brown leather on the interior looks like shit - literally, I've had poops that exact color.  The gauges and buttons in this 2018 look like they'd be right at home in 1998.  Throw in Aston's famous reliability and this thing is the opposite of luxury. Given how completely cool the tech in the last Lagonda Doug reviewed was, this turd is a sad joke.  A million dollars is insane, this is maybe a $150k car (and that's me being generous because of the top speed, it would be worth maybe $40k otherwise) with an extra $15k of seriously fugly leatherwork.  No, I'm not joking about the leather cost, you could probably get that done to your car for about $15k, you just wouldn't want to because it's fugly. Also, LOL at Doug gushing about the turn signals.  Yeah, dual color LEDs are under $10 each in low quantities.  Such "luxury".
It has to be illegal to price this car in super car territory
Styling influences from original lagonda
I’m sure he’s been paid to review this car to be as good as possible. Its styling is too dull for his higher than usual Doug score.
So we're going to act like we didn't see that the door wouldn't stay in position when close to the body if the car? 👀
This car is not even close to beautiful gtfo
Is it me or did anyone else notice the wrinkles and discoloration in the leather headliner Maybe I'm o.c.d but that would drive me crazy
If this had a Maserati logo Doug would have buried it.. Especially the accessories level which seems poor  Check out the slam reference on the gear box on the old Maserati models .. It's all a matter of opinion at the end but 1M for this is way overpriced. Nothing seems so special that validates such a price for this car.
It looks like it an Acura TL and a Dish Charger had a baby, and BMW is the granddaddy. The only thing that looks Aston Martin to me is the hood and MAYBE the tail lights. It's gorgeous, but not the best looking luxury sedan in my own personal opinion.
Review Toyota Tundra Platinum
Weird looking Fusion
Even my volkswagen golf has doors that stay in place everywhere...
Rubbish!! My Avanza is better!!
Anyone else think this just looks like a normal car and can be mistaken by honda accords, dodge darts, or even Hyundai? I don't see why Doug thinks the design is so special
I thought it was a BMW concept car at first 😂
Still not as cool as the old Lagonda ;)
Nah a rapid in my country is enough to make the government investigate my bank accounts!..
That the door handles have the same colour as the body rather than chrome is a good feature. But that one can see the 'intestines' of the brakes with those red brake shoes that look like guts filled with blood, is an unaesthetic item. My old Mercedes 190E (Type 201) possesses much nicer wheel rims that discreetly cover up such mechanical 'intestines'.  One other drawback are the rear-view mirros at 4:6 which stick out of the cicumference  of the car body  and into the air, like too big ears protruding out of a head. They look a bit 'forlorn'. At my Mercedes they are 'integrated' at the triangle formed at the end of the side window and the front door. A million-dollar car and Mr. DeMuro is still wearing those childisch looking short pants that really are not congruent to what he is talkig about. The turn signals is much too small to be seen, especially in sunny California. Well, you can lower the front window and give turn signals by sticking out your arm (for left turns) and raising up your arm up in the air (for right turns) which is the way to do it in Californa. Loganda Taraf - what a funny name and what a terrible car at 8:03. I still prefer the name Aston Martin. Just as I prefer the name Mercedes instead of Maybach. Ultimate luxury in Arabic means    لفخامة المطلقة   whereas 'Taraf' means a group of people of a certain allegiance or adherence, with which Aston Martin presumably means its customers for this car. However: the car body could have been inspired by Pininfarina,  Bertone, Giugiaro or Bruno Sacco (who designed my 190E). Its proportions are perfect and the lines are fluid. But 1 million $ give you only 12'500 $ per year (or only 1.041,66 per month) when you will live 80 years. So start saving money and get this car from the Aston Martin museum when you reach 81.
Not at all worth for the price it's asking.
Too overpriced, no one’s gonna buy this over a phantom 👎🏻👎🏻
This video has as many views as this car's pricetag
Honestly without any understatement or jealousy and doug did mention some of it. i will not said he totally pull out all great thing about this car but he should have precise that its too pricy and really not worth 1m. Too many rapid item. But its really a elegant car no matter what..not enough technology or luxurious item for that price. Yeah its definitely for nothing to do with money kind of people!..
How is this car more luxurious than the phantom or Maybach
Am I the only one to notice that the brake rotor directions changes from left to right?
1 day with 1.1 million views omg
From the side from the B-pillar back, it kinda looks like a 2008-2011 Chevy Malibu.
Hmmm. This a dodge dart in the front?
Imagine dough test driving lagonda for video and some drunkard hits with his cheap car.
What a waste of money!! No wonder they only made 120 of them 🙄
8:09 and it really should have stayed away. The best looking 4 door car ever? Seriously? Okay.
A KEY HOLE !? Talk about advance technologie.
Interior is filled with BHHEEAAUUTIFUL LEATHER. Does that leather cost atleast 100k? I mean you get roof with stars in rolls royce
Most beautiful? The front looks like a new Accord.
I didn't see anything that could justify the price other than the rareness of it.  I'd rather have 2 Phantoms....
$1mil for a stretched car from 2001. The middle east must have just too much money.
Everybody watching this will be Rich 💯💯💯🤑🤑
Personally, I'd say the Volvo s90 is definitely more beautiful.
Too much propaganda   Unsubscribe
That car is in desperate need of tint
Looks like honda city
i love how he thinks the maserati granturismo isnt that good looking but this is gorgeous, breathtakingly beautiful lol
10 in styling 💀
Thats the NON moving glass panel is the Volkswagen Jetta. Exactly same thing. Check it it out!!!
Anyone else think the front looks like the new Hyundai sonata?
I think that doug is giving this car a fairly even review. Yes it's a million dollar car but he points out a lot of flaws such as the turn signal switch, the console in front and rear, the steering wheel, ETC. I think he's just a bit too Aston Martin loyal sometimes.
aint no way this shit is worth 1M its more like 300k, but the real question is how much AM paid you for this?
Looks like a Dodge
David Lee has a million dollars and i'm sure he wouldn't go near this thing. even if it came with Lagonda socks
#FreeLeafy
Kinda looks like a Ford Focus to me.... and the interior is trash
It's ugly honestly
horrible design
I’ve tried watching these videos three or four times, but I keep falling asleep.
Rolls will laugh at this thing all year long.   You can maybe fool a middle east 'new rich' wanker with this thing,  that is why they 'only' sell this thing there.   Europe and USA will be a lot different challenge.      It can be nice to look at  and have  miles of stitching,  but it can't compete with a rolls in terms of materials,  finish and details.       I would personally drive it back to the factory once I see that  navigation, fucking ford turn signal, buttons,  lack of wireless charging  and the 'bottle cooler' chinesse  fan in my trunk!🤦🏽‍♂️
I know people are hating but I agree, this is 10/10 styling the best looking sedan. Id rather get other luxurious cars if I could but man oh man is this nice looking
You're not paying for the luxury, you are paying for the exclusivity, to be able to show that you can afford a million dollar car. There really is nothing special about that car other than it costs way more than other cars. Perfectly illustrated by the fact that it has a ford turn signal stalk, correct me if I am wrong but didn't VW have titanium stalks and switches made for the Veyron. Many other brands make individual components for their cars some of them quite beautiful.
Looks like a $25k charger
Just one ugly vehicle. No match for the iconic Rolls Royce Phantom.
I would rather pick Mercedes s650 or Audi A8/s8 or BMW 7/8 series or any Bentley or Rolls Royce, save tons of money and get better quality interior. This car should worth around £80,000 not £1m.
what a stupid tacky car ...
Sorry Doug, but this is the first video, that I consider boring, never had to skip so many times, because part of the video was not interesting. Car is cool etc, but I think you hyped too much about the price, at one point started to feel like the whole video is an ad.
Bentley is way better. Turn signal stock, switches, nav in this car is crap.
if this drove past me - i would think its a mid 2000s cheap sedan - not a 1 million pound car
Please review that Lamborghini Centenario please.
Austin Martian seems trying to scam Middle East. Gladly I never seen this car in Dubai. It’s so garbage and no one wanna be unique with this trash.
Ahhhh here in Canada we use KM/H too there Doug...
Looks like it was ordered by some ultra luxury hotel as a limo in the UAE or Saudi
Interior is ok.  The outside is just fck'n Ugly!   Probably not worth over $200,000. 🙄🙄
The way this velcro part on the umbrella’s handle is closed triggers my ocd
That moment when you realize your $1M Lagonda Taraf is powered by two Ford Taurus Duratec V6s put together....😬🙄😁  Yes, this car is "exclusive", but it is exclusively a rip off too. It feels impeccable and yet like a kit car simultaneously. While it has "presence", it will never cause a Phantom to bow...
The tech and infotainment looks cheap...
I wish every car manufacturer would go back to analog gouges
Actually the most luxurious Aston Martin saloon/ sedan is a Ford Mondeo
Doug after 10 years, Here's why the Austin Martin lagonda has lost its value over the years 😂
The front side view of lagonda looks like Honda Civic Old model.
Looks like genesis instead of proper luxury brand lol
Most expensive luxuxry car and they made the front 3/4 look like a fucking Ford Mondeo. Fair enough
Why did I already know that it was for Saudi princes
@12:10 the handle is aluminum AND magnetic. Wow, those are some engineers they have at Aston Marin!
This car is not worth the extreeeeeeeem prise
the front looks like a genesis
Million dollar vehicle without soft door closing :)
Thissssssss
16:50 beautiful Doug demuro laugh
Please do new escalade
He starts the review by saying that car is Beautiful? I fucking give up and I’m unsubscribing from the channel! Either he’s getting paid off or High but nothing says beautiful about this muted design! And it’s overpriced! I could get two Benleys, a Mercedes, Mclaren and a Porsche and they could all be 2020 and still have a couple hundred thousand dollars in change. You lost a fan with this bs review Doug.
Doug would roast a $50k BMW for having keyholes on the door, a ford turn signal and iPad holders.  I guess once you hit a certain dollar figure, these become “elegant”.
27:43 that answer tho
*a million dollar scam*
So I think this car is truly beautiful, and all the haters sayin it’s ugly r probably angry cause of the price. But 500+ ps for 1mio.? Seriously?? I was expecting like a thousand or something and a acceleration as a super car. This is money waste. But not for the design more for the car itself.
It's ugly!
Who else heard the clunky sound when Doug makes a turn? 🤔
I can think of a million reasons why I wouldn't buy this car. #1 it's not the most beautiful car on the road.
The Rapid looks so much better than this car.
That's the most pathetic excuse of a 1 million dollar car I've ever seen. I could go and buy and Audi S6 right now for less than 100k brand new and it would shit on that in literally every category or better yet just the previous gen used for half the price with a twin turbo V8 that would still shit all over this for less than 50k. You've got to have no shame talking up that pathetic excuse of a car and acting like it's literally anything other than Aston Martin trying to get some money from idiots who clearly have no concept of cars or money.
I think people in the comments behave like they are in the market for million dollar cars. People anything over $100,000, you are buying styling, design, uniqueness, exclusivity and curve side appeal. Sunroof? That creates noise and ruins interior climate. Being cocooned in leather is more important than a sunroof.   But joking aside, this is such a stunning looking car. It is everything one searching for exclusivity would want.   If you have a 1M to blow... this far blows the Phantom out of the water.
such an outdated interior (technology) for such a high price. especially from 2018? WTF
The steering wheel sucks.
This is a $300,000 car at MOST.
so you pay 1 million for the car and it demands YOU to put tablets at the back seats...
looks like a ford mondeo on steroids     for 1 million dollar
You must be really stupid for buying this crap or the "zagato"
Doug: Complaining in high-pitched voice about Porsche fanatics bragging about the stitching.  Also Doug: Minutes of talking stitching and patterns in a weird-looking overpriced Aston Martin with speakers that look like cup holders :-) I really like a lot of Aston Martins and I love Doug's take on cars but I can't get myself to like a generic looking 1million dollar Aston. :-*
Waiting for koenigsegg gemera. And buggati divon thanks
dude u cant even tell the meaning of beautiful lol dumbest and GAY est reviewer in california lol
doug the type of guy to plug his nose when jumping in the water
The most beautyful 4 door sedan ever is Masserati Quattroporte.
Why does he not use the word the. Its in the back not in back
It's so ugly it's not Aston martini
Looks like a 1.2m ford fusion lol.
Still it’s refreshing to see this rarity in here. Doug definitely rules
Lagonda is Aston's Maybach: they don't know what to do with it either.  That Mazda6 fascia...
I think Aston made these thinking they can make a quick buck from the billionaire Arabs who want to spend on anything that's expensive. Those wheels make it look cheap!
Ugly
IMO,the rapids is sexier better looking car that costs ho so much less.why would anybody in his right mind will take this over 2(!) amazing Phantoms?!
$1.000.000!? Bhahahaha! That's funny.
Lagonda doesn't mean anything in Arabic
This is a crappy car.
It so looks different from the other Astons
Crazy to think there are people who consider that Aston Martin isn't luxurious enough for them Even a corolla is luxurious for me
If the badge said Kia and it was $60k you wouldn't give it a second look.  BTW... it looks like a Kia.
Looks like a Nissan
Doug... get your eyes tested. "Most Beautiful".
Imagine paying a million dollars for a horrendously outdated car with nice styling, plastic ford indicator stalks
It's a struggle/hustle car's are the reason I wake up everyday and I got laid off from my job and now I can no longer afford my WRX and probably will have to sell it 😭😭
S class maybach brabus 900 more good from the aston mrtinand more cheaper
Cars&Bids Why only 80's, 90's and modern? Why not older ?
Doug.. don't you think if this car is particularly made for middle east then instead heated seats they should have provided cooled seats??
Looks like Aston Martin took some styling cues from GTA. And......a million for this, I'm speechless
That's a lot of beautiful for one car.
The key has a Russian Certification Compliance logo 👀
this car is ugly as hell.
I've seen maybach's sell for over 1 mil.
This might be a weird request but I’ve always been curious about what the sound systems are like in the cars you review. Maybe you could have a certain song you play for every car to easily compare them
1 min silence for those people who had purchased this "stereotypical" luxury sedan! They got fooled by Aston Martin. Better buy Lamborghini huracan or E63 amg
No sound test? :(
this is such a great content
one of the only times i've disagreed with Doug. Not beautiful.
What a piece of crap!
One of the worst videos you ever made. But it's a great bottom line....
the wheel's don't fit this gorgeous car
PAID REVIEW.
1mil and no sunroof? i would rather buy 2 rolls royce than this.
I think Doug gets a nice salary for this video. This car is not the most beautiful sedan and it is not really special, its only absolute overpriced
I'm mostly certain that the only major difference between the Rapide and the Taraf is that UMBRELLA 🌂
I can't see why ANYONE would buy this instead of a Rolls. 1 million dollar and uses ANYTHING From a Rapide? From a Ford Focus? Jesus fuckin Christ
Could this be a 4D chess troll satire piece? This is as generic of a sedan shape as a 80s volvo or a mutilated 2012 Ford. It has roughly same room for back passengers as a Camry.    A distinct grill? You couldn't have a more generic grill than that. All of the car's mechanics are just shlepped together from other cars and it's not a great performance car either, nor does it have the "land yacht" drive quality of a Rolls Royce or a Maybach. It's just a random money sink, made of people that are willing to exchange their blob of money for something that few people have.
So.. in the front is Honda Accord?
Buyer: "How much does it cost?... Aston Martin;  ..."Yes"
Totally overpriced.
O'Gara exists Doug: Yes
I literally repeat after him ...This is ...😂
Nothing special about this car...just to say the least. BMW 760Li is a century ahead in every aspect. No comparisons whatsoever
I think we'd like more Alfa Romeo reviews like 155 s, 159, mito, giulietta etc.
I don't see what's cool 😎 about this car, if I had a million dollars I wouldn't buy it
A RR Wraith starts at a million in India 😂
Doug : This is the most beautiful sedan!  *it was today when I realized Doug has terrible taste in sedans*
You will know the truth 📖 and the truth will set you free. Free from the world the flesh and the devil 💀🔥 John 8:32   We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness , and to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17
world's most expensive sedan for not enough reasons
Sorry but this car is just plain ugly..
0:19 definitely looks like a black 10th gen accord
Million dollar luxury sedan from 2018, with an absolute dogshit feature list. That infotainment system is utterly DESTROYED by my $20,000 2016 Civic Coupe. Are people with this much money really so out of touch with reality that they're convinced this actually has value? Utterly ridiculous lmao
Looks like my ford mandeo without glass on side panel between doors
This car is trash.
Am I the only one that cringed Everytime he called the amber turn signals “orange”? How tf are you a car guy and call amber turn signals orange? Wtf
I'm suuuuuuuuper Happy! But not because of this review! It's because of the next one! Lamborghini Centenario roadster!
Please tell me they didnt wrap the car, althought if it this matt black is factory paint, it is even more concerning. i mean for that retardiculous amount of money one could expect a decent paintjob at least.
What an ugly car... btw NOBODY here in England, drives this car... NOBODY
Well, arabs are rich, so they price it too high, it's not actually worth it.
I think Koenigsegg Gemera is a more expensive sedan🤔
One more question, have you ever been pulled over while doing a review/ test drive and could you share a story about it on more Doug?
Can you please review the new ram Trx
This might be a weird question but do you ever get nervous leaning on the cars you review? I’m assuming most of them have a clear coat protection layer just wondering I always worry somehow I’d scratch my car with a jean button or something
Can’t believe how bad the infotainment/navigation is in that car for $1,000,000...
1 mil dollar car and you got that exposed door lock.
cannot unsee the L shape joining the rear bumper cover after pointed out in an article somewhere - this vehicle has it too :)
Your translation is correct, but your Pronunciation is wrong for taraf…!!! The way you should pronounce taraf is as if you’re saying it ta-rough and it’s written in Arabic like this تَرَفْ , thank you for your awesome video as all your videos, and the beautiful presentations, am extensively following your channel from Kuwait, but am not a Kuwaiti, cheers Bro. And keep up the good work
Succckkkkssss
So this car is $1 million dollar’s and it uses 2 Ford Duratec 3.0 V6 engines put together pretty much 😂😭😅🤣
120 built? They have enough parts for these when they break in a couple of years with about 5,000 to 10,000 miles on them?
I can’t be the only one who find this super beautiful
Did this guy just say the aluminum is magnetized😂
could you put a towbar on this car???
i like the car, but even if i had a trillion  dollars.... ill never pay 1m for that... maybe 300k max
Pathetic design nd price
How annoying is the American accent
It's a million dollar ford fusion
10:03 "It will stay exactly there" Well, it didn't
That rarity didnt help the delorean😂 Ill pass.
What the fucc is this lol
Aston Business guy: "How do we make up for all the money we lost on the Rapide?"  Aston Marketing guy: "I present to you... Rapide for $1m"
The Citroen DS is still the best looking sedan!
It's ugly!!!!
The windows made to go down inches when doors being opened without thinking about the water when it rains because rain is rare in the Middle-East. Just my random thought.
BMW 7 V12 IS MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL. L.AGONDA IS JUST RARE. WHAT MAKES DOUG IMPRESSED, BROWN COLORED INTERIOR IS AWFUL.
Please review the Centenario
It looks like a Hyundai Genesis 💀
I don’t see 1 million in this thing...
I like the 1987 Lagonda so much better.
Rather have a Phantom...
The outside of the car looks like a 2020-2021 model lol.! Inside looks super out dated
Straight up looks like a car from GTA V
Doug sounds like he works for Ogara.
This is Lagonda taraf  Taraf, Taraf, Lagonda Taraf, Taraf  Doug said it 527 times in 30min🤭
It’s like when Doug advertiser his website cars and bids it going to be the next car that is going to upload in the next video
I've missed Doug reviewing very exotic cars.🚗🚘
i think its ugly :/
Please review Jeep Liberty 2011
The car can bring your deliveries to you 15 minutes ago
pretty lengthy isn't it
I haven't even seen the video but I already love this. What a car this is, I love how it looks
Jag XJ was better looking when it came out 8 years ago
Noone with an actual common sense would buy garbage.
doug is the type of guy to have bad posture
"Other Aston-Martins of this era."  Dude it's only two years old.
I keep thinking of the new Honda Accord on the front of this thing. Pls end me
Who’s really dumb enough to buy this over a Tesla?
Dude I just saw that in Toronto today. I was like yo thats some good paint on that car
It’s literally a Rapide LIMITED EDITION  🤷‍♂️
Million-dollar for a Ford focus look smh
I am super unimpressed
The panel gap between the interior door panel and the B pillar could give the Ghibli a run for its money. A million bucks apparently doesn't buy an extra inch of door panel.
Thanks but I’ll take a phantom...
The front almost looks like a ford fusion lol
I’d be very disappointed if I had spent a million dollars on this. A long wheel base Mercedes S class does a better job of cosseting you in luxury at a fraction of the price. That infotainment — really!
I’ve got a pretty good idea why it was only sold in the Middle East........because nobody else in the rest of the world is stupid enough to spend a million on an outdated car like this. This is more for the collectors who have like a 100 or more cars.  Set aside outside styling and even an 2003 Mercedes S600 is better in every way, that’s 15 years difference
Tbh!!!I think it looks ugly
13:25 the stitching on the belt buckle looks wonky to me.
I don’t get the look of this car. From the side it looks like a Cadillac sixteen. From the back it actually kinda looks like an Aston Martin, but from the front it looks like a Ford Fusion on steroids.
Definitely not worth a million.  Maybe $100000, but barely
Aston Martin: Lagonda Taraf Is the World's Most Expensive Luxury Sedan  Koeniggsegg: Hold my beer........Gemera!!!
I'm sorry, it's just not worth a million dollars.
Damn, Doug is selling out. You can tell this is a sponsored video. Maybe a dealer that cant sell this POS.
Should cost 200k
Doug the type of guy to call you and say “I can’t talk right now”
I’ll stick to my corolla it’s worth a million dollars.....in reliability
Whoa, this video got 1 mil views in less than 2 days
It's just perfect. ....😍
The front end looks like a rich mans Honda Accord 😭
Not bad but... I would like to see one with shiny paint, might improve my opinion. Million dollars, he is right, I don't have it and never will so what is the point, but, don't think it is the most beautiful sedan ever no matter how many times Doug fell over himself to tell us so. I agree with someone else one here, having the money, I'd take 2 Rolls, or a Rolls and a Bentley. They are all excessive, imo.
Is it just me.... Or does this looks like a Ford fusion lol 😅🤣😂👻
YES, you are going to Hell if you dont REPENT and follow the New Testament, the DEVIL LIES, lets not play DUMB
I like it. Grille looks like a mazda cx5 grile tho haha
Just me this car looks like your typical KIA?
Very offensive to middle east people. RR Phantom any day
Doug Demuro the type of guy who Rev matches when changing gears on a bicycle.
So it is a 1 million dollar Rapide for the Middle East without any interesting feature we haven’t seen before... idiots
He had my attention when he said it cost 1million dollars 💵😏
That car is beautiful but I think the Rolls Royce Phantom has a better luxury experience and does a better overall job. This just isn’t worth the price.
I'm here to give the testimony on how Dr Lady Valary  help me bring my husband back when a lady took him from me because I was unable to bear him a child and a friend of mine introduce me to Dr Lady Valary who helped me with a spell for fruitfulness and after a month I took in and my husband came back to me .I have tried Dr Lady Valary in many ways with friends and family problem and he is very great in what he does,he can help in the following, *Marriage spell *Love spell *Good luck spell *Promotion spell *lottery's spell *cleansing/removal of bad energy  *Home cleansing and banishing evil spirits  *palm/tarot card reading  *Ritual and money spell *protection spell *pregnancy spell *Voodoos  spell And more Contact me via Whats-app (+971529615981)
only thing more than the price they paid Doug for this review is the price you'll pay for the car.
Imagine doug checking the fakevent of the car using the Carwow stick of truth
This car is the greatest at doing absolutely nothing except being a million dollars!! Can the people who bought this get a moment of silence??
Looks like an over sized Mondeo from the front.
Uhhh did u had to say terrible 😕
Million dollar for aston martin sedan?  wtf
Dodge Charger DB9
Imagine breaking the signal stalk on your Lagonda Taraf and buying a new one at autozone
Bentley Flying Spur. Less than half the price. The Lagonda is expensive at $500k. A million bucks is taking the piss. Selling to vain arabs with more money than sense. As for most beautiful sedan. Really. Well as they say, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.
Panamera is better
It's a Dodge Challenger with the curves/contours of an AMG Mercedes
Doug Needs A Real Haircut And A Real Review On This Car. 🤖
That child seat anchor emblem showing a child in a seat attached an anchor was hilarious!
doug the type of guy to be trending
The costs for making an analog speedometer maybe higher than a digital one, so AM keep using it as a luxury equipment.
Next year: "Here's why the Taraf lost $800.000 in value"
That is one expensive Genesis!
You're paying for the carbon fiber body... an essential characteristic of this car!
Make show auston martin have my future car for me an it's name rodricik martin 🇻🇨🔥🔥💯♦️♦️♦️
Lmao from front it looks like new Hyundai Elantra.
Colombianos 🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
Should be renamed the C.O.O.A, Car of old Arabs
Why is no one talking about the centanario
A luxury division of a luxury car company..hmmmm 🙄
Cars 'from this era' ... lol isn't this only like 2 yrs old?
$1 000 000 Ford Fusion.
AM greased Doug’s palm? Obviously trying to take a run at Rolls and Bentley. This exaggerated review is as ridiculous as this car’s price and damages Doug’s credibility.
The headlights remind me too much of a new Honda Accord lmao
0:00 THISSSS
Grill looks like a Taurus
Wow, the turn signals work. How luxurious. You absolute shill
That thing got hit with the "ugly as hell stick"
I'm gonna be the Devil's advocate and speak my mind. This car is plain looking and ugly. It should cost around $80,000.
Cmon Doug how much did AM throw you for this review 😂
Make a review of a superlite SLC please
Not worth a million dollar
An Aston Martin luxury brand - when Aston Martin is not luxurious enough
What is laganda u ask? Laganda is a very dangerous desease. laganda -  - - - - - - - laganda ma balls son
1M view in 1 day. Man you are really making 💵💵💵
That rpm gauge hurt my brain with it going the wrong way
10:03  FAIL!!!
1st copy aston martin 🤣
Indians will go mad for it!  $ 1 Million and not a single sunroof!!  😱😱😱😱
Doug, this review is a big dissapoitment. This car only has high quality leather and stiching for a 1mn USD car (with beautiful design).
Remember that Chevrolet SS you did a review on and botched it all up? Yea, well that's what I own, bought brand new for under 50K and it can do the same thing and it is very very rare with a 6spd manual and magnetic ride control. They are holding their value quite well maybe better than most other cars. THIS car has just as much chrome and my HOOD VENTS ARE REAL in which was ONE thing you got wrong.  Thanks but no thanks.
why buy this when i can buy 12.5 tesla model X
This looks $1Mn Honda
As much as I’d like to watch this video of the Lagonda ________. I simply cannot, Doug. Have you ever listened to your final product before posting? I STRONGLY suggest you do, or more so. Perhaps you’ve normalized your voice in your mind, in which case you can try listening to the entire video with your eyes closed (Keep a bucket close to you).  If you don’t have schizophrenia to explain the difference in your voices, I suggest you stop attempting to be all the bizarre characters in your changing voices. You seem to have a habit of switching between someone that adds syllables to words that have less syllables, then enunciating extras one, using something like a multi-tone but only in a single syllable that sometimes extends to your face. I don’t know what this is, but it is not some form of an accent. This is not someone’s speaking habits you’ve adopted. But IT IS really weird and I might venture to say it’s a cross between an over-excited circus-master and a serial killer. PLEASE! For the love of God, STOP. If you want to do this seriously, get a voice coach. But, don’t do nothing.  At times, you demonstrate you are capable of speaking in other manners that would be perceived as a healthy human who is passionate about automobiles. Unfortunately that person (manner or tone) appears far too infrequently and gets lost among the other “people” that speak about the interestingly crafted and unique voitures that you destroy with your voice, and continue to do so, in this case, for 7-seconds short of 30-minutes! It’s agonizing and why I needed to stop this audio-pinball when my hands began to hurt. Hands? I realized I was white-knuckling my phone, in attempt to listen longer, but I couldn’t from the various pain I felt as I tried to negate the feelings but I couldn’t any longer, as I look now, at the 11:57 mark that would have been plenty long given that an episode of Car and Driver (or the like) runs 30 minutes with commercials, meaning 22minutes of content for them to review about 3 cars and something extra. As I see now, you have 10k comments on a 1-day piece. One million views, 3.69 million subscribers, you must be doing something right.   Now imagine you spoke a little better, you might find even more opportunities knocking on your car door? Good luck to you. You’ve built something very admirable. Consider the next steps. Growing bigger, becoming more popular, what does it take... If you don’t know these answers, I’m sure Google knows. But one thing will definitely be working on your voice, management, and talent agent but not in that order.. ✌️Peace, bruh
If i got a dollar for every time Doug said lagonda or taraf, i might be able to buy this car
I like the stitching, very pleasant to look at.  Everything else does not sum to $1 mill.
The headlights kinda remind me of an 08 Acura TL lol
The only way that hideous crate could be worth $1 million is if it had $975,000 in the trunk....
Meh, at first glance thought it was a Volvo.
I know 2018 was in The Before Times, but saying "at the time" makes it seem like you think it was in the way back when.
Doug: *as you can see there is a drink cooler in this little compartment*  Me: *slowly puts soda in it*
A 1 million car with 2003 displays & centre console from the DB9
Million dollar car... 700k for the name badge.  Sorry, the Royce is still the better buy for your buck
This is the first time I've really disagreed with a DougScore. It's clearly a good system. This car games the system because it's too Doug for Doug to be realistic about it... And that's okay. It's an interesting car, but drop that value score to a 2 and the styling to an 8. Maybe re-examine the practicality, too. That trunk opening is a joke. Cargo capacity is average, but how do you get anything in there bigger than a backpack?
not sure if it is worth 1 million dollars. beautiful though but to me not so special
Million dollars car, free sweat devalued the car by $999,999. Keep saying that he doesn’t have any respect for other people shit.
It doesn’t even have a sunroof... It look like a 97 Cadillac STS... even the STS back then had a sunroof...
for that price tag it better come with a tax evasion mode
use 1 million dollars to buy 5 Aston martin Rapide S . interior look the same, ext is different
ayy you made trending
This car looks like a glorified Dodge Charger
Overpriced...for essentially Aston Martin LWB Rapide. For that money, could’ve taken Rapide chassis and went to Zagato for more beautiful bodywork
Really Doug the best looking sedan, It looks cheap AF no soft closing doors no luxury no appeals nothing for 1 million dollars really? How come you are not LYAO in this video 🤔 I don't even wonder why they sell it far away from people with a brain who will recognize BS.
Look how much times doug said distinctive
YouTube stop with the double non skip able ads
All features of this car is same as a Aston Martin rapide s .... so better to buy rapide instead of lagonda 😕😕😕
This is NOT a beautiful sedan. A Jaguar XJ series III is a beautiful sedan.
there is something so gorgeously ugly about this car when you look at the exterior
Front of the $1M car looks like Ford Fusion with Honda accords headlights🤔
My thought : "this has to be the ugliest car I've ever seen". Doug  : "this is the most beautiful Sedan ...". I've never once had a disagreement with his style preference. Something is off. Cool car sorta but not really.
This is the best rip-off.  What is Arabic for idiot? This is this.  For a million Dollars they should not use common Ford stuff.  The beaty is not enough to justify that price.  Sneer at the commoner in the Rolls while flicking the Ford indicator switch.   I am somewhat disappointed with your review Doug. This feels like a sell out review.  You would usually mock common things but here you excuse it.
And?
Aston Martin a luxury sports car automaker has a luxury car brand...
I got to sit in and go around a silver/gold Lagonda that was on display at Galpin Aston Martin (when I worked there) back in 2015, and I was blown away!
This car doesn't have rear cooled seats?! That a rapide has?!
I know Aston Martin is having trouble selling this lmao
You like the European cars. Look like a Honda Accord or Ford Focus.
Looks like a 2020 concept car from 2010..a bad 2020 concept car
Nobody: Doug: THHHHHHHIIIIISSSSSSSSSS
Starts at 3:30
Every time I watch a Doug DeMuro video I go to carsandbids.com just to look at more cars.
This is a pimp my ride car for Arabs. Ludicrous.
$1 million and it has no sunroof lmaooooo
Doug is in love. But I wouldn’t pay more than a phantoms price for it.
OMG HES DOING A CENTENARIO REVIEW
The rear end is ugly. Looks like it was chopped off.
I’d take a 7 series over this lol, this car is trying too hard to be sexy and it’s not :/
this car is not worth 1 million dollars lol
I'm sorry....that car is ugly. V12 and only 500+hp. I get that it's luxury and it's 2018 fast but, nah. Not even if I had a million to burn.
That car is literally disgusting on the inside. There are KIA’s of the same era that are designed so much more
Honda Accord?
A quick Google search and I found out that Taraf means party, not whatever you said.
Way to over priced not worth 1mil maybe 300k
1 Million dollars for Honda Accord looking car , better go with Accord
I wouldn't pay over 150k for this rolls royce has FAR nicer cars with nicer headliners (like the one with stars) has actual screens n such, not wack ass ipads lol
Not worth 1 milli. At all.
Doug was abducted and forced do this by Aston Martin's goons
Anyone have USB charging cable for my NOKIA 3310 after that I will shift to this car
If you're not in love with this car's styling, you failed at the class. Please go back to car school.
Other than a fridge and a foot and a half in length, it is on the same level of luxury as the Rapide S which is $750K less.  Literally every feature Doug mentioned is in the Rapide S.
If this car is worth a million dollars then my shit is worth 10 thousand dollars
LUXXXXXURY
13:30 Do middle eastern countries really enforce regulations like that when they could have showy luxury instead?
There's a funny moment between 9:56 and 10:04. Doug says the car door will stay open "precisely where you want" and it basically proceeds to start closing on him at one point before he catches it.
Sugonda?
Sorry Doug, this is not a great looking car, sorta ugly on the outside. Paint job seems poor (granted it may be the lighting that makes it look bad, like it has a wrap on it). The inside is beautiful, mighty fine. If you are a bedouin prince with endless oil money then this is the car for you. But there are other more beautiful, tasteful cars to pick from.
https://youtu.be/h5RmrdrEh4o 누가 이단인가!!!- 전염병 취급 당하고 고소당한 나사렛 이단의 괴수 vs 유대인!!
A million? That’s like saying Amy Schumer is funny
The fact that Doug is just a year older than Taylor swift really won’t sink in for me
Aka worst way to spend $1million
Trump 2020 , Make democrats cry again, nice car !
so no soft close doors for a million?
Doug talks about 2018 like it was 20 years ago.
Imagine having a flat black Taraf in the Arab deserts. The thing is going to heat up to 200 degrees Fahrenheit.
how the hell is this 1 million dollars lol
Honestly... I better buy 2015 S-Class that looks more credible, luxurious, and has more options inside. Fuck that LaGoNdA Taraf  Edit: It's 2020, but Aston still uses their old ass dashboard. Why they, at least, couldn't put the new one instead, like in DB11?
8:31  there's no such a word existed in Arabic called " Lagonda"
This a 1 million dollar car and they have a small pixellated screen in the gauge cluster. This was a car put together from scraps of other cars slapped with a Lagonda logo to ramp up the price
Fun drinking game; Drink a shot every time he says Lagonda or Taraf
Of coarse this car isn't worth what it was sold for! The way I see it this car was only conceived for the top 1% in a part of the world famous not just for over the top bespoke supercars etc.... but for abandoning and neglecting them. This car is for the person so weathly that cost is just braging rights, doesn't matter what you got for that million, simply that you spent it. If there's a market for a $100,000 a night hotel room theres market for this car. The sultan of brunei has a literal fleet of Ferrari enoz's and more than likely more than one of these. They where only gonna build 100 of them and ultimately built 120. Good on Aston Martin haha
This is essentially a cash-in from Aston Martin. Based on a decade-old vehicle and using existing inventory to create something 'new' for a niche high-end market that should know better. Gorgeous car, but $1 million? Come on, AM, you shysters.
funny how he calls 2018 an "era" as if it were many many years ago 😂
Doug are you OK?.... You looks fat and if you have something under your clothes (like a urine bag)
Nah it just an overpriced 10th gen accord on body stretch.
It looks like a Volkswagen.
Interesting cost saving on the brake disk. Instead of producing left and right side spirals for cooling, they use the same ones on each side - meaning they run backwards on the US passenger side of the car 🤔
This car seems overall pretty wack for a million dollars...
I honestly like my Acura TLX more than this car...
Do you like luxury?
Was that a Lamborghini Centenario in the cars and bids ad part or am I going crazy?? I was freaking out
Aston Martin: Let's make a car that will cost us about $100,000 to make and sell it for $1,000,000 to Middle Easterners with too much money. Dealer in LA: I MUST HAVE THIS ABOMINATION!
The what the heck in this vid is actually the Lamborghini in the cars and bids ad
Good on Aston Martin for ripping off the richest idiots in society I suppose
1m dollar sedan with Honda accord head lights much ugly looks like chevy head unit loll
Ashton should stick to producing those super cars
It looks like a Honda Accord
Front end looks kinda like a Honda Accord?
looks like a ford fusion
okay Im sorry guys, but like I tried to like it, but naaaaaaaah, this shit is ugly yo
It looks like a Chinese copie of Aston  martin 🤣🤣
2020 mazda 3 Looks better than this on the outside
It looks like an extended Ford Fusion.
TARRAFFFFFFFF
I don't think you mentioned the fact that the whole body is made of Carbon Fibre which is how they saved on weight. That's why the Rapid isn't much difference in weight. Even though the Lagonda is much of a larger auto.
Those seats better be heated and cooled with a happy ending feature for a million!
Soo.... it's not a ford fusion?
This car actually brought Daddy Doug to his knees
Not enough nice for million
Honda Accord
If I could review the Taraf with Doug DeMuros I would pack up the Hash Pipe with Rocky and get all schmoked up.
This car proves there's no excuse for not having amber rear indicator lights.
PETERSENNNNNN
$1M Ford Fusion
Ford Fusion On Steroids
It looks nice but not 1mill nice
Honestly the front end looks like a 2019 Honda Accord....
The body lines are so simple that it gives the car no soul and the roof line is plain ugly IMO. Anyone can draw this thing up if they know anything about car design. That matte black paint isn't doing it any wonders either. I definitely wouldn't give this a 10/10 in design
This is one gorgeous sedan. No doubt about it. Although the body style, the grill, reminds me of a Genesis, Even the Lagonda badge reminds me of a Genesis. The Lagonda's  interior is amazing.
1,000,000 🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾🤦🏾.  Maybe 500,000 lol
He said "head turning", at 24:45 there was a ford ranger with 2 guys next to him & they never even noticed it. I guarantee if that was a Rolls Royce or a Bentley, they would have took a look. Its not nowhere near as beautiful or headturning or special as he is trying to make it seem. Just bc the middle east wants it doesn't mean its the best.
Fun fact: Everyone else including me who is commenting right now hasn't even watched half the video yet.

the front looks like a honda civic
doesnt even have a sunroof
this car sucks i would never waste my money on that]
I think they forgot the clear coat on that paint job.
I can't be the only one that thinks this car looks really ugly...
So off base, it almost seems like he's either trolling us or shilling someone else. Unsubbed.
looks like a charger rear end tailights without the connection middle part lol
It is without a doubt a beautiful car on the outside. But the interior is outdated from the start. Mercedes-Benz S class introduced mercedes new digital cockpit in 2015 for example. The Lagondas infotainment looks like i should be in car from mid 2000. And there is no cooling or massage in the back. I mean for 1 million dollars it is kind of cheap. And why even bother with heated seats in car designed for the middle east?   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=di7zR46kJSs
A million dollar car you can’t get road head in. 👎
NO CAR should cost 1 million dollars. But if something does it is definitely not this one. Immensely overpriced
I would definitely get a benz s550 over this particular Aston Martin
Kinda looks like the 2021 Genesis G90
Next video of my all time fav Lamborghini centenario convertible
👍
This is a bad joke. Mazda’s look better than this. Remember, this is a glorified Ford- and a fugly one at that
I thought this was only in Dubai, and I assumed you were on vacation. 😄
Am I the only one that sees a  modern-day Lincoln Zephyr?
Looks like a distinctive ford fusion
10:03 ah the door will stay exactly there.. until it doesn't
Doug, we need old school Mitsubishi! Can you find both a FTO and Lancer? Tanks!
He trippin every 4door genesis looks better than this
Good looking. But the rims are ugly as fuck. My Hyundai i30n has better looking wheels.
if thats a kia brand. its not even worth $100k
stop saying lagonda taraf
You said the car is in km/h because it wasn't sold in North America, but here, your neighbours up north, we use km/h
When are you going to put more creativity in your titles😂
that car is a shit rip off i would rather have a rolls phantom and cullinan
Looks like the Honda Accord and the Ford Fusion had a baby and it was later raised by an S-Class with a long wheelbase.
UGLY!!! Fortunately for Aston Martin, there will always be some very rich and stupid people who will buy it just to differentiate themselves from the rest of the population !
I was literally thinking that the headlights looked similar to the Ford Taurus. When he actually mentioned Ford Taurus I got a little freaked haha
Definitely overpriced lol. Phantom is better
Thought the Rapide was their only ongoing, well was ongoing sedan. I knew that one was out prior but thought production stopped. 🤔
Aston Martin: We will make the Lagonda only for the Middle East market! Also Aston Martin: Puts heated seats and no cooling for them...
Doug stole the ash tray and umbrella
😂So all what I get from this million bucks Aston Martin GIRAFFE is an old school GPS and turn signal handle wow And an umbrella in middle of the trunk  And there is No sun/moon panoramic roof but I get instead a tiny fridge for water bottles that wasting half of the trunk space like the umbrella thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also we all not forgotten about that famous fuel door now it’s made cap less instead of the a fuel door on each side on the old model of this wired ass car
23:50 ....I’m assuming the windshield wiper fluid reservoir cap is from Ford Focus as well? Or it’s just the universal one from EBay?
This car ain’t worth a million dollars
really rare and interesting
One thing that does not match the luxury and elegance of the Taraf, is unshaved Doug in shorts and a T-shirt :D .
It looks like it’s chocking the kid with an anchor in that silver button for a child safety seat!

No mention of the fugly keyhole next to the front door handle?!?!
8:43 Doug on his knees is taller than the car. What the heck...
Me: what is leganda? Aston:when Uganda's makes luxury cars yea thats leganda
"a very distinctive grill"  Except for the Honda Accord, which I briefly mistakened  it for.
I cant help to unsee Dougs hair on the back of his head being highlighted most of the video....
Like the leather but the car itself looks like something from 10 years ago. I think its only selling for 1m because they are selling it in the middle east where 1m dollars is chump change. It most definitely is not worth 1m dollars outside of Dubai.
If the handle on the B pillar is aluminum (aluminium) than how is it magnetized?
The only reason why he's hyping up this overpriced piece of junk his because he's a big fan of the brand $1000000 and it has the same screen in the back seats in my 2006 Cadillac DTS has million dollars and it doesn't even have cooled seats in the back doesn't have automatic sun shades what the heck are you paying for?
That's an OK looking ford. For 80K it seems like a great deal. Oh wait, a million? Not in a million years.
i speak arabic
How does the saying go? “A fool and his money are soon parted”?
That interior is ridiculous
Definitely a video I thought I’d never see, this is amazing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcbjVLvapKE
For a million dollars the front end looks like a cross between a new Hyundai Genesis and a Ford Mustang, and the back end looks like a dodge Challenger
Yeah, I’m sure a $1million car that looks like that will hold its value really well.
From everything you critiqued. This car is not worth more than a S-Klasse, or an BMW 7 Series. It certainly isn't worth a Milli. No matter the exclusivity of the brand itself. Or, "the rarity, the speciality." You can't explain that away. If you want this vehicle, and can afford it, you'll  buy it. The saving grace is its exclusivity. But, there are better choices for much less. They give you more, caché, panache, exuberance, branding, performance, and value.  It is a beautiful execution of an advanced (from Aston Martin) "stately" sedan. Really.
Doug was overselling the mess out of this car. Talking about its the best looking car he's ever seen. It looks my 2017 Ford fusion but stretched out 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Not worth it
Love Aston Martin Cars! Look’s like the next James Bond car or choice!
Baseball Glove interior blah.
Phil Jeffries, good Italian name.
Want exclusive European car in America.  No problem.  I own politicians.
Doug is the type of guy that let other men discipline his kids
I would like of interior if color was a Red winne. This color stayed much homogeny. Should to have more Black details.
I agree with Doug, it is a stunning car. It is probably the most beautiful car Aston have ever made. Only slight gripe for me is the underwhelming interior. If they could make half a dozen unique dashboards for the DB10, they could have done something for 100'ish of these.
Rather have a maybach that has all of the same luxury features, more legroom, more comfort, and is 1/5 of the price
Nice but not for a million dollars
I don't think it'll ever be a 50 grand car, but I don't think it'll hold its value at all.
Hanging out at Peterson’s, huh?
Never heard of this until now. I disagree about it being beautiful though, I don't think it looks good from any angle, it just looks awkward and out of proportion. Also I like to think the last thing the previous owner was listening to was Alan Brazil's breakfast show on talkSPORT.
Wow!!! That’s an expensive  Genesis G90!
Taraf in Arabic means extremely luxurious
looks like an audi
Still tuned to talkSPORT...
I’m an arab and the name doesn’t make sense
This car is a joke. It's like putting the designs of economic sedans together plus a big engine. A lot of 60k cars look better, feel better and have more functions.
Looks like a Genesis...
Doug you should review the SLR Stirling Moss.
This car should’ve been sold in Europe/NA more and should’ve had a waaaaaaaay lower price (350k)
Fusion sport
Car for arabic market.  Has wine bottle cooler.
The front looks like a fiat tipo  😂
Won’t even pay $100000 for this crap
Looks Are subjective but no way this is the most beautiful 4 door sedan, I mean even the rapide has this beat in style terms
isn't this door staying when open trick  common in cheaper  cars as well? the suzuki that u reviewed earlier has these doors. the design reminds me of hyundai accent.
omg for the first time in my life I see a car I never knew about before, which was in existence for some time, obviously not to be, nor project car or a concept car or something either, do u know I mean...
Buyers only in the Middle East.. "That Arab 💰 🎶" 💃 🛢
Hey, does this Taraf cost a million dollars?
Great Video Doug, I really get the impression you enjoyed making this video. Thanks for putting the metric figures up again,  saves me pausing and looking it up on Google.
I think Doug forgot about the 1967 Chevy Impala Sport Sedan’s (four door) body lines if he loves body lines so much THAT car definitely suits his taste. That Impala is the best looking 4 door to me.
The front end looks like a Chrysler 200.
Very luxurious for a 2010 car....
Are we in the year 2040 or some were in that era? It sure sounds like that when you say :from this era. When talking about a 2018 model. But I se what you did there Doug 😉 and it kinda makes you a preppper.
You made it Doug. I think you don't need to load your videos with a bunch of ads. Two is enough.
THHHHHISSSSSSS...
Laganda forever 🙅‍♂️
This car is for idiots with too much money
Doug great review...I would have like to see some shots of the front, side and rear of the car from a distance...get an idea of the lines and proportions.
Just saying cars and bids is amazing I bought a jaguar XJR and it was outstanding. Thanks Doug
Lol a Honda Accord looks better than that car 😂
"Aston Martin's luxury brand." Because normal Aston Martin isn't luxury enough.
10 for styling?  Front end looks like a ford fusion. Get some sleep Doug
Curious, did Honda Accord steal that front or AM did?
That Centenario tho
Hahaha your funny with the door not closing...little moment there where the door started to close on it own....god I love your Chanel 😀😀
This is possibly the ugliest car I have ever seen, the Rapide looks a million times better with real Aston Martin styling
definitely not worth a million!
This thing sucks.
Imagine paying $1,000,000 for this
1 million dollars and you still have to open your own door!?!?! 😳
There is one, in México City, please research well.
Thank you Doug ☺️☺️ 1) AM Rapide looks better my opinion  2) MB S-63 AMG looks more high class to me ☺️☺️🙏
Lol. I’ll take a flying spur.
Fingerprints all over that flat black paint.
Well the Arabs will buy it for one reason, its the most expensive luxury sedan nothing else.
The front looks like a dodge dart🥴
Camel saddle interior.
I'd rather buy a phantom and three Suburbans for the same price🤔
Ten times more expensive than a Rapide?!?  Veblen effect - Abnormal market behavior where consumers purchase the higher-priced goods whereas similar low-priced (but not identical) substitutes are available. It is caused either by the belief that higher price means higher quality, or by the desire for conspicuous consumption (to be seen as buying an expensive, prestige item). Named after its discoverer, the US social-critic Thorstein Bunde Veblen (1857-1929).
It looks like a future car for a sci-fi movie made in 1991.
Taraf doesn’t mean anything tho
I’m very disappointed with Doug’s review of this car. I get Aston priced thus far for $1million for whatever reason, and frankly, they might find loyal buyers. But to say this is the most luxurious car, and finest sedan ever, is super sub per and highly underwhelming. This car looks like an accord or ford from the front. I do like the back end and side view from the back, but other than that, it’s just an average car. The interior is basic with nice leader stitching but not as much details as a bentley, s class or rolls. Infotainment is so outdated for a 2 year old car, it also lacks in convenience features. I’ll rather buy a rolls, a nice 2021 Toyota Supra and full downpayment for a house rather than this car.
Am I the only one who thinks this just looks like an overpriced Ford Fusion??
Is this Dan's?  Saw it in the toy box by the bus a while back.
When I saw the Centenario 😳
The exterior looks like a BMW 850 and a Chrysler Sebring had a baby.
Aston Martin has this tendency of charging massive money for cars which are basically build with left over parts in the warehouse. Just make them in small numbers and people stupid enough with huge money will think they bought an art piece. Stupid car stupidly priced.
Doug way too generous with this car. This should be DISSED
This car looks like a BMW 7 series and a rolls royce phantom had an ugly baby.
This is the only 4 sore car with a full carbon fiber body
Auntie Lagonda they got a car named after you 🤣🤣🤣!
I literally thought this was a Lincoln Continental.
I literally laughed with tears in my eyes when he started to praise the styling, it looks ridicilously bad and clumsy, it looks like a terrible render. Absolutely horrible. I mean look at the windows lmao
The S class he just reviewed is more luxurious than this
What a lame excuse for an Aston. And very shocked by Doug for this lame review.  The Vanquish is a truly gorgeous car... This is not even close. WTF was this review... A prank!?
Imagine spending a mil on a brand new whip then having it mistaken for a accord in the front
Ford Fusion for a million bucks
So Doug you're telling me that when you give this car a 10 for styling that it is better looking than a bugatti chiron, a laferrari, and a porsche carrera gt? A 4 door sedan? I would say the Fisker Karma is a better looking sedan than this car.
Only an arab would pay this price for this bullshit thats why they sell it there. A RR is 1000000 times better and cooler than this.
🤮🤢
It still looks like the original Lagonda
If the Ford Focus and Dodge Charger had unprotected sex.
We know two things for certian and that is that Doug is a big car entusiast and that the lagonda taraf is a piece of shit money grab car. To sell out this hard must have hurt, hope the money was worth it Doug. I understand the hustle you need to eat but god damn you must be ashamed of this.
No mfn sunroof... Or moon roof........ No privacy shades for back seat........ He didn't even show us the rear seats lean back like every other 100k plus cars ... No foot rest for back seat....... No picnic tables... Horrible ass mfn car
yuck yuck yuck
I think this car is ugly as hell. xD Dont see where he's seeing the whole beauty
Honey that turn signal isn’t the only thing borrowed from ford; the front end came right off a Ford Fusion and no one can tell me otherwise. Million dollar SHAM.
All the features are tailored for fat Middle Eastern dictators, classic.
0:26 120 you say? I wonder how many drives in Arctic...
Too bad it looks like shit. I'd sooner have an '89 Lagonda, even with all its quirks.
So basically a bit cheaper, older, worse and much slower Koenigsegg Gemera
Does anyone else see a mazda from the front?
Doug - the type of guy who puts vinegar on his french fries.
Sorry but I'll take the Rolls!!
it looks like a ford fusion from the front
Literally 1 % people who are reading..........May you parents live happily healthily for more then 💯 years😇❤️💙❤️🙏😇
So I can get a panoramic sunroof and much better infotainment in a Toyota Camry then this million dollar car lol
Tesla Model 3 has glass B pillars too
Anyone else think it needs some tint? 😅
How is this 1 million dollars?? Its nowhere near worth that much, it should be the price of a rr phantom, in fact much less
Why does a million dollar car look like a Chinese knock off?
This looks like the 2019 Hyundai Elantra
It needs to have 40,000$ pearl paint or perfectly crafted matte finish to look exotic. 1 million isn’t gonna sell itsself
So, in conclusion... They put a bunch of  lagonda badges on an aston martin, changed the looks a bit, made it a limited edition to give it a million dollar price tag. Wow!
If the valie score factors in exclusivity then every car needs to have the same value score. Price is always the outcome of supply and demand, everyone pays what they think is the worth of the vehicle
Looks like Hyundai Genesis
A 2020 Camry fully loaded has more tech than this overpriced POS.
Targeting Middle East customers and having heated seats instead of seat cooling??!! Really??
Doug you better review that centenario
It’s just a remodelled Rappide
Be careful Doug.You don't want to come across a bunch of peaceful protesters in that thing.
One of the most beautiful cars ever made.. In one of the worst colours.. Matt black..dreadful. Whoever ordered that exterior colour has money but no class. A real shame. 😔
This car looks nice and all, but holy crap, it is not worth one million dollars. So overpriced.
The car makers think their target customers are fools. I don’t like the new generation Mercedes S-Class but it looks more luxurious than this. The steering looks cheap, the navigation is SHIT. Leather everywhere doesn’t mean luxury! The exterior shape looks dated.
Most beautiful sedan??? Bruh....
Wow this car is pretty trash for $1MM my A4 has better tech than this junk
Earth has 120, but I just came back from Mars and they have a couple. I was able to test drive it, great car and all but it'll take 6-8 months to ship it to earth so I don't know about the value. I'll give it a value score of 4 out of 10
Doug, it looks like an extended ford fusion...how much is Aston Martin paying you?
I’ll wait 3 years and buy it for 2 grand
It looks like a Accord in the front.
Imagine you are about to buy this car for $1M, you see the umbrella with the Lagonda logo, the ash tray with a Lagonda logo, pretty exclusive, pretty cool... and then you see that turn signal... it seems familiar, ooh yea, the same one from the Focus your gardener drives. No buy.
It looks like a dodge challenger from dacia
Imagine paying a million dollars for a car that doesn't even have a sunroof.
The interior is the cheapest looking interior ever. Mazda's of the time are nicer and richer looking.
Why so many dislikes and butt hurt replies? Its his opinion on the car, everyone's entitled to one.
It's not ugly. But it looks very awkward. It is far from being the prettiest. I would drive it. But the best looking car? Yeah.... sure..
Now, even though this car is not worth it to us. People who are mega rich would probably have 15 other cars (more or less). This would be like pocket change for them.   This car though is still way overpriced and I lost a little respect for Doug. If he personally thinks the car is great good for him. Though if he was paided (which it looks like it) well 🤷‍♂️
Lagonda proves that the Middle East market is the most dumb in the world. It's like an insult from Aston Martin to Arab sheikhs who are ready to pay a million  for a toilet with a Rolls Royce badge, because the neighbor doesn't have one.
Lagonda drivers can scoff all they want at Phantom drivers. Phantom drivers know they got a car 10 times as luxurious for half the price.  Seriously... 4-inch, black-and-white, pixelated screens for a MILLION dollars? In an ultra-luxury car from TWO YEARS AGO?
the value score should be 1 and all other cars on the Doug list should be changed to 10
Cadillac ATS X Ford Mondeo. Business up front, lemon party in the back. Arabs are not the brightest folks, so that design would be enough for them.
Take a shot every time Doug says rapide
Ugly af
Aston Martin/Lagonda: "look we've made the ultimate luxury saloon "  Rolls Royce : " hold my champagne in ice"
2018 car .. and the infotainment system is from 2004
Luxury sedan and red break caliper does not make sense
A phantom or cullinan would be so much better as a luxury car than this
Need some paint correction at 1:29, the scratches and swirl marks 😖😖
Funny you should bring up Ford Taurus... You don't see it?
Why
A sedan isn’t a thing
Wow, a super-luxury sedan with the Ford Focus's turning signal stick.
cool how they kept the general profile from the older lagondas except for the fact that the front looks like a fucking ford fusion lmfao
Thanks to those hydraulic struts it must sound pretty cool when you open and close the doors.
Thhhiiissssss!
My choice is the Lexus ls 500 awd f sport March 2021💪🏿or maybe the blackwing caddy ct6-v 1 of the 2 will be mine 3/5/21
TARAF in Arabic is pronounced exactly as the word ROUGH with TA in the beginning. Tarough
At 14:04 I did a double take on the car seat anchor picture... I thought they were trying to strangle the child in the picture, not anchor the seat down.
I think the grille is dumb, it makes it look like a million dollar Ford Fusion
I would rather the Rolls Royce.  Beautiful piece of art however.
Not a million dollar car. Sorry but no way.
honda accord 😂
This is made for people that view 1 mil like we do in GTA
No, Doug. No.
Whats wrong with an S Class?
Looks like the Ford fusion. Nice looking but not very unique.
If Doug would like to reply me I have a question is his outfit is like a character choice , like jay Leno with his denim? I mean Doug was wearing same shorts ,exact same shoes since I watched him first time maybe 10 years ago , and same style 5$ t-shirts 🤷🏻‍♂️  I would fall dead if Doug would dress up some different outfit like a normal modern man and not like a heading for a hike to the scouts camp all  the time 🙂
1M for this bullshit I'd rather buy a McLaren or lambo and save the rest
This car interior and exterior  looks like it came out in the early 2000's da hell.
when he says DB9 i think he means DB11
you should review a Isuzu Impulse next
Doug is like the high school teacher that knows you deserve a score above but he wants to push you for perfection so he gives you a B+ when he knows you have a solid A-
Lol it does not have ventilated rear seats
Mercedes s class 2000 model i think  more better en more extra 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
I personally think this is one of the ugliest cars I have ever seen
The interior looks like you are on the inside of an expensive shoe
this one is ugly like a modern art masterpiece!
12:01 If it was Aluminum it wouldn't be magnetized lol unless there is a piece of steel on the strap.
Looks like a Passat
It has an ashtray that says Lagonda on the top of it. I can't believe how Doug has become a lier or how stupid millionaires think or how limited is Aston Martin's imagination or how am watching all of these things together!
I mean watch a video of a phantom for half that price, where every single item I unique and then go back to this one. It shouldn't be worth more than than 300K. A limo   that shares a platform with a sports car? Brown leather interior is fine but this is just far too overwhelming. I would prefer Rolls's LED stars - this is just too monotonous. Number of produced units doesn't mean the car is special.
Doug is extremely biased in this review, for some reason... Tbh I think they should really make this into production, and price it like a Bentley Mulsanne, cuz that's the absolute maximum of what I think it's worth.
$1,000,000 without cruise control?
1 mil ? LMAO. Such an outdated design and technologies
You can tell the dealership really wants to get rid of this car...
The Rapide looks MUCH better than the Lagonda. The previous Lagonda was hideous.
*Doug the type of guy to get his granny read the owners manual for his bedtime story*
15:20 So a vehicle made specifically for the Middle East has heated seats in the back, but lacks cooled seats?  Taraf indeed.
Looks like a Rapide in a body kit
i wouldn't even pay 100K for this ugly machine
Love ya Doug, but this is not the most gorgeous sedan.  The styling looks...cobbled together.
Perfect Jakuza car.
Lamborghini Aventador Svj 1,000HP 👉 https://youtu.be/Bzj9sS3CAJk
this car is not beautiful and resembles lines of Quattroporte.  24:55 people don't even turn their heads
Lancia Thesis is more beautiful ...Lotus Omega is more fun...
Overpriced.
And yet it looks like it’s worth a quarter of that price. 😂 🤷🏼‍♀️
I'm sure it's not the only one in the US. Shmee reviewed one in in the States as well.
Doug changes his opinions on whats his favourite car every day so not sure what to believe anymore
looks like 4 door version of a challenger?
Seems like they paid you well to make a respectable commercial of this normal car.
My '15  genesis looks better than this
The new bentley continental flying spur is million times better for a quarter of the price.
Who ever buys this car is a complete idiot.  I bet Kia is more reliable
This is one of the most ugly cars i've ever seen. 1 million for a car without a nice paintjob, only matte black, that looks cheap. Only stupid guys will buy that thing.
This car makes Rolls Royce a true bargain.
Also, I think it looks terrible an is extremely over priced
I wish if Doug have learned how to pronounce the word Taraf right in Arabic before shooting the video :(
Very disappointed, the car is stupidly overpriced and Doug is not talking about it. It smells like sponsored video.
Dougs videos would need a skip intro button very soon, keep that Cars and bids ads at the end of your videos
Phil Jefferies LinkedIn traffic is overflowing
This whole review feels like a joke
Trump 2020
in arabic. the world Taraf means when someone lives in  luxuries life
Horribly looking car, and looks very cheap, especially infotainment systems. Very disappointing
I want my RC Cola cold.
worth 100k
if i could get a dollar for every time you say Lagonda....that would be nice.
It looks like a honda accord, why does people pay a million dollars for it !!!!
Somebody will probably steal it, so I'll stick with my Honda civic.
Million dollar Rapide.
What the hell is this thing? It looks nice, but that's a terrible color for the car. It's not worth anywhere near a million dollars imo.
The fact they use ford turn signal stalks is disgusting for million dollar car
Stupidest Doug review ever. only one actually. This one. Stupid
ewww its matte
Doug is a favourite but here he is tremendously biased. The Lagonda would struggle to be better than a Maybach 600, let alone a Rolls. Pure marketing exercise!
So you tell me this thing is worth 2 phantoms? nahh
Looks pretty good, but most definitely not the best looking sedan imo
Look like ford
He is getting excited for every small detail a modern civic has. I think he just sees those luxury cars and doesnt know all those small details are already available in modern economy cars.
So you spend a million dollars on a stretch rapide with a fridge. Got it.
Seems like a non genuine review which is surprising from Doug. This car is overpriced and no where near the level of “luxury” of the phantom.
I didn’t know they brought back the lagonda
8:50 The only correct attitude/altitude to treat 1M dollars.
Better buy 9 classe s
Million dollar car and so far 10 minutes spent on da headlights 😑
Hmmm I dunno about buying this one chief 😬 it’s missing a lot of luxury features compared to competitors
Doug, say “distinctive” again.
WTF !!! , navigation system (multimedia )  its bullshit , it looks like 20 years ago , cluster it looks same super old and ugly , back lights very old  technology , no dynamyc led lights  ofcourse not OLED , 1000 of times much better Mercedes S class Maybach  and rolls roys
..but do you like the way it looks, Doug?  I actually think other Aston models are nicer looking. To me, the front looks similar to a nicer Honda?  Nice paint, though.
Doesnt even look like an aston martin in the front.
The Taraf doesn’t look better than the E38 & really doesn’t even look better than an Aston Martin Rapide
Starting to think Doug is payed by the companies, because this isn’t even CLOSE to as luxurious as a Rolls, Maybach and even a Bentley, and we all know Doug knows enough about luxury cars to say that this thing is a complete scam for what it is.
doug on his knees for this car
Jesus Christ, who was from the very beginning, the eternal and almighty God, is light and in him there is no darkness at all. He is that true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not. He came unto his own people and his own received him not. Therefore he bid all, even as many as will receive him to attain the power to become the sons of God. Being not born of blood, nor of the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God.   I used to be a sinner like you all here who enjoy this content. I even enjoyed this kind of music for a time during my life. But then something got a hold of me. Something that the world, seemingly now, more than ever lacks. The fear of God got a hold of me. For the fear of God is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God. When I was born again I was able to see the difference between the light and the darkness. I then knew the holiness and righteousness and the wrath of God that surpasses the comprehension of the natural man. I realized that I was, quite literally as they say, on the highway to Hell. Even as quickly as the fear of God and the fear of death and the fear of eternal torment in the fire of hell where the worm never dies and fire in never quenched gripped my heart and mind, God showed me an escape. It was his plan before the foundation of the world, before he breathed his breath of life into man, before he ever said, Let there be light. It was the spotless lamb who was slain before the world was, that is Jesus Christ. The almighty God, nearly 2000 years ago begat a Son in the womb of a woman and called him by his OWN name, JESUS which being interpreted means the One which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty who has come in the flesh to save us. The invisible, eternal, Almighty God was manifest in the flesh, seen of men and angels and the apostles of Jesus Christ beheld the Word of Life in the image of his only begotten Son. And he, being the spotless lamb who was tempted in all points such as we but without sin and who, being reviled reviled not again, gave himself to be nailed and crucified on the cross and bore our sins on a tree. For without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins. Scarcely would a man give his life for a just man and perhaps some may even give their life for a good man. But God, commended his love toward us all, that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for the ungodly.  These things I say unto you all that you may have your hope in Jesus Christ, the light of the world, of whom any that shall walk with him shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. But not just to believe the truth that I have presented unto you, but also that you may receive the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth. That is by the gospel of Jesus Christ. Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. You must be turn from the vomit you’ve grown used to inhaling and you must be washed from the mire you’ve wallowed in. Therefore I say unto you all, Repent from your sins, start obeying God, of whom is life eternal, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This is the plan of God to save his lost sheep who are still bound by sin and in darkness. Blessed are they who receive the call of God this day for today is the day of salvation and many are called but there be few that are chosen. Answer the call if you receive the love of the truth for the choice of your final destination is yours.
Taraf doesn’t mean ultimate luxury in Arabic ( not even close ) 😂
Why does the new genesis g90 look nicer and have more features than this car that costs almost 15 times.
Pretty shitty overall car. Terrible waste of money
8:42 Doug really thought he was gonna slide through filming on his knees like tf lmaoo
$1mil, for the middle east market, heated seats, no cooled seats 🤦🏼‍♂️
I love this style you insert the key and start engine.
Those wheels look like aftermarket stuff to me...
beautiful? ehhh... the phantom and the mulsane are far more striking. this has the front of an accord/charger. where are the mind-blowing features and/or capabilities? like, the m5 can pin you in the seat, and so can a tesla p100d. the phantom and the mulsane look just amazing. a panamera turbo s is very special. and what is this? a means for some arab oil shiekkhhh to say: "eh! u only pay 600k for pfanthhtom? LOSER! i pay 1 MILLION for ziiissss!!!!!!!!!! BWAHAHAHAA!!!! I WEEEENNN!!!!!!" doors are cool, but no sun/moon roof? a turn signal signal stalk from a ford focus!!!??? and the best part? this shit will fall apart in 5 years. rarity? i own a 1974 vaz2103... there are maybe like 2 of them in LA, but it's a communist era pile of junk - special only to the ruskis.
That rear door gas spring is such an after thought and totally wank 😂
This car reminds me of some people I know. It is beautiful on the outside but I find the colors on the inside horrific
What's the cheapest non-luxery sedan in the world?
"You'd think with an old single-clutch transmission like this..." No, it's not a single clutch unit, it's an 8-speed ZF automatic transmission. Only the V8 and V12 Vantage had the Graziano single clutch automated manuals. In a DB9 (Virage, DBS) or Rapide, the automatic option really is a full-fledged torque converter automatic.
Everyone: "ultimate luxury" Doug demuro: "ultimate Luoucshuriey"
Looks rather cheap for a 1 million dollar car.
The front basically looks like a Dodge Charger
Honestly, because the price tag is so outrageous I cannot respect this car for what it is... also, I’ve just lost some respect for Aston Martin for even pulling this stunt!
This feel like a cash grab from Aston Martin. They just made this to profit off of the market in the Middle East. It’s not like they wanted to make a quality competitor.
Looks like a Chevy Malibu from the front a little bit. Doesn't say luxury to me. The Lexus GS F sport looks better.
530 hp for 1 million!? Now Way! I can get Dodges with more horsepower for about 930k less!!
Could not get past the key hole on the door .. that’s one hole I don’t want after spending a million dollars 🤣
Euro spec?
its amazing to see how you make an exciting video of a boring car.
In the early 90s i had 2 lagonda customers at Motorsport engineering in pompano beach fl. I actually call a call from Euro Austin Martin headquarters and the indignant offical asked me why i was servicing his cars? I had just put a Dodge starter on one that was 1/3 of the AM price, i pointed that out ,he hung up. There's more to that story.
Rolls Royce does what Lagon-dont.
Not worth the money
if this car in 10/10 in design, i dont want to immagine how your wife looks
Looks like a Ford Fusion
The Rapide still exist soooooo
front reminds me of HOnda Accord, and the rear 3/4 reminds me of Dodge challenger
Seen one of these in Saudi Arabia!
Why are so many people saying this is a paid review? It most certainly isn’t. Doug is always honest no matter what car he reviews. He has reviewed cars from many dealerships but you can tell he’s being honest. This is just his opinion, which is what every viewer of Doug Demuro videos watch for. Even then, why would he be trying to sell the viewers on a million dollar car when 99.9% of all his viewers can most likely/most definitely cannot afford it?
Who the hell buys thus for a million.... is crap
Why would I buy this over a phantom?
Se va vinde in Romania ca painea calda.. Taraf !
Pls try to find a one to one koenisigg and review
this car’s really ugly
If I had the choice between a Subaru outback or this, I'm pretty sure I would be happier with the Subaru.  What a waste of resources and money....
Why is there an ashtray?!?!?? Anyone who smokes in a $1m dollar car deserve to be thrown out with the ashes
The rolls is way better and more lexuriaous looking and feeling I'ma be honest if I saw that car in the street I would think it was a cheap car from India or something what Is that brick of a screen BTW
Would choose the S65 a Million Times over this trash bin
Million dollars for this car?  Wow, some people do have money to throw around.
Poor people: “iT iS vErY oVeRpRiCeD.”
If you told me that this was the new Genesis Flagship sedan I wouldn’t have argued with you.
Ugly af.
Wow, this car is the biggest waste of money I've ever seen. If there's every any doubt on either to buy a Phantom, or a Taraf. Just watch this video. Then his 2018 Rolls Royce Phantom video.
Gorgeous circles
This looks exactly like a BMW 7 Series......
Why does it look like a genesis?
16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18  Have a blessed day.
What can it possibly have that make is worth that much? it should come with a fridge full of cold one's and hot sex slaves in trunk at least.
It's ugly.
I aswell have one but it goes slow on the carpet can somebody tell me why?
Looks Like a fucking Peugeot
That styling is not a 10
A Mercedes S63 AMG blows this thing out of the water for 1/8th the price. Truly unbelievable that people paid a million dollars for this
I know this video was posted yesterday, but how old is this car, really? It certainly looks like it’s at least a decade or 2 old
One M for this thing wow
I never even heard of that car.
the front looks like a ford taurus and bmw i8 mix
I don’t get why anyone would pay this much for this car.
It looks kinda like a Honda Accord mixed with a Ford Fusion.
I get Maserati and Genesis vibes from this car...totally nothing special 🤷‍♂️
From the thumb nail I thought it’s Chinese made car from geely
The names is exquisite
I love the radio, still on DAB on Talksport. DAB isn't available in the US, this seems to be in the UK, although with LHD.
It honestly looks like a Dodge... Just saying
That’s the most boring looking $1m car of all time
Who would buy this car ? It is fugly
Except for that engine and the looks...what an extremely  overrated low-tech piece of shit, one million dollars..yeah sure buddy.
This is an over priced car.this same luxury we can get from Genesis new GV80. It is only $ 70,000. If someone pays a million dollars for this one actually  that money does not go to the luxury, but to the name brand Aston Martin. Basically rich people waste millions of dollars to keep their rich class  status.
Impostor.
Even the name Lagonda Taraf sounds like the name of a car from GTA.
Hi Doug, maybe I missed it but I remember when the Taraf first came out the reviewers said it had a carbon fiber body which was one of the reasons it cost 1 million dollars.
welcome to another video of "you cant afford this"
Doug on a first date:  "Let me tell you about my quirks and features".
Seems like low effort high quality luxury if that makes sense.      Bob: Let's cover everything in leather, leather means luxury! Phil: What about a fridge, you can't have luxury without one. So what if it makes the trunk inelegant, just throw an umbrella back there, no cool hiding spot either. Bob: We can save money by taking stuff from our other cars, I'll go to the parts bin. Phil: While you do that I'll make things move that otherwise wouldn't in a normal car; speakers, an old Garmin I found in the basement, a cigarette ashtray. People still smoke and not vape right? Jill: I found an $8 hydraulic rod, let me throw it on the doors with no effort to conceal it. Bob: What do you guys think we should charge? Jill: $80,000! Phil: $120,000! Bob:Nope $1,000,000! Jill & Phil: Are you out of your mind, what idiot would pay that much? Bob: I know where we can find some stupid rich people.
A Genesis is more functional and more high-tech, an S-Class is better and more luxurious in almost every way besides material quality and a standard 540i have pretty much the same wheels.  Honestly it is bullshit. This is not for rich car enthusiasts but for very rich people who doesnt give a f*ck about cars.
Aston definitely paid Doug for this video
I really want to see this review but not listen to Doug. My my he doesn't sound good to a Scotsman. Good luck to you anyhow Doug no offence meant.
Goes through the trouble of making a glass B pillar, meanwhile leaving a keyhole placed as obviously as on my 20 year old pick-up truck....
1 million and still uses Apple iPads smh
Doug is the type of guy to say sorry to the car after an accident
I still find the e38 740iL the best looking sedan ever made.
So you’re telling me wrap everything in leather and put a 1 million tag on it
Say luxury one more time...
That plastic quality is worse than my 2004 Golf 5
A cool 1 mil for 2 Ford Duratec V6s joined end to end. That engine has served well but it was time for an update or at least some form of forced induction.   Is it just me or is that trunk lid alignment atrocious??? Me thinks that car has seen damage...maybe that's why it was given the green light to import it.
I'd expect a glass panoramic roof for a million bucks.
Would love to see a Stutz Blackhawk
when u see the cars and bids car MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
BMW i8 on roids
Overpriced
Dude i wanna know hows the glove box and the center console compartments, not all the places where it says lagonda smh
no thanks, s550 will do for me
Most the "cool" features, the LS430 has had since 2001. Which you can enjoy for 1 million...miles
Aston must be high
say "Lagonda" one more time...
This..... is a disgrace!
looks like a weird long Ford Fusion, dumb car
Somebody tell Aston Martin we don't need them in America at all
He's on the rooftop of the Petersen Auto Museum in case anyone was wondering
Half equipped s class or bmw 7 has more luxury and features
This is not worth 1 million
A million dollars for a cocoon of cow skin. It would be disturbing if it was human skin, no?
Speaking of Aston Martin, here's the new James Bond trailer- https://youtu.be/RhUZJQ-Wz_0
How is this car beautiful? The only beautiful thing is the resale value after one day out of the showroom
when you rich but like Honda Accord front
Speaking of Aston Martin logo not appearing in the entire car except the on the engine.. there's one in the infotainment system.. quite prominent.
It’s a British charger
Looks like a Mazda6 on steroids
Add vertical LEDs on the side and its a Peugeot 508
Does the front end remind anyone else of a Honda Accord?
1:24 super expensive fancy sign and they couldnt even cover the bolts on the mounting plates lol
I'd rather get an Equus
10:00 - Stay exactly.... * door starts to close, Doug Panics and holds it up* there
For 1 million dollars, I have never been this unimpressed by design.. nothing absolutely impressive or beautiful, or never seen before. shape is weird and definitely not timeless
The lights and grille looks like a Honda Accord. Tf
I usually agree with Doug's take on cars. Not the case here. I really don't like the styling. Wouldn't like to spend 1KK for a Maserati looking аss car with Fiesta switches  Good enough for Persian Gulf nouveau riche though
Not worth
Considering this car was made in 2015 it's pretty nice,  imagine how much leather cleaner and conditioner you would go through
The back styling seems inspired from 2010 Camaro, and headlights looks like bmwi8 from the side and the disappointing thing is it does have Sun roof!
1 million dollars and the turn signal stalk is from a Ford Fusion.
It is not worthy of 1 million$.
At last the Taraf. Styling 12!!!
They made this rubbish in 2018? What a bunch of losers.
Personally I don’t think it looks that special on the outside.  I think the A8, s63, or B7 looks way better!!
A Vovo S90 is nicer than this 'Ford'.
Lagonda is much less luxurious than a maybach ,bentley or a rolls royce...then why would anyone want this luxury expensive car if its not luxurious than a 100000 dollar car ??
This is the type of cars that would look so much better with a glossy or metallic paint. This matte black doesn't work in my opinion
Excellent video Doug. 👍
No one wants to buy this abomination from Ogara, eh Doug?
Hyundai G70 design team:  "Hold my beer"
You have to admit the front looks like a little bit of a  2015 DODGE DART!!
The lack of interior perks for a $1mm car is astounding. My Audi A5 has more features. I’d much rather have a Mercedes S550 for 15% of the price of this.
Truly is one of the most beautiful cars around. Its not to everyones taste but its probably seriously eye catching if you happen to see one on the street. As for the tech they obviously reused the Rapide dash but realistically the people who buy this probably couldn't care less.
Aston Martin couldn't build a good car but they selected the right market of goof brats. This is called market strategy
if that centenario review goes online in december ill be pissed
Well, as of about five minutes ago, Aston Martin was the one manufacturer who I thought could do no wrong.  This is their one design I simply do not like.
First time Doug's words aren't supporting his facial expressions. I thought he would suddenly say.. Hey viewers sorry for being a big liar. Don't waste your money on this million dollar shittt
I don't understand those dislikes ???!!!!!!
This car really reminds me the Quartz Regalia from Final Fantasy games, and that thing is purely the best looking car ive seen. And yeah I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me on this but I for me its truely the most beautiful sedan ive ever seen. I don't see this as a "facelift" of any kind or an expensive ripoff of any car made before. The grille is pretty much taken from any Aston Martin as we know it but heck this thing looks so freaking slick. One thing tho Aston should have put way more equipment in it and hide the freaking key holes on the doors... And yeah I wouldn't pay million dollars for this thing... I would pay around 300K for this but no more than that.
Aston charges what they do for their vehicles cause they can. Was expecting amazing. I love Aston Martins but personally I feel the Lagonda is just nice. Not 1 million dollars nice though. Still a lovely car 👍
This car is where you would rather buy a rolls royce to be "more reasonable and save money".
The Rapide is prettier
Cool but not amazing compared to a rolls or a bentley
It looks like masarati🧐🧐🧐
It gives me orgasm when doug says lagonda everytime
the first three minutes of this video ... is three minutes of your life you will never get back :(
This car doesn't deserve to be more expensive than the Mercedes S Class
Looks like a luxury Dodge Charger...
shit car
"The most beautiful looking sedan ever." Literally looks like a stretched out Mondeo.
Crap! Its ugly! It ugs in the ugly! And u gotta be kidding me with the 1M $ Price
Is it me or does the front end look like the new accord?
For a million dollars it should come with a happy ending.
he is getting older every video tho🤭did someone notice?
Why do all of these ultra luxury car brands assume that the back seat passengers want to drink bottles of wine or champagne? Make some room for a case of beer, maaaan!
Front, from the side bumper styling resembles Lada Vesta
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. Non-Duality✌️
This car smells so nice I can smell it from Doug's video
The front of this car looks exactly like a Ford Fusion.  It’s nice, but just baffled why he thinks it’s SOOO beautiful.
"Yes sir, the price is one million dollars" "But the paintwork is a matt finish?" "Yes sir, gloss finish is EXTRA!"
doug iv seen you kneel in alot of your videos.. you need to take better care of your knees bro....
What are the cars that will keep you from changing cars for 15 years?
It’s the worst lookin Aston Martin ever made. 🤷🏻‍♂️
that's the biggest ford fusion ive ever seen.
Doug never disappoints with his ignorance.  The Taraf has an 8-speed ZF automatic transmission, not a "single clutch" automated manual.  Also, the "circle pattern" on the seats?  Really?  Ever hear of "broguing?"
Very disapointing
doesn't worth a dollar above 100k.
15 years in future we'll watch certain "dumbest automotive show in youtube" host buy this to his hooptie fleet.
If i had the money I don’t think in a million years I’d waste an extra $400,000 for this thing... Rolls Royce does it so much better.
That car is ugly from the thumbnail also doug really sounds like hes trying to sell it and it almost sounds like he is trying to convince himself its cool when deep down he knows its not he knows its garbage
Someone tell him that Model 3 / Model Y also have glass on the B pillar.
I feel like about 50% of the price is for the exterior design alone.
We REALLY get it.  It is a veeeeeery luxury and expensive car. BUT no difference to other very luxury and expensive cars.
So, I've been watching your videos for a while and we share a lot of similar opinions in tastes and such, but not this car. I agree that you're paying for the rarity, but I think there's too many drawbacks for it to be THAT expensive. If they went the route Bugatti went and made it timeless, it would be a whole different story, but they put a Garmin in there and parts from the Rapide that made it look dated from day one. I agree that the backseat handle and the hydraulic doors are cool but those are all cheap ideas. Ipad holders....really....and honestly, it does look cool, but the exterior lacks some of the other quirks that these other luxury brand cars have. Personally, I think the lights look basic and the front of the car looks like the Ford Fusion. The other Lagonda video you did had me excited, I would kill for that car, despite it aging alright.  I guess I'm a commoner because if I had the money to kill and I was a Middle Eastern business man, I'd choose the Rolls-Royce Cullinan Black Badge.
That car better can wash, cook, clean, give head, get its cheeks clapped, fly me to the moon, and be an underwater submarine all in one for that kind of money
i speak Arabic and I've never heard of the word Taraf before.
i still think the 2001 7 series looks better
I could pay off my house and still have 800k left over smh
This car is not particularly beautiful, Doug is very biased towards expensive and rare cars. The shape is not harmonious at all.
it looks horrible
I'm sorry but nothing about the aesthetics of the car says "beautiful" to me personally, but maybe I'm just looking at it from the wrong angle..?
I rather buy a 2nd Bugatti
Doug: “you can drive it around... if you have a million dollars”    *proceeds to drive it around*
One million dollars yet no fog lights
The door will stay where you put it............. 10:04, DARNIT
Why does the front look a little like a really well designed Ford Taurus
i am not impresses d at all....i see flaws allover the leather works...belongs in Dubai and nowhere  else...
It looks like this was filmed at the Peterson Auto Museum.
Forget the taraf. I’m obsessed with the lambo in his cnb promo
What does the arabic word "Taraf - طرف -" in this settings mean?
I rather buy the Rolls
Only Middle Easterners who don't know what to do with their money would pay a million dollars for this car. It looks like a $100,000 car to me.
I'm surprised it uses gooseneck trunk hinges instead of articulating.
Depretiation is gonna kill this thing in under  a decade 😭
That’s not 1 million worth of car imo no hate still very nice but not worth a whole Mill 🥴
How u speak is so annoying
Doug hits the nail on the head at the end. You aren’t paying 1 million dollars for the luxury, you’re paying for the rarity and exclusivity. Car is nothing more than a over hyped rapide.
Spending millions of dollars for a lagonda with an umbrella in the trunk just spend 550k for a 2018 phantom with an umbrella in the door panel that what we call luxury tho
O'Gara listing: Make us an offer...
It’s really a beautiful car in real life! Saw one of these in Beverly Hills.
This is a stupid person in the world
Dislike squad please assemble.
Bentley continental looks wayy better and has much better interior. Bias towards this one strong.
Such a nice diarrhea brown interior.....
One million for a Ford? Plz Ford, sell this company to Porsche. Then the cars become good cars too.
Had they reimagined the 80's Lagonda (complete with the single spoke steering wheel), this would have been a LOT more worth it. While they won't fall to reasonable levels, these will fall to $150K with 20K miles on them in 10 years. Can you imagine what you could do with a $600K fully loaded Phantom and an extra $400K in custom work? But I guess this is why the rich Arabs buy the "1" licence plates for millions.
Navigation system in my 7000 usd 2018 ford looks better than this. This system and the price tag screams of arrogance of Astin Martin. They're essentially saying : we'll poop in a tin can and put our logo on it and you'll still buy it becuase you're gullible and we own your sanity.
This is gonna be so popular in Romania
Meh
Only people who didn't come from Tik: tok can like this
I think he subconsciously compared it to a Ford Taurus at 7:44, because that's what the Taraf looks like to me.
Hmmm apart from the looks nothing more worth then 60 k
The ugliest car I’ve ever seen. 1 million dollars and you get basically the same paint found in the Veloster Turbo. Rolls Royce are WAAAY better
I probably won't be in the majority here, but honestly, I don't think the styling is as attractive as most (okay probably all) other Aston Martin models over the past 10 years.  I think I might like EVERY 1 of those designs better than this.  ALSO, not a fan of the matte black (give me my normal paint shine over this any day).    In summary,  not a horrible design mind you, and the "wrapped" look has a… well, maybe certain" cool factor," just not my cup of Earl Grey.
1 000 000 dollar car;  Tablets with bezels.
Front end looks like a honda lmao
One MILLION dollars!  Muh hah hah hah hah!
I would not put children in that car
Okay what the hell is that noise that happens every time he turns the steering wheel to the right!?!?  You can here it at exactly 25:00
At first I hated it, but now I realize its kind of a big dick move to wear khacki shorts in a million dollar car. Keep ballin, Doug.
Doug forgot to tell us, why it cost 1 000 000$
Crazy people spend 1 million for just powerful engines! Nothing special
that license plate holder is a sin.
The rear end looks like the last  Swedish Saab 9-5.
what makes it 1 mil? apart from the full leather interior and V12 it is no different from like a 2009 S- class...
Idk about spending a million on a car lol how about a yatch
The price of this car is at rockstar levels: "cheap" for GTA standards but expensive for real life.
2018!!!! You sure??? The features and interior looks more like 2008.
That interior looks tacky as fuck
0:02 Doug is the type of guy to continue pronouncing years after 2010 as “two thousand ______” instead of switching over to “twenty ______”
LOL I had that shift stock in my Ford Focus and that infotainment system is trash for the most luxurious car. 2018??
10 mins in nd it’s already 3 ads
13:05 :O
How many cows had to give up their hide for this interior? :-D
what a dumb car
I SAW THAT CENTENARIO DOUG WHERE IS THAT REVIEW
The Lamborghini estoque looking quite different here.
gta car
How much does this car cost again?
“Taraf” means luxury in Arabic
This Tardraf is worth maybe 200k tops + 800k exclusivity tax.
Довольно удивительно видеть на брелоке значок Росстандарта. То есть машину делали в расчете не только на арабских шейхов, но и на уборщиц из Газпрома.
I'm always hoping for these big performance luxury cars to get a better DougScore than mid engine supercars. Sedan, Wagon and Fastback are just better body styles than a super/hypercar IMO, I can't see how can't you appreciate sedans.
Pay a million dollars for an umbrella and get a free limited production car Pretty sweet deal
Ugliest 1m dollar car I've ever seen
I like Doug’s views, but starting to think he really loves Ford. I saw the car and immediately thought Ford. From the side, it’s body lines remind me of a MKZ, the headlights look like Honda Accord from the side, until you get to the front, then you can really see a Ford Fusion with the light/grill combo. The back body lines really resemble a MKZ.
Now we see who honda was copying on
Aston Martin: We will make the Lagonda only for the Middle East market! Also Aston Martin: Puts umbrella in the trunk.
I love the using of ford parts.  My favorite: My brother in law came out to the farm one weekend in his Lincoln Continental. He broke down on our rough driveway. Inspection found the distributor cap had come lose and the rotor was broken. Needing a part on a Sunday, I decided to check my '66 Mustang. Same rotor, My BIL was insistent that it must be a 'similar' part as his car was a Lincoln, not a Ford.  The next day, I was stuck out on the farm with a missing rotor. With nothing better to do, I checked the distributor on the 3 cylinder Ford tractor. You guessed it, the same rotor and I was back on the road. I never told my brother-in-law.
So why is this worth a million dollars?
What's the model of the lamborghini in the cars and bids promo?
Imagine how much this thing will depreciate.
Looks like china genisis g90
The proportions on this car are odd looking and off. The front end resembles a bmw i8 in spots.  Honestly, just buy a Koenigsegg Gemera... much better looking and around the same price with much more luxury and performance.
the brake calipers should be white
This looks like a new honda accord
I'd get 2 rolls royce over this instead. No wonder why Aston Martin didn't market here in the US.
Stop saying cars from this era. It was 2 years ago Doug, you’re making me feel old :(
The front reminds me of a Honda Accord. Also the taillights reminds me of a Acura NSX.
Ford *sells a $1 million car* *puts a Focus blinker stick in it* smh
It doesn’t look THAT nice!
Used Rapide comes in 60000$, pay an extra 20 grand, pimp it and wallah, here's your Million Dollar Lagonda!
Doug you're really trying to justify this car but I think given the price bracket it falls short on both power and design.
10:03 FAIL
Looks like the child of a Mazda 3 and a Rapide
You can tell Doug was payed by Aston Martin to review this car
Proving of course ... beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Doug, it's cool, but frankly it's just not that special.  I enjoy your reviews, but you got snookered on this one Doug.
1 million for that? At best it looks like a 250k car.
Even if I had the million, this is very disappointing
Paying gta money for a gta car. This would probably be a accord mixed with a altima and Hyundai sonata.
Even trump can't afford this!
I'll take two
Much love and respect for Doug. But dayum dude. The majority of North America uses metric. Please stop saying that North America doesn’t use metric.
Why is it black tho
Doug sweetie my 2002 Daewoo Leganza looks 10 times better than this 💀💀💀💀
It’s a fancy Ford Fusion 😂
Doug is on trending!!!
At least, the navigation system looks like a Braun device or is in the Bauhaus style. Clear, simple and not a color / icon overkill. Worth a million Dollars, indeed.
Looks like a Ford Taurus
A centenario cant wait for it.
I’m no hater of “sponsored” content. yet I can’t shake the feeling that the biased inspiration was above average for this one.
The wheels hv a " looking into James Bond's revolver" look to them
damn! What is Aston Martin smokin lately?
When i see a Rolls i can even understand the price but this one...my 2019 Mercedes A class have better features...i also thought you over liked this one...i don’t even see a particularly beautiful car
Its a rapide. Just a different body. Its a beautiful car, but its a joke for the price
This car doesn't scream luxury like the 2018 Rolls-Royce Phantom and costs twice the price. Like, wtf, the Rolls-Royce has sooooo much stuff in it and it is about 550k at most with every item you may desire and this one is bare bonesaf. It does look cool, but they priced it like a gta dlc car.
6:40 so they made it look like a charger/accord? Lol
Such an underwhelming car for $1 million
What a Rip-off.
I can’t be the only one that think the headlights look like the Honda Accord 10th gen 😂
if a maserati and genesis had a baby
This is the best looking sedan for Doug. For me its Bentley Mulsanne Speed
If this doesn’t deserve a 1 on value, what possibly could?
Carsandbid.com  is like Forza horizon 4 bid in real life
If I’m spending $1 MIL on a car no kids are going to be in it 😂 especially if it’s the only one in North America
14:07 Are you sure the anchor is not around the kid's neck....?
Nice job Doug! You got on trending!
Its the first time you look paid bro.
Honda Accord front end , door definitely was closing when it was let go 😂, the inside instruments look worse than an Altima rental,  Walmart satnav . This is a gta car fr
I particularly admire the central strips of seat fart holes. Individual electric suction motors expel the noxious hot gases out through the turbo so no energy is wasted.   Now you know why it's called the Taraf.  Anagram
What are you doing bro, you're losing credibility
Looks like a 150k car.
10:40  My wife, she is also tight in back😌 .....god I'm immature 😔
Doug the type of guy that reviews a Million Dollar luxury car with dirty knees
Hold on, 1million dollar car and you got to buy iPads to go into it. I would imagine they would have there own entertainment system, Then a iPad. 🤦🏼‍♂️
La-Z-Boy is easier to pronounce
idk it doesn't look good enough
That Centenario doe😳
The rear end makes it look like a boat.
Aston Martin clutching at straws 😂
Hahah doors wanted to closed but he held it opened
Come on Doug! Most beautiful sedan ever? It could easily be mistaken for a Ford Fusion from a distance...
Even my ram has cooled rear seats.
The rear looks like à Genesis
Is it just me or it actually seem cheap inside? the local aftermarket interior designers can stitch leather better than this. The only part which looked quality was under the hood rest is not even worth more than any $50,000 car.
how many times you wanna use the word "distinctive" Doug: *yes*
Doug if they get you as a hostage just blink twice 😅😅😅
This video is a lengthy paid advertisement looking at how the cost of this car is being justified.
It's not worth 1 million. But you said it; it's rarity and different style.
Talking about cars and bids in front of centenario😂 lmao
Is that the car on the Doug Demuro profile picture?
This car isn’t worth 1 million dollars and Bentleys and Rolls Royces are better than this car and are cheaper!
good article  https://recreationalmarijuanashops.com/product/kurupts-moonrocks/ Kurupt’s Moonrock by BOG Seeds is an indica-dominant hybrid cross between Blue Moon and BOG Bubble.

10 out of 10 score for design?! i am not sure...
I grew up in the town that Lagonda is from.
Funny how he just brushed off the infotainment situation. Doug definitely got paid for this lol
Can you do a review on the Mitsubishi lancer evolution?
For a million dollars, this is such a crappy car... You gotta be really stupid to buy this
Thank you Doug I never have known about this car, very cool!
Should have been electric. Could have saved a few inches on the total body length and increased inches in the interior.
I can't believe Doug is so positive about the styling.  I think the Ford Fusion looks better and I hate Fords. Wtf?
Planet....  hahahahahahah  now thats funny!
الله اعلم من سيقراء تعليقي عندي لك هديك  😙 😉 😗 😜 😘 😚 الله يفرج ☝👍همك اذا  حطيت لي اشتراك7
whatever they may explain, a car without the button press door close priced at $1M just don make sense... the phantom even have rear wheel steer. i don think this car can.
They KNOW NOT to bring that overpriced Jaguar here because here in AMERICA we've known that Mr Martin's people lost their damn minds a few years back
Car buyer: How much are you asking for the Aston Martin? Aston Martin dealer: (raises right hand and puts pinky finger to lips) "One Million Dollars."
Man you talk to much,  get to the point already ...at the end it ain't worth the price
Doesn't justify the million dollar price tag. Looks-wise, it doesn't even come close to Maybach. No bullet-proofing either
The Phantom he reviewed was much more impressive.
aston always sell their cars like apple sell their airpods. the price doesn't make sense. this is ridiculously expensive. like, did they even saw how a phantom looks inside. dude the phantom have that constellation stars on the top...this is just leather....wtf!
What a shit-box.
Lol updated Cadillac Seville
...and it looks like shit from the side. Wonderful.
All it has is leather, where's the luxury?
Overpriced. Trust me none of the richest person in the world gonna buy this shit. What a bad move from aston martin.
Cant stand that at $1million they cant make bespoke pieces of interior equipment. Not good enough.
Idk, all these luxury cars are just kinda meh to me.  I'll be more impressed  with whoever designs a Miata for $10k, than this luxury car for $1 million.
Boring a$$ overpriced run-of-the-mill modern car with an oversized grill.  Most beautiful 4-door car?  Really Doug???  At least the old Lagonda was interesting.
Are the people who would walk past Genesis, Maserati, Porsche, Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Rolls Royce, Bentley, and still want to buy a car that’s not even that pretty from many angles?
Another 3yrs you'll be able to pick one up for $30,000
The front kinda looks like the lovechild of  an accord and i8:/
I can hear C3P0 saying "Lagonda Taraf" while stomping his feet
that grill looks like  Jack Nicholson grinning (as Joker)
7:00 the front has a snake look from my point of view...
The Styling looks 10yrs dated 🤣😂💀
https://youtu.be/gdZLi9oWNZg
Thanks for your efforts ... great review .. I saw it in Dubai WooooooW
I’d rather get a Tesla..
Hideous
$1m and no sunroof? WTF
I don't see 1 million dollars here. Sorry.
The front looks like a honda bruh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP07Jq5b88M
Fun fact: I used to work in the factory manufacturing those seat belt buckles covered in leather. Well, those are just Ford buckles and the majority of them were actually production line rejects which had scratches or other defects, but when covered in leather, those defects were no longer an issue.
A 1 Million Dollar Luxury Sedan,          ....with a Focus turn signal stalk.  Ah how luxury touches our everyday lives!
doug is the type of guy that goes to bed with a ruler to see for how long he slept.
Looks like a stretched Ford Mondeo.
Even the mulsanne is better than this
Front portion from the side looks like bmw i8 seems like they only focused on getting the price high.
Imagine a clueless passenger just clicking the buttons on the console and changing gears
This car looks like it costs 150k-200k
Is it me or is the front just a Hyundai grill with Accord lamps? Can’t unsee it 😂
It’s a shame that companies can make amazing cars like these and then only make a small amount so they can artificially inflate the price and you will never see them driving. These are going to sit it climate controlled garages their whole life as they are sold to the next billionaire with disposable income.
That steak is definitely not worth the sizzle!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdZLi9oWNZg
Never be one of those cars. Tyler Hoover: Challenge Accepted.
Rather than buying this car at 1m I rather invest half of it in crypto currencies
You'd have to absolutely insane to buy this and not a Rapide
This is a beautiful car - it's too bad they didn't make more of them at a price of 300k or so.
Doug is the type of guy that tells you he will answer your question later but never does
1-No the most beautiful for me.  Rolls royce for me, an Audi S8 or the upcoming S-Class.  2- The setting to review a $1 million dollar car was not appropriate :), maybe a ball room would have fit the bill.  Thanks Doug for your always good reviews that are entertaining as well.
Taraf (ترف): Wealth, luxurious, Fortune
TEDDY FEELS DISAPPOINTED.  Such a waste of time.
Yes Doug, I do have a million bucks. I do because I don't blow my money on the vanity of exclusivity.
the front looks like BMW I8
You missed the fact that the body is made of carbon fiber
HAAHAHAHAAH SCREW THE PHANTOM
How the fuck is this 1 million dollars much rather have a phantom
Moral of the story hoes know what a phantom is. hoes will say that's a cute Kia
I just don't see a million dollars. I would rather have a Roles.
That poor car got done so dirty being put in matte black it looks awful
But we rather have a phantom than that car so the value means nothing
If a car company makes a million dollar car everything should be perfect( vents, screens, buttons) like pagani, bugatti, koenigsegg does. There is no excuse. Everything else looks cheap
Not worth 1mi at all
Not worth a million but it certainly looks a million bucks. I love it.   That Garmin Sat Nav is poor though.
This car’s key has a Russian certification sign!!! «РСТ»!!! Some Russian oligarch must’ve been driven this car!
Someone orders of the most unique sedans of recent years... Adorns it with disgusting matte black.
Expensive is not how you spell ugly
Sorry bud, Rolls Royce Sweptail is 14 million, so your car is no where near most expensive sedan.
At 24:16 you can hear that British quality.
I expected a pinky in the side of the mouth on at least one of the ONE MILLION DOLLAR proclamations.
When are you going to review that Centenario?😃😜
Doug, it's called a B-pillar...
Doug, you keep saying that word “Luxury”. I don’t think it means what you think it means.
I'd get the price, if it was a 1 of car, but 120 of these? That's ridiculous. Just like the leather headliner, who the hell cares about that? Yeah, the styling is nice (especially the rear portion), but that front end just reminded me of this: https://www.pngkit.com/png/detail/346-3465671_cyanide-and-happiness-disgusted-face.png If I owned one of these, I'd probably spend some extra money just to get the car's face fixed and that would make it a lot more unique, too.  Again, $1.000.000 for a completely unspectacular car that's a 1/120, just why?
Tarath literal meaning is Heritage but it can be used as well to describe generational wealth
Wtf 😂 front looks like Honda accord 😡 Db11 way cuter ❤️
tbh i dont think it is as bueatiful as he says. In my view Aston martin DBS looks way better
Ok ik am not crazy but this looks just like Ford Taurus
It has a ZF 8speed autobox, not a single clutch.
Ugliest 1M $ car ive ever seen a phantom is a lot better
Sorry to say but this time doug wsnt enough honest ... he was getting hyped by those doors which even alfaromeo giulia / maserati ghibli had !!!!!
It just looks like a really long Ford Fusion got rear-ended
Yay finally a 10 out of 10 from Doug for the styling
I wonder if all were sold
I wonder what would happen if Kia made a exact copy of this car, except with plastic and an average engine.
Please tell me you've shot a video with that centanario
Charging $1m for a car with wheels that look like they came from the corner Auto Zone. Really?!
Reminds me of the Albany V-STR from GTA
That thing is hideous! Most beautiful sedan? GTFO
This should be just slightly higher to a panamera turbo S
rapide is much nicer. Just for rich Arabs with more money than taste or sense.
Everyone is missing the point...It's a LAGONDA and there are only 120 made. Doesn't matter if the tech is cheap or you prefer a LS or Rolls, IT IS A LAGONDA! Look at car history FFS!
If I had a mil, I'd rather get the Phantom and probably shoot this car twice for the price
What a rip off!!
okay, that is just simply the most suitable car for James Bond's supervillain.
Lol this ain't even worth it chief
Doug the type of guy to keep his socks and shoes in when he's in the shower.
🐔"If you hang out with chickens, you will be locked up, and if you hang out with eagles, you will fly."🦅  ✔️Follow me to Fly with Eagles.
That's not worth 500k let alone a mill.
Challenger tail-end, BMW i8 headlights, R8 Grill = Los Santos Custom’s Finest
Front end ford focus rear from a dodge charger.
Bentleys are more beautiful and more exquisite both exterior and interior.
Can you find a V16 rolls royce to do a review.. the one with the 9L engines used in Johny English
It looks like a dodge charger concept🤣
Can you rewiew alfa romeo 164
Imagine how good it will look when they cover the black primer with a real paint job.
I’d rather had a sunroof, glass roof or something before a leather roof. Especially for 1 million. Yea this isn’t worth that to me but that’s just my broke ass 😂😂😂
Imagine how confused people who have seen doug multiple times must be , one day he's in a Pagani Zonda the next day a 91' Honda Civic
Qualifying "most expensive sedan" with "luxury" makes it sound less impressive not more. As there may well be a more expensive sport sedan etc.
20:21 - you will not find Aston Martin logo in this car  Well, I guess I saw it at 16:51.
it looks like a 2015 Chrysler 200 from the front, ngl
I'm glad other people have also commented that It's not worth 1mil+  I was going to say that it's a beautiful car but I don't see where the 1 million went
I wonder if Jay Leno's garage has one...
New car?
Aston Martin wanted some of that oil money
Is it really as beautiful as he says or is it just me who finds the looks of this car very ordinary.
So wrong to say this is a scam or a ripoff. Only a ripoff if it doesn't do what it should or lacks quality. Sure, AM must have made $600k + profit per car and good for them and the people that build these things. Much better than begging for taxpayer funded bailouts or hiding behind chapter 11 to escape paying suppliers and workers.
When shopping for a nice wristwatch, the jeweler presents and demonstrates it wearing gloves.  You review a $1million dollar car wearing shorts and a T-shirt.
Ugly
Ugly
idk man. Genesis G80 or G90 looks just as good from outside lol
It is "Taraf" not "Turraf" ,man!!
"Famous" ft Young thug ft Kayne West 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇 https://youtu.be/LyRzBk1XFGU
Seems ordinary to me. Honestly.
Its a honda accord with swapped out badges.
All of these door handles look like the sim card slot cover.
From the front, I can see hints of the new Mazda 3 with the lights and grill.. wouldn't be the first Aston Martin borrowing design queues from Mazda
What a crappy car
The car built exclusively for rich fools.
Yo, this thing looks like a 10th generation Honda Accord
Insane!!!!
The front is just a mazda
Ok the rear is so lazy of you Aston Martin
20:30 You dont put your ashes there, but ashes from a cigarette 😂
is it me or does it look cheaper in matte black
Exterior, I agree! No words. But after seeing your LC500 Convertible video, no modern car has better and/or original looking dashboard/center-console area than that (to me) with a really few exceptions, like  today's Bugatti models. This is nice too but has a lot of black plastic around the buttons, climate control area, etc. But this applies to today's Rolls and Bentleys too, I dont like their boring interior. The LC500 really surprised me with it's very stylish and nice dashboard https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cb/5b/c1/cb5bc1da577560d437e6e3539bd791e0.jpg
Phoebe Buffay: I'll give you 10 dollars for this
For a million dollars you shouldn't bend down just to put gas super trash why is doug not ripping this car apart that dealership probably giving him a commission when they sell that car 😂😂
The way he says Laganda Tarrrraafff🤣🤣🤣
U must be so stupid to buy that ugly crap instead of grabbing Two RR long wheelies, i m not surpriced AML close to going bancrupt once again soon
Why is he saying "its the most luxurious..." Doesnt even come close to the Maybach or the  Phantom.
Those might be the best looking trunk hinges I've ever seen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUmjYkODF3Y?t=22m
No matter how many times you say “Lagonda Taraf”, gorgeous, or beauty, even if you try to make it sound luxurious, it’s not going to make it worth the million dollars. It rather makes you sound pretentious and like a sell out. Better luck next time, Doug.
"تَـــرَفْ" Lagonda
I don’t know why but I just love that’s available in Europe and Asia but not in America
Doug Score at its best.  *looks like an Audi combined with a Peugeot 508:* 10/10 Styling  *has a million Dollars in luxury:* 5/10 Features 😂
“Sneer at a Rolls Roy’s” from the car which has no personality whatsoever. I love Astons, but this one is just another Rapide on viagra with the butt from Dodge Charger and a badge from the luxury company to excuse its enormous price tag.
Damn the same infotainment system from the old gen Aston? That’s a big Nono for me
23:20 when you realize that David Bowie was the final inspector of your car...
Doug: tells about bang and olufsun sound system Me: wait i have same brand speakers on my laptop Also me: so my laptop is worth 1 million dollars??
This car is more than 2X the cost of my *HOME* LMAO
You can’t put a price on class,style & good taste. So many car manufacturers( & people ) think that stuffing  a car with every conceivable electronic gadget means it’s luxurious or special,it does not.
The ceiling leather better be nice since it doesn’t have a panoramic sunroof which I would expect for $1M
You definitely sound like they paid you to drool all over this hot mess of a car. $1 million for this nonsense? Excessive capitalism is a trip. The new Mercedes C class looks better than this. It really looks like a generic video game car and you want us to believe you adore this car. 🤣
Aston Martin: We'll produce just 120 of these.  Me: As if you would have sold any more if you had produced any more :/
You pay over a mil and don't even get privacy glass wich you can get in....a Golf
Damn I was finna buy one but then I saw that it only got a DougScoreTM of 66... I guess I'm getting a civic
It looks like a ford fusion for a million dollars smh
Can’t wait for the lamborgini centanario review
Who would pay 1 million dollars for a rapide with a different styling? To me it doesn't even look that beautiful. It looks like a Kia or a genesis
Doug "dirty knees" DeMuro strikes again 🤭🤭
From the back it looks like Paragon R from GTA 5
just buy an RR phantom
Doug I love your videos and especially your car enthusiasm, but this is Far and Away the biggest disappointment in terms of just absolutely nothing special about this car except for its price tag. Beauty is in the eye beholder and I don't think it's attractive , but that's subjective. the features you talked about look very dated. Very surprised to see a dot matrix display on the dashboard and anything less then high definition LED. I normally don't comment on your videos but this one was absolutely horrible in terms of you stating how great this car is when it is really just a basic sedan with a big engine and lot of leather.
A million bucks and I can't make babies in the back seat? God bless Lincoln and Cadillac! Baby making AND room in the trunk for a couple bodies!
i'm arabic and this is the second time i heard this word after of course the first video you made about it :)
What's with the dislikes lol
Only doug would make a  commercial for families about worlds most expensive sedan.
Bmw e38 looks nicer imo. Like one guy pointed out this just looks like a gta car lol
That name sounds like that car is from a different planet lol
i watching you a lot i try to improve my english  one question please where is place ?
Really crap car. Ford and Aston Martin looks same.
0:55
Looks like a lincoln concept in the back. A Ford focus concept on the front.
Did this guy just use Laganda, Taraf and Ford, Taurus in the same sentence? Kick him in the nuts, please! That's just unforgivable!
Wow.. you must have literally zero interest in cars to spend $1,000,000 on this, it's just a re-packaged Rapide. Also.. just like the USA, we use MPH for cars in the United Kingdom. Although we also drive in miles, cycle/run in kilometres, measure TV's in inches, buy fuel in litres, weigh your self in stone, buy soft drinks in litres, beer in pints, milk in both!! Definitely not like the rest of Europe who just use Metric, or America who just use Imperial.
looks like a hyundai
The front kinda looks like a Honda Accord
If this thing is worth 1 Million Dollars,  My friends VW Arteon is worth 10 Million lol
Citroen an economy brand:has a luxury subdivision/brand Seat an economy brand: has a luxury subdivision/ separate brand Aston martin, a luxury car brand : has a separate luxury car brand 🤔
Honestly beauty really is subjective, I find this car very ugly and it looks like the design was straight up copied from a GTA V car, even the interior isn´t that special, not to mention the tech in the front (not just the main screen but also all the small, plastic buttons everywhere, the tachometer, etc...). This car makes a Maybach S650 (which starts at 200.000$) look like a bargain, specially considering that it looks WAY better.
Strange they didn’t ask Garmin for a modified Aviation GPS system, they do amazing software customisation of the systems and a $10k price tag would easily fix in the options list (and most of the customers would have them in their Private Jets)
Would not even pay a 100 grand for it. What a terrible car.
For some markets the interior colour was named "Fudge Fiasco," for others it was "Caramel Calamity." Same for the new DBX.
It looks nice but I don’t think it’s worth 1 million. Better off getting the rapide
This car is barely worth 300,000$
Looks like somebody received some free Aston Martin t shirts. Seriously... he talks about that car like it was the Mona Lisa...
Just a slightly more expensive ford fusion
0.25x playback speed 0:00-0:15
This car seems like a bad joke. Heated seats? iPad holders?
anyone else think it looks like a honda accord or dodge charger? u can save literally a million bucks.
- huge gap between the b-pillar and front door on a million-dollar car and no-one bats an eye - milimeter gaps on the bodywork of a $50k tesla and everybody loses their mind  doug should've used the "toothpaste" measurement, i believe it would fit
my $50k 2017 BMW 7 series has more features than this
Я как владелец маленькой игровой студии получил очень приятное впечатление от текстур и расцветок салона и двигателя.  Да и Роберт Демуро  как всегда на высоте. Прекрасный обзор.
Nice A.M.
You're welcome...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX_k6NIUuf8
Its luxurious...😉
It looks lonnnggg....!!!! 😂🤣
I never heard of it...🤔💭
Looks like a Volvo Polestar had an affair with a Dodge Charger
so next video is a lambo centenario right ?
Really doug... is this car worth a million doller.. I watch your channel because your very specific and truthfull about your review... now i think you getting bribed... Rolls Royce is 100 times better than this car...
Who would get this over a RR?
It's just like the massacro sports car from GTA V lol
Almost looks like a genesis from head on. Not worth la Ferrari money 🤦‍♂️
Wow. 2018 $1.000.000 car doesn't have push button closing trunk and garmin nav that looks like it was designed in 2008. And look at the gear indicator here 18:57 . It's like 6 pixels. That's pre-2000! Ridiculous. It is beautiful from the outside though...
Ugly front license plate bracket. 🤦🏼‍♂️
They could have cast the engine block with the Lagonda wordmark, really
The most expensive Ford Fusion in the world
this is the perfect car for joker
i know it is only me, but if i had 1 mill i would rather buy an RV with identical trailer
The air vents really should have been custom. CNCd of course from solid aluminium
Post malone has a 1M watch ..let that sink in
There needs to be a convertible version
Taraf means luxury in Arabic, and this car was aimed at the middle eastern market where  people would buy a thing with the highest price even if it looks like shit
Ребят если у вас есть дети вы тоже можете открыть несколько интернет проектов купить ребенку сервер и устроить вашу сына или дочь . В Массачусетский институт mit dot edu И у вас все получится и к тому же обучая вашего ребенка вы сможете предложить несколько концертов  бренду и купить себе этот шедевр.
That centenario's paint job... 👌🏾👌🏾
Did anyone else notice the fail on 10:03 ? 😂
Millionaires can be dumb at time... very dumb indeed! 😄
Where are the window buttons ????
Waiting for that centenario vid👀👀
at that price it better have soft close
Million dollar luxury car w no sunroof or convertible roof? 😂
... the belt buckles have foreskin
Надеюсь я смогу купить дочери или сыну. Немного позже. Бюджет проекта вроде позволяет маленькие покупки. Но не все сразу.
https://youtu.be/9S0xQWd3SwY
I don’t know. Sounds like the worst spent 1,000,000$
That is a beautiful looking automobile
I dunno but it resembles Quartz Regalia a bit
This is my dream car. Extremely beautiful, impressive technology, and the exclusive lagonda brand.  The first thing I’ll do if I have this car is to sell it and buy a fully loaded 7 series and put the rest of the money in the bank.
total rip-off
This car ain’t worth no 1 million Rose Royce is better than this
1 million, still a shity black steering wheel, they still cant figure out how to make that the interiour colour, like my  200$ shitbox c class....
Top line S Class Mercedes is much nicer.  Only in the “oil countries” would this car have a chance at selling.  Most basic $1 million car ever made and it looks like a Lincoln.
$300k would be much more reasonable.
The car is nice but it can't be the most beautiful.  Not in that color (subjectively). Not with that keyholes on the doors. Not with that plastic bars separating the fixed and the moving windows on the doors. Not with asymetric brake rotors slots. (Right ones slots face forward and left ones slots face backwards). Not with that massive AIRBAG plaque on the doors. Not full of Ford Focus parts.  The million dollar price tag is entirely for the exclusivity but given that price they could've make an effort in resolving many small deatils and make it truly beautiful.  It's a shame, the car isn't the best executed, nor the most luxurious (S-Class, Flying Spur or Phantom are much better at providing luxury), neither the best performer (although it isn't the purpose)... The design... meh. The windshield looks too much tilted to me and it gets worse compared to the back window tilt,  that C pillars are hideous, the front looks like if a Ford Mondeo and a Honda had a baby...  Also how can the charge $1.000.000 and not giving you an electric trunk door mechanism...  The car is elegant as any Aston Martin but it's just for making easy money from the rich middle east people that will buy it for its exclusivity over anything and it clearly shows.
FYI taraf in Arabic means luxury.
One million dollars and you don't even get a sunroof. A Lexus LS430 UL is better equipped than this thing.
And so the car is dependent upon the windows cracking open for door opening and closing, because the glass may break if it doesn’t, right? And so in our cold, northeastern winters when your windows freeze after your car has sat outside all day (and believe me, you’ll break a worm gear if you even so much as attempt to roll down a window), then the window glass will break or the door might not even openable at all, right? That’s an immediate deal killer on this or any car that does that.
I like the look of the Rapide more compared to this. For me the 2000s  Aston Martins are the most beautiful cars of the period.  The Vantage, DB9, Vanquish, but not this.
DOUG IS IN THE GERMAN TRENDS!
Not beautiful sorry
Grill looks like the new Hyundai Sonata lol
it worths shit
Why the front end got the Mazda design language
Ant eater 😭😭😭😭😭
So you pay a million bucks for the ugly version of an  Aston Martin
Picking jaw off floor.
Oof a Rolls Royce phantom with basic option cost 2.5m USD in my country, if this car exist in my country can’t imagine the price tag
10:03. Hahahahaha, apparently the doors don't stay at that angle.
I would rather have a rolls royce and have a million dollars instead of that thing 😅
this shit is not worth even half
An exclusivity-brainwash con for the ultra wealthy suckers. A get-rich quick scheme from Aston Martin.
The trunk is electric in my Kia Sorento with 30k this taraf dont have it 😂😂😂😂😂
1 M $ !!! I do not think so i could not find any feature worthy ,, if i have such money , i will buy a Bentley or Mercedes S65 , but this is just a waste of money ,,
Doug u trying too hard... THIISSSSS...aint it..
The rolls depreciate this wont hahah
Can't believe that they sold 140 of these. Just goes to show that rich people care more about style than substance...
I'll take the phantom and a 488 over this anyday
@5:16 he says pretty cool..  Money is also pretty cool bro.. 🤣🤣
looks like a luxury ford fusion
What's the blue car at the start?
I feel like a lot of the people in these comments don't have the 10 figure net worth that would allow them to see the "Beauty" that this car has to offer....... LMFAOOOOO
Apart from price and Rarity this car is no where near the luxury realm of Rolls Royce. Period.
The thing holding the door in place is obviously pneumatic not hydraulic. You can even hear the air at the end of the clip... come on Doug
please review an oiginal s13 silvia
Lamborghini Centenario review is coming.
Long story shot: 1. Not worth the 1 million mark 2. Not even close to RR in terms almost everything 😅😅😅😅
This is not worth a million lmao
Looks like a million dollars Ford Taurus
"They've made 120 of these for entire planet"...hahaha Like everyone is about to get one of these😂😂😂
seriously this is the first video that makes me question whether doug was paid to make this video. His critique is waaayyy more forgiving and non-sarcastic than for literally any other car. And he's praising everything waaayyy too much.
I’m sorry but this isn’t worth 1 million. Rolls Royce is better in just about every way at half the price.
Garman navigation mor like garbage navigation
Doug explicitly wants you to know that this is.....a MILLION DOLLAR CAR
1 million dollars but the interior comes directly from Aston's parts-bin. That is unacceptable at that price.
1. Its ugly! 2. thats like the 800th time you uses ,,........ is the most expensive luxury sedan''  3. i hope everyone who was dumb enough to spend 1mio on that shit goes broke. 4. Wish you all a nice day! 5. WTF why has it tuning signals in the front headlights? 7:00 as if its wasn't ugly enough 🤣 6: 10:03 FAIL HAHAHA
This is one of those cars that are stupidly overpriced
Excellent for the rich man of fashion. If I have the money (which I don't), I'd still settle for a fully loaded S-class.
$1M, no sunroof, no cup holder...
Remember the exchange rate lol, it is a currency 3.5x more powerful than the USD. Making this car 285k USD equivalent for people in these countries.
i like the fact that ppl hated this thing just bcuz it was made for the middle east/arabs lol  the same ppl that liked the lambo reventon which is a lp640 with a different body
That car is ass ugly..
1M$ car,  but not a 1M$ haircut
The Lagonda name does come from a company that Aston bought the late 40’s. That company was started by an American guy named Wilbur Gunn, who was an Opera singer living in the UK. The name Lagonda comes from the street he lived on in Springfield, Ohio. The street was named after the Shawnee Native-American settlement, which they called ‘Lagonda’.
For the million dollar price of this car, you can buy FOUR brand new other Aston Martin cars!   FOUR!   The DBS, the DB-11, the Vantage, and the new DBX SUV!   So I don’t think it’s worth spending a million dollars on this one!   It just doesn’t really have enough uniqueness to warrant that price tag!   No.   It’s actually ridiculous.  I guess the only single reason you would spend that kind of money on this one is for the extremely limited run.  The exclusiveness.  That’s it!
26:08 what is he talking about? Isn't it a ZF 8 speed automatic?
God. it's so pretty
Embarrassing for 1 million 🙄🤦🏻‍♂️
ONE....MILLLLLION........DOLLARS!!! 🤔
Oh well..  sad to see one of the more amusing car channels in YT has finally become a sell-out. The original Doug Demuro would have absolutely roasted this car but alas money & commissions speak louder.
So it was made for the middle east huh. Then probably about 48 of these were made for the sultan of Brunei....as eetates, with built in swimming pools....
yea... rolls royce still luxurier than that
Every time you fill up your car with fuel, you're paying a few pennies towards the cost of one of these cars sitting in the garage of some fat oil sheik. 11:46 That leather strip is unacceptably ruched!
The front looks like an Australian FG X ford falcon , doesnt seem like a million $ design
Skinny guy wearing two T-shirts alone with a $1 million Aston Martin in a deserted car park. Is this a car-jacker's dream?
Id rather buy a lexus that costs less has more tec and will last
1 million$ seems quite a bit over priced 🤔
Doug: Take a look at the DB9 grille Also Doug: Shows Aston Martin Virage
Beautiful car but the rear lights are generic Aston and don't live up to the rest of it. Doug is like an American wandering around Toronto and being amazed at the Canadian flags - it's "technically a Lagonda" because it IS a Lagonda!!
100-150k, max. And it still would be overpriced. Not even close to a fully equiped S Class, Bmw 7 series, or the Panamera.
This car is not even worth $200,000
Actually the tail lights red leds stay on during turn signal they just have orange leds offset by about 0.5cm that are way brighter, you can see it on the video.
GTA 5 be like: Nah 1.2 million for Honda Civic
I hate it when the turn signals are on the inside of the headlights instead of the outer edges. They are harder to spot them that way
Its excruciating to see crappy and outdated bits in a million dollar car.
Drinking game: Take a shot everytime Doug sais "aaand".
Kinda funny how Lagonda Taraf rhymes with big fucking rip off
I see Centenario in CB ad, realising review is coming. My jaw: "I'm out"
So this is how a very bad and ridiculous investment looks like! It would have been interesting to hear how much value they've lost so far... 80%? 90%? AM may have got in a decent amount of cash, but I think this is harming the brand in the long run... No one wants to be the laughing stock of the bunch, having bought an grossly overpriced and underspec'd vehicle...
Gamera is what I'd put my money in. It's got everything
One million dollars and it doesn’t come with the latest iPads lol
That trunk is too short ✌
Quite sad to see a 1mil car which is the same as a 100k car
Ford Focus Mk1 looks far better than this shit.
A luxurious, muscle car lookalike, with a price tag of 1,000,000. Only thing positive is the leg-room.
A million dollar car with common looking rims...🤔🙄😋
I'd be livid if you'd put childs in the back ahahah
Where is the "paid product placement" annotation? Because this is clearly a biased review with ZERO credibility. Doug, you are on a slippery slope if you continue doing videos like this one. Downvote.
22:10 my 2002 renault velsatis 3.5 can do the same  and i bought it for 2000$
Very interesting. Keep up the good work Doug.
Doug is the type of guy who drives a million dollars car in a T-SHIRT & SHORT
This car is royal blue would have been glorious. Instead it's in douche matte black.
Doug was the type of guy to remind the teacher to assign homework
MY GOD IN HEAVEN....
My Ford Mondeo has a capless fuel filler.
Reminds me of the revolter in gta
I'm sure it's all very well made ...but there are so many features missing... with every s class from that time you are better on the road
That glass on the pillar is shit, should have had the front and back windows extend out enough to cover the pillar. That would have been luxury, not some shitty piece of glass glued in place.
*THIS* Is an Aston Martin Rapide. It just looks better from the outside and costs ten times more.
$1,000,000 and comes with a $100 garmin satnav. ROFLMAO
Garmin navigation,ford turn signals and that steering wheel... That shows they don't have respect for their buyers and this is just trickery to fool  pretentious middle eastern sheiks.I really thought this was going to be a special car.Turns out Aston Martin is just trying to make a few bucks.
Junk !!!
One of those cars whose sole purpose is to lighten the wallets of the dumb rich.
It’s so unique 😍
So, WHY IS IT HERE??
This car is so ugly
This video feels more like an ad than a review.
Arab oil barons will buy any crap for any money, provided you slap a premium label on it. You should see the tacky shit that sells for hundreds or thousands on Edgware Road (Arab quarter) in London.
Lamborghini Centenario review in the next episode?
forget about comparing this to a Rolls Royce or Bentley, hell this over expensive piece of shit car is not even on the level of s class, 7 series or A8. It looks like flat face doug is paid to sell the car that's why he is portraying it as ultra luxurious or some shit whereas is reality any Lexus or even a genesis g80 is much better than this crap.
I'm cringing at the idea of a plastic booster seat creasing the leather seats in the back
those backlights and thick back pillar almost make it look like a dodge challenger, they should have added a smoked glass panel & Hofmeister kink
This car looks like 40-50k price sticker not 1 million...someone stupid can pay 1 million for this car...
Is this the ugliest Aston ever made?
So what else is "Lagonda" making? I think AM was confused when when decided to make the car. The Rapide looks much better and if they wanted to build on some popularity of the old Lagonda in the middle east, they could've made a Lagonda edition of the Rapide. And make it a line that they can use later on the DBX. That'd possibly sell in the middle East. But this thing can't fool anyone, even not in the middle east. Unless it has like 800k worth of diamonds or something. I'd go for a RR Ghost/ Wraith- Black badge if I'm driving.  Not a phantom.
Lots of the features he sounds like he's really excited about you can find on a 30k car lol
I watched the whole video waiting for the moment you would say "Just kidding! this car is a complete fail and isn't worth half as much as it is being sold for" Instead you just kept talking about the stiching...why Doug, why??
Hmmm this score seems a little bloated
This is a stupid car. Not worth it.
Anyone else think it has some KIA design language? Like it’s obviously nicer but if you told me this is the Hyundai version of the Stinger I’d be like yeah makes sense haha
I liked Aston Martin as a kinda slick sedan or coupe but this car looks pretty damn nice.
it’s so ugly
Whoever is reading this, God has a plan trust the process.🙏🙏🙏
ugly can be expensive too
The headlights look like a Honda Accord
I guess this is one of the reasons that AML needs the DBX to be the "saviour of the company", which it might well be. They've made so many baffling decisions in the last 10-15 years, it's amazing that they're still going. This seems to be a simple case of knowing that certain people would pay a ridiculous price for the exclusivity alone, even if the luxury/quality wasn't much higher than a typical Aston. Clearly, they spent next to nothing on development compared to how much the Valkyrie must have cost them.
the best looking sedan? you’re a joke lol
What an ugly looking car, not worth 1 million, scrap it right away
Hi Doug do you really like this car that much or did they pay you to lie to your viewership? There needs to be some transparency here if it turns out that the whole thing was just an ad
I would rather buy a Phantom         Yea i m poor😓
That's one seriously average looking car....
This is totally Mazdas Design. Just take a look at the new models.
Top 7 https://youtu.be/xeejiWkErwM
Aston Martin:  It's called Lagonda Koenigsegg:  Hold my skål
For million bucks i would rather have Phantom "the head turner" AND a Maybach "real luxury and comfort"
Meh! - A Phantom here in Australia is 1.1million new...B&O sound !? cheap shit! where's the Linn or Naim system? Ford turn signal lever? OMG! This is what happens when car manufacturers chase a single market. And what a CRAP market!
Why do Doug look like a older version of Fred Savage from a episode of the Wounder Years,
Looks like a honda accord from the front and acura nsx from the back. id rather take a RR
I get it, the refrigerator option is $900,000....
Taraf in arabic translates to "tip" or "side" Edit: Can't believe this piece of junk is $1m.
Sometimes I wonder, these are great cars indeed, but how can it possibly be that expensive
The front end looks more like a Dodge Charger. 🤨
It looks like an Arabian concept car.
Imagine paying a 1mil for a Mazda 6 look alike
I feel sorry for the cows that died for this abomination
Taraf in Arabic means extreme luxury as you said as well as abundant and excessive wealth. Well named for the targeted buyers
Basically you're paying One Mill just for "Lagonda" logos inside and all over the car
I think the guys at Aston Martin thought to themselves "where in the world can we find a few idiots with more money than sense"  The technology in this car is a fucking joke.
I dont get why fridges in those luxury cars are always so ugly. Just put some leather on it or  make it metal. If you're going to pay 1mil for it.  Edit: just saw that they even leatherized the seatbelt locks hahaha
Interior is so basic and dated... $1m really??
Doug you’re the man and all but you need to give us better angles of these beautiful cars please
Just wow. What a ripoff. A pretty one though
Front end makes think it’s the love child of a Nissan Altima and a Ford Fusion
What did gta 5 make this and set the price
this isn’t even worth 100k
The 6 series gran coupe is the best looking 4 door car ever
POS

Doug des moureaux
I imagine buying this $1mill car, discovering it has less functionality than my Kia.
Rolls-Royce Phantom: absolutely loaded with insane luxury and comfort equipment, beautiful interior design, unmatched presence, costs $600,000.  Lagonda Taraf: has lots of dead animal skin, costs $1,000,000.
Drove an Aston Martin V8 (2014)Vantage recently. Couldn't wait to get back into my 2018 BMW 330i. Astons are pretty, but not as good as the best from Germany (or Italy). Unfortunately.
Doug: can't really get over the apparent beauty of the car Me: dunno, would've thought it's some Hyundai Genesis
Betcha Sultan of Brunei has already turned his into a shooting brake
Damn that Lambo looks good
Lmao the rear end is the worst part of the design imo, looks like a weird underbite and just not the best design or detail
Doug the type of guy to refer to a 2018 car as "a car from this era"
Lmao definitely not worth a milli! Doug was definitely paid to speak so polite about this, maybe to attract a buyer or something cos I’ve seen Doug go innn on cars with poor tech & minimal options, this shouldn’t be an exception!
This car looks like it will not age very well at all. And it really dont look like 1M car at all.
That back window angle coming down just doesn’t match with the front, it doesn’t work for me
Possibly the greatest rip-off in automotive history.
This car is horrible. The roof line is disgusting and the front kills the Aston Martin aesthetic.
Not an attractive vehicle
Thith...
I'd rather have a loaded  S-class, a GTC 4 Lusso,  an M3 daily driver,  and a half-million in cash. But hey, that's me.
it looks like VW KIA hybrid...not worth money.
1M $ Ford Mondeo
This is a 1 million dollar version of the Ghibli.  But Doug is oddly in love with this car....
For a million dollars i better be able to go all electric with 500 miles or hyrdogen powered  otherwise keep it 😂
Didn’t know the Doug DeMuro fan base was so toxic and rude.   I’m unsubbing
Im ngl. I think this thing looks awful... the lines look very inconsistent as they run down the car
why does it look like a little bit nicer ford fusion... lol
gta car
Even my 36000$ BMW 320d has power operated trunk
I'm not upset that they've taken the turn signal stock for my Ford Mondeo out of the Lagonda. It's a budget car and they have to cut costs somewhere.
The front end is too Mazda for my tastes
This car is trash...certainly not worth a million bucks...not even half.
a Phantom is 100% more beautiful n 100% more worth it for close to half the price lmfao
From the taraf 😁😁😁😁😁
Nice but not worth 1 Million USD though...
No Aston logos on the vehicle but sure that engine bay is brimming with Ford part numbers !
Beautiful? It seems a Ford Mondeo after a crush!
Bullshit. It worths may be 250.000 max. 1 million is a joke...
people actually pay for this car?!?!
I'd just stick to the rolls Royce phantom in terms of expensive black cars tbh
looks ugly
look more like 200,000$ car and
I would rather have the BMW 760Li than this. 900.000$ for being Aston Martin 🤣
Taraf in Arabic means luxury 😁
Yuck
I will build a car from scrap materials, call it an unusual name, say that there is no such car in the world, and I will sell it for 10 million dollars
Most biased review ever. This shouldn't cost more than 110k...
Best looking? Homeboy, you trippin'.
In 5 years, it will sell for $70,000
Bruh
It do be lookin like my mother's Malibu tho
Quick question: If you were going to Las Vegas from Friday to Sunday... Do you wear your better outfit Friday night or Saturday night ??
🤣😂🤣😂 This should be insulting to the people in the middle eastern market! The contempt of this vehicle. اعذرني يا شاب العربي الرائع كيف تريدين تلميع برازك؟  مقابل مليون دولار ، يمكننا حتى أن نلبسها من الألمنيوم والكروم والجلود المدبوغة آليًا!  Excuse my fine Arab chap, how would you like your feces polished? For a million dollars we can even clad it in aluminum and chrome tanned machine stitched leather!
the car looks really ugly though imo , i think doug is biased bcuz he is an aston fanboy. tbh some aston’s looks gorgeous but not this one, and the price tag with this look make it even worse.
This car is the biggest scam of the century
value should be 1/10 LMAO
Looks like a typical Audi R8 without the rings
no ventilated seats in a $1m luxury sedan... REALLY?!?!
This car is definitely for sale on Doug’s website and he’s definitely getting a fact chunk of the sales price.. this car is no where near as interesting as he’s making it seem.
I do believe it's the ashtray made of unobtanium that skyrockets the price
It looks like a car that belongs in GTA V
Completely agree that this car isn't worth anything like $1 million, but lots of older cars which are rare are now worth loads but on paper, they are out performed by a hot BMW today. Aston basically manufactured value by building very few, same as supercar companies regularly do (add a little bit of performance and carbon fibre, tweak the styling, quadruple the price, or things like the reventon which is just a murcielago with a body kit). And, they got away with it, because keeping up with the jones' is what's its about at that level, it's not about having the best car, but by having an expensive car you show you have more money than those with a phantom (which you also have already). It's a shame Aston didn't make more effort to set this apart, as having the unique styling would have made this something really special, but it's turned into a rebody of a rapide basically.
Clearly was made for the mid-east, only requirement there is that it is stupidly expensive. Mind you, I really wonder if Doug is high, this ain't even comparable to a base model Rolls.
Sometimes I think if it weren't for the Middle East oil trade then hyper/supercar and luxury car manufacturers wouldn't exist.
The front looks like a rich version of the Hyundai Sonata
I will buy it... When it depreciates in 40 years to match my savings.
Great vid as always but really don’t like it and for a Million, no way
This was actually made to make the Rolls Royce Phantom so much cheaper and better value for money🤑😂
If you want to pay 1 mil for a rare car be my guest but this car should have never been priced anywhere close to 1 mil in the first place.  Maybe $300 k, maybe.
Man this guy talks a lot!
a waste of money. i think that is why bentley and rolls royce are winning, there are not far behind from VW and MERCEDES
Day 10029 of me, watching Doug reviewing a car i ll never have :)
The price is what it is simply to make this car a status symbol... Aston martin makes some beautiful cars, this one certainly isn't the best they've done...
Priced like it’s a car from new GTA updates.
Aston Martin has a "LUXURY" brand
This is a 2018 vehicle what exactly does “at the time” even mean? Like, they could’ve gone with ANYTHING at the time that was not that navigation system.
10:42 Doug experience having sex in the back of the lagonda😂😂
For a million dollar car, it just seems really boring. Obviously I'm not in the 'target market', but who would want to buy something like this? If you had plenty of money to throw around, you could do much better for a lower price.
One question:  If this car was designed for the very wealthy in mostly Arab countries/nations; Why the hell does it have heated seats? A natural 114 degrees isn't hot enough anymore? Lol 🤷‍♀️
All the big money you pay is just for that Leather roof liner and Leather seats with holes in between. Rest all is just a car. Shocked to see that they didn't wrap the key fab with leather
In Australia, a Rolls Phantom is $1.1m :(
Big pharmaceutical companies should get into the middle east luxury sedan market.
Its shit when u just got a car wash and u open the door and the windows roll down and ruin it
Turath means legacy in arabic.. not ultimate luxury
i seriously want to be that kid
The Audi A8 exists but the A8L isn't $1 million dollars.. so if the Aston Rapide exists then how the hell can these bastards charge THAT much more for a a slightly longer fucking car 😵  My brain is pulsing
So the idea was only sell it in the Middle East and then they give it a name in Arabic meaning "Ultimate Luxury"? I think the name sounds cool and works for the car - but I don't speak Arabic. In the middle east they do however so why give it that name if it was intended for them? That would be like The "Rolls Royce Ultimate Luxury" to an English-speaker - does that really sound nice?
The navigation unit really is a shame for this car. It looks very similar to the one in my mom's 2009 Peugeot or the one in the 2007 Mazda 6 I used to own, the navigation system of which came out in 2002.
You will be shocked how common are they to see here. I've seen almost 10 of them in a span of few days.
It's ultra rare, beautiful? Most beautiful luxury sedan?? c'mon Doug... 🏌🏿‍♂️
Looks literally like something stright out of gta
The front kinda reminds me of the VW T-Roc.....
Wow!!!! a giant ford fusion 😂😂😂
10:02 It doesn't stay LMAO
l'd still take a phantom 8 over this anyday,
Absolute stupid if you compare with those around the exact same price range
Sounds like a nice car if you compare with the 100k range
Oh great to have an umbrella handy.. in the trunk
there are very less reviewers who sit on their knees just to open the door.
Rebadged Rapide with an updated transmission and a hideously pumped up price.
How cheap you are? 3.7m subscribers and you don't wanna pay someone for production to fix your trash audio? Damn man invest in your business
Absurd price. Moronic
Ugly thing. Rarity is what it has. Seen one on sale for $435,000.
sorry but the only car i could think of while looking at the front of this is the Volkswagen Arteon, inside it is Focus turn signal stocks, I just don't see this being better than a Rapide :D
A Rolls Royce is arguably better, because other people will know you are driving a Rolls, and not some random sedan
Take shot everytime he says "a million dollar"
Interior isn’t worth $50000
The baddest car design I’ve ever seen.
This ain't beautiful sorry. For that kind of money I would buy a 2020 Camry XSE fully loaded, a 2012 Porsche GT3, and a nice half million dollar home and still have money leftover to invest and also to travel the world
I’ll have 2 Phantoms please.
THIS CAR IS TRASH!!! they made it so expensive just to say it‘s the most expensive sedan! stupid company
No ventilated seats? LOLLLL
that's an accord
Just skip to 3:30
BEST looking sedan ever? What kind of bias is this?  This thing is definitely not worth 1 million. It's basically just an ordinary luxury sedan, but marked up to 1 million due to exclusivity.
This is one of the ugliest things I've ever seen
That wrinkles on leather on the roof, this car should cost $150.000 NEW, not a chance to beat RR.
That must be the most overpriced car ever , navigation looks like it's from 2010.
Guys looks like a centunario review is coming
But it looks like a fusion from the front
Aston Martin product planner: "Okay, hear me out. Want a quick $120 million? All we need to do is take a Rapide and put a really pretty body and interior on it, because rich Arabs will buy anything exclusive and beautiful. It doesn't even need a full set of modern features. We can do it again in a few years when Honda copies the front end design and the Arabs want something unique to replace it. This is how how capitalists redistribute wealth from the billionaire class."   It really is beautiful, though.
Looks like a 1st gen R8 from the front.
Lol I love how at the end he assumes no one watching this has a million dollars lol I do bro but who tf is gonna buy this car for a mill ... i can buy 4 super cars!!!... ill stick to my mercedes 😊
Ugly af, no wonder it was made for the middle east market. Those rich arabs have no taste when it comes to cars.
Doug the type of guy to find the Accord Ultimate Edition absolutely beautiful.
Thats a bargain
Nothing about this car is worth 1 mill😂 I’d rather buy a rolls Royce, g wagon, and Ferrari for less money lmao
Sadly this doesn't feel as special on the inside as a RR Ghost, atleast on video.
I'm i the only one that thinks this car is not worth the price???  I mean mercedes s class shits on this car ... and its not a million dollars... btw love your work man love the way you go into detail !!! 👏 👏 👏 👏
750 thousand dollar trim package
How the hell this car looks so ugly and cheap ,,, except leather ouch thats ugly wtf aston ?
Aston Martin continues ripping off people, but this is on another level. The back part of the interior is so tight it's claustrophobic. It's more like sports car with more leg room. It's like they told Doug what he has to say if he wants to review it.
You mean that's not a Ford Fusion grill?
It looks like a car from the nineties. Only a fool who doesn't know the value of money can buy this car.
How is a capless fuel filler a feature for a ONE MILLION DOLLAR car in 2018?
This YouTube’s channels best video ever. Great work Doug. I’ve been following you since the Jalopnik days and I’m proud to have been on this ride with you. Keep it up.
Ridiculous price and looks as well. Would by Rolls and House instead
Doug must have got paid by O'gara to help them sell this RIDICULOUSLY overpriced Rapide. It's the only way i can explain how he can find surprising all the things that you can find on other Aston Martins from that era. Lagonda should be a couch building brand but this is just a new body sticked on already existing platform, fitted with already existing interior design and charging to some wealthy douchebag one million quid.  BTW..that grill foto et the beginning is of the DBS not db9.
Its simple and elegant, minimalist and sweeping design. Its beautiful. Its like a muscle car but ripped instead of muscular.
Congratulations on being able to show us this very exclusive and IMHO beautiful car, these kinds of cars is why I watch this channel most !
Shit spec worth only 100 000
Is it just me ? this car looks like a regular car and looks like parts joined to put it together, the trunk and rear light looks like the XF Jaguar. and front like front design the Audi RR... $1m ? I will pick a tesla over it....and save the rest
It doesn't even come close to Bentleys or Rolls-Royces. I reckon its mere purpose is to ripoff dumb people who has too much money to spend.
I think I speak for all of us when I say that i'm devestated you didn't name your auctions website Quirks&Features.com
He was wayyy to nice on this thing 🤣
That’s a seriously beautiful vehicle 👍
very disappointed !!!!!!  i expect a hoenst review
Does it have power steering?
This is the metris of the luxury world... remember when doug would rip on overpriced cars and point out flaws instead of quickly brushing over it.  I'd buy a phantom 100 times over before this car.
Ugliest Aston Martin since....
This car isn’t even that beautiful
I have seen it once in Riyadh, a green one, I spent couple of minutes around it, and I can tell you, it’s NOT that beautiful, it’s just normal for the price , and weirdly shaped.
It comes with a DOT MATRIX SCREEEENN AWESOMEEEEE LOLOL
To be honest the exterior design theme is from the old Lagonda mixed with newer and future Aston Martin models, which I think is brilliant both as a concept and as a result
Doug, you should have put the other lagonda in the dougscore chart!  I forgot what it scored, like 48 or something. But it's just such a nice thing to see how brands and cars evolve. Love ya.
No sane person will pay 1mil for this junk
That navigation is digusting
It’s a British car, the extra $850,000 is just from the extra doors, minus materials.
what a horrible car. gave video thumbsdown because of it :D since when is its luxurious to pull yourself out of the vechile by leather strap?!?!
It’s looking like a GTA V car.
Dongle on the pillar. I thought at first this was a window break escape hammer- Oh well, at least its magnetic to stop it clacking against your million dollar window at every bump and turn. Nice leather work and attention to detail otherwise.
If I'm paying $1 million for a luxury vehicle there's no way I'm dealing with plastic still. Everything in the interor should be CNC machined aluminium, leather,glass, crystal, or wood.
dunno why they'd make this shit when they had the rapide
Aston Martin had lost their mind ... ONE MILLION FOR THIS CRAP no WAY!!! Better get Bentley and couple of Panameras...
ugliest $1 million car.  Front half and back half don't match
Given how pathetic the dougscore is, previous videos and how much he talked about this cars gorgeously beautifully stunning styling, I was expecting he would give styling 6/10
What about the show and display title?  That's exactly what it sounds like. You can show it and display it but you ain't gonna drive it around town on a regular basis. Who in the world would buy a car like this for this price and not want to drive it on a regular basis?
I think the only reason its that expensive is because it more of a symbol piece than a car, more of a collectors item them a car. This is one of those things you park in your living room or art museum
It’s not beautiful especially from the side Doug
How much is Aston Martin paying you @Doug Demuro 😂
Za taką cenę w ogóle nie opłaca się. Nic tu nie ma co byłoby warte 1milion... Auto bez sensu... Aston zarobił na naiwności klientów
How come you are uploading so many boring cars so frequently? did you sell yourself to sponsors?
This car is rubbish for a million dollars. Why on earth someone with a right mind pay a million! Its so dated.
Maybe the drive gear selector & the doors lock/unlock buttons are positioned on the right hand side because Aston Martin is British company? 🤔They just changed the steering wheel placement to be on the left but didn’t bovver wif the rest (apologies for my terrible linguistic stereotyping😅).
I cant bare his voice or his stupid reviews
Doug must of bumped his head to think this is the all time most beautiful 4-door sedan, more than the Fisker Karma, or the classic x300/x308 Jaguar XJ, or a 1950s Cadillac, or 1940s Lincoln, etc. If we add concept cars to the mix, the Bugatti Galibier and Cadillac Sixteen make this Lagonda look provincial.
Looks like a Hyundai
These 120 Lagonda Tarafs are destined for collector garages, not to be driven around.
BMW E65 7 series from 2002 has the same type of design on the door hold.   Beautiful Lagonda, thanks for the review.
I thought he will say "the first British muscle car"
Native Arabic speaker here: If its name means ‘luxury,’ it should be pronounced ‘ta.ruff’ and not « ta.raaf ».
Dude that thing looks like a KIA and u gave 10 v 10 for styling? WTF
Wildly unimpressive car, for sure I'd rather get a Bentley regardless of the price. This car seems to be all about showing you have more money to splash than actually buying a better car than commoners with their RR's.
This car is from 2015 or 2016, probably 2016. It may not be legal to drive this car in The Netherlands because of its turning lights and lack of bumpers.
It looks like a car straight out of gta 5 😂
I think there is a car in GTA model after this. I never knew it was a real car.
Why does this look like Hyundai Genesis for 1mil
10:25 wtf that sounds like a piece of crap when you close the 1 million dollar door. Why didn't it squeak.. it so f funny... The cost is a million, but closing a door sounds like the cheapest used chinese car for less than a thousand. It's just hilarious. Are there really retarded idiots with millions of dollars?
too bad wasting a good exterior design with the interior rubbish infotainment system and driver console ... I wonder who is stupid enough to buy an obsolete technology car at this high price.
Looks like a Honda Accord from the front and tesla from the back.
Looks like the bmw i8 from the front
Aston probably hired the same designer from GTAV.
This looks like an accord, fusion, with a touch of camero from the back. You're over doing it on this one, Doug.  I seriously thought this was a 10yr old car until I looked it up. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Is the key cracked ?
Aston Martin: ✨swan hinge🧚‍♂️  My mind: is it just a cover up for poor build quality?🤔  😂
The front of this car looks like a Accord and the back looks like something off of GTA 😂
I give you 35,000 bucks
Looks like a really fancy Honda Accord
The most beautiful sedan with front from ford mondeo/fusion :P
this was made to fleece the Saudi billionaires and I'm ok with that.
Looks like a ford fusion from the front
Dude the Centenario teaser got me freaking out
So you spend 1 Melon Money on a car and still you have to bring your own iPads for the backseats. Seems legit.
This car unbelievably ugly
Strongly reminds me of a stretched 2004 Sebring.
That front end is the best looking sedan? I'll have what Doug's smoking.
Don't wealth shame me DeMuro.
Sorry Doug ,but BMW E38.. MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL than this 😏
This car seems like a scam lol
This looks like a sedan version of the cyber truck
This car deserves a review like the Mercedes Metris minivan from Doug. Why Doug, why?
10:25 - Those dirty knees in the $1 million Lagonda, dear God Doug - have a tissue to wipe'em off before you climb into a car, it doesn't take all that much extra space to carry around... Small wet towel in a plastic bag will do, too.
Agree on the beauty of this car 👍 btw, sorry again about your palm tree 🌴 🤙
Pay twice the cost for half the umbrellas
looks like a honda accord from the front to me 🤷🏽‍♂️
I would have bought a rolls
1.000.000? I would buy a Ford Fusion and spend the rest for cookie ice cream.
I hate how the rear window looks. Not that beautiful tbh. Maserati Quattroporte has the best looks hands down. Looks are subjective though
Let alone a phantom... An S63 or a 760Li would blow this Taraf out of the water. Saves $800k too to buy 2 more supercars.
If I heard that price at the dealership,  I would be la gone da out of there in an instant.  Smash a headlight and pay $50,000 for a replacement.
I came when I saw that aventador.... lewd scenes warning
Tell me which stupid would buy this and not a Phantom...
6ixnine finna cop this and son everybody 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
Id rather get a Rapide tbh, better looking, waaaay cheaper, and basically the same car..... then again i cant afford either
That color looks like unpainted plastic
10:00 "and it will stay exactly there no matter where you put it"  10:03: *Door closes by itself*  Doug: *Tries to hold the door*
When Doug is talking about the ash tray and says “You pop it open, put your ashes in it”, that wording got me thinking. Like, can you imagine the owner of a Taraf, or any luxury car with an ash tray big enough, being cremated and having their ashes kept in the ash tray of their car? It seems like the kind of thing at least one rich person has done.
I don't think anyone would compromise a Rolls-Royce for that rare million dollar makes much sense though to show off how rich you really are still look at the wheel like really come on men
It IIiiIISS, IIIIiiiIIN the car  Doug going through puberty
wow they put logos in a million dollar car!
A phantom ewb here costs 2M USD
This car has the vibe of an 120-130k dollar car (for 2018) and probably 50-60k today used
I would say that this is the ugliest AM I've seen, and it's not close. I typically consider them to be one of the most beautiful luxury brands, but this looks meh, like a mass production domestic. And the paint job is atrocious, looks like what you'd see someone do on a tricked out 90s Impala.
No adaptive cruise? Wtf
looks like a Mazda 6 from the front
Yeah, I’m just not seeing where they pull a 1mil price tag from.
I think I would need to see this car in person to understand this vehicles outer beauty. I do not feel like this car visually would earn a 10 and maybe gets a 7 or 8 but again, things in person can really change that. This is still a beautiful car and one in which if you want rarity and a lot to like it's an interesting choice, but when were talking what else you can buy that's a car for 1 million dollars, I would bet this would be pretty far down my list. Great review!
2 rolls Royce still looks a better option to me
Nice Accord
Not sure why Doug likes this car so much. It's cool just because it's a rare, expensive Aston. But I personally think it is kind of weird looking. Not necessarily ugly, but definitely not pretty either. So not good looking, not fast (compared to other ultra premium sedans), not particularly practical or reliable, no amazing features. If someone asked me the price I would have guessed ~$200k new.
It looks straight out of gta v
You went to London and didn't post any video?
"They covered the seatbelt clips so you don't have to look at the crappy plastic" 2 minutes later... *shows huge chunk of plastic Rapide switchgear*
Doug , your Kia stinger is a Better looking car than this
That must be the ugliest car I’ve ever seen in my life. On top of the $1Million dollar price tag, you get a Garmin for navigation and iPads in the rear seats?? Are you kidding me! I would pay no more than 30k for this thing. And that would be specifically for the V12.
I rather get the Range Rover Velar,this car is really out of my budget
I would rather have two Phantoms
They should be a shame with the infotainment system in such an expensive car
All that money and the windows aren't even tinted.
everything is "luxurious" when a 100k car costs a million
Dude that centanario looks clean af
It’s like a modern Mustang (front), and a modern Dodge Dart (rear), had a love child 👶
no sunroof ...no digital cluster...guess one would be  simply doing a million dollar charity
One of the ugliest sedans I have seen
Sweaty guy in a khaki short messes up  $1 million  leather interior
In romanian, taraf means traditional music crew with live instruments
My man Doug just gonna ignore the plastic air vents like that?
I’d pay more for a Nissan Altima than that car. This looks like a funeral car
the new GENESIS G80 IS GORGEOUS FOR THE MONEY .... THE 2021 MODEL.
Looks like a ford fusion
I would rather have 1 lambo and 1 ferrari if i had a million to burn
it's a good looking car but u really think that is the most beutiful 4 door hmmm that's your appenion not mine.  and a million usd no it's not worth that
A million dollars and no sunroof. My Mazda 3 is winning its own way 😂
Ugly
I bet they kept a 85% profit margin
This si the type of car, where they say in Aston Martin: we will price it 1. mill because there is for shure 120 people out there that will give this money for a car wort 1:3 of the price, so thay can say, my car costs a millon dollar. A proper oligarch type of car, the type, I have money and I use them to light my fireplace at home.
BRO. GREAT VIDEO, BUT I CAN'T STOP LOOKING AT YOUR HAIR!!! 🤣👍
The front is giving me ford focus vibes
The phantom is atleast 10 times better
Wow
Taraf in Arabic words: ترف
8:45 doug the type of guy to be on his knees while on concrete
Nothing really special about this car. I think Aston Martin charged $1Mil because they could. I'd pick a Rolls over this any-day.
This car is ugly🤮
I guess James Bond got tired of driving....
Cant wait to see this in no time to die
Doug 30 years later : THISSSSSSS issss a ASTON MARTIN Lagonda taraf and it is  Available in Cars and bids for 30,000 dollars and today I will show you Around show the quirks and features and tell you why it is the ultimate bargain of the century
50k ,take it or leave it
20 years from now it'll be a hoopty LOL!
I would definitely buy this than sell it for twice it’s price.
Doug in ten years: "This car. Has lost. $950k in value!!!! It's quite possibly. The worst depreciation I've ever seen. In my entire life."
Dear friend, Jesus Christ shows us the ultimate example of humility. God's Word tell us, "In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant" (Philippians 2 : 4-5).               Jesus demonstrated the greatest humidity of all. Though eternally with the Father, He chose to bend beneath the cross in love so that through His death He might lift any who recieve Him into the joy of His presence. We imitate Jesus humility when we seek to serve our Heavenly Father by serving others. Jesus's kindness helps us catch a breathtaking glimpse of the beauty of setting ourselves aside to attend to others' needs. Aiming for humility isn't easy in our "me first" world. But as we rest securely in our Savior's love, He will give us everything we need to follow Him.               Precious one, receive Yeshua (Jesus Christ) THIS VERY MOMENT!! Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord of your life. Believe in Him and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all mankind. Start living for the One whom is far greater than yourself. It is through your humble faith in Yahweh (Father God) our Creator, through His only begotten Son Jesus Christ that you will be elevated through Him and in His glory. Allow Him to live within you, transform you and glorify you to be a blessing to others.  ❤️❤️❤️
Doug is the type of guy who thinks he has a crush on this ugly car.
Dodge in back, ford in front.
Please don't make a fool out of yourself by keeping on pronouncing the word ترف/TARAF as torraff!!!!so disrespectful of you for not getting your fact straight!!!
this car didn't amazed me at all comparing to rolls royce, its over priced car made to rob middle easterns
Its ugly. like id literally be more impressed if I saw a porta-potty With a gocart engine strapped to it.
It's pronounced "ta-rough" in Arabic!
This car literally looks like something straight from GTA 5, and for Aston Martin, that's not a good thing.
This is a 100k car max and looks like a Honda Accord in front of a funny mirror at the circus.
Car doesn't deserve price tag of one million dollars. Doug is speaking like a road side agent. Worst in technology multimedia interface and true luxury comforts. Totally flop car..bad interiors.
All you're paying for is this cars low production count.  Pretty sleazy gimmick if you ask me.
I wouldn't pay 100k for this garbage.
wow this thing is trash..... exactly the kind of thing a rich arabic oil baron would buy
Wish Doug would take sum of the time from head/tail/turn/brake lights, & spend it on tech/connectivity/audio/speakers/wattage
All rear seats are legally required to have child anchors, so I don't understand why it is surprising.
Nobody in their right mind would pay a million dollars for this thing. Except for rich arabs who need to stand out in the ocean of RR's, lambos and bentleys I guess... Smart move from Aston Martin
I won't pay 50k for this it looks hideous
I’m sorry this doesn’t look better than the Rapide. This looks like a preface lift Dodge Charger Rt and Honda Accord.
i want the Lagonda ashtray
When is Doug gonna stop dressing like a 10yr old
A $30K kia has better technology than this its really funny :)
With all due respect , It looks like a desperate attempt to outshine the other luxury cars & suck money from non-smart not self made wealthy Arabian individuals
Client: What do I get for a million dollars? Ashton Martin: We made the speedometer in the wrong direction. Client: So cool, here you go my million dollars.
If the front end of a new gen Honda accord and genesis g80 had a baby it would look like this.. I do think it looks amazing tho 👌🏽
This car is worth 200k max
At first glance I thought it was ugly.  But afterwards.... I want one
Here is a car that you should try https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkMs4o0_wC8
that centenario is so sick!!!!!!!!!
looks like a fancy taurus
Black beauty
I can see the Lamborghini Centenario roadster review coming next😁😁
Engineers: how much leather should we use? Aston martin: yes
The s class coupe has a way better looking interior.
It's funny how auto makers can definitely make a car look so good on the exterior but they choose not to unless you pay them $900,000 extra, and yes I would definitely stop just to look at the car on the street if it appeared on my street ☺️
Dougs the type of guy to never wash his knees
We can see what a result. How Hyundai new genesis use a lot of leather.....
looks like something straight out of gta
so many ads on this channel, nowadays...
It looks incredibly plain for that price tag...
Doesn't look like  a million dollar car  interior
I hope this is Doug's 2nd most disliked video because he doesn't make any sense in this video and he didn't bashed the outdated features of the car.
9:40 prove that he got sponsored by Aston Martin. Look closely at what he's doing with the door.
Am I the only one who thinks "Lagonda" sounds like something a girl from the hood would be called?
Imagine spending 1 million dollars for a sedan no gauge cluster screen no touch screen infotainment system and it has less safety features.  "BRITISH ENGINEERING"
Is it just me or is it one, ugly and unworthy of an Aston Martin badge and two, no where near a $1 million price tag? Seriously, it's so ugly and this is coming from someone who thinks the DB9 is drop dead gorgeous. No to mention, it's not worth $1,000,000. Maybe $100,000. I'd rather have a new Lexus than this thing.
Why does it cost a million dollars, why is it called the Lagonda Taraf, and why is it painted in primer?
Speaking of which, be sure to check out Taraf de Haïdouks, especially their black and white gig.
Literally just a rapide with an uglier chassis and 8 times the price...
I DONT OWN ONE, BUT MY AUNTIE DOES AND ITS THE BEST CAR EVER
Part of the price justification for this car is one very important point that Doug doesn't mention: almost the full body  was carbon fibre
Dude it looks so bad. I don't see any Aston Martin soul here. Not the guy who designed this but all the people who approved this should get their dicks cut. I am not kidding.
Looks like the LC500 has a better interior quality than this thing
Please please make a video about the centenario.
Dougs V8 had a shit ton of these features but he’s clearly now acting like a salesman for these dealerships, otherwise he would clearly be like my 40k v8 had this lol
So basically, it’s just a Rapide with a different body... I was expecting a lot more for 5 times the money. No wonder they only planned to sell it in the Middle East - most rich sheiks don’t really care about cars, they just want them to be as expensive and exclusive as possible.
Lincoln continental but make it ✨worse✨
Side view:  Dodge Challenger  Front: Ford Taurus. The back: $1,000,000
Bruce Wayne owns too!
*Somebody* overpaid.
Odd looking car to me front is nice side view just little odd , maybe the Weird flat black paint  doesn’t really work. For that price I would want deep deep immaculate drippy gloss pearl black.
The front end of a million dollar car should not remind me of a 2011 Ford Edge.
Turn heads? At 24:45 I didnt see any heads turn
Take a shot every time he says lagonda
And give me a tesla roadster and model x and 3 instead.. and I can invest t The rest of the money lol
*Its shit*
Viva La Lagonda!! ✊
1 million!  for what?  This car can do nothing and various solutions such as navigation or the refrigerator in the trunk are improvised botch.
Is it coated in Teflon?
Doug: One of the most beautiful cars ever made                                                                                                                                      ~Pontiac Aztek has entered the chat~
So, you get less than half of RR for twice the price... Good deal !
I thought for sure Doug would give this car a 6 for value just like he gives almost everything else.
The front looks like a hot girl doing a duck face.
1million ! That grill better be made out of solid platinum. Ugly...Looks like a Honda Accord and a Ford Fiesta Had a baby
Another feature: part of this car or the whole car was brought from Russia 🇷🇺 and this is how I understood it: on the back on the ignition key, there is a specific icon placed on electronics imported to Russia, it is called "Rostest" and you can see it at 17:29 when Doug  examines the key from behind (left icon).  ❤️Like it to be noticed by Doug.❤️
In reference to shoddy technology: "It's all they had at the time" Checks the beginning of the video: "THIS is a 2018!"  lmao Doug was too kind on the tech in this car.
the polestar 1 is way more beautiful and cheaper than this generic looking car.  really like there is no soul in its design. and seriously what type of a rear bumper is that, it looks like there is nothing there. they were so lazy to even hide the machinery in the bonnet.
That’s one beautiful engine
Sorry, I do not find this car even slightly "beautiful"...
In my opinion its not worth a million dollars
I'm wondering how come Aston Martin didn't realize until they spent $130 Million on THE LEATHER..
Think it doesn't look nice at all
22:21 me when I’m super rich and use this phrase to scold my children for breaking glasses at home.
Great review! Obviously a beautiful car but the amenities seemed very....coach
did someone ever think about car scam for idiot rich people?? i can say its super not worth it. paid 1 million dollar for a car that look like 200 thousand dollar car. i think people who buy that car  just got scammed.
I don’t see how this car worth about 2 rr phantom or 6 panamera gts, nothing special tbh
Why couldn't you just crouch, why did you have to get your knees dirty?
It has two USB ports in 2018?!!?+ that's insane. No wonder it's one million dollars
Compared to a modern Bentley , the interior seems down right garbage
I need one in my life
This looks like these gta cars that looks familiar and doesn’t look like any other car at the same time
Only sold 120 worldwide, because there are only that many ridiculously stupid rich peoples kids to sell it to.
can we talk about that huracan tho? 0:43
They might as well make just one of this and price it for 100 million dollars purely for exclusivity. It' a disgrace to the original Lagonda which the company put much more effort in designing and building. This seems like the easy way to make an easy money from Aston, just like what Lamborghini does with their limited edition models. Unfortunately, many manufacturers are following this trend. I hope that Ferrari and Porsche will not.
You just need a man to drive you while you sitting in back.
So Honda accord
Compared to other cars for a fraction of that price it's not particularly luxurious or sporty
Can't forgive it for looking like a Ford fusion in front and having a 2-stage door handle opening process.. but... Leather headliner Umbrella Ford switch gear  Forget Pagani kind sir, I'll have a... What's this thing called again, Doug?
$1 million, BUT THE KEY!
Looks like a car from gta online
cant believe im saying this, but this is probably the first car design from aston martin that i dont dig. looks like a dodge from side profile....
Is it me or Doug has a MASSIVE high school crush on this car?
Ngl my new Toyota Corolla has a much more modern steering wheel
Those LCDs in the back look so cheap, they almost have an aftermarket feeling. It was a car clearly made to make a quick cash-in from the market of the Middle East. That’s why it wasn’t intended for Europe or North America. Because no one there with common sense would give one mil just for signal lights that alternate between orange and red. This car is a scam.
Doug should review a craftsman lawnmower
hide the crappiness...with hide
Doug: I hate how whenever a car has "soft close" anything, you still slam it, lol
26:10 no wonder he says the gear gearchanges are good: it's got a ZF 8HP in it
Thhhiiiiissssss
The tech in this car is the saddest part for $1 million 2018
Wait, the Lagona is back?!  I thought it was gone in the 80s.  It looks cool.
Прощай БелАЗ здравствуй польский унитаз 🤣
Looks like a Genesis sedan.
I wouldn't pay a million for this dog shit even if I had bezos money
This dude is so brand biased it’s comical. If this exact car came out under a brand like Acura, this video would encompass doug shitting on the hood and walking off middle fingers extended.
https://youtu.be/t20Nt1Ca5qg   That is a luxurious 4-door sedan.  And way cheaper actually.
This car isn’t worth $100k to me an nobody in North America will buy this. The bmw , Benz E series has more features and nicer interior than this. The car is actually gorgeous but the price point is a rip-off. Everything is terrible looking inside just brown leather. I know why Rolls-Royce is the ultimate in making luxury cars.
Well ford still owns an 8% stake. Hey Doug isn't the 6L V12 a version of the Ford Duratec V12?
One million dollars and the throttle is not in the floor 🤦🏻‍♂️
Worst value for money ever!  (still, I wouldn't mind a ride in one)
Yea thought so, Aston Martin is nothing more than a money making scheme now. They think they are clever but they are slowly killing the brand and they don't even know it.
Even if I could ever afford a car like this (pure fantasy), I'd still go for the new Audi RS7 , I think it looks better!
Looks an awful lot like a Chinese Ford Fusion for something that costs 4x my house
Is it so expensive, because of the Lagonda logos?
Waiting for Doug giving explanation about this review in more Doug demuro
If you spend a million bucks on a car for public approval, you need help.
Why on earth does it have an exposed door lock?? awful.
now i know where genesis stole the design.  it looks like a g90 with a sonata in the rear.
From the side looks like a 4-door Dodge Challenger.  Nothing special, looks like it was made to scam oil-billionares from middle East... and Doug (who loved it).
Its not that nice or impressive
No offense but the front of this car remind me of the Honda Accord
“Like how a lot of cars from this era did”.... that was 2 years ago.... 😂
The front end looks like a Honda accord.
TARAF TV
Volvo xc90 excellence is more luxurious than this car. It is a hundred thousand dollars in price and Doug is giving the value about a 3. This car is shit and it is getting a 4 in value
Yo Doug, you wrong my man. The e38 is better looking than this $1 Accord look alike car (from the front)
$1 million and no sunroof?
Not that great looking at all. Interior materials and stuff are nice, but pretty standard for an Aston. 100% not worth the almost $1 million price tag.   If you're paying 3x what the car should be worth for "rarity" it means the car isnt that good to begin with at all.
Costs two Rolls-royces. Only worth half?
I don't care how exclusive this car is, it ain't worth 1 million
I’d rather get a Rolls Royce
The front looks like an older Hyundai Sonata
The best looking ? Bro i would rather look at a M8
Expected a lot more from a million dollar car. Lots of black plastic in the interior and outdated infotainment. Wouldn’t even pay 100k. I could find more features in a 60k car.
I don't think its that beautiful, sorry Doug. His score was way too high.
1 mill not even a sun roof, wtf? but then again this only for bored billionaires are real car collectors, so jus think of it like that
They should leave the Mercedes-AMG logos on their current engines
Why a mat black.. Completly kills the design..
It’s ugly
Aston Martin: *No cows were harmed or killed in the making of this car*  Also Aston Martin: What makes this car special and expensive is the ultra fine  L    E    A    T   H   E   R!
This is one sexy car!
ngl the front headlight looks like the ford fusion and the bmw i8 had a baby
Wow really doesnt worth the price just for a V12 and lots of leather, better have a Bently
Not gonna lie, this car is kind of ugly. Looks like  hellcat in the back (from the side) and a 1980s japanese car in the front (also from the side). Looks very stretched and it seems like two people who don't get along were charged with designing this car
I never thought that honda selling a $1m accord
10:02 looks like it won't stay exactly where you want to put it.
Id rather buy a BMW M8 competition or a Mercedes gt 63s!!! BTW its beautiful car.. Hope they put a suicide door!
Lololol only if I had that kind of money , im still trying to get my 1923 model t running
I thought the value would be a 1 or the first 🚗 he gave a 0 to
The Rolls-Royce Phantom is a sedan. The 2020 Phantom starts at $455,000  The Rolls-Royce Cullinan is an SUV. The 2020 Cullinan starts at $330,000  The Lamborghini Urus is an SUV. The 2020 Urus starts at $207,326  the 2020 Mercedes-Benz S-Class Maybach price starts at $173,000  The Flying Spur is Bentley's starting price north of  $200,000  the Bentley Bentayga 2020 stars at $156,900
10:03 it'll stay exactly 🤣🤣
Turath means heritage in Arabic
Doug: May I review your Lagonda?  Owner: OK, but you have to mention at least a thousand times that my car is beautiful  Btw, the car is beautiful
Looks like a $100k car. I understand the price because of the exclusivity, but it looks underwhelming.
You mean 119 owners since this ones at a dealership
Looks like some off gta 5
So is it worth a million cuz theres 980 k in the glove box? 🧐
Pay a million dollars and ask the dealer "where's the paint? Don't I get any paint?" "You get .....primer"
What is Dough talking about? That rear end is trash and the front looks like a blowfish. Lol
A 2016 Honda Civic has better features in the interior then the Taraf
🤮
Rolls Royce Cullinan (Black Badge) slaughters this car from a luxury standpoint. At half the price.
Orrrrr buy 4 roadster 2.0s
It is like a Honda Accord stretched with a Ford Mondeo face.
A8 d3 still better, same audio system, better finish ets and 10y older
This is the automotive definition of 24k pure gold*          * Plated.
the front is honda accord inspired.....LOL
It doesn’t even look that good
Good stuff man
Not worth it.
Dude. You're sweating in my car and getting your grimy mitts on it.
This car looks like a GTA V car
Kinda sad that my used 2010 Nisan maxima has a better infotainment system...
Is it me or the wheels look super out of place
You should review Lamborghini Estoque😌
A car made for the Middle East market.. 1 million dollars. I know, let’s offer only heated seats in the rear 😒
The lambo teaser hype is just too much...
"Legonda is Aston Martin's Luxury brand" ah yes, I hate my cheap aston martins
How can you charge 1 MILLION DOLLARS for a car that, may well be very luxurious, but has Aston Martin and FORD switchgear from a decade ago ?! The centre console just looks terrible.
No the rear brake light stays red when the turn signals are flashing
Flying Spur over this any day
Me: Ford Fusion for sale with Leather Middle East: OK WILL PAY 250K!
That drink door should be wood or aluminum...  Same with the turn signals and the dials... all this plastic is so ghetto
I agree its stunning shame about that price tag
Hey Doug can you do the 2000 BMW 528i sport edition?
Miss Laganja Estranja should drive this car.
why do it look like a ford Taurus tho
I'd LS swap it.
Yeah my mom had a ford fusion back in 2013, these are nice. Id take a Vantage aaaaanyday over this are u kidding me💀💀😂
Nice front end Honda Accord
There is an Aston Martin logo in the infotainment system.
This is not worth a million, maybe to an Arab with easy money yes, but not to a enthusiast, nor is it beautiful. Sorry Doug you are wrong at this time.
The front of the car looks like a Honda Accord...
DO A 90s TAURUS SHO
If a lesser known car brand  does this, the review would be totally different. The first thing he's gonna say is ;"For a million dollar car, why is the keyhole so bluntly exposed, but because its an Aston Martin everything is perfect and innovative . Slap on some leather on everything and there you go +$800K .It should come standard with its own tablets not just  the clips. Even an Acura can do that. Heartbeat Sensor looking ass navigation system.Turn Signal from a ford focus??? The fucking fridge fan in the trunk,, I know u cant cover it, but at least try to make it less visible. Looks like they got that part from a DIY  car cooler YouTube video. IMO the car is ugly as fuck from the outside. The backseat looks cool and comfy.  Get that cheque Doug!!
Nice looking but the tech looks pathetic even for 2018
Honestly the 70s/80s lagonda is wayyy fucking cooler.
Its not a terrible looking car, but as far as 4-door sedans, the Porsche Panamara has it beat.
meh I accept it's gorgeous but features are shit. just leather nothing else. come with whatever luxury car but my favorite is always s650 Maybach .
This car sucks
Rolls Royce looks expensive, regal and classy. This is on the other hand......has none of those qualities
Lmfao look at the infotainment system suck me up Aston Martin you guys are wild af
Rapide looks better
Everytime I see a car painted that color I think cool they got it in black primer I wonder what color they are going to paint it?😂😂
Looks like a GTA V pedestrian vehicle 😂
Horrible review doug, this car was f**king trash for 1 million
Another car I can drive in my dreams
Looks like a ford fusion 😂
Only one “features” point higher than the 1994 S class
The price all pay for the styling. Many feature such as soft close trunk, 90s BMW E38 7er and W140 S class has those feature already....but this is the price tag for the exclusivities. That is how it works lol......
The front end be looking at you like 👁👄👁
10:00 "place it exactly where you want"......  door moves from where he placed it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I agree, amazing looking car! Aston always comes with the heat 🔥🔥
This is a pretty unremarkable car and proof positive a high sticker price doesn't always equate to class.
Why does the back door window look like a 2012 camry
How do you not talk about the satin black paint job? I love satin black more than any paint 😍
doug definitely getting a commission if sold
The front reminds me of the Honda Accord.
You can get more and better from a 10 yr old Mercedes S-Class. Wonder how much the dealer paid for this ?
Looks like a pretty version of a current gen Honda accord in the front
S class looks and is more luxurious than this trash 🗑
Eric Clapton Ferrari? Tell me more...
I can't wait for Hoovie to buy one of these in 12 years
I'd rather save $500k and have the Rolls.  I might be the only one that thinks this car is tacky and ugly
Doug is the kind of guy to shoot videos where he hides his victims bodies
Ok, I'm Arab, and this is the first time i hear the term "Lagonda", am i broken?
Does anyone else think the front end looks exactly like a current gen honda accord
I don’t see the beauty that Doug does....the proportions don’t look right.  Also the color doesn’t do it any favors
Could not disagree more with the styling. The proportions of the car are terrible. It really looks like they put an Aston inspired front and rear end on a Dodge Charger. It's basically an uglier Rapide that costs about $900000 more than it should. Doesn't matter how rare it is if it isn't a good car. Definitely the most off base review I've seen from Doug.
Completely not worth a million. Much rather have a maybach for 1/3rd the price.  Lol,  and headlights remind me of a Acura TL. This is just one of those cars made to be bought by Saudi oil princes so they can just 1up the other princes’ car collections.
This car is just a marketing fail. How dare can a Aston Martin cost more than a Rolls Royce Phantom
what a ripoff, don't even rate the design as much
The door will stay right where you put it... well... maybe here not 10:02
Looks like a high trim ford fusión
Uganda giraffe;)
lAgOnDa
Million Dollar car gets Crappy Ford Focus Stalks and cheap Garmin Infotainment System I say the worst and best car
Who the heck buy this car ? I mean not luxurios as bentley or rolls royce, looks like dodge charger from front, multimedia is joke, but man what the heck that trunk ? This car  120-150K based price should be
Definitely not worth a mill.
It looks like a Dodge to me, not so great, no offense, I dont care for it
1 MILLION? hahaha yeah sure
Well, it looks exponentially better than their older four-door vehicles - but it's still hideous from every angle (and unnaturally-proportioned from about half of them). And that's probably what the head of the company said upon seeing the product brochure for the first time. Followed immediately by, "How on earth are we going to unload these revolting things." At which point, the head of the marketing department would have walked over, took the brochure from the president's hand, pulled out his pen, and added another zero to the MSRP. And then they both smiled, patted each other on the back, and went away laughing.
Kinda looks like a 4 door challenger concept
So much of the features in this vehicle are disappointing for 1 million dollars. Pixelated screen and analog gauges, crappy Garmin infotainment system instead of Mercedes COMAND, cheap looking plastic in the center console,  a rear center console shared with the Rapide, and only 500 horsepower. The gauge cluster should be a full LCD, the infotainment system should be Mercedes's COMAND system, the center console should have aluminum or piano black instead of stupid plastic, and the rear center console should just be more bespoke and special. Anyone who paid 1 million dollars for this is frankly an idiot. A Rolls Royce would have been a much MUCH better vehicle.
Honestly the Rolls Royce Phantom is better value for money and overall I would bet even the Bentley Continental is better. Aston Martin is known for their high prices and low quality compared to rivals
So that's where my secret leather stash went
$1,000,000 for this no thank you, I would have a fleet of vehicle's wayyyyy better! The Aston Martin One-77 is worth the asking price, this Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf. Aston Martin can keep this overpriced sedan. The Genesis G90 looks better then this for only $75,000.00
The information you gave about importing it was very interesting I wonder if I can get one of the mini trucks from Japan imported to America new
Looks like a bmw i8 from the side
Not that impressed to be honest
Lucky guy
Personally I think a 2020 Lexus LS blows this out of the water 🤷🏼‍♂️
share price dropped 90% since this car was built
I can't unsee that horrible and ugly key hole
Imagine being able to watch this video and say "I'm gonna get this car next week"
God what an absolute waste of money. Makes me stressed that someone would even consider buying this
The worst case of cultural exploitation ever.  Literally paying $850,000 extra for the Taraf name and 2 extra doors.   Great used value!
Binod
No Lagonda branded champagne glass? Definitely not worth a million.....
Love the paint job on that Honda Accord
Cars and bids huhhh? Ima check it out good buddy 😬🤟🏾🐐
Nice 2022 Ford Taurus, wait what?
I dig the styling and some of the interior detailing but very underwhelming besides the styling and AM demeanor,  give me a S65 instead
Anyone else see a Honda accord front end?
Doug is the kinda guy who says, “A MILLION DOLLARS” a lot.
Your credibility score is zero, one with IQ score zero will pay 1 million for this
Can put the door in any position and it will stay....... except you had to catch it and stop it closing.! Lol
Is it worth even $300'000 ? Not really Would I lust after one,were I a millionaire car collector?  Hell yeah😃
9:55 literally all cars need this
I'm sorry but that thing is fugly. I think every other Aston Martin looks better than this one
I’ll take a Rolls Royce Phantom over this ALL DAY.
S class still wins on value for money
ITS ALL ABOUT THE "LAGONDA" BRANDING MOBILE PHONES: WE HAVE "APPLE" CAR INDUSTRY: WE HAVE "LAGONDA"!
*Spends $1 million on a car* Still gets Bridgestone Potenzas.... 😂
Nice...but not a million dollar nice.. can think of a lot better ways to spend a million. Don't even get a sunroof😢
I agree that it's beautiful,  but most beautiful 4 door sedan ever? Not even close.
You can’t tell me this is better than the phantom Aston Martin
If your life is getting harder it probably means your leveling up 👍
a million dollar luxury sedan and you can't lie down in the back passenger side seat... disappointing
Not a key Doug. Aston calls it an Emotional Control Unit.
Personal taste, i think the rear looks nice but the side and front profiles are disturbing
GARMIN?!?!!?! Lmaoooooooo holy
Love how the doors stay open like that.....very amazing......just like a 2012 Panamera......sarcasm
Hey Doug, the "weird circles with smaller circles pattern" that covers the middles of the seats is called Broguing (pronounced bro-ging), it's the same technique used on leather shoes and not particularly hard to achieve.
Taraf , ترف is the ultimate luxury which is this beautiful expensive machine
Am I the only one who thinks that the front end looks like a 10th gen Honda Accord?
theres like no legroom in the back though lol
For a million bucks I would at least expect a piece of art like the Huayra.
Am I the only one who thinks it looks plain?
What you’d expect from an old car?....it’s a 2018 dude...OLD?
05:44 Rear angle really reminds me of the old Jaguar XF, before they cheapened it.
Why doesn't Doug have those MOLES removed from his face? He can afford a plastic surgeon.
Without a doubt, the ugliest car worth over 100k.
I can build an E63 to be Better than that.
24:44 well, the regular worker ready to go fishing certainly doesn't give flip there is car like no other in visual range
pay a million bucks for something with a garmin, just because it's rare, embosses 'lagonda' 20 bajillion times, and has an all-leather headliner?  when it rides 'OK'?  come on now, let's be real.  i'd take a decked-out 2021 genesis over this anyday...
I wouldn't pay over $300k for it.
I thought it was an old car hahha
You cant be driving around with open bottles in the car wtf .....?? thats funny . that door shock got me ..... im out .
Range Rover autobiography also has a leather roof...
That thing better ride like a cloud, go like mad, and have more tech than a Mercedes S Class to justify that price tag
Doesn't even have a sunroof ffs
Yes but how much does it cost?
belt buckle leather foreskin
The Porsche Panamera doors do the same..  open them to where you want them...🙄
Anybody else think the exterior doesn’t actually look that good? I prefer the exterior of basically any other modern 4 door super luxury car from Bentley, rolls, Mercedes s class, etc
I swear he’s reviewing the cars he shows when he’s talking about Cars and Bids...
Is a centenario review coming? IS IT??? Can’t wait
Over priced for what you get!
“ 1million better be coming with a 5 bedroom, 5 bath, furnished house and a 10 years worth of free food.
Million dollar car. No sunroof...
the front looks like a BMW i8
A phantom is better sedan than this
Who the hell would buy this?!
Idk why these comments are so salty. Taste is subjective. He obviously likes it. I think it looks good. Not worth a million but they did make it for people who could burn hundreds of thousands of dollars a day and not even notice. Better for thier margins with such a low production run.
Doesn't look like a million $ sedan , back is really hideous as is the grille. Regular aston martin coupes and sedans looks far better then this car. Not too fast and doesn't have more horsepower.
Nice Maserati....
Love the vid Doug, keep up the good work!  Not hating on Doug when i say this but that car isn't worth anywhere near 1M dollars. A 1M dollar  doesn't have friggin Ipads and leather covering every square inch to make up it's worth haha There are cars a quarter of this cars price that offer more for the money. But hey, it's a limited run and all and wasn't designed for the US market, so to each their own.
Front looks like arteon facelift and rear looks like charger concept car. Gets 10...
5:54 i thought VW Passat of some generations ago has switching turn signals like that. And I wonder why they don’t make it like that anymore. Probably regulations. But itwas cool.
I always wondered what a million dollars worth of leather looked like.
I hope lil uzi gets me this car for Christmas 🤞🏾
My camry has most of the features on this car  Steering wheel Body Engine Trunk  Center console Radio Bluetooth Seats Cylinders Winshield Headlights Door
Doug I think you need glasses...  it’s far from the most beautiful car... looks seriously plain... an boring... Fuckin hideous... have to be a complete moron to pay $1bar for this... fuckin Ford turn signals! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is Doug a nail biter ?
Looks kinda cheap
WHY DIDN'T HE REV IT OH MY GOD.
I would pick a Mini Cooper over this car any day.
Looks like something straight out of GTA 5
It's time to visit my optometrist, since Doug is telling me that I will not encounter another sedan this beautiful.  Yet, to my eyes, my 2017 Mazda6 GT Premium is much more beautiful inside and out.
This is everything wrong with the hypercar classes,  the bread and butter cars and more important which is why especially Astion and Mclaren are bassicly bankrupt.
Rather get the Phantom, amg gt black series. Instead of one stupid lagonda
No.
Imagine paying $1 million dollars for a Taraf in Dubai and not even getting ventilated seats.
*That's not even close to being worth a million dollars. I'd rather have a Phantom and a Cullinan. R.I.P Martin!* 🙏🙏
Hoovie in 5 years: "I BOUGHT THE CHEAPEST LAGONDA TARAF IN THE WORLD!!!"
I don’t really feel like he’s Doug we used to know
The metal plate on the inside of the hood looks more luxurious than my house.
Even if the price isn't justified, I've gotta give it to Aston Martin.. this is a truly beautiful vehicle. I love the exterior styling.  As for the purported bias from Doug.. I really don't see it. Maybe a little bit of extra justification of the price in the driving section, but no real bias, in my opinion.  If I had to guess, this car costs so much solely because of it's main market: the Middle East. There's tons of absurdly wealthy people there. If Aston Martin can get away with selling a car for an insane price, because they know people will buy it.. why not? As Doug mentioned, the car was never intended for any other markets.
That grill gives me a kind of a Arteon vibe
27:45 this is a weird way to say “fuck no”
Am i the only one wondering why doug is on his knees at 8:42 😂😂💀
I’ve been watching Doug for years and this is the first time I feel he was bribed to say good things. Don’t be a sell out Doug.
looks like genesis
Million dollar car review by a man doubled up in t-shirts and rocking shorts.
Taraf or ترف literally means luxury in arabic
Incoming, “I bought the cheapest Lagonda Taraf in the whole world” video
Model 3 handlebars and middle glass like the model S. I see where they got that from.
That's a Mondeo
Get that ford explorer front out of my face
$1M and it has a key hole on the door.
I gotta say, gorgeous car, but I'm more partial to your Rolls Royce reviews. Humph!
Seriously Garmin I wouldn’t call it infotainment since the radio is seperate
Cool car.  Not $1 million cool.  MAYBE 225K at the highest.  I was going to say $350k until I saw the plastic Ford switches and plastic, outdated centre console and steering wheel.  I would also expect at least 700 ish horsepower for a million dollar Aston sedan.  I'll take a RR Dawn, please.
A Lagonda Taraf drove by the giraffes as they ate tariffed feed from the trough.
Ugly color in my opinion
Price is basically fixed. Value is in the eye of the beholder and dependent on the value picture you live in. If I had a million to spend on a car, there is no way I would buy this one. If I have several billion dollars, the car is simply an object of desire and the price is not a barrier to my owning it. The value, as Doug said, is in me having something that nobody else has got, and I can pay for it, so the price is not important.
22:13 Doug my fucking Mazda CX-5 does that calm down
Aston Martin’s luxury brand! like Louis Vuitton needed a luxury brand!😂😂😂
Haha, all I hear is Laganja Estranja lol. Rip chi chi btw.
After I realize the mideast rich people have 1000X the money I have, meaning the $1M car to them is basically a $1k car to me. Now this car suddenly makes sense.
That is not worth one million lol, give me a rolls
I really dont see the beauty that Doug seems to see.
Future hoovies garage: I bought the cheapest aston martin lagonda taraf.
Way overpriced junk worth 100k at most
Imagine having $1M of disposable income and spending it on this.
As soon as I saw the Garmin navigation I realized this car isnt even worth 50K. Luxury and performance should also go in hand with the technology in the cabin, especially when you're paying top dollar for a car
I can’t stress how much more I would prefer a BMW 3 Series to this car.
so leather on the roof is more impressive than the starry night roof...okay
This thing is not worth anywhere near 1million. LMAO!!
Lmao in 10:03 the door moved but Doug caught it and just disregarded it-
Fack dat.. front end is like a Ford Fusion
BOGUS
This car was just a fiscal flex for a place on Earth where some people will pay a million dollars for an exclusive vanity plate.
it looks like a chrysler
It’s like the price tag makes it look REALLY uninteresting
no one: not even bentley or rolls royce: aston martin: lets make a $1mil sedan and make it a limited production lol
Honda Accord has a similar front end... Look at one and you won't be able to un-see it. I'm sorry but that ruins it for me.
A good looking street legal aston martin? Never thought I'd see one.
If you ever wondered what a Lamborghini Estoque and a Camaro having a baby will look like, this is it.
The front lights look like a Honda Accord lol not very distinctive imo.
BTW : Most beautiful car is still E38 .
10:25 a million dollar car and the rear door sounds like a '95 civic
I haven't seen Doug talking so weirdly before!
why he is on knee ! Is that a kind of respect to car !
Looks like a honda acord from the front
This channel should be renamed......"Doug's on Drugs!"
Looks like a dodge dart
The side looks like a Dodge Challenger to me. Not worth $1M
314 kph - must be one of the fastest limousines  Brabus Mercedes Maybach 900: 350 kph
Dude when is that Centenario vid dropping!?
Looks like another Ford sedan.
It’s like the 1980 batmobile had a baby with James Bond’s car
The price tag can only be explained by the presence of ultra rich customers who would buy a car only because if it’s rarity and expensiveness to finally park it  in some large garage being only available for collectors in the future to look for.
Thats a really nice Ford Fusion!
Look likes new honda accord
That roof line looks so forcibly stretched tbf
Thats enough 'hard work' for today Doug
The audio lagged at the beginning of the video so it sounded like:   "Sss... is a 2018 Aston Martin"
meh.
So you could have a 2020 RR Phantom, a 2020 Lamborghini Huracan, and a 2020 Cadillac Escalade with about 200k left ... Orrrr    This million dollar Hyundai. You chose
Quite a bit of last generation G80 in there. Just saying.
Visible gas struts on the doors ... seriously !!! Can't believe this is for a million dollars!
$1 Million Ford Taurus. Nice.
1 million? Stop joking
You could have given Hoovie a shout-out as a Rapide owner.  Just sayin.
What moron would buy a million dollar car that uses the exact same turn signal stock out of Ford Focus?
You know, anybody can make a car video   Seriously...any...one. BUT, I really enjoy your car review videos. You're definitely the best person that I have seen on Youtube, that does these type of videos. Just wanted to leave a positive comment
It's Hideous.
This is nothing special at all for 1 million dollars, maybe around $180,000
Sure, it's nice... But a million dollars USD nice? Nawh bro
This video deserves a lot more dislikes.
Lagonda seems like something genesis would built, minus the leathers of course
10:03 We saw the little fail there, don’t try to hide it from us
Very nice only a few 🙃😍
For his next act, Doug will review a limited edition Falcon X rocket.
This one I don't understand. Even if I were a billionaire I'd rather drive an S class or 7 series.
"...and the most head turning, PERIOD" i would litterally not notice this car even if it was the only one in front of me
It must look better in real life
Looks like an accord up front
... and the rx-8 had a too long wheel base?!
This is the worst review I’ve ever seen him do 😞
This car doesn't worth 1 Million in any way, the Hyundai Sonata has more technology, and an engine Similar to a Mercedes V12AMG, but 5 times cheaper... This car looks aged, with the dashboard of the Aston Martin generation that just phased out, Audi have way better taillights, and the headlights of a Dodge Charger does exactly the same than this car!!! Aston Martin shall see the headlights of a BMW 3 series, that are way better than this one. One thing that upsets me of a car this price, is the key socket in the driver's door!! No car today has this old thing anymore. Getting together, any luxury sedan from Audi, Mercedes Benz or BMW will worth more the value than this car. And just to mention, the new Bentley Flying Spur, that is about 400K, is wwwaaayyy better than this one, from style, technology, presence and beauty.
Looks like an expensive Ford in the front
Nice Accord
"This is a Reeeeeaaaaly gorgeous car.. It gets a Doug score of 2 out of 10"
I like the original better
After a certain level, people with cash care about exclusivity more than the features.
Rediculous. Horrendously overpriced and some scant details overlooked for the price point. The chiller in the boot, they couldn't even be arsed to put a trim piece in to cover that tower PC power supply esque fan for the fridge! The dials, all old VH/Volvo architecture! How much would it add for some machined ally stalks? If this was anything else he'd have torn it a new arsehole, so many things overlooked, and it's not very pretty in my opinion, much nicer looking saloon cars out there. I feel this is the transition from Doug the reviewer to Doug the salesman.  Not impressed with the car, or the new Doug.
it's ugly, it looks cheap, 2/10
The headlights and tail lights are absolutely NOTHING to spend even a moment discussing DOUG! and you should know better!  For a $1 million car?!!!??? Really? You can rest easy to trust me as tell you this: The headlights and tail lights are nothing special and they were lazy as eff with them- Like a budget Lincoln or something 🤣🤷🏽‍♂️  They not only could have, but SHOULD have done so much better if they wanted to really make a statement that this is the “worlds most beautiful car” (and by the way if we’re discussing the geometry of the vehicle and fluidity of the lines then yes, I agree that it IS close👌🏽)   Any Audi 1/10th the price’s headlights/tail lights are multiple orders of magnitude more artistic than the POS ones on here.   Don’t even get me started on that “fully front-to-rear” glass (panel) in the middle of the windows, which doesn’t even appear to be flush with the rest of the glass. They could have even done it with only ONE seam simply by having the front door glass overlap far more onto the B-pillar and reengineering the hinge of the rear door to open on a non-stationary axis (like unfolding a piece of lattice)🤦🏽‍♂️  Frustratingly, I have much more to say about this vehicle both good AND bad, The fact that it still has visible doorhandles is insane to me, we’re talking about a $1 million vehicle here, which is a gimmicky insult to vehicle brands that actually value ingenuity and exceptionality like Bentley or Rolls Royce. As I said, I’m not talking anymore so I’ll just end it here.... aaaaaaaas I quickly mention that this car just seems like Aston Martin had a brilliant idea to take advantage of some of those very wealthy Sheiks over in the Middle East who have more money than they know what to do with by slapping together a car that has the same fucking turn signal as a 2000 Ford Focus.  Ok, NOW I’m done.
I think the commenters are completely wrong about the look. Even if it isn't completely new, it is certainly one of the most beautiful sedans ever designed.  He is completely right about the beauty and presence.  This doesn't justify the price or the interior, but this looks incredible.
“Very strange” 🤣🤣🤣 it’s so dumb idk why you would spend $1,000,000 and it doesn’t have even cooled rear seats?????? And doesn’t even have Apple car play 👀 how?????
Doug, I actually love this car!. Id take it over a Bentley.  Love your reviews. Keep em coming, stay safe.
You could get a millionTrabants for that price!
Worlds most expensive luxury car ever 1m ok can we bring in the Mercedes benz Pullman plz
I looks like a Ford fusion lol
Doug gets a little more quirky with every passing video.
Does he really think this is the best looking sedan he's ever seen? It looks fine I guess but doesn't really blow my mind lol
Compare this to the ghost review.. lacks the blinds, interior seat heating, lighting etc, luxurious rep (Lagonda tf is that?), and overall distinct or even extremely opulent look -- it's muted like an Audi
million dollar car matted black with red calipers... how embarrassing...
The question is will it depreciate as much as the other Aston Martin models?
Honestly wouldnt give it a second look on a dealership floor
This car will be on sale soon and  you know where  “Cars and bids”
A genesis g80 is even better than this thing lmao
Y’all really expect me to believe that’s not a Volvo?
Front end looks like Ford.
Front end looks like Ford.
Front end looks like Ford.
Was this car painted by the same guy who refinished the trunk lid of that W140 S500 from the other day?
It's cool, but even if I had a 'spare' million, I wouldn't have one.
He Forgotten to say this car also has a flying system😁
The actors in this video are paid spokespeople
a million dollar aston martin from 2016 and it doesnt have as much equipment as a truck from 2019/2020?
100% a car for people with more money than sense. A million bucks and it has shitty Garmin nav and Ford turn stalks.
Honestly, it's hideous. I wouldn't even pay $100k for this POS.
Lagonda Taraf egyptian translation: Ford Fusion
The front end looks like a genesis. And the rear end is horrendous
I thought the Ford Fusion went out of production!!!
The British have officially reached a level of cynicism of Saudi oil merchants. The Crown has become the Crescent. Imagine living in such a state of despair that you're willing to pay over $1,000,000.00 for this unimaginative, indistinguishable freaking thing.
Where is the centenario Doug
What kind of paint is that?
Nice FORD Fusion
For a million bucks the door handle should've 'presented' itself automatically as the key holder approached.
I’d rather have a RR, Maybach, Bentley, or Porsche Panamera. Doesn’t seem anywhere worth the $1 million price point.
Wait a million dollars and I still have to purchase my own tablets lol
I thought this was a Dodge Charger at first glance
I like ur vids
This is not a good looking car, not even for a 4 door. It’s like someone badly described an Aston Martin and then gave it a horrible kink in the roof towards the rear.
Doug, what’s up with these kind of stuff you show as amazing features from a 1 million dollar car? Even a Honda Civic from the last few years have This feature of the door holding at the exact position you open it... 😅
If you want to sell a car for more than 500 grand just put an umbrella in it
Rear looks like a boat.
The front looks like a mix between a Ford Fusion and Mazda 😂
Doug explained why this cost $1M but a majority of comments are just talking about how this isn't worth anywhere near $1M. A car is worth what people will pay for it. They were all sold, right? A company could build 10 units of a totally unique model and sell it for $10M and there would be fights over buying it. A painting sold for $450,000,000. Surely a painting can't be worth that! Exclusivity!
Out of jealousy his wife down voted this video.
You know that the USA is the inky country in North America who used mph,in Canada we use km/h
Looks like the upcoming 2022 Ford Fusion. Haha
The front looks like a 2020 Passat
This car describes every car in GTA5
I'll take two Rolls Royce Phantom for that price.
No way
Only Doug drives a million dollar car with bedhead
This looks more like a 100,000 car than a 1,000,000
It looks cheaper than a rolls
Million dollar car.... Oooh! look at the turn signals!
I know that the buyers of these probably don't give a shit since it's all about status for them, but buying a $1.000.000 car and getting some shitty garmin navigation system + the turn signal stock of a ford fiesta on the inside would really annoy the shit out of me. Should've made a bigger volume to bring the price down and invest in some proper navigation system at least.
Literally just buy a speced  out phantom this car is ridiculous
Doug’s having a “senior moment”! Those hydraulic doors that stay in any position have been around for over a decade on BMW 7 series. My wife’s 2008 750Li has this “AMAZING” feature. C’mon Doug! That Aston is a joke.
1 million dollars and you get a visible key hole... really 😒
Not 1 new feature.
There are two types of learning; learning through memorization and learning through observation. I need time to learn any skill but I discover that time, psychologically, is not necessary.
Me: That is one of the ugliest cars I've seen.  Doug: This is the most beautiful sedan ever made.
I thought is would cost just about 300k at the first.....
Saab 9-5 wants their design back.
Nothing about this car seems superior to offerings from Rolls. Definitely not twice the price better. They only set the price at a million because the Saudis will buy it for that very reason.  This is 400k max, being generous.
Absolutely ugly Million times ugly
perfect design. But...those wheels are NOT looking like they belong on any expensive car. They look very aftermarket, tbh...on such a car
Looks like an Accord, Challenger, Altima, and Charger combined haha
Me I just caught Saab 900 my non car guy friend I think I have a Toyota laganda srtsti lol
I’m not sure if I’m more offended at this car’s price (for literally a rebadged Mercedes, rebadged Aston rebadging) or Harley and GMC charging $95k for that atrocious pickup.
Well, now it's used.
Idk why but Doug doesn't feel natural in this video for some reason he's trying too hard to make it look good.
This car is about beauty and leather but its horribly outdated and the design is from other cars like genesis ford and even honda
W....T....F ! 1 million... 😂😂😂 there is not a way to justify that price tag basically no matter what!  It would have to drive itself, fly itself cause it turns into a jet,  turn into a boat, massage my genitals, and do my taxes while real unicorns could jump out the trunk... and that would be on the base model
The first Rapide was much better looking
Don't see how it is remotely beautiful. Looks like a Korean design
Matte black paint with fish bowl glass makes me uncomfortable
Yeah?? Well is it as cool as my 1990 subaru sambar truck I just imported??
When You Have Car That You Can Buy McLaren Senna
Doug "dirty knees" DeMuro
Reminds me of what an Aston Martin Rapide would look like in GTA lol
Didn’t even know this existed.
I’d rather have 100+ clean E38’s
Distinctive repeated 100 times*
No one will like this car and review because Doug is trying to hide the flaws of this vehicle
Is it just me or is the paint dull as dirt?
Where is the skylight of this million dollars car?
Doug’s loosing his mind. The BMW E38 is MUCH more beautiful.
Every time he turns on start-up, I hear a Mountain Dew can rolling around the footwell.
Too distracted by Doug kneeling directly on cement. Use one of your extra t-shirts!
Not worth the price. Fake review
..they only made 120 units for the entire planet.. Me : Awww...now I have to buy it from Mars! 🙄
Stunning
I think the car is $300000 or $ 250000
These 4 door Aston Martins seem so gimmicky to me
I would offer them $10,000 on store credit
it pronounced in Arabic: Trf, not Taraf. No A.
👎 Not impressed
That's what $1M gets you?... yikes. Rather buy a phantom because at least their headliner has stars in it.
It looks like a Maserati Ghibli, just put a Trident 🔱 on the C Pillar 🤔
all that money no sunroof
Nice black car
And THISSSSS is ...         my best Jay Leno impersonation.
A 2020 Honda Civic looks more beautiful than this dump.
A MILLION DOLLARS💁
I see it’s nothing compared to Maybach for example!!
The Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf is the worlds most expensive,outdated and worst sedan ever
Ugliest Sedan ever
This is the dumbest fucking cash grab. A well specced S class wipes the floor with this garbage.
Nuttin  special here to warrant price
10:04 exactly... fail.
They hired Doug to sell this piece of expensive garbage.
looks like a GTAV car
The car isnt even true luxury just look at the touchscreen and then then back seat luxury but i only like one cool feature thats in 17:40. Go check it out. Edit- Btw he is reviewing a car of 2015.LOL
U fool this car is ugly
What a shit car.
Intensely beautiful?  This thing is ugly, in the same class as a Pontiac Aztec.
Definitely not worth a million, not even 500.000.  I'd rather have the latest gen of Maybach with full options or even the M760Li V12 for my vips. They will be more comfortable compared to this overpriced turd.
It looks like a Honda Accord... Sorry doug but its kinda ugly
Honda accord had a baby with a ford fusion...
That car does not look like a million dollar car. A Lincoln has a nicer interior.
not worth 1 million the leather is like the Lexus LC500
If this car didn’t have a b pillar I’d be nutting
Doug should do a unpopular opinion car version like Lamborghini‘s are just ok or Porsche is the best car company etc
lol if you don't want to buy the now 2nd "most beautiful sedan in the world" (E38) for a few thousand dollars, no worries! You can jump up to the "MOST beautiful sedan in the world" for a million bucks. Seems like a no brainer.
I feel bad for the person who has to detail this car. Fingerprints everywhere
I like how he mockingly capitalizes the name "The Tawrafffff"
Fake chrome and a plastic grill still most likely used on the exterior...
I would have 2 phantoms in two different colors to fit my daily mood rather than this... not worth 1m if u compare to RRs...
Too bad dodge never made the concept charger in 96. That was a beautiful four door.
Oh yeah never mind the lack of cargo space,  people investing in this beauty would have another car behind them just for cargo lol 😆
It can be very beautiful car but it has no road presence. Imagine a new RR Ghost Phantom is coming down the road and this is coming down the road. Which one do you look at? For sure RR. Because it has road presence. Moreover too much plastics in the car. It is basically a rip off but anyway ARABS have money to burn on anything.
The interior of a new S class is nicer than this one I swear lmao. The only thing this gets over it is all the leather... Ill take the new s class for 1/10 of the cost
This is a luxury Sedan??? WTF
I think this car was not selling so they called doug to do a review so that maybe he has a stupid viewer who is ready to buy this million dollar ford taurus
Take a shot whenever he says "but".
Holy shit.  1:30.  Can we say......................horrible paint job and whoever decided to detail it with a scrub brush should be fired.  WTF.  Good lord, haven't seen that many scratches and paint swirls in my life.
There are a lot of cars that make me want to have a million dollars, this is defenetly not one of them. If you would have told me it was a "a great bargain used Aston Martin" I would have beleived you.
just another reason to get a used Rapide...
What an absolute p.o.s.  Depreciated to $80k the moment it left the dealership the first time.
Ugly overpriced car. Not even worth the taxes you pay on it.
Thanks for the wonderful review! In my opinion,  Lagonda Taraf is the charity division of Aston Martin indirectly asking a million bucks for this vehicle. My 2020 Mazda 6 signature doesn't look much different.  My honest opinion!!
I saw this car on last video about s500 w140 and started to search any information about it but couldn't find anything. So thank you for satisfying my curiosity!
Taraf= تَرَف
Hmm i usually agree with Doug but on this one i gotta disagree.. for one i don't think the styling is a 10 more like a 6 or 7 at least, and the cool factor umm not a 9 more like a 6 or 7 at most and the price O.o lets be realistic even if i had 1 mil i wouldn't pay that much for this, i'd rather buy the Rapide for 60k or the phantom.
6 ltr V-12 that only makes 530 hp....for 1 million....
Rolling vegan nightmare...
Doug says "Ford Focus turn signal stalk" but ironically that stalk is found in just about every ford model BUT the Focus which actually has a much classier looking signal stalk.  Side note, the dude who imported this car probably paid more than it would cost to buy a brand new Rapide in importing fees, registration, and taxes alone.
Looks like a new accord from the front lol
I can’t spend over 35 000 usd ,,, on this
Douglas reviews a million dollar vehicle while wearing docker shorts and a yellow  t shirt.
So it’s like a suburban compared to the Tahoe. If the suburban cost 3 times as much as the Tahoe.
This looks like a Hyundai Genesis. Also modern Aston Martins tend to fall apart after 50k miles. Oh the connecting glass on the window instead of plastic... Oh ok nm... Totally worth a million dollars now. Totally.
A million dollars and they couldn’t be bothered hiding the key barrel 🤦🏼‍♂️
People talking all the crap can’t afford even a “base” 2010 Aston 😂😂✌🏾
Cheesy clip-on iPad on the back of the seats...  The Cadillac has screens that pop up from the seats... for $920,000 less..!!!
It literally has ford taurus headlights
Aston Martin is somehow like Maserati. Great history, materials and luxury but the interiors are simply outdated. With the new Vantage they gave a touch of novelty, but previous cars OMG. Look also at that pixelated display which shows the climate control in front, looks like what you find on a Prius.
I LOVE IT... just the rarity of it wooooow
This guy is on crack lmao. Most beautiful he said.
This is indeed the most esthetically beautiful 4 door car I've ever seen as well. But...it's not a million dollar car. Phantom money? Sure. I can see it being Rolls money. But for a million dollars, the rear console should have been specific to the car and - this is a 2018 model - there is NO excuse for that navigation system. That alone says to me that this car was pretty much a blatant money grab from rich Saudis.  *Edit: I get the rarity justification. Theoretically, it's why a real Hemi Cuda convertible or a mint AC Cobra fetches sick money. Obviously, they are worth what they're worth because they are unicorns. I guess the tendency is to compare it to other new ultra luxury cars and pit features against one another and that's not what this is. So I guess it makes sense. And these were made for people with so much money that they wouldn't blink at the idea of paying a million dollars for such a limited car. But it's still a one grab. They're using the limited number as the justification. #garmin
1Million? For a car that looks like a Honda accord @the front end and dodge charger in the rear. Not so unique 👎
Dear God get your sweaty arm off of the matte paint!
Yes I've been waiting for the Lamborghini Centenario roadster review!.
At least it doesn't have an AMG engine... Seeing a grown man dressed as a 10 year old boy review a million dollar car... Just seems so wrong...   Take a shot of your favorite spirit every time Dougie says the word "Distinct"...  You'll die of liver poisoning...   And so he still remains the one and only... Doug, The kind of guy who if he were a gynecologist, he'd  review the quirks and features of every ****** he examined.
Kinda looks like a GTA5 car not in a good way.
That is one ugly car
Depreciation after 2 years is worth about two packs of Marlboro lights and a big mac meal, combined
Lagonda: But wait, I'll double the offer!      *Just pay a separate shipping and handling fee
Doug Demuro the worlds most trusted man
Bruh I would take 2 phantoms in a heartbeat over this
That’s a shame
You should start reviewing the soundsystem in these luxury sedan, it makes sense that the quality should be on point in that section too.  The only way to know is to try it
😂😂😆 so forced, smh sounding like a true salesman ☹️
Take a shot of vodka for ever "distinct" word that Doug says 😂😂
Kind of looks like an Avanti!
Now I see where the new Genesis models might've got its styling from
🚮
The front end looks like a dodge charger
For twice the price they throw the umbrella in the trunk and they leave the back of the refrigerator exposed 😐 Lmao he even got on his knees 😂 8:43
Weird looking honda accord
a million dollars doesn't get you a sun roof, but my base model bmw 318ti that i got for $1,000 does. (and it works!)
Ford left the bailout cash on the table, but they should have left the deal to join AM.
I hate it. It should be on sale in America and should be a coupe. 11 year old Raghavan from Madras, India
Honestly, who would want this car spending  over a million dollars! This is totally joke!! I’m not even interested even this car worth around 100k
How many cows had to die for that interior???
The only truly crushing part of this car’s styling on camera (and I stress, on camera) is that the front is very akin to a Honda Accord, Hyundai Elantra or even a bit, the Chevy Malibu. This is true, especially on quick glance. Not that any of those vehicles are unattractive, but with such gorgeous rear and side profile lines, I’m a bit disappointed they didn’t go for more face-on. Although perhaps a different grill pattern/color would do it for me....
a million dollar fool to buy that.. because it looks just like a black over priced camry. and only 5+ hp such junk as usual from astron martin. the front of this car makes me want to puke and the thought its worth 1m makes me actually gag. is this what America has come down to.
looks like a Hyndai in front, and dodge in back, RR is much better looking IMO.
😎
What model lambo is that in the beginning
Garmin nav. in my 1 million dollar ride.
For $1 million, it’s pretty basic.
its actually kinda ugly for how much doug likes the looks  it might be the fucking matte black tho
This appear to be the same ignorant woman in another video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyVdZ-r3SQ0&lc=z22ihjbzgvu4jv2elacdp43aoumy1uzht3jdjthhckpw03c010c
For that kinda money in the middle east without cooled seats??
Value of this appreciates when Johnny English wrecks it.  Bond will stick with the modified AM DB5.     ;)
Very underwhelming. Who would spend million bux for this - so basic inside.
I still prefer Mercedes Maybach always
Max price $400k. 1 Million ridiculous
I feel this car is max 200.000 $
Soft close trunk...kind of like in my 1971 Cadillac Fleetwood? Which had an 8.2 liter V8. Winning.
they will definitely need those heated seats in the middle east..
So is it worth 1 million bucks? Yes, ofcourse. Dude you pay for the rarity. Just the rarity.
1 mil for uncircumcised seat belt buckles
If you can only get it registered for show and display, does that mean you couldn’t drive it daily? Asking as someone looking to import a classic under those same rules. Also: someone else said it but now I can’t unsee it- that car looks scarily similar to the new Accord. Regardless- definitely not worth a million to me!
I’m sorry to give a bad review but let’s be honest : this car is ugly, visually unbalanced ... I’ve been following this channel since the beginning and always loved it (even though it is mostly European cars...) and I have to admit, you failed on that one by giving a very questionable review. I guess once you reach the top, it is hard to stay on top. It’s been a while now unfortunately. Back to this specific car : everyone is unanimous that it is terrible and outrageously overpriced. Soft closing trunk ? It’s been on cadies in the 70’s, fbodies etc, a carmin gps ? Glass to separate both windows? Really? How about that engine ? What about that horrible paint job? Etc Someone famous said : “as the world is getting richer, people are lacking taste”... and objectivity if you ask me.
Tbh I thought it was cool until I heard the price imma just get a BMW or any other sedan damn might aswell get a Toyota
Soft close, not automatic trunk, non reclining rear seats, crappy navigation system, and a completely asinine price tag, no ventilated seats?
Does anyone else thinks it’s a problem that manufactures think doors that you can use as doors is a luxury feature?
This is maybe the ugliest sedan I've seen, and that's saying a lot considering a lot of the cars coming out
11:51 Damn I'd be looking at that hand stitched leather EVERY DAY
Ford mondeo concept 😑😑😑
8:27 ta.ra.f not  tu.ra.f that's the correct pronunciation of the arabic word of luxury
Mercedes: laughs in maybach
Thanks for the vid, I will run to the Rolls Royce factory to order a phantom and cullinan.
Another collector's item 😎
6 litre and only 530hp lmao
Exclusivity is the word you were looking for.
Douglas, blink twice if the cameraman has a Galil ACE
Idk if I'd want giant child seat anchor logos on my seats in a million dollar car
Why does this have the same amount of features... actually, a little bit less than my 2014 Lincoln MKS...
My BMW Alpina B7 is a lot better than this for sure! and looks better too. Those shocks in the doors copy from BMW 7 series doors
Turn signal on the fenders are too old school actually. A lot of old cars are using it. Plus RR is way too better than this. Will spent a million to a RR than this. Plus it does not look even good bruh. Audi cars are better looking than this. Plus steering wheel looks awful. Especially the dashboard bruh. The car looks like stuck in 2005. This car should price for only 80grand
Doug. I am typing this from a fugue state of varying degrees. I really, REALLY need you to get a better wardrobe and shoes for doing these videos, man. Go to UNIQLO or something. Burn those cargo shorts. Buy some nice socks from Heel Tread. GET NEW FUCKING SHOES. Dude. You are a good man, and you do great things. Dress like it. It's 8:03pm. I'm going to bed.
10:05 Woah doors that stay in place ! Here $1 million dollars 😍😍
0.38 big stuff on the way 😏😏👌👌🤩🤩🤩
First review in a long long time where I didn't agree with Doug on basically anything. Aston Martin must be paying a lot of money for this.
How the heck is a million dollar 2018 car still using a single clutch transmission? Yikes
I loooooove when manufacturers charge you an insane amount of money just because they decided to make a couple hundred models of something that they already offer. And then they call it "exclusive", "rare", "special" and my favorite cliché: "A modern classic". Lol! I could see this being 100k more than a Rapide. But 1 million? Please... Do you really want something special? Get a Gemera. (Yes, it will probably be close to 2 million, but when you are spending 7 figures in a car, the figures don't really matter...)
No Doug. It is a disappointment automobile.
Eh...Tesla’s look better 🤷‍♂️
Wait a few years It will be like 30.000 $
Doug: The gauge cluster is beautiful, and the tachometer runs the wrong way which is Aston's hallmark, it's neat.  Me: That's the most outdated and non configurable gauge cluster you can ever get in 2020, that looks more like a 2008 Accord gauge, at $1million price point.
10:05 Doug explaining how the door stays in any position... as the door is not staying in position. I’d take the fully specced phantom and use the rest on a pista
10:20 So the trick is basically just having a door with and slap hydraulic on it? It looks stupid for $1 Million car. At least put some effort to hide the hydraulic.
It's average at best.
This car is a joke... Maybe 20k
"Exclusivity"!
Doug pranked us!! This car isn’t real, it was a concept car a few years ago!
Is this some kind of sarcasm?
Anyone who buys this new is gonna learn a hard lesson in depreciation.
1 Million Dollars, reliability can be an issue.....ROFL !
If this car is worth 1M, how much is worth this half hour of my life that I just spent looking this stupid video?
Personally I don't think ANY automobile is worth a million dollars no matter how rich you are, but just going by reviewed cars from Doug this is not the best car seen no matter how "rare" it is. If I had the money, this car would be skipped because of how it looks, sorry 😞
Everybody gangsta until Aston Martin showed up with its own luxury brand
iPads killed The Whole luxury vibe
Looks like a genesis
I like how he teased the centinario review. Can't wait for that video
Doug won’t at least comb his hair before he reviews a million dollar car
Maybe worth 100,000$ !
What year was this car?
Doug in 2030= here's why lagonda is ultra luxury bargain
Finally a car I can afford
is it just me or does the back of the car look like it’s from a video game
What was the lambo at the beginning?
loving the teasers keep it up
Im getting Quartz Regalia vibes from the front of this car
This car just shouldn't be worth 1 million dollars. When I first saw it I thought it would be around $250,000 not because of the features but because of the name Aston Martin
I’m taking to rolls over this anyday
Looks like a slightly sleeker and modernized Cadillac DTS
I think they added an extra 0 to the price tag by mistake. 🤔
Thissss is like when your favorite fire meme page starts posting onlyfans chicks.
My Bmw 5 series  has soft closing doors 😆
Fancy Cars that go very fast you know they never last no no....I wonder if that dizzy bitch Madonna still wants to blow up the White Castle😄
you can get a 2017 mercedes maybach with all this & even more for 1/10th of the price LMAO
Waiting patiently on the Nissan Maxima review
It’s looks like the owner of this car had a gan pointing on him 😂
“Thhhiiiissssss!”
no sun roof?   pass
That don't look like $1M dollars to me.
Not my cap of (way overpriced) coffee.
Aston Martin is my absolute favorite car manufacturer, but this looks just like a Genesis.
Would rather get a Rolls Royce wtf
Will take the 8 series BMW all day long  🤘🏻💯
Meh.  Gotta say it, hard pass for me.  Exclusivity be damned.  I’m usually right with you on the Doug Score man, but not this time.  I think it’s a very nice looking car, but not even close to a 10 imo.
For a glimpse it looks like a Fusion, and I really hate to say it but a Fusion got better lines, and I can deal with it if we where not talkin' about a MILLION bucks car...
26:06 sorry doug but this car looks like any other sedan, like if a kia optima and ford fusion were mixed it would be this. doesnt deserve a 10 in my opinion i feel like this review was biased and the aston dealer may just really need to sell this
Your Oil better be selling like hotcakes in Middle East before you buy this car.....
Daddy Doug dementia time
Only car in production with a full functioning grill
For $1 million dollars, the only thing that's making all of the value is the damn leather. Just when they thought a scorching or freezing car wasn't enough...
I think people are missing the point. the ridiculous cost is part of the appeal. the Arab oil barons buy this BECAUSE it is $1 mill and not many have one.  anyone questioning the value proposition is certainly NOT the market.
This is nice looking, but I don’t think it’s the most beautiful car ever. And it’s certainly not worth 1 million dollars. It’s very nice but I think the Phantom is just better, even if it’s not sporty.
Honda accord and dodge charger front end
doug been savin this.. this car came up 3-4 years ago i could swear.. on top gear or somethin like that
Eh...just give me a Bentley Flying Spur, or Rolls Royce Ghost II, and I'll still have $600,000+ to waste on other things.
Nor worth 20000 to me
Matte black is a terrible color for this car
1 million $ worth of FUGLY.  Money cannot buy good taste.
Basically a million dollars for a redesign of the old car. Kind of lame. Wish they done more upgrades
Shame this car's matte finish...
$1 Million Dollar Car In this Era  doesn't even have an infotainment system...
take a shot every time Doug says DISTINCTIVE
Looks like its straight out of GTA
I would rather stick with my Camry than this car lol
"this car is the most beautiful four door car on earth" as he shows the front that looks exactly like a ford focus
Gonna be honest...those iPad brackets look tacky as fuck.
That keyhole in the drivers door really ruins the lines.
Anyone else see a ford fusion in this? I mean, pretty similar face and tail...   Also seems like another case of buying the name and the car comes with it. You can buy the most perfect Cadillac CTS-V with maybe 100 miles for a fraction of a price with (in my opinion) a way better looking exterior, plenty of safety and luxury to go around for all and... (smacks lips) that beautiful supercharged V8. Other than the hood up, this car to me just seems too similar to other sedans going down the road, I kinda feel like this will be one of those cars Doug reviews in like 8 years when it's depreciated to only 100,000 dollars.
Everyone complaining that this car isn't worth a million dollars and that Doug is trying too hard to defend its price clearly didn't watch the full video before posting a comment.  At 25:00 he goes over the fact that it's a parts bin car from Aston and Ford with objectively beautiful styling.  The cost as he mentions comes from the fact that it's entirely exclusive.  Rolls-Royce are dime a dozen in Beverly Hills and are boring to see over an over.  The Lagonda? There's one of them, maybe two, and that's worth the price tag to some folk.
Hand stitched leather with a wrinkle in it.
Doug was definitely paid to  review this car
This!!!...is a 2020 Honda Accord Ultimate Edition. No seriously look at the front end of the car.
It's not long enough
Really!  It's not worth that kind of money and I've lost respect for you thinking it does. You're making excuses for so many impractical things on this car.
This car is a joke, my Lexus is cheaper 10 times but 100% better
Raked windshield. .. Bet there will be someone with a rake to scratch the snob who buys 1 because there will be a shine that burns their yard and they are so upset.
“Most beautiful sedan ever made, 10/10 in styling”??????? Doug this is quite possibly the ugliest THING I’ve ever seen, let alone the ugliest car.... every single line of that thing is painfully awkward! Good god, man.
A fancy Honda Accord
Doug at the end of a first date: "Anyway now its time to GIVE THIS girl... a Doug score"
Not worth 1 million
Honestly I think it’s worth it
that looks like a Ford Taurus in the front and a Ford Fusion in the back.... def not a million-dollar car...
Calm down Doug...it looks like a Chrysler 300
Looks like all you're paying for is exclusivity. It doesn't even look that good imo.
Doug the type of guy to gawk at the manufacturer who's first to make a crystal turn signal stock.
Look like a long Honda Accord.. lol
Looks like a 10th Generation Honda Accord crossed with a Dodge Challenger.
Begging the government for permission to drive your car doesn't "make sense". It's right up there with "67 degrees Fahrenheit, Doug."
Doug must have had a gun pointed at him for this review
forgive me Car Enthusiasts: The side profile to the front of the Taraf reminds me of a Honda Accord.
Would rather have a fleet of 5 year old S63’s
Sorry Doug, leather looks warped here and there, that Garmin... not a million dollar car. But looks awesome.
10:03 Exactly where you want, except there.     It started to close.
This car in my opinion really isn’t that special looking on the outside. It just kinda looks like a gta car
No Apple CarPlay? No Android Auto?  Lagonda can’t afford it?   Hmmmm. Not worth it.
That 81 280Z with a 700 dollar bid?
I like how it looks, that's really it though, materials and features just doesn't justify the million dollar price
the grill has CSL's
Save yourself 30 minutes.. car costs $1,000,000 dollars for stitching and the lagonda badge. Doug really dropped the ball on this review
The image of this is that of the More Money Than Brains champ.
If it had a kia logo on it, he'd say it was ugly.
Very Nice. But 400k more than a Rolls Royce nice. Ehhh… Does even mater when your spending that?
Mr bond wants to buy he just made his bid with a lifetime of shaken ...not stirred martinis and a walther p38 9mm as a gift.
I didn't see the million dollars anywhere.
I’d still take a Phantom
Woo leather covered seat buckles? Here take my money 💀
I'd take a Rapide and save $940,000!
How is this such an exclusive car if they made 120 of them, and only a handful ended up in Europe? This means in Dubai they sold like 40 of them, so they keep bumping into each other on a daily basis.
Looks like an overpriced Hyundai genesis
Looks like a Ford Taurus Dodge Dart.
It has heated seats. Of course it does. It's an ultra luxury sedan. For Arabia.  Does it have cooled seats?
Designer: No one is buying the new Lagonda. My career is over. CEO: Change the name to Taraf. Price it at $1M and dump it in the Mideast...problem solved.
Exclusivity for sure .. very elegant .. this is a big boy’s car .. along with the Feadship and Gulfstream ! Perfect !
Grade de HB20 tsctsc
people deadass hating in this car like bruh it’s literally 1 of none no duh it’s gonna be a million dollars
It's beautiful but not $1m beautiful, I mean if u think it's the most luxurious interior ever look at the s600 pullman
How many times do I have to explain this? Having a specific temperature in an automotive climate control is moronic. Not having a little readout that says "67 degrees Fahrenheit, Doug" is not something to giggle about like a cutting edge oxygen deprived critic puppy.  That's not how cars work. That's not how heat works. That's not how thermal comfort works. That's not how people work.
1. The new Audi tailights are way cooler than the ones in this car. 2. The front looks like the new Honda Accord 3. You said "this era" and its a 2018 car, garbage security, infotainment and innovation 4. The doors fell two times when you said the thing about the staying there  This car doesn't worth anywhere near 1 million. Should be like 100,000$ or something like that. Disappointing car, hoped the best of the best hearing 1 million dollar pricetag.  And it looked like a paid review, so much trying to justify the pricetag.
This shiets not worth anything more than 250k 😂
I also think this car is beautiful but I expected a futuristic bespoke interior. Instead, a Ford Focus stalk, a steering wheel with gross shortcut buttons like on a 2002 Lexus GS, no rear ventilated seats, no push-button start, no ACC/LKA/HBA etc. you get standard on a Toyota, Lexus and some Hondas, a monochrome radio screen, no power trunk, no separated rear climate controls, no real infotainment system, no rear picnic tables, curtains nor sunshades. A Phantom has all of that and more. It belongs to the $200-300k range, not 1 million. But I even think a "simple" S-Class impresses more. A bit less noble materials, but way more luxury and modernity overall.
I would rather buy 2 base model rolls royce than this million dollar honda accord.  Actually 3 base model rolls royce
Well still not as good as a Rolls-Royce phantom... LMAO
Yo thats a douchebag parking job.
Looks like a stretched honda accord
A million dollars shit which doesn't have BBA like safety/technology and name value as well isn't up to the match of RR/Bentley... Yet the most expensive sedan...
What's the margin on this? Like 90%? Overpriced af
Taraf, ultimate luxury in Arabic.  To the rest of world Tariff just means Tax.
It's nice, it's really nice looking but, A MILLION dollars ?  How many cars, of all types, you can buy a S-class (flagship benz), and a really fast car from any one(Labo, etc) , and buy a Lexus for a daily driver,  AND still have a few hundred grand left over...  It's nice looking, even If I had a billon the bank, the tech just too outdated for a car of this caliber..
It's the only one in North America?...  - Don Huayra is laughing
Who in the hell comes up those names?
just buy an S Class  save your time
"...other Aston Martins of this era." "...as a lot of cars from this era did." "...distinctive of other Aston Martin models of the time."  This era = two years ago.  Are you futureproofing your videos Doug?   Or are you time traveling in clothes that blend into any decade since the 80s? Is this what cars and bids is about? Are you going back in time and buying cars and selling them now?  So many questions Doug. So many questions.
This car is NOT beautiful..
Good looking, wonder if it really is that good in person?
Literally looks like something from gta.
I think a bright color will show its elegance even more.
Bentley is way i mean way too luxurious and better performance than this car 1million? No but it definitely doesn’t worth more than 200k.
This thing looks in every way like it shouldn’t cost a penny over $180,000.  Middle East market only indeed.  Doug, be honest about stupid cars; lotta folks here in the comments suspecting you were doing the dealer a favor here.
make a video of a toyota pickup.
This car isnt worth 1 mio
Yeah it's not worth a million but let's face it no-one who's even considering buying this is doing it for the value.  Personally, I like how it manages to channel some of the style of the old Lagonda while still looking very modern.
The front looks like a Mazda lmao
That has to be the shittiest way to adjust heated seats in the car industry yet Doug just looked over it like it was nothing...imagine if that was a feature in a BMW or something, he would have a 5 minute rant about it.
Honestly, I dont think it looks that good...
I'll take 6 RS7s please in different colors.  At least one in a matte finish.  I'll take my circles in sets of 4.
"Exactly" That's not what that word means.
Aston Martin depend only on propaganda .
This is definitely a failed attempt at a halo car. There's no way 20 years from now someone is going to be dying to buy a low production sedan. They should of made a coupe with the same styling.
the front looks like a ford focus and a honda accord had a baby
This thing has no features for such a price. The only value it has is its rare.  The old lagonda at least took risks with the design and digital tech. This is a joke. Looks like an accord
The new Genesis G80 is arguably a better looking and as competent car at 1/20 of the price....
This car is a joke !
Hey random person scrolling down the comments..    Have a pleasant evening  :)
Yeah let’s see if he responds.
Looks like Honda Accord mixed with charger on the front end
Doug: This is the most beautiful blah-blah-blah Me:  Kinda looks like Sebring
I made harlem shake in super Mario maker 2 come watch it
Looks like a generic GTA car
Overpriced af....I'd rather have the volvo s90
Not having a distinct separate light for a turn signal is not luxurious, it is hazardous. I understand, they both end in "ous". You got confused. No sweat.
Thissssss.... LMAO
He made a lot of excuses for this thing...not a million dollar car
Who else remembers Doug trashing Maserati Ghibli for costing more than other midsize luxury cars and being down on features? Now all the sudden features and price doesn’t matter. He’s justifying the price by saying it’s incredibly beautiful.  1. The Rolls Royce Phantom and Bentley Flying Spur are both very close to as good looking, if not better. The flying spur is a lot faster and both the Flying Spur and Phantom have insane features.   2. Even the Ghibli offered unique things like insane exhaust note, exclusive Ferrari built engine, looks way better than other midsize luxury cars, and is far more exclusive than cars like BMW 5 series and Audi A6 that are everywhere.  I’m seeing double standards here. For a $1M this car should have at bare minimum had basic features instead of cheating out on aftermarket looking iPad holder and “soft close” trunk. Hell, for a millions dollars this car should have introduced several game changing features.  Your double standard is ridiculous. Hold all cars to the same standard.
You can have a good taste and an 1000$ car.
It’s more expensive than a Roys Roys and Lombargine machine.
Looks like a little bit more expensive mazda 6, but designer not very well do his job. 😂
Its hideous! And a total rip-off!
This is the Ford Fusions rich uncle
The most I’d buy this car for is 180,000$ that’s what it’s worth   ...   I wouldn’t even buy it for that amount if I had the money 😅😔
well it sure af aint more prestigious than a RR or bentley
How come there is no sunroof?
Absolute garbage. 🤬
Centenario Roadster review coming up???
The speedometer is in kilometers per hour, not in the US measurement system, bald eagles per glazed donuts
Gorgeous car.
$1 million for a Ford turn signal stock
Nice car to have fun in if your a fanatic of super fast and luxurious foreigns
The front lights remind me of a bmw i8
Who's Centenario Roadster was that Doug
Develops a car exclusive to the middle east, but don't forget the umbrella!
A million dollar car that looks like honda accord, not to mention it is wayyy overpriced. I seee why anybody takes a base modle rolls royce phantom anyday over this thing
The color is very unfortunate.
Wtf is a “soft close”? My relatively cheap 2019 Lincoln MKZ has a fully power operated trunk open and close feature. Soft Close is what my 2006 Lexus GS had. $1M and they couldn’t even give full power trunk.
At least you can hide that nav screen.......
So if they only made 22 Honda Civics, would they be worth $1 million?
Garmin GPS and iPads not included. Atrocious.
I find the rear windshield is too steeply angled, kinda messes with the cars lines. Needs window tint badly.
Your have to have more money than brain cells to spend a million on this thing.
I think the simplistic elegance of the exterior is absolutely stunning
After saw his video  Aston Martin :- that's to many features even we don't know apart of leather
One of the most stupid and overpriced car I've ever seen.
If this car cost 1 million,  well the BMW 7 series is worth 5 milion
My Ford Ranger has a dual clutch transmission and this $1,000,000 car has a single clutch? What a ripoff
This car looks like the child of a Ford Taurus and Bender
im not sure why people are disliking because of the car, its not like doug made it.
I didn't even know this car existed
Absolutely the most disappointing car I’ve ever watched. A single clutch trans from 2003, are you fucking kidding me? The rear seats don’t recline? No cooled seats? No power trunk? This is insanity. Not to mention I figured it would have well over 600hp...
Regarding its "beauty..."  I clearly don't see it the same way as Douglas.  This car looks horrible.
I'm gonna kill my self there is no sun roof in a 1kg, sorry Doug I can't trust you any more
Lord....my Audi E-tron is faaaaaaarrrrrr more luxurious than this for less than 1/10 of the sales price of the Lagonda......and that's awful
I’m sorry everybody, it looks like it could be the new Ford Fusion 😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️
Front end is 100% the love child of a ford fusion and dodge charger
It’s a beautiful car but NGL if I had the budget I would rather get a phantom and save the rest for another car
Doug!!! I'm your neighbor here in SoCal and I could have helped you with HOW you pronounce TARAF. As you said, it is Arabic for luxury, but it is pronounced like butter or cutter NOT tarAAAf :)
WORTH A MILLION DOLLARS.....HOW.......BULLSHIT....
@doug how much did the dealer pay you to sweet talk? I say that because a car like this specially with the price tag... you wont be umm lets say so nice to it...
Looks like a luxurious ford fusion
No offense but the front of this car remind me of the Honda Accord
I need a top trump deck based off your score board..
I'm sure this car will end up in Tim Cook's or some other MEGA rich celebrity's garage. Not even kidding!!
Let's be real. This vehicle looks so good because of the matte black paint. Pretty easy to replicate.
Most beautiful??? Really!!! Now I know why I don’t respect the Doug score
Doug says you will never encounter a car this beautiful. Well we will see in the future.
wheels have been replaced! WTF
This  car is a joke my brothers 2006 G11 750Li has more comfort features than this million dollar car.
It really looks that the front of one of those "Genesis" South Korean cars. I definitely prefer the face of other Aston models.
I'd maybe give it a 7 in the looks category.  Sorry, I just don't see it being a 10.  Volvo makes a much better looking sedan
I would always get a Flying Spur over this (also it’s more than 3 times chipper than this crap)💩
Did anyone else notice that the grille looks like the genesis g90
Stop it Doug. This car is barely a 75k car at best. At 1,000,000 dollars. HELL NO! You tried your best to hype it up but it’s a major fail on your part. You are so biased towards European cars. I can think about 30 different cars I rather own than this POS
If I had one million to buy cars, I would definitely choose RR+Lambor then this one
"you don't have a million dollars"  Damn Doug why you hittin below the belt like that bro
That thing is gorgeous! I can only imagine how wonderful that interior must smell with all that high quality leather. 👃🏻
This car will be worth less than $100K in 7 years.
Please stop touching the paint!! It makes me crazy when he puts his arm on them!!! Other then that best videos
9:57 That was a shitshow
Doug, for the first time I’m tempted to believe you’re just making up several excuses for this car, considering the price tag... Do you remember the very things you said about the LX570? Do you see the exposed key lock hole on the door? $1M? This review is below the Doug standards sir..
Drinking game: Everytime he says "lagonda" take a shot 😂
It looks like a gennisis g90
Idk about this one Doug I'm sensing some Aston-Martin bias
That's an UGLY car, no idea how they messed that up, but they sure did.
The front of that Aston is way too similar to a Honda Accord.
what a strange looking ford fusion
Wow lots of haters, I love it.
I do not agree this car is worth 1million even not worth 100k
A dirty left knee on crazy expensive leather center console 😂
Looks nice but plain... If prefer the rolls-royce suv
"take a look at the db9 grille" *inserts picture of virage*
This looks like a Ford Taurus from the front
After this, im asking Toyota to import a century for me.
To some people the difference between 100k and 1M is practically nothing. For those people a million dollar Sudan seems appropriate as getting a 600k rolls would be cheaping out.
So it’s a $200,000 - $250,000 car (and not even worth even that price) but instead of making it a full model and trying to sell it  they decided to make it super limited and sell it in the Middle East because people there don’t actually buy cars because they’re good cars but because they’re exclusive and no one else has them. Am I getting this right?
this thing is hideous
@10:12 A "hydraulic?"  REALLY Doug?  You run an automotive channel with 3.7M followers, and you call a gas strut "a hydraulic."  What the fuck goes through your mind all day?  I guess only quirks and features.
Anyone else thinks this is a btech overpriced challenger?
The wheels remind me of the S60 polestar
probably the rarest car doug has reviewed
ehhhhh looks like the new Genesis from the front
meh..
Who were the mental cases that actually bought that thing?
And Aston is wondering why they're losing money
It looks like regalia from ffxv
interior is bland and it doesnt even have a digital gauge cluster
No, the most expensive sedan is Rolls Royce Sweptail....
Uncircumcised seat belt buckles
Not impressed at all
Why does he keep saying "from this era" and similar phrases, if this car was made in 2018? Surely he got the year incorrect or he wouldn't be saying that. It's very nice looking, but even if I had $500 Million, I wouldn't buy one. Just not worth it.
Regular car = "roof"  Million Dollar car = "ceiling"  (pay no attention to the dirty knees)
This was a cash grab by Aston Martin. I did like how they kept the proportions of the previous Lagonda with the short trunk.
So what do I get for a million bucks?            Aston Martin: “We’ve replaced all Aston Martin logos with Loganda logos”.                     Is that it? “Yep.”
This is an ugly, dated, and transparent pandering to the Middle Eastern market where the price tag is the only quirk and feature.
They charged a million bucks to cover the high cost of production for a small number of units. It doesn't reflect the actual value of the car.
Ok but the average person won’t know you spent $1M on this car. You’d be better off with a 2020 Rolls-Royce Phantom, Mercedes-Maybach or a Mercedes S Class which in my opinion is more luxurious than this Auston Martin pos. Anyway, who ever purchases this car is a sucker and just didn’t look around.
Trump should allow you to review the presidential vehicles. That would be fun, and classified of course!
That metal clunky sound at 24:15 repeated couple time after again when steering wheel is turned is a car feature too?
What about the loud ass clunk at 24:16
I really was respect you before you made this joke, how much did you get to made this silly video 😂, please tell me who's need a heated seats in the fu**ing middlest, what is the fu**ing umbrella doing in the desert, what about after market cooling box, who's gonna keep his children in a such loganda they just try to copy the RR but they can't do you know why!!!  because they are cheap and they will still, finally for your records its just a mixed between Genesis and Fusion its not beautiful at all, my advice to you is to get retired and stop doing this shit
Yeah... Id rather have 2 phantoms At least I can always sell one and use the money to buy a 2nd house
Not buyin a million dollar car for a luxury key.
Nothing about this car is a million dollar worthy. awful
Losing credibility Dougie....be careful.
front looks like a 2020 honda accord lol
This was click bait...most beautiful sedan ever? Nope. Technologically advanced? Nope. Worth a million dollars? Nope. Don't do this again Doug, this was obviously an overhyped car.
The steering wheel is disappointing...
He definitely getting a commision if this sells. One of his more biased reviews. I get it though.
They must of paid Doug a lot of money for this review👀
He talks about a 2018 Aston Martin like it's a 1976 Cadillac What "era" is this, Doug?
That looks like a honda accord w a cheap paint job and swapped badges lol
How much did they pay  bro
If I saw Doug wear a collared shirt I swear to you I would doo doo all over myself
A million for a car without an infotainment system? I don't think iPad holders is what you'd expect in a luxury sedan of this price.
Comments disabled on this video in 3...2...1...
I drew a similar design at the front a while back. Guess someone thought the same way.
lol The center console looks like it from 2008. I have to rolled back the video to double confirm it's 2018 model year.
Anyone remember that "I Am Rich" app that was listed for the maximum price allowed on the app store?  ...yeh
okay doug imma need you to stop talking about cars and bids in the vids, like fr
Me: buys two Tarafs just so there are fewer people who have any. It sure is unapologetically beautiful. In a manly way.
Ugly as sin.  It's a Hyundai Genesis crossed with a Dodge Charger don't think the rest of us haven't spotted that.  You just lost 100% credibility with Doug score styling .
Buy a Rolls Royce, its better and cheaper
I promised myself I wouldn't ask you to consider reviewing the new Chevy Blazer RS...  _I failed_
Cool car
I feel like this specific one was made for MKBHD
But what's with the Chiron body kit on that Lamborghini?
Hi Doug.  Take a look, please, Nissan Maxima 2015-2020.  I'm from Russia.  We have this model is very rare.  Even on used-cars sites there is only ONE!! offer for the whole country 🙂  Thanks !! PS: I will leave this comment under each of your videos until you answer yes or no 🧐🙂
Doug must have the world's strongest pair of knees
Bruh, that car looks cheap
You can tell he was trying so hard to make it seem like a good car. He kept saying things were “strange” instead of terrible. If this was a mazi he would have torn it to shreds
1 M for this ?  Leheheheheh there is nothing there worth it 0.5M.
It looks like a Dodge Charger
Doug, the Rapide is better looking by far!
Congrats Doug! You are #27 on trending! Keep up the good work!
For this price this car better come with 4000 horsepower.
Font end is a Ford Taurus 😆
0:38 didnt knew that cars can make cosplay of other cars... Lol  22:00 Come to think about it... It's raining and You are the driver of your luxurious extra expensive lagonda taraf... Then You need to use your umbrella so You exit your car to get yourself and your tailored suit wet so you get your umbrella in the back to use it  ... yeah.. first world problems...
I can only assume it's beautiful because of its price tag. If that was a Hyundai then you may have a different opinion. This is just not a good looking car
I have a million dollars, but choose not to spend it on a grossly overpriced car.
*Customer:* So, I'm paying 1 million dollars. What do I get? *Aston Martin:* Leather. *Customer:* Leather and what else? *Aston Martin:* L    E    A    T   H   E   R
I'm not impressed
Nice Lincoln MKZ.
Just  saw Scotty shaking his head, which means 'money pit.'
Sure, it's a very nice car, a beautiful car, even. But it's also five times more expensive than it should be.  Even if it was $150-200k, you could market this as a competitor to Bentley and Maybach, and it might have done well.  As it is, you're paying for a drivable concept car. Which is fine, but I wish we'd get this much styling effort for a production model.
Aston Martin, as beautiful as they are, tends to underwhelm everywhere else. I’d keep the money and get an S Class or Merc-Maybach. Plus nobody is gonna ask what kind of ski equipment a Lagonda is
can you review the koeniggsegg jesko next
The front looks like accord, well better but similar
can't wait to see this on the road so i can rear end it with my 2001 honda accord
When are you going to review the Bronco?
I wanna see that blue Lambo at that start
I love that Kripparrian is branching out from Hearthstone. He's doing a good job reviewing epic cars.
Looks like a glorified Ford Fusion. Awful.
This car must be on cars and bids, because this seems totally like a sales job by Doug. This thing is not that great looking(especially that ugly ass grill), doesn't have many features of cars that are sub 100k, and has to be someone at Aston's joke to see how gullible people could be.
I can buy 10 S550s for the price of this and it’s features are so basic.
I would expect a car like this so cost 200k at most. Nothing warrants it to be any more than that...
$1m? Yawn. Rapides can be had for $60K. Better looking? Maybe, but an interior that is "a little bit better than a Rapide" is worth 20 times as much????? Fail. And, Yawn
Imagine spending $1,000,000 on a car and finding out that the #1 definitive measure of a car's greatness, the Doug Score, says the guy who passed you on the highway in a 2018 BMW 760 he bought slightly used for $65,000 has a better car than you.
Damn Doug really kissed this car’s ass. It has a GARMIN GPS SYSTEM (!!) and the same engine as the Rapide and he doesn’t shut up about ‘exclusivity’ and ‘rarity’. Weak!
Doug face has changed and it makes me uncomfortable
2:00 lol lowkey called America’s broke😭
Nah way way overpriced just get a lexus sedan and there you go.
that is definitely the most beautiful sedan ever but $1,000,000!!! What kind of highway robbery is that?!?!? Instead of that I would get a Rolls Royce Phantom (not the Cullinan because it looks stupid) and an Aston Martin DBS Superleggera. I also guarantee that the Phantom would turn more heads than the Taraf. But the Taraf is still a seriously cool car just not $1,000,000 cool.
Elegant as. I just don’t understand the choice of red calipers and matte paint.
Is that a beautiful car? Undoubtedly. Did Aston Martin have to screw something up on the way? Of course and it was to be expected. Control panels? Cheap and unimpressive. Main console taken out of 2007? There it is. But basic wheel and turn signal stick from compact car? That's just a lazy rip off. Oh! But they covered seatbelt buckles in leather! What an attention to detail!
Hi Doug, long time fan, but I can only imagine your commission once you sell this monstrosity. I do get that it is a beautiful car. Still, you cannot say with all your heart that this is the best luxury car going above a RR. You know those cars are built to a level of quality next to none, at least not one that AM can produce.
The car is so fast, the damn paint flew off
this is the best looking car i have ever seen
It looks like an uber 😂😂
......he had *TO KNEEL DOWN TO MATCH THE HEIGHT OF THE DOOR*
Taraf means legacy not ultimate luxury.
this thing is ugly compared to other cars in this price point it looks like it tried to be a modern aston in the front and a weird rolls royce in the rear and he keeps saying for the era but its only max 3 years old its not old also it doesnt even have ventilated seats in the rear or massaging seats cheap navigation and saying thats all they had is not good enough they could have deffinetly used at least something by ford or created their own and the stereo for a 2018 looks like its from 2006 basically its looks old cheap and i wouldnt even pay 40K for this volvos or base model mercedez and even toyotas from this "era" have more tech and better features
For a million dollars it should have fully reclining, massage, and heated; cooled seats.
Nope
The front looks like the 2019 Accord, for ONE MILLION DOLLARS
Doug is on the precipice of watering a plant so it grows and drowning it, wondering where it went all wrong. I’m referencing cars and bids... let it grow man! Relaxxxx on the intro ads.
I think Toyota makes a more impressive luxury car than this (as far as quality goes).
I'm surprised that this million dollar car has the identical wheel design as my 2015 VW Polo GTI. I would have expected that Aston Martin designs something unique for this exclusive car instead of copying the wheels from a mass production VW?
You know
I wouldn’t even price this car at 100k let alone a million. That’s just insane to me 🤦🏽‍♂️
Simply put, if you ask how much, you can’t afford it.
I'll save you 30 minutes of your life. It's a Range Rover Autobiography but in sedan form and cost a million dollars.
I wouldn’t call that gorgeous. Looks like a Ford Fusion in the front.
The grill looks like Hyundai's
I’m surprised how few elite luxury features it has. Is it made up by the quality?
Rolls Royce "sweptail" was 16 million dollars..
Not saying that wasn't the price, but I wonder what it would have been if they had decided to sell elsewhere. Selling to Arab oil/government billionaires? You jack the price because you can.
Wow Doug is seriously drinking the cool aid here isn't he... The styling is clearly modeled after the original Aston Martin of the '80's which he called ugly...AND I'm sure if this exact model was a Buick being sold for $30k he would say how boring and ugly it is
Everbody: It isn't worth it Me: Are we going to just ignore the fact that he reviewed a Centenario Roadster Personally, it looks cool and sleek
Some say he wears two t-shirts and he laughs at his own jokes. All we know is he's called Doug.
Take a shot of alcohol every time he says Lagonda.
They just priced it at $1 million because they can not because its worth anywhere near it.  2 Phantoms worth of luxury sedan and it doesn't even look any more special than a 7 series.
this to can be found on cars & bids!!!
Looks like an accord lmao
Cool car but imagine paying 1 mill just to pop the hood to see the amazing v12 just to find plastic
No
That paint job is 👌
For $1M, they couldn't hire a team of developers to develop some high tech unique user interface on special tablets?! "Oh yeah just stick on some $250 Ipads that should do the trick." What a crap product for such price and expectations.
Perhaps together... the Aston Mak'Tar Chant of Strength: Larak taraf, larak taraf, Larak Taraf!
Ford Taurus. Lagonda Taraf. Turn signal stalk from a Ford Taurus. Capless fuel receptacle like a Ford Taurus. Yep. Basically a Ford Taurus.
Looks like an elongated ford fusion
Whats that noise at 24:16?
My 2011 Sienna is more luxurious than this
Headlights look like a BMW i8 from the side
Doug forgot to mention you can’t put more than 2500 miles on it annually because of the import laws
It’s probably the ugliest Aston Martin in my opinion
This car should be 100k max
It also have MPH below KMH on speedometer BTW
No open roof??
$1 million? Pagani Zonda is in that range and all of the switches and controls are made of machined aluminium.
So expensive but still not as nice as a Rolls Royce or a maybach
Sorry, the Phantom is a much prettier car and I couldn't imagine many people disagreeing.
all the proportions are wrong. when looking at the side, the back end looks like a dodge challenger. I usually agree with Doug's taste in styling, but I honestly think this car is ugly as fuck. It looks like there were different designers for the front and rear halves of the car.
Lamborghini Centenario confirmed!
I would rather own a one 77 if I had to choose. They both are a million!
I mean... The car is cool and all but 1 million?????? People who buy it really just wanna say they had a million dollars to waste
Garbage 🗑
Yeah, gonna have to disagree; it looks like a mid-80's Oldsmobile to me. I'd say the new Flying Spur is much better looking. That this didn't get a 1 for value makes me wonder if Doug lost his mind; the only reason this car exists is to extract money from the house of Saud. It's common switchgear, wheel off a Dodge SRT, and what looks like a Pep Boys flat black wrap. Ewwww. Yuck.
Without question, one of the top five ugliest sedans of all-time. The new Camaro looks better.
Neat car
I'm sorry but if a car is $1M, IT MUST BE BULLETPROOF. Literally. And look at how much crap is carried over into this car!? So much recycled shit. It must be UNIQUE AF at $1M.
Mate black 😍
Some of the many quirks and features of the Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf are that it has...  ... four wheels. That's right, count them. Four... wheels. And an engine.  :-P
Where is the beautiful, spectacular look of the car Doug's mentioning multiple times?
Its still trash
I think it's cool how they've managed to capture the original's vibe while updating it completely
Feels like Doug is trying not to insult the owner of that overpriced *thing* so he can review some other rare cars.  Tsk.
Overpriced
Doug is the type of guy to review the outside of the car wearing shorts then get into the car and potentially dirty the interior with those dirty knees .. every time .. smh
I am Arabic and never knew taraf means ultimate luxury
A C class is prolly more luxurious
Never knew this existed. That’s rare for me.
If the Navigation system was up to date and that leather was white... oh yeah The red calipers look a lil out of place too Nice work as usual Doug 😎
Taraf in arabic is pronounced quickly with very short a's.
The Lagonda is kinda ugly tbh.
This isn't a car you drive, this is a car you get driven in.
all i see is leather ..
You can buy those little coolers for $50 from anywhere and plug them into the cigarette lighter and save yourself about a million dollars.Not to mention that a well-equipped Hyundai has more features than this thing.
Doug, I'm really thinking in send you a pair of knee pads......
Total meh.
If I bought this car for 100k, I'd still feel like I got ripped off
It reminds me of all those 2010's Maserati's with the shitty plastic and the sticked on iPad's, just that it costs  10 times more
Doug was paid for this review!
Did you ever design a car? Is it easy because you seem to make it look easy to mock other people's hard work in this video! And sorry to say you are only 32 yo but you look 52!
It's true it's the most expensive and luxurious Hyundai charger sonata ever.
Honestly, if I had the money I’d be perfectly happy paying around 300-350k for this. 7 figures for a sedan is just asinine. If Aston Martin lowered their ego just a little bit and expanded their line up to have 2 sedans comparable to the ghost and the phantom from the likes of Rolls Royce, I think they would sell very well. But then again with Bentley getting rid of the Mulsanne luxury sedans are probably not long for this world unless they are electric.
As an Arab im pretty sure they did the name “Taraf” so wrong with this one lol the front of the car looks like a fucking taurus
I had sex in the back of one of these,it was a million dollar experience
It looks like a stretched Honda Accord from the front
Hell  naaaaw
Lagonda means like a Long Snake  A very long snake
😂
That Lamborghini thou 😍😍😍
2 custom lamborghinis or the magic door Aston martin.. This is gonna a tough one 🤣
For me, RR phantom is still much more beautiful and valuable than this car
Can i request the maybach 62s😄😁
I might be wrong, but i think this car is actually going to devalue over time. Exclusivity for exclusivity's sake is not enough if you want to associate prestige to a limited edition. I love Doug's videos, but after half an hour of video... I don't get the million dollar price tag.
The Honda Accord looks vaguely similar and they called that ugly.
Pile of crap
Carandbids is crap
when u say: carsandbids is the best website to sell cars, i hear its the worst website to buy cars :D. seriously whats your plan to keep both ends happy?
Jesus, for $1M I would expect everything to be flawless with absolutely no shared switchgear from a Ford.
New Game: Take a shot every time Doug says Lagonda
I love the paint tho. Thats it
This hideous monstrosity is simply proof that Oil money can't buy class.  THAT'S the reason it wasn't sold elsewhere.  And to say it is more beautiful than the E38 7-series is downright insulting.
Ok, I realized Doug’s taste in cars diverged strongly from mine when he bought his G500 Cabriolet. But this is even worse! Different strokes for different folks I guess, or maybe I need to see it in person.   Anyhow, I would be hard pressed to pick this car out in a lineup with a matte black wrapped Ford Fusion fitted with red brake calipers. In fact, for the price you could buy a fleet of fifty matte wrapped Ford Fusions. At least then you’d know at least a couple of them would be working!
Aston Martin, the company blessed with the most beautiful design language of the ENTIRE automotive industry, where making a genuinely ugly Aston is seemingly impossible, somehow pulled that off.
Like how Doug probably has more viewers per month than top gear
As if it rains a lot in the Middle East... 😂
It’s ugly AF
Congratulations uv just been pranked 🤩
Ehh not feeling this at all and definitely not for a million. Looks kinda outdated tbh
Doug reviewing Lexus LFA: $400k for a car and it has regular old door locks?! Doug reviewing a Million dollar Aston: *...whistles loudly*
Will Doug review a Lambotghini Centenario?🤔
Isn't Aston Martins Rapid just literally Rapid, and not Rapeeeed
The reason why they don’t sell it in North America because no one would buy one million dollar looking  Honda Acord from the front. and I guess there are not that many Honda Acords in Dubai
Honda Accord is that you?
Lol Value 4 out of 10? Are you serious? This should be, if not the worst value car ever, Not more than a 2.
This video makes me going to buy a Genesis somehow
This thing is tops a 200k car lmao ford shit 80 dollar garmin bs and some fucking leather most of that price is from the engine lmao things wack
This is a 2018 what do you mean by “of this era” and “all they had at the time” my 2018 Ford Focus has a better infotainment system than that!
I stopped watching at ipads!
Is he reviewing a centenario next?
“taraf” means edge or point in arabic not ultimate luxury
Who else didn’t know this car existed
$1M???  I'm going back to Sarah n Tuned.  More my price point.
Front be looking like a Honda accord
Now THAT is a special edition car, as opposed to a 95 grand GMC pickup with badges all over it! Very cool and BEAUTIFUL car.
now THAT'S a thiss intro
I would take a phantom over this any day....
It’s not a single clutch gearbox. It’s the 8 speed ZF auto.
Looks like a chrysler
Aaaaand next up...Doug washed his knees before entering 1 million $ car...
These things on the dash board raising is not speakers. It’s noise canceling devices ....
1 mil for a luxury sedan that doesnt justify it.
This car doesn't cost more than 300k its way way overpriced for nothing this is bull****
Looks like a fancier accord lmao
I thought there was a 1.5 mil Mercades
The price is ridiculous but Doug explains it right. You could take a Rolls or Bentley or Rapide or S Class and spend $200k making it WAY fancier than this, but it won’t be exclusive.   Would I buy this car? Nope!
2020 Bmw 760i is way nicer looking
I know he isn’t paid off. So it means this is actually what he thinks about the car. If so... omg.  His weekend score has been crap
“ The most beautiful 4 door sedan ever made”.  Random Croatian laughing in the distance*.
I prefer a Rolls all day long
Bruh my 40,000 dollars opel/Vauxhall insignia has almost every feature in that car
“Aston Martin’s luxury brand.” As if the cars weren’t already luxurious... although this is absolutely not worth $1M.
the windows arent even tinted 😬
I am not going to say much, just remember how much crap you give other manufactures for having a key hole visible, but the lagonda since it belong to aston martin u didn't even notice it.
There is something missing about it
Accord x Challenger
Nice car.
The front end looks like a new gen accord lol
Only an Arab woul;d over pay for this shit box lol.
Rather just have a Lexus, 911, Jeep, RAM 1500, Honda Odyssey, Corvette, and change left over....
I actually think it looks pretty awkward:/
A shot every time Doug says lagonda taraf 😂
What was that sound that I heard 3 times? It's the same sound that I hear when a hammer hits an anvil, or when a fire extinguisher rolling around the floor and hitting something that is made of metal. Did he hit something with that million-dollar sedan?
Obviously helping OGara Coach offload this absurd car
"steeply ra*ed" had me cracking up im like bro use another word for peet's sake
If I had $1M I would hands down go get this....and then sleep in it
That car is maybe worth 200,000 new. If it’s worth 1 million dollars, I wouldn’t let a YouTube guy drive it. No offense Doug
The Best Feature for kids is the Door Locks to KEEP THEM OUT!!!
Front end looks like the Hardy Boys from South Park
16:26 the most luxurious black screw from lowe's in $1M car
Ugliest aston martin
Definitely not worth anything close to a million dollars. The taillights weren’t that cool. Have you seen newer Audi taillights?
Front end looks like a current gen Honda Accord
Is this the slowest V12 ever
Nice Honda accord
But in Mexico there is another Lagonda....    https://youtu.be/iml06xH1AQY
Bugatti EB112 is the most beautiful sedan. Hands down.
I don't think is worth the million, there are too many great car for less.
Need this in GTA V ONLINE
Why  would anyone buy that looks simple and boring could never compete with a rolls royce worth doesn't mean it would turn heads
That front end is a copy (fusion) of a copy (Aston Martin Vanquish)
So you pay 1 mil for a car that is very distinctive from other Aston Martin models?
"The most beautiful sedan in the world"?   Nah, I don't think so...
This car not worth. Near a million. He must got this on cars&bids with how he hyping it up
Every demuro vid feels like a paid advertisement. No matter how fugly and stupid the car and its features are, he seems to love everything about them.. and most of the cars are really fucking ugly and really fucking stupid.
If this car is most beautiful then therefore so is the latest Honda Accord with the similar front end
Is this a joke? For $1 million, you don't get adaptive cruise control or second row ventilated seats? The friggin Kia Telluride has both options! On top of that, you get a Ford stock, Garmin GPS (compare that to Audi's console), and not even a panoramic moon roof? Does this thing even have 360 degree camera? Is this the British trying to screw over the Middle East again?
Lights look like an accord and so does the front lol doug bases his favorite shit off price 😂
i honestly think it’s kinda ugly
That keyhole is ugly AF... and those wheels, so ugly and wrong for the car. Same with red brake calipers. But otherwise, beautiful lines.
Looks like Genesis in the front
Total rubbish!
man these companies are really taking the piss with these ultra expensive ultra exclusive cars that dont really give you as much as an ultra expensive ultra exclusive car at less than half the price.
$1mil for a 10year old interior rapide with an absolutely disgusting bodykit 😂😂😂 what drugs were they on lmao ONE MILLION 🤣
I thought Ford stopped making the Fusion? 🧐
"Look at this key!!! It's a rectangle with glass on top and it goes into the central console!!!" ... Like all Aston's..
Christ that’s UGLY... 😖
And people say the Camry looks like a fish? THIS LOOKS LIKE A FISH!!! LOOK AT THAT GRILLE!!!
So your telling me I can get 2 2020 Rolls-Royce Phantom or one of these Aston Martin Rapid for 1 million dollars⁉️😂🤷‍♂️
Is it just me or does the grill and headlights look like the new ram...??
Love the exterior look! Everything else is and looks better in a Rolls Royce!
This doesn’t look like a million dollars to me 🤔
So they leveraged the price tag on time- with only 120 in production, it can't help but to appreciate a lot within a decade- but we're not seeing anything new. Thanks, Doug.
The front end looks like the 2020 Honda Accord
I doubt you cant option a rolls higher than 600k. They will do anything you want to it.
“...dingle around...”
what a trash
Behold the million dollar Hyundai Genesis
Yeahhhh I'm taking a fully loaded S65 AMG for $260k over this please
16:10  all is great ... EXCEPT for those cheap Ford steering wheel controls & stalks, LOL... what were they thinking!!!  .. for a $1M car, everything bespoke please!!
This car isn’t 300k.
I’m just waiting for the part in the video where I understand why this car is worth 1m.
The similarity to the Genesis logo makes it look like a Hyundai up front. Which really makes Hyundais seem a lot nicer.
Dealership said " make sure you keep your sweaty arms on the car"... Car guys don't touch the paint...
Doug, you are “gorgeously beautiful.”
I’m Arab and this car doesn’t deserve to be named “Taraf”. The word is just too big for that Genesis.
The saddest excuse for a luxury car, any Mercedes or BMW under 100k would suffice more so than this. Outdated tech, severe lack of luxury, and no one knows this car, so no appeal.
First time I've ever disliked a Doug video. This car should have been destroyed, but it wasn't.
U can tell he was paid out to advertise this car lol.
First time seeing Doug being biased
Its basically a Rapide. Rapides only $50k used. Not worth $950k more for the lagonda name
My Ford Focus shares the same $1M Aston Martin Turn signals 😅
The next generation genesis looks alright.
Just gimme an S Class man. More luxurious, beautiful, and 10x cheaper
"You will not encounter another sedan this beautiful" . . . Um mr. Koenigsegg has a few words to say
Complete waste of a million dollars.... you can get a cadillac cts with more features smh pass
Do you know how many Kia Rios I can buy for the price of this thing?
Damn Doug, did you literally just wake up from your bed and put ur shoes on? Your hair is very telling of that. Your pillow hair is very extreme.
I think the opposite of beautiful. I think it's one of the ugliest sedans that exists. I rather buy a bunch of 2020 Toyota Camry. One for every day of the week before I buy one of these hideous things.
Looks like the new g80 lol
I dont get Doug, Its SO UGLY
3/10
*at least S Class got Soft closing doors*
https://www.ogaracoach.com/used/Aston+Martin/2018-Aston+Martin-Lagonda+Taraf-0501b0390a0e0ae73fbd571c5e7360a3.htm
So you mean to tell me a bunch of middle-eastern hipsters wanted a unique Ford Taurus.
what the hell this car isn’t worth twice as much as a rolls royce i would say this car is worth 150k at most
Can you review a 2020 C43 AMG?
Front end looks like a knockoff BMW i8
it's plain dreadful
Thanks Doug so much for finally giving a 4 door sedan a 10!  Although...it's grill could stand to be a bit smaller.  I'd give it a 9.  Funny, I designed a 4-door car that looked just like this when I was in high-school 23 years ago and had it priced at $42,000.  I guess Aston Martin had hidden cameras in my bedroom back then.  I really wonder why more sedans and SUVs don't offer a mini-fridge for like $400 extra....seems like it should be a viable option on any car at any price point.
“Most beautiful sedan I’ve ever seen”...something is definitely going on with Doug and this review that we don’t know about.
another overpriced British turdmobile. If you want real luxury get a German sedan or an Italian sports car
*$1M and doesn’t have Soft closing Doors*
Is Doug trying to sell this car for the dealer? This car isn't really appealing visually and for the price I could buy a $50k car every year for a life time and be just as happy.
Looks like a Ford Fusion to me
Never before saw a Doug video get so much hate... it was about time. Doug score has been a joke lately and now this sellout.
They charge a million dollars for it and can’t be bothered to have crafts workers hand build their switch work. Like all Aston Martins, the only thing this car does for the money is look the part.
Nice Ford Fusion you've got there
Aston Martin: *Builds million dollar car*  Dougscore: "Used Panamera is better."
what moron would buy this car  glorified rapide ...oh thats right just sold in the middle east   rich oil leaders who live ultra lavish lives while theyre populations starve
Its sell out reviews like this that make me want to unsubscribe.   You did this on that ugly Toyota rav4 as well.   I guess you've gotta pay for that Ford GT you bought.
The Way you lick your lips before opening the door says alot about how much you like the car
This car cost a million dollars for the sake of it. Don't get me wrong it's a nice car but I don't see a million dollars here, it doesn't even have a moonroof.
A million bucks, and you still have to dig the umbrella out of the trunk? Pfff. No blackout curtains??? Pfff. No picnic tables? Pfff. Plastic air vents? WTF? Hideous infotainmet center? Only 500 horsepower? OMG... Give up Aston Martin, you're out of your league. Who wouldn't rather have two Bentleys and a Rolls for the price of this thing?
It really does look like a stretched Maserati with a Aston Martin engine (Amg) and some nice stitching and leather that has a garmin smh 🤦‍♂️
Hyundai Genesis ripoff
Love to see Brian Cooley review this car.
I'm shocked that you didn't call out the leather in the spot when the ashtray is removed.  I was so surprised when you pulled the cup out and there was leather there.
If I showed you 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO with no badges on it and told you it was $50 million you would lose your shit, if you knew nothing about art and I showed you the Mona Lisa and told you it was $100 million you would lose your shit, if I showed you the Rolex Daytona Paul Newman which just looks like a regular Rolex and told you that was $18 million you would lose your shit. Exclusivity is worth a lot of money, people pay  millions for exclusive license plates and some guy just paid $300,000 the other day for a lucky phone number. 🤷‍♂️8 billion people on the earth, 120 of these cars. Think about how many rich people there are in the world, over 2,000 billionaires alone, so if 10% of the billionaires alone wanted this car they couldn't get it. The McLaren F1 was $800,000 new, if you told someone back then it would be worth $20 million one day they'd roll around on the ground laughing, they won't be laughing today.
Nowhere near as good looking as the Lagonda from the 1970-1990 era.
1 million and there's a key hole on the door, a Garmin GPS, Ford focus turn signal.... What!? Why
This video is sponsored by Aston Martin
Lol the front of the car looks like the new Honda accord.
Didn't the S class have that door hinge system as well? I remember being able to place it precisely where you want it just like this
Wonder how much junk you have to take off to change a spark plug.
Check this out!  There’s a $5 hydraulic shock on the door, just like on my Ikea ottoman, and a crappy piece of hanging leather meant as a “handle”. Shitty iPad minis attached to racks bought from Autozone. Not only that, but the turn signals replace the running lights!  CRAZY!  Take my millions!!  What a damn joke. Although, kudos to Aston Martin for helping fools part with their money, I guess.
Cheap car: Glossy black plastic One million dollar car: Glossy black plastic with glass infront of it
Umbrella in the trunk?  My how convenient.
I’d have a rolls Royce and a Lamborghini aventador over this anyday
the most bs ad Doug has ever given to us.
Jesus, that interior is depressing. Just an ocean of characterless leather. I feel sorry for the cows that died to make that atrocity happen.
A luxury line for a luxury brand, this is where we are currently at.
I never knew that theres a very expensive version of ford taurus
The Volkswagen Jetta looks better than this
Nope. Even if I had the money, I would never have a car that expensive.
This looks awful. The front looks like a honda accord with those lights
i prefer an S class than this overpriced sh*t
As much I like this car, even for its rareness, I would buy a preowned Rapide which I love , and buy something else  with the $900, 000 ...
This cars tech is garbage. You can get better tech in a $40k car. No excuses.
Who would ever pay this much for this car
I’ll take 2 Phantoms over this over priced Aston Martin Rapide L
Its ugly rapid is more beautiful then this
This thing is ugly as sin.
Whoever bought this car for 1 mil got a very bad deal. I wouldnt expect any car over 40k dollars to have such an outdated interior. I mean yeah the leather is nice but anything that has to do with navigation, buttons, radio, steering wheel is way way way too ugly for a car that costs over 40k let alon in a one million dollar car
Eh....... I don’t see the justification for the MSRP.  Now if Bugatti made a sedan with +1000 HP for over a million then that sedan would be worth it the cost but this... 500hp .... wut.  As for interior - Bentley, Rolls Royce, Ferrari(f12) all have similar high quality interiors.
I'm not impressed. I would still rather own a 18 year old Bentley Arnage
.....24:58....metallic cluncking noise...?
Me:  takes a Phillips head screwdriver to the front license place holder and removes it...   there, now it's a masterpiece!
Literally a trunk piston holding the rear doors open, cheap
LOL this mediocre sedan is worth 120k max.
The front license plate frame completely ruins the entire car.
For a million, what a low effort cash-in for that sweet sweet oil money.
sad that it can't pick you up at your front door:-(  lol!!
dunno what he's talking about, this car is VERY UGLY
I really hate wheels that are brushed face and black painted insert kinda looks like from a cheap chinese atv wheels. Id rather have polished aluminum or gloss silver rims for an expensive car like this.
Doug: the door will stay in the exact place you put it Door: doesn't staying in the exactly place Doug: the door stays in the exactly place you put it aloka
A million dollars and all you get is a bullshit ass umbrella and a little refrigerator... that umbrella better cover the entire car from rain ... FOH.. that car better NEVER get wet or even emotionally sad for 1 million
doug, the car is hideous.
10000000000 dollars I like my crown Vic almost as much
A rolls is much nicer for half the price lol but i guess having a limited number is part of the price
Doug, i know that tastes are subjective and everyone is entitled to their opinion, but you are so terribly wrong about this being beautiful...its horrendous and a clear modern version of the 80's road yacht with the same name...and that was horrific also
Basically you’re paying $1 million for all the animals that died to provide the leather
To be honest, this might have a higher MSRP than the rolls Royce phantom, but if you want to bespoke your phantom, rolls Royce will do just about anything for you making the price significantly higher, depending on what is desired.
This is the best car you´ve never heard about
In intensely beautiful car? Really? It looks like a Kia stinger from the side (minus the awkward rear lights of the stinger) with a Ford Fusion grille
Wait.. no sunroof?
This is probably the worst "recent" car that worth 1 Million...Yes I cannot afford but even if I do I won't even think about it smh
if i was making on average $15 an hour, i would need to work everyday 24 hours nonstop for 8 years  (before taxes) straight to afford this car.
regaling meitneriums
very beautiful car, reminds me of honda insight
I'd rather buy a phantom... If I had the pees...
Doug’s videos have had a lot of “the most _____ “ in them lately. At least this one wasn’t painted by a cactus like that S500 he reviewed.
the best four dour looking car? Are you serious??
You know how popular Doug is when you have a bloody commercial every 2 minutes
Why I'm not impressed? It's not beautiful, it's original but without a badge it might be a KIA concept. It have a mess in buttons, especially park and trunk buttons are hilarious. Driving, if i understood Doug, is nothing special... so?
Amazing.... But  we can buy another car as that money.... This doesnt have big merit...
Love that Car 🔥🔥
Umm them handles to help getting out from the back seat... aluminum finish? magnetic? stainless steel finish could be the thing
2020 bmw 7series way better for half the price
It’s like a Hyundai Genesis from the front
Nothing is special or creative about this thing. Also body style is not fit for this segment.
clearly there is some bias in this video!  I have seen Doug talk cr@p about partially good navigation systems, and this NS has been the shittiest of all and no cr@p was griven! 1M USD for this car is nuts! the only good thing is the interior leather!   I needed to go back and check the beginning of the video to confirm if it was actually 2018 or 2008.
He should have started with “This, will is a depreciation machine”
Look how the door stays where ever you put it! *closes the door too much and it starts to move on its own*
Try and get you hands on a Porsche Singer! DLS if you're super lucky
10th gen Accord front end      Check Lincoln Continental Side          Check Mercedes c63 AMG Coupe Rear end     Check..... perfect  1000000
Looks like a million dollar Dodge Charger. Also the front plate bracket is hideous. Cheers
this review... kinda makes me question all Doug reviews going forward.  So many of his old tastes and judgements of tiny details that he flamed cars with productions magnitudes greater and prices fractions of this but for some reason ignored or looked over here without even so much as a negative tone or comment.  Also "the most beautiful sedan ever made"??? What?  I know its a subjective statement but come on I cant even take an opinion like that seriously, it just looks like a refresh of the 80s Lagonda, not ugly, but by no means the "most beautiful sedan ever made".
This car is undoubtedly cool but for the price I dont think the build quality is acceptable. Bentleys are much nicer.
An overpriced Daewoo‼️😂🤦‍♂️
The Taraf looks like Baraf 🤢🤮
Ridiculous! I’ll stick to my Toyota Century! That’s a real luxury car!
10 😨😨😨 👌👌👍
What I don't get it is how this MILLION DOLLAR sedan only has rear heated seats. When in a Ram 1500 limited that Is 60k has rear heated and cooled seats...IN A PICKUP TRUCK!!!!
I wonder if Aston Martin gives you a clown mask for buying this
Am I the only one who think this car looks ugly for a million dollars?
He probably should’ve disabled comments on this video lol
Rear ended looks like the squished back of a Charger.  Front looks like an Audi
It wasn't most beautiful 4D car with ugly rear door, bad glass design and detailing. It wasn't worth 1 million dollor.
Honda accord front headlights 🤣
This sounds more like a paid ad. I'm almost disappointed, however Doug still deserves our love.
A rolls is much better
Am I the only person who saw the Lamborghini centenario roadster at 0:37??? So pumped for the review of that car!!!
Front end looks like a Honda Accord.
Doug staying in the knee is taller than the car lol
Only middle eastern suckers are going to buy that.
kinda looked like a camaro when i saw it on the title screen
Doug you really dropped the ball on this video, for 1 million dollars you get a car that's under powered, technologically inferior,  haphazardly engineered,  minimally luxurious, and the styling is ok at best. It does not excel at any one category. You make excuse after excuse for all of this cars shortcomings by saying "at the time", dude, 2018 was 2 years ago, not 15. any $200k+ sedan of 2018 beats this car at pretty much everything it tries to do. Don't be a sell out just because a company gives you a free car to drive for a review.
Thats a nice looking Accord you got there
What a horrible looking vehicle
The front looks like a ford focus
Unless they changed the interior it's not the only one in North America. Assuming it's still here there was one with a grey interior sold in Orange County last year: https://www.thedrive.com/news/28057/ultra-rare-and-ultra-sexy-aston-martin-lagonda-taraf-listed-for-sale-in-california
You gotta hand it to Doug, he’s pretty creative when it comes to positioning herself on a level with a car and doesn’t get bothered at all by how strange might look say being on your knees while doing a fucking car review
24:15 something fell off the car and made an audible metallic thunk 😳😬
lesson #1 more expensive doesn’t mean better  lesson #2 dont buy the lagonda
Pretty objective and unbiased review
The lights look like a 10th gen honda accord from the side
Oil money’s car, no surprise it only available in Arabs countries.
Ventilated seats ,.....?
I forgot this existed until I saw it in one of Doug's other videos.
THHHHHIIIIIIIISSSSSSS.......
Doug how are eras counted? Two year increments? Its a 2018 in 2020. I guess I should crush my old clunker from the 2019 era... LOL  a major division of time that is a subdivision of an eon and is itself subdivided into periods. a long and distinct period of history with a particular feature or characteristic. Remember how they made cars in 2019? Was it a golden age?  Lets take a look....... (tomorrows video)
It’s just too much $$ to spend on a car.
I think this car is really nice to look at but no way is this worth even $200k
front looks like a hyundai
$500,000 for nice leather seats & a leather headliner, the rest of the interior is from the A-M and Ford parts bin.  A Rolls or Bentley is a far better value.  Exclusivity should not be prioritized over common sense.
This car is ONLY for those with more money than brains and common sense or sanity for that matter.
Not even worth 100k honestly
Car really doesn't look that good imho.  Must look better .. in person?  Interior looks pretty monotone.  Why not take a better approach and have different colors?  I feel like this car is worth more like $100,000.00, NOT $1,000,000.00.  They just stuck leather everywhere....
Are you sure Taraf doesn't mean asshole
retarded price
Looks like a Volvo
sorry, but i did not see only one damed technical feature that not can be found in nearly every luxury sedan. in fact the most of them you can find in at least in upper midclass  sedans in large numbers. And also the handle with the magnetic hook , so the superrich  owner can manage to move his huge balloon-body out of the seat is really not the innovation the whole car-universe was waiting for. THE ONLY REAL REASON FOR THE EXTRA HIGH PRICE IS; THAT IN THE "DESERT-OIL-STATES" IT SEEMS SO, THAT THEY  HAVE ENOUGH IDIOTS THERE WHO PAY THE  PRICE. (is that carprice a respectless kidding of aston martin to the sons of desert, or will they be unable stop laughing about the cheap try to shock them with the "scary-1-million-price"  hu hu hu  thei´re so scarried about the big number. THATS THE QUESTION )
Wish cameraman would film outside of cars during test drive.
1 million dollars and no power trunk door!?
That thing is ugly, not beautiful.
a mill dollar car with key hole on the door? o.O
Aston Martin only made 120 of them bc they weren’t sure there were more dumbasses than that.
Idc what any of you say I love the styling of this car. That being said, $1MM?
The front design of this car looks more like it came straight from Mazda3... 😕.
paid actor
How is this one of the best looking 4 door cars ever?  A Honda Accord is more appealing than this monstrosity.
So I guess we're not gonna mention the ugly keyhole on the million dollar car as a quark/feature. My Ford fusion even hides it.
It looks like a used bar of soap
Too many excuses for this car. I’d take 2 loaded Phantoms for the price of this thing.
Oh my god doug you spent half of the video just to tell how cool stiches are on seats , well unlike any other car reviews i believe you ran out of word there wasn’t much to discuss other than cool leather seats that cost a 1 million dollars
This is one of the ugliest Aston Martins I’ve seen. It was ugly when they launched it and still is today
Imagine the kind of money you must have to drop $1m of this piece of crap.  Nice car, but that money is stupid.
Everybody is roasting this sedan, but I think its very cool. I dont care about its faults. Every car has them.
$1,000,000 and they couldn't hide the keyhole on the drivers side door?
I'm pretty sure that if you tally up all cars ever made, this will be at the bottom of the list for value...
this is the most sporty "Maybach" ever
that looks like something i would make in automation
$1mil dollars and still looks like a Hyundai Genesis
it kinda looks like a big peugeot508 at the front
Doug goes to London and buys 730 Land Rover T-Shirts.  2 for every day of the year.
It reminds me of the cyber truck
No way. The BMW is better
The most expensive car i never heard of
I get that this is cool for the styling and the rarity, but in my opinion, I’d be really disappointed if I paid one million dollars for this car
My poop is one-of-a-kind but nobody wants it either.
Literally a million dollar luxury sedan! Comfort 10? Doug: Sorry, all I can do is 7
Not worth a million dollars. Gauge cluster extremely outdated for a 2018. Center controlls outdated. Its seems like an aston martin from like 2007 just with stitching and aluminum inside. Why anyone would pay that is beyond me. However you become a fan of a brand, you do anything.
this grill remind me of a Honda new grills, over price car and to many excuses to say this car is this or that, its not
For the money I'd rather have a rolls, Bentley, or Benz with Mansory or Brabus stuff.
Am I the only that thinks that from certain angles this looks like a ford Taurus
For a million dollars I’d want a sunroof, but I guess in United Arab Emirates the last thing you want is the sun beating down on you while driving.
This is the first review you’ve done where I legitimately never heard of or seen the vehicle before. And you have reviewed some pretty vague stuff.
The Mazda 6 looks better than this, with better infotainment, and didn't kill a heard of cows in the process.
Waste of a million
Wow that car looks like it come from 2010. You have to be stupid rich to buy one of these to basically throw away $1M.
I would rather get a new Genesis G90
Lol, is it just me or the front looks like the 2018 Honda Accord 😁
What a shitty color for such a car
Pro tip:  Your channel is huge, but imagine how much more traffic you'd get if you crashed a car like this on purpose during a video
Nice one million dollares Fusion/mazda front
At 24:17 and 25:02 when the car is turning right, there's a loud metal sounding clang sound... what is that?
This car is a JOKE
I don't think this car is even close to being the best looking sedan
I used to respect Aston Martin for its heritage and beautiful cars , but this is such a cheap shot, the Arabian name pisses me off more than the nonsense price tag ,and I think we all know why doug couldn't be realistic about it
10:06 doug lied to us lol
Magnetic aluminum. Revolutionary.
This thing is ugly. Where is a million dollars in luxury? Idiots with more money than sense would buy this. A 10 on styling?🤣🤣🤣 Doug how much did the stealership pay you to pimp this pos? It looks boring af. That interior looks terrible too.
Soon on Hoovies Garage" "thats why i will never buy the cheapest Taraf in the USA"
Very ugly car sorry dog you love Aston Martin so you're biased that's a ugly car I'll take a Honda Accord over it
I absolutely love how it looks. Best proposition for a Sedan. Great grille. Too bad it's a DB9 dash. Should have been a 150000€ (up to 200 000€) sedan to make money to Aston Martin / Lagonda. SUV sure but this would had been logical and immediately accepted.
does anybody else find that the grill looks like literally any genesis??
The government allowed that crap here due to a show and display law? I literally wish I would have never seen or heard about this turd
It better suck and f*** me for a million bucks...
This is the nicest Ford Fusion I've ever seen.
That circle detail is called broughing..
Is it me or it looks like the 2020 Honda Accord
extremely heavy ford taurus energy in the front
Aston Martin V Honda Accord
Cool car but $1 million?? Seems to be more like a $200k car
Looking through the comments make it easy to see that not selling this thing in America was a very good marketing strategy.
As someone who typically loves Aston Martins and the One-77 is my dream car, I do not like the look of this car.
6.0 v12 or 2 ford dura tec V6s glued together
Car and price are a JOKE 😆
Nice car but simply doesn't look like a million dollars compared to alternatives at around half the price. I get that its priced for luxury branding and recognition purposes, not value, but a Rolls has more of those as well.
$1000000?  $700000 profit.
1 million car and it doesn’t even have an automatic trunk ?!? My 2005 Mercedes have it
doug the only guy who uses laganda and ford taurus in the same sentence
Lagonda Taraf sounds Klingon
Still would rather have a E38 750 iL.... or a fleet of them
Beautiful? nawwwww
Wow this has the exact same gauge cluster that's in my 2007 DB9. It's absolutely beautiful except for maybe the old school OLED display, but that feels like quite a rip off.
You buy this car to 💪🏼 on people like Doug said because, honestly, I don’t see how this is worth a million despite being very luxurious on the inside and a nice exterior. I mean hell, they put the umbrella strapped down in the trunk, just to piss the chauffeur off 😂😂
most overhyped car period
FYI : Taraf with “T” in Arabic means wealthy and spoiled
I see you are driving it in Beverly hills which I guess is its natural home.
Front: 2015+ Charger Rear: 2015+ Charger (minus the racetrack lights) Side Gills: Kia Optima Back seats, side profile: Taurus
wdym this era about the side vents it’s 2 years old 😂
Not just the seat belt buckles, they wrapped everything in leather to hide the crappiness
I LOVE the way that Taraf looks! 🤤🤤🤤
THIS...is the type of car nobody would want to buy
Sees the back of the car "I like it"  I see the front  The million dollar R8 rip off  The million dollar R8 rip off  The million dollar R8 rip off  The million dollar R8 rip off  ITS AN AUDI R8 AND IT COSTS 1 MILLION DOLLARS!!!!!!!  BRAAAAAAAAAAAN
While it is beautiful, it’s probably the most overpriced luxury sedan ever made. Love the plastic Ford turn signal, that’s luxury.
1 million dollars!!! Yeah right, I’ve seen kias nicer than this...
Most beautiful sedan ever?  I think Doug has been blinded by dollar signs 🤑
My 2019 bmw 530d is better than this in every single aspect except for the engine, and only costed me 80.000€
I'd give it a 10 in value as it is just that beautiful and just shy of priceless for how exclusive it is.
Is this car the most expensive looking?🤔 I better get Rolls Royce Phantom
I guess spelling ultimate luxury in another language and putting it on a car cost about 600k US dollars.
Who else is here just for the “quirks and features”
its worth about $120k. Give it another5 years and it will be under $100k.
This car looks like KD's foot
Lagonda Taraf sounds like the fake names Rockstar gives the cars in GTA
I quite surprised Doug didn’t roast how many plastics were in this car 😂 He was quite furious where he saw a tiny bit of plastic in a E Class but not this car.
How many times does he say distinctive
This car makes a rolls royce cheap.    I Can't believe a flagship phantom long wheelbase is cheaper than this car. Only thing this car shines on is exterior quality.. Interior's trash.
Back in the 50s my older brother had a chance to buy a LaGonda from a man in Baltimore our father said there was no room in the driveway for it .
This is for a very exclusive market. Whoever bought it won’t lose a penny. Lots of jealousy in the comments.
I really believe this was a crowd funding exercise for Aston. People knew they were not getting 1 million dollars worth of car but they were willing to do it in order to invest in the company. I would be really interested to know how many people who bought these also own shares in the company.
waste of money in my opinion I don't care if I have a billion dollars still wouldn't buy it
Lagonda is to Aston Martin as Maybach is to Mercedes. David Brown (DB) bought the Lagonda company in 1947 in order to acquire their 2.6 litre engines, which were used in Aston Martins during the 50s. The name has since been revived from time to time for special production vehicles. The Rapide name began with Lagonda in the 1930s and was resurrected in 1961 during the DB era as the limited edition Lagonda Rapide, a 4 door version of the Aston DB4
What kind of bottles need to be kept chilled in the middle east? Pomegranate juice?
I normally agree with doug about styling but I just dont see it with this car. It's not ugly but I wouldn't say it's anywhere near the best looking sedan
Maybe I’m too broke to fathom the beauty of this car , but I genuinely don’t see it all . It looks as regular as any car . I wouldn’t even turn my head if I saw this on the streets
Overrated!!!
Lmfao this car is worth no more than 120k
11:02 Doug getting head now huh
Looks like an Aston designed by GTA
every time he moved the door talking about" it stays exactly where you put it" the door moved not by much but it did move and the last time he tried it the door closed and he caught it. Be real Doug......
Am I the only one that’s hyped about the fact Doug is promoting C&B standing behind a Centenario roadster, hoping he’ll review it soon?
Doug... this thing has a torque converter automatic, not a single clutch paddle shift transmission, so the gear changes would be smooth !
I remember when this first came out. Until now, I've never seen anyone review it before. So happy you did. What a machine 😍😍
Doug I will take a BMW M760 that offers everything the Lagonda can't even measure up.  Like does it has its on fragrance or hand jesters to work the infotainment system. Tell me Doug does it have a starlight moonroof or a car pad to control the car. Does it have a key fob that can move the car backwards and forwards out of tight spaces without being inside the car. Even Hyundai Sonata has that. For a million dollars I can by a Mercedes Mayback, BMW M760 and a Bently GT for the price of that car. If one of those Astin Martin pulled up next to me then I would say what a fool. I wouldn't care if one pulled up next to me because I got the best! Doug your problem is the fact that you are attracted to money and not the machine. Like the Bugatti Chiron you reviewed. It doesn't come close in technology vs a 918 Spyder. The Chiron has no modern infotainment system and no touch screen but if it was any other vehicle that doesn't have a million dollar plus tag on it, then I can only imagine what your Doug score would be.  Your views are starting to bore me and you lost your nitch. I'll tune in every now and then but my Doug score for you is a BIG FAT 0 I truly believe you are attracted to the million dollar tag over it's quality
Definitely NOT worth a million dollars. A Rolls Royce is much nicer for half the price.
Looks like a GTA 5 car.
What's up with that giant gray plastic rectangle on the grill?
The leather work looks, well, quite plain. I mean, yes its leather, but they could have done more. I was expecting it to be like diamond stitched...with ACTUAL diamonds for that price.
The "Supreme" of cars
1M and the front looks like a Ford Taurus.
I don't see the Million Dollar price tag justification. But I cannot unsee how quirky Doug's shaving is.
Doug the type of guy to break into your car and talk about the corks and features
How much was he paid to drool over this not that great
Before 7:46 you said like a ford taurus and thats a bad example because that ford still has a ford badge and not something else where as this one has a different name on the manufacturer badge. The rest of the video was good though, i just thought you should know you used a bad example there. A better example would of been the Hyundai genesis because it has a genesis badge rather than a Hyundai badge
get a rolls royce instead
An aston commercial.u getting money from aston otherwise a car geek wouldn't say beautiful about an ugly car
this looks like a full-size mazda sedan, which makes sense given the Ford connection...  Mazda 9
Sorry looks like a Malibu in the back to me.
Rare you say! Saw one in Van Nuys the other day...
I really dont see anything luxurious about it, the steering wheel looks like a 2005 model, and the price is too damn high.  Mercedes-Maybach way better.
I think a Rolls Royce will turn more heads than this Austin Martin. It’s nice, but not 1M nice. It looks and reminds me of the Karma car.
For $1M you get an umbrella just tossed in the trunk, not tastefully hidden in the doors; a manual trunk like a pleb; a $40 Garmin; display graphics from Atari; and exposed key locks in the doors like a ‘74 Chevy.
One million dollar. Really good to know that because Arabian are the most amazing spending human being.
Why do you buy this car? Because you don't know what to do with your money.
That iPads made the car cost up to a million dollars.
People literally paid a million for this. I mean looks like a Mondeo
Id rather get a RR
How much did Aston Martin pay you?
That dashboard is horrible, Has a simillar style to older aston's and no close proximity? And if there is, You still have to take your keys out. To start a million dollar car.. This isn't a versa. If I were to pay for a million I should feel lazy enough to get push-to start... But looks like I can't in the lagonda.. I'd just buy a used 100k-200k Dollar phantom
It looks like I feel when I throw up
The front of the car looks like the new Honda Accord
The front end is like Audi R8, BMW I8, Honda Civic having threesome :D
Not surprised it was marketed for middle east mainly for the sheikh for some them money is just toilet paper.
First time in my life i am absolutely hate car, this is amazing.
Do a Panoz Roadster.
My 370z has windows that wind down slightly when opening 😆 not a feature or qwerk dougy. You are trying to hard to talk about odd things. Capless fuel system? Really? Wtf cares lol keep the videos to 8 min and don't talk aboit shit
Looks like a Rapide but just stretched 5ft longer
1 mil for a Ford on steroids ? Not on my expense
I’m sorry but this just looks like a matte black Taurus. Terrible job Aston Martin smh
you buy this car not for its practicality, technology, etc. This is for the very rich people that likes to spend their money on Ultra rare cars like this one.
Eeh I think the Aston Martin Rapide looks better than this but who am I to judge... im just a peasant....
Are you gonna review the Centenario before it sells since you’re standing next to it?
Lol they forgot to change the engine cover name
29 minutes for a car review ?
Thumbnail had me thinking this was a Dodge Challenger Sedan
I don't care about anything else when a car looks this good
That front license plate mount is horrible too
2 Ford V6's tied together and great stitching for 1mill...hmmmm
Clearly Doug Sold His Soul! How embarrassing!
It looks like a decked out Ford Fusion
Looks like an infinity
Those vents looks like taken from na old volvo... This car is soo overpriced
Front is definitely charger/accord
Sad front grill looks like Hyundai genesis
that steering wheel is a travesty, considering the price of this car. big plastic buttons jutting out like horse's teeth. cmon Aston.
I can’t imagine the smell of the leather 😍🔥
Ast-ON  arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh never unheard !
Ngl an S class is wayyyyy nicer, Aston martins are so bland inside
No one :- how is this most luxurious sedan ever?  Doug :- Look how they they got glass instead of plastic in between two windows!!!
"Best looking car ever" bro chill that bih ugly
If you take it to carmax to sell it,they would give you 100k for it n sell it for 8xs more.
Ok, but for a million dollars, was it purposely made to look like it was painted with Rust-Oleum semi gloss black?
Nope. Not for me.
Kinda looks like a Dodge Challenger at the back. Such expensive cars really sound like a scam to me.
North America includes Canada and Mexico 🇲🇽 in Mexico there's one, belongs to Don Huayra.
that ceiling-curving-up for better headroom "luxury feature" also appeared on the..........1st generation Dodge Durango.
Pretty reasonable Doug scoring in my opinion.
Anyway good review ✌🏼❤️
Let's just say Aston wasn't reinventing the wheel for this overpriced car.
Laganda is not Arabic word , i’m from KSA and I never heard of Laganda  before 😊
im mind boggled you think this is the prettiest 4 door car,  it think its so bland. but where all entitled to our opinions i guess
Aston Martin made an Accord. Great.
It's ugly. Looks like a genesis
Since cars and bids sponsored doug .. he forgot about cnc motors 💔😢
It's hideous.  Maybe the only thing uglier is the original Aston Martin Lagonda from the 70's.  The good thing is that it's an Aston so it will be available for $30K soon.
With a million dollars, I'd buy a phantom, a flying spur and an S class.
Lagonda sounds like Honda because this thing looks exactly like a Honda Accord.
Amount of ads on this video is insane!!!!!
You could buy 7 fully loaded 7 series with much more features and better numbers everywhere for the same price.
I think this was a sarcastic review.
Did he say that Lagonda is Aston Martin's LUXURY brand? So Aston Martin itself is for peasants? 🤔
Can anyone say money laundering?
no sunroof?
Saw this amazing AM Lagonda 2 year ago at Cars&Copters Huntington Beach.  Truly impressive  design.
I didn't know it existed but it honestly looks like ford Taurus or Fusion . It has this weird ford look to it
If there's any car worth 1 Million Bucks... This one surely ain't it...
Disappointed.. a clearly sponsored video and Doug dare not criticize the ancient gauge cluster, dashboard, and stupid gas door button. Way over priced, looks like a Hyundai Genesis. Same with the Stinger review. Lost all credibility Doug! I don’t event think the potential future owner of this $1m vehicle will be watching YouTube 😂
so practical score is 5 same as an s class maybach dude this car is terrible how practicality is compared to an s class , the s class is the most sucsesful luxury sedan ever .
HA!   Just realized you're on Petersen's roof.  Dude I miss cars and coffe in Petersen's garage so bad.  Truly one of the best places in the entire country for car enthusiasts.  Cannot wait till we have a real vaccine so that the world can get back to normal life again.
This car is such a piece, like it doesn’t even have cooled seats or a sunroof or an infotainment system.  Why’s he not roasting it 😂
Oil sheikh mobile. Tasteless and not worth the dime.
This is literally a Ford Taurus with some nice upholstery. Just look at the front end, it looks exactly like a Taurus. Even Doug snuck in a Taurus reference at 7:44
this car definitely belong in a car collector garage. it's kind of ridiculous that you spent 1 mil on a car that has ford focus turn signal stocks, and a garmin navsystem..
did he ever say when it was made?
THIS CAR IS PERFECTLY DESIGNED AND PRICED FOR WHERE IT IS BEING MARKETED TO.
its very ugly
This car was made for Middle East suckers
The front looks just like the 2018+ accord
I dont see a million worth of car. Especially when they use parts directly from a Ford parts bin that Ford doesn't even use anymore.
...your running out of things to talk about when you keep going on about the stitching and leather and the logos.
Your kia stinger is better then this lagonda
It's what the Rapide should have been.
This car is so ugly. That matte black paint and those cheap aftermarket looking wheels are just 🤮
And so the Rolls Royce Phantom is still better
LMAO looks like a upscale Ford Mondeo
Aston Martin is a British super car, this looks like an Americanised Alfa Romeo on steroids, horrible horrible horrible
Genesis' design originates from this car.
This shouldn’t exist
For a million dollar: No self charging tablets No variable back vents FORD FOCUS TURNSIGNAL wtf? Small navigation No power only 530 hp Unfuntional and ugly steering wheel Ugly climate control No panorama or star heaven like rr Tachometer looks like from 2005 Its not an ugly car but it has nothing that explains why its  wortj fucking 1 mio
clearly the speedometer says KM/H and at the top theres a MPH too..
This car is not that attractive. I'd say the last gen s8 and m5 kick its butt in looks and probably performance, reliability, etc.
I’d rather get a 2020 Bentley continental gtc or a Rolls Royce wraith
Stunning perfection
7:02 they embosed up mark so we can figure out its orientation.
Looks more like that togg Turkish car that will come out this/ next year
doug must have been given 10,000 or more to review this with that scoring
My dream car but in the worst color unfortunately
25:00 CLANG! Was that the car or Doug's reputation going down the pan?
The DBS Superleggera and the and the DB11 are more beautiful. MOST beautiful is the Valkryie.  Change my mind.
19:04 saying speedometer is in kilometers even there is a miles per hour measurement just little inner in circle...
C4!!!!
"specific market demand" . idiocy
Even the name is crap
Image a AM Repeat, I mean Rapide, I mean Lagona Taraf, went to Japan. Slept with an old Honda Accord. Many years later a Mazda knock on the door saying Hi Dad. And you are not so sure if that’s your child
Wow!  So beautiful!  Very middle eastern looking...or styled...or whatever.  Fitting since it was designed for that part of the world.
a m760li has more luxury then that
When you spend a million dollars and the trunk is “soft touch” instead of fully automatic...!!
Front fender indicators look just like a Holden Caprice..
I got the same hydraulics on my screen door in my shed
This is not Ford Fusion?
Wow so many haters in the comments section. This car is utterly beautiful and doug is right is it one of the most beautiful Sedans ever made. But i will knock that there are some crappy parts in the car thats over a Million dollars. Come on Garmin nav and no different switches for it thats just lazy on Aston Martins Part. That is prolly why it was never sold here cause i am sure every Rich american that could buy this car would pass on it for those facts alone. But if i ever had enough money to own one i would buy it cause its so pretty.
$1m and Kia Optima SX wheels
i appreciate your honesty at least when you gave it a score
It has a warning label that says: Avoid Portland and Seattle with this vehicle
“from this era” and “at the time” are peculiar ways of saying “two years ago.” I feel like you made too many excuses for this car.
If this thing gets more than a 3 on styling i'll be disappointed. Hideous thing.
So that's what a long wheelbase Ford Fusion looks like.
I'd rather have a Toyota Century with the *_M  A  J  E  S  T  I  C      C  H  I  C  K  E  N  !  !  !_* 🐔🐔🐔
Looks like a Ford Fusion from the front 😂
how can you climb in that interior with those dirty knees ?:))
I think it looks like a newer Honda Accord and a Ford Taurus combined and then got stretched
Artificially expensive car
Doug gushing over how beautiful a car that looks like a nice Volvo was simply ridiculous. I think he can't look past the price tag, "it cost a million dollars, it simply HAS to be gorgeous."
I'd still prefer a Lexus. The only reason I would buy this over, say, ANYTHING ELSE reasonably priced would be the looks. I can agree this car looks awesome.
I thought Doug was being sarcastic when he was praising the styling. LoL. This car is boring as hell outside and inside. Just my opinion though.
Hyundai Genesis lagonda ?
100k $ , that's the max i would pay for this car and even that just for the brand's sake
Um Doug... that was just a souped up rebranded 2020 Honda Accord. 😆
No panoramic window; No decent media system; No decent navigation system; No auto pilot or drive assistance; No hybrid super powers under the hood; No climate controls in the seats; Did he mention the massage function? nope!; A finish that looks like cheap vinyl wrap; An ashtray that looks like a jug; A fridge in the back that potentially could damage your stuff, the way it's finished; All plastic levers and buttons; Outdated gauges and unfinished climate controlls; Huge ugly B pillars; Right in sight child seat anchors and really handmade pouches for the safety buckles, nice! (not); To me it looked like pretty poor stitching (or lack of stitching) at the ceiling; Cheap aftermarket bracket mounts for iPads (iPads are ok though); Why do you have to put that brick (aka key) into the start button? Design is completely boring... Who is buying a sedan anyway? What did he take?!
kinda looks like bmw i8
Sorry Doug, this isn’t worth a million bucks, they could have at least leather wrapped some of the dials. Yes it’s nice, I’ll take a Rolls any day. For now I will keep driving my 2020 Sonata.
Breathtaking beauty, Doug?  Looks like an Accord🙄
I came here for the comments.
That a weird looking Mitsubishi one
I was not impressed with this car. Doug talked about beautiful styling but my dad’s 2011 Chevy Malibu looks just as sporty as this car. Doug does not evaluate very expensive cars the same as he does regular cars. If you watch his reviews on cars like Audi or BMW he finds many negatives, but when those same negatives are not an issue with the more expensive vehicles. I realize that he has to do it in order to be invited to view the expensive cars. But if he thinks his reviews are unbiased that is completely illogical. He is a good guy so I’m not trashing him. Only that he is not consistent with his reviews of cars. In his mind, the higher the value, the better review it gets.
Since I’m an Arabic speaker, there is no such thing as Taraf in Arabic. There is Torath and it actually means something antique and historical. It doesn’t have to do with anything luxurious tbh, but I just wanted to point that out for the people who are interested in the name. Like it so Doug can see it :)
This car just isn’t worth 1,000,000
I wish Toyota would buy Aston Martin.. it would give them and Lexus an additional injection of “passion” plus come up with a plan to make Aston profitable and development new models to compete against Rolls & Bentley.
Damn doesnt have rear ventilated seats for 1M, id kill myself sitting in the back knowing that i could have 2 LWB phantoms for the price of ford taraf
This car is trash...
The thing is , something is worth what people are willing to pay for it .... So if people bought these cars , yes they are worth 1 million... It's kind of how the world works in general 😂
Looks like a DB9, SLR, Quattroporte, Challenger (front to back) long version!?!  Where is the beauty you are talking about? And why is it not quiet in the car?
No, Doug... a $1M price tag + super low quantity numbers ABSOLUTELY DICTATES and MANDATES a bespoke experience.  I don’t want anything shared. No Walmart Garmin GPS units.  No exposed hydraulics.  If there are stalks, they should be made of wood from the Ark.  Noah... Covenant... pick one.
And I know looks are subjective but it looks like a goddamn ford
Hmmmm...wonder if Jay Leno has one of these tucked away in his garage somewhere?!?!?
Worth no more than 200k new
doesnt worth one million u could buy better thing for that money
Am I the only one who didn't know this car existed until Doug?
looks like a new honda accord
Aston Martin having been resurrected a few times but hey...let's have a extra brand
The front is a Honda Accord. 😴
Ofcourse Doug is a paid actor here from AM. In all honesty, this car should not be worth more than $50k. It's no head turner or one of the best looking sedans at all.
😂😂😂
I don't think it's that beautiful.. Nissan GTR door handles. Soft touch close trunk, lol late 80s Town cars already had that..
Make 120... you can charge $1M for exclusivity. Well... why don't they make 2, and charge $100 million? 🤣😁🤣😁  Anyway, nice looking Ford Fusion you got there.
Can i buy car in carsandbids from Malaysia and drive it in Malaysia?
I’m always disappointed in the videos where Doug doesn’t floor it. Lol
It looks like 2020 Honda Accord
And THIS is a Ford Fusion Lagonda..
Doug the type of guy to put money in a vending machine even though it's empty
Eh. I'll save my 1 million and just buy 2000 old Ford Rangers
Clearly got paid for calling this the (Most beautiful) etc. This car isn't ugly, but it is boring in appearance.
Looks like something I’d own in GTA, and the price don’t lie either.
Looks like a honda accord front end
3:55 dougs actual height next to this behemoth.
"what is a lagonda?" sounds like some species of eel
VOM=fail
Aston Martin : "Hey.. we have an Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf with cost US $ 1 million. Look at the interior, leather everywhere"   Rolls Royce : "Well.. hmm.. hold my shooting star roof".
you know aston martin were high when they decided to built a luxury car more expensive than a rolce royce ...and u know ...they failed in the luxury
Hahaha this car is such a joke, for a million dollars what a disgrace. The only thing I found different and unique is the key / ignition.
Whattttt Lagonda came out in 2018?!!! Why the hell did I not heard about it 2 years ago?!?!?!?!?!
Absolutely NOT worth a million dollars
I was expecting Doug to absolutely roast this grossly overpriced turd just like he roasted the Maserati Ghibli.  But all he did was pander to the folks who paid him to glorify this monstrosity.
Someone Make a counter for "lagonda" , losing my mind...
Good god Doug. My 2003 Bonneville has better lines than this car.
Soon as I get my Stimulus !!
Shittiest sedan i have ever seen for a million dollar!!! It's no where near s class or 7 series ,rolls Royce and Bentley are in another world to compare with this shit
Watch it getting ruined with a 5% tint a weeks after sale...
This car was slapped together from spare parts; and sold to people who love to waste money.
Being that the car was imported for show and display it is subject to very limited mileage use restrictions.
Wow! Congrats on the Galant's facelift, Mitsubishi.
12:49 fun fact, Aston Martin designed the button to look like an artic beast
Aston Martin should stop this overpriced Lagonda crap line.
So you are saying people paid 900’000K too much for a car. Got it
It looks like a dodge challenger and honda accord
Why did they just round off the corners of the the 80s Lagonda?  It’s only slightly less ugly.
Phantom looks better, wealthiest and it’s way cheaper
the only million dollar car to turn 0 heads
I think the word he was looking for was, "exquisite" to describe this car. What a car!
Aston Martin is charging at least 3 times what that car is actually worth.
It's not that honest review we were waiting for especially from a million dollar aston that a well equipped s class is way more beautiful and luxury..
Why does Doug look in fast motion and super wui
For me this cars isnt beautiful look like a ford fusion well equiped
Cars go vroom Like if I’m right
Doug: you can open the door no matter how far and place it precisely where you want. Door: wants to fall back and close like every other car
Weird looking Honda accord 🤔
The front looks like an accord
A larger version of the Rapides large grill;nice touch.
This is a terrible car for the price wtf. No cooled seats in back? No massage in back? Shitty back controls with cheap plastic? Man I don't even feel sorry for the people getting ripped off, if you buy this, you're an idiot.
THE FRONT END LOOKS LIKE AN ACCORD!
Up until this video I thought Doug wasn't ever biased, or maybe only a little bit, but this... I can't believe he truly thinks what he is saying
This front grill What a wonder !
Doug’s the type of guy to let his kid pick out his kaki shorts and overdried T to preview million dollar car
This will be the most depreciated car ever.
Shits a million dollar Ford Taurus
Please Doug, tell us you were being sarcastic.
Mercedes S Class looks better than this
1 million and no sunroof.
Doug the type to open a car door on his knees
Looks like a Fusion.
for a million dollars this is worthy of called a piece of crap.. Only redeemable thing is the truly very nice design
Front end ripped off a Mazda 3
Doug calling this car beautiful = paid advertisement
The Alfa Disco Volante is beautiful car. This looks like hot garbage
Remember when Harman Kardon were the "It" car speakers. Pepperidge Farm remembers.
in my opinion Kia K900 looks better and is much more luxuryus.I think you were confused from the price tag because it looks like a ordinary sedan without a rear bumper. wrapping the seat belt buckles whit leather is a 5 dollar job, and it looks terrible.  the use of unnecessary skin is ridiculous, as if someone said "hey, we have increased leather in our hands, what to do?" and they said "so let's cover everywhere"
it looks like an Aston Martin parody you'd find in GTA V
Next Week on Hoovie’s Garage: I bought the cheapest Lagonda Taraf in all of North America.
the most biased review after the new jeep wrangler lol
Ah yes, an umbrella, right what everyone needs in Dubai. Great attention to detail, Aston Martin.
A million dollar car that is made from cheap plastic
Taraf mean luxury in arabic, Aston Martin own by Kuwaiti bossiness men
Lol an S class interior destroys this car. Nice car, but not for the money at all. I don't see 1 million dollars anywhere on this car. I love you Doug, but you cannot compare this to any limited edition Ferrari.......
The door designers were like... Let’s Copy Mclaren...But let’s not make it obvious
Ok some of the peeps down here gotta chill out. Styling is highly subjective. It's the Doug Score not a scientifically peer reviewed tier list
doesn't Ford make Aston Martin now? Those wheels look like they're from a 15-17 premium mustang with the 20 inch wheel package. I've seen other Aston Martin's with S550 looking headlights also.
Doug reviews the "most expensive luxury sedan" and he didn't even comb his hair! Sheesh! He's trying really hard to make this car look good!
That rapide that went for ~45K on carsandbids is looking even better after this video.
You should do the review of the Volkswagen type two W. Phalia Camp mobile
“Tarath means ultimate luxury in Arabic.” No doug, just no. This is so wrong. Tarath is tradition or heritage.
Nice accord
Doug, you may have noticed the speedometer's km/h on the outside, and mph on the inside.  That's how Canadian-spec vehicles often have it.
HEY DOUG you wanna drive a Divo? https://youtu.be/eEOmRq14D7Q Your viewers have already done the hard work for you 👌🤣
Given the price point, AM-L could have replaced the plastic Ford stalks with aluminum or carbon fiber ones, even if the internals were the same. Also, at this price point, Doug could have worn something nicer than cargo shorts and 2 T-shirts.
A Million for that?!! is this a joke? It is NO WHERE as luxurious or prestigious as a Phantom, and the RR costs almost half of that!
Not impressed at all
9:00 am
Gotta be one of the ugliest as well
I guess price cant always buy good taste. And still looks to be true.
Most beautiful sedan ever made...? Really...?
Way overpriced,  nothing jaw dropping about it. Alot of cars under 100k that look better and more reliable.
The rear end looks like a Dodge Charger five years from now.
It’s overrated and overpriced...Austin Martin thought they did something here but they don lagonda missed.
James Bond would looooove this car!!!
It looks like a model of a Lincoln Continental for an early PS2 game.
Who else freaked out when they saw the Centenario
Comically long Ford Fusion.
Definitely does not look like its worth a million. I'd take 2 phantoms instead, thank you.
Looks like a nice Acura. The BMW E38 is still a better looking sedan.
@20:36 Shame... .. should've been called the Ashtray Martin.
wow I truly adore Aston Martins and even older Lagonda models but this is just awful, it really shows which market it is made for, people who only buy a car for its price tag and rarity
Stopped watching when doug said the stalks came directly from a focus. 😕 I'd take a fully optioned phantom and a cullinan for a mil and never see a short changed piece
Wow Doug you need to up your expectations for $1MM.  Leather interior roof with 5 inch screen wow!
The coolest thing about this car is the paint. Definitely not a million dollar car,  especially the interior
You just know daddy Doug is getting commission when this sells🤣
Just offering a new market: Cars & Bids The Netherlands...
Hahah no way didn’t even know what it was but I saw one a couple days ago outiside work, a couple of ladies from Kuwait owned it. Crazy.
1 million dollar 2020 honda accord hhahahaah this car is stupid
LOOKS LIKE A STRETCHED i8
Let's start a GoFundMe to get Doug some glasses. I am a little worried about this review. This thing is hideous
Uh.... I guess you’re paying a million dollars for “flex value” because I can think of a million other things to spend a million dollars on... jeez Aston Martin... they new Americans wouldn’t pay for this because the interior is 100k luxury at best... Americans would scoff at this interior... not worth the money.... also it will depreciate terribly as soon as you drive it off the lot...
It looks like the car Lamar from GTA V would drive after he guilts Franklin into giving him some of the heist money.
Lagonda Doug score Hold my grain of salt.
I love how Doug always puts the next car he’s reviewing in the promo bit for the car website
That circle and dots pattern is a reference to the broguing on men's shoes, I'm assuming to allude to the classic British shoe manufacturers.
„Dingle around“ dingle i learned a new word
The front end looks like the current gen Honda Accord
1/120 million dollar hand-built car with seven layer paint and gloss finish some dude: I'ma wrap it matte black      y
The taillights remind me of a camaro
Doug has a bias for Aston Martin.  This car has the same wheels as my 2017 Ford Explorer Sport.    Doug: PLEASE REVIEW RS6 AVANT!!
There's plain and then there is plain ugly.  This is a whole lotta boring bold, simple designs mashed together.  Looks like a longer, smoothed out version of a  Dodge Charger with the same boring shape...along with a reshaped Chrysler 200 rear end.  Calipers look aftermarket painted and wheels look clumbsy/aftermarket cheap AF.  How is this remotely attractive looking?  Damn, I sure do question Doug's judgement on vehicle aesthetics now.  Wow...this is a no-brainer fugly with a BIG F.  👎
This car actually annoyes me on how much its coasts and what u get
I’ve finally found it... after years of searching... my least favorite car:)
My God i can only imagine the nightmare it will be to try to find parts for this car, let alone find someone who can fix it.
"The door stays exactly there" as the door moves to close itself twice but Doug catches it with his other hand. Sure, Doug...Did he get paid for this review?
U forgot the ugly key hole on driver's side door 🙄
Basically a long wheel base rapide, not hating just sad to see aston martin to half ass a million dollar car (Compared to Bentley"s million dollar coupe)
Looks like a GTA vehicle
Peugeot 508 looks much better. This is ugly and such an outdated. It would be ok in 2007, but now? And how about iPad holders?? :D omg!!! U can even charge them?! What a luxury...
This is paid is it not? O'Gara or whatever tryna get their hands off of this thing
Doesnt even have cooled back seats... what a luxury car...
He keeps saying “this era” of Aston Martin. What year is this car?
1 mill and they couldn’t put some tint on there
This ain’t a million dollar car
Crazy that the only impressing he can talk about is the details on the seats 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐: ( Me tryna see the "Breathtaking Beauty" Doug's talkin about)🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Centenario!!!!!!
What is so funny about the comments hating this car is 99% of you will never even see one of these let alone drive one.  This car was specifically made for the very richest people on earth - they don't give a shit what you think.
Looks like a 2019 Honda Accord in the front and Camaro/ Charger in the back😭
19:12 AMERICANS: And that may make you wonder what exactly is this kilometer
There’s something to be said for the economy of scale in mass production.
A million dollar just on branding??? These guys at Aston Martin know how to rip you off. I might understand it’s exclusive but, Tell me how Is this better than a Phantom with customized treats? It’s just a Rapide with fancy leather ceiling.
Gawked at the price tag; just from first appearance I would never ever guess that vehicle costs a million. From the features I would still consider it a luxury vehicle sure, but for less than a quarter of the price.
Like Ted Danson
Looks like the current gen Honda Accord from the headlights and grille.
Its overpriced. But the sheiks and pinces of the middle east won’t mind
Very good content but to much advertisment.
It’d be ridiculous to see the profit that they made on these. A rapide in a new skin basically with an $800k mark up. 😂🤯
🤮🤮🤮🤮
If Doug ever called to my door in times of need I'd have to throw money at him and tell him to buy some fucking pants!
Is it me or does the grille look like a Mazda?
plz make a 240z review
I really like this car
Looks wise, I would happily take an Audi Q6 or Q8 over this in a heartbeat. Or an E92 M3 sedan. I actually might even like the look of my 2017 Accord Sport over this. I don't get why it's regarded as so beautiful, just not my style I guess.
Is it me or does this “$1,000,000” car have halogen headlights?? And no sunroof???
7:12 the front end kinda looks like the new accords...
This car makes the Rapide even a greater deal than it already is!
My dad bought one of these but sold it very quickly as the cup holder was too small for his favourite thermos flask. He likes to take soup with him when he drives so it was an absolute deal breaker. When he went to test drive it, I told him to take his flask to make sure it fitted but he assured me it would be ok. It wasn't.
Not worth $100,000 in my opinion. Looks like a Toyota 👎
This looks like a car I’d find in watch dogs
So this is a complement to the US. Aston Martin didn’t think we were stupid enough to buy this?
is this some kind of a joke or what? ? My Volvo XC60 is better than this crap 60
The radio and climate control interface looks very similar to the old Volvo system from like 2010. Paired with the garmin nav and this cars center stack tech looks like it was ripped from a 2010 XC90.
Doug: This is the most beautiful 4-door car I have ever seen!  Me, before clicking the video after just seeing the thumbnail: fuck, that thing is ugly
I’d just get a used Rapide for $80k.🤷‍♂️ #wayoverpriced
Wow. An Audi A8 is a thousand times more luxurious than this shitbox for 1/10 of the price.
The styling is pretty lame.. not too sure how Doug thinks it's soooo beautiful..  This shit has a key hole in the door, ffs 😂
interior looks like a baseball glove, not exactly beautiful lol
Anyone else think this thing is kinda ugly? The grill looks like that of a Hyundai
And for $900k less the lexus lc500 has a better interior ... hell even the porsche taycan or an s class would be better
Wow. What a gorgeous car. Very unique. The angled C-pillar is really cool, too...great throwback to the old Lagonda.  And, I don't think I've ever seen a car's front end so thoroughly wrecked by a front plate mount. All I could look at was that giant thing and its stupid up arrow...
Doug is taller than the car standing on his knees...
I wonder how the ventilated seats work without perforated leather... 🤔
A million for a sedan and that’s what they offer? A joke I tell you
Imagine having so much money they you can buy this piece of shit and not have any second thoughts. Must be nice.
Best looking car ever? Have you even seen the smoky and the bandit trans am?
Is Doug being sarcastic...
LaFerrari Aperta
That is a beautiful car.
From the comments you can understand why they didn't sell it in North America
A mulsanne looks a million times better
But does it means you can DRive it or can only be imported if you use the car on shows to display?
I give a slow clap to whoever buys this bland chunk of car
For a million dollars, those rear seats need to be heated AND COOLED.
Most Expensive and one of the most unreliable car brands
This is so ugly. The front looks like Sonata and a bunch of other cheap sedans.
This is really a queston about gas door release buttons/levers. Why does one need to touch their toes to release the door? Why isn't the button/lever on the dash or console? For a million bucks it needs to be more accessible.
Idk why but front looks like baby of Honda Accord and Ford Fusion.
If I could afford this, I would get a Phantom, a few motorcycles, a Tahoe for winter and a new house instead
Front looks like a Honda Accord
The round knobby thing at the top of the leather handle is for your covid mask to hang. Now THATS attention to detail.
$1 million dollars and you still get a doorman big ugly silver key hole front and center. That’s ridiculous. $15,000 cars even hide those nowadays...cmon. Overpriced and overhyped.
Thanks for the review Doug
Aston Martin: "In keeping with the stately appearance of this vehicle, the seats have a special brogue embroidery."  Doug: "If you look at the seats you'll see this neat circle pattern."
Just not as interested in these unattainable car videos.
Doug, gotta be honest here- you're paying 1 million dollars for a car made from old bits from the Ford parts bin, wrapped in fancy leather stitching.
I'm gonna get shot for this, but the front kind of looks like a Ford Fusion
The styling is unremarkable. This is a limited edition phaeton.
Am I the only one that thinks that it kind of looks like a Honda Accord from the front ?
Darmok and Jalad at Lagonda Taraf!
Rims look like genesis g70 rims lol
Challenger from side and Accord from front. 🤯😹
Is it just me or does this car NOT look beautiful at all?
What a piece of garbage. Lmao.
Not for a Milli 🧐
Doug over gassing up this car like its the most beautiful thing ever, are we looking at the same car? This thing is boring 😴
1mil ? .. this is a disaster lol ..
Beautiful car. However, the paint... Not sure if a luxury sedan/ limousine should have a matte paint
What year is this car?
they paid him for this video, and they paid him well. doug has really oversold this car
How is that shit worth 2 Phantoms?
they only made 120, each at about 1 million, assuming they made a profit, they brought in 120 million, minus materials costs, they can't have spent more than 100 mill developing them, like 1/10th of a lexus ls400 lol
newest  Mercedes A series or Mustang ?
What makes this 1 million dollars?
Should have recorded this review on April 1st.
Looks like fusion morphed with a Honda Accord
9:50 The ability to hold or "check" the door in any position is not provided by the gas-assist strut that you point out. Multimatic Inc. (Cdn) developed the "infinite checker" quite some years ago. It's available on several higher end OEM platforms.     The "curb-rise" geometry on these doors is (beautifully) exaggerated to the point of "Swan-wing" doors. In order to make the door "weightless" to the operator throughout the lift swing, the gas-assist strut is added. The porting in the strut will be tuned specifically to that panel such that opening and closing it take the same effort.
Ford indicator stork? Really now. 1 million dollars for that. An interior from a previous model. I would strip that car down and built me a man cave with that interior instead. Giv me a RR  or BMw 760 or A S class or a maybach instead. Thats a Cheap car. With a ludicris price.
Not sure if I'm wrong but those "swan hinge" doors seem uneven... The passenger side seems lower...
One of the most ugliest sedan in history... 1 million? There is a sucker born every minute.
The interior does NOT look worth $1mil just an opinion :/
What is that weird plastic looking thing in the grill? What's up with it's Up arrow? I would have guessed that would be a Quirk we would be told about.
The exterior reminds me of a Lamborghini Estoque but way uglier
Never disagreed more with Doug. Hugely overpriced for what just isn’t that good or beautiful
Actually there’s two in North America. The one you showed in this video and a grey one in Mexico City.  The owner goes by the nickname of Don Koenigsegg
It's from the year 2015.
I'd rather have the S65 AMG
The interior color is premium
This isn't a most beautiful 4 door car, and this isn't a beautiful car whatsoever.  Looks like a Volga Lada and Niva soviet Hybrid(not an electric meaning).  Google "Копеика без бампера" look what comes out, that what this AM is!  Its just limited addition! If you make 5 million Bugatti it will cost under 100k,
Doug, the 90s called, they want their yahoo-mail back.
Come on Doug don’t change your ways
I’d pick a Rolls Royce any day over this...I think even a ghost is nicer than this inside lol
A million dollar car? I don't know chief, this ain't it for me.
No offense but the grill just screams Mazda lool.
Is overpriced
If i`d have to choose between this Taraf and a fully loaded Skoda Superb, i`d pick the Skoda anytime.
Who in their right mind would skip not one but TWO Phantoms for this overpriced Ford?
Aston's marketing dept deserves a round of applause for pulling this off. Basically they've found a bunch of absurdly rich fools in the third world who were ready to pay 2x RR Phantom for a streched Rapide with concept car styling.
It looks like Opel insignia in black matt 😝
I bet if you tick every box on the Panamera or Taycan option list, you can top this by several billion dollars.
Why does it look like a new Honda Accord... or is it just me
Unpopular opinion: this car deserves a 10 for styling, it’s beautiful
I agree, for a million bucks this is crap.   Might as well build a long wheel Pinto, wrap it in leather and tech, and price it a 2 Million dollars. Then it will be "rare".
The most beautiful 4 door car ever? Please, Doug...you're exaggerating sooooo much!
Someone should buy that and use it to be an Uber driver.
arabic king: ill take all 100
So wheres the luxury?
No matter how beautiful this car is, it just isn’t worth 5 Maybach S550
y’all are gonna try and call me out as a liar but ive actually seen one in america. it was in huntington beach
Million bucks and no ventilated seats in the back
Looks like a Volvo
Back looks tiny. Doug sold out on this one for sure
Way too much Ford Taurus influence on the front for a perfect ten in styling.
Take a shot everytime he says "lagonda" and "Not Aston Martin"
I found myself insulted when he said its most beautiful 4 door sedan...what the hell..more beautiful than e38? not even close, all proportions are off
For a million dollars the least they could have done is not go with that Ford Fusion front end...
I need a poster for my wall I know I'll never own one but my dreams are just as if I were ae to own it in my heart peace
I kinda want it...
Doug is the type of guy to rag on the Q50 for having a “boring back seat” but gush over car that is ridiculously mediocre for the price tag. No more interesting than a Hyundai Genesis. I would think this was a $45k car if it drove by.
a million dollar piece of crap
I didn’t know what the hell the model name means, until Doug said it’s ultimate luxury in Arabic. So once and for all, it’s pronounced Taraf. Not Taraaaf.
Built for the Middle East that's why it's a million dollars...
The title was very exciting....after watching the video, overwhelming disappointed...
This is one weird looking hyundai sonata
Idk man, I could buy a house in LA with that car.
This car's exterior reminds me of the ford fusion, and the interior looks like something from 2007. Both not something you want to be associating with a million dollar car.
Plot twist: he was roasting the car the whole Vedio 🔥🤣
Looks like a Ford Fusion from the front 😂
Is no one going to note how Doug was right next to a Centenario in the Cars and Bid promotion.
A Phantom looks and seems so much more luxurious. And for $400k less! I'd take a Phantom and throw in a little more to get a Ghost to go with it instead..
Seems like only yesterday when the original door stop inspired styling Lagonda hit the market.
All infotainment systems are out of date by definition
Beautiful car but it isn't even close to million dollars car
A car made for the middle east with a champagne fridge?
Interesting. Who would pay 1 Million for a car That can’t do anything a phantom can
This the same dude that trashed Aston Martin for having ford parts right???? 500 hp form a v12??? am I in the matrix?
16:53 you hav Anston Martin text on Nav system 🤯
a moment of silence for those that bought it.
Nice streched ford mondeo/fusion
This just shows how bad the brand is doing when they release an extended rapide and charge a mil for it.
It’s like a grown up Maserati
Nice car but definitely not a million dollar car! The so called luxury car market of cars are way overpriced and overrated! The only cars that are worth a million dollars are hyper cars!
The only reason this car cost $1 million dollars is because some rich Saudi would pay that much for it. A same year Bentley has a much nicer interior and exterior design.
I wonder if the owner got a discount for leaving the car in primer
Anything I can't afford is not my cup of tea
at 10:00 says you can place the door precisely where you want, and it will stay exactly there... at 10:03 door does not stay exactly there
This car will never get sold
It is hard to believe that in 2018 that was what they had for a navigation system  entertainment system. My 2013 rav4 was only 26000 and the  Infotainment system is better. 2018 wasn't that long ago. The font that is used looks like something that was 10 or 15 years ago.  But it does have nice lines.
the screen in the front of the car looks like a screen form a kia in 2016
crap colour
I’m arab and I don’t know who will buy this garbage
Ok, I didn’t know about this car.  Now I NEED one. Just stunning. I don’t mind if it’s clearly not worth the cost, if the features are not so exclusive, I just really love the design.
Rumour has it,that all the Sheiks pooled a fund together and put a hit on Doug for insulting their cars.$.58cents isn't much,but they 'couldn't give a camel's phart what he said'.
"that's all they had at the time" is not the excuse one uses when selling a million dollar Taurus
I was expecting to see a crazy luxurious and high Tech and interior but I am quite disappointed. I don't know what a one million dollar interior on a luxury Sedan would look like but this definitely is not it.  The 2021 Genesis G80 has a nicer dashboard than even this car and the New G90 has an even nicer backseat. I think at that point they just screwed themselves over. A 100K dollar 7 series or Lexus LS even do it better.  Need I mention that it still has an analog instrument panel, a screen under 10", and a manual trunk lid as well as fixed rear seats. Yikes 100000000000000000000000.
Front used to look like Ford, now Honda Accord🤣🤣
I'm shocked by how overpriced it is. I mean come on when you climb into a Maybach you have more and even better features not even talking about comfort and level of detail. If my memory is correct you can buy like 4 or 5 Maybachs for the price of that. Do your choice folks.
the front looks like ford explorer
So it’s basically an Aston Martin Rapide with a leather ceiling and different styling. And that makes it a million dollars?
Ugly car.
Alternative title "Overpriced Mazda 6 Arabic cousin"
Ugly pricy and classy.. This cars like interllectual mastabation
Incredible car. To bad about the paint scheme on this one.
I’ve been in many Aston martins over my short life time and this interior is almost identical to normal main stream production cars. Looks sick tho.
It’s a 2018 but has the interior of a 2010...
No one gonna say anything about that sexy ass centenario roadster? Just me? Ok.
Beautiful car but poor person like me can only dream about it
It looks like a Honda Accord
Looks like the front of the accord
"you can place the doors exactly where you want and they will stay there"  *door moving all over the place*
It is a beauty, i actually like the matte on it too
I thought the interior would be made out of poor people.
Fun fact: Taraf or ترف Actually means luxury, affluence and opulence. Aka too much money at hand.
In my native malay language “Taraf” mean “Status”.
This car is not even worth a fraction of that price tag. The quality of its engine & materials will never hold up. The Lexus LS  beats this in spades.
The only thing beautiful in this car is the engine,  anything else looks normal and definitely not worth 20% of it's price
No way it is a 1m car.
Interior is disappointing, a royals royal or a maybach is way superior for much less price
Awful looking car
I knew I wasn't the only one who thought this car doesn't look like it's worth $1M. At least not with those headlights lmao
Looks a lot like an Alfa 166.
It's not that beautiful.  It looks like a 4 door Vantage, what are you smoking?  I could argue a 2004 300C looks more attractive.
“Aston Martins luxury brand” as if Aston Martin is already a luxury brand 😂
scotty told me this is a money pit
Doug seriously needs a good haircut
"You won't encounter a sedan this beautiful" Nah man, the phantom, the Bentley flying spur, defiantly at least as nice looking as this thing. The money for being rare is totally right though.
For a million I thought the car would fly. Or maybe shoot hidden projectiles. This is the biggest waste of a million.
IDK if it's just me but the front end looks similar to the 2020 honda accord 👀
I love how Doug refers to 2018 as "that era"
Doug.. just no.. this is hideous
I don't understand what makes this car $1m and I especially don't understand why Doug gave it a 10 for styling.
Seems a bit dated in the interior and features for a 2018.
All Aston Martin doors stay open in the same place.
1 million dollars for a refreshed rapid.
the most beautiful sedan ever made? Well good thing that's just your opinion, because that idea is laughable
I bet the dealership person  would be standing behind the vamera waiting for any criticism and he can kick the doug out of the property 😁😁🙏
Why df are you talking while accelerating you egotistical bag of twigs
Incredibly underwhelming car from the looks of it, especially for 1mil. Looks kinda like they slapped it together with spare parts. They didn't even make the slots on the rotors face the same way.... penny pinching cheapos!
That's an Aston Martin? I couldn't tell lmao
Aston Martin: stamps lagonda logo on a paper cup. Doug: notice how they didn't use the aston martin logo, they didnt make many of these limited edition lagonda paper cups, and thats pretty cool!
Oh now I know why this car cost around $1Million......it comes with an umbrella !
Does the car name appear anywhere on it? It is missing alot of must have features like intelligent cruise control and ventilated seats.  Why bother shipping it to Beverly Hills, Ca?  It cannot be licensed here.
That car is terrible.
What is the Lamborghini at the start called?
How much are you getting paid to sell this?
I saw that exact one at the dealership
Aston Martins are very beautiful and special. But i would NEVER buy one if I Could.. every mercedes is better
Who telled you that taraf means ultimate luxury, I'm Lebanese and it means nothing in Arabic
SCAM ALERT!!!  SCAM ALERT!!!  SCAM ALERT!!!
Front end looks like a Genesis
There not that particular or you wouldn't be getting cheap  ford switches.
it just looks like a riced out ford fusion
The dealership had trouble shipping this expensive disappointment, and made a deal for Doug to review it for exposure.  Doug cant shit on it since the dealership providers him regularly with exclusive models, and its close to his house which hè cant afford tot piss off.  Hence the ridiculous score
Is that like a little teaser now, cars and bids promotes the new car to be reviewed next, now the centenario 😏
Can someone tell me which model is that Lamborghini in his CarsAndBids ad?
I know this has nothing to do with the lag onda but damn do I want that Datsun 280ZX. Too bad someone already bought it and I’m not even able to drive it😢
If your not going to punch the throttle your wasting our time! Boring
It’s like a car from grand theft auto
thisssss is the null car.
couldn't even hide that hydraulic in the door, wow this thing is a joke
Did anyone else notice the chipped rear window and the fact that he had to keep catching the door while showing off how it didn't move and stayed in place on its own?
The most beautiful car I have ever seen
😱styling 10? You're Crazy Mr. Doug.
Thought for sure it was a 2008 or 9
Car max would be like: $2,500
THIS, is the lowest budget "big" car channel on YouTube, and IT IS ... a crime.
Its not worth that price
It trully looks like a car from GTA V
that door hydraulic wtf why isnt it inside the door? why is it on the outside of it like that?  Also...Doug....come on mate... it's  really NOT that good to look at.. in fact it's quite dull. Are you trying not to disappoint the owner?
Everyone here missed the point Doug made entirely. You’re not paying to be impressed by tech or luxury. You’re paying for exclusivity. Someone with lots of money who wants something no one else has. Believe me, there’s a market for that. And it’s definitely not you. Now go get richer...
Was that a Centinario?
Random thought: I predict that the tachometer of the next generation Land Rover Range Rover will rev anticlockwise.
ZF 6 speed or a 8 speed. The Rapid latest rapide has a ZF 8 speed.
And that’s how you burn 1 milion $
He love throwing shade at that exquisite beauty of a vehicle.
The front looks like an uglier mazda 3 lol
This looks like a Honda Accord
I’ll buy a rolls Royce any day over this shit if I had a million dollars
For a million I’d want a V16 XD
Aston Martin sells this car for a million Karma  hit Aston Martin hard .
10:00 Have you noticed that when he tries the back doors to show that they stay where you put them, at some point he almost closes it and it doesn't stay put so he stops it. :)) and a couple of moments later, he wants to leave it at the same place and he remembers that it's not a good idea.
Ford fusion looking ass
I feel like Doug is trying to be sarcastic this whole video
It looks like a Dodge Charger with a body kit
sure, it's beautiful, but the front looks like a better looking version of the ford fusion. it's beautiful, but it does not speak a million bucks.
its not beautiful.. .. it looks like a fucking Taurus
this is very ugly ngl. not worth $1M at all.
Great video Doug. What was the paint finish. I m only half way through the video so I might look like a Twat. 🇬🇧🇺🇸🇬🇧❤️
junk
I take the flying Spur over this million times over
Its like a old alfa romeo 156 with a million dollar hmmm what happen to the world
24:10 That armrest is down.
No, sorry, Doug...the proportions are mostly good, the lines are clear but inconsequential and a bit lame in some places. The grill is disgustingly Peugeot 207 and the headlights look cheap. This is a good looking car overall but not a standout.  I wanted to make a list of prettier 4door cars but it broke YouTube so I shortened it to "most BMWs, most new Benzes, some Kias and Fords, Maserati and Volvo...
So it's a Rapide with an $800,000 styling package.
at first... i thought it was "Aston Martin Laguna Turf, model"  :) it's very luxurious.
million dollars and those cheap ass wheels
Is it electric or did he (again) forgot to show us how it sounds like? Aston Martins sound is one of the unique selling points, but he's not showing it. Bummer..
Looks like a Chevy
*Quirks and Features at a Level 6 with deeper Dougscores at a Level 7*  _Okay, enough YouTube for today..._
Looks like a GTA car ........
So it has mechanism which helps to keep doors in every possible position, but it doesn’t have soft close mechanism. A bit strange for 1 million dollar car.
Doug is the Gordan Ramsey of cars
It is a very nice car but for $1 million I would look at the person Driving and laugh knowing they got ripped off
Doug you officially lost credibility in your doug scoring
I'd rather take the two phantoms you were talking about
Uhh it's okay
Real question is when is that Centenario vid coming?
The headrest of the backseats looks tremendous uncomfortable!
So You're telling me, by any chance if i had Million dollar i should buy this instead of G-Wagon 6X6 or a speced out RR. Interesting.
Looks like a ford mondeo
500k overpriced... At least.
Kinda looks like a Dodge Charger from the front lol
Don't know about this one chief. It looks good but not quite perfect, the paint makes it look kinda cheap and the luxury is not that good for that price. Wouldn't pay more than 200k for this one even though it's really rare.
Never thought I’d say this, but I’d rather save money and buy a Rolls Royce
Imo the rapide is much more beautyful
Look like Chrysler
7:39 it looks like an ND MX 5 from this angle
12:00 100k for that handle on pillar.....
Can't wait for the Lamborghini/Bugatti looking car Review.
Max 200k. Not a penny more.
At the beginning I was getting excited because I was wondering what the inside of a million dollar car would even look like.       ...I was VERY disappointed
This looks like something a 6th grade would draw in the back of math class. I’ve seen minivans with better styling. This is a pathetic ripoff for people who think they’re special snowflakes because nobody else has it.
Shit
If I wanted to spend a million dollars on a fast luxury sedan I'd just buy two Brabus Rockets
Idk why you guys are surprised doug was a sellout from the start
hows this 1 million? looks about 200k
I think its hideous....front end is the worst!! Better get your eyes checked Doug! 😂
I love how wealthy people from the middle east who, if I'm not to be mistaken, live in the desert do want low, sleek and sexy sedans while North Americans and Europeans, turn to cheesy faux-roaders. Sorry (not actually sorry) to say, it's not the arabs and chinese who are ruining everything nice, they're the ones who are saving it.
Love you Dougy but your bias towards British cars is almost vulgar 😂
Of course, a wonderful car. But overall, I feel like it's a long wheel base Rapide. Which would make it super over priced. For a 2018 model, it's way behind on technology. Very poor and cheap navigation and an analog dashboard!
When American car maker Wilbur Gunn started making cars in Staines on the far western extremity of London (near to Runnymede, where the barons forced King John to sign the Magna Carta, fact fans) in 1903, he took the Native American name for smooth-running stream, la ohonda, and anglicised it to Lagonda for his range of ultra high end sporting chariots.
Whoever buys this than a Bentley or RR is nuts. This car is only marginally luxurious because the interior is covered in leather. The details sucks.
For 1 Million dollars, i do not want my car to look like a Honda Accord on steroids. This Lagonda is nowhere near as distinctive and eye-catching as a Rolls Royce. Even the Genesis G90 and Jaguar XJ can make a bigger statement on the street. The interior is bland and not memorable at all. Too much leather of the same color. The dashboard is not exciting or modern. It just seems copy-pasted from another Aston. And that umbrella thrown casually in the trunk? Such an afterthough. It almost feels like Aston remembered at the last second that they're building a car to compete with the Rolls. Not to mention the exposed fridge vent in the back. Complete lack of attention to detail.   To conclude, the car lacks distinctiveness. It lacks individuality and presence. It does not scream "Expensive" like a Rolls or a Bentley do. If i see this on the street, i would not immediately know it is a 1 Million Dollar car. The further you look into it, the more it dissapoints.     But, congratulaions to the fine folk who own one of these. I would not say your money is wisely spent, but, you definitely have something to brag over at the dinner party.
The comment section has people complaining about the price tag. Doug already clarified that it ain't worth it but you're paying for the exclusivity. Ya'll should watch to understand and not to talk. Regardless, I'm not gonna be buying this even though I had the cash.
14:18 This little what?
still waiting for the part of the video where the price tag is justified
We wright "Taraf" in Arabic  ترف....😍   Its means ultimate luxury as you say in  29:50    By the way "Taraf" is a girl name  😍
The sad story, 1.2M most expensive sedan uses iPad Mini as RES...
Take a shot every time he says distinctive
It’s a Dodge Challenger mixed with a Audi 🤣🤦🏼‍♂️ it’s fugly and isn’t worth close to 1 million. I like my b7 way better than this. And the interior color is 😝
Nobody gonna comment the ad is done with a Centenario?
Doug I’ll pay you a million dollars each time you say “Taraf”
Jesus that sterling wheel looks like a Ford or something.
The Interior seems cluster-phobic but definitely cool
so its an S-class competitor for 10x the price
Interesting. You mentioned Maserati and Eric Clapton in this review.
Most expensive ford fusion
Rigged Doug score
I guess that's the price you pay for exclusivity.  Surely not "worth it", but for certain dumbfucks (the Taraf name indicates the silly target audience) I'm sure the more it costs the more desirable it is!  That said, it looks fantastic.
Oh please... the only reason it was so expensive was because the production run was soo limited
it just looks like a 2015ish Mondeo that’s been wrapped matte black
Doug's knees got hella mileage
Doug made a business decision by calling this overpriced turd beautiful.  If he was actually honest, his review would begin like: "Thiiiiiiiiiis is a truly hideous car".
03:33 !!! Breathe taking beautiful !!! If this is beautiful dear Doug please change your opinion about PT Cruiser ... by the way i hope they don’t bringing it to Middle East because no one will buy it
Well not to brag but my 97 Jeep Wrangler also has luxurious doors, I can place them anywhere even touching the  fender
The radio display is the same as the one on my 2000€ Volvo but blue :))
You can see "Aston Martin" inside Lagonda's navigation screen
Another depreciation disaster  ;) I do like the clean yet contoured lines of this thing though especially the front and back end. The front end reminds me of a VW Arteon. Let's make it electric.  It is rather inexcusable that at 1 million bucks (a silly pricetag) you get a crappy looking steering wheel and cheap looking Ford bits in the front. This is especially silly since they bothered to cover the seat belt buckles.
This dude is at Beverly Hills at Wilshire Blvd
So they offer rear heated seats in the middle East? Interesting...
In 5 years this car will worth 80 grands
is everyone gonna ignore the centinario
That incredible long beard...
What a joke of a car
I would love to see doug review a classic muscle car or 50s car especially considering that had very cool designs and some of them had very interesting fuel door locations
This looks like the new Hyundai Elantra. If Hyundai made the new Sonata look like the new Elantra, it would look like this Lagonda.  All the cars that look better than this: The facelift W222 S63/S65 Sedan, the 2020 Bentley Flying Spur, the upcoming Rolls Royce Ghost, the Phantom 8, your mom, the BMW M8 Competition Gran Coupe, the 2021 BMW M5 Competition, Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid.
Every time he says, "You're paying for the rarity," I cringe. At this level, you're paying for exclusivity, not rarity. Oh well, what can one expect from our cargo shorts buddy?
Is it me or does the front look like a Ford fusion with a bigger grille?
Does anybody else feel like maybe Doug got paid to review this? I don’t know it just feels out of character for him to gush over a vehicle this much. Or maybe it’s just me, but if I had a million dollars there’s a lot of very unique vehicles out there you can get. I really don’t see what the big deal about this one is. Yeah production is very limited, yeah it’s rare, but honestly speaking, the quality doesn’t seem that good. Nothing about this vehicle looks like $500,000 let alone a million. Who’d spend a million dollars in a vehicle like this? Doug said you don’t pay for the luxury but the for the rarity. Really? A million dollars to have a subpar quality rare vehicle? No thanks. Not even if I had 100 million dollars. Don’t get me wrong, it is a nice vehicle. But I think it’s $300,000 tops $500,000 nice.
THISSS is a piece of hot garbage custom made for sheikhs and saudi princes with barrels of oil stuck up their bottoms. No wonder it looks so ugly. 1 mil is chump change for them, they would throw that on one night with a girl trafficked from eastern Europe.  Doug has turned into a sellout hack. Unsubscribed.
A million dollar car with  a dot matrix readout between the gorgeous gauges?  It doesn't make sense.
Am i the only one who thinks the grill looks like a mondeo?
obviously they are targeting the fat pocket of the big belly  in gulf countries.
I'm sorry... What!!! Ford turn signal... Borrowed parts... For a million dollars....! 🤷🏾‍♂️. No..... No no no no....!!
5:01 they didn't want to put plastic panel on B-pillar but thet put key hole on doors...👏🏻
How does he think this car it’s beautiful, in mu opinion it’s ugly and weird af and he gave the maserati gran turismo a 6...
I consider myself insulted whenever i see a car and can't tell what it is...sometimes "challenged" instead but i don't like it. Thiiiisssssss gave me that feeling and after 30 seconds I knew why: never cared until now, these things only work for me in a doug video
...what a joke of a review
looks like genesis banged an aston, in matte
I disagree. The Lamborghini Estoque is the best looking sedan
This car is a joke.
I know it's subjective, but ngl Doug, from the side it looks like a cross between a Hyundai and a Challenger and i think it looks kinda pants. Especially for 1 million dollars
I love Aston Martin cars, Bit this is a joke. Get yourself a Mercedes S-Class and give it to the German company „Neidfaktor“ and you have a luxurious, unique, perfect quality car.
Let's face it, it only costs that much because they had to spread the development costs across 150 units. Beautiful looking car though, and I like the simplicity of the interior. Gadgets do not make luxury for me.
Doug, wipe your knees off before sitting in the back of a million dollar car.   You made me nervous.
check out my new honda accord.... oh wait.
I like the Rolls Royce better, don't get me wrong it is a beautiful car.
Do more people think from the front this car looks a lot like the Alfa Romeo Brera?
1 million... my Tucson is better  What a shame!
3:43      Uhhh wtf Doug have you lost your mind?? “EVER SEEN”? Ever?
It looks like a 30k$ sedan... this is not more beautifull than a bentley or phantom or maybach. It s just overpriced Aston martin rapide s with some ford design.
Let's be honest here, the DB9 looks far nicer and cheaper than this waay overpriced sedan which Doug is ass-kissing it for some reason.
The steering wheel looks awful
Doug: “the most beautiful car” Me: “looks like Hyundai”
This car looks like the generic sedan you see in gta
"Employer: -Ok, boss.. the car is finished.. what price tag will have this one? Boss: - Will cost 1mil$... now get the fuck out.. I want to smoke my Cubanese cigar In peace..."
I thought that Aston Martin only made coupes, but I guess that everything has a first time, just like Lamborghini making a SUV, Aston Martin made a 4 door luxury car
An accord with a genesis badge
What’s with the Honda Accord headlights
oh no. This car max $80 k . I dont care if they build only one.
I'd like to have Phil Jefferies job (-;
Reminds me of the accord front end
This is Doug's worst review. No I don't have a million dollars to spend on it but even if I had 1 million dollars every month I wouldn't buy this. Looks are subjective, ye it's a beautiful sedan, but I'd take the styling of an E46 over this any time of the day so looks won't justify this price ever. A Bentley Continental is by far a much better overall sedan and it's worth a quarter of the money. If this was 200k maybe but anything more is just overpriced. This is no better than an E300 with minimal options. Rarity doesn't justify an MSRP of 1 million when you lack base luxury sedan features.
The middle glass ... If he found it first at the 1st gen CLS , he would mock it....
Maybe for million yen, perhaps  💴
I thought the fender signal light was the door handle🤣🤣high af
Taraf does not mean luxury it's a name and it means someone who lives a wealthy or happy life
Doug the type of dude to review his girl when introducing her to someone
My 2016 Fiat Tipo (21.000€ car) has a cap less fuel system 😂
This car is disappointing,Rolls Royce is far better,even looks better in my opinion,for half its money.
Made for sale in the middle east but they decided to spread some out around the world. In other words they couldnt sell them all in the middle east.  If i had a million dollars to spend on one car this would not be that car. For the interior even the Lincoln Aviator has a nicer interior and it won't cost you a million bucks.
Taruf  ta ruf it ta ruf not taraf
This is such a stupid car !!!
Lol A joke for a Million
front end low-key looks like the new accord lmao
head light design reminds me of an I8
"from this era"
This car is literally an Aston Martin Rapide slightly stretched with a body kit designed for petro dollars holders
Yeah... I'd take those two Phantoms.
Fun fact: you can find one of these non driven for around 500k now.
A One million dollar joke 🤦‍♂️
If you purchase this car, you, should be kicked in the balls a 1 millions times. I rather spend $1 million dollars on Kanye west presidential campaign
Lol million dollar sedan and they couldn’t figure out a way to get rid of the key lock on the drivers door..!!!!! 🤦🏼‍♂️
This is worth about 1 000 000 times less than what it sells for.
The original 80s lagonda was worth its original asking price, not this. I might forgive it if it had a significantly more powerful engine but it’s just the same 6.0 V12 as in the Rapide. Maybe if it was supercharged or turboed with 700+ hp but this was clearly a cash grab by Aston.
I don't why I keep thinking of Audi  S8?!!
I live in the middle east and i never knew this car ever existed👁👄👁
Indeed a very nice car. Except the color, thats more kardashian
$1 million for a hideous car that shares parts with a Ford Focus and uses a cheap Garmin navigation system???  Seriously?
Jaguars look million dollar better tho
Lagonda Forever!
Missing so many features that even the $900k cheaper MB S Class has. Should have been priced at $70k to compete with the E-Class/5 Series/A6. Also looks boring especially in this matte black...
I do believe that the detailing applied to the leather seating would be considered a " BROGUE  " detail.... Like the shoes.
Doug teasing the Centenario review
The Rapide looked better than this  lmao, what is doug smoking
This car don't deserve that amount.
The time that I've wasted is my biggest regret Spent in these places I will never forget.Just sitting and thinking about the things that I've done The crying, the laughing, the hurt and the fun. Now it's just me and my hard driven guilt, Behind a wall of emptiness I allowed to be built.I'm trapped in my body, just wanting to run Back to my youth with its laughter and fun.But the chase is over and there's no place to hide Everything is gone, including my pride.With reality suddenly right in my face I'm scared, alone and stuck in this place. Now memories of the past flash through my head And the pain is obvious by the tears that I shed. I ask myself why and where I went wrong I guess I was weak when I had to be strong. Living for the drugs and the wings I had grown My feelings were lost, afraid to be shown. As I look at my past it's so easy to see The fear that I had, afraid to be me. I'd pretend to be rugged, so fast and so cool, When actually lost like a blinded old fool. I'm getting too old for this tiresome game Of acting real hard with no sense of shame.It's time that I change and get on with my life Fulfilling my dreams for a family and wife. What my future will hold I really don't know. But the years that I've wasted are starting to show. I just live for the day when I'll get a new start and the dreams I still hold deep in my heart. I hope I can make it, I at least have to try.Because I'm heading toward death, and I don't want to die.
Biggest piece of garbage on 4wheels.
There's nothing worth a million bucks for this Lagonda. 240k MAX  16:24 my point lol
Even if i had $$ I wouldn’t buy this car for that price
Yikes the half-baked takes here. It's $1M because it's a modification of a sports car platform and built to extremely small numbers. Economies of scale and such. Comparing it to other cars on cost doesn't quite work. This is a beautifully proportioned car.
Imagine if Dug crashed this car.... that would be some bill.....
I had seen pictures of this when it first came out..  It's interesting to see it reviewed, and you've shown it the respect it deserves.    There is one thing I'd wonder about with a car like this.  Did it make any money?  Even with off the shelf components, that body and structure are somewhat bespoke.  In some countries, that requires testing and certification.  That may be the reason it was never sold in the U.S.  It would have cost a million dollars for each car sold...
Can you please review a 986 Porsche Boxster S a super affordable Porsche with a 911 motor and transmission, I'm in my mid to late 20's and I've been eyeing them up lately especially since they're like 10-20k cheaper then the 996 Carrera 4 S even though they have like 90% of the same parts.   Thanks Doug, I love your videos and have watched damn near everyone for a few years now and always excited to see what's next!
pretty much a car for Saudi Arabians who just want to flex that they have a rare million dollar car.
A million dollars and no sunroof?  That's tough. 🤔
DB9s on Autotrader are starting at about £25k, Rapides low thirties. Even the nicest examples possible are under £150k...
Some arab kid: *My dads Aston Martin coasts 1M$* Me: *well lemme check tht turn signal stalk*
1 million for that shitty info system
Did u ever notice that the cars he stand behind in car and bids ad is the next one he will review
I honestly would rather have a 2010 db9...
Lagonda Giraffe
Doug if you are held hostage by an oil sheikh trying to flip this ugly car, blink three times
Hands up from who thinks Doug tried to say 'Cool' one million times?! 🖖  The review was great but just didn't point out one noticeable fact - this car is NOT worth one million dollars in any way, shape or form. It is not even that beautiful, especially when it comes from a company that does the DB9 and the Rapide. I would have these two instead of the Lagonda and use the rest of the money in more interesting stuff.
Research and development (R&D) is one reason for the $Million price tag.
Exclusivity
😳I must admit, that side profile is second to none!
My Kia stonic have tinted windows from the factory and a 1 million dollar car isn’t?
Imagine if Doug got into an accident
The Volkswagen Phaeton of the luxury world.
I once saw this 50 meters left to my real estate gate. Address: Lane 58 Xingeng Road, Shanghai, China. I ain’t kidding. I was shocked.
Lagonda sounds like the name of some kind of lake filled with alligators in florida
Rapide copycat with a jacked up price. These will not sell all units....Watch
Ridiculously overpriced
I saw one of these to day at DXB mall and I said dam it looks like a million dollars and the guys said it is and got his kids out of the back
"Honey what are we having for dinner" Wife: "lagonda with chicken"
The Doors stopping wherever you leave them also came standard in my 2014 Panamera that i used to own. Not that special for a car that costs almost 10 times the amount that the Panamera costs..
It’s an amazing car but it’s not really a pretty car
"You don't have a million dollars to spend...". Nice one Doug, talk down to your audience 👍
IMHO, this car isn’t worth more than $200k, SOLELY because it’s an Aston Martin.  Sad to see a great manufacturer produce some absolute garbage.
Hm.......Nah.
6:25....Honda Accord.....its a Honda Accord lol
*no ceiling window ?!*
I like how Doug casually is advertising Cars & Bids in front of a Centenario Roadster...just...no big deal
With those headlights and grille, it kinda looks like a Jetta
$1m? Give me a Rolls Phantom coupe and fuck everything else I'll swim in the left over cash.
They could have went all out and call it the Aston Martin DB Dubai. Are there really more than 100 rich sheik kids in the middle east? I always underestimate how many of those guys there actually are.
Looks like a mix between a fusion and one of the new accords....
13:25 I've always wondered what uncircumcised seat buckles look like.
The logonda is a rip off I wouldn't buy it for 200k never mind a mill
you pouched a lot of things with that finger, i guess...
Not to sound like an 8 year old but this looks as if it's straight off GTA
@10:03 “It will stay exactly theree” door begins to close 😂
Not a single thing about this car justifies the price
The front looks like a BMW i8 with a ford grille
Nice...A Lincoln Continental done Right. This is the Ruler of Another Country type of Car..
Wow is this car shit for its price.
I'd argue that my 2019 Dodge charger scat pack looks better.
Beautiful car but not worth the price, I’d rather get a ghost than the lagonda, let alone the phantom.
I don’t see 1M there tbh
If you're looking for something that looks like a Peugeot 408 crossed with an Austin Princess with a paint finish that looks like it was done by some bloke with a brush and a tin of Ronseal, this may be for you.
looking at ford turn signal, is that drywall screw?
Guess what guys ? This made me appreciate my dad’s Corolla better. Thanks Doug.
Take a shot for every time Doug says “distinctive” in this video. So far I’m about to black out.
Will sell it and buy a Lexus ES 350
Just a plot twist, doug starts his cars and bids intro with the next car he's about to review, can't wait for the Lamborghini Centanario
The interior color is what I threw up when I ate too much tomato soup as a child.
It's kinda ugly though
This car is so goodlooking it shouldnt be Halal
I wanna know who the F is buying these? Million bucks are you kidding me. I don’t care if there is 5 in the world. It’s not full of features and tech for comparable price cars sorry
Doug, when you say this is the moest beautiful car in the world?, you most olso say that you are en idiot
ARAB MONEY
*Puts Push button transmission * Imagine controlling the temperature and the next moment ur driving in reverse !
@ 11:27... yeah, that almost justifies the price- They chose a leather that costs... probably $7,000 (their cost) to do the entire interior. So selling the car for an extra 100x's what THAT cost them... only makes sense.  (hahaha)
Roof stitches are not aligned correctly 😅😅😅
I’m just not seeing anything on this car that would make me want to spent $200k, let alone $1m
You should never, ever, find plastic anywhere in a million dollar car.
Wheels looking like cheap after market ones imho
It looks like a GTA car, and one of the cheap ones ...
doug is a both knees on the floor type of guy
This car really doesn't look good on camera though?
Just looks like a new Honda accord
Just sum junk
$1,000,000 for this car! I ll buy it, that’s cheap 😂.
How much did Aston Martin pay you ?
Does anyone else  think the front looks like a honda accord???
Lol IT looks so tacky with matte paint
Looks like a Honda Accord
This looks like a stretched Ford fusion, Aston definitely paid for this review. Aston is dying
nasty exterior profile
I can see this car breaking and falling apart when it gets older...all those quirks are probably not made to last. This car doesn't seem like it should be priced at nearly $1M, the digital displays look like it was from the original NES...cheaply made. The only thing buyers will get from this is the name and the fact that Aston Martin made only 120 of them. My 2014 Explorer Sport has more tech than this
Ford Fusion looks much better than this. Feels cheap
For the price, this sucks big time.
Looks like it's dipped in plastic.
For 1mill ud hope to be able to stretch ur legs!!
Doug's the type of guy to be the FIRST [guy] to break through Supercar Blondie's ["female"] barrier of ridiculous "Supercar" reviews that the public is better of not even knowing about. LOL
Bizarre and ridiculous car. Completely overpriced
I like cars ..... but I never heard of it ..... ??? 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Overpriced ASS!-ton Martin. I'd rather a Lada.
I love how doug was angry at maserati for using crysler switches on a 70k car but is ok with putting ford focus switches on a car that is worth $1,200,000.00
1 million$$??????NO WAY !!!!!!  NEVER !!! This is worth 90.000$
why does the side look like a honda accord 😭
Lincoln Continental/Mercedes Maybach/Aston Martin Lagonda
I’m a peasant and this does not impress me in the slightest
Maserati is that you?
Say LAGONDA one more time! I dare you!!!
If this is luxury then leave RR alone...I don't know what you'd call my Jockey underwear (phfft phfft ..ultra luxurious)
I thought that by now, we, Doug fans, would all know about how much exclusivity and rarity add to final price, bur no...
I’ve never been more underwhelmed
Driving on Little Santa Monica Blvd haha
Daylight robbery I tell you..
Aston Martin needs to stop trying for luxury with lagondas. They dont match to bentlyey or rolls royce for quality
doesn't look like 1 million thingy!
27:45 so the answers no
looks like a genesis
front looks like a dodge dart lmao
Am I the only one who sees a extended Ford Fusion Lol
Can you do a review on a 1990 Nissan Laurel?
My 2010 Audi A8 had the B&O rising tweeters. The navigation is laughable the interior is absolutely beautiful. This car is "Art over Function", that is why the price is justified for those who are worth 100 million plus. How many of "those" are there worldwide? 24,000, one lagonda for every 200 ultra rich. Price explained!!
the wheels kinda ruin the whole aesthetic of the car, they look cheap.
Doug lost whatever shred of credibility he ever had when he called this Lagonda "beautiful".  It's ATROCIOUS.
With the Koenigsegg Gemera coming out, I would love to see a competing model from Pagani. Could you you imagine how beautiful it would be?
Your reviews are as good as your website. Complete trash.
Doug the kinda guy who forgets to add *sponsored* in front of his video titles
I see absolutely NOTHING, NOTHING to make this car worth over $200k dollars, much less $1.000.000!!! It is NOT BEAUTIFUL, much the contrary, it is UGLY!!! A $1.000.000 car, that has a place to unlock the doors with a KEY??? REALLY??? No reclining rear seats, like Rolls Royce, Maybach, or even the Hyunday GENESIS, that goes for ONLY $70K??? A CHEAP "GARMIN" screen??? FORD PARTS??? MAN, WHAT makes this car worth $1.000.000??? NOTHING!!! One thing thou is BEAUTIFUL for all Aston Martins, and that is the leather... GORGEOUS! I guess that makes the car worth... $200k... maybe!?!?
Paint job score 0 (no paint job was there?) BTW & FYI it's Aston, not Astin.
What a rip off
So it's a glorified Rapide, g r e a t
Aston Martin : I am the best luxury sedan.  Bentley flying spur : Am i a joke to you?
Id expect a little pe than a ford fusiin front grille and exhaust tips. Side profile of a new charger. Most beautiful ever? Try again
NOTHING in that car says million dollars. I have 2020 X5 M series and seems it has more luxurious features
Genesis G80 or whatever looks waayyyyyyyyyyyyyy better than this.
10:20 that is ugly
Tech is litterally from 06-07
Come on Doug, first you justify the price of a Harley Davidson Edition GMC Sierra and now this?  What happened to your objective opinions.  It's a Rapide that will soon be on More Doug Demuro as an Ultra Luxury Bargain.
100K car all day long.
A review of that lambo better be coming
Doug one word  Biased
The accord front though lmao
1 million its nice    But i don't how , RR phantom 8 cost approximately  2 milion dollars in india 😕😕.  Edit : base model 1.5 million dollars
Highly overpriced My hyundai i20 has so many features like this car. Eg door opening dampers, front drl turn signals, refrigerated compartment. It cost me $10k  LoL
Looks like Ford, Audi, Chrysler and Polestar got together and made an electric concept car, but at the last second stuck a gas engine in.
Doug, the Last generation Mercedes S class does the door staying open trick too.
The amount of times Doug mentions the Lagonda logo ruined the video.
You're spending $1,000,000 because the rich have too much.
No offence, but I personally think it looks like a car that would be in gta 5.
$1 million and no pano roof.
Fucking swan doors with hydraulic  hinges for 1 million dollars but no soft close
Doug 15 years from now: “THIS...  is the WORST limited-production car Aston ever made”
IMO its ugly .  sorry
“A intensely beautiful design”? Yikes! The look is off IMO. C-pillar is ugly with terrible proportions. Not to mention that it looks like a $70K car with lots of plastics. Wrapping the car in leather is no luxury.
His favorite word is AND
Scam
Catering to the "More money than brains" crowd.
That car is ugly asf
Very clever name. It’s called Taraf wich means ’sided’ in turkish. Makes sence for its sales targets. Why didn’t they named it Tartuffe like Molière’s book. That means hypocrite. It makes a lot more sence when you take it’s price and looks. Why this car has B pillar? I mean for example in Renault Avantime it looked so good when all windows were all the way down + Could add suicide doors. This is just boring.  I mean when you look at work of famous italian car body makers back in time. Personally still prefer Aston Zagato models. They look great. This however looks like an prototype from early developing stage of a normal old Aston model. Very disapointing.
Barfed from licking this shit
so, just a small loan of 1 million dollars as for the car itself, very pretty outside, modern basic interior with more leather than normal aaaaand its shit for the price cant compete with rolls royce
The Phantom is better
Looks like a new honda accord from the front so idk man
Looks like a late 90s Chrysler.   A fool with oil money and his wealth are soon parted
@0:38 Now that's nice car👍👍
AM can make some great cars, but their UX is so quirky. Makes a good car worthless.
Technically the Taraf and the Rapide are mechanically the same.
What the fuck ? i can’t believe someone would buy this peace .. it’s a S65 AMG with five times the price...
0:50 shows a Lamborghini racecar rental then proceeds with a 1992 Mercedes on the actual website 😂😂
Theyre trying to milk milionaire money at this point and it doesn't even look that good
Doug should have held his pinky to his mouth while saying one million dollars.
This car makes a Rolls Royce look like a sensible purchase.
New camry is still better
If you told me this car costed $200k I would still not be impressed, class interior and 7 series are on par if not better for 1/10 the price
Single clutch? No Doug, this is a ZF 8-speed torque converter auto... like the Rapide.
Exclusivity = Luxury...apparently
Anyone else notice how the door sounds like a Mitsubishi Mirage when you close it ?
The 7 bmw 7 series and the s class has a better if not at least as good Interior for 1/10 the price
This feels like more of a joke that any car brand would sell something like this for so much money.  It has some nice features but absolutely nothing that would have me choose it over TWO Phantoms...
That's one ugly car
The front looks like a 2020 accord
This car looks ugly.
Far far away from other luxury sedans like Bentley Flying Spur, Maybach, Rolls Royce and even S-Class and Audi A8...  And the infotainmentsystem looks the same like the old Audi Q3 🤣🤣🤣 But  Nice Car on his own way, much too expensive...
I'm so broke I started crying seeing this
I'd rather a 7 series
It looks like a ford fusion
17:40 litteraly ever Austin Martin does this lol why is he acting so impressed I didn’t he complain about the button for gears in another Austin Martin review
Remove the license plate mount, and that grille / headlight styling is about the best I have seen in the past 20 years.
Quirks & Features > Driving the thing
Love and respect Doug... but I don't think the exterior styling is worthy of his high level of excitement.
looks like a fucking ford fusion
In the year 2037 Hoovie will buy this car for 13,549$
Didn’t even know this existed. Thanks Doug. We love you.
Ugly thing, for too much money,  i shall take the lagonda from 80s miami vice
Wait, so you're saying my Ford focus has the same turn signal as this million dollar car?  Ladies and gentlemen, I pretty much have an Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf.
Taraf in romanian means Folk Music Band.
CHIEF called, he said this car ain't it.
I couldn’t disagree more about the looks it’s massively bland to me. Front end has a fancy charger look back a Ford Fusion. I kinda hate it lol. I like earlier flying spur lol
Am I the only one who thinks that it looks ugly?
Ehh, the Rapide looks better IMHO.
Hmmm? I'll take a Rolls Royce instead. For a million dollars, no included rear seat display units, a Ford Taurus turn signal stock and a Garmin navigation system. Also, no cooled rear seats. The front end looks like a Mazda and the rear a Dodge charger. A Genesis G90 has better luxury.
Its beautiful and all but its missing many things in every aspect, you telling me its built for Middle East filthy rich people, yet it doesn't have chilled seats in the back!!, also I've never seen Doug gives a car 6/10 on acceleration for 4.4 sec!!  This is a total repoff nothing interesting about it at all, but I guess its easy to find 120 stupid and rich to sell this car to.
Well... I would still say that Alfa Romeo 159 is much more beautiful.
Pretty reasonable price for what Arabs are willing to pay
Spend million dollars and gets soft close boot instead of electric boot. Lol
Taraf in arabic (ta-ruf) means an abundance in wealth, lol!
Not worth a million dollars
10:00  Doug: "...and it will staaaay...exactly..."   Lagonda: "I'm sorry Doug, I'm afraid I can't do that"
The lines of the car reminds me a bit of the maseratti quattroporte
$1,000,000 for that??? Must be a money laundering scheme.
this is not a beautiful car at all imo
You’d think the turn signal stock would be aluminum or leather not cheap plastic, also the switches and dials should of been crystals like the Bmw 8 series that costs 1/10th
Kia could build this car for $150 000.
If a Maserati and a Ford Fusion had sex. This would be the outcome. Lol. This is a 2018 car and he refers to the technology of car as if it was from 15 years ago. Lol the car is trash.
It’s a huge ripoff, that’s why they only targeting Middle East countries, they can’t justify this LCD displays type of tech anywhere else in the world. Also, it pronounced TARaF, the second (a) sounds like the ou in word rough, that is by the way a UAE/Kuwait/Saudi Arabia local accent.
24:44 When Ghostbusters are prepping for their next gig
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and in this case I am not seeing the beauty Doug sees. An overpriced rarity that fails do deliver on any front. Ugliest Aston I have seen and that is a true rarity.
An expensive ford fusion
Value due to people wanting it? Na bud. That doesn’t work.
double the price of a phantom, half the quality. british ingenuity
Most beautiful 4 door car? It looks so basic and disgusting for a million 🤨
Why the hell are you obsessing so much about this car. It’s really ugly..and overpriced to hell.
I thought these kind of things are more valuable when you don't take it out of the package.
Who ls misses the  “for more of my thoughts go to auto trader” line?
My man Doug 👍👍👍🇨🇷
Ugly rear end for countryman in Russia will go off-road on this shit. Buy two for his lady. And engine blow off after 70k km...
I'd rather have a 2020 altima if u ask me
Don't like the matte paint or whatever it is nor do i like the color. I have seen better
This is definitely not the most luxurious car I've seen. Rear center stack looks cheap. No massaging seats, no cooled seats... For a middle Eastern market...? Isn't most of the middle East really hot? No champaigne flutes.  Not even a synthetic vagina in the rear arm rest... Pfft...
When it is worth around € 25,000 I might consider buying it.
What's clanking around when Doug takes a turn?
This more beautiful than an BMW E38? The front is really nice, but the back is pretty crappy and the roofline looks like total crap.
This car cost more than my condo here in San Francisco.
What a stupid car. One million for Ford stalks and a crappy plastic fridge. If I am paying a million for a car, I don't want to see a single piece of plastic anywhere.
Its gorgeous to look at but there are other cars that offer way, way more more 1/10 of the price....
The rear doors look a lot like those on 2003-2007 Accord sedans.  Front fascia similar to a Fusion - but better.  I like the way it looks, though.
Is it worth a million bucks?  Doug: Rare and two USB ports
absolutely nothing in this car to command anywhere near the price tag.
What a god awful and outdated steering wheel.
The Polestar One is a better version of this exterior styling.
When you spend a million dollars on a ‘luxury sedan’ and can’t recline rear seat.  When you spend a million dollar and turn signal stalk comes from Ford Focus  Is this the first video where Doug didn’t mention about Cup holders ?
Review begins at 1:12.
I think the 6 series grancoupe is the most beautiful 4door sedan ever, but this does look better than a Panamera without question.
When arabs have too much money.....
24:44 weakest argument I've ever heard Doug give on pricing. IT'S A MILLION DOLLARS! How can you justify spending that much for something that is largely similar or the same as other cars (that cost much less), except for the exterior styling. "You're not paying for the luxury, so much as the rarity and styling". LAGONDA IS ASTON'S LUXURY BRAND!!!  Is he really trying to justify the price just because it's "beautiful" (opinion/subjective) on the outside and "rare" (on purpose from Aston Martin to drive up the price). It's just a Rapide/DB9 with different body. How can that make it so much more expensive? How can that justify the PLASTIC FORD FOCUS turn signal stalk? How can that justify the GARMIN screen (and the pixel screens on the gauges) IN 2018?!? How can that justify the wrinkles in the headliner? How can that justify no massaging rear seats in a clearly rear-passenger focused car? I'm not expecting a crazy out-of-this world interior, but for A MILLION DOLLARS, you'd think Aston would've spent more time and effort on the interior.
Man, that's a very overpriced ugly Honda Accord
imagine paying $1 million for an $100k luxury car....
If ya told me it was like 250k maybe I’d believe you, but $1mil is ridiculous lol anybody who spent that is an idiot
17:47 looks like the engineers tested the radio at their UK factory before exporting. Would be very surprised if Doug got any reception for Talksport DAB in San Diego...
Ok someone need to audit Aston Martin for money laundering, cause I'm not seeing $1 million
My Opel Insignia has a soft close boot.
Mid '90s BMW 3 series are the most beautiful sedans ever made. This is only number 2, maybe. And what an ugly color.
cant belive overall it looses to the panamera turbo the ugliest luxury sedan on the road.
the wheels look kind of after market
I was wondering if Doug was going to review this, after showing this car during his cars and bids intro.   Now I want to see that blue Lamborghini get reviewed.
Gorgeous car. And those Aston V12s 😍
You should just say: if you want to buy or sell a cool car from the modern era 80s and up Cars iand bids is theplace to go
O V E R P R I C E D
Doesn't look like a 1M$ car at all
Looks like a long ass accord
Ah yes, the legendary double t-shrit plus shorts combo to review a million dollar car.  That being said, Doug is the kind of guy who opens up a dating session by asking for the quirks and features of his potential significant other.
It is not that super beautiful from the front , I think you are just under the influence that it costs 1 M USD, a lot of even old 4 doors cars are much more beautiful than her, like Alfa 156/159 for example, new ones like Ferrari GTC Lusso.
REVIEW A 2007 AUDI RS4 B7!
We better get a review of that centenario doug😂
Most of these features are seen in most Aston Martin's though...
10:02 LOL, we saw that, Doug!
Its ugly!!!
This car wouldn’t even turn heads and he is giving the styling a 10. I feel like that opinion is heavily influenced by the badge, price tag and rarity.
This is filmed on the roof of the Petersen Automotive Museum. No wonder they have the only one in North America
hyper-base.do.am
What's Doug smoking?! The Rapide looks better than this thing
pjp-exclusive.ucoz.net
"The Lagonda is the most head turning luxury sedan, period." WTF Doug have you lost your mind??
dougdougdougdoug when are we getting the Fast and Furious S2000 review?
The car looks amazing but this color def makes him looking like a drug dealer type of car
beauty and luxury? WHERE?
1.2 million but you still have the damn key locks visible on the doors. Offfffffffff
This car is the personification of "more money than sense".
"you will not encounter another sedan this beautiful, you will not encounter another one of these maybe in your whole country, no matter where you live" - Don Huayra enters chat https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDDLsWKdoQI
Me: What a cool car Comments: Overpriced!! Me: Overpriced!!
0:38 when you paint a lamborghini like a Bugatti Chiron:
Middle Eastern head ware requires more head room.
It looks like a Hyundai Genesis but with messed up proportions. It's actually nothing special and by no means beautiful...
Taraf Tauraf Tauruf  Taurus Ford Taurus.
So no ventilated seats, no back infotainment, 20 year old navigation system, some bits and pieces straight from the Rapide including the the steering wheel and Ford focus signal stocks, you don’t get this much crap in a 500k Rolls Royce, this does not came even close to a RR, I think that you would get a better deal if you pay a Fiat 500 50k ... A Bmw 7 series ora an S class (not even a Maybach) are far more luxurious than this!
I love that 90's era key hole on the drivers door and how exposed it is.
Amazing car! The quality details are amazingly beautiful. But I still like my Rapide better.
Honestly if you where to shorten the front end and make the windshield rake more normal and not as flat you could tell me this is the new Kia stinger or something
This shit looks like a GTA knockoff car
No tinted rear windows. My father's 20k € Opel Astra has them.
5:20 what era are you referring to because this car is pretty new
It looks like a Dodge Charger
Rapid's ugly sister?
THISS is a million dollar ford fusion
Decided to sell the house where cuz it's not just idiots who live in the Middle East
Successfully wasted 29 mins looking at overpriced shit
Thats one fancy looking jetta
Me: looks at thumbnail* the hell is this? Doug: THIS!!!!!!!!!
DEFINITELY NOT A 9 COOL FACTOR
It’s straight
I feel like the only reason Doug's raving about this car is because its expensive and rare.
The Peterson! I'm curious if it's the museum's collection or if the buyer just loans it to them to meet the show and display requirements for import.
I would just get a Rapide for 45k and maybe spend another 20k on a body kit to make it look like this
Grill looks like a pair of lips kissing... Or perhaps a "vertical smile" if you tilt your head just so...😉
I thought he would mention the exterieur design as his first quirk because it's a bit more on the ugly side... Didn't notice that this would be considered beautiful
I'm gonna stay real here: It's ugly. Literally one of the ugliest sedans I've ever seen. What's that C-Pillar? It looks disgusting... It does not deserve to be called beautiful. A 4 door car just doesn't work with Aston Martin.
*spends 1 million dollars on a car thats the price of a mansion.*  But you can buy a Toyota or a Lexus sedan thats around 30k.
But Toyota Corolla looks better than this good morning 😁
The front looks like an Accord lol
The stupid matte paint turns me off. If i'm about to spend 1 million on a car the paint has to be extraordinary. Not matte black.
Speedometer in Kmh...."because this car wasn't sold in North America.....".  We use Kmh in Canada. I'm just sayin', we are part of North America.
Now i can see why they dont sell it in Europe or America. Its a joke. Its full of plastic, no cooled seats use 10$ navidation. No American or Europien by it. I hope this will never be a classic Aston.
Too bad front Reminds of a Chrysler
$1mil? Aston Martins are very cool but this looks like a Ford Taurus.
the exterior is nice,  the interior is mediocre. probably the biggest rip off i’ve ever seen.
It looks one of gta v cars
مافي أي ترف في الموضوع، رولز رايس هيا الترف الحقيقي
This Ford Fusion is gorgeous
Very good looking car. For $1mil though it must have Level 5 Full Self Driving, all electric drivetrain with solid state batteries, and be made with a newly invented material that doesn't scratch, dent, or rust.
It looks like that an update of that old weird saloon/sedan they made for the Middle Eastern market.
am I the only one having a hard time finding it even average beautiful, let alone how ultimately beautiful Doug thinks it is
Nice to see a 2020 Lagonda has the same door stay pistons that a 2007 BMW E66 has.  Very innovative Aston Martin!
Loved that after thought door shock 😆
shitbox
why not skip the b pillar ??? just glas, Mercedes done it
Doug must be the only journalist to ever review both the old and new Lagonda, or one of very few people.
dough the type of guy at parties watching people eat salt through their nose
Centenario review coming soon? 👁
This car is ugly AF, both exterior and interior.
This car is UGLY 2/10 styling!
Ford parts on a million dollar car. It's a pass.
I actually thought this was a 2020 Honda Accord from the thumbnail
I bet there’s a Honda Accord body kit that could emulate this lol
The scores of this car make me lose trust in the “Doug Score”
honestly, I think an xj6 or a quattroporte looks way better
Very oddly shaped car! Not special at all!
Ugly from any angle and headliner has wrinkles.
After watching this review I can never trust Dougs opinions on cars ever again.
Is this a joke , take out the leather and you have a Toyota Camry ...laughable 🤦🏾
I hope lagonda makes more cars that are priced more at the rolls Royce price point. Gives more options than just rolls and Bentley for these types of cars
Doug is the white guy's white guy
The gauge cluster is trash
Hell no! Maybe $100,000 and that's about it, I'll take the S-Class over this any day.
He will review the Centenario next.
take a shot every time doug says distinctive
beautiful  car, no way it's worth  1mill smfh..
Rooftop of the Petersen?
i prefer maybach
front three quarters looks like a Galant VR4
Doug I do not agree with you it is not the most beautiful 4 door car ah Sorry the RR phantom is wayyyyy nicer and I dont necessarily even care about 4 door land yachts to be honest . That being said beauty is in the eye of the beholder to be sure . So now moving on to your attire still no trip to Target maybe a trip to Ross or Burlington ??? Oh Doug I just shake my head IDK about you bud .Im sure maybe your trying to hold on to your last bit of youth maybe thats why you have the college flop house look  . A polo shirt or a collared shirt would go a long way in your presentation I do hope when you negotiate with any kind of financial backers with the bids and what ever your pushing you at least where a suit you see where the you tube thing is going good for you I just wish you would at least look like you give a dam .
6:23 The grill is not very different than grill from Rapide S, which succeeded standard Rapide. It looks the same to me.
rolls royce is still better.
The car is specifically made for tasteless rich people
Million dollars worth of crap!
That Lambo in the beginning with the Chiron paintjob has got to be one of the most cursed looking cars ever
Fusión/Accord
the front of the car looks like it's pogging.
I stoped watching when I saw that gps display  F... this s....for $1m
I love the little sneak peeks of upcoming cars
Future Hoovies garage purchase?
Doug is the kind of guy to say goodnight to himself before going to sleep
Imagine paying 1mill for what most ppl will think its a honda accord
1mil for just the looks? Coz it got nothing else going for it. Extremely overpriced and playing to the billionaire ego game.
3:34 Are we looking at the same car?
I'll take the S class over this tbh
And I thought the new Tahoe’s were overpriced. Literally nothing here even comes close to justifying that price 😂
it's like a poor concept car that made it to production lol
The flying spur is way more luxurious
They don't seem to change their interiors.
Doug, either your taste in cars has fallen off a cliff (worse than I thought) or Aston Martin paid you A LOT of money to advertise this car. This car is the most overpriced shitbox I've ever seen. It's actually laughable. There is absolutely no way this is the greatest 4 door sedan you've ever seen and there is no way someone with a functioning brain would pay $1 million for this car. The RR Phantom or the Cullinan is 50,000 times nicer and more interesting than this piece of shit--at HALF the cost.
1 million dollars... for..... ? a plastic clip so you can attach your own ipad?!! wow... aston has always been full of themselves, but this is just straight up disdain for your customer
No sunroof, no massage chairs, no cooling back seats. The best thing is that they just keep printing the name Lagonda across the entire car jizzzzss
Looks like a Chevy Camaro from the back and Ford Focus from the front.....🤔
Ugliest, cheapest-looking, yet most ludicrously-expensive and overpriced car I've ever seen.
Am I the only one that sees a Honda accord from the front?
Nice charger doug
First time I am looking Doug's video and think to my self:   how much money did he get to say shit like this
2018?!!! 😱
It looks like a Chrysler
the fisker karma looks better imo
Imagine paying 1 million bucks and you still have a keyhole
Dude that front looks like a Honda Accord lmaooo
its a good looking car, but surely not worth a million bucks. There are much better looking cars  for half the price or less.
Doug: Oh, it's the morning, I sure slept well. I'd say it's worthy of a Doug Score of 8 out of 10.  Oh that's right, this morning I'm reviewing a million dollar car.... Should I comb my hair. No, I'll do it after lunch.
from a distance it looks like a 4 door challenger, not worth 1m.
Front grill likes like Hyundai Elantra:
Breathtakingly beautiful?? Bleagh. But yes i like it. I like some Mercedes or Astons better ironically.
Overpriced Ford Fusion
This is the most disappointing car you ever reviewed imo
I would rather have the old 1980s lagonda than that overpriced thing lol
thank god there are only 120 of them :D
This car is joke. Holly shit
This thing is ugly
This is like large group design project at school to get every feature luxurious
Fugly
Damn those vents look so basic 😂😂
It's ugly!!!
U kept saying when it was introduced but never gave a year it was produced...?
What the hell happend to CNC Motors, did Doug review all of their cars they have?
It looks like a genisis
That shit looks like a Honda Accord
Doug, please use a foam pad for your knees... You’ll thank me 20 years from now.
all i see is a ford fusion
Honestly I love that Doug does the cars and bids intro with cars he is going to review in the future. I get so excited when I see what he’s going to review next
This doesn’t even compare to a Rolls
It will look nice in dark green
It’s just so plain looking. I would stick with the 7 Series as the best looking sedan
I knew I couldn’t be the only here that thought this was an ugly piece of garbage..  but who knows what goes on in the Arab mind? ApParently Aston.
That ain't worth a million dollars dawg.
Punching circles on leather is luxury? Its not even sound insulated! Honestly I was soo interested only for the first 3 mins.
Ford mondeo front end and Maserati rear 1/4 .  Styling is awful . 1/10 .
imagine paying 1 million dollars for this
I have to agree with Doug on this one, it looks beautiful compared to the other bland and somewhat similar looking to eachother sedans
taught it was a 2016 video
Looks like a audi
A chunky Ford Fusion is what came to mind, viewing the front. Hard to understand why that had a 1 million dollar price. The idea of wanting something so exclusive crashes in on its self because hardly anyone will know what it is & it's not very distinctive. The former Langonda, now that's distinct looking.
It's beautiful, but I'm gonna say it. IDC if Aston Martin used it as it's signature style before it became an edgy tend, still looks like a fish
I take it from the radio station this car lived in the UK for while.
You will look thousand times Richer when you having a Rolls Royce phantom
it looks like a car i would draw when i was 7.
Ford focus with lipstick on. This is a shity way to spend a mil
A moment of silence for those who is gonna buy it for $1m...
The thing's ugly, Doug 😑
Just wondering how many cows that to die to make the 120 units of this car.
The front end looks like a Honda Insight. Oops
The only reason that explains the price is the Lagonda turaf logo every where
Designers should have made a better design for $1 million. The angles look off from the windshield to the hood, and the front end looks like an off-brand Giulia grille. It doesn't even look like an Aston.
$1 million? That's a joke, right? Why would anyone buy this mediocre car? I'd get a Bentley Continental GT or even an Audi RS6 any day!
This cars longer than my house 0-0
It hit me that you should have dressed up have some respect for the car 😏
It's just a Lincoln  in the outside and a genesis in the inside. Fuck that
Now how will I ever know how the  reverse light looks like in the world's most expensive saloon
It looks like Kia and dodge challenger had a boy....
I can give you no more than 100k if you want for this thing. British cars are strange. When you buy a Jaguar with steering wheel on the left, you pay 150k, on the right side 75k. A lot of tax!
Doug in 2020 : This is a 2020 Aston Martin lagonda 🚗 Doug in 2050 : This is a 2050 Aston Martin Lagonda airpod 🛸
Aston Martin designers: "How much should we sell the new Lagonda Taraf for?" Aston Martin marketing: "OnE mIlLiOn DoLlArS" designers: "Are you sure? Isn't that more than it's worth?" marketing: "YAS!!!" designers: "Seriously, are you joking, or will that be the actual price?" marketing: "YAS!!! WE SERIOUS! ARAB PRINCE WILL PAY ANYTHING FOR CAR IF IT'S 'EXCLUSIVE' ENOUGH!!!"  executives: "Alright, case closed, sell it for $1M!"
"most beautiful 4 door car" ummmm Have you seen the rear end???
lol, looks like a Honda Accord from the front, beautiful but one has to be insane. BTW, you have to pay for your own iPads
This it’s genuinely unacceptable from a $200k car even from 2018, for a million dollars... wtf Aston?
Wow what a big disappointment..
il stick with a Rolls Royce, thanks.
“Diiiiiisszzzzzz!” Is the *insert any object here w/ a hilarious description*
Looks like if a Honda Odyssey were a car.
Million bucks , sold in middle east yet heated seats available and no massage and ventilation seats. Aston martin going places 😂
i’m actually arabic and taraf means mercy in arabic
This car ain’t worth 1 mil cause theres no turn signals on the mirrors 🤣🤣
When will they make headlines that look like Kylo Ren's light saber?
Only luxury thing about this ugly car is the price tag. Worst looking interior i've seen for a long time.
The front definitely looks like the honda accord with ashton martin badge
Not worth $400,000, it’s like a Bentley not a private jet.
The front is a Ford fusion lol
I find absolutely nothing special about this car it looks like every other Aston Martin which are very nice however not $1 million nice I'd rather buy myself a Rolls-Royce or Bentley or even better yet for that price a Rolls-Royce and a Ferrari boy they really saw those guys come in when they saw this
Cars and Bids sounds great for sellers, but super shitty for buyers 🤷‍♂️ why would you ever want to pay the most for something?
That is one of the worst Aston Martin cars for a million dollars.. and Doug you're not being honest with your review
turath means this car represent the history of the company in arabic not like he said it repesent luxury
1 million dollar car and you dont get a panoramic roof. fail
"Would you look at that ? Just look at it !"  *Doug looks at it for many minutes
Hi everyone is saying this car is ugly! I just want to remind you:   1) Beaty is in the eye of the beholder and as Doug I really think this car is drop dead gorgeous. 2) As Doug I like understated cars, and as an understates car this is the most beautiful, it's not showy but does not look bland in any way. If you have a Lambo everyone will look at it, if you have this only car guys will notice.   Is it and overpriced Rapids? To some extent, undoubtedly.   But as a Rapide looks and overgrown DB9, this is a thing of it's own. From the far it may look unoriginal and bland but more you get near more its concealed muscles will became evident and more the lines will look stunning, thanks to a multitude of surfaces on the body that gives it more detail. A Rapide is gonna look old in the next 20 years, it is not as times less as this or a DB9, which is similar but better proportioned.
wait 2 more years you get it for 200k
تَرَفْ ~♡
....So a 1$M Ford, interesting
What an absolute waste of money
This car does not seem like it should be 1 million dollars at all. Come on, Aston, Ford Focus signal stalks for 1.2 million and a Garmin navigation? It honestly doesn’t look that good in my opinion either, the front looks exactly like a Mazda and the rear reminds me of  a Continental. The Phantom has more horsepower, more umbrellas, it costs half, and it has automatic doors/soft close doors. And the rims are very boring, I saw a Dodge Journey with rims just like those and that’s a $23k crapbox.
Rostest (Ростест) logo on the key! Да ладно!
Ah, making luxury cars for evil monarchs for whom slavery is no crime.
When you flexin with your Aston Martin umbrela and then a guy with Lagonda umbrela shows up
I wouldn’t even buy it for 60k x)
Nope.
i always wonder, is there someone with him while he is recording all of these? or do the dealers just trust him by himself
So this is like an equus? But like not as nice?
The front looks like a Ford i will pass
Simply beautiful. Simply OVERPRICED
Rather have a late '90s Jag XJ or 2000 7 Series for design.
Don’t know how Doug can say this is the best looking 4 door on earth, other than I am sure he had to say that to get to review it.
What a disgrace is Ford. They took a wonderful car and made a Mondeo out of it..
l o n g  a c c o r d
Daily score 28 out of 50 for a luxury 4 dor sedan that cost 1.000.000 $ .... of course my horse...
I love that color. Very unique!
STOP embarrassing yourself boy, that thing, to start with....looks 'Shit' 🤣🤣
If a ford fusion fused with an i8
Doug; I propose two new categories. How many looks you get from boomers and how many you get from chicks. A cool mill should give you 10 in both.
No wonder no one buys. Looks like a Ford Fusion
Range Rover sport next?
I'm just excited that we're going to get a Lambo Centenario vid soon
I can see why it’s not sold in the US...
Looks like a 2000 Cadillac STS up front and sides and a Dodge dart in the back.  The interior is very underwhelming for a car in that price. Look at a Pagani zonda or Bugatti interior it's not even close.
There is more luxury in a $100k BMW 7 series.
This is garbage for the price.
Why does he talk about this car, as if it was released a few decades ago? He uses "at the time/ what Aston Martin had at the time" or "same as other cars of that era" , when this was released in 2018?
Doug if aston martin is holding u hostage just wink three times with left eye
Aston martin, Land Rover, and Jaguar are basically Indian owned but have Ford Part's
0:00 0:11 0:21 0:34  if u didn’t get it it said this the worlds twice as expensive as doug.
It’s not worth the million dollars in my opinion 🥱 but nice vid 👍
I want that centenario review
Ain’t no money like oil money 💴
I think the S90 volvo is the best looking sedan
This car, but all electric, without outdated internal computers/screens, and alcantera interior.
😂😂😂
I feel like the Lagonda from the 70s and 80s is more desirable.
Doug lies
my  man Doug casually sitting in a million dollar car in his "high school fat kid" outfit
Thiiiiiiissssss is by no means the most expensive or luxurious car! Can’t be a million bucks..... Aston Martin wakanda!!!!!
Oh my god, is that Centenario coming soon?
Where is the blue centinario review
It really isn't thaaat beautiful
The Aston Martin Fusion
Ugh no, I’ll take a Mercedes Benz  Cabriolet or Rolls Royce Phantom. F*ck that car.
I don't know what a million dollar interior looks like....but this ain't it.
lugani garbage
when you reed those comments you know why they don’t sold this car in the US, the americans don’t understand this car and the value
The anteater is reborn.
Funny, an engine with an ASTON MARTIN brand, final inspected by  LAGONDA and built by FORD in Cologne, Germany :-D
looks like shit, you get better luxury from a 30 year old lexus
The front reminds me of a Mazda 3
A Mil and no sun roof done it for me. May sound petty but if you spend a mil, it should have every extra you can think of.
Taraf as in... taraf de haidouks? A car for gypsies?
It looks like a.... A Lagonda! Because you know... that’s what the styling is actually based off of. The one from the 1970’s and 80’s. This car is a stunner but yes, that money is entirely for the exclusivity.
If this was a Honda he would call it ugly
Like my brother says: "If I had a million dollars, I would have bought Daewoo Matiz and a mansion with pool, blackjack and hookers".
3:41 yeah, because its design is SIMPLE.
looks like a 4 door Challenger..
My Flying Spur is more luxurious, more comfortable and faster than this and I paid 75k for it!
Looks like a fucking kia stinger and honda accord 😂
i get HONDA ACCORD vibes😐
If you remove the side windows, the roof, the a, b, and c pillars, the wheels and left just the front windshield, this could almost pass off as a luxury boat.
What is the odd ping that occurs when turning right? Maybe I am just imagining it, but midway of every right turn I hear an odd noise.
It looks like a concept challenger
That color!!!😍
Kia is working on a more affordable option... 🤔
Very similar to the Mazda Vision Coupe
Hey Doug I think you should do a review on the Tesla model s the p85d is insanely fast and It might make a good review
The ford turn signal switches, rapide steering wheel and switch gear,  and garmin nav are absolutely unforgiveable in a million dolar ultra-luxury sedan. Literally shouted “Oh come on!!!” out loud in public at an outdoor restaurant   when the nav issue came up. Unbelievable.
It looks like a car from GTA - just a weird mishmash of other cars
These rims look like cheap aftermarket rims.
Best I can do is $60K
I’d Rather Have A Rolls Royce for that price and Buy 2
Car looks like an ABOMINATION. Doug is a joke. Such a dishonest review.
Looks like a cleaner Volvo S90
Where Doug gets this Cars now?
The umbrella is useful in the UK, maybe in the middle east as a sunshade.
Let’s talk depreciation... does it???
At least the name of my deawoo laganza is similar to this otherwise the deawoo is far better
Looks like an accord
Does it look good ? Yes. Do I think it worth 1M ? No.     Do I have 1M ? (No...)
Absolute garbage for the price
This Looks Like A Long Ass Maserati Ghibli 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
ugly car
Saab 900 Turbo for review!
looks like the null car from forza.... definitely not breathtaking-ly gorgeous, but not ugly
That CarsAndBids Lambo Is gorgeous. I have to stop watching Doug and get to work to earn enough money to afford it 😂
The interior is disappointing for this price. It's an Aston (sorry, Lagonda), so I wouldn't expect Pagani-type flash, but perhaps some variety of texture and colour? And, at this price, couldn't a deal have been struck with Apple to produce one of its beautifully tactile and ergonomic devices for nav and sounds?
As if Aston Martin wasn't fancy enough already
What a ridiculous car, I can't believe they got anyone to pay that much for it when they could have had a Rolls Royce for half the price. And sorry Doug, but I don't think it's all that pretty either.
Aston Martin.. the poor mans Ferrari 😂
I feel this review without Doug's spark, looks like a tv commercial instead of a real review.
This interior is so old !
Im i the only one that thought that the door handles will automatically come up?
Looks like a Ford Fusion from the front end
You're paying for the styling???!! It looks like a 2006 " era " mid-tier sedan. Doug is a joke. Imagine how much he got paid to say that
Ford Fusion, accord and Taurus had a baby... an expensive one.  With the back end of a 2011 Saab 9-5  👍🏼
Why buy this when a rolls would be so much better
What a joke. Well the last idiot with to much money is not born yet
I'd love to see Scotty Kilmer review this car.
If Honda ever wanted  to make an electric car accord . This what the accord would look like
Front end reminds me of the Volkswagen Arteon.
Wow!
Does the new car smell remind you of Trump brand fragrance?
looking fresh doug.
I would willingly indulge myself into a pyramid scheme twice before I even think about dumping a million on this thing.
Not that color though.
Ugliest sedan ever!! You dont have to lie to get those car for free
THISSS is a $1 Million dollar pile of human excrement
Nice car but not worth close to a million
IN THIS MOMENT THE DOUG DEMURO PREVIOUS NISSAN S-CARGO IS SELLING IN CARS AND BIDS! OMG
For me the Fisker Karma still takes home the best looking sedan award.
Idk...looks like a challanger and a lada from the side and with an unfinished front and end. Aston makes beautiful cars usually, but this looks like a cheap rip-off. For this moni, Pagani, ty.
My 2020 Civic has a sunroof. This $1,000,000 sedan does not. Hmm.
Love the Taraf too. One of the reasons it's a $1m even though it's based on the old VH architecture much like the Rapide, is the fact the Taraf has a full carbon fibre body. I believe it's the only four door saloon in the world to have one.
Cars of this era? He said it’s a 2018. That’s 2 years ago
I called it on doug's last video when he showed this on his cars and bids ad! it has dodge challenger vibes on the rear quarter panel  also "aston martin" seen in the garmin navigation screen menu. also weird not to see a sunroof or something on this car.
"cars from this era" it's two years old 😖
THIS car is ridiculous at this price point. My 2012 EQUUS (Thanks Doug for the reviewing this car is why I bought it) has nearly everything if not more stuff and it only cost me 12k .
The value should be no higher than 3. Exclusivity be damned, this car is not worth 1 million dollars at all.
I’d pick the rapide over this
So much integrity lost in one video Doug. I hope it was worth it.
Uhhhhh this is OVERKILL like seriously you can get a non depreciating Bugatti veyron from CNC motors.
Looks like a glorified ford fusion
This car belongs in a game under the brand Dewbauchee. That would justify its bonkers price: that game even has reused interiors.   It's GTA Online btw
"So what is a Lagonda? Well, this is Astin Martin's "luxery" brand"  The luxury brand has a luxery brand.
Looks like a bmw i8 👌🏽
The centanario👀👀👀
Such a stupid way to blow a million bucks, but more power to them I guess?
All cars should have "swan" doors.
Wheels look like they're from Town Fair Tire.
It's a no for me..
I happened to think this shit is ugly
Doug thinks this car is beautiful..?? It's pretty bland looking in styling.. Very disproportionate too.
Please...just... buy a Rolls Royce
1 mill for a car that you need to install your own rear screams..... This car sucks
This is like what Hyundai did with the Genesis
1 Million dollars and there aren’t even rear cooled seats?
Let them estimate for 3 million who cares 😂
Why does it have Dodge Charger wheels?
Beautiful? Hell nawwwww
I always wondered why all the luxurious cars have a plastic and cheap seat buckle, now I know why thanks to you haha
Can’t say i like this car in any form
front looks like honda accord
I am so incredibly torn on the headlights. I both love and loath them.
Doug, the word you're looking for is "exclusivity".
Doug the type of guy to review a $1 million car with a serious case of bed-head.  I love it.
For 1 mill? 😂😂😂😂
1 million dollars and you get the cheapest iPad's... not even the Pro version
5:23 "as a lot of cars from this era did" bruh, this car's from 2018, two years ago. Also, the taillight changing to orange for the turn signal isn't new, I've seen it on other cars for a few years now... Also, the grille and headlights looks like Trump with his mouth open and his eyes squinted.  Another thing that really annoyed me. Look at 19:07 on the little screen showing "KM/H", you can see on the right edge of the screen what looks like a cut off "A". Nice attention to detail, Aston Martin... Also who still used those pixel screens in 2018 and considered themselves a "luxury" car? My dad's old car from 1999 had the same style of screen in it. Also, the Garmin screen is laughable being used in that kind of car.  Edit: What was that "clank" noise @ 24:16? That didn't sound like a million-dollar car to me.
4:07 looks like a ford fusion from front
I was pissed off when they released this car for $1M. Like? Wtf. Great review though Doug!
i live in Dubai. But i`ve never seen this beauty on the road :(
Dude pays a million. Gets a pretty glum Garmin GPS screen up front, and Glum rear climate controls, that do not display the actual temperature, only a silly thermometer that can go up or down.  Sounds about right. Well done, old chap! Too busy stitching that leather...to go find better touchscreen designs for a 2018.
Grill be like 👁👄👁
Now I can’t wait for the centenario review
Thisssssssssss is Doug trying to be objective and miserably failing at it.
Hyundai Genesis front grill....
I'm pretty sure this car was imported under the "Show or Display" Exemption. I saw a V12 Zagato here in the U.S. and that was imported under Show or Display
Is that a key 🔑 hole 🕳 next to the handles on front doors?
People commenting "too expensive, lack of features etc" from an iPhone that costs 1300$ be like "yeah i'm too smart to throw away my money like that". It's just like your iPhone, it's not worth the whole cost but you buy it because of the exclusivity, not for the value to cost ratio
Kinda shocked it doesn’t have ventilated seats for the hot Middle East or even perforated leather
I'd rather have a lincoln continental for 1/20th the price and 80% of the car, if not more
I bet the designer only had a ruler and a pencil available while sketching this
the interior is EXACTLY like standard Aston Martin, they didn't change a dam thing
Doug is a type of guy to spread out in a million dollar car
Basically the S63 AMG for around 100 000$ blows this car out of water in every single aspect. This car is not worth more than 50 000$
I’m trying really hard to be impressed but for a million?🤷🏾‍♂️😂
Best looking ? Beautiful ?  Go and have a quiet word with yourself Douglas, it is badly proportioned and that rear three quarter doesnt know if it wants to be boxy or curvy so it does both/neither, confused and unresolved. Blinded by the price sunshine.
I would be embarrassed to drive this car underneath everything it a FORD👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Sorry, but this is ridicoously overpriced. It lacks a lot of features, no infotainment system, nothing that would justify even a 200k price tag. Buying something only because it's rare and paying a million is just stupid. I can understand even those who buy a Phantom. It costs a lot, but it offers a lot, it's not only luxurious, it's also fun to drive and be driven around in. And I can have it for half the money.
This thing looks like a 2017+ Ford Fusion and that upsets me.
I honestly thought I was the only American who knew this car 😂
0:40 what kind of lambo is that?
"Why is it called the Laganda Taraf, and how IS IT HERE" hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Im sorry but id rather buy a phantom and an aventador. So I have a super car and a luxury car, instead of one car trying to do both.
Ugly and the technology in the interior is a joke for the price - „Ford Taurus“ #wtf
The Ford Taurus front end and hideous matte paint ruin it for me. Compare this to a DBS, DB9, or Rapide and it looks ridiculous. I also love the fact that the interior is just a retrimmed decade-old Rapide interior
"Its very rainy in the UK" this is undoubtedly true.  However the car was built for the middle east, where it is not!
Not that great looking in fact its taraful.
in romania, taraf means gipsy music band
One million dollars for a sedan with no sunroof and a weird ass gear shifter and looks like an accord? really.
This is just a borimg car  I domt see why u hype.it so much  Even the new genesis are more beautiful.then thiz
This is the only sedan with a full carbon fiber body
The tar(i)f is ugly and and expensive
$1M Lagonda . . .you close the trunk . . .$98,000 Mercedes . . .press a button and it closes for you . . .luxury ;)
This thing looks like a redesigned Chrysler 300
Over $1mil for a sedan that doesn't even have cooled rear seats and has an ancient Garmin. Let's be clear that Garmin was ancient when this car was new.
What? They actually tried to ressurrect that monstrosity?!
AN LCD SCREEN AT 17:53 💀💀💀 awesome they let you review this though
new dodge challenger? hahahahaha
"It's so beautiful." Why didn't they finish painting it?
Thank you for the experience! Definitely the most beautiful 4 door sedan I have ever seen on video.
I think the comments have already massacred this car enough but still this isn't worth one third of a phantom let alone double the price
Wow. 1 million USD for a car inferior to the S class?
Good luck getting rid of that car, even in LA.
I was working at Aston Martin when they had just started production. Stunning and massive in person
This thing should be worth 100k
Aston martins always been overpriced.
You didn't mention that keyhole that is stuck there like on a Dacia Sandero door.
Not beautiful, but at least expensive 😂😂😂
Looks like a bigger Dart to me
I watched this whole video and I still can't see why this car selling for 1M. I've sene better cars for a fraction of the price.
I wouldn't pay 30k for this POS
Ok maybe $300,000 but that car isn’t worth $1 million, and Doug needs some knee pads! He is on them constantly
6:55 there's a little arrow to tell you which side of the car is up. How luxurious
1 million dollar car. ford focus turn signal and garmin nav.   headlights look like a honda accord  ill pass
Doug's giving this car a tongue bath for its looks, and all I can think is  for a million dollars, it looks pretty boring
Never new about this car, but if only 20 were made, that's probably why. Looks dope though.
My name is Kyle and when I score things I give them the Kyle score!!
Nice Accord
Honestly a vw arteon gets my motor going more than this. Unpopular opinion  perhaps, nothing more than what it is. Something about it's design language doesn't add up imo. Maybe it's a case of "you need to get use to the design language"  Nonetheless, I don't see it growing on me to the point of 1m diamonds and dollas
Looks like a stretched out Saab 9-5 except less tasteful
For a million dollars, there should be ZERO amounts of plastic in here. Also, if it hasn't been mentioned before, it looks like a ford Taurus head on, from the front. It's pretty, but more for like 200 grand at the most, not a million. Just my opinion.
Beautiful? How much is the dealership paying you Doug?!
@12:20: ....and this piece doubles as a window knocker for those who forget to push it back against the magnet. Every time you hit a bump it taps against the glass to remind you why you paid a million for a sedan....bump, ding!, bump, ding! Little Johnie will be back there...tap...tap tap....tap tap tap.....Very entertaining.
“Todayuh I’m going to reviewuh..,”
I thought it was a Maserati at first glance.
I don't know, this looks like it could be a Hyundai Genesis or something along those lines. I was hoping it would at least have a steering wheel reminiscent of the ones in old Lagondas, but nope. Nothing very interesting here. Who paid a million dollars for this?
Its a shame that Lamborghini never put the Estoque into production..That looked stunning!
Thanks Doug.
Looks like if a 2020 ford fusion and a 2020 Lincoln continental had a fat ass cute baby. But like 5 years later
Not a million dollars.. But i dont get why people hate it so fucking much
I would rather get a Mercedes S63 and G63, and a 911 Turbo S. I would have about 400k left so maybe a 36ft center console with triple 425hp racing engines.
That Lagonda didn't look like 1 million dolar car. looks like regular fancy sedan.
If that interior doesn't make you say "Holly Cow", I don't know what amount of leather would do 🐂🐄🐃
“Taraf” in Arabic language means heritage. It’s pronounced: Turaa-th.
Looks like a car you’d see in gta
luxury cars don't look good matt black, period.
Taraf is an Arabic word ترف Means luxury and richness So no wonder this is middle east exclusive
This made me feel broke in at least 38 different ways
This is like Supreme but for cars...
Let me spend a mile for a garmen nav and ford blinkers with Honda accord front
Never understood the appeal of Aston Martins. Sure they’ve produced some pretty cars over the decades but im sure i can find a competitor or to wich was better, more interesting, faster and more reliable.
fun fact: the punched holes in the leather is called broguing.
I think for a million dollar I would rather buy two Rolls Royce Cullinan including taxes and shipping
Looks like they put the new Accord and the Taurus together to make this. I don't get why this is beautiful. It looks ok. 1million is a joke. Why would anyone spend that? Wow leather and a fridge! :D
Great can't wait for hoovies garage to buy this lol
Centenario vid on the way too hell yeah
Is this car a joke? Wtf 1m$ USD?!?!? Wrinkly headliner, shitty infotainment, outdated dashboard, bland generic exterior, no sunroof,  etc... I'd pay 50-60k for that.
You people look so dull to me. You think the price of a car (or any object) only depends on features you get. You can only see your own point of view. It depends on how much it costs to develop and produce. And making few cars means splitting development costs among few buyers. This has custom coach-building (extremely expensive), leather (also) and probably hundreds of tiny custom parts. ...and people who really wanted this and have the money will pay that price because this is rare and beautiful and desirable. I wouldn't be surprised if Aston would have lost money if they sold this for $900K.
I love this car DAMN
It’s back!
That Centenario was Sick !! Hoping for a video with it .
Am i the only one thinking that it's not that good looking?
By the time no one buys this, you will see it depreciate faster than a rollercoaster powered with jet engines.
That Centenario has me excited
That turn signal stalk is just an insult to any buyer....even a 95 Lincoln Town Car chrome turn signal stalk looks 10x better. They could have just used that....it is also a Ford part.
This looks like something honda would make if they made a fully electric Honda Accord
Looks like a car from the movie In time
It’s a really good looking car; however, I don’t believe that it is worth $1,000,000, but rather around $450,000.
1 million lmao...
1 million dollars? For that crap? I'll take the Rolls-Royce Phantom all day any day
I was in London at the same time as you Doug last summer around end July. I remember because you posted images of cars you saw on the streets whilst I was there!
This makes the Rolls Royce Phantom look like the bargain of the century.
Car interior is garbage. An s class is so much nicer and is 10 times less.
This reminds me of that app when the iPhone first came out that cost $1000 and only showed a jewel on the screen.   Aston Martin figured out the very wealthy will buy anything just to show their neighbor they can afford it, regardless of its actual worth. You can’t buy equanimity though.
Could u time 0-60 with special timing gear (if possible) cause I feel like u sometimes gloss over it and take the manufacturer's word which is often untrue
They could’ve at least hid the keyhole on the door FoR A MiLlIoN doLLaR CaR
No adaptive cruise, a Garmin nav, and iPad mini’s in the headrests: just tell a rich person “this is 1/100”, they’ll pay a million for it lol.  Exclusivity: the greatest ripoff ever created.  Smart marketing on Aston’s part tho!
Front reminds me of a Honda Accord from this era
Kinda looks like a boring BMW i8 sedan to me,at least in the front
This looks to much like a gta v car
meh, the old Lagonda with the CRT screens is more exciting
One day, someone will tell Doug that the kilometer per hour abreviation is kmh and not kph.
for that price, for middle east market optional equipment must include two blonde prostitutes and a black lion.
Not my taste ,in my opinion it s just ugly
Looks like a 2020 accord lmaooooo
Looks like a lot car based on a charger
i like the front. Its beautifull!
looks like a rapide, you can pick one up for under 60k
Turn heads? If i seen it in driveway I would think is just a lexus
In 5 years “This is a Aston Martin Lagonda, and it is a true luxury used car bargain.
I would take a Genesis G90 (2021) over this
Yikes, the comments do NOT like this car
It just shows you there are 120 idiots who will spend $1million on a car worth $150K
i think its the ugliest car i ever seen although the rear end is ok i guess.
Well Doug you forgot to mention "Sponsored" in the title. This car ain't a 1 Million$ luxury
It just looks like a genesis
6:45 the front kinda reminds me of the current generation VW Jetta. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Front looks like a Taurus, rear looks like a Charger: disguised for a Cannonball right from the factory!
headlight integrated with front grill remind me of Fiat Tipo
Million dollar garbage. Doug dropped the ball on this one
The front lights look like a bmw i8
your comfort and quality scores are not objective
That car looks like a Hyundai Genesis. Ugly 1 million
Is it only me who think this car is not worth a million bucks??? 🤔🤔🤔
As the saying goes "A fool and his money are soon parted".
Am i the only one that really doesnt find this car that pretty? Honestly it looks pretty bland to me
Interior so big it tight for him..the door dosent move meanwhile it looked loose ..so extra this guy
iPads and USB Charge ports are apparently only for children according to Doug. Lol
Everyone is talking about how crappy the Lagonda is, but literally nobody is talking about the Centenario Roadster that Doug had for his cars and bids ad
At least the Lagondo kept to tradition in being the most overpriced, least appealing car on the planet. At least the old Lagonda had some cutting edge electronics for its time....This one is even worse.
unaint gonna park this car next to another car so the door feature is very useless
people buy maybachs or rolls royces for luxury and making a statement but this lagonda is the mother of all statements to car collectors!
Sweet whistling Geronimo...$1 million for this piece of crap
Looks like a Ford fusion from the front, Lincoln mkz from the back
This is "A Mobile Peice of Art"! 🤤
"This seats have IPads so your children won't be bored wile you are driving Along"  If I would be a child, I bet I wouldn't be bored sitting in the back of a Lagonda.
Absolute pure shit. S class is far far better. Limited number doesn't make it special, I can poop and my poop is unique in shape, does not make it a one million dollar poop cause it a unique turd
He talks like my old biology professor
The only things that make this special is the limited run production and the price. NOTHING justifies this price tage for a bit meaner looking Rapide. I wouldn't pay a penny more for it than a Rapide, which is more beautiful to me anyway. I'd seriously choose the old Lagonda instead, which had true quirks and features, not like this one, and a much more unique look.
How on earth would u compare the luxury of dis steroid Ford to a Rolls royce or s class...like really..
I would'nt even pay 200000 for this
That car is ugly
wow getting your hands on a 1/120 car is pretty exclusive! Doug's made it!
Now I can say of which car Doug's preparing the very next video just if I see the ad of CarsAndBids into a previous one. ))))
Million dollars and you didn’t get tinted windows 😆
When your born into a family that has too much money from oil, this is the car you get.
This is a beautiful car, but no way is it worth a $1M.
Hhhhmm... $1 million buys me TWO gorgeous and fully optioned Rolls Royces....... Or, one absolutely hideous tacky Aston Martin. Tough choice!
Build for one purpose: to steal oil money.
1 million dollars. No ventilated seats and no back seats monitors. Lol.
I'd rather take an Audi S8. I just dont see anything special about that car besides its value due to rarity. It ain't even that pretty, it's so bland.
I don't see a million dollars here.
Lol... Trunk is not even electric
Ha Dingle around
You should review a One-77 if you get the chance
7:25 but it's a chrystler badge
Why does it look like someone slapped Honda Accord headlights on a rolls?!?
Come on a million dollar car with 40k rapid interior !!!! Aston martin doesn’t respect buyers 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
1 million dollars for that, no thank you!
Doug is the type of dude to say, " i spent minutes looking at it".
The fridge looks like ist liftet straight out a Mercedes S-Class. Also ist just incredibly overpriced...
That is the ugliest Mazda mx6 I have ever seen.
I'd be surprised if it cost more than 100k to make
So basically a Charger and a Mazda3 had a kid.....
imagine you driving your phantom and someone pulled up next to you with their lagonda taraf
The gauge cluster looks outdated
Wait, It's  a 2018 and Doug kept saying "This is the technology they had at the time?" My 2018 RAM has a nicer screen!
The Aston Martin $1,000,000 idea
Rockstar should add this car in gta online
This was a naked cash grab in the "ridiculously rich arab sultan" market
As he says, it's a very handsome car. 2 things ruin this particular one imo, matte black? (or grey or whatever it is) Come on, it's not a hotrod, and all clear glass.
i'll happily turn down the kool aid here
Is this called overpriced? Because it is really unfair to say that for the other overpriced cars!
It looks just like hoovies $30,000 rapide which itself looks like a Ford Fusion
Is this a GTA Online car? The price is about right
If he said that THIS is 2021 Ford Fusion for 50k, id believe him.
Looks like a GTA V car
Thank you daddy Doug for always showing beautiful automobiles!!
How the hell is this a 2018 luxury car? It has the same interior functionality of a 2008 Lexus IS. It's 10 years outdated the day it was built. I guess for the Saudi price who is only going to park it in his collection until he dies it doesn't matter.
This car is so "beautiful" that you may think its design was made with the right hand by a left-hand-child.. seriously, it is UGLY AF!!!
The type of button for cooling the compartment in the back looks like it´s the same mercedes is or better was using in some of their cars :)
This car is not worth a million dollars.
Nobody:  Daddy Doug: THIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS.....
Looks like говно
It probably wasn't sold in north-america because it just wouldn't sell; or worse, the press would praise it for the beautiful design but laugh at it for the ridiculous asking price.
If this unpainted  Aston Martin appeals to you - just go get a late year DB9 or Rapide for about 60-75 K.   Save you $925 K.   And then you can go to your local chop shop to primer it for you.
Damn this car is ugly lol. That was my first thought when this video started.
WOW. That's the most beautiful car I've seen in a very long time.
This not worth more the 80k
The car looks pretty cheap, like some new KIA thats made for american markets and is bigger than regular :D  The rear is copied from a dodge and front is like a Honda NSX
It is hideous in my opinion!
Doug, were you high when you were reviewing this ????
Regular Doug Any overpriced car maker : slap some logo on any weird place in the car Doug : look at this beautiful magnificent godlike coolness of this godlike car
I think it’s ugly.
Model 3 has similar glass between the two door glass pieces. No plastic. And similar door handles too like many Aston Martins
Not even wireless charging
For me I only liked the seats and the engine because it’s not covered with plastic and I’d buy an s63 amg over it
They paid him to say how nice it is
Whats the clunking noise everytime you make right turn? LOL
If this car is in a snowy climate will the door handles open when they get icy. Sometimes my fuel door is  iced over
27:43 Doug just trolled us all
Its ok looking..
This cars insurance can buy a few of what I drive
If Batman had a grand dad this is what he would drive.
Looks like a 2013 Ford Taurus
Listen, this car is ugly.  Plain and simple.  The designer totally dropped the ball with the hard angle in the rear doors...it's like a throwback to that 80's Laganda you reviewed, too boxy and angular....except this one is flowy and beautiful in the front and back, but that angle in the top corner of the rear doors makes it look TERRIBLE.  If that line flowed into the back windshield and trunk, 100% I'd agree with you... but unfortunately the car is rubish with that angle there.
seems overdone with leather
I mean it’s certainly nice and made with quality but my 2012 Jeep GC overland has more luxury features. Minus the swan hinge doors
car looks absolutely boring and a huge waste of money. Terrible review
I don't know about beautiful, but this car looks clean and resembles the old Lagonda. Plus this is just Doug's opinion about the car, not a commandment or a rule. It's just his opinion. But 10/10, nah this ain't worth it. Its more like maybe a 6/7 out of 10 to me. Also, why couldn't Aston Martin spend a little to cover up that refrigerator setup
XXXL Ford Fusion
I can get a rolls royce  a ferrari and a range rover with money to spare. Shear beauty i hate the looks.1 million dollars and 100,000 in repairs in the next 3 years
The front looks like the 2018 Honda Accord
@3:55...looks like a Honda Accord at the front end
I have 6.
Doug Talking about the best looking sedan he’s ever seen! Wtf!! 😂😂looks like an anteater
This car has the ugliest steering wheel in the world 🌎
2015 Mercedes benz s class and  at all levels and 2015 BMW 7 series  are more luxurious and have better build quality and more modern technology
Looks like a honda accord
Although Lagonda is an English marque, it's founder, Wilbur Gunn was from Springfield, Ohio and named named the company after a Shawnee settlement near to his birthplace.
I still think the phantom is a way better value
This car isn't worth 1M dollars. Seriously. The Phantom is a better value for money and honestly is more luxurious than this car. I'll agree this looks better though.
The maybach landaulet is around 1.4 mil
I prefer the Rapide. The design is much more elegant, and classic Aston Martin.  For only 6% the price of this thing!!  You could literally buy 17 Rapides for $1,000,000
What is that weird noise on 24:16 ? Wery beautiful car thow
I’m sorry Doug, I’ve got to disagree with you. Exterior-wise, this is not the most beautiful 4 door sedan by any stretch. I’ve usually agreed with you in the past but not this time. This car is very ugly to put it bluntly. The front reminds me of a 2015 Ford Taurus and I’m getting a 2019 Lincoln Continental vibe around the fender/front door area. The rear end is horrendous as well. You are trippin’! Like if you agree...
Yeah the back seat climate control is a joke. Spending a million on a car, it should something  be more unique to that car rather then a parts bin. Too many times Aston Martin tries to be luxury, but fails
Most hated 1 million dollar car  I have ever seen.
This car will depreciate 10000 dollars every day.
As a luxury saloon, that's not a patch on the Phantom.
Review audi s8 d2 please
it looks like a genesis that aston martin spent an additional 5k on, also doug why are you complementing simple 2017 features on a million dollar car
I’m Doug Demero and Thisssss is the Cheapest looking Million Dollar Car in the World Solely built to Scam middle-easterners into buying a “Luxury” Chrysler 200/any Cadillac sedan hybrid,when they could just buy a fully optioned out Rolls Royce.
OMG that's a Centenario in the beginning ,i hope the review is close man.
Looks like a stretched out Galant. No thanks 😂
I usually agree with doug on styling but not this.. I understand looks/styling is subjective but to me it's not impressive.. doesn't look great, or even good. Personally love Aston Martin looks but this looks mehhh.
You could buy 50 Certified pre owned 2011 V8 Vantages with only 10k miles FOR THE SAME COST of this ugly duckling.   In my eyes, it is not a classic Aston.
why does it look like a gta version of a mazda 4
gush much ? "this aston martins luxury brands" ??? uhhh isnt aston a luxury brand? confused. this car is totally overpriced.
Imagine if this was a japanese car🤨 Doug would've criticized it soooo much that the manufacturer would be crying😂 Yeah, he's biased
Only imbeciles bought this million dollars Aston Martin RAPID changed to Lagonda 😒 its not worth it a disappointment that’s why American won’t buy them
Most expensive luxury car? RR Sweptail £14m Maybach S £6.5m
Low-key looks like a long ass hellcat
Looks like a Genesis concept car of 2005.
I am just pissed looking at this vehicle being a million dollars and doesn’t even provide as much compared to genesis g80
THE perfect complement to the $95,000 pickup Doug reviewed recently. Clearly there is a global moron market.
The front reminds me of a late model Ford Taurus. Can't unsee that.  EDIT - wrote this comment before mentioned a Ford Taurus. Odd ..
Looks like a Maserati quattroporte from 15 years ago with a Ford Taurus front end.
Also Doug you said Lagonda a million times, anyone here knows about Lagonda otherwise we wouldn’t be watching your videos and be such car enthusiasts 😁
doesn't even have tinted windows lol
Give me some reasons why this car cost 10 times the lexus LS
imagine paying a million dollors for good leather seats
The German Car Review channel called Autogefühl would have a fit over the amount of leather used in this car. Good channel however they bring their vegan lifestyle into the reviews of cars. IMHO opinion the car is too boxy for my liking.
6:20 and very audi
Gorgeous my ass🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️. Looks like a cheep correan sedan. A combination between Kia and Genessis. The C pillar is copied from Rolls Royce. Inside is just a Aston Martin Rapide whit a Lagonda name and 5 time the prince. P.S. Doug, i wonder how much money did the dealership who has this overpriced Rapide paid you to say that is gorgeous and you pay the rarity🙈, trying to get someone to buy it. I would have a Rolls Royce alllllll day instead of this and plenty of money remaining to buy a Rapide as well !!!😂😂😂
0:37 Jeez I wasn't expecting to see a beautiful Centanario after a sheap a** animation ahah
When are we getting a centenario review
Looks pretty basic honestly
The taillights are breathtaking! Beautiful 😍
MKBHD here for that matte black aesthetic?👀
This car is overpriced overpriced.
I would never think that this is a million dollar car, something like a Mercedes looks much better and more luxurious to me.
It looks like ford Fusion/Mondeo
This car is a million dollar Genesis G90
I never thought you would review the Lagonda. This car is absolutely gorgeous
“Middle East = suckers”         - Aston Martin
I’ve been waiting for Doug to review this car since it came out,finally he has done it😍
RR is better
And here I thought Lexus navigation system was bad for 70-100k cars!
Thank you but I’d rather have a fully loaded M760i for 1/5 the price.
There may be a next car on the test drive in a commercial of CarsAndBids.com (Lamborghini Centenario roadster will appear in a few videos).
To me the rapide looks better. Lagonda looks good, posh and interesting, but the rapide stil looks like a coupe, it can be easily mistaken for db9.
I don’t know but  this is just so ugly
Of probably a million colours option this matte black is the absolute worst. If it was vomit green or poo brown it would have been much more appropriate to this elegant car.
Must be completely different in person for this to make sense 🤔 ✌👍
It’s almost exactly the same inside than a Rapide !
What a piece of junk!
I would pay on a good day max 30.000$ for that car based on the options and styling. Forget about all that leather 🙄
Fun fact: while the Rolls Royce hood ornament is called "The Spirit of Ecstasy", the Lagonda logo is called "The Logonda".
0:14 that’s a European license plate bracket...  Edit: oooooohh, it’s an import
I really wish the screenshots of cars and bids were up to date
Nothing about this vehicle screams a million dollars !!!!!!
from the side it looks like a Honda Accord 😂
I’m feeling a centeniro review is coming.
Based on the name, I figured out the intended market before Doug even had a chance to note it in the video.  Aston made it quite obvious.
Am I the only one who thinks the front end just looks like a Honda Accord with the grille and the lights?
Extended wheel base rapide for 1 million dollars...
The steering wheel, air vents, and small infotainment screen looks like it belongs in an economy car.
So, basically the cheapest object in this thing is the turn signal. 🤣
Did Aston pay you for this review? You are overly excited about this car!
"Everything is a little bit more luxurious than the Rapide" 😑 yet, it has the same steering wheel, same navigation, same climate control, same... same... 😑
Thissssss Is the most ugly and stupid expensive car I've ever seen
The car on the outside is very pretty, but the interior needs more contrast, it is all just the same color pretty much.
The Car Is Really Beautiful though...  But i Think a Dozen of Innocent Defenceless Animals have been Slaughtered to Wrap the Inside of this car..  Hmm.. Now I know why it is made only for Middle East... Because the Shaiks dont give a Damm about Beautiful Animals.....  If I became a Multi-Billionaire also in Future still I would not own this car....
All the people making jokes about this car don’t understand it, this isn’t supposed to be the best car in the world. It’s supposed to be a rare car that people that want to feel special 24/7 buy. And the Doug Score shows that, on the weekend category it did good because of how special it makes you feel, on the daily category it didnt do so good because it is not the best car in the world. If you want the most comfort, the best materials, and luxury at its finest, go get a Rolls Royce Phantom. If you want a sports sedan that is fun to drive, has awesome handling, and supercar perfomance, get a Mercedes AMG GT63 S or BMW M5. But if you want a sedan thats unique, rare, and that gives you the feeling that you are the richest man on earth, thats what the Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf exist for.
I’d so much rather have 2 rolls royce
WOOOoow I was so chocked when Doug popped up doing his ad with a centenario lol
Ford Fusion look
Most beautiful modern sedan. Period
1million.  ..... has Manuel key open gawddd kill me
Oof! People who buy this don't realize you can buy a fully equipped Rolls Royce Phantom LWB & Maybach S650 coupé with the change you got out of it, 'cept this car is armoured and has EMP protection, this car does not worth a million bucks, the S650 coupé is more beautiful and luxurious than this junk, 150k max if you ask me, and anyone foolish to buy this fancy Ford for a million bucks, well...
People are vastly missing the point of this car. Yes you can name 50 more cars that are faster, cooler looking, or have more features. But none of them will carry the prestige of this car. Absolutely none.
Imagine all the GTR's, RX-7's, and miatas you can buy with all that money.
This is the first I'm really ashamed of myself by being from Middle East.
Beautiful as it may be the front looks like a new Honda accord. I can't unsee it now.
ugliest Birkin bag put on wheels!
This car sucks lmaoo
Am I the only one who thinks the front  look like a mazda?
This car is a bigger scam than your acquaintance from college who is trying to recruit you into a pyramid scheme company 10 years later
This luxurious million dollar car is about as luxurious as a decently equiped c class
I don’t see $1million for this car...
ngl doesnt look like a million bucks
Single handedly one of the ugliest luxury Sedan I’ve ever seen
Dough: Door stays exactly where you put it, no matter where Door: Starts closing @10:02 and continues as if nobody noticed lol
No Seat cooling??
I love cars, and I love Doug, but this is disgusting. A million bucks for a car?!? There are people starving in the world.
I'd rather buy a Yugo and spend rest of the 1 million for its repair works ( lifelong )
It's the most beautiful, luxurious, most exclusive sedan in the world.I can't believe I get to drive it. Doug Score . . . . . . D. glad you aren't a teacher
The front looks so much like Honda Accord
Those panel gaps. Jeez
Fully loaded Phantom and SVJ or a modified Ford Taurus with satin black paint... tough choice really if I had $1m to splurge
I can't believe this guy has never seen indicators
thats one expensive ford fusion
*spills coffee into the stitching holes
*If someone told me this was a 15 year old used Aston for $60k, I'd believe them..*
I ain't paying that much for a car that. Looks like this
Lmao, I knew it when Doug said this is for the Middle Eastern market since Taraf literally means luxury in Arabic. So neat.
for a million it should have a modified ipad instead of a shitty infotainment
the car does look good no doubt, however this must be the most over priced car in the world,  it does not really stand out from a rapid and you'd expect for a milli yo should feel every cent of it and less of a rapid thats been decked out with leather and a different body kit. all in all not worth the money at all.
Looks like a 2019 Accord/ a Genesis sedan to me honestly.
Cmon man why don't u review the centanario, veneno, sian, Bugatti Centodeici, divo and many other exclusive cars. BTW  I love your videos
Front end looks like a Ford Fusion.
Imagine paying a million dollars and not getting a sunroof
For that amount of money, I'd buy a beautiful lake side house for around 600K in Stoney Creek, Ontario, a fully loaded Genesis GV80 ( which is way gorgeous than this car), a powerful offroad pick up Raptor and a Honda Accord for my wife as this does look like a 2019 Accord to me honestly. Still, would have money left in my account n would live a happy peaceful life.
My 2000 s600 might be more luxurious than this.
All of you who hate the looks of this car, I'm guessing the computer or phone screen doesn't do it justice. Also, this car is from 2015-2016. Everyone saying it looks like bits and pieces of other new cars should remember that those companies most likely copied those features from Aston.
The front looks like a Honda Accord to me
Schweet!!! 🤯
Everybody complaining about that sunroof but forgetting that the phantom also has no sunroof? Also I am pretty sure that in Dubai it is only a hindrance making everyone being cooked
Love the styling. Very cool looking car.
Don’t see a million$$$$ Don’t see the most beautiful sedan. The paint looks something a 18 year old would do with a rattle can.
crapiest 1 million $ car ever!
_Its ugly._  Honestly the E38 is definetly more beautiful to me. This looks like the designer team had some strange disagreements.
I would pay 55k for it
If this car had a Hyundai badge instead of the Lagonda badge, Doug would have gave a 5/10 for styling
This guy has zero taste if he thinks a 7 series is beautiful
None adjustable head rest???
I bet this car will depreciate to a 100k or less within 5 to 10 years. A RR or Bentley in their highest spec is much more practical and iconic than this. I pity the poor sap who would eventually sell this after a few years.
2 yrs from now it will be a 150,000 car
Looks like a cheap Dodge...
To be honest that is a really ugly ass car. Just being honest.
Nioce
Sorry, doug.... idk about this review... What you're paying for is the rarity you say, sure, but the styling? i havn't seen it irl, but honestly, i can't say i like it, not even close to beautiful imo.
looks like an old 740i from the side
Looks like a Genesis G100.
Are you gonna review that lambo? Please say yes
I don’t see it!! Over paid by 600k
Whats the clanking noise you hear several times in the beginning of the video?
A car that looks like Honda Accord is the most beautiful car ever.  Lol
Hate those dated looking ac vents
Looks a bit like a Dodge Charger.  When is the stupid matte paint fad going to go away~?
Doug “You will not encounter a sedan more beautiful than this”  Me: Mk1 S60, Mk3 S60, NG Saab 9-5, Volvo Amazon, Volvo 244, Volvo 144, Volvo 744 face 2, Volvo 944, Koenigsegg GeMera
FORD FOCUS turn signals, this is a money machine right here, I saw what you did there Aston!!!!!!
It looks weirdly similar to a genesis G80. Same logo and front shape. I really can't tell if I like the taraf or not.
I would have gotten a different color. Matte black is not my favorite on this car.
I get that its rare and sleek and unique but theres no ignoring how underwhelming the whole package is for 1mil. Just seems expensive for expensiveness sake.
Oh wow the front is giving me Ford Fusion vibes
The most overpriced car ever very subtle interior and the exterior looks like it was designed back in the 90's
Not worth for a million
Whomever bought this wanted exclusivity and not luxury because this is certainly not in the Rolls Royce class. Definitely not the same inpact as what the original Langonda had when it was shown to the public for the first time.
It looks great, but it costs just way too much for what it is, especially for the electronic drawbacks. I'd rather get the Lincoln Continental Coach Door.
it's like an old school luxury car. you're paying for the way it's put together, the materials, it's design and drivetrain rather than some tech "features" and touchscreens.
How the heck is it a million $ car ?  Anyone would buy 2 phantom rather than this
Am I the only one that’s disappointed that the taraf doesn’t have cooled seats?!?
The steering wheel has as much tech as my 2006 honda civic :/
It looks like a Ford Fusion concept car.
The ass of this car really doesn't look good!
3 things mostly mentioned in the vid:  1 - LAGONDA TARAF ! LAGONDA TARAF ! LAGONDA TARAF !  2 - Stitch is Good  3 - Logo is everywhere ..
The interior is ugly, the same colour leather everywhere is uninteresting and generic looking
You seem more like a younger version of Jay Leno every day.
The side profile reminds me of the Polestar.  Edit: That key hole tho
it looks like BMW and AUDI had a bastard child
Gotta love a $1 million car that has isofix anchor points on the back seats...
I cant watch this.  This is terrible.  I love astons but this is garbage and doug is shilling this thing hard.  Distinctive front end.....of an accord.
This mans had a lamborghini Sian in the carsnbids preview but decides to show us a glorified Honda Accord
So its a million dollar rapide... which is already an old overprized "luxury" sedan...
Doug, you brand where. This car is whatever looking
Oh my goodness! Doug you wonderful human being, thank you for this review. I love this car.
you will need at least a gallon of leather conditioner for the interior of that thing! and also i hope you can hide those tablet holders because they don't match the car at all
This is the best car Aston makes.....too bad  it's 1 million.
The interior looks WAY too dated along with the tech.
I feel scammed just by watching this video
Is it just my imagination or has Doug really stepped up his pointy-finger-hand-modeling game lately?
This is the most hideous feces-shaped piece of steel I've ever seen and never want to see again.
Looks like a more stylized version of a Mazda 3 to me 😳
It look like a china' copycat.
Looks like a Ford Fusion that got used as the strap in a towing battle
The headlights and grille, specifically how the headlights meet with the grille, reminds me a lot of the 2020 Ford Explorer headlight/grille design.
Front grill looks like grill of 2019 accord  🤣
>wants to get called a lagonda not aston  >reuse bunch of parts from aston and even ford >costs a fucking mil >okay then
Looks and exclusivity, those are the only things it has going for it, you would have to be crazy to buy this over a Phantom for  $1 million .
worth it in my opinion ......never mind.
New drinking game. Take a drink every time Doug says “beautiful”.  I think Dougs wife is jealous of how many time he calls this car beautiful.
Trash for a million dollars
Lagonda: A car that bought Doug to his knees 9:13
I'd like to see Mr. Beast buy it and give it to a homeless person.
To my knowledge, "torath" doesn't mean luxury, it's something like a legacy or something that resembles a long lived tradition etc...
Totally not worth its price. It was designed for arabian millionares to give them something special for special price on 100th anniversary  but its far behind rolls quality and far too expensive EDIT: btw for me its awful. The general shape and design are uglier than my drawings EDIT2: I think S-class/7 series/ A8 are more advanced and nicer for 1/10 of price of this thing
Honestly I love the look, but I don't million dollar love it.
The front end is ugly... looks like a rebaged DB-8
Taraf in Arabica means He lives his life in bliss and bliss 🤓
I want to know who in the right mindset would pay $1M to have this car on their driveway.....
Why exactly is this better than a rapide?
1 million dollars for this😂🤣... Yup, I'm still sleeping n dreaming
Million bucks for this?... You got to kiddin' me. It looks like the next generation of Dodge Charger... Totally meh...
Very interesting Doug nice one.
ترف
can’t wait to pick one of these up for 65k in 2024
Sometimes cars are great because they are so simple. Cars don't need to be 1,000,000 dollars and have a ton of extra features to get you where your going.
Honda Accord rear-ended a Ford Taurus and AM sold it for million bucks.
A very underwhelming car considering its price tag.
https://youtu.be/u7Nr0afHahw
10:04 fail
"For the 120 Lagonda Taraf owners out there, nothing else will do" Yeah Doug, except the probably 300 other cars they own because money doesn't matter to them.
....... *$1,000,000 for this shit?*
I honestly don't see a 1mln $ factor here. I don't even see 100k $ factor... unless it has a lifetime warranty
Doug said LOGANDA 41 times!!! :-)
The amount of time he said “and” 🤣🤣
Who the hell let doug take this car out with shorts on?!
this thing looks hideous.
21:30 is it a factory 1 000 000 car or a garage built luhury camry 3.5?
Tbh the front looks a bit like a Ford Mondeo to me...
I bet Doug didn't have troubles writing essay in school.
13:35 ... Why? Just incase they Jam and you need to get out in case of an emergency??
Looks like a upgraded Honda accord
I'd be surprised if it this car goes up much in value. Might be pretty and rare, but honestly is not very unique or memorable.
If the USB ports in the back are intended to charge the tablets in this million dollar car, you would think they would have mounted them in the back of the front seats, next to the iPad mounts…
Car for the middle east and no ventilated seats in the back? Damn, Aston Martin million bucks doesn't buy you a lot.
The price tag is ALMOST as dumb as the name lol
Looks like a saab
Kind of like expensive wine.  You aren't necessarily paying for quality as much as you are paying for exclusivity.
This IS the most beautiful sedan in the world. Don't be stingy with the styling and cool scores Dougie: 10 and 10
The worst car for the price ever!! It looks bland, cheap and outdated... even a $180k porsche panamera have better interior than this $1mil piece of crap
Great content.
Good luck putting petrol in this in the rain.
I don't see any detail that would be more beautiful about this than the Audi RS5 or RS7 are. THOSE cars have beautiful lines.
Yea like everyone else here that can't afford anything close to half of this. "How dare they charge that much" lol
It's just a car made from a spare parts bin it's not that special
trash
Never  expected a video like this from Doug Hard to believe
20:30 they steal a cup from soviet jail and polished it, unveliable
"The cool thing about this Lagonda...is that it says Lagonda on it" If putting the fancy badge on things is all it takes then I'd love to see how excited Doug gets over an Abarth Punto- those things even have the Abarth logo on the engine.
They could have made the climate controls dual zone
The e38 bmw is way more beautiful than this thing
toorath doesn't mean ultimate luxury but means legacy and it is written "تراث"
Wait let me get this straight : one row of the tail lights is used as a turn signal??!!  SOLD!!!
Front looks like a Ford Mondeo
Hard to pay $1,000,000 just for the exterior styling
looks like a mazda 6
I wasn’t aware that this even made it into production.  The video was an absolute treat.  I was curious what car preceded your S-Class review.  Thanks for another entertaining video
10:36 sitting in a 1M car with dirty knees making you a rock star!
theme for this video: It says lagonda not aston martin
Sweeeeet dodge charger!
front: ford fusion side: genesis G80 rear: dodge charger inside: aston martin
This is the most generic-looking car I've ever seen. I bet the dealership is having a hard time selling this piece of shit and wanted Doug to emphasize how "beautiful" this car is so hopefully some idiot would finally drop his cash on this bullshit car.
Lagonda Teraf  Honda Giraffe
before we get started...
19:30 surely, these shows are a comedy...
Even a LEXUS LS has more luxury for 1/10 THE PRICE.
A million bucks and a pinhole in the leather in the ceiling. Doug can't sell this one
How can this be a 2018 Lagonda Taraf, when the production was from 2015 to 2016?🤔
Aston Martin Music 🎶
The front looks like a Honda Accord.... blegh
Firstime that doug faked a review ..:))
Taraf in romania is a gypsy/folk music channel on tv
Hahah...no.
I've been waiting for this one
Thisss is a nice ford focus
The car is such a waste of money that I literally left the video in between (by 16:50) for the first time while watching Doug's videos.
And just like the original lagona its ugly and stupid
when will you review the aston martin one 77?
This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think the exterior of this car is hideous.
It kind of reminds me of a Chrysler 300 on the side panels.
No❤️
“Cars and bids” Doug you are just so creative with naming things
That car is a joke, a pretty bad one
Doesn't even have cooled seats in the back, or messaging seats for the back or front. Kind of a big RIP off.
It's absolutely gorgeous dont deny it
5 OUT OF 10 FOR FEATURES???  WTF???  WHAT ARE YOU SMOKING????
Why does it look like a dodge charger?
The exact word is actually Torath which means heritage (ie lagonda revival from past Aston Martin heritage).  There is no such word as 'taraf' in arabic, nor with the mentionned meaning.
18:02 how much pixels in it?
Reminds me of Saab 9-5 a lot..
I didn't like the car and came to see if y'all didn't too, seems were on the same page.
Maybe if I see it in person I might see that beauty you're talking about, coz 20 seconds left in the video and I still don't see it
Am i the only one who finds this thing obscenely overpriced?
Lmaooooo Aston Martin just made this car to hit a lick on f*ckers who have more money than brains
My 8,000 dollar VW passat has the running lights that turn into turn signals too. That's not that much of a rare option on cars, Sir Doug
Come on doug, you will be reviewing the centennario next right?😂
I was 100x more excited for the Venza 😅
Thiisss, is the ugliest overpriced car, ever.
Ignoring the exposed keyhole in the door, that paint is a finger print magnet. The area around the door handle looks like the Driver ate some fried chicken before getting into the car.
Meh...... history will be the judge and likely won't be to kind.
Marvel should've partnered with Aston Martin, not Audi
Is that the new Hyundai Genesis G80 front  end?  Way to go, Aston Martin...
Hmmm....not bad, but i'd rather slum it and buy the Rolls Phantom VIII.
What kind of idiot buys this car?😂😂😂
The centario👀
It kinda looks like a Ford Fusion lol
The hydraulic for the door is exposed?? And it doesnt even keep the door in place? Luxury my ass. My chevy s10 does this by just wiping off the grease from the hinges.
This is one of the most overpriced cars I've ever seen.
A million bucks fur a stretched Rapide? What are you smoke’n Aston Martin 😂
GARMINNN WTFFFF this may be a car for a guy on the backseat, but garmin blyat!
Strange, the steering wheel color doesn’t match the rest of the interior.
Honestly the front end looks like an elantra....... Also, my dad's toyota also has bang and olufsen in it, it's just not in a contraption
Funny... just 2 days ago I saw this car on Gulf street in Kuwait and couldnt tell which Aston Martin model it was but didn't think much about it. Had zero idea it was this much "exclusive and expensive"
How i lost it when i just saw this car, so awesome good looking lines and no crappy overstyling *O* Apsolutely deserves the 10 in Styling!
Thisss is a new leather handbag worth 1 Million Dollar
This is a rapide with more leg room in the back lol
I bet Doug gives his kids a Dougscore
So this car is basically a very elaborate money laundering scheme...
Seeing that lamborghini in the ars and bids promotion makes me excited for next week
Doug you should invest on a floor mat for those hard shot that require you to kneel down
Cant help but think for fusion from the front😂 idc how exclusive this car is it doesnt scream 1 million
ohhh, seriously? they didn't even attached these tablets at the seats to the car's electrical system and you need to charge it by YOURSELF? i don't even speaking about this refrigerator and heated seat adgustment panel (and many more)(why is it plastic? why should i touch PLASTIC after paying a 1 000 000 for a car?!), that doesn't even matter after chargable ipads.
I guess it's OK for rich people who are far more interested in appearances than in technical quality.  It would probably impress the Joneses.
So... still don’t know why this mediocre luxury car is worth $1 million
Looks like the mazda6 concept
Guys he got a centenario
i swear the front lights were stolen from a ford fusion
Who would be sick enough to buy this and not a may back or a rolls royce
If masarati ghibli and the Aston Martin rapide had a child
my S550 has rear cooled seats... and it's 10 years old. this is a joke. Doug.. you're a joke.
So...the value is $1million dollars literally because they priced it at that. Not nearly it’s real mechanical value.
this car is max worth 250k
Like a Peugeot
A million dollar.. and doesn't have a sunroof.🤭
So they made $100 million selling these 😂
Would rather buy a lifetime supply of candy corn with the money. No wonder it was sold in the middle east. Cant imagine buying such a tasteless excuse of a million dollars.
And a key hole on a one million dollars car?  Funny he didn’t laugh at it.
10:00 i have this in my ford fiesta 2004
The side profile is kinda weird TBH. It feels like a RR phantom butt is fused to an aston martin.
10/10 styling? Yes from the side the car looks great but on an angle it looks like a boat, too many straight lines.
This is a lot of money for something that looks like a Hyundai Sonata from afar.
Intresting
Well pf course it’s only available in the Middle East.. Built to be driven onece and parked along with the other Sheik toys..
You didn't see the new genesis G80 or GV80 ..i think you will change your thoughts 📷
Nice Honda Accord sport
what??? 1000000$??? oh, nooooo! English, are you out of your mind?
It looks like a charger in the back and it looks like a Hyundai In the front what a waste of a million dollars
O hell no........
Designer 1: how much wheelbase u want Designer 2: yes.
Aston Martin made the most expensive badge-engineered car ever lol
WTF is this even
If you look carefully, it caries a lot of esthetique qualities from the old Lagonda especially the way the hood is tilted also the the front and back lights kinda reminds me of a Dodge Charger.
What is the tin noise during the drive?!?!
The grill looks like a fusion of an aston martin and an audi grill... still beautiful
WHERE DID THE MILLION DOLLARS GO!??!
That Aventador looks like chiron...
Y does it have the scat pack rims
Un pi$#at! Nici panoramic nu are. Si se mai numește si Taraf. Sănătate! Respect pentru domnu' Doug!
Unpopular opinion: I think this is one of the best looking sedan ever
I could build a better car with $1M... Or maybe not, but still
"Honey, let's go to the bedroom. I want you" "Nah babe I gotta know the dougscore"
He says distinctive so much when it looks like so many other cars
Where is that centenario review?
Doug the type of dude to show you his wife's "quirks and features" before he lets you take her out for a "test drive"
Is there a half inch panel gap between the front door and the B pillar??
Bro a genesis or a Benz would be a much better money investment
They are charging it 1 million because they can.   And pls pls pls its not luxurious than a rolls Royce. Its not even luxurious than a 7 series or a  S class.
Firstly thought it's a new Honda Accord. But then I realized - this is a leather bag.
For 1 million bucks i would expect a butler opening the door for me..
So...$1milliom dollars for leather seats, silly speakers and a door that stays in place.  Oh I forgot and an ashtray!
Doug: Mentions how the Lagonda Taraf was supposed to be for the Middle East markets Me, a Middle-Eastern: 😏
This is the very first time I say that Aston Martin made ugly car and just shitting people with the price for that weird vehicle. Also it will be the very first time I give Dough "dislike" .
At first glance the car looks like a Maserati.... I hate Maserati. Overpriced POS
I'm still stuck on the fact that this car isn't keyless entry
I'll give 10 dollars for this car...
If I had this car it’d sell it immediately and by a much better and cheaper luxury car and still have like $500 k left over
Let me tell you something you already know...      THIS CAR IS OVERPRICED
I’d wager my non-existent Stimulus check that the Arabic people would easily take an S-Class, 7-series, Bentley, or a Rolls Royce over this ugly fucking car any day of the week... there’s no way this vehicle is worth 1 million dollars. Not when it looks like a Ford Fusion and Dodge Charger shat out a baby with the Scatpack wheels to boot...
A Garmin navigation system? In 2018? Really? [Turns off YouTube, stands up, walks away]
I have enough room for my head, now that’s the coolest feature cars could have!
But imagine the depreciation numbers :oooo
The front looks like a mix of Charger and Fusion. The trunk looks cheaper than a Toyota, and the badge is even a copy of Hyundai Genesis.
9:57 epic fail 😆
Stop leaning on the cars!!!
Almost lost me on the entire video when he exclaimed how "beautiful" this car is.  I love Doug reviews...but seriously Doug, come on man this car is a bloated, overpriced Rapide and the Rapide isn't even a good car.  Are you being paid by the dealership to lie about the cars just to get the car for a review???
Bentley and Roll Royce headquarters are probably laughing their ass off right now
Looks like a honda accord from the front
Those people who are trying to justify $1Million Price tag here in comment section, either they work in Aston Martin or they have 0% Knowledge about cars.
You will be better off with a S550 or a BMW 7 Series. This car looks basic 😕
That is a HIDEOUS car lol....I guess beauty really is in the eye of the beholder lol
27:28 the camera is shaking
Is there any nice car places in Ireland
Doug really got his hands on a Centenario :0
Aluminium isn't magnetic (or that magnetic)
Wow, 1Million to get a british S65
Thiiiiiiiiiiiis car is HIDEOUS!
Tbh I don't find it the BEST LOOKING.. it might be just me tho
This is an amazing 4 door luxury sedan. But paying 1m for it is a little bit expensive. Just a little bit.
I admire Doug so much
Does it come with rockets?
This gotta be the sexist sedan I’ve seen in a very long time
Urghhhhhh! The back end curve is horrendous! Like some aspects but I could never love this from all angles like the db9.
Thissss... is the car that only the top 10% going to afford in the times of economic depression, fake statistics, infinity QE, and 20% unemployment rate where 50% of Americans don't have a $1000 dollars savings! Yes, that's approx. 160 million people! Hey, Doug! You should review 10-15 year old Toyotas or stuff like that! What Americans actually can afford! Well, if the government continues with the $600 dollar benefits, MMT!
You really jump sacred me with the Centenario...
Man that's an expensive Ford fusion
This thing is awful
this trash can't even match k900
If this car came out in 2008 then it would be worth it
The front end reminds me of a quartz regalia
That car sucks.
Comparing this car to a rolls royce is like comparing supreme to LV or gucci
That navigation system what the actual fuck Aston
such a shitty car for a million dollars
Any child could tell you that this car isn't worth $1,000,000.  I was honestly expecting a little more automotive/journalistic integrity from this channel. I would have had more respect for you had you done a video titled "Can you believe they want 1mil for a Kardashian Ford Fusion?"   Seriously... this is some bullshit.
The front end kinda looks like a new accord
I rather buy a loaded Porsche Panamera and save a million
a luxury car where your head is at roof level when you're on your knees should not cost more than a rolls royce. but that's just my opinion.   edit: hold the fuck on, this car is absolute trash and shouldn't cost more than a mercedes s class never mind a rolls or a bently. the interior is shit and looks like something from the 2005 era. its a scam.
The cooler can store two kool aids
When is the Centenario video dropping?
To be honest it kind of looks like a car out of GTA V. Cool video though!
So you buy $1,000,000 car and you have to charge your rear seat entertainment system manually from center console... actually WTF
So that's how a Million dollar Garbage looks like 🤯
I like how Doug shows what car he is going to review next in the Car's & Bid's promo at the beginning of the video :D
Sorry, but I HATE the dull finish on this and several other cars.  As well as looking like primer, it is VERY impractical.  Just washing it is a major nuisance, and God forbid a bird craps on it in the sunshine.  The emperor has no clothes!
buy one of these to get on the valkarie list or is it one of those "if you ask the price you cannot afford it cars"?
Fun fact: " Taraf " means luxury in Arabic
Dear Aston Martin ...go outside and get me a twitch👏🏾🖐🏾✌🏾...this is horrible 1mil for this crap...lol id rather buy a house 🏡
Doug should also have mentioned that one of the reasons why it's so expensive, is because the body is carbon fibre..
It look like a ford fusion with luxury features ....
The front-end successfully copied by Mazda Vision-Concept.
The front looks like Mazda 6
10000000 dollar and you u have to closed trunk by u self :D
Front end looks like a Honda Accord. I can't get over that...
Heated, but cooled seats for Middle East,  hmm interesting
$1M and you don't get a sunroof.....honestly this car sucks
No sunroof, no buy. Also, though Ford is guilty of ripping off Aston Martin's headlights design, AM has no excuse for shipping a million dollar car with Taurus headlights with absolutely no distinctive features. I'd sooner but a Hyundai with lane-change cameras in the speedometer.
its things like this not scolding companies for making crap like this for a million,instead of just calling them out ,makes the company feel like they can make anything with an aston martin brand and have it justifed by someone (doug)....
It literally has a Honda Accord front end, and a Dodge Charger rear end.  There's barely anything that justifies the price tag. That "beautiful headliner" literally has wrinkles in it and it's only a two year old car, and that matte black paint looks like a lower priced Maaco paint job. Just look at the smudges on the rear door, you'd expect they'd use high quality paint and materials for the price.
It's not a RR Phantom competitor, not even Maybach. Probably, just the S Klass competitor
Doug DeMuro is like...Fanny Pack Jay Leno? I can't pin it.
Overpriced
That's a waste of money
The front looks the new Nissan Altima lol
Why would you buy this when you can have 2 phantoms? Wow
This car is so stupid and so ugly for a million dollars
When you tink that it have a duratec based engine
“Most beautiful 4 door car ever”  Lmao
A new Camry is better looking then this
Am i really the only one who thinks this car looks really cool? And I really like the fact that they named the car based on the Arabic language instead of something European like everyone else does. It isn't worth a million dollars in my opinion but it was made mostly for the Middle East
And the stitching’s crappy too 🤔
Doug, when is the Cars&Bids app coming out?
Lets just say i had a million dollar. I wont buy this car for certain
What was that noise at 24:19 ?
It’s always a good day when Doug uploads!
I’m arabic and I don’t know what does lagonda mean
04:52 I haven't seen an apparent key hole on the door panel in a very long time and even then it was in an economy car
A brand new Corolla or Camry looks way better than this and I'd buy it over this crappy shit
Beautiful car but imo it's not worth 1 million, half a million yes. Considering the interior is exactly the same as the Rapide with just a few changes.
BANG & Olufson, garbage.
You should watch his review on the Cadillac ELR 3 years ago.. He was outraged over "SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS" 🤣  Now 1 mil is like 🤷‍♂️ oh Doug.. times have changed..
1 million is a bullshit price tag
So what year was that Lagonda
1 million is the price not the value. Doesn't even match the German Phantom. The more I watched, the more i got disappointed 😂😂😂
10 Years later... Hoovies Garage: I purchased the cheapest Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf. Not just any Taraf the one my daddy Doug reviewed 10 years ago
Am I the only one who thinks that it’s hideous
Forgive me if I'm too poor to understand but I really don't see the reason why this car is worth more than a fully loaded phantom
Bro you need glasses this car get 10/10 for styling and the phantom get a 6?
For that price you would expect a driver and butler to come with it
Am I the only one who thinks it’s resemble kind of like the Ford Fusion.
REVIEW THAT BLUE CENTENARIO
It looks like a hybrid between ford fusion and kia stinger 🤮🤮
What advantages does this motorcar have against a train? Which, I can also afford.
Very cool, but when was it made?
If I'm going to spend $1 million on a car, I better not see ANY plastic. Just buy a Phantom.
sneer at the commoner next to you......lmao
What about the maybach exelero?
I will probably choose rr phantom
... you're paying a million for stitching and the different logo. I'm not even joking. unbelievable. Styling is subjective. Rarity is a fabrication based on what one deems as valuable. You're paying for fancy stitching and a logo.  Go buy a Phantom and help 500k families with the "extra".
why does it look like they copied Honda's headlight?
Who else can’t wait for Doug to review the Koenigsess Gemera? It’s a four seater. Does THAT make it the new most expensive sedan??
what lambo model is it at around 0:45?
That refrigerator is from the Mercedes S550
It's a good thing it costs $1 million, because there isn't much else to brag about other than how much it costs.
This is Doug's equivalent of NeedleDrop's MBDTF review.
Horrible looking with an even more horribly looking interior.
16:33 an exposed phillips head screw?  Seriously??
I personally like the look of the car. The first words in my head were beautiful and gorgeous. As the review continued though, I really fell out of love with this car. The interior is just so lackluster, and the exposed drink cooler unit in the trunk sealed it for me.
Ford fusion front end, Honda odyssey rear end, no tint, no sunroof, foreskin seat belt covers, horrendous steering wheel, turn signal stalk from a ford escape. Yep.. this is astons $1m "luxury sedan"
It isn't worth 200.000
The Brand New V12 Mercedes Maybach has 100x the Luxury with curtains, self driving capabilities , and oh SoOo much more for a 1/5th the price. Then again the S class is the #1 selling Large Luxury Sedan in the World for 48 yrs straight!! 🏆🍾❤
side profle is an alfa gt
Not worth anything close to a million bucks. It was sold to suckers with too much oil money
Originally they made it just for Dr Evil but then other customers wanted one.
doug must be on drugs to call this the most beautiiful car wtf...lolthe side profile looks terrible,the front is ok and the back looks horrid...stay off the drugs doug
Calling this more beautiful than the 7 Series is an insult to 95% of car people.
That so called "navigation system" it's a joke for this type of cars.
Looks like a mix between Honda and Hyundai
What is so cool about the dots on the seats,RR got better seats for half the price
my sister caught me watching this video and said "who is this quirky guy?"
09:42 Doug what's with the chicken crest on your hair? New styling? 🤷‍♂️
The gage cluster is not a screen most luxury cars the gage is a screen I think this is a more expensive ford fusion.
This car is ugly af... most bugattis,  bmws ond every lambo look better than thist trash... even the db9 or db11 look so much better
Who would buy this over a rolls? :s
Somehow the lights remind me of honda...like civic type R
Nice but not even remotely million dollar nice.
Seems like the dealership has sponsored you to try to sell this crap. Only thing this car has to it is the exclusivity. I really hate how your "reviews" are getting less and less professional. No wonder companies like GM are being cautious about giving you cars to review. You can do better than this Doug.
Looks shit
The satin  black paint just distracts from the car’s lines, and it makes the car look far less than million dollars. A million bucks for a car is God’s way of saying you have way too much money. I wonder what the deprecation of this car will be after four years. Probably a few Corvettes and a couple of Porsche Gt3s.
Too freaking long 🤦🏾‍♂️
This Car gonna Depreciate bad in the next years....
I would rather get both phantom and cullinan instead of buying this car.  (BTW hit the like button if u think the same)
Stop saying cars and bids
One million dollars.🤙.
Beautiful car.....
Not appealing to me in terms of design. Front end somewhat ugly
I agree with Doug on both the Taraf and the E38. The most beautiful sedans ever made. Good thing the e38 costs 1% of what the Taraf does.
If I was Bill G or even Warren B I won't even look at that car twice
I think you would need to have more money than brains...and also be on meth, in order to pay 1m for this car. This car should be no more than 250k. I really tried hard to see the 1m price in this car and couldn't. A rolls Royce phantom which is half the price literally oozes luxury. Even a maybach takes this car to town.
Love the interior color but the matte paint is a no for me
wow aston martin trying to sell a 40 grand car for 1 million....buyers deserved to be kicked in the nuts
the new ford focus sedan is looking good
Beautiful exterior but the rear tail light design reminds me of a Ford Fusion.
Meh.
i love how Doug always mocks the cars unnecessary features lmao
I’d rather have a DB9
So in conclusion, a giant waste of money
So, it will experience the “VW Phaeton”-syndrome: I would prefer to have 2 RR (or any 2 cars) than 1 Aston Martin ...
The tail lights use red led behind a red lense for brakes, the turn signal are 4 additional white led behind the red lense which appears orange.
Turn signals change color, very distincive. If you say so, Doug =)
Looks like a Mazda futuristic luxury car. THAT WOULD BE WORTH 150k
Ugly front
To quote Top Gear..."They charge that price...because they can". Still want one though.
But that Lamborghini?!!!
sellout. everybody knows the rapide is the most gorgeous sedan ever
Got the body lines of a 2011 Malibu. 🤢
What is the year of this exact car he’s reviewing? I don’t think I heard him say the year. 🤔
That Blue Accent Centenario 🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿
How to lose credibility in one video
(Turath) means tradition / heritage In Arabic .
this is an 2013 car so outdated electronics is inevitable if you want that stuff go and buy another Mercedes
Still going on about his shitty auction site - this guy is literally shameless
Okay I get how Rolls Royce's digital driver's display is nothing but a tachometer. But seriously a million dollar car with analog dials? JEEEZ
Looks like a Mazda-3! Aston Martin is steppin’ it up!
Anyone else think this car is kinda ugly?
Hmm the front headlight from the side kinda looks like Honda accord. Oh shit, brain, stop stop stop stop.
I can tell why it's the most expensive luxury car just by the looks
This car is to beautiful !!
Imagine paying 1 million dollars and you get a ford focus turn signal and screen
Wow. $1M and it doesn't come with equipment you can get on a Ford Fusion like adaptive cruise, cooled seats, well-designed navigation, sunroof, etc.... I don't get it.
Looks like a Kia Stinger
Stretched Ford Fusion. The glass panel between the windows was beautiful tho.
There's no way I'd pay that much for this car (if i had the money). The exterior styling is nice, but the reuse of crummy technology inside is just piss poor at this price range.
Yes.  10 for styling, even in dull black.
If it was aluminum why is it sticking to a magnet?
Laughable infotainment system for a 1 million dollar car...  Also, no sunroof? Really?
Something about Aston Martin, since the '80s, seems generic and likely to be broken down and out of style soon.  There's no way I'd buy one.
The worst color for that car. The worst colored calipers for that car.  This car has to be BEIGE or GOLDEN METALLIC or something similarly classy.  And grey calipers, please
Two words. Not. Worth.
There’s only that car in NorthAmerica and one in Mexico, that’s it. Therefore, you can only find it in other continenta
What is that plastic rectangle on the front grill
My new drinking game is that you take a shot every time doug says Lagonda
💩😱💩😱💩😱🤣🤣🤣
The company name is actually called, “ASTON MARTIN LAGONDA.”
Honestly if this car within the Lexus LS price range i would take the Lexus without thinking a bit.
When you can save 900k and buy a Maybach instead that has everything the Aston has and looks way better. Love our  2017 v12 maybach.. The lagunda looks like a Hyundai Sonata from the front. Also could buy a rolls, Bentley, and Masarati and still have a couple hundred thousand left.
right, so it's 10 times the price of a new audi a8, but has outdated features
My grandfather's 88 Chrysler New Yorker had a soft close trunk. I would always forget about it and slam it shut .
A car that expensive with a Ford turn signal stock and a car navigation that honda uses I think the genesis gv80 and the new g80 and g90 looks better.
purchase an aston martin rapide and graft on a bmw i8 front end then slap on the genesis badge
0:37 Daddy Doug really teasing us with a sexy ass Centenario
The likes and dislikes are from people that cant afford it
I honestly think most new sedans are prettier than this car. I think people convince themselves that cars look nicer just because of the price.
Bruh, chill!! Y’all going off on this car like crazy. I know you hating because you can’t afford it. I can’t afford it, but I ain’t hating. So RELAX!😂
Nice fushion bro
looks like a mondeo
Has it also broken the record for most expensive Ford Fusion trim?
I honestly thought this was a redesigned Dodge Charger.
Welcoming to the ring, A rear like an old Buick  And the front side of a 2018 Ford Impala ....
Yeah that’s a no from me dawg. That car is hideous. Like Kia has better looking cars
Am I the only one that loves this car in the comments??
0:00-2:50 Doug fanboying over the price of this car 2:52 is basically the start of the video     I love your videos Doug, I’m just teasing
Beginning of the video: “There’s no way this thing is worth two Rolls” End of the video: “yup”
Laghonda Accord
It's okay for 250k But for 1M?! Nope.
the next car he is reviewing is the Lamborghini at :39
Expected more from it  Lagonda didn't even match with base s class on luxury
Intensely beautiful car 😐
Doug are you being paid to say this car "the most beautiful car "?
This car would be much better looking if the front windshield did not have such a gradual rack and the back window did not have a squared off kink, it is like this thing does not know if it wants to be a Rapide or a Brougham....
If I had a million dollars, I'd get a car with a sunroof. My corolla has a nicer steering wheel than that it looked like it was straight out of a ford taurus lmao doug should have done this car the way he did the ghibli
Doug : insert key radio : DAB
Underwhelming, even ugly car
0:45 CENTENARIO REVIEW!?!?!?!?!!!
A million dollar car and couldn't even hide the keyhole on the door.
Looks like a $1M Genesis G90 to me 😂 still looks gorgeous!
you still have time to delete this video doug...
For that price tag I would rather have 5 Bentley gt's than this failed crossover sedan lol
Is it wrong for me to say id confidently rather have a completely optioned wraith than this thing?
For the price should had at least 900hp
Yo, who’s excited to see him review that Lamborghini next 🤗
It looks like a sporty ford fusion to me it looks great I love the car but not worth 1 million dollars I rather get a rolls or bently
Dose the door key hole trigger any one else .
"I love the fact that the Worlds most expensive luxury, million dollar sedan gets a 7 for quality,  but!   "A 100 grand Lexus gets 10!"
Looks like the GTA 5 clone of the Rapide
I can‘t see ANY reason why this car is worth 1 million $! Compared to other ultimate luxury cars the Lagonda should be around 400k! There ist nothing special to justify that price tag!
Ads are 30 seconds long before the episode starts, ridiculous
Doug "you can drive one around if u have 1 million dollars" nice flex
Aston Fusion
What the fuck is that roofline? lmao it's not pretty it looks like a stretched out american sedan that costs a million dolars for some unfathomable reason these compromised oddjob 4 door sports cars only make sense if they don't cost as much as an entire warehouse of high-end specialized cars each fit for different purposes.
7:50 'This is Aston Martins luxury brand' Wtf is Aston Martin then LOL
Doug is the kind of guy to tease us with upcoming car reviews so we watch his Cars and Bids ad
This has been a dream car of mine for aaaaaaaaaaaaaages, but my favourite feature didn't get a mention! The CFRP body panels!
something about the taraf lines remind me of recent mazdas and their concept
Tbh it looks like a super luxury ... mazda in the front
The handle at 12:15 looks like it's ready to break  the 30k window  not a great idea lol....they tried too hard for this car I rather have the  1980s lagonda
"at the time" "of that era" ... It was 2 years ago. -_-
A MILLION for a 2008 center console hahaha
Rapide in a tuxedo?
$1M? These are probably made to just to doop the Arabs into what they like, exclusivity! But id say the Moon is $200k! Id rather a Mulsanne.
the rapide is also one of the most beautiful ones
Comfort 7 for a million dollar sedan, OK
Looks more masarati than aston martin
Doug, why haven't you reviewed that Centenario?
Remember when they wanted to make this a ugly SUV?
Doug : Thisssssssssss is a $200,000 luxury car sold for $1,000,000 ...
??????
Looks like an limited 2018 Ford Impala
Looks like one of the new Mazda 3 from the side lolol
This car is symbolic of what modern Britain has become
shit looks like the new RAM in the front
You have to add a 'Skip' button so viewers can bypass your cars&bids plug with every video.  It's super annoying.
Sorry, but not worth millions.  Too much show.  Too much in every way.   Except for the price, I would clearly prefer the BMW 7.
10 out of 10 for styling  What a joke
My eyes became wide open when i saw that centenario teaser
My HP laptop also has B and O speakers
Doug reviewing this car like he getting a cut from that million dollar check 😂💰
An incredibly ugly car. Only blind man can pay  a million dollars for this.
I rather buy a Mercedes for 1/10 of the price
Mondeo style
The mercedes amg GT 63s 4 door coupé looks better to be honest.
I thought last time s500 video stand in front a lagonda and talked about the website was the craziest thing ever.....but today when I saw a centenario I knew I was wrong 🤔
10:17 An exposed hydraulic is luxurious?
Who else would rather buy a rolls Royce Phantom?
My 2017 Mercedes-Benz E Class looks 15 years newer than this car on the inside haha. The outside of this car is spectacular though.
COMFORT & QUALITY 7???? R U SLEEPING??
I like the car but it looks like a non branded car from a videogame.
"I'm doing it, it gets a 10/10"  Me: "You did it!  You crazy son-of-a-bitch you did it!"
Youtube keeps cutting off the "THISSSSSS" from the start of Doug videos...
A million dollar car and still no sunroof. Wow
Genesis G80 with a quite different back?
That must be the most overpriced car in the history of the automobile. A Rolls Royce Phantom is better in every way, as are most Bentleys.
Looks like an accord ....
Didn’t even know this existed. Now I know why
Haven’t seen viewers be in such disagreement with Doug about a car in a while. It wouldn’t be my first choice, but can we talk about how he’s reviewed a Lamborghini Centenario!!!
The front looks like a jetta
Damn Doug, another mouthwatering piece of perfection. Wish you could upload a video every day.
Loool is it just me or does this kinds look like a ford mondeo
In this case the more practical option is to buy a decent sized house and a Lamborghini Aventador lmao
Honestly, the new Audi s8 seems more luxurious
Silver ashtray. Doug sold me on this. I want it.
Whole video in one short term = *DISTINCTIVE.*
Awesome
I don't see the hype. Looks normal. There are vehicles under 55k that look way better than this car.
Special market demand in the Middle East haha. Aston martin knows only rich princes can be foolish enough to buy this car
did the dealership kidnapped his wife or something? The doug score is officially broken today.
10:24 This door sound tho
That color is very fitting to that car. What is it?
I wish Kia would build a sedan with this beautiful style.  Their level of luxury is more than sufficient for me.
Why would people even buy this car? The 30k Hyundai genesis got better features and luxury lmao
0:38 Waiting for the centenario
The front license plate frame in place is a travesty to this car's styling. Gorgeous nonetheless 😍
Are the rich people ok?
Seriously, Doug. Get a room.
Doug the lagonda reseller
Pretty sure Doug got paid to do this review...
the matte paint has doug's fingerprints all over it
I work for aston martin and I've ever only seen 1 😅
"10" for styling? Blinded either by the price or the brand name (or both). Backward tach in this car: "...neat look...distinctive..." Curious to hear his comments on the reverse tachometer dial in the new Genesis ("What were they thinking?")
This car has never really been worth 1 million  USD. Aston wanted to finesse some rich Arabs
Can't wait for the Centenario
Honestly, I don't like the styling at all. I'd give a 6/10. Sorry Doug.
Aston Martin can’t even make their own engines 😴
A Rolls still looks and feels more luxurious than that car, a little disappointing, to say the least, the car looks about the same level of a fully-loaded Mercedes S class in the interior and a fully loaded Honda Accord on the outside, but no more or less. Limited production was the reason of the price but definitely not the car itself.
That lambo tho😩😩😩
Calling it rn this ones gonna get a couple million views
This car is way to expensive.... ugly paintjob plastic rear view mirror... ugly back pilar...ugly lether sitbelt way to make it sutle... 250.000 is more apropriate price for it.
The red leds of a 2009 passat turns to orange only on the outher part. How come someone like Doug think something so simple is impressive on otherwise a very intresting car.
Who would have thought that the Rolls Royce Phantom could be considered "Bang for your buck" when compared to this.
#perfection
So... How much does this car cost? He didn't say it.
Lagonda is clearly the most ridiculus  automotive brand ever.
I felt robbed with his tail light description... - But look at this, it turns orange!!!! Only half of it!!!! -    :|
Nice V12 Taurus
E38 still reigns supreme. This Lagonda is a joke.
Taraf means luxurious in Arabic  Taraf= ترف
$1M at Aston Martin buys you Ford's sloppy seconds.
Looks like genesis
I still prefer rolls Royce
This car looks so fucking ugly, Jesus Christ... the front end looks like a Ford Fusion, and the wheels look like they were ripped off from a Dodge Charger... if this looked more like the previous Aston Martin Vantage or you know... the actually very good looking Rapide, you can SORT OF justify the price.   A BMW 340i looks more expensive than this abomination...
So they only put heated seats in the back in a milion dollar car made specifically for middle east...where there is never winter.
I just spent 40 dollar for a very nice brasilian hooker and nowe i go home in my 8000 dollar chevy camaro.   I am very happy.
Lagonda.....proof that you have a great car company with poor naming capabilities.  Monza and Honda had a baby....
250k is the most this car should be priced.  I expected Maybach levels of styling and customization.  It's a nice car but not even worth 500k.
Holy a centenario review coming 😭😭
This is super car.
All orange interior sucks
My Honda Accord has the same gage cluster
"Ford Taurus" like Lagonda Taraf - good analogy.
"The most beautiful sedan" ......unsubscribed
This is one of the most beautiful cars I have ever seen 🚗👌
$1 million Hyundai Sonata limited. Cool but a bit overpriced. First thing to break is the little speakers mechanism when you turn the car on. 😂😂😂
I don't think any car has ever made me this angry - this might just be one of the biggest rip-offs in the car industry in like... the history of cars. Starting with the Ford turn signal stock, the uncovered fridge audaciously protruding  into the trunk area, the Garmin (!!) navigation system, the lack of a glass or sunroof, the aftermarket-looking rims, the general interior that's straight out of any Aston Martin, the iPads in the rear. Yeah, it's beautiful but still - if you bought one of these you gotta reevaluate your priorities, man.
I bet even your farts smell luxurious in that car!
The worlds most expensive luxury sedan, in primer.
Doug is the type of guy to fart in the car and keep the windows up
And next up we move on to me kneeling on the ground
stupid car...you are just desperately trying to justify the price....
the front end looks like a ford taurus
No one can compete with the Rolls Royce .. it’s just like the pyramids built by Alien !
how often do you say lagonda in the video ? wtf
This lad calling a piston a 'hydraulic'
Get a Daewoo Leganza I believe it's called instead, probably better sterio and infotainment center 😆. Then use the million plus left over for a house and.. dinner 😉
Reviews a million dollar car But Doug's clothes are from a dollar store....noice
A million for that car, no way 😐 😂
Doug: The most beautiful sedan ever made Chris Harris: As the world becomes richer, the rich people become more tasteless.  He said that when reviewing the Rolls Royce Cullinan, but it also applies here 100%
It’s not ugly but not beautiful, looks a lot like a Ford Taurus (the newer ones) or like a long Ford Fusion or a Honda Accord.
After seeing the video I think it’s fair to use Doug’s LX570 title to name it: Lagonda Taraf is a one million dollar disappointment
How is this luxury vehicle? I'd chose A45 Mercedes any day
Doug says "The best four door car I have ever seen." Doug, have you never seen a 1991 Buick Roadmaster wagon?
Daddy Doug keeps calling the broguing on the seats ‘circle pattern’. Plssssssss
Wow the wheels on a car so expensive should look better the that. They look like they're for a honda accord.
Kinda looks like an expensive accord up front
I thought it would be more exciting. I’d take a RR over this any day
The word “Taraf” in Arabic means “luxury “
*Dr. Evil Intensifies*
Is it just me or does it kinda look like a 2020 Honda Accord?
Only British can copy BMW and sell it for a Million. And it’s ok
This isn’t worth a 9/10 cool factor lol showing a lil bias there
looks like a honda accord
Compare this to Pagani at the price and it’s like comparing the Pagani to a $40k Genesis
Love this car.
I'm just wondering for how long will CarsAndBids be his ,,new,, website
Take the styling from this and put the interior of the Phantom in it, WOW!!!
Sorry, but it's car for rich dummy's. May be it have sence for collections, but as a luxury car it worse RR's, Bentley's, MB S-klass, BMW 7, Audi A8, Lexus LS. That's why they focused on middle east. Guys there buying every limited car (expansive car) - it's investment (nothing common good cars)).
Aston Martin be like "Hey lets make a luxury car thats worth 150k and only sell it to rich middle eastern princes who will pay 1 million for it"
It doesn't look as beautiful as he described, it's just unique
Cant wait to see the review of the centinaro
Made for the Arabic market..... but has bottle cooler??  Makes sense.... lol I'm sure they've all sold though.  And while the price may seem steep,  material costs are astronomical in small production numbers. I'm not justifying the FULL price tag, there's profit margin built in obviously, but in order to make sure every piece is made that little bit better, all around the car, IS expensive.
Overpriced scam
The front looks like my $28000 Mazda 3 with a longer hood
One million dollars is just unjustifiable for this car. It's absurd. You can buy a Phantom, a Mulsanne and a Maybach S Class for this amount of money.  People with too much money are so easily manipulated. Yeah, they don't care, I know. But logically, this is absolutely crazy.
Hoovies garage will buy a Lagonda for $20,000 in five years
Basically it has the same light features as a VW golf🤷🏽‍♂️ It also kind of reminds me of a VW arteon from the front.  How is this car the most beautiful 4 door? I don't see it. Basically a piece of junk for a million. Aston Martin taking advantage of tasteless billionaires.
Wel I think the most beautiful sedan ever is the "banana shaped" Mercedes CLS W219. As well as the cocoon shaped interior. But this Ford is nice. But not as sleek.
Don Huayra has one in Mexico city
No apple play complicated Bluetooth shit navigation to many things I don’t like but I’d throw a mill at it and slam this John end up stickin it in a beautiful garage
No adjustable head rest in a 1 million dollar car!!!!! Great AM
Is it just me or does the front grill look like a 10th honda accord? 🤔
The headlights and the front lines look a bit like BMW i8. BMW was inspired by it I guess.
It must be such a great car if they're paying him to sell it so shamelessly
This is a Rip-off. Million? I get +200k but 1M? No Id rather get a Bentley or Rolls-Royce
Looks like 80k
The interior looks like 2003
I wonder what they put on the fridge in the Middle East, since they don't really drink alcohol there.
The car DOES NOT justify the price tag for me XD
Yay! Go Doug! Finally! You said "for sale!" Not "on sale"! Proud of you!
I can’t believe this is the most expensive sedan ever made, because I always thought that honor would go to the Phantom. This is probably also the most beautiful sedan ever made. I can’t believe this is a production car because it looks too much like a concept car!
doug, my tesla model 3 also has a glass panel between front and rear doors... its where the front facing cameras are located... not so impressive on a car costing $1 mil.
Catch me paying 1 mil for a car that looks like a current gen Accord lmao
What a stupid car
1 million dollars, apparently the most "beautiful" sedan and yet they didn't bother hiding that ugly doorlock.. overrated is an underrated word to describe this car..
It feels like the dealership called up Doug and said help us sell this vehicle and we’ll split the commission on it. Having watched majority of Doug’s videos, this one just didn’t seem honest to me.  Just weird....
Car is ugly!!!
Literally you are buying leather seats with nice sketches in 1m$... GREAT DEAL👌 Not surprised why it's made ONLY  for Arabs!!!
I have a feeling hoovie is gonna own this car in 2057
Ford Fusion Limo
This car is trash, the only good thing about it is that it is limited and the key is nice
A $1M Aston Martin or Lagonda is being inspected by a guy named Phil?  At that price it should be inspected by someone named Duke Donald Ferlys Wilson Baden-Powell.  No slumming on these Lagonda inspectors or you'll find it difficult to find people willing to buy them.
Dat Centenario tho
Thiiissss, is how many people that are going to vote for Trump  👇
The iPad clips look like something a soccer mom would have in her 2009 Honda Odyssey. Trash 🗑
Unsubscribing after so many reviews dude. U got sold to a company.
The back half of the car looks a lot like the Saab 9-5, but I don’t consider that a bad thing at all
Maybe I’m supposed to just know, but what year is this car from?
Looks like a honda accord from the front and a jaguar from the back.
I wouldn’t pay a dime over 50k for this car.
My jaguar xjl has that same color interior, London tan.  Please redo your jaguar xjl review. And try and find a very high optioned, non black interior model.
No power close trunk???? For 1,000,000!!!
Price tag of a million dollars for this??!..... Totally unjustified.... There are vehicles less than half the price that have way more luxurious interiors than this...
It looks like a car out of GTA 5. I wouldn’t spend a penny on it.
Looks like a Hyundai concept car.
That ashtray isn’t just an “accessory” arabs really do smoke a lot and in the Middle East we have people that fill up the car for us while we wait in it so they chose the cape-less system so that the fuel stop employees don’t put the fuel cap on your paint and scratch it
I think the car looks real nice ,but I can't help thinking of the KIA STINGER has a similar look I hate the MATT paint ,as for the interior looks real nice but doesn't look as good a a BENTLEY MULSANNE interior .
Doug's new hair🔥
Is Doug one of the most annoying Youtube presenters of all time?
Astons Big Brain idea.. offer heated seats for a car meant for the Middle East. Excellent.
Love the Ford Fiesta front grille 🙊
unlike the rapide it actually has its own sedan styling rather then looking like a stretched version of the sports car, truly stunning when you see it in person.
Quite an embarrassing car for 1 million...
Most overpriced car ever made
Directed to a market that has more money than sense!
If it's from the Arabic ترف Then it's pronounced "Ta-ruf" very quick No Taaaraaaf 😅
I feel like Doug is trying to help sell the car instead of giving a fair review.
That isn’t that beautiful. It looks like a Ford.
This is just shit a car
I appreciate all the leather they use, but other than that.... uhhhh any German full size sedan would whoop that any day.
I can't find that video with the Lamborghini
I'll give this garbage 28k new
>1 million dollars >bolts gas strut to sill instead of hiding it in jamb
This was an ad for the Lagonda. It wasn't a review.  There must be some reason for this
The rear end is ugly from side for me.
To be honest, the Lagonda Taraf may be one of those beautiful cars that doesn't show well on camera, but I agree with you that it is "distinctive". And as always, thank you again Doug, for helping me see the upside of being a man of modest means.
The front and rear lights look similar to the modern NSX or is that just me??
Now that's a unique car with corks and features!
He def got payed to review this and try and sell it cause no one was buying. Lol 1 mil u kidding me bruhhh
Looks like an over priced Accord based on that front face.
This is one ugly sedan given the money
Don't look like a million dollars car.....
i dont know about that front end & that Gage cluster looks like it is out of a 1999 vehicle.
I love how he always teases his next car he's gonna review during the cars and bids Ad section. With that said I'm hyped for the centenario review
I’m sorry but if I’m going to spend a million $’s on a car, I might as well get a Bugatti!!
Does that thing have halogen running lights? In a million dollar car?
Cars like this are exactly why I subscribed to Doug
I can't watch it till the end. You basicly pay for cool outside look and leather interior which is full of crappy plastic from Rapid. A piece of shit for 1mln$. Nicely done AM.
First look ? Ford Fusion ;)
I googled the VIN. Looks like it was imported from Belgium.
Did Doug seriously just call 1 inch of headroom impressive? I get that he’s tall, but he gets that much headroom in most Ferrari’s
This reminds me a bit too much of a Maybach 62. Not in the looks, but in a brand trying a bit too hard to swing above its weight class. It is indeed a looker, but there's still too much baggage from the lesser model it's based on. A Veyron also cost a million, but it had a bespoke drivetrain and zero Golf/Jetta turn signal stalks.
Front look like Honda Accord
that is the most overpriced piece of automobile i have ever seen. its not even a competitor for the s class  maybach
Looks like a dodge challenger.  Same wheels I think :)
the 2013 porsche panamera had those hydraulic hinges.  I loved it!
Some people in the comment section completely missing the point. Of course this isn’t a objectively better. An RR or a Bentley is superior in every way, but it’s meant for people who ALREADY own an RR or a Bentley.  It’s a car from a small manufacturer who wants to make some extra profit. Aston doesn’t have the backing of giants like BMW or VW (RR and Bentley parent companies respectively) so it cannot beat their offerings head on. It’s a subjective choice, a part of your collection to flex in your monthly oil well owners club meeting.
Not worth a million dollar. Ugly back seat tv monitor placing. 😂
all that styling for the front to look like an accord lmao
What happened to your knee?!?!
If a Lagonda has 66/100 on Doug’s score, can you imagine Doug giving a score for your Car? Holly Sh...
Literally a million bucks for this outdated piece of crap...typical aston..a Rolls will run circles around this all day
Unpopular opinion: has to be one of the worst looking cars. Looks like they didnt finish it. And a million dollars and you get plastidip looking paint  So you get a matt black rapide?  No thanks ill happily take a new toyota crown
People are CRAZY- this is a truly BEAUTIFUL car- i don't know what people are on about...
A very expensive ford fusion 😬🤦‍♂️
Wow it looks cool but everything else was very unimpressive. Especially for 2018!
This car is just a joke. The interior look like 90s car lol. Maybe for old rich people haha
This is the first time for me, that i start dreaming about a sedan, that i can’t afford. I have a GLC 63s as Daily, and i was happy since today. Damn u Doug for showing me this Car.
Why does the front remind me of a Ford Taurus
Rolls is definitely better imo
$1mil and not even a sunroof oh man I really have to laugh..
Turd rough
"Like other Aston Martins from this era"...arent we still in 2018's era?
Tavarish is somewhere in Florida sesrching for one that's been destroyed.
Dodge Challenger V6 rims, honda accord/ford fusion front, and garbage rear. doug please tell me you’re kidding
This is 100% not worth 1,000,000.... It's definitely nice but not for that price. Would certainly prefer the new Bentley Mulssane or Rolls Royce. The technology on the Taraf is sooooon far behind everything it's actually surprising
Interior has less room than my BMW GT550. Geez
The most insipid color I've ever seen
Centenario video coming next 🔥
Doug, what single car currently has the highest ratio of Doug Score points to market price in dollars?  Is it the best car?
Are you high bro? This looks like a fancy for fusion!
Apart from having one of the most annoying voices on YouTube, he keeps saying "LagAnda"  rather than "LagOnda".
You'd think that with this pricetag they could afford a full paint job...
Doug after seeing suzuki mehran in pakistan. ''I was terribly mistaken about the astin martin Lagonda Taraf that it was the best looking 4 door car I have ever reviewed.''
Id rather have one phantom
So let me get this straight... I pay you $1mil, and you give me turn signals that light up? I'll take it! But please leave those stupid hydraulic arms off. I don't want to trip when I drunkenly fall out of my car. I'm rich, I drink. don't judge me!
-Dispatch- How many suspects in the vehicle?  -Officer- One suspect. Suspect is now spreading all over the back seats!😂
Cheval Fugitive
I love it when Doug moves the door and says it stays in place and it never does. Made me chuckle in a few of his videos !
3x more expensive than a Rolls  Not 3x better.
Something weird at the back....
I'd rather buy a Lexus LS an LC500 and a nice house for the money
Great video per usual Doug, it’s really cool watching a “regular” guy get to review some of these ultra rare luxury vehicles
For 1 mil surely the rear seats should recline ... looks like an S class is roomier &  comfier in the back to me
If you debadged this, I would have never ever guessed this was a Lagonda/Aston Martin. When I saw a sneek peek of it, I thought it was some wierd luxury sport sedan from a company I have never heard of. This car is insane.
I honestly don’t like this car tbh
Re nav system: "...that's all they had at the time." Pretty chintzy, $1M and they couldn't throw a 3rd iPad in there and have it reworked to be proprietary, as well as control the climate and give metrics etc. Plus pulling parts from other cars, a ford no less, are just more indications they're fleecing the wealthy. Along with no auto opening and closing doors, hood/bonnet, trunk/boot is ridiculous. Bottle cooler but no custom flutes? Doug makes it seem like 2018 was eons ago so we should forgive the glaring lack of tech and features available in cars at 1/3 of the price. That rear climate control is laughable, a 2.5" dot matrix screen?!?! plus that large blank panel? No touch controls? No sunroof? "Paying for rarity" ??? It's essentially a state of the art 2005 vehicle at best. The rear iPads are just sad. $1M and they couldn't have 10 tech school grads to work for a couple weeks to make custom screens and os? Gtfoh!
Kind of fugly
Why don't you tell us how much this dealership is charging for this used car?
In India phantom cost about 1.4 million $
This is garbage on 4 wheels at the price. Sheesh.
The most underwhelming million dollar car i have ever laid eyes on
That front fascia has similar features to a 2017+ Honda Accord.  Wild.
Thats an expensive Mondeo
Doug the type of guy to kneel on cold hard cement with his bare knee while reviewing a car
A used 2018 90k $ S class is waay better than this boring crap.
Hi can u please pronounce it correctly, in Arabic it taraf not toraf
I am most surprised that I have seriously never heard of this car before.
First of all the word ترف is pronounced (taraf) not (turaaaaaf) which was so annoying to hear throughout the entire review 😅 Secondly this car deserve to be in the price range of 200k to 300k dollars , it doesn't pay for the 1 million dollar price tag not even the ugly design with the cheap looking wheels and brake calipers
If doug never said how much it costs and you asked me what I thought it costs at the end of the video, I would have said 200K MAX.  This car is no where near a rolls royce or bently and this is coming from a person that respects aston martin.  The price tag is not even close to being justifiable.
this car is like a gta5 car
My Subaru's infotainment system is much more luxurious than this Aston martin .... I mean L A G O N D A
Taste is everything....and if I had a million to spend on a ride, there is a .0001% chance I buy one of the 120.  It's nice, but I'd spend my money elsewhere. Damn Doug...that car is basically brand new!  "Call for price" on the Ogara website.
10/10 styling? I think it's pretty bland, personally.
strandman be like: ok i have 1 mill lets not get a buggati or p1 lets get this
A million dollar without even a small sunroof
1:00 And now we know we have a centinario in our future.
Hyped for the chentenario review
This car is hideous... inside looks outdated for a modern can, ugly outside... no way this car worth 1M US$... Doug needs glasses... a mercedes s class is way better and cheaper
This has scatpack wheels 🤣
Turnsignal on the side integrated into some sort of gill: BMW Z4 mk I Turnsignal at front taking the place of a running light: VW Golf mk VII  As you can see, all very distinctive!
This car looks and is meh, I was expecting more from a million dollar car...the interior doesn't reflect the money nor the design
Even if I was a millionaire I wouldn’t buy this car. It’s not worth it. You can get all these luxury features on Mercedes, BMW etc.
Morons bought this
this car has the exact same front as a 2018 honda accord
It is a genesis g90 rip off
This car is absolutely hideous I wouldn’t buy it for $30,000.
Worst way to spend a million dollar on a car.
These cars seem so random like totally not worth it.. idk just not appealing to me lol
Looks like a car from Grand Theft Auto 3 which is 15 years old
Outrageous price.
$1000000 rip off
Ngl I thought it was a Saab in the thumbnail
it looks like a ford interceptor, honestly ford is more appealing.
$1M and no USB-C in the rear seats?!  *D I S G U S T I N G*  0/10
1 million and you get colorless screens in front, wow.
This all looks a little low rent compared to the Bentley Continental GT, and you could have the Bentley in five different colours for the price of this car.
Someone: is that Honda Accord ? Me: I believe so...
Nice car...you got a grandma body thou.
This car is so NOT beautiful.. and especially not worth the price NEVER worth the price tag of $ 1 000 000 .. Tbh I’m triggered by this car..  And the interior is sooo outdated wauw.
If this car sold for 60 grand, all the "luxurious" features would be called as "silly quirks" or "funny things" by Doug. He's basically trying to justify the million dollar price tag. And I don't see a point in it. This is an ugly car with such trash features. A mid spec Maybach is much better than this piece of shit
Hey Doug , get drake to give you his Mercedes Vision coupe.
*Looks a bit like a Mustang. ...Oh and please line up the umbrella holder strap. :-|*
Nothing special honestly
they made a new animal looking car that looks like a car from a cheap game with not real cars
the way the car looks reminds me of when you’re writing and the pencil lead falls out
The grill kinda looks like the Honda Accord new models 😂😂😂😂😂
1 million dollars and ipad clips??????? Really?? No bespoke infotainment system??? At least put a built in charger onto those clips and install lagonda apps that connect automatically to the car infotainment system via bluetooth.
I don't understand why people expect this to be competitively priced when there's only going to be 120 of them for the foreseeable future. They obviously don't exist to be competitive in the segment.
that Centenario Roadster ist just hot 🔥
Famous starting words for most every drive:  "I have always wanted to drive..."
1 million dollars? Aston Martin is trying to pull a fast one with this...
I get that it's priced because of exclusivity but that interior simply isn't good enough
Isn't this the brand that sold cars with shit transmissions that they would swap out by shipping your car to England....and charge you a huge wad of cash to do it?
UGLYYYYYYYYYYYY CAR 😌
Looks like a Chrysler...come on man!
Hey doug when are you doing the centanario review
Payment is quite reasonable on one....million.....dollars at 3% over five years.  Only $18K/month.
Someone please buy Doug some knee pads 😅
It doesn't look most expensive
9:14 When the car looks so stunning so you going on your knees to pay respect.
How do you identify an idiot with $1mln.? You make an ugly car with leather and put a $1mil sticker price. Why? Profit!
I get exclusivity, but this car isn’t worth than $200k at best.  It’s definitely not nicer than an Rolls Royce.  Think about how many nicer cars that you could buy with $1million.
After seeing that Garmin satnav, had to double check if this was really a 2018 model and not 2008
This doesn't feel or look like a million dollars. The Cadillac CT6-V Blackwing looks so much better and got more features.
Truly breathtakingly beautiful. The rear door strut is such a great, yet simple idea. Cool key insert. Thank you for taking us through this great car.  How many full-size sedans have paddle shifters?
looks like michael's car from gta v
The most overpriced car
A friend from our car group had a Rapide for a few years, and it’s truly one of the coolest cars I’ve ever experienced. We took a 160 mile road trip with 4 adults and we were all super comfortable. I can only imagine how extra good the Taraf is in comparison, especially considering the rear seating area is more spacious. I don’t know about a million dollars more good, but still rad.
I have to disagree. It’s not beautiful. To me, it looks like a car designed for Grand Theft Auto V …
Everything is supposed to be perfect and covered and yet every ower has look at those ugly child anker logos on the seats...
Just a reminder that Canada is also part of North America and we use KPH. :)
It looks great but not a million dollars great
"...and, here, in the trunk... Where you'd *least expect it*... Aston Martin, or ~*Lagonda*~ has sewn $480,000 worth of cash... *YES, CASH*... into the leather. And *they* call it... "The '*justification*'. That might seem weird, but that's what you get with a... ~*Lagonda*~ Taraf."
Wait, so if there is enough space to make the back of the roof higher... Why not make the whole thing higher?
I might be crucified for this comment, but the front in particular reminds me a lot of the Peugeot 508. It's not really all that striking.
Its a longer 2010 Rapide.  I can’t believe how much this thing is lacking for that ridiculous price tag.  I get that it is limited and all but I wish it was at least on par with something like a flagship Bentley which is half the price.
Doug: "The door will stay exactly where you put it no matter where you put it"  Door: moves every time.
The rear turn signal is like the Euro-spec first generation VW Phaeton.
I think it's longer,  lower,  sleeker than any Merc, Rolls, or Bentley.  I think it's beautiful.  Still not worth much.
Common by a Maserati 4 Porte
That’s one expensive Mazda 3
ي عيال ذا يسوق امها يقول كلمه تراف معناها الفخمه ورفاهيه  بلعربي😂😂😂😂
Total garbage for 1 million  And best looking car for doug😂😂😂😂
Drink every time Doug says “Lagonda”, “Taraf” or “Lagonda Taraf” 🍺
A luxury sub-brand from a luxury brand. Yeah why the f... not?
Better buying rolls Royse 🙄
If this car had the G-wagen door slam, it would be perfect.
Not at all worth a million dollars
I've never heard of this car before. It reminds me of the concept retro BMW 3 which similarly the rear volume reminds me of a bathtub. They seem to have originated when we all wondered what modern cars would look like but in a retro design.
"Lagonda is Aston Martin's luxury brand" sounds kinda redundant to me.
Doug: "You won't find any Aston Martin logos anywhere throughout the vehicle" *Opens the radio display, Aston Martin right there Doug: Quickly changes the screen
"They only made 100 cars for the entire planet*"  *Entire planet being the UAE  also for everyone saying it's not worth a million dollars, of course it isn't, but if you were selling a car targeted exclusively at arabian oil princes and playboys, would you not rip them off?
You are out of your mind if u buy this and not a Rolls-Royce. Doug looks like he is forcing it. *2xRolls-Royce
This thing looks like a generic car from GTA5. Priced like one too.
I mean if I’m going to be honest, it looks like a gorgeous car but I would rather buy a Bentley or Rolls that is just as nice imo. Doesn’t really look like a car worth a million bucks to me.
Front end looks like a ford mondeo mk5
I guarantee that door hydraulic costs more than my entire car.
How the freak you are gonna give it a 10/10 and the P1 not ?????  Doug..  I love you, I love your videos, but sometimes you cross the line.  Just kidding but men HOW ???
Almost 3.5 minutes of introduction. Come on Doug we're here for the quirks just get straight to them
Styling 10/10. Value 6/10. Seriously Doug?
its clearly for middle east. europeans would consider this ugly and tasteless. those units sold in europe clearly went to.same middle est nationals
1 mil and does not come with tinted windows.
It would look alot better if it was pillarless, I would guess most people would agree. If you do, drop a f for this and never forget Harambe. He will always live on in our 💕.
This car isnt that beautiful. It looks like something from GTA V
Review the centenario
It's ugly,weird, overpriced and outdated.... Just like the old Lagonda! This is the perfect successor!
Yea this car isn’t worth a million bucks maybe Bentley price but I would deff take a rolls over this everyday of the week and twice on Sunday
Nothing about the panel gap on the doors?
Body not all that far from a Genesis G70. For a mil, I'd rather buy that, an 812 Superfast and a $600K house.
The one expensive car in gta no one buys because meh...         Don’t be mad boys, he’s young, and he needs the money. Enjoy your check Doug it must’ve been good :D no front
My million dollars is "in back".
Taraf means side or party or faction in various languages. Some claim on line is that in Arabic it means “ultimate luxury” but elsewhere it says it means side, etc. in Hindi or Turkish or Arabic...
Doug’s the only person who reviews a million dollar car with unkempt hair...dude looks he just woke up lmfaoo
Doug I hope seeing that blue Centenario means you’re going to review it some time soon
I'm not trying to be a hater, but I don't understand the "beauty" of this car, and why Doug thinks it's so beautiful.  No mention of the ugly silver key hole that's next to those door handles.  I almost always agree with Doug on his comments, but this one he is on his own.   I would not really care if I did ever see one on the road tbh.  The driver can sneer at me all he wants, but I'll be the one laughing at him/her for spending $1M on such an average Aston Martin.
It has the but of a Dodge Challenger, front of a Dodge Charger and profile center of a Kia Optima. I agree with whoever said it’s worth less than 100k
yesss, thank you Doug.
so a million dollars for a common aston martin with 4 doors and a FORD indicator stalk? pathetically overpriced. They really made a quick buck of this car
This car looks like a ford fusion mixed with a 2018 chevy impala wtf
Ford Taurus Lagonda Taraf 😂😂😂
Doug:"Probably one of the most beautiful 4 door car of all time" Me:*laughs in 94 Corrolla*
I guess the only thing better than the Royce is the key fob,lol
Million dollar car doesn’t even have sunroof or cameras features?  Like what ? 🤷🏾‍♂️
Thisss, is the most overpriced car ever made
"So your kids in the back won't be bored while you're driving along" Ah yes, this million dollars car interior is really boring, I feel the undeniable need for an iPad
The market for this is people that get a diamond encrusted iphone, or gold toilet, not a good value just a flex. thats it.
My end of the street neighbor has one in almost exact spec, in real life looks like a Genesis
History has been made. Daddy Doug has given out a 10/10 score
TARAF MANELE
Didn't notice the trunk button was a Taraf outline??? Come on Doug!
How is that a million????
its not limited doug that car sucked for 1mil so they could  not fool more people than 125
The best thing about styling of this car is that in the same time it is insanely beautiful AND incredibly subtle. BTW oil sheiks do not give a crap if it is not the best value, important this is that your sheik neighbor doesn't have one.
This the best https://youtu.be/ivf4080ywE0
That's a pretty cool Hyundai Genesis
Thisssssss is another car that you will get hyped about and search up on auto trader
Imagine buying this car and being constantly told "Hey nice Rapide".
And that's why luxury tarafs sucks balls.
"....middle east, where there's a specific demands"   The life of the rich and the tasteless
This is the single worst way to spend one million dollars on one car.
There is no way it cost 1 million......
Manny koshbins next video I bought a Aston Martin lagonda
I agree with Doug on the styling honestly, I love the way this car looks. But there is no way in hell this car's price tag can be justified. Exclusivity means nothing when you get the same features in BMW's, Mercedes and Audi's. If the performance was top notch I'd maybe understand the price, but even then a lot of cars at the 150k price range do everything better than this one does besides arguably styling
Did Doug use a grass strimmer to cut his hair?
Best looking 4 door car!? WTF!? It looks too long, it's streched! It's literally one inch from having an ugly silhouette. Yes, the Lights are nice, but the Overall Shape... Puh ... In that size class, I'll take the RR Phantom as most beautiful. Overall: BMW E38 (standard, not the long version)
I have always firmly believed that the 2018 Honda Accord copied/took inspiration from the grill of this car
A million dollars luxury sedan with no adjustable headrests. Looks fab though
That's a damn unusual looking sedan Gotta be a Lagonda fan If you are worried about depreciation You have no appreciation of the situation It's called the Taraf It's a bit of a laugh but it's got some class Aston taking names n kicking ass
This car would be perfect without the b pillar
This review contains zero justifications for the price point.
Holy fuck...Centenario is the next one :O
I just love this cars and bids ad spot because I know what cars are gonna be reviewed next.
I like how 1 million gets you the "sport" wheels of KIA or Hyundai SUV
I really really don't like the stying. In my opinion the bonnet is too long and the front glass panel is too flat. I don't like the grill and the headlights. And I don't understand why he found the headlights that special. It doesn't even have dynamic headlights like literally any Audi since 2015. I mean this car is from 2018 and has the most ridiculous infotainment system I have ever seen and IT COST 1 MILLION DOLLARS... Just get a Maybach S650 or a Phantom and you will get a faster, more luxurious(for driver and rear passengers), lower maintenance costs, faster and overall better car and in my opinion the s class looks so much better.  And for the rest of the money I would buy an SLS AMG BS... Man I really get triggered...
I tought it was a polestar from the side view and thumbnail
A million bucks and you can see bolts and cheap thin metal in the grill  not to mention the radiator you would think for that money you would get one of those powered grills that hide everything and only open when needed not to mention a measly 530 hp out of a 12 cilinder 6.0 engine again 1 MILLION DOLLARS!
I dont like it look like a big ford focus
14:00 If i had kids I wouldn't let them live even in the same house as this car. They wouldn't be able to get their grubby playdough hands anywhere near it.
Not even painted for a million 🤔
So this million dollar isn't equipped with a sunroof  ? For real ?
and speaking of the ceiling, it doesn't have a sunroof. You pay 1 million dollars and don't even get a sunroof
Aston Martin went back to the 1970s when the Lagonda first came out, but have modernized it with a better engine and transmission, unlike the first Lagonda in the 1970s.
This looks like a charger
The little holes pattern on the seat's upholstery are called "perfings", and together are called "brogue" or "brogueing"; those are terms from the shoemaking world, btw. This is the classic type or brogueing you commonly find in brogue styled shoes. An adornment that was most likely born in northern Britain a few centuries ago and was made popular in North America in the mid 20th c. due to gunboat longwing style shoes, which featured prominent perfing all over. This, of course, does not help to justify the $1M price tag. Then again, most of that money does not reflect on materials/engineering, but on the status owning this car provides, just as Doug suggested, only that more subtledly.
24:10 You should've put up the arm rest on the backseat, now you're looking at the plain black plastic hole, but eh, better luck next time :P Also, i'm honestly not impressed with this car, i don't share the same love for the design, not that i've got great taste, because i'm looking forward to the video of that Lamborghini you were standing with in the CarsAndBids promo.
I would pay $74,624 for this and a warranty
No thanks...this car does not hold up, in my opinion.
Everything looks cheap, and the front looks like Ford Fusion.
Looks like a very generic American muscle car with 4 doors. It honestly reminds me of a vehicle from GTA
Most expensive and most beautiful garbage bag in my opinion
Drool 😘
Spare me Doug, it looks like a Hyundai Genesis.   Give me a break!!!!
Hey Doug .. Review some Indian manufactured cars too, they are weird, they are cool.. India is one of the big markets..  The way you review cars, does make a lot of sense.. And I m you fan 😍 . Love from INDIA 🇮🇳
Doug need knee pads
This has to be the most overpriced car in history
this car is there so aston can grab some of that arabic oil money by selling them overpriced pieces of shit.
the ugliest one million
Can't believe you actually got your hands on one - awesome review Doug!
Looks like a Dodge Charger from the back when the taillights are on.  Certainly worth 1 million dollars, 😆
How to waste a million dollars ...
Dare I say, Centenario review coming soon?!?!
I wonder what doug weighs?
1 million and it looks like shit. seriously this could've been much nicer. I don't like the shape at all. the back looks very wonky
Total worthless car ever made , even front quarter panel doesn't match with front bumper..  clearly saw from 2.11 and onward. Paid review. Even some people avoid to buy it for half million 🤣🤣
Beautiful car, I’ve always loved the styling but... It has the same infotainment system from a used $3,000 2003 XC90! I love Volvos, A LOT, but anybody who wants to pay $1,000,000 should be getting better tech than even a good car from 17 years ago!
lol
What a ripped off.. I do feel scammed if I bought one of these.
I could get  green card for 1 million bucks or an Aston Martin.
Lovely video as always. It was mentioned that the transmission was smooth for a single clutch system, but I think Taraf had an 8 speed ZF automatic unit.
long ford
What is Doug smoking? This thing manages to look both bland AND fugly
Is this video sponsored by Aston Martin or something? This one is really biased lol
Honestly this is does not look as luxurious compared to any RR.. Doug kneels next to the car and is still taller than the car itself! None of the screens are even high definition not even the gear indicator 😹
Meh. It's distinctive but not necessarily attractive. Looks like a Genesis G90. I do love the resurrection of the Lagonda brand. They should have sold the Rapide and the DBX under the Lagonda name.
million dollar luxury car with a significant amount of attention on looks. *Not even an attempt at hiding the keyhole in the door* I guess it isn't hard to rip off middleeastern rich people. If it costs a lot of money surely it must be worth owning.
I'm going to say it - Full Size Ford Fusion styling. Sorry Douglas
13:25 Seatbelt foreskin Seatbelt foreskin
not very attractive, especially in that semi-gloss. i suspect they would have built and sold as many of these as they could, but gave up at about 120.
Who else is exited for centenario review 🤑🤑
I'd rather have a Rolls Royce Phantom. In my opinion it also looks better. This Lagonda looks like the 90s box police car in shape. Very standard.
I’m just here because I like the way he says TARAF!
I will take RR Phantom any day of the week n Everyday!
👋CaaaaRsss n BiDdDsssSsd👋
Pretty Ford Fusion!
Doug would have never made a review like this a couple of years ago. Seems like he's trying to sell an extremely overpriced car.. Doug!!
Who likes this new YouTube update
HORRIBLE CAR
Aston Martin: What are the best looking sport sedans? No one: Ford Fusion, Dodge Charger, and Audi RS7 Aston Martin: let's mix 'em into one and celebrate the achievement also sell all of them to ME ME: Call it Ta-Rough and also what SUV you have? Aston Martin: We have DBX
I am from the middle east and i have never heard of this car 🤣  One more thing  ur pronunciation of the word (TARAF) is wrong  It should be  pronounced like (tough) not like (giraffe)
When you’re trying to be practical so you buy a fully optioned Rolls Royce Phantom instead 🤔
It's not worth 1m$ for sure. Disappointed in this car very bad dude like for one milion they were unable to put a damn screen in the back
Cars and Bids skip button 1:12
Good luck getting parts for this lol
4:46 a million dollars key hole
Looks like genesis car lol for 20k
It's not beautiful. Intended for those with more money than sense.
Lovely review.
This car isn’t close to being worth a million
It looks like a yacht
Looks like a GTA V car. The “Astorini Sport”
Great presentation of the car!
The swan doors have to be one of my favorite things about this car
Why isn't this titled "Worlds most overpriced sedan"?
my laganda don't want none unless you got buns hun
Calling any new car a Lagonda under another marque is like calling a new Ford a Duesenberg or a Studebaker: bizarre and pretentious.  No mention of the original Lagonda marque? Supposedly named for an Native American tribe. What the fictional adventurer and detective Albert Campion drove, and what the television version of him ACTUALLY drove because the makers of the series BOUGHT ONE for the series and sold it after they were done with it.   Sheesh. Do your research, Doug.  Yes, yes, Aston Martin bought the name. Somebody bought or usurped the Bugatti name, too... perverse and disgusting, I think.
awful interior, sorry is my opinion but a genesis g90 or a mercerdes s class is more classy!
I think the thing is, GPS systems are complicated and car companies just source the ones that exist.  If Aston-Martin made one from scratch, it would suck.
Imagine paying £1 million for a DB9
Taraf in Lebanese means side, or ‘ass’ in slang 🙄 Someone lied to Aston...
The Aston Martin One-77 was priced similarly but the Lagonda Taraf's styling is nothing compared to the beauty of the One-77.
When a car like this gets 7/10 in comfort I truly wonder. I'd give a 7/10 to an Audi A6, what is supposed to get a 10 in comfort?
No thanks I’d rather have a massive house than a car
If you search “Aston Martin Ford engine”, you may find out something surprising.
CENTENARIO!!!!!!!!!!! (He posted that a while ago)
That's a loooooooong car
the same trick with e65 doors, but e65 was borne in 2002
For $1M   1.Can control radio from rear - 10$ thing will do for you in normal car 2.Turn Signal - 2020 nobel innovation 3. Navigation- Alien technology 4. Music - popping speaker - tortoise will do the same 5. Opposite tacho meter,  km/ speed meter - reverse fitting shhh dont share this million dollar secret 6. Stitching pattern - Tylor you are tricky 7. Logo - who cares 8. Ash tray - $1 may be less than 9. Small door lock unlock button- woww tesla should learn from this makers, musk they are coming for you. 10. Small trunk fridge with umbrella- tear drops -   and lot more   All comes with loganda symbol every two min interval..
So its basically a Rapide with more room in the back, considering a used rapide can be had for less than 70k I think this is a total rip off
With this price 4 this ugly car  i can buy ROLLS  DOWN , AMG 63 ,  BMW 750 & KIA STINGRAY FOR  DAILY  USE
I'd sooner take two Rolls Royce's over that thing 😂 twice the price and not half the car
$1M car....no sunroof.
That car has the same middle screen for the stereo as my Volvo V50 from 2008 had. /golfclap Lagonda, job well done!
Brah those ipad attachment things at the back looks like something u buy on ebay and put it on ur car. Im surprised there's no built in screen.
You lose $100k driving it off the lot lol.
You can buy this thing after 5 years in just 200k$  .
Doug gotta be getting a kick back on the sale to be verbally blowing this car like this
I love it Doug, it's gorgeous, but why on earth would they use Garmin, and an antiquated system in 2018? That would date the car to early 2000's. The only thing saying it's a much newer car is the design. Great car in any case.
Your S Cargo is for sale, wanna buy it back?
Front looks like a 2020 Accord lol
I'm still thinking that what feature of this car worth for an million dollar ?? 🙄🤔🤔
Cars and Bids ad skip crew check in!
A million dollars? For a complete lack of luxury features and an all-leather interior? Why, because it's rare? It's pretty? That's not enough. Dude, for as low as half the price you can get an insane Rolls-Royce. For the same price it'll cure COVID-19.
Yeah... I’d take 1 Rolls Royce Phantom, 1 G Wagon, 1 M850I, 1 LX570, 1 4 Runner, and 1 Convertible something... if I had $1,000,000 to spend on a car... I wouldn’t get 1 of anything!
The 400k $ is enough for this thing.
Never ever seen an ugly million dollar car like this one.
We all just gonna ignore the centanario in the intro
It’s looks like a Luxury Honda Accord😂😂😂
Got nothing on my honda civic
Wow. Every minute of this video is Doug telling me one more thing that I've already expected and nothing impressive for a luxury car. Every minute in this vídeo is Doug telling that this car doesn't worth half of its price. Would buy two phantoms before buying one of those. lol
I prefer the old one
Cost cutting on a $1M car?  The lower chrome trim on its [Ford] grille is made in 2 pieces, meets in the middle and there is a noticeably not-smooth shut line between the halves.
Great video, lovely car! I havent seen one of these in year (was in London)
The trunk doesn't even close automatically. A million bucks well spend. Btw. the side profile is really ugly imo. Disgustingly ugly tbh. The front and the rear are really nice tho.
anyone know what year these are from?
damn this car from the front is literally a bmw i8 and a ford
*Waits for Dougscore for him to rate it the same number of points as a Kia Soul
@Doug DeMuro 1. you didn't rev it for us to hear how it sounds 2. The trunk/boot should close by the press of a button for that money
You've upgraded your videos resolution. I like it 👍🏿
feel scammed everytime Doug says "Lagooonda"
The door strut thing is From 2002 E65 E66 BMW 7 series. Nothing new
Not even close to being worth the price. *Frivolous world this one is.*
meh
Ah...that distinctive luxury metal - aluminium
Well, now we know where Honda got their headlight design from
The front looks like the new honda accord 🤷🏾‍♂️
boy, I am just not seeing it; it doesn't look that great to me
It looks like a Dodge...
Anyone else noticing something clanking around when he was driving??  Around 24:16...24:24...25:00.....weird...🤔🤔🤔
Hyundai doing big things in 2020 making luxury car that cost less than 28k
This car is so overrated
I mean....it is REALLY a beautiful thing.
I just saw the entire review. So why is this a million dollars?!!! A car for mindless extravagant opulence😞
in my opinion this car is the same as the aston martin cygnet. Its just a heavily overpriced car meant as a quick cash grab to keep aston martin afloat.
I mean... there's a difference between the ultimate luxury sedan and the most expensive sedan. Right?
all the interior buttons are f*** plastic, come on, wtttfff!
The way he enjoys saying And theeeeen I’ll give it a Douuuug Scooore gets me everytime
Phantom is way more better than this idiot 1M$ car. Doug must consider this.
This car is pure nonsense.  Rolls Royce's  and Bentley  are  the best in the car industry
Looks like a Ford from the front and an Accord from the back imo.
I am going to have the word  "luxury" stuck in my head all day!
I know James May'd say the same, This is one of the most useless car.
I prefer the looks of the rapide
Kind of looks like a Ford or Chrysler to me
Doug really trying to sell this the door thing failed twice
Idk man. It's pretty ugly in my humble opinion.
The stearing wheel looks really cheap
Doug: "Very distinctive grill"  Me: Looks at Ford Fusion
“Cars from this era”.... you mean a year and a half ago?
doug you really need to start focusing on the lights more. i could barely properly see a thing about the headlights....
Literally this car is a joke
1 million dollars!!!! no wonder aston martin is going bankrupt
Aint no way i would pay 1 million for this shit
First I was like wooow that car is amazing until he sat in the front. Horrible navigation system can't believe they put that inside a 1million dollars car
This is Bond car.
The only thing I love in this car is looks. Only looks. For the rest of it I would never pay more than 50k.
Highly Overpriced...  Don't know why doug is still appreciating tbis thing.
1M for this ???????????????????
Unbelievable, $ 1 million for a sedan with outdated technology in the interior. Or bye a new Porsche 911 turbo S, a G63 and a Ferrari Roma and still have 600000,- left 😂
Aston Martin should have made this the rapide! This styling but toned down to fit within the rapides price point as the rapide always looked like a stretched db9
Rolls Royce is wayyyy better! This car is definitely not worth $1 million. Not even 300k!
That is nothing price compare with what we pay for luxury cars.
It's a ugly little piece of steel !! 🤧
Car looks like a moving fish
Best looking sedan? what? Are we looking at the same car you are?
is it just me or Doug's mouth is so expressive you can learn english just from looking at him
Taraf is an Arabic word that means luxury, it is a cool car but not 1 miilion dollars cool. I think the front and the rear ends do not talk to each around the C pillar and the design does not flow like Quattro porte
Just me or is that not a good looking car?
Next video: Here's why the Centanario is one of the best Lamborghini ever made
Doug has the knees I wish I had...right on the concrete, amazing
“You can drive it around if you have a million dollars” or if you’re Doug Demuro
“Very distinctive front end” Looks exactly like a Hyundai Elantra
Not enough of features for 1m USD. I'm gonna buy $200 bike much worth it.
This car looks like a matte black Dodge with cheap aftermarket wheels on.
I just hate the way it looks ....but looks are subjective.
Doug With such perfect , Clear , loud and articulate English you should review everything including girls !😂
Damn I'd love to see a review on that centenario.
How is this being sold here? The 25 year rule doesn't apply to the Taraf?  **Edit** Doug was way ahead of me.  The 25 year rule truly doesn't apply to the Taraf!
Doug really flexing on us with these cars that he's about to review in the Cars and Bids ad
Am I the only one that thinks it looks like one of those expensive cars on GTA V?
I was expecting this to be a 150k car lol
Tbh this cars design is actually pretty unique, especially the C pillar, but the "most beautiful" is a little controversial.
The pricing is way off on this one. And I think no other car has as much road presence as a Rolls Royce Phantom. So I don’t get it. I like the Rapide and its depriciation, but this one is nothing more than a ripoff for oil billionaires. It literally sucks. And I’m sure the video doesn’t do justice for it’s in-person looks and dimensions, but in my point of view it’s not even that beautiful.  I don’t like it.
This car is for people who don't know nothing about a car:)
It's horrendous, it looks like a concept honda accord
Three years later you can find these for 450-600k.
1 million new.. now worth 75k after 2 years
Mehhh,  rising speakers are in a Audi A5 aswell.
doug the typa person to walk around his house like a sim
Even though it cost 1m imo I don’t think it’s the most beautiful sedan.
It worth max 150k for me.... even in that year of release. Price tag is just mindblowing
Not with 1mil, the back seat of an RR autobiography is nicer
Anyone else think this car isn’t worth $1 million
Better looking 4-door sedans at a fraction of the price. Citroen DS (and the very rare SM Opera, which may not yet be $1m), for example. Monteverdi 375. '62 and '63 Lincoln Continental.  Maserati Quattroporte first gen and, arguably, second gen.
2018 accord front end
Is it just me, or does the front look kind of like a Honda Accord? And the side profile of a Dodge Challenger.
I actually don't think it's that good looking, looks awkward to me, unless it looks better in real life as is often the case.
The back doesn't match the front and Doug thinks it's the most beautiful car he's ever seen... It's hideous!
The front looks like my Accord
What? I never thought he'd give its look more than a 5. The car looks weird as fuck.
It was just compared with the other Austin Martin, dude it's 1M $... Rarity? Fuck, I'll make custom car instead including various luxury items of different automobiles in 1M$...
I can't believe Doug gave this thing more than 1 in value. I always thought RR and Bentleys are overpriced, but this thing... it puts the other 2 in a category of "Reasonably priced cars"
Review an Audi rs5 V8
Prius looks aesthetic though.,😎
Beautiful? Wtf🤣
One good thing about the Rapide ancestry... spares & parts will only be in the Aston range, not some mega car level of stupid! As long as you request the Rapide part and NOT the Taraf part!!!
Bruh why the centanario in Bugatti colors
Waiting on the Centennario video
Scotty Kilmer was trying to call you out Doug for recommending unreliable cars!!!! Instead of putting his typical donkey face up, he put your face Doug!!!
So a car meant to go to the desert doesn't have cooled seats?
Been waiting for this car. Finally!
does anyone else see this car gorgeous other than Dug?
All that 1Mil spent on the exterior. While the interior is exactly Rapide like that cost 10 times less
Quit with the advert! I want to get my hilarious comment in without even watching the video!
Front looks like a Honda Accord
Can’t wait to buy one in ten years for $120,000
A styling 10? Doug you on crack.
A 1992 saab 900 cab? That car is absolutely worthless in Sweden.
No offense to Doug but this seems like a paid review...
Careful Doug. From a lawyer standpoint. You can’t say “you WILL get the most interest, and most money for your car”
The worst way to spend 1 million dollars should be the name of this car
it looks like a dodge challenger from the back 😭😭😭
Jeremy wud hav said : its a Ford zepher with chrome nose
the back end looks just like the Paragon R from gta 5
Idk who disliked this video but you are living a sad life lol
What? With that money you could buy a new Rolls Royce Wraith, a Ferrari F8 Tributo, a Lamborghini Huracan EVO and still have money to spend on another way cooler car than that.
"The lagonda umbrella has a lagonda emblem that goes in the trunk of the lagonda", more stating of the unbelievably obvious by Doug.
Cool factor a 9? So according to Doug, this 4 door with a station wagon roofline is "cooler" than a Ferrari 812, Hurracan EVO Spyder, 458 Speciale, McLaren 720S, R8 V10 Plus... I stand by my statement, Doug is on crack.
13:19 - Wait... Regulations state that seat belt buckles must be made out of crappy plastic?
Since you mentioned the Arabic, it’s Taraf (very light A sound) not Tarraaf..
looks like a $200,000 car  a 2018 car  with a 1m sticker price... no adaptive cruise control?  7/10 on comfort... for a 1m luxury sedan? jesus.
Where is the centenario review Doug?
Can I put a 2 Liter Coke bottle in the fridge? Otherwise I am not buying this car.
3:38 that was breathtakingly over exaggerated
Why is Doug talking as if everyone is a stupid idiot
no one knows  what its : it should get 7 in Xool Factor
QuirksandFeatures.com
Those tail lights with that chrome piece looks like Honda Odyssey 2019 model but bigger.
The thumbnail pic looks like it should be a Dodge charger.
You should wear gloves before reviewing this Automobile!
I love you, Aston Martin, but this truly is an exercise in ripping off wealthy oil barons.    ...honestly I'm not even that mad.
You just like it because of the price tag
The front looks like a honda accord.  chanage my mind
not really that beautiful .... (id say -- nothing special really) dammit its soooo not worth 1mil but as mentionted - not for us or european markets
Me: Wow what a bland-looking boat of a ca- Doug: -MOST BEAUTIFUL CAR EVER MADE WITH THE MOST IMPRESSIVE, EYE-CATCHING STYLING!!!
When i first saw the thumbnail, i thought it was a Jaaaag
For a million dollars you should never touch a piece of plastic other than the seatbelt. Some of that switchgear is inexcusable.
Lagonda laughing it's ass off selling this car for a million. Maybach has way more for 1/4th it's price
The grill and headlights remind me of a catfish and I can’t unsee that.
It's ugly af
What's the meaning of Taraf?
https://youtu.be/QyxERb96UKA Rare and one off Ferraris
The grille reminds me of the Nissan Maxima ngl
Love it
The preview of an upcoming car that Doug is going to review in the Cars & Bids reminder is my new favorite part of the videos.
Genesis who?
11:50min 1M$ an so much fails in the leather......
15:00 it has the most luxurious interior but why is there a huge black plastic piece for the rear climate control, even the rear climate vents are plastic and cheap looking... Weird because it has leather in the cupholders and it left that plastic piece there, weird.
Aston Martin pulled the biggest heist ever.
Luxury in this context is subjective..
Honda Accord front end
Million dollar car with a pair of dirty knees inside. Cringy to see Doug shifting his weight around.
The ashtray is prolly more expensive than my whole car, ridiculous lol...
Million dollar car with accord headlights
Lmao taraf is no way close to meaning ultimate luxury, the closest thing to that name means butt
why does it look like a genesis g90 from far away
I also thought this Aston Martin was ugly aF!!! Good thing they made so few, I doubt they'd of sold 1000 or more regardless of price. That was the other thing I hated, a million for this. Yeah no thanks.   Still as usual, very informative video Doug👍📼👍
Here's why the Lagonda Taraf is $1,000,000 over priced.
It almost seems like the dealer asked him to praise the car or he wouldn’t be allowed to review other cars...  lol
I loved the original Lagonda as a kid and the modern interpretation of it - in its rarity - has intrigued me even more. Although rare, $1M for it is excessive IMO. I hate the matte paint that seems to mute the beauty of its aesthetic but also wondering if that V12 is AMG-sourced. — A really cool vehicle nevertheless though.
I think the matte paintwork really takes away from the luxury of this car, it just looks crass. I had to look up other colors of this car and it looks so much better in traditional glossy paint. Then again, money can't buy taste, so there's that
what was that Lamborghini
🤦‍♂️
Rich person: I need an umbrella *proceeds to buy a car for its umbrella*
That ashtray is probably worth a golf mk7
Total B.S
Oh how I love to see that russian sertification mark (PCT) on the key. Wonder how many been sold here in Russia
I personally think it’s ugly...I’m glad I don’t have that kind of money so I wouldn’t feel obligated to buy one for clout
For that price you get a Mercedes Maybach S650, an AMG GT Black Series and a G63... and you have still spare money for a kilo of cocaine.
Here's why the Lagonda Taraf is absolutely not worth 1 million dollars
9:40min, porsch panamera have the same thing but electronic, not hydraulic.
Sorry why does it cost 1mil? It doesnt even justify 200k
Two words disappointed, rip-off
I’d rather get a Phantom
I have never been alerted to the existance of this thing
The Audi rs7 is a fraction of the price, has the same sound system, and has a sunroof. Why would you buy this?
It looks like a Ford rental car in the front. Bleh
One Million Dollars! ☝
Many Maserati vibes in design.
Time for Aston Martin to become bankrupt. Honda Accord looks better than this .
Genises.? Hundai
this might be an unpopular opinion but i think this car looks average at best.
This is the kind of car a bond villain owns
A significantly uglier, long wheelbase Rapide, for 5 times the money when new. With the most significant features being: a magnetized leather strap,  a 10 pound gas strut and a usable ashtray.  And the Rapide was grossly overpriced to begin with and sold like shit.
I thought it’s the new Honda Accord
"Most expensive luxury sedan ever" ✓doesn't even have tinted windows in the rear
This is not Aston Martin seven figure luxury... this is middle eastern capriciousness, or better yet mediocre middle eastern capriciousness.  There are countless other luxury, super-sport or hyper vehicles or even your occasional limited edition pick-up truck with far better finishes or features at a fraction of the price, relative to this price point.  This screams let's build them a $100K car, spend half building it, then sell it for seven figures to people that keep paper currency next to their commode.  Ridiculous.
Nice how it has a touch of the 70s lagonda anteater look
It's an Aston Martin so next month you can this sedan for $32 and a pack of newports.
As a Middle Eastern  "turreoff" annoyed the heck out of me I thought it was Italian....... "Taaruf" is how the word is pronounced in Arabic
a million dollar car that has 2 ipads and plastic stocks from a ford focus. proof that being rich doesn't buy you iq points
This!!!
Normalise km/h.
Front end looks like an old Cadillac STS.
Is it just me or does it look weird. Back end looks like a blue whales mouth and the side profile is just off
Doug this isn’t beautiful, it’s a Honda Accord front and a jaguar rear. This ain’t it
I’m a massive Aston fan but this thing is an embarrassment
You are definitely loving on this car. It’s a Ford fusion front with a Dodge charger back.
If I don't read the title carefully, I thought that car was something made from South Korea
i would not buy this even if i had a billion dollars. looks shit
Beautiful is where I would have to agree to disagree.
In my opinion It’s ugly and overpriced
I always have to increase the playback speed to 1.75 given how slow he speaks
still waiting for the Lamborghini Gallardo review🙂
There is no reason for this to be a million. 400k ish. But that keep is epic
For a million bucks I’d expect the center control stack to look better than the one on my dad’s 2010 Mazda3... I mean like I said, I would **expect** that to be the case...
Love the way to say PHHLANETHH
A million dollars for a parts bin car?  What a joke.  And that hydraulic strut on the rear door is pathetic.  That is just lazy engineering.  Maybe they should have spoken with the Lexus guys about how they might conceal it.  Aston knows their market; a bunch of people with more money than they know what to do with.
Not worth it at all. There isnt even a panoramic sunroof. Like stop
Am I the only one to think that this car is ugly? Like one of the ugliest car I have EVER seen...
I was left rather speechless after an ad for the Nissan Leaf, of all things, played just after the 10 min. mark!!
Not a fan
It is not worth even 50k $!!!! 1m $ is far..........
Doug could sell a toothpick to a gopher
🤮🤢💩
Aston Martin is so garbage lol.
I'll take 2 phantoms, thanks!
Nah I'll take 2 phantoms
Does exclusivity count if no one has even heard of it 😂
Guys, just buy a RR phantom and save around 400k Thank me later😂
Oh c'mon Doug it's not SO beautiful. Paint job looks great, front end looks good and modern, but it's not something very best. Rear of the car looks just standard, how did you managed to recognize a "concept car look" in it? What's CONCEPT about this rear end? Tail lights, chromed strip, what exactly?
This is the most expensive Ford Mondeo i ever fucking seen.
Million dollar..... stitching....... million dollar....... stitching.......this is just an over priced leather handbag on wheels
If anyone watching knows someone who can get a 1972 Mustang Olympic Sprint edition to start and drive? Please let me know. Because I just inherited one
One ugly car, not quite as bad as the original, but not far behind. Uber rich have no taste or class.
I think it's good that Aston shares parts with ford.  It makes it easier to obtain parts as they age.
Who would buy this over a RR phantom
Loving the teasers in the cars&bids shoutout
I can see why the main market for this car is Saudi- Arabia, because this is really only for people who literally don‘t know what to do with all their money and at this point just start one- upping each other on the prices they pay for luxury items. This is a very nice car of course but I really don‘t see why it is twice the money of a Rolls Royce.
the front interior....  A VW looks better lol
price equivalent to two phantoms and is actually not even equivalent to half phantom standards
Beautiful looking car. No doubt.  But when you can actually say that a Rolls royce......any of them, are a much better,cheaper,option, that's all you need to know.
Give it 5 years, it will be worth $80k😂
Never I would buy THIS for a million. Even no power closing trunk, how?
SERIOUSLY???? DID HE REALLY REVIEWED A LAMBORGHINI CENTANARIO!!!
Doug, you are absolutely correct on just how exquisitely beautiful this sedan is.  I'd still take my million dollars to buy a RR with plenty of money left leftover for life's other luxuries.
...meh.
Is it me or do the back lines look like a Dodge charger
Public: A MASERATI SHARES SOME PARTS WITH A DODGE CHARGER!! UNACCEPTABLE    1 mill dollars Aston Martin: Hold my turn signal stalk...
Man you're the real daddy of car reviewing
And the world's ugliest too...
Def doesn’t look like  a million dollar car. Or a half a million honestly
I'm not so sure about the styling. Ford has successfully copied the Aston Martin radiator grille to death so the front of this "million dollar   luxury car" looks pretty, hmmm, "Fordy" to me. Like the other "Gondola" from the eighties and competing abominations of that era like the RR Camargue, the manufacturers just built a car to aim at the highest price because there were people around to buy them just to show the world they could. I wouldn't want to drive a car that is the only one in my continent - think of the fun you'll get when a windscreen breaks or you'll have an otherwise harmless fender bender ..
This is one of the strangest videos.. Left me feeling like I'm not actually seeing what the car is or how it looks.. I mean it's not ugly but sure as hell it's not even close to being the most beautiful car..
That is not even close to the majestic luxury of a phantom.  Whats with the weird c pillar??🤔
The back end looks like a Dodge a bit.
17:46 oh god the screen said dab
There is one in Mexico: https://youtu.be/iml06xH1AQY
Sorry... but the front of this car looks very similar to the 2021 Hyundai Elantra.....
I hope people realize that this car is 5 years old. It still holds up nice in spite of its age. It's sad to see some have been brainwashed to believe that Bentley, Rolls-Royce, Bugatti, ECT... are the standard for luxury.
Taraaaaf.
if i had 1M $, i would find one million better ways to spend them
adapted to rip off rich oil sheikhs
I was just about to order it and then the Ford blinker and Garmin Navi killed me.
The resale must be horrible.
14:28 meme material
I was in a 2012 Rapide last week that was bought for 60,000.. I would say this car is not as attractive and marginally “better”.. not 940,000 dollars better
The front is stolen from 2013 ford taurus
When they do crash tests with this really expensive cars do that use a fully completed model or only a shell? I can only imagine them crashing a 1 million dollar car for safety test..
the ashtray is bigger than the nav!
Interior is indeed damn beautiful and damn luxurious
Maybe I’d have to see it in person but I’m pretty underwhelmed
A million dollar car with a Ford focus turn signal stalk? You just put that in there for a joke, right?
Hey Doug, The correct pronunciation for the word Taraf is exactly like how you'd pronounce Ta-rough but in just one syllable.
Doesn’t even come close to a Range Rover 🤣
He just unnecessarily had to give high rating here and there to justify the high price. A normal, avg looking sedan got 10 in styling. lol
Look at all the leather in that thing! The inside of it must smell like a baseball glove.
For 1 million,  it better come with shares from Aston Martin
I taught it was a 2008 🤣
Why is Doug reviewing a Dodge Charger?
I would rather buy a Bently flyingspur for less if I had that kind of money !
This car looks good he saw this in London .
His next video will be the centenario
Ive never seen this car before
Built for people who didn't really earn their money
The interior is shit
when ur ford focus' turn signal stock can be found in a million dollar car
best looking 4 door ever?! i know cali is trashy but what crack have you been smoking?
Wow does the grill look like genesis
wait so the trunk doesnt close automatically?
Can't wait to get this for 32k in 5 years
I'd say the value is a 1
Imagine paying 1 M for a front end from a Honda
For as much as this car costs, i could live how i am for the next 50 years without a job. I could literally live as i currently do until i die....And there's less differences between this and the Rapide than going from an S class to a Maybach
First time in the history of time You show me a car which i have never seen before.
This is 900k$ more than it's worth
Red LEDs turn to orange! What a great feature for $1M!
I wonder how much profit Aston Martin made on each of these
Why that lambo look like a bugatti chiron
Is that V12 still 2 Ford Taurus V6s joined together?
I guess that specific Laginda was designed for the people in Europe, middle easterns wont be so happy having only heated seats in the rear...
Not nearly as luxurious as a Rolls Royce. Doug gets way too emotional when reviewing expensive cars, he makes regular features, like the blinkers, soft-close trunk and “stop anywhere” doors (which, at a point, clearly didn’t stay where he left it so he grabbed it not to show the poor design) seem like groundbreaking innovations. Most of those are present in $100k cars, even cheaper.  About the design, it’s obviously personal taste, but to me, it looks nice, but nothing exceptional. There are lots of better looking cars around. Again, seems like Doug is bamboozled by the price tag and the low production numbers.  Also, there is *a ton* of plastic on this one. Keep in mind that, for a million dollars, any plastic is a lot of plastic. That steering wheel looks especially out of place.  A ridiculously trashy car for the price. Not even close to being worth the $1M price tag AT ALL.
13:25 *belt buckle forseskin*  _b e l t  b u c k l e  f o r e s k i n_
Why wouldn’t you get a fully optioned rolls Royce?
I love the paint on this car!
FUGLAAAAAAY
Rolls Royce where you at?
The sales tax for thissss car is an S classs Mercedessss!!
Phantom is way more luxuriously beautiful imo
Can’t wait for the centinario review
Ah yes, the original owner went for the "inside out basketball" aesthetic with these colors.
0:25 They only made 120 for the entire Dubai...let's be honest
Thank you for this Doug!
A million bucks for 10 dead cows... and tech the equivalent of a 2010 Elantra... such a shame.. RIP cattle.. 🐄 x 10
I'd rather buy a rolls and a fucking house please thank you
The face in that black looks like a interceptor police car
I'm guessing the windows auto-lower further than other cars to let more hot desert air out of the car before you get in?
Has anyone noticed that all his thumbnails he has his hands out? 🤷
Rolls-Royce phantom is a value for money when campared to this car
I’d still prefer to  buy a rolls Royce
It's not beautiful.  Not even close. If this represents a million dollars,  then we need a new form of currency!!👨‍⚖️
Who the hell would pick this one over a bentley/rolls royce? Generenic looking (ugly IMO) and CLIPS for an IPAD? Seriously? and 1 MILLION for this? Fking joke.
Doug: "Truly the most beautiful sedan ever made." Chat: "Long Ford."
Doug's the type to not trust stairs because their always up to something.
I feel bad for his knees
Koenigsegg Gemera like 👀
I don't like the AC vents..    but Engine looking ❤️❤️❤️
Looks like a Ford!
What’s that clunking noise when he turned the corner at 24.17 and 25.00 ???
100k 120k price tag? Sure, great car. Million-dollar car? Terrible, garbage
Nothing special in this car for 1 million is just overrated
its nowhere near a 10/10 in styling imo
Tbh this is more of a 100k car than a 1 million car
Doug it's not beautiful. And also doors don't stay put just anywhere, it started to close when you were reviewing it and it shows! This one sounded like you are selling the car.
Headlights looks like an accord still a very beautiful sedan
So it is made from parts (basically copy paste) from a cheaper Aston Martin, parts from a Ford, this has to be the most over priced luxury sedan in the world and technologically speaking the Rolls Royce is light years ahead. Basically this car makes no sense, not even at half the retail price.
Who looks at this and say yeah that's better than a Rolls Royce
Far too many mass produced, common parts on that car to be a million dollars I don't care what era it's from. You're talking about a price point very close to a Bugatti Chiron, which shares VERY little with anything else in the world. I was very much expecting to see a very unique looking steering wheel made out of hand carved wood and switch gear out of billet aluminum or solid brass. And the Garmin GPS? Really????? Even for 2015 or whenever this car was built, that was awful. Honda had better, bigger factory GPS units in the Accord at that time!
WHERE IS CNC MOTORS??! DOUG, WHAT IS HAPPENING??
That trunk?! Wow. This is really really bad.  Might be the worst thing I’ve seen on here considering the price.
I think this  car looks kind of boring ....
Nice honda accord
The number plate will steal the look of its beautiful grill.
A luxury brand with a luxury brand. Wut.
I prefer the 80s one.
no one is going to pay for a one million dollar sedan with for turning signals 😂😂
It looks like a Dodge Charger
A 60k asian luxury sedan is more bespoke than this. The aston martin name just isn't worth as much and this car is proof. This is for the "niche market" that buy things just to say how much they cost and how rare they are. If the name means ultimate luxury I wonder how well ultimate scam goes with the lagonda brand in arabic.
1 million pounds for this piece of shit  ! just goes to show stupid rich people will buy anything  new and shiny.........  smfh
This thing sucks
I would rather buy a couple of s classes
Also the ugliest
...if rolls Royce and Aston Martin had a minaj with a Chelsea boot this would be the outcome
Cant wait in 10 years when its worth $100k
Most overpriced car ever ☝️
Next video's gonna be sick though...
Why on earth do I see plastic in that car. For $1,000,000 there shouldn't be any plastic whatsoever, anywhere in the cabin
Meh, it's just a very well-specced ultra-long wheelbase Rapide!!
We want you to film our 1 of 3 Yes! 3.2 roadster and our 1 of 2 yes CUP R. Super rare and super fast
Car : cost 1 million dollars       Me : is that an iPad🤔🤔 Well done aston martin👏👏
I don’t think it looks beautiful.
I still think the jaguar XJ is the most beautiful sedan and limousine in the world
Wow this sedan is cool the Aston Martin looks great !! This is a large car by the British ! Doug is cool ! This car has a lot features and quirks .
Doug, what the HECK is that noice at 24:16?  Perhaps you broke the gorgeously beautiful automobile.
we are gonna get a centenario review in some days
Wao Amazing Job Brother. #nadeemvlogs
Anyone else find this kinda ugly?
Why do you call sedan as sedain.?
Ford figo aspire has the same door stop feature without the fancy hydraulic
1 million dollars and still no sunroof?
It has the turnsignal stock from other Fords, and the capless fuel system
A V12 loafer
That thing is definitely not better looking than an E38.... especially with the weird roofline
For one million dollars you can get this absurdity or you could buy a decent house on a couple hundred acres in Texas, a 4Runner and a dog and still have money left over...
9:15 when being so excited about a car that you forget about pain (those knees)
Wow this is a scam.
Taraf TV
doug calling it beautifull got me shocked, Thats one  ugly car
It looks... Plain
awfull !
You can drive it around if you have a million dollars...or you're me
It's looks Soo ugly for a 1 million bucks🤮
How lovely 😊. I get to watch some Doug Demuro on my birthday 🍰.
I think the circles are called brogueing I may be incorrect
That Lamborghini at 0:44 looks straight out of Forza Horizon
3 min 30 seconds in and the review hasn’t started yet....
I think you are kind of blinded by the price and rarity of this car. Its not that beautiful and cool.
That grill looks like the cool aid man is smiling at you "oh yeah"
I mean, they could have done this car cheaper, a million is waaaaay to much
I was today years old when I heard of this car.
Those screens in the back look outdated already
This car is a joke. Not surprised that they decided to sell it Middle East
It should be a crime to choose this over a phantom 😷
Beautiful?! This car doesn't suit my eyes at all.
One million for a car that looks like a honda accord
Why does it look like an extended dodge challenger to me
1M$?  Thats laughable.
*How do they get away with this. No rear screens, cheap looking steering wheel and indicators and half the interior from a car that cost around a 5th of the price. I’d more expect it to be the step up from the Rapide, maybe £200k. Ridiculous.*
As a vintage car lover I have to say that as ugly as the 1980s model was, the 2018 Lagonda is spectacular
Doug, I think it would cool if you could cover the Chrysler 300 s and c. Like so he can see this!
Taraf TV
The car doesn't reflect 1m
This car doesnt look really good lolk
14:39 I have that 12V socket cap in my Ford. I will never look at it the same way again.  It is good enough for a million dollar sedan. Wow.
25:56 was that a Rapide in the back?
The front grill looks like and nsx
looks like a gta online car
Chrysler has a potential to bring the 200 or 300 back with this design language
We have 3 in México
Doug the type of guy to buy a Lamborghini to match his Tshirt
So why would you buy this over a phantom?
tip: you say: Km/h, not kph
A million dollar car,yet it has the same door lock as a 50 year old Volvo. Typical Aston. I bet the ECU is from the last century too.
Seeing Doug next to that Centenario gets me excited asf😂
I’d rather buy an s63 amg and save 800,000$ I don’t know what idiot would buy this thing
This was 30 mins of Doug trying to justify the price tag lmao
Tbh, the rare climate control and the vents are a big disappointment. In such an expensive car, one deserves way better. Overall the car itself is a huge disappointment. It just looks good. Everything else is horrible.
I’ll just get a $7000 LS430 and have more luxuries
That car should be $200,000 max!!
This is the crappiest Doug DeMuro video I have ever watched, How can u call it beautiful if the front end design looks like a genesis?
Kinda looks like a Jaguar xf from the back
Excuse me but Styling is 10/10? Not even close. The long hood, extreme windshield rake, the relatively abrupt angle of the C pillar... Not saying it's hideous but it's far away from being the most beautiful sedan.
Looks like those chineses copy cars with fake name
Sorry but it looks like a Chrysler concept car   1 million bucks??  I’m not seeing it.  Give me a Phantom any day of the week
"taraf" means "luxury" in Arabic, BTW.
This video is making me want to eat the rich
I feel the hydraulic arm sticking out that way (10:15) under the door is poor attention to detail.
WTF, there is a new Lagonda? Holy crap, I loved that old Lagonda. I wouldn't call it "breathtakingly beautiful" and "the most beautiful sedan ever made", just think of the Rapide that actually looks like a coupé. This one has some weird edges and lines...it certainly looks interesting and like a concept car, though.  btw, what beautiful pattern should that be on the headliner? some straight lines? really? :D
The front is almost an exact copy of the Mk5 Ford Mondeo
1M Hell F#%¥ no!!!
Million bucks and no sunroof.... I was into it until then....
Why’s he so obsessed with the styling? Yeah it’s nice looking but 10/10? The most beautiful sedan ever? I think there’s several cars from the 1930s-60s that easily beat this.
Dougs knees at 8:42: THISSSSS hurts !
A base model RR is way more worth the price than this overpriced sedan. Buying this is almost like throwing $600,000 into the sea and $400,000 actually for the car.
expensive sister of Rapid S!!!
I can buy Mercedes mayback in $1 million rather than this car
The rich keep getting richer 🙄
Meh
Ford stole the style of Astin for their everyday sedans....ruined the look for me
Price aside, this car looks nice. Not incredibly beautiful, but nice enough for a sedan in an era of overkill, ugly car exterior designs. This particular color, though, ruins it all. Gold is the color for this car, period.
For that price, it better fly.
Uhhhh, GARMIN is an awesome system tbh, short of just going full Google carplay.    That turn signal is terrible though make no mistake. And the steering wheel... and the basicness of the interiour. Bentley really has Aston buried here.
Did Doug include the exhaust note?
Lets put some leather on standard Aston Martin Vintage, we can sell it for 1 million dollars to stupid people in the middle east. Good job Aston Martin.
$1m is way too overpriced for this car. I can see it realistically going for maybe $200k.
BEAUTIFUL CAR BUT IM NOT PAYING 1M FOR IT 🤷🏾‍♂️
Still waiting for the Viper review...
1 milion $ car and has the navigation of a fucking dacia duster
Middle East must be full of rich fools 🤣
After motortrend's horrible review of this car, where they didn't even show the back seat, it's nice to finally get a full review of this thing.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 janjakhrojan1989@gmail.com
22:43 yo imma fill up my lagonda bro no cap
It looks ok in my opinion. Has some nice aspects to it. Not a 1m car for me though.
Its an ugly car, but I will say this, no one does interior leather work like Aston, that is gorgeous.
Rip off for ultra rich Arabs.Bye the way I loved the old Lagonda. Another car's switches, Fridge openly sticking out in a small trunk. What the hell did you charge customer's for?   Roll Royce: Rich man riding  Taraf: Rich fool riding
It really is OVERPRICED 😂
So u telling me I’m paying 1 million dollars and no soft closing doors 💀
The Bentley Flying Spur beats this Car in many many many ways....
Judging beauty is a matter of taste. I personally think that this car is very ugly,  compared to other sedans.
RAM limited grill 😂
Somebody: Hey, Taraf owner, your indicator stalks are from a Ford Focus! Taraf Owner: What is this Ford Focus that you speak of? Never heard of it.
Man that front looks like a Honda s660
That leather ceiling is already sagging
Jokes on you, we have one in Mexico City. Check out Don Huayra's garage.
It's kinda obvious that this car isn't really worth a mil and I think AM knows that. They made this just for rich schmucks in the Middle East, which there are a lot of, that want to feel more special and more important than they actually are. Don't tell me that they made a 100th anniversary AM just to happen to name it an Arabic word.
Let me put my pretentious hat on for a sec. But for a million dollars I would expect those iPad holders to have a charger built into them. Dangling wires? Eww.
You can tell he has major AM bias from being a previous owner.  This is no where near being the most beautiful 4DS. The tech is pathetic and soft close doors and trunks were around decades ago lol.
this kind of design can sold 1 million dolars, that is so easy to earn money
One million dollars and the iPads don't charge themselves in factory iPad holders.
Why do the headlights look like a 2020 accords? Honda ripped off the best ig.
It would be cool if there was a UK Cars & Bids
I Still Dont Understand How  and Why this is Worth a Million.
I don't think this car looks beautiful AT ALL.
That car is extremely Ugly
Well, at least it will depreciate to V8 Vantage levels in record time
Doesn’t worth it.  It is like you are trying to sell it.
doug sold his soul. sounds like he's trying to sell the car more than review it.
According to Wikipedia "The Taraf started production in 2015 and ended production on Dec 2016", So how could it be A 2018 model??
externally looks like a 40~50k car lol what a really bad joke
This car has 0 sex appeal, looking at it, no one will never say it costs that much... Maybe 200k maximum
i bid one dollar
"Stays exactly where you put it" *The door moves itself Doug: Quickly grabs the door to make it not noticeable
Looks about 100k max
THIISSSS is a very overpriced car
Its not really worth a million dollars
Lagonda Trash.  Can't be a million dollars car every thing you'll get is old man thing which is outdated.
I think that the Phantom is better than this
"Taraf in arabic stands for ultimate luxury"  Me, an arab : did you make that up?  Also i'd take an AMG S-Class any day over this.
Ugly AF. Aston Martin can fo better.
Probably the most over priced Car I’ve ever seen. Its about as disappointing as Maserati using fiat Chrysler parts lmao
Front looks like a Hyundai Elantra tbh.
Looks like a car from gta5
No Panorama Sunroof?
This car is just ugly. How can Doug say this is the best looking 4door sedan in the market.
Beautiful exterior, underwhelming interior. Kinda like the ppl I end up dating. 🥴   Bentley GT for me, please.
100k car max...lol
Looks like a glorified current gen Honda Accord from the front lol
At least, for one milion Bucks you can have an Aston with actual rear seats...
This car has nothing that a Lexus LS doesn't already have and the Lexus is better looking.  Oh, and the Lexus doesn't have an ugly key hole on the door.
It looks like a 1500$ shitbox with those rims and paint...
It looks ugly as fuck. Doug has lost his litte American mind.
It looks like the newest model Honda Accord from the front 🤷‍♂️
Looks like a Renault Laguna
What's with the ugly dodge Challenger wheels !!
It's perfect for the idiots in the middle east.  Aston surely took them for a ride.
The outside is so attractive that you don't even know that this is literally a million dollar Rapide. Stupid money spent if anyone bought it
Still Looks like a ant eater
Looks like the abomination child of an Audi and a Ford Mondeo  Doug : the most beautiful 4door car.  Jesus fucking Christ this dude is weird
Two years ago is an “ era!”
For a million dollars I expect much better than a nav screen from 2006 and the parts out of a fiesta. Aston always like to cheap on the details. Truthfully this absolutely NOT worth anywhere near 7 figures. Get it together Aston. I’m surprised y’all haven’t gone out of business yet
Yo doug did you just roast me for not having a million dollars😭
what are your knees made out of doug? i know that concrete is uncomfortable lol
Ugglyyyyyy🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I think the Alfa Romeo Giulia looks better.
this is basically  a real life version of those 5 million dollars GTA cars with unreal looks but the same interior as the compact car that's available literally anywhere at any time in the map
I'll take a depreciated Aston Martin Rapide over this, which is basically almost the same car for 1/20 of the price
strange proportions on this thing lol, super long in the front stubby in the back
S650 Maybach would eat that car for breakfast
I have a Lagonda...                                                  .... ashtray
That thing should go for a max of 250k, I would prefer an 20years old s class over the taraf
I’m gonna buy a $50K Rapide and budget $950K to restyle it😂
So that means that you are spending the most money in any carbid website
doug"1 million dollars" my brain for sum reason "wow thats like  a lot of ek civics"
I dont think value should be out of 10 points. Value should be out of 100 points. It's not fair to compare a Porsche Panamera to this when you could buy 10 panameras for the price of this one.
Nobody:  Doug: *Casually teases Centenario*
Middle East you mean very rich Muslims
Does It Look Like A Fancy/Luxury Dodge Charger/Challenger From The Side And A Genesis From The Front To You Guys Or Just Me
centanario review??
Looks like a genesis mixed with a Ford Fusion
Doug: This is the most beautiful and expensive sedan ever made.  At 2040: This is the ugliest and overpriced luxury sedan ever made.
holy shit. It's just so ugly and expensive wtf
Omg that centenario is stunning, can't wait for the review
Anyone else recognized that the "cars and bids" ad section shows a sneak peek of a car he will be reviewing soon?
Doug: now you don’t have a million bucks to spend do you?   Manny Khoshbin: hold my beer
Like most car people I like Astons but for luxury it's not in the ballpark compared with the usual suspects. I'll take a Phantom or a Mulsanne thanks.
There's always something to complain about for people without enough money to buy😂😂. The price is not for the features of the car, it's for the exclusivity you get
26:44 did you see that panel gap!!!
I would prefer a maybach or bentley on this anytime....this thing looks ugly for a million dollars
Doug reviewing a BMW-made Toyota Supra: Points out everytime he sees BMW.  Doug reviewing an Aston Martin-made Lagonda Taraf: Points out everytime he sees Loganda.
Suprised about the shit comfort score... Zero reason to buy this score minus vanity
One million dollar car with fiesta turn signals, especially for the middle east... well that gives you an idea about the rich of middle east 😒
I love this car so much, I was wondering if you'd ever review one. They're so incredibly beautiful and, I can't lie, the rarity just makes me more interested. I hope I see one in person at some point in my life.
Anyone else noticed the spring clicking sound when he’s turning during the test drive?
Doug, the kinda guy who reviews absurdly expensive luxury vehicles during a global pandemic and economic crisis.
Gonna tell my kids this was a Hyundai Genesis🤣
Definitely not worth 1,000,000$.
Most expensive sedan and they couldn't find a way to hide the keyhole and used old doorhandles... XD
Is it only me or does everyone think that a Rolls Royce has a better interior than this car?
It kinda looks like a Ford Mondeo from the front
It looks pritty avarege to me. would never say the best looking sedan... but that's just me.
It looks like it’s got Walmart alloys and rattle-can paint on it.
GO LIVE DOUG!!!!
Morning hair?
This car should be $100,000 honestly, an s-class is way better
this looks like a last generation Ford taurus sho combined with a lincoln continental with some ipads thrown in the interior
Rich people around the world: Let me show my multi-million dollar car Rich people in the Middle East:  Let me show my multi-million dollar camel
The steering wheel don't look good in this car.
those lightweight wheels and red brake calipers are not a good look on a luxury sedan. Haha, just kidding, as if that’s the issue with this car! nearly a million dollars, ya kidding? eek! 😱
You’re telling me I have to open and close the door myself like that after paying a milli? 🤔
How come youtube suggested me today in the morning, the video with the original Lagonda. And now after i got home, you released a  new  video with the new car. The original video is from 2018. Mind-blowing
Not sure what people are talking about, this car looks awesome! This car looks like a vehicle Bruce Wayne aspires to acquire...  🦇🚘🦇
Aston Martin out here taking chances
Looks like an accord from the front.
1 million dollars and no soft close doors? hmmm
THIS IS A.  🤣🤣🤣🤣 love that intro
It's not worth 1M dollars, that's absurd
Rolls Royce has twice the amount of features as this and a better looking interior for half the price.
This car looks like an oversize Dodge Challenged
200,000 dollars is still too much for that car, I don’t see a million dollar anywhere on that car, I think this is just a hoax even though it’s rear it’s still too much. All I see is a 75,000 dollar sedan made rear with a ridiculous price.
When a luxury brand Aston Martin has its own luxury brand...
The front end reminds me of the Honda City from 2013
I can already see Hoovie buying the cheapest one in 10 years or so.
Was there any mention at all about why it's in the USA?? I might have missed it but I heard none of that after he said he's talk about it.
Should we tell Doug that that car is actually hideous? He seems so enamored with it. I'd hate to be the one to burst his bubble...
Stupid car
So not worth $1M.
It's definitely not worth a million dollars
Exposed key hole, no screens in back, ford turn signal, garmin navigation, it's a beautiful car for sure but (if i had 1mil)i wouldnt get this,
I can't be the only one that thinks this is an interesting, but not beautiful looking sedan, right?
Lagonda 2: Return of the Anteater
Love how the Aston Martin logo I’m the bad looks like a Genesis logo.
The way he said "give it a Dougscore" hit a little different this video
It’s just down right ugly.
The front looks like a Ford Mondeo! Apart from that it is a nice looking car but not as fantastic as Doug makes it out to be, at least not for me. Even if I had a million bucks to spend on a car I wouldn't buy this, at half the price the Rolls Royce Phantom is more luxurious and commands more presence on the road and just looks majestic!
Wanna die? Take a drink each time he says Lagonda.
Million dollar car with a radio screen straight out of the Walmart radio aisle
I will take a rolls Royce or even Bentley over this any day...
Looks like fictional GTA 5 car
Lamborghini Centenario Review coming👀
I cannot believe a million dollar Ford Focus has a Garmin infotainment system.
Ugly...and would NOT paid anything over $5000 for it.
Honestly don't think it's that good looking. could be a kia or a dodge
This is just an overpriced rapide😠👎👎🤮
10:05 It will stay exactly there [door moves]
In Romanian, "taraf" designates a gypsy band!😂😂😂
This car is actively complaining that a plebeian in touching it
Hey the 10 gen Accord called and said they want their fucking headlamps back‼️🤣
Doug doing art critique now. Proportions and lines this perfect are rare.
Somehow I feel weird about the matte colour
Hmmm instead maybe a GT3, 360 Challenge Stadale, Ford Raptor, and a daily Tesla Model S. Then invest the rest lol.
Doug: This is the most beautiful car ever made.  Meanwhile at a car contest: BMW E38: Ohhh it's ON b*tch!
I would pay 80k for this car and that’s it.
pathetic car
It’s hard to fathom a million bucks on this when my S550 has every feature and then some that this car has. Wild.
That game about our is not an Aston Martin, it is Lagonda ends in the moment, when you sit inside the interior 😀
The Lagonda Isn't supposed to be a bargain. What's another 500k to a Middle Eastern oil tycoon?
The year is 2042 and Hoovie will take this to the car wizard
The Rapide looks way better to me. This one is odd
It’s not the most beautiful sedan
Aston Martin is such a dogshit car company. The only cool things they made are their old GT cars and their more recent supercars like the Vulcan and Valkyrie
Anyone else think that rear end looks like a much nicer Dodge Challenger?
Profile looks like a Hellcat with slicked back hair.
Looks like 50000 Doller Volkswagen
850k more expensive than a Rapide for the same thing with minor diferences . Just stupid car for idiots. Not bespoke at all. Not special enough.
The roof line is trash. NOT a good looking car, Doug is on crack.
I saw one in London, near the US embassy, had no clue what it was until I read "Lagonda". It is beautiful.
front face kinda look like a honda accord.
The pop up sat nav, the digital radio/aircon display and the messege/gear select display between the dials are from a Ford-owned era mid 2000s Volvo!  I also recall that AM used Volvo electric window and wing mirror controls on their cars too, but I don't think you showed them to verify.... At that price, it's enough to make you sheikh... sorry, shriek... no.... wait.... ;)
It’s probably me but the Comments sections looks weird; yet another update
One Million for this LOL.  I've seen Cheaper cars that were more luxurious than this.
one million but they have to use ipads for the backseat? just buy a RR cmon now
This video made me finnaly belive that my ears need a general refurbishment - even after several times rewinding to the start, I still hear Doug saying "This is a 2018...".
This car is specifically made for  fools cuz  Aston Martin knows they can easily find one in middle East..
One Million Dollar Sedan... What's the depreciation rate per year of this thing...?
This video is very biased. I think a s class is more beautiful.
Calling this car the most beautiful sedan ever made is like when people thought Megan fox was the hottest girl in the world
If I had a dollar for every time he said “a million dollars” I would actually have a million dollars
Tell me something i don't know.. Doug: it's not Aston Martin it's lagonda  😁😂
That spec though 🥴... Configuration by Stevie Wonder
Ostensibly priced
You should give more 10's.
The stupidest way to open a door I have ever seen .
You might as well just say, "They only made 120 of these for the entire universe." It is highly unlikely that an extraterrestrial power has made one. Alternate universes,  however...
Honestly? Beautiful? I tend to agree with Doug, but this car is just ugly.
Rare and expensive does not mean superiority. This thing should be priced around 100-200k.
*Indicators on light   Doug “Distinctiveness”
very nice the mondeo
For a million id want a Racing Point Formula 1 car, not a rebadged Rapide.
hopefully nobody bought this ford taurus
So that’s what a million dollars worth.
Beautiful??? In the 25k price range maybe.....
This is an underwhelming car for $1mn. Exclusivity doesn't matter when you've got instrumentation which will embarrass itself before a $40k car. Pathetic attempt from Aston Martin.
Nice car, but sure in hell isn't a million dollar car.... Ford focus indicator? seriously? An Audi S8L is far more luxuries then this car, and the fraction of the price.
It kinda looks like a Peugeot from side or rear.
"Thissss" is definitely NOT my next car.
For being a million dollar car it should have cooling rear seats
Am i the only one who thinks the car is ugly
You point out that there's glass between the windows of this car, but not on like every Tesla ever?
honda accord
So just a roomier Rapide for 20x the price.
I think this car is specifically brought for Jeff Bezos thinking in mind.
Our beautiful Arab princes definitely weren't ripped off buying this s class wannabe and they definitely definitely didn't use poor people's money buying them and we as Arab citizens definitely won't criticize them for doing such thing even if we did we definitely won't go missing in jails for doing so...
A new definition of "overpriced"
Sorry but this car is not worth 1 million dollars. Rather have a rolls Royce !!!
The millon dollar car that is not even worth 100k dollar
A MILLION Dollars what ! A Rollsroyce phantom is way nicer and cheaper than this.
How did exterior impressed doug? 🤔🧐
Doug is my favorite blind car reviewer..
Very expensive ford fusion lol
it doesn't even have power-tailgate ? :D
"You don't exactly have a million bucks to spend, now do you?"  damn doug you don't have to call me out like that
The best Hyun.. excuse me, the best Genesi.. wait.. no, no. The weirdest Aston ever.
I saw this car for sale 6 months ago on dupontregistry.com and was very surprised to see it. I'm not a fan of the matte black paint, but I love the beautiful interior. If I had the money I wouldn't buy one as a Bentley Flying Spur or Mulsanne would be much better valve. Thanks.
Front end gives me honda vibes
It looks like Honda or some other Japanese car from late 80s early 90s.
For a million dollars , Id buy a Wraith and keep some change
Looks like a zero should be taken of the price of that car.
Well now we know what we have in store for next review 🙂
What makes this car cost? NOTHING! PS: even no little glass panel on the roof....
Sorry...no. This is a cynical money grab by Aston (the original target market speaks volumes)...nothing in there justified a price point of even quarter of a Rolls...let alone 2x. And the reused switchgear and infotainment is something Doug has crushed other brands for and he just skims over it here because he is so taken by the styling? Other than artificial velvet rope style rarity...I'd say 120 people got their faces ripped off.  Of course there is always a greater fool, so another "collector" may pay more in a few years?
One mill for a slightly updated Rapide? naaa I’m good
22:53 That engine/engine bay is so clean, it looks fake or I could eat off of it.  Whoever cleaned that after shipping/driving/etc. needs a major raise.
The Cars & Bids plugs are the best ways to know what videos are coming soon 😂
just be the CEO of amazon apple or google and this car could be yours!
Taraf means tip or end point in Arabic طَرَف
this car is a Trash  it Worth no more than 1 Dollar
Is it just me? The headlights on this are giving me 2016 and above honda civic/2015-2016 Dodge avenger/Dart vibes? That's all in was thinking the whole time I seen them! A mix between the both
OK I'm a little weird, but I wonder if Aston Martin paid Kendig It the royalty for the door handles?
This is basically just a rebadged aston martin rapide just modernised. 👎
Nice Genesis!
That is not a $1,000,000 interior and the front end looks like Honda's design language.
It's a shame it is in matte black, really hides the body lines
the rear, from the C pillar, gives it a look like a modern version of a 80s crime family boss car
Ah yes making $1m sedan because Arabs wanted it  Also the grille looks like a taller ford fusion grille
Owerpriced..also Rolls i way more cooler. Also my mercedes AMG S63 have same comfort than this and cost 4X less price:) And is some reason that brown leather make me sick:(
bruh a 10/10 for style?! that centenario roadster should get a 10/10 for style
How much did they pay Doug for praising the car smh
This exterior design is so unbalanced.
The leather roof looks so wrong
the front end looks like the new accord 😂
so it's basically an expensive trash.
I would expect something more of most expensive sedan. Mercedes looks better than this creature.
No rear seat tablet to control the car functions...nah bruh????
This car is f*cking shit for a million dollars. Like wtaffffffff
Doug I've been watching you for years.. there have been very few to almost none of your video's I do not like .. This is the 1st video where I feel like your showing me feces wrapped in leather .. you have a soft spot for Aston Martin and you don't call them out on their sh*t like you do for other Brands ...
People in Saudi Arabia buying this like it’s nothing while I’m looking for a nice Lexus GS under $5k 😭
Wow 1700 Coments within an hour of posting! great Job Doug!
Didn't come to the North American market because N.A. recognizes a very overpriced car.
(Doug) What makes this car worth a million dollars? (Anyone with common sense) Because some wealthy idiot in the Middle East was willing to pay it. This car is worth about $ 30,000. It’s such a loser! Ford turn signal lever? Really! OMG and someone paid a million bucks! LOL!!!  And look at the fuel door, you must press a button in the interior and the door opens! Amazing!
The new 2022 VW jetta
In my opinion the interior color isn’t that much
There’s an umbrella...in a car that was only meant to be sold in the Middle East
Is it just me or did anyone else notice the soft opening rear arm rest!
This car makes the Rolls Royce phantom a bargain!
Because regular Aston Martins are for the working class, we need a luxury brand!
What a total scam and waste of money, of a car. A Mercedes-Benz A-class has a nicer interior. But, I guess when you're a billionaire, middle-eastern, Playboy, you don't really care that it costs $1Million and has a Ford turn signal.
0:38 car name?
I agree it's a pretty stunning looker. I tend to think that whining about cars that use generic interior bits in more expensive models is a total first world problem. But hell, if you're spending 1 mill, even I think that stalks from a Focus is insane. I thought the Dougster should've mentioned the paint job - unusual, striking and classy
Looks like a Renault from the side
Sure it looks nice but “most beautiful”?  No. It looks like an elongated 2018 Hyundai Ioniq
Doug is the type of guy who review a million dollar car and market his website with a 5 million dollar car
Still cant see why it worth twice the RR...
looks like acura NSX from front
The more i look ar this car, the more i hate it
It doesn't looks like a 1 million dollar car btw 🤷
The Taarrraaaaffff, how many time you have to remind us that its is a one million dollars Tarraaafff
With the wheels of a Toyota Corolla.
I was a huge fan of Doug earlier, but from this video I think he gets paid to say nicer things about cars. Look at that key hole in the front door!!!! He usually makes fun of Ferrari for it but did not mention about it in this video at all...!!!! The interior looks awful. I can't understand what makes this up to a 1 million dollar mark. An E63 would be far better than this.
It is a very beautiful car, and the matte black looks just amazing
overpriced rapide
This was obviously built for people that simply wanted to brag they spent $1 million on a car - not for people that wanted a truely top of the line car. You can't even cross your legs in the back seat. Thanks but I'll save my million dollars....if I ever get a million dollars.
Nice Fusion!
I was lucky enough to catch just the slightest of glimpses of one in Cannes in the south of France and I couldn't believe my eyes considering this is such a rare thing.
Thisssssss isssssss luganduh 😂😂😂
I thought Doug was going to say: «Nothing says "100 years of Aston Martin" like a car for $1000000»
This guy literally can’t pronounce vowels
The technology on this $1.000.000 car is 20 years behind
The C pillar is wider than the Pacific Ocean
Doug the type of guy to homeschool his kids in the school parking lot.
If you own enough Tesla shares you can buy this car soon. Panel gaps gone.
Did he ever say how it made it to the US?
It looks like a fish.
6:32 only the people who speaks Turkish paid attention to the license plate.
I bet the sultan of Brunei had at least 7 of these
I mean, it's pretty.  But it's not worth a million dollars.
It does not look like 1 million dollar car it looks like $300000 car
review bmw e36 m3 pls
Mercedes Maybach Vision 6 is a breathtaking beatifull design. This is ok for 200k... P.S. it's  an experience when you open the backdoor in heavy rain ;)
When is the Centenario video coming?
Cool car? Jesus you say it so many times you should have named your auction site. .Cool Cars
1 million dollar car ... in black primer. ?
Wow 1m for this crap :/
Ripoff.
An s class is more luxurious than this crap .
An S class is far and much more better than this overpriced Genesis
So for a million dollars no satellite tv? Also I feel like there should be more technology. Also that navigation.... wow how old. Man no way this car is worth $1million dollars. What a piece of junk
Looks like an Alfa Romeo sedan
It's a beautiful 4 door but I'm confused why they would charge a million msrp when you can find the same interior turn signal lever and screen in a used 40k Vantage.
Aston (Nxt 5yrs) introducing the All new : Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf -S 1000hp monster ; 2million Dollar hyperSedan!!    🙈
Wow Doug, you get to review/drive million dollar cars!
The interior design looks cheap af honestly. The leather is nice but the actual design and switchgear shares too much with cheaper brands like Ford and Mazda. The new Genesis G80 has a richer looking interior than this. Also, the tech in the Aston is inexcusable for any car made after 2010.
Even if i had the money i wouldn't pay $1M for a long wheelbase rapide 😆
ugly car lol
i believe its pronounced "tah roff" roff like a dog going roff roff
No soft close on the doors?! For a million bucks... come on! hah
This would have been the most beautiful car in the world if they would have taken some inputs from Mercedes designers to make it more proportionate
Can't wait for the next video. Centenario!! 💯🔥
How does this add up to $1,000,000?😂  It’ll depreciate quick enough to be more reasonable, but still lmao
Beautiful? Yes.  A rip-off? Yes
Rear reminds me of the Continental
I would still rather be seen in a RR . And still have money for a lambo for the weekend.
LC500 in both coupe and cabrio version looks way, way better than this piece of brochure exercise and it costs 10 times less.  The gauge cluster looks like a combination of a Tacoma/Tundra and some Lexus gauges. How much imagination an average buyer of this thing has to loose before signing the papers?   This is not "We made 120 of these because we wanted them to be exclusive.", it is actually "We've made 120 of these because it is such a longshot at unimaginative wealthy people of this world".   When will this trend end? Put some diamonds and gold in it for God's sake. Maybe then there will be some meat to back up this ridiculous 1 million price tag. Otherwise, it is a parts bin special, somewhat similar to the chef's salad.
This has got to be the worst million dollar car ever.
It ia actualy ugly
Doesn't even have a sun roof...
That glass B-pillar trim is a pretty cool idea.  So many cars are doing the piano black trim thing, which scratches if you look at it wrong and generally looks terrible unless you slap PPF on top of it after correcting out the scratches and swirls.  Glass won't do that.
Who would have this over a Rolls Royce if given the choice for the purposes they offer? That is a 200k car sold at a huge profit for gullible oil barrens in the dessert!
"Yes, I'd like to change my sparkplugs." *dealership laughs in luxury"
Love listening to Doug talk about a car that came out in 2018 like it came out in 1982
Interesting fact, the Royal Family of Saudi Arabia has one in this deep shade of blue and it's absolutely fucking gorgeous.
How many 🐖 were sacrificed for all that leather?
Rapide LWB ..... just not worth it.
Expensive sausage car
That Centario looks soooo good!!
$1M and no sunroof? nice
Doug is the type of guy who compares the Ford Tourus to a million dollar Aston Martin.
Bentley flying spur is the best luxury sedan in my opinion
canada has km/h doug
"You can see it has a front fender fill, as a lot of cars from this era did."  Doug, this car is 3 years old. It is this era.
You´r 4dour Kia Stinger has better Styling than this overpriced piece.
Where's your Renault Fuego or other quirky 80's car, Doug?
The last gen Quattroporte looks way better
It's a shame Aston released their "special" car that feels dated before it's shipped to you. They should've tried implementing the next gen tech borrowed from Mercedes if they couldn't come up with their own. As it is the only thing unique here is the bodywork. Not sure if it would hold it's own against a long wheelbase S-class in terms of actual comfort and luxury.
Sticker price 1million  After you drive off 750k 3 years later 200k 20 years later some where on craigslist 12k "works perfectly fine" nope
Meh I’d rather have one Phantom let alone 2
The front end on a certain angle looks like a late model XR8 Ford Falcon.....
This car is absolutely gorgeous. Not just best looking sedan ever made, probably Top 10 most beautiful cars ever made.
it's not that impressive  :/
For 1 million dollars this car looks a bit "empty"
THIS is an awesome video
I've never agreed so much with the styling score, this is really a stunning car.
Front looks like a Ford Taurus
This is the same 1 Million dollars that can buy 2 Rolls Royce Cullinans, or 8 dodge demons, or 19 Hyundai Genesis, and even 2 to 4 Houses be smart people. these companies don’t pay any where near a million dollars to make the actual car itself and let’s not even get into depreciation 🤯. #mindblown
ترف 👌
Basically is less luxurius than a rolls royce but cost double that
Yet GOOGLE has no idea this is the most expensive sedan!🤷
i dont think its gonna go up in value, probably small loss whenever you are forced to sell instead of waiting for buyer
Dont sweat on the, interior!
I think this car is *distinctive*...
we need to see that lamborghini centenario review!!
It needs a slight touch to pronounce the name correctly. Just go fast on the "ra".  Same speed on the "Ta", don't spend much time on the "ra", and then the "f"... But who gives a shit, it's expensive.
That thing is hideous
The styling looks pretty plain to me
Not bad looking car, but way way overpriced.
million dollars and a  plastic dash board , seriously !!!!! aston martin has gone nuts
Car looks cheaper than a German flagship car. No wonder it flopped.
this is motivating me to wrap my Chev Volt with matte finish vinyl..ha
120k in about 3 years flat
Not worth a million dollars at all.  They really grossly over priced it to sucker billionaire oil sheikhs into thinking this limited run meant that you need to fork out way more to be unique.   The most un unique people will buy such a car, so as to cover up their lack of presence
Ugly
a lot carried over from my 2010 V8 vantage lol and its a ZF not a single clutch ASM transmission
The grille looks like a Ford Mondeo/Fusion.
Is it a beautiful car? Yes. Does it merit a $1 million price tag? No. HELL no. This is a $400K car, at best.
The grill looks like car pog
Thats a really expensive Ford Taurus
I love the way it looks but its so overpriced, terrible
A 10 for looks? Are you kidding?
Gotta say it. This cars a heap of shit at $40,000 let alone a mil
Plastic ac vents, and a million dollar car, hmmm 🤔
Hey they copied  it from GTA online 😀
How import laws like "show and display" work would make a great More Doug Demuro video.
Doug sir... review that Lamborghini centenario plz... 😍😍😍
Doug couldn't bring himself to be critical of this car at all. 😅😅😅 Wonder why.
OOH that cars infotainment system is nasty :(
0:30 Sorry, but is he joking?
The front end looks like a Ford Fusion
The same feature of the back turn signals can be found in a European/Mexican VW Jetta MKV...
I missed your "zis is the...."
This Piece gets a 10 in Styling but a Mclaren P1 doesn't , I`m completey lost...
Am I missing something? This looks like a 150k car, not 1 million.
Aston Martin !!! Best engines and worst interiors. What a shame.
Taraf doesn't mean ultimate luxury. It mean side.
You know it’s a good day when you here “THIS”
Looks like a civic
This is to you most beautiful car?? Hahahh. Much more beautiful is Alfa Romeo 159, which cost now 6000 euros, was around 25 000 when new. This is to me ugly car, and 1 M dollars? I would not give for it 100 K if I was Elon Musk, yet alone 1 M
Looks like a stretch dodge challanger from the side
Paying 1mil for a car have the worst navigation system ,small ass trunk and no sun roof  👀WTF
Looks like a Ford Fusion that someone wrapped in a flat black and put pepboys wheels on.
Wait a few years and these will depreciate to $34,000USD.
What Five Year Old painted it flat black?🤦‍♂️
I always gotta give a good 3 min skip at the beginning 🤭
The definition of weird flex
For that price, this thing better get me laid
It’s very pretty and all but this ain’t worth $1million, is AT MOST pay $200k for it
Doug out here driving the GDP of a small island nation
What design 10/10 ? LOL So beautiful car ? Are you kidding me!? If this care pass by me i wouldn't even notice it coz it's look like 90% normal sedans.
Doesn't look worth 1 mil, looks about 300k
Is this a dewbauchee sedan
This is.........
This doesn't seems like a expensive car.
The trunk opening size reminds me of the small trunk on the 2015 Chevy Camaro
Son, I am disappoint....not a single word about the color/paint. That thing looks like having a mediocre wrap job. And yes, the headliner is nice, but the unevenness would drive me mad for that kind of money.
How many did they make for the other planets?
I’ll have 2 phantoms instead. Thanks
إنها سيارة الترف يا سادة 👌👌👌
Taraf means « higher than you could ever reach » in my native tongue.
Looks like a genesis
1million for this🤣🤣🤣
Doug: *gives a $5,000 hatchback a 2/10 for value* Also Doug: *gives a 4/10 for value to a car costing $1,000,000*
Wow, one of the most beautiful design for modern cars I’d love.
You know what they say about looks being subjective. This car, to me, isn’t better looking than the One-77.
It looks damn claustrophobic in the back seat!!!😳😳😳
Looks brilliant, but is ultimately lacking in features. It doesn’t even have cooled rear seats, massaging seats or proper rear seat entertainment. You get that stuff in a £100k S Klasse or 7er.
Front looks like a Honda Accord
It looks so bad lol. F in the chat for those who spent 1kk on that
I love this car.
It's not worth the one million 👎
Looks like a weird combination of a Maserati and Mazda 3
This car looks bland...so does Doug and his taste for cars... when it comes to best looking sedan Bentley flying spur looks 10× much better from the inside and the outside too! This car ain't even worth 100k
Genesis looks better. This looks ugly but maybe I’m too poor to appreciate rich styling
The signal lights aren’t even sequential 😒
Ford Fusion/Dodge charger mishmash.
LMAO $1 Million and no sunroof XD
Chentanario roadster review soon?
The interior is worth 1000 Lincolns and Cadillacs.......plus a Miata
1 million dollar car...seriously overpriced.  Beautiful car though.
For a million dollars that car better never break down.
In arabic Taraf is pronounced Tuh-Ruff (with the R pronounced  like spanish) and it means beyond luxury
The grill looks like Jack Nicholson's Joker mouth...
O'Gara link. No price given. Only 88 miles. Doug put a quarter of the miles on this thing.  https://www.ogaracoach.com/used/Aston+Martin/2018-Aston+Martin-Lagonda+Taraf-0501b0390a0e0ae73fbd571c5e7360a3.htm
So its just a custom rapide with a fund me margin on it
Basically Hyundai/genesis copied the Audi designs and now they took this cars look, typical of them
Looks like a modern version of that Mercedes S500 W140 which I am seeing as recommendation to this video.
The pricing is simply unacceptable. Shameless act from Aston really
A million dollars and you have to open the doors like some pleb?! Also the front end looks like a run of the mill Dodge Charger.
After Doug saying this is the best looking sedan ever, I don't know if I can go on watching him anymore
From straight-on, the grille looks like a lady doing "duck lips".I like the styling otherwise; very classic and classy.
It Looks like when you combine a Dodge Challenger with a Honda Accord.
Wow, I didn't know Honda released their lwb Accord.
23:33 that hood should be mentioned because very rare to see glass on it.
But does it have an automatic Rearview mirror like the W140 S Class?
I haven't heard anyone use the word 'distinctiv' this many time in a video. 😂
0:39 centenario with chiron colors
Matte black looks awful on this
Ford Mondeo clone
My civic has a capless fuel door
The headlights shape remind me of the new Honda Accord
$1M?   Geez, how much would it cost if they'd actually painted it?    ;-)
I am going to guess why this guy imported this. I believe middle eastern markets have near identical regulations to that of America. I remember Doug reviewed a Ferrari 599 got from the middle east
Omg a centanario
I was going to buy this but I ended up getting a Toyota Camry instead
A lot of plastic in the interior for a million.
If you cover up the hood and look at middle and back half of the car is looks like a 2010 Chevy Malibu 😂😅
Hey
*Doug trying to show the doors staying put anywhere*  *door tries to close itself*
11:48  wrinklez...... unacceptable quality
New Ford Explorer grill and headlight design.
To bad its math black
Booo
whichever designer team proposed this idea to the production team at aston martin gave them lots of hope
A Ford Focus who went to college in Europe.
Front looks like an accord
Traf means something that is very old like a old vase not something luxurious
Past three weeks have been fantastic content..
FYI: "Taraf" pretty much means gypsy band.  Pretty stupid name for a THE MOST EXPENSIVE LUXURY SEDAN, if you ask me.
Hell no would I be letting kids ride in this car.
What makes it cost a million dollars? Mark up.
wait that fridge button is from a mercedes
I wouldnt even pay a million dollars for this in gta
Why do the backseats have better tech than the front?
The phantom is way better with better features for almost half price
I truly didn’t know the Centenario was real until the sneak peek on the new review. I 100% thought that was a Forza car.
A million dollars and you still gotta sit with the fact that the $60k Dodge next to you at the stoplight has an extra 100hp over you. I know they're different animals, but for seven figures, you'd think you could get it all. Really a beautiful car, though. The front isn't very distinctive, but the overall shape is unmistakable. They did a fantastic job on the exterior design.
So it's the perfect car to slam trough a Gucci boutique window during a peaceful protest?
The steering wheel looks like a 90's Toyota
Watch as they turn it into a police car in Dubai
Waited for something to justify that pricetag but nothing came. Just more leather. It's a beautiful car yes but a mil? 🤷🤷
Extremely underwhelming car.
I'm surprised about the praises for the styling. It looks kinda like two different cars glued together. It's distinctive for sure but far from beautiful.
..So it's essentially a re bodied Rapide
Mercedes s class is much luxurious and beautiful than this
“In back”
But the rolls royce phantom 8 is one of the most powerful,beautiful, quitest, and finest motor ever created
The amount of genuine leather in that interior just makes me upset & annoyed.
The world's most expensive Hyundai genesis90/equus kit car.
The front looks like dodge dart
I smell depreciation
_Austin martin after 2 months of 0 sales,_ *"Its just a prank bro.."*
No rear ventilated seats for a car meant to be sold exclusively in the middle east? For a million dollar car I'd expect that to be included. Strange.
I prefer to think that a Ford focus has a million dollar cars turn signal stock
This doesn't really look like the world's most expensive sedan. Not very many features; tech that looks like it's from 2010, not 2018; interior that is pretty much indistinguishable from a rapid; and an exterior that just looks like a concept car from 2007. Value: 1
That front plastic saudi licence plate holder better be removable because it fucks up the grill’s look pretty decently
Rapid GT?
The only car that can make a Rolls Royce look economical 🤦🏻‍♂️
I would see my self farting in this while getting Cruised at 300km/h
I would rather buy a fully specced-out Porsche panamera and have 800k left in my pocket.
Isn’t thst where TJ hunt used to take his car for pictures? And didn’t he get his lambo from ogara? Doug, get in touch with tj and review his collection lol
Doug, you kept mentioning the DB9, when I think you mean to compare it to the DB11, no? Even the picture you showed when comparing the grille was a DB11.
The Teraf, charges a million dollars, doesnt bother to cover the back of the dorm room refrigerator they stick in the back.
Rolls royce is better.
This
0:44 ... Hello hottest 🔥
If you ask me you can kind of see the influence from the OG Lagonda
The matte black paint makes it look so extremely cheap it's unreal... I don't understand why people like matte paints so much?
Doug the cuts on your hand are healing nicely.
This is what the Rapide should have been.
I once found a laganda under my bed, it was scary!
From the front it looks like those futuristic mercedes concept cars.
Not worth for 1 million dollar
Look out Doug, the kids don't like full size luxury bespoke sedans. They care about lambos and ferraris
No Doug, No. you sold out big time. Why are you still wearing T-shirts? That’s not you anymore.
I whant 2 see the Centenario Doug...
The front end looks like a new Honda Accord 🤮
Ford Mondeo....
Would be lovely to see Doug review an Aston One-77 if he ever gets the chance. That is probably the most beatiful car ever made.
This thing look hideous from the outside
One mill forrr thiss shitttt like wtfff
First
Throwback to the old old old leganda
It looks like a Genesis
Honda Accord front end
Suddenly Rolls-Royce seems to be a bang for the buck!
What an ugly car
Completely forgot how good looking the Mazda 3 is!
Its not traaaaf its 3 letters TRF and you pronounce it , as it is trf but here its still the Rolls What they like
for a million dollar car i think the back seats can even have cooled seats and massage seats
When I saw it in the last video Cars and Bidz commercial I thought... Hey, that looks like a great value south east asian full size sedan
It's gorgeous but I don't know if it's worth $1000000
am i the only one that thinks it looks like the honda accord headlights?
Looks like accord from the front
Matt black looks crap.  Why do that ?  Only kids and rappers would like it.
Not a million bucks sorry
The Fisker Karma is the best looking sedan ever made.
"Most beautiful car ive seen" Doug that literally looks like a Honda Accord
From the front it's surprising similar to the new Accord
I’m surprised Doug didn’t mention Tyler Hoover when he talked about the Rapide and how common they are...
Imagine getting into an accident with this car
This is the only million dollar car rappers don’t have knowledge on. This is pure class not hype.
The seat belt buckle leather thingy looks like foreskin
Lagonda is a more luxurious brand, as part of one of the most luxurious brands in the world - Aston Martin.. wtf
WHAT is that hunk of plastic on the front of the front grill? The front license plate holder? It's a crime to design a beauty like this and not account for license plates. Hopefully it goes somewhere that doesn't require front plates and this plastic can be removed (and burned).
It definitely doesn't feel like a 1m luxury car but rather a future generation Camry
does not look that good (and that's my kind of car) not that luxurious not reliable not really fast or fun a single cluch?  what? Plastic crap from ford? a bunch of outdated crap  I don't see this being worth even a fifth of what they are asking. You'd be really only paying for exclusivity, and that to me is the worst reason to spend money. That is a car I would't want to buy even if I could. I't almost insulting.
Looks like a skinny dodge charger
Petition for Doug to visit jay leno’s garage
The grill looks like Emil from Nier after he fused with his super-weaponized sister and became a wizard skeleton.
Man. That's really beautiful.
1mio Dollar car with cheap rims
Love Aston but this is so not worth it
The front grill and lights look like a more fancy Honda Accord
You gotta review the Centenario for sure!
“Hide the crappiness.” I like it.
Best looking sedan ever... Ugh... Very boring.  The Stinger looks better.  Even the Charger looks better.  So boring.
If the Genesis G90 and Honda Accord had a baby
Hmmm front looks like a Ford fusion 🤔🤔🤔
Has a 2018 < Accord front style, not a bad thing , just something familiar
How much did Aston Martin give you to call this glorified Genesis the most beautiful sedan of all time, Doug?
There are so many amazing cars street parked in London. I saw a Lambo parked next to an Aston Martin that was parked next to a RR parked next to another RR. I also saw a Porsche Carrera GT street parked. London is crazy for cars, especially considering how terrible the streets are.
Wow this is one of the nicest background of a video in a while
After seeing the electronics it's worth only 200-300k. Because it's only body you are buying.
Notes of Hyundai and Dodge distinguish this automobile.  The grace and dignity of the Charger is visible at the rear.
Overpriced
I saw a Lagonda Taraf in Mexico City and I must admit it looks stunning in the flesh
Gauges cluster, steering wheel, center console and infotainment system are garbage for $1M car. You kidding me.
Nice Accord
Model S is less. That rhymes
At this point I’m more than convinced that the rich are only going to buy it to show off cuz that shit aint worth 1 mill
Can you review a Aston Martin DB5 please!
When are you going to review Centanario ?
That owner at the stop light who'll laugh at a phantom will be brought to his wits once a sweptail owner looks down upon him
That door hydrologic thing is the most dopest  thing I’ve seen!!!😲
Can't explain how frustrated I am just because of the fact that rediculous cars like that exist and what is more frustrating is the fact that there are people who buy those cars. For that price they should make all the switches and levers and turnsignal sticks from gold/silver/aliminium/titanium... The level of absurdism is just all over the top...
It's super UGLY!!
The front looks like my Honda Accord a little lol
23:37 even the sound deadening mat inside the hood has a beautiful decoration :o that's what I'd call true attention to detail.
there is a reason why its only 2018 and not built anymore
This is so not that beautiifull...
Lol ridiculously overpriced
look like a new accord remade by aston
Is that an Xpel stealth wrap or is that stock matte paint?
What?! Taraf means edge or side in arabic not luxury 😅
I just wan a C7 😔😪
Hey Doug, it’s pronounced ta(rough) in Arabic 😬
Honda Accord lookin ass 1 million dollar and you don’t even have shaved door you get that big 1999 key hole
10:01 the way Doug says EXACTLY: EGGIZATLY
This is a beautiful car! But, the centre console, the key push thing are all again taken straight out of an Aston Martin of the period! Come on, Doug!
This is the nicest Maserati I’ve ever seen.....
*just cuts to centenario roadster
is it my wrong feeling , Why this car front look like current New Honda Accord design hahaha  One Million Dollars car man!
The rear looks like a Chevy product to me. At that point, you are paying for exclusivity.
One of the ugliest Astons, heck to me the exterior looks well....not good
If batman had a luxury car
Your knees!!!! Nooooo!
I'm not sure if I'm in the right tax bracket to watch this video.
That is a terrible paint job for that car though...
That interior has cheap buttons in it
FROM THE TAAAHRAAAAAFF
Taraf in Arabic means Party by the way. This was definitely made for Rich Saudi boys lol
Cars  and Bids is such a Doug type of name...
Aston Martin releases 1M$ sedan, RR: Write that down !
I'm wondering why it has an arabic name. Didn't know if it was intentional or if it was another word in a different language.
I’d rather pick a fully specd e class amg or s class amg
The a pillar never ends😂😂
Nice Dodge Charger...
Why would someone buy that instead of a phantom, Doug doesnt even have enough leg room
I don't think you mentioned what year this car came out
The power outlet cover in the rear console looks the exact same as the one in the 2009 ford ranger I had
This car is more expensive then my house
Nothing about it justifies the 1 million dollar price tag.
back when i had hair, i had that problem
This is not 1mil $ car. For 1mil Brabus will give you Maybach limo with 900hp modified v12 :)
"Most expensive luxury sedan ever"  *Has literal iPads for screens in back*
more like Asten Marton Uglyond  Awful!
Cars and bids section of the video is a trailer for future videos.
Doug, tnx for always converting units :-)
Pratically a rapid!!! More longer with diferent shape and badge that cost 1mln.....🤨
Am I The only one who didn’t know this thing existed
Sweeeettt! Can you do the new Genesis SUV looks sick also!
Skip to 3:26 for the actual review
Let's be real here. The real reason this car was produced was for Middle Eastern royalty. All the features are for entertaining the rich. The original buyer of these cars probably didn't even drive them himself.   Still an awesome car and an awesome review.
Best looking my ass. It looks like a modified funeral car..
10:29 doug is losing his hair faster than a porsche 992 turbo s can go from 0 to 60
Sorry how much does it cost again?
Thanks O'gara and Doug for getting your hands on one of these to show us!
Can't believe Doug didn't call them out for that giant chunk of blank plastic around the rear air con controls! This car is a disgrace. It's just like the 2000's Maybach, not elevated enough from its donor car, whereas Rolls-Royce give you a completely different car than a 7 Series for half the money.  Shame Aston, shame.
I like luxury sedan reviews
It looks like the 2021 hyundai elantra from the front
Doug you better be doing a review of that Centenario later man lol
Now who didn't pause the video when they saw they CENTENARIO
This would have been better - 'this is the ugliest car Aston Martin ever produced'
Nonsense car
Im an arab and taraf does not means ultimate luxury
This damn car is not worth a million the are nicer cars for a fraction of the price
ugly wheels, a year 2080 passat wannabe, god forgive me for the neurons ive lost typing this comment ....
The details quality of this car is hilarious and it can be as rare as it can be, but just for the looks, it is a waste of money.  I would be fine with a model of that on my desk and an S-Class in the driveway.
wow what a waste. so there it says Lagonda on the front and read logo instead of aston martin? i will pay 800k extra for that the genesis has more character, luxury and reliability than this piece of british scrap. Seriously? they give you two ipads for a million dollar????
this car looks very boring, this looks like a forbidden child from a 2007 ford Mondeo and and Aston martin i would take a Bentley continental GT over this any day.
This literally looks like a Genesis
It's amazing how fast technology changes and makes everything look obsolete
it's one of the ugliest cars i've ever seen
Doug's knees are hard-core. Kneeling on pavement like it's nothing
Next video on Centenario.
Ah yes, the million dollar car gets a 4 in value.
If I paid a million dollars for a car and it came with those boring interiors, that infotainment system and specially that steering wheel, I would kill myself
10:03 "stay exactly there no matter where you put it"     Lagonda: nope          Doug inside: Fuck don't put me in an awkward position
Looks like the real world copied GTA for once.
Return of the king
Can you review my wife ? she is a 93 with low miles
So looking forward to the video Doug makes with the Koningsegg Gemera 😃.  Thanks for the video and stay safe ✌️
I think Ill buy a Rolls Royce and a house instead
I'm wondering why anyone would want this over a Rolls or a Bentley. Normally, the answer would be "exclusivity" but "a Lagonda" isn't going to impress anyone and at this price you could probably get a coachbuilder to make your Rolls or Bentley a one-of-a-kind showpiece.
the rear armrest is damped on the way down, I don't think you spoke about that enough Doug. Jk jk.
Joke
"best looking sedan"...  laughs in kia k5.
3:27 DWARF DEMURO
So.... it's just a slightly longer Rapide..? I'd expect much more for a million.
I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Wait, 2018 is from another "era"???
RR phantom is way better than this
A half hour Aston Martin Advertisement 😂👏🏼
Front headlights look like a modern Honda Accord from the side
You say it's luxurious but I see zero Harley Davidson badging so I have to disagree. Also where is the cool orange striping pff bust.
Doug, this is a nice looking 4 door but you may have overlooked the true nicest looking sedan, the 2007-08 Acura TL type-s a-spec
He shaved in a rush :D
Headlights look like a dodge charger
This car better have James Bond inside it
The interior is gorgeous i cant lie and nether can you
It’s nice but not 1 million dollars nice... I think the phantom or even the maybach is better for the money.... you could have 2 phantoms or 5 s600s.... it doesn’t even have seat a/c..... or back seat infotainment.... not worth 200k let alone 1m
Doug is the kind of guy who only eats bananas.
My name is Yeet master 96
So you pay 1 million for stitching...
jesus what an ugly steering wheel
Doug is the type of guy to kneel on the ground before the car  8:50
Looks like an avarage 80k maserati quattroporte
The front looks like the front of a Honda Accord
😳😳😳
The way you spell (TARAAF) is wrong, you mentioned it is an Arabic word (means luxury) but say it faster like taraf not (TARAAAFF)
Front end looks like a Honda accord tbh
I’m looking forward to seeing your review of the 2020 Ford Bronco
Interesting decision to leave that front license plate mounting bracket on during your review lol.
Priced at $1m because Saudi's have more money than sense
the Rapide is better looking, sorry daddy Doug
get a dodge charger scat pack if your not too iterested in features
Aston be like here see the door trick.. Me n my homies Uh huh so that's good worth a mil
GUYS ACTUALLY CHECK OUT CARS AND BIDS SHIT IS MADDD CHEAP ON THERE  SOMEONE IS ABOUT TO GET A MCLAREN 720S (WITH OPTIONS) for 110k
A Rapide L for 6x the price
Looks 10/10 Rest of it is totally not worth it
Aston Martín is Berry impresionant
This car doesn't scream one miliin dollar it isn't worth it
This looks like something michael would drive in gta V.
next video : thissssss is a Lamborghini centenario......and it is the most cool Lamborghini.....
please clean your knees next time before entering a luxurious car :)))
He must've got paid by Aston Martin to say this is the most beautiful 4 door car..... ever.
Think about it, Volvo has better technology than this car :D
hm.. looks like Peugeot 508
It’s beautiful but also massively overpriced
O........M.......G
For the price and superb looks,  it needs a Hellcat Redeye caliber engine, along with AWD.  If FCA (Chrysler) can do it, then Lagonda can.  The JGC Trackhawk is a half ton heavier than this but out accelerates it to 60mph by a full second !
This car is so ugly!  1. Small wheels compared to many luxury car especially my love Bentley 2. Weird side shape, clearly the ugliest part of this car. Why rectangular butt line and raise up a little and thin?? And no aston family design feature can be seen from this car 3. The logo tries to be some “more luxury than aston” logo but it only becomes extremely similar to genesis.  Personally I like RR, Bentley and Maybach and normal Aston all. And astons and Bentleys are my favorites, nearly all their cars looked great. But now, this came
How much for that Aston in 10 years time?
Ford Mondeo grill
Front look like honda accord🤣🤣
i feel like this is the perfect car for Gumball
no thanks i’ll take 2 rolls royces
taraf can be more precisely translated to ' overindulgence'
10:01 Doug:  "And it will stay precisely there!"             Door:  Nope
Subtítulos en español por favor
This looks like what the Genesis COULD be
Check Dougs face at 12:30 in the rear passanger screen. Looks like a movie being played along the review 😁
Million dollars for this car ?! Thats insane !! If you asking me this car or 2 phantoms ? defenetly 2 phantoms ..
Next ferrari roma
The aston martin lagonda looks like a mixture between the ford focus and chrysler 200 for 1 million dollars.
That’s a verrry nice beautiful sedan. Not sure it’s a 1 MILLION dollar-nice sedan though particularly on the interior, but hey still happy to maybe one day see “hyper cars” levels of price for luxury instead of sport, that would be kind of a change.
I guess the kenigsegg gemera would be considered a performance sedan so although 4 door and more expensive, not the most expensive luxury saloon
I don't think it's remarkably good looking. It's nice, but I would have given it a 7. It's subjective of course.
That dashboard design is stuck in 2005.
The only car that ever got a 10/10  for styling
It still looks like a concept car and its still in its concept phase rather than an actual production car. Looks great without a doubt but the price is kinda too much imo
It wouldn’t be Aston Martin without a hideous interior colour.
The dirty knees touching the leather just cringes me
Rolls Royce still best
Idk what youre seeing thats the most bland looking car I've seen over 25k
Bro get a haircut.
Looks like the polestar s60
The front looks like a Hyundai Elantra
In India you get rolls Royce ghost for above million dollar 🤑
Peace of garbage
Looks like it has i8 headlamps
13:03 “Take a look at this pattern, these circles and dots between them...”  It’s called broguing Doug, this is like the knurling all over again 😆
million dollars and no sunroof? ok
Doug's out here reviewing million dollar card while I can't even afford a toy model of one of those 😢😢😢
So Aston Martin basically scammed 120 people out of a million dollars?
It looks like a charger
I'm sorry Doug 😞! But unfortunately, this is the worst episode since 2013 on this channel!
Front looks like it was a child of Mondeo and Audi A7
I swear it looks like a 2019 Honda Accord  in the front
Looks like a scam targeted at rich oil princes with way too much money by slapping the exclusivity tag on it. 1m$ for reused parts from a focus and some leather? No wonder it it wasn't sold in the rest of the world, nobody would buy it.
Ah a car for the hottest region on the planet, lets paint it matte black.
just think the value of this car in next 15 years it will be in a meuseum
Most gorgeous sedan I've ever seen, one of the most gorgeous cars I've ever seen.  Doug: Gets in with dirty knees.  Seriously though, thanks for this, had no idea it existed and the bar for luxury sedan styling has been raised beyond anything I could have imagined.
Aston need to invest in their designs
The word "Overpriced" is an understatement in this context.
looks like an 90s crysler... probably just as shitty.  the glass in the b pillar is gay.
How come this does not have a value of 1 ....
From outside looks futuristic but inside looks lame and boring. No screens no touch screen just plain 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦
Literally just announced 150 news cars - already sold out
this design could work if it had been a two-door car. It is way too long. It almost looks like it has been photoshopped for a meme.
🤔...😒..naw I'll just get a  Rolls-Royce or even Bentley for a fraction of the price 🤷🏾‍♂️
If they sold this for 200,000 it could have saved their money issues
No sunroof??
This review feels like doug fell for the limited edition bait, objectively it's not cool, not that special looking and massively overpriced. If this doesn't get a 3 or lower in value I don't know what does.
Apparently a car being worth a million doesn't stop Doug leaning on the paintwork.... >_>
I want this
Dougs the type of guy to review a Lagonda in a multi level parking garage
Dougy daddy d
10 in styling for a car with a Hyundai grill and Jaguar taillights? U strippin’ Doug. 🤔🧐🤯
When Aston Martin, an expensive luxury/sports car company, has a luxury version of their vehicles...
Why is it matte black? Ugly AF
Yeah not buying it.
I have to make decision: Buy the Ashton Martin or buy a well established food franchise. Still doing research on both their Ashton Marin and the franchise.
Instead of thinking "this aston has a ford focus turn signal?!" You can look at it as "hey, did you know my ford focus has the same turn signal as a million dollar car?"
I would openly mock anyone who bought something so ugly.
".......cars from this era!" bro it's two years old.
More like LaHonda Accord front exterior 🤣😂
Looks like an overpriced Ford Taurus
i dont see anything worth a million about this car Bently And RR look way better than this
But can it park itself😯
E Class Mercedes is better than this car. Doug? What is the matter with you?
This looks like the null car in forza horizon 4
The Chinese knockoff will cost 50K. Soon!
Who didnt expected that price tag in first sight?
Does it look like an anteater?
The rear end is gorgeous, but the rest is awkward and plain, to me.
I I have a million to spend in a luxury car, I’d buy a Mercedes S Class Maybach LWB fully equipped
I love this car, so beautiful...but it seems like the sort of thing you'd have bought a few years ago for $350,000 and that would maybe be worth half that now. A million bucks? I think not.
This is the most blatantly cynical car I have ever seen.
It got nothing on the E38... Not worth 1M, not by a long shot...
Not worth the million bucks, no auto trunk lid, infotainment is severely lacking( tiny ass screen), lacking in features, unless you wanna pay for bragging rights, I’d rather get the rolls, and with what I have left over a Porsche 911 turbo s
If you think this car is beautiful, you Play way too much GTA
That's a beautiful car... Edit: the car and price lost me on the front review.. wow.. Ford parts surrounded by leather for $1mln?!?!
Too bad they could not keep in it production and add an SUV with the same look.
Wow, taraf in Arabic means the high end of luxurious, it means being rich not like Cristiano Ronaldo but the one who pays him.
it's cool & all but is it really worth 2 RR phantoms?
Dougs the type of guy to leave an empty soda can inside of a million dollar car to roll around. Kinda sounds like it in the turns 24:16 25:00
That Lamborghini 🤯
not worth 1 mil tbh
Someone has to say it... the front fascia and side profile reminds me of the 10th gen accords
When I herd 1 million I spit my water out
When a car is reviewed by Doug DeMuro the price of that very car goes higher.
Now on Craigslist for $9,995 with ice cold AC.
Am I the only one who finds this car outrageously ugly for its price? Ii literally looks like a genesis that went to the gym
I didn't know this car existed  And I'm a car guy
1 million and the room even tho it’s nice isn’t glass ??? I’d want it entirely glass at the top
Never thought you could pull up and see some Rolls Royce riding peasants
I would buy a phantom and a mulsanne 100% before I would buy this horrible car this actually made me dislike Aston Martin as a brand being that all their models use old Mercedes navigation which is outrageously outdated to use in 2020
Looks like the new ford taurus from the front and a little bit like dodge charger from the back
But why is it a million?
Nice Mondeo! 😁
This car is just a cashgrab for aston about half of the stuff is just ripped from other models sure, its nice and comfy, but arent the rapides nice and comfy like that? they just went to the parts bin and were like "lets just use these parts for the interior" then they were like "eh whatever we can shell out the money to make a new exterior were gonna make it back hiuwfuiwefhuiwewefuhi"      pls know this is a joke before u attack me thanks
Doug has Kevlar knees
When is this centanario roadster review coming
This is perhaps one of the worst ways you could spend 1 million dollars. This shit is less luxurious than a Porsche Panamera from 2016😬
Wasn’t lagonda the internet mistress from Napoleon dynamite?
the design language is similar to the vulcan
3.7million subs and still recording with an iphone 8...
This thing is an ancient gemera on the inside ngl
Roll out a Lagonda to the UAE, Dubai, Qatar when you need to make up for poor sales. Oil and slave money never runs out there ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
10:03 😂😂
In what universe is this car worth a million USD lmao
Cool
Is it just me or has everyone NEVER seen a FAMILY in a luxury sedan like an S-Class or a Phantom? Like a dad driving, mom in the passenger seat and their 5 year olds in the back.
My favorite sedan, for that kind of money  I would wish a manual was available. Not like Aston Martin hasn't done that before to retrofit a manual to an automatic car, like the V12 Vanquish. The keys are made of sapphire, not glass.
Review some Volvos please
I am confused why they chose to call it that name. (Taraf) or (ترف) actually is a negative name in Arabic, it is not a thing to be proud of.
For a sec I thought doesn't It look 'AR'ish from its rear end........
Nothing says that you're serious about selling luxury cars and making money like selling everywhere but the United States.
cars and bids just seems like a BAT knock off
Finally! I've been waiting for this review! Thanks Doug!
This look like low polygon count Aston Martin Rapide
"The doors stay right where you put them"  Uhh, ever heard of infinity hinges? My Mk7 R doors do the same thing. This may be the most over priced car ever built.  Edit: so it is an uglier Rapide with some different badges for 5 times the price. Some people have more money than taste or sense.
"it's Aston Martin's luxury brand"   Me: ... Huh
it may cost a million dollars, but it's no where near worth a million dollars.
Rolls-Royce: are you challenging me!?
..this is not beautiul.... it looks like a charger had a baby with a s2000
Imagine a 5 year old needing all of that luxury.
SUX 6000 anyone?
I once saw one of these in Dubai in a building parking, caught my attention, but i would never have guessed it cost $1million. I
Tell me this is a prankk.. i love aston martin i mean who doesn't but this is 🤮🤮🤮
I'm not rich enough to even look at one but if I had money to buy a luxury sedan I would get a rolls Royce
Can't believe they just stuck that keyhole there on the driver door.
Looks like a retarded ford fusion.
looks sick
First thing I thought off when he got in the car. . So many cows
"Here's what's wrong with the cheapest Lagonda Taraf in America"
fancy acura tl you got there
Yo what was that Lambo at the beginning?
“So how much leather do you want?” Aston Martin - “Yes”
It's only a million dollars because of its rarity. I'd rather have a Phantom.
It’s a chopped Ford Fusion.
Most expensive g90
That 1987 Lagonda was the first Doug DeMuro video I had seen!!!
At least there’s a white one in Mexico City (North America)...
Headlights look like a new accord
I am truly inspired from you Doug, you are an awesome narrator with vast knowledge.💟 And I have a request, if you find my comment from thousands then please try to make a review of a car from any one of Indian car manufacturers.
Doug you might wanna test yourself for covid19 since you gave this car a 10 for styling
This is garbage as compared to a Phantom. Overpriced.
Nice Dodge Charger
Tremendously WIDE & FLAT  -doug in his other lagonda review
Taraf "ترف" in arabic means : profusion / exaggeration in luxury
Doug the type of guy to bark at a dog
My $11k lincoln has more features than this thing 😂
Thisssssst
22:44 million dollar car that runs on Unleaded
Who is expecting comments about dougs clothing reviewing a 1 million dollar car
It really pays to be early to these videos because of the comments 😂😂😂. They will soon get lost in the thousand of comments by others but these are the true GOAT comments 😂😂😂😂
lagondana
Everything was going so great until the rapide nd ford interior stuff came along Really disappointed 😑😑
No One Is Talking About The Lamborghini Centenario
The front looks like a Ford Taurus or even a Fusion
So basically it's a fatter, more luxurious and dramatic Rapide with a million-dollar price tag and Lagonda badges on it. Well played, Aston Martin
i wish the interior is black mix with red or white.
doug , trust me you dont have to give the car to me  , but doug its soo expemsive
The kind of car that makes me proud to be British. 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
I have to buy the iPads? Deal breaker.
Just gonna put it out there, the front looks like the accord
Am I the only who thinks the car looks kinda ugly and outdated?
Stole the grill/headlight design from the Honda Accord.
The front face looks like a Honda Accord
That thing looks like something you’d see in GTA5
I saw the car in the thumbnail and immediately thought, “how the hell did he find one of those in the US?????”
i can imagine this thing selling for like a $100000 after a decade or so......
I don't care what anyone says, Aston Martins are way overpriced cars. And then why would someone prefer this car to a rolls Royce. Rolls royce look more OG.
A million dollar vehicle designed for the Middle East without cooled seats? Seems like an obvious miss
May be its costliest car with a design that looks sooooooooo cheap
For a million bucks this car is just an embarrassment. Platform of a DB9 (Fraction of the price of this car), interior of Rapide („“), stocks from a Ford (😂). But hey, leather on your ceiling and some different looking lights and grill. GIVE ME YOUR MONEY!
The backwards tachometer at 18:42 isn’t actually that unusual anymore. A lot of new cars are starting to adopt that.
front looks like a ford fusion
Please stop sweating in my Lagonda!
What a horrific looking car. Front looks like a Ford Fusion and the back looks like a GTA version of an Aston Martin. Let’s not even get started on how it looks from the side 😂
For all the people comparing it with VARIOUS other cars. Well, this is how the Previous LAGONDA looked and that's no stolen design. Id still want a Sunroof though
Wakanda giraffe
So. So. So. So. So. Fucking. Beautiful. Dear god!
I dunno, I think it looks ugly
Beautiful car for hauling rich pretentious a holes. Gatsby would be proud.
The front of it looks okay but overall it's pretty ugly by Aston Martin standards. At least it's better looking than the original Lagonda.
Oh baby centanario is coming
Lincoln for non-boomers
This car might go down in history as the most depreciated car ever
I mean, it looks ok... the C pillar looks like it doesn’t fit the rest of the car. I think the new 4 door Civic looks better.
Garmin navigation? No thanks....
The headlights looks like they are from a Honda accord.
This just looks like a mesh between a genesis G90 and a Ford Fusion
Could you do a 20 blazer and 21 trailblazer
I see literally nothing making this a million dollar car. I'd much rather drive a rolls, seems to offer much more luxury for a already too high of a price. Let alone this one. You really pay for the exclusivity, which sells very well indeed in saudi arabia. Nice stitching you find in much cheaper luxury cars, the small features like soft closing, fridge etc as well.
1 million USD gives you a car... and of course 2 IPad’s, wow that’s luxury
Wait they made a new special edition Taurus?
Mazda 3 :D
it doesn't even have a panoramic roof, leave alone a sunroof
That front end is a Accord hands down lol
This is the car designed to be in a video game that was copied from a real life car but only enough to avoid a lawsuit.
I'm starting to notice that whatever car Doug is standing behind during the Cars and Bids plug is actually a sneak preview of a future review. Saw this Aston last week  in the S500 video
Rear roof is higher to wear headdress
1 million for this car make a rolls looks like a bargain actually....
We need a fuel system, no cap 😤🧢
I honestly fail to comprehend what justifies such a price tag.
Doug DeMuro, Please explain to these fools who don't know Autoindustry Ford stole the front of the Aston Martin car.
A British company that makes a million dollar sedan made for the ultra rich in the middle east has its roots in small town Ohio. Very cool!
Is Cars and Bids prominent in Canada?
I wonder if there were security guards or body guards nearby.
The grill looks like it’s from a mazda
You are teasing us toooo much. Please upload video of viper ASAP!!!!!!!!
Doug is spoiling his own content !
4:44  that exposed keyhole though...why, on a million dollar car, could they not hide that?
Beautiful in the "it's got a great personality" type of way.
does it look like a ford fusion in the front
Am I the only one who found this car ugly 🧐
Um um....it’s ugly, like really ugly.
A bentley flying spur out beats this entirely. The fact this car is worth 1 mil and doesnt look that luxury appealing to me is a problem
the front end looks like a sonata
cars and *its.com
Btw “ Taraf” in Arabic means “luxury” 😉
a lexus es is better considering the cost and a bmw 7series is way better that the lagonda
Verry Ugly Interior
interior is kind of dissapointing... I think the Citroën's C4 spacetourer's interior looks better :D
Just from the outside it looks worth about 100k MAX
Im starting to see why they didn't sell many to the western world. Pretty car. Not worth more than a Bentley or a Rolls. Kind of disappointed. I'd also like to point out that a company shouldn't charge more for rarity. It should be up to the market to decide what a car should cost due to rarity. The way Aston has done this has caused a stupid large profit margin. Its dumb. Dumb car for dummy people
Good!
I dont know why but when he says "FOR the entire PLANET" it sounds way more serious then WORLD
Not worth the price
This car really made me angry at how ridiculously overpriced it is. A Maybach costs 1/4th of this and everyone who has seen a Maybach inside knows how incomparably more luxurious it is.
Weird American pronunciation of Lagonda is LAGANDA.
please, search youtube for "taraf", it's not what you think but it will be amazing
Finally, the awesome Taraf!
How much does it cost?
I’m really hyped for the centenario review
1st time i dont agree with doug at all . This car is ugly , so ugly , strikingly ugly
Why do people like that flat black paint? It looks like bad spray paint...I have never seen a car it looks good on.
At a million dollars I would expect everything to be bespoke.  So triggered at that turn signal....
Not worth a million bucks , not in the least. This car's worth 300-400 grand tops, Aston Martin must have had a large clientele of rich Arabs who were  ready to shell out that much money on a stupid sedan . Not so in Western countries , rightly so .
It's ترف not تراف
Am I the only one who felt the mazda 6 style in the front end
It’s truly a billionaire’s car, lowkey, luxurious, and expensive. 🥵
Except your exaggerated tone nothing is justified for million dollar ...
This car is perfect for a pimp!
hideous paint choice, should be glossy metallic imo...
What a rip off
Look like the back of it was took from the dodge Challenger. When you look at it from the side. The rear end looks just like it
Whats up with your views bro?
Aston Martin is the kind of brand to have a luxury sub brand
am I the only one who sees 2020 Sonata + Genesis G90?
Umbrella handle leather doesn't match the interior.  Crap!
10:02 lol no doug, it doesnt stay
Wow, I'm so surprised. How were you able to get this thing.... Because they are rare.
All that yammering and spectrumy peacocking and he didn't even mention the demi-matte paint? Jeez.
Mkbhd like this car because of its colour
Sick looking Ford Fusion!
You stick the nozzle in, the pump would never fit in that tiny hole.
Anyone who actually paid $1m for this got scammed. It's a truly pathetic attempt at a luxury car when you compare it to other (much cheaper) Rolls/Bentley offerings.
Astons trademark grill came first and Genesis and Hyundai/Ford have developed similar looking grills and people are blaming Aston for the design that THEY pioneered
I'm confused why this car costs as much as it does. The engine is the same as the DB9, the seats are the same as the Rapide (even if they've got fancy Brogue on them), and the controls and infotainment are the same as other Aston Martins. To me the only feature you're really getting is the design and exclusivity. I know cars are worth whatever someone is willing to pay... but still...
Didn’t know Aston Martin had sedans
Doug the type of guy to get excited about door hydraulics
yeah, makes sense, all of the rich people in the middle east, they buy cars, and buy drivers to drive them around in em i dont understand
Next time you say 1 MILLION DOLLARS, put your pinky finger against your bottom lip.
Is is just me, or he's kinda stopped going to CNC?
1million??!? It's a scam!! Give me a 2014 panamera e hybrid + 970 .000$
Who else would pull the ash tray out, sell it for crazy money and use the space as a cupholder instead?
Douglas, the motor is 5.9L actually. don’t let the label trick you
Doung probably means another car that is behind the camera...
Hedious looking car . 1 million dollars just for leather . Third class technology and third class build quality for car cost 1 million dollars worth .
I don't know if this is the most beautifully smooth sedan ever or the most unimpressive one for that price tag.
Alcohol poisoning = Having a drink every time Doug says "million dollar car".
toyota:
this has to be the most boring car I've ever seen
centenario review coming up !!
Doug, please review the Alfa Romeo 159.
So one of these or a Phantom and 500K? I think that's a no brainer.
2018 so worlds most expensive hoooptie?
Review a 2007 hyundai tiburon if not u dont care kobe bryant died
Wife: “Honey can we talk now?” Husband: “Just a sec, Doug is reviewing God’s car”.
Arab here, ترف means luxury in Arabic but it's mostly used as a negative. Extreme show off of luxury is frowned upon and that word is used to describe precisely that.
For the car guys, he pops the hood at 22:53
How to make a million dollar car for established manufacturers:  Just make a concept car go into production
Kind of stupid to put heated seats in a car they only wanted to sell in Dubai. Like I get it but does it get cold there?
HATE the color. HATE IT! Why, how did that become a trend?
Ridiculously over priced.
“a lot of cars from this era had”   that was two years ago, Doug
I see an Accord front end.
Fond Infotainment looks like AliExpress Ipad Holder
rather get a phantom 8 for the price
That doesn't sound Arabic name ..  Because I speak Arabic 🤔
I’d rather have a 1st gen Acura legend.
Doug the type of guy to get on his knees for a swan-hinged four door sedan
worst car sales ever
I've always wanted an in-depth review on one of these and never thought I'd actually see one.  Well whir me back into my home and slam me around like an old Maserati!  Thanks Doug.  You done me a solid.  *fistbump*
It looks like a luxury dodge charger at first glance
The Rapide Parts in the interior are quite a disapointment
Looks like an uglier Hyundai Genesis
I could see $100K maybe but not a $million.  Maybe if it had a decent paint job and wasn't that ugly primer color....
a milllion dollars?cmon
Fusion in the front and impala from the side gtfo
The car is nice and all but it is very overpriced . It is not even worth a five hundred thousand dollar
Centenario review coming up😂
Think Doug uses Patchouli deodorant?
10:00 Doug: and it will stay exactly there!🙄 Me: NO! It won't! 😅😅
The driving experience is "meh" also....and it is the most expensive sedan because its so rare? double "meh" I pass. thank you - you made the right point.
wow the centenario!
Not Softclose?
Very cool video Doug!
Sweating in 1.000.000$ car ... Maybe open windows for fresh air and wipe all sweat :D
Am from Kenya anybody who can help me import IT
The front looks like the new Honda accord 😂
Doug has to be the first guy to sit in this car whos not wearing a 3 piece suit
Are you sure this car worth 1,000,000 $
I think the front looks beautiful but just hate the profile of this car. Something just feels off.
No 3rd brake light?
0:37 Jesus Christ, and I thought the Lagonda Taraf took me by surprise! Holy hell!
the front looks kinda like a hyundai sonata
The most beautiful sedan E V E R made.
Wow that's a nice looking Hyundai
Eddig azt sem tudtam, hogy ez az autó egyáltalán létezik.
So pretty on the outside...So disappointing on the inside with the rear legroom and the bad navi system. Just goes to show more money does not mean a better car.. Rolls knows whats up
I'm confused. Does the Lagonda come with two iPads or not?
So since u were standing next to a centenario does that mean we get a video of it soon?
Centenario is coming 🔥
i don’t think tyler is gonna find one of these on kansas
1m for what ???
I don't like this non metallic paint.
so is nobody gonna talk about the centenario teaser he gave in the start??
Mkbhd like this car because of its colour
So are we just going to ignore the centenario?
This is a switch bike, this is a switch bike, no this is a switch bike, THISSSS IS A 2020 ASTON MARTIN LAGONDA 😂
And the Most Rarest Luxury Sedan
1M? Wow
Didn't even remember this existed damn!
last video he had the taraf for promotion, so im guessing the roadster centenario is for the next one
im naked watching this lol 💋
Does anyone know what is connected to that hydraulic cylinder? I can't understand how it can hold the door in all places and yet isn't a pain to open and close by adding a massive amount of friction. Somehow it's able to have a lot of static friction but very low kinetic friction.
0:42 Them:here is my centenario, what do you think about it? Doug:be sure to check out CAAARS AND BIDSSS
Doug better review that centenario 🔥
@MannyKhoshbin tesla replacement?
The interior is the money maker. Imo the exterior is actually hideous. Then again I hate matte paint.
Definitely not worthy of 1 million usd lol
the front end reminds me of an audi, especially that grille shape
Mazda 6 front grill looking ass.
Centenario review coming? 🤔
Unpopular opinion: I think this car is very ugly. Also, the interior is deeply disappointing for a million dollar car. I get the feeling that they charge that price just because they can...
May have been a million dollars, But in my opinion, Worth every penny!
I think it would be cool to demonstrate a car refrigerators capabilities if he has like a can of soda and he puts it in at the beginning and then takes it out nearing the end of the review.
No odometer under the hood 0/10
Honestly this would be dope if they sold it in the US
This is the most underpriced “overpriced” car I have ever seen. Just gorgeous.
Looks like Honda NSX's dad
One of the most overrated car ever
MmmmThisssssss
Idk man, not gonna buy it
So basically, it's a stretched Rapide with a body kit?
At the back it looks like a bently
This is everything the Maserati Quattroporte could be....on the exterior that is. Engine and interior quality is well superior in the AM.
Price and worth are very different concepts. Few cars prove it as much as this one imho...
I’m excited for the Lambo review
The lagonda old is probably one of the most re-watchable video you have, this car was made for this channel to review
THIS
It truly is gorgeous.
No sunroof on a Million Dollar Car??
Certainly not worth 1 mil
The profile view looks like a stretched challenger
At the Peterson museum!  That's so fitting.
Who else noticed the "alright" was missing when he moved inside? :D
Aston martin sedan ? For million dollars??? Bruhhhh how
Isn’t the Gemera the more expensive 4 door?
“One million dollars”  Dr Evil: That’s a lot of money!
Centenario finally coming! 😭❤️🔥
Just wait a year and you'll see asian cars to look exactly like this but with some BMW  Audi parts also
Urm... Apparently I'm the only person who thinks that this car is ugly tho
When did Doug do a review on a centenario
I would take a fully loaded S class AMG over this any day
I saw this in the intro of your S-Class video and I was hoping you were going to do a review.
They put a $50 hydraulic strut to keep the door open? Thats something you see on a bass boat storage compartment. My laptop screen from 2010 can be placed in any position, and after 10 years still somehow stays up and it articulates vertically not horizontally like a car door. Thumbs down La gondon.
I don’t care what anyone thinks, that’s a truly amazing looking sedan.
Someone tell me what they hell are you paying for???
It's beautiful ❤️❤️❤️ 😭😭😭 🔥🔥🔥
14k views, 1.4k likes, 14 minutes ago. Nice👌
Just checked the pricing over here from the "Taraf" it half a million and only one copy is offered.  If iit was one million it dropped half of the value...Rapides start around 50k with a lot of miles on the clock though.
I love how he teases future reviews. This overpriced whale is gorgeous btw
How to steal 1 Mio$ from rich arabs
So cool
If only it didn't have a front plate holder
It’s definitely a cool car, and the lines are beautiful, but the exterior design itself LITERALLY sort of relates to that of a redesigned Honda Accord. Quality is probably way above of course, but still.
Review the centenario
looks like a mazda
Didnt even know this existed
I love how Doug uses his car website plug to let us know whats coming next
2018 Genesis G80 grill...
kinda looks like shit
Will Doug ever review the G650?
C pillar is so disproportionately steeply angled compared to the rest of the car. Ruins the whole thing.
Did anyone else experience an ad every 15-30 seconds?
Overrated car. Would never buy it instead of a Rolls. Doesn't look that great, the interior looks super outdated just like every Aston and doesn't seem on the same level of luxury of a Rolls. Pass
What ever happened to the Aston Martin Virage.
It looks ugly. It looks like a boring concept that wasnt finished from 4 years ago. The rear looks like a fusion with less cool, anf the front looks like a boring take on the charger. The sides look like just another sedan. A 10/10? Give me a break lol..
Early asf. And please, someone gift me a Lagonda Taraf
1 million for this? 🤔😂
first time i’ve ever been here in under 20k views
"most beautiful 4 door car ever"   Front looks like a squeezed Ford Mondeo
Looks like Peugeot
Reliability 0/10
Wish I had 1million dollars...⛹️‍♂️
Honestly, it’s ugly
Lagonda Taraf sounds like a character name from a self-published fantasy novel.
This car is gorgeous but then the C pillar just ruined the look of it
Enjoy our new videos every week 🎥 #weneedyoursupport 😊
I know Doug read these comments sometimes and be like... THIS, sounds like me.
It IS gorgeous ... but it’s not as if the new Flying Spur isn’t also a looker as well
bruh how are you gonna promote cars and bids next to a *centenario* and not review it 😧
Doug the type of guy to read instructions to his new phone
I heard the THISSSS before the video even started
is this the new taurus SHO ?
I'm seeing a trend with the cars he uses to promote cars and bids😂
I would be surprised if this car isn’t sold already. I don’t think there’s a more effective sales pitch than getting a good Doug review. I understand why these dealerships throw cars at him (idk if that’s true.. but it seems like he can get his hands on anything)
Doug is on fire recently
Nice Ford
Saw one of these in a Dubai car showroom. No one even gave it a second look!
Shaken, not stirred...
The next video is gonna be about an awesome Lamborghini. I know this because of the unique quirks and features of Doug's Cars and Bids shoutout videos.
tight in the back ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Nice Fusion !
I dont get it this car straight up looks like a ford fusion
Welp, we know what Lambo review is up next!
that blue centenario roadster was insanely cool
This car proves that a car dont need 50 fake air vents everywhere in the car to look gorgeous or sporty, i hope this tendency die out soon
Start the video then press 0 quickly and repeatedly.  Laugh and thank me later.
I could drive this car.
this looks like a 4 door bmw i8
wild
DAMN !! I have to admit this is a nice looking sedan 💯. Thanx for the video men 💯
Hi Doug im new. Can I get a heart maybe?😂
Sorry but this thing is U-G-L-Y
Not quite Kia Stinger cool but it will do.
Doug,  you are just plain great.
Thats a fuckin beauty
Next review is coming 🤣🤣 on Lamborghini
The windows also roll down several inches so that they don’t stick out that much higher than the roofline of the car, it appears
*doug there is a boeing 747 available on Turo please review it*
The head lights is similar an i8
The front looks like a 2018 honda Accord...
Sheesh, money can't buy taste.
Thhhiiiisss.... is all kinds of awesome!
How do the doors not open for you, the doors handles are literally the same as a 35k model 3
FINALLY
the wheels looks like they cost 30 dollars on ebay...
It looks like the Quartz Regalia from FF
The door stays where you want it, except that one time. Lol
Right near my job. Off Roberson and Olympic
Uh casual Centenario Roadster Doug
Depending on the temperature Doug is between 6'3 - 6'4
Doug is so tall, even on his knees, he is taller than a sedan.
Lancer evolutıon IX, please!
Why even bother buying this for a million when you could get something from the past 120 years of the automobile.. This is not "the best looking car of all time" lol not by a looong shot... Its a chump car
OK..  That Aston Martin looks like the exact copy of the Lamborghini Estoque.
Those wheels legit look like they’re off a Charger lmao the front looks exactly like the outgoing Honda Accord sedan 😵😵😵1 million dollars tho
5:58 the tail lights looks like the ones in the Vulcan
Looks like a Dodge Challenger from the side lol
Taraf (الترف ) in arabic means excess...
Good timing I am about to start my dinner.
last time i was this early was his CTS-V wagon farewell
That's Def a Maserati Quattroporte lol
Because it’s ugly as fook!
a honda accord for 1 million dollars....nice
10:20 I think the Porsche Panamera also has this
More English hand built luxury 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧👍🏻
$1 Million and it's still a piece of junk.
The front grille of the Lagonda reminds me of mouths the appliances have in The Brave Little Toaster
Front looks like an accord.
I see where the current gen Honda Accord gets its front grill from.
Looks a bit like an A8
I think there's something same on the side-silhouette than on Volvo S90...
It’s just not worth 2 rolls Royce phantoms
😎
Looks like a GTA car, something about the exterior proportions and styling looks slightly off
Looks like Ford Taurus made into Aston Martin Lagonda.
Damnnnn this is the car you get just to let people know how much cash you actually have. That font looks so clean, and the rear.. idk i want to like it i just cant for some reason.
Looks good
good luck finding replacement panels in 10 years' time. :O
Makes me happy that the front end of my 2018 Mazda6 is reminiscent of Doug's opinion of the most beautiful luxury sedan on the planet.
Is this Jay Leno's son ?
Kinda looks like a charger
Aston Martin looked at Rolls Royce and the 1999 Dodge Charger concept and came up with this thing.
Doug the type of guy to recommend Cars&Bids to his dog
3:26
Thought this was some sorta polestar extended wheelbase model
Looks like a 2030 Taurus.
It really is breathtakingly beautiful. The geometry is magnificent
Why is matte black lol
I love how this man dresses himself
Doug is the type to buy water from the store and set it free in the ocean
aston martin really do nice cars the only issue I see is that its insanely overpriced
"And they only made 120 of these for the entire planet."  and 80% of them are sitting in garages in the Middle East never to be seen again.  Edit: I commented this before he even mentioned the "only sold for the Middle Eastern marker" comment. I wasn't surprised.
Aston's front ends look great. Dig their grill and headlights. The interiors are so fat love the leather. Do these cars last? They are so beautiful
This was back when Aston knew how to design cars. Now they're just... not as nice as they used to be.
Last time I was this early, Doug was a reasonably well dressed gentleman.
Looks alright
the anteater car got reborn, but it doesnt look like an anteater
This car needs Hoovie's daughter to repaint it.
Please Review the Kia Stinger GTS!!!
They just had to keep that darned steering wheel 🤦🏾‍♂️✋🏾
Doug 2030: will use it as a laptop stand for more doug demero channel ")
I'd be scared to drive this.  I'd be scared to sit inside of it.  I'd be scared to go near it.   I'd be scared being in the same room with it
Looks like a ford fusion with the lenght of an S class
It’s kinda ugly to me, I’ll wait on a maybach
Finally Doug got my fav. lux sedan ever♥️♥️♥️
i wake up early just for this
I can imagine Doug getting pulled over and saying to the cop "before I get arrested, be sure to check out Cars and Bids"
It really is a beautiful sedan. It's a damn boat, but it's gorgeous. And that paint! But I have to say, I see a lot of VW's Arteon in the styling. I wonder if they took some inspiration from the Aston....
Not worth the money...
The front reminds me of a Honda Accord
Imo looks like a ford Taurus concept
0/10 Dosen’t look like an Ant eater
Страшная
This just makes me wish Lamborghini had made the Estoque.
Front looks like a Ford Fusion
Oh god i read worlds as worst..   Luckily it is not.
Apparently 2018 is a different era than 2020
An upper-middle class house for 5 people  or as the Saudis would say: 1 broom broom with leather stitching
it'z juzt a rebodied rapide zelling for 5x the money.
Looks like a BMW i8 front with a japanese sedans back
The front end/ headlight assembly looks sort of like a Honda mixed with an Aston.
There was "specific market demand in the middle east" no, those were just the millionair sons of oil barons in dubai who where chumps enough to spend a million dollars on a passat before going broke and having to flee the country to scotland...
What about the Rolls Royce Sweptail? $13 Million USD.
genesis G90 for minimalist rich people
Love your videos
I think it's extremely awful and disproportioned, am i normal ?
Did Aston Martin make this because of the Doug review of the previous Lagonda
2021: Rolls Royce extravaganda  2.3 million dollar luxury sedan. I betThats gonna be a the come back from Rolls Royce.
Aaah the Centenario! Finally 😍
Super nice car! Headlights and grille remind me of an accord or charger though 😳
The front:headlights  looks like the Honda Accord google a picture
0:40 wait did he review this car or is it a sneak preview?
This should be an 1 hour video
Ugly af
Taraf in Arabic means luxury or richness
Seriously, he should review the Porsche 911 996 GT1 Srassenvesen. There is only 1 in north America and Doug should definitely review it.
Ford Fusion unlimited
Never liked an Aston Martin until now
0:38, now that's what i am talking about
That is double the Rolls Royce Phantom and the same price of  a Ferrari F40
Now waiting for the Centenario review
Im so hyped for that Centenario video :o
Thiiiis doesn’t look like an ant eater.
Doug send it to me ,don't dog it I will .
Waaaaaw :0
I don't know about the 1 million dollars price tag. But man is that a beautiful car! The front 3/4 is the best angle in my opinion for sure! 🤩
Million dollar car, $50 rattle can matte black paint
Yeah baby, 5,500th viewer and 663rd like! w00t w00t.
1 million car but 20 bucks on clothes, damn Doug😌
Ok,  now I'm shure, doug can find and review ANY car
Who else can't help but notice "Taraf" is an anagram of "a fart"?
It looks like it only cost around five hundred thousand dollars...
Good Looking car :D
1 million dollar car looking like the new Genesis
BMW i8
The front looks like the FORD Fusion.
Doug the type of guy to give his friends' girlfriends a Dougscore. ... The hot ones always get 69 somehow
Doug is the type of Guy Who Owns Land Rover that no body buys
We need that Lamborghini centenario review 😍😍😍
Man, that thing is beautiful.
WTF... some people just gave him dislikes without watching it all...
So Noone is gonna talk about that Lamborghini centanario that looks like a offbrand Bugatti chiron
It looks weird
This is definitely a Dubai oil car.
I'd still get a Phantom 8..it's still the most luxurious car in the world who with me?
This is almost as expensive as a VW golf in GTA 5
Consistent, drama free, and zero bias. Doug makes the best content on this platform
This thing is ridiculous. It's worth half as much as a phantom but it costs two times as much.
Doug is the type of guy to review an aston marting while looking like a Hyundai owner
what a stupid name xD
TTTHHIIIISSSSS
I wish it had suicide doors.
been waiting for this one!!
Doug is the type of guy to advertise cars&bids next to a Lamborghini Centernario.
Doug’s viewers are the type of people who appreciate Doug’s work by roasting him in the comments for likes.
Looks a lot Like catfish
Doug really is the only person that can pull off that look while reviewing a car like the Lagonda
In Romania Taraf was a TV channel with bad music :)
Hmmm
It's...nice.  LOL    Gorgeous car.
I’m convinced that Doug came out of the womb with 2 t-shirts on and nothing can convince me otherwise
Doug the type of guy to make the animal cracker sounds before eating them
This is a better design than the old lagonda
Doug is the kind of guy to review Hoovie's quirks and features and give him a doug score.
This looks more like a Massarati from the side.
Wow!
No one will pay 1 mil for THIIIIIS
Doug I really want you to come do a review on my rare 350 Z that I’ve put together on my YouTube channel
Absolutely beautiful vehicle
There is video between the ads But not much
That centenario tho 😍😍
Damn, this car looks so nice!
that thing looks like shit for the price tbh
Quarantine has done my boy doug real bad, man's getting Thiccer each day

Lets be real.. we expected an anteater
Doug the type of guy to say thank you after getting mugged
Ohhhhhh shitttt, Doug got a centenario to review
Most of the buyers are from middle east
Doug the type of guy to wear cargo shots in the winter and give it a dougscore
First car he shows while plugging cars and bids, will probably be the next review.
It was 50 seconds after posting this video by Doug and I saw 1 dislike Why?? You haven’t even seen the video😂 Please explain
looks like a gta 5 car
Never seen anything like it
Love Aston because like apple even tho they change the design of the car it’s still looks like Aston Martin they keep all the same looks with a new designs that’s hard to do
When he teased this video I first thought that is was some new Honda Accord
The Aston Martin Lagonda Taraf is ALSO the world's most BEAUTIFUL luxury sedan!!!!!!!!
Love the teaser for next videos
Curious George reviews cars?

Hi guys!!!!
I am so excited to see the lambo Int he intro
Doug is the kind of guy to own a Kia even though he drives the best cars in the world regularly
THISSSSSSS
Well, cool, but where are 90s SUVs that we all here for?
Real men use 3 pedals
Only 120 made for the entire planet? How many were made for other planets?
Better the Original One
Nice looking car

Gorgeous, stays true to the original
So review of Centenario is coming soon🤩

Sort of looks like a ford fusion
I didn’t even know this existed

Chicken dipped in milk is yummy

It's probably the most expensive due to the name "Taref" sounding like "Tariff"
lagonda is such an ugly name

Found out about this car a month ago and was very intrigued, thanks for the vid Doug!
Doug is the type of guy to recommend Cars&Bids to his children

nice
["This" intensifies]  Also: damn this beast is beautiful. Aston will never fail to make astonishing cars.
daddy doug
If you were to die today are you 100% sure that you can go to heaven? First, we have to realize that we all have sinned against God who is Holy, so He can’t let one sin in heaven, so He punishes sin with eternal hell. (Revelation 20:15  And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire / Romans 3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God). One sin is enough to make us  sinners as one crime is enough to make us  murderers, so we all have to realize that we are  sinners who deserve hell. The good news is that there is a solution to escape hell and that is Jesus Christ and what He did so we can go to heaven. (John 3:16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.) (1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures) (Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.) (Romans 3:24-26 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus..). So to get saved by Jesus Christ you have to believe from the heart ONLY on Jesus shed blood at the cross for the cleansing of sins, on His death for all your sins(past, present, future), burial and resurrection the third day, in Him as your personal saviour. You have to TRUST, that His sacrifice, His blood is sufficient to save you. A lot of people think that to get to heaven you have to not sin, do good works, get baptized, go to church, be catholic, etc but this is what God has to say about our works (Isaiah 64:6 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away). If the salvation is by our works then why did Jesus had to die on the cross? It is clear that salvation is only by trusting on Jesus Christ, on His sacrifice, His blood.
