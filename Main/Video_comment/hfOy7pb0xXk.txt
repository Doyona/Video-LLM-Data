You should have had forfeits for some task that required a business or organization to be open like the museum. Seems short sided.
so this is where snackzone was born
so pretty 5:04
Awwww the first ever snack zone!!!
Casper Recliner⏳
Kreekcraft is an L until he gives tim his strawberry elephant
25:51 can't believe that "The Snack Zone" was almost called "Ben and Adam Snacktacular"
this might be a top 3 episode for me. the inauguration  of the snack zone. the adrenaline adventure park. the song. the showcasing of NZ w challenges like never in the other eps. laughed so hard . cheers guys.
A landmark in internet history, the first instance of the Snack Zone. Having watched all the newer seasons and going back in time, this is an important moment.
7:22 Adam going crazy!
26:05 this moment marks the first ever snack zone on Jet Lag
Samuel you need to lock tf in
watching adam go insane from the Okihiau Express is oddly funny
So many iconic lines in this episode. Okaihau express and the best; Come here and let me feed you cream.
wait so snack zone didn't exist before season 5
Found Layover thanks to Downie Live. Nebula also thanks to Downie Live. New Sub here. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Tired, full of cream, back hurts. Hmmm... trying to keep a straight face here.
41:01-41:03 dont take this out of context. no one do this.
im confused why the harder challenges are worth less points .... the reward for going down the trickier route should be more points and the penalty for taking the easy route should be less points right?
26:00 SNACK ZONE DEBUT OMG I FINALLY FOUND IT
I feel like the point system is kind of unfair, Ben and Adam gets less points for challanges that take more time. How is admiring a tree for five minutes worth double the adventure zone?
So, here is where the snack zone was born, nice  to know it
26:04 and thus a legend was born. such an iconic episode- birth of the snack zone and the ōkaihau express
Wait so what is Bens card based sport mentioned in the first 20 questions?
Absolutely iconic episode with the Snack Zone and the Okaihau Express
Ben and Adam made this episode so funny lol
1:15 Welcome to the snack zone!
I have been doing a deep dive on Jet Lag over the last few months and I finally find the inception of The Snack Zone! Still waiting for a Snack Zone t-shirt...
I like how in this season (I am not looking them in chronological order, just how the YouTube algorithm presents them to me, so I have seen seasons that were released aftet this one), the challenges actually involve seeing stuff in the country! The other seasons (still entertaining, don't get me wrong) seem more focused on getting in and out of places fast, which seems a shame because they are certainly visiting some beautiful parts of the world! Anyways... Glad to see they are supporting the tourism and doing some of the many fun activities that NZ has to offer 😁
Favorite jet lag series
23:09 That's what she said 🥁🥁🥁
7:03 killed me
As a kiwi myself, I’m so glad that they respect Maori culture!
The cursing....
As I'm watching this for the second time, I forgot how hilarious the Okaihou express song was. Definitely my favourite season of Jet Lag! Youre amazing guys!
Toby is gorgeous
I like how you can still hear the f*cks in the echoes after the bleep
I hate to see nature so commercialised
19:17 "Come here and let me feed you cream."
Adam's cursing echoing through the tunnel during the Okaihau Express saga makes me smile every time
Sheeeeee starts out from otiria
26:01 The birth of SNACK ZONE!!!!
I've been watching Jet Lag seasons back since Season 12 and it feels cathartic to reach 26:03 and hear the first ever Snack Zone. Truly a moment in history.
me and my friends all still say bwuh in reference to ben on the first island
the minnow in fact did not want to make new friends with a predator
"come here and let me feed you cream, be careful of your little feet"  best out of context moment in all of jetlag
"[exasperated battle cry]". Another reason why Jet Lag subtitles are always awesome
Rewatching knowing the whole Ōkaihau saga is very funny
I think they should add meal break challenges, they look so tired!
22:15 Bird Alert! Bird Alert!
25:55 so happy to have found the original snack zone
Having watched the Schengen series just a while ago, the song memorization gives me strong Switzerland challenge ("reenact a scene from an earlier Jet Lag series") vibes.
the birth of the snack zone… wild that i’m coincidentally eating thinly cut chips while they eat thinly cut chips lol
I’ve been watching these all out of order. It made me SO happy to see the origin of The Snack Zone
Wow, the origin of what is called “The Snack Zone” Historians will look at this moments in hundreds of years time and be awed at the moment this happened.
rewatching this season and hearing ben say "we have arrived in okaihau" is knowing what is to come but theres nothing you can do about it
I'm rewatching this season after having completed my journey through the full cinematic universe and the inclusion of the specificity of the animal you needed to befriend at Lake Kai Iwi needing to be "non-human" cracked me up
this is family friendly until they have  to memorize a song
The birth of the snack zone ❤
this is the start of a legend. ‘THE SNACK ZONE BABBBBBBBBYYYYYYYY’
You know, the best part of the Okaihau Express challenge driving the boys up the wall is that they are the ones who came up with the challenges!
In the song drippings = "Pork dripping", also known as lard. Puppies in an apple box, are literally dogs being delivered probably to be farm dogs. Pippies are a type of edible mollusk. A guardsvan is similar to a caboose, but is used for braking.
29:18 Ben slipping had me DYINGGG 😭👏
Am I the only who is noticing the spider web at 1:37?
history was made on this episode
Nothing proved my nerdiness harder than knowing what bardcore was the second it was mentioned
I appreciate your show a lot. I live in San Diego and your show has made me go out and explore more of where I live.
SNACK ZONE BABY!!!
ive been watching the seasons out of order and i cant believe i just witnessed the first ever snack zone
0:57 I know that music. That’s ISP’s outro music
25:57 - birth of the legend.
After so many seasons it's nice to come back to the birthplace of the Snack Zone (and my favorite season of Jet Lag)
# team Ben and Adam
The worlds of Tibees and Jet Lag are two realm that I never thought would collide into one another.
I get a sunburn on my back every single year, even with sunscreen and low exposure, so I've been looking at getting a swimsuit with sleeves. I'd love to know where Toby got her swimsuit, it's cute
1:10 they predicted the snack zone!!  EDIT: OMGMG!! 26:01
SNACK ZONE!
Oh this is episode where the Snack Zone birthed to the universe the first time!
oh my god, its the birth of the snack zone!
It's 2025, I just clicked on this season because New Zealand is at the top of my travel bucket list. Didn't expect to see the origin of "The Snack Zone" 😮
8:18 (exasperated battle cry)
NEVER DIG HOLES at the beach!!!  Holes can be DEADLY! Holes should not be dug deeper than knee deep for the smallest person.  If you know there are children playing in the area then thw hole should be no deeper than  a toddlers knee height (6 inches).  I live in Florida and we have news stories of kids playing in sand holes and end up under a colapsed sand castle almost monthly. Its such a bizarre thing to have in your game and the risk isnt worth the short entertainment value to the episode.  Keep up the hard work!
1:28 debut snack zone
9:25 Toby bringing in the Luck! ✨✨✨
8:17 8:18
Toby is the best guest Star we need her back for many many many more seasons she needs to be part of the main cast
Imagine being a young New Zealander and not being able to pronounce Maori place names correctly. Shameful.
THE FIRST SNACK ZONE!!!!
Ah, I’ve heard legends of the song
25:58 The birth of the Snack Zone
@26:00 The historical birth of The Snack Zone!
25:55 and so, the greatest Segway in the history of ever into a show was created
Oh so this is the origin of the Snack Zone?!
25:55 what's how it started
Here it is. The birth of the Snack Zone.
12:20 top left corner 🕸️🕷️
I feel like Ben and Adam didn’t do the cream trip correctly . Whipped cream is not a DESSERT.😭
22:30 - Hometree, or the Tree of Life, in Avatar, was based on the Kapok Tree, which is a tropical rainforest tree from Central and South America, and Western Africa. They are the classic upper canopy trees seen in the Amazon.
Did I just witness the inception of the snack zone
19:16 caught me off guard. A bit unexpected from Adam
Crazy how all the Jet Lag seasons before this one didn't have the Snack Zone.
27:52 I love how they added the non-human part just cause of the stunt Sam pulled in Tag Eur It 1
This is it. I found the birth of snack zone !
I just love that the most watched scene is Ben and the first obstacle. Comedy gold.
The birth of the Snack Zone!
25:55 History was made in this moment.
Oh this is the birth of The Snack Zone :D
25:58  The birth of the greatest show within a show!
So this was the start of snack zone.
I did not expect that tree to have white bark. That's a stunning tree. We love trees!
"Come here and let me feed you cream"-Adam Chase
This was where the snack zone first began
6:33 7:03 7:19 7:30 8:18 8:51
Adam losing his shit is one of the funniest things I've seen on this show. Toby: "Hope you guy's are having fun wherever you are." Adam: "HUAAAHAAAUAAAAAGH!!"
26:04 the birth of the snack zone historical moment in jet lag
someone please put elphebas battle cry over the okaihou express part at 8 minutes 25 seconds
8:16 Best edit in the entire series!
Ben: "how many obstacles have we completed?" Adam: "One" Ben: "Shut up." This killed me. Especially follwed by Ben puking lake water.
These guys visiting Kawaii Island irl
THE VERY FIRST SNACK ZONEEEEEE
I started watching Jet Lag in the newer seasons before going back and starting from the beginning, and !!! it's SO exciting to witness the genesis of The Snack Zone 😂
I've already seen some of the later videos and it's nice to see the creation of The Snack Zone. I didn't realize it was this late into the series.
I feel like the coin rewards should also favor the riskier route, although im guessing you thought about balance a ton.
You forgot to censor 2 bad words
So this episode give birth to the Snack Zone
I am truly glad Sam did not go to the bay of islands, because I don't need another sucking off his shirt debacle.
"The sanctity of content" lmao 32:58
Am I the only one who always roots for Sam?
Toby: "I hope you guys are having fun wherever you are." Adam: *Ready to knock someone's lights out.*
29:10 waterpark replay button
I would love this format in my home state of Michigan. Start in copper harbor in the UP finish at the junction of Michigan/ Indiana/ Ohio borders. Even have a natural chokepoint at Mackinac
My one (so far) trip to the UK was during the 2001 hoof and mouth disease outbreak, so I'm familiar with those foot-sanitizing stations.
Hey, premiere of the Snack Zone!
26:05 birth of the snack zone
Please someone tell me what is the song ‘back on the road again’
i wonder how long it took them to memorize and sing the entire song aikahou express
The Snack Zone 🎉❤
Ben + Adrenaline Water Park = I haven't laughed that hard in a LONG time. My god. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
it's adorable how supportive Adam is of...to...(I don't know.... english is wonky as ESL) Ben.
ahhhh so this is the video where they invented the snack zone that appears in almost all other videos
8:52 (bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep bleep) (snorting laughs) was my favourite part
Thé snack zoneeeeeee
Invention of the Snack Zone
Adam encouraging Ben at the obstacle course was so sweet
I have got to teach Sam to play Name of a Fish.
I guessed it was Ben before she even asked a question!!
22:38 when Ben thought that was a penguin made me go like: ur in the bright sun, with no snow!
19:17 "come here and let me feed you cream"
Next time for challenges like the waterfall one where the waterfall was only a minute away, they should make the rule that they have to roll the die at the attraction instead of just at the car park.
8:17  toby: “i hope you guys are having fun wherever you are.” adam: “AAAaaaaAAAAAAAAaaaaaaAAAAAA”
powerful quote by adam " COME HERE AND LET ME FEED U CREAM"
I love that they had to specify not human animal since Sam pet Ben in a past season when they simply said living animal
8:18 Adum: AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
She starts out from oteria FU**
I didn't realise until they climbed that peak at 36:04 but damn Toby has super long hair. Like I used to know someone who had waist height hair which was crazy too but Toby's is like thigh height.
BRO WTF RASHENS MY GOAT
The start of the snack zone
Now stuck on Bardcore. Thank you, Toby! ❤
the birth of the snack zone
So Snack Zone was born at 25:59 of this video.
Wow. That tree is HUGE! I think  I will visit New Zealand just for that tree.
Wait, Snack Zone hasn't been created yet at this point?
Is toby a Boy 😊
Is Sam with Toby in a relationship
Great to look back on the origin of the now legendary "Snack Zone"!
Who else thinks Adam could be a stand up comedian?
I wonder how long they had this memorized or if it left their brain right after they got it
the birth of the snack zone
Toby just opened a whole new world for me with bardcore
10:40 imagine saying espresso
love the snack zone
tbh i ship toby an sam
Anywhere to see like how long the challenges and sections took? im really curious about the  ones like singing and kayaking with the editing it seems like it took forever. Hard to get a feel for how close they are or how hard the challenges really are unless they recap or something at the end.
she starts out from otiria
I lovvveeeee Toby’s jetlag themed nails !!!!
The sanckboyz really know the content I wanna see
Given how iconic it is now, it's hard to believe that the Snack Zone didn't exist until Season 5, Episode 2
The coin rewards seem really weird. Why is the adventure park 5 points and find a fish 20 ?
17:54 anyone knows this music?
Got re-recomended this and loved to see the start of "Snack Zone"!
I have to be honest, I am so sick and tired of the cast mispronouncing every word in a foreign language without a care. You could just spend 10 minutes learning the sounds. It's so easy. There are websites for this. But no, they refuse to. It's infuriating.
OK but can we just mention how American their pronunciation of "Hundertwasser" was?
"Very tired, full of cream and back hurts." Must have been a hard Night.
Poor ben in the waterpark😂
Watching all these seasons again and it's the snack zone baby.
Ben trying to complete the obstacle course made me laugh so hard😂😂
7:15 'But no one knows the difference when they're drippin' from the SACK.'
God I need that uncut okaihau express footage so bad
36:34 ill have to disagree with you,math is thr best subject
I know that I’m a year late but I really want an uncensored version of Ben and Adam trying to memorize the song
the moment i saw memorize the song and sing it without a single error i was thinking 'veto it immediatly' after seeing how long that song was.. why didn't they just veto it
"come here and let me feed you cream"😂
13:07 roblox 😂
Fall count of ben and adam (mostly ben) 29:16  29:19  29:44  29:49  30:20  30:32  30:56  31:22  33:22  33:28 (wouldnt call that a fall but its entertaining)
LMAO BEN AND ADAM MESSING UP THE SONG JUST LIKE SAM AND TOBY LUCK DIGGING ON THE BEACH HAHAH
isn't new zealand an island?
Hey! Rashuns are amazing
i can't believe i'm really watching the first Snack Zone!
How many of us noticed that nasty spiderweb on the backside of the rear-view mirror? I certainly did. YIKES. That's uh... oh god haha That tree looks a white Baobab tree. That's genuinely epic!
The rainbow falls over should have been a 4:2 not 3:3
How did you make the digital map of New Zealand?
Ben obstacle course is frustrating. He's like a sausage
Toby : (as a science tutor) every body has a centre of mass  Meanwhile Ben : Ain't no way I keep falling
Im a road trip junkie and "on the road again" by willie nelson is a requirement for all of my trips at least once. Thank you sam for unintentionally following my tradition 🙏
Now seeing the Ben/Adam route, smart but tricky choice. Seeing this song task.
Full of cream💀
i live in nz i have been to all those places
The Snack Zone segments are so good!
23:58 They came up with SNACK ZONE!
"...how many have we completed?" "One." ".........shut up."
It surprises me how unathletic you can be it wasnt that hard to get through that adventure park
really felt ben on the obstacle course there. i moved house recently and was panting just going up the damn stairs
imagine they had've called the segment 'Snack Boyz'
That song task must have sucked but holy fuck it's funny
The legacy of The Snack Zone thus begins!!
26:07 aand the legend of snack zone was born
21:30 Biosecurity is rad 🤙
At 10:05 is the Okaihau express at its final run
"Very tired, full of cream, and my back hurts"  -Ben, 2023.
I would watch Ben at an adventure park like that all day 😂😂😂 I was dying that whole segment
I’m from nz!!!
Love the Snack Zone!!
I absolutely love Ben but I can't help but laugh at how uncoordinated he is and I would be so frustrated :') he toughs it out every time though and I have to give him credit for not giving up
Ben and Adam: This should take like 20 minutes max. Also Ben and Adam: *take much, much longer*
Kiwi🇦🇺🙂🐧
Whish tracking app do you use in these games
Kayak for an hour = 15 coins Snorkle for 10 mins = 20 coins I see some balance issues :D
toby: "hope you guys are having fun :)" adam: AHHHHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHH
Sam: I've always gone the high risk route, which gives Ben and Adam the advantage. Also Sam: Let's take the risky luck route!
Biosecurity is rad!
Origin of the snack zone!
Okaihau Express starts at 1:55
The snack boyz have a good logo but they don't taste good snacks
those cleaning gates everywhere are good
great trip :D
Am I the only one that saw how Ben and Adam are dressed and suddenly think of Mario and Luigi?
I just realised Toby us the one who made that video about the different dimensions and the whole 2d thing
Name something you can say on Jet Lag: The Game and in the bedroom  "I'm very tired, very full of cream and my back hurts"
Adrenalin park: Me: I bet that must be a ton of fun for both of them Ben: I hate it here.
Is she really playing thr game with crocks on?💀
you drove past my mates family farm!
wonder how someone could veto a public toilet lol??
5 coins for the water park and the museum, seems off
Ben might be the least coordinated human on the planet
Sam should’ve vetoed the second he rolled a six lmao
Everybody should treat each other as if they were together on Tokatoka Peak
Anybody else notice the cobwebs behind the mirror in Ben and Adam’s car? 🕸️
“Come here and let me feed you cream.”-Adam
Ben and Adam: 7:00 8:15 8:50 26:00 start of snack zone
They should have called it the Snacktest Break with BenAdam
I call staged. Never saw anybody tailgating closely, overtaking dangerously, stealing their car, or getting pulled over to be given a speeding ticket even though they weren't speeding. No way this video really happened in New Zealand!
I always though Adam was pretty chill for living in New York. I am delighted that this singing challenge exposed the truth.   Perfect, hilarious, perfect.
This is just freaking comedy gold. I like the mix of personalities and I'm all here for Toby's favorite music genre being bardcore!
Ben & Adam memorizing the song had me in stitches 🤣
Sam: "We aren't climbing *that* thing right? [cuts] Sam: "Ok so we're climbing that thing"
Tokatoka is 100% a good relation test from what I see :P
You guys should design a challenge-based Cannonball Run! Take the speed element out of it like you did with this one. After all, this is basically a NZ Cannonball Sea to Sea Classic!
Hope you guys are having fun! _Scene switches to Ben and Adam_ AAAAARGH!  That is just diabolical editing, I love it!
As a theatre kid, I sympathize a lot with Ben and Adam’s struggling.
Watching Ben failing in the waterpark is genuinely one of the funiest things I´ve ever seen! :D
The okaihau brach,sometimes known as the kaikohe branch and rarely known as the rangiahua branch was a branch line railway that joined the north auckland line of the national rail network of new zealand at otiria. It was the most northernly line of new zealand and was intended to run all the way to kaitaia. It opened to okaihau in 1923 and closed in 1987:
i hate how pessimistic sam gets
It hurts my soul that they did not go see that waterfall 😢 I mean how many people will never have the chance of seeing such beautiful things? Adam and Ben repeatedly failing at that song made up for it, though 😂
Mostly play this series as I do puzzles, glance over if I wanna see what’s going on. Kept trying to tune in to admire the tree alongside the contestants but the cut would happen before I did ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
just binging every single episode...
I love that y'all have mandatory food breaks !
That’s a tadpole
waiting in the car instead of the beautiful beach is v on brand for them
When is the next season of games coming up
Very nice games
Wish it would show how long the challenges took
This is by the funniest episode I’ve seen from Jet Lag from Ben and Adam I laughed so much it hurt my stomach, trying to mesmerise the song and messing up swearing, Adam doing all the paddling. Ben slipping and falling on the obstacles, love the challenges, videos and experiences you guys do/see.
That bay of islands challenge is fucking wild because one of my top 10 worst sensory moments was when I was camping in paihia and was playing pie-face with a bunch of other kids and (I already hated canned whipped cream at that point) when I got it all over my face and could smell that fake dairy literally marinating on my skin I was gonna fucking throw up and there was no running water so I had to run down to the beach (it's pitch black) and waterboard myself in the sea to get it off. The complete darkness+smell and taste of sweet dairy+the saltiness of the sea was fucking disgusting. So I know how you feel .
LOVE SAM AND TOBY ❤❤❤❤Toby Plss Come back in another seson
Cool variable oystercatcher seen by Ben and Adam
Wait… is this the real life lore guy?
Really wish there was some kind of time or distance scale for the routes. Them getting the scratch ticket shortcut vs going the long way has no meaning to me. Same for the East/West route choice.
Eyo where is that medieval cover playlist?
could he not have just looked through the window
Oof I'm watching this for the first time and it's days after Lizzo's been cancelled into oblivion
Ngl I wanna play this I'm from nz is there like info on like the rules and challenges and cards etc?
Bros subscribe to this channel they're a true legend 👏 this whole concept of a reality show type game on YouTube is really so much exciting and unique ❤
Bros subscribe to this channel they're a true legend 👏 this whole concept of a reality show type game on YouTube is really so much exciting and unique ❤
i love how they had to throw in "non-human animal"
How is it possible that every one of the four contestants - even Toby (who should know better because she wasn't raised in a country where you can buy cheese in a spray can) pronounce route as though there is no 'e' at the end of the word  ("raowt")??? It's driving me crazy! Come on people, it's route! Rhymes with boot! If you take the e away then you can say raouwt all you want. Hrumph!
At 31:30 Ben was drunk even though he wasn't. 😂
Ben and Adam doing the song is a replay of Brian and Sam playing mini golf
You can see clocks through the door!!
She was going!!! 😂
Ice *cream*
oh no now i have to bingewatch toby's channel too😭the binge never ends
This season is really great, and I would really like to play something like that myself! It seems so fun!
It's amazing you have to clean your shoes to enter the nature.
this cool cause i am from new zealand
You should come to NZ’s neighbour, Australia
I’m loving Ben’s overalls
19:15 ''come here and let me feed you with cream'' xd
Ben: "Im full of cream and my back hurts"
By far the funniest part of this video was the Kiwi bloke absolutely girt by kayaks claiming that he didn't have any kayaks. I am very proud of my Southern Hemisphere brethren.
23:10 That’s what she said 😏         I’m going to hell lol
Swallowing is a voluntary action, but it’s also an involuntary action. We do it without thinking about it so many times throughout the day.
Adams angry singing made me laugh 😂
Hunter Watson? They mean Hunderwasser, the Austrian architect who most likely designed the building were the toilets are. Min. 27:10 https://youtu.be/hfOy7pb0xXk?t=1634.  Go team America I guess :/
This song killed me😂😂😂
my gf walked at 19:17 ...I had a lot of explaining to do
The tree is gorgeous. Also I had wondered why ben and adam chose such a small car.. but convertible makes sense.
but can we take a moment to discuss the cob web on the back of Ben/Adam's rear view mirror?
Team Ben and Adam 4ever 😤
I'm sorry but Ben and Adam got the worst snacks 😭💀
When Adam just says a lot cusses it made me lmao 😂
23:10 me after my Grindr date
Guys I swear Toby does not found like a New Zealander bro
Okaihau Express is my new favorite song
Come here and let me feed you cream😂
Adam's cursing spree at the tunnel got me CACKLING! Also Ben's fit was 100/10
Cleary, Ben was alreaddy drunk when they got to the obstacle course lol
I am the Ben in these videos
Instead of rushuns, try twisters or burger rings. They are way better than rashuns.
5:32 I love how the "ok" in Okaihou is marked yellow when Ben says "ok what the ****"
It's weird. Some easy challenged give 15 coins and adrenalin park gives only 5?? That seems weird. And the west coast challenges were sooo much easier and quicker, that's crazy.  On another note, Toby is great ! Probably the best team partner Sam has had IMO. She has her opinions on strategy whereas the other partners Sam had let him decide of everything pretty much.
sam needs to fix his gambling problem
I'm from England and watching these videos has inspired me to go NZ, you make it look so beautiful. Keep up the good work!
Best channel yt recommended me in months. I've been watching whole weekend all seasons. Great job guys, and girls. Go team ADAM AND BEN!!!
The game is really very interesting 👍. Thanks for updating this . That's give me so much happyness. Please, Continue the series.  Thanks, https://youtube.com/@jetlagthegame
Does anyone else secretly want a channel where Ben and Adam just review snacks for an hour
Kind of worrying sam can't give toby a real compliment lol. Every season he shows how selfish he is. He would do his channel wonders if he stood aside and let another person step in for him
Just a joy to watch, her face is in a constant state of "can't believe I'm doing this, this is awesome".
I died at "I'm very tired, full of cream, and my back hurts." Though, it wasn't as funny as the obscenity fest that was the song memorization.
why not the Snack Shack?
The tunnel BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP
22:12 legit reminded me of drunk ben keep saying " *bird* " in boston 🤣
Love Adam and Ben....I challenge Sam(The Obnoxious Youtuber) to a race..Hitchhike from Perth to Sydney in Australia, or all of highway1...a full lap of Australia.
Collectively, you guys have all the personality of a wet cabbage, but this is an awesome idea, and the content is entertaining enough. Fair play
This show is incredibly funny, wholesome, entertaining, all of it. But this season is especially wholesome and I can't stop smiling.
Oh yeah Ben and Adam. My Boyz!
Bro Toby is so hot. Her accent  🥰🥰🥰
Ben: *falls into the water*  Adam: "Oh, Ben" Ben: *Proceeds to go headfirst into the water after completing every obstacle*
Ben and Adams are such a good pair!
Great episode! Love Sam🤍❤!
Trust me rainbow falls is boring in person, so you didn't miss much 😂
the snack zone potato chip review enriched my life
27:55 I love how they made sure to specify NON-HUMAN animal in this challenge. 😂
Shout out to Patrick Willems. Didn’t know about y’all until he shouted you out on his channel.
Toby is a A+. Ben and adam play off each other well in a team
AVATAR TREE!
Sam was too focused on the content and it was sad to see Toby him and toby in a Rush. It's about the journey!
So weird to see two separate youtubers you follow collab suddenly out of nowhere.. Amazing video!
19:30 am I the only one who thought cream like lotion
Cowtent!
which month did you go to new zealand?
25:20 Admittedly, that pronunciation kind of kills me. Props to trying tho :)
we just went to the adrenaline adventure park so fun!!
The samtoby shippers will be coming soon...
😁
Why Ben and Adam didn't just ate cream on the road since it was part of the North island of New Zealand itself
I want Ben and Adam’s cover of the Okaihau Express on Spotify
23:33
My niece has similar nails and shoes. She is 12.
Toby finally being in the thumbnails are the smallest details that makes me fall in love more with this show
Nice how in the last episode Sam and Toby were stressing out and now it's Ben and Adam's turn to get slowed down. It's like "Mom said it's my turn with the bad luck"
22:52 when adam says that, since he and ben are the editors, he's talking to himself
Toby, thank you for introducing me to Bardcord
3:43 you're welcome.   I'm sorry.
26:00 Snack Zone Ep1: Bluebird Thinly Cut Potato Chips Thanks for kicking it in!
snack boys sounds like a rip off of munch squad
I love how bad Ben is at the adventure park!!!
Driving... NO ITS THIS 🤣
I need more SnackZone in my life
Dripping from the sack
Is it just me or can anyone else not stop looking at the cream on bens top?
The rules should be amended to say that you cant roll the dice untill you are at the challenge - the car park does not count.
that tree must be based on avatar 100%
I appreciate your highlighting kauri die back prevention.
22:57 They almost did the Smash Bros. Mario victory theme.
I like how the challenge complete sound plays the Zelda item find but just stops right before the good part.
Dripping from the sack? TO THE WINDOOOOOOOOW TO THE WALL
15:45 I really don't think the jet ski guy was saying you _need_ to go on the tour
7:43
The editor deserves a raise He had to bleep out so many swear words
i love watching ben and Adam trying to memorise a song then failing on the first line 😆😆🤣🤣
I live for the snack zone!
23:10 Say that again, but slowly
♪ on the road again~ goin’ places that I’ve never been before 🎶
Just ask the jetski guy if they'll take ya across goddamnit!
love the girl power. But man, Ben and Adam are so hilarious. I fell from my chair when the scream came
I can’t imagine I have laughed harder in my life than at 29:15 whahaha
8:52 bens laugh was so cute at that lmao
Ep 2-Seeing how many times Adam And Ben swear at the tunnel
Just chilling watching Sam and Toby on their vacation/date.
I wish you guys would’ve practiced the pronunciation of Maroi words better (like the main thing is the vowel pronunciation)
“Come here and let me feed you cream” 💀  Adam-NZ
i like the part where the lads got creamed
35:42 "I see the light too" this made me CACKLE Hope my housemate did not mind
Who else is searching up mnm bard core
Snack Boiz lmao
Ben and Adam lookin like a snack in The Snack Zone™. I'm tired of waiting for the next nebula episode so I'm rewatching on YouTube
31:01 will definitely going to end up in a future Jet Lag Out of Context video...
Ben and Adam doing their best to sing the song has made me laugh harder than I have in a long while. Love this series!

Super Mario? Who has the best hair, Sam or Toby?
Toby saying medieval bardcore is her favorite music genre???? She truly is a legend, an icon, the moment etc etc
I want a playlist with the best medieval bardcore you listened to
amazing
Bardcore is amazing xD I just looked it up the first time because of this video. The creators, the comments, the music - they are all hilarious xD I started with Eminem bardcore, but a huge number of sons exist.
Bro those icons keep lookin like OSU achievements and keep getting me GAHHH
Is that dirty I hope not 😂
ben i am tired back hurts full of cream ?
Just imagine going on a trip of a life time to new Zealand, only to find a couple of people screaming between bouts of singing in a tunnel 😂
23:10 couldn't be more sus
bro rashuns are goated how could you say that 😢
I'm having a love affair with those shorts.  Where does sam shop?
12:22 that might be because there isn’t a lot of pollution but I’m just a dolphin so I don’t know
Rooting for team Sam/Toby!
When the sky is so blue it looks like its becoming dark, then it is REAL blue.
Ben and Adam in the tunnel is the single most entertaining thing I've seen in the series so far
DOES TOBY HAVE JET LAG NAILS?!
Sam trying to remember a Willie Nelsen song while Ben and Adam slowly lose their minds singing the Okaihau express has such a vibe
I'm constantly amazed at how well produced this series is. It genuinely has better editing and pacing than most movies I've seen.
toby has been such a great jetlag guest!!! she’s like a perfect mix of being competitive while also chill
Toby's notebook of the scratchcard odds, that's preparation! This is gearing up to be yet another awesome season! The energy and vibe of each team is awesome. I'm glad you took different routes at the start, I want to see all the games!
This is the best thing we've seen on YouTube in a long while. The editing is just beautiful!
Sam and Toby climbing my maunga 🤍 my heart is full.
I hope the podcast doesn’t remain exclusive to Nebula forever. It doesn’t make sense when there’s an audience who watch Jet Lag on YouTube.
im rooting for ya ben and adam
I do feel like if an attraction is closed, the Veto time should be halved, especially if it's not the players fault, like it's always closed on that day, or it would have been impossible for them to reach it in time due to the start time.
I'd like to have a better understanding of the timeframe of these challenges. Like a little edit that mentioned how much time did they spend on the challenges? Some look really short due to the (great!) edits, but I reckon in reality some might have taken a little while...
I wanna watch the entire segment of Adam and Ben trying to memorize the lyrics
Why even bother scratching the cards if you're in a race? After you bought them just ask the guy to scan them to see if one of them are winning ones
#TeamBenandAdam
Distinkt Dora the Explorer vibes in this season
17:48 I'm 100% sure it was you, not Ben
going through whangarei was a bad choice lads this place is always a let down 😂
Adam is clearly a lot more athletic than Ben 😂
"I love watching Ben and Adam cream into each others mouths"
Toby Hendy is pretty cool! It’s nice to have her on as a guest on the show
“Come here and let me feed you cream” (Adam 2023)
I really whish I could subscribe to nebula but I don't have a credit card :(
The height differences in the last shot are wild
11:04 the question still ist, how long did it take?
I dont get it, why is admire a tree worth 10 points for 5 mins and do this waterpark thingy only 5 points. Besides that, still a great show
Driving through summer NZ in a Z3 must be a dream
Hunter Watson Hundertwasser xD
Ben and Adam swearing is honestly peak comedy
No one: Adam: "Come here and let me feed you cream"
I know Sam means Socially Awkward Man, but come on, give better compliments!😄
I wished Sam would chill a little bit, actually take a few seconds to enjoy where they are.
listening to the boys repeatedly pronounce Māori place names wrong physically hurt me
As much as I don't want this to be staged. The express part is absolutely fake. You can literally see them do the same hand movements voice and breathing on the same parts on each of the "attempts" (They just recorded different parts failed and correct then put them together)
Closed captioning made Toby saying "Comin' up Millhouse" to be "coming up buildhouse" lol
I grew up in Whangarei and know every spot in this video very well. It's so awesome to see my region on such a high profile YouTube channel, and for them to still do it justice is awesome! Thanks guys 👍👍
whats toby s Instagram😮🤔
Brilliant i'm in Rotorua - Its not funny hearing them say the place names
Adams gonna be feeling that sun burn in the morning i can already tell
pls return tag
That was the best episode yet, I had so much fun. Thank you guys, wednesdays are now the best days.
Some of those places looked stunning. For places like New Zealand it would be really cool if you found a way to show off some of the landscapes in the video. I'm aware that this type of video may be too fast-paced, but even just little snippets of drone footage here and there would be great!
As someone who's lactose intolerant, I applaud Ben and Adam for completing that challenge. Wow. I would've od'd on lactase pills
That tunnel song thing was really annoying to watch. Had to skip that part
does jet lag only go to places when it is summer there
I just had a thought that now that they've got enough seasons, they could do a season that's all returning guests:  Toby & Joseph vs. Brian & John Green.  Ben & Adam show up at random points in the game to help or hinder the players depending on how challenges & powerups go.
This was probably my favorite episode across the whole show. It has the perfect balance of frustration and satisfying achievements, plus just really fun overall MUCH LOVE
Not me coming on here after watching it on nebula last week to read everyone’s comments
there must be a video where is that full song singed by our guys :)
When Nebula only accepts creditcard😭😭
Just so yall know, the "au" in Māori words is pronounced like the letter O (or like the word "owe"). So Kauri is pronounced "Koh-ree", not "Cow-ree"
Ben's incompetence is both enraging and endearing.
Surely they’ll see at least one clock through the windows of the clock museum?
I didn’t realise it was possible to not like rashuns. They’re usually one of those ‘can’t go wrong’ party snacks 1:30
My brother makes those aflex water parks up in Nelson, quality built stuff there
The snack zone. Can't get enough of that sax.
I appreciate Adams redwood shirt, because I live in the redwoods and they are absolutely beautiful especially the ones on the coast.
Don't tell me you guys didn't film this during the recent cyclone/bad weather we recently had here... So many roads were closed 😂
I may have to unlike as you didn't enjoy rashuns. they are my childhood bro. /jk
It took until she said Adam’s full name for me to realize I went to undergrad with him, I just figured it was a similar-looking Adam oops
Thank you for the life changing discovery of Bardcord, Toby!
Adam and Ben messing up and swearing at each other is probably the funniest thing so far
You guys should do a race across Japan against @Abroadinjapan and @CDAWGVA
Me and ben in the snorting gang😂
I'm a big fan of 'The Snack Zone'!
This season appears to require the most physical endurance. The other seasons have mostly been focused on public transit and planes, so having so many physical challenges and driving is probably a bigger challenge then they were expecting. This is so sweet, though, that I hope they do another country board game like this
I’m sorry Sam and Toby you are so cool, but Ben and Adam are by far my favorite team, their vibes are simply too good for this world <3
25:57 snack attack
Ben and Adam got such a cool car I’m jealous
This is the only channel I have notifications on for. You guys produce high quality content 👍
No rush. You will probably use the same ferry...
Sam's found a loophole in his bad luck by getting Toby to roll the dice instead of him
27:50 We know exactly where the non-human rule came from. XD
Only true fans know why the challenge said "non human animal"
Ben was exactly how I would do the lake race
Why is Sam so awkward lol
39:05 welp someone’s in a pickle
Surely one of the funnest episodes yet!
tobys hair is so long
I thought whipped cream was always great
i need those cute dungarees ben has ngl
7:16 LMFAO
I think rolling the dice in the car park was cheating a little. I’d think it meant rolling the dice in front of the falls and not 50 seconds away.
I died at "come here and let me feed you cream"
I feel like the swimming challenge would have been more balanced if it was roll a d6 and that is the number of laps you need to take, otherwise it's just a coin flip. It can't be that hard to swim 2 or 3 laps of 100 meters or so, right? ...of course, I did swim team in high school, so I might be a bit biased there. A 300 of front crawl is your everyday warm up regimen for a workout class. Of course swimming pools aren't flowing water, but from that photo it didn't look like the water was moving very much where they'd be swimming. :3
29:16 i spat out my food laughing watching Ben fail *MISERABLY* 😭😭
I’d love to see you guys doing something similar but with electric cars so you also have the added challenge of having to stop what they charge and having to factor that into your strategy!
I've never seen Ben so PG in any season as much as singing a song!
"coming up buildouts" = coming up Millhouse 34:17
We need more video of this
I like how Toby holds a pen like it's a microphone.
ROBLOX?!? 37:53
33:44 im not sure Ben will survive this game...
23:10 "I'm very tired, very full of... *cream* and my *back hurts* " - ben  'Snack Boyz' be hitting different now
Ben and Adam: KNOW they have to eat cream on each island Also Ben and Adam: DONT opt for a liquid cream they could each take a sip of each island
19:25 [Miles of nice sandy beach] Ben and Adam: Lets land at the only rocky part
16:20 OMG just put on the Mistborn Final Empire read by Michael Cramer and be done with it.  IF anyone asks, say you were sponsored by Audible
7:37 I would say about about 2 12 inch beach holes or so
3:45 anyone else think Ben and Adam may have given sam a loaded die?
1:00 yes sam, we too are disappointed that you are always in trying to catch up
The best part is listening to them mess up of Maori words 😂
Ben and Adam give me serious Mario and Luigi vibes
Love seeing you in Aotearoa but I would encourage you guys to learn how to pronounce the te reo Māori words, especially Toby, I understand she probably hasn't lived here for a while but for a 'new zealander' you should definitely be able to pronounce at least kauri right. Just so you know, 'au' is pronounced like how you would the say the letter 'o' and r is usually a very short sound, similar to the way white people say 'd' so kauri sounds more like co-dy sorta, and Māori like mouldy but the d is a very short sound.
Kiwi here. No one likes Rashuns.
Let’s all acknowledge that Snack Zone could be a great set of shorts.
I do love these videos, but the pronunciation is soooo hard to listen to 😅
This is my favorite high production yt show since video game high school.
My favorite roadtrip snack game is snack Russian roullete: stick you hand on the snack bag and you have to eat whatever you pull out.
31:57 WOW Toby could see _WVERYTHING!_
Adam if you see this, please let Ben talk
If anyone was wondering what the "tracker app" is, it is called Life360 and the icon looks like a white fingerprint with a purple background.
Adams “fuck” count? Anyone?
convenient that the kayak song adam sang is to the tune of a new zealand folk song!
wish they would have added a zero to all of the coin totals. Would not have changed the game, but the graphics would have looked better. Otherwise, great stuff!
you guys really needed head mounts or chest mounts for the go pros
math is my favorite subject and strongest ela what my mom teaches is nt
are they still going or have they finished recording everything
9:18 What's the point of the challenge if there's a 50% chance not even seeing Rainbow Falls?
Loved seeing Ben and Adam cream each other
We NEED the uncut unedited version of Ben and Adam singing in the tunnel. 😅
Ben and Adam are just the best people to watch😂
Oh my God Toby. I never knew that Medieval 🏰 Eminem Existed O.O That’s soo funny
This channel is so much better than most TV shows! Great stuff!
lol @ the cobwebs behind the rearview mirror
A show within a show??? Munch squad???
Ben and Adam having a conversation about how hard paddling is while Ben isn't actually paddling is hilarious.
41:33 ah yes, the all mooshy dhishcwohd
ben triggers my nurturing instinct. and adam's, clearly.
Did I miss the part where Ben had to do a drinking challenge before the adrenaline park? He looked drunk the whole time 😅
Ben's rowing technique of just sitting there and agreeing how difficult it is while never rowing always cracks me up.
Is this still the first day?
Need a poster of Ben's face after tasting that snack🤣🤣 🤣 hilarious!
Can't believe this Kiwi girl Toby is misleading them on the pronunciation of names so badly...
Are Ben and Adam gay and together?
is it just me or is she into Adam??
I'm kinda rusty, but I'm pretty sure Adam was holding that paddle backwards for most of the kayaking
Now I have the Okaihau express in my head 🤣🤣
literally my fav youtube channel
37:47
1:35 The Spiderwebs at the mirror... What a car rental service...
Was that a spider web on your rear view mirror??? Hahaha! New Zealand is not joking when it comes to spiders! 🕸🕸🕸🕷🕷🕷
You've improved the format over time. Next step is to add judges. It's frustrating to have Ben and Adam adjudicate their own song and stop themselves, only to find out they were right. Especially because the players have a different version of honor systems (although Sam has been better about that this season).
32:54 Sam: we don’t want people to think we’re obnoxious YouTubers. Also Sam: You gotta understand the sanctity of content!
That girl is awesome, liked her a lot. Hope she will appear in other seasons
I love this show but the vocal fry is way to freakin' annoying!
They are in New Zealand. If they don't have challenges based around the LOTR locations, I'm going to be so upset and disappointed 😂
Pro move, skip the jafa episode
i was there 2days ago
There better be a challenge that has something to do with the lord of the rings.
adam: can we go in we'll be like 15 mins or so 4 hours later ben: how many have we done? adam: 4
if you are going to go to new Zealand please PLEASE learn to pronounce māori words correctly its so irritating because I am māori and the way you guys pronounced tokatoka was very very wrong my last name is toka so its a bit infuriating when people come to new Zealand and completely mess up pronunciations of māori words especially tāne mahuta.
"You're so good at spotting cool birds! Seriously!" *2 minutes later* "IS THAT A PENGUIN!?"
35:43  Sam: "Nearly there!" Toby: "Where am I?"  Can't stop laughing 😂😂
Love Toby she is so good at this <3
i swear you could just veto everything and be faster
Toby is by far my favoyrite guest. And her energy fits and balances with sam's energy quite well.
Ben and Adam's challenge: physically exerting themselves to paddle vast distances between islands and eat whipped cream on each one Sam and Toby's challenge: WATCH TREE
Wednesdays are made so much better with Jet Lag!
How fun that Toby has her fingernails painted with the Jet Lag logo.
I never really understood the idea of shipping characters until I started watching Jet Lag. In my head cannon, Ben and Adam have clearly been married for fifteen years.
Funniest Jet Lag episode yet
As a big fan of a medival rock band I fully support bardcore as a genre. :D  Also as always this was super fun. The memorizing the song bit was great.  Oh, and the fact that there was actually a graphic made for 'The Snack Zone.' Thank you, that's amazing.  I might go crazy over the pronounciation of Hundertwasser. I would never have figured out that's what they were trying to say!  The shenanigans have been so strong in this series that 'non-human animal' has been specified this time and damn I love that so much. xD Just, do whatever you can to loophole-proof these challenges.
Ugh, I thought when he was saying roadblocks he was saying robux and I wanted to vomit
Go Sam and Toby! Sam needs this win! Even if he is a complete and utter ad slut
non-human animal...lol
watched it on nebula, therefore no watchtime here ;)
Bullshit that they did that kayak trip in less than 5 minutes lol
Kiwi Nancy Wheeler is lucky on the dice AND the scratchies. Exactly who Sam needs to cancel out his luck.
How are you going to explain, buying lottery tickets as a business expense to the IRS.😅
I got Nebula! You guys make great content :)
The first time I visited Tane Mahuta, for what was supposed to be quick stop on the way home, I ended up sitting there for an entire hour just in awe. It's a truly surreal and magical experience photos/videos just can't convey
The Snack Zone is my new favourite thing. I will always root for Ben and Adam!!!
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate how good these Jet Lag series' are? I rewatched the tag across Europe in full over the weekend because it was that good. For this episode, it was excellent. The song challenge had me in stitches! Here's hoping that there are many more series after this one!  Wishing you the best of luck with the channel
just here to say that I'm a big fan of Toby :) I don't always like the vibe that others bring on the show, but she has good energy
My guess for the start of next episode, they look at one of the clocks visible from the closed door, and one of them will have the time they need.
🎶this🎶
I enjoy the idea but can't say I am happy with execution. In the first episode you went through a couple of distinct locations that I could be interested in. The the team who was Vetoed was just vetoed. No explanation of what they did for an hour, did they explore the town or just sit in their car?.  This episode, you do the same thing. But you decided Macca's was the place to get food. The country is still struggling from the impact of Covid. Why not go to a local Cafe?  I know this is pre-recorded but I hope to see better interactions that sell the local economy
FUCKKKKK I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO HEAR THE LAYOVER but I really can’t afford nebula. More rather I can’t if I can pay for it cuz my parents wouldn’t like me doing it 😭😭
Ben's stability control is off.
unrelated, but Team Sam & Toby is just team lucious hair this season 😄
I feel the coin ratio is a bit off this season. 10 coins for spending 5 minutes looking at a tree but only 5 points for the adventure park. Even the 15 for the cream trip seems a little low
Man, as a kiwi, I've been to so many of these places. And they've changed. The biggest tree for example, when I was younger, we went to. And you used to be able to walk right up to it and touch it and walk around it. And then Kai Iwi lakes... How they've massacred it. It used to have a very thick heavy forest all around the lake with a beautiful little camp sight nestled in the forest. Amazingly shallow lake until it drops off into the abyss. Used to go every single summer about a decade and a half ago with my family. Until the deforested the entire area and it just wasn't the same. Plus, the water seems to have MASSIVELY dried up. The flat beach used to all be water. So it was this beautiful flat and shallow lake and then a central super deep drop.
ben at the obstacle course was absolutely hilarious
It’s so unfair how Adam and Ben only got 5 points for doing 10 obstacles at a adrenaline park and  the other team got 20 for finding a fish:))))))
13:33 the tree just casually walking away 😶🤫
TOBY IS SOOO BEAUTIFUL
The amount of se.xual innuendo in this episode is something else lol 😂
I love these series! So much effort went into it. The subtitles are also really really great for a non-native English speaker like me.
They were on the clock but time was not on their side.
Rashuns are wonderful. I will die on this hill, from a cheesy bacon attack.
Wow
Nothing like creaming in your friend's mouth on a beautiful summer day.
watching ben repeatedly struggle on the inflatable water obstacles is SENDING meee  is his centre of gravity okay??
I love Ben and Adam so much. 'The Snack Zone' 😂
If sam and Adam were on a team they would absolutely destroy
32:02 But both of you didn't have to do them.
The SnackZone needs to become a regular segment on Jet Lag for all future episodes.
31:38 What? That was a Whitebait.
disliking just because of the rashuns slander. how dare you
Finally another bardcore fan. Toby you got class mate
Oh god the mispronunciations are brutely murdering me.
I am so jealous of toby’s hair
The fact that they had to specify non human so Sam won’t say his name to a stranger
"Non-human animal" 😂 They've learned from their mistakes
My favourite time of the week! 🥳 also why is Ben dressed as Mario?! 😂
bro I can't with most of the Maori pronunciations being from New Zealand
You can't review Bluebird chips without the Great Kiwi Dip!!! (That's reduced cream mixed with Maggi brand onion soup powder and it is an absolute Kiwi staple!)
Ben and Adam are wild for attempting the song challenge. I would have looked at the lyrics for 2 seconds before vetoing for sanity LOL. It takes longer than 45 minutes to memorize a song I love let alone one that is half-nonsense to a foreigner to NZ.
i dont even pay for survivor why wuld i pay for this shit?
The waterfall challenge and the way they could skip it with a 50-50 chance without even seeing the actual waterfall is the only part so far in all of the Jet Lag seasons that I think the game design was really broken😂
1:30 get out
This is a genuinely fantastic advert for New Zealand tourism! Also as a kiwi I'm so jealous of your experiences! I can't believe you were in our country!
i was so happy when i saw you were doing this in our beautiful country and i cant tell whats funnier, ben and adams reaction to rashuns or how they pronounce the maori words
"I'm tired, filled with cream, and my back hurts" uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
How supportive Ben and Adams teamwork is 🥹🥹🥹
this is weirdly cool. not going to be paying money for anything. ill wait.. for now
Welcome to New Zealand.
For 20 questions, “is it one of the people currently playing jetlag” would have been like the 2nd thing I would ask. Because random thought tends factor in the current situation.
Ben and Adam in the tunnel was phenomenal!
wait sam is the co-founder of nebula?
When they keep messing up in the tunnel I was dying laughing
Man this is so exciting, what a great idea tho go on a road trip and make the whole trip a board game love this show
Would be cool to have a future season guest be a fan! Also, I volunteer :)
I only just discovered The SnackZone but I already can't live without it.
Damn, I want to visit New Zealand now, looks so amazing
Awesome season 👏🏽
Ben and Adam are such a cute couple
22:37 I mean, we DO have penguins down here, so you could have seen one
I love you guys
As a kiwi, my apologies to Ben and Adam that you experienced Rashuns 🤢, I promise we have better snacks than that 😅
ben seems like adams little son sometimes especially on the kayak
Absolutely enjoyed this😂😂
Only found you guys last episode but as someone who grew up at the top of New Zealand this is so good omg
I need an Okaihau Express music video RIGHT NOW
I like how Sam and Toby are the ones who were required to compliment each other, but Ben and Adam just do it naturally while they're taking the scenic route. Adam telling Ben that he's good at spotting birds is one of the most heartfelt compliments anyone could give.
If they don’t get date by the end of this I’m raising hell  LOOK AT HOW SHE LOOKS AT HIM
My favourite part of non-kiwi people is the. pronouncing Māori words
I want kids from you
Why did he have to say “Auckland” like “Uhckland” 😭
I already know that in Auckland they will have to jump of the bridge or the sky tower
In New Zealand, it is illegal to say F**k
I live in nz and I dislike rashines
no way new zealand on youtube?? my country!
1:20 in and I want Snak Boiz every season.  Edit: I got to 26:00 and this is even better.
The tunnel makes this episode so much more better
“Come here and let me feed u cream.” Adam knew exactly what he was doing.
Watching two Americans struggling to sing Peter Cape and swearing while doing it made my day.
“Come here and let me feed you cream.” Well alrighty then!
taking the western route seems like a no brainer
loved the snack zone!
Good one
This episode has been basically a love letter of where I grew up and man it brings back memories. Incredibly lovely part of the world.Definitely should have just asked the bloke to jetski and should have swum Rainbow Falls though! Fuck yes Northland 💙🐉
CREAM TRIP WITH NO LOADS REFUSED
Fun fact: New Zealand is nearly invasive species free, and a small section is. I learned that from Tom Scott (who is also the way i found Jet Lag)
*Dice
For an American you say our maori names really well
NOBODY hurts Ben & Adam!!!!
Lots of choice words said during that Cream run
I hope we get a drunk Ben challenge again this season. It has become a Jet Lag staple.
“i’m tired, i’m filled with cream and my back hurts” - ben
Your pronunciation of NZ words are to notch 😂
Lets go sam and toby
Anyone know what's the app they use to track each other?
Oh, I'd maybe buy a sweatshirt that said The Snack Zone.
What a fun way to experience my own country, I hope you've thoroughly enjoyed your time in the land of the long white cloud
I don’t know why but I’m always rooting for Ben and Adam. Always. Sorry Sam
I need to show this to my dad, he grew up in Northland. Kinda sad they didn't go to rainbow falls though, is always pretty.
I no nothing about you lot. I love my country. If you are from here much respect, If not I hope it was a respectful enjoyable journey. kia kaha new zealand
Toby's pronunciation of NZ place names is so poor its actually embarrassing lol
A bit of freindly advice Kaeo is Pronounced Kai O   many of the Maori names  use A (a) E (eh) I (E) O (ouh) U (ew)
Part 3 of underestimating fising
I should be reading act 2 of King Lear rn
You should at least drop a link to your guest YT page in the description
sam should cut his hair.
Madea's New Zeland Class Reunion ©️2003
Dude I’m obsessed with these guys, I really appreciate this content and all the effort and creativity, it makes my week every week
One of the best episodes across the board! Sam needs to up his compliment game though xD
so fun seeing the best of NZ highlighted with the snorkelling and kayaking and all that. Awesome stuff.
Greatest series on YT rn
“…drippin’ from the sack” - Adam. Live by them words baby!!
The sexual tension between Ben and Adam was already a lot. Now the tension between Sam and Toby is too much. Love the show ❤
Oh my god that fucking ending  I wonder how Ben & Adam are going to pull through… man I love this series so much
took me two whole episodes to realize Toby is the fourth dimension person from tik tok
I love how they specified the animal couldn’t be human.  Remember jet lag season 3?
I think having a series like this with three teams would be amazing
You got the worst flavor of chips 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Bro really said lemme cream in your mouth 💀💀💀💀💀
I think at this stage I never care about the competition, I just want to watch Ben and Adam fumble their way through a country, together.
Oh man, when did Ben get drunk? That obstacle course was rough
Nice
I just can't stop rewatching this 30:53
I hope you understand the endless joy these bring me
It's wild that you youtubers make better content than most fully staffed production companies
Is adam gay
23:10 'I'm full of cream and my back hurts'......
slayyyyy
the compliment segment on top of the peak was really sweet  also sam was trying to be really secretive of his disdain for math, then just outright admitted that Toby was making video ona subject he originally did not like lmao
21:26 the crickets I think they are make my throat feel like it's vibrating.
Adam's review of Bay of Islands: 7.8/10 too much water
Yo guys really good series! Honestly you could try sell this to NZ tourism or get it sponsored or something? Great work. Toby! Learn proper maori pronunciation girl!!!! This was your chance to educate the masses on our culture and as a white new zealander you need to make an effort! Big ups to you all anyway.
I think, this is my favorite episode on Jet Lag! xD Non-Human Animals (for Sam not doing the Sam-thing again), the adrenaline park, cream... It was just hilarious! Thank you so much!
I memorised the song just cause of Ben and Adam singing it
incredible episode
Your cool bird is an Oystercatcher! They are indeed cool birds.
Your game is the best way to discover and appreciate New Zealand. Great job.
I appreciate the professionalism of having real closed captions on this.
Ben and Adam attempting to sing the lyrics and failing misserably (but succeeding)  4:13 5:20 6:32 8:16 10:00
Idk if it’s intentional but the music that plays whenever a road is unlocked sounds really similar to the victory music from Mario and I die a little inside whenever I don’t hear the ending bit of the Mario music in this lmao
"THIS IS THE OKAIHAU EXPRESS" - Adam
LMAO THE SPIDER WEB IN BEN'S AND ADAM'S CAR MIRROR
Can't believe how beautiful this country is!
On the road again, we can't wait to get you on the road again.
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE THEM TO SING THE SONG OMG IM DYING
12:59
Man, Episode 3 on Nebula is really awesome. This show just gets better, you could say it rings all my bells..
Ben adam adreanline park go there all the time hope to see you in nz
I'm really rooting for Sam & Toby because of the devastating defeat Sam & Brian suffered last season, but I definitely like the dynamic with Adam & Ben this season.
So, with the Lucky Swim, if you only swim if you don't roll a 1, 2, or 3, but you have to keep rolling until you do roll a 1, 2, or 3, is there any point where you have to swim? Is it only the first roll that counts for swimming, but you can't go to swim until you've rolled 1, 2, or 3?
TOBY'S NAILS!!! So cool 👏🙌
Seeing my favourite YouTubers in the small town I live in but not seeing them while they were there💀💀💀💀💀
I would love the Nreals just so I can finally go on walks and be able to watch YouTube, be a fat man trying to he skinny man's dream
"you're SO good at spotting cool birds, Ben" "thank you"  idk i just love them
4:15 little did Adam know of his pain that was yet to come
This has gotten so well made. Next level production guys
Ben on that first obstacle had me laughing so hard… but I know that would have definitely been me 😂
snack lag...
Adam: "Do you have kayaks?" Guy With 20 Kayaks on Beach: "...No."
Just make sure Ben never end up on Wipeout
The Snack Zone better feature in every future Jetlag series, the graphics, the music, it's so amazing
Who edited this and made the jingles? Was this intentional? Green Eyed Lady at 38:14? It's not exactly the same obviously, but that immediately made me think of that song.
Non-human animal, the clear PTSD
Yo im from new zealand but ur from us lol
as someone who has recently developed a balance/vertigo issue, watching ben do that obstacle course on an empty stomach after however much rigorous activity with the kayaking genuinely stressed me out. but i'm really enjoying the design of this season!
Let’s just take a moment to appreciate Toby’s nails
I ❤ that Toby has her nails done with the Jet Lag logo!
OYSTERCATCHER <3
With how disgusted I am with cream, I'd have to take the other route
Hearing them butcher their pronounce „Hundertwasser“ is so funny! Now they have to do a Season in Central Europe with Germany and Austria as well, no one would know where they are based on how they would pronounce certain names. And in Vienna there is a Hundertwasser-House and in Uelzen in Northern Germany the whole train station has been designed by him!
Did Ben have Vegemite before the obstacle course? No other way to explain the clumsiness before a "get Ben drunk" challenge
Thanks for the great content again! Wednesday is now my favorite day of the week!!!
12:19 that cobweb 💀
Idea: Race across New York! Same idea but you have to travel from Niagara Falls to Suffolk County, NY.
Hopefully they see a clock through the window with the right time.
znack boys is my favorite show
Toby ftw!
19:01 That's what I was wondering
Snack boys with Z. First snack - Rashians... Sounds like Russians Z
Visiting a tree... that has to be the most mundane way to explain going to see Tane Mahuta. One of the largest trees in the world.   Video and pictures do not do justice to how big that tree really is.
"Is it a singer?"  "No"  Excuse me, I think you'll find that Ben's singing earlier in the episode was beautiful
This is a good video but it’s a bit to long, if you make it shorter is better
8:52 I feel your pain, Adam
I really appreciate the color-codes and detail put into the captions!
Also, Toby is a delight, really good pick for 4th player.
Adam: gliding effortlessly through obstacles and turning back to film Ben Ben: dragging himself across the finish like the broken husk of a man
Bro felt attacked after eating a cheesy bacon ration😂.
Ben has the worst balance I have ever seen
20:32 whats up guys, in todays video were gonna visit tane mahuta AT 3 AM!! make sure to hit the subscribe button guys and hit the thumbs up, one like equals one prayer for the sirenhead impostor! anyway guys, lets just jump right in!
CHALLENGE COMPLETED MAKE THE THINGY POP UP
Ben is such a passenger princess even in the Kajak I love it for him
Are Ben and Adam gay?
It‘s quite obvious why sam is always behind, he always has the worst mates.  Ben and Adam best Dou❤
ADAM AT THE TUNNEL WAS KILLING ME LOLLL
Id watch The Snack Zone with Ben and Adam
If nebula had Ben and Adams's Frantic Adventures as a show I would sign up!
Again I love the frantic real style of Ben and Adam. vs Sam and Guest who always try to game the game.
Tobys got a math channel? Whats it called?
I would love to watch the Snack Boys Sack time show.
Idk, there's just something about watching two men cream in each other's mouths that I simply wasn't expecting when I opened the video. Seriously though, new Zealand is beautiful and I hope to go one day
New Zealand is my country and is gaming also I very love the pronouncements lol
Ben "full of cream and my back hurt" Me "what video did I click on?"
I love Adam's enthusiasm
was ben drunk in the water park?  Cause he was moving like one, pure gold
The pronounciation has me rolling around on the floor laughing Here's how you pronounce Maori vowels: A: ah E: eh I: eee O: o (like honk) U: ooo Also Maori has very long vowels and the macrons make them much longer
"im very tired, very full of cream, and my back hurts"
I've always shipped Ben and Adam, but I didn't expect to watch them cream each other in a YouTube video.
So you’re a thinly cut person
what kind of cream will u be eating? Explicit version
The attention to detail in the caption editing at 5:28 is outstanding
Imagine taking your kids to the tunnel and you're like, " so kids this is where your mom and I met," and you just hear," FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK"
Hey, I would really like for you to use more local restaurants and showcase their cuisine in this way. You are setting somewhat of a bad example with your amount of fast food consumption. I get that you have only 30mins for lunch but does it really have to be McDonalds every time?
Amazing work on the captions/subtitles ! They've done a great job
All the comments here are praising Ben and Adam, and it is very true that they are extremely lovable and a truly great duo. However, maybe it is just me, but I think that Sam and Toby are also an impressive duo this time. I feel like Sam's previous partners (Brian and RealLifeLore) were not too entertaining to watch and, while I like Sam, his team was always lacking. However, Toby is an extremely lovable person. I really like her personality and her dynamic with Sam is really fun to watch. Sam has finally found a fitting partner for himself in Jet Lag and I love it.
Does anyone have or known where I can find the full scene of sing the song by Adam and Ben?
Ben and Adam’s frustration is screaming through the screen. I felt bad for laughing
In New Zealand, just like real life, there are many paths to the bottom
29:10 The way he fell in after the very first obstacle 😭😭😭
non-human animal haha
HOW DO YOU NOT LIKE RASHUNS?!!! I LVE THEMM
"... dripping from the sack". That one was no accident 😂😂!
#GENOCIDE
Ben in the adrenaline park is me trying to do any kind of physical work 😂
Sam's rizz at the peak is unmatched...fr
I can't stop laughing at Ben at the Adventure Park😂😂
Being from NZ, you chose the wrong snack by choosing rashuns.
yay so exciting
"A show within a show" about snacks, the "Snack Zone" - c'mon, these guys listen to the McElroy brothers, right?
I love your videos, I don’t know if it’s in the realm of possibility, but what if you made an app that let you take a map of a place and turn it into a board game like this and it would keep track of your coins, and what roads are unlocked, and the store and all that. Just a thought.
Y’all should link Toby’s channel in the description
Seeing Sam scratch a lottery ticket with his fingernails set off some PTSD from my years working at a convenience store
i love how the cars they bought or rented have been sitting for so long the BMW is literally full of cobwebs.
Love this channel and every new season is so fresh and fun keep up the good work guys!! You have an amazing show going here
19:34 Did Adam really just say "that's not great" about the freaking best whipped cream in a can I can get where I live??
What card game does Ben play? 👀
I am also a huge fan of bardcore!  Glad I'm not the only one 😅
Is Ben there to slow Adam down? Every season it's the same thing!
didn't even go for the "All Snacks"
22:38 Ben (excitedly): Is that a penguin?! Adam (immediately and exasperatedly): No.
this episode was great for Team Sam
I'm a Kiwi who's been living in Australia for the past 4 years and this season makes me miss home so much, love the weekly dose of nostalgia ❤You've all done a great job designing and completing the challenges in a way that makes New Zealand shine and I'm learning a lot of stuff that I didn't even know about which is super cool!
15:27 The Medieval version of Real Slim Shady is almost better than the original!
Ben & Adam will never fully forget that song as long as they live
I think Sam and Toby balance each other out pretty well. Sam always wants to do too much and Toby has such a chill and calm energy. I would love to see those two together again in the next seasons <3
How often do you think Ben and Adam practice putting “cream” in each others mouthed
I love that the rules have to specify a 'living, non-human animal' now because of Sam finding a loophole in earlier episodes
they be going to way more places than people that live here do lol
Excited to see what the Orewa/ Waiwera /Silverdale challenge will be next week (if either team goes there), assuming it will probably be Snowplanet or something to do with the Waiwera water bottling plant (as the hot springs are closed).
Compliments to Toby on the best taste in music. More than I can say for Sam. Still rooting for him though.
They're going to have that song stuck in their heads for the rest of the season!
Rashun's are awesome fight me.
The song in the tunnel is like Morse code.
23:09 I'm very tired, I'm full of cream and my back hurts  Am I on the right website?
znack boys?
They can look through the window at least to see if there’s a correct clock.
"I'm very tired, very full of cream, and my back hurts" Yeah take that out of context....
If you do a game in wales make one of the challenges "correctly pronounce Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogo"
Is it just me or was Ben and Adam extra annoying this episode?
"I'm very tired, I'm full of cream, and my back hurts" -Ben
I wasn't sure who to back in this, but after that attack on our beloved Rashuns my choice has been made!
I love Toby's JetLag inspired nails!
I love this series some Maori pronunciation lessons before you guys started would have been smart lmao
The editing on the Okaihau express and lyric sheet was superb, great episode!
"How many have we completed" "One" "Shut up". Ben is my spirit animal
I'm glad they specified non-human animal this time lol
Quick Māori pronunciation guide because even Toby isn't pronouncing it correctly  Just like in English, Māori has 5 vowels: A: cAr E: Egg I: sEE O: fOr U: tOO  If you see an accent (ie. Ā) simply lengthen the sound of that vowel. Māori also only has 8 consonants: H, K, M, N, P, R, T, W. R is a trill R, like Spanish, NG creates the same thiNG sound as English, and confusingly WH is pronounced like an English Fish
I think Okaihau Express truly tested Ben and Adam's friendship. If it survived memorizing and singing that song, it can survive anything.
"Clearly visible, living, non-human animal", they really cracked down on Sam's rules lawyering lmao.
I love jetlag but i hate how they advertise the nebula subscription. It's like if you're impatient, you can get an episode now but you still have to wait a week after that and then you have to maintain that subscription so you dont fall behind
Red team!!
Actually the worlds tiniest fish was on s2
Is the unedited version of their song on Nebula?  😮😮
Pro tip for anybody who has to memorize something - write it down by hand a few times along with saying it out loud. It really helps!
I hope yall will visit hobbiton
There’s no get drunk challenge yet! So what the hell happened to Ben at the water park?! 🤣
I love the contrast between Super Serious Sam, and Ben and Adam who are just having fun
"I'm very tired, I'm very full of cream, and my back hurts" -Ben from Jet Lag
23:09 Ben: "I'm very tired, full of cream and my back hurts" is the best and weirdest thing i have heard in a while
The adventure park killed me. Ben immediately runs towards the first obstacle, a small ledge, and promptly falls over it. Not deterred, he quickly gets up and continues on his path, only to fall almost immediately into the water after slipping.  Amazing.
im sorry to break it to adam but the "bay" in "bay of islands" already denotes the body of water XD. it is a body of water surrounded by lots of islands, if it was a "bay of water" it would be a sea or an ocean XD
Ben and Adam are the best duo
Seeing Ben and Adam diss rashuns hurt my soul a little
Cowree tree 😞
Release the decks? …please?
Sam, “That’s how the jet lags” is something that I both doubt and really hope will stick.
13:44  imagine if the tree got destroyed out of some freak storm
I wait to see the Snack Zone in the next season too 😂
Toby is hot. Like in a smart-hot way.  That's all I had to say, thanks.
i really enjoyed the snack zone in this episode
hey ben and Adam could still have a chance at completing the challenge if they can see from outside one of the clocks that display the right time
Can you do a video set in Australia?
The snack zone should be in every episode
Adam: *looks through the door* Adam: Wait I FOUND ONE Edit: I didn't expect this to actually happen
Medieval Eminem is the best!
Ok ok. You win. Ima go get Nebula
its funny that sam and toby were lookimg at a very famous tree while ben and adam were eating whipped cream on islands
But Ben isn't drunk 😂😂
I love everything about JetLag, except for the fact that they still consider McDonald's a proper meal. Especially when they're in a foreign country and could taste some wonderful local cuisine instead... I get that they're on a time crunch and want to spend their time in the car planning strategies rather than where to stop for food but it's a bit of a waste to not explore and experience the area fully while there imo.
Ben and Adam could've just gone back to the kayak rental place instead of the final island because North Island is still an island
26:55 I recently saw Hundertwasser's house in Magdeburg, which is quite famous, like the Hundertwasser House in Darmstadt. There are tourists who just travel around the world to see those buildings.
I really hope that they have a challenge involving pronouncing Taumatawhakatangi­hangakoauauotamatea­turipukakapikimaunga­horonukupokaiwhen­uakitanatahu
19:16 "come here and let me feed you cream! be careful of your little feet 🥰" I ship Ben and Adam so hard LOL
I love the snack zone and the dedication of the graphics team to it.
3 dollar scratchy....... Fiddy bucks
Man was able to upload Episode 2 before Ludwig realized a new season has started.
Would love to see a season of this using the Ring of Fire in Iceland.
how is Ben and Adams pronunciation of Māori words so much better then Tobys? SHES A KIWI!??!/
We’re renaming the channel to The Snack Zone right?
i'd like to imagine that at 22:35 sam thought the Tāne Mahuta was based on the tree from Avatar
having to do the obstacle course after having kayaked for like an hour would have been rough. I feel you, Ben.
I love the snack zone and Ben’s big bud press overalls
*They only put in that you must touch a NON-HUMAN animal because in one of the previous seasons Sam touched Ben and Adam when he needed to touch an animal.*
That adventure water park looked like the greatest thing ever! Well Ben and Adam didn't seem to love it, but I feel like I could spend days on that thing.
Honestly, if Ben is half as blind as I am, it's impressive how well he did at the AdventurePark. I know I have terrible nearsightedness and wouldn't be able to do that well.
Queens town
Who would have thought the next big YouTuber group would be educational YouTubers
so cool that Hundertwasser did toilet art in New Zeeland :)
I'm excited for yall to get to the south island! 😁
4:51 Can't believe Sam willingly turned down a Kate Shep like that.
Definitely weird seeing a block of toilets on YouTube and saying I've peed there.
😀
Episode 2, yay!
When was this filmed? As the state highway into okaihau from north has been closed due to a slip since august 2022!
Whys my dude dressed as Mario
I absolutely adored this episode. Love the location and the love for NZ. Toby's amazing - she balances Sam out so well. Ben and Adam as ever are hilarious - I was dying at the cream trip and the obstacle course. Can't wait to see where this season goes!
I love Bens outfit so much <3 jez
31:07 Anybody that has worked in retail/customer service night shift will recognize this face... 1 minute past closing time, this one mf
Ben: i'm full of cream and my back hurts.   Adam: yea...  later in the video they both got rid of that cream, with falling in the water, or atleast ben fell
A great episode. I find the ones not set in America better as the central three having local knowledge takes some of the jeopardy out of it all.
"non-human animal" I see you guys have learned from your previous lack of specificity😂
Swallowing lake water is never a good idea
There is no freaking way I would be able to complete the song challenge, period.
29:49 so glad Ben is keeping the tradition of getting drunk alive
On the road again, just can't wait to get on the road again, the life I love is making music with my friends, and I can't wait to get on the road again
Imagine showing up to the Clock Museum at the wrong time...
Adam: come here and let me feed you cream LMAO
We need an uncut clip of the Okaihau Express singing.
I would love to sign up for Nebula when it gets XBox and PS5 apps
Truly can't decide if the swearing during the song challenge or the wipeouts on the obstacle course are the more hilarious part of the episode. Wonderful, and so grateful it's so long! Also I continue to be a fan of Toby and her attitude!!
I really like how the challenges are based off of the local geography and attractions, would like this to continue in different series
Watching this and just trying to figure out if Sam and Toby are just matching or are actually sponsored this season. 😂
The Layover might just get me back on to Nebula again
toby is so kind and such a good jetlag gamer im so glad shes on this season <3333
Hahahaha I don't know if I' m evil for this but the part with Ben in the watermark was so funny I couldn't stop laughing through the hole sequence. But seriously my man was struggling and it showed big respect for going through it any way
Ben and Adam wanted to review snacks but got unlucky and chose Rashuns. I don't know a single person here that likes them and there's much better snacks here.
It's actually unfair how beautiful the nature in New Zealand is!
I have been there it's soooooo big
.
In fairness rashuns are awful now. Haven't bought them since they changed the recipe a few years ago
What is Toby’s channel?
Why does Ben look like a drunk baby?
Safety first, You should not have your swimwests unzipped when kayaking.
Your pronounciation of Hundertwasser sounds so funny to me
I'm cheering for you, my little creamy boys!
That challenge with the Song is amazing! :D
I hope they sing the gumboot song later
such an awesome episode :D also please if toby is interested and has the time bring her back in future seasons! She is such a great addition to the crew :)
Maybe I missed this in Ep 1, but Toby’s braid is IMPRESSIVE!
I expect the Snack Zone to be present on future games!
If there is anything to be learned from the last to episodes, it is to always take the safe and consistent route
Even when Ben and Adam make the games, it's hard not to root for them XD
Go fast go fast, key is speed
I wish I was as good as Ben at spotting cool birds...
Toby introducing herself to the fish was so wholesome 🥹
Toby loves bardcore I'm obsessed
I would watch a whole series of Ben going over more obstacles
28:43 but it says each one has to complete 10 different challenges? they did both the same ones
Fill this man with cream!
Please release the full cut of Ben and Adam singing the Okaihau Express somewhere, Nebula, Spotify, Soundcloud, whatever 🙏
i thought she looked very similar to tibees, this explains it lol
Tbh, the rewards seem really weird. Looking at a tree for 5 minutes gives you more points than doing 10 challenges in a water park which gives you the same amount of points as going to a toilet?
Excellent series. Much better than The Greatest Race or any other show, love this stuff
The confidence with which Adam sings "drippin' from the SACK" had me doubled over laughing. That was the funniest possible way he could have screwed up that lyric.
I would really like to be your Nebula subscriber, I love all your videos sooo much. But I'm from Russia, and it is just impossible
I wish to marry Ben
Love how Sam doesn’t want to be an obnoxious youtuber, aka more than 90% of yt shorts
Ben and Adam fucking the song up so much got me cracked up Haha
Every great show eventually has a musical episode. Jet Lag never disappoints
(I haven’t seen future episodes so no spoilers, but) We can see clocks through the glass, so I’m hoping those count as “on display” and Ben and Adam can get the time without going in!
Seeing Toby so spent on that hike I was immediately looking for it online and it says "Easy 0.5km, 40m elevation"... 😂 poor Toby!! I hope they don't go on any climbs anymore cause New Zealand is full of them and they're 600 times harder/longer than that.  Reminiscing on NZ. So fun. Had such a great time, and saw so many beautiful things (Including Tane Mahuta). Can't wait to see how this unfolds. This series is genuinely a walk down memory lane for me.
I think you forgot to include the challenge where Ben got drunk again.
Ben failing the water challenge was so funny lmao
Ben and Adam look like NPC’s at adventure Park
Ben and Adam once again overestimating their kayaking abilities.
My man the snack zone is grate
"I'm very tired, very full of cream, and my back hurts" - Ben 23:10
This was possibly the most frustrating and entertaining challenge EVER
Suggestion: Make a real board game based on this and sell it as merchandise. I think it could sell quite well.
24:45 it almost seems made on purpose that the parked Ford's licence plate begins with "JET"
RELEASE THE BEN AND ADAM OKAIHAU EXPRESS FULL CUT
The water park had me in tears, that was some of the funniest content I've seen so far this year 🤣🤣
7:20 and 8:52 is the most violent thing I have seen
I swear it’s impossible to click off of your videos, keep it up guys!
Uessss
The Okaihau Express part was masterfully edited! edit: ok, the whole video is lol
What a delight it is to watch you guys.
I’d like to see a “Race up I-95” or “Race up the US East coast”
in case you were wondering Sam here are the lyrics to on the road again.  One, two, a one, two, three, four  On the road again Just can't wait to get on the road again The life I love is making music with my friends  And I can't wait to get on the road again On the road again Goin' places that I've never been Seein' things that I may never see again And I can't wait to get on the road again  On the road again Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway We're the best of friends Insisting that the world keep turning our way And our way Is on the road again I just can't wait to get on the road again The life I love is makin' music with my friends And I can't wait to get on the road again  On the road again Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway We're the best of friends Insisting that the world keep turning our way And our way Is on the road again Just can't wait to get on the road again The life I love is makin' music with my friends And I can't wait to get on the road again And I can't wait to get on the road again
The struggle in the tunnel was beautiful, you should release the song on Spotify
22:12 Do they not have oystercatchers in the US?
Ben and Adam are a National treasure
specifying "non-human" animal after last seasons shenanigans XD
i think that lake water had alcohol in it ben was acting drunk as hell
Ben might not have gotten drunk YET, but he sure did act like it
I like how the entire audience has decided that Adam and Ben are the greatest duo to ever exist and tbh I agree
Sam and Toby seem to be getting on each other’s nerves
Beedle the Bardcore gonna be getting some new subs today
19:17 *Come here and let me feed you cream*
tips from an avid kayaker who felt bad watching this, put as much of the paddle as possible in the water and perpendicular to the water to move the fastest with the least amount of energy
“My name is Toby” -kunta kinte
Toby has been fantastic this season
At 30:50 I went ROFL Adam: This is another one. This is easier. Ben: Slams into water in 2 seconds 😂
Adam’s reaction while doing the song kept me entertained while I may or may not have been doing my standardized test
they need to release all the uncut footage of ben and adam memorising that song, I feel like it'd be hilarious
They wonder if the song was dirty.  Meanwhile Adam: but no-one knows the difference when they're drippin from the *sack*.
8:48  Absolute PAIN 🗿
Toby ♥♥♥
I need Ben and Adam to apply for the Amazing Race. With four seasons of experience under their belts, they should be prepared for a decent amount of challenges on the show
Ben: lets Adam rowing the kayak. Then, Ben: "I'm tired and my back hurts."
I love Ben and Adam, they make such a great team lol!!!
Ben and Adam look like hostages when they're not talking in the ad.
Adam: "Come here and let me feed you ✨cream ✨" Me: "This had better not awaken anything in me."
Is this really how American's pronounce Hundertwasser? Also, didn't even knew he was so popular in New Zealand that they made a public toilet in his design xD
Tobis smile is contagious
Does Vitoing not freeze you at the location you Vetoed? Seems a little cheesy to start in the car and pulling out of the parking lot as the time ends.
We have the best new host in Toby, but I still root for Ben & Adam, sorry not sorry Sam.
Pls do and Series in skandinavia
The train singing lol
Man episode 3 was good on nebula
im always questioning when how long they record these videos before they release it
Toby being a fan of bardcore makes me happy.
You hate rashuns?! They are the best
Love Jet Lag! Also can u sneak peak when will Ben get intoxicated 👀? Cmon its a tradition at this point
bro the singing bit was crack up, what the hell kind of game is this lmao
That's how the jet lags xD
As a casual kayaker, hearing Adam so optimistic about how long it was going to take to get to all 3 islands and back was quite funny. Should've tried harder for the jetskis lol
I have a question, do you think you will ever do another Tag across Europe/ Tag across somewere else?
As soon as I saw that song I thought I would have vetoed immediately.
The "Hunter Watson" toilet😂😂😂😂😂
There's a spider somewhere in Ben & Adam's car (it's house is behind the rear mirror) 😅
4:37 omg she has jet lag nails!! so cute!
"I'm very tired, full of cream, and my back hurts" -Ben
"non-human" lol that feels like a spiteful addendum
The non human animal line is definitely because of what Sam pulled off the other Jetlag season
As always, love the juxtaposition editing between them chatting about what the team is probably doing and the team actually doing it
Truly excellent I can’t wait for the next video! Also I loved seeing Ben & Adam (mostly Ben) just get destroyed on the obstacle course at sea! Also that old tree was incredible and yes Sam I Googled it the Avatar tree was loosely based off of it… Also trying to have Toby swim and tell a fish her name was awesome and so funny! 😊 When does E3 come out!😊
❤ Snack Zone Music 😂
29:12 Is Ben drunk again?
Now, I'm not subscribed to Nebula, but I definitely think I can guess how this cliffhanger is going to resolve itself.  ...There are a gajillion clocks on display clearly visible through the museum's glass door and windows. Even with the museum being closed, I can't imagine that wouldn't count -- if you can confirm the time through the window to be within 15 minutes of the correct time, then you've "found a clock showing the correct time" at the museum. There is no need to actually enter the building to complete this challenge.  I sure hope that's what they do, and they don't do something foolish like veto it!
I highly recommend the podcast I have listened at it is honestly great (I'm not a paid shill or anything but certainly something for the super fans like myself!!!)
The song part is so hilarious! Can’t stop laughing! 😂😂😂😂😂
Very sus moment in 23:11 if I may say so lol
I take offense to the "completeness" of the obstacles. Some generosity there.
question: are the jetlag episodes uncensored on nebula?
They finally reached the tipping point where I couldn’t not subscribe to Nebula
Adam and Ben seeing a bird on a rock: "Cool bird!" Hypothetical Sam: "That counts as an island, right?"
Why does Ben do nothing
One thing thats not clear to me yet: Does everyone know beforehand what the challenges are and they plan their route accordingly? if not, when and how do they find out about what the challenge is?
Amazing  Now do it in Brazil I dare you
"Sam, you are very patient."  Cut to last season's mini golf challenge
Oh my god!! So many questions.........  12:30 I know it's supposed to be a rental car but why isn't it cleaned? There's a cobweb behind the rearview mirror! You are living with spider.....argggh eewww......not saying you guys are gross, i am saying IT IS GROSS  29:40 did you guys get alcoholic potato chips in snack time? Cause how is Ben soooooooo drunk 😂. He fell on the obstacle where he had to just walk.....huh?? Obstacle course was really the gold of this video and made me genuinely crack up 😂 man i love ben ❤️
Ben and adma have to win.... otherwise it's not a good season 🙂🙂😁
Do your next jetlag in the Netherlands the country is so organized in every way. I think you can create a really cool game their
how do ben and adam get better every season?
Adam is like a supportive dad to Ben, and I’m here for it
Ben is still drunk from the other seasons at the adventure park 😂
ok
While Ben and Adam are a really funny pair, I’m still routing for Sam and Toby. They deserve the win!
The best series on yt
19:16 AYO?!
+1 for Snack Zone!
Can we please get the full cut of the tunnel song 🙌
Shoutout to Adam, Ben and Henry for the editing. The sound ambiance was really matching each place of interest 👏👏   Also, I have to point out that this episode just feels like "two groups of friends having fun on vacation and making a vacation film out of that"   (and I like that)   And, by the way, there may be a mistake in the subtitles at 19:39 (To my knowledge, it's "en route" and not "on route")
60 minute veto?! I thought it was 90.
Ben looks like Mario dude
And then the rest was history. The channel ended briefly into the second episode of the New Zealand series after two contestants won the lottery, and decided they never needed to work or do Jet Lag: The Game again. Adam Chase became a well-respected marketer for a high-value OnlyFans account Ben Doyle runs a high-value OnlyFans account Toby Hendy tragically died of a drug overdose at the age of 16 after running out of her lottery winnings And lastly, Sam Denby has disappeared from the face of the Earth. Some say he is wandering the jungles of the Congo, some say he is living with an aboriginal tribe in the Outback. Most others say they saw him on the corner of Park and 3rd drinking out of a paper bag
Best episode thus far!
Just loving all the place name mispronunciations 😆 & I used to climb that mountain (Tokatoka) as a kid on the weekends with my mates.
Absolutely laughing my ass off watching ben trying to clear that water obstacles 🤣
Remembering a whole song word for word when you've never listened to it before is REALLY hard, that is brutal 💔
Go rotorua. If you can. Do it.
@toby Bardcore is awesome for board game background music!
Skooshy cream.
Though victory is of upmost importance of course, I absolutely adore how Ben and Adam’s run throughs are also exciting vacations and funny peasy experiences
I love how the added the non-human part to the Kai Iwi Lakes challenge. Clearly a reference to Sam's question from last season.
Adam telling Ben how good he is doing is so wholesome. Their friendship is so wholesome.
26:00 SnackLag would be perfect
19:16 "Come here here and let me feed you cream!"
I guess its Magnus Carlsen
15:19, BARDCORE TO THE MEGA!
Toby having to explain what bardcore is is me trying to explain my music taste.
24:28 it would’ve been funny if Adam and Ben were singing the railway song from earlier 😂
I’d buy nebula if you release an uncensored fullcut of the Okiahou Express
Just when i thought i actually had to do my homework, you guys uploaded. Thanks for helping me procrastinate :D
So when we get the uncut version of the  Okaihau Express 😂😂
225th
I hope they still know that song by heart
Waiting for Ryan to join a season
Love Ben and Adam's chill vibes! Hoping that they get the win this season.
If one of the objectives of the game is to throw a piece of trash in lava I’m going to scream
Man, why is this one suddenly twice as long as usual?! Looking forward to it!
Non human animal rule was inspired by Sam 😂😂😂😂
The song in the tunnel was just evil
“Come here and let me feed you cream” I think that could have been rephrased in many different ways.
dddddddddddddddddd
best series on youtube, never stop!
Go team Ben and Adam! I love how they stuck to feeding eachother the cream, even if it was nowhere in the rules of the challenge. Also, is it just me, or is Sam giving of a vibe of a school boy terribly hitting on Toby this entire season? Like that whole segment at the big tree, one could cut the awkwardness in the air with a knife
15:16 I used to listen to some bardcore a few years ago. It's a bit odd when you hear about it, but it's pretty good I think 🤝
Ben is so uncoordinated
we need an uncut version of ben and adam revising the song
We need the uncut version of the song
is adam gay? just wanna knoww
hundertwatson public toilets..
what happens when the land rover inevitably breaks down?
Sam: lets not be obnoxious youtubers about this Sam less than a minute later: AnY hOt TaKeS oN ThIs SpIrItUaL tReE??
Not me shouting look through the window at the clock museum
Memorizing "The Okaihau Express" in a rail tunnel is a great bonding moment for sure
How long did they spend in the tunnel??
Sam is clearly a mountain goat
Cool
Non-human animal (27:54). Glad they specified it this time.
you could slowly see there soul leaving his body over the adventure park   Edit: I used the wrong there. its their.
You guys should do England form Scotland
Let’s goooo! 🎉
I love how Sams loophole talents made them have to specify "non human" animal
Ain’t no mountain high enough
I love Wednesdays because of you
I love that they have to specify non-human animal after the Brussels Incident
adam swearing in the tunnel is giving me life
That song is sooooooo long to memorize lol
The Snack Zone is such a vibe 😅
19:16 bro 😭
Let's go Erling haaland and Toby
I hope Sam wins this one for his own sanity
the all blacks shirts are why the have bad luck
The veto is 45 minutes for making a compliment 💀
you have spider web behind back-mirror :)  https://youtu.be/hfOy7pb0xXk?t=730
Yaaay new episode
Adam as always carry Ben all the way
I like how even when Ben isn't drunk he still completes obstacle courses like he's halfway though a handle
I love that the graphics for the NZ snack zone are the most Americanised stock images possible
I’m sure we’re gonna find a clip of Ben getting drunk in this series to extend the streak!
🤙🏼Biosecurity is rad🤙🏼
when you think that this thing is edited by sam but its not
Now i want a jetlag wipeout game xD
I don't know how I didn't notice Toby's hairlength until now (I suppose the content is just that good!), but I support said hairlength 100%
You should have brought two of those big foam dice. Would have been easier to see what was rolled :)
Have we talked about the massive cobwebs on Ben & Adam's rearview mirror???
Snack Lag
Ben continuing to fall at the water park was very funny. Somehow, Adam has suction cup feet
This episode was good but episode 3 is awesome.
Looks like Team Toby is driving a Land Rover Defender 1. Looked different in the previous episode because it went so fast.  I would have been screwed at the Song wall.
Still hate sam for the record
Ignore this comment as this is a personal msg for someone  Good night baby, i love you so much 💋💖
I wonder if they could just look through the window of the clock museum to find the right clock
26:03 The graphics team did not need to go so hard on this, but im so glad they did  The cheesy 80s/90s era intro/outro style honestly makes it even better, and is entirely befittin of "The Snack Zone"
AMAZING!!!
What’s the win/loss ratio again for Sam 0/5?
As a German, hearing Americans pronounce Hundertwasser was pretty funny :D
come here and let me feed you cream....lmaooo
I love the snack zone so much
Can't Ben and Adam just find the time through the window?
i want a full version of ben and adam singing the song.
36:23 BEST PART OF THE VIDEO.....
27:53 haha lol i like how they SPECIFICALLY mentioned "non-human" animal after sam cheesed that one in season 3! 🤣
Adam and ben
If Ben and Adam don't win I will be so disappointed 😭
I think all those times Ben was forced to get drunk clearly has had a long term effect on his balance.
This Video Series has to be secretly sponsored by the New Zealand Government
I’m so happy my mandated one day a week in the office corresponds with a Jet Lag day. Makes the train-ride melt away!
JET LAAAAAG BAAAABY
Sam: "That's how the jet lags, y'know"  Me: oMg hE sAiD tHE tHiNG!
I had a bad finals today so this makes me happy, although I should probably be studying for my next finals
I think Toby and Sam are a great pair!!!
the noise that exited my mouth at 29:12 can only be discribed as the unholy cackle of a deranged mountain goat
Love the series, and I think that it's a creative game. I enjoyed the time delay for  you to really enjoy the scenery rather than just racing through. I hope that you incorporate that in future games so you learn to really appreciate the moment than just live by a clock, so to speak. I also enjoy to the "show within a show" to giving an American perspective to new foods. Keep up the great work!
Jet lag makes my wednesdays so much better
Would love to see them do a state one where they have to race across a state and do challenges
This is so epic!!
Realised that Ben's scarf thing has the jet lag logo on it
I like how it seems like Ben and Adam is enjoying it all a lot more and not that much in a rush.
Best content and quality right now on youtubee
We team Ben and Adam all the way, love their chaotic singing
“Come here and let me feed you cream”
Love the NSMB-esque jingle for clearing a challenge!
Ah yes, definitely couldn't have asked the jet ski tour guide to just "tour" the islands instead for an extra fee under the table.... Dude totally would have been opposed to letting a couple yanks be eccentric.
there's no way the narrator and sam are the same person 😭
I love the snackzone!
15:08 I thought there was going to be an Audible ad.
tobys nails are great
I love watching Jet Lag, but I think it would be awesome if next season they mixed up the teams. For example: Sam and Ben, Adam and whoever they add.
Toby, thanks for introducing me to the world of Eminem BardCore.
Eminem bardcore always hits different! Impeccable taste!
Imagine if they added a interactive map so we could see all the chalenges
29:15 30:55 TIL that Ben is truly not an athletic creature
Need the full video of ben and adam trying to memorize the okihau express song
Damn, watching Ben and Adam failing at this stupid song for so long was devastating to watch. That song is really long, though, good job for getting it.
I already want Toby back in another season. She's good at this! And Sam needs her luck to make up for his.
“ i’m full of cream and my back hurts” - Ben
Am I understanding that challenge correct? You have to memorize a full song and sing it from memory? I feel like I'm learning something about myself here, because I could not do that if you held a gun to my head. I need literally two weeks of listening to a song on repeat to memorize it well enough to actually sing it from memory without having some kind of written cues.  Like, if I was on Ben and Adam's team, we would simply HAVE to veto it, I literally couldn't do it in that time frame. This isn't entirely new information for me, cause we used to have to memorize songs for music class in school and I was never able to do it. But I always assumed that it was because I just wasn't devoting enough time to it because I was lazy, but I guess it turns out that other people can memorize a song much, much faster than I can if this kind of challenge was thought of as reasonable.
Ben and Adam only needed to go to 2 islands because they are cream on the North Island
I feel like ben and adam are just chilling this season. Getting excited to visit the bay of islands like tourists. Doing a bit of food review in between each challenge. Makes it more a fun episode lmao
„IT'S WAS! F*CK YOU!!!“ laughed so hard at this part 🤣
you guys are so awesome love your vids!!!
Episode 3 on Nebula.... But have to wait for the wife to get home. so in the meantime rewatch Ep 2!
I love that the challenge had to specify a non-human animal because of the tag challenge
i wonder how much actual time it took for them to sing the train song
never knew adam was so abusive in the tunnel yet supportive on the obstacles
Jet Lag Video = Happines
Highlight of my day :)
Were on the road again making music with our friends can't wait to be on the road again classic country music
sports star? Ben? lmao
Bad luck for Ben and Adam in those tunnels…..
8:18 they sure were having fun
7:03 best part
13:30 lmbo, you never know, a tree might get bored of sitting in the same place for 500 years and just get up and walk away :p
Mom wake up new jet lag
I sometimes love my shitty memory because then I always have a happy surprise for new episodes even if they're scheduled Also I love how thoughtful they are when planning all this stuff, especially with the food breaks, it just feels so caring even tho it's quite an obvious thing
Lizzo!!!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Oh shit. it’s been another week already
This is the year Sam WINS!! #TEAMSAMANDTOBY
Can not wait to see if Ben is going to do another drunk challenge at some point this season.
Let’s gooooooo part 2
These videos make Wednesday the best day of the week
I would love if there was an uncut uncensored version of Ben and Adam (trying to) sing Okaihau Express
Hi Sam
Yoo jetlag vid poggers
Me just looking at the cobweb in Ben and Adam’s car
You gotta get Ludwig on one of these
Yes I was waiting all week for this video!😊
This is gonna be a long season and I am super excited for it.
Babe, wake up, they uploaded a new Jet Lag video.
7:18 Jet lag release the uncensored version!!! I want to hear Adam loosing his mind
Too many cars in this series. Bring back the European public transport series.
It's hard to find anything funnier than Ben and Adam trying to memorize a song and immediately breaking into swearing when one of them messes up
Adam cursing is so funny to me💀
I love the swearing in the railroad tunnel
Hii
I’m so glad you guys are back!!
Ben Made the editing much more difficult with all the swearing at the tunnel
Add a comment...
"Hope you guys are having fun wherever you are" Adam: *agonised screaming*
What happened to the subtitles? They're of _way_ worse quality than the previous episodes...
My work day just got better
I love that YouTube is faster to notify ep 2 is out so I know ep 3 is out on nebula -___-... Also, how is it possible to be as unathletic as Ben lol
Oh Jetlag: The Game, a sight to behold A YouTube show that's truly one of a kind Each episode, a journey to unfold Through cultures and cities, a true find  The hosts, so vibrant, their energy high As they explore each place with zeal and glee From street food to landmarks, they do try To capture all that the city can be  The game itself, a challenge to complete With time and points, each city they race And yet, it's not just about the feat But the memories they make in each place  Jetlag: The Game, a true delight A show that takes us on a global flight.
Sam has got robbed so many times bro
I was waiting for this one 😍

You should do something in Australia
Why do everyone want to be the first comment?!?!?!??!
Wow. Actually found it 1 minute after release and already so many views.
