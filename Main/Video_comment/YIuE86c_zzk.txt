Great job penaldo 1 pen & a tap in not that bad
Bruno is so good man he need to stop being played at rw
Jota’s miss… like for real he has time to control one or two touches and score.
Where is the Litvania and Hungary match?
That cross from Ruben neves for the second goal was beautiful and very satisfying to watch
Portar trebuie cautat altu e slab rau
Would have my RESPECT if he didn't cry or argue with refs the drama queen
Seeing them all run off celebrating while Ronald was Rolling around dying on the floor was hilarious
👍🏻
2:03 😂 The commentators brain decided to merge Bosni and Herzegovina together. We've all had that moment 😂👌🏻.
They have to win the Euros with this tema and Ronaldos last major tournament
Portugal and England will be the biggest threats at next Euros trust me either one will win
they used to be a decent teal bosnia and herzeathingybob
And Leão and Jota were on the bench to save energy for Tuesday's game, not to forget others like Pote, Nuno Mendes, Renato Sanches, etc., who weren't even called up for the selection given the amount of options excellent players available for Portugal. ..
PUT RESPECT ON RONNY
Big bad Bruno
Everyone gassed over Fernandes against a team like this
0:30 SUIIiII
Bernardo Silva is most underrated player.
If Leao isn't playing I'm not interested 😤
Ronaldo is still a top player
ronaldo is underrated rn as  amn u fan i regret that we sell him
I just love Gary Taphouse’s commentary ❤️
Great game from Portugal 👍
Messi Has More Assists. Ronaldo Doesent Even Have The Second Most Assists.      Because His Teammates Cant Finish
My favourite player at United 👌
Bosnia should of scored a few making chances against one of the best sides in the world they should be proud of themselves
Love that idiotical hair cut from B Fernandes.  Having money is not enough to have sense.
Bruno Fernando's is not liked because he moans all the time, is always acting and diving and complains to the referee continually. It is so easy to hate him and his annoying antics.
Brunos shit and overrated. From a united fan.
Why did the keeper drop to his knees and allow that free kick to go straight through him? Even Karius would have saved that with ease.
bruno fernandes on fire. 🔥
It's amazing to see Cr7 playing with one touch, so clever!
Ronald still bringing it
Bruno, the ultimate stat padder
If only Ronaldo had this team when he was in his late 20s early 30s 🥹
cool
People who think Bruno isnt a top 5 midfielder in the world, dont know ball
Bruno deserves to have been in Fergie United's team, he's a world class player surrounded by average joes.
Bruno would be respected a whole lot more as a world class footballer if he kept his sh*thousery on the pitch to a minimum. Fact.
Any top flight team in the world would be lucky to have a player like Bernardo Silva he’s an absolute magician 🔥🫡
cool
The ghost of Lisbon penaldo 😂😂😂😂😂😂
cool
cool
Imagine if Bruno was at Man City - he’d be getting ballon D’or shouts instead he’s being wasted at a dead club
haha ronaldo on the floor whilst everyone celebrating, nobody likes the camel
cool
no lie bruno should’ve had like 40 assists this season if we had a real striker like osimhen
Portugal don't have pace in the team without Leao
BRUNO, BRUNO ❤
My CAM ! Bruno Bruno
The Portuguese squad is so star studded. They really should be winning Euro 2024 or close to
About time bruno started turning up for club and country
2 goals and 1 assists awesome.
Bruuuuuuuuunooooooo
ronaldo should have a assist dat game
Ronaldo still miserable unless he’s scoring then..
Cr7 no free kick and penalty = no goals 😂😂😂😂
Wow! Could have won that 5-0. CR7 denied 2 assists too!
Then sadly offside 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂
This time Ronaldo actually scored from the header
The way Ronaldo sets the table for his teammates. All the have to do is put the ball in.
Speed met Ronaldo
Bruno bruno bruno
Bruno is an absolute legend of a player regardless of what the haters think!!
Ronaldo can’t get an assist cuz whenever he passes they hate Ronaldo getting an assist bruv 😢
I’m sorry Bruno but where was this for the whole bloody season probably his best goal this season for Portugal
Djeko still calling himself a striker LOL
Bruno last goal brilliant and Ronaldo not even gone to celebrate 😮 maybe because he wanted a goal himself but still he should have gone to celebrate with his teammates
Penaldo not scoring? 😢
Ronaldo had a solid performance could of had a goal and 2 assists
I just started making YouTube videos. Does anyone have advice on how I can improve?
Brunoooooo
Bruno scores two goals but barely any other player celebrated with him just look at the reaction on the 3rd.
Whose here after SPEED meets Ronaldo
@RONALDO IS SHIT HAHAH! WASHED PLAYER U SUCK
They owe ronaldo so many assists 😭
Just Bruno doing what Bruno does
This is going to be known as the ishowspeed game 😂😂
As a United fan I have two things to state.  Firstly, how is our captain Bruno still playing like the season just began?   Secondly, sign Costa asap and cash in on Henderson and make De Gea number 2 goalkeeper.
Portugal: How did Bernardo score that banger?  Bernardo: I play for Manchester City duhh
Ronaldo was different level in this game 🔥
Who else thought that ishowspeed would pop up at the end of the video?
Bruno Fernandes a major part in the game, he deserves way more respect, Ronaldo was more of the major part of the build-up for a goal like how he passed to Fernandes who found space to give it to Silva and score, and at the age of 38, he’s doing nothing short of brilliant, this Portuguese could turn out to be something never seen before.
Great Game by Ronaldo, Bernardo and Bruno. If these 3 can consistently play like this together then Euro 2024 is a legit possibility
HOW DID HE MISS THAT SETTER FROM RONALDO!!!!!!?!!??!?!!!!!
What a performance from the 38 year old 😳
Ronaldo needs to retire now to let the youth come through. His shadow wont allow them to grow.
🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿
English media “Bruno and Ronaldo can’t play together” 😂
Ronaldo showing hes still got soemthing in him 😊
Bruno leapt like Ronaldo for that second
Ronaldo is so utterly miserable if he doesn't score. Token gesture celebrations with teammates.  Tbh I am surprised he didn't try to claim Fernandes 1st goal as his own
Ronaldo rolling around on the floor like a lemon during Bernardo Silva's goal is just too funny.
My mate asked me why Bruno was my favourite player, its because he's brilliant!
How did jota not score waaaaaaaa
As the biggest Messi fan, I want Ronaldo to win Euro. Simply because he’s better even at 38 than all others in Euro 2024.
AND THEN SPEED MET RONALDO AFTER THE GAME
Bruno Fernandes, say what you want about him but I think he’s underrated and over-hated, yes he may ‘complain’ a lot but that’s just passion and him fighting for the best for his team
Our Bruno ❤
Just so litle to do but what about that save from Diogo Costa? 👍
Ronaldo playing as a team player 🤔👍
W speed for meeting ronaldo
Bruno is too good
That finish from Bernardo was insane
Good performance from Portugal overall. Players seemed a bit fatigued at the start but they picked up towards the end.
Ronaldo robbed of 2 assists 😂😂😂
Only underrated player in Europe is one little man and his name is bernardo silva...mesmerising to watch undisputed best winger in Europe
Highlights fair reflection but Bosnia had a chance when they hit the crossbar from a cross that should have been included...
you gotta feel for ronaldo the man is 38 and portugal finally has a decent squad imagine if he was in his prime days or even in his early 30s with this squad they coulda done numbers
Ronaldos link up play is underrated
Cristianoffside peNALDO showing his class in 2023
Ronaldo Legend
This team is very selfish, everyone playing for themselves
if Bruno keeps it up for the season he will be more than ready
This Portugal team is so talented 🇵🇹👏
Put lethal finishers in front of him and this is what you’ll get
Bruno going crazy and people going crazy about him.omg its a minnow team.if he cant score even beat them then something wrong.notjing special at all.bruno still the moaning wining cry baby as ever.not underated he very overated
Speed net everyone and the Goat
Speed met ronaldo
this match will go down in history... for speed fanboys
What a team ronaldo cancelo fernandes felix jota Bernardo  It would be interesting against England,  promising game
all goals made in manchester
It's about time Bruno did something for Portugal.  He's been anonymous for years
Master Splinter 🐀
I love Bruno Such a baller
You can tell the last managers disrespected Ronaldo but this one has love for him
2 goals and an assist for Bruno, and people says he’s overrated. Get a top striker in and maybe another midfielder to rotate with Erikson and we’ll see the best of him at United! Shout out for Ronaldo too, unselfish and a top performance from him too
Shows you Bruno is good when he has a good striker like the Goat
Ronaldo played great, changed his game up to be more of a team player.
Lol throw a big team in front of Bruno watch him crumble . Mr small team merchant he's called in the blue side of Manchester 😂😂😂😢
Bruh I swear to god the amount of times ronaldo lays his teammates on a plate and they miss is a joke he should have double the assists he does
3:57 this is why ronaldo from this position would rather shoot than pass
Ronaldo seems to be down with the team, humbly. I like that.
Speed met ronaldo 🇵🇹
Again 2 assets by CR missed by his team mate😁😁🤣🤣
Portugal: Some excellent players. Good luck to them. Dzeko has been amazing in his career, unlucky not to convert that early chance.
Who’s here after Speed Meets Ronaldo
Ronaldos movement for the second goal was world class
If only Bruno does that every game
Lol these dead games
Scotland v Halaand comeback even better 😂
He don’t have a good look 😂underatted fair
Rutter Aproves  👌
bruno played brilliantly and ronaldo shudve had  one or two assists
Bruno Fernandes showing why he's world class
As a Portuguese im finally happy with Cr7 performance. He played for the team. First goal he was crucial with antecipation and pass. He made awesome passes to players in better positions that missed goals, where before he wouldnt do it, he would shoot, stick to ball, try to dribble in vain... Second goal he pulls all defenders to him leaving Bruno all alone to do header. He worked a lot and well. If he continues like this, playing for the team he is my nr1 striker for Portugal where before I was asking for Goncalo Ramos instead of him. Happy for Portugal Happy for CR7 FINALLY playing for the team.
Ronaldo part of the first 2 goals and should have had an assist
Carrega!
Ronaldo still scoring goals like he’s in his 20’s 😂😂
Idc what any1 says Ronaldo is clear. He's doing what is best for the team and not for him, old Ronnie would of dribbled past the defender and shot instead he passed(good choice) and the offside is unlucky he ran and jumped not concentrating at the defender rather than the ball which the defender stopped running
"A memorable victory" why? They'll have likely forgot about it in a months time. 😂
Roberto Martinez is one of the last people Id expect to have the balls to drop Ronaldo so no surprise there. He might as well have Pauleta on the bench too
Cancelo looks awful
Ronaldo is always off side 🤣🤣
Bruno deserves more respect than he gets from England
SIIIIIIIIIIIIIUUUU 🐐
Bruno gets way too much hate.
That jota miss 😭
In all honesty I Bruno performs good next season with a good striker he has to be put up with kdb
I promise you Bruno would get more g/a than kdb if he has an actual striker
What a team
portugal look so strong rn. ill be surprised if they dont get a wc in 2026
Bruno Bruno Bruno, Our Portuguese magnifico ✨
Bruno needs players around him at Man Utd to get these performances even more without having to run for 90+ mins 😂
bruno is so good
That Neves cross was perfect alongisde the header from Bruno.
Ronaldo is so shit he holds this team back and is preventing younger players getting a chance, just retire, you failed at international football and failed to score or assist in a world cup knock out game in 20 years, its over.
Bruno my star
Messi clear
Bruno Fernandes is so underrated
Ronaldos hold up play was good
