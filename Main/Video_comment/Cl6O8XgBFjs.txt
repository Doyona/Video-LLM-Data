They playing the game wrong
a lot of glazing from brodie
64 to 109 lol ok
Mark did hit the button first at the start. Wasn't even that close
That "god did " is soo cringe !
God Did
How am i just now seeing this?
AMP is ghetto they are the vibe killers
out of all Amp video collars this has to be the worst video I seen. I was not thrilled or laughed at all..wtffffff
wow ANOTHER RIGGED VID
This was thee funniest event ! I have to come back every year and watch this 🤣
The fact that RDC had 436 points and didnt even play 4 rounds is actually hilariously insane since its posed to be an 100 person survey
These mf so sorry 😭 For Fasy Money I would've gone with Zodiac: Scorpio (36) L Rapper: Lil Wayne (Probably 40+) Cookout Game: Cup/Beer Pong (10-20+?) Dunk on RDC: Dylan (48) Console: Playstation (50-60+)  That's maybe a 200 off rip
Bruh how were they so clueless for the ick round. They were naming relationship issues. An ick is little bit like a pet peeve followed up with slight disgust
sorry ahh production bruh
Bruh ts so rigged how rdc go twice in the fast money round
The back of berleezy’s suit was DRENCHED. LOL😂🤣
10:40 'You said milkshake' is killing me 💀
24:51 😂 the Ben aff daddy jokes been started.
😂lmaoooo definitely ghetto family feud, why is Steve mustache falling off and then why he got a blick, it’s a whole lot going on lmaoooo
IMO L host 😮‍💨
They still aint fix the points, they had a whole break and everything
BRUH WHERE DID GET MARK GET THAT JACKET FROM I NEED TO KNOW !!!!
These people have never seen Family Feud lol
I never seen someone sweat out they shoulders like that🤣🤣🤣🤣
I meant 1:17
Not him hiding a Bebe gun 1:20
Instead of family feuds they should name it friendly fades and just let it be a reoccurring parody bit💞😂
Why berleezy sound like nick cannon 😂
Name a console used to play video games this nigga Mark said Leland 😂😂😂
They cheated on the score i turned this video off so quick
"Is it rigged? Yes it is!" 😂😂😂
13:36 Rage was plotting 💀
This had me really crying laughing and shouting 🤣🤣🤣🤣
37:11 lmaooooo “idk where you at dad” 😂😂😂 I’m sure most of us felt that
Brain rot (amp) Vs authentic comedians (rdc) let’s gooo!!!
FYI this is NOT how you play family feud lol
Me on the first day of 2025:  *_”I guess I’ll just.. watch this shit again 👴🏾”_*
“What do Steve do in this moment?” 😂😂😂 omg
Duke trynna aura farm the whole the show
Annoying asf
BerlEEEEEEEEEEEZZZZZZZYYYYY
The best and funniest family feud ever. 😂😂
These some handsome ass black men😍
bro mark at the end had me gasping for air 🤣
The fact they didn’t know the difference between an ick and just bad relationship things is so funny. And then Duke asking “they like that?!” Like no but it’s not an ick
This host ain’t never seen a full episode of Feud in his damn life 😂
Woooooooah 😮😅
We need more Berleezy x AMP content
Not even a min in and it’s already a mess😭whyd rdc come out with amp
😂😂😂 STEVEEE

8:42 they could’ve said hair
Berleezy sweating thru the jacket is hilarious 😭😭😭😭
I feel like I just watched a tornado for 42 minutes
They is FUNNY ASLLL🤣🤣🤣 how am I just now seeing this!!🤣🤣🤧😊🥲
Ain’t no way I have never seen AMP Berlin and RDC world all three together 😂
“Somebody give me back my head” still hilarious to this day 💀💀💀🤣🤣🤣
This game was so chaotic lmfaaoooo I’m here for every second . 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This why these niggaz winning. They’re creative with the content. AMP AND RDC
THEY never even fixed the score

Walker Jennifer Miller Joseph Martinez Kenneth
Ghetto feud 😂😂😂
the host not knowing how to play the game is annoying
27:37 DYLAN FUNNY AFFF
30:21 WHERE DID HE GO
He said “Aye that’s berleezy!” 💀💀💀
3:09 Mark head really little in this scene 😭
berlin impersonating duke 😂
15:21
10:40 it was when Berleezy said “you said milkshake”, and how he was looking he was looking so serious it took me out.🤣🤣
TOUGHHH
The host didn't kn9w what he was doing. Annoying
Mark such a sore loser… just go back to your side already
Who tf is rdc
RDC are the OG’s when it come to streaming fr 💯
i just KNOW Berleeze Harvey smelled CRAZY by 15 minutes in
I wish amo would have brought out Ray 😭😂
18:40 “exposed buttcrack” got me over here in tears laughing 🤣🤣🤣 who tf was making the answers
Amp do it best 😂😂😂❤
34:32 ts got me weak
Berleezy you gotta give them the number one answer
I like how Leland bullied Kai lol
BERLIN IS SOOOO FUNNY BRO OMGGG
“Mouth breathing, who breathes from the mouth?” 😂😂😂😂😂
Berleezy: Is it rigged.   Mark: (gets answer right) YES IT IS 😭😭😭
Only here for Berlin🤷🏾‍♀️
All that alcohol sweating out of Berleezy 😂
Plan this better smh
RDC baby!!!!!
Fanum saying god did while built like khaled making me think he wanna play him in his biopic
Mark definitely pressed that first question first, I knew it, then I slowed it down to 0.25 speed and it was definitely him
Berleezy is THE best host. Bro funny asf
The way the music dropped as soon as he said “hold up let me get my shit”
Mark got his Sage Naruto robe on
7:41 god did and hell yeah in the same sentence is crazy!
17:14 I knew it cause some of these girls like toxic men 😂
Is there another one of these
This was very entertaining! lolol
Is Berlin big ash or is  everyone else short 😭
I wanna see these niggas fight for real
Your Rage kinda look like cory
Yo Steve talked way to much!
Ayy remember give your lives to Christ because one day he’s gonna come back and I don’t wanna see anyone of you go to hell and repent of your sins so you can everlasting peace with god and Jesus I really hope and pray you accept Jesus in your life as your lord and savior,father,teacher,friend,your mother,your everything please accept in your life because I don’t wanna see any of you go to hell or hear him say “depart from me I never knew you” much love stay blessed may god bless and stay strong 💪🏾
They always fighting 😂
Sweat marks threw a suit is CRAZY 😂😂😂
announcer sounds like nick cannon lmfao
Pt1 was Legendary…..  They acted differently because to many people was in the in the crowd💀
Had to turn my brightness up to see All them
33:14 hxh reference
RDC got plot armor 😂😂 10:57
If I worked for family feud. I'd try to make this happen! Imagine all of them with the real Steve Harvey!
Most chaotic game ever 😂
Steve Harvey was the roach this whole time 😮
9:24 dylan sqaurin up lmaoooooooo
9:22 Why was Dylan bout to Square up in dat bitch
berleezy had phone this one in 😭😭 he was crowdsourcing rhe rules and shit
ima equalize all yall lmfaoooooo
The whole game was rigged AMP had 35 and DMC had 64😂
mark plot armor
Where did the family feud is not how you actually play the game, but it was still entertaining, and when mark was lost it was funny asf
crowd dont sound real
“I got the equalizer I got the equalizer”  “I’ll equalize all y’all”
This was actually peak entertainment.
I know they're all cool, but RDC is so much funnier. They just have way funnier personalities and interactions amongst themselves.
Jesus Christ mark has ADHD lol… I was getting a little irritated lol 😂 good show though
I just noticed that berleezy was the tallest one there
this turned ghetto so fast 😂 turned into a REAL fued!
Nah that last round before fast money was crazy I wouldn't have guess a single one of those I was so confident the answer was ripped/messed up seats
What a mess! UK may be more difficult to get an audience but the quality of the production is far better
This just made me realize that family feud would be more live if they gave Steve Harvey a loaded pistol🤣
Steve harvey being the host was amazing
Imagine dashie here, it would be hilarious💀
I know next time I won't click on any of y'all's videos so unorganized!!! Y'all done lost y'all mind
It's so ghetto LOL LOOOLLL
These boys crazy as hell 😂
FUED
MR POTATO HEAD!!!!   😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ummm, does rdc mean riding sick community…
Why are DC got all those people on sale. They got like eight people.
Whoever at the scoreboard CANNOT do math
They ho’d dem boys 😂😂😂
them 48 people living rent free in dylan's mind 🤣🤣
It’s interesting how Duke, kai, and Fanum are the only amp members that actually wear their chains in public😂
“Who are the 48?! I wanna play everybody that said that!”
7:53 THAT'S WILD LMFAOOO 💀😭😭
Complaining about how the show supposed to be played  and "steve" dont even know what to do next , neither the people who wanted to bring amp out and cheat them and look a mess while playing the game.
This shit was terrible
"Name a console you played"  Mark: "Leland!"
Why Mark dressed like Full Ghetto Alchemist???
Family Fued Hood edition
This was funny as hell !!
It is rigged 😂😂😂 the fact that AMP should’ve gotten the points for the 2nd round haha
The host sounds like Nick Cannon
Amp is better👍😎
THE MUSTACHE BRUHHHH
lee manhandeling tf outta kai givin him the ben treatment @30:11 had me on the floor
this so ghetto  nd they didnt give amp they points
RDC had almost all AMP points that’s rigged
Legendary
39:04  "name a console you use to play games"  "leland"   💀💀💀💀
Dylan who on RDC can you dunk on? Ben😂😂😂
Dude it would be legendary to have RDC vs AMP on Steve Harvey's Family Feud. That HAS to happen at least once in my lifetime, a very deadly combination of comedy😂😂
Duke: they like that? 🤣
27:30 Lmao Dylan too gangsta for this shit. 🤣🤣
Bro had to get the strap 5 minutes into da show 😂
I felt personally attacked when he said most hated sign is a scorpio 😭
Bro he sweat through 3 layers of suit 😂. I was there but I missed this event this the first time I’ve seen it. The whole Dreamcon was lit and I’m going back again this year already got my ticket
Berleezy getting COOKED by both sides man I feel for him 😂
we need cory in one of these
Him using the water gun as a gun is crazy 😂😂
the end with mark was so wholesome idk 😭 this was so chaotic shout out berleezy
Who is RDC?
BERLIN IS SO FUNNT BRO
39:04
The big Family Fued sign doing the harlem shake
AMP don’t know what an ick is 😭😭
Would’ve been even funnier with starved Harvey and y’all definitely could’ve afford that
436 points to 0 thats crazy lol
Berleezy was off a MOLLY, dat boi was SWEATING
The way the main RDC guys skipped the short dude in the beginning during the handshakes was crazy lmaoo😅
THE GIRLS SCREAMING FOR DUKE- 13:19
Berleezy a comedian😭😭😭 give ‘em stand up !
I’ll never get over them saying rdc stands for run duke coming 😂
These gotta be the worst answers
Its wild that so many guys don't know what "The ick" means. The ick is something small that a guy can do that will produce a feeling of disgust so exposed butt crack, being broke, boogers, a weird laugh, the way he eats, walking funny etc makes sense. Bad communication, being a player, etc are bigger and more like red flags to not proceed with a relationship with a guy. Ick means something small producing a feeling of disgust.
11:00 had me dying
Who ever was working the scoreboard should be fired lmao
IT'S YOUR HOST, WITH THE ROAST...
Steve 😅hot af lol !!! Sheshhhh
Welcome back!! #Eezzyy Gang
I wish this wasn't so obviously scripted, woulda done a lot better
Low budget production
This shit funny af I wish this was the real show the🪳 dude and Dylan made this
10:48 “We not doin this no no, cause i got the equaliser”😂😂😂
God did... Hell yeah😂😂
lmao dylan was upfront n center. ready to scrap
What even is AMP  bunch of wannabe gangsters trying hard to be like RDC and Sidemen
Berleezy did his thing 😂
What’s the family feud theme they used called? Like what year was it from? Who is it by?
11:35 Matress & Blunt Is Crazy .
(inaudible) "To make it even, amp should have yourrage on their team"
Ngl I miss this shit 😂
its the way berleezy just refuses to open his water bottle knowing good and well he need that
If u at the intro skip to the ending and it look like someone dumped water on berleezy 😂😂😂
Steve upping the pole is crazy
You can tell none of the people up there have watched a full episode of family fued. 😂
Bro Berleezy the real MVP sweatin through the suit🤣🤣🤣🤣
12:16 I swear Dylan and Agent have the same amount of melatonin in their skin bro
Berlin's back just gradually getting more and more soaked every time he turns around has me rolling.
Berleezy: is it rigged?! *ding* Mark: Yes it is! 😂😂😂
Why did Desmond skip over there when they won round 3 😂
37:29 wholesome moment fr😭😭
24:50 “this boy said a broken damn car, DONT YOU NEED A CAR ???” that shi was hilarious 😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Big DYL really in this shi. How did he know about dominos being played 😭?
This vid as dry and my thanksgiving turkey no kap
This ain’t copyright infringement?
Who tf is RDC 😂lol ??? It doesn’t matter let’s go AMP💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Agree with kima and as my first time at dreamcon and WORKED AT SDCC 2022 https://www.tumblr.com/terranova57821/736626308284661760/dreamcon-review-2023-black-twitter-personified-my?source=share  They really didn’t try to focus on accommodating new attendees felt it was a whole clout chasing partycon where it relays too much on a straight celeb demographic and overrated series knowing it would sell also the after party music would play the same music genre with all that cussing just to tend that audience and that goes to there highest content creators felt as if everyone had to wait for them AND THERE non existence  lgbt demographic  DREAMCON edit yourselves when there 2 days and the cosplays tend to rely on overrated characters and have goodie bags for con goers like SDCC which will be on the same week 2024 so a hot mess waitING to happen #EDITYOURSELFDREAMCON 3/5 EVENT
we not gonna talk about how he spelt feud wrong ?? (joke)
My bearleezy got the wutang sweat sign on his back
I thought the host was duke...
No 🧢 the first one they did was way better than this one, and they didn’t even have all the production that they had in this one.
no way he said SEGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA im dying
DEFINITELY RIGGED 😂
They need to fire whoever was in charge of the screen 😂
steve kinda look and sound like nick cannon 😂
AMP never got their points 😭
NAH I NEED A STREAM WITH BERLIN RDC AND AMP AND CALEBCITY
Amp vs beta squad
My favourite parts were def Mark talking about some Sega, Dylan's cockiness, and The chaos of them going back and forth offstage. Also those round 2 points were never RDCs so the grand total was wrong the whole time 🤣
they asking the crowd how the game go
“ARE WE HACKED” 😂😂😂 37:04
28:51
kai and berleezy being a sagittarius this whole video is everything 2 me
9:26 Dylan standing on business

They do not know what qualifies as an “ick” lmaoo😂😂😂
Berleezy got wings!
Agent bro please fix that cringe personality bro its kinda got me thinking
I'm genuinely upset that AMP lost AGAIN... They didn't have a fair opportunity. 3 rounds, then they won the 2nd one. TF kinda Family Fued game is this?!! NO!!!

SEGA IS CRAZY 😭😭😭😭😭😭
11:05 hair is on people just like how amp previous answer was booty. Amp being sore losers again
Berleez a goat, rdc just keeps winning
AMP being sore losers 😂
Duke reminds me of future how he talks 😅😅
What kinda jacket is mark wearing a choir cloth

Berlin being taller than duke shook me for some reason lmaooo
Sooo ghetto😂😂😂
marc hit that shit first
Ts being rigged made it even funnier😂

Milkshakes⁉️
Niggas not knowing how the real show is played out was killing me cause I’m an AVID watcher lmao
I love berleezy smmm bruh he was perfect 😂😂😂
Amp got the drip for sure they win this battle on that
Yall should make a video with thesefoos!!

12:20 talk
12:20 talk
12:20 talk
“oh a console you play games on I couldn’t hear that’s not fair… SEGA!” 🤣
Love to see brothas still hating to lose. Not enough of that these days.
Sega nigga…SEGAAAA?!? 😂
THE WAY AGENT SAID HEYYY 😢😜😜😜😝😝
Berkeley’s sound lie nick canon 😭😭
Damn they didn’t grow up watching family feud?
“Thick than den “ 😂😂

Berleezy sweating through that suit is wilddddd
GOLD
Buddy whole back wet
Def rigged
Desmond so aggressive 😂
Bro this is everything I didn’t know I needed
This gave me a stroke

32:04 Had to pause this part and stop myself from laughing and shedding tears cause WTF???
"How yall doing my niggas and nigga-rinas" Chris is meee😂😂😂😂😂
rage look like he bout to tackle  steve
They missed the chance to call this           “Family Hood “ . 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I got the equalizer 🔫🤣
those were all solid answers for the questions more on point then the real family fued except for the ick girl one
i feel like undergarments like bra,underwear etc wouldve been a better answer than vomit
Rdc is the definition of plot armor😂
Texas VS New York This ends the same every time 😂
Damn I remember when I found Berleezy from his _Hey Arnold!_ roast
Shit was ate up
They were naming red flags and not icks🤣
So many black allstars, my ppl stayyy winning
ain’t that mf in jail
why rage dressed like a delinquent 💀
For the ick one they kept getting it wrong because they wasn’t naming icks, they was just naming things girls don’t like when talking to a guy. Bad communication is not an ick 😭
The cool kids vs the cool geeks 😂
Mark in his coat lol
It's honestly how the bald cap keeps rising up every 5 minutes lololol🤣
It's RAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGEEEE
THESE NIGGAS ARE WALKING HEROES. EVER SINGLE ONE. NOT ONE LEFT OUT
"Is it rigged??"😂😂😂😂 took me out
ouuuuuu kai ptsooooo
15:19 why bro have to exaggerate like that😂
He dressed like Steve Harvey but he sound like Nick Cannon 😭😂😂😂

Kai look like dookie
and like this if they wayyyyy overusing the goooooddddd didddddddd phrase.. too much
how could they not fix the score when they should have got that 40 some points on second round
Berleezy being the host is the most perfect idea ever😂😂💕
Once again mark shows his plot armor 😂
Next thing yk half these mfs locked up from the nyc thing
Not then planning this whole family feud and half of them don’t know how to play 😂
This was actually very entertaining. And also the most ghetto family feud I’ve ever seen
Not Berlin sweating through three layers of clothing… the undershirt, shirt, and blazer. Crazy! They got them lights shining on bru 😂
this game was so chaotic but i enjoyed every second lmaoo
New year and that mustache is till Berlin’s biggest opp
Nigga in the red robe is screaming for attention holy fuck
How did RDC get to 109 points when they got the question wrong AMP was supposed to get those points..💀
Why at 30:17 berleezy really looked like Steve Harvey 😂😂
When Agent said “who are we surveying” I almost fell out my bed 😂
Y’all got Berlin running around like he not 30 💀
Whoever was working the scoreboard was selling
Family fued
I know he was hot as a mf in that suit 😂
I'm glad they pointed out how weird the answers one cause that "give girls the ick" one had bad answers
30:52
“he said he wouldn’t wanna see a beat up car like he wasn’t the one asking for a ride” 💀
Bro this the Ghetto Feud 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Berleezy might the funniest man alive I swear!
v bjn
32:08 💀💀  👺: I DID THAT 😇: Gentlemen if you don’t mind
Scorpio? Never heard that  I always hear Gemini  Never heard people hating Scorpios  They lit af to me
embarrassing these dudes didn’t take 5 mins out their time to actually see how the games works instead of a running an absolute sh*t show
How do RDC have 109 y’all stay cheating
that's real motion when fanum said "God Did" and tha crowd responded 😂💯
13:40 LMAOOOO
48 is disrespectful
Leland! Sega! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
4:42 5:34 8:53 13:38 LMFAOOOOOOO 15:18 18:31
Hell nah g This what we needed
Free kai
why is the quality 720 only
I don’t know AMP as a whole but this was funny to watch
I love how agent just casually gave berleezy the most friendliest handshake in human history
I didn’t know Ray J, Quavo and Nav was in a content house
Greatest rivalry ever!!!!!!!!!😂
This production is complete booty
Production is ass
This was funny 😓  Points going to wrong side  Unsure of rules 🤦‍♀️
#WhoopiGoldberg No one calling for all these people to be canceled?  This was way more racist than "Try That in a Small Town".
“Are you hatin on workin people?!” 💀💀
Shorty who brought Berlezzy his rag was HAVIN back there 11:22
Rdc be cheating
Berleezy's hosting and acting skills are noticed. He's pretty dope wit Dem ones👌🏿

RDC didn’t even wait for their intro  They just walked out right after AMP😭🤣😂
"200!?"
FREE AMP
Mark heard video games and console and immediately said Leland. Leland the certified goat of games 😂😂🎉
Duke and Kai be on everything 😂😂🔥
29:25 he said I’m sorry bro to Duke like he knows it was rigged letting them know he’s sorry tf that was stupid af someone told them all the answers or someone has an ear piece in or the dude putting stuff on the board just types it in whatever the say so wack bruh 🤦‍♂️
Not even 2 min in and berleezy grabbed the strap
It was nice seeing them work through the troubles, gave it its own personality and not just cookie cutter family feud.   Berlezy did a good job as Steve, loved his energy
Where’s the rdc world cypher
5:36 yuhhhh😂😂
This was the sloppiest game of family fued i ever seen...😂
Leo is the most hated zodiac sign fasho

Nah Mark unlocked his shonen protagonist plot armor in dreamcon 🤣
Berlinnnnnnnn
SEGA is hilariousssssss.
The poor attempt at the bald cap and mustache is absolutely hilarious in itself 😂 y’all are too funny for this. It’s like watching typical family game night in a black household
This the most unprofessional, poorly produced set of family feud I ever seen smh
I got the equalizer… then  proceeds to run away 😂😂😂
I don't know where you at Dad~ Every black kid 💀

Bruh rage’s energy was off he didn’t wanna be there😂😂😂
40:56 💀
The fact Berleezy sweating through the back of his suit halfway through the game has me weak 😂
they wasnt playing when they said family "feud"
Ion really like the way it went. Could've done without the ignorant stuff for me
Sega?!???😂😂😂😂
This shit was hilarious I wonder if Steve seen any of these

Steve slowly shapeshifting into berleezy was hilarious
Any mean possible

Again, THIS HELLA GHETTO 😹🤣
Bro I was crying when steve leezy pull out the nerf gun😂
This hella ghetto. Kai was suppose to go again lmfaoo
i had no idea he was that tall
Berleezy killed this hosting!!
They scuffed the whole show 😅  The winner of the first round just gets a advantage to be the first to answer the fast money round.  It's supposed to still be RDC vs AMP but since RDC won they get to go first.  They just did RDC vs RDC in the end, that's not how it works 😅😅
berleezy as host and amp in this, yk it’s fihnna be fire 🔥
This was so ghetto and I enjoyed every single bit of it! 😂😂😂
21:59 Mario and Luigi
I’m suprised fanum didn’t say burger on the first question
not one person onnat stage actually watched more than one episode of family feud cuz how no one know how the game work💀
Fanum Said “milkshakes” 😂😂
This shit was so damn trash 😂😂
Berlin didn’t watch ONE eps of FF before this 😭😭 he ate tho
That suit has Berlin sweating like a bih 😂😂😂💀💀💀 nigga was stressed up there
Jon looked at the answers and gave them up . Should be disqualified
“Matter fact, let me see y’all just shake hands bro! Good sportsmanship! Good sportsman— wait lemme get my shit!” BERLIN DAMN FUNNY ASF
18:45 how rdc get the points ??
this nig Berlín act like he need a hug fr, like u gud luv? lol

"Who was the 48 that said that, i want to play everybody who said that" bro dylan on yhe spot comedy is hilarious

Berleezy pulled out the gun😂😂😂”ima see you round 2” 😭😭
They really played them niggas on the low
For the Uber questions they should’ve put bugs up there I would not want to see bugs in my Uber
No way they gave RDC those points even when AMP won them

So women okay with bad breath or yellow teeth
Steve ain't never watched family feud. No clue how to host
Bro who let quavo into family feud
Berlin was literally born for this role
Berleezzyyyyy😩😩❤️❤️❤️❤️
the most scuffed game of family feud ive ever watched oh my lord😭
Of course Fanum said milkshake
W family fued😭
This just proves men don’t really know what icks are lol
I like how dude said vomit and it was directly vomit
that mustache hanging on for dear LIFE
When leland and kai smiles at each other LOL just melted my heart <3
9:16 😂😂😂Why the music cut on while everybody was going offf
I wish I could’ve got them dap ups 😢
If you guys dont include Dashie with this then i dont know what you guys are doing
How y’all playing family feud but don’t know the rules of the game 😭😂
Ghetto ahh family feud 😂
aiyooo whattt??
Ain’t none of y’all peep that rdc ain’t get the steal right and they still gave them the points at the end of the round 2 instead of amp 😂😂😂
I actually thought the thumbnail was Steve Harvey 💀
Black people act like they never know what's going on half the time, then get mad when people call us gorillas lmao. I feel for Berleezy, it's like he's trying to play a game with toddlers lol
These niggas ignorant as hell, and I love all of them for it lmao
Next year, y'all need a 5 second time limit on answering
34:30 😂
It's official, I'm definitely going to Dream Con next year.
They don't know family fued or something???😂😂😂
This the best thing my eyes have ever been blessed with watching
I love when we have fun together 💪🏿💪🏿
Funny how white content houses never stay together.. black brotherhood is a bond that last ❤
I don't think they understand what an ick is lol. They're describing nonnegotiables in a relationship when an ick can be as simple as seeing how goofy someone runs.
It wouldve been funny if jidion was the host but Berleezy is insane to
That boy Berleezy was sweating 😂😂😂
rage like that one side character that pop out randomly that people love
Yourage lmao saw him reacting to sidemen 20 vs 1 deji edition
Name a game system!  Mark: Lealand!

35:02 BERLEEZY SWEATING SO DAMN MUCH ITS KILLIN ME💀💀
Damn I thought the host sucked
“This nigga said a broken down car, DONT YOU NEED A RIDE” 😭😭😭

Mark is annoying
You know this a family show right ? My niece in the crowd.       Lemy see that BOoooodey

BERLIN WITH THE STICK
"I wouldn't want to see a stranger in my Uber" It's crazy how shared Uber rides are a thing of the past now lol
Lol just wondering who else just completely changed videos after AMP left the stage
I DID THAT 😂
Yourrage in amp would be crazy
Kai short ass looking like lil uzi
This family feud so bootleg
Sooooo yall re using ideas??

Dylan salty as fuck at the end
Berlin sweating like a pastor in church 😂
Berleezy sweat looks like wings
Bruh said sega 😂
Berleezy tall asf 😂
It’s like these mofos never seen family feud before
They never fully watched a single episode of Family Feud & it shows 😂 and this man said Sega....sir....PlayStation was right there 😂. Dylan said Logic, Mark said Lil Uzi. Lil Wayne & Lil Baby definitely should've been top 2 answers 😂
what dude say in the background 15:52
Berlin killed it as the host lmao!
Amp vs beta squad would slap
9:25 Dylan posted up like a true nigga 😂😂
berleezy musta been hella hot lolol
Bro said milkshakes instead burgers
32 Minutes in and I realized AMP didn't go once xD Agent talking smack in the begining about last time, then gets violated 2nd time around.
16:36 it may give them the ick but broke boys still be pulling
Not trying to instigate, but is there a slight tension between amp and rdc or is it just me? I noticed it after amp lost and got into a small (but friendly) scrap with rdc at 30:08.(if it's just me guys let me know, I'm fine with constructive criticism)
24:40 I was laughing too hard man 😭
25:05 "This man said a broken down car like he aint the one asking for the ride"😂😂
Lol is he sweating through the suit??

Woke 😒😒😒😒😒

Berleezy look like he did a 5k run at the end 😂😂😂
EUGHHHHHHH

"is this rigged" - berleezy  *Answer is correct*
I’m convinced nobody has watched an episode of family feud where neither team “play or passed”
How come clowns don't wear make up and red noses anymore?
I wish they had a bigger budget for this show.
Once again I just was not expecting rage to come out of nowhere
@15:19
I forget these people be on the same planet sometimes
berlin sweating thru the suit that’s bad 4 business
😂😂😂😂😂
Lol the answers on give the girls the ick...
Im crying, they really need to watch the real show but loved the content
Ayo bro who let NAV on the show? First brown boy to get it poppin’ Fr Fr 🔥 love to see it Maine
Why they always play it. Pass it and let them run it up so you can steal

Ngl the host was HILARIOUS 😂😂😂
That fucking mustache got me fucking crying
39:52 mark walks off stage😂😂
This nigga berleezy big af 😂
I love this shit. fr
this man sweated so much by the end of it you can see his hair through his bald cap 🥲
AMP can win in basketball, as long as RDC win everything else 🤣🤣🤣
they forgot what an ick is loool
Omg, this ghetto as hell 😂
Y’all gotta actually get Steve for the next family feud that would be legendary
Berleezy's run after he backed out the equalizer 😂😂
Dissing somebody wheels when you need an Uber is crazy 😭😭
Ik he hot in that suit, sweating out the mustache

They kinda robbed Kai from the pillow answer 😂😂 it coulda been “Mattress/Pillow”
Going to my first Dreamcon, this was a moment for the books. Bruh, how did nobody realize that they never gave AMP points for that second round🤣. Dylan got the question wrong, so the points supposed to go to the other team. Regardless this weekend was crazy. Im def running it back next year. Berleezy need to host another one off top
Ain’t even watch the first one I’ll prolly spin back later but Berleezy as the Host is goated 💪🏾‼️💯
3:38 berlin mustache falling off got me crying 😂
Lemme come over there and call cues for you guys since y’all AV team struggling 😂😂😂

Yrg was asked by RDC to be on stages, they wanted him to be included  💛
i like how he gets annoyed by dylan asking him if he’s seen family fued but then proceeds to continue asking the audience how to play 😭
they don’t understand what an “ick” is that’s why they didn’t do good lmaooo first thing i said was “if his buttcrack showing” LMAOO
19:04 is straight out of a movie😂
Whos AMP?
AMP is basically the hood version of RDCWorld1 from the multiverse 😭😂😂😂
That bih said let me get my shit just in case they start fighting 😭😂😂😂
“ I’m about to get the gun again please just say sorry bruh “ 😭😂😂😂
Berlin as Steve was perfect AF😂😂💪🏾

at 28:31 you could hear ray say “god did” 😂😂😂
I love the videos but instead of saying God say Got damn because your using Gods name in vain. But love the videos keep doing what y’all doing and God loves you❤
Ain’t nobody watched family feud before?!

The crowd is screaming spades and mark just says dominoes. The crowd just helping this nigga
BERLEESTEEVE
Yo the host is FUNNY AS FUCK OMFG

BERLEEZY is a better Steve Harvey than Thanos 😂
I think the confused red flags with getting grossed the answer made alot of sense
Shit better than actual family fued
RDC has plot armor like a mf but I’m here for it ngl 😂
Berleez with the piece😂🔫
Mark came in clutch on fast money
32:24 ✌🏽😀✌🏽
Ghetto Feud just needs to solve the technical difficulties and its an SSS+ show.
man they hoed big dyl he's the third best in rdc after mark and ippi in basket ball and almost half the audience voted dyl is the easiest to be dunked on. thats mad disrespectful.

"This is a family show my niece is in the crowd"    "Let me see that booty"!
That game was super rigged!! They bent so many rules and protocols of how the game is played. And all that fighting is fake too.
My boy is about to faint in that suit

w vid
Berleezy 😂🥹
They done really brought out YourRage so the whole AMP squad gets whooped🤣
this was all over the place bro☠️
The fact that those 40 points went to RDC proves this shit might really be rigged
Bro imagine RDC, AMP, Somebros, and Cory all together in one video. That would go FIIIIRE. Solely based off of this video and every other crossovers they been having
Berleezy helped lead an entire era of YT humor
This nicca mark really out here in Edward's cloak lmao, looking clean though.
That suit is finished
I don’t like watching stuff Duke done win in 🤣🤣 So L gameshow
y does Berleezy look so tall🤣
The fact that lil Wayne didn’t immediately pop into Dylan or marks head for rappers that start with L is so sad.
the way he grabbed the nerf gun brh hn 😭😭
i lovethis mayne. gr8 to see yall collaborating  & building together.
The disrespect on logic😭
Berlin with the mustache is just killing me 😂😂😂
God did amen in Jesus name amen
Dylan is disgusted that 48 people wanna dunk on him
They always gon scrap bout 6x each meet up😂😂
Berleezy an incredible host man, that man got more charisma than anyone on the stage. Incredible
37:20 nah this is goated

This shit is hilarious and bootleg at the same time 😂
Anyone else turn it off wen AMP lost.. RDC is kinda wack forreal.. AMP funny as hell tho
Host should have been coryxkenshin to balance out the pure niggerdom goin on here. He definitely would have at least did some research. How you gonna not know  how the the damn game works as the host?😂
9:25 Dylan was ready to swing on sum 💀
Family feud needs to seriously consider berleezy when Steve Harvey retires
Every single one of these Nigga’s lmao is high lol

I never seen any Berleezy content I am now a fan buddy had me dead lol
*freaky fued*

I'm convinced nobody on that stage has seen Family feud🤣🤣🤣
Dylan: *WHO SAID THAT!? 48 PEOPLE SAID THAT!?...I WANNA PLAY THE 48 PEOPLE WHO SAID THAT!* 💀💀💀💀
I Watched this when they streamed it live on twitch…. my favorite part is still “SEGA” 😭😂
Imagine if dashiegames was a part of this or even the host 😂😂
We need more RDC X AMP videos

Bro these niggas have never watched family feud😭😭😭I’m crying
I laughed the entire time. This was fantastic.
This shit was funny as hell 😂
This stream was funny asf glad yall posted it wish i was there 😂
“I wanna play everybody that said that” Dylan saying it like he’s not the smallest in rdc 😂
Instead of the host looking like Steve Harvey he look more like The RZA😂😂😂
Next year I’m Going. I just started work so I could Not go
THERE GO BERLIN IN THE GAME
29:33 Instant hood Reflex
I do not know yamp played every one of those questions they should have past. Just Family Feud number one the weirder or more specific or more options that are on the board would bore you to be passing
Wtf is sega lmaoooo
Ayyyyyyyyyyyyy 29:06
Mark got that luffy energy frfr 😂😂😂
I swear nobody up on that stage ever watched a episode of Family Feud
Seeing it live was hilarious, but it’s even more funny watching it back cause you see stuff you might not have noticed 😭 Mark is such a shounen protagonist it’s crazy 🤣
Steve got it on him like Cash Money Des
21:19 fact that this was NOT on the board is insane
That was Berleezy not Steve Harvey!? This bogus
Back of Berleezy suit lookn like The Mothman Prophecies 😅
Berlin really having a Tsunami in that brown suit 😂
Lol God did then hell yeah after cmon on 😂 I'm sorry no disrespect he clearly don't care
Niggas need to rehearse the basics next time😂😂😂 and Berleezy soaking through that suit up there where the fans at😂
GOD DID !!!!!
That man berleezy is drenched up there 😂
berleezy is mad tall duke is 6"4 and taller than him
40:49 Ludacris is the number 1 answer
This shit ghetto 😂😂😂😂
Berleezy had to be host, nobody else could of did it better
Berleezy was sweating buckets was the AC not on 😭
family who?
10:40 "you said milkshake" 10:53 " i got the equalizer" 😂😂😂😂
Idk beeleezy was that tall.

Most uncoordinated shit I’ve seen in a long time 😂
These are so effing hilarious! I would just add that it would be just a tad better if they all knew the rules lol 😅
lmao berlin running is the funniest thing ever
I still see the roach 😂
Wish dashie appeared at these events, we gotta see him and berlezzy collab
Best Con on Earth 💯💯🔥🔥😤😤😤
bro how is mouth breathing a ick lol
to be honest dylan the shortest. casuals probably answer the questions and aff haven't been in rdc vids in years so they not picking aff over dylan. john is not considered rdc. ben to tall leland to strong mark to nice and des to much of a hot head to get dunked on over dylan. dylan a good shooter with handles but to weak
28:55 you know rage knees screaming
Bruh this shit was so badly put together 😂
Rigged Family Feud😭😭
Man this was too messy
Berleez Harvey
28:50 lmfaoooooo "is it rigged?".....DING
Coming on strong and bragging are def two different things 😂 Coming on strong means trying to hard to make her want you or sleep with you (being too touchy feely or clingy early on). Bragging and flexing is talking about how much money/cars you have etc
Berleezy was a perfect host bro lol
Imma need Leland shirt fr
bro why arent they saying good answer 🤣it woulda been so on point
Another great crossover from RDC!
Dammit, somebody get Berlin a better mustache 😂
ayeeee
21:34 "is that how the show go?" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 coming from the HOST
we know berleezy put blunt up there
Bruh I just realized mark was wearing Dante’s(from Devil May Cry series) trench jacket.  SWAG 😎
Got my wing stop I’m high asf after a long day at work and now I’m watching this video my evening is set eughhhh!!
Somebody make this official
Rdc didn't deserve the win in my opinion
wait the ending score was 175 how did they win ?
The 109 is crazy
10:55 "Imma equalize all y'all" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Good sportsmanship…nope let me get my shit 🔫😭😭💀
21:28 Berleezy asking what Steve would do got me 🤣🤣😂
LEEZY looks crazy!! This is BLACK EXCELLENCE! Dyl included!!
dem mfs said god did at tha sametime
dis shit riggged asf
“Don’t you need a ride?!” Got me 😂
Fanum be spamming “God Did” like he didn’t steal it from dj Khalid.
"Name a console used to play video games" "LELAND!"
Lmao this is so ghetto and I love it 😂
If Berleezy mustache ain't falling off ion want it! This was epic 😂
Nice  love  it 😂🤣
RDC still can’t compete with y’all in sports
Crazy how far berlin made it. Went to the same highschool as him loool.
this like when god came down to rescue his child
Rubber dubber got me 😂
this is not how u play family feud
I be forgetting Berlin bout tall asf
First, THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH RDC for allowing those of us that couldn't make it to DreamCon this year to watch it on Twitch live!!! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!! 😭🥰🙏🏾🤗🤗🤗 Second, GOD BLESS Berleezy for wearing that HOT SUIT (he was sweating through) & WIG CAP for Family Feud!!! 🥵🥵🥵 I pray he THOROUGHLY HYDRATED 💦 afterwards! 🫂🙏🏾
YRG might as come over to AMP
ICONIC TO SEE THIS LIVE LMFAO
Question for the viewers so you get inna Uber and see a wood chillin you not gonna spark? Or you see some drank you not gonna take a shot🤨
Family what?
Ayo did he lowkey square up at 9:28?! 😂
"SEGA" + 2 mins... I had to hold the shit in b/c I'm at work 😆
This is the exact standard of a video title and thumbnail that requires an immediate like button click. Before you hear anything. Before you hear Berleezy introduce somebody. INSTANT LIKE!!
It ain’t an official dreamcon family feud unless berleezy hosting 😂
Berleezy sweating harder then a pastor in that suit 😂😂
They boys won everything at their own event 😂
This ghetto ass family feud 😂😂😂
This really is just RDC and AMP feud. Ain't no family here
11:13 they slow😂 person as in thicker people
*Feud, fellas.
This is MF hilarious
24:41 Aff is so sorry 😂😂😂
Berlin was SWEATING in that suit
Mark really was gonna sell with that SAGA shit lol
Kai not even that funny fr.
Glad AMP videos back
RDC don't get enough credit they been doin this for yearsand they only got one million subscribers
BERLIN DID HIS THING
Whoever controls the scoreboard needs to be fired
Niggas had a bunch of technical difficulties 😭 man y’all did y’all thang. Definitely gotta attend dreamcon next year
Bro i love this it’s such a happy vibe bro I hope to become a big creator like them one day 😭

This was funny asl. AMP GOT HOE'D 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 #JusticeForAMP
Nigga said Sega and geminis are the most hated FACTS
This shit was so janky it was funny😂😂

10:52 i got the equalizer 😭😭
I ain’t even seen the video and this is a goat video already
That was straight fire. Good shit y’all

Dylan was like,"Come dunk on me bitch!" 😂😂😂😂😂
24:53 Berlin got a point. You can’t complain about a beat up car if you don’t even have one yourself💀💀
Why’d you let em say that?😂😂😂 Dylan funny af
the most poorly-organized family fued ive seen. and yet still the funniest 😂😂
ts always so disorganized mane😂
😂😂😂
ngl rdc is bad im here for amp
*Nobody asked but here are some of the timestamps for a few of Berleezy’s funny moments during the panel:* - 1:17 Berlin putting the Mousekatool on the podium just in case he has to air out the spot & checking to see if anyone peeped lol - 2:50 Berlin telling Mark to be patient & let him host  - 3:43 Berlin telling Davis chill out with the cheeks talk cause his niece(Brazil) in the crowd - 4:10 Berlin threatening to ensure Mark meets *“the Woo”* if he doesn’t let him host his show - 9:21 Berlin grabbing the toolie fully prepared to turn the stage into Chiraq since AMP tried to jump him - 10:52 Berlin once again threatening to up the score with that Nerf with a switch to dissolve the conflict  - 30:19 Kai takes buddy’s bald cap off lol - 31:04 Gets confirmation from the audience and attempts to one shot Kai almost leaving Mr. Cenat on 2HP

Who says vomit?? That fosure rigged

I have never seen anyone sweat through the suit jacket.
The show being “rigged” is even more funny haha
You can't tell how suuuper echo-y it is in there, that's why the fast money round was off haha
shout out berlin man💛 i know he lost a good 10 pounds sweating that suit out for our entertainment😭😭

For the love of Jesus! Please yall go home and marathon Family Feud!😂

34:30  😭😭😭
greatest content creators of our time 💯
RDC I started off watching you guys but all imma say is it’s more like Mark and Friends at this point

Berlin in the very beginning, sounding like Nick Cannon
CAP dylan need a new hair cut!! That FRIAR Cut aka THE HECTOR aka THE CUH cut  is played out!  LOL!
Aye, y’all spelled Feud wrong.
RDC x AMP never miss when it comes to comedy, berleezy is the best host too
Mark and Berleezy reaction at 19:00-19:10 was funny asl 😭💀
mark was in a daze with that fast money😭
“This man said broken down car 😐… dont you need a ride 🤨?”
ayo Steve said give me back my head lol
This video explains to the young ones that watching this is this is why we need videos to be scripted. Sure, it's fun to watch them go at it. But things can go real south if they weren't careful
Yooo dream con was EVERYTHING !! Cant wait to go back next year !!

🤨🤨38:40 I'm extremely shocked that mark or dylan didnt have lil wayne on their mind when they heard the rapper question...Either they were nervous or they're not a fan of lil wayne.
I would want to see something like America Says.
Berleezy as a host was the best decision of all time
God did!😂
Berleezy , amp and rdc in ine video 😭

This was mad funny. Dylan was heated as a bitch at the end that 48 people voted Mark would dunk on him 💀
this was too funny but they need someone to fund their event for the tech and teach them how to play the game without asking the audience but this still a 10/10, rip Dylan too, "name a gaming console people plays? LELAND" lmao
Good vid guys 👍🏻

The sweat stain on berleezy back gradually got bigger and bigger the longer he was on that stage 🤣💀
Berleezy being the host was the BEST decision they could've made.
