Iam so happy over the remarks. I was expecting to see negative remarks because is the norm on here. Congrats to a beautiful couple. Jeezy brought something out of her that her ex husband didn’t , so he need to keep his opinion to himself.

Y’all so mad and can stay mad 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 ahhhhh he chose who he wanted ! He didn’t want no black woman 🤷🏽‍♀️ get over it ! And I’m black saying this soooo yea 😂 sometimes black women really make me not like being black . Y’all hate this lady so much for no reason and just can’t stand seeing a black man with another race . Get some damn therapy . Black men don’t have to be with a black woman if they don’t want to .
Who is cutting onions, god I am crying but happy tears, congrats.
What happened to Tamera ??
The way Jeanie looks at Jeezy
She looks at him like a snack. 😍 Love their love 😍

DAMN IF ONLY KEYSIA COLE 😱COULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS VERSION OF YOUNG JOC 💯 I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT HE DID NOT GIVE A BLACK WOMAN THIS SAME TREATMENT OF RESPECT AND LOVE HE DOGGED KEYSIA OUT AND SHE EVEN PROPOSED😱💯WOW HOW THINGS WITH CHANGE WHEN RACE IS INVOLVED. I WONDER DID HIS OTHER EX'S HAVE A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE?? BET NOT💯AT ALL.
I think it’s a boy too.
One of them said "Young Jeezy...Tryna take it eeaazzaayyy".... in Akon voice..🤣🤣🤣🤣 but I'm happy for them...she lucked up...she got "changed" Jeezy..and he's just sooo amazing to her.. it's always beautiful to see a man as a King..that title has to be earned and I think he definitely earned it..I pray their marriage lasts..because I can definitely tell they're in it for the long haul...may Jeanie Mai continue to have a healthy pregnancy and may she have an exceptionally healthy birth🤲🏽💙..and may God continue to bless their marriage 🥰
SO SWEET!
Jeannie is sooo beautiful.
💖🥰😭😭😭 beautiful
I don’t trust his ass 😭idk why .. it just seems like he takes control of the relationship & she just follows him thinking that’s the role of a woman. Idk I wish them the best though I know that baby is about to be cute!
I just knew Jeannie would get pregnant with Jeesy
Love how she said it was Gods timing ❤️😇
I'm getting sick of them 2
I live them together! I didn’t know he had a daughter,just a son.

A lovely couple.  Love Jeannie and Jeezy. Jeezy is awesome.  So respectful, smart, intelligent, business wise and handsome man. Jeannie a breath of fresh air, intelligent, smart, classy and beautiful.  Well MaMa Mai is so beautiful, so we see where Jeannie got her beauty.
Whey Jenny looks uncomfortable on the dress though, she should’ve wear something comfortable
They just don't go together....
I'm sooo happy mannnn! I'm crying
These comments are sending me bro 🥴😩🤣 When do bw ever see Becky, Maria, or Ling giving this much support or praise when bw date a man from one of their races. Black women do better fr…. Im not saying don’t be happy for people, but omg it’s sad.
I am so happy for Jeezy and Jeannie they will be great parents and she's right he's a true king and "real" man.
Their happiness bring me so much joy. God bless them ❤️🙏🏼

I'M NOT CRYING
The World's top 10 Funniest One Liners   1. Be nice to your kids. They'll choose your nursing home. 2. If at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried. 3. I just let my mind wander, and it didn't come back. 4. Don't steal. The government hates competition. 5. I'm out of bed and dressed. What more do you want? 6. I used to think I was indecisive, but now I'm not too sure.  7. It's bad luck to be superstitious. 8. According to my best recollection, I don't remember. 9. Corduroy pillows: They're making headlines! 10. Gravity: It's not just a good idea, it's the LAW!  Probably the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
Jeezy will cheat on Jeannie like he did on the rest of 'em
I’m so happy for the both of you. Y’all sound , look  so  happy. God bless you in this new journey in life💙

WHY is he wearing sunglasses inside 😆
"Jesus Return" I had a dream about Jesus's return, I was in my bed and I was praying. After my prayer, a bright light came brighter than the sun itself it shined like diamonds, and stars with it came forth a being with bronze and gold amour bringing a sense of peace and love holding a flaming sword and within the sword a burning heat came from it. And the person being Jesus grabbed me by the arm and lifted me from my room I was in the sky, and there saw monstrous beings that were gray and tall they were taking those who chose the world over Jesus and as revelation proceeded I was at a balcony talking to an angel, I watched what was happening to those left behind. The angel said, "All the people knew about his return but did not care that he is the Son of God, all they had to do was believe in him and they would have been saved."
They acting like Jezzy don’t already have children.
If the stomach is pointy, it’s a boy
I have so much respect for J. Jeannie is so blessed to have found love. After seeing them and knowing what she has been through, I believe God will send my king in time. Can't wait to welcome your blessing🤗🤗🤗

Congratulations

This was soooo sweet and fun! When Loni said young Jeezzyyyy😂😂😂😍💕💕💕
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Jeezy got dope skin. I wish I had his skin care routine
Amazing couple rite here. Congrats
Jeannie is annoying
a bunch of has beens and randoms acting excited about things.... read a book ladies, you wont learn or gain anything from these frauds.
Congratulations To You Both!!!🤗🤗

"O Non-Arabs and Arabs, certainly the planet of Torment is just around the corner, so where would you escape? And the evidence upon its approaching in the news of the Great Quran is that Coronavirus shall invade the world from where they do not know its animalistic origin since it has not come from animals but a strain of somewhat like a gnat (Ba'ouda) which you do not encompass knowledge about, a challenge from Lord of the worlds so that you may know that you encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills, Exalted is He! And it is of the lesser torment Moreover, there is a wisdom behind this virus which is to initially stop the world's wheel of life including their factories for many months, then Allah Raises the bar of the climatic war causing floods, fragments of sky mountains loaded with lethal hail, tsunamis, and fiery hurricanes to burn forests. Also, volcanoes, earthquakes, and all kinds of Allah's climatic war of the lesser torment short of the greater torment that perhaps you may return to Allah, and I have explained this in detail a long time ago before their occurrence so let us not repeat it." Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yamani 08 - Rabi Awwal - 1443 AH 14 - October - 2021 AD 08:58 am (According to the official time of [Mecca] Mother of towns) ______________________  https://mahdialumma.net/showthread.php?p=362934 6 #بدر_ربيع_الثاني_لكافه_الدول cSMj9o
"Furthermore, the mass lockout in the world due to Corona has made the major countries know that the global warming did not happen because of factories but because of another reason which they hide from the world, and I know that they are guessing blindly that there is a planet approaching the Earth even though they have not seen it directly due to its different colours; to illustrate, white like the sun, red, and black so how are they going to see a planet that is covered with fire that is darker than a new moon, can you see a new moon despite its closeness to the Earth? It is the same case for planet Saqar when it is covered with intense black fire. But they will know about its coming from scientific theories through its effect on all the planets of the solar system, the sun, and the moon. And the sun has caught up with the moon due to the approach of Planet Saqar, so the full moon occurs ahead of its time before the night of the middle of the lunar month as a repetitive warning in the sky of humans but did not cause them any remembrance Moreover, consecutive climatic disasters are going to befall you and I do not think that it will cause you any remembrance as those fools who do not reason, think, nor believe but what NASA announced, ignoring what Allah's caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani has stated of news that are the truest Words of Allah Lord of the worlds, but NASA and others hide this truth from the worlds and NASA the so-called protector of planet Earth from the dangers of the meteors of planetoids will not benefit you, and I swear by Allah they could not protect themselves from the Planetoid of the first Rajefah (quake). Indeed, Allah will target with the Planetoid of torment the United States of America and they would not be able to protect themselves and it will strike in the speed of light in the land behind the Atlantic Ocean in the USA, in line with the Word of Allah the Exalted: {And Our command is but one, like a glance of the eye. (50) And We have already destroyed your kinds, so is there any who will remember? (51) Al-Qamar -Chapter: 54 -Verses: 50-51" Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yamani 08 - Rabi Awwal - 1443 AH 14 - October - 2021 AD 08:58 am (According to the official time of [Mecca] Mother of towns) ______________________   https://mahdialumma.net/showthread.php?p=362934 3 #بدر_ربيع_الثاني_لكافه_الدول zlQjo1
"Perhaps a questioner would like to say: "Yes, Coronavirus has come by the end of 2019 and the whole world has been quarantined at the beginning of 2020, and we said it is a blessing in disguise thinking that Coronavirus has solved the issue of global warming which the Paris climate agreement conference could not find a solution for since it has suspended the work of factories, vehicular traffic, trains, planes and vessels We were also sure it will reduce climate disasters due to the reduction of carbon dioxide exhausts thinking that Coronavirus shall solve a problem which the Paris climate agreement could not ,while it (the agreement) used to call for reducing 50% of these exhausts; however, it was not applied because countries were afraid on their economy to be hit hard but corona came and stopped the carbonic emissions by 100% for many months, and we thought that climate disasters shall be reduced. But we were shocked as the complete opposite happened! Instead of reducing the climate disasters the intensity of the climatic war causing floods and hurricanes has increased all around the world like never before so Coronavirus has destroyed the global warming theory since the Paris climate agreement was not applied ;given that they have agreed upon reducing 50% of factories exhausts, but Coronavirus has reduced them by 100% for many months due to the quarantine and mass lockdown; on the other hand, the intensity of climatic disasters unprecedentedly increased since 2020 till now; hence the global warming theory has failed O Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, your statements about different matters are verified on actual reality, and those who follow them know this as you have been denying and disbelieving in the global warming theory for more than 16 years, and said that the planet of fire, Saqar, is approaching the Earth and affecting it from a distant place and you have written many statements concerning this matter but we still have not believed you and we believed the global warming theory that then has failed! So could you extract from the Great Quran what proofs that virus corona was sent by Allah to verify your fatwa to demolish the global warming theory as it will force us to stop our factories and wheel of carbonic life for many months, then, it raises the intensity of the unprecedented climate war to destroy the global warming theory?" Then, I reply to the questioners and say: you shall find the news in the word of Allah the Exalted: {But those who deny Our signs - We will progressively lead them [to destruction] from where they do not know. (182) And I will give them time. Indeed, my plan is firm. (183) Then do they not give thought? There is in their companion no madness. He is not but a clear warner. (184) Do they not look into the realm of the heavens and the earth and everything that Allah has created and [think] that perhaps their appointed time has come near? So in what statement hereafter will they believe? (185) Whomsoever Allah sends astray, none can guide him; and He lets them wander blindly in their transgressions. (186) Al-Aaraf -Chapter: 7 -Verses:182-186" Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yamani 08 - Rabi Awwal - 1443 AH 14 - October - 2021 AD 08:58 am (According to the official time of [Mecca] Mother of towns) ______________________  https://mahdialumma.net/showthread.php?p=362934 5 #بدر_ربيع_الثاني_لكافه_الدول 7zykX1
Does anyone know how I can watch the actual clip of him coming out????? Why didn't they just add it to the end of this clip? I've been having it set to record but because their time and or channel keeps changing it wasn't recorded and I'm so mad!!!!!! lol
i thought the women in the thumbnail was wearing a hospital gown
Hmmm the way she is carrying that baby I can tell it’s a boy too. I have never guessed wrong !
Jeannie is the best!
Stick to subjects like these that doesn't require any use of brain cells
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates .🎈

Horrible
I hope it's a girl so Jeanie can style her lol! Either way I'm happy for them ❤.
Loni an Adrienne sang part of his song was so me hahahahahaa. I'm so in love with the way Jeannie looks at her prince charming. It's so beautiful. I'm extremely happy for her she deserves it
Why don't men. wear socks  or does he have them on. Who is he? What is with all these  stars wearing  sunglasses. inside.  Mixed cultures.  This child  will be biracial  and have many good experiences.  We pray for them and their family  and for God to truly be in their lives.  When is the baby due?
Blessings. For certainty💯✍🏿✍🏿

For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
The Real did us wrong with that clickbait, where is the moment where Jeezy walks in and surprises Jeannie?
OMGGGGG STOP THE WAY HE LOOKS AT HER AND TALKS ABOUT HER HOW MUCH HE LOVES JEANNIE AND HOW MUCH SHE LOVES HIM OMGGGGG!! Jeannie this made my whole year I’m so happy for u and I wish u so many blessings to you and your beautiful family ! 💕💜

First time I see Jeanie silent . That’s a change . 🤣🤣 she’s glowing and looks beautiful though.
Jeannie and Jeezy are so great together!!! 💜😊
why the sun glasses?   WHY
It's beautiful to see 2 adults near the same age in love. And there's idiots mtgtow talking bout men don't want women over 30 . Ha. These 2 are soecial
From the moment I found out Jeannie was pregnant I thought she was having a boy too like Jezzy .. I will be very surprised if she’s having a baby girl but regardless I need her to have a healthy baby!
If Loni and Adrienne don’t stop with the ‘YOUNG JEZZZZZAYYY’ 😂😂😂
I love their love❤️💖🎉
I think Boi too. .
🤪🤪🤪
I love this 💕
Aww soo sweet! You guys are a lovely couple! ❤️
💞Awe….how SWEET..  Jezzy and Jeannie talk about looking forward in sharing this bundle of JOY TOGETHER🐣🥰♥️
LONI AND ADRIENNE 💀
I think it's a boy as well:congrats you two!
This looks like part 2… where is part 1 when he comes out??
You can tell that jeannie is so happy iam so glad for her congratulations guys on your brand new bundle of joy
Seeing Jeanies journey makes me want to wait to have kids until it is absolutely right. Seeing their love bing celebrated in this way is just so heart warming and beautiful.

Take those stupid sunglasses off!!!!!!
its a boy just by looking at her but daddy knows too lol.
Jezzy and Jeannie are SO BEAUTIFUL TOGETHER ❤ 😍 MY HEART MELTS WITH HAPPINESS FOR THEM GOD IS GOOD ❤
Who is cutting onions in this joint?!?!? 😭😭😭😭. I think it's a boy too, and I agree that Jeannie is going to be the best mom.
Loni and Adrienne my kind of friends 😂😂😭😭😭😂😂😭😂😂😂
Journey Jenkins would be a beautiful name ❤️❤️
Beautiful COUPLE!!😘💕😍💝
yeaaaaaaa I got her back 🥺❤️
Jeannie girl I love you but  you're in for a big disappointment....I can see RIGHT THROUGH JEEZY AND I DON'T LIKE WHAT I SEE .
So it's a girl ?
Wish  they shown the beginning to see her reaction when he walks in
https://youtu.be/GunHF8gJyWQ
Dam jeezy a cornball for real...ask Jeannie can u have your dark meat on the side at Magic city..🤣🤣🤣
❤️
Absolutely beautiful!!
Why they fool got sunglasses on and why would he get food before her shower when she can eat when she gets there.
This is Getting sickening between Jeezy and Mai they better not be getting a Divorce a year or two Down the Line  I'll bring up everything They said
😭😭😭 God is so amazing!!!😭😭😭🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Yes I think the same way I think it is a boy too
I think it’s a girl.
I'm so happy for Jeannie she's found true love, we often hear Jeannie talk about Jeezy but there is one IV I watched with Jeezy where you can see the feelings are mutual. Everyone is leaning towards Baby J being a boy it will be interesting if its a girl, as long as the baby is healthy. I know Jeannie is going to be the best mom, you got this!!
"What is to is, is BOUND to must."
I wholeheartedly believe it’s a boy. Her face has not changed but just plump.
The way he talks about her and the way she looks at him❤️.
Beautiful Couple Sooooooo happy 😊
Clickbait thumbnail
I Definitely agree with him that’s going to be a boy and I have the same feeling as him too
Jeezy is in his 40s now I can tell he wants to settle down now and have somebody by his side alot. Jeannie is the perfect lady for Jeezy.
They are both sooo happy n just cute! That’s it, I’m waiting on my soulmate to have more kids … God can u hurry n send me someone like JEezy thankyou ❤️
It’s a GURL… look how Jeanie face morphed- girls will really make prego mommies face temporally change during pregnancy
I feel like she is going to have a boy too!
I am happy for Jeannie and Jeezy, I hope they would have more beautiful babies
When a woman is loved correctly, she glows. You can see it. 🌞
Awwwwww
It's something about her that I don't care for, something sneaky.
https://youtu.be/ghxWcG4OlW4
So happy for them ❤️
Lonnie is HUGE!!!! FUCKING huge!!!!!
Gross!!!
Young Jeezy ~Take it easy. AYEEEE !
I'm over here in tears WOW look at God's work again✨💕👏🏾
I am so blown away by Jeannie. Not because she wasn’t amazing before but because she is a great example of change, growth and stamina. She is visibly softer and more comfortable with Jeezy around. It’s a testimony that when it’s the right person…..it all falls into place somehow. Love to see it!
Where’s the video of him coming out to surprise her?
So Sweet.!!
Where’s part two?!
What did he mean by he needs a boy now?
Omg that's soo sweet.."I have the king showing me the way"...as he should
Beautiful
Wanted a BROTHER BAD HOPE he NEVER hurt her GOOD LUCk!
He would make me change my mind tooo...yasss..
I absolutely love this! Simply beautiful
They kinda look alike you guys😍🥰
I wish them a healthy child and hopefully Jeezy and Jeannie invest wisely J can give up touring still record but find some solid investment ventures...and they'll be fine!
What a beautiful couple.
GET EVERY!!!! DIME!!!😁😁😁 JEANIE!🤣👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👍🏿👍🏿🤣💋   P.S....WOMAN ARE NOT!!! MAD AT YA!!!🤗🤣🤗
Why does he have sunglasses?
Would’ve been nice if we could see his eyes. I’m surprised none of them asked him to take off his sunglasses inside during an interview ! Also as long as the baby is healthy even though he wants a boy. My husband would  never say what he did.
My favorite part about Jeanni is her and Jeezy!  It is sexxxxyyyyy and loving‼️‼️‼️‼️
Their love is so different to Iz and Adriennes  but JUST as beautiful. Jeannies and Jeezy they have a deep respect and deep intellect appreciation of each other.. Its more than smitten it's more than affection it's truly a peace. I am so happy for them. Love to see do many of these women winning in love. From Adrienne to Loni and now Jeannie.. They are truly loved by their men and its so lovely to witness. Congrats Jeannie xw
I LOVE THEIR LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER!!!! So happy for Jeezy and Jeanie
He better be changing more than just a few diapers. That’s a shared responsibility!
They look so in love
I'm with Jezzy, I think it's a boy too.💙
He loves her 💕
I'm with Jeezy I said in the comments a few weeks back, that Jeannie is going to have a healthy baby BOY👶 !
So happy for Jeannie and JZ!
Its a girl!!! What a beautiful baby it will be!!! God bless the first few weeks is hard but you are reAdy!!!
Why does jeezy wear sunglasses all the time? Lololol
Lord it's me again. Please, when am I going to have this type of love???😭😭😭
What kind of fuckery is that
Corny ass... Why the shades tho?!
It’s a boy for sure for sure
I’m so happy for them, such a beautiful couple. God’s timing is always perfect!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Beautiful
Jeannie finally happy 😃
8 months already omg she’s going to have it so soon !!!
Awwwww I have happy tears 🥲🥰

I was smiling with all my teeth showing throughout this interview! Love Jeannie and Jeezy together, you can truly see the love between the two 😭❤️😍
I am so so Happy for my sweet girl Jeannie I love her so much God continue to bless her family 🙂💕💐
Why does he have sunglasses on 🤦🏾‍♀️
Dear Jeannie Mai and Jeezy I am sooo happy for yawls GB and your soon coming baby. 💋💞💋
Good for them both!!
This man turns Jeanni on and it shows.       I hope it continues.     Nothing is better than being happy.     I noticed a video of Jeanni and her first husband, you could tell nothing was there, they were just two individuals,  nothing else.     I would've never known they were married had I not been informed earlier.   She's overall the moon for J I wish them the best.
I think it’s a boy also 👶🏽💙💙💙
I’m here for it!!!!
Awww! I just love them! 😉
Awe I’m happy for them❤️🎉🎉🎉
Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
😍😍😍😍
Does he ever not wear shades?? I don't think I ever saw this man's eyes
Jeanie is glowing 💥💥❤❤
God can dream a.bigger dream for you, than you can dream for yourself 🙏🙏🙏

Where’s the part where Jeezy comes in and suprises them
That’s so Beautiful 😍
Do it Jeezy!!!💕
So glad she wisely chose not to have kids with her ex.  I know that's what kinda ended the relationship but... this is why God put it in her heart to not to.
Why do people wear sunglasses inside so you cant see their eyes!?
Omg they're so cute 😍
It’s a girl 💕
So happy for the both of them
jeannie has found the man who loves the same exact way she does and it’s beautiful to watch. he truly embodies unconditional love and i admire their relationship.  a part of me feels like she’s having a girl🥰
Naa because Jeannie deserves to be happy!! God bless both of them 💗
I think it’s a boy
You can "see" the love between them... They make a great power 💑  couple.  God's blessings.
Why is he wearing sun glasses 😅
So happy for my girl 😍😍😍
I’m sooo unbelievably happy for Jeanie! I smiled from start to finish 🥰🥰
Beautiful love story I love it GOD IS GOOD THANKYOU JESUS NOW WHERE IS MY TRUE LOVE 😇😇😙🥰
Cant believe they didnt invite Adrienne and Loni and Tamera
This segment almost took me out ! There love is not of this world it’s sooooo beautiful to see
Girls are harder pregnancies. She is having a boy.
So happy for Jeannie and Jeezy, I see so much Love there and  I wish them many many blessings. Love this beautiful couple. Stay safe and Congratulations again on your new Baby - I think it’s a boy ❤️
Jeannie says the most sweetest things 🥺 this the type of woman a man needs.

Tryna keep it eassszzyyyy lmaooooo Adrian 😂😂😂
Big Baby J Sr.? Why y’all do him like that? Lol
🕶️ Jeezy has sensitive eyes lol jk
I’m so happy for Jeanie. She deserves all the happiness .
😅i thought that was a scratching post for kitties behind JJ&JMJ 😅😅
whats with sunglasses inside? idk why ppl do that
They're making me wanna fall in love 😩
Ahh not finding out the sex is so fun! My husband and I did that for our last one too 🖤🙈😻
I'm confused by the 2 'part one' videos
how jeannie looks at jeezy 😭😭 she’s so in love, i love it !
Jeannie and Jeezy  Can't wait to see your beautiful baby!  P.S.- my pregnancy was very high risk the whole time because of my diabetes and thyroid. And i got very sick every single day.  She is so smart! My daughter is amazing! Children soak up information like you wouldn't believe! It blows my mind everyday to watch her.  I pray that your baby is healthy and strong.
Jeannie 💓a girl with a good head on her shoulders.  U deserve all the happiness
Loni a trip lolol
I’m friggin crying
I can tell he's vegan. I knew it instantly when he said it before, his skin tells it all. It looks amazing
Jeezy seems kool/ laid back like a mfckr, his swag is kool to see👑
I pray that Jeannie continues to be happy and am so excited for her. She's a good person.
Baby Boy JZjr. Congratulations sweethearts, God’s Blessings 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I love both Jeannie and jeezy, but sorry Jeannie, no woman needs to ever work that hard in praising a man. She drooled over him from day one of their courtship and I said, stop worshipping that man.    And the comment about jeezy teaching you how to be a mother or a woman. NOOOO ! He cannot teach you how to be a woman, or a mother. Can we say you teach him how to be a man and a husband ?   And you both should be honoring each other. This family is not just about Jeezy, so don't brag too much on him. You both have careers, you both will be you  children's parents and raise them equally.  The baby will come out of your body. But he wouldn't let you brag about carrying the baby would he? See men won't let you brag on what you do. So keep that in mind Jeannie.     Jeezy will not have more rights, or power than you,  or with your child that you birth.
That’s a boy belly! ♥️
I have been watching The Real from the first season and it feels good to watch each host evolve.  Jeannie, I am so happy for you! <3
Can't wait to see the baby.
Couple goals, marriage goals
Adrienne you're the next you will also be a great mum. Congrats Jeannie
It’s not even my relationship and I’M confident about it❤️❤️❤️
Jeanie is so sweet....I say from the beginning it's a boy....her energy is so strong she's not sick sick and going about doing her thing....her husband and her are good match...I love them together
❤️❤️
Jeannie finally got a black rapper 😂
I thought boy but I think girl now
Sooo happy for Jeannie! God is never late. She didn't even dreamt of that but God knew what he was doing and gave it to her and Jeezy when he knew he was ready to bless them in his time. Two broken bird being saved at last. What a story and journey of hope! God is really the highest of the highest hold the time. 😇🙏🙌
His voice is soooooo sexy, gosh!!😜😍😍😍😍
Jeannie And Jeezy, Wishing You Both The Best Of God's Blessings An Eternal Love 🙏🏼💙
I’m not crying, YOU’RE crying!!!!!!! Beautiful
What a beautiful story
I never understood why people wear sunglasses in the building three is no sun......son
iam thankful for this online education and love and truth tooo
Jeannie honestly looks like a boy mom😍😍 can't wait to meet Baby J💃💃
👍🏽💯
their relationship is so pure and beautiful
it is so touching how Jeannie is looking at him, and how he is talking about her , omg thats love right there!!! Do you guys know when the baby is coming?
❤️❤️❤️ he's so sweet to her ❤️❤️❤️
I hate the way he dresses. But I love them together. Jeannie is a prize child.
So disappointing to hear how much emphasis is put into a baby's gender.
I love them!!!!
Freddy punk a$$ don’t want no smoke 💨
Jeannie looking at our man like a snack🤣🤣. I’m so happy for us and our baby J🥰
He has three children already so they should be fine.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Girl
She looks happy! I think she brings out the best in him. I hope he appreciates it.
I love Jeannie ❤️ Mai
There's no Sun
But why not also show the part when he’s walking in also?
How am I this happy for people I don't know and that have no clue I even exist? 😭😭😭
thanks God she finally found her dream man rapper
Whoever dresses the plus size woman should be fired definitely  Always dressing her up with big prints  shiny garments etc up to her neck 🙄
They make out like sometimes these ladies be beefing low key but im so proud to see these women have come together to show support ,excitement and love for Jeannie as if she is family for real.I almost wanna shed a tear or two because we all saw how Jeannie went from not ever wanting kids because she was with the wrong man and now she is pregnat with a child from her new husband who is just perfect for her!I cant wait to see the baby i know he or she will be so cute.
Yassss I love Jeezys and Jeanies energy!  She deserves this and more!! Ladies wait for this type of love!!
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
I'm happy for them both. They will be great parents. Just listen the way he talks about her and how she looks at him #love ❤. Boy or girl, their baby is beyond blessed having so much love around 😊😊💙💖
🤮🤮🤮
That man is what you call Grown. The energy is different. The end got me in tears. Thank you for giving us hope Jeannie! So proud of you ❤
Dang Jeannie and Jay are such a sweet and golden couple. The respect, the love, the passion, the intimate knowledge of each other and who each other are is everything everybody should look for. Glad I found my soulmate like Jeannie found hers
Hearts to you Jeannie 🥰
But where’s the surprise part🥲
Chile they so in love 💕
Damn that baby about to look cute as hell!!
Jeannie never looked at Freddy like that the times he was on the show. You can tell she found true love with J. I’m so happy they found each other 🥰
Jeezy wearing a bullet proof vest or some kind of men's waist trainer?
I love them together!
It’s a boy i saw his head😂
They’re going to have a little cute blasian baby❤️🥰🥰
Young jeeezayyyy Tryna take it eazzyyyyyyy
Jeanie not playing about her man
I instantly teared up when he talked about having something together with her. So beautiful
Jeannie, you have inspired me since season 1. God really came through with your blessings! 🥰 You deserve all the love and happiness
ADRIENNE : do  you have to run and get some midnight snack??  JEEZY : no i actually had to make her eat ! (our own auntie in surprised mood) LONI : REALLY!!!  like she doesn't know.  Everybody excited, the rapper in the house
Jeannie has always been such a positive light even after all the trauma. On another note, i thought my sis was sitting there with her belly out lmao
Jeannie is a sweet soul and deserves all the happiness this life has to offer. Blessings
Awwwwwwwww I love them together. I was lil iffy at first but their love n energy is undeniable tbh and I wish them the best
Dang...refused to have a baby with her first husband. Then sits here and cries with joy over having one with her new husband   #1 has to feel a certain way about her happily having a baby with Rich celebrity #2.   Then calls him a king....such a played out and fake comment.
She looks genuinely so happy n content
i couldn't say no more just pricelesa
I really do believe when something is for you, no man can take it away..God makes plan and we live it
Omg I don’t even know her IRL but I’m so happy for her! Every woman deserves this happiness and experience💕
I’m over here crying like I know them! I just love seeing people find love ❤️ I’m next in line lol
My guess is a boy 💙
I feel like it’s a girl! 🎀😊 I’m so happy for her!!! 🥺 and J
Wow. I ain’t supposed to be crying at 3:00 pm watching YouTube.  But, this love right here between all Of y’all is to be modeled.  So much joy.  Blessings y’all.  It’s a boy.
They both look so happy, i hope it continues

Jeannie always makes me cry, she deserves this 🙌🏾 God is good 💕
We're going to need him back with James and Is
I’ve kind of found it weird when people wear sunglasses inside. However he does seem like a really nice guy, she also seems so happy and that’s all that matters.
He looks so stupid with those glasses on indoors. What a mess.
I HATE ....when people wear sunglasses..INSIDE....DURING AN INTERVIEW!!!!!!
where the sun at , cause why he got them shades on
Who's cutting onions 😭 congratulations to the both of them 💙🍼
Okay, y'all heifah's gonna stop making me crying like this with these touchingly beautiful videos!!! 😭😭🥰🤗🙏🏽 I am beyond happy for you Jeezy & Jeannie, and I pray your baby (I agree it's a boy) is healthy, vibrant, gorgeous, kind-hearted, industrious, strong, spiritual and a true light of God! Just Like His Parents!
Where's the part where he came in??? 😡😡😡
She’s blessed blessed 🙏🏾
Why am I screaming, I love love
Something about people who wear su glasses inside thats like not trusting. He seems shady lol
😭🤗🤗
I think they baby will be a boy!
Why he wearing those sunglasses  Distraction and stupid
So sweet loveeee
Great show and Jennie we love 💕 you always and the Real.
So Jeezy needs to take off those stupid glasses, he looks so much better without them. Not sure I can have an honest conversation and barely able to look into someone eyes. And yes they look great together. Jeannie seems so smitten. 😍🥰😍🥰
So happy for them!!!
I really hope he didn’t literally mean “a couple” diapers.
It's a girl
They doing too much lol
*Jeanie YOU are the prize too! You are a QUEEN*
I’ll guess they’re having a girl.
It’s weird seeing a soft side of him I love the rapper Jeezy
Cutest couple. I hope they last forever
💙💙💙💙💍💍💍💍👑👑🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Jeannie’s dress looks gorg as usual
Wow even an Asian woman recognizes her black king.. I like her vibes- best wishes to them.
I feel like it's a boy to Jeezy a healthy baby boy
I think girl
💜💜💜
Why wear shades in a show?
I'm sooo happy for them both. I also think it's a boy 💙
Does anyone have guesses for the gender. I honestly think it will be a girl.
Adrienne’s ‘tryna take it easyyy’ took me out 😂😂😂
Smh… Jeanie got herself some native blood in her foreign line smh… they got u jeezy… they got you. 😔
She loves and respect him
Look at her now😌  Bless her she didn't think she'll ever marry again let alone have a child. But LOOK 👏AT HER 👏NOW👏 ABSOLUTELY GLOWINGGGG👏👏...yess love seeing people win in life💕
No matter how cool you are, sunglasses indoors is just so lame.
#perfection
Does he ever take them glasses off? 😂
I wish they had tamera come out and surprise her too
I’ve thought boy the whole time, too! 💙💙💙
Jeezy is special man...she changed for the best. This energy is amazing. God bless this family
It’s crazy he said he thinks it’s a boy cause my first thought was it’s gonna be a boy!! Jeannie is gonna be a great mom❤️
the way jeannie looks at jeezy
When you’re loved properly, you see things differently. I KNEW my ex would have F’ed my nerves up if we had a child together! How I know? Because he was f’ing them up without a kid.💀🤣 Didn’t think I wanted kids. I enjoyed being the cool aunt. I met my husband…I didn’t want kids, a year married…I gave it some thought, he didn’t switch up on me. I fell deeper in love, gave it A LOT of thought. 3yrs married, my heart was still melting and we planned for our 1st child! Year 4 we had our daughter💖. He was an amazing father. Feel deeper in love. 6yrs later we had our 2nd child. 14yrs married and I’m thankful I changed my mind. If I was still with my ex, most likely I wouldn’t have kids.  The right person can definitely change your mindset! P.s I’m still the cool aunt😎😂
I’m crying 😢 they have such beautiful energy together.
We must learn to keep God out of our shenanigans.
Yes she needed that masculinity in her life! So she could go fully into her feminine. Facts!
Loni and Adrienne killed me at “Young Jeezy!!!”🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why are they wearing pyjamas???
Finally someone has confirmed that Jeezy is from Hawkinsville, GA! For years, us Georgians have gone back & forth on this Friday for some reason. Lol.
You just got to love themmm! #JenkinsFamily
Like Jeanie before, I dont think I want to have kids but seeing this I wonder if its possible for me to change my mind.  The growth is so unbelieveable. I just still cant believe my eyes. The love is real and true. ❤️❤️❤️ Congrats again Jeanie and Jeezy.
Look how y'all have me here bawling out my eyes......safe delivery Jeannie
What a blessing Jeannie & Jeezy found each other. Don't let Mama Mai fool you, she is going to be the main one who spoils Baby J. It's just something about the 1st g-baby. They just have us Grammy's wrapped around their little finger lol.
I absolutely love it
I agree I think it’s a boy
Where’s part 2 ??
The way Jeannie looks at him when he speaks is just 😍😍. She LOOOOVES HER SOME *JEEEEEEZAAAAY!!!*
I’m so in love with Jeanie and Jeezy are
It's definitely a girl, the shape of her belly growth shows it's a girl
Am just so happy for her everytime i see her this happy i feel like its me.
I am the same thinking as a boy, Jay & Jeannie!
I’m happy for her you can see the glow she’s really happy
This video is fantastic from start to finish 🥰🙏💜🤖😁.
I dieddd laughing when Loni bursted out saying "🗣️Young Jeezy" 🤣🤣
BOY💙
So happy for her.........See Ladies wait wait wait for the right man......Notice he doesn't call her out of her openly disrespect you for likes use you for a sex object to have babies out of wedlock........Instead he loves you marries you and treats you like the Queen that you are.......So respect yourself Love GOD and wait and HE will send you a man that loves you
“I have a king as a husband that’s teaching me the way” 😭 Im in a puddle on the floor!!! 😩😭🥰
I'm soo happy for Jeannie, they both look happy. Love to see it! 🎉🥰❤ Loni and A is hilarious. 🤣
I wish someone look at me the way she looks at him
Jeezy is looking GOOOOOOOD!!!!!!
I think it's a girl 🥰🥰🥰❤🤎🙏🏾🤞🏾
nah but look how Jeanie is looking at Jeezy! I love it for her!!
Does Jeezy have a light sensitivity?  He always has shades on
Omg!!!!! I never clicked so fast!!!!
I’m over here cheesing hard af looking dumb! 😂😂😻😻😻
Oh so beautiful that this guy got his wife and baby 👶😍❤
The way Jeanie keeps on asking... "are you scared"?
I hope they work ouy I can tell Jeannie has grown up alot
The studio sound was off☹️
Loni you remind me of my Grandma and I'm 67.
She is going to be an amazing mother. Their love is so clear to see how they uplift each other.
Am I the only one who instantly thought of the roach dress from the original HAIRSPRAYwhen I saw Loni's dress?   😆 🤣 😂
Jeannie has found her true love. Love to see it 😌
Jeezy did not lie when he said kids love Jeannie. That video of her making desserts with Aden and Ariah was just too precious😭
It's a boy
Jeezy has Boss Energy 🤩
It’s a girl
I'm with Jeezy it's a boy. I wish Tamera was there😔
I hope this all work out for them.... Cause hé looks like everything hé do is for her, to make IT same like hé is the good man. I hope from deep down hé just is.... Cause she's over head in love with this man.
I think is a girl because if you hear jeezy say "I seen her with my daughter" might be a clue that she is having a girl.
The way Jeanie looks at him with pure love in her eyes is beautiful! I’m so happy for you both!
Awwe congratulations! I love this! What a wonderful space to be in!

Loni and Adrienne is a mess!!! I always wait when Jezzy is brought up! I anticipate for them to start!! " YOUNG JEZZY, TRYNA TAKE IT EZZY!! I 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm die laughing!
Cant take Loni or Adrienne nowhere! Lol. So cute. I'm so happy for Jeannie. I'm so happy to have been here to see her journey.
*I think its girl because remember he did that song with neyo...*  *"Had them other bitches mad when they seen us* *Had to match our Rolexes baby team us* *Yeah the earth is our turf we can share the world* *Maybe even go half on a baby girl"*
Why y’all trying to make me cry😢😢😢😢
Jezzy you can take them shades of indoors😂
Aweeeeeeeeeeeee omg priceleeeeeesssss love it all tears here
She calm and happy
They're so cute!!!
She truly oozes a child-like energy, that's why she used to call herself "cousin Jeannie
Jeannie & Jezzy are the poster childs for what TRUE love is & looks like. (And I'm here for it y'all)!!! Jeannie was born with the kindest heart & the sweetest temperament, then Jezzy came along and enhanced it even more! She glows brighter than the sun when she's around him. 💯❤
Issa Girl 🎀🌸🌷💗
So sweet. I just realized his sunglasses. Is that part of his look?
Jeannie really got her black rapper wow. Manifestation is big, im so happy for her they seem very happy together ❤
What channel and time does this come on? I feel like since the nick cannon’s show air. I can’t find it.
She varying that baby low and wide. It’s a boy 👶🏽

Omggg this is so adorable. I'm so happy for Jeannie and Jeezy

Love them together he brings out something in her that she didn’t know she had and could feel. He makes her feel comfortable and loved. I knew when they got married she was gonna have his baby. Real loved changed her mind about having a baby. Congratulations! To them.

Must be lowkey hard for Adrienne to be sitting there seeing pregnancy around her..
How sweet!! Love Jeannie and Jeezy..Jeannie is soo beautiful.. ❤❤❤❤
For real though : why glasses inside? Genuine question
I think jeezy it going to to be awesome father and jeezy going to be awesome dude
Loni looks amazing..love her clothes and look this season.
Congratulations Jeannie!  She looks so happy!    What's going on with Loni?
I’m happy for them! Very sweet.
They're the custest, can't wait for baby J.
I love that Jeannies in love and happy but there’s something about Jeezys body language, he seems cold and unaffectionate idk 🤷🏻‍♀️
This couple has something so special! God continue to bless their union .. no weapon formed against them shall prosper!!
Why is he wearing sunglasses indoors?
I'm clapping and crying the whole time  Amazing couple
Sooo sweet!!
Jeannie loves this man. He better not mess up
Go back to the first few seasons and you'll see the stuff she says. She always wanted a Black man (rapper/athlete/celebrity) while married to Freddy. Tamar definitely used to call her out about it.
I’m so happy for Jeannie, she looks so happy and at peace and that’s important in a relationship. I think it’s a boy 💙
hi
What is it with African American men and wearing shades inside? Its so rude when you can't see a persons eyes...
Love can do anything and this is the example. Congrats to them parents and these ladies they are so excited . Omg these episodes are awesome
Somebody give Jeannie a baby (boy and girl), the gender that doesn't cry is the gender she's having 🤩🤩 love you and congratulations
It's a baby girl!!!!
I hope its a boy, they both would raise a good man
I'm happy for her. She looks so at peace and happy.
So HAPPY!
Jeanie so smart and has stories for days she will be a great mom hell If I had kids I’d let them go to Aunty Jeannie house! Lol
where is the surprise part it's not in the video?
Jeannie said "I GOT A KING" 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
“Young jeeezyyyy” “Take it easyyyy” I died!!
Loni and Adrienne killed me with that Young Jeezy 🗣️🗣️🤣🤣 they really are the friends you can't bring round everywhere but really that's your best friend lol 🤭
The way Jeanie looks at him 😍 Such a beautiful couple ! May god keep blessing this union✨
YASSSSSSSSSSSS FINALLY JEEZYS ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I agree. It's a boy.
Jeezy Jr. I believe it’s a boy!
I'm glad I can enjoy this "baby shower" episode here. I was watching it on Fox and it got interrupted. I was wondering when the real was going throw a baby shower for her! Congrats once again to Jeannie & Jeezy! And love the sisterhood ladies!🥰🥰🥰🥰
Jeezy is a phenomenal man glad jeannie got the man she deserves
Super happy for them❤️ Looks like a girl🧐💕
Seeing Jeanies journey makes me want to wait to have kids until it is absolutely right. Seeing their love bing celebrated in this way is just so heart warming and beautiful.
Congratulations to them both I am happy for them! Jeannie looks super happy .

It’s a girl.
I pray the baby is a healthy girl.
“Young jeeezyyyy” “Take it easyyyy” I’m done with them 😂

Why is he wearing sunglasses inside 😎 😅 but anyways I love the way he show he cares for her so sweet ♥️
So happy for Jeanie and her journey ❤. She just exudes positivity, strength and authenticity
If you don't get emotional watching this, you need to go get a heart checkup!
Dang I want to see the part where he walked in and her super surprised face...

I hope it's a girl! It would be cute for Jeannie to have a little fashionista lol
Love is such a beautiful thing hey🥺❤❤❤🙏🏽
Initially thought a boy but the shape of her stomach says girl.
If you're not smiling your heart needs some hot chocolate 💕💕🥰
This might be the coolest dude on earth. Wearing sunglasses inside is such a flex!!! 😂

Soo beautiful ❤️❤️❤️ love y’all so much so happy for jeannie beans
Adrienne and Loni cracking me up😂😂🤞 _"Young Jeezy, tryna take it eazzyyy!! "😂🔥
Jeezy really makes it look easy  !!! This is the first time we’ve seen them on the show together as a couple and married while expecting together !!! If that ain’t a full circle moment 😭! Who would’ve thought they met in November 2015 and got married in March 2021 & are now expecting in January ! Love is Real !!!
Loni & Adrienne Play Too Much! 🤣🤣🤣 Young Jeezy! Tryna Take It Easyy!
Would have been nice to watch the big surprise 🙄
The crazy part is she didn’t wanna have kids at all in her last marriage that’s the reason why they got a divorce they wanted too different things now she got remarried and now she’s pregnant I’m still very happy for her
Y’all got me grinning like a chestcat 😁😁😁😍😍😍😍😍😍
I always thought he was cute, but imma need to see his eyes.. lol
OMG the way she looks at him and the way he talks about her … 😍😍😍
I love u girls and i had a question, how did tamera react
It's a boy
I really hope this guy can keep it in his pants and not cheat...I'm being realistic people
Can’t stop smiling 😊
I can't wait for baby j. I believe it's a girl, I hope it's a girl.
There’s something about Jeezy. Jeannie definitely dodged a bullet with her last marriage and got a full bag. Congrats to them.
The Real! Now, c’mon! Y’all couldn’t show this clip from the beginning when he ACTUALLY SURPRISES HER?! 🙄😒
Finally Jeezy is back on The Real as a couple! 💕
