kyle van noy was a beast at 8:12
RBT thought the dolphins would lose “nah he was wrong”                                    —Dolphins fan
(8:12) - (10:35) - (14:45) Nice hit 🏈
https://youtu.be/a8deD9QO8z4 Ice Cube ain't trippin'...
Omg i waa watching the match with a thought of going to watch live, until i met this forex trader @dennis__forex09 on instagram  who was able to guide on how to place expert trade and now i'm making more profits,shot a direct message telling him i referred you .
1:09 wow
IT'S TUA TIME🕑 DON'T CARE WHAT ANY OF Y'ALL THINK👊😡 THIS KID IS THE BEST QUARTERBACK OUT OF THE DRAFT AND HE'S SITTING #SMH🤔 WAY TO GO MIAMI...
Tua would make our offense better
These losses are slowly chippin away my faith in my team lol
14:48 is buddy ok?
I will not watch the NFL anymore but it’s always nice to hear the Jaguars lost. Sooner they move to London the better.
The Dolphins have my support in Australia
Thought this would be a fun replay since it had a lot of views...  Thought wrong.
So... No one called the unsportsmanlike conduct on Myles Gaskin... No one.. Refs suck..
Dolphins are so bad
If the dolphins play like this for the rest of the season they’re gonna be unstoppable   Like if you agree
I like joe bucks commentary
Nice block by Fitzpatrick
FITZCEPTION
Anyone else watching to predict Seahawk game or only me?
Minshews receivers left him hanging in this game.  Still dropped 275 yards though.
Week 3 of the 2020 NFL season was the battle of Florida between the Miami Dolphins and the Jacksonville Jaguars.
Dolphins sure look different, now that Dan Marinos' gone.
C"c"cccccccccc"
hey
Go Miami!!
Nice game to watch for once, finally this Phins team is looking like they looked at the end of last season. Great fun to watch!
Systemic racism does not exist in America let alone in our police force.
Dolphins have some of the best jerseys in the NFL
So JAGUARS.
Fitzpatrick is arguably the most polarized QB ever
How about those Dolphins???
When the commentators say “ the jaguars staff  have/ has  done a good job putting this team together “ 😂🤣 while they’re losing 21-7 no less AT HOME ,however ...Jacksonville cut  their 4th overall pick L .fornette  and they couldn’t get anything for him that’s  got to be the worst franchise in the NFL  history .they’ve had a top 10 pick 7 years in a row a top 5 pick 6 years in a row they’ve cut or traded all of them and have nothing to show for it  . Yeah great job Jacksonville staff well done 🤣😂
Thursday night football is so irrelevant lmao
1-2-1 Next week Jags trash
So we not going to talking about that running back getting run over🤣🤣🤣 8:15
What they always put the thumbnail as if the winner of the game is the team
Dolphins tight end is on another level
8:15   Number 34 got owned
Picked up minshew before the week for my fantasy team, really let me down
Thought I was watching a highschool game for a sec
Jags are the worst team in the nfl unless they win next game & dolphins lose.
Jax QB played bad asl  no bap 🤣💀 Miami Was on all Madden He made some bad decisions put his receivers in bad spots Shout out to James Robinson 🔥🔥🔥!! Wish he would’ve gave you more Check downs The way Miami was coming after him 💀  Seems selfish to run for yours yards as a quarterback when your RB is open for a check down He is there to ensure you escape pressure having lil throws here n there Coming out the huddle with your mind made up on who you want to throw is a good thing don’t get me wrong But you have to look at all your players and he know this as a quarterback !!! Smh He played uninspired from the outside looking in
NfL rugby en vivo
Concussion
Fitzpatrick Ryan has beaten the Jaguars with 6 different teams
I feel bad for Gardner Minshew. He has starting talent but was just drafted by a bad team/organization. Jags decided to trade all their star players for nothing.
If My Dolphins play like this every week,we are gonna give teams problems. Phins Up.
Wait no minshewmania?
Those highlights are getting way too long. They used to be half the length last season. You don't have to put every down in there 😂😂😂
8:12 so no one seen how the RB got blown up
Minshew had an awful game
It's called a game for a reason. In ancient Babylon, those who possessed influence and power were bent on keeping the minds of the people engrossed with mirth and pleasure, lest any should be impressed by the solemn warning that preceded its overthrow: https://www.great-controversy.eu/read-on-line
@ 11:57. DB flys in leading with head. Not a word not a flag. He didnt get the other guys head. But was perfect example. Nothing done nothing said till someone gets seriously hurt.
About time Miami wins
Announcers say some dumb things but implying that you can force chemistry has got to be one of the funniest.
Why they dont seem happy about making that touchdown tho 12:57
Every time the jags throw it deep something bad happens
Dolphins play calling, much better!
8:12 watch Van Noy hit Thompson into 2021
Jacksonville used to be super
Ah yes Fitzmagic
Gardner minshew trash.
Looks like we got some fitz magic this week so next week will be an underwhelming Fitzpatrick lol
Always fun to watch the two worst teams in Florida play each other.
that Minshew guy sucks
About time @dolphins
13:28 i think 33 punched
Dan Marino played really well in this game
I believe I'm going to watch the movie The longest Yard which is real. No politics in that movie they just play football.
I ain't a dolphins fan but dang
The Dolphins have struggled thus far but I like the look on both sides of the ball.  A young team with a good coach and young stud QB soon to take over.  Watch out AFC east and the rest of the league.  I think we saw a preview here.
Miami has the Dolphins...
That sack @7:05
Minchew literally threw 5 yard pass every drive. Don't know if this is the play calling or Minchew just dumping it 5 yards every time.
Go Fins!
https://youtu.be/YKdvEayNGRw
1 win? Dolphins going to the Superbowl!
so we just not gonna talk ab the thumbnail
I don’t like being a jags fan
Watching these football highlights I notice that Aikman sure talks a lot during live play (as compared to all the other co-hosts)
They should have gave tua a chance to play
Fitz is still fast for an old guy,  and still has a rocket arm at times, even accurate when his feet get set first........ But that block using his throwing arm and right shoulder try to stop a tackler's helmet and shoulder pad colliding at high speed sure makes his judgement questionable. Could have been "Tua-Time" from that moment on.....
Nfl getting a bit annoying with the HIGHLIGHTS. They’re showing NON-HIGHLIGHT plays just to pad video length.   Like a 5-6 yard run? Who is that a highlight for? The Jaguars? The Dolphins?   Wasting a bit of my time.
Good on Fitz.  He handled that young offense really well.
Looked like the Jags got that fumble to me.
1:11 what is that guy doing???
I cant believe Minshew did not pull this off.  This is why I hardly ever bet against Miami. You just never know what team is gonna show up with Fitzpatrick. I got screwed once again betting against Miami! Never again!
@NFL, over 6 millions of subscribers and you had to put in 2 unskippable Ads right at the beginning of this video? How low can you go NFL? This video gets a huge "thumbs down" for two reasons, 1: two equally mediocre team trying to prove which is more mediocre. 2: annoying unskippable Ads.
Great bounce back game for #23 for Miami.
That extra tackle by Wingard should have been a flag
Can Minshew throw past 5 yards? Check downs for days
AMAZYNG THE OUTCOME OF A FOOTBALL GAME WHEN YOU PLAY PUMP UP LIKE THAT
Is minchu any good? Or just an off day. Looked AWFUL
Garbage defense
James RB1NS0N SZN BABY
subscribe to me for a free gift!🎁🎉
I’m from Miami n I don’t like the Miami dolphins they trash asf🤦🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
Does Minshew know how to throw the ball past 10 yards?
Minshew sucks
Jacksonville abused by Fitzmagic
Huh old mans got a little speed too. And for an old man he did something most QB’s are scared to do. And that’s block of try at least.
Minshew sounds like a WRX STI
That Jag DB just started clapping, no contact. Unbelievable.
unfortunately these highlight-videos are getting worse und worse. leaving out essential scenes and replays. after watching one of these i sometimes wonder if my attention span is like one of a fish because i missed some touchdowns or othe important things.
Joe Buck is talented, I like when he says : « Pass is caught for a 1st down ». It so difficult to see. Genius.
Who the hell did Jacksonville beat?! 😂🤣😂. Miami is Awful as well! Never did I ever imagine I would say Buffalo is the best team in the AFC East, New England is second-best… Jets and Miami are looking at Trevor Lawrence! LOL. And I’m a Giants fan… So I can make fun of anyone because my team has picked in the top 5 over the last four years… LOL. I made a deal with the devil, living in New England and saying if the Giants can just beat the patriots in the Super Bowl then I don’t need anything ever again. It just so happens that I got my wish twice… So it is what it is. I’ll live in Purgatory. I will say that I believe the Giants will continue to get better week after week, even without saquon. Thinking close to 500 at the end of the year… Guess we’ll see if I’m right.
The Dolphins defense played pretty good.
I have to admit, that was a good game.
Dolphins: win 1 game.  People: "the dolphins are so underrated" Also dolphins : "1st win with more than 10 points since December 2017"
If you’re hyping up the dolphins they played the jaguars if they lost imagine the embarrassment
I thought Fitz was only good every other year.  He had a good one last year and should be awful this year.
Minchew sucks. He throws up high risk minimal reward kind of passes.
my god the jaguars defence is garbage...
100% natural coconut shell products shop on etsy https://www.etsy.com/shop/SahasraNatureCafts
M. Gecike catch was beautiful
Dolphins actually did good this game
If you so play like this while going against Jacksonville you have a lot of rebuilding to do... # Greenbay fan.
So the ref just didn’t throw the flag on 42 of the Jaguars after throwing dude after the play?
Haha he said geseki I thought he said doohickey
Grant is soo good
Dolphins offense is surprisingly fun to watch. A lot of cool play design
BEAUTIFUL FRANCE...FOLLOW N SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE
13:47 sup bit**
It’s fun knowing most of the dolphins team from madden 20
Minshew really didn’t play bad...
Terrible play calling from Jacksonville
I see they edited out the pathetic ejection of Cam Robinson. Even the NFL media team isn't standing behind it
I quit caring.
8:11 great pancake by the d tackle
Titans fan just stopping in to say that the jaguars are garbage! That’s all.
I would like to see tua play
🏈🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇
1:12 anyone else see that 😂😂
@
I feel like all the underrated teams this year are gonna do well
Some if anyone else like me was wondering football won’t be back Amazon Prime Video until Bears Bucs game
Hearing Minshew's "Rhino Rhino set!" cadence brings back memories of the Jay Gruden offense. Top 5 in the league when it works, but a disaster when it doesn't (or pieces are missing)
So Dede Westbrook not a contributor anymore???
Boycott the NFL  !
First NFL game I ever watched ever was Dolphins vs Jaguars in 2006, I say me and football have come a loooong way, cheers for me. What a game as well.
love
I live miami dolphins
Didn’t even know this game was on lol the nfl didn’t care to advertise
I love it when my games are over at halftime. You can get alot done or in this case get more sleep. CLASSIC JAGS! DUVVALL!
What happend to burrow
Jeeeez
Didn't the whistle blow before gaskin got threw WTF
How was that a flag on cj hen #23 it looked like clean defense.
Jags back to how everyone expected them to be
Forget Fitzpatrick. Can we address our trash running game even though we run by committee? We have no mid field power run game. All our back are under 200 lbs except 1 and we barely use him. We beat Jax great but how would we fare against Baltimore or KC our own division? We don’t.
Why is the NFL allowing players to wear neck chains while playing, that's a decapitation waiting to happen.
Just as many people watched celebrity family feud as this game....
lol fitz is a fullback
Good Game
https://youtu.be/tgU4FS7hZ5E
" I wasn’t going to ask for it so we could embarrass ourselves on prime time." - Khan . Owner of jaguars  2018.
Last week they said that we had the worst rushing yards last season, that changed.
Jags o line looks like trash lol
At 8:16 that should’ve been a pick 🙄
Joe "Cut Back" Buck
0:15 that should have been a flag on 42 but hey refs are refs  🤷🏽‍♂️
WALTER T. JESSUP AND SHERMAN N. ADAMS:  If either of you read this, FUNK the Dolphins!
NFL...who cares.
They let the dolphins win tho like whaaaaaaaa 🤨🤨🤨
8:13 ouch..
B
Damn.. Miami defense is thirsty asf
Who saw this coming? Fitz looked like Aaron Rodgers out there!
Dolphins looking nice 👌🏾
I'm a patriot fan but people be sleepin on the dolphins and honestly don't give them the credit they deserve they a pretty good goddamn team
Dear Y.T. morons:  You asked me my preference for a candidate in a district I don't live in, even in a state I don't live in.  I answered your stupid question and now have been inundated with attack ads on the candidate I chose, even though I can't vote for either.  How stupid are you?
fitzmagic
Eat that jaguars put the knees in the floor cause the dolphins humiliate you. And keep the knee in the floor. Trash team got to be close to the floor
14:58 Xavien Howard a little confused
m.youtube.com/DisneyXDUK
youtube.com/results?search_query=https%3A%2F%2Fm.youtube.com%2Foops
Fitzpatrick juked Joe Shobert?
The ofenssive line of jaguars is bad and fitzpatrik not make long pass🙄🙄🙄 Brasil assistindo NFL...rsrs
Ryan Fitz I'm gonna give dolphins fans hope just to crash them the following week patrick this man is the definition of inconsistent
how is this not unsportsmanlike conduct or unnecessary roughness?  0:23 ???
James Robinson needs to play for Miami dolphins so they can be unistoppble
the secret is to not expect anything from ryan fitzpatrick.
I am being optimistic for the last time but I think it was cuz Chark wasn't on the field and Conley dropped passes that would've given us the first down
Hate the word new normal no such thing. What they're planning for stadiums 90%empty? . It should be going back to normal.
I didn’t watch the game, but from the highlights Miami looked way more juiced, only the rookie rb was juiced for Jacksonville
Minshews a glorified mayfield. Not near great, but gets a lot of media attention
Is minshew mania over? Say it aint soooooo
James Robinson played good.
Dolphins number 66 doing literally nothing bruh 8:38
Did Minshew complete a pass that was longer than 10 yards this game?
Lmao 1:08 welcome to the NFL CJ Henderson this ain’t college 💀💀💀💀
Jags fans don't watch
Mics picked up something at 13:48
We was pose to beat them ppl how Ravens did us the first game of the season last year
The teams suck, but at least thier uniforms are nice to look at
I searched up dolphin to get the SOOBIN dolphin FANCAM for TikTok and this showed up-
8:12 A MAN HAS BEEN MURDERED
10:41 what kinda hit was he trying to make😂 what a pansy
Dolphins ???  - Ooooo.. that's Fishist. Jaguars ???  - Ooooo.. that's Catist.. REDSKINS  REDSKINS  REDSKINS  REDSKINS  REDSKINS  REDSKINS  REDSKINS...
Winged still pissed about King Henry shoving his face into the ground, Week 2. 🤣
Marrone has historically struggled against coaches from the Belichick tree.......
Finally a big win for Miami!!!!!!! :D
Fitzmagic's change to a dual-threat, battering ram QB is the greatest late-career transformation of all time
This is boring compared to rugby 🙄
Bro Miami be getting hype in that end zone
Fitzmagic never lost his motivation to play. Still grinding after 15 plus years. Blocking, rushing, and passing
How are the  Jacksonville Jaguars are for number of years
this the jags we expected
Fitzmagic
Where Lynn Bowden? I was surprised my Raiders trade him
5:03 worst challenge ever Lol
He throw He attac  But most likely..        Ryan Fitzmagic is bacc
Dolphins played with a chip on their shoulder. Sheesh
Dolphins fans ain't talking about Tua today?  --DIEHARD Fish fan
@:23 WTF was that? Was the runner's left knee not fully down?  EDIT: He has to do it again @1:14. And WTF is #33 clapping for? You didn't make a play plus you forgot to down the guy.
Dude the dolphins have kind of a  hard schedule which is bad
1:07 this is the funniest play ive ever seen
If you drank every time Joe Buck says PASS IS CAUGHT you’d die.
1:12 tf is the Jags CB thinking?
Go pack go
Number 23 gon get released lmao.
8:11 Van Noy absolutely DESTROYS the chip blocker 💥
14:55 Xavien celebrating a completion 🤣
Fitz underrated.
Who else is 25 points down?
Know we know why they let leonard go robinson is Niccccceee
Did a blowout win by two non contenders really need a 15 minute highlight video?
OK can the Jag O line block...at all?? Yikes they were like Swiss cheese this game!
Just think if the Dolphins would of kept Jarvis Landry instead of sending him to Cleveland. They would have a very nice set of receivers. Landry as the number one and Parker as a super solid number two.
Like watching a really bowl game
I guess we can safely say... minshewmania is over
Dolphin fans, I have a great nickname for Tua. I call him the "Big KaTuna" a play on The Big Kahuna. He plays for the fish and Tuna rhymes with Tua. No? Okay, maybe I am a moron, lol.
7:54 principal O Shag Hennessey is playing with the jags? I didnt know that lmao...if u know u know
The Jags looked like they were playing zones the whole game 😂🥱
8:13 boys lets get a rip for the RB
yo both uniforms were fire
Literally 99% won’t see this but god bless you and stay safe I’m struggling to Get to 1k with notis 🔴
“The staff has done a great job putting this team together” Are we watching the same Jaguars team?
If Miami only played the Jets, Bengals, Jags, Broncos,  *REDSKINS* ,  Lions, Panthers, and Giants all year....they'd make the post season
I think the 23 from the Jags , has no more Job tomorrow xD
From a Colts fan. Thank you dolphins!!! Let’s goo
anyone else notice the madden play style of the jags? literally running drags every play 🤣
8:17 BOOOM!
Love how the poll said "who's gonna win" 81 percent said Jags and 19 said dolphins, lol go dolphins
*@**8:13* boy got laid out 😭
Minshew got potential. His O-line sucks
Jaguars safety 29 is soft. Scared to lay some hat.
People seem to forget we have the best qb from the draft on the bench 💀💀💀
Those uniforms! Yikes
They need to play tue
BLACKS MEXICANS AND NATIVE AMERICANS AND JAMAICANS AND CUBANS WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE REAL HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE BIBLE RESEARCH
0:16 the details don’t matter too much because he made the first down, but that was 2nd and 3
13:47 Two friends saying whatsup in passing lol.
Jacksonville you give the game away. Are you serious you look like 0 and2
who else remembers when highlights were less than 10 minutes long
The day the Jags get a decent O-Line is the day we start contending. Look at each play with a  sack, bad pass, and or scramble,  the pocket collapses in less then 2 sec!
Respect to Fitz for sacraficibg his body out there for an old qb tho lmao.
I've been a Miami dolphins fan since the 80's and I have hope in them year after year and I always WILL
I like how when people score a TD O linemen go up to them and drape over them kinda like they are their big brother tho lmao.
Fitzpatrick is literally the NFL version of Dusty Rhodes cutting his own version of "Hard Times" across NFL stadiums every where. #FINSUP #FEARTHEBEARD #FITZMAGIC
What a legend resoect for that block Fitzmagic.
You can see Brian Flores already making an impact especially on defensive side. Fundamentals so much better for MD than last couple seasons
NFL betting odds. 😂😂😂
Yeah all that minshew mania hoopla died on the week 1 hill. Now it’s a race to the Trevor Lawrence sweepstakes
Just me or is the Dolphins’ social media being super annoying after this win
The dolphins realize they played a garbage team ?
It’s a shame.. Eifert was killin it in Cincinnati till the injury.
1:15  Dear #23, I’m sorry to hear you’ll be losing your starting spot.
Theory- Shad Kahn hates this team which is why he hires terrible coaches and will move the Jaguars to London permanently. 🇬🇧Kahn saying the Jaguars are staying Jacksonville sometimes feels like a total lie. Give this team that has embarrassed Jacksonville for over 20 years to England.
Bruh  8:11 Chenault gets laid out
As a jaguars fan losing to the Dolphins in Jacksonville was just embarrassing. We are no longer Sacksonville we are Sadnessville. We need a new kicker and coach. FIRE DOUG MARRONE. If we go 1-15 sadly it won’t be surprising. If we don’t beat the bungles next week we will be a bigger pit of misery than the LOLphins or the Lions. A FCS college football coach can do a better job than Doug Marrone.
James robinson is the greatest steal I've ever had in fantasy
Dang watching minshew throw nothing but 5 yard crossing routes makes Dak look like Arron Rodgers
bruh  0:22
Gesicki is the real deal!
What was happened to the Dolphins？😂😂
I knew they were gonna win when they did this pole. Let's go bois!
fitz downfield blocking? i love it
Dolphins
These commentators... sounds like talladega nights ffs
Should be named Dolphins vs Jags entire game minus incompletions.
NFL is blackballing the Jags this comment keeps getting deleted
WE FORGET THAT YOU HAVE TO LEAD THE MEN AT THAT QB SPOT IN THE NFL>> TO MANY TIMES QBS ARE WAY TO YOUNG MINDED TO  lead THE MEN>> ITS NOT JUS ABOUT SKILL> FITZ MAGIC LIVES ON >>THERES DOZENS OF VETRANS SITTIN AT HOME > THERE BETTER THEN SOME OF THESE GUYS AT THE QB SPOT
Come on NFL YouTube editor. There was not 15:36 of highlights in this game....
Starting Fitzpatrick  in Fantasy was a good decision. Starting Shenault as well was not
Worst tnf in years lol
D. J. Chark do do do do do do, D. J. Chark do do do do do do, D. J. Chark do do do do do do , D.J. Chark...
This Jags offense is awful lol
Robinson is what’s up. Starting dude in my line up every week now.
This felt like an AAF game.
I just want Fitz to go In the HoF for best journeyman
WHAT A HUGE UPSET...
Jags just threw chuck downs the whole game lol
I JUST HAD THREE ADS LET ME WATCH THE VIDEOOOOO
Could joe buck be any less interested in doing his job?
I dont see anything great about Minchew
Watch Kyle Van Noy PANCAKE someone 8:10
Minshew Mania v  Fitzmagic  Mustache v Beard  The matchup I've been waiting for
Joe Buck: CUTBACK
Minshew mania, will surpass Hulkamania.
This is why I like Fitzmagic 0:20 I've never seen a QB rush ahead like that for block. I don't care if he sucks xD
I wish Tua played
Dink and Dunk Mania
Plain and simple, that's an old-fashioned ass whooping
Any Dolphins fans can attest to that first drive being our best drive since 2016
Fitzmagic one of the best journeyman qbs of all time
1:12 To anyone who know the NFL rule plz explain to me why the Ref didn't stop him right there after he caught the ball ( when he fall)?
Wow.
Forrest Gump: Fitzpatrick is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get
Jags should wait a couple years and take spencer rattler
Did anyone notice on the second play that Fitz handed the ball off, then ran in front of his receiver and took out a safety 15 yards downfield.  This guy would be a star if only he ever had a chance to play with a good team.
Fitzpatrick down the field with the block! LFG!!!!!
@14:57..  why do CBs love signaling "no good" but they did nothing on the play, in this play he still caught it and it was a First down....    LOL LOL
Idk why everyone thought the jags were gonna win
Good win my phins keep them coming 👍🏼👊🏼
0:01  The moment it was all over for the Jaguars.
Today we learned to never touch a ref without their consent
Come on Jags
Jacksonville defense don’t even care. 0 effort.
🏈🏈🏈
This is the first time that the Dolphins have won a game by 10+ points since week 13 of 2017
Why are there fans at some games and  not at others?
14:57 😂😂😂 DB funny asl
Mvp Fitzpatrick
🐬💙🧡💙🧡💙🧡🐬
Great work with the editing, made for awesome highlights. Thanks you 😎
I’m so mad I started minshew over Big Ben, I’m projecting to lose by 2
I picked up minshew and I feel bad for anyone else that did
I have never seen a web run with the runner as a blocker
What a train wreck the Jags were.  Ugly.
Miles the gas kan gonna be a beast in the nfl
So much for the tank..Thanks Jacksonville!
Miami does deserve a lot more credit
I had dolphins winning the whole Time 🤷🏻‍♂️  -chiefs fan
Wow what a throw and catch. Brandon Jones read that perfectly 3:45
next season tua will be 10x better than fitztragic
Damn wasnt expecting that
Miami SHOULDVE wore their orange color rush 🥵 for some reason they wear white at home
I’m boutta pick Fitzpatrick as my starting full back
Minshew ruined my chance for a win this week.. should've kept Josh Allen smh
So did the jags go back to their old helmets from the gold matte black helmets?
Imagine starting Fitztragic over Malcom Perry and Tua
One of the worst games, won by the best worst qb in the franchise
Respect to fitz did anyone see him run up and block first handoff of the game!?
can we shut up about Minshew Mania atleast for a week
Man. Fitz cuts up sometimes
Jags fans watching rn   👁 👃 👁  💧 👄💧
CJ Henderson and akuda are looking bad early
FitzMajic showed up tonight !!!
Robinson looking GOOD
i’ve never seen average qb get hyped up so much in the nfl like minshew
Guess who had James Robinson on the bench 😭
A player gets ejected pushing a refs hand and thinking it was a player but there is not at least a flag at 0:22??
The clips are great,Joe Buck is not.just his usual annoying stuff.
I see why the Dolphins are 0-2, theyre passing in the spread when there up 14 in the 3rd quarter.. Lol try & beat a good team with that formula.
Should of beaten the bills as well
15 MINUTES OF "HIGHLIGHTS"?????  WTF
I haven't seen the dolphins defense hit like this in forever
fish swimming well
Robinson got me 30 fantasy points
I cant wait for the dolphins to start playing good, we finna get that 8-8 record and lose wild card all the time
1:13 yep that’s how you defend 🙄
1:12. Henderson forgot he wasn’t in college anymore
This man fitzpatrick plays like it's the superbowl every game gotta appreciate that. TNF reminded me of that one crazy season he had with the Jets
Dumpster Juice Bowl..y’all better off Watchin my weak Fishin video https://youtu.be/fKWbvPm6M08
The Dolphins take game 1 in the battle of Florida
1:11 this ain’t college that play isn’t over and you clapping 🤦🏽‍♂️
:25 Check out Fitz laying the hat on #37 to block for his RB. Love this guy
Robinson is gonna be so good this year I just feel and in one season is gonna solidify himself as at least a top 5 running back in calling
We didn't have DJ Chark or Josh Lambo so don't think old man is gonna do great this year.
Dolphins look halfway decent for a change, im really enjoying watching Gaskin run the ball. Im ready to see a Tua start
9:58 wtf they doin 😭😭😭🤨
Losing to the Dolphins is the ultimate test to prove if a team is garbage or not.
bro you guys lost to the dolphins smh
With Fitzpatrick's history of bad losses I am surprised that started him over Tua
Did minshew throw the ball in the air pass 15 yds in this game?
"Minshew magic" my ass.....
So glad I picked up Robinson as a FA in fantasy. And I started Miami defense lol
Played against Gaskin in highschool.... Small but we couldn't touch him so It didn't matter. He went to an all Male highschool so we laughed it off with all the jokes that go with that🤣😂🤣😂🤣. He's a stud.
Fitzpatrick is better then Lamar Jackson
Game of the year! Only because it was between two likeable personalities at QB beard vs stache lol
Jaguars does pretty good against two good teams  Also the jaguars against the dolphins: Listen guys I got a plan.
Poor Miami.. I'm not a Miami fan but every time I watch their games all I see are errors. Missed tackles, wrong man to man coverage or zone coverage without thinking of a stop in the red zone. I can't blame the QB as it's the defense that needs to step up.
0:20 look at the block from Fitzpatrick! That was amazing! Props to him 👏
Joe Buck makes it so hard to watch.  Boring,redundant.  We can see the game Joe.
James Robinson fantasy pickup/league winner of the year?
13:47 Whats up B**ch?
LMAO 1:12, CJ still think he in college😂
8:13 rip to that rb
🚽 Bowl II
@9:59 imma need an explanation Fitzpatrick
I'm so mad, either Fitzpatrick plays like a 7th grader and loses me games, or he plays like a reincarnation of Drew Brees and also  loses me games
One of the best game jerseys.. Dolphins take that
You got gassed
Jerick McKinnon or Chris Carson, fantasy who should I start 🤔
These highlights are getting kinda TOO long
1:08 "Nice catch man"  *HE'S NOT DOWN YOU IDIOT*
Good teams. Great day today I got to jog in wet grass just something about that makes me feel good. U know. Two very go QBs I say
From the highlights it looked like Minshew just kept throwing check downs
Anyone catch that hit at 8:14? 😳 talk about running someone over
Remember when the jags defense was stacked and then they let it all fall apart?
Why does he keep doing this?
O-H
The one week i get minshew in fantasy
Legit impressed mr Fitzpatrick
The dolphins put there fur down and said “We ain’t losing” and they did not just win they crushed the jaguars
Someone must have explained what a tank is to Minshew.
Thursday night football, killed the League. Why do we STILL have it?
can u please get me to 1k subs im having a hard time with money  please
Lol #25. 14:56
I hate when you see players smiling and laughing like bro look at the scoreboard wtf you smiling about that’s why you’re loosing!
Looks like the beard shall beat the mustache
8:13 watch a blocker get decimated 💀
I benched Nick Chubb for Robinson this week! Thank Gawd Robinson played tremendous
I’m a dolphins fan with James Robinson on my fantasy I’m felling gooooood
With the rookie wr out there I have a feeling chark isn't gonna get double teamed in the future that often
This was sad it was like watching 2 high school games
Fitzpatrick IS Alex Moran he only cared when he has to try
I’m ready to see Tua nowww
They mentioned Byron Jones in one of the clips but I didn’t see him out there. Anyone know if he’s hurt or what # he is
To all u guys saying “they didn’t have DJ Chark” Miami didn’t have Byron Jones either so stop making excuses.
The amount of checkdowns by the Jaguars is scary.
Dang
How many Jags fans left after the 3rd quarter? lol
Tbh gaskin has been playing pretty good to.
42 on the jags likes to play dirty
3:12 Power-I! Old school football!
Let me guess, pass is..... Caught?
8:14 little rb never stood a chance lol
So the jaguars are only good when you think they’re gonna get smacked
10:00 What type of celebration is that 😳
A classic flitzmagic game
Jags are ass wow
Jacksonville went for it on 4 and 6 in their territory with 1:20 in the half? bad play calling especially if you literally don’t have the offense to carry you down the field🤦🏽‍♂️
Great win for the Dolphins!
Who else picked up James Robinson before the season started???
At this moment the jags said we should probably start tanking lol...... Fitzpatrick just won't go away huh
Minshew got absolutely killed
why is playing fitzpatrick and not tua? i was really hiped by that pick
Both of these defenses are soo soft. Which is interesting because Jacksonvilles defense was so stout just a few years ago.
One positive is that James Robinson got me 30 points
Fitz-Brady! He’s...elite now?
I was at this game
As a sad jaguars fan I still have to say it.... DUUUVVALLLLL!. But in all seriousness the defense did not play well and the wr did not give Minshew and help. James Robinson is that truth tho. Good game dolphins
Fitz looking like Cam.
Who is number 42 of the jaguars he needs to chill and stop overshooting every gap
Facts
Last night there was a Fitzmagic show keep it up Miami. Go Dolphins🐬 #finsup #WeAreMiami 🤩✌🏼👍🏼🙏🏼🏈🙌🏼
On the drives where Jacksonville scored their receivers made amazing catches. I actually felt fine with that though cause I figured they wouldn't be able to do that all game
I quit my 9-5 with the help of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Cj looked so lazy 😔 come on Cj
If you lose to a team like miami browns you outright suck.
miami is showing is slowly getting better, once they put tua in there... it’s over
Wait so 10:59 wasn’t a pick?
I'm I the only one who misses the shorter highlight videos from a couple of years ago?
Man Joe Buck is a terrible game called
For everyone saying Dolphins are underestimated, I’ve been a Dolphins fan since birth, who’s trynna join me
When that cornerback didn't touch Grant after his first catch...  SMH... GO PHINS!!!
WAY TO GO DOLPHINS
They was doing gaskin dirty after the tackled him
8:14 so no one gonna talk about van noy poppin the running back lmaooo
5:03 all that comes to mind is Tony Baker “Kirk Paatrick!!” 🤦🏻‍♂️🤣
Dude I hate this new Fox format, change it back to the other one.
Jags couldn’t throw the deep ball
why cant the dolphins play like this all the time 😭 🐬💯
FITZMAGIC STRIKES AGAIN!!!
Miami looked like all-madden cpu on offense where fitzpatrick goes 25-26 4tds 0ints 148.4 passer rating
made a good call starting James Robinson on both my fantasy teams. 30.9 pts.
8:14 who else saw the linebacker pancake the running back
Fitzpatrick really showed up for this game, didn't he? Nevermind his girly running style :-)
I have to say Joe Buck truly makes for a joyless viewing experience lol.. im not a fan of either team, but its bad enough to not be able to go to the games 😂
Do not underestimate Miami Dolphins this year.  Miamis offense isnt bad at all. They have put up a combine total of 59 points on the board this past week.  I mean Miami has 3 really great receivers. Grant, Gesicki, Parker, and soon they will have Tua on the field.  This is what happens when the Miami defense shows up to the game.
Never in my life have I seen the dolphins 🐬 play a great game of football 🏈
Fitz-magic > Minshew Magic
Florida 😂 that's the fullest crowd I've seen all season so far
Bro why doesn't Tua play Fiztpratrick getting to old cuh
When your beard protects your helmet from damage
Interestingly, the final score are reverses of each other. Dolphins had 31 and Jags had 31 backwards
Miami should have beat New England too but the refs allowed the receivers to be held on every play and only called 3 holding/PI penalties including 2 non-calls that led to INTs and gave the Cheatriots 4 timeouts in the first half so they could score at the end of the first half.
Am I the only one that wants to watch tua play
The Dolphins look tough. I mean, they should have only lost by 7 or even 3 points to the Patriots, who are never easy to beat. Their second game was against the Bills, who are good. They're finally getting to play a bad team. Sorry, Jags fans, what I mean is not as good as the Bills and Patriots.
The Tank starts now idc I like Minshew but we have a shot at a generational talent franchise changing QB no more mediocrity #TankForTrevor
Fitzpatrick: Yeah, I think I'll try today...
Everyone was talking about minshew being so great and he just got his ass beat by the DOLPHINS
Bruh, Gesiki is such an undereated TE
lol “Minshew Mania” 😂😂😂
I did not watch Miami , they will not stand for the flag . If they in the locker room I will watch Fox News.
nobodys talking about 8:13 where the guy just gets leveled
Pass is........ caught  damn, who knew
Dolphins offensive is really good this year there defensive could get some improvements
Dolphins fans after the game.. we going to the Super Bowl 😂😂
Dolphins played great on both sides of the ball! All star Fitz in this game, even blocked downfield and caught a pass! Stay healthy and safe everyone
Why was I born a Jags fan? :(
Jaguars are pathetic
Devante Parker is legit I had no idea how good he actually was I knew he was good but to play like that through an injury was really impressive and he’s gonna get even better once he gets his explosiveness back
So we're not going to talk about Cam Robinson's ejection? I mean that was as petty as baseball's officiating.
13:47
That linebacker in safety for the Jag's look horrible out there,over pursuing, and at times no were near the play.
Fitzpatrick is the only qb still running to block
PASS IS CAUGHT!!!
Fitzpatrick really fun to watch
Chris Conley is garbage.
13:47 "sup bi*ch" lol
horrible play calling by jay gruden, too conservative didn’t put his players in a position to win
everyone was saying the jaguars were going to win... clearly miami shut everyone up
Welll okay that was a nice game by James Robinson but so far i am 0-1 this week
minshew is fake. anyone can be good while just throwing check downs
For a 3rd string back, Miles Gaskin is pretty good
I see Fitzception is back in Miami... Great... he looks great 1 Week and then Drops the ball next week
Ryan Fitzpatrick in 2020 season Week 1: FitzTragic Week 2: FitzMagic Week 3: FitzMagic To be continued
i knew the dolphins would win
I was one of the very few who knew the Dolphins were winning this
Probably the most boring game in nfl history
“Pain heals, chicks dig scars, glory lasts forever” -Shane Falco                        -Ryan Fitzpatrick
If Fitzpatrick could play like this every game, and not average 2 picks
There’s highlights from this game lol
Let’s go Robinson! Got me 24 fantasy points
Let's go my miami dolphins getting the win I really taught we were gonna choke this
The beard has lost his snappy arm, but his grit is still at 100%, love watching this guy play his heart out!
how
Minshu is garbage 🗑 😒 🙄 😑
Fitzpatrick for mvp
That almost pick that Minshew threw into quadruple coverage was pathetic. Thanks for getting me 9 fantasy points lol
🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬
it’s the Fitzmagic
Jags really miss Dj Clark . You know jags defense bad when Miami O line is dominating
I don't why fitzpatrick has been with several different NFL teams throughout his career... I've always thought fitzpatrick is a good starting NFL QB... last night game shows me Ryan fitzpatrick has always been under rated...fitz is the TRUTH in my opinion..GO STEELERS!!!
Under 46.5 home, Miami +3.5 home, Miami win home. God I`m good :)
Jags lost yay 😁 Titanup 🇺🇸🇭🇳
HEY EA SPORTS THE DLINE MEN NEVER STOPPED RUNNING WHEN HE BROKE THREW THE LINE FIX THE GAME
These NFL Highlight Videos are getting too long...this game should be summed up 5 minutes max.
8:12 the RB steps into the gap for the pass block and gets absolutely destroyed
I fr knew FitzMagic was gonna show up. Miami looked good in this game, good for them.
Jaguar fans were so confident they were saying “2-1 here we come”
Ugh. Joe Buck is back commentating
Im stil waiting for some tua time ....
I'm not a Miami fan, but I am a Fitzpatrick fan. Legend.
I would love if just once ole fitz could win it all just once. Just once.
Wow....
Miamis GM needs to be fired
As a Texans fan I hate BILL O’Brien 🤦🏾  Edit: this game has the Texans stench all over it 😭
nice suplex at 13:20
I see you Fitzy I see you Baby...Lets gooo Lets Gooo Baby
Anyone who's claim to fame is beating that Jacksonville team will be sitting in bleachers during super bowl.
Ryan Fitzpatrick plays with so much enthusiasm....You don't need 450 million to enjoy the game.
That oline is awful not even like they playing a good dline
#TankForTrevor
Those Teal 😍
Fitzmagic is back
I was goin for the Jaguars and they get beat by them glad Ian bet
Gardner "Hit the flats" Minshew
Love or Hate his inconsitancy you have to admit Fitzpatrick always gives everything he can to his team. He's out there throwing ACTUAL blocks on running plays, forcing himself through linemen to gain a yard and each throw has all the grunt he can put into it. Just seems his issue is mental/emotional, his throwing style is "older" with a longer action, slower release meaning DB's get more of an indication of where he's aiming, and he far too often tries too hard to force a play...that's his nature...he's trying with all he can. Maybe, IF, Miami now has a decent ground game and can give him some time to settle in games he won't try too hard.
Joe Buck is still the worst
I learned to love mr Fitzpatrick, funny guy
Ouch
As a jets fan, I love seeing Fitzpatrick go off. Defying all of the odds. Respect your elders Minschew!
That last gaskin run was beautiful! Way to seal it
Solomon Kindley looking great!
Myles Gaskin isn’t the best running back Miami has had but we do have a running that will get you that 4 or 5 yards when you need it
I dont watch american football so can someone explain why at 1:11 the defender started to clap instead of tackling
I’m a Bills fan but the Dolphins lowkey good and idk why
They really picked the jags to win lmao
I think Minshew is their guy for the future, and it's sad they're trying to tank for Trevor Lawrence. Dude is special, he can make plays.
Fitz should go to the hall frfr
How come the dolphins 🐬 won the game 🐆 were not good enough at all come on jaguars 🐆
Dolphins are looking good this year, record doesn’t reflect their potential   -Buffalo Fan
Keelan Cole is such a talented receiver... why not go to him more often? I don’t get it lol.
I was to lazy to turn on my TV so it just wait for youtube to give me the noti
If James Robison keeps this up, I think he has a chance for OROY in the AFC
What Happened to Gesicki?
Look at Fitzpatrick throwing himself around to get that block on the edge
Shame on the giant organization for failing to mention the attack on 911, while their team played football.We losr over2500 of our friends  and neighbors and 343 brave FDNY died trying to save them. This was in our city Shame on them
BeardMagic
Are we not gonna talk about this play at 00:16, I’ve never seen a quarterback actually try blocking in a game
Imagine getting smacked by the dolphins in your own crib...their literally a free lick team
Broooo Fitzpatrick looks GOOD
Imagine jakeem grant on the chiefs
Jaguars still the jags! It's downhill from here...
Tua better get comfortable on that bench if Fitzpatrick continues to play like this.
Whoever is in charge of the Jax Franchise is running that Organization into the ground.
Fitz has always been underrated to me
That dolphins D deserves allot of credit. They are looking better this year.
Good old fitzmagic Don't sleep on him he will get rolling for you for a hot 3or 4 games strong 💪 oh yeah don't act like y'all didn't see that block he threw on that play i wouldn't advise him to do that again but I like his guts .oh yeah I am a Buccaneers fan so I no 😁
❤️
0:20 NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT FITZMAGIC RUNNING IN FRONT OF THE RUNNER TO BLOCK??   this guy is incredible
Ok I’m a bills fan so some people may not kno this. THERE R TWO FITZPATRICK MODES. FITZMAGIC OR FITZTRAGIC. NO IN BETWEEN. HE EITHER PUTS UP 35 OR 7
Imagine losing to a team that has not made the playoffs in awhile
James Robinson🔥
Where is the Jacksonville defense at?? Shout out to #42 though
Great game
Jags are the most inconsistent team ever
1 Like = 1 "Passsssss is cawttttt" button
0:20 Fitzmagic block 👏
AFC championship game???
There’s only 3 things guaranteed in life: -Death -Taxes -Ryan Fitzpatrick destroying everyone’s predictions
James Robinson R16 RB my ass haha such a fantasy sleeper
0:24 !?
MIAMI SET!
When r they playing tua?
I can't stand Joe "pass isssssss cawwwwt" Buck
Minshew holds the ball way too long, missed a lot of reads too
lemme say something dolphins are my home team they have been my favorite since I knew nfl was a thing but this season when we became 0-2 y’all doubted the dolphins but when the dolphins get there chemistry to the best because we have a lot of rookies we will be that good team.
I wish they wouldn’t but the score on the thumbnail.
Sacksoville vs the tank
Stupid jag fans
Fitzpatrick still going strong 👏
0:19 we going to ignore Fitz going to block?
Minshew looks like he REALLY missed Chark in this game.  The Fins are playing leagues better than last year.  Those combined for a Fins win at JVille.  The Fins won't win it all but in their division they may just play spoiler.
Jags win the Tank Bowl!
5:43 Henderson just didn’t even try lol
I like how it says "Ulit takes all of us" in the end zone. So what does that mean? All of us matter?
8:14 Bruh... he just got rammed by a truck 😂
Very happy I picked up Jrob right after draft in fantasy.
Wow I have never seen such a play by a QB. What determination. 0:19
I have James Robinson in fantasy lets go
Go rams
wth happened here after the whistle lmao 0:22
Seahawks fan here, the best thing to watch in the nfl after Russell Wilson's dimes is seeing the dolphins players celebrate Ryan Fitzpatrick. Fun team.
Fitzception with a great game
I didn't realize minshew's completion percentage was so high because every pass was a check down... Man that was boring, I am used to watching josh allen with the bills, which is like a roller coaster ride.
Tua is gonna dominate that pistol offense
That feeling when you grab Robinson from waivers and start him🥶
Man Jags need a top round pick.
Damn dolphins looked good, can’t wait to see tua with that offence! Dolphins are in good hands!
This game was Gaskin Dolphins vs Jacksoville Jaguars
Lol.  The bandwagon was overloaded... and these Jags actually stink!
Yooo Fitzpatrick be actually trying to lay out safeties blocking  on some plays
There are pig squeals at 9:36
Not having DJ Chark in their offense tonight clearly hurt the Jags. They just couldn't get anything going on offense.
1:11 dude what were you thinking??
I think the Minshew hype train was derailed on MNF!
Back to back weeks of a mediocre team playing a bottom feeder on TNF
It can’t be... fitzmagic... he’s back
Minshew is playing like if Pat Mahomes played with one eye closed
#33 is gonna get killed in the film sessions for that lapse!
It's nice seeing Gesicki and Parker playing great these last 2 seasons. Seems like all they needed was a QB who would actually throw them the ball. Now if Williams can play like he did last year before the injury, Miami will have a top 10, maybe top 5 receiving core.
What an opening drive !
1:12 looks like a madden glitch
Minshew is trash
So Gaskins is the #1 Dolphins RB? Didn't see thst coming.....
Minshew or however u spell his name needs to get the ball down the field. Hes 35 for 50 with 80 yards lol
FITZ FCKNG PATRICK!!!!! <3
Jags are ass
Gardner Minshew needs to go back to where ever he came from. He was absolute garbage against a defense that is average at best.  Trashola.....Hes another Ryan Leaf. JUNK
When was Miami EVER a Top 5 defense?
Did I just see a sack on a four man rush against an entire O-line? What a bunch of bums!
AFC EAST is up for grabs with Brady gone and the Bill's & Dolphins are playing like it. Jets suck worse than before.
Dont know if it would benefit Tua learning the 50/50 style of Fitz..
Wow, Jaguars defense is literally pathetic. They won't be winning many games this year. Guess literally everyone was wrong about them, seeing as how 90% of the money for bets on this game was on the Jags.
Man in a few years miami will once again be elite hahaha
How the Jags beat Indy, played a close game against Tennessee but killed by the fins? 🤨🤔
as a Pats fan, Dolphins O-line, QB, and Gaskin totally lit up the Offense! .... not going to lie, starting to appreciate other teams and players with TB12 gone sadly.
The Thursday night games always a blowout
People are sleeping on the dolphins
The phins pass rushing is still atrocious
Why Fitzpatrick laying on his lineman like that after the draw td😂
70% people where sure in jags
I knew Dolphins gona win
I reacted to this on my channel & tbh idk anyone on these teams lol 😂
Miami's secondary is looking good!
But did any of you catch a fish???? or subs???
Jakeem Grant doe🔥🔥💪🏾👀
What a block by fitzpatrick at 0:21 haha
In a way it's refreshing to see the Dolphins play well
Fitzpatrick finally breaking out, NFL MVP 2020 . Chalk it up baby . Dolphins going to the Super Bowl
"Pass is caught"...
They missed chark in this game
Yo I am a saints fan but if we play the dolphins it is going to be a close game
Minshew Magic is a mere apprentice compared to Fitzmagic
So this just proves they both still suck.... lol
So many checkdowns from minshew, down 21 you gotta take some shots
When is tua gonna play?
Miles Gaskins out of the 206 babyyy
Joe Buck is unbearable. This was a decent game and he sucked all the energy out of it with his dry commentary. But maybe it's just me
Fitzmagic shows you why teams still want him.
Of course Fitz plays good when everyone wants to see Tua
Don't forget to hit that like  Thank's !
8:14 🥞
I swear I saw Fitz trucked a dude. Also he's out here rushing like he's a running lol
Man Jacksonville iono man..they show flashes that they could be very good at times..then they play like this an make it seem they are tanking for Lawrence
That gesceki dude that the dolphins got. They need to keep him he something serious. Devante Parker too.
Jacksonville seemed like they didn’t want to play
Ol' Fitzy running like he's 20 again!
Dolphins be having their QBs blocking lmao
I missed the Color rush jersey (sorry if my vocabulary is wrong) I don't speak English very well
Fins up 😤 been impressed with Gaskin looks a solid player and our defense has been really good, my fins are building something special 🤞🏼
I knew they was go lose the game just off the 1st quarter this man catches the ball n the db doesn’t touches him because he to busy clapping his hands for no apparent reason fun fact: the man is a captain too lmaooo 🤣
Fitzmagic>Minshewmania  Beard>mustache
Its honestly sad to see the jags go from title contender to dumpster fire. Minshew doesn't deserve this. The front office is horrible.
LOL @ all the people who put money down on Jacksonville.
easy pick 👌 made money off of Miami hot pick.. jags sucks... no magic from minshew
Minshew waiting too long in the pocket
Jaguars are going nowhere fast. Their trades generally suck and their more talented players are ready to get out of Dodge. They have  become a feeder club for other teams.
So glad I took the under
What was all this hype about Gardener he doesn’t even seem that good
14:55 I like how confident the Dolphins player looks thinking it was incomplete by Conley 14:55 XD
Acting chest beard
The Jaguars should give the game to Fitzpatrick they officially will never beat him
The dolphins 2 first games were kinda hard my Bills and the pats cam Josh and Fitzpatrick all have there moments josh has the weapons cam has the weapons the dolphins really only have Parker which is their best weapon the bills just got stefon diggs and pats got cam Newton but the dolphins don't have to many weapons the dolphins are slowly improving but they still need to draft some offensive and defensive weapons
"Pass is... Caught!" - How you know it's a Joe Buck play by play.
Minshew has been sacked 10 times in three games. They have to come up with a scheme where he can be successful. Like Carolina is learning with Bridgewater, a good QB is not going to shine in a system that does not showcase his talents. Bridgewater was great in New Orleans behind that stellar line. He goes to Carolina, a team that gave up 50 sacks last year, and they can't get anything going. Bridgewater has run for 460 yards in his 7 year career, the guy he replaced has run for 4,880 in his. Jay Gruden has no idea how to build a modern offense around a multiple threat QB. He proved that in Washington. They are going to squander Minshew if they are not careful.
I was able to watch this on my phone and well worth it.Go Fins.-Pittsburgh's #1 Dolphins fan
Tbh jaguars are ass
Dolphins fans exist
Jaguars #76 he needs to be fired
The Miami Dolphins get their first win of the 2020 season!!! Let's go Dolphins!!! Fins up!!! How bout them Dolphins in Miami!!!
Man it's so easy to forget that the Jags just straight up dont know how to tackle
When you put your last $500 on the dolphins ❤️❤️🙏
Since when did the dolphines get good👌👌🔥🔥😂😂😂
Dolphins scary this year.
I didn't know Principal O' Shack-Hennesy was playing.
Number 23 thought he was still in college 1:11 😂
Why are the Dolphins winning a game..
Can minshew hit a moving target?
11:21 synchronized hand wave
so we not gonna talk abt jags rb getting absolutely sat down at 8:10
they both only look good because they both suck lmao
First time Jags wear their new color rush uniforms.
Most boring game so far. And we have to suffer through Jets vs Broncos next Thursday. Who made the TNF schedule this year? I just wanna talk.
Conley dropped way too many footballs tonight...
The defender on the play at 14:54 LMAO
Why would they even put this on Thursday Night Football?  Two teams that suck and they are in the same region geographically.  There may be Dolphins fans scattered around the US because they have been around a long time, but Jacksonville is still an expansion team in most peoples minds. It seems like the NFL would want to put marquee matchups in this slot since it's the only game of the day and the start of the new week.  Having said that, it looks like Fitzmagic did his early season thing again, and good for him.
1 question not about the game. Bro Dolphins aren't able to celebrate td's😂 btw it was a better game than I thought it will be by looking at the names of the teams😅
Jags number 42 is dirty. He body slammed the runner after play was over, and almost did it again with a player out of bounds. This is not right.
So glad I picked up Robinson in both my redraft and dynasty leagues
No matter where you play in Florida Dolphins have home field advantage
No one going to mention Fitzmagic out there running block?
Fitzpatrick: The best worst quarterback of all time
Good job coach Flores, the Dolphins are night and day different than last year.
Go phins 🐬🐬💪
In my pro football pickem group I switched and picked the Dolphins last second. I had a feeling they would win. I went back and looked at highlights of their past 2 games, specifically vs the Bills. The bills have Diggs, Beasley and John Brown, yet the Dolphins did well against them. Logic told me the Jags aren't as talented on offense and defense than the Bills and the Dolphins previous 2 games were close.
keep playing like that Dolphins, and you might win the SB
Feel bad for Gardner. Dudes a legit QB but they are gonna replace him instead of build around him.
to be honest no one expected this outcome
Didn't realize Hulu didn't have NFL network. Maybe ratings are down for all sports/ NFL because NFL games aren't available on all platforms and it's hard to track Nielsen ratings on the various apps people watch sports on.
I can feel the pain : minshu
Fins are lookin up
Born and raised Buffalo New York Die Hard Bills fan since 1983 Ryan Fitzpatrick has the Heart of a Lion we still love him so much here in Buffalo we were sad to see him go.     He made football exciting he was the last quarterback to beat Tom Brady for the bills I wish the guy all the best I'll always root for him it would be much more easier to do so if he wasn't for the Dolphins LOL
Bruh just listen to the players 😂😂
As a jags and minshew fan, I really hope he goes to a better team in the future. He is way to talented to be stuck on this team....
First game of the year called by Joe Buck that I caught...took exactly 3 seconds for a "pass is........caught." Seriously that line is about 80% of this video. Fun game but so desperate for Buck and Aikman to be replaced.
Fool started clapping an almost just gave a touchdown up 🤣🤣
:24 so you can tackle a guy twice now without any penalty? How was that not a personal foul?
#23 needed to be benched after that catch. Really with the 👏👏
Trash
Can someone explain to me what happens at 1:13... Why is he able to continue? Thank you guys.
Can we talk about how Kyle Van Noy deleted his blocker at 8:10 😂
Now THAT is how you prove yourself. Everyone was saying Jags would win by 2 scores. Go Phins!!🐬up!!
I feel bad for Gardner Minshew. Hopefully he gets picked up by a real team in the future.
Great bounceback win for the fins. Tho I can't believe Gesicki only finished with that one catch.
Fitzpatrick best running back of NFL change my mind 😉
If only Cam could’ve run it in like Fitzpatrick did to win us the game
Minschew placeholder for qb1 of jags who ever been saying he accurate long term answer need to stop reading the boxscore for their info. Use ya eyes
Robinson put up 30 for me lets go
I was hyped after the first game for my Jags, and encouraged after the loss at Tennessee on Sunday. But, it’s going to be another long season if we can’t contend with Ryan Fitzpatrick.
Minshew is terrible. Nothing but check downs, anytime he throws a deep ball it’s picked off
FITZMAGIC!!! now if the Dolphins can win... I hope that my Eagles can win at least against the Bengals on Sunday :D
This will go down as the most irrelevant game this season
2:56 Inside the Tampa five
Fitzmagic is back
Nobody: Absolutely nobody: Joe Buck: Pass is ... caught.
0:51 watch the jags player punch the ball after the play is well over. he even lines up the punch slowly. lmao #44 is wild
UrinatingTree: *Confused screaming*
So the Lolphins are ruining their carefully constructed tank for the second year in a row...
Jacksonville ownership still doesn't realize their biggest problem is the head coach.
I'm not experienced enough to make this call, but the Jags' play calling was...questionable.  Aside from that Miami looked really good. Though Minshew didn't have his main weapon, Fitzmagic balled out and the defence did too. And the Dolphins have a run game.
Can someone explain, I didn‘t quite get it. Is the pass ..... caught?
Jags trash
I’m never betting when fitz is playing, most unpredictable player.
Sadly this is considered a win for Jags management
Dolphins prove the haters wrong 😎😎😎😎😎
man the fins just took their lunch money.  thing is fitz is a pretty good qb in games where doesnt throw 4 interceptions casually.
if Grant made the TD after the 1:19 catch wow  CJ Henderson would be out of a job
dolphins lookin good cant even cap
Jaguars uniforms are so trash lmao. Only teams with no pants stripes. Some practice squad looking shits 😂
Started fitz in one of my leagues tonight no big deal
Dam Robinson
Lol that corner thought he did something🤣
bet they wishin they kept nick foles now
Tua. Just put him in.
Turtle derby game. Who was worse?
That definitely should’ve been a first down for jax in the 4th
Our O-Line and defense is embarrassing
dolphins are a dark horse team this year
Run it with gaskin more
8:14 Van Noy blew that dude upppppp!!!!
CJ was having a hard time
this was a pre-season game with two sorry qb's
11:29-11:30 "wow that was a gift wrap right there" 🏈
Never seen dolphins play so well
The jags qb holds the ball way to long
This is when Jacksonville Remembers their prized tank
226 of the dislikes are because of Joe Buck!
Miami has the worst people in a city. The worst sportsmanship in their teams. And the worst politicians in the state which is really saying something. Genuinely hate everything about that city
Looks like Bortles never left
Saludos tocheros dé México Edo MEX Muuuy buueenna victoria espero que sea la primera de muchas. DELFiiiiiiiNEEEEEEssdds
AFC East:at least we don't have to worry about Tom Brady anymore😣😓
1:11 Jaguars playing pop warner out there 😂
I can’t stop watching 8:14. He got run over.
10:38 thats what im talking about 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Super bowl came early this year bois
Minshew mania is officially over
13:41 😂
Passs isssss....... caught.
James Robinson is a BEAST
A “little” toss to Grant😂
Is it me or are these highlights not put together as well as they used to be. Many repeat highlight plays, end of plays cut off, continuity is off, etc.
Big win for the Dolphins.
I can’t call this NFL football
Robinson’s a stud
Jacksonville traded away there whole defense lol
Contracts to baby buck your dad is very happy in the heavily world.
These highlights were too long
This dude started clapping 😂💀😂 1:11
God I hate this commentary duo
Dolphin defense was hitting hard tonight. Impressive.
Damn with matchups like this it’s no wonder I forgot Thursday’s are football days.
90% of this video is Joe Buck saying "Pass is..Caught"
Bears fan right here but I have to admit that those 2 uniforms of Jacksonville and Miami are damn beautiful.
What the hell is Jacksonville doing in this game?! Good job Miami yall are finally winning!
Dolphins play good football tonight.
Never seen easier money than the dolphins +3
TNF is where they show all the games nobody wanna watch right? I mean, Brown v. Bengals, Dolphins v Jags, and next week we got Jets v Broncos...
Wow
Congratulations to dolphins but it's just their first win like woe
Watching this was like watching my local JV teams play.
Chris Conley was not making things easy for Jacksonville considering he plays for that team.
Were the dolphins that good or the jaguars just bad?
I think it's obvious which team studied the other team harder.  Miami had Jacksonville read like a book. O,o
Miami defense gne be a problem
Cam Robison is a friggin stud
神様仏様フィッパトリック様
0:22 how is that not a flag?
I would say the dolphins looked good because it’s the jags but this didn’t look like a game with 2 bad teams. Dolphins looked good. They executed well. Jags actually didn’t play terrible. Just some costly mistakes that ended drives and they probably should have gave Robinson the ball a lot more
CJ Henderson, 23, Cornerback for Jags, is absolute trash. Just look at how bad he gets burnt multiple times and how disinterested he is all game.
Offensive coordinator for the jaguars needs to be fired.
Great win!
Damn he said, "Miami set hut!"
Anyone else get completely crushed in fantasy by James Robinson... good god
Fitzpatrick one game wonder
worst jags performance
Brandon Jones loooking like a steal in the third round
What about my boy TUA
After a pretty decent Cincinnati-Cleveland match up, back to the usual Thursday night suckage.
they got destroyed bye a 0-2 team that’s unbelievable to me because i was for sure that the jaguars were going to win.
Shouldve played tua
Feels like this highlight clip should really only go for 5 min
Listen to 13:48 😂💯
I put  money on Jax and then they decide to stink up the joint
Hahahahahaha
Now That's wtf I'm talking about! Straight dominated them boy's. And Fitz is supposed to always play like this..shiiiid! He been in the league for 15fkn years.
Yo somebody needs to slap 83 on the jags defense with a fart scented waffle for forgetting to touch the receiver. That's literally defense 101.
Si te importa más el dinero que la vida de los jóvenes o solo opinas igual q los paleros de las transnacionales  .      Compra tu ... no envenenes a los niños .
8:13😭😭😭
Jaguars didn’t look to bad..the offensive calls were mostly under 10 yards..both teams looked good..just little mistakes
Fitzpatrick looked good tbh
14:54 That's embarrassing for the DB to celebrate an incompletion. He did redeem himself with an interception the next play.
1.11 why was the jax cornerback applauding after not touching the receiver Lol he should not play again.
8:11 53 from Miami lit up the running back
Fitzmagic outdoes Minshewmania
Jags play calling is terrible, if I see another 2yrd pass from the Jags I’m done watching them play.
I'm disappointed that they didn't say O Shag Hennessy when O'Shaughnessy caught the ball for the Jaguars..
Dolphins lack of pass rush scares meee, the run defense still an issue and Bobby McCain be late to everything as a deep safety gettin blown by receivers.. I just hope they all improve and Myles Gaskin been a surprise I really thought he was gettin cut this year
8:13 bro got mollied
Everybody gets to b 1-2 !! Ayy
Dude jags #42 needs to chill
13:48 lmao
I just.. this game was just
1:11 😂😂😂
Gruden with the safe play calling
I feel so bad for defensive players. They are not allowed to tackle so the constantly get run over and embarrassed. They are not allowed to cover so the get beat constantly and then talked trash to. It's really sad
Nick foles
Gaskin and Devanta Parker were balling
Fitzmagic... But will it last this season? Also Cole has some hands and catching diamonds to drop! Remember that one hander a season or two ago?
I thought the jaguars was going to win this game, I guess week 1 was a fluke.
Minshew's hindering this offense from being great. He cant play so lack luster in this league.
Rip to my fantasy team. Thanks Uncle Rico
Is Dolphins D is showing up or Jags have a crappy line??q Hope Dolphins can sustain it...
Minshew is overrated and overhyped. Also, the Jaguars still suck. TitansUP.
Bruh you telling me that -dolphins>jaguars>colts>vikings
Jags qb is looking like Drew Brees... throwing nothing but check downs. I can say it because I'm a saints fan.
I guess gesicki will be unpredictable
Anyone else noticing a lot of late hits the refs are letting go.... I’m not complaining I’m just saying definitely seems that way
13:04 Fitzpatrick pulls a Mariota and catches his own pass.
Anyone else noticing a lot of late hits the refs are letting go.... I’m not complaining I’m just saying definitely seems that way
Joe Suck. I mean Buck.
Either the Jags O-line is horrible or the QB
As a Giants fan it's kinda sad watching these teams oline just blocking so well😭😭😭🚫🧢
Its official : Mohawk > braids > beard > mustache
And at 1:10 i like how you can hear someone say touch him while the guy claps
Jaguars need a QB asap, one hit  he get happy feet. He can't read a defense. I say by week 5 deer in headlights.
I still dont understand what made Wingard throw him again in the first couple seconds of the video.
james robison putting on in fantasy
Yuh my replacement for Barkley
Kyle van noy DESTROYED the rb @8:14
Jags going back to tanking
Damn... now I see why the Jags cut Leonard Fournette.
How many times you gonna do a short pass, Jacksonville? Trying to watch an interesting game here but the most interesting part was how many times you got intercepted from passing beyond the 3-4 yard mark.
8:13
No deep threat at all for the jags.
And the Crowd Noise goes wild!  The cool thing about very little crowd noise is that you can REALLY hear the hits.
I might be crazy but Van Noy doesn’t look worth his money. Tackles look bad or nonexistent.
GG jags, Robinson is like another Jones Drew!! #FinsUp
Umm I know i havnt played legit ball in a few years but flag? 0:22
The toilet bowl
Either Miami's D is top notch or the jags  O-line sucks taint...going with the latter
Minshew looked like Alex Smith tonight. Dump off, dump off, dump off. HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY. WHAT'S THE POINT IN CONTROLLING THE CLOCK WHEN YOU ARE LOSING.
I've always liked Fitzpatrick! He's a great QB that's been on some bad teams, and he's had some injury problems but when he's healthy, he's always been a beast. Miami's front 7 is looking real nice like this year too. Hope they can make some noise. It's long overdue.
Man, that was boring
Dolphins strategized together , an played really good ! Hoping Fitzpatrick may remain health throughout the season
Jags ain't out, Dolphins are better than people gave them credit for.  I felt the the Dolphins were going to be the real surprise team this year, and just cuz you start 0-2 don't really mean sheet.  Well played Fins, Go Jags!
Anyone see that RB on Jacksonville side get blown up trying to block #53 around 8:13. Just me???? 😳😳😳
8:12 RB got laid the hell out
1:12 someone’s getting cut tomorrow.
8:11 That rb is destroyed 😂
I'm so disappointed the Dolphins didn't sub in Tua Tagovailoa in the 3rd/4th quarters
These dolphins put up a good game they just needa get stronger that Jacksonville running back went through them easily alote they needa work very hard
Jags really made the Dolphins look like the Chiefs
Fun Fact# Both teams allowed all their fans to attend
11:03 did they review that play during the actual game? Looks like the ball clearly comes out of his hands and hits the ground.  You can see it at full speed and if you slow the speed down it becomes even more obvious.  Not that it likely would have mattered.  But still, was kind of surprised that counted as an INT when even upon first viewing at full speed it looked like a drop.
How the hell is Joe Buck still employed?  The most boring commentator in the NFL.  A literal crab would more animated with his descriptions.
1:10 Me-33 Single mothers-19 You simps-42
Dolphins Defense has some dawgs
Fitzpatrick plays like Dan Marino once every two months.
Old fashioned ass whooping
They both suck
What a piece of crap those jaguars they only know how lose and lose, they can't even win 5 games straight. Just disappointed 😞
omg the pass protection at 8:11
Minshew = Garbage
Both Teams going NOWHERE!💩
Good job n good game for both team..
Didn’t know football was on Thursdays also
1:12.. add this to the not knowing the rules of football highlights.
Fitzmagic it’s awesome when he wants to be... to bad he is so inconsistent... he could of been so great.  And I feel bad for Garner he’s a talented QB i wish he had better talent around him, it’s so unfair that the team is wasting him. He could go to a better team like Chicago, Cleveland , New Orleans, Atlanta , Indianapolis teams that have talent and might need a QB soon.
James Robinson is a beast💪🏽
The battle for 2021 no 1 Nfl draft
No Chark doesn't help, but when you see a tackling attempt like that at 2:40, it's going to be a long night on defense
Minshew and Robinson need some help. They're playing well. Receivers need to play better.
Im pissed off at&t took away nfl network
Alriiiiiiight Miami!
Only 13 points against the dolphins? Doug marone needs to be fired. Should have been fired 2 years ago.
Dolphins d looking great out there
Now THIS was the Jaguars we expected to see! 😀😜😝😀
42 playin dirty
Thanks Robinson. Waiver wire steal!
Did anyone else find the score 31-13 satisfying or is that just me? 😅
No one is gonna talk about number 33 just clapping and letting Miami go.
How does a tank match end up being an upset
0:24 How the hell wasn't that a flag?????????
Dolphins Offense looks great.  I wish I could Say the same for My Jets😞
1:11 madden glitch, dude cheering the wrong team lol...
1:11  “That’s a Nooooob move”
Fitzmajic 😍😍😍
1-2 feels alot better than 1-7
Jags D had so many holes they're now known collectively as eDam......
Pick up James Robinson in your fantasy team right now dude
14:55 - 15:00 #25 what a moron...HAHAHAHA!!!
If you are reading this comment:  💕BE BLESSED!!!   x1,000,000💕🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🌎✨💞💫✨✨💞💫🌎✨💞💫💞💞🌎✨💞💫
Not sure how you spell his name but that dude Shinault?Looks like he loves life in slow motion
Ain't but three (3) AFC teams dat's gon' do damage: Baltimore, Kansas City and New England.  All da rest ain't gon' do diddly-poop lol
Does gardner ever throw the ball downfield?
Fitz is really loved by his teammates. Happy to watch him keep on playing
Minshew is always fun to watch, and Robinson looks like a beast too, but Jesus that’s one boring looking offense.
Beard is greater
1:09 lol
Can the Dolphins start a win streak is the question.
9:05 😂😂😂
Cashew is garbage
Got a good chuckle out of that 13:48
I wanted the jaga to win just to see minshew single handedly ruin the tank :(
Jags were way too hyped up. Miami showed up and dominated. Can’t underestimate fitz magic
Gaskin is a Washington boy!
Fitzpatrick is better than people think he has been consistent no matter ware he played.
Robinson turned out to be a hidden gem for the jaguars. Plays like a superstar
The Beard beats the Mustache
Florida teams are unpredictable and bipolar
I’m a Bills fan but the Dolphins deserve a lot more credit, they’re so underrated this year.
I just realized that fitzpatrick is minshew in 10 years. They have a similar play style. They are both none for magic abilities but cant (wont be able to) find a steady home because they arent a true franchise qb. Both have none facial hair. Size, type of qb. Running ability.
0:24 why tf did he throw him
Todays game is called by HOFer Joe Pass Is Caught Buck.
Some of the play calls from the Jags are head scratchers
Is that Fitzpatrick throwing a block at 0:17 ? Not even the typical half-assed QB block, but a real throw-yourself-fullspeed-at-the-defender kind of block! Damn...
Everybody was on the jags when they beat the colts but remember we didn’t have a preseason an the jags play the colts twice a year they normally Split the games. Jags are a bad team
Did the Jags miss the extra point or go for two and fail?
What happened to that Dolphin O-line?! Holy smokes they went from worst in the league to total domination in one week. Superb run blocking, excellent pass protection. This line gelled tonight. If this foreshadows what's to come the Pats and Bills the AFC-east could be like the wilds west. The AFC-west is shaping up similarly. The Raiders are hot, as are the Chiefs and Chargers(providing QB1 lives up to QB2's example). New crop of QB's is exactly what the NFL needed. Now let's see how Belechick fairs when facing a tough schedule yr after yr. As opposed to the last 20 years of 6 gimme games every season. Hurray for the DOLPHINS!!
Tuna can 🐬 aint going to the SB
Who pissed in wingard’s wheaties
what's up with Jordan howard?
Now we are fitz haters at that wanted tua in lmao
Shenoult is special
As a Jets fan I miss Fitzmagic I’m happy for him in Miami
Its tua time Fitzy: hold my beard
8:13 get that running back the number on that truck 😳😳😳
Love the commentary About Dan The Man Being there..Dudes right he was my favorite to watch also...Phins after this coming off season will be on of the best teams I'm the league.  Like what there doing down there
Fitzmagic usually lasts for 4-5 weeks.
A 5 yard run with no broken tackles is not a highlight lol this video could’ve been 8 minutes long
🐬🆙
Is it me or were the dolphins playing angry
I don’t like how they don’t show what the penalties were. They used to in the past, why did they stop?
It’s painful to watch Minshew get sacked. Get that talent out of Jacksonville and get Gardner some proper help.
Watch, next week Fitz will be 10/45 with 3 picks
@3:18 listen to #66 for the dolphins 😂
O O O Its magic ...u know!!!
Uh oh Jaguars starting to Jag
9:01 what a punt!
Fitzpatrick needed this win would've cuz if he would've had  a bad game Tua would be starting next week.
we jus gon ignore the penalty that should’ve been called😂
Bro, check downs is all Gardener can do. Whenever he tried to throw more than 10 yards it looked terrible!
MIAMI doing BIG things this week!   Lets go HEAT!
Jags fans after 1 win in the NFL: we could take down the Roman Empire with our defense alone. Superbowl, here we come. The new dynasty.
I don't know how they beat the Colts.
I don’t think The Jags will tank for Lawrence (The Jets will) but depending on the rest of the season they might for Fields.
The coaching for the Jaguars was horrible this game.
14:55 is some Madden BS where the animation plays for the pass breakup no matter what actually happened
Broncos and jets next week. 😪😪😪
The Lumberjack beard 🧔 vs The Pornstache 👨‍🦰
Mitshew> jameis Winston
Go Dolphins!!!
Dolphins beat they ass
Not a dolphins fan, but 9:57 is a pretty wholesome celebration
That dude Howard doe
Mustache cost me $50 😭😭
Devante Parker and James Robinson is very Underrated imagine in a couple of years
Say what you qant atleast fitz can throw for more than 5 yards unlike some over hyped saints qb
I would’ve bus driver uppercut numer 42 if he threw me like that after a play
12:54 “full head asteam”
👏 Wow! Fitzpatrick is playing good and Dolphins have a good running game. The D looks good also. I can't believe it! Maybe 👀 we are actually getting our sh....t together finally 🙌 in Miami!
Tough Decision could use advice... Full PPR  Diggs, Dionte Johnson, Fournette, Woods, Gage, Corey Davis, Josh Kelly. NEED 2 to play
I found out AEW superstar Sammy Guevara got RKOed by the Jaguars Mascot during this game lol
#23 Jaguars... WTF ARE YOU DOING?!?! The coaches must’ve chewed his head off for that one. 1:10 - 1:15.
Pass...is.........caught
Are we really doing this thing where Ryan Fitzpatrick pretends to be good AGAIN?
I thought minshew was better hes trash
“8:13” Robinson gets smack ! Hard by Dolphin LB, Sheesh !
*Fear the beard*
Beard > Mustache
I don’t even know why am in this comment section or watching this video this game sucks
Look I know I'm not exactly delivering a hot take here but Joe Buck and Troy Aikman are so gahtdam boring.
i knew we had this game we should've threw Tua in there
Wtf Yagwires? I was beginning to believe in Minshew Mania.
I give Fitzpatrick the upmost respect QB than other QB in the league. Im a Steelers fan Fitzpatrick will help his players block whoever has the ball in his hands so they can get pickup more yardage. I know he's not a big name like Brady, Roethlisberger but I would like to see him in the Hall Of Fame.
Miami's D looked great, one comment, when you're 0-2 don't over celebrate your first TD too much.
Safe to say the dolphins aren’t actually a bad team and all the people hating on my bills can stop saying iTs jUst tHe doLphIns
Jags didnt look like they wanted to be there
Andrew Wingard seemed like he had some bad blood against the Dolphins tonight.
Drug test the dolphins lol
Finally...
Had to watch this on mute just because of Joe Suck...
number 42 for the jags is kinda bad
nice video! :D
Minshew had a horrible game but in the end it was just one game, now everyone forgets everything he has done agianst the Titans and the colts and point at Trevor Lawrence or Justin Fields, I mean its just one game give the man a break
When the Dolphins actually do something like make the playoffs or maybe win a playoff game I'll get excited. Thankfully, we had the Heat win some championships and have a good squad right now.
stupid ass commentators.  this isnt a new normal you brainwashed lib
00:30  Illegal Hands to the Face, Offense, #77
13:43
The Jacksonville Jaguars organization makes me sick. They've been on a feedback loop since their inception in the mid 1990's; Total dogshit for 7-10 years, a promising 9-7 year, followed by a deep playoff run that has the whole world believing, instantly back to dogshit the next year, repeat...
Just when I thought we might be decent it ends up being same old Jags ):
Touchdown!  O'Shaq Hennessey!!
Tbh I think that Robinson is legit a fullback with the speed of a halfback like 13:01 HIS ARMS ARE BUFF AND HE BOUNCES OFF TACKLES LIKE THEY’RE NOTHING    change my mind that Robinson isn’t a fullback with the speed of a halfback
Is anyone gonna talk about the Jacksonville uniforms?🔥
As a dolphins fan , who attended this game. I was In SHOCK of how we moved the ball
FIRE TODD
The Jaguars actually just got fitception
It’s not the mustache it’s the receivers and the tightend
Prime Time Dolphins!!! #PhinsUp!!
Gaskin 🔥🔥🔥
Jrob is insane
I have never understood Fitz. Why can't he be consistent?  I wish he would play like this every week. I would like to see the dolphins compete again.
Fitzpatrick the type of guy to be fitzmagic once in a while
Fitzmagic looking really pretty with those zippy throws!
Can we all appreciate that 37yo Ryan Fitzpatrick was behind the line of scrimmage, ran past his running back and became his lead blocker?  0:15
0:20 is actually one of the better QB blocks I've seen
Battle of the Ugly Uniforms.
Gaskin was awesome for UW glad he's doing well
Dolphins went crazy today glad to see it honestly
Idk who tf that is but on the jaguars with the long hair is a great tackler
Congratulations Dolphins..... GO PACK GO
That boy James Robinson is the truth!!
Fitzpatrick a second ballet hall of famer!
gardner minshew can throw but when the pocket collapses he tends to make stupid passes like alomost 3 interceprtion yo
Bet the Jags are really missing Nick Foles right now. Chicago thanks you.  Good luck fighting the Jets for Trevor Lawrence.
Tuff game
Fitzpatrick dont wanna miss any passes this game -- so he caught his own blocked pass...... Bruh Moment
I WISH THE EAGLES 🦅 HAD JAMES ROBINSON GOOD RUNNBACK💪🏽🏈
Go Miami dolphins number one
Looks like Fitzmagic beats Minshew Magic.
Wow Ryan Fitzpatrick did a pretty good job tonight!!! Props. Robinson with Jacksonville was impressive as well.
Its hella obvious steve Smith either hella drunk or hella high.....be a pro dawg
Yo why is no one talking about the terrible ejection that ref was all over him come on NFL
I call Fitzpatrick "the American roulette" you never know if you're gonna get FitzMagic or FitzTragic lmao
That ejection was so unnecessary. Refs ruining games again.
Man minshew has such a bad arm
23 missed holding penalties on the dolphins O-Line
The jags defense throw so many late hits for no reason.
Hard to win games when every pass is a checkdown behind the sticks. Miami played a good game just like they did with us in Buffalo. Both our teams are on the rise. Happy for Fitz. Tua will have to wait another week, I think.
The fake crowd noise is really more obvious here. Every time the Jags make a first down, it’s like someone just turns on a hair dryer.
The 3 dudes that caught passes from Minshew tonight are gonna wake up tomorrow with bruises from head to toe.
I messed real bad when I said Jags are going to win this game...
Jaguars won one game and were like," oh yeag we're supposed to be tanking"
I like the double color scheme going on, the Jaguar colors go great with the dolphin ones
That was sure a shocker I picked Jacksonville to win that game
Dolphins 🐬 are the best NFL team in Florida 🏝 rn
James Robinson had a good game.
Fins UP BABY LETS GO 🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬🐬
Great performance & outstanding offensive, defensive, & special teams effort! It was a total team W! Good to see Fitz having fun out there. How about the young offensive line, making holes & giving Fitz plenty of time to find the open target. It is an exciting time to be a Dolphins fan all over again. It's been a long time since South Florida has seen Dolphins Football. Coach Flores & the entire front office are definitely taking this team in the right direction! The future is BRIGHT in sunny S. FLA.!!!  GO Dolphins!!!
Games like this that makes me happy cam wit to the patriots
Wish Cowboys had a real QB like Fitzmagic
My uso tua gonna be learning a lot from a fitzpatrick,Tua gonna be a good qb when he starts
The one time I put Minshew over Deshaun...
Is anyone going to talk about the D line ment at 8:11 that absolutely laid out the RB
1:12 that’s how all the madden games are nowadays!
Great game! Just kidding.
Shoulda ran the ball more. Robinson seems legit. Ran very effectively
Minshew fanboys real quiet rn
1:12 sums up 2020 for me
Dont ever bet against fitzmagic on a Thursday night
Joe Buck is god awful. Only he can make a good football game seem boring.

Oline played great, we got some big young guys, they look....big.
Oh jacksonville why do you keep breaking my heart. Will I ever get a Superbowl winning team out of you.
Bruh
a moment of silence for James Robinson at 8:12
Fitzpatrick is with a new team very season and yet when he is on a roll...he just owns it! ....Too bad he can't do it consistently...
Can’t wait for the next episode of gridiron heights fitzmagic 😂😂
Tonight the beard was more mightier than the mustache
Hey guys what's better than Minshew Magic?   FitzMagic. 🤣
Lol, no wonder Jacksonville Jaguars are the laughingstock of the NFL.   What a snoozer.
Is that Joe Tessitore of Holey Miley fame??
The beard wins
I lost a fair bit of money tonight
That is not the jags that played such a nail baiter on Sunday. Officiating was questionable. But the fire just wasnt there. Cant believe we got blown out by the dolphins.
Everyone slept on the dolphins 🤣
Play Minshew they said. You won’t regret it they said. You’ll more likely win with Minshew rather than Watson they said.
Nobody gonna mention that freight train pass rush at 8:12?
this was the first week i started minshew.  I'm sorry Jags fans.
Okay time to go 1 and 15
What? Dolphins are actually looking good...
Feel like this happens every year, jags start off good, everyone is hyped and then they TANK
I went to odea high-school with Gaskin so awesome to see him killing it in the nfl great guy
13:49 “Sup B****” haha
Time to shave my mustache and grow a beard
Minshew refuses to throw the ball 20+. Noodle arm
Jags were awful tonight.
Its funny watching everyone else get to play ball, but God if Edelman got hit like that they call targeting every time. Same for how they hit  Gardner, maholms would get "like he normally does" every sack taken away and given 15 yards cause it was too rough.
Can anyone explain why 1:12 that he can keep pushing forward? I'm a newbie. Thanks
All four commentators picked Jags to have the 30’s as the final score not the Dolphins. That’s how much they think they know. LOL
if fitzpatrick was fitzmagic every single game, he would be a incredible, elite quarterback. but he has the fitztragic doppelganger side which is hes downfall. interesting player. for the jaguars i have no idea what they are trying to do besides maybe tank.
Go bills
Looks like the jags payed the refs tonight
one of the worse NFL game I ever watch
Dolphines are being underrated this season
Bro can y'all pls bring back.mnf football watch party
Anybody see the rb get obliterated at 8:14 👀
Jags better switch QBs
14:55 love how Xavien Howard thinks he broke the pass up, and confidently signals incomplete....but then gets a pick on the next play. 😂
Good, now all the Jags fans can shut up about Minshew & why we shouldn’t sleep on the Jags. They suck lol but Robinson is a beast
12:51 pretty much heard someone hurl.
0:23 is it me or is the Rrefs relax this season? Should’ve been a UC flag
Be honest, who really enjoyed watching this game 😐
The Jags appear to be on their way to drafting Justin Fields or Trevor Lawrence.
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwqhKMM_hkGKzEQC3s69IrQ 💚💚💚
what a game for Dolphins
Dolphins came through and proved jags hypers were dreaming
CJ Henderson Is Giving Up Lol
Minshew is garbage
Who else got JAMES RB1SON on their fantasy team? 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
The things our man Fitzmagic does year after year with NO team around him is crazy. Say whatever you want Fitzpatty cakes is top 10.
So happy for Fitzpatrick when he does well the NFL just seems like a better place.
Fitzthanos top NFL qb once again
Yea for our side Fin Fan for ever
10:02 sus
And paass is caught good catch good throw.  Classic Joe Buck.
Mishew cost the game bruh
#PhinsUp
I still want tua
I thought this would be easy victory for Jags  but Dolphins showed up Minshew still got to grow I think the jaguars can win 5 games at least they doing good despite tanking
Minshew didn't do well this game because Fitzpatrick took all the magic.
I love seeing Fitzmagic making plays and his teammates celebrating with him.
Go BILLS
Fins Up baby🐬
Everybody was saying easy -3 jags
I knew they would win
So we're not going to talk about the RB being destroyed on that attempted block @ 8:13? Holy smokes...
Honestly the pathers QB looks really good. The team needs work for sure but he looks like he can stay lol
sec 23. nobody noticed???????//FLAG???????
That stat at the end tho...  damn
Dude these teams do not like each other
ฆวย เสือบ้าไรแพ้โลมา
The Dolphins players didn't  go to the strip club last night.
We all just going to ignore 8:12?
James Robinson with plenty of highlite runs in his young NFL career. Stay hungry, stay healthy and stay humble young fella! You deserve every yard.
Did anyone actually watch this game?
Robinson ain't chit
the dolphins still got work to do but you can see some progress tbh
Announcers: Tight-end O'Shaghenessy My brain: Principal O-Shag-Henessy!
Patrick was blocking 😂😂😂
Joe "and a nice cutback" Buck
Thank you Fitzpatrick for being the good version of you and getting me some good fantasy points
miami dolphins can f to h
0:15 Fitzpatrick went out there and blocked for his back. Gotta respect that
The eagles and Jacksonville tanking for #1 pick????
1:11 whats he doing? :D clap for the good catch?
the Seahawks should be worried next week .........
Let's just say tua is taking notes.
Next week is gonna be a barn burner. The pathetic Jets and a beat up Broncos team with Jeff Driskel.
These "highlights" videos editing is trash!!!!
5 takeaways from this game:  1.Jacksonville showed it’s true color, they were still on rebuild mode this whole time even with the good first 2 weeks of play, this game just showed it 2.Robinson is a underrated back  3.Minshew is clearly not the guy, he’s good for a few games then sucks, #TankForTrevor in full commission  4.Dolphins are going to be a really good team next year if they develop Tua properly 5.Thursday Night Games are ass (3 weeks in a row for aids game of the week after Broncos&Jets next week)
I wonder if Fitzmagick is disrespectful, after all he’s done.
Dolphins...👎👎👎
#Finsup
8:14 ..... That boy got popped 😂
Laviska will be one of the greatest
Whats come next???  Bengals vs lions sunday night football 😂
anyone else see that jaguar rb get rocked  8:14
1:10 felt like I was playing madden
I love Minshew's swag, but watching this he might have the WORST footwork of any QB in the NFL right now. So many throws off of the back foot, with both feet planted, with his upper body swiveling... I get adjusting an arm angle to beat a defender but this was just on routine throws! Does his QB coach not see that on film? He might not have to throw underneath so much if he stops leaning back like Fat Joe whenever he's throwing a forward pass.
Imagine losing to the dolphins
Not to sound like an old fuddy duddy but I will. Every game looks the same. Same field, same air conditioned stadium,  same shot gun formation, same plays, same runs, same passes. They used to play on shitty astro turf, grass, a baseball field, dirt, mud, snow. Barry would gain -2 yards and then 75 yards. I know the players are way better now but it used to be way more fun.
Dolphins look dangerous.  🐬
are there people on the bleachers?
Take a shot every time the announcer says "and it's a cut back!"
This game was boring why do these 2 teams exist?      I wish states that didn't have a team would make a new NFL team..
Who else was big brain enough to draft J-Rob for fantasy?!
Good win for the Miami
That statistic at the end though.... sad af
14:47 Beautiful hit
1:10 why tf are you clapping for
tampa bay receivers need to take some notes from miamis receivers. sticking like glue
um resultado normal de jogo.
I told them not to sleep on the Dolphins.
The MIAMI DOLPHINS are the greatest football team ever
Talk about our Pick-ems are all messed up😂
Do not care.
Dolphins' D looking impressive, especially man coverage, and reading the QB. No time or space given - no slack. You catch the ball, they're on to you already. Hope they can keep that up, qould be interesting to see them in play offs.
That offense without DJ Chark was hurting badly
When you have Gesiki on your lineup Bc you thought he’d put up numbers like last week.
Like.          Dislike   For good luck and SUCCESS 🙏🏻🌊
Jaguars need to fire their uniform designer.
The dolphins won their first game of the year. 😀👍🏈
Thank god I got Robinson in fantasy, man scored 30.9 points for me today!!!!
I took nap between this video... for the first time in my life I was so bored I’m tired
8:15 that poor poor running back
How does Florida have 3 football teams. They have an insane amount of sports teams. No joke, Florida has 50 sports teams
if u still think Minshew is good after this then ur trippin
Bruhh thank god I was able to finesse Robinson into my line up last second 😅
Minshew got 9 points for me today thanks
Damn everyone lost a lot of money tonight!!
Fins up
Cleveland, Cincinnati, Miami and, Jacksonville should just have to play each other for the rest of the season as punishment for being 🗑
Is minchew a dink and duck QB?
*Performs great in first two games*  Jaguars's Front Office: You know what,  we don't need to tank to get our franchise QB. We got one in Gardner .  *Goes up against the Fins*  Minshrew: Alright Imma head out.
Really the thing I am most concerned about is whether Minshew will turn out to be a Fitzpatrick type of QB who has really good games and really bad ones, also concerned if this offense can return to form, big game against the Bengals, now can the offense bounce back and over come another 14-0 lead (because let's be honest)
That hit on cole across the middle was beautiful
they celebrating winning against jacksonville
Minshew: I don’t want to tank Dolphins: Yes, you want to Minshew: No, I really d... Dolphins: YOU WANT TO
#42 on Jacksonville is agressive
Ya he is
Lol at 14:57 number 25 really thought he forced the player out 😂
Chark plays a BIG part in Jacksonville’s offense.
Wtf the db doing at 1:13? Clapping the catch?
Dolphins fan here what was up with Jags coaching tonight. The jags had terrible time management tonght.
I want to thank Minshew and Cole Sr for ruining my chances of winning in fantasy this week 🙃
Phins Up!!! Let's go!!!
Lets go dolphins
Is fitzpatrick underated???? Lmk???
1:16 man still thinks it’s college
Lamest primetime game of the century goes to................
7:01 Nice Fake blitz, thought 6 was coming but 2 backed up into zone lmao. Wish my Cowboys did this stuff
The main thing that I feel killed Jacksonville were the penalties. A lot of mistakes made by the team cost them many big moments throught the game. Regardless, I haven't been hyped about my Dolphins for quite a while. I'm excited to see what we can do this year #Phinsup
Super boring game ,but the the dolphins still don't compare to my Seahawks
they really should only use thompson if robinson needs a break like a nick chubb and kareem hunt situation. Robinson is very talented
Anyone see that block by fitzmagic 🔥🔥
They had the best game in a while except the patriots win lol
Dolphins: *obliterate Jacksonville easily*  NFL Media tomorrow: "Boy how about that Minshew, eh?  What a talent!"
13:48 did anyone else hear "wassup B*tch" "sup b*tch" 😂
About time they win somethin😂😂😂😂
The polls have been wrong two times in a row. people said the jaguars  were going to win and people said the saints were going to win
Bruh this is a college game
Man Jacksonville should’ve worn the all black
Like I say before there is no way that the Jacksonville win this  game the first week they get lucky to win the first game from my indianapolis colts.
That kicker
Nobody cares about you're fantasy team
1:11 what the heck was 33 thinking??
The more you think of it dolphins are pretty underrated tbh lost to the the bills by three points yet its a "blowout"
So glad that the Dolphins had a big lead and held it all game. First game in a while that they won without me being nervous at halftime.
What, who are this Dolphins!? It’s not so often you see them be this good!
Gaskin #1
I don't think I've seen that many checkdowns in a while. Who do you think you are? Alex Smith?
When Fitzpatrick turns into fitzmagic you better watch out 😂
The Battle for Floridas 2nd Best NFL team lol
I literally said to myself we should win This game we’re the better team we’ve lost to Great teams but not by much and next week we have the Seahawks which we’re probably gonna lose but still we’re better then people are saying
Is the jags defense really this bad or are the dolphins much better than I thought this year.
Worst game of the season and ravens vs chief best gane of thw season
Amazing dolphins keep this up
I’m still not satisfied with Miami’s defense
Glad to Minchew is in full effect. -_-
Miami dominated right from the start taking control the rest of the way and the Fins defense shut down Gardner Minshew for good. A first win of the season belongs to Ryan Fitz-Magic!
Thanks Robinson for the fantasy points😂 only reason I watched this game lol...
And here comes the death of my week 3 of fantasy football
Fitzmagic✊✊✊✊
Disappointing Lose But We Just Gotta Learn From It And Get Better So GG Miami We Gotta Be Prepared For Next Game
Ohh, they conveniently leave out the REDICULOUS PI call before the Phins 3rd TD that got them to the Redzone. That was one of the worst calls I can remember ever seeing. Breida hooked the Jags DBs arm who was running inside and BEHIND Breida and only looking at the incoming ball... He had his arm out to feel where breida was like near his waste, but had the inside position and Breida hooked his arm to make sure he didn't pick it and THEY CALLED DEFENSIVE PI...?   I seriously wanted to turn the game off at that point. That play changed the entire outcome of the game. It felt like I was watching fkn garbage ass WWE fake sports after that.  Jags didn't play good, but I can't stand when refs have such a huge influence on a game. It's disgusting and wreaks of shaving points for $.
Yep, I was just about to say the Beard beat the Stache
I feel like the jags should sign me for that line 😂  They did so bad
14:47 B o n k
Shenault to Seattle when??
Talk about exceeding expectations. Props to the dolphins and jags for putting up a fight.
damn miami was mean tonight.
Fitzpatrick throwing a block at 0:16
I told yall manshews wasnt beating my dolphins
C'MONNNNNNNN WHHHHYYYYY????!!! I LOST 16 POINTS ON THAT GAME!!!
Is Minshew Shane Falco
Yawn snor snug chu snug chu snug chu
The Dolphins dominated the Jaguars simple. The AFC East is actually gonna be a show to watch now!
cashews lost
It's like a game of whose defense is worse
1:10 my guy 😂
Thank you Robinson for the 30 fantasy points 💪💯💯
Dolphins show why they’re still Florida state favorite team. Lol
*Kratos took out Uncle Rico tonight*
FITZPATRICK
And y’all were trying to see the Jaguars were better than the browns lmaoo
Would’ve liked gaskin to get more yards.  Not a dolphins fan but he’s on my fantasy team while McCaffrey is out
FINS UP🐬🐬🐬🐬
Cowboys!!!! Go Dallas!
This mane still think he in college don't he? @1:11 Either that,or he was traded from the Falcons! Hahaha!
I love James Robinson for fantasy, and the jags head coach is a moron for not using him more
Ha can’t wait to laugh in my friends face for saying that the jags where gonna win lol lmaooo 😂
This jaguars team is too young, a lot of pressure for them to come out and perform in such a short week after a devastating loss... Minshew is still the real deal in my eyes some of those throws were spot on and the WR’s just didn’t perform
I farted lol
Thank you Dolphins for reminding Jacksonville who they really are.
This is a game that isn't worth getting COVID over.
Lets go Dolphins!! #FinsUp
Honestly Dolphins has a hell of an offense just need a better defense
This loss hurt man... Go Jags 😔
Jacksonville defensive is slow
Bad play calling tonight by Jay Gruden. He needs to let Minshew roll out on throw on the run some more. He just doesn't have the protection to sit in the pocket.
Bills win "But its only the dolphins" trust me this dolphins team is pretty good #BillsMafia
Florida vs. Florida? Nope   Minshew Mania vs. Fitzmagic? Nope  I think we can all agree that the real matchup was against Minshew's mustache and Fitzpatrick's monster beard.
boring ass football! meanwhile lakers all day everyday! one more win to advance to the nba finals!!!!
Robinson was the jags best receiver and rusher, should easily get 1200+ scrimmage yards
Fitz is out here looking like the GOAT against the Jags
How many people in stadium
Fitzmagic may happen every so often but the Jags were decimated on both sides of the ball.  Maybe the fact that the Fins played the Pats and Bills is what screwed them up.  Coming from a Pats fan Fins aren't as terrible as they looked the first two weeks.
Jags are back in the Trevor Lawrence sweepstakes
Nfl editors. Please show injuries so we can stay informed with the recap. Show the instant replays for great plays. Other than that you guys are doing great!
What happened to the Jaguars? They did good in the first two games but awfully lost this one.
8:13 was that Van Noy destroyed this RB? Man!
Gesiki is really coming into his own!
It’s weird hearing Chelsea Dagger during an NFL game.
#NFLdropEA
Miami is trending in such good direction.  I’m excited for the future I hope they get another high draft pick and tua shows up next season. Hold onto Brian Flores.
8:13 ouchhh!
Go Dolphins!!🐬
10:37 look at this guy!!! who does he think he is?? what a beast, keep an eye out for him
If people thought the jags would easily win it convincingly, i seriously don't know what to tell you! The Dolphins reminded the Jaguars who they REALLY are!!!
13:47 wassup b*tch
0:25 wheres the flag lol
TNF Home team always has the advantage. Jaguars look like they weren't ready to play. Smh
Fitzmagic is back in town
Don't tell a wizard his beard is weird and your mustache is better
After losing on sunday the Dolphins only had four days to get ready for this game and for them to bounce back with a performance like this one is just SPECIAL.
You see dolphins..lol
10:58 I hate when the ball be bouncing off the receivers hand just to get picked off .im not sure should that be on minshew or not
Are fans only allowed on Thursday nights ?
Now we can agree Bills are good.
I picked the Dolphins to win tonight!!! 😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌 😌
I don't know what came over me to start Minshew over Matt Ryan... 😭
Wow I thought the jags were going to blow dolphins out. But instead it was the dolphins blowing out the jags.
Thank you Jesus 🙏🏾✝️
If Fitzmagic plays like this all season, the Dolphins will definitely beat out the Jets for 3rd place in the division. 👌
I had James Robinson in my starting line-up, woo hoo to me! (He got 30.90 fan pts.)
WE WINNING THE SUPER BOWL
Jags are gonna have to do what the Dolphins are doing building through the draft. Losing Fournette, Ramsey and Campbell that is hard for any team to overcome.
Well robinson got me FAT fantasy points!
The Jaguars lost Chark and they become trash lol 🗑  #carried🤣
Man everyone was so hyped about Jacksonville not tanking and then they lose to the Dolphins. Robinson looks good though, he might save their season.  Props to Fitzpatrick for having the Dolphin record for highest completion percentage! Well deserved. Played like a champ
James Robinson is a underrated running back. He’s putting up solid numbers. Protect him at all cost!
James Robinson a beast he dropped 30 points for me in my fantasy football league
Um. I feel like this team is getting underestimated.  The Dolphins lost by only 3 points to the Bills, one of the better teams so far, and people called it a statistical blowout.
mInShEw MaNiA 🤪
James Robinson 🔥🔥🔥
Minshew is so trash. Idek why yall praise him like hes good lmao 😂
I swear Jacksonville's Defense Is so stank.. Straight up 💩💩💩   Wave It already!!! 🏳
Wow just wow
Yo I did not see this coming at all
This is why nobody beats Fitzmagic in preseason or training camp. When he's on, not only does he move the ball, but he looks good in the film room.
Imagine what Tua could’ve done to these jags
Had to watch highlights cause of the NBA Playoffs
Myles Jack so mad he the only good defender left from 2017 Jags
The beard treated the mustache like it was November!
Always amazes me how the "experts" always predict a Miami Dolphins loss.
Those jerseys the jags were wearing were LIT.
Now the Jags are tanking.
Dolphins going to the playoffs this year.
Well the good version Ryan Fitzpatrick showed up this game.
Minschew is just a hype job
I fell asleep after the opening drive honestly. No one wants to see these teams on prime time. What’s next? Washington vs Jets?
Robinson a beast
Putting the jags back in their place 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
COLOR RUSHH
We look promising. Finsup 305.
The Amish Cannon returns! He had a great block in the second clip as well!  Throwing himself out there, giving it all. Respect the beard.
Shoutout to james robinson for scoring 30 points on my fantasy team
I fell for the hype 🤦🏻‍♂️ “Trash Stash” Minshew garbage
Happy for fitzmagic, he deserved this W
The battle for Floridian supremacy has been won by Miami. Go Dolphins 🐬
The most compelling thing about this game was that there was more people in the stands tonight  in the midst of the Covid Era( limited attendance) than their has ever been in the past seasons back when times were regular lol 🤦🏿‍♂️
I don't know if it's just me but the Jags just seemed off today like they just handed the Dolphins the win or something. Definitely not the Jags team that entered week 1 and 2. (Edit: FitzMagic may be the cause of this radical change)
Kinda hyped that I last minute signed Robinson and put him in my lineup. Surprised he played this good today
Maimi killed the jags woo who
Is this considered a tank bowl??
Thanks a lot Minshew!!!! I started you in Fantasy and you give me this!!!!!
James Robinson killed it for my fantasy team! I told you guys to pick him up earlier this week.
#FinsUp
Finally a dub for them Fins! 🐬
Fins up
Okay but why can't Fitzpatrick play like that all the time instead of a couple games every season? Lol
fins up
Ugly Game Of Year
The Jaguars are starting to look like who we thought they'd be. If your letting Fitzmagic do this to you, you really must be in some trouble
Dolphins have most underrated TE's in NFL
Jags defensive coordinator doesn't send any pressure ... I believe every team has scored on us in the opening drive in all 3 games this year... That's a problem
Basically Northern Florida vs South Florida
Well tua wont happen for a little
Why is this in fast-forward
Todd Wash'd needs to go or learn that this isn't working.
Ryan Fitzpatrick is such a beast when he tucks that ball and runs.
I must say fitz put on a show, and miles gaskin is becoming a house hold name GG fins I'm proud, but we all know what needs to happen
It’s official: beard > mustache
FitzMagic showed up today. Good job Miami. Might be only one of a handful of wins that you'll get this season but at least it's a win.
Weird to see the the dolphins blow out a team.
I wouldve liked the win against the pats better ...
0:23 what was that about lmfao
WHERE IS TUA
FitzMagic vs Minshew Mania|Magic over Mania
Why the fins not using their 5 million per year back
Apparently magic is stronger than a mania
Robinson got me 30💪💪
Nobody watched this lmaaooo
Register to vote. Oh, and football. Seriously, register
Be honest, who actually watched this game 😂😂
The Beard will ALWAYS prevail over the Stache, no matter what happens....
Dolphins 5-11 and jags 3-13
There’s no reason for Jacksonville to lose this game. Really no reason for this
We got a Cat Fight Tank Bowl next week!
JACKSONVILLE JAGS LOSE TO ANAND'S DOLPHINS
I just searched this up cuz no free phone TNF, and it was just put up!! Let’s go
Ofc I decide to start minshew over burrow and Murray and this happens smh😭
FITZMAGIC STRIKES AGAIN!!!
Letsss goo finsss upp 🐬🐬
Never been this early 🌚
There it is
When the beard beats the mustache...
CJ Henderson is no Trevon Diggs
Early
I so happy for Conor Mcgregor and his team, they Finally got the first W of this season. Well done Dolphins 🐬 👏🏻👏🏻
Beep
the the both teams are bad lol
The Dolphins surprised these Jaguars with FitzMagic coming to the rescue!!
How early are we?!?!
Jesus Christ is coming soon to rapture his people repent and accept him as Lord and savior ✝️🙏🙌❤️
Fitz >
Damn who would’ve thought
As a Titans fan I'm pretty disappointed that the Jags Lost
Dolphins winning Super Bowl this year.
Mad early. Jaguars blow btw
Fitzmagic strikes again
Fitzmagic showed up tonight.
Did anybody even watch this game 😂😂
Cool refreshed and no views
