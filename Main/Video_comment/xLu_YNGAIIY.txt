Everone 2025😢 17:54
Ended two years ago and I cant seem to move on. I will forever be proud to have been here during this SMP, throughout the ups and downs. I dont think i'll ever let go, but maybe life isnt about moving on completely. Maybe you HAVE to hold on, remember, cherish. So if anyone out there is like me, still here, still proud, still sad, still holding on, just know, you are never truly alone.  Thank you. Thank you DSMP. See you in a bit.
this video was so funny and sad at the same time
13:20 dream used advanced interogation technique
Tommy: I’ve never cried on camera! What about when Techno died?
Why am I watching this is 2025 and crying all over again 😭😭😭
You guys ever felt like if the dream smp didn't end things could've been different?
Please don't use God's Holy name In vain please it's a sin. Atleast say oh my gosh.
Technoblade never dies :(
15:31 W MLG
I feel like its kind of my time to write bout this, so I've started watching dsmp right after tommy joined the server and trolls every single one of them and göt "what he deserved". I've been skipping this singular video and stream for 2 years because i wasnt ready to over it i rewatched it again and again and again and again. I've finally watched it, and even im free. Thank you all for the Best quarantine time that a Child could have had. I wish we can go back into those times
He lives in our hearts all ways if u r reding this I am sorry about tchno
It hits hard that back then you seen Tommy upload videos loads of time thinking I'm gunna have a good time watching them but now it's like an era in me when COVID happened those days will never happen again Tommy has moved on to something else not YouTube no more made days slower thanks for the good laughs Tommy see you in 5 years when I will see this video again and think about the book you made 😂
2:08 meanwhile...  11:28
Can’t believe its already been 2025 it hurts to watch
ik this came out years ago, but i was wondering if anyone knows what's the music used in here 15:34
I still cant believe it already ended 2 years ago. I miss dsmp so much dang it.  o7  rip dsmp i guess.     Well this is sad ive never got the chance to comment on any dsmp vids since i used my parents acc back then Technoblade never dies. o7 king  And well.. there were so many memories here dang  The unfinished symphony will forever remain unfinished ig.

That was emotional 😢
This makes me cry😭😭

Almost cried because of the thumbnail.
Guys..? I've been watching this every day since this dropped off. I'm seriously having a mental breakdown. Before Tommy jumped off the portal, he looked at us one last time. I'm crying and hyperventilating omg. I miss DREAM SMP so much! And Technoblade! 😭 I litteraly used to draw them in stick mans since i was a child, making unknown comics now i'm just here praying that they would join again and unite😭
rip tecno the king never dies :( i am trying not to cry rip the king technoblade we love you tech
Well..The only one that wasn't there for the group photo is techno.

2:11. "I never cried on camera". Techno. 🕊️👑
Its been 2 years 2 YEARS..
dream smp was my childhood watching the streamers grow and technoblade die then seeing them fight and laugh it was a ride and a thing they should teach us in history for years to come
At last only 1 man was not there at the end
Technoblade
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!!
Man i'm the last viewer..
the fact that tommy held his cry visiting techno's home
Still grateful for the memories of all of these. You guys were my childhood at prime:D

Good bye dream smp u will be deeply missed
Tommy I wish techno was next to you on that bench "We Miss You Techno"
he was so happy till he got into techno's house.
I'm watching this in 2025 and still remembering the fun times in the Dream SMP.  Its been 2 years now
damn...
I just started watching you and Technoblade alot, i just watched all 3 episoder of the great potato war and where you take ant frost hostage to mine cobblestone, I just wanna say that you’ve become my favourite YouTuber :)
I'm going to cry.. I watch you for many years and never seen this video
it's so sad that techno wasn't there to experience the last moments of the smp
RIP dream smp RIP technoblade RIP  (I never watch dream smp or technoblade I just felt sad and nervous)
This is kinda sad😕
The good old days.. still remember staying up all night just to watch tommy's stream and not to miss out any of the lore, can't believe that was 2 years ago already..
Oh dont even. Why am i here after 2 years.
R.I.P TECHNOBLADE
Very sad 😔 and heartbreaking 💔
10:43 ..."ill always have my friends"
14:52 sad that not everyone who once joined were there, just shows how much can happen in 4years.
Some how I cried
When I saw this, when I was a child I loved the dream smp and I can’t believe I’m still watching it and whe Tommy showed technoblade’s house I was crying man, and the dream smp is not over we can still watch it again and again and again, thank you Tommy for showing us the dream smp, I’m a huge fan and a huge supporter for the dreams smp.-forestales your biggest fan.
Anyone saw the sword with technoblade's cape on thumbnail?
good bye
Technoblade never dies. ❤❤
I’m crying right now watching this
Where your shows never ended And your loved ones never died  Where no person had ever been cruel And tears of sadness were never cried  Where time is standing still And the summers never passed  Where you have never hated And good times always last
im the first and last person in my bloodline to see this server rise and fall goodbye dream smp Good bye 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I came back to this video, I was happy, I clicked off, proper shaking and crying.
Tommy stop I can’t cry my friends are coming over
0:21  the second one 💀
Wait hes stopped posting? Since when
I never realized, coming back to this video.. it was truly heartbreaking. Never have I felt this way.. Thank you Tom for the memories.
Technoblade never dies
I cried 😔
The Way tommyinnit remembered his memories with techno is genuinely painful and heartbreaking to watch.
8:59  “I’ll talk to you…” *demon noises*
This is my  last time rewatching this video, i can finally say goodbye dsmp. i can finally move on and forget everything about it. I used to love this fandom, i even came back to it last year, what an awful mistake. After the allegations, everything got worse and worse, now ALL i can feel about this fandom is hatred and disgust towards the content creators, because of you guys the fandom became toxic, with the dramas between the members, with the false acussations, everything. Even though i dislike most of you now, i hope that you can live happy Tommy, and that you can move on from this too.
Dude seeing this vid in 2025 i insane love all you did tommy
I’m watching this video 2 years after it came out, the Dream smp helped me through a lot it gave me something to look forward to each day, my life started to get better and I was happier, but I’m back here again watching the Dream smp because my life has gone back to shit but that’s how life works and it’s a bitch. The Dream smp was a great thing that brought people together even though because of some people the Dream smp became hard to love, it’s still loved. Goodbye Dream smp, you helped many people through some hard times.
HOW THE FUCK DOES TIME GOES BY SO FAST WTFFFFFFF
Tommy was trying his best not to cry on stream
god i want a sadist animation of all of this
2 years late but this is actually the greatest thing to happen to humanity :)
Watching this in 2025 and having tears in my eyes is kinda sad. Especially technos pets sitting there. His house still there and stuff is making me all emotional I think yhe whole vid made me emotional. It's sad seeing my two favorite players leave the dream smp. For good.
i watched this in tears ;-;
cant believe his keyboard broke up with him
My crying when Tommy and tubbo   Listening to the last disc
Rip techno im my grandma had cancer and she deid
can you give the ip and start the smp for wievers?  please my dream is go to the dream smp
Tommy and Tubbo Dream and George not found Are the perfect dynamic dues
Whatching this 2 years later and the techno house tour still makes me wanna cry
Technoblade was properly going to destroy your base after you build it again  Rip technoblade
Why did it end
Goodbye dream smp
I shed tears when he went to Technoblade’s house😢
Why did u leave the smp
10:59 this part.... 11:44 ... 12:10

It's been an honorable history 😢😢😢😢
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Ok who else is in 2025 and still crying to this day 😢
A great finale to the Dsmp especially the part where he looks into the camera in the end, And also R.I.P technoblade never dies

ending made cry fr
17:54 “why did I decide to watch this now, at 05.48 in the morning?” Idk but did Tommy kiss the brick before throwing it? Yes and I’ve never been this happy for a finale even though I’m still sad, BYE DREAM SMP, I will miss you and yeah kinda late but that doesn’t matter
XD
11:56 dont cry man pls😢😢
Idk why i am crying
kinda the last good tommyinnit vid
I was here😂😂😂😂
Two whole years, the story has ended. All of those memories of the Dream SMP, will stay. Thank you all for doing and putting up with this for two whole years. The fact that Tommy went to Technoblades' house for a final time made me just burst out in tears. Thank you
At the end, I think we could all tell Tommy was trying not to cry by laughing and hiding his face
Coming back here, I wish technodad was allowed to come in to the server in these final moments, just to see the impact his son made on the server.
WHY AM I CRYING
I love the daimond sword and cape with the crown next to tommy on the bench in the thumbnail
2:09 that's a lie løl. I've seen you cry on camera løl.😅
12:25 MADE ME CRY SO HARD😢
It hits different watching it again 2 years later o7

спустя 2 года, я смотрю это снова......... удар по сердцу. Я люблю эру ДримСМП, она действительно повлияла на меня. Спасибо Дриму за создание этого сервера, за то что привел многих дюжей туда, спасибо Томми за его хаос, спасибо всем контент мейкерам за стримы. ДримСМП - это труд всех стримеров.  Техноблейд никогда не умирает! о7

Aw man growth hits different
Nooo technoblade dies :( NOT EVEN CLOSE BABY TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
0:21 BRO THE SECOND ONE 💀
o7
Tommy innit is just unrespectful to the dead technoblade died but he still stole his items that is unrespectful to the dead and just imagine techblades soul came out from the wall and said are you stealing from me again
This aged well
2025 hits hard when you know you watched this video years ago
why cant bro just make his own smp and still post
14:38 how’d Hannah get an elytra? If people,weren’t aloud at the end?
can you be my mincraf friend
i have a question for you

Technoblade will be remembered ❤
2025 --------->

Thank you for the laughter and happiness you guys gave
❤
I sobbed
Bye teno and he’s build and everything bye Dream smp😢

That's so sad 😿
Coming back to this agian and agian never fails to hit me with gut rendering nostalgia and memories of feeling the best and happiness ever
WHTY U LEAVING
I cant believe its been 2 years…
Nah im in 2025
knock knock its 2025 and im getting emotional watching this
Dream SMP never die's 🥺
0:21 Tommy WHY DO YOU HAVE “Read how to sex “
Sad to see techno wasnt in this day. It was his sweet voice and humor and chaos that he caused all whilst being a legend. He honestly changed my whole childhood and this server was a big part of my life in covid. Fly high techno and goodbye Dream SMP🕊
I tore down in tears on techno's cabin alone. The DSMP comforted me through the covid pandemic, sas to see ut go away😭😭😭
Goodbye dsmp, we will surely miss you life long
i hope techno is flying high in heaven as he should, Long Live the Legend ❤🕊️
Im aclualy crying right now bro😭😭😭
I WANTT IT BACKK ITS ALREADY 2025!!!!!!!!
Going back and revisiting some of the fandoms I used to be in, and now that I think about it the dream smp did so much for such a large group of people and it impacted so many lives in so many ways. I found Tommyinit and the Dsmp when I was in some of the lowest times of my life and in a way, it kept me alive. I don't know how I haven't seen this video till now but I'm happy I saw it.
Bye.
I am rewatching it in 2025 but I  am regretting watching it 😢😢 bad thing is techno isn't here saying bye to smp 😢😢 ahhh
you cried for technoblade... 2:07
Although techno is gone, There. Is. A. 2nd. Version. Of. Techno, T.B had a friend that was reading his things and his voice got so out of a tuning thing idk, his voice sounds like techno, i met him on VRChat so i’ll tell the username later
e
Goodbye dream smp you'll never be forgotten
Carl, Steve, Apollo, Em.  They will all wait for Technoblade and remember him. And no one, i mean NO ONE. Will forget him and what he brought to that server, TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES.
Why did it end?
I’m still crying about this
My eyes are so sore and I feel like I'm going to vomit bc of how much I'm cry
Rest In Peace Technoblade.
And here the story ends 17:50
Disrespectful that dream wore the crown when the blade died😞
16:15 that one main characters look at soon as the movie ends
i remember watching this 2 years ago and bawling my eyes out because i loved dsmp sm lmao
Fucking finally!
...2025. Getting recommended this right now has just full on been crushing ngl... Why do I miss it??
Someone 2025?
Tommy jumping out off the end made me cry 😢😢
5:52  that so funny like what the heck 😂😂😂😅
That visit to Technoblades House is devastating. I wish he could've been here for the ending. I can already see him shooting down the dragon with his multishot firework crossbow and cackling at everyone as he did his own thing Rest in peace 🙏
that bucket list was crazy
Why did he quit though? Did it just not feel the same anymore?
I hope theres gonna be more to be honest, loved the series i mean who didnt? rip techno w to you all
Yeah you never cried on camera before Technoblade 2:09
Happy birthday to this beautiful video
I think my game log, lagged.
came back here in 2025. Still cried once I’d seen techno’s cabin, I’ve been watching his old videos and streams for a few days now. Hurts he’s gone, it’s been so long since I’ve been back to watch and dsmp things.
Thanks for making my childhood life awesome tommy!
what mic do u use?
2:13 he cried in a video when technoblade died, R.I.P Techno, you will be missed ❤
He never dies. Remember that…
That last head up was unironicly legendary
Wow 2 years TODAY it ended but the strange thing is I’ve kinda just gotten in to the fandom so that’s cool like I started watching it 4 days ago but honestly it’s amazing so far and to know that it has ended 2 years ago is making me a bit sad but I’ve still got a lot more to watch so yay :)
10:27 goodbye dream smp.
I brought his merch
6:28 I came back for this after 1 year 🤣
17:31 😢
Most of my Covid days went into watching the dream SMP
I lowkey miss these times
Y they quit
... i know im visiting this a year later but... this low key made me cry, thissmap changed my life during covid, techno never dies
Im in tears
Dream took Technoblade's crown 😭 Wholesome
ehe
When you think about it, techno never saw the end in the SMP he never beat the dragon and he will never get the achievment... Dont cry because its over, smile because it happened. Dont forget to eat your potatoes kids... Hexa out
Tommy sounded like he's gonna cry when he enter technoblade's house.
This was really wholesome. Seeing all of the memories made here and all of the fun you guys had here, techno would be so proud.
technoblade cabin brought me on my knee's crying i was never a watcher of this channel or dream smp but i came here because of techno
oh that was sick
This really was a dream SMP.
that last and GREATEST MLG felt quite.. BIZZARE
"I really like how you were so confident to face reveal" HELP😭 Shii it I cried at the end
Tommy saying he never cries on camera  Also tommy:reacts to Technos death  R.I.P Technoblade ❤❤❤
1 year already 😞
Just wanted to say this real quick. In the thumbnail of the video, on the left side of the bench, you can see Technoblade's cape and a diamond sword. Technoblade Never Dies
after the resent events this video is so much more funny
technoblade never dies and goodbye dream smp
You are making  the ending so beautiful
12:15  TECNOBLADE NEVER DIES ❤❤❤❤❤ SONG LIVE THE KING
Will you re join?.....right? Next time right?.............please re join it when you join them and do stuff it always makes me laugh my ass off.........
I felt my heart dropped when i saw this video, Dream SMP was one of the biggest hyperfixation that's in my life when it was the time of COVID.(2020-2021), it's so sad to see all of the Dream SMP members leave one by one and going to different paths like its Graduation day, i cried during this video since Dream SMP was the one that carried my entire childhood and i didn't wanna let go of it ti'll today.  Well, Goodbye Dream SMP, even though im 2 years late at this video, im glad i spent all of my childhood watching you guys, Thank you.
ngl I started cry the minute he entered tocno's house
12:18 u can see him hide his emotions. It’s ok Tommy he is always in our hearts ♥️
2:45 i love that it he forgot to delete the "bottom text" xD
Who will miss the dream smp?
I’m crying rn.

Why does dream have Technoblades crown
A year later and this is still an awesome vid always loved the dream smp! one of my first creators I watched all the time
This has been a bigger part of our lives than Tommy's... and it's just too hard to hide the tears.

Techno's house bringing tears

Salute for the server 😢
Bye dream smp
2025 anyone?
2025?
As soon as the path to techno's cabin was shown, I was already tearing up like wth thatw as sooo emotional. The fact that Wilbur and Techno was absent during the last screenie with the dsmp members was sad...
"Technoblade never dies!" o7
covid + dsmp was a goated combo
Watching this after so long. Goodbye, TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES! NOT EVEN CLOSE BABY!
R.I.P TECHNOBLADE ❤❤❤
I'm gonna miss the dream smp
goodbye dream smp
Dsmp: The last dance
It's so sad that techno couldn't live to see this😢

why did i start tearing up they were my childhood and my happyness all through covid goodbye dream smp
RIP Dream SMP
0:00 to 5:00 Am I still here wondering that all the topics Tommy said about Dream, he never once showed proof of that happening? Like if your gonna explain something, at least have evidence.
First here in 2025 and this server was one of the biggest thing that got me into gaming and now that people are leaving  it breaks my heart
2025 someone?  Edit:😮If im being honest i never got so much likes so thank u so much for 46 likes they really mean somethin for me❤
ok I'm crying 😢
Technoblade rest in power
10:43 ill always have my friends 😢
i cant believe he didnt cry during the titanic 11:02 were real men cried
nah he shouldve said "it was never ment to be" when he blew up the hotel
Read how to sex😭🙏
this is so sad....
2025 anyone? This made me sad:(
Dream smp was a big part of my life and I would always look forward when a new stream or video would come out because these streamers would bring so much joy into my life. Especially tommyinnnit.
Why'd you leave..
I will miss dream smp😢
o7 he never forgot his landlord technoblade
They should've places the dragon egg at techno's base to honor him one final time with a sign under saying "techno never dies...."
2025? Best smp server.
07
still miss the dsmp
Its been a year since Dream Smp Has ended
sad to see that technoblade wont be here
My crying, cause he is not posting, me realizing I have adhd which makes me happy My mind:guys were doomed My friends:RUN FOR SAFETY! me:does of saddness
This literally just reached 4 million views how does the new "Dream" video, from Tommy.. HAVE MORE VIEWS THAN THE END OF AN ENTIRE ERA?! HEH!?!?!?!?!?!!??!!!!!???
sad to see them fight now
I’m here from 2025 and this shit still brings me tears😢❤
1:25 not anymore buckaroo
9:47 you use a comma instead of a period when addressing someone in a letter like this
DAM scripted
But why dis you have to leave 😢😢😢
Bye
mannn
Is anyone in 2025 👇
I think it says a lot that the moment Tommy’s chains were broken, a year after he finally leaves the server. He proceeds to completely lambast and loath Dream himself. He *desperately* wanted to leave. That all being said I’m glad he was able to give a good proper sendoff in a positive manner.   Even if that means completely throwing Dream under the bus, albeit deservingly
I just couldn't hold back my tears when u went to the blades/techno his base
Just realised after a year that the setting sun in the thumbnail is actually the atomic bomb from the finale
I’m crying. Crying in 2025 because of this video and all the memories. IN THE BIG 25.
this video is insane going back
This shows even a game like mine craft can show some of the deepest memorys
seeing him go to technos house made me tear up. i love tommy, i loved techno and i loved that server.
ouch? i watched this and nearly cried omg, i wasnt a big watcher of dsmp but gosh this hurt to watch... knowing the pain that everyone has gone through just hurts in a different way
itsm in dreams, SMP
the visit to technos cabin made me cry..
8:05 you know tommy I never spun being so gay😂
we need like a dream smp reunion i think it would be a good idea
Damn this video really hit hard
Its the end of an era.
he shouldve gave dream the discs and do a 1 last 2v1 dream vs tommy and tubbo
14:46 JUST KILLED A GOGY, FEELIN’ GOOD
Its been 1 year
never thought it would end ,i used to watch alot
thank you for the wonderful experience watching the dream smp lore. im sad that its over but it was a fun while it lasted. i was there watching it from the first episode to the last. this actually made me tear up a bit lol. i miss techno but hes in a better place now. im gonna miss this server so much but thank you for some of the best 2 years of my life, you will always be the good guy of that story tommy. goodbye Dream SMP.  -yanelle<3
No... This series was awesome i hope dream creates another smp the memories its too much i want you to continue this series in case dream does create another smp until next time of dream creates another smp i bid fair well.
Techno is the main character of the Dream SMP not Tommyinnit
Why did Tommyinnit even disconnected?
Hopefully one day, you’ll make your own SMP i loved watching your vids:)
Its been a year since we said good bye to Dream smp... what a childhood
Technoblade should be proud...
You may rest in peace techno, and i hope tommy has a wonderful and amazing life...
rip for the dream smp
It was a nice time while it lasted, I'm happy we got to experience this server and all the people we met. Letting go is hard, but it is part of life. Now that it is over, a new chapter of our live has begun. I wish every single one of you the best from the bottom of my heart, watching this video made me relieve some of my best and worst moments in life. Thank you Tommy, thank you all for this wonderful time we were blessed with, I'm happy it wasn't a sad ending (well it kinda was) but we got to to and see the things we wanted to, and that is important. Take care
And then you realise that there will be no DreamSMP ever and never. The End
2:45 bottom text
Pls bring back dream SMP
When he went to techno’s house I could hear the sadness in his voice
Rip techno
The old Tubbo is better
If only Alex had lived to see that final fight. Godspeed, you magnificent bastard. o7
this sounds so, so strange. but dream sounds. so republican???? there's something about both his microphone and his actual voice that just sounds red
Nah dream is the main character

its arready been one year😢
2:08 lie u cried
It's heart breaking when you realize that in technoblade's house his bed is replaced with the double chest 😢
I started crying when you started walking down the prime path.
goodbye Dream SMP
Time flies...
I could hear the click of his keyboard ending the video at the end XD
2:44 The bottom text 😂
Dream only wants peace for the dream SMP
This made me shed tears because I have been watching the dream smp when it almost just started it honestly broke my entire child hood it also hits me so hard that techno is gone but I have accepted it❤
boohoo cry more
What good times must come to the end.
quick question, who is o7?
okay this comment may be weird but does anyone realise that at the time tommy is reading how to sex his fly is undone
Wait guys is it just me or when Dream joined the server, it doesnt sound like him. Is it just me?
It would have been very funny if techno had the discs and no one knew
At the end the vid thats says u should wach was " I joined dreams smp server "
Why did they stop is it because of Technoblade?
4 things were missing.....
i know that im just commenting now but where tommy goes to technos house i can feel his sadness little by little i can see it in his face that he wanna cry so bad but doesnt its prob because he said that to tobbo but idk i can just feel it and see it on tommys face
love your vids
is been a year without the dream smp..
The visit to technos house got me crying
HOW HAVE I NEVER SEEN THIS VIDEO BEFORE
It’s so sad at the end because they were going to leave the dream SMP
I wonder how past tommy would react if he found out that present tommy went back in the server for a bit
I cried. Everyone fighting the end dragon, and Tubbo and Tommy watching the sunset and listening to the discs one last time is just..an amazing ending. Tysm.
This actually made me cry
He should show us all the screenies he took on the dsmp
11:05 - 12:25 was the saddest part, visiting techno's cabin. Could hear the pain in Tommy's voice when he said, "what can I steal?" Techno was probably the funniest guy I've ever seen. He had such character and personality, brought so much life and humor to to the dsmp. He's not dead though, he's still in our heart's. Like he said, "TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES", I hope he's in a better place now. Rest in peace Technoblade. ❤️
Why the hell did you do that
from the famous words of sabrina carpenter, “don’t smile because it happened baby, cry because it’s over.”
I never watched Techno, heck, I didn’t even know him. Yet it still hits me like a train that he’s no longer with us and died so young. I cry at every mention of him. I didn’t realise how much his death would take a toll on the community, its genuinely heartbreaking.
A year ago
it got retconned :333 ctommy is good now
why bro why tomminnit why
14:39 the chat 💀☠️
is it bad that i cried five times
8:09 bruh 💀
6:30 eret appearing in the reaction was hilarious
14:52 should've edited a ghost version of technoblade in that picture.    o7
The best memorial video i have ever seen , and Techno just made it even better
4:02 got me ded😂😂
Its been a years since it ended and i am still hoping for a tommy smp! Haha ha.... Ha.... I miss techno......
8:51 dream wearing techno shrine😊
its late but, ty for everything.
14:52 Without technoblade💔
It actually made me cry 😔My childhood memories were here 🥹🥹🥹
If you like this you are “GAY”
Dream:Villain Technoblade:Hero Ranboo:Main Character Tommy:Side character that says all the funny lines 🗿👍
Corkery Ridge

this video jenuinly ik i spelled it wrong but im 10 yrs old give me a break i want to cry watching this video
0:21 HELP THE SECOND 😭😭
It’s so emotional actually seeing your fav streamers quit after techno’s death. It’s really sad I even cried last year when I saw it. After those years of just go watch the streamings. Mcc champion ships when some teams had won and everyone was happy. I just miss those old days I wish they could come back this or next year for last time if it has to be it..
even this shit makes a grown man cry.
Like remember when episode 13 tubbo and Tommyinnit just listens to a disc and now they reamade it
I feel like...  I'm Gonna miss dream SMP like it was fucking likea movie to be continued then to be continued and to be continued like 2 years watching... Dream SMP i feel like I'm gonna cry shit bye dream SMP
Sing the song one more time the cat laid song
This hit hard at 2
Dsmp literally changed my life i was like 9 when i first watched dsmp in like 2020 and lowkey like dsmp prettymuch raised me bro like i was crying for more thaan half of this video
I’m gonna cry
aku dari bakwansmp
I’m not crying, you are Rest in Peace Technoblade. Thank you Tommy and EVERYONE on the Dream Smp for the rollercoaster of emotions that you’ve given us …and goodbye Dream Smp    👋😭❤
I didn't support the members of the dream SMP i never watched them but i heard about them how much joy and laughter they bought thousand of people. Even after a year of the SMP being finished i watched this video for the first time and it brought me to tears they way all of the members get along have fun is amazing and wholesome. Tommy doing things he hasn't yet done, him visiting techno's house for the last time, killing the dragon, laughing with tubo, the kind and gentle smile at the end. So for all the years i missed TECHNOBLADE NEVERS DIE'S and goodbye dream smp 😭🫡🐷👑✌🏼
2:07 you might want to take that back Tommy
thank you for everything tommy.🥲
Welp we miss you guys you guys make us happy hope you guys come back we miss you guys
i wish tecno was there to kill the ender dragon :(
The Most Beautiful Ending to the Most Beautiful Journey.
When Tommy took the SS in techno's house ... I could see Him.
I remember myself always watching the DreamSMP in the covid times, it was lowkey peak in those times.
I know that revisiting technos old cabin hits hard, but can we talk about Tommy's bucket list..
2:44 bottom text
i really need TO SEE YALL HAVE another SMP I MISS IT SO MUCH
Been a year huh?
Is it just me or in the thumbnail that Tommyinnit has a tear?
don’t have to stop playing on the server
tommy yes you did cry on camera when .... tecno... passed😢
I’m just imagining Technoblade being there. Ending the SMP. o7
Noooooo I'm going to have panic attack 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I started crying, omg..
theres one person missing...
1:36 lol
This is me in 2024, and this came out. This will never be forgotten😢❤
finally
You know what would be cool if they made the dreamsmp into a public sever just saying:)
Sex!?!?!?????
ammm ....actually tommy and mrtechnodad kinde returned to to the smp on one of tommy streams
Oh, so all the 3 years of Dream SMP no one ever got to the end??? Or is it meant to be this super epic finale moment???
Im gonna miss them😢 i miss the old them😢
im actually bawling from him visiting technos cabin, he'll forever will be missed, RIP.💔
No one gonna talk about the 3 withers
I'm gonna cry again
I was never even around for the dream smp streams but this hits as hard as a peice of bedrock flying in your face  The dream smp will and always be remembered as the best and most iconic smp 🫡
Imissyou guys!!!
The one thing Technoblade wanted on the Dream Smp was completed finally.
1 year later and this still hits hard....😥😥
well, good bye.
it still hits me hard
❤
I actually cried😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I kept telling myself not to cry but I am crying
Me too..
Me..
Not last:)
HI !!😇😈
I remember watching that stream. DSMP was one of my biggest parts in my life and it was so hard to let it go. But like tubbo said, all good things must come to an end. Thank you for everything.
o7
nah bro quoted himself at the end tf
Tommy, you need to stop, you tried to ban dream to make it the “Tommy SMP” even though this is dream’s world, just think about it for one second, dream could have broken out of prison all this time, he’s the creator, he’s the operator, he had creative mode, he wanted peace ☮️ and then you came and destroyed/ obliterated that….
I loved the dsmp, it’s been more than one year and I still check up on all the ppl. Tommy used to be my fav, techno came a close 2nd. It really hits when u realize it’s not coming back. This was my comfort, my half home. I miss all of it. The streams sometimes make me cry lol.
Bro really met tubbo when Fortnite released💀
Who saw this on 2024
Im freaking crying rn😢
i feel it to having to loss a peace of your memory and looking back at it and loving every moment of it even "the bad ones"
Plz don't quit like tecnoblade and George and dream😢😢😢
Nahh man im actually cryin- No joke man wth.. I will miss the dsmp. I think we all will
I think i remember stopping watching the dsmp when dream was in prison part i never realised ill be left out for over 1 year by so much and since alot happened since i thought maybe ill revisit my comfort zone when it was covid time but sadly it already ended and its gonna take me hours trying to catch up so i just watched this vid and maybe ill accept it and then i guess thats rlly it I regret not continuing to watch them but this has been a fun or sad one to watch xd. so heres my last message for tommy and everyone in dsmp THANK YALL FOR BEING MY COMFORT IN COVID LAST YEAR IT WAS SO FUN AND THE BEST, EVEN THO IM SO LATE SORRY LETS ALL LET GO NOW GUYS BYE LOVE YALL!🫶🏻
This was released 10 days after my birthday :D
Make another SMP???🙏
he only got here because of plot armour. He is the 'main character' after all
I’m so sad because I love his videos on the dsmp and I wish he would continue
Its been a year and I still watch this with tears
i miss being happy
This so fucking sad :(
I'm not crying, you are, goodby dreamsmp
11:12 I miss Techno…..
I wish techno was there with everybody😢
I finally collected the courage to watch this after a little bit longer than a year and damn... I'm so glad for the memories and I don't think I'll ever forget. thank you.
I miss DSMP😢❤
why did they even end the smp?
Goodbye dsmp we are gonna miss you all…❤
This went to far
3:07 Shroud
This is what made me happy when my life was terrible. I still remember waking up early morning to watch every single member of the Dream SMP live stream about it. Thank you all for everything.
The Dream SMP was a wild, heartbreaking, fun and cool experience. I'm sad to see that there will be no more Dream SMP but, I'm happy it happened.   Fly high Techno, and goodbye Dream SMP. It was nice watching yall. I wish they would at least have a renuion..
I’m so sad that it ended I still can’t believe all the things that have been going down lately it’s so sad to see this video now in 2024, the dsmp was a comfort n safe space for me during covid and all of that I’m so sad to actually really see that it’s all over now and a lot of things are falling apart.
Who's here in 2024👇
This is sad, ❤ 😢
Can you do a reunion
Even though this video came out a year ago, I had refused to watch it because I lost interest in the dsmp after techno passed. Now that I have watched it a year later. I can truly say that this server changed everyone for the good. It was truly a gift.
This is such a bittersweet moment... Had to be hit with the reality check that this was a year ago.
Im SOBBING RNN       This was my teenhod durring covid im still after a year uppset that it ended all the memories all the laughs all the wars... but all god things must come. to a end....   Thank you to every one. Goodbye Dsmp.
Even though im not a fan, its so sad that everyone is leaving the game after those years, and i even regret not watching all their old videos. Its so funny seeing all their good moments together, even if its the last ones. Right now, im watching all of the old videos on all their channels, and i feel sad that i missed all of these moments back then.  Please dont tell me im depressed or acting rn im not joking
Goodbye Dream SSP
the disc sunset and Technoblade part made me cry
This was peak entertainment under Covid, and 1 year on this video is still very emotional😢
I love the old good days teacnobled  and dream rest in peace teacnobled house
I’ll never get these years back :/ rip techno I still can’t believe you’re dead.. miss you all around awesomeness but I’m glad my time watching you is cemented into the internet forever.
The way Timmy went from chaotic to peaceful when he was in technos cabin. Fly high techno. We all miss you.
Hey i know im so late but i totally just noticed you used the same Celeste song for the ender dragon fight as jschlatts smp live ender dragon fight and I salute you for that
Goodbye
All the good times😢
Techno, I wish you still were alive, his home and pets, just waiting for him to come once more, the players leaving and playing for the last time. Thanks for all those memories. The Dream SMP
i want this back
2:44 bottom text
How do they have elytra’s before opening the portal
I can't believe how long it's been since techno died and the amount of happiness and joy everyone had while killing the ender dragon was so great to see R.I.P technoblade
Nooooooooo
Still can't believe it's been a year...
thank you for everything, goodbye.. dream smp
This server got so toxic if anyone stayed in it longer they would’ve gotten rads.
"read how to sex"☠️
14:52 you're missing a pig...
I finished watching the whole thing and the recommended video to watch next is tommy joining the dream SMP for the first time... How ironic...
cant believe they havent been to the end that whole time
This hurt so much to watch. I’m tearing up right now.Goodbye Techno, Tommy, Dream.😭😭😭
Tommy gets OP for 30 seconds and somehow manages to ban the entire server 😂
0:29 That Voice Crack Tho 😂
I thought dream was the main character of the dream smp 🙃
As soon as it ended I broke down in tears...
❤ bye 😢
"Tom Tommy like explosion" LMFAO
The end of an era, and hopefully a beginning of a new era
i just watched this video again, and honestly even though i never played on the smp it was such a huge era in our lives and i think kept many of us sane through covid. thank you for always making us laugh, and even though this video made me cry, im so thankful you made it. o7 tommy (if you ever see this)
I don't know how I would've survived the pandemic without dream smp honestly
6:16 Chaos began, Sam what have you done, I literally couldn't breathe I was laughing so hard
Fun fact at 11:54, he actually looks back at that picture
In time stamp 10min i was so sad like really😢
The Read how to sex is crazy ☠️☠️
9:00 💀
12:56
DSMP Fact: i animated a goodbye tommyinnit animation and it looks so decent and clean. Edit: love ya man, have a great life hope your subs keep growing.
Why did this got recommended to me again
wwhy do they stop?
I felt sad watching vid(the last vid) of dream smp and i teared while watching.... Even my dad asked me why were u crying? I was "no dad i am not" he said it looks like u are crying so i told him the truth he left me alone so that i would get some peace and i remembered see the videos of all the (disc wars,and even when tommy hid in technos house without telling him it was hilarious) i was so sad untill now i have been seeing all the videos throughout my entire smp carrer and many months i have been.. noticing ( FAMILY FRIENDLY GUY BBH) MISS HIM TOO LOVE AND ) AND A WISE MAN SAID:TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES LOVE TOO ALL DREAM SMP MEMBERS AND EVEN DREAM FACE REVEAL AND I HOPE THAT EVERYONE STAYS STRONGER YOUNG AND GROW BIG TOO.            LOVE ALL MEMBERS BEEN THROUGH AND PHIL I HOPE U GET STRONGER AND NOT GET OLD    AND THIS ONE IS FOR U BBH FUUUUUUUUCCCCK  SOORY
it was nice
This is just a note for myself because I have to put it into words.  I admit that I never watched the final videos of the Dsmp. When I stopped watching dsmp streams and its streamers the server was already pretty much inactive with the members doing various other projects. It already felt like the end of an era. At some point Tubbo and Ranboo fell apart and then Techno died and although I knew Tommy, Tubbo, Dream and the others had done their final dsmp streams I could never bring myself to watch them. Now, two years later I am here, sobbing and actually missing a time of my life that happened during Covid of all things, even though it was basically the dark ages for many people. Another reason why have not touched a single dsmp related video or vod was because I felt bad for still loving the dsmp so much. I know the members have mostly drifted apart and rarely interact (which is completely normal and happens constantly in life). I have no idea what the Dream Team is doing. But the reason I felt so bad about it is because I noticed most of the CCs don’t want to be associated with the dsmp anymore, and some of them have turned out to be terrible people. But it should be fine, right? To come here and seek comfort and remember the times where Tommy and co made me laugh so hard and forget the stress of daily life. Just now I watched that stupid clip of Quackity trying to be Dreams therapist, and before that the one where Dream, Tommy and Tubbo made Twitch Prime a religion. And although the memory is a bit tainted now, I couldn’t help but laugh again.
Rewatching this in 2024😢
imagine if tommy visited the syndicate that techno and phil did to the stronghold
true
WAIT THE QUIT I YEAR AGO ALSO RIP TECHNO BLADE
My tween years summed up
Bro i wish techno was there
ik this was a year ago but it still hits just as hard now :[
Im not saying i cried but I'm also not saying i didn't cry
More than 1 year ago... 😔
This hits hard but it is what it is.
It's 2024 and I still cry over this  video
You and all the SMP members inspired me to never give up. Its sad to see it go. Thank you for going through it all. I wanna cry :)
Thankyou so much for all the memories 💗
i miss y'all so much 💗
Has Dreams voice gotten deeper since the 2021?
Claim your "been watching since the first time tommy joined dsmp" veterancy here 👇
"And like respawn Henry and stuff" bro made me cry while lying to Dream to get OP
im back 1 year later.. wow.
I fucking cried so hard
"I really like how confident you were to *face reveal*." 8:47
Tommy's last canon death being lost because he accidentally killed Tubbo's bee is so fitting
I rlly miss the back days when techno was here😢
Dsmp is part of my child hood now im turning 15 and this is just a wow before i go to collage, now time to visit techno...
Goodbye covid and bye to 2 years of dream smp..
Dsmp was my childhood, the whole world will have entered a new era.
R.I.P technoblade🫡
create the tommysmp
See techno’s house made me cry even though it has been a while
11:53  you can see even in his eyes that he misses techno rip
love u mha
Instinctively started chanting "one of us" when tommy rang the donation bell of Techno.  "Technoblade never dies" a quote that will forever hold its own weight as the truest statement of the century.  o7
LEAK THE SERVER
I need to get ready for the day
Technos probably gunna haunt you for taking tha disc lol
only if techno was there
I was cry through the whole video we all the the DSMP❤❤❤❤❤❤
Technoblade may be dead… but his spirit will live on
Why DreamSMP is so classic? Every top tier of MC streamer on it!
Goodbye dream smp…
Rest in peace o7🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️🕊️

man idk how i’m just seeing this now but the dsmp got me through most of covid it was so comforting just watching the streams and laughing so much i’m grateful to have experienced it till the end❤️
rewatching this for the 4th time this time it hits hard. i payed close attention to all the old memories and stuff. it’s like my bestest of friends saying they’ll commit. o7 for techno and the memories of this server. it’s been a pleasure to be here viewing all of the glory the server had. this is the first time i cried insanely hard. this series was a huge part of my life it was actually half of my whole fucking life and i saw it all, for the last time. i’m surprised i commented a year later and not when it came out but finally it’s came. thanks to everyone on this smp for being. a huge impact on my life. i’ll always cherish this in my heart. i wish everyone grew old playing on this smp peacefully. but everyone knows not everything lasts forever. i’ve cried so many times rewatching the past videos and streams on this server. i’m planning to try and recreate it on my server but i don’t have enough courage. i’ll work up to it soon but anyway. goodbye. i hope to see season 2 if it ever comes in the future. 🫡
Thank you for the memories❤️🙏💯
been a year and it still hurts. i miss this. i grew up with the dsmp and you guys raised me when my parents didn’t want to
This guy is so annoying
Shall techno remain in the dream smp
“Well…I guess this is goodbye” ahh video 💀💀🤓
N
Any one else who was 👌 that close from crying
"LoNg TiMe No PoNk" got me rolling on the floor XDDDD
Techno never dies.
You and Tubbo are an amazing couple.
8:47 we still have dreams face.
This was only 500% funny without Technoblade D:
Goodbye to the dream smp,
: ((
I´ve past a lot of wonderfull moments seeng videos of these smp, that damn I cant realise that it had finish. ;)
The way this video is so old and I've watched it over 15 times and it never fails to make me cry.
Good bye dream smp you got me though all the fights of my parents and brought a special place in my heart goodbye and thanks for a couple few years of my life :)  (My parents are divorced now :p)
Ahhh man it really hurts 😢 me😢😢😢Iike I'm crying now very sad ending 😢.
those discs were so much more than discs.
hit me right in the feels
End of a journey
The way he looked in the camera before jumping in was so sad for some reason 😭
Can i have the ip of dream smp😅
The fact that he let tubbo have the last word killed me.
Bro it hit me so hard when he went to technoblades house… WHY DID HE STEAL
celeste?
Definitely what he would have wanted what a wonderful friend
14:48 ‘just killed a gogy feeling good😭’
Goodbye
POV: Your the ender dragon who’s been chilling for 3-4 years then you see 10 people enter your domain at the same time
That almost made me cry for real 😢
This makes me so sad. TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES❤️❤️❤️👑👑👑
Rewatching this again after a year hit hard. Seeing my favorite thing end was so sad and emotional. It had so many memories. Goodbye dsmp
14:52 Wish Techno was there for that 😢
why did it shut down?
i’m watching this in 2024, and i honestly can’t believe how far this server has come. i am so sad it’s come to an end, but i know every member will be remembered. dreamsmp has made me laugh so much, and i’m so grateful that i had the privilege to watch you grow up. i wish the whole server the best.
Just realized this was posted the day before my birthday
gonna go cry now :,) <3
Technoblade never dies!!!!!!!
Dream roasted Tommy’s mom so hard lmao 😂
This video hits me😢
Hit me so hard when the video ended and that's when I realized Technoblade's cape and sword were in the background...... Technoblade never dies....
I am not an emotional guy but when he was at techno blades house I almost started to cry I can't believe it has been a year
It hurts because this is the last memory we had of Dsmp… And even though its been rough at times it’s been entertaining to watch in COVID… 😞 I will miss the memories of this server and all of the players in it. But I’m sure that they will still be talking even though the server is down. I will miss it though….
Season 2 dream SMP
i cried throughout this whole video :(
My favorite part of dream smp is when Tommy moved into technos house
Techno probably would have said something like… “ahh man, it’s over already”
°•. Vs. ° • .
"yk yk what tommy" "wsp dream" "i DoNt ReMeMbEr SpAwN bEiNg sO gAy"
16:14 😪

This is sad😢
tommy your not the only one trying to hold there tears, back at techno's... house, I still reamember when techno rosted dream saying "he has a house" I/We all miss him too...

11:02 i was holding back my tears cause my cousin was beside me..😢
Nah the dream ended well😂
Song at the end
Goodbye DreamSMP, you were my everything for this last 2 and a half years... It's time to take a next step and turn this awesome page of my life.
Tommy saying he is the main character made me realise dream yes World record holder DREAM made a phsycotic 16 year old the main character.
14:40 made me die and respawn 💀
When i was little, i wanted to be in the DreamSMP, but when i saw this, my hope is shattered and in the trash, but i will agree this is so sad and funny at the same time, i was laughing crying
wilburslap Georgefoundguilty
To new beginnings
I never see so many people hunting down dragon
Goodbye technoblade
1:26😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Without Technoblade DSMP Feels Nothing Anymore.....

Imagine george just takes his stuff but it is sad to see the OG of the dream smp leave.
goodbye forever dream SMP we will miss you
me?crying? pff no...
I never watched the dream SMP. Always knew about it and kept saying "I will EVENTUALLY start watching", but never actually did. I still got chills when hearing that it ended. Same story with Technoblade. o7
1 year ago…….
16:41 was unexpected that was memorable
That is Tubbo your friend from the dream smp  6:26  I wouldn’t do that Tommy   11:19 stealing is not the part of the dock right Tommy
why did it end...
It’s a little bit sad it is😢❤
Bye bye dream smp
"I never cried on camera before" (not meant to be mean) but the Video "365 Days Without Technoblade" really?
12:17 You can hear him press out the laughter and it sounds like he wants ti cry❤
It's just. Emotional😓
Everyone: jumps into the end portal immediately Callahan: burns silently in lava
16:06 i love the camera angles and then tommy’s smile :)
14:37 i love how george just suddenly appears
man my wish was to get into dream smp but its gone btw my be techno res in peace
Wow
Technoblade never dies, R.I.P 🫡
ending = WOW😢
I remeber when i always watched dream smp. Its come to an end a fucking year ago.
"IM THE MAIN CHARACTER" Sapnap: so thats why im always third wheeling
*The universe said I love you*
Hi TommyInIt
The fact that i started to watch other streams and when i came back i saw this video..
8:01 Seeing Dream in a crown made me pause.  Someone once said “if a person’s name is spoken, that person is not dead.”  So rest in power, Techno.  We wear crowns in your honor.  Thank you for putting them on our heads.
"omg u can ban everyone" (bans himself too)
Goodbye dream smp 🫡  Rip techno 🫡  It was so fun watching all of you’re videos of everyone on the server 🫡
2:45 “BOTTOM TEXT” HELP
o7
Goodbye, dsmp. The d in dsmp is why i hated you, but the t in dsmp is why i why i will always remember you
GGs boys one last stream, im not crying, its just that im washing my eyes.....
Can TommyInnit will ever send me  the world DreamSmp so that I could join................. (:
This hurts to watch now.
tubbo : what is your favourite bit? tommy in his heart and mind : "everything"
I miss Techno now😢
im watching in 2024 and o didn't know they were going to end he dsmp its so sad i almost cried
My favorite part? Techno joining... my least favorite?? The server ending...
Goodbye, dream smp.
why did they end it though
After a year im back and this still breaks me
wait wait wait what hapen
Thank you Dream SMP, you made my childhood. Rest In Peace Technoblade and thank you for the others that have watched this with me since the beginning. Goodbye Dream SMP
I cried-
Sad
First techno  And second Dream smp..
0:20 second rule is crazy💀💀
R.I.P *dream smp*
PLEASE COME BACK
COME PLEASEW
TOMMY  COME
PLEASE COME BACK TOMMY
why tommy leaving come back tommy
Yooo 😩
It brings me joy that Tommy and tubbos character will just be sitting there forever. Watching all of the sunsets, sunrises, just to know that all of those years of building the smp, all the effort has to eventually come to an end. You can of course still log on in a few years, for the memories, and old times sake, but it will never be the same as these years. You guys are all legends and millions upon millions of people enjoy watching these videos everyday. And Tommy, you deserved every second of it.
Good bye dream smp u make my memory's great
11:48 At this part my eyes are sweating
Bro dream voice chage
you can see the sadness in his eyes when he goes to techno's house he just looks empty
FUCK I didn't know that this ended I just thought they stopped it for a while and wow
Good old days 😭
Wish techno could of been here for this moment he would be super proud of all the things all of you went through together
FOR TECHNO!
Techno you will be remember Tommy is probably quitting😢😢😢
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭techno is gone Tommyinnit is quitting nooooooo
Bro The 0:20
That video is epik
Zezus, my first comment is gonna be here. Sitting with all the 13,113 comments. All from this amazing community <3. I only knew of the dream smp around a few months after it ended, im pretty sure, I'm not sure. (I found this place a few weeks after techno's death. i had recently became a fan of his before his death, my brother loved him so i looked into his channel, and eventually i was also looking forward to his uploads.) but the amazing people at almost every turn really had my heart. To whoever my be reading this, wether it be a year, or a few years after this video was posted, i hope you find out what a gem you stumbled upon, and i hope this community loves you just as much as i love it. o7. And Screw Cancer.
😢
im back after 1 year, can't believe its been 1 year! techo never dies! dream smp is closed😭
It hurts all of us still want to see you go tell me I'm really going to miss you so much I'm crying right now as I'm typing this I don't know why I'm watching you for like for a long time and we're all going to miss you I love you so much I'm just so 10 years old and I'm watching your content I will still watch your videos over and over and over and over again and remember all the time
And techno😢❤
Bye Tommy 😢
Rest in peace Techno❤. Bye bye Dream smp Videos❤.
It’s been a year now 😢
Just remembering techno live streaming, and the hypixel potato. Just everything
You can tell the pain in Tommy's laugh when he was going through technos house.
5:29 Makes sense-
Sadly all good things must come to an end
It’s almost technos anniversary… 🐷 👑 we will miss our blood god…. He probably already speed ran taking over the kingdom of god
Sometimes I like to come back and watch this to remember :)
Dsmp really changed my life. It was my comfort in COVID. All the memories and laughter will always be there. It hurts a lot watching this a year later… so many times I felt like absolute shit just to come and watch dsmp vids. It really made a difference in someone day.      When Tommy had visited Technos cabin… it was like, shit.. he’s actually gone.. but I know he’s not. Cause… Techno never dies. He said and I quote “I have ascended to heaven to take on the Kingdom of God.” He caused so much chaos in the server it was hilarious. I miss him everyday. Thank you Tommy for being one of my most favorite idols! (Technos my fav, sorry Tommy) you made the most funniest vids and you still do. I knew dsmp was gonna end at some point. I just didn’t expect time to go by so fast.       Now a year later, I still can’t bear to let go of dsmp. One day, I wanna make a smp of my own. Who knows, maybe I’ll make an impact on people like this smp had on me.. I still watch the dsmp vids. I will forever cherish all those memories that went by so quick.  (Plus, Tommy!! Why’d you make the ending so sad! And dramatic! 😭)
1 Year.
He actually left.
Well, this is an exact year old.
why does dream sound different?
i almost cried and it was wholesome
PLEASE
BRING IT BACK
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  DREAM SMP IS ENDING
I was upset that the dream smp has ended because it was rlly my favourite and funny but I’m accepting the fact that it has ended, rest in peace techno😢
11 months passed still in our hearts

The fact that this has been 11 months and I still miss it😢
The amount of times I almost cried is crazy.
They really saved THE END for the ending of the server 😥 It is also sad that even the greatest player didn't come all the way 😢😢 TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES 😭😭

Technoblade was apart of my childhood but now he's not there I feel abyss In my heart
LONG LIVE TECHNOBLADE 😢❤️🕊

Im crying a year later.
Its almost 1 Year Of dream smp Gone😭
I love the dream smp and it will always have a special place in my heart. Rest easy Techno you also made a big impact ❤
Its still sad that techno’s house is still frozen in time after his death, and even after the closure of the dreamsmp, its still going to be there, maybe untouched for years and years. We miss you Techno. ❤
На самом деле меня очень печалить что в 2020 я не задержалась в фандоме Дрмс.Но теперь я вернулась так поздно.Уже действительно очень больно смотреть это видео , потому что в моей голове до сих пор 2020 и дрсмп у которого ещё столько планов на будущее...Так больео понимать что этого больше нет , особенно больно что в моей голове только живой Техно.. Покойся с миром Техноблейд и Дрим смп.  П.С.написала на русском ибо хотелось бы услышать что думает об этом русская часть фандома
Do u miss him
you me happy
Every good thing comes to an end
Only if techno was there😔
This vidio is the sadest and the funiest ep 4 my life
Every time I watch this video i cry and idk why but i just do
TommyInnit, I really enjoyed this video, so I hit the like button!
This brought me into full-on tears. I loved this series. And I will always remember  it. Thank you for  the finale, Tommy. 🎉
Its been a great time tommyinnit u should be glad thatu even came on the dreamsmp.. Bye dreamsmp, its been a great time. 🥲
Goodbye dream smp and thank you for the amazing times
Almost a year later. And I am SO glad this server existed. So many amazing builds, amazing characters. (And Jack Manifold). I am so happy to say that I got be here during this time. And I can't thank you enough. Cheers, TommyInnit. ❤
R.I.P Technoblade
It's gonna been a year..
About two weeks and it'll have been a year. Damn. Everything was so simple during this time now with all the people who, don't talk anymore or turned out to be not who we thought they were. This was a huge part of me growing up and those two and a half years changed me. For the worse and the better. I discovered myself and actually felt like I belonged to a community. This shaped my lock down and I always feel like i would have been so much more different if I hadn't gotten that one video on my YouTube feed. I'm immensely proud of literally everyone, they've all moved on but it's weird that I can't. I'm attached to this. To all the 2021 irl streams and meetups, before it all went... Sour kind of. I've seen this video and replayed more times than I'd like to admit honestly but I just wanted to say thank you. For shaping me as a person through the fandom, and also making my lockdown, a bit less shitty. The end of the  DSMP, Technoblade never dies ! 🫶🫶🫶
is sooo sad that technoblade is not in the group photos rest in peace technoblade never dies
Well I was being watching dream smp but the comment was late
I remember watching this when it was posted, I shed a tear, and saluted as Tomyinnit logged off.
Seeing technos house. Immediately cried
o7  Heres to the SMP that was my entire childhood. I wish everyone the best.
Why did dream SMP end ? Why not continue it ?
I’m gonna miss the dream smp I have been watching since 2020💔
He says that he never cried. When Tehnoblade died he had a meltdown
R.I.P Techno and the memory’s of the dream smp will still remain
I saw Tommy crying when he visited the techno house it made me cry seeing this end make me cry they are my childhood❤❤❤
FINALLY
boo hoo suck it up
I have two things to say.....one it I very heartbreaking to no longer see techno and two....i always wanted to watch the play on the dsmp but never got to because i was too young...but now....its too late....so I'm now rewatching all of it to live something i always wanted to do but never got to experience it but now I can.... and one more thing....this is for techno! My most favorite thing hes ever said! TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!!❤❤❤❤
Technoblade never dies !!!!!!!!!!!!!
It hit hard  when Tommy whent to technos house and his pets where still thare almost cried
Once a great man said “ TECHNOBLADE  NEVER Dies “
Tommy:hey look I can ban everyone  OH NO
I most literally bawled my eyes out watching you hit the disconnect button. And thinking about technoblade and just everyone in general. All the times I’d be in darkest moments and watch your new uploads on the dream smp and just smile again. I’m crying whole typing thjs so excuse the bad grammar, it’s the tears. Thank you Tommy. You saved me from a lot of things. I always smile watching your content, even if it won’t be on the smp anymore. and I think I speak for all of us when I say thank you for bringing joy into our lives when we most needed it. Even behind a screen millions of miles away giving out millions of smiles worldwide.   Thank you.
It has been already a few years that technoboade was gone......technoblade never dies!!!!
Goodbye, Dream SMP              TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES   I'll never forget those 3 words 😢 fly high Technoblade
nah tommyinnit visiting techno's base for one last time hits different
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH goodbye dream smp😭😭😭❤❤❤❤❤
This is so sad 😢😢
I think Skyblock at its core is the ultimate challenge in resource management. You spawn on a tiny island in an empty universe. All you have is a tree, some supplies and some dirt to stand on. You have to treasure EVERY dirt block, because if one falls into the void, there's no way to replace it and as you carefully navigate your absurd circumstance, you gain a new appreciation for the few things you have as you meticulously use them to their fullest effect. With nothing but some ice, lava and saplings you slowly transform this empty expanse into a world of your very own. Skyblock teaches us that no matter how ridiculous the odds may seem, within us resides the power to overcome these challenges and achieve something beautiful. That one day, we'll look back at where we started and be amazed by how far we've come. Technoblade
Why did everyone suddenly start quitting?
The end of an era and the end of a legend
Almost been a year… I really miss it’s prime ngl

Goodbye dream smp😊
I love the Dream SMP. Thanks for the memories i have watching you Tommy.
Whomp whomp
Watching his first video when he joined the Dream SMP after I watched this video made me very emotional 😢
end of the begining
I miss everything sm rn but the worst part is looking back on all the memories and remembering what Will did to Shelby. It hurts so badly to think about. I've been watching since 5th grade, watching DSMP was how I grew up. It's almost a year now. I miss Techno, I miss the way things were, but I guess the point of this video was to prove all good things, eras, and peaks come to an end. The whole reason 'goodbye' videos are made is to prove that you're growing up, moving on, when in truth none of us want to move on :,)
Rewatching this again ever since it was first uploaded, I realized that...everything isn't as it used be now...everything has changed, some for the better, and some for the worst. But even so, I thank all of you, and I mean ALL of you for sharing all these fond memories with me and the other fans. I miss this, this is will always have a special place in my heart.
ramboo is the main
Good bye dream smp 😞
Goodbye dream smp 😢
*crying* why did you have to do this
i was here for the beginning but i wasn’t here till the end. I stopped watching the DreamSMP mid 2022, but always had the memories. Thank you for everything
Go visit technos dad
17:15 i guess this is why they get shipped
I can see the emotional when u go to  techno house man😢
All good things have to come to a end. )':
bro wrote a essay for bad
tommy watched his whole friend group go into flames
*crashes door* “Hey I’m depression!” “BANG, YOUR DEPRESSED TOO”
Don't mind me crying after 10 months still I AM IMAGINING TECHNO SAYING goodbye Everyone while his soul is in the smp living happily with his pets but alone...
Ip server Dream
This hit different, knowing that Techno is gone and many members are growing up. This really was a emotional video
Dream SMP raised millions of us.  Thank you for everything :')
Technoblade never dies!
bro the disc made me cry
Dream SMP was the most fun thing that I have seen in my entire life. I literally cried while watching this video. Till now I didnt realise that the DreamSMP had been closed. This was an important experience of my life. The part that hit me the most was when Tommy went into Technos house and he wasnt there. RIP Techno and Goodbye DreamSMP, for the first and the last time.
Goodbye, Dream SMP
f**k dream smp
Oh man
*Tommy just casually sucking his mic while talking to Dream* Dream: " was that your mother tommy"💀 Tommy: "WHAT!?"🤡
And now dream George and Will are s3x ofenders cuz Tommy read how to s3x😊
Seeing him expressing everything about the server then going over to techno's house makes me heart hurts.
last war on the dream smp
This made me cry so much😢
Female dog *

Why did the dream SMP go?
The fact it’s almost been 1 year.
DO I HEAR DREAM SMP 2.0???
Let the allegations begin
Techno’s stuff in the thumbnail really did it for me. I got sad, because dsmp ended, but they really can’t join the server every now and then, just for themselves? :(. dream smp and the people in it made up most of me, and I’m sad to see it go. Goodbye dream smp, rest in peace technoblade. O7❤
Goodbye Dream SMP😢😢😢😢
Goodbye 🥲😛
Goodbye dream smp Ik I’m late but GOODBYE
I was on the edge of balling my eyes out-
it really hit me realizing that techno will never live to see this moment ever...a eternal race that will never be finished.... WE LOVE YOU TECHNO <3
Don't you remember Techno Tommy
I use to watch dsmp videos daily in early 2022 to the end of 2022 and stopped watching after awhile revisiting some of the youtubers I use to watch daily is so amazing it’s sad that it came to an end and that I’m also late but I’m glad I’ve started watching tommyinnit and other people like that again
i forgot techno died then just got a beat in the soul... god damn rest in peace techno-

I missed techno sm rip technoblade.
10 months passed... i really miss this

Lemme tell y’all now technoblade was rebirth okay so he might be like “I wish I was in the dreamSMP” ❤
Sadly it’s is true that Technoblade wasn’t there😢 I think he helped all of us even if you didn’t know it. I think he would be watching us from the sky and be proud that he impacted so many people. I didn’t know him until he passed but he still impacts me to this day😅 Rest in peace Technoblade, Technoblade never dies.
Thats all folks...
“ShOoT tHe WoMaN iN tHe SkY” is crazy.
Goodbye it was fun while it lasted
Almost a year,and still miss The Prime in DreamSmp Vids,the humor and the people in the smp were unique and had a special place in my heart ❤❤
The finale would have been 1000 times more funnier with techno
I'm disappointed Drista wasn't there for the finale
the fuck happened to dreams voice
It has end...
funny thing is tommy told to tubbo he never cried on stream but when he entered technos house i saw how hard he held back his tears rest in peace Technoblade💔
It’s been 9 months… 😢  RIP 🪦
For 10 years of watching dream smp i thought there is no end but every beginning has an end like techno my grandma my mom but now the smp of my childhood is falling bit by bit I think my childhood is falling apart first matpat and techno then every bit of my childhood is falling apart as im writing this comment im very sad most of the channels i watch when i was a kid is now not uploading im sad to say this but      " it is what it is you     can't change it but if you except the end there is a new beginning ".
Goodbye it was nice to see you all goodbye.....................
It'd be kinda cool if tom ever decides to retire, he went back and took a look into the DreamSMP. If he still has access to it. Rest in peace Techno.
❤
Rip 😭😭😭👋
Goodbye Dream SMP. Thank you for everything. ❤
Coming back for like the again, I’ve been avoiding this video cause it just hurts so much but I just want to say, Dream Smp will never truly end. We will all keep the fandom alive, or at least I will till death. I’ve been there from the beginning and will be to the end. I will be just like them when i grow up. Long live Dream Smp.
4:44 bro watching this moment makes me think of Maze Runner
Even if dsmp ended 9 months ago i still watch it to this day because this is really really what kept me in company during pandemic i will be sad on my birthday because it'll be the one year anniversary that dsmp is "officially gone" 😢
Oh
L
Of all the good times, it has came to an end😢

im so sad guys🧢
This made me cry😭
9 months passed i still love dream smp
I miss Techno so much...
9 almost 10 months now. It hits me so hard that the DSMP is now gone. That Techno, the man that never dies, the man that chooses blood, is dead, but not in our hearts! His home and pets will forever remain there, and will wait for him for eternity. That the DSMP started back in April of *2020,* an ended, in April *2023.* That Tommy is what practically started the big DSMP server. The *’hate’* Clay (Dream) and Tommy had, turning into friendship over the years, when in reality, Clay said that adding Tommy to the SMP was the best thing ever did, though he acts like he hated Tommy being on SMP. The DSMP members, will always remember this server of theirs. As will all the viewers that joined and left over years. We will all remember this server, *as* *our* *own!!*  May we let Alex rest in peace, and watch over not only his family, but the other members of the DSMP, the server, his pets, his house, and let’s not forget, his follower. We love you Technoblade. Don’t forget, “TECHNO NEVER DIES BABY!”  “I CHOSE BLOOD!” - Technoblade / Alex, at the battle of the lake. October 5, 2020.
NAH NOT THE FIRST DSMP VIDEO BEING RECOMMENDED TO WM AFTER THIS
Man imma miss this server!!!
Dream smp And techno Gone But not forgotten
Dream smp gone but not forgotten
I've made a promise to myself that i will be in this fandom 4ever and ever. I have left it in febuary 2023, and in december 2023 i was like "hey. These people have changed my live, even the ones that i haven't watched. I wonder how that ended" And now, after almost a year passed since the dream smp ended i have watched this.  If not Fundy pushing Jack off the bridge i would not be here right now.  I joined the fandon April 8th 2021.  It has been almost 3 years since.  I wish Drista would be at the finale too, same as techno.
It has been 9 months? I haven't watched it
Only the real ones started crying
I'm proud of Dream And Tommy And BadBoyhalo and Everyone Else I cried when it's ending something When it like for years And This is the last video ever it really hurts me Techno My Most favorite YouTuber Had passed away At The final Goodbye Dream Snp ☹️☹️
Rip Techno
8 months later,ive only just gotten into the dsmp and its sad that its ended but it still lives on. Goodbye,Dream SMP. Rip,Techno. ❤  (Also i love where tommy references there being two different versions of himself at 4:31; those two versions being c!tommy and *tom* tommy)      "Don't cry because it's over,smile because it happened."  -a wise person. 🥲🥲😔😔
Good bye Dream SMP 😨😰😢😭😓😥😣😖😔😓
We will miss dream sm❤😢
Noooo cant they still continue? 🥺🥺😭
Goodbye DSMP. Thank you for all the good memories.
8 months, everybody on the server is still in my heart, especially techno ❤❤
Technoblade never dies

That really touched my heart
I cried the whole time

Tears almost went to my eyes when techno died…. Techno never dies….
im a bit late but i just sobbed watching this rip techno
I am going to rewatch every episode of the dream smp on all the members channels
It hurts so bad when you realise this is gonna be the last dsmp video ever made. We all have wonderful memories about these series.  It may be over, and Techno passed away, but we will remember these moments forever <3  (just for knowledge, i cried while writing this)
Can anyone tell me the name of the music that was at the end of the vid. It has been a long time since i last heard it.

😢❤❤❤🎉🎉🙂👍
Bro, I don't remember when I laughed so much last time. And I'm in this community for not even a week
Thanks to everyone for everything

Rest in peace Tecnho😭♥️🕊️🕊️
Seeing everyone going online in the dream smp but it hits hard that Technoblade is the only one not there 😢 R.i.p Technoblade ❤
Dream SMP changed my life...  Good bye and rest in peace techno;(( (Im late)
Tommy, it was a big part of you because.... This was the last place Techno logged on The Blade will never die, he will be forever remebered
i forgot to comment this but dsmp saved me from my bad mental health and made me happy. i am sad that it ended :[
Ik I’ve never watched the dsmp things yet but this hits way too hard bc it’s where everyone basically met each other and grew together and Technoblade never dies. ❤️
I remember when Tommy was exiled I caught up on the dream smp just to impress this girl I liked who loved this series and we talked about it
damn
The dream smp changed my hole life after I got cheated on and broken but when I was told about the dream smp it made me sooo happy and I cried watching that vid and I need more cause I'm depressed again pls comeback

Damn i can't believe its gone!
Tommy look in his eyes made me cry when i watch this eight months ago and still makes me cry watching this rip dream smp and rip techno💔
O7

11:21 techno still exists
I didn’t expect to cry watching this
This is my favorite YouTube series I’ve ever watched and it makes me sad that it’s over now. And in my opinion, it was the best YouTube season ever.
Tommy dont stop posting vids you vids make me laugh so hard i almost dided😂😂😂😂
Tell dream i said i want to join the smp
Technoblade Never dies
Ik Im kinda late but Dream SMP really lightened me up during covid
Uhh i think he failed because the smp is still here in 2023 December 31
When you realise DSMP Ended 8 nearly 9 months ago.
The dream smp: Dream was defeated. Techno died. Tommy killed Dream. Tobby killed the ender dragon. Dream got betrayed. Dream got prisoned in his own server. Dream got betrayed. Dream teamed up with Tommy, Dream thought he was the main character. Dream got killed by a train. Dream is litterly a threat wth. Dream is deadlier than death or ban bruh.
I found the DreamSMP eight months after it ended. I seriously at the time didn't even know that it had ended yet, so when i found the final stream, i literally cried for like 20 minutes. I feel so damn guilty that I hadn't found it earlier. I wish the SMP the best of luck, and remember,   FUCK CANCER
O7 👇
Ahhh. A trip down memory lane...i remember watching this. It was my birthday when it came out and i was so happy..but sad at the same time... The dsmp was and is part of my life. It has made me become the person i am today...thank you for these wonderful oppurtunitys in this life...thank you Dsmp...Bee out.  -Bee, a fan
You can just hear the sadness in his laugh when he vizited technos house
I don't even care it hasn't been that long but we need a dsmp come back
Me watching it again and its about to be 2024 and its still hits hard that techno is no longer with us
Another win for us. FUCK DREAM!
1 Last time? 1 no more 1 gone...
Rest in peace dream smp Rest in peace Technoblade
Hey anybody know where we can download the final version of the dream smp world?
i wish techno couldve seen this and yeah thank you tommyinnit for making the dream smp a part of us🥲
Goodbye dream smp.
This will never be forgotten,never in a thousand years,ten thousand,a hundred thousand,nor a million,a very memorable moment.
Don't be sad because I ended be happy because it happens
Byeee
Good bad😢😢😢😢 👋
Holy shit this was damn fucking good rip dreamsmp and techno i remember watching urs and technos stream i even downloaded maps of the smp so I can fell what u feel goodbye Tommy and everyone else in the dream smp
🧢 2:08
I'm about to cry. Tommy or any of the dsmp members were the kind of YouTubers my mom never allowed me to watch but I watched anyways... I will never forget the contribution this server had in my life. Thank you. Thank you for everything. For getting me out of depression. For being my comfort zone. And for being with me when no one else wanted to.  One last goodbye from me❤
In this video there is only love joy and memories it a long been a long way
When men cries
I love when Tommy looked up at the camera when he was about to hop in the portal in the end
Unfortunately i didnt fully watch this until the end when thei first released idk why its sad its ending but be glad it happened. Sucks how some werent in there like quackity, ranboo, Sapnap, wilbur, fundy and etc. Even maybe Lazarbeam. But most of all Technoblade. We will always miss Techno may he rest in peace. TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!
why didn’t sadist animate this
Good bye dream smp😢.
Techno always wanted to do this😔
i miss techno so much
This is making me cry
This is making me cry
One of THE BEST series that i was consistently following since past 3 godly years......................altho our timezones didnt matched, i would always whenever possible would look to up to you all and will do it in the future as well, be it the annoyance of Tommy, or the big iq of the Og Dream, or the voice of the man who used to literally creep the fk out of orphans THE BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD (rest in power alex), or be it the intense hardwork put in by the Wilbur Soot in his extraordinary roleplaying, or be it the silly goofy aahh goons such as Big Q and tubbo (How can we forget the supreme advocate BIG T eyyyyyyyy) or MY FAVOURITE JONATHAN  FuCKING SCHLATT, even tho his time in the server was prbly the lowest but had a very huge impact in the smp rp as well as in my life like humour, fun, the silly mood changes and what not. I was in 9th standard when i started watching you and now i m in 12th, its been 3 years man and yes tommy at first I found you pretty annoying but after gaining some interest and after sometime i started liking cuz you gave the same vibes as the young silly fella who often gets bullied by his friends but also has a great bonding apart from it.....................THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL THE DREAM SMP CHAR WHO HAD PUT IN EFFORTS AND SHAPING MY TEENAGE LIFE INTO AN ABSOLUTE FUN EXPERIENCE and again tommy, you are a very great person i thank you especially to put so much efforts to entertain us and will prbly meet in the future that for you  and once again..... SUCKKKKKKKK IT GREEEEEEENNNNNNNN BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII :) LONG LIVE L'MANBURG❤❤
This hits hard,
This was so sad for me (yes I’m like really late to watching this I was in denial) but this truly did just mark the end of apart of my life and like I made so many great friends through this community and I ended up losing all of them so it’s weird to think that idk it’s just over officially dsmp will always be important to me (even tho I stopped watching it a while ago) and thank you for everything
Farewell,thank you for all of the great times,great laughs. Dream SMP changed my life,and I will always be greatful for that. Rest in Peace Technoblade,you will never be forgottten...
I remember watching this video yesterday, and its already 8 months ago. How
CRYING, SOBBING, PUKING, SHARTING BRICKS BRO
thank you dream smp. Rest in peace, techno. i honestly cried while while watching this
(╯_╰)
Wow we all figured out what was the center of the “Dream SMP” it was Technoblade
I'm still searching through this whole lore about 'why The dream SMP got shut down' and the whole entire history and can someone gimme a link to read about the lore
You know i feel sad Ph1lz not there😢
why did it say read how to sex on his bucket list 💀💀
GOODBYE DREAM SMP  AND GOODBYE TECHNO  TECHNO NEVER DIES😭
I love how tommy smiled so softly knowing this is the last dreamSMP stream
Dont be sad its gone... Be happy it happend <3 you know the dsmp will always and always stay in my heart there is no way it will be gone i am very thankfull for all of it and rip techno
thank you, so much. i was in a  really fucking hard situation and watching your streams of th DSMP helped me. of course, every good thing has an end. thank you
WHAT AN ERAAAA
dream sounds a bit different in this one
Congrats, you have made me cry
It was a wild ride wasn't it 😏
i was tearing up
that is sad
It wasn’t the same without techno😢
Is dream ok about this💀
When the video ended YouTube recommended me to watch tommy joining the smp for the first time😭😭😭
16:44 the amazing times pass by so fast…
Farewell DSMP
This brings back so many memories 😭😭😭😭it’s literally so sad it’s over
What an amazing journey it was
It is really sad that techno died 😢😢😢 I miss him every single day
Realistically, techno is totally joking about his own death rn. RIP
Please back the dream smp😢
my fav part:  1:35 - "who is this BITCH? on my LAWN" HAHAHHAHAH
Good memories. Will not be forgotten. R.I.P Techno.
I wish I here for it all. I joined the Dream SMP community super late, almost at the end. Right now, I  know most of the lore, and obsessed with some of the youtubers that were in it. Goodbye Dream SMP, and hello to more videos to come.
I can’t left that
when is season 2
Im just imagining that techno soloing the ender dragon if he was there to join
Didn’t realize it until the ending, but the dsmp was a part of my childhood. Even if I’m not proud to say it was (bc I was cringy) it still shaped who I am today. And it’s weird seeing that go away.
I'm not crying your crying
😢😢😢😢
Goodbye  smp
I wish i got to see the DSMP finale went it was posted 7 months ago. I stopped watching anything about the DSMP 2 years ago because i thought it fell off but now i regret making that decision and i wish i could've kept seeing my favorite youtubers play on this SMP longer but i guess thats not happening any time soon. Oh how things pass by quick and i wished that the other members were here for the finale as well ESPECIALLY Technoblade, I'd argue he made the best moments on this little server "You wanna be a hero tommy? THEN DIE LIKE ONE", "I'm ready for revolution", "Welcome home Theseus", "I choose Blood", "I GOT A PICKAXE AND I PUT IT THROUGH YOUR TEETH QUACKITY" we're all gonna miss that little damn Rebel. Not to mention the War for the Discs, the War for L'lmanburg's Independence, King Eret's Betrayal, President Schlatt's takeover, Revolution of L'lmanburg, Tommy's Exile, Technoblade's Execution, The Egg, the Final War of L'lmanburg, Tommy and Tubbo's final Showdown against Dream, The Prison and now The Dream SMP Finale. I'm glad I managed to see this rag tag group of Creators make a series for many people to enjoy including myself and I wish to have cherished all of it to the very End
Dont be sad because it ended, be happy that it happend
Ok i rather see the dream smp in fortnite
Man the memories i saw with tommy playing in dream Smp has ended
I heard there was a special place.. :(
Tommy is the kind of person that would get everyone to log off at the exact same time and log off one second earlier to piss everyone off😅
2:44 pay attention to the subtitles it says "Bottom Text" for a sec 🤣
and by the way rest in peace techno..
my god it's rlly sad then the end of dream smp i rlly love it so much because i am they fan so much fan of them.. i guess it's late to say Goodbye.
I am emotional I miss technoblade
Looking at tommy while he enters techno's house just made my heart break. Ps: it took then 2 or more years and almost 14 people to kill a dragon
i started watching the smp in 2021 when tommy was around i think 2 mill i was 11 he was the funniest yt thanks tommy now ima go watch  some demon slayer hentai
funnily enough, this fandom led me to meeting my partner of multiple years, who i want to marry and build a life with. as crazy as this era was, i’m incredibly grateful for it. for the late nights and the discord servers and the art, songs and community that came from it. so thank you. and of course, rest in peace technoblade, whose content kept me going through the worst times.
Why did dsmp close
Bro know now He is too stupid 6:27  lol
This is best  thing  in my  life ,  l still  miss  the Dream smp,  l have  all the  memories  l love  you Tommy and  many  others !
o7
17:10 aged like fine wine
I’m just rewatching this and I finally remembered why I cried the first time I’ve seen it  It’s because they killed the dragon Without techno And Tommy visited technos house
for the last time...goodbye dsmp...and good bye 2023- in a few weeks the dsmp will be finally left behind with 2023 and there will be soooooo many people who will 100% cry lmaooooo..but anyways, i will miss the dsmp-goodbye !!

🫡goodbye DSMP, you will be missed
Am not crying you are 😭😭😭😭😭
Watching this in 2023 and i still get tiers from watching this. Without this server and the content made on it covid would have been the worst years of my life. And the fact that Technoblade wasn’t in the screenie always makes me shead a tier
The memories that Dsmp made will forever remain in my heart and soul. So sad it ended but it was great throughout 2020 and 2021 but for now…it’s ended forever R.I.P Technoblade
Thanks for all the memories
I grew up with the DreamSMP. Thank all of the youtubers that built up my life. Tommyinnit, Tubbo, Wilbur, Philza, Dream, Quackity, Shlatt, Fundy, George, Bad, Sapnap, Ranboo, and Techno. Thank you so much.   We will all remember Technoblade. Miss you everyday.
I may not have been here for the dsmp or for when techno was still here but I’m happy it all happened.  Fly high Technoblade. Fly high.   Goodbye dream smp. <333
Get on randomly to surprise everyone
So long ago. 7. Months.  2-- no.. maybe 3? I lost count of how many years.  It started as a simple survival world with friends  to a conflicting, lore filled and dramatic server.  I, so does everyone else, miss Techno. If only he had managed to beat cancer, he couldve had the chance to say goodbye to the server and beat the dragon with everyone else. Blood for the blood god ❤  To tommy and everyone else. Dont cry because its over, be happy that it had happened and occured in your life. Thank you for all the experiences and the laughs. Im so excited for whats to come.
technoblade didnt get to see the end...
Good riddance
NGL this server also brings more memories back to me, my ex and I usually watched DSMP stream back then and we also play MC together with friends and then well life happens. She found someone better.
7 months have passed and in still gonna cry bc its over RIP techno 🕊️🕊️
Goodbye Dream SMP, the server that changed lives. o7
Don't cry because it ended be happy because it happend.
:')
❤
rip dream smp :(
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹❤
Ngl, this video just hits diff man. No more Dream SMP videos/streams, Techno passing away, just different man.
tommy canonically dies at the end of the dsmp
i did not watch dream SMP series but this was one of the most sad videos ive ever seen
wow 7 months and it felt like 7 secs
Cya Tommy, Thank you for the vids
Group pic only 1 great person was missing...............
TOMMY FEED TECHNOS PETS YOU TWAT GET BACK ON !!!❤❤❤
It's been a year for the dream SMP but it's hard to see that dream SMP ends 😢but   So long dream SMP Rest in piece techno
L’manburg will always live on! Farewell. (I know I’m late)
Rest in peace dream smp and rest in peace technoblade -jake
I’m going to be honest that last 3 minutes left me in tears. Hard to see this go away. I was never really into the dream smp but I started to watch it and now that it’s over I wish I had watched more.
I'm fucking so sad the SMP is gone now
Bro when he hit the button I cried 😭
it was amazing until techno died and the dream smp got ended but we all know it has to come to that end
o7
Tommy to dream: I need to set up stuff Tommy to Sam: dream asked me to set up stuff *everyone dies* Tommy to Sam: my keyboard broke up with me Tommy to dream: Sam banned me
Honestly burst out into tears.. like ugly crying
The dream smp was one of the best things that happened to me. It was and still is my childhood. It got me through my lowest and highest points and I’m so grateful I will always remember the dream smp, R.I.P techno blade but techno never dies.. I love you, dream smp, goodbye.
dreams voice became deeper 😭
Techno died before the smp even ended...
As they say: “ you never know the true value of a moment… until it becomes a memory”
2:43 - Bottom text
I still want technoblade back):
i love all of the dsmp content every dsmp member made im going to miss it so much.  but hey what is best is the memories you all made for the last 2 years i really enjoyed watching your videos tommy -Nakahari spam "poggers in replies"  | \/
If only Technoblade was there😢😢😢
When I started watching the dsmp, I didn’t really think of it ending. But 7 months ago, it happened..
“Stop crying, it’s just the end of a legendary SMP”
techno never got to see the end.
I dont think ill ever forget the times that watching Tommy's videos that always made me burst out if laughter. But now, this made me cry a bit. Techno's death got me, he was one of my favorites. I miss him dearly. Watching the smp was kinda like an escape from reality from me, because of covid and all. Ill miss everything, but I'm glad I saw all of it happen. <3
Why did tommy say the last two years of his life has come to an end?💀
Gay Gay
Damn Technoblades house that uh that got to me......
Technoblade never dies
I didn't realise until today, And I actually stopped watching DSMP... After C! Dreams death. I barely even followed the plot after C!Wilbur's death in L'manburg........ And holy shit, I'm gonna cry. This was one of the major parts of my life, and all of you have helped me through so much.  Fucking hell dream you pissy boy, Why no season 2?  Edit : I sobbed
The coolest thing that could possibly happen is that Dream comes back from the dead and takes back control little by little and then Tecnho teams with Dream and they pick off the whole server one by one. Than Dream brings Tommy back and then gives the final speech and kills him. Then it ends. Forever. Tecnho and Dream slowly fade away. And then the world is empty for the rest of forever. Than Dream comes back (RIP Tecnho) and sees the sever for the real last time and tan deletes the server on stream.
This almost made me cry even watching the real stream but I love the fact that tommy still cares about the Legend the One never can be replaced and even never dies    Technoblade👑🐷
0:05  lake?  don’t you mean…    CADILAC?
i just BALLED MY EYES OUT. ALL THE MEMORIES, ALL THE LAUGHS, ALL BAD AND GOOD MOMENTS DURING QUARANTINE WERE IN THE CENTER OF THIS.   For that i thank you tommyinnit, ive been here since the very beginning and im proud to say i was here to see it end 🫶
I'M CRYING😭😭😭

Rest in peace technoblade ❤❤❤
90s kids have nothing on this

At first I thought no fucking way no. But life carries the fuck on and doesn't stop for you. I fucking cried. I know I wasn't In that sever but the memories man they bring a bloody tear. I hope this is my mark as I final goodbye and a start to something incredible goodbye Dream SMP.    - *my name* 2023. 🫶🎉❤️🥲 :')
This is so emotional I love the DSMP I just knew about it and it already ended..I wish everyone could still play together :):::
I cried ngl
Its so sad I'm crying😭😭😭😭
I remember covid i used to watch the dream smp so much and then i just stopped one day but when i saw this i couldnt click on it. My humor,my personality,my use of swear words and my happiness all came from this i cant belive its done now but atleast i can still enjoy rewatching old videos. Goodbye dsmp ill always love you and thank you for everything if i hadnt have known about this then i think i wouldnt be as great as a person as i am today. Goodbye  -cacti
Farewell Dream SMP. Farewell...
That tecno moment hit hard
It took me 6 months to watch this because i wasn't ready for this chapter of my life to be over. See you all in the next chapter  o7 boys, maybe it was meant to be
one of the best smp.  the dream smp
I never really watched DSMP, but now that it's gone, and I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW AND JUST RANDOMLY FOUND THIS VIDEO, I just cant... 💔   Rest in piece, Dream SMP.   I know for a fact, that when I say that DSMP will be severely missed, that I'm speaking for everyone, Fans, People who have just heard/seen it, and many else.  Also, rest in Piece, Technoblade.   You left us far too soon.
WHY DID I CRYYYYY AHHHHHHHHH
Tommy dream ask your self this would techno want this server to end no he would not so don't let it die let him live on in the server please bring it back for technoblade
whay r u leveing the DREAM SMP
Made me cry to know that techno isnt here, at least thats what we think.. he is always here for his Dresm SMP family.. two years of everyones lives of joy and laughter... You know how it goes.. don't cry because it ended, smile because it happend..
im not crying... i got something in my eyes... heheheh
damn... this hit hard.
If only techno could've been in the final group photo
make dream smp 2.0 dedicated to technoblade
6 Months gone, Changed my life for the better. Miss it, And miss you, The blade.
6 months since it ended and it still doesnt feel real. I miss it <33
I wanna cry
I was there from the start and it will always be in my heart. Ranboo was one of the best ppl and also the nicest. Tommy is that annoying sibling but if someone hurts them ud get mad. Tubbo is bees. Dream is still an idiot <3 and george is gay. Nicki is german which for me makes her very special cus im from germany. Fundy is the awesome fox that can code. Jschlatt once died while he was drunk. Quackity still has simps including me. Jack manifold is BALD. Hannah is funny :3 Philza is dadza. Wilbur is still making music. Puffy is being called a puzzy by tommy- (love you captain puffy! Stay strong!) Sapnap is still getting bishes. Skeppy is simping for bad boy halo. Bad boy halo is simping for skeppy. Slime is as strong as ever. Tina is slaying till this day. And techno was a legend.. (i missed purpled, punz, BoomerNA, Seapeekay and more because i dont know anything about them-)
"Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened”  -Dr Seuss - Kids Can Fly.
Did he quit
Finally
I'm not crying you are
Dude,  I have been a fan of dsmp since 2021, I was so obsessed of watching dream,  gnf,  ranboo and you. It's sad that it has come to an end,  I'm never going to forget all of you and technoblade. I love you,  DSMP.  You have my whole heart.
6 months past and it's still in my heart I miss the dream Smp I hope this countines but it's the end..
"I love you so"
6 months passed dsmp still in my heart its sad that dsmp was what got my life happy and its gone. and Technos passing even worse...dsmp will be in my heart forever
Don't be sad its gone, be happy it existed.  Thank you Tommy.
Finally, yall were so annoying to watch 😂
Best memories ever🎉
bitter sweet ending
The thumbnail has someone at far left 😔
Everything thing changed after the death of Techno.. Rest in peace, King.. Goodbye forever, DSMP...
6:48 you just used @a means all players
I’m not the only one who went crying 😭
the dream smp group photo without the main person who could made that so much funnier. rest in peace technoblade.
Anyone know what music was playing when they were fighting the ender dragon?
Wow all the memories iv had watching these _😢_
6 months past and im still crying
Commas change everything. Example: “What is a sex mom” “What is a sex, mom?”
This has made me cry Lol
I'm watching this back in November and in sobbing watching it
Its hard to say good bye
Dream SMP..... Changed my life... Im 11 years old now.. i watched your videos when i was 8-9... This is very happy and sad at the same time.... Holy shit....... May jesus bring you luck tommy. Simons. May god give you luck.
End of an era: DreamSMP……

Coming back to this video after a while, still got me in tears lol  I remember finding about dsmp during the 2nd exile, I remember it like it was yesterday.  I remember being shocked about the fact that the dawn of 16th happened on my birthday lol  Dsmp really became a big part of my life, I'm happy I started watching it, it really made me smile during hard times
I miss it
Why did you kill a bee🥺
wish i  could play in premium server and have a prem account
it's been 6 months but this episode of deram smp will never forgeted
WHY DOES DREAM SOUND SO DIFFERENT
Rewatching this made me cry more and harder, The dreamsmp means alot to me I've been attached to it since it started, it changed my personality and also made me finally find out what i want to be,
a new gen has come for us which is the qsmp and i hope people in this gen is awsome dream smp has changed lives and techno never dies this is also 11/2/2023 goodbye the great dream smp you've changed my life and many others

“Jesus Niki, I have a girlfriend”   -Tommyinnit 2023
5 months have passed and we have lost another og, Stampy's Lovely World :(
Why is it ended?
In 10 years most of us will look back at these videos with nostalgia and remembering the good days when they watched DSMP live during or after school.
you know.. I would've enjoyed this video, but I was very upset that Technoblade didn't get to be there when you guys killed the dragon :(
If you told past tommy that techno would die, he wouldnt believe you.
I will forever miss the DSMP server and l'manburg, it has changed my life multiple times and I am so proud of you TommyInnit and other Dream SMP members. It is sad to see you all go and especially TechnoBlade. You all have made me so proud to the journies you guys have been through. And I am so proud of you Tubbo and the rest of the members for beating the Enderdragon. I will miss you all very much, It is hard to see you all go but the end was worth it. I've discovered the Dream SMP since like 2020. I was probably 8 or 9. I am very young of age but, Just know that I am so proud of you all. It is hard to see you all go but. It was all worth it because you have changed my life forever and ever. I will really miss you more than my mother. Haha jk. I will obviously miss her more. I love you all guys, and girls, Once again, I love you all and I will miss you. SO LONG DREAM SMP! <3333333333333333333 3333333333 e3333333333
6 months passed and this was the best SMP ever! This SMP will always be in my heart
WHY DOES THIS ALLWAYS MAKE ME CRY!
My favorite part of this finale besides tommy listening to his discs one last time 15:19
The Technoblade bit had me in tears, he was truly one of the stars of dream SMP and I would have loved to meet him one day. R.I.P Techno, and goodbye Dream SMP 🥲

Saddest part is Techno not being here wish Technodad had hopped on and played and got the final hit
Goodbye dream SMP you shall be missed ❤️❤️

The sword with a cape got me crying when I saw the thumbnail
The way the server is dead it hits hard for me all those wars funny moments with techno,philza and more this was my favorite server to watch in youtube and rip our legend Techno goodbye Dream Smp.😢
Techno blade never dies                                                   - technoblade
It would be more amazing if Technoblade was there to kill the Ender dragon
Dont be sad it ended, be happy it happend in the first place. - wise man
Dont be sad that it endet be happy it happend.
I cant express in words just how much Tommy and the dream smp saved my life when it was my darkest days Tommy was there to help me through them watching his streams really helped me live and escape my reality I will forever miss my dream smp era but I am so glad to be out of it and healthy and watching this video after not watching for awhile has brought so many happy memories I am so glad I lived and I am so grateful to Tommy and the dream smp for being my family during covid when I didn’t have one. Rip technoblade I will forever be grateful for you
Dream died?
o7
Goodbye dream smp
The Dream SMP will be loved by  everyone
I can’t get over it and it’s been 1 year and 4 months he had a huge impact on my life and it’s just been hard to believe he’s actually gone and he’s not coming back I am crying this hits me deep I am still in denial I’m waiting for him to come back but I know he won’t. Deep inside. This all feels so surreal to me and I can’t even imagine how his family feels still I know his dad posted yesterday and it was so sweet of him but I don’t think that I can’t watch this stuff anymore without thinking of him it just all feels awful I get sick thinking hes dead. Thank you for reading.
TOMMY GO INTO THE WORLD SAVE AND RELEASE THE EGG
I am crying
"Don't be sad that it ended, be happy that it happened." Goodbye DreamSMP
o7
Don’t be sad because it ended be happy because it happened
Is been 6 months...wow
I just realised I attempted to get in the dream smp late 💀
Poor technobabble he wasn’t here for the end of the dream Smp:(
whens dream smp 2
i was there from the beginning, and I enjoyed every second of it
Can you plsa go bak
I was avoiding this stream, this video and that day.. I never expected to get so emotionally invested in a smp, but the lore, the characters, and the friendships were just amazing I’m gonna miss it 😭❤️
6 months has passed, and still i watch tommy's DSMP streams, the DSMP has a special place in my heart
6 months has passed, and still i watch tommy's DSMP streams, the DSMP has a special place in my heart
The song hits hard. I wish you guys united.
Love you😢😢
Yey
Dsmp help me with all of my hard times I’m very sad to see it go:(
I’m not crying your crying 😢
man i really wanted the dsmp map to play in :(
I’ve been putting off watching this for so long and it brought so many tears. I’ve been here since the beginning of covid and wow so much has changed I’ll miss it and I have missed it but it helped me grow as a person from 11 to 14 (talk about character development) I miss it all but we have to make way for new memories. Thank you for everything, all of you. ❤
I almost cried watching this, I watched every DSMP video over and over till a new one was posted. Now it's gone, nearly two and half years is gone. All of it. Everything. My childhood.. time to watch every DSMP video again. I'm gonna love it, it'll bring back memories for sure.
I haven't seen a dream smp video in a year... or a video MADE BY TOMMY I FEEL OLD
Tommy is the main character
Techno was the greatest legend to ever exist and you can’t change my mind o7 techno
Rip technoblade
The look of depression that went over Tommy’s face as soon as he saw Technoblade’s house hits pretty hard. I never watched him before his passing. I hope you are doing well and my condolences are with Technoblade’s friends and family.  o7
17:48 goodbye for one last time!
Goodbye for one last time!
Ok only watch dream smp because of techno  now the king is gonw this is pointless to me to watch
Its like 6 months old and... i just saw it today,i was ctying in my mind    PS:LOVE YOUR VID AND ITS NOT MY ACCOUT RN😊
6:49 his keyboard broke up with him😢😢😢😂😂😂

Yeah i just witnessed a legacy, Tommy's success was because of the Dream SMP, those good golden days...

Tommy is the type of person to see a base and say "is anyone gonna destroy that?" And not wait for an answer
5 months ago 😢

Love from India ❤
The times😢❤❤ bye Dream SMP RIP 😭😭🫶

WHY DID YOU MAKE IT SO SEX IS OUT THERE NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Jump....

17:31, the duo stuck together till the end
Don't cry cuz it ended cry because it happened
It's hits me really hard when all those good days were there it's sad that techno's pets are still in his house I wish he could see it
rewatching this always bring me into tears... its been 4 months, but ill never forget the dsmp
It hhrts its bren 5 monthd
im not crying u are…….
Omg the ending to this vid, so much emotion, been there from the start and seen him grow, it’s awesome to see how far everyone has come…. Truly a tear worthy video    O7 Technoblade
.
Can we get an F that Techno couldn’t be here and who wish’s he was still here huh
I legit started crying when he went to Techno's house.  As soon as I saw snow on the ground I began getting emotional as I knew where we were going.  Buy Techno's merch. Technoblade never dies.
R.I.P Technoblade
Wh-why?  Also, r.i.p tecnoblade 1999-2022
If I was in the dream smp I would have burned all the gay flags
I have rewatched this video over the past few months so many times. I'll be laughing my ass off in the beginning, and when the video is ending, I would be struggling to hold back tears. Every time! The Dream smp alone was like that though. An emotional rollercoaster. One that would make you happy, one that could make you cry, one that could make you feel like you were right there next to the characters.  Even if I had joined the fandom a year after it started, I can still see how much effort and time it took to make each stream-- from all of the creators! To make the streams, the plot, the characters, heck, even the animals! Were worth watching.  And even if I can't come home from school and know that'll there will be another dsmp stream waiting for me, I'll know that it had ended, it had already delivered its purpose, it had already given so many creators a chance. And I think that... that one fact is enough to keep me happy.  Even if it ended though, I'm happy it happened. I'm happy that I got to see so many streams. I'm happy that I met so many friends through it. I'm happy even if this truly marks the end. Even if theres nothing quite like this server.   I'm happy.  Thank you Dream SMP. For everything.
I started to fuckig cry when i saw techno'  and philzas house
awhh :(
It’s sad that techno couldn’t be here to be apart of the end of the dsmp
The dsmp was a comfort through a really hard and difficult time for me that really hit my mental health and the dsmp helped to such so to see it got is really difficult  Also them killing the dragon  Ending the dsmp  Wrapping the story up  Finishing what needs to be finished It just didn’t feel right without techno  And it never will be  But they did it and it’s all over  Goodbye dsmp  We had a good one  o7
16:14... A look of a man who got his wish.
Thank god this shit is finally over
That made me cry the end of it all...
We are so grateful for everything you’ve offered to us all, guys. Thank you, truly. Goodbye for now, DSMP. 🎉
16:53 almost made me cry because of the nosaligic song thats was from 2020 ;-;
I'm late but what happened to the smp? And I loved this series that you guys inspired me to make my own smp
skill issue
I joined dreams server now he hatesme..... Goodbye dreansmp
Can you still log on for nostalgia? Like if you want to see Technoblades home again or just want to visit the server again are you allowed too?
I just wanna say Thank you for changing my life i was young watching the Dream smp, it was fun watching the streams. ♥
E
finally
2:45    Bottom text.
Nooo💔
this whole smp changed my life every time tommy was live after i got out of school i would sit and watch it to the end. i’ll never forget bench trio and all the disc wars that made me forget i was only just watching a youtube video.
HUMMINA
…
Dream smp will be always remembered it made me very sad to leave it like this but goodbye to everything
FUCKKKK MAN I JUST DRANK THAT WATER AND YOU MADE ME CRY IT OUT
We like you tommy❤😊
I cried a lot because this is the last vid😢
Thank you for making this video. I am several months late to the party, but it is greatly appreciated.
this made me cry
I like the part where tommy became a man 99:45:34
I know I'm very late, but the dsmp meant a lot to me and the thought of it ending makes me wanna cry, it has been an emotional trip and it will always be apart of our heart ❤️. Thank you and Goodbye dsmp
As I see this video late. I wonder. This is big already knowing and then seeing this video. I am actually crying. We should make a new dream smp where everyone joins at the same time and makes a new smp
I put off watching this because I knew it would make me sad. I may not have been there for the start of the Dsmp, I only started watching after the Manburg arc, but ever since I've been a huge fan. Watching these streamers lore and stories, watching them grow was so amazing and inspiring, it makes me so sad to see it end. I got to know the story of so many people, and even if it was just a game, it felt real. As much as I wish it didn't end so soon, I'm glad to have been a part of the journey. o7's to the great warriors, kings and poets of the smp, may your stories forever live on
best time ever❤❤❤❤
Ayow....I thought this is a kids content... bruh...💀
and hello nightmaresmp
How many people cried during Tommy's speech at 10:21

Badboyhalo
This made me cry
I miss 2020, best and worst year of our lifes
r.i.p techno
Who would have guessed one of the first videos I watched of the dream amp would be there last❤
It took me months to gather enough courage to watch this. I immediately burst into tears 11 minutes into the video
Jk
i cried irl
Yay m Henry
"SHROOOOUUUDDD!" Pure parental love terror
I still can’t get over the fact the dream smp has been gone for 5 months, I still can’t get over the final lore stream
This was such an emotional stream to be watching live lmaoooo—
I love how made the video at the end the first video he made on the server
Damn, if only techno didn’t die.
This made me cry, looking back at all of the videos of DSMP.  It hits hard to know it’s gone.  For good. ❤😭 It’s always gonna be there, as a server.. With nothing on the server, but memories 😭😭
5months have already passed, and i hadn't really watched a lot of Dsmp.  and despite how much i want to write a wholesome comment.. how much the dsmp really means to everyone... my stupid side just goes: "nah im too lazy"  but you know what? i really haven't been updated with Dsmp stuff but it's still been a big part of everyone's life. everyone will miss everyone and everything, every event that's happened. everything that happened in the smp, stays in the smp. everyone misses techno, and everyone else. I hope nobody will forget this video and every other video and stream of the smp. byebye dsmp
o7.
1:08 Actually me. This was my first stream I watched on twitch from dsmp lol
I nearly cried watching this 😢
I actually never thought a guy playing a block game would make me cry o7 Dsmp

“Im being touched” should have said by a black man

I finally watched the video, wasn't sure I was exactly ready. But I was there during covid ever since 2020, I have made so many friends and learned so many lessons; there have been a lot of bumps throughout everything but I wouldn't wish it different for the world. I care so much about this part of my life and it has lead to so many amazing memories. Thank you to all of those who made this server what it was <3

Dude that Techno stuff genuinely gets me so emotional oh my god my heart-  Rest in peace legend. ♥️
It's been so long, Dream SMP was such a relief,I would get home after a stressful day,and my face would lighten to ser that any of them were streaming,After all they have been through together,and we've all got to watch it,All this time has made me learn alot,Friendship is truly something so admirable,and dream SMP showed that on a almost daily basis, through people leaving,and joining, the wars, battles, and every ss of them all together will never be forgotten
R I P technoblade the ledgand
I’m coming back to this because I miss the dream Smp. I joined it ever since it started. It was so entertaining!

The ender dragon: “ohh… fu-“

Dreams voice has chanced

😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
lmaoo skill issue gay ahh smp
Noooooooooooooooo😢
The Dream SMP was the best of all time I'm sad to see it r.i.p 😢😢😢😢
Man, I didn't expect this to be an emotional rollercoaster, but I must say that the Dream SMP was my friend at the height of the pandemic. Moreover, this had become my partner in relieving stress when I was at my lowest point. Lastly, I watched this when I was in the last year of junior high school, and now I'm a college student. Thank you for everything, Dream SMP! <3
If I want to cry I skip to when he visits his house.
Noob
dear the dream smp and everyone else that is reading this. the dream smp really made me happy even when i was going through a bad time also when my dad died so i would always go on tommys or tubbos tbh the hole dream smps yt and just watch them be happy even when there were on the dream smp and it made me happy and i loved all of them<3 but now that its gone idk what to do anymore... but im still happy i got to see them happy on the last day<3 and im happy that the dream smp happened in the first place bc if not i wouldn't be this happy at all<3 thank you to all of you... i really had a good time watching all of your videos. but one thing i reall miss is all of you and the one and only Technoblade that never dies  and if it wasn't for all of you guys the viewers i wouldn't  see tommys vid or Technoblades or tubbos and the others, i wouldn't be this happy so thank you for everything yall have done for me and more people<3 love u all<33 -azalea

i miss this, technoblade and all of it who. else noticed tubbo was the first and last person tommy met in this video.
2:45 it says "bottom text" LMAO

R.I.P SMP
Without techno, it wouldn’t have worked out. Especially not without Wilbur.
Wait what, NO WHY YOU GOTTA LEAVE, the dream smp changed my life and the dream smp was the only thing I wanted to watch 😢
gimmie the sex mom
Ik this is late but tbh im not a baby but it still kinda hurts to see it go. The DSMP had a good part in my heart now its gone. It just kinda hurts.
a wise man once said "do nat be sad beacause its over be happy because it happend" -wise man
finally
Btch fcking make season 2
The best part was how tommy immediately went to check on shroud when the explosions happenes
i cried when the techno part came-
Every single part of it every single part of the dream smp  Is probably my favorite every single bit of it
Where is dream?
block gaem big surver gon
was 1 of the best tings i have ver seen realy maid me happy
rip dream smp
I wish i was in the dream smp. After techno died i wouldve streamed and live his life. Rest in peace.. the king.
Ok...I'm not actually in this kind of stuff but I just had the urge to watch it in the middle of the night ,now I'm watching it all over again
The fact that all that is over hurts. Not as much as it hurts them but I watched this and started crying
Tubbo and Tommy sitting together romanticly at the end like the married couple they are
dream smp is my gate to understanding internet society.
The fact that he went to techno’s house and found a disc… but Tommy’s face after leaving his house..we will miss techno rip..
*YESSSSSSS LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO*
I will always remember it^^.
Im ACTALLY crying i was in the fandom since it started. :.( im gonna miss it. Sm. Everyone was/is my favorite!
I'm gonna be completely honest this video made me cry.
read how to s*x what?
o7 techno and dsmp, rest easy
I've been rewatching this video and looking back on all the old memories ive made and it brings me to tears knowing this was the happiest time of my life. Thank you for everything.
Aww man thats so sad I really love it and when see anyone I 😂😂 so hard goodbye:(
Rip techno and rip Tommy from the dream smp
Rip…
Dream smp is not complete without techno

Anyone else remember techno?
The last portal transition was so smooth
What happened to DSMP? Why did it end?
Its been months since dream smp ended but i still cant move on it just feels sad and all
Tommy i hope you become a 50 million subscribers youtuber
Not everyone one talking abt the amp while Tommy’s bucket list has read  sex💀
):
It's been fun guys, watching every stream. But as they all say, "all good things must come to an end. "
i hope they make a diffrent smp
16:16 this look was awesome
Tommy watch the old vids I saw a techno disk 📀 when u moved with him in dream SMP in the room full of skulls in a chest
Ima actually crying rn
😭
Bro who else was crying 😭  👇
why did they leave dream smp its because technoblade is dead
4 months passed, DreamSMP still exists in my heart ❤
Why does dream sound like that!?!?!
Bye dream SMP 😢
I know I’m late but I used to watch the dream smp all the time and I came back to watch the final video it’s like they say  “All good things must come to an end” goodbye dream smp
9 dream 11 your SMP has been destroyed
I don't go here anymore I miss him 😢
dream should make season 2
For a second I thought tommy was gonna cry cause techno isn’t here anymore
Thank you Tommy.
when i was watching them it felt different in a good way i now i am so sad that some people even tell me i am now depressed it’s sad that the dream smp has to go now 😢
I never thought I would cry more than I have laughed in a tommyinit video, but this was just so wholesome that you can't help but cry. Technoblade never dies.
Dsmp changed my life, thank you for being there.
uoh
Good bye dream smp
I just fucking cried when I wasn’t he’d that stream.
It would have been incredibly cool if Technoblade had lived to see this.
i wish techno was there rip
Dsmp taught us more things than school
YES THE END OF THE CR- jk
first time tommy actually cried
I used to love the dsmp I left a while ago after Technoblade death.
I love the part where you visited Techno’s house. It was just so sweet and respectful
he was running too much then he turn on narrator
Did technoblade die😮😮😢😢
😢
i was like, "hbomb, thats bloons. wait does bad play bloons? or maybe he just watches hbomb. either way thats a new fact i just learned."
I know im extremley late to this but Heres my experiences  I remember being in yr8 in school, tommy had streamed the day before and i ddint get to watch it. I was a lonley kid in highschool, i had no friends. I was sat at a lunch table. My phone under the table (as we werent allowed to use our phones in school) watching the latest tommy stream. Some people came over to me and asked if i was watching the dream SMP..i said yes...these people were my first ever friends and we all loved the dream SMP..we would be on calls together watching the SMP..it even inspired us to start our own..but unfortunately that friendship soon ended and i was the lonley kid again and the dream SMP was my only friend. All the memories, laughs, cries, screams all came back to me. Watching this video made me realise that there was something to live for. Dream SMP carried me thru the years of my life where i wanted to end everything..and i cant thank them enough for it. Hearing technoblades passing broke my heart. I didnt leave my room for days. But i kept wachting his videos..watching the lore..everything. these guys were and still are my comfort.   Thank you so much for such amazing times..  Javier..over and out :)
I thought it was fake and now I am on the verge of tears 😭
no stop that was so sad
This was so emotional for me I almost cried ❤ yes I realize how extremely late I am but honestly idec bc this was so sweet and was exactly what we needed
This hurt so much. The DSMP found me when Techno passed. It helped me through all those hard times. It helped me during my lowest. And I can’t even put into words how much I’m grateful to have these videos. Thank you Tommy, for putting all of this together
noo dream smp
I am literally crying irl i love u we all support u whatever heppens tommy 😢
Why is it ending?
End of an era
i love the dream smp. i love the people i used to watch make silly videos together. i love the storylines and the lore and tales i could get lost in. i love the friendships i was there to see bloom and the connections i felt between people. i love the community and everything this server has taught me. i love how it helped me through my covid years and gave me something to look forward too when everything else was so dark. i love hearing the nostalgic voices of my favorite people welcoming me to the stream. i love rewatching old videos of technoblade and the rest of the server members. i love reading through comics and viewing others art and animations. i love how the community inspired me to create art and gave me a passion through my darkest times. i love how the dream smp has changed mine and so many other’s lives. and even though it hurts so badly to see it end, i love that it happened at all. words cannot express my gratitude towards everyone here. thank you, dream smp. <3
why did it have to end? genuine question. why don’t they just keep playing?
6:25 DANG IT, TOMMY! Sad to see it go, but... all good things must come to an end.
Ranboo is the main character what techno love live techno says is

The dream smp will forever be in my life❤and in my heart     Ik it’s not a big thing to people but it was to me so it’s very sad to see it go from the way I was so happy when I first saw it❤😭
I'm going to miss the dream smp you will never be forgotten ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This made me cry it made my dad thank you❤️
Dude I cried for techno
I'm so fucking glad I was here for dsmp. I started watching in the pogtopia war but took a break for a couple months after Techno's passing and came back like 1 month ago. I love this server and everyone on it has changed my life for the better. It may sound silly but they've helped me so much. o7

"✨✨✨jUsT KiLlEd A GogY FeLlInG GoOd✨✨✨✨✨✨✨"   -Tommy 2023
dsmp was the literal definition of greatness
4 months later... Watching the video for the 4th time, lying in my bed, tucked in. It's 23:00, the last weekend of summer break in Croatia.... Crying while i watch... Then Sat up in bed, got the DSMP playlist and wached everything again, laughed, cried... And the watched this wid again... I fell asleep in my own tears, the covers and my pillow wet... Relising that 2 years passed form the beggining...
Dsmp was my life. I am so sad that it has gone to an end, I even tried making my awn servers but that didn’t turn out well, thank you to all of the dsmp members for making me who I am today 😔
You can see him holding back his tears
why did he quit and plus is the server deleted
am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor. The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious.

I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.
TECHONOBLADE FOUND ALIVE IN ALBANIA!
I’m sad it’s over it helped me so much in so many ways R.I.P Technoblade I’m crying with all of you

P.S. Thanks for your time if anyway actually read this.
The only thing that could have made the dragon killing better, would have been Technoblade there to deal the final blow. RIP Techno   P.S. who else got a bit emotional when Tommy was in Technoblades house?

Im not crying you are
The comment section in tommys TikTok about saying goodbye to the dsmp is kind of fucked up. Litterly their acting like they have “won” world war 3. They HAVE to grow up, they’re acting SO childish rn. I know you hate the smp but ATLEAST be nice!?! I loved this smp it helped me go through difficult times and YOU should respect that. Grow up and do better.
your making me cry
Butterflies
The Dream Survival MultiPlayer will always hold a place in the hearts of those who were always watching and supporting. This was an amazing journey to spectate, and I am grateful that I could be there to watch. We have to thank the Teletubby for making our lockdown lives that much more human.
Please don't do this to me in my life goal to be in the dream SMP please don't do this I know it might be closed, please I'll do anything to play with ranboo beautiful I love generation more please I want to play with you I want to please do your friends please everybody else except me I might be a random subscriber but still you know do wootly shout-outs who can get in the dream SMP please
I got really emotional when tommy entered Techno's house. Technoblade never dies.
The Dream SMP was my childhood. BadBoyHalo, Tommy, Dream, Techno, Philza, Wilbur etc. They built my childhood and every time someone streamed, i watched it and it put a smile on my face. I can’t really describe my feelings for this. This was awesome times.  R.I.P. DSMP  You gave me my childhood. -HitBird, 31 August 2023.
Ain’t the same without techno bro I wish he could see this ☹️☹️☹️☹️
The flag 6:04 😢

Only if techno was here to see this. Even though he’s gone, he’s still in our hearts. R.I.P Techno.
16:47 touched my heart 😭 R.I.P techno
Im not crying you are-
I was too sad to comment this when it came out but it reappeared on my yt now I gotta say it. I had taken a break from yt for over a year. I came back Technos gone and I never knew he had cancer. After a couple of months, I decide to watch all his dsmp streams then the very next day I see this and the one thing that kept me entertained during covid just gone. I still miss it and wish there was a season 2. I miss seeing you all together. Just a bunch of legends on a legendary SMP.
Last time seeing dream SMP i guess....
this is really wholesome but why did it end?
It hit me so hard seeing tommy go bk to technos base we all miss him and tommy all ur videos on the dsmp were funny asf
I'll miss u I love ur vids btw im boy im not gay gorge and dream are married
Dsmp was the fandom i loved the most and now our legend techno has rest and the server has come to an end it hurts that this fandom is gonna end so many memories we will remember goodbye dream smp.....
yo tommy and chat i got minecaft now
I’m crying rn that was so sad.
wait...WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You cant do this to USSS!
FINALLY 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
O7
Just a reminder that this all started from a single manhunt video…       Thank you, not just the YouTubers but also the community that has grown together, I remember when Covid just became a thing, I asked god “can you give me something to entertain myself throughout the pandemic?” I think I have the answer, he gave me 2years worth of entertainment. Thank you, all of you.
One day, my kids will see this and I will say “good times must come to an end”
thats hurting
I wasn't ready to say goodbye so I kept on avoiding to watch the last dsmp videos. I knew that day would come but I still cried.
its been nice i will remember this fandom its a part of me
seeing technos house rlly hit me, like fuck, that one hurt
Dream SMP made me happy every time I watched it, just like Techno always did, as Tommy always does
Man.. I remember when I saw that Dream, George, and Sapnap had made a server and had no idea what it'd eventually grow to be. It's been such a wild ride and I'm so sad it has to end
Already 4 months without dream smp? Damn...
I cried when I saw technos stuff still there
I’m crying so much right now I am so SAD
brought a tear to my eye (my room was underwater after this vid)
i remember the first episodes when tommy and tubbo and sapnap had war whit dream in 2020 , i started looking at dsmp when i was like 13 or something and now i'm 16.
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES❤❤ Low-key Tommyinnit is sad and emotional
We are gonna miss everything that happened in this smp, TECHNOBLADE, destroying the government,and many more😭👍🏻
twinkle twinkle little star, i will hit u with some bars
Im so sad that the blade did not go to the end😢😢😢
Miss this
It's sad that Techno didn't kill the dragon with the others ones....
1:08 I WROTE THAT EVEN IF I COMMENT ON THIS VIDEO LATE
"It was never meant to be"                                       -Wilbur That sentence refered to the server not just lmanburg, and I think wilbur did one of the coolest thing in the server by blowing up the country and while Technoblade was busy in bloody business. Tommy be like this guy(me) is a fu*king idiot not talking about me but others XD.
I grew up with Dsmp Now i feel Pain After The dsmp going.
Will there be another??
If Technoblade was still here, he would kill the entire SMP for fun
The weak laugh Tommy made at technos house got me crying.
Gods dam emotional, picture perfect ending.   Maybe it was meant to be after all.
Long live the dream smp
Crying 😭
Goodbye I loved the world😢
Such a huge part of my time during lockdown, I'm so happy to have had such an awesome time watching the Dream SMP and it helped through a lot of rough times. Thank you to all you guys, Dream, Tommy, Tubbo, Phil, Techno, Wilbur, Nikki, Fundy, George, all of you guys. Nothing but love man. Long live Technoblade!
this is sad to see it go my kid grew up on this i grew to like it good bye now
Why did i cry the entire time watching this😭
Wen real men cried😢
This video was so goddamn emotional to watch.
Just want to technoblade had seen it
you guys made my last few years in primary school memorable, Thank you so much ❤
The Dream SMP inspired me to make my own SMP and when techno died that hit me hard and not all of this I now over, who knows maybe they might go back but this SMP will always live forever. Goodbye for know Dream SMP for you will forever live in our hearts
Here since the beginning until the end. Loved all of the steams and videos on the smp. All the best Tommy. :)
This series was amazing and it was sad to see it end 😭
I was watching the videos of the dream smp to me its a big think in my life and it was good
this made me emotional
Tommy’s favorite memory is technoblade
Best memories, best clips and best friends all coming together to take down minecrafts boss. It hurts me to see it go but we just gotta remember it had to end at some point. I had the same happen to me except i lost all my friends after that. Goodbye to the happiest times of my life, goodbye to maybe the happiest time of your life, goodbye to the dream SMP and one last goodbye to techno may rest in are hearts for eternity.😢❤❤❤
Technoblade is a part of every dream smp fan and he will be missed my all people around the globe
Technoblades sword and cap on the left side of the thumbnail
I will the dream smp and rip techno
This made me cry at the end 😅 and I hope there’s a dream SMP 2
Why did it end.
Its the final count down
Me being a person who barely cries, this video made me break down i don't know why but the dream smp made me go through lockdown, school and more with a smile. I just can't believe it's already ended...
I have to stop rewatching this video man. Tears streaming down my face EVERYTIME. Genuinely thank you tommy, you changed my life and got me into streaming.
I may be late when I saw this video but, even though I left the fandom at least 2 or 1 year ago and missed lots of lore or dramas, It still hurts to see that the Dream SMP are coming to an end.
Why did he quit the server
Please make a dream smp 2
.... why is tommy so evil HE LITERALLY SAID TO DREAM THAT IF TOMMY WAS DREAM HE WOULDN'T HAVE FACE REVEALED HAHAHAHA😂
He didn't listen to the music disks tho
Nothing last forever
:(
Wait wait what is Tommy in it does one rash cream like the big flashing of the Stampede try to survive 100 days Indy dream SMP😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
11:58 im not crying you are😢
What about wilbur
So sad isn't it hey? Just sad My and my best friend love talking about the dream smp when i talked Katie i was crying wilbur was my favourite.
Omg my heart 😭❤️
Dream smp help me go through my sad days and through boring covid days I will never forget them they're the best and its just sad that it will be they're last vid I'm crying while making this comment love you guyss
I hope they make a new one, WITH MODS!
Somehow it was fitting that it was turbo who killed the dragon
Noooooo 😢 I miss it sooo much
No4
No3
No2
No
I just keep coming back to these videos. It's still kind of unbelievable that it's ended. I just keep realizing how much I miss this server and the people in it.
10:28 What the fuck kind of power does Mice on Venus hold??? What kind of magic beams of sadness does it PIERCE my HEART WITH????
:(
Watching this, I cried and I can proundly say:" I WAS FUCKING THERE!" Man I really wish I would go and stay there irl, the dream amp really changed me, this server saw my coming out, gender crisis and gender reveal, met incredible people, an incredible fandom who fought for freedom from the haters, people and characters that lost their canon life.  The dream smp will always stay in my heart, like a home with warm hugs (and free traumas from the green boy)  My final thing for the dream smp is: Thank you for everything<3 (I'm crying rn)
o7 Dsmp❤
Brrrrrooooo😭😭        i can't     not  stop cry
The Last Stream of dream smp Will be Remembered❤ rip TechnoBlade❤

🥺😭
Ive watched this video more then 10 times and it still brings me to tears
im genuinly crying, this changed my life for the better. it has comforted me when i was down and i made me laugh when i was down.
Goodbye Dream SMP😢

Dream Smp gonna be nostalgic in the future.
Tommy: "-There will always be the world download-" Me:... Explain? ... TELL ME HOW
I literally cried when i saw shroud
9:00 is sooo funy lol!
Not main character in dream SMP and dream is the creator bish
Man this has been so sad, i never new that they shut the SMP down till 3 months later. i remember all those years during covid and how much i loved the dream SMP, all the fun things from dream, technoblade, badboyhalo, george, sapnap, tommy, quackity, wilbur and all the other SMP members.  the thing is since Techno left, things have not been the same, i still remember the manhunts of dream which were my favorite and especially Sapnap bein my most favorite hunter. thank you dream for all that entertainment from 2020 to 2023
17:48 it went back to the first video when he first joined the smp
16:40 "What's your favorite bit?" Hit hard man.
I demand some sort of a second season or smth, like a TommySMP, we have to keep this goin
when I was grade 1 I always watch dream smp now it ending when I see  Tecno house I cry
guys u know why he wanna its over heheh   he said at 15m sub  he has to pay 50k to charity  i think
Please don't ever close this server..!!! Please always go back once a year and Remember the great technoblade!!
It’s sad that all of that the dream smp came to a close legends were made RIP Techno Blade
WHY DID IT SAY READ HOW TO SEX😨
FINALLY
Good memories its gonna be hard to forgot that also somthing funny the house look like the teletoobie one
🖕 why the fuck is DreamSMP so important
it hurts to see it come to a end, after so long, but sadly, all good things come to a end
I’m crying rn
damn.. this sh made my days at 2020
That was a journey.
o7
Omg I almost cried 😢
I actually feel like crying rn,alk ur happy memories...😢
It’s hits me hard that this is the end of it maybe just maybe in a different universe things would of lasted
I cried the dreamsmp was the best even though i have leave the fandom i still watch some vids ❤️
Dear Tommyinnit i loved watching dsmp vids most of the time i had a chance to watch it, It was my fav part of the day,Thank you for being a big part of my life Tommyinnit i will always miss the dsmp thank you and bye...........:]
god, i was already kinda teary at the thought of saying goodbye to everything. Then he went to technos house. I lost it. Just the fact that he wasn't here to help them beat the ender dragon, to see the smp come to and end.... fuck its just not fair. I miss him. He made some of the SMP lore moments the coolest most interesting times of my covid years. Gave me something to actually look forward to... Rest in Peace Techno. <3
I’m late but can we get a chain of o7 for the dsmp chapter in our lives coming to a close and for the king himself that shall never die. Thank you to everyone in the smp that gave us memories that we shall never forget and let it be something we can tell future gamers about with pride.
even though i left the fandom a while a go, this hits deep. its sad to see this end. it was apart of my childhood, apart of me. but, all great things must come to an end. o7
The end of an era. We all laughed and cried together in some of the best moments of this server, but along the way we all grew even us as viewers everything is different now, but we have the memories. O7 DSMP we will all miss you and the stories you told thank you for teaching us who we are and much love to everyone who helped us get there.
I’m just crying
Im sad that they didnt use the portal that was in the syndicate base
Tubbo kinda...   TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!
I'm sad man techno never got to see the end of all this and it's also sad to see it go
What's the song TommyInnit used during the EnderDragon Fight? He uses it in a lot of videos but I can't find it.
STOP IM GONNA CRY 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭*(INTENSE SOBBING)*
I cried when I watched this
2:08 your profile is LITERALLY you crying
Its so sad that techno is gone but his pets are sitting waiting for him to cone back 😭😭😭😭😭
Nooooooooooooo!!!😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
i cried watching this video
im finna cry bro
Dream SMP is possibly the cringiest part of my life, yet I was happiest at the time, It really means to me and seeing this video makes me feel a really bittersweet feeling
"How to sex" 💀💀💀
Theres no such thing as perfect bromanc- tommy and tubbo🥲
rest in peace, techno. I was never really what you would consider a ‘fan’ but I watched a few videos. very entertaining (not just of techno’s, ive watched tommy, dream, george, sap, and many others) although i did get out of the phase a year or two ago, i just want to say thank you. holy shit im late.
I wish techno was here
this server will always be remembered... goodbye dsmp
"I've never cried on Stream" *also Tommy crying in his Techno video* (I did to)
seriously emotional 🥹
This is the reason why I don't like 2023
good joke bro
That's so true and so sad 😭 RIP Technoblade
hey Dream SMP was the reason i've learned english,the experience of watching DSMP when you had online lessons during covid was the best
Boutta cry
o7
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
cant help but feel techno should have been there, great final thing tho'
I'm not crying you are TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES o7 fly high king 🕊️
Tommy's best quote: ✨ shoot the woman in the sky✨, ✨ just killed a gogy feelin gud✨   This is the best episode and the memories of the server is wholesome  Well except for the swearing XD
Wait what no way dude why☠️☠️☠️☠️
R.I.P Dream SMP
Dream SMP Bye-bye😢 16:31
8:13 why’s dreams voice so deep lol.
but why you  gotta leave
Lets cheer up. "Read how to sex"?
Bro this dude is so annoying yeah tommy  YOU RUINED the dream smp
Dear Tom.   Even tho I’m watching this 3mo later i still cry. the day techno died I was all ready sad enough,but when I heard the smp was going to get deleted it raised my depression   Ps. Hopefully everyone is doing good with out the smp.
this video genuinely maid me cry😭 and just so you know i dont cry that much when it comes to videos and that show how hard it hit me to see this
technoblade claims: "NOT EVEN CLOSE BABY! TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!" Stage 4 cancer:
Imagine the server went public when they all left it.
All the videos but are you quiting or you   getting kicked if not you should use the smp to hang out with your friends think of all the things you have done think all the time think about everyone just have a good time 🥹
did you get your disks
The fact Tommy put the same Celeste soundtrack over the end of this that Schlatt did when he ended SMPLive is really something. I love that. And seeing Techno's house was insanely emotional. Technoblade Never Dies
Dream sounds different
Ive been avoiding this video for so long.. now that ive finally watched it, i cant stop crying dude..
I can't believe it's over
If only Techno was there. He would have blown up the End island if he could
Man this is sad for me cus I rember dream tecnoblade now the smp they created is now gone😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭☹️☹️☹️☹️😭😭😭😭😭
Goodbye tecnho Goodbye dream SMP or should say SMP innit
7:22 bro turned into every high school girl
This was hard for me to watch, I remember watching the complications and funny moments and this server just meant a lot to me, and it's sad to see it go, but oh well. One of the only times I wish I could go back to 2020
Don't be sad cuz its over, be happy cuz it happend. i am crying right now its just so wrong to think this is over that too without techno.
wish that... that. techno could have been for the finally... I miss him so much...
Finally
no
Im still rewatching their videos to make me happy
This video made me so sad, to see that they are leaving the dreamSMP, i wasnt there when they first made these videos.... but later on i got to know them better, its hard for me to see them have to leave but its all part of life. LOVE YOU ALL DREAMSMP!!!!
Dream SMP changed my life because it helped everyone become simps for Dream…
R u ok😢
May the smp rest with the legends that made it
how dare you
Im just now seeong this video and honestly im sad,i stipped watchi g right after trchnos death but I was apart of tommys first ever stream on this server and i regret not being there for his last ever.  I watched tommy so much during this time and i had around 100k points just in like 1 month of his streams on twitch. Thank you tommy because even tho i stipped watching, this is apart of my life.  Also tommys the main character ive also believed this
FUCK IM CRYING NOW GOD DMNIT
This isn’t my YouTube account but I grew up on dream amo and this was so sad bro
Even though i stoped really been watching dream smp vids about 2 years ago it still really hits me harder then 10000 semi trucks
Nooo please don't leave it would mean so much to techno if you stayed
I can’t stop crying man
thank god
Man, I left the fandom for a while and found this, Dream SMP was fun to watch and see other content creators watch it, although the greatest one, Techno died,  it was still fun to watch a few videos here and there. But now, it’s died for a while. Thank you dream, creating the server, and tommy to make us laugh.  As always, fly high techno.
I didn't watch this stream since I didn't want to cry, but I pressured myself to anyway. Pog.  I first watched the Dream SMP a couple of months before my 12th birthday. I didn't understand anyone really, but a few members caught my eye. Wilbur, Tommy, Tubbo, Techno, Phil, Dream, Bad, Skeppy, Quackity and a few more that I unfortunately can't remember. I remember just being so entertained and thrilled when I saw someone was live. It made me so happy and made me smile at my lowest. It also introduced me to my favourite band, Lovejoy. I've been told many negative things about the Dream SMP by people, but I don't care. The Dream SMP was and always will be like a second home to me. Technoblade, too. I remember the day my best friend told me, and I just rushed to his channel praying it wasn't true. I will always remember the little "HEH??" he did. o7. I'm turning 13 in a couple of weeks now.   Thank you, Dream SMP. Thank you for making my life so much better. 💜
I've watched so long it's sad. It comes to a end   Past lives never gonna bring me down
Read How To Se#
For some reason Tubbo killing the ender dragon was the best part of this for me lol
I'm sobbing rn but its happy tears :')
You could see Tommy was about to cry when he was in technos house
😭😭😭😭😭I miss techno Blade 🐷👑
I miss the dream smp as much as I miss Technoblade seeing his base again made me cry so much 😢❤❤Technoblade never dies
tommy this isn't my first time watching the vid but you said that the world download will allways be there.... where is it 😢?
Thank fucking god.

I think its really nice that he spent his moments with tubbo, his best friend.
lets go its finally over

Man the editing on this video is fucking amazing  almost cried ngl
“Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened”                                                                      - A wise man

Time truly files when we see things end in a blink of an eye. I’ve been watching dream smp and it was such a great memory. Thank you all for making this amazing memory.
I teared up seeing Technos house
I’m waiting for dream SMP two.
This needs to be Tommy’s saddest tweet vid🥹
Why
this is actually so sad im going to cry
Man, when you watch Tommy go through everything and then see him disconnect for the last time, it hits different.
Drean smp was the best.
dont cry because its over smile because it happened 😭
To see Tommy tear up at Techno's place made me cry, Rest in piece Potato warrior.
☭️
16:14 That glance from Tommy made me cry a bit 😢
he is against dream..... so now i will just comment i hate him. Meanwhile he didnt have to tell us the second  thing down you know thats a little for yourself so yeah thats my comment and i hate this >:/
I'm balling my eyes rn
Wait a damn minute... cut the camara dead ass ...  SO NO MORE PRIME NO MORE POGGERS NO MORE... M L G CLUTCHHHHH? it's been a good adventure with you all-rip dream s-m-p....
2:45 *bottom text*
Ive been scared to watch this video ive stopped watching when techno was dead when i saw this this made it worst i remember  in 2020 i watched the first dream smp video i saw tommy and dream arguing  never thought  this day would come thank you DSMP for making me smile when i was in my lowest point its funny I thought  I could join this server.....
I wish Technoblade was there for the finale. ❤️
2:45 bottom text
The techno blade part got me crying
Dream is trash
yessss just get of it
even though i left a year and a bit ago, you just feel something about it uknow
Unfortunately, I only got into the SMP for a brief period of time, just before it ended for good- yet it still weighs on my heart to see it go. I’m still exploring all that’s happened, learning the lore- and I’ll continue to do so for as long as I possibly can. The DSMP was an amazing thing, and though I’m sad it has ended, I’m glad it began. It changed so many lives, brought so many people together- made the world just a bit more worthwhile. This was the only way to truly see it go, and it will continue to live in our hearts, a little thing, yet so big and beautiful.  “Thank you for everything.”
Still sad
..:(
The dream SMP, one SMP that changed the world. With "the best Minecrafter" We will all miss. I hope later in years Other people will make another SMP that will change the world. It will be popular like this one. But we just need to take in the memories that happened on this one.
Goodbye dream SMP 😢😢😢😢😢 Goodbye
Tubbo
Long time no ponk
GoodBye Tommyy
RainBow
The dream smp ended without Techno or Manatreed coming back..
Tommy looks depressed in 16:40
I’ll miss techno but also TECHNO BLADE NEVER DIES
im gonna miss dream smp so much😭
Dream smp changed my Iife and technobIade never dies . And its hard to see dream smp end
Wow to be honest I am sad to see it go I really enjoyed the earlier streams and the lore streams I never thought this will end but here I have seen high highs and low lows. Thank you for parts of my childhood.
YESSS
dream sounds goofy
This made me cry It can make anyone cry. Even a grown man. Seeing Tommy leave makes me so in tears.
I was there when it started, but i fell out of the fandom for about 2 years. Now im back since like a year ago, and its sad to see it all end. It was a good journey, but all good things come to an end. Thanks to the DSMP for all these years. o7
There’s only one thing I’ll ever believe in and that’s that words cut deeper that any blade and can heal you faster than any medicine because well hell it’s true isn’t it I mean technoblades dead made like 50 million people cry and we’ll it goes to show people care more about creators health than content and I know technoblades still up somewhere in the sky with his crown and cape and damn well you know he’s got the bell watching over us as we remember his legacy for ever  Technoblade never dies.
he was making him self laugh so he wouldn't cry when he was at technoblade's house
this made cry and its been a wonderfull all the series of dream smp is gonna stay in my heart for ever to i die........
I stopped watching the dsmp about a year ago and I have not watched anything dsmp or mcyt related but the messages, and what Tommy said about the server, was very heartbreaking, and even though I am not apart of the fandom or a fan of many mcyts rn, the dsmp will always feel like home to me.
bruh, i left the fandom 2 years ago, and i miss it sm.
letts goo
Dude I'm fucking crying God damnit I miss this
you can here the pain in his voice
this hit me in the feels
Im late because i don't know hoe to respond to this video but    Will miss the memories rip dsmp
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO!!!! FINALLY!!!! THE DREAMSMP IS DEAD!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
RIP Dream SMP
Goodbye dreamsmp. 🖕😃🖕
At 2:45 it says bottom text 😂
dude the technoblade part had me in TEARS. RIP king
The dream smp was made at the same month and day I was born (4th/April/2010)
Well done, Tommy, Dream, Tubbo, Techno, Bad, and all the other players I didn't mention. You successfully hooked me into something unforgettable, and I was crying for lots of chunks of this video. I'm so so sad to see you all go, but I guess it was time. Thank you for all the amazing memories.
2years of watching dream smp I'm in tears while commenting this
Why just why did it end up like this first sadly techno's passing then this noooo
The techno part made me cry 🕊🕊🕊
the dream smp will live on in our hearts
i am about to cry
one last farewell goodbye tommysmp.
I have never cried so much during a vidro
One day we’ll look back, and see how the Dream SMP effected our lives. Friendships and betrayals, love and heartbreak, joy and pain, all the characters we’ve seen along the way, and not to mention the humor. It’s sad that it’s over, but it will always live on…………..in our fanart and fanfic…………..okay, in our hearts as well, but you get the idea. Goodbye, Dream SMP :’)
Technoblade took a lot of my life and gave me a lot of happiness, the problem was when he left... did I know what to do?
Season 1 is done now season 2 begins!
Goodbye, Dream SMP.
Dont be sad because it ends, be happy it happened
Tommy the end technoblade never dies sad for goodbye up 😞

I love how the recommended video at the end of this video is Tommy's first time on the server 😂🤣😭😭😂😭

"Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened" -Dr Seuss
Out bitched once again, by the king — Tommyinnit 2020
Everyone just neglects the giant mansion Techno built before he died that got barely any screen time
Dang, that’s good news, it sucked.
This is when Tommy needs to release that he has to join QSMP
Thanks Dream SMP, Good Bye.
I instantly started crying when i saw technos house, he was the reason i laughed and woke up, he was truly a king and will always be one forever.
No more vids?
Did he leave this channel?
At the end I just sat there staring down at my phone these streams and videos helped me get through my depression most people are like it’s just a few YouTubers making videos but it was more than that it was a community or a group of people talking to their chats fighting wars and doing other stuff that made me laugh it’s so sad that it’s over thank you Tommy or anyone else from the dream smp if your reading this because without you I would’ve killed my self last year
Where is the world download?
nooooooo man
I LAUGH ALOT UNTIL you come to his place... he like a soul of the server  my god FUCK CANCER

If techno was there, this series would never be end😢. Just heart breaking moment in this video.
As bad as it may sound, Nothing lasts forever. Dream SMP was honestly my favorite since I had first heard about it.
Ive been holding off on watching videos like this because I knew I'd cry, thank you dream smp for absolutely everything <3
LETS GO THE END OF THIS GARBAGE

Im so sad dream smp this is the last time I see dream smp I looked on every video of dream smp and I really miss it so much so please make dream smp come back😢
got me sobbing ;-;
I’ve been watching since the first lmanburg war, and I’ll say that seeing this channel grow into what it has become and the growth of every member of this server is surreal. Sad that it’s ending, but glad that it happened.
I haven’t been into DSMP for a good year now, but I still laughed so many times watching this 😂
i cried so much during this vidd

O7
For two years this is the happiest place I have ever been and it's kind of sad to see go 😔 and I was technoblade died well this server was a good place to just watch Hangout man I'm going to miss his place it was nice to see it grow and all the buildings and  everyone build it's really hard to let this go but some  good things they need to come to end but that's okay it was good while it lasted it's a good thing to watch to just relax for once because some people don't get to relax all the time because some people doesn't get a break but this been here for 2 years but sometimes you got to let it go but anyways be in your heart. :D
Well dream SMP was always a part of everyone also technoblade which was a big piece of everyone here's a good place to watch and be happy has been here for like 2 years and it has changed a lot of people's life it is sad to see it go will also before I go rip technoblade 🐷🕊️
I spend 3 years on my life of this, i really can’t believe it’s finally over
Well goodbye dsmp alot of memories watching it it's the end :,) Tommy have a good life make sure you are safe farewell everyone have a good life goodbye I'm now crying so goodbye everyone :D
Dream smp wouldn't end like this if tecno didn't die
Finally
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I LOVED THE DREAM SMP VIDEOSSSS😭😭😭
Dang im super late but my tears are right on time😢
your welcome tommy and thank you for all the great laughs and i have to say you are the funniest
Remember when this video was called ”The last dream smp video” and had a diffrent thumbnail?
It’s 3 months later and I never knew this happened 😭 Almost cried three times lol
bRo the SMP was there or a bit of my life now its sad I stil Hope they make videos in the future
Finally
sHot ThE WOMeN iN THE sKY
This kinda sad but sweet…..
The thumbnail hits hard😢
i love it, Rest in peace DreamSMP
Two and a half years is my favorite one all the time goodbye dream smp
I am late to joining the fandom and I am just now really getting into it and I thought that the dream smp was still going……I was wrong…. You, tubbo,ranboo, dream, George, bbh, skeppy, sapnap, Karl, and everyone are the ones keeping me afloat through this patch that seems impossible to get through when I’m not thinking about you. I don’t mean to vent but I love you guys sm I thought I could write this without crying.  Dreams unface reveal was so sad I wanted to scream at the haters.   Techno never dies and we know that. He will live on.   I wish I could have found you guys before things got this bad but I’m glad that I found you anyway…  I love you SM and if your ever sad just know you have so many people who love you! bye Tommy ❤❤❤❤
The part where Tommy bans everyone and then becomes baffled when he gets banned also got me fucking wheezing
We will miss you smp the memories we all had with you will never forget you your amazing dream smp
its just so sad that techno wasnt there
goodbye my favorite stream of probably my whole life
This server will go down in our hearts as the best, it's truly hard to picture Tecno not being he for this special moment. "Legends never die..."
In the years the dream SMP was up it was the best time of watching these steams video and everything else about the Dream SMP very sad that it ended
Why did it end?
I’m crying 😭
Techno never got to see the end of it, but I know he was watching wherever he was thinking how amazing those few years were💖
This guy knows showmanship
This was so sad to watch
12:45 I died
Goodbye dsmp, a new smp is here with people from around the world, welcome qsmp
The way the music hit in the end 😥😊
Anyone else almost start crying when he was talking about this was his last time logging on? It hurts me to see it end bc these people helped me get through so much and now it’s over
Yay Nightmare SMP is coming soon
Dream SMP haven´t really been the same since thecnoblade died.
there might have been some highs and lows but in the end of the day we will remember this moments forever
It’s cool and all but they forgot maybe the most important person in the dsmp story, the one who brought politics to the game, the funniest out of them all. Jschlatt.
wait why is he leavin
tommy made me cry
Bye bye dream smp IM REALLY LIKE DREAM SIMP BRO so bye bye dream and  Quackity   and Tommy and all

The way i started sobbing when tommy visited technos base
Man, I'm gonna start crying any moment now from the (final) bench scene with Tubbo...
Lets just appreciate all the work he put into the thumbnail
Techno died but the last memories of him are gone😢
it is not same without techno
It’s really sad  to see it go but can we just take a moment to look back on what this man said 1:36  this had me dying
It hits hard seeing Dream SMP going, it changed my life and helped me through so much, it will be greatly missed, Farwell Dream SMP. o7
the DSMP fucking changed me. i remember my face lighting up everytime a twitch notification went off saying "___ went live". all my usernames were only "dsmp_FANN09", "ranbooistall", "ilovetommyinnit9873", and "SLIMECICLE". fuck, ill miss lmanburg, ill miss pogtopia, ill miss henry, ill miss shroud, ill miss the cursed ass hotel, ill miss bee boy, ill miss the giant enderman, ill miss dream, ill miss gogy, ill miss the 100 wars, ill miss hbomb, ill miss sam, ill miss bbh, ill miss skeppy, ill miss tom, ill miss ponk, ill miss punz, ill miss puffy, ill miss hannah, ill miss phil, ill miss the dsmp, and ill miss techno. i remember the first stream tommy had done on the smp. i remember ranboo's eye rev, everything. i miss this huge fucking part of my life. jesus, what a community. and tom, i never missed a stream. o7.  for the last time, goodbye dsmp. it hurts that i cant say "see you tommorow" after. ❤
I'm crying rn cos I've been there since the beginning and it's so hard still watching the old streams and they have techno in 😢😢😢
I love your vids tommy I been a fan since 12 years old im now turning 16 I will support you forever from Ericka Anne Oda I'm just using  my dad's acc
Hello Tommy, this is a boy named Alfie. Probably your biggest fan but I’m sure you have many of them. These smp videos have gotten me through the pandemic, mild depression, thoughts of 🔫 myself and basically my life. Techno is an inspiration.. YOU ARE AN INSPIRATION! You have made me cry and laugh. I really hope this isn’t your last time on this historic server.  Well done Tommy. Sincerely, Alfie. 🙂
The greatest mlg
Tommy always changes his video titles
I was crying the whole time that Tommy was at Technobpades😢❤
you know if it werent for the dream smp i would never have become the more better person i am today these people were there even when no one is you can always rely on tommy to make you laugh lean on ranboo to rant eat sand and sing songs with wilbur no matter how weird it gets, you can always come to tubbo for comfort, niki for hugs, and for techno to rest and remember, they will always be here, they're home to me and you and to all that have been here
Good bye to dream smp will allways remember u😭😭
o7 for Dream SMP and more importantly Technoblade. ''Technoblade Never Dies'' ''Dream SMP Never Dies''
Technoblade never dies
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  SO UR NEVER GONNA MAKE ANOTHER VIDEO? IM LITERALLY GONNA CRY
imagine drista was there
I genuinely started crying when I saw technos house. R.I.P. an absolute legend. I remember the day he died and how long I cried. He was my favorite streamer/YouTuber. R.I.P. Techno, you will be missed o7
I can't believe it! It's actually the end of it this entired dream smp was surely gonna miss and techno that all his pets gonna sit there for century tho😢 dsmp make big changing since lot member of smp and gang their all look happier and grateful, i really to missed them so much, dsmp and even included tinakitten is next girl where she belong to step in forward❤
i grewed up  watching dreamsmps series but now seeing it end i was crying i wont forget of all the memorys of the dreamsmps i wont forget anyone and technoblade but rip technoblade and dreamsmp
Sobbing crying throwing up. I put this video off this video for three months because I wasn’t ready to accept/let go of the DSMP ending. The DSMP was such a huge part of my life in more ways the one. I met amazing people and got to view amazing things from amazing creators. This place helped me through some of the darkest places in my life and i don’t know where I’d be if I hadn’t had it around me when I did. I’ll miss it for sure, but I just think it opened the creators so many new possibilities for themselves and for the people who watch/watched their content. It’s a new chapter for everyone, and all we can do is move forward with it. But that doesn’t mean the memories will ever fade. Thank you for giving me what felt like a comfort space and for others too. That’s all I have left to say. RIP Techno o7
Why did they have to leave
11:47 :(
Tommy visiting Technoblade's home and the bell in Dream SMP made me tear up, man I really miss Techno
The smp will never be gone and neither will technoblade he went to fight god and when he wins he will return for his friends, his home, his family, and his pets. Plus i know you all saw his Armor, well i can promise that he will wear it again.
pog
His dad came back now!
It made me cry about this dream smp I watch his whole smp video it was so fun to watch and now it is gonna be end which made me cry 😢😢😢😢😢rest in peace technoblade and dream smp
If this server gets to the public im going to every single place mostly technos house tho
Tell dream dream smp is so good but it's sad that technoblade is not there in this world but my humble request is don't stop dream smp make content in it again
Bruh. Why my eyes are wet. Can't deny bro
This is so sad first techno died and now Tommy's leaving the dream smp
Im gonna cry😢
This video was just a beautiful emotional rollercoaster for me thank you tommy and everyone on the dream smp. ❤
LETS GO
I know that the real ending was with the lore but honestly I think this video should be the end
damn
Im a bit late to this, but dream smp has been a big part of my childhood, and it's so sad that it has ended. I'm legit crying whilst writing this. I remember the day I found Tommy on my YouTube recommended when I was 10 years old lol,  and from there I found everyone else from the dream smp. 4 years later and I'm still watching.
10:55 o7 R.I.P
:D YAY
I’m not crying you’re crying
This reminds me of the last day of school, where all of the memories just come back to you. Even if the year sucked,  you still miss it.
Hill house. Just watched a three year old stream one of the first maybe the first. Hill house.
So much memories and RIP technoblade  Blod for the blod god and technoblades never dies
“Thank you for everything” -tommyinnit 2023
It was great watching this series, and sad to see it go but it’s great to see a final video
just me or does dream sound different?
It was hard to watch this without technoblade
If technoblade was in there fighting the dragon it wil be fun  Rest in peace king techno😢 Ty dream,tommy and other for doing the dsmp 😢 so long 😢
Technoblade will be in our heart forever
I was never apart of the dream smp fandom. But this still hits hard. The impact that the Dream Smp had on everyone fan or not was huge. I rewatched this 4 Times because I didn't want to  say goodbye. I just can't wrap my head around it. No more streams, no more memories, no more dream smp. I just don't want to let go. Goodbye Dream SMP 💗🐷👑💎🗡
🤓
Goddamn dude, I grew up watching this and now it’s done, through the two years I felt like I could escape reality when I watched. So thank you for everything Tommy, and keep being a bitch to bad boy halo😂
Those 2 years of the Dream SMP were the best 2 years of my life. I’m so sad to see it gone, but glad it happened to my life. If i could go back in time and rewatch all of these streams when they happened, i would.  Rest in Peace, Technoblade and Goodbye, Dream SMP
Even this 3 months ago, I still cry to this video
Dream SMP is the best smp of the decade.
Where is ranboo?
Im not crying your crying
I'm a little late. Mainly because I've been passing this off as just another video and refusing to watch it. But I'm so grateful I finally did. This video caused more tears then any of the Lore streams ever did. Covid was a tough time for us all, but thanks to Dream, George, Tommy, Bad, Skeepy, Ponk, Hannah, Callahan, Alyssa, Punz, Tubbo, Niki, Wilbur, Phil, and everyone else including the most important of them all- Technoblade. They all made those tough times a million times better. This SMP started when I was in grade 8 and I soon start grade 12. It's fucking insane. This SMP, these people, have been the biggest part of my life for what feels like decades. I grew up with them, matured with them, we all had our ups and downs. But you know what? Even through everything, this server was still there. It's so sad to say our final goodbyes. But you know what? Who fucking cares. Because this server gave us all more life then anything else ever could. And we will always be forever greatful. Isn't that right chat?     Ps. Rest in peace Technoblade. 💙
Tommy laughing to ignore the sorrow: Me just straight up tearing up:
Good bye 😢
Its really sad that techno isnt on  that bench with them at least his spirit May slay the god he wishes to defeat❤🐷👑
Cry :(
Noooo not you too Tommy :(
all that time and dream still never made a house
im gonna miss it soo much
What a legendary Journey
16:15 the way tommy looks at the camera... i can tell his glad everything happened
What I would give to re-watch it all again, live. What I would give.
Dream smp was my childhood its so sad to see it go goodbye dream smp. Rip techno
When he eat the mic, it was the funnies thing in the video!!!
It kinda hit hard when Tommy visited Technoblades house… all his animals and items still left exactly where he last left them.  Tommy and everyone on the SMP finally defeating the ender dragon, (in their normal chaotic way) and then watching their last sunset on the Dream SMP as they listened to the disks that had brought so many together… and in that final moment as the sun went down…it was over. The SMP was done.   Don’t be sad because it’s over, smile because it happened.
I remember when I was watching Tommy when he only had 1 million subs man
Wait why did he leave again ?
"Just killed a gogy, feelin' good!"
love it :) 😍
Right after this the first every tommy dream video showed up
''...It was never meant to be...'' A quote by a traitor, and a quote by a corrupt friend.
All good things come to an end
rest in peace techno rest in peace dream smp you both will stay in our hearts
Noooooooooooooooo 😢😢😢😢😢
Technoblade has made the achievement [The End]
"Read how to sex" 💀
Me skipping forward: Dream: "I don't remember spawn being so *_gay_* "
the end of an era
But what happened to dream’s voice? (And respect that techno’s house is still there🫡)
Techno blade never dies!❤
o7, good bye
Goodbye Bad SMP!
WHY!!!!???? SEX IS OUT THERE
probbably one of the saddest videos in youtube and technos death made it sadder
Who feels like our childhood thing to watch is gone now😢
I was on the server,on the 1seson I was the villian and on the 2seson I was a I was the founder of the kingdom and I was the last person who played on server for like 2months....well the Admin shot down the serwer... when the president came up with the idea of ending the sewer, I was the only one... who walked in at the time
“Don’t be sad it’s over, be glad it happened.”
Tommy:I'm the main character Ranboo:I think that you don't know something
Whats the music at 11:41 and 16:15?
im late, but DSMP meant a lot to me and genuinely changed me as a person. it's bittersweet to see one last video in the server.
Goddamnit, dude. The video ended and it autoplayed to Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up". Thanks, YouTube.
If u put 2017 tommy with 2023 tommy, he hasn’t changed that much,but if u put 2017 tubo with 2023 tubbo,There is just an immense character development on him that make u say:”Ye,... that’s me tubbo all right,not a pawn anymore,but a king in SnowChester.😶🐝🐝he’s no longer tubo,he’s now Tubo.
Man, I wish they had never ended the Dream SMP.
Every comment is the same :skull:
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢m😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I wasn’t expecting to cry today. I was fine until the ending. so-called “rivals”become friends. I literally had to keep telling myself “ this is a new chapter of everyone’s life and their content is going to get better. heck I’m even crying while writing this. to everyone who sees this comment. remember all of the fun memories we had. but there’s a new SMP coming around that will never replace this one, but maybe can replace our grief. Quackity’s server. It may have not everyone that were in the original, but it’s enough until we watch this video over and over. So to cut it short. I would like to thank everyone for being a part of my life. Technoblade never dies, and neither does the server. goodbye. this journey has been a roller coaster, and I love roller coasters. but this roller coaster had to end eventually just like every roller coaster, it doesn’t last forever so don’t be scared of it even with the highs and lows. Just enjoy it with its speed, and with its slowness. I can’t get over this it’s been a part of my life forever. i’m sad. It’s never gonna come back again.
The dream smp was like, my childhood pretty much. And it will always be the best
I wish All 6 BEST PLAYERS COULD OF BEEN ON FOR THIS BUT WE GOT 3  TOMMY  TUBBO WILBER PHILZA DREAM  AND LAST BUT DEFO NO LEAST                           RIP            KING OF DREAM SMP            BEST PLAYER ON SMP           MY PERSONAL IDOL       ❤❤TECHNOBLADE❤❤ Thank you to all on the server for helping me through year 5,6,7,8 and as this server shuts I go into year 9 I thank all of you for my favourite players and my heart is shattered when Tommy walked into techno’s house and he wasn’t there. The best moment was the pogtopia time my 4 favourites on the same team The blade Tommy tubbo and Wilber. And the saddest moment is on the 1st of July 2022 when techno’s death was announced and it sucked so bad because his death day was my birthday and I remember putting in all my birthday money into his Merch. Thanks for all the best moments and goodbye

FUUUUCCKM IM GONNA CRY
3 months later I am finally ready to watch this video and god I'm gonna miss 2021, I don't even know what to say. Just wanted to leave this mark for future me that will definitely come back here once. And I bawled my eyes out real good when Tommy visited Techno's base.
This video made me laugh, cry and feel sad. Great work technoblade
Such a Hero.🥲
On witch Server host  did Dream got this Server?
Bit late but I just realised. Techno wont be in that final group photo. RIP.
I will miss the old times for dream smp and I miss everything about dream smp and I wish lasting for years 😢   but didn't last long time 😢
The end.
I'm crying my life out rn, I watched dreams smp for 1 year
R.I.P deem SMP🫡
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I wish that tecnoblad was still alive for this
im extremely sad that the dreamsmp just ended, i was having extreme fun watching the videos of the dream smp especially quackity and tommyinnit they were very funny❤️
Yeah i mean I cried for techno's death but THIS IS NOTHING TO THIS BRO I'M IN TEARS
Dear all dsmp members, thank you for making hard times in covids fun for us. When lockdown we all seemed pretty down until we found dsmp. Because of you we forget about that stuff and laugh every stream. So thank you deeply.
Noo😭😭😭😭😭

when dream smp endsi want to be able to download the world file so i can visit my favorite places on that server like techno's house rest in peace techno
Thank you for this amazing journey
this video made me beyond sad… i’m 18 now… can’t believe time went by so fast
I cried when he went to Techno’s house.  I miss him so much. I miss seeing his new uploads.  I watch his old videos and I end up crying because he helped me through so much. He’s one of the sole reasons I made it through middle school. I’m about to be a senior in high school now. Every now and then, I randomly think about him and I smile, then there are other times where I end up crying.
the dreamsmp CHANGED my life before I even had an acount it’s sad to see it’s gone but the memories I made along the way is insane so goodbye…
Dream smp was so good
sad
GG
i'm gonna miss it it changed my life thank you
good
Why
I’m not crying you are 😢
LOL
Don't be sad because something ended, be happy because it happened
Tommy always makes me laugh
This video honestly really touched my heart, through covid all I would watch is dream smp, and yes I got bullied for it but even leaving the fandom, coming back to see it's over now is really something to feel. Goodbye dream smp, shall you be missed by millions 😔💔
Its funny because the dream smp is the only thing that kept me going when my grams died. The only thing, without it i would be dead. And im not saying dead as in a joke i mean really dead.
It’s sad to see that techno couldn’t be there for the ender dragon 😢
I drew a picture of the sunset
This is so sad it ends..Dream SMP cured my depression and give me happiness back then it  hit hard when techno was no longer here with us😢
the techno part killed me man... dsmp has chnaged all our lifes for the worse and the better, we made a family with eachother and these streamers. i love you all!
I love the Dsmp and even that it ended I'm still posting videos about it, and allot of people are to! I'm scared that some of our favorite duos are not going to like hang out anymore, and are not going to talk anymore after the dsmp. Maybe I'm just dramatic. I loved and always will love the dsmp, an still watch you guys ofc, but I'm not ready to leave the fandom yet. The dsmp has helped me so much for the past 2 years, and it will always be in my memories. I'm not going to stop re-watching the dsmp lore, and just the fun times. I hope now that it ended the friendships will stay the same they did before it ended. I'm not going to say goodbye to the dsmp yet, I'm just not ready. I love you all and I hope you all stay safe. Oh and don't forget Tecnoblade never dies!
the discs playing, and those memories… i can’t stop crying…
9:14 "i forgot i wrote a part 3" LOL
Even if technoblade isn't there I can still feel is present it's like he never left. The Dream smp has changed my life even through though time I will never ever forget this era ❤
Nostalgic
me who was late and had no idea that dsmp actually ended: oh sh---- I am       not okay :D
I know with the world download they all have of this world I know for them that world will feel empty without everyone there
No words... just... o7
Gosh I'm fucking crying every fucking time i watch the last vids I miss dsmp
beautiful.
we all forgot about itsalyssa
Ahh good times dream smp so much things uh it hurts me to see the end of dream smp it really does
Will we ever get to see this server ever again in the future. I hope we will
11:01 When tommy goes to techno house
I started watching the series because it's how I cope but now it's kind of sad that the series I loved and reason I just started my YouTube channel has quit and it's gone my heart is already aching
Even though i am 3 months late.  It was sad for dream smp to disappear. It started everyone in the smp's career, it was a fun and weird experience.
Rip DSMP you’ll be in our hearts forever
Damn. I was here before and now. Its the end. tysm tommy
I’m going to be truthful, I have been staying away from this video for months… I only started watching DSMP for about a year now but this still feels so bittersweet… I had always wanted to watch the streams and get into this community because it looked like so much fun! But when I shared my interest people would tell me it was stupid and such so I never had the chance to get into it. And then things just started going downhill in my life. So for comfort I started watching Tommy, Ranboo, Phil, and Wilbur. And boy they have changed everything for me! I went from having no one to having best friend because of watching the DSMP! She explained everything to me and we started watching streams together! One of my favorite memories with her is this past winter watching the final DSMP streams through Tommy and Tubbo’s pov. Though I still feel like I’ve missed out I’m so, so glad I found this community and can’t wait  to see what everyone makes next! 💜💜💜 O7
The techno part and you grabbing the disc made me cry so hard
1:35 had me rolling😂
Dream smp has not only been a life changer for the streamers but the fans aswell been here since 2020 so much of my life has changed throughout this I made many friends and memories simply off of the dream smp as just a viewer it's honestly unbelievable although during the end bits I didn't watch much it still had a huge impact on my life
Tommy only cried when he cried for the king
finally bro
finnaly lets go
BRO FUCK IM CRYING 😭
Its hits so hard when u go to techno's house😭 R.I.P techno
Dude the stronghold at the end was cool
In like 5 years you should come back
I've been watching dream smp since it started i am sad and happy at the same time this will be a best memories for me
i have chills

3 minutes in, loses his last life
I remember when tommy and techno made were both living in that house together and now looking back on it techno made would've still loved to be in that house still but seeing this makes me almost cry again
GG
Last night I had a dream about dream an a I being friends, but we were friends and I woke up and saw this [I'm not crying tubbo is]
It hits very hard that techno didn't take a screenshot with them But at least we can imagine that techno was there happily
I remember when techno and dream escaped prison but his dog apollo died, technoblade never dies😢😢😞😭
o7 <3 TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!! ❤️😔😭 Thanks for the great series!

Achievement unlocked! “Free The End”
allow me to represent that one part of the comment section: thank god
The Dream SMP was an amazing story, and I’m glad to have seen all of it🥺
When I starting watch dsmp is always make me smile, laugh,but when I watch the end of dsmp, I start to cry........      Thank you dsmp to make us happy, laugh and rest in peace techno🕊❤
I didint watch this until now because I knew it’d make my cry and jesus it’s so nostalgic seeing it all again and all the memories, DSMP was such a big part of my life having watched it since the beginning and I am so grateful for all the awesome and funny and so cool moments we got to see, thankyou for everything DSMP :’)
I can’t believe it all ends here, at least it ended on a good moment.. for the most part!    We will miss you techno!
I’ve watched dream smp so much. It always made my day, and it’s very sad that technos gone, I can’t believe that dream smp has finished but I’m very glad it’s happened. I started crying when Tommy went to technos house. Rip king ❤
❤ ❤ ❤
Tommy listen what about ur promise to exists are u really going to break that promise
Stop this made me tear up
Even that I left the fandom about a year ago this still hurts. o7
RIP technoblade 👑🕊❤️😭🐷
Im gonna miss evryone And the hole dream smp 😢😢
Bro I'm crying fr
We will miss dreamSMP
I really wish you guys didn’t quit
techno somehow getting the big lore disk randomly would be completely in character
We'll miss you
I hit me when you're in technoblade house
wait dream smp is never hacing another season
noooooooo
LETS GO
SHROUD LIVES!!
I hate myself because I left in the middle of Tubbos stream bc it was late and when I woke up like three hours later I saw Tommy's tweet I was like "Oh fuck. Its actually real" and then now, every time I see a "ending dreamsmp" edit on tiktok I tear up but I'm happy I joined the fandom about two years ago. It brought me joy and jokes. It sad that Techno wasn't able to see the end but he is defenitely proud of them. I will not leave the fandom for a looong while. Long live the DreamSMP o7
I only found the smp when it was to late I have been told about and I see how much I missed out on if anyone can give me an explanation you can use detail or no detail i just want to have an idea of what I sadly missed out on thank you if any one gives an explanation
Gay vibs
Even though i left the fandom a year ago,i still almost cried watching this video,o7 techno.
End of an era
When he said we lost who to sex i laughed so hard
I watch again and again, yet I start to cry at the end-
8:40
Tommy : you baby, you crybaby i never cried on camera! 365 days without techno: Edit: WAIT WHAT THE FUCK WHY DID DREAM HAVE A CROWN FROM TECHNOBLADE
Damm
Just in my mind as soon as Tommy started to ring that bell I could hear Technoblade yelling for people to hit the subscribe and donate. He has mentally conditioned me with that bell.
I really did enjoy the times I spent watching streams and binge watching lore videos until 5am it really changed my life. Ik some would say that, that is cheesy but its true. I found a new love for the game, became more myself, gained friends who also watched DSMP, found new YouTubers to watch, and even found new bands to listen to. I am so glad that this was started and I am sad to see it go, but I know down the line I will sit myself down with a blanket and some snacks and watch back on old videos and remember the good times. The times when I was the happiest. That is all that matters to me. Thank you everyone for this wonderful experience. Goodnight <3
Man this is bringing up a lot of emotions for me... I know it's weird but the Dream SMP got me through some of the hardest times of my life, and I couldn't bring myself to comment the first time I watched this video, but thanks to all the people who helped me, Tommy, Techno, Wilbur. Technoblade never dies!
The Dream SMP. I cant even imagine this server ending because it truly changed my life. From boring Covid Lockdown days to coming home and sitting down and watching the streams. The Lore and the story always blows me away from how deep and how many hours people took writing those scripts for an hour stream. The people on this server have truly changed me. I used to go on crazy tommy streams onto chill tubbo streams and see the differences they make as people. Techno has been a giant park of this server, he made the story so much better from being a villan in some or a hero in some others to just being a nice person has shown me so many things. Thank You.
lol the book said dear sam not dear tommy
Tubbo's hit always the last
Love the Zelda music added in during the ender dragon fight.
does anyone know the music used in the final bit as they kill the dragon? 0:02 (timestamp is just for attention bc i am petty)
SHROUD NO DONT JUST LEAVE ME :(: 3:17  like all the women in my dms
Tommyinnit: Tubbo go away I don’t like you Also Tommyinnit actually I earn money off him 😂😂
Techno gone, now the Dream SMP is gone? Two nostalgic memories have been saved.
Idc
I'm not crying you are😭o7
14:08 obsidion 💀btw great video,tbh dream smp changed my life im just sad that it ended and fly high king🐷👑.

GET OFF MY LAWN
5:32  “Oh, that’s unlike him” 💀 Excuse me WHAT IT IS LIKE HIM
I will miss techno:(
So sad I never go to watch a live stream on the dream smp :’(
I miss thechnoblade and the end Just made me cry❤😭😭
14:51 this grp scene is not so complete without techno😥😥
I can’t believe it has taken me this long to watch this video. The dream SMP will always have a special place in my heart ever since June of 2020 I have been dedicated to first dream  and then the SMP which brought along so many great content creators that I will always love dearly. Thank you so much everyone for always bringing a smile to my face. I love you. Thank you for the happy and even the sad memories. ❤️❤️
I'm never leaving this fucking fandom I'm swear I really wanted to just start bawling.
The end of an era
I just saw this rn and im in tears i will always remember dream smp🙃
o7 techno
no please dont end it.    just please
THANK YOU TOO TOMMMY
🍎
you can hear the pain in tommys voice when he talks abt techno
shure you never cried on the dream smp
watched the smp when it started, even though it got boring after the dream imprisonment and i really cant stand yall its nice looking back
I said I wouldn't cry... I SAID I WOULDN'T CRY ...
About damn time it came to an end. The amount of Dream stans this server made is RIDICULOUS.
I'm having tears
When you visit technos house made me almost cry.....
Jolly good show
What a adventure we have had Bois 😭❤️
I was here since the start of l’manburg and seeing all this unfold into an amazing story with great characters it’s been crazy thank you tommy for helping all of us with this amazing series
im watching this again and im now sobbing
i've been watching the smp videos for a long while, what feels like since it started.  i really hope we have another smp, this was amazing...
It is crazy to think that Techno is just gone now.. No more funny clips of him absolutely shitting on someone or just being funny in general. It is quite late but I just missed this and felt that I needed a refresher with the finale being the best choice. I never actually did but I wanted to thank the whole SMP as covid was a particularly hard time for me and it helped me cope when I was in rough positions, especially Techno and Tommy. Thank you for everything, and as Techno would say ‘bye nerdssssss’
im sorry this made me cry i take bac kwhat i said i have been watching ever since and i kept along and i did not even know that this was out here
Ngl tommy is maddddd annoying he has no chill
I'm gonna miss this😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thw word technoblade makes my cry 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
i realy haved fun tommy in the dream smp videos i realy wanted to join u guys or meeting u and i could'nt but i realy haved fun thank you tommy and all the dream smp but i realy have a big  idia you will see it soon and you will like it
All of this is hard - tommy quitting smp server shut down techno is gone dream barely ever uploads and tubbo disappears
the dream smp is one of the most coolest servers every buye bye dream smp rip blood god rip technoblade rip dream smp bye bye king
GG
Dream smp has been a part of my life for the past 2 years its been a great journey watching dream smp and also techno will be above looking down smiling at you
if i could go back to 2019-2021 , i would fucking take that chance so fast.
It’s been a pleasure. So grateful I got to experience this journey along with everyone else. Thank you Tommy 🫡
This made me cry bruh😭
Why did they end the dream SMP? Are all of these people still making videos in the future? Someone please tell me
cry..
2 years and no enchanted tools or armour
Dang not me crying
As much as I thought I was cringey at the time when I enjoyed watching dsmp, i will miss it. It got me through 2020 and 2021 and I was so happy at the time. It truly gave me good memories. And rest in peace techno blade, you were amazing and will forever be history and be missed.❤
The edits make it so sad
If I'm being honest, I didn't want to watch this video because I refused to let go. I didn't want to believe that it was actually over. All of it. The Dream SMP raised me. I wasn't here from the start, I joined a weeks before the stream where Tommy locked Dream in prison, but I got hooked instantly, watched all lore streams, the animations, the bloopers, the manhunts and bro... I don't think I'll ever recover from this, from the memories.  Dream SMP, I love you. More than what you'll ever understand, and I miss you. A lot.
Its over. But i know deep down we are all glad we could see how it gone... It was good when it lasted, and i can confirm it by myself, since i was a big fan of it in 2020 to 2022. Rip DSMP. missed by many, hated by many, but special in its own way✨
gg
I am cay😢😢
14:38 just killed a woman feeling good
when the first time i watched the Dream smp it was good and now its over
Now that u stop playing there can i get the ip?
This video made me cry so hard. My "DSMP phase" was the happiest time of my life and I'm so sad it's over. But oh my god nothing hit harder than Technos death. It breaks my heart he died before his face reveal or a big meet up. I miss him so much, and will forever remember him and this server. Thank you Tommy for making videos like this one and always cheering me up, especially during covid, it was a scary time for all of us. I will never forget the excitement when I saw a notification from twitch or YouTube announcing you or one of the others posted another lore vid, and staying up late to finish them, or the sadist animation vids and your guys's reactios to them. The whole vibe was awesome and most of the community was so fun and supportive. I'm so grateful the dream SMP was apart of my life.
Don’t be sad it’s gone. Be happy it happened
AHHHHH "BRI ISH TEETHHHHHH"
whats dream smps code too go in dream smp
im crying..
These were my childhood and I will never forget all the vids I hope the SMP commes back 1 day I'll be watching all the vids again
i’ll miss technomann nnnn
"I've never cried on camera" 8 Days ago (Cries on camera)
Remember everyone don't be sad it ended be happy it happened
the last bit of dream's face
techno never dies
Anyone else cry
It was a mistake putting volume at 50 when tommy screaming and cussing
FINNALY THE DREAM SMP IS SO FUCKING BAD ITS LIKE A FEVER DREAM I HAD NIGHT MARES BETTER THAN THIS I SAW ROCKS BETTER THAN THIS
Yall remember Jesus loves yall remember to repent and turn to God Amen❤❤❤❤
anyone knows why it came to an end?
iv been a fan of tommy sense hypixle days and by far the dream smp ear has been my favorite all the laughs and tears and everything has left a inpact on me and so many others o7
u cant just stop brooo

He sad but he not cry 😢😅
S*x mom is evil . Ok is right but whaaaaa😂😂😂😂
Hands up who wants tommyinnit smp😅🤚

Techo never dies! Tommy don't cry!
o7.
I’m crying😭💀 like the Dream SMP practically raised me. And knowing that they won’t open the server again dude. Just hits hard.
The star jump song, just like jschlatt.
Don’t be sad that it’s over. Be happy that it happened in the first place. o7
0:04 dont you think this would be a good time to say..            *JUMP IN THE CADILLAC*
o7
2 months later and I still miss it. I was there in tommy stream. All the memories we had. I wish it was still going. And we will never forget the dsmp.
Dream had a point when the spawn was so gay lol,
Might have been crying and ive only been a fan on and off for the past 2-3 years but its still sad
"im the main character"  Techno is the true main character 😢😢
o 7
bruh moment
It’s only been a year since I discovered the dream SMP and it’s already going away… I only got so much time to watch it all happen.. at the end, I started crying. Why did it have to end? Was it because of techno's pass? All the depression built up and you don’t want to experience memories you made? I hope this has an explanation.
thank you for going at techno's house tommy. and thank you for these two years too.
Technobladeeee
Why doesn't dream sound like Dream?
I'm ganna miss the dream smp man😔.
Rip teckno
THE END OF AN ERA
I love that this brought a genuine smile to my face
It took me so long to build up the strength to watch this it’s currently July 6th and I cried watching this but I love the memories that the dream smp gave me ❤
This is like... the first video I ever cried in seeing all the memories I watched all of that and now it's the end. 🥲
So sad😢
Techno is the real mc
"This is so sad, I'm crying"  🤓
Why was it the last one
Do not mourn that it has ended, be happy that it happened.
I'm crying...
why did it end tho
Lets not cry because its gone Lets laugh and have dun that we have been gone through it
i never watched the streams, never there for the hype or the chill, but it had such a large influence over my friends, and some of my families, lives that it also changed mine. Some of the clips i had seen were funny and honestly showed me that i had been missing out. if i could go back and watch it all unfold i would. This was the end of an amazing era that inspired many, so to the members of the dream SMP, thank you for being the light to lead many people out of darkness, and also, RIP Techno o7
im so fucking glad that we were able to see the smp grow with tommyinnit. i wouldnt have traded a millon of memories to forget this.
that video is like a movie
Its sad to think old memory :( but happy end
Why is it ending
I love the dream smp soooooo muchhhhhh
This video made me tear up
A lot of people love to talk trash about the DSMP series in retrospect, but man, to say it was anything less than monumental would be a great understatement. I miss it.
o7
My heart hurts
Honestly, Technoblade was the only reason I ever watched ANYTHING with Dream SMP. The concept of DSMP was great, and the story was good. the only thing that ruined it was the fanbases of the Youtubers who made it. I fucking hate those "Stans" for ruining this server.
Dream just deleted his face reveal on YouTube
This made me cry I don’t think that technoblade would of want the smp to shut down but this hit my hart love you all and Fuck you badboyhalo lol
wow the smp has had such a good impact on my life an now it’s done🥲rip techno and I hope everyone has a great day🐷👑
Just rewatched this and cried this is my childhood (kinda) love you guys ❤
wow
This map and all the people in it are amazing and have given me so many memories. Im gonna miss it. Truly the end of an era 😔
I was 8...when I watch your video... And now... Is done, is fucking done🥺😭you make my childhood...🙁but all have a life... You have a life...but now, we here, they here, you here, and now... We says "goodbye dream smp😭"
i saw this video while scrolling through youtube. and it made me cry after 5 years of not crying. giving back memories of all the streams i watched of tommy and others playing the server. and lastly made me remember techno. i love you Tommy. your one of my favorite streamers. and i wish the Dream SMP would have stayed for longer  i loved watching all the videos and how your yourself. <3
I'm actually crying...
I am one of the biggest dream smp fans and its so hard to see it fade
Make Tommyinnit SMP :)
...
Goodbye dream smp😢
When the whole smp took the picture without techno it just hurts
I loved all the time watching the streams the vids the clips. It’s so sad it’s ending. I’m happy that majority of you guys killed the dragon. But it isn’t the same without Techno. I loved this series.
DO YOU WANT BE A HERO, TOMMY  THEN DIE LIKE ONE  by techno
Its hit me hard when Tommy looked at the barrel with techno stuff with ut
So sad tecno isn’t there to kill the dragoon he would’ve wanted that
He always starts with a bang 💥 shouting having fun  And ends with making us emotional 😢
DAMN. I NEVER WATCHED THIS SERIES BUT THE FINAL EPISODE MADE ME WANNA TEAR UP.
I balled my eyes out when he went to technos house
Goodbye dream SMP   this was the best series on youtube i've ever watched
it’s so nice to see with no lore the whole smp and dream work together
There has been hard times but every single day after college Tommy you stream at night but never gets tired and you have done a lot to make us happy so DONT leave the dream smp you have made us super happy with dream smp pogtopia your disc war and l’man berg war so many events and wars but every single war or events you got hyped and happy but you stopped playing dream smp now so thanks for streaming us dream smp even tho we couldn’t but you can I just say goodbye now bye dream smp
10:58 - when the tears started
I am not going to say much but salute to technoblade the king salute to dream to tommy and to the rest of the dream smp .This was part of our childhood. Now that it ended im gonna watch everything from the start.
2:07 You said ?
o7
This will forever remain in my heart. I watched everything that happened here for 3 years and ho, to express my words ...After so many years, it's over. We have always been with you. Dream SMP is one family❤️Techno will stay in our hearts forever, he was a great person who contributed a lot to this server. I can't believe that it all ended so easily and I will remember it every single day.Sometimes I even want to cry remembering all this, but these are tears of joy, tears of victory and what we went through. Thanks everyone! Those were the best 3 years of my life. Goodbye Dream SMP....
Technoblade never dies <3
Dont cry cause it's over, smile because it happened o7
Why did the SMP end?
I remember when I used to watch these streams, before the LGBT shit. I was watching the stream of the whole war thing back in 2020, those times with Covid were both good and bad, I was in the sixth grade at the time now I'm in the ninth.
Then this will be the last sunset of their lives, someday... (irl)
10:50 rlly is making me cry
ive been here since the start and i am glad i made it to the end
This is hilarious💀🗿
When it was first created I loved it. Then It got bad b ur finally it’s over I will miss it ❤
The DREAM SMP was one of my favorite streams to watch, it was fun while it lasted, and <3 Lmanberg!
its been a lovely journey thanks for the memories Goodbye Dream SMP
Goodbye Dream SMP and R.I.P Technoblade❤❤❤❤
Had me in tears, and people say it’s just a game, forever the DSMP will be in my heart😢
It is impossible to say that it's just a game
one of the best eras of my life! thank you
o7 this was my childhood and the thing that got me through the tough times
6:25 im not shitting you i literally spat out all my water on my keyboard.
2:45 "bottom text"
FUCK tecno part always makes me cry 😢 (tecno never dies)
seeing techno's house made me feel odd knowing that one of the greatest's was no longer with us. it made me sad but happy at the same time and i do hope that there will be a season 2 for the SMP as i never got to catch any of the streams. RIP techno and god bless the SMP crew.
Dream SMP ended without Technobland.
had fun
“Technoblade Never Dies.” Last Video, Man we really..
Dear tommy and whoever else might read this, Here's a fun fact for you, I refused to watch this stream and video because truly deep down I didn't want it to end. Tommyinnit, Tubbo, Dream, Sapnap, Eret, George, Techno, Skippy, Bad, and everyone on this server were my high school years. I've watched them since my freshman year and the DreamSmp helped me get through tough times in my life, the story and people made me laugh, cry, and once even scream so loudly in my house I got a sore throat. This server was everything to me. It introduced me to a new favorite band (Lovejoy) and gave me a community to be in. I've met many irl friends who have this same interest with me, and I love them dearly. I got to talk to them about the new lore or streams that we thought were funny to us. Now I'm going to be a senior in high school and I'm absolutely terrified. Tommy's most recent video with his memories with Technoblade is what brought me here right now. I realize that I didn't want to watch this because he wasn't going to be in it. I am so sad that he is gone but like we all say, technoblade never dies. That saying is on my door to my room, and I see it every day. I watched this video to give my thanks on the years of joy and fun that tommy and everyone on this server gave me. I'm glad it's over so I can tell others about the most wonderful times in my life and these memories will be one of them.   Thank you tommy for all that you did for us. Thank you for giving me so much joy in the world. Thank you for introducing me to many wonderful people to watch such as yourself. Thank you for making these videos. Thank you for making this video that gave me even more laughs and a big smile on my face as I watched.  Thank you DreamSMP Sincerely, Lei♡
So that's what happened to the SMP. It was great
o7
This is the first video I've ever seen and I love it already my friends have told me about it and I watched the fan videos about techno and I almost started crying
What's the music called during the end
'Nothing Gold Can Stay' - Robert Frost
rip
Only one thing that I want to say   o7
thank you.
2:06 Tommy "ive never cried on camera" Welp 2 months later and hes tearing up talking about techno. reason is understandable tho
I just watched a video of Tommy crying in a sad Techno video and in this vid he says “I’ve never cried”
was macht ihr mit der deutschen Gesellschaft ihr dämmlichen wichssssd
o7
This made me litte cry wth man
My heart hurts
o7
We all know Ranboo is the main character
Makes me sad techno wasnt there for the finale. Rest in peice king and goodbye to the dream smp. o7
Rip Technoblade Technoblade never dies😢
I’m going to cry
What the dreams smp seed
I’ve lost so many people in the past year. I miss Technoblade as if he were my own brother. I’ve lost several people, and now that the dreamsmp is gone too, I’m at my worst. But thank you for everything, Dream Smp.  Tranquilx out.
4:41 the little brake between lighting that tnt up and actually saying ruuuuuuun took ages💀
1:35 WHO IS THIS BITCH ON MY LAWN
🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡 bye techno bye dream smp 🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡
I started crying stoppp 😭😭😭😭
Its sad that Techno's house and his pets are just abandoned now, and everything is depressing there without Technoblade. R.I.P
This was a good smp got me threw 2020
It is quite funny to think about that Tommy in some way may have resulted in Dream deleting the face reveal LMo
That was my favourite
I’m actually crying
When they killing Dragon i feel like technoblade fight with them...
This is gonna make me rewatch the lore streams😭😭😭😭
dream smp changed my life so much and it hurts seeing it gone but im happy it happened it hits hard seeing you walk by technos house knowing he was once there 💔 i’m sad it over but it will always be great memories 😭💔💔
but why did it have to end..?
Love you Techno o7 <3
There will be other servers but none of them will compare to the dream or should I say the technoblade smp I know I was never on it but I still have memories on it I spent the last almost 3 years watching this server techno made this server great so did everyone else I always thought this server would go on forever or at least I hoped it would I keep watching every dream smp vid every stream every techno vid hoping for one more vid.Goodbye dream smp😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
11:46 one of us 😢😢
sadly technoblade was not here to hug the end :(
poor George
poor George
when tom was in techno's house, I may have cried...
I stopped watching the dream smp after pogtopia, but even though I stopped watching looking back always brings a smile to my face. I remember I first heard about it because of the Sad-its animation for the l’manberg revolution which led me to watch Tommy’s and Wilbur’s videos on it. I remember watching the election live. I downloaded twitter so I could vote in it then I immediately deleted it as soon as the election was over. I remember watching what felt like every stream for that arc often watching multiple streams of the same event. I stopped watching the steams after that arc was finished and Jschlatt was overthrown, I remember watching techno say the words “you want to be a hero Tommy? then die like one.” And I remember vividly the impact those words had. Even though I stopped watching the streams I still loosely kept up with it mostly through Sad-ist animations and stream clips. Sometimes when I was doing homework I would put on a dream smp stream, usually Eret or Technoblade. It was actually in an Eret stream that I first heard about Asexuality and after they described what it was I looked into it a little deeper and realized I was asexual. After Techno passed I didn’t really watch any more of the streams. It felt weird without Techno. The closing of the server I saw coming but it still feels so strange. It was such a big part of my life during Covid and led to  discoveries about myself that I don’t know I would have had if not for the dream smp. I have amazing memories of the server that I will always look back on fondly. Thank you and everyone involved for those memories. o7
I hav ti watch it all over
How many inches is like the God damn? Crusty crab😂❤
It’s really sad not to see techno in the last day but every thing he had will still remain alive in some sort of way.
it's real 😭
o7
o7
Wow
Man the fact this server is abandoned is soul shattering
o7
I think I’m crazy because I think ed Sheeran sounds like Tommyinit😐
Are the others still playing the SMP?
Why did he leave the SMP?
Damn. Dream with Techno's crown.
Last Video is not the same without Techno :/
Miss the dream smp
damn the techno part hit like a train :'(
R.I.P Techno😭 I cried for MULTIPLE reasons😢
Read how to sex 💀
Tommy and all the others was a escape system for me and many others to get away from the real world. Thank you Tommy for making videos and just being you.   P.S the last bit where tommy and tubbo were listening to the discs and chatting made me cry
its sad to see the smp end
15:13 Tecno would've loved to be a part of this and the group photo 😢❤👑 o7  Rest in Power Blood for the Blood God... Skull for the skull throne
Naaaaahh is hit me alot then u because dream smp is gone with every techna buil and his pet and achievements that they done😢😢
I will miss DSMP ever since I saw their videos in 2021 and it just wanna make me cry
Yaknow i used to absolutely love this, eventually it turned to be a phase and its been a while since it, but damn, this shi hits really hard, i had a lot of good memories attached to all of this.
Who else cried when he went to Techno's house? o7 to Techno. Bring down the Kingdom of God up there, big T.
These are one of my favorite videos tommy
2:34 my favorite part
THIS MADE ME SO FLIPPING EMOTIONAL!OMG MY FLIPPING GOD!

Why is it the last vid in dream smp??😭
This has been the best journey that I have ever been through! Thank you too all of the dsmp members for making my life, even in the deepest times the best! I’m so honoured that I even saw this from the start!  I hope you all won’t split up! Stay together and make more memories with each other!  Love you all 🫶🏻 P.s. thank you for making me cry today! (Happy tears!)
I cried- happy tears

TO ETERNITY AND BEYOND

I haven't watched any of the dsmp streams for a long time but I'm still sad after finding out that dream smp is actually ending, hope you guys have a great life and take care, this will always be in my memory 💗
First time whaching his videos and I taught he had a Yugoslav flag in the background.(I laited seen that I was wrong)
We need a DREAM SMP 2!
It’s so sad that technoblade didn’t get to see this. But I know he has seen it from heaven. Reminiscing about the memories and the mistakes. Yknow I kinda didn’t like you guys. But the memories of when I watched you guys was amazing. RIP Techno 1999-2022
Bro yall it hits way harder since techno wasn’t there for the end
NOOOO IM GONNA CRY 😭
No, you've definitely cried. On camera even.
I hope Dream SMP can be a Tour
o7 to The Dream SMP o7 to Technoblade o7 to the memories, friends, and family made along the way
I keep rewatching this cuz it's so sad,I even cried cuple of times I just can't believe it
Tommyinnt: "I never cried on camera!" Also him while visiting Techno's house: sobbing intensifies (I'm making this joke because i wanna hide the fact that I miss him too much)
This like actually made me cry…
Good bye high school nights
Song name
this smp is the best smp. it's sad because the legend technoblade is not with them in the end. res in peace o7
Is it from dream
Nòoooooooooooooooo
I beat that technoblade would of loved it
I am crying from this even though I wasn’t even in the dream SMP it’s so emotional
:(
I miss 2021 :(
😭😭😭😭
I love that "read how to sex" is the 2nd highest priority lmao
Just the sight of Techno's hoke made me cry. Just knowing that he's not with us anymore made me cry. I genuinely Don understand how some people got over Techno's death, i could never. The fact that Tommy shed a tear when going there just had me in the floor. I'm still crying every time I see it.  Rip in peace king! Fly high Techno! o7
Wow I didn't know my first ever dsmp stream would be my last..
tommy its illegal to steal from the deceased
I had always been told about and heard of the dream smp during COVID but I never caught on then.  I realize now how meaningful, hilarious, and nostalgic it is. Rest In Peace, Techno. Blood 🩸 for the Blood Good.
Good game true legends never die
GOOD RIDDANCE!!!!!
tommy:ive never cried live  him leaving technoblades house: :(
It feels like a chapter of my life has ended after this
Nooooooooo
Season 2??
Old Is Gold.
I barely even know the background of all of this and yet it's so sad :'( do you guys think that you guys might go back??? In like a year or more just to look back??
O7 techno
I almost lost it when tommy when to technos house it was so damn sad I miss techno so much and I know everyone else does too R.I.P Technoblade we all love you
Legendary moment
Even though it’s cheesy, it’s true… “All good things must come to an end…”
This was cool to watch
Honestly, the Dream SMP should've been left as a memorial to Technoblade, so many great Technoblade memories are on it that should be preserved
pog

There better be a crack Sad-ist animation based off of these last streams, that would be so amazing
BRO THE PART WHERE U WENT TO TECHNOS HOME HIT ME HARD AND MADE ME TEAR UP
Why did they end it
Poor dragon had to deal with the WHOLE DREAM SMP
Im late by a month but him visiting technoblade house is just great
2 and a half years went by so quick...so many memory's,so many tears, and so many fun time. It's sad to see It go but all good things have to come to an end. Love you techno, we will always remember you. This video made me cry in so many ways. You changed my life Dream smp in the darkest parts of my life...this server will always be a staple in my memory... Goodbye, Dream SMP... you will be missed.
i don’t know what it was but whenever the flashbacks came through during the sunset it felt like we were all there to experience it.
I dont bevelive the last vid of dream smp and the last thing techonblade never diessss!!!!
o7  i fucking love this server, the events that have happend on it and the people
I still can’t believe techno is gone, it’s so sad, and it makes me even sadder that nobody will ever log into his account again
I loved this server so much! Thanks for all the amazing memories!
8:48 isn’t this awkward
where to download the world?
RIP techno I wish he was there 😢
When I was watching this I pushed my sister off the bed and her leg started  bleeding
Hahahahahahahahhahhaahhahahahahahaha
Damn that video hurts. Youch
Even tho Tommy’s laughing you can see how much he misses technoblade.
Its sad to let it go but im proud i got to be part of the fandom💔, bye s1 hello s2❤️
Why... 🥺😭
Even tho I left the fandom about a year ago and missed a year worth of lore it still hurts to see this come to an end I grew up with this series and it will always be apart of me
When I saw #2 on his list I was like- “oh”
tommy: I would never cry on camera also tommy: sheds a tear for techno R.I.P techno. o7
ngl this was my favorite fandom to be a part in
He should’ve been here 🩷🩷🩷 KING TECHNO 👑
Dream smp is a part of techno nd techno ia apart ofdream smp and u had a good relationship with techno  thats why prob
I started fucking balling my eyes out at the end
The first ever dsmp video was on this server, it changed my life. I haven't ever been so proud of being a part of a community despite it being the dumbest things ever. The memories of this place will never really dissappear, even techno. Thank you guys for changing my life. Fly high blood god.
you can hear tommy’s voice lower down and sound a little sad when he visited techni he even shed a tear
Goodbye dream SMP you were everything to me ill miss you
You guys gave me the best vivid you are my favorite YouTube rip techno you are all my greatest friends
14:18 My ADHD BRAIN 50 PERCENT OF THE TIME. 13:01  the other 50😂😂
12:50 Tommy:*Soo hyped* 13:00 Tommy:*So angry tries to kill his desk😂*
When Tommy is talking about trchno for a sec thens stop his face.😭😭You can tell the whole SMP misses him
Thank all of you for all you've done. You've been a huge impact to many people and I am so thankful that I am of those people who got to watch this crazy experience take place.  I love you all, and again, thank you. ❤
what a the smp numbers🤔
Hello im a big fan!!!!🎉🎉🎉
George is asleep again
Bro the only one isn’t there is the best player that joined rip techno
what was your FAV bit, tommy was thinking TECHNO bet
O
Ago what Read how to sex in 0:19
Ya techno will be happy he was there made his make a great person a great ally and  even tho we can't see him he was there on the last moments of the dream smp  My techno be forever in our hearts and everyone's in the dream smp  Techno blade never dies
I know you won't see this but it's nice that you used the same song as schlatt did when killing the ender dragon 🫡
Ah the good Memories 😢
That made me emotional
I wish Wilber and techno was in this vid
I’m a big fan you are the best YouTuber
Sad
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!!
Even back in 2020 when I was a bit late to the party I still enjoyed this and now that’s it’s over only memory’s remain. I’ll miss it
I Remember jumping on twitch to watch tommyinit play dream smp goodbye dream smp
I like how at the end of the video it shows me the very first dream smp video
so the server has now come to  a close one of the mostt amazing and inspiring servers ever made
Im crying so hard the memories 😭😭😭
As a dream SMP fan it hurts me to see this happen
:(
Dude i was shaking so much during the end of the video
how did hannah get elytra brfore killing the dragon
The last minute of the video with Tommy’s speech talking about covid and memory’s with tubbo and leaving the server made me cry for 6 hours straight
"Don't be sad because its gone, be happy that it happened"😭😭😭😭
I’ve been here since before Tommy joined. When it was just sapnap, George, and dream playing survival. And it’s hit me just how much that little survival world has evolved since then. How many people I had the pleasure of watching. All the laughs. All the times I’ve sobbed my eyes out at the story. I, regrettably, stopped watching in late 2022 for the most part. I’d pop in every once in a while but I missed so much. And that 2 years of my life has sort of drifted away. This video made me cry. Well done
The greatest memory of technoblade is now really just a memory 😭
Here’s a list of the funniest parts of the vid in my opinion:  8:59 10:08 12:52 14:08
I haven't been watching this sense the beginning, but I've gotten attached to it, it helped me when I felt sad, even when I was a bit depressed, it would always being a smile to my face, hearing Tommy's snarky remarks, and the way it was sorta relatable in someways, like when tommy gave up what was most prized for him, for his country, yet they had kicked him out when schlat became president, reminds me of how I've been used than left behind, and during exile when dream was manipulating tommy to believe he was his on!y friend, reminded me of my step mom, i felt welcome, related to, and comforted, like I was able to be myself without discrimination. But now the only thing ill have is memories, and getting to re-watch it, no hope or excitement while waiting for new streams, just the past. I will miss this. Goodbye dream smp, Im very grateful. Thank you for everything.
Gotta love the editor putting in “bottom text” towards the beginning of the video
“And the game was over.”
Missing it a lot, missing Techno too but im happy that you guys put this into a place and didn't leave it behind. This will never not be sad
Dreams voice sounds so much deeper than normal
Every second that you see is, 24 connected peaces, thank you for coming, thank you for staying, thank you for watching the show...
Did this kid always do dumb stuff he stupid
it would of been so nice if you had technos sword to finish off the dragon
That’s all folks
The realization of when everyone logs off forever. Their pets are just gonna wait for them forever.. but for me, techno's pets are never alone why? Because techno is still watching them in heaven..
At least keep the Smp, so you guys could visit it in the future:)
tommy annoys me bc i know what he has done
And that ...  That's the end...
I made a Tommy smp.. Well miss your vids!
thank you, dsmp. youve brought my pseudo-little sister to me, made me and my four best friends bond, and most especially, help me get through hard times. there will never be a day where i will not be grateful to the server, and the members. to each every one of the members, thank you. thank you, thank you, thank you.  the dsmp will always, and forever have a special place in my heart. their own little space, that nothing will ever replace it.
Tommy like trying to laugh but he cant hold back his tears
w
I ever watched the DSMP. I only ever saw the ships. But even so, I cried watching this, it hurst took so that no more of them ships, can art, and more, is never coming back.💗
Tommy: Because I am the main character Me: You clearly don’t know the name of the server 😒
Wow, so much memories. I don't know how to react.
Funny how he gets less and less views
The only thing missing in this video is Techno R.I.P may be gone but never forgotten
the part where tommy went to techno's base is recalling memories of both of them...I'm not crying you are
THE END
This almost made me burst out in tears
"Never cried on camera"?  A likely story.
Finally, dsmp is starting to die down
I know i’ve already commented, but I just graduated 8th grade yesterday. Someone at my graduation played hallelujah on the harp. I could only here the theme song of lmanburg. I almost cried. I watched dream smp when I was in 6th grade, when 8th graders seemed so pretension and old, and now i’m going into highschool, leaving this last part of my childhood behind. I have new friends, only 1 or 2 from my childhood, new passions, new interests, new relationships. It really feels like childhood has officially ended
yo tommy, can you provide a world download?
Damn i miss the good ol day
These 2 last year were hell of a ride for us the emotions the feeling we got when we saw the title "Dream smp" thanks and goodbye 👋
I don't know y  but I just cried
Man...  That's our response. Man, that was fun. Man, I'll miss this.  I'm very grateful that I was a part of this. Maybe a mere speck in the sea of veiwers, but I was there. I witnessed friendships, I've witnessed betrayal, I've witnessed explosions, (so, so many explosions) and I'll miss it, I will. We've laughed with them, cried with them and I'm proud to say I was a part of this. I must say, though, we're not going to miss the DreamSMP, we're going to miss how we felt when we first clicked on the new video. The DreamSMP will always be here, but memories fade.  Goodbye, DreamSMP, rest well.         "I'm here for a good time, not for a long time. "                            -Tommy
Omg I cried so hard when he went to technos house, technoblade will never die 🕊️
Tommyinnit's new name is now tommydamnit
i don't even watch dream smp and i've never watched technoblade but this made me cry
I hope that they all get back together again, i love these guys. I hope its soon, but when they're all ready ofc. R.I.P Technoblade, and goodbye Dream SMP
This smp was the only thing that I watched for years and now I sit here wondering what will happen now. Will there be another smp one day that will fill the void the smp left after it ended, or will we sit here awaiting a new chance to enjoy something with streamers we love. Its been an honor, goodbye dream smp 🫡
Goodbye dream smp,this smp thought me many things be myself,never give up and much more,it has always been my dream to be in this smp,and sadly we couldn’t see techno in this video but I am sure he would’ve been proud at the others,and always…rip techno🕊️
Can you leak the ip now?
Rip tecno Never dies😢
Why are You guys stopping on the smp
This era will be remembered
Keren. Salam dari Indonesia🇮🇩
This server has given us all, the audience, so much.
It was so depressing seeing the pain in Tommy’s eyes when he went to technos house
It’s okay Tommy, we saw you were sad at Techno house, all of us agree
my eyes filled with wootha.
I lost interest in the DSMP mid 2021, but i still am a technoblade (and technodad) but came back for this just for the shits and giggles
I CANT HE JUST-
I put off this stream for a whole month until now and the dsmp has been in my life for 2-3 years and its been the best yeras of my life. The part at Techno's house made me cry. Overall, this was the best experience of my life.
That look at the end Tommy gave us, just said to me Goodbye.. in all of sincerity, without swear or anything at all.. just pure Goodbye.. it's just sad
Me seeing Tommy in Techs housa just made me cry so bad.. and seeing that specific chest, just makes me cry.. it was always the things he has in his inventory..
old things go new things come he my not have twitch streams anymore this smp will always be in are heart i hope every smp member maybe start a new smp i hope they do or start a hardcore world maybe technoblade isn’t here he will always be in are hearts😊😅❤
Jesus fucking Christ man. Like a majority of others watching this, it got me in tears. Somewhat from my point of view, but honestly from Tommy’s, everyone on the servers in these last moments. Something which likely changed all of their lives. They spent so much time on that server together. This was a huge thing in their life. They would log in and play here, they would stream here, they would build here and likely think not too much of it. Now in these last moments, it must be difficult to say goodbye to it all.
i remember watching dsmp in 2020. those moments were so valuable, you'll only miss something if its gone. ggs wp tommy, niki, wilbur, dream and tubbo
i remember the first time watching the dsmp not knoeing how valueable these moments are, goodbye dsmp, tommy, niki, dream, wilbur, techno and tubbo.
Come on guys les appreciate the last episode we all cried for the last video
When he went to Techno’s house I shed the biggest tears ever 😀
Sorry Tommy, you're not the main character. The main character position can't be filled... he's gone.
Why does Dream sound so different?
Good bye😭😭
It ends without The Blade
WOW 🫡🫡
Sad ending of smp😢
This was an amazing journey to experience tommy I thank you with the bottom of the heart for making these memories and with all the people within it
I’m so happy I was apart of this community for so long. These guys saved my life when I was going thru deep depression
This is the last vid probably  witch just shut down the doors of pandemic ❤️
I’ll miss this and Techno. But i never realized Tubbo looks like Tweek from South Park-
Can you make like a season 2 of the SMP?
Dream: you know what tommy? Tommy: yeah what's up dream  Dream: i didn't realize your base was so gay    Wise words from dream
:(
I wish I was living 2 years ago... Again... I really2 wish it wouldn't ended, but... time passes, im growing, they're growing, we're growing... Oh man I'm really tearing up... It's ok I guess, but I will always remember this SMP, the one who made me found so many YouTuber, farewell, DSMP and fellow fandoms  Poggers
It’s been a good server, it’s sad to see it go :(
Goodbye, Dream SMP.. it has been a journey.
why its the last dream smp:(
Psychology scientists once said that when you get attached to something so hard..... when you lose it, it would feel like losing or saying goodbye someone dear to you
I was crying for technos place then laughing my ass off from the fall
"there's a radicalised green man chasing me"
I am sorry i am late but goodbye Dream smp.. we will miss all of it..
Byee dream smp
All alone techno knew that Tommy would look in his chest to steal things and so he left that in there
wow i did not expect to cry but im gonna miss this
We will miss the dream smp we miss it and techno his death was a big step down we miss him and the smp rest in peace
Goodbye dream smp
Thank you, too, Tommy.  Thank you too.🧡
The fact that this was actually sadder than I thought it would lol
вау, что это, ребят, идите вы..
LETS GOOO
“Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened"-Dr.Seuss

Techno with his ghost following them to kill the ender dragon is a great thing im imagining while watching the video
And with this… the past 2-3 years of my life have truly ended.. the memories of watching those streams ( specially techno’s streams) during the online classes and even after that.. joining the fandom in discord and making some really really good friends… also talking to my gf about stuff from the smp …. But now.. techno is gone…most discord friends have become busy.. moved to college…broke up with my gf after 3 years of beautiful relationship … and now the last straw.. dsmp has also ended…..well this was not the ending of  those beautiful times i had imagined… but those 3 years will forever be in my heart till the day i pass… and lastly.. ty reader for reading till the end… have a wonderful life:)
long live technoblade

I never thought I would cry so much in a video and Tommys vid. Crying while writing this comment. I didn't want to watch this video bcz I knew I would cry. Seeing technos house. Made me very cry. Will rewatch all of the vids.  Thank you for all of the memories everyone.  TechnoBlade never dies.
🫡
Im not a big fan. Didn't really like it. But god damn it, I'll miss it.
I've been watching the DreamSMP from the very start and honestly it's help me grow so much as a person. From it I discovered my love for writing stories and for that I will be forever grateful. Thank you so much to everyone on the server, and Rest In Peace Technoblade.
:) happiness .......
I nearly cried during it. When Tommy was at Technos base it made me tear up. Thank you for all the great memories❤
I'm crying!
Aww :(
Rip technoblade  :(  Him: after he leaves the house he laughs
It’s so sad 😢😢
They gotta WorldEdit techno's house into the new UniteSMP
I was in a difficult part of my life when I first found the dream smp and watching it allowed me to immerse myself in something outside of my world for long enough to heal, and now I'm in the healthiest mindset of my time on this planet. I'm truly grateful for everyone who participated in this and glad i was able to enjoy it while it lasted
Was so hayed for tommy
Me realizing the dream smp is over😐👍 me realizing the reason😔

It's sad that Technoblade wasn't there. TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
I loved how great cat sounds when they were going over their memories
I was crying while remembering all the memories you shared with everyone, its a shame that all of it ends😢
It makes me cry when you open TECHNOBLADES chest where he puts his stuff

Goodbye Dream SMP❤
RIP Technoblade we all miss you in the dream SMP and in life
14:52 s it just me or is a few people missing? I know techno is gone but what about Fundy Purpled and Quackity. Also i see Sapnap is missing. And also Connor and Ranboo
Genuinely a better finale then the actual lore finale
Techno's animals and foxes: I guess this is goodbye... Techno, we will be waiting for you in this server. Alone...
2:45 bottom text
This hits hard...
My childhood was build here and all the memories just went by in a flash
without tommy my life will be different. very different... goodbye legend this last moment honestly made my cry i remember watching you everytime. bye...
It was never meant to be.....
I’m not crying you’re crying 😢
I honestly can't believe that there will never be any videos on the dream smp I used to watch it all the time, it's so sad how everything has come to an end.
I guess is the end of dream smp.I really appreciate their streams in dream smp. I remember Tommy was protecting the lamamburg and it makes me happy because I like their strategies. I guess this is my final watching on Tommy playing dream smp,and I am sad because Tommy will never stream on dream smp. Goodbye dream smp I hope the map will be OK.   Byeeee technoblade never dies!.   Peace.
In covid I started to watch the DMSP and it became such a huge thing for me, I donated $50 tommyinnit tts with the jump in the cadilac lyrics and he almost passed away. The amount of amazing memories that tommy, dream, tubbo, wilbur and everyone else who had been in the server is insane, it's so sad to see the SMP go but I knew it would always come to an end one day. Thank you for all the sweet memories and times on streams, youtube, twitter and everything else. And one last quote from the rizz master himself  "Just killed a women feeling good"  - Tommyinnit
😢😢😢😢 crying in real life
THIS IS THE BEST ENDING
o7 to techno bro. May he rest in peace.
Tubbo speed run time 2 years gg
Man all the memories 😭😭 I’m sad it’s gone but happy it happened, one of the only things that kept me entertained through covid🫡🫡
Bro read “how to sex” the book is like House of Leaves, there’s lots of stuff everywhere and minor plot holes really leave speculation up to the readers, but my goodness I can’t forget the Falling Point, that part was the best part
A combination of the storytelling, emotional development, the losses and the friendships between everyone on the Dream SMP is so heart wrenchingly hard to let go of. Im going to miss all of this, I genuinely will. Thank you for everything ❤️😭
celeste music! starjumo (?) at the end of the dragon fight
Ya know, this helped me through covid too. It made me laugh and cry and a whole manner of other things. I guess it’s time to move on with these memories in tow. Ain’t that a bitch.
😢😢 an end to an era😢😢
dream smp is a server which changed me a noob to atleast average level and i will miss this server alot
I thought they've been doing YouTube on the dream SMP for like a year but almost 2 years
Idc if this was 1 mmonth ago im crying
I miss techno he made me laugh so hard like- but I'll show my kids in the future him and explain and stuff why it ended ,and if dsmp comes back than it won't be the same without techno
Did anybody else get emotional after he went to technos base
i never thought if watching this video and now i’m dying of laughter
good.
Not an end just a new beginning
It's hard that techno isn't here But it's fun because almost everyone is here Techno is basically watching them doing the final
Good Bye dream smp ❤
Good bye dream smp

This hurt watching, I remember 2 years ago bored in COVID and I started watching the dsmp, feels like a part of me is getting ripped
It makes me so sad to see this all go,I remember during Covid watching these episodes all the time and seeing all of them grow as YouTubers may this server rest in peace
Techno 😓 we miss you!
The. Blade~ 🗡️
i thought they were gonna kiss eachother at the end
bro i teared up, after seeing techno's old base, gear, his pet just i feel like idk how to explain it...i miss techno so much. dream smp change my life its sad to see it go but i'm happy it happened in the first place, well nothing lasts forever i still can't belive techno's passing. when i first started to watch the Dream SMP i enjoyed it so much the lore was amazing all the people were funny its just fucking sad that it has to go... holy shit i cried while writing this comment... well good bye dream smp....
Your pretty good.
WHY DIDN'T YOU BUILD A STATUE OF TECHNOBLADE!!!!!!!!
I hope tecno was here to kill the dragon with a steering wheel
I've been putting off this video since it came out, and when I finally started it I promised I wouldn't cry, but I've been consistently crying since Tommy went to Techno's house. This server and the people on it have and will continue to bring me so much joy, and I look forward to what's next. ❤👑
You know what they should do for techno? They should put pig snouts, and crowns on every build in the dream smp
Just wait until 2024, and Tommy will visit it again. I'm sure of it... right? 😿
I’m not crying you are… You know what really hits?  Techno wasn’t there to end it with everyone he helped start it and couldn’t end it
TOMMMYLNNIT Bother 😅😅😅😅😅 happy hahaha
YAYYY!!!!!
The past 2/half years I've been watching every video on another device and the parts with techno were just too good, and when I heard that the Dream smp last stream of Tommyinnits welp i broke down and all the memories I got COVID and stuff has brought me down I started watching Tommy dream smp and earth smp we all had one person who was our favourite And that was The Blade, NOT EVEN CLOSE BABY TECHNOBLADE NEVER EVER DIES!
This server is such a big part of me. I cried so hard and still am revisiting it now. This changed my life. It made me happy when I was stressed or sad from school. It drowned out the orgasm sounds coming from my dad's room once every 2 weeks. Everyone in this server (except Jack) saved me and I couldn't be more thankful for you all. <3
Well time for me too unsub and never watch Tommy again
Liar…
Sad-ist totally need to animate this one
Bye dream smp
You know lucidly roasts you about being a kid in her videos 😂😂
Ngl that made me cry I kinda left the fandom in 2021 but this hit hard it’s hard to think there’s no more dream smp but as a wise man once said (not even close baby technoblade never a dies 🕊️🕊️   -goodbye dream smp
Uhh can anyone answer my questions? Why is this the last video of Dream SMP🙁? Is there not gonna be a Dream SMP anymore? I don't understand...

Brooooo I don’t usually feel things but that one got thru *sobs*
There was once a great king who was part of this server alongside tommy and all the other legends that were part of the dream smp. He may be gone from the world, but the king himself is not forgotten by his fans. The king of his viewers, the king of the pigs, the dream smp will be with us in our memories always.

i shed a few tears as soon as i saw carl and all of technos pets a waiting fpr him
I've been here since 2020, and it has been such an incredible journey. Thank you, Tommy for making this. This video really means a lot to me. <3 It's hard with Techno being gone, but I think he would of really loved this video & would've been very proud. You've all come so far. I really appreciate all of you. You, Wilbur, Bad, Charlie, Dream Team, Ranboo, Tubbo, & many more of been such a comfort to me. The last few years have been really hard for me, and the dsmp videos have always cheered me up. Goodbye, Dream SMP.  o7 Technoblade never dies.
Make a discord server where all the Dream SMP members are on and other fans are on too.
Tommy: "i am the main character" Me: then why isn't call the tommy smp huh huh?!
This video is the most emotional of all I will never forget the Dream SMP I actually cry tommiy thank you very much for making us happy and to the Dream SMP 😢😢😭😢☹️
Wait does that mean tom is done with YouTube forever??? ( no hate I’m dumb)
the dream smp has been around and played forever! this was amazing all the stuff that happend in the smp and all famous youtubers were there too techno ranboo dream every youtuber we know and love a few years later techno died sadly😞 but the server has been arround for like a long time! but goodbye smp smp that was always amazing and funny and well.. everything! this is the best smp and all i want to say is,        Goodbye.
The first time I was sad to see something.. Go😢
I will always remember the DSMP, and it will still remain in a big chunk of my life. This series brought me so much joy to my life, lifting me up everyday!
the end of an era
Watching tommy going to technos house made me get emotional he will always be our legend.. Alex may be dead but. TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!!
why is it the end ???
The smp was the only think that got me through covid. I discovered it while bored locked up in my home and have been watching it ever since. I hope we get something similar soon. ❤
Im imagining Techno would try and kill all of you while saying " Technoblade never dies " in his best voice. Rest in peace, i know Techno wouldn't want this to happend. Im trying to hold my tears while typing this. Rest in peace Techno, Rest in peace Dream SMP.
bruh i cried before everyone in dream smp could i'm such a crybaby. but technoblade never dies that's what i came here for.
o7s for techno and the server
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
You should make one more smp
i really couldn't stop crying after watching this
Techno's death took a apart of my soul with him now that Tommy went to his house and found the disk I can't stop crying
tommyinnit  is still the best youtuber ever 😢😢😢
it still hits so hard
L
😢
If only techno was there
Im Cry r n
Why did they even stoped?
Thank you for everything Tommy. Cheers to the Dreams SMP
Technoblade is prob watching tehm all together even tho he's gone TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
Honestly i had kinda left the fandom due to certain people, the lore going all over the place, and just overall it getting out of style. I still come back to Tommy every once in a while and still enjoy his content so this does feel a little bittersweet
Good bye Dream SMP and rest in Peace technoblade 🥲
I miss                                        🕊️Tecnoblade🕊️ Tecnoblade Neer never dies
Is everybody quitting the server😮
I've been watching the DreamSMP from the very start and honestly it's help me grow so much as a person. From it I discovered my love for writing stories and for that I will be forever grateful. Thank you so much to everyone on the server, and Rest In Peace Technoblade.
o7
this made me cry at last .... tommy ur the best !
im not in the fandom anymore and i havent been for the past year but watching this made me tear up remembering all the good times and i wonder why i ever left :,)
That COVID line was hard
Everything is sad here but the most thing that breaks me that technoblades pets are waiting for him no knowing he well never come back 😕
I will always remember the Dream SMP fondly although I didn't watch it from the start only watching after techno joined it and I always thought it was lame after a while i can't help but cry when i watch this video. I'll miss it. Long live the Dream SMP.
This took me forever to watch. It was my safe space whenever  I needed it. It took me so much courage to watch this, but after I did, I realized, it hit me really hard. I am glad I watched it in the end because I realized that I shouldn't cry because it is over, I should smile because it happened. I am so glad that this happened because this was a huge part of me that I will forever cherish. Thank you for everything. All of the times you made me laugh, made me happy, made me cry, and made me feel like me. I thank you so much for that.
Technoblade was gold but it ended🙂techno is in a better place now
2:45
Damn, i can't believe it's all over now.
Yay
I'm really going to miss the dream smp
I miss you...😢
rip techno
is this really the last video?… I don’t believe if it’s the last dream smp video….but  this is emotional 🥲
know that when you get to the highest point of your life, you can't relive the moments that you overcame to reach the highest
We might never know what's in Techno's enderchest.
the only dream smp streamer who is sane and is funny, other than techno (the legend never dies)
me watching this vid 😥😥😥😥😥😥
I have watched Dream Smp for awhile and it's sad to see that techno wasn't there in the end. But no one can say that because "Technoblade Never Dies"
Would Tommy stealing from Techno's house technically be graverobbing?
Finally the circus is over!
the worst thing technoblade not in their :(
14:29  sHoot dA woMAn sHoOt da WOmAn iN tHe skYy!

I never really had followed all the lore on the server but I loved to watch some of the moments on and off lore and I can see how magic and great this server is, some things are just eternal or memorable and leave mark, sometimes a game can make a lot of great moments and memories!!
What a fucking outro mate, I will miss being able to watch these videos on the SMP. I really hope Season 2 comes around eventually.  R.I.P - Technoblade I always loved watching Techno’s content. I also loved watching other people get absolutely shit on by him. We will miss you king. (- Mr. Prince)
Well boys I can finally rest easy knowing that this shit hole is done
Thank you <3

This was genuinely so emotional, even though I sort of left the fandom and everything surrounding it the Dream SMP still was what got me through the tough times of covid and I will be forever grateful for that. Thank you for that, you helped so many people to relax and find comfort in those times of distress, you and all the other members of the SMP and the SMP will be remembered as a pivotal point in internet history, I'm sure. Thank you for the laughs, the smiles, the memories, the stories, it has been an honor watching and joining you on this journey and although some things may end, this is still just the beginning of your career and I look forward to watching you continue to grow and make content. Thanks for everything Tommy, and to everyone else from the dream SMP, especially Techno o7

Words and pixels cannot even describe this moment.

bro i just search tommy and this video shows up and at first i thought it was a joke until i reach the end, since the pandemic started i even  i started watching dream and tommy`s lore like 2021 ig but i miss those day and now tommy is now saying good bye:((
I always dream everyday that I joined Dream SMP but now it's gone.
It was sad to see this smp finally ends. Also there were a lot of people missing.. I don't know much about this smp so I don't know if those people just didn't show up or what. If someone can explain please do. : )
Will miss this smp and i would never be able to forget it love you all guys
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Two weeks later post to new videos
*I'm not crying your crying!!!* 😭
i just noticed that at 2:45 there is a fraction of a second where it says bottom text and now i am perplexed
I have watched the dream smp since I was 9 and now being 14 this year it makes me so sad that it has ended. Just tommy going to technos house made me cry because it really hits when you realize that he is actually gone and just reliving all of the memories or watching all of them back it will nvr be the same and just so many memories were made and they are still there but now there will not be anymore on the dsmp but I’m just happy that there will be new memories made . It’s just sad that it’s all over now 😕
o7

Tommy said he wasn’t gonna cry
i thought it was gonna be april fools. highly expecting it-
The nostalgia here was real. The world will never be the same without the Dream SMP.
Honesty......I cried.  I remember waiting for tommy to stream just so I can be entertained for hours on end. I always used to say "bye everyone and let's hope he streams tomorrow" at the end of EVERY STREAM      This hits hard
Why does dream sound different
One day we will look back at the DSMP and be flooded with nostalgia.
finally
I can't believe that the dream smp is done it was awesome 😢😊
17:52  no, thank YOU Tommy!!
Bro that gives so much memories watching tommy playing technoblade honestly that video and the techno part made me cry and also i remember how in school with my friends were like yea yo btw dream is preason one of my friend even made a drawing of dream and i bought it was soo good time i wish it happens again o7

the Dream SMP was the smiles in my days I feel so crushed from it going away, but all things can't last long....oh crap I crying now, each like on this comment will be a Dream SMP memory in our hearts :_).
You going to Technoblades cabin was so emotional
What NOOOO
long live o7!
Hey Tommy, i know that there is a very slim chance of you reading this, but honestly, thanks for entertaining us, you're the person i look up to in YouTube. I can't imagine how it feels for you to click the disconnect button. Watching it bought tears to my eyes. I will support you no matter what, my english king
Am crying rn
I stopped watching the dsmp after maybe a year of discovering itm but through that single year, i made many online friends, and i genuinely  had fun.  Its sad to see the smp go, but everything comes to an end.
Pls don't  I love the dream smp 😭  I will never forget the DREAM SMP❤
Im gonna re-watch the series
thanks for making me cry
Title says last video of dream smp😢
I never watched the dream smp much, i maybe watched abt 30 mins of a stream or 2? But after looking into as much of it as i could.. i wish i watched it from the start. This smp has been amazing, even though i wasnt there for any of it.

God loves you and Jesus to.
A true flood in of memories  and wonderful times🥹(this is the closest emoji to how I feel) 🪦R.I.P. techno
rest in peace techno as the crown says you are our king o7
I’m so sad to see it go
❤❤❤
Put a momerial for techno
Man I’m gonna miss the smp so much (I mean that literally because I missed the last dsmp stream ever because school and it was a shit day😭)
No because I started crying when Tommy went to techno’s house I KNEW I was gonna cry and I was right, it’s so weird because I’m not at all an emotional person but techno man 🫶
NO NO NO NO MORE DSMP PLSSSSSSS. I've waited so long for more :(
I can't even describe how big of a smile I had the entire video, and what a rollercoaster of emotions it was. Goodbye Dream SMP, thank you.
Aww poor Tommy I feel bad I can’t believe he was hiding his sadness behind laughter😢
honestly, i met so many lovely people through the dream smp and it got me through so much. i'm so thankful for the memories i have of all of it from 2020-now :) it breaks my heart that it's over and i'm definitely going to miss it but i'm so excited to see what the future has in store for everyone <3
dsmp was a part of me that i would never want to let go especially techno, never wanted to think about it getting so bad (ykwim) needed this video so that we wouldn't have to worrry without a finale finale
Is it just me or is dreams voice different
Only 2 years to prepare to kill the dragon
Well, the smp didn't have lore before you joined so... And also yeah matpat literally called you the main character
Is the George smp finally existing
I watched every single stream i wat he'd every single video of the dream smp at hurts to know that this was the last video.. I'm happy it existed and sad that it ended.. goodbye l'manburg and goodbye dream smp...
It just all hit me hard while watching this i get emotional a lot “i cried lol”
:,) o7
And tommy put the beggining at the ending as the end screen  daft punk style
it had it run. it was an amazing story crafted by even more amazing people. nothing lasts forever. im just happy that yall were able to let the smp go.... well... not without some chaos to end it off. goodbye Dream smp ( truly the tommy smp ) you will forever be missed.
Y is it ending
this was the best series of my life man thank you for the long journey man no one will ever have something as good as the dream smp thank you for the entertainment in the tough times in life and all that it's sad that techno didn't get to stay but the king is doing ok for sure! thank you tommy thank you!
RIP Techno and goodbye Dream SMP
4:45 this moment tom tommy proves hes a chaotic child.
Rip dream server, forever in our memories
We could clearly see that tommy got emotional when he talked about technoblade
Dream SMP got me through covid, the tough times when i fought with my family and my wntire life. i can't beleive im seeing it end..
I'm so emotional and this is the first smp video I have ever watched
Did even someone visit techno house after his death
It hurts me that dream smp ends but we have to accept it, I'll miss dream smp.
good riddance dream smp fuckin sucks ill see ya in hell ehehehhe!
Dream smp was the most amazing thing I have ever seen, I am so happy that it was a thing but so sad it is finally over. And seeing things like the disc’s, Technos house…., The fan art if techno well I only have one thing to say… dream smp lives on, The story lives on, The king lives on Let’s say it for the king Technoblade  Never Dies
i started crying the second i saw the snow, i knew then that he was at technos place. i dont have alot of money atm but fuck the second i get some im buying anything i can
Is it bad that I cried? Dream smp got me through some of the hardest times of my life
i still remember sitting on my couch, scrolling on tiktok, and seeing clips of you and Tubbo be saved by everyone in the server when dream was about to kill you in the prison, and from then on i decided that maybe the dream smp wasn't so bad. i'll forever cherish the fun i had waiting for the lore streams, rewatching all the dsmp videos everyone made, and just everything about the community in general. i had never been so happy watching youtube before, i've had so many special and amazing memories with this server, i just can't list them all. so incredibly grateful that i had your videos to help me not lose my sanity in quarantine, i would be lying if said i didn't bawl my eyes out at this video. you truly made this server so memorable, thank you for everything Tommy. <3
The Dsmp was the best time of my like I wish I could go back to 2021 were I just discovered techno it’s sad having to say goodbye.
i didn’t really need to cry tonight but i guess i did
why....read how to sex........why?.....WHYYYYU
Imagine dream smp reborn with all new people and all new lore only in my dreams❤❤
him visiting techno's house actually made me shed a tear. o7 to the king
i actually cant believe dream smp is going i didnt believe my friends till i actually saw this video today
God, i-i got a bit emotional :,D Welp uhh, guess that's it huh? Well, See ya later tom.
12:50 JOJO-     HENNRVII-  ~~~~~~
R.I.P.
@tehnoblade
watching Tommy hit Techno's channel member bell when I had my "Good game Technoblade" hoodie almost put me in tears.
2:45 "bottom text"
That music towards the end as he explains his best part is just so WHOLESOME <3
RIP Tecnoblade. tommy you had so much to lose but techno was the worst for me.
This actually made me cry, the way tommyinnit just talk weirdly while looking at techno's house and his facial expression. the way i saw tommy's face like sad just made me cry.
I've been here since Dream's first stream, 2 years later, it's gone. It's been a wild ride. We made some friends, we lost some friends, there was battles, there was wars.  And finally, we lost a king, but he will forever stay in our hearts. Rest in peace, Techno. We love you. o7
I cried
o7
I know its been years but the time when tommy went to techno's house and the outro hits different but we think that what techno's want for his life Id wish that he was in this bit for leaving the dsmp but it happend already so R>I>P to all memories with techno and the others
Why huh Tommy is weird
Man im going to fucking miss the Dream SMP
:')
so it means no more tommyinnit
The nostalgia on technos base
Who is this bich on my lawn got me lafing
I am completly new to this, can someone explain to me why Tommy left?
When Tommy went to technos house i thought he was gonna randomly appear and kill Tommy and i realise....
Now fight the Warden
After this vid, youtube recommended me the first vid on dsmp. I hope more smps do this ngl.. and maybe they can all make one more (like qsmp right now)
It would've been good with techno in there hehe Also I noticed most of the members aren't there..
Don’t be sad that it’s gone. Be glad that it happened.
o7
"this house is bitching, tommy
Its so sad that techno didn't get to see the dream smp to end😢
I never watched the dream smp but it seems great maybe I’ll catch up on the vids
2:45 *bottom text*
2:45 bottom text
Goodbye, DreamSMP
I was here❤
This made me cry because tecnho didn't get to join but the past 2 years I've been watching this server is a memory..
Whyd i cry
Even though I left the fandom watching this still hit hard…
I'm not a ddmp stan or anything. But I used to watch it since the beggining. Since everything started. Maybe even before earth smp. And techno as my inspiration to this game. I thank you tommy for the good memories we made with each other.
im never watching Tommy because of this
I am getting Unas Anus finale vibes :'D  That was incredible, at least we still got the vods!
Techno would be proud.
F
My sister showed me this show. I thought it was ok, little did I know it would make so many memories.
LETS GOOOOOOO
Bro 11:06 hit me hard 😭
Tommy is like stich, he destroys everything he toucges
You can hear in Tommy's  voice he is trying to hide the tears when he's in technoblades base
I started crying after the end - Like Damn this hit hard
o7
This makes me emotional because I loved this series to see him do everything and visit everything again plug technos merch and also to see technos cabin again the disks I honestly never thought a bench and a cabin would bring tears to my fucking eyes😊
I watched the dream sup videos like once or twice in my life but it still feels like a train hit me it just feels so sad🥹🥹
It’s 4am and I’m finally letting myself watch this
It feels so amazing to be one of the many people who are dream smp fans. This video made me very emotional but I guess the good things don't ever actually leave us, they live in our memories, forever.
I might cry I don’t even watch any of you anymore but I saw this and knew I had 2
My nostalgia and sadness… I almost feel like crying…   Edit: Nvm, I did cry a bit 😃
this video made me cry 3 times😭😭😭😭😭   ps:i’m gonne watch the first time tommy logged on the server
I’m going to the comments so I’d not cry the fourth time. Thank you for 4 years of my life.
In every video I have watched Tommy play I always see the duck…….the ducks gone now……    😭😭😭😭-I ain’t crying u are
YESSIR THE DREAM SMP IS GONE LETS GO
I feel like everything is dying rn
what a load of shite
o7 was a great ride!!
Tell dream to turn off the whitelist and leak the ip for the funnies
They are deleting the dream, SMP
Why did the Dream SMP end.?
Am sad now
😭 it's been 3 years since I watched tommyinnit with technoblade and philza
o7
I just got into this fandom and it shut down  A day before my bday it shut down.   Fuck.
It’s definitely hard saying goodbye to Dream SMP but I’ll be grateful that I had got to watch live streams, and experience it. o7
🥹🥹🥺🥺😭😭😭
The end was pretty emotional
Is it really the end?    🥹🥹
Bye dream smp thx for being here😢
im here
I fucking cried😢
это были классные 2 года моей жизни спасибо DreamSMP и тебе томми <3
its the last time  I was right
This was.. Intense
Ive been in the fandom since around the start of the smp, i wasn’t there to see the end tho, since i left the fandom in late 2021, but i still love you guys and you mean a lot to me. You all helped me get thru covid, thanks so much for the great memories <3
You just stole a DEAD MANS STUFF
the end of the DSMP is sad, It is also sad that Techno didn't get to be there.
Don’t be sad it’s over be happy it happened
holy shit finally
tubbo: whatsup? Tommy: shut tubbo u aren't sam
What a wonderful send off to DSMP. Thank you for letting us say goodbye Tommy. I hope this was cathartic for you as well. ❤ Looking forward to all of your other videos!
14:17 POV: my sleep paralysis demon crawling up my bed coming to attack me
Rip Technoblade
let's goooooooooooooooooooo tommy XD
Carl, Steve, and all those dogs waiting for their best friend to come home.  RIP Techno. Thank you.  I'm not crying. You are
end of an era o7
I never really had much time to put into this, I saw the first episode on dream’s channel and now this, still hits hard because I know the feeling of leaving it all behind, it’s not just the world but the memories with it, it feels like you’re leaving the people and your old self.
2:45 Mmmmm, Bottom text
So season two is not happening🙁
2:34 the silence after he killed the bee then just getting attacked😂😭💀
HALLELUJAH
Bro my headphones just died I’ll come back and finish watching in a bit 13:27
And then they proceed to violently make out
Honestly I wasn't a big fan of the smp but I was a fan of how it affected people for the better through the goods and the bads it seems like everything is ending now but that might be a good thing we need to make way for the next generation and hope they can be better rip dsmp rip techno and goodnight
When you went to technos I literally started crying
I knew that tommy was going to fail the mlg and he did.
There I go crying.
Im very sad to see the dsmp go, I will never be ready to see it go but I am happy it happened. It wont be the same without it but I got to find out alot of new youtubers from it and think of my own stories and make ocs as if I was in the storyline myself, IT opened up alot of new ideas for me and make me laugh, feel sad, happy, and freak out, Heck I even made a friend because of it. My heart sank with I found out its ending but everything has to end at some point. Thank you
o7
O7
R u quitting YouTube?
Damn 2 years of dream smp finally ends. I wish I could rewind time and just start from the beginning again
it’s weird to have realised we’ve reached the closure of dream smp
:(
12:10 I legit broke up in tears
The dsmp got me through some stuff in the last while, im sad to see it go but there are SUCH good memories tied with this server. Rip DSMP.   (side note:) IS IT JUST ME THAT FORGOT THIS MAN HAD A GIRLFRIEND-???
i used to watch this dude on DSMP vids. best moments of my life.
12:58 he actually did place water but server lag lol
im going to do the egsact same thing when we leave our erver
Dang that sad
I've been watching dream smp since the beginning everyday I would come home from school and just sit on the bed watching their newest video they always make me laugh and get me through the hardest day I always got so excited to watch them and when I heard the news about techno I cried for hours I couldn't get over it then dream smp has come to an end it makes me even more sad (I'm still crying while writing this) they made my day everyday thank you for Tommy and everyone in the dream smp you all have been a big part of our lives and dream smp will always have a special place in our hearts you are all the best thank you all,especially techno o7
tubbo is the main charecter
I’m not crying your crying
Imagine being annoying and sad about leaving a fiction world 🙄💀💀💀
You really got me crying here Tommy
Everything goes fine you being happy... Until... you see the gay flags
crying the entire time
So painful to see when one of the favorite contents has to go...but it's fine...it is how life goes its way 😣😖
Am i the only one to cry at the ending?
me realizing why dream has a crown on his head
Hi Tommy when are you next touring in Leeds? My daughter wants to see you on tour but it's impossible right now
ok
FUCK YES, LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
I started watching this series two years ago, man it hits hard when you love a series and it just ends. Hopefully there will be a new series that i can enjoy as much as this one. Maybe the tommy smp? lol
Your dog water
Hi
I cried,DSMP is over, I'm so glad I watched this since Techno is Alive😢🥲
has anyone noticed how dreams voice changed in his last videos and here?
Thank you Dsmp
Rip dsmp
Happening in dream smp:  Dream is losing Speedrun sometimes. Tecno d*ed Tommy is quitting
Make dream smp 2 please
the dsmp helped me through depression and im do happy that i found you guys at the beginning of the server, and after i got better i didnt really watch it anymore but i would still watch the lives from time to time. and even if i didnt really watch dsmp much, this still hits so hard for me, thanks for everything honestly
Sad
this genuinely made me cry, thank you for all of these moments and i hope everyone else who watched these videos with me enjoyed them too. the DSMP is probably one of my favourite smps to watch in my free time. have a good life everyone.   -random person in the internet
I was so sad at this moment i watch this video! Thank you for the past days! you make my days!
DSMP series was better than a tv series fr !!!
This hurts to watch i miss techno so much 😢😢 it hurts to see the dream smp end. I will cherish the memories of this smp.
Tommy: just killed a gogy!! Im feeling good😅!!
I have no words just sadness...  In these moments I look back all the time I spent looking at anything related to the dsmp and not knowing what it meant or knowing and watching the vods so I could catch up to see the never coming second season and understand it but it is now that I realize that this whole server isn't just apart of Tommy, Tubbo, Dream it's apart of everyone who has been in it or seen it we all are apart in the dsmp and although we have ner played on the server we still made things happen even people who never saw the streams live we still did something and in these moments I would like for everyone look back on the seconds when each one of us found the dsmp and engaged to it and became apart of it think of all the memories and all the messages you sent or thought of all the things you did and all the things you loved about this server and remember this, this sever these vods these memories they cant die they cant disaper the day any of this dies is the day when every edit, clip, streamer, vod, viewer even the game dies that is when these memories will die and when these feelings die.  Thank you dsmp and its members and viewers for everything for making a part of me for making me, me and making me feel so happy yet so sad for all of this, Thank you all.
o7
Some things can’t last forever. Man. It’s heartbreaking
If you really wanted to make us cry you shouldve edited technos best moments in the dsmp
NOOOO

My fucking childhood was that severe and these people and all the streams and I’m going to be sad that it is gone but one thing is I’m so glad it was they’re it was there the times I tryed to kms and the reason i didn’t was because of the smp and just seeing technos house and the pets hit hard I’m am literally crying I love this sever and the people in it I have watched this since episode one of the smp and the war the exile the lane and drista streams the prime path with techno on the pig I was there cherring you guys I was there and I’m just so glad that this was filmed and everyone will know what a staple this was in so many lives for Covid and what happened in are years if anyone where we are old want to know
Please tell me you guys are joking and Tecno is alive please tell me that this is one of your sick jokes tommy
Goodbye. That's all you can really say.

this whole thing followed me through my teenage years and I am so grateful to have a piece of media that I can always turn to when i miss being a dumb 14yo stuck in my room in COVID. it has followed me through the good and the bad. thank you to all the content creators who made such a pure experience possible. I will always remember the Dream SMP. <3 we win these!
This almost made me cry halfway to th3 end
Thank god I waited ages for this!! Thank you mid smp ❤️❤️
Technos pets are waiting for him for eternaly is sad...😢
0:20 Read how to sex💀
The dream smp was literally my life it's really sad to see it disappear, raise a hand🤚and say, 🤚long live the dream smp
As a person who has never been a fan or hater of dream let me just say I only watched dsmp for anyone else but dream mainly techno and now that it's ending I would just like to say to ya tommy that you have an amazing fan base behind you and you are going to go places you never thought possible don't rely on other people's ideas go free style on your own with your own friends and worlds be you
I’m truly thankful for the DreamSMP.  It has given me a place to escape for the past several years, even when I was at my lowest these guys were here and for that I will be forever grateful.    Thank you guys…. You deserve the world. o7
I want to check the comments but everything is so melancholic and brings me too much sorrow. And I don’t even know why? I barely watched the dream smp? Was it about Technoblade dying? I am ultimately confused and don’t know what to think…  Why does everything have to end?
I never really watched the dreams smp but I watched a lot of people who are on it like Tommy, Tubbo, Wilbur, dream, George, bbh, fundy and Technoblade. I found out about Technoblade death on the day I arrived in finland for my summer holiday. I woke up checked insta or whatever it was that I checked and someone posted about the so long nerds video. I didn’t believe it so I had to check it for myself. I watched the video and couldn’t stop crying for the next few days, my favorite YouTuber was gone, forever and I couldn’t do anything about it. After that my summer holiday was still good but the fact that he passed made me very sad and at random times I would just stop and be grateful for what Technoblade has brought us. “Technoblade never dies” o7 🕊️ a legend forever in our hearts
The hardest thing for me to handle right at the end is that i got a suggestion for Tommys FIRST ever video on the dsmp. o7
Although I never watched dream smp seeing how much it meant to Tommy almost made me cry
14:08 BadBoyHalo: I coveret it in obsidiOn
It feels wrong that techno wasn’t there 😭
Techno was my favorite part of dream smp
OH MY GOD! THAT VCIDEO WAS SO FUNNY HAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHA,MY KIDS WILL LOVE THIS🤣🤣😂😂
thank you :(
the history of the dream smp and techno shall never EVER die.
Techno died 9 months ago i guess time flys faster.
I like how this is his last video and the reccomended is hos first 17:50
i cant wach
This reminds me of “me and the birds”
ender dragon more like ended dragon
I cried so hard at the end and i dont know why. Maybe it the sentimental attachment i had to this server. Even though i wasnt a part of it, it always felt like there was a bit of me in every piece. Like when you bite into a slice of pie. You can taste it was made with love, specially for you. The DreamSMP was that pie. And the final bite was taken. It was such a pleasure to be part of this fandom, and i hope that we can keep the legacy going. Tommyinnit, your poggers m8. Been a pleasure knowing you and all of your friends. God i cant even see my keyboard im crying that hard. The technoblade house was the part that got me. I couldn’t stop crying. May you rest peacefully king, and may you and your friends legacy reign supreme. ..👑🎗
I loved the Dream SMP. When it first started I found it through Tommy. That is how I found out about everybody else, including Dream. I loved watching the lore and story unfold. Nothing will beat the time before the whole jail/prison storyline towards the end. After that, it got kinda boring and lost some of the magic and I never finished that part. This has been an amazing journey. Thanks to everybody on the Dream SMP for the amazing entertainment.   Rest in peace Technoblade. You will be missed...💜
Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
All things come to an end but there are some you just want forever and it's sad when you lose them   Rest in peace our king  Technoblade never dies
Thank you dream smp. Goodbye! I love you for all the memories.
Im so sad about technoblade
SAD-ist. I want to you make an animation
It hits me hard that Techno is gone but his home and his pets are gonna sit there, waiting for him for eternity.
thats..... sad
As the saying goes "Every good things must come to an end". Thanks Tommy!
you are stinky poo poo fard init bruv
We do a bit of trolling . A over use of trolling.  A extreme and an un justified amount of tomfoolery.  A extreme amount of causing pain
There was always something about the DSMP that nothing else had. Lifesteal SMP, it wasn't emotional, they gladly left the server, and never had a connection.  Just the fact that all of you shared memories on the server made it so special. Even though it was accidental xd (Cuz Dream originally didn't want to invite Tommy :p) it was worth the while!
W
bro 50 bucks for a hodie tf tecno gonna do with 5o bucks in heaven??
😢 this has been honestly two and half years of my life as well but I'm looking forward to seeing what everyone has in store for us
Moving on is hard, but necessary. Have strength.
NOO I wanted to join dreamsmp:(
Never got emotional in your videos.Luv it
o7
“That’s unlike George”  Nuh uh
even though i left the fandom long ago, i can’t say that dream smp didn’t have any impact on my life, especially during covid. i joined the fandom in 2020 during the lmanburg era, and the lore of lmanburg genuinely caught my interest, and i enjoy watching tommy, techno and tubbo hang out with their friends. the smp actually got me and my friends closer, bc we had our own smp to hang out after class (or even in class lmao) everyday during lockdown which is really meaningful to me. even tho some of the streamers on the servers had created controversies (the one i didn’t really watched so idk what they did) the server really held a place close to my heart.  so yeah, goodbye dream smp
Is it deleted?
Farewell.... o7
😢😢😢
Turn back time, gonna hit rewind
DAMNNNN THIS IS SAD TOMMY IS FINALLY GONNA TOUCH GRASSSSSS
Ik i should be happy but it hurts sm.
I joined 2 years ago and even tho i didnt see other parts i am grateful for making me happy even in my lowest days
THE LOOK BEFORE HE JUMPED IN BROKE ME 😭
Techno didnt even get to see the end of the smp 🙁
Z
if techno was still here hee wouldve killed yall while watching the sunset XD
Dam tecnoblade cant beat the dragon togeter that make me really sad man Tecnoblade Never Die❤🔥
When u went to techno`s house😢
Imagine they went to the Strong hold techno blade found near his base for the finale and fixed it up
Do you miss techno
Help I’m very confused I haven’t watched Tommy in so long
Thank you dream SMP for all the funniest moments & all the amazing times we had watching it😢
Such a bitter sweet moment
Tommy I am glad you had fun in this server
Goodbye dream smp there are so many amazing memories and moments that will be treasured and apart of our lives. You will always stay in my heart. Thank you forever you hold and done for the whole community bye 💜💫
The Dream SMP meant so much to so many of us, we won’t forget it. It’s sad to see it go, but everything ends eventually. Thank you all for everything. And rest well, Technoblade. o7
*dream discussing Tommy’s problems*   Tommy: ok die-
This makes me sad I feel like dying now.
😢 good bye dream SMP 🖐️
Several DreamSMP members were the reason I kept going in life when my friends started ignoring me, my bullies got worse, and my family lost interest in me. I remember thinking one night 'I'm going to kill myself this summer.' and  that voice in the back of my head screamed out, "Tommy'd want you to keep going. Techno'd not want you to die. Niki'd be sad." And I listened. On that night I vowed to keep going. And now it's gone. Forever in our hearts, may the DreamSMP be displayed on full.
Holy shit its finally over
Everyone o7 it was a long journey but every journey has its end and so does the dream smp
I just came back and started watching the smp again so I’m very confused is the smp splitting up is tommy quitting?

I cant believe it's finally over.,  ik all of US, his fans aren't apart of the dream smp but it somehow feels it has been apart of our lives, forever, the dream smp really changed everything for me. It was an amazing experience watching all of the funny streams.. the dream smp will forever be in my heart <3 idk why I'm acting like someone just died- but I will miss everything so much..

Goodbye dream SMP And hello Tommy SMP
nuuuuuuuuuuuu please ima start sobbing.... don't go..... Dream SMP is my life..... RIP Techno....
Dont be sad because it ended,be happy that it happened-Sun Tzu
cried, you made my life so much better, literally took me out of my depression. the dreamSMP was something i could invest in and be entertained by and see all these different point of views, it was awesome. may not have been here after dream was killed in prison (and you too) but the 50-70% i watched was awesome. maybe one day ill finish the rest of the dreamSMP streams, but for now it’s goodbye to it! i do wish i had known about the stream though but i hadn’t kept up in a long time so i didn’t know unfortunately. i love you guys, especially that last scene with you and tubbo at the bench watching the sunset once more.

It making me feel sad bc this is  the last dream smp video,this video without technoblade was sad but I'm sure technoblade will still be with us ❤❤❤😢😢
I was here since the start (on Wilbur's side anyway) I watched the first couple dream SMP videos. And then I found Tommy. I've seen just about every piece of dream SMP content since the beginning and it's been a wild ride. Welp, cheers!
This video left me in tears and when Tommy hit that disconnect button for the last time I just started tearing up this server helped me get through covid and now that it is over and covid is over I’m mostly just glad it happened don’t be sad that it is gone be happy that it Happened
dream smp helped me during covid im so glad a was apart of the ride goodbye dream smp
This made me wish Techno was still with us😢
RIP Techno
l'm greek goddess 😁😁😁🖤❤🖤❤
We miss you technoblade❤

I joined REALLY late to the Dream SMP fandom, a bit more than 1 year ago a friend was talking about an awesome community, then i got tired and asked them to tell me more. This SMP meant a lot not only for the ones part of it, but for the million people who sat until 4 am watching streams. We all became sentimentally attached to this server... to this community. We all have our favourites: our favourite animatic, our favorite DSMP song, our favourite land/place in the server, our favourite moments even our favourite lines (or maybe we have a lot of/no favorites). We have won. We have lost.  Good things must come to an end eventually. This was or is the best thing in some of our lives. I want to thank the creators who made this possible, the community, Technoblade, and all the ones that once were into all this mess. Thank you for the best moments of my life and much more's.   With all this being said...  Goodbye, Dream SMP
the techno part was emotional :( This was so fun and wholesome
Wait he’s never uploading ever again?
Dsmp was the highlight of covid for me, i'm sad to see it go, but thanks, it was truley epic
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I have a question, for god….Why!!!!! 😭
One of my favorite things to watch.. so sad for losing our king, and this honestly made me cry and laugh at the same time.
o7
Yay, it's finally gone
This made me cry
i need your help
tommy
Techno will always be remembered alongside the smp. I hope to see more mod vids with the gang in the future
it’s sad, to know something you were so passionate about, something that you looked forward on the next stream about, end, it really is but i’m glad it happened, i’m glad i came across a video about this. o7
DEFINITELY ONE OF THE GREATEST ENDINGS TO A SMP🫡🫡 I saw the whole stream it was so incredibly amazing goodbye DREAM SMP🫡 and R.I.P Technoblade the man the myth the legend that we all know will never die🐷👑❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

why is dreams voice soo deep now
I loved the whole series of dream SMP😭😭😭
fantastic <3 what a sweet sweet video :)
Я плохо знаю английский , но DSMP стал для меня небольшой отдушиной. Именно благодаря этому чудесному фандому я нашла многих друзей и начала отходить от принципа : " Главное в жизни - учёба , а всё остальное не так важно" и это спасло меня от выгорания хотя бы на какое-то время.     Мне жаль, что ДСМП так и остался фандом для в основном англоговорящей аудитории, ведь с английским у меня всё печально(. Сейчас я на грани нервного срыва из-за проблем по учёбе и надвигающимся переездом ,но видосики по кубикам поднимают мне настроение и пускай я не до конца поняла некоторые моменты в видео, я постепенно успокаиваюсь.     Спасибо огромное за 3 счастливых года ! ДСМП в моём сердечек навсегда.
during covid i watched every stream and video twice, thank you tommy.
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Bro is tommy still going to post

i have never laughed so hard in a tommyinit video then gone to crying to laughing again to crying .. you did such a good job on this goodbye video and truely i think we all resonated with this time period .. i think for some of us it was our only joy during covid . it was one of my only joys.. thank you tommy for saying goodbye to c!technoblade too.. i needed that . keep up your amazing work.. its been an honor to grow up along side you and this server <<33
im not crying you are. 😭 the end of an era has came, i will never forget this. thank you for a great 3 years guys <3
Good bye to my most favourite server and o7
Good.
OH MY GOD NO TECHNO WHY DID YOU HAVE TO MAKE ME FEEL TODAY TOMMY AHHHHHHHHHH 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Rip Techno's enderman :(
Dream SMp changed my life a lot thank you for all the two years of streaming I wagched all of them you were my most favourite I remember I went on the stream and always you I also remember techno having such a deep voice it’s very sad to loose such a great friend thank you for entertaining me so much dream smp and mostly. Tommy love you as a streamer lol byebye dream smp I will always rewatch ur vids 😢❤🎉
In tears after watching this So many good memories of our life watching this server Entertained so many of us in the hard times of COVID It may not be a server anymore But will forever remain in our hearts
Even though I joined this fandom halfway through, I'm as grateful as I can be to everyone for everything they have done to me. Not only had they helped me pass through the toughest moments of life; when I had covid, when it wasn't so easy to live and many more reasons ahead. The way I was suddenly obsessed with this whole thing because of just one video from Tommy is absolutely fascinating, at least to me, I must say. These 2years or more have been one of the most beautiful years of my life. Thanks to dream smp, I'm myself. Dream SMP is the reason how I made friendship with my best friend.  Technoblade's presence in this moment would probably make this one of the most important moments and the most memorable times in history. Even though, the legend has said his goodbye, We still have him placed in our hearts. Rest in peace, The Dream SMP Rest in peace, Technoblade  MAY THE LEGEND REMAIN IN US!! FLY HIGH KING!! LONG LIVE THE DREAM SMP IN OUR HEARTS❤ FLY HIGH! o7
o7
It was a miracle having that server it is hard to leave but now it is time to start something new
I never knew how much thie would affect me. I wished this would last but sometimes we js have to let things go. I will always remember dsmp and all memories. It has been a crazy 3 years of life.
Thank god dayum
Wait so your not gonna be making videos anylonger
Holy shit man...
Did dream just hit puberty?
Techno passing away really got me sad he is a memory we will never forget and seeing the dream smp for 1 final time is so hard to see it become a memory to REST IN PIECE TECHO and goodbye dream SMP o7 😔😔❤❤
.
technoblade?
aww man 😒
I can’t hold my tears
we all wish that tecno was there at the end fight and kill the dragon rip tecno u will always be in our hearts
Welp Goodbye Everyone on Dream smp It was pleasure to watch u guys for 2 years,im tearing up rn i miss technoblade. o7
so sad that techno was not there to experience it rip

Thank you Tommy and the rest of the SMP. Even Dream lol
O7
o7
Finally this hell hole of a lore server is put to sleep

16:14 i hoped technoblade could have at least witnessed this alongside them :(
I’m crying after 3 years
in only like 2 years 13.3m sub wow
R.I.P
End of an era
Dream SMP was part of a time when we needed some fun. Two years through covid, we made it. What a memory to have, thank you for the laughs, and remember Legends never die, Techno never dies.  o7
Remember when ranbo and techno were in the boats saling while techno saying "Nooo im the sensei im gunna die a tragic death!" Now months later it has happend...
DREAM SMP SUCKS ANYWAY

Damn I realise now that I really wasn’t prepared for this. Techno’s house, walking the prime path, killing the dragon and one final sunset with tubbo 😢
its just sad that technoblade did not make it to the finale to be honest the dream smp was a smal world to the biggest memory for the smp themselves even techno wasnt there we still and they still salute to gim R.I.P TechnoBlade
dream smp was a legend
I only watched the amp cuss of techno. He was the best at improve and made the story sound more natural. 😢

Dream SMP was my childhood it just makes me cry seeing them leave ❤🥺
9:00
Is this your last dream smp sever?
I’m so glad I found the dsmp and joined the fandom. It had changed my life throughout 2021. The dsmp changed my life, I had smiles,laugh,and overall an amazing time in the fandom. It’s sad to see it end but I’m happy I was able to be apart of something for almost 3 years now and happy it happened in the first place I made so many other friends who enjoyed watching Tommy,Skeppy,and the other creators who were in the dsmp. I had enjoyed the lores,laughs,mods,and overall the wars that had happened. You guys were the ones who inspired me to want to become a streamer and Want to start my own YouTube channel when I grow up. Hope I get to go to this vidcon this year just to at least meet some you guys. Thank you dsmp for being apart of many peoples life’s and making it better. I’m literally almost gonna tear up rn because being in the dsmp made me meet my best friend Myah, dusty, and Ashton who are now apart of my life and I’m forever grateful for them. The dsmp may have been problematic and stuff but they made me get through hard times during Covid and school I joined the fandom when I was 10 I’m currently going to turn 13 wow. Thank you Tommy,dream badboyhalo,skeppy,Niki,Wilbur and many more who were in the dsmp especially techno. o7  Thank you dsmp!!💗<333
I cried watching this knowing it's the end of my childhood 😭
Well it was such a memory but we need to move on
This is true greatness. So many memories, and a world no one will ever forget.
We love you tommy
o7
I think the dream SMP would be still here if techblade lived.
Im crying rn that is sad, but i still have filling that dream SPM doesen't end
Poor Tommy he looks so sad
THE BLADE
All good things must come to an end.
The fact im watching while im sick <33
Crying my ass off
1:26 tommy really embodies the American way
Im gonna rewatched this 😢
Long journey boys ❤❤❤❤
damn
❤
I think the disc in Techno's chest was for Tommy, in some way. Almost as if it was Tommy's own little "note" left by Techno.
Never cried on stream huh? Seemed awfully close there. 👀
WOO DSMP IS FINALLY OVER YEEEHAWWWW
Thank you for everything that you and everyone has brought me. All of the funny streams, the funny bits, the sad ones too just thank you for being there when I wasn't feeling like myself.  I loved every single one of yours and the others streams as well, much love from America these have completely changed my life. ❤
10:19  ive watched them and ive always been a big fan. its been a long time since ive watched streams and this is
Dream SMP practically saved my life in COVID. I was fresh into middle school, and it seemed like everything would just end at any moment. Until I discovered these people and this server. I remember not being sure if I was able to watch the actual streams without a Twitch account, so I would wait for Tommy to upload a video on the lore, or I'd watch an uploaded recording of his streams. Tommy and Techno's arc will always be my favorite, even if The Blade is gone. And seeing Tommy re-visit the legend's house made me very emotional. I won't ever forget him or these past two years of my life that I spent alongside this server. Thank you so much for saving me and giving me a better look towards the future, and may we never forget. o7 ❤
Dang
This video made cry I thought of all the good times and how happy it’s made me, but all good things must come to an end
POV the dragon : It's my time 😐
2 years gone In a blink of an eye
lowkey cried seeing this i was here from the start rip techno blade
Wait, this is the last TommyInnit video ever, and not just his last video on the DreamSMP?
Im gonna miss this era of youtube
………………
The moment you killed a bee in front of Tubbo, I thought, oh no you messed up.
Long live the King ( R.I.P Technoblade he will never die )
I never even watched the dream SNP and I feel sad 😢
12:00 this is when real men cry
I REALLY LIKE IT :D :D
sobs
I loved this server and everything in it and I wad honestly crying after
Dream not dreams dang it my autocorrect  is going haywire sry
13:33 oh wow flash back. What was the noise though LMAO
rip such a great era
so sad that its ending and when you went to Techno's place omg its so sad and its almost a year since his passing as well
The fact that technoblade was the true main character
absolutely unreal
Wow... i-ah.... I guess that's it.
The End of an Era... thill next time.
“Don’t be sad that it’s gone be happy cause it happend”-Dr Seuss
Oh thank god
O7 Technoblade
Techno was watching down smiling and laughing that whole stream for all the amazing memories ❤
the techno section hit hard
I wasnt ready to cry 🙁
Thank you for all the memories, just everything. The Dream SMP was truly a wonderful thing. Had me tearing up at the end.     Thank you :)

Question. Where is the world download
*"Don't cry because it ended, Smile because it Happend."*

😢 what now what will now happen what is next what will come out of this nothing or will this come to something come out of this to create dream SMP chapter 2 or can this be the bigining of somthimg new and what we can love also rest in peace to TECHNOBLADE ❤
OMG ID DID NOT JUST RECOMMEND THE FIRST EVER VIDEO THAT TOMMY MADE. THE FIRST TIME HE JOINED THE SERVER OMG IM LITERALLY SHEDDING TEARS WTF 😭❤
Dream SMP, you will be missed.
Dream SMP was basically my comfort and happiness back during covid (2020-2021 mostly) and i remember the hype and the sleepless nights i spent watching the streams and lore. Those years were the worst for my mental health and health in general.  I was deeply in depression, my grades were dropping, i had no friends other than the one friend i completely shut out at the time. I was overweight and just a horrible mess but i don't want to remember those years as only that but also the years i joined a place i could be myself in. A place where nothing is expected of me and i didn't have to meet up to expectations, i didn't have to worry about my mental health draining, i could ignore all the problems i had and as long as I felt "happy" to be anywhere but the real world, it was enough for me.  It's been awhile since i stopped watching everyone, i grew out of it, moved on and so did they. I did tear up and smile throughout the video, it just felt too nostalgic and i just didn't have it in me to pretend to be stone faced and pretend it doesn't hurt in the slightest.  I hate change and endings, they always make me greatly sad but the fact that those memories will always remain as one of the best ones really help get through the thought. I wanna thank everyone from the Dream SMP and everyone on twitch, those people were amazing and it felt like i actually had some place i could call "home".
Thank god finally
Why was there no fundy though?
It's been such an adventure 🥲, thank you Tommy for all these laughs 😁😊🤓!
HUMMINA
Oh my god I thought it was fake... NOOOOOO!😭
Time to unsub 9:44 😕
To be honest the dream smp has been a huge part of my life and has built me over the years I enjoyed everyone and I had an unexplainable feeling when I saw an on going stream or why I see a new dream smp video posted it's been an honor for the hard work . I thank dream and everyone from the smp  because this will be in my memories forever and it's quite sad it's going to an end thank you dream ,Tommy and everyone else and TECHNOBLADE it's been an honor .Thankyou
This hits hard man, I remember sitting through covid, dreaming to be these guys, in the Dream SMP.
Dude we all are blessed to born in this era, the evolution of the gaming. And this Dream SMP, who would have thought before 2 and half years that we would be too connected with this SMP, the storylines, the characters, the jokes, the rage, and also the bloopers😂 but this was a masterpiece and I think no one could even recreate it like this in the future. But thank you Dream SMP, you have been always a key part in my life and I will never forget this.  The part where Tommy goes to Technoblade's House 11:00. It still hurts even after 9 months, I mean he is gone, but he still lies between us. TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
Techno Blade in heaven. "why are you stealing my stuff TOMMY, I WILL COME AFTER YOU IN HEAVEN!! Is the last thing I do". 100 years later in heaven. "COME HERE TOMMY"
lets all agree dream smp is not complete with out he legend technoblade
What's happend to techno base
Damn it hits hard when Tommy was looking through Techno's stuff
techno a king
RIP dream smp
i am crying right now but im happy the dream smp happend
The dream SMP was just amazing. I feel soo sad that its ending. o7
no way u used the same music schlatt used to kill the ender dragon in smp live
I'm gonna miss this.
it's upsetting, but the community has given up
tommy can you pleeeeeeease try to play five nigths at freddys I love your vids btw 💗♥♥
This evokes such a bittersweet feeling, I'm going to miss dsmp
Dsmp fam was an amazing thing, may the memories be shine ❤
Memories ill look back on one day and maybe share it with my kids or grand kids dsmp taught me so much  and ofc techno was in it too making it 100x better o7s kings and queens see you on the other side - albert
07
im not crying you're crying
im not crying you're crying
Technoblade is like the foundation of dream smp when he passed away so do dream smp. good bye dream smp we will miss everything.
Dream SMP the best smp ever
I litrealy almost cried watching the end, I am really proud of my self just like you Tommy even if I didn't watch your stream even if I was not a complete part of your community your charity... No kidding man... It is quite sad, this genualy reminded of my childhood like... When I was a child no one wanted to be my friend like no kidding no one, Then I just found the thing I was waiting for friends like just it just felt amazing like how some one was like " Hey, wanna be my friend? " like SHIT... It was my first step on friendship, but it didn't  lasted for too long just like that I had a lung infection called Pneumonia I had to stay in hospital for like 2 or 3 months like it felt like a prison for my soul in its own body, after I recovered I had social anxiety... I changed the place I used to live and started my new life... I might be like 9 or 8 when I first found Dream SMP like first I was like " These people do use bad words but they look nice. " then I started watching Dream SMP every single day of my life I learned more and more I met new people like for a bit it felt like my social anxiety was just gone WOSH away with in the air... Dream SMP was truly amazing it changed my life like I ent from a scared cat to a free bird living its life in freedom... Thank you so much good bye L'Manburg, Pogtopia, Eggtopia every single bit of the Dream SMP you all have changed my life and again... Thank you...
Don't be sad that it's ended, just be happy that it began
cant believe this started 2 years ago... what an amazing journey.
Don’t care
o7
Glad that I didn't even care about this server at all since ever, the lore's stinks.  Heheh, aku malas nak taip dah. Edit: aku tgk vid ni 3 hari lps upload, aku tak tahu pun kalau dah upload sekalipun.
This is one of the saddest endings I've ever seen I'm gonna miss the dream SMP vids
If there Ever comes the Day when someone brings this world back alive with every single of these Best lovely People then ill be 100% f*cking sure To be there and shout "f*ck yeah!" from the top of my lungs. ❤
I thought I wasn’t gonna cry but looks like I remembered many memories and I burst out it’s sad that technoblade wasn’t there to watch the finale😢
WAIIIIITTT DOES THIS MEAN THAT YOURE NEVER GONNA STREAM AGAIN!!!!!!!?????? OR IT MEANT SOMETHING ELSE???
all seriousness aside, the switch of tommy's expression from confusion to realization is sending me😭 6:24
was at my lowest before I discovered dream smp and these people made me realize theres at least something that could genuinely make me full of joy and it's this server, the people, and just generally their interactions. they truly helped me get back on my feet. it's bittersweet to see it come to an end but I feel honored to have witnessed everything go down :)
This server is a massive part of me, this server took 2 years of my life and I loved it watching everyone's posts about this server, the lore, the crossover, everything, I loved it, I always remember me watching this after doing my school works it hits so hard to see Tommy post his last video on the server, I expect that this will happen one time or another but I didn't expect this to happen now or should I say days before, goodluck to everyone who watched this with me, may we succeed in everything that we wanted to do   -Love s_ad  Edit: typo
Seeing a thing that got me and my best friend together now end... The thing that made me happy when i was sad.  Thank you all for this
The fact that Tommy got emotional by visiting techno's place hit me hard.
This video make me cry it's 2023 but I'm still watching you guy's goodbye dream smp
i dont cry watching videos. i just cried watching a video
Wow man…I can’t even explain how much this server and all of the people in it ment to me, and as I continue in the community and the creators lives I can’t express how much love I still have to give for them all, one last o7 for the dsmp boys
So many memories
Bro im gonna cry.. The dream smp was truly the most iconic smp of them all. RIP DREAM SMP!.
The dream amp was amazing incredible SPECTACULAR so it was hard for me and my brother see it go..
i never watched dsmp. i always heard about dream and tommy and tubbo and phil and ranboo and the others, the minecrafters taking the world by storm. and i always thought 'yeah, maybe later', and how wrong i was. i nearly cried watching this. ive missed a lot, but i wish the very best for everyone and hopefully ill be there for other things in the future. o7 <333

props to tommy for promoting technos merch while in emotion, its exactly what techno would've wanted
DREAM=GAY
That was so emotional, who will sign a petition with me to turn the dsmp into a movie

Dream sounds so different in this final vid lol
Thi thi this is the last it's gone
This was genuinely so emotional, even though I sort of left the fandom and everything surrounding it the Dream SMP still was what got me through the tough times of covid and I will be forever grateful for that. Thank you for that, you helped so many people to relax and find comfort in those times of distress, you and all the other members of the SMP and the SMP will be remembered as a pivotal point in internet history, I'm sure. Thank you for the laughs, the smiles, the memories, the stories, it has been an honor watching and joining you on this journey and although some things may end, this is still just the beginning of your career and I look forward to watching you continue to grow and make content. Thanks for everything Tommy, and to everyone else from the dream SMP, especially Techno o7
I started crying as I watched that sunset..it's all to an end now..
o7
Tommy is nearly crying when he goes to technos house this smokes means so much to him and everyone else I was in year 6 when I remember this I’m now year 9
It is sad so sad that you are you going to miss your friends in Dream smp sorry we are going to miss them :(  :(  :(
dream smp was cool, sucks the fanbase got kinda weird after a certain point. Technoblade was who I watched it through, Tommy I watched the cut up edited vods through. Thanks Tommy for the vids.  Technoblade never dies folks.
Really, this feels like such a big part in my life. When I found you out I couldn’t stop watching, it’s like I don’t recognize this anymore, it’s so hard to let go I feel like somthing stabbed my heart and then toook it out, 07.
dam
Tommy I love watching you on dream amp I'm going to miss this😢😢
To see Tommy shed a tear for the king himself, he visited one last time for all of us, and he even promoted his merch store while in techno's old home. Much respect. o7
Thank you
as someone who has been here since late 2020, this video hit me hard and the fact that its been almost 3 years of being in this community ):
This hurt 😭 actually make me think techno is actually gone wow iv never been so hurt by a YouTube video before 😅
i lost it when he went to technos. after that i could not stop crying
What was the music disc at the end called I forgot
Fuck man....... this is hitting hard i feel a  sensation  like a tingle on my hands and heart    thanks dsmp ,rip techno he never dies...
bro i needed how to sex
Totally not crying- o7 been around since the elections, not as long as everyone else but a while, love you guys and this community sm
It made me cry when I saw techno's home one last time😢. Thank you Tommy for this is made me feel a lot better
How do you get Midas in fortnite
I really wish technoblade was here for this.
Tommy... thank you for this vid... it really reminded me of tecnoblade... I REALLY miss everyone from the past and now smp... thank you so so much...
It’s sad that Technoblade didn’t defeat the ender dragon Like the others in the dream SMP😢
e
wait does this technically mean he’s quitting even though he said he isn’t
"I don't remember spawn being so *gay."*
Man fuck this just hits different i really got to like technos videos and he got me through covid and a lot of sad moments FUCK man this shit sucks i wish techno was still 😢😭
2:read how to do se- OK
Congrats on 13M Subs ❤🙂
can't believe it's over
No tommy thank YOU for everything.
o7
the dsmp was literally the only thing keeping me going for a while. After bad friendships conversations or breakups i knew i could always come back to everyone’s streams, especially summer 2021.
I spent 1/6th of my life on this SMP. I may be sad that it ended. But happy that it was once here…
One thing I've noticed in Tommy's videos and all of The Dsmp videos is that tommy is growing up and I found that's why where attached to them, Tommy is indeed a mc for one hell of a slice of life story lol But not just him. Everyone is growing in there own right They've completely Changed and Evan though it hurts a little they helped us too. To the laughs,Tears,and Story this chapter will end once and for all.
Finally
I’m going to miss all of this so much, but thank you for everything! ♥️
he stole from a dead person cause he stole from technos house
Bro i literally watch this before i want to school i literally cried the whole session
o7
The video that pops up when it is about to end is the first video. In gives us a reminder that even though the server may be over, our memories will be forever. Thanks for being a part of our life.
Dream SMP was a mess to begin with, so I think its a good thing ya'll moved on from it.
Please make a dream smp 2 please
tommy bans everyone "IM THE VICTIM!!"
Are you still gonna post on Tom simons?
15:49 Tommyinnit: "IM GETTING TOUCHED!!!" Me: "In what context do you mean by that?"
I think we will all miss the dream SMP Like if think this to
Definitely hard to see Techno’s house again after all this time. The legend brightened so many lives and definitely made a positive impact on everyone in the server and the community. Thanks to Techno and everyone for making something so great.
Everyday feels like a last day with uncle nasty in the world doesnt it tommy
This is where Tommy's profile picture came from. (Sry to break the seriousness, but the SMP rlly did influence me by a whole lot)
Dream smp was such an important era in my life. This was so heartwarming/heartbreaking to watch :')
I started tearing up when he went to technos😕
I wish that the fandom for this server wasn't so young and immature, so that more people would see how fun and creative this server has been. Thanks for the streams, videos and all the memories you guys made long the way. Thank you Tommy.
Hello tommy! It's me! @craftee2203minecraft
Thank you for making my ears bleed at 4:04 😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😅😅😅😅😅  Edit: I'm much more mature now I feel the pain
☹️
I almost cried while watching this but one thing on the good side we have the ✨QSMP✨                  still gonna cry
Thanks for the 2 almost the 3 years with this tommy you made me who I am today ❤❤ And the reason I meet this server was Teachnoblade. Thanks see you in the streams
I haven't watched any DSMP stuff in at least a year, but I'm watching this. I was watching when we first saw it, so it's only fitting I see its end. o7
It hurts me seeing the house of thechoblade but It was so many good memorisss :)
Techno was the one to defeat the dragon with the spirit he left behind
man this is so nostalgic already
Thank you to the Dream SMP, so many memories, so many good times, and it is so sad to see it go.  Thank you Dream SMP.
monumental. so glad i was here for the whole journey.
Tommy is still trash at MLG's even after 2 years
That was awesome, Tommy. We're proud of your growth and the dream smp will forever be in our hearts as much as it is in yours
I know it's the last time they play on dsmp, but so much effort to press disconnect like OMG it's not that hard
Dream SMP will be missed o7
Don’t stop doing dream SMP videos my favorite YouTuber
i wanna take a moment to thank everyone in the dsmp for the time during covid when i found it, they helped me through so much i cant even explain it, i was in a very dark place and i never spoke to anyone about it and watching tommys, tubbos, ranboo's and wilburs streams always made me feel better, whenever i needed a pick me up or js a laugh i would go and watch their streams o vods or js random bits that tommy made. they honestly saved my life in so many ways than they know, its emotional fo rme to even think that there wont be anymore dsmp streams where tom causes chaos and kills anyone and everyone, these people have really made such a diffrence in my life and ill never forget the night i was at my lowest and about to end it all and tommy went live, that night he saved me and for that, him and his streams will hold a very special place in my heart, he doest know me but i feel like he was my only real friend i had, its stupid ik but he was the only person who could make me laugh and when my best friend passed away last year his streams and vlogs made me feel so much better and for that  i wanna say thank you Tom, for everything, you mean the world to me.
0:00 first in timed beta
The DreamSMP touched millions including myself. At the height of COVID when everyone was down, there was always this server and all those that were on it to lift us up. It gave people joy and consistency in a time of uncertainty, and I couldn't be more thankful. O7 to you all, and here's to the future.
o7
Respect for the prime log 🌲
I'm crying rn cause the dream smp was the thing what got me through covid and for that 2 years I was happy watching every stream of the dream smp from everyone. Goodbye Dream smp
i cried so many times
o7
Tommy... u shouldn't steal from a dead man
When I saw the title of this video I was already slowly tearing up I’ve been watching dream amp since the beginning and when they took the group photo and when tommy visited technos house I cried so hard I couldn’t breath especially when they were fighting the enderdragon fly bough techno
Dream sounds weird
A story to be told, ankles were rolled tough its the end we shall accept what happened it was a great battle, there were nice ones and bad ones, Lost a man behind, still in our hearts and mind, we had peaceful times, we also had bad times, we planned strategies we made melodies, now be gone the greatness of an era hope for a new story, a story to be told we love you deep in our heart we shall remember the great war art, technoblade we miss you so much were sorry you didnt get to experience this moment, explored the whole world is where we went, tried to protect our country, failed as the enemies were far beyond greatness some wars were won some were lost but even if we have some fears "We have to persevere" - dream
Bro the dream sup helped me through 2020-2021. Im sad to see it go but im happy that everyone else can make more cooler stuff now
“Don’t cry because it’s over. Be happy that it happened.”    (Idk if I got the quote right but you get it.)
The dream SMP is forever in our heart and will be missed I never used to watch tecnoblade and I still don’t be he reminds me of courage and joy
the end of an era <33
Thank you for alot of great childhood memories goodbye Dream SMP❤
I’m gonna be honest I did find tommy annoying at first now I love his vids
why do they actually have to stop the dsmp
This is random but my friend came out as trans and I fucking said “That’s so pog”  tommy wtf have u done to me Update: my friend responded and they said poggies
o7

He swears just at the time my mom walks in me 😐
It was never meant to be
The best moment was when he was in technos house😢
Are you gonna make more videos?
;(
This video make me realize what an Absolute internet gargantuan it is, especially considering i've never watched any of the streams and somehow know some of the lore from some goofy ahh kid on twitter
💜💜💜
I cried
Very good video Tom
I couldn't help but tear up when Tommy went to technos house
Rip technoblade
:'D I'll miss this!why did it have to end bro?
and when tommy visited TECHNOBLADE house he was going to almost cry but started to joke it off
Rip techno rest in piece king
when we think about time really flies
W.O.W
:(
Remake another server..
It was a wonderful time. I personally didn`t watched any livestreams about he smp but I got invested in the lore and the characters. Here I heard for the first time of wilbur ,tommy and techno I will never forget this smp. Good bye everyone and maybe see you next time.
i almost cried when you said this please don't go and leave this PLS :(
dam that is it for dream smp
This legit made me cry 😢
I Hope you had fun tommy ❤ I’ll miss your streams on the server
TOMMY IM GONNA CRY
mad to think this used to be such a big part of my life and now its just not
All good times come to an end..but this one I'd hope I didn't..
We will never forget Dream SMP❤
If only technoblade was here for the finale❤
The last disconnect.
I never thought I'd cry over a video, but here I am. the DSMP was such a huge part of my life and these people kept me going for years, gave me something to look forward to, something to connect me to the greatest community ever. What a rollercoaster of a ride it was, and I'm so grateful to have been a part of this world. I'm happy that they get to begin a new chapter of their lives, and I'm happy to have met all of you. Tommy, you are such an inspiration to everyone. What you've done, who you are, and what you will accomplish is amazing.   Love you all.  And we can't forget...  Technoblade Never Dies.
thank you dream smp.
looking back its been 2 whole years ut was one heck of a ride i still re watch techno's dsmp vods i was litterally crying when he walked into technoblades house i din't even cry when some 1 i knew died o7
I started watching dream smp when it was quarantine  it helped me develop a lot of things and it made a positive impact on me. all i have to say is its been an honor to be a part of this fandom and dream smp will always have a special place in my heart
Technoblade never dies
i dont understand why they shut down the server
:)
Please make a new server
Am crying😅
❤❤❤❤
im crying right now why did it have to end like this😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
So much nostalgia. Tommyinnit is an absolute legend for making this server so special. POGGERS!
This made me cry at the end :(((
o7
Is this the vid of tommy in dsmp or his last vid forever
Only legends noticed the spacebar sound at the end
even though i stopped watching the dream smp at one point, this had me nostalgic, flashbacks got me back to the good days of covid. i wish i could re watch all that with the same emotions. thank you tommy
Thanks for the memories o7
Loved being a part of this journey
Who cried?
tommy's and every youtuber's stream in this server will be missed forever. Thankyou for giving us the best time during covid! o7
I'm gonna fucking cry why Tommyyyyyyy
I’m not gonna lie .. this server ALL the members had SO many memories. I can’t believe this was the last server Technoblade played in. But as they all say Technoblade never dies for the last time. Thank you Tommyinnit for twitch streaming most of you time on the dream SMP for us.
To bad there's no technoblade
you’re not QUITTING quitting right?
The way Tommy looks at the camera before he jumps into the portal is epic
The end of an era
"dont be sad that it ended, be happy that it happend"  - idk who 😅
imagine crying over a video game, couldn't be me. man, i will miss this smp for my entire life.  RIP Technoblade o7.
😢
Didn't think that I would cry watching this, but the little smile while you were jumping into the portal made me tear up and the ending - tears had to happen. I love what you did with this server and I love all of you guys, thank you for some of the best memories from my life ❤
😢
Brought back memories 🥲   You will always be a part of my childhood ❤
All good things must come to an end :’)
o7
Wait is this tommyinits last video
this server has saved a lot of people and i glad i found out about it and the people that were on it. dont be sad it ended be happy that it happened o7 boys.
2 years went so fast.
I apologize to inform you but. no man shall know the day or the hour when he returns. I will fight for him in any media platform I am on from now on.
“Last 2 years of my life has come to an end” You can just further decrease that quote to be more and more out of context…
I prayed for technoblade to be saved once I heard the news he was passing away. I prayed and prayed God saved him.
I cried when he went to Techno's house:(((
temporarily banning dream was my idea too 😎
Does this mean he is quitting YouTube..?
:'(((((
o7
Thanks to everyone who was apart of the Dsmp, it filled me with a lot of joy and this video made me cry multiple times, I wish the best for everyone and I love you Tommy 🫶
God, me very me
I never thou thought about it but tubbo’s skin looks like tweek from South Park
“Its as much for you guys as it is for me” thank you tommy but its not no matter how much we as his fans may have adored him you were his actual friend we’ll never understand
Im a new Tommy Dream sapnap George fan but i still began crying
That’s so sad😢
Which video is this
glad I can I say I was apart of it, this fandom is held dearly to my heart and all the fun memories i had when I was going through so many changing moments in my life something nice to look back at. Thank you for being apart of something truly incredible <3 :’)
o7
the way he said “i never got to meet dave” was so sad I’ll miss this for everything that it was and everything that it did for me, but its time ro grow up and start a new adventure.       o7

One last time😢

My heart , Dsmp changed my life and having inspired by you guys and I will never forget the good memories of this
Im 😢
Good memories ❤😊
They should've killed the warden and the wither
3 years ago and until now I would never think that this community will brighten my day every single time i watch them. Thank you for those unforgetful moments of joy and sadness
Dream SMP has made me get to where I am today. It has had SUCH a big part of my life. In fact, I probably would’ve never started my channel without it. I am so thankful for it being in my life, it had gotten me through the good and bad, and cheered me up when I was down. There was so much nostalgia watching this video, and I nearly cried seeing Tommy visit Techno’s base. The Dream SMP will always and forever hold a special place in my heart. RIP Technoblade and the DSMP  Edit: Also I do not regret animating Tommy’s failed MLG that was hilarious I swear to god lol
RIP TECHNO 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
very fair and not chaotic dragon fight you had  also you rebirthed my sadness of techno but still I thank you for that moment
I very thankful for everyone that play on the Dreamsmp and hope everyone has a good life
Stop u can't do this to me feelings whyyy I'm crying and laughing at the same time 😭😭😭07     I... I'll miss you.. Dream smp...
If I come back here at let's say 5 years from now, i'd probably cry because this is too nostalgic. Hello future me😄
this pains me to see it go o7 man
Noooo😢😢
o7
I literally watched this while doing my homework, would do again
Technoblade be like: tommy,.......tommy...WHY DID YOU OPENED MY SECRET BARREL??? TOMMY STOP STEALING STUFF FROM MY CHEST!! Later in the end fight; techno be like: bruhhh after so years they finally decided to kill the dragon WITHOUT ME!   Also where was ranboo? I didn't see him
❤
I want to say something meaningful like the rest of the comments but my mind is blank, i just can't believe it's come to an end. So i guess, this is goodbye huh. The only thing i regret is not having discovered this universe sooner.
Screaming, crying, throwing up because I MISSED THIS STREAM JAHQGXJQEC  I'm not sobbing, you're sobbing
Thats it boys. Thats the end :)
o7
I loved every thing about Dream SMP, hate to see it end here but oh well.. RIP Techno, I wish he was there to fight the end with the rest together
tommy is gay
E
So long DSMP! It’s been a blast. With that said, one last time guys?  I heard there was a special place…
I cried
I actually cried right now only because hes not going to do dream smp videos.
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
This was just PERFECT, it's sad to see it go but I'll remember all the great memories, thanks for playing a big role in the Dream SMP Tommy!
Tommy why did you end it?
All great things must come to an end, but a new great thing would start. The Dream SMP was one of the most best things that happened in my life.
I wasn't planning on crying today but when he went to techno's house I just lost it
Last time all memories back and gone forever
Bro u this smp change me ilove this smp good bye
Is this real or am i dreaming i was crying so fking hard ill miss the dream smp videos 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The Dream SMP was such an inspiration to all, The Lore, The fun times and the bad times, this SMP has inspired so many as well as myself to work towards their goals and be who they are, I am so grateful for this server, thank you Tommy, Dream, BBH, Techno, and everyone for the amazing content, we will miss this epic server and it’s awesome community
the dream smp changed my life, made it better, everyone thank you. i loved and enjoyed every moment of it.  technoblade will forever be missed.
the part where he goes to technos place made me cry god it just feels so weird you could hear the pain in tommys voice to...🙁☹

It mad me sadder seeing your first dsmp video at the end
I almost cried bro

Thank you for all the memories, Dream SMP changed my life over the past two years. o7
Nothing Like the Dream SMP
Since I have found the DSMP I smile whenever I watch it  I loved DSMP and I'm happy that it happened❤
Although i didnt watch a lot of dream smp i feel sad...
I’m an idiot so I have to ask. does this video mean TommyInnit is quitting YouTube? Or just dream smp
A epic ending for the epic server
End of a era
the dragon fight was funny but not much because techno wasn't here will miss him
as soon as he went in techno's house i instantly teared up. rip techno and rip dream smp
Ibub
You were stop making videos 😭
I watched this live and I'm still crying 😢 the dream smp was such a big part of my life for the past 2 years it will be missed
Finally, a story to tell ny grandkids...
I remember finding Tommy's vod channel right when he started streaming DSMP. I've never been more thankful that my attention span was more than 5 minutes
I remember the time when all the dream smp players were still very active... it's sad. as the years pass...the dream smp will only be a happy memory. it became part of my childhood❤❤❤❤
😔
never cried harder 😭👍
The Techno part was the best I felt so happy and sad all at once.
I fucking cried
Truly the end of an era. I definitely enjoyed my stay o7
i swear this made me cry 😭
PLEASE TELL ME YOUR JOKING I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS SO MUCH😢
im not a fan anymore of dream smp or really streamers at all but im still watching because like last stream??? yeah sure, why not. thank you for the technoblade dedication, he meant a lot to everyone, new and old or even divorced fans
Siuuu
watched this at 111k likes, a new journey of self is on the horizon.
W
Loved it
Season 2
Wtf
good riddance
I always disliked this thing to a degree, and as rude and uncalled for this is, I am glad it is over.
Thank you DSMP!
Hi Tommy! I was wondering if you were able to get in contact with Ranboo. I need you to ask him for advice for a gift for my friend. She’s a dream smp nerd and she loves Ranboo and all the characters. But she loves Ranboo more than all of them. No offense. But all think u Tubbo and Ranboo and captain puffy are the best. Ok but back to the point . I really want to do something special for my friend. I don’t know what to do. If there’s a thing that Ranboo could do to make a gift special for her then that would be great. Thank you and hopefully you see this and read it and possibly make a video. Oh and ps you’re one of the best YouTubers ever. Thanks bye
beautiful...
i'm going to write a book about the dream smp so i can read it to my kids when i get older
o7
The end gave me hella chills goodbye dreamsmp
Rip dream smp 😮
Goodbye. Let’s get o7’s in the replies. o7 to everyone on the server, the memories, the content. o7 to Technoblade and all the others. o7 to the Dream SMP.
i dont have time to express my emotions. I ssuck at communicating how i feel, but you sharing your life for two years, outside lore, even just you chilling with your mates, phil, tubbo, techno, will, everyone. It feels like the end of an era. i wish techno was here for the end. you just being yourself, with everyone else, has made so many people happy. nothing like this will happen again. I wish it would, but it would mean less the second time. good luck tommy. you deserve it.
why is it the last time
RIP Tommy's place in the server and the King
its been months since I watched a one of these dream smp videos and sad to see it ending i rember i used to watch this since it starde the 1 day and with techno gone its sad and damn this type of videos were my fav fr🥲
Didnt know the end of the dream smp is the day l started my own <3(the dsmp has changed my life)
So grateful for you the dream Smp and everyone on it but I’m kinda glad it’s over because it makes room for a new era and I’m exited
Rip dream SMP.
I was there for the beginning, and I'm happy to be here for the end. Everything has to end unfortunately. It was great while it lasted tho, and was a wild ride! Thank you to everyone on the DSMP for making those 2.5 years amazing! ❤
the end of an era. thank you, for everything
Dreams voice has changed a lot throughout this smp. I’m really gonna miss it but it was an amazing series and I hope another smp will start up!
I’m glad that this was the end, but also not, I cried at some memories but that’s fine. All this work was great and amazing, I’m so glad that I was able to experience this at the beginning to the end. Thank you tommy and all of the rest of the dream SMP members. You all made me laugh and smile. I love you all platonically.

We will forever support you all as creators, even as the DSMP comes to its end.  From: The whole community <3
This made me cry😢
Wow
ok so who's gonna be the one to start a petition to get Sad-ist to animate this?
Im crying.
i joined the dream smp community 2 years ago and haven't regretted a single minute. i do wish i joined during the early days of l'manburg but i'm glad i got to experience this journey. many people had judged me for liking this server but i loved it because i meet so many great content creators because of it. it's hard to believe this is the final stream but it is. i'm so excited to see other future smp's but i will always remember the dream smp. i will cheerish these memories for the rest of my life, especially the ones with technoblade. thanks for everything dream smp!!!
3/4 through the video,tommy actually is getting a bit emotional.
I already have a bad mental health and it just makes it worse but if you feel comfortable with it then I'm happy for u . this smp Gave me the best years of my life and it will continue to make it better and better. With love,your biggest fan❤❤
JUST TELL ME you're joking right. RIGHT!!
Thank you, Tommy, and everyone, for the happiest years of my life.
aww 😭😭😭😭😭🙁🙁🙁😥😥
End of a era! To think it’s all coming to end feels so unrealistic. I thank you Tommy and all of the Dreamsmp members for putting a smile on my face countless times and making life a little easier. For Techno who is no longer with us, thank you for the endless smiles and chaotic memories. Technoblade never dies!! Thank you Tommy. Thank you.
DSMP ran from the end of my freshmen year to me now in my senior year… wild to think about

This server, this Dream SMP has played a significant part in my life for 2 and a half years and even then I've still got a long way to go as a 14 year old now, I genuinely just feel relieved and grateful at the thought that you and I were one of the many viewers who witnessed this server and its content creators grow and progress through all the fun and joy, sadness and hardship and that's not even mentioning the fanbase, they played a major role too in making the server what it was.  And yes, I mean YOU the person who is reading this now. It's the memories we've had that are directly related to this server and community and I will treasure it for a lifetime and as should you dear reader.  so, tell me... what were your memories here?
The fact that technoblade wasn't in that photo hurts my soul
Didn't think id be crying over a dream smp video in 2023 but this really got me. This server and all the creators who made it special really kept me going through covid and I'm so grateful for that. Thanks for everything Tom :)
tommy: “it’s my sh*thole” me:🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
Is there still gonna be season 2?
The was the most whip lash I have ever felt emotionally in a tommyinnit video.  Close to crying -> mlg
😢
Its so sad seeing my happiness end..Thanks for the memories DSMP!
you guys were such an integral part of my quarantine <3 and an integral part of my life. im a different person because of you all, i have different interests. i streamed because of you, ran my own mc server, i  made a discord server. aaaah im going to miss it so much. thank you beautiful people. thank you for making me who i am today :)
Such a shame techno wasnt around for the finale :,(
Techno’s home hit me hard
Finally 🎉🎉🎉
All the dream smp was in the picture, accept one person 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 rip techno
2:45 Bottom text 🤣
Rip the blade
Tommy wassup I see you chillin with your ass chin(i mean double chin though it's the same thing)
Thank you sm for everything dsmp, and u, tommy. Technoblade never dies. xoxo, much love. Goodbye Dream Smp. We'll miss you. Always and Forever. <3
i’m not crying you are
I used to watch dream smp abit but I have not watched in ages I saw this video sp thought I had to watch let me tell u I’m in tears I never realised how much I used to love it and how much it had impacted my life in a positive way so ty <3
sad thats its dying
The TECHNOBLADE part was my favorite here
The amont of fanart that is gonna get made from them killing the enderdragon will be insane
even being late to the fandom and only really watching the finale streams, this still hits hard. Dream SMP was a big part of all of our lives, and I’m so grateful for it.  Thank you for everything
It seems like dream sounds different
Who could've thought that a server in a game made of pixels can be that emotional, I am glad I witnessed these memories from the the start of the server till the end of it.
Rip techno and the dsmp
why am i sobbing
The last we will ever see of dsmp
Aw may 2020 is when I found DSMP I’m 19 now :(  , I miss 2020 era so much. Everyone streams always got my mind off of the things I was going through the pass years knowing them❤ I’m not really a big fan of them now but I still keep up with some of the stuff they do. This era has come to a end.
im not ok
o7
Looking back on the Dream SMP I realized that the way I experienced the story is special. I followed different people at different points and maybe one day I’ll see every pov of this server…  I started off watching Wilbur, then Tommy, Technoblade, and lastly Quackity.  I lost interest after the news that Techno passed. Sometimes it doesn’t feel real and I know I didn’t know him personally but I do find it really touching that he was able to impact so many people in such a profound way. I’m sad he didn’t get to continue writing more stories I’m sure they would’ve been just as memorable.  I kept up with major plot points but it didn’t hit the same. I remember being so excited when animatics would drop and people would post little snippets of streams. I just find it a bit sad I guess. This era was something I enjoyed and perhaps I’ll come back to it but I really think it’s time to say goodbye. Maybe I’ll finish that slide show I made. Who knows?
This lowkey hurt to watch. I'll miss it.
NO………
This just in: Tommy is a grave robber.
🫡
WHY THIS GOT TO BE THE LAST  I FEEL SO EMOTIONAL  well nothing good ever lasts forever
The DSMP got me through some stuff and I’m so so sad to see it go but I love the memories that were made
bruuuuuuuh
Genuinely can't explain how much of my personality and friends came from this server. You guys just messing around in some video game and having fun, inspiring so many other people to want to do the same. We all truly can't explain how grateful we are for you guys, and were so happy you guys now have such a successful living style. Offtopic, looking forward to possibly seeing any of you guys at vidcon, and o7 the blood god, Techno.
so... thanks for all o7
not as big of a fan of the dream smp, but it made me so sad to see technos base. Rip
Just killed a woman feeling good.
oh my god IM CRYING SO HARD
This was a big part of my childhood and I am truly grateful for it. Although it's difficult saying goodbye, this is also the perfect resolution to it. I loved the Dream SMP. So much. And I will miss it so much.   Goodbye Dream SMP. TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES! <3
And just like that....the thing that kept me going through COVID was over. The few smiles, laughs, screams I had during that time? It all started here. All good things must come to an end, they say, but it leaves room for new good things to appear. Goodbye DreamSMP.
Tommy, you always make great content. This was a great close to the SMP!
“IM THE MAIN CHARACTER I KNOW IT YOU KNOW IT”   I won’t even lie, he has every right to say that. He’s the (in my opinion) only one who makes things interesting on the server. He’s got quirks that are perfect for a story, charismatic, and never gave up the whole time. He’s honestly the only reason I watched the smp lol. Dream made the server but he was just part of it. Tommy was just more human than the rest of the characters in the smp.   Obviously, all the characters in this are pretty interesting and have their own unique style, but Tommyinnit kept the storyline going.   I’m obviously over analyzing a small portion but I like to discuss stuff like this.
WHY IS DREAM VOISE SO DEEP
I watched the stream I watched the YouTube video… I’m still crying 😔  Every good thing must come to an end eventually 🤍 One last sunset on the best 2 years of our lives!
This will be a forever moment to remember <3❤❤ :( wish techno was here to see it end..
Going through Covid ans watching every single Dream SMP stream/video changed me. When he went over to Technoblades house I was brought to tears. The memories of this server are sweet and out of respect o7 I practically grew up a little from this server. I was in 8th grade and now I'm gonna be a Junior in highschool. Time flies by too fast for all of us. (I know two 1/2 years inst much but it was a lot for me). o7
squeaky child moment
Time sure does fly, Feels like it was just yesterday Technoblade was acting like a human GPS for Tommy. o7
thank you tommy this video brought back so many memories low key made me cry even tho that’s not allowed lmao. kinda sad to see dream smp go. love everyone on that server ❤
Tommy, I never thought you could make me cry on this channel, but now I have cried over 2 videos: Tribute To The Dream SMP and this video.
I miss technoblade
“Don’t cry because it’s gone, smile because it happened”  -A wise person
We gonna talk about that bucket list though?
o7
I don't believe it's been 2 years... wow...  This is such a wholesome end and the editing made me cry 😭
it's so sad and heartwarming
Finally that shit was ass
Can't believe it's over. Almost 3 years watching you all grow up, gain subscribers, and blowing up almost everything you can see has been awesome. Memories of techno and just seeing tommy go through his things brought tears to my eyes, glad to see you doing better  his passing. I'm sure that's what he would've wanted. Wish you all well. RIP techno ❤❤
You all were great at what you did! You made a lot of people including myself happy, and you made them all laugh… Goodbye to Dream SMP! And no there are no tear drops on my keyboard that’s just water   PS Techno you will always be missed
Not gonna lie dream SMP has changed my life and this is the final goodbye but you can still rewatch the old times.. and I hope there is a season two coming!😔💔
this server meant so much to me, o7❤️‍🩹
glad to see withers in the finale o7
I will forever remember the sever and everyone in it. It’s so weird thinking about how fast time flew by. 2 years later and I still remember everything that happened in the sever. During Covid this was my source of entertainment and it made me have something to look forward to everyday. Thank you for everything it’s crazy that it’s finally ending. Thank you for all the memories, the laughs, and just pure happiness you gave me. I will forever be grateful to the DSMP and will remember this sever for the rest of my life. Again thank you and Goodbye Dream SMP❤
I can't believe I used to watch this. This is dogshit
Goodbye Dream SMP youll be mist same to Technoblade
Tommy 2023: just killed a gogy, feeling good :D
Lovely
8:43 he did dream dirty
Damn.
Me thinking I could achieve my goal on joining the Dream SMP, but this video says otherwise.
It's funny when the video ended the next one recommended on the screen was "i joined dreams server and now he hates me"  Sad to see DSMP go, but it was a good time and definitely has done many good things in my life too as i was only a viewer o7
I watched the dream smp  like everyday I'm so sad its not going to be a thing anymore but it was nice
There should be a community version of the DREAM SMP
With every end comes a new begining. Who knows what happens next we will just have to wait and see…
The SMP changed my life during the pandemic and had such a great time while watching your video's that were on the SMP, Very sad to see it go but every good thing comes to an end
at 2:44: there is a "bottom text" in the subtitles
I'm aware that I didn't get to experience the dream smp moments, and that I haven't been there the whole time but it makes me sad to know that something apart of the channel is gone, but it's also great that everyone hot to make memories we won't forget  And sometimes it's better to let something go to grow Also I wish techno could had been there, but it'd happy to know he gets to watch from above :) (rest in peace techno <3 )  And also Tommy, thank you for always making my crappy days better and making me laugh always And all of your fans are here to always support you :) Peace out ✌️  Ps, "Just killed a woman feeling good"
Bro I litterly cryed
Rip dream smp😊
Thank you so much for all the memories and laughs, Tommy. I'm so unbelievably grateful for this server and this community, because those past two years I spent in this fandom were the best years of my life :')
This server genuinely changed my life. Despite joining in 2021, it helped me through so much, and I am forever grateful for that. The DSMP will always hold a special place in my heart, thank you ♥
damn. My goddamn cousin got me into this and it changed my whole life. Not even joking. I loved this. O7, truly. I was here <//3
Man.
The good ending.
The dsmp helped be get through hard times, I am truly grateful for the many many content creators that worked hard to help build it up. I will forever miss the dsmp..I am thankful that it helped me and I am thankful that I got into the dsmp, people might have hated it but many people loved and supported it all way to the end. With 3 years of content and building up popularity, I’d say it was truly a big success.
Didn't think i'd be hit so hard watching this video, the memories and all of it just meant a lot. I could write paragraphs and paragraphs about the impact of this server on me, but I think its a lot more impactful to keep it short and sweet.  Thanks for everything o7
i cried so hard and laughed so hard watching this because this entire server built up my childhood, and thousands of others, especially with techno gone (technoblade never dies) i just couldent watch this without spending two hours watching techno blade and tommyinnit was the most i watched. Dream SMP and Technonlade will never be forgotten 😮‍💨😌😔
The fact that the first dsmp video popped up after this one ended..
I can thank this server for so much, this server made the last 2 years so much more bearable
o7 Techno. Fly high king ❤❤❤
I’ll miss this so much 😭
This made me freaking cry man🥺❤️
f in chat for everything
the ending of the dsmp really changed the fanbase huh ☠
Let’s gooo!!! 🎉
This it’s so hard I couldn’t watch the streams but it was apart of me
Goodbye all the hours of my life watching these incredible videos. No regrets.
My favourite part was when Wilbur said “what are we, some kind of dream SMP” brought tears to my eyes man
THE LINK TO HIS FIRST DSMP VIDEO AT THE END
Do not be upset because it ended, but smile because It happened ❤
Anyone else cant watch past 38 seconds?
The Technoblade part was the most wholesome part of the stream i appreciate you for being serious about it <3 The fact that he did a birthday stream there makes it more nostalgic
The DSMP got me through covid and was honestly the highlight of it
this server changed me bro, changed all of us. thank you for everything <3
So they don't plan on releasing DreamSMP map to public? Damn, i wish i could play ir
Been here since before Tubbo joined, and while I didn’t always stick around, I always came back after a while. Life passed, new chapters of my life have come and gone, but this project - the DSMP - It’s something I’ll always hold dear to my heart.  You lot have done a lot for me, and many others. I’ll always grieve the memories made and the happiness felt during its time. Tommy, Tubbo, Wilbur, Techno, Dream, Philza, George, Sapnap, Erret, Fundy, Hbomb, Purpled, Puffy and all the others I hold dear to my heart because of these past few years, I thank you.  Like before mentioned, I’ll grieve the loss of the smp, but I won’t cry because it’s over, rather, I’ll smile because it happened.
Anyone else cry when he visited technos house
It is ent the sem with aut techno
Goodbye, Dream SMP. I will miss you. o7
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!!!
Why are you not doing it anymore 😢
Nooooooooo
KEEP ON THE DREAM SMP PLS ITS MY FAVOURITE
Dream SMP truly was the best and most epic collaboration ever on youtube  Thank you Dream Team for giving us the best 3 years of our lives.  Hoping for a sequel or reunion soon 👍  Damn, i'm tearing up already
I'm sad to see the smp go but I'm glad it even started, Rip techno
Even though the community warped and grew different overtime and I became less and less involved in it due to that, this specific server will always hold a place in my heart.
2:45  "bottom text" lol
2 years ago my best friend showed me the dream smp. We no longer talk regularly and it feels like an end to an amazing friendship and an end to watching this amazing smp grow. I’m not looking forward to what’s next, but I’m not sad this era ended either. I’m the happiest person because despite Covid, these past 2 years have been the best years of my life because of you guys and my best friend. I’ll think back on this not with sorrow that it’s not continuing, but with happiness that I got to feel like the happiest person ever. Thank you dsmp
just thank you...❤❤❤
Cried during this? maybe.... I was here for every lore stream and everything else, and seeing this part of my life, this one chapter in my life be completed was one of the greatest things ever. Im so sad to see this go, but so glad it had a good ending.
"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened."
At the verry end, it shows the next up video, and it was the first dsmp video from tommy- I don't know if I'm glad it's ended or sad.. 🥲
LETSGGOOOO
Technoblade never diessss.ssssssssssss - Techno and the whole of youtube...      Goodbye, Dream SMP. You were Tommy's best friend, also ours. All the days we spent watching Tommy, on this server, felt incredible My last and final goodbye... 👋👋 🫂🫂
Good
FINALLY
Amazing video ❤😊
The dream sup was the first thing that I actually loved and it was like a safe space to me, it’s sad to see the last video of the Dream SMP but it was always amazing and everyone was amazing. Thank you to the dream SMP for making me happy when i was down. And R.I.P our king technoblade hes smiling looking how much the dream SMP member's have groun and got more comfortable.
It's sad that the smp Has ended 😔 😢
Cry's 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
The dream SMP might go but we will Never forget it and the impact it gave on us
that final glance at the camera before leaving the end really got to me
Pucha Marquina, lo voy a extrañar en Dsmp y nunca lo olvidaría, creo que será un adiós para todos los miembros  Nota: Big T ando Big Man respect UnU
goodbye dsmp i loved you :]
Please reconsider😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I cried at the last part it was so sad and upsetting 😢
and that's it the end of the Dream smp... good times good times farewell dream smp
I’m so happy that the DSMP existed, it’s really carried me through my life, and it really helped me when I was going through a tough time. It’s sad to see it come to an end, but it had a good run.
I’m a bit late, but I just wanted to comment on how happy this server made me. I still remember when I first discovered it back in 2020 around July 6 or 7th through a VOD on Tommy’s channel of the first ever DreamSMP stream and I went straight over to twitch and binge watched from the beginning :’)  I was in a bad place mentally because of Covid, but when I tuned into those streams, it all faded away and I felt such genuine joy. I connected with so many friends through our love for this SMP and even started a few of my own that have become a staple part of my life. I can’t say I could’ve done that without inspiration from the work of everyone on this server. Truthfully, you’re all amazing and you’ve done such great work here.   I may not have stayed active in the fandom all this time, but every time I see a new TommyInnit video, I’ll always tune in no doubt. Thank you for the happiness you’ve brought to me and so many others by just being yourself in front of a video camera. 🫶
Although I was never able to catch any streams or know much about the lore, finding out about the DreamSMP changed my life. it was what introduced me to your and the other’s content in 2020 which was always a great joy to watch when I was feeling down. So although I will never know much about the actual smp, knowing I grew up with such funny and amazing people is good enough for me. Goodbye DreamSMP and stay amazing king ❤
Truly iconic
Hehe
I HAVE MORE SUBS THAN U WITH A WHOLE 17
TOMMY WHATS THE IP
gg's its been a good series<3
The dream smp has helped me to figure out shit in my life, it helped me find out about my sexuality, helped me to find friends, helped me through my sad days, and so much more. Despite what people say about this fandom, I genuinely made so many memories and I don't regret being apart of it
GAYYYY (but in a good way)
That's what made me play Mc now I'm like abt to cry 😢
technoblade was there he just had a green screen skin on      for legal reasons this is a joke don't start a riot
:( I hope you make more content on your other channels and still stream I'm literally crying
Every time I watched dream SMP it was through techno. I’m really happy you made this, as it made the dream smp ending something to remember, instead of what it was in my mind, as something that had drifted off into obscurity.
Why the last .😢
Don't think life will be the same without these streams they became a part of my life seeing it end if probably one of the hardest thing that will happen.
7:22
Why did they quit?
o7
wait hes quiting
Zam
what a great smp
Holy shit. I didn’t really watch a whole bunch of the DSMP but I was there for a few bits and this video, this video got me. The last listen and the visit to Techno got me sobbing, I didn’t even really watch Techno either, but it’s still sad. Goodbye Dream SMP, you were good
when you went to technos base i actually broke down into tears
If this was a dream atleast I got memories for when morning comes   A part of me wished technoblade would be here at this moment  Curse he has made memories and I just loved him so much  RIP technoblade (Alex) 🕊
17:27 made me cry
this series of the smp was the best RIP techno ;(
oh wait, dreamsmp didnt die 2 years ago?
o7
Are you never gonna post a video again?? :(((( 😢
Thank you for everything o7
❤
Bro I sobbed when it ended
It’s over 😢
I have not watched the Dream SMP for a long time but at the time when I would watch it everyday was probably the most comforting times of my life.
It was never meant to be
o7 for Dream SMP😢
Its sad that tommy never built the "DRISTA HOTEL"
The only 1 that wasn't there to see how it ended
I joined the DreamSMP Fandom about 1 and half years ago. Even though I wasn't here for the whole time, I want to say thank you to everyone. Everyday I would come home and I would watch all of their newest vids. Thank you. You helped me though my hardest.
Dont be cry because its over, smile because it happened.
It’s finally over.
So glad to be part of this community. The Dream SMP has truly changed so many people's lives for the better. Thanks for everything! 💚
Is it really last vid?
HALLELUJAH 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Let's raise our glasses for the bright future for Tommy and his friends. I am grateful to witness this journey
This seriously was one of the best parts of my life. You all have inspired myself and so many others with your amazing work and brought so much joy during one of the toughest times for many. Thank you Tommy and everyone on the DSMP. So long o7
April fools the dream smp never ends
R I p techno,may you murder orphans in peace(also can someone put a mural next to techno house plz)
I may have left this part of my life a bit ago but I’ll definitely miss it now
dream smp gave the the greatest memories especially during covid. i never thought i would have tears in my eyes while watching a stream. thank you for all the great memories and laughter
It's sad to see it go but I'll forever be grateful and fond of the memories
o7 thank you tommy, thank you everyone for this wonderful journey
Barack Obama
He killed Dream, and landed the final blow. Now that's a epic ending to a series. 🙂
Tommylnnit never stop in dream smp 💔
Thanks for everything, goodbye everyone, its was a pleasure to met you all:)❤
That last second click
Man... This video brought me joy of tears. The dream smp really kept me company through the covid outbreak yk. Just seeing it end now, is just heartbreaking but yet, yeah. I dont know what to really say but thank you so much Tommy, thank you I really mean it, you all mean so much to me and im glad i get to see this video with everyone else even as heartbreaking as it is. Im just glad we all made it here together through the hard and good times. <3 I love you all.
I’m crying rn. The dream SMP will forever be missed. I watched them all the time when I was sad. Tommy always cheered me up. I love that server and it will be so sad to see it go.❤❤❤😪😪  And as the great legend said “ Not even close baby, Technoblade NEVER dies!”
Can someone explain why this is the last stream? i haven’t watched in a little while but this really did have an impact on my life and i wanna know why they’re stopping streaming 11:45
It’s so cool—that nostalgic feeling of lone when you’ve finished saying your last goodbyes; when you’ve understood that you’ll never see it again; when you’ve realized that your fleeting memories are all that’s left—memories bound to be overridden by the new, only for what’s new to meet the same fate. So cool.
Maybe I’ll actually be able to catch up on all the lore now
Only if techno blade would have been here to see this
it has been an honor to watch the forming and end of this story o7
That hurt
To friend group
Invite Tarii
Goodbye dream SMP. We will miss you.

Damn that shit was deep😢

I cried when he went to techno's house. Way too many memories. RIP King
When tommy arrived at techno and the music started playing i just started crying

Welp its been a great time😭 the only reason I didn’t kill myself was because of you guys in the smp (and techno and Tommy’s Skyblock series)❤❤❤
"don't cry because it's over be glad that it happened" ☺️ thanks for all the good memories

I will cry😭😭 Because i always watch Dream SMP
This meant so much to me. The DSMP was really a beautiful thing, and im glad I got to be a part of the community and witness it. Thank you so much, it's been truly wonderful. o7 ❤❤❤
This one server changed my life forever, I’m glad it had a happy ending. It’s sad to see it all go away.
It was about 2 years ago I discovered the dream smp and the moment I watched the first dream smp video I was hooked I enjoyed the memories that were made thank you for the memories Tommy along with the other members of the smp
NO SEASON 2 NOOOO-
We all can feel tecno's empty place 😢
This smp is very close to my heart..From the day this Smp started and till now..I will always miss the good moments of this smp ❤❤ "Technoblade never dies" ❤🕊️
Ur so dramatic
Nope. This video made me cry. The link to the video in the end? Man, I don’t think there’s any water left in my body.
Be honest we all were like oh my gash this is sad but when he visited tecno's house it's got 10x sadder nd I watched this vid yesterday but I can't resist watching it again... ;_;
This cvid ik made me emotional. The dsmp had shanked me sm, and i will miss the streams. This is truly an and of an era, and amazing one of that.Goodbye Dsmp. I will miss you 👋
A wise man once said “Don’t cry because it is over, smile because it happened”
Technoblade Never Dies - Technoblade.
this server and its people got me through covid. Thank you <3
Yaaaaz
Is this really the last one 😢
Tommy your mic is dirty 😂
Even tho I wasn't watching the dsmp lore, I did watch them just fool around. The dsmp helped me find these cool YouTubers that I love and gives me laughs today. The dsmp also helped me have fun watching them randomly do stuff when it was the pandemic.Without this, I don't think the Pandemic would of been fun at all. Thank you Dsmp. And well, goodbye Technoblade. Your legacy will never end nor disappear. Your legacy will be in our hearts forever. Rest in Peace Techno ❤️
O7
I watched at the start and didn't watch for very long but it's sad to see it end
WhEn you went to techno I f ing cryed rip tech
The dream smp will never feel the same without techno, he truly brought it to life, I’m glad we shared so many memories together ❤
Noooo
Tommy ain't it Really is a villian
I haven’t cried in 2 years this was worth it
I'm in tears  Imagine our child's say  -Hey Dad What Is The Dream Smp
Farewell to the Dream SMP I say.   🫡  Gone but never forgotten  Farewell  April 26, 2020 to April 10, 2023
The DSMP had such a huge impact in my life, I have so many memories watching it; it’s so sad to see it go but it will always be in my heart 🫶🏻
I discovered Dream SMP by running into a Tommy stream back in 2020, and this has been my cocaine for the past 2 years. Thank you so much for being the crack that led so me and so many of my friends through Covid. Technoblade never dies ❤
o7
Y’all made me cry when u went to technos
I’m really sad that it ended but. everything will eventually come to a end, nothing can always be there. And I’m really glad i found out about the SMP. They have changed my life if I didn’t watch them I wouldn’t have ANY. of my friends that I have now, and my life would be shit. The dream smp has saved my life and has helped me though so many things. Though hard times or when I’m feeling down, no matter what they have always and always. Helped me, I still can’t believe the smp has come to a end and will not have a season two. I’m really glad to be apart of the community and shi but. I think I’m gonna have to just, leave it someday, I mean that’s what’s supposed to happen you leave something and never look or touch it again. I love you tommy you have always been my fav tbh, goodbye tommy.
Goodbye Dream SMP🐐♥️
o7
O7
Love that little nod to jschlatt with that music at the end... 🥲
Now…THEE SECOND ERA MUST BEGIIIIIINNNNN 😂
Thank you for all of the memories Tommy
they didn’t know they were making memories, they just knew they were having fun   Mincraft will always be a memorable game, and so will the smp     I’m crying rn bro
Wait, so does this mean that theirs no season two. Why did they decide to end it. The dream smp is my home 🥺
о7
O7
The ending…     I cried to much
bro this video made my tears come out of my eyes

The tour of techno's house made me cry so hard 😭, may he rest in power, forever undefeated

i was putting this video off because i was afraid to cry. now its 10:32 am on a sunday and im bawling☹️ the dreamsmp helped me get through a really tough time in my life. all of you guys have grown so much and im so very proud. o7.
Man, im gonna cry. The dream SMP was a server I cannot ever forget. It changed my life a lot. Im happy that this server was created and all the memories on it. Its so sad to say goodbye. I don’t want to, but I knew the time would come eventually. Its heartbreaking that this is the last ever stream. Thank you all for making and shaping the dream SMP as it is today. Im glad that it existed and it was something that truly made me happy to watch it. ❤️
*Dont cry because it’s over, smile because it happened.*
It's truly been a great experience watching Dream SMP videos. Respect, i will never forget the server! ❤
The Dream SMP was my favorite thing to watch in covid times, I loved it and I loved watching you in it this is truly heartbreaking how it’s your last time. Thank you Tommy. Thank you for everything you did.

o7 for all of the good times on the server
Even though I got to the dream smp lore pretty late, it was so much fun to see everyone and get to know everyone’s channel. I’m gonna miss this, and thank you Tommy for being the best youtuber ever. Love you man, and here’s to many more great years
I never really interacted with the dream smp streams, mostly because i was sleeping while they were streaming (i live on the other side of the world) but i watched them whenever i could and i was apart of the fanbase/fandom and it really changed me for the better, its sad techno couldnt be here to see the end but im really greatful it even happened.
16:34 When it had When it had all the OG flashbacks 🥹🥹🥹🥹
The fact that his first ever dsmp vid is the recommended vid right after this vid is amazing 😢🎉🎉❤
Thank you to everyone on this server. You've made this series a real joy to watch.
Aww man I srsly dont know what to comment this is amazing and sad at the same time, but thank you so so so much. The dream SMP made my life so much better and I don't about the haters they can go fuck themselves xD to be honest I didn't think I would cry watching this but I did I fucking cried like a 😺. But anyways thank you to all of you, o7 Technoblade <33
Thank you for everything, Goodbye Dreamsmp
This is nostalgic and we all have memories and they don’t last forever   -techno blade never dies
The fact that when tommy was going to techno’s house he was constantly making jokes and laughing to prevent being emotional
I cried
People keep shitting on the Dsmp and it’s people but these people changed me changed millions of people and this was the nest of it all I am forever grateful for all of this and I know other people are too, thank you Dsmp and thank all of the content creators that we’re on it
Man it feels so weird because it only feels like yesterday when I’d hurry back home from school and see if tommy, Wilbur, or techno was streaming. This server has gotten me through some hard times, and it’s inspired me to try out content creating of my own.  o7 thanks for the good memories
I still miss technoblade 😢
Background music just hits even harder when you realise it's over😢
Dream SMP 🐐!! SAD TO SEE IT GO!
The Technoblade part really got me 😭
Im not crying shut up
Oh, and Philzer has not posted in two months
First, it was Technoblade, and now we have TommyInnit stopping making videos
What about ur per in end?
i once heard dont be sad that its over be happy it ever happened
I’d be lying if I said I don’t have tears in my eyes.Fuck man, the memories. When I’d wake up I’d see who’s streaming and join ,see them fuck around. When I come home from school having the shittiest day ever and just see tommy and tubbo or the dream team streaming. When I see that a DSMP member posted a new YouTube video , I will never for the happiness and the warm feeling in my heart. Thank you for giving me such happiness no one can ever make me as happy as I felt. Truly some of the best humans god has created. My love for these people will never end. It’s crazy how I know so little about people but I’d give my life for them, It’s crazy how these people changed my life and created a better version of myself. I love everyone on the DreamSMP and that won’t ever change . -miles ❤
why they ended it guys ?
it brings me back good memories,and it's sad that all of it ended
It is pretty sad to know that Tommy left the Dream smp. But it was fun while it lasted. Goodbye Dream smp
o7

I cried- all the memories the only thing I watch-
As soon as I saw the thumbnail... YESSSS TOMMY DOING ARSON AGAIN!!!!!!!

Imagine it was an april fool 😅
Techno blade will be proud of this moment because you were his prodigy and after dream he cared and loved you likes brother so   IT MAY BE A PAIN IN THE BUTT BUT  IF YOU SAY ITS TIME WE JUST HAVE TO AGREE TO DIAGREE  Peace to the server
If I never started watching the dream SMP I have no idea who I would be right now, Thank you to everyone ❤️
🕊️❤️🥲
Dream smp changed my life I watched every dream smp video but I knew it was gonna end soon
Why would you leave this beautiful server?
I’m getting a tattoo of the SMP. it was such a huge part of my life back in COVID and high school and it still impacts me to this day, the relationships that were formed, the story that evolved and the way people changed and developed and aged with me. Might go have a solid cry lol. Cannot thank you guys enough.
Technoblade Never Dies
It's been a long way but it needed to end someday. "Not even close! Technoblade never dies!" rest in peace.
distracted me throughout the whole of covid. thank you.
Definitely had me tearing up at the end, such a wonderful experience that was shared with us all. I will definitely miss the dreamsmp but there's no going back. It changed my life, and we've all grown so much since it started. Here's to the future.
Techno never dies 🥹
Oh but wait! Is Dream SMP season 2 going to be an actual thing, or is even that completely drawn out?...
You were in the WHAT?!?!
This stream changed something in me, I was crying for most of it, it really hit me hard, the dsmp was a really big part of who I was
and this is where an era ends. I remember during the pandemic watching this whole smp everyday. But my most favorite was Tommy, his commentary was just really entertaining for me, even the editing (thank u editors!!)  It's pretty sad that Techno isn't here to experience this final moment with the gang but, this was a nice journey. With it's up and downs, I can proudly say I was there.  Thank you, DreamSMP! o7 <3
And that's how Tom finished his journey....
Dream SMP was something that saved me, made me forget all of my problems, the fact that we all were here for this long journy.Honestly Dream SMP meant so much to me still does, i cant believe ive been here for around 3 years its awesome, right now new chapters of our lifes are begging. Ill forever be thankful for everyone and everything that happend o7....<3
Pls post 1 more plss

I'm honored that I was once a fan of dream smp and will always be. Being in this fandom is really one of the amazing part of my life, I started watching this (dream smp) when Tommy first time joining the server and I'm happy that I'm able to witness this day that it will end it's sad but life must go on..... A Fan since 2019 from Philippines🇵🇭   🥂cheers to the past, to present and to the future

o7.
THANK GOD
WAR IS OVERRRR
I'm gonna miss that server.....😭😭😭
I was never really in touch with the Dream SMP but I was almost in tears watching this. Especially the part where Tommy visits Techno's cabin. 😭I feel so sad that this is coming to an end. I hope that everyone will remember this as a great era.  Fly high Technoblade. 🕊👑🐷
Thank you. This was cathartic.
The Dream SMP was awesome, this is really sad that it came to an end. But it's better for the good things to end in a good way. I will always keep this part of my life watching those videos in my heart.
Just cried so much. You saved my life and I’m just sad to see it all go. Thank you for everything.
gues this it is
The last?
Series + channel died months ago who tf still cares
It hits so hard like a nuke or an freaking planet that Technoblade is gone but his home and pets are still there
why did you guys have to end this? i mean, you guys can still play here even the lore has ended.
Dream Smp honestly changed me in lockdown always dreamed of being on it but you know it is what is 😢
I could do a thousand essays containing millions of characters, but I think I'm just gonna go with a simple o7. Thank you DreamSMP. You'll be missed.

Seeing Techno's house made me very sad
Thank you, Tommy.
At the end of this i fr started to cry. This server has made my life so great and I'm so sad to see it go.
:( good bye dream smp
Im fucking crying right now. It's so nostalgic and so many memories from it. I can't believe it's the end. The l'mamburg war... Also at the end of the 2021 summer I created Cat 'manburg. It was also destroyed. And techno died... I loved watching it and I still think it's the best series in the whole world , even if I'm Polish.
Build shrine 4 techno
A wise man once said: "Don’t cry because it’s over,smile because it happened."   I’m super happy and grateful to have found the DSMP in the first place. In fact you were literally the reason that I found the DSMP I found the dsmp from your vids lol. It has been such a journey and so many memories. From the beginning of L’manberg. The disc war.. the festival.. the destruction of l’manberg and more. I would like to thank you and the other content creators for the fun times and everything you guys did for us. The dsmp will forever have a place in my heart and I will never forget you guys it was heartwarming to see all of you guys together having fun on the server for one last time and I hope you guys continue to live good lives. It’s been a honor to be in this fandom and to witness all of the events  thanks again also o7 techno :) blood for the blood god Goodbye Dsmp
U should upload on youtube with bbh and dweem and gogi
It’s sad that dream SMP is ending but I am happy that I got to see these beautiful years btw rest in peace tecnoblade 🤍
thank God it’s over
wow i thought i wasnt gonna cry abt your last dsmp stream/video o did
this hit harder than ludwigs last stream
101,000th like
Please don’t bind using bandages. It can be seriously harmful. Dysphoria can be horrible sometimes but it can damage your ribs. This isn’t attacking you I’m just concerned for your physical health. Could you possibly find a different alternative? One that isn’t as harmful? Im not hating or mad at you or anything, even though we don’t know each other I don’t want you getting hurt.
I’m not crying you are
Mad how since the face revea the views have gone
now what
:) I'll miss this...
Lol Tommy said last 2 years even though everyone remembers that bro became big in 2020 cuz he had time big time
Oh myyyy I cried while watching the stream. Dream SMP is going to stay in my memory for a very long time! I'M SURE. When I discovered it in covid It meant everything to me. Watching all the streams and you tube videos made me smile even at my worst days. I'm so grateful I saw your stream on twitch and clicked on it! When I watch your videos/streams it still makes me smile and forget about all the bad and stressful things I have to go through right now/ and had to go through then :]] I enjoy watching your serious channel too. I rewatch the videos sometimes even a few times in a row. Keep up with all the awesome work Tommy :]] Thank you for everything!  Not only Tommyinnit, but all the other members of dsmp!  (I still watch you and will be watching you! I kinda sounded like a goodbye.. but it's not!)
Im just sad that the blade is not there
Huh! What!!
I wish technoblade could see this <3
the best video ever tommy:)
Im so emotional
A member once said: GET OUT OF MY HOUSE TOMMY . Rest in peace technoblade
Dream smp was so good memories and this is the end? This made me cry 😭
Thanks for the past 3 years of my life. Goodbye, DreamSMP. o7
i cried so hard dude o7
😢
peace at last.
We laugh so we don't cry
dream smp will never be the same without techno
I haven’t really watched the Dream SMP in a long time, but in the early stages of covid, it really saved me and my mental health. Thank you for all the wonderful memories, thank you to the whole fandom who I could talk to. I also think that it is amazing how much the fandom could make in that amount of time: the fan art, the fan made discord servers where there was always something fun happening, even the fanfiction (although it might seem a bit weird, but there were really some extremely good things written by the people).  Thank you to everyone and goodbye Dream SMP! ❤❤❤
Ah the nostalgia at techno's house and as said Technoblade never dies
I don't know what to say I'm crying and speechless all of the amazing and joyfull memories Thank you so much dream SMP for all the memories😢😔😔😭 I just want to say is "GOOD BYE DREAM SMP YOU WILL ALWAYS BE REMEMBERED 😔😔😢😭😭😭😭😭🤍🕊️🕊️"
Hold on Tommy's last video on yt ever or the end of dream smp?

“It was never meant to be”❤️
Thank you so much for the memories,for these years of covid. Even 16:16 made me in tears, TY FOR THE MEMORIES!!!!

i dont watch mcyt anymore, but the dream smp carried me thru the pandemic and at one point i was hella invested in the storyline. I was in 7th grade. now im almost a junior in highschool and i randomly clicked ts at 3.28am cause i wanted to see how it ended lol. Rip techno as well.
Please tell me tommy
The technoblade part was emotional
What is a woman

This made me tear up so much. Dream SMP truly changed my life. The memories everything every second about it I will truly miss this masterpiece. I will never forget this masterpiece Goodbye.
“That made me cryyyy” :)
So many memories, loved it
buh bye dreamsmp you served us well.
im sad that i wasnt apart of the dsmp sooner so many great things missed but yet i still joined and though it was off and on there was always one thing keeping me there...Techno and i couldn't believe it when he died when the ender dragon was dead i cant help but think he'd already be soaring for the sky's to take on gods domain cause that was the type of person he was to me... a hero and i'm not sad about what didnt happen i'm just glad about what did.    and well as a wise man once said, "so long nerds"                          ps. he also taught me all my bedwars skills for which i am infinitely grateful
oh
Tommy, thank you for this best finale ever. The day that I met Dream SMP,  I knew this is the most interesting content I will ever watch. I don’t know how to describe, all of this just full of love, friendship, even sometimes we have some sad news, we still didn’t forget the original intention, the past, keep going through… This make me tear up. We will keep supporting you Tommy, and all the others Dream SMP friends❤ keep trying!Tommy!
Being a dream smp fan living in Utah and having a birthday that falls on November 16th seems very poggers right about now
o7 dream smp and techno. You both will have a place in the darkest of hearts. ❤😢
It was a pleasure to watch you, You were my best Idol. Ilv dsmp
The SMP was a huge part of Tommy.  I loved watching his videos after school pretty much everyday! Long live the SMP.
o7
😢
Bro the way that the first ever video Tommy made on the DSMP pops up at the end is just so cool. This was the good ending.
Well that's emotional
Im gonna miss the dream smp, it was fun while it lasted :]
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.
Dream smp  will always hold something in my empty heart but
THE END
this vid is soo sad:((((
Since the dsmp started, i remember coming back from school and straight up just went to my tabet and started binging ur videos. During online classes (especially boring ones), I remember watching you killing Dream with a minecart. To this day, I am so happy that I was one of any to watch this era. I deeply wish that Technobalde could be here. Thank you to everyone for playing a role in my life. R.I.P. Techno <3.
Thank God this shit series is over
W
When he entered techno's house and stealing stuff i thought that o man if techno sees this he is going to repeat history and then i remembered something 😢😢
We DESPERATELY NEED an animation about it!!!!
Tommy, somehow you always make me laugh. You are a great story teller.. Thank you for your Dream SMP gsmeplay and videos. Always enjoyable.
Give us the server ip for free
Don’t be sad it’s over smile because it happened
How dream was so dispointed that tommy called him to unban him lol dream sound so tired rip dsmp I cried once I saw on tiktok that yall were ending ,y heart hurts
I wanted to cry by the end of the video. Thank you so much for this server, and thank you to all the people who were on it. Both the old, the new, and the strange. Like most, it changed my life and I had such a good time. Before knowing about the lore, before engaging in theories on Twitter, before looking at fan art and animations, before being in the height of it all, I stayed for the laughs. A lot of the content brought a smile to my face after a long day, and I’m happy to have been here at the end with another one.  Goodbye Dream SMP, it’s been a pleasure o7
goodbye! and thank you for the memory
Thank You, DreamSMP
"goodbye" :(
And the dream ends here❤
I tried to be a man today, not cry, every man should cry like I did, thanks for the memories tommy
I was crying through out the video  Literally because it's the last and final video of the dream smp. It was generally a part of my life😢
Bro this has been a trip, I'm glad I got to be part of it.   Rip Techno and I hope you have a good day.
It was great to be here with all of you and witness this. I was so lucky to be part of this.  Goodbye, forever.
Goodbye boys
Cya mate.
this server changed so many lives and things. i'm so glad to know dreamsmp... oh man i feel sad and nostalgic about it, thank you guys!
These melody and chasing woke up some memories. This is it, the end of the great.
Ever since techno, yknow, I've stayed very very out of touch with the DSMP and it's members. But I'm glad that I got to see the end, no Season 2, no spin offs. Just a good, fulfilling finale.  Thank you to Dream, GeorgeNotFound, Callahan, Sapnap, Awesamdude, DropsByPonk, BadBoyHalo, TommyInnit, Tubbo, Fundy, Punz, Purpled, WilburSoot, Jschlatt, Skeppy, Eret, JackManifoldTV, Nihachu, Quackity, Karl Jacobs, HBomb, Antfrost, Ph1LzA, ConnorEatsPants, CaptainPuffy, Ranboo, Foolish Gamers, Hannahxxrose, Michaelmcchill, Slimecicle, Eryn, TinaKitten, BoomerNA, Seapeekay, Aimsey, And last but certainly not least, Technoblade.  You have all, been a very important, if not small, part of my life, and i owe every single one of your influences on my life for the person I have grown to become today.
I’m crying 😢😢😢
But is tommy still making regular content?

Until the they we met
im holding back tears
Any time a show or community you've been a part of comes to an end, it's always sad, and anyone who has followed the Dream SMP may relate to this video's title. Though all good things must come to an end, it's crucial to keep in mind that the memories and learnings we have earned from this adventure will last a lifetime.  I have to say that it's been an amazing experience as someone who has followed the Dream SMP since its infancy. This was a memorable experience thanks to the narrative, the characters, and the community as a whole. I look forward to following the members of the Dream SMP wherever they go and am appreciative of all the experiences they have given us.  We appreciate your participation in the Dream SMP, both on and off-screen. You've made something absolutely exceptional, and your diligence and hard work have not gone ignored.
Tommyinnit ruined the dream smp
WHY DID HE MAKE IT SO SAD  Im crying such. tough fucking MAN tears. rn. oh my god.    thank you for the memories.

About time the dream smp ended
All I have to say is rip dsmp
The Dream SMP left a mark on millions of peoples lives over the past few years and it’s been a crazy rollercoaster to have been on. It’s time to move on and be hopeful for the future and respect those who came along. Rest in peace Alex, Technoblade never dies

When the Covid pandemic broke out, it felt like my whole life went downhill. I found out my friends, weren't really my friends, and I cut all my ties. Every last one. I was alone. I was even considering ending it all. But when I watched that first stream, it just brought a new love into my life. Even though I was never super invested, this is what kept me going. I've never admitted this before, but I feel like now is an appropriate time to say how much this has meant to me. Thank you. Because every last person on this sever, in this fanbase, artists, animators. You've done more than you know. I wish I could've been watching more streams, they're always better live. But, I'm glad I got what I did. I'm in a better place now, and still getting help because of every one of you here. Don't give up, I promise you. It's worth it.
You, Tubbo, Wilbur, Techno, Ranboo, Phil. Even fucking L'manburg. You all saved me more times than I can count, and I wasn't ready for the amount of emotions through brought up, but I'm glad it did. Thank you Tommy. Thank you.  o7 boys o7
W video
tummy in it you do realize you made me cry to the point where my phone is almost broken
I was doin ok untill tommy got emotional when he went to techno’s cabin then I was not ok 😂  The dream smp will always hold a very special place in my heart and it’s so sad to see it go. 😭
"You want to a be a hero ,Tommy? Then DIE LIKE ONE" 😢
This series changed a lot for me but it's ok that's it's gone now. Don't be sad it's gone, be happy for the memories we all shared together. o7 to you all minecrafters!
damn. that techno bit hit me way harder than I ever thought it would. I truly dont cry that easily, and havent been the biggest Dream SMP enjoyer, but that techno segment hit so hard. I really miss techno. From his dark and halarious humor, to the comedic timing he was so good with.   o7 - techno never dies 👑🐷
The DSMP will forever have changed my life. It is the only way I have gotten through school. 💔😞
The end of an internet era, from when covid plagued the world we could find entertainment on Tommy's loudness and the Dream SMP as a whole! Thank you to all thoose behind the stories, plots and laughs...its been a journey, and all journeys must end <3
Thank you for putting this last stream together Tommy 😊 I'm so glad so many people joined you and Tubbo. And that I was able to actually watch it live! What a wonderful time I had watching you on the DSMP.
wow.
They did it guys. It's time for us to go and sen how much they've grown. I belive everyone in this fandom will be very succesful. Now its our turn.O7 last time for the Dream smp
i cant belive its actually ending. dsmp really build me up as a person, i dont know what i wold be if i hadn't watch skeppy vidoes and then stumbling upon bbh, then dream, and then you tommy. along the way i also watch techno and he's still till now my no 1 fav youtuber ever. im so glad with the memories we've shared for the last 2 and a half years, and thank you vor everything! ❤
While I will say it kinda just lulled after dream wa spit in prison we still can’t go without saying that this was one of the biggest things of gaming history
o7 :)
Dream SMP has had such a positive impact on my life. I found people in streaming I wouldn't have otherwise and I found creators that made me happy with me. It's been a wild ride and I'm sad to see it go but I'm just happy it happened.  o7 chat. and of course RIP Technoblade Fly high <3
I tried getting into this series on a number of occasions, but I could never find more than 3 streams or videos that were in chronological or comprehensible order.
It is not the end of the Dream SMP it willl maybe eventually be back i swear :) Because of the dream smp i learnt a lot about life and really i hope u guys will be back XD anyways where is DreamXD ?
The end of a chapter the start of a new era
im not crying YOUR crying😪😭😢
Been here since day 1 I can’t believe it’s finally over, unbelievable and I really enjoyed all the laughs and how much all of our lives have changed since the start of dream smp. It will go down in history 😭🙏🏻
2:46 the subtitles say bottom text briefly
i cried. this has been a part of my life and changed me for the better good. i love you guys.
This'll be always remembered. For better or worse. It'll never be forgotten
Tommy was the funny, the humor, the danger, and especially the chaos of the dream smp. He has made the smp THE smp. He made the laughs, trolls, especially the fights. The 2 years of the dream smp was amazing to watch. But now it’s time to say goodbye. Not everything lasts forever. At some point, your gonna have to say goodbye to something you love. Thank you tommyinnit for making me laugh and encourage me to be a streamer. Thank you.❤❤❤
I'm so sad that your leaving ive watched all your dream smp videos and this is the last one this video made me cry this will be my last comment i love you so much tommy bye. from beckham

Bro, I cried so such in this bcz one of the things I would've had would have been to watch the sunset with Technoblade. See him once more before I left and didn't come back. Be killed by him then log off. That's the amount of respect I want to own
Best stream of all time ❤
You made my motivation to play roblox
o7 and thank you
I cried a little watching this :,) The COVID memories. Watching Tommy stream on late nights , The Lmanburg war streams. I’m so grateful for it all. Thank you Tommy.
you should watch thats what i like lyrics
I feel empty...
This server means so much to me, it made me happy when I was down. I remember watching the lore streams and loving all the lore. Thank you to everyone in the Dream SMP <3
Wish techno could have been around to see it
I still think the best part is Tommy got over saying that people find him annoying at the start of each video
Thank u dream SMP ❤️ goodbye forever
big
So sad seeing tommy visiting techno’s house for one last time, and the fact that technoblade did not have the chances to be a part of the DSMP final made me crying ☹☹☹😢
me watching the las dream SMP video ever for 100 time
What a legendary server.  So many great and epic moments, lore and no lore.  I remember tuning into your videos and streams during COVID, and chilling while you were doing your shenanigans.  It was so fun, and so incredible.  Thank you DreamSMP, and Tommy, for giving me so many great memories. o7
The dreamSMP was my favorite stream sever ever
I'm crying
I cried when I saw Techno's house.
Fucking finally
WAIT WHEN HE SAID MO MORE CONTENT DOES THAT MEAN LIKE FOR REAL OR JUST NO CONTEBT FOR DSMP
damn
😭😭😭😭
finally
💔
Oh man- this had me emotional. The nostalgia is there, a big piece of my childhood is the Dream SMP. Rip Techno
technoblade🐷👑
This made me cry tbh
The dsmp was sure something, im so happy because all the memories, great art, animations, music, historys and great friends i met thanks to this silly mc server, this finale was a mixture of too much emotions to put in words! Bye dsmp it was great while it lasted but everything must come to an end ♡
I am sad to see the SMP go.  The fact that Tommy when to Techno's made a little emotional
how many finales does one series need
so no season 2 ?????????
"bottom text' I DIDN'T MEAN TO"
THIS MADE ME CRYYY forever greatful for the dsmp
thank you for making covid less of a hell <3
The Dream SMP has helped me (and others) through rough patches in life. I was never fully caught up on lore, cause I was always busy, but when I could,  I would watch old streams and stuff and they always cheered me up! Thank you to everyone who was a part of the dream smp, you've definitely left a huge impact :D
Thank you all for everything. The last 2 years was amazing.. I can’t believe it’s over, but it was best adventure ever. o7 Technoblade. Thank you <3
goodbye, dream smp. i bet the fandom will always keep you alive</3
I’m so glad I was able to say I saw the finale. It was an amazing and watching them for 2 1/2 years is just crazy. It pains me to see that Techno wasn’t able to be a part of this but this is what he would be wanted.  Fly high king.
I’m trying so hard not to cry cause at the end I see thank u for everything-TommyInit and a video named I joined the Dream SMP and now he hates me
o7
I’m very emotional
Thanks for everything you and all the server members bring to us during covid. During those sad moments, we all been living joy through those amazing lore stream. This server will be missed, but, times are to come, it didn't feel the same since covid was ''over''. My eyes are in the sky, looking at the blood god, who manage to bring this whole server to another level. Thank you Technoblade, we all miss you  o7
I never thought I would ever cry over a video game but here we are… thank you for making some of the best memories for us all
You can hear the pain in his voice when he went into Technoblades house. He will forever be missed. We will all miss the Dreamsmp but it’s time we all grow up. I hope you live a great life.
Subscribe for a donut 🍩
Hey tommy can you visit hypixel skyblock again? I really liked your videos back then especially the jerry
bruh why am i sad i never watched the smp lol
Tommy, I started watching the Dream SMP late but even I could see how far you've come. You're my complete idol and watching your videos has helped me through so many shitty days. You're videos always made me laugh and they still do. I remember a year ago when I wanted to join the server and now I've just watched it end. Thanks for everything, you are so fucking cool.
Thanks everyone for the best years of my life
Congrats to whoever is early and found this comment🏆
No you better not or I will never watch you again
its done, boys. we did it.
I’m gonna miss it so much :(🫶
Technoblade never dies
The dream smp was one of my best eras and always and forever will it have a special place in my heart. I will miss coming home and being able to wacht your streams tommy. These past three years are now history.. ANYWAYS THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS IN THE HOW TO SEX BOOK?! IVE BEEN WONDERING FOR SO LONG?? ( o7 Dsmp )
We’ll never forget the memories of the DSMP o7 It’s been a wild ride :)
dont be sad that its gone, be happy that it happened
Ima guess the Dsmp is gone because of technos death... I feel so bad for his family and truely miss technopig. May we never forget Dsmp and techno.
God, when the smp started, i was in college and I remember watching every single livestream ect. Now I have a toddler and about to give birth to my 2nd baby. Memories
why did it end?
you could say the dream smp sunsetted
Dont know how to feel tbh but saying thank you for one of the best eras in covid
Why did I start crying 😢
Yoooooo celeste music in the end!!!
I knew this video would be good but I wasn't prepared for the *FEELS*
The first time I watched the Dream Smp was june 30th 2020 I think and know almost 3 years later it has ended and sad the techno wasn't here to see it, this video is so nastolgic, the Dream Smp has changed my life forever.
the dream smp changed my life. for the better, and for the worse. some people say "it was never meant to be", but i think it was. i was meant to find the dream smp. if i hadnt found it, my life wouldnt have been as good as it was. everyday, after school, i came home, hoping that i could see another dream smp video. i was obsessed. i cried, laughed, screamed, honestly everything i could do, i did. thank you, dream smp. thank you, tommy. thank you, everyone.  o7. goodbye, dream smp. i will miss you.
FINALLYYYY
DAYUM IAM GETTING SAD
I saw this whole stream live, and I definitely cried. Almost cried again here too. The dsmp got me through a really rough period of my life, it helped me meet and connect with people, it helped improve my art skills even. It's been really fun, but all good things must come to an end eventually, right?
You have no idea how this server changed my life, for the past 2 yrs i've watched every stream back to back, and i never would have thought i would use this as a coping skill whenever i feel down, i'd just sit there in my room and watch every stream that includes the dream smp, its so sad that its over but y'know all good things must come to an end eventually, so for the last time before i never see the dream smp be mentioned again. I'd rewatch every lore stream made in that category.. dream smp made history and changed multiple lives, farewell dsmp^^
😢
Sometimes I forget how much this fandom had a choke hold on me. It really was a time. I'll never forget it. Fare well Dream SMP. Thank you for everything. o7 <3
man I miss techno
The greatest moment was when he looks up at the camera and smiled before jumping through the portal and all fades out... It was peace and resolution for Tommy and even just for his character being able to literally end the story on a great note with everyone he was close to.
It was always  so fun and exciting to watch the dsmp and it's  so sad  to see it go:(
thanks you tomy, and everyone in the DSMP, for helping me and tons of other people get through a tough time in life. thank you.
This is the first time, in many years, I have ACTUALLY cried from a YouTube video.
Thank you from the deepest part of my heart, thank you. Its been an honour.
o7
That was the saddest videos I've ever seen
Noice
the dsmp was a good lore and story to see on our eyes, thanks tommy for that good lore and story and we happy too, stay strong
I'm so so thankful for all of you💗 This server/series changed my life, and I'm glad I got to see it while it was still at it's peak. I'm also glad to know that the content's still gonna be there for anyone who wants to watch you guys have fun while entertaining millions of people.
its over.
I cried soo much during when Tommy went to go visit technoblade’s house and it made me super sad to see Tommy cry aswell<33 RIP technoblade..you well never be forgotten<33
Hol' up! Is Tommy actually quitting Youtube?!?!
man this was peak entertainment during covid ah memories
Rip techno
The DreamSMP was a big part of my life, and I’m sure many other people’s lives too, during Covid-19 it made us all smile, laugh, or even cry. And gave us something to always enjoy and think about when we were stuck inside. It’s an honour to be able to say “I’ve been here since the start of L’manberg!”. Thank you to everyone involved, both the creators and the fans. Everyone made this server and this community what it is today, something we can look back on and think “damn, that was such an awesome time”. Thank you, Tommy, for telling such a funny little story within this server, and thank you to everyone else involved who made it the amazing thing it was. And of course, o7 to Technoblade, we all miss him and we would never get such an incredible story out of this server without him and his pets. Technoblade never dies, and neither will the memories of the DreamSMP. <3
thank god its the last
bruh
The mlg being a jojo reference
its just the best
Thank you Dream SMP! The server still means the world to me... thank you for everything.
Technoblade never dies 💔😭💐
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!!
The technoblade part of the video hit me mad hard I almost cried there. I'm glad the Dream SMP was created in the first place.
The moment that the old memories and thechnoblade got brought back it got me tearing up a bit may he rest and always have a place in my heart same for the smp❤️
I thought tommy quit youtube XD
Im sad and all but watching this made me think what would happen if tommy creates a tommy smp and every one gets on hit idk but about that i have a weard feeling on thinking that tommy will be op and the owner on tommy smp
o7 dam right
Great video full of nostalgia. Thanks for all your content back in the covid time
I litteraly cried when he went to techo's home... we miss him so much
that was it..? IM CRYING DO MUCH RN IVE BEEN WATCHING HIM FOR 2 YEARS NOW😭
TechnoBlade never dies
Thanks for the memories even if they had to end now, and the fact how one kid in 2018 can change so much with a group of people is bizarre. Thank you Dream SMP  <3
o7
Oh man. It really is the end. one last time, o7.
had me crying when you went to techno's house
"Don't be sad it's over. Be happy it happened." Yeah well I'm both right now so shush you quote.
This is how it ends well I wish that techno was here he would probably had the best time in this Techno Blade the person that had a incredible way of helping others with out trying his vids are amazing😢 I can’t believe this is how the dream smp ends I love this time we had to watch and it will never end in the hearts of others😊
When you visited technoblade’s place, a small part of me died knowing that along with the server, technoblades house will be gone too.
One friend left to sell drugs One works down by the prison One had 3 kids but lives alone One’s brother is a ghost One’s already on his last life One’s just barely getting by But… these people raised me and I-I-I Can’t wait to go home And I’m on my way And I still remember these  Old prime pathways When we thought war was the answer And I miss the way, you made Me feel, it’s real When we watched the sunset  On the couch over lmanburg
Finally the dream stans are free
I can't say anything that hasn't already been said.  The Dream SMP was such an awesome thing to be a part of. I cried when you visited Techno's base and rang the bell.  That's exactly what he would've wanted.  o7🫡  Thanks Tommy, you've done good.
I just can thank the Dream SMP for everything. Thanks to everyone who participated it and made it a grandious and special adventure. O7 Technoblade.
Good
Oh wow... I'm crying right now... Thanks for all the special memories! The tears we now have in our eyes show us how much the Dream SMP meant to us. I wish all Dream SMP members the best life in the world! Thank you thank you thank you! So, I'm going to cry a few more rounds now. love you guys! (And Technoblade, thank you for everything too! You remain a legend in our hearts!)
This still doesn't feel real. Thank you for everything dream smp ❤
This brought me so much happiness
I’m crying too much. I just know I’m going to watch this video so many times in the future.❤
11:29 nothing has made me close to crying while watching a video before, well yes i have felt sad but this is the closest i have been
W
10:58 - TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES! o7
Miss techno :(
"and so it ends"
o7
the dsmp saved me during the pandemic and offered me comfort and a 2nd home. can’t believe it gone.
The editing, the op, the ending, technos house, pressing the disconnect button.  I’m going to cry, this was such an important thing in my life. It kept me going. Thank you so much. I love you all. o7
im sad to see it go
Two years ago, when I discovered the Dream SMP, I didn't think it'd have much of an impact on my life. Looking back, it really saved me, and I'm gonna miss it. o7, It's been an honor, and thank you so much for everything you've done for me
I was on this  entire live loved it but it was so sad had tears in my eyes 😢❤
anyone noticed that bottom text at 2:44
Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you so so much DREAM SMP 💚🩷🩵

So sad to see it go, but so happy I was here to watch it. Thanks for the memories <3
For Techno's Honor
this video came out only a few hours after my friend died and so thank you. something about that bittersweet of it all provided some comfort
I can't believe how to sex 1 was a good joke all this time. Speechless
🎉🎉🎉
Technoblade never dies!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤
Who else thinks we should see a kallmekris and tommyinnit collab
This legitimately made me cry. I don't even watch the dream smp, but this was still very emotional.
o7
Man I’m gonna miss dream smp so much lol I think we all are
This was such an insane journey. And I’m so sad to see it go, but I’m glad it happened to beging with :)  When the dreamsmp first started, I’d never thought I’d be watching a stream where everyone killed the dragon as ended the server. Let alone without techno. (o7) Watching this stream and watching Tommy brought back so many memories of watching everyone play dreamsmp. I watched old compilations and it felt like those wars and events happened yesterday. Wow. Goodbye forever dsmp, you will always hold a special place in my heart.
from 0:03 to 0:06 tommy sounded like a honda civic w/ a latop reving to 12k rpm
Well now that it’s over now the fathers shall come back
Farewell Sarge 🖖
TOMMY WHAT THE F***
MaN
unbelievable
Dream smp  was fun and the ending is something we all needed
It was a good journey
The DreamSMP meant so much to everyone, including myself. During covid I was alone and didn't have any friends. And while my internet was always so bad that I couldn't watch the live streams on twitch, I could still enjoy the streams on techno's channel. Him and all of the DSMP cast meant so much to me. When I was little I wanted nothing more than to be an MC youtuber just like tommy, and I greatly look up to him and techno as I'm sure many of people do. I hope one day, through rigorous grinding and determination, I will one day get to meet the DSMP cast as a Youtuber myself.  Thank you all for the memories, Thank you for giving me and many others the strength to continue through covid, And thank you Tommy. For showing the next generation that with some determination and a dream, you can do anything. You and the cast are an inspiration to us all.
I missed the whole Dream SMP thing I honestly don’t know where I was the whole time😭 Very sad I didnt get to experience this phase that everyone has had💀
I love you
wow😕
Man
I cried in the beginning even before you went on the server because the dream SMP has changed my life and it will always have a place in my heart. Thank you
lost for words my boy <3
PogChamp👑
No comment

I have cried so much while watching the whole stream man 😭
o7
Dam
I didn't follow up on what happened, I didnt watch the streams or many episodes, but I can still feel the emotion of finally ending something that long existed, with love and care, destruction and hate being put into it. The memories of this server will always be kept in our minds. o7
Bottom Text?????
season 2  👀
thank you, truly ❤
This was so emotional oh my god :(
Thank you for all the Wonderful memories over these Two-and-a-Half years; It's really been a blast being here, in this community, watching all these lore streams and videos. It's truly been a wild ride, and an amazing experience to be here. I love you all, have a safe rest of your days or nights, and for the last time I'll be saying this on this channel, Goodbye Dream SMP.
(This is a tribute to techoblade and the dream smp) Technoblade has given us all many hours of heard work, streams and incredible content. Seeing his old base, his animals and even his gear hit hard. The dream SMP has not only created tons of content but also changed lives. This video was nostalgic to many, if not all the people who have watched this video. Due to incredible server we made it through covid. Thank you Dream SMP and R.I.P Technoblade.
SUBSCRIBE TO TECHNOBLADE!!!!
is it just me buy Dream's voice sound so deep
thank you for all the memories being able to be here from the beginning is absolutely incredible and being able to see it all unfurl is even more crazy even though i left a year ago i still think about everything this server and you all have done from filling the boredom of the pandemic to just being there i’m so grateful i was here to watch it all
Fav part was Tommy accidentally banning everyone
o7
Wow this brought back so many memories. I’m not crying you are 😭
😢 it made me cry 😭
I'M FUCKING BAWLING
Sentimental Tommy is one thing I never thought I’d see
So long nerds
Tommy visiting techno's home gave me flashbacks and then came techno's death into my mind and I starting to cry this video was so nostalgic ;-;
Why is it raining in my house?
Dream SMP was a huge part of my childhood, I'm so sad to see it go, it helped me through a lot knowing that I could open up Twitch and someone could almost always be live, streaming on the SMP. I'm so glad that I was and still am a part of this amazing fandom. o7.
i creied when he visited technos house O7
O7
Imma be honest I got hit hard with a wave of emotion when you went back to Technoblades base. I’ve always loved watching you and Techno and am so sad to see Dream SMP to its end. RIP Techno and RIP Dream SMP! 😢
Watching all of the videos made me feel like I was also on the server and now to watch it being left forever is so sad...     Dude, why do I have to cry ._.
Tommy their is something wrong with you
Bro really making me wanna cry
o7
Nobody wanted this day to come
Good bye Dream SMP. Gone, but not forgot- no I CAN'T DO THIS. Mincraft YouTubers keep losing things. The SMP, Technoblade. What's next. Wait no. I don't want to know
Why did you end it
DID TOMMY ACTUALLY BAN EVERYONE
It's painful to see this server end as it really got me through a tough time and I honestly am just so grateful for it and all the wonderful memories it gave me and all the laughter it brought us. I still can't believe it's over.. Thank you for everything.
❤
This server changed everything, thank you so much <3
To everything, whether I saw it or not: o7
Although i’m not in the fandom anymore, the memories I had from these past 2 years will forever be cherished.   During covid I was in a horrible place with my friend group and family, and on top of it, covid was at its peak and it made me loose much needed confidence in myself, physically, academically, and socially. Everyone here and this server was the only thing that I looked foward to after school, the only thing that made me happy. From meeting new friends ( that i still have ) from a mcyt discord server, to being subscribed to my favorites, and to never missing a stream. Looking back at how much i’ve grown from these 2 years, how much happier I am now, and realizing part of this growth came from you guys, makes it feel amazing.  The dream smp helped me through so much my freshmen year of high school. They taught my 14 year old self it was ok to like what you wanted to like, it was okay to be different, and to not let others put you down for what you enjoyed. And here i am now, turning 17 in may, and i haven’t watched a mcyt video since technos passing, reliving these amazing memories brought me to laugh, to sob hysterically, and to reflect. Reflect on the beauty this group of people had created since the beginning, the group of people that saved my life.   Thank you for this video, the tribute to techno, and thank you for everything you have done for all of the former and current mcyt fandom. It’s bitter sweet it’s now over, but I will always remember it, even though it wasn’t the best time of my life, you guys made it worth while, and i thank you for that. Although I do not keep up with you guys anymore and probably won’t, keep doing what you love, thank you for saving me and so many others, without you, I really do not think I would be the same person I was today.  In the MCYT Fandom July 2020 - June 2022.
in the minute 12 i have cried so hard
I started crying when I saw Techno's house
“We hope you enjoyed your stay”
wasn’t there going to be that reset thing? since when is this the last of dream smp?
GG Guys
Tommy I have personal beef with you now, just to let you know <333 lots of love, good luck and have fun :))))
Finally
I started watching the dream smp about four months after it started and ever sense then I have learned to be me. The dream smp taught me to not care what others think and to be happy. When I found out it was ending I didn’t believe it. Thank you to everyone on the dream smp for making these past few years some of the best years ever. I love you all sm.
They always say, everything comes to an end. Even if it raised us all. It's been a wonderful time with you tommy.
i like dogs
Im not crying, you are.
Day 1 of saying bawz on Tommy’s vids until he asks for my dc
you should start playing skyblock again. There are a ton of new stuff and content
Yippeee
Why Tommy I’ve had too many mental breakdowns today
This was not funny i cant do thisss
This actually got me emotional 😢
long live technoblade
Damn, this is honestly so sad
Thank God
I love how he used Celeste music during the dragon fight
The fact that when the video ended I got the video when he joined dream smp      Dream smp is so historical to me and it was apart of my childhood I will always cherish those moments
Goodbye Dream SMP. This was honestly the most I’ve ever watched a server and i wouldn’t give anything for it. All of Dream’s plots, Tommy’s laughter, Technoblade’s everything and so much more. I just want to say a final thank you and I honestly wish that nothing ever taints my memory of this as it was my favourite lockdown memory.  Goodbye Dream SMP. I’ll miss you.
:( sweet and sour. it feels like sm of our lives as viewers have changed bc of this too thank you to everyone
I almost cried
Dream Smp changed my life, it showed me how Amazing techno and tommy are, and how overrated dream actually is.
You should put every dream smp video into a memory playlist
I can't believe I've been here since the beginning 😭
if only techno was here
DreamSmp was my everything for soo long, I am very sad that it is now over, but I am forever grateful that it happened. Thank you for everything, I will probably never forget this time, this server or even this comunity! <3
technos base broke me
I was sobbing when he went to Techno's house. SO many memories. o7 King.
I'm grateful to have found the DSMP and be introduced to you and so many other content creators. Thank you for the fun times. ❤
I can't believe its actually over. Thank you everyone on the smp for entertaining us during covid. These were amazing memories.
Man Dream SMP has been the only thing I ever watched throughout my life my past hasn’t been the greatest so everytime smh happened I came straight to YouTube to watch dream and whoever else they always made me smile and laugh but honestly I’m now so upset that it’s over
And now, ladies and gentlemen! Dream SMP Season 2 will come out!
I was literally crying when he visited Techno's house
Thank you, tommy, for all the memories. Honestly the dream smp raised me and I couldn’t thank you more for the years of content. (My tributes to l’manburg). ( will you still post on the other acc like Tom and the shorts channel?) Goodbye, everyone, I wish you all well.
11:01  just click it for no reason and go 12:45 so
aw, it's the end.. at least I was able to watch it grow, but all good things must come to an end.
when i tell u the defintion of milking the series. like damn bro let this goofy ass shit die already bro damn.
I am still waiting for technoblade to randomly log on to the server after 12 years That is if they didnt delete the server...
o7 tommy and dream smp, in the span of one year we lost two huge parts of our childhood, and i can’t wait to see what’s next.
Its so saddddd!!
The only thing is …  What comes next ? 😊
The past almost 3 years were the best thanks to this server :) thank you for everything <3
finally
I cried when I saw techno chest with the discs I feel techno place that for Tommy on his last day on earth may you rest king o7 😭
the smp kept me entertained for years i hope they will continue to make great content
The techno part almost made me cry
Never thought I would be in this much tears seeing techno’s house again. o7 blood god and o7 dream smp thank you for all of the laughs and all of the cries from the lmanburg war when I first started watching your streams to the very end. o7 I’m really gonna miss this.
I will now have to find something to fill in the hours I would watch Tommy and Tubby streaming the Dream SMP.
it was so emotional...im gonna miss the dream smp sm...
At 17:25 I'm sceanshotting cuz that's just amazing
I’m really gonna miss those old days. The wake ups to the Dream SMP recap channel videos, the old streams, and the lore and funny moments. Goodbye Dream SMP. I hope this new upcoming SMP shares some good new memories for us
😢
"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened"
Thank you for adding in the Technoblade part I cried a lot
you don't know you're in the good old days until you're out of them :')  goodbye dream smp, you changed my life. thank you. <3
gg dream smp.
It’s the end of an era😔 hopefully we get to see it again. One day a new server will take over. And the statue of the dream SMP members will be on it. Technoblade never dies.

Amen

2:21 Animal Farm moment
Now make a tommy or any other name smp
Dsmp has changed my life, i remember joining in on the fun when tommy joined it he was the FIRST EVER streamer i watched, i countinue to watch all the cute, funny, scary animations and clips everyone is in and im so happy to say that this was part of my childhood. i started at 10-11 and im now 14 almost 15... i cried so much abt techno he was one of my favorite people, a comfort person i would go to after school even if he didnt make videos alot or stream much pfft-- anyways, its sad knowing he missed it but i also know hes probably watching all his friends happily act like nerds. Im so god damn proud of tommy aswell for how far he has come hes so funny and im so excited to see how he continues to do. Anyways sorry for the long ass comment but i really just wanted to leave one because im just so happy.     also to the whole fandom: WHO GAVE YOU GUYS PERMISSON TO BE SO COOL? like your animations, drawings, paintings etc are just so awsome! you guys have so much talent i wish i had.   To future events: Because of these amazing people im going to start youtube i just know it. but im way to shy now and just dont have the confidence but ik that it will help me even if i dont suceed... and to everyone that wants to do the same or needs a friend i am here because honestly i am lonely.  GOODBYE BITCHES! o7
o7
As someone who watched the L'manberg Election live, this was a really good way to end it.
WAIT! DOES THAT MEAN THERE IS NO "Dream SMP Season 2"!?!?!?
Dream smp was the best thing,it changed many lives including mine
Wait isn’t there another season
Goodbye DreamSMP
Goodbye for the last time. This was my childhood. Technoblade never dies. o7
I never thought I would cry while watching a Tommyinnit video.
I almost fucking cried when you visited technos place I was gonna sob so hard bro😢
Bottom text - tommyinnit (2:45
I love youuuuuu
It's the end of a generation boys 😢
Never thought id be in tears during a Tommyinnit video unless it was in laughter. That Techno segment got me
Wait is this the last thing you will ever make or just on the dsmp
This smp was perfect.
o7 techno
Let's cryyy
Wait this is the very very very last Tommy innit video😢😢😢😢😢😢
I don't usually cry when watching things, and I never really kept up with the DreamSMP, but man. This video hit something in me. Especially the visit to Techno's cabin.  RIP DreamSMP, and Technoblade o7
The nostalgia just makes me feel so good especially after all these years...
I cried when they went to Techno’s house I won’t even lie
I honestly strated crying doing the wholesome bit
I didn't watch the Dream SMP that often, but maybe now I'd like to go back in time and watch them all, get hyped with its highs, sad with its lows, and pretend like I'm on an adventure with them, too. Life goes on though, and as the sun goes down once and for all, so will those long late night streams full of laughing and explosions. Thank you all, and even though it played only a small part of my life, I'll make sure to never forget the Dream SMP. Who knows, maybe something even more exciting is to come. Cheers to the past, to the present, and to the future. 🥂
Thank you for the memories Dream SMP. I couldn’t be more grateful to the group of people who inspired me to get back into my childhood and embrace my dream to make content again. I’ll miss you always Techno… and thank you for changing all our lives everyone.
brooo im on the ending be like be a plot twist and restart the series bust as it is folks "EVERY GOOD THING HAS AN END"🙂🙂

2:45 bottom text

it was a long one.
I didn't think the end of something would make time freeze so much, after this video ended I sat there for 15 minutes just staring, no tears.. it felt Content. I will miss this series, and i want to thank everyone in it for getting me through the hardest points in my life. Keep being amazing Tommy, and technoblade, never stop fighting god, forever. Rest in peace, lmanburg, and all those lost. ❤
When i saw thechnoblades house i cried bc he died and bc the tommy smp is over😢😢😢
😢😢😢 this means the world to so many people thanks for all the creators who made the wonderful memories for their fans
Lol cool 😎😎😎
The dreamsmp did so much for me and so many others, it's the best experience I've ever had. It's sad that it has to come to an end, but I mean all good things must come to an end eventually. Thank you dreamsmp ♥️
I honestly wanted at some point to become apart of this but now it will never happen. Thanks for the good memories
I cried watching this. The Dream SMP got me through COVID, it honestly changed my life and I’ll miss it but I’m so happy I got to watch streams and lores
Really am gonna miss it. It’s been a part of my life since day 1. Alex/techno was my favourite not because we have the same name, but because his humour and friendliness
Breaking into Techno‘s house, raiding his boxes, ringing the bell, sending people to buy his merch. He would be proud of you. 🥲
All these memories <3 I'm glad I was here and enjoyed all of it o7 goodbye<33
End of an era, wow.
16:42 is my favorite part... Dream Smp changed my life! Adn i was here to see all of it. Im happy it happened and sad it has to go. Thank you for changing a lot of poeple lives!!!!!!!!
I was not there to witness the smp from the start, but I'm really glad to see all of the member's journey through this server.
MY HEART 😭😭😭😭😭 THIS IS TOO SAD PLEASE GO BACK GO BACK GO BACK IN TIME PLEASE 😭😭😭😭

It’s really sad to see the Dream SMP go. I will forever love this to death and never forget all the memories and joy that it gave me.   Goodbye Dream SMP. You will be missed
Thanks for the smiles and love you gave to all of us ❤ o7
Did anyone notice that dreams voice changed a lot
o7 im gonna miss it, so long Dsmp
The end of an era o7
I don’t watch much anymore but DSMP was a pretty big part of my life for a year or so. Thought I’d check in. Thanks for the laughs, Long Live Techno
Tommy was genuinely about to cry when he was in technos house
cool :3
This hurt to watch. I'll always remember how i happy Dream SMP made me and all the fun memories it had. I'll never forget hoping on youtube to see another lore video had been posted, or a twich notification that someone was streaming. Thank you and goodbye, Dream SMP. ❤
god... to think this started with a 16 year old going to war over music discs.
make the world downloadable
12:14 R.I.P Technoblade  o7
o7
I just realized Bad Boy Halo sounds like Chris from Family Guy 😂  "Do you feel bonita?" "Yes?" "GOOD, CAUSE YOU LOOK BONITA 😁"
This helped us all through covid -19 and everything.  Thanks Tommy, thanks a ton.  We loved your content, and we always will.
Goodbye dream smp… it’s now time to move on… and start new smp….
End of a era, i hope everyone else will be carry on for our new adventures, forget about the past, be safe, be happy everyone, goodbye, dream smp...
Tommy.
seeing tommy at techno's base but with no techno made me cry
Thank you Tommy man. Dsmp really changed how I am. It's amazing to see how much has changed the past 3 years and how you grew. Thank you all for everything.
Honestly watching the stream was so surreal like part of me felt like it was mended
Hmmmm is tommyinnt reply🤔🤔
still, youre gonna make some videos?
no guys i didnt cry       (wiping my tears rn)
I am actually kinda sad to say that this was my first dream smp stream
I will miss watching dsmp 😢
NOO IT ENDED 🎉
A great man once said "Not even close, baby! Technoblade never dies". Rest in peace 🕊️
don’t be sad it’s over,  be happy it happened
What an iconic damn SMP
I don't know why, but seeing the Cat disc, in Techno's chest, really got to me, the thing that started it all. I will deeply miss this server. And the amazing work put in by everyone involved was amazing to see evolve and change.  I want to thank every single member of the Dream SMP along with the ones who couldn't attend the Final Waltz.  Skeppy, Wilbur, Philza, Quackity, Niki, Technoblade, and many more.  Thank you all for keeping me hopeful in a time of despair and loss.  Thank you for making 2020 easier.  And every year since then.  -PlanetRDC
NO IM NOT CRYING. YOU ARE!
its sad to see my fav smp and my fav mc youtuber that there will not upload vids on it
dream smp= dream Shit Massive Poop
Finally it’s over
oh tommy
The best yet saddest stream ever
10:38 WHY ARE YOU TRYNA MAKE ME FAUCITVHING CRY MAN!
When he went to technos house I thought techno would log on or smth RIP
🥲
Watching you guys on that server is what gave me a reason to still try and pursue my dreams. I'm not sad that is over, just grateful I could have had this amazing experience of watching all of this. You all folks are the best, honestly, I will never forget this ❤
This was upsetting to watch. Honestly, you guys have made probably thousands of people's lives by this one server, including mine. This is how I discovered you. I love the Dream SMP, but, now we have to see it go. Thank you for making this content for us. Thank you for making the past two and a half years of our lives. Thank you for everything. Long live the Dream SMP. <3
Couldn’t have asked for a better finale. Goodbye Dream SMP. But most importantly goodbye to Technoblade. The man we all miss but happy he came along. We will miss this server. But unfortunately all good things come to an end. But in the end it was truly meant to be.
My new favorite Tommy quote: just killed a gogy, feeling good!
The Dream smp has honestly been a huge parts of my life, there were some days so stressful that it was the only thing keeping me from going insane. No matter how bad my days were just sitting down and watching them all laugh together just made my day infinitely better, I have so memories from this huge part of my life and I can’t possibly imagine ever forgetting them, I will always cherish these memories deep inside my heart, so thank you, Thank you Tommy, and thank you Dream, thank you Tubbo and Ranboo, and Techno and Phil, thank you Niki and Hannah, and thank you Wilbur and Eret, thank you Sam and thank you Ant, thank you Bad and Skeppy, and thank you Punz and Ponk, thank you Puffy, and Fundy and Jack, thank you Sapnap and George and thank you Karl and Quakity, thank you for always making me laugh, and for always being an inspiration, and lastly, thank you for changing my life, forever
Technoblade never dies
If is second Time u post it
Just beautiful. This server means more to me than I can explain. I had a similar server during Covid that was inspired off of this and it changed me forever as a person. I’m eternally grateful for you and everyone else in the Dream SMP. To new beginnings!
The moment I saw techno’s cabin I started crying I just know that he’s so proud of you tommy
2:36 he f*cked up.
o7
‘s been a big part of my teenage years, cheers!
Thank you so much for all of this Tommy. We all had an amazing time coming and living through this time, from the ones who only joined recently, to the ones who’ve been here since the very first day. The Dream SMP truly was an experience, and I’ll never EVER be ashamed to have been here. I’d like to think that that disc at Techno’s house was the actual disc, and he switched one of them out because he knew something would happen. This video was funnily chaotic, but also really sad, and I’m glad I got to be here to live out even the smallest bits of the Dream SMP. Thank you all. For everything
Thanks for all the amazing vids to watch during the lockdown this server and its memories were amazing
I’m not crying you’re crying I didn’t cry until I saw the he walked through techno’s house
Finally oh my god
finaly
a
Now that it’s over, maybe my dad will come back
Why did the end make me cry
;0;
NOOOO, my childhood... I, dont know what to say. Memories are flooding my head right now and I can't help but cry, does this mean no more content?? 😭
It was awesome but is there anyway to watch the complete version?
A great ending to a great story thank you for making this story as great an memorable as it was
this gave me chills
The sad thing is techno wont be on the server for the last time
I loved dream smp and I still do. I feel like it's a part of me. o7. You will be missed dream SMP.
My stepdad’s daughter went to the same collage as Tommy and their the same age and my stepdad told me before my mum broke up w him I can’t believe he didn’t tell my earlier 😂 I was shocked
dream smp helped me in so many ways, this video made me tear up especially technos house. Thank you for everything, Dream smp will forever hold a place in my heart o7
I was there for it live.. wow it was amazing! ❤
I am crying it's so sad the memories and evryting the DSMP will be in my heart😥😥😥😥
Holy Jesus the fact that you went to his house and rang the bell just oh my gosh everything just dropped it was so sweet and loving and cute. honestly I've been watching you guys for ever and I love everything that you guys do and it's absolutely amazing.  Every one of you guys are amazing and how much you guys have an in packing on every single subscriber is out of this world you guys literally bring everybody joy and happiness I don't even think you all know that. Keep doing what you do you're amazing at it Tommy!!!!!!! Techno never dies!!!!!!!!!!!
And to let you know it almost birthday in April 27 2011 and I’m 11 I will be 12 on my birthday 🥳
dram smp and you in particular, tommy, made my memories sweet, this was the only source of happiness i had during covid(aka you guys kept me alive), u guys played a very big part molding me...THANK YOU GUYS....I LOVE DSMP...🥹
I am sad that this has come to an end, you and tubbo really made me happy everytime i see you both together. For the past 2 years i've been watching every videos you did and have, DreamSMP was a part of me and you were too.. Its sad to see DreamSMP go but, good things come to an end don't they? Atleast i still can watch all of your videos and the memories will not be forgotten by people. You are a wonderful man, enjoy your life king.
I watched tommy and other people in the dream smp its been great but someday i know it will end and it is today i am so sad 😭❤. I even cried typing this i guess this is the end of the dream smp  Goodbye
fucking finally
I am-         Not
4:09 that's low-key so sinister. just swap out $ex for 'it' and you have the beginning of a horror map/book/movie/anything
…I’m either going to say something really happy sad or like really fucking dark so I’m just gonna shut it I loved this smp so much
❤
I’m sad
THIS MADE ME CRY B1TCH. i love you guys <3
I can believe its already over, the DreamSMP videos have always made me laugh even in the bad days. I got pretty emotional during this video, especially when you went to Techno’s cabin and at the end with the sunset and Tubbo. Thank you and the DreamSMP so much for these past few years, I hope all goes well in the future, and this past will never be forgotten. :)
rip dream smp
Tommy has w rizz fr tho
Why does dream sound like this
Cool :)
o7
Seeing the DreamSMP go from something pretty cool that a lot of different people enjoyed to a server with a "weird" fanbase was a wild journey. At some point I stopped watching because I didn't want to become one of those cringey fans. But after about a year and a half of not touching the DreamSMP and seeing this video, it really made me realize how amazing this server is.  At the end of the day I'm just another random viewer, but I'm grateful for being able to be here from the start to the end of the server. Also, fly high Technoblade. Even after I stopped watching the SMP I still enjoyed his videos and all the memories he made. o7
end of an era
i've never watched the dsmp streams or technoblade, but seeing him go through technos house made me tear up
The dream smp changed my life forever. It genuinely broke my heart watching that last stream. I’m glad we got a full ending and it didn’t just disappear. Thank you guys for everything you’ve done. This was my favorite thing for nearly 3 years. Thank you dream smp
LOL
07
Wow. Just... wow.  I started watching the DSMP around August of 2020. It was right when the L'Manburg war ended and the Pogtopia arc was right around the corner. I remember how I watched the Tommy and Tubbo vs Dream stream - the final battle (of sorts) - and how I screamed so loudly when moments got hype. I was invested that my brother had to come into my room like "are you okay??" from how much I was screaming from excitement.   I remember all the good times and the bad times attached to this SMP in my own personal life. When Technoblade died, my brother had died a month prior, so Techno's death hit really hard. I miss both of them so much, even though I didn't personally know one of them.   I've since then stopped really following DSMP content and have started focusing on other things, but looking back will always give me a sense of nostalgia. Tommy and the others made something special with this SMP - the stories and the characters were so engaging and no one ever truly felt like the good guy. People would argue over who was in the right and ultimately, I think that's how you know you created something complex and amazing.   And even though I hated how Tommy's story on the SMP ended, I can never forget the 2 and a half years of joy and tears and sanity this server brought me.   Thank you.
This is sad....
what a wild ride
Tommy: I have never ever cried on stream. Also Tommy: Visits Techno's base 😭
"There's a woman in my game" LMAO
all good things come to an end eventually. here's to all the memories we made and all the new ones coming our way!  with all the love in my heart: goodbye dream SMP
leaving a comment just for the sake of it- i got into the dsmp right in the beginning of Jan 2021 (because i already knew skeppy, bbh, and techno). i know i missed out on a lot and what i call the "prime" of the story. and i know it was dying out slowly, especially the last year or so. the dsmp gave me motivation to do the things i lost passion for (art, music). and this silly series and group of people gave me a source of joy during a weird time in my life. i daydreamt of this server and making my own self-inserted characters that were clearly extensions of my own issues. im still in that weird time in my life. it sucks that even the distractions that help ground me never stay the same.       there's a lot of things i still dont know- about the creators and the full lore because i never binge-watched the streams or became full-fledged obsessed with all the creators. i can't keep up with everyone and everything, and i dont have people in the community to keep me in check. and i still have questions; is the server shutting down?; are we still gonna see these people together in streams? i think things are prettier in the past but i can't help but feel sad that i've watched so much change over such a little span of time. everyone's growing, moving out, having relationships, careers thriving. i've changed too, and for some reason its upsetting. i know there are new things ahead of us, but i still feel like i lost something. though i lost interest in the smp (and this side of youtube), i hate that a part of me is still hopeful that maybe it really isnt over.       i can't fix any of this, but thank you. for everything. im glad that it happened, and im glad that we are doing things that make us happy, even if they aren't always the same things. o7 to this server. and even more, a teary eyed o7 to techno, who was there from before i knew of this server. <3
At the end of the video, it showed me a video it recommends i watch. The first ever dream smp video tommyinnit did. Goodbye, Dream SMP<3
Technoblade never dies
Man, this server of people has taught me so much in life. I remember the first ever dream smp stream I ever watched. I newly discovered dream and his YouTube videos, and found out he made more videos on this app called “twitch” so, I downloaded it, made an account, and saw that he was live at the time. I clicked on it and it turned out to be his version of deal or no deal and tommy and Tubbo were both part of it. I remember tommy trying to cheat the gameshow anyway he could and tubbo amazed in how many McDonald’s happy meals he could buy. That’s how I discovered everybody. I remember when Karl was first added and the first stream him and Sapnap did together where Karl was mining in a ravine most the time. I remember everytime someone broke character during lord streams. I remember discovering MCC and getting so excited to cheer on my favorite people. I remember when everyone started branching out into different games like among us and phasmophobia. I remember the Jack box streams where you could never catch your breath because of all of the pandering. I remember hearing Wilbur released a song called “your new boyfriend” and listening to it and realizing I already knew the chorus from watching that one clip and then playing the 24 hour version every night before bed. I remember when everybody started to make their own music and it was the only stuff I listened to. I remember everybody starting to make blogs because it was safe in the world again and everybody was ready to do stuff. I remember loving all of technos content because it was so undeniably funny. I remember sitting on my camp bed and looking through social media and clicking on technos video only to find out he had passed. I remember Dream saying he was gonna face reveal and not believing it like every other time until he did. I remember dream team finally meeting up like they had always planned. I remember almost every single thing I’ve seen from these cc’s. And the best thing is, it’s not over. And the past is till all there and there’s still more to come. This place brought me so much needed happiness in my life, and even though it’s over, that happiness is still there. And it will still be there because this place opened me up to the rest of this beautiful community that I’m so happy to be apart of. I love you all, you are my people. 💜 - A person from Chat
i cried when watching the stream
i'm at a loss for words. i might have only joined the dsmp fandom in the middle of 2021, but i enjoyed every second of it. the only thing i can manage to say is, thank you.
Yea I hate the dream smp bring on season 2
dreamsmp was the first actual fandom i joined during covid, it was my beacon of hope, i was there during the very beging of lmanburg, and i truly miss it and ill miss all of the happiest moments of dreamsmp and i could just go back and rewatch it all. i know next season wont be the same without technoblade, but i think he will be happy how it ended. and i miss it. and.... ill miss it all and ill stay around till the very end. this is pogchamps, poggers and this is technoblade out.
o7
Thank god.
4:27 pause
It has been a pleasure to enjoy the entropic symphony that was this server. o7 miss it already
Noooooo you were  my best YouTuber and you are gonna leave YouTube 😢 pls don’t stop
cant believe its gone.
cool

Thank fucking god
Technoblade never dies.
Wait wait wait tommyinnit you will make more content with the people from dream smp right? The dsmp has ended but you will continue making content once in a while with the dsmp people right??? Right?????
My la-manburg
Lamanbug
Tommy:*posts this video* Me:*knowing that I will get sad at some point of the video* 11:10  😢
Not me absolutely sobbing when he visited Techno's cabin <3
This video even though it had some sad moments because of techno it was still one of the funniest videos I’ve watched in a while
I miss techno but he will be known a god!😥
Goodbye DreamSMP :/
Thank you, guys, so much. You really saved my life and I will never forget this server and these happy moments on the internet.
this actually made me cry espessualy Techno Blade house so f sad phil and wiilbur wasnt there
o7
bro today i lost my disscord acc and now this why thinks are getting sadder and sadder?(idk how to type sadder)
Good bye dream smp
I joined in really late and literally only watched about... 3 lore streams, but I still feel attached to this SMP, so I'm sad to see it go. I hope that, someday, there will be another DreamSMP, another great story to enjoy.
Thank you so so much for all of the streams on the dream smp the best moments of my life good bye dream smp techno never dies
DSMP changed half of my life for the past two years i remember the days whenever there's an stream or vid immediately watch it even tho sometimes i alr need to sleep rather than watching something from the internet im gonna miss my dmsp phase thanks for everything
Miss ya Techno. Thanks Tommy
I didn't even really watch nor be involved in any lore and or the dream smp but this was heartbreaking to see it go cause it's like that background music while your doing something(motivation) and when it's gone you just kinda stop 😕 and think "What now?" ~~~
The best part of this is when he goes to techno and phil’s house and the song “comforting memories” plays o7
Why is it going away?
Goodbye 👋
Goodbye.
Just kill the gogee feeling good😁👍
Well goodbye dream smp
4:24  goofy ahh face
Is there gonna be a season 2?
The end genuinely warmed my heart im so glad i found tommy's videos.
ggs boys
E
19 on trending for gaming? Should be 1 easily
This video had me in tears, man!!! Great job.
Idea! what if you guys open the server for people to play on freely and look around (just look around not be able to break or place stuff)
Thank you..
as dream once said "Don't cry because it's over smile because it happened
This video was awesome man. Thank you all for everything you guys did over the past 2 and a half years. Farewell Dream SMP.  o7
technoblade house hit diferent
techno o7
Damn, it's been such a long time, so many great adventures, but everything must come to an end.
CAN SOMEONE MENTION THE CHANGE IN DREAMS VOICE???
10:58  just   I love this
is tommy gonna quit uploading or is it just the dream smp that hes not uploading videos on it anymore
I think it’s safe to say this video marked the end of an age for many 😭🥹
From 2018 - 2023 it all have been good years he is all grown up now he got a girlfriend a great life great friends but some stuff needs to end even if it could go on we all have come so far from Channelnutpig to the one we knew today the lore has ended the war also but the love-hate relationship for this fandom will still be alive thank you every single people that has been with them from years because of you guys THIS FANODM  has grown SO MUCH and I'm very sure if technoblade was here he would be screaming with joy THANK YOU TO EVERY DSMP MEMBER for being there for us and entertaining us for years since we were young now some of us may have entered college, high school but still watches this fandom now that's all from me I am still watching this fandom this video has been a rollercoaster of emotion that is all from me Im sure some fans out there watching this video cried and laughs it has been very WONDERFUL FANTASTIC AMAZING just to be apart of this journey once again THANK YOU ALL FOR THE PEOPLE THAT SUPPORTS THEM THROUGH THIS WHOLE JOURNEY..that is all from me goodbye..
Kinda wish this wasn't the end.
Best ❤
It’s the most wholesome thing, tubbo and tommy started this together, and they ended it together. ❤
sheeesh why the last😢 i watch dream smp   since i was a kid know im a teenager watching still here watching you 😢❤
I've never laughed or cried harder on the Dream SMP until today.   I may not have been there for the whole journey, but I was able to catch a few streams, and those I will always remember.  I could honestly say so much right now on how it helped me through the toughest times or how it helped me bond with friends, but I'm sure it's been all said and done before. Thank you, Dream SMP, and all the people in it.  You are amazing.
Man when you went to techno’s home that hit hard man… we all will miss him but never forget about him…
After seeing the youtube title, i almost cried. 2 years in the dream SMP led to this.
o7
Tommy's last glance at the camera before he jumped into the portal hit me so hard, Dream SMP was my life.
Is there a season 2???
Go bye
Even though I wasn't in it, this server had such an impact on my life and I will never forget the memories that came from it. The laughs, the tears, those will never leave me. This server gave me life during covid and I really hate to see it go. That you for all that you've done in this server, Tommy. I thank the entire Dream SMP for all the good times we had together, and I wish them all goodbye.  Thank you Tommy.
Not even a huge dsmp fan but I watched some of the early stuff and this is sad
4:26 Now that is the face of a mad man who wants to blow stuff up👀
i'm so glad it's finally over
dream smp was and still is the best thing thats hapened to me,i have to say, goodbye DreamSMP
…
NO don’t let it end 😢
I Don't give a shit this is the last dream smp video
But still gonna watch tommy's videos.
This video encapsulates both the chaotic fun and emotional moments of the DSMP-- thanks for a wonderful finale, Tommy :)
So I might be wrong or right but is this your last video or the last dreamSMP video?
It's sad that this is came to an end.😢🙃🖐️😭😞 I really gonna miss it.
Im gonna cry im legit gonna cry
The dream  got me thorough some of the hardest times of my life. I'm sad to see it go. I would like to thank everyone who was a part of it and everyone who couldn't make it. And too techno who is a hero in my heart for making me laugh during some of the hardest times of my life. I'd like to thank everybody on the dream smp.  Thank you for giving us this. amazing experience  Goodbye dream, smp. we'll miss you       This is moth signing off.
this video made me so emotional, especially technos base and tommy saying “this is what he would’ve wanted” that made me sob. i’m gonna miss the server but massive thank you to you and all of the dsmp for changing my life for the better and helping me get through hard times in these past 2 and a half years, even if you wasn’t live <3  o7 DreamSMP
I cried.  Especially at technos part 😭 this was such an emotional video
This is definitely going to be tye starr of the end of this generation of youtube, all these youtubers are going to fade into obscurity, into youtube heaven, with dantdm, thinknoodles, and the rest of the greats of the last generation.
2:45 - me when bottom text
Nooooooooooooo
who gave me the right to cry right now? absolutley criminal
I wanna say something poetic but I can’t think of anything.  Buy Techno merch, subscribe to Tommyinnit I guess, and cherish the good, the bad and the incredibly insane. RIP DSMP.
That final look into the camera at 16:16 can push anyone to tears
I watched the VOD of this, A.K.A the actual recorded stream. 2 hrs of sadness
technoblade never dies *sobs silently*

The best 3 years of my life. Thank you for everything. o7 Goodbye DreamSMP
The fact that when I joined this fandom two years ago, I thought it would never end. That I would always have streams to watch of it at the end of the month to be ready for the next one.. How I will miss this, thank you guys so much for everything you did, and o7, blood god.
What if technoblade made something on the dream SMP server he wants you guys to find
I literally cried during this video :')
“I’m the main character!”  I thought Techno said RANBOO is the main character
6:27 bro banned himself
this was such a meaningful chunk of my teenage years id been watching wilbur and tommy and techno since i was about 11-12, just before my 13th birthday when covid started i fell in love with the dream smp and all its creators and artists and im now 17 and still really proud of all of this but im sad to see it go even though i understand it wasnt a forever thing.  thank you for this and rest in peace and power technoblade. may you feel happy looking over your friends and what they achieved with you and learnt from you
Goodbye, DreamSMP.

It’s so sad that techno couldn’t have been here to watch the end. O7
BRO I CRUED
I cried... a lot Especially for the one and only techno.
technoblade is the main character, not u
It’s sad how he was holding back tears once he was just admiring everything. And just made jokes to keep on making the video and making content for us.
Sad to see it go but it’s been a good 2 years
The day I've been waiting for
Thank you for the memories, the good ones, the bad ones, the happiness and the grief, thank you, Tommy.
Why did he make a part three to how to sex 😂😂😂😂😂😂
This made me really emotional I love the good memories In the dsmp and of course technoblade never dies 👑 Just kill a gogy filling good 😊 15:53 tommy blew up dream :0 16:15 the fact the tommy looks at the camera and smiles got me on he floor crying 😆 17:16 one last sunset

RIP Dream SMP
It was almost like yesterday when the dream SMP server was just made 🙂
GOD SPEED TOMMYINNIT😔
Didnt know Tommy could make me cry.. 😢😢
This made me tear up. There has just been soo many memories, its unbelievable that the dream smp is actually ending. Being in this fandom has truly been a fun time that I will never forget<3
Why did tubbo have to get the dragon tf
o7
rip tb
Good bye dream smp
Dream SMP was one of the things that always made me happy during covid and all that stuff and not get bored i would watch you guys all the time back then but now seeing how it end just makes me sad but still im very happy
if only techno was here to kill the enderdragon and rap it all up
This as sended me shivers

It just randomly said "bottom text" after Tommy fled bc of killing a bee near tubbo
Hooray 🎉
good bye dream smp for being a part of my life  techno blade never dies
o7
O7 fellas :)
damn
Honestly, this was a very nice send off to the server. I really liked all the clips and screenshots you added on that last bit. Looking foward to your next proyects, and of course, o7 for Techno.
thank you everyone, it’s so amazing to have been a part of this even just as a viewer
I cried when I saw that Techno left the disc there for Tommy to find😭
WHY DID TOMMY LOOK AT THE CAMERA BEFORE JUMPING IN THE PORTAL
o7
whats the song at the end
sad
THANKS TOMMY❤
Rip technoblade when you went in his house you could tell it was emotional for everyone
2:31 why tf did he say is it instead of innit
I started watching when the independence war was happening and I could not be more grateful for everything.  This server made me into who I am today. I am sad it ended but I'm happy it happened
Стало так тепло на душе, спасибо дрим смп, спасибо всем, спасибо тебе Томми
It's so sad
Techno might have not been here to the finale but deep inside our hearts he is with them but we just can't see I'm
The end of an era.
we love u man
I might just cry- anyways thank you all for the amazing memories and I hope to see more amazing videos and streams in the future! Again thank you all for the memories!
DONT LEAVE! YOU HAVE MORE TO LIVE FOR
I now hate u , for no apparent reason
Thanks for the memories
Dream SMP was my childhood! Also the hotel part was OMG XD
It's funny when Tommy says he never cries but he did when he visited techno. R.I.P Technoblade
This is a video where all the Men Cried
Tom bom what have you done i wanted to join the smp please i have 6 subs please tell dream to remake it
Damn
Such a great finale. So many memories and emotions tied to this server that I’ll never forget. I didn’t think those few moments at Technos were going to hit as hard as they did
If not for the Dream SMP i might have never discovered most of the creators on the server. Techno, Tommy, Wilbur, Phil, and Schlatt. Without the Dream SMP i might have never known about any of them. And that would be such a loss. An entire world of entertainers and communities that i would have never seen.
Goodbye dsmp!
This was so surreal. Love you so much, this server changed my life forever <3
Thank you for all the the good times and memories <3
The video was so good I was crying 😭😭😭😭
This server, these streams, these people. They saved my life and i'll forever be grateful. Thank you for the memories, and goodbye Dsmp. o7
"Don't be sad that its over, Smile an be happy that it has happened." -Dr Seuss.
i first joined when Jschlatt fell out of the world, like exactly at that moment, and now its time to say goodbye to the smp:/ Time Well Spent.
o7
Goodbye, L’Manberg.
For Technoblade
That eerie mouse click at the end
thank you for everything dream smp <3
I smiled at this the entire time
discovered the dream smp a few months ago and I really wish i discovered it sooner. this was really fun to watch while it still lasted.
In my heart I know it’s over but my head won’t believe it… Dream SMP was the best of the best and seeing and hearing that it’s over it’s just… the Techno Cabin, the Prime path… all the memories that will never be forgotten…
The Dream SMP will forever be a core memory in my life.   I remember being exited to watch Tommy's streams every evening and letting the hours fly by without even realising it! The amount of times I genuinely laughed out loud to myself was more than any other content I’ve watched online. I don’t want to risk sounding parasocial, but I’m sure all of us viewers at some point felt as if we were PART of the Dream SMP through our little screens haha. I have literally WATCHED Tommy grow up through this server! Although all of it was just "content", it doesn’t change the fact there was genuine growth and development through all the time spent on this server. Real, beautiful friendships and connections were made on the Dream SMP, and you can’t fake that!   This final video is very bitter sweet for me, as I know it had to end at some point, and the magic of what made theDream SMP in the first place can’t be replicated. However, I’m grateful it happened! (Although they won’t read this) I would still like to thank all of the members of the Dream SMP for everything they have done, I loved every minute of it!  Oh and one last thing! Technoblade… there will never be anyone else like you. You were one of a kind. Intelligent, caring, funny, it’s rare for one human being to have all of these traits, but you did. Thinking about you not being here anymore still gives me a pit in my stomach. You were loved more than you ever knew, and you’ll always be missed. o7  Anyway, I’ve already written way too much, so I’ll end it here. Thank you, for everything  :’)
This is such a wholesome video in the strangest way
It's so sad to see my favorite SMP go, R.I.P. Techno, even though you're gone, I'll still appreciate you and remember you.
Im crying
It was a pleasure knowing about this Tommy you made generations and generations happy
Good.
No last smp vidieo
I started watching the dream amp quite late on, probably just over a year ago, but this server has made so many iconic moments that will always be remembered. Thank you, and goodbye Dream SMP.
Tommy are you sad that technoblade died
its too bad that they couldn't end it with techno
The second the dream smp is over thats the second you know covid is over
it was just ok
Who knows.. Maybe a New World is gonna appear
NOOOOO!!!!’ 😭😭😭😭😭
Only one emoji    😖
damn i got emotional
o7
2:45 "Bottom Text."
Does anyone know when a public copy of the server is out?
Eeeee
the amount of nostalgia i am getting rn
I will always remember
o7
Finnaly, something calm... And something we pog people can remember forever
what a legendarry ending
Thinking about the old days, it's like a fever dream. I have so many memories about Dream SMP that I will cherish forever. Tommy, thank you for making this video, giving me a chance to look back on the past. I'm looking forward to our future.
I cried. ❤
DREAM SMP 2.0?!?!?!
Rest in peace Techno.....
best vid ever
At 13:00 he hit his table and for some reason I felt that
Still I can't believe that DSMP one of the things that took one of the biggest parts of my heart and my childhood is now over. The thing that was comforting me in my worst period of childhood, the thing that made me feel so many emotions. It improved my personality so so much in a good way. It feels just like yesterday when for the first time I've watched SAD-ist's animation videos and was so interested in it, even I didn't knew English and I wasn't understanding the most of it. It's so hard to say goodbye but I'm so glad that I was here laughing and crying with all of you and now we should move on. I hope there will be so many interesting things in the future.  I want to say thank you to every DSMP member (except for Jack Manifold hehe nah just joking thank you so much also to him) and the people that made these amazing stuff like animations and songs. THANK YOU to everyone for these unforgettable memories and of course TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES ❤! P.S. And sorry for my English and if I'm wrong somewhere correct me. But if there wasn't DSMP I most likely would not able to write this at all, so thank you again for teaching me English and goodbye. Hope you're okay wherever you are. See you in the new chapter of life.
only if technoblade was there
Bye bye dream smp    Technoblade never dies.
“One last sunset” I cried
what are you going to do now?
wat was the ip
Cried 😭
Why does dream sound like he just hit puberty??
I suppose that since the smp was such a massive part of my life, I should comment on it. The SMP got me through some of my toughest times in high school, and even helped me make great experiences! I ran for the president of a club with a friend and both of us had Lmanburg pins and suits, and I got the presidency! I’ve had so many good times with others because of this server and this story, and the people that ran it. I could never thank you enough, o7
😢😢😢
I loved this, this makes me really sad as I love the dream smp and this is the last video you will ever make on it. I’m really going to miss it. You all made me so happy!!
I'm confused he quit youtube???
Wow can't belive it :) Dream smp was a big part of my life tbh..But i got into kpop...and finding this vid again is such an honor :) Goodbye dream smp goodbye
this was beautiful, i remember being so invested in this
So much respect for going to technos cabin, but he didn’t go to the uh room with the prison plans or what ever it was called
Im not crying you are 😢
When he visited Techno's house I got chills man
i just want sadist to animate the part where he went to technos house
so emotional
this fells so nostalgic omg (:
best vid ive ever seen. laughing to sobbing to laughing again, the dream smp will forever be a part of anyone who got the pleasure of seeing it. rest in peace dsmp and Technoblade.
It’s strange to think that it’s over
Miss you Techno <3
o7
For killing the dragon Tommy, Techno would be proud o7.
Rip Dream SMP and Technoblade the legend, you both will be missed 😢😢
hopefully therell be another smp
It has been an honour being able to watch such a legacy. I’m so grateful, just, thanks. Really, thanks.
WARR ISSSS OVERRRRR 💀💀💀🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
Guess this is my final pog 07
That made me so emotional
I actually cried when he visited technoblade's cabin
2:45 ah yes, bottom text
Omg i cried so much😢😭
Can't believe it ended
bruh
Tbh i was getting bored of the drsmp, but now i want to watch it again. So please make a season 2 and restart
The end of an era.  o7 <3
The goosebumps... Oh god this was some great time. Thank you everyone for this great SMP It was great fun watching it o7 Techno GGWP and last of all... I WAS HERE
"Don't be sad it's over, be happy it happened."   Thank you for all the memories o7
This was an awesome journey, Watching you play with everyone in the SMP was so cool. Spending your last moments with members of the SMP, this made me really happy. I'm grateful for everything you did Tommy. You always make your fans smile.  You will never be forgotten. Fly high Techno!
Nice
я плачу.  спасибо за все.  thanks for everything, Tommy.  you and your streams has been the best thing that's happened to me in the last two years.
It is such an amazing adventure when were in the drean SMP, i laughed i cried, mixed emotions got to me, but right now i'm happy cause it happened to me.  Good bye dream SMP.
Dream smp will always be remembered as the Lore of The Greatest people ever. 1). Technoblade 🌙 . ✨ 2). (*The rest of the smp*)
This is so sad :(
I was there when it started. And I am sad to say that I am also there when it ended.
Very cool
i will miss this verry bad
Imagine rebuild a base just to abandon it forever
o7 Technoblade
dream smp rules
Holy shit
The final look in the end 16:15 Was so emotional😢
oh man i almost cried
O7
o7
POGGERS!!!!!

RIP techno
Missing Technoblade 😢
I seriously hope the Sadist makes an animation of this... o7 - best years, Techno will never Die.
So is he finished uploading
Weak
When he visited technos cabin I just started crying this smp these people where the only thing that made me lauph and when they all killed the dragon I got really sad bc I didnt wnt it to end....but it was going to end at one point so thank you dsmp you've got a place in many peoples hearts you always have
have I seen this video before ?
when Tubs killed the dragon i was fulll of exitement but as i saw Tommy walking into the end portal my smile just faded away dream smp was a huge part of my covid life and even after that it ending just gives me tears
Let's start a beginning rather than a memory
Tommy SMP for 5 seconds
tommy i luv u so much ur the best youtuber that i found i just love u and u can watch ur own videos as a reminder from the dream smp.
i hope in the future there will be a dream smp season 2
how to ban yourself step 1 be tommyinnit and be an idiot :)
Noooooooooooooooo!  This was the best thing EVER! I can't believe it's just GONE!
o7
Aw well that was the sweetest fucking thing, this series was my favorite thing on YouTube from the start for like two years and I’m glad to see it get a proper ending.
just, why
The dreamsmp brought me through the hard times of covid, and ironically enough it was also one of the best years of my life. I was so hyped to learn that Tommy got into the smp.  I remember staying up until 3am to watch the grand finale stream (I live in like the ph and timezones suck) and being so excited because I'd usually only get to watch the VODs.   I know people say this to every other vidoe you post but, it's just crazy to see that you went from a niche hypixel skyblock streamer, to getting on the earthsmp and gaining some traction and got a decent fanbase and getting in a call with george and eventually getting to join the dreamsmp. I genuinely think you were not just the main character, but also the most important one even off script.  Thank you for making such transfomative content even now.
Now it’s a memory
Bro Tommy, why are you ending?
I will forever be grateful for this time we had, and even though i’m moving on from the fandom the dsmp will forever be my favorite time.  (i started bawling at the techno house, we miss you king)  o7
even though i haven’t been in the dream smp community for like 2 years, it’s what brought me lots of joy and the very beginning of covid. it’s sad to see it ending and honestly i was never updated with the lore, i would just decide to watch a random stream someday, but i still enjoyed it
shit you rly had to do me like that im sobbing so much i might drown it was a rolacoster of funny and on edge moments btw RIP tommys base ily dream smp and Technos home and pets are forever wating for him to retun
Is there any way ever that could be another dream smp video?  😢
Im crying. Мне очень грустно, это конец...
o7
o7
THIS WAS A ROLLER COASTER OF EMOTIONS :,) GOODBYE DSMP o7
"Just killed a Gogy, feeling good!"😂  This video was definitely emotional, as two and a half years a lot of people watched this, and with the loss of Technoblade, it just hits hard. Thank you all so much for bringing joy to us all during such a rough few years❤❤❤
🫡
This came on my recommendation, I remember watching this back in 2020 but didn’t bother with the rest of the series at the latter 2021 up to now.  It’s.. interesting to see how it has progressed so far, and now seeing it end here, it feels like it’s been another memory locked in my past.  Thank you, for the entertainment during lockdown, and thank you for the series in general.

Watching this live was sad as hell..
Bro, i stopped watching dsmp because of the fanbase but this showed up on my recommend and I was full of Nostalgia. Because for the past two years i was watching it out of boredom and I was hooked to this. Even though you made me uh Dirty minded because of the jokes, its ok. Thank you for giving me entertainment.

I'll cry... The dream smp had such a big impact on my life, it inspired me to be who I am, to start my own channel, I loved al these amazing creators who gave me confidence... I Will miss it❤
Y'know.. I wanted to get into the Dream SMP for so long now.. and now it's gone. Hopefully they'll make a new SMP or the QSMP will last forever. But I wanna make a little song before I leave.  The Dream SMP changed our lives But this is where it's about to..  Die.  We made the memories Exploding is the most we've seen, Black and Yellow walls Surrounded me.  Red, White, Blue, Black, and Yellow too We got to see.  The smile on the Mask Came to three It grew up from Manhunts and stuff And now It's all Going up in to flames. Red and White (Tommy) Yellow too (Wilbur) Green, Blue, (Dream, George)  Black and White, (Ranboo and Egg Controlled BBH)  Only us we got to see.  What we have mastered Is finally gone The crater in the server, We got to see. The red vines We got to see.  The messed up George name We got to see.  Prime bell,  TNT,  Blue,  A few animal slaughters,  We got To See.  -o7

as someone who seeked alot of comfort in the dsmp its sad to see it go, the laughs, the tears and the pure confusion these 2-3 years this server has given me i can't say i regret it. The dsmp saved me and bunch others during hard times and i couldn't be more thankful to be apart of this wonderful community. I wish it wouldn't end, i remember l'manburg blowing up for the first time and the second time ofc. I don't regret the hours i spent watching the dsmp and i remember swearing at the election, i remember laughing at tommy and wilbur. i had a great few years.
Thank you for all the laughs, memories, and joy you brought to us from the SMP. We will cherish them forever ❤
IM CRYING RN

I Was there
If only Technoblade Was there…  TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!

This video genuinely made me cry :'D
Well that intro was chaotic
i cried rip dream smp and rip techno these LEGENDS WILL NEVER DIE !!!!!
the visiting to technos cabin made me sob so much. rip 🪦
i am very sad but you can rest now but you have had fun years with the dream smp
this brought back my whole life i spent watching tommy's videos, lots of flashbacks to technoblade's stream and the war which george totally didnt gave a f*ck about. We all thank you for making our life greater than most! This video had me doing the o7 at the end...
All the hard work they have done tho
everything here was awesome
Don’t be sad that it’s ending, be happy that it happened
It started on the bench… and it ended on the bench. Thank you, for everything, all of you guys.
Well that was a fucking awesome series of events :D A rollercoaster if i may say, full of amazing memories and emotion of all kinds :D I... no... We are really thankfull of all the thing this SMP has brought - all the memories, emotions and people in the SMP!  PS: Thank you! This was something really special and awesome <3 o7 POG
This hurts man-
Finally its over
I like duffle ❤
LEEETTTTSSSS GOOOOOOOO, ITTTTT'SSSS OVEEERRRRR
This video brought back memories I thought were forgotten about. Glad to see it revisited 1 last time
I wish techno was able to be there. o7
💿
The End by tommyinnit the adopted child.
Thank you Dream SMP.
this was so wholesome
This was a great trip of emotions, from laughs and giggles to revisiting techno cabin for the last time with somber music brought tears to my eyes to more laughs and giggles, thank Tommy for a great video. This was really special.
Dream SMP actually changed a lot of life's as well as mine I remember watching the new videos while I was in online class... lol it was a nice journey.  -Thank you.
2:45 I can't tell if that "bottom text" was intentional or not lmaooo
...And they lived happily ever after. The End.  Thanks for the memories Tommy. The SMP was really great and engaging. The lore of the world really was something else. You got us through COVID and you and the others definitely were the perfect escape for us. Thank you.
That was the best ender dragon fight I have ever witnessed
I’m actually crying. The Dream smp was such a nice memory for me, It entertained my so much back then. But now it’s coming to an end. Technoblade  never dies, and may we see the last of the Dream smp. o7.
I’m gonna miss this server, This is the only thing that kept me sanity when Covid hit. I hope everyone has an amazing day and love you all! ❤
:(
from hating to dsmp i changed to loving dsmp, it got me kinda emotional on this video somehow lol
it was alright ig
Rip Techno thank you for the laughs Tommy❤️   When Dream blew up 😭
Thankyou ❤  TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
I felt like it was just yesterday since I first watched dsmp, that first stream I watched where wilbur made a hotdog van with tommy. And I continued watching all the way, there is no chance that tommy or anyone will read this but, Thank you, for everything, and to the viewers like me, thanks for sticking by, no matter till the end or stopping. Thank you.
I wasn’t there when L’manburg was first built, and I wasn’t there when the betrayal of Eret happened… basically I missed a lot of the times of the DSMP lore- BUT- I swear to God- WAIT- no, I swear to the Blood God that I cherish this journey with the purest of my heart, both at times you guys role’played and the times that you guys are just messin’ around.  This journey means a lot to me, I mean it.   So in conclusion, all I wanted to say is just that I wasn’t there from the start, but you guys (both the DSMP members and the chats) have made this era the best era there might ever been. Let us refrain this era to be forgotten. So long, chat. ♥️🤞
IM GONNA CRY
I'm so thankful for this server and it's impact on the lives of many of us. It's such a great memory being a fan of everyone in this server and being into the lore. I will never forget how this silly little server and its members made my life better when I was at my lowest. Thank you very much to everyone in the Dream SMP :) I'll miss this shit a ton :) <3
man im gonna miss these types of vids
*Dream SMP never dies*
WHY THE END
Last few months I rly missed techno but I feel like this video got me so sad thinking about all the things techno wasn't able to do with you guys at the end
I can't believe the journey is over, and we are all now having to move on. It's been so great and I will always have nostalgia for the DSMP!
i havent watched a dream smp video in 3 years saw this on my reccomended and it still made me tear up
YYYYYAAAAAAYYYYYYYY NO MORE DREAM SMP
an end of an era i don't think any of us are ready for. o7
All im asking is that u burn the lqbtq flag down before u fully quit
The visit to Techno+Phil's houses had me in pieces honestly...
Finally
farewell
No tommy Don't go

Oh man...i remembered the first time i watched you was when you teamed up with technoblade and dream to defeat sapnap and some other guys (i don't remember it too much) and the first time i downloaded twitch i was looking for your stream first and you were streaming living in technoblade house while you were in exile (i think) and i keep on repeating the same video where lmanburg went to wars....now it all ends here i will miss this very much thanks DSMP and Thanks tommyinnit and finally Thanks Technoblade Rest in peace King
o7
1:10  I feel bad for the chatters that don’t understand tommys sarcasm yet
This video was amazing! I loved watching the dsmp for ages now and although it's sad that it's coming to an end I'm so grateful that I experienced it along with everyone else. Thank you <3
They better not be deleting it bc that had technos memories in
I never knew I would cry for a server in a game i’m not in.
They better not be deleting it bc that had technos memories in
Let's go Tommy
It’s not the same without techno😢😭🥹
This video almost made me cry
Is it just me or was this just really emotional?
Thank you for everything,Dream SMP really changed me.After 3 years of this server It's hard letting go of it.Even through screen I feel so connected with it.Thank you for these awesome years.
This SMP got me through one of the hardest years of my life. I've always held it's videos and people close to my heart despite having no actual connection. They don't know I exist, but they are still some of the best people I've ever known of. I always felt a comfort knowing that this server was out there and that there was this group of people who I could look up to, all gathered on this one server. It's gone now, but I will always have the memories and the laughter I got from this server and it's members.
I think I can say this for most of the dream smp fans that it has changed our life’s and help us with things. In 2020 and 2021 2 of my very close family member sadly passed and I would watch dream smp streams to get my mind off of it. Thank you for all the memory’s. Thank you for all the friends I made. Thank you, dream smp.
It's kinda emotional:(
The dream smp was alot of my MC childhood.But Unfortunately we have to say goodbye.And of course TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIESSSSSSS!
What ra sudeep
o7
My British guy woke up and chose violence 💀  And to end his dream SMP history But we have some good memories while watching :)
WOOOO FINALLY HELL YEAH!!!!! WAR IS OVER WOOO!!!!!!!! THE WORLD IS HEALING!!!!!!!!!!!
"Nothing is permanent all things good or bad must come to an end it maybe sad we all know but journey will be known and as for tommy and tubbo the two of you make a great duo."
Thank you, I'll say goodbye soon Though it's the end of the world
Nothing can ever replace or live up to this server.
I hope you can find a new SMP or something. I know that you are going to make videos (the new things that you can think of (i’ve been subscribed to your for like two years)). I’ll give you a hug when you what it. May I have permission to give you a hug? Cry if you want to. I’m always here.
Les gooooooooooooo
L video no schlatt

o7, thank you for getting me through these years as well Tommy <3
16:42 is emotional when the music kicks in😢

It's so difficult to let go of something that is a biggest part of you on your hardest time, and DSMP was the best thing that happened to me and I'm glad it happened o7

Dsmp saved me, it was with me in the worst moments of my life, for a long time I will not be able to accept its end. It wasn't just a "dumb server" it was much more than that, and the end of it is worse than losing your best friend. Thank you for everything, I will never forget it, this server raised me. Thanks again, good night forever Dsmp, we will all miss you. ❤
Dsmp has been here my whole life and I even got my faimly into it but I'm happy that it was even built and came together ❤❤❤
Спасибо за всë! Вы лучшие ❤

I am genuinely sobbing. Thank you for all the great memories. At the most difficult times this server and all the content gave me a reason to stay alive, i am now actually starting to recover and the dream smp ending at around the same time hits different. Thank you so much for the last 2 1/2 years
When you went to Techno's old base it genuinely brought tears to my eyes. I can tell you had a moment too. RIP Techno (You will be missed forever King) Its been a ride Tommy
It wasnt bad all this ngl but most recent rp vids oh god.. they suck-
Thank god it is over 🙏
o7

Tommy is such a younger brother for calling Dream every 2 seconds to complain 😭❤
teared up when tommy went to techno’s house 😢
After some years : "today I m going to join our 1st smp" I know guys we've been throu 3647 SMPS but this was our favourite, but one thing was best abt it......techno....
HI
End of an ERA man so many feelings connected definitely going to miss this !!
<3
Sad that techno didnt get to see the server end, but lovely what tommy did going to his house one final time for him and every viewer. Can see just how much techno meant to Tommy.❤
o7
Tommy dream smp was a good story
Im crying so hard man. AWHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I remember the first stream I watched about the dsmp, I’ve been in the fandom for 2 years now and I’m so grateful for everything. The dsmp made my life so much happier and even tho I’m sad about it ending, I’m glad that they helped me through everything .
Gg's
Im not crying you are
"dont cry because it's over, be happy because it happened."
Thank You Dream SMP for spending my whole time watching ur streams I'm really happy to see, for the last time good bye Dream SMP and Technoblade see you 😊
Technoblade never dies 🥹🥹🥹😭😭😭
o7
I was never a major Dream SMP fan, by I was close to tears from this. I appreciated its existence, I occasionally watched the streams, but now I wish that I had paid more attention to it. This is what I wish to achieve, something that can inspire others the way that this server has inspired so many across the world, and now me. Being able to create something like this, that is my dream (no pun intended).
I never really watched a lot of the DreamSMP only parts of it, and still this was sad to watch ❤
Rip techno
Pog champ
techno never dies <3
i remember watching techno stream in December 2020 during online schooling. it was when i started watching dsmp content. i discovered tommy, phil and tubbo through techno's streams. thank you to all creators who killed my boredom during lockdown and rest in peace technoblade o7. technoblade never dies.
i cried on the scene when u went to technoblades house
Thanks for everything too man. o7

😭😭😭😭😭
2:45 “Bottom text”
The dream smp was definitely one of the best era of my life, i loved every second of it and I’ll never regret or be ashamed of being part of that community. It made me discover so many cool content creator that I’ll keep watching and that bring me so much joy. Thank you dream smp, thank you for making me so happy, for making me cry too, thank you for being here when i was down Thank you o7
dsmp saved me multiple times in the hardest times in my life. the day im watching this is the day i first found the dsmp, its been a pleasure to be here for 2,5 years. the dsmp has been with me ever since i joined the fandom and when i slowly started to lose interest, and when i found out a bunch of stuff about my self such as my sexuality, my prefrance for romance, and my gender identity. the smp is the reason i have 2 of my closest friends as i met them through the fandom. Its sad to see it go, but ill just keep being happy it happened, as without it my personality would be boring and i wouldn't be as good in english as i am now. im going to keep my dsmp themed room accssesories on my walls till im ready to take them down.  its been a honor, thank you o7 🖤
2:46
)))):
At the end, I started to cry really really hard
Oof
"All good things must come to an end eventually..." o7

Thank you man🥲
You guys changed my life for the best, thank YOU for everything

Thank you tommy for streaming in the DreamSMP all the time im really sad because I did not know that the end was near but I guess nothing really lives forever Thank you tommy.
Thank you to all of the Dream SMP, for all the great memories, especially techno.. You have no clue how much of a positive impact you put on us, especially in lockdown, you practically saved me. love you all ❤❤ :'D
goodbye dream SMP it made me cry when I watched this video
I can't even believe that Technoblade wasn't here☹️
I remember watching dream SMP in 2020 like everyday seeing that it’s over really sad actually but hopefully more can come ❤️
LETS TGOO
look at the text at 2:43
childhood memory
I know I'm not the only one who teared up while he was going through techno's house
OMFG 😭😭😭😭
i wish techno was here
Hi Tommy when will you be releasing new merch??
I never even followed along with the SMP, I’ve only ever watched one episode this year not including this one but I still cried.  Edit, I just finished the video, I cried again.
The dream smp changed my life
😢
Damn....
Should have ended a year ago
You know what is the saddest shit ever? Just as this video ended i got recommended Tommy's first video in the dsmp
It honestly hit me hard how his animals are still in the right place. How his setup armour was in the barrel waiting for his next big plot point. It feels incredibly weird how someone who gave you so much hours of fun time is now dead.  Seeing how he was so young and good makes me want to not waste time and do more about myself. As well as helping others. I hope I will be able to waste less time on meaningless things and concentrate on self improvement. Farewell  TechnoBlade o7.
"Don't be sad because it ended, smile because it happened." - Dr Seuss

Thank you for all the memories. DreamSMP surely changed and affected my life in a great way. Im glad for these 2 years. Thank you for all the people that make it happened

I nearly cried when you went at Techno’s base! Also when you said the phrase: Last video of the dream SMP!😭🥹
o7
So nice to be able to tune in to a TommyInnit stream on the Dream SMP during Covid. I don't know if it helped me, or changed me as a person. But it was just so nice.

Do you guys know if there will be a world download released to the public?
i literally cried when Tommy visited technos base
Don’t even know how many times I cried over the dsmp it’s gonna be the last time I cry over new things.
this just made me miss techno more i cant beliebe its over
The fact that Techno couldn't be a part of this stream is really heartbreaking. 💔 Rest In peace o7 🐷👑❤
Time flows The two years were wonderful For our memories for DreamSMP for techno  for tommy for everything we love. Goodbye❤
This was so emotional for me
Tf has happened to dreams voice
Make sure, later, some random guy on YouTube will download Dream SMP's map and try to start another SMP, and it will become the shittiest-
I don't even watch the smp and im tearing up i just felt the emotion on Tommy's voice I'm soft as sh*t😢😢
DreamSMP season 2?
Technoblade never dies!
This smp ended the second Techno dissapeared, and im glad you have finally realised it. Fly high potato guy :(
I pretty sure everyone started crying at this point, I wasn't here for the start but it was epic
I am gonna miss my childhood
I don't know why but I still think that someday a miracle would happen and we will get a news that techno being the first man to come back to life all of his 16 million fans would just pray so much that even God revives him😢
Technoblade never dies
This is definitely the sadness and greatest video of Tommy's yet... The dream smp changed my life over the years of wathibg these super incredible people playing my most favorite game in the world... They even motivated me to keep on playing no matter what bc of them i also met friends... SO THANK YOU DREAM SMP!
i miss techno i am crying now
Crap I pressed the dislike button by mistake ahhhhhh
Oh. I just cried at a tommyinnit video... Shit.  That was one hell of a ride
I started watching during COVID, and the Dream SMP was one of the things that I followed religiously. I reveled in the story, art, and community. It will always have a special place in my heart and memories. I'm sad to see it go, but I'm glad that I was there to experience it, and I will forever be thankful for everything it gave me. Goodbye Dream SMP. o7
ok.
Dream SMP Sucks
Dramatic disconect button pressing intensifies!
Y-your kidding, right? T-this cant be it! Theres no way it’s done! But like in life… every good thing has to come to an end… thank you Tommy… I just wish it could have gone for longer… goodbye, dream SMP… the lore was the best part about it, even though I was never on it… I watched your videos and, well… it was the best time in my life…
I have been there to watch you since you started now i don't watch you too much but I'm sad to see you go, i hope you have a good life Tommy!
Thank you everything. This server saved me from boredom in covid and more times. I remember i was watching ALMOST all of the streams and just laughing. Im really sad that some people couldnt be there, but even tho, this was a good finale. Thank you for this wonderful time. o7
Well... B Y E
6:25 😭
So good that it ended
AWHHHHHH OMG TOO MANY RANDOM MEMORIES KEEP IT FOREVER WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER
Man. It's insane to think that this has finally come to a close. I still remember the first time I clicked on a tommyinnit video and having my throat feel so hoarse from laughing. I remember finding Wilbur, Techno, Tubbo and everyone else through Tommy and the Dream Smp. Sometimes I wonder how I managed to get through COVID and all the lockdowns without going crazy and then I think back to how I'd join every stream I could, following and turning on as many twitch and YouTube notifications that my phone would handle, reading fan works of all the imaginative ideas of the community, listening on loop to the banger songs and just scrolling through twitter and looking at the geniunly inspiring art and animation. The Dream Smp was a new chapter for me. I changed schools, started college and moved home. Everything in my life changed, even my interests and with that came DSMP. I've been watching since near the beginning and to be honest, I never expected I'd be here. A few months ago, I fell off a little, other intests and schoolwork being my main focus. Still, I kept my eye on it. Now it's over. I don't think I'm sad about it. I'm grateful that I got to discover all these people. Not all the contents for me of course, but Tommy's vlogs and comedy, Techno's hilarious deadpan humour- everything. It helps inspire me to be the best person I can. I'm so happy I got to see this through and I can't wait to see what's next for Tommy and everyone else. Thank you Dream Smp for creating such a beautiful time in my life, in the community's life, and in the people who are actually part of the servers life. You've changed all of us for the better. 🩵
Спасибо я вновь плачу.Так грустно осознавать это
the dream smp will be the best and always the best.I hope that they g back to it in like a decade or to🥲🥲😢😭😭😭

i just hate that Technoblade wasn't there
"Good things must eventually come to an end"

Sad that techno didn’t get to this point😢
Literally everyone: NO I'm not crying, you're crying!
I'll miss it all the memories they had its sad to let it go but, I'm happy for it
No Tommy. Thank YOU for everything. I am so so sad that this era has ended. But I am so thankful for all the memories. We love you Tom <3 Rest in power Technoblade 🐷👑❤️ You will never be forgotten king. o7
Technoooooooo :((((
It’s the end of an era. Thanks for all the good memories<3
Seeing Techno's inventory really hit hard. I haven't been able to watch his content since he passed until today when I rewatched the potato wars, and I feel terrible about crying my way through the content he made to make people laugh, but fuck, I miss him and his humour and how genuine he was.
damn.
Are you going to stop
Noooo
so sad to see the DreamSMP go, but forever grateful for how much it changed my life!! <3 <3 <3
Wait is he quitting?!
dream doesn't sound like dream or is it just me
I don’t know what to say this time so I will just leave this comment as a memory
I cried.
Aaaa
Best time of my life ever I love you content I hope you good luck 😢
Il miss this 😢
This was just a rollercoster of emotions, I cried and laughed and I will never be embarrassed to be apart of this community, it has been so much fun.  Goodbye DreamSMP
Noooooooooooo Dream SMP
Farewell
Noooooooooo
the content of the server in its prime was unmatched, this is probably the last time i watch a tommyinnit video too, thank you for the memories
I will miss the SMP
even if the fanbase got kind of cringy, it was still a fun time during the peak of covid to watch a lotta the videos  technoblade never dies o7
It was one heck of an adventure. It may have ended, but the memories will live on. Thank you for accompanying me through the harsh moments of life. o7  Last but never the least, Technoblade Never Dies 🐷
It really make me cry 😢😢😢😢
I wish that Dream SMP could've last forever, but as we know all good things must come to an end eventually. I will forever appreciate all the memories that i've got to have while watching your streams :)
I don't believe it's over
Rip Techno
Good bye dream smp live long 🕊️🕊️
The dsmp changed my life.  It’s sad to see it go… But thanks that it’s happened.
Dream SMP was literally my go to for every streams for everyone apart of it, helped me a lot through COVID and my high school days since 2021 even through my personal struggles, so just thanks for you, Tommy and everyone for bringing me memories to always look back on. And GOSH hit me hard with Techno literally cried my eyes out.
Thank you Tommy.
Who ever reading this God bless you saying to who believe
о7
i had some man tears roll of my face....  technoblade never dies
e
I am glad i was born at the right time to experience dsmp. If i was born few years earlier or later my life would have never been the same.
It honestly feels like that school graduation. The end of a chapter of a book to see the next one. We'll see the same Tommy chaos again but we will miss the DreamSMP chaos
I will miss this smp it had so many memories
im not crying u are.  nvm im crying too,  thank you all for everything, i will cherish the memories forever
😢😢
Thank god it’s over
O7 DSMP.
wow i havent watched the dsmp in like a year but ive been there from the start. im bawling like hell rn wow
o7 ty for everything
Thank you so much for bringing it to a close . It was something else during covid we all grew up alongside the server . Thank you for everything
Thank you to everyone in the dreamsmp, you guys really changed my life and how i look at things. this video brings back so many memories and i really hope that we can keep them going and that we’ll never forget them 💕
Was there a specific reason to why the smp shut down after all this time?
I don't like the shouty British kid
Just o7 for everyone
Sad to see it's all over.
Dream SMP was such a phenomenal part of my life and I am so happy that I was here for the streams and the videos and the lore. I will never regret the late night stream watching and the hours I spent theorizing lore and interacting with other fans online. Thanks for the memories!!
i didn't even watch the server that much, how am i getting nostalgic and sad :( :D
i’ve never really watched the entirety of the lore. but the fun streams on the dsmp where they just did goofy stuff and memes will always be dear to my heart:,)
And we all know that the pets on that server will roam and guard it till the end of time. The memories will remian. The stories will be told. The tales will be passed down to our children as bedtime stories. We will remember. We will remember this beautiful server where people made a story. A story worthy of so many things but will never get it, just because it was made in a game. But that’s what makes it special. It’s a one-time opportunity. I know that in our memories, all of ours, we will remember. We will remember the Great Tommyinnit, Technoblade the Wise Warrior, Dream the Mastermind, and so many more. All the people, all the chats, all the events. I may not have been here since the very beginning, but I know that I still know the full story. We all do. This journey was fun. We can all agree on that. Goodbye DreamSMP. You will be remembered.   o7
The last Video :(
Try to play Valorant it is cool
dream's voice sounds different 😭😭😭
Thank you, this fandom changed me im happy i was able to be in this wonderfull fandom..
This video has a lot of nostalgia in it I cried almost throughout the entire video this video is very heart touching ❤❤❤❤❤❤
+bye tommy
I watched every single one of the amp episodes I watch every one of them and now it is the end I cried I am so sad
Rip techno blade
I WAS THERE!!!
My one wish was to join this server as Dicee_, so sad to see it go, but meh, I have other things to do anyway.
7000 comment!
YEESSSSS
Bro i thought the dream SMP ended when THE GOD TENCNOBLADE and dream nuked the dream SMP
o7 boys, pleasure to meet you
I never would have thought id cry over a vidio game, fuck man
DREAM SMP ❤❤❤
Even I, who has not watched any dream smp video, or stream (maybe except for 'A tribute to dream SMP') It is sad seeing it go.
Why it is dream smp last video?
i was never a fan of the dream smp until techno but now its gone everyone made a big impact and its sad to see it go so all i have to say is technoblade never dies and the dream smp will never die either
I'm sad now dsmp has changed my life and I'm so grateful for everything 😢😊❤ I watched this live and I was in Spain and after I was in Spain without the s 😭
o7 boys it's been a pleasure to meet you
Goodbye Dream SMP, this is the server that made my childhood and it was great whilst it lasted. o7 Dream SMP
I thought season 2 was coming
rip
I've never regretted a second of joining this community. Watching it grow as a family was so heartwarming. I don't think we'll ever get the same experience from anything else. This was my therapy. This was my center of joy. This is where instead of crying tears of sadness, I cried tears of joy. Thank you, Dream SMP, for this one last stream. It has truly been an honor being part of this.  Edit:"Should the day ever come that we are not together, you will continue to shine like gold in my memories."
Goodbye Dream SMP from Tommyinnit playing it for the last time ever, we will miss all the chaos and roleplay on it.
Bro the first part*RUUUN,AAHHHHHHHHH*😂😂😂
:(
Heres to a new Adventure
17:22 gayy
The highlight of Covid. TECHNOBALDE NEVER DIES...
O7
Man, visiting Techno's Cabin one last time really hit me hard. All the artwork on the walls, his animals... just realizing he'll never see them again really hurts.   DreamSMP really was one of the best things to come from Covid. All the animations, art, and of course the actual streams were so fun to be a part of. And I'm so glad I was there from the start. I also absolutely agree with Tubbo's favorite moments; the First L'manburg War and the Pogtopia arc were definitely my favorites. Eret's Betrayal, the Elections, the Festival; I remember watching the streams for all of them, and they were so good.   Thanks for the memories, DreamSMP; I'll always remember you fondly,
This stream was special, it brought a chapter in everyone’s lives to a close. Thanks for all the memories Tommy and everyone involved.  o7 Technoblade never dies 👑
😢the end of an era o7 thanks to everyone on this server for all the memories and rip techno ❤
Finally it's over get inn
goodbye 👋

Being in the DSMP community has change my life, and seeing it go just make my heart break but even thought I will always remember the memories and the happiness the dsmp gave me❤❤
As someone who was just here for story and didn’t really watch and wasn’t really a fan, still sad to see this go.
I will miss the dream smp and I will miss dream trying to kill you and I always wanted to join the dream smp I’m a huge fan of dream and the dream smp members
god finally granted my wishes
This must bring back memories 😢
KING TOMMY !

I can't belive tommy will quit youtube now, such a shame

Would been so funny if in the cut scene with the last disc listen dream ran by and stole the disc, just for fun
Comment before watching the video- I am very scared because of it ending but I hope its a new opening to something new  Comment after watching the video- I cried. The dsmp is the reason I am alive and I'm really sad it's ending. I'm happy for all the memories  <3 Thank you, dsmp <3
ty for everything Dream SMP <3 o7
Thank you for this. This really touched my feelings..
damn..
Wilbur and his storywriting skills was mainly the reason dream smp was as good as it was at its peak. The chaotic energy of Tommy, Tubbo, Quackity, combined with scriptwriting skills of Wil, and the charisma of Techno, Phil. We are grateful for providing us with the absolutely hilarious content from the Dream SMP. Thanks to each and every member.  -old Subscriber

i never thought that this server will ever come to an end. It will always be a part of my childhood. Watching Tommy Tubbo Dream Techo. This actually made me cry
plot twist: this was a late April fools video
In Germany we call it "Gänsehaut" This was one of those videos where you just get emotional, this server and this people saved so many people, including me. Crying was planned here, but not that much. This led me through 2 years of my life. Thank you. Thank you Tommy, thank you DSMP
Technoblade never dies

Is it me or dream sounds so different
Can't believe this started 2 years ago when Tommy started to gain a lot of attention, such an emotional rollercoaster. But rest in peace to Techno 😥😥
Totally not crying about this  I can’t believe it’s over
How two little house on the middle of snow can be so emotional
U stole technos stuff man
I am so grateful that i am in this community.  Dont cry because its over. Smile because it happened.  Thank u , the Dream SMP.
😢😢😢
This ended as it started
Techno❤
Leaving a comment for posterity. Thanks to everyone on the DSMP. It's an amazing thing to do something so amazing with your friends, and have that be shared with millions of others in a time where every little positive silly thing and distraction was worth its weight in gold. Thanks for all the fun times o7
After 2 years they fought the ender dragon again with iron armor 💀
This server has been so much to me, and so much to so many others I'm sure. It's been an absolute rollercoaster, right from the start, and all I want to say is thanks for being there, thanks for helping me to laugh through it. Sure, my sense of humour will never be the same, but you know what? It's only for the better. So, even though this is the end of an era that has lifted me up, and helped me through so much, I can't thank you and everyone else on this server enough. Too bad my parents will never understand. Goodbye Dream SMP, you will always hold a special place in my heart. (Maybe where men can go and emancipate the brutality and the tyranny of their rulers.) o7
An End of an era.       "It may not come back, or it might return With Old and new faces.. but we all should remember. This put smiles, frowns, downs, or turned it all upside down when we watched them.  Goodbye Dream SMP.. We must say goodbye to a legend."
thank fuck
This was probably the best 2 years of my life. Thank you Dream SMP for everything.
The dream SMP will be always in my heart ❤
Cool
Who broke in tears while watchin this vid 😢
o7
Watching the SMP without Techno is bittersweet. His Rivalry with Dream will go down in History! May you rest easy Techno, and I hope you`re watching this with a smile in heaven.
what an emotional roller coaster. well done tommy..
May our paths be crossed again.. if Dream SMP S2 ever releases
This was the best smp to ever exist 🎉
See you in the end
Thank You
Now this truly makes me sad, i love the dream smp series that U make. Thank you for these wonderfull years.
It is really sad how the dream SMP ended. I really loved this series; I watched every stream and video of it! I just hope another server like this happens between these awesome creators. We will miss the Dream SMP
I am so glad that everyone in the dream smp met together again its actually really sad to see that this will be the last you all will be together again...
I feel bad for the ones who didn’t get to see the end, like techno
Thank you for everything
the dream smp has had such a big impact on my life and i cant thank it enough. the end of an era ill never forget and be very thankful for. o7 dsmp.
I think it had a good run. Goodbye, dream SMP. it helped me make a few friends and definitely impacted me in a way.   Rest in power, technoblade. o7
my pc started lagging from all this tnt
And that is the last we see of The Unfinished Symphony, the reason all those wars started, the beginning and the end. L'Manburg
Whhhhhaaaaaa
It’s a shame that Wilbur and Phil weren’t there
LETA GOOO
is he going to stop  youtube or is he going to stop dream smp
Your finishing YouTube
visiting technos house has got me choked up
I miss it..
o7
Thank you for everything, Dream SMP.  You will never be forgotten.❤
Thanks Tommy and tubbo for last five 3 years of entertainment , don’t know how Covid era would’ve passed without you guys
sad wilbur wasnt there
I remember the first time I watched a dream smp video I was extremely sick and found a l'manburg animatic and after that I started watching a lot of streams. but tommys was the one seen first. its been a pretty cool experience :) kind of sad to see it go for good
Dream SMP was a big impact on everyone’s lives, I think we can all agree. Here’s to Season 2!🍻🍻
good
Why are u leaving dream smp it made me cry 😭😭😭
I am going to cry now bye.
GG
I was there for  all their final stream of DSMP. This stream was a very emotional day for them and for fans like me. I haven't watched their streams for so long that it was 6 months ago (August 2022) due to college and the lack of their DSMP streams. I love them so much that they made me feel better when I was sad, unmotivated, and alone, and I seek comfort for them every day in COVID quarantine days, even though a lot of hate, bash, and everything else was received around the DSMP and the community. As a fan, it has a big part in my life in 2020-2023, and this has a special place in my heart, which is why it means so much to me. Thank you so much, DSMP and members, for the golden memories especially to Tommy. I will cherish it for my whole life <3 I love you everyone and in the community, especially the fans. Take care of yourself, guys, wherever you are <3
I almost cryed lol
Is season 2 not coming
o7
This somehow makes me feel old which just shows how young I am… Covid was a hard time in our lives and this helped so much to get through it, and now that its gone i feel an odd sence of sadness that its over but I will always cherish the memories of the D Smp, waiking up every morning and checking for new content more live streams it was a beautiful time. Rest in peace D Smp.❤️
What does this mean for Tommy now? Thank you all for the last two and a half years, you saved my life and I’ll forever be grateful for that.  Fly high.
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!!
o7
Was a good journey A bitter sweet ending R.I.P Techno you will always be remembered
I told my self not to  cry but then I let it all out
haloooo
I almost cried in 11:00 to 12:20 😢😢😢 We love Technoblade ❤❤❤ Legend never dies , Thanks to Tommyinnit to let's us watch again his base. Techno was a true legend
I never watched these videos, but looking at this last one, seeing techno’s cabin again, blowing up the hotel. Really does make me want to go back and see all the other videos.
wow
o7
17:51 No thank you for bringing us all through covid, entertaining us , creating hype videos, and just for putting time and effort in
visiting techno’s place for the last time 😕
Its bittersweet...
NOOOOOO 😭
whos cutting onions?
the best memory of all this was... Technoblade.
Made me tear up...
techno can't even be alive at this point R.I.P THE KING!
Finally the Dream smp is gone lmao
Bro I was watching you from the start I am not crying you are
I will never forget this server <3
Damn., For Two years of watching these videos It's Kinda it You know.. It's the end of Happiness Dream smp changed my life. now you don't need to thank us Tommy we need to thank you. And all of you guys "thank you".
Im not sad cause its over im happy cause it happend
what da fak happen to dream's voice  edit: best video ive ever watched from Tommyinnit, especially when he visited Technoblades house. Very childish of me commenting ts...
I think we can all agree now, tommy is no longer a child, but a teenager.
I remember watching this every time a new stream came or a video on the dream smp I'd be so hyped. Better than any movie I have ever watched. Thank you for making this masterpiece. Just wish techno coud have been a part of it in its last moments. Rest In Peace technoblade. You will never be forgotten. Technoblade never dies.
I was just looking though all the comments slightly depressing but here 🧀 a yummy piece of cheese 💜
Dream Smp was amazing. It always made me happy to see a stream or video being posted. I cried when Tommy walked through Techno's house. Rip Techno o7 I'll miss the dream smp
9:00 13:34
So is there gonna be a season two?
It was definitively meant to be. o7
Don't be sad that it's over, be glad it happened.
love you techno 💗
thank you for all these moments, I love you all who come from the DSMP. Thanks for all ❤
Glad the creators can move on tbh, cause damn, I don't hate all the people on it, I just hate the stereotypical toxic culture surrounding the server as a whole. It is nice seeing a lot of people who have had very, ya know, normal attachments to this server and the people on it, and for them I'm sad it's gone. Purely selfishly, thankfully it's over
Tally hoe Tommy
I refuse to believe it!😭😭DREAM SMP was the best and always be! no other SMP can replace it:)Its very important to you as well as us i remember during the covid time i used sit in front of my pc and just watch your streams those amazing days!!❤It was amazing to get to know about this amazing SMP loved all those streams of yours and other its very hard to say but GOODBYE DREAM SMP<3😭😭❤❤
Nooooo😢 don’t leave the dream smp
Goodbye , Dream Smp :'D
O7
Damn that hurts. I’ve watched the dream smp for a long time now I was there almost at the beginning and seeing this server come to an end is heartbreaking but also kinda ok or something idk:)
My eyes were full of tears from 10:58
bro that hit harder than a truck. that smack of seeing technos cabin the old war sites and even the bunker. i would just come back just to see the sights and think of the memorys that where left behind. Its not just a game, its much much more. good luck to you all and may you find peace in this ruthless world
Please don't repeat the path of Techno
I was so happy I was there on the last stream! I think it was good that it ended like this and not without a stream
Nostalgia😢
I never watched any of the streams. But I followed you all in every step, The moment you joined. Right down to here, The moment you left. I'm able to prove that even if you haven't followed the moment it happened, even if you weren't there. With everyone, It feels if you're Able to feel their emotions, Even if you weren't there. Able to follow their steps, Every single stream.  I have too much to talk about.  So I'll mention my favorite or more fond too characters.  My favorite person ever was technoblade. He knew true humor, And had a great heart. He followed what he wanted in life, Became a legend that will never die. And never loss. Only went down, In a tie.  Jshlatt. An expertise in comedy, With jokes I've never seen before. A mic of loudness, And a pause of each joke. Adding atmosphere to every word he said, I respect that.  Tubbo. A man with the bees. Truly a friend to stick with in thick and thin. Always there, ALWAYS... He's high spirited and added so much to my heart. I respect that.  Dream. I thought to disrespect him at first. That was until I found out this was all scripted, I respected him even then and love how much of a villain he played in the story. He truly gave off the vibe of a PVP master, And genius in tough situations. I respect that.  George. Like ranboo I never followed his character, The funniest moment I saw when ninja tried to marry him. I respect his character and respect his intention. And all the funny fanfictions of dreamnotfound, I respect that.  Badboyhalo. Gave a sense of family friendliness, It never worked out in the end. Calling everyone a muffinhead and sticking with skeppy. I respect that.   And last but definitely not least  Tommyinnit. The star, The big man, The british baby boy. He was my first calling to watch this smp. He was always there. He made so much happen in this SMP story, He was a star. He was the protagonist.  Tommyinnit was always childish, Atleast from the start. Building his career with youtubers he only DREAMed to meet. It was inspiring, Heart warming, And amazing. I feel as if I were there. Walking each step on the prime path. To victory, To Glory,                                                              To End.  I sincerely Respect that.
DreamSMP Changed my life man, such a great experience. Tommy, Quackity, Schlatt, George, I'll never forget any of em
Dream SMP for life!!! ❤
Music disk never dies!
House of memories
Tommy has anyone informed you dream was into minors

When he went to technos house I felt a bit emotional ngl WHAT AN emotional video.. good bye dream smp! Your were a good server that kept me going through covid
I was putting off watching any of the last dsmp videos/streams but Tommy thankfully made light of it so it wasn’t as sad
welp, it has been long i thought it wouldnt end yet sadly it did, rest in peace, dream smp
Dream SMP was one of the few things that got me through C*vid and growing up and everything else life threw my way, like everything else I'm sad to see it go and will probably catch myself rewatching clips from years ago (lol) to ease it. I'm happy we got this big goodbye and that I - and I'm assuming others - got the closure we needed. Goodbye Dream SMP, you will be forever in our hearts and minds. o7 o7 o7 ❤️❤️💔❤️
techno. never. dies.
why is the last video of the dream smp
What a memory. This SMP will remain a part of my life forever.
SOMEONE MAKE THE EDITS! GO GO GO!
Rest in pizza😢
about time this happened! i’ve always despised the dream smp and i will continue to do so. i am very happy that the dream smp is finally over.
every story has an end... and where one ends... a new one waits right around the corner...
I wanna cry.
thank you ❤
This man is literally milking the end of the smp to death
I honestly think the Dream SMP died along with Technoblade, but the memories I had and the person I became because of this server will never go away.  Thank you.
RIP dream smp For tommy

Thank you for the Dream SMP series we will never forget
😢
… the house … tommy. why rest in peace Technoblade
Dream SMP is what reborn me. All these wars, fights and sometimes peaceful moments gave such an indescribable explosion in me! I love each of you! FOREVER WITH YOU! WE LOVE YOU! ❤❤❤❤
It hits me hard that Techno is gone but his home and his pets are gonna sit there, waiting for him for eternity.
The end of an era.
I am crying after watching this video for the third time :')
this is the end of an era
Dream SMP was one of the best times of COVID. In all the sad and depressing atmosphere, these guys came on and stream the whole thing on twitch and YouTube making us laugh and cry. They shared every moment with us. We were a part of dream SMP and will always remember it
Why you should leave, why doesn’t everyone continue:(
Ever since me and my cousin saw the Dream SMP we fell in love it really made the quarantine bearable and it changed my life and seeing it end makes me happy with the mixed feeling of sadness thanks to you all ❤❤
The technoblade part made me cry.
Thank You Dream SMP!
plot twist: They make a new world called ''Dsmp season 2''
I’ve only watched a few of em. It was awesome. The dream SMP is over, but I wonder what else they’ll have in store for the future.
I’m not crying you are
Tommers
I actually cried when you went into technos house. The most sentimental vid on this channel. Will always love Technoblade.

The war is ended and dream is soo happy to play together with he's friends ❤
I dedicated so much of my life into watching and loving this sever, I was in 8th grade. Now I’m nearly a Junior in high school. Today I was going to take down my L’mandberg flag but I knew I just couldn’t. Nothing could ever replace the joy and excitement I felt when I first got it. This sever changed, helped and inspired me and so many others. Good bye Dream SMP. Thank you, so much for the memories. o7 ❤️🟩
So long sweet prince
Tommy Entering Techno's House: What do you mean, I'm not crying ( Starts Screaming in sadness )
DreamSMP truly changed many-many lives and that's fucking amazing. о7
I might aswell MLG with my own bucket of tears.
i'm so proud yet so devastated all in one, my life is flashing before my eyes and all i want to do is rewind time and savor those moments, as i sat there laughing and begging techno would win the championship. thank you to everyone who played a role in the Dream SMP. it's been an honor to be apart of history. GG boys, TechnoBlade Never Dies.
This hurts my heart, I will forever and ever appreciate these people they had such an impact on me  And always managed to make my days better  I balled out crying like 4 times in this video  Thank you for everything Tommy<3
💙✨️
Finally
good
I wish the ending was with all the members but rip techno rip dream smp ❤❤
Imagen if sad-ist were to do one last smp animation based on this
This ended so fast, there is so much left unfinished and if I have to be honest I'm in denail. This server made me who I am, I will never forget it and it will always be my favorite thing. I have so much more to say but just like the DreamSMP I will leave it unfinished </3 o7
Dream smp made my childhood, it’s so sad to see it go but it was amazing.❤
Tommy can you make a playlist of all the videos on the dream smp in order from the first video to the this video. This was such a fun time. I’m sad it’s over but can’t wait for what’s next. Please and thank you.
Nothing lasts forever
Ok you made me cry 😢
And in like a year they're gonna return for nostalgia.
Who watched the stream? 👇
i havent see tommy playing in dream smp like 1 year and now it happened its the end.
This server really pulled me out of a deep depression and I will always remember that.
I cried, YOU MADE ME CRY AGAIN, YOU LITTLE SHIT. it's been a blast... But it's time to say goodbye, to My L'manburg, to some discs, to all those wonderful times we laughed and cried and were hyped af.  And to a Blade that never dies. O7
Wy wy wy
thank u for everything
Noooooöoooooooooooo
wow 2 years im irl crying right now ❤
"no matter how ridiculous the odds may seem, within us resides the power to overcome these challenges and achieve something beautiful. That one day, we’ll look back at where we started and be amazed by how far we’ve come.” — Technoblade
Goodbye old smp :)
*GOOD ENDING*
forgot to comment when this uploaded but this was a beautiful and emotional video. I remember the summer mornings I spent watching dream SMP. Seeing this really brings back some good memories and its saddening to see it all end
Not kidding i almost cried
Tommy does the world download become public at some point?
Shut up I'm not crying you're crying
it so sad bro that its over
Even though that Techno could not see this with us and that DSMP might not last forever there's always an end for everything we love But mostly  Techno Blade Never Dies.
idk what to say
I am not crying, you are.
great times :)

Tommy was a good creator He never left us or our hearts he was a strong funny man Lmanburg pogtopia were good The real Achivment was the freinds we made along the way...

"Don't cry because it ended, be happy because it happend"
i will and ALWAYS will renember this server forever R.I.P techno and R.I.P dreamSMP.
o7 Dream SMP.
Tommy  You should know that when the server is shutdown and use a world file to join You can't have the inventory back In other words, you lose the techno disk
I'll also be forever grateful for finding out about you guys and watching your videos and vods, they cheered me up and it really made me feel happy watching the DSMP! The end is a new start even if we just leave it at 'The End'.   We know it will never be, because it wasn't meant to be :) DSMP has touched and saved many lives, it may just be a video game and people roleplaying but it was also the community each streamer created that made us feel like home and together as one. o7 to our King Techno, as he also inspired many just as everyone else did ❤ Thank You Tommy!
I wish that you did the outro music at the end
I will miss the dsmp so much man.
it aint even that deep💀💀💀
Tommy❤
Seriously, it all ends? Just like this? It's so sad. 😢
Damn. Next video now
I have never cried watching any of Tommy's videos but this was an emotional rollercoaster and at the end I finally cried but I'm so happy I got to watch my favorite youtubers play, do wars and at the end we can say it's a Good Ending ❤❤
Is it Only me or is it more then me that get emotional?
I love you ❤ wall u mare me ❤
I had goosebumps after the ender dragon battle
Thank you dream smp it’s been a great 2 years full of memories laughs and smiles, y’all made lockdown so much better thank you for the great times and memories :,)

The smile that changed the world. 16:16
Oh fuck I'm crying
Frick man.
TOMMY what about you start an life steal smp with all the members  of the dream smp where YOU HAVE THE POWER
Pls post more on servers
I still can’t believe it’s been two and a half years since I first see a dsmp video. I didn’t even know they were role playing at that time. Even though I’ve stopped watching dsmp video for a long time,I’m still grateful about how much pleasure it has brought to me during the tough times. I’ll like you,Tommyinnit,forever,as well as Tobbo,Dream,Techno,and everyone else.
All the memories Tommy has been through is insane
Big W
genuinely felt like crying when you went back to techno’s place 🥲🥲
This is actually kinda funny
So memorable I almost cried
cryinnit
Goodbye, Dream SMP
Im literally crying  I’m gonna miss you tommy😢
One word: wholesome
will there be a world download?
What's the ip so I can see the server myself
The Dream SMP kept me sane and alive during those rough days in the height of covid. I remember doing online school and having the streams on my phone and watching them while doing my homework. I remember being so invested that I would set alarms for the streams and get so happy to watch them! The Dream SMP will always be a fond memory and era I will always remember and cherish. Thank you so much for helping to create this community man. Truly you and every other member are amazing. You all have come so far, and I think I speak for all of us here to say that we are proud of you and the others.
If techno were here it would have been better but ....... 🕊
BYE DSMP ILL MISS YOU
0:01 these timed comments are way to cool
F4 YOU TOMMY YOU MADE ME CRY AND I'M NOT DED OF A F4 KING CRYER YOU B4

Hooolayy dude. This was such a powerful vid. Even tho I found dream smp only last year, I feel like I have been with everyone on this journey since the beggining, since u died I a hole lol. Truly, this can never be replicated and never redone, this is the best conclusion ever and I am soopo happy u made it. Thanks tommy, to you and everyone else (but mainly u) 🙂
Thanks for all !! Thanks for just existing<3
Technoblade never dies
i wanted u to cry
Gal2 psta

I'm having a total heart attack, I don't want it to end :'<
0:00 nah time stamps ARE WAY TO COOL
Goodbye too and thanks for everything cuz y'all made me smile when I am upset I never knew dream smp will end .......
you can tell tubbo and tommy will be pals for life
I miss techno when you visit his house I wish techno was alive to kill the ender dragon
Wow, the Dream SMP was really special, it inspired loads of people and kept their hopes up during quarantine, I'm sorry for those who have lost a member of their life during this time and I believe this server, the videos, the streams and the tiktok edits that can with it will be remembered in our old years. Good day to everyone and Technoblade never dies.
this server is the only thing that has kept me going for so long, this community is amazing. im sad to see it go, but im happy it happened. its the end of an era. Im sad to see some of the last pieces of techno go, but he lives on outside of the server, and in our memories. This community has kept me going, i always say when things get hard, or tough, watching these videos really help. i always think about the chance i might meet someone from the DSMP, even though i live in alaska and it will never happen. thank you, tommy, and everyone else for everything you do, and what you have done for me and so many others. Techno never dies, and neither will the dreamsmp.
I remember watching the streams when the pandemic started. It was one of the highlights during those bad times and I remember talking about it with my friends. I did eventually stop watching dreamsmp when people got too heavily invested. it definitely was one of the best series to watch on the internet. This video being unscripted and natural kind of reminded me of the chaotic yet peaceful moments that happened everyday during the pandemic. Thanks tommy for all the great moments and memories.
I was 12 when the dream smp started, so you could say this server made my childhood.
Man when you go to techno's house i was heart broken I've been tearing up
;_(
everytime i remenber techno i cry
THANK YOU DREAM SMP
fucking painful, man
Techno...
wow , it ends
oh tommy
Farewell Dream Smp. You will always been in our hearts and souls. Techno Never Dies. I hope you guys will be ok. I wish everyone from the Dream Smp. A good day and take care of yourselfs. May God be with you all.
The dsmp changed my life and Tommy was the first person I started watching and now I'm just crying I mean who didn't cry when u went to THE cabin and sat on THE bench pls don't like delete this channel cause im not trusting you after this. Good luck on future endeavours<3 <3
Technoblade never dies o7

this made me cry so hard
Dream SMP was one of the best things in my life, although I am so sad that I couldn't keep up with it in 2022,I still loved it, so weird that it's finally over, what a great journey it was
Oh this hurts me, DSMP was with me during the hardest parts of my depression. It quite literally kept me alive and it’s sad to see it go. Thank you Tommy, you were always my favorite to watch.
Sad pp
Technoblade never dies
I’ve tried to watch this ten times and every time I just can’t do it. The dsmp literally is like 99% of my personality. Love you all❤️❤️❤️
Remember when Technoblade said he would be the cool mentor who died halfway through the series. Mans insane, called every shot to the very end rip
I guess all good things have to come to an end sometime…
This is history bruh
I’m crying in tears😭  I’m not lying 😖  I’m like your biggest fan😭  I’m bout to watch all your videos again I’m so sad😭😭😭😭😣😭😭😭😭😭😭☹️
Seeing techno's house and knowing that he'll never be back in it was really saddening.
Goodbye Dream SMP. U changed my life and kept me alive during the darkest times. Specially in Covid. Its an amazing journey I will always keep with me. The laughter, the lore, the cries and the swearing. It was all poggers.  Thank you Ending it here 12 May 2021-22 April 2023
I'm not crying you are
nooooooo
I’m so sad the Dream SMP ended, it changed my life. Through mental illnesses and family issues, and during the best times, watching the Dream SMP changed my life. But I’m so happy I have these beautiful memories. The Dream SMP made me truly happy. Thank you Tommy for being such an amazing person, you were and will always be my comfort person. <3
get absolutely mrbeasted
Long live the blade! Technoblade never dies!
ive watch your stream that day
Dream SMP was a wonderful thing in my life. It was always a place to go for comfort. I’d always watch yours and Techno’s streams if they were shown on YouTube. I do hope that you’ve had fun with this. Thank you Dream for making this server and seeing it to what it’s become. Thank you everyone who participated for all the laughs and hard work you put into the server.❤❤
Goodbye.
Hate to see em leave, love to see them go
I can't believe this is the last one. It's been a good run. Godspeed Tom.
o7
Finally
Goodbye dream smp, you have helped me overcome the worst of times and I'm sad to see you go😢😢😢 I loved this smp with Al that happened❤ excited to see what's next
TommyInnit never fails to entertain
I just left the dsmp fandom like yesterday but I’m so sad that I left the fandom:[
Damn…. I didn’t expect this to make me tear up….
why is the server shutting down
aw.. that's it. the dream smp was incredible. all the memories we made along the way. but alas it's time to move on. o7 thank you tommy and everyone else on the dream smp for giving hundreds of hours of entertainment over a time period where i was hella bored and just hated quarantine. i would just wait for the notifications on twitch to watch the stream, or on youtube for techno. i can't believe it's all over. two years. time goes by so frickin fast. im so excited for what the future holds.  wishing everyone a wonderful journey  :) good bye </3
are u my favorite Youtuber!!!! gg Dream SMP well miss u 😔😥
Why is this the last you are streaming here
I miss DSMP
"it was fun...y'know...all good things must come to an end eventually..."  -tubbo
Good, its over.
That last scene really said "I took a picture of myself everyday"
I only joined the fandom last year but it has made such a lasting impact on my life and I will never forget that. Thank you so much for all you have done <3
never thought it would end now and like this after so long. RIP TechnoBlade and DreamSMP
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Have
oh my god i hate that i cried to this
I miss the old set up they used for streaming, making videos.
only if techno was there to see this, rip
The moments shared in this video brought so many tears to my eyes as something great ended.  This saved me so much and took me out of some dark places in my life. I first started watching Tommy around 2 maybe more years ago around the election time if that makes more sense, he always made my day so much better with all of the jokes and even serious things. Just thank you Dream smp for being such a big part of my life<3
Tears flow when he visit techno house😢
Tommyinnit how should someone start their YouTube channel
thank god the dream smp is over (apart from technos cabin that was the only good part, o7 techno)
THAT WAS FUCKING SAD WHAT THE FUCK

Goodbye DSMP we all loved you thanks Tommy for the memories
I was crying so much throughout that stream
Thank you guys, for making DSMP. It has been a crazy journey and it has changed my life!
It was a fun time while it lasted but alas all good things must come to an end and this is the official end of the dream smp (i think its for the better because without techno there its just empty he was such a key member of it all)
So long for the 2 Year ride DREAM SM!P!!!! ty
Good by technoblade good bye
I like how at the end of this episod which Is the final One there Is the First One.

sayonara dream smp..
I can’t believe the dream smp is gone, the smp lore has always been something I would watch when I was low. Even if I was watching from a screen I could feel the emotion the connection with the other players. May the memories of this smp rest well in our hearts.
"i never met dave"
The dream smp was something that changed my life for ever, thank you guys for all the great memories. o7
Rip dream smp
Im not crying my dog is 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I fr began crying man. I grew up with them and I can’t believe it’s all ending
the story of the dream smp will never be forgotten its story and lore is so iconic in the world of gaming tbh i really think someone should turn the whole dream smp story into an animation sorta like a netflix show it would be a hit R.I.P techno its been a fun journey watching this

The first Thing i read was Ban dream
"Don't be sad its over, be happy it happened"-unnus and annus
I’m crying…
you ended it ....i wanted to join you and dream in the dream smp😭😭
Everybody on the SMP built such an amazing community spreading kindness through and through the Internet, and I'm so glad that we will still have these communities, Every ending is a new beginning, and I'm so glad I was a DSMP fan,  I can't wait to see more projects coming from the SMP members, thank you for this finale and the beautiful journey you shared with us throughout the DREAM SMP! Fly high Technoblade, I really hope your legacy will be cherished through the end of timeline.  I'm gonna cry mate.
Can you do a My funniest Dream smp moment?
the aliens are wondering "what the fuck is happening here???" while watching all of tommy's vids.
After I finished the video, the first video that popped up after was “I joined Dream’s server, now he hates me” it is insane to think that crap this whole thing is over, it’s almost like it never existed. I hope dsmp live as long as anyone remembers it and just because no one will stream there anymore, videos of it still exist.
Dream smp has meant so much so many people. It has saved so many. It's sad that it ended but everything has to come to an end. o7
if y'all don't do season 2 the dog gets it
:)
<3
Thank you so much for everything.
EVERYTHING HAS ITS SAD AND BITTER END  infact i am also gonna miss tommys pog champ gameplay
It WAS meant to be
"My keyboard broke up with me" QUOTE BOOK QUOTE BOOK QUOTE BOOK
Good bye dream smp o7
man. Ouch.
We got to tell me to cry we love you Techno goodbye dream SMP
The realisation that it's goodbye forever...
When you went to technos house and looked at the disc, i burst into tears. ive been watching every single lore video and i am so sad to see you leave.
Imagine tommy joined in quackity SMP.  Philza:oh shit..😅

So much fun!
I can’t Believe it ):
Last Time To See Dream SMP 😭😭😭  You All Legend Dream SMP Players
Ok the uhm bell got me emotional
😢😥
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
Tommy stealing from Techno hurt my soul
I mean I’m glad to see you do so great and move on to better things. But I can’t help but think of the void for this kind of content now and how a lot of people really want it. Wish there was more but would never try and make you feel obligated. Best of luck.

You should do series of the smp you did with Eret, Ranboo and shubble. I think the c*m smp or the egg smp?
Such an amazing video, warmed my heart to pieces. Ty to everyone who was their for us in covid and much more. You’ve inspired me to do things I never thought I could do and I can’t wait to see what everyone does next ❤
Rest in peace Dream smp u helped got thorugh allot
Ok bye
I love how to recommended video that appears is "I joined dreams server and now he hates me", the video that started it all..      rip dream smp, one of the, if not the best server ever created. o7
nah this hits deep
its like they say, don't be sad that it ended, just be happy it happened..
I can’t believe this made me cry.
Goodbye Dream Smp! We will always remember you
o7
Why
technoblade never dies
Watching Tommy’s channel grow through the Dream SMP was a huge part of growing up, seeing Tommy slowly go from young man to young adult, was amazing, during the last visit to Techno’s house, tears were pouring, goodbye Dream SMP, because without Techno, like Eret said on the traitor video, “It was never meant to be.” So one last time, TechnoBlade never dies!
I cried so much in the stream but I’m happy I could experience it. R.I.P Technoblade and stay strong dream SMP 💪🏻👋🏻
YAY ITS GONE 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I'm feeling so emotional after this video.. something similar happened to me too. Well, all good things come to an end and we are only left with memories. Technoblade was a huge part of my life he inspired me a lot too. TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
Thank you Dream SMP, and everyone who helped to make it happen. You don’t know how big of an impact you made, this was amazing. ❤️

I was saluting irl during the end, genuinely started to cry realizing that something that has helped me during my lowest has ended. o7 dsmp.
Good
RIP Dream SMP. Everyone on that SMP has made so many memories,  entertained viewers, It is heartbreaking to see the server close. RIP DreamSMP. ♥♥
Oh.
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I promised myself I wouldn't Cry. But this is the end of a Era. A new one will come soon, 07 to Technoblabe. And thank you so much for helping me through depression and now Highschool, the Dsmp did a lot, allowing me to meet new friends, find my passion and yo even get over things that happened in the past. But the tears I cry is a way of me letting go of the past not in bad memory but in a way of finally moving on to the next Era, I loved the Dsmp woth my whole heart. 07 Tea_0f_wounders signing out.
To quote Tubbo “its been a pleasure” 🫡
Who else misses techno type we miss you techno 👇
<3
07 to one of the best mc servers
I think I also speak for behalf of everyone when I say thank you for everything. I met most of my friends during this period. Thank you for everything. ❤
This made me cry, nothing will top the Dream SMP. Memories will be held here forever. o7, Dream SMP and Technoblade never dies.
bittersweet feeling:,)
techno never dies, he will live forever in our hearts...
Dream smp may be the best thing ever, it had so many memories so you can't even count. The fact that Dream created a place, connected people and did a lot of great stuff is just amazing. On the server forever will be the memory of Techno, and the things he did there. Dream smp actually changed my life forever and it may be silly but I appreciate it. I love the lore, duos and storytimes. There are so many of them, but will never be enough for me heheh. Thanks Dream smp and I hope someday something like this will happen again and it would be something incredibly sick.  o7 Technoblade 👑🔥❤️
Goodbye Dream SMP
Brb gonna rewatch the entirety of DreamSMP in order
Thank you
Thank you tommy you helped me through my Covid times and you helped me when my grandma died. POGGERS tommy. And rip techno
I really hope they can make new smps that will be just as good as this
Techno should have killed the dragon,But great job tubo.
The dream smp is the best sever ever
Dream smp changed my life its ending now sad to see it go😢
Time flies fast, even if it hurts it's still.... Beautiful... It's more like age. You start with nothing but then after years of your life, it's finally come to an end. It's time to start a new life. A new SMP. A new journey.... So boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen keep in mind, "don't cry because it ends, happy because it happens". And thank you Technoblade for everything, Technoblade never dies and so do you.
This is the gratest video of all time❤❤😂
This made me cry when they group pic and when it ended specially at technos house thank you for the memories dream smp🔥
I'm cryyy noo 😭😭😭
sad to see it go, but glad that it happened still! truly a product of both its time and insanely creative people getting together to do something special :] o7

well, thats that.
I'm sad now
Technoblade..... Never Dies.
The end of an era!!!❤❤
So sad to see it go for good but at least u guys made so many happy memories and its been a wonderful experience. RIP Dream SMP!
(6:20 8:26) 8:58 14:28 14:45 15:16 16:24
I guess u can say it was meant to be …
Damn I'm gonna cry😢😢
Dream doesn't even care anymore😭 I enjoyed the Dream SMP a lot and Tommyinnit ending it fits, yes it fits Thank you Tommyinnit and all of Dream SMP members
I cant sleep peacefully knowing sex is out there
Technoblade should have been here😢
Goodbye DSMP, it made me feel so alive and all fucked up this whole time XD And the visit of Techno's house is just- sad and all but i can still remember the moments he streamed there.   It literally made my life changed... Especially fucked up🗿 And uhm. I never commented to any of Tommy's vids, but this one is special bc I felt like I have to do it lol.  Welp goodbye, DSMP ( and Tommy I guess)
I was so sad that is the last one. I never made it so far that the best and lasted video
o7
im gonna miss this so much i been there from the start man
this made me cry
i watched the stream :D
The techno visit almost brought tears. Thank you for going there for one last time. Dream SMP always made a lot of us a reason to smile after a bad day. It will forever live on in our hearts.  o7
I can't believe the dsmp is now a "was" and not a "is" anyway, amazing era :)
Thank you, for everything.
I’m not crying ,you are :(   On a serous note tho, thx for everything, these last 3 years has been an amazing hell of a ride lol. This community has held me through a lot and to see it come to a beautiful end is a sort of bittersweet feeling. Seeing techno’s cabin really made me realize how much the people, the fandom, and the smp as a hole mean to me. Again, thank you for being there for me :)
I'm not usually a big fan of Tommy. But this, it brought closure to the thing that kept me going through Covid. Started watching after The Dawn of the 16th. Focused on Wilbur and Phil's PoVs. Thank you, Innit, for showing us that, for many. It really is over. Though the story is over, the legend will never die. The unfinished symphony is finished.
Can you tell us the ip now plss
What a journey I appreciate tommy for the entertainment through the years DreamSMP will be missed ❤
I’m sad that it over but happy that it happened. (R.I.P Techno ❤)
Saw something in Tommy's uhh thing when he was running away from Dream-
I'm curious, does this mean Tommy and the others won't be talking anymore? Take the mod videos for example
What If the Dream SMP Fought this time the Warden?
To think the reason i became Friends with one of the Best people i have met have come to an end and all the entertainment i got from all this , it feels like nostalgia and a little but of burden , but Also... It feels like growing up .
Good bye Dream Smp…Nice job Big Man !
I WAS HEREEE
Technoblade never die
;D
This was such a wholesome and emotional way to end the sever and honestly I’ve always struggled to watch streams due to lack of focus and yet this sever has been such a big part of my life and all of the creators have done so much for me and I think because of the Dream SMP I was happy though covid and when school got though I could always turn to all the amazing creators. I find it amazing all the creative shit that got started because of the Dream SMP and while change has always scared me and everything is changing maybe it’s a good thing because every good story has an ending so I’m gonna wait for the sequel. I’m excited for bigger better things to come and the good thing about this being online is it’s always there I can always come back to old streams on the vods channel or watch old videos and that comforts me. I would like to thank everybody involved with the dream smp whether content creator, someone who works behind the scenes, viewer, or some one who made their content based off the dream smp, just thank you, thank you for everything. Good bye Dream SMP thank you o7
Dream SMP changed my life, and it is sad to see it go but I'm just happy that it happened in the first place. and The visit to Technos house brought tears. Years of watching and the whole bringing him into the server to go against dream brought back some great memories. NOT EVEN CLOSE BABY NOT EVEN CLOSE TECHOBLADE NEVER DIES! ❤❤
I was getting emotional when he visited techno's place
Man I didn't think this would genuinely get me emotional. These two years really were fun.
Imagine an anime/real life movie/series based on dsmp....... I'd watch that....
👁️
Salute Boys
i will miss this..
this entire video was so emotional and the Techno part had me crying
The dream smp really helped me through my struggles during 2021 and its sad to see it gone but atleast we got clips
whats the song during the enderdragon fight? at 15:35
o7
Zelda theme at the end?? This is the definition of Cheff's Kiss.

This was an overall amazing series and I'm sad to see it go. But I am SO happy with what I got from it and the people in it. Overall GG to all you amazing streamers!

It was so sad to hear tommy trying to be funny but his voice just kept lowering visiting Technoblade's house, Rest is Peace king.

The dream SMP is one of the best things i have ever seen. It has changed my life and the way i look at it. I will and am always grateful for this server. Goodbye Dream SMP.
Goodbye DSMP. Rest well o7
Why was is it the last one ???
I’m fucking cring 😢 I’m so sad
Farewell Dream SMP. A rare experience that can't ever be replicated. Starting as this silly troll series to a full on scripted show. Nothing was like it at the time, it's the unexpected spark of creativity that will always make it stand out and be unique from the rest of the SMP's.
Man this sucks
Why no more SMP videos?
Imma miss it
Yall see the tears in his eyes
fun fact: tommy cried in the end of the stream 💀
i am waiting for techno to hit the respawn button . it will take us a few years to notice since humans dont have much functionality when they respawn
and what a crazy 2 years it’s been 😮
This was kinda emotional omfg I would never think this would make me emotional ily tommy (say it back)
Whelp time the get just as obsessed with QSMP :)) o7

Goodbye Dream Smp you will be missed a bunch😔
I remember being at a low point in my life. Then I was introduced to TommyInnit and the Dream SMP. I watch every video since Tommy joined it. And I’m heartbroken. It’s bittersweet. So many laughs. Seeing Techno’s house touched me. The last flicker before disconnecting was magical. Goodbye, Dream SMP. Thank you, Tommy, for all the laughs. You changed so many lives. -Tim
Thank you :)

...
This was the most memorable things I have ever seen' the nostalgia when I used to watch during covid, visiting Technoblades house and so much more, this was something I will never forget in my entire life and I am greatfull for all of the all the memories it had. its sad to see the Dream SMP go but you know what they say, all good things.come to an end.                       o7 Techno. Rest in Power.
I'm watching it all over again from the beginning. Because why the hell not. :D Man, i teared up, so amazing to realize for 2 and a half years they built all that, made so many memories. I want friends like these. o7, goodbye DSMP :>
o7
"Don't be sad that it's over, be glad it happened". Thank you to everyone on the Dream SMP for those wonderful 2 years of great memories
o7 to Technoblade and the dreamSMP U both will be remembered in history.
1:36
I didn’t cry during the Technoblade part Seriously. I mean come on, of course my lips were trembling a little and I could feel the tears forming but for the past half year I have accepted the fact that he wouldn’t have wanted us to find his death sad. That’s just obvious.  Of course, there is nothing we can do to prevent feeling the slightest bit of sadness when some of our favorite people die. I think that is why Tommy was laughing then started to cry a bit.  Mix of 2 very different emotions makes that part beautiful
Bro really signed out the last video by thanking himself ☠️☠️☠️ ultra common Tommy L
During lockdown the Dream Smp helped me so much to get through it as a distraction while also having some fun being in an amazing community. I think we are all so grateful and are sad to see it go but are so thankful for it. o7 Techno :'(. Thank you Tommy for this I think we all needed it for a nice way to finish it. Thank you :)
o7

Thank you mate, for everything <3
o7
Goodbye dream smp
My life feels empty now
Once upon a time a loud blond kid jumped into a small server, not knowing his entire career would kick off from there. Love ya, Tommy
When will u talk to drista?
Good night, Theseus.
It reminds me of Technoblade is this dead❤😢 rip Technoblade, never dies
sobbing
Good game, legends✌️
This smp saved me, it is sad to watch it end but also i feel somewhat happy it happened i wish it didn’t have to ends but it’s got to another chapter in mine and the smps lives. It’s happy to see you still never fail to make me laugh thank you tommy 🫶🏻
Farewell dream smp and all the memories especially techno
W 🔥
This is the end of dsmp, it'll always be in my heart.
o7
What happened to dreams voice :0 i just missed the whole face reveal thing
This video made me cry😭
is it me or dream sounds different
The last part was Beautiful long live the smp and technos house and the disc techno put there
13:30  Oh boi here we gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
My only regrets, is that the Egg arc never had a change to a well ending. By DreamSMP.
2 years ago i never thought i would cry from a tommyinnt video
17:20 the end of an era…
Good bye your like tecno 😥
Thank you, I can’t say it to Techno, so thank you for basically introducing me to his streams. The dream amp has been a major part of my life. Thank you
i started watching during quarantine 🥲
Genuinely cried through the whole video. I think we can all agree covid was very hard . But the dsmp really helped to get through it.  Thank you, Tommy. Thank you, dream . Thank you, everyone, on the server for making covid not suck that much  This will forever be one of my safe places I'd also like to thank the dsmp fandom for making all the incredible art and just everything that was extremely welcoming I met my best friends through this fandom. I couldn't thank this community more
Techno was the GOAT.
its been an honor to be apart of this community for the past few years.
I'm sad that Techno wasn't there. He was a legend and will always be. I'm glad that he was apart of the Dream SMP. If he weren't, then my life weren't have changed during the COVID season. It's wholesome that Tommy had the audacity to visit Techno's house for the last time. The Dream SMP changed my life even when I watched Techno for the first time. Goodbye Dream SMP<3
rest in peace dream smp
s
Thank you for all of the amazing memories from the dream smp. This server truly changed my life and got me though some of the toughest times. I will miss the series but I'm glad I got to experience this incredible journey in the first place.
Dream smp was not only a server or a normal smp it was full of fun, memories that always catch us in many ways. We will miss it...
Sad-ist gonna make this hit so much harder
:{ <3
Thank you for all the memories of the past and of the DREAM SMP… ❤
o fucking 7
I will miss it, RIP Techno.
The saddest vid long live technoblade
Tommy, I can't thank you enough for all the joy you've given me form watching your videos. Coming home from a bad day at school or just upset in the moment, I think I've come to you and your videos most of the time. Even though I don't have twitch and can't watch your streams and chat, I have the vods, the videos, and the memories from it all. This server has done a lot, for everyone on the server and for all its viewers. I'm so grateful I came across one of your videos and stuck with them. I know I'll miss the server, but I also know I'll cherish it and keep its memories for a long time. Thank you Tommy, just thank you. So much. I love your videos and how energetic you and your friends are. It brings the best laughs and fun :) Thank you Tommy :)
❤️❤️
I literary cried watching this. It makes me so sad to think that now there will never be another Dsmp video 😭
now so many people will finally have a reason to go outside
It sad 😔 seeing you leave all the memories behind, but I just want to ask, will you still be on youtube?? And, thank you for all the good memories you brought to all of us ❤️ ♥️
LETS FUCKING GOOO!!!!!
1:04 that’s not what technoblade said…
now I feel stupid for watching the entire vod
Has it really been 2 years? I remember watching Dream Smp during 7th grade and although I stopped watching around the prison arc, I still have good memories of watching the streams on Twitch. I really miss the simple times, although it was covid and everything sucked, this smp and the people on it made it so much better.
I found so many awesome youtubers because of dream smp, and visiting techno's house brought me to tears.i can't believe its ending.
Why did punz have part 3 of How To Sex 💀 i skipped some streams and chapters i believe...
*Farewell Dream SMP! Thanks for all the amazing memories.*
NOOOOOOO
I'm not crying you are
Season 2?
That's awesome!!🎉
It was so sad seeing you go back to techno’s house…🥲
This was an amazing part of my life, I'm grateful for the DreamSMP being in my life <3 I joined during the Festival Aftermath, and binge watched so many videos... I love how so many breaks were tied up, and o7 to Technoblade. So long, Dream SMP!
The technoblade part mad me big sad rest in peace legend we will never let your legacy die as long as we live
The best thing ever  good bye dream smp
techno never dies, this will be the last time i'd probably ever see his house again. :')
i want the world download  pleaseeeee i wanna explore the real dream smp
It’s bitter sweet memories, thanks guys, for the all the memories it was fun while it lasted ❤❤❤
Tf happened to eret💀🥃
The great memory of the SMP  never be forgotten. ❤
all my life watching the dream smp and i am just now crying about it
thank god
Thank you for making this great video to us tommy, ALL OF US. Dream SMP is been apart of me since u joined, I can't believe that  I've been watching Dream SMP for 2 years and a half. I'm so proud of y'all! I'm actually crying LMAO
🫡
For the past 3 ish years of my life from watching the dream SMP have been my best life ever even if it meant I had to deal with cyber bullying and being made fun of in school for enjoying it it never had brand me as much joy and tears to my eyes then anything else I’ve watched 💗💗💗
17:20 "YOU GUYS SHOULD KISS"
Thanks for the memories!
o7 to dream smp and all fucking 1000 of George’s cannon lives. But, what if, this isn’t the end? I mean, dream smp wasn’t named for the best mc player, bc Technoblade was alive at the time. So that means that any one of those, like, 70+ more content creators could start another one... you never know
well, no matter how much everyone disliked it, it's still sad to see it go. goodbye. rest in pepperonis
o7 techno
o7 ⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️
Goodbye forever
o7
The vibe for the Dream SMP died when Techoblade did, but im really sorry to see it go. All the memories, the laughs, the tears, i will never forget this server. Also, Tommy's last visit to Techo's house had me in tears. Thank you all for the memories!!!!!
one call from dream started that all :]
See I first watched this when I just finished 6th grade probably june-july 2020 and I was 12 then discovered various of content creators and SMP's but one stood out and that was dream smp just having that spark of passion, suspense etc. That turned the game into something new and something different I was 12 when it started and 15 when it ended what a journey
I will fully admit, I never actually watched much of the DSMP. I would watch an episode every now and then, but mostly I didn't keep up with it. That being said, it was still part of my life, and even if it wasn't, I wouldn't have hated it. It entertained people, and that's what really matters.
That moment where you went to technos house. Had me chocked up. Goodbye dream SMP 🫡
augghhh no idea how this made me cry so much. Visiting techno's house, them sitting on the bench, getting to see a lot of things for the last time. It just reminded me of how many good streams i watched, the late nights just to catch the UK streams, and just how many friends i met because we both watched Ranboo or Techno or someone else. Thanks so much for the good times. (Also anyone else hoping we get a Sadist video out of this?)  I usually dont sign comments because its never been that formal, but this seems right.  Here's to all the great adventures we've seen and the ones to come, Thank you,  - stARYNight
Takimitchi of dream SMP 🗿

Goodbye dsmp o7❤🎉
I love how at the end the recommended video was the first time Tom joined, just showing how far this SMP has come. We’ll miss you, r.i.p dream smp.
Dream SMP is my childhood, I would tell my son and grandson about this one day ❤
Looks like it the end of the SMP.
Two years I watched and theorized over this server. Two years that were the hardest of my life/ I'm sad to say goodbye, but I'll be telling this story for a long time.  o7
good bye DSMP
i wish techno was still alive for this it would make this video 1000x better.  dear tommy if your reading this can to make a sever called tommys smp.
Seeing Techno's house made my heart drop. It really has almost been a year already.
LITERAL CHILLS!! Tommy  I used to hate you but i've grown fond of your content. Never stop buddy.. Your doing great!
Over 2 years of streams and videos, so much fun and some sad moments... and now its finally done, this has  been one of the best series on YouTube for me and its sad for it to end. :(
Can't believe I spent a year of my life watching this server from time to time from like mid 2020-2021. Then I started watching Techno again in like mid 2022 and a week later, things happened and everything just felt different.
It still feels like it was yesterday.   Goodbye, Dream SMP.
Wow. This server was so incredible. There were/are so many fun memories and moments. Through tears and laughter, this server held it all. Thank you Tommy 🫡
10:41 Techno: Im not sure about that one
I started watching the dream smp 2 years ago and now I’m the age you where when you first started streaming on the dream smp  16 turning 17 this year
best 17 minutes of my life o7 Dream SMP
R.I.P. Technoblade
Good bye dreamsmp o7 it was an amazing two years since I started watching it 😢
Congrats on a server well run You gave us delight  I look forward to our partnership
Dream SMP got me through the the pandemic and some hard times. Thanks for all the laughs these past few years!
I joined the dream SMP fandom and it has saved me so many times at my lowest, it's sad to see it end but in glad for all the memories. Good bye dream SMP and o7 technoblade.
Dream has Techno's Crown. It's quite nice.
Through all the tough times I went through during covid, I always knew I could just escape and watch my favorite people stream. As covid started going away and I started healing. I would be with my best friend, seeing Tommy or tubbo or any of them streaming, and always smile because I knew they were helping people through their dark times<3 I grew up with dream SMP and I would not have it any other way. It has truly made me the person I am. I met one of my best friends because of it, and I will continue to always have my connections back to it as it was such a big part of my life. Thank you, Dream SMP, for everything.
o7 L'Manberg o7 Technoblade o7 The Dream SMP  o7 to the awesome memories made due to this server, for the players and the viewers. Covid wouldn't have been manageable without it all.
Dream smp is what made me who I am today, I <3 dsmp..
why the hell did i cry when i saw you go to techno's house gg tommy Goodbye
Good bye 👋
:(
this SMP got me trough covid
Never forget techno 07
❤❤
this is the most wholesome thing ive watched in a long time and to think it was a tommy video
I. I don’t know what to say. Oof I guess, that really hit me. It’s really over.
Fuck I really wanna cry.
Dream SMP Good Bye for you had Great Memories and Funny Moments.
I will miss this damn server, this changed my life forever. I was just an average kid before the Dream SMP, and now I feel like it has changed me. Thank you Dream SMP. 💚🖕🏻
o7
This was likely the most emotional I have ever gotten to the finale of anything. From banning Dream, to visiting Technoblades house, this video was such an emotional roller coaster.
Why does it have to end tho? 😢
rip
I am getting mixed signals. Is this the last video EVER? or no cause it feels like it is the last video ever
The dsmp has shaped who I am today. My humor, hobbies and favourite content creators sprouted from this very server.  Of course there were some weird people in the fan base and controversy circling around the dsmp, but we also can't forget the fan base (the not so negative one) like the people who would spend hours at a time watching or expressing their interests.  This server saved lives, helped people during their darkest moments and is now just a memory from our childhood. I feel like no matter if you're a hate or fan, we should all appreciated how much this server has provided for people. Thank you dsmp.
I loved the inclusion of Celeste music in the end fight
I‘m in tears again 😢
Good riddance
It was a good ride
o7
I am so sad techno is not here to have some last moments
damn… i didn’t even watch dream smp that much, maybe just a stream here or there towards the beginning, but me and my friends had a realm during covid that was so similar to this, in that it had landmarks and memories and so many other things that made it so special. we played it almost every day during covid, but life moved on, and there’s this quote about not knowing it’s the good ol days until it’s over. this video made me so nostalgic for that realm, i miss it
Goodbye Dream SMP!!! Thank you for all the memories and giving entertainment in the dark times of covid! o7 o7 o7  Also. TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!!
I wish technoblade was here to go through the last day of the dream smp......while he visited techno's home it brought tears and I'm sure a lot of u has cried in that time too.......TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!!!!!!!
Good luck Tommy
Ty for the memories tommy Also how do you use copyright music? Any advice
I havebeen here for 2 years and the dsmp has come to an end. Sobbing, crying, devastaded 😢
I cried.... tommy was my reason to get up all of covid I knew the steam would start and he would make my whole day better
o7 dsmp you were a bug impact in my life i  will miss you as well as many others it was a heck  of a ride❤
It has been an honor waching you Tommy  thanks for all the funny streams and over theses last few years it's been really tough with covid. But anyway  Thank you Tommy and hope for the best and. Beyond.....
o7
I cry when this video end💓😥😥😥😢😢
No way he says the hotel is bad, then builds his house like that.
I was there when this whole thing happened. Nostalgia 😂
I never cried this hard…
I’m not crying you are!!
Im not even a big damp fan and this made me so sad
Thank you so much for knowing dream SMP. This video makes me feel many memories and thoughts. Good night, SMP.🥲
I hate dsmp fans but I enjoyed the series, something memorable is gone now

I honestly can’t put into words of how much this server and you meant to me in the height of quarantine. I always looked forward to whatever chaotic mess you were going to stream on the server and I’m forever going to be grateful for the memories that has came from it. Thank you so very much for your insane character and the dedication that you have put into it. I wish you the best of luck for your future projects, and once again, thank you. o7💫
Dream SMP got us all thru lockdown 🥹
Well, this made me cry.
If only technoblade could have just joined REST IN PEACE KING TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIESSSSSS
o7
lol
ohhh see ya later!
absolutely sobbing, I recently started re watching these videos purely for nostalgia and this vid definitely broke me. the editing was really well done, the fact that you went to you and technos old house. everything about this video was great and I wish i could’ve seen the live on twitch
The best last video of ever seen I was crying half way halfway through the video I think this is the best video I’ve ever seen. I love you Tommy Byeeee😢
i’m crying and it’s YOUR fault.
I love that you spent the last day with tubbo ❤
This is to hard. My life feels like it's fading  away. Please don't leave forever tommy please.
Ironic how Tommy killed Dream with TNT on the Finale 😂😭
currently sobbing. the dream smp took up 1/7 of my life and i will never forget it. thank you for all of the memories.
I started crying when he was at techno’s😭
i’m gonna miss this server so much but all good things must come to an end
Will you not make yotube videos forever
❤❤❤
Dream SMP brought me so many friends and fun times. In fact I can thank this SMP for bringing me closer to the ones I love most. I know it's a bit of an embarrassing thought, but this era has literally changed my life for the better. I stopped being a Dream SMP fan about a year ago, but seeing this just brought all those memories back. I cried multiple times throughout this video, and the final resolution of c!Tommy and c!Tubbo saying goodbye for the final time looking right at each other, in the place that they loved most, it's just a beautiful note to end on such a life changing narrative.  Thank you Dream SMP and all of its members, editors, donators and supporters for making all of this happen💜
So this is the end
time flies so fast man I can't belive this was the last Dream SMP video man but still TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIESS!
The server that was apart of all our lives. Many ups and downs. Rest in peace Techno. I’m know that you were there for the dragon fight, cheering them on from above. We will all miss this place.
Now the question is, what content will you choose to do next?
😢❤️
the last flicker through the screenshots really solidified it gg
The dream smp helped me and so many other throughout the pandemic.  I'll never forget it I'll never forget the major lore event on my birthday the day I started watching I'll never forget the beautiful builds  and I will never forget the people.  Thank you dream smp.
Techno's house is basically a limimal space now, everything is there, but there's something or *someone* is missing...probally forever
YOU MUST KEEP MAKING VIDEOS
Love u dreamsmp. It helped me cope with stress and laugh during hard times. Love all the people in it and going to miss this era. Miss u dreamsmp!
byers
the montages and everything were so nostalgic </3
make another mod video
I was here 😭😭😭🎉 Thank you for the memories gonna look at this comment after 5 years and remember each and every moment again. o7❤❤
Goodbye Dream SMP, you were the best group on YouTube.
o7
I havent heard dream in a while wtf happened to his voice why he hit puberty now?
This really made me realize i became a man watching this back during covid. There will never be anything like this that matters so much. I grew up around this and it's sad to see it go. The techno house visit had me shed a tear or two. Thanks for the great memories
Tommy please dont end dream SMO
o7
This stream was kind of hard to watch, especially when tommy went to visit technos base. It almost feels like...with the server being finally over for real, and knowing that we'll never see it again, means techno is really gone. It sort of felt like as long as the server was still active and all the things he did there were still there, it was like *he* was still there. But now he's really gone.
There are a millions things I could say- so many memories and moments that mean so much to me that I teared up a bit towards the end, so I think I’ll just say goodbye with a simple BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD- long live the blade and I’m so thankful for everything this server did and how many hearts it touched. o7- you will be remember dream SMP. Goodbye.
LETS FUCKING GO IM SO HAPPY🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊
Rip techno
I am literally crying
Damn that kinda hurt
MAN
i can’t believe it’s the end of the dream smp. it was such a big part of my life and it’s crazy to see it ending. it brought me so much joy during covid and now it’s gone
I’m bawling my eyes out rn the dream smp literally saved my life and I wouldn’t trade peak dsmp era for anything😭😭 So sad to see it go but I’m so happy I got to be there.
This Video Really brought back some old memories. We all miss him[ ❣Technoblade Never Dies❣]
the way i had tears in my eyes when he visited techno’s cabin
Nah instead of logging off they should’ve had dream steal the disc again that would be a great ending
LETS GOOO
Ameee los amo gracias por tanto
Good bye dream smp.. I will always love the videos of the dream smp.
Goodbye dsmp.. my favorite thing to watch..when I was feeling down.. y’all made me laugh so much
Its really sad that this is all over, i may not have been as engrossed as everybody else but it was great to have to have during quarantine.  I’m gonna miss the content.. I really am but anyway i hope y’all can still make content together with eachother
What a great send-off to a great era.
SAD IST WHERE ARE YOUUU

Thank you everyone whether it be chat tommy or dsmp members thank you. I will forever be grateful for the memories i got just watching. And remember everyone dont be sad that it is over, be happy it happened. :) o7 Dream SMP and o7 Technoblade :) I enjoyed my stay did you guys? :,)
thank you for stopping by techno's house. it really took me back to the height of the server because I usually only watched techno live on the dsmp. that really meant a lot to me. im sure if he was still here he would've loved to kill/troll everyone in the servers final moments.  the impact this server had on the mc community is insane. and, despite me not being into dsmp for a long while, id love to go back and experience it and the hype surrounding it once more.  farewell dream smp. may you and all your memories never be forgotten. o7
Goodbye Dream SMP!
im so sad about no more dream smp and its been such a long journey for all of us that watch it. rip dream smp

"Shoot the woman, shoot the woman in the sky." - Tom Simons, 2023
i cried
Can't wait for another covid!
Dream smp is my therapist  Thank you dream smp Here since day 1.
I will forever miss the Dream smp, for it has changed my life 😢 💚
Hey Tommyyyy, I'm not sure when you are gonna see this but... After watching the whole entire livestream, I was so emotionally happy and thankful for all the videos you have made in the Dream SMP. It's been a great pleasure to be there, watching you play and having the greatest times you have had. You will always have a special place in my heart man. You mean the absolute world to me. Thank you so much Tommy. Yours truly, Levi <3
We were all here everyone

Pk
the celeste music at the end was epic
The way this made me cry so much is so unreal
Just killed a Gogy, Feelin gud!
Why am i so fucking sad????????
During COVID i would watch techno’s streams about this. I’ve grown out of the community after the news. I wish techno would have been here for this. He always made my day better
I can’t believe it’s almost been a year since techno passed away(295 days) when you visited his house brought tears. But I just wanna say thank you for all that y’all have done whenever I am feeling down these videos make me happy they make me laugh and smile so thank you. ❤❤
I'm sorry

technoblade in heaven: TOMMY GET OFF MY PROPERTY RIGHT THIS SECOND
Well another channel of the SMP has ended in tears
The visit to Techno’s house really hit hard, o7
Goodbye, Dream SMP 😢✋
also omg so sad
This really hurt.
At 16:32 that hit my heart I'm going to miss the Dream smp it was long journey from 2020 through 2023. Man it's been rough, fun, depressing, well basically this server has been all those things we fans watched these amazing events happened from the beginning it was just a normal survival world but loom at it now it has become a place full of adventure moments that were exciting and depressing tommy, tubbo they been through so much the disc war. L'manberg revolution, doomsday, the prison, Dream they went through depressing things along the way but that never stopped them if you look at the server this server has become a place full of memories those who lost all their 3 lives there not gone they are simply waching over us from the beginning tommy was a child that's likes to grief but now tommy has become something more than that he became a symbol that no matter how many people push you hurt you tormented you he has been through those depressing moments but that didn't stop I mean look back when tommy stuck in a situation he finds a way to beat the odds sometimes It never worked but he still kept on trying and eventually he did it. The villains of the story they were not villains they are just broken people remember dream was never bad at the beginning but since tommy came things change but at the end they get along they understand each other in their own way. But the only wish we wanted is techno to be there with them but he's not gone because he's always in our hearts and it will stay like that life and death. But I want to say  Thank you dream smp for a giving us an amazing story❤  Sincerely, dark moon
Goodbye dream smp
gootbye
Am i the only one who had a HUGE emotional breakdown during this😢
Joined April 2021, thank you for making the past 2 years for me amazing
I'm not drounding in my own tears, you are 😔
Visiting Techno’s house made me start tearing up once again…it’s such a wholesome display of memories with him..o7 ❤️🕊️ TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!! Thank you Tommy. :)
I didn't think I would cry to Techno's house. Techno never dies
RIP the blade, anyone know the seed?
Not me tearing up during this video 😭
Slay
Thank you for everything Tommy
hearing tommyinnit say "Jesus Niki, i have a girlfriend" makes me feel old
Fuckin hell bro I miss techno .
This was the most wholesome thing I’ve seen on YouTube. I’m so sad that this is over, I mean we all practically grew up on this! Well, goodbye Dream SMP o7 😔
"The rise and the fall of the dream SMP."  "A wide world of sorts."  "A place made for friends."  "A place full of shorts."  "The L'manburg war, The fights with dream." "Such a perfect place it would make you scream."  "As it started to get slow and the finale came to play,  "some glad it ended some wished it would stay"   "For we all were sad"  "And our breath taken away,"  "as we saw everybody disconnect"  "on their last final day."  Goodbye DreamSMP. You will always hold a place for us. Technoblade never dies.
it was a good two years
truly feels like the end of an era. thanks for the fun<3
I remember back during lockdown, I was so bored and I was stuck inside. But this SMP and these videos kept me entertained, from the stupid immature jokes to the genuinely interesting plot lines, to the incredible fan-made animations! Even if it’s not really popular anymore, this SMP will always have a special place in my heart for being the thing that inspired me to start doing content creation of my own. And also of course, the series that kept me sane during quarantine. Thank you Tommy, and everyone else who was a part of this server. I don’t wanna go as far as to say you changed my life, but you sure as hell made a dent.
dream smp has changed my life, i will forever hold it very close to my heart o7
Seeing this on stream was a truly memorable experience. It took me back to a time before the lore, when it was just people joking around. This was full circle.
Was incredible to be there throughout the entire Dream SMP moments live. Also the visit to Techno's house was such a moment that would bring tears to anyone, just reminding every moment the entire SMP had with him and his outstanding way of entertaining and knowledge. Was a great server
1:26 this was funny cause the book said marry Christmas so we don’t even know how long that was in there for 😂
Goodbye two years of beautiful chaos o7
Sad …but POG
I was never watching the DSMP streams as they came out, only just finding it a year and a few months ago and only being interested in the L’manberg and Pogtopia times, all the war. Nevertheless it still has been a huge part of my life, helping me find my favorite YouTubers (you, Wilbur, etc) and seeing it come to an end, despite not knowing all of the story, it still is pretty emotional.   o7, my friends. Hope to see something great come again. o7.
You can tell how hard Tommy was trying to hide his tears while visiting Techno's house. Tommy, if you read this, there is no need to hide your feelings, we understand and sympathize for you, especially since you and Techno were so close.
Technoblade never dies We still miss you The last time going to Techno's house resurfaces some memories 😭Can't believe there will never be another Techno video and that he is gone forever
2:45 Bottom Text
Man this hurt to watch. All those memories brought me a smile and now it is the time to say goodbye to it.
Season 2 when
I'm sorry to say Tommy Ramboo is actually the main character dubbed by Tecknoblade who is the sensi.
Even though i was never the most active in the DSMP i still made a point to binge the episodes i missed during covid, and seeing all of this was just so moving. from the visit to technos house to them sitting where they always sat, it really felt so unreal. i cant believe it’s really over… love you guys ❤️
i havemt watched dsmp for almost a year but this still brought back so many memories
When he visited technos house I started to cry I was here since the beginning and it really is beautiful
I'M FUCKING CRYING!!!
This SMP felt like the kind of dream you never wanna wake up from, the DreamSMP has honestly helped me so much, emotionally and creatively. I don’t think I could ever put enough words into how much it’s meant to me. The memories will never die. So long, everybody. 🤍🫡
The Dream SMP has been a big part of all of our lives. I am so grateful that I was able to view the best moments of the SMP. It’s definitely cheered me up during hard times during life and I’m so happy that it existed. Thank you for making our lives so much better and cheering us up when we were sad or upset! We all love you and will support you in everything along the continuous journeys. ❤️  P.s. The visit to Techno’s made all of us tear up, especially when Tommy wiped his eye on the journey home. 😕
😢 rip dream smp
Don’t be sad that it’s over be happy it happened
13:12 I didn’t watch much of the early disk wars, before L’Manburg, but this.. felt kinda nostalgic.
It sure was fun visiting his friends house talking to them having memories if only in the future I wish it would be just like this again...
T-T
Why does this have to be your last video I enjoy you content so much
Well it’s been fun thank you for two years I didn’t expect to tear up at techno’s house but yeah I did great video Tommy and farewell dsmp
one of the greatest and saddest goodbyes ever
im sad
Goodbye Dream SMP
lol the ban reminded me of the blip
Techno is getting sponsored even in death. What a based fella
The End Of An  Era.
Im not crying you are😭😭😭
Thanks for everything tommy. Thanks to you, the dream SMP was one of the best things on my life. I can't describe how I'm feeling now, so happy and so nostalgic at the same time o7
I appreciate you using the same music as Schlatt did in his SMP Live finale.
Actually insane. Have only been keeping up with lore in patches since the disc saga finale, the OTHER finale got me in the feels, and now this. I mean I feel like so many people have said, and I’ve said, yea the smps over now, but now it actually is. o7 to the crazy artists, the creators themselves, the whole fandom in general over the past few years (for better or worse), and Techno. Minecraft’s awesome.
Wait does that mean we might get more origins smp?
O7
Why did I cry watching two block game people watching block game sunset 😭😭😭
This was hard to watch, so funny yet so serious. Rip techno never dies
o7
May this amazing series take its place among the stars, and may Techno be there to greet it like an old friend
nooooo you were myinsperatoin and it was such a good server
Wait til Saddist makes an animation about this
you don't want to know how much I cried because of this
LETS FUCKING GO
o7
All the memories we shared will be in our hearts forever. I am so grateful to have experiance this wonderful server with yall. I could not have it any other way. I found so many great youtubers, content creators and the fanbase with so many talented artist, writers, singers and more.   Thank you Dream SMP, for being there when the world was going to shit. We'll miss you  P.S I was there when DNF clips kept circling around and it showed the beginnings of the Dream SMP, then Tommy's first time in the server. How time passes by man!
😢i love the techno house visit
Goodbye Dream SMP. To all the memories created To all the friends and enemies made All the kingdoms, and cities destroyed and rebuilt To the wars fought To the AMAZING community To the happiness and joy And sadness and anger This place felt like a home, whether or not I was truly there So again DSMP Community Thank you.
NOOOOOOO. I will  miss the Dream smp and all the content. but 2 things are facts.1 TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES, and 2 l'manburg FOREVER.
NOOOOOOOOֱֱֱֱֱ!!!!!!!
I like to imagine this is the canon ending and the entirety of the dsmp was just a shitty dream based off bits of reality no one can stop me. unless a member of the dsmp finds my comment and says otherwise- but then again we all decided sbi was canon bc haha angst go brr so oh well
im crying rn, i felt like i formed those memorys with you.
o7
This… was the end of a ride. Which has lasted forever..

This server had meant so much to me over covid and it kept it really happy while the world was pretty shit. I started crying when you visited technos house I feel like just seeing his house and seeing all the things he left behind and the disc I presume he left for tommy just brought me to tears. It's so sad to see this server go but alas all good things must come to an end. :)
The world is healing🎉🎉🎉
I miss techno :(
WAIT HE IS NEVER STREAMING AGAIN? WHAT? HUH? HELP? WHAT? UH? WAIT?
I wasn't here for any of it but I'm still glad
Now i don’t know how to feel about this, I am now wonder why the dsmp is ending, if someone could tell me why it’s ending I would be at least know why it’s ending
Goodbye DreamSMP,  you will forever hold a place in my heart.  Technoblade never dies.  <3
This video is so nostalgic 😢
This is quite emotional.
Dream SMP changed my life, and it is sad to see it go but I'm just happy that it happened in the first place.
You bitch, you brought me to tears
This truly has been an smp with dream in it
itd be sooooo funny if you guys let us download the map
Congratulations to all of you on the stories you told with this server. Genuinely impressive what you guys collectively crafted and built as a result
WE WILL MISS YOU 😢❤
This was heavy
In this video I cried I laughed I cried and laughed again. This is so fucking awesome Dream SMP saved me from my loneliness in the time of pandemic. and also TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
Crying 😭
I am so overjoyed and I’m like crying I’m really gonna miss dsmp I’ve been watching it since it started and I’m so sad it’s over but so happy it happend. When you visited technos house it was so amazing thank you tommy.
This was the biggest tear jerker of my life I love your content
when he blew up the hotel I though he was going to say it was never meant to be.
😢I love the SMP
:(
i didn’t expect to actually cry to this, but the dsmp has been such an important part of so many peoples life’s that it’s so sad to see it end.
no :( i didnt think about how everything that techno touched and built was gonna be left behind
Is this really the end?
here since the exile arc, it has been a journey.
You could see sadness at tommy's eyes in the last part
New idea: FORTNITE ?!?!?!
Tommy: ARE YOU READY FOR THE GREATEST MLG OF ALL TIME?!! Tubbo: Wait what? where are you? Chat: TommyInnit fell from a high place Tubbo: Oh.... Oh, Oh...
“Read how to sex”💀
When you went to Techno's house, I began crying. It was perfect, all the memories of the Dream SMP and the music in the background when you visited his house... the subscriber bell. It still hurts to this day, but we just have to learn how to move on at some point, but it was a good reminder of all the memories this server has and what an impact it had on all of us. Thanks Tommy. Techno Never Dies... 😥
Hi
rest in peace you chaos, story filled smp.
Awh, it hurts my heart knowing this is *the end* of the dream smp. The memories were great, and i'm so glad i joined this fandom. I joined during the SWAG2020 and POG2020 election. Honestly, i'm going to rewatch the DSMP streams over and over again.
Tommy: I have never cried on stream and I never will.  Later Tommy After Visit To Techno's House: 🥲❤ 👑
Here before it ended 👇
9:00 hogh houghhough hough
Thank you Tommy.  For streaming the Dream SMP during the pandemic and giving me a sense of routine waiting for your strems to start and for making this video. Goodbye Dream SMP o7
1:06 - I just *_love_* how he contradicts himself (and his entire video [idea] setup) *_literally_* 1 minute into the video!!!! 😂 🤣
Thank you for everything. Including you Technoblade
I never even watched the DSMP and I’m sobbing
o7
All dreams must eventually be awoken from.
o7
Looking back 2 years ago, when i started watching Tommy's streams. i realized a new world unfolding and it changed me, it changed us all..  The Dream SMP was the thing we didn't ask, but needed in our lives. i couldn't be more thankful that we all are a part of this amazing journey, i couldn't be more thankful that it changed my life.  Thank you Tommy, Thank you Dream SMP. 👑
I kicked off the Fanlore pages for MCYT and the DSMP, which spurred other editors to just this year start making a ton of other MCYT pages to collect the fandom's movement. Surreal seeing it come to an end. I was a wild and enjoyable ride watching videos of it and content creator vids, with accompanying fanart, fanvids, commentary, to build wiki articles out of :) There was really nothing quite like it.
Beautiful
I'm really crying right now.. I cry so rarely but this was too emotional..  never going to see the Dream SMP again the memory of Technoblade  the lore the fun i will never forget it ans if one day i have kids i will show them the Dream SMP for it to still being alive if others heart even if everything has ended ♡
As all who forgot tecnoblade dislike but....if u did not forget tecnoblade like ❤😊
Dude, I’m have just cried like 2 time and I never think I’ll get this emotional ever again 😭😭😭
Goodbye Dream SMP  Technoblade never dies
спасибо я плачу
crying, vomiting, sobbing, dying, falling down the stairs, rolling around, dont know what to do, throwing a tantrum,
The end of an era
Promised myself I wouldn't cry but, whatever. We'll miss the dsmp. We'll never forget The legend.. Technoblade. Goodbye dsmp. We'll never forget the memories.
Techno blade never dies
Funni-innit

Really enjoy this video Tommy. Thk u BIG MAN
0:20 Read how to sex- 💀
9:00 was too savage
i never really liked dream smp.. fuck i dont like dream at all. but you made it feel good, seeing all the goofy or stressful moments that i watched... mostly from techno's perspective. thank you for visiting his home, one last time. may he rest knowing he did more than enough in his short time. thanks, tommy. youve earned more respect than i initially had for you.
Man… I knew the Dream SMP lore had ended… But I didn’t expect the last video to effect me so much…
<3333333
It was a good run 👍
Damn. It all went by fast didnt it?
As much as i dont like dream, his smp was better for others than for him
man this was amazing, o7
It would be amazing if we had TECHNOBLADE in This last moments ❤😔
wat dream SMP content was good technoblades was the best
:)
pain
i guess all good things really do come to an end, don't they?
good bye❤
What a finale! What a journey!  Yet… it’s finally over…  So long Dream SMP, it’s been legendary… Techno never dies!
This was such an amazing journey Thank you all for bringing joy to us We will never forget this journey.
Goodbye my home.....I'm always going to miss the DreamSMP......
I'm the only comment that isn't heartwarming and inspiring : D
thank you
Dang, some things dont last forever. RIP DREAM SMP!
I Watch Your Videos
Tecno`s house broke me down😅😢😢😢😢😢
Techno part hit hard 😢
hi future ava n charlotte
The dsmp meant so much to me, maybe even a little to much but still- these past 2 years have felt like a fever dream-   In the middle of 2020-, I got recommended with a Tommyinnit video then I got introduced with dsmp. When I was feeling sad, I always looked forward to a dsmp stream, filled with jokes and lore  Though now I have gone past the dsmp era, I still have so much love towards it. Seeing it now finally end- like no more streams or content about it- now brings so many tears
Aw man, I remember discovering this server thanks to Wilbur’s first video on it, since I’d been watching him almost since the beginning, and I just can’t express enough how thankful I am to this server for introducing me to all these content creators. Especially you Tommy, you’ve grew to become my favourite YouTuber and your vids *never* fail to get at least one laugh out of me. You’re only a *month* older than me and you’ve achieved so much, it’s honestly inspiring! I’m really going to miss this server, the storyline, and fan content it spawned, but I can’t wait to see what comes next for you guys, cause I know no matter what, you guys will make it enjoyable, your dynamics and chemistry are like no other! Thankyou Dreamsmp, and fly high Techno you left us way too soon. ❤ 🕊️o7
And they say its just a game but it's not if you get attached to it basically the equivalent of taking care of a dog until it dies
*Anyone gonna talk about Dream trying to wake up George 😂XD*
14:46 This Reminds Me Off Just Killed A Woman Feeling Good😂
BOTTOM TEXT-
Then Technoblade Joined the game  "Where'd Everyone go?"  R.I.P. Techno He'll never die
Omg I wish if you made it public and made people go wars over protecting the land of DreamSMP from bad players. There would be so much content.
Goodbye dream smp o7
HEELLLOOOOOOO
Honestly that visit to Techno's house was the closest I've gotten to crying in a while. Technoblade Never Dies! ❤❤❤
NOOOO I CAN'T BELIEVE DSMP IS FINALLY OVER😭😭😭
THANK FUCK💪💪💪
I never really watched the smp, bu this still hits hard…
I have only one thing to say:  o7
I'm crying
Ur channel is dying
FINALLY NO MORE
Thank god it is dead
I actually cried so hard when you went Techno’s house
love the lil ":D" "D:<" ":'D" emoticons added in the captions, cute
Oh! Did you use the same music Schlatt used when he killed the Ender dragon on SMPLive to kill yours? Throwback I swear
This smp has been one of the best things that I have had the experience to see and watch from the start. Great job everyone thank you for all the laughs, jokes and seeing new friendships grow. Goodbye Dream smp.
Haven't watched or been in the fandom much since the egg lore but I'm really grateful that I found all of this, especially during pandemic times. This video brought back that feeling I got from the those original days of vids and streams like the giddiness was me 2 years ago. The last bit was pretty cinematic, really hit that nail in the head. The impact that this SMP and all of the creators is immeasurable. Eternally grateful for being able to be along for the ride. Thank you
This is so sad :(
tbh i never really got myself into the dream smp but it's still sad to see such a great server go.
Damn this felt so weird. I'll miss this series
Wowza

Dreams Voice Became So Manly Now 😢
I never realized I missed Techno this much until Tommy visited his house
Goodbye Dream SMP
This is actually sad this was a pretty big part of my time in covid lock down it’s been an honour to be apart of this experience o7 o7  It’s been a pleasure o7
technoblade would be grateful too  because he met peoples that bring him to do the dream SMP and do stuff together that I don't even know. we all miss technoblade. I wish I can play in the next dream SMP that dream bout to make. even tho I only have TLauncher, but still.  welp, (sigh) we'll miss dream SMP and techno. TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!
Yknow, Badboyhalo has actually cussed. My sister found a video where he cussed.
“I don’t remember spawn being so…✨gay✨” 8:09
Damn this hit hard I cured during it mainly at the end I remember being in Covid lockdown watching you all all the time it was my way of forgetting the bad stuff and when you visited technoblades house that was so sad I’m so glad I got into this fandom
Tubbo is side character
You visiting Techno’s house already had me tearing up, but you finding a disc in there? I’m bawling my eyes out
I do quite enjoy Tommy’s taste in music anyway. He uses Celeste osts occasionally and I appreciate that lol
Sad
This made me cry. Even if I didn’t watch the whole series. I love every bit of it
O7
I can't believe it's been almost 3 years, feels like yesterday I was discovering the DSMP. It was real, it's was fun, it was real fun.
Thank you, Tommy, and everyone else apart of the SMP, you have made the last 2 years the best things ever. I will miss seeing these lore streams, but even if there will never be another stream, I will... we all will have the memories.   The Dream SMP helped me so much, from my bf breaking up with me, to techno passing (o7 king). And I'm so glad I got to see and experience this while I could. and now if you will excuse me, Imma go cry my eyes out :')    Thank you all! o7 Technoblade and o7 Dream SMP.
Ngl Tommy kinda lookin like Kenny from Love is Blind season one in this video
Long live the Blade
sadge
crying
So long, DSMP!  It feels weird to know that something that feels like it’s been around forever finally met its end. To think in a couple days the server would be 3 years old too! I will never forget the memories I’ve gained in here and I will forever be grateful for this community.   Thank you, Tommy, thank you to all the other members of the Dream SMP for making these last 2 years less lonely. Thank you so much ❤.
I liked the smp even tho it was scripted
When real Men cry😔
I can feel it, I hear Techno saying "STEALING FROM A DEAD MAN ARE U TOMMY"
I can fell Dream and He's member will comment Pin me Tommy Soo they know
Finally
We will miss the Vid  of the Dream SMP and  all the memories from the pass 2 years goodbye🥺🤧♥️🇵🇭
thank you dsmp for everything. all the memories, everything.   Technoblade never dies!!!
This is just everyone’s childhood here and it’s so devastating how we all have to say goodbye. But just think about how all of them feel. Of course they feel a break but what about the memories it’s so sad but it’s a new beginning.
After all the streams i still cant believe it has ended o7 o7 o7 rip techno
It's so sad );
Good bye Dream SMP you were truly the best

Wow that hurt
This is what I watch everyday during the covid19
I AM GOING TO CRY'
Dream smp will not be replaced!!!!! It’s dream’s turn to be replaced!!!
ITS SO TOUCHING
hi
This Series Will Never Be Forgotten ❤

"Don't cry because its over, be happy because it happened"   -Dr seuss
Crying in the club
o7
Tommy’s face when he found His stuff… fuck me that hurts man😭
o7
Somethings do have a happy ending
After watching the whole hour stream, this made me start crying again. I’m rlly gonna miss the Dsmp, a big part of my life is bc of it and I will always love it
Ive been following the series since the start of the smp, and I loved all of it. Sad but glad to see it go
I wonder why we didnt see wilbur
Sam
Tommy really was the first to truly bring this server to life, and to see him give it the proper end it deserved is truly special. The first time I found DSMP was SAD-ist's WAR video, and I HAD to know what it was about. Tommy's videos were the only ones I could find about it at the time. I HATED his videos. I FOUND HIM ANNOYING- at first. And then Eret's betrayal happened and I was HOOKED on the way the video presented that moment. (PS- thanks for including Eret in this vid, she deserves all the love and without him I never would've stuck around lol) Tommy's content grew on me like the moss on cobblestone he liked to snack on. I love the way he's loud and silly and funny and just such a gremlin raccoon boy. Thanks, Tom. Thanks for giving us c!Tommy. Thanks for L'manburg. For SBI. For an amazing story we'll never forget. For bringing together a community and introducing people to friends through the enjoyment of your stupid, annoying, silly content. Can't wait to see whatever you make next Big Man. All the love <3 PS: Technoblade never dies. That cat disc was in there for some reason, and I like to think the reason is Techno leaving you a gift, proud e-brother style. also technomerch shoutout LETSGO
I'll miss it, but it was beautiful and lore filled.   Even if the Dreamsmp is gone, I know I shall never forget it, for the memories will forever be in my mind.  Goodbye Dreamsmp o7
WHYYYY
Thank god
"Dont cry because it ended, smile because it happend" this was so nostalgic. R.I.P DSMP❤ you changed lives
Thank you Dream SMP for all the memories that you given us. Thanks to all the players that played it and brought joy and laughter to us fans. You made the covid-19 pandemic feel like a dream. And now it's time to wake up. The last few years made this one of the biggest moments in our lives and that will never be forgotten. Thank you again and always, Technoblade never dies.
Thank you for the view of technos house that will be my wallpaper till the end of time TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES !!!!
Even if I was never all that invested enough to watch everything, I was mostly there for the lore, but I still enjoyed watching what I did and will miss this chaotic server
FINALLY 🔥🔥🔥
AAAAA I CRIED WHILE WATCHING THE LAST BIT. THANK *YOU* FOR EVERYTHING TOMMY. but in all seriousness, its been really surreal with all this, and it’s been a pleasure to join you for a ride, waking up at absurd hours (i live in america and sometimes the stream times are a bit wacky) just to watch yours, tubbo’s and many others. it has been quite the rollercoaster of… everything. thanks for so many happy memories, and i wish you the best.
Such a shame Technoblade was not here to witness this ;(
So close
Bro When tommy visited Techno's house, I cried so much.. I remember when I first got Into the server I was having really bad times and school and home, and I would watch the streams on my laptop. At some times, I got bullied so much at my school I wanted to kill my self. But the dsmp and the community made me feel like I had something to live for.  I miss coming home before my Grandma got off work just to watch the streams. Something I definitely will miss is all the memories that came along with it, too. (Sorry for the long ass paragraph lol my depressed inner monster came out lol 😅)
13:00 OH SHIT
omg i didnt cried this time, YASS
We’ll miss Dream SMP.
Still can't believe this is the final stream on the DSMP. So many memories, like dang. I'm actually crying.
Fun fact: I watched this stream on my way to therapy   (And did I tell her about it? Yes I did, we also watched the end of it together LMAOOO)
How come the dream smp is stopping
literally brought so much tears, thanks for a great 3 years of my life
You can’t just make me cry after work.
o7, S. I'd call it the "Dream SMP," but Dream is banned and it's no longer multiplayer, so it's really just S now
The Dream SMP has always had a separate place in my heart and its kinda sad to see it go. Thank you to all the content creators that were on the Dream SMP and I will never forget the amazing journey. ❤❤
Indonesian people gonna said something like this "yanggg benerrr?? 🤨🤨🧐", for real with no cap
o7
I feel like A part of my childhood just died
you finding a cat disc in techno's house was absolutely chilling. whether it's the real disc or not, it was like he was comforting you through letting go of the server. o7
great ending❤o7
o7
SALUTEE
I watched the vod lol
It's sad to see them beating the ender dragon without Technoblade but I'm sure he would be happy.
finally bru 💀
Bye Dream SMP.
@tommyInnit why is it the last
I never thought that visiting Technoblades cabin and sitting at the bench would bring tears to my eyes. Thank you for all the memories and laughter all of you have brought up over the last two years!
Omg thank you so much Tommy for all of the DSMP videos, this video actually made me cry lol.
Sad to see a big thing in my childhood end😔😟😢😭
I tried so hard not to cry and I still did. Dsmp was my life and you guys bring me so much joy I’m so sad to see this ending I was so hoping for season 2 and I’m gonna keep watching you guys but Dsmp will forever live on in my memories. Thank you for all the days when you cheered me up when I was sad Tommy your my comfort streamer and I really appreciate you, even if you don’t see this. Thank you
I wasn’t ready for this, the dsmp helped me through Covid and the last three years😢
Are you going to still keep uploading?
Truly the end of an era
this was emotional roller coaster thank you tommy and the smp  thank you for going to technos house one last time TECHO NEVER DIES!
Thank you tommy for the dream smp content. I will be forever grateful for the years of happiness the dream smp brought with you in it.
Nooooooooooooooo please dont
It's just make me feel sad😢
made me cry /gen
Did anyone notice that at 2:45 it just says "bottom text"
i remember a very long time ago, i used to comment on every one of my youtuber's videos. i stopped doing that for years... i dont remember the last time i actually commented on anything. (maybe thats bcuz of my bad memory tho? idk.)   i remember seeing this random dude trend on twitter. i had no idea who this kid was. i saw this specific screenshot of this guy's pov, getting aimed at by Dream and George. which was kind of weird to me because ive been watching those guys for a good maybe 9 months before i saw this? and i didnt know this kid. then i found out it was because they were on the server. the server i had no interest in watching for some reason? even tho it was with some of my favorite guys! but nope, i just didnt wanna watch it. but this kid... this kid. this kid caught my eye and i went to watch this random person i didnt even know on the server. The Dream SMP. i dont know what it was about this guy that made me so attached... maybe it was because i saw myself in him? the hyper, clingy, annoying friend. always going around causing trouble because its fucking funny.   well that dude was Tommyinnit.   i started to watch the videos he'd post of the Dream SMP. then i realized i needed more so i started watching the VODs. then i wanted to be there in real time so i started catching streams! he became the first and only person i actually watched live. at first the stuff was entertaining but then once i realized there was lore, ugh, there was no turning back for me. i mightve not been there from the very start but my love for these people and their characters, the lore and especially L'manburg, GREW. I might not have been able to see L'manburg start from nothing to something but i still felt apart of something.   i mostly watched Tommy's pov but i eventually started to watch other pov's that wouldve contributed to Tommy's storyline. i wish i couldve known everything with EVERYONES stories but i cant change that now. doesnt mean i didnt appreciate everyone else i was introduced to, tho. some of which i never heard before, familiar faces, and some that i did know existed but never paid anything attention to. ive gotten to witness great people and see them grow and succeed!  i remember the Exile Arc being the hardest part for me. but never did i stop watching. it was at that point when i realized how big of a c!Tommy kinnie i am. im so glad i got to experience that first hand. (my comfort video is still the one where Mexican Dream came to visit Logstedshire!)   then, even better, after all of that, Tommy going to Techno's house? HA, it was the best thing ever! ive gotten to finally know Techno and his character. (doesnt help that i also realized i kin c!Techno as well...) Their dynamic is hands down my favorite. its definitely my favorite point of time during this whole thing... it was just so funny and wholesome with still a little bit of angst mixed in, ya know? im so fucking grateful i was able to experience that with them both and the fans before Techno's passing. seeing his house definitely made me cry like im sure most of yall did haha.   my comfort character was/is Ghostbur. because, cmon, of course! i didnt know c!Wilbur... when i joined, thats when he blew the nation up and c!Philza killed him. i didnt have any connection to him like most of you probably had. (i didnt go back and watch videos i missed because i feel like it was like, dramatic and cool to not know some stuff. as in like i just moved into town or something lmao) so all i knew was Ghostbur. so you could imagine my anger at his death and c!Wilbur reappearing. totalllllyyy lame.   im just so grateful i got to experience this all. even tho i had no friends that watched it... i had THEM. i wasnt alone. thank you so much, Tommy... for showing me the way. without you, i dont know when or if i wouldve ever gotten into the Dream SMP! im sorry to Dream, George and Sapnap that i ignored your server and only joined for the hyper kid LOL. but honestly, i wouldnt change a thing. it was all... perfect. it made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me angry and theorize and going crazy!!!! but i love that shit.   honestly without this, who knows how long it wouldve took me to find out my identity? i cosplayed for a while there and one time in a Wilbur cosplay and i saw myself and i knew then that i was actually a boy.   my life would be very different without you, your friends and this server, Tommy. just like how you say sometimes in your videos that we might find you annoying?   well, i never found you annoying.
Thank you so much for creating all that content during the height of the pandemic, it really helped a lot of people get through isolation. Watching damp was a big part of my life and I’ll forever be great full to all the content creators who took the time to create amazing storylines, lore streams and funny videos. ❤ o7
Thanks for everything, big man❤
This is one of the best video I have ever watched
o7 we miss you techno
And to think I wouldn't cry over block game
I'm really gonna miss this, but I get why it's gotta go. It was a big part of my and many other's lives, but we've all grown up at least a little bit, and the creators have moved on! I'm never gonna forget all the fun memories we made, and I can't wait to make more with this community!
o7
Why are you making videos on the pdf server
Hey everybody, could you make this the most liked comment? I want to know that I had the most liked comment on the final dsmp tommy video. :)
RIP……TECHNOBLADE
No please don’t do it technos house please
It was Majestic an Beautiful in its own way, unique to the people who cherished the memories with their friends while recording their funny moments. im 14 now and started watching when i was 12, i spent alot of my time watching twitch streams over covid, And i think they really did help me if i was in a bad mood anyday of the week i would see techno or tommy post and i would get so excited. They're perspectives on things really shaped my mindset on who i wanna be in life. Im so glad that it happend i myself will always cherish the dream smp and the people who took place in it <3.
omg fuck Tommy you made me cry about Techno again. But fr this video was great! long live the dsmp!!!
I’m so thankful for everything the dreamSMP community has done for me, they helped me find my truest self in times of need and I’m so grateful. Words can never explain how much I owe everything to this server and everyone on it, I hope that only good comes from this and everyone does good in life. Thank you so much it has been a glorious ride. -H <3 ❤
O7. I still tier up
bro i watched like 5 episodes and im still sad lmao
Techno would have made a really good joke about it being the finale on the server
I'm gonna miss the Dream SMP :(
o7 dsmp. I don’t know where I would be right now without this server. Don’t be sad it’s over, be glad it happened.
o7

This was the whole last 2 yrs and a half of my life that helped me get through school… I am so grateful for the smp and especially u tommy. I am devastated that those times ended but everything doesn’t last forever right? 😢
Its sad but it was noce while it lasted. 😢
I can’t believe this sever would end and when you visit technoblade house it made me crying technoblade never dies! It’s been years now it end
Yay im early, still love this tho
I missed the stream I was so sad
I wow I am just happy but sad at the same time I feel like so many things happen in this server and I always wanted to be apart of it but I guess I was late I didn't have a chance as I just hope one day something like this can happen but with me this server will always be in my mind everything comes to a end eventually but thank you for every person who was part of the dream smp it was great watching all the whole entire story of this thank you so much.
It’s gonna be sad not to see him streaming on twitch anymore but at least we can still watch him on YouTube
I’m sad technoblade couldn’t be in the picture but I’m happy he’s here looking over our shoulders. ❤
I never really watched the Dream SMP, until a few months ago. I watched some of the POV's, and really loved it. I almost cried several times during this, because after watching some of Techno, Tommy, Dream, and other members videos, I loved the lore and the good times. It brought a smile to my face. This was an amazing journey, and lets hope there are more to come. Goodbye, Dream SMP...
Sad and happy.
Good job Tommy you actualy made me shed a tear in all these years thank you.
Dragon never die 😎
IT WILL NEVER BE THE SAMEEEEEE :(((((((((((((((((99

thank god its over
Legend never die 😎

Idk man i dont know what to say its amazing how much dream smp content there was and even when I didn't watch all of it, it still brought a smile to my eyes to see all of this stuff happen. thanks for all the laughs that you gave us, and thanks for letting us share this experience with you.
Dream smp will never be forgotten
Noooooooooooooo Rip dream smp
“i was here before the last dsmp stream”
Rip o7 Dsmp alot of memories Techno, All The War, The Great battle and YouTube most entertaining lore ever (Nihachu, Tommy, Tubbo, Dream, Techno, Phil, Jack, HBomb, Quackity😢) These memories will be missed forgotten not forgotten
Tommy: "I never cried on stream" Also Tommy: 12:36
Thank you, for making this content, story' line, jokes, memory, friends this mcserver Will be missed.  "It was never meant to be" -Eret "Don't you see what's happening here" "Don't you see that history repeating itself?" -Technoblade👑 "Legacy is all you leave behind" -Slimecicle  o7
Visiting Techno's home...that got me man
Bro, the sadness we all got when Tommy went to Techno's house.. 😢
TommyInnit is canonically the main character
tommy finnaly has his father again
Is there a season 2?
I watched that two-hour video for you to just shorten it 😐😑😐
Wow Can’t believe it’s almost been 3 years. Man what a journey it was. Being there since October 2020 was a blast. Thank you Tommy and all the other creators! o7   Rest well king 👑
thank you
I cried for 2 hours when he visited technos house
dsmp
L dream smp
Cool
NOOOOOO!
I’ve already watched this vod so many times. Thank you Tommy. This was all I could of asked for from this whole thing
Intro is So cute legend😢😂
Wait, is he quitting? I’m kinda confused
Dream SMP hella mid 🥱
It was fun while it lasted
It's been an amazing 2 years! I loved being a part of the chat during those years was a great experience and it's given me a lot of inspiration to do things I didn't think I could. I wanna thank you, Tommy. I can't even begin to express how much your streams and videos have changed me. I always feel welcome in your chat and you always find a way to make everyone laugh. It's truly been an amazing journey, bossman. I hope to be a part of more streams in the future!
Well I hope you still meet up with tubbo and still make video's don't stop making video's because you have millions of subs don't give up until the end.
When one story closed another story open
For techno
I almost cried at this😢
this was amazing, the dsmp was amazing, the call backs, the memories. It's another thing we'll be leaving behind in our memories to look back on when we're older and think "those where some nice times." Because they where, for both streamers and spectators. The dsmp is a time ending, but will be a legacy never forgotten, especially to those who where there to witness it. there may even be people who find the vods and see what was. The dsmp will forever hold a spot in my heart, right there next to Technoblade. He had a good run, and I'm glad I was there to witness it. Farewell DSMP, rest in peace Technoblade, o7 boys, o7.❤
Goodbye Dream SMP, it’s been fun.
o7 dsmp.
End of a era
Connection terminated. I'm sorry to interrupt you Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name. But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume. Although you have indeed been called. You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach. But you will never find them, none of you will. This is where your story ends. And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you. Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well, I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors: Be still and give up your spirits, they don't belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend. My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you. I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. It's time to rest. For you, and for those you have carried in your arms. This ends for all of us. End communication.
Watching the stream was good but this was definitely better with the edits, thank you for all the memories.
the last time listen music with Tuboo looks like Tommyinnit’s girlfriend
oh god my heart its too wholesome
It was a great journey your a great YouTuber tommy
im gonna kms if you dont come back do you want to be responsible for mi death
o7
FLIIIIIIIIIIP YEAH TUBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Where one journey ends, another begins. There will be something just like Dream SMP for us all to have fantastic memories on, it won't be the same as nothing could replace these days. But we have many good days head of us, ladies gentlemen and those in between, let's press on to the future together.
o7, thank you for everything <3

Rip dsmp I’ll miss you
11:12 brought back memories, techno never dies O7
Why are they gonna stop making content in the dream SMP
Literally cried. Throughout the whole thing missed the times when we saw technos base
Dream has techno's crown now..
What a fitting and beautiful end o7
Dsmp got me through the toughest days of my life and I'm so greatful to everyone who was a part of it
O7
:)
the end of an era
"I'm sorry for the thing that I did to your house" "What things." "Oh never mind then :D"
I wish technoblade live forever😢
how to make a man cryyy
what an amazing acomplishment this server is .there is soo much that i want to say but im gonna just say that this. this server is one that i will never forget and this video ended it perfectly with technos house visit and the last minute of the video making me feel such strong emotions that i haven't felt in a long time.  well done tommy.  well done dream SMP.  PS:TECHO NEVER DIES! ❤❤
“i know what your thinking tommy has a lot of trauma with tnt and buttons but thats c tommy i am tom tommy” as a c! tommy irl i can confirm i have lots of trauma with tnt and buttons
it was nice while it lasted right?
The DreamSMP saved me. Seeing it having to end is so disappointing. But it's probably for the best. Thank you all.  Also seeing Tommyinnit go to Techno's for one last time brought tears to eyes. Rest in peace Technoblade. I could not thank everyone enough.
finally
wait why is this the last time?
"My keyboard broke up with me"
what is number 2 on 0:21
I can’t believe it’s over.  I really enjoyed the chaos between everyone and the storyline aswell and once the video enddd it really set in that it’s all done. I’ll never forget the Dream SMP
11:57 I can hear techno screaming from the afterlife 🥲🥲🥲
I haven't been really active ever sense dream was out in prison then after that I saw everyone reaction to techno's death. I honestly was so glad I was able to experience this. I remember the night my older brother showed me Tommy's 1st video on the dsmp. I'm so glad I saw everyone having so much fun and I'm glad I met techno before he passed. He will always remain the #1 potato farmer in our hearts. Technoblade never dies! ❤️
Techno would be proud
i cryed when he went to technos house and when he rung the belll waaaaaa
Damn man i feel like crying when you visited the legend house. Technoblade Never Dies!
No way he used the sleep deprived song for whooping the ender dragon 💀 once a schlatt fan always a schlatt fan
I am literally crying. Long Live Technoblade ❤️
Thanks for all the memories O7
Thanks man. The dream smp is cool as fuck throughout covid
This was the best ever all of us remembering when he first joined the server then all the way to the end while doing lots of things on the way
I am so incredibly glad I was here for this stream. I’ve been watching the Dream SMP for about 1 1/2 years now and it’s been an amazing experience. I’ve found my favorite content creators and had some of my favorite moments when life was tough while watching this server, and I honestly don’t know where I would be without it. I give a special shoutout to you Tommy, Ranboo, Wilbur, Techno, Tubbo, and Slimecicle for becoming people that I’ve looked up to and have provided me a sense of community and belonging. I do admit, this stream was really hard to watch and I cried A LOT and it was really hard to see the server go… but don’t cry because it’s over. Smile because it happened.
This is a cinematic masterpiece, I am currently cosplaying as a waterfall
2:45 *"BOTTOM TEXT"*
Is anyone gonna mention the fact that Tommy was actually calling Bad, Big Jesus💀
Finally that god forsaken server is gone.
Y'all should have never stopped uploading Dream SMP videos.
O7
The visit to technos House literally made me cry and the flash back at the end was awsome the smp has been my life for the past few years and i just want to say it's been great and Technoblade never dies!! 😭😭😭
Why aren't u verified on Twitter?
o7
it feels so unreal. such a big part of my life just.. gone. like a fever... dream.
Thank God it's finally over
o7
I'm going to miss the dsmp, it brought me such good times! I bonded with friends, got hate, and made new friends! Truely surpasses any other life experience I have ever had. It was way better that when my entire school found out about my furry mask! But really, this has been awesome. You helped me through so many hardships and made me smile through the toughest times. I am so happy that this smp happened. Thank you so much. ily! <33
Technoblade never dies but the DreamSMP does 👍👍👍
Now im hoping we get a second series, a new beginning. That would be awesome
😢
That imagine of Tubbo and Tommy just sitting there watching the sunset, with Cat in the background is perfect
Este video 😿😿😿
Bitch boy is a bitch                     -Tommy 2020
It is just so sad and heartwarming that Tommy just had to visit Techno's house. o7
so much nostalgia from 2020 in this video
Damn
Thanks for the dream smp videos:D I almost cried watching this
Is it just me or am I sobbing my eyes out 😭😭😭😭that was so amazing !bravo!
lets go
I was here during the stream I cried alot but o7s
Thank you for everything.  Thank you for all the memories. It was more than a pleasure being part of this and i’d do it all again. Goodbye Dream SMP. o7

o7
o7
rip dream smp it will live on forever
I think I speak for everyone when I say This is a very bitter-sweet moment. Even though it’s heartbreaking knowing this is it, I think that’s a good thing. The Dream SMP played a role in our of our lives, rather it be minor or major. Seeing Techno’s house after so long made me cry, but not of sadness, but out of greatness. Thank you Tommy, Dream, Tubbo, Techno, and everyone else on the server for giving so many people something to look forward to ❤
Farewell Dream SMP o7
Noooooooooooo!😊
Rip😢😭😢😭😫😢😭😢😫🥺😭

waht happind it used to be such a good fun server
Man I did NOT think I would get upset watching this video. Love ya Tom and watching you grow o7
The visit to techno's house literally made me ball my eyes out. Techno meant so much to me and others. The fact that techno wasn't there for the last streeam also made me cry. o7:(
when will the map be downloadable?
It's insane how far the SMP has come. Just two years and it's built such a fan base. It's a shame to see it go, but the memories of it are what count. I just want to thank Tommy and everyone else for the memories. I can't explain how much I'll miss the SMP, but at least it brought us all together in a way.❤ How bittersweet.
I got emotional during the techno visit. It was the “thats what he would have wanted” line that really got me
Thank you for everything
Nooo😢😢😢
10:52 why delete the SMP then?
So you won't make any more content? 😢
I’m literally crying rn
what a good finale for the Dream SMP, truly one of an kind to have watched over the years, techno never dies ❤
Even though I was watching the stream and cried then I still cried like 10 times just rewatching it, I’m not ready to accept Technos death
o7
O7
wait sorry I’m commenting this b4 finishing the video but isn’t there a season 2?

Holy shit this video makes my heart feel so happy To see how far all of them have come since their first day is wonderful, i almost cried omg, The Dream Smp was my life for so long and it was my therapy, its one of the reasons im still alive today, This server means so much to me and millions of other people, this video makes me feel so many emotions all at the same time, the dsmp will forever be in my heart <333
I wonder if we're ever getting a public world download, the fanmade recreations are great but I'd love to explore a real copy
man...
you can see him holding back tears going through techno's house. Poor kid
This was so sad
wow just wow
2023 is the year of finales and tears.
I'll miss this. This server is a big part of my memories in the quarantine. It was one of the things that kept me sane. Glad to see all of you just being friends and having fun.  RIP Techno, Rest in Power, Rest in Peace.     Thanks for everything. Thank you for all the people who made the Dream SMP who worked so hard to make this beautiful, one of a kind story. Techno, Wilbur, Dream, Tommy, Tubbo, and everyone, all of you. Thank you.      See you guys on your next grand endeavors, which will surpass even the Dream SMP. I think we'll all know why.       You legends will never die. o7
This is fuckin sick wtf
Rip dream SMP ❤
The fact they have an official site for technoblade's merch, god I'm gonna cry again, technoblade never dies. this whole video is really emotional, I never thought the story of the dsmp would end but here we are, I will miss the story as will a lot of others
Am this is how boys became men😢
i cried fr.
So long dream smp
This was such an amazing video. The last scene where everything flashes before our eyes was incredible. Ty for also visiting Technos place. The End fight was so cool too.  Technoblade Never Dies.
11:50 When Tommy looked at what Techno had in his inventory last🥲
I loved seeing this live, and my childhood will forever be graced.
We all gotta quit sometime, it's OK though. The memories this server gave us were great, the whole server teaming up to build this was what made the dream smp great. RIP Dream SMP.
After 2 years we FINALLY know what’s in how to sex!!!!!
So surreal
Ig it realy was the triplet towers
Deaaaam
W video
Thanks tommy and everyone on the dream smp, the last few years have been amazing to be able to watch you guys everyday ❤️❤️❤️❤️
didn't expect to cry watching a tommyinnit vid but when he went to technos house kinda got me :(
this brought an influx of sentimentality, especially the visit to Techno's house.
<3
Crazy how fast this era passed by
Technoblade never dies.
i genuinely had to sit with my tears and cry. this stupid server meant too much for words to me, and i adored every minuteof stupid plotlines to the point i nearly failed my mocks lmao. thank you, tommy, thank you
Even though I joined this community really late, I'm so glad I found it. It was such a wild ride watching all the youtube videos and stream vods. Thanks for everything Dream SMP
14:11 the slow creaking of his chair fucking killed me lmao
I berst into crying when saw the techno,s house 11:30 but IDK why I feeld so good
My favorite memory is when techno blew up l'manberg, technically dream blew it but technoblade did the amazing fight scene, animators didn't even animated the "it end's today"
Rest in peace Dream SMP, the server may be gone but we’ll always have the memories
i forget how beautiful the sever is omg :(( it was great and funny also emotional ngl !!
Everyday I tell myself I'll be able to move on and not cry about techno, and every time I see his face I'm proven wrong
o7
o7
The best ending anyone could ever ask for. Thank you so much for everything. o7
thank you for everything dream smp
It was fun watching your videos in the DreamSMP
o7 to the blade
I'm 14, so one seventh of my life was spent engrossed in this series during quarantine, when the Dream SMP was all that was keeping me alive and going in life. Thank you so much for everything you've done for us, you and the entire Dream SMP have had such a profound impact on so many people. It feels like revisiting a place I used to live in, and remembering every memory that happened in every place. RIP Dream SMP, you will be forever remembered and forever missed, and onto new projects and adventures!!
GGS!!! DREAM SMP!!!
My un-canon lore ending: techno decided that he really doesn't own anything to dream or anyone and anorchism wasn't the true way and in that chest that dream left for him was a map to the stronghold with the letter saying : "its all jeans fault.....  as my favor, please end my suffering, she is behind my aggressive behavior and ranboo's split personality please KILL her!" implying that the dragon was behind all of it, kidnapping and keeping everyone in the Dream SMP and consuming them by abusing their emotions, this explains how Wilbur was able to free himself from the SMP by accepting that he can infact scape and emotions is the way to go, then techno calls up all the server and uses the only usable books to become a god himself and helping everyone kill the dragon and leave the server to their own worlds and timelines!   (There are some more details but I did not really watch the SMP that much )
Chommy innit
"Just killed a gogy, feeling good!" - Tommyinnit 2023 And now this is my favorite quote
Man I wish techno was there to help fight the dragon. He'd help kill the dragon then he'd just jump everyone. TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!
Aww I can’t believe it’s over already! I remember when it just started and I was in covid and I came across the dreamSMP and found all my favourite YouTubers that I still watch till this day  Thanks for all the great memories 💜💜
hope sadist animates this
Can you please post a download link I really want to just visit and explore the Dream SMP.
Legit cried seeing Techno's house

We’ll miss this arc and few years of our lives. Some of the best years of my entire life, I’m glad my middle school years were spent with you guys.
So many memories, so many stories. the dsmp has always been one of my favorite things to happen in mc. It exposed me to ranboo and Wilbur. I will deeply miss the dsmp. Especially since I doubt anything similar will ever come because of how fast the internet moves on from ideas. I'll see you all in 10-20 years when this is deemed "retro" by children.
Season 2!? Clif hanger
When tommy killed the bee
goodbye, dream smp. these past 2 years have been great :)
This has been a journey.
1:46 Tommy that's not true. There's always the Jack MANIFOLD- ER.... UH... UM I mean the bottom of the barrel.
RIP TECHNOBLADE
Ok but like heres a recipe for meth:     Why tf do you want to know the recipe.
Thank you DSMP for all the memories and laughs o7  Technoblade never dies :)
those who love us never truly leave us.
fucking christ..I have seen some of dream smp but i wish there was more..maybe one day..
I've seen this stream, it was funny, emotional (due to technoblade and last moment) and hype Well goodbye
what a journey
4:43 best firework show EVER!!
huuummmmmmmmmmma
That final flicker through the DSMP timeline before disconnecting was wonderful. There should be a compilation of screenies that you've taken throughout the nearly 2 1/2 years... Thank you Dream SMP,  for raising us through one of the worst times in the world. We are amazingly grateful.
Noo
You should beg Grain to join his next Life series.
This brought a whole bunch of memories back and I died of laughter at work. And I felt some big sads but also happy sads
Crying
Just seeing technos base one last time started tears thankyou tommy. Technoblade never dies
I’m so glad I’ve been able to watch your Dream SMP journey from the very first episode. Incredible stuff, Tommy!
Techno..we gonna miss you and i cry when I hear your name...
😢bye dream smp 😕
😢
9:40 glarses keyboard?
Thank you so much for being such a staple in my, and many others’, life. Watching these streams saved me in more ways than one, and for that I thank you again.

This brought tears but made my day
Good
Enough to make a grown man cry.  But really all of the memories, tommy joining the smp, lemanbrug, the drug van,  and the bad things like Technoblade’s death, but that’s what made it fun every day I would watch the stream  never knowing what I’m going to see the end of this SMP will forever be remembered I mean, this will be on  for gettable again all of the memories, Quackity, The fox man (fundy) Sam, so much members. This is truly just sad, and RIP ❤️🫡 o7 to the legend.
I cried man💔
This vid was a roller coaster of emotions. Reliving all the memories was so nice but made me kinda sad to see that what got me through Covid, and quarantine, is done. I hope one day you will log back in. I know it’s the last dsmp but there could be a last last time. But, they’re are bigger things out there for you tommy, and thank you for making 2020-2021 quarantine a little more bearable🫶🏼.
Techno's house will remain as his last build..
i cried lol
One last o7
Thank you, DreamSMP, for all of the memories you helped us form in our hardest times, during one of the hardest periods of the twenty first century. o/ TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!!  ❤❤
Tommy: "I've never cried on stream" 12:36 *Cries along with everyone.
My passion for the dsmp died the day Techno did, but I wanted to get some closure so I skipped a bit through this video, seeing Technos home again, the place he spent so much time with us, with you guys, with all of us. I really miss him every day, this might be the goodbye to the dsmp, but for me its a goodbye to all those great memories, they stay in my heart, but in the end they are the last we have of him. I really thank all of you for making this possible, for making his last years on here so great. o7
17:22 this should be on a music stream

So sadd😢😢
"I don't remeber the spawn being so GAY!"  THAT MADE ME CRACK 💀
10/10 Most amazing way I've seen a server shutting down for the last time
Damn it's ending after almost three years, huh? Right after Limited Life ended too
oh man that was fucking sick o7
What happened to How to Sex 2?
Where is wilbur soot?
then tommy banned everyone including himself
End or era, On to the next chapter. It was amazing 3 years we had. Thankful for all of the wonderful/saddest memories this sever brought.
fuck..
I’m gonna miss dsmp, it all started two years ago when my brother said “you ever heard of the dream smp? they have dream in it!” and i’m just so darn nostaglic.
o7
Finally
Dream doesnt sound like Dream 😂😭

My favorite memories in the SMP is you and TECHNO. I MISS TECHNO 🥲
The final sunset goes deep so deep u wanna cry only real men will cry at this
Thanks Tommy brings all this
There’s really nothing else to say but o7
Y'all, I'm crying. Thanks for all the memories!
I'm gonna miss the Dream SMP so much. I'm sad that techno wasn't there to see it though. (No, I'm not copying another comment. One account is my gacha account and this  one is my animation account.)
i was here. o7
I'm gonna miss the Dream SMP so much. I'm sad that techno wasn't there to see it though.
I don’t want to be the person but Techno carried the DSMP like my dad carried the milk
This fucking server was my childhood. I just hope that in the future these guys will make more
An end of an era, and the beginning of the rest of your lives
❤
jesus… it’s so weird that it’s over. i remember how many times i just felt so alone and isolating during COVID, and how this community literally made me the person i am today and SAVED me. i could never express how grateful i am to the entirety of this server and this community and especially Tommy. thanks for the best years of my life ❤
technos house...
It’s fine Tommy shroud left me and never came back your lucky you trapped him.
I don’t think I can say this enough, but… Thank You DSMP, u have all been a big part of my life and my #1 inspiration for starting yt, u brought us laughs and smiles when we needed it most. U have always been there for us, now we’ll do the same :]  And for this end of an amazing chapter, from the words of an unforgettable legend: “…so long Theseus!” <3
"An smp is not dead if they're buried, they're dead if forgotten."  -SMPEarth, SMPLive, and lastly, DSMP.   The SMP will never be forgotten because of the memories made on it, but like tubbo said, everything has to come to an end eventually, it ended like how dream and george said it would on the first stream,   G: "Will we kill the ender dragon? "  D: "Soon I guess"  Goodbye DSMP, thank you for giving me one of the best 3 years of my life, the best memories, and lastly, giving me comfort and making me feel safe,I will never forget you, as an honour, Goodbye DSMP. ❤
i used to watch DSMP 3 years ago but this still made me watch, goodbye DSMP
Visiting Technos house made me cry and feel grief I hadn’t felt since the news got out. Rest In Peace Techno <3
this server is what made me the happiest in my worst years. and even if i only ever caught 1 stream (Techno's pov on doomsday), all of this will always be on my heart. I may be lost on parts of the lore, I may have not seen every bit of it in the very start, but I will always be grateful for all things each of the amazing content creators helped me go through.   this server was something very special from many points of view,  it helped people, it gave us music and art from fan service, it revived the game, it's entertainment, it's a story, it's a whole world. but most importantly, it's a journey.  thank you, Techno, Tommy, Phil, Wilbur, Ranboo, Quackity, Tubbo, Fundy, Schlatt, everyone  just, thank you, for everything ❤
end of an era. thank you dsmp
This has been a part of my life honestly, it's so sad that it's over, then again, all good things come to an end eventually- thanks for this, I'm just a random stranger and I doubt this will be noticed by anyone but it was amazing while it lasted ❤
It’s been good when it lasted
lol
this is so bittersweet man, tysm for this tommy <3
No more tommyinit videos at all
Just a sad momment tbh I doubt anyone will read this comment Oh well ❤
Never gonna forget dsmp
Pogchamp, brothers, pogchamp o7
Going through with all of this…was the most emotional thing that could ever happen to me, cause for my people who were first time watchers of this very smp would know what it feels like to go through with this…goodbye dream smp
I know it wasn't part of the lore but, the part where he looks at the main chest in techno's house. I like to think that Technoblade probably put that in the main chest from the afterlife.
this was the best
The end of an era  Here’s to new beginnings 🥂
Finally the end to an awful fanbase
This was so good but so sad😢
17:45, nooooooooooooooooooooo, this is so sad

As a final message, I just want to say. pogchamps.
the sell-out bell ring and shouting out techno's merch, he would have loved that
Why is it ending? I haven’t been following along with anything, someone please tell! Sorry:(
Man, I'll never forget this server. I've followed your adventures here from the very beginning. I'll miss it. And most of all I'll miss techno, the man who carried it on his shoulders while battling cancer. Technoblade never dies👑🐷🗡🏹 I wonder what the animated series will be like, but your role is done. Thanks for everything ❤
At 2:52 tommyinnit was killed by tubbo after betraying his pact with bees
So.. this is the last tommyinnit video?
When Tommy went inside Technos house, I bawled my eyes out like a nerd
This server was how I discovered tommy, and it started one of the most innovative, creative, entertaining, and funny series of videos from everyone on the server that I’ve ever seen. Truly a feat of greatness. The best SMP to ever exist.
voy a extrañar mucho el dream smp
2:45 bottom text
finally over god damn 😂
Who here sad
“bottom text” 2:45
I’m actually sad
Not me actually crying
i'm glad this ended when it did, but a part of me will always be disappointed. it was great while it lasted, here's to moving on!
This was honestly beautiful and brought me to tears, from visiting technoblades base to killing the ender dragon everything was great, the memories everyone had will forever live on in the back of our minds, thank you for making everyone's life better Tommy, rest in peace technoblade and the dream SMP
😢
hopefully there will be a new chapter
I almost cried even though I wasn’t there to see all of them,I understand the accomplishment and the emotions and flashbacks.congrats Tom.hope we see you rise one day for that hypixel title
honestly, i may not be in this fandom anymore, but im glad i was. dsmp made me so fucking happy during covid, and im sad to see it end. i miss technoblade, i miss when i used to log on after school and watch the newest streams. but, the memories i had with you guys and many others were fantastic. you fixed me, basically, or well my mental state,  you may have not been my favourite on the dsmp tom, but your such an amazing person i wish you the best of luck. o7. im happy i was able to share this with you guys.
thank you tommy, and everyone else on this server. i think we can all agree that the Dsmp journey has been amazing <3
Thank you everyone on the dream smp for saving my life. 2020 was a very dark time for me and I had one thing in the world keeping me afloat and it was dream smp.   So I give my thanks to Dream George Sapnap Tubbo Ranboo Wilbur Philza Technoblade Quackity Niki Foolish Fundy Eret  Sadist Drista  And everyone in the dsmp fandom. I love all of you and I’ll never forget these past 3 years. They were the best years of my life.  ❤❤❤

Anyone know the music used when Tommy visits technos house ?
I’m gonna miss this. All the lore and the pure joy that you guys bring. Here’s to the best for 2023 and beyond!
I loved this server, and I think I speak for everyone, when I say that we did not want this to end, but alas we could not avoid it, everyone knew it was coming. This server has never failed to make me laugh, and thank you for all the memories. Technoblade never dies.
One word for all of this. Gg
o7
I usually dont comment on yt vids but this one is way too special to just not say anything...  even that i wasnt here at day 1 i loved every second of the dsmp, so many emotions, so many youtubers/streamers that i discovered and loved, so many awesome people, the places that i imagined, the headcanons, the fandom, everithing was awesome  its sad that it ended but every good thing must come to a end eventually, right?  and theres so many others cool stuff that will happen, like the QSMP and the USMP!! im so glad that i can say that...  I WAS HERE!!!! <3
End of an era, I guess.
There is still one person missing that makes it even sadder
This video made me cry
i kid you not, i actually cried when you went through techno's house, the memories and the knowledge that that's all we have just hit me. thank YOU for giving us these memories <3
Dreamsmp was the only thing that got me through online school :)) <3 I’ll miss it
hi
As the sun sets apon these ancient lands, the once adventurous players move on for greater treasures and greater tales. This journey, this memory of a land once thriving with rivalry and vengence, a land of peace and betreyal, had finaly ended.
I guess this is the end of an era! Thanks for everything to the whole of the Dream SMP. Nice Work!
Im crying I miss technoblade his died
dream smp was mid
WHAT A ROLLERCOASTER OF EMOTIONS!!! This sever was my obsession for two years and wow. Thank you all for everything
I wish techno could make a joke out of everyone being sad from leaving this server...
I love how at the beginning tommy just keeps telling dream lies and dream just seems so tired and out of it to not even question nor care and it just like “yeah sure tommy” 🤣🤣
4:02 OH NO HE HAS OPENED THE PANDORA'S BOOK WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TOMMYINNIT  jokes aside this is such a bittersweet ending. the server became a place where cc's from different places could commune to have fun and make content together. it's been a fun and wild ride, and it's sad to see it end but at the same time I'm happy that you guys were able to give it a solid ending with a bang. Thank you, Tommy. Thank you, Dream. Thank you to all of the creators who made this server fun and enjoyable to watch. 💚💚
its finally happened damn i waited a while
sobbing rn. its likr 1am and im genuinely scared of waking up my family. the dsmp has saved me back in 2021-2022 and im so glad to have been a part of suvh a huge community. in the last few months ive been way more distant from the community and mcyt in general but i will never not be grateful for the huge impact this community had had on my personality, quirks, childhood and so on. ive met / gotten close to all of my closest and dearest friends beacuse of the dsmp and i will never nit be grateful for that. thank you for practicalky rasining me and turning mr into the person i sm now<3
What a journey this was.
Goodbye DREAM DMP you we will never ferget you
“…No matter how ridiculous the odds may seem, within us resides the power to overcome these challenges and achieve something beautiful. That one day, we'll look back at where we started and be amazed by how far we've come." - Technoblade
This means Tubbo was the Mc all along…
o7
Dream SMP for me was a number of actors on a stage with high-budget stage props. When things were bad, you guys tanked it and said ""The show must go on!"".Now, the show must come to an end. Thank you. And so he plays his part.
At Techno's house I think the disk was one of his goodbye messages to Tommy
The fact that tommy thought the merry Christmas book was for him even tho us started with “Dear Sam”
Thank you for this beautiful final and these wonderful memories! It was such an adventure and im glad i got to knew the dreams smp and its amazing memebers. We laughed cheered and cried togheter and i will miss the good times. I will never forget. Also thank you for showing us one last time the base of technoblade. i deeply miss him. So long dream smp o7
I litterally cried when you visited technos house. This was such an emotional video
This meant the world to me. The scene where it flipped through all the photos before hitting disconnect was epic. This video is very nostalgic somehow. Thank you.
I SWEAR FOR 3 YEARS GEORGE IS ALWAYS SLEEPING!!!
DSMP S2?!?!?!?
I knew this day would come but it actually happening is just, surreal almost? I spent the last almost 3 years of my life fixated onto this server and everyone in it, I met some of my closest friends through it, seen events, and made memories. I found a family and comfort through this server I’ve never found anywhere else. I can’t put into words the “Thank you” that I want to say, it’s too much, but I do want to say to everyone how grateful I am for everything this server brought to me and hundreds of millions of people, I love you, thank you. :,) <3
Rest in peace, The Dream SMP
Does this mean TommyInnit won’t be making anymore videos or the Dream SMP is just discontinued?
No I'm not crying you're crying!   Thanks for all the pogger streams guys

❤
Wait so ur quiting mc also???
This has really been a journey. I will cherish this memory for as long as I can. I will really miss it and these 2 years have probably been some of the greatest times of my life. Thank you for everything and everyone in the community.   “All good things must come to an end eventually” - Tubbo
14:50 it’s sad to know that that group picture was not completed since our beloved Technoblade could not be in it. 😢😢😢
Wait.. so you won't be posting anymore??
I just felt all the same feelings I felt watching everyone’s smp content up to this point and I am comforted by that. Thank you Tommy, and everyone for these past 2 years❤
Byoogers
why are my eyes wet
Bro this happened forever ago. (Tubbo uploaded this like, 2 weeks ago.)
Its time to take a road down MEMORYLANE 😥
No
Thank god it's over 🙏
Coming up on the anniversary of Technoblade's death (still a couple months, but closer than it was a month ago), it was so sad to see him going to Techno's house. Honestly, was already crying because of the smp being deleted, but was much more sad when he went to Techno's house. :(
Will always miss you Techno. o7’s for the king, and most importantly, gonna miss the DSMP streams.
Even from the dead techno gets to sell out and plug merch
When he went to technoblades cabin, tears were streaming down my face. The dsmp was always such a huge part of my life and got me through so much the last 2 years. This is the first video I’ve watched in a few months, and it’s crazy to just see the change in things. I have loved being in this community more than words could ever ever count. It’s a bittersweet moment, really.
YES YES YEEEEEESSSSS!!!!! FINALLY!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆😆😆
2 years I've known the dream smp. I was 12. I've grown up now, and that's terrifying. new beginnings are scary, but as long as you keep the memories present, you'll always still be that same person you were. thank you, dream smp. thank you, Tommy.
Thank you so much!
Nice bro
17:22 the fuck…
I am crying in real life because of techno’s house, may he rest in peace
It ended after 2 and a half years it ended now it's goin down history not only them had a good time we also did thank u dsmp goodbye
A beautiful last episode.
I’m not crying you ate
"All good things come to an end eventually"  NOOO, I want to go back to 2020  :(
Nooooooooooooooooooo😢
I wish there was something that could have made you and the others did not deleted it but... No😢. "I have climbed the highest mountains I have run through the fields only to be with you only to be with you," But I still haven't found what I'm looking for, but I still haven't found what I'm looking for" RIP THE DREAM SMP
I never noticed tom had a double chin
Technoblade will be forever known as one of, no, THE most inspiring YouTuber in YouTube history. His memory will live on for years to come. Everything that has happened on the SMP will be remembered with joy. Technoblade never dies!!!
DREAMSMP NEVER DIES
So many memories...
Finally 🎉🎉🎉🎉
they are gonna make another one.
Thank you for the memories, Dream SMP. You were a part of my life that I will never forget. You helped me make new lifelong friends and kept me going every single day. Tommy you and everyone else were the reason I was waking up every day during the height of the pandemic, so thank you, for everything. Techno will always be in our hearts, Technoblade never dies!!!!  o7
the end of an era. ❤ we didn’t know we were making memories, we were just having fun.
Good bye Dream SMP! Thank you for all the memories! o7 👑🐷🕊
crying rn gbye dsmp you all will always be in my heart
Tommy: part 3 is come out Saturday
nothing has made me this sad at 1am since endgame
The Dream SMP is weird, I haven’t really given a damn about it since Lmanberg got destroyed but this made me feel a bit melancholy due to the fact that it was still a great experience to sit through and be there for and I loved every second. Goodbye Dream SMP.
Why end it
Lol I love this video
Why are they ending it
finally!!!!! i hated this thing’s fanbase!!!!
i was there during the stream the whole thing
O
Thank you
So sad😢
Thanks for all the memories
Looking back, the pandemic felt like a long night, and the SMP felt like a Dream we had during that.   Goodbye Dream SMP.
😭😭😭😭
When you went to technos house I started crying
You are very much welcome tommy, I knew you could end with one last time...
fuck man watching this whole thing live was MENTAL and I'm actually like sad for it ending but I'mhappy that it was a part of my life man. I think I can speak for all of us if I say that this was A HUGE insperation for so many people :)) thank you for all the great memories king <3 o7
The saddest time in everyone's life 😭😭😭😢😢
it went from me crying to ITS MLG TIME
Goodbye to dsmp the server who get my smile back on and thanks for dsmp members for let everything bad happened out... This server won't forgetting in our hearts like techno...  "Don't be sad that is over, be happy that it's happen" Goodbye for the happiness ig techno and dsmp meet each other again!! Techno is so proud of you guys and us.. He proud of tubbo for killing the last blood of the ender dragon... I hope that techno was there but.. He has to leave  Rip technoblade 😭🕊 Rest in peace you both😭💔🕊 You won't forgetting in our hearts..  and I want to say something that I have wrote a song for dsmp and technoblade... But I don't want anyone read it because the grammar is not the best and the English is bad ofc 😭😅   Technoblade never dies💔🕊😭       o7
It's so sad
I’m going to miss this server
Bruh i did not want to cry today😢
who knew that Dream waking up to wanting to make a very simple small survival server would make a teenager into a millionaire
9:14 oh god here we go again.
o7 live your best life tommy  PS this is literally owl house rn like how it ended 😢
We all thought we dealt with Techno's death, turns out that we didn't.  Our grief doesn't get smaller it's us that grow around it. And whenever we remember it it hurts just as bad as the first time, but we're stronger now than what we were before.  I will always appreciate all the memories these people brought us during one of the hardest moments in our lives so far.  I didn't realize how much I still cared about it until I started crying
o7
Rip Technoblade

Tommy: "Ive never cried on camera" Literally tommys pfp:
Hey Tom? Thank you. I first came onto your stream when it was the first l’manburg war and I haven’t really left since. I mean, brother you raised me from some sad little 11 year old to me now, (Abeit 14 but I’m a big man now), and I can’t thank you enough. This kept me going, and it’s really sad to know it’s over, but I’m happy you enjoyed, and I know all of us did too. So thanks, man.
It's full of emotions
It was an honor to be there to watch it all. We will never forget this series
thank you for everything Tommy. We love you <3
ouch
the ''that's defenitelly what he would've wanted'' broke me dude, that's so techno TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
This is enough to make a German cry. 😔
I genuinely cried when he went to  technos house I still can’t believe it  the same time as good friend went aswell-  ❤ miss then both o7  Techno never dies!
im kind of sad now
o7
If the video wasn't enough to make me cry, then the comments certainly did. o7
RIP dream smp
even with it gone, i don’t think i’ll ever leave this fandom. the fandom is still so big, and i’m sure there will always be enough fan content to consume.
WOW. Tommyinnit, thank you for being part of my life along side the dream snap. Visiting all the places was just great, and visiting Techno’s house one last time was just heartbreaking. Thank you and RIP 🐷 👑
🤧 so long dream smp
Gg ez
It was one hella of a journey, and i’m glad it happened, and i’m thankful i was there. -Me
Very pOgGErs video, but fr rip to the server
Dream has been refusing to change anything on his skin for so long. But when techno got diagnosed, he added the ribbon. And now he honors his friend with the crown.
Im going to miss this server
17:25  (far away)   You two should kiss!
Man everything has changed and it's already been 2 and a half years since the Dream SMP started. It was really fun to watch all the great moments but now it comes to an end. Techno's house really brought good memories to remember, Technoblade never dies. Can someone tell me why I'm old
i cried twice watching this, im not in the fandom anymore but i will never forget the dsmp
I've been watching the dream SMP vods for years man, I've loved it so much and it was always the best thing during lock down, Great ending to a great series.
Him visiting technos base got my water works going. Techno blade never dies!
The end of something beautiful 🥹
👏👏👏
Who else cried?🗿
I'm crying over a block game. I've never felt happier.
i've been watching since 2020 and those dsmp streams got me thru covid so this was super emotional i wont lie. this was definitely the closure we all needed.
2 years to kill the dragon smh
Fly hi techno
It was a pleasure to watch you all this time. No regrets in watching and just being in this community o7 Technoblade never dies. 🐷👑
No I'm not crying!   Ohhh I can't help it. Wahhh😭😭😭

Its been a great 2 year for this SMP thank you for all the memories.
😢just wish techno was there it felt heartbreaking when seeing his house ❤  (Technoblade never dies 🎉❤)
Watching this I cried for the first time in months but I will miss this. And thank you Tommy for your annoying yet funny content.
💔
Oh wow, well this is so sad.
The fact that when u finish this a video of first ever episode on dsmp pops up
These 2 years have been amazing listening and watching to everyone’s streams, and I hope that you all still make content together. Tommy, and everyone else are my favourite streamers/you tubers and I can’t wait to see what’s next in store for everyone.
B I g s a d b o I 😢
The DSMP has and will be my favourite SMP but for 18 minutes… I forgot about everything in life and just went through a wave of memories… thank you Tommy and thank you all of the DSMP members for such a wonderful 3 years of pranks, friendships, betrayals and wars. Andy Bernard once said in the office finale: I wish there was a way to know you were in the good days, before they’ve ended… I never thought that would come true for me.  Technoblade never dies Long live L’manberg  and How to Sex? 🫡
Tommyinit smp next?🤨
I'm not crying, I'm just sweating from my eyes 🥹
Even good thing come to an end...😢,goodbye
May techno rest in peace
Technoblade Never Dies
This is too deep
Goodbye Dream SMP. Thank you for the roller coster of a journey. o7 ❤
10:58 who are we in the end? 07
Goodbye Dream SMP  o7
oh the tears
1 minute of silence for dream smp chat pls
The DSMP has helped me through so much and its sad to see it ending. It will be missed and im honored to be able to have watched this series. There were bad times, there were good times, but thats what made it special.  o7
This series will definitely be remembered for a long time ❤❤
What the f did he say about seggs
Why has he stopped playing on the SMP? I haven’t watched in a while, and this makes me quite sad.
Omg that has been such a wonderful time... Thank you so much for sharing this time with us! 😌
Even if I don't watch many smp players anymore this did hurt especially seeing technos old armor in the chest and the disk just brought me back.
Okay.. after a few days, I’m finally ready to play it off like it never happened.
The dream smp will always have a place in my heart ❤️
Hi
o7
sorry gogy...
May DreamSMP be remembered and be the best server out there, it was a adventure... Goodbye DreamSMP...
But why u have to end dream smp
Man, seeing Techno's house made me cry but at least we can all say goodbye to the dream SMP we all loved it and will cherish the memories made with everyone and one last thing. TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES! <3
omg, two tommyinnit videos on the same week, miracle.
</3 o7
I will miss this during Covid we Didn’t have anything to do so every day I would go to YouTube and just see if they were making a video and every time  they did. I was so happy I will miss this the Memories are great seeing techno’s house that’s where it really hit me.
2:45 theres a text that says Bottomtext =)
2:45 Anyone else see that “bottom text”
The dream smp was amazing, but all good things must come to a end
:(
Good riddance.
I just cried while watching this Video 😭😭😭
Thanks Tommy for the 2 videos and 1 stream I fucking dying,I want to see them all😭
Dream sounds different
Good riddance
That was so emotoinal
o7
Was one of the sadest streams ever for me
this server saved my life
Technoblade never dies ❤🐷👑
Okay but why? What's the reason? Why would you all just end it like that
😭😭😭
Best community so glad I found these people sm so grateful!  I will continue to watch them and I will miss the SMP but it was all amazing memories!
I was here o7
Why tommy
the part when he visited techno’s home made me cry so hard
did dreams balls drop?- am i the only one hearing his voice slightly deeper?-
What about Drista
Incredible how far this all went
I remember I started watching right after the L'Manberg Revolution. Seeing Pogtopia, Wilbur's madness, the multiple giant battles, that final duel with Tommy and Tubbo vs. Dream...so many crazy times.  And it sucked that it fell down. It sucked that it just sort of...lost the spark, as Tommy once said. And I would have loved to believe that it would have regained itself one day. All great things must come to an end So that even greater things can start in the future :)
IM NOT CRYING YOU ARE
6:27 Tommy accidentally uses /ban to ban himself along with everyone else like a fool.
thanks for everything thanks for the awesome lore streams! long live Technoblade! DSMP and him will always be in our hearts and will be remembered throughout years!
One word Nostalgia.
im so sad and happy at the same time. DSMP saved me and brought me through some tough times. this brought me tears. theres so much I want to say here, but it would be much too long of a comment. goodbye, dsmp.
Visiting Techno's house is such a wholesome display of memories with him, Thank you Tommy for doing it!   2 years later and I still feel the burden that he's somewhere safe now! 😢
I cried.
Why are they ending the SMP?
No
Those years that it was running, the swearing, tears and the undeniable pissing yourself laughing has all sadly come to an end. I can’t wait to see what the QSMP turns into and what everyone else does.  Thank you Tommy and everyone else for everything.
o7
DreamSMP to be remembered forever
Are you still going to upload?
👏👏👏
Rip techno
Bye Dream SMP the fact that i would wake up every morning just to watch one of the videos is crazy the last 2 years where the happiest years of my life i was crying throughout the video i am probly gonna be cryinhg for the next few hours but its fine the videos that were made on the sever will be missed.
I CAN'T BELIEVE DSMP IS FR JUST GOING AWAY AAAAAAAAA help the tears that came when seeing technos house were real, o7 AAA
Goodbye dsmp I hope techno seen this even he’s in haven I hope he see this. Thank u so much tommy for this wonderful DSMP   -TECHNOBALDE NEVER DIES!!!❤❤btw the techno’s house make me cry so hard
so thats it? wow!
Poggers? Poggers
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!
w server, w people, w life o7
Dream smp is a legend...
even if at some point i found some of you guys kinda annoying, i will miss it, it was really fun.
I’m early but, I’m sad.
Man, I'm gonna miss the DSMP.  Such memories.
I never watched a single episode of the Dream SMP, but this farewell was so emotional and heartful.  Goodbye Dream SMP :')
it's a pity that techno does not see this Tecnoblade never dies
2:45 bottom text
🫡 long live this legend
NO COME BACK
that was weird, weird.
Why is this the last video? I love your vids.
when we are all 40, I want dream to bring this server back, just for spectator mode, so we can remember a simpler time.  when we were little high school students waiting for the next stream
dang
This video made me cry cuz of how many memories there are with that server like fr
what will be the content next for your future vids?
goodbye dream smp, you have been amazing. I will always cherish the memories, thank you dream smp, I’ll miss you ❤
the techno part actually brought tears to my eyes, congrats on the success, to the future
I'm so happy I got to see this live, I have been here through the years with you all and yeah, it's been real.  And that fucking legend that said "the blade has asended" in the chat at the end of the stream to make the boys laugh, you are awesome.  It will feel a bit weird to watch old videos and streams now since it's closed but this was a good way to end the DSMP era. The server wasn't active so this only made sense. This server was one of a kind and I'm happy I got to be a part of it.  Thank you Tom, Toby and everyone <3   Fly High Alex <3
If this doesn’t get a SADist video idk what will…
This was so surreal. It almost felt like I was dreaming during some bits. I almost cried at the end. DreamSMP has honestly helped me so much, emotionally and creatively. I don’t think I could ever put enough words into how much it’s meant to me. Thank you Tommy, and everyone else, for creating this wonderful gem of a series and bringing so many people together. The memories will never die. So long, everybody.
Good bye my friend
o/ man this server was my life for a bit thanks for all the memories!
10:58  Technoblade Never Dies o7
hahahhaha only 4k subs? L fell off
This is amazing, was an honor to be apart of this community :)
It‘s sad that there are so many bots here
Aww this touched my heart Especially Technos house
I’m so glad I got to watch everything happen can’t explain how much happiness dsmp gave me and many others, thanks Tommy
It will be missed
Im literally crying. That final scene with them sitting at the same place they always sat just hit me in the feels.
Farewell Dream SMP. Even though I was late to the party, I enjoyed watching all the streams and documentaries about this awesome server.
Seeing Tommy go to Techno's house in stream broke me....and seeing it in this video again.....man o7  No matter what happens now, the Dream SMP will live on forever.
What about season 2?
Seeing technos house brought tears to my eyes..
Dream wearing technos crown melted my heart
Not tryna be rude or anything but can someone explain why it’s he’s last time on the dream smp ?
Like the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. Thank you for the infinite amount of entertainment you brought to us.
Finally over. 😂
Truly the end of an era
Don’t cry because its over  Smile because it happened 😢
Me and my friends stay up all night watching these videos and seeing this had us d!ying
this server and the ppl on it did so many things for me during quarantine time, its still so unreal. sad to see it gone :/
it feels weird seeing the dream smp end after all of the streams and lore videos we ALL watched
Good bye dream smp, thank you for introducing me to these youtubers i've come to love, and all these tales i have grown up to know.  Thank you for the laughs tears and raging moments. Part of my life was this server and im so happy it happened. Thank you Toms and all of the dream smp for being who you are and sharing it with us This is the tale that was always meant to be  o7
07😭
thank god its over
No tommy thsnk you for everything you and your friends have dont for me the past few years ♥
15:42 i like how he played the same song as when Jschlatt killed the ender dragon, nice callback.
No no tommy sorry ranboo is the main character
Goodbye dream smp it was a great ride
Oh well I suppose this is goodbye
So very sad😢
o7
Finally
It really is the end of an era. Thanks for helping through my darkest times. Goodbye dream smp :)
There was no better ways to end this. Thank you for everything Tommy
Best TommyInnit video ever
Rip
genuinely cant believe it’s been two years!! feels like it was just the other day i was watching lmanberg being created haha! it’s been a good run lads, glad to have been here and experienced this with you guys!! o7
I watched it from beginning to end
that was sad man all endings are sad
This brought tears to my eyes when he visited technos house🥹
wow, no words just wow
how are u so chill bout it?
R.i.p Dream smp😢
Technos house made me cry
thank you for everything
o7
YES THIS IS GONNA BE THE LAST MEMORIES WE HAD ON THIS SERVER
My childhood is over
When he walked to techno and Phil's house.... that made me cry, I had my dad asking me if I was ok 😂 I can't help but think about how techno would have LOVED to help kill the dragon. o7 to the pigman himself because TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!!  🐷 👑
This got me sad as hell
2:45 I saw that "bottom text" subtitle
Thank you tommy
Good bye dream smp 😢😢
Does anyone else agree that "Dream" sounds ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE DREAM BTW, I loved the Dream SMP so much and it made me cry watching this so I really recommend just bingewatching like every single Dream SMP video because there really is just something special about it
2:45 bottom text
Thank god
DSMP WILL NEVER NOT BE REWATCHED AND NO ONE WILL FORGET IT!!!
😢
The fact that this man went into techno's base and then said "what can I steal" just shows how we all never forgot, but also how we can hide pain with comedy. Technoblade Never Dies
Thank you tommy for showing me the best of the best mc players nd a lovely community. Alas all good things come to an end one day. SO LONG BASTARD!!! And Thank You again from the bottom of my heart for helping us through the covid. :)))))
This is my favorite tommy innit video ever in the dream smp EVER!!!!
Can you remake dream smp with all the same people? From the old earth smp that Wilbur soot did?
I never got as into the dsmp as most people. I only regularly watched techno's SMP stuff. But this was just so unavoidable throughout a large and important part of my life. I kinda thought it wouldn't end. I thought it would just go under the radar for a few years until it was brought back to popularity in some way. Things really will never be the same.  o7
o7, to the end of an era
I will miss this forever I cried through the entire thing I miss techno as well when tommy visited his house I could feel pain everywhere
bye dream smp
Using Starjump for the dragon fight... First SMPLive, now Dream Smp.
the dream smp helped me in the worst time of my life. to know it’s over hurts so much. but knowing a new era is starting makes me happy. thank you tommy for this all
Goodbye, Dream SMP. o7
I never really liked the dsmp but this genuinely brought a tear to my eye
Thank you for all the wonderful moments. I will never forget the Dream SMP. Goodbye o7
If sadist doesn’t make an animation of this… immona freak
rip techno....miss you buddy
😢
l love your videos❤
Dream SMP will always have a special place in my heart. From the funniest moments, to even the sad ones, I don't regret joining the DSMP Fandom. Not even a little. Without the Dream SMP, I wouldn't have met many of the people I know today, and all of the amazing people involved in the Dream SMP to make this story possible. We're all sad to see it go, but I'm happy we at least had the chance to see it all unfold. Thank you Dream SMP, for all you've brought. ❤
So that's it...? Waiting for a new great era of tommyinnit, the big man tommyinnit
❤❤TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIESSSSSS!!!!!❤❤
Why did it end
I´LL KILL MY SELF :0 GUYS I SWEAR IF DREAM SMP WAS DESTROYED EXPLOTING I KILL MYSELF LOL HASHAHSAA uh... well goodbye :)
CRAZY how this is someone’s first stream 😭
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Tbh I will miss the dsmp content. It was pleasure to see techno's house again, can't believe it's the end. I started watching dsmp content in 2021 I know I wasn't really around when things started happening but I'm just glad I was there laughing and having a good time while watching the dsmp❤

Such a sweet video and a roller coaster of emotion. Thank you tommy 💛🥲
I haven't been super active in the fandom since the disc saga finale, but watching this had me stewing in all the feels this series has given me over the past two years. This dumb little block game has had such an incredible impact so many lives. To the creators, the fans, & everyone else involved, thank you for the memories <3
Goodbye Dream SMP! Thank you so much for everything. Technoblade never dies! o7! <3 :) It was amazing!
I almost cried while watching toward this part 11:12 😢

o7

In memory of L'Manburg, in memory of Technoblade, in memory of everything that happened on this server and impacted other people's lives. o7. goodbye and joy be with you all.
Thank you very much for entertaining  me through my toughest times im internal greatfull of the memories that you made and from the Dream SMP
Sad to see the finale, but that's just life. I remember the time, around 2021, I discovered Dream SMP, Wasn't too sure about it's humor, fandom & such, and didn't interact with, it during 2022 - Early 2023. But i've been recently looking back at it & all that's changed, Sad to see Techno go, Sad to see the person who introduced me to the Dream SMP go, But it is what it is. Don't be sad it ended, Be glad it happened.  Thanks, Tom.  ❤
Anyone else felt like crying?
Edit: yes I cried at techno’s  house
TECHO NEVER DIES
It hurts to see it go. But we just gotta know that we got the most amazing memories someone could ever ask for.
Even though I left the fandom months ago I still came to watch the ending. Dream smp was my life during the peak of covid. I would come home to school and watch every new video from tommy. The smp was a amazing server and I hope the legacy of the server and technoblade passes on forever. I'm so greatfull for finding this community and it was amazing to be apart of something so big. I cried whenever techno passed and I cried even more after seeing this video and while I watched the finale. After years of watching this commmunity's ups and downs I  cannot believe it ended. Everyone in this community was so nice and ill still check up on people that was included in the smp. TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES 👑👑👑♥Thank you for everything. <3 ♥ o7
Btw if anyone doesn’t know think bad and puffy wanted to do one final goodbye by killing the dragon instead of just leaving it to the Tommy and tubbo final so that’s why
TECHO NEVER DIES
o7 boys, it was always meant to be.
Bro how did a block game save my life iv been here nearly 3 years THREE YEARS!??? bro im gonna miss this so much
TECHO NEVER DIES
TECHO NEVER DIES
o7 guys , I’m going to and still do miss it :)
We will all miss the dsmp but we all know it couldn't continue the same without technoblade, Rip alex, fly high king. Technoblade never dies.
TECHO NEVER DIES
tom is one of my most fav youtubers ever i hope he has a good life
😢
TECHO NEVER DIES
You went to technos base and i immediately started crying
So long dream smp
TECHO NEVER DIES
2:45        bottom text
TECHO NEVER DIES
TECHO NEVER DIES
And remember to subscribe with twitch prime. Goodbye Dream SMP. o7
Rip technoblade fly king
TECHO NEVER DIES
The DSMP was a home, filled with an amazing family. Sometimes old people would leave the community and new ones would enter, but the community was truly a community. We met new people and people made incredible art. It will leave a hole in my heart forever.   I know it’s time for it to be over but it’s sad just the same. I will always miss the exile, lmanburg and pogtopia, and Technos execution.   Technoblade was who I always watched in the smp. He may have uploaded rarely, but I’m convinced it was because he was psychic and knew when we needed his streams the most. He made (and still makes me when I rewatch his streams) laugh whenever I need and the prison podcast and blowing up lmanburg we’re my comfort streams.   o7 Technoblade o7 DSMP  You’ve both made me a better person and I will forever love, miss, and cherish, everything that’s been done :)
TECHO NEVER DIES
Tommy’s finally mlg was epic!!!
TECHO NEVER DIES
Goodbye
TECHO NEVER DIES
TECHO NEVER DIES
TECHO NEVER DIES
I'M NOT CRYING YOU ARE STFU
TECHO NEVER DIES
goodbye
TECHO NEVER DIES
Have fun Tommy
7:29 i can't-
so many good memories, gbye dsmp :D
Rentrons, il commence à pleuvoir.
We will all miss the Dream SMP so much, it was such a big part of all of our childhoods, thank you for this. Technos house had me in tears but this was such an amazing way to end it, thank you Tommy and thank you everyone ❤️
These steams on this sever made my laugh when I was sad,  made me distracted myself from reality it also made me make new friends and to see that there will not be an another Dream smp stream genuinely made me on the verge of tears. Thanks to all the Dream smp    members.
Thx for entertaining me with ur vid especially during COVID. This last few vids of Dream SMP were the best. Thank you tomyinit
Technoblade never dies
I cried at the end😢
It’s over. I thought it was never gonna end, but even the good things must end eventually o7

this stream made me so emotional, and this video just made me cry even more, thank you so much for the memories, Tommy❤️❤️
Bro im crying😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Hi  We love tchno
I am so sad
The most memorable SMP the world has ever seen, the early days with Tommy and the disks, The exiling of Tommy, Dream in prison, Technoblade amazing arc, the Egg and so much more, this SMP has brought me happiness in my time of need and the lore was peak, I remember Technoblade ringing his bell in his streams and the heartfelt arcs of each YouTuber, it’s sad to see it go, but, everything must come to a end at some point, thank you, Tommy, Tubbo, Wilbur, Philza, Skeppy, Dream, Techno and more. The memories you guys made in the SMP will never be forgotten.
I would have been better if they used Techno’s stronghold instead just thought I would share
the dreamSMP will always be remembered. i remembered first watching it during covid. i loved it. so many memories made. visiting technos house one last tome made me tear up. thank you guys, for making an amazing server. goodbye 👋❤
My twitch was not working at all the day the tour stream happened and I was sad to miss it I'm very glad that you've made a video out of it so I can still see it  I will miss this era of our lives, I joined the fandom early 2021 (i think) and it's been a fantastic ride Seeing techno's place again was really bittersweet...
i hate to see something so good die and when i saw Techno's home i cred fr i remembered when the first war and pogtopia  was cool and when techno will always pug his account i will always laugh goodbye techno RIP TECHNO i will remember you goodbye dream SMP
🫡
Someone Make The Dream SMP An Entire Netflix Series Or Something, It Would Fit In Perfectly. What An Emotional Rollercoaster It Has Been. Multiple Tears Have Been Shed Throughout :,)
Eyyyyy starjump for the dragon kill, smp live call back

Let’s have a moment to celebrate the entire Dream SMP, even the bad members, as Tommy said. I will miss this SO SO SO very much, but I can’t wait for what the future will bring. Technoblade Never Dies, may L’manberg live in peace, and shall all the members have great lives.
don't cry because it ended           smile because of the times you had with it
I was here... </3

The dream smp will be missed, I will miss everything you guys did.
The history of dream smp
where is the world download?
watched the stream, almost cried.
womans do not have rights shoot the woman 14:28
Seeing Technoblade's house for the last time makes me sad... (PS I held my tears and try not to cry) Technoblade never dies
Wait no season 2?
🫡
Techno was the only thing holding the SMP from dying..
Tommy….. Thank you 😢
Damn this hit hard. I remember watching the Dream SMP during COVID. Never will this kind of feeling return ever. I wish it didn't end so soon 🥲
This was so cool and RIP KING
These were a great couple of years. Thank you Tommy, for bringing the chaos we needed in one of the darkest times for some. It definitely helped me watching your streams to lighten my mood :D
This server has been a roller coaster of emotions, and I genuinely can't believe that it's over however there is no denying that this server changed many of our ourselves lives for the better and it will always be alive in our memories.  Fuck BadBoyHalo and Technoblade never dies. Have a W day Poggers
When a story begins, there must be an end. Everything was so fast when I realized it was today. I know there's always something new, new servers, new SMPs, new people, but I'll miss this server over and over again.  Of course I still follow all of you. just not feeling the same and I can't move on Two and a half years was a long time but it was too short for me.  And I regret that I live in Asia and don't have enough money to go to the event. I missed out on so many chances that it's a shame, damn it. I want to get out of here  Anyway, love you all and bye DSMP. o7
This almost made me cry.
You've barely posted any vids on YouTube from dream smp lately. Now you hop back on the train.
"bottom text" 💀
Bro made me cry with techno
o7
WHY DID HE END IT 😢😢😢
Im crying. Thank you all, the members of DreamSMP, the fans, all of you. It was a huge chapter of my life, Ill never forget this
This is the moment tommy became Jesse Pinkman 1:44
I don’t have any words man..
Good-bye DreamSMP! I enjoyed every moment, every stream, everyone's character, and this video is a banger! Many tears were accompanied in this series and in this video but we, as a community, will cherish every moment of the DreamSMP, and I hope everyone will continue on their journey of life and create something equally as good.
No... I wanna join the Dream SMP but now it never happened... 🥺🥺
This video was such an emotional roller coaster, and I'm currently on the verge of tears. Thank you to Tommy and everyone in the DSMP for entertaining us during what we thought was the worst time of our lives ❤ o7
Rip alex
The visiting to Technos house got me NGL❤😢😅
I was there when it happened live, almost three years of my life gone, just like that. I appreciate everything the Dream SMP has taught and showed me.  It will forever have a place in my heart. <3
Finally
I may have lost interest in the DSMP, but I'll never forget how much the server and its players helped me during covid. This is a period of my life I'll look back on with a smile.  Thank you, DSMP, and goodbye o7
My l'manburg myyy l'manburg my l'manburg my l'maaaaaaannburg  o7 dream smp, thank you for all the memornies <3
It's been a wild ride, I'm a little sad that Quackity didn't make it and that we didn't get to revisit Las Nevadas, but I'm still so happy that we got to have one last look at this beautiful server, I'm sure Technoblade would've loved to see it again
dude, what a fucking era that was. there was highs, lows, goods, bads, redemption and grief. I will miss this, but it's time to say goodbye. love the memories, the content, the people, the end. 💕
We only miss someone that will be with us forever the blood god techno may he rest in peace
Here from the stream
Who else wants all the members to come back to this server in like 5 years for the dream smp reunion
Still sad looking at the empty Techno compound...
Thank you all for the dream SMP content over the years, it was an amazing journey!
It was great, to have been able to be part of this wonderful adventure and community.
It was a great community. I loved every single thing. I loved dsmp it was just an amazing thing we all needed. I am sorry techno couldn't be there, rip. It was a pleasure watching the streams.
CAN WE SEE DRISTA PLS

Don't be happy it's happened, be glad it's over ❤

1 hour ago
Damn
Him banning dream felt like something 2020 tommy would do
When u visited Technos house i fucking cried dream smp was part of my life😢
I still can’t believe it’s over
I didn’t think I would be emotional from a YouTube video but apparently I have been proven wrong.
I cried when. He went to technos blades place
A shame slime didn't show up, he was my favorite
screaming crying throwing up
2:45 "bottom text."
Its been an honer watching your story of the Dream SMP. feeling good
Omg this brought me to tears Tommy
2:46 D: “bottom text”
The scene in Technoblade’s house really hit me. I still can’t believe he’s gone. RIP King
First time commenting in your vids... Want to say.. I really hope everyone that been in the lore is here and do a final stream (phliza, ranboo, etc). I remember when I stay late up night (3AM) just to watch lives video of technoblade and some of yall videos. I remember when Techno and the other's blew Lmanburgs and us sitting here feel so proud that we are there watching it happening live and we are there witnessing cool and awesome things!! and probably some of us even me imagine what will it feels like playing with all of you that time. Time flies so fast. So fricking fast and I hate it when fun things become just good memories. I really hope Dream SMP ends with the lore being complete and finish but i guess i'm a little satisfied with this. Thanks for the good memories and bye Dream SMP.
Man this video was so emotional 😭😢 thanks Tommy for everything you brought me here and I'm with you Always
why you have to upload well i'm visting my mom in hospital
How fast time went by, I feel it like yesterday I watched you burn that tree.
Goodbye DSMP you will be missed and but never forgotten 😟
Im really sad:(
What an end to a grand era!
so this is the end of the dream smp? I don't even know where to begin. so many streamers and some of my now favourite YouTubers all on this server, I watched as many streams as i possibly could and throughout these years of the dream smp it was so chaotic, but in a good way. I'm going to miss this smp, a lot actually.
Good
so tommyinnit will quit youtube??
I'll miss it...
im not crying you are
XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO
i love dream smp but this ending killing the dragon wasn't much and i really wanted everyone there like u know everyone will, phill, jschlatt, ranboo, Charlie, quackity, jack, karl, snap, fundy, niki, maybe Kristen and I'm  really sorry i only remember these names i swear to god i am the greatest fan of all time i know i never watched a live stream but my computer lags.
May the Dream smp be remembered forever    R.I.P Dream smp 2020 - 2022
Even if i started to distance myself from it in the start of 2022, i think it will always have a spot in my heart <33
I laughed my shit of when he banned everyone
the visit to technos house made me wear my technoblade hoodie and I am happy im wearing it
Those quarantine days…
Tommy, tubbo, ranboo, dream, technoblade THANK YOU!!❤️❤️❤ straight from the heart you have formed a piece in everyone’s heart that we will remember forever and ever. Looking back nobody can believe that this was two years ago, you guys have created something that is going to be apart of everyone forever and on behalf of everyone thank you for everything and we are super great full to be apart of this wonderful story of the dream smp. TECHNOBLADE. NEVER. DIESS.!!!❤👑

I haven't known the dreamsmp long, haven't watched the vlogs except for YouTube bits, and was drawn to it via a sadist video sometime during 2020. You guys are funny and have brought many a good laugh!  Bless you all...
I am not crying you are (┳Д┳)
Rip techno

R.I.P Dream SMP😭
RIP to the SMP
I'd like to think the withers during the fight was techno 🤟
watching these incredible events unfold through techno's perspective was a joy i looked forward to every day. i had a little cry at the end, but i had a huge smile on my face throughout the entire video. technoblade never dies. and thank you to all the people that made this server happen
I’m not crying you’re crying…
Bye dream smp good time we’re made
Holy shit. What an end. I teared up the moment I saw snow and Techno's house in the distance. I dont think I will ever stop being sad about that. This server and this story will never be forgotten until I live.
Bye dream smp ppl :(
😭
R.I.P techno i love u
This is so SAD😢😢😢😢
Goodbye DSMP, it was fun until the very end! I will never forget all the memory I have of it ❤
so long nerds
rip  what a server its been
i cant believe its over. i wanna say thankyou, dreamsmp has been amazing to watch. the lore and even the just messing around. o7
Techno...
This actually really sad  like i have watched this for all of 2020 and 2021 and like was my whole quarantine and its gonna be really sad that this the end
Can u guys release a dream smp map pls?
Nice vid
Incredible SMP. But the fact that Techno couldn’t see it end pains me.  o7. Technoblade never dies
Wow it’s… over all these years good bye dream smp
I’m gonna miss it so much o7
Technoblade would have been happy
ONTO BIGGER BETTER THINGS!
still can’t believe it’s coming to an end, i’ve been here since the beginning and it’s been a ride watching everything happen. the experience was awesome, goodbye Dream smp ☹️👋
Once he went to technos house, i started tearing up. o7 to him..
sobs
He’d do anything to see techno one last time
man, i wish techno could have been around to see this.  o7 to the king
o7
Thanks for a great last few years of content, Tommy :)
The end of an era
This server changed my life
Cried
"Why do you have to say goodbye?.."
Technoblade would have used the steering wheel for the ender dragon fight fr though
I am crying writing this. I didn't catch the stream and this is my first time watching - I didn't think I would care, but I'm so glad I watched. Thank you, Tom, for this closure that I never knew I needed P.S. Rest in Power Technoblade o7
Don’t be sad it’s over, just be glad this amazing show happened. Also, for plot sake, I believe that Dream XD had resurrected them after the nuke and they agreed to be at peace, and everyone else on the server agreed and they decided to kill the dragon for the final episode. Also I think blowing up buildings was a little much!
I really felt it when you went to visit techno's house❤️
i'll miss the dream smp, also i gotta admit, to anyone who ever watched the amazing world of gumball, am i the only one who thinks tommy is kinda similar to gumball-
Jschlatt smplive remake anyone?
14:31 and here we have a Human shooting a woman with wings😂
L
It is so sad seeing the one thing that saved and kept me and so nany people happy go. I am more then grateful for this server and for all the amazing moments in brought us. Thank you so much. I will never forget this.
Ok
Goodbye Dream SMP you will be missed (I cried when you went to technoblades house)
This server has been extraordinary! On the best or worse days, you all log on to continue on with the story line and its honestly the beat thing ever.  I truly can't believe we've been in this journey with the dsmp for nearly 2 years and a half! And now coming to an end😭  I just want to say, Thank you Tommy and to the rest of the dsmp members for sharing this incredible journey of your server and even of your lives! Thank you Tommy for being able to go to Techno's house, it must've been hard and it really did bring tears to my eyes.   Thank you for everything, we all support you and want to be able to be with you in all your journeys through youtube💗
😔
If you wanna make a grown man cry, then just show them this video.

Goodbye dmsp, I will miss this. And rip techno, We will all miss you.

Tbh i thought dsmp had already ended
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
I watched every single one of your videos, the wars and stuff you did on this server, I will always remember the server and I just broke, you're still watching this.
😢
After everything went down, the wars, the betrayals, the hilarious bits, this is where it ends, and god damn I’m gonna miss it. I don’t even really know how to wrap this comment up, I’m just shocked I guess, goodbye fellas
Remember everyone, don't be sad that it's over, be happy that it happened
Goodbye dream smp hello new world
Your videos always made my day better
After 3 years, finally 🙌
So cool video 👍🆒😎
Pog
Thank you for showing us technoblades home again 😭😭

o7
First technoblade gone and now the DSMP ends, we have so many memories of this thanks for the amazing and funniest content on the DSMP.
i promise im not sad :(
Tommy it’s been a wish and honour watching your lives and even videos on the dream smp I am grateful from all the lores and everything else ❤ We will always be here for you. It’s been funny watching you guys fight wars l’manburg and even this video was a banger. I hope to see you in the future. Ps my cousins saw you on your bike at Brighton lol. Anyways bye mate thank you for everything.
Goodbye Dream smp you will forever be missed ❤
Damn, this hits hard ngl

It has been a great journey  “Technoblade never dies” ❤
Dude fell off
o7 Dream Smp RIP Technoblade
I cried during the visit to Techno's house. This server was honestly great and I loved watching these content creators grow. Technoblade never dies ❤
NO TOMMY

Amazing series. Great job
I’m crying so hard right now. Watching you visit techno’s house was so sad yet brought joy at the same time <3
teared up
I just miss techno, i could live without ever having seen the rest, but not having him with us hurts the most.
Best finale ever
The end of an era😭
🕊 techno
Ok
I swear I nearly cryed😢
😞😞😞😞 long live dream smp
Hell yeah! Biatch!
10:58 As soon as I saw snow, I knew where Tommy was going and tears began to fall from my eyes  o7
I thought the dream smp ended months ago
bro really rejected niki *(poor niki)*
I see tommy emotion in techno house was respect he try to make us laugh and not make us too seriously man... i give you respect Big Respect  (If technoblade i mean.. Alex was there it will be the masterpiece... Rest in peace alex i hope you see everyone kill that ender dragon) GOODBYE DREAMSMP YOU WILL BE LEGEND SMP EVER!!!! AND THE LAST THING TECHNOBALDE NEVERDIE!!!!!!!!
The thing is that the Dream SMP was amazing to see and the most thrilling part and the most epic part was to see technoblade’s house I miss him I wish he can ring the bell one last time but he is he is ringing it in heaven and all I got to say TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES👑🐷
I'm so happy he ended this on a high note:')
Wow
callback to the smplive ending. what an amazing server, and thank you for being there
I love how even tho you didnt have the best armour, you didnt take Techno's. Rip Techno
Took you guys to long🔥🔥🔥🔥
The techno blade one was going to make me cry 😢😢😢 techno blade never dies R.I.P to legend🕊🕊
That kinda hurt ngl
I love this seres
At first, I found Tommy kind of annoying, but I got used to him. And now that Technoblade has departed, I hope I can make as much memories as I did with Technoblade. Thanks for going to his house one more time, even though I don't have time to watch his streams. This was the second time I've really cried in years. Thanks for all the upcoming memories.
I wish it didn't end
nooooooooooooooo
I was tearing up because my life was watching these videos for most of my life and it was nice to see the end as well
Early gang
This journey has been so incredible. I’m so grateful that I got to come along for the ride! o7
Finally
o7
🙋‍♂️
part from techno fans all of us fatherless will miss it
I though the last stream was done and wait is this a video of the stream
damn. The tranquil walk through technos house could bring tears to any man.
Holy shit that last scene flickering through the timeline in like two seconds before the disconnect was so cinematic. Like life flashing before your eyes before you die. RIP Dream SMP
What a journey, who knew such a monumental journey would start with dream and George just walking around playing normal survival and dream wheezing at George. How something so small turned into something that had a whole script and lore. Where at the end of a random stream a blonde haired kid would be invited to join and get banned the same day, the day it all started. We had fun, we theorized, we cried and we became shocked just trying to see what comes next. It all ends now and forever, from the first block broken to the last hit given to the dragon and the last disc listened too, it’s over. Goodbye DreamSMP and thank you for everything you’ve done for us ❤
Technoblade never dies
I didn’t even watch it yet but I feel like the ship has sailed farewell
Can’t wait for the dream smp 2 where everyone has a sequel
1:03 I’m the main character
It's almost like the last day of school before summer. Every experience,  bad or good, carried  onwards to the next amazing thing each of these creators will do.
not me trying to hold back tears at the techno part 😭
finally
finally where was so much finales
It’s been a long time 😂
One thing the fact the dream amp ended right after his birthday 😢
All good things come to an end. But we need to be happy about all the things that happened. Be happy it happened not sad it ended
I've been here since the start... how to sex was the longest joke ever
o7  Everyone will know
Pls tell me Im not the only one who cried during the whole video :')  Goodbye Dream smp  It brought us so many memories and so many disasters for two years and a half :)
Tommy for the soundtrack for the ender what’s it called?
😭
o7
Feeling sad and nostalgic even tho i was new
We all knew this was gonna happen one day but it hits hard I mean watching for two years and now it’s over 😭
2 years, this server didnt just mean a lot to the people that played on it, but to everyone that watched it, it was a relief from covid, it provided an escape. It's sad to see it go, but it was a great ride to watch it through the years. o7 Dream SMP
Goodbye dream SMP❤❤❤
Best moment, ah I'm getting touched!
nooooo :(
8:48 no way he just did that
Thank you guys for this server.
Has anyone noticed that if you pause at 2:45 on the video that it says bottom text?
I haven't been too into the recent lore, but this actually had me a little choked up, I'm not gonna lie.  I started watching during L'manburgs arc and it's crazy to think that this silly little server brought me closer to one of my best friends of today - if it hadn't have been for the Dream SMP, I don't think I would have met my best friend, or had some of the greatest memories I had during COVID, so I guess I have it to thank for that :)
I can't wait for the returning video. I KNOW THERE WILL BE ONE!!!
And now we wonder when will the next major smp emerge and who will make it
All things must come to an end😔
Goodbye SMP well never forget the great things you brought, Techno would be proud. Goodbye ❤
this was really nostalgic and a little bit sad. thank you Dream SMP. 🫡🫡🫡 also that visit to techno's house brought tears to my eyes. TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!♥️🫡♥️🫡♥️🫡
jlkljn
RIP Dream SMP
THIS IS SO FUCKING EMOTIONAL WTH
Cried a bit :') Thank you for amazing 2 years! <3
o7 DreamSMP o7 Lmanburg, and most importantly o7 Technoblade
doesnt it say almost in the description?
Lets go it ended 💯🔥🔥
11:23 I think the disc was one last gift from techno. I miss him. I think we all do.
Ive never been this fukin early to a video and for the first time i dont know what to say...  Thank you dsmp and thank you right back tommy <3
USE CODE TOMMY INNIT IN THE FORTNITE ITEM SHOP!
this will blow up maybe his most viewed (at the moment like 61k views)
I’ve been watching the Dream SMP for so long and it feels like it was just yesterday that it was created. It was great while it lasted, but we will forever remember it. Visiting Techno’s house brought back so many memories. TECHNO NEVER DIES!
I’m not crying my eyes are just cosplaying as a waterfall-   Btw I’ve been watching since day one. I started watching you with my cousin and it was amazing. I remember when everything was just nothing but a brick house and a farm. I love you so much Tommy and I’m glad that I was here for the whole journey ❤️
long live tecno long live the king. <3
This better be a joke I hope this is a joke I have literally watched every stream watch every video of every creator I am known to man of the smp if this is not a joke, I’m going to cry for days in the week on months and everything
I don’t know what to say except for thanks for bringing us on this ride big man. Thank you, pog, and goodbye! <3
This video only came 50 min ago and already has 3300 comments lol
See ya dream smp thanks for changing all our lives for the better
Thank you for all the amazing memories. Ill never forget how much fun I had watching everyones videos, especially yours, Tom. thank YOU for everything :) o7
This SMP felt like it was apart of my life. I can’t believe it’s been two years. Every time I would have a bad day (and was at a bad stage in my mental health) watching streams especially Wilbur’s, Tommy’s and Tubbo’s streams made me so happy and I’m so grateful to have seen and been apart of this fandom because people over the years are going to look back and remember this and people who had no idea about it are going to wonder why it had such an impact on people and we will smile and laugh when that day comes. The DSMP has helped me personally so much. During Covid times it was one of the only good things I enjoyed watching even before it “took off” and everyone knew about it. I’m just so happy for all the memories. o7 to Technoblade, he would have loved  to see this day I’m sure 🕊️❤️ Thank you DSMP. Thank you Tommyinnit 🫶
It was an honor watching this can’t wait to see what is next
INNIT
technos house <3 :')
this feels like an amazing ending to some very chaotic but passion filled movie...
I was crying
Damn took long enough
I’m crying 😭
That last look before he jumped into the ender portal was everything
an o7 for everyone in the server that brought smiles to the faces of us, the fans, during our toughest times. o7
I was here
PLEASE WHY NOOOOOOO PLEASE PLEASE
the whole video i was like: " Im not gonna cry, Im not gonna cry." the moment it hit me was the moment the flashbacks came in. im so proud of you for making such good videos and stuff. I kind of grew up with the dream smp. im not surprised that i started crying, even tho im not that into the dream smp anymore, but all the good memories, man. it feels like the dream smp has been there forever, and now, its gone. fun fact: i was always watching only your lore streams :)  Thank you so much, Tommy. Thank you for being yourself.
Did dreams voice get deeper or?
Wait, this is Tommy’s last stream? Is he not streaming anything anymore, or just not DSMP stuff? Either way, the Dream SMP has been such fun for the past 2 years, especially the lore side of things, (L’manberg, First Election, Disc War, etc.) and is how I discovered many content creators! I’m sad that it is no longer around (apart from the download), but at the same time I am glad it happened. Tommy visiting the most memorable places on the DSMP made me reminisce on all the good times this server brought us throughout its existence, and made me nostalgic for 2020 (somehow)! Rest in Peace, DSMP and Technoblade ❤️
finally dream is over
:=====(
I was there for the final stream, and now i was there for the final video. Goodbye dsmp.
1st
well maybe i didnt watch most of this (cause it kinda got boring after i watched Techno send pipebombs to Lmanburg again) but still it was kinda nice :). As they say when one legend dies another is born
😢this is so sad but we all will forever cherish the memories ❤
Welp
Tommy, thank you so much for all of the smiles and laughs your brought to me through this server. Even when I was at my lowest, I could turn to your content and the DSMP and feel like I had a sense of home. Thank you and I can’t wait to see what you do next 🫡❤️❤️
thank you tommy for giving me and everyone such amazing memories <3
Its amazing how far this SMP has grown and how Ive grown with it. I remember seeing that a member was streaming and just joining to see the craziest things happen. This was a big part of my life as well and I will really miss it. Thank you tommy for bringing happiness to all of us... PS: o7 Techno
54 minutes ago the world lost hope😢
11:28 ;(
Tom spent like, a ninth of his life (ish) as a member of this server. It’s kinda weird to see such a huge part of Tommyinnit go.
Man you got me all emotional and all freack  🥲  Dream smp and your videos particularly were  so so great for me you know . I'm the same age as you so I know just right the feeling of covid and being stuck and all but this server it entertained me so much back then..  It was  perfect for me who was watching a  bunch of the people on the server beforehand like Wilbur, Schlatt, Dream, techno philza quackity. All of these i had been watching already so when they all decided to get on the same server it was just the best thing I could ever hope and I adored it.  I discovered it thanks to wilbur's videos and that's where I found out about you, at first i know it's a meme but I actually found you annoying but funny annoying. But then I got in my recomended this video like "why you should watch tommyinnint" from a tiny youtber so I gave you a shot lmao.  No regrets at all your videos are in some way relatable because of my age, but I instantly found them very fun with your chaotic behavior when it was you and Tubbo that was hilarious. The Dream smp really and especially your videos  made my days really better since and now that's it's over I'm a tad bit sad but happy at the same because of how great and how big it turned.  Like I remeber seeing this photos of you and your friends at Twitchcon with so many fans behind it's insane And they still do I love to see how you've grown as person and a youtuber like how it feels you're fullfilled to be able to hang out with your favorite youtubers  Anyway if you read this that would be wonderful i'm just another subscriber but Do know that I really enjoyed  the dream smp and that I still enjoyed every single one of your videos i'm always entertained Anyway a huge huge huge thank you for making the days of 16-now 19 yo way better since 2020 you are the best and just keep going man that's it  Have a good one
"Do not be sad for what you have lost, be happy for the experience." -Linda Harper
Hopefully S2 will be dope
What 😭 no
This almost made me cry, especially the sunset. It was so amazing. I can't believe it ended. I hope tommy will be in the next United Smp server or it will suck.
This whole server, everything, meant quite a bit to me. I guess I wasn't a true DSMP fan, I didn't crosswatch streams for all the lore, I didn't see all the story, but I really enjoyed what I saw, and this genuinely made me cry. Good times may come to an end, but the friends, the memories, and the good times will always stay. Thanks for making me happy by lockdown, thank you for the story, the improv, the beauty of it all. And thank you, for being there when I really needed it.
The dream SMP holds many memories, this day had to come someday.🥲💗✨
Huge respect for the Techno part, and we can all agree the Dream SMP had a good run. Farewell.
so glad to see it over
:)
i was never all that big into dsmp kinda just observed from the sidelines and now i kinda wish that i had been more interested. Maybe whenever dsmp 2 comes out I will watch some streams and stuff
Yes
this stream was so good fr
Great SMP comes to an end
this made me cry i will miss everything <3
My volume was too loud when I started this video and I blew out my eardrums
yay
Nnnnnnooooooooo
i loved the watching everyone grow up on this smp i have no words for how much im going to miss it😭😭😭😭😭😭RIP
this server made my life what it is today. thank you, dream smp. goodbye.
Bru
the techno part made me sob like a baby
So sad, but nice at the same time!
I will miss this gg tom😢
Two years have passed, two years of good memories, because an important member of Dream SMP has passed away due to an illness, this series cannot be continued, but don't be sad, what was supposed to happen, always was. Those memories of two years, will never be forgotten by anyone, everyone who saw it will always remember, Tommy, Tubbo, Dream, Wilbur, Technoblade, Fhilza, Eret, Nikki, Ranboo, Captain Puffy, Jscharllatt, Quackty, Fundy, and the other members. The farther you get from the beginning, the further you've come and the closer you are to the end, if you've reached the end with someone, that someone is your friend, if you've reached the end and look back, you'll see everything you've been through and you'll be happy that you've been through, that you've made it this far, that you've made it to the end, you realize that all the memories were good and you don't regret anything and everything was meant to be.  Bye Dream SMP, everything was meant to be.
Fucking finally
Why am I crying?
Is Season 2 cancelled? I haven't been able to keep with news
dream smp never dies !
T-T
It whould have have been better with technoblade...  Ps:we miss u technoblade o7
I'm not crying your crying.  Thank you Tommy for everything u have done throughout these 2 years. We will all miss the Dream SMP but we will always remember everything that had gone down. We love you Tommy!❤
Pls upload morre ;-;
Dream SMP really was just a comforting place that helped so many people through lockdown and more, we loved every moment. Although many of us sort of grew out of it eventually as the years went by, it’s still so nostalgic and heartwarming to look around and relive old memories and stories that we were so engrossed and captivated by for nearly 3 years that felt like such a core part of that time of our lives. I mean i remember texting with my friends during streams reacting to everything and obsessing the day after. Thank you for making it such a wonderful thing to be a part of man :)
"don't be sad it ended, be happy it happened"
This bring tears to my eyes
The killing of the ender dragon was for Techno.
The Dream smp was the best part of my life, i really enjoyed it, and Thank you <3
8:08 uhhhhh
o7
yuck
Why am I crying
Rest in peace. Dream smp & Technoblade. You never die.
MAN
4:20 Nooooooo not sex
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO T~T WHY TOMMY WHYYYYYYYYY
THIS IS THE BEST YEAR AND A HALF OF MY LIFE I HAVE EVER SPENT
those were the good old dayss :] rip  techno and rip dream smp
Dammm ❤
IM NOT CRYIMG YPU ARE!!!
This server changed millions of lives man
10:59 E
God damn it. Looking back on my years of watching and obsessing over this series I think of it being such a shitty, sad, and cringey time. Looking back though, it brought so much happiness and comfort during the fucked years of covid, ittle always honestly be a kind of big part of me, Thank you.
Oh the Techno part made me cry so much :(
as many people have said before me, when they are talking about stuff- such as things-
Who else died laughing at the exploding Hotel and Dream getting Banned?😂
This was sk sad to watch😔
o7
Thank god it’s the last one
W
DID ANYONE EVER GET THE EGG AT THE END
It’s so heart warming that Tommy went to Technoblade’s house for the final time…      BUT WHY ARE YOU STEALING HIS MAN!?
This video was perfect to finish the SMP it’s been a blast 🫡
Can’t believe it 😢
8:09 Gay Spawn
I thought I was done crying over the dsmp being over.  _I was wrong._
I almost cried when i saw technoblade house :( i miss him so much
only real man cried during this
gamer
2:45 editors just left a “bottom text” there lmao
even though we all knew that eventually this day would come, i’m just happy this SMP happened.
i have never been so proud to be subscribed to tommyinnit as i am now. currently crying thank you for everything.
We will always remember the dream smp.
no one cares about the dream smp and they just copied the world
Thank you for everything that happened in the Dream SMP, you all made everyone's nights and days while pandemic ❤❤❤ thanks for everything and you visiting techno's base made me remember all the memories 🥺😭💕
That final disk listen with Tubbo will always make me cry. So many good memories. I think my favorite vod will always be the one where you teamed with Techno in exile. It was the first vod I watched and what made me decide to get into the lore. The swearing at BadBoyHalo videos hold a special place in my heart. They were the first TommyInnit videos I ever watched. I barely knew half the swear words in it and didn't understand some of the jokes, but now I regularly say all those words and understand each joke. I guess I learned a lot from Tommy😂 Thanks for teaching me to swear! This stream was a roller coaster of emotions. I cried within the first 5 minutes. 5 MINUTES! And all because of the song you played at the start. It was the one you used to hum to at the start of every stream. Can't believe it's been over 2 years. I'm excited to see what you'll do now! I know no matter what it is, it'll be incredible. ❤🤍  P.S.- That merch drop on May 12 will be the reason I go broke. All of the merch you've leaked so far looks incredible!
I am so amazed to see that the dreamSMP has grown and its coming to an end because it's been a bit long. Even if the dreamSMP has ended, it will still be funny to look back at it.
2:46  Bottom Text
The techno part made me tear up 😢
Wow good ending man when i first discovered tommy in the covid lockdown i was having fun watching tommy prank dream and his friends smp and this smp give me one of the best time i ever could've have it was the first time I start watching stream and enjoy the lore this server is special to me and it will be in my heart forever ❤😢
We will miss this shit…
I’m gonna say it I never really minded anything about dream smp but watching it end made me tear up
ᴼⁿˡʸ ᵗʳᵘᵉ ᵖᵉᵒᵖˡᵉ ʷʰᵒ ᶜᵃⁿ ʳᵉᵃᵈ ᵗʰⁱˢ ᵏⁿᵒʷ ᵗᵒᵐᵐʸ ʷᵃˢ ᵗʰᵉ ᵇᵉˢᵗ ᶜʰᵃʳᵃᶜᵗᵉʳ ⁱⁿ ᵗʰᵉ ᵈʳᵉᵃᵐ ˢᵐᵖ
I will never forget this world, the people, the story, I will never forget Technoblade..
I’m so damn grateful for you guys, to creating this server, for the opportunities it’s given you all of you, and just for the laughs. I loved the dream smp and I’m looking forward to seeing everyone on there new paths! (I’m not crying you are)
The end of an era... thank you so much for what you've done with the Dream SMP, it definitely wouldn't have been as fun without you. (Plus, you got a few other people in.) Thanks for the laughs throughout the SMP!
😢😢😢😭😭😭💔💔💔
Techno's streams on the server was a rare highlight from quarantine, seeing his house again definitely brought back some emotions o7
This happened on my cat’s birthday! …😢😢😢😢
O7 dsmp. you brought a lot of joy to me whenever I watched people stream on it. May you, and techno rest in peace. ❤
For the 2 years I’ve been watching I just have to say thank you for being one of the YouTubers to make me smile during Covid  And I can’t wait for the cool/amazing projects you and your friends do in the future ❤️🙂
RIP the SMP server. Thank you Tommy for a great adventure
It's just one of those moments where you're just happy and sad at same time
Thank you Dream SMP! I wouldn’t have gone to Vidcon 2022 and met some of the best people if it wasn’t for Dream SMP panel. I wouldn’t have the laughter and the tears of watching this server. I wouldn’t have meet Techno through Pogtopia and adore his amazing writing and acting skills (and not to mention his humor)! The Dream SMP may’ve have been just a server to some, but to those who were there for it, it was so much more… Thank you do much for everything! ❤
-10M viewer xD
o7 I'll miss this little corner of my life, the little memories, the light through the thick of covid, truly I'll miss this. The chaos was all worth it! It's been a pleasure seeing this with all of you, and seeing it through the streams, two and a half years (almost) of my life steamed to a memeory I'll always cheerish. I LOVE YOU ALL, HERE ARE SOME GOOD VIBES FOR YOU, and remeber, only a small portion of tommy's veiwers are subscribbed, you might find him annoying at first, but it's all worth it sooner or later, PS:  The visit to Techno's house bought me to tears, thank you, Techno never really did die, his legacy will live on, goodbye.
That's crazyy
i guess this is the end, i enjoyed it while it lasted.
I want Techno to see that.. i wish he was there.
Long live dream smp.
lets go
This was an amazing 2years, almost 3! I’m happy that the Dsmp happened, it sad for it to go but this was amazing, im excited for the future!
Seeing dsmp for the last time without techno being there just made me so sad
I have watched this entire series of events from the very start and watching you grow has been my everyday dream and seeing lots of friends and memories adding up to make up one hell of a server has cheered me up every time I have been upset at anything and I have enjoyed every single bit of it. This was bloody amazing and has inspired me for my future life so at the bottom of my heart thank you ❤❤❤
Is Tommy quitting being a YouTuber
Pog
And technoblade never diess
Cool video
Watermelons
I watched the SMP since January of 2021 at the lowest point of my mental health. I'm eternally grateful for these kids turned men.
I’m Sad I Will Miss This So Much
What happen to dream voice
The video came out before I finished the vod LMAO. I'll miss this SMP.
George fr about to sleep through the end of the server, what a classic Georgenotfound moment  Edit: nvm he woke up

Goodbye dream smp😢
Dream SMP is now a history with a good  ending. Yet it's still so sad to realize that it's over. I'm happy that we have all these good memories about this story. It will always have a special place in our hearts
Thanks for the send off not many do this. It was nice while it lasted. I'm Glad I was here when it happened, but now time for bigger and better things. Good bye Dream  Smp.
fucken hit me in the feels man.
Goodbye Dream smp
Keep it going,    I heard there was a special place
End of the greatest era😢😢😢
Tommy: **goes to Techno’s old house** Me: **on the verge of tears** Tommy: “any last things I can steal?” Me: *PFFFFFFFFFT!*  Day made.
Noooo
This was a rollercoaster of emotions , from laughs and giggles to revisiting technos cabin , to the finally. This was something special
Why
took you long enough
I wasn't expecting to get so emotional at this video
Last video of the dream SMP ever and my like made the 9.9k up to 10k.   The dream SMP has changed my life, not as much as yours or anyone directly involved with it however I’ve made friendships from this server and it’s genuinely helped me through a time I didn’t think I could be helped.
o7
Hes not quitting youtube is he? Pls say hes not
this all was only thanks to hannah😊
An end of an era 😔
damn bruh there goes my covid
<=3
As someone who’s watched his streams ever since day 1, it’s crazy to think we were in the moment of nostalgia not thinking this server would become so big. Now it ending is just so sad and we never realized how sad it would’ve been if this moment came
😢
o7 everyone.
Crazy amazing love it
❤️
The Dream SMP with EVERYTHING that happened, will be remembered forever, LITERALLY, FOREVER

So many people were struggling for the past couple years and the amp was there to comfort us. Thank you for everything.❤
I’m so grateful that I found this community. It ALWAYS made me so happy when I felt sad, angry, or stressed. It’s sad that it has to end but it was truly one of the greatest experiences in my life. Thank you DreamSMP and everyone in it for making my days a lot better. Me and millions of others. ❤ o7
its been here since covid and honestly pulled me through. thanks dream smp! you rocked!!
I remember around a year ago, someone from the dsmp said that once dsmp was over they would all kill the dragon. Cant believe that time has come, ty for the memories! Cant wait to see what’s next for all of them <3

Damn, welp that's the end of something but the start of something good (ps:Tommy achieved his goal of getting milfs)
Awg man in the carantine you was the perfect person to watch lore/videos i remember when my shcool was over i was opening your old videos every f time and in my class i was watching your videos, after i was watching technoblade and man he was so fucking poggers he made me laugh when i was sad and gave me confidence. Philza, i remember i did an project with him i was talking lovely about him and his wife and i remember i was watching his twitch streams every day when he was live like i couldnt miss a single one. There are so much more to say about dream, sapnap, George, hannah, slime, schlatt, ponk, bbh etc but i will keep in my memory all these memories to remember the good old times. Next year im into highschool yesterday i was in 5 grade :))
I was here o7

Bye DSMP, we will miss you more than any of us could ever imagine. Goodbye, old friend, and here's to all of the adventures to come!
Best vid I've seen this year probably
What a great time. All the streams, all the memories. It was so hard for me not to cry when Tommy went to Techno's home. It's still hard to believe he's gone. The Dream SMP was what got us through Covid and so much more. Thank you Tommy, Technoblade, Tubbo, Dream, Wilbur and everyone else for making it what it was. God Bless 💓
Or is it….
LETS GOOOOO THE CHILD ATRACTER 2000 IS GONE
I am going to cry all night today I already want it back.
I love you so much tommy your so cool I'm so glad I've been here the whole time thank you tommy.
thank god its over
I really hope that bee killing made tubbo started a new war and dsmp would stay on forever.
Rest in peace technoblade 🕊️ o7
Thank you for all the great content and memories  😭 i will miss them
Love the way how Tommy was respective when he was at techno's house
I just wish technoblade could've been here for the end.
Can't believe tommy died
The dream smp
Literally sobbing rn
damn
i am so grateful for this server and all the streams. this would make me so happy in 2020, and im glad i could watch it thrive.
Tommy i got the quote book today in the mail and i managed to read it in about 2 hours, i hate reading but i loved this book its truly a work of art and i love the little comments will made on the so called advice you were giving 💀💀 you guys should definitely make another one its awesome!!!!!
I want to say thank you to everyone involved in the dream smp for making such an entertaining show/story that i will never forget :)
What’s the up of it
well now im in tears so thanks tommy for making such a great video i bloody cried
Thanks for this, we did not deserve this tommy, but thank you.
Bye
Technoblade never dies o7
Crying right now Thank you for EVERYTHING, love y’all!
i kinda joined in late, but ive still been in this fandom for a year and a half, im rly gonna miss this. i hope some fans keep making new tiktoks, playlists, fanart, and stuff
o7 techno and dream smp
RIP RIP
I just found out my cousin is pregnant, she is thirteen
May technoblade AND the dsmp rest in peace
In a moment of silence, Technoblade never dies. Atleast in our hearts...
Technoblade never dies 🐷👑
Cya end of a goated era
Will there be another SMP in the future?
His eyes were so Shiny when he went to Techno's house... I would've definitely cried if I wad in the stream. O7 technoblade, you'll alwahs be in our heart
I loved the dsmp and I will forever cherish that time but after it got big and new fans came flooding in everything just became so toxic and I distanced myself from the community. I then basically only watched Philza and Techno and after the cancer announcement I stopped watching almost completely. Now I don’t think I can ever watch them again now that Techno‘s gone and everything‘s different. I guess it’s sad how things change but at the same time things always change and that’s not a bad thing. Maybe I‘ll still check in sometime to see how everyone‘s doing, but the important thing is that I and many others had a great time with the dsmp and will remember it for a long time. So thanks for everything and I wish all the people here good luck for the future :)
It’s been an honour big man
i did start crying
I was in that Stream 😢 I literally cried so hard 😔
Thank God it's over
o7 i don't actually know what to say I have been her since covid :,)
Seeing techno’s house brought back so many memories. Techno never dies <3
Don't cry because it happened. Be thankful that it's over. 🙏
Why is dreams voice different?
yea i was here
Tom, and everyone involved made a culture and an era in a time where many where missing this connection, entertainment, and generally enjoyable wealth of people this series served. It was truly enjoyable, a rollercoaster and seeing this chapter end is not as sad as I would’ve thought. It feels like a new and more fulfilling journey is going to begin, and I am so excited to see that continue. The streams where fun and the story was engaging, and even though the server felt abandoned after quarantine ended, it really was nice to see most of the server come back for the final chapter.
Why am I like crying I wasn't even that into dream smp, I don't know half of the things that happened
Good job tommy
o7
Goodbye dream Smp
GUYS PAUSE AT 2:46 IT SAY “bottom text” >:D
I can't believe that it's all over. I loved every second I spent watching the DreamSMP, and now it's all gone. All we have left now is old videos memories and the youtubers, but soon all the youtubers will be gone and all the memories will die and all that will be left is the videos no one in the future generations will even look at. It's sad to live and see the DreamSMP grow unpopular as time goes by and watch as it's slowly forgotten by time and as soon as our generation dies out, no one will be alive to remember the great memories that were made whilst watching it, because the memories will die with us all. It's the sad truth and I wish it wasn't but it is. It's even sadder when you realize that all these amazing youtubers that took part in this will pass on them selves and the DreamSMP will only then, truly die. It's when something end do you suddenly start to stare face to face with your own mortality and that sometimes scares me.  Edit: yeah, the 2020's have so far been the worst decade ever, WE CANT GET A BREAK!!!!!!
This can’t be it
Tom YOU BETTER NOT QUIT DSMP I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN
Why 😭😭😭
Goodbye Dream SMP.  Gone but not forgotten.
Rip technoblade. And goodbye dream smp.
Bruh
Nice just nice
0:20 read how to sex
… and that’s the end.
Go buy Technoblade merch right now
❤
Finally, the DSMP Is over
The part where he visits Techno & Phils Cottage got to me 😭
The End.
I think we are all grateful to have had this server and entire series for us for when we needed it the most. I'm so sad to see it go, but so happy and thankful that it happend.  Goodbye Dream SMP, Thank you for everything. ❤
Seeing techno’s house hit hard
somebody tell me why im almost in tears
"Don't cry because its over, Smile because it happened"
I started watching DSMP back in 2020, right at the start, and I will say an absolute thank you to everyone, all the creators and fans for making it such a truly loveable and enjoyable 2-3 years. Thank you DSMP for creating special memories, we will never forget what the server and everything meant to everyone! You have been such a big part of our lives and we all grew up watching you all and that's so special! Thank you for everything again, we will miss it but are glad to be a part of it o7.  <3
thank you so much for these last years tommy, it's been an absolute blast <3
i watched dsmp since april 27th 2020, i'm crying so much seeing one of my most favourite things ever end rn 😭i knew it would have to end sometime but still hurts to actually see it happen. im still glad the dsmp existed and was a major part of my life though. o7

Dream smp will be remembered
Don't cry because it's over, smile because you were there when it happened.

Finally, it’s over
Thank you Tommy been watching u since the start of the dream smp, I teared up a but at going to technoblade house and the last part thsnkmyou Tommy   Technoblade never died...

YAY
NOOO
:(
o7
Nice
i'm confused
anytime Tommy isn’t chaotic, and actually getting a tiny bit emotional, I want to cry-
I hoped this video would never come. So much has happened. The smps gained people lost people ( rip techno) and had it's ups and downs. The smp has been such a big part of so many people's lives and I can't believe that it's over. The stories and gameplay that has come with it are unforgettable and spectacular. You will never find anything as good as the Dream smp. It will always have a place in my heart.
so glad i was there to see it live. thanks for all the memories
Let's have a 1 minute silence and remember the best things about what happened in the dream smp we will all miss you dream smp🥹🥹🥹🥲🥲
open a tommy smp and R.I.P DREAMSMP
Bro this hits so hard, after 2 years of memories
Dream smp we will miss you for creating such memories technoblade never dies💔❤️‍🩹
i saw your live on twitch about it
this is the end.
Damn, the part where he visits Technos house hit me hard. rest in peace king
Thanks so much Tommy
You know, this would’ve been even better if there was a moments reel at the end including photos, moments, etc.
I was crying rip techno and Dream smp
Rip

Even though we won’t be getting a season 2, I can still sleep peacefully, knowing that the characters of the SMP are living on, even if we aren’t there to watch.  Goodbye Dream SMP.
o7
Rest in Peace dream SMP now we can log in and visit techno's house to keep the memory alive
This was fun , the dream smp will forever stay inside here
😢⚔️goodbye suckers
Im not crying u are
So sad to see it end
its ngl so sad😢 but late upload it was a long time ago
TTTTOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMYMYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what will make me sadder, is techno blades base just sitting there, untouched, forever waiting for someone who will never come.
So no season 2??
I’m so happy to have lived in a time where I could experience this smp
NOOOOOOOOO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Tommy looking through Techno’s stuff genuinely made me start crying. So many memories were made on this server and it was one of my first fandoms ever. Dream SMP actually made me so happy for years and seeing it end makes all those memories flood back. I’m very happy I had those years with the fandom and everyone on the SMP ❤️
I like how u added the tribute to techno and the end clip made me tear up man.. what a journey..
Cheese
I’m so happy to have lived in a time where I could experience this smp
Normally when people say this is there last video or the last video with there friends it’s click bate and I was hoping it was click bate but it wasn’t now I’m sad that there’s not gonna be videos on the Dream smp. We will miss the Dream smp bye Dream smp and R.I.P Technoblade u will be missed just as much as the Dream smp. I just wish that it wasn’t over.😢                                                                                    -Oliver-
when it to him in the sow I immediately knew I was gonna get emotional
53k views in 30 mins wow
Good riddance.
I dont deserv that
Wow this actually made me emotional, this was really great while it lasted. o7
Didn't this already come out?
so emotional
Great video. the ending was kind of nostalgic but nice wt the same time. During the end flight it would be nice to know what technoblade would do there. He would probably take the dragon egg and kill steak the dragon. Idk what I'm typing anymore now.
So sad to see the dream smp go, it's been a long and amazing 2-3 years, it will be in good memory
So, no season 2?
Thank you Sir, for everything :')
HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Rip DreamSMP.
So glad this fucking server is finally gone
I WAS HERE :((( o7 ALSO IM CRYING BC OF THE END THANK YOU FOR THE MEMORIES ALONG THE WAY! I LOVE YOU CHAT
As a huge fan who had started to watch since the beginning of dream smp, I can tell you how much joy I felt watching these videos. I’m pretty sure we all eventually got emotional when we watched this video, the dream smp series was honestly such a roller coaster of emotions, the number of plot twists, betrayals, beginnings, endings, wars won and lost in this series was incredibly well put that it became for a while, my favorite content on Youtube. One thing I know is that the dream smp has grown on me. I’ll always remember the excitement and joy I felt each time a new dream smp video was released, I’d stop everything and click on the notification as fast as I could. I want to thank everyone in the dream smp for making this series, especially to you Tommy. Rest in peace Technoblade, and to the dream SMP as well.
how much do you want to clickbait this Video? Tommy: yes.
R.i.P
Will there be a season 2? Of the DSMP
Technoblade never DIESSSS
It’s been a hell of a ride
The memories, it was more than i could ask for! RIP TechnoBlade, o7
Thank you so much for the past few years! You really help a lot of people by just playing on this smp💕 I will miss this era a lot but I’m also excited for all the new stuff that’s coming <3 o7
12:49 "ARE YOU READY? FOR THE GREATEST MLG OF ALL TIME"  Famous last words o7
Eeeeee
You cried in the exile stream when you fake killed yourself😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
"omg i can ban everyone" It took exactly four seconds for him to mad with power
o7 DreamSMP, we will never forget it  :(
2:45 ah yes, bottom text
thank you for giving it a proper ending it deserved <33 it was truly iconic
I don’t like the dream smp
Its been an pleasure to be a subscriber, a fan, and a fan of all the dsmp group. ❤❤❤

Hi
I wish Techno could’ve saw the end😢
Maaan I was never really into the streams but wow this hurts my heart, especially visiting Technoblade's old house
Great ending!
Cool
honestly, one of my favorite videos I've ever watched. The amount of memories I've had while watching this server is insane. While it is sad to see it go, I do appreciate all the content that was produced on it. Been here since the beginning :)
So sweet, couldn't have asked for a better sendoff
Stfu. Its too sad😭
Not at 13:10 we can hear the music from tommys actual dsmp streams when he was tormented by dream in lore lmao
😭
I’m crying rn. These years were the best years of my life❤ thanks
=)
The best SMP ever :) We're all proud of you tommy ♥
An End of an Era! Looking forward to what the future holds!
Rel
I will miss the dream smp
This was truly one of the funniest finale vids of all times. W Tommy.
OWO IM A FURDH 😼
kinda sad he missed out the pig in the tower :(
I am legit crying rn
Bro thinks he’s tommyinnit 💀💀💀
The techno part rly made me sad, he never got to log on one last time with everyone
The nostalgia hits hard
wait im so lost why is it ending?
the Dream smp videos were fun
bru wot
Ima miss the dream smp
I never thought I will cry at a tommyinnit video🤣😭
rip techno
Really thought I was past the point in my life where dream smp videos could bring me to tears. I'm so glad to be wrong about that.
I played on a realm called 505 for about a year. My last day on it was just like this video. It’s such a bittersweet feeling, knowing you can’t ever get the same feeling in that special place again. But the memories are still there, and there is now room for more to be made :)
I guess this the end and I want to thank Tommy and the whole dream smp for making this the best experience I ever had and thanks for making my days when I was sad,alone or losing hope I don’t know I would do without you and the whole community I will miss this and I can’t wait for what the future holds  PS:Technoblade never dies ❤🕊️
What's happening
good bye dream smp
I gotta be honest I haven’t watched any of the dsmp for like a year or two but the techno big hit hard
Thanks for all the memories! I remember rushing to catch your streams and then realize that I barely missed them.
Im happy this is the last episode. It was shit
did anyone else notice the "bottom text" subtitle at 2:45
Technoblade will see that from heaven.
I joined the dsmp fandom right at the end, and this video makes me sad and wish that I had joined it sooner, rest in dirt blocks Dream SMP <3
Goodbye DSMP, this journey has been absolutely amazing
Cool
This hit really hard,  I've been here since the first Dream SMP video went live and it's been amazing. Thank you for everything Tommy.. o7
😭😭😭😭
I'm not crying, you are :,)
Genuinely would never want Dream SMP to end Proof we're growing fast.... (It hurts so bad)
Dream SMP was honestly such an amazing moment in my life. Sucks that it's gone now. I'm honestly missing this so much right now.
hi
my favourite smp😢
Technoblade should’ve been here in the of the Dream SMP Technoblade never dies
i hope they start another smp BİGMANTOMMY İN SİDE OF İT SMP :d OW maybe the BLADESMP
14:45 just killed a gogy feeling good. 15:47 AH ! Im getting touched 16:15  The end?… 17:16 one last sunset…
Hay I would just like to say thank you for the video and goodbye dream SMP peace and love❤
yall are corny
Goodbye techno and dream smp u brought us content that made us happy ❤❤
Tommy an tubbo may not have here since day one. But it was them who shaped the server from a chill hangout zone for streamer’s. To an overarching story with many different plot points and perspectives. The only thing I wish was different is that techno got to be there for the ending.
aww this is really cute
Rip dream smp 2020-2023
Technoblade never dies🗿🗿🐷🐷
I just wish I could expirience all of this for the first time again. I laughed so much and was hooked on to the lore. Thank u all for this and Even If you dont cry I do it just like Tubbs. ❤️
see you later
I’m gonna miss the dream SMP ❤ the dream SMP was literally my whole childhood 😭 but I hope you guys are all happy, and I can’t wait to see future videos, but sadly not with the dream SMP
NOW WAY BRUH

That part where you showed Techno's house got me sad. Rest in peace king.
The end of an era. Damn i almost cried.

This was epic, rip dream smp o7 (imagine being the dragon tho, he saw who entered and was like: welp, I'm dead) edit: like if you cried (cuz i sure did)
This was so sad but great video 😢❤
okay this made me cry what the fuck tommy this is amazing
When I saw this I saved every single one of his vids
101 on how to make a DreamSMP cry their eyes out: *SHOW THEM THIS VIDEO THEY WILL BAWL*
Just like technoblade, dsmp will survive in our hearts
XD
That is... The best editing... I have ever seen... Thank you for these 2 years, Tommy
Lol funni tom

The Dream Smp made me the happiest I've ever felt in a long time. When I found out th ey disconnected I was sobbing. Full on ugly tears. Thank you, o7
O7
Rest In peace

I have been watching dream smp for 2 years, watching lore everytime it was released or streamed, I literally cried so much when you went to techno blade's base- I will support all of you forever, o7! ;-;
I’m honestly crying right now, 2 years of memories I will never forget 😢   R.I.P The Dream SMP  2020 - 2023  🌹🪦🌹 🟫🟫🟫 🟫🟫🟫 😭😩😞😔😕😪😮‍💨😥😩 🟫🟫🟫 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏  😔😪😭😩😞😪😞😖😫😏😪🤧 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

I will miss this forever. Another one of those wont come for an eternity...  goodbye, Love DSMP <3
RIP
the jschlatt music at the end was such a huge throwback
I got into dream smp like a week ago and i log onto youtube to freaking see THIS????
When Tommy went to Techno's home it hit hard. Rest In Peace man, you will be forever missed.
the server died with techno
Master manipulator lol
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
14:24 bad doesn't say language???
it’s weird seeing it gone, all the lore and everything, just gone. but it’s nice to see a new start without it!! o7
Ох, чёрт! Это было... Блять, я обожаю те чувства, которые мы все испытывали, пока смотрели наш любимый DRM SMP!! Спасибо, за незабываемые эмоции и то, что вы подарили нам 🕊️🤝
But why It finished?
good 2 yearss
The Dream SMP has actually been amazing to watch. Just remembering watching the Dream vs Tommy & Tubbo videos, Watching events, finale's live.... It was just so good.  I want to thank everyone who wrote and played in the Dream SMP for showing what can be possible in an online game with an online community if you use good storytelling and amazing people!  Also, R.I.P. Technoblade
I’ve been on the final stream on the beginning to the end of the stream
Techno's home needs to be saved as a historical landmark. I hope the server remains up to keep the history intact. TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
This is *Truly* the end of an era
I already did this once... I can't do this again!!!!
Rip dream smp😢 its sad for it to go
GG EZ.
Gosh it is an honor to be a part of the Dream SMP series for 2 years. We will miss you 💕
we are gonna miss you all, thanks for the good memories, the laugh you gave us and for being here. goodbye ❤❤
goodbye you legand.
RIP dream SMP, you got us through some tough times. ♥️
Goodbye dream smp you will always be remembered
Why is this your last Dream SMP video?
This is hit hard but we all knew it would happen sooner or later but we will always remember Dream SMP and or blood God Technoblade may they rest in peace 😢 well miss them but we won't forget, they're in are hearts forever   –MW
Damn RIP The Memories in the Dream SMP RIP the disk o7
Pls make more vids plssss pppllllssss
Can someone pls tell me y the r stopping I mean it was so good
Already have seen it in his stream
As a dsmp fan it was a great 2 years I'm going to miss this forever. we will never forget!
O7 Dreamsmp, thank you for the wonderful creators who have brought such great content into my life!
reminds me of the SMP Earth video... 💯💯
The visit to techno's house actually hit hard im not gonna lie
This really got me through 2020, and I'm sad to see it go, especially without the Blade. But the content was phenomenal, always, and I'm really glad they sent it off with Killing the Ender Dragon.  My favorite parts were Tommy destructional nature, Wilbur's sanity breach, Eret's Betrayal, Pretty much everything Technoblade related: He was a chaos bringer and always really funny (R.I.P), Ranboo's identity and memory crisis, Dream's villain arc (Some parts more than others) and, of course, PHILZA!!! LOOOK OUTTTTTT!!!!! Rip the server, gunna miss ya'll.
I’m gonna miss this… but I loved it and that’s all that matters but I’m on the verge of tears I’m gonna miss the dsmp but as it was going on my life was at it’s peak and I loved it. Thank you for all you’ve done Tommy and all of the other Dream SMP members. The memories I have of everyone will always be in my heart forever and ever. Thank you once more. Long live the Dsmp and forever it will be in our memories. <3 🥲👋🫶
o7 my childhood home

:(((((((
The dsmp had an impact on everyone, from it’s fans to it’s haters. The 2 years were amazing for every fan. May the smp and Techno rest. o7 guys.
Rest in peace dream SMP we will remember you😢😢
Tommy seems like the kind of person to see dsmp and say “is anyone gonna ban everyone” and not wait for an answer
I cant believe it...
very appreciated video
So sad to see it go.
2:45 thought you were slick with that bottom text
goodbye DreamSMP o7

2:45 bottom text
R.I.P Dream SMP
I wasn't a big dream smp viewer but the visit to technos residence really hit me in the feels especially because I'm currently wearing the memorial merchandise
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!!!!!!
Gone, but never forgotten, thanks to dream SMP :)

17:35 it's not fine
It's all fun and games until you realize that Technoblades builds are also gone
So are all the past videos gonna be deleted, cause I don't want them to go
Ok
this was amazeing and when tommy saw tubbo it was sooooooo funny
Tommy joined this smp and really said, "Peace was never an option". And it was awesome.
ahhh yess that was awesome man and im ganna miss it thanks for everything big man
Anyone else crying?🤧
Na bru u r liein
I got a shirt from techno and it never arrived nor did my money get returned so just be careful guys. I wanted to do it to remember him and to help donate but the company scammed me. (if you guys have any suggestions I'd appreciate them)
the end of a trilogy
Goodbye dream smp
Thank you so much for all the great memories and making a lot of people lives a lot better. :D
Tbh i cried during this vid
Tommy the dsmp came into my life when I wasn't going through a good place  But tell will this Two years ago I was on omegle then I saw will but the background was different we exchanged hellos, then he said " Tommy are we the bad guys " I shuddered a no he laughed before leaving that chat thing  Now I'm a c¡tommy and c¡Phil of most servers I joined and I have about 3 sons   So I believe he cursed me with them, but thanks for all the great memories of the dsmp it will always live in my heart forever
I would have loved to see Technoblade on..... but TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
I know the dream smp is over, but I also know that the majority of pufferfish species are toxic and some are among the most poisonous vertebrates in the world. In certain species, the internal organs, such as the liver, and sometimes the skin, contain tetrodotoxin, and are highly toxic to most animals when eaten.
Fuck, man
Seeing Tommy go to techno's house and laugh it off like it was nothing gave me chills
April fool's right please 😢😢😢
RIP Dream Smp.......
hehe
I don't have a long message, an important memory, but just a lot of joy. Goobye Dream SMP.
Meow.
This made me cry
Bro i started crying when you went to tehno's house

The Emotions, especially in Techno's house. The dragon fight made me so happy, just shows how friends playing MC should be, chaos and pure joy. Thanks Dream SMP!
16:06 tubooooo
The transitions through Tommy's time one the SMP were absolutely everything.  Thank you, Tommyinnit. And thank you Dream. God that's weird to say. And thank you to everyone else on the Dream SMP.   For giving people a (very chaotic) place to call home.
Rest in pace
2:45  " bottom text"

Rest in peace dream SMP, techno blade, etc😭😭. I will now for ever cry about this. For the past 2 years it was amazing watching everyone, now its just sad seeing it end like this😭
As the saying goes: “All good things must come to an end eventually.”   Watching this server has been an absolute pleasure and got so many people through the hard times of their lives and through COVID, and made countless people happy. It has created a fandom of talented artists, writers and fans, and has brought together many streamers and fans across the world. Watching the DSMP has been an absolute blast, and I hope the memory of this server lives on.   Rest In Peace, Technoblade.
2:45 exposed

The callback to Schlatt beating the ender dragon on SMPlive with the music honestly made me tear up a bit. Stopped watching a while back but the Dream SMP will always be part of my childhood.

Never forgotten
cool i hope you start another series
Tommy
This made me cry😢
Those who watched since the beginning: It's an unfortunate truth that the things that bring us the most happiness, the moments that feel like they'll last forever, are often the ones that are most fleeting. We can become so consumed by joy that we forget to prepare ourselves for the inevitable end.  But when that end does come, it can be devastating. It feels like a piece of ourselves has been taken away, like we've lost a part of our identity. We mourn the loss of what once was, and we grieve for what we know can never be again.  The pain is real, and it cuts deep. It can be hard to see past the darkness and remember that life is full of new experiences and new joys waiting to be discovered. We may feel lost, adrift in a sea of uncertainty and sorrow.  But it's important to remember that even in our darkest moments, we are never truly alone. There are people around us who care, who want to see us happy again. And even though it may feel like the end of the world, there is always hope for a new beginning.  So as we mourn the loss of what once was, let us also look forward to what can be. Let us embrace the uncertainty of the future and hold onto the memories of the past. And let us never forget that, even when good things come to an end, the journey is always worth it. 😊
That's crazy, I've been here almost since the beginning and seeing it end is mind blowing. There was so many memories that I hold dear to my heart and so many times I've cried but I'm glad I was apart of it

I genuinely started crying at the end. Thank you for everything dsmp <33

Nearly enjoyed this until i saw the groomer involved :/
I cried 3 times omg.  This entire series changed my entire life.   Brought me and my best friend together more and more. And when techno passed away, it broke both of our hearts. But we agreed we would never forget this series and how much it means to us
Oh my god that transition

Goodbye Dream SMP You will be missed very much
These streams and videos, this history, this adventure... Will never be forgotten
I've never seen any dream smp videos could someone quickly summarize what happened?
I was worried my phone speakers were about to blow
Makes sense tommy finishes dream smp off. He was always kinda the main guy. Truly an end of an era
Wait why is he leaving?

I remember watching the first video of the dream smp, confused, not knowing how much I'll miss it when it was gone, j never knew it would go, I didn't want it to go, I loved it, whenever I seen a new video or stream I'd forget about everything that could have happened in school, and even online, thank you dsmp, we will miss you 🐷💙👑 o7
aside from the nostalgia, at 2:45 it just says 'bottom text' 🤔
this is so bittersweet
How nearly cried at the techno bit?
Is this really the last one ever
Dude watching the technoblade part is making me cry
It was a honour watching and following the story of the Dream SMP for 2 years. o7
I started to cry when you went inside technos house.
"Jessus niki i have a girlfriend"  Classic line
Bro thank god it's over.
I cried so hard when he visited techno’s house ❤❤❤

Thank to the dream smp! I made so many friends talking about them! And watching it every day laughing so hard. Some of my best memories✨

You along with all the others of the Dream SMP have always made my day when you all play. I'm going to miss it, but I truly enjoyed it.

Good luck on your future endeavors, and hopefully, I'll stay around for that! This has been a crazy journey. Goodbye, Dream SMP.
I genuinely loved the DSMP. It helped me personally and a lot more people and was just a great thing to follow while the lockdown was going on. But to be honest, I'm kinda thankful that there isn't a season 2. It wouldn't have been the same as the first one. But still, I'm never going to forget this silly little server and I'll still be able to tell you the lore in 10 years :')
Nice
Dream smp was a bkast

Hi
Thank you, Tommy. You MADE the SMP, and were one of the greatest parts of it. o7 TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!
POV: You were one of the chatters that said "I was here"
Final episode of the adventure...
I want to go to the 2019 and re watch everything
It was real good while it lasted, "I'm an atheist, but if god sends me to hell I want him to hesitate"- Techno W server and W lore, what a journey it was🐐🐐
Hi
.
It was really cool watching your vids since your first day on that server and how much you grew, the dsmp really made my year during quarantine. It’s been an honor going on the journey through the dsmp streams and all the people who reacted to all of your adventures positively. It’s sad that it had to end, but it was an amazing journey.
1st
I love how they don’t even have stacked gear after 2.3 years
Here lies Dream SMP 😢
yippeee
It's very sad to see it go, but let's hope the next will slightly match it.
This brings back so much nostalgia 🤭😔
Hi
