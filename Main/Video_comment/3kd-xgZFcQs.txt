Thank you, Dom, <3 This 53-year-old Gen X mom found you through her 28-year-old daughter, this song makes me smile when I have my depression days which are most.
Who came back here in 2025? Have a good life person with good taste!
Nice song !

I tried to fight for C. Weber, but I failed miserably, and now I'm just going to leave. 10/27/27 The end
I don't get the popularity at all.
Its interesting Ozzy, a member of perhaps the most influential and inventive rock band ever,  would be so enamored with mundane formula rock.
Where my OG's at?!!!! Since 2018
I know all the words to this
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Same beat with jealous by eyedress right??
I'm sad today, too much bad news, a very unstable life, and all the job vacancies I applied for just ghosted me. There was one left I went through the entire month of test, another assigments, interviews, only to end up failing. I feel like a loser with high self confidence... but at least I still have self confidence, right?  Your song makes me feel a little happier, at least for tonight :")
Here in 2025 anybody!?😅
Come on Ozzy didnt pass any torch to this man but praise because hes young and talented but pretty much a pop singer
Im feeling like an old cougar ......but aim so relating to Doms lyrics.....
💯👍
🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈
This song never fails to bring mood up and motivate me to finish the day❤️
I’m 60 and did not want to like this guy but damn!! ❤️❤️He is a fabulous performer and obviously loves what he does wish him a great career!
[Verse 1] Why are we sitting in silence? Wondering how we can beat all the violence I've been asking for some kind of guidance ’Cause some things in life you just simply can't finance And your mother, she told me to ride it But I think I'm too late and I’m sinking now And I need somebody to pull me out  [Chorus] I don't wanna go out today I wanna lie in my bed so that I run away From what the internet says, all the playground games Don't feel like feelin' sad today I don't wanna go out tonight I wanna be right here, right by your side While all the people are cruel, you'rе an hour away Don't feel like feelin' sad today  [Verse 2] Better pull mysеlf together How long does it take to figure it out? The politician ain’t gonna help you He’s only gonna try and take your house 'Cause that’s the thing I know 'bout the mornings They're coming and there ain't no way out Like a hammer in a murderer’s courtroom Gravity gonna bring you down  [Chorus] So I don't wanna go out today I wanna lie in my bed so that I run away From what the internet says, all the playground games Don't feel like feelin' sad today I don't wanna go out tonight I wanna be right here, right by your side While all the people are cruel, you're an hour away Don't feel like feelin' sad today  [Outro] Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh, oh) Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh, oh) I don't feel like feelin' sad today Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh, oh) Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh, oh) I don't feel like feelin' sad today
I love you
he looks so happy i love it
“Your mother she told me to ride it” huh? “I wanna lie in my bed so that I run away” What? Wtf are these lyrics?
This song IS summer 🖤
I love you
C
I really admire him!
Anyone 2025 or am I the only one??
This will banger will be plaing wen i die
Best  musician

Wow amazing 🎉
Get up
I like this kid SO MUCH right now. I'm so scared it's gonna come out that it's all fake. This is the first new music for me since I found Ghost. Please don't let this go wrong.
I love you ❤
Thank you for being a beakon of light in a dark and ugly world. For bringing joy and love into the world. Love u Dom
I love how all Dom wants to do is make a safe space for everyone and the fact that he isn't as popular as Talor swift still suppresses me I love him and all of his music and Oc his personality is through the roof.
WE MUST PROTECT THIS MAN FROM EVERYONE THAT WANTS TO HURT HIM. WHOS WITH ME?👇
🤘❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🤘🤘🤘
ปืนฉีดน้ำไทย❤️❤️
i absolutely wish i’d been there first this is looks so much fuckin fun but aaaaaa
I'm going to disregard the community guidelines and say fuck
I mean I’m not even a fan but thi shit do be 🔥🔥
🖤
500 days ago i was under the london eye with all these beautiful people , i miss it every day . thank you dom for giving me a family
This is a real rockstar… why am I jusst now finding dude. And we same age ! ROCKSTAR! Keep it up bro! Love from LA
As someone who has had a really really rough week making me want to give up on it all, this song is actually a spark of hope, this is why I love music cause I certainly would not be here today without it
I love you bro you helping people find themselves
is it just me or does he wear pink socks in most of his videos.
I think one of the best music vids 🖤🩶🖤
My brother got invited there but he couldn't go :(
THIS MAN IS THE REASON I AM HAPPY NOW!!!!!
Simplemente perfección
So young yet so open minded! I'm 53 & yet shit still happens. But I'm strong & so far have been holding on! 😍 No Smokes, No Drugs & barely Drink yet have a look many reasons to do otherwise!
https://youtu.be/G_p0EU8f6XY
https://youtu.be/V7AQ4Nor2Wg
This is incredible. I've never related to a song so much and yet it still manages to keep me upbeat. Love it
Niehkkker
Love you yungblud
This gives me pride vibes so...  *HAPPY PRIDE MONTH 2023 EVERYONE!!!!* ❤🧡💛💚💙💜 This song got me into a really good mood so here I am trying to spread some love to y'all. I just want you to know that no matter what anyone says, you're perfect the way you are and I and so many other people out there love you no matter what you identify as. Please don't let the homophobes and transphobes and all the other assholes get you down. And I know it can be hard, but you're strong and it'll get better, I promise. You have a community here that loves and accepts you exactly the way you are (not even talking only about being queer anymore). And if you're in Tennessee or Florida or literally any other place that makes it illegal to be yourself, know that we're all rooting for you and wish you only the best. You can get through it and I love you and remember you're not alone out there. I hope this helps someone 🖤🖤🖤
Thanks mate youve made me feel like the happiest kid alive
Has anyone noticed the same chain with a lock around his neck? Also, I wanna know where he got it.
I love you dom🖤
Yungblud has grown damn. Political lyrics in there he really is an anarchist😉. All his new stuff is so much more expressive than some of his previous generic sounding pop. Arrangements are better and finally keep pace with his amazing vocals, energy and lyrics. Killing it.🥰
Honestly this song gives me such good vibes
I like it❤
❤❤❤
I just think he's so fucking cute envy who he is with ❤
Yungblud's music is unmatched
Malísimo, es igual o parecido al video de ABRIL LAVIGNE , .... !!!
🫶
Dude this is amazing!!!!! If you ever stop making music then the world will be a sadder place
Thought it was jade goody for a second
See you soon in France ! Love you xx 🇫🇷🖤❤️
the fact that i’m in this video is insane to me
I truly don't hear The Cure song. What am I missing?
Wait this is popular? He sounds like he is having old teeth retainer and holes between the teeth. The lyrics are just random words, politician take your house, you are a hour away, social media what? I mean if you like it ok that's cool no judgements but death metal has more sense than this, whatever it was. It's like they ware drunk in the studio and said hey lets make a song before we pass out..give me a beat i would say randon words and you record it than just add guitar fill over it some punk rock repetitive shit and we are all set.
I'm approaching 33 and Yunglud makes it all sound like it's 2003 again. Always releasing great stuff.
DON’T FEEL LIKE FEELING SAD TODAY🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕

He's so sweet. You can tell he's just a genuinely kind person.
🖤🖤🖤I feel this song !!
i love u
Yungblud had this summer hit with this song and didn't play it at Chicago's Riot Fest...instead he played a 10 minute version of Fleabag. He could have played this song and an 8 minute version of Fleatbag...and then dropped the mic like an arrogant rapist.
love u yungblud S2
Cute!
I have never in all my life wanted to bounce my phone off a wall until I witnessed the 5 gum with this pure junk of a crybaby worried about what a internet troll has said lmfao I have never in all my life never ever heard such horrible junk as this it is literally making my ears bleed as I write this comment
Watching him in his videos never fails to make me smile. He always looks like he's having so much fun!
Кто тоже через впн?)
I LOVE THISSSSSSSS <33333333333333 it make's me feel joy and that i can do anything in life and no one can put me down
YaAaaas
I am going to his concert in Nashville and I am getting in the front row and I really hope that he pulls me onstage or gives me a hug or some shit...I fucking love Dom and everything that he does as a person. He genuinely cares about people and it warms my heart...I see how he hugs his fans when he meets them and I want Dom to hug me like that ya know! Love ya YUNGBLUD
This kid is pure energy and expressive on performence. Live the music truly pure feel!
I love this video song 😎✨
i did not know where i was in life until i found him so thank you i am making my self happy

Volvi a soñar con Dom,vi por primera estando en un concierto

Hello young blood just saying I love your music and I am such a big fan I love how you work soo hard and go crazy like me I love you 😍😍😍😍
I was a little shy to meet Dom in London east rough trade as I am an older fan … he was so genuine and it felt ok to be an older fan… thank you so much 💕
Who is why, is not the way, we end up.
I feel loved
Such a huge inspiration for me bro! Thank you so much for existing!
Blink 182 + Sum 41 + Green day+ Offspring =YUNGBLUD

When did you start with the early 00's Avril Lavigne rip off type music? 🤔 Dear lord, that was bloody painful to listen too 😬😒 Get back to the kind of music you're known and loved for, pls, for the love of fucking god! 🙏
Morningx
고마워 민익아
🔥🔥🔥
We need yungblud  and mgk music!!!!
❤️😍😍😍
Now this is the way, you really have a purpose for this earth. Appreciate this song appreciate you for making a change. Smart mindset.
Dom is an amazing singer  I love how he cares about the fans  I can’t wait to go to one of his gigs as I’ve been saving and saving to go   I’ve always been a big fan since Dom started YouTube  Love the songs and the meanings great vocals and great singer  Xxx❤️
I’ll love Dom forever, he saved me 🖤🖤🖤
Another song to momentarily cure my depression, thank you :) 🖤🖤🖤
I always get transported back to my emo outcast high school days when I listen to YUNGBLUD🥰  LGBTQ+ Pride for the win💖🏳️‍🌈✨
I feel like this guy could be my older brother... then I remember that I already have one and he's THE SAME AGE as him. OMG, he's so relatable in so many senses!! I'm autistic, so I've gone through many similar situations to him in my life. From being bullied at school to others pointing me out when simply taking a walk just because of my alt style or my "different" way of thinking (eg.: all those stereotypes involving any social communities/groups, genders or gender roles). Then, with time, I learned that it was actually okay to be the black sheep... or that maybe I'm, in fact, NOT SO DIFFERENT to the rest, since every day I see more and more people talking about stuggling with similar (if not the same!) things I do, and similar personalities to mine. Yay, such a relief... 💁🏻‍♀
How could U not LOVE this cutie... So lovable he is!
My dream is to meet him and go to a concert but I know it won't happen but a girl can dream thank u dom for helping us all we need more people like u. Ur saving life's everyday.
Dom do be livin a dream tho
2000s is back.
This is the most amazing piece of art I have ever seen 🖤
❤
I Hope He Releases The Prelude Track During The Quarantine Sessions .
From a (what they call) senior emo/someone who lived through the All American Rejects era I’m obsessed 🥰😍

6/10
He  can't  sing
This kid is remarkable. Speaking directly to the people who need so desperately to hear the message he has to give. Music can be so powerful, and when you are a frightened struggling kid, someone like him can change everything.I have used music all my life, to feel a connection, to not feel alone, to feel joy, express myself. I still do that, at 59 years old. This is raw talent, unbridled joy, and an outstretched hand.  And his music and songwriting are fuckin  brilliant. ♥️😊
thinking about the weird! video and this now. thank god time has passed.
London Underground, London Underground 🤔

I hope this song encourages you to still try an have fun and live life as free as you can while still acknowledging the horrors of today and fighting for change.

Don't feel like feeling sad today :)))))<333
I started following and listening to Yungblud just before the pandemic broke out, when I discovered that one of the most important people in my life would be gone in a matter of months. I was sad, empty, angry I discovered Yungblud around the time I started getting lost. I will never be grateful enough to Dominic for understanding me and accompanying me from dark to light these three years 🖤🖤
Is this the guy that spit in his hair
Best one since loner for me, I'm probably at a different stage of life than this guys usual audience but every now and again he still drops a banger or two that feels like it's just right for me :)
Wow to think I was there then watching the video back after just makes it even more better then it was, What a crowd what a day, absolute madness, Big up YungBlud all day long !! 🎉🙌🤩🧡🎶🎶
I first listened to yungblud at one of the lowest points in my life. very suicidal deppressed extreme anxiety an eating disorder and failing all my classes dom gave me another chance it felt like someone understood and the community was amazing .    bhc🖤 will forever have my heart    Thank you dom and all of you guys
Ok yeah here’s the thing. There’s one issue with this song. And it’s a big one. ITS DOESNT LAST LONG ENOUGH! IT WAS OVER BEFORE I KNEW IT AND I WAS LIKE WHO CUT HIM OFF?!  Another fckn piece of art. Gonna have to loop this one 😂😂🖤🖤🖤
I have always felt very ashamed of the H in my ADHD, until I found Yungblud, he makes me feel proud of my hyperactivity with each song, each word, each melody. I will be grateful all my life 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
His face is huge, and also have some issues with pronunciation of the letter S. Despite all off those problems song by itself is pretty fucking shit
Bro I was literally on the London Eye trying to find where the screaming was coming from. I didn't know I was this close to a fucking legend.😭😭
Lovee🖤
I looked at this song yesterday afternoon when my 2yo girl asked me to put some music. We found out that this song was out and we put it right away. We were both so excited, we danced on it and it was so fun. Thanks Dom for making more special moment with my little one. Things like that are so precious. And I hope that you know that YOU're precious to everyone 🖤
0:15 "why are we sh%#ing in silence"? man, couldn't they pick it up on the recording session and tell'im to try and not lisp on this one ...
He understands how to be happy in life🖤🖤🖤
I only found YUNGBLUD last year when I stumbled upon the parents music video and I loved but was so wildly confused at the same time. I was in such a dark place. My self harm was through the roof, I didn’t understand what it meant to live anymore, and I was so close to ending it all. But listening to Dom’s music reminded me what it was like to feel. Every time I listened to any of his music all my numbness drifted away. Anger, happiness, confusion, and even sadness were all back. I felt so heard and understood and I’m forever grateful for all of that. Because of music like this I’m able to get out of bed and resist the temptation of picking up a knife once again. Because of this, I’ve accepted my sexuality, have a great girlfriend, and am rocking the most unnatural colored hair possible! But my mental health journey is far from over. If there’s anyone who’s in the place I used to be, know that all those forgotten feelings will return at some point. Never stop being yourself, and as cheesy as it sounds, people do care about you and want you to express your identity. Be yourself and kick some fucking ass! 🖤🖤
Sounds like he needs to spit really bad lol not a bad jam tho
Healing from a third degree sunburn right now and this brought an instant smile to my face and I completely forgot about the sunburn and pain from it. I love it!🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤

Thank you for coming to greece yesterday we had an awesome time i hope u come again for a solo concert
I fuckin love it
Waited for a Song like this, so proud of u🙏🏻❤️‍🔥
Gen z be like, Don't Feel Like Being Sad Today... But us Millennials be screamin IM NOT SAD ANYMORE IM JUST TIRED OF THIS PLACE
Hearing this song revived my attitude to forget judgement and put myself out there, regardless of what eyes turn on me.  A little over a year ago, my mom expressed she wanted to send me to the military when she found out I’m bisexual. Luckily, I had just turned 18 so I dodged that threat. But there’s no doubt that the intent and phobia was there, and I can’t forgive it most days.   My attitude has been to not give a fuck because, if your own mother can’t accept you and would even willfully try to send you in the way of danger, and since that has strengthened me and I lived, why should I have fear?  Anyway, this new song gave me that attitude back and I ended up confessing I had a crush on my crush, to my crush of 8 months last night. She was flattered but said she isn’t looking for anyone because moving away. That she hopes it doesn’t make anything bad between us since she had to reject me, which it didn’t, because I don’t feel like feeling sad today and I take it in fucking stride. I was expecting it to go nowhere from the moment I even considered saying anything, but it got it off my chest. So I don’t have that holding me down. This new song reminded me to take that attitude back
Toooo short of a song m8… ‘Lincoln 2022’   Ily 🤟 ♥️
I LOVE YOU 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
I look at him (always) 😭😻

My ex girlfriend, mother to my child introduced me to to yungblud, I love him but god my heart hurts when I hear his music.  Miss the singing along to his songs while we cleaned our house 🙁
Fuck, forgot this was coming out until today. A day late and many, many dollars short as usual. Well, better than when I was oblivious to your existence... this is a wonderful little slice of joy, saying fuck everyone who wants to hold you down, you don't need to give them the space or time! Love it, let's all try to live it! 🖤🖤🖤

I really like the work of Dominik, it makes me feel better when I listen to his songs, the feeling that everything will work out and this world is not so bad.🖤🇺🇦
This song is how I feel on a Friday at 2:59pm ;)
I love you so so much Dom! <3
I love it so much! Dom your music brings so much joy and happiness! 🖤🖤
Well, I rarely listen to Yungblud, because besides pop-punk I rather listen to metalcore, post-hardcore and alternative metal, but nevertheless I like his music a lot.   It's a great song. Super. 👏🙂  I don't know exactly what it is, but somehow Dominic has "it". 😅  Probably it's the passion he brings to the table and addresses things that are on his mind and on the minds of a large part of his community.   In some way his songs cheer you up and make you feel better.   I discovered "Parents" when I was writing a performance piece for my degree and tomorrow I have to turn another one in.   I'm already a little scared because the lecturer is very strict and sometimes very demanding.   I hope very much that I can somehow manage it...😔
I feel you
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
🖤🖤🖤
I love  this song so much you are amazing Dom. Don't stop what your doing you are amazing
Unbelievable 🤘🤘🤘
Well done yungblud
I love you!!!! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤

🖤🖤🖤
Dom, you have helped me through depression, it may still be there but you helped me through it. My mom hates yungblud so much because she is homophobic. I have been listening to his music for so long it’s hard to keep count. I remember one time I asked my mom if she could take me to one of his concerts or shows if they were near and she said no, I asked her why she could take me to go see all these other people like slipknot or korn or Alice In Chains and people like that and her response was “I’m not taking you to go see some f****t like him” that killed me.
The best song I've ever heard
🖤🖤🖤
ok
I love it I love all your music
The fact that I was there makes this song and music video 100 times better. Love you Dom 🖤🖤🖤
Classic this was unreal 🫶🏻🖤
Yeah
I absolutely love the new song🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
😊 Looks like you’re having a great time. I’ll play this with you on 7/19/23 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin Dom. Then I’ll be releasing my first rock record that night! I’m recording with my friends Olivia, Gabriella, and Selena 7/19/22! Me and H.E.R. are writing the music and Sel and Liv are writing lyrics for me!

Someday imma sing with yungblud and make music with him
I was really looking forward to hearing this (and other songs ofc) live in Hungary, before it got officially released, but unfortunately you couldn't make it that day. Just wanna say it here, since I didn't get to shout it from the front row, the song is really really awesome!!🖤🖤  Hope I'll get to see you live some other time😊🖤
I love it so much
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING<333
This song is amazing it's really helping me with the death of my cat R.I.P Marley 💔
king 👑 aprecciate ya man!

Just waking up with this and feeling much better. Thank u, Dom 🖤

I was lucky enough to be there for the video shoot and I can honestly say it was amazing to see how yungblud brought all those people together and much he inspires people we love you dom🖤🖤🖤
Totally love it so jealous I couldn't make it with the trains going on strike but never mind. Love the energy an love that yungblud brings to all his fans

Thank You for your music and bringing happiness and understanding into my everyday life ❤ I look forward to seeing you live on the 27th of July and feel genuine happiness for the first time in a long time. I love you dom 🖤
Goosebumps... The best! I'm so excited🖤☠️🖤💋🧷✨  it's so gorgeous😻😻🥵
i fucking love him
This song is going on my playlist so no matter how I'm feeling i can play this song. My depression and anxiety have been at it's worst lately and Dom's music always makes me feel better people make fun of me because I'm older and listen to YB music I'm 44 and i don't care what anyone says I'll be a yungblud fan and part of the BHC till I'm no longer here. YungBlud makes life worth living I've had suicidal thoughts and attempts but because of yb I'm still here so thank you YB for all you do you're amazing and we love you BHC forever
My happiness after watching this 📈📈📈

Even though life is rough, we have our best mate YungBlud to give us all the comfort we need for each and every one of us to be ourselves ♥️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎 °he gives me the strength to move forward so bless him for that🍞🍞°
Just woke up, and one of the first thing i did was listening to that amazing song, that gave me my first smile of the day, thanks dom🖤 . I can not wait to have the whole album and blast it 🤘
Your songs brighten my day thank you 😊 🙏
i’m so fookin proud of you🖤🩸 ilysm dom! THAT’S SO MADDD😍😍😍🖤🖤🖤🖤
I discovered Yungblud two years ago when I was at my lowest. School stressed me out, there was too much pressure on my brain, I felt empty, irrelevant, alone, I didn't see a reason to keep on fighting. My life seemed so fooking worthless. But all his songs are giving me the feeling, that everything will be alright. This spring I had a though time writing my finals, but Dom just pushed me through. I even saw him live on stage during this time and he gave me so much energy. I've never felt more alive, more understood, for such a long time. So thank you for saving me. I wouldn't have made it without you, without your music, without all these lovely people.🖤
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
FOUR HOURS
Love this song so much
I liked a friend but my actions made me lose them. Been depressed  sense febuary, just heartbroken and just been burnt out. But i dont wanna be sad forever, I want to go out and hangout with friends before I move, i just want to go out and hurry to heal this emotional wound I have. I would want to have fun instead of just in my bedroom in a dim lit room
YUNGBLUD YOU DID IT AGAIN I FUCKIN LOVE YOU.
This the type of song that will make happy even when you haveing the worst day posable. Thank you so much YUNGBLUD for bring this amazing joy and happiness to me.

.TW.  Dom saved my life. Just under a year on july 21st my I lost my best friend to suicide, YUNGBLUD was our thing and listening to him after I lost Ethan was bitter sweet and I hated the fact that I still loved dom. About three months later I was on Spotify and one of his songs popped up in my recommended for the first time since I lost Ethan. It was Mars. I felt like I was losing myself. He made me see myself again, clearly. Without you Dom I wouldn't here, I wouldn't have an amazing partner and I wouldn't have found my passion for music again. You are my hero. And I have you to thank for everything good that's happened in this past 9 months.
I just love you and your music. I always listen to your songs and try to sing them in English. Actually i'm japanese who can't speak English well. However your music can be enjoyed whether it can or not! I'm so happy for the new song. Tysm Dom🖤🖤
Love. This.
I was literally in the middle of a panic attack before I saw that this came out. Thank goodness for you ❤
I luv ya Dom!! I cannot wait till your new album gets released!! Preordered it so I can’t wait!! I luv ya soo much! I went to your concert back in March and I loved it! I love seeing you on stage and rocking it! Being Bi and having negative thoughts like 24/7 and tend to feel bad about myself, you always get me dancing and cheering me up and I love the way your not afraid to express yourself and how we’re all one community with you and are all supported by you!! Love being apart of the black hearts club and I love you Dom!! Keep bringing us joy, support, and love!! Love ya Dom!! 🖤🖤🖤🖤
crazy this song/video dropping at the most lowest point of my life being left by my so called significant other for absolutely no reason at all I thank you for this yungblud we love *TF* outta yuh
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Your truly a blessing I fookin love you so much!! 🖤 also lil Chris vibes
LOVE IT. LOVE U DOM 🥺🖤🖤🖤
Once again, a song that's gonna mean a lot to a whole bunch of people. I think alot of people would agree when I say that your the reason that they are still alive, ur music means so much to us Dom NEVER stop doing what you love. You have helped us so much. Thank you Dom 🖤  #BHC #YUNGBLUD #DFLFST
I love him so much 🖤
Okaay, cute! I was feeling sad and then... hello music video!! This is the song I needed to hear too! 🖤🖤🖤🖤 Thank you, Dom! And the band! 🙌

As expected....a banger🔥
LYRICS 🖤  Why are we sitting in silence? Wondering how we can beat all the violence I’ve been asking for some kind of guidance ‘Cause some things in life you just simply can’t finance And your mother, she told me to ride it But I think I’m too late and I’m sinking now And I need somebody to pull me out  I don’t wanna go out today I wanna lie in my bed so that I run away From what the internet says, all the playground games Don’t feel like feeling sad today I don’t wanna go out tonight I wanna be right here, right by your side While other people are cruel, you’re an hour away Don’t feel like feeling sad today   Better pull myself together How long does it take to figure it out? The politician ain’t gonna help you He’s only gonna try and take your house ‘Cause that’s the thing I know by the mornings They’re coming and there ain’t no way out Like a hammer in a murderer’s courtroom Gravity gonna bring you down  So I don’t wanna go out today I wanna lie in my bed so that I run away From what the internet says, all the playground games Don’t feel like feeling sad today I don’t wanna go out tonight I wanna be right here, right by your side While other people are cruel, you’re an hour away Don’t feel like feeling sad today  Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh, oh) Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh, oh) I don’t feel like feeling sad today Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh, oh) Oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh, oh) I don’t feel like feeling sad today
❤🧡💛💚💙💜🖤
I will fucking love you ❤
There is so much love in this army 🖤🖤🖤🩸
You are fucking incredible. Miss you so much man🖤🖤

So maybe I'm just emotional but this legit made me cry, not because it made me sad but because it made me so beyond fucking happy to see our family, all together, having such an amazing time!!! I couldn't be there but still seeing everyone together having a blast and being happy is such a beautiful thing! I am so thankful for Dom and for this family every single day, before the BHC I was so fucking lost and in such a dark hole I didn't know how to climb out of. Now that I have this beautiful family I have people who I can lean on always, people who truly are MY FAMILY, people I love more than anything in this world. I can honestly be 100% myself and not be afraid, I don't have to chip parts away and hide anymore, and that's such an amazing feeling. Dom, thank you so much for everything, you have saved not only me but so many of us with your words, your music, and this family and I love you so much for that! I am so proud of you. The BHC has my whole heart, forever and always🖤🖤🖤

Yuuup!
I have my first ever job interview tomorrow, you always help hype me up and calm my nerves. Just from the clips I can tell it's gonna be fuckin INSANE. Honestly a bit envious of those who get to hear this live.  Forever grateful for you and the BHC <3 UPDATE: The power of Dom never fails! My interview went great!! The shift lead said he's 99% sure I got it but the manager will be the one to decide that. Fingers crossed still!!!
Excited isn’t the word.. so glad this dropped when I was doing an overnight at work so I could watch it 🖤🖤🖤
XD
Every damn melody, word, minute of the video is healing me. Thank you for sharing your essence Dom🖤💐
I love you Dom 🖤
