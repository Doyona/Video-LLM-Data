Good game boys
Capitals @ Maple Leafs
The Rock The Red era is ...over.  The Caps should get rid of some of the older guys and get some youth.  I get it's hard to do because you are thinking still about surrounding Ovechkin with talent.....but you can't have the quest for Gretzky cloud the ultimate goal of ...long term winning!!   Gonna be a long year for Washington.
What a game played by the Leafs! Samsonov played amazing! Go Leafs Go!
Wow bad goaltending
To watch Alex Ovechkin, Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner play on the same rink would be an out of body experience.  God bless you if you were there.
they still playing that stupid song after scoring🙄
0:53 that would've been amazing
Thank god these 10 min highlights exists its the only way I now watch the leafs, can no longer watch the full game just have no patience.
Great win by leafs GO LEAFS GO🎉🇨🇦
0:50 ALMOST goal of the year. Absolutely filthy. Season is still young. This dude's gonna light it up.
The boards are such a distraction for me. I can’t stop looking at them.
As a Great Eight fan this is painful to watch. He's just a shell of his former self, can't see him scoring more than 20 goals this season.
Go leafs go
These ads on the boards are distracting. I don't think my eyes will ever get used to them.
Glad to see that the white flashing/glitching of the whole screen along with the digital board ads jumping around made the highlights and wasn’t just on my feed.
Stanley Cup Go Leafs Go
Ovechkin you’re too old😂 Just stop playing
still no playoff series win for the leafs!
Thanks to Washington’s goalie lol
My dad was at this game
There is nothing I love more then watching the Ovechkin Capitals lose.
When the Leafs win, hockey loses
Lets go Leafs!
First win for the Leafs of the season awesome
waw
Thank you for the few hockey highlights tossed in among the ads!
First game loss: "Fire Dubas! Fire Keefe! Dump Holl and Muzzin! Somebody buy  Murry a glove hand! Fire Shanahan! Trade the over the hill overpaid Tavaras!  Did Marner and Mathews even show up for this game? Tear this under producing overpaid team apart and build it right!!" 2nd game win: "Great win boys! Start planning the parade!!"
Please get rid of the Hall and Oates song
Samsonov bad performance
That open ice hit by Orlov though
Leafs play with some intensity and speed
holy jumpin engvall got smoked lol
The Maple Leafs 'got it done'!
Leafs winning. Joyous night
Never seen so many ads in a ten minute video
Stanley Cup here we come 🏆
Calle Jarnkrok is EVERYWHERE. Lovin' that.
Thank you for fixing the audio and picture timing
As a neutral Leafs were on the puck to (usually say on the ball). Showed they could play to.
BRING BACK SIMMONDS!
Why are all the advertisements on the boards blocked out from the broadcast camera view?
Good first win bounce back on a back to back. Let the first game be an outlier not the trend. Go leafs go.
After all those great chances for the Leafs in the third, they score on that kind of weird goal. Hockey is odd sometimes, but I'll take the win. 👍
The leafs played so well Sammy played so well huge dubs boys
Laffs get lucky
