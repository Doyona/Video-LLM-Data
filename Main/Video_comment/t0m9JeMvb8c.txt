jesus.. I enjoy playing games after smoking some weed.  this randomizer is NOT for me 🤣🤣
gg
all this does is make me remember how amazing hg/ss was wow
20:14 I love the nonchalant "yo we found Lance!" lmao
L
the poor Suicune been waiting there for hours lol
And that was his 8 hour workday 😅
To many jumpcuts this sucked but then again I don't see u snapping at random chatters in ur feed for questions eh I can deal with it
“I’d bring vaporeon cause it can learn surf” not by level up tho. So you’re assuming you have the HM for surf as well. Slowbro is the far superior choice as it learns surf by level up and periodically sheds his tail which you can use as a rare source of meat protein. It’s going to be very tough tho, unless you become cruel and cut your slowbro’s tail off shortly after it regrows
29:15 bro forgot the swicuine
16:00. u chucked your WHAT?
Cool
Bruh, 4 minutes in I had to check I hadn’t accidentally sped up the footage somehow 😅 dudes speaking so fast
Why Vaporeon and not Lapras ir Rhydon? They can surf to
Mom though 😂😂😂
24:00 meowth is an incel 💀💀💀
8:25 😂😂
Smallant is a beast gamer. Nothing more
15:24 missed Suicune
to find a Karan with that tactic you wait until she goes to the store once and then rase the price by 1 cent
As someone with ADHD, the concept of this challenge hurts on a very deep level.
3:51 how our parents use to go to school :
pokémon but it’s monsters inc
Stay away from pokemon, we don't need you on showdown making trash cringe 1400 at best teams and calling them good.
what emulator did he used? melon ds?
23:33 how ist the song called. I know it from Mystry Dungeon
hey u should play radical red man
What does ant use to play Pokémon
Oh hey im playing soulsilver rn :D Edit: oh my god he beat this challenge for less time than ive played this game (18 hours & about to fight the 4th gym)
i dare you to nuzlocke it.
Does anyone know what romhack this is?
Average ADHD experience
this seems way top easy for a gamer with your skills….  do it as a hardcore nuzlocke with level caps
I don’t think the reason you’d choose vaporeon is “surf”…. You’re disgusting
name of the song ? 0:03
4:12 all i can say is wow. the fact you remembered the pathing for that long is actually insane
wrong answers only and first thing i see is beat woman😭😭😭
When just the Pokémon are randomized, it can be fun. This is mental illness.
I love how at 2:35 he went to write notes out of habit and remembered😭
This really give me a headache, thanks.
15:32 fucking suicine
14:20 that guy deserves a prop keeps lying to you lmaoo 18:00 that background music sounds like a phonk song for a min 18:30 again it sounds like a phonk song
Kachaw
Didn't have to actually fight Clair technically as he learned earlier in the game
Random
i can not figure out the background music, it would be lovely if u can tell me what it is
10:57 crasher wake on the right side?
Without notes is just wild! He is really good
I think this has to be one of the hardest challenge
Crazy challenge
15:24 passing on suicune😢
8:26 😂years
Hey does anyone know the name of the background music from 23:21 to 25:45 ? Shazam doesn’t help, it kinda sounds like pokemon music though, maybe from a desert?
8:30 😂
0:18 no notes is actually wild, this is why ant is the goat 🐐
Whats the song at 15:00???
“Vaporeon for surf” I know what kind of man you are😔
Imagine trying to complete the national Pokedex with a randomizer. Even without Pokemon you'd need to trade to acquire, it would be hell.
Only like 4min into the video, and this is sooooo stressfull for my brain :P
OH
18:03 Toothless dance song jumpscare
What is the name of this game
what song 23:20 - 25:45?
This looks terrible to play.... I wanna try it
Bllams
Unrelated question: what’s the song in the backround from 1:05 to 1:15
I enjoyed this
During this my brain just randomly drifted off and started thinking of dark souls for some reason and I immediately got a dark souls ad what kinda sorcerers run these targeted ads?
expected fun but I got sexism :/
i want the vods for this playthrough...
What mod is this version of the game with multiple regions and red at the end?
It blows my mind how he completed the challenge in 8hrs, it would take me probably 100hrs
It would be cool if he did this but instead of badges he did all legendaries
what emulator is this?
Took him 8 hours to beat the entire game, randomized. Took me 8 hours to get 3 badges ;-;
imagine if enemy teams were random as well. so you could very well be facing off with a e4 team in the first battle (unlikely sure)
12:14 is probably one of the best moments of the vid. The way his face lit up after taking a second to process the area is priceless
The fact there’s EXACTLY 1k doors is satisfying
This is when I realised Ant wasn't just smart, but actually super big-brained
i think my adhd shortcircuted watching this video, you have a memorisation skill i could never
Now nuzlocke
0:28 gender fluids be like
How can I download this randomizer?
Now do one with randomized NPCs. The gym trainers can be in your house
25:00 Wth happens to his character  👁️👄👁️
Which emulator did you use
What's the music at 29:31?
You pretty much have to be a pro to do this. I don't even remember where HMs are, to games I've beaten a hundred times lol, let alone all of the events necessary to get certain gym leaders/items. And then you add all of the randomized locations. I'd probably pull my hair out trying to complete this madness.
POV: you are zoro
25:00 what is wrong with ur sprites???
He said on an island he'd want Vaporeon for surf, me personally I'd take Rydon and surf off the island
20:49 smallants character cliches out
Have you ever played Forager? Perfect For you.
happy birthday!
26
I will not stand for quick ball slander.
Like gay people only
NO NOTES????
the town without streets - junji ito
Does anyone know the music that plays at 7:19?
I skipped to a random time and I started hearing the dancing toothless meme
bro discovered the fog gate randomizer
10:03 “you hurt yourself in confusion. What’s new?” DANG
I absolutely love watching pkmn map randomizer runs 😂😂
Why cant he get badges in any order he wants ? Thats the point of a randomiser.  His choice but i think its a stupid rule.
That series of predictions tho
how is he playing on computer?
20:41 Just surf?
18:00 the meme brings me back
25:00 Nobody gonna talk about those glitches?
This GOLDEN GOD can beat SoulSilver in under 8 hours while every door is random. It takes me multiple times as long to beat it normally.
this .... brain ..... hurts......
3:50 I can’t even remember what I ate yesterday
2:35 I THOUGHT IT WAS NO NOTES?
8:35 W security
Anthiner great vid. Talk about a randomized randomizer lol
“I just showed him 1 badge 8 times…. Yeah that checks out”
16:43 what song is this?
I like to thing that the MC has a memory problem and just goes to places around the world forgetting how they got there
Why do you call quagsire stupid when it’s big brother of whoopy boy
20:40 He had us in the first half ngl
17:25 oh nah
15:24 when he missed the suicune at the top right next to ericas gym😭 (didnt see the stream so idk if he mentioned it)
32:13 me when Smant when he doesn’t realize that  Earthquake W2 shots
7:50 bro do be making Clair tantrum valid, secretly her simp?
I just showed him 1 badge 8 times 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro said Car-izard
29:16 bro was under so much pressure he didn’t see suicune
I really want a map randomizer that includes Fire Red, Heart Gold, Emerald, Platinum and Black 2.  You must beat each region in order from Kanto to Unova and beat each person in order. No notes and ALL warps and loading zones are randomized. It would be chaos and incredibly difficult, frustrating and chaotic but brilliant.
Small ant I wanna let you know that your insane in the membrane my friend like the mental space and focus required to do this is insane
How was Kyogre there? Aren't Groudon and Kyogre version exclusives in HGSS?
Yahdah Yahuah Yahusha
20:33 💀
15:24 just casually passes by suicune🤦‍♂️
When does being frustrated with the stupidity of others become arrogance? It's a fine line, and Smant walks it with elegance.
30:45 “volcano bladge” :)). I like these randomizers.
20:43 “I’d bring Vaporeon” *Oh No* “Because it can learn surf” *crisis averted*
Wow
Since when that game had so much stuff wtf
I’m just looking at the suicune near the house that leads to Erica gym which SmallAnt decided to ignore.
Is there a vod for this?
Dudes got an impressive memory.
what if you randomised everything like the pokemon, abilities, moves, locations, items, levels, shops, prices just basically everything that is able to change
man that looked like a terrible challenge - but fun to watch
Beat blue wih blue.
I checked the playback speed like 4 times what the fuck why does it seem so fast lol  Watched it on 0.75x speed
1:38 That Beedle OHHHH was amazing
does anyone know what the song at 6:45 is 🙏
Everytime you faint door reset.
When are they going to remake the first pokemon game in VR?
It would be cool if there was a version of this game where someone actually plays as the rival and every time you bump into each other, you both have to battle.
As someone whos never seen this game before, by brain *hurts*
how do you download the mod?
this is my adhd nightmare
is the vod out for this
i wish smallant did these streams without speed up and no sound it kinda ruined it for me
I have autism, but the amount of things snallant remembers blows my mind still
This is just called Leon the challenge
This was hilarious
Hi, what about a new pokemon challenge? You're not allowed to capture any pokemon, you start with an evoly lvl5 and after each arena, you get a lvl5 evolution of evoly of the type of the arena (if possible). You chose the gen. :)
Didnt even get the games legendary smh
WE DIDN'T CHECK EAST OF VERMILLION GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO oh it's because there's a Snorlax there
This was actually so much fun
If i randomized my rom, could i play it on the drastic app on my phone?
karens hgss sprite is fit
25:02 there may not be Karen’s but there are those people when they see a Pokémon like Gardevoir 🤢
What playing Pokémon in your dreams feels like.
Nah this is easy try radical red
29:15 u missed w Sueicune 😢😢😢
In the Game Boy games the rival says "My name is ???" so I always tell the police officer that his name is ???.
23:00 fun fact: your speech isn't there because of a well known scientific fact. It's actually very common in this type of scenario, because...        We don't talk about Bruno
sorry why do u want to bring vaporeon???
13:23 is that Squeex?
this video has some of the funniest clips to take out of context... "dont walk through me ill be mad if you walk thr- whaaatt" "if you were stuck on an island and could only bring one pokemon who would it be? i would bring vaporeon"
Door randomizer.... how original....
Nooooooooooooooo😢
What’s the track playing around 5:42 into the video?
Elephant memory
Imagine Mike Ross playing this.
11:52 hiker walks on Totodile
This is less of a challenge in the sense of pure pokemon usage and strategy like a lot of the other challenges are. Within a few minutes he had lvl 40's and up pokemon which basically trivialized most of the actual battling. This was more of a memory challenge than anything else. Quite unique honestly. Pretty cool.
Try a wizard101 speedrun
Who is Alph and why does he have ruins
Moral of the story: Groudon is fucking GOOD
Is this video naturally in 1.5 speed? Smant talks so fast
i'm tired
great video
Pokemon but im hoopa
20:35 yeah sure... "because it can learn surf"
Honestly, its a shame he didn't catch Kyogre cause if he found Oak's Lab, he could get the Jade Orb and then go back to Embedded Tower for Rayquaza.
10:14 beating final form Silver before getting the second badge is beyond hilarious
8:04 bro casually has just the first and eighth badges
Karen in pokemon is the least Karen person. God she aged well
This kind of randomizer would be scary for BW/B2W2 because of a certain house in Undella Town
Hahahah
Couldn't stuff be like locked away on the boat and sinjoh ruins by accident or is there code to stop locks like that?
20:50 I saw that glitch
Why not do a complete randomizer? Random items, doors, and Pokémon
The Pokémon reborn ost tho
If Zoro played pokemon
Where can I watch the actual livestream?
The only thing I really know about Pokemon is the part that you battle other Pokemon - I know no story or anything so this was an insane video to watch.
This video gave me a headache with how out of order everything is
15:24 makes dead eye contact with Suicune and ignores him
damn without taking notes
I am some extra dimensional being that just teleports wherever Smant needs me.
My Alzheimer's dementic brain could never remember a single location
……..
this was my first pokemon game and i remember everyone else in my class playing diamond and pearl and i had this wondering why it was different when i was playing
anyone know what the music starting at 7:19 is? Thx
18:14 my same reaction exactly lmao.  Also, 19:35.
Leon be like
29:15 Is that a wild Suicune he could of caught?  I never played this version.
13:53 they weren’t lying. In fuschia, you can find pal park instead of the safari zone.
This would honestly be neat to try. I love this kind of content. And also.. now Smallant will be truly Gigabrain
Wow
Vaporeon???
So I'm confused as to why Kyorgre and Groudon were there
This is the 5D chess of Pokemon.
Not being able to write anything down.... so mean lol
14:40 What's the song please?
happy birthday
i like that erin is the randomizer, and it didn't seem to beat
Bro is Zoro if Zoro was smart
When you actually want a Karen, they don’t show up. 😂
No lie I wouldn't do this
My guess for smallant least favourite Quagstire
This is honestly probably not the HARDEST randomizer but the Longest one to do, you're not restricted to some secondary challenge so you could always just grind up and eventually figure out the way through the gyms
This time it was randomized but in a specific pattern. Imagine the pain and struggle of the a challenge where instead of being randomized in a random specific patter it is random ALWAYS you would be trapped forever lol
SmallAnt with a clean shave doesn't feel right
16 minutes in when you see “2 hours 42 minutes” on the counter. This is edited like it’s fast-paced, but damn this took a lot of effort!
3:50 No. This much brain is not allowed.
Imagine a randomiser that has ALL regions and you have to complete them in order.  It would drive anyone insane.
25:03 what the hell
I totally forgot about how beautiful HG/SS are. They're truly a visual masterpiece, as well as in many other ways. Gonna replay!
rom name
Bro got the greatest ability an anime protagonist could ask for!
Which Emulator is this?
32:51 he forgets the fact blizzard always hits in hail
I hate watching small ant challenges cuz he always uses x items and then it just makes everything easy
3:30 “that’s all of my money bro…” 🤣 man that’s cruel
1:22 “dude stole an action replay while he was at it!” 🤣
anybody know if there's a full vod of this? i couldn't find one
20:40 Did you know....... 🙂
New speed run tactic; cheat.
ant finding groudon and being like "finally a legendary" when hed run past suicune like 6 times... sadge :( suicune sweep banned
Did you upload a Vod for this one on the vod channel I'm having trouble locating it
It’s so funny to me that this is the game I know the best, inside and out, in every way my knowledge of all the silver, gold and crystal games outclasses any other game, and yet within the first 5 minutes I was so beyond lost it wasn’t even funny
20:50 what da player doin
19:36 what on earth
14:39 music?
It was the only stream I've ever watched live and I could feel the dead on the inside reaching through the screen
2:14 me at the club
30:16 never in a million years would I hear him say "its just a kyogre"
20:40 Vaporeon is also the most compatible with the human species I've heard
min 10:54 arena leader Marinus  top right
Skipped the e4 rematch before red
I appreciate the mystery dungeon music through the 24 minute mark😍😍
do you use desmume?
whats song at 24:00 ?
The best part of this is that this is basically how I felt just playing regular Pokémon games as a kid. I had NO idea where I was going.    Just like in life 🙂
Where’s Pokémon challenges?
this is what happens if you use Teleport while you're Confused
Ayo bro lotta pokemans can learn surf, why vaporeon
I love HGSS for the fact that it makes you do plot, no matter how convoluted the ROM hack
The path he had to take at 3:50 to get balls feels like math
What emulator do you use?
Does anyone know Where he plays this ? Like which emulator
Pokémon Black or white but your Pokémon don’t level up they get XP and get the moves evolve but they always stay at level one as soon as the catch them they revert to level one but with all the same moves!
is there a full vod of this?
„Yesss Groudon“ „Fk it’s just Kyogre“ Groudon to Kyogre: „Suck it Nerd“
Hello, where does the video's music tracklist may bé found ? Thank you
imagine if every attack your 4 attacks changes
this video just makes me appreciate how much variation there is in the areas across HG and SS. literal perfect pokemon games and if they ever get remade i hope gamefreak doesnt give them the BDSP treatment
Which Pokémon game is it
I literally was watching one of the emerald ones, and I thought "man could you imagine doing this in Hg or Ss, that would take a masochist", here we are
im gonna have to damage calc that EQ on that snorlax crit. cus aint no way. U WERE UNDER BY 24 LEVELS
Tell me why my saves always disappear when I try to do emulators and randomizers
whats your emulator
"I just showed him 1 badge 8 times"😂
Pokemon but you play as leon
Purplecliffe 17:33
Casually ignores suicune 😂😂
Plzzz what song is playing in the background at 18:24 plzzz
imagine if there were testing rooms added
"We're just gonna fly and hope it explodes."  —SmallAnt 2022
Lol I'm so glad red beat u once. True testament to the great champion himself.
Id bring abra just teleport me to safety
i watched this high and the video melted my brain. i have no clue how u were able to figure this out
20:40 Ant. Are you sure surf is the only reason?
His memory scares me
Like the videos except have to watch on mute cause your over use of bros and let's go's is borderline obnoxious. Other than that top quality videos
Hehe, do you imagine a pokemon run, but the chot controls the npcs battles?
I hate playing old gen Pokémon but ant make it looks so fun lmao
3:51 my parents telling me how they go to school back in the days
What app do u use to play pokemon?
What emulator does Small Ant use does anyone know. His gameplay is so smooth.
14:55 hahaha
how in the actual hell did he manage this?? Sabrina's gym TELEPORTERS were random, too!?
Personaly i say random level is hard but this... i havent even watch the vido yet...
Could anyone point me to the name of the music between about 7:17 and 9:50 ?
This feels like a journey trough the backrooms
This concept is so fun, dark souls has a mod just like it and it was also a ton of fun
can we just acknowledge that the spreadsheet thing was hilarious. Not sure if it was put in by the modder but if it wasnt thats absolutely insane.
A day in the life of the Galarian Champion, Leon
You should randomize trainers, so a gym leader or elite member could be randomly swapped and be in a cave or in route 5
It’s like the back rooms
11:59 that is disturbing
Bro props to you for doing this cause I got confused in the first 2 minutes trying to remember where everything was but love the content man
Are you gonna upload the full stream?
The greatest part was seeing him still have a level 5 todadile
me who has no idea what the hell is going on but my im using my 1 braincell
Small ant can you speed run super Mario color splash for the Wii U if u don’t see this or don’t decide to do it it’s ok with me just a suggestion
Am I the only one who realized he missed one?
Ant consistently ending up in the PokeMarts and department stores is just the Backrooms
My name is Adrian
bruh go to  20:00
Just now I realized that Ant didn't challenge the elite 4 again just to beat red
do you have the full run through uploaded somewhere
"Sabrina's gym has been randomized" I felt echos of pain and hadn't even gotten a quarter through the video
I'm only 4:26 in and my anxiety is through the roof lol
Anyone else see Suicune in the back ground
now I want a hack where all the NPC conversations are randomized, including TM/HM dispensers etc
Smant: Says Pokeathelon sucks. Me: HOW DARE!?      I enjoyed the Pokeathelon ;3;
Can someone tell me where is this played? As in switch? PC? Or where is this? Plan to play back all the Pokémon games I’ve missed when I was a kid
There is only one Karen in HGSS, and her name is Clair.
OMG my brain hurts :D
I’m trying to get a riolu but I have gotten like 10 farfetch’d
This was nutty
there is a groudon in soul silver ??
"no sir. This is kidnapping. I am 10y old and dont wanna go." Made my day
So is he playing this on a DS or on an emulator or a random 3rd thing I don’t know about lol
So he cheated at the start
You should do this challenge only using shinines and taking no damage
This was structured worse than your last ones. It didn’t flow as well. Probably bc of how the game is
disliked only for you called quagsire stupid and ugly, hes the best boy and hes trying his hardest ok!!
It’s freakin hilarious how overleveled he is on so many of these battles
7:47 ok Ant literally how dare u I have spent so many hours in  the Pokeathon. my word, The blasphemy is unreal. I am prone to forgive a brother but please do not make such a mistake again
Bro memorized this stuff like how I memorized the 50 states placements and capitals in 5th grade
item spam and still punished lmao
Dude playing pokemon in 4 dimensions
13:20 onward for a couple seconds you were talking to truegreen7, is that correct?
bro what a shitshow of a intro title "I TRIED POKEMONS HARDEST RANDOMIZER EVER OF ALL THE TIMES"  first 5 seconds "so, some random dude on the internet send me some pokemon.exe"  ?? why
Ruins of alpha deez nuts
How can I download this rom?
This whole video was a massive "This isn't the Chum Bucket" moment
This is so good
You have to eat a croissant
imma be honest, i got a shiny totodile in 50 resets
This is pretty much what happens to the guy in the second Grave Encounters movie
I’m boutta miss a house in viridian on purpose 😳😳😳
This honestly looks like so much funn
Are both kyogre and groudon available in pokemon ss? I tought you had to trade kyogre from hg. If they are both available in ss are they too in hg? Im Just playing hg for the first time now and want to complete the pokedex as much as i can without trading cause idk how that works tbh and have no one to trade with but thought you could only capture kyogre. (Im at gym 8 atm so dont have them yet)
i was going to comment about him missing the suicune at 29:15 but he didnt even bother to catch kyogre
this hurt my brain
I'm shocked seeing how much ant has grown over the past couple years. And yet everything I like about his content has stayed the same.  Great chat interaction, fun pokemon hacks, chill vibes, and somehow the biggest brain
3:48 Smallant just exploring the whole time, and suddenly stringing together all these rooms to get to the store is such a casual flaunting of his genius memory wtf.
I love how the video starts off with the cliche, "A random stranger sent me this", but SmallAnt actually included the name of the person who sent it and mentions it on stream. Really fills it out and assures you it's not set up, someone actually just randomly sent this to monstrosity to Tanner! xD
If anyone else is wondering, the music playing from 27:46 to 28:48 is  Nimbasa City theme from Pokemon Black/White
Can you play this on a android phone
I never knew you could get groudon or kyogre in this game lol
That guy in chat @ 2:06 looks familiar 🤔
you should try to play pokemon red while a professional fighter chases you around the room punching you... i think that's the ACTUAL hardest version
He forgot the elite four's second phase before red.
This reminds me of that Rick and Morty episode where morty takes the portal gun and get lost traveling to different dimensions.
they say smalls brain gained quite a few new folds that day.
I would bring garadous to a island because he can learn surf and waterfall
How i download that rom in DS
Tryhard
<3
4:00 Now that was big brain
I thought after the second round of eight badges you have to verse the elite four again before you can challenge red
"we just gotta pick totodile its the best one" *instant sub and like*
Great video, the one thing that was the most mind boggling for me was that Smallant's voice is slightly pitched higher
This is like the Pokémon version of the back rooms dreams lmao
This video made me mix up every single gen 1 and 2 city
Happy birthday
3:51
Hey smallant love the videos can you explain how I can play pokemon on pc using roms
rip technoblade fly on
where is ludwig! seems like the guy to get clout from the mogul moves shirt lmao
YouTube algorithm needs to learn tone, got this after watching a video of a YouTuber's last video
SmallAnt's brain is literally as complex as the millennium puzzle from Yu-Gi-Oh.
Nice video
Smallant should stream chess lol
Damn, impressive.
My head hurts my brother
What stream is this
Leon simulator
I need to see small ant map randomized race someone in the black2/white2 games. Just as big if not, bigger than hgss. The amount of warps is insane, not all entrances are even visible
Can you beat pokemon in hard mode, but if your pokemon faints, it dies and you have to catch new ones to keep going. no healing items. 🤔
Mans said he wanna beat the JoJo leaders
18:00 can someone PLEASE tell me the name of this song? I beg
This mod was probably made by The Keymaker from Matrix 2
you said meowth is an incel lmfao
18:08 he finds an unobtainable ares in Johto gen 4
HG/SS is my favorite honestly
some bullshit this is. way too much to remember...
"if i ask chat for help tell me the wrong answer" 5 seconds latr "am i a boy or a girl?" 2 seconds later "you guys say im a girl" hey they're doin what you said
Dude, I had to double check if my video speed is at x1.25
Holy shit imagine how hard this would be when you’re stoned lmao
Props, Ant! Thanks for the fun video
Palkia was having a bit too much fun in his vacation to johto
Probably how doctor who feels
Kinda funny that he runs into both Gen 3 legendary pokemon yet he didn't run into Lugia or Ho-Oh... the legendaries for the game and generation he's actually playing
Whats with the suicune a 29:15
Was Ant just ignoring the Suicune at 29:00 ?
This is so cursed and I love it
18:00 when the driftviel music started the wave of nostalgia and the best Pokémon music track hit hard.
Good shit bro 💯👌🏻💪🏻
My hat's off to you, sir. This is one hell of a feat you accomplished.
Bro MY BRain hurts
It's like a Rubik's cube once you got the first few things in place you just flew through it
yooo why did smallant not see suicune at 15:23 twice.... and another at 29:15
Now do it with pokemon randomizer, no items in battle and perma-death on.
the background music is so good, anyone have the playlist?
Imagine going to a market and accidentally finding red And battling him with lvl 8 starter,
pokemon, but you have zoro's sense of direction
Did SmallAnt technically have to fight Clair, considering he could’ve just gotten the badge from that one dude?
1:23 "stole an action replay while at it" that's the funniest quote I've ever heard
Happy birthday
This randomizer should be called "hurt yourself in confusion"
This is Zoro lvl Randomizer
I had that Meowth pokemon episode on a GBA cartridge, watched it all the time
Awesome vid
"If I ever ask chat for help, give me the wrong answer." You say that like it wouldn't happen anyway.
props to the dude for dividing 8h in a 30 min video ((60x8)/16)
Celebrating possible non-linear features in the upcoming pokémon games be like:
Ash Ketchum challenge: You play through any gen 4-5 game, but you can only use pokemon that are weak against the current gym for that gym. So for platinum, the only available options before gym 1 would be chimchar, burmy and shinx. I guess technically shinx is eligible against gardenia since grass resists electric, but chimchar and burmy would have to be boxed and youd have to catch new water/ground types. For the elite 4, you always have to lead off with a pokemon that has a type disadvantage against their lead.
I haven't played HGSS in years but this video reminded me how top tier of a game it was.
You should play the pokemon storm silver rom
17:50
Does anyone know the ost that starts around 28:50?
Your baby wooper might be getting a new reganole form
does anyone know what hoodie that is
19:42
Nice
Beat a Pokémon game but you can only use a certain color of shiny Pokémon
Could someone help me with the randomizer, doesn't work with me, when I put the rom into it, nothing happen...
30:13 “it’s JUST a water god”
imagine this, but with randomized pokemon too
What about pokemon but my Pokemon are permanently confused, even if I switch them out. That would be hard
Now imagine if someone tried to do a nuzlocke of this
Can you senf me the raNdomizer link
I love and hate gen 2 at the same time. Love because totodile and cyndaquil and my two favorite. Hate because it forces me to choose and when I was a kid I could NOT make a decision.
wow; well done!
Play loomian legacy on roblox
Smant’s “are ya winning son?” moment with his mom was so heartwarming
Post more 😭
What emulator do you use to play Pokémon games
somehow when smallant mom says "are you winning son?" it's not a meme They're too good!
Play PokeWilds
Viewer: if you were stuck on an island what Pokémon would you bring? SmallAnt: Vaporeon because it can learn surf. Me: Vaporeon😳
remember when wong says "fortify your mind" I feel that when trying to read chats lies.
I really, really appreciate these videos, SmallAnt  I don't have time to sit and watch a full stream anymore, so this is perfect for me.
That Pokemon Battle Revolution music in the background was so nostalgic ahaha love that, I miss that game.
Opposite of this is digimon and everything is normal
this is your brain on drugs
To make this impossible you could say make notes but it's a nuzzlock
I have a cool idea, you should do a super mario odyssey manhunt where you get some sort of a lead
I figured out how do a glitch that allows to climb bit higher that may allow you to get less captures in mario
is he play pokemmo ?
Was smant sick when he played this? He sounds kinda off
You should do a challenge where you start off with a level 100 team but each time you battle you lose a level
11:53 if mayro heard you he would cry right now
there is a harder one where you and your opponents' team are swapped. so the hard battles are easy and the easy ones are hard pretty easy overall :) only took me a casual 2 1/2 days to beat
Can you pls 100% heroes path, basically making the whole map turquoise
This video alone gave me so much anxiety
Can you speedrun apple knight
He really did a great job making it look easy
oh my god this randomizer watching you process everything this has been incredibly entertaining and impressive, you big brain dude you
i had to like this video. this man just did this in 8 hours. what an absolute unit he is.
This is crazy. It is enjoyable
Epic
He said vaporeon  for surf but we all know thats a lie and know the real reason
can u play undertale?
I got idea for you to speed run. In ARK there new weapon called Mjoinir. You need be level 190 to use it. So try get Mjoinir as fast as possible. Also takes very long time.
Hey can you beat BOTW without beating BOTW (Or you can't do that)
Oh god as soon as I saw Sabrina’s gym
Play subnatica below 0
Minecraft but you can't eat...
I gotta ask. Smallant if it goes through how are you gonna deal with bill c-11
20:42 ruined
This dude is just wired differently. How does he not have a huge swolehead like ki-adi mundi to fit his galaxy sized brain?
Pure hell.            This man has far too much patience.
and now nuzlocke this shit xD
Does anyone know what song is played in the background at 23:22-25:45? It sounds good!
I forgor smallant is canadian and its cold even on summer, i was wondering why he was wearing a hoody until i realized lol
I have a challenge for you. Speedrun obtaining Zygarde Complete in Pokémon Sun and Moon WITHOUT looking up the locations for the cells and cores.
Aight, now nuzlocke that bitch
Can you do a pokemon ultra moon speed run?
16:16
oi smant i had a substitute teacher get mad at a kid for watching one of your streams in class he even knew who you were
16:28 doesnt even question it just has that face
Fantastic video 😺
Love the video
just wanted to know ant how do u play your Pokémon games do you use like a emulator and then tweak it with the randomizer or what. I want to start my own yt channel doing challenges for Pokémon but i don't know how to setup the Pokémon games or how to get them like you do please respond thanks ant
0:46 "my mom's not feeling to good" *HENCE THE GLITCHED UP PERSON SHE IN ON THE SCREEN*
This reminds me of the mystery gift event for pokemon Ranger SoA. We're palkia switched up all the entrances
Ant turns invisible at 20:48 and just doesn’t react lmao
All According To My Plan My Plan Was Making It Soo Hard
"why do people keep interrupting me bro" My whole complaint of the DS and 3DS games
You’re voice sounded a little different, did you have a sore throat or something?
BYE!!!
Dude i miss the pokeathlon. I used to play that all the time because it was basically mario party but with the pokemon i built a bond with as a child. Some of the most fond memories in my life
love the content
waaaaaaaaaaay toooooo dank
Pokemon but every step you take you teleport to a random location
You should do a Pokémon randomizer where the trainers teams are randomized  It would be funny to see you fight the rival and it being the champions Pokémon
Love the content Smallant!
He just ignored suicune in 15:20, lol xD
Small ant you dont have the pencil sharpening world record anymore
7:11
Streamchat at 24:36 :'D
Quagsire is an expired wooper
Heart Gold was my first Pokemon game ever and I've played it since it came out, even had one of those huge guide books for it as a kid, why am I just today learning you could catch the Hoenn legendaries... I'd beaten Red but never got the Orb or maybe never knew what to do with it.
heartgold was my first pokemon game and the goldenrod music brings me so much nostalgia
Anybody else think that a lot of randomizers these days get a little too zealous about randomizing? When you start randomizing everything from the types, moves, power level of moves, PP value of moves, catch rates, etc. you're not even playing Pokemon anymore. You're just blindly fiddling with mathematical chaos.
"You gotta pick the best one and it's totodile."  Yep, that's why I'm subscribed.
That was a nightmare to watch... Amazing !
red in sprout tower was so cool
my grandma is a karen so lol
This is some backrooms type stuff
You should do the one hit oblitarator trials without using the one hit oblitarator
now do it but every time you beat a gym or black out it rerandomizes
This man is the Kobe Bryant of challenge runs. He never does things the easy way and gives the highest effort possible in everything he tries
Randomizee where the trainer’s pokemons are random (both how many pokemons, lvl, and which pokemon)
20:40 reminds me of something that’s uh-  terrible…
i don't get how the thumbnail is related ?
No second elite four?
29:15 the Suicune!!!
does he play soulsilver on his pc? how do i play without it going fucking black screen
you should do OneMoon%
20:49 what happened to the character 25:01 Again?
very good
pls Tell me, what in gods Name ist the Name of the music at 29:28. Like i Heard IT once nur never knew what IT was called
Hey smant can you do my Luigi balloon world in sand kingdom please the code is 027 LMY 2G4
I never knew you could teleport with abra, also for some reason I remember next to nothing of these locations/events, even tho Ik ive played soul silver loads my mind has gone blank lol I def need to revisit it
Hey do you think you could make a video on brilliant diamond or shining pearl?
Hey, If i remember correctly, you live in Canada? There is a bill in Canada, titled Bill C-11, is currently being proposed. This bill will allow the Canadian government to control which media is allowed in Canada. They will block anything that is foreign or non-canadian. This could be detrimental to Canadian Youtubers and Streamers such as yourself. The only way this can be stopped is for more Canadian media producers to speak about it.
"Only level 39? Why is the level so slow??"  Because Johto has a terrible level curve post game. lol
Please play pokemon radical red
How do you play Pokémon because I can’t
Praise God
damn that memory is godly
I got a idea for a pokemon challenge Nuzlock pokemon but you lose all your move at the end of every battle so you need to use struggle or tm/hm
I never knew the weather trio were capturable in these games.
Æ
Awesome game
I wish they’d make a new Pokémon game with 16 gyms. I doubt they’ll ever do it again because game freak got lazy with their formula
👍
FireRed map randomizer when?...
i knew the medicine was gon be crazy
13:48 So I know this is a Gen 4 game but come on. Those are just the same sprites as Diamond, Pearl and Platinum.
you probably wont see this but if you do could you please talk out about bill c-11 the bill being passed in canada to try and restrict media such as youtube (you being a Canadian youtuber/twitch streamer and all)
Why do you sound different
Can’t imagine the nightmare of editing this
Crazy how he went through the whole game without finding the sinjoh ruins. Was waiting for that to happen
30:14 wait, so both games have both legendaries and they're just blocked off?... fuck, that's shitty...
I also found the will, the will to live
if someone see this what's the song starting at 23:20 please.
Take a shot every time Smallant says Viridian in stead of Violet
Watching on 0.75x speed makes him talk at almost normal human speed 😂
Can you try my speedrun idea for Kirby and the forgotten land? Gotcha% get all gotcha figures as fast as possible. thx
Isnt that the same thing that you played batteling against a speedrunner? ;P
now hc nuzlocke it xD
I think that a cool challenge would be : every 20 minutes the mod changes and you start with no mods
my head hurts
Dude, You a champ
i am thoroughly intimidated by Ant's memory. literally impossible
How the hell did you encounter Kyogre in soul silver???
combine this with alot of other randomizers the everymizer (or something better) edit:and extreme nuzlocke it, extreme everymizer nuzlocke
you should speedrun plants vs zombies on the ds : )
Beat minecraft but fire spreads on everything
How do you get fire red map in hart gold plizzzzz tell me
congrats on the new house smant!
I live for small ant randomizer content
Dude. Please upload more pokemon videos. Idc if it's 4-6 vids cut from the same stream
Whooper = god
This is every game for those of us that have the memory of a goldfish.
Wait what about a randomizer that makes it so that it is randomized every time
Love these vids
Smallant is actually TheDoooo
I wanna see him try a gen 5 style like this
I can’t explain it but smallant did no sound like smallant this video
Hey Smant, you should do a Pokémon nuzlocke but everytime you use a move you automaticly switch Pokémon in your team! Thought it was a pretty cool idèa 😎
You should do a race where you and your competitor get to secretly make changes (before starting) to each other’s games. These changes would follow agreed upon rules as to how many and what kind.  Say you each get to swap 4 Pokémon of any of the gym leaders (keeping the level the same as the Pokémon swapped out.)  That could add an extra wrinkle of strategy and surprise to the racing format. (How best to mess with the other persons game?)
This doesn't just randomize the game it randomizes your thoughts
Ayyy, I made those sprites you used for the gym tracker back in 2008! Neat to see them use here lol.
You should do this randomizer but make it a Nuzlocke lol
this is makin me mad lol
You can do a challenge the lvl is randomised
My brain fried just trying to remember alongside with Ant. "How..." is all I can say from this.
anyone else think the wifi doors would hold all his secrets
Trying to keep any kind of track of what’s going on here hurts my brain.
15:23 Ant you missed Suicune it was right there!!!
how tf does he do all this in less than 8 hrs
26:07 “young man” wait a sec thought he was playing Lyra
would of been more fun to watch on YT as a Nuzlock
Hey Smallant! I have a video idea: you could play pokemon emerald with only bidoof!
If he was stuck on an island, he'd bring Vaporeon. *And his reasoning was "it can learn surf."*  I dont trust this man.
When he said he’d take no notes I was like “so your a masochist” and I was also “that’s… that’s just torture”
Hey smallant, I came across this stupid hard rom hack called pokemon radical red. It's super hard for me and I'm wondering how you'd handle it :)
32:14 was hilarious man
That was really cool to see a Super Mario 64 Randomizer but for Pokemon, and under 8 hours, too. Whoa! Neat.
20:39 SmallAnt what are you going to do with that Vaporeon? There are plenty of other mons that get surf.
lol i remember runescape vids lol
Play this in .75 speed and he sounds normal
I am joining you
This is the universe where Team Rocket wasn't stopped.
This reminds me of that one action scene with all the doors in Monsters Inc.
We need more runs of this mod. Its so fascinating how you really start to form some sort of map. Im sure everyone watching had some idea of where at least one thing was. And the magic of it is every run will be completely different
he kinda makes this look easy
idk why i find this so entertaining lol
The fact he remembers all this blows my mind.
Well this was fucking boring :D
Purple Cliffe needs to do this one
3:50 you will get what?
No notes makes this more trouble to me than it's worth xD Good on you.
I would absolutely LOVE to try this 😂
Bro this is the coolest shit lol
It's like in Monsters Inc when they ran through all the different doors
He randomized every location, yet he still can continue the game faster than I can on the vanilla game.
Love the PMD music :,)
Bros cement
heh my name is will :P
i would like to see a collab with smallant and shadypenguin!!
Ask grafty to make Coco nut mall in oddesy i think thats fun
your voice changed
Ja9 lmao
I'd bring vaporeon.  Those who don't know: ☺ Those who know 😰
I love that stream where he just know about whirlpool quest and stuff but he didnt note anything down, it look so much painful 🤣
30:15 idk what reaction I was expecting but def not that
This is the most bonkers challenge I have ever seen.
I don't know why but Ant sounded differently to me in this video
"Meowth is an incel"
love how he just ignored sinjoh ruins and didn't get a legend egg
god i love heart gold soul silver, one of if not my first video game
ironmon is harder
why does ant's voice sound different
your pokémon videos are legit the peak of amazing content
Good video, bad vibes... But hey, your decision to upload this ig
You should be allowed to take notes. That's a stupid rule.
I doubt this comment will stay, as smant deletes lots of negative comments, however I find it dissapointing that he still uploaded a video that was the subject to such a big controversy, if you wanna argue that he's right or wrong idc, but still shouldnt have uploaded it either way.
25:02 what just happened to the sprite
25:01 Why were the sprites so cursed lmao?
No hate, but that title made me think it was something else other than a map randomizer. Guess I got clickbaited
Chat was such a menace as always
can you play earthbound?
Its nice to be hearing Pokemon Battle Revolution Music. Such a unknown game.
this is so chaotic i love it
24:30
The maker of this model has the same name as me except the e is an a
His stranded island answer was brilliant
Honestly, the most impressive part was the Red battle.
"I just showed him one bagel eight times" best sentence of the day
HE MISSED SUICUINE 15:22
Pokestadium is fun :(
12:40 the first time in history Whitney wasn't a pain to beat
Do This  Talkatoo,Coinless,No Checkpoint,No Damage%
the department store is the key to the multiverse
Is there a vod of the full run?
Insane
Is it possible to get softlocked in this if an early gym leader spawns in some crazy far door?
happy late birthday
I love how the fast paced editing of this video makes Ants descent into madness even funnier
what software does he play on?
15:39 Route 216 starts 15:54 Route 216 _starts_
3:01 the face he did when he saw that the warp where randomized prove that it is the moment he realised the hell he just put himself into
Love the visit to a random streamer
Can you play Mario Golf 64?
This… is a nightmare and brilliant at the same time.
This stresses me out but I love it haha.
You should add the random pokemon levels every fight from the previous video to this mod and try to beat it
1:23 that action replay line brought back so many memories LOL.
Ant, is there anywhere i can watch this full stream? I looked on your twitch and didn't see it.  Edit: Found it, disregard question
How did he get Groudon without the red orb from Mr Pokémon?
R̵̗̗͆̍́̈́̎͗̂̂̈̀̔͠e̸̡̡͚̟͕͚̼̗̱̱̠̻̅͐̊̏̀̍̈́͋̚ͅͅḍ̶̜̀̍̏͛͆̈́͒̀̕ú̶͓̫̳̙̭͓͍͈̬̝̹͊̿̉́̀̕͜ņ̷̛̘̖͕̰̲̘͈̘͈̼̉̎̎̈́̌d̷̨̢̡̤̠̜͕͕̱̠̲̓͑͌͝ä̶̺͉͕͈͓̙̦́̊͋n̷̨̡̮̰̖̖̯͔̦̖̠͇͉̫͛̃̀̃̅͋͆t̸̡̢̨̛̜͍̬͍̬͉͙͈̝̺̔͌͐͛̊́͒͘͠ͅ
Realized I didn't do my diligence and increase engagement. Here's to the formula.
I would have had to do it with notes
Bro is jest me or is is voice different
You should play Pokemon Fools Gold if you havent already, well worth it
I remember finding a Pokemon Emerald Romhack (Pretty sure it was called Eris Emerald) That all Pokémon and Moves up to Galar, with a built-in Randomizer.  Now imagine having every Pokemon, Ability, Learnset, Loadzone, and types randomized with every Pokemon.   Pretty sure I described heaven or hell depending on who ya ask.
I never know what mons to use in fan games or randomizers
*He can't keep getting away with this*
The next randomizer race should follow these rules, would take a long time but would be fun to watch
Now combine this with a regular randomizer so that all Pokémon are random as well
I have two ideas, The first idea is Pokémon but every single trainer has the same Pokémon at the same level as you and my second idea is Pokémon but every battle teleports you to a random place.
"nooo!!! it's all of my *MONEY BROO!!* "  Nice 😆
Why is there sinnoh postgame?
Whats the background music at 25:26
Not being able to write stuff down… that’s rough.
The fact you did this without a spreadsheet is admirable
"Meowth is an incel" killed me
how does anybody have the brain capacity for this?????
I've been loving these Minecraft 2v2s, keep em coming
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.      !.!
imagine you have to edit this video ur brain just evaporates
The Pokemon SoulSliver/HeartGold runs are always premium content
"Are you racing someone?" "I'm racing my brain shutt-" *video buffers*
20:31 Goddamn OUTPLAYED
What emulator does smallant use? Just want the ffw feature.
Who let hoopa go wild placing random rings in pokemon gold
anyone know the song playing at 12:00 ?
Smallant. Breaks down a door “WHERE IS THE JUICE”
20:33 the sheer horror I felt when Ant said he’d bring Vaporeon is truly a testament to why the internet was an awful idea
This is so crazy. They taken the Randomizer to the next level.
Please can u send a link to play this in your discord it looks so much fun
Dude, Smallant is gonna be a grandparent and he will tell his grandchildren, “Remember, the small dome in lavender town puts you in the finale gym. don’t screw it up”.
When i read the title, i didt know what the randomizer was, but i felt pity knowing that if Smant says its hard, it’s probably hard
With how many checks there are to make gym leaders be available in their gyms, even without the "no notes" rule, this would probably end up being the most interesting thing ever to see as a race.
16:00
how do you play pokemon soulsilver on the computer
love u smallant
Anyone know the name of the song at 4:47? I never played this game so I don't know what city/town that is
I'd have gone mad early on and tried to eat or marry chat
I lost it when I saw him warp into Sabrinas gym. PAIN.
Lvl randomizer
Why do you like wooper?
3:50 - looks like my grandpa's school way
19:30
My brain would give me up if I did that randomizer
Notes are nice though
Play a pokemon game as a gym leader, only one random type allowed for your entire team
My eyes got a bit wide when you casually walked past that Suicune at 15:24.
Lol, I evolved my Zubat to a Crowbat.
“Yo we found lance”
what's the song name at 18:00
Was he sick ? Sounds sick
Fly
Only person who has the mind and patience to do something this ridiculous
Ant voice sounds a little bit different
I'd have quit no cap....
Hey there chief I have a idea for a Pokémon nuslocke you are gonna see your skill I call it the impossilocke here are the rules:you can only use 3 Pokémon if a Pokémon dies with 2 types you must spin a wheel to see which type you can’t use for the rest of the run you can only use nurse joy you can only use weak to decent Pokémon you can’t use HM slaves and must teach it to one of your Pokémon each you can only use the weakest starter and only use ONE Pokémon for a gym you can only go and get 3 pokeballs and if a Pokémon evolves into a better one you must use a ever stone on it to not give it any items or a evolution if you have a masterball you must use it on a bad Pokémon and if you use it on the legendary Pokémon you must kill it immediately after using the masterball on it if you some how think you can do this think again CAUSE YOU HAVE TO GO ON THE SLOWEST SETTINGS AND CAN’T SKIP CUTSCENES if you want to be using something like a ponyta for example think again you have to use it against a water gym leader you can’t try and  use fossil mons these are just the rules if you want to know more tell me in the replies I hope somebody will listen to this and try it out hope to see a impossilocke soon if you are seeing this spread the word :D
Now do the same thing except the TP’s different each time you go through aloading zone.
Now this is the open-world Pokémon game everyone was wanting.
Ant please stop insulting my boy quasire. He did nothing wrong
Me being an Adrian yes  Sees Adrien 😭
Good game.
20:40 ayo surf aint the only thing it knows
you're a genuis
Its crazy that this video is number 41 in the GERMAN trends xD
WHAT IS THE SONG AT 13:11
I prefer the old editing style where its slower paced
yeah right he'd bring vaporeon for "surf"    I would bring mudkip for surf
credit to the mod producer?
Cyndaquil is the best one
we back at the uhhhhhhh
SmallAnt on trending again! LET'S GO!
In 10 years he will randomly remember this
In 10 years she’ll randomly remember all of this
Respectful petition for new botw content
15:23 smant missed suicune
20:41 did you know that in terms of-
As always, super impressive small ant!!!
I WANT THE VOD SO I CAN SPEND 7 HOURS WATCHING YOU SUFFERRR AHAHAHHAHAHAHH ( love you smant)
Now do this, but make your team and pokemon on the route random too 🤣
I am amazed at how this guy functions for almost 8 hours straight with so much memory recall of all the loading zones
Love the video! These loading zone randomizers are always the best.
i never did finish this game, I propably should!
i love these Videos!
Late happy birthday
for infomation. on around 3:04 the reason why levels of the wild pokemon was low was because the game has 2 regiions to with the same 100L cap so levels are lower to spread out the level cap more
Tune in next time to see Ant suffer through randomized doors and NPCs!
29:15 am i the only one who saw suicune vibin
We gotta do this for every pokemon game it’s so good
Now do it all with the enemy pokemon being level 100
20:40 yeah, because vaporeon can use surf, *that's why*
I just watched the Video with an blank mind
I already watched the full stream but I don't mind rewatching this recap
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.
You should play Pokémon conquest next its a really fun Pokémon game that not many people know about or play the rom hack Pokémon conquest reconquered
I would completely suck at this challenge, my memory is basically non-existent lmao
How to dawnload it please tell
I did beat a similar randomizer but only after few houres with notes  (sorry for my bad english)
26:29 Are you gonna fight Barack Obama?
This is so crazy.
23:13 - We don't talk about...
Jezus this guy that didnt allow you to make notes must either hate you or be a sadist cus this is insane xD id go insane atleast
MY BRAAAAAIIN
Smallant has more mental fortitude than a bus full of monks
Why not catch kyogre
You should do another 880 odyssey run
Can u post this on vod channel
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
is it just me who thinks his voice is a bit diff in this vid???
Now.. to create the ultimate randomizer. Random doors, random encounters, random types, and random abilities.
My head started to hurt 3 minutes in but the I realized  I dont have to keep track of all this, let SmallAnt deal with that BS
"Why do people keep interrupting me?" Because it's HGSS, nothing is allowed to go smoothly in this game.
Gg
wait there are 16 badges is SS? ive been missing out on half the game for years!?
20:44 I'd bring arceus because HE'S LITERAL FUCKING GOD HE CAN TELEPORT YOU HOME.
"Leader chuck sent out primape, i chucked out discharge."  o__o
I wanna see this with the spreadsheet lol
Next do this with randomized mons as well. Do the full rando to make it even more chaotic
Hi
0:30 Totodile is absolutely tf not the best Johto starter. It is my favorite though
Never nickname Pokemon.
Anyone know what’s the name of the BGM at 29:38?
u're a monster
Smant kinda looks like Abby Shapiro
I Chucked out a discharge? Oh... uh, you might need a doctor...
Please tell me you compete against people with this game
The badge graphic looked sick!
Haven't played these remakes but is that a Suicune chilling at 15:23 ?
That streamer who you got randomly gifted a sub to, you just visiting their channel MADE their day
I always love watching these hard ass randomizer videos because I know I'll never have the patience to do one of these myself
16:29 i like how his sprites got put through a blender and shredded and he just doesn’t comment on it
How do I download the randomizer and connect it to my HGSS
My brain hurts
'Sir this is kidnapping, I am 10 years old and I do not want go'🤣🤣
4:12 wh-   how tho
YESSS HE UPLOADED A MAIN CHANNEL VIDEO
8:57 I don't think we're supposed to talk about him......
I don't know how to run the game on my own. Can someone help please?
I watched this while getting ready for prom lmao
It is a damn good day when a new SmallAnt Pokemon video is published. Love your content man, you're amazing at what you do (and mad props to the mod creator, you're a beast too). 🙌🙌
Thechonk
L'chonk
Lechonks
Le chonk
Nice Video! 😊
Lechonk
This game is perfect for a randomizer, even makes the level curve better
enjoyed the music on this video! insane challenge, small ant big brain
Dude how did you emulate that!!! I once spent 4 hours shiny hunting starters and my game corrupted I'd love play it again without my whole life getting ruined 🙂
29:14, did he just miss that Suicune, or does the pokemon just run away
Nice mystery dungeon music
I’m surprised you haven’t jumped on Kaizo Ironmon, I know it’s not exactly a challenge you can beat in one stream though so I get it.
HELLO
I wanna see someone do this in Pokemon Firered/Leafgreen, those games have the goofy ahh postgame with all the pointless warps that lead to nowhere, the Sevii islands may make it quite challenging...
Looks like Smant’s commentary is looking more and more like Northernlion’s every video
what's the song from min 18:45 ?
Chunky runkey with his right eye injured is painful to watch
tbh. its rediculous that he cleared the game this fast without taking notes. thats faster than a normal playthrough for many many people. i love it
18:10 Ethan: you think you can run away?
it's a Map Randomizer
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.        .!!.
Pokemon SoulSilver but it's the backrooms.
Random map, level, items, team, trainers, and Pokémon is next.
i miss zelda videos... hey can you play metroid?
alternate title: Pain
This is too extreme
For some reason, despite being subbed, and having notifications on, i never get your videos in my sub feed recently, so annoying but i always make sure to check out the channel to not miss uploads, youtube really needs to fix these issues :/
i would've died
I was laughing before, but damn that trendy saying really killed me
Sometimes i forget how god like your content is
Me the whole time: DONT FORGET ABOUT THE UPSTAIRS AREA OF ELMS LAB
A randomizer video, im in awe. I'm gonna get snacks and watch this bad boy🙏
No offense but the thumbnail is fucking awful lmao
I want a Pokemon Randomizer that puts you into random Pokemon games with every entrance. Like a door in Sinnoh, equipped with Rayquaza lvl 82 leads to the mall in Johto and a lvl 4 Ratata in your team. That kind of randomness. Or idc about the Pokemon honestly, just multiple Pokemon generations in one randomizer!
I feel like your voice changed a little 😅
alright I got an ad for a mobile ant game on a small Ant video lmao
6:00 song??
14:00
7:47  how could u diss the pokeathalon :((( it was my favorite place as a child
This would take me years to complete under these challenge parameters. Great video ant. What a stud
How do you use this ROM file, I'm not familiar with it but would like to give it a try
Smallants ability to remember is absolutely astounding. I can't even remember what I had for breakfast this morning.
loving the mystery dungeon music in the background <3
Small Ant? More like Smart Ant. The brain meats went into hyper mode. GG Small Ant
MISSING MOM.
32:14 Imagine a godzila on steroids gets killed by your static rat
He's no ant, he's a frickin monster
This is like studying algebra all your life and going to uni only to teach u about other random algebras
Why you sound different?
your not in the mood ? so no sex then?
I'd bring one of the Latis on an island because it can Fly and Surf. I prefer Latias just because Red is sick lol
MAN GOT INTO THE SINJOH RUINS NO WAY
29:15 Suicune was right outside Erika’s gym and he missed it lmfao
I need to go back, start a new save and finally beat this game
This video feels like it is on 1.25% speed
Great video Smant!!!
I love that the 8th badge was added in the blacked out list an took away lol
WTF MAN.
@MeSoHawKnee 23:07 in the chat—my song buddy! And @mississippi 23:15 we don’t talk about Bruno.  25:06 smant used my comment!
@MeSoHawKnee 23:07 in the chat—my song buddy!
SmAnt who beat two Pokémon games in less than 8 hours  Me who’s 15 hours into Pokémon X and has two badges
Imagine this but with randomly evolving every level, random Pokémon, and can’t take notes!
So keen for more SmallAnt on YT❤❤❤
Wait, Kyogre was supposed to be an earthgold exclusive while SS has Groudon, what's it doing there?
I wish we could also play with the randomizer
28:40 hey that's me in chat
Great!       Now race with someone with this mod
Watching this live made it seem like he was in actual hell due to the teleports in the gyms being randomized; probs on editing down that footage into this video
This mod is the literal manifestation of Rolf saying, "LIFE HAS MANY DOORS, ED BOY"
Are we not gonna talk about the glitch at 25:02
Asks chat to give wrong answers if he asks for help. Asks chat for help deciding the gender of his character. Still goes with chat's choice.
I just recently tried to play through Platinum with the warp randomizer (and random Pokemon too, just for fun) and I was thinking "I really want this for HGSS." so it is AMAZING that this video happened to come out, almost on cue.
Wow I didn't know ant's were so smart
Wasn't it smant's birthday when he streamed this?
what kind of emulator does he use?
Life has many doors, Ed boy!
Zoro from one piece wants to know your name after this video 😂🤣
HGSS is the biggest pokemon game ever made, this is extremely impressive
really love the recent influx of clickbait-and-switch thmbnails
Isn't there a gymleader in the market at 10:55?
belated happy birthday
Piz small ant play Pokemon radical red it is one of the hardest Pokemon game
i was literally eating a croissant as he said eat a croissant. LMAO
you should do pokemon but chat controls the ai
Ah yes you'd bring vaporeon. For no other reason than it can learn surf...
'Meowth is an Incel'💀
is note taking allowed in these kind of challenges? It is impressive that you can remember all these rooms. I couldnt do that without notes
Hi smant
Are you sure that’s why you chose Vaporeon 😳
he HAD to know when he said he’d bring vaporeon
This is honestly a really good way to train your memory AND play an interesting game of Pokemon
Ayo Adrienn from Pokemon reborn?
20:40 thats not why he’s bringing vaporeon😏
Vaporeon for "surf" huh
I recently had an insane idea for a pokemon challenge. I doubt it's even possible. Pokemon, but every time you use a pokemon in battle, it's released after the fight. I wonder how that'd go.
This dude finishes this whole randomized gigantic game faster than i defeat two gyms on a regular playthrough
I am guessing it is going to be impossible if you double it with randomize npc place
💜
Monster's inc moment
all the wrong answers on the challenge is just smallant getting ideas for other challenges
Im very curious about one thing: if you tried to connect to online with trading or battling through the upper floor of the pokemon center if the game would consider the doors you walk through to get into the battling/trading rooms a new loading zone or would it work normally or would it crash the game?    Im really interested to know what would happen.
Emerald kaizo run next?
This man’s brain is huge
smallant actually has the mind of a super genius no cap
Is it just me or does Smant's voice sound slightly higher pitch?
Does anyone know how to patch this on Android?
"You guys always want me to be a girl so I'll be girl" Pride month started strong
I had a level 70 wooper that outsped reds pikachu with earthquake and knocked it out in one hit. The rest of my pokemon were level around 50-57
pov: ur zoro
Can't you upload the Pokémon XD playthrough?
It's great that in-gym warps were removed from the randomization logic later.
Small ant : Yo we found lance😮
I am pretty sure If there wasn't any no notes rule you could have beat this in 3 to 4hrs.
Hello
lol
Him just saying the rules overwhelmed me, I have no idea how he did that haha
5mins in. My IQ is now single digit
Holy 418k views in 10 hours. Good for you SMANT. You deserve it
Hey I just wanted to say that the added little tracker of which badges were located/obtained was a nice touch.
you think this is hard lol try ironmon kaizo that's an insane randomizer
30:17 Wait, isn’t Kyogre exclusive to HeartGold? How is he in this game?
Even in a world of constant teleporting and confusion, team rocket stops your progress for no reason
2 regions makes it way harder. Good going!
I wanna see a randomizer with random items, loading zones and pokemon
Imagine being so misguided to the point where you think the quickball is bad
thank you for existing.
Even from just watching, I felt like my last two brain cells were being pushed to their absolute limits, the amount of patience, memorization and brainpower needed to complete this is unimaginable. Now let's see you do a speedrun of this.
33 minutes of chaos.
stop braining on me
i was laughing at the spreadsheet thing and then i realized id laughed at it before????? then a few mins later saw my own name in the twitch chat lmaoooo i never get to watch u live but ive just remembered i did watch u do this at some point! nowhere near everything tho
Ok now do 100%
who’s the streamer at 13:21
uninspired content
"If you were stuck on an island what pokemon would you bring?"   "Vaporeon" bruh
Imagine this, but with every Pokémon, item, Pokémon type, prize money, all npcs, opponents, their types, their moves, and Pokémon moveset randomized plus the Pokémon randomly evolve each level. Just do pure absolute chaos as a randomizer. Anything else to randomize?
You have the patience and memory skills of a GOD
man is speaking so fast i actually had to check if i had the video sped up
When he said “I’d bring vaporion” my heart rate spiked
When did they hire a new voice actor for Mr. Ant?
guys what emulator is he using?
BIG FREAKING BRAIN
0:26 me to my brain, deciding what gender i think i am today
What happened at 25:00
Doing this with no notes is crazy 0_0
Ur  can be harder… nuzlocke it
what system is he using to play on  his computer
Can I have the download link pls
that was amazing ant :D
20:26 it is confirmed: blue is purple.
i was lost 7mins in, these are such entertaining videos, i love them
Smallant: “If I ever ask for help tell me the wrong information.”  Also smallant: “I think you’re lying to me”
Surprised the SS aqua didn’t have any important rooms or (the boat you take to vermilion after Lance)
20:42 said he’d bring vaporeon because it can learn surf but we all know it’s because its body can morph to be used for “anything”
Hmm. Can you try speed running this? I think this SPECIFIC seed could be a cool speedrun. I wonder how low you and the rest of the community can bring the time?
You’re the man, SmallAnt ❤️ you’re getting me through the flu thoroughly entertained
25:01… what
Pause at 29:15 and you’ll see Suicune
Remember everyone. In order to win you must use drastic measures. Such as: performance enhancing dru- I mean training.
Good video
You should do Pokémon emerald kaizo
Ant you need a plaque that says: "THE ANT THE MYTH THE LEGEND SMALL ANT"
So, Abra can teleport out of the elite 4, eh?
Fun fact: this run is basically a meta representation of an esoteric sorting algorithm… bogosort.
15:14 morbin time 😈
Brain waves been faking me out!
29:15 casual suicune in the top right corner. Nothing major. Carry on....
I wonder how much time it took to edit this
Okay, but can you do it with randomized Pokémon, items, and trainers? Maybe even a nuzlocke.
18:12 was the most terrifying moment of my Life
19:35 that was some naruto sh*t right there
It's funny how the loading zone to enter the first "dungeon" in the game, Sprout Tower, leads to the last room of the the final one, with Red
"don't walk through me, if you walk through me I'm gonna- 🐸🐸*what*🐸🐸
Do a challenge where you have to fight every gym leader/ trainer with the NPC's exact Pokemon. Pokemon ditto challenge
One of the first slip ups I have seen he doesn’t know blizzard doesn’t miss in hail
I was here But I didn't comment much, it was such a pain memorizing it and I'm not playing!
I'd bring Vaporeon "Because it can learn Surf", he says
Yo, did he visit chizplays?
im scared
"Leader Chuck sent out Primeape, I chucked out a Discharge" Iconic, BEST quote 🌩
29:16 he just passed by suicune like it was nothing 😭
bro it has been 3 years since i started watching you and i still, to this day love watching your videos man. keep up the great work, it has been paying off massively man. lotta love
11:08 him forgetting to flip the switch just absolutely sent me
so much battle revolution music in this video, this is great.
How have I never heard of the embedded tower
This is good 👍
i love the pokemon vids
you didnt do the kanto elite four right
Were you eating a McFlurry?
Yay I’m in a smallant video! 6:32
I watched the stream while I had covid, it was epic.
I thought that loose hair was actually on my screen
Hey Smallant, I don't know if you already knew about this rom hack, but have you ever heard of, or played, Nameless Firered? If not, could you try it? It's quite interesting as it's been giving me quite a curveball in my current run
That was BBH he donated to right?
pokemon soulsilver but only the gyms are random
Smallant is the best person at pokemon challenges.
epic
Keep us this content Tanner you’re a legend mate
There really is no limit to what this guy can do!
Where’s platinum map randomizer it came out like a couple of months ago
I fully support the use of Battle Revolution music in these videos.
Somebody make a sensible narrative around this.
“Id pick vaporeon”  …..  “cuz it can learn surf”  Okay ant, sure
smant - beats an entire game with 2 separate regions completely randomized without notes me - forgets to eat 90% of the day
YESSS MORE SMALLANT POKEMON
I would completely suck at this challenge, my memory is basically non-existent lmao
Epic
Now nuzlocke it
12:18 This HEAVILY reminds me of bossa nova in Rhythm Heaven lol
anyone know the song at 10:57?
I really hope someone creates a 3DS Consolizer soon as I'd love to be able to play all these DS/3DS games on my TV with a SNES controller (and preferably a mouse for selecting menus on the bottom screen). I know someone was working on a DS Consolizer but it still hasn't come to fruition. I'll have to just settle for connecting my PC to my TV via HDMI and using an emulator.
7:45   "This place sucks, I'm out!"  Unsubscribed.
"I can go fight all the badges" -SmallAnt 2022
What’s a good emulator to play SoulSilver on? I know there are dozens of different emulators and I don’t know where to start
the lady at 20:31 is the mvp of the video
This episode feels like a fever dream... it's great
rand
I'm patiently waiting for the magic muffler
You should play Pokémon with drunk goggles
„Meowth is an incel“ best part of the video
No writing down?! I'd NEVER do that XD My memory is bad as it is due to brain damage since 1995, so if i'd also not write it down, i'd be completely lost constantly, haha! But the game is very big by itself, so it'd happen eventually, anyway.   30:47 What's going on there?!
Madman, I loved it
"It will miss Blizzard" wouldn't be a bad gamble in any other situation but in the Red Battle there is a Hailstorm so Blizzard always hits
meowth...is an incel.  truer words have never been spoken
Easily my favorite streamer on the site
try emerald kaizo :) also if you do play that nuzlock it it will make it way better
Appreciated.
sick
Got a werster level first Red battle
absolute content right here folks
Now that this has been completed he needs to complete a Soul Silver run without taking damage.
How does this man finish pokemon games like 20 hours faster than me while he does these insane changes.
Ant, it's pride month, of course you can do Brock wherever you want, as long as he consents of course
what if you could combine one randomiser to have soulsilver AND platinum, and you did a room randomiser challenge where you have to beat all 8 gyms and champions of each region, ending with cynthia and then red
So I'm not crazy, right? The mods made him able to fly from anywhere right?
The wrinkles on this man's brain are infinite.
Insane
palkia must love messing with that small childs pokemon journy
does anyone have a link to the full vod?
You should make a video on the hgss map randomizer where you had to go through literally every loading zone
Great video! Adrienn deserves all the praise for all the hard work he went through to create this mod.
10:59 crasher wake in da department store, what will he buy
Rip other people who race smallant in the future. He's become more powerful than we can possibly imagine
im confused how he found groudon and kyogre in soulsilver. i thought kyogre was only in heartgold and groudon only in soulsilver
Can you hear the silence?" "Can you see the dark?" "Can you fix the broken" "*can you feel, can you feel my heart!*" Goddamn nice run
imagine going through the first door and it drops you at the hall of fame
Love the Pokemon mystery dungeon music!
20:11
Kinda sad that Pokemon moders went this way instead of smth like RR/kaizo/drayano. Im not gonna say How some1 should enjoy their time And create content… Just tell me What’s the point of memorazing everything And sweeping with high lvl Pokemon…
purplecliffe we found you 17:33
17:43 the face people when they outsmart someone
I know it's probably impossible for now, but I wish someone made a hack like this of Sun and Moon or somethin'. Imagine. Everywhere you go. C u t s c e n e.
Can someone tell me what song is playing at 13:00 please
Awesome but screw not taking any notes. There's suffering and then there's just lost
did i missed the second elite 4 member? i didnt saw you fighted him in the vid, got it cutted out?
Yoo that guy you got a random sub from is my friend! CrocJohnson
wow
whats the music called at 6:00 ? i think it is from dx or something like that but i can't find it
SmallAnt, will you teach me how to simultaneously analytical and aloof?
my guy's face is slowly descending into madness one after another gym's lmao
That was me at 13:15. I was the random person. Best moment of my streaming career. I talked about it exclusively for the next week. It was wild and I’m so appreciative that he took the time to look at my stream. It was so cool! :)
...Is this video sped up? Ant's voice sounds kinda wrong, somehow. (Yes, Youtube is set to 1x speed...)
Red is a LEGEND. He defeat a man with legendary ground type Pokémon and X items and FULL RESTORE with a PIKACHU. WOW!!!!!
Funny if he went ok no notes on paper and starts marking on map as he did with the stupid comments, but this was also fun!
The brainpower of this man scares me
"Dang it, it's just Kyogre :("
Meowth learned to talk because a female meowth only liked humans
Not even a nuzlock? Wimp
20:49 is weird
Randomizer mod link?
Can rbmgamez get a. Sout out plz
1:35 whats the ost used here
how the fuck are you supposed to bet him in a speedrun
13,000 likes in 3 hours. I would like to reaffirm my stance that you have a cult following here 😂
I couldn't do this
'The Leon challenge' would be a perfect name for this type of randomizer
fk this was stressful to watch lmao
I’m so vicariously stressed knowing that he can’t take notes.
There is something just surreal seeing a pokemon down 30 lvls sweep.
To me, the one bad thing about these games is that the wild Pokémon get to like level 44
23:09 - I guess you could say he couldn’t talk about Bruno…
13:20 I thought that was craftyboss for a second
15:06
Do emerald Kaizo next :))
Johto still the best game.
At the start: he’s gonna get a loading zone and it’s gonna take him to the champions throne.
I really enjoy your lifestreams and I am happy that I can watch the hort videos on yt en plus. Thanks a lot for your high quality content. Your helped me to improve my english skills a lot - you are a pretty fast speaker during your speedruns or challenges^^
12:30
thank you, Adrienn
Good job Smant, this was a fun playthrough to watch.
what was the song during 24:26
What’s the music at 18:08?
sheeeeeeeesh
Legend
Is it just me or does his voice sound different in this video?
SMALL ANT YAYYY!
"Meowth is an incel" - Smallant1, 2022
Smants too good, he made this seem pretty easy
”I’d bring Vaporeon with me to a deserted island because it can learn surf”  Ahh yes, I’d also bring Vaporeon for… that reason
your sprite totally glitched out at 25:00 but no one noticed
Don't offend Karen. She, contrary to the name, is not a Karen. Claire however...
17:58 catJAM
well looks like the delay because pc is off the table.. good luck tho
I really hope that they make the Heart Gold Soul Silver remakes much better than Brilliant Diamond Shining Pearl
This is a nightmare
I miss his Beard.. really nice Video and challenge too
voice sounds different?
is there a vod of this on YouTube?
Let me guess, you streamed this on Twitch in the SwSh category?
This is a Pokémon challenge so I have to ask: Which fossil did you take?
Why is his voice a higher pitch
SmallAnt, what emulator do you use?
Was watching it at times 2 speed, it felt so fitting.
I love the music in this video
not sure that's the right order for kanto gyms, gen 2 should start from Lt. Surge's gym
Lyra has the best hat in the series
How. How does he does this.
i really appreciate the in-game audio being muted while playing music and sometimes playing music that'd play in-game, it's nice :)
I think Palkia had a stroke.
Ant, you talk like you're hot stuff. Put your monet where your mouth is and do an Emerald Kaizo run.
am i high or is Ants voice a pitch higher in his new videos?
What is that awesome music at the beginning (around 1:39)
Wait, why are Groudon and Kyogre in this game? They are Gen 3!?
Why is the male protagonist in the thumbnail if you chose the female one?
With how many checks there are to make gym leaders be available in their gyms, even without the "no notes" rule, this would probably end up being the most interesting thing ever to see as a race.
Funny thing is that Suicune appeared before he found Groudon but he just didn't notice.
I'd like too see him do a mono type hard-core nuzelock. After all he does say the game is too easy
Fight me irl
You deserve all the praise and success you get
I feel like the "no notes" rules is just pain and suffering. Like, it's hard even with notes.
For once it wasn’t AtSign.
Are you sick your voice is kinda raspy and off.
This would be really cool to try and solve via machine learning, a hell to setup tho
What emulator does he use?
Wait I thought Chuck, Jasmine and Pryce were battleable in any order
Totodile gang
I’m play silver what Pokémon do I get
Ah, and now this video comes out. Feels disingenuous.
30:14 it’s just Kyogre  Kyogre: 😢
I would never do this in order
I like how, he caught Groudon, but he uses Magneton and Crobat more 😄
Itsg ant is a legend
AKA smant plays a randomizer while Chat gaslights him
11:57 what did u say?! 0_0
Vaporeon huh
Tanner was really in an excellent mood for this
when was this recorded? i heard panda dropped their speedrunning division
Ants stream layout is so nice and is so clean.
First mod I’ve seen not made by atsign
gg
Did smallant’s voice change
Props to you my guy, most insane challenge possible
i could NEVER do this.. Insane dude.
Randomizer? More like memorizer am I right
What town song is at 18:06
Good job man! Next up, doing it again newly randomized, no leveling, all pokemon random, all items random, Nuzlock! I believe in you!  (If you were to do this, good luck with your sanity man. You'd reach godhood)
This reminds me of the soulsilver ############(no spoilers YT) when you had to wait for a special day (no spoilers again) just to beat up red.
I'm glad you uploaded this and I hope you are doing well ☺️
We love tanner
what did u do in ur past life to get all this pain ?
Why is it so fitting that the last stop in this challenge is the first major stop in an actual playthrough? How poetic of an end.
Man i love the pkmn battle rev soundtrack
“If i go here i think i can get balls” - Smallant1 2022
Was this run before the 2 run you did in versus of after?
this hurts my brain
Ant, if you read this, you should be proud of your craft. You seem like a swell guy and I really enjoy watching your content. Keep it up!
After the patience of the nohit run, the memory and stamina of this no notes randomizer makes me fear Smant once again.
Lmao Im doing some geometry homework to suddenly get called an extra-dimensional being
They said an ant can't reach mind capabilities of 10 humans
20:42  you ain't slick
THE SPREADSHEET
Let’s see some 1v1’s!!!
"Sprout Tower is Red" my high ass: no, Sprout Tower is purple.
Wow, absolutely incredible 👏🏻👏🏻
pokemon and the multiverse of madness
20:33 the sheer horror I felt when Ant said he’d bring Vaporeon is truly a testament to why the internet was an awful idea
I'd love to know the name of the song that starts at 23:21
Ants mental capacity and strength is actually insane
Anyone else notice how he missed Suicune at 15:24 lmao.
is it just me or does his voice sound higher than normal
Fun fact: I started a smallant run. Bdsp without damage
This Mans IQ is crazy
Didn't know that the flurry machines in Canada worked :/
Chat- If you could have one Pokémon on an island what would it be? Ant- Vaporeon because of surf Me- Did you know that Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans to breed with?
3:51 😂🧠🔥
on what emulator do smallant play this game, i walways have trouble making soulsilver and hearthgold works on emulator, having massive black screen/visual buggs etc. Thats a pain, so, if someone have a solution, i begg u, tell me x)
Did he not do the Elite Four rematches or was it just not worth showing? Either way, fun video.
I saw red and gold and clicked immediately
monke
8:57 We don't talk about Bruno
Huge props to Adrienn for making this mod, it's insane
this is fair.
Okay, now find someone and race with this mod
actual pokémon god
Wow chat was such a big help.
Bro wtf why is crashed wake in the department store😂 (11:00)
GREAT WAY TO START JUNE LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
the amount of layers to this. largest game, largest brain space required to memorise the game, and largest group of pathological liars to gaslight you into missing stuff in the game
His brain be like: "we don't talk about Bruno"
I was really confused on how this was a challenge, cause he's done this before, then he said there were no notes.
been waitin a month for this vid
the guys who used to lie about not using action replay codes, are the same guys who are lying about not using steriods
if i had to play this i would prob die before i finish it
Always amazed to see how far these randomizers go!
You should play Pokemon light platinum but before every gym you need to release your highest level Pokemon
Really would like to see another Map Randomizer race!
The hardest challenge is the gaslighting from chat 💀
is this video edited at 1.3x speed or something? Ants voice sounds way off
This is basically like trying to navigate a literal ant hill.
Quick question. are you still planning on uploading the pokemon mods to the discord server? i went to download them because they seemed fun, but it hasnt been updated for several months
When will you do a race on this?
yo smallant i bet i could beat you in a randomizer race
this video hurts my brain
*Pokemon's hardest randomizer,* also known as another typical day for SmallAnt
Small ant Pokémon content is best
Can’t wait to watch this later. Hope you’re having a good week Smant <3
hi
speedrun pokemon to levl 100 is a pretty good idea !
this video is a reminder for me to look into the pokemon battle revolution ost   also smallant pog at 12:15, beautiful
Picks up odd incense while talking an odd tale about a Karen store
SmallAnt: A guy randomized a ROM for me Me: well nothing new Ant is a pro SmallAnt: and I can't take any notes Me: OH SHIT
Ethan is sans
every new smant upload brings a smile to my face, something about the infrequency and high quality, keep it up!
This is already near impossible, why did you do noteless% ant?? 😭😭
Happy birthday ant
smallant would bring a vaporeon to the island he's stranded on, huh? hmm
I love how confused the person who smallant got a sub gifted to was
I want to see a randomizer where everything is randomized. Pokemon encounters, their moves, evolutions, abilities loading zones, enemy trainers. Heck you could even randomize text and names just to make it more chaotic.
This is so crazy. They taken the Randomizer to the next level.
WE LOVE YOU SMALL ANT
Smallant. Breaks down a door “WHERE IS THE JUICE”
for the one piece fans: New title: I try beating pokemon Soul/Silver but i am Zoro!
I wanna see a race in this and I haven’t even started the vid lol
not hard
Hehe
Here’s a video idea: SMO manhunt where crafty and cj try to stop smant from beating the game by touching and killing him.
In the map randomizers, you're Leon being lost in the whole world. *_CHANGE MY MIND_*
i played it 3mins after release, but forgot to comment GODDAMIT
This doesn't just randomize the game it randomizes your thoughts
early
Ant has the best Pokémon content and content in general
Concept: make it a nuzlocke! 😈
Dude, one day the whole challenge is going to be to do this but blindfolded, with Kitchen Utensils on your feet (No hands), whilst being upside down in the middle of the sea, right on top of some sharks, in the middle of the night, and without eating or drinking
Why did I think that I has watching in fast mode ?
So this is basically the backrooms version
The action replay joke caught me off guard
When i read the title, i didt know what the randomizer was, but i felt pity knowing that if Smant says its hard, it’s probably hard
SMALLANT HIIII
It's still funny how chat is basically an additional challenge for him because of how often they say wrong information
He can handle pressure
This and FireRed/LeafGreen (if/when that happens) are Map Randomizers I really wanna try out
Hola señor
Now do it without taking damage :)
Please play pokemon fusion 3  Cuz it has a fusion of majestic wooper and Lord Bidoof
I love how calm ant is all the time
Bruh the comments are so funny. Some guy said he loved the content but the video hasn't even been out long enough to watch it. Some other guy said "You inspire me ant, by taking on the hardest challenges you always inspire me to never give up Thank you" when he hasn't even watched the video yet. Are likes on comments really that important??
Great video
this man is the best speedrunner ngl
I LOVE YOUR VIDS PLEASE MAKE MORE
i liked this stream!      "the one stream that is smants birthday, media share is off. RIP ttttttanner happy birthday" - chat
Wooper
Ayyy let's goo just finished watching one of us vids when this appeared lol 🤣
Let’s go we got another smant video!
been watching the streams of all your pokemon random zone runs and its so entertaining, it really breathes a new wave of life into old pokemon games
lego another pokemon smant video <3
2:51 "Why is it so weak bro" *Gets oneshotted instantly*
Yo
Love your content Smant
I used to have the world record for the youngest person in the world
early
Now that there's a video out, is there some way to download it?     Also caught the stream live, really fun to watch.
Keep up the great work, Ant!
"my mom is not feeling good"
Let's go actually hard Pokémon mod yes and good one
Let's go actually hard Pokémon mod yes and good one
👀👀👀👀👀
Love the vids!!!
When I saw who signed the email which the name was Adrienn, I got shocked because my name is Adrian and there both pronounced similarly
Omg legit just watched all your other ones YESTERDAY, watched all of the ones I could find and was waiting for the next. And BAM the next day
Anyone know a good ds emulator?
Happy Pride everyone
The true hardest Pokemon Randomizer is the stupid trash gym
I've been waiting for this!
Sub 5 minute gang here
Damn I'm EARLY early!! NEW SMANT VIDEO HYPE HYPE
1 minute ago, 117 comments. I look forwards to the video Tanner
hey daddy
Let's go
You inspire me ant, by taking on the hardest challenges you always inspire me to never give up Thank you
bruh this is insane
i love you ant boi
Yay!
When are you gonna do that Minecraft Rematch?
