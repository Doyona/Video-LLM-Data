I forgot how gorgeous this song is
🔥❤️
London grammar gives me the easiest feeling ever
Voice-Angel.
Chwilo trwaj! Kocham to ❤❤❤
super ce groupe
Absolutely adore Hanna and this song.
Hannah doesn’t sound like an angel.  Angels sound like Hannah.
First heard this in an Uber in downtown Zadar, Croatia in August 2025. Had to Shazam it. A dark-haired driver of few words & just the coolest dude ever. Sublime ❤️
Teddy won’t come in he’s jealous again 😂
The sun nostril is blocked 💔
Grammar war eine gute Entdeckung ! ❤
Chi c’è nel 2025❤
This version must be on Spotify. ❤

I do like the west end. Gotta be honest.
OMLG ❤
i don't get this song. It's got 9 great lines in the beginning and then the rest of the song is so bad. Beautfiful voice though... Like incredible.

Mirror bec hart but I am a window so  take yourselves out....when you severed me you said nobody will know but I say....lose your head rather than taking mine without a mirror.....  Bec hart says Simon needs a gag
She is an angel we don't deserve. But an angel we needed.  Thank you London Grammar. You guys are a blessing for our soul.
I think this song was in the movie INGANNO. Beautiful song. But it sounds familiar so I think I heard it in that Italian movie.
Thank you for this nugget. I love this song so much that I put it in my favorite music playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5jEF-kGUoJ2qOBMyhBydpT9TR0rffHMG 💎😍🙏 More than just music: a wonderful journey!

Instead of dying with disappointment, I'd rather a deceit that gives me life ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️

Perfect song for such a lovely series. Great actors, great scenery (Italy at its best) and great music. The story, hmmm some may like t some not, but in total yes good to what in that time of the year! Enjoy!❤❤

U  Because this was not that.  And I've no help from higher ascent  So why do lower make torture walking on earth....try it devil said but I'd say walk my path  If not let me out elite
😉😜
I thought it was 'what a way go to bed, what a way to get a head!!!))"
Thank you so much for this song....😊😊😊
I don't know. Seems to me like too much people pleasing. Hannah Reid can do more with her voice than in this piece. And where are the boys?
I Rediscover this Masterpiece, I had heard on my fav radio in March 21....But it didn't stayed enough times on the playlist..... still Sounds so Good...I didn't see the Video at the time, and I was making my own Images in my head....The quieter part makes me think to a big Sun, with perfect quietness...something close to Yoga!...And then the second part is really hypnotic & so Inspired, with those fascinating percussions. I love the way the music gets gradually Richer.....To end in an apotheosis....Great Art !!  ----- And it was Even More Beautifull When I could Hear it, while Driving in the Country side, in small villages, with old Stones Houses...
I need to learn When this thing called love When it's a mirror, baby Can you see all those parts of me Broken across the world I need to find some kind of peace of mind It's a demon baby When it comes like my oldest friend Have you got a friend in the night  You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead What a way to go to bed With those thoughts inside your head What a way to go to bed What a way to go to bed  There's a place I see it in your head Full of people baby Can you see all those parts of me Broken across the world  You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead What a way to go to bed With those thoughts inside your head What a way to go to bed What a way to go to bed  What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead What a way to go to bed With those thoughts inside your head What a way to go to bed What a way to go to bed  What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead
piękna piosenka ,piękna kobieta❤❤❤❤❤❤
so good, so beautiful......
What a way to wet the bed Im gonna lose my head Im gonna wet the bed I know its in me head
👸☀🌠🌠🎼🎤🎶👑👑👑
I Love you very much

Brilliant song. I'm mainly a metalhead with my music taste but this is something else. Gives me chills everytime
this is mesmerazing
The modern day 5th Dimension. So silky smooth.

what a heart-opening song!!!! my yoga teacher chose this one reeeeeally well :3
I first heard this song in work on the night shift of all places 🤣 got my phone out instantly and shazammed that sh*it and I couldn't be happier that I did 🙃
Her and Ellie Rowsell are like a dream com true.
Love her, no trendy tats that will look lame in the future. NO TATS is more unique and ages better.
Me encanta ❤
❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
For sure Hannah's voice is the Holy Grail among voices.

What the hell happened with this band music direction?! This electro "summer hits" vibe is horrible, please bring back the old sound!
Love much 💚💚💚
Everything  cool 💚💚💚
BBC why have you forsaken me
God this film clip gives me nostalgia for Kings Quest 2, great song too!
I lost my head for this song
Beautiful ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤
this video is sooo pretty, but like the composition is spectacular yet simple and impactful
666 is the number code for love not the devil even though it's the devil's code so when it's wrote on my black board , in clear writing understand you ve been hexed.
This song goes hard, but I go harder.
Big Chelsea fan...when this song was played in our champions league triumph....gives me goosebumps everytime 👏🏼
оригинально. спасибо
Please come to Argentina! Great band!
En lo que llevo de disco me van ENCANTANDO todas las canciones,,, eso pocas veces pasa,,, cosas de grandes artistas 😎 voy a reenamorarme de esta gran artista que conozco de hace bastantes años 😍🥰🥰🥰👌💯
Why is London Grammar not an actress/model?

2022. The Suspect😉

Stuck in his video.  This song means a lot to me this year 💜
2021 ilkbaharında Deezer'dan bulmuştum bu şarkıyı. Az önce durduk yere dilime dolandı yine. 23.07.2022, 19.40
I only know a remix or two of that song (I think one is from MissMonique(mimo) from CamelPhat Remix ) Which is freaking damn good  First time actually listening to the original ... so damn good couldn't have expected less ! Its now more than a years now that this song come back again and again playing magically in my head time to time
😍😍
Some the Lord gives 5 talents, others 2, (some of) the rest 1. And then there's Hannah...
This is freakin gorgeous
Last Tuesday i listen them live in Athens..Just amazing
This is the most strange and mystical song and video I have seen in a long time
A whole new world opens up to our senses!
A minha última descoberta musical. Adoro!
I was searching for this song ,not london grammar fan but i was sure it was her voice !
Fantastic... 👍👍👍😎🌟🌟🌟👏👏👏🥂🍾 !!!!!!!
Great song, fantastic singer but who made this video clip? Awful.
It's so beautiful 😍 💗💘
Absolutely love this track, so cool. Hannah your voice is incredible and I agree with others the video just works who needs CGI!
love this song so much
ama bir video olduğunu yazarsanız rahatlar.
kardeşim, boğulduğun kısmın rüyasına girdiğini söyledi
2022 and this song is far to get old. This is an spirit-song to our generation. I listen, I walk, I enjoy every step under the sunlight or at sunsets of my soul
Visually stunning technically basic.... Totally creative *
Who's here in 2022?!
I preordered the vinyl album and it turned up on the day of my nan's funeral. You best believe I was blaring this out before I left. This song is amazing in particular 😍
🇹🇷🔥🇦🇿

Amazing!!!
Rubbish!!

~°London Grammar your music is what I did not know that exists °~
Voce strepitosa.......TOP♥️
Everything about this song and video is absolutely brilliant - top work from the band and the choreographers
This sing should have been in the end credits of "The Green Knight" XD
This album makes me feel that Garbage has met Tori Amos and then London Grammar has combined that all together... This all sounds and feels so effortless but still so powerful...So rugged but still unsteady, just like Californian Soil
Oh lord. This song is awesome! 👏
Love the aesthetics. So feminine <3
Auch nicht schlecht.Wie immer.
😍😍😍
Just a great song. I am so happy i managed to find it again.
❤❤❤
Now who the f++k are those 795 disliking?!
I've been a London Grammar fanatic for 7 years now. And I make sure  to listen to this very song on repeat everytime before I do a batting session.
Can you imagine how sad the life must be of those who took the trouble to dislike this track?
London Grammar's take on 'The Truman Show'.
Vanilla sky like world. Looks like heaven.
❤❤❤❤❤
theres simply know way i'm the same species as her
pls this song is so relaxing, i love it!!( ◜‿◝ )♡
This group has a unique meloncholy vibe. Suffice it to say her words can keep you in a down state of mind while at others lift up your soul.
love this song !xxxxx
I am here from love Island 🏝
Un très bel album, je découvre vraiment London grammar et j'aime beaucoup.
You ever heard a song and realize why music is so important, and ensuring that we nourish kids learning music in school is so important?  This song does that for me. Legitimately thank you for allowing us to enjoy your craft.
Keep up the good music Y’all. Look after that vocal tone and let’s see more of the boys behind this creativity 👍
Awesome

Wow, just wow!
Apparently this was UK's entry for Northvision. Only if they'd send it to Eurovision instead, maybe they wouldn't get zero points.
Football brought me here⚽️❤
Creative & mesmerizing just an understatement
Amazing music!It reminded me of early AURORA :D
the most beautiful color palette on earth
Hannah Reid could read the nuclear codes and I'd still love that voice! It's beautiful! ♥️
Beautiful!!!
WOW! THE METAPHORS
Homer described voices like hers in the Odyssey. I am talking about the Sirens.
This is the best song ever.. 🔥🔥Reminds me of the UCL final.. Chelsea 🥇 winning❤️nice song👌
I need to learn When this thing called love When it's a mirror, baby Can you see all those parts of me? Broken across the world I need to find some kind of peace of mind It's a demon, baby When it comes like my oldest friend Have you got a friend in the night? You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead What a way to go to bed With those thoughts inside your head What a way to go to bed What a way to go to bed There's a place, I see it in your head Full of people baby Can you see all those parts of me? Broken across the world You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead What a way to go to bed With those thoughts inside your head What a way to go to bed What a way to go to bed What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead What a way to go to bed With those thoughts inside your head What a way to go to bed What a way to go to bed What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead
Is this a song about oral sex?
This song is just a repeat jam
😍😍😍😍🔥
London Grammar. If you ever find yourself seeing the future whatever you see upload a song telling us as soon as possible. I know you can see
From now on I’m addicted to this song. And yes, whoever created this video is a Master.
Divine feminine

I heard this song from the Champions League final, on BT Sport. It was so moving. I remember actually thinking, "What a way to lose it here" before the match. But we won it. Up, you Chelsea. I'll never forget this night.
LOVE THIS SONG....SOOOOOOOOOOOOO LOVELY AND TOUCHING.
Been listening since 2014! One of my favorite bands... and I listen to mostly metal.

Only just heard of london grammar the past few weeks and I’m getting well into them!  as an aside i am in my 60s and really into them ( if that doesn’t sound too corny) 😂😂😂👍
J'ai hâte de me procurer le nouvel album. J'adore la voix d'Hanna elle est juste sublime. Amazing !!!!
❤❤❤
Almost every London Grammar song is about condemning a former partner. I think that Hannah might have a problem with accepting responsibility.
Hannah lovely as always!
LOVE.  ABSOLUTE PERFECTION. SO MAGICAL!!!!
This is seriously addictive💓
I'll remember my days in spring 2021 by your wonderful new album someday! 💕
Thanks England since the Beattles... London grammar has no routs to any references, musically and else... GREAT!!!...  New stuff
Creative beautiful women😘💖💖💖xxxxx

💥🔥
hannah's voice is indeed fantastic, but whichever particular uk dialect she has really amplifies it.   it always has, for me.   certain words, in her presentation, really resonate.   love the song.
Great musique but now that they win money may be they should invest in good vidéo clip !
P
oh, ohhhh, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Love you london grammar
Absolutely...Should do a 007 theme tune....Beautiful voice❤!
This is one amazing video
Fantastic video, the idea behind it is very strong. I recently directed a music video myself... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvncV7LFFso
STOP IT   PLEASE HELP
OMG, dunno if I like this or the remix better!!! Imma just love them both!!!
Great version of this song.

What reason would people have to dislike this???
Vc canta demais mana
If only they extended the section from 2.49-3.12 it’s perfection. Love London Grammar 😍😍
What a different song structure it really works too
ein wirklich schönes emotionales Lied, 😊👌
Epic music.... this will last... im sure of it
It's the first time i heard a song of this band and I'm glad I did. I really like the video and the song made me vibe i like it
I can't stop listening to this
🥰😘🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰👍
she is so beautiful
♥♥♥
Just amazing, I can’t put into words how this song makes me feel 😢🤣😂😍👌
Proper London music 🎶
💓
Your voice Hannah ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️sounds like 100 angels
Do you hear this Jenny Green
Beautiful voice. Like to hear more of your work played on air. Its not played enough.
Yes, Hannah. I do believe. You can walk on water. You can make me a better person.
She looks like Dominika Cibulkova
I'm in love.
Ah, küçücük gemi, sulara attın şimdi kendini, delisin Ah, yakarlar seni, dönmezsin bir daha geri, delisin 😀
This is real, this music is absolutely magic, cannot stop listen London Grammar, thank you.
Класс!!!
Amazing 🤩
Favourite Band
instant crush\
As a drummer, one of the things I always found so captivating about "the old" London Grammar was how they created such stunning music, including percussively on guitar and keys, WITHOUT drums or drum machine.  It made them truly unique.
the best singer ever ❤❤❤
Ethereal beauty and talent. Captivating vid 😍 Just love your voice and your unique sound. Thank you for this ❤️
Angels walk among us. One is named Hannah.
Perfectly deep & beautiful✨💎✨ Thank you!
Not bad but honestly, your voice is magnificent when you really use it, and this didn't seem... Right?
love this band and hannah... she is the worst dressed artist ever.... hasnt improved over the years. someone get this girl a stylist for fucks sake!
My number one 🎶❤
A music video where the singer isn't almost naked?. I'm shocked.
This video proves practical effects can still look better than CGI. This set with its colours, textures and materials is just beautiful!
So good omg!
es ist wie im Lied 'Lose Your Head' von London Grammar.  Ich finde es pass gut auf solche Zeiten.  P.S. Ich liebe London Grammar, ich verschmelze geraedezu mit ihrer Musik.
Wonderful ❤️
Better than Freya Ridings indeed😀😀
Perfect! And thanks for the support! All the best! - Anthony
Hannah's voice has medicinal properties....beautifull.
Wasting that voice on these shitty lyrics and songs.
the video is simply amazing!
More average guff.   Millennials - the generation that have no talent, no songs and no soul.  Telling how all the comments are about the video.  Music nowadays is ALL style and NO substance.
not even from London and also a Chelsea faker
A beautiful song and a beautiful woman. Love LG
BEAUTIFUL MUSIC❣️❣️❣️
❤❤❤
Amazing as always! 💕
London Grammar has been one of my biggest inspiration, and their music is very special to me. I have recently released my debut EP Fragments and decided to share it here as well. As it is my first release, I'm trying to reach more people with my music, so maybe someone will see this comment, have a listen, and hopefully like it ✨
Real dreamscape video. Love that a lot
So amazing ! Loved it ! Thank you joinradio.gr for introducing it to us 🙏
lovely tune that
Love it ! - then again if Hannah sings 'Happy Birthday' I am going to love it too :)
This must've been fun to film
Neat!
In case ya'll wondering where Dan and Dot are, they're holding the these fabrics in the background.
A brazilian fan here. In love ...♡♡🇧🇷
Deine Stimme und Musik ist echt der Hammer...kann mir sehr gut vorstellen das Du und Schiller(Christopher van Deylen)zusammen auch wahnsinnig gute Lieder/Musik hervor bringen würdet...aber Danke für Deine schönen Stücke...
she is on...sea of love
Beautiful song got my imagination running wild💚🍀
one of the best bands of this decade, for sure! remind me of the xx, and also, altough they sound different, another (old) trio: Cocteau Twins.
OMG! 😍 what a magic voice! 😱💜
I enjoyed the last 2 albums because it didn't sound like a dance club music... we shall see how this albums develops
Nice but I keep thinking of this...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo5H62mCIsg
I just love you guys <3
But who gives a shit anymore what people like me think!
🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this is really the best song ı have ever heard,so beautiful
..jUSt sWiM&drEAm..🎼💘🎧🎌🛝
Bright & clear voice, bright & clear sound; brilliant...  :-)
You guys deserve a greater place than you are in, I hope one day you will be number 1
What a way to sing a song 😍what a way to look a way 😍
What a way to make good music
Only one girl can walk on water

Hipnotizada pela estética desse vídeo 💜
Pure gift, this is out of this world....
Trying to keep my head, I lost my mind
Such an amazing song!!!
One of the things I will miss about being alive is music. This is amazing.
working from my bedsheet
Wasting my young years!
cool music video
Sounds more miserable than Morrissey
Visually beautiful,  Songs about relationships,........but whats the message for humanity for 2021 in these changing times, when the world is in uproar, and people going crazy, music needs more than ever to empower people,.. humanity needs that most now, a message of transformation beyond just relationship dramas,.... we need profound messages uniting humanity.
Can’t stop playing this
I love this song
598 dislikes? Wtf dude? This is perfect!
Te amo...sos lo mejor que me pasó en el 2020 y 21 😍😘
Her voice is unreal.
This is wonderful on every level.
When I want to want to leave the world for a short time, London Grammar is my go to. And to think they came together by chance. We are all better off because of it.
Hannah Reid😍😍😍
❤️
Stunning
GORGEOUS SOUND AND KLIP
The color palette reminds me of early Barbie movies I watched and loved as a child.
The Perfect Storm!  Thank you, London Grammar, for being here again.  Ps. where are the boys?
Divã 🥰🇧🇷
Such an amazing voice, on another level to Adele.
I'm not gay but I just adore her! She's the most beautiful woman in the universe for me 😍 and her voice is so perfect. London Grammar is a gift to this world and I'm so thankful for being alive to enjoy their music 💙
Beautiful
Best song you've ever done!!!
I worship at the alter of Hannah Reid..She is absolutely fricking Gorgeous!
So beautiful....as always...like the music in my dreams.
So beautiful 😍
Hanna Reid possesses the epitome of an angelic voice. CASE CLOSED!!
Fantástica Rola Mágicamente Astral Muchas Gracias por tan Adorable Rola.
I'm feeling shakespeares sister off Hannah in the video.
Maravilhosa, o Brasil te ama <3
I like this song, but the video feels like the story of Ally in "a star on born"
Seriously, so good. Like I can not believe I have not heard this sooner. I’ve been working on being sober for a very long time, and honestly this song is pushing me through. Thank you LG 🙏🏼🙌🏻❤️
Давно слушаю эту группу, вокалистка прекрасная , минимум гламура и краски, естественная женственная красота но особенно прекрасен голос! Успехов и больше новых альбомов и замечательных композиций!
Thank you for blessing my 2021 London Grammar 💗
ohh I wish there was 16K quality to fully enjoy that
This girl is pure love.
This is everything I've wanted from LG, the usual beautiful vocals along with a more upbeat melody. I fucking love it. <3
cuba+england! we love LG
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🇲🇽
Lost me “head” 48 years ago.  Cut off.  It’s called circumcision.
Amazing video

Aesthetic music video ! This video deserve more attention cause this  is real! hats off to production team
God, I feel sorry for hannah,  they’ve stolen her voice by working her too hard in the beginning. Such a shame.
the sound and look of an angel
What an amazing video!
Is it even legal to be so gorgeous & talented??
Instant goosebumps 🤗
she would get it.
Excellent !! Le clip est fabuleux...et toujours cette voix envoûtante sur un jeu musical enivrant.... super..Merci pour ces moments d'euphorie intense 👍👍🙏🙏🙏🙏
A beautiful gift to my ears and my imagination.
That deep heartbeat all over the main tempo is sensational in combination with Hannah's voice.
Love this SONG.
So so beutiful and transcendental... now i can't wait to have my projector back and just watch this for hours, seeing and hearing nothing else
Amazing video!
Nice video and song I suppose but I wouldn't recognise this as London Grammar to be honest.
3NICE =]
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL
I SWEAR SİNCE THE MOMENT THAT I'VE HEARD THIS SONG IM LISTENING NON STOP OVER AND OVER AGAIN. INCREDIBLE FEELİNGS INSIDE ME. LYRICS , YOUR VOİCE, MUSİC, VİDEO.. THANK YOU FOR BEIN EXIST <3
Beautiful Song & video  10 / 10
Just lost my head...what a way
Клип очень похож на сон, который мне однажды приснился. Только в нем я летала над океаном. Очень красиво!
My God how this young lady has blossomed...
عيب الأغنية دي انها بتخلص فعلا مش چاست ميم
Voice of an angel 😍in love with this song
Oh wow, what a spectacle... How lovely music and video!
I need to learn When this thing called love When it's a mirror, baby Can you see all those parts of me Broken across the world I need to find some kind of peace of mind It's a demon baby When it comes like my oldest friend Have you got a friend in the night  You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead What a way to go to bed With those thoughts inside your head What a way to go to bed What a way to go to bed  There's a place I see it in your head Full of evil baby Can you see all those parts of me Broken across the world  You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead What a way to go to bed With those thoughts inside your head What a way to go to bed What a way to go to bed  What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead What a way to go to bed With those thoughts inside your head What a way to go to bed What a way to go to bed  What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead
Wow... great voice, great song. great vid... a breeze of fresh air in times of lockdown! I was able to leave my place and dream for a while! Amazing...
très beau clip qui mets en relief l'extraordinaire  beauté d'Hannah
I love so much this voice and music...
This is about Patsy Ramsey and the JonBenet Ramsey murder, right?
I'm not remotely religious but her voice makes me believe for 3 minutes and 26 seconds that there must be a God.
>that scene in The Little Mermaid...
Awesome music
This music video is really creative
Beautiful voice 👍🌷
I love her so much.
It's nice. Though one of the few times that I am not instantly hooked with a  London Grammar song
I bought "If You Wait" 1 or 2 days after its release, I got Truth within a week of release. I have loved the sound of London Grammar from the days of their first single, I love their sound, but this sounds like their first album, like, I've heard this all before, what happened to that wonderful talent? Recycling is not what I expected. Disappointed.
Es excepcional la estética en este video y sumado a la fenomenal voz de la cantante... qué más se puede pedir? Gran trabajo London Grammar. De una fan, desde Argentina.
Me recuerda Above & Beyond con "Alchemy"
This song it's a masterpiece
The visual makes me thought about the blanket by Sasha Shtanuk at Burning man
Hannah reminds me a lot of Malin from Ace of Base, specially during the 93-95 era.  Not only their appeareance, but their sytle and cute stage shyness. Malin also sang in a similar tone. Not to mention both are extremely gorgeous. London Grammar should record some Ace of Base covers, everybody would win.
Pretty sure Hannah has had her nose changed. Songs good 👍.
I still fondly remember them making their Radio 2 debut with Dermot O'Leary all those years ago, ably supported by Fran (of Travis fame) Healey in the background.  I prefer the slower and essentially more soulful pieces they have done, but hey, the world's a better place for having them in it...indeed!
This video is a whole aesthetic <3
It's a song of happiness....Amazing...
Hannah's voice always so soothing yet haunting. And not to mention the music video, the visuals are just, no words, timeless!
Amazing job on lightening in this video!
waiting for homies to leave so i can listen to this.
This is so beautiful!!!
brillant. thanx
Oh look, the industry cutting out the rest of the band as usual, you vampires.  London Grammar's music is dear to me, please don't do this.
More, please!
Tbh the only reason the non fan peeps clicked on this video is because of that dress and colour palette.
Que música veeeei👏
I hope the record company will stop promoting London Grammar as a solo artist... Where are the other two members in this video? 😞 London Grammar is a three piece...
living for this colours 💖
I need an ARTBAT remix or a disclosure remix <3
Your music reminds me of interstellar. For some reason, idk.
Radio 357 ;)
Hers is the kind of voice...vibe  am always seeking ...& can listen to forever
What a voice...wow! First time listening & here to stay What a divine color palette! Kudos to the artist & the entire team
Excellent way to start the year!
Healing song for beginning of 2021 💫
They are unique . Greetings from Puerto Rico .
i though it was yonaka lose your head cover
No way I'm gonna listen this one again( And I really like the band.
very florence and the machine but more kinda chilled vibes, dont know why i think that but its awesome!! Love it!
Cool idea for waves
Ваще Агонь!!!
London grammar rules 2021 with a new banger hit to lose your head!
she looks like a mix from Ariel stepping out of the water and  the fairy from Pinocchio - love it.
Her zaman çok özelsin sesinle ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This band never disappoints me. Much love from Switzerland. <3
How do these guys only have 600k subs?!?!?
ame ame ame
Wonderful MV
❤ for  thailand
Let’s make this song big. Please like the song. LG is legendary. It’s pure talent and voice of an angel.
OMFG THIS SONGGG!!!! UGGHHH THE FEELS!
❤️
Shes so pretty I wish I looked like her T_T
Do I feel the need to comment......Na.....😎
This is the best tune so far from the present stuff that’s been released. The problem, if it is one, is the lack progression between old and new stuff. Or, perhaps only baby steps. If you’ve got a good product why change it? Well, that’s true, up to a point but the most successful people are the most creative and thrive on change. If I were their manager I’d suggest a covers album as that sometimes triggers something in the songwriting.
Your voice like a vaccine for me
Voice of an Angel. X
Thank you 🙏❤✌😘
This album's gonna be even better
The only thing bad about this song is that its too short
All of you are SO TALENTED! This Group is PURE MAGIC 🌞🌝💚🌷 Thank you! Great Energy Everyone 😍
❣️
I . Am. Obsessed. This is the best song I have heard in YEARS
Is it just me or do we have three Major Arcana here? Cool!!
2021 is feeling better already!
God this is perfect
What a way...❤
Florence + the machine vibes
NGL, I like this song.
Thx💙🐺
love you
I've never heard of London Grammar but this popped up in a youtube playlist and I've been jamming this song since. This video is insane
Good song! What a video, best video ive seen in ages, so clever👏
Well thats what i call Art.
She is so beautiful, as is her voice, truly a wonderful human being.
✨🔥✨
what a gorgeous woman with a gorgeous voice
Can you for the love of all things please do a cover of the chris isaac song blue hotel?! this voice is keeping me calm in 2021
Sigh...
I struggle to sleep and your music is calming. Love it. Keep up the good work!
Someone tell me, is she not look like an Ocean Goddess!!? Omg!
My dog, Annie, approves, (She's licking my foot). Hmm, plastic on the water, the fire in the sky.
Magic.
I can't stop to listen this track 😍
Thank you for amazing music. Look forward the new album
Its taken a few plays to get a full appreciation of this piece.  Its a fun catchy song that is better listened to than viewed IMHO.  Play it loud though!
You must to be broken. SITI.
He is not the main. Don't need to be caring his thing.
Love it
This is my first time viewing you music video & I think that it's a masterpiece right from the start. Thank you very much. Sincerely sadkitty.louie@gmail.com
Omg her voice is so beautiful. Reminds me of the fairy tale romantic feeling I got when I listened to Ellie Goulding’s old songs.
Obsessed.
she turned into such a beautiful woman!!! What an honor for us all to see those kids grow up through their art
Hello there! Great great video. I loved it! someone knows the director??
So relaxing love it
The voice of an angel!😍😍
My grandma passed last week and her burial was on the weekend. A lot of the meaning of life has dimmed. Why make dreams? Why even go on when we'll all die? But it's songs like these, that just soothes the pain, even if only for a little while. Life is fleeting, just like beauty. But certain things are eternal, like this song and my grandma. Love those who are around you. Because regrets are the biggest thing.
Epic. devine music.
Hannah walks on water - I always knew it !  🙏💚
hmm go check out the live performance, less polished, less angelic... but perhaps a touch more authentic
“ I need to find some kind of peace of mind” this year as well.... loved Loose your head!
Love you London Grammar
🔥♥️🔥
красота.классная песня.
Que vestido bem lindooooo
Found out about this song on NPR. Turned on the radio after work and it was just playing. Beautiful.
why the video looks not hd even though i click the 1080p opt? i like the color and the song, too bad the video looks poor res. or is it trying to replicate 80-90s cinematography?
The originals series introduced me to this amazing talent and now I can't stop listening to them ❤️
So beautiful ✨
Sorry🥴,too mutch Computer in her voice ,but basically am actually a big fan🤷‍♂️
👍👍👍👍👍
This song touched my soul
Just GREAT 😲❤️

Welcome back!! We missed you a lot!
Absolutely stunning production and a song which follows the landscape as it goes along,nothing here is out of place my only minor niggle would be the song could be just slightly longer as it ended quick.
❤❤❤
This is good.
OMG.....Awesome song, music and video!
My favorite voice since the death of Amy Winehouse. Really a sonic force; she could have hung with the best songstresses in any era.
💙
Nice 🙂
Damn this song is so lovely and soft !
1 million!!!
Everything has became fake in this world, except death... It's time to tear up the plastic bag upon our heads, before it's too late!
Happy Wonderful a Present Good Music a Universal Nice To Love You a Sexy Angels
It'd be perfect to have an instrumental version too 😍💜
great job, as always
This song take me to another world
I got a girl crush
Adore your music ❤️
In love with this new song. Best youtube recommendation. She's a gift ♥️🇯🇲
Need to listen to this at least once A Day. Thank you London Grammar. Great song.
Now we wait for the poolside remix :)
... just .... W O A W 💕
Tnx for coming back  I've been waiting for a long time to hear from u again 💜💚
Great song and I really love the video and music!
Fantastic voice !
Beauty can be a curse. She isn’t  pretty or good looking but genuinely beautiful. How  much it gets in the way of her first love, music, who can say, but it must do. The media go mad just for an ordinary pretty girl imagine if Hannah exposed herself to that by wearing the same stuff Little Mix do she’d have to fight them off with a stick. Talking of LM, some, if not all of them have had face jobs so they look like freaky clowns compared to Hannah. Someone should have advised them better but I suppose it’s the luck of the genes. Even musically she’s superior because she is a proper musician. Hannah should be a role model for young aspiring female artists. Keep away from the media and the paps, keep your kit on and stay clear of face jobs oh and stupid boyfriends like footballers, keep your relationships private, learn to play an instrument. I hope London Grammar take over the world musically as they deserve it. It takes one killer album and they are slowly getting there. This band is very big in France and Italy and the rest of Western Europe but not so much in the UK their home country. I suspect the music is too sophisticated, but don’t change and come down to numpty level
😻✨✨miauu!
well i guess that after all this time they ´ve found that they won´t  lose their mind this way .
Musik in this mood is also. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD_R1KFa1fQ
Curves and waves and voices, brilliant composition!
When I hear her voice ,I have to check the angels haven’t come for me 😀
OMG THIS IS  AMAZING just like every London Grammer song
😯😯😯
I'm listening to London Grammar since only two month but I'm soooo impatient about the new album ! I hope there will be concert and I hope one of them will be in France !

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love this song and this band, wish this track was at least 3 minutes longer!
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. London Grammar or Hannah Reid should do a James Bond Film song  🎥 ✨
london grammar is the type of band that you have to listen to the whole album to really appreciate   their music.
Me when I'm falling in love.
In these tough times, London Grammar keep us going with beautiful music like this
she’s so pretty :)
Pure class... as usual 😌
Not sure about this track. A bit subdued. Love the band, it’s just  not reeling me in.
This video is stunningly beautiful
❤️💐💐💐💐😘😘😘😘🤞
I'm so glad i found out about this song. The colors in this video are phenomenal
Hypnotizing
Everything about this song is soo mesmerizing & compelling
What a music it's lovely ❤💕💕
Sea of emotions. Thanks a lot.
Young & Beatiful simple! and more...
Amazing just unbelievable i love the Voice of Hannah superb 👏, in addition your production level is outstanding, London Grammar all the love from México 🇲🇽❤️
it's an art, smth that cause a blast of pure and beautiful emotions, so healing and unique! adore it
Can someone please make a DnB remix happen?
I feel like I know exactly how they made that set design, but god damn it's so beautiful to look at.
I love metal but London Grammar have been my guilty pleasure for a few years. Bit like my dad with Enya
Enchanting and mesmerizing.
her voice
I like that though no water was needed for this video, I clearly envisioned and felt the ocean throughout.

I'm in love with her voice 😭😭😭 I listen to her every morning and night 🖤

London Grammar and Lana Del Rey save the 2021
My entire life explained in a music video
Love it.
To me it's already a classic! Love you all <3
now u made my day 😍
Simplemente amoo london grammar ❤❤❤
Not the song I prefer from L.G. I think this one's a little bit too common (sorry, I hate to say this, because I like you very much !). And I wish the new album will have at least a song with a sound as typical and sweet as "Strong", or as pure and complexe as "Rooting fo you". Those two, I could listen to them for hours !
They’re back for real!!
great song and video
Beautiful song...Beautiful voice...💖💖💖💖
AMEI 😍🇧🇷
i think this is what you hear when you enter to heaven
This was visually stunning!!🌅
Treasure in 2021
Angelic voice, you give me a fresh air
Okay, Youtube recommendations finally showed me something that I didn't know but really enjoy
As beautiful as her voice.
What about the deslikes ?
Your voice comes from heaven 🥺🥺💗💗
Wow !! beautiful!!
Nice minimalistic video:)
Totally love all this DRAMA. A new Anthem.
Хорошо!
Mantap. I love this song.
I play this every morning, just wonderful <3

офигенно
Best video ever
Es una hermosa canción :))
Beautiful video, beautiful song. I feel like I'm 18 and dreaming.
it,s been a pleasure watching this band mature : ) .
💜💜💜
fans of Cardi and Billie could learn many things about music and art.
I'm pretty sure she sings either "What a way to go to bed, babe" or "What a way to go to bed, bed".
Exactly ⛓
Where is the Dot and Dan?
👍👌
😍😍😍😍
Who else thinks that dress inspired this video?
3:20 Ubuntu wallpaper.
the most creative music video of the last years.
I imagine that this is what angels sound like
Always suspected she was a mermaid
this songs gets better everytime you listen to it, kinda grows on you.
❤️
This song sounds a lot like Jamie XX- loud places   Which is amazing!
I hope Heaven songs will be sung by Hannah 🙏🏼
Sublime, as ever. Love you guys!

What happened to London Grammar? It's all so far away from that masterpiece wastin my young years and that humble KEXP performance.
Wow 🤩
I love absolutely everything about this!
She is an Angel
The cinematography is mesmerizing!!What an ethereal video!!✨💜🧜🌌🦄
an elf in our hearts!!!
The most aestethic video of the 2021
nulle cette chanson. C'est très rare que je mette le pouce baissé que je déteste mais là c'est monstrueusement nul ridiculous  quand je pense que les gens sont malades en ce moment et souffre de dépression. Je trouve cette vidéo de très mauvais goût
:)
Pure perfection, as always 🖤
Hermosa voz excelente canción 😍😘😊🥰
Thank you for this masterpiece, guys. I look forward to the new album very excited.
This song makes me canter flower of life patterns on my unicorn in the clouds.... 🦄🌸
Someone will mash this up with that old Basement Jaxx song... 😜
Anyone else just hear baby shark??? 🦈
AMAZING!
This is an INCREDIBLE video for an AMAZING song! <3
So beautiful!!!
Great way to start 2021, London Grammar are legendary !
Thank you! 😍
I am glad that London Grammar found a way out of the corporate exploitation that was ruining them. Keep at it!
Captivating my ears and 👀 eyes🥰❤️👍
Crazy how similar the music video is to Mika’s ‘underwater’ ,which also has the line ‘lose your head’, wonder if she took inspiration from him
nice very nice
Great video !!  Love it 😍
Love it  Carnt stop playing it  😁
I love love love this song so much
Hannah, you're beautiful.
Why no credits in the description for who directed and worked on this beautiful video?
This song made me happy
what a divine experience
i like this song :D
fantastic song. BUT, WHERE ARE THE BOYS? they did not appear in the last two new videos and I miss them on the cover of the new album. WTF?
Вау!.... Как красиво!.........
Enchanting 💫

Florence +the Machine and possibly Liv Dawson and more than a smattering of Kate Bush=BEAUTIFUL!
Another great song!!!! Awesome.  Cannot wait for more to come, every song is so catchy!!!
thank you!
My life is better due to London Grammar music.
Speechless!  Amazing video!
Seit 8 Jahren ein grosser Fan von London Grammar ! 👌🎧- Ich liebe diese unverkennbare Stimme,mit den nachdenklichen Texten der Songs  - Lieben Dank dafür ! 👍🌹
Loving the new album and this is the best song on it yet. An extended version is much needed
Again heavenly😇
This song is like the light at the end of the tunnel (which was 2020)
best song of year 2021 has been found already
Great song and video! So happy they’re back😍
Much respect. Wanted to keep sharing my copyrighted,  hip-hop, pre-rap, old-school classic 70's ballad, "Don't Act Surprised". On Apple, Spotify, Pandora, Shazam, YouTube, (Napster - in Latino countries), Chordify (to learn the chords),....,download on Amazon for just 99 cents, and the recently released "Key To Our Love, Vol 1" limited-edition, European-released vinyl & digital album, on Google.  https://youtu.be/e6tsTYcftp0     By David Dawkins/ Charisma, of Newark,, NJ. I wrote it, sang lead, & played drums. It's a breakup song, but we got back together & had a beautiful baby girl 9 months later. dawk110@gmail.com for newly written songs. Work with me. Peace!
Superbe vidéo et la voix de la chanteuse est vraiment hypnotisante. Bravo. ✌🏻🌹
Is there a date yet for the release of the new album? I cannot wait.
Wow, so beautiful!
Everything about this is beautiful.

WTF?  Walking on water then drowning ?   🤯🤯🤯🤯🤡🤡🤡🤡🌍🌍🌍🌍

These visuals and song are beyond soothing 😌 Thanks for saving 🙏 my sanity here in DC
For my heart!❤
For my heart!❤
amei!! london grammar nunca decepciona😍❤
Another well placed advert, ohh youtube you out do yourselves..... Sometimes
Who'd a thought: each time you hear London Grammar they're better, each time you see Hannah she's even more beautiful.  Good times ahead with London Grammar in 2021!
It did them bad psychologically go to California. :v
I see the broken pieces...  It hurts me, but I still remain endearing.   Yes the evil is inside,  but it's freewill that feels like knives.  Jumping into the deep end with no shallow.  Reaching for others but being dragged down below.  Picking up so many heart pieces. Now a patched mess of subtle fractions.  Can we stay above in this ocean. And not get swept by turbulent waves and all this commotion.  To find one another. And not lose our minds over the other.  I will always be hopeful.  Because my old soul tells me so.  Maybe we're losing our mind, or maybe we're finding the true signs.  I'll continue to stay afloat, and maybe one day take flight with you I hope.❤️💞✨
The concluding instrumentals should've been longer!
Who watches the video clips nowadays? Well THIS one just blew my mind. WOW. What a stunning piece of art.
Its a little bit confuis
Est-ce que le clip est une dénonciation du plastique présent dans les océans ? ;-)
Música linda, mas acho q o clipe poderia ter sido gravado ao ar livre, na praia.
Sensational song 😍
idk who you are but i liked ur voice😻
At least Covid can't destroy beauty ✊
The beauty of this video just makes me happy 🌈🥰
this is so aesthetic
TOO MUCH REPETITION. OTHER WISH 7OUT OF 10

What can I say ... they're getting better and better.
I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE . BEAUTIFUL WORK AND ACHIEVEMENTS . STAY TOGETHER AS YOUR 3-PIECE ORIGINALITY . PEACE .
Insane Art direction!! Love the color pallete! So surreal!
Finally! my ears missed you
Esta hermoso el juego de colores y el efecto marino de las telas. Surrealista. La música, todo... Sublime 💖
Gorgeous tune! And the  video is giving me Kate Bush vibes with all the billowing fabric.
Disappointing how some great but relatively low-key performers loose their creative edge after a few years. Songs can go bland. Is this the toll of commercialisation on natural flair, or is it just me? I felt the same with Of Monsters and Men. Still good, though.
She gives me a portishead vibe
Hermosa como siempre!
Finally omg! Yusss. Love it
😍 ¡me encanta!
2021 staring better with London Grammar!
2021 has already got off to a great start after hearing this. :-)
This is wonderful. Thank you for some beautiful music!
Christ this live will be a belter 👌 👏 hannah Reids vocals never disappoints.
Amazing 🥰
What a great song and an absolutely stunning video. A simple idea but brilliantly realised. Congratulations to all involved.
If aliens find us someday we have to show them that first. It's just what we do best
London Grammar... Your music makes us to lose our head.
💚🙏
This video confirms that Hannah is a goddess.
nice colours <3
If angels existed, they'd probably look and sound like her
I cried listening to this I’m so stressed 😫 please pray for me everyone
A girl, a dress, a fake ocean - brilliant ❤️
So Beautiful... love it
this aesthetic and voice just thank you
I just realized that London Grammar only have 613k subscribers. Oh hell no!
Cool video but London Grammar songs are starting to sound the same... would love to see more experimentation and variety.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Great song well done we need some songs like this in these times that are hard
All Hanna needs to do now is visit me so i can produce her best track to date.
Their best track to date, excellent
miiiindblowwwiiiiing <3
Crazy crazy crazy
Cool
For me the best song so far from the  upcoming album... thank you!
Awesomeness
DIVINE
Great song but I miss the pureness of the earlier work.
Tiene una voz muy bonita 😍
♥️♥️♥️ can't wait for my new favorite album to drop.
Daymn!  Myon needs to remix this!!!!!!
Can't wait for your album in April!
amazing visual and a great song? thank you
What is this all about  But she can come and dance around my bed sheets
I can hear brian eno in the intro.
a e s t h e t i c
Repetition, the new album from London Grammar!
We've talked about her amazing voice, but can we talk about her amazing jawline?
What a powerful display of artistic excellence! Captured the feelings of the world 1/07/21
Whomever designed, created and produced this video deserves a huge award. This dreamscape using unicorn pastels and silk shimmers is just utterly beautiful, it reminds me soso much of the brilliant artwork that was produced for The Cocteau Twins, like living in a Cocteau Twins album sleeve, the same for Christine and the Queen's latest album cover... All pastel softness💕
Love ur music! Brasil S2
this song is so great, you guys are amazing !!
Un placer escucharos siempre.💖💖💖💖💖
fucking shit your voice is so powerfull, im in love
Como sempre entregando música  boa <3
VERY UNDERATTED ........
OMG this is a masterpiece! Obra de arte!
Yet another band sidelined so producers can package a pretty blonde... shame.
another great song filled with emotions we wish we could forget we had ❤️❤️ london grammar never disappoints
Wonderful video, congratulations to the creator
When is the new album getting dropped ‼️‼️
Elena Tonra and Hanna Reid 🔥
What a way to start 2021. My favourite song this year.
My favourite bands are Muse, SOAD and TOOL, but this makes me feel different. Her voice is incredible. Good
jeez im in love with this woman
Someone thinks she has her voice like Florence Welch?
How can you go from Strong, hey now, help me lose my mind, wasting my young years to this 😒 Disappointing 😕
That aesthetic is beyond 😳
can"t wait to hear this live !
This is pure art
what a gorgeous person, video clip, voice, colors, atmosphere, emotions..
I like the build-up and all the sounds towards the end, but it's not the London Grammar I fell in love with.
Qu’elle clip poétique 😍
The song is powerfull💎💎💎
The video is amazing🌊🌌
Feel like florence and the machine
her dress looks like a nice wedding dress
Oh, man. They are SO GOOD.   This is already my new favourite song of the year.
London Grammar + Florence welch.... please make it happen!
It turned out beautifully and very interesting, it looks like the sea, and the song and the performer of the song are beautiful.))
❤️
Beautiful 💗✨
I can't figure out if this is Dream-Pop, Indie-Pop or Folk-Pop.
Is London Grammar just Hannah Reid by now?
London Grammar are making the mistake that repetitive lyrics mean a good song. Slightly disappointed in this one, as a fan of the first 2 albums.
This is a beautiful song, Hannah your voice is so soothing and I love this video too 💖💯
Her voice.. and I'm in parallel universe..
Thank you ♥
Hannah Reid te amo jajaja <3
💜 Hope
A lot of their songs have this sort of build and it’s so pleasing to hear, I love this song already, what a way to loose my head 🥰.
in this song there are components that are hardly common in the others. there is a very refined voice and a crazy "cleanliness"
So beautiful!!! It brings me back the sense of paddling in a sea..
I love their first albums, this is more popish too me. They had a  mystic style i liked, songs like Big picture is more brilliant. Hannah have more than this in her voice, please dont forget your DNA. ;)
Just love her voice and her music♥️

Is she on the Titanic
This track sounds a lot warmer than past LG tracks. I like that.
Gave me chills. This is beautiful
Master piece.
Song is beautiful, Hannah's got the voice of an angel, the band's musicality is out of this world, SO MANY good things about this song... and I hate to say it, but the lyrical content of LGs songs since the first album or so has been lacking.  Maybe its just me, but when I hear a chorus repeated 7 times, without much variation, it feels like they're not giving me enough content in the song.  Great pop stuff, but I want the engaging content of Strong, or Wasting my Young Years, or Rooting for You.  Those songs will remain on my personal playlists, where this one might not show up.
MFG she’s beautiful!
I ask, how much talent do you have, including the people, who is making the video for your group! 💖🙌 Amazing!!
Astounding! Tears. Beautiful. Truly a masterpiece. That voice!
Очень сильно! Впрочем, как всегда) Супер! Спасибо!
Beautiful song & video.

why the one eyed symbolism on your account picture?
Why it sounds so familiar; because it's the right song at the right time
London grammar is very good for Health !!❤️❤️
He’s gonna miss me now ☝️☝️☝️☝️
Confirmed: Hannah Reid is an angel!
Ohhh 😍😍😍 eres perfecta
LIQUID GOLD !
Wow just Wow. Way to start my 2021 music journey. Eat this pop Bitches!
Come on!! 1 million of wiews is posssible. ❤️
Like before even listening.. London grammar is always a surprise and never disappoint!! These days i ve been listening a lot their songs.. and i was like.... hmm.. i want something new from them! Love this song!!
😍😍😍
My day has definitely gotten a lot better after listening to this.
I like your voice and works... But I didn't like this video music
Perfection!
Incredible. Hannah Reid nails it in every way possible. One of the greatest singers to have ever walked the face of this planet. Her voice is part of my way of life. Thanks Hannah.
London Grammar es la banda que lanza un tema nuevo y me vuela la cabeza de inmediato  Gracias a Spotify los conoci
london grammar is the only antidepresant you cant overdose
Cool video.  I love Hannah's voice. It's a nice track but I prefer the older singles where her vocals sound stronger.
2021 just started so good with this masterpiece.
Leider ein Clip mit Plastikwellen.
Soooooo beautiful
i have just pre-ordered the new album on vinyl - it's getting me through lockdown 3.0, is it February or April? website now says April :(
❤💛💚💙💜🖤🌈🌹
Always serene x
London Grammar speaks the language of my dreams... I am always in the zone when listening to you (so .. a lot!). Saw you in concert twice (in Toulouse, France) and I will always come and see you no matter how many times you perform! I live in Hamburg, Germany now so please come here on your next tour!!!
is this the OA season 3??
I so needed this after the last year. This woman's voice just instills so much peace. Everyone involved in this music. Thank you.
I'm still trying to comprehend what I just saw and heard. Hannah Reid is the voice of my soul.
Amazing!!!
what a treat. love the creativity
Good song great band. Would love to go and see them
This feels like it was written by suits. None of that raw emotion from before.
То чувство, когда от красоты наворачиваются слёзы
the visuals for this video are STUNNING! love the track also.
Yes pls 2021. There is literally a sense of joy found in this song. Thank-you for this. Our souls needed this smile, relief and reassurance that there is more beauty to be uncovered in this year. :) Blessings all. xo from Vancouver
So badly want a Hannah Reid and Lana Del Rey collab somehow.
I am in deep love with Hannah’s voice ❤️
So much love from Peru!! I hope you can come to Latinoamerica some day ❤️❤️
Thanks Hannah.
Brilliant, stunning and beautiful..as Always.
LG/ Hannah have a mysterious knack of coming up time and again with unforgettably Outstanding music. Great start to the New Year for all LG fans.
Qui sont ceux qui ont fait le clip ? C'est magnifique !
that's awesome
🤍
Gorgeous Art.
Thanks for this!!!
LG never fails us, keep the music coming pls
I hear Jamie xx all over the place. Nice tune.
I just wanted to learn some grammar, not lose my damn head.
What a pastel dream💕🌸 💖🌸
Welcome back ♥
Such a beautiful music video
Well, here I am in London, on lockdown, ready for 2021 with London Grammar. <3 XOXO ;)
Lazy ambient trash
Album please
YOUR MUSIC MAKES ME SO HAPPY!!!! THANK YOU ENDLESSLY
One of the greatest thing that i ever found in internet is LONDON GRAMMAR, been 8 years by now as their fans.
Here before 1 million views
❤️
Amazing song! Keep them coming
How about the cinematic view of the sea and drowning ..... Beautiful
Ennivrant, puissant, magique !!! J'adore.
Meu Deus !!!! Vocês sempre detonam!!!! Maravilhoso!
Hannaaaaah S2
Hannah's voice is wonderful as usual . But I am not convinced by the tracks I have heard from the new album. The magic of the first Two albums is missing imo.
Every Song 100%
$@t@nîç every last second of this filth is lùçífèrí@ñ. Seek Jesus while there is still time. God bless!
I'm still wasting my young years...
I wish we would get to appreciate London Grammar's art for many more years to come
💖💖💖
Oh dear that’s amazing
She's beautiful.
another masterpiece
London grammar is way too underrated.
Quelle façon de perdre la tête !?
Wonderful, as always.

A piece of heaven!
Hey guys. Here's a great German review of 'Lose Your Head'. What a great track!  https://soundtrack-of-my-life.com/2021/01/05/london-grammar-rauschen-des-meeres/
it`s a nice tune. but lack of a punch..
Surprised they allowed themselves to be presented like this and the song is a filler. Look out you LG boys, you're being written out of the script!
Awesome an Angel song great sharing New friend here just joined you hope to see you around Always like to watch fw
Que manera de perder la cabeza!! ❤️❤️, mi track favorito del Nuevo disco hasta este momento.
I have the new album pre-ordered on Vinyl 😂
Tears in the eyes. thank you.
better than ever. a fresh start ♡
Jesus is the way the truth and the life. God sent his only begotten Son so that you can have everlasting life. Place your faith in Jesus. Trust Jesus. Jesus Christ. Jesus saves. Jesus conquers. Calvary Cross. The Blood. Salvation. Gospel. Heaven or hell. Kingdom. Sacrifice. Eternity. Risen. Judgement. Righteous. Wheat. Millennium.    God bless all.
everything about london grammar is so beautiful <3
Hey do you like comedy. Do you like memes. Do you like vlogs. Do you like games. Then check my latest montage. It is insane.
1:49 I have the power to finally to feed my family thanks to this here look on the web for *f un da ilyp a y*
I like this better than the previous two (which have been a bit underwhelming to me, especially CS), but it seems abruptly cut, I wished it would go on more. It kinda stops at the climax, taking you up, but not accompanying you back down... The video is nice, potentially cheap as an idea but well executed and pleasant. Looking forward to the album!
Man I can't wait for this album
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySCNE013Q2w
Freeze This Video !
make a "meh" song, once.
What a philosophical imaginery to depict our digital world! A silky and woven ocean that wants to be and feel like real but as soon as Hannah jumps into it, she shows us the simulation and that we're diving into something so uncanny (she looks at the surface quite in awe). She can't swimming nor diving in, she's walking over it instead. The only real thing is she with her siren voice but even so when the storm strikes (shitstorm) you can feel drown deep into the viscous/liquid web capacity and force where she's encapsulated (oily stuff?).  A satined and liquid world, including love!
It's like a continuation of early Bristol Trip Hop and Portishead, Massive attack, Tricky, Morcheba etc I love the simplicity of the keys and guitar and a beautiful angelic voice, it just works everytime..
This is the first song from LG which I am NOT mad about it. I wasn't sure about California soil either but this one is really not what I was expecting.  This new dance orientation in their new music is not what the original LG was about. All their songs get dance remixed any way eventually so why make it such in the first place? About the video. Where are the boys? Yes, we know Hannah's voice and her beauty are both exceptional and are the signature mark of the group but as far as I understand the trio works in a very collaborative way and there is no clear creative leader, which is another thing I like about LG. Is the lead vocal being lured to go solo and turn into another mass produced diva?  The singing is also atypical for Hannah, the sound is very pop and we miss the deep vocal notes that she is famous for.  The video itself has no meaning just a boat floating around and Hannah looking quite overdressed which is another diversion from the original London Grammar image. Plus, the the angel in the end was really banal and an overkill. It's getting too religious.  I am quite late in discovering LG but it feels like that I've missed the best years! Hope I am wrong.
I'm confused. I thought London Grammar was a trio. Is it just Hannah now? Where are Dan and Dot?
Where are Dan and Dom?

Revision 2020-21 Prayer  God Bless you and yours all this Christmas and New Year.   May 2021 be a year utilising the 2020 vision of the last, looking backward with understanding and light, forward with hope and wisdom. None of us are perfect, none have made no mistakes, none have not hurt or been hurt. All we can do is acknowledge our sins, errors, wrongs, be honest with ourselves and others and foremost with the honesty and want of forgiveness we approach Him alone who is Judge and Most High, and likewise those in our lives or pasts, present and futures with honesty and want of forgiveness and understanding.  May Our Father, guard, guide and protect us from all evil, iniquity and wickedness thereof. May he renew, revive and replenish our spirits, souls and hearts, bodies, minds and thoughts daily. May the Holy Spirit and Christ Jesus be with us all always in as much as The Father is always in us, with us and carrying us. Talk to Our Father as if he was your best friend, your greatest love, your teacher and your joker. He is so loving, kind, happy, and so very funny and I know like me you love to laugh and be happy. Lighthearted and uplifted which makes the daily grind less drudgery.  The Word of God states that the only sins that are unforgivable are sins against the The Holy Spirit, so all others are forgiven if contrite of spirit, repentant and truly wanting to be one of His and Blessed, led, sharing in the awesome future and protection and power He has in store for us all.  Seek him as your Father, Your God, Your Friend, and Comedian, and you will never be let go again.   Ask and you will receive, knock and the door will be opened. He will close some doors and parts of your life that no one can open again, and open some doors and futures that no one can close. Lead you among straight and narrow paths that always get you somewhere, or somewhere better, instead of the winding, often lost or lonely making, goose chasing waywards of this world.   He will reveal and remove some people, pressures and pains, some baggage, hurts or drains in ways that make walking with him easy, assured and effortless. People will think your selfish, aloof, alone, or so independent, but in reality your a child of Pure Light and Love, apart of a Heaven, a Kingdom a Future and a Faith that is greater than anything else and will outlast all others.   Give yourself over to the glorified, light bodied, heavenly homed, eternally living, pain and weakness freed future with Him, Our Father, a friend, a funny lighthearted Larakin of light and love that was first among us, has attained The Highest place, has stretched out forever with more wonder, creation, light, life, love and loopholes than any of us could ever wonder or ever think. Start finding yourself within this forever, utilising and appreciating all over your life, past, lessons and struggles, to turn everything to good, getting rid of this meat suit of frailty and hard function to be truly free in forever, glorified into the realms of light and powers, endless hours and endless lives where we can get right what we only hoped we could here, and begin to turn all hurts to hopes and all pains to purpose.  Our Father, grab us all now before we are truly lost in the myriad of maybes and machined mayhems, the million or so futures a hundred nations or notions have in store.  God Bless us all this Christmas and New Year, may the future be His and all our futures ours.  In Nomine Patris, et Filli, et Spiritus Sancti, Amen  Inshallah,  Deo Volente Amen
LoveLight  By candle light or fires burn, I write a poem of loves return. For it was sent away one day, Banished from my tortured soul. For because of evil masquerades, And doings of unjust, It's fight was but a pitiful play Against a boy who to light said "Nah". The light of love was told to go, But fight to stay it did. Though as the boy became a man, Whether physical or of the soul. He knew the light was better than, The horrors he should know. So again the battle waged inside. Tearing, Twisting, Reaping,  "NO"  "Ahhh, pain my lad, does it hurt you, hey.? Does it twist your soul and grow each day as if it has no end, and pain is all you'll know. Well give up you little bastard! You weak and stupid fool! Live a life of endless fun. Sex, drugs and rock & roll. For the other is, A load of rubbish and remorse. Don't worry bout your soul my lad!, I'll always open up these doors"  So back to a life of carelessness, Our little boy did go. Having fun and frolicking with things, That soon shall melt like snow. For the fires burn to brightly, And always engulf their own.  Yet there must be more, More love, more life. But to get there you must go, through a test of strength and fortitude. Before you get a show!  Pain, Pain, engulf my very soul. Rip my world apart, Tear my life to pieces, It's the only way to start. But soon the light of love descends, Through a kaleidoscope of pains. Keep going boy, become a man. And reap those worthy gains.  Ah ha, the pains begin to ease, Teaching as they go. Your life of love begins again. So make the most of it and grow. Don't fall back, into that trap. Of darkness, death, deceit. For the path that you are on is, right Below your feet.  Keep going, even if at times it's hard. And pain comes and goes. Keep growing, learning, loving, And when the time is right to go. You'll be clothed in light, Raised in Love. Then you can Teach Rule and Know, That all of it is because, you had to feel, think and grow !   In The Round  The circle makes the music; In a cosmic carousel. And whe're ridin' almost ruffshot; Through the nearest thing to hell.  Dodgin' cars and scary go rounds, As I saunter through the streets. Past that shooting range near main, On through assorted tricks or treats.  There's that Wire Walk of Wonder, Where you could tumble either way. And those other shoot up centres, Where you might not last the day.  I've seen the ferris wheel falter, And had the fairy floss decay. Yet the carnival continues, For the circle gets it's way.  Forever going forward; Never stopping, when I say. "I'd like to hop off here please, As I have no more to pay".   Fools...  Fools, why should we think ? With just a thought we deeper sink. Or further fly our withered wings, To crash once more, beneath our kings. So cease sad thoughts and fire flights. From which more pain, to tease us nights. Then fear's here slinking in Telling me to dreams a sin. But soon, like salt and pepper's shared, There's milk and honey in my head. To soothe a soul that wants to fly, Through a world with less need to cry. So all you onward dreamers dare, To inch towards the open air.   It's in the blood  "It's in my blood", I hear you say. Well wonder why it's made that way. Mix of mum and dad, and those before, Further back we'll surely find a core. For the word's the order of the day, Coded chaos, you'll hear me say. For it's always been and will be again. To give purpose back and lack of pain. For those scientist's saw the telling signs, Of intelligence, beyond our minds. So look around for it's everywhere, The code of life shows only care. But we choose to grow against the grain, And let flesh's fight control our brain. So hey, It's in our blood for sure, We just gotta learn to use it more.. insha'Allah DEO Volente Amen
ICONIC!
love it

Great! I am looking forward for a remix made by Tensnake or Rüfüs du Sol!
With the exception of Californian Soil, their next album doesn't look that promising, it's totally subpar compared to their previous albums so far. Hope the rest of the music lined up is better.
someone is going to mix this into a wicked D&B tune
I never thought I would say this-The new song suck,they sound like everything else on the radio,utter shajt.I loved every si.ngle one of their songs but now :(
California Soil will be THE álbum
Welcome back London Grammar, better than ever🖤❤️
1:30 *f un da ilypa y* is our reason how day-to-day I get 175
Where are the boys ? It's a trio right ?
I love them so much
yeah, what a way to lose our heads... thanks London Grammar!
What a way to watch this more than 1080p?
The voice and looks of an angel! Love you guys! ❤️
guys... i dont think this is real water
Walking to the future on the waves ahead🧚‍♂🧚‍♂🧚‍♂ Keep on going London Grammar ..👍
Simply adore this band's music, and the beauty of Hannah's voice.
Блестящий суицид... задолбали с этим
ooh upbeat grammar 💜🤍
Was it directed by Sophie Muller?
The end sighs gains some.
Band: We need to create a stunning video for our new song. But everything is locked down and we don't have any props available. What a kerfuffle!  Director: Don't worry! I have a shit load of cling film and aluminium foil left over from Christmas, so we're good to go. PLUS I watched Titanic last night.  Band: What a relief, the video will be excellent then  Director: Uhm, yes?
Do you believe this? https://youtu.be/pYpe_ucYPok
This song cured my anxiety.
Yes!❤🎶
Soo nice!
Wow
Another winner from earth Angel  Hannah Reid and her mates. London Grammar never disappoint.
I love London Grammar. Hannah can sing so well.  I'm disappointed with the mix. Hannah's voice is drowned out by the electronic beat, where is her strength and presence? London Grammar is ill-advised to bow down to the pop industry here. So they'll eventually become interchangeable. Pls. remember good old songs.
It’s so beautiful ❤️
That's my girl.
At 2min48 sounds like TAKE ON ME BY A-HA
i was listening to a nice song and then suddenly 2:23 happened and i was having an out of body experience, thank you london grammar very nice

Goshhhh the video itself looks amazing! It looks so simple yet captures the ocean waves in a perfect way. Hannah herself simply so Angelic and she did walk on the water maaaaaannnn 😂
Falling in love with London Grammar all over again. Thank you for this beautiful piece of music.
I lost my head already, but this band is reading my mind, this is what I wished my 2021 to look and feel like
Angel ❤️❤️❤️🌹
Yeah  indeed  a song  in my head    Hannah  you  vocals  just  excel 😀
Hannah  is a Angel of song 😎😎
Thank you for making 2021 better
An over-produced nightmare. What we feared most. The commercial approach has arrived.
Eu achando que escutaria o álbum mês que vem: 🤡
Vocês se superam a cada música e clipe!
lan mükemmel klip
Life of Hannah
Love it!
IT WAS TIME To hear you BEAUTIFUL VOICE ❣️🙏❣️🏆

This new album is shaping up to be something special 😍
Fallen angel
PURE BLISS ! ✨❤
Sorry, but i was expecting something more strong from Hannah's voice. I thing the song is too easy for those magnificent guys. I didn't heard something new from them. But i m giving  my best wishes to the song
My Muse 🇬🇧
such a bop!
So beautiful, 3 minutes is not enough, please make longer version.
And, a happier New Year with the new album coming soon±
Sounds like an angel, looks like an angel
This song should be at least one hour long😍😍😍
She took my breath away....amazing 😍😍😍
an incredible voice, beautiful words and music. FROM Kazakhstan with love!
London Grammar is back finally! Waiting for the new album. And waiting when the tours will be back. I've bought a tickets to your show a couple of years ago that has been cancelled. Looking forward to see you in live sometime. :)

If there was ever a Goddess, she would've looked like Hannah

Hannah, Florence Welch, and nana from monsters have the most beautiful voices, and could listen to them forever and never get tired of the sound.
Always 😊... Definitely losing my head on this one. My headset wouldn't know what's hit it 😂😂😂, repeat till I spoil 'em..
Beautiful
Come to Brazil 🇧🇷
love London Grammar, simply brilliant at their craft. Whoever created this video needs to be dragged through hot coals.
Yes yes yes!! The harmonic tones are truly Beautiful! Such an amazing vibe🌊🌊
And again the right song at the right time ♡ keep strong
This feels s p e c i a l ✨✨🙌🏻
Algun Colombian@🇨🇴
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 love it
Even the most troubled water cannot carry away Hannah Reid.
I like it 🥰
London grammar has become different, it's not bad, but.. I can't take it.
OMG BOP 😍
Cool video. Nice song. And Hannah is just beautiful.
these guys are god level good
Can’t wait to hear the full album!!
I love this MV and the instrumental towards the end
Absolutely stunning, from head to toe.. The silk turning reminds me of a reaccuring dream I used to have, if this She was there I'd Pleaded for Acoma!!!  Is it just me, definitely something Magical this Lady 🎼🗯️💙
I'm so happy that they're back!
Her voice is so beautiful.
I already lost it
I'm going to lose my head waiting for this album to drop. This is beautiful.
💧
Poxa, que cenário show. Perfeito! Sem falar da performance com um a belíssima interpretação. Plausível!
Am I terrible for saying they are losing it - regurgitating riffs, polishing base metal til it shines where we used to find gold and diamonds. Oh well.
Amo vuestras música 👏😍😍😍😍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Every one of my favorite colours 😍
Listening to London grammar prevented me to kill myself
I need to learn When this thing called love When it's a mirror, baby Can you see all those parts of me Broken across the world I need to find some kind of peace of mind It's a demon baby When it comes like my oldest friend Have you got a friend in the night  [Chorus] You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead What a way to go to bed With those thoughts inside your head What a way to go to bed What a way to go to bed  [Verse 2] There's a place I see it in your head Full of people baby Can you see all those parts of me Broken across the world  [Chorus] You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head You say you miss me now What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead What a way to go to bed With those thoughts inside your head What a way to go to bed What a way to go to bed  What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead What a way to go to bed With those thoughts inside your head What a way to go to bed What a way to go to bed  [Outro] What a way to lose your head What a way to lose your head What a way to go to bed What a way to get ahead
Mental level of excitement ❤
Video - Is - Everything!!
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Loooooove this 🤩🤩
They’ve made a perfume advert
Quarantine videos have been quite poor but this is the exception.
Another beautiful song
Hannah é muito linda e que voz. Essa música ficou muito foda, já ficou na minha head. rs 🇧🇷🇧🇷
It's really amazing how their songs can change our mood, thoughts and emotions
This 👏🏼 is 👏🏼what 👏🏼 I 👏🏼came 👏🏼here👏🏼 for!👏🏼
Love the slightly up tempo track. Still with majestic vocals from Hannah. I can't get enough of you guys. Thank you for the beautiful music. ❤
Amazing Amazing 😀✨🎶🙏
When things go back to normal...come to 🇬🇷 ill be waiting
Wow this is truly stunning and just what we  needed after today’s lockdown announcement
🤎
The most underrated voice in music today! She prefers it that way!
So beautiful...the music is good too ;D
I’m losing my head ❤️
Mesmeric. Thankyou Dot, Dan and Han ❤️
Can’t wait the album 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Incredible
The song is so fresh but still so London Grammar.  And the video, WOW.   I'm gobsmacked by how simple yet so complex it looks.  Stunning.
Hermosa como siempre, una obra de arte en pleno esplendor, I'm in Love with u ♥️
The color palette in this video is amazing.
beautiful 💘 , love you 💗
I woke up to this video.. wow.. ♥️
I AM LOSING MY HEAD OVER THIS RELEASE
I love it
Hannah...you're so beautiful
Wake up bro, London Grammar just dropped
Appreciating this video with every watch – it's got this luscious, dreamy quality that carries you on silky, undulating waves (and Hannah's golden voice) to another world, away from the weird, sad one that we're living in now. Magical.
Wow, the lyrics and the voice execution is👏❤
All alone drowning in an ocean. An accurate representation of 2020.
Freggin awesome 🥰
Right gas 👍🇧🇸
Oh man....HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU🥰🤩
Initial release missed by a few hours ...   doesn't matter    beautyful Song and Video - and woman 😍  Happy New Year   to  All
Son: Dad, why is my sister's name Rose? Dad: Because your mother loves roses. Son: Thanks, dad. Dad: No problem London Grammar - Lose Your Head (Official Video)
Where are the boys??? No, for real, this video is so peaceful and soothing. The colors are amazing. Love LG soooo much! ❤️
Love this band since first record. They are great. I still have goosebumps when a new song is out. They still have, or at least i still feel, that vibe from their first records. ❤️
Awesome.  Nuff said.
i love this sm
Ah! Beautiful!
waiting for the Kolsch remix
Love it!
Cannot wait for the album❤️
Not got a hook for me sorry. My mind wandered.
The last two singles were complete trash and this one is like 30% better... slim chances we gonna get a bomb album like the first two .. shame
❤️❤️❤️
No entiendo ni madres pero me gusta mucho su música , su voz 😊
I still miss the mezmerizing vibe from the very first album... can't find it back anywhere among their new songs, despite they sound good
Truly love the first two albums but the three songs from this new album just haven't done anything for me. This and Baby its you are just club style dance songs and not great music like the freshman and sophomore albums. Hoping in 3-4 years their fourth album will return to their greatness. Hannah is an incredible singer, but these new songs don't honor that, these are just pop and forgetful. Too much repetitive lyrics, no soul.
So beautiful. The track, the video. I can't wait for this album!!
impressive
Very good.
Dreamy...
Love you so much 💔
I love that holo, pastel vibe.. It suits the song perfectly
You are always the best. Thank you from the bottom of my heart..and I wish you a happy new year. Thank you......😇😇😇
👑
Is it me or she looks like fashion designer Chiara Ferragni ?😅
1:24 OMG QUE INGENIOSO Y HERMOSO! 💕💕💕💕
Loving this new song from London Grammar?  Come join a growing fan group at:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/433054440586374
I admire them for trying a new sound so in the beginning it will be hit or miss before they find what works and wish them luck. What am worried though is that they relying on Her Natural Beauty as previous videos was minimum visual time on her Maximum time on the song . I think Californian Soil is a better song IMO .
👍🤘👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Amazing! Like everything you guys do! So excited for the new album. 🥂
Mesmerizing
This is very London Grammar and I love it
Beautiful
Worried about the quality of the third album, so far only californian soil is reaching the London Grammar of the first two albums
Magnifique comme d'habitude
I can already tell this album will define my 2021.
I've said many times I'm too old to like this band but I love them. Lush sound and song crafting is always in style.
The evolution of London Grammar continues, thankfully with the voice of Hannah Reid unchanged. Best there is.
Divinely guided 💜
Divine voice 💓💓💓
Some vapor wave vibes here, and Hannah‘s voice... my goodness.
I love itso much. Can't wait for the New Album
I find London Grammar’s music so calming.  They help me to cope living with the severest form of chronic pain and multiple health conditions at 28.  I came round from surgery in total agony and the nurses asked me what music do I enjoy listening to? I immediately said London Grammar and they played it to help settle me, it helped hugely.  Thank you London grammar, I’ll continue to listen when I start to struggle. I adore this new song as much as the rest 😊
Juste magnifique Je continue de te suivre
This band is like everything, I hope to see them in concert
Seems that all is good with London Grammar.  Same art as always but with stronger roots into its own world. Ammmmazing! Very good song. Feels like kinda  almost goes to the 4 pop chords but it delevers the joy without it. How??? How??? :)  (Synth lead at the end: dangerous (!) a bit I guess ..but who the hell I am. :) )  Love ya guys! Top song!!  It will be. Just gets into you. Can't escape it.
First time listening and I'm literally crying like a baby
They will come back to TOP 10 !
Tienen que venir a Argentina!!!!
I like this song very much... love the dreamy atmosphere... perfect at the sea... thank you guys! Love you London Grammar
Who 👏 directed 👏 this 👏 video?!!!
I've never seen something this beautiful ! The music, the coulours, the lights, the motions... the whole thing is magical ! Really really proud of you LG. I can't wait to be able to see you live again ! Please let it be very soon <3
Everytime you release a new track it intoxicates me. This is no different, it's beautiful
Świetne ! Zresztą jak zawsze 😊
Imagine this is yet another generic, unoriginal and cliche "funny" comment that will still receive tons of likes anyway.
sad really when they were a trio  you saw all 3 .and the sound was raw....and now in the hotel California they are trapped ....refined remolded into the CEO's imagination ...JUST HER....no need for the 3... sad..... I hope they will see that they as a whole sounded way better ...dont lose that soul..
Beautiful, as always.
Only one word needed.....................WOW
Very simple idea and so beautiful in its simpleness👍I am always happy about smth done with no VFX
somehow, in 2012, I heard a remix of the London Grammar band! And 9 years have passed, and I am waiting for new songs more and more of the previous ones! I agree with the comments above about Hannah, but we have to admit that everything is like that and the music, after all, this is a group and the guys are one of the pieces of the cube that we can't throw out! thanks for being there!
Just ✨✨✨
Как же красиво💜
Qué mujer más hermosa y que increíble es su voz!!!
I am ready to lose my head for the new album?  Yes
Ooh yay a birthday present. Reminds me of the time I got to see them perform at a small venue back in 2017 on my birthday as well.
love
I am so impressed how this song went from quiet to a storm without it sounding like a mess, just to return to the quiet. What a fantastic video to accompany the song
She’s heavenly sent ❤️❤️
The visuals for this music video were very creative. Kudos to the director, cinematographer, and set designer on this video. London Grammar is like if a first rate operatic singer met with instrumentalists who truly respected the musical sensibilities of the best of 80s pop. The synthesis of these two elements produce music that is both haunting and very catching.
As much i love her angelic voice, this song lacks good songwriting.
eu te amo demais 🇧🇷❤️
It's illogical to lose one's head... No one's worth it!!! Yawn, so boring
Gosh she's so beautiful and talented !
I  pressed the like button before I pressed the play button...
what a wonderful video!
❤️
Love
Pure art. 2020 wasn't that bad after all, and 2021 looks awesome. Ily guys
OMGGGGGGJDBDJSLAKBABSBSBSBSBSBSIXJDBBB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YEYEYE <3 omggggg most beautiful woman ever
What a beautiful new years gift. Thanks London Grammar! All the love! ❤❤❤
Awesome tune - this needs a Deeeeep House remix STAT!
this is so beautiful ♥️ love it so much ♥️
Her music is so strong, it makes me believe the fake sea is an ocean full of diamonds!
Lost in a sea of thoughts. What a way to lose your head!
Oh fck 😍❤️
A glow female JC of contemporary 💛
Sad now... Far far away from the first album. I hoped they go back to the roots. This sounds very mainstream.
so happy i love london grammar so muuuch
The instruments in this song are so different from LG's past works, I really love this
wow... what a great video idea, the look.... cool
That "water" looks so cool.
Ahhhh yes voice of an angel 😍 She’s so gorgeous!
Обожаю ваши выступления!!!
Those three singles legit confuse me, because I don't know what to expect. I'm both: scared and excited.
fantastica
Girl the aesthetic 😍 obsess with this song and this video
Simple concept gorgeously executed.
What a beautiful voice and incredible melody...Thanks for this song
Nice video. Banal song. No ostensible connection between the two.
🌟🌝🌟
I don’t dislike it … but it’s not at all what I was expecting from London Grammar. Trying new things is good in music… but I do hope the rest of the album is more like the other two singles.  The vocals are great as always, although more repetitive. The background sounds more like the radio edit of Strong from the first album, which is the only track on that which I do not have saved. Beats like that do better on the radio, sure, but they feel more cookie-cutter and less original.  It’s a good song, just not “London Grammar good.”
🙏🇵🇹
god, i love this band so much
👏 awesome 😎
strong composition !
So-So... ( ну такое...)
Beautiful! 😍💟🔥🎞️🎥🎼 A big hug from Argentina! 🇦🇷
Shiver me timbers!
Already lost it mate
Thank you London Grammar for this masterpiece. We've all needed strength to get through last year and this symbolises it perfectly. Great song to see the new year in. Hold on tight everyone. ⚓🤍
sehr schönes Video und wunderschöne Musik🌊💗🌊
I love London Grammar but I find this a little disappointing.  Lacks the depth and soul of their previous masterpieces.  However I haven't heard the whole album yet. But I hope they return to  form.
This band produces gold 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Топ👍
Very clever concept and beautiful video...London Grammar best video yet
Incredible!!!! The best Music and Band of our Time !!! With lyrics to think about !! Thank you London Grammar ❤️
Hannah looks amazing. Very meh song unfortunately. Too short, too repetitive, too commercial, too bland. Similar to the previous two singles. :( Sigh.
The sound of the first verse reminded me of the beginning of “dolerme” by Rosalía
There are nobody else like London Grammar and thats a compliment.
Damn, what kind of fans does she use ?
sounds more commercial now, I liked their older stuff better
Beautiful ♥️
I lose my body
I can't wait for the remixes!
Impressive.
London Grammar just have this ability to reach inside you, touch your heart and caress your soul - Every. Time. We are so blessed to have you! ✨
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Visuals are just breathtaking.
Sa voix transperce, fait vibrer et touche de la tête aux pieds, depuis leur début, une seule note suffit "-) Merci !
This is the best low budget music video I've ever seen.
Sounds a little bit like some from Dido but much much better!
Kaboooommm!!!!
Beautiful.This video is like a live panting.♥️👏👍🖐😁
bring on the new album!!! I've loved every song so far, and this music video is stunning <3
Pure class as usual. Love you guys x
Am I sensing a new concert end song with some amazing Dot drums part?
if you had to choose between only hearing OR seeing hannah.. what whould you choose? like DAMN thats a hard choice aint it
Can't wait for the new album to arrive
I was not ready to have such chills and goosebumps while watching and hearing the song. I knew something bigger was coming before the album and I can't wait to hear it in full. Well done.
🥺❤️
One of the few bands that to me, could never make enough music
Always worth the wait ... Just amazing
Is this a real set? Woh!
I love you Hannah❤️❤️
🤩😍
Ok, this was meant to be Dry Monday on the island in Scotland. Now I'm streaming LG non stop (including this new delight) and breaking out the homebrew India Pale Ale. My 2 CDs are ready, with the speakers connected to the headphone jack...
Prefer this to California Soil, and I like the introduction of heavy synths towards the end of the track. Looking forward to this one, though I know it can't and won't top Truth, not for all the moments in my life that that music has accompanied.
Ну это волшебно, впрочем как всегда😍
good
Wonderful song, dreadful video
Incredible...enough said.
love you
brilliant track again. can' t wait for the new album and hopefully live concerts to come
yesss
Always worth the wait!
This aesthetic is too much for my heart ✨😍
The first new song and video in 2021 to leave such a great impression.
Maravilhosa! Fantastic! Brazil love you.
I love you, guys ✊👏
IN LOVE
The BEST BAND ever! Love u guys!!!!! Keep going like this!!!!!
This is so fkinggg beautiful !!🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍
Mesmerizing!
Thanks for the birthday gift!!!!
She is beautiful great voice as well
It's a good sign that i wish all these new songs were a few minutes longer each.
Woww insane!🤩✨ So beautiful, and inspiring. There is no single of London grammar that i hate .congrats from France🇨🇵
Is it just me or did YT compress this video so much it looks like it's 360p?
😍💞🙏💞🙏💞🙏💞🙏💞😍 Thk uuuuuu! MILLIONS!
Thank u London Grammar for making my 1st favorite 2021 song happen, this song is awsome y  epic, its like one of those good vibe songs you hear like only three times in a lifetime, greetings from Lima Perú, happy new year 2021🌈🎆🌹❤
pure, raw talent

Brilliant  , great voice great band .✊🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
London Grammar inspired every song I ever made
I'm waiting for you to come to Costa Rica🇨🇷 London Grammar, and I'll wait a thousand years ❤️
Just because you ask me to.
Hannah is such a mood 🙌🏾😍
This is the artist I am most thankful for being able to witness in my own lifetime
Artists like these remind us of our own potential as a species. Helps in times like these. Glad my French niece turned me on to this group! Great expressions are borderless...
One word ; Magic !!!
The best first Monday of the year ever 🤩
i was waiting since 6:30pm for this wonder :) thanks london grammar
✨🥺✨
Love the synths, love the vibe, love the visual, Hannah is so so so pretty <3

this is beautiful
omg this is beautiful
Love ❤ it's beautifull ....
perfeito!
This sounds quite different from what they've been doing all these years. It's nice that they're trying out new stuff in this album. And this video looks stunning! Great song too!
London Grammar just hits different. Still waiting for the day they bring out a song that I don't immediately fall in love with 😂
A little more guitar work with a couple of transitions are missing overall, that said, Hannah is So beautiful and extremely talented along with the most magnificent voice in the game.
Literal goosebumps
As good as Ever 🎶🎵🎶🥰
Love it! You look and sound beautiful! 💙
Magic

Please, give me more of this.
thanks! you are everything to me ♥️♥️🇧🇷
my heart simply can't take it OMGGGGGGG fucken love itttttttt OMG OMG OMG
Omg finally 💙 İ love LG family <3
Hola ingleses y sajones 🙂
This is too good for words. Amazing work out doing yourselves once again
I feel like angels are singing to me when I listen to London Grammar.
Omg I can not wait for new album 😍😊 so happy and feel so privileged to have met all you guys, you are my number 1 artist's
LG Family^^ I lost my head the first time I saw her. quand je l'ai vue pour la première fois, j'ai perdu la tête.als ich sie zum ersten mal sah verlor ich mein kopf
Brilliant
The three fold heart flame, soul of violet. Snake bearer equals Aquarius🌟
god i missed that voice
LG appears to be New.. New Wave.. and Hannah reminds us.... she walks on water!!
The best 3 minutes and 25 seconds of 2021 so far
London grammar will never get old or irrelevant. They are timeless.
good one.. i like
loved every second
Beauty ❤️
Thanks for coming back 😌 I’m a big fan of the last album and I juste love the new songs ! your voice is amazing and the lyrics are so meaningful ... thank you and bravo
Hannah like beautiful mermaid , charmingly 💓
This is probably my favourite song since ‚Hey Now‘, I love it so much 🥺💖
isso tá tão perfeito que deveria ser passado no museu do louvre
Colombia!!!! Me encanta la voz de esta mujer.
Lana del Rey, Florence Welch and Hannah Reid
Beautiful 💜
Amazing song, amazing video💙💙💙
Love the iridescent vibes of the video =D
Perfect.
woooow this is amazingggg
Is it just me or do the songs on their upcoming album sound way too overproduced? I much prefer If You Wait and especially Truth Is A Beautiful Thing where Hannah's voice is the star of the show :(
First listen, very sweet, simple, too short. Second listen, beautiful, but still short. I shall listen to it further and I know already it will become an earworm. Now for the album!
Finally you show your sexy side  ! 🌹💖
tune after tune!!!! so glad you guys are back! best band ever!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Here for this! <3
Hannah andando sobre as águas.
Bruh she always uses echo and shit auto tune.
Oh my this song is hitting my soul right now! I love her so much! 😍🥰😘
When I hear their music I feel like in another world and I feel so light like flying💓
she has a voice like a poem 🤍
Hermoso!!! 💗💗💗
2:44 onwards - caught that New Order vibe.
Ela lembra muito a Lana Del Rey
Depuis 2013 je ne peux me passer de sa voix
❤️
Wonderful video! I adore it!!!
One of those bands where you don't need to hear it to know you will like it.
Back then London Grammar was a little Gem .. today BIG Show  lala with no Soul .. No Thanks
Everything about this ❤️ I’m blown away...
Peace of mind is equal to London Grammar's songs
That's one hellova dress
This visual formality is beautiful
It's a very British title
OMG! Amazing... The rip tide vibes or Imenjá 💙💖💜
Love this!
🌊
I LOVE YOU HANNAH ❤😍
Sorry, but i was expecting something more strong from Hannah's voice. I thing the song is too easy for those magnificent guys. I didn't heard something new from them. But i m giving  my best wishes to the song.

AAAAAAAHHHHH
What a beautiful melody to start 2021 with! LG❤️❤️❤️❤️
What a great song. ❤❤❤👌🏻👏🏻
beautiful music video, beautiful voice, beautiful woman
Awsome London gramma
Interesting. Definitely more pop style than their previous work. Wondering if they have changed producers?
talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.
In love with her. <3
Just one more month till the album is out 😭😭
Great song! 2021 has just begun, and things are getting better already! ;-) Looking forward to the new album!
Magnifique ❤
Is a god song.  But i miss the sad and vocals songs

Wow can we just see this awesome song but once I hear it I don't know it will be my favorite song
Hannah Reid is life 💗
I'm a simple man. I see London Grammar I press like
Listened to the album yesterday, great track.
I like what I see. <3
Can't wait ;)
Pressing like cos I already love it without hearing a single note =D
Already love it lol. I feel like this album will be a bit more glamorous based on her styling and Californian Soil video, and will have more experimental sound on it. I already love it.
Mi hermosa Hannah 😍😍
Hannah Reid has the most beautiful voice ever, loved seeing her live in 2018... Hopefully I will see them again soon...
London Grammar in 2013: Help me lose my mind London Grammar in 2021: Lose your head
Woah this looks good
Can't wait :)
London Grammar about to come back with another great song. I can’t wait for the album!
