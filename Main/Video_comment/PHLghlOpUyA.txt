Hey Chaps! What did you make of the iPhone's footage for filming this video? Reckon I should chuck my A7Siii in the bin? 😅  Update 1: ProRes is coming to all Pros, but only 1080p for 128gb models  Update 2: happy to hear Apple will soon add a lens lock feature so camera doesn’t keep switching between wide/UW
2:15 what game is that
What about screen issues with 13 pro max?
“I wish the 13 pro max was smaller.” 🤡
Is it worthy to buy it in 2025
I am still using this phone, pro max . The quality and sharpness of video is better than the iPhone 15 pro max!
Pls I want to by it ,how much am in Kaduna/Abuja Nigeria
muy buen contenido
👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿
Thanks for the video,you helped me to make a choice of 13 pro max as I love apple.kindly tell me the title of the games you played while reviewing the iPhone.all the way from South Africa.
the 120hz sucks on the 13 pro max and its laggy in games
Hello sir, can you gift me an iPhone, I am from India and I belong to a middle class family, I can never afford an iPhone.🙏🙏
Great video as you were gonna say “I’m transitioning” 🤣🤣🤣all jokes aside but from a 7 plus to a 13 pro max. It’s a major upgrade on my end and it’s within my budget I have my 7 plus almost 4 years naw I had an 11 it broke and I had to go back to my 7 plus. It’s amazing if you ever get a chance to go back too a 7 plus you can’t update but even with all the latest social media apps and games you could get. So for a young’s it could be good then you’ll have to worry about them wanting the latest one because everyone at school has it🤣🤣🤦🏾‍♂️😁
My dreams phone I phone 😢😢
If your doing a lot of video work gotta go for the biggest scream possible + battery increase,  the max, 6.7 inch screen is best
the forth time i get a Samsung  ad on an iPhone video
Hi What is That Drone Game Name ?
Iphone 13-pro-max 🔋🔋🔋👑📱👍😁
Nice phone but only if you can afford to spend big dollars. If you only used it as a phone function , call , sms , google , gps …. And acceptable quality photo/video then any others phone will work fine and save you thousand dollars for other things you may need . Personally I don’t see why we should paid over $2000.00 for a phone ( iphone 13 pro max in Australia will cost up to $2500 .00 depend on storage)
Excellent presentation that looks like a live TV coverage. By the way, where was this  beautiful village  taken? Compliments to your clear, creative, and colourful narration. The British accent is so cool and clean ! love it.
I got the same exact same phone as you have lol
And I bought the 13 pro max as I just need the extra battery life for my long cycling rides. A bit big as phone but great. And price , now in 2023 better than iphone 14 pro max
I have to say after the 11 pro max I just didn t care about the android, had the 12 pro max and now stay with 13 pro max. They have all the features I meed and amazing battery. The most important thing, it just works. So no more  samsung freezing or not having the snapdragon, as far as pixel, after the 4xl the rest…..even the 6 pro that I tried, no chnace.
Just got the 13 pro max. Need a big screen. Getting old eyes 🙄
Cinematic mode... cinematic mode... well I will just have to work with the limitations of the iPhone11. or maybe buy another one ....
If you'r reading this I hope you're having a good day
Still have mine till this day and I’m still happy !!! This is the first time I’ve kept a phone over a year the battery life is still amazing!!! So is the camera and performance!!! I’m gonna hold on another year and see what the 15 series offers
Loved the video. Watching this on iphone 13 pro max and this device has absolutely bonkers battery life
can I please have that 12 pro with that lovely scratch 😫
I am going to buy a APPLE iPhone 13 Pro Max - 1TB Gold 5G this week.
Hi please what mic do you use
Put a case on your phone and screen protector
Me just continued using cherry mobile phone huhu
Is the I phone 14 going to be better than the 13 will people still buy the 13 or their isn’t much on it
Love this video, so well presented with you explaining things in loads of detail, yet keeping things simple. Love this phones video capabilities. I like how you went into technical details IE screen brightness etc
Samsung's cameras are ultimately better but their huge downfall is it's so cropped in on the main lens compared to iPhone. For vlogging, that's terrible because it distorts your face and makes your nose look bigger
I'm getting the iPhone 13 max. I'm use to the Samsung Note 10 plus and love the bigger screen. I also have a iPhone 12 which I am not that impressed with. I actually prefer Samsung they just take much better photos on the whole but for communication most people have iPhone so they are better for communication.  Great video. I like the cinematic video. 👍hope I remember it's a thing. 🤣
I don’t get it why some other smartphone users don’t uses hard cases ?!?.
Great job on the video BTW. Well done.
Are you able to copy the video's off that Pro Max 13 unlike my 7? For the life of my I can get my videos off and it is really pissing me off. Make me want to bend this phone in half.
This video is amazing. I'm getting myself a Pro max!
I switched from the 13 to the 13 Pro and I am happy about my switch :)
Thank you great video! Imma go with the 13 max pro
Hello, Last time I saw An IPhone copy from Turkey. So my concern is to know how to make a difference between the original IPhone and IPhone copy from turkey.
😳😳 wow,wow!! Really loved 😍 the video 📸!!!
anyone knows the game when talked about Crazy battery?
I also have the iPhone 13 (Sierra blue) and it is great! Except mine is the pro and not the max
More than the phone, I kinda liked the background scene at the beginning. Good Work!
In this color, everyone will know that it is an old iPhone 13 for years to come.  Info for stupid people
I have Google Pixel 6 Pro, I left 12 Pro Max last year for it. Great camera on 6 Pro, however, I found myself visiting the Apple store in Exeter UK 🇬🇧 today, and asking if I buy the iPhone 14 Pro when in store in September, and I don't like the camera enough, could I return the phone for a refund, I was told yes I could as long as I buy it in store. So, that's my plan now, buy the 14 Pro or Max, test it out camera wise, because that's the only thing I'm a bit concerned about, as my 12 Pro Max wasn't nearly as good as this 6 Pro I have now, but I'm a little put off by some of the bugs on 6 Pro, so I'm like 50/50 which way I'll be going this year, Pixel 7 Pro V 14 Pro/Max?????? Time will tell, I know the 14 Pro will have a 48mp camera which is a good bump up. I did take a few shots on the iPhone 13 Pro in store today, not up to the standard of the 6 Pro quite, but not bad either...... Cheers from Devon! 👍🏻🙂🇬🇧
Hey there. Great Vid. But what is the name of those headphones at 12:58
iphone 13 pro max is just amazing
samsung is all about gimmics
Help. Sierra Blue or Silver?
Absolutely awesome it looks stunning

Looks alright mais il est trop chêr
I currently have the iPhone 11 but am looking to upgrade to the IPhone `3 Pro Max in the 256GB I love the speed  and the fluent of the iPhone. There are some things i like about the iPhone and things I love about android. If the iPhone had the Always On Display and you could have the customization like Android no way i go back to Android.
nice video,  look my latest one as well in cinematic mode iphone 13 pro max
Drone game name please
I need the wallpaper of your 13 pro max please
iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max camera app has no the audio meter which we don’t know the audio is recording or not, or how loud or quiet the sounds we’re recording. I depend on Filmic Pro app that has the audio meter so that it's easy to manage the sound levels while I’m recording. Should we depend on the recording audio quality of the built-in mikes on Apple iPhones?
Wow! The video quality looks great, I am an iPhone guy but we can not afford a iPhone 13.
Jus ordered my 13 pro max fingers crossed
Well Done!!
The new HarmonyOS by Huawei will bring us something like Apple's ecosystem. Hopefully good enough to make them compare each other and improve by time ;)
ur so handsome lol
Looks like Wells
Any tips on where to pick the 13 pro up when it is retired cause i assume apple will retire the 13 pro when the 14 comes out
How come they let the iPhone vampire to come out?
Damn Jessie went from meth labs to making tech vids!
I have s21ultra should me upgrade for 13PM?? Plz help me
Watching from my IPhone 13 pro max 256GB Gold Colour. 🔥

Sir can you tell me my iPhone 13 (one month old) side edge (down left side)start to plug off, its adhesive is seen clearly. Can I handover it  for repair or their is no problem sir  Please answer sir 🙏🏻
Luv my 13promax
Just ordered mine, first iPhone since 6 s plus. I’m bored of android like I got bored of iOS after my last one.   But I love the recent iPad so on my iPad Pro so diving back in!
I don’t think I need the Max either! Thanks man
I feel like the pixel 6 or S22 take better pictures but iPhone is just a whole generation ahead in video
I just bought I phone 13 pro max and loving it. Best phone ever 😍
Well done I really enjoyed this review .
Good review ✌️
I would personally get the 13 pro max, as my phone is my primary device for content consumption, plus im used to big screen phones. But hey 6.1 is also good, just saying personally i would go bigger if i had the option..

lol the cinematic mode looks like a cheap movie ngl
Plz reply someone!  Are "cinematic video mode" and "pro res" available on 13 pro max 128 GB variant???  Plz let me know surely!  I wanna purchase
0:20 " this is from accidently dropping an ipad on it, (dumbass)" is 1000% what i heard at first lmao
60Hz (iPhone) = 30Hz (Samsung) 120Hz (iPhone) = 60Hz (Samsung) 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 (Only Samsung user will understand)
So love iPhone 13 pro max💗
Got the smaller Pro 13. Wish the Max wasn’t so heavy .. I do miss the larger screen 😕
Review shot on S22 ultra please. Thank you.
No so good for  vlogging with that selfie camera quality. Wish there was some way you attach a front facing monitor because those cameras look gorgeous.
Which best 13 or 12 pro max please replay
Very tight slap on I phone users on my comment down below
I phone uses sony camara  I phone uses samsung display  I phone uses samsung semiconductor  When they will be independent on there own
Honestly 2022 that ugly notch wtf yar how you all iphone user manage I phone at display we android user reached curve display wtf I phone
I phone will create mirackle also in future by curve display on I phone🤣
I phone is creating miracle on I phone 14 by removing notch🤣
Ugly notch
why would anyone buy a phone that encourages you to put and BUY music on it when it doesn't come with AN EARPHONE JACK! R U EFFING KIDDING ME! it used to for an effing REASON!  it's not a phone, it's a camera. What THEY call STEREO is actually INFERIOR TRANSISTOR RADIO QUALITY  the competition is actually selling better quality with all the features one expects for the amount of money being spent.
I requested 🙏🙏🙏
Please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Please

I need to phone
you have a nice eyes mate!
Cinematic mode is unreal , try it in real life you’ll be genuinely surprised
Nice review. Especially cool that you shot it on the device you were reviewing. I’m upgrading from iPhone 11 (base) and can’t wait for my 13 PM to get here in a few days. Maybe a few more pics of who I assume is your gf would hold me over?
Everybody: looking at the phone. Me: “ why is there 6k gmail messages?”
give an updated review after 6 months of using it
how can these people give an honest review after 3 days? or are they part of Apple's stealth advertising?
I just got the 13 pro max 1tb and wow amazing phone !!!!
Reply me please
Please give me a iphone 13 pro max i m not buying  ???
Great review. Excellent quality video it has to be said. Got my new one today so looking forward to getting to know it.
I’m trying to move over to the apple ecosystem as I bought my first ever MacBook Pro and a 11 pro max, but I’m a massive note user and still got my 512gig note 20 ultra and my fold 3 , which I might be selling, so many comments on you tube saying don’t upgrade from the 11pm to the 13pm , so I don’t know what to do , stick with my 11 pro max and ditch both my Samsung phones , or buy the 13 pro max , or just stick with my note 20ultra, any comments would be appreciated
I bought the phone on the 1st week of the release and until now it had restarted on its own 2 times before the screen going randomly pink for a second, both times while using the camera. First time on iOS 15.2 and today on iOS 15.2.1. Is it a hardware or software issue? In analytics i see two panic-full crash logs, this is my first iPhone ever, does someone know is my device okay or?
Solid video!
how much did Apple pay you for the opening of this video??
13 Pro Max for sure
Thank you for info just got mine.
Iphone 13 pro max is the best phone for my personal use
I saw this video after ordering the iPhone 13 pro max 🤣
This is my third day having an iPhone 13 max pro. I’ve never had an iPhone before, I’ve had every note until 3 days ago my note 20 ultra had the black screen of death even with insurance on the phone I’ve decided to switch to iPhone. And yes the iPhone is annoying at times like where’s the damn back button . But Ibe charged the phone twice !!!! Twice like wtf in 3 days !! What is going on here ! How long will this last !?! Until the battery get weaker ? This battery alone I think was worth the switch. Although you can be a lot more shady with android like delete everything and not leave a trace and you can’t with apple but wowzers this battery
Ngl I've had the S20 for the past 2 years and I've now bought a 13 Pro so I've officially transferred over to IOS. Only one thing to criticise, if I was on say 0% battery on my S20 before I go out I can pop it on charge and 30 mins later it's on 60%. Getting to 60% takes years on the iPhone
Thinking of making the switch, but worried about fast charging, something that I enjoy having on Android phones.
watching this on my iphone 13 pro max graphite 256gb! my first iphone and the best phone i have used so far !
Can you give me the phone plz 🥺
Thanks for the decent review & solid insights...  I've just decided to make the move from my Note 20 Ultra 5G to the iPhone 13 Pro Max and really looking forward to receiving it tomorrow.  I'm a huge Android fan (owned every Pixel bar the current 6 Pro, owned all the Samsung Notes and had the 20 & 21 Ultra also)  But with having a Pixel 4XL still as my business mobile (and it tends to be my 'go to' for decent picture taking); having an iPhone back in my ecosystem to go alongside my M1 MBA and M1 iPad Pro makes a lot of sense 👌🏻
Anyone here experiencing the same problem while shooting 24 and 30fps video on iphone 13 pro max. Its kinda like stuttering
Upgrading to 13 Pro Max from Note 10.
What microphone are you using while recording this on the iPhone 13 Pro Max?
The EU is making it so new phones only have USB C right?
Did you realize the iphone isnt as strong as one would seem - especially if you broke it using a hot ipad...
I recommend to go with the pro than the pro max. The pro max is so big it's like you're holdding a tablet.but it's dddewpewnddd on you it's your money. Be wise. There's no huge difference. Go with the pro.
What is that blue wallpaper on the iPhone 13 pm at 1:24?
Could a fool me it was from a phone you recorded the whole video with, iPhone was awesome.
3:40 I just realized I never have my brightness higher than 30% on my iPhone 12 Pro unless (ofcourse if it does by itself)
Please sir give me i phone 13 pro max please sir please i don't have money please sir give me i phone 13 pro max 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

Imagine battery life on 14 pro max
M.V.P'S  THANK*YOU* FOR THE REVIEW ON 13 PRO MAX.( JOB WELL DONE.).. OUR FAMILIA REALLY ENJOY'S THE 13 iPHONE PRO MAX !  LA CHINITA WITH BMWLACHIKC.FTC.
I’m using a OnePlus 7 Pro and am contemplating the switch to iPhone.  Love my clean screen currently - no hole punch or notch. But herein lies my question:  on the iPhone 13 ProMax with 18:9 video content (or 2:1), does the notch protrude into the image at all?    I’ve heard that on the 13 mini and the 13 Pro it does, but not on the 13 pro max.  A owner/user perspective would be great! Thanks and keep up the good work
Please also mention about lens flare issue at night. Apple hasn't fixed the issue and all the users are struggling with it.
Nice video I will go with 13 pro max
Switch from iphone
Great phone very user friendly
I’ve ordered the iPhone pro max Sierra blue, transitioning from iPhone 11 purple, so excited love the large screen :-)
Maybe you should give me  the 12 pro max as a Christmas gift :<
Wanting the 13 Pro :)
it is so impressive how good the battery is on the 13 pro max
Please edeting  videio 3 8k raw pro res
Finally an in-depth review with proof of quality. This is the only review I sat and watched from start to finish. The others just couldn’t hold my attention. Subscribed!
God this guy is smoking hot
Came here because I’m waiting for my iPhone 13 pro max to arrive but commenting to ask where you filmed it 😆 the place looks like somewhere I’d love to visit 😊
I just ordered the 13 pm, and am happy with the positive reviews everybody is giving. Kinda sad its on back order for a month tho
Best smartphone of the year. Period.
Hi! What did you use to edit this video? Did you do it from your iPhone as well?
Great video send me your all Iphone hahahaha
Just ordered one. Wasn't planning of buying an iPhone,  but found the Pro Max at a pretty decent price. Think I'm gonna miss my Samsung S20 Ultra lol
13 pro max
only get the smaller one if u have small hands! the pro max is great for big hands as I have thanks.
Could you please give me an iPhone 13 pro in EMI ? Please. Btw I live in India. Big fan.
This is too expensive, one should spend this money on travelling countries instead.
I would like to have one for my son struggling with his iPhone 6 16 GB Silver that has already caused him alot of problems in the past including in school, any color may do and whatever memory variant, my son is not a picky one as well. Thank you so much for your kind heart
The horrible cinematic mode was a dead giveaway. Don't get me wrong, I like their video and photo processing, but that fake depth of feild, the haloing, inconsistent blur, etc. is unusable and just looks janky. You're better not using it to be entirely honest.
Incredible that's shot on iPhone. DSLR days are numbered..
Honestly i just switched to an s21 ultra and while i love Samsung i'm considering getting the 13 pro max because one thing i already miss with Apple is the damn watches and their annoying eco system! it might be simple but it just works great. I'm not a mac user so the Samsung is far better to use with windows but i can live without that. With phones being so good these days it really just comes down to personal preference but either way there's plenty of great phones to suit each persons taste.
Finally , i upgraded from i phone Xs max to  I phone 13 pro max sierra blue and i totally agree to your review. Its cinematic mode is just amazing 🤩 and also the pictures taken in night mode or low light turns up so well 👏🏻
Excelente calidad de video cuando comenzó el review pensé que bien que se ve debe ser una cámara profesional y cuando dijiste que estaba filmado con el Iphone no podía creerlo
my transaction from 12 pro to 13 pro max 👍👍
Hii sir, am your big fan, please help me, 🙏my phone is cracked and no money 😢please help me 😭please sir am your big fan ,,please 🙏I want phone 😢
👍👍👍
11:43 I busted out laughing here 😂
Hey great video  what game were you playing ?
only ever owned a 5s, have recently been using a samsung s10e for over a year now but i finally chose to go to apple and get the 13 pro due to seeing its insane battery and everything else, even the 13 pro battery is insane, i just cant face having a phone as big as the max haha
My dream phone 😩 When kaya 🥺🥺😭
Great video. Pretty awesome it was shot on a 13 pro. Looks pretty great!
I am watching your video on my Iphone 13 pro max . The best phone😍
Do you do giveaways? T
I begging all tha utuber to give me a phon no one can give me a phon bcoz I have a 2 gb ram phon vey lak to use that plz sir can u give me a phon
I've made the switch to iOS. I went to O2 and upgraded to the Fold 3 - worst mistake I've ever made. I've never felt the need to be more delicate with my phone as i did with the Fold. Yes, Samsung say the protective film is 80% more durable, but it's still plastic at the end of the day.  I made the switch to iOS because they've now bought 120hz. If Apple had introduced this back on the iPhone 11 or 12, I probably would've switched sooner. But coming from the Android side of things where we've had higher refresh rate displays for a few years now. I couldn't see myself going to back to 60hz on the iPhone 11 or 12.
My PM comes this Tuesday.  I'm not worried about how it fits in my hand, I have big hands and it should be great.
I like the décor of your home :)
Thanks for your video, very informative. I’ll be upgrading to the 13 pro max from the 8 and very much looking forward to it now
This is why people need to get Apple care + if they are rocking without a case lol.
Welcome to the dark side :)
Hate the auto bright for photo after take i hope next ios can fix it
I’ll be honest I have slightly bigger hands then most, so I do enjoy the bigger feel of the max. Amazing quality of this video makes me excited about shooting things with it. Good video for sure
Did your iPhone camera have any flare (green dot)issue?
good video, I liked the laid backness, funny how everyones saying "bokeh" like "bouquet" now lol...i prefer to be japanese about it "bo`ka"..gonna try the 13  , love my ipad....
Who needs this video focus on object and rest totally blurry.
This is really beautiful, thank you Loki
I may get this in the new year
Why are cameras becoming able to capture reality better then our own eyes lol.
Switching from note 20+ to iphone. the battery is the dealmaker for me.   After being spoilt by literal 2 day battery life on the huawei mate 20 pro, i havent been able to find an android phone with such good battery life since.
If I don't use it I'm going to lose the smart guy around me, this is the point to me...but anyway it seems so interesting when you use the updated iPhone to show you're really the guy who is closed to the world!  Great job!
CHAMPMAN🦠COM
What game name 4.34 ??
Holy cow 🐄 so you’re telling me it’s possible to get even more battery life if you limit the display to 60hz?!
Androids have a lot of nifty features like multitask and AoD. However, in terms of build quality, chip performance, power efficiency, and software updates, nothing comes close to an iPhone.
13 Pro Max is phone of the year!!
Can you still get 3G on the iPhone 13 pro max. As if the 4g drops signal my XMAS automatically goes to 3G
Your very lucky that the crack is at the back while mine is on the front 🤣
You re so cute x🥰
Great tech talk filmed awesome in a 13pro wonderful lighting and clear speaker I picked up the 13pro  switch from an 8+ was just to big in my pocket
Whats the game 2:15??
Chris Martin! 🙄
the shots taken with iphone cinematic mode was clearly noticible and thats the point where phone cameras hasn't reached yet
Stumbled upon your channel for the first time and I gotta say that your content is top quality -- also you got a new subscriber!
Iphone noob..
People will be kicking themselves in few weeks if they miss the opportunity to buy and invest in bitcoin
Xmas wish... 🎄
M gonna buy it soon 🤩  Waiting for long to price go down ❤️
Tech camp  I just need one iphone 13 pro
cinematic mode is shit. who the f wants a totally blurry background all the time?
Great review
Great to see Vicar's Close again!
Great video and filming. I'm staying with my 12pm (but I'm jealous)!
I could tell you were shooting in cinematic mode as it looked artificial and "processed" rather than what you'd get with an SLR. It was defiantly in some sort of "uncanny valley". It can also run into AI blurring problems where it blurs things it should do (see the top corner of the phone around 11:45)... but on the whole it's impressive.
I think that the pro res video capability will still be available on the 128gb models but it will be recording in 1080p which uses 1.5gb storage per minute..
I would never buy iphone  babe it just looks so all same as 3 years ago and Samsung is 100% better.
You will be able to shoot ProRes on the 128GB, but it will be shot at 1080p not the 4K like on the 256GB, 512GB and 1TB models
Loved your review! I upgraded from an iPhone XS Max to the gold iPhone 13 Pro Max 1TB that I preordered on Septemeber 17 from Verizon. Still waiting for it to ship, but I am so excited and trying to stay patient by watching reviews on it. lol
I’m surprised I haven’t seen the memes yet saying (Shot on IPhone)
☝️☝️  I was broke before I met her  Now I can afford iPhone 13 promax all because of her
Really love the camera of iPhone 13 pro max 😍
Great video but I have said this to multiple people it just feels so minimal even tho 11 pro max to the 12 pro max felt like a minimal upgrade so if you have a 11 pro max or 12 pro max I would keep it for 1 more year till the 14 but idk that’s just my opinion
5:40 omg he just said phones like S21 Ultra won't last you 3-4-5 years. He seriously went ahead and said exactly that. How stupid is that -_-
I am an S21 Ultra owner who gives credit to the IPhone 13 Pro Maxfor shooting great video no question. You own either phone and you are very fortunate. Just one thing stops me considering an iPhone as a genuine potential next purchase; and that is the lack of a pause record feature on the video camera to do basic editing on the fly. I use this all the time on my S21 Ultra. There are apps out there to give the iPhone this ability but they don't seem to me and my research to be up to the job. Why is this feature still not on the iPhones video camera to give it the flexibility (and potential selling point) it truly deserves?.
Leaving s21 ultra  for iphone 13 pro max . But will still love using 21 ultra both awesome anyway 😎
No split screen? God damn won't buy it then 🙄
Is there a shutter issue? Or was I the only one who thought the visual wasn't smooth enough? Or does that have something to do with shooting at 60fps?
Mans switched to 3G for a second
That cinematic mode needs some work
Great vid, even more amazing that it was taken with the 13 Pro Max. 👍
How do I watch my own videos on an iPhone lol. Like movies I've downloaded not from the apple store.
just would like to check, is 128GB for latest iphones like this 13promax enough, or should get the next which is  256GB?  Been using android for the last 3 years and my 128GB still does well.   one of my concern is the file size the new iphone would set for photos,vids, and apps. tnx
Wallpaper link?
13 pro
still waiting a phone that can conquer Genshin Impacr
I’m upgrading from iPhone 11 I’m worried the 13 pro will be too small Shame pro max is just too big too chunky and heavy
Considering the screen is so big on the pro max you’d think the text and apps and even taking photos would be bigger but no they don’t take up more of the screen lol
What charger brick do I buy for the 13 pro and pro max? How many Watts
👏🏻 bravo
Thank you for your review the best video I ever seen and I already bought the IPhone 13 pro max even before I watch this video. Because I am a photographer.
Tbh this phone almost addresses all the issues I've avoided the last 3 iPhones but the notch still disturbs me. Will probably get this or the Pixel 6 Pro
Still prefer my Motorola edge 20 pro
Thanks for translation 🤍🌸
Amazing review
I always got the Max version but this time I decided to get the pro. No complaints. Especially because I walk around with a Fold 3 in my pocket as well…
11:28 I loved this girl 🤍
1:02 yes i can tell. The fake depth of field was pretty jarring.
Thank you for the review. I think Iphone 13 Pro Max is suitable for me because I am using it for vlogging (videos, picture and editing). All in one phone!
The video looked very professional !! I have ordered the 13 pro max…..can’t wait for it to arrive !!
I can't follow up, that this is a good camera setup to name it.  I am almost using a phone to make photos and less videos, where I think apple is the master of.  Photos in the 13 pro max I see a lot of contrast, less realistic skin tones (too red) less realistic color at all, too blue sky and too red house walls.  Indeed the camera catches more light than the pre model 12, but it makes it useless for standard best photos. Also the 3 times Tele is not good enough if you zoom in it must be very bright environment light to have good result
I can’t take you seriously with that shattered iPhone
manifesting
Just stumbled across your site. Great! Got my pro max on order & subscribed to your site.  Nice work. Where is the location?
Very big phone and heavy 🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐
I’m waiting for mine my husband ordered the blue Sierra 😍
Wells ..nice place
go max or go home
I still have and am attached to my note 20 ultra but my God have i forgotten about battery stress every since i got 13 pro max as my first iPhone
im staying away from cinematic mode for the time being. it does not look good.
Wow, an entire (vivid) video shot on the iPhone. Looks great!
Wow, an entire (vivid) video shot on the iPhone. Looks great!
Wonderful video and content. You’ve done a masterful job with explaining size, battery life and other specs. I’m glad I waited to make a purchase and watch your video, before I decided, and you’ve sold me on the 13 Pro. Thanks for all of the valuable information, and keep up the great work! You have another subscriber. Cheers!
I just made the switch 2 weeks ago. Note 20 ultra. They are 97 % the same. You can enable a floating screen and do two things at once. Apple does it well were everything just works without fiddling  And the ultra maybe I got 7 hours of screen time the 13 pro max can do 20
If you want to sell the broken 13 pro max for a cheap price , I’m in🙂
One day, long long overdue, they'll stop calling it a phone.
Thank you for this video..your one of the first tech reviewers to have a good full review of the 13 Pro Max in less than a month of its launch.. Also am not a fan of photo/camera reviews I usually skip past them in reviews but I had to watch the new Pro Max photo/video review on this..good job & keep up the good work & shoutout to your camera guy too
4:43 look at the lag, I'm not an apple hater but many people out there think iOS it's perfect, and they are android haters.
can you link the case you are using?
Got my new 13 pro max ordered, looking forward to seeing the difference between it and my current iPhone X
Really confused between iPhone 13 pro and 13 PRO MAX? Which one should I get? Is the battery difference and the size really noticeable between the two?
I just ordered the 13 pro max but I’m lowkey looking forward to what Samsung does next with the Galaxy 22. As a lifelong iPhone user, I’ve grown very bored of it.
anyone who defends samsungs exynos chips in europe when they pay the same price as those who got the faster and better snapdragon comes across as a paid shill
Im always a high end guy so i buy the iPhone 13 pro max graphite in 1TB
CUTIES
If you buy one, 13Pro or 13Pro max?
What ? The video was captured by the iPhone? This is perfect 🤩
Hey!  Do you have an issue on your phone like: “The ‘volume up’ button in my new iPhone 13 Pro makes a distinctive metal-on-metal, louder-than-normal clicking sound, as if it was missing a rubber component. The ‘volume down’ button is OK and sounds much more muted.” ???
Low light UW is better on 12 Pro max.
Yo I'm in this video 😂 I work in the caffe nero in Wells. I served you! Didn't realise you were a YouTuber lol
13 pro max🥺
Why wouldn’t you spend the extra $100 for the new iPhone when you’re spending $1,000 either way? It’s a bit silly to not get the new iPhone. That’s a lot of hardware for $100.
It's a shame Apple in many ways spoil what is an incredible package with their so-called "customer support". The locking of phone parts via software, so that even identical official parts from identical phones don't work when swapped over, is frankly ridiculous. It seems incredible that there isn't legislation against such things to protect consumers from what is arguably a racket setup by Apple to prevent the repair of their devices. Swapping out packaging; and getting rid of chargers etc means nothing when they pressure you into buying a new device for what would otherwise be a simple repair.  I love Apples eco-system in terms of functionality between devices, but that could be much improved for products OUTSIDE of their walled garden. As a company they've definitely lost their way.
The video quality is incredible! So much so that the Samsung S22 isn't even out yet and I still believe that the iPhone 13 PM will still be better once it is. I held off upgrading to the S21 from my Samsung Galaxy S10 but now I'm seriously considering going to iPhone.
apple products are boring and overrated,120hrz ? lol been around 3 years on android  better cameras ? lol s21 ultra is still better speed test ? i have seen speed test and the s21 ultra and 11 ultra are faster in opening apps
Do any of these cinematic video or photo modes transfer over to the iPad Pro with iOS 15?
Cinematic mode makes the background look like a greenscreen cause its so excessively processed (while you were in the streets) imo
The quality in this video was amazing ! What was used to record the audio ? Was it the iPhone mic or something you plugged in ? Looking forward to using an iPhone to vlog but was wondering if you would recommend just using the phone for audio
Excellent review! A great phone! Greetings from Venezuela 🇻🇪
This was shot on an iPhone 📲 WOW 🤩
13 PM… definitely! I bought it!
The ain't no way I'm switching to IOS  Samsung I stayyyy
still waiting for that 36 or 48mp camera
The video looked super high quality and professional. I doubt he did it completely handheld meaning no stands/tripods or no humble handheld stabilizers but still the quality is insane. If this was completely handheld with no other devices…WOW😳
from 12 pro max to upgrade to 13 pro max...its just a bloody waste of money...the difference is not impressive......hard to justify...a small advantage of battery life and 120 hz...screen....nah...i will pass...will wait for iphone 14 pro max or 15 pro max
Upgrading to the 13 Pro from the 7 in a couple weeks. Very excited for the battery life improvements, OLED, much better cameras, and 120 hz.
Excellent work, thank you.
iPhone 13 pro or max? Which is better?? I don’t know which one to buy
I kept my iPhone 11 Pro max till this year and I'm glad I did. The 12 pro max was ok but I really wanted the 120 hz and better battery and the 13 pro max has that. It is really worth the upgrade.
Got the 13 Pro Max. Switched from a Note 10 +. I have giant hands so its comfortable to me for sure. Overall, really glad I made the switch, its a beast of a phone.
The video is awesome is been 2weeks plus I have not received mine 13pm
The Best review of iphone 13 pro max yet
The video quality looks superb...but then I think about how good the Pixel 6 might be!
Great idea using the phone itself for shooting the video 😍 great stuff, got yourself a new follower!
Nice
Really good review. Didn’t know 60fps was still adaptive. The only thing I’d challenge is this narrative that Apple ‘make stuff thinner’. The iPhone has either stayed the same or got thicker, mostly the latter, for at least 5 years now. From 6 through 7, 8, X, 11 and 12 there’s been a steady fattening.
If I can get my finances under control I may be purchasing a 13 Pro Max.
Give me a phone because I want to use it
👍👍
We could never use an ihope because 1. ther eis no youtubeVanced 2. There is no auto bluetooth shutdown 3. Most awesome isolation features of Calyx OS are missing in ios.
As regards Apple, you’re preaching to the converted. I’m already well ensconced into the Apple eco- system and love it. If, or to be more accurate, when I decide to upgrade, it will unquestionably be the Pro Max. I really appreciate the extra screen real estate and as I regularly work 15 + hour shifts, that extra Batttery life is a god send.  As regards that video quality, well, it wasn’t outstanding, but considering it was shot on a device you are likely to have on you and can be comfortably carried in your pocket, or clipped securely to your waste belt, it is better than good enough!
I found the 13 pro max  too big so exchanged for the 13 pro, I switched from the Galaxy Note series that I’ve used for ten years
even audio was from the phone?
Beautiful video, thank you! Where was it shot? This place looks amazing!!
This really helped me! I'm a longtime Droid user, which it always seems as if iPhone's provide the best results in quality. I have two phones, which I just upgraded to this one for my business use of photos and videos, and will still use Samsung for my every day use phone. I guess the best of both worlds now. Looking forward to learning this first iPhone for myself. And, your video quality is amazing in this video, so that in itself, excites me!!!!!!!
iPad uses body slam on iPhone 12 pro max, it's super effective!
The quality is insane
Bro, I have iPhone 13 pro   When I took a video and I shot while moving, the video is become unclear, like when u move, if there is words or logo, it's become unclear   Please support
Very cool video thanks for your details! Will be buying one tomorrow.. stay safe and thanks for being awesome
which game was that?
The video is stunning. I guess i wont be needing vlogging cameras and just use iPhone 13 Pro.
Vivo X70 pro+
I upgraded from the 12 pro to the 13 pro and it is worth every single penny. I agree with everything you said 100%. I cannot wait to play around with the video camera more.
I could tell it was shot on the phone. The outlining of your body is cringy AF, especially around the face. Mostly the ears
Wish we could remove these ridiculous Apple shills from my YouTube home screen. Nobody that has a Z flip, fold, or S21 are downgrading to Apple's dinosaur phones. More people have switched away from Apple this year than ever before. The desperation with my YouTube algorithm is palatable.
Very informative.. I bought it on 24 of last month .. thanks from pakistan
Wow thats great!! I hope i can get one😀
Genshin Impact? 👀
എനിക്ക് ഒരു ഫോൺ തരുമോ ചേട്ടാ ഐ ഫോൺ ഉപയോഗിക്കാൻ ആഗ്രഹം കൊണ്ടാണ്
love the scenery! and the fact you filmed this on the iphone is amazing! i would've believed it's a high end camera. nice!
Do you think it’s worth upgrading from a iPhone 11 Pro to a 13 Pro? I’m thinking about that for weeks 🤔
what's the brand of your table?
My current note 9 in hopes of note 21... But was watching the iPhone release with the announcement of 120hz this sets my eye on the Pro Max! While Android and their never ending optimization or do they ever will in 5 years? I'm taking the leap to the dark side. Placed an order and till Android fixes all their mess. I was actually a big fanboi of Android(oneplus,xiaomi,samsung) and the non-stop of seeking for new features/Custom ROMs has come to an end for now after getting old... :')
He’s too cute 👍🏼
I’m going to buy the 13 Pro Max soon. Really exited for it…
That fake bokeh is impressive that it's working in video, but it stands out pretty badly to me. Maybe a couple of iterations later it'll be unnoticeable
From 6s max to 13 pro max not too shabby
Going for iphone 13 pro max from iPhone XS Max
How did you record the audio?
you serious!!! its shoot on iphone?!!! damn the bokeh is 🔥
So, I went into a local phone/other stuff shop and got myself the 12pro on back order as they were out of stock, fair enough put down a healthy deposit and left the store. Back home I figured look up YouTube and see what the new phones were like only to discover that in less than a week there was to be the iPhone 13, this was the reason for the sorry the 12 will need to be a back order they had sold out so there was no old stock when the new 13 arrived. Back to the shop, bit or Rant and Rave and the odd swear word and within 4 days I would have the 13 pro max would be mine on launch day. Now I am in Australia so this was now an $1800 phone, Saturday arrives being in no hurry I wandered in after lunch to get my new phone only to be told that there had been a RUSH and they had Sold my phone to another customer and was assured that within a week they might have another or for a few $'s more I could have a 256 gig in my favorite blue sky color on launch day, now I''m looking north of $2150!!! So being the mature 69 year old that I am I quietly started to toss a Tantrum that slowly got louder and as I had used this store for the last 27 years explained that never again would I darken there door for goods and that they should refund my full deposit in cash and also send a truck to my shed and collect the new 75inch TV and 2 door Fridge that were unopened in there box due to renovations being ongoing. Not a long time later I left with my new Sky blue 250gig blue phone and a C to USB cable an.d a pair of wired earphones for not a cent more than already paid up. Now here is the Kicker I have not even opened it yet as I want a case and screen protector before I use it. But I now know more about this phone than all the others I have ever brought.....well the iPhone 7 that I am still using as I have only ever owned 2 phones now. Thank you for a great video you have my Thumb  Up and Sub. Tony
Where do I get that pro Max’ wallpaper?
The cinematic mode has a lot of potential but atm it looks very CGI
Got to look at reviews because everyone is talking bad about the new 13 pro 😩
Still rocking my iPhone 12, love it, but battery life dissapoints. I switch back to budget android phones often for better battery life. iPhone 13 offers the best of both worlds, great phone. Great video 👌
going from 11 pro max to 13 pro max
Do you still get the glare reflection on the lens when taking a picture against a lightbulb or the sun?
- 4k 24fps cinematic mode - being able to switch out of macro manually  - finger print reader And I’m sold
Going from XS max to IPhone 13 Pro max!
Biggest diff in camera Andr-Apple is a third party apps access to all camera enhanced stuff... in Android you still have rudimentary camera from Instagram. :((((
transitioning isn't dodgy in any context :)
Khaby lovers will subscribe ❤ Kahby haters will like
Lights arw blowout unlike with my s21 ultra that is why i canceled my pre-order.
2:18 what game is that?
Great quality video
Good video made on iPhone.
This is really great video! Different than other iPhone 13 Pro videos. Well done!
Hi and thank you for this. I have the 12 Pro Max, I’ve found I’ve had to go in to Lightroom to adjust photos in order to make them look good. There are changes in the 13 Pro Max camera and video, I like the way the focus on faces change that’s brilliant, and the 3X zoom is slightly better, and the macro makes a difference. However, for me, I don’t think it’s worth the upgrade this year, so I’m still going to buy the Google Pixel 6 Pro this month on release day, because I like taking photos, and being able to do everything on my phone, and I do genuinely believe the Pixel will be the best camera on any phone this year, I don’t particularly want a 50X or 100X zoom, they’re not useable at that level it’s a gimmick really. Enjoy your videos! 👍🏻🙂
This is why I miss the iPhone.  Just easy workings. My whole family have iPhones and they love the simple world of apple with icloud, imessage etc.  I'm the only one that is using an Android phone so miss out on the ease of Apple..but that is because with my work I have to send pictures in emails and for some odd reason Apple removed attachments. They embed the picture into the email. Why I don't know. It is a massive pain.  If they would turn it back to allow attachments I would be back with my family and the apple family in a flash
What’s the name of the mobile game at 2:14?  Thanks in advance!
Fun fact, if you have an Apple Watch you can set it up a second way of authenticating yourself to unlock your phone when you are wearing a mask.
Can you pause a video recording and pick it back up where you left off whit this "new" phone ?
7:25 Jajajaja so funny!
Actually reviewers are wrong saying the iPhone 13 is limited to 20W.  Nope. Max Tech showed you can benefit from using 30W chargers as they tested that it will charge up to 27W.
I tried using the note 20 ultra and it feels slow compare to the iPhone and I'm using the 11 pro max.
I will go with 13pro max 512gb. Thanks for the update
Apple doesn’t have the split screen functioning that one can use two apps at the same time
Just ordered my 13 pro max after 6 years on Samsung.  Cant wait to get him. It is gonna be a long week 😅
Hi, what is the location at the beginning? Awesome scenery!
That cinematic mode looks absolutely hideous lmao I really like the camera quality, but I'd never use that cinematic feature
A mask 😷 is not a problem if you got a Apple Watch on it’s just as quick, and I do a lot of bits on mine and my boys cars and with the finger sensor haft the time it did not work if hands got a bit grumpy never had problem with Face ID
Why I skipped iP13 1. notch  2. bokeh still on "trial" phase, since it 's new tech for Apple. maybe next year the technology will be more mature 3. they may bring back finger print sensor on iP14  but it's good to know that they are catching up with android features. looking forward for satellite signal on iP14, Apple should lead the innovation. Dont fall behind.
What a nonsense
Hey bud. Great video! I got the 13 pro last week. I came from the XS. I love the phone overall. I’ve noticed on speaker phone or FaceTime the sound is off. Its not crisp, sounds lower/further away and pitchy at times like if a speaker was blown in a sense. Playing music, netflix etc sounds great. Im wondering if i received some sort of a defective phone or if its just how it is. I ran all diagnostics at apple and everything seems fine. They’re sending me a new phone tomorrow so i’ll see if it is in fact a defect
Cinematic mode background blur looks "fake" cutting around the person is very noticeable in your opening scenes.
Apple keeps selling the idiotic the same phone, over and over.
Could one if you do a decibel test on I phone 13 pro , vs pro max vs 12 pro max
I think I keep my 11 pro and give my wife the 13 pro max for  Christmas she is still on the X pro max and love to take photos and small vids
Always the best info..Now I see how I am in love in Samsung G. S21 Ultra 🤩
The quality of the camera isn't  good at all.
One of the best iphone 13 pro max reviews out there 🔥
Your Phone review is verry good 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
🥰🥰🥰🥰🌺🌺🌺
The selfie camera is crap - while the main cam is outstanding. I don‘t get why Apple is not improving the selfie cam. I miss a fingerprint sensor, too. That‘s what forces me to own Samsung, although I would love to have an iPhone again after 3 yrs of abstinence
footage looked amazing for a phone
As an old iphone user, I am happy with  my current phone s21ultra. Not planning to buy iphone 13 pro
😬😳*shot on iPhone*
I've been on android since the start of Smartphones, but I am swaying towards the iPhone 13 Pro. The spec is great but I think the privacy priority is long overdue. Great review, many thanks 👍
Thanks for the video and great job. Have 12 PM 256g and picking up my 13 PM 512g today. Bought a 13 Pro but returned it because  fingers kept hiding camera as camera has larger bump this year plus I prefer larger screen size. I did notice the smoother and quicker screen while I had the 13 Pro. Used to be a very big Android user and fan but as cool as Android phones are never had one that eventually didn’t lag and slow up. Not the case with iPhone. Thanks again
Also look for vivo x70 pro plus which has even better camera than iphone but this edition of 13 pros has nailed it in all aspects those who r in apple ecosystem its a good upgrade for them
Love it
Hi there!! Great review... really enjoyed it!👍🙂... I have been  Samsung user for the last 22 years.. every single phone I have had is the latest Samsung. Although I am very happy with them (not a single thing has eve gone wrong).. I just fancies a change and am seriously considering an iPhone 13 Pro Max. What would you say, Tech Chap? Is the change/transition recommended in terms of usage, build quality, getting used to a new user interface, reliability or should I stick with Samsung? 🤔.. Your opinion would be very much appreciated!🙏🙂🙏
I just bought an iPhone 13 pro, 👍🏾
I can't see my self in 2021 baying phone with nochi heel know
Que jogo é esse aí de nave?
Getting the 13 Pro Max
Great job for Compare 12pro max to 13pro max. I like big phone, I can see better. I have 12pro max now, still waiting for my 13pro max.
This man uses the phone so confidently without a case its scary
Found this channel a few days ago and I'm loving it! Btw is this Durham cathedral? Went to uni there about a decade ago 🤣🤣
What did you use for audio... thanks
Personally i don't like the focus on the closer subject,  but it may just be my taste.
Focus the camera on a logo or text, then move the camera slow, the text get unclear??! then compare with other iphone
I switched from à Samsung s10 plus to the IPhone 13 Pro Max and It’s amazing!! 👍👌
Video quality is really good
Great informative video, but I didn't like the cinematic mode. Looked weird the whole time. Regular video for the win.
The cinematic mode looks terrible 🤦🏽‍♂️
The iPhone13 pro cons: *Too heavy  *Uncomfortable to hold *120hz screen not that noticeable with IOS and certain Apps *5g is pointless, unless you game or constantly video call  Wish more YouTubers noted the extra weight gain!!!
I still have the white XR 💯❤️
I wouldn't have known that this video was shot on the iPhone if he didn't mention it.
Day by day iPhone And Samsung is getting boring   Other
Pls give me???
Bro, I got a Iphone 6s and i want to upgrade. Is 13 is worth to upgrade or should i wait for next model of apple??
about to finally switch after being a galaxy user from the beginning. I love the concept of having widgets and a desktop, which have never been available on iphone. But, with the battery finally passing up galaxy and having all google apps available and a good transfer app, i will be making the move to a 13 pro or max
Got a 13 Pro - first time since iPhone 3G on iOS and I agree with everything you said from 11:40. It does some things well but missing fingerprint reader and customization will make me return it and wait for whatever S22 will be. Charging is really slow considering my OnePlus 7 Pro had 30W charging in 2019. Battery life is great. Bezels are huge and ugly and the camera bumps are just plain ugly - albeit they do take amazing photos and videos.
Great vid 💯💯💯⚡⚡
If Cinematic mode keeps improving like they did with Portrait mode, I do see DSLR's becoming obsolete for small video production-cases like this.
What's the name of the game u playing in
wow the portrait looks bad on video. The edges are very very blurry. It's very noticeable. It seemed better on earlier videos,
New device SOT surely you'll easily get 10 hrs.
yeah..without finger sprint is a bit annoying. The best solution for iphone now is use it with apple watch so can continue to unlock with mask
13 pro is better
Sponsored by Caffe Nero 😋
video quality is amazing on this phone couldn’t really believe that this whole video was shot on a iphone 13 . very impressive
Give the old phone if you don't like it anymore .... 😂
The only thing i need to know is if that’s your cat (14:05) and if i can have it. 😂
Iphone 13 PM indeed recommendable even if its little bigger or heavier 😂 Upgrade is a must 🥰🥰🥰
Which game u were playing in first 2:10 min?
Beautiful shots of England.
You are so gorgeous anyway
You have smaller size hand that's why you can't hold 13 pro max
You are correct! I'd go for 13 Pro too :)
I was at best buy today and looked at the iphone 13 pro side by side with my s21. Nice to see Apple finally bring 120hz refresh screen. That's the best upgrade other than the battery. Once you go 120hz, you can never go back to 60hz. Each year, I'm more and more tempted to finally try iphone as my primary phone, but each year I just stick with android. I have no other apple products, so that can't be a reason for me. However, when I left best buy today, i got in my car and launched google maps, spotify podcast, checked gmail real quick. Just those few things caused my s21 to have a stroke for a few seconds, just completely freezing. Also, I've had my first smart watch ever, the galaxy watch 4, for about a week now. And it likes to stutter occasionally. Is watch stuttering still a thing in 2021? Or is that just another nice Samsung feature? I've always had android phones, and this is my 4th Samsung. It just seems to be a normal thing at this point, no matter how much RAM or how powerful the processor is supposed to be, a Samsung product will have stutters and lag, probably even brief freezes. The fact that it acted like this today after I just checked out the iphone 13, was almost enough for me to say, IT'S TIME TO SWITCH. But I've decided to watch for the Pixel 6 and see what Google is offering with their nice and clean UI.
I'd consider an iPhone only with a side load option, F-Droid, a root option and 100% open source iOS. My S21U after removal of all Samsung's CrapWare holds two full days with 10-11  SOT. Don't think iPhone 13 is able to bit it.
I forgot that this video was shot on 13 pm and I was still thinking damn, that’s a great video quality heh
As a Pixel 4XL user, I was excited about the Pixel 6 Pro. But seeing the leaked prices that put it above the iPhone 13 Pro, for the first time, the iPhone 13 Pro looks like a more compelling package.
captured but edited and rendered on a computer.
so the switch was for battery life only? the camera upgrade was such a minimal bump compared to the s21 that i can't belive this was part of the reason. the OS i surely not the reason since you were in android.   so battery life only?
Buying a 13 PRO MAX
After watching this, i don't want an iPhone 13, i want a trip to England!
So do u really think that the iPhone 13 worth every penny I just want to know peoples thoughts that’s all
I must say, I didn't know the intro was filmed with the iPhone until you mentioned it.
I have 75% battery at the end of the day (at 72% now at this crazy late time) with my s21 ultra. I get three days from it, first time in a loooong time that's been the case.
Great video/review. For the reasons you mentioned I'm switching from the 12 pro max to the 13 pro. Finally they both have the same specs and the 13 pro has a slightly better battery than the 12 pro max which has been great for the past 12 months for me. Also being shot on the phone shows how far we've come with the tech in our pockets!
That notch bruh looks so old. Looks bigger than One+6 from 2018 😂
The iPhone is impressive and all but 11:43  live in my mind rent free😭😂
They need to get rid of that notch
11 Pro max being a good phone is too close to  13 Pro max in terms of performance & battery in this video. ✌🏻🤩
Os updates might be the battle companies use as everything else feels marginal upgrades 🤔
I just ordered mine and I will be getting it in a few weeks! I got the 13 pro max with 1T. Looking forward for the brighter screen.
0:19 I wanna know
My next phone will probably be the 14 in hopes of TouchID coming back. But over all I'm fond of the improvements! Specifically on Battery (2 day battery is a dream) and base storage for the 13. Great video honestly! Amazing job showing what the phones cameras can do also.
I want one so bad unfortunately my OnePlus 7 pro will have to do for 1 more year (my wallet can't take it)
Best review I’ve seen and actually sat all the way through.
Where is that beautiful village?
Doesnt look likr a 120hz for me
Battery life on my 13 pro max coming from a 7 plus is phenomenal. No complaints.
GENUINE POV: I bought the iPhone XS Max the day it came out 3 years ago and it STILL takes the same quality photos as the new iPhone 13 Pro Max. I tried it at Apple store last Friday here in SF. Apple is good at sprinkling new features onto their camera but at its core most of us stick to XS Max for a reason. The inky colors and clarity is no different than the new iPhone on a normal photo. But Apple needs to make money so marketing is their best friend. PLUS I still get all day battery life (this is my primary computer), it even has zero scratches on my case-less phone and WEIRDLY enough in direct sunlight side by side my 625 nits of brightness screen was brighter than the 1000 / 1200 nits of brightness screen on the new iPhone. Even an apple employee thought that was strange. Perhaps it’s the type of screen? The new iPhone is definitely worth getting if you have an iPhone 8 or less. But just wait until there’s no notch, a usb-c and wide angle in the front camera.
Thank you for genuine review
I just bought the 13 pro and upgraded from the 11 pro. It's a huge camera upgrade and I love mine!
Apple, get rid of the NOTCH it's 2021 🤦 Fortunately I went with Z Fold 3 this year
😳
😍
❤️
Multitasking 👍
13 pro
The best review I’ve ever seen!
Great review I  can watch even 20mins your very interesting and know more about technology
That freaking notch though 🤢🤮🤢🤮 And lighting port in 2021... really 🤔
Just ordered the Pro Max, I'm all about the big screen. Might be a bit annoying not to be able to use it one-handed (especially with young kids in arms constantly), but I'm sure I'll work it out. The bigger screen is an important for me. Great review, thanks.
good review. give me 1 iphone 13 pro max
I have never owned an Iphone in my life. I am currently using the S 21 Ultra, and I am going to pre order the pro max after watching this video
going from 7 to 13 P max xD
Jesus, if not for the blurry line around your hair i could not tell that this was shot on a phone, unreal.
My question is... Where was this filmed???
I have been using my 13 Pro Max for a week and it is simply a wonderful phone to use and so glad to carry it as my daily camera.
That notch is so ugly my god
Thumbs up if you are watching this on an iPhone 13 Pro Max
been an android user all my life, ive ordered my first iphone 13 pro Max yesterday after watching your review video should I still consider it? as its my first iphone
i must say that this phone is literally a masterpiece
Hey, great video as always.  I am constantly having issues on FCP with the iPhone HDR video.  What is it i need to do in order for the video file to look normal? Thanks
13 Pro Max!!!  The larger phone is better when you need to watch Netflix or videos on your phone.
The camera in the beginning looked excellent!!!!!!
i think the Cinematic Mode does look terrible - yes, start beating me. There is way too much Software going on, the fake edges around the person being recognized look like crap. This is not even physics, its all Software.
Awesome review, I will say the cinematic mode is actually incredible.
Great review, have the same phone (iPhone Pro Max 256GB) but in graphite.  Great review, well done
Good video👍
Dude you reviewing the same freaking iphone every year 🤣🤣 so lame
I really want to switch to Iphone from android this year (Switching from my Note 9, which is a fantastic phone).  The ONLY thing that is holding me back is the notch.  I am trying to decide if I think I will be able to ignore it once I have the phone.  The Note 9 is the last Samsung phone that didn't have a holepunch or notch.  It is an unbroken rectangle, and I love it!  Why the heck would you want a hole or notch in your screen? It looks horrible.  I'd rather just have a bezel and move the screen down a little, wtf apple!?   The only way I'm considering getting around it is to get the 13 Pro Max, and then basically if I don't fullscreen videos the screen size will still be the same as my note 9 if you subtract the notch area lol and act like it's a huge bezel
I believe you summed it up at the end, great phone, but to heavy/bulky. Adding a case on it makes it even a little bigger.
Mehh 12s fantastic 🔋 life and barely noticeable pro motion display to the average consumer! 🤔
Android user but I have to take my hat off to Apple, they make great phones.
Love the tarimetsu cake and coffee choices; prices are about the same as US. The background at many places are a bit fuzzy and  busy; but not bad for a phone. Thanks for showing me  London, UK, and castles and definitely keep going places while you review the devices.. Once again, great job on the video editing and presentation.
Video looks great. I wouldn't have known it wasn't shot on a professional camera. Did you have to do a lot in post to make it look this good?
Best Review So Far Hands Down❤️
Great review and I liked how you didn’t keep saying iPhone 13 pro max after every sentence.  … I watched a previous video and he said it at least 60 times.  Did you place a camera lense protector on the back during the video?
Seriously is all the same thing. No body will know the differences. It’s all about money.😂😂wake up apple just care about money.there is all the same .
Bro where do you live thats a beautiful area
Video quality was fantastic! I’ll be waiting for next year’s model with a whole new design (I hope).
Nice
Cant wait to update from 7plus to the 13 pro max
Great review, very precise and detailed. Personally I bought the pro max on release day and I couldn’t be happier. I strongly recommend!
I have the iphone XS…screen is too small when i want to watch youtube or browse the web.  Got the iphone 13 pro max this time
Mike Ross!!! That's who you remind me of, jesus that's been bugging me for 3 years.
That is off the hook
Amazing review love it 👍
Reading these comments, seems like I'm the only one that thinks the faux blurry background looks buggy and distracting. Bueller?
Can I get your WhatsApp number
I always use a protective cover and have iPhone 12 max. My upgrades have always gotten the highest trade in amount because I take care of my phone. I dont like taking my cover off unless phone runs hot. So charging over a protective cover has not worked on charge pads.
Great recording. I don’t like the removal of the charging port. God dam apple
This is one of the best reviews, an actual review, not another infomercial! Keep on with the great job
S21 ultra or this? I can get the s21 ultra for 240£ cheaper. Used android my whole life would really in the mood to try the latest iPhone. Apprecaite any advice
Cinematic mode is not too shabby but once you get used to better resolution video it looks lacking.
Switching from a note 10 plus which I still love with 0 issues till date even after 2 years. Not sure how much I'm going to regret this decision. 😂😂
Thanks. Excellent video. But im sticking with the 12 Pro Max. I'll wait for the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Do you think Apple will redesign their phones next year?
He wants me to say something stupid
The blue with the pink screen looks dope
Just bought it, cant wait until it arrives in 2 days, last iphone i bought was the iphone 6 plus
Hope apple will add a feature like high resolution mode. Should be possible with a shifting sensor. Nice for landscaping
The same phone with different Variants . Need to inform the TVA ASAP .
Sitting with a 12 Max here, the cameras aren’t the biggest leap ever in an iPhone. Maybe the new features make it look like, but in terms of quality, I don’t get excited of it over my 12 Max. And cameras is my main reason for iPhone upgrades.
He meant, of course, moving from the dark side.
What game is that..? At 2.18
Wells?
This is my first IPhone ever and I am LOVING it.
New subscriber. Brilliant video and best review video so far
I’m glad I watched this review. I’ve been watching a lot of iPhone PM reviews this past week and I typically agree with everything, and every video just reaffirms my desire for the PM. But what I didn’t agree with is when he said he wished for more customization options. I’m currently using the iPhone 11 PM and one of the biggest things that I LOVE about this phone is actually the LACK of customizations. It’s sort of a breath of fresh air when I transitioned from Samsung to Apple because I didn’t have all these things I needed to turn off and on, and things to make my phone “my own.” If Apple started taking more pages from everyone else’s book, they wouldn’t really be standing out anymore because they’d be a mix of this and that, and sometimes, that’s too much. I don’t think we need so many customization options, but that’s just me. Otherwise, I really enjoyed this video!
Shot on iphone. Music starts
Excellent presentation - Thank you.👍
Hey bro, Got a iPhone 12 Pro Max should I upgrade?
You bring us here for review but you start compere it with other just for longer video
Hi great video and info,,,I'm watching this AFTER ordering the iphone 13 pro 512 Gb (not max) yesterday, moving from android for the 1st time ever, phew am I relieved or what after watching this
bloody hell mate buy a case.
Great info. Thank you
Great video. I've currently have a Note 10 plus and am thinking of getting either a 13 Pro or 13 Pro Max. I also have an Active 2 watch so will no doubt get a Apple watch at some stage if I switch. Will I miss any features of the N10+? Not really sure as it's basically a glorified app launcher for me (I don't use: split screen, Dex, customise the screen, hardly use the unreliable on screen fingerprint scanner, etc). What I do need though is long battery life. Interesting times.
We've come to the point where we're telling people to stay away from bigger phones. Mobile reviews really have come full circle
still kinde rapped up. Like I'm an android user and would love to try a Iphone. Just don't know for sure. Losing the cutommasation is sad but I don't use it a lot anyway. idk
Great review, I think you pointed out the most important stuff in the video and you also hit the nail in the head in regards to size.   My wife decided to switch to the iPhone 13 Pro Max after having a S20 FE 5G for the last year or so. I myself pack a S21 Ultra. My wife felt a bit dissapointed in her upgrade, she hates the weight of the phone obviously she thinks the screen is pretty to look at but there is one thing she cannot get past by, and that is the screen animations. On Android we usually turn off screen animations or tone them down to 0.5x of the speed. However, with the iPhone these animations feel like they take forever and even though they are pretty, its not practical enough. As she says, when she wants to do something now, it has to happen 'now'.  We tried the camera and felt people are overhyping the iPhone. Sure it did take brilliant photos we messed with the different filters, video etc but at the end of the day, this phone didn't 'wow' us and made us realise these almost year old Samsung phones do the same job at similar quality. There are other nitpicks and she did love some things I haven't mentioned (she thought gaming was absolute bliss on it since its fast, much faster than our Samsungs).  She has now returned her iPhone 13 Pro Max and we are now awaiting Google and Samsung to see what they can come up with.
Some people say the s21 ultra camera better its whatever you into both great phones
Moved over myself mate, been on Android since the Sony Xperia X10, switched to Galaxy S2, currently on S10 plus, but waiting for delivery on my iPhone 13 pro max, can’t wait
This looks like it was filmed near Salisbury.. but then again all of England looks the same😂
Filled in wells nice!
Sort your mic out ridiculous
Nice and all, but the Bokeh looks awful - very superficial...
Thank you for mentioning lens flare , i Justine also showed some quick camera pics with the 13 pro max and one particular shot did show up nasty lens flare , hopefully apple can tune this up a bit because it was and is a problem on the 12 models too , i have thrown away quite a few shots due to iphone lens flare .  The iphones still have good cameras  , but I certainly wouldn’t be throwing out  your Sony Alpha camera .
I think the video quality is pretty great! thanks mate!
They’re just tricking the masses into giving these giant companies a $1000+ every year for stupid upgrades. Nah, I’m not participating in the scam. I buy a new phone every 6 years and nothing will change that.
I loovee big phones so 13 pro max if i were to upgrade. However i do feel 6.7 inch is a bit too much like I personally have an 11 pro max and it is perfect for my hands with a case that is. So 13 pro max will become a bit too difficult to use in my opinion but then again content consumption will be amazing on the phone. So it has its ups and downs…
I upgraded to the iPhone 13 Pro Max after having the 11, the difference is insane.
Well done awesome video I’ve only had the phone for two days but what an upgrade from my 10 max and the trade-in of $1000 is unheard of best promotion I’ve ever seen
This review made me want to buy this phone even though I already have the S21 Ultra 512gb/ 16gb variant
i just bought my iphone 13 pro max 1026GB :)
one of the best review of iPhone 13 pro max
Man has got over 6k mails
WoW🤩✨
Great video! You earned a new sub with bell with this one! The video looks GREAT to my perhaps not-so-discerning old eyes.  I have an iPhone X that I bought right when the X came out, and it has served me very well. It's still pretty snappy, and I don't really notice any significant lags using it for what I use for - including watching LOTS of YT videos.   Your video pretty much convinced me that if I upgrade to the iPhone 13, it will be to the 13 Pro - not the Pro Max. I've also watched all of Arun's videos on the iPhone 13.   My wife has an iPhone XR (I think... I can't keep all of the models straight!)... anyway it's the BIG one because she likes the big screen. That phone is just NOT comfortable for me to hold at all, and it's not really very pocketable at all. My iPhone X is the perfect size for me because it's easy to hold and use, and the battery would be a HUGE improvement over my iPhone X's aging battery that struggles to make it through several hours since charging. It's very pocketable, and the 13 Pro is in that same size range..  My biggest challenge now is deciding whether to spring for the 13 Pro now, or make do with my X for another year until the NEXT iPhone gen arrives. Hopefully that will be a truly compelling watershed  moment. I have pretty much become fed up with the "upgrade every year or two because the new iPhones are just SO much better than what I have now" life. I would LOVE to have all of the new camera functions of the 13 Pro, and the much better battery life. I can get the 13 Pro by upgrading my Verizon iPhone X for $16-something/mo for the 512GB 13 Pro, or $20-something/mo for the 1TB 13 Pro. In that regard, an extra $20/mo to get the massively-better 13 Pro 1TB seems a no-brainer. Maybe I just convinced myself to do it. BUT, I would also need a new case, new screen protector, and new charger - which is about $150 or so additional cost.
Nice video...thanks
Is this the apple phone worth upgrading to even though I have always owned android phones?
Very nice Phone I hope to buy it Someday 😇🙏
Wonder why the iPhone 14 shows recessed lenses… lens flare is why. Failed again Apple
Quality is pretty good, but the edge bur with cinematic is very noticeable I wish they'd tone that down
Oh wow. I'm not an iPhone fan but that video quality in cinematic mode looks incredible.
wooow!!
I bought the 13 Pro Max. For the size watching a video, and the much longer battery life (I can go a whole day of use with no worries). The camera improvements are great oo.
It hurts seeing the back glass :(
Every reviewer is saying the phones are thicker but, it’s the same thickness as the Xs Max so it really isn’t that much of a deal? Apart from that a great vid and an amazing phone!
Does any know what game that is @ 4:42? Appreciate the help
I M new subscriber pls give me your old phone 📱
Cinematic mode is a fail and underwhelming not to mention the fake 120Hz! Just my two cents 🤭
I'm on the s9 and deciding on whether to get this or the xperia 1 iii. Could use some help with it
Great review 🙏
Never liked the photography portrait mode, just looks enormously fake, the cinematic version looks even worse. Nothing beats the bokeh of a proper lens.
4:06 - "Long animation times" imagine thinking that refresh rate has any impact on animation times. this guy! :D LOL
Suddenly my apps freezes in13 pro max any one has the same problem
I’m upgrading from the OnePlus 7 Pro to the 13 Pro Max. I’m really excited
I may be returning 13 pro max. Not super thrilled with battery life. I think 5g is killing it
Update is coming 😊😊
The best review ever 👏🏼
what I like you video scale like Cinema , What is your Video Aspect Ratios?
There's no manual hdr control in photo mode, i hate when they remove stuff without telling. I sold my iphone 12 pro max and bought iphone 13 pro , had i known that i would've never done that. Plus i can't have close ups of subjects anymore because it switches to macro mode , and the bokeh from the main sensor disappears... this is not an update this is a downgrade if you ask me
Great review Tom!  I’m currently using the 11Pro and looking to update to the 13Pro Max, it was interesting you said you’d recommend the 13Pro over the Max🤔.  I’m looking to get the bigger screen for watching content and longer battery life, but I am worried about the extra size and weight as my hands aren’t particularly large and the Pro is comfortable at the moment.
Hi TC, Please reveal the locations used for your review. It’s beautiful and I’d love to take my family there! Thanks for such detailed content.
Thank you soo much for reviewing the cameras capabilities.
I got the iPhone 13 Pro Max on Friday. So far I can’t tell much difference from my 12 Pro Max…
I've had my 13 pro for a few days now, was always thinking about getting the max but chickened out cuz of the weight...
The forced blur in the cinematic mode is kind of annoying it’s fine in pictures for a blurred background but on video it’s unattractive imo
what's the monitor you use on your bench? looks stunning
Shame I phone still not able to remove that ugly notch at the top
Great review. I've gone for the 13 Pro. Opening shots... is that Gloucestershire?
Hi Sir. Can I get your wallpaper in Iphone 13 Pro Blue? Thank you.
the iPad was jealous you were spending more time with the iPhone
I placed my iphone 13 pro max on table with face down then after a minute or two I picked up and touch dont work for 30 seconds. Anyone else have this problem? Or is this actually a problem or some setting. Appreciate if someone could help.
Real nice images.
I’m upgrading because my storage is full I have 12 pro max 256 and don’t want to delete anything and have to pay monthly storage. Getting the 1 tb storage
I refuse to buy an expensive big notch with a phone attached to it. That thing is too ugly for my cash.
Is the lens flare on the 13 the same on the 12 or improved? For me on the 12 i hated when i took photos indoors in rooms with lighting and the lights would twinkle someone on the photo.
You’re so cute OMG I’m in love 😍
My pro max 13 is in the Mail🤣 from a pro max 11….. so it should be a good decent upgrade….
Completely shocked that this was filmed on a 13 Pro. I honestly would not have known had you not have said anything. Went with the 13 Pro Max and not sure if I want to keep that or go to the 13 Pro as the size is a bit too big for me but the battery life is...omg.
Pro Res is coming to the 128GB, just at 1080p.
The video looks amazing…great job!
I love the s21 ultra but am not sure if I should upgrade to 13 pro max only downside to iphones is that the USB C is missing and multi tasking
Ugh now you've confused me between pro and pro max 😂 I'm coming from a Samsung Note10 and I feel like pro will seem smaller for me specially with the notch. But pro max looks heavier and uncomfortable to hold. What do you think?
Excuse me pegion Sir 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Great video.
Can I get your old iPhone? My phone is full of storage and I can’t film any videos for my channel 😭
And now we waiting for a new iPhone next year 😎
Can’t decide if I want the sierra blue or the gold. Both look really awesome to me.
The actual video quality is really good
The only reason why I am willing to switch to iPhone is because normally phones last me 5 years and I know Apple provides good support for their phones. However, I will wait for the Samsung Galaxy S22 next year before I decide.
pro max here
Never used iPhone 😐
The 13 Pro Max actually charges up to 27-28W via cable. It’s been tested using wattage meter.
When I go to safari and look to see what trackers are trying to track me and I see google  at the top of the list 4 different times it confirms why I won’t ever go to android and for me that is worth the extra money that iPhones cost.
I get it’s a tech channel but ppl who buy every new iPhone are crazy…when I was young I had a slide phone and I was lucky…after that it was a cheap Samsung then a Samsung s6 then back to cheap lg phones coz that phone vanished …then it was my sisters old iPhone 6 then it was this current iPhone xs… and I don’t plan on upgrading till either iPhone 15 or a compelling Samsung or lg phone down the line
I really hope these phones can get thinner😥 Surprised at the video/audio quality considering this was shot on the new iPhone.
Great review.  I have ordered mine 13 pro max. Can't wait to my hands on it.
🙄😕😐 12:00 no. The iPhone pro max needs to be bigger.   How about you stick with smaller phones 📱 since that bothers you!
Iphone 13 pro max VS Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra
Looks the same like the 12
Pro max 👍
“Worst outro ever….” - Cameraman James 😂
Go big or go home…Pro Max all the way for me! Got it on launch day and am loving it 😍 Great video Tom, some lovely shots of Wells there 😉
Everything I hear about batteries is that fast charging is bad for the overall health of the battery. It‘s probably why Apple is against it.
It's kind of like Android was a few years back. It was exciting times
Quality on the phone video seems decent. If you hadn't said anything, i wouldn't have noticed to look.
I just got my white/silver iphone 13 pro max in the mail yesterday and i'm so in love with it!!! I did an unboxing on my channel as well. Such a great phone and the camera quality?!?? STUNNING.
very good quality video... you can tell James to resign :))
12:51 here you can see how smooth that 120Hz refresh screen is, even though it's only 60fps video :)))
What can you say about the color after longer time of use? don’t it anoying or geting bored? wondering with what color can i go for a long time and stay safe. Really like this color, second is silver and the third is graphite!
I really like that you didn't go for yhe clickbaity title and also, Halfway through I forgot that this video was shot on the iPhone 13 :o, Like it's really good✨
Video looked great man
Comming from 12 switching to 13 pro max, want a bigger one and need the macro cam back anddd the 120 hz, i had all that on my onrplus 8 pro
I love your cat. And the way you review. But I can't cut my eyes from the cat🤣
Best review of iphone 13, nice job mate. Already got a max in gold, loving it
Getting the silver 13 pro :)
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🎈
I got the Graphite iPhone 13 Pro Max and I’m so excited! My iPhone XR hasn’t been working 😒
I’ve always been an S upgrade person and was hoping that they’d continue th S naming scheme this year but it looks like Apple isn’t doing that anymore. I’m currently using an iPhone XS Max and upgrading to the 13 Pro Max this year.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🎈
Ipads have a bigger screen so split screen makes more sense. I don't use split screen or multi window on any of my Android phones. Even when u had to root and jailbreak your phone to get it. Screen is just too small. I carry 2 phones, work with 2 monitors, have my phones on me when Im watching on my OLED tv. People need to stop complaining about it and that phones are too big. We finally got away from skinny phones with small batteries. Now with all the complaining you get huge phone that folds with a small battery. If a suv is too big for you buy the size that suits u. Just like if u wear medium shirts u don't complain that there's a store called Big and Tall.
btw. Are you using a case? I got my 13 pro on the way but I hate using cases
The cinematic mode looks amazing. They just need to fix the blurriness around the focused object
He's excited to switch bc of the 120hrz and battery lol... Features we have all seen years ago but for him is new... One last question... How much space did you use to record ProRes.. And the way it looks is bad.. Blurs your hair and isn't perfect... When something isn't great, we don't need to brag about it
Thank you so much. I have an S21U and I was looking for this video with an honest perspective from an android user. I'm excited to switch (😅) to this iPhone. Greetings from Mexico.
R u reviewing camera or phone 📱??
I just ordered mine 5 mins ago
You are a good you tuber lot better then zollo tech keep up the good work mate
Just a waste of money if you buy the I phone 13 more money than sence
I’m pretty sure the 128gb 13 Pro models will still get Pro-Res but only in 1080. The 256gb and up will do 4k.
The battery life is the most exciting thing for me! More flagships need a battery this good.
Why upgrade? 12pro max does the job. Wait till the 14
Gift me an iPhone 13 pro max😅
That looks like he's walking around Wells. Lovely place. Not too bothered about the phone but nice to see Wells.
Great review, I’m debating whether to upgrade my 11 Pro Max to the 13 Pro or wait for the next Samsung release…
The size is huge...I bought for my wife Iphone 13 Pro, but even compare with X, it seems X is better in hand....
I just purchased the Gold 13 Pro Max 1TB
I actually forgot for most of the video that it was shot on the iphone
No doubt Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max cinematic mode are amazing.. Apple are best implementation of Cinematic Mode
Care less about the phone. I'm more Curious where you're at.
dropped a like on this for dropping the clickbait
appreciate you shot the whole video on the 13 Pro. it‘s capabilities are quite good, although I guess everyone can see its weaknesses. But remember the Portrait feature on iPhones camera 4 years ago? let‘s give this technology another 4 years and see where we are then 😜 Thank you for the video - had fun watching it.
This was a great review. I particularly appreciated the camera section which was totally relevant on this occasion even though I'm looking at getting the smaller Pro model, which is identical for once (in terms of the camera specs).  I'm quite chuffed to have a found a quality new [to me] channel here, cheers.
This video was filmed on the iPhone 13 pro max… mind fkn blown just wow
That is a great review
I really don't impress by the photos and videos. They look quite overexposed to me.
Great review ! I’m a college student that needs a new phone just ordered the 13 pro max wish my 7 plus didn’t go out on me.
I dont like the girl who took a selfie with you just because I like you and she's too pretty :(
Hey Chaps, do you sell the phones after you make reviews with them?
Wells is so pretty
The cinematic mode is nice, not like other smartphone,
iPhone 13 battery test shows a marked improvement on a weak spot of the previous generation. Also iPhone 13 Pro has a noticeably smoother screen than the 12 Pro. Once you experience a 120Hz display, it's hard to go back to a 60Hz one.
Same talk  like most YouTubers = Lazy results . Sorry:)
I always love your reviews very honest in my opinion
I'm buying the Sierra blue iphone 13 pro
Nice review 👍😄
I just ordered the pro max 256 gb version🙂
that bokeh effect is not ready for prime time. still a gimmick to me
Wonderful review 👌👍
Anyone find the blur background very strange ?
a bit too much negativity, Im afraid. :/
You'd get a thumbs up from me for resisting the temptation to put a clickbait title alone! Great review
Best review that I saw so far. Thanks
*Hey, to you reading* ..... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Great review! You can tell the video is filmed on a phone camera. That cinematic mode is not very impressive.
Hit wit a hammer? Drop test it.
Give to me😭😭😪🥺
Quality of the pro max looks stunning, can’t wait to get mine.
If I want to take professional pictures I'll just buy camera. If I want a phone with a good camera I'll just buy a Samsung
I thought I clicked a Tom Scott video for a second
Excellent review. Got my pro max on order :)
I didn’t think I would tell much of a difference between the the 12 pro max vs the 13 pro max. Ideally though, for me.. someone that is a photographer and a power user I can tell a massive difference in what I do.  Sounds better.. camera seems to be run quite a bit better… just from preliminary tests laying in a hospital bed w covid. And yes that’s the truth lol.  Apps are snappy (even older non optimized ones) and let’s not forget there is still updates to iOS that are coming. The best is yet to come imo. Especially for us power users. The difference is noticeable, I think peoples standards are just way to high for what you’re you want.  Lastly, you’re not paying full price for a new phone. You’re selling your old and replacing with a new one. After trade in, I’m paying 550 for my iPhone 13 pro max - the upgrades for 550? Do the math! Well worth it.
was the photos taken in wells?
Nice video mate xx what the place called you where shooting in please  ?
Facing a conundrum here, am given a choice to choose either one.  iPhone 13 Pro Max or iPad Pro? FYI: I am currently using iPhone 12 Pro, and Macbook Pro M1.  So what should I choose??
잘 봤습니다. 감사합니다~^^
Excellent review 🔥👍 I will still chose Android over Apple 🍏
Thats a very good vid quality. I haven't even notice until you said it. Great review sir👏👏👏
When is this phone coming out in the uk because I’ve searched it up and it doesn’t say anything ffs
Upgrading to iphone 13 pro max when they are back in stock 🥲
Is there a need for expensive cameras anymore when the quality is this good on a phone? Excellent review btw. I’d love to upgrade but I’m still recovering financially from buying the CX OLED from one of your other reviews. Excellent work. 👍
That cinematic mode looks silly :) It looks like a green screen and some cheap effects. I wonder if the prores raw recording will show you the actual real unsharpened performance? That would be interesting. As i think these lenses cant really handle even half of the pixels.
Just ordered the pro max today after many many years as a loyal Samsung Note user. Loved the fast charge and was a bit anxious about losing that feature and now you just confirmed my fear lol.
So Jane's out of a job? Which "job"? You gonna snuggle up to your new iPhone 13 Pro Max on a cold winter's night so the big battery can keep you warm? Good luck with that. My wife has ordered the Pro Max. I wonder if she will be entirely happy with an even bigger screen. We'll see next month I guess.
great great review man.... waiting for the iphone 13 review now...
Love it and definitely getting 13pro max
What is this game 2:10
13 pro it is good choice
Maybe it's because I'm used to DSLR but I straight away noticed it. So unnatural, not only the cutting of the bokeh but the bokeh itself and I don't know, the picture itself is still.... hmm... "phonish".
Music Videos are gonna be shot on the Pro version using cinematic mode lol
The quality of the video is great (I didn’t watch it in 4k but seriously I thought it’s shot on a Sony camera)
I'm currently using an S21 Ultra and thinking of getting my hands on my very first iPhone ever. Now I'm torn between the 12 Pro and the regular 13. In my country, I could get the 12 Pro for a slightly cheaper price (~60usd). Which one should I get???   I really love the design of the 12 Pro (esp in pacific blue) plus the versatility of the telephoto lens, but the better battery and camera on the 13 are soooo tempting.
Okay I'm real me user
oh now. Its only one weeek use and broke back
Does the photography styles exist on the normal iPhone 13?
Liked the review but you look like a bum in the thumbnail
What game was that called 2:12
Video is very good quality, interest in how you mike'd up to the iphone or was that in post?
Same shhh as the other
that cinematic mode looks crap
I think the 128 GB model doest get proress support but only 30 FPS 1080p no 4k
Sorry for the question, but when recording videos (no cinematic mode) how do you switch cameras? I saw in the movie (09:35) that during the recording it passes between the cameras but to me with iphone 13 pro it does not. also if I am recording 1x with the wide angle and I zoom at 3x it is clear that it is a digital zoom and it is not using the telephoto lens. How do you solve this problem. Thank you
Looks good but I'm waiting for the s23 ultra, using s21 ultra atm
Very informative! I’m definitely going to upgrade especially to use for my content creation 🤞🏽 thanks again!
That is a great review
I’ve always been an S upgrade person and was hoping that they’d continue th S naming scheme this year but it looks like Apple isn’t doing that anymore. I’m currently using an iPhone XS Max and upgrading to the 13 Pro Max this year.
Can someone tell me when will apple having a stock of iphone 13 and iphone 13 pro?
Every year give a 1000e for phone and no problem... You are up to date!
I received my IPhone Pro Max today to replace my XS Max and it’s fantastic so far. The 120hz display is phenomenal. I agree it’s not the most comfortable phone to hold without a case but a nice soft case will fix that.
When Tom said he is transitioning, I nearly drowned from my lemonade. Congratulations, though 😜😜😜
Love your 👀
Just bought mine... $2024 later.... ( I live in Australia)... Australia is the BIGGEST rip off.
The main problem with it is that it runs iOS. Once you're used to virtually unlimited customization and personalization with Android, not to mention even something as basic as always on display, iOS seems like a joke.
Got my 13 Pro last Saturday, I haven’t tested the cinematic mode yet, but damn! Can’t believe this video was shot with just an iPhone! I’m loving my 13 Pro so far! I’m coming from the Galaxy Note 9.
5:38 the main issue is the price factor. 4-5 years with 1 iPhone or 2-3 android phones at the same price together with the proper battery health. I choose android because I`m borred with phones and need to change every 2 years.
Was watching this on my TV. Have to say, some of the filming you did on the phone made me dizzy (particularly the bit on the street outside at the start). Felt like being very drunk. When it's moving, the camera seems to have a noticeable  "bobbing on the sea" effect, which made me feel a bit seasick!  Apart from that, some very nice results, but was it just me or do some of the pictures seem too pale?
Please tom make battery drain test you promise
NO AOD, WTF!
6 gigs a minute for prores lol Jesus!
1:07 of course any one who has some experience with DSLR/Mirrorless can easily spot out that crazy fringing near you hair line. Sony Xperia 1 mark II does a better job, not because it has a better software (which if course it doesn't) but that phone has a very versatile pro photo mode, not something like iPhone's gimmicky *"CINEMATIC MODE"* .
Dude not gonna lie, you have the hottest girlfriend on god's green earth.
As a Photographer i confirm that , iPhone 13 Pro/Max camera is not as good as its shown 🙏 and this video is just another indirect promotion.  Note :- In recent test its revealed that iPhone 13 Pro/Max screen refresh at 90Hz ,( not 120hz)
I completely agree about the 13Pro and the Apple eco system in being the main reason I finally moved entirely over from Android to Apple. I used to be a staunch Android guy but I’m not looking back now as everything is working perfectly for my work flow and just daily life 👌🏼
Great vedio as always,,loved it.. ❤️ By the way what is your monitor model ?
Hmm u look like Tom hiddleton
the reason why I’m upgrading from an iPhone 12 Pro 256GB (Silver) to The iPhone 13 Pro Max 512GB (Sierra Blue)📱 for the 120 Hz refresh rate and the improved cameras
8:11  the lady: ???????
yo, why does the notch have the earpiece centered and not at the top? looks, fake man
I have an Iphone 6 with a cracked screen, should I upgrade?
Tech chap ft Mrwhosetheboss
Strongly disagree with the camera being the best nor it being the best phone, but sure, exagerating is good for your market.
Truth be told, whatever Samsung does is always undermined.
As much as I dislike Apple and their ecosystem, they do have amazing video capabilities on their phones!! Really hope Google step up!! 🤞 Great video Tom!
Great
We can't wait for iPhone 14
nice vide0
I barely touched my iPhone 13 pro max against a wall and the back shattered. I think you should have been more honest about the weakness of the back glass.
The bokeh effect is awful though, kept blurring your hairline all the time =/  Oh, and no amount of features or good camera can make me change to an iPhone, not worth being subjected to "Apple knows what best for everyone", maybe one day they will let us customize our own experience a bit more. The hardware has been great for you years though, it's only iOS that I can't stand.
How about the LENS FLARE??!!!! Why you are HIDING it ??!!! Why you are LYING??!!! Did Apple Pay you to hide the LENS FLARE ISSUE???!
Opening (0:05 - 0:35) really looks like photoshopped video.
It doesnt matter if battery is good while we have brand new device,ofcourse it will be good,i wonder about battery life after 7- 8 months with hravy usage with 120 hz always in.I know its adaptive,but still.....
One of my dreams but very expensive
What game is that at 4.45!  Amazing video btw. Confirms my decision of getting a pro max
I can't believe the whole video was captured by the iphone. They've nailed it
I went upgraded from the iPhone 12 to the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Going from the iPhone 12 to the 13 for me was not enough reason to upgrade; I wanted a bigger battery/screen, the 120hz display, the Macro Camera and just something different. Going from a 6inch iPhone to almost 7inch iPhone is a world of difference in terms of viewing content, experience, and just enjoyment of using an ios device. Being pegged as the best phone camera system, I would have to say that its the best iPhone camera experience. The phone though is slippery to the touch and would highly recommend some form of a case for the phone as I would anticipate dropping the phone quite often. The phone was definitely worth the upgrade.
Would you choose iPhone 13 Pro 256 GB or iPhone 13 Pro Max 128 GB?  I am torn between these two.
Only been 5 days for me, lol.
这哥们是哪的人？ 后面的建筑好有年代感
Wait for 14
hectic 🤘🏽

Me with my 8+ I’ve had for 3 years👁👄👁
Cinematic mode looks really usable for beginner youtubers, with some tinkering, shooting at maybe f8 or f7.1, just slightly blurring, some colour grade, luts, can do some convincing short stories.  Even when shooting with canon 5d back then, the blur on f4 is just enough to focus on the subject and the story.
Apple's edge detection sucks ass.
Please do a 13 Pro vs. 13 Pro Max comparison?
iPhone 13pro max batter is awesome  Pixel 6 pro enters the room = the greatest
HOW much did apple pay you to give this LOB sided positive Review ???
already shifted from android this year  had a galaxy note 10 plus bought an iPhone 13 Pro Max  Don't have it yet though lol
You dropped your iPad on your iPhone n it broke your screen. WOW 😂
I love stevejobs I love Apple 🍎
Oten reveal po lods
Yes the iPhone looks really good, (even if your getting apple fan boyish lol).. I'm still lovin my s21 ultra n android eco system, as saf says its your own personal preference at the end of the day..
13 PM wins for me ! But it's a long wait 45 days here
Since everyone trying to buy either 12 or 13. I'm going to buy 7. Just for app testing.
Man, if you could tell us which shots were in 4K 30 or 4K 24 that weren't cinematic mode it would be super helpful to all of us who want to make content That looks as good as yours. I personally found the obvious cinematic shots to look a little digitized but some of the non cinematic mode shots were Crisp and just beautiful looking.
I have no reason to upgrade from my 12 Pro Max but I still kind of want to because of the 120 hz display.
Longevity - you say this literally for every iPhone released every year.. yet you kinda passively persuade people to upgrade from an year old phone 🤷🏼‍♂️
The cinematic mode was disappointing, I guessed it was filmed with the iphone because the blur was changing weirdly not naturally and sometimes it even blur your hair or part of your head. Didn't seem natural. Besides that the video is really good, I think the cinematic mode needs to improve
what game was he playing?
Very nice job and review, thanks for posting!
Drop the wallpapers man 😩
It will be nice for it not to force the lens.
Sooner my iPhone wil get deivered
Link to the wallpaper?
CAN'T WAIT YOU BUY IPHONE 13 TO PLAY CANDY CRUSH
I wish I have phone 🙁🇵🇭
I am finally upgrading from a Galaxy note 9 which has been amazing for 3 years. Still undecided if I should upgrade to a Iphone 13 Pro or S22U.  Thoughts?
Imo, the most impressive thing was the standard 4k footage of him sitting by the computer narrating the video. It shows that this can be used convincingly as a pro camera to record simple youtube videos.
The fact that you used the phone's camera for this entire video says it all
Wait what!? The WHOLE video is shot on iPhone? I actually thought it was just partially shot with the iPhone😳
where is this location please?
So loki in his free  time doing camera review.😅
Great video, answer to question? I’m watching this on my 13 pro max. Love it. Not a fanboy. Just like something that always works flawless!!!!
scared me a little cuz i got the max and you said you wouldn’t recommend it 😭
The lens flare drives me nuts
This should be the iphone review in the year 2020, well some are late to the party always and that's apple for you,
The best iPhone 13 review I have seen and I have seen a Tonne
excuse me pidgeon,,, lmao
Cinematic videography has so much problem! It’s not good as it supposed to be! I think Apple needs much better cameras and definitely better LiDAR to help for a better cinematic videography! Also 1080p 30fps is not good at all! We are not making movies or videos for Instagram! Not good enough for YouTube at all!
Upgraded from the 7plus to the 13 pro max, I agree with the size can be abit bulky in the pocket, but I do love the big screen, battery 🔋 is crazy good, still haven’t been able to run it down 😂
This is the new James Bond phone, nuff said.  Fantastic video quality, truly Cinematic.
1:22 cute cat
hope in 36c summer it dims screen to a black screen as 12 pro max does so after browsing internet for a few minutes or recording a minute of 4k video you don't know if screen is on or off 😂
Great video review. I’m happy with my gold iphone 13 Pro! Perfect size, especially since I have the iPad Pro 11” for when I need something bigger.  Great combo. And damn, in my opinion the gold looks even more fire this year 🔥
For Battery, I’d always hand it over to Samsung. iPhone battery depression is fast on every update. It lasts longer now, but after a year, its the worst. Samsung keeps the battery in an okay state.
That slower charging is a good thing. It means your phone’s battery health will last longer. If it lasts you through the day and you have overnight to charge this shouldn’t be an issue.
Does anyone know the race game he was playing in the beginning when talking about battery life?
" Want to trade , iphone 13 for petrol... Or some toilet paper rolls " UK this winter , brought to you by Brexit.
That cinematic mode.. 🤢 no bueno
thank you very much
I ordered my 13 Pro Max just a few days ago, and this video still surprised me with the quality and performance I can expect. Wow. Thanks, Tom!  I hope you are doing well!
The battery ia not as big as an andriod phone but the iphones efficiency is very good
4:43 Fps and Hz are two different scales. One describes the frames per second supplied by your gpu while the other describes the panels refresh rate. Having these number match on the other hand is preferred as both these scales are in reference to 1 Second.
Thanks 😊 🫂 alot for the great and perfect content ever on YouTube, love your videos alot ❤ bro. Keep up the good 💪 👷‍♂️.  BTW I want your cracked iPhone 12 Pro max, I will be happy I get it 😊
I really felt there’s something odd on that initial shot and i thought, wow that’s so cinematic. But it didn’t really occur to me that it’s shot by phone and that 1080p cap is still pretty much workable i guess with just enough light. I wish there’ll be update and they’ll amp up the cinematic to 4k coz that there is really great.
ProRes is available on the base 128gb iPhone PM. It’s just limited to 1080
Man, how far smartphone cameras have come! I really wouldn't have guessed you shot the entire video on a phone! Apart from the occasional mis-bluring of your hair, the footages were impeccable!
Very detailed video. Thanks and all my questions answered 💪🏾
This was a good video but in my opinion all the videos I see the people doing iPhone 13 reviews they're biased to the iPhone but yet they're saying oh we wish you had this and that because Samsung has it and I always say what's the best phone is the best phone as far as the iPhone but in reality there's a lot of people saying the same thing about Samsung it just depends on what your ecosystem is. With that being said Samsung clearly doesn't get enough love on the internet every time an iPhone comes out everybody and their mom has to do all these videos about iPhone this iPhone that it's like apple is screaming at you buy this by this by this where Samsung doesn't really have to do much talking they do one or two adverts and let the phone speak for itself it doesn't need crazy fanfare or recognition it has a cold following because it does everything that users need to do it well. With that being said I'm a note user but these phones are more geared toward business professionals and people that do a lot of moving files and want a PC you like situation or a Chromebook type situation and if you're used to that and you want more customization Samsung's the way to go. As far as the cameras go both of them have hit or miss options and a cinematic mode is quite gimmicky on the iPhone kind of like space zoom was gimmicky on Samsung again these are all first iterations I'm sure down the line in the next 3-4 years they'll have something comparable to dslrs or mirrorless cameras but for your average Joe buy whatever phone you like based on the ecosystem you use.
The S21 Ultra seems to be better than the 13PM. Better screen, memory, cameras, speed... And have the pros and cons of Android.
You really bought a gaming chair? 😅 I've never found a good one, going for the Markus IKEA chair instead, but I'd be interested to hear your take on it. 😊
cinematic shoot just a gimmick i think, no one will use it on everyday use.. be fair the best video on smartphone is iPhone.. everything else is standard
Is that Wells Cathedral?
Would appreciate you doing a video on Apple’s future snooping update(security back door for governments).
Awesome review like always, I totally agree that the iPhone 13 pro/pro max 120 hz and camera performance with the fantastic eco system makes this phone excell. The deal breaker for many android users including myself will definitely be the absence of a fingerprint sensor and the usb type c. I will also add the presence of the annoying notch and the unavailability of the handy Android features as multitasking, scroll capturing and camera software options.
No luck catching them swans then?
Just order it and look uglier than my single lense iphone.
that bokeh in cinematic looks so gimmky
video quality is good. exept the blur around the head sometimes. Then you see its fake Bokeh
I'd say the cinematic mode doesn't quite nail the edge detection but the standard shots are pretty good.
I had a 13 Pro Max for a little bit but I exchanged it for a Pro instead. I like the more portable size and a bit of less weight. Both phones are amazing tho, I'm happy after upgrading from a XS Max
Love the quality of the vid! I agree with the 13 Pro Recommendation, and think it’s the sweet spot in terms of size, whilst incorporating the higher end functionality, for a slightly lower price. It’ll likely be my next upgrade.
I’ve always been an S upgrade person and was hoping that they’d continue th S naming scheme this year but it looks like Apple isn’t doing that anymore. I’m currently using an iPhone XS Max and upgrading to the 13 Pro Max this year.
I've ordered a Pro max and will be going back to the Apple eco system after 2 years on a Huawei P30 pro.
Great review! I can't decide if I need the Max? What made you choose the Max over the regular pro?
Haven't used a iPhone sence the 6s plus and il be getting one in a few weeks so il have to go for the plus size
I Order the iphone 13 pro max,gonna switch from iPhone 6s to 13 pro max 😂😎
I liked the fact that you didn't edit the part that you mistook the phones but I really wouldn't mind having the 12pm, had like to switch to iPhone for a change
I go for the normal 13. Saving the cash for 14 pro with usb-c and hopefully small or no notch😉
Thx but I don’t understand. You wish the Pro max was a bit smaller, well go for the 13 Pro with same hardware🤷🏼‍♂️
is it me or the audio is ahead of the video.
Got my 13 Pro max on Friday. Really impressed with Camera and battery life but 120hz feels so much smoother on my s21 ultra than iPhone.
I won't be buying the 13 Pro Max that I desperately want until they update the software to prevent automatic lens switching. For example, the 3x lens will automatically switch to the 1x camera and apply a digital crop to present a similarly framed, but very low quality image. Or the 1x camera will automatically switch to the 0.5x and digitally crop. This is even worse than Apple Maps! Lens lock does not affect anything outside video.
iPhone 13 pro max for me all the way, it's a nice niche between a smart phone and iPad.
Would say that new blue is pastel like? Can people own it already comment?
The year apple 🍏 start making iphone phones, Apple watch and Ipads that takes expandable memory card. Then i will say yea it's worth the money. Anything else is a shit. I will wait when the iphone 13pro max is $150 then i will buy one.
An important thing to remember about the night photos on the iPhone 13 is that unlike most Androids, it defaults to between 1 and 3 seconds rather than 3 to 10. In Mrwhosetheboss’s video, he originally thought they were comparable, but then showed the iphone13 photos when forcing it to take 10 second photos. When you do that, it is leagues ahead of any other phone on the market
Everything in iphone13 is good except Zoom power!!???!!
Big battery life but very big size
I think iphone 13 pro max is so good and I'm thinking to sell my s21 ultra for this
Silver colour is my favourite 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
This is a tough decision for me Galaxy 21 ultra or a Iphone 13 pro max. Galaxy has so many percs especially with the fingerprint sensor  that i use every day on my current phone and the usb c is compatible with everything i use unlike the iphone charger.
no mercy im good with s21 ultra🤣😂😅😅😅 and wait for note 22
Apple doesnt do everything first. But they make it the best on the market when they do.
9That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
Getting my 13pro tomorrow, can’t wait!
😒😒
What gear do you use to record the audio?
Great videos, Tom the Talented Tech Chap
I just pre-order the iPhone 13 pro max
Sorry to ask your this but, what's your polo's brand??
Screw the faster charging. When will apple finally add always on as a display feature?
On the 13 pro, the notch is actually thicker. So it cuts in on YouTube vids of 18:9. On the pro max it’s not an issue.
My dream  Someone phone me and gift me iphone 13pro max 🤣😂🤣🤣🤣
I‘m a lot into photography especially when it comes down to macro. Therefore, I‘m really excited about the updated camera system on the iPhone 13. What I actually saw on your phone is that the apps don‘t seem to fit the new aspect ratio of the screen. That‘s the point I sold my iPad Pro 11, since some of my fav apps never got a proper update for this side ratio. Hopefully this won‘t be an issue for the new lineup. Btw nice vid - thanks a lot!
I’m excited! I ordered the pro Thursday. It will be here in 11 days. So far away. But I got graphite 256 gb 😊
Here i am still have the iPhone XS max hahahah🤪
Quality looks cheap!!
I notice in the video that you're using Windows 11, and I'm curious what your thoughts are on it?
Noooo amigo donde te sentaste
Super quality 👍🏾👍🏾
Not another one... 😒 Can anyone recommend another YouTuber who actually cares about technology.?? There's absolutely NOTHING new in the iPhones, unless you're an iPhone user. Android have all these features for years, and no body cared about them, but suddenly they're so important now? Even android central, talks more about Apple than EverythingApplePro! 🤦🏽‍♂️It's great to hear about what's new with iPhones, but acting like it's the next best thing is just dumb! It's so frustrating when people think it's all new, when you literally just down a phone that could do it all! 🤦🏽‍♂️
My favorite things about this phone  are the macro camera and the photographic style options
This is a great video, well done. Love the fact that the whole video was taken off the actual phone to show the true video quality.
You forget one thing about low light photography. The iPhone 13 seems the same as iPhone 12 but shutterspeed is much shorter on 13. For example,  the 12 needs 3s for a shot while the 13 does it in 1s. If you manual choose 3s on both phones you will see the difference
Guys..is there way (app) to organize iphone photos just like Samsung..I mean to move and paste photos in the gallery and not only copy and paste.
Tbh idk what to choose…. I have 11 pro max and its perfect for me i loveee that big screen the big battery and the Weight but…. I think 240g and 6.7 will be too much for me… what do you think?
That's great a review. But in the same way I'm not sure if I still wanna upgrade from my 12 Pro Max to the 13 Pro Max. All I care about is the latest and best (main) camera. I'm not sure if the 2.2x "better optics" are really that much better in real life.
I bought the 1 terabyte blue sierra 13 pro max, it's spectacular.
your videos are so enjoying to watch. thx for the great review <3
Fabulous video. Thank you. I have iPhone 12 Pro Max  Love the phone. Can’t change yet!
Should i upgrade from my s21 ultra to the iphone 13 pro max?
11 pro Max still holds
Switching from a Pixel 5 to an iPhone 13 Pro
The make or break for me is the multitasking capability of the android. You could open it side by side. The customization of the android is superb.
Fantastic video The Tech Chap. Great test. Now im thinking anout to switch from my 12 pro to 13 pro. This Blue 💥❤️
What shooting game was that you were playing lol
The fringing around yourself is extremely noticeable and distracting. It's not in all shots though, so just don't use whatever mode was causing that.
Loved your review! I actually have 11 Pro Max. When you get the money for it : best thing to do for testing is to take it for the kinda “two weeks trial” which I’m doing right now. I took the 13 pro as the max are getting really bulky these days. Not a giant leap IMO, but many small improvements would say. Macro is really amazing, everything is smouth (120) speaker is better l, rear flashlight is brighter, speaker is louder and clearer, photo is crispier, GOS accuracy is similar, but for everyday use the 11 pro was really satisfying. So not sure if the huge cost is worth the change to be honest. I mean it’s better in so many ways but the price tag is Max too :)
Him waving the phone around without a case gives me anxiety.
You just PERFECTLY explained every reason why this is the 1st iPhone since 4S to convince me to move to iPhone as my primary phone. Apple has finally perfected the hardware, except for USB C and fingerprint. But hopefully next year!   Now they just need to bring more software features. For example not having a number row or haptic feed back on a keyboard is ridiculous.
We\ring a mask is resolved by having a Apple watch 😉
Great video. Subscribed 🤝
Is the weight any issue for anyone? I’m finding 13 pro max but heavy and having doubt.
I’m switching from a 12 mini to a 13promax… can’t wait !
For me, the filming is amazing!!!!!!
what is the name of the first game he played? with the Jets
The Cinematic mode is a nice 1st gen attempt but far from actually being usable.
Which town did you film this in, i loved the cobble streets
2:14 what game is that ?
Always wanted a small nd powerful phone so it's the pro for me
Whoa Thom with the bold declaration! “The best phone you can buy.” You are going to get some angry comments, mate. But I agree, I’m loving my 13 Pro Max. Yesterday I got a whopping 12 HOURS (11 hours 42 minutes to be exact) of screen on time and still had 24% battery left at bed time. That is simply INCREDIBLE.
Comparing the iPhone to Samsung or android will always be subjective but I fully agree that yes the 13 is the best phone on the market right now. The video was great and mostly people would not of know you suit it on the iPhone. Great work sir
🙄my 12 is now vibrating randomly without showing notifications, I swear if my phone glitches more and more idgaf I’m getting the 13…🤷🏾‍♂️
love your eyes,so charming
Where was this filmed? The entire vlog is amazing and the location is so nice too!
Omg the end of video told us that the entire of the video recorded by the iphone 13… the quality was so impressive good job 👍😍 U guys can see the reflection : 7:45
Would you like exchange your iphone 13 pro max for two sheep on my farm?
I've been loving my 13 Pro so far! I can even get two full days, 48 hours of use out of it, with about 8 hours of screen on time!
Future proofing with a lightning connector 🙃
Can you share your wallpaper ?
You got right click menu possibly at the wrong place..
They have a long way to go for cinematic mode.
Great video. Thanks
Oh shit you broke your iPhone. It release this month man.😶
I originally got the iPhone 13 Pro Max after switching from Samsung Galaxy S9. I am now in the process of exchanging it for the iPhone 13 Pro despite the really awesome battery life on the Max because it is unwieldy...and I'm a guy with pretty large hands.
Just watched arun' video and i knew you gonna tag him here👊...that 13 pro max battery life is excellent🔥
Who cand gift me an iphone 13 pro pls 😊
Cinematic mode looks very weird on a big screen
Great review. Hope to put out great content like yours in my channel
When you dropped the iPhone on the iPad, did the iPad survive? I love my new iPhone 13 Pro Max! The camera and battery life are great! Coming from an iPhone 11 Pro. Agreed on lack of multitasking. Thank you for the great review demonstrating what upgrades actually exist/don't exist for the iPhone Pro.
Great battery but the really  slow charging and locked in iOS  makes it a no from me. Just ordered my daughter the blue pro max. Price is typically too high but expected.  Waiting on the s22
i switched from samsung to iphone, i did ordered the iphone 13 pro max, normally it will be delivered around the 11 of october!
Fabulous review
Iphone 13mini vs 13pro max galaxy 23 .HELP
iPhones are garbage. Typing on my Z Fold2 5G.
Cinematic mode is impressive
Good one. 👍👍
If you didn’t say nothing bout this whole video being filmed on the iPhone I would’ve thought it was just one of those fancy cameras lol Apple nailed it 🔥
The 13 pro max can charge at 27w.
Any phone review should be shot on the phone reviewed. 👍👍
Aroon? I always thought it was pronounced “Arunn”
I like it  13 pto max good fone
Great vlog as always Tom. Fair and honest 👏👏 I’m also swapping my s21 Ultra for the 13 Pro. Will miss the zoom for sure but enjoy the eco system with Apple 🍏 However keeping an eye out for the Pixel 6 📱😉
video quality horribly off-putting. Said it a million times before, a phone will not beat a camera at being a camera
Jesus on a motorbike!! The video looked MEGA! Question is will filmic pro and Protake be providing cinematic mode so I can have more creative control ?
I feel Cinematic Mode will be very popular in social media and pretty much any situation where you need a blurred background. I really like it and don't mind it's not 4K.  I've never even recorded 4K because they take up too much storage and are difficult to share anyway.
The intro shots looked so good that I thought it’s shot with a big camera. Love the video!
Top notch!
,,I switched my SIM card to the iPhone. I've gone to the dark side"😂😂😂 Not really. You ran away from the dark side and went to the light side to be clear.
and here in Saudi Arabia there’s no stock in any major store in any color, any memory in 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max, ridiculous!
Ordered the pro max 13 upgrading from a Xs…. Hopefully I don’t regret it and it lasts me at least 3-4 years 😅
The video quality is absolutely insane. Great video and review. I have enjoyed a lot. Hard to believe that someday we would be able to record this with a phone!!!. Just an amazing review!
I was looking for a video which could show me the cinematic mode capabilities. Planning to buy iPhone 13 Pro after watching your video. Thanks. 👍🏼
I am using xs still now. I was thinking about buying the 13 PM. as it will give the best battery life. But, My hand is slightly smaller. after watching your video, I am gonna go with 13 P. Thanks to you.
Just want to correct something you said. The 128GB models of the 13 Pros will have ProRes recording, but it will be limited to 1080P 30 fps. If you have a 256 GB or higher 13 Pro, you will get ProRes recording up to 4K 30 fps. 👍
Fantastic Review however lets wait for the king # Pixel
which two games did he play in this video please name it someone
yeah after shooting a cinematic video you can undo it and remove the blur buttttttt it'll be shot on 1080p which you can't make 4k afterwards. apple it is!!!! releasing features bit by bit otherwise who'll buy the same looking iPhone for 3 years and may be more
iphone13 Pm applied Donald Trump filter 😊
wow, even i don't like to use apple, apple actually the first one implement the multiple colour profile that i expect for android phone, i expect google would implement AI training for camera on every phone, made the phone more custom tweak to each individual instead of all people getting the same result. now the AI in android phone is a joke.
Feels like it's time for a switch from samsung 😼
Does the UK phone have the new Millimeter band wave antennas for the faster bands of 5G?
Do you think apple will give 12Pro max the Cinematic video mode?
Low-light videos are pretty much unusable, thanks to the lens flares.
Nice take caring of iPhone 12 pro max,,,😁😁🤣🤣
Well the lacks of fps, poor focusing and overall poor quality made me think "this isn't shot on his regular camera, right?". It kinda shows phones haven't been able to catch upto professional cameras yet. Kinda makes the oscar director shooting that movie narrative of Apple total bs, isn't it?
i have a dream too iphone don't know when it will end
The video quality is really great. If you’d never mentioned it in the end I would’ve forgotten that the video is really shot with iPhone 13 Pro. A job well done - to you because of the content and to Apple for making such a great piece of tech for you to use. 👍🏻👏
Man I gotta say I forgot I was watching a video filmed by an iPhone lol
Where are you filming? Beautiful town!
Would it be worth upgrading from the iPhone 11 to the 13 pro max ?
Video quality is 💯
I can’t belive that this entire video has been shot by a phone, thats crazy 🤯
give me your broken 12 pro max 😭😭
The vogue effect is terrible in this video
Yes I still deciding about pro or pro max and at the end of this video is really help haha I would trust you and go for the pro even the pro max also tempting…. My current phone is XS Max … hopefully won’t regret after switch to the smaller size
iphone 13 pm😂😂 S20 ultra am
Great review, like you said the few negatives are the charging speed, still using a proprietary lightning cable when iPad are USB C. On a personal level I have a family WhatsApp group chat I don't want to lose, I really like the iPhone 13 Pro Max though!
I have an annual upgrade program for the iphone. coming from a 12 pro to the 13 pro max. battery was dead after a full day of use for me on the 12 pro. up at 8, bed around midnight, and it was always under 10%. Yesterday morning, at 8, i unplugged my 13 pro max at full charge. It's nearly noon today, haven't charged it since then, and i'm at 46%. the battery on this phone is incredible. i don't even know how i'd kill it in a day.
It’s amazing what these smart phones are capable of nowadays…..good job subscribed like button smashed 👊
I won't buy this one but I like that Apple have listened at least this time. I'll see what happens next year.
It's all well and good having a longer lasting battery, but what's the point with the so so slow charging method. Give us USBC and fast charging?
I wonder if they will ever upgrade the 12MP camera
it does look like it was recorded with a phone, hopefully pixel 6 will fix that
Why do all the reviewers KEEP getting the pro res video wrong, it’s very annoying. You CAN shoot pro res videos on 128gb model but only at 1080p
Excellent Review 👍 👍
Good Old Wells, my Alma mater
I’m moving from the 12 Pro Max to the 13 Pro. I’ve always gone for larger phones but found the 12 Pro Max too heavy for extended use, and the 13 Pro Max is heavier again!
Fanboy damn
Those cameras look soo big
13 Pro Max on order. Switching from a Google Pixel 4 XL. I've been with Android since the beginning and iOS lagged way behind for a very long time but iOS is now at a point where I can have the functionality and customisability that I want - as well as widgets, that I can make the switch.
This is the  best phone I've owned hands down
Im an android user but I have to say that cinematic video feature on the iphone looks awesome
Hats off to Apple.  Really like the 13 Pro/Max versions.  Cinematic mode has a long way to go though.  It looks pretty cack even with the effect on fairly low levels.  It doesn't trace around tricky objects well and you get weird blurring/haloing effects.  Not a bad first effort.  Can't help but feel the new Pixel will blow this out of the water.  I have an iPhone 13 Pro and also a Fold 3.  I would never get a non-fold Galaxy phone in the UK due to the Exynos rubbish that Samsung pulls here every year
It gets a 9.25/10  guys wait for the 14 pro. That's a solid 10/10  1. Tiny punch hole display  2. Built in finger print sensor  3. True 2 day battery life (12hr sot on dark) 4. Perfect camera all around (from what you can expect from a tiny sensor )
Battery endurance/cameras/performance are insane!
Imagine how much battery would you gain more on 60hz
Hahaha everybody us getting crazy with 13  me just chilling and watching on my iphone se first gen running ios 15
I like iphone
I use a pixel 5a and the 13 pro. Samsung has totally lost all its appeal with me and the only android I’d ever use is the pixel. The 13 pro (non max) so far is so freaking good , battery life and cameras are 2nd to none
I could tell immediately, it's really crappy Jux like Samsung's portrait video
Great video, but still believe the Pixel 6 Pro will be the best phone of 2021 and 2022 until Google release the Pixel 7 Pro
After using samsung phone for the past 11 years , finally an iphone that i am looking forward to (ProMotion). Oh and also no more inferior exyanos chip from samsung.
I got my 13 pro Sierra Blue yesterday. Really good👍
For those who are from the Philippines, goodluck $2,000 🤮🤮 is real.
Not durable.
you should do your s22 review the same way so we can compare video performance!
I'm jeeping my 12 Pro Max and waiting for the 14 series.
Where was this shot. Beautiful location
Same phone 😂😂😂
Did you experience the iphone 13 pro max forcibly reducing screen's brightnesss after gaming for a while ???
My iphone 7 is getting old now. I think I have to upgrade in the next few months. Thanks for the review. I'm loving the macro on this, though I use the moment macro which I think gives far better results.
Before you said it was recorded on the iPhone, I was thinking, "That looks HORRIBLE!" The bokeh effect is terrible. Your hair is all smudged. It just looks awful. So far it's the best advertisement for NOT getting the phone.
@thetech love from India ❤, lovely vlog... keep it up... best wishes..
I don’t like cinematic mode at all! a lot of buried parts ,hair, hands borders etc
Welcome to the light side
I'm a Samsung fan but I can't deny that Apple did a very good job with these improvements, especially with battery life. I hope that Samsung will work on this too for the S22 lineup
This video is refreshing Tom
Brilliant video. Really very well done. This guy is down-to-earth and his comments are always spot-on. No ridiculous posing or loving himself like Mr Boss, and no bullshit. Bravo. 10 out of 10.
Great job ! How does the battery compares with the asus ROG 5 ultimate?
Great to see phones having great battery life, unfortunately it's also getting to carrying around a brick in your pocket. As for the cinematic mode, the bokeh transitions look really bad and I'd never use it but I can see this being improved a lot in the future
Is this place Cambridge? :)
Youtubers are just now nit picking on flagship phones..
I have an iPhone 11 and I’m just thinking if it’s a good idea upgrade to an iPhone 13 pro max 🤔
Considering it's on a phone, not bad, but definitely not as good as your standard production videos. I hated the blur effect though. Personally I probably wouldn't ever use it.
Upgraded to the 13 Pro  Max from the 11Pro Max here.  I rarely find it worth trading up within a year as the upgrades are rarely leapfrog.  Just my opinion.
Exactly, Tom.  I picked up an iPhone 13 Pro this morning.  I ordered the IPhone 13 Pro Max but changed my mind at the store.  The iPhone 13 Pro feels just right.   Great, sensible review.👍🏼
Nice review, impressive camera system.
A nuanced and great review.  Thanks
I upgraded from the XS to the 13 Pro Max, it’s a nice upgrade!
Your video is going to make sakitech and his fan Bois angry LOL.
13 pro max is the best iphone launch this year best battery life ,120hz, cpu power, cinematic mode and camera everything is awesome just one disappointment is the notch.
I like people who are polite to pigeons.
Gonna be upgrading to a 13 Pro from my trusty iPhone X. Pro Max was tempting but one hand usability is more important for me
S21 to chap - it was said you would destroy ios....not join them,bring balance to the android community not leave it in darkness 😭
Video quality in Iphone 13 pro max is amazing! So clean.
Which game is he playing?
Brother give me iphone 13 pro max free....i have dream
Welcome to the dark side
“The entire video is shot on iPhone 13” Yes sir I can see it, he said it as if nobody noticed it, the fake Gaussian blur bokeh and the "halo" on his edge. It's like the product from the guy who tell you "he knows Photoshop".   I apreciate that smart phones are taking much better photoes and videos now, they come a long way, but so as real cameras. Any marketing that suggests a smart phone can replace even an APS-C camera should be considered fake ad. "Cinematic mode", what an awkard attempt by Apple. Dear Apple, don't play with technology that's not ready and don't try to compete with somthing that's far beyond your level.
iPhone 13 pro for me😌👌🏼
I am just waiting for my iPhone 13 Pro Max to come in the mail. Leaving my Samsung Note 10+5G....let's see how this goes...
Please gift me an iPhone 13pro...
Noticeable improvement over my iphone 11 pro, especially cameras and 120 hz screen.
what’s That game at 2:13???
I still don’t like the notch & the lack of customisation & the slower charging still there. I much prefer to stick with my S21 ultra & my Samsung Z flip 3, I’m not saying the new iPhone is bad oh no is a great phone, but it’s just isn’t my cup of tea, anyway great video thanks & peace ✌️
Lens flares?
Give me one iphon Mobil pleas I am wait your replay
Excellent. This helps my decision and it’s the 13 Pro Max for me. I see the camera phone race becoming very competitive which is great for us consumers. The selfie camera needs improved in a few ways as well as cinematic being in 4K but for now, it’s like changing shoes one every a year looking for a better fit! Thanks again!
Arun ❌ Aroon ✅
Man stop it iPhone on top all the way with just 12 megapixel while others brands trying to compete with ridiculous 1000 megapixel 😂🤣😂
The cinema mode looks like shit the blur around the hair and ears is so artificially annoying
Very boring phone, you could have re-uploaded the review of the 12 and say it's the 13, apple fans wouldn't notice
Watch this video after looking cost of the phone  and MI 11TPRO 🤣🤡
512gb iPhone 13 Pro Max in sierra blue 💙💙💙
I noticed you say "what do you reckon" a lot in every video
The quality of the video is really good! So happy with mine too.
Plz bro Redmi note 10pro vs Infinix zero x pro camera comparison plz plz plz bro
I still have an iPhone XR and the quality of this videos AMAZES me.  I have no complaint about mine cause I'm just now starting to get familiar with video-making and I don't use my phone much aside from normal communication. But this 13 Pro is just WOW in terms of quality filming, especially if you're just someone that hasn't yet dived deep into video editing and filming. Some tech people underplay the camera upgrade too much. Us regulars would love this =)
OnePlus 9 pro vs iphone 13 Pro camera test soon.?????
Great review. Beautiful location. Where was this shot? :)
An S21 Ultra vs 13 Pro Max Camera comparison from your end will be interesting Tom.
5:40 **Laughs In Huawei P10 Lite From 4+ Years*... *Laughs in Pain**
Best Vedio...
Is that Wells? I swear I recognise that street aha
The video quality is quite good.  But your content is quite better.
On behalf of all the chaps, I would like to congratulate Tom for transitioning  😂
Damn I had an iPhone 11 Pro and upgraded to the 12 pro max last year and I knew I should’ve waited.. this iPhone is so awesome just because of small improvements like the refresh. Hopefully I can keep my wallet in my ass and wait for the 14 LOL!
Those photos all look the same to me.
you are too handsome 🤤
Finally upgraded from my s8+ too the new flip 3 no regrets about not getting an iPhone 13
Video quality is excellent
“I didn’t think a feature Apple released on their phone would be any good.” 😂 that’s why they take so long to bring features
13:09 - Only a massive crack in a 12 pro max will tell you the difference between it and the 13 pro max 🤣  Kudos on the video! great work and welcome to the dark side 😄!
Don't worry you gonna come back to s22 ultra
The cinematic blur looks bad. It feels like a green screen behind you instead of a natural blur that happens due to focal lenth. they need to work on making the blur gradual and more natural.
Just ordered my 13promax .This will be my first iPhone. Current phone is note 20ultra
Can i know those games from this video??
Honest question, if the battery life is unbelievable then what difference does the fast charging make? I charge my phone over night. If it lasts all day do I care how fast or slow it charges over night?
Techchamp...was that Ed in the background?👀
The biggest upgrade is the real world battery life.
Only one word this phone doesn't deserve to give 14 minute of your life
probably the 13 pro
I can't believe the whole video was captured by the iphone. They've nailed it
Loving the ProMotion display on my 13 Pro - everything is so smooth
if samsung doeznt do something about battery & cheap & camera wz S22 Apple gonna invade ze world
Balimbing
There is so much more you can do with your android devices, iPhones are nice..but… lightning? nah to me it’s just like another iPhone X the  notch is horrible by the way you get way more out of an android phone unless you are looking for “pro-res” it’ll take you more time to transfer those files with usb 2.0 speeds than to edit them. Android is way more polished and feature packed than ever. I got rid of my XS max because of all the nightmares you get with lightning.
Be good if you reviewed some alternative phones, like ones that are environmentally friendly. The massive amount of natural resources and energy that go into making Apple, Samsung, Huawei etc. products is crazy, and they give very little back.  I respect your channel, it's informative, but leading people to have the next newest shiny bit of tech isn't great for the future of our planet.  Be great if you could look at some of the other alternatives that aren't ruining the future for our children or everything else that lives here 👍
How much paid for this promotion video
I hate the color temperature shifting, so annoying.
Nice 1 week iPhone review
Wait for s22 ultra. That will be game changer fyi commenting from 12 pro max😅 hangs and lags
Great looking video, very impressive. I am intrigued as to how did you the walking shot with the coffee in one and and the phone in the other at 5:48. Was the phone stuck to your forehead?
Cinematic mode looks great for your talking head. Great job!
The 13 Pro Max isn't big enough. Anyone over 6' can benefit from a bigger max.
What game is that he was playing on the crazy battery segment?
The cinematic mode really delivers good quality but it can also be much enhanced on further software updates but iPhone 13 Pro Max aside, you look so good on there Tom. So handsome indeed. 😁😊
thank you for saying the clickbait thing at the beginning
Can't use iPhone they are just boring and look same as they have done for years
I wish reviewers would do videos acknowledging the damage that Apple has done to the smartphone world. The trends they've started that in reality is only about making money. I love smartphones and it used to be a thing I loved to follow and watch what companies new innovations have come out with. Now it's just Apple taking away features and the other companies following what Apple gets away with. Now that LG is gone there won't be anymore SD card slots on flagships and hifi DACs and all the crazy and sometimes ingenious innovation they had. This has become a very boring and sad part of what I used to love about smartphones. IMO Apple is responsible for being the biggest killer of innovation in this thing I used to love. iPhones are a one trick pony with cameras and that's it. There's no real innovation nothing new or exciting. Watch any iPhone video and the first half is the reviewer talking about the colours. That's it?...
S21 ultra the king of 2021
Best video You have ever made !  (Tim cook)
Give me iPhone sir :(🙏🏻
Despite the "Pro" moniker, I still don't consider it a Pro device. It's not USB-C, which has comparability through a wide selection of hardware, something Apple promoted on their iPad Minnie. It also is a big polava to transfer files to/from the device, that's not Apple. I should just be able to plug my device into my PC, and transfer files, with ease. I shouldn't need to download more software for this basic feature. I understand it's just good security, but it gets in the way of basic functionality. Lastly, CSAM is a big issue. Scanning images, no... scanning files, on a "Pro" device is a huge no no. I've had documents, and media that were confidential, and if they got leaked (even a thumbnail), I could get into a lot of trouble.
I have you a silly question.  I need to buy an iPhone for my mother which she will definitely keep for the next 5-6 years. Do I go for iPhone 13 or for the Pro. Will the higher FPS matter for her ? 😁
Thinking of going up to the 13 Pro/Pro Max from my current 12 Pro, really want that better camera, bigger battery and 120Hz
Can I have your iPhone Xs Max,?
Given all the rumours floating around regarding replacing the screen/ battery I would definitely avoid this iPhone/ future iPhones if all the rumours come out as true.
I'll consider switching to iPhone when 5G is widely available where I live
Awesome!
didn't read the title...heard "the entire video was shot on iphone" = mindblown
Amazing quality. All while watching I had to remind myself that some shots were on the phone.
Techy guy having gf ⊙.☉
I have my iPhone 13 Pro Max and I love it!!!! It’s just software updates to be out soon that I can’t wait for.
Mannnn...the video quality is amazing..if you hadn't mentioned it was shot on the phone..I honestly wouldn't recognise                (P.S- I'm not a pixel peeper so it does look pretty good to me)
I did figured that this was shot on the iPhone   But damm that is good Cinematic mode is good , it needs a bit more work but its good i can't wait to see where would it get in 2-3years    The footage from the iPhone is a bit Red'ish i am not a fan of that
Quality of the video is excellent
Miss my pixel camera so rich contrast is gonna be staying on
this my favorite iPhone 13 (whatever modell) review of all! well made, informative - makes want to have one!
Wow top video, the little nugget of info re the fact the screen gets DARKER is so important to me and is something I don't think anyone else has or will mention. At night will make a huge difference!
Great to see you making the switch back to the iPhone. The 13 Pro Max is beast of a phone 👌
Very good & honest review!
Finally 120hz on a iPhone 😀
Good video. However, I got the 13 Pro Max. I really like the size. You really don’t think about how big the phone is after about 30 seconds of using it. I am really quite happy with it.
Where is your battery drain test video bro  When you do it pls include the 12 & 13 Mini in it
Video quality is great, really impressed . IPhone isn't for me but  a lot to like here with the 13. That notch though. Yikes. Stay safe.
Doesn't look great.
Loving that Sierra blue colour...
The battery life is the most exciting thing for me! More flagships need a battery this good.
didn't even realize it was shot an iPhone thts some good quality.  Coming from a Samsung user aswell
I never ever heard any one breaking their iPhone by dropping an iPad on it    You would probably be the first guy to ever do that
Man these phones shoot great video. I would've never thought it was shot on an phone.
Absolutely amazing battery life on the iPhone 13 Pro Max 👍
11:39 congrats on your transition! ⚧
Gone to the Dark side 🤣
Great choice mate! I think using an iPhone for creating content has never been easier, and the results are insane. I might have to try it out 😅  The 120Hz, ProRes (when we get it), Cinematic mode, better cameras and battery are worth the upgrade personally.
Early birds attendance check! 🤪👋🏼
That bokeh looks horrendous.
Cinematic mode can't do HDR?
Thunderbolt, real telly cam still missing, so there are some points why i don't want to get one, but great video as ususal
Wow what a way to get a crack on your phone, Drop an iPad onto your iPhone😂. Btw the video quality is actually looking pretty good if I say so myself  And considering the high refresh display and the battery tests, the battery is insane
Nice video! Thank you so much! But cinematic looks like beta Software, perhaps next year it will be better
That new cinema mode is insane. It's just a shame that it only records 1080p.
That’s cinematic mode is on fire!
Your channel is very great 👍👌👏😀
Wow
Sony XPERIA 1 III is better than iPhone 13 Pro max
Over priced phone....check. Not interested.
We always apperiate your honest reviews. Your a champ!
like your video very much
God that bokeh effect is awful that's shot on the iPhone...
Was waiting for your review
Well that drop shows how fragile the back glass really is! 😹😹
i saw someone did Iphone 13 Pro Max camera test vs XiaoMi Mi 11 Ultra, and XiaoMi MI Ultra destroys Iphone 13 Pro Max, what a let down from apple
Good iPhone camera
Hey Chaps! What did you make of the iPhone's footage for filming this video? Reckon I should chuck my A7Siii in the bin? 😅  Update 1: ProRes is coming to all Pros, but only 1080p for 128gb models  Update 2: happy to hear Apple will soon add a lens lock feature so camera doesn’t keep switching between wide/UW
Was waiting for your review
👍🏻
