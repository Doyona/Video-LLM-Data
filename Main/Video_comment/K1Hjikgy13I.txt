Purple 💜 and orange 🧡 lights would be absolutely amazing!
watching this in June  2025 xD
we need a vlog-o-ween this year🎃
Dang that lemon 🍋 dessert looks so good
Genuinely I can't tell you how many times a year I rewatch all your vlogs in order because they truly fill me with joy. Getting to watch you and Shane enjoy the little (and big!) things in life together is so heartwarming, it's such an escape from school haha💖
These are my favorite types of videos where they go shopping and decorate their house
Do orange lights for Holloween.
"Poulette" means Female Chicken in French lol
I could watch you guys reviewing food all day but I’m curious to find what Shane likes
OMFG I LOVE COLLEEN HOOVER. Ive read the book Hopeless and omg it made me fucking bawl. And then the Slammed book 1 and i need the read the second one.
Yeah, there is a rattlesnake in there, Ryland 🙄😒
Vlogween come on even tho this was last year
Y’all can hate me for this but imo. Nightmare before Christmas is most definitely a Halloween movie
Loved the video but did anyone else have to skip the taste test because of the noise 😂
The nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween thru Christmas movie. It's versatile.. that's the point 😆
Shyland black hole took me outttt 😂😂
Vloggoween!!!
Mesophonia. Please 🙏  no more biting or chewing sounds. Horribly triggered. I cannot be the only one.
Mmmm i think its a take on banoffee pie the caramel one 1st up yummy great bakery ❤
Poulet is chicken in french guy's ❤
I have to say you are so h8gh vibes and happy in Colorado shane❤ love you're decorations 🎉its fall yall 😂
Hear me out... "Vlog-o-ween"?
i love shane
A bissant!!!! Lol
I love how Shane cheers Ryland on and it’s total bs and I love it 😂  you both work very hard and helping each other succeed in life in every way  ( beautiful homes  and animals and babies  your bantor and always willing to find solutions to make you both happy I love it ) and I love how domesticated  Ryland is and works hard at both jobs yes running and keeping a home is work ) Shane is constantly editing and working in other areas too and being so creative? You both do alot  but I gotta say Shane in Colorado soooooo happy is amazing and I love you guys together ❤❤❤❤ it’s 2024 and I’m rewatching again lol😂
Wait, can you guys sell ur alpaca yarn so I can crochet w it!?
jack is still my aesthetic, pop out with the full fit with my key chain lanyard blanket mug a plushy and slippers
Macaroon and macaron are two different pastries😂 its not the wrong way to say it, theyre just two totally different items. A macaron= what ryland is eating, a macaroon is a coconut blob😂
I'm not going to lie. I love you Shane but you did act like a lazy pregnant diva in this vlog and I am living for it.
Whens garret and morgan gonna meet the babies???
wait why is that macaron so big
Ryland you need to learn how to knit or crochet and use the alpaca fur made into yarn! Make baby hats and mittens for Jet and Max! (If not allergic)❤
SHANE i have that same wrangler jacket lol so comfy
3:17 Shane is giving Halston vibes, just saying
I’d love to see more of Ryland with the fur of the alpacas making beanies or other things, it be cool to see him do some old fashion work
Vlog-a-ween next year 🎉🎉
Macarough is the closest it gets for English speakers to being right with the French pronunciation
missed you more then I can even begin to say, cancel culture has gotten toxic and people are straight up LOUD AND WRONG, they hear something and take it ten notches to far, your fucking killing it, keep killing it. 💗
I love Shane's blue Native American print jacket. Where can I get one? Lol For real tho.
You guys just make me so dang happy 😊   I swear you cure my depression 🥰
How is nobody talking about Shane going "do you call it  macaRONI and cheese, no, you call it maca....macaroonie and cheese??..wait... " 😂😂😂😂😂
No ..I was encouraging 😂😂, you 2 are 2 adorable 😊
Shane needs a hair cut and shave so bad. He should start like bathing and taking care of himswlf before the babies are born
Vlogaween
28:27 died!
Let me just say I have been so depressed the last couple of days and I just have been binge watching all y’all’s videos and it is so comforting to me so thank y’all for making me have a little light in my dark days ❤❤❤
Is Rylond giving baby birth?!??
It’s funny how ryland is the fem in the relationship but he’s the one always doing the manly work 😂❤️
I’m so excited to see you guys be parents!!!
Come to San Antonio and stay at the Pearl.There is a bakery across the street that will forever ruin any other bakery experience
Does anyone know what ever happened to their dog Honey?
Please be ready for December the 1st! I had my baby 2 weeks before my due date and everyone I know has had their babies 2 weeks before
i don’t even know if y’all are gonna see this but this girl i follow on tiktok, she showed her twin babies until they were old enough to be able to be known in public or whatever i hope that makes sense, i think maybe like 3 y/o?
aawweeee!!! dec15!!thats my dad who passed aways birthday
Wow 600k viewers, absolutely astounding 🥱
Love you guys
DID U SAY …TWO….BABIES …????? Omgoshhhh 😯 W0W    U guys are gunna stay real busy for a while ❤️CONGRATULATIONS!!!  Very happy for y’all ❤️
Just edit little emojis on their faces. So their face is hidden but they are in the video.
We need to have a talk about how incredibly disappointed i am in yall and the lack of Nightmare Before Christmas knowledge you have. Also ITS NOT A CHRISTMAS MOVIE!
A macaroon is a coconut cake/cookie usually half dipped in chocolate and a macaron is what you guys were eating.
Poulet is the translation for chicken in French
the scare crow moved it’s hand ever so slightly
Shane I want you're shirt!
I love Poulette!!! I followed them when they were advertising on NextDoor and baking out of their house to them opening up their bake shop. It's so exciting to see you guys trying them out and supporting them 😁
I love you guys so much ❤
I love all their videos together 🥰 when they were in the telsa ryland explaining what pastry he wanted and Shane “Doesn’t sound very fall…” 😂😂 I love all their season energy 😍
You guys, you better get all your Vlogmas done well before those babies come, because if you think you’re going to be spitting out videos or Podcasts, or anything of that nature, once you have twin newborns, you’re not, that’s a promise
It should be called Vlogspook instead of Halloween Vlogmas
You should try to find Lewis
Shane you should help Ryland put up the decorations just saying! You are so spoiled!
have you tried to lemon bars at trader joes? i just go there when I'm craving lemon bars lol/ they also have other good desserts, and sandwiches!
This was such a fun video. Patiently waiting for more 😊
Shane is practicing being a dad to the MAX
Let's have dadmas🎉 the run up and then small glimpse into life even the sleep part as not many dads show their experience ❤❤
I love the visual of Ryland doing ALL of the work and decorating 😂😂😂 I always heard him complain about it jokingly but now that I see it it all makes sense 🤦🏻‍♀️😂😂 Shane is just there for the vibe
Poulet (Chicken) French for chicken ahah. Its a chicken bakehouse ! <3
Im just curious whats going to happen with the podcast on shanes second channel once the babies come?
I love seeing Shane happy. Cuz I remember whenever he was very very depressed before even Liz bug. Ryland you do complete him. You were the missing piece to that puzzle. But at the end of the day you're made for each other, you can tell you are the other half of Shane's heart❤.
Your dog was eating grass when they have a tummy ache.  All dogs do it when they're gut don't feel good. Normal to do just keep eye one him love you guys❤
If they were out of the skeletons , and they wasn't getting any more. They could have sold you the display.
The ghost dog you got actually went viral on TT i guess so good taste lol
How did I just subscribe and started watching. I love both of you! BINGING!
@Rylandsvlog "Macaroon" =👄 •Mack-uh-roon  (Mack like smack.) •(Uh- like pack a lunch.)  •(Roon like moon.)  •Now say the whole word fast!= Mack-uh-roon 😂
Good luck sleeping until noon when you have twins
I love how shane keeps talking about how he hasn't pooped first thing. Same sister.
I totally respect and understand not wanted to show the babies and not exploiting them. I think it’s great but the selfish part of me hopes we at least get to see a picture here and there as they grow! I’m so excited for you guys! They will be here before you know it! I say play your blog as by ear and just pick up a camera when you have time or only do half the month. You guys are gonna have your hands full once the babies are here. I just wouldn’t set big expectations on yourself because even with just one newborn it’s almost setting yourself up for failure if you take on too much the first couple months of being new parents. That’s just my thoughts as a Mom of 4 for what it’s worth anyway  😉 just be careful what you commit to and take on until you guys find your way into being new parents with newborns. I know anyone who’s a parent will totally understand and i’m willing to bet even people who aren’t parents yet will too. 😃
How about nightmare before christmas? Best of BOTH worlds
You should have gotten 2 boxes of orange lights and two of the purple and twist a set of purple and orange together and put in on one side of your porch and do the same for the other side
Should probably research Colleen a little more
Awe congratulations on the twins. I'm so excited for y'all 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love you guys!❤❤❤
When they are in Colorado it makes me really happy ❤
Omg, I have a matching Ghost Boo Banner Pillow I got from Kohls! 👻
A few years ago I dreamt Shane was at my wedding with a baby. This year my wedding is December 15th and that’s their due date??? 🤯🤯🤯
Vlogoween!
I no longer know how to say Macaroon
Poulet. Chicken in French. Pronounced poo lay. You're welcome.
theres a giant pumkin wt home depo and it fits the body of the skeleton perfectly!!! please try this out i promise it wont disappoint
I love all your decorations. Everything is so cozy ❤
Shane is a vibe 😂
Nightmare before christmas is sooo overrated 😂 i dont like the movie at all LOOLL
I think its FINE showing normal smiley photos of your boys! I don't think it's fine exploiting all their development and social life. I can't imagine how hard it is to have social media as a job and feel like you can't share your pride and joy🥺🫶 sending hugs!
Are the babies here?!
If i was an alpaca this is where I would want to live. Also ship some of that alpaca wool to me in uk 😂. So excited for all that is coming up. Much love to you both x
That SKY!!! ☁️💙🤍💙☁️ ….. when your sitting in the car…..
I don't know what anyone else's thoughts are on this, but mine is that Shane has been looking so happy and hot lately. That first outfit he had on to go get the food looked amazing with his eyes. Love y'all so much ❤❤❤
Shane genuine smile and facial expression while at home depot are so adorable. This is totally me during Halloween
It is macaron because a macaroon is a different pastery. Like the whole caramel carmel thing. One is sweet yummy stuff. The other a mountain range. I want sweet stuff in my coffee. Not dirt.
December 16th is an amazing day to have a baby....my husband's birthday is the 16th
MacaRON, macaROON has coconut and flour and sweetened condensed milk, 2 diff cookies
A VLOGWEEN
Rylands hair is so gorgeous 😭😭😭🫶🏽
He got his lick
Us, french watching your review of the pâtisserie is everything 😄😋🫶🏼
Oh Shane, Nightmare Before Christmas is BOTH a Halloween movie AND a Christmas movie.
No Christmas decorations until after Halloween! But November 1st could be acceptable under the circumstances.
SHANE 😮 our due dates are the same time and that blows my mind. I used to be 13 years old watching your videos and feeling less alone and now I’m 28 doing the same thing. 🥲 we growing up together.
I can understand not showing the babies buuuuut I really Wana see them 😢 they are going to be soooooo cute!!!!!!!
I can understand not showing the babies buuuuut I really Wana see them 😢 they are going to be soooooo cute!!!!!!!
Pewdiepie said, "I was going to keep him off camera but he's just so stinking cute!"  New parent problems lol. I honestly hope we get to at least see your baybays once lol. That is enough for me lol.
👍
Name the scarecrow Bernard
Amzing
I just want to say that Ryland is looking more handsome than usual! I think it’s the longer hair and the beard lol
Macaroonie and cheese 😂😂 idk why that had me laughing so hard.
Why not have the surrogate give birth in Colorado?
Macron and Macaroon are 2 different cookies
24:31 The Nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween movie.
I Love the Taurus and Cancer energy😂💕
Omggg a VLOGOWEEN 🧡🖤
Not trying to crush dreams but it’s unlikely you will have the energy to decorate for Christmas w 2 newborns. Just saying…am i right?
I think it's more of a nibbler
Riley, louis, and... cheeto. 😂
😂 shane- do u call it macaroni and cheese or- wait a min 😂😂😂
Tjmax huh 😂
You guys should really try house of bread on S Parker road. They have some really good stuff but the best is the potato perashki’s! 😊
Very beautiful  place I
Loving Ryland’s hair!
Ryland’s doing all the labor work and Shane is being the girly girl. It’s like your roles reversed compared to the podcast lol
Vlogaween!!!!
I’m extremely confused. I thought the bakery was closed ??   Wtf   No explanation??
They have the big skeletons at Walmart
2:30 🎶Fights with Shane and Ryland 🎶
Shane and Ryland y’all look fabulous!!! Y’all are both glowing! Shane it’s giving body!!! And both y’all are giving hair!!!
5:57 Ryland if your macaron is too crispy on the outside it isn’t fresh. That’s their form of being stale 😂 you need the fresh macarons.
Nice
It's fall yall
Shane was oogie boogie shookie
all the crunching and munching during the taste test nearly effing killed me! Was wearing headphones ☠😂 I need a content warning 😂
Way cool ! 🎃
Shane's looking snatched!!
Loves it
The skeleton sells out every year since it came out.
VLOG-O-WEEN
I hope they can keep these babies alive longer than their kitten
French gurl here !! Poulette is basicaly what we call a chicken, in french its 《une poule》 for à female chicken and 《un coq》 for à mâle chicken, so poulette is a cute way to say chicken in french basicaly
Instead of a Halloween vlogmas it could be vlogween
Good
It is very interesting video I liked that video and nice
good
Is you Google still set to LA time? I had to change my settings when i moved tome zones
I watch nightmare before Christmas during Halloween time
Love seeing your Halloween decor. I got my boyfriend to buy us the 13ft Jack skeleton for our house. Also Spirit Halloween has a oogie boogie inflatable costume… would love to see you guys buy different inflatable costumes and try them on for a video if you guys are up for it!
Shane you look really good !!
I have not expressed how I actually feel about my career ever, and I’d like to. To anyone that will hear my story, thank you. I’m a float RN at a level one trauma center.  Last night, I was in charge on my favorite unit. I was so happy to be there. Other units can bring on hard challenges that honestly at times I’m not ready to face mentally. My physical being can and will do the job, but my brain is run down from what I do. Last night was a break, and boy am I thankful for it.  Multiple patients complimented me last night. Was that because I was finally happy? I danced after a patient asked me if I loved what I do, which is something I will always respond yes to. This isn’t because I always love my job, it is because patients who go out of their way to ask you that are seeing you love your job. Which is exactly what this patient said, “you can really tell that about you”. I’m not always happy. I’ve been told before my emotions fill a room. It is something that stuck with me, and I feel guilty every day that I’m not happy because my patients likely can notice it on me despite my efforts to not let an unhappy version of myself show. Even if it doesn’t show, the guilt remains. Guilt has been a constant feeling since becoming a nurse because even when I’m doing my absolute best, I never feel as though it was enough.  There isn’t a moment at my job that I can go without caring. There isn’t even a lot of time to consider taking a break, especially as a charge nurse required to cover others breaks.  I used to think being a charge nurse was a break. It’s not. I could go into all I do when I’m in charge, but this isn’t about that. I’m overworked and maybe I do that to myself, but I can’t give myself a second to not care about what is going on with the patients I am responsible for while under my care. These are lives.  I’m 25 years old. I began my career at 22. I have endured the stress of this responsibility for over 3 years. I graduated in May 2020, you know, the year COVID came into play. I graduated and went straight into the field. I was put on the COVID unit for months.  Nothing put this time period into perspective for me than when I recently spoke to some of my old high school friends that shared their experiences with me during the first year of COVID. It was a time period that they reflect on and say they enjoyed because they were able to spend quality time with their household. I’m very happy this was their experience and also envious. I was afraid I was going to bring home the virus and bring on the worst for my grandparents that lived in the same household as me. I think back on COVID lockdown and I don’t remember it, it is a time period that is completely removed from my mind. I heard trauma does that to you.  I’ve spent many moments questioning this career choice during the past three years. I believed I was destined to be nurse. It came with a cost. There have been many moments of feeling that I lost myself along the way. Back in college, I was a girl with friends. I enjoyed going on breakfast dates with my besties, going to the bar with my now fiancé, shopping with my mom, and going out with my dad on his motorcycle. I used to be fun. Now all I want to do is sleep. I heard depression does that to you.  At one point during my shift last night I saw an article regarding the death of Tristan Kate Smith. My heart shattered as I realized I related to her story despite me preaching that I love my job. Please research her story, which I hope can help with understanding mine.
Vlogoween?? That could work
27:21 😂😂😂 i said the same thing! Of course my boyfriend got it 😅 Much love from Arizona 💜💜
Wander full
Kouig amann is butter butter butter, sugar sugar sugar, more butter and some pate feuilletée! It’s typical from Bretagne in France and it is HEAVEN. And like 10 000 calories ❤️😂
Please watch Nightmare Before Christmas! Now that you have oogie boogie, you have to ((: it’s so good I promise
I'm sure she probably already told you, but poulette is French for chicken 🐔 Ryland was on point. 😊 Also loving the long hair!
Hi guys!! I miss your guys. I’ve been busy w school and haven’t had time for YouTube.
as a canadian, i forget that americans don’t know basic french, like poulet (chicken)
Ryland KEEP this hair look I love itttt
I can''t lie. I hate these titles. 30+ minutes to 'address something' and it's 99% not that.
27:12 aww Shane’s “yes”🥹
Just blur faces in photos
Im so confused why they’re going to LA to raise the babies when their family is in CO 🥲
Thanks love it
Just another mom suggesting that maybe you should start off in Colorado with the new babies. Definitely up to you two overall but no matter how prepared you are the more help the better when it comes to newborns. Either way you guys got this and im so happy for you! Also The Nightmare Before Christmas can be watched for either Halloween or Christmas lol.
I’m a lemon girl so that lemon macaroon thing looks amazing lol
Poulet is chicken is French so I assume the te makes it feminine? *cries in Canadian French*
Shane is so effing lazy! Its annoying! Does he realize he actually has to take care of 2 babies, right??? Ryland is in for a divorce later on.
super super
super
Vlogoween 🤞🤞🤞
So I have the same boogie boogie Inflatable I bought him from home depot last year only thing that's different is  he's holding dice instead of a pumpkin he's so kool I love him so much
Wow Amazing
Shane sleeping until 12pm lol be ready boys. Ya'll aren't sleeping in or hardly sleeping at all with 2 babies on the way lmao
SHANE!!!! Nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween AND Christmas movie!!!
VLOGOWEEN
Poulet is French it means chicken :)
Wait hold on, are we just going to look over the fact that you said 1. You haven’t seen a nightmare before Christmas and 2. That it’s a Christmas movie?! NO! Lol it’s both Halloween and christmas! 😅
Yes, poulette is a female chicken in French although im not sure it’s scientific 😂
Vlogaween!!! 🧡🧡🧡
VlogOWeen! 😂 I love how big Halloween is in America. Wish it was like that in the UK 🇬🇧
You’re having TWINS and you can’t even get out of bed before 12pm 🙄
No Christmas vlogs? 🥺
NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS THEME!!!!! It’s the perfect combo halloween and Christmas
OBVIOUSLY You guys know what's best for your babies. But I hope at least a photo.  I understand if not because it's truly a great big creepy world but...I wanna see them😭. But I also get why not....
Nice
Vlogoween!!
The fact Ryland doesn’t know what the nightmare before Christmas has me shook!! I literally watch that movie a billion times during halloween and Christmas lol.
The cookie effects😂 amazing
The skylight and clouds in your car is beautiful
good
Please we want vlogsmas! :)
I love Vlogtober
Full term for twins is usally 36weeks. Twin mom here..we also have fb group. Having twins & multiples support
Shane is no help
❤❤❤
The trick with these sort of business hours is to call before you even head out and politely ask them to set items aside. They dont like to stay open if no one is coming so if you call before they’ll stay open. Hope this works shout me out if you end up using this advice especially on the pod ❤you guys to the moon and back ive been a shane subby since his garage/before shanana days. 💕🇨🇦
Ryland your hair is looking so nice!
Awww you’re gonna have two lovely Sagittarius ♐️ babies ❤
Wow very so nice..... ❤❤
Shopping and eating junk….again…wow…not
Ilove all of the decorations
Ok but Shane is looking so good! And Rylands love for decorating and everything like I just love them so much. I watch their videos on repeat everyday just because they are so “feel good” to me if that makes sense lol
I love all of the beautiful decorations.
It's amazing
Ryan with beard!!!! Ohk ❤❤❤🎉
Thumbs up
😂😂 it’s shyland blackhole for me
*knock* *knock* *knock* "overpriced" 😭😭😭 -shane to ryland
😊😊
My neighbor has that big skeleton omg her whole outside is skeleton 💀 ☠️ I want one hell my yard is big enough to have haunted hay ride but to expensive to buy all the stuff but I really want one but no one EVER EVER comes down my driveway lol it's scary at night.
Just so you know Ryland, it’s probably not eating the grass itself that makes Uno sick. Cats and dogs just usually eat grass when they’re already feeling sick because they want to throw up to feel better. 😅
Volgoween
This is my inspiration... to be financially stable to get my own home and decorate as much as I want... I love it! Can't wait to see the journey with ur twin boys.
Shane brought up Christmas now I can’t stop singing “ MAYBE THIS YEAR I WONT BE SAD ON CHRISTMAS “
Omggggg you should do a nightmare before Christmas for your Vlog!!
All I could think of when you were reviewing the cakes/cookies was “baked in a buttery flakey crust”
“Vlogoween”
Nightmare b4 Christmas is both a Halloween movie and Christmas.
This is so fun :D You can have a Vlogoween :D haha
My birthday is on December 15th 😭 manifesting the best for you all ❤
Shane being friends with Colleen Hoover is the 2023 crossover i NEEDED
good
Shane looks like he’s losing so much weight! Im so proud of him!!
You two are going to be the best parents 💞
Shane’s in for a wake up call when his twins arrive cuz you can kiss waking up at noon goodbye lol
Your guys’ Colorado home is EVERYTHING
nice
Gd
Nice legs ryland ❤
Vlog-o-ween
nice
😂
We are in spring here in new Zealand. Over the rain and cold  . I want that Bakery here I would go all the time
Vlogaween
Ryland your hair looks amazing!
You should call it Vlogoween!!
I love how much Ryland and Shane care about child exploitation, it honestly shows how good of people they both are. ❤
I love Shane I miss shanaynay in my head is “don’t lie” lol
Nice
VLOGWEENN!!!
'Haul'oween, Vlogoween,... 😍
Make the vlogmas about the babies start November 1 with Christmas lol
Vlogoween for Halloween vlogs😂
frpm google search macroon vs macron  For starters, these two cookies are constructed in totally different ways. French macarons are sandwich cookies. They consist of two halves of delicate, airy cookie with a layer of filling in between. Architecturally, they're like brightly colored Oreos AND  By comparison, macaroons are fairly dense, ambiguously shaped dollops of coconut-flavored cookie, baked to a moderate shade of golden brown.
Have you seen permanent Christmas lights? Then you can theme as necessary and never have to hang! Wooo!!!
You guys can do shorts for vlogmas since newborns will need your undivided attention but also sleep a lot at the same time. I cant believe theyll be born so soon! Time flies ❤
I'd love to see a Vlogoween
I want that fuzzy tan hoodie thing Shane had on! So cute
Vlogoween 🎃👻
Loving Rylands hair like this!
Cronut
Super
Idea! Put up the lights now, but don’t turn them on. when December 1 hits have mom come over to the house and turn them on
Update on the alpacas ???? 🦙🐖🐈 Also- 🧡💜Vlogween💜🧡 Or 💜🧡Hallowvlog🧡💜
Fav couple 😭❤
Why do we always see Ryland do something around the house? What does Shane do, honestly?
Dogs eat grass when they have an upset stomach. It's good for them.
Ryland and Shane, you guys seriously put me in the mood for the spooky season! Your Vlogmas last year was such a blessing to watch. I loved seeing your decorations, food taste tests, suprise gifts and life with the fam and pets. Thank you for always making such light-hearted, sweet and comforting videos, and always extra long which I sincerely appreciate. Warm wishes for the next few months with the twins, I'm a twin myself and I know twins can be hard for parents, but the love and dedication you guys have for your babies makes me so happy that they will be so adored and appreciated by you two ❤❤❤
Vlogoween! Yes, please!! They Decorations are sooo cute!
Hi
I love the idea of vlogaween
ryland and shane realllyy need to watch Nightmare Before Christmas frfr
Fellow Ordinary Adventure stans RISE UP @ORDINARYADVENTURE S
I like this decoration
VLOGOWEEN!
Shane's mood in the video
I love the alpacas they’re sooooo cuttteeee 🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍
I look forward to the holiday vlogs & baby updates 🧡🍁🎃 Just an idea on vlogging becoming new parents I seen someone recently vlog while the child was young but once they got closer to going to school they stopped showing their face.
First off excuse me shane nightmare before Christmas is both a Halloween and Christmas movie 😅
Why don't you be a good boy and cut your hubby's hair while he's sleeping. Because it screams greasy and depressed.
VLOGOWE’EN!!! 🎉
Google, is the nightmare before Christmas a Christmas movie or a Halloween movie?   Answer: “If you ask the director, Henry Selick, he has a very direct answer. As you can imagine, the original cast and crew have been asked this exact question over the years. "It's a Halloween movie," Henry confirmed during a Q&A about the movie at Colorado's Telluride Horror Show film festival in 2015.”
Why are you staying in LA!!!!! Bring the babi es to Colorado straight away 🥹🥹
I dont want you guys to break up bc i know you guys fight. Can yall go to couples therapy 😭
YESSS!! VLOGGOWEEN! 🖤🖤
Ryland hair transplant slays
In three months you are having twins are you ready for that? Have you taken parenting classes or anything
Shane taping on Ryland then saying overpriced 😂😂😂😂
Awww my twin girls birthdays are Jan 15th they are 2  and sending sm love to y’all sm!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am SO excited for you to have your babies! I know you don’t want to show them at first, but if it makes YOU happy, trust that some of your viewers (me specifically) do NOT mind and will never judge!!!! I’m so excited ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤nice❤❤❤
Nightmare before Christmas is my personality still and im 30
Ok but you NEED to name your scarecrow "Scaryl Crow" like Sheryl Crow
The moment when Ryland quickly walked by a very fat, cute, and adorable Cheeeto eating on the counter! Glad to see he his fat and fabulous :)
@ordinaryadventures
OMG DECEMBER 15! they will be born the same day I was OHHHH I LOVE 🙌🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🥰 haha enjoy your sag babies were fun and amazing🥰🙌🏽😂🫶🏽 can’t wait for you guys to be parents
Hallo Vlog Ween or Hallo Vlog Week
I litterly work 2 minutes from that Dutch bros how do I keep missing yall
Thanks for keeping me entertained while I'm up in the middle of the night feeding my newborn!! ❤❤❤
Hallow Vlogween!
About the bakery name!! Poule ; chicken/hen. Poulette ; a young chicken/hen. Also, yes the pumpkin sandwhich cookie was a Macaron, a Macaroon is the drop style cookie with shredded coconut.
Shane is really not a morning person and I can relate so damn much 😂
Ya'll could call it Vlogoween!
Wait my brain is just comprehending that y’all are literally going to be whole parents before the new year!!!!! Like what????? I can’t believe it is happening so soon 🤯
Aww, I love you guys!
Vlogoween would be fun!
I love you guys so much. It kills me to see folks dog you two about your parenting before you’ve even brought your babies home! The clip that has caught people’s attention, (about showing the kiddies in vlogs) has me feeling like, why can’t you show folks how happy, Healthy and beautiful they are and leave it at that? I hope when you do that, and don’t “use them for content” like I’ve heard some say..that those people actually acknowledge that. I’m so excited for you guys and am on pins and needles to hear how amazing feels for y’all to have your bundles of joys at home!
That’s frfr me 4:19 I always tell my bf I ain’t leaving the house until I have made room for a “possibly take out” because he loves to try new food he just moved to my home state too (texas) Btw y’all guys look good leaving the house like that I can never
Why isnt shane wearing his wedding ring?
Nyc
Happy Vlog-O-Ween!
Listen, I love you. But these tacky decorations in this beautiful house KILLS me. I just can’t. Lol
No matter what the channel morphs into I hope to continue to see your post and share bits of your life because it really does bring so much joy to myself and many. I love you both and wish you nothing but the best as these exciting months come to pass. Here’s to healthy babies and a happy, beautiful life to you all ❤
🎃 👻 👽 🧙‍♀️ 😈 🕷 🕸 🕷 🕸 🕷
OK! let's all go oogie boogie
MY BIRTHDAY IS DECEMBER 15th
Yes Ordinary Adventures shout out! We live them!
It's Vlogaween !!!! 🎃
Will Shane change his sleeping schedule once the babies come?
They are going to have my daughters birthday!
Vlogtober Baby!
SUPER CUTE! Love it
Hear me out. 3 of those giant skeletons. Position them randomly, partially hiding behind trees looking out at people driving by!
"ew its in ur fart position" lmfao
UR BABIES ARE GONNA BE SAG'S i feel blessed and honored to share a zodiac sign with them. They are guaranteed fantastic people already good for u guys
Someone on my road has one the 12ft skeletons and took some rope and attached it to 2 skeleton dogs, so it look like he is out walking his dogs.
Poulette is french for female chicken❤loved the porch decorations ❤❤❤
You can hire someone to put up lights on the trees and house if you'd like lights to be done 😂 I have a baby coming this april for easter. ❤ i live about a 2 day drive from my family and this will be my 1st and probably only baby. Hopefully all goes well! Husband gets 3 months of full paid leave which is amazing.
Shane is looking so amazing as always
! Slapping His Hand ,')(
! Best, Very Best
I was hoping you guys were gonna have the babies in Colorado not in California... 😅
Halloween vlogmas could be vlogoween. 🦇🎃
I would love to see vlogoween
❤❤❤❤
Is he a cowboy? No. He's a fiesta.
27:10 Vlogween or Hallowmas ?
Poulet is literally the word chicken in french. 😂
you guys should sell the LA house and just move to Colorado permanently, you both seem happier in Colorado
The way Shane’s attitude changed after he pooped lmao 😂❤️
I wasn't screaming...I was encouraging 😂😂😂you
Poulette means chicken (girl only)
"Does the Tesla go fast?" 😂
Awww your twins are going to be Sagittarius’ !! Im a Sagittarius ♐️ yay!
VLOGOWEEN
I love that Shane thinks the giant skeleton is new but it’s been around years lol (in Canada at least)
I always watch nightmare before Christmas at in October and December
I’m all for a “vlog-O-ween”!!!
Nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween and Christmas movie! I watch it for both every year 😂
If you need Halloween and Xmas decor you should just do night mare before Christmas theme and then it's both
Am I the only one who thinks..... we need that skeleton????? It is so you guys!!!!
I loooove the purple and orange lights!!!!
Hear me out : The nightmare before Christmas is the perfect movie transition from fall to christmas. Let's all watch it on the night of the 1st of November.
Ok, BB live feeds?  Who are y’all rooting for?  I’m watching them way too much 😅
Not Vlog-Mas  🎄but  Vlog-O-Ween 🎃!!!
Acre Homestead handles her baby on her channel brilliantly, spoke about the birth process, showed him once and then now respects his privacy and hides him but doesn't act like he doesn't exist, she's had him crying in the background and has spoken about him in some videos but the camera isn't shoved in his face, we've seen him, we know he exists, but we're here for momma  I think having that same mindset would be great for you two, show them off once or twice, respect their privacy until they're old enough to consent to being on camera, but you can still be parents and talk about it.
*watching this after just waking up at 6am for work*   Shane: They close at 1pm but i woke up early just so we could make it...
do a nightmare before christmas theme!!!! <3
Why aren't the babies going to Colorado???
We, the People, have to see the Littles at least once! Pawlease…
Hail Eris
Babies under the tree is what I see 💝 god bless
Am so happy for babies so sad for no blog mis 😢
Was Cheeto still eating 😂
I’ve never been so offended when Shane said nightmare before Christmas was a Christmas movie, like nooooo😭😭😭
Vlogoween!!!!!!
Pls never stop making videos ❤❤u and Shane are my fav YouTubers forever 💓
NBC is a Halloween &Christmas movie. It's amazing I LOOOOOVE THAT MOVIE❤❤❤❤
Good
Can they call it VLOGOWEEN please
Ugh the LA house. Not looking forward to the return to shallowtown.
If y’all don’t go get Lewis the jackolantern from target ima cry
I dropped 400 for the  13ft animatronic Jack and he's worth every single cent.  IncludingtheinterestonthecardthatI'llbepaying it's fiiiiiiiine.  I'm having a santa hat made for him and I'm leaving him up through Christmas.  Winning!!
Hear me out...green lights need to be added to complete the Halloween color pallette! But also, Ryland is SUCH a MOM. I love it. And his hair in this vlog is HAIRING, big purr to that 💕✨️
I need that chocolate cake pie looking thing in that shop Ryland I need you to send this to me it looks so good ❤😅
im like shane. dont bother me till i poop. then ill be in a better mood lol 😂😂
Ryland should make Halloween blogs a thing. Lol and ryland is the ultimate man of the house doing all the labor. 😁
I love all of the decorations
Y’all’s little loves spats are funny! 😆 about Ryland n the multitasking thing lol. 😆
a macaroon and a macaron are two different things
Nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween AND Christmas movie!!!
VLOGOWEEN!!!!!!
THANK YOU FOR SAYING MACARON I HATE WHEN PEOPLE CALL THEM MACAROONS…. Macaroons are a completely different cookie
I’m team Halloween vlogmas!
VLOGOWEEN?!?!
Another “as a twin mum” but honestly you cannot even fathom how HARD it is when they’re born…. Please gather a support network! ❤ you’ll need all the help.
Love the purple and orange!!
Technically The Nightmare Before Christmas is both a Halloween and a Christmas movie
Won’t lie, ryland gives off the same energy as kris Jenner
Everytime you talk about not being in this house for months i’m always so sad for the alpacas!? Like… why did you get them if you are not there anymore? I’m NOT judging I’m genuinely asking because i’m sad for them
Poulette is a french word and you actually said it right! 😊
Ryland, I am LOVING the hair!!
The alpacas dont get to meet the babies ... who cares for the alpacas? Do all the pets travel to Cali with yall?
Get another orange an purple set of lights and candy cane them on each side
You can show the backs of their heads that way their ids are still protected
Them not knowing oogie boogie was made of bugs and moths, so of course he attracts them
Poulette is a hen
Your babies and my little girl are due around the same time!!! ❤❤❤❤ super excited.
Shane’s energy at the beginning of the video is literally me😂
i wish i had a relationship like this. patient & kind & loving.
What camera do you use?
Okay. Yall could have just bought the 12ft. one that was right there when you were looking at cheaper probably $250 if it was a display. They would have sold that display to yall.
J meant please let us see the boys when they're born pretty pretty pretty please Shane and Ryland we need to see         ❤ Jet and Parker ❤
Y'all better show us in babies we are a big part of y'all's life to you know we got to see Parker and Jet we have to you have to let us seize your son's pretty pretty pretty please!❤❤
Jet and Parker are y'all Christmas gifts to each other
I’m with you Shane! Put up the lights 😝
It’s called vlogtober ryland
Poulet is chicken in French!! That would be why it was chicken themed lol
Light crunch and chewy is how they're supposed to be 🍰
Hallowvlog 🎃
Poulette means ‘chick’.
I swear this are my FAVORITE videos from y’all!💗 I look forward for holidays inspiration from y’all’s videos 😊🫶🏾 as well from watching all y’all’s other videos
Not me watching this and being like Ryland is right, its a macaron. Macaroons and Macarons are 2 different things.
Ryland! Your hair is GIVING! 🔥💥💥
Get the skelly! They keep saying they’re discontinuing him 😢
Sometimes people do show their babies on social media until they become toddlers. Because babies change so much until they enter that stage.
Omg, it's VLOGOWEEN
Macaroons and macarons are two different desserts lol
The bakery needs a sign saying they got Shylands Black Hole for chocolate cup cookie and Bissant. 😂
Nightmare before Christmas isn't really a Christmas movie because the nightmare is Halloween
I’m totally trying out this bakery! I work in Parker 2 days a month
Good broccast
Y’all could do Vlog-o-ween for October!
“A croisciskit… A BISSANT!”😂😂
Happy Hallovlog!!! 😂
Cute! Love your decorations 🎉Happy HalloThanksMus!
Omg u need to sell some of your alpca stuff once it's knitted!!!
sagittarius babies!!
A BISSANT
It's fall yall  sounding like sponge Bob!
Vlogtober??🎉🎉🎉
Do we stan Cory from bb25 love him
Vlog-O-ween
Shane is looking so good. He really is starting to look more healthy mentally.
of all possible authors, it had to be colleen hoover? 😭
Super cute!
Imagine coming home with the babies to a home that’s decked out with Christmas stuff. You’re not going to be able to do much after they come so it’s perfect to do it now or soon!
"The Nightmare Before Christmas" is both a Halloween movie and a Christmas movie, the cult doesn't know! We just go with WHATEVER DISNEY IS DOING!! LOL ha ha ha...Also, Can you two please do the ghost trend on all your dogs, we would die of cuteness to see that!!! Please I beg of you
Babies are coming on my wedding day! How exciting!!!!
Vlogoween!!!!!!
This sounds like the nightmare  before Christmas theme .. 😁😁i In the Caribbean 🇵🇷, we start Christmas celebrations Ann’s decorations  early . Nothing wrong with that.
I am loving Ryland and Shane’s ordinary adventures era 🤣🤣
It's ok if y'all take it easy for this Christmas; you'll be very busy & we will understand. Christmas comes every year & should the Juniors arrive before this one, it'd be super special if it was an intimate "babies' first Christmas" time. Next year, you can get silly-pants! 🎃🎄👼
Vlog-o-ween
Talk more with your mouth open looking bad
Your starting looking like each other. Dirty not showered shabby not put together  your to old for the look of a 20 year old person your looking 45
Rylan is looking ruff as well take a shower
Shane's hair  makes him look larger not cute and the come over side addition aweful
Ryland, there's an Alpaca Farm down in my home town. About 6 hours from Parker, Pagosa Springs. They might be able to help you with their fur and making things because we used to go there on field trips and make things! I would definitely give them a call and see if they can help you❤
I am living for Shane's reactions 😂😂
I always look forward to your Halloween/Fall and Christmas decorating day videos 🍁
They grow up so much🐰
Literally me!!! “LETS GO ITS FALL YALL” literally has been me since august
Ryland, your hair was serving this vlog ❤
TRY DANIELS OF PARIS IN AURORA
This vlogmas will be the best one you guys have ever had because it will end with a babiesss❤❤❤ I hope you don’t shy away from the dad content. I have watched you guys fall in love & date forever then get married. I am so excited for you guys. I put this up there with when I found out Beyoncé was pregnant!
Cheeto always be eating 😹
Yall i love it and you should take it as a compliment
“ a BISSANT”😭😭😭
I *love* the Ghost Uno. Also, you guys *NEED* to see Nightmare Before Christmas, 'cuz the fact you haven't is a *p-p-problem.*
Dude my husband is the same wayyyy. He can’t multitask and it kills me, but I love him 🤣
Love this but nightmare before Christmas is both Halloween and Christmas just saying 😂😂. But I think y'all should decorate for Christmas too 😅
Your content is always so uplifting!! Thank you !   And yes decorate for Christmas
3:49 so wait yall thought it closed at 1 but it was actually 2 and yall still didn't make it?!? Google tried to throw yall a bone!
2:57 my husband is the same and then he says the same bogus shit about me and not being able to do 2 things at once
There’s a new bakery here in Parker by Trader Joe’s called Paris baguette. HIGHLY recommend!
Please don’t show the babies. There are awful people (pe*os) on here waiting for exactly this and using this for god knows what… ugh. Please do not do them the pleasure of giving them that material, keep your babies to you and respect their privacy please please please 🙏🏻
please do a fall vlogmas instead!!!!
VLOGOWEEN
IM READY FOR VLOGOWEEN
am i the only one terrified for how they're gonna manage youtube and fatherhood😭 like i have abandonment issues pls💔
When did they switch from the g wagon to a tesla?
there’s something so haunting about seeing shane out in public. bro should be locked up somewhere.,
YESSS YALL DO A VLOGAWEEN
EW SHANE MINIONS ACTIVATE MY FIGHT OR FLIGHT!
okay but like, Shane is right!! y'all should totally get lights put on the Colorado house! because I assume y'all will fly home for Christmas Day to be with your family, right? so getting to pull into your driveway with the twins and seeing all the Christmas lights & decorations would be so magical 🥰
Rumors say that this is the last year to get the 12ft skeleton because it’s getting discontinued…
Love the Halloween decorations!!! What if you took every second bulb from each strand and changed it out for the other, that would look cool.
Shane and I are like the same person 😂🤣
I started Christmas alittle early too when I was pregnant! Had my daughter December 20th
Christmas in Colorado hits DIFFERENT than in LA
Why do you have to have the babies in LA for a while ? I thought you guys were selling that house ?
Poulet is French for chicken. It is (poo- Leigh). :)
Omg PLEASE have Coleen Hoover on the podcast!!!
same ryland my brain can literally only do one things I literally can not focus on two things at once lmao
Being honest I really want to meet the boys, they will be so loved and it feels so special, but they have the right to say and do what's best for them,  wish you luck and happiness 🎉❤
Yall should get those lights installed that stay up year round, Theryre called like Everlights, and can be turned just white for non holidays, and, like theres themes for each holidays, even like red white blue, and halloween, christmas. It would be so cute!
Halloween is not just a holiday it’s a lifestyle! I’m obsessed and I must say Shane, how could you say the skeleton was too much but have the most Christmas decor I’ve ever seen 😂 lmao. Shane I really love you because I can’t fw people that decorate for Christmas in September. For you I’ll make an exception 🫶🏻 side note Ryland is the best decorator around
I feel like shane trys to hard
We have the same due date! Eek! We’re getting there!!
honestly “a nightmare before christmas” is a perfect decoration theme for your guys, it combines both seasons!!
forget vlogmas, it’s FALLMAS Y’ALL
My birthday is December 15th🥰
I cannot wait for these boys to be born and to watch you both become the most amazing daddy’s 😢 I’ve been here since the beginning of Shane and I’m still here forever xx I love you both so much ! Becoming a parent is the most amazing blessing the world can give, I have two girls 2 & 3 and they have changed me so much but for the better ❤❤❤
Shane will be the Silky mom
Ryland is going to be such an Almond mom 🤣
#vlogween
💙💙
I'm a twin, our birthday is December 15th, that's crazy
What about making VLOGWEEN a thing🤔 I’m here for it🙌🏽
Nightmare before Christmas should of been the theme of your house bc it’s a perfect midway of both so you don’t have to decorate one at a time it’s both Christmas and Halloween
create private social media accounts for sharing baby/child pics, please! your presence is too big to share their faces imo.
Very good video
Why are you guys going to be living in California when the babies are born? I feel like Colorado is like… the “family” house.
Love the orange and purple lights, and the green oogie just makes it!  But I do hope you find the skeleton!
Love the ordinary adventure reference😂
Just do vlogmas early, combine it with halloween, and call it "Nightmare Before Vlogmas" 😂
Yall are my comfort youtubers
Poulette is like the female version of chicken in french haha :)
Fallmas 🫶🏼
"I'm so glad I pooped". 😅😅😅😅 Been there
Get permanent Christmas lights! Then you can pick your color schemes for every holiday and you don’t have to be home to turn them on! 🥹
You’re gonna have Sagittarius babies!!! Soo excited for y’all. Sagittarius squad 💖
Vlogoween pleeeease!!!!
Shame looks so good and healthy
Nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween AND Christmas movie 😂😂
Nightmare before Christmas is just as much a halloween movie. Please watch it ryland
i know colleen! went to high school with her son! My aunts good friends with her that's so crazy!
I’m due December 10th! So excited for you!🩵🩵
Nightmare before Christmas is the best it's a need to watch ❤❤
I’m in Lakewood, I’m definitely going down to Parker to try this now
As a twin mom 3 years in, I can say that I would’ve not survived if I was not close to our family. We HAD to use them so often that first year and still rely on them a lot.
Poulette means "young/little hen"😅
I always do my makeup while watching you & totally lost it and messed up my eyeliner when shane said ”eww he’s in your fart position” about the sceleton 💀 lol happy spooky season 👻
Plz one shout out for Govisko  !
Vlog-o-ween ❤
Shed of honesty 😂😂
VLOGOWEEN
omg shane simpson
so jealous!! I miss having my own place :( so excited for Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas!!!!!!!!!!!! <3 & vlogmas.
"There's so much to do today, I'm so glad I pooped!" 😂😂😂 words to live by
Maybe yall should do Christmas on Thanksgiving so you can relax on  Christmas together with your babies.
I love this vlog-O-ween video!!! Like yasss!!! Okay but I love how shane always comes up with the best jokes fr😂 It never gets old! 🖤
Film in november, post in december!
11:36 is one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen Shane do 😂😂😂  I can’t stop rewinding 🍪
Please enjoy it. Please continue to make good videos👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Is it okay to compare them to Cam and Mitch from Modern Family??? Cam is Shane and Mitch is Ryland to the T!!!!!
VLOGOWEEN WOULD BE ICONIC
Shane is looking so SKINNY lately! Love the journey!
Lmao I love y’all
IDK if anyone has said this or not but VLOG-o-ween would be perfect lol 😊
Poulette means Chick.
I forgot about the other house. How long will they stay over there in la ?
Oh man their baby gets here I’m December? Woahh
Ok can we just talk about how cute Shane & Ryland look when they're matching??? Also, the real question is: is Daddy (Shane) gonna give us another Halloween special?!?!? We LIVE for it <3
absolutely missed the opportunity for Nightmare BEFORE Baby Christmas, especially with it being the 30th anniversary! 🎃 👑 🎅🏼  EDIT: i wrote this just before the TNBC part lol
Ryland's boundless energy has me green with envy. I feel like the worst "home-maker"on the planet.  In other words: Fantastic job, sir. 💐
the two tone is ADORABLE RYLAND
Vlog aween
Yall always need to address something!!
Vlog-tober for sure omg
THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS IS NOT A CHRISTMAS MOVIE SHANE OMG SMDH why do u think theres a blow up oogie boogie with pumpkins around it bc it is both a halloween movie aaaaand a christmas movie KINDA lol
ryland and shane are gonna be the cool parents, when their twins boys bring their friends over and see all the nick-nacks in their house and all the best food😂😂
I’m hereeeee for starting vlogmas now
Happy Boo-Mas! :)
A name for vlogmas in Halloween could be vlogoween
Vlog-o-ween
The uno ghost dog decoration is my absolute favorite
what did they address?
Vlogoween
I didn’t think I would love the lights either but LUVVVV! ❤
I lovvve the lights!
The 4 boos are essential
#20 on attending 🎉
ryland and shane look the same now
I still think having the babies at Colorado seems so much better Obviously I'm not them but having babies a nice comfy warm home while it's cold outside, just sounds like the most warm fuzzy thing ever!
Anyone remember when “ Shane said little girls are hot “ weird that y’all support a odd thinker like that especially YouTube .
Shane is so me!! 😂😂🙈🙈
🎃🎃 VLOG-O-WEEN 👻👻
Vlogoween!!!!
Wait…no xmas in CO?  But…but what about Shane’s village?!!  I need that this year.
Shane has too many ideas for Ryland being our main and ONLY set decorator lol
I’ve also never watched Nightmare before Christmas but I know a lot of the characters names! Lol also, where’s Honey?! ❤
Me with my almost 5 month old at home freaking out for you all because babies are coming!!! Holy heck mid December will be here before you know it 😳 it’s gone by so fast
My 13 y/o and I tried for three years to get one of those big skeletons. This year we started looking in every Home Depot in the DC, Virginia, & Maryland area starting at the end of august, and finally nabbed one (with the chest lighting kit). It IS aggressively big. And we DO live in the city in DC with a postage stamp sized front yard, but we don’t care - we love him. His name is Jamison and our neighborhood stops to take photos with him (and his skeleton framily & skeleton pets that are doing something new daily). Tip: Home Depot releases its new Halloween collection for a very brief amount of time in June, and you can buy that stuff online (its the only time you can purchase the 12 ft skeleton online - they only stock them in store at the end of august/beginning of September) and be ahead of the game. A HD employee told me after seeing me and my child in the store daily before we finally found, and adopted, Jamison.   Happy Halloween! So excited for you guys to experience Halloween with your little boys. They’ll be old enough to get a kick out of Halloween next year (even if they’re not aware of what it is - you guys will LOVE it!)
poulette means chicken in french lol, its chicken bakery
Hello ryland and shane, I'm so happy that you were able to taste "kouign amann" 😊 It's a cake that comes from Brittany in France (where I come from). In Breton it means butter cake and I hope it's as good as in France 🇫🇷
please stop uploading :)
It’s a…. Fiesta lol no Shane that’s a Mexicat! Hahaha
You should get the giant jack skellington
Shane’s looking gorg as always
Yes to vlog-ween! 👻
What is the fresh hell is this content?
More kid touches.... really?
Love your content, as always, Shane and Ryland! Perhaps you could do a VlogaWeen instead of Vlogmas for this year
Love you guys macaroons are coconut, macaRON is what you ate , love your videos ,I always look forward to your next video 😊
ITS VLOGOWEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
vlogtober!!
I live out in the country. Hay fields, co s and horses. Two of my neighbors have those 13 foot skeletons. One keeps it up all year. They have it by a tree. They decorate the skeleton and tree foe all holidays. It’s for for to see what the skeleton will be wearing each holiday.
Ima slap you(not really) Nightmare before Christmas is BOTH Halloween and Christmas you can watch it October, November, and December
I CROCHET!!! If YOU GUYS SEND ME SOME OF THE YARN I WOUOD MAKE U GUYS BEANIES!!!!
❤❤❤
Vlogaween!
Vlogoween
I'm sad your having your babies in LA :( I love your Colorado home and family is there. I wish you the best in LA for the first few months!
Vlogween
I’m so here for vlog-WEEN
Obviously it’s gotta be Happy Vlog-o-ween🎉🎃
Nooo; nightmare before christmas is halloween and christmas movieeee
Nightmare before Christmas is both Halloween and Christmas! And you seem like you would love that movie😂😅 that’s my moms personality
Vlog-o-ween!
Debatable Shane... Nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween movie in my opinion.
Vlog-a-ween!
I come from the region in France where Kouign Aman come from (Brittany), it litterally means something like "butter cake" - so you can't really go wrong with that !! 😄
Shane and ryland videos give me so much comfort. 😍
"There's so much to do today, so glad I pooped!" ..... so relatable 😅
Happy Vlog-o-ween!!! 💜💚
Filipinos start decorating for Christmas in September, it's not insane lol
no way you guys know who ordinary adventures are
Only YouTubers I can watch from beginning to end 😂❤❤
Vloctober 😊 would love it ❤
Shane is looking skinny, skinny queen! is that offensive?
Dont hate me but i only watch these because shane is in them!!!! He needs more of his OWN videos.... Plz plz plz plzzzzz 😢 love you Shane
I might have missed it but why are you guys starting with the babies in Cali?? Just wondering! Super excited for you both 💙💙
“Rylands black hole” takes me out everytime 😂
I’m not typically triggered by people eating… However, I am overstimulated when Ryland goes “MMMM” when he eats. I can’t!!!! You can avoid doing so. I believe in you.
Ryland your hair is looking awesome!
Merry Halloween! Shane and Ryland 🩷
As soon as you said the baby date I put that in my calendar! ❤
The way I live thru them with all the holiday shopping 🥹 one day I will be able to buy whatever I want for my place
I’m here for a Vlogoween!!!
Nightmare before Xmas is actually a Halloween movie lol
Are y’all gonna get a nanny?
So if the surrogate lives in Seattle how does that work? Like will she come to LA to hav the babies or will she have them in Seattle and then bring them to California?
If Nightmare Before Christmas has taught us anything, it’s that the answer doesn’t have to be one holiday or the other. It can be both 😆🙌
Y’all need to watch Nightmare before Christmas ASAP.
As a mom of two who is from Ireland but living in the US, please stay near family. If I wasn’t close to my husbands family to get help and assistance on the bad days I would literally be in a psych unit by now lol. Use all the help you can get.
Omg I’m due Dec 17th !!!!
Vlogoween 🎃🎃🎃
Instead of Vlogmas it's Vlogaween
Wearing a Mountain Dew shirt and criticising french pastries. Tell me you are american without telling me you are american.
I get so excited when I see a new vlog! Like, Shane for Fall, level excited!! 😂😂❤❤❤
Hi ✨ sooo I'm french and a "Poulette" is a chick, kouign-amann (in Breton: kouign meaning "cake", and amann, "butter") is a pastry and a culinary specialty originally from the North West of France (a region called La Bretagne), it's made with puff yeast dough (the same used for croissant), semi-salted butter (a lot) and caramelized sugar ! 🇨🇵
This house is perfect for the family
Poulette is a cute name for Poule (hen)
Is no one else shocked that Shane didn’t figure out vlog-o-ween??
GUYS I know you have waaaayyyy more important things to worry about. BUT maybe get someone to take down the fall decor, at least the stuff that is important to you. You'll be in Cali and it will get COVERED in snow and get wet. Sorry to give you something else to think about >_<
My son was born on December 15th! He is the sweetest most imaginative child ☺️ He is super chill yet center of attention! Would be so cool to share that bday and I must say y’all are in for such a wonderfully beautiful experience.. I can not wait to see the both of you become dads!!❤️❤️
I love how shane rubbed off on Ryland and he's now a food review girly 😂❤
How could you possibly say no when Shane asked so nicely about bringing out the gingerbread woman? 🥺
Why do gays have to act so gay?
Shane putting that gorgeous hat on with the validation of “there’s a new sheriff in town” made my morning.
You should have titled this video “VLOGMAS DAY 1” 😂
Macaron and macaroon are different cookies, not different pronunciations lol.
Do thee purple and orange together it will look cute..
The nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween movie
The two different light colours are everything!
MACARON its a French word ask google !!!!
I can not wait to see how you guys take on parenthood, would love to see the transition. Hoping and wishing for a safe delivery and congratulations on becoming dads to precious twin babies!
🎃🎃🎃 VLOGOWEEN 🎃 🎃🎃
Loving the added sound effects ❤
Please tell us you both have terminal cancer....
I Wanna see the 13th foot skeleton
Nightmare Before Christmas is both a Halloween and a Christmas movie! Watch it twice a year! So jealous of US getting so much NBC merch
I need Halloween vlogmas
Omg the house looks good, ryland  really did his big one like always ❤❤
Does shane actually do anything? All I see is Ryland doing everything lol
No one cares get off the internet
Hi guys, I've worked with alpacas and I just wanted to say that the one separating herself from the pack maybe unwell or old ? Just from looking at her I can't properly assess her body score but I van see that her pelvis and spine are prominent. This means she's probably not being allowed to eat by the pack. I'd recommend just observing their behaviour at feed times and if that is the case then she needs to be fed separately as she looks to me to be too thin for an alpaca. ❤
this is cofe fe 😂😂😂
Can’t believe this garbage is trending…
VLOG - o - WEEN yes plsss
The reason a lot of people ( including me) love The Nightmare Before Christmas is because it’s both a Halloween and Christmas movie 🍿 💚
Happy fall 🎉🎉🎉
Regarding your babies, why not have someone take a photo of you both each holding one so we don't see their faces?
Shane is wearing a jacket, Rylan is wearing a short sleeve T-shirt, Shane is complaining his hot, is it obvious what the problem is? When my husband asked me what he should wear which he does quite often I always pick him out clothes that are gonna cause him to get hot so I can have the air running full blast
I love all of the decorations!
what about VLOGtober???
WOW SHANE!!! can we say how amazing he looks. The weight loss! Slay!!!!!
This is such a happy vlog.  There are so many funny moments.  I just love it.
VLOGOWEEN !!!  27:09
Vlog -oween!🎃
Vlogoween !
Loving the long hair vibe Ryland!
no its both hallowee & xmas hahaha :P my dad actually gifted my mom one when they first came out and than she got another one && she got the jack skellington big skeleton :P so now there is three lol soo cool! home depot actually sells this set where you can use it to put lights in the skeleton. but the 12th foot skeleton is sold out fast because my mom follows this facebook group and stuff drops online and you have to be quick to buy or go at the beginning of September when Halloween stuff is out lol   I also love minions! I saw the newest movie in theaters, super funny! lol
28:27 ROLLING ON THE FLOOR
Everything you guys eat is the best thing you’ve ever had in your lives, somehow.
I love Hoover!! Since her wattpad days. Also, Shane its already Christmas season in the Philippines. I give you my blessing to do lights and all sparkles

Vlog-o-ween
uh lowe's hello
Vlog-o-ween
Vlog-o-ween!
All babies look the same. I think it's funny when people cover their faces.
Oh my god y’all have never seen nightmare before Christmas😭
Vlogaween! 🎃👻
VLOGOWEEN !!!
We wish you wouldn't
I love watching the two of you interact and i just can relate to things that are being said and laugh so hard. Thank you for being you! Happy Vlogoween!!
That place is chicken in French! Also.. the it’s fall y’all Shane yells I need as a text tone!!! Lol 😂❤
NBC is both Halloween and Xmas movie Shane lol 😂
Yikes
you have to look up lewis the talking jackolantern
The way you said the macaron felt instead of being so hard is how it’s supposed to be! There’s just so many places that do them wrong.
Vlogoween! 💚💜💚💜💚
I actually found about Colleen Hoover because of Shane because she did a giveaway of the conspiracy pallet and I entered it!! 😆
The Night before Vlogmas
Shane looked nice in his outfit to go get coffee. ❤
Where did u and Shane meet
Haha Poulette is Poultry, an actually that was the original spelling of my last name. They changed it to Pouliot probably when they came to the US. Some still spell it that way too, it made me laugh a bit when I saw it since Colorado is a ways away from New England.
whY ARE you yELLinG😂😂😂😂
I haven’t laughed this much in a long time thankyouuu
You could call it Vlog-a-ween!!!! And then start vlogmas when you get to California!!
Yes I’m on board with Shane lol
Do a vlogoween.
Please vlogweeeen😶
*knock knock* "Over priced"  SHANE I AM DEAD!!!!!
would luv Halloween Octobmas ❤😊😊😊
WAIT why was I thinking this whole time you guys would bring the twins back to Colorado straight away… it’s such a wholesome family home and Ryland’s fam is close by!
Excuse you Nightmare Before Christmas is a Halloween and Christmas movie thank you very much!!! Jk but it really is lol 😊
This is the last Halloween decorating without babies, go nuts! 👻💜👻💜👻💜
Vlogoween! That’s my name suggestion 🎃
Shane looks so healthy and happy we love to see it 🥰
Do a hallothanksmas vlog😊
We will understand when jet and max are born! We just want them to be healthy babies! I am a little sad because Christmas looks better in Colorado! 😅💚💚💚💚
Vlogween!
Vlogaween
RYLAND!!! If you guys end up going to Florida for vacay I recommend going to universal city walk, you only have to pay for parking! They have various restaurants and a chocolate emporium with so many sweet and famous for their macaroons!!! You’ll love them I know it ❤️❤️ love you both !!! 😊
Hear me out… vlog-a-ween
The bakery food looked amazing, lil oogie was so cute and i vote halloween vlogs
on the Ryland and Lizzie channel, ryland comes off as such a bratty b*tch and then on this channel he fakes being a nice person
I was in such a upset mood all day, y’all always make me laugh though. Love y’all ❤
HALLOWEEN VLOGMAS IS VLOGOWEEN PLEASE DO IT!

Scarecrow name idea Shyland
6:42 “ITS FALL Y’ALL!” 🤣🍂🍁🎃
I’ve watched you Shane for years , thru all the ups and downs but I never lost faith in you , I love watching you and your husband and friends , you always brought a smile to my face on my darkest days. I can’t wait to get my $ fixed just hard right now talking care of my 15 son alone and my mom and dad and all of our fur babies lol but I can’t wait to get some merch it looks amazing and my bday is the 17 and my son is the 11 on December ❤ congrats on everything so happy to see you and your family doing so well!
VLOGOWEEN, Ryland! 🎃👻🙀
Vlogoween would be iconic
i  call    macarons  maccroons
When do you plan on telling the twins that they are actually half siblings because they share a mother and two different dads?
vlog-o-ween!!!!
Love the decorations! Super cute
Oggie and Ozzie from Helluva Boss would definitely hangout and be friends
Do a nightmare before Christmas theme!!!!
I’m so down for a vlog-o-ween!!! The last big hoorah before the babies come!!
Ryland the HAIR 😍 grow it out a little more
Ok Shane I need you to watch the Nightmare Before Christmas asap for Halloween & Christmas as it’s for both holiday and give us a reaction. But I love that you already love Oggie Boogie before you’ve seen him in the movie😃
I LIVE FOR THESE COUPLE DECORATING VIDEOS!!!
Ryland, buy that big ol Skeleton! I did and NO regrets! Enjoy it because it’s so much fun! Love you both so much! I live for a new video - your vlog channel cures my stress! ALWAYS so much fun and uplifting!
I lost it when Shane said "Its a bissant!" 😂😂😂
Shane is giving, never worked a hard physical day in his life…   Idk how he’s going to keep going to bed at 4am and waking up 12pm when those newborns are born.. I feel bad for Ryland
The massive skeleton has been a Canadian favourite for years. One of my neighbours keeps one out all year around and dresses it according to the season.
if you guys dont watch this movie i will freak
A VLOGOWEEN! 💀🎃
Tell me why after watching this I drove past someone’s house who had one of those big skeletons, I live in PA
Vlogoween 👻 ❤
VLOGOWEEN
The “bisant” part made me die
vlog-o-ween!
These are literally your last holidays with just you two! From now on until forever you will be celebrating as a family of 4❤
The fact that neither of you have ever seen Nightmare Before Christmas is mind blowing 🤯
19:56 as a mother of three, two of which were more at the end of November and the bevy of December. DO THE LIGHTS AT THE LA HOUSE. It will boost your mood and you’ll have great first Christmas memories!! Whether you vlog or not, make the memories for You. Having newborns around Christmas makes it SO magical. Regardless of the sleep deprivation. 🖤🖤🖤🖤
Vlogween
Rylands hair LOOKS AMAZING ❤
It's called a cronut guys lol ❤❤
Volg o ween !!!

I've missed y'all <3
Vlogoween! 😂
Hold up….. can we cancel Ryland for at least 5 1/2 minutes for NOT KNOWING NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS!!!!! LIKE HOW DO YOU NOT KNOWWWWW!!!!!!
12:56 I was waiting for both of you to pucker up when you guys bit into them 🍋 🍋 🥐
Shane....since you posted that you may be gaining weight due to coming off your meds.....you've been loosing weight, your looking gooooood Ryland.....im loving your hair that length ❤😘 xXx

You can always put rocks in the inflatables to keep them from blowing away as well
10:56 Shane! Well said! Great ! 5 🌟 presentation! 👏 👏
It’s a Halloween movie 24:31
I want to get some Vlog-O-Ween! Especially if Vlogmas will be limited. 🧡🎃

babies have the same birthday as me if they come on the due date😢❤
Yee Haw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yu'll come back now ya hear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My personality is still NMBC
VLOG-o-WEEEEEN!!!!
I believe it’s fine to decorate for Christmas. You could just say it’s the “Nightmare Before Christmas” and you’d fit in both seasons😂
I've had the Christmas idea also to start decorating
In the Philippines 🇵🇭, the whole country starts decorating for Christmas in September 🎄❤️💚
Rylands shaky hands with the Bissant has me cringing hahahaha but loved this video!!
I have banana cream pie weed.🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂 ITS FALL Yall
19:37 my husband trying to rein in my ideas and love for decorating
Truthfully I think you should decorate your Colorado home for fall, then decorate the LA house for Christmas. It just makes the most sense. It doesn’t have to be extraordinary or anything, just do something to make yourselves feel comfortable and happy and then enjoy that special time with your new borns first Christmas. 🖤
Hear me out: VLOGWEEN
Just a little sad that you’re starting the Dad journey in CA and not in CO. :(
make a list of times you will not film or share your child, and time that are okay to do so, make sure your both in 100% agreement.
It can be VLOGWEEN hahaha love you guys!!
vlog-o-ween
The nightmare before Christmas is definitely more of a Halloween movie you can watch it now lol
The bakery is pronounced poo-lay, it is French for Chicken :)
People put up christmas lights but its Halloween colors you guys could totally do that. Also love you both so much been a long term subscriber ❤️
🫳🫳🫳overpriced 😂😂😂
I’m sure youve already done this but make sure you’ve called pediatricians in both places ❤
My husband got me the huge skeleton for my anniversary present! I love it!
You two are going to be the best parents ❤
“Im not judging sweetie I’m taking notes”
here for the vlogoween!!
Pleaaaase dont show your babies! They deserve all the privacy they can get
VlogTober 🐿🧡
Shane is me before my coffee finally hits! Lol 😂
I’m lovingggg the fall contenttt and my birthday is Dec 15th 👀👀
Ryland is amazing. He just does it all and put in all that work and Shane just goes «Im already over it» 😅😂
We put up Halloween like 2 weeks ago.  I am ready!!!
Okay I’ve never seen a macaroon so big ❤ yumm
I’m not gonna lie, this look by Ryland in this video is good, I think he should keep his hair and beard like this
When Shane & Morgan’s video is currently trending
Call it "Vlog-o-ween" ✨️
We demand a VLOGOWEEN!!!!
Its call Vlogoween (per Grav3yardgirl).......super excited for it!!!
oooooo I crochet Ive never used alpaca yarn but Id totally buy some of yours
VLOG-OLEEN!
Misse opportunity: happy HOGMAS. Oink oink 🐷
The fall, Halloween, winter and Christmas vlogs are something I love through Ryland and Shane, I love these vlogs in this season
It's giving Vlogoween !!!!
“Today is all about eating and shopping and Halloween and Fall.  And should we get costumes for thr Alpacas…?” Shane 2023. I ADORE YOU GUYS SO MUCH!
I don't expect you to show us the babies BUTTTT I would absolutely LOVE if you included us on your new journey of parenthood and i'd LOVE to see all the cute things you do for the twins!!
Get your grass cut
Love this you guys actually make me happy
i can’t believe how close you guys are too having the babies! i literally remember watching you guys picking a surrogate like how?! so exciting! 🤍
vlogOWEEN
The bugs being on Oogie is perfect 🪲🐛
Aww no you didn’t get ✨Lewis✨
Macaroons are Coconut and chocolate... it's a different dessert
You need a Christmas tree at your new house so you can get a picture of your newborns in front of your pretty lit tree!!!!
A pullet is another word for a young female hen.
Shane is the human version of what happens in my brain all day lol so many thoughts, plans and ideas at once lol
Just do vlogmas in La but just do it small
Shane is to much sometimes
Poulet is chicken in French fyi
After the babies, are you guys going to be traveling still back n forth from homes?
RYLAND, your hair looks SO good 😍
im so excited for yall!!! ive been watching shanes videos since 2008! to see hes his family keep growing is so heart warming ! i can tell the love yall have for eachother and its amazing. ps. get ready ASAP not many twin moms will go full term ! i didnt have twins and my son came 2 months early !!!
The best of both worlds for Halloween and Christmas do the theme "A Nightmare Before Christmas"
“Its Sweatah Weathah!”
Xmas is ILLEGAL until November 🤮
Twins usually don’t go full term (40 weeks). What’s the plan if they come way earlier?
Shane is the CEO OF FALL
VLOG-A-WEEN!!! 🎥 🎃 🎄
Fall in Colorado this year is disappointing me it usually is cooler and has changing colors by this time😒
Im so excited for them cannot contain myself
LMAOOOO shane tapping you and saying overpriced is crazy
More Cheeto content please 💞 those two seconds at 22:11 aren't enough😞
I wouldn't mind a vlogtober, vlogoween fest instead of Christmas lol
A "poulette" is a cute word for a chicken in French :) We call chickens "poules" so "poulette" means "little chicken". We also use "poulette" as a cute word for a girl. So I think it fits perfectly the mood of the bakery ! Also edit : a kouing amann is a specialty from Brittany made from A LOT of butter and a LOT of sugar. (Kouing means cake and amann means butter in old Breton). Love from France !
If yo I send me your yarn I’ll make you anything you like!
Would theynot sell the display skelly? The shoos around me always sell their display items last
I work at Home Depot and we get the skeleton every year.
HALLOWEEN VLOGMAS PLSS❤❤😊
I wish I had giant skellys for my garden! I joined the fb group awhile ago but ive never seen them in the UK 💀
Why not do like a nightmare before Christmas inspired theme part Christmas part Halloween
Does Shane ever do manual labor😂
Love your videos also Shane and Ryland are going to be great parents love you both
Love Oogie Boogie he's my favorite also you could watch Nightmare Before Christmas if you want it's both it's Halloween and Christmas
VLOG-O-WEEN!!
1pm for a bakery is average closing time 😅
Happy Fall you all 🎃🎃 My baby boy is due Dec 10th. I have no idea what to do for Christmas either lol
VLOGAWEEN
Vlogoween!
I agree with Rylands take on incorporating the babies. They’re part of your life but they’re not the centre of your channel.
One of my neighbours has that huge 12ft skeleton I'm their yard and they bring it out every year. My 3 year old LIVES FOR IT it's her favorite thing on the block and she is so excited to see it every year. I def think it'll be worth it to add to your collection
Shane looks so good !! He’s going into dad mode. I love watching you guys grow !
Nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween movie!
Vlog-o-ween !!!!
Vlogaween
Do the nightmare before Christmas so it both Halloween and Christmas
nah sorry you guys need to go get more!! DO IT UP SHANE hahah
My favorite thing ever is pulling out all the Halloween or Christmas decor and remembering what you bought last year lol it's so exciting
😂 oh my gosh I just love you guys. So excited! FALL Y'ALL❤
VLOGOWEEN !!!
shane telling me he knows colleen hoover makes my whole year! Y’all need to read one of her books and vlog it.
You guys can get lights for the house that are remote controlled, so you can have them fall colored up until you leave for LA, and then switch them to Christmas colors for when you’re gone
👻 Happy Vlogoween!!! 🎃
Yalls baby boys are due 4 days after my baby boy is due 🥰🥰🥰!!!!!
I find this tasting part funny, because american cookies are big and chewy and in denmark if your cookie is chewy you did something wrong and it is not acceptable. The cookies are almost all  small and hard 😂
Also .. Shane we are okay with ! Get your lights boo !
Do vlogtober instead of vlogmas. :) Problem solved!
“We have work to do. GET OFF THE GROUND” lmaooo
Those giant skeletons are alwaysss sold out and impossible to find!  Ppl resell them for $500 😱😱 good luck !
Are you sure the grass makes Uno sick? Dogs typically eat grass to soothe an upset stomach
The Nightmare Before Christmas is a Halloween movie. It was released October 13th, 1993. And also confirmed by the director 😊
Oogie boogie man !! Love him the best part of the whole movie
#8 on Trending?
I'm surprised you guys are choosing to have your babies at the LA house, CO seems so much safer and homier and your family is there :,(
I’m only at the beginning but I’m cracking up at 8-1 being early. My one year old insists on getting up at 6:30 at the latest. In the future you’ll be upset that things aren’t open earlier. 😂
Sag babies! ♐️
Nothing makes me happier then these videos ❤
They are expiring the 12 foot skeleton!  Get it NOW!
Pleeeeaaaase do keep vlogging as parents. No need to show the babies faces but I do want that parenting content if and when you feel up for it ❤
😂 you are going to need that nursery ready soon. Babies come when they want to come.
love the part of the video where they adresses something
Nightmare before Christmas is good for Halloween and Christmas. Just sayin
“If we dont make it im calling Elon” 😂😂
Shane’s energy in this video is so me 😂
The caramel wasn’t what you expected?? Because it was custard you donut
VLOG-A-WEEN❣️ it’s right there you both for gobs sake. 😹 🎃 🌚✨
5:49 the fact that he’s trying to mention macaroni and cheese as an excuse to not say it the proper way is so funny 😂 as a pastry chef, a macaroon is a compleeeetely different thing to a French macaron and so what I’m trying to say is shane, you’re very wrong about the pronunciation 😂
Nightmare before christmas is painted on my fingernails
❤❤❤❤🎃🎃🎃🎃
No but we waited a long time for this have 2 see them 1 a month at least.
The 12ft skeleton is going to be discontinued this year so if you want him maybe try to buy the display !
Fun fact, dogs eating grass is okay and actually good for them! It contains enzymes that aid in digestion and improve gut health!
It's called Vlog-O-Ween and yes, you should do it!
the two toned lighting is SO cute!!!!
Go ahead and hire people to do lights in California, I’d say if you can spend the winter in California, have family come out and stay nearby or with y’all for Christmas (trust me you’ll need extra help haha) and then bring babies to Colorado March!
What r u guys talking about the baby suppose to be due January I even called the baby winter baby and Capricorn baby why r u guys saying December 😢😢😢😢😢😢 nooooo... What is happening? I wanted them a 2024 baby, new year and new life... Oh man ok but then again  an Xmas baby... Wow
Not even done watching this but ryland you so should have got the pumpkin archway!!!
VLOG-O-WEEN!! 👻🎃🖤
When you tap on Ryland and said overpriced I died 😂😂 ☠️
Y’all have got to shower and groom. It’s a mess. We can smell the video. Literally. Hygiene is important boys.
Shane’s 3 jacket changes before going to the store is SO RELATABLE 😂🤣 One is fine until it’s simply ✨NOT FINE✨ anymore ☠️
Why is this trending
VLOGWEEN!!!!!!!! Cmon guys!! 👻
I thought the 13 foot jack Skellington from Home Depot! The regular skeleton was pretty cool as well! And how have you guys never watched nightmare before Christmas!? Holy shit you guys have you been living under a rock? That movie has been around for 30 years!😂😂😂😂😂
Yessssss it’s finally fall time!!!! & y’all crack me up 😂😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️ love y’all decor!!!! 👻🎃
Rylands MANGLED that croissant
My Ryan can’t multitask either Shane, maybe it’s a Ryan thing 😂😂 can’t live with them and definitely can’t live without them! 🤣🩷
I'd take Vlogoween over Vlogmas any day lol
These are literally my favorite vlogs 💞
LOVE ORDINARY ADVENTURES
Poulette is the feminine way in French to spell chicken in English
Shane smelling the smoke pastries like he’s perfume shopping 😂
omgggg no Christmas shopping on Halloween this year😢 BUT YOU GUYS CAN GO LAST MIN BABY SHOPPING FOR CHRISTMAS OUTFITS !!!
Once again, here I am in my kitchen just grinning through this entire video 🩵
All the Boos on the island need sombreros and they can be the Three Amigos
What am I doing I have 2 toddlers and haven’t decorated shit 😂
Okay TRENDING 💛🥰
Calling Marshalls a discount store instead of just saying the name lol. I'm blasting the name when I find something good from there. But in all seriousness, I'll probably go buy that soap now lol
15:21 I feel asleep watching this last night so I came back to watch- did you edit something out? Or did I dream it!! 😳
Poulette means chicken in french ;)
Poulette is chicken in French lol
Gonna convince my husband I need that ghost dog
Fun fact Ryland, dogs actually eat grass when they feel sick. It helps them vomit. So the grass isnt making him sick, he is eating it because he is sick.
I can't wait for family videos with the babies 😭💙
halloweenmas pleseeee
Yess! Do vlogoween 🎃👻
Omg! My birthday is December 15th!!! ❤
Twins always come early
You should try get those customisable lights you had for your Christmas tree last year outside! So can change the colours depending on the season/holiday!
A pullet is another name for a female chicken that has not started laying. What a cute bakery and those pastries looked DELICIOUS! ❤
it bothers my brain how y’all say caramel
i live and breathe yalls vlog miss i look foawrd to it every year BUT yall are having a family family before fans ! love yall tell uno i said heyyy
December 15th!?! That’s my daughter's 2nd birthday!😭🎄
Vlogoween!!!
Ryland being the mom and yet being the one always wanting to do manual labor cracks me up, reminds me of my manic cleaning 😂😂😂 SO freaking cute, also excited to see what they do for vlogmas. The entire conversation was a whirlwind 😂🙈😂
Poulette is French, in English it means chicken, —> Chicken Cafe, hence the chickens everywhere. Also, the t isn’t pronounced so technically it’s pronounced “poo-leh” 😊
Poulet means chicken in french ❤
Yesss please do a VLOGAWEEN!!
I honestly love you guys so much . Your videos always make me laugh
Vlog-o-ween
I’ve heard those big skeletons are sold out early every year and that this is the last year they planned to make them
Where did you get that tiny dog ghost?!?
If they did Vlogmas in October they could call it Vlogoween
Ready to vlogween! 😊🎉
I can’t with Shane 😂 love you guys don’t ever stop filming!!
so nice to see real french pastries in America 😅 Kouign Amann is a speciality of Britanny. Please don’t pronounce the "t" in croissant haha🥐🇫🇷
Omg my next door neighbor has that big ass skeleton in their front yard and it scared the FUCK out of me last night lol
Yes to Vlogoween!! 🎃👻
in all fairness i thought that pastry had a ghost on the top, so kinda fall
‘Vlogoween’
I’m like you Shane, I want Christmas deco now! I actually keep a lot of it up all year, both Halloween and Christmas. I lovvvvvve Halloween, obviously 😂, but I also lovvvvvve Christmas! So I’m all for lights being up all year to be honest. 😂
Vlogoween! 👻
I’d debate that Nightmare Before Christmas is a Halloween movie !!!!! Hahaha
Twins normally never make it to full term, 90% of the time they’re early
Do Vlogoween!!🤩
I I miss seeing uno and honey andcheeto 😂
“Vlogaween” would be PERFECT!!!!
You can totally watch Nightmare Before Christmas at any time and i think it's both Halloween and christmas!
Ryland have you seen any tim.burton. cause that should be remedied immediately
As the owner of a 12 foot skeleton and mom of a baby boy – DO ITTTT!!! SO WORTH IT
Vlogoween
Do a Nightmare Before Christmas theme! It’s literally both holidays in one 😂 Spooky Christmas
"I'm going to oogie my pants" 😂
a Cruffin!
27:09 VlogWeen would be more appropriate than Halloween vlogmas..... right?  DO IT Halloween is my favorite holiday
Halloween bog mist
The kouign amann is a traditional thing from Brittany in France (my region). It is DELICIOUS!
You need the lights you leave up all year and can control the colors to match the season
If they are born on the 15th, they will be born on a full moon and their moon sign will be gemini or cancer depending on what time they are born, sun sign being capricorn ofc.
i’m so worried yall will disappear forever once yall have the babies!! which will break my heart
You guys trending is my absolute favorite thing of the day 🤍🤍🤍
Vlogoween
Who’s going to tell them that most bakeries close at 2pm (or earlier) 😂 I was laughing at how baffled they were with the hours because that’s so normal for most bakeries.
You two make me smile, i just love watching you both. You are going to be amazing parents ❤❤
Poulet is chicken in French.
Please vlog more;)
FALL VLOG 🎉
Yeah, we have the 12ft skeleton, 12 ft witch, 9ft werewolf, 15ft phantom and 8ft spider…outside. Inside, we have the 6ft Jack, Sally and Oogie! Love Halloween!
Aw❤ we’re gonna share a birthday ❤ Sagittarius babies
Loving this. Also, are you guys going to go somewhere haunted for a Halloween special again?? I LOVE when you guys do that!!! Crossing my fingers for it!
Vlogween!!!!
AAHHH IM SO EXCITED FOR FALL VLOGS AND THEN VLOGSMAS 🎶saving the world with rylands vlogmassssss🎶🎶🎶
Whoooo
The nightmare before Christmas is both a Halloween movie and a Christmas movie you guys should totally watch it!!!! You gotta watch more Disney movies so you guys are pro dads lol 🤍🧡🎃
I wish I had a friend like Ryland! ❤❤
i beg to differ nightmare before xmas can be watching in EITHER holiday
🎃
When posting babies, just keep in mind that they will likely see the videos when they grow up.  It’s important to show them in their best light and not post stuff that will embarrass them or make them feel bad.
You aren’t gonna find any of those 13 foot skeletons unless this was filmed months ago lol I tried 😢
You guys need Lewis from Target. So much cuter than the giant skeleton!
try taste testing a salad bar or an exotic fruit and THAT would be surprising content
Show them in their seats looking at thr Christmas tree
Blur their faces
Vlogoween!! 🎃
Can you both stop whatever it is youre doing and watch The Nightmare Before Christmas already. It's literally NOT just a Christmas movie, but a halloween movie too and its ICONIC. I love TNBC sosososo much, Tim Burton is a GOD.
As a new mom of ONE who lives away from me and my husband’s families, I strongly advise you guys to be close to family with those new babies! Utilize all the help you can.
Coming to Parker to visit friends in 2 weeks! They live 5 mins from you. See you in passing!
16:54 Why am I not surprised they're friends😂
I had to cone on here to say how fecking good shane is looking these days! Work it girl! I loved this video! You are doing amazing both of you. Love from the UK
I’m confused. When y’all left California y’all were excited saying stuff like you feel better in Colorado and California was too much and so forth but yet y’all keep going to California for like half the year.
Im going to oogie my pants 😂
Poulette is a young chicken in French. 😊
Vlogoween
My bday is 12/15! Hope your babies come happy and healthy!
I'm so excited for you both! You are going to be such great parents. Those babies are so lucky to have such fun, loving and outgoing parents. Yes Shane, I said outgoing lol
« Poulette » = chick in french 😅😂 Also What U had at the beginning is called a « sablé » and traditionnally made with a lot of butter and sugar   *Hi from a fellow French subscriber❤ love ur content
The nightmare before Christmas isn’t a Christmas movie! It’s a Halloween movie 🤓🎃
Ive got to be the only one that hates fall. 😅 someone else needs to join me in anti fall! P.s. poulet is chicken in french 😉 I think for the babies you could just not show their faces like many of these celebrities are doing. That way you can still show pictures and vlog as parents without exposing their identity.
Why are they leaving this beautiful family home for when the babies come?  The weather? I always pictured them in this house with the babies... Ya know? Theyre just SO happy here.
Your vlogs make me so happy!!❤ thank you for always sharing 😊
@ordinary adventures get s a shout out!
hallo-vlog!
You’re becoming a family now, you’re creating a family system and I find family systems to be important for us all. No matter the pair that’s raising their family because, it’s a family.   You two are the units that will hold each other, your home and your family together.   F*c the internet opinions, bc life is important and so is love. So is the conflict and the anger. Make sure to talk about things that make you uncomfortable, sad, scared and lonely. Because your lives will be melded together to help (two new lives) grow and become someone of their own. Maybe they’d also want to be an influencer, or maybe they’d like to be a doctor as a child only to realize they have no fucking idea what to do.   But you were there, and as parents you’ll either make this harder or easier for your child: either way it won’t matter because, we’ll all feel traumatized by our parents or see the ‘dark’ side of the family but they will always love you as parents and I’m only commenting this, because I’m assuming you guy’s have been thinking about your babies a lot.   But remember to hold yourselves and each other together, I never comment on videos because I know the comment section is so deep and there’s only so far everyone can read.   I haven’t watched either you or Shane for awhile because of my own life, but I dunno..   I guess I just wanted to say, you’re creating something together so don’t let anything sabotage it.   If you struggle with communication, start talking right now.   If you struggle to love, start loving right now  If you struggle to heal, talk about it and feel it right now. Don’t deny the reality of it.   But don’t let yourself become worrisome.   Worrying is impossible, but in a way worrying is what provokes someone to work on something.   You’ve helped Shane a lot, I find that to be beautiful. But SAME SHANE like whatever it is idc, same. But anyways,  🫶
HalloVlogMas
Vlogoween
I can’t believe the boys will be here in like 2 months!!! ❤😮😭🥹 so exciting!!!
I love you guys! But you need to mow your lawn! ❤😂
What about Fallmas 🍂🍁
I agree with Ryland on vlogmas lol. Do Xmas at the LA house, and give us the vlogs of all the decorating and if you do any gifting lol. And then maybe prefilm a "The Baby's are Here" video and use that to close out Vlogmas whenever it happens!
"IT'S FALL YALL"  Best intro ever❤❤❤❤
Hallovlogs ?
Shane looks absolutely disgusted when ryland is eating and saying macaron lol 😂
This is a wholesome video to watch! Especially after i had a sad day in October 1st. My two dwarf rabbits (Minnie & Stitch) have both passed away.
the vlogoween i didn't know i needed 🥲
That's gorgeous!! ♥ We don't have haloween where we live (yet). I would have loved it growing up, but now I'm okay because I don't like visitors lol
I love the two colors like that!! New tend y’all!!
Babies might be here on my birthday!!!!
If you want the 12 foot stuff at home Depot you need to start watching in July. Also skelly getting retired this year. Hes been out a few years now 😬
Omg I love your vlogs I die laughing and always can’t wait for your next one 😂😊❤
Le poulet means the chicken in French.  So I’m assuming that’s why they had a chicken theme.
*cries in someone who has to wake up at **4:30** every day* 😭
My due date is Dec 15th ! Having this pregnancy journey with you all is so cool!
My birthday is on December 15!!! 🎉❤
Cuz you're going to want to share your babies with us cuz we love you guys and we want to celebrate with you a picture of them like when there born.   Just once for now & then when they get a little older yall can snap another picture for us. Then  then when they are a little older  you can snap another picture. One a year or something. There is nothing wrong with that.❤ we've been going along with you guys on your journey. Love yall and just so happy your dreams are becoming a reality!💯💞🦋☝🙌🙏
LOL AT SHANE'S FACE as he realizes there are two cameras
Vlog-O-Ween
shane is so lazy
Vlogtober
I agree with Shane. Vlogmas starts NOW.
Poulette is chicken in french😂
I’m so excited for your babies! It’s coming so soon!   It took me like 5 mins to pronounce “macaroni “ correctly after that lmaoooo
I gagged when said he knew Colleen, what I’d give to have a conversation with that women!
If you know Zoella, UK YouTuber, since she will deliver her baby in December, she made a Vlogust (VlogMas in August) as she could not do it in December.
I had a stuffed animal made out of alpaca fur you should make the boys one 🥰
I just really lovee and live for his vlogs! Never stop doing it ❤
A twitch streamer I watch showed her son until he was about 9-10 months old as his features were really developing for him to be recognizable. Now her and her wife will post pictures but they'll just put a little emoji over his face for his privacy/protection. Just a thought!
if you start vlogmas now you can do two episodes a week making 25 episodes around Christmas. (just putting this out there) . 19:55 Also that's cool that you watch pewdiepie. From the beginning, the first three channels I subscribed too was Shane Dawson, Pewdiepie, and The Holy Trinity (Grace, Hannah, & Mamrie) , I still watch all today.
27:11   Vloggoween  🤔 HallowVlogs  😁  Wish i had one of those depots in the area! that's like a small wonderland
Parker and Jet is more important than anything else in your every decorating trust that because Ryland you can't help yourself you want to celebrate so you'll be decorating while you're celebrating the babies
I think the purple and orange lights are super cute! ❤
Nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween AND Christmas movie 😂 but ryland kills me not knowing anything about it
They say winter babies raised in actual winter have stronger immune systems 🤷🏼‍♀️
"We can't bring out the Gingerbread Woman?" 🥺
Maybe call it VLOGOWEEN?
Y'all should get the lights that you can change with an app and you can change the theme whenever you want! They're so cool!
VLOG-O-WEEN 🧡🧡🧡🤎🤍
So proud of Shane for not overreacting this time while Ryland is eating. 😊   PS- there better be a VLOGMAS! Don’t ruin Christmas!
Ryland, poulette or poulet is French for chicken. So you were correct about the name of the bakery being something about chickens.😊
Love your Vlog, you guys crack me up!!!
You should call it Vlogoween instead of vlogmas
Vlog-oween?
Poulet means chicken in French.
I needed this ❤❤❤❤❤
Lol it’s a bakery they don’t just open when they want , their workers are probably there at 4 am to bake fresh stuff lol  so they’ve already been there 8 or 9 hours . Maybe wake up at a normal human hour. Your unemployment is showing
Watching Shane’s face silently react when Ryland ripped apart / aesthetically destroyed that croissant muffin thing with the vanilla frosting or a filling inside… Had me giggling the whole way home from driving my daughter to school this morning… I love you guys so much🤗🤗🤗
Halloween vlogmas "hocus pocmas "
You can get the colour changing smart lights that you control through your phones & put them up now, use halloween colours then use them with Christmas colours later!
Y’all have to go to a haunted house!
23:34 it’s a BOOQUET! 🌚
I’m down with Christmas already. 😜♥️
okay, her me out....... VlogOween !
#Vlogween👿👻😈
Happy boomas 🎃
"Poulette" is a cute name you can give to a lady chicken. You can refer to a girl also with "poulette" in the same way you would use the term "chick"
That's a French bakery. That's how chicken is spelled in French
No wonder Americans are in general a little heavier than other nations, there is so much good food! Norway is super boring!
Give us Vlogoween!
I live in Norway and I keep dreaming about this thing I got at 89 degree cafe, called milk pudding and that was HEAVEN! I wish I could make it at home. They tasted like HEAVEN! :D
NO YOU NEEEEEDDDD TO GET LEWIS FROM TARGET!!!!!
The wrong google time is something the store needs to update in their Google MyBusiness manager. Just incase they see this and dont know ;)
Shane makes the vlog
Vlogaween! It should definitely be a thing.
WE WANT VLOGMASS!!!!!PLEASSEEEEEEEEEEE
Shane! You look incredible. go you!!
Vlogoween

Hey french girl here 🇨🇵 "une poulette" is a chick  😊
Scarecrow name…. Scare-let Johansson

Shane is alwas on point with his review.
Hear me out... VLOGOWEEN !? 👻
Vlogoween!
I bet ryland told Shane “google said 1” so they would actually get there on time lol😂😅
Halowvlog just an idea for a vlog  Am loving this video 😍
Ryland and Shane are both having "dad glow ups" like omg yall looking great!
Nightmare before christmas IS a halloween movie and i will die on this hill
The “are you fucking kidding me..GO” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Macaroons are a Jewish sweet treat made out of coconuts. Macarons come from France.
12:07 🤣
In Wales we call the croissant muffin a cruffin!
Shane skinny queen🔥🔥🔥
I just thought of this but you could name your scarecrow Russel Crow now that's funny.
Happy Spooktober Y’all!   I always wanted people to do “vlogmas” as halloween!
poulette in french means little chicken like here in some cities in France it’s usually used as a cute nickname lol !  update : kouign amann is a speciality in Bretagne in France ! I think the bakery is highly inspired by french pastries and that’s maybe why they called poulette since the representation of France is a coq.
Need a hair care routine for Roland's hair journey
Vlogoween!!
You're*
NAME THE SCARECROW SANTA CLAUS 🎅🏼🍂❤️❤️!!!
my baby is due November 6th for a planned c section 💙 I'm having a boy too ❤️ I cant wait, but I'm so scared, I have so much to get ahha #stressedbutexcited x
I'd say... don't post the babies, take photos of them as newborns and post them a few months later when they don't look like that anymore. From babies and toddlers they may be recognisable.
Vlogoween!!
I wish you all the best with the babies. Having twins is HARD. So think about maybe having something ready to back you up when you are feeling burned out and sleep deprived. 🤍🤍
In my opinion the little dog w a pumpkin bucket should be year round next to Boo. Boo needs a friend :) ps. Love you guys! Been watching for years!❤
Vlogaween
Shane and Rylan’s have suck Scott Disick vibes 😂
😂 you gon be waking up alot earlier than 12 once those babies are home 😂
Happy Fall Y'all! Did you know that The Stanley Hotel has magic shows and a theatrical seance? I booked my daughter and I for a Halloween night 13 Seance event, I'm so excited! Last Halloween night, we went attended a magic show about possessed objects at the hotel. It was REALLY amazing and one of the coolest & creepiest nights I've experienced, especially driving down that mountain in pitch blackness (no light, no moon) at midnight! I can't wait for Halloween night! I decked out my house in September which was hard for me to wait for, I was ready August 1st. I hope you guys get to do all the fun Autumn things like a corn maze, haunted hayride, and such! I might even go on one of the walking ghost tours in Denver! Also, my daughter loves that Mountain Dew Baja Blast shirt, lol... now she wants one!
The way Ryland pronounced Macaroni 3 different ways in conversation
Just came to compliment Shane’s jacket in the thumbnail. U look so cute boo. Happy spooky month! 🧡
Y’all could do VLOGOWEEN 🧡🎃👻
If you really don't like having not having the same color lights you could simply buy another set of each color and then wrap orange with purple & the purple with the orange that way you have both colors on each rail!
Nightmare before Christmas is both a Christmas and Halloween movie
Poulet means chicken in French ryland!
Would love an early vlog!! I can't believe the babies will be here so soon! Love you both! ❤😊❤
Ok WAIT.. this video made me first so happy, but then so sad!!! No vlogmas??? What 😭😭😭 I’m SO UPSET!! I could cry!! Me and my family watch your vlogmas every year, it’s our tradition… we love it sooooo much ❤ is there any way you could make it happen?? ( pre film / ship the Christmas stuf to ca?) or at least build  the Christmas village? 😭😭😭 this is the worst news ever !! Listen, picture your new born babies under the Christmas tree, surrounded bij sparkly decor… that would be everything- just saying 😁🙏🏼💖
Vlogoween!!!! 🎃🎃🎃yes do it ❤
Shane looks like a babygirl in this video
You should Vlog-O-Ween.....
Please track your journey of being dads in vlogs And showing the babies!!! As a follower of Shane for years and ryland since he came in your life we as a fan base are growing with you! We need to see the journey girlies!!!! #boydads!
I’m so obsessed!!! Got me inspired to do my decorations too ❤️❤️🎃
I think Shane would actually love 'Nightmare before Christmas'
Is this the guy who “thought like a ped0”? And called babies “sexy”?
Please do Vlogoween!
Halloween + vlogmas = vlogoween 🎉🎉😂
VLOGWEEN YASSS 😂💚💛🧡❤️
Nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween movie!! You have to watch it this season
The longest I’ve ever seen Rylands hair and I don’t want him to ever cute his hair looks great and definitely giving dad/ parents vibes.
5:43 it’s mAcaron it’s French babes 😂😅
Per baby anonymity: you guys can do it the Casey Niestat way - showing their faces until they're at the age they can be recognized (toddler age)
You can do spooky season vlogs! Maybe 13 days to Halloween, since vlogmas will be difficult to do
Ah shane, my fellow cancer 😅 always stressing when we're late and everyone's LAGGING
Ryland plz upload more I love these videos
Poulet is French for chicken
Omg watch the nightmare before christmas already. It's so good.
NBC is absolutely a Halloween movie too! We watch it for both Halloween & Christmas!
tell shane to put a damn ring on his finger RIGHT NOW i just noticed rylands the only one wearing a ring🥺
Having watched Shane as I was growing up, it’s so funny to clearly see Ryland being “the man” in the relationship😂 but I feel like he takes such good care of Shane
He’s a… fiesta? 🤨😏
“This is the shed of honesty”
Shane and Ryland are so comical I love how excited Shane gets!
VLOG-OWEEN! 💀👻🎃
SHANE SAY IT WITH ME   Nightmare before Christmas is BOTH a Halloween movie AND a Christmas movie   K thanks ily 🥰🤭
In the YouTube videos from Tom Daley and his family, they never show their sons faces.  But you are able to hear them talking, and see them interact with each other..I think thats a very good decision.😊
I need to y’all stay together forever, my relationship depends on it! She said & I quote “if they get divorced, I won’t believe in love anymore”.. so yeah please stay together!, thank you 🙏🏽
Omgggg  All Hallows Vlogmas 😁🤗 .... or something like that! Oh I get so excited when y'all post a new video,  you two are my absolute favorite ❤
You have to do Christmas decor in LA! For Babies first Christmas🎄
Didn’t you guys buy rylands parents the giant skeleton years ago ?

It’s Boologmas 👻🎃
Why was there Among us sound track in the video? 😂
So, here's a thought...start a new YT trend "Vlog-o-weenie".  😮😊.   Just a thought. ❤.   OK, currently watching y'all shopping at Home Depot.  I need to clarify, I posted my "Vlog-o-weenie" idea, before Ryland asked if shane wanted to do a Halloween vlogmiss......  Just saying... 😜  Love the porch, yes the purple & orange lites look great.....
You guys definitely should do vlogoween
I like this video, i just wish it wasn't click bate. Like it's cringe. You can stand on your own on YT ❤ just call it IT'S Fall ya'll and keep it moving.  There's no need for some super dramatic title. Keep it honest and we'll keep watching ❤
I'm 29 weeks pregnant and while I'm thankful and feel very blessed that I'm able to conceive and carry a child, I am jealous that Shane and Ryland are going to have babies and they aren't getting heartburn or being kicked in the bladder 😂
A pullout is a chicken
I cant stop looking at rylands hair its gorgeous his gorgeous ❤ 4:39
Awww ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I’m having my little boy on Dec 21 🥰

Ok I’m like getting happy tears cause it’s getting closer and closer to the babies and I’m so happy for you two!🥲I love this time of year, it’s spooky season!👻 I love you both so much Shane and Ryland, hope you know!! Thank you for making my life more joyful for many years.❤I would love to see Halloween videos!!🎃

I've been watching you all from day one! Bring me so much joy 😊 Would you support another couple  having babies? Fund fertility treatments?? We've been trying for two years now please help?🙏🏻💚✨
RIP croissant
You can call it vlogoween!
STOP SAYING DECOR!!!! If you can't say 'decorations' then just how lazy are you?!?!
“I’m so happy for you” 😂😂😂😂😂 Took me out.
These vlogs seriously make my whole week. You two together are such a vibe. 😭❤️😂
I'm so happy you're both gay, lol!! It's definitely a roller-coaster 😂
Poulet is french for chicken 😂
Next time you’re in Washington to see your surrogate go to Left Bank Pastry in Olympia and get THEIR Kouign Amann…it will change your life it’s so buttery and sweet and salty and perfect.
Rylan lookin so handsome with the longer hair wow
Ryland looks great with his long hair and facial hair. His whole aesthetic is working for him. He looks so grown up and handsome. Looks like he's really come into his own and is living his best life.
Ugh... I hate people who can't say 'caramel' correctly!!!! 😡
Poulette is Chicken in French.
Vlog-o-ween…. I’m here for it 🎃
Macrons are only hard if they're bordering on being stale  Macron's are technically cakey
It’s French for chicken. Lol
Shane guuuurrrl you gotta start getting used to an early rise and being ready for the day with twins on the way!!! and Ryland hunni practice those multitasking skills, you going to need them! :P
i fucking adore both of you

I sincerely hope you realized that your “waking up at 12” days will be over soon - for, like the next fifteen years or so…
Vlogmas-Christmas Vlog-o-ween Halloween
Vlogoween!!!🎃🎃
Also, I know you’re looking forward to the nursery, but your first months will be spent in your room/living room. Promise lol
Y’all missed out. You should’ve done the whole house as Nightmare Before Christmas. Then it works from fall to Christmas lol.
“Woke up at 1” wait till the babies are up at 4 am😂😂
Awww Max and Jet being December babies 🥰🥰 12/14 here 🥰🥰
HOW HAVE THEY NOT SEEN A NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS ITS THE PERFECT HALLOWEEN CHRISTMAS MOVIE
I trust Shane with his reviews
VLOG + HALLOWEEN = VLOGOWEEN😻
My birthday is December 18th, wack if the lil ones are born same day!
Macaroon is an entirely different thing, Shane. It’s not a matter of pronunciation. If you call that a macaroon, you’re just blatantly wrong.
🧌👽☠️⛓️⚰️🎃🎭💀👿👺🧌👹♀️🎃 HAPPY HALLOWEEN 👻🎃👻🎃👻🎃
Everyone on here will go nuts if you dont show us the babies.😂😂. I like what Ryland said. Id make videos centered around Shalane and Ryland dealing with all the ups and downs of parenthood. Center the videos around you guys but include the babies at certain times. That way it wont be centered around the babies but you guys.
THEY HAVNT SEEN NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS?!  SHANE..........
You guys are killin ittt you look the best you’ve ever looked I’m not sure if it’s just your happy energy but it’s captivating
Soo disagree with Shane. Nightmare Before Christmas is just as much a Halloween movie!!
17:10 “I’m not judging sweetie I’m taking notes”💅🏼😋   Love you Shane and Ryland! So happy for you both, going to be amazing dads💙🩵
I can't believe the babies are almost done cooking😬
VLOGOWEEN 🧡🧡🧡🧡🎃🎃🎃🎃 I’m born on Halloween this would be amazing
The fact that you haven’t seen The Nightmare Before Christmas is a travesty 😫
Spookmas!!!
Opulent means chicken in French. It’s pronounced like poolay
Vlogween!!!
My sister has the 12ft skeleton from Home Depot. It’s way to big to me.  🤷🏼‍♀️
You guys can do Vlog-aween!!! 🎃👻 🍂
thank you for spotlighting a local Parker business!!!!!!! As someone who was born and raised there, I appreciate that a lot
VLOGOWEEN !!! 👻🍁🍂🍃👻
I love the two colors
Kouign-Amann is my favorite pastry of all time!!!
Thank you. I am in organ failure and severe sepsis. At home doing comfort care. Never imagined to be 24 like this. You guys helped make it disappear
I liveee for these vlogs 🧡
You guys should record ur sons (if you want) when they’re babies but when they’re getting older like 2 years or something u should cover their faces
They have them at Joann’s for $200 😳
I hope you do a baby shower blog
@Ryland Vlogs Girl i saw as Riley was Outside eating Grass!!!! Please Ryland you should bring him to the Vet. and see wich Minerals he needs because Dogs eating Grass is a sign! ❤ Love you guys
i neeeed to know where you got the little dog on your island
This is my favorite video's with you guys,fall/Halloween and best of All Christmas.. ever since you moved to Colorado I've seen a whole new side of shane and You to but mostly shane,Its great to have my happy bitch back😊❤
Vlog-O-Ween
NO VLOGMAS UNTIL THE MONTH OF HALLOWEEN IS OVER 😭😂 i’m definitely biased because halloween is my favorite and i celebrate year round, but still 😂 WE NEED VLOGWEEN
Why can't you have the babies in Colorado? Just wondering ❤😊
HAPPY 🍂🍁 FALL RYLAND AND SHANE,  ALSO FUR BABIES 😍😸❤️🐕
How has Shane never watched Nightmare Before Christmas!?!?!  I'm shook.
Vlogo-ween
Don’t come for me!  But for all the non parents out here please don’t turn all your content into babies 😬
HallowVlog? Vlogoween?
17:15
Am I the only one who sad and frustrated that they haven’t just committed to moving to CO and they’re having their babies in LA?!? Ugh…
If y’all don’t watch nightmare before Christmas this year ima hold it against you guys 🙄🙄🙄🤣🤣 everytime you guys talk about it and say you’ve never seen it over the years it makes me depressed lmao
The tap tap tap “overpriced” 😂😂😂
vlogoween?
You both randomly look so grown up lmao not like, older at all, but more dad-like I think it’s the lack of hair cuts 🤔
Vlogtober would be a good name 😁
Bro parenthood will definitely break you guys………….. the way yall act there absolutely no way you’re ready for infants
The cake shop prob starts their day at 3am to make all the amazing creations, so closing at 1 or 2pm is still likely a 12 hour day❤
what is the reason you want to be in california? Rylands family is there and you’re already there! A lot of babies are born in cold climates!❤️❤️ it doesn’t effect them as much as you think❤️❤️
Poulet is chicken in French so that's why there was chicken decor.   "poo-let" 😄
Can we take a moment at 11:00.  Ryan gives the bigger piece to shane🥹 so cute
Shane is the ultimate passenger princess
It seems like yall just announced yall were having babies and they are about to be here omg🤯😁❤ to say I'm excited for yall is an understatement lol.  I started following Shane 6 years ish ago then found your channel and love watching yall! Yall definitely deserve to be blessed with two beautiful babies❤ I would love to follow the journey of yall being new parents 😊
Do a vlog-mas but call it  vlog-oween 🎃 👻
Do nightmare before christmas!!
You need some goats to get rid of all the weeds around the barn.
Call it vlog-o-ween! 🎃❤️
Oooo I have the best name if you do vlogmas for Halloween  vlog 'o' ween
The only vlog channel I like the video before I even watch it. 🫶🏼
Shane leaving the house with his bag and water and everything he needs is major mom vibes
PLEASE WE NEED A VLOGOWEEN
To answer your question about the word poulette, it is the French word/terminology for a young female chicken/hen.
Ryland!! I got my skeleton in June… they start selling them early in the year and they always sell out quick for the last couple years so you always have to be in the look out …
Vlog-ó-ween 🎃 > Vlogmas ❄️
Ryland certainly has an eye for interior AND exterior design😍
“Vlogs Hollow” instead of Vlogmas
I would DIEEEEE for a Vlogoween !!!! 👻🎃🕸️
You guys could do a fall-hall-mas
I love you guys so much !!! ya'll make my day really !! you guys are so real and funny... i cant !! cant wait to see you both as dad's OMG !! much love from Puerto Rico <3
I feel this with Christmas decor… I’m due early jan and I love making winter wonderland but this year is def not gonna be a wonderland lol
You should go to Spirit Halloween. Pop up Halloween store that is everything Halloween 🤗
Shane saying the custard was too custard-y lol😂
Shane is going to FUCKING hate not being able to wake up at noon after the babies come lol. I was a night owl too. WAS
When you guys are living in the California house, who takes care of the alpacas? Ive always been curious! Love you guys ❤❤
Happy Vlogween!!!
Im ready for Vlogween 👻
First of all  Ryland is such a dad alreadyb😂 Second,  I love the way Shane acted in the car when Ryland was eating that macaroon 😂 "awe. Look at you" was so cute
Instead of vlogmas it will be vlogween!
We NEED MORE HALLOVLOGS !!! 🕸️❤
Exactly Shane! Nightmare before Christmas is a Christmas movie!!
It's pronounced "poo leh", which is French for chicken.
Omg Shae if your seeing this.. pease go look for he twerking puppy toy . P.s.. you'll fal in love with it
Lights on the Colorado house look great and are seen from the street but so expensive. I suggest just putting the rope white lights on the fence now and keeping them through Christmas.
A real French macaron should not be that big.
11:39 shane has armpit hair??? I would never of imagined 😮
Vlogoween!!
Vlog-o-ween!! 🦇🎃👻🌙✨️
Heart my shiit ryland!!!! Please 🙏
im sorry, but can y'all pls just  move fully to Colorado
Lol he never finished counting to 10 though 😂😂

Thank you for all your hard work on these videos you, Shane, and Lizzi post ❤
OMG!! I’m going to miss all the Christmas decor and the new Santa Village 😫

Poulet is French for chicken. And is pronounced poolay, not poolette.❤

8:22 look at you ryland getting thicker ❤ witt yo buhdonkey donk!!❤❤❤👑 and shane looking slimer asfk yall looking good!!!!!!🎉
There's no way you said the nightmare before christmas is just a christmas movie it's BOTH
Documenting the joys and stresses of being parents will be helpful to others. There’s always healthy boundaries.
Y’all can call it vlogoween idk if someone said it already but it goes good!
Please continue vlogoween.
Vlogoween instead of Halloween vlogmas. 😍
How have you never seen the nightmare before Christmas!?!?🤦‍♀️ it's a Halloween & a Xmas movie🤗perfect for both holidays❤️💚🧡🎃
You’re gonna have your babies in LA when all your family is in Colorado?? That’s a risky decision lol
Nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween and Christmas movie!!!! Once it hits November u can watch it till January idc wat anyone says
Volgoween
Vlog-Oween
Vlog-o-ween! 🎃
Halloween christmas combined sounds like a good idea then a more chill Christmas in cali
Ryland works so hard ❤
Happy Vlogmas Baby!!!!
Poulet means chicken in french. Pronounced (poo-lay)
I’m late but I feel like Halloween for October with decorating, halloween movies, spooky/haunted houses, etc and then Vlogmas for November of decorating, putting up lights, getting ready for the babies, etc would be awesome.
please let me buy some alpaca yarn from you guys ❤❤❤❤❤
Poulet is chicken in French
Make a Halloween village for the pool table this year, or next. You were all about the Christmas village, but a Halloween one would be awesome. I have a Christmas village scene I did last year. A Christmas tree farm (cut down yourself) with a greenhouse, and we are planning on doing a Halloween village scene. We just have a little dresser surface we do ours on, so we don't do a whole village. I want to do a creepy house in a cemetery (like the groundskeepers house), with a spooky entrance, with headstones everywhere with skeleton arms popping out, and maybe a mausoleum.
okay there's something so casual but completely seamless and perfect about how ryland decorates your home. househusband goals.
my birthday's december 15th😭🖤
Shane, I love you, but it's Spooky Season! Right now it's time to enjoy the creepy. Screw Christmas. The second Halloween is over you can move on to THANKSGIVING! :P
Y’all are going to be the best dads! Has Shane thought about trying to get up earlier each day to acclimate himself to early feedings? Ha!
Poulette (fem) or Poulet (masc). Now just repeat after me chicken. And pronounce that cookie any way you please it doesn't matter it's a friggin cookie.
Just thinking 😂that you guys are not going to have all this energy after babies are born. Also Shane your gonna have to get up with Rylanevery morning .The dogs will be up & Rylan can’t fed & change 2 babies at the same time. Also your both going to be up a couple of times for the night feedings. Your not going to believe how busy & exhausted your both going to be .😅 Just wanted to warn you 😊
You HAVE to watch nightmare before Christmas. You would love it Shane.
I’ve never wanted a plate of deserts so much in all my life 🧁
Love the different lights. ❤ looks amazing. I hope you show the babies at least once. But, I understand.
The 13ft skeletons were cool 2 years ago when no one had them really. Now, everyone does. They would look great at your place though. I'm just starting the video, so idk if you get them or not yet.
Shane not being into Halloween is so weird & disappointing. What horror enthusiast wants to skip Halloween & go straight to Xmas?! Love you but LAME! 😆👎🏻🎃
The two genders: Cowboy and Fiesta
Halloween vlogmas is a vlog-o-ween, you're welcome.
The bakery items didn’t look tasty 😂
Never trust Google for store hours they're 99.999% wrong. Every place I've gone.
you guys are such a beautiful couple. i have been watching for years and this relationship is just everything🎀🎀💗💗
❤❤❤
[Scarecrow looks like he has been out in the rain too long. His colors are sun faded. Dreary. I hope he holds out through Halloween before he dies.]
VLOGOWEEN!!!!!! <3
You could cover the Halloween decor in Christmas spirit! Santa hats, light and all.
I had to pause to comment on this...HOW HAVE YALL NEVER SEEN NIGHTMARE BEFORE XMAS? Tim Burton is the best and that movie is THE MOST ICONIC! I'm positive this won't be the only comment about it but damn! Watch it! And it's a Halloween/Xmas movie. Appropriate year round babes!❤❤❤❤
What about Vlog-o-ween?
Vlogoween
My depression's been really bad, thank you for making fall feel like fall 🧡🎃
Hey, I'm about to work on a new channel  Thank you and your team for inspiring me over the years. My personalities all appreciate your videos. About to watch one with Katie Morton. Just wanted to say  hi, with dark intentions. Happy Halloween! 😊👻🎃
Poulette is the cute nickname for a female chicken in french. And it can be used the same way as "chick" in english to refer to your girlfriend and whatnot. But it is  more like a joke. Also, it is an uncommon french family name which could be the name of the bakery owner!
your halloween vlog can be called vlogoween!!! ❤
VLOGOWEEN!!!!! yes girl
Awww I really hope you guys do vlogmas!!! I always love watching those videos and Morgan’s
I think Poulette means chick..so the cookie jars make sense 🤷‍♀️  Btw..I've never related more to shane then shane before coffee
I have a feeling dec 6th is the date because that’s my birthday! 🤞🏽🥰 I can’t wait to see how y’all are like dads!  Also shane your going to be forced to be a morning person once the boys are here! Trust me! I have a almost 3 year old boy 😅🫶🏽
I love the two different colors, im steaking that.
VLOG-O-WEEN
Ryland.  Get your own channel.  Your adhd husband runs your vlog. I'm adhd. He has his. Have yours.
i’ve been waiting for a new video!! 🤭🤭
You guys really need to get some ghosts from york ghost merchant's! They are soo cute!
18:49 Here in the Philippines, Christmas starts on September 😂😂 you'll see a lot of Christmas related things here starting from September 😂😂
Hey I have my Halloween tree up now and it's gonna be my Christmas tree as well. I celebrate multiple versions on Halloween 🎃 🤪 😌
No Vlogmas this year? NOOOOOOOOOOOO! (I guess we'll have to make do with a Vlogween.) And why must you stay in L.A for so long? I love your life in Colorado so much and I hate L.A 😅 You both better figure something out for Christmas or there will be hell to pay, your Vlogmas was the highlight of Christmas for the last two years.
Twin mom here... Those first 3 months are exhausting, I do not expect any sort of regular vlog schedule during the first year of their lives.
Nightmare before Christmas is not a Christmas movie 😭😭😭😭
You need a Spookytown...LOL
LOVE!!!!
Yes plz vlogmas in November!!! Love it!!!! Love your vids
[ Ryland, I love banana cream pie and real banana flips. It's really getting dark outside there in CO so fast now.]
Omg we’re not going to see you guys be parents? I can’t not see that.
Big brother live feeds pull rank. Shirtless Matt. It'd distract anyone. Even lesbian Izzy😂
Vlogween
When we having a slumber party in the barn!!
cronut!!!
Halloween Vlogmas = Vlog-o-ween
Me being triggered cuz ryland cant pronounce CarAmel correctly!!! Smh
Shane is good looking.
Halloween vlogmas is vlogoween!! 🎃👻🦇 & I'm so here for y'all doing that
FALLMAS.
Do a VLOG-O-WEEN! 🧡🖤🎃
Haha Ryland talking about “Poulet” and chickens I immediately thought, Ryland girl, Poulet is French for chicken, come on you know this.. but then I remembered he’s American haha French is not forced upon them. Sorry girl, my judgmental Canadian ass came through too fast 😂
Finally October!! That mean's Halloween and that also mean's holidays anddd that also means babies are almost here!!! ♥️♥️🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻... I absolutely love this time of the year cus i love ur guys videos even more ♥️🫶🏻🥹
Skip the Christmas stuff, we would be happy to see you getting ready for the babies.
Can’t wait for y’all’s little ones, their birthday is the day before mine❤🥹❤️
I’m sorry, but the laziness
Yes! Big brother live feed ❤ I love BB
Those giant skeletons have a choke hold on us middle aged people! I have several neighbors that have them.
Me and Shane are one bring on the Christmas decor babes 😂😂
😱 WATCH Nightmare Before Christmas for both Halloween and Christmas!
How DARE Shane. A Nightmare Before Christmas is BOTH a Halloween and Christmas movie!!! xD
Lolololollooolllll the black hole! I can’t - it’s hilarious and I love it!
You can truly see the happiness in Shane’s eyes. You will be great parents ♥️🥺
i love the two tone!!
Not to be *that* guy, but macaron & macaroon are 2 different things. Macaroon is almond/coconut kinda things. Like a cookie with coconut shredded on it
Just no
27:11 vlogoweeen
I find it hilarious how Ryland is so much gayer than shane but so much more masculine😅😅😅
yall could do a VLOGOWEEN!!
Vlog name.  Hallows Eve Vlogs.
Vlog o ween! That would be so cool to see. Especially since you guys will have your hands full with two beautiful babies in December.
SPOOK-MAS!!!!
Shane gets so excited 😅So much fun, how sweet Shane I love your decorating as well❤
VLOGAWEEN?!
100% ok with you guys starting Christmas videos now. (Especially considering I just bought decorations yesterday 🤣) 🎄💚❤️
It’s crazy that things for Halloween sell out before October!!!
Baby pics are ok I think as they will change so much.When they are old enough they can decide for themselves.
Thank you, I needed this!!!
Do vlosss nowww
I SAY SO CRIMASS NOW LOL
I was born December 8th. My first Christmas, my parents didn’t plan to decorate or get me anything. Then they felt guilty, so on Christmas Eve, they went out and got all the stuff. Although I don’t remember that holiday, it’s still special to know that my parents made my first Christmas one worth celebrating❤️💚
Happy Vlogaween!!!!
I live through you guys❤ thank you I love you❤
Shane, you’re about to have twin babies. Enjoy this now because… 👀
Vlog-o-ween!!!
14:26 I’m so glad to see my cats aren’t the only ones to lay on and sleep on the cardboard scratch pad. 😂
❤I'm a Taurus too Ryland and I love to decorate also!!!!You did an amazing job.Bravo.🎉And Shane is such a great partner😊 So sweet....
Happy vlogoween !!!👻🎃
VOLGOWEEN, please!! 🎃🕸️🍂👻
VLOGWEEN!
VLOGWEEN! Im here for it!!!
Ryland.. You totally missed the moment to say Vlogoween 😂 please do it if we're going to miss vlogmas ❤
Ryland with the long hair looks like a gay Ashton Kutcher no hate.
I honestly almost cried when u said you weren’t doing vlogmas in Colorado. I’ve watched the past 2 vlogmases in Colorado. It’s literally my happiness.
“I might barf if we pulled out Christmas” hahah ryland😅
We need Halloween vlogs ! I’m so sad we won’t be getting Christmas vlogs in Colorado 😢❤
I’m coming to see my son in Westminster in less than two weeks! Now I have to swing by that bakery when I’m there!
At a time where a lot of YouTubers have slowed down on content & videos and the era of YouTube started to fade away… you and shane have created so much good content between MULTIPLE CHANNELS AND PODCASTS! For those of us who are still here and love the og YouTube- we thank you so much
Hollowthanksmas vlog
the shed of honesty 😂😂
Where’s honey and uno
VLOGWEEN🎃👻!

My depression is cured whenever there’s a vlog of yours, Shane’s podcast or a Shane video. Love you both 🥹❤️
How about Vlogoween? 👻
poulet is chicken in French
I am always ready for Christmas! My favorite holiday and also my daughter's birthday. My baby is turning 18!! So excited for you guys to experience being parents, it truly is amazing and goes by so dang fast.
The way Shane looked at Ryland while he was eating the macaron was so loving ❤.. it warmed my heart.
I've been watching you guys for years love your videos my due date is Dec 14th !!!! I'm so excited for you guys it's coming up so fast❤️❤️

I love how you said nightmare before Christmas is a Christmas movie but oogie boogie bash happens at Disney for Halloween lol ❤ I watch it both holidays !! Totally watch it for Halloween!! ❤❤❤ also you guys will wanna decorate for Christmas because it’s the boys first Christmas and you’ll want it to be special ❤ you guys are seriously adorable! I love the decor!

Poulet = Chicken 🐓 but French
Me having all the Home Depot Giants makes me sooooo happy that you started looking for him then I remembered he is hard to get ❤️❤️❤️❤️ there is facebook groups of people that decorate them all year long!!!
Mommy here !!!! U won’t have time for Christmas!!!! Every two hours to feed two babies I say relax and enjoy them when they r small skip Christmas
Poulette is french for young chicken. Also my son's birthday is December 16th! So exciting :)
I’ve been binge watching all your vlogs today! So happy for a new one 🥰
I would love to clean your house! The kitchen window with the morning☀ ☀ coming in! Beautiful!
Vlogoween🎃👻
In prep for Max and jett make sure you have a pediatrician before they are born. Congrats!!
Ooookay! We need a poll!  Is Nightmare Before Christmas a Halloween movie or a Christmas movie?? I say Halloween 🎃
love y’all ❤😂
Name it vlogoween for Halloween Vlogmas
Started this video earlier today. Had to stop in the middle of it and start decorating my own house. ❤😂 now I’m finishing the video!!
halloween vlogmas but call it vlogween. It's giving halloween, it's giving queen. How can you not? Plus it makes up for the proper vlogmas that will be missed due to babies!! p.s. the babies are due on the birthday (15th December) and I'm so excited for you guys!! <3
Now I need to get myself a oogie boogie inflatable
5:04 I wonder if they know how beautiful the clouds are above & through the car sky light aka "sunroof" the good old days & convertibles or drop top! 😂😂! Nice!
Happy OCTOBER 1st 🍁🕯️🍂🌩️🍁☕️💀🎃🕸️👻
Vlogoweeeeennnn! Please. 👻
Enjoy the desserts very slowly & careful! As I drool🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤 on the pc screen!
ahhhh I can't wait for the babies and to see y'all be amazing parents <3
4:08 I am in fk'n Heaven!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!feed me!
I think you should name your scarecrow George❤️
She's literally Shane. 🤣🤣🤣
Do nightmare before Christmas so it can stay up until Christmas or get fall color light for the house so it can be like Christmas lights kinda feel 😂
I'm not gonna lie. I'm kinda sad the babies won't be coming home to Colorado. Lol. Don't overwhelm yourselves trying to worry about vlogmas. Babies are most important. I cannot wait to see fatherhood on y'all. Happy fall, fellas. ❤
Okay, but I’m loving the longer hair, Ry 🙌🏻💕
I put my Christmas decorations up in August👀 , Christmas can never to be to early !! You should definitely put them up now
Just do a vlogoween. Instead of a vlogmas
Shut up my birthday is December 15th❤❤definitely a rly good birthday
You could decorate all nightmare before Christmas and it will be half Halloween half Christmas ☺️
Shane is looking great
Being a new grandma, DO NOT put your beautiful babies on the internet! My grandson will be 5 months old this Friday and he's never had his perfect little self anywhere on the internet and we're a family of nobodies. Keep them safe. Blur their little faces if you have to.
Not me screaming VLOGAWEEN. 😂
I never comment but Shane you look like you lost so much weight you have never been thick but you're looking great!
I always love to watch y'all's videos both of you are totally awesome
Shane! Nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween movie!!
Name for the Scarecrow: SCAREMYYYYYY 😂❤
SHANE, NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS IS NOT A CHRISTMAS MOVIE. ITS EVERYTHING YOUVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, THE PERFECT COMBINATION OF BOTH HOLIDAYS. PLEASE WATCH IT, LADIES. You'll understand why it's so huge every year. Love you guys but please just watch the damn thing!!! 🖤🤍🖤
Listen!!! You NEED to watch a Nightmare Before Christmas right NOW!! It’s a Halloween AND Christmas movie and it’s a tragedy that you haven’t seen it yet.
“Over priced” 😂😂😂
It’s vlog-o-ween
Shane looks great! Colorado is def ur guys happy place.
Just done show there face after they get so old just show there backs
Vlog-o-ween
As a 12’ skeleton enthusiast, everyone goes through the phase where they realize you usually cant just walk in the store and buy one. Unless you’re very lucky. These are like Tickle Me Elmo demand. Its a whole cult. Also the chest doesnt light up, thats an additional light kit purchase and not worth it in my opinion.
Vlog-o-ween
Boys poulet is chicken in French 😂😂 love yas
“Do we call it macaroni and cheese?… wait”  🤣🤣
Sorry Shane! Ryland gets 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 Taurus's are known to only process so much at one time! I'm guilty of it! 🖐ACCEPT IT! When your boys are old enough! I guarantee one of them will say something! It is part of our Character!  much much Shane!
🎃 VLOGOWEEN! 🎃
HI GUYS I LOVE YOU A LOT
Go get LEWIS FROM TARGET IMMEDIATELY
That scarecrow looks like he walks around at night😟
Thank you both for existing and sharing your lives with us🤍 you're a light in my life
🍌creme pie! Wow! Ryland!It's out of this
vlogoween
I agree with Ryland, wait till you get to LA to get the Christmas Stuff ready in November, Sorry Shane. haha
Poulette means little chicken (animal not the meat).
What is that on his back? 🤔 🤔 a mini fridge? 🤔 🤔 😂 😂
Ry giving Shane the bigger half of the chocolate chip cookie... everything ❤❤
My aunt got me an Alpha fur teddy bear when I was a baby, Im 23 and it still sits on my self. It would be a cute gift for your babies that have double meaning.
with Shane’s obsession with disney lately…how has he not watched Nightmare b4 Christmas. Homework! so iconic.
Same Due Date! Can’t believe I’m having  second child the same day as THE Shane Dawson
Omg I have SO much Nightmare Before Christmas merch and I’ve never seen the movie. 😂 My hubby works for a merch co and brings random stuff home from sample sales.
Vlogaween
I would have called them in advance and told them who you are! If they do not know you by now! Just a suggestion!I would have had an Anxiety attack right there were Shane is outside on the porch leaving! we got to go we got to go!
Shane i thought you hated minions!?
I am SO confused. Are they moving BACK to LA and raising the babies there? It sounds like they are setting up the nursery in LA and  not Colorado? I thought one  of the reasons for getting the house in Colorado was to raise the babies there and NOT LA? Like I said. SO confused! LOL
I love the fall vibes
He’s a …. Fiesta 👀😂
Why is that macaron so HUGE omg
Tile for Halloween vlogmas could be vlog-o-ween 🥺😂
Just come here to say Vlog-oween 👀🫶🏻
Remember when Shane loathed minions?!
Always live for Shane’s food critiques
Can yall send me 2 of those cookies? I need to put marshmallow in between them and put it in the microwave so i can experience heaven
Waiting for Shane to realize they make spooky villages
Living for Ryland with the longer hair. It looks so good! You are both glowing.
Who says we have to follow traditional vlogmas rules 😂 Im living for it now!!!! This is my absolute favorite time of the year and watching these types of videos just sprinkles more holiday vibes in the mix!  💜🧡💚  Next Vlog:  13 foot skeleton takeover 😂😂😂  Love you guys so much 😊
The night before Christmas is a Halloween movie
Do nightmare before Christmas and keep it up thru December!🖤💙💙🖤
you could do "vlogoween" instead of vlogmas!!
Okay but that bakery could literally be the new and IMPROVED Krispy Kreme’s (as in its gonna pop OFF and go viral)
Get those babies out of California as fast as possible get them to Colorado in fresh air n where ppl actually still have MORALS.
You guys always make everything look so good lol 😅 I know that might be surprising
shane with his sunglasses on, his purse in hand, and his jacket on saying "lets go its fall yall" was honestly everything i needed
Just throwing it out there, vlogween?
Fights with Shane and Ryland 🎼 Shane and Ryyland
You can live like jack and sally 🎄🎃♥️
I think you guys will know what feels right when the time comes i had wtitten out a long comment about how hou could do it like felix and just show whats natural ans how your both going to be amazing parents but it disappeared for some reason but i wanted to say you huys will do amazing and youll be amazing parents ❤
OMG NOGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS FOR EARLY SPOOKY CHRISTMAS
not gonna lie, I'm going to be so sad if we go through this whole journey with you and don't get to at least meet them!
Vlogoween!!! 😂
Dogs eat grass so they throw up. It's good for them. Clears them out. Let him eat and spewsy in peace 🤪🤣 cats do the same.
Your yard is such a mess. Why don’t you hire someone to keep the landscaping nice? When you first bought the house it was so beautiful. Now it’s a mess.
just do vlogaween instead of volgmass
I wish you guys were staying in Colorado! Love your home here and it’s so cute for Christmas! 🎄
Nooooooo we watch nightmare before Christmas for Halloween and again at Christmas. It’s both a Halloween and Christmas movie!!!! Y’all need to watch it
the boo bros scooby doo movie was my sons favorite for bit there had toe watch it daily
Vlog-o-ween
Yesss do vlogmas now i need the theme song!!!
So much room to do a haunted farm instead of vlogmas.
Vlogtober!!!
You can post the babies how Claire Siobhan does. She puts emojis over the baby’s face or photos where it doesn’t show his face
Instead of the skeleton you should get Lewis from target!!!!
Vlogoween!!!! 🎃🎃🎃🎃
Loveeeeee you guys sooo much!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I think vlogging certain things like vacations, birthdays, family outings n having the babies in them is fine because when they get older they can go online n reminisce all kinds of fun things n it will be there without having to find a video or memory card
🎃 VLOG-O-WEEN 🎃
It's decided then, y'all getting new decorations for California and having 2 set ups for whatever house you at in the future
You guys need lewis from target!!!!
RYLAND, JoJo screams when she talks too and shane doesn’t call her out EEver. be you sis 🤭😏
ARe you taking the alpacas to California?
4:43 I’m loving Rylands hair here. ❤
Holy lemon's that LEMON DESSERT IS JUST EVERYTHING I WANT N NEED 😢
Yes another month Shane!!😙 Can't wait till christmas either
The scarecrow’s name is clearly Arnold.
MOREEEEE
“Poulet” means chicken in french! So I guess that’s why there was a million chickens in that bakery :)
You could do vlogmas from like Thanksgiving til baby time!
Okay Shane and Ryland i have an idea on the babies in videos topic. So how about you vlog like you normally do and if whenever one or both of thee babies are in a shot you can just edit a little baby emoji on their face but also i was thinking that even if the babies are in a video within the first like year of their life it would be fine cause bytime they are old enough to go to like school and go to parks they will look different from age. Anyways Love yall and hope you see this!💜
Shane exclaiming "A BISSANT!" is the most relatable shit I've ever seen
Shane needs to make a shirt "IT'S FALL Y'ALL!!!!!!"😂❤
Do a nightmare before Christmas theme!
I love them together
You can do vlogoweenmas 😂
i’m so glad you guys know ordinary adventures 😭
The Colorado vlogs just hit differently. They're so much nicer/wholesome ❤❤
Shane hasn't watched A Nightmare Before Christmas!!!(the woman was too stunned to speak)
I respect your decision either way of showing the boys or not but! I’m dying to see their little faces 🥹
Edit: oops didnt realize it was Ryland's channel but my point still applies 😅   funny when I was in school I used to watch shane vlogs every morning/night and now as an adult I still watch shane vids/vlogs every sunday night before work. Thank you for still uploading after all this time Shane it's like hanging out with an old friend 🥺
Shane seems a little hesitant about decorating the LA house for Christmas but it's your babies first Christmas so you definitely should
Oooh Shane and ryland a vlog-ween that be so fun I wish I can decorate
I have been watching all of the old vlogmases from the past two years, I love your Colorado house I would literally watch you guys decorate for Christmas in July
You can hire people to do Christmas decorations.  When you get back to CO it will be done 🎄
You HAVE to watch nightmare before Christmas!!! It’s both a Christmas and a Halloween movie!
Nightmare before Christmas is an every holiday movie! It's in the trees! 😂😂
VLOGOWEEN !!!🧡🖤
HAPPY VLOGOWEEN!!!!
6:00 it is called a Macaron. A macarOOn is a cookie made with shredded coconut
Ya should just do permanent lighting with color adjustments so you never have to put up lights again
Halloween Vlogween should replace Vlogmas for reeeeal tho
Get year round lights that are discrete and not noticeable when not in use. You control with an app and there’s Halloween and Christmas themes. Put up once and never have to do it again!  My house is lit for Halloween!
I LOVED this vlog! Please do more like this ❤
I had fear watching Ryland hold all those cake boxes with one hand 😭
VLOGOWEEEEEEEN!!!!
Yes I say a Halloween vlocween. That would awsome.
1:29 I’m stressing around 🤣🤣
That criscuit even sounded like a foodgasm
Spookmiss 👻
i think that you should address this
Glad you say you trust pewdiepie. His opinion on all of this is great and he's doing an awesome job. ☺ X
You need to do VLOG O WEEN then straight into Vlogmas ❤
im happy that it's fall love fall
Vlogoween
Shane I have an oogie boogie tattoo!! I have a patchwork sleeve that’s nothing but Halloween theme🥰
2nd camera is like friend who got sat at the worst spot at the dinner party vibes lmao.
Yesss! Do a VLOGAWEEN!!!! 👻🎃
P.S. I know you sweet dads are going to be super busy after December 15th with Jet and Max, but please update us as much as you're able, as you truly are 100% family to so many of us! 🤗🙏❤
I’m over here salivating over that caramel pastrie😮
omgoodness, i was at work today and thinking i want to watch a new ryland and shane video, i get home and poof there it is, thank you
I’m one of the people who have been watching all the vlogmas videos 😂 it made me wonder if y’all would do a video for fall and y’all did ! 🙌🏻🤩🤗🤗 🎃 another great video as always 🧡🧡
there's nothing more wonderful than rylands vlogMAS *LIVE* from *COLORADO* !!!
As a big Colleen hoover fan, I need to know how Shane knows Colleen…
I love how much you guys love food because SAME. I wanna do taste tests with y’all!
Coming from a 3 time mom, don’t stress yourself over the nursery! Give yourself grace and time if it isn’t 100% done that’s fine! Those babies are going to need to be within arms reach for a long long time! Just love on them and sleep when you can! Parenting is hard but so so worth it!
He is from Paris FRANCE MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
So excited for us to have babies around the same time!
I love all of the decorations! Imagine if one year you put every single holiday decoration out at once in different areas of the house for fun! 🎃🦃🎄🎆💘🐰🎇🎂❤️
Why are you growing your hair
not me immediately running to amazon to get Shane’s amber glasses for fall. i’ve seen them in so many videos and i can’t stand not having them any longer 😂
SEE PASTRY CULTURE LONDON ONTARIO CANADA,,,My LOCAL
Vlog-o-ween
when Shane knocked on you and said “overpriced” 😭🤣🤣☠️ i screamed
I got personally offended that ryland knows absolutely no characters from the nightmare before Christmas like wtf make him watch that shit !!!
"When you meet your idols you don't care how you look" This was literally me when i met Shane! I look so bad in the picture but it's one of my favorites because i got to meet and hug Shane 😂 so that's very accurate haha
How come you’re starting out in Cali? I thing it would be SO much easier at your Colorado home with family being there.. Do you have anyone in Cali that’s going to be able to help out?
First off… nightmare before Christmas is both a Christmas movie and a Halloween movie! Second of all … you guys should totally watch “Nightmare before Christmas”. It’s totally a couple type of movie. ❤
Hahahah I have my farting position too #taurusthings
I love the two toned lights looks so cool
It's called Vlogoween!
Wish you would stay
Wait a damn minute... There's no way you're not showing us those babies. I know Shane and he's gonna be way to proud to keep them a secret. WE NEED TO SEE THOSE BABIES GROW UP ON YOUTUBE!!!!
Shane is living his best lady of leisure life with his I am not labouring or sweating today. 😂 Same.
Omg my birthday’s December 17th and my son is the day after mine that’d be amazing if our sons had the same bday! 🥹💖✨ Sagittari are awesome 😂
like why is there still even a california house at all?  it creates so much conflict of interest.
Picture it: "HalloVlog" or "VlogOween" either way this should be a thing! 😌
PLEASE do a haunted Christmas scene at your old house!! I'm talking zombie snowmen, zombie Santa, so then y'all can leave and leave the lights on timers and it'll still work for Christmas and be a haunted Christmas ooo oh idk about that name but hey
Target has an Oogie Boogie candy jar! You absolutely need it.
Love 😂
Im all for the combination decorating idea call it either hallmas or weenmas
Fefe is like Mary from RHSLC! Pop off little girl
VLOGGOWEEN!!
6:52
Have you or shane seen the tiktoks with Lewis the giant jack o lantern grim reaper at target!?!! cause i swear you’d both love him 😂😂😂❤️
That moment when you’re eating a krusteaz lemon bar you made that morning when watching thr video😂 SO specific.
Omg!!!!!! I wait soo HARD for y’alls videos.   Love ya
solution: the nightmare before christmas 😌
Yasssssssssssss
As an idea for Shane...break out your christmas decor but dress them up in Halloween costumes. Mrs. Gingerbread can be a ghost of a mummy or something lol
Technically Nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween movie and a Christmas movie👻🎃😂
❤
Im a big lemon fan too...that also kind of reminded me of the scene in Hook where they do the make believe dinner and the foods looks very sweet and colorful 😂
Vlogaween
Is Shane wearing a cooler back pack?
Vlog-O-Ween
Yes instead of VlogMas do a Vlog-Oween series!!!!! All things spooky!!! You’ll probably start a whole new trend too lol 🎃
VLOGOWEEENN
I love you guys
Alternate the colors on both railings!
I've never heard anyone pronounce it "mac-ron"... But I'm from Texas so...
okay but hear me OUT… film videos for vlogmas during november and then post them during december so you don’t have to stress during christmas :)
As a parent who goes trick or treating, the decorations are great so far. I showed my 5 year old and she wanted to go over for candy. Colors are perfect.
Vlog-o-ween?!?!?!?
Hi guys, I don't comment much but I do watch your uploads, yours, the SIP, Shane's and Morgan's.  I just wanted to let you you know , and if you could pass on the message to all, that I am a 55 yr old woman who just had a heart attack and was told to reduce stress in my life.  I have spent the last week watching your current and past vlogs and they have put a smile and made me laugh and put me in a happy place.  Thank you all!!!! It has helped. PS. I can't wait for you both to be parents but please do not show them on social media.  They did not ask to be on here. Blur their faces or something when you have to.  Let them have a wonderful childhood growing up out of the media.
Does America not have custard?
I agree with ryland Christmas in California
You guys should get your color analysis done to see what color pallets fit you best!!!!! I think shane is a bright sping, and you are a soft autumn or spring
I’m in the same boat sorta over decorating for Christmas. Due with my ivf baby end of January and I told my husband that the tree goes up November 1st no matter what
YESSSS
TBH I miss Ryland's cooking videos
poulette is a chick. if macaron are fresh the outside crust is crisp and the inside chewy, as that was.

I could feel Shane’s tiredness through the screen I get it man

You guys need to watch nightmare before Christmas it is so on brand with this whole video. It’s Halloween X Christmas
I've been wanting to go to Poulette so bad! Ya'll need to go to Dolce Sicilian Italian Bakery off Wadsworth!! Its so delicious! I try to go once a week. There is also Gallos supper club off hampden/Broadway that has a Italian bakery but I like Dolce better.
My husband makes the BEST kouign-amann. These all look AMAZING wow
Overpriced 😂😂
Do they still have Honey? I’d like to see the dogs too.

Yay you’re back, I love you guys, Ryland I always love your content I feel like I’m always with you ❤

Do they have lights for outside that you can leave up year round and change the color whenever you want?
THE SHOT OF YOU AND LIZZIE IN THE TUBBBBB!!!!! WTFFFF!!!! make that the podcast INTRO ASAPPPPPP🔥🔥🔥🔥🤤🤤
Shane’s forward swoop is starting to look like a fancy British lady’s Fascinator. :)
I love how bougie you’ve made Shane 😂❤️ I love bougie Shane.   I would love to see baby Haul or nesting videos
I just love how Shane is so excited to decorate for Halloween and Christmas! ❤
The tap tap tap tap tap overpriced sent me
Yes, Poulette is french for chicken. Well technically poulet is chicken.  Poulette is for female chicken.  It's also often term as a term of affection for a young girl :)
The title is obviously vlog-o-ween!!
A vlogoween yes!!!!!🎉
,,OR VLOG-O-WEEN
27:54 made me laugh so hard 😭❤️
Ryland!! How did you improve your hair?? Please share 😯

NBC is all year around, bb. Christmas, Halloween, watch it whenever you want!
I love the two tone lights
vlog-o-ween
Next halloween their twins will have their first costume ❤ they better have a family theme haha
VLOGWEEN
Thinks $300 for a HUGE reusable skeleton is crazy, but spend $700-$1000 EACH on like 10 different cakes that you IMMEDIATELY destroyed for your birthday.... wow.
I love it 😍
thats a macaron, macarOOns are something completely different with coconut
When I saw the shop closed at 2pm I couldn't stop laughing you guys are so funny.❤😂🇬🇧💯👍🏾
VLAGOWEEN
Vlogtober
Ugh you guys have no idea how much joy u guys bring me <33
Love you guys. I also love sweets. Try to find a Parlor Donuts. It's like a croissant/donut with excellent toppings. DO IT!
Both Halloween & or Christmas movie
Shane woke up so excited about Fall, in one day he was over it and ready for Christmas! 😂
The Halloween version of Vlogmas could be vlogtober or vlogaween.
I want to mow and manicure y’all’s grass so bad!!! Those weeds are out of control. 😣
Rylands hair is looking so good!!!
27:10 vlogween 🧡🧡🧡
Can’t trust google or any map for that matter these days, places are all fucked up since COVID
Shane looks so slim, periodd!
It’s vlogaween time
Shane you don’t know me but I will travel there and decorate for Christmas for you both 😂 I got it no worries! But fall needs to have it’s time 😅 I’m a twin too so I’ll bring my twin and we will leave twin tips for y’all 😅
You guys :,) your babies have my birthdate!
MACK-AH-ROONS are a cookie with coconut (sometimes drizzled with chocolate)  MACK-ROHNS are the little delicate pastries with the fillings that you tried.
The minion can be converted to a Christmas decoration just by putting a Santa hat on it.
i absolutely LOVE the colors of the halloween doorway it looks so good the oogie boogie gives the perfect contrast ❤its so cute! honestly so excited for future twin halloween costumes!! 🩵🩵
VLOGAWEEN!!!
I became a mum for the first time 5 months ago and do not feel the pressure to vlog for us it's a fucking roller-coaster and you 2 will need to team up to simply survive everyday 😂 As much as I can't wait to see you guys with the twins do whatever you feel right at the time and honestly take your time to just be with them ❤
I was scared… the thumbnail pic looked so serious but it’s fall yall, and I’m excited!
That plastic container with so many decorations is so much like Sims 4. 😂 I want Ryland and Shane to try Sims 4. I think they'll like it since they like decorating and Animal Crossing. Shane and Ryland, please check it out .
I'm here for Fallmas
Vlogoween 😭
Fall vlogmas- pumpkin patches, baking fall treats, haunted houses….
Okay I don’t want to scare y’all but plan for babies in November JUST IN CASE! My family is filled with them and they are always born a month before due date. Typically twins show up earlier.   ALSO I thought you were raising them in Colorado! I’m ready for that shift to fill time colorado dads!!!!! Lol y’all got alpacas that need you too!!!!!!
Vlogtober 💀👻🎃
you should surprise shane with a giant skeleton!
Bad time for the jojo comment 😬😬😬…..
My favvv guys to watch on rough days, love love you guys !! Thank you for the smiles <3
The first one (the caramel cinnamon roll thing) looked like two ghosts on top…..when you cut it! Looked delicious ❤❤
i feel like what most influencer moms do is they are fine showing their babies untill 1 years old their face get more recognizable after 1  . there’s plenty of moms who don’t do it tho at all. it’s whatever you feel is best for your babies
How have you guys NOT seen Nightmare Before Christmas? I watch that on Halloween sometimes, and DEFINITELY Addam's Family Values and Reunion, too. Get on that, girlies! 💀🎃❤️👍 oh, I got it: Vlog-o-ween!
There's a huge skeleton near my mother in law's that stays up all year, and they decorate it for the holidays. You can buy Santa and Easter hats for it online.
poulet is the french word for chicken btw
Spookmas for halloween vlogs :)
Intertwine the lights, that looks soah cool!
Poulette is chicken in french :))
So they never addressed anything lol. I’ve been waiting to see what they are addressing.
The decorations look adorable. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a Halloween and a Christmas movie at the same time. Ryan should definitely check it out it's such a good movie
Vlog mas for Christmas maybe spooktober for Halloween vlogs???
I feel like a Halloween vlogmas would be like a "vlog-oween"
please do vlogween! its my favorite holiday. also i suggest putting your christmas tree up and making it a halloween tree!
VLOGAWEEN
Fall doesn’t start without a ryland and shane vlog
This sent me 2:31
You guys could always do vlogtober instead of vlogmas!!!
ID BE LIVINGGGGGGG for a month of vlogoween
I rlly love Colorado content and house sad to see yall leave there 🥺❤️
I just read colleen hoovers book verity from the library randomly. Dang, it's so good.
Happy Vlogoween! 👻🎃🦇🧙🐈‍⬛
Anyone notice how skinny Shane is getting? Omg??
I am happy for you guys!! Hope we get to see the babies!!!
Rylands intro: bum bum bum bum BUM BUM .. BUM BUM .. BUM BUM …   Me: bum bum bum bum BUM BUM!! BUM BUM BUM 🦟🦗BUM BUM BUM 🦟🦗🦟🦗  😂
Why don't we have bakeries like that around here? OMG 😢
Shane is a forever mood😂❤
Shane is looking very slim
The 12 ft skelly’s usually sell out in July 😂 people set alarms for release day and everything. Also, Vlogoween is definitely a thing
A volg-o-ween 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Something about these fall/winter vlogs always make me so comforted!! Have a lovely week guys 💙💙
Paulette is chicken in French
Shane is me 🤣🤣 pushing my good idea onto my husband because it’s a great idea! 🤣♥️
The shed of honesty ✨
I’m so here for a Vlogween!!!! 🎃👻💀
Just do a nightmare before Christmas theme. That's what disneyland does for the haunted mansion.
Love all the decorations!!😍
Maybe, "Vlog-o-we'en"?
Here (canadian french speaking) “poulette” is a hen, (the female of chicken), the real word is “poule”. Woman also call each other poulette” kind of like “chick” that some English people use
VLOGOWEEN!! 🎃🎃
I love the Halloween decorations and the lights separately workkk
I have to say I love you videos and you guys but you need to watch nightmare before christmas it's am awesome film and it is a Halloween film, people think is a christmas film coz of the title and jake skeleton taking over christmas but im an interview Danny elfmam and Tim burton both said it is a Halloween movie. I just think it's a film you can watch Halloween and christmas lol ❤😊
VlOG-GEEN 🎃🖤🖤
Shane is me fr i have gone Fall insane
As a mom of 3, please don’t feel pressured to do vlogmas or upload at all while you’re in the newborn phase.  It flies by, soak up every second and take the necessary time off.  Also, you’ll be exhausted lol relax all that you can.  I think doing it early would be a wonderful compromise.  But please don’t feel like you need to be uploading when you have week old babies!!!
Christmas won’t be the same without VLOGMAS 💔😭
Heyyyyyyy
Nightmare before Christmas is also a Halloween movie...
I‘m so sad there is no christmas in colorado this year for you. Why did you decide to start in LA with the babies? Colorado is so much more home‘y
❤❤❤
Yay! My favorite time of year!
Shane lost some weight his face looks slimmer.
HAPPY VLOGWEENBUTMEAN
i don't know why but when you yelled "A BISSANT" i almost chocked 🤣🤣🤣
The porch turned out super cute. ❤
ryland and his longer hair looking more and more like a DILf.. i’m liking!!
Macarons and macaroons are two different things…. 5:59
Happy vlogoween!
There's a chain called Paris Baguette and it moved into this city about 30 minutes from me, and my first time going there I got WAY too much.
They both have the same haircut
Shane's mouth pop just gave me life❤ simple things like that make me happy🎉
call it Vlog A Ween!!!!!!!!
Happy fall yall
VOLOGAWEEN?!?!?!!!!!
Vlogoween
Absolutely love Shane's laugh when it's a mixture of horror, wonder, and amusement
Ryland your hair is looking sooooo good
Just put up lights now (if you haven't already) and then they're ready for Christmas when/if you come back.  Crisis averted. :)
Poulet is chicken in french- guessing it's a French bakery 🐓 Macaroon- also French 🙌🏻
The way I could not stop smiling the whole video is so funny to me!!
I wanted that big skeleton!!!!!
🧡 Happy Falllll Yaaallll 🧡
Home Depot associate here.. The skeletons usually need to be special ordered in advance. At least in my experience with my area
Omg i love Y'alls vlogs so much that I need them to last hours lol. They literally make me so happy! IT'S FALL YA'LL 🍁🤎
I love how you & Shane made new channels & your fan base are non hater ass biches!! We all see your growth!! You guys deserve it all!! Especially for entertaining us viewers!! You give us nostalgia watching your videos!!
Ryland trying to pronounce a French word when he can barely speak English. Sorry. I had to. 🤣
If you want to show off your babies, I have seen others who put emojis over the faces of their babies so maybe thats something you can do :) but dont apologize for your vlogmas your babies comes first .
Love the vlogs. Do a vlogmas Every holiday we're living for the decor inspo❤
Will you guys take the alpacas to l.a ?? They would need a lot of shade since their so used to cold weather & more haircuts 😭😭🥲
YYESS I MISSED THESE VLOGS SO MUCH!! always brings me so much comfort watching you guys! already can’t wait for all the upcoming halloween / christmas vlogs to come 😭
Love you guys!❤❤
VLOGWEEN!!!
I love Shane’s reaction to the front of the house!
Man now I’m going to have to go to that pastry shop and get fat! Lol
Here in New Jersey people put the giant skeleton on the outside of their house for Halloween looking like it's trying to get in and then for Christmas they put a giant Santa hat on its head that should cover your HalloMass 🎃🎄
I agree with Ryland you should get a tree and decorate for the California house it will be the babies first Christmas. You will want personal pictures and videos with their first Christmas. You can live your lives normally and do your videos as you choose and you can blur the babies faces if you feel uncomfortable. I don’t think you guys will know until the babies are here. Your feelings and lives will change completely. There are things you are not going to care about and other things that you will. Whatever your choice is we will support you!❤❤❤❤❤
Happy Vlog-o-ween lol 👻🎃🕸️
Please post about parenthood and little snippets of the babies when they are here, just don’t show their faces!!! 😁❤️
Happy Fall Y'all!! Live Y'all
why’re you guys going to cali for the babies? i feel like the colorado house is such a family home🥺♥️
The shed of honesty! 😆
My old neighbors bought the big skeleton. They kept it up well after Halloween. They even put a Santa hat on him during Christmas. 😂
You two have to see nightmare before Christmas. That is one of the best Tim Burton movies ever! Makes me sad you haven't seen it. It's amazing 🖤🖤🖤🎃🎃
Ryland your hair looks so good 😮
Wow, you decorated your place so amazingly!!! & I can't wait to see what you do ar your other house!!! You're gonna be papas soon, ENJOY YOUR LAST PEACEFUL HALLOWEEN!!! ✌️🎃🦇👶👶
Poullette or w.e is chicken. They use eggs.
Poulette means little chicken in french
Vlog-aween!!
You should just do a nightmare before Christmas theme so some decor will already be up
Okay but instead of vlogmas why not do a baby prepping vlog?
Vlogtober!
Did Shane loose weight😮
Shane I love you but you need to settle down
As someone that nicknamed my kid “oogey boogey” I approve of this video ❤😂
Shane! The beauty of the movie the nightmare before Christmas is that it's a Halloween AND Christmas movie!
Poulet, pronounced poo-lay. Ha is French for chicken
Vlogo’ween ❤️❤️❤️
Vlogween
Just need to interject about showing the babies. I think if you hide their faces people will try to stalk you and get pictures of them. I think you might as well show them once in a while , but you don’t have to make the show about them. To me that is exploiting them.
I think, y’all should go to cali early and decorate early. So right after Halloween when you leave, decorate the house Christmas as you get the nursery ready. That’s if babies don’t get here early bc twin pregnancies often don’t make it full term. More than half the time it’s a few weeks to a month early, still healthy but it’s harder on the body with more of them so they might be here really. I would say rush to get the nursery done right after Halloween bc after Halloween, anything can happen and they can come at any point.
Yeeessss, do Vlogoween
Colleen Hoover ❤
Why not bring the babies to colorado where all the family is to help you guys with the babies?
Awe I’m sad there won’t be Christmas at the Colorado house 😢 are you not making a nursery for that house?
"Ew it's in your fart position" 🤣🤣🤣 that made me LOL
So excited for another vlog that I can watch 20 more times! You guys make me so happy!
The only page where I LOOOOVVVEEE click bait. My favorite couple 😭😭😭😭🩵🩵🩵😊
i love the new editing ! keep this guy when u go on paternity leave
Vlogoween!!!!!  I love it!
My aunt processes alpaca fur, here in Northern Minnesota! People ship from all over to have her process as it's kind of a dying skill! Look up Grumpelstiltskins Fiber Mill!
I'm so excited for vlogmas i could cry
“I’m so glad I pooped”😭😭
Macaron and macaroon are two different cookies 😊😊
Seeing Shane so excited about the 12 foot skeleton is so me and  when u seen it in person  I bust out laughing because seeing  Ryland trying to put that together and yelling and screaming  the whole time I love you you guys so much. Happy fall yall
oh my god my husband’s birthday is Dec 15!  so excited for all these boys ✨😊🤍
I’m from the Netherlands and would love you to try a “Bosche bol”, it’s like iconic haha,
Shane really gave the lemon macaron a try. He took that confident big bite 😂 I’m proud.
🍁Happy Vlogoween!🎃
No Vlogmas?!?! You’re the only channel I watch for Vlogmas!! I understand though having 2 newborns and vlogmas might be a lot to handle. You will be missed and we will have no Christmas spirit this year it’s fine though jk lol
Why do y’all both look so damn fine? It’s like y’all are drinking something special or eating a youth meal daily.
Shane’s health journey is showingggg!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
poulette is french for chicken btw🥰
I am so bummed you can't do Christmas vlog,I understand being parents is making compromises,I am so excited to see the babies!!!
I’m in love with rylands hair. He looks so damn good. His hair is just laid so nice and it looks so soft and perfect 😂 plus the earring sitch is doing it for me with the perfect hair and beautiful eyes. Yes you’re a gay married man, I can still crush tho 😂
VLOGOWEEEEN
I hope you guys do more than one Halloween video.
Vlogmas at the California house would be fun because it’s new. I like Ryland’s idea.
I wish I had Rylands energy
RYLAND AND SHANEEEEEE: PLEASE GO TO THE BAKERY CALLED PARIS BAGGUETTE IN PARKER!!!! They have the best breads, cakes, and pastries there!!! I PROMISE YOU GUYS WOULD LOVE ITTTT
Time to give up the “not showing baby faces”, Shane 😅 We love y’all too much to be so deprived, as we feel like your fam 🥰  But for real, what is the actual reason for not showing the babies faces? I guess I don’t understand. Exploitation? I would never even think that as y’all’s intention, and those who say otherwise, are just trolls 😜 Just teach those babies how to not care what the world thinks, regardless, and live your life, we all support you! 😘
Why aren't ypu guys racing them in colorado 😭😭😔😔
Thank you very much ❤❤ I really needed this amount of kindness, beauty and happiness
I had to stop mid video because y’all made me want to go decorate for Halloween
Their hours are like that because they come in everyday super early and bake all the goodies, they have been there hours before they open the bakery
LOVE THIS!!!! The decorations look great. Love you Shane & Ryland!!!! <3
It’s Vlogoween 🎃 I hope you guys do decorate your California house for Christmas. It’s the babies first Christmas you will not regret the lights and magic of Christmas 🎄
Do nightmare before Christmas theme so you get both lol
My BIGGEST dream in life is to meet y’all in person 😩😩🤞🏻❤️😂👉🏼👈🏼🥺
Oh no ryland, you been eating bad macarons if they're hard and crunchy on the outside..glad to see you enjoy one
Poulet (pronounced poo-lay) is ‘chicken’ in French.  Poulette is another form of ‘chicken’ in French.  Hence, all the chicken jars.
Tony stark glasses
I love it ❤❤🎃🎃🎃🎃
I just know my baby Ryland is a Karen sometimes 😂😂
Do a vlog every week leading up to the babies birth!
You could totally set up your Christmas lights and set them on those timers you can buy and whenever it gets closer to Christmas have Vicki or Bruce come by and activate the timers so the Colorado house looks beautiful for Christmas. 😊😊
No more sleeping till 12pm when the twins come, Shane 😂
Vlog-o-ween
Poulet (pronounced poo LAY) is French for chicken. But the spelling on your shop is old French for an immature chicken, aka baby chick.
HAPPY VLOGTOBER 🎃👻💀
Your channel is no longer a blog, it’s a good channel! Shane’s podcast is turning into the Sam thing… I used to love your videos but I don’t need to watch people eat every single time! Seriously have nothing else to film???
You guys are literally my happiness
Ryland if you want lights put up without a fight early you might want to schedule it asap. Just a heads up to save you a headache later. 🖤💕
Vlogaween!!
poulet is the french word for chicken (and since there a lot of croissant its probably some french style bakery)
Get one for Morgan to put up against her barn!
The Nightmare Before Christmas is actually a Halloween movie!!    ❤❤ love you guys!
I always get so EXCITED to see Rylands vlogs for fall/Christmas <3 IM SO HAPPYYYYYYY
SHANE!! You need to watch nightmare before Christmas it’s a must watch for Christmas and Halloween
VlogOWEEN!!!!
I think it’s pronounced like “po-yet” bakery because chicken in Spanish is pollo but the double Ls make a y sound
The editing is my absolute favorite. Cracks me the hell up🤣🤣🤣  Also. Vlogoween sounds nice
The whole country of the Philippines celebrates Christmas on September 1st...we have the longest Christmas 😍🤣😊
OMG....the amount of yarn you will get out of those bags 🤩😍 Amazing! As a crocheter and fan, id love to see your progress as you get into making things!
I was so excited to see a new video 💜💜💜 I love Ryland and Shane fall vlogssss!! You both are so entertaining to watch
Happy vlog-o-ween!! Soo cute. Love the two tone railings!! 🍂🦇🍁👻👻🤎🎃
"BISSANT"
You can do “VLOG-O-WEEN” 🎃👻🦇🧡🖤💀
POULette= Poultry 🐓
I know you wont see, this but those hay/straw bails need to be disposed of before they get wet and burst into flames
Love all the decorations.
December 15th is my brother's birthday
Ok please tell Shane nightmare before Christmas is both a Halloween and Christmas movie. Tim burton even said so and he is the one that created it.
Hahaha y’all should call it vlogween
Pt 2 asap.  Beyond excited for you!
Why isn’t there a warning on this to go grab sweets before watching?!!! 😫😫
Macaroons are actually different!
Vlogween!
there's nothing more fabulous than rylands vlogs *LIVE* from colorado!!!!!!!
Do a Nightmare Before Christmas theme. That way you can keep the same decorations out for both Halloween and Christmas. There, problem solved lol
That’s lemon curd in the middle Shane
Ryland !!! Your hair looks amazing!!💜😍 drop your routine!
Just a thought, if the string colored lights are long enough you could do both on each side- Just start from the bottom and cross them over at the top! 🧡💜
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Those 12ft skeletons sell out every year on the first day 😭
The skeleton is nearly impossible to get! Its been a HUGE thing for about 4 or 5 years now. I think home depot only gets so many so that its stays as the most sought after decoration. 🫶🤗💀🎃👻
My dad was just diagnosed with lung cancer last week, you guys bring me true joy I love you so much
Mini vlogmas in november is great but hold on to your hats because you may need to take some space as the date gets closer so dont make promises to us or yourselves lol go with the flow is the definition of parenthood 😂
LET'S GO SHYLAND FAM! ❤️
Why even get alpacas if you're just going to keep abandoning them??
11:38 I know it’s stupid but you did the mouth pop😩😩 I missed it lmao
I feel responsible somehow so I must let you know, if you go through with showing the twins very often the dad challenge podcast will probably start making videos about y’all
shane kills it in every vid he will never not be funny omg
Cats and dogs like to eat grass. Which DOES make them puke usually  But they usually do it if they have a sore/sick tummy......and maybe other reasons too.  But that's what my vet told me 🐕💚
The decorations for the front of the house at the end looks amazing, it’s gorgeous!
Poulette is chicken in French :)
1 baby us hard for 2 people. They eat every 3 hours tops n can take a hour to eat a few Oz. Unless ur fam is staying with u first month in Cali I think it's a bad idea.... don't be afraid to ask for help. Sleep is hard to  get the first couple months.
i honestly think you guys could post on insta about the twins and film you’re guys version of parent life but maybe just blurt their faces on the videos to keep them private too
My birthday is the 15th of Dec.
I love witnessing the comprising relationship that they have,, Ryland absolutely not having the lights but still doing it is so cute
Omg please do volgaween I wanna see u everyday. The place looks great Ryan. As a mom of 4 can I give u the best parenting advice. Ur gonna want family around the first month's. Cali is gonna be too hot n ur gonna be feeding a baby every hour ur not gonna go for walks. I'm in Canada n winter babies are safe indoors you got heat.
Y’all forever my favorite! I love you guys.. 🩵♥️
That is the biggest macaron I've ever seen! I didnt know they could make them the size of a hamburger slider. 🤤
the "i trust pewdiepie" made me die HAHAHAH
Note there are different spellings,  and pronunciations for two different cookies with similar names a Macaron is what you had and is a completely different cookie than a Macaroon (two o's) which is a coconut delight!
A Halloween is pure and simply Vlog-o-ween, and I love that idea so much!!
Unasked Suggestion You should have light's out up that are year round like color changing so in Between holidays they can be white lights just to light up the outside spaces so you don't have to stress putting up or taking down or do the work 😂
Love the fall vlog❤ Poulette is a french word that means young chicken. That word can also be use talking to someone you like (a girl most of the time) it’s like a little cute affectionate nickname.
love you guys ❤️
Just set up A Christmas tree”❤❤  And take in every minute of every second with the Babies 😅😅😅😅
G00000!!!! 😂😂😂😂
if it doesn’t i’m calling Elon!!!! 😂😂😂😂
My twins were due on Dec 1st and they ended up coming very unexpectedly on Oct 21st haha
Has Shane seen the Oogie Boogie candy dish head from Target?!?!?!?
Poulet is french for chicken.  🐔 It's pronounced poolay. 😊
VlogWEEN!!!
I would buy your alpaca yarn if you sold it.
Crazy Question ,WHY ARE YOU LIVING IN L.A. With the BABIES.,ISN”t FAMILY IN Colorado????

i feel like vlogaween is definitely needed this month!
Shane tapping Rylands shoulder “overpriced” 😂😂😂😂😂 I’m dead
Poulet is French for chicken.
you both need a hair trim.
Vlogoween. 😅😂💚💜🧡
Omg Shane just donate all your decorations.  You give off, I’m tired and can’t and you just do everything which to be honest makes a horrible video.
The concept you were going for with the Halloween Vlogmas is literally the Nightmare Before Christmas! I love it! These traditions will trickle down to your boys and it’s so amazing. ❤
I love watching your content each upload, but your holiday vlogs are my absolute favorite! Thank you so much for bringing us on your Fall/Halloween journey! I’m going through a bit of a stressful situation at work right now and your videos help me cope more than words can express! I love you both so much! Thank you! 🧛🏻‍♀️🎃🧡🍁🍂✨
Lol  "A BISANT"! lol love you Shane your hilarious 😂😂😂😂
I love your decorations
24:12 i hope shane doesn't do this with the stroller one day 😭 😂
26:24 the fact that my husband and our two oldest are at Home Depot right now getting Halloween decorations and my hubby told me he wanted to get this big skeleton there and now I know it's 300$ 😅 good lord. Welp guess we are going all our for Halloween this year. Can't wait till they get back with all the decorations 😂
Vlog- oh- ween?!?!? Pleaseeeee I liveeee for these vlogs love you guys also can not wait for the babies!!! On or off camera they’re gna be so loved 💛💛
ITS FALL YALLLLL 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love you guys
The nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween & Christmas film, 2 in 1! I watched it every year... more than 10 times👀🎃🎄
Get smart lights- you can keep the same lights up all years long and change them for each season- thanks so much for all videos
I'd would so buy y'alls alpacas beanies and mittens
No christmas in Colorado😢😭
PLEASE DO VLOGOWEEN 🎃👻
A pulet is a female chicken 👍
I love you guys so much! Thank you for always making me smile and laugh. Wishing you a magical and happy October. 🧡🖤
Pls go to target and get Lewis 😂 “I am not just a jack o lantern…. My name is 💅🏻 LEWIS ✨ HEHEHEE
RYLAND THANK YOU FOR THE LONG VLOGS!!! WE LOVE IT RYLANTIS 🎉🎉🎉
The fact ryland was confused about the name of the bakery but in California they have erewhon like ???
Baby Vlogmas...meaning small Vlogmas. Two little trees. Definitely lights.
Vlog-O-ween should definitely be a thing!!!!!! 🖤🧡💀👻🎃
If you want to put the babies in your blogs and your pictures that's fine. Just do what some people do on the internet and blur out the babies faces. That way we can still see them but also their identity is concealed. By the way Oogie Boogie is what I consider a really great character in Nightmare Before Christmas movie. Also it's not just a Halloween movie it's a Christmas movie so every year with my sister we always watch it from October to December and it's my nephew's favorite movie and I'm so happy is because it's mine too. Well at least it's my favorite Halloween Christmas movie combo.
I love you guys so much❤ Ty for posting great content n sharing your lives. Y’all make me smile so much
I'd love a Vlog-o-ween instead of vlogmas!
Definitely want
YES Ryland ! 😁 "Poulet" IS the French world for 🐔 & "Poulette" means ( young female chicken Or Slang for a young woman ). I'm 🇨🇦 & speak 3 languages fluently, French being 1 of them. 😊 Truly loved your energy in this video & Can't wait for you both to become Parents & I'm Soo Happy For You Both - Congrats !!!
Put up your Christmas tree at the beginning of December, then you can take photos with the babies in front of the tree when they come home!!!!
My moms due date with me was December 15, and I was born December 5! I would die if max and jet shared a birthday with me 🥺
I’m super excited for you guys! I have become so obsessed with ordinary adventures because of y’all! I’ve been binging their Disney ones for when me and my boyfriend go to oozier boogie bash on Tuesday for our 2 year anniversary 😂❤
Poulet (pronounced poo-lay) is French for chicken 🤗 Loved every second of this video 🩵
I needed this... ❤
Poulette is chicken in french
Ok so you guys definitely have to sit down and watch The nightmare before Christmas 🎁👻🎃 so worth it it's my favorite movie of all time
Yes film vlogmas and all then hire editors! It’ll be so nice to have those memories too! I am so excited for you guys!!!!
the way Shane looks at him is literallyyyy the cutest thing ever
The croissant/donut situation - where I live it is called a Cronut!!
Those pastries look delicious wow! I wish that bakery was in Canada Toronto
Shane is so funny, great sense of humour 😂 I love this video, it’s so cozy. Fall is my favourite 🍂🎃
VLOGOWEEN
31:10  maybe you can change the bulbs so it’s Orange purple, orange purple and so on?  By the way I love the you guys and excited for you guys to have the twins.💜🧡
Poulette is French for chicken @ryland and shane
Please do Vlogoween!!!
Do you Halloween in Colorado and then before you go to LA clean up all the Halloween decorations and put them away so they don’t get wrecked from the snow and then have a big Christmas party at your house in LA to lift her spirits for you guys with your new family
Shane's right. Just start a vlogtobermas. Boom. 2 birds 1 stone.
I’m down for Vlogoween! 🎃
it's a vlogween hahahaha ryland, it's so easy. love u guys
Ryland how much is that thing Shane $300 Ryland are you kidding me  Shane for memories? Me lol This is why I love you Shane😁😁😁
VLOGWEEN!!!! I’m here for it!
“The Vlogmas Before Christmas”
The scarecrow’s name is obviously SCARY…it’s Beary’s sibling yeah?
Vlog'ween: costumes, decor, treats etc.
The uk is pants for Halloween. I need to move!
The nightmare before Christmas is not a Christmas movie
Vlog a weeeeeennnnn yaaas
❤❤❤
I love the two-tone lights. It looks great! Love seeing Oogie Boogie join the party! 🥳  IT'S FALL Y'ALL!!! 🎃👻
" We gotta go!" " Lock it up! 😂😂
Vlogoween duh
Lol the porch looks adorable . Plus the moth on Oogie makes sense lmfao, hes filled with bugs in the movie.
Great name for vlogging Halloween would be "Vlog-O-Ween" or something like that! I'm so excited for everything yall have going on!
Ryland, Maybe you could have a light guy come and set up Christmas lights for Shane in LA. 🎄  Then it will be all set up and beautiful for him! 🤍
If you do Vlogmas you could call it Vlog-o- ween
That came out cute! Love the two tone lights!
vlog-o-ween 🎃👻
.. such cosy videos to watch! I love them so much! 🥰
Ryland love ya, I saw the baby Brezza on your story, just be careful because those have been known to dispense incorrect amounts of water/formula resulting in watered down formula which can cause water toxicity, OR not enough water to the formula ratio ☹️ It stinks because it is a good time saver, but maybe look into liquid formula, OR the “pitcher method” 💙
El Gato en un Sombrero
Put ur ring in shane
Hold on. A 13ft skeleton?! I haven’t even gotten the 10 ft skeleton!💀
Vlog-O-Ween!!!!
U guys are gonna be great parents. But enjoy ur sleeps for now
The Nightmare Before Vlogmas 🎉👻💋
Do 31 days of Halloween instead of vlogmas!
Shane is sexy
Nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween and Christmas movie lol and I'm surprised youve never seen it. The songs are adorable
I would watch a vlogoween!
Maybe this helps. But in a lot of Scandinavian countries, you celebrate winter with lights and everything:)  You could decorate right now😍😍
I was in target when this dropped so I can’t wait to head home to see my gay besties!
Film vlogmas now and then release it during Christmas and you’ll have vlogmas ready and done since you guys already film ahead of schedule. Just saying then you won’t be stressed and trying to get it done while waiting for your twins to come. And you guys can just relax and enjoy the holidays, the babies, and vlogmas all at the same time. I love it im here for it! Ahhhhhhh!!! I’m so excited.
NIGHTMARE BEFORE VLOGMASSS
I love that is sunday, just chilling eating hahahahah and a video of my favorite couple on youtube upload a video🙌🏻🙌🏻🫨🖤❤️🖤
yesss Sagittarius gang!! December 18th here🥳
ITS VLOGWEEN
FWIW, I follow a famous healer from Australia - he has never shown his daughters face but has showed the back of her dancing and talking and growing up but never her face every. Very smart imo. :)
Spookmas ......fall christmas....🎉
How iconic that there's a moth on oogie boogie because moths and all kinds of different things come out of him😂
Vlog O Ween
So excited to see you two entering this new phase of life. As a mama to one little boy they are so special and though it will be tough it’s so worth it! Love from Ireland. 💕
Not the BISSANT 😂😂
Poulet means chicken in French.
hey, its not a croissant its a brioche (sort of)
RYLAND, I am DYING to see a video of you and Shane trying cloth diapers for the twins!!! 😂 I’m so excited 🩵
Those are MAC-RONs. A macar-OOOn is a coconut cookie
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how good Shane is looking lately?? ❤
26:27 😭
Ever heard of a serrated knife
Excited for Vlogoween 😍
It's poo-lay
You can call it Vlogaween
VLOGOWEEN
I still can't believe you guys are going to be daddy's. I'm soooo Unbelievably happy for you. You're going to be amazing parents, the amount of love those babies will have from you both is just insane. Here's to the future. Lots of love xxx❤xxx
Halloween blog as 100%%% must do!!!
No you guys literally skipped fall/Halloween LAST year and went straight to Christmas! Dont do it again lol
You have to have Christmas decorating done before the babies arrive. Please believe me, the sleep deprivation is so real with a newborn, let alone two of them. You cannot rely on them having the same schedule but I will pray for you they do. Plus, with twins, it will be harder for one to sleep while the other takes care of them because you’re outnumbered immediately. My husband and I took shifts, which was great, but we only had one at a time and we still didn’t get enough sleep. I’m just glad for you guys that you won’t have to deal with the hormones of having had a baby/babies and the potential of post partum depression. I know you guys have a million people or take advice from on top of classes to take and everything, just remember you don’t know what you don’t know so even if you think a piece of advice is irrelevant, just remember it because you never know what will apply once the babies are here. Best of luck to you both! ❤️
Oh the bakeries is verrrry french, very legit too. The third one is a delicacy from a specific region in France, Bretagne. It's filled with butter, sugar, a dangerous pastries  I might say 😂. The macaron look quite amazing too. The name is quite funny  too "Poulette" 🐔
Thanks for MAKING my day!! Trying to knock out some stuff around the house 🏡 and was hoping for an upload soon ❤ Live Large While You Can ❤ Being new Parents soon 🔜 will DEF change your schedule  Can’t WAIT
I am so tired but this makes me want to start the week-long process of decorating my house for Halloween. 🧡🦇🖤
vlogtober?
Happy Hauntmas!
Shane’s sleep pattern is going to get ROCKED when the babies come
These two can’t wake up before noon to try some pastries but can raise two infants…. Yeah right. Sad af
Vlogaween😊
I need that croissant 😮
14:25 “No hes a GATO” 😂
I think you should name the scarecrow Merle, because you said he looked a lil "haggard". Get it?  Merle Haggard, the American country music singer! 👢👢 🎶  😅 💥Or, name him Andy, because he looks like Raggedy Andy!💥 Love you guys and your great, big fur family!  👨‍❤️‍👨 🦮🐕🐕‍🦺🐈‍⬛🐈🦙🦙🦙🦙🦙🦕 💋 ❤💋
Those pastries look sooo delicious ❤ thank you for making my Sunday ❤
The most exciting thing in my life is watching Shane and Ryland getting ready to be Dads ❤
its amazing you want to share vlogmas with us but you deserve your newborn bubble. So do as much or as little as you want guys - im typing this one handed with my 8 month old who is teething so i get it :)
🤎🤎
if it makes you feel better i decorate for christmas the day after halloween loolololll
VLOGOWEEN!!! 🎃
THANK GOD I NEED THIS VIDEO TODAY! i hope y’all have a great day
Vlogoween!!!!
Rayland your hair is killing it lately i love how it’s styled 😍
Obviously the scarecrow should be called Russell…..
Idk what it is, but I do not fuck with that dog Riley. The other animals are cute, but something about that specific dog annoys the fuck out of me.
Ryland your hair looks so hot!!!
It's the "shed of honesty" that did it for me lol!
I’m dying in the next few weeks and my husband is determining the start of Christmas if before 11/02 lol. He wants to make sure if I’m around I can enjoy.
lol at Shane and Ryland not realising how perfect it is for Oogie to have moths crawling over him. 😄
If you get Sally and Oogie you have to have Jack Skellington xxx
Ride that crazy train  lol
I absolutely love these vlogs they make me laugh all the way through I’m so excited for you guys to have your babies your gonna be amazing parents 🥺
The shop you went is french isn'it ? Poulette is a word in France that we can use for a nickname The kouign amann is a speciality from the West of France Cant wait to see vids with the babies :)
I love the "shed of honesty"!  We should all have one of those!!!
You guys should get ligths on the house that tuck under the eaves and allow you to change the color. Then you have lights up year round that you just flip each section out and choose the color based on the occassion. Its expensive but worth it. Especially with 2 babies coming...
Learn to use dessert forks.
Vlogtober!
Vlog-o-ween so here for it
My Wife watches you all the time. We just got through  watching this one . Thanks for another good video
Vlogoween!!
as someone who grew up eating macaroon and not macaron, the one with dessicated Coconut are macarOOns while these are macarOn
documenting your babies isn’t exploiting them. once they grow older, with distinguishing features, you can stop showing them! no worries :)
omg yes a halloween “vlogmas” would be so fun🤭
Vlog-o-ween! I even wrote new lyrics to replace the Vlogmas song lol "We're building haunted houses Oogie Boogie's comin' to town Spider webs and black cats Witches gather round Just one thing that's missin' That the ghoul world really needs Ghosts and bats, zombies & vampires in the pumpkin patch It's Ryland's Vlog-o-ween All coming to trick-or-treat in Ryland's Vlog-o-ween"  Screw vlogmas this year, you have too much going on. But start something new! Do Vlog-o-ween!
Pls we need Vlogoween 🥹💖
Ok shane whats in ur bag. ..the back pack cooler.....lets get in to it haha😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ryland, I know you'll appreciate that a macaron is a complicated pastry to make, using all the best ingredients. They are delicate and made with all the bougiest skill and love. A macaroon is a simple cookie.  And now you know! 🎉
I feel like the nightmare before Christmas is THE movies for your state of in between the holidays it low key fits with the moment
Happy vlogmis
The throuple ghosts on the counter- it’s Shane, Ryland, and Chris 😂
macaroons are the coconut cookies with chocolate on the bottom, macarons are what 'cookie' you  tried first :D
The two tone lights honestly LOOK so good Ryland, don’t worry!!! 😍🧡💜 you might have me running to Home Depot now to get that trick or treat dog 🐶
Poulette is a French word for… young hen or little hen😊😂😂
HALLOMAS 🎉
Unicorn Cow-bi
VLOGMAS!!! Record it now in Colorado and post them while you are busy with the babies.
It’s kinda perfect how Oogie Boogie attracted moths, he had insects living inside of him in the movie
Go to Mr donuts near park meadows mall and try the croissant donuts. Go to the French bakery Daniels of Paris and try anything they’re amazing! Daniels of Paris is in Aurora near iliff and Peoria
I live for all this sass omg I love you guys😭❤️
The orange and purple looks so amazing 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
Why dont you do vlogtober
Ryland and Morgan both dropped new vlogs today. What a perfect Sunday Funday!
I can’t believe you guys are having your twins on Dec 15 I’m literally due Dec15 too 😭🫶🏻🥹🩷 sososo happy for you guys 🥲🥹
You guys need to look into investing in permanent holiday lights for the house.  There are a bunch of videos on YouTube.they can change through the year and are so fun!
“There’s so much to do today - ugh I’m so glad I pooped 🥳”  Yet another reason I love Shane❤️😂
Thank you so much for this upload Ryland and Shane. Your videos always cheer me up and I look forward to them every week. You truly brighten my day ❤️
Poulette is a french Word you use as à familiar way when you talk to à girl you know... And you should try the kouign aman
I’m here for a Vlogween? 🎃🤷🏻‍♀️
Big Brother. Are we liking Cameron? He seems to be taking over.  P.s. love ya both!
I love how the two of you are happy. That's PRICELESS.   Pease raise the boys in Colorado. Different energy.
I have my Halloween stuff up all year 😅
God I wish I was able to wake after 5:30AM. 😕
poulette is french for chicken/chick! probably why there is a chicken theme in that bakery!!
Countdown for the babies❤❤❤❤
Most these vlogs I swear Ryland is just a camera man😭
Shane needs LEWIS! 🎃
I love seeing you guys shop for Halloween decorations!! 😍💕🎃
Every time I see y’all it makes my day! Love you Ryland and Shane! ❤
I was having a bad day today but you guys really cheer me up thank you ❤
Wow everything looks so good 😋🤤😋🤤 i wanna try some.
I really hope y’all fly your mom home with y’all for some extra help. I love y’all so much and lots of help is super super important for your mental health and relationship! 🫶🏻🫶🏻 I’m so excited for y’all’s new journey!!
Govee lights are really cool and you can change the theme to match any time of the year
VLOG-O-WEEN 👻
“ i we don’t get there in time I’m calling Elon “ 😂
Capricorn babies💞 Yay
Macarons and macaroons are not the same thing. 😂
i’m with shane 😂 vlogmas starts TODAY ‼️‼️
Your alpacas are sooooo cute!!! Is there anyone that will come take care of them while you guys are gone?
Anyone else triggered with Rylands chewing? just me okay
Man i would love vlogmas type just prepping for babies lol
Okay I would be unbelievably excited for Shane to make a Halloween village like his wonderful Christmas one
Ryland! Your hair looks so good
It's called Vlogtober.
Are you really never going to show up the babies??
Walmart a 10 ft Skeleton lol it just doesn’t have cool eyes
I don’t think there’s anything wrong with sharing a memory or a sweet moment with the boys that’s completely different than vlogging their every move. You guys will make the right choices one step at a time babies don’t come with directions lol 🩷🫶🏼 love you guys
I loved the vibes of this! I can literally smell Home Depot Halloween decorations, I got so nostalgic seeing you guys shopping there and pulling out all the decor 🥰
😊Poulette is French for Chicken 🐓🐔 that explains all the chickens inside.
I’m so excited for Christmas vlogs ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤with the babies !!!!
My faaaaavorite coupleee ❤❤❤ i love you guys sooo much. Been watching shane for soooo so long, but i have never seen him as happy as he is with Ryland and that brings me so much joy. Im glad that i get to see more of you guys during the week. I wish you'd both post everyday. Muuuuch love from Colombia 🇨🇴❤
Vlog-WEEN! 🎃
Do FALLMAS!!!!
I’m with Shane! Go ahead with the Christmas decorations!
No shade Ryan, Ive mever seen Nightmare Before Christmas either..🤷🏻‍♀️
HAPPY *VLOGOWEEN* 🖤👻
Poulette is chicken in French ♥️
I'm so happy. Thank you for including me in your Halloween celebration <❤️
Vlog-o-ween 🎃
The nightmare before Christmas is also a Halloween movie, you guys gotta watch it because the moth on oogie makes a lot of sense and you need to see why
I can’t believe it’s already so close to the due date of mini Shane and Ryland
Poulet 😭😭😭
VLOG-O-WEEN!!! YESSS! ❤
"Shed of honesty" lol Shane
I am not sure you will be able to show relatable parenting. Maybe a good platform for product promotion, though.
I’m old because I’m just In Love with your storage!!!
A macaroon is a coconut cookie.  A Macron is a French cookie
Omgg yess another vlog!! Always makes my day better love u guys!!!❤❤
Oh my goodness y'all are having baby's I've been waiting for this since y'all got together and I'm so excited
Your decorations ended up looking sooo cute!
That lemon thing looks like it had some lemon curd inside it. That’s what the extreme lemon you tasted.
Vlogoweeeen 😂🥰🧡🎃🍂, love you guys ❤
Where can we send baby gifts?! I need to know. Auntie from Kentucky needs to send some gifts❤
I was born December 15th! cooooool
Let’s make Vlog-O-Ween happen 🎃🎃🎃
I think the bakery really is only open til 1, and they just changed it til 2 because it's fall y'all! Seriously,  for all those pumpkin pastries and then Thanksgiving and xmas‼️
It's called Vlogaween Ryland. 🙄
You both look so handsome!❤😊
You guys should totally do Vlogoween like Lizze did last year!!!!! 🙏🧡🎃💜
Twins usually come early, so you have a good plan.
Oh m ggg guys! Do like a nightmare before Christmas theme but since so much good is happening it’s more like a dream before Christmas!?
You are both my favourite internet couple❤️ I have been watching you both for years now and the fact you both have twins on the way! So so proud. Your videos Allways give me a boost to the day😊 hope your both having the best day
vlogween 🧶🎃🧡
So happy you did a new vlog I look forward to new videos from you both 💜 happy fall 🍁🍂 love you both keep being your amazing selves
Vlogmas vs Vlogaween?! I'm down for both :D
It’s vlogaween time
I know you’re excited to decorate this house for Christmas but… I think once you get to LA and start nesting and you’re comfortable you’ll want to decorate that house for Christmas since it’ll be the babies first Christmas and think of the babies first Christmas outfits and photos you can get! Lol I understand where Shane’s coming from but also where Ryland is coming from it’s probably just all very over whelming and no matter what you decide for vlogmas and what you decide to show it’ll be exciting!!
This was fabulous you guys! Well still watching 👀,  but so far i can tell the whole thing will be this great❤
20:32 I’ll be so sad if I don’t see the babies from you guy’s rather than someone else exploiting and leaking pics!
You guys are the best! You make everything so much fun!!!🎉❤
Thanks for uploading!! and loving your longer hair, Ryland!!
Me watching this on my living room TV while I put up my Halloween decorations 😂💓🎃 IT'S TIIIIIME!!!
As long as they are taken care of I guess it really doesn’t matter, but why buy a Colorado house and get alpacas then spend so much time back in LA? I thought the point was to escape the hustle and toxicity of LA life?
19:45 I’m excited for baby-mas
We DEFINITELY need y'all to do VLOGWEEN & VLOGMAS this year!!!!❤😊❤😊 Love y'all!!❤❤
Shane’s mood in this video: it’s fall y’all!!!! 2 minute later it’s christmas y’all!!!! 🤣
Yall are going to be the best dads
VLOGWEEN!!
I just watched yalls previous halloween vlogs and I'm so excited to see how this one turns out!! Luv y'all so much!!
I just had my baby, you guys are going to love having the newborns! Enjoy this time now before they come, but it’ll be so great for you both when they arrive 💙
Shane is looking snatched I’m living for his healthy dad era
Yes on early Vlogmas! We need to see baby preparations/birth!!
I thought babies were due January? So exciting.
ahh love your vlogs the best excited for u having babies and whatever u do will be perfect
I LOVE YOUR COAT SHANE!!! where did you get it from?
Light suggestion. Landscaping lights that point at the house in purple and green. THEN at Christmas you only need to swap the purple for red. I know links don't work, so here is a broken link for a visual concept. www voltlighting. com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/MG_6604-1000x650.jpg
I have texture issues, I could not eat those macarons.
It’s getting real! I can’t believe you guys will have the babies with you by the end of the year 😆🫶🏽 I was pregnant this time last year and let me tell you, time is going to fly by because of the holidays
6:17  poulette is french for a  young hen also it’s used to for a young beautiful woman
December 15th the boys are gonna be here in the blink of an eye 🥹 I was feeling Christmas babies for you guys ❤️💚
Yayyyyyyy❤ so happy ya'll posted a video today! You just made my day. Thank you for continuing to share ya'lls life with us 😊 much ♥️ from Michigan
Shane is glowing these days. I love that he’s trying new clothes and keeping himself looking great! I used to hate the chewed collars lol 😂
Your boys are born on my birthday December 19 th🫶🏼🫶🏼
So exciting getting ready for Halloween and Fall decorating. If you do decide to put up lights for Christmas you can always put them on a Timer. Possibly a neighbor can just go after New Years and disconnect them from outside if possible.
Little babies snuggled up for Christmas time in Colorado sounds adorable... Then you don't have to ship all the Christmas stuff to CA!
VLOGOWEEN  GUYS!!! DON'T TELL ME THAT ISN'T A GOOD IDEA FOR THE NAME
Let’s go!! December babies
All Hallow's Vlogmas xD
The BAAABBBIIIEESSS RR COMING ??!!!!😮🎉
Oh no, how much does it cost??? COME ON GUYS
WHHHHYYYYYY THESE VLOGS NOT LONGER😭😭😭😭
Can you guys just so both houses and get a one nicer home?
Vlogween, Ryland, Vlogween!
Poulet is Chicken in french
I truly love both of y’all’s personalities. They fit so well together and I always laugh and giggle and forget about everything else. Y’all’s videos honestly make me feel better. ❤ from Texas.
❤❤❤❤❤
The Halloween and Christmas vlogs are always some of my favorites. Mainly for the fact that Shane picks out all of this outdoor decor and watches Ryland do all the work. Relationship goals with me as Shane! 😂
Lizzie wants to do something for you guys so bad. Just 'let' her control your California house (X-mas decor) this year. Then when you get home and it's ready for babies and the holiday. * She can vlog it too
Shane said ‘A for effort, but I was seeking goop’ 🤣
Merry Christmas 🎄🎁 “ ITS FALL YALL “ 🍂🍁
Its falll y'all!!!!!!!!!!!
Always need a Ryland and Shane vlog to get through the day
Get the display skeleton
Oooo I love cronuts❤
Definitely need to watch Nightmare Before Christmas!! You guys would love it!
Happy Vlogaween 😆
The Nightmare Before Christmas sells the idea that yes you can indeed have Christmas and Halloween intertwine, it would look cool imo
You made my Sunday night.   First Morgan uploaded then this.Wishing you both all the best for the twins arrival.
I what to come over here and have some cake looks delicious. Yeah google is rubbish at times 😊
I love you guys but did you turn the volume up ON THE EATING?! 😖
Nothing like checking in on my pregnant queens while I sterilize bottles for baby ✨
Loving your guys vlogs :)
Poulet is “chicken” in French 😅   Poo-lay  How about Vlogoween? Lol
Thanks this was MUCH NEEDED ☺️☺️☺️ You guys are so beautiful and blessed and happy and wonderful 👍😊
I’m okay with it Shane!!! Christmas is the best time of the year 🎄
Macaron sounds just wrong. We just pronounce them like macaroon. It saves time. 😂
In addition to the giant skeleton you guys NEED to get “Lewis” the big pumpkin guy I keep seeing all over tik tok. 🎃
Vlogmas, you need to prep videos, and use and editor. Don't put lights on the colorado house. Follow H3, babies are ok on camera, toddlers no.
Have you considered putting a fence/gate around the lake so Riley doesn’t run into it every morning? You guys are going to need one with the boys.
Woahh The Nightmare before Christmas is a Halloween AND Christmas movie 😂
Hi guys, thanks for the update. Excited for you on becoming parents. Yay🎉🎉 happy holidays Halloween X Christmas❤
Shane, hear me out put "It's fall yall!" on a t-shirt and I'll buy one lol.
Oh no you don`t, please don`t adress anything, just show all the cool stuff you bought, 5 minutes and we done.
I have been binge watching your vlogmas as well 😂❤
It’s _SPOOKTOBER_ 🎉
Imma miss vlogmas 🥺🥺🥺
I think the croissant donut is called a cronut hahaha love your videos! And you guys!
😂😂😅😅😂😂
The front porch looks adorable. Yes we need Vlogmas in October
Sagittarius babies!!!
My FAVE time of the year is when you guys start posting fall and winter vlogs!!!! I swear it heals my inner child seeing you guys decorating and going halloween and christmas shopping, and just being so loving and happy together! Thank you for always being so fun and a true joy to watch!
you can call it 🎃spookmas💀✨✨
Not me responding to Shane when he asked if we were ok with early Christmas decorations 😂😂😂 I’m over here like “yasssss”
The lights on the porch look great! Don’t second guess yourself
I would love to see Morgan decorate your house for Christmas.
This is the energy I needed today 🥲 thank you! ❤
Macarons and macaroons are two different desserts that’s why it’s pronounced the way it is..
Ryland can we get a video of how you got your hairline back to Fabolous please? asking for a friend.
Why don’t you guys do a nightmare before Christmas theme?!?!
Ahhhhh! That’s my birthday! I’m going to be so excited if the babies come on my birthday.
Instead of Vlogmas do a "Vlogoween"!!!!
Go get another set of the purple and orange lights and wrap both colors on each side. That way it evens the colors out and will be super cute. Purple and orange and purple and orange, lol. I love this color wearing Shane he has been so happy, and I LOVE IT! Someone has missed weeding eating the girl's pasture are, RYLAND, lol. If you'd gotten the skeleton, he could have leaned on the barn. Like with his arm on the top like he was just hanging out, lol.  #hallowsevemis
11:37 😂😂😂😂❤
OMG, Shane should make a spooky village set!
I love how much more happier yall seem in Colorado so much less stressed and laid back glad  yall stepped away from the Cali life it gets to be too much there.❤
VLOGOWEEN 🎃
The alpaca look so healthy and happy 🥰❤️! They're so cute!!!
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH AAAAA
I literally wait daily for new videos with y’all. It’s my happy place
I’m gonna keep it real watching their videos make me smile . I never laugh as much as I do when I watch them . Love you guyssse ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
It's a cronut guys 😂
🌍
Where is Shane's wedding ring
You have to do a tree I know they will not remember it, but it will be their first Christmas.
Coming straight over from Morgan's vlog lol
I’m waiting for Shane’s man bun
Poulet means chicken in French, maybe that’s the reason?
Cooked chicken is “pollo” and if you were referring to live one it would be “gallina”
My daughter n I have been setting up our collection of Halloween decorations. I wish we could buy the decorations she wants but with her chronic health issues we have so many medical bills 😮‍💨 lol our daughter is 7 an her names Hermione btw 😂 she’s currently watching with me an only 3 minutes in is laughing at Shane’s antics lmao 🤣 she says ‘Shane’s SO fabulously sassy today’ and yes she said it with the hand on her hip n finger wag 🫣
Ryland, the long hair, the facial hair... wow! You always look great, but I love this look on you! And the matching color shirts on accident, I love it <3
I have become OBSESSED with Ordinary Adventures because of you guys! I'm currently watching every video they've ever made. Thank you so much for introducing them to us.
Sitting down to this video now. Love your uploads.
I wish Shane update his hair style either grow it out long or trim it up. I hate the swirl you look like flapjack you look like a little kid cosplay it’s weird.
NEED BABY BOOs!!
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR UR HALLOWEEN VLOGS THEY R MY FAV VLOGS FROM U!!❤❤❤❤🥰🥰this made my day. thank u ryland and shane🥰🥰
Ryland 😆 poulette is chicken in French 😂
Honestly, I think it's okay to show your babies a little on camera, but I think after a year or two is when they start to look how they will and start to get recognized. I think that's probably a smart time to stop showing them on camera.
Vlogmas whenever we don’t mind we love it whenever 😍😍💖💖 even in may! Haha
❤❤
10:56 chico chip?
Ya'll mention big brother SO MUCH but never do us the courtesy of spilling the tea!! WHO IS YOUR FAVE PLAYER? Who do you want out???
It is a macaron. Macaroons are cookies made with coconut.
i know it's gonna be a good day when ryland uploads
Whatever joy Shane wants, I 💯 support! Imagine bringing the babies home to Colorado....and BOOM, lights!
I love your vlogs they are amazing 😭
Damn you both never failed to make me happy... im always waiting for new videos Ryland!!!
I work at Home Depot. Now I will tell all my coworkers that Ryland and Shane went to Home Depot
I LOVE YOUUU
I always look forward to this time of year with y’all!
thanks so much ryland for making my day and posting another video!!! love you and shane so much ❤️😭
I can’t wait for you two to be parents! ❤
Ryland looks so noticeably handsome in this video!
Love you guys wish you had more uploads❤❤ OMG you have to watch The Nightmare before  Christmas.
Yayyyyy a new vlog from Ryland literally makes my whole day 😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰
Why does it look like ryland has a black eye. His right eye.
I just love Shane. His vibe is the best
I'm not sure if someone has told Ryland, but loving the hair. It looks really good on you. I wonder how it would look longer.🤔
The intro got me dead

I am so excited how I’m early! I can’t wait to see Shane and Ryland’s future filled with happened and love! Their very inspirational and my dream to start a vlog channel. I live in Vegas and rarely go to the strip but last night went to a Carrie Underwood concert and was imagining Ryland and Lizzie running through Vegas and Henderson in a panic. I love the good parts of Henderson! ❤🌺💗
Happy Halloween guys! Good luck to you guys as parents and to your beautiful new twins! Already by the intro I know, holidays will be great for the babies! ❤❤🎉
