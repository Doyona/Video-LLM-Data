Add some mango Arizona and you have heaven
"What r u doin?" "idk :l" lol
He seems pissed off today
Not frustrated, but a bit possesive and tertitorial there... in case you might want some also.
pop and juicy pineapple 🍍

Crabby
Before I die , Johnny must make me a drink 🔥
Johnny drinks said he gonna freeze a drink and mail it too me
Any special reason why u drinking so much pineapple cocktails?
I love the captain
Don't make dad mad!
He kinda reminds me of Jon Harbaugh
This is a Panama City Florida original we have it in every store but we serve it in the pineapple
I’m 13 but still love these videos
I’m over just drinking beer out of a can
All that time for such a fucking basic drink🤦🏻🤡
Where’s the umbrella?
I love how you can hear him say, "go" 😆
And there you go home boy.
I can’t drink and I love this channel
Please can you do some cocktails with Jamaican Wrey & Nephew.. Thanks appreciate
What an alcoholic
Damn that looks good 😻😺
Chill man
New Jersey all about that Cutco 🤣
Never thought I'd see Bautista making cocktails. 🙆🏾‍♂️  Just a joke.
Waste of pineapple
Bro that's a lot of waist of pineapple
8 years sober and I still remember the smell of Captain Morgan... I wasn't a big cocktail guy but Captain and Cola was enjoyable.. If I had discovered pineapple and rum I'd probably still be drinking lol
The smoothest transition ever.
Turn the music down so I can hear your dad's deep ass fucking voice rumble my innards
I can’t be the only one that thought….rum!
I can't hear shit over the background music
Alright alright... "and go" it actually doesn't go with you pretending to be always a casualty video. If its set up, you could simply be your selves. I wonder how many hours you spend to set up a short ...duh!
Wasting pineapple
I'm allergic to pineapple and watching this hurts 😄💔
Your videos suck. I literally can't hear anything.
pineapple juice, fanta fruit twist and spiced rum goes crazy
He’s half cut
I should call her
I would love to come hangout with you guys you make some of the best looking drinks alot I have never heard of
Alcohol is icky
Show me something that is made with southern comfort (soko) I actually took soko with blue raspberry fanta I think it's called and made a delicious drink but why don't y'all show me something else to make
was that "juicer" made out of a drill press or does it just look like one. if yall made it or its custom made then very cool very unique
The acid in pineapple eats you back , dissolves your gums a very little bit
Is lord & lord whiskey rare
You know you got big boy money when you have a pineapple coring tool
Aaaand go
All the gadgets and shit drives me nuts lol.
The worst rum in the world. It's not even a rum, maybe he stood near a real rum. Yuck!!
Yall should make some bou lou
Sammy Davis Jr?
He just needs a little drink to help him calm down lol
Convinced this kid is a n alcoholic
Its a crime u didnt use the original pineapple as a glass and muddle the centee
You need a new knife
I love pineapple but it hates me. Every time I eat it, my mouth looks like I was chewing on razor blades.
F R E S H M I N T
Man you lost me with the captain that is not a proper rum
Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
Lol he was having a hangover for sure. Annoyed
I made this cocktail- it is very refreshing and tastes good! Excellent when served with a metal straw. I rubbed an orange peel around the rim, and garnished with the peel.
No ring tap?
Anybody know this song
Watching your video inspire me to me the Greatest father I can be to my children and I aim one day to have a beautiful relationship with my  kids as much you do
Those CUTCO knives are awesome I have a set of them.
Forgot to cut the beginning
Only rich people  can afford to waste as much as these guys...oh yeah that explains it
No clinking the bottle?
SAMMY DAVIS JR DID HIS DAMN THANG!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love how pist he is in this. This is my daily attitude when my kids bother me doing my thing
You're using Captain Morgan my name is Morgan
Tell me you're an alcohol, without telling me you're an alcoholic 🍍🥃
This has been my drink since the day I turned 21... well maybe a little before. Raspberry gingerale captain and a slice of orange 🍊 .. 🔥
Why the music so loud
Need that wit henny tho
Next time try Sailor Jerry it's way better then that girly rum
Johnny still doesn’t know how to hold a knife. Deeply concerning. I remember watching this man try cutting up onions for some bison burgers. Jesus
My mind is blown.
I never understand what ur dads saying without the subtitles lol. he’s just mumbling
One time I bought a couple of pineapples for a BBQ and I cut the head off just like that and a scorpion came out. Really surprised the shit right out of me. Literally!
Finally a short with great music- how can you beat Sammy singin’ The Fifth Dimension!
If you have a garden, you can stick the top in the ground and it can make another pineapple.
He definitely getting fed up his son keeps having the camera in his face and copies everyt hes does n says but it's fake asf n all planned
you need to sharpen your knives
Dayum dad's angry
Uuuu nice!  Pineapple espresso!
That's the cocktail I can actually try
Your knife is dull.
Fahncy 👌🏼
Wait what was he making
He was gonna put some pepper in that shit at the very end
How about some chicha ( fermented beverage made from the peel and the rind of pineapples) from the pineapple skin?
Couple of drunks
prolly the laziest video i’ve ever seen them make
Love the vibe of this content ....anyone else??
You tell drunk is drunk , when hes asked what are you doing hes like uhhh what you slurring bravo my dad n I are alcoholics
I don't even drink. But some of these drinks look so good. 🤤
You ever need more Cutco, I got you! Love your videos
U can tell a nigga having a bad day when he pulls the captain Morgan out
Squeeze
Plz try  something INDIAN ❤️❤️❤️
“Kid attempts to become an influencer, makes his dad famous instead “ the movie
Makes it look natural but he says ‘go’ lol
Malibu and pineapple for me please!
Aye captain Morgan
No 151 Rum + Pineapple Juice + Malibu = Caribou Lou
I don't drink but I would drink this 🍸
Wow. Fancy
Man, can I come hang out with y’all? I cook 😂
I enjoy the actual fatherly frustration
Ohh man do not say it again rum 😏 captain Morgan consider as a liqueur
Nice
Missed opportunity to make a drink inside the pineapple
This looks good. My go to drink is crown apple or Jack apple  with pineapple juice. Y'all should try it ☺️☺️
What a waste of pineapple! Looks good though
Please let’s get you on a better rum game
Terrible knife get some real steel
That pineapple juice looks soooo good!
⚕️is tht salt and pepper?
I want pineapple so bad but I'm so so so allergic🥺
It would of been better without the music.
Can your dad make a non- alcoholic pineapple drink please
Alright, go chops pineapple 🍍
I genuinely prefer Malibu and pineapple over Captain Morgan
I'll make it after I'm 18+ lol I'm 17 rn
So handsome, both of you are quite the pair.Dad get in touch with me and we Can share recipes.
I wanna watch em speed run making a drink
Aaand Go!
Cutco knife.. ah yes.. a man of culture
I love y’all’s channel
NO DIET TONIC WATER!!
is this like hobby drinking?
What brand/model is that artesian juicer?
Shitty music is always so loud I can't hear his shitty dad
You edited it wrong brooo
What's a good mixed drink using Amaretto??? I need to know!! Lol
Weak alcohol content.. mix it 50/50 captain Morgan isn't strong..
He sounds mad. what did you do? 😂
Good job boys. Finally using the pineapple as a cup.
Alcoholic dad turns everything into something unhealthy
Something annoying about wealthy white men making boring content
With Sammy singing in the background...🤗
Sammy Davis Jr and Dean Martin(?) covering the 5th dimension, no?
I love watching his dad make drinks, some I try and they are always fresh. 💖
I don't like seeing your dad that angry all the other videos he seems like such a chill cool dude.and this one he's an ass
He was soo mad he didn't even tap the bottle properly and just used "eh...." Strainer for pouring..
Only Indian's know how much pineapple he actually wasted .
I’m literally underage but these are just so frickin cool
I like how he had the cut top of the pineapple BACK on top after he cut it.
You can tell this man is just annoyed every time he comes up and says what you doing
I HATE MODERN MUSIC.
Can't hear anything, music too loud
he looks like jordan schlandski from conan 🤣
Song name please?
Hardy slicer for the win. Pineapple is more of a petite carver if you asked me though
Dad's thinking Damn I can't have damn drink in peace lol
Had not heard the late great Sammy Davis Junior in quite some tine!!!!👍👍👍
Shit that looks good
If only I could hear them talking over the music
Great job. In the Caribbean we don’t squeeze the pineapple twist; we cut them in half’s and place them back in the drink around the edge.
"Go"
Terrible rum
Put that on some pizza, and you’ll be golden.
He's  frustrated because you won't move out!  You grown a$$ man!!!
Why so short on the rum?
The alcoholoic hasnt had his drink yet. Of course hes irritated.
What're you doin'?  I dunno.  🤣🤣
Make a pain killer
I see that no sign….. I’m in south Jersey ❤️🤦🏼‍♀️
Excellent  choice  of  music!!!
How do you know when to stop cutting the pineapple
These dudes make being a alcoholic look good 😂
Im just hatin 🤬🤬🤬
Club soda and puts water in it? Do I not know something they do lol
RUM
They have way too much money. I’m very curious what his dad did or does for a living.
You need to make a CARIBOU LOU, that's 151 rum, pineapple juice and Malibu, text n9ne made a song about it, MAKE THIS COMMENT GO VIRAL SO THEY SEE IT! #STRANGE
Love how he added Water to the mix. Smart
You should do a pina colada id love to learn how to make one
Can me my wife come over for drinks
when will he make rum ham
I don't even think alcohol, but I think your father is one of the coolest men I see on You Tube! 🙏🏽🤗👍🏽🤔🎅🏾🧑🏾‍🎄🎄
This dude is an alcoholic
I think your old man's getting tired of doing videos 😆
PHD Mixologist 👍🏼🥃
Sounds like Sammy Davis Jr playing there👍
This gets cringier every episode
Would be better with Jamacian coconut rum
What is club soda?
I enjoy watching this. I can’t take pineapple..
He just destroyed SpongeBob houses 🏠
Smack another glass with your f*cking wedding ring one more time and I swear…
Oh no ! Captain Morgan ! No mames wey ! El peor ! The worst
You should put the drink in the pineapple next time
He says go but asks what he is doing
I only drink on occasion,so the next time I do drink I will be doing one of his drinks for sore....seems so quenching
Funny thing is I don't even drink, but I can watch these videos all day!
That is some shit rum
LIME JUICE😊
I hate how much pineapple is being wasted :0
Excellent but I would add coconut water too!
Blender and Cheese cloth Vs that contraption?
To long between drinks will provoke a little snappiness.
I cant wait to give this to my sister whos totally not allergic to pineapple
That's called Caribou Lou
There’s a lot of alcoholic’s watching this, Me pouring while I watch!!!
I'd be drunk 24/7
Go easy on the ol man he has had about enough of you and your camera everytime he goes to make himself a bev😂😂
Hey Johnny Make another one with the Brugal Rum  Hope you like it
Its non alcoholic drink
What’s your favorite instrument mines the trumpet
Captain Morgan isn't real rum, I'm disappointed.
We know this is your gimmick so stop with the fake scripted theatrics
CUTCO
Shout-out the cutco chef knife tho
GOOD MUSIC
We got a dull knife today
Me likening every video for when I turn 21 so I have unlimited options
Which tool or gadget does he not have
I have that juice press. Love it.
You guys might have a drinking problem
I can't hear anything being said with how loud the music is
Be nicer to your SON! That would make a nicer video! Just Saying! 😘
Lately your channel has been my fav..😭 feeling the family vibe
You should know that all drunkards will be cast into the lake of fire on the day of judgment.  Your wickedness is coming to an end soon enough sinner.
This is the American dream.

https://youtube.com/shorts/HQ8YjYRDte4?feature=share
No grown man should drink Captain Morgan.
Song?
This guys an alcoholic
This is drinking w class....huge importance of being an slcoholic
Love the background music!!!
See! You guys drink spiced rum! Lol 🤟
You guys have THE best music on here!
"Squeezing sum pineapple, what're you doing?!" First time he says that
This man has every conceivable gadget
I love rum
I had this frozen at Disney’s art of animation and OH. MY. GOD. it was heaven
Hi I'm twelve and I love the videos, could you try to make a non alcoholic drink with fruit juices that I could make at home?
I wish I had a dad like this
A little extra liquor to deal with his son lol.
Looks like shit
I can't believe how sticky that countertop is gonna be after this
Sammy Davis playing in the background! So cool!
I hope your being appreciative towards your dad and ma he practically is providing content for you which has brought you to being successful in this way it’s more than just money and I hope y’all have a healthy relationship I’m praying for all
The music alone is worth watching these shorts (anyone got the sauce for this one? Sounds like Bobby Darrin but not too sure)
Does anyone know how there rich?
I’ve been sober for 15 years
I got shitfaced on those in the Polynesian Bar at Disney.
Lol was that pepper at the end??
I like pineapple but I'm not old enough to drink and I will never
My favorite drink, Malibu pineapple splash of cran!! OOOO! cheapest drink ever
You guys are always doing some dope shit. I love it!
That guy was a bartender
Pretty sure ur dad is an alcoholic bro
I love your videos so much! I’m actually sober so could you please do some more virgin drinks? I loved the lavender lemonade!
Why captain morgan, this boy send u to hell its awfull
Nigga is that pepper
I can bench press about 500 trillion pineapple Camel
I know the exact brand of knife.
Fans of apple,but I'm I'm destitute and can't afford it
151 Rum Pineapple Juice
These guys annoy me but I still watch it. Idk why.
I can smell this video
He seems cranky 🤣
This dad seems like the biggest douchebag
Could you make more non alcoholic drinks
This was innapropiate
I'm a big fan of pineapple while I'm talking to you wonder what it would be like to smoke the glass with some real high THC marijuana
Beer. Just beer.
I thought there was a fly around my ear
LETS GO IM THE 666th COMENT
665
664
663
662
661
I actually met these singers in person awsome experience
Love the channel and the mature approach to enjoying drinks instead of choking them down as fast as possible. But you can so much better than CPT Morgan spiced rum lol I've made better at home!
I drank Captain Morgan with pineapple juice just last night. Sooooo good
Are you guys just like hardcore high-function alcoholics?
Dad always acts like a baby. Got him a pacy yet? Should surprise him on Christmas with one.
Songname ????
The music always gets me......like I'm in a swanky bar listening to Frank drinking my cheap rum chased with RC cola...
Rep tha captain
Is this after the video where you told him he was doing everything wrong and that’s why he is mad haha
Son: what are we making today? Dad: Some pineapples 【Proceeds to chop the pineapple】 Son: So What are we making today? Dad: I don't like to repeat my words 😠
Their livers though
He is a drunk
Hey uhh what’s club soda?
They didn't smoke the pineapple 🤕
Captain Morgan? XD the worst and chipper drink in the world
Here I was thinking “caribou Lou”
I'm not a p**** I live in the lone Star State I drink everclear straight out of the bottle
Was he holding black pepper at the end?
Gallon of pineapple juice - 1/8th of a shot of rum.
These guys are pure genius. Keep up the great content guys.
Lower the music I cant hear anything
Eat the center it's still sweet and juicy it's just slightly harder don't waste it
Make a caribou lou
Any mum just turned to kahby and pointed to the knife
Love the Richard Cheese background music
I honestly admire anyone that could even enjoy a pineapple cuz everytime I eat one it's always too sour and I'd feel my tongue burning. I'll be fine just tasting pineapple flavour without the sourness 😂
Ooooh he measured his liquid with ice in the cup. F minus
Stop the fuckin song in the back
This guy makes me wish I drank alcohol lol
Your dad better have voted for Trump
You guys are some cool cats 😎🇺🇸
Love the song
He said and go at the beginning
"151 caribou lou, with pineapple juice".
Drinking some pina to Sammy Davis, Jr. Bring on the Rat Pack!
Why captain morgen?
What is he making today?
These people are too fancy for me to comprehend
U HAVE THE BEST DAD EVER I WISH MY DAD WAS STILL ALIVE HE DIED WHEN I WAS ONLY 4 YEARS OLD... 😩😔
🍍🍍🍍🍍🍍
I need that in my life
“and go”  …” alright what have we got today” …  …. okay
Captain Morgan ahhh had some great nights and worst mornings.
If you're gonna use a shitty rum like Captain Morgan, I think it's ok to use canned pineapple juice. Oh, & the worst rendition of Up, Up & Away is playing TOO LOUDLY to hear what ur saying.
Looks like pops actually needs a drink in this one. Give your old man some space but nevertheless he seems to be a good father.... CHEERS!
Dig the cutco
Just get a sharper knife and peel it, it's not too hard once u do it 3-4 times.
Plot twist, the dad doesn't even know he is popular. He just does his thing and his son records him.
Would have loved to hear what was being said but the music was blaring. Shame
Sammy davis jr
So y’all are humans not robots
Yumm!
Functioning Alcoholism sure is dapper when you're a multimillionaire
Perfect Drink Great Music Too
Man I love pineapple juice
I know the musician in the background isn’t Frank Sinatra but when I was going through these guy’s videos and heard Frank Sinatra I straight just started listening to Frank Sinatra for an hour
The way he preps this pineapple hurts me.
Cooking and drinking is life. Oh and sex too cant forget that
Is there a name for that drink
Yum
❣
I'm fatally allergic to alcohol but these guys make me want to drink
Add 1kg ice
I'd  love to hear your dialog without the hipster doofus music blaring 🎶 👂
This boy needs to respect his father more, without him he wouldn't have these videos
Piss
My wife would love this. She don't drink, but I'm positive she'll like that I'm drinking this 😏
Now put on pizza
I feel like if you're gonna go as far as fresh squeezed pineapple juice, you should do something more complicated than pineapple juice and rum. I would have turned this into a kickass Painkiller, tiki drinks are my jam.
Pubes
Love the music in these videos but it's almost always too loud🤦🏾‍♀️
10 bucks the knife is Cutco.
I’d probably do more rum and club soda than pineapple because pineapple is highly acidic and it doesn’t agree with my stomach
I drink whiskey with pineapple juice, only Glenfiddich whiskey though
I should call her
Im fan of watermelon
The video is great but the music is loud
What mixes ya got for sailor Jerry's?
Dude needs an aa meeting
Cud u please do romanov vodka, sprite, ice nd ur specialities.... 🙏🙏❤️🙏🙏🙏
WEAK bottle tap...😢😂🤣😂
Still holding that knife like shit, let me show you.
Yo dad looks pissed off lol
Disappointed in the rum choice
Dad was not in the best mood today 😥 we still love you Dad
You better save the crown and grow another one
He didn't tap sad day
Captain Morgan,really?!!!
Finally they make something I would actually drink
That looks really great!!!!!!!
This dudes liver definitely looks like rockys face at the end of the 4th movie.
He slaps everything he loves! Does he slap you as well? Lol...much love!
I don’t drink but man those drinks look so good. I’d start drinking if I could drink like that
What’s that pepper at the end for???
This makes me wish I knew who my dad is
The way he makes is cool and with so passion. Love it guys
I’m just curious. But what is up with these Italian families and Cutco Kitchen knives?…
Gotta like an alcoholic
If I subtract the club soda and substitute it with more rum does it really change the drink or would it not make a difference
Added pepper there at the end
Please adopt me... ! I'm 42 and about to be divorced..🥺
Looks interesting and affordable for me😂😂gonna try it too
Pineapple rum runners got me off my assss one night. I got sick tho because some girl thought it was better with grenadine. Made a man like me get sick off that sweet ass drink.
Wait so what is he making today?
Ahh, Juicy Caribbean rum. Love it
it looks great
I love this but I was honestly expecting better rum from you guys!  Take it as a compliment; I only expect the best from you!
I love your content but my teeth started aching watching this one hah.
Pineapple is my new favorite thing to mix my drinks with
Y'know, I've never seen yall do a pina colada yet. Maybe in an up coming short plz?
That looks delicious
Dull knife
Captains?? Your father needs to try Appletons with the pineapple 🍍
Wish I had a dad
Have you tried Whalers rum? Much better mix.
Rich people must be very bored.
What are we doing today though?
As a jew the amount of pineapple you waisted makes rumble is absolute anger and agony
If people can drink pineapple juice yall got no excuse to not eat literal dog shit. Probably tastes the same
Son try's to act like he's always randomly recording when his dad making something
I love the music you play in the back of these videos just makes it seem like im actually there
Alcoholics!!
Is it normal that I'm 14 and love bartending 😂
When I grow up I wanna be like Johnny drinks
Terrible rum
Haha Captain Morgan, poor man's rum, the fuck you drinking trash for and being fancy with it
I would be an awesome experience just to enjoy dinner and a couple drinks with you guys. I’d love to see what you guys could do with some moose backstrap or tenderloin. 👌🏼 I’d fly myself out for that experience. I love how chill you guys are. Generally I’m kinda cheap with my drinks unless it’s a special occasion. I’d also love to see you guys try homebrewing. I’m finishing a two five gallon batches. One is a mead and the other is a hard cider.
I wonder if his dad gets a little annoyed when the kids goes up to him for another daily TikTok. "Another day, another tiktok"
Now tell your pops to do mojito!!!!
These guys are amazing..
I don't understand why everybody wastes the most nutritious part of the pineapple...the core!
I'm getting my pineapple now
Miss the ring tap in that one 🤣
Your dad's awesome bro don't ever forget that
Captain Morgan ohh yeah boi
So nicely put together! I love the old new York feel to these!
Americans or how to turn to shit everything they touch...
I love these guys. Their father son relationship is envy-able.
Should have used sailor jerry
Gey, I want to know if there is something to try with a kombucha?
Drunk dad getting a little frustrated... boy that brings back some memories lmao
It sure would be nice if I could hear them talk.
This looks fire
Music a bit loud
He didnt slap the bottle. Is the fap not good enough lol
Music is too loud this time.
Dude captain morgan??? Travesty. You guys dont know how to make good drinks.
Nice too have parents who don't just wanna get rid of yah
お酒との長年の付き合いにより、メジャーカップを使わずとも美味しく作れてそう
Your dad is way cooler than mine 😞
Use betta rum mon
Yes please!
Man I'm making this today!
Yea these two are great. Nice to see a father and son not only getting along but doing things together.  Years from now, big and little Johnny and maybe Johnny “Tre “ will look at these  together and say “that was cool”
I noticed that you guys like your empress gin and Canada Dry. Are you Canadian, or do you have some connection to Canada?
This is cringe
🔪 🍍  (Wisper) "Go" 🤣🤣
"I told you!" Is all I can here and he never did tell him... He asked and said squeezing pineapple 😂
Pick up some black label captain morgan. It is a game changer and the taste is 10x better.
Can't believe Johnny drinks Captain Morgan! I would have thought he would only drink expensive rum.
Nice cutco. Show your complete set
What song is this?
He wasn't planning I  alcohol this time but after the third time answering the same question it was starting to become apparent he needed some
Man it’s sad how many people think this is a “good drink”
You seem to be upsetting this man more and more with each video 😅
LET DAD KNOW HE HAS TO TAP EVERYBODY TWICE WITH HIS RING FINGER. IT'S HIS SIGNATURE MOVE.
Of course this is what I'm watching at 3 in the morning
I like making a similar drink. Rum, pineapple and ginger ale. Sometimes half ginger ale half lemonade.
I love the mixology and the amazingly nerdy wake that you create your cocktails🔥 thank you!
I'd if its me but the past 7 video yur dad looks a bit frustrated
Captain Morgan though... Really? Overpriced mediocre rum.
The perfect drink for Pizza
He always looks frustrated or annoyed. Lol.
Cutco knife??? Handle looks like one
That cnj on the Jersey sign that stands for central nj right? Because idc what anyone says it exists.
This song sounds familiar anyone know the track name
He didn’t smoke da pineapple
"Rum" "Rum"
I legally cannot drink but these guys are cool
I've done this with Plantation pineapple rum. Pretty good shit.
Cheer up Jhonny. Hope everything turns out good bro
Alcoholic
Always chill~~~
Drunk bums
I didn't drink, but i will be disapoonted if he didn't pour it to the pineapple.  But he DID! Im satisfied
Making a cool drink with visions of Sammy and the Rat Pack. Nice video and music.
i used to make a drink all the time it tastes super good..its made with vanilla vodka pineapple juice an grenadine
Do they work for a kitchen equipment company theses guys pull out all da tools 🤣
His dads thinking,” I wish my son would stop bumming liquor off me and go get a real job” that’s why he’s pissed.
Yo he was straight up adding some seasoning at the very end lol
I accidentally made this exact thing yesterday and I’ve never mixed drinks before. It was so amazing and now I feel like the universe is telling me something. Also I tried a version with coconut water added. Bit of a different taste just as amazing.
Yeah he was a little annoyed
Huh, he didn't smoke the pineapple glass.... Must be having a rough day...
Drink 🚨
Im jealous of their relationship.  My dad died without knowing me.
Get better rum
Diet Caribou Lou. Nice.
All the gear, no idea.
Signs of an alchoholic father right there....getting all mad
I made the exact same thing but with tequila! Super bomb
Damn Pops! Get it.
Pop’s a little grumpy today?
Dude is always frustrated until he has a drink in him. FACTS
You’d need 12 pineapples for my best friend 😂
Seems like Daddy's frustrated with son riding his coattails
God these videos are great! The music, the drinks, the father son. It’s all pretty cool. Keep it up.
Gonna give this a try
I think u need to turn up the music a bit more
WAIT SO PINEAPPLE DOESNT NATURALLY HAVE THE HOLE IN THE MIDDLE… why was I never told this… I will find that who has his this from me
Your videos make me feel like he's MY dad.. Love em.
You and your Dad are so awesome chill! Watching your videos always makes me thirsty! I don't drink often but I decided to try to make one of the many I've seen your dad make . So I did,  I had some Pina so I went with the pineapple and rum topped with a splash of what looked like club soda.   Turned out SOO GOOOD! 🍍🍹
My favorite pineapple drink is the stoli doli, from Capital Grille. Might make 2 weeks to make, but damn if it isn’t the most delicious liquor I’ve ever had!
That's the first sign of alcoholism, Frank Sinatra an frustrated just cutting fruit 🤔
Guys a dick, he sells mortgages, your poor because he's rich.
Dude I love captain Morgan!
I’d love to see what kind of AR15 this guy buys 😂
🙄
I drank a pineapple brah🤔🤬🤬
Pineapple 🍍 sweet, Mmm
I luv pineapple but sadly im 14
Shittest rum ever, meant to be a fucking connoisseur
I love how Dean Martin is almost always playing in the background.  Always makes me hungry.
Malibu, mango nectar, pineapple juice. Equal parts each.
Captain Morgan??? WTF... I believe this is the first video I've seen him use rum, that stuff is fucking swish, expected a better quality rum comin from this guy, wow just wow.. wow
You get hit when you were a kid? My dad had those same eyes and that same look when he was in a certain mood and wanted to slap the shit out of me lol
I’m tired of the 10-30$ bottles bring the good stuff out. I’m not a big drinker or flithly rich but I keep a few good liquor bottles in my ALC cooler. Cant remember the last time I had captain Morgan how old was like 16 at high school party
Sammy Davis Jr tune in background is always a smooth call
Shit rum
Pops had a bad day
This music makes alcohol so much better.
Is it weird I don’t even know them and I still wanna crack open a beer with them
amazing and outstanding
You guys have great taste in classic music! My favorite genre of music‼️
Let me juice a whole pineapple for my terrible cocktail
Music wayyyy too loud
My FAVORITE drink!!?
Music a bit too loud ❣️
Oh come on. As fancy as most of these drink are, you gonna use captain morgan?  Get some good rum!!!!
Pops is pissed today...what happened?
This rich family got all the gadgets....kid even knocks on the bar In the golf club like an arrogant millionaire
Come on add some Midori, blue Curacao, Malibu and captain Morgan in the hollow pineapple with whip cream on top pleeeeesse
the 40s classic beats are nice over the videos bring them back
I ♥️ this guy.
Am I the only one jealous of all his gadgets?
I eat pineapple pizza
Tepache??
Not johnny knives. Lol
We’re not supposed to hear you say go.
the sammy davis jr is a nice, classy touch...

I'm squeezing a pineapple, what are you doing? Why are you always so dang nosey, go do your own thing!
This one would be one of my favs for shizzleZ
I can’t hear over the music but it’s still entertaining
@gabehelmy lol
Scrolling through the comments to see if anyone else noticed the boy say ‘Hey go’ at the very beginning as a cue for the man to start their little skit. I guess I am the only one that did
can watch his vids for hours and i’d never get bored
Milkshake pls
I love watching Johnny drinks...it's jus relaxing he makes it while being calm cool and collected
You could make two pineapple cups if you cut the pineapple in half and Carefully cut the pineapple crown
I enjoy watching you, but the music is so loud that I can barely hear what you guys are saying
123 go....  What you doing today
....Daddy....get drunk...... 👀✌
Probably hung over
That would be better with a splash of Grenadine 🤷🏻🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♀️
Every video you guys put up it seems like theres a new kitchen appliance in the house😂😂
Love the videos, I don’t drink anymore but I would love so see you guys make a mojito or some sangria
I hope he's not an alcoholic
Are we gonna forget the fact that he said “go”?
Wasting so much pine apple to make juice the least efficient way possible.  Smh.
Nobody is talking about how loud the music is lol
so boss!
Just saying beam has a sweet taste I would imagine this one is delicious
Looks like your pops wants to make one drink without the turd filming him .
I love you guys but pls that poor pineaple too much flesh is left there❤️
Bro what does your dad do for work?  He looks really well off.
Gold spice isn’t rum 🤢
Shout out to the greatest American made knives with the cleanest pine apple cut
I always love the choice of music for the videos
I feel like you bother him and think he's much more then just a simple man with a little class.
can you try something with Tequila?   cheers
A drink that could kill me instantly made to look appetizing I love it
A whole pineapple for one drink?  Really.
Him : I'm squeezing pineapple, what are you doing?  Me : tf it looks like he is doing! Filming. Asshole
it looks cool to have a good day... brainstorm.....i should be a better father like this somehow........🤔🤔🤔🤔
You gotta add the yager and malibu.. SURFERS ON ACID...😘😘
These guys could be considered alcohol substance us disordered, I'm an Addiction Counselor and if you ever need lmk I'll help you out, peace
I'm so confused, do these guys think people squeeze pineapples to get the juice?
Would you like to attend my next get together..you know..to mix some drinks 😀
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Now I realise how staged these are
IS YOUR DAD SINGLE!?
lol why is he so offended when asked a question.
I usually take the skin off, then ...
Captain Morgan..wtf!
My old man taught me 2 things, Jack and shit and Jack left town.  Cherish your father he's 1 in a million!
we can float among us
Can you show behind scenes too pls
Try carbonation that shit like a Berry. Would taste like pineapple cool aid
I love pineapple I used to love spiced rum as well. I would totally be into this one.
Do a simple drink jack and coke
could you make a michelada please that would be awesome!!
Ask him to make a caribou lou
He hit the pineapple with the rum
What’s his alc tolerance
I think I wanna be a bartender
I think it’s so cool that his father and him can have such a bond mixing drinks if only my dad bothered to be involved in any activity with me growing up but sadly he was never there 💪🏽 live your videos I don’t know why y’all don’t just open up a bar together fr but keep doing videos though
Dam I had no idea there were people out there still stuck on their high horse wtf am I watching
That looks delicious
Off topic, but pineapple on pizza is kinda good (I just thought I should say that because he was doing something with a pineapple in the beginning i dont wanna start a fight)
I feel like his son just Precious his dad to drink
Aight lowkey I dont even watch these to learn how to make drinks just a bonus, these things just unstress me for some reason. Like lowkey your dad is my therapist bro 😂
Sailor Jerry's better!
I wonder if he would adopt me
Real alcoholics drink 5 dollar vodka bottles out the bottle
The center core is the best part of the pineapple!
The song in the back ground is called up up and away the original is so much better
anyone else hear a fly in their ear for the entire video
That looks delicious
Fan of the knife! 🔪 and the drink, of course.
Dude miserable rodayp
Music a lil loud
When you swallow pineapple it's actually eating you at when you're eating it too
Can you make a drink with cucumber vodka I had one called Summer Breeze the other day with pineapple juice it was delicious I can't remember everything that was in it though
I'm 15 and just watch these because they're interesting
your dad is kinda hot😳
Poison is sure delicious
Must be his first drink of the day....little pissy yet.
Captain Morgan is really bad
The music though. Tune it down like 4 notches. I can't hear you guys
My dad had this “bright” idea to do this and mixed it way to strong needless to say he was drunk at 4 in the afternoon
The most violently ill I ever got after drinking was after a night of captain Morgan’s rum never again 😪
I think i would need it sweeter maybe simple sirup 2/1 or honey simple sirup but that's just my taste
What happened to the ring tapping
To be fair I didn't hear shit either music was way too loud
Club soda is sooooo good with pineapple juice I’m going to the store and goody goody now
I'd love to drink this man's drinks and watch Goodfellows.
Doesn’t rum make you blind or even death
Not a big fan of pineapple since always tries to kill me (me allergic)
Dear you guys to make the most random combination of drinks🍸
Not that it matters, but I think the format of ur vids annoys him sometimes
When u realize the Dad goin through mood swings cuz he just wanna drink in peace lol
love the song
When dad doesn't measure making something, it's a dad move. It remind me of my dad beef tartare when we went hunting, taste different each times but never getting bored of it
You guys should find the oldest wine possible (affordable) and taste test it
Y he seem mad
I wish I lived in a perpetual state of nice wooden furniture, frank sinatra, and fancy alcohol 😔
Make a tik tok sunrise corona
Do u guys have an Instagram
Ask to make a dirty Arnold Palmer? That will be fun
It has been 12 years of not drinking nothing to do with being a alcoholic or anything just stop drinking haven't had a drink since make a drink that would be good for a ex drinker could sip on
Make b52
Never drank a day in my life but I love these videos
Please make something Non-alcoholic 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Make a Moscow mule
I love this dad he is so cool.
His Name suits him the Most.....I you know you know ✌️
SERIOUS QUESTION!? WHERE IS MS JOHNNY Drinks? !
Just a son making money off his father's alcoholism. Beautiful. The essence of America!
Terrible video
I mean I think I could give that to a child....weakest pour he's ever done!
Patron
That looks so refreshing. Screw mimosas that's what you have with brunch
He reminds me of the bald guy off of Kingsman
I’m no doctor but I can’t help to notice your dad is a raging alcoholic
I say some shit online about pineapples and the wife says in not allowed to like them anymore.... this here is like hiding porn from here...thank you sirs
It's 5 pm somewhere
You did not smoke the pineapple 😭😭
You did not smoke the pineapple 😭😭
Ole cutco
Forget the music!  TOO LOUD! Sammy is good . But WAY TO LOUD!
What are you doin? Oh idk
What category of music is this cuz it lowkey fire
Bruh
“ what are YOU doing?” That question is never answered.
Lol you pretend to be a strop alcoohol connaisseur but you drink Captain Morgan... 😭😭😭
"I'm squeezing pineapple! What are you doing?"  Making you famous! Lol
Stop spying on me
I love how they always leave parts of their videos unedited
Is he just a fancy alcoholic
Your dad makes me miss mines...especially when he was mixin drinks (one of his many talents was bartending)
The amount of pineapples your dad must have at his house
He gets mad when he's not drinking his alcohol
Everything is good and nice except that u use literally the worst brand of rum 😂😂😂 captain Morgan is for underaged kids who can’t afford the real deal …. Im really sorry but that’s for washing your car or sanitize something use botugal or zacapa for example … again I’m sorry but as an rum enthusiast I can’t stand to watch someone drink captain Morgan
This people are so calm
love the new logo guys!
Loving these videos
If ya  don’t plant that pineapple
Liqour is disgusting
He is probably frustrated from all of the drinks you make him do and you won't let him rest.
Why does he tap his ring on the bottle?  Is he a retired bartender?
🤢🤢 pouaah Captain Morgan. .. first Time I'm disapointed by those dudes
Im a fan of 🍍 but i cant just underage drink right?....
That actually sounds like a good drink for people who don’t really like alcohol
I don't drink but enjoy watching your videos, thank you and keep it up. Btw your knife looks dull.
Can you make a drink for the kids that doesn't have pineapple. I'm allergic.
Worst of the channel
Song?
Wtf is that drink?
That is my favourite rum!
I hope he's not frustrated bc he needs that liquor
How do people just have anything with raw fruit? Like I can't eat most fruit without it being cooked cause it itches whatever it touches. My gums,my teeth, my lips even get inflamed. I'm really jealous that you can just eat that
Has he done a Bahama Mama? I need him to pls...
Oh Jesus...I was with u until the Captain Morgan's🤢🤢 i shutter at the thought of that stuff. Absolutely brutal hangover from that stuff in 2007. Haven't drank it since. It literally makes me sick thinking about it😫😫
He changes his pfp every single day
I find them again, yes
You should purposely mess up the drink names to make him mad 😂
Nice
If westerner know the exact way to skin off the pineapple for sure there is no fruit wasted like that
The music I always hear in these videos makes them that much better. What are your top songs or musician you like to listen to?
Aaand go 😂😂😂
Pineapple 🍍 is one of my favorite fruits 😍🥰💕
When dad is mad you aint sad you glad because he lets you crash at his pad
quick question: why was he holding the top of the pineapple on the pineapple after he had cut the top of ?
nice
hands down the best shorts content aside from nick Giovanni and Nicky Cass
I need that pineapple tool, it looks awesome ୧(＾ 〰 ＾)୨
I can't hear what you are saying because the music is so loud!
Tell him tô make a caipirinha , would love that , cheers
All I can think of is 151 rum pineapple juice and Malibu
Where I was born there is actually a factory or whatever it’s called for the rum he used
What’s the most expensive whiskey you have?
Well, that's definitely the next drink I'm making!! Dark Rum, Fresh Pineapple 🍍 Juice and a splash of soda!! Well done my friend!! 👏👍
Who sings that version of up and away
Man I wish I had the time to do this shit.
Wouldn't think he would use shitty ass Captain Morgan rum, at least it wasn't with sailor Jerry
This sounds spectacular
You should have him make a drink for those of us who can’t legally drink
I found ur channel two days ago and I love ur content
Aye sammy Davis jr in the back
Mum can we get ‘How To Drink’? No, we have How To Drink at home. How To Drink at home:  (This is a joke)
That song gives me uncomfortable memories. When I was in junior high some shithead administrators in our school thought it would be a good idea for us to sing that song along with a mentally retarded chorus. I still cringe when I think that they sent out an invitation to our families to go watch the show. My brothers hammered me about that for about a decade.
Even tho I'm not old enough to drink, I still enjoy watching these
I love the relationship you have with your dad it seems so wholesome and nice
Me a minor just minding my own business:  YouTube algorithm: might I interest you in some…alcohol?
these videos have strong pompous kook vibes
That's a really dull knife.
This guys videos makes me wanna walk on the Las Vegas Strip, head into a bar, order a nice drink and listen to Sweet Jazz while im sippin it.
Johnny drinks more like Johnny stinks
Nobody likes you Johnny drinks, more like Johnny stinks 😂😂😂
It’s a bad day for everyone if Mr. Drinks isn’t feeling the ring tap 🧐
At this point your dads blood must be 80 percent alcohol 😂
Can you do rum chota
Make the fanciest drink you can
How's your guy's livers ?
Day 1 of asking for teremana tequila
Can y’all review Hennessy or make a drink with it?
Uh oh Dad’s in a bad mood xD
You should have your dad do this but with an English accent like James Bond.
King of drinks
How much for a Sierra Madre Martini, and an Atomic Cocktail?
I don't drink but damn that kind of looks tempting. Mans got Muslims questioning whether or not they will drink that.  Jkjk lmao. I just enjoy the art of mixology.
i dont even drink and i have a need to watch these all the time lol
😍😍😍😍 man I can’t wait till October to play with drinks
Ok what is a good scotch for a first time drinker
Hey Johnny, be awesome to see a visual appealing drink made with Hypnotic!
Have you guys ever thought of doing a Masters class for people who are getting into this type of stuff
Plot twist: Johnnys dad is a Mafia Boss😎
I heard the music in the background and instantly thought it was Rocket Sixty-Nine from Fallout 4...
Your Dad is really cool, definitely cherish the time you have with him. Mine was gone before I knew it.
This looks so good, And I need that fruit crusher that thing is awesome I would make fresh fruit juices all the time
Johnny's having a rough day. The man didn't tap his ring on the bottle. 🧐
Wish I had this kind of  relationship with my dad
Do loads of mocktails
I don’t even drink anymore but I love these guys lol
I wish my dad was cool when he would drink. My dad was just a mean drunk...
Have him try happy dad
Subscribed for the inherent classy feel you guys have
I had a drink on holiday called a strawbarinha when I got home I looked it up to make and couldn't find it anywhere you got an idea how its made?
Could you do more reviews?
IS YOUR DAD OKAY???? He didn't tap the bottle with his ring, clearly somethings up
Does your father ever drink something that doesnt contain alcohol? Plz make a non alcoholic mix next.
Turn down the music, I can’t hear the dialogue
I would really love to see you make your own version of michelada with corona.
music too loud cant hear at all
What’s up dads butt today
The only problem that i have is that using that device actually leaves a lot of pineapple behind, here we have little shops that sells pineapples and they can only remove the outer layer so the end result will be way more juice, (and the core is actually not bad to eat) but as a convenience i get that that device is way easier to use.
😋
Great looks delicious
First! Great cocktail!
