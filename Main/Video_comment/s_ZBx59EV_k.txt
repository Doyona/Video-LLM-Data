i am sobbing.
sadie is barley 8am, stop making me cry 🙄🙄
wow i’m literally sobbing. oh my god this is so precious
For some odd reason, your video showed up in my feed, Sadie.  I just wanted to say, honoring your mother like this is super cool and though I don't follow you, I wanted to say how impressed I was with this video from an old, nearly 30-yr, weekly rotating, shift senior meteorologist.   My bday is coming up on 11/29 (56).  My wife Laura of almost 30 yrs turns 50 this coming May and is super mom too and selfless like yours to me,  and my two kids Aimee and Brice.   God bless and Happy Thanksgiving and Christmas ahead.

BeautifuL. thank you for sharing what a secure attachment looks like. your mom is one of the few that understands what maternal unconditional love is. bravo mom! you did exactly what healthy parenting is. allowed your child to be. exisit. refrained from judgements yet had loving boundaries and she bloomed with authenticity! that shows in her genuine love for humanity. 💗 bravo !💖 BeautifuL family. amazing video. happy birthday and good karma!
Sadie I just sobbed while watching this whole video, you’re the sweetest 🥺
😭😭😭😭😭
That was the best thing I’ve ever seen! Y’all are a great family!!

I never comment on things, but sending this to my own mom makes me cry. Mothers are the most unapologetic relationship of love you’ll ever get to experience and I’m so glad you get to feel that. I hope one day I can gift this same type of love to my mom. Thank you for being you <3

After watching this video, I caught something in my eyes too. So well done, Sadie. Happy Birthday to Mom and happiness to whole Fam.  Peace and love
Saddiiieeee I’m crying 5 seconds in
Yeah, the times have evolved to it becoming more & more acceptable or "normal" to really do anything or be anyway, live where ever or w/  whom ever, There ain't a damn thing wrong with just staying put where you were the whole time since birth. There aint nothing going on out in that world. There's nothing to see, no where to be,  No better way of being free, than to be with or to be there for the one who will always love you more,  The one who will always care,  Your adorable Momma bear. In your particular circumstance you've gotta  "Hop-momma bear" Who's very attractive for her age & that sorta thang is rare. I could go on & on with my little 2 cent yappin rappin cheap rhymes but I there's just so little time, So I stop now (just to be fair) - Take care, Bear.
martha is a mf milf, cheers to a queen
what’s the song u use

Damn fucker!…you’re such an amazing person. I’m crying like a big baby. This video made me call my mom and tell her how much I love her. Moms really are the best people in the world and they would literally do anything for you. You have an amazing mom and she’s raised 3 amazing children. You have an amazing heart and this is just another one of your videos that you’ve put out that’s really made an impact on myself and I’m forever grateful for you and the content you put out.

SADIE LITERALLY HAD ME CRYING SIX TIMES🥺🥺 this is literally the sweetest thing ever, so proud of you and Kelly and how far you’ve come❤️
I never thought I’d get so emotional over this video. My mom has been with me through everything. My ups and downs, she’s seen it all. At my lowest she was there, even when I was a complete bitch to her. When you brought up the fact that your wanted to find your own life someplace else, yet found everything you wanted with her resonated with me. I couldn’t imagine living without my mom. The fact that she is not going to be here one day breaks my heart.
i teared up sadie!!! my mom is my everything and i know that your mom loves you so much. this is so freaking adorable
So damn cute this made me cey

THE GUY ASKING WHAT SHIRT YOU’RE WEARING💀
Sadie, you made this dilf, at least that is what I am told, tear up. You are one of the sweetest and most caring people that I know, well I really don't know you, but I sure in the hell think I do because I do follow your social media's. I have had many wtf moments on some of them but I mean this from the bottom of my heart. You have the biggest heart and you truly do care, I believe for everybody. You keep on doing you Sadie!! Happy Thanksgiving to you and all of your family and also a happy belated 50th to your mom Kelly. I probably spelled her name wrong but that's ok.
kelly stans it’s our time to stand up
Sadie oh so very sweet you are. God Bless
50 years young sheesh😍 please shee is beautiful😍😍😍 happy birthday!!

Got me sobbing over here
Aww I never realized how much Kelly looked like you when she was younger
u guys have such a sweet bond
this is so sweet , made my bf and me cry ❤
What song is in the background at the beginning?!
I love this
just balled my eyes out
crying omg
I am a 27 year old mom to a 3 year old and a 10 month old.. I just cried so hard and hope to God this is the relationship I can make happen with my daughters (not the car but I want to be best friends with my girls like you and your mom are one day). Your mom is so special and she has done an amazing job raising you Sadie. This was incredible and I cried the whole time. Happy birthday Kelly!!
This is legendary Sadie
Fuck I’m balling
I’m crying, this is so sweet!
omg sadie, literally had me crying. 🥹
i’m balling
i never thought that i would cry to a sadie crowell video
she’s about to be the baddest bitch in town😂❤️❤️ hbd to your mom !
She deserves this so much and we all know it
im bawlimgggg kelly deserves this and so much more
omg sadie you really just single-handedly inspired me to change my shitty attitude towards my mom. All she does is support and love me and I feel like I’m such a bitch to her because of depression, But it really needs to stop. She’s an amazing mother and and I’m going to start showing her that
It really means a lot when I see people doing good things especially with loved ones. I lost my mom a week ago and this was the first video that I have watched and I am balling but it really helped me appreciate and be grateful for her and the memories that I cherish❤but everyone out there who is reading this go hug your loved ones whoever that is whoever you love and whoever loves you
I cried this was the sweetest thing ever. Now I know where she gets her selflessness from ❤
I am crying
this made me cry thanks sadie
Cried my eyes out
sadie u are the sweetest soul
SADIE IM AT WORK. And you’re making me cry.

Sadie!!!! I lost my mum to suicide two yrs ago and very recently, your videos have been my comfort. Watching you with your mum has been so bittersweet for me. It’s so beautiful to me that people still get this relationship with their parents and although I am in tears and envy this, I am so happy for you and so full to get to watch this and experience it from a third party. I’m in the UK so I’ve just got in from being out and I’m drunk and I clicked on this video expecting to laugh, I’m sobbing honestly f you, but also I feel so blessed to see this. Thank you for the comfort that I get from you and your family through some very dark days
MY HEART OMG 🥺🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽
That was very nice of you! Congratulations to your moms new car and happy birthday to her!
Your mom looks so happy I love this so much
