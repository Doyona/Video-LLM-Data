Idea if you ever get another mouth squishy.  Attach feet squishies to it and make a walking mouth abomination
Hi I love ur videos my sister has barret

You could turn the mouth into canine from the amazing didgial circus
Do you squeeze or turning back to the people?

👇like for her to do a people
I love your vids, you are the best and  I love your characters and yeah😊😊😊😊
I love your vids, you are the best and  I love your characters and yeah😊😊😊😊
Pls read Hi Moriah. So I had a crazy idea , why don't you make a cartoon using your characters ,like a children's cartoon it will be sooooooooooooooo good but I understand if you don't have the time and money to do it but it will be so epic .....,................... Pickle and derp can be the main character and they will have like lots of adventures😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊  pls do this idea
You have the same initials as me
Omg u should have cut mini fruid Squishies and glued them on to the inside of the mouth😭😭and u could've added big round eyes on top to give it some characterrr😭
Make Caine from the amazing digital circus🤤😛
9:15 Lol before you said that, I was also mad about the eye 😂
You could have used two feet squishes AND the mouth squishy and made it look like one of those wind-up walking mouth toys
MAKE THE TOOTHIES AS TOOTH FAIRIES LIKE TOOTHS IN TOOTH FAIRY COSTUMES
I need little big feets as a plushie right now can someone make me one (I might try to make one I love him so much he’s my child)
This was totally out of the comfort zone. Well done. The dentures were hilarious.
please do a winter color palette challenge
1:35  if you ever get another or have another you should paint Caine from The Amazing Digital Circus!! You might enjoy it
I think the dentures looks like when u wear those light up mouth pieces from the roller rink
3:30 MR POTATO HEAD DUUUH 😂❤❤❤❤
You should continue making dessert cat tooths. That way they can be sweet tooths, but cats
Teeth chomp turn cain
1:25 glue together and make them braces
Awww lil big feet’s is so small for his kind 🤭😍
he should’ve made this one  crane from amazing digital circus 9:59
MAKE CAINE PLEASE I BEG
Little Big Feets is one of my favorite characters of hers. I came back to this video just for him🧡 He's very odd, I love him
Moriah I think you should do the 24 hour challenge again!
Hiii
Im wondering how she didnt notice that she made an incorrect rainbow on the alien beanbody 😂
When she was making the tooth and told us that it look like something when she put it upside down, I thought it looked like a toto row
Just realized the feet would really go with Brr Brr Patatim
you should make a full set of the dessert cats out of the teeth where they are themed after different deserts just a thought.
Me
ɪ'ᴍ 2026
8:38  no It’s a cat+ bunny = ✨cat bunny ✨🎉  Edit: Sorry this is dumb 😅
I would love to see you paint a squishy using a negative filter
btw the squishy moriah added feet was not gudatama, it was tato. Tato is a japanese character :) (Tato Potato) hi moriah!!
maybye you should turn one of the tooth up side down and make it into a cat
Hi I love your channel because you hate Evan so much what if you re make him like you have with the face of failure and bill and peope, like that
You could make a Bigfoot squishy like Benny the squishmallow
These actually turned out really good ❤
:3
Hey Moriah. If you ever gonna make another video of fixing things i hate (no doubt the mouth is gonna be there)   Why not make it a taco?? It kinda looks like one if you tilt it and the teeth can be a salad or idkkk😀😀  Just suggesting 😊
i love weird things
9:53 NOOOOO YOU COULD’VE MADE CAINE FROM TADC! 😡
At first it was giving mr potato head
Sprinkle song...😢
Who's in 2026??
itd be so cute if she added a little tooth gem!
Make zombie squishies out of those chocolate bars
That potato is adorable 😂😂❤😊
I have one of you plushies it's  sooooo cute!!!!
Moriah should make the alien bean bodies into squishes!!
I am soooo late but I feel like for the set of teeth/ dentures whatever it is, it could have become a cream puff
The teeth could have been a desert taco
I would’ve turned the mouth one into a ice cream sandwich
Could've made the teeth a cake or like a macaroon or something. With some reshaping
O_O
Who's in August 2025?
3:16 this movie made me cry at the end😭
Turn the tooth squishies into Totoro!!
For the teeth I think you could flip them around and them turn them into lil’ cat guys!
U should have made something or someone come out of the mouth
The mouth could of been a taco
Ik its been a year but for the teeth you should do like a sweet tooth squishy
Pls give me that unicorn cat u hate plslspslslslsslslslls my adddrss i dont know bht my house is in macdonia🇲🇰i have giant treee bacmyard very close to shop close to park im kid
5:06 is my favorite
Hi Moriah  I been watching you since I was 5 I hope you have a good day
You should make a Kpop Demon Hunter squishy 😃
only moriah can take weird feet, a potato thing and random pices and turn it into a adorable alien
And I’ve been trying to make squishys too 😊😊
Can you do a unicorn micked with a cat I’m only 7 years but I’m your fan I’ve been watching you  sense I was 4 ❤❤❤❤❤  you are the best youtber
I think the last set of teeth could’ve been made into an open clam 😭
Who’s watching in 1836
I haven't watched in so long
Its a potato head!!!!!!!!!!! Not a bean body...
8:47 PEEPS ARE BUNNIES, SILLY HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
A peep is a bunny

I love this video. Can you please make more of these
You should take the feet squishies a d sstick them together to mAke a tutu. I  know it  sounds weird but trust me
the bumpy cars.... do them.
You can turn the tooth into a cat! 😊
Can you give me one of those chocolate bars that are actually film squishy’s?

The upside down tooth looked like the mini white creature from totoro!!!
Oh nvm I said that mid vid😂
Erm can I have the tooth gaw squishy…thing I have an idea😅
you could make a Mr. potato head with the feet and other squishys
I just realized she called Tayto Potato Gudetama 3:16
The creation of little big feet not my fav
Watching my favriot childhood videos with rainbows and spinkles in my mcr shirt and black coffee with death metal playing
Justice for little big feet’s
The peeps are not cats they are bunnies
11:11 ADD RAINBOW BRACES AND TOOTH GEMS AND STUFF TO DECIRATE THEM
7:29 I WANT A LITTLE BIG FEETS FAMILY USING THE OTHER FEET
How about Rainbow teeth I’m sorry
She could have made cane Digital circus fans  👇
9:50 I thought you were gonna turn the teeth into a cute little taco or something
Omg I haven’t watched Moriah since I was about 8 and now I’m almost 15…
I would love to see little big feet’s have a true name and have some merch made from him! He’s adorable and weird 🤭
She could've made Caine from TADC with the tooth and mouth squishy
Make tge teeth into caine
WE NEED MORE LIL BIG FEETSSS
You could have tried to make an ice cream sandwich.
Keep the unicorn kitty😢 please please
I I hate the teeth😢😢😢😅😅😅
Yay!
the whole jaw could’ve been oyster 😔😔😔
I LOVVEE LITTLE BIG FEETS ❤❤❤
Lil big feet is taking me out, but you should’ve made the teeth a purse
I love that cat please bring them back.
Honestly, for the tooth thingy. I think it would have been cute as a dessert purse! Like, macaroons or crepes ❤
How dare u not play the sprinkle song 🎶🤬😡😞😭
What about a sweet tooth
Can I put my hand down now cuz your memes mean nothing
moriah: questiona? anyone? me: *raises hand* moriah: put ur hand down my face: 🥺
I love those big ones
you can turn the teeth in finn the human from adventure time
tooth should have been a Totoro from ghibli
June 19 2025 what time is it for you now?
`````````ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Why don't you conbine the peach with the peach. A peach with teeth would be scary, but funny
Missed opportunity to turn the denchers into Caine from The Amazing Digital Circus 😔
Hi

Who’s in 2025

Yung first one
2025- 1:11 YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS MASSIVE
11:07 WAIT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A MACARON!
I haven’t finished the video yet but- You could turn the tooth upside down and turn it into a bunny
Hear me out tooht blobs
"Oh no, don't, don't look" WHAT
Teeth could've been turned into a macaron or maybe a clam
Pls do a part 2 and the bunny is Moriah’s sweet tooth
2:09 looks like ripoff shopkins
Make the mouth into a Oreo😊 poison, thank you😊
2026?any one
Anyone in 2025 Like this comment if you want a Burp plush also  (Start a comment bom)
YOU KNOW GUDETAMA!!!!!!! I LOVE HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Moriah does so much for us she has kids a YouTube channel and she pregnant she still makes videos for us so lets go a little low on her shouldn't we?..
Maybe she could have cut the toes and make horns???
How do I find the original video because when I looked at his channel they weren’t there
The tooth squishy when turned around looks just like Chiyo-chichi from azumanga daioh! Your version was just as cute though
R.I.P chubby potato
MORIAH!!!YOU NEED TO DO YOUR KIDS AS SQUISHES!!!!!!!
What happened to squishy roasting?
10:41 10:   😅
You could make the flip flops into mini paint pallets
Who else thinks she should shave the velvet off the velvet squishies?
*gasp* SHE SKIPPED THE SONG
AHHHHHHHHHHH I CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE OF THE FEET
#justice4bigfeets
Caine
brr brr patapim
He looks like he just witnessed WW2 7:24
The cat one was so cute i literally melted in place 😭
I've seen this squishy (the first one) in one of her videos and I love him😭😭
9:51 should’ve made it some kind of dessert.
Make braces on the mouth!!
❤ lil big feets ngl tho 😂
Looks like the potato from Toy Story 3:30
You should make a family of teeth 0:21
the dentures remind me of cain from the amazing digital circus (tadc)
Bro me
Turn the peach into a giant blob
Just a suggestion.... I know it's a year old.... but you could've made them teeth into an open sandwich... would have to do a lot of surgery but it reminds me of the anime sandwiches. SAO sandwich came first to my head.
Make a fox
Moriah you have to make a plushie of little big feeets
#❤little big feet’s
Who here also loves little big feet’s
YOU SHOULDVE MADE THE FIRST ONE THE LITTLE CREATURES FROM MARIO YOUR AUPPOSED TO JUMP ON
Make a axolotl
HI MORIAH maybe you can send me some big squishy like the peach so it can make your HOPELESS bin can be a bit smaller this is where i live, people who is not moriah pls don’t look for my own privacy. So it’s in my comments section
That former tooth squishy wasn’t a cat! That was a Totoro!
I have no idea what you’re trying to do but you should try it and let us see how you like the idea and then I can tell him what you’re going for with the idea of doing that I think you might want a different idea and I can see what you’re doing and I think that might help him with the other ideas that he can get the same ideas that he might want and I can give you yyyyy but I don’t know what to do with that idea I think you should try it out and see if you like it and see
I wish I could see in your dreams
WHO’s in 2026
LiTtLe BiG FeEtS
Drop your hand
Who thought she could make Caine from the amazing digital circus from those dentures?😁
lol the rainbiw teeth. “Taste the rainbow” 11:25
I feel like it would be cool if she made the dentures into like a monster with its mouth open
For the teeth you shud do braces
for your big set of teeth do braces!
For teeth, you could cut off the little bottom part and use them for corns on a different squishy maybe😮
WE NEED A DERP BERGER!!!!!!!!!!!!🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔
If U ever get any more mouth squishies U could carve out the inside big where U painted the rainbow and replace it with a pearl squishy and carve  the gum and teeth to look like a shell🎉🎉
3:15 oh! Is this gudetama? Nope it’s Tayto!
Name one of ur characters lokie
I HATE LITTLE BIG FEETS.. it's the mix of muted and bright colours that just isn't working.. Please fix him in another episode!
The first one should be called. ‘Bean Feet!’ 😂
YOU SHOULD MAKE THE TEETH ONE INTO CAINE FROM THE AMAZING DIGITAL CIRCUS!!! IT'D BE SO CUUUUTE
10:08 idk why but i see a stretched oreo there😂
Nobody is in 2o24 ya dummbo
if u got rid of the back block and added more teeth the teeth couldv been a muffin or cupcake or one of those oreo muffin burger thingies. i feel like it alr looks more like a dessert than teeth
No sprinkle song!!!😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
No sprinkle song!!!😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Do the big one
You should do Mr.potato head from Toy Story with the feet
I hate to break it to you but that is not a cat
#weneedthesprinklesong
Little big feets is perfect and amazing and deserving of love
I am in 2025
Me
When you turn the teeth around, they kind of have the form of the chibi totoro!
3:42 I have that squishy cat unicorn <3 When I was younger, one of my dogs ripped the head and tail off, so I used nail polish to put it together, because I was so inspired by this channel, and I wanted to do squishy make overs-
I know she should make the peach as a nofilgion fruit
Moriah you should do a me🩷 custom crayon box
THE TOOTH COULD BE A TOTORO
You know with your big tooth squishy like the big one you can turn it into a taco because it shaped like a taco and you can try make it into a taco
The mouth could be a taco if you turn it and add toppings
Why did you show it in pastel rainbow?
Turning a tooth into a cat is so creative!!
i just realised rewatching this that peach could maybe be jerry?..yk the cherryyy he could finally get his spot light and it'd be an easier design
My ideas when first introduced, the feet could be like noodles if you found a bowl shape and the MOUTH like the teeth set can be maybe like a cake sliding around (giving aurora‘s cake ykwim) idk I haven’t finished the video and Ik it’s a year later
someone help and spread this message!!!! the british government is taking peoples right to disabled benefits (PIP) and causing people the need to leave their homes or go hungry because they can't afford to live. the labour party promised a better future but has done nothing to help and have made matters worse. we are stuck in a corrupted, money hungry, cruel world and the only thing we can do is hope that things will take a turn quickly.
I love you and the body
Pastel
A pick pumpkin
i
2:17
IDEA FOR THE PEACH ONE, what if u make it the planet of naphalaphagus? or a planet in the blob universe ,
who's in 2098?
I like the teeth redesign
Could’ve turned the mouth into a standing dessert taco 🌮
With a small feet you could do an outline of your kids’s foot when they were first born you know how hospital stamped the babies foot and hand
I feel like you always have to trust the process with her videos ❤❤
I would have put wings on the tooth and made it a fairy
I see a Mokke 8:34
1:36 I think you can put something and make it look like a jungle mushroom
I've been watching u for 4 years!!
for the full set of teeth, A CLAM.
I LOVE LIL BIG FEETS I WANT HIMMM
I would've made a macaron from the teeth

The teeth would make fantastic totoros and mini totoros.
Dude when I taw the chatter teeth I yelled out “CANE” from the amazing digital circus lol
the set of teeth maybe couldve been an oyster with a pearl inside if you hollowed it out a bit?
For the tooth one I just wanted to give a suggestion what if you create like a sweet tooth and it’s like a pastel rainbow with a bunch of little sweet things on it I think that would look cute
Turn the dentures sideways and make it a dessert taco
Should put all the teeth togwther im a stack so its a corn cob
8:35 looks like the little white and littler grey guy in totoro
1:49 cane. Digital circus. It’s perfect.

The rainbow fluffy ball with a horn is a rainbow puppycorn
I need a video of pickles family tree
Pickle family tree when
Are you pregnant
So this is over a year old, but could we maybe get Little Big Feet's merch? I love him!! ❤
Tbh I think I have the opposite style to Moriah as an artist bc I genuinely think making the teeth creepy and realistic would be funny. Like maybe have a gold tooth and a silver crown, or in various stages of off white to yellow to cavity ridden
You should make different versions  of Disney characters on your squishes.
oh hi
Never mind who is in 2025
You should give the feet to 🏋️🐥 lol
You look like amy sosa
3:14 he reminds me of a small mini mango Moriah made back then
You could’ve make  Caine
Put the teeth in the peach and make a funny blob
00.57 if U want to skip the intro here😊

for the teeth you should have added a cute strawberry or something that it's biting down on, or does that sound weird
who's here in 2030
Me
My friend told me she was the one who sent the mouth. I didn’t believe her until she showed me the squishy in old photos. I watched the video and I believe it was actually her.
The teeth that you did last.. you could have made into a seashell...or a jewelry box, jewelry gift box or a waffle with filling...or those were the images that came to my mind when I saw them....😅😅
JUSTICE FOR LITTLE BIG FEETS🎉🎉🎉
If you get another Mouth Squishy and you happen to have a larger squishy, you should combine them. Give a poor large squishy some dentures.
Alien Bean body 😂😂😂😂😂😂  6:21 👽
Hi
Should've made rainbow teeth.😂😂
The mouth turned out good...although I think you could have also have painted the gums in a bread crust color and some sesame seeds on top (like a bread bun or roll) with burger patty and lettuce, tomato etc filling - as a really weird mouth burger!
i am in 2025
the teeth set could be remade and had grillz on them!! with gold or silver paint or with like other metallic colors or even just rainbow grillz!!
Why dont you turn the teeth into a dessert taco

2:43 THE INITIALS

Little big feet’s is so cute but weird at the same time

1:10 yknow what else is massive?
Isn’t just me or do I think the set of teeth could’ve been some sort of fluffy macaron
im so late to this but you couldve put the gum teeth squishy to the side and made a pastry, the teeth being like bits of whipped cream and the gums being the cake and put some strawberries in the middle
PLEASE do a dragon. I LOVE dragons, especially cute dragon, and I really like Wings of Fire. so PLEASE DO A DRAGON. They AWESOME. PLEASE, DO IT.
Turn them into a among us character in your style
if i had to do something with the teeth, i would make them into a crown
You could totally make a Totoro squishy out of one of the teeth!!!!
Watching kn1%
6:58 why does it look like a Furby?
Big peach squishy = big pumpkin
Oh my God it's the Giant peach I remember that when you got that so long ago
You could’ve made the teeth into a taco!😠🦷🦷🦷🌮
Little Big Feet’s needs to have toe nails
Maybe  use tooth squishies as cats if u  turn them around it makes two ears and four limbs
0:56  not me thinking there were gonna be way more then that 💀 ( it’s not my fault cause she does have a lot of squishies!! 👀
Defeat kind of look like squid And when you flip it around, it looks like it has a butt cheek🤣🤣 You could make a set with them or if you have a extra make one galaxy or something like that that would be cool
I would turn the teeth into Caine from the amazing digital circus
It looks like the play or die guy
Who’s in 2898 ❤
Do u know caine? Its from tadc. Hes a bit creepy but u can make the teeth set him plssss
NOOOOOO😫😩😖😣😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 4:38
I want, no, NEED A LIL BIG FEET SHIRT 😢
Am I wrong to like the full teeth one best?
9:06 le gasp no sprinkle song?!?!?!?
U can make little cats of the teeth if u turn them upsidedown
I got pb
7:45 I can see ONLY Totoro(s) or bunnies😂😂😂or Mokke (Hanako-kun)
You could’ve turned the set of teeth (with the inflamed gums) into some sort of lizard!
1:35 feel like the teeth could be super cute mini cats!
10:37 in my head this would work but imagine the gums as a thick cracker,the teeth as marshmallows,and the middle part chocolate with a hidden character painted on to it so it looks like the design of the chocolate
Make the tooth a sweet tooth 😂🍭🍬
Your character teeth
2:09 theese are cute
1:22  I know I had theese when I was young My mom bought me it because I was at the dentist I gave it then a friend to borrow she broke it :(
Are  you pregnant hu hu yeah hello
Those teeth upsidedown would be perfect for My Neighbor Totoro Bois ❤️❤️🌿🍄🌲
Who's in 2025?
I love little big feets.
Who here in 2025
you have to make a peep sqiushy
use the peach to make a fruit bowl. cut it in half and put fruit in it
Where’s the sprinkle song 😢😢😢
You can make a burger out if it
I love the calico cat (no one will talk about that it’s a tooth instead 😂)
Your fun but your obsession with food annoys me. Srry
Hey I know it's a little (like a year) late on ideas but you could paint the teeth as frogs with the points of the teeth as the eyes.
You should put the teeth upside down and make em into kitties
Up down up down all together now mr potato is rolling around 4:49
Me
Sprinkles song
10:56 u could have done a cake
I'm utterly disappointed at the fact when you put sprinkles on the tooth cat there was no sprinkle song, although the rest of this SLAYED!
I love you and same for my friends and my mom
small fetes
Little feet
2025 BABYYYY
The teeth turned upside down kinda looks like Totoro from Studio Ghibli
The fact her hands arent constantly covered in paint is surpring😂i couldn’t not make a mess while painting if my life depended on it lol
who’s in 2025
You know how in the dentist office they have fake teeth and a toothbrush to practice with, what if moriah painted the set of teeth to look like that with mini squishys as her characters brushing the teeth, it would be a cute way to decorate it . Side note, Moriah your the best person ever, it makes me so happy seeing you every week, and thank for bringing me so much joy. Also #justiceforevan
No Sprincal song 😢
Whos in 2025❤

Hi
3:35 it's not guedetamaaa!!! It's tayto the potato!!!
So you know the set of feet you could put all your fav characters on the teeth  ( just a suggestion) ps: I love your vids
Hello Moriah A Little idea: if you cut a tooth in half and flip ohne side you coud maybe make a Lightningbolt? Maybe cuter than a tooth
THE SPRINKLE SONG😭😭
Is💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💰💰💶💶 she still in her office filming to get money 💵 to buy her new house 🏠🪪💵💵💵💵💰💰💰💰💵💵💵💰💸🪙💶💷🎉🎉🎉
The people of nafalafagus have alien bean bodies for farm animals to plant shadow berrys
If you flip the tooth upside down, it could look like a cute cat (maybe)
On the set of teeth you could give it braces
The baby bottle please 🙏
(\_/) ( •.•) (>❤
can you make a rainbow something
MORIAH! For the feet squishes make the toe nails the rainbow colors or just do fun themes like if you want to make it even more instesting use the spinning wheel and put themes on it then whatever you get that’s the toe nails theme😅😂😊 I know this is weird but it’s just a random idea that popped into my head
❤hi
You could’ve made the mouth squishy into some weird possessed hamburger.i
People who are not dead yet?
i think the teeth are for like kids in a dentist office
For the denture squishy you could have mad it a cute sea shell/clam!
Can we have more of the fingers down my spine
More idea for the tooth, you could make it an amongus ,or if you turn it upside down you could make the small Totoro out of it(from my neighbour Totoro)
Is girl the squishy teeth tooth fairy?😂
hey im from nc in i love your videos and i think you shoulod do a tar heal foot
You could totally make the foot into a cute little flip flop charm!
What about the sprinkle song?
She did desert and cat with the tooth
You should turn that big peach into jerry the cherry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Omg you could make the chocolate bar ones little Sabrina carpenters. You even have all of the right colors to match her three chocolate bar shaped perfumes !!!!
hey i love your vids
I have an idea for the chocolate squishies you can make them into your favorite chocolates the logo the color and details
Little feet😂 also where is the sprinkle song🤨😡 this was posted a year after this vid came out lol
9:07 how dare you not do the sprinkle song😡😡😡
I like the sweet tooth kitty 🥰
Moriah, I really like the idea of making the chocolate bars a couple 😅 And maybe in the future, you might get a little chocolate bar, and you could make the chocolate bar couple a child 😅 I love your videos! ❤ Keep up the great work! ❤

You could have gave the teeth a rainbow cavity 🦷❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
i think the mouth one looks nice
Could you make the calico cat into an actual dessert?
1:56 it needs a grill!!
For the tooth one, you could add wings and a wand to make it a tooth fairy! And you could make it as cute as you want, so if you’re willing to dig back 8nto that pile of teeth. You might as well make one a tooth fairy!
I have an idea for the feet squishies! You can make a dancer, with 2 left feet! (Or 2 right feet depending on what side you wanna do lmao)
The rainbow grill cheese sandwich is NYAN CAT! THE TOOTH THINGIE ATE NYAN CAT!!!!
Make it an oyster
You’re inspired me ❤
You should turn your blobs into squishes
Lil big feet’s is my one true love of her squishy collection idk why-
I feel like the teeth would be better for horror artists ?, only thing I can think to do with em is make em decaying and gross ? How do you make teeth cute and pastel characters you like to make lol x

Turn the mouth into some kind of dessert sandwich

Only real Moriah fans can like this
Ngl little big feet’s is actually kinda cute ☺️
WHAT TIME IS THE GUIDE BOOK ARRIVING IN 2025?!!!!!
For the mouth one at the end, I think you should’ve made a hole in the middle and put one of the chocolates in it and then glue like a sock on it and then put face and it would be cute. I think.
Who thought that the teeth squishy could be among us or is it just me?
Are you pregnant 🤰
This is just a funny idea for a halloween prompt but using the fake set of teeth as a reference.. for a giant squishy like the peach, to shape it out and then use the teeth squishies to put inside of said shape
Big feets is what they call big foot in invader zim also love your art
Cool
You should have turned the teeth into a clam with a pearl in it.
11:07 you could have turned it into some kind of taco like a Chaco Taco for example
Why no sprinkle song😢
The tooth squish just make it upside down paint it in to a bunny BAM
not to be dramatic but i would die for little big feets
Me
I put my Hand up😅
Mariah, you could do a taco with the jaws the teeth
did she ever end up decorating the peach?
hello, on the last one, you could've removed the middle part of the dentures and cut the teeth into sharper teeth and made it a vampiric type of effect
PLS bring back the advent calendar 😢 ❤ I love your videos I have been watching sense I was two and I really want the advent calendar for Christmas it would be my favorite year ever if you see this please restock the advent calendar ❤
you should do a video on just the giant squishies
I Would of put the tooth squishy onto the peach squishy and made a jacky-style monster thing! (:
You need to make a kitten tooth collection
You need to make a kitten tooth collection
The big tooth could've been a dinosaur head lmao
Hiii
I think the teeth could have rainbow braces
Honestly, i bet someone has made a Caine head out of the denture squishy
Who else is in 2507
I think you should put those big denture teeth inside one of your massive peach squishies and make it another alien blob
LITTLE BIG FEETS❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
7:26 i think his name is bum bum or something tbh
For the tooth squishys you could make them all Bunny's but different flavors and deserts like strawberry or chocolate!!
Liiittle big feetssssss
I thought she was gonna turn the set of teeth into fangs. Like for an animal or vampire
You could make the mouth squishy into a giant sea shell with a pearl inside
You can make one of the tooth's a tooth fairy 🧚‍♀️ ✨️
A mr potato head squishy would be so cool to make!!
5:17 very cutesy feet🎀
Turn the teeth into a packman
Mr POTATO 4:48
Put the teeth inside a big squishy! like the peach
YOU COULD MAKE A SWEET TOOTH, A TOOTH FULL OF SWEETS AND RAINBOWS
I wish you added the feet to a duck squishie and made them ducky feet
Can you do a makeover for a huge squishy?
There was no sprinkle song 😢😢😢😢😢.
Maybe chain from the digital circuit

Hi
I hate the teeth 😂
i love the bean body creature! as someone with huge feet, it’s so whimsical & i love it’s face :)
7:32  two words… GIMME HIM
Name the cat Lucy
Hello again. I watched this video after a year, and this came up with another idea, should you ever have to work with a whole set of teeth again. You could make it something completely different by cutting it together so that it takes a new shape, like a piece of cheese or a pie. It could be little figures sticking out of it, or two feet. ^^
Honestly fur the mouth I personally had 2 ideas. 1 taco, put it in its side. 2 macaron, “but it’s got that flat side-“ easy. Cut that side roughly to look like someone had a big ol bite. The gaps even big enough in between the teeth that with some foam chunks, and/or some thick puffy paint you could fill it with cream.
8:40 that could be totoro-
8:36  I was thinking of Totoro 🥲
2024??                                     👇👇👇
Moriah, I LOVE your squishies and how you think creatively to make something and how you use your imagination
Do the hopeless ben please 🙏 I also love you're videos 📹 ❤️ ♥️
Why did you not do the sprinkle song😢😢😢😭
itsoundslikepuppypaint
The first one could've been Mr Potato head with his enormous feet 😭
Cat + Peep = Patp 😊😊
Hey moriah can you paint your art room

BRO PUT BRACES ON THE TEETH I have braces so that would be amazing
Click this button 👇if you think she should've used the teeth of Kane from The Amazing digital circus

She makes everybody laugh. I love her give her 10,000 likes and then she will probably do that video that we never saw in grave comment 200 viewers.

That molar makeover was magnificent
You forgot about the sprinkle song on the second squshy
i LOVE the tooth cat please re-make it into a real cat squishie i beg
Mariah flip the drenches over and you have a sweet taco  This is just an idea

8:37 if you have watched Gabby's Dollhouse you'll notice that the cat moriah imaged is the same cat that they use in Gabby's Dollhouse (most of the times) hope you found this helpful 😊
I am now hi
+🦷=😻or 🐰
you should turn the dentures into a cookie sandwich 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
The upside down teeth remind me of the mini trolls from Totoro!
You should’ve made the potato a bunny tbh
I would buy small feet😊 EDIT: I DON’T THINK I’VE WATCHED THIS VIDEO YET IDK WHERE THIS COMMENT CAME FROM😭 I WOULD NEVER BUY FEET SQUISHYS😅
If you dont like it give then to me cuz their weird and im weird😀
You should make a whol world of nofulofuguss with all the cariktors like a skulpture
2:07  U ALREADY DID ONE OF THESE!! THE MOVIE BESTIES!!!!
RAINBOW GRILLED CHEESE DOES EXIST!!🎉❤
You could’ve made the teeth like clam with a peal with a face inside
❤
I LOVE LOL BIG FEETS😂😂😍😅😅😋
Could u please put colorful braces onto the rainbow teeth
The Alien bean bodie made me think of a wierd hobbit pet thing
I’m OBSESSED with lil big feet’s!❤️❤️❤️
On the teeth, you should’ve done all of your squishy creations in the middle so it would look like a show
I was so devastated when Moriah didn't include the Calico Cat squishy in her Guide Book, 😢😢 Hope she adds them soon...
Her and doctor squish  should  collab
You should take a bunch of tiny squishes and put them on a stick and make like kebabs or maybe some Tanghulu sticks or some dongo sticks!!
You should take a bunch of tiny squishes and put them on a stick and make like kebabs or maybe some Tanghulu sticks or some dongo sticks!!
i need the big unicorn one
2024???
For the whole tooth/mouth squishy, you should make it into a cave and the opening of the mouth could be a sunrise
The teeth ones looks like a bunny if you hold it upside down 😮
I think if you turn those teeth upside down they could be good for small totoros. Or whatever those really small spirits from Totoro are called.
You have to give the mouth a face
The feet with the egg thing would have made a good Mr.potatohead too
Alien beanbody that got rejected and sent across dimensions 4:59
You should take the teeth, flip em over and make em cathes teeth cats!!
Hi Moriha i love you're vids they always make me happy even in the though moments❤
OH MY GOSH ITS A TOTORO BEING
maybe a cat with the teeth!??
6:44 furby
9:45  can you turn it into a plushy I want it 😂❤
I love the alien bean bodies and i love little big feets but also i swear he already existed
you shouldve given the tooth wings and made it a little tooth fairy 😭😭
the  upside down tooth looks like on of the guys from my naybor totaro
Hi Elizabeth you are the best I’ve been watching you for seven years❤🧡💛💚💙💜💖🫶🏻
I want More bean bodies I love the funkyness
I need a bean body
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
As a foot doctor, I love these foot squishy’s
“They’re ugly”  Isn’t that why it’s called a makeover 🧍🏻‍♀️
Little big feet is now my new favorite character😢
I would make it a clam guy 11:09
With the dentures i thought she could turn it into a taco somehow, either way it turned out better than expected
I have that same tooth squishy the one with the pink headband I got from the tooth fairy and they
Its a bunny
The teeth maybe could have been turned into a waffle dessert taco :)
With the two squishes make them animals
Thet jork is cute
Its cute
Moriah I am a fan of u but the tooth looked like a amongus
Little big Feets is cute
There's shopkins
9:13 THE SPRINKLE SONG
YOU FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG FOR THE TOOTH CAT
i need more of little big feet i love him
Omg my friend has that one u used for the horns and the ears of the alien bean😂
Ok not going to lie but at first I thought little big feet looked a bit like a Furby but I love them!
Why did I think it looked like Winnie the poo before the paint job
If you have little teeth squishies then you can have something hold it and it can be a tooth fairy squishy.
You should cover the top of a tooth with frosting and sprinkles and call it a sweet tooth!
YOU NEED TO MAKE A COLLECTION OF TOOTH KITTIES MORIAH
I LOVE  Moriah elizabeth!
that peach is a gyatttttt
I have the same potato squishy it's  called tato
The teeth should be tacos but it's ok
hi its my birthday 11th september and i baught one  of yours and i got pickle the green dinosour
No sprinkle song on the tooth/cat 😭
I love Little Big Feetss
So cute ❤😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I really wanted to see rainbow braces on the set of teeth
i swear this video came out yesterday
Please BAKE again PLEASE!!!!
the tooth one should have braces 😝
Her name is homberger
Your slow this time
I beg please use the massive peach and stick a little man/bear or something on top and make a cutesy version of James and the giant peach!! That would be so cool
The pigmented giant unicorn needs to be protected at all costs
You could make a taco with the teeth the mouth one
I would've added a windup and the feet to the dentures squishy, make it that wierd teeth chattering windup toy from toy story!
with the fruit she should make a fruit from the planet she made up
with the fruit she should make a fruit from the planet she made up
Puppy paint????
For the teeth you can turn them into cats or like desert teeth! (Idk about desert teeth you decide)
BIG FOOT FEET🤪
MORIAH YOU FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG FOR THE TOOTH CAT
Missed opportunity for braces on the full set of teeth. Would have loved to see the rainbow braces....
I think that was Gudetama because he didn't have the but
9:49 missed opportunity to turn that into Caine from TDAC.
You could(ve) made the tooth and mouth one into cane from The amazing digital circus
Ugh I need a realistic and bloody tooth squishy in my life now edit: totally unrelated question. Do you do commissions?
You can use the sprinkle song for the cat bunny tooth thingy 😮
You are a murderer, you keep murdering.Repeat you keep taking people's parts to repair your squeezes
Yhey are so cute!
I think you should call there being body little feets😂😂
Moriah Elizabeth bring spark  out again!!!!
I want to send you some  squishy’s and I can not do that because I don’t know were you live and I have a lot of them that need help so pls help me
Omg i totally forgot about her but she is so my comfort YouTuberrr
You could turn the mouth into a bao bun! Or taco or choco-taco  maybe
You could make a gender reveal set with the feet or a Bigfoot!
She should do this video series again x
Oh my gosh the teeth upside down look like totoro! I wanna make that now lol
I thought you could have turned the mouth into a macaroon
Do a Fred baby squishy
even if you are not in love with little big feets, I certainly am!
Make a rainbow teeth set🌈🦷
For the tooth squishy I was thinking those little tiny creatures in Totoro
Ik this isn’t ur style but maybe for the teeth u could make it into a weirdcore type squishy (eyes in the mouth, gums a weird colour, blood on the teeth?)  (Btw ik im very late I js wanted to say that)
for the mouth with teeth squishy u can turn it into a shark jaw and put lil sea creatures inside
U can give the teeth set thing a pair of grills
Não mostra pra  Disney  aquela  coisa  que  parece um  mural
Today
I love the cat tooth ❤
The chocolate people are actually a character from the Shopkins
❤❤❤❤❤🦄🦊🐹🏔🌏🗽🎄🎃
For the dentures you can probably make it to caine from the digital circus
Heya! I’ve made some Alien BeanBodys! Would you like me to send a drawing of them and you can try to make them into squishies for your character collection? I need your address to do this, so… 😅😅😅😅
Please do the big peach
SPRINKLE SONG
The teeth look like little among us characters
Big feets <3
Hey, I love your video. You should have made every tooth of the mouth a different design.
Hey, I love your videos. You should have made every tooth of them mouth. A different design or a different color.
make a video about painting all your teeth squishies and I love your video!
The upside down tooth looks likw Totoro and you could have made a sweet tooth
Rainbow braces……
SPRICKLE SONG!?
It looks so cute to be painted
I would never get tired bean body😂
If you get another dentures squishy you could make Caine from tadc
No sprinkle song 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Me seeing the teeth: OH MY GOD ITS CAINE FROM TADC!!
You could try a gold tooth or grills
You should have made the mouth of teeth into a taco!
Hiii Moriah! U could make the peach into the nofalofagus planet!!! ( if u want)
You didn't do the sprinkle song
Moriah should make a map of Nahfalafagos!  (not forcing her to, just a suggestion!)
Hii! me and my friends  love ur videos ❤😊
The tooth looks like the white bunny from TOTORO!
I love tooth cat
OMG!! You should have made a whole bunch of tooth fairrys , using the teeth!!
Where is the sprinkle song
It’s a marshmallow dessert kitty, her name shall be mello-dy
paint fethers in a set
Can u make a movie of all your squishes makeovers?
Mariah well done on 10 million so I give you ooga Booga hygge Luger😂🎉🎉🎉🎉 please do a cotton candy blob from the blob universe
Me too 😅
i love the first one and she should've done bluetooth for the second one
That's  not  godatoma it's tayto potato so now  I am mad at you
the first bigfoot guy reminds me of a character from My Singing Monsters! he would fit perfectly among them
SHE FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG!
You can put a hole in your biggest squishy or one of them and put the set of teeth in the hole
You should have done a treashure chest with teath
So what I think you should name the hamburger penguin?ham Gwen
Hello Moriah! My daughter had a great idea for your tooth squishy collection when watching this video! We felt it was a very “Moriah-like” idea: A dessert themed set of teeth - called your Sweet Tooth Collection!   Hopefully this inspires you to be a little more excited about working with them at some point in the future.  Also, a very belated Congrats!! to you and your expanding family! ( i am copy and pasting this so maybe she sees it! Ill take it down if @easterbunnyreject536 wishes)
The cat is so cute despite its odd shape! I have some ideas for you!  1. Paint a squishy from the mini squishy box  2. Unbox mystery blind bags/boxes and paint on whatever’s inside!  ❤️I love your videos
THERE WAS SIX FEET!!!
Mommy the mouth is soo big and u made it sooo beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Stop not stip
If I stip watching Moriah Elizabeth I'll die
Perfect opportunity to make the mouth a taco
DO A SQUISHY COWBOY RIDING A UNICORN
Turn inviv teeth upside down. Bunny squishier :)
With the bean body and the feet, it looks like Mr. potato head😂😂😂😂😂😂
I ❤ big Feets!!! I feel like u could've done some dessert sandwich thing for dentures tho... all in all quite funny....😂😂
Put the teeth in the peach!!!!!!
was anyone else sad the sprinkles song wasn't played during the painting of the tooth cat? lol
Moriah elizbeth
Thé mouth should have had pickle and derp look out!!!!! if that makes sense
Could have made that cricked cake from sleeping buety. When the fairy godmother were making a birthday cake. Could have made that out of the mouth.
If you don't want them. I'll take them develop it one I love those
You should do this again until you finish all the squishes you’ve been avoiding
I like the name lil big feets 😊 but but i dont like him self
Commenting on every single one of your videos until I get pinned I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS 4/470
I JUST REALIZED U COULD GIVE MUSCLE CHICKEN BETTER FEET
The "tooth"  kitty
Dude, the big ones unicorn.
Just saying, you could’ve added faces on the teeth for the last one
11:10, I feel like it should be some sort of nofalogian sculpture in one of their city’s, the very ancient rainbow grill cheese teeth, 0w0
WE WANT A SWEET TOOTH COLECTION WITH UR LEFT OVER TEETH PLUSHIES
Pls girl give me one l will subscribe and like
How do you make everything CUTE?! Teach me.
YOU FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG !!!!!!!!!
Moriah should paint an entire outfit again!
wow
wow
You didn’t Play the sprinkle song😭😢😭😢😭😢😭
for the chocolate u should do the chocolate shopkins
1. with the teeth(whole mouth) you can make caine from digital circus!! 2. squishy roasting: your so ugly moriah cant even fix you(moriah fixes everything thats squishy)
7:31 The sun shined on him looks like tears
With the set of teeth she could have done caine from the amazing digital circus🤡🎪
11:18 is me and the bros
With the teeth you could of made the tooth fairy can you do that next time you get a tooth squishy please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please
PLEASE SAY SOMEONE ELSE SAW THE TEETH AND THOUGHG OF CAINE FROM TADC
Can you make one of the teeth a bunny?
PLEASE MAKE A HUMAN SQUASHY
She should have cut the peach and put the mouth in and made it a creature
8:28 it’s…. Totororto✨I CANT SPELL TOOOODAYYY✨
Ok but why is big feets one of my favorite characters.. like that she's ever made
9:30 CUTIE!!
Lil big feet looks like a type of monster out of, my singing monsters
Do the sprinkle  song
Its a bunny!!!!!!!!!
I love little big feets
She didn’t do the sprinkle song!! 😱🥺
Why don’t you sell the dentures someone who actually likes them?
I like your be bodies, the bright colors and cute little faces, but this one no no
Oh oops I commented before she said that
The teeth upside down looks like a bunny
I am your biggest fan
Can you do more videos? Small cupcake videos.
Can you do more videos?
I I got one of your squishy the cupcake one
like if you think her art is amazing ⭐
I look like the first one you made in the video 😂
Moriah you should turn a tooth squishy into a Gudetama squishy. Like in your own style like maybe candy or rainbow themed instead
Do more squishes that you have been avoiding pls pls pls pls pls PLEASE
now we use puppy paint lol
You should do goody Tomine next😊😉☺️
Shut up ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When she turned the tooth squishy upside down I immediately saw small Totoro. All she had to do was add some simple eyes and it would be done.
the big peach could be turned into jerry the cherry because of the crack in the back
You can make  Caine with the mouth
For some of the teeth you can do people and craft or steal arms
I’M SO MAD THAT SHE DIDN’T DO THIS! (jk moriah love you😂) Moriah should have used the big red bow (which is currently on the grateful monkey) and put it on the blob gutatama thing to make fish blob! The downside though is that the grateful monkey wouldn’t exist.  If you think Moriah should have done this: 👇
Im gonna buy one of your back packs
Dentures could have been a shell
You need to bring back little big feet in other videos because he’s kind of cute
the giant ones must be next
I'm going to school 😢😢😅 By!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😊😊❤❤
Feet😮tooth🐇
I feel betrayed that she didn’t play the sprinkle song
Tbh when I was looking at the feet squishies I couldn’t help but think that they might make good fins for some type of fish. So maybe that could work?
I just got a derp plushy for my Big W stor and I love him ❤
Love the teeth squishy cause my mom is a dentist and she has one of those
Make the peach a big bootay...
I think you should call it Burglin
99.9M subs when im  watching 😂
Pls do more if you can’t or don’t want to I’m fine with that
I have a idea for the feet squishies,cut the toes off of two and put them together like a yin yang
The tooth would become a cat when the tooth is upside down
i laughed so hard when you put the feet on the potato also why take the cutest thing and make it so weird it makes it cute in a way some how
Did anyone notice that she didn't use the sprinkle song!
ThE BiG BoYS
7:22 I love the ._. Face 😂😂
i thought you were going to trim down the teeth and make it a rainbow 😭 but they were very cute teeth
Moriah how do I send squishy
I want to paint the denture squshie. Only a couple would know. ;)
also is your character blob a brand because i also have one named blob and i want to make mine a brand when i grow up
i watch you almost every weekend just for some time i don't watch you i will see if i have subbed to you if not i'll do so
You’re right person who said watching her never gets old
NEW IDEA: For the nafalogian woodland creatures, she uses colors she does not like that much and adds even weirder parts. (Example little big feets) But for the nafalogian creatures/townsfolk, she uses nice colors she loves and not that strange body parts.(Example bops)
MORIAH PLEASE give little big feets a girlfriend   Please!!!
I love your videos❤
🦵🤠🦶
make the teeth into tottoro! (no forceing u)
Little
"my mans not gonna be a foot model" got me rolling on the floor
I am sending you teeth now
She could have made the GUMS a Sea shell :(
𝙸 𝚕𝚘𝚟𝚎 𝚢𝚘𝚞𝚛 𝚟𝚒𝚍𝚎𝚘  ♡✰ツ⠒̫⃝
I think you should do another video like this only with one of each category. Please like if you agree! 😊
The set of teeth had so much potential 😭😭 The inside could have been some sort of food, and I thought her characters as tooth gems would be so cute.
PLSSSSSSSSSSS MAKE THE ALIEN ONE  A PLUSHIEEEEE!!!!!! I WOULD BUY IT IN A SECOND
I think with some modifications, the teeth could be turned into a clam or a tacos.
I understand why you were ovoiding the ones  you were ovoiding my name is layla
Hey Moriah, I was wondering where you get your paint that you use to paint the squishy. I've been looking for paint that isn't thin and doesn't crack, but I can't find any that will actually work. Thank You.🙂
Make a mouth out of all the teeth (if u want)
I ❤ the caattt
Every. Time. I see dentures i think of Caine from tadc
🎶little bigfeetss🎶
There was no sprinkle song 😢😢
WE NEED A LIL BIG FEETS PLUSHIE NOWWW PLEASE I NEED IT😢
THAT IS NOT GUDATAMA DON'T  EVER SAY THAT.
U could make the teeth into my neighbour totoro
hey girl do you even know what a peep is?? NOT a cat
😂❤
Im watching your videos for school(half way skipping, halfway doing spanish cuz of the subtitles)
For the feet I was thinking rainbow! There were six of them.
Moriah listen to me the  tooth cats name should be Sunday
Little big feets is now one of my favorite characters of yours. ITS SOO CUTE!!!!!
For the mouth I would of put it on the back of the mouth and made it a taco
2024?
HIII ME I think that u should have made the first potato like squishy into mr.potato from Toy Storie
I discovered Moriah when I was 9 now I’m 15 still watching her
Okay I think that we should put a challenge on Mariah let's see if she is going to do another one of those hopeless been projects
I love Mr big feets
When I seen the gums flipped I thought you would’ve made it into some sort of taco that’s what I was thinking !
What if you make your characters on the tooth squishy 😂
A bunny with a slight but crack
Not the potato! He was so cute!
I hate the teeth aaaaaaaaah I can't even look at them anymore mmmmmmmmmh 10:14
IF U WERE MY I WOULD MAKE THE TOOTH SQUISHEES TOTOROS AND THE JAWS CAINE
if you turn the denture squishy to the side, you could’ve turned it into a taco
for the teeth u can do umongus!!!!🥴
I LOVE 1.
I ❤ uoenicorn
I got an ad exactly after you said “ I think this would be a good idea for…” and that as said dramatically “war.”
Make a whole set of teeth with all the individual teeth lol
I love little big FEETsssss
MAKE AMUNGUS
give the teeth a griLL
No, you could’ve turned it into Kane for the amazing digital Circus
Paint fish toys  but only light blue's you can and orange eyes
I love all of them they are so CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (like if you agree)
I have a question.. if I paint a squishy then will the paint chip off if I squish it?
The Way I Would Create Each Squishy ————————————————————  1:00  Massive Unicorns ——> Horses  1:16   Peach ——> apple  1:20  Teeth —-> each one is a lil cat   1:37 Mouth ——> cain from Digital Circus  1:59  feet squishys —-> Ghost with a dress  2:06  Chocolate bar people ——> recreate it   2:16  Velvet squishies ——-> RECREATE THEM
hm you should  make a bear with  a tooth and our fellow body part donors Who totally want to donate their body, meh I think its a good idea also a bunny
I’m I the only person that loves little big feets
Day 4 of asking pls paint on paint pls ❤❤❤❤
No not gudetama with ugly feet😭😭😭
Why not name the bean alien guy "Little foot"? It might work🤷
No sprinkle song😢😡🤬
If I was you I would have used the feet as ears
😢help😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
For the first one I kept shouting mrs.potato head squishy😂
I can’t even touch velvet imagine it as a squishy 😭😭
Moriah  why did you not make a character riding a. Unicorn
5:52 homestuck
"WhAt ThE HeCk Is ShE TaLiNg AbOuT?"😂😂😂😂lol
😂😂🤣😊 Alien being body that is so funny😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🥲🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🤪😜😝😅😂🤣🥲🤣😂😂😅😅😂🤣🥸
I agree did They do look like big feet squishy’s😂😂😂😂😮😅😂😂😂
I love unicorns❤
You can turn the tooth upside  down and turn it into a  cat♡ DAMN YOU THOUGHT IT TOO!!?
Make a bunny forest of teeth
Omg this girl is so talented!!! ❤❤
Why did you ruin a perfect potato into that!?!?!?!!!!???
The bean body guy is like a nofologian squirrel!
people that think moriah should make paper squishies 👇🏻
Poop
You should totally make a collection of cats from the teeth!!
NOO the potato was so cute without the feet
The alien is cute but it has a random color scheme but i still love it
I tried making a squishy just like she did but... It ended out in the.. trash🗑️
The number one feat model. 4:48
Do another squishes I’ve been avoiding video there so much fun
The tooth upside down can be some rabbits!
Do more squishies that you dont want to
Make a Georgie family
Put all of your peach squishy to make a snowman ⛄ 🍑
I actually wanted you to Do the unicorn cat Who's Tale  You took 🥺
Doctor my head hurts (my head gone)
She is pregnant 🤰 🎉
I think you could probably (maybe idk) turn the giant peach into a planet squishy if you made it round like a planet and base it off one of your characters so they could have their own planet since I don’t think you’ve done something like that before
My 3 year old cousin was watching this video and he shows me the rainbow teeth u did and says “it’s ugly” “that’s ugly”😂😂
Kkkkkkkkkkill
Yo hablo español
Is she pregnant 🤰 or is it just me
Paint thoose teeth Moriah
Should have made the teeth a cream puff
You should paint a tooth squishy and make it like it has a  rainbow cavity 🌈🌈🌈
I just thought of an idea, you could take a donut squishy or any dessert and cut it in half to put between the set of teeth to make it like it’s eating a dessert❤.
the tooth squishy could be apples! and you could make the mouth into a cake
✨Pata ta man✨  ✨ alien bean  guy✨
1:44  SHOULD BE CAINE
I HAVE A CALICO CAT!!!
You could’ve turned in to a cat house and put a little little cat inside of that inside of the mouth fill it with black and then add the cat you dummy
You're evil why ripped a cute unicorn cat tail off you're evil how dare you w****f***you f*** you motherfuker you're a b****
I wish this came out when the amazing digital circus came out so she could do Caine
NAKED Christopher FACE TEAM!  👇😏🫣
They are so cute. They’re so cute. Adorable they’re so adorable.
Just do what you wanna do girlie you got this
Do you still accept used squishies? If so, how do I get one to you?
You should paint one of your teeth squishes white with frosting dripping down it, and sprinkles. It would be a sweet tooth 🦷🧁
hi I love this video    💜💗💓
As of now you could've totally done Caine from TADC!
Do feet 👣👣🧦🧦👟👞👠👡👢👟👞👠👡👢
Do teeth
it would actually be kinda cute if u glued the teeth together and made braces
mouth... all i can see it as is Caine (tadc)
Ppl that agree she should put the sprinkle song in every video 😂😂❤ 👇🏽
I was watching this in may of 2024, and when i saw this denture squishy i thought of Caine from TADC 😂😂
What did you do to him !!!😣
The mouth with the teeth could be made into sharp vampire fangs and pastel rainbow blood on the fangs!! Just an idea

You forgot the tail on the tooth cat
Heyy I’m re watching your old videos whilst I do my school project, love you moriah !!! You motivate me !! Xxx 😊😊
the set of teeth should have been chosen😢 I feel so bad for it
For the dentures, you could make them look like they bit into gum or something and the gum was stuck. Like in cartoons and stuff
little big feets is everything i need in life, he is perfection, and not to be dramatic, but i would die for him
"Make a real rainbow cake with toothpaste! Please please please please please please please please please?!"
For the last one she could have cut the thing in the middle and put a little squishy in side
Could have done a clam shell with a pearl for the teeth
I feel like if the rainbow stuff in the teeth was bubblegum and you added the face to the bubblegum it would be adorable
I Could watch your intro for hours. It’s so great and there are no caps because I don’t bother you because I’m so shook about how amazing it is.
They were so ugly, I LOVE THEM!💗💗💗💗💗😍
The first one kind of reminds me of a furby
Well, turn the teeth upside down it is a cat
0:22
The teeth/mouth could have been a clam!!
when you turned the tooth upside down And made it a cat I was like you could of made a PUSHEEN
8:35 white totoro that u?
Imagine the feet on the chicken with tiny feet 😭
You did not just just hot glue missy 5:07
You could turn the dentures into two separate skirts/dresses for another character, and make some of the random feet into mermaid tails/fins or wings
YOU SHOUDLVE MADE THE TEETH A TACO
You should of turned the mouth not the 100000000000000000000 teeth but the mouth should be Cain from the amazing digital circus
5:07 HOW DID SHE KNOW MY HAND WAS UP
THE POSSIBILITIES the teeth model squishy could've been Caïn from the Digital circus but it WASN'T OUT YET.  I'm crying
10:52  wAt dA hEcK iS ShE TaLkiNg aBoUt
Your b beautiful and if i had to pick i would pick you
Do them pls🥺🥺🥺🥺
If you don't want tooth squishies then just tell everyone to stop sending them! 😅
I’m so sad I wasn’t able to telepathically suggest making the jaw squishy into a dessert! Like those puff pastry things with like apple pie filling and whipped cream! Would have been perfect! Or even like a Japanese Sando/Katsu vibe… so many options!
who wants a part 2  👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻
I’m 16 and still enjoy these videos
Wait am I the only one who loves little big feet's so much he's my new best friend
hey can you pls do a desining a crib pls

🍬🐰🍩🐯🌈🌟🎨🐶🙂😁😮😆😜😛😣

Should have put feet on the mouth to make it one of those old toys
PEEP MENTION!!!!
123 this is so old  456 grow a pair of balls 789 are you ten 10 shut up
❗❕🎉😂
You should have one of your kids make a little footprint on one of the feet as a little keepsake
I have been watching you for 5 years❤️❤️
7:04 GRIPPERS 💀💀
U should paint a piano/keyboard and every key is a new character! If not, u should get a baby toy and paint it to be ur own, then ✨display✨ it in ur ✨cHiLdS✨ room!
For the mouth you could make galactic cat floating around in there
coming to watch for comfort cuz this was literally my childhood lol
Feet is already a plural and so no need to say feets😂
The tooth squishy upside-down looks like Totaro !
you should make BiGfEEtS a plushie/plush

I love these videos but the editing is jarring
Pls turn the teeth into a among us plssssssss
My dad’s mom’s ring bell you used in your squishy’s avoiding video
You should definitely make each of your characters have a tooth😭
You could make the tooth with sunglasses a among us character or something. (I saw this comment before but wanted to say my idea) you could make it rainbow.
I love your  videos but  can yuo make  one  squishy  that  have  God  please 😊❤
I"m Begging you to turn the mouth into Caine from the amazing Digital circus🙏🏼
The Teeth Squishies could be at the Dentist for kids when they're done getting everything done As a Prize :D
I love lil big feets 😂
The teeth can maybe be a hamburger thing?
With the denture thing, i would’ve done like a shark mouth maybe.. idk i just had that idea lol 😂
Hi I love your vids!!!
Lil big feets is amazing
Maria please consider you doing another create this book series for this year we've had not had 1 for about a couple of months please maria
You NEED to make dragon puppets!!!!!
Make a squishy of U🫵🫵🫵
I think penguin-cheeseburger should be named melisa
You could have been more creative with the teeth
Moriah you totally missed the opportunity to make a “tooth” fairy with the tooth squishy!! Add some wings and a crown(maybe a wand) that would a been so cute💗
honestly the mouth one was my favorite. it was simple but complex and pastel. I like more squishys like that☺️
Maria, could you make a video where you turn a lot of your characters into Disney characters like in Disney character costumes that’ll be so cool
Maybe we should name her penchee ❤
For the mouth you should do a cake
Another bean body to the family  Love your videos Moriah ❤️❤️❤️
I love ur vids!!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
For teeth: the sharp ones can become claws like a crab.  Also maybe a TOOTH-FAIRY 🤪
Do bad things
The tooth upside down looks like that creature from my neighbour Totoro the little white one
For the mouth add a good squishy it will look like it’s eating something
BIG FEETS  9:02
r p a n T e.😂. 😄😝😜🩷.
you should have made the full set of teeth a clam or like seashells it would probably be cute
If you could have one of Moriah's squishys what one would it be?
Hey u should turn the teeth  upside down  and make like a candy family 😊
I AM OBSESSED WITH LITTLE BIG FEETS AJAJAHFDHWNAJA
Flip the teeth squishy over and it might end up in the shape of a cat
No the goodatamma was cute
Hey Moriah for the mouth may be you should add brases with candy stuck in them! This is just my idea if you want to do it it's fine if not it's fine too!  But I like the cat tooth a lot!
How is mini me
Amazing video!! Those are very larg feet!!❤
You forgot the sprinkle song
Are you the tooth feiry
Idk if you still have the undone baby bottles but you could make a Melanie martinez crybaby bottle !
For the mouth u could’ve made a taco
Moriah’s the best☺
Hi Moriah I have a theme for you: You can show all your favorite squishy(s).
PAINT THE VELVET SQUSHISYS IN ONE VIDEO HEHEHEHEHEH😂😈😈😈😈
I'm not trying to be rude or anything but the alien 👽 looked weird
You should have done that one sean from hotel Transylvania 2 where Magnis teeth were all rainbow 🌈
YOU FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG!!!!!!😡😡😡😡
I love❤ the alien bean bodies!!!!!❤❤❤
✋👆
Do the unicorn
11:15 I love all of them, including the teeth lol

My song    Papa pig tripped on a wier fell Ina fryer bacon stripes   Triple on a tier fell Ina fire  Brent to bites   Lalalalalalalalalala
I avoided stuff like practicing my home work    Most people can relate
Her first vid seems sm longer ago then 4 years ago
stop it with the alien bean bodies! JK 🤣
The lack of sprinkle song makes me very sad
Mariah I love your videos you're awesome
I could see the mouth being cut open and a food squishy being partially placed in there.
✨video idea✨ turn yourself into Georgie  Turn into pb&j bears  Turn into pickle Turn into any bird squishy you have
Can I please do the Double laier cake squishy
Can we Do the Cake please
i really wanna see the bottle also congratulations on your sweet cute kids❤❤
The full set of teeth one could be super cute cut into one of your oversized squishies!!! Give one an awesome set of choppers pleeeeease!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
At the front angle, the dentures look like a macroroon
Can you squish them when they're painted
I THINK YOU Should a make more DOMON ese
WAIT FOR THE TOOTH  A TOOTH FAIRY
you should paint a keyboard and all the keys should have a character that’s name starts with the letter on the key and every other key should be rainbow gradient
Moriah I love you videos and I think you should make a army of cats made from teeth and you could call them teeth kitten army
Where’s th tail on it 9:26
meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! oh ok:(
hate is a very strong word🤣
You should have made a whole human face with the teeth
I love the tooth squishy, “dessert calico”! It’s so cute 🥰
If I ever need a foot, I want Moriah to preform the surgery
I love big feet’s so much
She should make another video like this one !
The way you said gudetama scratched my brain good
I think you should take a tooth and make it into a blue tooth like a connection and then make a electronic and they have a connection and are a family.
Me when I saw the jaw “canie are we having an adventure for the new sucker or what “
Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Can I have a feet squishy
Pls do a paper dragon
I'm a really good  fan 😂😂❤
THOSE FEET AT THE START WERE SOOOOOOO UGILY.AND JUST THE TEETH…TURNED SO ADORABLE
she did not  do the sprinckley sonng
Where's the sprinkle song!! 😭
Wade
For the full mouth you could of made Cain
Teeth = upside down cats and the bottom of the teeth (the legs) can be cut off and switch with bear or bunny ears😅
I love gudetama you should make gudetama sometime
when you were on the set of teeth I was like buy another on glue them together an make some sort of cookie sandwich
I kinda like the first squishy, his special
In the next vid can you change the teeth and put braces on them😊
How about, Nuffle Foot?
I love real big foots
You could have done the guy from The amazing digital circus
Moriah you should have been on sqishy
This video was so funny 😂
I love the edition ❤
Hi Moriah your my favourite youtuber and I just bought your create this book 1 !
Hey.i.used to.love your vids i just started loveing them again ❤❤❤❤❤
The teeth thing could be a beak for the peach
I immediately thought of Patty when she was trying to name Cheryl 😂

For the mouth/teeth... ever heard of Digital Circus?

This has been sitting in my watch later playlist for so long. Now I meant to watch it like the day after she posted because I was busy the day it posted but here we are now.😅
The dentures couldve been a cute clam or smt❤
Msybe add a wind up thing to it and maybe feet and eyes lol google wind up teeth ❤
2:42 of course the feet are ugly THEIR FEET
Why is the first squishy giving Mr potato from toy story 😂
You should’ve 10:04  took the mouth and turned it into. Caine from Digital circus 😊 if you have more you can and I do suggest for you to watch digital circus  so you understand better
why not turn one of the tooth squishies that has the roots and add arms?
Caine from the amazing digital circus
Omg the way she said, ready for ur last day on earth.... it made me fall put of my chair
Yes so good
Make a cupcake Qeen squishy for me please
For years, the tooth squishy has never left my mind. I actually thought Maria had made it over at a point, but then I could never find the video. Finally, the tooth squishy has made its return.
Hi! You should make a dollhouse and every room could be made for a a character and your kids could play with it
The feet 🤣🤣🤣
How do you look at a tooth an see a cat….?
Can you please do a video on making a squishie using only inverted colors? Or maybe rating all of your squishiest in inverted colors?
I love you
I thought she would make the tooth a tooth fairy
No I don't like the way you make the potato 😢
I love guita
watching this 5  months after its posted the set of teeth would be good for caine for digital circus!
SHE FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG 😭
when you used the feet for the bean body it reminded me of these 3D stickers my mom’s job used to use for employees’ kudos cards. My mom’s monitor and cubicle were dotted with these little stickers that were basically craft pom poms with little antennae and googly eyes and the sticky part was cut in the shape of a pair of big feet.   I loved them.
What about the sprinkle song?
Question why would I want to do this🎉
I love little big feets ♥︎
OMG how dare you 😩 you dint do the SPRINKLER SONG I'm un subscribing ❤️🧡💛💚🩵💙💜
Ho I'm Soo tired of her making stupid alien creatures muah haha 💅💅💅💅💅❤️🧡💛💚🩵💙💜

I love this video so much ❤❤❤❤!!!!!!!!!!! I  loved that her pants drifted  squishing in to a amazing thing's
wait the dentures squishy would be such a cool caine squishy
anybody see with set of teeth as a clam
I love your videos, I'm Piko, I'm using my mum's account!
Welcome to our very good donors! Here’s the part she’s giving the blob body parts 4:59
Despise is a stronger word for hate btw
NOOOO TAKE THE SEAMS OFFFFFF
YOU COULD OF MADE CAINE!!!
You   da  best   Miria  and can fixe   a   homan   scishy   and    turn   it    into   you ❤❤😆
No, that's definitely a bunny. No clue where you got cat from, should've stuck with the correct answer. Looks like a calico bunny
Are you pregnant.  😮😮😮
I feel like you could turn the teeth into a clam with a character face in there
The upside down tooth looks like the little Totoro’s from my neighbor Totoro
Very creative
For the tooth squishy, I was thinking you would make Totoro.
CHEEKY CHOCOLATE OMG SHOPKINSSS
Turn a tooth upside down and make it a cat ^ ^ (•_•)
if u don’t call it twinkle toes.
Can you make paper squishies please
not me watching this as a teenager while doing work
Nonononononononoooooooo call him lol feet’s 😊
PANT WHAT YOU THINK YOUR SUBSCRIBER SHOULD LOOK LIKE BUT ON A SQUISHY PLEASE
How do you think that tooth looked like a cat!? That’s a TOTORO!!!!
Suggestion.... make the "dentures" into a dessert. Cut pieces from others so you have frosting inside the mouth then try to make the top and bottom cookies so it's either an cookie ice cream sandwich or a woopie pie
Where can I find good slow rise Squishies like some of the originals
Idea: for the chocolate ones you could make a chocolate brand and put SPRINKLES in the actual chocolate
Teeth
Next time you should make Angry, lemons, Family ❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
you can also try to make the teeth squishes into something with legs because if you look at it right side up it kind of looks like an armless creature
U SHOULD TOTALLY DO THE BIG FAT SQUISHIESSSSSSSSSSS u would make an incredible thing with those!!!!
I absualtally love moriah Elizabeth's channel it's so funny shes so good at squishy makeovers shes just the best😊
I need the dentures for my mom, she just got her teeth pulled🤣🤣
Who loves her videos ❤👇
The teeth could be candy corn frrr😂
Hi
youre yooshaly meen sayinge you do not like the skwooshes that peepl giv you.
I would have turned the dentures into a sandwich 🥪 ❤️❤️
There was no sprinkle song 😢😢😢😢😢😢
I think it's kind of cool that you say puppy paint instead of puffy paint❤
I think making your own Bean body would be good Spark Idea
The last one you could have made some sort of taco
9:42 who agrees she should make them among us like
Hi Moriah , l'm a big fan ,I have I have a name for your character how about big foot junior I think it's a good name love your videos
if you ever get another pair if teeth you should make a taco
Lllllooookkkss llliiiike mmmmyyy eeeexxx
Can you make a duck squishy
You could make a tooth family and Yk how everyone has like a dirty unlce? 🤣. You could make one of the teeth dirty and make it have cavities!!
I love how she uses herself as meems it's helerious 😂I love it
How about a tooth turned into a candy corn for Halloween?
Next time you make the feet you should paint the nails and make the squishy a girl 😂
For the set of teeth mouth thing do cain from the amazing digital circus
i hate you and your dum squishy
Those feet don,t belong on this alyen been body
Her name shaud be Bergqin
I love the rainbow teeth, I actually collect teeth irl and I love rainbows! If that was in a store I’d buy it in a heartbeat!!!   Edit:Would love to see it a bit more detailed teeth wise tho, all the teeth kinda blended it and were only pure white. No shading at all. It’s totally valid but personally I just would’ve loved it a bit more of it had such things.
Can you make a 🎀 🎀  out of the teeth
she did not PLAY THE SPRINCL SONG REEEEEE😖😖😖
Stop I literally had both of those velvet squishies 😭
You should do a squishy fuggler.
Sweet tooth!!!!
chubby...potato...guy
Lil big feets aka moria rapper name ❤
8:36 it's a cunny
U should've put the feet on muscle chicken 😂😂😂😂
I love your videos
This vid was sooooooo funny…….😂🤣😂🤣
I mean I love your idea with the jaw squishy, tbh I would make it a clam with a cute pearl inside but yours is cute too! Keep up the good work <3
Can you make a drawing of Little Big Feets??
Should of made the mouth with teeth a set of golds with Dimonds then a lil black on the inside with a redish pink toung with rainbow lips and on the top and  bottom of the rest of it black. it would look super cute but like funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 plus im 15 and birthday is the thing I do I don't have alot of friends around here they all bad😂
9:48 idk about the teeth but i feel like she could’ve turned the teeth and the gums to like one of those seashells and the inside part coudlve been a pearl with a cute little face on it
Do a digital circus video and Dre's up as jax
She should put rainbow braces on the teeth!
U could have made Mr. Potato 🥔🥔
He looks like something from nopholophagus forgot how it was spelled
Just thinking that the milk carton squishies would make adorable houses based off your characters. It could be a whole village 🥹
I love the squishy
I just got an idea so hear me out:  MAKE THE PEACH INTO A GAINT JERRY THE CHERRY SQUISHY
I thought you would had changed the last denture squishy into a taco or something
Petition for i ❤ big feets
I cannot believe she put feet onto the potato #supasadandanoyed
hey I think I have an idea with set of rainbow teeth you should turn it into Caine from tadc
You could’ve made the mouse, the guy from digital circus
Cat should of been a bunny
When I look at the teeth it reminds me of the among us avatars in a way
Me:clicks on this vid. Also me:sees another vid where the thumbnail has one of the giant unicorns Moriah showed in the beginning
Have you ever seen the amazing digital circus the teeth could be useful with Caine😮
https://youtube.com/shorts/w9nGzQPbMDo?si=SzbQHVj5zjd-esKO
You should have make the bean body a Mr. Potato head😭😭😭
You should DEFINITELY do a tooth fairy with one of the teeth squishies❤🧚‍♀️
That was definitely a bunny Moriah but love your vids lol
the set of teeth would've been perfect for a squishy of Caine from The Amazing Digital Circus!!! I mean most of the work is already done, just as some eyes and there you go! but I also assume you don't know/care about that little animation as much as I do lol
Iwatoseeyorbrathrsam
I feel like for the mouth, it would be so cute if she gave it rainbow braces
You can make another monster feet, just use tooth squishy and foot squishy. Make the body fazzy  pink and purple, with horns striped in  a little darker  pink and purple. and this face D:  With a huge fang drawn on the lower jaw , I think that will be cute. You may not see my comment, but I still imagined it (,:  And of course some of your special touches
I really want one of you’re squishy’s
WHERE IS THE SPRINKLE SOOONG!
“Little big feetSSSSS”- Moriah 😂
One of the teeth look like you can turn it upside down and then turn it into a bunny       Edit i did not know y9u already did itmlol
Mack a book  for your child
Make a big cat out of the peach plss
GIVE ME THE TOOTH  CAT NOW
1. Tooth   2. Mouth.   3. Pink chocolate
i would've made the mouth a dessert taco!!
Me thinking you could make a Mr. Potato Head lol
PLEASE MAKE LIL BIG FEETS INTO A PLUSHIE!
I love toes and farts ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Stop being dramatic velvet it’s actually soft it doesn’t have the most expensive fabrics
Mariah, I do not want to see you suffer stop saying that we do not want to see you suffer got it.
She could use the teeth to make idk 50 states squishy she an amazing artist and it might be a good challenge for her
F*CK
As soon as she turned the tooth around i screamed: chibi Totoro! It looked like Totoro in shmol!
Love 💘💘💘💘💘💘😘💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜🐎🐎🐎🐎
Is Noone gonna Adress the fact that she used a Pic of the Lil peep bunny plush as a Pic for a cat plush idk I found that funny xd
I LOVE THE FIRST SQUISHY THO 💙💙
She should have painted the toenails of the little big feets😂
M-Moiah? W-Where's the sprinkle song?
PLZ🙏make a part 2
BROOO The upside-down teeth looks like one if the little guys from My Neighbor Totoro!!!🌿🌳
I used to watch these ALL THE TIME when I was a kid and I got unreasonably excited when I saw this cause I forgot about the pure joy these gave me
WHY DO I LOVE THE TEETH SO MUCH
I am in love with little big feetss
You should've used the big set of teeth and the feet to make one of those wind-up chattering teeth toys!
All the tooth squishies could be made into the lil' rabbit lookin' guys from "My Neighbor Totoro"
I LOVE 🥰 THE CATOOTH😂😂😍😍😍😘😘😆
Could always make on of the teeth into a “tooth” fairy
I think the big peach could be the angry lemon  🍋
Oh my god! Caine!
You could cut of other roots of the teeth and make them into horns ! Make them into donors
You should use one of the other teeth to make a Beanbody. The roots could be it’s little feet, and you could add something to the flat head.
You could have put those big feet on the teeth squishies and made even more of an abomination.
If only she liked the digital circus 😔
With the teeth you can make caine
I actually am tired of the alien bean bodies, I never liked them they look at me weirdly 😭😭😭
I ❤️ the tooth cat
Squishy that she made is Tayto
Should’ve made Caine from Amaing digital circuus
Next can you do the chocolate one but take the arms and feet off
You shouldve make one foot for each of your daughters in the style theme that goes with their room like with their name and bday on thr back (hidden from public view ofc) just a thought lol
I was so excited for the teeh
the chocolate squishies remind me of the alphablocks
i would of turned the teeth squishie into a taco
Skittles taste the rainbow!
I’ve been sent so many feet 🦶 😂😂😂😂
You could use the teeth for a demon
Homestuck
Make a creepy cat
You should name the l Penguin penburger
MAKE CAINE WITH THE DENTURES!!!!!!
The teeth reminded me of tadc
Tooth fairy teeth squishy!!!!!!!!!!
I love little big feets
I saw the teeth on the thumbnail and my mind immediately went to Caine
the mouth looks like a ski helmet
I'm going to give it to you straight, lady. You are obsessed with these gosh damn ice cream designs. One video its a vanilla ice cream cat with sprinkles. The next a chocolate bunny ice cream with a cherry on top. I mean can a guy get some sick and twisted devils and skeletons or something? Getting a bit old...
For the full teeth/dentures you could have cut a hole and have it eating one of the weird chocolate people.... Imagine the legs hanging out 😂
Tooth squishy.... Upside down with some wings woulr make a cute bat 🦇🦇🦇
wtf i grew up watching you... I turn 18 in march
Intro-2 minutes and 30 seconds
You should have turned the first squishy into a blob instead of having big feet
I love how she manages to rainbow or sprinkles in every squishy
you should have cut a big hole in the peach and stuffed the squishy denture set in it
8:42 Moore like back on the ground😂😂!   Get it because it was upside down, ha, you do not get it 😢
LITTLE BIG FEETS!!!!!! I AM YOUR BIGGEST FAN!!!!!!!
I feel like maybe you could've created a treasure chest with the pair of teeth(with the bright red gums lol)
You should put wings a tooth and make a tooth fairy
Are you doing good?
i feel like the feet could've been used for a yeti squishy
Do a James and the Giant Peach type thing with the peach…cut it in half and put the characters inside
you should make like a big human out of squishes like with the feet and the teeth
❤
“I’m disoriented, I can’t see.” had me dead 🤣🤣🤣
It would be so cute if you did the feet squishies and put mini-me and minier-me for your daughters and make them keychains
Okay but hear me out: litte big feets with a PEDICUREEE :3 eeh eeh. ily btw. have a splendid day . yes, i am commenting on your lovely 4 month old video
Wow😮😮😮😮😮😮😮...😮😮😮
Ewwwwwww😅

iloveyou😇😃
Hi Moriah can u do a blob family out of the tooth squishy ?

Make the set of teeth into Caine from the amazing digital circus 🎪 🎉❤
THE mouth could have been cane from amazing Digital circus 🎪  but this video was            made first 😅
From the teeth you can do AMONGUS and the tiny teeth BABY AMONGUS hope that helps
You should make the tooth squishies into Among Us characters
Hi i loved the dessert cat you did can you make it into a plushie
She turned a TOOTH squishy- Into a DESSERT cat- lol i can't-
You could've done caine from tadc! As the teeth thing or jaw thing
What you should do is you should get it squishy and you sould cut off a lot of parts on it and then the color of the pieces the color of the body will stay the color
i love the new squishy… but THE POTATO GUY WAS SO CUTE AHHHH :D
You should make a tooth fairy out of a tooth
HOW DARE YOU CUT THE TAIL OFF THAT CUTE LIL’ UNICORN CAT SQUISHY😭😭😭
How do I find the video from last week and this week on Friday
The dentures could’ve been caine
THERE WAS NO SPRINKLE SONG 9:26
If you want any ideas for the denture squishy. I recommend pairing it up with small food squishies and then cutting out the middle part of the denture squishy to place the food inside so it looks like the teeth are holding the food. Idk like one of those aesthetic images of someone with a lipstick color and a sucker? But it's with teeth.
Sauce
I love Little Big Feet’s!!!!😊
Can you make a video for cats only
I'm so a noted of the aliens bean bag
I saw the dencher aquishy and thought KANE!??! XD
You didn't use the sprinkle song when you did the tooth cat
You could do designs on the teeth part
I feel bad 4 u 🤢
If you turn the dentures on its side, it kind of like an dessert taco
I'd love to see the giant peach painted in a simple way similar to the little tiny mango 🥭 squish from one of her first squishy makeover videos.
I❤little big feets
When I saw the dentures, I imaged the stuff in the mouth as a river and you could sand or cut down the teeth into land. Idk, I thought it would be kinda cool.
I'm a bit late, but I can't tell you how much I love This channel. Right now I have a twisted rist, and after watching just a couple vids, I felt better right away, I don't want to make this comment really long, but main message is that this channel Is the BEST. but the rest squishies- •°•
I say I would use  the set of teeth to make Caine from tadc
u could use the feet as wings i guess
Sprinkle song?!??!
You could make the tooth squishes a tooth fairy
I WAS FIXATING SO MUCH OVER THE FIRST ONE you could've turned it into mr potato head from toy story!! I know you love making your own creations but that was the first thing i though of 😂😂
You should do your characters on teeth
james and the giant peach
i’m a huge fan I love your videos. Hope you have fun making videos  I love your series of painting, squishy things
1. CAN I SEND YOU SQUISHIES?
The first one with the weird feet reminds me like the potato toy, from toy story because of the feet 😭
i love her
When I saw the mouth squishy I immediately mediately thought of Caine from tadc
I hate the feet
U couldve done a pearl one using the teeth like a pearl inside a seashell
Happy New year to you all 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤🥳🥳🥳
IT DIDNT EXIST WHEN THIS WAS MADE BUT I WOULD TOTALLY TURN THE SET OF TEETH INTO CAINE FROM TADC (caps lock not rewriting this)
Small feets!😂😂😂
SHE SHOULD MAKE THE MOUTH ONE EATING CANDY
she hates the set of teeth one but i see caine from tadc
On the first one I thought mr potato head also u should totally do a mr potato 🥔 head squishy 😂
I subscribed because I love your views

rman his guy is not gonna be a foot model when she said that bi died of laughter
The first one looked like a potato head
I love the alien bien body ❤😂🎉

You could have made a taco of the mouth
You can make the peach into you cherry with buttcheaks character in spark!
yk what i was thinking of when the dentures....CAINE FROM THE AMAZING DIGITAL CIRCUS
Caine
Caine
[NEW COMMENT BOMB]  She should do a video painting on all the stress balls! She always says she hates the stress balls and she would never paint them, well this is the week!!!! ❤
The 1st one is so cute it should be called Brutus idk why it just should 💀😭
You should do a fairy tooth! Like a tooth fairy but the other way around:)
Daddy I love you
MAKE BIG FEETSSSSS A PLUSH!!!!!!
I just need the furry guy with big feet to have toe nails 😭
For the teeth I was thinking a clam with a pearl inside
Name suggestion for little big feet: smeet 😂
i think she should use the dentures and add cavitys, but like, rainbow i feel like my vision is hard to describe but like rainbows coming out of the molars as if they ate a bunch of rainbow candy (feel free to comment bomb this)
Bro as soon I gave you this idea (⬇️) you took it from my mind.😅
I have an idea for the squishes. You should turn one of the teeth around and then make it into a cat!😮 you get me?😅
i am on someones phone and i love your ideas

Can I have the big blue tooth and I can trade you for a 😊love bunny
You are awsome

Moriah I have a video idea for u, u should make animal squishies into something they are not supposed to be
It was an among us character the tooth
i have a question does moriah want another child if so boy or girl?? 👧👦
u should do a number two of this vid moriah whos w\ me
☹️
OK I MAY BE LIKE 3MO LATE BUT i just gotta say…the moment I first saw that set of teeth squishy I instantly thought of Cane from “The Amazing Digital Circus” …😗   just cut some of the inside of the mouth out add some eyeballs, put a top hat on it, give it a body with a red suit and black pants and a cane..🤩😊
I wonder how much squishes she can make out of the useless lifeless body parts.
You should add a mini  face to I side of the dencers
You should have made the mouth biting the giant peach
Why don't you take that teeth squishy, turn it on its side and make it into like a little opened purse, or even shape it a little as is and make it into a clamshell type thing?
for the feet you should of made it a tattle tale
the last squishy would’ve been perfect for caine from the amazing digital circus
U should have used the dentures to make Caine from tadc
When I saw the set of teeth I thought it could be a desert taco if on its side
Can you show me the dentures came from the amazing digital circus but a squishy
I know I'm late. This being months ago however, when I looked at the full set of teeth, I seen cake or some type of pastry or sandwich or taco or pita or clam 🎂🍰🥠🍙🌮🥙 or I'm just hungry lol😂
The tooth cat thing looks like the bunny dad off of “ The amazing world of gumball
just saying, you should’ve put dirt in the  jumper thing that would’ve looked way cuter
NOT GUTATAMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mhhh waaewaaahhh
You should name the dessert calico cat, Pixie!!!! It would be so cute!!!! Luv ur vids btw ❤❤
Aww I saw rainbow😊
Ngl i thought you would make the guy from toy story from the first one
She is the best artist that is an adult that I have seen 👁️ and can you do a video of you reacting to your old weird videos?????
NOO NO SPRINKLE SONG
3:58
You can make a blob out Of the peach squishy
whats that one like movie slash book thats like smth and the giant peach? you could do that
i think i had that exact narwhal  velvet squishie
YKW, the big tooth one would be PERFECT for like studio ghibli characters
tbh i wouldve done mr potato head but im kinda rlly excited to see alien blob
You maybe could of turned the mouth at the end into a burger maybe
This is bob 🦆  One like = 1 year. How old is bob when u see him?
Why no sprinkle song :( there was sprinkles
1035 10:35 the best part
You could make Caine from the amazing Digital circus with the mouth squishy
I was thinking a sweet tooth idea for the tooth
like if you love Moriah's art or you hit the like button
You are soooooo cool
This is what I would do with the massive peach and the massive blue and green and purple with stars alicorn and make it look like it's eating the massive peach and make the alicorn peach theme and name her peaches then fix the massive unicorn that's laying and make it bed time theme with pajamas and with a teddy bear and name her Sleepy and for the happy massive unicorn and make it pearlescent rainbow theme and name her rainbow pearl
I feel like the teeth wouldve looked great with rainbow braces aswell. Just in my own opinion!  love it as it is but I think adding some braces would look cute!
SNJDKSKDKSSJX YOU COULD MAKE CAINE FROM TADC
hi Moriah you are really cool and funny i love watching your videos
My nephew got a squishy for Christmas put up her and looks like he’s on the right track
with the mouth squishy, you could make a chattering teeth toy squishy with it
The tooth upside down also reminds me of the little creatures from My Neighbor Totoro, it would be cute to make the set of them from the movie out of the different sized teeth
9:51 CAINE!!!!!!!! from the amazing digital circus
She the definition of slay queen 👸
I thought you were going to make a tooth fairy holding a tooth
I think for the tooth squishy it wouldve been rlly good if you did like a tooth fairy or like a 'sweet tooth squishy' and theres like candy/sweets around the tooth, those are probably what i wouldve done and i would love to see u try it!
Have anyone got mini mystery plush from moniah Elizabeth I have got pickle cuteeee
1:44 MAKE IT INTO CAINEE FROM TADC
With that pair of teeth you can make cain
I love all of them but the denchers I swear I thought you were going to make the teeth like how you made the inside of the mouth
Marshmallow clold be the tooth 🦷, teeth can be a Shell 🐚, feel can be a big 🌼,
it could be cute to make Totoro's {from my neighbour Totoro} out of the teeth
you could put like 6 feet together and make a cloud and or flower
You should make a Family with the  cats🐈🐈‍⬛
She should have made cane from the amazing digital circus
On the mouth  you should’ve put braces on the teeth
You could've made a different version of the rock monster from My Singing Monsters! Like a distant cousin type thing
you can make one of the teeth an among us player
I thought to make the mouth squishy into a little guy coming out of a cave that has moss and grass/flowers on the bottom
7:09 lol
Omg you could have used all 4 of those matching teeth and made braces or smth, or made them a 90’s work out group
I think the chocolate people are shopkins lol
Big squishy
what about a princess tooth fairy, with a little crown (cause you know teeth sometimes need crowns)
Can you please make a Nafologion whale

Can you turn a tooth into a Totoro?
u coulda have  made the teeth a taco maybe \_'o'_/

0:08 Hola, ¡soy el primer comentario importante!
TADC fans: CAINE?!?   Edit: if yk yk.
I don't have spark on my app store does it not work on android
The cat is adorable!🐱
The intro is a banger in 1.5x speed
Not me watching this at 1:39 AM
Honestly i'd call big feets "feefee" (feet 2 times without the T)
Moriah should paint a globe as nafalafagus. Like this so she can see.
Maybe you can decorate the teeth to foods you eat?
Who made topics?
You should have made the teeth into Caine from the amazing digital circus!
It looks like big foot as a fat potato
i have an idea for one of the denture squishies: CAINE FROM THE AMAZING DIGITAL CIRCUS!!! i think itd be an easy makeover and its really really recognizable to a hundred million people
Moriah is amazing
I. LOVE. THE. BEAN. BODIES!!! Please don’t listen to any potential haters. Keep the nafalophoghs lore and bean bodies as long as you have ideas and passion please!!!
YOU FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG
Eeeesdescgwsdcqwdedfvippjghrc🎉xllxlxlxls.eeoep I think 🤔 will  wec the ❤of kids 😢🎉for a few years and outdoorsy them 😱 😱 a good
I used to watch you in the 3rd grade. I'm a high schooler now lol
You should make the teeth into a dessert waffle taco or just a regular taco
That uni kitty one on the first one for squishy donating was so sad because it's one of my favourite animals😭😭😭
Bruh loll
You should take the teeth and turn them upside down and make them into peeps. Or bunny rabbits
If you cut the weird center chunk out of the teeth and prop it open with a large round thing it could be a clam and pearl, you know, if you hate it enough and want to do something about it. ^~^
Yes I am
Yes I
idea : Tooth fairy.
You could use the teeth as part of a face. Like if you made a large animal or bean body squishy, you could add the teeth to go with it.
I feel like the tooth upside down looks like Totoro from My Neighbor Totoro
the dentures remind me of Caine from tadc
Alien bean bodys are out of space blobs
Not gonna lie, now that the digital circus is out, the set of teeth could have been cane, I'm not a fan of that video but that just made me though of the amazing digital circus
Idea for the teeth squishies: nofelofagous fruit. Idea for the dentures: combine into huge squishy and replace the mouth with three dentures. And make into giant monster. :) just trying to be helpful
Cool 😂😂is look like a monster 👻 👽
What abt caine
You should make actual squishies with your designs for us to buy!
the mouth reminds me of caine from TADC
I have create this book by MORIAH ELIZABETH
You should do big sushi
Hey new follower can you try something new please do a video painting or decorating a Stanly cup or water bottle or tumbler cup please try I would love to see you do one PLEASE
The only thing I’m kinda mad about is that Moriah didn’t paint the set of dentures as a bunch of blobs hanging on
Anyone else think of lil peep whe she said peep cat or do i just have issues
I have an idea tomake a jaw squishy. First. Remove the grild rainbow cheese. Paint 2 white circle on the mouth. Paint blue small circle on left white circle and paint green small circle on right white circle. But find a top hat squishy. If you don't have one. Make a new top hat squishy and put to the upper jaw and there you go. You got caine squishy from the amazing digital circus :D
when she asked what the tooth squishy looked like my mind went to 'Totoro!".....
I'd take the set of teeth and just turn it into Caine 🤣
I think maybe putting a cupcake or another sweet treat between the teeth would’ve been cool
Mum:why do u hate the boys in ur grade so much? Me: 0:37
I feel so sad for big foot dude because his feet are so ugly
What if she turned the teeth into caine
I just wanna say. Make a dragon puppet for a video. Please.
You could turn the set of teeth into Caine from tadc
YOU COULD HAVE TURNED THE TOOTH.. INTO THE TOOTH FAIRY. A FAIRY, THATS A TOOTH!
When I saw the feet I immediately thought turning them into cute ghost squishies, with the toes being the bottom 💀😭
squishy idea: make a big tooth fairy with the random teeth squishes it could be VERY hard to make but may look so adorable
The last one could've been Caine from TADC (also i think it was supposed to be a chattering teeth toy, that's why it's so bright red)
I would have turned the mouth squishy into a purse with stuff poking out of the opening
You would do a part 2!!!!☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
😂
… I love your bush baby beanbody
Could have turned the mouth in a cake
i was kinda hoping that she was gonna turn the teeth into caine from TADC
Try doing a challenge where you can only use rainbow colors for a squishy makeover
You should have made the tooth a pair with your rainbow toothpaste little boring but you still could’ve
Moriah, u could make the mouth of teeth the character from shark boy and lava girl!! But Moriah style (like make it eating candy) Guys make her see this idea cause what else would she do with it😭😭

You could have turned the teeth set into an oyster
the teeth gave me tadc vibes
In the teeth why couldn’t the teeth be like fur and a little person inside the mouth. Or put ears on it and make it into an alien? I love what you do. My granddaughter has Asperger’s and she loves watching you. She is the one that showed me your videos. Good job keep up the good stuff!!!!

I don’t like velvet because it makes my nose tingle❤
I love your video's they are so fun to watch🤩😄!!
you can make the teeth sitting cats, just turn them upside down!
Reading this is pointless, you’ve been warned…        Once upon a time there was a girl who was just as bad and as ugly as a toad. She spent her life trying to find her one true love. The girl grew up and became a woman only to find out she was even more ugly than before. She tried desperately to find a man to marry, but she was unable to find love with her looks. The woman had a brilliant plan. She faked her death to see who would care. Whoever cared was to marry her. But why would they marry someone who faked their own death? She thought of this for thirty-two and a half years before realizing she was asleep. She worked up a storm of anger at the time she thought had gone by, that was really seconds. She woke up to a happy family. A husband two kids, a dog, and a beautiful body. She killed her self the next day after she woke up again.       The end.
11:08 u could have done caine
You could have made Cain from the amazing digital circus!!
Please bring spark to android/samsung!!!!! I need it but i only have a samsung😭😭😭
Should you realise you heard people people feelings by doing that because some people send them to you for nicely but what did you do for me
I know she likes to stick with making her squishy’s as original characters but the set of teeth at the last part just needs eye balls to become Caine- from the amazing digital circus-
Could you make a cat family with all your teeth squishies?
MORIAH YOU FORGOT TO PUT YOUR SIGNATURE ON Little big feetSS
First one definitely could’ve been mr potato head instead
Hii  you could have done the teeth squish like a taco but sand down the teeth ad letteuce and then make it your style
To the teeth you should have put feet at the bottom of it I think it would've been funny
Why did you not just put the spot on the iey!
Dear Moriah Elizabeth,               I don't need feet... plez get dem crusty, musty, dusty, rusty, funky smellin doggies away from me.                                                                                                                                                                                              from, Potato P.S. This was for a bit of humor and I just tried to make your day or someone else's.
Cut tools off the feet!
The teeth into little animals!
You should have made the tooth that one character Totoro❤ but I love the cat
there's this new series called the amazing digital circus and it's one of my hyperfixations and there's a character that's made out of a set of teeth so my mind ofc named the squishy caine-
8.29: you could totally use the other teeth upside down as a bunny head like you said! in fact if you wanted to expand on the idea just attach it to a body (or dont, if youd like a decapitated rabbit head ^^') and either trim the bottom so its a chin, or make the two smaller round bumps a little :3 type of mouth and put a nose over, it would kind of be like those bunnies with really fat cheeks but really cute tiny ears ^^
It looks like you’re making some sort of Furby rip off monstrosity.
3:36 that thing is not good Ohtama, or an alien that’s those fuzzy egg creatures that we used to watch as kids. I know I’m not the only one who knows what I’m talking about.
2:04 I have never never heard somebody call the Shopkins chocolate bars, chocolate bar people.
You can make Caine from the amazing digital circus.
I saw a giant creeper squishy at my GameStop the other day. I wonder what you would do with it…. I didn’t get it cause it was ripped though.
From the mouth with the teeth u could make Lil People inside like they are cleaning the.
You should make the dentures a macaroon!(:
Peeps are bunnies
when i seen that jaw i thought of caine (TADC)
no sprinkle song :(
if you turn the mouth of teeth sideways it kinda looks like a dessert taco
make the amazing digital circus
OMG CAINE?!
Ok but Lil big feetss is so cute 😂 If you dont want him I can take him :p
What didn't you make the tooth fairy
She could make the set of teeth into Caine from digital circus
For the denchers, I thought of cane from the amazing digital circus.
i think you should make your squishies from scratch instead of using other squishy parts
Smart view and a
Do you more of the unfixable pussies
How dare she do that to gooda tama
u couldve made the teeth bite into a cake or something ;-;
teeth one could be like a cave and something/ someone could be peeking through it
coulda made the teeth into caine from tadc💔
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Cataform
The foot alien literally reminds me of the jubjub neopets 😂
When I saw the feet squishies, I immediately thought ‘Mr. Feets!!’ 😂
I never had a squishy and I want 1 now
DO YOUR BIGGEST SQUISHES
why not turn the teeth around and make it a taco bunny that had the fillings in the between of its ears aka the teeth??
YOU FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG
Get a tooth squishy, add wings and make a tooth fairy 🤞
Who else thought of Claude from tadc when the set of teeth appeared
Turn the teeth into among us characters
I love your videos 😍📸📸😍
I saw in the denture squishy a big fat s’more
I wish she turned the mouth/teeth/dentures into Caine from The Amazing Digital Circus 🎪
10:50 The dentures are an abstract representation of the experience of eating Skittles. "Taste the rainbow!"
All I could think of when she started the denture squishie was "what if someone made a Cain Squishie (from the amazing digital circus)
The expression of the green foot is the same as Moriah’s 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Just sent the teeth and tooth to dentist
I wish she would have made the teeth into Caine. Who agrees
You couldn't have turn the mouse into a clam with an animal inside
Little big feets 😂 I love it
And this is why I'm subribed.  Also, I almost feel bad for Moriah 'cause of all those TEETH she was sent 😂
Do a giant unicorn 🦄
for the teeth i think she should have made a tooth fairy
Looking back at this...the teeth set one looks like Cain from TADC😂 and i cant unsee it or unhear ir
This first squishy was a missed opportunity to make Mr Potato😭
I love little big feets
I would make a donut opened
You could have made caine from tadc
I love the cat🥺 ain't gunna lie I thought that you would make the set of teeth some form of dessert taco🍭🌮 with the teeth being frosting/whip cream🧁🍦
Ok but we’re is his pedicure
I love Big Feets ans the cat-bunny !!!
Just as a idea for the teeth, you can paint it as a bunny (the spiky thingys are ears, etc) it would be adorable ❤❤❤❤❤
Did you all see the milk squishy when she showed the theeth lol she has to do them NOW💀😤
Do another one of these! It would be fun.
Consider, you could make the other teeth into little Totoro!
SHE DIDNT DO THE SPRINKLE SOMG
The first one is like a "Mr potato head" 😂😂
The dentures remind me of a macaroon
Turn a giant tooth into a among us character
I thought she was gonna make the teeth grills
You should sell them❤
I think that she should have made the mouth squishy a macron😅
If only she knew what The Amazing Digital Circus was then she would get a quick idea for the teeth💀💀
Could you do another Q&A video?❤
You should’ve turn the set of teeth squishy into Caine from Digital Circus. Only if you wanted to or you’ve watched Digital Circus yet.
I would turn the teeth around and turn I into a cat
Make a tooth fairy out of one of the teeth 🤷‍♀️
Opportunity missed with the teeth I mean I know this video is made earlier than this came out but you should’ve made it from the tadc
an icecream taco for the mouth wouldve been so fun
with the teeth mouth squishy you could have made a monster peeking out of a dark clam-shaped thing (paint the outside black or something and make the part you made rainbow into the part where it peeks out)
put all the teeth together to make a crown!
Watch the amazing digital circus
you should do a collection of animals with tooth bases
8:32  IT LOOKS LIKE THE NEW JEANS LIGHTSTICK
i think you could have made the teeth into somthing else like making the inside of the mouth rainbow instead you could have made the teeth rainbow instead
put a heart in the replies if you like moriahs content
my name is mia  and i am with my friend macelyn we are using my dad's account we love your been body aliens
I'm watching this in the future and so for the tooth squishy you could have kept it the same way not upside down or sideways you could have made a little penguin popsicle I'm not sure if you made it in the future or in the past but you made a pin of it and it's really cute so you should make it that next time paint the tooth
With the mounth squishy, I kept thinking of Caine from TADC😂😂😂
I really like the bean it’s cute in a weird way ❤
I have an idea for the teeth, paint white, turn upside down and make the little white Totoro from My Neighbor Totoro.
I saw the jaws and….           BUY ANOTHER AND MAKE IT CAINE FROM THE AMAZING DIGITAL CIRCUS
6:23 I really like the original body😢
The calico cat should have been called Cece
The tooth squishy became a cat with a sweet tooth
What nooooo don’t do it I luv the lil potato 3:26
For the mouth she could make a taco or even a cookie sandwich
I want a the little one please 😊
I think that you should make one of the teeth from the little fraction 🤭a bluetooth tooth if you get me😂😭
the only person that could see a cat in a tooth is moriha elezabeth. LOL
U should’ve made the teeth a taco 👍
Thhhe mouth should be Caine 💀😭
Moriah should paint her cars has cars for some of her characters. For example a pineapple car for Georgie or a burger car for cousin derp
You should get a copy of the set of teeth and turn it into cane from the digital circus
People who wanted her to make caine from the amazing digital circus with the gums 👇
You could add wings to the one with a crown and make her a tooth fairy
CAINE
Meanwhile,In the amazing digital circus...  *CAINE IS JOINING THE TOOTH CHAT...*
can you make the set of teeth caine from TADC?
Nah those tooth’s look so scary 😟
When u got the teeth squishy, I immediately thought of Cain from The Amazing Digital Circus lol
Pls fix big boy squishy
I love her original editing!!
Anyone else saw the jay tooth squishy and thought of Caine from Digital Circus?
You should make Caine from TADC with the teeth!
Give the teeth little pants
You could have turned the single teeth into little ghosts
Its a sweet tooth!!!😃
I love Littlebigfeetssss.
Did everyone think that she was making mr potato head at first?
If u get another mouth u should make a taco
C-can you give a makeover to my mental health???
For the tooth, you could’ve made it into a “sweet tooth”
YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE THE TEETH CAINE
☝️ I raise my hand
The teeth-set could become a taco
Moriah for an idea for the teeth ideas you should make a character with their mouth open with a lost tooth and make it holding the tooth!
TOOTH SUGGESTION::  Tooth Fairy!! Add wings and a little wand!!
Do my naber totoro🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🥺
Ello me is fan of you 😊❤🎉
You can take a bunch of mini dessert squishies and glue them to the middle part of the mouth.
I HAVE A SUGGESTION FOR THE TEETH 🦷 Following the upside down angle, how bout Totoro and his(?) little rabbit(??) fuzzy friends From my neighbor Totoro? 😗🥺
i rlly wish she could have made this after The amazing digital circus to make caine 😭
Sorry if I spelled his name wrong
Say hi to oppi for me
I love your videos so much also you have so many squshishy,s
Hi Moriah why do every time you get a strawberry squshishy it doesn't have a stem
The mouth one you could have made Caine from tadc! :) also I’ve been a really big fan for a long time
love the little big feet guy! so cute!
Me who was hoping she'd do caine from the digital circus:  Jkjk love ur content moriah ;-; ❤
Tooth with wings Tooth fairy.
I want that set of teeth squishy so i can make Cain from The Amazing Digital Circus 😅
the teeth lowkey look like a body of the things in my neighbour totoro
The teeth should have been Caine from tadc!,
I think if you really wanted to do those teeth, you could make them upside down into a cat. (no i dont rlly know iff that is going to happen because i havent finished watching the vid yet.)  HEY YEAH IT DID HAPPENNN HAHA NVM!!  (also them squishies lowkey kinda cute tbh)
Cringe
lol
That fat potato thing I think is a Tayto Potato I am pretty sure he is a Japan character
you should have made caine with the dentures-
Where can you buy squishys thre are none anywhere
hell yeah :D
For the big mouth squishy maybe add a food or dessert inside of the mouth by cutting a bit of the inside to add space to place something inside. An idea to fix it and add to fixing squishies.
The chocolate bar squishes are amazing😂 I want one. I love when features are added to inanimy objects and I like the unsettling cutesie vibe
The tooth is my favorite lol
I was hoping you would make the set of teeth and make it Caine from the amazing digital circus IT WAS PERFECT :(
I love but I would love it more if you didn’t ruin it with the blue
You should’ve made the first one mr potato head
make another dinosaur related to pickle
What if she made one of her tooth squishies a “sweet tooth”
Who else kinda wanted the tooth squishy to be turned into Caine from the amazing digital circus
Sprinkle song
Little big feet’s could be named little foot
She said it again pastel
With the teeth/ dentures you should have made a little creature inside the mouth instead of rainbow cheese sandwich, would have been so cute
If only this wasn’t a month before the amazing digital circus lol:3
What if the giant peach turned into a pretty patty?👀
I wanted her to make Caine from the amazing digital circus 😢
me sitting here hoping they will take caine from tadc for the teeth
PLEASE carve into the giant peach squishy and make it a pastel peach house for your small squishies (or an apple for small worm sqishies)
What paint do you use
I  feel bad for you but you did a good job ❤😊
I love your videos ❤❤❤
I could be Grimaci 👇

for the teeth i thought you would make a cake or dessert
I always laugh at Moriah’s videos. Her jokes are just to funny
A peep-style cat is a Meep.
I feel like you could have made the Denchures a dessert sandwich or dessert hamburger ❤
There’s a way you can turn the teeth into a cake. Just cut the rainbow part of the mouth with the top teeth attached and flip it over. The shape of the teeth kind of look like icing on a cake. You could cut or sand it to shape it and add puffy paint to even out what will become the icing. Just a thought.
Give the teeth squishy to me pls
Am I the only one who thought she was gonna make the denture looking squishy into a macaroon?
Cats tail?
For the teeth with the gums, you could’ve made it into like a macaroon because the teeth could be white like frosting and the inside could be a filling
big feetsssss must be from Nofalofagus
The teeth could have been a seashell 😂
first bro looking like a candy corn at first
You should make an eye shadow palette
I NEED A UKELELE SQUISHIE APOLOGY WITH TEARS NOW!!! HOW DARE YOU FORGET THE SPRINKLE SONG
I love this😊
You could've turned the feet into flippers maybe.
I love how u used the tooth to make a cat but it kind of looks more like a bunny!
Moriah 😢 where did the sprinkle song go? Please bring it back. It would make so many people so happy
for the final teeth or dentures one you cold have made it a creepy monster and painted eyeballs in the mouth 👄
u shouldve named him normal feet
Loved little big feets
>:o I remember watching your vids when I was smol!! Finally found your channel!
I love these videos ty o much Mariah
Nooooo bean feet call it bean feet
LIL BIG FEETS
U should have made the tooth amongus
I have never been more in love with a squishy in my life, little big feets is wonderful
A gudetama squishy would be so cute
img you can make an upside down tooth the little totoro
For the teeth ones, you can paint a mokke
MORIAH ! DO THE REST OF YOUR PANDABUN SQUISHIES 4 YEARS LATER ! 🐼
As soon as you said doner to the unicorn that was donating to the gutetama I heard sirens go off on my street 😂
I was thinking for the teeth you could add a body and a head and make a person!
I love your channel
Mighty  Optimistic  Rare Interesting  Amazing  Hardworking   Essential  Lovely Inclusive  Zesty  Awesome  Beautiful  Earthly  Terrific  Handsome 🤨   We love you  moriah

YOU SHOULDVE DONE TOTORO FOR THE TOOTH OMG
Moriah please please please make caine(the amazing digital circus)
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring back the ME NAIL POLISH! I would LOVE
anybody else thinking about Caine from tadc?
Unpopular opinion bc not many normal people (opposite of me) watch it, SHE COULD MAKE CAINE FROM THE AMAZING DIGITAL CIRCUS
You should do one of the teeth as a sweet tooth it can be dessert themed
Personally, I would of made a sweet tooth, and make the tooth have candy on it
am i the only one that saw a clam for the last one?
You forgot the tail 😭😭
OMG THE ALIEN COULD HAVE BEEN THE MONSTER WITH A SOCK FROM MONSTERS INC
The teeth looks like it could become a rainbow among us, and the whole mouth you could recreate the ugly sculpture Spencer created in Icarly
When i saw the mouth i thought -CAINE FROM THE AMAZING DIGITAL CIRCUS🤓☝️"
I was legit shouting "CAAAAIINNNEE" at the screen when you did the dentures one XD
i haven’t watched u in years and it’s so nostalgic
My uncle said he thinks your friend Jackie is annoying
how do i send stuff im a kid using my dad's acount
For the set of teeth you could have done Cain from digital circus
she should've made caine out of the teeth!!
a tooth fary
You could  have turned the gums and teeth to a cookie with rain bow icing inside 😢
potato head
3:16 gdutama
8:34 I can't be the only one that was thinking of a plastic bag
When i saw the dentures,Why did I think of kaine?
TURN THE SET OF THEETH INTO CAINE FROM TADC
Use the feet on the dentures and make it the walking teeth toy 😭😭😭
She should try to get another one of the whole set of teeth squishy so she can make it the amazing digital circus (Caine) ❤❤❤ who agrees?🩵🩵 👇
My idea for the denture squishy is that you could put one of your characters on each tooth along with the rainbow grilled cheese. Or you could give it braces it and put your characters on the braces. Or a more simple idea, which I'm not sure if you'll like is to just put random characters or symbols on the teeth. You could also cut a the space in between the teeth into a tongue shape so it's more natural. These are my ideas, I hope you like a few of them! I really hope that see my comment too!! 😃😊
Make the set of teeth squshie gains from dogmatism circus
can u make gay squishies pls there"s just ALOT of couples (omg my grammar is so bad)
You should customize a keyboard and each letter would have a different character! Like and repost so Moriah can see!!
why the potato?? :( anyway you can make the teeth not the small ones the big one and add braces and give it to a dentist, and can u make a kitty series with the teeth
The set of teeth should have been caine
The velvet squishies are adorable 💖
Can you please pant one of your teeth squishies to be cane from TADC ❤
You could have flipped over both feet so he'd have 2 left feet and called him the Potato who doesnt dance
Maria keeps on forgetting to use the sprinkle song is super annoying
Turn the teeth into tooth fairy’s
The cat is my favourite
Peeps are bunny’s lol
You should make a doll house for one of your squishy characters, with custom furniture
little foot name ideas
I literally had that same exact tooth with the pink ring as a kid from a claw machine😭
CAINE CAINE CAINEEEEEEEE (from the amazing digital circus)
Hiiiiii I love your  content!! 😊 your one of the best creators 🩷
i LOVE LIL BIG FEETS????? HES SO PRECIOUS
If the digital circus existed, when you were doing this video, you could’ve done cane the ringmaster
when she mentioned the tooth squishy looks like a cat, I was like wait it looks like it could be the small white totoro thingy... maybe make that with your next tooth
Sweet tooth! You could turn the teeth into different sweets.
I missed watching this channel
The teeth u could paint gems on them for tooth gems
Mariah is an amazing artist
YOU COULD’VE MADE CAINE FROM THAT..😫💀
How about lil’feet?
A mouth with character teeth. Now there’s an idea!
You could make Kane from the amazing digital circus
Big feets kind of looks like a panda
Again again again again again again again do it again
I love your squishy makeovers and just so you know your meams are so funny.And you know how you have that CUTE orange fuzzball that lives in your house well I have one that looks exsacedly the same.Also did anyone ever tell you your amayzing at painting?
My new fave squishy is little big feat ❤

Me dodging and finding every excuse to not fix my problems 😭
No sprinkle song for the tooth?! 👹
I love Little Big FeetsSssSs! Petition to get him his respect 👇✨
Of course that very video she finally decides to do the dentures a character with a pair of teeth as a head comes out directly after 😂
you should put braces on the teeth because my daughter has braces!!!!!
The ppl who thought of tadc after seeing the dentures
Everyone sending the weird thing is that she never wants to do why did you buy them in the first place
Girl forgot do say about the cars lol😂
Love ur vids but can u do the peach pretty please😊
The sprinkle song...... You didn't play the sprinkle song...
When i saw the dentures i instantly saw a little purse that’s unzipped or a taco
I would have used the mouth one to make a XL mouth creature. But still love the pastel you did.
Cut up the big peach squishy and make it into a mouth and use the teeth squishes
I actually kind of like the rainbow grilled cheese teeth. 100% would buy!
Is there any people who thought of cane from the amazing digital circus when they saw the set of teeth squishy
I LOVE LIL' BIG FEETS <3
My mind went to caine from tadc when I saw the dentures 😭
If you get another dentures one make it Caine from tadc
Moriah WHERE IS THE SPRINKLE SONG?!
Really a mouth
You should make a Series where are you only paint teeth cats
Where’s the giant squishies
YOU CAN MAKE CAINE FROM TADC

I know exactly what she could do w the mouth squishy but it would be very difficult
It looks so so so beautiful ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Would have looooved a little Totoro made out of the tooth!
imagine if you made a set of teeth with braces and each bracket as a character or you could make some teeth rotten with a character sticking out, you could make cavities but not normal cavities, rainbow or characters cavities
She could have turned the mouth squishy into a icecream sandwich
Love is 😊
She should have changed the dentures into a clam!!
You could make the last mouth one into a smore!
NO NO NO PUT THE GRIPPERS AWAY
Okay the like full set of teeth squishy could've probably been turned into like a clam shell or something.
The first vid I watched was “ wreck this journal 3…..
u shouldve given the alien one toe nails 😀
Since no one is saying it, the first one looks like candycorn.
You should paint velvet squishys
For the other single teeth squishies I thought you could make them look like the forest sprites from my neighbor Totoro!
I like little big feet the most lol
Can u make Pomni out of a squishy I subscribed
Only her fans can like this comment     👇
Honestly, that sun glasses tooth looked kinda like an apple. 🍎 🤷
You should have cut the inside of the mouth and put a small character inside I'm not sure if that would be possible anyway I hope you have a great day ❤️
Ifi were moriah i would make the teeth Caine from tadc
MISSED YA SHOT TO MAKE GRILLSSSSS U COULDVE DONE CUTE LITTLE CHARACTERS ON THE TEETH
The teeth look more and less natural and make me squirm less than realistic ones.
I have that teeth squishes
Make a teeth crown
You should have Mr potato head with the first one

I LOVE PANITING  PLISHIE
I LOVE THAT
People who have been around when the panda bun’s video was made  👇
You could do a bunch of different of teeth cats… 🤷‍♀️
The tail on the upside down tooth shaped cat is missing…😭
I LOVE FEETS!!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤§❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Who else thought of the dentures as a chocolate sandwich opportunity? With the teeth as marshmallows. Or is it just me?
i love you moriah
Don’t know if it’s been suggested I’m late to the party 😂 but a tooth could be turned into a tooth tooth fairy (anyone play sims4 you’ll know 😊)
The upside down tooth reminds me of the Studio Gibli, my neighbor totoro things that collect the acorns
Moriah could have mad those denchers or teeth  a rainbow mushroom just cut the bottom off and put a face on it😊😊
I think for the first one your should have stuck the feet to the front so it looked like it was sitting down! 🥹 you should make a little family unit to use up all the feet!
You should make a giant shark with the teeth and you could use the peach as the shark. I will also be a challenge for you and I love the making of new designs for example , the impossible bin challenge. I love all your results too ,good or bad.<3 :)
Why does it say only 44 likes? 😅
could’ve made a macaron out of the teeth!
Make the tooth/cat into Derek’s older sister
Hi
I would have loved a rainbow galaxy on the dentures!! Like looking into the universe
WHAT ABOUT THE SPRINKLE SONG😭😭😭
WHERE WAS THE SPRINKLE SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!
lol  🤛🏻👱🏻‍♀
he can be from naughfalaughugus (sry if i spelled it wrong) :))
For a future Q&A question: Which do you prefer rainbows or sprinkles (make this go viral)
omg you should’ve made it like those icecream sandwiches you know??😭
I loved her tooth that she made a cat love your vids
I am so happy to still be watching your videos I have watched you since I was 5 years old and I hope that I could have a shoutout or just mentioned in one of you videos I just want you to say my name it would make my day the best ever my name is Olivia and I hope you have a grate day moriah I would send you stuff but my mom said no so ya.❤
who else thinks she should have painted little big feets toes.
please make underwear with George on it
for the mouth squishy do caine from tadc
For the teeth you can all make it different faces or something
YOU COUDVE DONE A RAINBOW CAVITY
Mr potato head would have been so cool for the bean body squishie! But what you did is so much more unique 😮❤
Hi from blind lady! I love youre funny sounds!)) ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You can do Caine from THE AMAZING DIGITAL CIRCUS it might be difficult tbh
My idea for the last squishy was to paint a merry-go round instead of the mouth
I actually really love the dentures one, it gives a weird gorey yet cute vibe and idk why.
What about the giant yellow blob?!
She should paint her organization bins
Two ideas, 1. Mariah should make a advent calendar with her with Xmas characters? 2. Dress up as one of her Xmas characters?
Peeps are bunny shaped, the tooth was bunny shaped, but she made a CAT with PEEP face style!
Nvm I couldn’t see the creases in the feet btw I loved this vid and I reacently downloaded spark ❤
Moriah can you you pls restock your planner  set because  I need  a planner  set ❤🎉😂😢
WERE IS THE SPRINKLE SONG????😥😥😥😥😥
Y-you forgot the sprinkle song 😭
giant peach could be a merry-go-round or a house or nafalofagus
The teeth made me think of the my neighbour totoro little characters
No sprinkle song
No sprinkle song?
⚠️GUYS!! LIKE THIS SO MORIAH SEES IT!! ⚠️You should do the big blue unicorn!!!
Make a tooth into a peep
Guys she forgot the sprinkle song!!!! But your work is amazing 🤩

I love little big foot 🥺🥺
BIG FEET PLUSHIE
we need a big feet plushie i would defo but pls make one 😂😂
you could’ve made the set of teeth an oyster!!
All of the individual teeth put braces and make it a braces teeth family
Pls make totoro please with the teeth !!!!!!
Hows opie?
She should make a whole collection of squishies with those feet. Call them foodles. (Foot-Oles)
So where was the sprinkle song….also you should make a lil cat family with all the teeth it would be sooo cute
I thought you should make the mouth a clam
The mouth squishy, she should’ve added braces
Ideas for the squishies you've been avoiding:  🚙🚘🚗: turn them into cars for your characters, like you did with the trift store dessert houses  🦷🦷🦷: cut them in half and create something new using the 🦷🦷 halfs  🍫 People : remove the limbs and face then turn them into naufalafagus 🍫🍫
YOU DOTI😮
I am Nadine and I love your videos and your funniest videos 😊
so satisfying. have yall seen DOMINION for spooky month? i challenge you to watch it without looking away, bet you cant :)
HERE ME OUT!!! ATTACH THE SQUISHY TEETH/MOUTH TO ONE OF THE MASSIVE UNICORNS. AND YOU CAN NAME HIM YAPPER 10000!
that ain't no gudetama
I’ve now watched you for like 5 years ❤️
do the chocolate ones and make like strawberry flavored or chocolate and make cute faces ❤
I have one of the unicorns, a squishy
the been body is so werid its cute
i think moriah is...See More
Make the teeth in to your blob characters
Why the cat? You could’ve done Totoro
did you add ur signature on the first one?
Moriah u should have used the rainbow for the feet
me: 🤚 :Mariah: no question put your hand down :me: ok😢
Hi I haven’t watched the video yet I’m just commenting so I don’t forget so you can ignore this if you have already done it 😅 buttt for the giant peach squishy you can make it into a pumpkin for a cute Halloween decoration (and maybe you could add some life into it?)
Make a set of peeps 😢
okay its kinda cute......
Eeeeeeee no 😔😔
i loved the secend one the most
i did not like the first one cuz u ruined the cute thing
but i love all ur paintings and ur an amazing artist
am not going to lie i did not like the first one at all sorry
could've turned it into a monsterrr
I feel bad for the peoples squishys we’re sent and she said she hated it lol
When you flipped the tooth upside down it looks like totoro you should make one as totoro
5:39 PAUSE HERE SHE MADE MAMMOT MY SINGING MONSTER WITH EARS
I was hoping to see a lil food squishy in the mouth one
Ramdom thought moriah should make her own costume squishies ansd sell them Who aggrees?  👇
I love her vibe and her art anytime it’s a special holiday or I’m just down I always think to watch her
I expect the mouth to be turned into a macaron
.
She makes everything cute pls teach us pls
Medium feets?
You could turn the teeth/tooth upside down and make a derpy bunny 😂
The first one should’ve been a pastel green 🦖
I think you should turn the dentures into a clam and maybe add a pearl
Dentists would reccomend the tooth and teeth squishies
I want the cat! 😍
What happened to the sprinkle song?
i want a little big feet plushie now
Am I the only one who finds it funny that Moriah used to say things like “I hate using hot glue on squishes unless I have too” and not she uses hot glue all the time 🤨
WhAt  HaVe yOu DoNe ToGuDeTaMa 👁️👄👁️
NO SPRINKLE SONG  THATS A CRIME
I would’ve put the mouth in the peach
Upside down tooth looks like Totoro!
why would you do the feet ones 😥😓
Why are there so many teeth squishies ??????
Ok I love the sand bunny. Is it just me.... Or is it ADORABLE!
I had the chocolate bar one 😂
about the teeth.maybe you could do a tooth fairy? like maybe put some wings,a crown and a wand and maybe it will look good?
She should make a "yearbook" full of all her characters, the seniors could be the oldest squishes, etc etc. (an awards section, such as class clown, hottest couple, etc etc.) Original Commenter: harmless potato
Paint one of your panda squishes and make it a red panda PLS 🙏🙏🙏
You should dress up the tooth squishy as a fairy so it’s a tooth fairy
She should hqve made the teeth into caine from digital circus
Do another one😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love your vid, the paint part its too satisfying
you could have made the inside of the mouth look like an oreo maybe?
Do some Halloween squishys
My only question is why do you have to put your signature on a squishys butt
i hoped timelines idk what a squishy is, but it’s the wrong word but it’s all i’m finding… i don’t remember what the other word is. it may just be three am but this is so weird . idk why but it’s wrong 😭😭
you forgot the sprinkle song on the cat
I think that denture could of been turned into a cute taco. Turned vertically  it reminded me of a taco or a type of desert.
PLS MAKE A TOOTH INTO A HORSE
You should’ve made the teeth into a taco
i love little big feets
Hi 😊
You could have maid the set of teeth into a dessert toco and the white teeth could have been frosting
✋
Oh my God I love your videos please tag me
**AN IDEA** IF U GET ANOTHER MOUTH SQUISHY U CAN MAKE IT INTO A HIPPOO
make something creepy and cute. like put the teeth into like a bear squishy and give him like a scary smile.
You could have made the dentures into a muffin or cupcake 🧁
I personally don’t think that about people saying about the bean body’s I love them🎉🎉😂❤❤❤❤❤your so crative and kind don’t worry about peoples opinion just in joy the moment 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤😂your so funny ❤😂🎉
Do a squishy makeover please🙏
I’m nine so sorry for the wrong spelling 😊 but I tried
I’m so glad you faced your firs 😂❤I like how you turned a tooth into a cat😂😂
😂😂😂
Can you stop making an alien😅😅😅😂😂😂😢😢😢
The teeth could be a dessert taco
Pleaaaasssss make some big squishies😭
I have a suggestion for your whole Mouth teeth whatever it is- U could snip it into a burger or a macaron and change the color if u want
She forgot the sprinkle song😭
Pleas make more teeth cats it’s adorable 🥰
anyone else saw that she could have made a layered cake or huge macaron out of the dentures, total missed opportunity
please name the bean body frooty❤❤
11:41
The sprinkelsong 😢😢😢
4:50  It looks like that potato from toy story with that feet
I love Little Big Feetsss so much :’]
The bean body was soooooo cute!🥹
Totoro!
Lil big feets
Do a fnaf squish day 43 of asking
I used to have the chocolate bar squishy as a child😭😭
Mauw
You should have made the mouth into your own grills
I love little big feetsss
Take the teeth squishies and turn them upside down, cat
but they desored it
i love that unicorn kitty
I love  Moriah Elizabeth  she is so funny and talented😊
So to be clear, the bean-bodies & the blobs are 2 completely different species? Correct?
wait... the tooth kitty does not have a tail lol... love ur vids <3
The first one is giving pota-toes before panting 👣
the upside down teeth would be perfect for totoro!
Need more teeth and feet makeovers ❤❤❤❤ thay were to cute❤❤❤❤
8:40 TOTORO
I am hoping you are going to do a part two and if you do can you do a big squishy?!?! Pleaseeeee!!!!
I love the teeth squishes so cool that you can turn something so out of ordinary stuff that is cute and turn it into really cute squishes!
I love your videos
Can you please make a part2 please 😖
No, whenever she said, she’s creating a alien bean body she was really creating Mr. potato head
When you said put your hand down it got me😂
Does anyone else think the bean wouldve made the perfect Mr. Potato head?
When I saw the mouth squishy my first thought was to turn it into a clam/oyster with like a pearl inside. Maybe a potential repaint idea if it ever needs it?
😢 Can you do a cute rainbow  chocolate bar Please
I loved the first squishy but just a suggestion you could've made the potato guy from toy story
Gouatama is dead you disobey him :( but you do you
I love you ❤️💕
You should of made the bean a mr potato  man
The last one could be as if it was chewing rainbow gum or something 😃
Rainbow peach
For the teeth you could have put a food squishy in them so it looked like they were biting the food
all i can think about is the possiblitiy that the mouth mightve come out with eyes and 2 feet to get rid of more feet
Flip the teeth upside down and turn them into little totoros 😊
Cat sprinkled tooth needs to be a pillow❤
the first one looks like a doodle from toontown 😭
😊
Tooth
technically you could have made the gum squishy a shark!!
This is so nostalgic I used to watch these at sleepovers when I was like 10
Im offended you didnt paint little big feets nails
On the teeth you could put food on it
I know that potato he's the couch potato Tayto Potato he's from the SMOKO brand
Chinchilla
I fel like she could of made the teeth at the end a kind of dessert kind of thing?, they all look amazing we love you lots!
Mariah please can you make squishes to put out in the stores   Name: -Sugar the strawberry -Olive the orange -Bella the banana -Kiki the lime -Bella the blueberry -Georgie the grape  (Yes i there are to two Bella’s) I want two  Note: the blueberry is sad because he I tiny compared to the others. The others are big and happy  Thank you  P.S. I love your squishy makeovers
Oh Uhmm ok
In my opinion u could have made the dentures into a dessert by placing like strawberry squishy between the teeth  And making the teeth like frosting
😂😂
With the teeth, you can make pincers 🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞🦞
WHY DIDNT YOU GIVE LITTLE BIG FEETS TOE NAILS NOOOOOO
If u look at the rainbow teeth from veeeery far away it kinda looks like a cake of sorts 😅😂
Turn the teeth into blobs
You should turn a tooth into  bluy
you should make pickle(other existing characthers as well) in ur universe/nefloguien
WHERES THE SPRINKLE SONG!?!?!?!?!?
I have the same mermaid cat squishy like you!
You should name the hamburger penguin Hammy
OMG with all the teeth u have u should put them all on a strong and make them have colorful braces and hang it in your art room as a garland or smth
PLEASE DO ONE OF THE MEGA SQUISHES 😂
As a normal human, I would think the teeth are disturbing
The teeth could have been a stuffed dessert taco
YOU SHOULD PAINT LITTLE BIG FEET'S TOENAILS❤❤
Make it raindo
What about braces on the mouth
It's my birthday on the 16th of October
"they're terrible, ugly-" *the cute music In the background: 👁️👄👁️*
How do I know where to send her squishys
Plsssssssssssss do the big chunky squishy
If you want to paint more teeth in the future you could flip them upside down and they could be little blob cats. And to use the feet you could make more big feetss (lol) in different colors, shapes and sizes and have them be kind of like the planet’s animals / squirrels / woodland creatures.  edit: Ouh, I hadn’t even watched the teeth part yet, but she had the same idea as I did! Great minds think alike.   another edit: I was waiting to see what you did with the dentures before saying it, but I have an idea. You could paint colorful braces on the denture squishy, making them different shapes (ex. heart, star, square, bone, flower, etc.) and colors. You could paint the individual teeth to match, each tooth having a different rainbow color theme, making a rainbow of teeth when all together & they match the denture squishy
Omg the tooth could’ve been baby Totoro
I have the same tooth squishy in the thumbnail
She could have made a cake of the mouth😅
am i the only one who thought the first one should me mr or mrs potato head??
I want to see a whole set of sweet tooth animals now. So cute!
I wanna see more of the teeth made into different coloured cats!!! Love it

2:05 is where u get chocolate 🍫:)
1:20 TEETH SQUISHIES
SO MANY TEETH!
The tooth cat looks likes kinda like a squishmallow 😂

You could turn a tooth into a two ended carrot next time perhaps
Who wants her tonmake á tooth series
Add a piece of bread in the teeth!

The chocolate bar squishies are supposed to be that one chocolate bar shopkin
Moriah you could have turned the teeth into an ice cream sandwich :)
My 10 year old said.. that you could turn the teeth into those marshmallow peeps😊
GIRL YOU COULD'VE MADE POTATO MAN INTO A BLOB 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I looooove little big feetss, just so damn cute omgee

Rainbow teeth!!
I think mouth would make a good taco 🌮

TOOTH FAMILY
“Put your hand DOWN “.      *me =‘ 😢😰 ‘*
Glad to see the fact that you still carry on with this series!

Please do uno cards 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Some of the teeth upside down could be a leek with a cute face
Nah  that's mr. Potato head 😂😂😂
the teeth/full set of teeth kinda looked like an apple core
the teeth if you turn them upsidedown it looks like the cat from kikis delivery service
She forgot the sprinkle song😭
I love little big feets so much-
I like chocolate people better then Shoppkins
you should have done tooth jems!
The rainbow sprinkle song >:[
Tbh the form of the set of teeth squishie reminded me a bit of a clam

Moriah collects bean bodys like how furrys collect fursonas
Tip can you make one of your teeth squishes into a cute among us character 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏plzzzzzzzzz
you did a bad job
I think little big feets is cute
Put the red teeth squishy in the giant peach and make a face!!!!
Covered in FuzZy😂
Why did you not make the rainbow tooth for your rainbow toothpaste 😢
am i the only one who loves lil’ big feets?
Imagine not having any context and hearing her unboxing going “I keep getting sent teeth and severed kittens!” 😂
Remember, when she made that video about toddlers and tiaras
the teeth reminds me of tacos 😂
The mouth one could have been a clam character. Or she could have made the inside of the mouth look like a carousel with her toons riding ponies or something cute.
Ngl the tooth reminded me of those mini Totoro’s
Moriah always says that she's not a professional or an artist so lets call her painterly pal or smth idk
The first squishy reminds me of the anti-rainbow monster
That's a bunny for sure
The teeth you could've cut it down to look like a macaroon?
with all the teeth she cld make a braces set
Can you do art with your right hand please ❤
U should make the other tooth into opie🐱
Moriah can you pleeeeeease do the velvet squishies I am very curious to see what can be made out of them
Where’s the sprinkle song ………….,,,…..
you should make a nafhalogion {i dont know how to spell it} forest and make big little feets  the unwanted leader bcoz his father told him he had to do it but he doesnt want to
DAY 6 of asking you to make a video of picking some of the spark creations and redoing it with your own ideas
The tooth squishy was the perfect shape for one of the little trolls from Totoro lol
For the mouth, I saw it as the teeth are clouds, top gums could be the sky, bottom gums the grass and the inside part make it a pretty scene
Not big feetsss looking like mort from Madagascar 👀
Could have turned the teeth/mouth one into a clamshell.
We need a gang of teeth cats
I havent watched her in a long time and im happy that she kept her original intro
Cat? No no.. Thats a bunny.
For the teeth you can paint colourful braces
YOU COULD MAKE A DENTIST ANIMAL OR SOMETHING  AND THATS THERE SET FO TEETH THEY WORK ON  Like with a. Cute coat and everything 😆
Do the big ones 🙏🏼
I love little big feets!
you should have made a ring box out of that mouth, it would have looked a little nicer
you could have done aa orange btween the teeth
AWW 9:20
that’s so cute! 7:08 😭❤️
YOU FORGOT THE SPRINKLES 😢😢😢😢
It’s a totaro
The first one made me think of the “one eyed one horned flying purple people eater” song for some reason even though it didn’t end up anything like that 😅
so good
make a pt2 and a tooth could be among us
So…. Who’s going to tell Moriah the tooth squishy can become one of those cream filling sandwiches that expose the cream in half of the bun
You should do going through wreck this journal for a fun vid
You missed the chance to turn em into mr/mrs potato head!!!
The set of teeth could’ve been a clam
you could make something like alien seashell from that teeth denture squishy
personally the set of teeth you could turn into a set of vampire teeth as in like the vampire diaries
should of made braces with little charms
Give me it!
THE FEET SQUISHIES ARE CRAZY 💀💀💀
The tooth upside down looks like the little white bunny looking thing in my neighbor Totoro 🥺🥺I love that idea
If you get another one of the full teeth one u should turn it into a clam with a pearl inside ❤
I would've added a strawberry squishy or some kind of food between the teeth. I love what you did with these horrid squishies though. Major improvement
SHE DIDN'T PLAY THE SPRINKLE SONG
love your videos 😍
9:40 ngl I’m loving the Tooth Kitty
1:33 oh my god my mom is a dental hygienist and would love a custom tooth squishy
The tooth looked like one of the baby totoros lol
Love the three thoigh if you didnt want to make the last one into teeth you could have made it into a clam with a pearl inside =w=
OMG! I love the tooth cat! It could be a friend of the tooth mouse! (In France, it is a mouse who picks up your first fallen out tooth and gives you something for it, just like the tooth fairy, but as a mouse)
Omg how just how are you so good at being God and reviving squishes just how how how just how
She is so talented!❤
The dentures could have been a macaroon
Make a Frankenstein with all of the weird and random pieces like feet and teeth etc
Little big feet’s is now on my channel! He’s FAMOUS!❤❤❤❤❤👹💋
please make a BIG human squishie next! we love you
She could have made a rainbow grill
The toes of those feet could maybe be used as a fancy mohawk or odd wings? And maybe you could cut open the teeth and have it biting something?
Moriah! U should do a giant squishy with the teeth. That would be crazy and use up the squishies.
Day 1 of asking to make a fun game with your character also love your contant
Can you paint❤ volleyball please ❤❤❤
9:06 sprinkle song??? 🥺😔💔
Its me i have that red
You could make the set of teeth one an ice cream sandwich.
Lol lol lol lol love your  videos
WHERE THE SPRINKLE SONG!?!?!?!?!
I love mr little big feets❤
WHERE DID OPIE GO? WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN AGES, BRING HIM BACK ❤❤
You can teach mini me about teeth! 🦷
Are you prego???
Omg she should do a custom advent calendar
I don't even care about this ś
I have an idea, for the hated teeth squishy make it into an macaroon!?
Hey Moriah how does one send a squishy to you for a squishy makeover
Amongus
laurenZside would love the mouth teeth lol
i think the blue on the bottom of the first one would be cute to imagine that it disguises its feet in water
Everything is so cute!
All these rainbows and nothing for the gays smh
The squishy that has big feet is DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE!!!❤
😢 because the blue unicorn is cute and you’re avoiding it.
With the teeth you can put it upside-down and make a series of cats! Another Idea I have is to make the peach into a planet❤! Edit: spelling
You totally could’ve added some eyes/ears on top of the set-of-teeth squishy and turned it into a creature with a big mouth going :V
I love
SOMEBODY GIVE HER A HAND SQUISHIE🤚
For the last one you could have done like a clam shell with a pearl charter coming out of it
the whole time i was thinking of the phrase “sweet tooth” lol
Moriah l have an idea is to make  a squishy themed by party and personality is super positive mood like exited🎉 please accept my idea
Could you do the giant unicorns in a series or make them family/friends or in same theme pls 😮
lil big feets looks like the burger king colors!
I am on my brothers iPad but I am left handed like you I am your biggest fan
hear me out... the open mouth could've been turned into a taco if you turned it on its side
i hat the bean bodys
Omg you forgot the sprinkle song😯😥
MORIAH PLEASE MAKE A BIG SMILE OUT OF ALL THE TEETH 😂
She should take some wood panels from the dollar tree and create like a little scene of the different like woodland and ocean woodland creatures in display it in her background
The tooth could have been a cute little monster if you used it the original way and added cute horns and maybe a tail of some sort. I still love the cat but little big foot is my favorite
SHE CREATED CAMRON THE CALLICO CAT    Btw I made a bunch of typo but not removeing them because I'm lazy 🫥
These turned out so cute! I especially love the bean alien and the tooth cat!
The set of teeth -😥
Already watch this video but this is the closest video to the one that you made yesterday😠
before she said I thought turning them upside down would definitely be a bunny🤣❤
Like you said in my previous email that we would have robux😡😡😡😡
Əą ůý ģßą øńə
People are not the intended person in charge for any other information 😂😂😂😂
Omega is 3rd year old 😂😂😂in England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
omgggg we need a little big feetsss plush!
You could have turned the foot potato into an avocado!😢
Call it little feet
for the third squishy just add a face on the rainbow cheese and it could be like a little creature there
Babe
Give him a love  hart
bunny cat   catbun 🐰 🐰 🐰
Those teeth could’ve gotten some donations to be a taco!
I can’t with the “ GiAnt Big pOtAtO GUy 😂 “
You could make the teeth into those bunny chocolates by turning them upside down
It looks like a burger for some reason I don’t know why
What she could’ve done with the teeth is make them sweet teeth (sweet tooth) with rainbows and cupcake crumbs things like that I thoughtve that lol and wanted to share😅
No way u still exist 😨
11:03 what about a clam
The teeth could b a desert taco? It just a thought 🤷🏻‍♀️
Only real Moriah fans are allowed to like this comment
You should have cut out the middle part of the dentures/mouth. Glue it together and paint rainbow braces on😊😊
I’m tired of Moriah making the Benbody
Can you make a huge chicken, nugget squishy?
Can u pls do another baking vid plssss!!!❤
The last squishy could have been like a clam with a pearl in the pearl with a cherry
#little big feetss💀🤣
😂moriah is so funny
Do a tooth- tooth fairy!! 🦷 🧚🏾‍♀️
You missed the chance to call lil big feet, small hands 😂, btw he still came out good tho
Not me  HAVING the exact chocolate people keychain squishy WITH THE SaMe CRACKS
Those chocolate people r so cute🥺
"Little big feets" 😭💀help- shes too funny
couldve made the dentures a purse
OOOHH I have a nice idea 💡 that you can make the teeth and gums look like a cat cave or any cave and in the mouth you could paint and animal to make it look like it's peeking out ✨  Hope this helps or reaches to you I'll love if you put my comment in a video thank you ✨💖 ❤️💜❤️❤️
firs t.
:D
If you get another mouth you should do like a squishy inside like it’s getting ate
The tooth upside bown totally reminds me of Totoro
What about since they kind of have the shape to among us
Moriah, I have a random idea for you dentures! 😂 cut a whole in that giant peach and put them inside! Make it a giant weird face with dentures! 😂😂😂😂
His name is Tom or Jim
I think the teeth one was a a cute idea! My idea is a lot more cursed so I’m glad you did this instead of cutting a chunk out of the peach and putting the teeth in there
The teeth could be pudgie fish
Take the big teeth/mouth and put it in the peach to make a big face
i’m actually so surprised you didn’t turn the mouth into an animal in a costume LOL
Sweet tooth!!!!! Use this as an idea for some teeth
Hi I showed to my grandma and can you pls do an art class you probably won’t see this but if you do pls take into consideration 😊
you better be smiyling hahahahahahahah >:)😈
Little big feets is my new favorite character of yours
The tooth that you made as a cat is pretty cute to me i like it
I did not know she knew who gudatama was
i am very bothered when you made the first tooth squishy. you didn't play the sprinkle song!!!! love your vids btw
I was hoping the set of teeth would become vampire teeth
I love little big feets🤌👵🦶🦶🦶🦶🦶🦶
Lil Big Feets is so adorable like a little cute sock monster
did you name the other cat before you made the cat in this video?
Moriah could you make a custom snowglobe?
the tooth looks like a bunny
Tooth shape squishy = amongus
The tooth upside down looks like the smaller totoros
She could have put the dentures in the mouth of the unicorn...
can you please send me a feet squishie 🥺🥺🥺🥺
10:05 you clould have chapel the teeth into a seashell🐚!
The upside down tooth looks like the smallest totoro
You should have made the mouth a clam😊😊
I love foot Alien dude already 😅  edit: Braces design on the tooths/teeth is an idea I had
PLEASE MAKE A PICKLE PINK SQUISHY! 🩷💚🩵💛
what typ of pant to do* yo u se
Please you are over doing the alien ben bodies
I LOVE LIL BIG FEETS
Did you watch the slick slime Sam video? With the grilled cheese that was rainbow???
The teeth could be turned into among us characters lol
You could make them have crowns and into a king queen and such
The full mouth of teeth could be turn into a clam with a pearl on the inside 🤷🏻‍♀️😄😄😄😄
“ Omg IM sO tIRed Of heR MAkinG ALIen BeAn SQUisHiES “ omg that just makes me laugh so much!!!
I try to do a squishie maker for the first time and i did okay i just? AND BELIEVE HER WHEN SHE SAID THEY TAKE FOREVER IT TOOK ME 3 OR 4 HOURS  *i was a smaller squishie*
you can make the teeth little standing aliens or blobs!
Please do a ‘Tooth’ Fairy
What if you turned the tooth set into a weird looking taco?
Those are a huge improvement from the original design
Finally! A cat❤ I LoVe IT 🥰
Don’t be dissing Lil’ Big Feets
Maybe the teeth squishies could be turned into like the cousins of blobs. Tlobs or something. Like little animal ears/hats/food really any accessories could be added to hide the rounded top of the tooth and the little spikes can be the feet..?
hi i wanted to say you make me happy every times i watch your videos so i made my own  blods so i made brownie and a ice cream with sprinkles of course. so they got married and had a  child , it's a brownie with ice cream blods onit.thank you
The mouth squishy kinda looked like a macaroon ngl
You could turn the teeth into lil men. Add arms and use the roots as arms.
OMG THE TEETH SQUISHIES YOU SHOULD MAKE INTO A LITTLE GROUP OF FRIENDS OR A FAMILY!!! (Making A super clean ‘perfect’ tooth, clumsy yellow tooth, a sad tooth covered in cavities, a nerdy braces tooth ext.)
you can make candy corn out of the teeth
Where's the sprinkle song!?
I love it
She should use the feet to make Mr. feetS
The week you do not post the 7 it is my b day 😂
you should continue to avoid them
We could totally do a tooth fairy village with the teeth squishes! There could also be an actual princess/Queen there! Rival to the doughnut queen or maybe frenemies? It’s to perfect!!
that lil dude you attached the feet to was not gutatama but instead a lil fella called tayto potato! (/srs, look it up!) lol  but srysly lil big feets is fricken adorable i love him asdfghjkl ✨lil noffalogien cryptid dude💖
NO LITTLE BIG FEETSS❌ INSTED LITTE FEETS
The realisation of people turning it over and realised that it was a tooth
Lil Big Feets is freakin adorable
Why don’t you make a tooth with little teeth hairs 💀✨
U should try for the Guinness world record for the biggest squishy collection😂

i would have turned the teeth into a taco or make it look like one of the piggy banks where you get little animals or demones ect pop out  XD Maybe if you fet another one
An idea for one of the teeth: turn it upside down so it looks like a cat then paint it
the tail. what happened to the tail of the cat
Moriah: What kind of makeover is this?! Me: the squishy kind, this is squishy makeovers baby!
Mariah can you make a cat family out of the teeth squishes?
Girl is fabulous ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Anyone else notice she forgot the sprinkler song on the dessert calico cat tooth 😢
I’m meant teeth
Guys, she got that when I was literally zero years old
That cat is a calico rabbit!!!
I would have cut the tooth one in half starting in the middle part of the teeth than after you  get to the one square edge dont cute all the way through and glue the sides together and make it a cake or tart.
You didn’t do the sprinkle song
For the tooth I would have turned it into a Mokke from Toiletbound hanoko-kun wich is an anime😊
My first thought for the feet is to make those “ vacation magnets” like the ones with a beach scene and the name of the place at the bottom
You forgot to put the sprinkles song😡
There was a missed opportunity for a Mr. Potato Head squishy, and that is rather upsetting.
One day Moriah will own all the squishies in the world 😂
The one you put feet on you could’ve made it a blob
I love to see work HE HE HE
Please make an alien acorn for "LiTtlE BiG fEeTs"
If you flip a tooth around it also looks like a blob with long legs
For the teeth I was thinking you could play on the phrase "sweet tooth"
It looks more like a bunny
Little big feat 😂😂😂😂
DO A PART 2 and pant the big scwisheis🦄🦄🦄🍑🍑🍑
I feel like the mouth could have been a burger of sorts if you sand the teeth shape enough
If Moriah invites us to meet her who would come?👇🏼😄
Moriah just made a MSM monster....AND I LOVE IT❤
That alien being? Gutetama? Idk but the feet under it reminded me to the potato guy from disney
the mouth is by far the best in this video! it is truly a glow up. nice job
You should have done Totoro for the teeth
I like your videos but I beg of you to do a LARGE squishy :)
PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2
Who invented feet squishies?
Can i just say, she made that tooth squishy into a... sweet tooth 😶
Maria. Why didn’t you do the sprinkles song?   When you’re putting sprinkles on the cat where is the cheese? Whatever you’re going to call it
Moriah you should make a cartoon with all your little characters
You need to make more of these and you could paint a peach tree landscape on the peach
You should make a part two! you are the best part of my friday!☺
Considering how much she likes making desert themed art I'm a little surprised that she didn't make the full set of teeth into a cream puff. Maybe I'm just weird for seeing a cream puff in that squishy?
Mr. potato
The 1st one looked like a furby
Could of made tobor from shark boy and lava girl with the denture squishy
maybe she could make a video of using a bunch of the supplies she has in her art room she has been hoarding that she has no current use for.
Why do i feel like little big feets sounds like a weird combination of a horse and a cat. I cant really explain it but it sounds hilarious
The first one reminds me of nerds with the gesso before the other parts where added.
What was d first one (⁠◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠)
I was thinking about teef having a cavity but it's rainbow
Im a big fan
You are the best YouTube ever🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
She should make a hole army of all different colored peeps ❤
I would love to see a collection of those cats
i wouldve put feet on the dentures and make one of those moving denture toys?
When ur kids get old enough to ride a bike u should pain a bicycle helmet for them it would be so cute
I have that exact galaxy unicorn squishy in my room right now
Do the same thing again please
I have a tooth squishy lmao
should’ve put the feet on the giant unicorn smh
You should make rainbow braces with your characters on the dentures❤❤
I would have made vampire fangs on the set of teeth, for Halloween.
Do a sweet tooth series where each tooth is a dessert you haven't done!
I would have cut the teeth one in half and made it look like a compact
I understand that the first one had a lot of modifications and probably took a lot of time and work to make.  But I would have done similar body mods on the dentures.  By adding some of those feet to the bottom and some big round eyes on top.  Maybe a big whipped cream or ice cream dollop on top for a dessert monster that wants to eat you instead of you eating it?  Probably still would have been creepy, but maybe in a cute way? 😂
Can you make zippy come back from  your creat this book challenge please and also bring back burp I love him please ❤❤❤❤
Can you make a naufalofigus cupcake on your bake with me vids?
all those squishies were amazing but how funny would it have been if she drew one of her characters inside of the mouth
Dessert teeth cat family?👀👀👀👀👀
you could make the 1s u reject as spooky theme for halloween maybe itll be better if u fix em and theres ur excuse your welcome
Love you<3
You could have done a taco for the dentures, a skunk for the feet
8:33 the upside down teeht looks like a totoro from my neighbour totoro :3
30:40 THE WINK I CANT
She forgot her sea shell video :( PLS COMMENT BOMB THIS
Could of made the set of teeth like a food item like a taco or something???
Could’ve actually put braces on the dentures
It’s been over a week!
you can use the feet as wings 🤔
You can make the individual teeth into tiny Totoro’s from the studio ghibli movie my neighbor Totoro! It’s the perfect shape
Sprinkle song
I love moriah is so amazing and insperasionale she should be an icon to young artists around the world
YOU SHOULD MAKE A BLOB OUT OF THE PEACH!!!!! by maya heal if i see myself in a video
he just has a foot disorder leave him alone
I’m sad bc I sent you the feet.😢
This just reminds me how far we've come.. I've been here since like.. The D.I.Y, Homemade squishy, and Fake twin era
WHEN SHE ADDED THE FEET IT LOOKED LIKE THE POTATOHEADS!!
i NEED to see you make a fursuit. (totally unrelated to this video)
HOLD UP HOLD UP WHAT IF HEAR ME OUT WHAT IF U DO ALIEN * BLOB * BODYS PLEASE
I would've put rainbow braces on the teeth and cut into it to have a cookie or lollipop sticking out
YOU DIDNT PLAY THE SPRINKLE SONG 😭😭😭
I thought she was going to turn the tooth into a literal tooth fairy and the denture into a mimic chest!
love entro
It’s so funny cus I love these just how they are! I love weird stuff lol my favs are the teeth, the velvet & the ‘creepy’ candy bars; I think they are cute!!! 😻🍰🍒🍫🦷 also the mouth could be a happy lil oyster; teeth for the shell & inside for a little face.
It’s so sad to watch you destroy the adorable godatamah T^T
Rly thought she was gonna make me potato head
Little big feets is actually adorableeeeee
And my b day is in a week
And my b day is in a week
Your my fav youtuber😊🎉
Make a pushen cat out of one of the teeth plzzzzzzzzz!!!!!!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I agree with Moriah with EVERY WORD she says (I also hate the feet 🤐)
Could say the last one tasted the rainbow
You can turn the set of teeth into a Halloween themed squishy
I almost.jumped out of my socks when I saw the set of teeth
Me watching here giving the denchers a makeover “MAKE IT A ICE CREAM TOCA!👹”😂❤😊
Your would have out faces on the teath or a face in the rainbow
The tooth upside down looks like totoro
The fact the denture squishy wasnt turned into a dessert taco makes me cry a lil on the inside
1st one look like a mr potato head before painting it
You don’t already make a bean body merch
Omg you could have made the bean/gouda tame/something?      Into a Mr. Potato head! And the mouth a macaroon
I feel you moriah!
She could’ve put a hamburger in the mouth
Thinking about how she couldve used the feet on the teeth to make one of those weird walking teeth toy things
-Spikadonnafootasaur -Turn a Tooth into an amongus character -Make the dentures a cute clamshell
Could have made the mouth one into a clam? Though it would take a lot of adding and cutting/ glueing 😭
It’s a sweet tooth :)
Moriah Elizabeth, please please please please make a Gouda Tama squishy
MORIAH PLEASE ONE OF THESE DAYS DO THE BIG SQUISHES!!
Cat tooth family?
Why did Moriah Elizabeth stop posting for a while?
You should put a tooth/foot in the claw machine
I thought it was going to be Mr Potato head 😊!
Hi
I know I'm insane, but I absolutely love Little Big Feets
Could of made a taco wit the teeth
I don’t know, at one angle the teeth look kind of like when someone takes a cupcake and rips the bottom off to put it on top like a sandwich.  I mean that as a positive note.
Moriah what happened  to the giant blue peach??!!!???
sshe is soooooooo funny
U should use the Giant unicorn squish's to make squishy versions of those little unicorn charm things from the newest claw machine video
You painted sprinkles and didn’t play the sprinkle song
Alrighty: Concept for a different tooth makeover-- a sweet tooth (Like literally, covered in candies or frosting or smth lol)
Turning a tooth upside down looks like the smallest Totoro in My Neighbor Totoro❤
i remember coming home from school every friday grabbing my ipad and watching her videos
Just a few years ago, my child  will wach Maria at bed time 😂 and she gave Maria a nick name, thats is squishy, gurl not girl GURL 💗 some times I call Maria the same ❤😂🎉
Stop doing ruf sound cuz when I hear it it’s like my phone is ringing THATS ANOYING👺
you can flip the teeth around and make them into cats, the dentures could be a pastry if you trim a bit, like a creampuff, and the feet, could be cut up and used as pieces you can connect to different squishies.
You should have made a taco out of the mouth squishy but I love ur vids
The tooth kitty is cute 🥰 For the denture teeth I was thinking a boa bun? Maybe you could try that next if it's work
You can make the tooth into a rainbow cavity 🦷❤
I ADORE the tooth calico cat its so CUTE
Ooh couldve done the teeth as a cave and made it Little Big Feets home.
U should put the mouth squishy into the peach squishy to make some weird monster thing
You should name the woodland creature'small feet's
Just the gaslighting through the entire video is perfect 😭
for the calico tooth cat, you could name them Caramel and give her a twin with darker brown colors and name them chocolate!
I love the colors you chose for the little big feets creature 🥺 I now want him lol
You missed a golden opportunity to do a sweet tooth with the actual tooth ones
you could have turned the moth in to a cave btw it verry hard to get this to sound kind im so so sorry :(
I have an idea why don’t you download squishy magic it’s a really fun game you can decorate squishy’s and you can even get your own pack
Hi Moriah, I love you channel, and just wanted to give an idea for one of the squishies you did, So here you go. For the mouth/teeth Dentures it could have been a Halloween themed Squishy, like it going into a pot of witch soup or something like that. Idk, just an idea!
Idea for the mouth make it a sandwitch bottom and top the bread and inside ingredeints
For the gum tooth one you could have made it an Indian dish called as 'vada pav'.
Big feets is slaying so much
I actually really like what you did with those teeth. Much better.
You could put the big mouth inside the big peach and make a terrifying  halloween-themed squishy with those 🕷🕸🦇🍊
U missed such a good opportunity to make the teeth a "  TOOTH fairy "  By like putting wings on it or something
Would've loved the set of teeth turned vampy loll still turned out great!
I wish your kids were on your channel😢
You’re welcome that we asked you to do this 😂😂
Next squishy makeover of the ones Moriah hates: giving the dentures braces
I think you should make a video called make a squishy
Finally da teeth
I feel like the teeth ones, like what you called "standard" flipped with roots as ears would 1, make a very cute Totoro and 2, make a very cute cat creature honestly
AAAAAAAA WITTLE BIG FEETS
When she said "hello welcome to your last day on earth" had me laughing so hard lol
I thought u wud make a taco or ice cream sandwich out of the teeth set
Square paint 2part 3part 4 part
This is body horror for squishies🥶 Love ur videos tho!❤
WHY DID WE HAVE SPRINKLES WITH NO SPRINKLE SONG???
I will BUY the teeth squishies off of you
It’s crooked, he’s crooked
you Could of made the mouth a cookie
When the cat unicorn thing tail is your own pride flag .
I had no idea there was such a thing as velvet squishies
Lil big feets is my nee fav ❤❤ 😢 love him

Hi Moriah I just wanna say thank you. Thank you for posting these videos. They have made me smile in the most rough times in my life. When I thought that nothing was going to get better i would see one of your vids I would feel so so happy. Your one of my favorite YouTube channels. So thank you. Thank you for saving me
Done at home and then the other half is gone and I have a lot going around in my car so I’ll be in a little
make the dentures a ice cream sandwich or a burger in a burger wrapper
Moriah: Do you had any questions? Me: **raises hand** Moriah: put your hand down- Me: *n o*
I love little big feets 🦶🦶
The upside down teeth look like the little Totoro’s!!!
But...could the tooth squishies have potential to be transformed into cute bunny squishies? 🐰😊🧐 those roots be looking like ears to me!
Lettuce
I just finished watching sam and colby- and i thought  why dont sam and colby do a explore whit moriah- im just saying y'know
Moriah Elizabeth, you should paint a pop-it, pleeeaase. I love your videos. 😍
The tooth wearing sunglasses could be turned into an apple :0
I just realized she sounds like jinx from arcane
Lil’ big feet’s!
Lil big feets is is iconic
I am Disappointed that the Teeth and Feet weren't mixed into one of those Chattering Teeth Gear Toys. /j
I love little big feet
Why would one make a toot and foot squishy....? And why only right feet...? These questions shall never be answered. 🤣🤣
Moriah you should do a squishy makeover where you make squishies into emojis :0
I kinda wish you played msm cause you couldve turned the dentures into denchas wouldve been alot less terrifying
Pls do them
Everyone remind her to paint ornaments this year!
I HAVE A GREAT IDEA THE MOUTH WITH TEETH CAN BE A CLAM
WE NEED A TOOTH CAT FAMILY
for the set of teeth squishy, it wasn't bad like the bunny tooth one. I thought you were going to put rainbow braces on it xD, but I love it lol! <3
✨️LiL BiG fEeT ✨️
YOU should put brackets/braces in your teeth squishes
U couldve made the first one mr potato hea
You could have made the last one an Oreo
HIS NAME SHOULD BE LIL BITS😝
i wouldve made the teeth a clam lol
Also for the chocolate people, you should do dark, milk, white and rose chocolate!
2:17  WAIIITT!! I own the narwhal myself! It’s cute but.. mine has the horn ripping off, i dunno why and dunno where it is rn, but yeah, i own it.
Hope you get 10 million subs🤞🩷
Mariah if you have the guts to do this dare..... make something in the monotone color scheme.         Like if you want her to do it 👇
Why when i watch your videos I wanna be happy happy
Hai, Moriah. Amazing video. I think the tooth squishy looks more like a bunny.
It might have been a bit of a stretch and it would probably take a long time but she could have made the mouth into like a clam with a pearl that has a face in side but jt might take a lot of digging inside and sanding for the teeth
Okay, I had an idea for one of the tooth squishy, you coul make it a "sweet tooth"
THE GANG OF CREEPY CHOCOLATE BARS ARE BACK
I love ur Chanel so much your soooooooooooooooooooooooo good and could do anything in art
The alien baby looks like a "my singing monster" character
i love your dessert cat! keep it up moriah
You could've made the mouth squishy a cake and the part in the middle could be like a filling or something
I love your alien bean bodies
Am I the only one disappointed that when she mentioned Bigfoot, that she didn’t make the potato into a cute Earthly Bigfoot character? Just me? Ok. 😢
My kiddo suggests as a Halloween spooky fun thing,  make some of the teeth in to Fresno Nightcrawlers. SPOOPY WALKING PANTS
Ok I have a better idea maybe you can get rid of the teeth and make it a purse? Repaint it though
Hey Moriah!! I think it would be so cool if you did a school vearbook of all your characters in the moment and like a quote or something. Its kind of random but i think it would be cute. You could also add a section where you can put the best couple, class clown, best dressed, ect... I really love your videos and have been a long time supporter of your channel!💕💕
The gum teeth one could have been maybe a oyster but q funny looking one😂
You should’ve stuck the teeth inside the mouth of the unicorn
the feet should hav been wings and the teeth could hav been a tiered cake with piping but idk for the tooth lmao
you bring back my childhood memories oh my gosh
you could have done some yellow shading in the theeth in the mouth squishy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
you could have made a pastel raindow cafate. im 9 years old
5:05 my teacher class be like:
You should get some fingerlings and repaint them as your characters  From 7 and 3/4 year old Jessica.
you should customise a keyboard ⌨️
ok but i love little big feetss
Moriah should make a character alien  for example : pickle's body, shelly's face and nilla's ears!
Cactus tooth squishie
You can make a carrot with the 🦷 by joining the two edges
Moriah u can paint the Milky Way in the opening in the set of dentures and put a nice color combination for the braces on it , idk how u will put braces on it but it a great idea 💡 😂
you could use the toes of the feet for fish gills :O
you could make a clam out of the teeth!
Can you combine the really big squishes into one massive squishy?
I really wish I new you made your own paint before they ran out😢
You should try to make the peach squishy nuafalufagus
LIL BIG FEETS!!
I love your channel
Moriah! i think you should turn the two huge unicorns and the huge peach into a Carriage car! and give it a cool fantasy vibe.
Let’s all appreciate how much work moriah Elizabeth puts in her videos
The blend the rainbow you made on the teeth is one of my favorites. And I say that my favorite color is “neon-tiedye-glow-in-the-dark-glitter-rainbow.”
For the dentures squishy, I kinda wanted her to add things and make the crocodile dentist game into a squishy
The upside down tooth makes me think of the little Totoros. The white and blue ones.
please please please do a jumbo  squishy makeover 💖💖💖💖🎨🎨🎨🎨👩‍🎨👩‍🎨
"It becomes something else"  "A TOTORO!"  "A bunny/cat"  😢
Here my out chip skylark from fairy odd parents
Could totally turn the tooth squishies upside down and make them totoros
To Olivia. I love😂😂😂❤🎉
I LOVE THE NAFALOGIAN WOODLAND CRITTER
It wouldn't surprise me much if someone sent you the same picture of Mammot from MSM 100 times if they're gonna send you teeth and feet.
Little big feets should be the new popular character 👀
Pop
Poppp
you could turn the mouth thing into a macaroon
I think the dentures could've been made to look like a pastry with the teeth being whipped cream and the gums being the pastry part looks good tho either way lol
Please make a glow in the dark squishy!!!!!!
OMG Moriah I love your videos so much. You problem won’t see this comment but if you do can I have a shoutout or something. I’m going through a rough time. Thank you
I love the teeth!gutatoma
Alien foot dude had some major seams lmao
2:32 THE SQUISHIE ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAS THE ROBLOX MAN FACE SMIRK!!!😂😂😂😂
NEW BEANBODY ALERT 🚨
Who thinks Moriah should paint a barbie dream house from one of her squishy familys.
Paint little sweets on the teeth! Sweet tooths!
I love Moriah's usual pastel palette, but it's nice to see her use bolder colours occasionally (within reason lol).
Day 1 of asking to make "squishies I've been avoiding" a series.
What about a caterpillar eating the big strawberry
Who else wanted her to make the tooth totoro 😂😂
You could do rainbow braces and put a lollipop in the mouth ✨
Shouldn't the tooth squishies already be full of cavities against all the desert/food themed squishies in the room they don't stand a chance
You should do a sweet tooth! You could make it a desert theme
Im not gonna lie, I saw the teeth squishy and I saw a Taco... Just me? Oh, ok... :'(
You could make the giant peach jerry the cherry
You can make a family from tooth Like a gold family 🔥   I love your videos❤🧡💛💚💙💜
you forgot the sprinkles song love denises daughter mwahahaha
The Mouth could have been A clam! You know with a pearl inside
So we arnt gonna talk about how she forgot the sprinkle song?
i dunno why but i thought of the set of teeth as a cake.
I love little big feet❤
You could have put a piece of candy or something into the dentures so it looked like it was biting something but I also loved these designs
I thought it was gonna be grimace…
You could’ve made the teeth squishy into a money pouch or wallet.
Congrats on your new baby ❤ looking forward to all your videos every Friday.
Okay, but for the set of teeth you could easily do a man eating plant, like in Little Shop of Horrors. Or even a Piranha Plant from Mario. Maybe next time!
I have been waiting so long for the 🦷 tooth !!!!
Yo yo yo
POST THIS WEEK'S VIDEO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
hey Moriah i have  an idea create a squishy and sculpt clay onto it
11:13  You could have made it look like a purse 😊
PLSSSS DO A PICL DANSOR CAKE
I love your vids!!❤️❤️❤️
I think he should turn the giant blue uniform into a cow
If you love Moriah Elizabeth      👇🏽
VIDEO IDEA Take the ‘donator’ squishies and fix them! :)
Hello I am out of the ordinary Also there was no sprinkle song when she was making the cat
I think we all know who is going to be the biggest loser for this year's showdown
Omg I love you Moriah marry me
I think the mouth squishy could’ve somehow been turned into a clam with a pearl inside 😂
Can you please make lime ❤
YOU FORGOT THE TAIL!  Poor tooth cat aint got a tail-
Big feet’s 😂😂😂
Can you decorate a rubber PLEASE
You could have made the mouth squishy into a dessert taco! You could have filled it with little squishes!
8:44 its probably the backstory of chiyo dad from azumanga
Not me wanting bean body plushies
@easterbunnyreject536 6 days ago (edited) Hello Moriah! My daughter had a great idea for your tooth squishy collection when watching this video! We felt it was a very “Moriah-like” idea: A dessert themed set of teeth - called your Sweet Tooth Collection!   Hopefully this inspires you to be a little more excited about working with them at some point in the future.  Also, a very belated Congrats!! to you and your expanding family! (all credits to original commenter)
you should do an uno set or decorate the set of the candy bars as the dino bars as your dinos as chocolte
i heat you🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
The one u turned into a cat it should be called a cakeao instead of a calico
Idea : add rainbow strings on the rainbow part of the mouth squishy
You could use the last one and make it in to a cake the gums are the cat the teeth are cream and the middle is the fullu
When that mouth was laying on its side teeth up, I could kinda see a pastry taco, with the teeth as a whipped cream or something
The kitty is so adorable ❤
hi im a big fan i have a idea that you cou8ld buy lots of sylvanain families.
The first makeover reminds me of a potato head in real art life😂 but it came out so cute though ❤
For me the tooth squishy is AMOGUS
Its a ……… bunnyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy😂plss 😊
If you ever get another one of those jaw squishies you can use some smaller food squishies to make it look like it's eating!
It’s finally friday yes post stuff
For the big teeth you should’ve used all the teeth squishys you had and made a scary looking mouth on the big peach and you could’ve made a halloween squishy jack o lantern

I thought of a name we could call your kids, instead of Mini-Me  and Micro-Me, they could be called Mini-M (the oldest) and Mini-E (the younger one)
You decorate sweets, cookies, cakes all the time, and you didn't think to paint a SWEET TOOTH??? ps bigfoot bean is my favorite you have ever done
I LOVE THE TOOTH SQUISHY

You should paint all your humongous squishy’s🤞🏻
You gave the car a butt!
Day 1 of asking you to paint Your family on Peg dolls 😅
hey moriah, i have something to tell you!  At my horse barn, we have a horse named moriah as well. she is having her first foal soon, and we plan to call it’s show name “little me!” (show name is the name they call during horse shows.) everyone at the yard loves your channel, so we thought it was fitting moriah’s foal would be called little me! haven’t decided on a actual name. Just goes to show how much you have impacted people!   Mama moriah and baby little me give you horse boops!   😊😊
Pls do !left hand painting❤❤ it be fun to watch! but it's your choice 😄
I've been watching this ladys videos since i was 6, and now she had a todler and is pregnant with another child, my gosh she's literary my child hood and nkw she had children. MORIAH WE LOVE U ❤❤❤

Hi there I just made a game with a big bubble to nafalagekisrt and it can vit 1000000000000 people controld by me
not trying to be annoying, but HOW COULD YOU forget to play the sprinkle song while painting your tooth cat?😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Kinda late to the party, but I would die for Big Feets
maybe you could turn the peach into a pumpkin for halloween
SHE DIDN'T DO THE SPRINKLE SONG WHERE WAS THE SPRINKLE SONG I NEED TO SPRINKLE SONG!!!!!!!!
You could have done a squishy they looks like the chatter teeth wind up toy with the mouth squishy on the feet
part two but the big ones
For the teeth squishy, you should’ve turned it into a cute little clam, just an idea. Theyre cute regardless, especially the calico!
If you do another video like this please consider this idea if you decide to take a chocolate bar person and customize it just cut off all the limbs and eyes and then create your own chocolate bar from that planet that that Martian Cat came from! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
hi moriah im a huge fan but is it fine if you do more bake with me videos plzz plzzzzzz
Day 295 of saying Moriah should go on Nailed It
I love this video, but......................... you didn't use the sprinkle song when you painted them on the cat/tooth
The upside down tooth is shaped like a Totoro 🥹
I feel like the weird bean body just looks like a bear in a pinata costume
Why does it look like a cursed scugcat
maybe make all of the teeth different themed cats
I love your squishy videos they're my favorite videos
I have the smaller version of the peach 🍑
Idea for the scary squishes make a halloween cake or halloween squishes
Honestly I was thinking a cute bear trap grabbing a leg like the bff's series for the teeth
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE MAKE THE TEETH A TACO
Who else thought she would add 'gold' to the teeth
why dont you lean into the creepy factor? its almost spooky season anyway!
omg you could have made the teeth into a clam with a pearl inside!!
you should’ve added like pastel braces to the teeth!!!!
Pac-man with teeth…
Hi I have an idea of a squishy a strawberry dinosaur and a kiwi dinosaur. I would be filled with joy and my sister gave me the idea to ask to do this she gave me the confidence to ask you-your friend E
I love your videos can you please please please give me a pin “ please make this blow up so she sees this”
NO I MISS A VIDEO SIX BAY AGO😫😫😫😫😫😭😭😭😭😭

Who else thinks Moriah should do the burrito monster? 😊
Do you ever play the squishy s do you make???❤❤
Naghflafelnougt Noun- An astronaut that travels to or from Naghfalafelgus
I wish the calico tooth cat was on the chocolate cat chess team
I love chocolate and caramel!!❤❤❤
For the last squishy painted, I was thinking we can make a cake🎉
The upside down tooth wouldve been perfect for being turned into Totoro!!!!
I love how ME comes up with ideas and uses them to make squishys then makes them look cute ❤❤❤
Moriah should make squishiest of the states in the world of squishies that she chooses randomly ❤❤😊
HIiIiIi sorry for not watching you’re videos but I’m glad I’m watching you now! Lol…😂
Can you make another year book of your characters please ❤️
The whole mouth could have been clam shell with a pearl
I LOVE LITTLE BIG FEETSSSS😂
as soon as i saw the tooth i immediately thought that it could be a cat
You were my childhood! I remember watching you last on your arcade claw machine project part 2! I’m glad to see you back in my home page 🥺
9:40  i would love have a whole family of that little cats
wait just saying you dont have to BUT what if you named the first one big foot mouse
You should most definitely paint those baby bottle squishes for the nursery!! That would be so cute for minier me lol she can have her own squishies
The fact that she didn’t make the potato head mr potato head makes me sad 😢
Rainbow teeth!
You should have cut the mouth squishy into half and add a desert between it , it would look like it's eating a desert 😉
8:31   I feel like you could’ve made the tooth a tooth fairy with like butterfly wings 🦋 on the back of it with a cute little crown 👑 on the head If you agree 👇
1:26 … put them upside down and then it’s the bunny thing from my neighbor totoro (yk the one)
Only moriah can make things cute
make a taco out of the set of teeth
Do  a series
Little big feetssss
the mouth could’ve been a tacooo!! the teeth might have a nice touch of 3d
Hello! So for the feet you could have done a feet octopus with a blob or circle but have the feet around it so it is a feet octopus!🐙🦶
You should customize a Basketball, and do different characters between every line😊😊
Hello Mariah! I just went and watched some of your unboxing videos, and I noticed you've gotten a lot of sea creatures could you do a video dedicated to sea creatures or ocean related things?
YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE DONKEY FROM SHREK WITH THE TEETH!
Moriah: Any questions? Me: *Raises hand* Moriah: *PUT YOUR HAND DOWN.* Me: ...puts hand down   Timestamp: 5:03
Teeth set could be an ice cream sandwich that’s melting!
Oh my god I fricking love little big feet’s he’s my favorite bean body

Day 1 of asking for a Q an A
.
The set of teeth almost look like a cake/macaroon/ice cream sandwich/klondike bar? Am I crazy? Probably.
The first squishy looks like a candy corn😊
Alternative title: Squishy leftovers
FWIW I liked this video😊
That was nice, I like the calico.      I have an ideas Idea: Can you make a blob squishy but do a pole for us to choose a theme.  Idea 2: can u do a squishy you have never seen before  Idea 3: can you make a scratch drawing ✍️ of your doughnuts village and I the the doughnut queen was born there  Idea 4: can you make an cat themed alien bean body  Idea 5 ps the last one: can you make something w/t shadow berries  Idea 6 I lied: can u do something with a Milk bottle   Idea 7 ok i really lied: can u make a s’mores cat  Idea 8 sorry: can you bake a shadow berry dessert     Ps: I’m sorry             Ps ps: can u bake more       Ps ps ps: can u do something in your idea list (again). Thank you for you time. PLZ read this it took a while
HEYYY for the next video u should do something with the nighttime sky bears!
My son’s idea for the last squishy: should have turned it on it’s side and made a cute rainbow taco
For the last squishy: missed opportunity, you should have painted the teeth gold!
Are u gonna do the Halloween  makeover this year❤
I have that same exact mermaid cat squishy as a kid.
Introducing ✨Lil BiG feet 🦶✨
Moriah! I just saw a shirt that had a little character that was a guinea pic with a unicorn horn - a "Guineacorn"! It was so cute and I thought of you! Maybe a new character idea?!?!?! ❤
She should make a “yearbook” full of her characters. The seniors being the oldest squishies, etc. There can also be an awards section like “hottest couple” or “class clown.” Original commenter: harmless potato. Blow this up so she sees
Day 1 of asking her to make a fur suit
get moriah to 10 mill pls she works so hard
you should put the teeth into the peach and make it scary for halloween
You should do a video where you repaint your oldest squishy

Moriah I love ur video hr amazing I love ur personalty  ur my childhood go to keep up the good work!!!
You could have made the set of treth a zipper just a suggestion ❤😊
as soon as you started painting the denture looking one i  was like, she should put them in the peach squishy. as a mouth. i am disturbed, horrified, and in awe of my own genius.
She CHEATED ON ONE OF THE TOOTH  IT 2WS A CAT NKT A TOOTH
Amazing just Amazing   Also i had a question but you shot it down 😢😢
You should use the other teeth for a cat family
Is this goodaytama ? 3:18
Attach them to another squishy, who may or may not need feet 2:51
Squishy roasting is going to be a very easy task 2:29
Squishy roasting it’s gonna be a very easy task
Can we appreciate how she’s here almost every Friday 😊
idea for the teeth: multiple teeth linked with a chain so it's braces and make each tooth have their own personality
I think it's funny how she said peep cat but peeps are bunnies 😂😂😂 you make me laugh Moriah ♥️♥️♥️
Hi Moriah :) This is just an idea but what if you make your cat as a squishy ? It might be basic but i think it might be really cute. You dont have to but it would be cool seeing your cat as a squishy and you can even add your own rainbow twist . I also have alot of food animal ideas such as a kiwi hedgehog ( since kiwis have little furry bits and hedgehogs have those spikes ?) or maybe a polar bear icecream, bear burrito , hot dog ( but make the sausage a dog ) . These are all suggestions you dont have to do any but they are just some ideas i had in mind .  I love watching your videos and i cant wait for next friday to see your next video!
She should make a yearbook for all her characters . Seniors being the oldest ect. There could also be an awards section like 'hottest couple's or class clowns ' like this so moriah can see❤
Hi moriah i love you videos i am hoping that my mom will get me one of these George, pickle, cousin durp for my birthday in April i think my theem is going to be moriah Elizabeth theemed this year since i love your art and videos so much ❤I love you MORIAH Elizabeth and your videos you have always made me  laugh when i was sad. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
U could use the feet for wings
I am so happy I found another person that knows gudatama
she made a frankensquish in the first half lol
Can you make a custom monaply pleaseeeee
The peach needs to be the planet naful-whatever the planet she made up. (It’s like the globe version)- so it’s more about detailed painting than repaired or changing its shape too much
You know you could’ve made then first one have two right feet right? 😂
Little big feets is my spirit animal 😂
Ideas for the tooth squishy, Sweet tooth. A tooth covered in candy. Tooth ache, An angry tooth. Chipped tooth, Self explanatory. Tooth with braces, Nerd core.
Everyone copy and paste she should do for her next video a comic book of her charactars backstory,school days or how they became friends 🎉
You should have added braces to the teeth! With a rainbow style coloured bracket
I have an idea 💡  You should paint 10 squishies each representing taylor swift eras ❤❤❤❤❤  Yes I am a swiftie xx
Hey, I don't know if anyone has suggested this but you should do a giant jerry the cherry with the big peach
Do an Elemental squishy like the movie!!
Moriah, you should give Georgie a friend (sorry if i spelt that wrong lol) name his friend Georgina. I love ur vids!!!
The full set of teeth, each tooth should be a blob!! 🥰
when I saw the mouth squishy all I could think was "It looks like it could be turned into a taco" lol XD
MAKE THIS A COMMENT BOMB! Moriah absolutely needs to make a monopoly board using her charcaters! PLEASE BLOW THIS UP SO SHE CAN SEE IT!
I triple dare you to sell these fidgets! 😊
I NEED A MONOPOLY BOARD ❤❤
is your married name Elizabeth or is it your maden name?????
Gutatama!!!!!
I feel like the teeth could have been an alligator? Just need some big eyeballs for the top xD
That was GREAT! TYTY ❤
hi moriah! :) howis melody shes so sweet
hi Moriah i've been watching your videos for YEARS and i've been thinking u should do a character for every key on a key bored sort of like how the rubix cube one went where u do it on pro create and stick them to the keys on your key bored i know its a big task tho so don't worry about it if u cant or don't have time because of your new babies who i'm sure are just as beautiful as you are love you love your videos. Maybe for the space bar u could do your alien bean bodies
She should make evil twins of her squishies as a Halloween special
The bigfeet looks like a monster from my singing monsters :)
Put butterfly wings on the backs of the teeth to create TOOTH FAIRIES!!
I love little big feets
Why isn't the mouth not eating a lovely rainbow colored dessert. Like an extra on clued in between.  Cookie or something. 😢
THE CAT NEEDS FRIENDS!
You could have made the set of theeth in to some kind of burger box that whas open
You should design a stalely cup sense you did a hydro flask
👏WE👏NEED👏A👏PART👏2👏
WERES THE SPRINKLE SONG
MAKE AN ARMY OF TOOTH CATS
You should make a mural of all of your favorite characters.”copy this comment so moriah sees it”
The teeth would have been perfect for the small white totoros 🥺
why don't you bake again please
Am I the only one who thinks the mouth could be turned into a lamb 🐑…
I love your  vid          so much 💗 💓 💖 😊😊     Mariah    you're     the best 😊😊
PLEASE MORIAH SUMMER IS NEARLY GONE! PLEASE DO YOUR ANNUAL SEA SHELL PAINTING VIDEO!!!!
Maria should make a body part Donna bucket 🪣
You should have made the dentures into a cake type thing
Part 2
The set of teeth could be a taco
(Spam this) IDEA MAKE A GIANT HUMAN SQUISHY AND A BIG MAKEOVER
How about changing the teeth squishie into a taco?? 😶‍🌫
Do THE. Princess of cupcakes please 👸 moriah I ❤️ your video s
i love big feet’s so much
Mariah you should totally make a dollhouse for you mini-mes doesn’t matter how old how young what gender dollhouses are so cute and so fun
t e e f c a t    : )
I was thinking of making the teeth into macaroon
I love your blog ❤❤❤
Anyone else upset she didn't turn the tooth into a "tooth fairy" by adding wings to it
Day 294 of saying Moriah should go on Nailed It
Omgg the dentures could have been made into an icecream sandwich! 😅
I sleep to these videos [idk how]
or, she is just the tooth fairy
Hi Moriah, I would love to see you decorate a Frank green because I loved the video of you painting on the hydro flasks
11:02  A clam might've worked
🎉
😢
who thinks moriah needs to do art on a stanly and sell it for merch
The teeth could be cats vs bunnies like baby versions of everyone from the one video where they were split into groups for a game set😂❤
I have been waiting for Moriah to use the feet for YEARS!! Since I think the first one appeared and Im very very happy you’re finally taking on the challenge❤ they look amazing❤
If you were willing to round out the back edges, I think the dentures could have become a clam, more specifically abalone!  I think the shiny rainbow part of the inner shell would have fit your aesthetic nicely and would have given you a chance to use some neat metallic paints!  Maybe you could put a small mermaid in there as well?
The teeth squishies kinda look like mini bunnies when they are upside down. Just a thought.😊  (Edit) I definitely commented this before she said it. Oops!😂
since there was 6 feet they could’ve been rainbow colors for yur kids room, like baby foot steps
Now you got to make a big big feets😅
The real ones knowing that the so called Gudetama is actually Tayto the potato haha
I looovvvvveeeee the bean body!!!❤️
I love the cat so much
It could be a oyster
Sprinkle song?
am i the only one who thinks she should do a video where she makes cases like ipad cases, iphone cases, etc… it would be a fun video to watch AND maybe she can produce it for merch and we can get a case made by her!   LIKE THIS SO SHE CAN SEE THIS!!
Video idea; customize a doll house for your daughters! 💘
Just Putting this out there But I was Hoping to Kind of have a update about Mini-me Just a though You don't have to and I know that people prob have been asking like a lot but just wanted to ask😐
The mouth eating the chocolate bar would be cute!
MAKE A WHOLE ARMY OF CATS!!!!  💕💕💕💕💕💕 COPY AND LASTE THIS SO SHE CAN SEE!!! AND LEAVE THE CREDIT NAME!!!   Original comment: WillowSharp_official
I was thinking you should’ve made the dentures vampire dentures :3
This is what I NEEDED in my life
It’s sad to see how much she went down in views
It’s name is prince you must protect him
Moriah is so funny and so creative  she some how has new ideas every time she does a makeover
Oh my God
Can you do a part 2😊
Morih should have made each tooth have a different job
idea for ur teeth squishies, you should namek one for your daughter (mini-me) once she loses her first tooth!! <3
I thought that was for sure going to be a Mr. Potato head
My name is Elizabeth
HAHA MORIAH WE GOT YOU TO DO HORRIBLE MAKEOVERS
Why is your cat look like a bunny?
With one of the teeth squishy’s, you can make a sweet tooth and you like decorate it with a bunch of candy I love your videos. If you don’t want to do it it’s fine.❤❤❤❤
Me love you soooo much. I found Moriah when I was seven years old and came to her channel every time she was going to post a video. I am a big lover of Moriah.
Hey Moriah can u plz do a video where u make the planet nofofogus map ❤❤❤
Hey Moriah can u plz do a video where u make the planet nofofogus map ❤❤❤
The mouth one would have been cool if you painted various little deserts where you put the rainbow!
Hey Moriah can u plz do a video where u make the planet nofofogus map ❤❤❤
❤🎉
You can always throw some rainbow wings on one of the teeth and make a Moriah version “tooth fairy” 😅
The cat made me think of my neighbor Totoro
I love the tooth kitty, she is precious and it's such a creative idea!
She should make a “yearbook” full of all her characters (oldest,newest,her favorite etc.)❤
The chocolate people are shopkins
with the denture ones, I would have found a ball or something and turned it into a lemon/lime? like the drawings of someone biting a lime wedge? I think it would have been cool
When I saw the teeth with the all white base coat I think you could have done a sort of oyster and pearl themed squishy idk
Hi Moriah! I know u might not see this comment but I just want to let u know I’ve been watching ur video from the very beginning and I Love ur videos I love ur arts and creativity I wish I can do that too lol. I do hope and wish u make and publish a COLORING BOOK of your cute characters! I would really love THAT! ❤😊
When’s the next restock on the paint I love to watch a Videos and I want to try your paint
Here's an idea for 'Little Big Feets': when they are born their feet are twice their body height and progressively get smaller as time passes. Meaning this Been Body would be like... a smaller teenager.
I love your videos <3
Name the cat calicoa❤
WHERE IS THE SPRINKLE SONG?????
I love your vids but I have something for you to do if you don’t have idea for a vid, I think you should do a squishy makeover but how you choose is you open one of your boxes that your fan sends you and do three or two squishy’s in there but it is the first three you pick up, and you can add to it and do whatever you want but the base is that squishy you pull out.
The tooth’s hands look like nasty teeth 😨😨😨😨 MORIAHHHJHHH
I had the bunny idea way back when she got teeth in a box!!! 😮
Hey Moriah I love you videos!!! ❤❤
The tooth u made into a cat kind of looks like a peep so maybe for Easter u can make them into peeps and take a box and customize a peep box and put the peeps inside
Hey Moriah? I'd honestly like a Q&A because I've watched another one of your videos and seen a HUGE argument about if you support LGBTQ+ and I'd like to know... do you? (DO NOT TAKE THIS AS HATE CAUS I SUPPORT LGBTQ+ AND THINK NOTHING IS WRONG WITH IT) Also I don't want to hear hate from homophobic people either, let people be them and BACK OFF.
What if u put a small human between the upper and lower teeth? Like his arms are trying to keep the mouth open to be not bitten... like a gummy bear 🤔
Those feet could make some cute flip flops?
This was an Awesome video
you should make lime or citrus
An idea I ketp seeing was a icecream sandwich or oreo cookie for the last squishy I know you make alot of those but that's what came to my mind
I loved the eyes before she Added the black dots and the white dots 6:51
❤ O M G  I'm waiting for your new video and I will always love your videos so much 💖😅
Can you paint the bean with feet’s toe nails
I would have had the dentures be like a cute little creature inside of them like a crab or something that replaces it’s shell with fake teeth lmfao
Tooth Me: Among us
I think she should use one of her planet squishes and make it into nafalafagis!!! COPY AND PASTE IF YOU AGREE!!!
Personally, I absolutely love Little Big Feets.
Where is the sprinkle song😡😡😡
What is yr biggest squishy?
Please make the peach Jerry the cherry with butt crack
You should make all the teeth cat and a tooth fairy owner
I love 💕
I really thought the first one was gonna turn into Zippy 🥲
You should make a tooth into a “TOOTHfairy”! Just that it’s..an actual tooth..
Can you please in the next video make 1 REALLY big squishy?
she forgot about the seashells!!!!!!!!
Ohhh do the big peach as a big picture of a bunch of little desserts at a carnival. Riding all the rides and a concert 🎉that would be cute. A lot of work but I believe in you!!❤
use the peach as gums for the teeth make a giant mouth.   edit: put the chocolate in the mouth
Pls make a part 2 💝😊
Maybe you could use the chocolate bars to put on top of cakes cupcakes ect.
Little big feet’s looks like a color version of “where the wild things are”
I love you Moriah! Youd’re humour: impeccable! You’re art: AMAZING and you’re just a amazing person in general!
Why is nobody talking about how she forgot the sprinkle song😢
Listen to me. I would buy a plush of lil’ big feets. I would buy one for me, and one for my friend. I LOVE HIM. GIVE US A PLUSH PLEEEEAAAASSSEEEE
I need to know, is Opie alive? 🥺

Hey moriah!❤ can you Pleeeease make a stich squishy???🥺🥺🥺
Moriah I'm going to have a panic attack if spark isn't released on samsung soon, I NEED it😭 love you smt❤❤
She should make a “yearbook” full of her characters. The seniors being the oldest squishies, etc. There can also be an awards section like “hottest couple” or “class clown.” Original commenter: harmless potato!!!!!!
Don't forget the seashells video every summer!
Hi!! I think you could the tooth a macaroni
you should turn all the teeth into a cat family pretty please i would love it because your cat is just so cute
Moriah! I think you accidentally mentioned your first daughter name in a video on the 26th of May
I want to start a (protect the bean bodies campaign) to stop people from hating on the alien bean bodies. who's with me!
The tooth definitely gave me ruby from max and ruby 😂
You should make a family out of the teeth squishies and some are bunnys and some are cats
Moriah  please do  OPIE  to Squishy  🐱
Moriah should make a Dominos set out of her characters.
Am I the only one who thought the first one would be better with painted toenails?
why dont you do fruity toothies for the teeth :D
Moriah will you ever be selling your deck of cards again? I still need 5 decks and try to remember to check periodically. I just wanted to check in to see if that is something to ever return.
You could make the other teeth into pirates!  Like gold tooth, teeth with gems on them etc and the pirate garb lol
you should’ve put a dessert in the set of teeth where the ‘rainbow grilled cheese’ was- like cut it out and put a desert in there
The teeth look the best in my opinion 🤷‍♀️
maybe u can turn the teeth into a creepes filled with chocolate and whipecream or make it a tacco ,the tith being the salad and the middle the meat?
Moria you should make a yearbook of ur characters!!!!!!!!! Seniors oldest squishys and so on 😼
you could do tooth fairy out of teeth
Wait - idk how good this is butttt you can make a JUMBO blob with the peach 🍑 !!!
LIGHT BULB IDEA!!! TURN THE TOOTH UPSIDE DOWN AND IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE THE MINI TOTOROS
I haven’t seen this persons videos in YEARS
the bean body looks like the tickle monster
Can you paint on a pumpkin pretty please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Bring the  cat backkk!
hear me out guys!!! cut the back of the denture squishy and make the top teeth a mushroom top, the bottom grass and the middle a mushroom house!!
I hope u can name the little cat toof so it reminds u that it came from a tooth just my idea❤
I wanted to download Spark, but it wouldn’t let me😢
Not gonna lie I thought you were making Grimace
you didnt play the sprinkle song!
That sounds like a rapper name"lil big feets"😂
u could have made the last tooth squishy like those pearl holder in the oceans
Nah guys its not a cat or a bunny. Its Totoro!
Could’ve don a nafalafagos creature of the sea they might be shellfish that or a cave
Moriah you should do a painting with all your least favorite characters like the face of failure, poor bill the cow flob etc!!
The feet could have been used on something like mickey mouse
The teeth/dentials kinda looks like a macaron
Mariah can you do more baking videos
The tooth-set, like the whole mouth, kinda looks like a scallop or a macaron shape
Can u make a tooth wearing overalls 😢
You should make a maching cute old lady to go with the teeth 😂
Ok to start off with the first one looks like a mr potato head fox with spikes    second looks more like a cateco bunny peep   3 i would of done a monster coming out of the teeth but its still cute with the rainbow theme.
I really wanted her to put the mouth squishy in the peach for some reason.. like idk why I thought that would be cute..💀
Hi Moriah,  Coming straight to the point, I think that the Gum squishy can be turned into burger buns or slices of bread from the NAFOLOGIAN planet 😁 It may need some cutting and trimming and also a bit of puppy paint, or maybe a lot.  I think it is worth a try
I need little big feets merch
HEY can you customize a pack of UNO cards plssssssssss
I really like this video! The mouth could have been a clam though.
THE TOOTH UPSIDE DOWN IS SMALL TOTORO. but really make a tooth into a tooth fairy
You need to paint the beanbodys toenails😢
Make a tooth fairy squishy
this is giving 2014 youtube and i kinda love it
5:02 na ita a me.potato toy anyone else !?
Can this pls be a series love you vids ❤❤
Hey Moriah, you probably won’t get this but I think you could make the teeth themed on your characters but amoung us themed, for the sets of teeth maybe deserts and for the big squishes I have no clue.❤
Can u make a angry lemon bag please
Moriah is such a talented artist she can make anything INCREDIBLE
Despite the feet, I really love Little-Big Feets. He’s super cute.
moriah is running out of creativity me thinks, that denture squishy could have totally been turned into a weird cake or dessert taco with a different point of view!
I know what a Nik name can be for your second child ‘me me ‘
WE WERE ROBBED OF THE SPRINKLE SONG
Day 293 of saying Moriah should go on Nailed It
Mariah should start having a rainbow song 😹 (been a fan for a while but never commented 😺)
Hey! My daughter says you should make a taco with the big mouth one, and i was thinking a cute clam!
You could turn the teeth into among us characters
you shouldof made the teeth into a clam
i love your videos  soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much if  you stop making them i'll die on the inside
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
The chocolate people are Shopkins
The face of failure is a lol doll
it's a bunny not a cat😋
Idea for your giant peach, carve a place for a face of a giant squishy to sit in it, it'll look like it's a character wearing a peach hat !
omg i knew they looked like cats lol
if any of you all have teeth squishing, the shape also reminds me of how twi'leks are drawn in simplified versions in-universe in Star Wars, like that little girl with the doll🤔
Gurl, your seashell video😮 or did u do it already?  if you haven't doit before fall!!
I think for the dentures it could have been cool to glue part of a food squishy to the odd place that you put the rainbow, then it would kinda make sense to have a mouth eating the food squishy though I suspect it still would have looked a little creepy lol
No sprinkle song?! My life is crumbling before my eye!
I was so hoping she would have put the giant dentures into the giant peach and made a character 😭
Bro the tooth looks like a mokie from TBHK
The mouth should have been a taco!!!
You could of made each tooth for the mouth squishy a bean bodied alien and the mouth could of been turned into a planet or estate for them or something 😂😂😭😭
the teeth in the last one could have been cats
Where? Is? The sprinkle song?
For the mouth you should of just added eyes on top 👍
For the standard teeth, You could also make an among us squishy... *wink wink* :]
Petition to make the teeth with a rainbow squishy Garreth or Garry for short  I V
A cute braces set of theeth in a pastel palet could work
Loving the concept and challenge of using squishies that arent a fav to make some awesome creations! As always, i enjoyed your video along with your efforts and creativity. 😊👍🥳 For whatever reason with the full mouth squishy i was seeing a potential for a clam shell?🤷‍♀️🐚 anybody else?🤔💭
☺
please paint the squishies from trow trow burrito
You should try customizing a doll like one of the monster high dolls
PART TWO!!!!!!!!!!!!
Omg i remember the peach :D
Please make a orange the fruit dinosaur squishy
Who's been watching Moriah Elizabeth since the old intro      👇
I have a friend who knows you too😂
Another idea for the teeth- "sweat tooth" a play on words
Is it just me or do the teeth upside down look like the mini Totoro
Hey Moriah when you going to make citrus into a squishy🐰😊💚
3:37 is ultimate rizz
Do be looking like more of a bunny, rather than a cat. 🦄
Taste the rainbow on whole other level
Hi merigha I am here to give you an idea can you please costomise a entre key board with your caracter?  Also: please don't bom this in her coments also not tring to horas her/you
Yuo could've done a cool taco design for the mouth, though it might've been a bit difficult.
I love how funny and creative Moriah is and her daughters are so lucky to have such an amazing mom ❤ i also thought that the mouth squishy could be turned into a cream puff but I love the creativity 🫶
also, 🥰 me like teeth squishes, though my recent comment has nothing to do with teeth, 😇 I slept with a tooth squishy hoping the tooth fairy would come 👀
ALRIGHT! 🥰 I tired my hardest to be “ SARWATASTIC” ( sarcastic) to make you smile. 👄SO, 😇 my bestie [ BESTI QUEEN 👹 ] told me an idea for your video’s. 🤓 though they were to lazy to comment it on your video’s [ I THINK HAHAHAHAHA ] 🤪 HEHE SO, so yo know a ginger bread house and those brown things and the frosting 🫢 MAKES ME FALLLLLLLL- 😍 well, WHAT IF YOU MAKE IT OUT OF MARKERS PENCILS ECT [ 🥺🙏 can you use the color 🩸 RED it in PLEASEEEE [ I have already requested enough * COUGH COUGH * ] then paint it do 😍 you! That’s all 😇 if you read this “ HAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII “
@morhia elizabeth can you do another painting pumpkin video???????????????????????????????????
Love it
Oh my goodness, my daughter had that little mermaid cat and it was her favorite. It broke and we tried looking everywhere over the internet for it and couldn't find it. I finally found one site and paid money to someone in China and never ever ever got my order. If you decide not to do anything with it, we would totally take it off your hands!
1
You need to do your Annual pumpkin painting please it is TIME!!!
You should make a ranking of all of your squishies
you couldve put braces on the last one
A cat family out of teeth!
you could attach the feet to the teeth, and make one of those chatter wind up toys, that would be cute! ❤
Me litterly downloading spark then it won’t let me sign in😢😢😢😢😢
Make the teeth into AMONGUS!!  ^ y’all like this so she sees it!!
I love Calico cake cat! Please, give her a family!
ay moriah i have a paint question is it okay if i swallowed paint water once asking for a friend
Do a sunset colored squishy!
just go off the rails and create some body horror considering the weird selection
So glad you brought back squishy roasting!
i love your work but, you forgot the sprinkle song!
I have a video idea for you Can you try and make a paper dragon puppet there's Hundreds of videos of how to make them And when you're done you can decorate it however you want
0-0
"I've ben sent so many feet" FBI agent: hmmm
MORIAH! I have an idea that i think you'll like! Personally, I would like to see you make a yearbook involving all of your characters! (or atleast most of them😅). I know this could be a very time consuming project so I wouldnt be surprised if this concept becomes a two parter. Maybe it could have different pages with things mentioning  'Jock', 'Nerd' or even 'Cutest couple' (Which would obviously be Shelly and Eusteaus) This wasnt my original idea, i saw another fan commenting about this idea. Credits to them! Note: Thank you for being such an uplifting person. Whensver im upset or angry, I never fail to see myself watching one of your videos. Keep up the amazing work! I appreciate your efforts❣
Can you make a part 2 of this because I like it
CUT THE PEACH SO IT LOOKS LIKE A MOUTH SHAPE AND CUT TO TEATH TO MAKE A MONSTERS MOUTH
even though you're going for scary, it still looks cute
OMG I LOVE THAT CAT!❤️👹 I shall name him nubs! Idc what you people who hate that name say me and the other slay people shall have his name as nubs!✨👏🏻❤️
The first one is me when I’m bored so I just start looking at a wall just lifeless
The dentures lot like someone tasted the rainbow 💀💀💀
How come that you didn't do that tooth its so cute
i love this video! though i had a instant idea for he mouth, if you get another mouth squishy can you turn it into a cake? also i loved the cat but wheres its tail-
Amazing girly
I was thinking that she would cut the middle part of the teeth out and put a different squishy in there and since it scary make it Halloween themed
I thin the tooth still loooks like a bunny
if you chop of the toes of the feet you can make them ears
I was hoping you'd put feet on the teeth like those teeth toys that hop!
The upside tooth reminded me of Totoro! But the dessert-cat works too
You could have made it a  taco
Make videos of you reacting to yours
I LOVE MORIAH SO MUCH
Let’s make a comment   Bom finish create this book 3 in one video
you could put black in the mouth too to make the rainbow look like strings of gum being chewed on
https://youtu.be/V51SSvoHsss?feature=shared
MAKE A TOOTH FAMILY
Make another create this book video
I got create this book 1 and two
I like how you painted the tooth squishy
May create this book 4
You should paint the squishy with fur on it
I think you should turn the teeth into blobs
Honestly the thing that popped into my head for the teeth squishies is the totoro spirits that look like cat rabbits.
Hi! can you decorate fake pumpkins this fall😀 😀
2:01 FEET?!
I LOVE LIL BIG FEETS
I feel like the dentures could have been some sort of ice cream sandwich or macaroon if you really wanted to transform them into something new 🤔
When I saw the teeth set all I could think of was a clam XD
Love your vids!!!you should make shootsand ladders but with your characters!!!
The tooth thing should have been an  among us person 😂
Change all the teeth to cats and call them the “kit-teeth’s”?
Y e s
Can you please do a big UNICORN please
She should to panting on her fake pumpkin 🎃
yummy
An upside down tooth also reminded me of one of those totoro mini sprit creatures! That could be a thing!
Moriah you forgot the sprinkle song!
OMG Moriah! That  bean body is reminding me of FALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Its cute though!
Her voice is sooo soothing I fell Asleep to her voice

Just a quick question about you are you Asian ?
Where is your twin sister? She’s a twin like where is your twin sister girly
You better make another cooking video or are or else I will find you😂😅😊
You can make an alien been body out of a tooth squishy
You could of done a clam with a Pearl for the mouth one x Edit: /oysters
Omg!  @moriahelizabeth! You could make Among Us characters out of the teeth!
Aw I thought u were going to add sprinkles to the teeth and make them a sweet tooth but it’s oki it’s still good ❤
I really this she would make a yearbook with every years characters  And a tooth dentist
You should make more-of  the aliens benbotys in to squishes
We inturdouce to you.....THE ALIEN BEAN BODY #PICKLES LONG LOST SIBLING😂
I ❤️ U   you make me happy🫶 be happy have a good life l ❤️ U   4life i hope you have the best life you can have you Are the best❤️
Can you do another thrift store makeover please please please please please please please please please
It would be cool to go back to the mouth and make a rainbow grill with some of your characters on it
I had an idea for the denture squishy as soon as it popped up in the video…. It kinda looked like a slightly open clam shell
It’s almost time to do your annual painting pumpkins
You should become gorge🍍 for a Halloween this year!!!!!!!!!!!
I I love you
I am just glad that you didn't give one of the large squishies the teeth.😬
Should've made the tooth into totoro
ITS BACK 🎉🎉🎉🥳🥳🥳
You should have made a donut in the mouth!!!
Can you do a mouse squishy (make its eyes popping out of their head and ears in middle of eyes)  Hope you do is I love your videos Ty for your content:)
OMG YOU SHOULD MAKE THE GIANT PEACH INTO JERRY THE CHERRY 🍒!!!
I was hoping she’d make a little monster out of the teeth 😖 put some of those feet on, find some donor ears and pain the eyes peeking out of the teeth- Woulda been cute for Halloween!
The cat/tooth squishy is so cute! But for the teeth with gums it would've been cool if you did a clam with a little face or something, but it still looks super cool
Haven’t watched the video yet, but adding details to the teeth to make a literally tooth fairy!
you could do a Mr and or Mrs potato head pair with more of the feet
The first one was adorable but they’re all amazing but then again there made by Mariah Elizabeth witch is YOU😂❤love your Chanel btw EDIT:ignore my old,terrible spelling 😃😀
you should do a “trying origami” video I would PAY to watch that
please turn little big feets into a plush
I’m Sikh of it
I have to say Moriah I am kind of getting bored of you so your going to up your game a little bit. You need to try something new or your going to lose a fan😢
Do you know esoalño
for making the jaw squishy a little more interesting u could have put a fruit or dessert squishy between the teeth like the teeth are biting it <33
I just install a game with sguishy and  i was thinking is Something from You becuse i see the unicorn whith moon and now i know You are the BEST
no  sprinkle song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Moriah l think you can put your characters on each and every tooth
I’m envisioning the teeth as blob characters but standing
You should turn a tooth into a fairy litteraly
It would have been so cool if your painted one of your characters as food being eaten by the teeth
You forgot to pull up the hopeless bin 😂
Where was the sprinkle song😢
Your pregnant again I can see your belly😮
LITTLE BIG FEETS IS ADORABLE but it looks kind of like a furby (in a good way)
Moriah! You should add some treats or little characters sticking out of the dentures 😂 Or maybe the dentures could be biting into a cupcake or something 🤷‍♀️
what about SWEET TOOTHES ??????? AND THEY CAN REPRESENT DIFFERENT DESSERTS
heeey moriah i was wondering what digital app you use
Paint a cavity 🤣
You should have put a dessert into the mouth like it's taking a bitz
Saw the dentures and my first thought was macaron😭
1:36 help i used to have one of these 💀
As a dentist, I love the tooth & teeth squishies... 😂
Can you go to England and then Nottingham
Can u do all ur characters haching from eggs just like u did last year pls also love ya❤
am i the only one that thinks that the dentures could have been turned into a clam?
You could do a tooth fairy but as a tooth
U should make the teeth among us
Moriah soon please do another pumpkin painting
Maybe a “sweet tooth” collection?
I was thinking the mouth squishy was gonna become a taco 🌮 of sorts (probably dessert lol XD)
Moriah can you please do a collab with LaurenZside please?
could you pls make a family of tooth cats!
YesYassssss
Could have turned the mouth squishie into a thick taco 🌮 the teeth could have been lettuce and tomatoes and sour cream and the inside could have been ground beef
Please bring back the Shelly and Eustace plushies! Preferably smaller but it doesn’t matter 😅❤ love how cute your backround is
Those teeth and feet could be used for something halloweeny 🤔
omg u should make a little totoro out of the tooth!!!
i was thinking for the dentures one to make it look like it was eating a bunch of candy, then you wouldn’t have to worry about the weird middle part
Wait a minute you’re using hot glue isn’t hot glue really bad on squishy’s because it creates a hard thing in the middle or is there fabric hot glue now? explain yourself!!  OK yes I have just looked it up and it turns out that there is indeed a hot glue for fabrics but I am unsure if it works on squishy’s, however
Hey Moriah! I saw that @easterbunnyreject536’s daughter had an AMAZING idea, so copy and paste her message so it becomes a reality!!  Her comment:  Hello Moriah! My daughter had a great idea for your tooth squishy collection when watching this video! We felt it was a very "Moriah-like" idea: A dessert themed set of teeth - called your Sweet Tooth Collection!  Hopefully this inspires you to be a little more excited about working with them at some point in the future.  Also, a very belated Congrats!! to you and your expanding family!
the mouth should have been a shark head or a clam!!! maybe even put a circular peice coming out of the middle and it could be blowing as bubble of gum
I was surprised that Moriah didn't change the dentures into something else. I was thinking that maybe it could be like a weird-shaped cavern and the teeth would be unpointed stalagmites and stalactites and it could be the home of little creatures in the area between the teeth. and on the top, she could've put grass like it's a short cliff with a cave at the bottom.......or something like that.
You could have made BIGFOOT 😭
Day 292 of saying Moriah should go on Nailed It
The upside down tooth looks like mini totoro
I have an idea, if you have to do what you did to the first squishy again, make him into a potato man.
“Some little feet oh kinda looks like a utter oh that’s gross”
Hi! You sould make a paper squishys ( the ones that's bin trending)
Did you just forget swuishy roasting
hey moriah you should make pickle and pickled pinks kids i have put names and colour shemes on spark my spark name is @georgierules
with the Tooth squishes you can round out the top and make 'Amung Us' characters and or make the little spirits from 'My Neighbor Totaro'
Did anybody else get really excited about the big squishy’s and then she didn’t do the big squishy’s?
You should turn one of the tooth’s into Totoro, it has the same shape. If you don’t know what that is it’s a character from a Japanese movie.
Moriah have you ever looked into ADHD and Autism? I have both and you struggle with some of the same issues I’ve always struggled with!
you can do the mouth  with braces this will be great idea
I like your drawings so much
You should make a tooth a tooth fairy
Chocomel
11:11 kill it
With the denture teeth thing you could smooth out where the teeth are and find a way to turn it into an ice cream sandwich, your videos are great and it blows my mind how creative you are ❤
you should make a tooth cat family. i love all your videos btw <3
she should have put the mouth inside of one of the big squishies
Queen u could’ve put candy or some food type squishy inside the mouth squishy
Hi can you do another unboxing or bakeing video if not that's ok
Just a tip: When you were showing the jaws at 11:05, the shape kind of looked like a taco, so maybe you could go back and snip off a few pieces and repaint it as a taco???
The newest bean body reminded me so much of when i used to play toontown and you can buy a creature pet and train it and they have the same big feet and bean body 😂
You never did your sea shell painting video
Friday was my Bday
Honestly the teeth and gums squishy kinda looked like a drink or food stall with some banners hung from it
My friend John Hipp wants to talk to you he’s upset
I really like your teeth squishy the 1 with the mouth but an idea that I had and you can still maybe do it is paint the inside of the mouth black and make braces but every little brace is 1 of your characters and so there's a different character on every tooth that form braces I don't know it's just an idea, I hope you like it totally fine I understand I love your art so much keep up the good work!!!
Johnny him him jj
The gudetama squishy wouldve made the best potato man squishy!!!!!
I.. im flabbergasted.   THE.. THE AUDACITY..   SHE.. DIDNT PLAY THE SPRINKLE SONG!!
I also thought Bunny when seeing the teeth and the cat was very cute!
U SHOULD GLUE WINGS TO A TOOTH SO IT CAN BE A TOOTH-FAIRY
You should do James and the giant peach
You should have made the teeth into a cake cut down the teeth
Moriah can even make herself more beautiful which is so not surprising tbh as she is the best artist in the world
I'm a YouTuber and I want to know how to edit videos how do you edit urs
Wait I have an idea what you can do with the big squishy. Spend a week(or longer adding to it everyday bit by bit making it have patches of new ideas on it or somthing similar lol
I know you don't like doing this but pls do a prot 2 plsss by the way i love your videos 😊
You should of made the tooth a sweet tooth! It will be rainbow an have sprinkles and,candy.
I literally watch Moriah every day and when I saw this one I was so excited!
1:50 Rude😂
DONT FORGET YOUR ANUAL SEA SHELL PAINTING
Shoulda put eyes on top Of the teeth 😭
You could have cut half the teeth off the dentures and made it into a weird piano. Like the murder piano from Mario
Please oh please. Oh, please make the peach Jerry the cherry with the butt crack.
I love watching moriah! She is so funny!❤
I love watching your videos so much, & I am 6 lol, why do you love squishys?
I love how moriah makes all these jokes when she’s making it
It would be interesting to see a squishy makeover "mad libs" style - like you randomly select from the hopeless bin for each "part" of the squishy (legs, head, ears, tail or wings, etc). I imagine there would be some WILD combinations.
Can you please make a sweet tooth,spicy tooth,sour tooth and spicy tooth please?
She inspires me with art☺️
Turn those teeth into a blob army. I would have made that mouth squishy into a set of grills.
The mouth is just the representation of “Taste the rainbow…”
I have a idea for a vid why don’t you tie dye some BLACK clothes but use bleach my mom has done it before and it looks cool!!!❤️❤️❤️
Moriah, you missed a Golden Opportunity to give one of the giant unicorns a set of dentures.
I think a whole mouth with braces!!
Loved this please do more!
please🙏
I think she could have did gum instead of rainbow grilled chez
Moriah should take the massive peach cut it in half and turn it into like a pot and fill it with mini plants! Maybe it could be a (hope i'm spelling this right) nafaluficus forest
the potato with feet could’ve been mr potato head
She's the squishy tooth fairy
OMG IS THAT MR POTATO 😮
Pls call the tooth cat Carol nila coco=caramel, vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce
Please don't comment bomb this, but this is just a reminder for your annual sea shell painting! No problem if you can't do it this year with mini-me and minier-me. Just a reminder, I hope you and your family are doing well!
She should have made a sweet tooth! ❤ 🦷🪥
Use the peach as face cut aout a lemon slice from face put teeth in put feet on peach lol it would look funny
U couldve done a “sweet tooth” and make all the teeth candy :)
The upside down tooth also looks like a totoro!
who else was raised by her better than their own mothers >>
Day 2 of begging for a cousin Burp plush
MORIAH CAN YOU PLEASE PAIN ON CROCS NEXT
Hmm with a bit of work that mouth squishy could be morphed into a very odd clam like creature.
WHERE WAS THE SPRINKLE SONG
How  do we send squishys to you
she should make that the leader of all bean bodies.
I love ALL Moriah Elizabeth's video, and I have been watching since 2020 . To this day, I love, her videos ❤ also when is spark app going to come out on Android phone ?
Honsetly if you think about it, she could’ve made the teeth into a taco 🤷
MAKE THE CHOCOLATE INTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF NOFALOGEAN CANDIES
Ok... but hear me out... giant squishy x tooth set! Cut open where the mouth on a giant squishy should be, trim down the top and bottom of the teeth and maybe take some of the middle out too, jam the teeth into the face hole of the giant squishy, TA DA! the most cursed squishy EVER! Ooooh I want to go online and find teeth and giant squishy now to try it! Chaos reigns supreme!
Add wings to tooth. Tooth fairy
Anybody realize that 8:53 this cat  was moriahs first trans character with its gender realignment surgery
Am sorry am late been busy with my mom great video like always ❤❤❤❤
My little sister wants you to make lime for lemon to fall in love with and a chocolate for strawberry bunny’s!!!
The dentures could’ve been turned into a character inside a cake thing
I kind of want to see her turn into Rosie the Bashful Dragon for Halloween this year. Anyone else? 😅
Please do the peach  P.s, PEACHES PEACHES PEACHES PEACHES PEACHES I LOVE YOU OOHHH PEACHES PeAcH pEaCh
This remind me that I went to the dentist
I want you to paint directly on the calendar with all your characters on different square!!
Me when I see the customized squishy:  NUGGET ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You can do a remake on the teeth😁! Cut out a cookie 🍪 or cupcake 🧁 and stick it in the mouth making it look like the teeth 🦷 are biting into the food!You could make rainbow 🌈 braces!? It's just a thought. Love your channel!🥰
Maybe you could mix the feet and teeth to make a bunny with big ol feeties
Hello!
when you were talking about using colors outside your comfort zone you showed yourself wearing a sweater with those colors, nice touch
The last squishy could of been a ring box/ jewellery box?! ❤️
Omg ok yall blow this comment up if we should try and convince her to re make THE TODDLEERS AND TIARRAS like it would be soooo cute. PLEASEEEEE MARIAH CONSIDER IT ❤❤❤❤❤
I would weirdly die for Little BigFeets
the whole time in my head on the mouth one, i was screaming TACO!!!! 🥲
name him stompersss
8:32 This also reminds me of the white bunnies from My Neighbor Totoro! Maybe you can make a family? :)
You should make a giant pair of denchers out of teeth
Do morebakeing
I just said is she ok 😂
70s colour scheme
For the teeth you should've added some black lines to make it look like it was chewing rainbow flavor gum!
Hear me out eras tour squishy shirt or just squishy
You could have put the teeth on its back and made it into a taco or a cake
1:55 i know what you can do with the dental squishy you can turn the teeth and the jaws into a cute clam shell and the toungue into the animal living inside the clam shell 🐚 hope this works! 😃
You can make a mouse out of the teeth squishy
i love! your videos!
I wanna see Moriah make lotsi as a squishie 😊
Moriah did a great job on these. I do the the mouth could have been turned into a taco with special filling (like her dessert taco a while back). But still they all turned out cool. Keep up the good work :)
Everybody bombardment by until she turns herself into pickle
mouth could be a dessert taco!
Is it just me or did the denchers look like a cake slice?
Ok but the first one kinda gives potato head
comment bomb the next comment please!!!!!!!!
can you make the donut queens husband the donut king? pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi Moriah! I love your videos ⭐🌸!! Can you please make a "series" decorating all the teeth, and turning them into ice cream cats? Like the 4 stacked cats that you have, sorry I don't remember the names, but you know which ones I'm talking about😣 And also,  If you have more of the big teeth mouth, you could make super simple designs, with the same rainbow blend inside, and outside make different colors? Like purple, blue? Love your videos!!!
Guys I think we can all agree we love love and I mean LOVE Opie as everything plushie,sguishy  and tons more please make comment bomb also # we ❤❤❤ opie
Cut up the teeth make them into blobs!
I dare you to paint all your characters as teeth and make a full mouth.
Where is the sprinkle song!!!!!!!!
The teeth could be turned into animals if you use the sharp parts as legs
the teeth at first looked like a mushroom, you could of made a double mushroom with a face inside
Also, can you name the cat tooth thing Catdy instead of candy lol it’s bad ik 🥲 Comment if you think it’s a good idea      👇
I think it would be really cute if Moriah would make a tooth squishy again, and maybe she could make a little fairy kinda struggling to lift it.
i love little big feets
I feel like you could have made the teeth a clam it would have been cute, you may have had to made it a little more round at the back and add like a pearl in the middle idk
The second, I saw the feet I thought “ maybe she could make feet Beanbody” I guess I was right lol
The giant peach should be a carriage pulled by the three giant unicorns 🦄
I think that you should have made the teeth biting, a strawberry, or a fruit.🦷🍓
What about the sprinkle song😢
bro you could've made the potato a blobb
You could've made the dentures a clam  or oyster coming out if it's shell!
You could have done a chipmunk with a big tooth and for the gums you could have shaped it to kinda a ice cream sandwich but you were still creative in this one (I’m not tryna be rude btw)
You can make the peach the strawberry from Cloudy meatballs
Who else has been watching Moriah for a long time? ❤ 👇
Hey Moraih, do you mind if maybe you make bunny series like you did with the aliens. Please and each bunny is a different fruit and we already have Lemon. Love y9ur vids❤
YOU FORGOT THE SPRINGKEL SONG
I think you could have made the mouth some sort of  sandwich
the mouth would have made a really cute clam!
I was kinda hoping moriah would have done among us using the tooth squishy. But I love the calico cat!
I actually love the lil guy so much. He has such a blank stare and he's adorable and I love him.
Turn the tooth upside down and make a bunny family or cat family like the chicken family
The first one is MR Potato Head
why did it make me think about that potato guy in toy story🥔🦶
When Moriah makes art and she doesn't like it I wish I could go through the camera and say, "Can I just take that awesome art?"
🤢🤢🤮🤮❤‍🩹EWWWWWWW 🦶🦶🤢🤢🤢🤢The feet look like🐛🐛
Moriah Elizabeth, can you make a video with ur memes in it.. like. ALL OF THEM!! 😁
I've been seeing braces being used as an accessory (weird ik) a lot nowadays.... Maybe add cool braces to the set of teeth squishy???
hey Moriah! You're so creative and I love your smart thinking! I also have squishy ideas, one of them are a giant squishy that is a grandma and the pair of teeth are her dentures and they are either coming out of her mouth because she's clumsy or its next to her. This would be the first grandma squishy if you would like to create it! I also have another which is basically a simple look but a animal coming out of the giant peach. I hope you like these requests!
Try make the giant teeth instead flip them upside down and make them family’s of bears!
I thought you could have given the braces with your characters on them.
Bro I want a series of turning teeth squishies  into lil cats :3
I thought it was mr potato man
BIG FAN OF LIL BIG FEETS!!!!
She should have turned the bean guy into Mr potato 😂
you could make a video that u combined all the squishy scraps?
You should’ve turned the dentures into a macaron 👁👄👁
I just started the video.  You could make the teeth into bunnies!
Okay call me crazy but the mouth squishy I thought could be turned into a dessert 👀 like a layered cake thing and the teeth could be puffs of frosting and then you could add frosting puffs on the top 👀
Should have opened the mouth and have it eating something
What happened to Opie?
SPRINKLE SONG?!?!?! 😭😭
I think putting braces on the teeth would've been great!
"squishes and questions ive been avoiding" PLEASE
I honestly think you should try one of those color by numbers paintings 😊
You shouldve painted braces on the gum squishy!❤️
For the last squishy:  Could've made a purse or those sea something that have pearls inside them
Loved this!  Pls do a part 2 where you makeover squishies from the other categories you've been avoiding! :)
Make a giant peach person. You can cut a hole in the peach and add the mouth full of teeth... now that I have v e watched it, you could have turned the mouth on its side and made it into a dessert taco
Make the teeth into little fairies  (tooth fairies) 😁😁
I wish with the teeth you would of done like a blinged out grill. Put rhinestones on it, made the teeth like gold or silver and just went all out. Maybe another time. ❤
I know I’m late but still, and I haven’t watched it all but. And hear me out. Teeth into creepy rabbit things??
I’m sorry that’s a bunny not a cat
best youtuber we love you
For the dentures squishy, you could’ve also been chewing gum🖤
Where is the sprinkle song!!
You could do a rainbow tooth series! 😂❤
I feel like there was a slightly missed opportunity for the Tooth. She could have made it a Tooth Fairy!
Rainbow grillz on the dentures!!!
WE NEED A WHOLE COLLECTION OF PEEP DESSERT CAT TEETH.
Where do u keep the squishies that aren’t on ur shelves or are they all on the shelves
Little big feets is so adorable
Maybe combining a big squishy horse and give them some huge teeth? It’s a stretch but that’s all I can think of 😂
Ok, but the mouth, you could totally turn into a dessert, like a moon pie or something!
You could make the peach in to a blob.
From now on I'm gonna text "hey its you" on every single video that you upload don't ask me why am I doing this but I think it's fun so Heyy it's you
U should have made the mouth a macaron 😂
Love what you did with the tooth. What if you gave a little squishy makeover to the other teeth (even just cleaning them up and repainting them) and donate them to a pediatric dentist's office?
The giant Peach needs to be turned into Jerry the Cherry with his booty crack. 🍑
The set of teeth one I thought looked like one of those Korean dessert with cream and a bun. Could have put it on its side and made it a dessert LOL
When u pulled out the last squishy the first thing I thought was "A CLAM! MORIAH, A CLAM!" lol it was giving Ariel vibes. Luv ur vids btw Moriah <3
The teeth one when it was done kinda looked like a macaron from the from
The 'cat' hopping off screen like....
You forgot the spinkile song
for the teeth you could have done a taco
The only reson why me and my brother watch u is because ur demonic like ur sqishes
BEAN BODY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
little big feets is my favourite thing ever
for the tooth one you could have added arms the same shape as the pointy bits and made it a random thing with arms and legs. xx
gudetmama couldve been a blob!
Am I the only one how wants Moria to do a chocolate family 😅
Can you pls do a relly relly big school sooooo your characters     pls pls pls 🙏❤❤❤❤❤❤ I love your videos 🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄
Imagine if She made a tooth Fairy like a tooth With wings
For the teeth u could’ve done maybe a clam with a pearl or a fancy box with a ring inside
Look at the teeth sideways! They can be a dessert taco!
😃😃😃😃😄😄😄😀😊
You should have made the chattering teeth toy squishy into the teeth statue spencer made on icarly for that dentist. It’s like the same color pink gums but with rainbow teeth that are bejeweled with rhinestones lol
PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO where u do a squishmake UNDER where u try and make an ugly squishie on purpose.   Pls copy so she sees
I miss the old  Moriah she was more of a goofball hehehe
I know it doesn't matter, but I wanted to share... the thing she thought was Gudetama, is actually a potato!  I have a high quality plush that is exactly the same and both products are from Barnes and Noble. (But the main source is from the business, "Soko") So if you want to find multiple designs of that potato, just search, "Soko potato"
You should make a squishy for the planet you made up   Idk how to spell it
moriah do a big squishy
i love lil big feetss he is so good
I had a idea for the mouth squishy:  Cut the inside of the mouth out, fabric glue it together so it isn’t just a hole into the alice and wonderland, paint it so it looks like a cake.   because i thought it was actually a falling cake, just an idea if you get another set of dentures. Hope you like my idea!
You should have gave the denture teeth braces
the first one looks like a zoombini
You should tern out of the teeth in to Toothles from how to train you Dragon😊
I was thinking more of a type of taco or something with the set of teeth, but...I guess that's okay too? 😂
You can make the mouth with the teeth an ice Cream sandwich or a macaroon
To be honest. It's alien. He could have two or even more right feets
I love  🎉your work  and  I  had  been  hear of  the  longes❤❤❤🎉 love  your work  can  you  do  this  for  me  as  a  video  do a computer
I know what she should do with the Toots she should make a bag the tooth fairy and toots be in the bag
I thought you were gonna go the “sweet tooth” route 😂
you REALLY missed the mark to make them sweet teeth.. a sweet tooth...? eh. you know what I mean.
The set of teeth is "awful taste but great execution"  There isn't much you could have done without more squishy surgey. Like putting a food squishy inside the mouth. And it still would have been awful 😭
Love the new bean body of course! Littlebigfeets def needs to come back again, he's amazing. Your sweet little kitty is also awesome, but as soon as you turned that tooth upside down I saw a baby Totoro!! 💖
I think it’s a nafalogian  squirrel
Can we all agree we need an animated version of moriah's ocs
Please do this again tho not forcing u just I absolutely loved this video
moriah never gets boring to watch because she always makes so many different things with so many different jokes while also protecting her childrens privacy
I love the cat 🐈
U should turn some of the teeth into a teeth family.
The upside donw tooth looks like the little creature following Totoro in the movie. You could also paint it like Totoro :)
8:44 kitty maew
Do a squishy I’m boxing
YOU DIDNT ADD A TAIL TO THE TOOTH CAT!!!
Day 1 of asking Moriah to customise her own potato heads set
I love little big feet 😂
IDEA! For the teeth, make a sweet tooth, salt tooth, sour tooth and spicy tooth set! XD
IDEA! For the teeth, make a sweet tooth, salt tooth, sour tooth and spicy tooth set! XD
the feet could've probably been turned into little squids or jellyfish, and the mouth probably could've been reshaped into an ice cream cookie sandwich  im also really glad we had the same idea for turning the tooth into a bunny/cat! adding a little bunny tail that sticks out could help with the weird shape  overall, great job!! cant wait to see what you do next
TEETH INTO BUNNIES OR TOROTO! just pointing out like upside down
you could totally call the bunny 'drizzle' its the cutest name!!
You should totally do a set of animals made from teeth, the cat is super cute!
Who wants denitslava and Moriah Elizabeth to Collab they would be a perfect duo

I JUST L O V E SUPER SLIME SIMULATORRR!!!
Hey girl this you biggest fan i have a really good idea 💡 soooo basically when I see or hear posca your name just pops up in my head so I thought if you made a video of reviewing all the types of posca pensss i know that reviewing is not your thing but as I know you like to do some fun and new things sooo i really hope you will give it a SHOT   By snithika 🇮🇳🇮🇳
Little Big Feets actually turned out cute<3
At this point, she just needs to make a whole new human out of scratch with all of those teeth in feet
The teeth could be bunny blobs upside down 😂
if you chopped off the bottom of the teeth it could have been a cute mushroom person or an oreo
Am I the only one who looked at that denture squishy and thought that it would be  "fun" to join it with that giant peach? I probably was the only one
Maybe the set of teeth could be some kind of alien tooth- clam thing. If you cut into the rainbow thing and put in a pearl or a blob-alien creature?
I LOVE YOUR VIDS
If you ever get a mouth again I was thinking you could turn it in too a clam or like attach it to one of the very big squishes anyways just a suggestion
I am waiting for a Laurenzside and me collab THIS PLS BE THE NEXT COMMENT BOMB
8:35 me: "ITS TOTORO!"
little big feets is definitely my new favorite character
Can you please,please,PLEASE make a therian mask in one of your vids🥺
Nooooo no Sprinkle song 😭
Am I the only one that thought she was going to make the tooth an among us crew mate
you can re create a vadapav from the set of teeth squishy
Part 2
Hi Moriah! I hope you see this and if u do I LOVEE U! I’ve been here since 2020 :3 also for the mouth I thought why don’t you add little cats or dogs and yes this is SOO weird but little critters may make it cuter!
The eyes are giving coco from animal crossing 😚🫶🏻
We NEED more tooth cats!!
I feel like some type of food squishy could’ve been clued into this set of teeth. I definitely love to do little cat.😅
I love all of them 🤗❤
I know your thing is cuties but if you wanted horror you could have the teeth biting a chunk out of one of the chocolate bar people :)
Just wanted to add a fun idea for the denture set, you could turn it on its side and make some sort of taco shaped something, taco cake?
LIL BIG FEETS IS NOW THE BEST CHARACTER
when the tooth was flipped over it reminded me of Totoro and his little forest friends (mini-totoros!) I'm not too sure if you'd be able to to ghibli characters though. It was such a good idea flipping the tooth upside down!
I want moriah to make a giant humanoid teeth feet face demon thing
i feel like cutting all the limbs off the chocolate bars and using a pastel color scheme on them would be nice and basic  its boring but like its the only way to fix em    edit! also if u maybe round the edges of the teeth it could be a macaron just paint the teeth pink or smth
I’d love to see Moriah take a skeleton or another scary figure and make it cute.
You could do a rainbow on one of the teeth squishies
Am I the only one who thought that the cat squishy reminded them of the little totoro after it was painted with the basecoad?
the upside-down teeth look like totoros
the set of teeth kinda look like a bridge
I really love that you turned the tooth into a cat. Although I think a yellow bunny peep would’ve been cute too. Or my idea was to attach wings to the back and make them “tooth fairies”
Cute I love all of them ❤
Moriah makes me smile every single day
Moriah… what happened to the sprinkle song?????? 9:05
i would die for little big feets
I got spark but it’s saying opine can’t let me in😢😭
Moriah… what happened to the sprinkle song??????
You can add wings to the teeth and they are the tooth fairy ❤
You can turn the peach into a pumpkin/jack-o-latern for Halloween
add rainbow braces to the mouth+teeth squishy
Do all of your teeth squishes!
i can’t wait to see what you do with the big unicorns!!🤩🦄
I'll big feets😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
How old is your child?
MAKE A CHILD AND FATHER/MOTHER TO GO WITH THE CAT
I feel like the dentures or mouth or can like be a purse if you put it at a angle and like the teeth of it can be like fluff of the purse? Idk if that make sense but I feel like it would work and look better 😭
Maybe with the chocolate bars you can paint your own type of chocolate bars as a video!
Omg moriah thank you so much for using my denture squishie❤❤❤                                                           Jk       Wasnt     Mine    Sorry to the person who did own it

I actually really like the teeth!
I love watching your videos. They always give me a laugh and inspiration. Idea for any possible future denture squishies.  Turning them into dessert tacos, cake things or regular tacos. The teeth could be candies or pieces of tomato. Thank you for your videos and the laughter you bring.
You should take a foot and dedicate each one to each of your kids like how the small foot represents like baby’s and stuff
How hasn't she made the teeth squishies into a sweet tooth set?!?
The upside down tooth looks like the little white forest spirit from my neighbor Totoro
you could've made a tooth fairy
You could’ve made the teeth into a dessert taco!!!!! Missed opportunity ;((
You have a child Give the squishes to the child
You could have put a little character inside the mouth or dentures and it could be scared like it was geting eating copy this
moriah, since you are the queen or sprinkles it would be fun if you did a video making actual edible sprinkles. You could make some inspired by your characters, imagine,  Moriah's "pickle mix"  in the colors and possibly even fun shapes.
The dentures. Blinged out grills!
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The New World Order is about to come into power and the world is about to go into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

As soon as you turned that tooth upside down I saw a TOTORO-shaped friend!!
Day 291 of saying Moriah should go on Nailed It
Lil Big Feets is my favorite person 🥺
As someone who has a foot phobia, I surprisingly love lil big feets 😭😂
I think you could have did 2 birds 1 stone if you gave the teeth the feet and turned it into one of those silly wind up chattering teeth toys
Hear me out here sweet tooth
The potato is tayto 🩷🩷🩷🩷 which I literally obsess over
The denture one you could’ve made a Oreo cookie
I love the little cat!!! 😍
You could've made bite marks out of the dentures and reshaped it into a bitten donut! Or added foam handles to make it a purse!
You should totally make a squishy from the unfixable squishy bin based off of Luna in sailor moon crystal! It would like so cute having a big crescent moon on one of your designs
I think a good way to get rid of the teeth is to make like tooth characters similar to what you've done with the blobs? Ooooooor you can make a spin on tooth 🧚‍♀️ being actual teeth! I think both of those could turn out very cute
MORIAH, IF YOU FLIP THE TEETH UPSIDE DOWN YOU CAN MAKE LITTLE TOTOROS.
Weird idea but what if you do a weird large amalgamation of all of the squishes you dont like and turn them into a creepy blob creature thingy since halloween is coming up. It would be a nice lil switch up from all the rainbows and stuff and a new twist on the usual squishy content!
❤️🎉WEEK 10 of asking Moriah to customize 🎨🖌️ a Polaroid camera 📸 I love you content Moriah 🎉❤
lil big feets tho
Mr Feets a bean body confirmed!?! Did Galacticat steal him from Nopholophogus!?! Is little big feets mr feets father!?! He must be so concerned!!!
For the big mouth you could glue the mouth together and make a cake with a candle on top or u can make it a music box
She forgot the sprinkle song I’m scared for her
Finally someone who doesn’t think rainbows 🌈 aren’t g@y
You should make a candy cane themed squishy
you could have made the mouth a taco
You can do a tooth fairy hahaha
I like your bean body aliens. Just saying...
Me: is that Mr potato head Moe: it’s some type of alien Ands some things on Me:WTH
I made a drawing of a flower from your planet
You should totally customize a Key Board with all of your characters! Repost this so Moriah will see it! (Credit to: @ellaandsamscooltv9772)
Day 7 of asking you to make a dollhouse and each room is designed for a different character Repost if u think this is a good idea
Day 2 of asking you should make the star cone bean body food as a real food in a baking video!!!!! Let’s make this a comment bomb
EVERYONE THIS IS A NEW COMMENT BOMB COPY AND PASTE THIS PLEASE THANK YOU: MORIAH DO A CUSTOM DOLLHOUSE FOR YOUR KIDS. NOW. PLEASE. THANK YOU. BYE.
I think she should have done a “sweet tooth” for the tooth squishy
11:00 be the rainbow taste the rainbow
don't worry moriagh we all love watching suffer!!! (jk your vids are gret though love you so much *lysm* <3
I'm a dental hygienist and I actually love the teeth squishy 😅
We can’t let moriah forget about the seashell painting video😄
I love what you did with the mouth its super cute! my first thought when you were thinking of ideas was that you were gonna turn it into a dessert taco😂
Moriah you are the only person on YouTube who I Have watching since Technoblade died
I want plum bear makover from squishy makeovers 26
That's not Gudetama, that's Tayto Potato!
Love your videos ❤
YOU FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SOMG
Call him small foot😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nice Work ❤
I want Moriah to make a littlest pet shop custom.
Day 4 of asking for a fantasy map
I'm gonna ask my grandma to buy me all the stuffies on your store
But I love her vids
Uh hu?.......definitely not making me uncomfortable bees
Hear me out; make a part 2 of this but instead of making several separate squishies, you make one squishy using multiple ones you've been avoiding
MORIAH SHOULD MAKE AN UNO DECK OF CARDS  Copy/paste to spam!!!
You should make a giant shark by using the peach as the body, the individual teeth as fins/ the tail, and the full set of teeth for the mouth
Love the calico cat desert squishy
My shiny teeth and me ✨
Moriah you put sprinkles on the squishy but you didn't play the sprinkle song what happened?
You could have turned the denchers into an ice cream sandwich with like a cookie on the top and the bottom 😂❤
For the teeth do a reenactment of chip skylark in shiney teeth and me. The chocolate people-let’s all go to the lobby movie opening scene
Oh make a Fle---😏lol I won't say it
There’s a reason why I’ve been avoiding them, they’re ugly they’re difficult I don’t like them and many many more ——-Me when I have to go out be in public—-
The peach need to be transformed into Nafalafagus planet 😵🤪
Here’s an idea- use all of the giant unicorns and make them into different kinds of desserts(Oreo, birthday cake, mint, ect). That way you have a whole group of them to display.
Omg this was so funny! Pls do another vid like this it was rlly fun to see and made me laugh 🤣 love u Moriah!! 💖
u could have made the last one into a cookie just cut the inside
You could've made those denchers a taco 🌮😢
So i got this random idea but could you make a movie about your chrators?
I love "Big Feets" SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much :))

little big feets is my new favorite
MAKE THE BEENBODIES AS SQUISHES PLEASEEE
I love your squishy makeovers! What grade sandpaper do you use?
I thought you would have made the dentures into a cake or something. Oh well.
Someone has already probably suggested it already but I’m not sure so… I wonder if the full set of teeth could be sat up and made into an open change-purse that zips?  Might be cute to decorate the sides or even put a little creature inside 🌈
MORIAH MAKE A CALENDAR WITH EVERY MONTH AS ONE OF HER CHARACTERS!!!
Little Big Feets is so freaking PRECIOUS
Can you do the screen printing kit
U could turn the teeth into cats like the 🦷_ (bottom bits) are the ears then u can smooth out the other side into more of a face
Cute😂❤🎉🎉
she needs to do her seashell painting video
You should do the giant unicorns
DO A HAIRLESS CAT SQUISHIE
You should make a character inside of the mouth one!
Moriah I absolutely hate the first one😂
Turn the big peach into a little woodland House for little feets! ❤
Anyone else want more of this? 😅
Shoulda have the denters some grills
I have a suggestion, what if u used the feet as like fish gills like the toes and put it on a mermaid squishy or sm or you could use them for scraps  Just a thought that poped up love your vids x ❤
I love your videos can you make a squishy with a royalty crown on
MORIAH YOU SHOULD MAKE A WISDOM TOOTH SQUISHY. I WANT TO SEE YOU MAKE A TOOTH LOOK SMART
Hey Moriah! I had an idea for the teeth... what if you created  some sort of "tooth fairy" characters with different colors, styles, or emotions etc. I dont know if that made sense or not but that was my idea for  what to do with the teeth.
Can you please do another ices cream bowl with the peach
OMG! You are so funny and the best.  can you make a video were you color things in different styles?
Turn the teeth upside down and make it a cat squishy, make a tail make a fox squishy, cut the tooth dents and make it arms make a ghost squishy. (Ideas) edit: OMG I JUST WATCHED IT FULLY SHE DID THE CAT ❤
Oh nvm you did that😂
Nice vid! Haven't been here for a while tbh Moriah seems off and  different since she announced her baby but she is still good I guess
... Moriah you forgot the sprinkles song
Y'all remember four years ago when she moved out of the basement, i remember it like it was a year ago or something lol.
Hi if you turn the tooth upside down it looks like a blob bunny
I personally call your youngest daughter : mini, mini, mini, mini, mini, mini, mini, mini, mini, mini, mini, mini, mini, mini mini mini mini MINI me
The alien bean body is so cute! It's huge feets are hilarious 😂❤👣   🎶LiTtLe BiG fEeTsSsSs🎶
What happened to opie the cat😮
U can paint braces on the dentures😊
Make the giant peach into the planet of the bean bodies
What are you got it done with the set of teeth is cut off the teeth or try to make it into a macaroon
I think the teeth would be a cute set.  Each one a sweet tooth, a different candy for each tooth.
its crazy to think my first EVER moriah elizabeth video was her 4TH SQUISHY MAKEOVER!! time flies like crazy ❤️
Ok I am so excited for you and your kid but when do we get to meat her and I think that we should call her micro me
Little feet’s is my favorite character since a LONG time ngl.
Moriah use some of your UGLY squishies to make a massive squish monsterrr
just got the BEST idea for the big peach squishy turn them into shadow berries!!!!!! The next comment bonb???
I unabashedly love the Little Big Foots. He reminds me of Bangalee.
OMG she forgot the sprinkle song.......AGAIN
I know this is really weird but when I was younger I used to paint stuff with nail polishes it would be so funny and it would make my day if you made a video about you painting stuff with nail polish
You should dedicate a full video to doing on of the massive ones like i dont know a unicorn inside a peach
My first idea for the tooth was a SWEET tooth!! I dont know dont ask
? Ok so no more sprinkle song?
I wanna see more of the teeth-imals😂 and a friend/ twin for little big feets❤
the mouth squishy kind of looks like a seashells
Hey when would spark be on Android we've been waiting for so long just an estimate is okay
When she said " Do i hate this squishy? Well hate is a strong word, so yes, i hate this squishy." It got me cracking up so much that i was coughing my heart and lungs out, lol.   Edit:The coughing my heart and lungs part was a total joke but i was coughing
The teeth you could make into a range of tooth fairies, "borrow some wings" 😍
Those toes look like a future pie crust to me 👀
I absolutely LOOOVE Lil Big Feetss!!!!!!!
for the teeth you should make them in to little ... ... ... ... ............................ people ?......... alien's yeah and make them live on a weird lookin planet
You could add cute little braces to the set of teeth!! Maybe heart shaped or shaped like some kind of charms. It could be cute!!
Maybe make a ‘sweet tooth’ collection, paint them all rainbow but covered in sweets/candies ☺️
I actually really like the cat, the funny shape makes me love it even more
Make a part 2 call it something like "what have you made me do"
Maybe you could make a tooth fairy castle with the rest of the teeth
U should do a video where u can only use scraps to make something
Please please please please do another art things to do when your bored
You could do a cute pumpkin with the giant peach since Halloween is coming up
I love it can you do a second one
Make the cheese into a taco
IDEA FOR ONE OF THE BIG THE TEETH! Yall remember the rainbow toothpaste she painted? Maybe moriah can do a tooth after it used the rainbow toothpaste. If you think this is a good idea copy and spam on videos!
Moriah I really want to be like you so my birthday is coming so I asked to get squishy‘s for my birthday to be like you also you should make a stitch squishy. My favorite thing in the world is stitch squishy’s in Halloween stuff.❤
Very interesting video. Great to see different ideas for the more unique squishes. Thank you for sharing. If your reading this I hope you have a great day and know. “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬ ‭NIV
I love you videos and I thing that you should make a Halloween cat😊🌙🐈‍⬛
great job! Here's a thought, denchers into ornately iced slice of cake?
teeth squishys are the only squishys  dentest give out
LOVE YOUR VIDEOS ❤❤❤😜😜😜
Plz give me your fred squishy I love him also do you have roblox?
When you paint on smooth surfaces what type of sandpaper do you use?
Also guys pls say this too. Moriah pls can you paint a lamp plssssss❤❤❤❤
I have spark🎉❤
Moriah is the only one that I watch so when I go in my YouTube shorts all you can see is moriah 😂❤
Omg it would be so cute if the teeth were totoro bunnies
I'm sorry but the new bean body is PERFECT I adore him so much and I'm not just saying that ♡♡♡♡
When you did the middle of the mouth it looks Luke they are chewing rainbow gum
Dislike for no sprinkles song
The tooth upside down looked like the little white version of totoro in the movie my neighbour totoro
For teeth can't you do them upside down as little blobby bunnies?
The small tooth with sunglasses on kind of reminded me of an apple. :) Perhaps you could make something with that?  Awesome video by the way and I really love the cat!
you could've made a rainbow coming out of the denture squishy. throw up rainbow?
And I’m still obsessed
I have been watching her since 2021
i loooved the way you made the tooth a cat!! i know you didn’t like the mouth but you could’ve turned it into a taco lol
The teeth could have been an ice cream sandwich  either way they all looked good 😊
You should paint troll dolls and I luv your vids
What if with the chocolate bars you did a treats from nophelophagus (can’t remember how to spell🤣)
Turn yourself into a pickle please😢
Moriah it's my birthday day
I love how Moriah never says subscribe to my Chanel every single vid. I have been watching her for like 4 years and I haven't heard her say it once unlike other YouTubers who say it every single vid.
Soon as I saw the dentures one I thought if a music/jewelry box maybe just me though
Make little Bigfoot one of your regular characters😊
Hey Moriah! I love your content. I also thought maybe those teeth squishies could be also be used as a body with legs whenever you have a random head that needs a body?   I’m always impressed with your creativity! Thanks for everything you do!
Me seeing the tooth: “MAKE IT A RABBIT!” Her: “It’s a bunny!” Me: “YESSS” Her: “…cat…” 😭😭😭😭
u could of made that one potato from toy story 😂😂
Can you paint on press on nails
okay hear me out- PATTERNED TEETH.
NOOO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE YOUR A MONSTER POOR GUTEMA
😂Big fetsss😂😂😂😂😂
I love your alien bean bodies when you said take notes I actually took those notes and I have drawn every single alien bean body you have made ❤ 👽🛸
Why am I kinda in love with the alien been body 👁👄👁
I love little big feetS
MORIAH I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS FOR A FEW YEARS NOW CAN YOU GIVE ME A SHOUTOUT IN YOUR NEXT VIDEO?
That is not a cat, ears to big, it should be a rabbit
I have a question how's ur cat
Mariah why did you not make a tooth into a among us character
2 things, so first, she had the perfect amount of feet for a rainbow of feet, and also, I have that potato squishy that she put the feet on.
I love yourrr videos
DO THE FLIP FLOP
for the "dentures" you could have done a clam just a idea :))
YOU FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG!!!!!!!!!!
For the teeth squishy‘s you should make a dessert cat family
Why didn't you do the sprinkle song on the tooth cat thing 😢
Me, watching and hoping Moriah makes the tooth squishies into blobs. 👁👄👁
You should do a video of minier me picking what you paint once she gets a bit older. 😁🩷👧🏻🍼🎉
When I saw the chocolate people I instantly thought she could cut off the limbs and turn them into regular chocolate bars. No faces lol I think foods with faces are weird
I have an idea for one of the teeth. The first thing that came to mind was a tooth fairy. Luv ur vids ❤
MORIAH FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG!!
I mean you know that orange wedge trick where you stick the orange in your mouth and you keep the rind on and smile  and it looks like your mouth is orange. That’s what it kinda looks like just rainbow with the mouth squishy
I was hoping Moriah would add wings to the tooth and make it into a "tooth fairy"
You could’ve cut the middle part out and put something inside of it
Pls do velvet ones that will be cool
We want the pig with wings😢❤
PETTION TO NAME THE CAT CAREMELLOW BECAUSE CAREMEL + MARSHMELLOW
Cute ugly
hi Miss Moriah i have an idea for the teeth and the peach you should make the peach the mouth and cut it half way and put the teeth inside and make them have a party inside the mouth of the peach :]]]]]]]]]]]                                                                                                  Love your vids stay blessed
If you ever wanted to do a set of teeth again, you could turn it into an oyster with a pearl inside, or the cave of wonders from Aladdin.
Huge question ⁉️ can we use blobs for our characters, cuz I have a really good idea for a blob I just wanted your approval first. Luv your vids thnx for being an inspiration.❤
Moriah can you do the Nofalofigas flag?  (Sorry if I spelt it wrong)+
Please make a new character. (Not an alien bean body pls) like someone related to pickle and please bring him back to.❤❤❤❤
peeps are bunnies lol not cats
I mean different characters on different squares/days on the calender
I LOVE the cat!!!! Soooooooo cuteeee 😮
Moriah should paint a keyboard and every key should be a character. Repost a like so Moriah can see❤
Please make a calendar with each chapter on it.
I think you did great with what you were given! If you did this kind of thing again you could totally use the teeth to make a tooth fairy! (I got a tattoo of one this year and its in the realm of creepy cute lol)
The tooth upside down looks like a blob
I made a tiny dragon puppet that is inspired by Moriah elizebeth she is one of my biggest inspiration
Moriah: It remindes me of where they pull apart a grilled cheese sandwich  Me: It looks like a giant marsh mellows  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Actually I think the different color scheme on the first one is great, it's nice to get away from rainbow sometimes haha
mr pototo
Am I the only one who was thinking Moriah would turn the dentures into some kind of cake?  Also absolutely love the tooth cat. ❤
How could u do that to gudetama he's my favorite 😭
Please, Please, PLEASE make the massive plum into angry lemon!!🍋
The dentures looked like an eclair to me
For the teeth squishy u could have painted rainbow braces on it!
Moriah didn’t do the SUMMER SEASHELLS! 😭
what if moriah made the set of teeth into some sort of dessert but what she did was way better
It's a 70's theme bean body
I have a idea for a tooth what if you made a literal sweet tooth
She should turn one of the teeth into an amount us character! 🦷🦷🦷
Moriah! if you see this u could have made the nameless gum tooth squishy a toaster (you can see it if you flip it on the flat side).
“ do I hate this squishy? Hate is a strong word….SO YES” I’m dying💀😭😭
IM IN LOVE WITH LITTLE BIG FEET
Hi Moriah!  a very big congrats to you, hope you're doing well.  I got a great video idea.  Its a bit crazy, but you could try and customize a violin or a musical instrument. totally understand if you don't!  Thanks!
How ab a makeup video, like do art on your face w makeup products? 🤍
I love the tooth cat.
Moriah you are great!! I'm very sad because Spark is not avilable for android😭
Hi you are my favourite YouTuber ever
u should of painted his toenails!
Moriah don’t forget to paint on pumpkins this year!!
When are we gonna see that big green blob squishy get a makeover? <3
I love your vids!!
😂 Hi
2d not cute
Moriah is it good to paint on squishys with markers or paint pens bc i dont have fabric paint and i really whant to paint on squishys
Oh I hate how you make you been body’s 😂😂😂😝😝
U should make a new I'm chrkw
I saw the tooth as a little Totoro
pls paint another blob character
You should make a squishe by hand
Im like how little bigfeets came out! We didn't get the sprinkle song😢
Mariah, I have a squishy free to make over. So but I need your address. So they know where to send it.
Every couple days I always check to make sure if moriah  has posted any new vids
I love your videos, they are the best.
My name is macey
What a fantabulous 🦷 tooth
You could have made the tooth a fairy 🧚‍♀️
It won't let me on spark Moria help me 😢
i would have made horror squishes out of the weird ones lol
She should put her caricatures on each one of the teeth😊
ANNUAL SEASHELL VIDEO
You are one of the only things I look forward to every Friday
Omg congrats on ur baby!!🎉🎉❤
Pretty please paint dominos pls
woulda been so fun if u done a rainbow cavity on the top dripping down the tooth just an idea hehe
I think you could've turned the dentures/teeth one into a TACO! But your "taste the rainbow" version is cool too🤣🤣
OooOoh fot the teeth set you could have made it like a face in a costume head with a monster that has teeth like the shark onesie and then the rainbow teeth would be a face or a blob in ittttt
Sprinkle song!?!?!?
11:05 you should bedazzle the teeth
You should plant your self as pickles no cheating
I have a great idea for the extra teeth you have make like a tooth fairy add wings to the teeth and maybe some other stuff! ❤
You should make character dog toys! I would love to see my dog play with fred! Or pickle!
I love little big feets
YOU DIDN'T PLAY THE..... SPRINKLE SOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG👿😥
You should do pop sockets...
MORIAH!!! If you do teeth like the mouth next time you should do like a grim but like cute with like rainbow diamonds, or make the mouth look like you are a blue Slurpee or something!❤❤
She could have turned the mouth into a little cake with the teeth the frosting
Mr potato head
Hiya
THE MASSIVE UNICORNS WERE NEGLECTED ONCE MORE NOOOO
Day two of asking you to do more panda bun videos
OMG!!! THE UPSIDEDOWN TOOTH LOOKS LIKE THE LITTLE TOTORO!!
Please please make a doll house for your kids or keep it in you art room but make each room for a different character! So like for example, for pickle, he would have a all green room with pictures or his face all over things. And for Georgie same this as pickle but it’s yellow and Georgie you can also include the couples in the same room and if you made some twin squishes you could add them in a room together too!   COPY AND PASTE THIS SO SHE CAN SEE IN HER NEXT VIDEO!!!
Can you PLEASE make a whole set of Cali-dessert-cats !?
With the peach maybe you can make i big version of a nafalogian berry
WHERE'S THE SPRINKLE SONG 👺👺👺
MORIAH GET MORE TEETH AND MAKE THEM A NEW CHARACTER LINE THINGY CUZ THE BUNNY EAR THINGS ARE LEGS THEN YOU TAKE OTHER BODY PART LEGS AND MAKE EM  Edit: buy another mouth squishy and put it in the peach!!!!
It could be cute to use the teeth to make the tooth fairy!! Like a little fairy holding a tooth or something!
hes a angre lemin
U have to do the big unicorns
She does  not have a  mafe
I really think you could of made the set of teeth into like a clam maybe
🧡🧡🧡please like so she can see this idea 🧡🧡🧡  Butttt I think the peach you could turn into a cute pumpkin or skeleton head for Halloween, and if you want to take it a step further somehow incorporate the teeth into it for extra spooks😅 🎃 💀
Can you do another thrift store makeover please
When you turned the tooth it looked like Totoro
WHERE WAS THE SPRINKLE SONG
if anyone's wondering, i think that potato is from smoko? it's not gudetama
Moriah you forgot about painting your seashells
Can you make a yearbook using all your characters??
❤
Who else wants to see her do the massive squishies?
The cat is so cute!!!!!!! I wanna draw it
You might be able to make the peach into the planet nofalofagus
You should make a series of painting squishiest with designs people recommend in the comment section
Moriah is- Funny  Creative  Cheerful Wonderful Smart Moriah is the reason I started painting! She has taught me so much! Thank you Moriah!
You should turn the giant peach into a fruit from nofopofagis
I’ll never get sick of the alien bean body’s, they are so cute and the more you make the happier I get..
ouuuuu the cat one , I LOVEEEE ITTTTT
colour combo aint dat good but the appearance was impressive ✨
Moriah please do a video out of all of your memes!!??
You could have made the dentures one of those Japanese cakes with fruit inside and made the teeth frosting:’]
What happened to Opie?????
Mariah do a video on all of the massive squishys
The peach should be done as a planet… aka nauffalofugas(apologies for my spelling) with like the characters floating around on it!
The upside down teeth look exactly like totoro
Ok can anyone else see that the upside down tooth looks like the tiny white totoro?
10:27 you can make a family with the teeth! Do it please 🙏
i thought she would make the mouth into a cookie sandwich by cutting out the middle part
Omg I love little big feet
I’d have made the teeth a face inside of like a dinosaur onesie 😂
ok but why do I have an idea for the rest of the teeth squishies: she could turn them into like little people if that makes sense? Like it already has two legs and she could add arms and a face...idk lol just an idea.
I actually love Little Big Feetsss so much! And the calico kitty is so cute! The dentures are still hideous…
That one with big feet is "BAbY AllEn BiG fOOt"😂
you should make a saniro set of squishes
The cat squishy was amazing!! I would absolutely love to see it as a plushie 😊
I love the my man ain't gonna be a foot model 😂 (and yes I like my own comment)
idea for the teeth: flatten the top part or make it rounder. Turn it upside down so that the tooth roots point up and make bunny faces out of them  edit: nvm i continued with the video and you actually had the same idea xD
Moriah can u pls do a potato squishy makeover pls pls pls and make it a little friend and that there best buds🥔
Yeeeees a squishy makover😊🎉🥳🥳🥳🥳
Idk why but my first thought when I saw the dentures was cut the teeth so they were flat and make it a taco!
How did you know I had my hand up?
no sprinkle song 😢😢
Hey Mariah I have a idea for your shop you can maybe make odies around Christmas with your character on them because I know i would definitely buy them
The set of teeth Squishy looks like a macaroon to me
the cars got ignored again.
My favorite is the cat 🐈😺
why dont you make a tooth family and choclate fanily😅
This is always good. I stumbled across these makeovers and can’t get enough. I started watching and kinda was a little disappointed not seeing the gums getting combined with one of the BIG squishies… but I love the tooth cat.
i would’ve made the teeth something like a clam shell with a little creature inside peeking out!
What if yout cut the middle out of the mouth..fuse it.. and stuff it inside of the peach where its mouth should have dentures. Add the tip of a random tooth for a nose... add some feet like the first one.. and boom..giant weird head creature thing. Like this comment if you think this abomination is needed.
A famous nickname that I've had for ages is perfect for the first one... BIGMANLITTLETOES
If you pute the thif upsiddone you kan peint it to loke like a cat
Has she had the baby? I'm so confused XD the last time I watched her she was 8 months pregnant
Mouth is puking rainbow
Okay but Moriah hear me out- you can fix the teeth! Just turn them into a taco or a macaron!! You can actually pair it with one of the jumbos as a snack!!
Moriah this is kinda random but october is coming and its time for you to turn yourself in one of your characters i would love to see you like willfred (idk if its right)
I love your video
i love your vid's
Hi Moriah! I have 2 ideas for your teeth Squishies so if possible, you can try them out in future videos! 1. Toothtopia: You can make any kind of creatures with those teeth Squishies and then bring them all in together like a citizens of a country.  2. Big mouth: you can maybe make different colors and designs of teeth and then make a gum shaped squishy (I don't know how sorry) and them put them all in like a huge mouth.  I know these are very risky and time consuming ideas, but in case you need something to do with all those teeth, here is the ideas 💗✨
I’m obsessed wit the bean body
am i the only one who loves little big feets hes so cuteee
Where did the sprinkle song go
Imagine one day seeing her customizing dominos Board game
Please bring your spark creative play app to different countries I can’t download it 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I’m taking it personally that the sprinkle song wasn’t played
Moriah the chocolates with the faces are called shopkins
Moriah where was the sprinkle song when you applied sprinkles to the tooth kitty? (disgraceful)
Part 2!❤
for the teeth u cldve put a creature inside and made it into some kind of macaroon or something 😭
It's crazy to think I haven't skipped a video for 4 years, ireember, when  pickle was born ♡
SHE DIDNT BUT THE SPRINKLE SONGGGGGGGG
I think the individual teeth could be cute if they were turned into a “sweet tooth” set! With sprinkles and icing and candy themed colors! I think I actually do like the denture set but I was fully prepared for a bubble gum ball to be added between the teeth!
You should paint your play buttons PLS I AM YOUR BIGGEST FAN I HAVE BEEN WATCHING YOU FOR 6 YEARS
ADD FEET TO THE MOUTH
Idk why but i think the teeth is a rainbow macaroon
I just thought you could make it into a sandwich then you said grilled cheese but in a mouth and I was like 👁️👄👁️
I FREAKING LOVEE LITTLE BIG FEETS😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Hey Moriah! Can you please add Indian currency to your merch so I can also buy down of your merch! Please...
the cat was cute but you could've made a tooth fairy that was a tooth itself 😭
8:47 is that mokke? (tbhk)
I’m pretty sure that the chocolate people are from a show called Shopkins
Dear Moriah when is your app spark gonna be available in India
I had an idea for the mouth squishy- you could have smoothed out the teeth and turned it into a Pearl?
I feel like the dentures squishy could have been like a dessert sandwich in some wrapping and the teeth could have been frosting you know. Just me?
I love the alien bean bodies
Hi please make teeth family
Day 290 of saying Moriah should go on Nailed It
lets get Moriah to 10 million!!!
8:38 ITS A BUNNY in my opinion
PLS COSTUMIZE A POTATO SQUISHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔
Just me or does Big Small Feets look like something from the Weirdmaggedon Finale?
Legit thought she was going to put those dentures in one of those big dudes' mouths.
I can never get enough of moriah ☺️
Moriah is sooo talented!!!😊
Omg its ben like years sense ive seen ur vids
Is it just me who thought that giant potato squishy was going to turn into a big version of that tiny mango squishy from years ago?
She's the definition of facing with fear. I'm inspired to face my long-lasted enemy, i.e homework
EVERYONE THE ART QUEEN HAS POSTED
Lil' BiiG fEEts is the cutest thing I've ever seen.
i loved everything but next time i want her 2 paint only giant ones
Costomize a domino set
Could you make a Video were you fix the donor Squischies
Is it wasn’t for the feet
I am 4:55 minutes into the video and im hoping Bigfoot makes an appearance PLEASE he would be so quirky.
You could turn your theeth quishy into AMONG US. Please do it would be SO GOOD🔥🔥🔥
So idea for your teeth problem! Where i live there are random horse statues everywhere and they are painted with random art (abstract, landscape,ect,ect.) So could you do that with the teeth and then just donate? Them to all the dentist offices in your area? I know my town has over five dental offices at least...if you have any toothbrush squishes you could do matching sets? I don't think it would encourage kids to actually brush their teeth but maybe the dental offices could enter their little patients into a raffle for said teeth if they have no cavities?
My sister and I did a thing with some feet squishies we got a few years ago. We used your videos as inspo to make a cute baby momento for my niece. We painted some feet quishies in cute colors and stamped my niece's footprint on the bottom of the squishy with baby safe ink then sealed it. It makes cute and easy nursery decor. ❤
Honestly I’m kinda glad you didn’t do what I was initially expecting you to by adding the feet to the mouth squishy to make it into that toy that I’m pretty sure the mouth is modeled after. The one that winds up and walks around opening and closing. It would’ve made perfect sense but it probably would’ve been pretty boring.
Hi Moriah I love your aggressive videos soooo much ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You could make a "Merry go round" ride with the mouth 😅
Tbh the teeth thing at the end could be a seashell😂 and I love the tooth caramel calico chocolate cat too
You should totally make the jam packed art into a puzzle on your shop , it would be so cool :D  Original commenter : ellie.dibs22
Maybe the teeth could’ve become a macaron 😮 if they could be smoothed out? 😂
The tooth upside down looks like the little guys who collect acorns in my neighbor totoro
*Makes sprinkles without sprinkle song* Me: "....RIOT!"
Moriah litarally roasted the crap out of the squishies💀
I love the alien bean body
You could’ve done an ice cream taco with the teeth lol by flipping it on its side 😂
She should make a teeth family😂
Tooth squishy cat series?! How cute would that be?
I think you did not embrace the horror enough. What if you used the denture squishy and had it eating one of the chocolate bar people.
moriah you could’ve turned a mouth into a little Desert
Where is the unicorn bear donut😢😢😢😢
When I saw the teeth set denture thing, I instantly thought of turning it into a little clam guy
Make a rainbow of bunnies made from teeth!!!!
WHERE WAS THE SPRINKLE SONG??!!
Change the Teeth! I would suggest Cut out the center and sculpt a scene with characters on inside
Hi
Oh my u should do a bunch of tooth cats there so cute
The upsidedown tooth looked exactly like the totoro-rabbit sidekick; I'm glad you made it an animal too. Maybe a tooth right side up would work as special bean body with abnormally tall legs lol The peach! Animal insert (like the dragonfruit dalmation) or nafalogian (srry spelling) fruit, maybe its the abnormally large one that won a harvest festival competition thing? My thought for the feet was a... squishy version of that thing people do with getting footprints of their babies so they can have a memory of how small they were with name and birthdate written on and stuff... Baby feet covered in paint sounds cute.... Maybe you can brainstorm something with that? Or just keep giving little friends giant feets 😊
What would you do with teeth and feet it showed us but how did you figure that out
We definitely need a Tooth Kitty Family! A Whole Dental Litter!😂😂😂
You should’ve turned the mouth into a macaron
I love gudutoda Probably didn't spell it right
Aw I totally thought the giant green snot monster squishy was going to be on here. Used that guy in a few thumbnails for sure 🤣 I'd love to see him get a male over!
Honestly adore how the cat one came out.   Funny enough I was trying to figure out if there was a way to make the gums and teeth look any different than what it was since you turned the tooth into a cat.  And I realized that when you painted it all white it kind of made me think of like a clamshell with a creature maybe hiding inside of it. It probably would still be difficult to forget the ghost of the dentures haunting the squishy no matter what. But just a change of view for it is interesting.
Well I have some bad news Moriah has ruined the newest book in the collection of  "Create This Book"...  The most recent spine is upside down from the other two... time to burn my house down and run away to canada... sigh
Wait- half of the time of a video… if you know you know… she said a while ago when she announced her pregnancy that if she starts making 10-11 minute videos she is MOST LIKELY in the hospital???!! Moriahhhhh?🙈🙈🙈🙈😅😅😅😅
You should make Georgie a girlfriend
❤❤❤❤❤❤️😘👋🏼🥹👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼👋🏼❤️
I was thinking that the tooth squishies upside down looked like a little guys from my neighbour totoro
Hi Moriah I love your videos you inspire me to do art and I love your character Georgie he's so cute I hope one day I could get one of your plushies keep being amazing and keep being you bye Moriah❤
with the teeth you couldve done a dessert taco!!
Add some BIG eyes to the top of the mouth of teeth...think frog eyes. I think that would add some cuteness to it❤
8:35 SHE COULD HAVE MADE TOTORO🤧🤧🤧
Can you add rainbow braces to the teeth
You’re the best !
You missed a gold tooth opportunity 😢
MORIAH YOU MISSED THE CHANCE OR PAINTING THE TOE NAILS IN RAINBOW AND ADDING CUTE BRACES TO THE TEETH 🙀🙀
I literally created the tooth squishy a very long time ago on my YouTube channel. Would have been nice to get some credit
Could have made the mouth one into a weird taco 😅
My idea for the dentures was make it a dessert taco, the teeth could've been whippe d cream oozing out, the gums could've been the shell, and that weird space in between could've been dessert taco stuff.
MORIAH👹 you need to do painting yourself as one of your characters🙃😴🙌🏽✨😃
You can probably make a cheeseburger out of those sets of teeth 1:37
mack pickiels a hole family from cat dog grandma grand pa and dather and a son and a wife and drerp gets the same
The tooth she could have made a toco😭
You could have made a dessert taco with the teeth, and for the tooth with pointy roots you could make it into a cute devil for Halloween.
to be honest little big feetss is now my favorite, besides pickle
The blush on that cat squishy is so good though (she gotta do a whole family of those now!)
The teeth one reminded me of those chatter teeth toys
Hi Moriah can you do nofelogyh what ever so can you make a squishy that is from that weird planet
Put the TEETH in the PEACH!  With a unicorn horn.  That could get interesting.
make this blow uppppppppppp
The little tooth looked exactly like an apple. Just so you know if you ever need an apple in the future, you have one.
Name the big foot one flappers and everything u draw it make it so its "walking" with big little stomps if that makes sense?
Moriah: if you turn the tooth over it becomes something else Me: a bunny! ...or a cat Moriah: a bunny! or a cat
PLEASE PLEASE USE THE PEACH PREETYPLS  IM ON MY MOM'S ACCONT PLS
little big feets is adorable!!!!!!!!
I LOVE LITTLE BIG FEETS
Could've cut the mouth into cake layers with frosting
I accidentally paused it right when she was holding up teeth, saying teeth, and showing all of her teeth 😆😬
What if you do a whole yearbook containing all of your characters???
When I first saw the teeth, mouth, situation I thought it would eat a gumball. Mouth surgery the middle out and pop a gumball in. Now looking at your finished project, it could have been a waterfall scene. With rainbow water of course!
I need to own a little bit feet’s
Could've made a foot flower lol. Just attach the feet into a flower shape
girl I need to get back into ur vids I always love them sm when I watch <33
You should do giving squishes that I’ve allready painted a makeovre
I have another idea for the mouth!! maybe later on when you redo your most worst squishes you can do a design for each teeth? I know it will be a lot of work but me and your fans will appreciate the video and your work so much!
You could’ve turned the teeth into a mimic from dnd :)
A tooth fairy would be so cute if this becomes a series 🥰
She’s made a lot of squishes but Little Big Feets is one of my favorites.
THE UPSIDE DOWN TOOTH LOOKS LIKE TOTAROOO
You should decorate the teeth squishys and give them to a kids dentist office
Wait...just wait... Did you really not put the SPRINKLE SONG?!!!! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY YOU DENY ME?!!!! 🤪
oh. oh great. that "set of teeth" squishy brought back the trauma i had from the vid you unboxed it in LMAOOO that was so long ago now, wow ALSO THAT CALICO CAT IS SO SO CUTE OMG <333
bedazzle the teeth
With the teeth squishy’s you can a make one a sweet tooth with a bunch of different sweets:)
the shape of the alien bean body reminds me of mr potato head from toy story.
I was thinking the mouth squishy looked like a backpack, the teeth part being a zipper, and you could have cut into it and had a character popping out. It ended up much better than before though❤ Thank you for the video. 🌈
Moriah I looked up about your cat and I'm sorry for your loss 😞
One of the tooths could be a carrot roots 🥕
the tooth skwishie that was remake overd can be chubs gf
Who else is day late and is crying and screaming.
ok hear me out. IF you get another gummy mouth squishy, modify the teeth and turn it in to an ice cream sandwich or something similar
Why haven't you done Daddy Derp?¿?
Moriah is what I look forward to every Friday, her humor, her funny attitude, and her wonderful art! ❤ luv u girl! 🥰
A really cute name for the cat wiuld be Chocomella the cat <3333
I always play spark while watching Moriah's new vids!
Denture squishey idea : make it a taco 🌮
sweet tooh.....?
Put the feet on the chocolate
I like feet like what do you mean 😢
Make the dentures like a cupcake or a sandwich or something like an ice cream sandwich
when is spark coming to andriod plz
I thought she'd put the feet on the long parts of a tooth and make them legs
Moriah, pls pls plssss, do another bake with me it's been tooo longggg 😫🙏🙏
I see a baby bum 😊❤🎉
Moriah: look at the cute cat- proceeds to make it hop.
<33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333
I was hoping she'd attach the teeth to a giant squishy
I LOVE LITTLE BIG FEETS if u ever made him a plushie i would buy him immediately
You know what would be cool in October those pumpkin and Dracula and Frankenstein squishy you try to do your own Twist on them just an idea for this season.
Can you please make a candy corn monster or a candy cane Dino’s sour and make it part of the Dino family   I have been a fan for so long
I love Moriah and I get so many great art ideas from her. LOVE YOU MORIAH!!!!!❤🧡💛💚💙💜
Little Bigfeets is unreasonably adorable considering literally everything - I genuinely think if it weren’t for Tom (my beloved <3) he would be my favourite bean body
WOW best bday ever when moriah post❤❤❤❤
Personally I think it would be cute if she painted the teeth like a “sweet tooth”
Am I the only one who thought the bean body would be a mister potato head? No, just me? Cool cool 😂
it would’ve been SO CUTE if moriah turned the teeth into that push the tooth biting crocodile game
Honestly for the teeth I thought you’d do really colorful braces. But I still kinda think it’s funny. Maybe if you come back to it you can add metallic paint and rainbow bands
So I was on custom cursor and I found a Moriah Elizabeth cursor. Moriah I think you should definitely have this as your cursor on your computer.
Do any of you know how to put a picture on spark/jpeg
Moriah, could you please make and paint some tide dye clothes for mini me and your newborn? 😄(Love your content :)
Anyone else like ; Do the dentures, Do the dentures! DO THE DENTURES😡🤬 no hate
I totally thought you were going to use the giant teeth on one of the giant unicorn squishies to make it have a huge, creepy, toothy smile. Imo, you should do that anyway, so the unicorn has eaten the rainbow cheese toastie.
Also you haven’t answered my calab question I am Kkm Wolfy
I am just saying that to prove her inosince
O i am so tired os her making her stupid bean body’s
I LOVE YOUR VIDS!!!!!💖💓❤💗💝💘🥰😍😘
U could give the teeth feet to make one of those walking-chattering-teeth-things
you could have made the teeth into a seashell
You should make the peach into Jerry the Cherry!
i love little big feet
Why does the first squish mellow? She talks about look like a Mr. potato head?
Congratulations on getting 27 on trending Moriah 😂❤🧡💛💚💙💜
You could have made the teeth into a clam!!
you could use the teeth to make characters like "turnip boy" i feel like that would be super cute! but i love how the redesigns turned out! <3
Multi tooth squishie multi tooth tooth chair chair!! Babes nooo it's a tooth w a cat on it please I think Itd be so cool to thrift a lil cheap chair and turn it into a crown thrown 😂😂😂 teeth are difficult anyways I feel like youd have to cut all the roots and sand all the decos to use the foam 😩😩 please show me a crazy tooth chair art god❤😂 get Jackie to helppp
Bro why is the big feets squishy so cute….
Should have made the first one into mr. Potato head! That's what I thought you were doing.
MAKE SMALL BIG FEETSS PART OF THE MASCOTS LIKE THIS COMMENT IF YOU AGREE
Hey Moriah, have you ever made a cutom zine?
I love big feets hes so cute
Maybe make the giant peach into a giant sized nuafiloffigoin berry
seashell video???????
I just had to get a tooth removed because my dentist got a drill stuck in it when they were trying to do a root canal.....so yeah this gave me flashbacks 😂😂
I remember you talking about making night bears in the video were you made the drawing of the sky bears! I would love to see the night bears sometime soon!
You should make this into a series! Maybe one day you will face the horrifying peach 🍑
MAKE A TOTORO FROM A TOOTH OMMMG
I feel like you missed an opportunity to create a series of ‘tooth fairies’ based on desserts (the irony of desserts being bad for teeth but they come and collect all the teeth that fall out)… would be cute 😊
I loved this, she should definitely do a part 2
So we have mini me and now miniature mini me
me personally i am in love with little big feets he’s so cute 😭😭
PETITION TO HAVE MORIAH MAKE A CALENDER WITH EVERY MONTH AS ONE OF HER CHARACTERS
a mr. potato head would’ve been PERFECT for the first one!!
I actually put up my hand and then she said “put your hand down !” 🤣
U should take the set of teeth n bling ( bedazzled) it out !!!
idk if you’ve used the baby bottle squishies yet but if you haven’t you should 100% paint them and put them in micro mes room
You could use the chocolate bars and make them personalized for Pickle, Derp, or other character. Like their own brand of chocolate. If you get what i'm trying to explain (which I suck at; explaining)   I think that could be cool to try:))
You could use the feet to maybe add to other squishy and make Christmas Gnome or Rainbow Gnomes 😂
Omg lil big feets is my favorite bean body😭😭💙❤️🧡💛🤎🥔
Am I the only one who wants to see Little Big Feetssss in plush form???? Talk about adorable.
no sprinkle song! *cries in the corner*
loved this one, i would have made that rainbow grilled cheese inyo a peice of cake haha
You should paint some of your biggest squishys for a video!
Covered in fUzZy 6:09
The first squishy reminds me of the Mr Potato head
I wanted her to do the chocolates and the big one's 😭
You still haven’t done your annual summer seashell video for this year!! But you are doing a great job at making me laugh every Friday and I always look forward to your videos
Even on creepy squishyies she can make them look cute😍
Do a video with the big boys
If you get another denture squishy you could turn it into a Japanese folded cheesecake pancake. The gums into the pancake, the teeth into cream cheese filling, and stuff the middle with small fruit squishes. Maybe, even add sprinkles and some kind of sauce topping?  Anyways, I loved the video and I hope you are having an awesome time!
Please make one of the teeth into a TOOTH-Fairy a lil wand and some wings.. rosy cheeks?? Could be so cute
It’s a cat named sweet-tooth
:D
if you want moriah you could turn the mouth squishie into a clam opening slightly, i think the mouth kind of looks similar to that,and i think it could be cute
the set of teeth- i woulda turned it into a clam... it sorta looks like a deformed clam thing... like.. color the outside a color- then do a black inside for the the shadow and then drew a mini circle and give it a face-. buuut thats jus my idea XD
I love that you are so creative Moriah!!! But don’t feel like you have to do human body parts anymore🤣
Hopefully this inspires you to be a little more excited about working with them at some point in the future.
The blue on the feet is kicking me in the head right now😢
I have the biggest challenge EVER make a dinosaur         PURPLE
make a massive corn cob out of the teeth! or turn them upside down and make potted plants squishies
A tooth could be turned into a blob. The roots could be legs, all it would need is some kind of hat/topping to cover the indentation on the head, and maybe some little arms.
The teeth kinda looked like a taco
your videos are amazing
Giant teeth on either a unicorn or the peach! 😂
I actually like the dentures
I once had a nightmare about a giant tooth. It danced with a cane and it sang "You have to floss, you have to floss!" I woke up in absolute horror and my mum told me to get up and get dressed for school. No sympathy for what I'd been through, just go to blooming school. 😂 Love your content Moriah.
second channel called Me Too?
She should make all the teeth into a cat family
Did anyone else think that the tooth upside down totally looked like the creatures from my neighbor Totoro?
It would be cute if for the feet u did rainbow toenails
instead of little big feet what about blibby feet?
8:38 OMG ITS A WHITE TOTORO!!!!!!! look it up they are so cute you have to make another tooth of a white Totoro! they are so easy to make :)
You should puffy paint some tooth gems on the tooth one
CAN U PLS DO THIS AGAIN IT IS COOL
lil big feets
I love moriah so much you inspire me so much I love your art also congratulations on baby number two. ❤🎉💗
u should've added braces!!!!
The teeth squishies would be adorable to decorate for/with your kiddos when they start losing their teeth when they're older.
I DMed you YEARS ago asking you to turn that set of teeth squishy into Spencer’s tooth sculpture that he made for the dentist office in iCarly
The tooth calico cat shape reminds me of the tree spirits from my neighbour totorro
it looks like a singing monster
Heheheheh big feets
You could've made the mouth into a sandwich wrap because the teeth look like lettuce or the edge of bread and the flat part at the back could be the wrap part!
You should do a cat 🐈‍⬛ 🐈 moriah!! I would love it so much (plz do shoutout Bailey fan I’ve been watching you for years!!😅😊)
who else wants to see Moriah tackle the giant squishes?
The upside down tooth look likes totoro from my neighbor totoro
You should have made the teeth as the crocodile game when you press it down and you bites you
moriah but the theets in a giant squishy
You should make a colering book not like the 'create this book's but actually printed out pages of your characters pls
Ok but who’s favorite is actually the teeth
you should've made the teeth into a sweet tooth and then the rainbow can be like rainbow chewing gum. maybe you can come back to the singular teeth.
Could have made the mouth into a sandwich maybe?
i love your videos I am on my dads computer me and my big sister watch your videos every day I wish I could be as good as you
Is it just me or are her intros soooo long.
Congrats on being 27th on trending! But to be honest, you should have been 1st!
YOU DIDN'T DO THE SPRINKLE SONG DURING THE TOOTH COW CAT!
To make your calico cat not stick out as a tooth squishy along you could start making the rest of your tooth squishies into dessert themed cats and make a whole group of them that are different kinds of cats. Great video and I hope you do well with your new kid.
🦷🎂HALLOWEEN CAKE WITH TEETH🎂 🦷
If you get another teeth gum squishy you should cut some of the middle out and put like a donut in it with cavities on the teeth.!
I definitely thought that the teeth would be turned into a 🍔 or maybe a 🌮
You should put the mouth into the giant peach so it has teeth. Lol
You could do the dentures into an icecream taco or a scallop (if you get another one)
i watched seven minutes of this video upside down and didn't question a single thing. also you should do another tooth into a fox 🫶
U should make the mouth squishy into a taco/"cake or maybe end a burger! I think that could add a creative twist!
9:40 Moriah is going to hate me but it looks like a bunny to me 😂
Im in love with Little Big Feets
I think you did great on all 3. 😊👍🏻
whys i think shed do the lime lips with the dentures lmaoo
you should of made the alein bean body mr. potato man
I would have made the teeth into a taco.
I love moriahs videos
I love Little Big Feets!
Lately I've been watching her videos at 2×  speed and oh my makes it so much more funny
for all the individual teeth u should do you characters the bigger the tooth the more popular it is (just a sugestion)
I think this is an easier video idea but ranking ALL of your squishy makeovers, from derps’ cheeseburger, to the ice cream bowl, to the panda buns, and even the the green donut and the cotton candy cream puff. I don’t know if this would be easier or harder for you, but it’s an idea 🙃
Make the peach into a butt that is pooping a rainbow
Little big feet 😍😍😍😍
My first thought for the mouth was putting a gumball in there
I have been watching your video since I was 10. I am 16 now lol and they still make me laugh. thank you
An idea for the teeth is a crown tooth a 👑 of 🦷 :)
i srsly thought that teeth was was a macaron
Are fears are spiders and the dark but hers bad squishy‘s
How else thinks Moriah should try to draw with the hand that she doesn’t write with?
It would be cool if Moriah made a movie:)
SHE ALWAYS AVOIDS EVERYTHING
With the rest of the tooth squishies, you could make a whole rainbow family of bunnies, and make more dessert ones with the extras! You could call it the "Sweet Tooth" line lol
The treaty looked like it could be made into a taco type desert with cream in the middle and fruit as the teeth idk
am i the only one who got unironically mad when she didnt play the sprinkle song😭
Do you ever throw away the squishes you dont like?? Love ur vids 😁✨❤
She forgot the SPRINKLE SONG ON THE TOOTH CAT! Like so she can see this!
I was watching this video while my sister was on her phone and she turned around and said: "wHaT ARe yOuu watChiNG?"
I think his name should be     mr. feet’s
MORIAH HIS NAME IS TOOTSIE, IT HAS TO BE TOOTSIE
Omg Little Big Feeetss can be friends with MR FEETS THE METEOR! That the Galaxy Cat Squishy is holding!
I kinda wanted her to add wings to the tooth to make a tooth fairy but the cat was creative
Mariah you should have made the dentures have braces along with the rainbow inside! Each brace bead thing could have been a different character of yours! I think that will be cute! Blow this up if you want so she sees this!
I named my cello after Eustace
The mouth looked like it could've been made into a little cave with creatures inside (where you painted the rainbow)!!
❤❤❤❤you Moriah
No sprinkle song for the cat 😡
I LOVE BIG FEETS 🙏
Baby reveal!!!!
Could make the big peach into a pumpkin and combine it with teeth, for a Halloween monster look.
Am I the only one that reeeeeally wants Moriah to paint her velvet squishies? 😀
1:37 you ARE the tooth fairy
You forgot the sprinkle song!
For the set of teeth you could've turned it into a dessert. Like an ice cream sandwich and where the teeth connect cut it to look like there was a bite taken out of it
I wanna SCREAM the sprinkles song ?!?!?!?!?!
NO SPIRNKLE SONG
I feel like the dentures should belong to like a OLD revamp of a character
My favorite is the cat but my least favorite is kind of the chompers but I kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of like those in the middle. Is it alien been body middle alien Beachbody little big sweet little big feet
Taste the rainbow
I had an idea for the massive peach, you could cut out a chunk of it and give it a mouth ( like the one you just painted since you said you don't like it that much) it would look so cursed but i think it could work in your style !
I love the squishy make overs!! I know she’s busy with the new baby Congratulations 🎊 Im hoping she remembered Halloween 🎃 is coming and is doing some squishy make overs for Halloween 👻
You should turn a tooth squishy into a tooth fairy and add wings to the sides and make it a pastel rainbow tooth fairy! Please do this idea it would make my day!!♥ love your vids!
I totally would’ve cut a hole into the oversized peach squishy and inserted the gum and teeth squishy into it to give the peach a crazy mouth lololol.
i would have turned the last teeth into a fancy aquarium
who else thinks that Moriah Elizabeth should of made the dentures a very fat taco
I feel like the teeth could of been a dessert/savoury food like a taco or a cake with filling and the rest could of been wings? If she changed the angle of them the teeth yeah a cat or bunny
No sprinkle song? I feel so disappointed. 😆
LITTLE BIG FEETSSS
The upside down tooth squishy kinda looks like Totoro. If you have three different sizes maybe you could do the three different Totoros?  Ps- they all looked really good. You should be proud of what you achieved given what you had to work with.
You could’ve put like a little animals inside of the house, yes, it would be a little creepy 😏 but that’s fun, right?
Can you make a video where you make a squishy or more with your anti style like idk if someone can help me find the word ( because I’m Frensh )but it’s like the reverse of your style
I would've turned the tooth squishy upside down to look like a bunny, and turned the set of teeth into some sort of cream filled dessert(Ps, I'll edit this comment once I finish the video in case she does one of those ideas here lol)
this is helarious
I really love your videos and jokes! 😂
Moriah is the only person I’ve watched religiously sense I was 6
So if you take the weird teeth set and make it into a taco and stick some eyes in there it would not be that bad
Where's oppie? We don't see him anymore
please make more little animals out of the teeth that cat is soooo cute!
Turn one of the teeth into a tooth fairy with wings
Love this so much!! Please make it a series and do a giant squishy (when you can only do one for the whole video!!)  I would love to see you do the Kuchi Kopi from Bob's Burgers that you got. The giant bright green one, it could be another bean body 😱❤
I think I would have made a sandwich out of the denature teeth squishy, the gum is the bread the teeth the lettuce and the inside mouth part you painted rainbow, the meat.
The tooth upside down actually look like those "bunnies" from My Neighbor Totoro
MORIAH FORGOT HER SEASHELL VIDEO GUYS
i know its not YOUR favorite color scheme but little big feets is probably my favorite color palette youve used!! they go really well together and its perfectly suited for his cute odd little guy vibe 😊😊
she need to make one big squishy that combines ALLLLLLLLL the alien bean bodies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
There is so much you could of done with the mouth squishy you could of added braces and drew candies in the mouth!
OMG you should totally use those little people squishy's and make one of your animal squishy couples into people like Shelly and Eustace or Pb and jelly
Moriah i LOVE your videos and your my dads favorite YouTuber that i watch and you gave my inspiration to do art and to TRY squishy makeovers❤❤❤
with the mouth squishy i think another good idea would be turning it into a clam. But its still hard to make a mouth look cute or creative.
MORIAH, THE  SEASHELL VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(ps, love you’re vids.😂
I love your videos!!! The mouth is horrendous but you made it a little less horrendous lol
If you don't like Moriah's bean body's then i need you to leave this channel and never come back!
Please make lil big feetss merch 🙏🙏🙏🙏
You can make a candy apple with the tooth maybe
She’s amazing ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Tooth 🦷 kitty 🐈‍⬛ is adorable!
I'm so surprised you didn't combine the set of teeth with feet and make one of those wind-up hopping toys
Omg! You should TOTALLY make the alienbeanbodys in to squishies!
Moriah when are you going to show us your new baby
you so missed the opportunity to make a mr potato head squishy with the first one 😞
THE ANNUAL SEA SHELL PAINTING VIDEO!!!  I completely forgot about it until just now. We must remind her
When I looked at the tooth I thought you were going to make a blob. You probably could have made a blob to just an idea.
Big feets is seriously one of my favourite characters made by Moriah. Its so weird and i love that🐿️
I LOVE THIS GIRL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😍😘💘💝💖💗💓💞💕💟❣❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💘
how dare she use sprinkles withut the sprinkelsong!?
I've said it a thousand times and I'll say it again...     II LLOOVVEE SSQQUUIISSHHYY MMAAKKEEOOVVEERRSS 🩷🧡❤️💛💚🩵💙💜🤎🖤🩶🤍
You could have made a fat, wonky taco out of the dentures if you turn it up on its end.
she could’ve probably made the mouth with teeth into a desert of some sort
moriah *turns the tooth upside down* my brain: "IT´S TOTORO.... It´s the lil white totoro creature... oh my god"
I would've made the tooth fairy with the tooth but you also could've done the nafalogian tooth fairy but the cat also looks nice
Maybe its just my fantasy but i thought of a seashell when you showed the mouth. Like an oyster or such thing. That would've been cool to see, cause i know you would rock this challenge 😊
I’m so glad to see another video this week!
YOU DIDN’T DO THE SPRINKLES SONG 🥺
MAKE THE PEACH A PUMPKINNNN
Honestly, I fully expected her to glue the feet on the large teeth and make one of those weird walking denture things.
I think ‘lil big feets is very cute
Pant it's nales
the cat tooth thing looks like a worker bunny like the rainbow bunnies lemon lime billy tilly and other but prove me rong
I thought of possibly making the teeth into an ice cream sandwich or something. That could have been cool
Love the creativity in this video Moriah! It’d be awesome to see you do this again if you feel up to it. 😁❤
You should do a sweet tooth collection like someone said!
Plz make this a series
3:14 omg no it’s not gudetama, it’s the smoko potato 😭 poor guy
You could make the tooth a tooth fairy
I love the colors on the first one
the giant peach would make for a great pumpkin with fall coming up!
Why is my videos silent
The tooth one she could have made it like a totoro! Granted she would have had to  round out the bottom a bit.
The set of teeth could be turned into a geode cake slice.
Can u do the chocolate family next pls
POV: she likes the set of teeth! :0
for the mouth one she could have stuffed little dessert squishies in between the teeth where the rainbow is
Omg she forgot the sprinkle song!!!😢
I love little big feets
Little big feet fan club👇❤❤❤
10:50 you should have painted it gray/brown like rocks on the gum and teeth, then cut the inside and put a mermaid inside
She forgot the sprinkle song 😢
Idea! The peach 🍑  could be, a 3D of that sprinkle planet i can't spell with the claw aliens on it 🫶
for the teeth one you should have glued on little paws coming out of the mouth and did like a little face so it was like some sort of animals peeking out of the mouth. i feel like that would have been so cute
She could have made a handed house with the teeth
MAKE LITTLE BIG FEET A PLUSHY
tommorow is my birthday and i am getting all three create this book. I cant wait
Sprinkles on gums and diamantés on teeth could help 🥰
loved it so much i was waiting for the tooth from a very long time , you could have turned the set of teeth into some type of cake with the teeth as whipping cream
I honestly can't tell if I love or hate all the feet.
*I was thinking you could turn the dentures into a clam shell!* I also thought the separate tooth squishies one could be turned into an apple, but the cat-bunny worked out even better :)
Moriah is the only person that can’t make a video without a rainbow in it
I love how Moriah doesn’t force her kids into her channels like most parents do- She protects their privacy and doesn’t stick a camera in their faces ❤❤
10:08 Something that im not sure others agree with, if you would have cut out the inside and glue the top and bottom pieces together, you could of made it a layered cake :O
When moriah said she was out already I thought she meant like 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
NOOO FOR THE MOUTH THINK U SHOULD’VE DONE LIKE WEBS INSIDE THE MOUTH AND A LITTLE BLOOD ON THE TEETH AND MAKE IT VAMPIRE TETYH FOR HALLOWEEN
LIttle Big Feets is ADORABLE
You know with Halloween coming up you could turn the peach into a jack o lantern
Does anyone know if she filmed this video when she was pregnant or after she had the baby?
one of my fav youtubers! [i have literally 2]
Sweet tooth’s! Make each one a dessert.
She could have made it into a clam
I'm still waiting for squishy Bill! I'm sure the idea is dreadful to you, but I know you can make him super cute!
U should off turned the teeth into amongus
I thought you were going to say the last one was “tasting the rainbow”😭
The full teeth squishie would’ve been cool if Moriah cut it in half and had the teeth eating something like a noffaloffagus fruit or something ☺️
No sprinkle song?????? 💔💔
#1 was bad, #2 was adorable,  and #3 was ok...
THE FEET😭😭
the tooth cat is very “max and ruby” core lol
It’s September can you do another qna
Sorry if it’s dramatic but I would die for little bit feets
Why Gouda tama!!!!
moriah please don’t stop bean body aliens like im obsessed
Noooo summer is over And no seashell painting video?
What I think I would've done with the teeth squishy is, cut out a chunk of the middle part and glued the mouth shut and try to make it inte a sandwich in some way
For the teeth, if you ever want to retry since you don't like it, it looks like it could be made into a dessert. Maybe a creme puff? It might take some cutting but it might work :)
ok I see how your obssesion is because first you were obssesed with sprinkles and pompomss, then blobs, now alien bean bodys
I have been watching for years!! I love your videos!!! ❤❤❤
The tooth rabbits look like the little creatures in My Neighbour Totoro.
Im too lazy to watch the merch or sponsors but I do sometimes
Thank you for a fun video. Moriah=)Have a great day=)
Pregnant Moriah be giving out vibes 😂
I would have used the full set of teeth eating one of the candy bar people.
I thought she would make Grimace 😂
Adding rainbow braces would have been nice in the full set of teeth one
With the teeth one, i think the gums could have been green like grass, and the teeth as rocks or something while the inner parts being a cave or a cute scene with animals!! or with blobs exploring!! anything really!!
I feel like moriah can just throw anything together and call it an alien bean body 😂😂
Could’ve done squishy dentures into desert taco or even rainbow teeth dentures like in cartoons when they do the slurppe and it’s rainbow mouth
Am I the only one to find crazy potential watching this ?  Tooth upwright looks like a sort of bean humanoid with only legs, like thoses memes with poses but no arms. rabbit and cat are such a good ideas too!  With the full set of teeth you could stuck two of the feet and maybe some round googly eyes and make a sort of funny monster. Event giving him arms and a desert to munch on, or the rainbow chees sandwich itself  I feel like there is such an oportunity, with a mismatch of random parts, to creat an army of cute little monsters ! Maybe by combining some in the hopless bin. I'm sure you can still put together really cute little beings in your style, even with such wonky base! Embracing the weird, like the japanese yokais A random flower pot jumping on it's lonely foot, so it can chase the rain and grow a flower Maybe something with a foot expression? Cold feet something with an ice cream ? Maybe a two sided character, with one foot each, that complete each other, one with a smile, the other with a frown, and representing start off on the wrong / right foot (we can even imagine the wrong one being painted with your least favorit colors XD) I'm getting stupider ideas by the minute. Instead of "having one foot in the grave" why not "having one foot in the gravy" There is a saying in french, "avoir bon pied bon oeil" "to have good feet, good eye" wich mean "to be well", I imagine a cute eyeball all sparkly jumping on it's foot. So stupide.  With the teeth you can also find something with a tooth fairy, or, as for us french, a "little mouse" (exactly the same concept than the tooth fairy but instead of being a fairy, it's a mouse) character.  I hope you will revisite the concept soon!
They all look awesome, but the dentures turned out WAY better than they started. BTW...you always put a cherry on top of your dessert creations, so why don't you turn the giant peach into a cherry character all its own?
👏 WE 👏 NEED 👏 A 👏  PART 👏 TWO 👏
The teeth would make perfect boddies for the blobs it would be cute
I just started the video, hope she makes bigfoot with the feet!!!!  Update: It wasnt bigfoot  Update to the update: Its bigfoot but not
I wish she tackled the jumbo squishys
Roses are red violets are blue moriah will pin me too * if she doesn’t idccccccccc :)
You could make a sweet tooth
Abandon the dental model outside of your local dentist
Before she painted the alien bean body it looked like a Mr potatoes toy that u add body parts on 😅
I've been watching Moriah for so long and she makes me so happy,my birthday is next Saturday ❤
I love the beanbodies and the whole idea. It's literally so cute and unique!!
You really thought we'd miss you completely avoided the car squishys so no one will force you to make a car squishy, did you?
I could see you being able to make a pearl like opened shell out of that open teeth squishy if you ever wanna make over your squishy make over. No shade, just an idea. Love your content. Thank you for sharing ❤
THROW YOUR LEAST FAVOURITE ACROSS THE ROOM (if you want to)
Congratulations on your new precious blessing. I watch her over and over I really enjoy her. The set of dentures I pictured a taco of some sort. I know you made a desert one. Maybe a redo later.💖
I would have been to but you can do something else and we will love it
7:29 she looks like a morphy to me,lets name her morphy 9:47 he looks like a gerald,we shall name him gerald lol this isnt a command...im just saying...
Moriah u should just quit nobody likes you
Sprinkle song?
Turn the peach into a jack-o-lantern for halloween!
YOU COULD HAVE TURNED THE TOOTH INTO A BLOB
Make a BIG human squishy with the feet and teeth... MWAHAHAGAHGA
the teeth could also be a fleet of Totoro! Another cute video, little big foots is adorable!
Today’s spark was create a new energy drink, so I’m i made one of an energy drink on Nahafalogin😂
Make a costum beach ball with characterters on it (copy and past to make happen)
If you don’t make that giant peach into Jerry cherry, that will be the biggest missed opportunity😂🍑🍒
what about the sprinkle song
You should have made the set of teeth into a taco
THE SPRINKLE SONG
If you have more mouths and feet you could try to use them to make those wind-up toys that chattered or walked... not sure if that would be something of interest but it would be interesting to see
MORIAH SHOULD MAKE A BOARD GAME WITH ALL HER CHARACTERS INCLUDED ON IT
I have no idea what you were trying to do on the last one 😍
You didn’t play the sprinkle song😔
When you flipped the Tooth squishy over all I could see was the little Totoros
U should have made a tooth fairy like add wings for a different squishy! But I love what u did!
I think turning the dentures into a character hiding in like a costume of some sort would’ve been kinda cute 🤭
Next video make a sandwich for the rainbow mouth!!
A tooth fairy squishy would be cool. 🧚‍♀️
The shape of the tooth squishy kind of reminds me of totoro from Studio Ghibli!
I loved these makeovers.  👄 🌈 The mouth is simple, but represents your channel. Add a 🌈’Me’ squishy keychain or necklace hanging out of the mouth.  🦷 🌻 Make a large sunflower with all the different size teeth, gluing them together in layers to be the petals.
YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE MR POTATO HEAD FROM TOY STORY
She could put the teeth squishy in a fix it video and turn it into someone wearing a Dino costume
What you could do is attach the feet to the bottom of the teeth, so it looks like more defined legs
The upside down tooth reminds me of Totoro! I never even knew Tato Potato had a squishy either.
I think with the teeth you could’ve made a dessert with a cat or a bunny or a dog inside and the teeth are the frosting maybe in the next vid you could fix it
❤❤❤❤
6:22 where did that one come from?
*i thought da RED BRIGHT teeth could be a burger-* but ilyvsm! And I love da makeovers!❀❁𑁍
If you get or have a raccoon squishy you should make it pb and j themed idk why I just thought it would look cute
my favorite beanbody so far!!!!!!
The cat tooth was so cute! It’s so creative. Btw please do a pumpkin painting video in October!! I love your videos😊
My daughter loves her!  So I decided to watch ME and I love her know to❤️
I was hoping you would turn the final teeth squishy into a clam with a pearl in it!
Totally should have put the teeth and some feet in that huge peach squishy
Please transform yourself in Frank the Stank! I love that character!
Demnnn actually did it
You should sooo do a full set of teeth, stick them together and put braces on them!
its a candy corn with feet
🎶 lil big feets 🎶
Well, at the end of the year we all know who’s going to be the least loved. I’ll give you a hint: he has HUMUNGOUS 🦶🏻
You could make an operation game with how many squishy body parts you have
Ik it wouldn’t of been much of a makeover but I wanted you to turn the mouth squishy into one of the clacking mouth toys with feet so bad 😭
🌈Good luck with the new baby!👶
You could out a donut in the mouth then it looks like it is eating the donut 🍩
you could have made a mister potato head with the bean alien thing 😭
When she was adding the sprinkles on the peep cat tooth thing she didn’t play the sprinkle song
I love the tooth cat
You could make a Dino with those feet.
make a mega human squish
Always suprises (in a good way) we love u moriah x
Moriah! Random question, where did you get the outer skirt for The Donut Queen, Queen of Donuts cosplay? I'm trying to do a cosplay with a hoop skirt but am having troubles finding a kind of skirt that fits over a hoop skirt. ❤
Moriah u should make one of the teeth an among us
I need the mini teeth as a litter of kittens for moma there
Please do a studio gibily series, the tooth would be great for this ( my neighbour totoro) and I think that you would be great at putting ur own spin on it x ❤
Taking 'taste the rainbow' to a slightly different level
Moriah, don't forget the seashel painting video, summer's almost over
you should've painted the teeth rainbow instead of the middle part of the mouth
You should make a monster out of the teeth and big random things you get
The upside down teeth look like the little totoro creatures in My Neighbour Totoro!
Imagine Moriah explaining the backstories of her squishies to her friends...
11:13 you missed the chance to say "guaranteethed"
When you flipped the tooth upside down I IMMEDIATELY thought of the mini Totoros 🤣
you could turn the teeth into Blobs
I wanna see her like, put the mouth into the peach. Sort of like the annoying orange, but peach style. Would love to see that!
Omg WAIT they kind of look like furby feet👀👀👀👀
U should make a vid of making a set of the cats made out of the tooth
Maybe she could made the mouth a sandwich and the feet maybe wings
she should do the unicorn
YOU BETTER DO A BIG ONE
Moriah is my ideal best friend 😂😂 she works so hard to make us happy with her content but also keeps some of her life private so that we're still comfortable with each other 😂😂😂😂 ❤❤❤
Could you possibly use the dentures for one of those big squishies?
You could’ve just made the teeth into a taco desert or something
I feel like Moriah should’ve put the feet on the daddy chicken in the chicken family😂
Love you Moriah! I was thinking for the dentures you could have carved out the back and make it rounded, then fill in the gap with the piped frosting-looking stuff and make it a macaron, but i don't know if thats possible.  Also, no sprinkle song :`(
I actually love little big feet’s a lot. He’s defiantly not what you’d usually do, but he’s special in his own, cute, and deeply way
SHE SHOULDA MADE THE TOOTH INTO A MOKKE FROM TBHK
“When you turn the tooth upside down it becomes totally different. Do you see it??” ME THINKING IT LOOKS LIKE BANBAN 😭😭💀
you should do a mini set of dessert cats with the teeth squishies!
ⓢⓐⓜⓔ ⓢⓗⓔ ⓘⓢ ⓢⓞ ⓕⓤⓝⓝⓨ
SHE DIDNT DO THE SPRINKLE SONG ON THE CAT
the little cat should be called sweet tooth!!
Who's been watching her even when she used popsicle sticks? I NEED TO KNOW!!!!!!
why didn't you play the sprinkle song?
Everyone who watches Moriah knows shes their favorite youtuber EVER!
You can make a family of tooth bunnies! pls do it🙏🏼
@Moriah just a good suggestion to a James and the giant peach type thing but with your characters I think this could be a really cute idea
I was really expecting a “sweet tooth”
This reminds me I still have to make an appointment with my dentist.
Don’t forget your annual seashell painting video!
Why was I expecting her to give one of those giant unicorns a pair of teeth
You should've turned the feet into cool shoes, it'd be better (in my opinion)
You could’ve added feet to the teeth roots
I like what Moriah did with the cat tooth but I think it would have been cooler and a better fit if she made it into one of the bunny creatures from My Neighbor Totoro.  But that's just me lol. Also is it just me or was the squishy she used for the bean body kawaii potato and not gudetama?
No sprinkle song? 😢 love you Moriah, say hi to the fam for me ❤❤❤
I gotta say, I was surprised she didn’t make a “sweet tooth”! Maybe a double waffle cone bottom and some kind of ice cream or icing top, a cherry, etc! Maybe a sweet tooth collection since she has so many!!!
You should have made a bunny wearing a teeth costume
Am I the only one who saw Totoro when she flipped the tooth upside down?
Here within 2 days ↓↓
If in doubt, paint it rainbow!
My favorite was the alien bean body it was cute in my opinion
Can you please try and like make a puzzle.It would be so cool
When you turned the tooth upside down, I thought it looked kind of like Totoro
She should have stuck the denture teeth on to one of the big unicorns
Little big feets should be Blue Foot cause it matches Big Foot
Hi Moriah!  Love your imagination & creativity to make all a reality!!!  Thank you for bringing us along.  I love your blobs.😊
for the teeth i was thinking a tooth fairy lol but i love what you did with it
8:01 WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE AN APPLE
Moriahhhhh! As soon as I saw the dentures, I thought of a clam with some eyes in the "gaping" area!! Absolutely love your videos! And I hope you're doing well!! ❤❤
i would add tooth gems to the teeth!!
Make a Family for the tiny Mingo
Please make a family for the tiny mango
You need to make the peach into a James and the Giant Peach Variation. Except with your characters ❤️🍑
Love the ideas, but for the teeth, you could’ve made them all one colour of the rainbow with maybe a face, and the feet could also work like that, and the mouth, could’ve made the teeth rainbow to…..but like that’s a lot of rainbow, still love them tho
Moriahs intro is the only intro I will never skip
OMG turn the set of teeth into a taco!!!!
3:33 I thought it was that potato guy from Toy Story
put eye balls on the theeth
Maybe adding a little face to each tooth? I don’t know that it would make it much worse lol
SHE FORGOT TO DO THE SPRINKLE SONG
OPPIE WHERE IS OPPIE?
... Well choosing the jaw.. teeth thing. Was a choice. It seems like you are trying to avoid the bigger squishy's...   While watching your video. Me and my siblings came up with an idea. You could turn the peach, into an animal. Kinda like your dragon fruit dalmatian! 😁
Was really hoping she'd combine the chocolate bar and dentures together.
I thpught for the mouth/teeth u were going to make it a dinosaur or smth w its mouth open
why blue.......why
Do the mango family❤
Everyone who is new to Moriah's videos whenever she is talking about all of her alien beanbody's probably have no clue what she is talking about 🤣. For those teeth you decorated,  you could have also made a pastel rainbow cake by taking some of your foam and making the middle of the teeth (the part you painted rainbow) and smoothed it off to where it is at level with the teeth and then make the top even instead of slanted. Then, you can paint the "teeth" different colors of the rainbow and make the top you evened out a cake color. You are awesome. I hope you are doing okay with you newborn and your family! 🥰
There were six feet you could of done rainbow
Please make spark available on android.
Give the denture squishy rainbow bracessssss  And donate it to a dentist office for children to squish when they feel scared
I've been waiting for this for years 😅
She didn't used to sprinkle song
I am so sorry but the first one would be better without the feet
Lil Big Feets has Mort eyes (from Madagascar)
Glad Moriah tricked us into thinking she was tackling one of the massive Squishies once more. 😂
The teeth could have been a burger or sandwich
Moriah is the art teacher I want❤❤
Not me ranging because she didn’t paint its toes/toenails rainbow or some cute design :(
I have an idea for the tooth squshie! If u make them look like little people! (Roots are like legs)
You totally should of put the peach a a mouth and put the tenth inside
I need more bean bodys
for the rainbow mouth thing you should put rainbow braces on it !! love your videos!!!v
Pls make more bean bodys
Moriah, you could have turned the teeth squishy into a taco by cutting the inside and the actual teeth and put scrap foam inside to look like taco filling. That would have been so cute!!
Moriah should make a graphic novel with her characters in it! Like if you agree
the giant peach could be james and the giant peach
I think you should of made the peach a mouth an put the teeth inside
you should make a cow squishy
HOW DID SHE KNOW MY HAND  WAS  UP 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That wink thoooooooooo oo
You should do the giant peach
I love that you hate velvet as much as me! Lol
When is the yearly Q&A
I think it would be cool if Mariah  customizes crocs and have the jibbitz be her characters
you could have used the feet as wings lol
It is furby
U forgot the spirinkle songggg 😭
Mariah make a game with the teeth !😊
Don’t do my gotatama like that
Can I just say that Lil Big Feets is simply adorable!!? I would love to see him make a return in the future!
8:41 I looks like the lil white creature from my neighbor totoro
The cat tooth turned out so cute!, since you can throw whatever shape and colour that you want into the mix!
☹️
That's a bunny
My only idea for a singular tooth is adding a crown to it, because well, yk, a tooth with a crown 🤣
The tooth, maybe with Toothfairy or halloween themed😅
I want a squishi but I don't have a squishi but I like that teeth with a rainbow cheese I think you live far away from my home  🏠 bye
i love her videos so much and love she protects her children
Just put chocolate fudge on a tooth, sprinkles and candy and call it a sweet tooth 🤷‍♂️
Do you remember rainbow the cat the completely rainbow cat
I actually really like the mouth one. Send it to meee
Make as many of those teeth squishies as the Sweet Tooth Kitties set ^^
Every single Friday I wait for her videos I love them Love you Maria
Moriah is the sweetest person ever
LIL BIG FEET I LOVE HIM/HER
Can u plss do a narwhal copy and paste
Are we not going to discuss her baby is like 2 weeks 🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊❤❤❤
Ok who's teeth squishy is that
The mouth one would have looked so cute with braces 🥹
The actual full mouth of teeth u should attempt to make into realistic looking mouth
Paint braces on the teeth squishies
Oooh giant unicorn with an upside down ice-cream cone horn? Please?
Hey Moriah! Im a hugeeee supporter and fan. And i have an idea for ur full mouth of teeth squishy !❤😊 🎉 You could put a design/pattern on each tooth, and then when ur creating another squishy or creation then you could grab ur mouth of desings and patterns and find a pattern on it to paint on another surface. U know, incase if ur brain is tired and cant think😊. I hope u find this comment helpful and thank u for all u do moriah :)
You’re getting so close to 10 million subs! I’ve been here since 3 million and it’s been several years of amazing content!!❤
My only thought for the giant set of choppers was to maybe add a cherry between the teeth? That way it could give reason for why they’re so freakishly gaped 🤣
Am I the only one who thought that the upside down teeth looked like the little bunny things from my neighbour totoro? 8:32
My aunts cat died last night and we have no idea how😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH SQUISHIE❤❤❤❤❤
he/she is kind of cute but the feet i don't like it
NOT THE POTATO
I love little big feets, I would have him as a pet
Hey moriah you could turn the teeth into among us characters c:
Idea: turn the alien bean body's into squishies
As soon as I saw the potato and the feet I thought MR POTATO!!! The toy from the uk!?
Raise your hand if you think Moriah is the best⚛  🖐
that squishy you thought was gudetama is actually tayto the potato by smoko. A they make plushies and other characters
these are probably my favorite you've ever made omg
They turned out good. Ok the teeth are still weird but they look better. The though I was having was that you could combine them into a monster, like how you used the feet but instead add it to the set of teeth and cut up a tooth to become ears or horns or something and make a weird creature, or attach them in some way to a giant squishy to be a giant weird monster. Though the mouth would still have been terrifying I’m sure. lol
awww
The tooth squishes can be made into some new blobs!!!!!
11:41
You should turn like 6 teeth Squishies into like braces teeth and give it to an orthodontist lol...or just make a whole family of teeth bunnycats
The upside down teeth look like Totoro!
Hi, do you have Spark for Android users 🥲
I love little big feet ❤ he’s my favorite 🤩
Moriah you forgot the sprinkle song
The mouth kinda looks like a macabun
I love your videos❤
i thought she was gonna turn the mouth into a taco
Make the big peach jerry the cherry
MORIAH YOU SHOULD USE THE PEACH AS A BEANBAG AND PUT SQUISHYS ON IT‼️⁉️
Why didn't you just gut it and make it a dessert taco? I'm guessing it would have taken too much time 🤔 I Love Squishies though
GURLY UR ON TRENDING-
U SHOULD HAVE CUT OUT THE TEETH OF THE DENTURES AND THE INSIDES AND PUT A ROUND SQUISHY PEARL IN IT!!!!!!
If you stare at the teeth from the right angle it actually looks like a macaron ❤
costumes a keyboard with your caricatures please
I would make upside down tooth squishies into chu Totoro and chibi totoro 🌱
I like this video. missed the sprinkel song. make an army of former tooth cats 🥳🥳👍🏻🦷🐱🐱🦊🦋🐺
It’s not a cat it’s a Cunny
I haven’t watched the vid yet but maybe make a tooth into a cartoon bunny thing with the roots (is that what they are?) as the ears. Update: I’m a frickin genius (so close)
Hah little big feets and I love the cat and honestly the teeth nobody could've fixed
Please do the jumbo squishy
I would have added wings on the back of the tooth and made it into a "tooth fairy" maybe?? 🤔🤷🏽‍♀️
already 21 trending
MORIAH - the summer is ending - DONT FORGET THE ANNUAL SEASHELL PAINTING VIDEO 🎨🐚
your so close to 10 m🎉
you did my idea without me knowing
You could have made the dentures into a clam or an oyster shell! Make the gums and teeth all one color, maybe paint a little pearl on the weird inside part.
PART 2
The mouth thing could've been a taco, lol
With one of the teeth you could turn it into the tooth fairy 🦷🦷😬🪥
No sprinkle song??? WHAT IS THIS BLASPHEMY 😢
With the tooth squishy I was thinking that she would make a tooth fairy not a cat
Santa pink
Love your videos😍
Could have done a set of rainbow braces, cut chunks out of the inside to make it seem like he was chewing strings of bubble gum
When i saw the dentures i immediately thought of a clam or an oyster or something where they have the pink bit in the middle that holds their shell together
turn the tooth squishy upsidown and make it a cat!
so mad you didn’t do a big one!!!
I’m am obsessed with Little Big Feets!!
One of they teeth make a cavity with rainbows shooting out of it
The tooth could have been used as a blob
You should try crocheting. I crochet and I think it is a really good idea for a video and a good activity for free time.
Absolutely loved tooth kitty!! Can you make her a family out of the rest of them?
You should paint a globe of nafalaphagus with locations and such❤
Using art supplies I’ve been avoiding to decorate a squishy 😁
The cat is actually adorable!!! 🥰
Did anyone notice she forgot to play the sprinkle song for tooth cat!? Nooooooooo!!! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!??!
Cutthe peach in half and put the Teeth in to make a mouth
I think you could maybe make more of the cat bunnie things? I think their soooooo cuuuuutteeeeeeeeee. And with the tooth with the crown i ciuld maybe be like a queen/king of the cat bunnie things. If you dont like to do any of the squishies again for some reason, you could just use them as squishy donators of just use them to fill "squishy birth wounds".
I looked at the last one(set of teeth) after the white coat was on and thougth "If the rim of the gums were gone it could look like a desert-sandwich the decorated ones that has a form almost like taco-sheel made from a flat tart(best description I can do)... I've seen ones in that kind of shape... with cream filling...
A (belated) idea for the dentures squishy: wouldn't it be so cool to have terrified little characters inside?
I just don’t understand how every time she holds a squishy she doesn’t have the urge to just ‘+-*SQUISH*-+’
I love how Moriah doesn’t change to get more views or whatever, like it’s just so calming 😊
we had the same idea for the teeth! you could always cut the toes off the feet to make a pear (that’s a weird sentence…)
I think moriah should do something relaxed bts or blackpink (please copy that i want it to be 😢)
You can you see a mouse?
WHAT ABOUT THE SPRINKLE SONG
i knocked my tooth out those teeth could do me a good wee job
Hiiii I'm a big fan can you pls paint a foosball table with your characters as the people ❤
and make a bunny out of the teeth
Where's opey?
you could use the toes as a rooster head piece....
Moriah where is opie ????
Omg I needed this
Why does the peach have a hole? 💀
Who else thinks Moriah successfully made a ugly cute squishy with little big feet’s and I LOVE HIM SO MUCH❤❤❤❤
Oh wow the mouth😭✌
She forgot her seashell video
Who thinks she is like so good in art?
Moriah I was thinking you could make the other feet like baby squid/jellyfish! But Little Big Feets is really cute, it's always fun to see what you can do with what you have. It's like creative therapy to watch your videos
I guess I missed it 😓
Need to make an entire series out of tooth-cats
I LOVE THE ALIEN HE IS MY FAVORITE BEAN BODY, if he was made into merch I would buy it so fast
hi you don't need to use the big squishy s for the thumb nail we qre still going to click on the video💗💗💓💓
Flip the teeth upside down and then you get a bunny
Stop hating on my tooth boy Timothy
Who thinks Moriah should paint life size squishy?  👇
I could see the last teeth being a fallen over cake, I don't know if it would've looked good on the back though. Love the cat tooth!
U should have added braces to the last one
You should do a dinosaur family of pickle and his girlfriend
wait is opie still around ): i havent seen him in years
You should make a Nahfalafagus cake
🌈Good luck with the new baby!👶
turn the teeth in to blobs 😮
can we name the mouth moutholomule ?
You should make a toothfairy out of one of the teeth!
I love little big feetsss
You should make the peach into jerry cherry or whatever he’s called
Had an idea, want to throw it into the universe. Custom computer keyboard.
The dentures could have been a cream filled puff dessert! Love your videos ❤️🧡💛💚🩵💜🩷
#12 on trending 😆
As one mother to another your drive and creativity are incredible and you are doing so amazing, you are the greatest role model for your children and I can bet they will be doing amazing and creative things as they grow up too!
what about the seashells....
I think of mr. Potato Head when you added the feet😂
I absolutely adore that she speaks to us like we actually know her in real life and how she jokes. By the way i love that new bean body! Its actually kinda cute!
Little big feet’s is my favorite
The teeth up side down look like the bunny from totaro
The teeth one- a taco
I love how they all came out but I think the mouth could’ve been like a cute clam shell with a character or pearl in it, love you Moriah! <33
Coulda put the dentures inside the giant peach lol
Am I the only one that thinks she could’ve turned the mouth squishy into an animal, hiding in a seashell
Hi
The feet alien bean body should meet mister feets, cosmo cat’s asteroid 😂
You should make bean body’s a series
i thought the alien bean body was gonna be mr potatohead
The candy bar people could be made into Nahfalafags versions, just without the arms/legs. Like you did with the cupcake
A idea I had for the dentures squishy is making it to a clam
Please do a part 2 and do the peach!!!I have been wanting you to do it forever
Moriah you should try to make a chinchilla squishy!!!
Maybe the full set of teeth could be the characters you have invented for each tooth😅
GIRL PAINT YO BIG SQUISHYES😡👿😤
You make WAYYY too many alien bean bodys
u slayyy the day away
Oml this video was amazing! I’d like to see this as a new series. (Lol sorry that sounds demanding but I just really liked how these turned out. Especially the bean body.)
Toth cat you forgot the SPRINKLER SONG!!!!!!!ಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ
Among us
I would have put a donut in the dentures to make it look as if a person were eating a RaINb0w donut
Moriah, my dad and I watch you ever Saturday morning, it is quite literally our favorite thing to do together!! Love you so much❤️
Moriah , you should make custom hangers for your kids 🎉🎉🎉 keep up the good work ❤
the teeth squishy is actually kind of cool! if you added golden tooth, or some tooth jewellery and i could see it being like an avant guard piece ahahaha
2:01 why are you doing this
Is it only me or where was the sprinkle song?
Tooth Kitty & Bean Feetz
What if you make a bunnies and cats with all the teeth
What happened to the blobs 😭😭😭😭
i am severely disappointed that you didn't paint the bean body's toenail's
the "what the heck is she talking about" is so funny to me🤣
Moriah pls make spark in canada 🇨🇦 I want to use your app but it won’t let me plsssss❤😊😊😊😊
1 name baby foot
I love the cat one 🥰
Hi I never watched you in a while but now I'm watching you again
I wish I was as good at art as she was
I know I shouldn’t be here but WHO WANTS MORIAH TO FINALLY MAKE A PART TWO TO THE PANDA BUN VIDEO??
First one has cold feet
Moriah can literally take anything ugly and make it look beautiful❤
Is it just me but she should’ve made the mouth/teeth squishy into a clam, idk I think I’d would look rly cute
No bc I love the feet on the bean body. Now we need a small bean body w obnoxiously large feet
All these squishies I have an idea for
It funny that she took them and made them like the ones she loves
I absolutly love Little Big Feets!! I want merch of him so bad he's so cute!
So, here's an idea for the teeth. Make one each with fairy wings for your kids for when the first baby tooth falls out. Their own personal tooth fairy. If you wanna  go the money-for-teeth routine, put it in with their first payment and a sweet letter by the 'real' tooth fairy?
its ok little big feets we love you <3
Moriah you can do a dessert cat family with those tooth
Moriah should paint a Cat house for Opie Blow this up for her to see it Copy the same to let her se it.....
I present to you Mr feet😂😂😂
Instead of making rainbow cheese you should have made a burger inside of the mouth
Lil big feets = my new fav ❤thanks moriah 🎉
You should call the cat "Callie the chocolate caramel calico cat"!
the teeth could maybe turn into the bean bodys from Zoloponoplolisissdbdoebw
U should put the denture teeth in the peach!!!
You should make a panda inside the peach squishy!
With the teeth u could add feet and eyes and it could be the wind up teeth toys
Ideas!! You should make a sibling/cousin for the alien bean body but give it moth wings and don’t add pupils, when I saw it’s eyes just in brown it reminded me of a moth lol  Do a part 2 but only allowed to use the squishy you was avoiding! So it just has to be the squishy you was avoiding (Just a foot squishy.. just a giant squishy, etc)
I wish the first squishy had brown foot that would have make it better  Right now honestly the blue just looks odd..
lil big feets is literally my favorite squishy this year  edit: MORIAH YOU COULDVE MADE THE TEETH INTO A DEFORMED TACO!!!!!  edit 2: yes i liked my own comment
Okay. Hear me out. Eliminate the teeth squishies by painting them into animals with the stile of this bunny. You’ll be rid of them
The alien bean body is pretty mush a permanent Mr potato head
You make beautiful things out of them❤
I love you sooooooo much
I wanted to see big feets as a drawing 😊
Hi Moriah, was wondering if you could make a video where you react to your toddlers and tiaras videos with Sam!
Soo whats with the eyebag moriah😂 make sure to stay healthy❤
The dentures could easily be turned into a desert taco
Can you do a bake with me vid.    👇
IM KINDA EARLY
PIN THIS and I will send u 10 squishy’s
Is it just me, or is the bean body alien cuter when the colours are all changed up at 7:28..
Moriah, the bean bodies are a big part of your chanel so I'd like to know: does little big feets have a nickname? 😅
I was really hoping for her to do one of the big squishy
When will us in other countries be able to get Spark!!!!
The teeth could have been Totoro
Make each tooth gross like one with plaque and stuff
Can you pls use or big squishy
WHY IS THERE SO MANY TEETH
😂😂😂😂❤❤😢😮😅🐈💘🐰🐥🐈🤟🇧🇫🐰💜
No because I’m still waiting for the big pig squishy. It’s been so longgggg. PLEASE PAINT IT!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Make a Halloween thing out of the set of teeth
You can make one of the tooth an ancient artefact type thing like it belonged to a beast or smthing
Anyone else hoping she'd make a STAR WARS ewok?
Very thoughtful and innovative. The kitty was a great idea
She should've made the tooth into a tooth fairy 😔
Who else was desperately hoping she’d pick one of the giant ones bt knew deep down she wouldn’t 😂?
PLEASE do two squishies, two friends one of them is panda and the other one is koala but panda is in koala suit and koala is in panda suit 🥺🙏💕
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Omg i yes they turned out so funny lol! I had an idea for the set of teeth if you ever get another one… possibly a taco? Like, a rly fat taco? Idk it could work lol. I love you videos  ❤✨❤✨❤
Now we can say than she is the ✨ TOOTH FAIRY ✨✨
Moriah is the best person!I mean who wouldnt want to watch her!!<3 I had an idea of making the gums Into a cake (the teeth could be frosting and put some other squishies for toppings)but what she did was really creative and GORGEOUS!!<33
Ive been excited for the teeth Squishies! Every time I see them, I see the little Totoro sprites. I think they're the perfect shape for those
my favourite one was the cat
Idea for you, use the feet on the set off teeth to make those chatering teeth things
Moriah, I love you, and I love your art. Please don't do this again. You do your best when you create something you love ❤️
Who just loves this girls Humor?
I love watching Moriah thank you moriah!
she should do a cooking video
Sprinkle song noooooo still i love u
Ok...hear me out....put the denchers into ine of the big unicorns mouths.......
Okay listen wouldn’t it really cool if Moriah customized a doll house.I know she just did the chess set but it dosed have to be a big doll house it can be a small one. Please Moriah,consider this.
I love that she doesnt say something like subcribe or thoes things
Turn the teeth upside down and then it will be a blob whit ears
i love watching your videos
little big feet is actually kinda cute😭
Always perfect and fun 😊
Omg the chocolate bar people should be some more aliens from Nahfalafagus! Like another people or tribe on the opposite side of the planet
From the jaw squishy one could make a clam, after some major reshaping...maybe that would be a better use of it? Anyways, great video. :)
OMG MORIAH YOU COULD MAKE MORE TEETH SQUISHIES INTO CHARACTERS THAT ARE IN TOTORO!!!
I think you should have added rainbow braces too
You are not seeing my comments
You are the best person on this planet
the mouth full of teeth could have been a burger with bacon and lettus bits on poking out. But I am not creative at all so I'm just going to shut up about it. Lovely teeth came out of the clean up. My fav though was the single tooth to kitty.
Moriah you could have made the dentures into a macaron
Random thought on the tooth squishies: if you cut the root bits off, you essentially have a blob!
Comment bomb   Moriah should turn make a squishy version of herself
idk if i'm the only one who thought of ricky, moriah's old character when i saw the set of teeth! i think he's only been featured in drawing form but he has a huge smile like that if i remember correctly
I actually really like little big feets
My birthday was recently, and all I asked for were Moriah products!!!!😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
your makeing a big painted wall
the mouth squishy would have been so good as a burger and cince the back is smaller you could add a rapper there
A Thoth upside down kinda looks like a bunny
I LOVE LITTLE BIG FEETS
ok but when you do the peach th eworld will be finally at peace
You should have made the tooth a "sweet tooth"! Kinda corny, but it would have been really cute
Watching you while painting flowers❤
Who else what’s pt2?  👇
The mouth one, I thought you'd make it bite a 🍩 donut
Little big feets.✋️🥹 Literally my favourite ailen bean body character you've made.🩵
Can you plzzzz do digital arts into squishies plzzzzzzzz😊 I love your videos 🩷, one of yours video came in my recommendation and I love it and watched all your videos and I love all of them☺️
You should make a whole teeth cat family
You could use some of the tooth squishies and turn them into slimes
My first thought was to cut the peace open and make a big horrible mouth full of teeth. A toothy peach.
Can u do from the hopeless bin next :D
The upside down tooth is a Totoro not a cat or bunny sheesh!!!
I love this idea 😂
moriah u forgot the sprinkle songggggggggggggggg
Can you please do ester eggs 🥚
I really thought you was going to make the set of teeth into a desert taco or like a cream puff ❤😂
IMO, Moriah’s go-to safety net IS her alien bean bodies. C’mon, girl, i love you, but ideas, man😅
My favorite was the bigfoot
You could make the peach be all rainbow and have a bite out of it for the mouth  Also please please please make a Cousin Derp pencil  case, the shape would suit him perfectly and since he's a hungry little guy it would suit him so well
You could make that mouth thing a taco
I love all of it and I appreciate the effort put in but I think u could have made the teeth or what I call a jaw into a cake slice/desert but still loved it.
Hasn’t she already done this?
I think we could call the calico cat caramel ❤
Idk if this idea was already given but for the set of teeth it could be a leaning cake tower
My favorite squishy is the cat
9:24 SHE DIDNT DO THE SPRINKLE SONG 😡
you did not play the sprinkle song on the cat
I really love what she made with the tooth squishy, Moriah is just SOOOO creative 🙌💖💖
I love the results!✨🌺 Is there going to be Spark for Android people? If yes then when will it be out? I really wanna try the app out! =D anyways, I love your videos so much! I wish you good luck in the future and now✨
She should had put rainbow braices on the set of teeth
Say hello to. The viewer   that hasn't been watching since one year ago😅
She could have made the teeth into a blob group photo scene each tooth a blob and the top row hanging blobs and the top gums being ceiling the inside being a giant pillar
I love the first one so much!!
Guys remind moriah of the annual seashell painting video
Why didn’t you make a butt crack on that Cat/Rabbit 😩😩😩
I have an idea for one of your videos: So you can try making a ✨DRAGON PUPPET✨ you can find tutorials over here on yt...
The feet could be  cut into wing like shapes. The teeth could be rounded more at top or flowers added to make plants or a new species....known as the jelly beings (rainbow ofc). The mouth....could be rainbow and you could make a dentist squishy (a little cute bug with glasses)
I love you Moriah!!! Watching your videos always makes me happy!
I was going to say that the last one would be low in the ranking but moriah said it herself
/e pin
Moriah can you make a baking  videos for me
Triple doughnut dare you to turn the teeth into a big cat family xD
Teeth = Fruit, Teeth + Gums = Burgers or a cupcake... The rest....
UMM EXUSE ME YOU DIDNT DO THE SPRINKLE SONG WHEN YOU WERE ADDING SPRINKLES ONTO THECHOCOLATE ON THE CAT WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
yk for the mouth squishy u could have putted a donut to make it seem like its eating it
The giant peach would be perfect for planet Nahfalafagus
Turn yourself into the face of failer
Moriah: do you see what it is? Me: A WOODLAND SPRITE!
I think making the mouth squishi have like adessert in its mouth woldve been qmazing
Moriah, yoy should make the peach into a life sized naufologian berry of your choice 🙃
You should use the peach and the teeth 🦷 and make a GIANT blob squishy
Who wants part 2👇
YOH FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG IN THE THEETH 😱🤣🦷
You forgot the sprinkle song😮😂
the upside down tooth lookes likr totoro from my neighbor totoro
The potato character was created by smoko and their name is Tayto
Moriah is the reason why I haven’t deleted YouTube.  She brings back my inner childhood. Her videos r the ones that’ll never get outdated or boring 🤧👌🏻
Ik you can’t change it now but you could’ve made it teeth with a little tooth monster
I want a little big feetss squishy plush
Please do another bake with me!!!!!
For the front cover with the pink chocolate I have the EXACT same squishy!💖🍫
HORRAYYYYY I NEW IT WOULD HHAPPEN SOME DDAYYYYY
I love you
Moriah u HAVE to make a GIANT squishy!!
Please save pimple
Maybe could've cut the teeth off the mouth and made some kind of taco
Am i t'he only one that loves everything Moriah does? ❤❤❤
For the tooth, I think you can create a person. Like the legs are the bottom and his arms are inside of him like holding something. Please do this! I love your videos!💝
Hey Moriah maybe in your next video you could do a series were you make all of your Been bodies into squishies. What do you think?
Make the bean body's into squishmallow type Teddy's it would be soooo cute
Next time do more baking ppppppllllllleeeeaaasssee
You could've turned the set of teeth on it's back and made it into a dessert taco, or waffle. With the teeth as the cream!
pls pls pls make the alien bean bodies into squishies!!!!!  I would LOVE that
When i saw the whole mouth - teeth one i immediately thought of a design, GO!GO! ZEPPELI!, Gyro's teeth from JoJo's bizarre adventure 🤣. It could have been an awesome design but i love what you went with!❤❤
SHOULD HAVE DONE A DONUT IN THE TEETH
I love little big foot <3
For the mouth squishy you could've cut the thing out of the middle and made it like a clam with and animal inside
Oo you could change the giant peach into a pumpkin for Halloween! Moriah I love your videos 🎉❤
Love your Videos 💞
Who else remembers the days she said she hated using paintbrushes to paint squishes cause she liked popsicles better😭🫶🏼
I usually dont comment but i iust love lilbigfeetz!
Can you turn the rest of the tooth into a totoro set please
pls make a Bluetooth I really want to see what personality you give it
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
You could've actually turned the mouth squishy into a small backpack or something, it looks really similar to a backpack. The teeth could've been a zipper
The dentures IMMEEDIATLY reminded me of shark boy and lava girl and the little metal teeth with eyes
Moriah you could of had really made a desert out of the set of teeth😢❤
Oh my gosh, I was about to comment that you could make the teeth bunnies instead. But seems like Moriah already read my mind 🤯
You could stick the feet on the tooth squishy and make it look like the little tooth things are legs just an idea
Love you so much ❤
Hats off Moriah!!! Taking care of ur new born child while making the most difficult to work with squishy look like THESE  is a talenttttt!!!!!!!!!
What happen to opie
the cat is so cute. it needs a name
This was such a great creative challenge!! You absolutely crushed all of them working with what you had! Also, I can't be the only one who thinks Lil Big Feets would make THE BEST plushie, right??
*Ofense the squishes fans sended lol
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
I would propapably make some kind of sandwich from the mouth/teeth🤔
The feet were so ugly! ;)
When I first heard Moriah mention that people get mad when she doesn't do the sprinkle song, only then did I start to notice that sometimes she forgets it. But now it slightly bugs me, but I don't want to be the person who shouts and demand for the sprinkle song. But yeah, lately I have been missing the sprinkle song
Design idea for the teeth make the blob characters the bottom of the tooth is the legs
i know for a fact that a dentists office would loooove the dentures
Little Big Feets is so cuteee❤
Make a cute family of cats with the teeth! Didn't seem to take long and it would be adorable! Different desserts maybe?
It's like the TV show, Bing and bong alien love that shows aliens have a couch attached to a string, he got the string launch off into space and save a planet in need. This is some episodes on YouTube being a bong. Just being a kind of alien language, not really talk, but my favorite show as a kid. Hole in space there was a theme song.
Please make a doll house for your daughter
I litterally laughed so hard when she said, "so maybe we call it, BIG fEEt ssss, BIG FEEtSs" LOL😂
OO THE TOOTH COLLECTION CAN BE LIKE A WHOLE KINGDOM OF ANIMALS. OR LIKE BUNNIES VS CATS.
hi pls make spark on adiroid
I really enjoyed watching this video!!!😊 Please do this kind of squishy makeover again❣ Also, the infamous mouth or teeth dentures kind of look like a sandwich with some rainbow colored jam in it🌈🥪 Maybe you can turn it into a sandwich at the re-doing your old squishies video!💕
A tooth with rainbow wings could be a little tooth fairy...
Those chocolate people I also in the squishy makeover app. I think it's a knock off shotgun looking at the weird eyes.they even have a chocolate character, but theirs looks much cuter hahahah😂❤🎉😊
Now I got a funny idea with them teeth. You could now make a whole family of these cat creatures and their house being the big peach hollowed out. All of em cozy in there. Gets you rid of some teeth and that peach in a cute way I think🙃
Sprinkler song....😂
Why is it that when you do something that you dont want to do, it is beyond amazing. I absolutely loved everything you did. You are so creative that its amazing.
Moriah! I've gotten an idea for the denchers or how ever you say them! But I think it's a bit too late, soo my idea was you smooth off the back so it looks like a bun and then add animal ears to the top and paint it like an animal in a puff pastry or something
The peach is obviously a giant Jerry the cherry with that luscious but crack!
You could make the peach a mafalafagus strawberry 🍓
I think you should accept defeat (de-feet- haha!!) and  remake the mouth squish into a dessert. It looks like a layered cake that at an angle- you could totally add some kind of layers of fruit or frosting designs and disguise the teeth. Or, you could turn the mouth INTO the actual grilled cheese with the top and bottom being the bread (Which is why I thought you were going when you brought up the sandwich!).   I have faith in you that you can do better then the weirdo rainbow dentures.   Ps. Congrats on baby #2. I hope you're all doing well and getting some sleep!
The Face on the yellow foot looks exactly like the face of one of those goat/sheep things from this one Chinese cartoon. It's about these two wolves trying to eat the sheep and the sheep are like in this place where they're safe and the wolf always gets beat up by the queen wolf who I think was his girlfriend or something? It's kind of like the Chinese tom and jerry.   Please tell me someone else knows what I'm talking about
i hope she didnt forget about the annual seashell painting
Squishy idea : pet monkey called sprinkles for donut queen
I feel like if she smoothed it out with puffy paint she coulda made it into one of those strawberry sandwiches i see a lot in Japan or something similar to the StrawBEARy scone thingy
We should call the teeth teddy, teddy the teeth. 😊
Okay but hear me out. If she would have painted like big googely eyes on top of the teeth it would've been way better
Okay but I want the teeth so bad now
You should make a hive of those cat tooth. They are in a hive of teeth and then come out as cats!!
The mouth could have been an open backpack
(writing this before the makeover so idk what happens) you could make a set of dark, milk and white chocolate +1 rainbow lmaoo
Oh my I forgot the be in my other comment😅😅
You should make all the teeth into a dessert cat family!!
The teeth I think should rainbow 🌈 pastel the whole set of the teeth
she didn't do the sprinkle song with the tooth squashy
Won't it be fun if moriah could do a painting challenge on  MS paint and try to make something decent? Like if u want to see such a vdo
I'm your late you will never know how I hot this many likes.💀
Idea if you turn the teeth/ jaw on its side so the tenth are pointing up it kinda could be made into a taco😅
If you turn the individual tooth upside down it looks like a little arm/legless cat/rabbit/dog etc  *nevermind: just watched the video and you said that anyway*
Do the teeth as teeth but eating a donut
great creations! How about a tooth fairy for making use for the rest of the teeth-squishies?☺️🙌
I LOVE LITTLE BIG FEET'S ☹☹☹
Toddler-mini ME baby-miniER ME
Totally weird thought for the set of teeth, flip it sideways and make a desert taco, the teeth reminded me of frosting and the space in the middle can be made into filling?
Nice
11:12 you could do rainbow braces....?
I thought Moriah was going to remove the middle of the mouth and make it a cookie 😅
i think moriah should do a part 2 of this, maybe she chould do one of the giant squishes and the chocolate bar(s) i think it will fun🥰 love you moriah
I love the way the first two turned out.  For the teeth, I think it would be fun to remove the middle section altogether then glue to top and bottom together again.  Then cut a hole in the face of one of the giant squishes, shove the teeth in and voila!! 😁
If you do get another set of dentures, I would attempt to make a chest mimic! That’s what I thought of when I saw. Like the eyes on the inside piece and the outside being chest decorated and keeping the teeth! Your creations are so cute!
Maybe u should make more cats out the tooth squishes so they could be friends or siblings!
Omg I LOVE the tooth makeover!! 🐱🦷🍩
I wish u added rainbow braces that would be so funny ❤😂
Please work on the chocolate bar character in an episode 2 of this video!
Pls part 2 plsss
Moriah probably has a MEme for every situation 😂😂❤
You should turn your teeth into amoung us characters
Tooth idea: give them arms and a onesies of ur characters (use roots as feet) hope you use this but you don’t have to! xx
i love how every year or so i find your account and get obsessed
For your next “fixing things i’ve ruined”: turn the mouth thing into a taco! (Or maybe even a burger?)  Also: I absolutely loved how unique the ‘alien bean body’ came out. I would love more squishy makeovers where you just put random limbs together to just create a whole new character/animal/creature. I think the color scheme was a bit of fail tho but that’s okay. At least you tried something outside of your comfort zone and it was quite a succes if you ask me! Great video :)
You could of made the mouth 👄 squishy a desert
Who wants to se Moriah make paper dragon's
Why do the upside down teeth remind me of totoro?
I don't even know how she mamaged to pull those off but she sure did! Amazing. 👏👏👏
before she added the other things on the first squishy it kinda looked like mr potato head if he took off his shoes 😭😭
Peach : giant nofalofigus berry 😂😊
To be honest i though she was gonna turn the teeth into a icream sandwich
The mouth squishy kinda looks like a taco
about tooth/teeth? squshies - upside down they look like mini tottoro
YOU DODT PLAY SPRINKCUL SONG
For the disturbing mouth, maybe it could be an ice cream sandwhich or some kind of dessert, just so e food for thought if you ever revisit the idea. Pun not intended, but im also not apologizing for it either.
Moriah is the best!😊
Do a rainbow teeth family
You destroyed, the most cute squishy ever 😢
NOOOOO CARAMEL CHOCOLATE CAT HAS NO TAILL 💔💔💔💔💔
11:10 these teeth look like a sweet taco, like with a bunch of cream and etc
She didn't do the sprinkle song!!!!!!!!!!😮
U could of made the mouth in to s’mores because the teeth could be marshmallows I’m just saying
Same
Is it only me who wants to see an entire family of up-side-down tooth-based animals?
please sculpt a rainbow sandwich to go with
I was hoping she would make the tooth into a dessert so it would be a sweet tooth, maybe next time!
It would be great if she customize markets case of markets btw love you
It's a strawberry macaroon desert taco, teeth are whipped cream!
MORIAH U FORGOT DA SPRINKLE SONG!!!!😭😭😭😭
moriah never gets boring to watch because she always makes so many different things with so many different jokes while also protecting her childrens privacy
My  mouth squishy idea make braces
I really like the alien bean body it is sooooooooooo cute
Add some gold and or jewels to the teeth!!!
These are the most weirdest squishy things ever. AND I LOVE THEM ❤
Do a reversible ice cream
Can you do your biggest squishy you have please  😊🥺
OMGGGG SOOO CUTEEE also i have another idea for the dentures it could have been a seashell of some sort mby?
Yòni corn
i wouldve turned the mouth one into an open clam shell with something inside
For some reason i thought the dentures were gonna be turnef into like a weird food taco ice cream sandwich thing
You should off made the mouth squishy into a macaroon
You should use one of the smaller tooth’s and make a baby cat! Your so creative as well
CAT BLOB! Moriah!!! You literally read my mind! 🎉
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Upside down tooth remind me of a cat or something with pointy ears/hair Edit. @8:30 how did I guess
Your my childhood
I would’ve taken the Center of the mouth out & cut off the back until all I had was 2 rows of teeth & then I would have added them to one of the big squishies to make a big toothy grin Edit: it would be creepy cute on a unicorn 😂
why does the bean thingy look like the fricking potato off toy story 😭
REMINDER TO DO THE YEARLY QNA
The first and second are so cute!!!! ❤
Hiiiiii
Am i the only one jamin to the opening and do the 'boy' ✌️
An idea for another tooth squishy a ballerina blob squishy the roots of the tooth could be pointed toes on the blob and you could probably use a scrunchy hair band as a tootoo!
I have a calico Cat
You should make a key board each letter is one of your characters pls  Like and repost this so Moriah can see this ❤
What if you had put the mouth/teeth Thing into a giant Squishy and Cut Out the inner Part and Put a smal Squishy into the mouth :)  The giant eating the smal one
8:54  when she called the cat a jerk.was not expecting that 😂😂😂
You should have put a donut in the moutg being bitten
The tooth remembers me of the little creatures frame Totoro 😂
me mad after she didnt play sprinkle song
You should turn one of the teeth squishy into Totoro from my neighbor Totoro, hopefully I spelt it right lol
its Fall ... she forgot the yearly sea shell video :(
On the teeth you didn’t do the sprinkle song😢❤
BODY PARTS EVERYWHERE
Catbunny
I can’t be the only one who thought the upside tooth looks like Chibi Totoro
please a collection of tooth painted squishies as cats/bunnies <3
Where was the sprinkle song
Petition for her to add eyes to the mouth!
I can’t explain how much I love big feets I am obsessed with this creature of the night
I saw a macaroon or desert with the teeth 😂 love her vids💚💚
Pleeeeeees do more❤❤❤
who else wanted her to paint braces on the teeth squishy 🤚
Morgan please do a part 2
Part 2!
Interesting concepts for these odd squishies. Though just for thought for the last one, you could have made it into like a taco or burger style. Maybe a dessert type with its shape
You could turn the teeth into  Chibi-Totoros ❤ they would be so cute!
Moriah will you please use the shirt printing  kit that you bought in your shop with me video🤗
Hallo Moriah I hope it's going good with you your husband and your baby . I love your videos you inspire so many people . I watch your videos every week I am soooooo exited for next week's video❤ ❤❤❤
Use the teeth and make tooth cake.. like a tooth fairy cake
She can turn that tooth into amoung us character 👍
It's a bunny not a cat
Because of my timezone (I'm from 🇫🇷) I know that the video comes out during the night between Friday und Saturday , so I can start my weekend the best way possible by watching your vids during my breakfast 😊
You need to do a calico cat eating a crossiant ……..
could've turned the set of teeth into a taco
9:20 the bunny cat was mad for removing the spot near his eye 😂😂
I'm watching her wayyyy more punctually than I ever am in studies! Her videos are actually intertaining!❤️😻
Descet cat lookks like mega chubs or tiger
ᑭᒪᗴᗩՏᗴ Do the big unicorn squishe
Ngl I was hoping the teeth could be turned into a cake lol
I miss squishy ghost 😔👻 he needs to make a return lol
I think there should be a name for the cat squishy. I would like to name it Choco Charmi . (please no hate)
Where was the sprinkle song
You need to make a family of the desert Bunny please
Make a giant squishy with all the teeth as it's mouth 😂
You should make a scwisheey that is made out of all different scwisheeys
Please do one of the big squishes 🙏
IT'S BAN-BAN!!! THE TOOTH IS BAN-BAN
Why not make a sweet tooth?
Oh I'm so tired of her making her stupid alien bean bodies       this is a joke
Moriah you could take the other teeth and make a Bell pepper family could be cute
You should make a dessert tooth, and call it a sweet tooth.
the teeth ended up looking like a macaron lol
my sister loves your videos but l think there very dum why do you zoom up on your face
Do you have dentist friends? I feel like they would love the teeth
Moriah can you please make a horse squishie? I think it would be really cool! (It’s ok if not)
Moriah is truly the best person in YouTube.
u will never know why i got so many likes
You should have put cheese dripping
I will never get tired of your bean squishes in fact make more cute animals from teeth!!
Why do feet squishies exist? o-o Ones with generic faces too that look like they were meant as random cheap gifts for kids. What's the point? Are there hand squishies? Maybe random elbows somewhere? It's quite weird.
10 hrs agooo
She missed the chance to make the teeth into mini totoros:(
ME “ugh, no one is going to watch my intro!”  Me, rewatching the SAME intro 5 times
Please can u do one of the massive unicorn squishies!
I was surprised when she turned the tooth into a cat because I was actually thinking it might look good as a cat
Moriah add ping pong eyes to the mouth teeth squishy to make feel more like a character than just a random open mouth squishy
When is spark going to be on Android users I can't wait
DO A PART TWO NOW 👹👺👹👺👹👺👹👺👹👺👹👺👹👺👹👺👹👺👹👺👹👺👹👺
hhii
She makes us all so happy every Friday ☺️
It mr potato
Part 2 plsssssssssssssssssss
I think the chocolate caramel cat is really cute, I like how you flipped the problem on its head XD
"Hate is a strong word...😅"   "I HATE IT. 👹"
Do teeth..have teeth..?!
Make teeth family pls
You should do a video where you paint squishes as goths 😂
Anyone else sad that Moriah hasn’t done her annual seashell painting video
Sooo, the reason you probably see so many tooth squishes is because dentist actually give them out. There are websites for marketing businesses and they have them. I know this because I helped my boss market our chiropractic office and there are spine squishes as well.
Omg stop no i actually love little big feets so so much, the big brown eye patches and the feetsies it’s so cute!!
Hey Moriah. Thankyou for the video. Those squishies are amazing. Just wondering if there’s any chance you could let us meet your baby one time like we did with Mini Me? Xx
--feetFinder has entred the chat---
You should have made a hobbit with the big feeet!😢
you should make a series of making desert cats out of teeth!!
The gum squishy could get any weirder if Moriah add some colorful gummy worms coming out of it! Lmao just some idea!
Hello Moriah! My daughter had a great idea for your tooth squishy collection when watching this video! We felt it was a very “Moriah-like” idea: A dessert themed set of teeth - called your Sweet Tooth Collection!   Hopefully this inspires you to be a little more excited about working with them at some point in the future.  Also, a very belated Congrats!! to you and your expanding family!
The sprinkle song 😭😭😭😭😭😭
The sprinkle song 😭😭😭😭😭😭
The first alien bean body just reminds me a popsicle lol!
Creative Idea for the teeth: I would paint the inner part dark and paint different characters on them as bracket caps.
The art of squish is to fine for any one (apart from her)
So when are we getting the Nofologian storybook?
So a bean body is a mister potato head...got it.
Yes ! I was waiting so much to see you do that ❤😅
i love all these squishies but i couldn't stop thinking about how she couldve add grills to the last one!
What if the rainbow in the mouth drooled out over the teeth.  Can you taste the rainbow?
I love moriah
Omg I love little big feets😭❤
I'd love to see an unicorn creation!!!
She could've turned the teeth into a macaroon and added it to something but still great job ❤😊
Only the ogs will remember the ✨ panda buns ✨
Little beeet feeets is just amazing
You could make among us characters out of the teeth!
This is another reminder for the annual seashell painting video!!!!!! 👇🏻
Now that you brought him up, you should make a Gudetama like squish. Id squish it.
Hello I am 10 hours late
If you turn the teeth upside down, you can make a cat
She NEEDS to make pikle pick in to a plushy
Ok so I’ve had a weird, WEIRD idea for your tooth squishies. You know the idea of a “sweet tooth”? What if you make a series of teeth characters of different flavor preferences? “Sweet tooth” being like a bubblegum pink and cutesy and such, “spice tooth” being bright red and having an attitude, etc.? I’ve put too much thought into this 😂
You should make a whole life like person out of squishie parts!
Who loves moriah  👇🏻
If I had to design foot Squishies I'd design flipflops/ sandals / sliders
Next time you have feet, you should probably use it to make a bunny squishy because their back feet look like those feet to paint the color that Fia and that would be very cute❤
Do it agan plz i love it
Remember when moriah elizabeth made the rainbow paint tube squishy, it looks like that mouth squishy drank the paint 😂😂
She couldve turned the mouth squishy into a clam shell 😮😢❤
Shel is practically a tooth fairy 😂
You should make squishes for your baby’s
For the tooth squishy, I think turning the tooth into a fairy would be cute and also because of "tooth fairy" haha
You could have had the teeth biting into something, like a donut!
you can also use a tooth plushy as pants for a squishy
For the tooth I would've added an animal and made it a tooth fairy holding a tooth😂😂😂
The dentures could have been a clam… maybe
Hi Moriah sorry if I spent it wrong I have a idea for your second baby's name it should be miniature me or pocket me
Mariah I love that you do soooo much for us but you could have done the mouth Upside down and turn it into a taco
Am in love with all of them😂❤
I actually really love the teeth 😅
Heyyyyyy. Anyone else wanna hear more about the *teenie* me😊
Moriah you should add rainbow braces to the teeth!!!
Hi Moriah I really hope this terns into a comment bomb but  Can you please do a video of you making jibbitz of your own characters for Crocs ❤ I hope you have an amazing day or night and consider this idea I would love to see your own jibbitz in your store from your #1fan Gracie 😁
Big feets is actually so cute omw.
The tooth upside down reminds me of the little guy from my neighbor toroto
That first alien made me think of Captain Caveman with just the feet, lol. Yes, I just dated myself.
I cried when you RUINED the innocent potato😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The teeth set could be seen as a bag from another angle
Moriah should make a puzzle I feel like it would look cool!!!
I just wanted to say in the instance that someone is unappreciative of your art.... are they really a moriah fan...  I mean we are watching your imagination come to life... how much better can that get..❤❤... ok I'm sure it could get fantastic  but you get my point. .
make spark availably on android!!!
Now we need momma big feet for little big feet
Your videos bring me so much joy thank you so much for uploading🎉🎉🎉🎉
you should turn the teeth squishys into a giant set of teeth lol
Suggestion for feet squishies: Hobbits! 😉
Lol the teeth remind me of the OG snapchat filter where you throw up rainbow
You could've made the mouth a sea shell with a bean inside
Oh my gosh you should cut a giant mouth into the big peach squishy and fill it with skuishy teeth! A horrible creation for some horrible teeth squishies!!
Can you please do the big unicorn
if so tell next video please
Plz make a vid on spark creators sparks
Did you have your baby
I think the name 'Big Foot' or 'Big Feets' actually makes more sense on a small creature with oversized feet. Love the vid as usual!
I LOVE LITTLE BIG FEETS
Teeth squishy ideas:  Tooth fairy Tooth family Rainbow teeth Giant set of teeth (probably too much work) More of those cute bunny cats  Add arms and make a creature Or… Moriah doesn’t use any and creates her own adorable brilliant idea!!! ❤❤
I love lil big feets
Make a big won plzzz
I would like little big feets if he didn’t have the weird feet
The mouth/teeth squishy looks like a macaron! Think of it like that and its a lot more normal looking lol!
mariahhhh you missed your opportunity to make the teeth into a TACO 😭🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮🌮 maybe this means you just gotta get another pair of dentures and make my OCD wishes & dreams come true! 🤪🫣🤭👹👹🌮  (like dis if you agree) (justice for tacos)
I forgot what channel I was watching and thought she was going to say the tooth looks kinda like an among us dude
Maybe the giant peach can be a james and the giant peach sorta thin?
If ur reading this and are not subscribed, subscribe! She’s almost at 10 mil and she totally deserves it, so help her get there 😊
You should've turned the dentures into a clam squishie. By rounding out the teeth into a smooth shell and then make a little clam creature inside the mouth portion.
you could've made the teeth look like a seashell with a little creature living inside
Now I’m not trying to be gross or anything, but I’m not gunna lie, when I see that giant peach with the hole in the center of the crack, I *immediately* think of a young boy who has taken it upon himself to use it as a “friend”, if u catch my meaning. I just really hope that Moriah has washed and sanitized it… just for safety reasons. 🤢
Shouldve put the teeth in one of the huge squishys and made it creepy cute, (I know thats more of a nerd-e-creafter style but it wouldve been so cool)
you should make the peach into a pumpkin for the fall seasons
What if you used the teeth and one of those giant squishing and made one of those cursed stuffed animals that they always have at the dentist.
Set of teeth in peach like those scary stuffed animals
Moriah: I don't find you that interesting 😐 The new bean body: You will 😌
Oh my gosh I absolutely love the little bean guy and the cat they are SO cute ❤
Moriah James and the GIANT PEACH
yuou could have made the potato a blob
Why not make a tooth into a literal tooth fairy? 🧚🏽‍♀️
I cant stop thinking about if she had put the last teeth squishy in the giant peach😂😂 imagine it because I can see it and it’s hilariously terrifying
I would’ve turned the teeth into a purse or a backpack
PLEASE MAKE THE ALIEN BEAN BODY A PLUSHIE PLEASE
Anual seashell for summer
Should have made a cute tooth with a toothbrush and have it brushing the teeth
I really like Little Big Feets he’s so cute!
Petition to ask Moriah to design a pop it  with each of her characters in each pop
I feel like we need a not Friday video just explaining nafoulafouguess (??????) lore and food and characters
this might be my favorite bean body ever!!!
The chocolate ppl!!! I needs a family of them!!
Lil bigfeets is my new favorite character 😂
If you ever do more teeth squishies, the lower part of the squishie kinda looks like stubby feet, so you could always use some *cough* helpful donors *cough* to make a little blob with feet!
Lil' Big Feets 😍🥰
7:40 lil big feets is my new best friend and favorite character.
❤I've been watching you for 3 years I will never get bored of your content You are amazing i hope you and your family are doing well
I immediately thought to put the teeth inside the peach like the peach is a face😂😂
Tbh, might have been fun to add some big 'ol spheres to the top of the mouth one to make eyes!
for the feet ones you should make little keychains for your kids that show your kid’s personality that would be so cute <3
When doing the dentures you should have made the teeth smooth and made it in to a dessert sandwich
Maybe for if you ever do the velvet ones you could wear gloves before painting them. Maybe the paint or a glue could hold the fibers down for a smoother appearance?
I think lil big feets is actually my favorite alien beanbody yet
Make it into a stuffie
If you turn the denchers the right way it looks like a taco with rainbow filling and wiped cream
What if you connect all the tooth squishies and make a hole jaw lol that would be cool
Would love to see you do this again! My first thought way back when you first got a tooth squishy was to do a “sweet tooth” concept, like it’s just a tooth (maybe with a face?) that has a bunch of frosting, sprinkles etc.
Pls make little bug feets a plushie.
Moriah painting dentures was not what I expected on my 2023 bingo
I love little big feetsss!
The tooth was a amugus
Omg with the mouth she could have glued a squishy that was candy 🍬 shaped like it was biting into it. Still really cool tho. ALSO it would be AWESOME if she painted all THREE of the giant unicorns and made them a set.
I think turning all the teeth into a kitty/bunny/thing family/group/sect would be a fun idea!
Please cut open the peach and place the teeth inside, add feet, etc.
The peach would be a cute pumpkin for a Halloween episode
I know Moriah said she didn’t like little big feets that much, but I think he’s adorable 🥰
I like the dentures lol
Cut off the bottom of the teeth and turn them into feet and arms for blob squishies maybe?
Where is the cat tail??
Name ur baby Zoe or kaylee
Love your videos❤ But for the dentures you could’ve made it a clam 😅
Missed opportunity to make the potato guy a blob. Still, very good makeovers👌
I love the cat
YOU COULDVE DONE AN ANIMAL IN A SEASHELL 😭😭
What if you made the giant peach into a globe of Nofalofagus (sorry if I spelled it wrong). It would be really cool to see what their world looked like.
Little Big Feets plushie when??
Please🙏 do one of thee unicorn
if moriah ever wants to redo the mouth squishy I think it would be a good idea to glue on top half of an oval-shaped swuisy/foam. she could have made the mouth the jaw of a t-rex or something cool like that. Derp with dentures maybe haha?
i love little big feetsss!
ok maybe Moriah should paint on her biggest squishy.
He’s not big feetsss he’s blue feetzz yes it’s spelt that way  I came back to the video after typing and his name it little big feetssss  Am I at the end now and i just have to say little big feets looks as if he needs to wattle to get around 🥹
Moriah I’ve been watching you since middle school and I just moved into college today! Thank you for being such a great part of my life❤
day 11 of asking you to decorate a clock
i have a squishy want to send it is a big panda hoe do i send it? :D
she forgot the sprinke song
Please paint a doll house for mini me and miner me🙏🤞❤️❤️
I think you couldve made the dentures into a taco but it wouldve been a stretch
Y'all she is back and I don't mean this in the way she's back from giving birth cuz that was a while ago but I mean something about her had changed but she's back
Should’ve made the mouth with a cookie in it
THE SPRINKILL'S SONG !😡
I loved the bunny! but maybe a tooth fairy😅 add Wings to the tooth
Id love to see a part 2 of this :3
I mean there is a CLEAR winner
THE MOUTH COULDVE BEEN THE DESSERT TACO AS A SQUISHIE!!!!!
little big feets is adorable!
can you pls customise a dolls house?
Love 💘 it
I thought she was going to put the feet on the mouth, make it one of those hopping teeth toys
The teeth look like standing blobs
When Moriah showed the chocolate bar squishies, the first idea that popped in my head was candy/chocolate themed to previous characters.
I think the toothy cat would be such a cute Halloween plushie
Big feets 🥰🥰
That mouth needs a gold tooth 😂😂😂
Bruh you could make the mouth into a s’more desert!😂❤
I have an idea if you have any more sets of teth you could have made it biting a donut or one of your characters ❤
You could have made the teeth have braces
after you recognized gudetama, i can finally forgive you for the cinnamoroll incident. /j
She didn’t trim the edges😱
this was very entertaining, i love ur videos, Moriah!!<33333 ❤🧡💛💚💙💜 i hope to see u do more of these videos in the futureee~
Lets make this a comment bomb The annual easter video !!!
Cut out a whole in the peach, put the teeth set/denters in the hole, put feet on it and a tail
We need more of this video
You could Actually use the teeth and and the feet and make more Bean bodies as the teeth could be the body and you add feet to it
I like little big feets-
Taste the rainbow 🌈 😅
PLS SEE THIS!!!  With the teeth I think u should gather the teeth army and put braces on them (the colour could be related to your characters)
Missed opportunity to call little big feels big grippers
The mouth could’ve been a clam
The cat made from the tooth is my fav! You could’ve made the dentures into a clam opening with a cute clam peeking from the inside
I thought you would put like another donut squishy or something in the mouth
That mouth squishy could use some added feet
My idea would have been to attach a bunch of teeth and make braces on them 😅 but you didn't like that oops
I was really hoping she was going to attach the teeth to the giant unicorn and just make it a unicorn with a massive mouth 🦄
I’m actually obsessed with the cat, you simply must do the other teeth with different types of cats.
Please paint one of the huge unicorn squishies!
You look pregnant 🤨
U could add Googly eyes to the teeth
I have a calico cat and now when I look at her I just keep picturing sprinkles and caramel on her Lil patches and it's so freaking cute. Thank you for making my brain see that now, it is a blessing not a curse. So so cute lol
Moriah should make a "sweet tooth".  It's a dessert tooth.  Kinda like what you did, just without the animal.  I think it would be funny but just your style
got teeth you could do a “sweet tooth” and play on that term!
I think the last one is a desert with rainbow marshamelo and frosting
you could of made the mouth into a cake monster
“Do you know who this is?”  Me: Mr. Potato Head “No! This is an alien bean body.”
The tooth could also be turned into "tooth fairy"!
Trim a tooth into an amongus
Moriah!!! WHERE IS THE SPRINKLE SONG!!!😂😂😂
you could put a little face in the inside of the mouth squishy so it'd be like a little teeth clam creature
CN you do a twenty 4 hours challenge in your new art room
I can imaging the full set of teeth squishy as a stage scene… the teeth are red stage curtains maybe paint the gums black, then tiny versions of Moriah’s characters doing a performance in the middle section 😀
for the feet squishies, i think if you cut the toes off they would make a cute pair of floppy dog ears! love the what moriah did though with the feet squishies!
You should start a line of tooth cats! Take one of your other cat animals that you have created, and make it as a tooth!
I love that you flipped the tooth and made the cutest cat! A whole family of tooth cats would be amazing. ❤️ 🦷 😺
I would’ve given the dentures vampire fangs
Little big feet's looks like a fall guys shaped character.
I was just WAITING for the tooth to be turned into an Among Us crew member
Moriah you should create an army of teeth turned into cats, the tooth with the crown should be the queen/king
I kinda love the rainbow dentures a lot actually and why did I actually wanna see you use all of the teeth squishes and connect them with braces 😂just a thought, I think it might be cool
MORIAH U SHOULDVE GAVE THE FEET TO THE SMALL FOOTED CHICKEN FAMILY DAD HYGUFIGVHOKDNDJDNEJD
When Moriah first added the feet, 4:48 in the video, I thought she should turn it into Mr.Potato Head
i need more of the tooth bunnies/kitties line!! maybe diff breed of cats?? 🥺🥺🥺🥹 that'd be soooo adorable!!
The chocolate people are actually Shopkins!
We are going to need more parts for sure!❤ thanks Moriah!😂😊
She always makes me smile, even on my tough days. We love you so much Moriah!!
I loved the narwhal and mermaid-cat.
I’m in love with the bean bodies, you should make like mystery boxes of little bean bodies and start a collection like shopkins THAT WOULD BE SO CUTE
Ooh that shouldn't be a Gudetama - that's a potato 🥔 I believe. Also I like the pink gums with rainbow filling; I call it: "tasting the rainbow."😊😊😊
I FREAKING LOVE LIL BIG FOOTS 🦶😭ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
i put my hand up and u said put your hand down
I love a frankin squishy moment
this epidode proves rainbows dont fix everything 😔
Moriah should make a  calendar with her characters on each month or day.
Hi
Idea for beanbody name with the feet: Tootsie Idea for a future tooth squishy: a sweet tooth, maybe with little candies and sprinkles etc. The teeth set squish reminds me of the end of monsters Inc, if you know you know. ❤
Ur the best YouTuber
I love lil big feets
I would've tried to turn the teeth/mouth into a macaroon type desert. The teeth made me think of the crispy, kinda scalloped edge of a macaroon.
I don't think you'd ever do this idea to the mouth of teeth because it would be, creepy, but I would've secured the top half an an animal squishy above it, the the bottom half to the bottom of the jaw. Then I would cut open the middle fleshy part where the tongue was, and probably make a big 'ol tongue just hangin' out. So it would be, a creature, with a GIANT mouth in the middle of it's torso. That may be too unhinged for your pallet of art taste, but as a person who likes monsters that would've been my idea. Who knows though, maybe if you try it you can make it cute, like if the teeth were biting a big cake, or burger or something.
Make one of the teeth a Fresno Night Crawler!
That big unicorn keeps getting click baited 😭 need to see it have a makeover
This was so funny and the bunny is so cute. But it’s really funny to me that I happened to be watching the last two while brushing my teeth.
i was so waiting for her to paint it like those teeth lollies lol
Moriah is ✨wonderful✨
I could kinda see the set of teeth getting turned into like, a cream puff kind of pastry tbh I'm surprised you didn't do that
U should do the teeth has the lil animal characters from my neighbor totoro
I wonder if you could have put the set of teeth into the giant peach and made it look cute??
Moria should draw/paint/sculpt dragons that gird things like rainbows,deserts,and sprinkles 🐉
Nice squishies ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
Hey Moriah, I've watched your content for a long time and I have an idea for your 2nd daughter's  nursery, Maybe you can paint all or your most popular squishes/project onto one if your walls, Just an idea, Have a great day🤍
The first one could’ve been big foot 😂 👣 ••• She did 😂^^ and i like little big feet’s he’d be a cute stuffy ••• She could’ve made a “tooth” fairy  🤔 ••• A gumball or Nahfalogian berries would’ve been cool in the teeth/dentures
"Idk why I'm smiling" same girl
The only thing I can think to do with the teeth is put them in the gaint peach squishy. I'm not sure it would work but its all i could think of
The tooth could of been a tooth fairy
you should make this into a series!!
I'm calling it that the dentures are going to be the least favorite on the end of year list!  Oh she did too 😂
Moriah you to make over a body part doner
Stop talking Moriah, your bean bodies inspire us.
little big feet is so cuteeee 😍
Unpopular opinion- the 3rd one was the best!! It looks sooo satisfying when you squish it!!
Turn a peach into jerry the cherryyyyyyy
can you make a calendar with a character as each month??? please 🩷🫶
I for sure thought Moriah was going to make the teeth a dessert taco, and then she made them… teeth lol, cute though!
You could insert the teeth into the peach and add feet and ears and stuff and get a nyan cat vibe
🥚🥚🥚🥚
Just thought you can turn the giant peach squishy into a giant pastel pumpkin squishy for Halloween.
GUTITAMA!!!!!!
Why the feet on the cute bloby guy?! You couldve made a new blob or a blob but i guess its a lil cute, also how do you make everything cute even though they start out so weird even the FEET, kind of
In Hawaii there are legends of lil big feets but they are called Mini Huunies (Hoo-neez). I don't think that's how you spell it so I'm sorry people who are from Hawaii.
Those teeth, if you cut out the back of it, and then you can turn into a Macaron
Hey who remembers zippy the alien been body
My kids said that you should turn a tooth squishy into a totoro!
Hii
Where was the sprinkle song? 😢
That cat tooth squishy is named sweet tooth 100%, if you disagree come fight me 🥰
I need to know where to get the giant peach 🍑 squishy 😢
Do more of squishy that your mostly likely your not going to paint
You should put a squishy in the mouth and trying to brush the teeth of something.
Giant peach= Jerry the Cherry!!! 🍒
I love ur channel but next time keep the tooth a tooth
CAN YOU PLEASE SELL YOUR CESS SET!!!!! I NEEEEEEEEEEEEED IT!
lITtLe BiG FeEt!!!!!😆
So are we not gonna talk about the fact she made mr. Potato Head
I thought for sure the teeth were going to end up being a dessert taco. 🌮🍰
Honestly more teeth cats or bunnies. its really cute!
Here me out, but making the dentures into a clam or a kinda of ice cream cake falling!!
She should’ve made pusheen the cat with the tooth the shape was perfect 😭
Little Big Feet’s is my all time fav Nufulogian and also you should repaint the mouth squishie into a sandwich!! I think it has the perfect outline for it! 💕 Overall I loved these!
Put the teeth upside down and make a cat or soemthing, to me it looked kinda cute (just finished watching the vid and never mind lol)
I have been watching Moriah from when she has 1mil subs  I’m so proud of you moriah you have come so far 🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
Moriah you should turn the giant peach into Jerry the cherry because he has a butt crack🍑🍒
Omg! That tooth would have made the perfect French bulldog face! Like, the bottom looks like the lips under the nose and the roots the ears!
Stop, I love Little big feets 😭
Congrats on your baby! Hope all is well
are you going to do another Q&A
“i think it’s gudetama!”  me in the corner crying: *it- it’s not gudetama* *its actually tayto potato-* continues crying:
you could've added feet to the set of teeth and made chattery teeth, that could be an idea if you get another one of those squishies.
Pls do the giant squishes  please
CLAY/ SQUISHY
The teeth squishy could be based on skittles "Taste the 🌈  " 😅
You did so good moriah
If you flipped the teeth upright, it kind of looks like a purse.... maybe you could do something with that
With all the teeth do a sweet tooth episode!!!
When I saw the tooth I thought its a shape of the among us character.  As for the set of teeth idk if you could have made it look like a stuffed macaroon if you shaped the teeth down a bit? Idk but still great job on the tough projects and preservering through.
its funny because i have one of those pink shopkin chocolate squishies and i was debaiting sending them 😂
I love Lil Big Feets so much
Moriah I am your biggest fan, can you paint on a backpack please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Put the teeth in the peach and *bam* new blob monster
Just cut a hole in the giant peach and put the teeth inside (I just started squishy roasting)
Make a foot bouquet
7:48 Yeah, let’s hope they’re not making squishes out of body parts
Your the tooth fairy 😂
Moriah should make the squishy ghost as a squishy for Halloween or just for fun
For the teeth, you could cut out the middle and stick little squishes in there. Add some red paint and you got little squishy lunch :)
I was hoping she’d turn the dentures into like a desert taco because on it’s side it’s kind of the right shape!
Little Big Feets gets a little BIG THUMBS UP!  Love him so much, here's hoping he becomes a plush ❤
I'm sopost to be sleeping rn and I don't want to bc your videos are way to good
It’s not a bunny or a cat…. ITS BATMAN 🦇 👨
❤❤❤
Moriah:  little big feets Me: still laughing at the end of the video
don't forget to paint the seashells
7 hours ago that's crazy
Don’t get me wrong I love Moriah, but her calling the bunny a cat just annoyed me
I like when she paints on the tooth squishy
Can you please do a video with every single meme you have created??? Please please please please please 🙏🙏🥺🥺🥺
She really said taste the rainbow😂❤
Her: do you know who this is.. Me: ITS MR.POTATO HEAD Her: its an alien bean-body Me: oh
Okay, I watched this with my sister on her acc.   **SEASHELL PAINTING!  Please copy and paste. Lets make another comment bomb**
This is a video I have been wanting and waiting for!! So awesome. Fav squish was the kitty! I have an idea, it's been a while since you have done a squishy makeover that the wheel chooses. You should put on the wheel "the avoidance squishies" with the other bins (aka fruits, animals, hopeless, etc) and see what happens. I think it would be fun to see what chance brings.
Moriah should take one item from each of her categories that she is avoiding and make one big project
The feet creation kinda remind me of the Narnia movie that had the invisible feet human creatures
The peach can be a naphaphgols fruit
Moriah should turn the giant peach into a nafalogian berry!!!
Should of made a cute little bloby clam creature using the dentures as it's shell 😆
If you still get leftover teeth, then you need to make a mouth king with the full set of teeth and then a teeth army with the baby teeth
I had spammed your early videos when you started getting feet. Sunrise and sunset scenes. "I'm walking on sunshine"
his name should be meep
A bean bodies blind box would be so cool!!!
YOU DIDN'T DO TYE SPRINKLE SONG👹👹👹
I love this! I was thinking you shouldve made a taco with the mouth! either a dessert taco or just a regular one!
i comment and like on every new vid of urs but  u never heart or comment my comment 😅☹ I'm a 9 year old girl  1. the legend says that Moriah never fails to entertain us 😅❤ 2. I was having a rough day but Moriah made my day ❤😅 actually I wasn't having a rough day but I wanted to appreciate u 😅❤
If u turned the theeth like kinda like a  taco and put drizzle on the out side of the gum it could maybe look like at strawberry taco shell and the white part of the theeth could be frosting and the inside rainbow ice cream
I love little big feet. How can you not? He’s so cute.
Where did you get that potato squishy?
FINANCIAL is getting on
for the weird teeth ones i woulda made it into some sort of shell fish, still love the designs! so cute
Not to be that person but U could’ve made the ugly mouth squishy into a cream puff
I absolutely love the first squishy you did. I’m so glad there’s a new Bean body blob.
imagine if you took the teeth squishies and made a garland out of them but the string is braces and the braces are also attached to the teeth of course
Question moriah how is mini mini me?
Please do a part 2❤
It would be so cute a set of teeth turned into a set o animals like bunnies or foxes because the cat is so freking adorable! ♥♥♥ Amazing job ♥♥♥
11:13 I thought she was going to turn that mouth into a hamburger, it kinda looked like that in my opinion
moriah your my favorite
I feel like Lil' Big Feets is responsible for when you're walking in the woods and hear a step behind you, but there's nothing there.
You should have made the mouth a clam
I wish it had bracessss the last one
I think that the mouth with teeth could be cute for a Halloween decoration!
Guaran-TEETH
you have been my favorite youtuber for 3 years
I was here a second ago and there were. Two new ones now there's like ten
For a moment I thought Moriah would make a pearl in a clam design with the dentures but I can understand being stumped on an idea when the entire thing looks like it can't be anything else than what it is 👄it's haunting. Great video as always! Love the idea of flipping a tooth and welcome the new bean body to the family!
Today is my birthday
Okay so does anyone remember/know gossamer from the looney tunes?   That's what I was thinking for one of the teeth
The teeth remind me of a taco 🌮
Don’t forget annual seashell painting vid!!!!
hi sorry I'm late heh I was driving to the beach! LOVE YOUR VIDS MORIAH!!!!! ❤❤❤❤
Little big feets is now one of my favorites
Little big feet it’s so cute though
She could have made the feet into foot prints of caricter
mr potato would actually be perfect for those feet!!!
Thats tayto
Make the teeth into bunnies, or cats i think it would be cute
I'm 2 mins in and I so want to put that mouth of teeth and put them in the peach!!
the squishy with feet so funny to me 😭
The denture teeth squishy could have been like they are chewing rainbow bubble gum and you can blackout some spots so to looks more gooey and sticky lookin. 💕☺️
Hi
I really like the cat
Lil big feets is my new favourite character
THE FEET ONE MUSCLE CHICKEN CODED BUT OPPOSITE
I love lil big feets! <3 I think he's my new favorite alien bean-body. Props to you Moriah for stepping out of your comfort zone. Its all ways a hard thing to do but you did a great job.
I was hoping you were going to add like braces or tooth gems to the teeth, that would have been fun.
you could have made the teeth into a desert taco
Moriah, you’re basically procrastinating!!!!!
I LOVE LITTLE BIG FEETS!!
For a second I thought she was gonna make a Mr. Potatohead. o.o
Will you show yo7r new baby in the community🎉 congratulations 🎊 😊
You should name the feet one Liaam
All I can think about when I see the feet squishies, is “Feets” from space.
I'm disappointed she didn't turn the dentures into a cake dessert thing. It would've been funny to call it sugar in the shape of teeth.
I CANT BELIEVE SHE DIDNT NAME THE KITTY OR COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF BACKGROUND STORY
Ok hear me out but have Mini You draw a few monsters and see if you can recreate one of them as a Squishie!
whether you nail it or fail it moriah I will love the video
You gotta do more panda Buns
Omg I finally found your channel bc I have not watched your channel in a while
i think the upside down teeth looks like a little totoro
The teeth squishys (it sounds wrong to say that phrase) are used in some dentist offices to show little kids how to properly brush there teeth. As like a demonstration.
I think it would have been interesting if she could have turned the dentures into an open clam with a little smiley face
The dentures one could have made a cute colorful version of that windup children’s toy from long ago! Just needed to create the wind up part with foam!
Moriah should make multiple teeth cats like she does with her bean body alien
She should make the Alien bean bodies as squishies
Moriah is now the tooth fairy. People send her their teeth squishes for content 😁
Just a thought the 2 one she made out of the tooth looked like a character from my neighbour Toronto for a sec
PLEASE DO THE GIANT PEACH I'M DESPERATE  can you make the giant peach a nopagilopolus (I have no idea how to say it) thing maybe add an alien blob
Moriah should attach some sort of animal/creature to put on top of the peach. The peach COULD BECOME NAFALOFAGUS!! Comment bomb “turn the giant peach into Nafalofagus!!!!
early
Bunny’s name should be binkles
Make the mouth into Halloween and give it to nerdEcrafter Do you have a spider to come out of its mouth I know it will be hard for you but I think you can still make it funny
Hi Moriah, can you put the set of teeth into the giant peach?
What happened to opie?
I feel like U could actually do the feet but have Ur baby's names on them in a pastel colour (different for each baby) and have coloured toes that match. I think that could be cute?
Moriah all your creations are so cute and unique I love watching your videos 🥰
Is it just me or she could use the teeth to build the totoro family from studio ghibli
Can you pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese  dtaw on your table
Let v u n ur content moriah❤
Just an idea how about making the teeth into a “sweet tooth” collection kind of thing?
you should make all the teeth into little cats they're so cute 😭
Like how did she turn an ugly tooth into an adorable cat like HOW
You have made a night mate for  me buddy
You could put the teeth into the peach and give the peach eyes and a nose
BIG 👏 FEETS 👏 NEEDS 👏 TOENAILS 👏  Edit: I also would've given the teeth braces
ummm i actually like the last denture squishy bc it was cool n weird!!
The dentures screamed TACOS
The set of teeth you could have made into a clam or something else
The teeth are chewing bubble gum and the tooth could be a tooth fairy
How did moriah become a high school student and then this massive outstanding YouTuber I’m just here to say I think you so talented!! I love you moriah!!!❤❤❤
MORIAH WHERE IS THE SPRINKLE SONG PLEASE PLAY IT!!
Hear me out if she does the dentures again she could make it into a dessert
The teeth could be made into “sweet teeth” designed as characters for specific candies or sweets. Popped into my head so thought I’d share! 🖤
Teeth can be flipped upside down and made into odd bunnies. Odd bunny family
You should have made the set of teeth eating a donut or cookie. Like cut open the middle and put a dessert in the mouth
You've got to do a part 2!
I really want moriah to do the big pig with wings squishy
LITTLE BIG FEET IS THE CUTEST!!! 🥹🥹🥹
PLEASE DO ONE OF THE JUMBOS COPY AND PASTE
I thought she was gonna turn the dentures into a sort of dessert panini/sandwich... The tooth cat was a surprise though
You couldve changed the teeth one into a cave scene from the bean blob planet. And changed up teeth shaped to stones. Sorry I really can't spell the name of the planet.
So that's what happens when you eat too many Skittles!  In all seriousness the blending of that vibrant rainbow is 😘👌  The kitty is adorable too... I guess you could say he has (is?) a sweet tooth. Love as always!  ❤️🧡💛💚🩵💙💜
The but crack 4eminded me of a blob❤😊
wait what if all the bean bodies think lil big feet is huge but thats just a myth
Can u please make the den hers have rainbow teeth instead of the inside
Lil Big Featsss is my favorite squishy ever made.
Just make an army of teeth
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SPRINKLE SONG😢
Okay but if she named the Calico Cat Sweet Tooth~? I feel like that'd be an adorable homage to the original squishy💖
can you do the giant peach squishie it is so cute
How about a tooth fairy and her pile of teeth
THE BEAN BODY 😭
Little big feets is my favorite bean body ever
She should have made the mouth in to a taco!
the tooth cat thing reminded me of little white Totoro
The Desert Calico Cat is so cute! I want a plush of it so bad!
Omg congrats on achieving 😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉
YOU FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG!!!!!
The teeth filled mouth could have become an open clam maybe.
Do a big one, please!!!
with the peach you should make jumbo chups
no sprinkle song? 🥺 I loved this video! little big feets is so cuteeee
🤫 the set of teeth is my favorite 💀
@MoriahElizabeth I was thinking of rainbow for a set of teeth. And you could make them have a coordinating brace color on each one. But the braces could actually be a security stuffed animal that they hold close to the front of the body.  It would just look like braces as a set.
I would have made a sweet tooth and cary it around and the next time someone asked me if I brought my sweet tooth I’d pull it out 😁🦷
i loooove the tooth kitty!! id love to see more of them like cats/bunnies/squirrels?
I was thinking of it being a oyster for the mouth but still a glow up!
SHE COULD HAVE MADE A TACO-LOOKING ICE CREAM SANDWICH WITH THE MOUTH ONEEEEEEE
If it were me, I would've made rainbow braces for the teeth, and because I'm lazy I would've made that weird inner part black lol.
The fact that I love the velvet squishes- 😢
YOU MISSED THE SPRINKLE SONGGGGGGGGGGGGGG😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
do a candy corn bean body
Could have turned the teeth into a handbag! ^^;
Love the squishes❤️  BUT YOU FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG
Wow.
I love moriah's videos
I Love them❤
Who thinks moriah should do a calendar with a character and put it in her art room? Like if you agree. 😊
As someone who loves your videos and is a dental hygiene student, I really love your set of squishy teeth lol!❤❤😊
no sprinkle song!?
BUNNY I WAS ALSO THINKING BUNNY WHEN UPSIDE DOWN I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD SAY IT LOOKS LIKE THAT WHEN UPSIDE DOWN 8:32 ALSO AGAIN AT 10:46 SHE READ MY MIND
Chocolate Bar people are so cute! Good opportunity for you to create your own kind of candy bar!❤❤ Maybe Character themed Candy Bars?
3:12 THAT IS NOT GOUDITAMA THAT IS TATO POTATO AND ITS OVER EXPENSIVE AND FROM SMOKO PLS IVE BEEN WANTING IT 😭😭😭
Bean body pre gesso was giving POTATO HEAD 🥔
Omg can we be honest rq ? SLAYYYYYY
I love the first 2 so much, such cute characters!
I feel like the teeth could have had matching rainbow braces, but maybe that's too much work for a squishy that's still weird at the end of the day. lol
I love moriah
My main thought for the mouth was to put it in a giant squishy for a big huge smile 😂😂😂 but I love the kitty and new alien bean body!!
finally someone else who realizes upside down teeth are cats
I love Lil Big Feets!! ❤❤❤
A rainbow mouth!!!
The shape of upside-down tooth made me think of the little Totoro's from My Neighbor Totowa 😊
You should’ve put braceis on the set of teeth
We HAVE TO make this a series
Can you name the bean body potaTOES?
Why does she keep forgetting the sprinkle song?
PAINT THE TOE NAILS PLEASEEEEEEE
Okay but what if you could turn the dentures into something clam like?😂 Would probably crave more work with the scissors, but just paint a rainbow on it and bang! No more teeth! ❤
Rainbow grill cheese is real
You should make the giant peach a nofalogian berry (not quite sure how to spell that) Luv ur vids❤
Can you PLEASE turn the cat into a bunny and name he sweet buns¡
That's Tayto the Potato by Smoko. He has a whole line of merch. Definitely not Gudetama lol
I am my dad’s daughter and I always watch Mariah’s videos she’s my favorite YouTuber
YAY
You should make a custom guess who game
You should make a custom guess who game
You should make a custom guess who game
Love the Squishy makeovers! FYI, the potato squishy is Tayto the Potato and he’s a couch potato from SMOKO!
You should make a custom guess who game
You should make a custom guess who game
SHE DID NOT DO THE SPRINKLE SONGGGG 9:08
You should make a custom guess who game
The cat is SOOO CUTE!!!!!!!!!😊
Sorry if I’m starting a comment bomb here, but it would be so cool for Christmas if you made a Christmas tree set! The ornaments could be painted with your characters, or fun little thing that have to do with characters, like Lemon’s bow, or like Derp’s burger. If you like this idea copy+paste so that it catches on in time for Christmas!!
Personally I’m ok with Moriah never customizing feet or teeth squishes. But she can do whatever she wants
I actually like all three of them😳
When you turn the tooth upside down it looks like Totoro from the Studio Ghibli Movie
I actually think the alien is really cute.
MORIAH you NEEEEEEDDD to make big feet’s a stuffed animal! PLEASSEEEE!! I am a HUGED fan
Actually, that squishy you guessed might be gutatama is a character named Tayto Potato and he’s owned by (as far as I’m aware) the brand Smoko. He’s a graphic merchandise character like hello kitty, just way more obscure.
Hii srry im late!!😅😅😅
We need more of the teeth cat bunnies!
Honestly so suprised you didn't make the tooth into a "sweet tooth" with deserts on it or something.  The bunny was cute tho!
You know, you could take the giant peach and make it into a jack-o-lantern for Halloween. It would be really cute and you wouldn’t I e to deal with it rotting
Moriah, I'm sorry. 😢
Hey moriah congrats on your daughter. I love your content! For your next squishy makeover you should do the robot and make a rainbow moriah robot
This was posted when I was in school
I loved this video very creative, loved all your creations 🤍🤍🤍
I was thinking for the dentures you could’ve cut it apart and kind of use the two rows of teeth like the edge of a shell (idk how to explain it lol) so you basically cut it to open wide enough that it’s 90° and maybe stick a cute pearl or animal inside and boom its a clam. I mean it would need much more trimming and it wouldn’t obviously be dentures or wtv it was anymore but yeah if you ever get another one of those it could be an option. Not 100% sure on how it would look tho, if i’m being fr.
I love Moriah❤❤❤🎉
We need a tooth kitty baby!
Petition to have Little Big Feets as the next plushie 👇
A"tooth" fairy for the teeth?!?
Do a video about the useless bin. Pls I love watching your vids
I can't wait to see how high she ranks these squishies in her Ranking Video
omg why is little big feet so cute love you moriah!! happy friyay!!😂
THE BEAN BODY IS SO CUTE OH MY GOSH❤❤❤
i love you!!!!!!!
Moriah for the teeth instead of the rainbow, try to make it has a taco..?
I wonder if she had her baby yet
I have an idea for the feet. There's a donut shop where in from that sells glazed donuts that are shaped like giant feet the size of your head. They call them Big Feet (ofc) and they come in glazed, chocolate, and chocolate sprinkle! (The donut shop is called Whistle Stop Donuts)
i left the room for luke 5 minutes and i find out she is making MR POTATO HEAD IM DYING LAUGHING 😂😂😂😂
Turn th eteath into a cookie samwitch
4:54 the first one rn is reminding me of that horrible doll thing Arthur got on his show. A poogle or something 😭
I was hoping you'd turn around the tooth and see the bunny Ended up being a cat, but HEY YOU SAW THE BUNNY, THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME  Also, Little Big Feets is adorable
Ok she could have made the mouth as a macaroon
Did anyone else immediately think Mr. potato head when she put the feet with the “potato” lol. 😂😂😂
The giant peach you should make it into the bean body planet ❤😮
The giant peach you should make it into the bean body planet ❤😮
Moriah your awesome at painting and art I don’t know why you keep saying in your vids that your not that good at art and who would be mad at you if you mess up what I’m saying is Moriah your amazing❤❤
Amazing video Moriah!! I loved watching it :)) ❤
Lil big feets is so CUTE 🥰 OMG I WANT HIM AS A PLUSHIE RIGHT NOW 🥹
Teeth upside down could be simple bunnys
The giant peach you should make it into the bean body planet ❤😮
The giant peach you should make it into the bean body planet ❤😮
The tooth upside down reminds me so much of the blue totoro
When you flip the tooth over, it looks like one of those baby Totoro’s from the Ghibli movie.
The giant peach you should make it into the bean body planet ❤😮
You should make a big squishy holding the chocolate
I LOVE lil big feets  he is my spirit animal
I’m mad at her she didn’t play the sprinkles song
She mentioned the end of the year ranking video and I had forgotten about it so not I’m gonna be looking forward to it for 3 1/2 months so that’s something to add to my “random thoughts for 2AM list    No I will not watch the one from 2022. If you thought of that SHAME ON YOU.
OMG I HAVE AN IDEA!!!!! U SHOULD DO AN ALIEN LAND!!!
I love how moriah is so funny but so dark at the same time😂
An idea, paint a apple squishy rainbow then make merch if it😂🍎❤💚💙💜
Maria cool move it into anything else 11:19
7:30 His name should be Feethan
Wdymmm those teeth are just tacos in disguise
i love little big feets that is my son i am adopting him
I think they all came out nice this is the very first video I’ve ever watched of yours, but you could’ve given the teeth some braces or maybe a gold tooth lol
I have an idea for the feet! Please, please, PLEASE make them into a jelly bean family! If they don’t have toes, they will look like jelly beans! Who else agrees?
Again I was a little late because on Fridays I have something called boys and girls club and I'm like gonna be like 5 hours late like every single day maybe 4 if I'm Lucky but mostly it's gonna be 5 hours cause I have something called boys and girls club which is 3 extra hours of from school which have school from 7:00 which is morning boys and girls club and To 3:00 which is the end of school and then I have 3 extra hours till 6:00 but I usually get off at like 540 or 520 something like that and so I'm usually gonna like that 4 hours Or 5 hours late
That is not a bunny or a cat it is totoro from My neighbor totoro
Moriah, you could give the big peach a big mouth and put the teeth in it's mouth. It could be a smiling or singing peach!
She should make the teeth into a Sakura
lm a BANANA
It might've been cool to do a "sweet tooth" design with candy and such
Please name the cat Sweet Tooth. Thank you.
“Oh is this gudetama” “Do you know who this is? Gudetama? No!”
Wait I LOVE little big feets
Why didn’t you do the big squishy’s? You should have combined one of the unicorns with the peach, and then it would be humongous😂
in my opinion you should have turned the mouth into a taco
Moriah please make Pandy Paws from Gabby's Dollhouse with another tooth squishy in your next makeover video.
At one point I thought the first squishy she did was gonna be Mr Potato hehe
ooooh you could do a james and the giant peach themed squishie! Like do a cute pastel version!
JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH!
I think because realistically you used one foot 🦶 🦶 you should have called him big foots hahaha
I have my own bean body alien! (credits to moriah) his name is florp and he’s the king of florpalorp (his planet) and I love him :)
I love you I have been watching you since I was 6 ❤😢 so many memos lol😂😅
Teeth squishies turned into blob squishies
she should put that teeth into the huge peach so make it talking peach
The tooth cat would have been such a cute totoro set!!!❤❤❤
9:07 excuse me!? Where is me sprinkle song D:
Moriah when she’s back to making videos should paint on a dresser but each drawer is a different character on a vending machine, but each snack is based on her characters copy and paste this if you want to see it 👇🏻
The Tooth upside-down looks like a Mini Totoro from the Movie "My Neighbour Totoro" by Hayao Miyazaki (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki?wprov=sfla1) from the Studio Ghibli. This could be an idea for an other Tooth Squishy. A Mini Totoro Family ❤
Teeth family, teeth dressed as a debtist
She should do the same thing except keep the items the same thing. For example tooth to tooth, not tooth to cat.
She should do a video fixing all of the squishy “Body donors”… or scrap them and make a new squishy with all of them
btw the teeth squishies are usually for dental offices for either decor or stress relief for patients :)  11:01 you could also try painting on jewels on some of the teeth
The mouth totally could have been a monster with a big mouth! Like, cut the teeth to look sharp, add a few extra things on the top, bottom, and sides — bam! Monster… thing.
8:37 GUYS ITS TOTORO PLS TELL ME IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO SEES IT
the dentures could have been a fish with big teeth! or a shark. add a fish tail and voila i guess?
Repaint the worst squishies u have
I am actually in love with lil big feets :D <3 plushie?
I love the marshmallow kitty. So cute
Holy smokes, Little Big Feeeeets is my new all-time favorite character of yours! Knocked that one right out of the park, great job! 😍
The lil bean body is so derpy and cute 🤣 like its so weird but it's adorable I want a plush of the lil dude. Put like some baby clown shoes on the lil dude 🤣
The bean body looks like that egg from that one Barney movie
Pls customise your skateboard pls!!
James and the giant peach Tooth fairys
Yeah but can you do it again… Please?
Lil big feet is my favorite 🤩
you know you're hooked when Spectrum tells you your internet is gonna be off for repairs this afternoon and your only concern is that it's back on by 4PM. (It wasn't . . . 🙄🙄)
Love ur videos!
Do the seashells!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have an idea for the teeth squishies. You could do a candy fild teeth like a rotten tooth but rotant of candy. It could be full of color to match your style.🌈
Pt2
Make moreeeeeeeee
I'm glad she finally did something with the feet Squishies cuz I've been stressing since 2016 abt them
The peep style cat is honestly super adorable 🥺 I love him
Tooth outta three isn't bad!
4:59 I’m getting Zoombini vibes from this guys honestly
The teeth squishy that u turned into a cat is so cute 😭😭😭
I think we need to see a tooth cat collection! (repost if your with me) Moriah every time you paint squishies I literally don't understand how people are so talented.
MORIAH! You could have made the teeth a clam😢
She could have turned the denchers into a cream bun? Love you moriah! Also congrats on your baby girl! Have a sweet day ❤
the mouth one could have been made into a clam with smt inside 😍
That rainbow teeth squishy would’ve been great if she was sponsored by skittles, because the squishy taste the rainbow
My kids were gifted tooth squishies when they finished their round of braces
I D E A S 1.tooth: bunnies with the toots as ears and the other side smoothed out 2. The full mouth: trim it and turn it into cake That is all thank you!❤️
Hi
you could have put a character inside the teeth and showed their ears piercing thru the gums
What if she did the sharkboy and lavagirl robot with the teeth... 🤔
The peach could become a pumpkin for Halloween!!
I think muscle chicken need some of those feet!
Oh my gosh, she didn’t make a set of rainbow feet, they were six!
I would have gone for the obvious “sweet tooth” pun but the cat is so much better
Little big feetsss is amazing!!!!
Oh man that mouth that she didn’t like was just BEGGING for some braces!! I think that would have really upped the cute factor with the rainbow.
Please name the teeth skittles! They are tasting the rainbow 🌈 🦷. Also the little teeth can be made into tooth fairies
I would have made the teeth into a taco 🌮
I'm guessing the teeth and feet squishies are mostly from dentists and podiatrists.
Moriah always give me the to idea create something❤
The whole time I was thinking of painting desserts on the teeth to make them a "Sweet Tooth"
Coulda used the teeth as like a Dino hoodie. But just the hoodie and added more on top and bottom. Like a cat body and found the top of the teeth and add lil horns. Cut the teeth to make sharper teeth.
Can she please turn the tooth cat, into a teeth cat... collection??? 🥹
I would have made a tooth into a “sweet tooth”! A tooth shaped cake or sweet. A double cone ice cream maybe? Something silly and weird like that!
Could have cut the denture in the middle and flip it around so the bumps of the teeth are actually frosting? And go from there
the first one is a meme lol
The two critters came out great!  Maybe the other teeth could also be minimalist cats... and the other feet could be used for Lil' Big Feets' family =P
DO A GIANT
DO A GIANT
DO A GIANT
DO A GIANT
Come on I want to see the big boyz part 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
DO A GIANT
Hi
The second I saw those teeth I was like "flip it upside down then you could make a Totoro, rabbit, frog or cat."  I'm surprised she didn't have that idea sooner!    The feet are just bizarre though!
You could have turned the mouth into a piece of cake- HEAR ME OUT- turn it on its side so the teeth are going up and down then if you used puffy paint you could have made the teeth into dollops of icing or whipped cream, and maybe used more puffy paint to add it on the back part ot just chopped that off and put it in the filler/trash squishy bin
Make a rainbow tuth🦷🦷
With the teeth you could’ve cut out that strange middle bit and made it look like a cake
Ok but even with the worst squishy’ s imaginable she still makes it better then before!!!!! Moriah is a god of the squishy’ s!!!!
Are you ever gonna float on another squishy packages video? They are my favorite and you are my favorite YouTuber keep up the great work.❤pls pin ❤
You should do a whole set of teeth/bunny/cat squishies
Guys…MORIAH DIDNT PLAY THE SPRINKLE SONG😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🧁
I love your videos moriah! <3
Tacos came to mind when you was painting the last teeth set. You could of done tacos 😊 🌮
4:55 not going to lie but it reminds me of mr potato head  😅
I LOVE LITTLE BIG FEETS I DIDN'T EXPECT TO LOVE HIM SO MUCH OML IF YOU DON'T MAKE A PLUSH I WILL DO IT MYSELF ISTG
PETITION TO HAVE MORIAH MAKE A CALENDER WITH EVERY MONTH AS ONE OF HER CHARACTERS

RAHHH OMG I LOVE YOU SO MUCH YOUR MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER YOUR SO CREATIVE AND INSPIRING YOU ARE ACTUALLY MY CHILDHOOD NO MATTER WHAT CHALLENGE YOU FACE YOU ALWAYS OVERCOME IT YOUR THE BEST AND AN EVEN BETTER MOM FOR YOUR CHILDREN
Has she had the baby ?
HOW DOES THIS HAVE 2 LIKES (including me) BUT 2.9k COMMENTS AND THIS WAS 4 HOURS AGO LIKE PLEASE LIKE THIS
Omg cheaky chocolate
people that think moriah  should get 1000  mill are allowed to like this comment
I’m doing a face mask while watching this
Love that you faced this fear😭the alien was actually cute also lowkey was thinking u would put a dessert in the mouth one🤷‍♀️
She should name the Carmel Chocolate cat, Chacarmel
I love your videos I used to watch you with my cousin ❤
I KNEW YOU WERE GUNNA DO THAT WITH THE DENTURES
Me, a former shopkins fan: (screams internally)
I love what you did with that tooth 😊
It's like a candy corn blue for some weird reason
The denture should have been a taco.
Did anyone else think she was gonna make the teeth into a hamburger character with teeth?
Me when I saw the jaw : OH HAIL MOUTH CLOUD
I’ve been watching your videos for years. My daughter who is going to be 5 started watching one. She loves art and is now hooked on your videos because they “teach her new stuff with art.”
Cut a hole in the giant peach and put the mouth squishy inside.
That potato.. Egg.. Gudetama thing is really cute actually
i feel like we need a little big feets plushie
Love the cat ! so cute. But.. he seem lonely. he need more friends like him ! MAybe other cute cat desserts ? or other cute animals ? (bunny, fox, dog...)
Big question....what happen to your cat?? Is he still alive?
At 5:34 minutes in the video, the alien bean body looks like Mr. Potato Head 🥔😂
can I get a three cheers for moriah? She takes care of her NEW BORN DAUGHTER and TODDLER, the two hardest ages, and still posts consistently EVERY friday.
Wait i minute she forgot the sprinkle song
OMG I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT CAT BUT ITS ADORABLE!❤
yay new vid! Girl, you're on TRENDING!
you should sometime make lime or even citrus as squishes or you should customize crocs
Ooh the teeth upside down shape reminds me or my friendly neighbour totoro
My birthday is tomorrow ( Sep 16)
I absolutely love the alien beanbody! it's soooo cute!! Moriah, thank you so much for posting every week while managing two children.
Is anyone going to talk about the fact that Moriah still hasn’t done her yearly seashell video (hint hint please do it)
idk what to say just let me say so,ething
I literally love lil big feets so much for no reason
You could put the giant mouth you made inside the giant peach and then turn the peach part into a face. So It's no longer a peach, but like a grandpa with dentures. IDK. But at the beginning that is what I thought you were going to do.
I thought of doing a “sweet tooth” for the tooth squishy like something dessert themed
For the teeth one, you could redo your redo and make it an ice cream sandwich or some kind of dessert sandwich.
omg I LOVE the tooth cat, what a great transformation! I would buy that one if given the chance 😄
If Moriah likes this comment I'll throw my phone of happiness
Moriah You know you could’ve made the dentures into the macaron and in the inside it will have a little face but instead you made  dentures again but the gums are lighter and there’s rainbow inside and I respect that is a great idea for the cat actually ps: I love your cat idea. To be honest with you if I would choose a squishy artist it would be you🧁🍬🌈
The fact you could have made it like a macaroon and teeth as cream inside as a little creature
Hiiii❤ can I get a shoutout:)?
love these little guys
Nearly at ten mill subs congrats!
Where was the sprinkle song 😭😭
She definitely has used the chocolate before it was in the video where she combined 3 squishys and it was the bear the drink and the chocolate
You could always add a cookie or food squishy to the teeth so it looks like they are taking a bite out of them...though it would still look odd lol
OMG THE SET OF TEETH YOU SHOULD OF CUT THE SIDE THAT WAS FLAT AND TURNED INTO A MACAROON WITH WHIP CREAM THAT WAS CROOKED😂😂😂😂
𝕐𝔼𝕊!!!!
I think you could have made the dentures into teeth biting into a donut! Maybe you could do it if you ever get that squishy again. Btw the cat squishy was so fricking cute?!
You should do another "fixing things ive ruined" with the Bill hat!
just a thought but if you ever do the teeth and feet again you could put them together and make the look a bit like amoung us  characters, but make it your own old or new  characters in space/scuba uniforms.
We need a part two ! Great video
I was hoping for the teeth in mouth squishy being being turned into one of those chatter boxes with the big feet on the bottom and an army of dessert bunnies and kittens.  But the alien bean body is adorable.
Are the Alien bean body’s gonna take over the Blob army???
for the teeth you should have put eyes on it like those ones you wind up idkk
…why does 4:49 look like Mr. Potatohead…
Like i know it after the fact and all but upside down teeth could be made into bunnies... well i am dumb. Should have watch the rest of the video before commenting hahahaha...
Can we get merch of the "Rainbow Grilled Cheese Dentures" pretty pretty please with A cherry on top :] It's my favorite character 😭
She should’ve made the teeth into a macron!! 😩
If anyone goes and makes an actual alien bean body using Moriah's (hilarious and amazing) instructions I wish to be informed so I can shower them with love from a less-artistic person. Thank you and LOVE YOU MORIAH❤
Little big feetsss is my absolute favorite
I mean, it’s name is desertion
the mouth squishy feels like an alternate reality skittles logo... ya know, taste the rainbow
It’s name is deserts
Really cute designs, but I'm sad we didn't get literal tooth fairies. Imagine putting wings on them and little faces.
I thought that the bean body dude was gonna be a knock off of a mister potato head but with feet instead of a pair of shoes 😅 lol  9:01 oh my gawd upside down tooth squishies can also be Totoro!!! 😮🩷 you Moriah!! 😊🩷
U KNOW GUTATAMA
The mouth should be called taste the rainbow 🌈
You changed since I last saw you
Hi!
for the teeth squishies, my first thought were those little bunny spirits from totoro. maybe you could do something with that?
When I saw the teeth my first thoughts were ‘oh you could make a sweet tooth!’ like a tooth with a chocolate sauce and sprinkles on it! Or that it looked like the smaller totoro’s!
Could totally put luscious lips around the teeth... do a Miley Cyrus mouth 😆
Oogly boogly shnoogly doogly roses are red violets are blue I a dancer is a ballerina I have a friend named Latina babina 👁👄👁
YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA IM ONLY 4 hours LATEEEE
Love the creativity! I have an idea for the other teeth…it could be painted like cute desserts and be then would be a sweet tooth 😂
I love little big feets. I can picture it tiny running around.
i wish she could paint all of her teeth squishies
Add tooth gems to the dentures!
Moriah makes every day better!
Do you have any pumpkin squishies for Halloween? I would love to see a pastel rainbow cat pumpkin.
The teeth ones can be bunnies
The last one is the definition of taste the rainbow.
The kitty was tooo cute!!!  um.. the other ones can go pound sand.. Great job on the video though!  Hope you and the lil ones are doing well
It could be a bean body /Squirrel And a cat from Nafalofagagous
That potato squishy is adorable. Moriah makes entertaining videos. I love watching them.
SHE FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG (love her so much tho she NEVER gets old <3)
You should put your baby’s footprint on a foot squishy! I don’t know how big your baby is, but if you have more feet squishies that could work!
Adorable… you should of made your big foot bean have rainbow feet so everywhere they walk they bring the rainbow… lol 😂
The bean body looks like mr potato head but      ME-affied
Do a dessert tooth squishy named sweet tooth🥰
Pls pt 2
Love them! Can you make a part 2 please? It’s fun watching you do it!
I wonder if Moriah has had her new daughter?
I think the teeth is my favorite one I love the rainbow.
WHY NO SPRINKLE SONG??!?!?!?!?!?!?
You should’ve made the teeth with rainbow braces that would be a cute touch ✨
Quinten Torantino would love this video  No i will not elaborate
You should ad rainbow braces to the dentures
11:21 Fredtricks needs is a whole little family ❤ ) totally not a request (lol
Flip the teeth over and add feet for bunny blobs!!!
cat is trans confirmed
this is my favorite bean body so far.
Those are really cute! I love the new alien bean body <3
Am i the only one who would looooove mystery boxes for the alien bean bodies?
That cat is so adorable though
As an SLP that teeth set squishy is oddly attractive 😂 sorry not sorry. :/
Where is Opie? Where did he go?😢
moriah u should make a sweet tooth
the teeth flipped upside down also reminds me of the baby totoros from my neighbor totoro and i really thought you were gonna do that
So proud of you for facing your fears! Thank you for a fun video. 😊
Omg yes I’ve been recomindg the tooth for so long liek a rainbow tooth or a cavity
Day 6 of asking make a dollhouse with your characters as dolls
You should make a squishy of Megan and you should become   Megen
Love the Bigfoot one he turned out sooooo cute. What kind of paint do you use on them?
I want to see the baby please Moriah :)
The teeth can be an among.❤🤩❤
coming back to watch ME videos after a long time like when ur grandma makes good soup and you’ve been saving it in the freezer for a while but you heat it up on the stovetop and it’s damn good soup and you call your grandma to tell you you love her and ask for more soup. soup metaphor.
I love how she can just come up with any idea and nail it. Good job Moriah!
The tooth upside down looks like a little Totoro
I’m just so shocked that I’ve been watching Maria Elizabeth for over 18 months I’ve been watching her for like two years. She is my favorite YouTuber.❤😊
You know if you cut the teeth in half it could possibly make for good rabbit ears
With the full row of teeth you should have made a rainbow sandwich with it 😅
I love art so I watch her
I was thinking the bottom of the tooth could be the legs for some creature. With the dentures (this is a realy weird idea) they could have been turned into a dessert. For example a creampuff. The teeth being the cream.   P.S. Thanks for all that you do. You work so hard. And congratulations on your new baby.
You can use a bunch of teeth and make braces
Please do the baby bottle next🍼👶
the teeth are the right shape for being flipped over to make a totoro!
Omg make the tooths  in to among us characters
Little big feet is adorable! 🥰
I would like to recommend for you Maria if you’re reading this use the peach that you found use another part of a squishy to make the bottom pointy and make it into another fruit from nofolofiguis!
THE SPRINKLE SONG 😭 where’d it gooooo! Btw love the video 💗💗
"peep style cat" *shows a pic of a bunny peep after rejecting the idea of making it a bunny* I'm dying 🤣 ilysm Moriah!
you should take one of the teeth and make a sweet tooth! like rainbow with candy and stuff! the squad who wants her to do this: 👇🏽
That cat is also a nofologian wildlife bean body
Hey, I like Lil Big Feets!
I feel like Moriah should take most of her teeth squishes paint them and paint faces on them and make a “evil TEETH JAR🥰
You should make the peanut butter and jelly couple a plushy!
Love your videos! Would love to see you use the other teeth to make a series of dessert-themed cats of different breads!!!
Where’s the sprinkle song 😡
Next has to be a vid where she paints her mega squishies!
Is it just me or does the potato guy look like Mr. potato head?
"theyre ugly they're difficult, I dont like them them"  Missed opportunity to use the Doctor Phil clip
Ok I love when she doesn’t know what to make something for it’s so funny she just makes it a new bean body
Mr
you could’ve cut the inside of the last squishy and glued a small squishy inside of it as if they were stuck or something
ok but lets be real, Moriah should paint yearbook pages with her characters
It should be a 4 part series where you decorate the unicorn sisters
Finally ! Sooo excited
The "cute little cat" is my new fave besides pickle shelly and eustas
WE NEED A BURP PLUSHIE! Pleasseeee!!?!
missed opportunity to make a TOOTH fairy
8:49 I have a Calico you think she would be like nice calicos are nice they're fierce they're very mean as well cuz if you try and touch it it will the faceoff so be careful
All of these turned out so well! While I love the pastel and rainbow, I really enjoyed the colour scheme on the first one and the forced creativity via the limiting shape of the squishies was so entertaining and the tooth one was so smart! Please do more like this that pushes you outside of your comfort zone it's very entertaining and good results I think!
These vids are the on;y ones I ever watch the whole thing like Moriah  should be a more noticeable YouTuber
I love the name she comes up with 😂😂😂
Is watching moriah and eating rockets NOT the best thing EVER!?
it's ok. i'm in love with lil' big feets. heccin' adorable.
Mariah can you please name hi  Wonder❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😢😢
Imagine little big feets becomes the new pickle obviusly not as cute butt lol
MORIAH!!!!! A Tooth Fairy for when your littles lose thier teeth! what a cute prop!
Who else thought rainbow braces would've been cute on the mouth squishy??❤
Little big feets is my spirit animal
Yearly seashell video!!
If I had to do the teeth squishy I would turn it upside down, it's a bunny blob 😁 xx
Maybe you should make the squishy that has a lot of teeth into a macaron🤷‍♂️🤷
Why did you wanna do ginormous squishy‘s?
Have you ever seen Decora fashion? I think you'd rlly like it. Its very cute and colorful
Moriah can you make a thing mount a unucorn. This is what i mean a fat unycorn being rite my something please
But i had questions😢
I’ve been waiting for months for Moriah to paint the neon yellow blob please paint it😢
Man for the teeth you should of added “taste the rainbow” of on the teeth as like a skittles reference
Hey Moriah, are u gonna give us another  opportunity to buy a strawberry hoodies. My birthday is coming up and I really want to buy one.
I love!!!!! LILL BIG FEET!!!! AHHHHHH❤ I NEED A PLUSHY OF HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!
She shouldve made Mr. Potato Head 😅 but it's still cute.
Moriah can you please do one of the big squishes please ❤
okay, when i saw the teeth, i immediately thought of a rainbow metalic grill with cute charms on the teeth!! i love what you did with them in the end, i think they are funky and i actually realllyyy like them! if they were shrunk down into earrings, i would wear them!
little bigfeetz is super cute. I like him. same with kittie. XD I wait so long for these vids.
Could've turned one of the giant unicorns into a donkey with the last set of teeth
Do a SWEET TOOTH!!! A tooth thats dessert themed!
I was hoping you were going to put the giant teeth into the head of one of the giant unicorns… that’s why I don’t have an art channel 😂
Teeth ❤
Moriah should make a calendar with her characters in it! (At some point) like if you agree. (Also love you moriah😊)
I'm 3 hours late, so, sorry! 🤗🤗🤗 Loved this vid, and I'm sorry for what you had to go through 😳😳😳
obsessed with dessert calico
When I first saw the dentures I thought it was a cake lol 😂
Wait she should have put the weird mouth thing in the peach that would have been coolio
Moriah! For the teeth you can just turn them upside down and make them into a bunny! OH NVM I JUST GOT TO THE PART WHERE U NOTICED IT-
I love these squishy make overs!
the missed opportunity to make a "sweet tooth" squishy is just tragic!
Havent finished the video, but you could make the dentures have braces that look like your characters
I LOVE LITTLE BIG FEETSsS
i lowk wish the bigfeets wouldve been turned into a weird-moth looking type of bean body, but i am still 1000000% in love with him! i think i just always think of moths when i see fuzzy hehe
I don't enjoy watching you struggle  but apparently you like to hurt me and watch me struggle. I hate you and I'm better than you and you should stop acting pathetic and change because your obviously the problem!
I have been having really bad anxiety recently and being able to watch this video helped a lot!
I know nothing about squishes, but maybe you could recycle the ones you don't like to help with other projects?  Just a suggestion, I don't know if it'd work. I love you vids!
I literally thought she just enlarged pics of normal size squishys to do the thumbnails.
I need a link for that blob squishy...
I’m at the part where like you were telling me to do unicorns you use so many fun nails I was really really excited to see one of those videos because I was like when I first saw one of those nails I was like oh my god she’s gonna pick the unicorn my God. Oh my god oh my God oh my God
“The big boys”😂🤭
Random thought... Turn peach into alien bean body?? just a thought :)
I think little big feets is adorable justice for little big feets
I ADORE MARIAHS VIDEOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 😍🥰😘🥳🤩
Cut off the teeth and it could have been a taco
You forgot the tail on the cat
She could have put on rainbow braces on the dentures
Maybe you should turn the peach into a pumpkin for upcoming Halloween 🎃
Can I plz plz plz have the velvet squishes I love them so much ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love you you’re the best you’re the best best best best best best time ever and you’re my favorite. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I love your channel
What about painting a “sweet tooth”? Like, a tooth painted to look like a dessert
Omg!!! How did you not connect 6 of the teeth by braces and have each one w a color of the rainbow?!?!
Future thinking-- use the teeth for a keepsake or activity when your babies lose their first teeth! Turn them into little tooth fairies!!
You didn't put on the spinkle song😢
I like the dencher, it’s kinda weird but I also l the other two a lot
I love this video idea!!!! Please please please do a part 2 I would love that!!!!!❤❤❤
Am I the only one who sees the teeth squishies and immediately sees Totoro and his lil buddies? I would love a small army of totoros
nooo pls do the giant squishies!! 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺(love ur vids)
for the teeth squishy you should make a tooth fairy, love your videos ❤
The tooth looks so much like those lil cuties (I think they're goblins? Or forest spirits) from my neighbour Totoro
They turned out so good. Esp the tooth one, super adorable!
I feel like the cat is a 'sweet tooth' cat and now i kinda want to see the whole range!!!! Different markings r different desserts 😻🥰🥞🍨🍩🍪🍰🧁🥧🍫🍬🍭
Am I the only one who saw the upside down tooth and thought... Totoro?
w😊
MORIAH.......YOU ARE............AMAZING......HOooOOwwWW DOoOOooOO YOoOoooOo DOoOOooOO IT I freaking can't function without rainbows,sprinkles,clouds,shelly,Eustis,Derek,Gorgie,pickle,derp,......YOU OPIE ECT. I LOVE YOU...........*of course I don't mean LOVE LOVE* anyway Byeeeeeesee😊
I LOVE LIL BIG FEETS😅
Hi how are you and your kids doing btw I'm one of your biggest fans ❤ hope you and your family are doing good
pleaseeeeeee do a giant one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You could make a castle out of one toth
Ok hear me out, this is a stretch You know how it's a thing for pirates to have gold teeth, you could of painted the tooth gold, give him and eye patch, paint him a swords, and give him a pirate hat.  Idk how you would sculpt one out of foom, but your talent always surprises me! Just wanted to throw that idea out! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
the potato is Tayto Potato, not Gudetama, hes so cute
I love Lil' Big Feets!
You can make a foot flower. Place them all side by side in a circle
Can you dress up as Big Feet’s?😂 I love your videos❤❤❤❤🐻
More teeth peep animals please! Sooo cute
Here in the first day
we need a name for the cat!!!
You should customize a key board and each letter would have a different character! Like and repost so Moriah can see!!
ITSA POTATO MANNN
All of the teeth could be a line of bean bodies or different breeds of cat
OMG Li'l BigFeets is my favorite. Please make him a plushie, I'll buy 2. (Literally...my 8-year-old son ALSO loves him. I'm 36 and I want the same toy as my son who is 8. Please help me.)
The tooth cats name should be Coco.  It’s just so darn cute.
For the feet you could of made a troll! I ❤ your videos btw, and the amount of effort you put into each one is incredible! 💖💖💖💖💖
i wonder what else you could have made with the denture squishy ;/ you did great with what you had. the only other thing it made me think of was an ice sandwich that was melted at the back lol. but that would have required some tooth removal surgeries lol
What do you guys want moriah Elizabeth to be this Halloween?  👻                            👇
Love your videos moriah❤❤❤❤❤
You skipped the sprinkle song
Mariah can you please make spark available on all phone brands I was really sad when I found out that it wasn't  on my Samsung phone 😢😢😢
Lil big feets themesong:     🎵 Lil’ big feets, Whereever you go Lil’ big feets lots and lots of toes! Lil’ big feets, lurking the woods! Lil’ big feets, This is the big toe anthem song! Lil’ big feets, Where ever you go, Lil’ big feets, lots and lots of toes Lil’ big feets, lurking the woods! Lil’ big feets, This is the big toe anthem song! 🎵   Hope you like this Moriah!
I love little big feet's and the tooth bunny! The dentures are terrifying but good job! 😊
Can you paint my house 😂jk
UWU
Is anyone else wishing she made a tooth fairy?
I love them please do more
Some of the teeth shapes reminds me of Totoro when they're upside down,
the peep has always been and always will be a bunny, not a cat lmao
I love little big feet!❤
Were did all the commemts go??😂            Listen here idk where they are              You still there?                                           Omg i see the commemts!!
I was thinking of a burger for the mouth with teeth
I would have made the last one into a shell and on the inside  like water...
I was the one who sent the teeth set💀💀
i named the cute kitty cara-cat. ikik, groundbreaking
This is amazing. My favourite one is the bunny is so adorable and amazing. Adorable, adorable, yes
YOU DIDNT DRAW A TAIL
I think it would’ve been really cool if you added rainbow braces to the teeth squishie
she should  make  it a series
But the unicornsssss 😭😭😭
How does the QUEEN of desserts miss the opportunity for a SWEET TOOTH!? 😂❤
I love the alien bean body!!! 😍😍😍 I do for some reason kind of feel like his toe nails should be painted 😂
I thought the 1st was mr potato head !!
If you get anymore open mouth squishes you could make  It a clam and ad a pearl inside? Just and idea, you do you.
The teeth could have been made into a shark head.... she should do that In The fixing my messed up squishy series
Ur the best :3
The mouth could be nofloeyen mouth
thw big squishy would have been satisfying 🤩 also can u make more teeth?? There so cuteee
you could make a giant nofalofugus berry
The peach could be a giant planet…
I love how Moriah never tells us to subscribe or like but just moves on unlike other youtubers... Love you Moriah!
is It weird that I really like Big Feets the bean body???😅
ive said this before, i'll say it again- you can make a "sweet" tooth. its right up your alley!!!!!!!! id love to see your creation of a sweet tooth
MORIAHHH THE TEETH DENTURES COULDA BEEN A MACARON
You missed an opportunity to make a tooth fairy. A tooth with wings
Yessss I love the cat tooth you should make her using a normal cat! Also you should do a part two and make the big squishes lol
Upside down it looks like the little guy from Totoro
I think moriah should make braces with all the teeth squishies
U make everything beautiful!! 0o0
Moriah don’t forget your annual seashell painting! Summer is almost over!
I literally tune in every Friday since 2016 cuz I love ur vids so very much and I love EVERY VID YOU POST! And this video is hilarious CHUBBY POTATO GUY🥔
MAKE A GIANT ANGRY LEMON WITH THE PEACH
For the animal potato bean body the original you could’ve made him mr potato from toy story 😭
You should name the big foot squishy wally and love your vids🎉
This is very entertaining.
Heres the nafalogian anthem i made  Oh Nafalafagus with the bright green glow from the sun  Oh Nafalafagus with the berries The ones in the shade and the the ones in the sun But it doesn't matter,  cause they all taste great Oh our home , Nafalafagus  Oh our home we will never destroy  Oh our founder Moriah Elizabeth The one the that made us all Oh us inhabitants  The responsible ones and the really weird ones But it doesn't matter , cause we all are great Oh our home , Nafalafagus  Oh our home , we will never destroy
Great job, I love little Bigfoot. I got excited to hear the sprinkle song and it didn't play, maybe next time.
The teeth look like a pink macaroon 😂
I heard that if you say your fav YouTuber you get pinned. Moriah Elizabeth Moriah Elizabeth Moriah Elizabeth
You could make a little family of tooth fairies! I'm sure you have a lots of wings in your stash!😊😊😊
You should make teeth 🦷 with different personalities and colors representing each personality🌈 I think it would be a nice idea!!
missed an opportunity- Teeth could have been a clam shell/oyster buddy!  *now realizes that if I suggest it, I should be making it myself though to be fair*  Inspiration is HARD~
I think Moriah should’ve given the big feets painted toenails XD
A tooth fairy would have been really cute! Like putting wings on the tooth to make it a tooth fairy
There was a massive missed opportunity here! You could have made the walking dentures from Toy Story! Would have been so cute!
You could make a tooth fairy out of the teeth! Also the gums reminded me of a dinosaur jaw, haha. Not sure why.
You had 6 feet you could have made rainbow feet hah
Moriah always makes the most creative things, I love her channel! 😊
The front of the set of teeth kinda looks like it could be a dessert from nafalafugus
They are just so cute!!!!
The cat is now my favorite thing ever and I love it so much
Omg hi 😍😍
Please please take the idea of putting the teeth together in jagged ways then give them braces😭 they can all have little angsty faces cause they are like siblings who have to stick together
Oo you could take wings from some other squishy donator and make a tooth fairy!
MORIAH I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU FORGOT YOUR ANUAL SEASHELL VIDEO
Just a heads up you forgot the tail on the cat
giant rainbow peach
I love the tooth kitty!
DO THE JUMBO SQUISHIES!!!!! YOU KNOW YOU NEED TOO!
u should take all the teeth and make a line of different creatures called “the tooth fairies”
first thing with the feet couldve been mr.potato head😭
For some reason, I thought of making the actual teeth rainbow instead of the "inner mouth part thing" lol
Yay 😁 she posted!!!!!
I think you could make the dentures/mouth set of teeth into like some sort of rainbow slide or a taco thing
If Moriah is making videos when she's 80 the videos will be called "customizing my denture" and "making myself a cane out of Squishies"
Idea for the teeth squishes how about blob bunnies!
When she said "watch this at the end of the ranking list" that just reminded me that this year went by so quickly its almost that time of the year for the ranking list 😔😭
If you ever do a tooth one again you can turn it into the tooth fairy by giving it wings! I love what you did with it instead though it’s much more creative.
Dang wanted you to do the giants, Moriah. But still, Lilbigfeets is so cute!
The first on needs some nice toe nails 💅
What to do with the dentures? Add them to the giant peach, easy.
a tooth could be an alien bean body the roots bieng legs
the first one when you said do you know who it is, i though you were going to say mr.potato head
SHE FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG😭☹️😭☹️😭☹️☹️😭☹️😮😭😮😭😭😭😭😭
Is it ok if I try to do a squishy makeover? I don't want to just make a video and you hear about it and you are like how dare
Moriah why do you always murder the cutest squishes for other squishes
A "sweet" tooth would have been cool!!!💓
I thought that making the dentures a taco type of dessert would salvage how unsettling it was
Paint the tooth dessert theme, then it will be a  ✨sweet tooth✨
Moriah I think you need to clear the squishies you have now before you open new squishes
Moriah could gave turned the last squishy into a smore
Thank you 🙏 for all that you do ❤
Mariah, my darling 💅, why don't you make the rest of your alien bean bodies into slushies. Or maybe all of them into one big painting? Just a thought. Also love you Mariah 🩷🩷🩷🩷
who else thought that she was talking about the little white Totoro at 8:30 PS: Moriah you should definitely turn three of the teeth into the three Totoro's
I saw Totoro from the tooth💀
I'm not a fan of any of these creations The bean body person's paint job was hideous and I feel like the other two were just simple cop-outs just to make a video two thumbs down down down
I thought she was going to make a “sweet” tooth… and make the teeth candy or fruit
My pain when she said “Gudatama” 📈📈📈
I actually think the took provided the perfect shape for the cute lil bunny! 🥰
You should take the rest of the teeth  and make a family of dessert  cats ... Like  a strawberry one and  even a rainbow sherbet one ...
I LOVE little big feets ❤🥹
When the tooth was turned upside all I could think of was the bunnies from Totoro
I would put the rainbow🌈 set of teeth🦷🦷 inside the peach🍑 and make a huge face LOL🤭 you could turn it into a jack-o'-lantern for Halloween🎃🤣
The dentures kinda could’ve been a taco or some pastry but that’s would’ve taken time
Gonna need a part 2 to this😂
Who else loves Moriah❤❤❤ ⤵️
I WANT a part 2 please 😂
When are you going to make an Opie squishy
I love Moriah she always puts so much effort into her vids 💕💕 Also did anyone else realise she DIDN'T play the sprinkle song😭
She forgot the SPRINKLE SONG🤔
Your videos always cheer me up❤❤❤
If you want to fix the mouth one. Maybe you can make it a cave or something.
Thank you for fixing that spot on toothcats face! It was driving me crazy 😭
SHE HAD TO MAKE IT A BEANBODY
Little big feets is utterly adorable omg, I love him! Hope we can see more of him
Who else just randomly found Moriah and now watches her regularly?
Omg the teeth could’ve been a taco
You should also make a yearbook for your characters the seniors are the oldest ETC and you should also do awards like class clown and ETC love your content moriah
i love your videos girl but you forgot the sprinkles song THE SPRINKLES SONG .
Make some soft and slow squishys like nilla (all my friends want u too)
With the teeth, you should make a set!! One Tory can be rainbow, one gold, one silver, one rotting and the rest can be random colours lol ❤❤❤
Where’s the sprinkle song😡🔥😾🍩🍭🍬
It would be super cool if you put some bling on the teeth! Give it a grill🤩🤩
I love little big feet’s❤
I think you should take a tooth and add fairy wings to the back and make a tooth fairy *budum ch*    I’ll see myself out😂
Whoever is saying their tired of the alien bean body's is a lier
The gradient rainbow on the teeth is gorg but the actual teeth 🤢
The mouth could have been made into a clam not a very good one but one nonetheless
she should of put like a squishy fruit in the mouth
I absolutely LOVE the bean body!!!!!
“I get sent a lot of teeth” Moriah the tooth fairy confirmed???
CLAME UR EARLY TICKET HeREE 👇🏼
AHHH I LOVE THE BEAN BODY
All of the teeth upside down look like Totoro
She forgot the sprinkle song…
Great job!!!!!!!❤😊 And Peep is my dog’s name!😊❤🐶
Does anyone notice she doesn’t play the sprinkle song?
Little big foot is actually amazing.
Anyone else agree that we need an entire family of teeth bunnies!?!?!?!?!
I saw the teeth to be turned into a cream puff or macron ;-;
The cat made from the tooth looks like it could be a Sanrio or Sumiko Garashi character.
A funky colorful braces would took those teeth of another level!
the dentures could have been a clam or shell with something inside!
She is so awesome 😎 like how does she come up with these ideas it’s just awesome keep up the good work moriah😊
I saw a cat today in the Beanfield it ran away and I think it’s a loan and I can’t find it  it ran into the Beanfield🐱🐈😔☹️😩
What if you added two feet to the teeth making it the wind-up teeth toys????
More Little big feet’s Please copy and paste
omigod little big feets is my favorite alien beanbody of all time (and thanq for the tutorial on how to make one lol)
Big thumbs up.👍 She did so well I really loved the cat and Little Big Feets.😁
😢 please 🥺 spark android
Spark android please
Its time for Pastel Rainbow 🌈  Camouflage!!!
If you turned the teeth in their side, it might could have been a taco. Some scoops could hide the teeth shape
I love your videos ❤ you are the best❤
Make the set of teeth in to a desert 😮😊
If u wanna make the whole mouth of teeth seem better, it could be a macaron
Big foot doop
People who want to see more of lil big feets  | V
Rainbow braces on any of the teeth would've been cute I think? (maybe the dentures or make it a set that connects) but these were definitely interesting lol
What I would’ve done with the dentures is cut out the middle and then put like A cat head at the top and then put the middle of the body in there inside and on the bottom, I would put the legs lol
You should've made the mouth a clam😮
Imagine if people actually liked this comment 😂😂
She could have made mister feet’s with the feet lol
the up-side-down teeth look like they could be an army of little totoros
I LOVE calico cats
I like em!! I thought of a taco when I saw the jaw teeth
YOU SLAYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!
The teeth one that took a bite of the rainbow grilled cheese needs braces with rainbow colored rubber bands! 😉
I wonder how's mini-mini me?
No you aren’t
For the teeth, you can make a crown of teeth to put on another squishy head. You could have painted braces in your denture squishy. The chocolate bars do need cute faces, but they can each be different flavors, and maybe some have bites taken out of them.
The tooth squishies u can make them among us characters
For the peach Moriah should do jerry the cherry with a buttcrack!! I think it would be so cute.
Idea! Do a squishy makeover using only giant squishes! I’m not that creative so create some rules on how to decorate all your giant squishes
Moriah always makes me laugh in her videos and I’m pretty sure everyone does to ❤❤❤
Oh you brave brave soul
lil big feets needs to be a plush
I absolutely love Little Big Feeetss And Calico Kitty Bunny Peep And especially Rainbow Jaws I love them all And I'm so FREAKING HAPPY that you finally did these squishies You don't understand how long I've been waiting for you to get out your comfort zone ❤ I always saw you put them aside when I really wanted you to do atleast 1 But then you did several today! :D
His full name should be Harold Little Big feeties❤
The first dude looks like he'd he apart of the Banana Splits😂
I LOVE THAT CREATURE OMG ❤😭
Moriah you are the peak of my Fridays! I love seeing your videos and your energy!!! Love you so much!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You could have put the teeth on the side and made a dessert taco or something!!!
We need to make this an official series ❤️❤️❤️
Teethamals 😂
Hey Moriah. I think if you ever get another dentures squishy you should throw it in a jar and use it as a Halloween decoration
am i the only one who can smell the teeth set denture thingy? 💕 thanks for making my morning Moriah, you never fail to make we laugh and smile
Please let this be a continued series
Oh how I would love a super creepy squishy with teeth/feet and what ever else for Halloween
Little big foot is actually kinda cute!😊
can you sign your yearbooks and put them on pre order
give zuzu parents
Oh I'm so sick of her making alein bean body's I'm the first to say it
WAIT! YOU SHOULD HAVE TURNED THE TEETH INTO A CLAM! Also the “cat bunny” base looked like Totoro 👀
The tooth squishies could be a new kind of blob...tall, legged blob 😅
Little big feets reminded me of Wow Wow Wibble Woggle Wozzie Woodle Woo, that absolute fever dream of a movie by Tim Noah
The patio squishy my teacher has and I named him Mr Patio.
i think She could have made a character inside of the teeth  as if it was happy durning its last bit of life
Are you ever gonna show us your new baby?
another thing u could do with the tooth squishies is make one of those cute tooth shaped floss containers and make it have like rainbow designs/branding
8:35 the teeth looks soooo mucchhhh like the white creature in my neighbor totoro!!
I love your squishy‘s I’m nine I love your videos. Could you do a Harry Potter squishy
You are the reason why I like Fridays!
That tooth cat is adorable. You should turn all the teeth into themed cats
If you reshape the tops of the teeth to be more round, they could be blobs, maybe? 🤔 They would just need some arms 😅
Big feets desperately needs toenails
My hopes of you seeing my past comments were so high when you pulled out the feet and a blob. Make a big foot squishy!!!!!! You can make it cotton candy, themed or snow cone themed!!!!!
I love the alien bean bodies❤
Am I the only one who thinks it would be cool if we created Bean Body OCs                Anybody……
Soo I have an idea for the teeth set make your characters into like braces I mean I would wach it
Little big feet’s is officially my new favourite character
Can you please remake the teeth into a taco
The teeth mouth thing could’ve been a cake
Hey Moriah how’s Opie your cat?
At first I thought she was gonna make a rainbow foot collection
Why don't you just make a teeth family generation and they come out the mouth when the people teeth fall out
I actually feel like you need to make MORE Bean bodys 😊
Moriah could’ve made a tooth into a “sweet tooth” by turning it into a tooth shaped cake
I have an Idea: Put feet on the tooth!
Hear me out…… I literally LOVED them, but WHAT ABOUT A “FAKE-OVER”?!?!😮🩵🩵
Moriah is so respectable. She has a family to take care of and she still makes time to make videos for us ❤
The teeth could have made a really weird purse.
Vid 5 of asking moriah to paint the thumbnail unicorn
I love the feet too much
Nice
I feel like little big feet would walk around and all you’d hear is stomps and then you look down and there’s this THING with huge feet just staring up at you
8:54 this was from my favorite squishy makeover video!
Did I see a Mr. Potato?
Hi I love your videos they are so funny and you work so hard and have a kid and a newborn home thank you ❤
Hi I love your videos and I think you are so funny and you are so good at painting on hard surfaces. Ps : I Love small big feets
I fell like she could’ve used the rainbow teeth to make a shark that is what I thought 😅
Moriah probably won't see this but the teeth kind of look like skinny apples she could make a basket of apples out of the teeth.
The space cat knocked down in the background triggered me, moriah if you see this help the space cat stand ❤❤❤
Sprinkle song… 😢
Can you please paint little big foots toenails?
Family Fudge did make a rainbow grilled cheese sandwich once 😊 lol
love the colors on lil feets <33
Mop?
Why not use the rest of the feet squishy's toes as a head crest for a rooster squishy?
Moriah! Your seashell video!!
Big Feetssssss is so CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Did Moriah ever do a sea shell painting video this year?
I have a chocolate people plushies
THE BUNNY COULD BE A NEW SPECIES OF BLOB
here before 20k likes 👇🏽
You could have made the teeth a clam shell !!
Those teeth are terrifying haha! I was really hoping that you were going to somehow turn it into a layered cake. Maybe next time!
I think using the other teeth and smaller teeth would be a cute family to go with the calico desert kitty
I really like the cat Derrick. That’s when I got the idea for a Derrick plush! I’m not sure that’s possible but it’s an idea!
Pls do the tiny plastic babys
The teeth made me think of among us imposter 😂
Can you turn a squishy into a slugcat if you don't know what that is look it up. Now there cute.
Moriah you should decorate the tiny plastic babys since you dont like to paint tiny stuff you dont have to be detailed but i know you can PLSSS. Do the tiny plastic babby
oh my stars I loooove this! the tooth cat could be named Sweet Tooth or Sweetie for short 🥺🥹
The cat is literally the CUTEST thing I've ever seen!!!😍🥺
If you filled the tooth gaps in the last one and painted it cake colors it might have kind of looked like an ice cream sandwich type dessert.
Finally she posted a squishy makeover I've been coming for days for this.
Moriah, you are SO brave. And that’s another reason why I love your videos!
If you don't like the set of teeth can i have them?
Oh no,  big feets is so CUTE!
I love the cat. Please make a whole cat family out of all the teeth
Could've used the dentures as teeth for one of the big Squishies. Not sure if that would've been cute but
My thought was make a sweet tooth XD
I was like a tooth what can you do with that? And then she made the adorable little kitty, never doubt  Moriah.
Beautiful work as always; I like all 3. However, I would watch ME read a newspaper just to see that pretty face. Hard to believe just a few years ago she was wowing 1-2 million subscribers from a small desk with an even smaller table behind her in a rented basement apartment. NOT hard to see why she will soon have 10 million subscribers; she has an amazing talent for art/color/design/etc. she's funny, & she's pretty (plus she's a video editor par excellence). She is phenomenal. 🙂🙂👍👍👍
Not gonna lie, the mouth kinda looked like that one pokemon
I honestly wanted her to turn one of them into a tooth with braces :)
wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ok, but that giant peach kinda looks like that Cherry Blob (can’t remember his name)
give braces
OMG NEE MORIAH VIDEO ‼️
Ive seen so much…  to think that this animal .. is actually beautiful ❤😊
MAKE THE TEETH INTO BUNNIES
I don't normally comment, but Moriah! Missed opportunity to put a gumball in the mouth! 😂
Hello
There is so many comments already 😂😅
FACE your fears moriah elizabeth 😮
sprinkle song!
Show you house
Can u make a baby lieon hair care out of the shampoo bottles? Also can you paint baby bottles(copy and paste pls) Make this a comment bomb
Can i just say before she said cat/bunny for the tooth I was like "Totoro! It looks like the mini totoros"
The process behind how she chose to do rainbow for the inside of the mouth is the same process my adhd brain goes through anytime I do literally anything except my adhd brain is doing it with much more much faster😂
I actually love little big feets it think he’s really cute! ❤🌈
Would you paint something candy corn colors.
How dare, lil big feet’s is a cutie 🥺
Ooohhhh okay all of these turned out so cute!!  you know what would’ve been really super adorable with the tooth one? Doing a ‘sweet tooth’ theme. Like a tooth that’s a dessert!
pt 2 plz
Love itttt
I love little big feetss
Idea to redo mouth squishy: teeth as chocolate, gums as cake, and then add filling. As for the back, give it to a character to hold or eat 😁
TEETH SQUISHIES: Would love to see you make tooth fairy squishies for your daughters! 🦷🧚‍♂️
Ok hear me out... giant peach squishie as Jerry the Cherry!
Wait you can make um the teeth into blobs!!somehow…..
you making a candy Squishy for Halloween?
we have failed there was no shells this summer.
Turn the tooth upside down and you have a bunny head and dentures could be a sandwich.
How many kids are watching you channel cause I'm 8 years old and I love your videos. ❤
She forgot the tail on the cat
Could you pleaseeeee make a little big feet’s plushie 🙏🏼
Early (kinda)
you can turn the tooth in to Totoro
finly
at short glance the teeth look like a cute lil pink macaron!! ;v;
I just thought of the best idea what if you made a yearbook but with ALL of your characters
Could you please do low vent for your next video?
What if moriah made a tooth-cat version of all her cat characters to use up her tooth squishies? Would that be cute?
Hey Moriah, as someone with autism who shouts at my screen: "Hey! The background changed!" I feel validated by your announcements 😂
You could always use the set of teeth and the giant peach squishy together to create a character. Like cut a hole in the peach to fit the teeth in and go from there 😂
Who else loves little big feets  👇
Moriah you should have put braces in the teeth and make it chew RAINBOW GUM
You should make a dollhouse and dolls
I love your videos so much❤ I’ve  liked your video since I was 2 I was just wondering if you could maybe make a frog bean body?  If not it’s ok love you ❤
JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH, do an interpretation of that movie 🥰
A RAINBOW CAVITY TOOTH
An idea for the mouth squishy. Paint braces onto the teeth with your characters on each tooth
MORIAH I LOVE YOU!!! I've been watching your channel since I was 7 im turning 13 Monday <3
Cut open the peach and put the teeth w/gums into it then create a monster for Halloween. Use the single tooth’s for a Mohawk or spikes
Pls do this again
Moriah Elizabeth is the one thing I will never grow out of
Cut a hole in the peach and put the teeth inside the peach 😂
I’d love to see a video where she decorates all of the teeth, then it would be a group of weirdly shaped cats.
I love your ideas and the tooth was genius! If you ever decide to redo the mouth, I have an idea. You could cut out the middle between the teeth and make it look like it’s eating mini dessert squishes!
YOU COULD HAVE MADE THE TEETH THOSE TOY WIND UP TEETH WITH THE EYES
Okay I haven’t fully watched the video yet, but if she didn’t do the set of dentures, imagine each tooth representing a character! Like a Georgie tooth!!!!!
OK now I’m forcing you to make a part two
the dentures could have been a clam with a pearl or oyster
You could turn the dentures into vampire teeth since Halloween is coming up.
Hey Moriah! If you ever wanted to do something with the teeth, you could add little wings to the back and make it a little tooth fairy! You could even do a rainbow set of little tooth fairies where the wings are the colors of the rainbow! Like if you agree!
I think it would be a really cool idea if you take the tooth squishies and make more animals in the same style as that cat
For the shapes you are avoiding, dont see them as they are but as shapes you can add. The toes look like bubbles if you cut them off. the individual teeth, you could turn them upside down, and they could be the top of a spiky succulent plant. The large ones, maybe the peach, you just paint a LARGE ME on it , so your logo can be in the background. That full set of teeth I would have cut them and use the teeth shape as like a border to another squishy. Thank you for your work!
I wate all week for yore vids u are my highlight of my day
yes me too
im only 3 minutes in but.. she can use the teeth squishes to make her blobs into squishes! if she cuts the nubby tops and round them off yknow??
2.2K IN 2 HOURS!?
Don't forget the annual seashell video!!!
NO SPRINKLE SONG 😭
Please paint the jumbo squishies NOW
Moriah, you should have cut out the inside of the tooth and made it a cat taco or made the teeth the inside of the taco and the outside the shell!
For the first one you could of done mr potato 🥔 (toy story, and for mini me)
All the teeth would make the cutest cat family :3
Could make the teeth into blobs with no arms it’s just legs
the teeth remind me of some weird ice cream sandwich in a way
The set of teeth should have been a cake
She should turn all her Alien bean body’s into squish🤩  👇🏻Copy and paste so she see this comment
Moriah you forgot the sprinkle song 😢😢😢
You didn’t do your panting sea shells were is that video (no pressure sorry) (or you have and I don’t remember sorry if you did)
That Alien Bean-Body must be named Tobby :'3
The mouth could have been really cute as a little city! The teeth could be the windows of apartments, the main section could be buildings or trees, and do the same for the bottom with houses you could full with characters! It might be a little odd, but it would make it more fun and interesting and less,,,, teeth. Good stuff as always!
I really like little big feetsss it is so adorable and very huggable looking
Should of done diamond teeth like rappers have 😂😂😂
You should make a entire cat family out of the teeth
YES YES YES YES
I can’t believe she didn’t turn the peach into a giant monster using the full set of teeth and some feet. Would have been great for Halloween.
If Moriah were my mom my whole life will be better than barbie 😭😭
Idk why, the last one kinda looks like a macaron/ some kind of pastry... like bignès or something
I love it! 💕 An idea for the next tooth squishy. An sweet tooth! And you color it literally like colorful candy! 🍬🍭
Why is little big feets actually adorable
7:37 remember Mr feets galacticats sidekick😊
I really want to send my squishes but I also wanna keep them but there really ugly and torn up
slay
I'm actually in love with lil big feets😭
I love this but where was the sprinkle song
you can make the peach into a planet!!! maybe nafolofugus? (i probably didnt spell that right)
It’s Totoro!!! It’s little Totoro!!
You should make a dollhouse for your kids ❤
You could have turned the set of teeth into a cake/cookie sandwhich. The teeth could be whipped cream, the inside the filling. The end part that doesnt have any teeth could be a wrapper.
You had the opportunity to do a ”SWEET-tooth” 😅 Really good video btw!💕
I want to see her cut the face of a giant squishy open and shove the teeth in there so the giant squishy can be taking a big ol' bite out of a big ol' dessert
I love Love, love, love, love, love, love, love love, love love love love love
Unicorn triplets?????? Please I’ll cry, lmao
I’m so obsessed with the cat..tooth..blob..thing. It’s so cute! I think she should make a series of decorating her teeth squishes into animals! ❤️
Use the ones that you never want to paint as materials for other squishy makeovers
Make the peach into a mouth then put the teeth 🦷 in the mouth please
The way that first alien squishy dude looks like a character out of My Singing Monsters
You Could Have Made A Desert Sandwhich Out Of The Teeth/Jaw Squishy By Cutting Out The Back Of It Where It Is Flat 0:00
An idea for the teeth Squishies. Decorate them and donate them to a dentist's office especially if there is a local children's dentist. Could be a simple paint job, but they also have something they could give kids during visits.
I want to see her paint all her giant squishys
I have been avoiding my reading assignments because they are long and boring.
Maybe you could make the peach a pumpkin and do a squishy jackolantern
Watching this at 11:01 pm oh ye
OPIE?
The giant peach is obviously supposed to be planet nuffalufagous
You should make a tooth fairy out of one of the teeth! 🧚‍♀️
Make the peach into nofalafagous
ok i actually love little big feets he is really strange but like in an adorable way
She should’ve changed the mouth into a cookie…🤯
I love the Big Feetss
Tbf you could have turned the last one, the set of teeth into a cream puff or something with he teeth being cream dollops
Add wings?  Make it a tooth-fairy
Cat series!! CAT SERIESSSSSS
If Moriah had a chance to get a calico cat she would probably name it after a food. Every time she paints a calico she relates it to food😂
The teeth squishies as Blob characters? They have blobby shapes, it could work
Honestly, I can see the teeth being revisited as fennec foxes... And I am fully here for it. The bunny idea was better since the shape of the now-ears are a bit too prominent for a cat, but it still turned out pretty well, so props to you for that!
Little-Big Feet is adorable!
you should do rainbow teeth!!
For the peach, you should make Jerry the cherry with the butt🍑🍑🍑
anyone else devastated that she didn't make it into a mister potato head 😢
you should name the cat sweet tooth >^.^<
Should of played the sprinkles song when she was painting on the sprinkles on the Calico cat!!💕 love you moriah
Come on bring out the massive green booger monster.
What if you painted ….        On erasers (idk it just came in my head)
Moriah where's your cat? I miss him 😢.
You could have made the set of teeth into a cookie sandwich!
for an idea for the giant peach and the millions of teeth- give the peach teeth!😁
You should bling out the teeth of the last squishy, add some tooth gems!
Moriah Elizabeth do not insult good Emmitt Anna and her again I don't know how to spell whatever his name is I know what it is I just don't know how to spell it it's spell check is not helping okay just know it's whatever the I know what his name is I know what his name is this I just can't spell it and spell check is not helping neither is Google help help help help help do not insult him by Eminem ft I'm a lover by him I love love love him big fan of his name I'm sorry
I’m soo happy after the vid :D ☺️
Moriah you missed an opportunity to make a Fairy Tooth! That was literally the first thing that came to my mind when I saw it. Make a cute little tooth into a fairy!
She should have print
idea for the teeth: paint it like dessert themed (maybe the roots like ice cream cones, top like ice cream with sprinkles) bam. sweet tooth.
Calicos are always girls I love your tooth cat lol
Loved this! Ngl the calico cat gave me pizza hut converted into a bank vibes.
Little Big Feets kinda looks like when a toy brand decides to make boy and girl versions of their toy lines, and it's part of the "Boy Line" of alien beans lol. Still cute though. I think the creepy teeth set could have worked add on/in a large squishy 🤔 still probably would have looked a bit weird though.
Moriah is my comfort YouTuber I have literally thought about using my phone in school so many times just to watch her❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Hi
Do u like Gudetama
I love how you are naturally sarcastic 🙃
You should do a desert themed SWEET TOOTH
Who wants her to do a part 2 🙋‍♀️
I thought Moriah would have done a “sweet tooth” have the tooth with icing and sprinkles on top. 😅 but I love the bunny. ❤
Can we just talk about how much effort she puts into these videos
YES THANK YOU Also ME you always say you don’t have any ideas when it comes to these amorphous shapes but you forgot about THEMING THEM, now do I know how to theme teeth and feet? No. But I feel like it may give you some more wiggle room for ideas, love you ❤
Im a dental hygienist and i NEED THOSE TEETH
Would've loved to see some cute rainbow braces on the full set of teeth! 😮
When you think you are early but you are an hour late😭😭😭
Love your work 🩷❤️🧡💛💚🩵💙💜
EARLY TICKET HERE!🎉 🎫
I think the teeth look like a scallop opening its mouth.
I would’ve made the dentures into like a pearl clam thing because that’s what I thought of
wow I'm sorry i doubted you, you actually pulled off the feet lol
You could turn the other teeth into a family of different cats to go with the Calico cat tooth
noice
I really hope lil big feets makes a reappearance I love him so much
I once had a galaxy theme gradiant blue tooth sqiushy😁 just for inspiration, it was really cute
Moriah is the tooth fairy
Moriah is the definition of the best YouTuber to exist
POV you're looking for a comment that doesn't say how amazing Moriah is....  Not saying you aren't, Moriah, but you definitely need a new comment section...... Anyway I really loved this video! Especially some of the memes that we don't see too often! The beanbody is totally a little Nahfologian woodland creature! It looks like a mix of a bunny and a squirrel. Also, I think that around Easter, you should make a video turning more of your teeth into different Peeps! Your cat turned out way cuter than I expected!    I hope you and your family are doing well!
I was expecting you to make an alien tooth fairy maybe!
You should make the cat live in dounutsville!
when will  you do another Q&A?
Literally watching this after my tooth fall😂  I Love your videos ♥️
Moriah I have a good idea for the mouth if you want to paint  over it you should turn into a melted cake
I love Moriah's vids they are funny,cool,creative,and intresting.❤💕
Omg I need more of those cat/bunny teeth lol. Their a simple cute! ❤
The teeth would be great cat blobs just turn them upside down and boom! Cat ears and cat blobs!
the teeth coild of been made into a toothfary by adding wings and the dentures could of been a weird teth burger with some bun donation
If u redo this with the teeth i think one with the crown would make a cute tooth fairy.
Next time can you please please please do the big ones!
I think braces on the teeth would be really cute 😅
what about moriah can customize a dollhouse with rooms based on her characters (Georgie, Pickle, Derp, etc)! It would be so cute to see how they would live in their own little rooms. copy and paste to make it happen
Hi Moriah Elizabeth love your videos 🎉 I hope that you have a great day
But where was the sprinkle song??? 😢😂
When are you gonna do your annual q and a
Maybe you could paint on balloons🎈
Who else instantly clicks moriah's videos as soon as you see them??
You should have done a among us out if the teeth or tooth 😂
I think moriah should make an army with people that are the Bean bodies enemy’s ! 💗
Peach = pumpkin/jack o lanterm Teeth= cats
Thank you for doing this video I was wondering if you would ever paint them
my favourite part of the day is when moriah posts a video for our squishy little hearts ❤😊
The teeth could be the base for some sort of blob characters!
You did not play the  Sprinkle song
Omg this makes me look forward to Friday every week 😊
I love your videos so much your the best youtuber in the world and my favorite your so talented and funny love you
Love your videos Moriah! You’re so awesome and creative!   I have a suggestion for the full set of teeth squishy you just made. You could take the big peach and make a character out of it using the mouth squishy as it’s mouth
With the denture like teeth, it would have been cool to paint some braces on and make the inside look like gum! So that it could be someone who got gum stuck in the brackets, lol
The teeth could have been a macaron or even a cookie!
You could have done rainbow braces
😊😊
Axolotl pls
WHERES THE SPRINKLE SONG😭
YOU COULD MAKE A BLOODY TOOTH FOR SPOOKY SEASON!!
The teeth could make interesting blob shapes I think!
moriah the seam on the left foot is bothering me sm
Please can you do another Q&A also what is your newborn’s new nickname?
People hear before 24 hours: 🎉
But I had a question
I wonder if you could turn the teeth squishies into blobs
Tooth bunny/cat is so cute ❤️
Never gets old ❤😊 i just realized how artistic Moriah is! She turns a tooth into a cat and a Bigfoot bean-body! 😂 She’s always been artistic!! I love these video!!! ✨❤️
Little Big Feets is much cuter than expected !
do the big squshies!!!!!!!!
Little big feet reminded me of mr potato,this Chanel is the best
What about the toucan squishy😢
The teeth could be used in something based on "my shiny teeth and me" from the fairly odd parents
You could’ve done the teeth gums squishy into a melting cake or a house 🤧
Hi Moriah ur so awaomeeeee
I love you ❤
If you ever get another set of dentures you could always set them on their side and make it into a taco 😊
I LOVE Big Feets. I imagine all the creatures think he is much bigger than he is because of the big foot prints
I think I’m in love with that cat squishy 🥹
The mouth squishy looks like something you'd see in an orthodontist office
The upside down tooth shape reminds me of the little blue and white spirit characters in the animated movie  Totoro.
What if she did those baby bottles to match some of her characters!!? 7:54
I love Moriah and her videos so much I wish they could last longer ❤ !
I wonder how far down on the squishy ranking list those teeth are gonna be
Dang I’m early
She forgot the squishy costing
Lets just appriciate how moriah edits her videos, just to entertain us😊😊😊
OH MY GOSH I LOVE THE CARAMEL AND CHOCOLATE CAT❤️❤️❤️
I kind a wish she had turned one of the teeth into one of her blob characters.  Edit: but I do love the little dessert cat!
Teeth at the bottom calico cat dessert at least half way up
Could have turned the teeth on it’s side and made it a taco yk?
I HAVE AN IDEA FOR THE PEACH!!🍑 You should save it for a Halloween video and turn it into a pumpkin 🎃 😁😁
LOVE LITTLE BIG FEETS
The reason for us sending the teeth is because you are the tooth fairy
3:32 "Do you know who this is?" Me: Mr. Potato head!...No? Okay
Maria. You should totally show us your new baby. I know you like to keep their name and identity private but she is still little, so could you please❤
I love the alien beanbodies they just have so much more character than the blobs or regular animals!
Moriah  make a keyboard with all your characters on it
TRY MIDDLE PART GURLLLL! IT WOULD LOOK SOOOOO GOOD on on you!!!
You could make the peach into nafulofogous and put some characters on it
can you do the big squishies someday pleaseeeeee
I would do a totoro for the teeth squishies
Please do a calendar based on your characters
When she shows the bean bodies she missed zippy who is the best
But I still love u Lol
Did anyone notice she said “stop making squishys out of body parts”??
The potato looking squshy is actually called Tato Potato. It does kinda look like gudetama tho :D
Video idea: paint a dollhouse and dedicate each room to one of your favourite caracters and sculpt the caracters that go in their corresponding rooms.then paint the furniture.
I’m thurdaaya
Can you please do one of the big ones even if it takes five parts, please
You Forgot The Sprinkle Song!!!!!!!!!!🤬🤬😡😡😡😠😠😤😤😤😫😩😭😖😣😣
Im actually in love with little big feet. I would 100% buy merch of him hes so beautiful.  Actually i really love the tooth cat too but the teeth themselves arent bad. Pretty colors at least 🤷‍♂️
She should decorate an inter room in just rainbow!!
You could also do a tooth squishy that has tooth gems that’d be cute asf
Moriah, I know you are probably busy with the new baby but will you please 🙏 make the chess set into a product? I love this video ❤
I love the alien bean body’s and Nahfalafagus!!!!! it’d be so so cool if u decorated a globe like Nahfalafagus, maybe with some bean body’s on it too!!
Idea for a tooth squishy: a literal sweet tooth. It can be covered in chocolate sauce and sprinkles.
What about the crepy candy ba
I really like the kitty! It’s so cute! ❤
Ive just turned 15 and have been watching Moriah since i was 10. Love you so much girl🫶🏻
The tooth upside down looked like the little things from my neighbor totoro
i love littl big feetssss 💜
I like the Color  scheme, of the bean body there cute he did not look bad at all!
We need a tooth family 😡😡😡😡
I have to say, your lil' cat squishy is adorable. Maybe if you do anymore tooth squishies though I was thinking you could make some sort of like little alien things where the roots of the teeth are the legs and they could be like different colors and have lil' faces! Or something. 🥰😘
patatohead
girl you can make as many Alien Bean Bodies as you want THEY’RE ADORABLE ♥️
I just want to see a series of “Sweet Teeth” where she turns them all into cute dessert covered teeth.
What about Aphmau
If you ever get those “dentures” again you should cut out a mouth hole on a squishy and put the teeth in
You could’ve made a fairy that was a tooth!!
Moriah… I know you prob don’t want to do this buuut can you do a video of squid shy makedowns where you get an inoccent cute squishy and downgrade it?
Moriah is the only person that i never get bored while watching she’s truly the best person on YouTube
please do a part 2
OMG IM EARLY YAY (tysm for making these fun videos and making us happy we all love you so much)
Do the big yellow blob please😂😅
What if Moriah uses the teeth, to make bunny blobs?? Like turn them upside down and make them bunny blobs?!
The view count goes up so fast
I love Lil, BigFeet!!!
Missed opportunity to turn the set of teeth into a clam 🥲 still loved the video tho lol 🥰❤️❤️❤️
She didn’t play the sprinkle song 😡🤬😠
The tooth bunny is cute. ❤ way to challenge yourself.
OMG HI
1 hour ago!
I am emotionally attached to littlebigfeets
A squirrel sized creature with them size 16 feet is an eldricht horror of lovecraftian proportions
you avoided all of those for good reason
NEW CHARACTER ALERT NEW CHARACTER ALERT!!!!!!!
Ughhhhh  she should’ve made the renters an animal in a lil blanket
This is a petition for moriah to get a Netflix channel we all know she deserves it
HI
Who else comes home from school and immediately looks what Moriah posts 😂😂
SEASHELL VIDEO WHERE??
Moriah your content is always the highlight of the day!
She forgot the sprinkle song! 🦷😭
Next tooth squishy: Sweet Tooth. Put a pile of whipped cream, a cherry, and sprinkles 😊
I think the teeth squishies upside down look like the totoro creatures from the studio ghibli film My Neighbor Totoro. It would have been cute to see a bigger and smaller one being painted as those little guys.
I know this is a little late but a bubble gum bubble (circle) squishy could help the teeth squishy look less creepy too
Smol big feets
Only thing I look for on fridays!
The chocolate people are called Shopkins and I get it. The pink chocolate bar is creepy.
Hi can you do another squishy makeover one like this
8:09 hmmmmmmm among us 😏😏😏😏😏 like if u agree
The tooth one was so creative!
Moriah’s videos are literally THE BEST I can watch one video 5 times because they are brilliant 😂😂🦋☀️
put two teeth the same size together, cut a big flat part on both and turn it into a plant pot on stilts and add a plant ontop
I think moriah should make a giant cat family out of all of her tooth squishies
thought for sure she’d incorporate candy in the teeth somehow 😭
Ooo the if she gets another set of teeth is it a stretch to turn it into a clam?
I wonder for the mouth squishy if you could have rounded out the teeth/gum line and turned it into either a thicc taco or small stuffed pita?..
Moriah is so creative and inspiring like I could never come up with those ideas I have been so inspired since I started watching her
best part of the teeth denture one is it couldve become an ice cream taco of sorts. but loving the rainbow
Moriah you forgot the sprinkle song😭😭😭
This is the most cursed thing you’ve ever made. Thank you.
Who remembers nahfeoulofeouagous
You should call him Little Toes
I LOVE LITTLE BIG FEETS
You should put the teeth set into the giant peach and have it eating one of the chocolate bars
I love how funny she is sometimes
It still amazes me how tf she edits her video by adding past clips like how
I think u should paint ur cat as a squishy and a painting that would be so cool
ThE rEaSoN yOu DiDnT wAnT tO fIx ThE tEeTh WaS bEcAuSe ThEy wHeRe AlReAdY pErFeCt
Omg yay it’s friday
Happy fall bean body 🔥
Lil’ Big Feet’s is honestly a new favorite of mine… 😍🤪🫶🏼
lil big feets is the best name 🦶 🦶
Imagine the teeth dentures inside the peach. A giant peach monster like the creatures from cloudy with a chance of meatballls 2.
Little big feets is so cute!
Aren’t peeps, bunnies?
Wait bc It would be so cute if she got a quilt made for her daughter's and each square was a different character of hers. For memories or whatevaaaa
You could have made the teeth into a purse squishy. Tear out the teeth and interior mouth weirdness and glue in other mini squishies (candies come to mind) inside the plain semi-circle gums and paint it all to look like an overflowing coin purse. Of course that would be a TON of work, so I appreciate that you at least made it a little more aesthetic.
No sprinkles song 💔😭
We HAVE to see more Lil Big Feets in the future! I love him. ❤
It looks like a mister potato head
I love your videos!<3
we need a drizzle song
The mouth/teeth squishy reminded me of a clam
How is your second baby?
Omg!! The mouth should have been inserted into the peach! And created a crazy large face squishy
Is it weird i though the mouth one could be made into a taco 😂
I demand to make to choclate carmel a sister that is strawberry vanilla!!!
Teeth cat peep set ? 🙏 Maybe with the teenie ones ? I love the calico kitty dessert 👏
you should paint the rest of the teeth as blobs
i honestly don’t know what to say but i just wanted to comment 😂 lol
I think you should paint a tooth squishy with rainbow pastel paint. 😊
Omg I looooove the new alien. bean body!!!!
How does she always come up with creative ideas and titles for her videos? She’s such an amazing person, there’s nothing to dislike about her.
Love the bean body alien! For the dentures I would have cut it apart, hollowed it out and glued it back together to resemble an open shell and maybe put one of the upside down tooth cats inside like the Birth of Venus but with a tooth-cat😅
I love the alien bean body sooo much ୧((〃•̀ꇴ•〃))૭⁺✧
There should be a entire family of teeth-cats, since you have so many teeths
Please make a part 2
You should've made the teeth A lil clam guy :)  The inside of the mouth has the lil clam guys face inside
Dude, when you were doing, the customize chess set I was waiting for the next video every day.
The tooth could have been TOTORO!!
Another day, another amazing Moriah video.
I watched this one hour after you made it
immediately seeing the teeth set i thought some kind of dessert since its layered . the feet maybe cut them up to look like pendants or ornaments
big feets is actually so cute🥺🥰
Oh no! I mean, I haven’t gotten to the end yet to see if she’s happy with it, but I feel like doing squishies she doesn’t like out of peer pressure just incentivizes the audience to pressure more and send in more ugly squishies.
4:47 I already made 6 alien beanbody oc's and one of them i even made out of clay!
Why didn't you add the sprinkle song when you were adding sprinkles?
honesty, watching moriah every friday has become part of my routine. Love u moriah❤
You should make some thing with just been Body’s on it
I love everything moriah makes ❤
she is asom
*Moriah is the only person who doesn't make me regret doing art* *Honestly, it is quite depressing lol*
Am I the only one that saw a dessert taco with the 👄 ? 😂
Why do I love the new mouth squishy?
I think the denture mouth thing could’ve been made into a clam if it was modified a little Like the teeth are toned down a little and the inside is made into a little creature living in the clam
uhhhhh what about the sprinkle songggggg
I love little big feet 😂
Please call the calico cat squishy Sweet Tooth
She never did the sprinkle song 😩
it''s a good day when Moriah posts!
Since Moriah needs a break here’s some easier ideas  -Moriah should make a calendar of 12 of her characters  -She should also make squishy’s based on her followers ideas
You should customize a key board and each letter would have a different character! Like and repost so Moriah can see!!
Did any Else think that The moth of teeth could’ve been a fossil from Noflafgis. 🌠🙋🏼‍♀️👄
You should have put a food with a little face on it in the mouth! Like cut out the foam and make a hole for a cute foodimal
I thought the dentures were gonna become like a teeth monster or something- I like the rainbow grilled cheese idea though Also the first one, the alien bean body, is my favorite! despite the feet, it's face is really cute and it reminds me of a squirrel and I love squirrels
Who here loves Moriah ?
Make over idea do a entire video black and white and no rainbow less copy and paste this comment so she knows !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The brain said put the teeth in the peach .... To make a new friend
sorta surprised she didn't try making the denture teeth thing into a clam or something. idk that's what i sorta got when she proped it upright. on it's back? it's side? ...with the teeth pointed up lol
I WANT A LIL BIG FEETS PLUSHHHHHHH
THE TOOTH KINDA LOOKS LIKE A SCUSIHMELOW U SHOULD MAKE IT A SERIES
I'm not the only one who immediately saw the little white guy from totoro as soon as she flipped that tooth upside down, right?
I have a good idea for the big mouth of teeth. You can make it look like it has braces on it! I think it would be a very cute idea!
Everyone spam this in comments please WE NEED THE CAT RAINBOW IN PLUSH MERCH
I really like the color scheme on the first squishy
I am wondering how those teeth would have been perfect to put in a big squishies facehole... It would have been interesting..
The dentures squishy could have eyes and feet squishy added so it looks more like a comedy toy or something goofy.
I love Little Big Feets! He's so silly!
Theee caaat i am dying 😭 soo cute
Make a tooth into a candy corn
The teeth can become Totoro’s!!
My favorite thing about Friday is that I get to watch another Moriah video!
the potato is tayto lol i ❤ u
Love these makeovers! Could you insert the teeth into one of the giant squishies? X
Potato!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 3:14
I love little big feets
I kind of wished she used the feet squishes to make those ice creams with the gumball in them 😂 I don’t know why, but for the dentures I thought of it as an oyster am I the only one who could see it as that😅 and there’s like a cute pearl inside, that has a small face😂
Tooth fairy was to obvious for the tooth squishy?? That’s what I would have done.
The mouth reminded me of the chattering teeth toy, that normally has feet........ Can someone send another mouth?
Don't think we didn't notice you forgot our sprinkle song 🤨😂
teeth could have been a carousel
If Moriah ever gets a Denture squishy again I think she should transplant it into a giant fruit and use panda buns or something similar for eyes. Then make a bunch of little animal/ people squishies that it can eat 😂
"I dont think i could have done much more" you could have put a doughnut in it
Before I watch this I was watching like horror stories so I was like I need something that is not scary.
This should be a new mini series called ‘fixing the feared’
Guys wake up the queen has posted! <3
The upside down tooth Squishies remind me of the mini My Neighbor Totoro forest spirits.    Personally I would've cut out the center of the mouth and added a tongue.
For the feet and the teeth, you could use them in place of memory foam when you help some of the more torn up squishies.
Upside down tooth is sooo a Totoro
You’re a better person than me because my first thought was to give that giant peach a set of teeth 🍑
Mr. Potatoehead vibes. 😂
Denters tocos
when I saw the neapolitan-like sweater I was surprised because I wore something very similar today:D
love the cat, but the alien is,,, a bit unsettling for me it reminds me of these pictures of the Nintendo character called Kirby where they draw him with his bean feet being shoes, and make him "take off those shoes" very traumatizing imagery (?
She should make a giant unicorn squishy for mini me
I feel like she could've turned the teeth into like a s'more thing? Or like a cream filled cookie. Just me?
AHHHHHHHHH! WHERE. IS. THE. SPRINKLE SONG??????????????? im panicking, the world is collapsing, the apocolapse is happening, and the sprinkle song ISNT PLAYING! AAUAUAUAUAUAAUUUAUUAUAGHHHHH!!!
2:07 I think the chocolate bar people's top part could be great to steal for dessert creations like sticking out of a sundae or smores! Because then it's just a normal chocolate bar without the creepy face part 😂 (Personally I like their faces, they look cute and vintage to me but I understand why they come off as creepy to others lol)
U should have put rainbow braces on the teeth
You could have made the teeth bite a donut or something!
Is anyone else wondering what happened to Opie?
These were great! I had an idea I wanted to share. You’ve become so good with clay think about adding a skull to the top of the mouth skwishy for Halloween. Knowing you did these early in the year you probably weren’t thinking in that direction. Congratulations on becoming a Mom of 2!!! 🥳🥰❤️
Omg her cat squishy iS sO cUTe!!
"Little Big Feets" is Wonderful.
Where was my sprinkle song 😂
She had been forgetting to say squishy roasting for the last like four vids
hello
I love little big feets so much
You should make bean body clan like the shadow clan and the sun clan you can make different clans
Girl you need to do this again tag me, make more teeth cats
3:24  it’s a blab!😂❤
I swear her shelves behind her get more full every Friday 😂
It's a good day when moriah posts a video
I was sure you were gonna make it into a little toothfairy
I was 1 awful late
Can you please do the GIANT UNICORNS
Moriah never disappoints. Also moriah I have an idea for one of ur tooth squishy is to make it into a tooth fairy
8:38 Studio ghibli bunny
moriah today is my birthday! ☺️
U can also use the feet as ears!
The dentures could maybe be turned into a seashell, but it’d be a lot of work to change the shape enough for the concept to translate.
Maria why do you make the rainbow out of order on that first being a body what’s going on with you😮
with the feet u could had made a gremlin
You could make an army of Totoro with those teeth you know 😂😂
Can you customise a pop figurine in your favorites character
No big squishy
I love the chicken family episode
You should do a video where you decorate all of your teeth squishies and donate them to a pediatric dentistry in case any kids are nervous at the dentist! ❤️🦷🪥
I love these vids
Let’s take a moment to appreciate how moriah NEVER fails to upload an amazing video every Friday 💕they make my day!! Squishy makeovers never get old <33
honestly i love all of them
Yes Moriah!!!!!!❤❤❤❤ can we just appreciate that Moriah is facing her fears 😂❤
THE FEET ONE IS KILLING ME HE LOOKS SOSHY ABOUT HIS FEET 💀💀
I have caught a virus from my freind, who caught it from my teacher and this cheered me up
I think if you cut the roots off the teeth squishies they kind of look like flower petals.
I can like FEEL the velvet squishies. Somehow
Not me looking through the comments looking for a big idea I can comment bomb Moriah with…yeah not me at all.
Put the teeth in the peach and make a blob with teeth. Also for the single 🦷, you can leave them 🦷 and make a sweet tooth. Decorating it with desserts
Lil Big Feets is my senpai
Hey Moriah there is a color pencil version of poscas
Turning the tooth into a cat was brilliant!! I would do all of them like that! They’d be adorable! ❤❤
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii>>>>>>Moriah.......can YOu PlEAse make OpIE into a Squishy in ur next squishy makeover please I beg youuuuuuuu
Not me thinking of hamburgers or cake after seeing the teeth (not the separate ones)
Wow 🤩 😊
Ain't that the tooth.😊
NOooOoO THE POTATOE WAS TO CUTE😭😭😭😭 ÆUGHGH
I think you could have made the last one into a purse turn it sideways with the open mouth part up and the teeth could have been like Frills or a zipper and then you could have added a little handle on top just my idea
I wonder how Opie is doing sometimes…
the teeth could have been a taco
lil big feetssssss! Yessssss
I weirdly like the mouth squishy.
What a unique bunch. I actually like the tooth
My four year old granddaughter said the first one is a s’more bear.
Please do the giant unicorn ps love you
THE TOOTH CAT IS SO CUTE
I love ❤little,big, feets 😊 they are incredible!
Girl you could have made that a taco
Moriah, u should re paint over one of ur old squishes  u made over in a older video!!  Btw I have been watching u for 3 years, u never get old!! ❤❤
Tooth dessert cat is actually very cute, wouldn't mind seeing more of those in the future if any of the other tooth shapes allow it
You missed am opportunity to have a character being eaten with the mouth squishy, the space was perfect for someone inside
you should name her cali the calico cat
I was hoping that you would turn the mouth into a clam....
I am the only one who LOVES small big feet?
Here within an hour
Love it! Could the big peach be Jerry the cherry??
i feel like there should be a "painting my jumbo squishies" series now idk maybe this could be popular
Noooo not the potato
I love all of them😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
i think if you turned the inside of the mouth into a head and the gums into sum like c o l o r it could have been a hoodie and a head- no body
Where was the sprinkle song!?!?
Those are cute. I thought you were going to put those teeth in the big peach,  and add some of those big feet. lol 🍑🤣
You should make one of the teeth a toof fairy
Missed opportunity to make the teeth a shell or some sort of dessert 🧁 it just needed some whip lol 😂
Hiiiii❤❤❤
ohHH I'm so tIrEd of her making her stOOPid alien beanbodies! uGhHhHhHHhhH  This is a joke, I love the alien beanbodies
I love her videos❤✨✨
Thanks moriah for another great video!
How could u do that color scheme on big feets😫
You could have done a clam with the mouth
Can you do a dinosaur squishy family
Little big feet is so ugly cute i lobe him
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hi I hi you said that one squishy was Gouda Tama
Litterly the best part of Friday she puts the yay in friyay
you should put the set of teeth in the giant peach and make like a cursed peach person (commented before i saw her use the set of teeth)
Give the teeth wings and create a species of tooth fairy!
Can I buy those for myself?
OMG MAKE LIL BIG FEETS MERCH PLEASEEE HE IS SOOO CUTEEEE
Moriah i really enjoyed this video i have a really cut but wierd squishy idea , so with one of your toooth squishes you coud turn it into a SWEET TOOTH like a cute lil sweet tooth! sorry for the wierd comment :)
You should turn the huge peach into the grown up version of the lost peach ( I forgot his name I want to say Jerry?) But it would be the same concept as mega chubs
I love all the squishes and the cat is so cute. Tbh I thought you are gonna turn the mouth one into some kind of desert, because that's what I see when looking at it :))
Moriah you should do a episode where you paint another part of nafalafagus
Rainbow gum!! Tastes like rainbows!!
Who else loves Moriah Elizabeth❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why didn’t you use the sprinkle song? We need the sprinkle song. Next time. You have to play to the sprinkle song in one episode to make up being not playing the sprinkle song in this episode.
I want you to do da BIG BOIS
HII
I would've turned the mouth into a cream puff. Idk something about the teeth made me think of cream spilling out of a cream puff and now I can't unthink of that.
He looks like mr potato head 😮😂❤
The teeth could have been a taco 🌮 ahah love u moriah ❤xx
PUMPKIN SEASOOOON!!!🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
Watching Moriah NEVER get old! How does she do it?
you didn't play the sprinkle song
👇Within an hour
I think the last teeth/dentures could have made a cute little taco cake. The teeth remind me of those fancy ruffled cakes
OMG I love little big feet
If you feel the need to redo the teeth dentures, you could smooth out the teeth texture and turn it into a clam with a creature hiding inside it.
For the dentures i would have turned it on its side and filled the middle bit and across the teeth with a whipped cream texture. That way i could have turned it into an ice cream sandwich type thing. Idk might just be me x
you are amazing Moria keep going with your amazing vids
Lil big feeets should be named Jerald.
Little big feet’s is so cute❤
U should've put 2 big eyes on top of the dentures it would've been so cute
BIG SQUISHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😭😭🐖
anyone remember mr. feets he came from the same video as glatic cat this video reminds me of him
Maybe just repaint all the teeth in white and donate them to ur local family/childrens denstis to kever see them again
make this the most liked comment      also love your videos mariah❤
luv your vids Moriah KEEP on succeeding!
You could have made the teeth in to the blobs   Botom part 🦷 legs  And add memory foam on top
whens the ches board coming on sale you put the ruby cube and playing cards on sale i want the ches board now (i call it the ruby cube since my little sisters name is ruby)
8:13 you missed the opportunity to make an among us  Also LOVE UR VIDS!!!
Next  comment bomb - we need you to make a dolls house.. Maybe based on your own home and give it to  your kids
Moriah should paint EVERY ONE of her characters on EVERYTHING (SHELF,FLOOR, ECT) IN HER ART ROOM!!
An idea for the big peach, you should make it like a pumpkin for Halloween 🧡
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why don't you do the BIG SQUISHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!        BIG SQUISHY!!!!!!!!!!!!
Seeing that you stayed the same after years is the best feeling ever
Man Moriah your insane your content is pure gold
YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY DO THIS AGAIN!!!!
I would love to see a giant squishy makeover video. Love your videos ❤️
It would have been funny if you added those teeth to the giant peach 😂 just roll with the cursed squishy look
The second onelooks like Totero's little friend, from My Neighbor Totoro. ❤
ALIEN FROM NOFALOFAGUS
The dentures could’ve been like a little seashell, and then on the inside you could put like a mermaid or something or just underwater nofloogians(I know I didn’t spell that right)
MORIAH YOU FORGOT TO PLSY THE SPRINKLE SONG
I got to say you could put it in a fixing things I’ve ruined episode and make it look like a dessert
I would have cut the mouth squishy apart and put the teeth biting into a donut or something.
you should of put a face on the denters!
Make pickle and dope and B op go to the angry lemon birthday party🎉❤🧁🎂.
LOVE TO SEE IT HONESTLY
You should have put feet on the points of the tooth
Little Big feetsss awww ❤
I literally love every single one ❤❤❤
Moriah!! you could possibly do something cute with the feet and tie in your adorable girls!! Like how some art projects for little babies they stamp their feet on a piece of paper with paint??
I had a idea for the denture one you could of done an animal peeping out from the inside of the dentures
You should do nesting dolls like the bean body aliens!!
2:10 the mold is from a shopkins
I actually love little big feets so much, its a whole vibe and im here for it
Can you do another claw machine video???????😊❤
Mariah you have plenty of time to unwrite what you have said you could say nothing at all or edited it out, so have you ever thought that you just use us to face your fears(video ideas)🤨?~ *DRAMATICLY in a fancy male voice* THAT YOU SUBCONSCIOUSLY USE US TO PRESSURE YOU  INTO THE VIDEO IDEAS THAT DWEP DOWN YOU TRULY WANT TO DO🧐!!~....... lol have a good day Mariah     Ps. Don't take this too seriously and hate on me🥺
I FEEL like the mouth jaw thing could had been turned into another dessert taco
I love little big feets
The teeth remind me of that song "my shiny teeth and me" those headbands and the song make me think 2000s teeth boyband?
Omg I’m a huge I mean huge fan
The tooth squishy is so beautiful  and creative
I thought the spot on the eye was great!
I hate the feel of velvet, it's so horrid it gives me goosebumps.
I love this channel sm
wow you are so talented morhia
Tooth squisy upside down could be a bunny or blob. Hands up for ecitement
1:31 the teeth ones you need a tooth fairy character and boom the teeth live in tooth land or something
U should have made the denchers a taco or dessert taco
PLEASE TURN THE GIANT PEACH INTO A MEGA-BLOB!!!!!!
If u ever get a pair of teeth again u should make it biting candy or something
Before the puff paint the first one reminds me of Mr.potato head😂
I don't know why but I thought you will transform the mouth into a taco 🌮
Moriah can you make more videos when you child choses what you draw?
the alien bean body looks like the girl who ate lima beans and turned into rainbow stripes
Moriah can you make a Gutatama squishy 💙
I think it would be fun if she made a creepy squishy with the teeth inside its mouth. Or a squishy version of operation
i was waiting for u to post for 36 minutes so thanks for posting
This girl never disappoints 💖
No Moriah, we don't make squishies "OUT OF" body parts...
Its gonna be low on the list guaran...... teeth... 🦗🦗🦗 dont worry ill show myself out
IM HEREEEEEEE ❤❤❤❤
So, I feel like for the set of teeth, an idea for next time that might work, could be standing it up on the flat back (So teeth pointing upwards), and decorate it like one of those fruit and cream over-stuffed sandwiches I've seen while watching Asian street food videos.
You might not be in love with Little Big Feets, but I would die for him
It's a bunny
Why don’t you love lil big feetsss😭😭😭🩷🩵🤍love you🩵🩷🤍
what if the teeth was a taco ??? Gums = taco shell Teeth= marshmallow Inside= pattie/ cream/ filling/ whatever u want...
You should take one of your main characters and remake them
Hi my name is Reese and I am nine years old hello and I love your channel and I have a few questions for you first question is do you like Jell-O and do you have any pets?. anyways I would love if you could put this comment in one of your videos I love you channel so much from Reese😊

I love Moriah soo much she's so funny without even trying
You should do the teeth squishies as Halloween themed, rotten teeth oozing orange and green goo on the bottom with candy and ice cream theme on top ❤ do like a Halloween set of teeth, with all a different personality and Halloween colour, one witch, one pumpkin, one Frankenstein themed 😊❤
bigfoots spirit animal
We need her annual seashell video!!! Ps. we ❤️ you Moriah
Just her being so talented and me here not even knowing how to draw a circle
Not gonna lie I saw the bunny shape from the beginning of the video too! But yes the cat is great too!
Make pickle and dope going to angry lemons, birthday party
Does anyone know what happens to opie
The dentures/teeth could’ve been some kind of taco. That’s what I saw in it when it was painted white.
8:30 when she flipped it it looked like the newjeans bunny kinda
I think it would be fun to turn a tooth into a tooth fairy
Within an hour
You could have just said the mouth is for a skittle advert: Taste the rainbow
Sprinkle song 🎵 is gone on the first tooth
could we just appreciate how much she does for us ❣️  In the hope thet you hit 10 million soon .   Love you :)
How’s Opie??
The upside-down tooth was definitely a little white Totoro! 😻
Srikle song
I absolutely love her editing!! It makes the videos 1,000,000 times better!!
go back and add tooth gems  and a grill to the teeth!!
Comment bomb Pokémon cards with moriahs characters
Yas
Hey Moriah how’s Opie I haven’t seen him is he doing ok (I think I spelled it right but I’m not sure lol)
I luv u sm moriah ur my fav YouTuber luv u sm keep up the good work and keep up squishy makeovers
I’ve been here since 2018 🙋🏼‍♀️
yay she posted
I want really want the improved teeth squishy ngl
Please do the big squishy!!
They all looked great but i would have put feet on the set of teeth like the old wind up toys x
You could have done the mouth as a burger… I guess 😁 But it’s okaaaaaay, it’s fine. We like it. We like all of them. ❤
That little potato should've been Mr. Potato. But I looks nice!
you could sell those squshy feet on foot finder
Woops forgot h
FOR FREE!? 2:03  -SOCKSFOR1
Omg yay it’s my first time I have gotten here within the first hour
SASQUATCH SQUISHY
cool video like all of yours
Decreepifying. ADD IT TO THE LIST
Moriah is the first person I watch after school on Friday
For the dentures, something made me think of a cream puff. First thing that came to mind when I saw the teeth was definitely a bunny family, which turned into a very cute calico :) The designs were definitely on brand, and I can see them all being in Nahfalafagus
Hate is a strong word….  But it’s the right one
thank u
Little Big Feets is my fav alain been body
Moria:on that little hole😂
Omg yess❤ I've never realised how much I wanted this video ❤
yayy wake up from ur sleep she posted again 👏👏👏👏👏👏
I mean I'm surprised you didn't find away to make the dentures into some type of desert.
Idea for the individual teeth: SweetTooth Collection. Every tooth is decorated like a sweet (lollypop swirl, cupcake, ice cream etc)
Sorry but I feel the need to point this out, the cat needs a tail
yay! do: more from the hopeless bin
u should make the teeth into blobs
Hey Moriah can u plz do a video where u make the planet nofofogus map ❤❤❤
I LOVE THE BEAN BODY LITTLE BIG FEETS HE’S SO FREAKING ADORABLE ❤
moriah give the mouth one to minnie me to play with and let her abuse it 😭
lil' big feets <3 <3 <3
Ahhh I thought you were going to combine the teeth with the chocolate so that it would look like the teeth were biting on a piece of chocolate
Can you do a video with your new born baby 🍼🐥🍼🐥🍼🐥🍼
wow these turned out great, i wish you'd gone with blue in the eyes for the alien bean body cause that would have tied it together well.
OMG ITS BEEN SO LONG- I think i summoned the entire fnaf fandom
YAY WAKE UP QUEEN POSTED
Put the big teeth in the big peach and add some ears and eyes. It can go with weird little big feet and make a new weird planet
Hmmm could the giant peach maybe become a cute pumpkin character for Halloween?
Hi today is my birthday  your the best🎉
you should use a tooth one and make a fairy - a tooth fairy lol
she's never boring! I can't stop watching her!
“I Am sMiliNg” 😂 I love you moriah ❤❤❤
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG YOU R MY FAV YOUTUBERRRRRR UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH SOOOOO AWESOMEREEE EEE
We need a part 2!
moriah you need to do your annual seashell painting vid!!!! <3
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
When I saw the teeth, the first thing I thought was "taco" where the teeth on either side of the mouth were lettuce or other toppings, then the inside piece you could put like meat, cheese, etc.
why do i kinda love the chocolate bar people squishies 😂
Moriah makes all of us happy. Or at least me. Let’s just take a second to appreciate her and her lovely personality❤
Oh hey Moriah!I was wondering,you know that green slime thing from a show? I was wondering could you design it?See you next week,bye!
For your next idea to doo with the teeth squishes.. You could turn them someway into a tiara.. (The bencher one also looks like a dessert, like a sweet version of a taco or a macaron, at some parts..)
You told me do you have question and I Raised my hand and you said PUT YOUR HAND DOWN
moriah makes me feel like im in her art studio
I don’t know if she knows this but she had a chance to make mr potato with the feet guy
Why do I kinda like the last one 💀 it's funky. I was expecting you to turn it into a cake but keeping it as it is feels refreshing and again- funky. I kinda dig it 😂
Sea shell please
"this is an alien bean body🤪" Me: "Not again 🤦🏽‍♀️"
I’m sick right now and watching Moriah makes my mood better :)
11:04 clam
i like little big feets the bestttt 😛
I would have stuck the teeth in the the peach….a Halloween monster peach.
how the heck am i so early this week-
New beanbody next week.
We love you and your videos morih ❤❤  Ps sorry if spelled you name wrong
YOU SHOLD HAVE MADE THE TEETH A CLAM!
Reply “MEH!” And more if u think she should paint da big squishies
You could of made the teeth into a layered cake or a burger
Now make a tooth cat family
I am a bit early I guess…
i vividly remember having one of those pink chocolate bar squishies when i was kid LOL
The dentures could be turned into a dessert taco pretty easily I think!
I love her videos!
Moriah slays once again today ❤
tooth could easily become a totoro sprite, they look like bunnies too
You should do another art things to do when your bored
Hey everyone it's my birthday today🎉

I’m running out of ideas so you should do another art things to do when your bored
Today for homeschool I had to read an article about teeth-   *and I love chocolate* 😃
I feel like alien bean body is going to be very popular
I would have turned the dentures into a burger 🍔
Keep up the good work! ❤ #bestartistiknow❤

Taste the Rainbow? 😜

Omg I love you so much and little big feetz is defo my new fav character you have created 😍💕💗❤❤
I love every single video she makes😂❤
Grew up watching her and I’ll never stop watching no matter how old I get 🥹
The mouth of teeth could be a clam slightly a jar
Moriah I’ve been watching you for no joke 5 years (💀) and I just gotta say your thumbnail skills ARE SO GOOD 😻😻
You could've made the set of teeth a cake
There are so many other YouTubers that you grow out of but I'm still here watching Moriah since 2019. She's the best and never gets old.
hi moriah ive been a fan scince you stared i love you videos you never fail to make me smile i love you videos and you are so talened
Moriah hey can you please paint your shelfs for us 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢+COMMENT BOMB 💣
So erly
As soon as I saw squishy makeovers… 😁
when i saw the teeth squishy- it really reminded me of a clam with a cute pearl inside with a happy face, but i love the randomness of rainbow grilled cheese
i wouldve made the dentures a weird morbid snail or hermit crab lolol
With the mouth squishy, I would've chopped off the teeth and turned it into a taco.
11:18   You could make a (dessert) taco out of the denture.
Please do more baking vids!!!!!
Moriah should make characters she already in create this book into squishys
earlyyy!
Moriah should do a bear foot also you didn't do a chocolate bar! 🦄
Moriah you could have made the mouth into a clam
Ok but why do I really like the mouth one. 😂
If she turned the teeth sideways it could have been some sort of dessert or taco thing 🤷‍♀️
Oh so I love your videos and I think of you as an Idol
I’m here for the beanbodies
NAME THE CAT MARSHMELLOW!!!❤❤❤❤
Congrats on the baby!!!
It kinda looks like a alien squirrel
34 mins ago and we have 1.3k comments cool not surprised
COMMENTS* also PROUD❤
Sorry, usually I don’t comment on these kinds of things, but stop making alien bean bodies are too many, and it is a obsession now, so just stop
hi MY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Little Big Feets!
I think you should do more teeth! Maybe a different animal/dessert for each one and you call them a sweet tooth collection. <3
Hi😊😊😊😊😊
DIS GIRL POSTED THIS 34 MINUTES AGO AND GOT 1.3k COMENTS?!?!?!😊
for the dentures u could have done some of ur characters popping out of the mouth
Hey Moriah, thanks for being one of the few things I can listen to when I have migraines. It helps take my mind off the pain
I think i see a new character Chubby the alien bean bod with extremely oversized feet
Moriah should turn the giant peach squishy into the Jerry the cherry!!! 😆
Teeth 😂😂
She didn’t play the sprinkle song 😢😢😢
You could've cut a chunk out of the giant peach then  put the denshers inside of it  then after you could have given it really small eyes
Lol
Just from the title and thumbnail, I know this will be a good one   And after watching it I was right
I 100% expected to hate the feets one and to my great surprise I think it's adorable!!!! I just kept thinking of those dessert mouse rabbit things. Can't remember the name
Glad you're facing your fears Don't be scared to do certain squishys
but who cares lol
Love your work moriah!❤ By the way you forgot the sprinkle song 😂 just kidding it’s not a big deal!
I'm calling it now: the dentures are going to be in the bottom 3 in the ranking video
Taste the rainbow 😂
Love the teeth!  😂  you know what would have been cool?  A grill.  You know, like braces, but with gold and diamonds?
lol the potato is tayto potato
She should do painting on rubber ducks!!
For the teeth you could do them as candy lime sweet tooth
Paint barbie dreamhouse or else .... 🗡
nice i was just thinking about commenting but btw i love your videos so much!! i think that you should Make More Squishy Makeovers i have been watching All of Your Playlists i really Love You And i Hope You Make More Good Videos!! <3
😭 I’m so sad you didn’t do the tooth fairy with the tooth! 🦷 There’s a cute one in the sims (a tooth with wings and a wand). The kitty is really cute though! 🥰
I love you, Me
THIS IS THE EARLIEST IVE EVER BEEN TO YOUR VODEOS WOO HOO
Can we just take some time to appreciate moriah's effort far us ❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤😊❤
💔
I'm supposed she didn't of making a sweet tooth.
Guys we need to remind her to do the summer seashell videooooo
I thought the teeth squishy could be turned into a taco, just me?
Next week you should so a big one! PLEASE! I WILL GET EVERYONE IN THIS UNIVERSE TO SUBSCRIBE TO YOU!
you know it’s a good day when moriah posts!❤❤🎉
For the teeth if you painted the out side blue and then used the teeth indents as clouds you could have a side view or mirrored squishy of a storm or hurricane or maybe the ocean. That would be pretty cool.
33 mins ago
could have made wings out of the feet just saying
im in love with little big feets, please make little big feets plushies
The cat's a sweet tooth
❤
It looks like me potato head right?🥔5:03
I feel like the teeth/dentures squishy would've made a nice purse
Same and Moriah is so pretty even being pregnant
Lil big feetSsS needs a plushie
Please make all the bean bodies
THERES A SERIOUS THUNDERSTORM TODAY BUT ITS ALL BETTER WITH A NEW SQYISHAY VIDEOOOO YAAA
Moriah, today is my birthday, and it would make my day if you did this idea, Make custom Squishies for both mini me's, good idea right?
Am I the only one that actually likes the mouth tooth squishy and how it turned out 😭❤️
You could turn some of your squishys that are like unfoodable/unanimable into blobs like cut them into a shape paint it and turn it into a blob
AHHHH IM KINDS EARLYYY ILYYYY
The feet and the gudetama squishes could actually make the perfect mr potato head squishy 😭 4:44
The first one is adoravle
I can believe 32 minutes ago <3  It’s my birthday this weekend ❤️
What if you shoved the set of teeth into the big unicorn?
I think a literal tooth fairy could be cute
Amazing love it 😍
With the mouth squish I feel like if you sanded it down and cut out some of the middle it could be and opened clam sea shell
you should make a tooth fairy
I have one of your unicorn squishies and I don't know how to describe it to you but it's the one that is standing on all fours
Yes another video I look forward to your videos every Friday!! 🩷🩷🩷
I would've made the teeth into a cake 😂😂
She should’ve made the first one into Mr potato head 😂 Great video moriah
You slay queen
love it
I have been waiting your video for so long now thank you
I LOVE LITTLE BIG FEETS WE NEED A PLUSH NOW
HERE WITHIN AN A HOUR 👇
Okay the tooth cat is freaking adorable tho 😭 I would love to see a whole family of teeth creatures out of the other squishies! It gives off peep and blob vibes and I love it
Please make a squishy of yourself
Who loves to watch moriah after school  *Edit* it's okay if you don't go to school
since you have so many big squishies, how about making a mega squishy? like made of several different squishies, or a frankensquishy, or something along those lines
I love ur videos really cool on the teeth eating rainbow cheese it would be so cool if u added rainbow braces with it great job on the videos byee
I’m finally here within a hour😅
Literally every comment: CaN wE  tAkE a MoMmEnT aNd rEaLiZe hOw mUcH sHe dOeS fOr uS? Like it’s true but GOSH
I wanted to see her decorate the velvet squishy 😔
Squishy 1: Why not call it the blue foot squirrel?
The tooth with the sunglasses looks kind of like one of those deformed strawberries lol
Hi😊
Hi
Quick Question Moriah, WHERES OPIE WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM??
Wow they are both amazing! I guess moriah can get creative with the squishies she’s avoiding! I love how she always uses rainbow! Especially the pastels!
Honestly you did a very good job at saving those poor unfortunate souls from themselves
Hi
I think it would have been cute to add rainbow braces to the teeth to tie into the rainbow inside
Hi
The individual teeth would make a cute Easter video
Idk don't ask
you should have cut the teeth of and made it an ice cream sandwich but its wayyyyyyyyyyyy better than before
Next time you do this can you please try and do the peach
The cat is the mom of chubs and tiger!
Wowowowowow
Lil' Big Feets is so precious
The tooth turned up side down made me think of a small Totoro 🤍
Hi
Hi
I’ve been watching her since I was 5 and I’m 13 now who cares if she’s Childesh she never gets old
you are so so so good
The intro that I wait for every Friday🩵🤍🍔
Hih
Hi
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!!!!  I totally want Sprinkles the Cat as a plushie!!!!  I LOVE HER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YESS Ijust love when Moriah uploads
Hi
You should make a tooth fairy squishy!! It would be so cute (maybe add in animal features for even more cuteness)
Hi
Hi😊hihi😊
what if you made the mouth into a clam with a cute little pearl sticking out
28 min gang  👇
She missed the tail on the desert cat
Stop spamming ideas !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The dentures /mouth teeth could’ve been turned into a icecream sandwich Or two upside down cupcakes squished together or a cookie sandwich with a filling in the middle
Moriah it’s not Gudetama it’s Tayto Potato!!  🥔
My 9 year old daughter Sarah is desperate to send you a letter but apparently you're not accepting post anymore and she is kinda gutted. I am too as I am also a fan now lol hope you and minier me are doing well xx
MR POTATO HEAD 4:55
Literally, the first one looks like Mr Potato head
the mouth could have been a clam
Maybe the tooth animals can be from a different planet then the blobs
I 🩷 lil big feetss
Little big feet needs to put those grippers away
Sorry this was posted half an hour ago and it's already got so many likes and views hahah moriah you're amazing and when I'm older I want to be just like you!
#most early I’ve ever been lol
For the chattering teeth i have an idea. If you ever come across another one of those or want to redo it. Heres an idea, find a small squishy smaller than the teeth, that can be a little jester/jokster that can be placed on top of the teeth and glued. Maybe its a jokster/jester character that plays music, plays pranks on the characters, and makes them laugh. That might be an unlikely idea but its worth a shot. Love your videos ☺️💐🌈
DAY 1 OF ASKING MORIAH TO MAKE A PUZZLE AND SELL IT PLS PLS PLS
For the teeth, I would have tried to make it into a shell ice cream, or maybe a taco, but it might have been difficult to do
Sorry I meant Moriah
You could've made the dentures into a Taco with adding some squishy parts that look like salad or so.then the teeth could've been beans or meat!
The upside down tooth squishy actually reminded me of :"D
wait, count " little big feets" toes are there 5 or 6?
PLEASE DO SOME BIG SQUISHIES
bro i hate my self becaues i got my food a dropy my foooooooooooodddddddddddddddd
why everyone in the comments sound liek bots💀💀💀
I love Morahia I hope I get to paint like her some day
The only ARTYOUTUBER that is genuinely relatable,funny and ENTERTAINING-
Moriah never fails to inspire me
How long is a normal for without editing?
Early
@Fayeperry
OK HEAR ME OUT- collab with NerdECrafter to make sine spooky fun designs using the teeth for a Halloween-themed squishy! If anyone could make that work, it's you two!
Im obsessed with the sprinkles and Caramel drizzle on the cat squishy! So cuteeee
Do you Guys know the little white Totoro in 'My Neighbour Totoro'? When Moriah flipped that Tooth i instantly saw the little Totoro in there🙈 Would be quite a cute Squishy!
the upside down teeth look like tiny totoros 😭
Who had there hand up to ask a question 😂
Yas
Now, these makeovers are scientific evidence that Moriah is like the master of art and fun🤩
I love your creativity so much
HIIII
I love the cat 😻🐱
You could make a tooth fairy out of the teeth squishies? Add wings and other body parts from gracious donors? Maybe a little coin? A pouch for the Mini Me’s when they starting getting big girl teeth?
I love your vidss
All YouTubers tell us to subscribe when Mariah not only dosent say that she also thanks us a lot for watching ❤😂
Maria. You are so inspiring.😄
You could make the peach into a  fruit from the planet you created (I don't know how to spell it)
Yaaaas moriah ❤❤
the teeth- mouth thing, kinda looks like a burrito if u lay it on its back, the teeth could've been tomato and lettuce or something.

My favorite series after baking is back!! The tooth cat is EVERYTHING! I'd love to see more!
Yay!!!! More squish videos :) Hope everything is going great with the new baby!!
She should makeover a donor squishy
Sprinkle song?
Hey Moriah such a surprise because this Friday its my Birthday so its like a present lol bye
I actually LOVE the tooth cat. You should make more with all the teeth you've got😻🦷❤
I have been watching you for  11 years I love you!
I read the title and knee this was gonna be CHAOTIC😭😭
you could've turned the teeth into a purse!!
Why didn’t you use the sprinkle Song when you painted the cat
WHY DO I LOVE LITTLE BIG FEETS
👁️ 👄 👁️ Taking. Notes… on making alien bean bodies 📝  So much fun!! As usual! LOVE Moriah’s vids!! 🥰
Moriah, a SWEET TOOTH. Like an ice cream tooth or fruit or something. C'MON.
Moriah is the BEST artist
can you please make a family of cats <3
25 mins ago early ❤❤
For the big teeth u should’ve made it into a cake
❤❤❤
Here early!!! I love you sm and I think that you do soooo much for us!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Is it just me or does the upside-down tooth silhouette remind you of Totoro? 🤣
I personally really like Big Feet's design! The colours suit him rlly well.
The teeth reminded me of a hard shell taco...
We are a lil big feets loving hiz-house 🗣️💯💯💯🔥☄️☄️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯
Who else randomly found her channel AND NOW ABSOLUTLY LOVES IT❤❤❤❤❤😊🎉😂
Moriah, can you please do another bake with Me video? Thanks!

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I think we can all agree that moriah is the best artist ever❤❤❤ also next time plsssssssss moriah I really want to meet the new baby and also can you plssssssss do the big squishy like the peach❤ love you so much!❤❤❤
the cat and bean body are so cute
Hi
She should have put the teeth inside of another squishy and made it really smiley haha
Ake the teeth into tooth fairy’s but adding wings to them and then you can make it a collection of tooth fairy’s
She could have made Audrey 2 plant
Here within 30mins 🎉
The denture squishy looks like a pastry of some kind!
I’m still in school and my art teachers r horrible I need youuu!! Ur amazing!!
Hey girl great video
Moriah never gets old and I love watching every single one
Looking at the feet my first thought was making them into petals, seemed difficult to pull off but I like the final result. The wittle kitty is so adorable and surprisingly the teeth looked a lot better... to look at xD My first thought was like a clam with a little ecosystem in it or something but no doubt that would've been time consuming. Respect for braving these *ahem* squishies!
I’m SO TIRED OF THESE ALIEN BEAN BODYS ugh. /jk. :)
love squishy makeovers
The tooth squishy turned out so cute! ☺It was a very creative way of interpreting the shape of that squishy. 💖
Again yelling to my grandma that " THERE'S A NEW SQUISHY LADY!! "
Make a yearbook please 🥺
What if you made a giant unicorn tooth fairy?
I love the effort you put into these even though you didn’t want to do! I look up to so much Moriah love you ❤
Get your 1 hour early ticket here 👇
I feel like you should've made the set of teeth at taco and then just and other squishes in the mix for meat and lettuce ext.
the tooth squishy upside down looks like Totorro
the tooth upside down kind of looks like those little guys from Totoro
no sprinkle song?
You could make the teeth nafalafagan people and the one with a crown could be tue king or queen
I’m late 😢
I love you
20mins I love you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ so much
When you turn the tooth upside down it’s literally totoro!!
Summmer seashell video needs to happen
I've been watching this channel since Sunmer 2018!
Early to her videos! Love Moriah ❤
These videos I can watch over and over and not get bored. I look forward to every Friday for this!
Sprinkle song?😭
You probably could’ve turned the teeth on the side and turned it into a taco or something! Just an idea that I thought of after seeing the view of it at 11:10
Omg I have been waiting for this type video for a long time!
Hi
You could do a sweet tooth theme with your remaining tooth squishies by using them as a canvas to paint a bunch of dessert/candy patterns on them!
The new thumbnail style is pretty cool
I love it 11:41
I kinda want her to make a high school year book out of her characters with titles like prom Queen and King and class clown (copy please)
The bunny looks like the bunny from Totoro before you put the added the brown spots on it
😊😊
You should have put a donut in the mouth and made it eating it!! ❤
YAAAAASSSSSSS! The feet squishies! Finally! Thank you, Moriah!
I forgot the name of the nefalugian dude on your claw machine.But that tooth squishy shape would have suited her.
me just watching the like button go up as I'm watching Moriah
Your co0ole
I CANT BELIEVE HOW EARLY I AMM OMGG!!! I love your vids smmm
AIGGH!!!! I’m finally early!!! I love your videos Moriah and so does my bestie . Thank you for always doing your best and please continue to do your best ❤
I almost expected you to paint the tooth to have a cavity that was oozing sprinkles/rainbow
She could have put braces with smiley faces on the teeth of the dentures squishy
saw the tooth and was like there's no way moriah can turn this into anything cool... A CAT!!! A CUTE LITTLE KITTY??? How does she come up with these ideas 😍😍
I love Mariah I watched her 4+ years and I know that whenever she paints or puts sprinkles on squishy or other things she always puts the sprinkle song when she's painting or putting on the sprinkles and she forgot the sprinkle song when she painted the sprinkles on the cat🥲🥲🥲🥲
The mouth should have been turned into a shell and the top teeth the waves and the bottom teeth the sand and the middle part under the sea with fish and coral..
I love cats
In the next Squishy Makeover she should just paint some of her biggest squishies!
20 MINS AGOOOOOOOO
1:15 at Halloween you should make it a pumpkin !
Moriah should make the teeth into desserts and call them "sweet tooth"
I would like to make a partion for Moriah to make candles
PUT ALL OF YOUR TEETH TOGETHER AND ADD BRACES AND MAKE A GIANT SET OF TEETH
Never been this early. On lunch...perfect timing!
3:41 I have that creepy mouse one- o-o
I think that Moriah should make a Rainbow the Cat Plush. Like this if you would agree. 😀
Whenever I see a Moriah Elizabeth video: 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄🤩🤩🥰🥳🥳🥳🥳
hi moriah
The cat is now a sweet tooth
You should’ve made the teeth/ mouth / dentures a taco
am i the only one that thinks small big feets is ADORABLE?
Am I the only one who comes back every single Friday to watch Moriah Elizabeth she is the best YouTuber in the world love her👏👏👏👏
Actually, the jaw could have been a clam
Pls make this a series
I love little big feets, he is so cute ❤
ok but a set of the tooth cats... would be so cute
Moriah you should make a human body out of all the body parts squishies you have been sent!
*W H E R E  W A S  T H E  S P R I N K L E  S O N G*
FINALLY, AFTER YEARS OF BEING A MORIAH FAN, I FINALLY GOT HERE SEMI EARLIER!!!
u might wanna do another thumbnail also. i didnt know it was a squishy makeover
Hello Moriah ♥️
I love her so much I wish she would see this comment because she is soooo amazing and awesome! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
For the teeth one you should of done a blob trapped in the teeth. That would be a really cool idea.❤
You could’ve turned the teeth into a taco or something
The set of teeth give me a visceral feeling of primal discomfort and I have no idea why.
That was the opportunity for a literal sweet tooth! XD
Claim your here within a hour ticket 🏆
ᒪᑌᐯ ᑌ
Where do you get your paint?!
Oh  Moriah we are soo sorry for comment bombing you to do this XD
Little big feet has to be my new favorite character EVER I love him so much
Hello queen!!!!!!
Can you please turn more teeth into animals?? It was soooooo cute! Also, can you make a dollhouse with all of your characters for your children?
For the giant mouth/ teeth at the end, if you have a second squishy of it or want to redeem it, maybe turn it on its side and make it into a purse or a stuffed bread/ sandwich or sweet sandwich like Japanese strawberry with whipped cream sandwich!
We got spoilers on whos at the botom of the list, litle big feets
SHE SKIPPED SPRINKLE SONG
Moriah please do this again
Hii moriah I love your vids please give me a shout out
I ❤ your video

It looks like small big footsss is walking because he needed a left foot like he’s creeping around the forest😂😂
I’ve been wanting you to do this vid THANK YOU SO MUCH 😊❤
I know what you should paint next You should paint a cereal box and make your on cereal.
Indeervidual  teeth turned upside down look like little totoro s the dentures could have been a marshmallow filled biscuits with cream....
Please do the big squishy
Do tiger and Chubbs have a baby sister❤
Love little big feets <3
I was hoping to see you glue another squishy on top of the set of teeth to make a really strange squishy with an abnormally large mouth
CC Kitty is the name I suggest.... Chocolate Caramel kitty.
i actually rlly like the teeth for some reason
Who else thinks us fan should come up with a name for ourselves?
MORIAH IS THE BEST AND YOU CANT TELL ME OTHERWISE
We got a theth and a thes

Tooth can be carrots Add the huge teeth to the PEACH
you could have done mr potato head
moriah should do a calendar with all her characters  👇
Here's an idea for the peach: Cinderella's pumpkin carriage.
I adore little big feets
I dont want to be mean but like where's the sprinkle song?!
Yay another Bean body! Love the the tooth kitten best! I saw the mouth and instantly thought of Audrey 2 from "Little Shop of Horrors" (which as a baby plant, was cute! That was the point) but I like your rainbow version too!

15 Min chec :)
Moriah Elizabeth Fans!    👇
Hi love your vids always inspire me to do art on my channel
Years ago, I used to eagerly rush home every friday after school just to watch moriah. Now, in my fourth year of high school, your videos suddenly popped into my mind. Watching them makes me feel like a kid again :((
Lil Big Feets is so silly lookin, i love him❤❤❤
Moriah should make a video where she trys to "Fix" all of the donor squishes
Okay, but Moriah is an icon for doing all of this every week while having a (two) child(ren), like seriously I could NEVER
Make a tooth into a cute tooth fairy that’s an actual tooth
Can you PLEASE do a big squishy next!!!!!
Moriah is something else posting videos with a newborn and  toddler seems like one heck of a job
Feels illegal to be finally early 💀💀💀             Usually i m years late....... 😢😢😢😅😅😅
I wish Moriah was my art teacher ❤
I’ve got excited for these videos every Friday for yearsssss ❤️
If you do another one of the mouth with the teeth you could do a cream filled pastry instead of teeth
I’m so glad you are doing this
OMG i love calico cats, thank you for make days  better
OMG YOU COULD HAVE MADE THE TEETH A CLAM WITH A PEARL OR SOMETHING INSIDE
Hello, greetings from Austria. I like your creations. Do you have any ideas for Halloween yet? Maybe you can use your teeth again. . . and maybe even your feet again. A little horror witch with an unusual cauldron would be something, but I'm sure you can think of something better.
I love you vid
Oh NOW you notice the tooth bunny thing
The upside down tooth looks like the little Totoro forest spirits
Hi
Early gang: ✋
Lil big feets is beautiful
Who else thinks that Moriah is the most creative person ever!?
Do the big squishies!
It’s a monstrosity😂
earleahh
I look forward to next friday
YESS THE ALIEN BEENS ARE BACKKKK
Hey Moriah! I haven’t finished the video, but the squishy at 3:12 isn’t actually Gudetama, although that was a really good guess. It’s actually not a Sanrio character at all and is a potato from the brand Smoko, so your initial guess of a potato was correct!
moriah should make a giant unicorn with teeth and feet while holding chocolate and a velvet squishy
Ohh I LOOOVE this idea! Appreciate you Moriah, the things you do for our entertainment.
I thought she would’ve turned the teeth into an ice cream sandwich but love you moriah
Just 14 m8ns go and already has like 900 comments😂❤Btw pls pin?
the teeth 💀
The only thing I could see the teeth/dentures changing into was a weirdly shaped macaron
I love how you improvised with the tooth squishy with turning it upside down! When I saw that shape, I saw so many different animal possibilities! You should customize more tooth squishies using that technique❤❤❤
Why don’t you use the teeth as donors? You can just cut needed shapes from them.
Please put your chess set on your store
I love your vidsss. you'er a REALYYY good artist!!!!!!!!
New character alert!!!😂😀
Btw i like all of them moriah dont hate your sgiesies (btw sorry if i spelt somting rong its i come out ee onoter land /country )
Please customize a monopoly board it would be so cool and unique ❤
I think with the set of teeth she could’ve done like decorative braces or like instead of the actual brackets as like strawberries or bunnies or something I don’t know lol love your videos
The single tooth one came out really well. I saw a bunny or cat head :) or if you had it the other way the ears become legs if you get what i mean 😅
I would love to see more videos like this!
I swear just seeing Shelly, and Derp and Eustas in the background never gets old 😅😂
She’s so close to 10mill let’s get her there
I think people send you teeth because you have a sweet-tooth ;)!
Maybe you can make a whole family of cat out of the teeth?
can we just appreciate
The choppers give me skittles vibes. Taste the rainbow 🌈 🎉
✨bean body✨ Also- I would use the tooth squishys to put in the fursuits mouth-
How do you not add the sprinkles song!!!😡😡😡😡
“Look for this one at the end of the year ranking video” SENT ME
I love the dessert calico dessert cat also you should make a naffalafugus book of all the adventures of the bean bodies. Also I love your videos
You didn’t do the sprinkle song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I freaking love lil big feet’s he is now my favorite bean body alien, right now I have made my decision
It’s ban ban
The fact she already has almost 1k comments in 7 mins
he is amazing
Moriah! The spinke song you forgot it when you did the tooth cat😭😭❤️
Moriah should have givin the feet to muscle chicken
For little big feets, i just put em all together and i was like..lifees, liffies? Liffees..idk how to write it but it sounds cute
Hi Moriah, I've been watching your videos for a very long time now and I've been subscribed for a long time as well,  And whenever you post it lights up my day more than opening Christmas gifts❤, And I know you won't pin this but I wait every day till Friday for you too post I will never forget the time you post a video,❤ You're my most favorite youtuber ever!!❤
Tail
We love u Moriah! Ty for this! ❤
11:41 love it
Missed opportunity to paint some tiny toenails!
I thought for sure those big teeth were going to go into the unicorn as it's mouth.  😂😂😂
Yay! She finally uploaded! I love her videos ❤
Early! Love you moriah! ❤❤❤
I was super bummed to see you did not make the teeth into characters. Make the set the momma and all the single teeth her kiddos and have different colors of braces or make them from your planet and have colorful cavities
Had a rough day some Moriah is exactly what i needed i was so happy when i saw this video in the subscription box
Petition for Moriah to do the biggest squishy possible by combining a bunch       |   V
Tbh I’m kinda shook that you DON’T like the chocolate bar people lol they seem like something that’d be right up your alley. N there’s multiple, so you can make a whole family- which is another thing that you really enjoy doing with your squishy makeovers lmaoo so ya, you not only just generally not liking them, but actively literally avoiding them….. that’s kinda crazy to me 😅😅
She should make a calico cat named Cherry 🍒 and have a GIANT cherry on her head
The dentists are going ham rn
I love the cat!!😊
Love it 😊
An upside down tooth squishy looks like the small white and blue Totoros 🥺😍
OMG IM 12 MINUTES LATE I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS EARLY!
she gives me so much nostalgia its a nice break from life every friday❤
The shopkin will haunt me in my sleep...
for the teeth i was thinking like maybe a cake sort of?
haha wouldve been cool if you made the mouth like biting a donut
Requesting a mini squishy mobile hanger ❤️
Moriah is so creative! She is truly my YouTube inspiration
Turn- the tooth squishy into like- a weird looking alien ship- for the bean body aliens
Sadly, I like the dentures one😂
Watch big feets become a plushie
👏🌟MORE🌟👏BAKING🌟👏  ⬇ ⬇  ⬇
Hi i'm a huge fan of your videos! I have a few ideas too. 1) You could make mini me and new baby matching screen printed clothing. 2) You could decorate some baby toys for new baby. I hope you and your family are safe and happy from Eloise♡
I already know the 2 losers of the year on the ranking: These FREAKING STUPID TEETH on the bottom and the FREAKING UGLY HAT following after them.
Series idea: painting all of the teeth as different desserts.. essentially a “sweet tooth” or sweet teeth.
Moriah i NEED you to do the big peach plsssss
LOVE YOU MORIAH AND YOUR CHANIL LOVE LOVE
I tried to do my own squishy makeover and it turned out pretty good but i forgot to sand it so the whole thing peeled off😂😢
She missed the sprinkle song for the calico cat!!!
make a squishy crown with all the teeth  week 6 of asking to take all bread slice squishies and making them into a loaf of bread
I WISH SHE COULD MAKE A SQUISHY CHAERACTER BASED ON HER, FOR EXAMPLE BROWN HAIRED BROWN EYES PALE SKINED CHARACTER!<3
the teeth could be little bunnies if turned upside down and the teeth set could be a cake maybe? edit: waitt lol she actually saw it too haha
YOU FORGOT THE SPRINKLE SONG
Biggest fan in the universe ❤
I JUST LOVE UR SQUISHY MAKEOVERS!!!!
You should name him fur foot 😺
Claim ur hour early ticket here
U make me so happy I love watch ur vids ur vids make my day better and better I love them all
big feets is actually adorable!!
You should make a set oh sweet tooth
Such a good video! 💚
i would NEVER thank of turning a tooth into a cat or buuny😂
I freaking love that cat so much! Please bring her back!
Who else randomly found Moriah and loves the channel no
ANNUAL SEA SHELL PAINTING VIDEO!!!!! WE NEED IT!!
I think you should name the alien bean body Feetsies 😂❤
t
Where is the tail!! 😢
AYYY
Omgg slayy 11 minutes love you and minis so much xx😊
Lil' Big Feets came out so cute! Love you Moriah!
Ily and ur vids❤
Try to do a de makeover make them look worse 😂 ❤
You know the pterodactyl mochi you made but didn't like too much, well you could use that pterodactyl squishy you were given into a better version and because you didn't hate indigo anymore and your mochi pterodactyl looked dark blue you could make it an indigo pterodactyl and Pickle's friend and you could order that squishy you painted pickle with to make pickled pink.
You should turn a tooth in to a among us character
I have an idea for the chocolate bars cut off the limbs and make the wrappers themed off of you're characters for an example with pickle you could paint it pickle green and add the colorful spots and make a logo!(only if you want to of course just thought it'd be cool)
The tooth is a baby totoro!!!!
WE LOVE YOU ME!!
It looks more like a bunny lol
MORIAH!!
Lil big feets is my fave
That giant peach could be a pumpkin! 🎃
I have Derp and I don’t know what to feed him
I love you so much Moriah❤ I have a request it’s kink of hard thigh but if you don’t want to you don’t have to but can you make a small squishy out of memory foam ❤
The first one at the start looks like Mr potato head
Oh I can’t understand this grilled cheese Obama sandwich
She looks so cute ☺️ GOD bless hope you and the babies are doing good

Did you know they made a pastel rainbow soft matte tulip paint set? Also you should name it small feetzz
Wow i posted a squishy makeover yesterday fun coincidence
Moriah, I would never notice the background changing if you didn’t point it out 😆
Only people that didn't come From tiktok can like it
You should make one of the teeth into a literal tooth fairy. That would be fun.

Watching Moriah on Friday is now a tradition for me lol 😂
yayyyy I love you moriah
this is the best friday of the start of school i needed this thanks queen
I love your vids I have been a fan since you started
Hey Moriah, I know your probably never going to see this but I really wanted to thank you.  I got your create this book 2 a few years back when I was still young, and it was the first time I ever tried at art, it was the thing that got my passion ignited. I specifically remember doing the page where it said to combine two animals into one, and it was the first drawing I ever did with a pencil outline before the actual outline, and it was the first drawing I did where I actually tried and it changed EVERYTHING. I know it probably was rough at the time, but I remember being so proud of this little drawing I did. Now I've been steadily improving my art, and I've found it's one of my true passions, its one of things that makes me who I am. I love art, everything about it. It was the same thing with the tools, I never would have thought to get colored pencils, or poscas, or a good sketchbook, but I watched you do those things in your videos, and looked up to the art you do, and my art was made a hundred times better by it.  I never would've found my passion for art if it wasn't for your book, and your videos. You've changed my life. And Even if I don't watch your videos as much anymore I will never stop being thankful for you. So I just had to say thank you ❤
hihihi❤

I know I am a little late because I only just got notified but I love Moriah videos and she has been an inspiration to me  You have made me become in love with rainbows and I go to school so whenever we can do bubble maps or creative work I am most likely to do rainbow 🌈.
