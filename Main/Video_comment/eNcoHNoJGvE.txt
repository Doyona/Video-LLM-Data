Great Man and funny
Absolutely right YALL  KATT WILLIAMS IS HILARIOUS AND HE'S AWARE THAT THEYWILL STEAL  DIFFERENT COMEDIAN MATERIAL  KMSL LMAO SMDH MR POTATO HEAD AND  THE WALRIES
Thought this interview was priceless look at part 2
Love this ❤
He's only there cause he loves her❤
They're on my bucket list to meet❤😂🎉
❤
Sherry is pretty 😍
Chemistry
"You're a Siren" I'm kinda feeling that was biblical 😂😂😂
You know why now , we are on TV . You never looked at my eye for once . This looked like some private moment happened between them in the past that only both of them knew about . You still respect each other . 😊
The energy between the two is electric!❤❤
Wait a min he’s for sure in love with the host 😂❤
I dont care for Sherri but Love Katt!!@❤
The spiritual reunion was real in this interview. They would be an amazing couple. 🙏
Sherri was laughing her azz out. Lmao
I think Katt's favorite color is green💚
You've gotta be quick to catch what Katt be putting down! He gave so many clues with his eyes and face gestures and then topped it off by calling Sherri a Siren... if you know anything about Greek Mythology then you know! Perhaps he's now ready for a more mature woman that can really be a team player with him! 🙏🙏❤❤
Who's here to see the dress after the new video ? 😁
WE LOVE KATT🎉🎉🎉🎉. WITH HIS HANDSOME SELF🎉🎉🎉
Katt Williams is an amazing person. I met him before they tried to tear him down. He is a real kind, gentleman. No, I didn't sleep with him.
Im gonna put it out there. For me, outside of the late great Bernie. Katt owns the King of Comedy Crown for me. He has me crying every single time, and he's decent people.
Kat must love her. Showed up with flowers.
He such a prophet
Yes, yes, yes, on that universe banking system
Whew what did i just watch lol 🫣🤫
TWO LEGENDS 🎤🎤  Talking and That's What it is.
Yes Sir! You give and it always comes back. I live by this❤❤❤❤
He is from Dayton like me. I've always loved this man! ❤❤❤❤
Their energy was dope
🤩Mr. Williams and I have never crossed paths before, but before I leave this rock l’d 🫶🏽 to meet him.
Y’all are so cute.
My guy ❤ 0:17
I just love your show Miss Sherri Shepherd thank you so much for having Katt Williams on your show I get to see him I track him down on Facebook and all all different kinds of platforms yes it's always good to see him it's always good to see him he's very funny as you know but it just it's just so good to see him😊
Katt is a bigger man than most men at 6ft5

RaTT Williams.  Enough Said .... Next >>
Alriggght 🤣😂🤣 9:22
I come here every once in a while for the smiles
3/22/2025 God given talent love Katrina 🌻
I love Katt Williams and  you Sherri. ❤❤❤
Theyre not flirting im a Taurus ♉ it seems thy way when we have a bond with someone its very close and connection is a standout but its not always flirting we will definitely say uk im flirting right??? Lol we are blunt they're simply having a normal interview she is a siren 🚨 that's good u kant unsee us
Do you know a real man when you see them because they won't take ownership of all the good stuff that people tell him he does he's such a humble man and does not want any recognition of all the good things he does he's helped hundreds of people get off the street he's also helped a lot of friends and just a lot of people in general he also gives a lot to charities an absolute beautiful and humble human beingKatt Williams Charity Work Some of the charities supported by Katt Williams are Caring For Our Children Foundation, G-Unity Foundation and The Royal Liverpool Charity.
I can't stand Kim Kardashian she's only famous for being famous where at least Katt Williams is famous because of what he does for a living Katt Williams is a real one he doesn't hold back he tells it like it is and they're the sort of people that I can connect with
I love the chemistry they have lol. They would make a cute couple.
Katt needs the Baptism Ruach Hoqodesh  who is the power of Yah Shalom
she looks so pretty when she smiles
Love KATT WILLIAMS❤
The way he hugged her he still has some feelings for her. awe its so cute.
Omg he totally likes her !!! He can’t look at her !!! He seems to me he’s scared getting his heartbroken by her !
🙏🙏💪✌️❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹😘
I love katt!❤
I love this man ❤❤❤❤❤
IKR.. His 1st Dates/Meet ups be so Awkward, crossbows and traffic will have you  missing each other.
You can tell a genuine person when they give from the heart not only when camers are flashing. This man oozes goodness.
I ❤️ Sherri And I ❤️ Katt I Think They Are Awesome  Talent People
I love you Katt Williams your a great man and a great comedian God Bless you ❤❤
Oh my, Kat was so vulnerable in this interview. My goodness. He is smitten by Sherri.
3:10 when she said no i got mad af praying on sb downfall like tht😂😂
Brother man couldn't keep still. Sherri over sitting high and lifted up. Katt just a rockin'.
I love when Sherri laughs
These two need to play a married couple in someone's movie.😅
He look good with the locs!!
Why he didn't look at her eyes?😮
Was I under a dam rock??? I love them together!!!! Katt you better stop playing!!!
Katt had Sherri smiling from ear to ear the entire interview.
Katt has such a grown man mindset, whew😮‍💨
The jacket 🔥
I pray almost daily for Katt Williams to get the love and respect he deserves
The tension between these two, who would have known.🤭 Why this feels similar to Jimmy Fallon and Nicole Kidman their failed date!!!😂😂😂
She is a siren i know that thing good and screams well
Katt is fine af❤❤❤
Katt Williams a wolf dressed in sheep clothing Freemason puppet
Katt Williams always keeps it P
He hasn’t looked in her eyes because that cleavage 🤣 that’s why she laughed
I Swear. Lol. Guys ALWAYS have to kill the moment. I love katt too. But. C'mon katt. Why u being like that. Lol. Cuz he was put on blast.  Sherry was being super in the moment and genuine, with some flirt, and truthful .. straight from the heart and said she loved him. And katt said it back. Along with calling her a siren ... 🤦🏻‍♀️. Ugh. Katt. C'mon. Lol
nothing but love in this clip
Katt Williams helping out a struggling Ms Pat during one of the hardest part of her life will always make me a fan of his.
I love how uncomfortable he is when she is talking about his charitable works. This says alot without saying anything.
When you give somebody they flowers as a guest on a show says a lot
Such a gentleman
Love u Katt Williams thanks for the laughs 😊
I like Katt, but I don't believe what whole thing about him and Prince, and the thing at the concert. That sounded a lot like some of stuff he claimed on Club Shay Shay
Wonderful video, A month ago, I ended a five-year relationship. I'm irritated because I can't see my life with anyone else. The love of my life chose to leave me, and I loved him so much that I can't stop thinking about him. I've done everything I can to get him back. Though I've tried my hardest to stop thinking about him, I can't help it. I'm not sure why I'm writing this, but I miss him a lot and can't stop thinking about him.
I am 76 years old and I still love cat Williams
Sherri is looking good!! 🔥 😮
She wore that on purpose yesss girl 😍🤣
I love a little big man.🌸
To the limo driver. We need more people like you and katt William.. God bless both of you cause that was an amazing and wonderful thing that you both did for those people..
Lier Prince didht fk with him .. he was always to himself
LOVE YOU KATT.
He's shy. It's very sweet.
Sherri’s boob reduction is the best thing she's ever done, she looks so much better.
This is how you treat a star! Bravo!
She is just so gorgeous. Her smiling had me hypnotized 😮😆
Sherry got her chest out and all😂
PLEASE COME TO SOUTH A\FRICA.......
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
A deep brother who has continually shown the spiritual blessings of compassion to struggling people. Thank, you, Sir!
Love you ❤Katt!
I think Katt Williams and Sherri Shepherd have special feelings towards one another and may have at one time really been emotionally attached that does not mean that they were intimate or dated but if you ever had a real friend that you really care about so deeply and you always have the best interest at heart.
I just love Kat Williams. What a genuine human. Kat Williams is a GOOD man. I love the Sherri Show and adore Sherri. She makes my mornings EVERYDAY! Love you Sherri!!!!
I like when Katt snitched out Diddy and those freaks LOL 😂
Katt Williams is just.that.dude. Point blank, period!
Anybody ask who’s the most realest comedians of all time? The answer will always be Katt Williams and Bernie Mac. Katt is definitely a dope comedian that belongs on the Mount Rushmore of stand up comedy
Yes he is He gave my brother money on the streets of Los Angeles and gave him encouragement (my brother is no longer with us) But I am sure that I will encounter Katt one day to get the opportunity to say Thank you for your kindness you shown my brother You are an Absolutely Amazing Man
Kat Williams is the greatest comedian of all time...he is the GOAT of comedy...I love him and I wish the best for him...He is so humble and there will never be another one like him...Prays for you always....
It seems like every time he is being interviewed he is very shy but on stage he is a beast telling so many stories and jokes and keeping  the crowd laughing non stop. And on a side note I have a you tube channel type in Russell Mills May 22, 2017 to find me.
I love Cat Williams he just tells the truth ❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
I just ❤him he is true & honest. I am so glad he uses his voice for the good of all. He is funny but he is a great human…..🙏❤️✌️
Katt is blessed for having faith
Woha wo ha ha happen 😂
I love Katt for his comedy and his honesty,  He's the real deal.
2 of my favorite entertainers on the same show! I’m in heaven! ♥️♥️♥️
Love you Katt ❤❤❤❤
He is so humble just like Prince
" i thought you were meeting me there..." that was smooth and respectful.😂😂
Love Katt Williams❤ he is an Incredible human being❤ Pure soul KW❤
Katt is the best.  I have heard Katt does give money away to help people who need a leg up and need some money. Just like little, Bossie needed some money when he got out of the big house. (I may have missed spelled the rappers name)😮😮
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
New fan of Katts. Dude is a good guy
Katt got Kanye'd by Kim K at a Prince concert. 😄
Lol...I waited
About time he finally gets Dreadlocks  Finally  Much Love Brother Katt Williams
He look better with dreads!!
Boosie said when he was locked up Katt Williams out of no where sent him some money and he always love Katt for that
Love Sherri and so Happy Katt Williams is above number 1 in this moment
That was soo sweet and nice  to bring her followers.
I love this look on Katt. It fits his personality so well.  He is REALLY such an amazing human being. ❤
Okay Katt I love you but...sounds like you're talking a lot of bullshit on here.
Beautiful
He seems so shy to me
Katt needs some caribic flavour!
I have noticed that super focused men lower their gaze when the temptation is infront of them because they are married to their legendary legacy they ll leave for the world. I have seen a pattern in legendary footballers.... they ll lower their gaze n keep hands to themselves n be awkward.   They just scan the world differently. I wish Sherri the best, she is a beautiful woman. ❤❤
❤️KATT💯💪🏼🤟🏼🤙🏼
I WOULDN'T MIND HAVING A DATE WITH KATT WILLIAMS,HE'S SMART, DARK, FUNNY,  AND HANDSOME JUST A  DATE, NO SEX, I'M A OLD SCHOOL QUEEN, VERY SLOW, EVEN WHEN I FIRST START DATING, IF I DON'T KNOW HIM,  I ONLY WANT TO GET KNOW HIM FOURTHLY, BEFORE I HE CAN ENTER THIS QUEEN.......         LIFE, CONTINUE HAVING A BLESSED LIFE.
He soooooo wise gosh!!!
SHERRI...GIVE HIM A CHANCE!!!@
they have had RELATIONS
Katt Williams Paid 40;000  for Melba Moore a Star on Hollywood ................................. thats how you Honor black legends of R and B
I applaud him for taking up for my cousin Bernie Mack..i kno Bernie was smiling.❤
I think he is so handsome especially when he smiles. 😊
Lawd he just getting sexier and sexier or is it my hair and glasses fetish 😂
Katt looks good with his hair like that.
Please tell him to come to Lubbock
I hope they get married.  I love them together. 💗 ❤🎉
`mon Katt you stood her up????
❤ need some help from you I'm in Houston Texas
❤ amen 🙏 good bless you and have a great time
@Themadnesscollective
Mr Katt Williams is my favourite comedian, i have always admired his witt, tenacity, strength and heart towards every human being... My husband and i love him to bits💗🫶 we love you katt, you have our heart as a couple🥹🥹🥹
I didn't watch her in the eyes too...😂
They don’t make them like Katt no more. I’m loving this dude more & more by the day - 1st off he is a comedic genius, he is a courageous man and tops it all with being a kind soul!!! What a man.
KATT is not the traditional comedian or person he is what I strive to be not like any other STARS
That's A Real Dude!
Lol... Looooove Katt Williams 😂😂😂
I think they used to go out together!
He's very careful how he speaks. He's modest, and he doesn't like talking about his being humble. Sherri is still riding what makes him humble. She's not reading her room (Katt)
A beautiful interview ❤️ Phyllis Montana-Leblanc. New Orleans, Louisiana. YouTube ☝🏿 Love him. ❤️
Ok... are they just friends? Somebody spill the tea.
He sponsored Melba's hollywood star? Wow, those cost 50k
Hes such a fine man with a fine spirit
I love 😍 me some Katt Williams
Katt is the goat
Katt is a very smart man.
👍🏾
That was super cute! I love the chemistry!
What a person! Kat Williams
He said you are a siren 😮 lol omg she know what that mean
Love you back, you are a inspiration ❤ Katt Williams..
Come to  Jamaica 😂❤
Love you so much ❤❤❤
People always say this dude is generous
Katt is a adended master he has already conquered this plane.  He lives outside of carnality, God protection is upon him cause he is about his fathers business and he flipoed the world upsidedown  natural man dewelling in sirtually highness we all  respect you even those you spoke of you still loosed chains of bondage from the souls let righteousness  continue to prevail🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉speak 🗣️ God
The generosity comes from his heart .
HEY  KING  KATT!!!
La langue Commune et s'assembler en communaute restreinte avant de penser aux Etats-Unis d'Afrique... c'est la solution que je retiens... Merci a vous "Funerailles des tabous". Great discussion as usual!
Thanks Katt blessings thanks 🙏🏿❤️👍👏
God doesn't make mistakes. Katt is a living example. Stand firm and the blessings will pour from Heaven's above. I salute you Katt... Winning!
Genius Cat!!!
Harley Davidson do us a favor, step up your game! I like the idea of the air bag jacket and pants but, wonder how bulky and high maintenance they are. Think they may be good for long highway rides. Stay Hoggin y'all!
That’s why we adored him
Loves, loves some Sherri
Why y'all Igsnorning each other😅🎉
Look at how respectful and lovely this interview was. And it was still funny. What was that other lady that came attacking Katt trying to accomplish?! Smh💀
She looks gorgeous
I've never heard of you Sherri but I do mow thanks to Katt Williams.
Katt is fine
Sherri looks good, and as a heterosexual woman, I must admit: Katt is fresh to death and I wouldn't mind cuddling up with that man regardless of our age gap 😂 We like the same height and same comedic aura and everything, the shit would match perfect. Make a Bitch Foundation, hook it up okurr 👈🏾🥹🥹
I was Katts personal nail tech and paid handsomely, given a week off for woman stuff, and aw how awesome this would actually be if it were true! I'm just trying to fit in with the rest of theses comments! All these people knew this necka personally now! 😂😅
Men! 🤣🤣🤣
Sherri ran prince off the stage when she was on the view. She is a loving aggressive type. She got personal asking him about not looking in her eyes. She ask for that response. And he told her she is ungreatful. Listen she want him to do the same for her. When a man dont care for you in that way they will let. You know. He is hugging that coach staying far away from her.
I like the way he think before he speaks 😊
Love Virgos ❤
Hallelujah Katt Williams😊
Did anybody else look up siren?😅
I have become 1 of his fans and I have so much respect for him thank you and may God continue to Bless you and your
Katt Williams is the real deal. He is all about doing good, love, truth, work and some work. He puts in the time to craft his brand and his end result will always be an excellent product. ❤

Katt gave the Spiritual formula of deposits and withdrawals in giving to kingdom works ❤🙌🏽✨️
Katt Williams is truly an amazing man and father.  I've always been a huge fan n will forever ❤
Here only because I saw the club Shay Shay podcast. We take life for granted in so many ways. This guy is an amazing human being. I have never been to his show but have always watched his standup specials. I have mad respect for Katt and I don’t have to be in his presence to know he is genuinely a good dude!
Katt looking real good right here 🥵
He has the best smile. ❤
my dawg for sure🎉
They should date for real ! And i wanna see that golf date. They should record it.
I love their chemistry  I love his vocabulary and how he's a gentleman with her and how he answered the questions in this interview. I always have love Katt and continue to. 🎉🎉🎉🎉 Sherri I love u and u show.
I love Kat ❤❤❤❤
A “new you” = cloning. Selling your soul. Don’t be fooled by Katt. He’s one of them.
He sounds a lot like Prince
Katt Williams should run for president
I love everything about Kat but the way he thinks before he speaks is something we can all take from him! God Bless you Kat you are the light through all the darkness in hollywood and with God in his heart theres no darkness than can ever touch his beautuful soul!
I believe Katt William is a decent person. I believe his heart is big and he will help us if he could. I wish I could meet Katt and have a conversation with him. I believe he would give me the advice I need to know. I’m raising my grandson and my son was murdered. I have to get out of Ohio. Ohio is a trap for our people…❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂"I thought I was suppose to meet you there" I ❤Love you Katt Williams ", you make me laugh!
I love him and his respect for God and his faith.  He always talks about how blessed he is and rich (not by $ standards).  And to learn that he's did all of this giving w/o recognition is even better.  May God continue to bless you!
Katt Willaims is an amazing human being!! Also love Sherri…that woman is funny!!!!
This is so cute 🥰.. I need to know what's up.  Lol
That dude is a trip man, and the real deal.
I will say... Katt cleaned up nice for Ms. Sherry lol
Katt always dropping 💎 Always listen to him carefully
Its crazy how thirsty we are for genuine people in such a fake world. We were starving for it... Need more Katt
Yall need to go on and get a room....oh my
He has a humbleness that is magnetic.  ❤
Sherri Shepard is so LOUD !    Oh my goodness 😮
I’d like to see these two together ❤❤❤❤
...Yes I Came Over To "Sherri" Page To See This Wonderful Set Down With Kitt Williams...And See All The Comments🥰
I’m screaming like he brought the flowers for me 😂
Katt is THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ON TV! Hands DOWN! A heart of gold
Katt will always be blessed. To much is given much is received.
Katt has been my favorite comedian since the first time I saw one of his stand up. Love Katt Williams
This has got me so emotional more reason to love Katt besideshe is the 🐐
💎🤴💎
Sherry looks amazing
This man is amazing he’s a true man of the most high🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💕👏🏽
I think Katt gonna give her da kack !!!
I’m on a Katt binge too. Him and Sherri have chemistry 😅❤
Okay I need some backstory on Katt & Sherri because something is definitely there between them 🤍🤍🤍
They make a great couple!
When you give do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. So that your giving may be in secret. And, your Father who sees in secret will reward you. 🙏🏽😉👌🏽🎯💯
"Please welcome my friend, Half Williams!"
I've never watched her show but I honestly love this woman and her energy.
Yes❤
Bravo to Katt, GOAT!!!🎉🎉
this guy is so positive
Some chemistry there for sure
❤❤❤love me some Katt Williams and Sherri❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Loving the banking analogy to explain kindness.❤❤❤ I will borrow for future use... May not necessarily cite the source.😊
She kind of built like Wendy 😂
Katt says things without saying things  "YOUR RIGHTFUL HOME" meaning daytime television not standup comedy  This man has a way with words 😂😂😂
💪🏼🙏🏼💜blessings to everyone, if you haven't yet repented and accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord and Savior, please do so before it's too late, it's not God's will for none to perish. Acts 2 vs 38, John 3 vs 16 Romans 10 vs 13
Love his bank of the universe metaphor ❤❤❤
I've always loved Sherri she's always been a class act she also beautiful and funny im glad she has her own show
Prince really is an influence on him. His swag mystique intelligence and spirituality. Whoever he chooses to be his wife is a  lucky lady ❤
1 Word - Real!❤ 🌺
My best/childhood friend is like Katt, so unrelentingly generous, kind, selfless and i constantly have to worry about if certain people are taking advantage of her but she is so smart and intelligent and i know she notices it and she will be like certain people will be like that and she has to be who she is. I love her and i am forever in her corner
Katt got me smitten ☺️
I love Katt!
I miss Wendy. I hope she’s ok.
Love Kat
How can someone be negative towards someone who actually help people WITHOUT expecting ANYTHING in return💯
Her energy actually seems offputting to me, from the start of their date. In an old interview, she said she purchased a set of clubs. Why not just rent from rhe place or use his? Then to admit to sitting and excessively waiting crazy
He looks amazing here ❤
Katt lookin good with them dreads okay!!
What an absolute gentleman, I haven’t seen any man bring flowers to a hostess in years!!! How lovely!
Everyone want Katt on their show now...lol
Real guy... he do it and doesn't broadcast it
I love Kat Williams personality...he is real.
Sherri you ungreatful muskrat you just got flowers. Im glad kat called you ungreatful.
Katt would have been funny on 30 Rock
Omg! Have Tina Fey On!!!
Whatever he looks at and wants he gets!
I can see Prince being his inspiration !
Kat ghosted you🤣🤣! And now is sorry 🥰🥰🤣🥰!
Genuine men hard to find. Hes the real deal
When a man makes you laugh. You definitely gonna blush and get all girly.
Katt is amazing! ❤
I’ve been a make up and hairstylist for 22 years. I had the opportunity to work for Katt 3xs in my Career. Katt was always a respectful, kind and always were very into the people who worked for him. In 2005 my brother who was close to me passed away. During the mourning of my brother someone left an envelope outside my door with money 💰. It was Katt that left the envelope and a card that said sorry for your loss. I’ve always knew that this man was put there by God and hope God continues to bless him so he can be an instrument in Gods hands.
I always liked Kat. Not only is he funny he’s humble Ive always heard that he was a giving person and he adopted 7 kids. They tried to downplay him and say negative things about him he has his flaws but his good out ways his bad.
Katt Williams is absolutely adorable❤❤❤❤
Great interview!!! ❤
(A. Figueroa)  I wonder if Prince and Katt could be related.  Their facial structure is almost alike.  Katt is just a little darker than Prince.  I love Katt's hair like this.
A beautiful interview full of beautiful compliments and love. Such a good look!! Love Katt Williams!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
confidence
I’m genuinely curious as to why Katt isn’t married.. He’s so sweet! 🥰
To whom much is given, much is required and Katt really understand that.
😂I volunteer to be their CADDY on that golf date💯
😂 When Prince said, "KATT" of course Kim thought he was talking to her🤣🤣🤣
😂 So happy "KATT'S" have 9 Lives👏🏽
I felt that 🔥
Katt n Sherri ❤  Am I seeing a shy Katt Williams 😮😊😂😂😂❤
I wish there was a movie about Prince’s life and I truly believe Katt is the best pick for the main role.
This was a delight to watch
Kat you are: That Kat, never will be another!  You are a legacy born as,  will live as,   certainly will never die. You have reached the pinnacle of your purpose.   I know you are satisfied with whom you bring to this life.   Your spirit and fullness. I can't help myself when I hear and see you, you are one with the I am.  Thank you for ever to live in your truth. You are the aspiring one. You will never die your spirit will be left as a legacy . You rank with the eternal. With God all things are possible.  I don't want you ever to transcend.  You give off the energy of hope, confidence and truth  to us all and back to the universe.  I don't know how to thank you. You are the truest form of being. Love you so deeply. I may never see you on this earthly platform I'm sure to see you in heaven. DeVera.  The Truth
KATT IS THE REAL 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐 AFTER HEARING HIS STORY
He already told us he loves women energy 😅 but Sherri really blushing ☺️ and he refuse to eye contact 😂 saying “we on tv Sherri” 😵‍💫🤣 Yes he deserve his 💐
What a beautiful soul inside and out. I remember he threw a bag with $15,000 racks to Boosie when he was going through it and never bragged about it. He’s helped so many people and kept it to himself! ❤️
Who's here after the Club Shay interview? Katt has understood the assignment
Cat is my new discovery…. My first time paying attention to him was on sha sha and I realized how smart he was.  I will definitely support him
I. LOVE that Katt's locing his hair!! 💜🔥💜
I am happy to know you are a Virgo  your personality and truthfulness and directness speak volumes about who you are, not everyone going to love but that's OK the ones that does are kind of lifetime friends
I’ve loved Katt since his beginning back in the day!
Kat is a very intelligent Person with many Anointed Talents from GOD❤
ok. so today, January 13, 2024 THIS shows up on my algorithm.... and here i DROPPED EVERYTHING to see this "ShayShay" followup.... but, alas....this was way prior 🤣🤣
I have never looked at Katt Williams as a sexy man.  But oh my goodness...  he looks so sexy in this interview.....  My new celebrity crush!!!!!
Sheri darling, i think the twins were trying to get a look in. It's no wonder the poor man couldn't look you in the eyes.

That was cute
I love Katt Williams. I can listen to him talk all day🥰❤️😍
The dreads look good on him👏🏾💯😍
My sis and her daughter was driving in SB and 2 black men pull over at 3al..it was Katt Williams they helped my sis move her car off the fwy and when my sis when back to her car Katt left $300 on her seat...I/we have been trying to reach him to say thank you...and invite him and the kids to our annual fam/friends picnic
I love this interview!! Katt is looking GOOD and he's such a humble, real and down to earth person who doesn't hesitate to tell the truth!! I LOVE YOU KATT!! Sherri looks great!!🌹❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾
Matthew 6:1 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
Sherri is looking gorgeous ❤

I just love Katt Williams 🙏🏽❤️ FR
Katt is ONE OF THE BEST human beings EVER!!  Authentic
When the world turned on kat.  I never did.  He’s been my number 1 from the start.  And I’m so damn happy to see the rest of the world finally catching on.  And seeing he isn’t some crazy person.   He’s to smart talented and humble to ever be like most of these weirdo Hollywood people.
What happened to everyone who used to talk smack about him? It's like they all love him now but he's been a cool person. The media tried painting a bad picture of him in the past. Maybe some ppl were tryna blackball him smh.
They should get together ❤
Good answer Kat 😂😂
Katt looks great with those locs i love it
Yes he gave my cousin money just because she let him use the restroom at the hotel she was working the front desk at.
Ungrateful. Hahahha. Right on Katt!
7:30 wow so true "deposit good things into the universe so that your withdrawals are never denied" ✨️Katt Williams
Katt knows that God gave him everything and he must show appreciation by helping God’s people who don’t have as much. Because that’s Islam in its purest form.
5:10 - "you don't practice your material on stage, you do it at home" -- Huh???? Wait .. isn't that what you're supposed to do?? Well, no wonder you failed, Sherry. You trying to work out all your mistakes on stage 😂
I love what he said about the universe being a banking system. And you have to make sure you deposit so that when you need a withdrawal,  it's not denied.  I feel like he has so much to say and should have been given a voice  more often.
This man is a good example of kindness. He never admitted to be generous.   He said, “he understands how the universe works and the formula of kindness. Continue to put deposits in and it shall return.”WOW
just curious but does anyone know if katt been on a white podcast. im a big fan and im starting to see a trend. lol
There was more than just "Chemistry" here...there was fire. An intelligent man doesn't label a woman "siren" without cause.🤔
I will always love Katt Williams he is a realist 💯...
😂❤everyone knows Katt Williams now😂😂😂 let his tall do something America doesn't like..the phony side will show their face😅
Love me some Katt❤ And loved Prince😂 I always knew there was an affiliation and that's probably why I took to him so well (I was a die hard wore purple because of Prince-Fan)🤩🎉🎉🎉 Imagine ppl trying to tear you down and your true character shines through it all because of the many ppl you helped 🤧...Poetic. JUSTICE)  Katt's a Brave MAN❤.
The *Necklace* is disturbing☹
Sherry love you girl, sorry I have not been watching for while, been busy. I just had to see this Katt interview ❤❤❤.  Keep pushing and make this shit legendary 👏🏾 🙌🏾
I love how he loves you❤😅. Girrrrl.....!
I don't own a TV, who is this lady.
That man sowed seeds and through all his challenges the harvest of those he blessed is able to lookout for him and give him a platform when the bigger folks have shunned away from him. That the deposit he was speaking of.
Whos here after club Shay Shay???
Katt is truly something. He loves turning women down 😂 just to prove a point 😂 aaah I love it
Didn't know they had history
"The universe has a banking system that it is imperative you  put deposit in on a regular basis so that your withdrawal is never denied,almost being to big to fail in earthly terms...."🫰🏾
I love how he pauses and think before he speaks. I admire that. I need to learn more patience.
Katt and Sherri make it happen!!!❤
Me❤
Amen Prayers privately and it works🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️
She was last resort - the main course came thru that’s y
He looks really good here❤
Shay Shay was such a muffin
I feel like she’s trying too hard!🙄
Always loved Katt! One of the finest 👌🏽!
Katt looks wonderful
Katt is the real deal, Sherrie, babyeeee!!! He just might be da one!!!!!! Don’t sleep on short guys now, he’s still feelin’ you 😉
On Shay Shay club  he said he's careful at what he sets his eyes on. This solidified that statement hard body for me. OooooooooO @katwilliams Thank you for always being solid.
All he wants us his flowers and ge dont like being pushed aside by suppose to be Brothers
@9:22 He don't be looking in ppls eyes... what he knows about Sherri might not be a good thing 👀 SPILL THE TEA KATT!
Im just now realizing he has dreads. I like this hairstyle on this handsome fella.
He’s a man of prayer and peeps don’t know you don’t need to flash the God card.
The Man is a Genius, He said He taught He was stood up for as Many Holes.
0:19 I LOVE how he didnt graze her body with his hand. There was air and space
“You’re a siren” she laughs, goes over her head. Katt is super deep
I’m so glad Katt is finally getting his flowers while still giving them . I’ve met him a couple times he’s a dynamic dude. 💕💕💕💕💕🥹
I didn't realize he had legends on his tour. Mark Curry, red Grant and Tommy Davidson are legends in the game. Some of the funniest people on the planet.
God bless katt your the best
Lol
I love katy
I just love me some Katt he keeps it so real and people just don't want to but he drops it 💯
❤👑❤️👑 GREATNESS ACKNOWLEDGES GREATNESS 🥂
He does give off prince vibes tho…kinda talks like him too. Also dresses like him n kinda looks like him
This was a a great interview.  Katt is cute, like his friend and mentor Prince. ☺😍💜
He looks very handsome. Loving the hair and wardrobe.
7:18 - 7:44 wisdom
I HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR KATT WILLIAMS.He's not only a STANDUP FATHER TO 10 CHILDREN,HE'S NEVER BACKED DOWN FROM ANYTHING HE BELIEVES IN,ASA WELL AS A TALENTED MAN THAT USED HIS TALENTS TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL AND NOT THE WELL BEING AND LIVES OF THOSE CLOSE TO HIM BY SACRIFICE.I'm not a great fan of sherri shephard because she's willling to KISS ASS but in her defense I have never heard of anything harmful done by her to come up.
Sherrie had the ta-tas out just for Katt! ❤
That’s all we needed to know when he said you’re a siren
Passed out drunk
You stay true to yourself.Sherri is so right about you.
Katt is a Blessing to so many comics who didn't want to sell their soul for a bag! 💰
i stan this man.
Did he take her miniature golfing?
Katt looks so much better the older he gets.😂❤
Why is this 480p max resolution ?
Sherri is freaking gorgeous yikes 😍
I THINK HE'S A BEAUTIFUL INDIVIDUAL INSIDE AND OUT AND I HOPE GOD KEEPS HIM SAFE FROM ALL THE UGLY THAT'S INSIDE HOLLYWOOD❤❤❤
Katt is God's apple of his eye
Did anybody else catch him call her a siren! Lol 😂 he’s trying to avoid being pulled in by her charm ❤❤ love you guys and love this interview!!
I was NOT a fan of Katt for years.  But, when that interview was done with Shannon, I became a 100% fan.  God bless this man kw❤
Reason have confident had leo in chart also have intelligent man

Katt Williams!!!!!!!!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿🎉🎉👍👍👍🌹🌹🌹🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
I love all the sweet stories of Katt and he’s alive 💐 💐
STOP, KAT! You KNOW you ain't right Sherri need to fire her wardrobe person letting her walk out there like she's a stripper.
This just brought a smile to my face.  ..they should do a rom com together
Awwah, Sherri and Katt would make a cute couple. I could see the love sparks flying everywhere LOL!
Katt bold asf with them 3 different greens on lol
The Kingdom has a formula...selah...
The chemistry was top tier 😂
WOW Kat has vocabulary
All right silver fox🦊😂😂😂😂
He looked good in this interview... Father of 10! That's wild!
Katt Williams take a Bow. He is in a Class of his Own. Thank you Sir❤❤❤
Need Higher Resolution vidoes here, Come on Step it up! Your Youtube videos should atleast be 1080p...
They would make a great couple
Katt looks so good always Loved him ❤️
It’s sweet he brought flowers
Kat needs his own show!
Katt earned the title icon. Amazing.
He likes her. Sherry this is your guy!
It’s a shame that you have to do something different every time to prevent  stealing
Why is Katt so insecure
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Kat making a renaissance for sure!!
Katt is the King
Sherri is looking right! She so pretty
He called her a siren. That was deep. Probably went over a lot of people’s head
That my guy buy that hair is hideous.....get that crap out ur head Katt
You have to respect Katt if nothing else, he doesn’t help people for clout or for the cameras he just does it because it’s the right thing to do. He has a good heart and the universe will continue to grant him success in many other ways. Katt gives you respect if you show him the same positive energy but if you come at him sideways with shade or malicious intent he’ll give you the same right back
The formula is REAL…it’s 💯 about the intention. Too big to fail in earthly terms…the man is a walking, breathing book 📖 of quotes 😆
How do you not love this guy..
goat I give you my flowers, let us not forget Robin Harris. amen.
He gives every platform millions of views
It come from god Laws
He looks good as a dread.
I need a geo prizm that I can use to deliver groceries for Instacart Kat.
2 Timothy 3:5  Having a form of Godliness but denying the power thereof...  The Universe doesn't have anything to do with it..  God's law of Sewing and  Reaping is what it is!!!  Give and it shall be given unto you...  Luke 6: 35-38...  If people are gonna give God the credit then give him the credit... because he is due the Credit... the Honor and the Glory. NOT!!! the  Universe!!!!
Katt the absolute legend 🔥
He is so awesome.
😂😂😂
All that's nice he brought her flowers 🌺🌹
He sounds a little like Prince.
They would be a cute little short couple
What a set up for each interviewer to ask questions that pat Katt on the back. He isn't bragging but his agents just set it up so that others do it. Sherri is doing it, Shannon did it. LOL!
This is the Katt WIlliams, give me attention tour. LOL!
I love me some katt❤
Katt wasn’t going lie with her to make her look good like he really tried to talk to her she just making up stories
Who’s here watching nothing but Kat W interviews after Shay Interview ⬇️
Katt Williams is the man!! King of Comedy ❤
The Special is going to be Special 🎉 2024
Damn. Sherri! Where's the thirsty emoji 😊😊😅😅 Ain't mad at ya though 😅😅😅
You’re a Siren misss Sheri 😂❤❤❤
POV: you’re on a Katt Williams binge 😂 he really is a good guy!
I never knew I liked Katt that much until I saw that interview. ❤ Now I'm seeking out interviews. 😂  Cool people usually don't get enough press. And liars make sure they won't.
I have a new profound respect and form of admiration for Mr. Katt Williams. He has been in a hot interview last week which is what led me here and every single comment, video or repost I've come across in the last week is nothing but positive recounts and experiences people have had with him. From top celebs to your regular Joe at the grocery store. He seems to be genuine and a truly caring and helping person. I respect that and adore it.
"You know why though... We are on TV..." 😂😂😂 SMOOTH OPERATORRRR
Who ended up here because of the club shay shay interview?? What a guy katt is!
His recent interview on Club Shay Shay is the 💣! 👏  A class act and humanitarian ❤
he looks so handsome

KATT WILLIAMS! The Ansolute Best Comedian since the Late, Great RICHARD PRYOR! For Many Years, He has been TOTALLY UNDERRATED. It's Great Seeing you on Sherri's Show. Great Job, Sherri!❤
I knew his personality reminded me of someone!!!💜💜💜
Side note: i would love to see Katts interior design at his home, intrigued as i know he's an intellectual Sherri's set is v reminiscent of her, femme, peachy, pink fun fluffy warm soft cloud-like feel
God's Best friend 🫡
Stop the world trying to tell us this man isn't the truth
He must like her because h e can't looking fine asf
I love Katt Williams. My husband and I attended his show at the Winstar Casino in Oklahoma the day after Thanksgiving and his show was OUTSTANDING!!! ❤💯
I felt like she was lying, but it he was like yeah fine sure.. didn't even look her in the eyes not once
I here NEVER saw / heard Katt this calm & relaxed
Remember, he did say if he looks at it, he get it
I find him attractive
Sherrie looked good and looked like she smelt real good. Katt was blushing the entire time lol
@9:22 THIS PART ❤- They are soooo cute! I wish they we’re datin😊 Btw: This is the look that Katt should stick too. I never realized how handsome he is (his hair being straighten was always a distraction for me)..Im indeed so intrigued by him. Soo good looking
One of the best
Sherrie’s looking good in that dress 👀👀👀👀👌🏽
Wonderful man! Thanks Sherri!
You're a Siren 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'll have a kilo of whatever that audience is having ;)
Wow, love the prayer stuff.
Kats interview with unc got me watching the rest of his older stuff and lemme tell you. Mans 100 with everything he says, the way he carries himself is in an elite category
i love this man so deeply.. KATT, you are LEGEND
KAT WILLIAMS  I LOVE AND APPRECIATE YOU ✝️ ❤️  THANK YOU FOR STAYING TRUE TO WHO YOU ARE CREATED! LOVE AND HUGS  KIMBERLY TATE❤👸
He’s a good man he deserves the world 🌎! It’s your time Kat you beyond loyal ! God said it’s your time for him to blessed you 😊
no homo but this negus hair is phucken gorgeous 😮
She didn't seem genuine
OMG! Katt is a genius 😂😂!  His responses in this conversation is natural and comedic at the same time. ❤❤❤
Why do Black people make up Sayings? Give you your flowers! Where are the flowers?. Taraji said it too in an interview with Jeffery wright!. black people I love you! but please stop it!.
He’s a man who truly believes in God, prays in secret- doesn’t let the left hand know what the right hand is doing and when God blessed you-the blessing is to share with others. 🙏🏾🙏🏾
KATT IN THE HAT ❤😂
It's amazing how this man was not recognize and all of a sudden did an amazing interview and now everyone is his friend. It seem all these people are fake.
he looks good and healthy.... Go Katt!!
Yes! Still selling out 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉. For Katt Williams, I will come on Sherry to comment
These two are adorable 😻😻😻 Sponsoring the stars on the Walk of Fame is $40k last I checked.
He not gone show that lining😂
I'm a flt attendant. I'd loooove to be on a plane as a passenger, stuck in a holding pattern going around and around LGA or LHR with Katt seated beside me.  I'd hope that plane would run out of fuel before it landed and my time with such an intelligent, insightful conversationalist and flirty, cheeky, sexy man came to an end!
❤Katt...❤Mark Curry...❤Tommy Davidson
🎉🎉🎉
Love love love Katt Willams. He is definitely the number one (next 2 David Chappell) comedian in the US!!!! 😊
Glad Katt stood you up, heffer
Whoa! Creating life & ignoring it is CRAZZY, Sherri you are horrible & i see why Katt ignored your bait, gross Sherri tried a love match again with writer Lamar Sally, marrying him in 2011. They ended up splitting in May 2014. Here’s where it gets tricky. The former couple then welcomed a son, Lamar, via surrogacy in August 2014. Lamar Jr. was conceived using Sally’s sperm and a donor egg. The child has since been raised by Sally, and Sherri has never met him,
Katt is one of my lifelong heroes he’s truly an amazing human being also Katt does reverse tithing he keeps ten percent for him and gives the other ninety percent away
I thought it was entirely rude for her to sit there and talk about all the generosity that he's done. When a man like that who does things because he has led by Christ he does not need to put it out there the ones that put it out there are obviously not doing it for the right reasons and she shouldn't have spoke on that. You can see how uncomfortable he was when she did that it's like so disrespectful
❤❤❤🙌
I feel like Kat Williams has entered his Silver Fox era. Just hitting it smooth and suave with all his answers.
Three words  LOVE YOU KATT ❤
I didn’t shorty was so sexy
He mentioned Tommy Davidson, im sorry to say he is not funny, he does a good Sammy Davis jr thing. Thats about it.
Who else bing watching everything katt Williams after shay shay?
You can’t teach what Kat has.   It’s given by god.
Man makes me cry with his wisdom. ❤
I am seeing why KATt talks so much about how Fake Hollywood is but lets talk about how Fake these Audeinces are and very staged. They clap at everything!!!!
I love Katt Williams
Yall know why I’m here
Beard looks good
Fly
The fruits of his labor...❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lying
I am not liar
I apologize Tommy Davidson and Mark Davidson
My apologies Melba Moore
Happy birthday America apologize to all
May God continue to bless your life ❤
Katt is sexy to me… I’m sorry
Katttttttt
Love Katt❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love Katt’s Spirit.  ❤
I'm here LIKING all these great comments. 👍
Katt loves and is raising children that he didn't bring into this world. Sherri made a choice to create a child but wont raise or have anything to do with that child. They have 2 different kinds of hearts. So leave him alone, Miss Sherri
Katt Williams is amazing... Now this is a person i wish I could meet
Sherri need to let go of that golf date shit.
Deposits equal   undeniable  withdrawalls.
God Keep Blessing  him lord!
King Kitty Katt❤😊
Is it me or does Sherry look absolutely SMITTEN by Katt?😂😂😂
He looks great!
I have always loved Katt Williams!!
Your a siren?   Hmmm….use discernment for that one eh?
I understand from his interview with Shannon he doesn't look at women in the eye because he'll get them. He's trying hard not to fuk up a good friendship.
❤q
Katt and Sherry would be a power couple!❤
Katt Williams call Sherry a siren Study with a siren is don’t give me wrong I like Sherry
WE LOVE U O.G.....U KEEP IT REAL ALL DAY EVERYDAY N SPEAK ABOUT OUR DEAR ALMIGHTY GOD LOUD & PROUD🙏❣️💯🙌🏼🎤
Shoot your shot Sherri 😂👏🏽💯
7:44
I love this 😂😂😂
Sherri Sherri Sherri.. mmmm calm down
No shade but Kat Williams reminds me of A Pimp Named Slickback. I Love Kat William though 😊
You too are cute together!
Sherri and katt needs to do a comedy series on tv. They are funny together. Maybe as a married couple with kids .That would be funny as hell.
1 Corinthians 13 !  Praise God!
Who is here after Katt podcast with club Shay Shay break internet?
🙏 ❤ 🙏 💚
Kat Williams ❤ is an angel 😇 💕
😍🤩💓
Katt talks mess about unfunny comedians and goes on this show? Sherri Sheppard is the worse "comedian" around.
I saw someone’s comment below of how kind Kat is and it’s all true he does stuff behind the scenes and this is why I have nothing bad to say about him anybody that does good without needing recognition for it is a good person in my eyes
I have a totally different respect for Katt after really learning more about him! He is definitely a special human being! May God continue to bless him!
Protect Katt Williams at all costs
This man has so much wisdom 🙌🏾🥹 and funny as heck!
Buddy said he don’t look at women bc if he look at em he got em… I 1000% believe it 🤣🤣🤣
After watching the interview with Shannon .I want to see all of Katt Williams old shows and interviews!!
Katt looks so good!! He and Sherri are cute together ❤❤
I love that man 💗
So where is the bashing? He didn’t attack anyone on her show. Interesting
Who's here after Katt Williams Club Shay Shay interview with Shannon Sharpe???? 😭😭
He called her a swan among ducklings....beautiful.
“Kinda like prayers works. Prayer is something that is really private, but because of how private it is that's how you know it's actually working because that's the only conversation I had about it and now it's fixed.” 🧡 @5:17
More layers to Katt .. never knew how intelligent & diverse he really is his blessings will come in abundance because he is real❤
He did a good job making Sherri blush
Prince, Sherri and Katt. Their work ethics and spirituality, love, kindness..what they have in common? Formerly Jehovahs Witnesses! 🙏🏾 they might not be one of US anymore but yall took away something good! For that, I give thanks! Love you guys❤️❤️🙏🏾
Good interview, and these two just click as friends. It was seamless.
6:02 Sherri and Deon Cole agree that Katt is very generous
Great guy
Kat Williams is so knowledgeable!
💐It is so beautiful he brought her flowers, so gentleman manners. Just great.
Love seeing a man bringing a woman flowers...true gentlemen ❤ love Katt..heart of Gold
Love me some Katt 🖤🩷
aND JUST LIKE THAT WE ALL BINGING kATTS uNWATCHED VIDEOS LOL
Katt is awesome 😊
Katt and Prince have the same bloodline I swear...they are so alike in a lot of ways
She so funny 😂🎉
Katt must be protected at all cost. Man is too smooth.
DID YOU DO THE GOLF THING AGAIN YET ?
The King
Katt is looking good❤
💚💚💚
Great comeback to standing up Sherri ❤😂 Both of you are wonderful!
🔥🔥🔥🔥

Such a beautifully soul. Katt is that solid.💝
Sherri you look amazing ❤! Loved this clip!
THE GOAT!!!
I thalt he had  that prince flavor
❤🙏🏾💯
❤katt Williams he remains me of a version of Prince
Katt's Prince influence is clear 🕺 🎤
Katt is a very Klassy MAN ❤
I’m here bc of the interview. I’m so happy that he does have true friends ❤❤
Sherri’s voice is so annoying..
BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL
"It is hard to hate the truth" - Pun intended. GOAT!
"How do I know that prayer works? Because that's the only conversation I had about it, and it's fixed." Wow!
He is funny as hell.
💚
I love Katt. He's real as real can be. He's so humble. It took a long time to jump on the bandwagon with him. I ve always liked him but now I love him.
My respect for kat Williams after his last tell all interview 😂 📈
He is a class act bringing her flowers
We love Katt Williams 🎉
She's is thirsty for some Katt ! 🤣
How him look so tall yasso?
Since that interview, I’m watching all Katt’s previous interviews! Lol
This how that rqdio host should have conducted her self
Live long and let God Prosper you both! ❤❤
What a gentleman😊
Sherri knew what she was doing wearing that dress 🧐 ain’t nobody peep he called her a siren tho 👀 it’s deeper than what one might think 💭
That was incredible philosophy Katt received from Prince. 😊😊
Looking like a cracked out jack sparrow
It’s been well known on the streets Katt will open up his wallet for the streets. He don’t tell no one either.
I like Sherri but she needs to either get a better fitting corset or just not wear them
Hi is iconic. Love him.
Sowing and reaping is REAL!
The comment he made about the universe and deposits and withdrawals was on a level too deep for some people to understand. 💯
Putting deposits in the universal banking system 🤔
Katt kinda fine Prince taught him well
A pimp name slick back 😅😅😅😂😂
Katt being friends with and inspired by Prince makes SO MUCH sense when I think about how Katt carries himself.
I can see the Prince Influence in Katt.
I love it when Katt does is fainting spell😅
Katt & Paul Mooney are the best!
I thought you where going to meet me there
Cannot believe she has a show
I love Katt
I’ve heard nothing but good things about Katt Williams
All blessings to Katt. In my eyes he paid Sherri the greatest of tributes to her femininity with no hint of lewdness at all: He said she was a "siren," that is to say one of that "number of women ... whose singing lured unwary sailors on to rocks." In other words, she is irresistible! B1
Sherri looking so good!! Yes!! I love Katt, my favorite comedian!
Him bringing flowers is so cute 😍Katt is a smooth dude haha
Period  he is loved i WISH i could meet him and say how much he is loved and have lunch and just laugh with him
I love him he’s so genuine ❤❤❤
This woman is despicable, she threw away a child who she paid a surrogate to carry and birth and people actually still interact with her, smh..
Love katt
That was a weird interview. Not sure what really went down between them in the past. But that laugh at the end was like “Nigga, please!” But she has to maintain composure on tv.
Not you’re a siren 🤣 Katt trying to avoid all temptations 😭
She had him smitten❤😂
That Banking anology is 100% true.
Prince was so beautiful
He is a great communicator.  It's great he practiced his jokes in his house to keep  jokes from being compromised. He is super smart
First show I appreciated from Sheri
He’s so sweet! He made her feel so special just sitting there. ❤
Sherri Shepherd is so damnnnn sexxxxxxyyyyyyyyy!!!!!! 🥰😍😘
Two icons
If you love Katt, I love you.  That's all there is to it. 💜
7:34 that is so true
They definitely fuck before
LONG LIVE KATT!!! I love Katt so so much. Been cracking up from this man since 2007. Love Katt
I’m do grateful to God that KATT made a come back !!!!
Did Melba Moore pose for that picture or did Melba Moore POSE for that picture?!?!🔥🔥🔥
I admire him so much. I love his whole story, his life journey, his comedic journey, his SPIRITUAL journey, just a unique, genuine and incredible man
Not me watching all Katt interviews after Club Shay Shay 😅
That was such a classy move of him, to bring Sherri those beautiful flowers. He may not be for everyone, but not everyone can handle the truth, can they? I for one wish more were like him.
Omg 🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️
Protect this man at all cost!!!
I swearrr this man does his giving in silence frfr
Who's Here Because Of What Just Happened 🤔
I need a house too❤
Katt Williams is for the people.
katt wanted to make her feel valued after what she had went through
🙏🏽🤍🙏🏽
Love Katt Williams ❤
Kat is the truth 🙌
You think Sherri called Katt yesterday?   Hell to the yeah! 😂
I love Katt. He's so professional, amazing at his work, funny af, handsome, and from what I've heard very generous. Hope you come back to Sacramento and God Bless, Katt and Sherri!
I believe Redd Foxx was the same way helping people.  Good on you, Katt.
He said he never looks at things he don’t want 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Sherri he don’t want u
I absolutely adore Katt!!!!
Marry her dude!  She's a beautiful,  smart, high standard, and good person.  You both deserve to be happy!  Sherry!  He's a good man! Adopted all those kids so his son could be with his blood siblings!  Come on y'all!
Fuckin ICON is what KATT IS!!!
Thank you Sherri for uplifting Katt. I felt sooo proud of this conversation.
Bravo Katt Williams ❤
That was a great interview☺️….I’ve never seen Kat so humbled 👍🏾😎
Katt and Sherri would be a great couple. Virgo and Taurus ❤❤❤
I love Kat he is naturally funny and so loved  you can tell he is a genuine person very sweet. I’m so mad he will be coming to perform here and I’m moving soon 😢❤
I watched this interview again after the dynamic interview Katt had with Shannon Sharpe. And, I have to say — I just noticed the chemistry at the end of this interview with Katt and Sherri 👀 Either there was or is something there but it’s something 😂 and I’m not mad at it!! ❤️
Did he call her a Siren? ❤😂👀
So nobody else thinks he’s a total a** for standing her up? Real small energy.
He sat down first
Love katt ❤
Sherri has always been cute to me
All jokes aside they could really be a power couple. ❤❤
"The Universe has a banking system and it is imperative that you put in deposits on a regular basis so that your withdrawal is never denied."   Katt Williams
Sherri wearing that dress ain’t she
Who would be better to play Prince in a film than Katt?  Don’t worry, I’ll wait …
Is it me or is Katt Wms kinda fine?🧐🧐🧐
Love Katt Williams and I loved Prince
I actually seen this on tv
sherry was trying very hard for that date
Is it me.... or does Katt & Lakeith Stanfield favor??  OAN:  I always thought all comedians practiced their routines at home.  Is this not so?
Sherri’s hair is laid babe. She looks good
For a guy who loves the truth he's scared as hell to tell it when it's in regards to his actions.
Katt gay
Always been my favourite comedian! 🙌🏼
Katt Williams the 2pac of comdey
I wish i meet him in person
Katt is True about prayer is private my pastor spoke about that in service in bible study
Wow! It’s God tho! I’m in the same place spiritually as Kat. When you give to people who really need it by Gods’s grace you will have even more!!!  I have always been a Kat fan! But now it’s sealed!!! ❤
Love Katt and Sherrie❤❤❤❤
He looks amazing✅🙏💯❤️
He’s a real star took him forever but right now he’s the man !
Red ain't funny tho😕
Respect ✊🏻
Who's here after Shay Shay?
❤
I think they would make a good couple
I will take Sherri to play golf, as long as I get use my driver to play all of her holes in the course. I don’t care if it’s grassy, dry, wet, sand, I will hit a hole in one because I am that good playing golf.
Dharma and Karma...I agree with Katt the universe sees everything.
Ohhhhhh my word. I wish I was Sherri Sheperd.
The chemistry is fire!!!
I love that man ❤️ huge Katt fan !
katt reminds me of bizzy bone in many ways his voice projection, the mustache ,an demeanor its odd but if you close your eyes an listen go listen to a bizzy bone interview lol long live katt
He needs to never wear fake dreads/extensions ever again
Sherri though, damn
I am a 64 year old white woman and I think Katt Williams is absolutely the best comedian out there. He simply cracks me up.
I adore this man. He speaks the truth and is not afraid to do so. ❤
Kat is a sexy man 😅
Katt, Curry, and Tommy Davidson?!?! ❤🎉 come on now
once prince is said i realky liked this
Daytime show is terrible. How can people watch or attend these crap shows???
I loooove this man!!!
God I adore him.
My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE Comedian.  Born into a Religious Father( a Pastor) he HAD to take in some of thise sermons, so he Knows Right from Wrong. It rubbed off on him.🥰 Hope 2go see him one day  , but my Lord, tickets here in Ft.Worth area  Texas Starts @$200+.. 82 & still wants to see him💯. Yes, Lord!❤
I drove a great limo in Las Vegas. For 5yrs. Met many celebs. Everyone of them were a disgusting ride😮 As an old white woman, Katt is " THE CATS MEOW"😅
He’s looking so good now! Woooooow.
I love Katts interviews..scholar and a gentleman. 🎉
Katt is amazing. We don’t deserve him!
I love Katt. He’s so genuine and I can just tell he’s a good human being. The humor is just the cherry on top.
The Pirate
Like fine 🍷 wine
Can ya stop with the dreds .. it’s always the people who can’t grow hair back in the day yet got these beautiful locks 😂
Now Katt, That's not the universe.  That's God, the Creator of the univers,  giving you the ability,  skills, and heart to give.
So good to C U A REAL N@&?$$ 4REAL🌹
Katt is a gift from God to all of us who enjoy his talent, and all of us who he so graciously blesses our hungry bellies. Bless you Mr. KATT WILLIAMS. And a HAPPY NEW YEAR to you sir.❤❤❤❤
Too whom much is given, much is required, May He continue to bless Mr. Katt Williams. We all who have been blessed are charged with the same.
I just love Katt  Williams!   The best!!
Mr. Williams is lookin Fly..❤😍❤️‍🔥. And he's a great human being. Blessings and Prosperity 🙏
A living legend spittin that game and give the world his genius.
These two should date❤
My cousin who is a comedian is good friends with Katt W.  My aunt invited Katt W. over to eat Cuban food. He showed up and ate like there was no tomorrow. Very kind and very genuine person.
I want to be like Katt and Shaq!!!
Can i just say i love Katt Williams. After what i just read in the comments and what Sherri just said proves why. He is God centered, spiritual and one of the biggest humanitarians . I pray he continues to be forever blessed. He looks fantastic btw😊
Salute to Katt Williams
I absolutely adore Kat!!!!!💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
He actually looks younger than he did 20 years ago!
👑🔥
One of the top comedians of the last 25 years...Chappelle and Kat are my number 1's
I like Sherri but she embarrassing herself , kat don't want her
intelligent content informing content so real. Katt is one in a million
He’s gotten more and more handsome as he ages.
Katt williams soo funny 😂😂😂😂
I see his peace shining and its beautiful and attractive and very contagious even if u an atheist if u can see having prayer and god in ur life brings u to this then surely u want it believer or not xx
Didn't he get beat up by some kids
I Love Katt so much❤💙💙❤
That's one FUNNY MAN. 😂😂😂❤❤❤
Katt is a comedic genius!!
Am I the only one noticing the unspoken chemistry here?? They both look smitten. Or maybe I’m over analyzing.
I have been a forever fan!! This man is so deserving of this and more. So happy this interview stayed positive - thanks for that Sherri. Way too many vipers out there who bait guests in interviews only for them to go left. Katt is brilliant, repeat BRILLIANT, on stage and as a scripted actor! Anyone who has the luxury of being in his presence, is given an opportunity to harness his light and it's shameful when it's squandered. He's such a pure and authentic guy. He looks amazing and you can tell he FEELS amazing. BRAVA on this interview!! Now let me go check out these Dark Matter tickets!!
I know Katt Williams and he used to go by the name of cat in the hat. We used to perform at the The end zone Oakland California back in the early 1990 I wonder why Katt Williams did not tell the world that our friend passed away our friend name is . Darrell d militant.. he used to open up for Katt Williams so if I ever see Katt Williams I would ask him why I found out the hard way I mentioned his name on YouTube and somebody said that he died. No YouTuber social media . I know one day if Katt Williams does not address he will have a nearest breakdown or something.😮😮 He needs to tell the world Intel the loved ones that he's sorry he did not say anything when he passed away cuz I'm sure if Katt Williams pass away before d Daryl . Militant. He would have said something with tears in his eyes. This brother was a good man . If they everything make a movie we both should be featured in the movie 🎥🎥 rest in peace my brothers from another mother. Courtney g.
LOL YAL ARE BLESSED I CAN'T TALK REGULARLY RIGHT NOW LOL I REALLY WANT TO SCREAM LOL DANG IT IT'S JUST A DATE LOL YAL TRYING TO MAKE IT ALL A  DATE LOL MR.WILLIAM'S LOL I LOVE THE HAIR AND MISS.SHERRIIE I LOVE YOU SO I LOVE THE SHOW.
I will always LOVE KATT no matter what! ❤❤❤
He wasn’t flirting. He called her a “siren”… 😂
I just want to be invited to the wedding.
There you go Sherri... Katt Williams, the next best thing to your life long fantasy with Prince.
I love this man ❤ god bless him
He’s so smart and witty. I love his demeanor and confidence. My favorite comedian.
3:14-3:15 whoever said that no is a hater
"That was supposed to be my pimp break"😂😂😂😂😂
Katt looking good 👀
I love Katt Williams
Why would anyone want to date her ?
Long time fan!!You look healthy, strong, happy and at peace!! Keep up the great work. You are phenomenal!!!❤❤❤
That is what Humanity is about ❤
The audience is unbearable.  This is why I like longform podcasts.
1 of the best comedians about today as he previously stated how the fuck has he not got a tv/Netflix special?.hes also seems like a fantastic human.❤….thanks for making me laugh man 👏👏👏👏
I love Katt Williams. I can tell by the way he thinks and expresses himself that he's authentic, as real as they come.
Love and much respect to you Kat
i love katt but he be contradicting himself.  talking bout the universe has a way of working,  praying on god and THE  BANKING SYSTEM.
Is Kat mad or not . Can’t read him
Always liked Katt...great to hear what a genuine good person he is
When did they give “Hams!” A show??
Hmmmn so u didn't look in her eyes bcuz you remembered d siren lol❤
Love seeing him❤
FLUSH 2
Katt will always be my favorite.
A great spirit and a great mind
They let him back in ,,...i don't trust it so i'm prepared ...like i wasn't prepared for them killing DMX this chick here?.....bruh
I LOVE Katt Williams!
I'm sure prince installed a lot into him
That chain tho 🙏🏾 this guy is amazing
Katt is such a Virgo 😂 he’s always in his head. The blessing and curse of being a Virgo ♍️
Damn, Katt looks good!🫢
I am German and I love Katt Williams too.
We really do have a 20 year connection with you, Katt! You're the man.
Katt all day!💯💯💯
I ❤️ me some Katt Williams. He's one of the few that I split a side for. For decades. Also ❤️ Sherri for celebrating him this way. You can tell he is truly gifted and a nice guy. Shocked but not surprised he hung out w the likes of Prince, RIP.
He has the best name KOOL KATT. IM NOT A FAN OF CELEBRITIES BY NO MEANS BUT TO ME KATT IS DEFINITELY AN EXCEPTION TO MY RULE.  THEY TRIED TO MAKE HIM CRAZY BUT HE IS SO FAR FROM UNTIL IT SCARES THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF THOSE WHOSE CANT UNDERSTAND HIM.  THE 2 PEOPLE THAT I COULD JUST KICK IT WITH AND KNOW IM IN A GOOD SPACE WOULD BE KATT AND SEMMORE . THEY REALNESS IS A+
Matt Williams is aging so well
I'm a comedian sherri, you and Manny other black female comedians have been my guide. Please let me on to your show so other people can know me.
Those tickets sold out at Winstar before I could pull the up😢
Katt is a flirt and I love the chemistry 😆🤣
Thanks Sherri for showcasing Katt at his finest, and I do mean he is looking extra fine! Love how he has become so grounded! Love the hair too!!
Katt is the best
He knows what she had to do to get to where she’s at and will not be seduced by the siren, but I think he still cares for and respects her. He’s well aware of how the industry works.
I think Katt Williams is the real Slim Shady He is so shady.
This was so sweet. I loved every moment
I love SHERRI and KAT WILLIAMS
So careful and thoughtful of every word he uses. Love it
Sherri looking real good for some reason
Really?  The Micah Sierra "Katt" Williams is taken!  As in COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP TAKEN Sherri!!
Katt looks terrific. God bless u kid praise Jesus
Katt is blushing ???

He Looks AMAZING ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love you. We met at a Grizzlies game in Memphis ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Wow Kat looking mighty handsome these days 😂
This man is so wise. We ❤ you Katt.
That makes sense. Prince and Katt act just alike.
Katt is a sharp dude… some of those analogies he threw out were amazing
Karmic Account!!!!!
Amazing work 🙏🙏🙏
Love Mr. Williams. Make a girl smile and you got her for life
Kat want that hole & 1 lol
Katt now he getting old he cant handlee all those breast he was bkushing hard
I need Kat to tour in the uk 💯
Katt looking good seems like such a genuine person.
Wait a minute did she just shoot her shoot
I personally can relate to several things that he's gone through ! And I know that you can't believe everything you hear about people. And after hearing the issue regarding his ride from PDX with his companion, and being treated wrong ! I was so upset, and I nobody knows exactly what happened ! But I do know that "there's a lot of foul file, and wrongful"things going on here in PORTLAND,ORE right now ! Those people don't speak for everyone here, and he's obviously staying on track ! Great comedian !
Katt rehearses at home because Cedric The Entertainer used to steal his jokes during rehearsal
Everyone in the industry knows kats gay
He's a beautiful human being.  My two favorite comics, of all time, are Katt, and Patrice.  They are/were the only two that truly appreciated truth.
Katt you need to come to the “O”.
Katt is so classy... the ONLY comic I pay to see in person‼️
I thought you were meeting me there 😂😂
I love how you acknowledge God in everything you do!! This is a great blessing!! Much love and blessing to you and your family my brother!
Man, I love this guy...:)
He said u are a siren water kingdom demon
I love Katt Williams!!!
Excellent interview.....outstanding  comedians...love to see your success .
The universe has a banking system. So true. Good stuff!
Katt looks so good & healthy !! I love him !! He’s so effortlessly hilarious & humble
Katt could play Prince In a biography.....just paint his skin ....
I love this dress 😌😍
Love Katt!!! 🎉❤❤
My son and I absolutely love Katt Williams and we would love to be blessed by him

They both felt stood-up.. ! I wonder if that ever occurred to her?
Katt keep up the great laughs ❤
What Kat being bashful was so cute 🥰🥰🥰
Omg he looks healthy yea katt yea looking too good ❤❤❤❤❤
Siri would not have this so if it was not for Wendy Williams getting blacklisted for exposing the industry.
I’m a Katt fan for life! You can tell Katts a genuine guy because he bless people and don’t look for the media coverage or nothing in return! He’s not taken by Hollywood or his celebrity status😊
why isn't this uploaded in full hd?
Katt has always been the truth and been keeping it real since day dot. Everything that he has said, has come to pass!! Nuff love, Mr Williams ❤
I LOVE KW!! Saw him in Jacksonville, Fl and he totally rocked the stage!! He's a very humble man....Love you KW!
Two of my favorite people...Love ya Gurl... But I want to be around Katt Williams...I know him, but he doesn't know me... But...that's alright...Just simply praying for him...is a DATE...tho I'm old enough to be his Mother,  Step mother...Grand mother...does not MATTER...when he needs PRAYER...rest assured, He's going to  ''GET  IT''... Katt, in case you don't know it yet...🥀''AFRICA''🥀...is the..🎋''HOLY  LAND''🌻... The Excavation of the 4 rivers of the..🎋🌹🌱.''Garden Of Eden''🌴🌳...are in 🥀''AFRICA''🥀 The Bible says...in Revelation 17:5, that America is ''MYSTERY  BABYLON''...and We...African-Americans AKA...'Hebrew-Israelites'...will be Gathered by GOD...and taken back to Africa, 'though we're not Africans'... where the 2 tribes in America, will join the 10 tribes in Africa, Chapter 37...of Ezekiel...and 38-39...talks about  the up-coming War...WW-3...

If only Katt & Prince collaborated on something that would have been cool 😎
Every one of his comedy shows ive watched, listened, coughed til i threw up sometimes, but retained each word, line by line, word for word because hes so funny 😁, i used to do the same w/ Kevin Hart until he sold out to the illuminati 😢😢😢, now every thing he does just hurts my actual spirit, whereas Katt is a genuine light because he's real & wont sell himself to the darkness for fame & fortune, when HE WILL ACHIEVE EVERYTHING BECAUSE HE STAYS TO TO GOD ,HIMSELF AND WHATS IMPORTANT IN LIFE, MAY GOD BLESS EVERYONE 🙌 😉 😀
You can really tell her appreciation for him is genuine!  She really has an adoration for him!  Katy has brought me so much laughter ,  I appreciate him very much as well .
I just told you to on the straight up I really don't do go golf😂😂😂😂😂😂 should just keep it real.
I’ve ALWAYS loved Kat Williams!!! He has ALWAYS kept it 💯!!!
I wish she didn't take her breast off. I'm tired of everybody acting like you can't have big natural breasts. You can. No, it has nothing to do with hurt back or shoulders, none of that. If you wear the proper bra, you will be fine and won't be in pain. This has to do with clothes and the way they fit.
Authentically funny, Mr Katt Williams. Thank you Father God for helping us change our lives, and helping us help others.
Okay, I’m not the only one who needs Mr. Williams to elaborate on why he didn’t look Sherri in the eyes 👀. Mmmm🧐.
History in the making. Katt Williams would have never come on the Wendy Williams Show. Sherri’s show will always be remembered for this one.😮
Katt looks so good.. Wow! Proud of his resilience and drive! We need more Katt Willam’s specials and tours!
Yeah Katt
I knew i loved this man for a reason.
Idk why but he remind me of Prince
What had happened
His commentary is sweet 😢😮😅
I just love him I think he’s so handsome
I Love Katt William❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I see something here❤❤❤❤❤
Why the awkwardness at the end of the interview? And Katt seemed a little uncomfortable throughout.
My favorite comedian!! I love you Katt!!💜
He looks Amazing! Looks at Peace.. He got through some tough times & it’s amazing to see how Good he’s doing 🩵❣️
ONE OF THE GOATS BABY!! WE LOVE YOU KATT!! THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR GIFT WITH US SINCE FOREVER!!! Kept it real from the jump with us fans!!!. We love you big dog❤❤❤
Not every hero that wears a cape publicizes their humanitarian deeds to others! Remember we didn't know who superman was, his cape was always closed ❤
Awesome ❤ he is actually an intelligent man❤
Always been a fan of Katt Williams  and always will be
I can listen to Katt and Dave Chapelle talk all day. He is wise beyond words. I appreciate every word he says and he always pauses before he speaks.
❤❤❤infinite supply 2 u and us all Katt love u ❤❤❤❤
Katt looks good here.  handsome man .
Katt is so good at what he does. Super talented 🙌🏼🫶🏼
Noo katt don’t leave 😂😂😂
Y’all think he happy… he is struggling with being too real all the time lol he needs to just be funny and get over it
Ppl can’t interview him comfortably he is too bitter and stuck on this act he is doing for 10 years now
I love Katt Williams....🥰🥰🥰🥰
Amennnnnn brother. That’s amazing analogy. Let’s continue to put those deposits in people. Happy holidays
I love ❤ him sooo much and listening 2 him compose himself is halarious 😅😅😅
Sherri is working that dress.😊
Girl, when a brotha asks you on a first date to go golfing, consider it a joke or reaffirm it.
The way he said you know why lol. She knew why lmbo! Mad respect for this man.
i love katt i watch all his shows have not missed one
This man is a God sent.  The way he is blessed.. He is a man of God, so nothing that tries to tear him down will prosper.  I wish Wanda Smith understood that... she would probably still be employed! 😅😂  🤷🏾‍♀️
he is orlando brown
I love Katt, he is such a deep thinker.
Katt is looking so healthy!! Love this for him ❤
Oh how I LOVE ME SOME KATT WILLIAMS ❤❤😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
It's KaTT. TWO T's

He called her a "siren". I've met a couple..they'll lure you away❤.. He knows his weaknesses!😮😅
Katt Williams You Are Truly The Man And You Tell it Like it is And Mr.Katt Williams Keep On Doing What You Are Doing Plus Truly You Are Loved May God Bless You Katt Williams And Your Family Always ❤❤❤❤

Sowing and reaping.  Harvest will come. Blessed to be a blessing. He (Mr. Williams) understands the assignment.  ✝️
I noticed he wasn't looking at her too😂😂. Glad she pointed that out
I wish they were actually dating. They would make a beautiful couple
that Prince swagger did seem to rub off on Katt... I see it.
You haven't looked in my eyes all interview. Come on Sherri, you know why. Don't make me say it, we are on TV. You are a SIREN. 😂
Kat giving a whole sermon!!!!!, you gotta pay attention to how he is placing his words while trying not to offend anyone by talking about his hightented Spirituality... My WORD!!!
He’s so smart. Always a fan. He always tells the truth ❤❤ From a fellow lover of truth
LOVE! LOVE! Kat he is the funniest without a doubt. I quote “Let the haters do they job” all the time ❤
This legend, give him his flowers.
The most genuine, brilliant and talented guy in Hollywood
He's so intelligent... Katt is a inspiration ❤
He is so humble. I love him.
Awesome
3 likes is crazy with as many comments as are in this video
These two something private that’s real..Respect to both they personal relationships, but these two been some places together..😜
Don’t care what nobody says, this my dude.. Cat a real one.. Peace and blessings be upon him 🙏🏿🫶🏾🙏🏿
Sherri looking Good 😍
Enjoy listening to this man speak.
Why he flirting like that 💀
Kat, you looking fabulous!!!! Keep it up!
I Support all your amazing work!!! Your still my all time favorite comedian!
Katt was definitely trying to avoid looking directly into sherri's twin set cause they were definitely twinning 😂😂
If Katt Williams has a church.... I pray and believe the sermons will be great and inspiring. I will fly from wherever I am to see Katt Williams baptising 1000's of souls in the name of Jesus! I believe in you Bishop Katt Williams! Thank you Sherri you're Great! Love you!
Let's be honest,Katt Williams is the funniest comedian alive,wayyy funnier than the talented Kevin Hart. But I guess Katt Williams pissed off the wrong people and has been black balled.
Love this! I LOOOOVVVEEEE HIS CHARACTER!
We love you Katt
Sis why did you rip off the Wendy's show so bad. Could you not have tried to be original.
Now that’s PIMP energy bringing out those flowers!
Kat can make laugh😂 even when I am not trying.
That's a Awesome PRINCE SHARE,TY
Lovvvvvvvve him🫂😘🥰🙌🏿👑✊🏽🎂💯‼️
❤gotta love him..Flowers!!!
Sherri kinda 😍
How old is he now though?
Love Katt’s spiritual take on deposits.   I am so proud of Prince and how many lives he shaped behind the scenes.❤
He is correct!  The world is in a bad place! If the airplane was going down, they'd be begging for a soul saving word, a song, and a prayer of forgiveness!
Katt I'd the Real deal ❤
That's So CRAZY that Katt met Prince & influenced by him cz I have a ex who was like a mixture of Katt Williams and prince in the looks & personality department & his favorite singer was Prince omg wtf!
I love this guy. He looks so truly a genuine person and an awesome terrific comedian
❤ love it!
The good thing about Katt Williams he going to be honest  about what ever and that is good quality in a man.
Kat Williams is loved 1m views in 2 weeks
Oh my God....Katt you look goooooooooddddddd!!!!!!!! Love your hairdo......please take me to golf instead😂
Katt is a whole vibe. Love his attitude ✨
He looks great!!!!
I think Kat Williams is the most funniest comedian and sorry 🤦🏿‍♀️🙋🏽‍♀️ funnier  then Kevin heart . But I love Kevin’s movies , however, not his stand up.
Katt look Good💙💚
I love me some Katt Williams no matter what has gone on in his life. He is one of a kind. He is in a good place now...🙌🏽❤️🙏🏽
Two faves, Prince & Katt! 💝
looking like Burna Boy
Love me some Katt. He’s a legend and a genius. 🔥🔥😍
Amen   on Kate's outlook on giving ❤
That boy said u a siren that was deep if you don’t know what that means it was a Greek mythology word for woman that was fascinating but also dangerous in the some way.
09:49 i will never forget Charla said she looks like the Tasmanian Devil
DO Y'ALL KNOW WHAT A ""SIREN 🚨🚨🚨 IZ???🤨🙄🤔🤔🤔?????.....
I love that Katt is intentional when he answers questions and it’s very attractive
Katt hair is fake but it fits him💯💯
I almost skipped this interview. But I had to listen and watch an updated version of Katt Williams. Great guy and comedian. Congrats to Cheri on her show as well. She too is looking really good. Black lives do matter after all.
He's aging gracefully ❤
Katt I love your locs🎯
So intelligent ❤
Have been a fan of Katts forever! I got my ticket to go see him in Richmond! ❤️
I am so in love with Katt  Williams. Ms. Sherri, my birthday is coming up Jan 9th, can you PLEASEEEEEEEEEEE introduce me to Katt Williams.
Miss Shepherd you look outstanding
What an interview I love this so much ❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love me some kat Williams
KATT LOOKING HEALTHY. GREAT!
I lovedddddd this interaction Sherri you are amazing and Katt Williams is always great 😊 so glad to see him in this space.
7:00 I love this. He is the real deal. I’ve always been leery of folks who are always doing things in front of a camera.  No one but the person you’ve blessed needs know. Continued success to you Katt Williams!
Yes Kat! My favourite stand up 🫶🏽⭐️
I like that look he is looking really good
Katt is my all time favorite comedian. He's also very smart and you can tell he has a great heart. It all makes sense with him and Prince, because for some reason he always reminded me of him. I also hear Prince was very generous. They both were never boastful about doing so much for others.
It's heartwarming to see this side of Katt Williams. I thought him very harsh, brass, and very astute. This warm side of him is so sweet to behold. I felt hearing how generous he is inspires us to be more generous as well. He's quite a special human being. He may be rather underrated. He is league with a powerful group of comediennes who mixed humor with huge doses of truth, like Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Dave Chappelle, D.L. Hughley,
He wearing a costume?
It is because of this man, that I can giggle at myself. Key to unlocking the cage I was in. Given I've Googled his real name and have many personal events to back this up, I hope it doesn't read pretentiously when I say this man is a Modern day Prophet. I'm continuously thankful. 🕊️
Men and their man-plaining 😅😅😅😅
👍♥️
He's right, if you keep your hands tight, nothing can come in or out.
Katt knows how the universe works! He is blessed, indeed. He deserves to be up there!
I like. This interview ‼️🔥🔥
Love him, smart guy too
Kat looking real good
I love that way you explained that Katt thanks for the reminder ❤😊
he loooks so goodt!
I love Katt. He's a good dude.
Team Katt❤
Ungrateful 😂😂😂😂
I love Katt!
This is such a delightful exchange. It's like my heart has been fed a delicious meal.
That is not katt Williams.. look more like a cloned to me..don’t be fooled
Love you both Katt and Sherri  🫡.
Ummmmm….that was so cute!! 🥰
Love Katt!!! One in a million.
Not Katt calling Sherri a siren😂😂😂
Sherri looks amazing ❤

I’ve never watched Sherri’s show but I loved her on The Real. She’s so beautiful and magnetic. Great interview. I’ll continue to watch ❤
Genius of a man!
Katt is so sexy
This interview segment definitely earned these numbers. Katt is the Prince of Comedy. If he doesn’t take Sherri out I will. 😊
Katt looks great! He looks handsome with his locs and his whole countenance seems lighter and happier. I hope he continues to flourish personally and professionally!
I love him ❤
Love Mr Williams 😊
I love Katt ❤
We love you Katt! ❤
Katt always been a real deal playa , never caved in to the Hollywierd agenda they tried to push on him . Glad he’s receiving his flowers he deserved 🤌🏾💯
He’s talking about manifesting ✨✨✨
so happy for my daddy!! they been tryna cancel him out for years! i’m so glad he is getting what he been so deserving of, for so many years. def a real 🥷 & comedian! love love love him!
He definitely looks a lot better! You love to see it!
He’s always been my favorite comedian! He is one of the BEST comedians of our generation, I’ll die on that hill. He is a true genius. People don’t realize if he wanted to be in Kevin Hart’s position, he could… I’ll let y’all think on that.
Glad I watched this because now I have a whole new respect and perspective of him. Seems like a humble cool dude.
, Colossians‬ ‭4:6‬ ‭NIV‬ [6] Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.  Without plugging it to scripture,, this was spoken. Our limp shows our time with GOD
Kat done  smashed before
he didn't look her in the eyes because he's cheating towards the camera.
He looks great. He looks so refreshed. I can tell he is in a good place.
Katt is an all time great.
he got that method man face n wayne dreads
they would make a fantastic couple!
Katt❤ it's Friday 😂
💙💙
Good video nice time
👍
I absolutely love this interview. I am a die hard KW fan and it's great to see him in an 'interview if comfort'. Additionally, happy to see SS's unique show peronality- much better than producers trying to force even some WW influences
He really looks great
😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is funny as hell katt one of the goats
Kat is shy around Sherri. He is infatuated
❤️❤️❤️
I absolutely adore Katt and  this interview ❤
Katt can spit game.
I wonder if Katt and Hazel will find themselves back together 🤷🏿‍♀️🤷🏿‍♀️🖤🖤🖤
Nice❤
Loving his hair like that 🥰
✨🤍✨🤍✨
He the best funny funny
I Iove Katt, but I was disappointed by his show in  Detroit-Dark Matter. The acts were subpar. I felt like he and those he brought on tour were using us as the first run. I really wish Katt would have done the whole show with just himself.
Kat is handsome funny and great heart
💝😊
I love you, Mr. Katt Williams!❤❤❤ I have watched your Comedy Shows at least forty times during my lifetime (yes, I'm a SENIOR/young person😂) and this Interview at least 20 times! I just love you! Next time you're in Miami I will love to see your show!! Best of continued GOD blessed good fortune to you.❤ you are absolutely 💯, the best and I genuinely love you and praying for the very best for you. Also, Mr. WILLIAMS. YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, HEALTHY, AND WONDERFUL!!!❤❤ And I love you, so much!
He looks good 😊
Always loved you Katt. Never doubted. You are a genius. Thanks Sherri. love you too.
Katt aint lying I give to everyone and I am never broke Truth spoken.
No, every time I see her I see a woman trying to find a man. I see a woman who stole a show from someone who called her out. I see a woman recycles stories over and changes the people in them. She’s washed.
When did he get dreads tf
Man! I really love Katt Williams!
Black folks always talking in the background & answering for folks! Sherri said, 'we can do the golf thing again' and somebody sad NO from the audience. Fools! LOL!!!!!
👍
The goat 🐐
Watched this clip for Katt and love his energy. Sherri on the other hand did not make me want to watch more of her show. She seems so... like the girl that was never popular that is now in the spotlight?
KAT YOU LOOK sooo healthy, full and wonderful!!! Keep glowing ❤
Woooooo 🎉❤
Did anyone else notice how he kept blushing when he looked at her?
Katt is in my top 3... BUT!... WTH is going on with his hair or hairline?... Everybody gonna keep ignoring that he's been hiding it for the past 4 comedy specials....?!?!
Love the interview Kat and Sherri!
They so cute together ❤
I love Kat Williams!! I'm happy to see him in his beautiful truth!
He looks great, she looks great and they look great together
I love me some katt😂❤
Thry still have electricity
I’m cheesing so hard like it’s me 🙈🙈🙈
Katt is getting a little thic and aging like fine wine. He is so fine to me baaaabbbby!!!! 🥰. Did you catch that he said she was a siren? Is Sherri a mermaid? Is that why he didn’t look at her in the eye?
Katt needs to be protected at all costs.
I need a house Kat  🏠  I watch all your comedy shows.
He is so cute, talented and funny🎉😊❤
Very nice

Smooches and continued success Mr. Katt Williams and Sheri Shephard. ❤❤
Sometimes you have to go thru somethings to break from somethings😊
Kat was acting as bashful  adolescent with Sherrie.
Totally agree. Katt looks better than ever and seems very happy with his life.
<3 katt Williams. <3
I went to that tour it was excellent!
Katt's last show was everything! Presented a lot of great talent & stepped aside so they can get their shine! Humble Katt!
Katt looking goodt❤, Sherri show is awesome❤
Amen. He is amazing
Way2Go Katt. Luv u shawty.  I need a 🚗 if u have a gifted ❤

Kat 😂😂😂❤
Something different about him!!! Humble
A pimp n a thimble 😂 I love katt Williams ❤
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️
Hi Sherri this episode was really great.  I appreciate the credit you gave to Mr. Katt Williams he definitely deserves it.  I saw him in person many years ago.  The audience went completely crazy we couldn’t stop laughing.  I love him he’s one of a kind amazing person/ comedian who has come through generations and still is the greatest to many people ❤️💕❤️🌷🌷🌷
Awesome Comedian !  Glad to see him doing so well.
This was cute, alot of flirtatious energy.
🥰🥰😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰
This was funny lol
Kat looks healthy. I can barely recognize him. 😊 He look like he could be tank brother lol
Katt looks so healthy!
Saw his tour/show last year…fucking hilarious. Had a great time.
Continued Blessings Katt❤️
Love seeing Kat looking so good!
She put the girls front and center for him
The universe has a banking system, the more positive deposits the more your withdrawals will be undenide🌌 💯
I love how real Katt is! ❤❤❤
❤ Katt Williams ❤
Katt you look FABULOUS per usual 🥰 May you continue to be blessed because YOU are a blessing and bring joy and laughter into this crazy world.
Well done
Good
Katt is my Favorite Comedian of all time. I guess deep down I always knew he was a genuine person ❤
How much water is in that cup he's sipping from?
Nice one broh
🖤🦅
Good
That photo of Katt he kinda looked like Spike Lee  It's the face
Nice video
I LOVE KATT WILLIAMS HE IS SO FUNNY. DEFINITELY FUNNIER THEN KEVIN HEART. I HATE HOW THEY DOWNPLAY AND UNRECOGNIZE KATT! GIVE HIM HIS FLOWERS! WELL DESERVED
Sober kat Williams im all for it. And by sober I mean a completely different man compared to Katt I saw in person in 2013 and got arrested at my target.
"Come on!" The audience is messy 🤣🤣🤣
Nice a man but very funny jokes like this 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😊
Sherri looking good ah damn ❤
Super i like❤❤❤
I DON'T HAVE TWITTER EITHER DAVE CHAPPELLE 😂😂😂
💖
Phenomenal  interview. Thanks Sherri!
Kat Williams has a cool personality.
COMPTON...CARSON...
🗿
He gave boosie I believe 10k or more when he got out of jail. He a real one
I am not mad at Sherry for shooting that shot, Have fun, "golfing."
Wow, interesting interview. I like Sherri. Not a big Kat fan, but Im here for it. 😊
I just love his rendition of giving and SHALL be giving back to you.
Katt is a virgo with a cap moon; if you do him dirty, such as "steal" his joke (especially before he can perform in big time) you are not only dead to him, he strategizes a manner to avoid that shit ever happening again. If you ever have become "dead" to a virgo, then you know... 😉
Ok....."siren." The love is genuine. ❤
Katt Williams is a LEGEND 👊🏾😁
Correction he’s not your friend he’s just a guest making money, they don’t consider you relevant keep it real!
Love Kat 💋
He is a very nice man
I love the place he's in. I love the energy. I love his mindset. I'm here for it all.. Many blessings to you Katt Williams. I always have and always will be a huge fan.
I’m so thrilled to see @ Katt Williams glowing and floating!! Chile he looks like he’s been on a sabbatical with God for like three years!😂😂😂. Thank you @ Sherri Shepard for bringing out this LEGEND of comedy on your show. Girl you look like a Siren for real!😂😂 You look really great girl. Alright… since I’m really being evicted in a couple days I better @ Katt and see if he can help. 😊 no.. but for real I am getting evicted and the Sheriff will be at my door in two days. Help me Jesus. Love you Katt, love you Sherri❤❤😂😂
he looks good, I like his hair like this...
My God continue to bless Katt
Straight Jewels.
Katt is one of the most talented comics out there and his acting is cool too 👑
very nice excellent video
You 2 got some chemistry. What’s up sherrikat ❤❤❤❤
The dialog at 5:10 in regards to how he relates prayer to being performance ready was so dope to me. Katt has always been a great relayer of connecting God with human experiences and thats one of the reasons I love him most. 💜🐐🏁🙏🏾
I❤kattwilliams, he is so down to earth, my favorite comedy.
Katt looks good. The therapy is working.
His people needs to get in touch with her people, make it happen 😁❤
3 different greens on 💪🏿🔥
Yall got some CHEMISTRY on that stage!!! He can't keep still😅😂
men
This was absolutely fantastic! I also appreciate Sherri for acknowledging and praising him while he's still around. This recognition was much needed.
I can see Sherri and Kat as a couple. I hope it does lean more into that. He's been bitten by the smitten bug!❤😂 I love it....Kat is a cool fella!
How beautiful
Did he get dreads installed? Like on some Fetty wap shit?
Katt Looks Absolutely Great!!
Wise man.
I love both of them
He is so humble ❤❤❤
One thing i admire about Kat he does amazing things for people and never talk about it
Katt always has seemed like a real dude
5:50....I wish I could. They stole alot from me. Watching them frauds on stage. Stealing my thought process. But god bless them tho....bahhumbug.
Great interview❤!
he looks great, wow!!!!!!!!!!
He is styled nicely here ❤
Love seeing these different angles of the Legendary Prophetic Katt Williams 😮 deposit/withdrawal  cause/ effect
Can’t resist the truth
Nah who said No, let my girl get her  😂😂😂
Absolutely my favorite comedian ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kat Williams looking refreshed, taking care of himself mentally and physically it shows 👏🏿 keep it up my brotha!!!!
I love Katt Williams ❤❤❤
Kat looking good asf ❤especially with the locs
Welp....we finally see what Katt's type is 😊
SHERIE TRYING 2 FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUK!!!!!!!
He looks great
“I thought u was going meet me there “🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
katt Williams wiz Khalifa and snoop look just alike wtf
Cat is awesome 👍
Good
Am I the only one that didn’t see it as chemistry but as highly uncomfortness because of the golfdate information? Sirens smoothly seduce their prey and when they’re in deep waters, they drown them.. Probably Katt meant that, the show was the deep water.
He’s looking good & healthy. He got a lil weight on him & everything ✊🏾
He is the man who cares and love woman❤
Katt Williams and Prince are the same person
All I can think of is Wanda smith and broccoli 🥦 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We love you kat , you’re an irreplaceable legend . He deserves his flowers now , although folks do the apposite.
Salute to the both of these beautiful professional human beings.
Wow
.
1.1 million views 😀🥳 only Katt could do this!! Breakfast club better invite him for their listenership to increase.
The cameraman is out of line @5:04 😂😂😂
Nice 🙂
Katt is so well spoken.
I've not always been a fan of Katt, but he has always been very funny. He has managed to allow me to like and dislike him over and over again, but ultimately he's a great dude. Sherri is doing awesome!!
good
Yo, what did he take when he sat down😂 He was smooth wit it😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We ❤ katt williams
I wish he would bless my platform
I danced with Prince too Key Club memories
😂😂😂 omgness this is too good lmaooo
Hott damn she fine asf...ooooooo weeeeee miss Sherri ❤❤
What channel is this on
So nice and lovely
Man, Katt looking well. Love to see it. I remember whem he had some rough years. And then was running around with Suge Knight for some reason 🤣🤣🤣
Katt definitely hit b4
I love that her show is still growing!!!!! She is such a joy to watch. I’m glad that they gave her time to find her own beat!!!! Very happy that her show isn’t gossipy.
Iz kat will ray cash or charston white
and this is how I found out Sherri was short
I LOVE THEM BOTH. SO HAPPY SHE HAS HER OWN SHOW.
I'd miss putting my face in those pillows too.
I love Katt❤
Katt, why can’t WE date?!
I sense some romantic tension between these two hmmmmm🤔🧐
Katt is looking good! One of my favorite comedians ❤
Love the locs on Katt.❤
Wow Katt! Much respect ❤️❤️
I love Katt❤😂🎉😊
Shoulda went with a forest green shirt katt
He doesnt look the same, like this is the industry replacement. What if they legally own kat williams name and now only need someone who can act and look the part... just something i cant stop thinking about... or maybe this is kat
The healthiest you've ever seen Katt!!! No more cocaine/crack or ecstacy. 🫡
Oooop! They cute together! The chemistry was DEFINITELY all up in the vicinity! 😂💛
I love seeing him healthy and in a better place 😍😍😍😍
KATT DA GOAT! GLAD TO SEE HIM  THRIVING AND SURVIVING ❤
I love Katt Williams even more learning that he sponsored Melba Moore's STAR on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Love, love, love him for that.
They are low key in Love not Lust... They would be dynamic and unstoppable together as they are apart!
Katt is real even among the lost he called her a siren, wow hes a beast
She got her own show. Thats dope
They both look amazing ❤
I like that formula
Super dope him havin the legends like Mark Curry & Tommy Davidson on the tour, but also Tacarra Williams who is EXTREMELY talented & the world needs to know her!
He’s definitely a higher being 🥰
Good video nice time
Love the Katt❤
I was Katt’s Limosine Driver in Las Vegas . We were parked in front of popeye’s chicken and a homeless Family with Children came by me . I felt so emotional that I gave this Family everything I had in my Pockets ; I had no idea Mr. Williams was watching me . Mr.William ,Ran out of the limousine rush toward me and told me ;”I saw what you did for that family that was amazing .” His Comments got me tearing then he shook my hand and handed me $400.00 . Then he went to that Family and blessed them Big time . In addition ; there were a group of little kids begging out side of Popeyes , Mr.Williams walked up to them and handed to those kids 1000.00 each he told them go home you don’t have to beg Today . Mr.Williams is an AMAZING HUMAN BEING . God bless You Sir !!
aint nobody gonna say something abt that sharpie Kat used to ink in that patch of hair under his lip?
Ok ok but we are just skipping past that pant and shoe color clash combo?🤣🤣🤪
Kat digging u Sherri!
I have always loved Katt. When you give willingly God will bless you deservingly.
They both looking good and younger these days katt is in another head space seems more focused.Hes very humble and raw keeps it real all the time giving and doesnt make it a public thing the same thing prince did.
Katy look good with locs but when he start growing them lol
Katt. Is a beautiful funny soul.  I hope they hook up
5:24 Well put
Nice
Nice
When did Katt Williams get locs.
Definitely one of the Most DYNAMIC GOATS of Comedy for sure. He's one of a kind like Prince. I never knew that he was inspired in any way by the "little Prince" (Temptation).  Respect Mr. Katt Williams. Enjoy your blessings Bruh, you deserve all them.
Kat appears to be very insightful. There also is alot of chemistry on that sofa. I like the way she slid in " I love you!" Yessass we are here for it!❤️
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Kat one of the best comedian ever😅 really happy for him
Katt made me love stand up comedy. I have never laughed so much at any show as i have laughed at his.  Truly hilarious. Love this guy.
I just fell In like of him he's  genyen  😅❤
Kat looks amazing and healthy.👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿🥳
OMG!  I see a new side to Katt.. he is just soo cute to me!  How sweet and humble he is just warms my heart! 😘❤️❤️ God Bless and keep doing it the way you do!!
Hi
That was so cute he was really blushing.😊😊😊❤
Katt is a legend
Came a long way from fighting 7th graders and slapping Target employees
Fake dreads? Lol bruh
Best comedy show ever. Dark Matter tour was  🔥  I went on my birthday.
Kat knew he got Sherri when he was explaining the deposit into the Universe.  The way he smirked had me screaming 😂😂😂  Sherri: 😘😘😘 Kat: Got er 🎉🎉🎉
My all-time favorite comedian 🎉❤
Katt forever. Also, 💕the whole audience loved Sherri's set for D-Nice's Club Quarantine.
Great interview. ❤Kat
YOU AINT GOTTA ASK ME TWICE ❤😂🤣😂
I’m just gonna say it I think Katt and Sherri would be an amazing couple , they look exceptional together.
How he get dreads 😒😂
Her body still looks off after getting her boobs done
Now i wanna know why cat didnt look sherry in her eyes👀
Y’all look good together
Loved her on everybody loves Raymond
He seems to be live and popping [on] stage (maybe) because of alcohol ... [off] he had nothing much to say @ Sherri's ...  ppl was soooo pumped to see him ...  then NOTHING ... shy, maybe!?!?!? 🫣
Sherri looks F’N Phenomenal 😍😍😍😍
Katt got his groove back! Haha! Looking like my Rasta uncle!
Blessings ❤ full of wisdom
4:00 Did not know Katt Williams’ mentor was Prince but then that explains it.   They both are mentally tough, very talented, fashionably savvy and intelligent (black) people! Prince is music royalty. Katt Williams is a Royal in comedy.
He seems so serious, i hope they get together seriously
That dude always dressed horribly 😂😂
Phenomenal Man ❤❤❤
Such an handsome man
You'll got chemistry, big time
It’s so good to see Katt ❤❤❤
No words but GREAT
I feel like they did it before
They would make a cute couple. He looks good with the braids vs perm. 🥰
Had no idea about this channel I’m subscribed to the two funny mommas and now this one. I believe I heard about this broadcast and love katt williams❤🎉 and Melba Moore is the shiot…baby come to me cause I love you ❤️ 🤟🏾 thinking of you! My bad that’s Regina bell but Melba Moore been so long is the cut❤great work Sherri!
I would like to know if Kat Williams ever showed some charity towards the kid who beat his ass, what ever happened to that kid.
513 🤞🏾💜
Katt got on 7 different greens🤦🏾‍♂️
❤️🫅🏾🤴🏾🫡 yall amaze me everytime😂 so beautiful to see the greats spread this type of motivation amongst us all, Comedy king easily gives best realest knowledge ever frfr bless yall💯 and thank yall
Katt was getting tried of people saying he looks like Charleston White 🤣🤣🤣Katt been hitting weigjts
🌴🌺 You guys measure up!!!! Y’all would make a cute couple!!❤
Katt is a legend....and funny A.F....
Absolutely not 😂😂😂
I love this interview. Hometown legend, Cincinnati, OH! Sherri’s gonna get that golf date ok! They look good together for real tho, not sure if either one of them are dating anyone at the moment
❤
The goat in my eyes
Loved this interview. Love Katt Williams. I'm still here for the conversation and thank you Sherry for publicly acknowledging his generosity!
Shout out to Katt but damn bro went and bought some dreads 😅lol 😂
I think I wanna see them together 🤔🥰
Why kat Williams dressed like 2chains
Wow katt looks really healthy
Katt Williams looks great!🙏🏽💖
KAT FINALLY TOOK HIS OATH...😢.
Katt said them ta-ta’s is ta-ta’ing and therefore he will not be looking you in your face.
Katt said you're a Siren 🤣🤣🤣 I hear ya Katt!! Pickin up what you puttin down partna.
I thought you was meeting me there 🤣
I waited and I waited 🤣
Katt Williams is so funny he said You was a Swan Full Of Ducklings 🤣
This why Sherri is loved respected. Thank you for kat in a positive light.
I honestly could see Katt and Sheri together!  Sheri would probably help him stay humble and Katt would show her a good time and help her loosen up (although she’s already very fun)!  They would definitely balance one another out!
Sherri is so got damm bad ❤️❤️👍🏽
The explanation of prayer.....Beautiful!
I love the way he considers his his responses before he gives it to whatever he is asked by whomever asked the question
My intrusive mind is picturing Katt blowing her back out 😂
Katt and Prince really could go for brothers.
Nice
How is Sherri 56 years old🔥🔥🔥
Loved the interaction with them both. 2 stars just shining between each other.
i recently got to see his show in norfolk va and it was great! also they look so cute they need to make a date happen
❤❤
I love Katt. He has always been genuine and nice. I met him when I was 18 at comedy club and he was so humble and cool. Keep going Katt!!! God bless you always.
Never met him yet,but he’s a great comedian! As to his generosity,i am a witness to it.Several years ago while at a comedy club in Atlanta,he reached into his pocket & gave a fellow comedian who was on hard times (The late Tonita Camp aka Dirty South) several hundred dollars from his pocket…He is also definitely a person who knows talent.He took a young comedian who was also going through some rough times,but was putting in work on the stage…A very very funny young lady…(Ms.Gin)& took her on the road with him & completely changed this young lady’s life around.I don’t care what anyone says about this brother,he is deserving of all the accolades he receives because he is an outstanding human being!
How he sat that cup down he knew what happen that night immediately 😂
He makes her laugh.  She L.O.V.E.S him!!
He's coming here to Pensacola tomorrow ❤❤ yay
Had a blck motor bike jacket, similar to the one he hve..bck in the (90
I don’t know if married or not, but Katy is seriously “In Like” of her!  It would be a beautiful thing.
Kat looking like a black pirate. Black Sparrow. Give me Kat and Eddie Griffin over Kevin Hart anyday
The greatest
I hate Sheri love Katt though
Hats off to his humble attitude and always being himself
He respect her ❤❤❤ from Michigan
♥️
This was a very Short Date Sherri and the Spark between you too it's Lighting the Stage 🎉 .. Wow plus you look amazing together trying to avoid looking at each other in the eyes ❤️❤️❤️❤️ ...
Mr. Katt Williams is always and will remain my best , one of the greatest craziest Comedian of All Times...
Aging like fine wine worlds greatest number one comedian
Katt...beautiful human....keep going!!!
I miss Prince
Katt is where it's At!
Matt & Sherry R where it's at..beauty...
I had the honor of meeting him everything she says  is true about Katt real people  Newnan Ga.
Omg he looks so handsome and healthy
Absolutely love me some Katt Williams very intelligent and funny brutha ❤
Desantis is unfit for government office and unqualified for us President. Vote against him.
Katt is not what the media portrays's him to be. Hes a very sweet person. When I see the media talk about him it makes me mad because I know him I performed with him. And Luenelle and my brother before he became hugh. Love you Katt stay true too self. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Pimp Chronicles 1 & 2 will always be legendary stand up shows I used to watch them so much I knew them by heart at one point it’s so great to see a different energy of an evolved, refreshed Kat Williams
Katt Williams?? So glad to see him doing well!
Sherri 🤤🤤🤤
Kat Williams look so healthy, cool, calm and collect!!! Such a wonderful soul he has🌞
I love Kat, he has always been one of my top comedians. Seeing him healthy and happy brings me joy ❤
His program was running slow. All the long pauses.
Love for this man since day 1... the realest 4evs❤
He looks great
Eddie Murphy started the comics wearing leather and it’s a trend they still do today.
you don't have to be tall Katt, you just need some of these boots ~ Prince
Katt you're looking great thanks for making us laugh!
Love katt
Love, love, LOVE me some Katt Williams!!!!  Being absolutely hilarious is only one of his very many wonderful qualities, the best one being REAL!!  There's nothing fake about the man - he is as real as real gets. Thank you Katt for the many years of me holding my stomach as I come up for air from laughing my azz off!! You look amazing btw.
Did you catch what he said you’re a siren? Or was it just me?🤣🤣
Kat!  You better ask that beautiful lady out 💐💘💘
Love this man. Sherri not so much.
Here for Katt! He is authentic and has good chemistry with Sherri 😊
Katt does have a bit of Prince’s demeanor in him. He’s so handsome! And Sherri looks damn good!
I love the prayer explanation, Katt! Private but powerful in public! Holla!
KAT 💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌🏼
I absolutely love this man! Of course ...love you too Sherri!

I love your videos.  Fun, positive, interesting.
Ur Outstanding 🤟🫅
She was trying to find the words he said, “ungrateful” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 he so funny
“You don’t anything more than what you already have.” Katy Williams. That is a beautiful affirmation!
7:26 the law of even exchange- give and take- reciprocity 💯
Oh Lort, the chemistry between the two! I love it.
Nigga blowing me with the 3 different greens 💀😭
Lmao I needed to laugh a little!  I love Kat Williams!!
Katt seem really feminine.
That is soo wild that seconds before she mentioned Prince I was thinking Katt's demeanor sort of reminded me of Prince's demeanor in Tavis Smiley interviews. As soon as that crossed my mind they brought up Prince. 💜
He looked so uncomfortable. Scorpio women can be super masculine.
He looks great now. The hair really fits him. He actaully looks kinda hot
Nice
Kat Williams never bent over for the fame and riches and they tried to destroy him through media and he didn't budge 🔥🔥🔥💪🏾💯
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"GOD BLESS 🙏🏽🖤🙏🏽🤲🏽❤❤❤HIM ALWAYS 🙏🏽🤲🏽🖤❤
all of a sudden Kat has all black beard. it was grey last week
is this video really only in 480p ?
I wish they’d go ahead and date lol. I was blushing for them while watching 😍😍
are those green leather pants?
I love Katt through his ups and downs. Always authentic and so is Sherri with her cute self.
I Adore that man's brain and his comedy!! ❤ He is shy and reserved I love that!!
I love him! He's my favorite comedian.
KATT IS SO VERY HUMBLE. GOD BLESS YOU 🙌 🙏 ❤️
Katt 💯
Looks great with natural hair
Love you Katt! You are absolutely my favorite comedian! Can't wait to see you perform live!
she got the tig ole bitties in his face 😂
Kat built like an even shorter Kendrick Lamar.
She likes that man!
Next to Dave Chappelle Katt is the Goat
When did Katt Williams pull a Fetty Wap and get these damn faux locks
THIS is just like I tell folks you ONLY know what is shown. Glad he got on and we got to know something deeper about him. GoD can move and change anyone. His belief is stronger than the devils demands.
😂😂😂 & See What Happened Was....  😂😂😂😂😂😂 Love Katt Williams 😂. So Glad to See Him. May God Continually Bless Him with All His Wrongs to Be Right...   Love U Katt
Sherri is supa sexy ❤, beautiful, and a great person. I wouldn't look her in the eyes either. Katt's outfit and hairstyle is cool.
This is an old school gentleman right here.  Fellas, pay attention.
He dropped some nuggets.
Am happy for you kat grateful heart giver peace ✌🏾

Kat to the World 🌎 from London blessings
Nobody notice anything? Katt nervousness, those backhanded jokes Makin it heard that he dnt really want her around him, or that last moment comment about her being a siren... sounds lik that's y he didn't look n her eyes n reminded her that they were on tv... smh.

A lie vs the truth... I said this long ago
When he said on his last special.. the truth is just as strange as fiction... It's all what YOU Believe.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’m so jealous of Katt right now
Katt is a king. Been a king. Forever a king.
Sherrie finally got that reduction

07:17 "The universe has a banking system ...  it is imperative you put deposits in on a regular basis so that your withdrawal is never denied."  Facts!  Love Katt Williams. He is absolutely one of the GOATS and constantly spitting knowledge. 💯👍🏽🌠
before she mentioned Prince I thought he had the same personality as Prince in this interview. Same mannerisms, etc.
Who wants a women that left her husband n threw  the baby away
❤
Katt looks good
He went and got the weave😂😂😂

I just love katt so much he's funny and so awesome ❤❤❤❤
He didn’t let Hollywood get him like the rest of them did
Katt is the only comedian that can out compete, the latest, all time, allstar greatest Red Fox. I miss him so much. Sherri looks like she smells like warm cookies. Happy Katt shared an interview, with the adorable Sherri.
OMG love Katt!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Surprised her show still on
I could definitely see the Prince influence. They both have that undeniable confidence.
Love you katt
Girl put the flowers in water
We love katt
Sherri is fine as hell
First Katt looks AMAZING.... Second Sherri looking at him like she wanna eat him up
I like that banking system analogy
They honestly make a good couple. They got that vibe.
He called her a siren....Let's just say, he got a THANG for Ms. Sherri.....
“So, tell us what you cook Katt”
They losing it! Katt has that effect on people!❤
I could listen to him alllll day ❤
He is very intellectual❤
Very wise❤
What a beautiful person
He's ah Mazing ❤
I Fukkkkn Love Kat you too Sherri 😂❤
We ❤ Katt Williams downnnnnn omg he is my favorite 🤩

The chemistry between the two you them is so obvious and the whole time she was blushing I was blushing for her
🐐
Sherri’s looking fantastic!!
Wow he looks so guuuud
🎯🤌🏾
Katt will always be my dude!  He is definitely one of the comedy GOATS of all time!  He is in a class all by himself so he can share the light with other great comedians.
Sherri looks good and Kat looks good, so if they dated now, that would look good!
Thirsty
Love your hair Katt❤.
Kat looks healthy and I love that for him👏🏾
😂😂 Kat said Sherri is a Siren. Hell that's why he wasn't looking her in her eyes. 😂😂
Cat should be a preacher
I always thought Sherri had sex appeal  & I love her teeth
How you go from a perm yesterday to dreads the next?
He starting to look like himself. That’s good! Stay healthy Katt! God bless!
😂😂😂😂 “I thought I was meeting you there”😂😂😂😂
Looking good looking good there lil man
My absolute favorite!
❤kat
He looks good❤
The BEST in the game.... LOVE KATT!!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰
Love you Katt ❤❤❤
What was  wrong with KAT teeth 😮
Katt called her a "siren" 😆.. he definitely hit that before
Katt looks great!
That Golf date was an insider. They was gonna smash lol
Kat you looking good ❤
Now Sherri....  What y'all got going on?  We gone find out so you might as well spill it guh.  The energy was very cute and Katt wasn't ready!  Get him beautiful
A siren. 😆
😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥
“The universe has a banking system” love the analogy❤
What does he look like Whoopi Goldberg with a goatee?
Love him
Katt looking like a mini marshmallow lynch🤣😂🤣nothing but love for Katt!
That not Kat that's a clone 😮
If uncomfortable was a person…
so we just giving every woman a talk show?
Katt Williams has always resided in an epic artistic stratosphere, which is why he has been consistently targeted and attacked. Yet, he is still very relevant and FIRMLY STANDING on his principles and refusing to be a sell out!!! Much love & respect to this comedic legend.🖤
Kat Williams lets the audience see a side of him hidden from the public by his stage persona. I know he had depth. However, I did not know much. Moreover, he didn’t know how long he had been in the game.
Sherrie is fine as hell 💯💪🏽
Baby you look goodt!!!
Did she have a breast reduction?
That’s a great excuse! I thought we were meeting there. We didn’t use phones back then. Plus, since he was embarrassed he didn’t say anything about it.
I luv me sum Kat Williams. Sherrie that's how i feel about attending his shows! I won't buy tixs cus im scared he might not show! smh
He looks refreshed
“You’re a siren”😅
That universe banking system statement is one of the most intelligent things i ever heard
I Love Katt Williams!!
Okayyyy Katt & Sherry 🥰😂😂
dude has style thats why he is loved so much and he is not taking sh from anyone wich brings him sometimes in trouble true man true hero
This is the best I've seen Katt look.  I'm glad he's on the up!
This man is the G.O.A.T!! I love him like cooked food he needs to stop fighting kids in high school and come wife me up lmao!!! 😂
Looking great, Katt.
I miss Wendy
Sherri tryna throw the 📦 at him on TV..she literally tried to force him into a date..on TV! The thirst is real😂 Katt know it and was still a nice guy about it.
YAAASSSS it's sometimes hard to remember that celebrities are people too. Glad he is doing so well now and wish him continued success 💘🙏🏽 this interview helped me see him from a different perspective and definitely has gained more respect from me.

The chemistry between these two 🔥🔥🔥
Sherry was flirting lol! They’d be cute together!
He looks clean and good
Sherri is Definitely a Classy intelligent vibrant woman. Top tier
Kat you look good ❤
i think we were just privileged to witness something here lolol hmmm.....
Did she say a shout out to Bone? The man run over by Shug?
Katt is soooo honest that i think he kept sipping to not say what was on the tip of his tongue lol... He obviously respects her and is happy for her and genuine likes her.  There must be a valid reason why he didnt show up for that date and i dont think he wanted to embarrass her of what the real reason was.  Much respect to both of these powerhouses!!!
I love Katt Williams and his hair is amazing, I’m so glad I found this video this morning ❤
great show🫡 the both of you
I miss him
Whenever i see this man i die laughing  😂😂😂
He look good I'm happy he is in a happy place in his life
Katt is smooth like a kitten 😂
The dame goat

He looks amazing!! 🙏🏾
💛Katt💛
Kat looks so good &sounds so much better ❤ I love it
Katt Williams you're the Man!!☺️
Love the hair

If real talk had a word. KAT
I likes that jacket though
The only time Katt Williams looked taller.
I went to a Katt Williams show in my hometown back in 2006 or 2007. Leslie opened for him and wow look at them both now!❤🎉
love this interview, Katt appears to be doing well!
Love this! It’s giving Wendy Williams show and I’m here for it! There’s plenty of room for another one!
I love you Katt…..
I love him 😍 and I love a man that can make and keep me laughing 😂
You have to really understand kat he has already saod so much but a lot of people just think it's a joke and they laugh but never catch the truth in the joke..also he was not ill sick or strung out on anything but god has given him a true spirit of discernment
Where did her boobs go
Kat Williams has been one of my favorite comedians for a long time.
That part about deposits and withdrawals are TOO on point! Facts Katt!!
Love Kat Williams
Funny how all the PUBLIC women Katt been with all miss him and having nothing but positive things to say. Proof that he’s a good ass man
What’s hilarious is that Katt roasted her ass in one of his standouts lmao! But damn, already almost at a million views. Katt do numbers. He has a Great fan base
Katt got dreads now  lol
They would make a wonderful couple ❤
Katt is loooking goooooooood asf . My mans.
Kat can make you laugh and be telling real truths!
Wonderful episode ❤❤
i will never date a woman who thinks the world is flat 😳. She subject to be persuaded every which’a way😂
It good to see katt williams again  he,s a funny comedian  I wish him the best
You can tell theyre really friends. Only a real friend can accept you for who you really are.
The tension between them 🤣🤣🤣🤣 i love it 💖💖
When Kat called Sherri A "Siren"!!!I just had to go look👀it up😂😂😂This is what it said Seductively,Beautiful,Or Charming Woman,Especially one who"Beguiles" Men!!!A"Siren"of the silver screen.🤔I'm so on the edge of my seat"Smiling"😉It's gotta to be more to it cause the Chemistry between these two the energy is Strong💪🏿😁When she said you can't even look me in my eyes😍Tells it all I'm here for it🔥👏🏿🔥👏🏿🔥🥰
I like Katt williams and he looks so healthy. I love the dreads on him
Not Sherri shootin her shot as soon as it starts
He threw in that little joke at the end. Most people didn't get it. She lol
6:35 - it *is* great to hear, but i think we also have to be _quiet_ about charity... and correct, it aint that serious, but still ---- the point of giving should not be BLASTED on the front page headlines, in my opinion. If you are gonna' do it, do it, and others should not be puttin that charity on blast. Social media just has a way of bastardizing what should be "quiet," or "private," or on the sneak. and AMEN. bloop.
Glad to see you both are doing well😊
He’s a WILLIAMS, you gotta love him 🎉🎉🎉😊
They are so cute interacting with each other. They both look phenomenal too. 😍
To whom much is given much is expected by the most high GOD. ❤, I love Kat Williams he so real.😊
Shout out to Prince.
He looks healthy.
Great content
Kat, looks well.
Katt is hilarious, Prince was not pointing at you. He was pointing at Kim K, Prince specifically said he can't dance with no dudes😂
Omg! This was too cute
Kat is still funny and Sheri is still beautiful! *STILL!*
1 of the best comics ever legend
They def had a past relationship or something...they was flirting all through this Interview
Bring Tyra back… 😍
Take dem nasty 3d printed lime green roach stompers back to Ross… 😂

Love you Katt,  you are my absolute favorite comedian!!!❤❤❤

I am going to this show.  Dark matter
I love that Kat Williams has not fallen into the entertainment "cult".
Sherry desperate...
Katt has always been and will always be my favorite comedian EVER! Huge shoutout to him for sponsoring Ms. Melba Moore's Hollywood Star. Thank you for inviting him to talk, Sherri!💖
Yes! So Damn funny....😂
AGREED!  Depositing kindness whenever and wherever you can is essential!  Love it! thank you Kat and Sherri!  This was a great listen!

👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I think Katt was putting on for all the backlash he has been receiving.... But hey he looks great 😊
Kat Williams looks great..
Love this interview and Happy for Ms. Pretty Ricky. I was blessed to witness her comedy when she was on a show with Guy Torry in Milwaukee. Happy to see she is still on the grind and touring. She is not a female comic that does sex jokes all day. Very funny.
Looking like a mature 2 Chainz out here. Love Katt
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Kat is the absolute best hands down!! Wise man!! Thanks Kat Williams ❤
I loveeee Kat. He's extremely intelligent and funny
Katt looks really good

Katt looks nice.
🎉😂😂😂
I think they should try it  I LIKE IT😊
daaaaamn Sherri looking good
He looks great ❤❤❤❤Go Kat Williams 😊
This was good
Katt realizes you have to pay it forward so your blessings can continue to flow.💯
Okay wait a minute hold up is that an Illuminati post that he has on that flyer? All this opportunity all of a sudden did Katt Williams sign up with the illuminate?
😂😂😂❤❤❤
Okay Katt and Sherri 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🌺🌺🌺🌺✨✨✨✨I’ve always been huge fan of Katt so happy he looks and is doing so well.
6:06 katt shut that down real quick. majority in the comments dont even get it.
Oh she wore her revenge dress TADAY!!😂😂
❤KAT WILLIAMS / most underrated comedic superstar of our time  He is smart AF , but kind . Very rare in comics  so so gifted .
It’s the chemistry for me! OMG I’d love to see it…what a great match🫶🏾💖
Kat Williams, is a TRUE Legend In Deed⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Definitely  a Sherri fan now. Get it Sista. Her vibe is just beautiful. Katt go get her...
Sometimes,  I feel things that I can't quite put into words,  then someone like Katt Williams comes and speak for you.   "The universe has a banking system,  and it's imperative that you put deposits in on a regular basis so that your withdraw is never denied."
Wow. I now see and hear Prince’s fashion, influence, vibe, energy & philosophy upon him💜
Love Kat 💕💕
He is crazy on First Sunday!
OMG 🫠🎬🎤 Wow…
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Katt
Deposits to the universe. So your withdrawal is never denied. Katt Williams
I am loving the season that Katt Williams is in blessings to you brother.
Met Him Years Ago At The Airport....... Class Act!🏆✨👌🏾
She should definitely give Mr Kat a chance to make that date night up. I'm loving their vibe. As much as I love Kat and always in my top 5 comics ever. I've never seen him like this lol
Kat is the goat comedian
Kat looks so healthy! I'm happy for him 💜
Sherri Williams has such a gorgeous smile.
Kat is very guarded, you can tell.
Wow this interview is both sexy and interesting.  Kat was absolutely shy(never saw this side of him before) and Sherri was so giggly.  Hmmm I am intrigued.
Legend ❤️
Am I tripping or does him and Prince sound alike ? “ UNGRATEFUL “ 🤣
He looks really good
I ♥️Katt🙌🏽
That was a very good interview. I've never seen Katt in that manner and learned some things about him. I'm going to look for his tour-I've never seen Katt  live and I love Tommy Davidson.
Katt is a legend🙌🏾🔥❗️ Glad to see him healthy & enjoying the fruits of his labor 🏆 🐐 💯
Kat is a sweetheart
Damn Sherrie is really gorgeous 😍
😂
She so ine
This is so cute😘😘😘
A Great Person.

I love me some Katt. Got a chance to take some pictures with him at The Ruff Ryder’s Beach Fest years ago in AC, NJ. 🙏🏽✌🏽❤️
❤🐈‍⬛

My oldest son and I went to watch you in Tallahassee about 5 or 6 yrs ago. Love your success, growth and humanity.
Sherri so fine
Kat is a very sensitive and deep thinker in what the world delivers and how people respond to what is presented in life. I have grown to see him in a new light, and I have great respect and liking for his creative work and his delivery of it. God bless you Kat, and may you continue to use your talent and your God given gifts to help others and grow spiritually!
Love Katt!!

Nothing is awkward here 😅lol he's a fellow Virgo ♍ this how we are around someone we like alot! He's very shy right here rather anyone knows it or not! He's definitely trying not to show it hes really nervous! Us virgos are all mush believe it or not! 🤣😇✨
Is it just me? As he approached Sherri, I felt some kind of energy between them. Okay, maybe it's just me.😅
Katt Williams is a modern day philosopher, a genius comedian, and an overall good soul. I luv Katt❤
He looked great. So happy to see Katt
When Katt said “it is imperative that you put deposits in on a regular basis so that your withdrawals are never denied”
I love and respect Mr Katt Williams ❤

This was awesome, I really enjoyed watching this interview.
Hey Kat looking good tho. Sherri and Kat would make a very interesting couple 😂😂

LOVE YOU KATT.❤I THINK YOU ARE THE BEST COMIDIAN IN THE USA. GOD BLESS YOU.🙏
Yall stop sleeping on this man's genuine nature. I hope Katt lives to brighten the lives of millions more people!
This is a good show..ima start watchin
He looks very refreshed
Is it me or why he will not make direct eye contact with her.
Hey Sherri make a day of golf with Katt a special episode of Sherri....And post it on your social media......We love the 2 of you together...
The Prince reference is phenomenal. Bravo!!
He's trying to not look down.
He's looking like Zaddy
Nice
KAT is in my top 5 all time best comedians but them lime shoes are not!
He didn't really want to discuss his philanthropy.
Katt is self-funded, he doesn’t have sponsors or loans to finance his shows. He self-promotes and self-sells his shows.
4:00 “Prince showed me you didn’t need anything more than what you already had. Reinvention Always.”
I love him!
Him and Lil Jon kinda favor, I’m loving his hair like this
🔥🔥🔥 Whew! He looks GooooDTTT!!! 🔥
Sherri was really flirting with this man on tv, she didn’t have to open up with that
i was genuinely smiling the entire watching, very proud of them both!!
Dawg, Kat Williams is that dude!
Wow. Thank u Sherri
I thought you was meeting me there 😂😂😂😂
Katt looks nice! Love the hair!! He reminded me of Prince when he walked out!! Wise man!
Nice post
Sherri you fine we need a date together for real.
He mentioned he’s in therapy so he may also be on medication to help him. I’m so glad to see he’s doing better. I laughed harder than I ever have when I saw him live in Cleveland.
Thought it was Burna Boy for a second there😂
He is such a genuine person. Love Katt.
Kat is looking good and healthy.
Sherri looking fine
Katt looking good af! Hey zaddy! 😘
Katt ❤
Katt Williams is an actual Royal by DNA. He is in my bloodline. 🤍
ALWAYS HAVE AND ALWAYS WILL LOVE KATT WILLIAMS!!!!!!
Sure is a lot of cleavage going on. 😮
He’s a good man savannah
I want that jacket he’s wearing 🟢💚
She consistently has had top 5 breast cleavage in Hollywood since Jamie Foxx show 😊
The second hand embarrassment for Sherri. 🤦‍♀️
I love Katt Williams my Virgo ♍️ King we are the best
Boy Sherri getting finner 😅
He looks healthy. This is amazing
Love his hair love him period
Katt done loc'd his hair. Babe is growing and changing.
You didn’t get the car,house,or the golf date (yet) but he did bring you flowers 😊
If he likes her this much, why ain't they together? If a woman could make an adult fidget that much, how else would he know that's the one???
8 minutes into this video I just realized why his hair looks different. I was so engulfed in his energy that I didn't know why he looked different.

He was funny when he was on drugs. Dam shame drugs make you who you are. Sober this guy is not funny at all.
Kat Williams is funny asf and I'm happy he is doing better and in a better place. Congratulations to Kat Williams.
@6:52 - Don’t be misled—you cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant. Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful nature will harvest decay and death from that sinful nature. But those who live to please the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit. So let’s not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don’t give up. Therefore, whenever we have the opportunity, we should do good to everyone—especially to those in the family of faith. - Galatians 6:7-10  @9:23 She knows what she's doin! Got her "f him dress" on for that ghosted date. 😂🤣 Don't do it, Katt (see Proverbs 5-9)!   What does being a siren mean? noun. Classical Mythology. one of several sea nymphs, part woman and part bird, who lure mariners to destruction by their seductive singing. a seductively beautiful or charming woman, especially one who beguiles men: a siren of the silver screen.
These two actually look cute together.
Ngl sherri looking mighty good these days
Katt looks really good. So glad he looks healthy and stable
Sherri is so beautiful.
I love that Sherri gave Katt those well deserved flowers, and the way she shed light on the type of man he is when no one is even looking.  Continued success and blessings to both Katt and Sherri!  💪🏾
Is called storeing treasure in heaven my friend. Jesus Christ spoke about that. Is aka as truth.
Wait a minute 😂😂😂 Katt got dreads now?
Well he ended it by saying she's a siren.... So there you go😉😉
Set me up 🤧😂😂
Sherri  has always been fine. I wish I had tried to holler at her.
Katt...if you were just a little bit taller...🥰🥰 Much respect to him!
Your a siren 🚨 pull over that azz to fat sherri✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
Get it Katt!
So, nobody gonna notice that Sherri never smelled the flowers? Not once! Khatt looks great & I love the vibe he's on. ❤
You guys are the best ❤😊
I'm getting Johnny Deep vibes from Kat very nice
Omg!!! You picked up Tacarra!!!! Yeesssss❤
Ask Jesus to forgive your sin. Turn to Jesus
Katt looks healthy!
KATT is such a Virgo❤
Two of the Greatest ❤❤
She’s a SIREN. What a beautiful compliment. He didn’t want to L👀K in her eyes because he was afraid of her attraction😎👊🏾🤗
I love ❤️ your show
I LOVE THIS GUY..!!!❤❤❤❤
Can you imagine Katt and Prince having a conversation? 😆
Please go on that date ...and video every minute ...PLEASE😂😂😂😂
AWKWARDDDDDDDD
Sherri done came up since she gave her son away. Where is he at?
Katt you are my dream guy.
Let me find out Katt got weave/extensions in his head smh🤔🧐😂
You the boss?thank you Master Williams
He seems so shy and sweet..
Luv me some Katt ❤😂
Katt kinda look like Prince wtf!!
He’s a Virgo. We are givers.
My son’s birthday is on New Year’s & mine is Jan. 3rd so he knows how much I luv Katt Williams so he’s taking me to see Katt Dec. 31st. I’m so fu*king excited..  I told everyone I don’t want to celebrate my bday because I’m turning 5 & 0.  But Katt Williams will make me celebrate! 😂😂
❤❤❤love you sherri
Now, this is a interview on Sherri worth watching.
Katy’s rings are bigger than him😂😂
Katt is the king of comedy right now
Hey look so different in a goo d way
Know what’s so crazy Sheri is that hood chick that made it but never forgot the ones that pushed her
Happy to see Katt in a good space in his life.❤
Kat and Sherri have a special relationship. He is a smart man and a realist.
That’s my guy GO KATT!!!!
Sherri dodged a bullet
I love you, Katy!
Katt Williams looks awesome!!! His skin is beautiful!!! 😍
Two of my favorite, I love both of them, so 😎😎😎
The flower bouquet looked huge when Katt was carrying it, 😅😅
Kat and Sherri look like they are on a date right now. The sweetness and vibe...so cute.
Katt Sparrow
Damn when he said prayer I wasn’t ready for that 😮
Always ❤ been a real one 🙏 even on his bad days Salute 👑 to you both give them their flowers while they are here love it ❤
so here's an interesting observation Wendy Williams crowd was very diverse. Everybody came Sherri's crowd is mostly black it's not entirely black any good 90% ghetto that's worrisome for longevity from a business perspective. And I'm not hating I love you girl I'll love you to death and I want you to be on for another decade but you need to get them Spanish and white folks in there and the Chinese folks in there, and the Korean and Japanese and the Hindus, cause you know you cannot just be having a one type of crowd followers although it worked pretty damn good for Oprah with white folks didn't it
I see he is finally off the crack and Off the cocaine it's about Damn Time old man
That's so sweet ❤
I love this man. So intelligent and well spoken. He's the best.❤
He lost me at "the universe"!
2 of my favorites I Love Sherri since The Jamie Foxx Show ❤
He can play prince in a movie
Best he's ever looked
Katy Williams needs to write a memoir. He was emancipated at 13 and has several adopted kids. I need to know more.
Lovely 🌹 reunited and it feels so good 👍😊👍❤
This was the best one . ❤
I’m a fan but why does he look like a black Willie Nelson 😂 OMG Katt no, just no  that’s red neck appropriation 😂😂😂😂
Very much enjoyed this interview. I was grinning too. Both look sooo good. Sherri looked 🔥 in that dress tho ❤
Where is Wendy Williams
Katt is a Legend ❤we love him
He looks really good ❤
Love him, is he the “Kay” that Teena Marie use to sing about?
Sherri and Katt Williams would make a cute couple
I like this show because Sherri shows the best part of her guests.  Sometimes ages shady, like towards Monique, who got her in check, but I still go to bat for Sherri.  She’s so good when she’s good.  She’s good when she’s bad, because she sincerely apologizes, unlike Wendy.  Sherri will age like fine wine if she keeps this up!
Did they have something in the past? 😆 Kat's face says yes.
Hi Sherri I love the show this segment great I love that you mention Bone I know you probably don’t remember but I met you through him. Please give him and Seattel my love and I’m glad that he’s doing better. She always speaks of you guys friendship all the people he came up with is good to see you guys are still friends and looking after him your successes will be endless and I wish you much much more wonderful job.
Wow I didn’t know Katt Williams was so generous I love that💯
📢  💨 Katt Williams is giving  Prince energy b4 I typed it 😒
🐱
This was an AWESOME interview between Friend's. And that sometimes can blossom into your best relationship ❤🎉 Love you both!
Love me so Katt Williams
Ok Katt Williams! He looks great
LOVE THIS MAN!!
Never like her
Katt you are amazing
This is a weird interview.  Kat seems like he doesn't want to talk and she really has to drag the answers out of him and he's uncomfortable.  Anyways Kat is one of the funniest in the game.
Katt is in the upper tier of comedy
Katt you are the man 👊🏿💪🏿💯
I am so happy for Katy! He has so many great talents. He always keep me laughing, and just to know that he has a given hard. He is truly a blessed man, but I do think Sherri , if it’s meant for you two guys to hookup soon. I can tell how he adores you ❤🎉🙏🏾🥰
Much ❤❤To you both .🎉🎉
He looks so much healthier
He thought she was meeting him there, so he was feeling the same thing she was feeling. Makes sense, lol
Wat happen  was LOL🙂😅😅😅🥰
I know Chemistry when I see it! 😊😊
she got a man?
Love Kat Williams 🙂❤
Katt one of my favorite people of all time.
Lol
He looks great!!!
He is really  a nice man.
Sherri lost weight ❤
Wow nice
I can’t wait until he comes to Fresno California.. I love that maaaan
This was truly wonderful!!! Love Sherri as well. She gave him his flowers while he's here. And this was needed.
WOW!! Sherry, thank you so very much for sharing this show with the public because I never knew Kat Williams as this person I always thought of him as being funny but to see being so honest and professional I 'm  in awe ❤ So beautiful ❤
Ole Kat done went to the other side otherwise he WOULDN'T be on this show.
There seems to be some chemistry between these two 😊
If a man has to pause for that long to a date request you may want to keep it moving
I love Katt he never forget to say thank you. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
He’s matured so much it looks great on him way to go Katt❤️
I love Kat Williams. 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
❤
Amazing!God is good. ❤️❤️❤️Much love and respect to them both.
I love me some Katt Williams!!! So funny! So real!
He is one of my favorite comedians besides Dave Chappelle❤❤❤
I 💕 it when we love on each other ❣️
😂😂😂😂😂  He is so funny!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sherri was moist during that interview 😂😂😂😆😆😆
Sherri’s hair is on point
Katt is a legend. He seems like he's true to himself and he don't sell his self out like you see other people doing in this industry.
He's a sweetheart. His generosity may be a conscious discipline, but it's still generosity.
Sherri looks AMAZING!
Beautiful chemistry.. Sherri did a great job and Kat never disappoint.. a very wholesome dialogue
Sherri is looking really good. Gone girl!!!!
And I love you as well Sherri you are just phenomenal
I love Katt Williams he’s just so humble!💜💜💜💜💜

Kat Williams❤ LOOK AT GOD🎉
Beautiful interview ❤
I love him!
I want Katt Williams and Sherri to be a black love couple ✊🖤🤎👏
Lovely
The last time I heard about Katt and Red Grant in Atlanta they was going at Wanda...
Ms. Shepherd we are waiting for your visit to Jamaica.
Boy…. That woman’s smile, man…. Beautiful lady!
Nice
Katt didn't make a mistake.  If you set up a golf tee time with someone its expected that you're meeting up at the course.  That's common sense.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
You can tell your friendship is genuine. ❤
I love this, they are both great.
I only saw "you saying too much" vibes from Katt
They are too cute!
Katt looks great! Many blessings
Nice to see him like this. Like him not cussing or using n word. Like this version😊
I love when people remember when people helped them in the past. I am a personal trainer and i saw a girl working out hard in the gym and we became friend. She eventually told me that her and her husband were struggling and she comes to gym for stress relief and she couldn't find a job to help because she wasnt well qualified. I suggested to her she should be a trainer and she became a grest one and is extra happy and making great momey. I made the mistake of congratulating her by saying im proud how she ran with my advice. She boldface told me she wanted to be a trainer since she was a kid and no one ever told her anything like that loll. I felt bad but i am still happy for her ool
No matter how much these industry people try to destroy him, he bounces back. Glad to see him out here in this space. This was a cute interview. 😂 The lady that said "no" after she asked about the golf meeting should've got taken out immediately.
❤❤❤❤
Like that ❤❤❤"Make DEPOSITS so Your withdrawals won't be DENIED "❤❤❤
A good guy and funny funny
This is why he will always be blessed because he knows how to bless others. Mr. Katt, continue on your journey to help others. And you will continue to reap good HARVEST.
He looks like he's living a clean life.. good for him
Smart man, legendary, and hilarious 🤎
Katt is a wonderful, wonderful  person who’s not only a Professional Talented Star, he also cares deeply about God, and the people living in this country, love me some Katt Williams💜
Wow!!

Good for Katt, he's looking good and healthy. He's been my favorite comic for almost 20 years.
Is that Katts real hair?
Ain’t never seen cat this fine. He in his masculine energy ain’t it 😊
Katt Williams makes the Sapiosexual in me Purrrrrr. I would love to sit and talk with him for 30 minutes. He’s SO intelligent. Between his intelligence and his humor, he drives me wild. ❤❤❤❤
He stood her up. Hmmm.
My highlight in my life will always be working at Footlocker in South Texas and he came to knock off a unit and J's that I sold him for his show that night. He got me back stage passes to his show. Goodness.. dude smokes the strongest weed i ever got a whiff of 😆  i could barely talk to him backstage due to the smoke being so strong. 😆  Most humble entertainer ive ever met. Blessings to you Katt Always.🙌
Kat looks good!
❤❤❤
Katt needs 2 stay out of the "Laws Eyes 👀" cause he's 2 talented 2 keep getting locked up.
Kat looking 👀 good
I saw that tour in bham alabama it was great

Man he's such a humble dude...❤❤❤❤
I love Katt through his ups and downs. Always authentic and so is Sherri with her cute self.
He seemed spaced out to me ijs
Love Katts new relaxed look. Looks nice on him.
It makes my heart glad to see Katt Williams healthy happy and still doing his comedy.
He looks amazing!! Good for him!
I would love to give the two of you a golf lesson! Angelique On The Links!
I LOVE THEIR CHEMISTRY!! I hope the date happens!!
I love kat, but no respect for sherre   when she tried to abandon her baby she wanted nothing to do with her baby.... Kat please don't date her( she's so fake)
Sherri's wearing heels & is still shorter than Kat?!?
Sherri's wearing heels & is still shorter than Kat?!?
Aww Kat Looks Good And Healthy GOD BLESS HIM🙏🏽🦋
He is talking about the law of reaping and sowing y'all
He should be your co host!! That would be an awesome duo
🤔 what an awkward interview
Katt Williams go ahead and clap Sherry’s Cheeks lol 😮
He is soo down to earth ☺️
I love Katt ❤
How did his hair get so long
Love this guy❤️
I really like his new hair.
He can't look her in the eye cause the girls got their eyes on him!!! Sherri knew what she was doing with that outfit!! 🔥🔥🔥😂 I don't blame her!!! Show him what he's missin!!
Wow Kay looks great
Katt is great 👍 👌 👏 🙌 😀 😄
He's now a rasterman, I thought he wore it as a joke, lol
Im offended he still has a platform after all the racist things he said about Mexicans I don’t see the guy from Seinfield having a comeback.
His show in KC was more then amazing the whole squad BANGERS
Nice 👍
He seems so much calmer now than before and now as defensive. I always thought he was a good comedian but became bitter at some point and very defensive. But I love the new an improved Katt Williams, it appears therapy has worked for him .   I love his analogy of depositing into the world as to a bank...you get back what you put in! ❤❤❤
Sherri is a class act! these are the images of black men & women we NEED to see!
Sherri grinning the whole time❤😅 KATT is on TV trying not to use fowl language.  His show he does a YouTuber had his show
This was such a touching interview. Sherri thank you for giving Katt his flowers!
@SherriShepard @KatWilliams the Chemistry is there. Kat is either seeing someone or scared of Sherri. A man know when he fumbled 1. Great Interview Ms. SHERRI❤😊
God bless you both. Love the comedy and love, continued blessings. 😊
Amen ❤
Love, love, love Mr. Katt Williams wishing him all the blessings!!❤❤❤❤
GD MORNING 🌄 SHERRI BABY 🌺💐🌹 LOOKING LOVELY IN EVERYTHING
I love Katt, I love his comedy, I love his acting in movies, I’m an all around fan! This man is great and creative and smart and hilarious, and he looks terrific! I love this !!
He is really a nice man
They would be a cute couple
Kat is one of the best comedians to ever do it 🙌🏽
Katt is real honest. I love that about him. I wish he and I could sit and just kick it. Bc I wanna know why all ppl can't  be like he and I. I don't talk to all my kids all 5 bc a couple not real, it pisses me off and I can't vuss their A out the way I want to. Bc I'd be stepping on toes I cant mess with bc I'm the parent. But...I LOVE ME SOME KATT WMS. BUT...
Is she the new Oprah?
DAMN, I L❤VE THIS COMEDIC GENIUS! CAN'T GET ENOUGH!
You look good Katt. Locc's look good on you. It takes a magnanimous individual to already be stellar.. but continue to challenge yourself to grow and evolve EVEN MORE. Prince?! Who knew (but it makes sense!) Impressed more only w/your relationship (ACTUAL relationship, not association.. you dig me.. ) w/Iron Mike, crouching 🐅.  Your story is inspirational King. I'm.. not nobody (Wallo got me to stop saying that) but.. someone who's not more than anyone else, how bout that, but you're Elite, jack. 😘🤩 But sincerely may you continue to shine, Mr. Williams.
10:05
Kay! You look amazing 🤩 very humble and glad to hear about this side of you.
If he's on Sherri's show, he's definitely sold out
Yes yes yes this makes me so freaking happy YES KATT aww man this is so cool thank you Sherri for seeing him he is truly a genius of a comedian. Sherri you truly are an incredible human being and great friend:)
katt williams should be in a super hero movie.
Katt Williams for President!!!💞❤️
♥️ This dude
I just wished she had commented him on being a dad. I heard he has five adopted kids he is rearing on his own. I would have loved to hear about that. Heard he is a great dad
Katt is so humble. 🙏🏾❤️
Love this!!! So glad to see my favorite comedian doing his thing.☺️👏🏾
I just love you Katt Williams. Amazing soul❤
❤❤
After all these years I've never made the Katt/Prince connection until now. Their interview presence is so similar
I absolutely love Katt Williams!!!
MY SON'S TOOK ME TO SEE KAT WILLIAMS FOR MOTHER'S DAY AND I REALLY ENJOYED MYSELF. MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS HIM. ❤❤❤
I just  love me some Katt Williams. I'm showing up every time he's in my city. I cry laughing until I can hardly breathe. He cracks me up. God bless you Katt Williams!!
😂
Sherri is a beautiful woman, and Katt, wow, I didn't realize how cute he is. Beautiful show
I can definitely see the Prince influence
THANK YOU KAT  THE LORD FOR ART THOU AYESHIA SAMONE  HOLY HIPHOP
I'm not surprised about his prayer life. He was raised as a believer and says that his parents were very spiritual.
He is so humble
Dark Matter looks dope. And Katt is the type of cat, that doesn’t haven’t to say anything his just hilarious being Black.
SHERRI LOOKS NICE!! And Katt is FUNNY ASF!!!
Peace and Blessings King Katt 🙏🏾
A real one love katt Williams for the truth of it. 😊
I'm so proud of Katt, GOD is really working blessings in his life, we love you.
So nice y'all had me feeling like a teenager with y'all's Chemistry. Kat sexy too. Her Sherri u Siren u❤
When did he stop looking like somebody's   gay crackhead  aunt and start looking like somebody's sober gay uncle..he looks great 💯 less stressed
I'm surprised he agreed to this interview. But it is Sherri, who says no to the Boss?
I love Kat one of the best of the best comedians!!
Love love love Katt Williams!!!
I have always, always loved me some Katt Williams!!  He along with Chris Rock are my two favorite male comedians!!!  He and Sheri most definitely have a vibe going on and I'm blushing right along with Sheri!!!  Peace and blessings to both of them!!!
If people knew just how bad ass this man is in business he earned his previous arrogance, lol.   Kat is looking good luv the locs.
Sherri is such a Beautiful down to earth Woman. Meet her in Harlem some years back, she's so genuine ❤Katt my Favorite Comedian. Katt's a class act and already an Icon❤
Am a pimp named slickback. Say the whole thing.
Patty Jackson brought me here
Awesome ❤
@7:18 Well said Kat Williams - "The Universe has a banking system:  "Hence, It's imperative you make deposits regularly, so that your withdrawal is never denied."
Niiice 🥰always loved Katt Williams 😍
I Absolutely Love Kat Williams One Of The Realist 💯💯💕💕
Katt was really nervous and shy around Sherri. He kept picking up that cup. Lol
This king has a beautiful heart 💜 & that's why he's so short his heart is bigger than his Whole body 😂 it's  just love pure love for you darling ❤🙏🏾❤.
Absolutely One of the best in the Comedy World 🌎 I absolutely love you king for keeping it More Real than Comedy Amen 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾.
This guy is so profound. I love it.
He looks really handsome .....dang real grown grown.....❤❤
This man is in a whole class by himself. I would definitely love to see him in person. I love the character he plays on Boondocks. A Pimp  Name Slickback. 😂 😂
Love love Katt Williams
❤❤❤❤Kat looks good.... his skin  he is in a good places...you can tell...
Not a good transportation schedule? 😊
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂
Kat spitting wisdom
THIS MAN IS SO HANDSOME SHERRIE❤
Awesome man and handsome and sexy… I love his work and ministry 💜🖤😘😍💯
❤❤🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
I love seeing him in this light and I see the chemistry ⚛️ ❤
His locs are better than the perm! Team Natural and Healthy.  I always enjoy him!
He looks good af !!
Oh yeah! There’s a spark between them! She “praise questioned” him and he knew exactly how to answer!❤❤❤
Loved it and just too funny😂😂😂😂
He is so fine
Well done one of the funniest  man  on this earth  mr.kat Williams you go boy 😂
One of my FAVORITE comedians! He looks great!
I’m am a boy Damon😂
Hmmmm,  Something definitely happened between these two back in the day.....i think the chemistry is still there too....................GO FOR IT!!!!!!!!!!
I love Kat! He looks great!!!
This was so awesome! Im such a Kat super fan, i can't even get who isn't 😅he so lovely inside and out...live long and prosper my friend😘
oooooooo I fel that chemistryyyy! So happy to see Katt given platforms to other comedians. Keep up the great work. Blessings coming back 10 fold😍😍🙌🙌
Yesss two of my favorite !!!!!
I thought he was funny years ago, but don't find his comedy specials very funny anymore. I think his fans fit a particular profile just like the fans of Tyler Perry Productions fit a certain profile. I find Tyler Perry's stuff simplistic and poorly written and agree with what the great Spike Lee said about his productions. I would bet the people who find Katt hilarious are the same people who like Tyler Perry's stuff.
Ok then siren 🚨 Sherri🤣😂
Katt looked so uncomfortable 🙂
As a Christian woman in ministry his words is so uplifting especially about the bank deposit he looks very humbling and speaks intelligently never judge anyone God can send anyone to inspire you
No surprise there she's so needy.
0:39  not even a minute in and it’s giving they done hooked up in the past vibes….😂❤
😂😂 He clairvoyant ...he read blocked and protected his energy like a mf❤😂
They go togetha 😂
This would be the party I’d love to be at!! These 2 would be FUN on a weekend night out. Or a Sunday morning in. Whatever lol. Just chilling w them.. hilarious, upbeat positive, intelligent people who would have many amazing stories to tell. If I could be there listening to them and enjoying their company…. That would be a great time!!   Sherri makes me laugh. Like all the time. Stuff that other people can do or say but not be quite the same as Sherri telling it.  And Katt was always one of my first stand-up favorites ever. He got me into watching stand up comedy when I was younger. He’s definitely got one of a kind voice and way of telling a hilarious story - but thats his career and legacy. He’s a comedian. And a damn good one.
What a blessing TODAY IS A GOOD DAY! YOU GO SHERRI! KATT DESERVE TO BE ON! BRING HIM BACK TO HELP YOU HOST YOUR SHOW SOMETIMES. IT'S REALLY GOOD YOU KNOW HIM!! 😮THANKS,❤ LADY ☺️ YOU MADE MY DAY. 🎉
Shecwasnt flirting at all!! He's shy
A newfound respect for this man… “Mmwwaahh!”😘 Mr. Williams— Love you!
Katt a fool!😂
My my ..Katt is the most realist comedian that i love to listen too. I have never been able to make it too his shows in richmond va , been going through a lot with cancer diagnosis twice but i catch him on TV and all i do is laugh so hard my stomach be aching but  but he is so real and I just love him and how he do his comedy shows.  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣You go KATT< the real no#1  Comedian
I love  k.williams
Yessss... bring back comedy.  If you don't have a sense of humor, don't go.
She said it in the beginning of the interview. They have had a history of personal and professional careers. I appreciate what they have and their understanding of it.
How is this man so shy , like what is happening. It is so cute to watch Katt in this situation 😅😅
Amen 🙌🏽! ❤ Making deposits into God's universe always comes back blessed. 🙏🏽💪🏾❤️ Well said sir!!
Can’t believe what I just saw Katt shy.
Two people I love!! ❤
❤❤❤
The best interview ever yes he needs to come back on ur show fr
Katt looks great!
Katt love loves her lol ❤yes Gawd I’m here for it!!!
KATT MY GUYY LOOKIN GOOD
I’m loving this conversation between Katt and Sherri. Awesome presentation. XoXo
Definite chemistry
Those shoes though.... If green is your color Katt has found the color of new grass.
I love the growth. He has been through it and still standing while looking better than ever. Congrats to him.
Omg Kat Williams is hilarious😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
One of my favorite celebrity interviews.
Sherri that man is so creative and talented. He is my best comedian artist ever and the only person I would rank him with all due respect that their methods and approach are not comparable is Chappel. Respect to Katt Williams
Even the people in the front seat must have gotten sparks on them. Those sparks🎉were flying!!!😅 That would be a nice union though.
❤
I love ❤ Katt, however; I seen him in Colorado one year and couldn't hear shit of his show. "Katt, I'm in Jacksonville- Duval  - I want some tickets. "
I've never been to one of his shows but i can honestly tell you tjis brother has been telling the truth throughout his career. These comedian has got to listen him things he say aint no lie all true. He more to himself and humble. I definitely respect this man for all his work he does.
So sweet.  ❤
Katt my favorite comedian ❤
He actually likes her and I'm here for it...he looks super handsome here not a huge fan of katt but here I see the charm and peace he is coming into.. I can completely see him and prince being friends...now that I think about it he has total prince vibes
It was good seeing Kat today on the Sherri show.
Yes they would be cute together..❤❤
I love me some Katt Williams.  Please come to El Paso❤
They have some good chemistry
❤❤ Katt
Sheri Kat doesn't know he has been using the biblical/ spiritual formula of offering and tithing. "Give and it shall be given on you press down shaken over... He doesn't give because, he wants to be blessed. He gives because He's already Blessed and out of the Blessing he gives.
Solid interview!
So great together!❤
He looks so healthy and peaceful!
I love the outfit 😍😍😍😍
Good Morning,Kat Williams great interview,thank you Sherri❤❤❤❤

He is soooo my favorite comedian. I just love him. Hilarious on so many levels. Good to see him in a good space… Sherri Thanks for having him on. It made my morning. Still laughing
Why would he go on a date with Sheri 🥴 Lord hamercy🥴 I still don't understand how people watch her show 🥴 I see the clips on YouTube but we know something is missing from daytime tv.....
Sherri you and Katt looks great. I guess it's God at 4:30am has me watching your show and texting at this time. By all means if Katt still have a generous heart ask him could he past the generosity my way. I had to have 4 major surgeries in the last three years but I am not complaining. Because of God's grace and mercy I am still here. Love you guys ❤🎉❤
Fine Azz  Kat Williams , You Go Boy ! You Still Got It ❤️❤️❤️
I love Mr. Katt Williams.   G.O.A.T❤.   Sherri he called you a siren.  Giiiirl he would be hypnotized 😂😂❤

‘Deposit; Withdrawal’ - That simple.

He amazing don't sleep on him
Yes
Now I can’t unsee how much I love the idea of them together 🥰
Katt is looking fabulous!!❤❤❤
Either Sherri finna eat Katt alive and he nervous or he getting ready to make a run from her😂😂I can’t tell!!
There was so love there especially from Kat. Great to see him again and he is still funny! 😅
I like Kat Williams 🥰
❤ Katt ❤️
Kat you sis doing her thing u only want to see her sore to the highest heights.Don't look in her eyes 😂
The 🐐
Sherri has the best day time show
Yep they smashed ❤ he had to cross his legs a couple of times…😂
He is so so brilliant - that prayer analogy was so good … love Kat Williams
I see Prince in him
They look good together! Lovely blue 💙 dress, Sherri! Wish she was my cool aunt! Love Katt! 😅😊 Katt does give off Prince vibes 😊
"It is imperative that you put deposits in on a regular basis so that your withdrawal is never denied" His wordplay and metaphors are serious.
Katt is a beautiful man❤ God is so good
They done cloned him 😐
This hairstyle looks so good on Katt! 🔥
you look different mean  you shine different Katt  its good
❤Kat
This the best interview ❤
He looks good. He is taking care of himself.
Kat looks great! They look sooo good together. 💜💜💜
4 minutes in and i was like, why isn't he looking her in the eyes?😄
I absolutely love katt Williams
The best comedian ever!
Okay Sherri!
He looks shy
Katt Williams always been my favorite comedian. He is truly a legend in comedy.  He really grown and mature
I like his hair like this.
nice man
Love his jacket
Katt Williams. damn he's fine!! That's my man😜 My favorite comedian.
It was today that I realized Kat is handsome.
🧡
Absolutely 💯 For sure ❤ KS ❤ PRINCE 💜 Forever 😊❤
Kat, a good and humble man.
I have never liked his energy. He comes off very mean spirited usually. This interview has been the one and only exception.
Sometime when your young and you don’t have someone to help guide you thru life you will get off on the wrong path.I knew when I was growing up there was older women to correct the young women to keep them on the right path in life and same for young men alway some mature men in the community that let the young dudes know they couldn’t do that I think something young black kids don’t have today correction from there own peers.
Katt going to get a hole in one😏
He looks good and healthy! Age is looking good on him.
Just kids akready❤ I wish that he opened up more tho
Kat looks good!
The way he said "No sherri.. you know why" when she called him out for not looking her in the eye... SMOOTH KATT, great interview❤❤
Love me some Kat!  Brilliant mind, while loving his God! ❤
My all time favourite guest on Sheri. I love them together ❤
I lobe mans soul😂😂😂
I forgot he still around what did ever happen to him
Kat looks good👍❤
A Real King of Comedy 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🙏🏽
He looks Good!! Damn Kat👀
Sherri still has a thing for Katt 😂
I’m so glad Kat’s in a different headspace. He’s so talented and seeing him constantly getting into trouble hurt to watch.
He's a Virgo and Sherri is a Taurus very compatible. Virgos are financially conscious but Taurus women are about money money money. Kim and Croy's perfect example My husband is a Virgo yasssssssssssssssssa!♑️
I love this interview Katt is a awesome person
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Katt looks so healthy now. Proud of him! 🙏🏾
Katt gave me chills when he spoke about the giving principle he practices.  Powerful and real talk!
Katt is giving me Prince vibes
All I'm going to say is that.....I  love Kat Williams from the beginning to the now.❤❤❤❤❤
People saying that they should date. Oh no, he stood her up lol. He's a confident, flirty, comedian, thats what they do, they charm people. He's just playing yall. Lol
Hey arrived😂😂😂❤❤
Katt and Sherri look so good together and she is shorter than him. They would make a good couple
I wish Shari wouldn’t have talked about Kat’s generosity. Some people want to just be low key about giving to others and not be publicly recognized.
Dang now I have to go watch him roast Wanda i need the laughs to continue
They would make a really cute couple...
I got to see Katt for the first time about 8 or so yrs ago. Had me crying laughing always have liked him. Comic genius!!
Katt wanted to let you down easy, and he didn't want to hurt your feelings. He likes beautiful women and you are far from that. You look a little better now but you still act silly for an older woman. Also you have a big mouth and talk too much.
I see the legend Katt I'm here.. Sherri you been a legend for a long time
Awesome 🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾💖💖👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷👛👛👛👛👛👛👛👛👛👛👛👛🎒🎒🎒🎒🎒🎒🎒🎒🎒🎒🎒🎒
You know… Kay Williams does remind me of Prince… even in his mannerisms and the way he speaks
I like his new hair style. It looks great on him. Never liked the straight perm hair
KATT IS UNDER THA RADAR
Love me some Sherri
He is fine and good looking
I’m so glad that Sherri pointed out that he helps others! Most want to focus on the negative and never the positive! Kudos to Katt! 🙏🏽 I absolutely Love him!!!❤️❤️❤️
You guys are much more comfortable with awkward tension than I am lol 😅
My guy kicked the perm for the locs🫡💪🏽😂
Go for it SHERRI! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Universal Formulas!!!!! Dem Deposits!!!!!✨📿🕊️✨📿💛💛💛💛
Katt looks great!
Thank you for having Katt Williams on your show I have followed his career and yours for a long time I love you both this was a great show thank you again
Kat is the best comedian
Katt looks so handsome and healthy! 💜
Katt looks good. God Bless 🙏🏼
🙏🏾Katt Williams 👏🏾 💪🏾👑😁
I love Katt Williams ❤
I ADORE ME SOME MR WILLIAMS HE'S HILARIOUS. I MISSED HIM THIS PAST SUMMER WHEN HE HAD A COMEDY SHOW IN MY CITY PERHAPS I'LL CATCH HIM SOON ENOUGH. STILL LOOKING GOOD AGING GRACEFULLY TOO.
Hum… Katt, would you pay off these Student loans for me and a small house in River Forest Illinois taxes and all I’d greatly appreciate it and your banking system would too. It could be my charity Christmas gift. Thank in advance. Much Love.
Great folks 👍🏾 👏🏾 😅
I appreciate Katt Williams & I really am  feelin' his HAIR now!  He really looks well.  Shalom all.
Cat is the Richard Pryor of our time!  He is So talented and needs to be highlighted more than Kevin Hart.  Kevin is really not that funny.
Katt, the man
Yea, he's sober now
Why does this interview between these 2 have me grinning like a Chest Cat?!?😁🥰
I love him so much ❤❤❤
Katt!!! My favorite comedian!!!!
5:18   don’t let that go over your head
He looks good!!! Happy for him!
Katt is soo hilarious and cool. 😊
2:30  He's wise enough to protect himself from soopreemazzy's agents. 3:13  Sounds like SOMEbody in the audience KNOWS him *FOR REAL* !  ROFLMBAO 'cause he is NOT on that performative bullsh. I appreciate how he accommodated the circumstances: Quiet as its kept, he is indeed A CLASS ACT. It's amazing how the industry always claims friendship with people you NEVER see them with.... I'm pretty sure he KNOWS who his TRUE friends are at *this* stage of the game. I cognisng that he IS INCOMPARABLY GENEROUS THOUGH --  Believe THAT.  I LOVE HIS SPIRIT and pray it remains protected by TheAncestors from the nation's kollonized agents, pawns, and their enablers.
He is quick witted I swear🤣🤣❤️‍🔥
When Katt goes anywhere, people are watching. This video already has over 130,000 views.
I dont feel like he was being shy. He just was being cautious. Sherri' s one of them now and that interview could've went either way. Yes he was nervous. He looks good though☺️☺️☺️
I love u Kat. I've been to your show twice. He deserves so many more flowers than he's got. He gets more humble with time. Look forward to seeing you again.
He paused before he answered to the golf date. Lol
Kat And Sherri would be a cute couple.
I love this interview ❤
Katt Williams is so handsome
Wow he looks great and so does she ❤
This is by far one of the best interviews on the show ! I'm a huge fan of them both ! Katt looks damn good too so proud of him !!! ❤
Kat💯 A True Legend🙏 Keep doing great things!
Hey my fellow ♍️ Amen. Chris Tucker & Dave Chapelle...💜 Tyler Perry...Taraje P., etc. We move that way!   Seldom in the company of... _____ by choice!
He so fine!
I ❤ Katt!  His fit is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I WANT THESE 2TOGETER THEY BOTH DESERVE ❤
Katt is very underrated and a great humanitarian❣️We love you Mr. Williams may God continually bless you king🙌🏼💪🏽🙃
I really like listening to his interviews. Such an intelligent and well spoken man.
Kat hugged her like a playa….yasss

I love this look on him…… 😍
I see....I ain't saying nuthin but.... Great Job Sherri 💕.
I LOVE IT KAT LOOKS SO GOOD AND SEEMS SO AT PEACE!!
Pause.....I was watching on my phone.  Katt on Sherri Show...I have to cast this to my TV!!!!!!!!!
Kat knows Sherri is like Jamie, they be telling people's business on national tv and he is not about that, until he has beef with you. He called her a siren, the man chooses his words.
Every body seems so happy to see him now maybe I can take his jokyes more seriously ,but lol.
Stay In this place Kat, I love it!
I'm her for it!!. I love him!
I can tell the moment he walked out there that Sheri is a love of Katt, he really loves her.Thats beautiful to have someone like that as a friend.With all that he dies on stage , off stage he is very shy.
My ninja forever a fan ❤
I love this man. He is so funny.
Got damn Sherri, you fine
Sherri you look so phenomenal. Kat Williams is a classic.🤗
Kat looks so much better. I hope he's doing great.

Did they use to date? He did seem uncomfortable being with her?
Katt understands!
Ok Katt!! He looks good!
I love it. Kat Williams I wish him nothing but the best.
Love Sherri, Love Kat, and I Love that y'all gave Prince his flowers, keep up the good work. Awesome Show 💜
Katt also adopted kids.  I heard that a long time ago and nobody's mentioned it in awhile but he definitely knows "the formula" 💯
MEEOOOW!!  Katt looks good ❤
Sherri had her puppies out and EVERYTHING 😍I felt the flirtation in the room
Katt given Sherri the flowers more like an apology for standing her up.
I’m a such a Katt fan! He is one of the funniest to me!

I have never seen Katt honored on any talk show this way! I'm happy for him and he looks great!! He's one of the best comics ever!!  Especially when it's void of vulgarities 😅 LOL !
My absolute favorite comedian of all times…Katt Williams!!!

Katt I love you ❤
He’s looking good these days.
😍😍
Katt looking like Johnny Depp from Pirates from the Caribbean.
Get it Sherri!!! You got Katt all up in his shy mode!  He can't look Sherri in the eye because he knows he fumbled that opportunity to get with her! I love seeing this side of him, so sweet! Great chemistry! 💛💛💛💛
katt looks good, man! whatever he's doing, i need him to keep doin it. he's still funny to. always liked katt.
Katt is great he's a self made man just lhim and God
I LOVE ME SOME KATT🥰🥰🥰😍🤩🤩😘
Flirty ❤
Did Katt hit that or almost hit it...hummmmm😊 inquiring minds want to know
He's short she is short I think it might work🤔
7:08 greatly said!!! 💙💙💙💙
Love Kat and Sherri ❤
There you have it. Sherri is a siren... " a seductively beautiful woman".
Love You, Kat Looking Good ❤
Love him so humble
The way Sherri was smiling, I could definitely tell she was picking up what Kat was layin down!!  Love it!!!
"On Stage" Katt is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from "Real Life" Katt. He has this enormous confidence on stage, but in interviews he ALWAYS seem very uncomfortable. It's always hard to watch him in interviews. He makes the interviewer work SO hard.
He was a little shy to me. A little nervous...I think he was definitely feeling Sherri. Still don't know what a siren mean?
Ok Sherri and Kat I see the lil love connection y'all got a lil 🔥🔥between u2.... we see it
Girl he must really like you 🤭 he called you a siren. Men only say that to women that they seem to lose self-control around.
I think that he has evolved. He is the truth!
How special is this!  Katt looks really good!  My son's  father chauffeured him years ago and took a picture with him too in DC & MD. He's humble!
Kat should play Prince in the biopic. He looks like him!
Katt may God continue to Bless you 😂❤❤❤
Dam if thirsty  had a name 😢
She got them suckers  Purked out for Katt!!
I love the Locs on Katt❤
Katt looks Great
Katt Williams is incredibly underrated. Regardless of what he has been through he has always been quietly generous. A real one.
❤❤❤kat
This is so cute. He likes Sherri.
Yes they flirting lol
Kat Williams is definitely a shy person considering the kind of comedian he is and the stage presence he brings during his performances. He is a legend
He’s Right. It’s the Law of Giving and Receiving. The more you give the more you receive.
I love Katt. He's my favorite next to Dave Chappelle.
I love Katt Williams he's a different kind of comedian ❤
Kat look sexy. I can c sherry and him❤
Katt looking good I love his hair
❤
Now im curious why he hasnt looked her in the eyes!!
Therapy is working!
BROOOOooOOOOOO I CANT STOPPPP LAUGHING ITS NOT EVEN 2 mINS IN ... .OMGGGG THESE TWO TOGETHER.
I enjoy that ❤❤
Not that you care, but this look is better than the perm Kat👍🏾
Y’all gone head and get together.. y not 👏
I think y’all would make a cute couple. I didn’t know Katy was so intelligent. I love him more today than I already did ❤
Thank Katt. I told my son JT what Prince told you.
Aw Sherri likes him😊He likes her too😊
Katt looks good
Good answer
Katt looks great,ok I see u,u're 1 of my  fav comedian
He looks healthy and appears to be in a better place! Good for him!
yup, great interview and they both looked good. i like Katt
Hang in there now!!! You can do it. 👍
He has been my boyfriend since the first time I saw him on Comicview that aired on Friday nights back in the early 90s. My husband will say "Yo boyfriend on TV" when Friday After Next comes on. Has he ever spoken on why he can get away with telling on Hollywood/Black Hollywood but Monique gets blasted for doing it? Maybe he does, too, but just in a quieter undercover way. Do tell. I love his honesty.
Katt is a funny dude and one of the best in the game!❤
Daddy ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Sherri and Kat are so cute!! They should go out!
And comes with gifts.. he looks great!
That energy was so strong....I'm blushing at home.😂
Katt & Sherri is another power couple waiting to happen….
I had the pleasure to see Katt live. Very nice ❤
That Universal Banking System Works!!! Make your deposits ❤
Katt is such a charming, well-spoken man. He chooses his words carefully and means what he says.❤❤
I love Katt Williams!
Love it!!!! I am loving this Sherry Shepherd...and she knew what she was doing when she wore that blue dress🤣🤣🤣...is beautiful...And Katt couldn't quit fidgeting🤷🏽‍♀️😂😂
Go for it katt Williams, yes! Looking healthy love me some katt lol! I wish he would do some more movies, but Hollywood can't take katt lol😂
The funniest man everrrrrrr🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
❤❤❤
❤I love Katt!!!
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Transformation
Katt Williams We Love You!! ❤
❤
I love Katt Williams he look so good 😘
The king of underground comedy!!!!!! Katt Williams
God bless you Kat Williams. Waiting for new movies from you😂
Sherri you’re such a boss for having him on the shelf. I don’t think he’s been on many or if any daytime TV shows… So I’m really happy for this opportunity for him. Shout out to the Virgo nation because Kat Williams is definitely a Virgo.
Katt Williams is a GOAT in comedy  People sleep on him but he's very intelligent ❤😅😊
Spiritual wisdom @ 7:15 ❤ I love this! Kat is a wise man. 🙏🏽
At this point in his career Katt doesn't have to sit and be interviewed by anyone, yet he came to Sherri's show. Last time he was outside was for the season 20 premiere of Wild N Out. Basically what I'm saying is he's only going to be around people who are real like him, and I am the same way. Keep your circle small...
Ms. Sherri brought the new girls out today 💃👀
Kat looks amazing and healthy ...talent unmatched glad to see him doing well no one is perfect but if u stay consistent there is nothing God can't bring you through ❤❤❤well done Katt
HE IS SO FINE WITH HIS SHORT SEXY SELF  ..DAMN. IM WAY TOO TALL FOR HIM THOUGH!❤
I really enjoyed the interview with Kat Williams and you can tell that you guys have history❤
❤❤
I love Katy!!! ❤😂
I got the impression that he did NOT want to be interviewed. Hard to watch. However, kudos to him for supporting his friend's talk show.
Katt has changed a lot. I honored to have witnessed his transmutation.
Katt Williams is looking good 😊
I love Katt!!!! Couldn’t click faster when I scrolled and saw this!!! ❤ They would make a cute couple 😍 I love how kind and generous he is and how he keeps it private. Lonnie Love spoke of this too! ❤ I also love how he often acknowledges Prince’s influence and greatness. I’ve always thought that when Kat lowers his voice when speaking he sometimes sound like Prince ☺️ (Btw, remember how excited Sherri was meeting Prince on The View? 😁).  I also love how witty, intellectual, spiritual, and philosophical he is. And he is real. If he likes you and thinks highly of you and says so, he means it (kudos Sherri ☺️).
❤❤❤❤❤ It’s always great to see Katt Williams.
Love me some him❤ God bless you Katt 🌺
Love ❤️ this man…He’s da bomb 💣
Katt Williams is still the baddest comedian in the game.  ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
I think they could handle each other
The chemistry is so strong, it had me blushing!
Kat touched on how he use to be insecure about his height... Sherri is shorter than he is... Sounds like a good match to me 🤷🏾‍♂️💯
Kat is looking so much better these days. Why won't he look in her eyes - lol🤔
Sirens can read your soul… pull you in… release you into a different world and leave you wondering about wtf just happened…
He look so Handsome ❤
I love how Katt takes his time in responding... i need to start loving that about my man. Let the man think to respond Quita! 😂 && the chemistry on stage... Getcha man Sherri
Katt is looking good
That head hair shot ❤
Katt looks really good like this, and the hairstyle looks nice on him too
Love the chemistry between them ❤❤❤sooo funny 😊
I absolutely love me some Katt Williams ❤❤🫶🏽
Perfect Gentleman. ❤
Katt is my dude.  Always keeps it real.  But I wasn't getting flirty vibes 🤷🏾‍♀️
Sherri you working that dress girl!!!
My absolute fave...Katt all day. I'm, rooting for him
My man Kat ❤ Ain't nobody better than Kat Williams 🙌🏾
I enjoyed this interview so much I had to watch twice! Katt been the goat and so happy to see him healthy and in a good place!
I went to see him a few weeks ago I had a blast ❤ He wore his steeler gear an all rep Pittsburgh real hard
I think people missed the part when he said to Sherri that she is in her rightful home…meaning she wasn’t comedian material but she’s a good host on tv…I got your number Katt 😂.
As we speak Katt Williams is the best male Comedian in America 🔥🌹🔥🌹🔥🌹
Sherri, Katt, is there something you want to say to us?? Hunh?! 😜🥰😊🤩💕❤️
Katt looks really good and he’s handsome. Wish him nothing but the best. ❤
He didn't stood you up Sherri, he couldn't find his balls.
🤴🏽👸🏽 .... The Holy Spirit Looks so well on you both❤️❤️ God 🤴🏽⚔️ Bless and keep you both and always in my prayers! 🙏🏽🙏🏽 💯✌🏽
It was beautiful❤...the luvvv that did not connect!(Sherri Kat loves non verbals😅😅😅 you are toooo much woman...too verbal😅😅😅😅
I love Katt Williams 🙌🏽🥰
I would like for Kevin Heart and Katt W to do. Collab plzz

Flirting at its best,between 2 best between 2 of the best😅❤❤❤❤💐💐💐💐💐💐💐
Nah. I thought I was watching oral surgery cuz she seemed to be pulling teeth.
This interview tickled me so much cause I have never seen Katt so nervous, did y’all catch that Siren joke? I don’t even know what that means?! 😂😂😂
Very nice interview, love, the chemistry, the laughs and most definitely the love
Wow Kat is tall 😂❤
He's a comedy wizard, we love him. He's had a crush on her forever, she's a siren alright.
My favorite comedian ❤
😂😂😂😂

He’s a wise man and Sherri you are the truth 💯👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 May God always bless you both love y’all 😍🙏🏾
Kat Williams looks really good. Sherry was making him nervous with her questions🤣
He had NO words and speechless to the GOLF question of why he stood her up Lmfaoooo 😅🤣🤣🤣🤣
Katt looks goooood
I Really want to meet Katt Williams
There will a part 2 to this story and I am here for it!!  There was a distinct mutual attraction!!  😊
This was kinda weird interview.Something wasnt right. Stay tuned.I absolutely love Katt but something was off
🤎🤎
He acts nervousl
Kat looks good 👍🏾
Katt looks extremely Sexy in his new look!!!!
It’s always funny when you see a comedian do an interview and they’re so calm and reserved…and they aren’t trying to be funny. But everything they say or do is funny because you know their comedy. Katt as a performer is so different from how he is in an interview. Eddie Murphy is the same way…it’s almost like Eddie goes out of his way to be serious in interviews. 😂
Love it 😂❤
Kat we love you
This why Sherri is loved and respected.  Thank you for showing Kat in a positive light, and only a positive light. And I'm so glad to see you both thriving.
Top 10 all time, Katt
Yall make a cute couple 🥰⭐
The GOAT !!! 🔥🔥🔥
They flirting 😂😂😂❤
That my boy😊
Love Katt 🧡
I love Katt Williams
Ungrateful sherri😂😂😂😂❤
Praise goodness he got off that crack! Best decision ever
Katt is deep. He's  educational, and unique. ❤❤❤
He looks healthy,happy and grounded.
There was so much left unsaid here ... And I thank them for being mature adults and leaving a little something something to the imagination ... Whether for play or for real 😉
This man made me laugh so hard even in my most difficult times 😂😂😂
I'm so happy just to see him doing so well. 😊
He want some Sherri!! when men get shy like that, its an attraction...
Shouts out Katt Williams!
Kat fine frfr and knows how to treat a lady ❤❤❤
Amen ❤
I love Kat, but that was a rough interview...def not his comfort zone.  Sherri did a good job keeping that conversation going.
Sherri is usually desperate for a man. Surprised, she wasn't all over Katt and his advances.
We all love Katt❤❤❤❤
💜💕
It was the keyhole .. he couldn’t look at her
There's unfinished business between Katt and Sherri He can hardly look at her She's exposin her breasts n this dress The flowers an apology but also a front Mixed messages galore
Kat you are looking well. Philly Love
The interview I didn't know I needed🥹🥹🥹
Sherri looks great, seems like a great spirit!
Always, been a fan of Kat!!❤❤❤
Sheri be telling the business through silence 😂
Katt really looks good !!!
Katt looks better than EVER! @rhondaroberts7275 is right...its clear he's in a great place in his life! ❤
Love it❤
Ooohhh! Sherri Sherri now!
I love Katt! Look at those beautiful flowers 💐. I can’t wait to see him on tour again.
Yes, Kat looks GREAT!  He’s one of my favorite comedians. Love him❤️
Is it me or is Katt looking a little scrumptious here….
Katt Williams.  ❤❤❤❤
Always loved Kat, had a big crush on him. He's so funny and real😊
MY GOODNESS:  THIS WAS EXCEPTIONAL!
Wow....he is really an AMAZING PERSON ❤️

Thnx for inviting katt on the big interview stage...

He is so adorable & shy
Wow! I’ve never seen Kat at a loss for words he likes Sherry he could not look her in her eyes 😊 Whew !!! He got the hots for her 😂 and she knows it. I ain’t never seen him swirm 😂😂
I luv that man...😙
Is she shooting her shot?
The man is a genius. Nothing else needs to be said. 😊😮😂
Did it seem that he was nervous? He picked up that cup several times. Being a quick-witted comedian you wouldn't think he was shy. Congratulations to Sherri on her show and to Katt on his tour.
Wow great interview...you definitely cant keep a REAL one down. Looking great Kat! Bring Dark Matters to Chicago please👍🏽😊
PTL Sherri, Kat…I respect you both so sincerely; I previously had a wrong impression of Kat, through media.  Sherri, thank you for allowing us to see him differently; bless you both💯💌!
Katt has alopecia?  Lawd help unc
I need to see him live before he retires.
Oh my goodness I'm in love with him. I have been to six of his comedy shows. I would love to meet him in person. I have a huge crush on him!
Who said , "No!?

I was so pleasantly surprised to see Lil Mo, Mark Curry and Tommy Davidson at the Comedy show in Portland, OR I paid for Katt and got some extra treats!
Katt does look a little like Prince. I can see him doing a  biopic one day.
Katt the truth !!

Glad to finally see Katt back in person again. Sherri was able to pull him out
Katt Williams is looking GOOD 😍😘
Just a quick recap on a woman can't teach a boy to be a man No more than a man can teach a girl to be a woman I believe that's what secular and worldly thoughts are about.   Not everybody has the money to pay for a man nanny or even a nanny raising a daughter and two boys A single parent My first son was a challenge from birth because of being very premature but there was nothing I knew about God back then that I didn't learn through the years because as he went into kindergarten I wrote a poem called deer World when he got into older elementary and then junior high and high school The only role model he had was me his mother I was tough I was rough I did all the sporting things the camping anything he liked I did saying that to say this once he wasn't fifth grade I started reading the Bible and going to church I believe as I told him I'll talk frankly to you there's only two reasons you'll get an erection One you get a hormone that's called horny or two You have to urinate I was determined to show the world that a woman single working hard put herself through college can and does have success and not just in the sense of finances but in the home I taught him and my daughter they were my first two and I talked the last one they're 10 years apart that you will learn to cook because one day you might want to live alone My daughter will learn to take the trash out cuz one day she may want to live alone but that were a team So to make the story the story short he got through junior high he wanted to wrestle he wrestled He got into high school his goal was to go to the military He graduated at 17 and he joined the Marines He's never been back home again he's now 47 years old he made a career out of out of the military but unfortunately he took a year off then went back to the military of the army He was over in the Dominican Republic and he was flown home maybe 3 months later due to an injury that got him an honorable discharge He made his home in Utah with his family bought his house I think that beat the odds of what we say and more mothers need to know that if you don't have a father figure if you don't have a role model you can't keep bringing a man home We all aren't comedians actresses actors to nature itself yes That is what we're taught not all of a sudden parents not all of us had grandparents not all of us had aunt's uncles and cousins cuz I was one of them for whatever reason our parents brought us to California from New York We didn't have a single soul here.  We beat the odds I beat the odds and then I learned about God and reading the Bible and told him you will read the Bible whether she like it or not you and your sister will have to open the Bible read it for 20 minutes like you were doing homework We will discuss what you read close it and when you're old enough to leave the house you don't like what the rules were Then you move on I took workshops I went to the only convention that they held at the Anaheim convention center in California that was a workshop for men They were surprised they weren't going to let me in and I said if this is of God why wouldn't you let me in I'm raising a boy I need to understand what it is your perspective as a Christian man would be for my son Well home below they let me in I had to sit in the back there was over 400 men there They didn't even talk anything about sex hormones nothing so I'm glad that I took it upon myself that said two kids divorced the world says you can't raise a boy Let me show the world what can be done I told my son and junior high were either going to make it or break it son You got to work with me not against me so it's your choice when I say curfew is curfew come home 2 minutes before not 2 minutes after My daughter two minutes before not 2 minutes after the rules are the same I don't care your boy she's a girl the rules are the same I work too hard to give you a good school district to give you a roof over your head never telling you we didn't have money I just had to tell you we had to put it in the budget I never paid them and allowance I never paid them for good grades as I told them when they become adults they won't be paying me for doing a good job.  I hope someone reads this and is motivated by it If not then I'm sorry that you feel that this story is not true but if you ever want to contact me I'm on social media Facebook and feel free my page is open to the public there's nothing hidden in there It has phone numbers I have hotline this is no joke this is for real and it does work.  My second son was very blessed and had and has a wonderful father He is the youngest of my three but he passed away always in our memory He was 29 but his whole family passed away So you can read that on my page as well We just celebrated 8 years and I chose to celebrate his earthly life.  Blessings to you all and blessings to you Sherry I have followed you from the day I first saw you in a movie and I don't mean followed you like I walk behind you or followed you because there was small social media back then cuz there wasn't.  Keep up the good work I'm blessed that you're blessed that you were able to give your son not kind of a life and I just love when you post this picture I think that's fantastic.
I love this look on Katt❤❤❤
My favorite comedian! He deserves those flowers.
He is a good man🎉
Congrats! On the 19th season and Vegas credits!!!
He looks great! Glad to see him .
It's official: They have a past or chemistry!!!
Katt Williams is a National Treasure...so talented! I'm here for Sherri Williams #2...lol Thank you for seeing about Melba Moore another National Treasure...reach back Hollywood...the road of success hasn't been good for a lot of people.
He looks so much younger  and more handsome without the perm.
Katt Williams is my favorite comedian
Katt is very intellectual and is looking GRRRREAT (In my Tony The Tiger Voice)💕💞
It's funny that right before Sherri mentioned his connection to Prince, I was just thinking that something about Katt's demeanor reminded me of Prince.
Katt and Sherri got some history and some chemistry…. Go for it y’all.
I love me some Katt Williams! One of the best comedians ever!!❤
How did he meet Prince at 12?
The One And Only Mr. Katt Williams I love him and he looks fantastic ❤❤❤
That chemistry tho !!!!!!! He said you know why I can't look you in the eyes and then called her a Siren !!!! That was too grown !!!!!😅
Indeed, from what I've learned concerning the information that I've retained over the years from the testimonial experience from comedians: comedians do be stealing other comedians jokes 🤷.
I love his hair!!!
Okay, Chemistry!
Kat Williams look good
He's amazing. The best
Damn it Katt! Why you have to open up in Vegas on a holiday weekend! Phuck! I want to see you but I have too work! Now you have to come back!!!!!
Katt is a down to earth person and my favorite comedian.  He makes me laugh.
He's definitely in a different place. It makes him attractive.
❤️Love this interview with kat Williams .
Luv Kat and his real attitude. Thanks Sherri for giving him his flowers
Is Kat a lil shy?
Sooooooo, after all this time we finally find out the Comedian you always talk about that stood you up 🤷🤦🙂
I enjoyed this interview so Much. The ABSOLUTE cutest moment happened at 9:27min mark!!!😍😍 So adorable!! (It seems they have a true friendship). I Just  Love It. ❤
Give us the scoop ❤
Kat Williams interview was so weird. Maybe the golf thing caught him off guard. He wasn't funny. Maybe it was too early for him.
I'm a Fan of Katt Williams. He looks well. But I must say I have never seen him speechless before😂 I seen the Chemistry Between you 2😊. He owes you a Night Out Dinner Music and Flowers 💐 . Sherri I'm so Glad you controlled yourself very Classy. What a😊😊 delightful interview 2 see you 2 in the same room together How Cute❤ ✌
Ok Sherri what's up with you and Katt Williams you can't get that by me. Looks like he likes you. Girlfriend check that out. Unless you already have?🥰😘😘😘😘😘
Sherri looks so pretty.  Katt is so funny🎭
Meeting me there😆😆😆

Sherry trying to hook up with kat lol
This about to be some shiiiii 😂😂😂😂
How Sweet of you Mr. Williams!  Lookin good you two! 🤣
Sherri looks great!  I love that dress 👗 and her peek-a-boob cleavage.
Gone and take her on that date Katt stop playin 😂
He said by the time I got there I was there 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why he not looking in her eyes, her boobs are smaller. 🤣🤣🤣
Wow!!! Katt Williams on your show... That's is a big deal... The man is soooooooooo funnnnnny.... Great talent....
I absolutely love Katt Williams.
Sherri...Katt was nervous around you....and gave you flowers...expect that P/C for another date..😍🥰
"Put deposits in the universe on regular basics, so that your withdrawals are never denied"....DEEP
Idk when Kat Williams and Sherri will announce publicly they are together?!!!! We, the Two Funny Mamas faithful viewers, have already figured it out. 😊
I ❤️ Katt Williams.
Wow he learnt some amazing lessons from Prince
Sherri I think you and Katt look really good together! Y'all need to have that date!
❤️❤️🙏🏾🙏🏾👋🏽👋🏽love the Prince Stories
That was the sweetest interview because you can tell he likes her. He couldn’t look at her. They would be cute.
Y’all so cute 🥰… KATT you better take her to golf ⛳️
Sheri don’t have good connection with men you can tell cause Kat Williams is the real deal she don’t know he 💯per cent all males and not about no game it may or may not be Kat Williams but I prey that Sheri finds a good man one day that will give her the love she deserves I really love them both good look Sheri calm down Sheri just let the man come to you!!!!!!!!!
i love Katt!!
He just person who makes you want to smile… with all of your teeth showing! 😄
HE LOOKS GOOD 🙏🏽
Kat ❤ what a vibe to see him on daytime tv. Never seen him on “good behavior” lol
Wish I could have heard the convo between them off stage. You know why, Sherri? I can't look you in the eye. Prince didn't only just teach him confidence in the business but with women too, I see.👀 Katt, one of those men no matter how long it was, yall last saw each other, when he calls you clear the calendar.😁 When Katt call you, he be like, "I'll meet you there, no explanations needed just a simple Yes will suffice."😂
He’s acting….sober 😂
❤❤❤❤❤
Katt my favorite comedian!!
Katt looks great.
Yes Prince. ❤
Sherri looks great
One of my top 5 Katt Williams❤
Luv me some Katt Williams

I love Katt Williams!
Katt Williams is phenomenal! Love him, awesome show Sherri!🙌🏽🙌🏽🥳
Love Katt Williams 🙌🏾🥰
Sheri wasn’t making easy for him at all it was very obvious it was something there but Sheri go have to learn he’s a very quiet and private man he could teach her a lot cause I don’t think he likes his women outgoing he did give her a beautiful bouquet of flowers that’s saying alot  cause when a man gives you flowers it’s from the heart!!!!!!!!!😊
Katt Williams ❤ Wow I didn't know he sponsored Melba Moor's Star😳
from the thumbnail I thought that was Shawty
Darn he looks good.
I had to come to the comment section to confirm what I was seeing, LOL.
He looks handsome.

KATT DOESNT DO INTERVIEWS..FOR THE MOST PART.. and people always want him to do a interview.. The respect he has for Sherri and also the respect he has for Luenell is clear. He loves and supports both of these women and they love him back as well.
Kat will tell you in a minute he does not have a perm I love me some kat Williams thank you Sherri for bring him on
Katt is looking 👀 like Zaddy😊
They would be a cute couple. There’s something between them. He looks well.

It’s a hater in the audience - Cause somebody said no😮
I was going to say, why Katt not looking at Sherri in her eyes. I thought it was just me who notice. Katt looks fineeee the more he age. Why he seems so shy in this interview.
he actually looks very good and healthy! happy for him!
I clicked immediately after I saw the screen shot 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's it me or was something popping off between the two.  Very weird like.... like they got a lil something, something,   going  on but don't wanna jinx it.  Idk😮😮😮😮😮
I'm in love. He's so great
he seems nervous. keeps looking down
Never seen this Kat William before. Mostly for him but true.
Hunny you KNOW he blew Sherri’s back out!! You can see it in her eyes and hear it in her voice!! 😂😂😂 go ahead Sherri!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Is it me or is he looking at you a certain way? And brought a gorgeous bouquet?? Hmmmm…
Katt Williams....great interview..and he is stingy with them...
Dang!!  I wish I was there for that show!!!  Love Katt Williams
❤❤❤❤
Sherri you know why? 🫣
He is really a nice man. I knew him when he was a squeaky clean comic, and he saw me at a breakfast place ..paid for my meal. Very quiet man 🤟
