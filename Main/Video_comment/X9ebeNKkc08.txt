Honestly this was better than the actual trailer
One of my favs
Is it in hindi
My name is Adam. "The Adam Project." How epic is that?
So wish I had Netflix 😅
Great trailer
Oh great, let’s all just watch Percy, Deadpool, Hulk, and Gamora all be in one movie
Its basically a mash up between startreck and star trooper. also anybod watched the movie. I have btw
Bro I have to write why I dny like this movie trailer it's so hard because it's pretty mid
Love this movie so much, for me it was very inspirational and relatable. And it was very fun to watch and very emotional. Especially at the end of the movie.

It doesn't matter what condition he is in, it's important that he is next to you as a great gift from God. May your parents always be there for you❤️ -Talgar

THE TRAILER
After watching this movie I cried so much and felt everything I wish I could go back in time and see my dad and talk to him …
nciee!
Крутой фильм ! Очень понравился !
God knows
I need something to believe in and I believe in this trailer
Great movie 🍿
IT'S SUCH A GREAT MOVIE 🎥🍿
This movie is giving cern vibes
Excellent movie. It was a modern day better version of Zathura. You cannot spoil the movie. Excellent writers and an emotional attachment with the audience 12/10 stars.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
It's so hassom
What a masterpiece 😍👌
Привет из России. Я за мир.☮️
Super film ! ❤😊
Few minutes ago saw a preview, got super stoked, watched another preview, it had Mark ruffalo in it, I will NEVER watch it now.
This movie is so good
This movie was amazing
Good movie. Watched it tonight
Damn, the sequel of 13 going to 30 looks wild
Such a misleading trailer! Action! Sci-Fi! Time travel! What you really get is tiring moralistic dialogue scenes in a studio setting. I watched it with my 12-year-old son and we were both disappointed af!
deadpool marries gamora, and deadpool becomes the hulk's son, gamora becomes the hulk's son-in-law, and the hulk is electra's husband...there is a maverick topgun aura...wow that's cool🤭

This is fun. I definitely had a good time even if some intellectuals will say it sucks. I must admit that I'm a bit tired of Ryan Reynold, but on this one he is not as extra as usual - well, at least, sometimes - and he even gives a good performance.  This film won't change the world, but the humour landed more than I was expecting and the familiar dynamic/drama worked pretty well for me. Yeah, the villains are unidimensional and the background story is kind of generic, but this delivers what it promises, being an inoffensive fun film, reminding a lot of what we had in the past decades.  PS: Great soundtrack!
The kid is the splitting-image of the guy on THE GOOD DOCTOR. the resemblance is obvious 😂
This Movie is not good.
Sorry but this is how I feel, Zoe is Jada done right. She is so FINE! YEAH, I SAID IT. Good movie too. I like the chemistry between Reynolds and Saldana. Did they take a page from the Guardians of the Galaxy? Will Reynolds be the new Starlord?
Ryan Reynold you're not fit with kids and teenagers movies .  We need you back ..  We hate seeing you falling from fame .
they boy played 13 going on 30
Well done C.I.A 👍 🇮🇱
i already watched this last night!!it was a good movie but sad too when they all were playing baseball and two adams were gone:((without there dad
This movie was so corny smh I’m tired of these lame movies these good actors are playing in these days 😒💅🏽😂
Sory ı don’t like very exaggerated
Wow hahahah i downloaded before but i never watch  it. Now i wana  watch  it hahaha
This is one of my favourite multi-doctor stories.
WALKER IS PLAYING PERCY JACKSON YAY 🥳🥳✨
Who came here after finding out Walker Scobell was cast as Percy Jackson? 😁
It's Percy Jackson y'all owemji 🥺
I Love That Lady Who's Staring At Adam At The 1:55 Scene
1:54 Lady In Silver Satin Blouse
This kid will be our Percy Jackson in the Disney plus show!!!
1992 "Forever Young" with Mel Gibson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Elijah Wood. Same plot.
if anyone is looking for a comment, i hated it
kids in movies make me very uncomfortable these days
don't confuse the term "science-fiction"  with science time isn't even a thing it is a measurement lol like feet and inches hahahaha and it certainly is not a dimension!!!! bawahhahaha haha there are only 3 dimensions W H D
at least the Fantasy community are honest about their stuff being fantasy
so many green screens, split-screen-acting, and cgi in movies
Groomers.
She no joke said his future is Ryan
Boring movie
crapy film. unfortunately.
If anyone is looking for this comment, this was one of the best movies I've seen in a long while !
Still trying to figure out if time travel exists, or if human cloning exists. It's gotta be one of the two, cause they are indeed the same person!
💓💓💓
Wanna be Guardians of the Galaxy.
I think the movie is every bit as awesome as the trailer makes it out to be.  I absolutely love it.
This movie was sooooo amazing, it justifies the Netflix price increase.  So many hidden gems in this film and it hits every category of emotion. Back in the day, we would call this an "Owner". I just can't say enough good things about it.
Pulling your heart strings whilst preparing you for the METAVERSE.
Good movie
Looks like Back To The Future and 13 Going On 30 had a baby and I like it!
So bad...same lines from Reynolds same humour..so typical so boring and the scenario wasn't something new...just another movie...I m tired watch Reynolds does the same humour in every movie...I think is just the guy for this movies ok but for me it's getting a little bit boring!
Awesome 🤩 Movie 🎥
Stinkbugs are out of my control. Sleep tight hollywood.
It was entertaining at first but then somewhere it got anticlimactic!
ECSTASY
this was so good 10/10
loved this movie, it was hilarious at some points and deeply emotional others. The perfect combo!
Cool
just watched it 10/10
Support Ukraine
Zathura meets Starwars & Guardian of the Galaxy?
The movie for me is so so. Nothing new and very predictable. They need to hire non Hollywood script writer. Honestly they can do better. However Jennifer & Mark meet up gave me the awe ❤️ moment. What I love the most from this movie is THE HOUSE. It's by the forest, warm & cozy. Truly Canadian dream house!
pretty good movie
Story reminds us zatura.we had seen lot of time travel theories, Ancient period it is general art to monk with out machinery it is  spiritual skill deep mystic like the last arbinder's past incident regression.Mojin mechanism of chinese ,maya vasthu,samarangana sutradara ,adarvana veda .as above so below.time is deep mystic this movie reminds us the future.if there is drop of time there must be ocean like time but control is mystic like sky .
the movie is sooo good
He's like version of Ryan Reynolds kid little Adam and big  Adam
Adam is son of Hulk..?
Anyone know the name of the music in the Trailer please?
Really an awesome movie I have ever watched, specially that moment when two different time person Adam was playing with his Dad makes me emotional, super screen play..
Watching right now. 😁
Should have given it a limited cinema release. Great fun movie
Love this movie 🍿🎥❤️
Old Adam is papa and young Adam is a son
I really enjoyed this movie!! Fun, Interesting and not too intense!
This was a well made movie, good special effects and so on. But then Hollywood had to go and do it, as expected. They love their profanity which doesn't shock me that much anymore UNTIL they cross over the line. They take the name of a man who was crucified on behalf of us all and use it as profanity. After I heard the name Jesus Christ used three separate times I said screw you makers of this movie and the actor who apparently did not object to using his name that way. Oh but they will surely celebrate Christmas when the time comes around.
This movie was fuckin awesome! I really hope to see more movies like this
What a great movie, this should be in theaters
I just saw 👀 this movie and contrary to what the critics are saying, I thought it was really good 👍.  I 'm not a Deadpool movie fan, but I thought this was a good Ryan Reynolds movie.
why is this giving me stranger things vibes 😭
Just one word AWWWWESOMEEE.👍
What a actor Adam is and cast is good . ryan reynolds does good movies.
Time travel, Jennifer Garner, and Mark Ruffalo? This is the '13 Going on 30' sequel we've been waiting for!!!!
Finally! The sequel to "13 Going on 30"
Ending explanation: at the last scene with the 2 adam disappearing you can tell that every other timeline has disappeared except for the father one, his son adam at that moment continued his life from 8yo to live all what we know happened before like hugging his mom and meeting his wife at college.
Bruce Banner and Elektra are Wade Wilson's parents. ;)
Director: So Ryan, your in this movie so your basically going to be playing yourself. Walker: So what am I playing? Director: Your going to be playing Ryan. Ryan and Walker : 0_o  o_0
What I love about this movie is that the kid doesn’t have plot armor fight with skilled adults
How is it in this world of crappy science  fiction and weakness, Ryan Reynolds puts out a gem like this. Damn good story, damn good special effects, and the kid makes the whole movie.
masterpiece .so far the best 2022  film
Outstanding show!  👍
Walker Scobel was the highlight for me! I literally had to playback every scene where Ryan and Walker was, cos they were both hilarious together. I loved every bit of this movie.  This is the best movie I have seen in a long while. I didn't want the movie to end🥺
Some GREAT two hours of science fiction in these troublesome times. Thanks. 👍
Really annoying, when I turn down the volume, I do not hear what they are saying, and when I turn up the volume, the whole house is shaking from the dumb background music.. otherwise movie okay
Really don't get the negative comments about this movie. I loved it. The "new and improved sophisticated audience" has trouble enjoying a movie without overanalyzing it.
This... was a really good movie!!! Awesome job! Really touching and heartfelt performances and movie and everything else. Would love a sequel if that were possible.
What happened to Jennifer Garner, too much IR BS for me?!
In the end, there was a "Hawkeye" moment... it's when the father turns around to do something then turns back to his family... his family disappeared.
This was awful don't watch it.
Reminds me of 1992 "Forever Young" with Mel Gibson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Elijah Wood. During a cryogenics test, a pilot frozen in 1939 awakes in 1992 but time is running out, as his body starts to age rapidly. Sweet movie.
I just watched this movie in it was so good
I felt to sleep 💤 while watching this movie. 😴
The movie idea is very interesting. It would work very well, for the moment we live in. If no one from the future comes back to avoid a third world war: atomic. It's because we don't have a future to live. Or by the point that the third world war would happen so that humanity manages to overcome the catastrophic moment in history, and only a few million humans are left alive, living a moment that only after all this happens and living in misery does he discover that union was lacking between the man. Sorry translated English.
Young Adam has two dads
I think they are bonding
The father Adam and the son Adam
I think the Adam twins are like father, like son
Best movie I've seen in a very long time
What a combination... Deadpool - Adam  Hulk -   Adam's papa Gamora - Adam's wife  Elektra - Adam's mama  All teaming up to save and defend the universe🤗🤗
This movie was awesome!
La science-fiction existe déjà, depuis des millions d'années...
everybody dies
The trailer doesn't do justice to how awesome this kid was
I’m a big fan of most things time travel related but if this is too kiddish or comedic this is gonna be a total wash
He should stick to his Mint Mobile Biz. Trash actor overrated.
I loved it
Best movie i've watched this year. I would totally recommend it to anyone looking for something fun to watch.
Idk what are the rules, but he's a terrible time traveler.
Great cast low budget.
Just watched this and its probably my favorite movie I've watched since  pre covid times. I wish I could have seen it in the movies. 100% would have bought expensive tickets and popcorn. Awsome job, Netflix
Is no one ever gonna mention how this is like the movie, "Click" version 2.0????? The Father and son relationship?? The time travel??? And coincidentally, Click was starred by "Adam" Sandler?????
Good movie
RIP White couples
It was good
Wanted to love it, but anti-Asian theme killed it for me. Hollywood is ordered to create anti-Asian characters to criminalize Asian in the US! Disgusting...shame on you Hollywood!
This little boy never acted on screen before and nailed every scene even portrayed a little Ryan Reynolds to perfection. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏❤️
Another stupid movie made for children
Walker Scobell, who plays the "Young Adam" stole the show.  Seriously, he MUST have watched EVERYTHING that Ryan Reynolds has done to match his co-star's mannerisms.
The Only Negative is That This Deserves to Be Watched on The Big Screen Great Flick. Enjoy
"Mankind has no business tampering with the mechanics of the universe. There are forces greater than science."
Super cool!!!!
Best movie I've seen in a while.
Saw this today, very funny, very intimate and great all round family film.
This movie was absolutely amazing!
Well i wasnt planning on crying today. Wow!
🔥🔥🔥
Just finished watching I had tears on the ending part when they play soft ball
Largest particle accelerator is in Europe not USA and is a mile round not this dinky 100 foot one. Also hard drives are magnetic, they get pulled in and destroyed, why not here.
Loved this movie
Just finished watching this and… literally. Best movie EVER. Very recommended, it is rly funny and sad at the same time. 100% should watch this
Great movie. 👏👏👏
The kid was so damn annoying
In our minds.   We talk to our younger selves very harshly. We swear. We threaten. We don't pull punches. But at some point. We say things to ourselves that we wish that we had learned when we were young and stupid.  This movie fulfills that wish. As well as a rocking time travel / make peace with your past / conquer the bad guys adventure.
Mark Ruffalo is a horrible person in real life.
It was better than I  Had hoped . Good job guys!
Thanks Netflix for this great movie. My family enjoy watching it and me too. 100% recommended.
I really enjoyed this movie!!! It lacked nothing.
I like Ryan Reynolds, but he plays himself in every movie!
The movie is so bad.
The best film in Netflix for the FIRST time at all….Rayan 😂😂😂😂😂love u for dis more
Awesome movie ... Just watched it ❤️
Oh my God I just watched this movie and I am still freaking crying 😭
Just saw the movie and i feel that it's not bad, very different for a time travel movie but full of shitty plot holes... Made no sense at the end....
One of the most overrated and worst movies I have ever seen.
10/10 😊😊😊💕💕💕
too much scifi shittt
Finally , released on YTS ❤️
13 going 50
looks like a very goood sci-fi movie, looking forward to watching it!     One thing though, why do sci-fi movies usually assume that the near future will be insanely advanced in terms of technology? If you recall the movie "I, Robot", it fictionally claims that there will be highly intelligent A.I's who are capable of having human emotions, which ultimately leads to revolution. This happens in year 2035, which is 13 years in the future from now. I know these movies are Science-Fiction, but I wish their predictions on the future technological advances were a bit more plausible, more realistic.
Hulk Gamora Deadpool  😲😲😲
Hulk Smaaaasshhhhhhh!!! 😁
Amazing ending
It’s was amazing
It's giving me Zathura mixed with Guardians of the Galaxy.
Jenna and Mark!!!!!
Woow!!!times like this..I wish my higher self can come and take me away to the Cosmos... somewhere peaceful in the Universe....
Can't wait to see this ❣️
Avenger version of Terminator😆😆😆😆
this gave me chills
I fell in love with Mark Ruffalo in 13 to 30. Then I found out what a Woke piece of shit he is. Then I found out that he's my 3rd cousin or something like that from Kenosha Wisconsin. Life is weird.
It's called Adam because of Dark?
This looks so goooood
Look at it with end time eyes, GOD/JESUS 👑 The righteous KING, the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, the Commander in Chief of the Heavenly Armies; the GOD of War 🗡️ is coming to rapture his Saints away 🕊️ & the only way to explain millions if not billions of christians vanishing off the face of this earth is UFOs 👽. Don't fall for the lies, they're fallen angels. I understand only few will see the bigger picture but it's okay, you'll catch up soon enough😉
Boy : mamma hamare picche koi bhi nhi hai ! Mamma : picche mat dekhna uppar dekhna. Boy : 🥶🥶😱😱😱
This is the new episode of What if? where Deadpool, Gamora and the Hulk mmet :)
Can’t wait for it
This looks cool.
The same story line always -- It's a mix n mash of the series Dark, Terminator,  Back to the Future,  Avengers, Spiderman . At the end of the day it's always about the same multiverse, parallel timeline, time travel and  a hero trying to save the world.
One of the Only ads i did not skipped and not regretted
Put Benedict Cumberbatch in that cast and we have a full roster of Secret Defenders!!!
The only thing I can probably say about this movie is that they should have used a wig or some kind of hair spray for Walker or Ryan in the film so that their hair would be atleast similar. Unless there is a reason why both Adam(s) have different hair color, I see that as a slight opportunity to make the movie a bit better.
I could do without Mark Ruffalo...not a fan.  Other than that, it looks interesting.
I hope it's as good as the Green Lantern movie!
0:05 the logo kinda looks like itsfunneh's yandere high school logo
I really like Ryan Reynolds but I don't know if I can support anything Mark Ruffalo is in anymore considering he supports pedophiles
Super 😘
Hulk, Elektra, Gamora and Deadpool! 😱
I already knew about this movie several months ago, but now that I am seeing with my own eyes the official teaser of The Adam Project, I have to say that it will be one of the most anticipated Netflix movies of 2022. And if it is from the director and producer of Free Guy, it's going to be wonderful and it looks like Ryan Reynolds is going to do it again with his impeccable performance. Also, the premise and narrative are very original and creative, the stunt and action sequences are impressive, as well as the visual effects. I hope that film does not disappoint me, and leave me speechless.
🏃🏃🏃🦮🏃📱🏃🦮😂🐘🐘🐘🙏🙏🙏
The fact is his future actually did come sooner than he thought.
Ryan Reynolds in a sci-fi? count me in
Красиво
Deadpool and Hulk together
Good bros
Lets go! March 11!
Everyone- We need another action/ sci-fi movie with a great cast asap! Netflix- “say no more fam” 😎
Boston im Soundtrack ist schon mal geil ;)
Are interracial relationships a prerequisite for Hollywood movies now?
After seeing this i was like I want the subscription of Netflix 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
.
I was expecting daddy from ryan renolds
This could either be Netflix's saving grace, or the last nail in it's coffin.  To make this work they have to put their budget into writing. every element of the movie has to have a significant impact on the story. Stay away from throw away one liners and DO NOT waste your budget on too much special effects. While admittedly a good choice, god knows how much you've already spent on the rights to boston music.
Ryan Reynolds himself has already make this film super cool. But it is much cooler than that when.. "Hulk" & "Gamora" make an appearance. Yeah!
the boy is living in 2022 but he doesn't know what g's are.
¡¿Es Jenna Rink y por eso su hijo también puede viajar en el tiempo?!
JENNYFERRRRR E MARKKKK TOGETHERRRRRRRRR OMGGGG
Count me in... Big time!!!
Mr Ryan with awesome work🙇🏻‍♂️
Good news, I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word (Jesus) and believes him who sent me (God) has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life. John 5:24 Please think about it, believe&repent of sin today! Heaven awaits, dont be left behind.
Hollywood ❤❤❤from 🇮🇳
What I’m most excited about , is that this is coming out on my birthday 🤪😲❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️ 3/11 ❣️❣️❣️❣️

Suddenly I'm no longer 45. I feel 12 again and there's a film I really want to see. Only now I have a son to watch it with. So much has changed, I'm glad someone still knows how to do this stuff.
demi apa seru bgt....
this film it looks like Reminds me to Zathura movie & it's about your Young version meet your Adult version.
For those who loved “E.T.” tell me you did not reminisce for a moment after that spaceship crashed!🤭🤫👀
I can't wait!!!!!
Lan was here
Is Ian boggs Gonna Be Here?
Amazing actors ✅ Great plot ✅ Cinematography ✅  I'm ready to watch/
Meet the Robinsons live action
Teaser really? 🤣
I am a little sissy girl tg
Free guy was great but this might be right there with it
Yeah netflix making all the movies with technology but cant solve the app problems we are all experience righ now...for android app users cant connect the netflix and getting same messages with error code 1009...
It says that @Ian Boggs was invited in tgis movie
Must watch. Ryan Reynolds and Green chick from Guardians of the Galaxies. Sign me up! Haha But seriously love both of those actors. Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner not so much... lol
We are waiting for this movie, awesome Netflix
I disliked RR for years because he ripped off JASON LEE's style. but then he grew on me & J Lee got weird with Scientology and the story with him & what he did to his wife was sick! I only know this story cause Jason Lee is a Legend in the skate world.. Watch The Blind VideoDays from when i was a teenager for a taste of what the skate world got from Jay Lee & his bestBro The Gonz!
I am just here because of Ian boggs
Interracial copule? CRINGE
Dr. Strange REALLY did a number on the Multiverse for Deadpool, Hulk, Gamora and Elektra!
wheres ian boggs
Dammnnnnnnnnn🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ill have to wait for march for this interesting movie 🎬
Love to see this on plex
Ryan Reynolds as a witty actor seems typical and a bit repetitive but damn it, it works for him. Instantly found him lovable due to the witty banter, so “ if it ain’t broken, don’t fix it”
Hope you are having a fantastic day!   A reaction to this awesome trailer is on my channel for anyone who wants to check it out. Shameless plug inserted hahah
This is in our theater, sold out
Looks good! Another shit ton of money for Ryan Reynolds!👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Me who cam here to find Ian Boggs in it
Только хотел написать где же негры и вот она появилась

Lightsaber?

Mark + Ryan ♥️♥️♥️♥️🤟
Congratulations for 23M Subscriber 🎉🎉🎉

Awsomness indeed wow👏👏👏👏👏👏
Will we have to pay for it??
Sick
How they address the grandfather paradox will make of break this.
Zatura moderno
Looks nice 👍🏻
Ian boggs *I have come for you*
If you remove the kid from the movie, would be a better movie. Just saying the truth. Going to pass on watching.
This looks like someone figured out what would be guaranteed  to make money and ran the cost of production by Ryan Reynolds, and the project was a go, go, go!
trash
Shut up and take my money!
Please dub this in Hindi
Yeah...no. I wanna see this bad boy in a movie theater...not on Netflix. This movie would make $100 Million, in its first week, in theaters. Then, you can put it on Netflix.
It was like the movie from the post credit scene of guardians of galaxy 2...
God those looks awesome
Ryan Reynolds called Mark Ruffalo "Dad"... I'm in!!
looks kinda shitty though.
so is this 13 going on 30 extended universe?
🔥⚡🙏👍
*Okay, that looks good.*
story. I’m watching this film for sure
Hulk, Gamora, and Deadpool all in one movie.
This looks so good, I can't wait for it!!
I want to see this
you do know that youtube supports many aspect ratio videos, right? so what's up with the letter boxing in every video?
That’s awesome
That kid is seriously channeling his inner Ryan Reynolds well like holy shit
I can't wait!!!!!
Is nobody gonna talk about how Ean bogss is in this!?!… no…. Nobody… ok
Ahhhhhhh!!! So exciting!!!!
Why you always waste money for kid movies or series? I mean those special effects
This starwars now but on earth
Look nice wow
Holy shit.   When it is releasing.. In hindi.
They really be reusing the same background music for almost every sci-fi movie.
that looks great!!
1:36
I wish trailers were 30 seconds max. Too much is given away!
All i see is Hulk, Gamora and the one and only DoublePenetrator
It's been ages since I had a birthday present, you're very generous, Netflix x)
This is lowkey giving Zathura but not really
Deadpool, Gamora, Hulk and Jennifer Garner  💪
Every time i see ryan reynolds i know the illuminati is up to something. He is like a poster boy.
looks better than most marvel movies tbh.
Ryan??? I'm in... Totally waiting
Perfect 👌👌👌
引擎推進器很強
did the video editors make the kid’s eyes bigger??? it doesn’t look real lol
🛸
Looks good!
I watch this trailer and remember zathura moviee. Who's feel the same?
Why on the earth I watched a trailer of a releasing-in-March movie????? And it looks good too!!
that s remind me i watched the disney movie named flight of the navigator with my dad when i was the age always fancy on myself in the future come back to visit me.
Finaly Deadpool in the MCU. Didn’t see a Deadpool x Gamora film coming
Great trailer, and I picked up the phone to call my dad after watching it!
The beginning felt like Iron Giant
Awesome investment by Netflix. Can't wait to watch. Ryan Reynolds is seriously amazing and delivers every time. Marvel hero's here we come - superb cast.
So The Hulk nailed Elektra and they are Deadpool's parents?
🤣 Судя по трейлеру, хуйня получилась редкостная.
This trailer really give me zathura vibe
Is it lightsabers and blasters ? 2:19
Whoaaaa😄
THIS IS REMINDING ME OF ZATHURA EVEN THE BACKGROUND MUSIC
Damn the BG soundtrack ❤️
Now we know Hulk is Deadpool,s dad.
Yes. Yes. Yes, I'm going to watch this.
When it's a place where you live, what do you have trees, nature also PC's able to run space simulators, imaginary futuristic tech closing doors on your departure and opening it when you come back.
I thought it was star wars for a moment
Thank you Netflix
Can't wait, looks like one of my new favorite
Ben Affleck Daredevil is missing
Uou
Waiting 🔥
The screams at the end.
What if, this was the part of the dark...... 😂😂 Wow that would have been more amazing... So excited 🥺
Hulk meets the FreeGuy... and a light saber?... i'm in
Haven’t seen Jennifer Garner on screen in a while
That is 13 going on 30 I NEEDED
Avangers... Or Marvel, Assemble!!! 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Krish copy xD jaadu
Such a promising trailer and what a casting. Can't wait.
Seems like a Sunday kinda movie
We finally know now that Hulk is Deadpool's dad
It's Hulk, Elektra, Gamora and the Hal Jordan Green Lantern all together in one movie!
March 11? okay that's marked on my calendar now
Deadpool, Gamora, Hulk and Elektra teaming up for their new secret team.

"I know. You think I would be better at it already." 😏🤣🤣 I like this Adam
Thanks to MCU, i can name most of the characters
This is how Deadpool gets into the MCU
It looks and feels like movie Zathura. Because in this film he following his future bro instead his future bro helping him.
Remind anyone of Zathura??
Why we do have more of this movies or series?? Amazing!!! I can't wait to see
1 guy = HAVIER RAVEZ. 2 hot asian girls = MARLIN PIE KYOHEDI LEDR & CEROBLAST. 1 hot white girl = DEB. Sitting in the tree :P HAHAH! OOPS HAVIER RAVEZ strive indeed :P
VERY NICE ND INTERESTED....
Анигиляторная пушка!!!)))
Guess Hollywood ran out of other actors , now they only directly Ryan in all movies xD
I want a X-Project instead
Oh yeah Ryan Reynolds this going to be awesome definitely going to watch this one putting it on my movie night list
I  gonna watch this.
This reminds me of Flight of the Navigator.
Niiice, kinda getting Flight of the Navigator vibes off this 😄
Rendlesham Forest much?
Looks terrible
all my favorite actors. Im so there
Would be awesome 👌
Did netflix trade in Adam Sandler’s soul for Ryan Reynolds?
looks amazing
You're not supposed to post a TEASER a month before the movie comes out lmao
Koi mil gaya Ultra pro max.
finally something that isn't a reboot
Does it available in Hindi also?
2:17 man ryan really likes his lightsabers lately
Please be awesome.
I hate when trailers say "from the director, star and producers of [movie name]" Directors and producers have names
Deadpool and The Hulk Variant
'You're me !'- felt nostalgic about Zathura🌠🚀🛸
looks like sci-fi/action with medium story
Blasphemy
A Marvel Reunion like no other! The Hulk, Deadpool and Gamora!
Wow! Can't wait!
If you wanted me to watch it all you needed to say was "Zoe Saldana"
Boooooring
เสียงกิ๊บ กริน ได้ยินมาแต่ไกล
The sloppy seconds of the MCU.
Excitement overload 😲...
Its going to be super amazing❤🔥😃
Why does this feel like a movie that should be in theaters? I felt like I was watching so long-awaited beginning film of a trilogy. Kind of like the feeling I use to get when watching trailers for Hunger Games films or Maze Runner. Makes it anxious for more.
Waiting...............
Another shitty sci-fi/action/comedy crappy biggest superb movie of the year made by USA/Netflix. It really gets boring... :(
So there gonna be a hulk joke this time?
its got Ryan Reynolds "just take my money" how can you go wrong with that!
nice
Yes nice to see Mark and Jennifer back together I’m sure they’re good friends and good people 😊
Good joke at the end of the trailer, but a young boy who likes playing VR sim/arcade flight games should never ask about G! :P
1:36 I really like this part.. unique 😄😄
Tamil
Puff. La veo muy floja... Ojalá me equivoque pero creo que no me va a gustar
This looks....Terrible.
Ryan Reynolds in Free Guy: I got to use Capt. America's shield...once!  Ryan Reynolds in The Adam Project: I finally get to use a dual wield lightsaber!!  (Yeah we get it, references)
Hulk as Father - Gamora as mother - Deadpool as Son... Interesting... !!! 🤣
A movie where Zoe Saldana is not an alien! Unbelievable!!
Concept looks amazing
Deadpool, The Hulk, Gamora, Elektra.
Gonna be awesome
3-minute "teaser" lol))
Awesome! Looking forward to this epic movie! Ryan Reynolds is the best ❤️
Marvel actors I see 👀 lol
Star Wars x Stargate 1, but leave the mom behind? 🤷🏻
Does anybody need this movie? Think I`ll pass on this one.
i didn’t know the hulk was in this movie
Happy to see Deadpool and Hulk together 🥺
This looks absolutely shit with a ton of cliché scenes even in the trailer
That Was Awesome
Holy Shi7
Oh 🙄look🙄 it's🙄 the🙄 government 🙄putting 🙄out information in plain sight again 🙄
This looks pretty amazing! Hope it comes out on Bluray, I don't plan to buy into Netflix because I simply don't have most of the technology required to enjoy that luxury. I'd buy it without watching it though at the store.
doctor strange 2 looks great.
This seems like it would have been better suited to a big movie screen, but I'm not complaining.
if Ryan Reynolds is in , im in
gg
Time travel exists! sums it up for me💙
Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Gardner, what in the 13 Going on 30 is happening
This 13 going on 30 sequel is intense.
Wait wait wait deadpool‘s father is hulk what tha hell
AWESOME.
so deadpool couldn't wait and finally decided to screw things over
The title sounds like a prequel to Neon Genesis Evangelion
Whatever the movie is, if Ryan is there...then it would be awesome 🔥
Trash
Isnt this zathura?
- [ ] Time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of future sins if you repent of them once you commit them, so you receive the gift of forgiveness by following him. When you start you have to stop sinning, and follow his word and obey it. That’s following Jesus. Read your Bible!!!
The whole thing was a dream. The kid got hit at school so hard he fell into a coma. Spoiler alert.   Should I have put, “spoiler alert” first?
The concept looks amazing.
It's a TRAILER. Teaser trailers aren't 3 minutes long. Get your shit straight, you're supposed to be professionals.
So Hulk, Deadpool and Gamora are all together
March 11th…. I have a lot of things to enjoy during March, I don’t particularly remember them but I have a lot of expectations
Its Ryan Reynolds being Ryan Reynolds. This movie is going to be amazing.
Remember when people complained Netflix didn't have many theatrical movies? Well, now they're effing making ones themselves.
*kid tries to faint* Deadpool: Where are you going??
omg netflix  next lv
Deadpool, Elektra, The Hulk, and Gamora.  Hollywood running out of actors now?
Don't get me wrong... I love rayn Reynolds deadpool vibe acting... And I can't get it enough... But, I want to see more from him... Other than deadpool type acting... I think this movie is a start towards that...
Holy Frickin SH💩T!! This looks AWESOME!!!😆
I see ryan reynolds i click
Zatarra with more story
This industry is going nuts...
I love Ryan Reynolds a lot what a actor he is in my opinion he is the best Canadian 🇨🇦 actor now he is so funny a great at it
It's like a dream movie for children lol
If Ryan Reynolds was a church, i would be at every mass!
Oh my goodness this movie preview takes me back to when I was a kid. I'm excited to see something like this again!!!
Another boy's club movie where the team thought "well I guess we need more representation than just three white male heroes to appease the pc police, so how about we cast a black female side character to tick all the boxes?"
Hulk X Deadpool : The Nexus Event of Madness.
ManI can't wait to see the jokes Deadpool is gonna make in the MCU after this movie
Ryan Reynolds plays himself in every movie that he's in.
Headcanon: Hal Jordan Solo Movie. No ring, not an unlikeable douche, no goofy cgi clothes. Oh and somehow also Deadpool hanging out with Bruce and calling him dad all the time. I'll make it work.
Shame it's on pedoflix, looks like it might be good.
its hulk gamorra and deadpool
crap
Can’t wait for this ,it looks like one hella a movie and great actors ,thank you Netflix.
Wow
I always thought you were not supposed to touch yourself from the past if you went back in time. Something about the universe exploding or something
The person who plays the kid who punches young Adam at the beginning is one of my friends
Booster Gold?
I’m already looking forward for the Gin cameo
looks like a better action movie than stupid ass red notice
Deadpool, Gamora, Hulk & Elektra …. pass the popcorn 😎
Cancel Rufalo
Looks like dogshit
Looks Cool.
Thank you for revealing the whole movie in 3 mins. :(
Woah just woah😍😍😍😍
Another movie where the father isn't in the movie 🤦🏿‍♂️
Reynolds  rocks!
Finally, Ryan in a different form.
Anyone else think Ryan Reynolds was his dad at first? .... Aaaaand anyone think it's still his dad... even though it's him? Think about it 😬
mark ruffalo COMMIE PEEG
i'm sure ill end  up watching it but ryan has been in so many movies that im now having a hard time disassociating him from the other movies and its bringing me out of the experience.
ну для всех же да, гамора халк и дед пул
Nowadays Rayan Renollds is rocking
This actually looks really good
Nice. Hulk and Deadpool in one movie.
Never been Ryan Reynolds biggest fan personally...same in everything and always found him to be pretty overrated as an actor.
This Shit pure 🔥 I'm not hearin what no negative person gotta say 💯😤
Interstellar : "It was me, Murph...I was your Ghost!"
Jennifer Garner walking in with her big red trench coat. Looking like the ultimate Karen ready to complain about why the school isn’t doing enough to protect her child from situations that are out of anyones control.
‌ ‌
Lol Ryan Reynolds’s pumping out movies like there’s no tomorrow.
That's Multiverse . Hulk and Deadpool
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Looks cool but just wish there was no Ryan Reynolds,  not big fan of his work
Zathura ...
Yeah, I'll watch this. Bit worried that Zoe Saldana is going to be a "strong, independent whammen" *yawn, boooooring* wokeness. Hopefully, it'll be turned down lots.
Is Ryan Reynolds in a Speed type of situation where if he stops acting in a movie for more than 2 weeks his heart explodes?
Only white people can make horrible movie after horrible movie and still find millions of dollars to make another horrible movie SMH
13 going 30 cast with a child. How time flies
Epic  bgm. Goosebumps. Don't need to talk about the fun we are gonna get watching this.
Ready for download for telegram 😎
I want to watch this in cinema.
Please please.... Be good!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Dark but no so good and for children.
Wait!!!! What are Deadpool and Hulk doing together???
GAMORA! IS THAT YOU?
Dark
Zatura returns 😂😂😂
Its just like Zathura a space adventure
We all want to see this casting in a different movie!!! (MCU)
thisssssss goingg tooooo sooo cooolllll my favorti actorrrr
Omg Electra and deadpool
"What's a jesus"? More liberal, Hollywood pushing their anti savior propaganda.
Is this series come into Hindi?
Awesome just awesome 👌.  Amazing pice of work
YESSSSSS! Looks great!
This certainly looks more promising than his last Netflix movie.
Jennifer and Mark reminds me of 13 going to 30..
How is the kid version blonde and not the adult version
What the thuck... 😮
Ah yes, time travel impossibilities   Should be fun
The movie should be called: Finding Daddy
looks.....disappointing.....
shit show
1 Corinthians 13:4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
What's next, the Eve Project!?   Just more brainwashing propaganda.
YES.
Why does everything in a hollywood movie now have to be blue?
That looked almost wholesome so how is Netflix going to screw it up?
Don’t think the kid quite fits as a young Ryan Reynolds
I thought it was flight of the navigator
That's look so cool!!!
Finally Deadpool, Gamora and the Hulk got a team up! Just not the way we expected
thought hey this looks ok.. then mark ruffalo, sorry but he can go snort spines off a saguaro cactus
This looks like fun.
Me: *SEES RYAN REYNOLDS IN THUMBNAIL* Also me: *CLICKS ON THE VIDEO INSTANTLY*!!!
The beginning of ww3.
Another movie with dady issues, yaaay :(
Looks like a fun easy going movie with a plot, that’s rare, will watch.
Awesome....Elektra, Deadpool, Hulk and Gamora in one movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just need in hindi 😢
wow
here to see nerd comments
This is why Netflix is the leader in streaming. Even when the majority of Netflix subscribers learned of the service’s latest price increase the idea of cancelling didn’t even cross their mind. People can’t live without it, almost like electricity or water.
Looks boring...
(o.0) assjjfjkjkk4r[wcla.vvlkfo;vdvejlsxksx
I wonder what watch they are using?? 🤔🤔🤔 Is it Casio CA53?
Looks cool 😎
A kid who sees people dying and evaporated, says - "That was Awesome". What are we making out of our future Generation? Sadists, psychopaths and Sociopaths?
Looks like from director of Koi mil gaya movie
Im confuse hulk star trek avengers
whys that kid got lipstick on?
Yes Yes Yes, did I say YES!  lol
I hate that this looks so interesting... cause I hate the casting. lol oh well.
📍
🔏
📍
📍
📍
wow, that actually looks good...which is surprising given today's decreasing Hollywood standards on quality movies.
I have no idea what this is a sequel of but I'm excited af
Deadpool and hulk together in the same film!
It’s so funny hearing Deadpool calling the Hulk dad.
This sounds like part of the plot of another Netflix show, DARK
Remind me please, from what old movie is melody at 1:37??
RYAN RENOULT IS THE IRON MAN.😎
This looks like a properly made ‘a wrinkle in time’.
I need a time machine so I can watch this now.
This is closer to the plot of _A Wrinkle in Time_ (the book) than _A Wrinkle in Time_ (the movie)
Or oooo....Nobita coming back from future aaaaaaaaah
This is koi mil gya
Love story ❤️
Indian languages also please
Big step for Netflix. This is theatre level shit and they’re releasing it straight to their platform.
It's like Marvel married DC's mom.
I'm gonna watch bc of Ryan gosling. Damn I love that dude
Deadpool holding a lightsaber calling the Hulk "Dad" is something I'd thought I never see.  All jokes aside, this move look so good and somehow Ryan Reynolds has not aged
I am excited to watch this 😍😍😍😍
Hopefully the movie explains what a G is cause now I wanna know.
so hulk is deadpool's dad, gotcha
John Lewis Christmas advert much 😂
Well....this looks horribly mediocre.
Series or Feature?
so.... the hulk is deadpool's dad?
Really hope this isn't another Bright lol it lol it looks really good.
Aye sea u, dew ewe c mi mach eleven?
Awesome...........can't wait!
So Elektra and Hulk gave birth to Deadpool? And now future Deadpool is about to have a relationship with Gamora? Fascinating stuff.
I do not want to see this but Ryan Reynolds AND Mark Ruffolo 😍
Just, deadlpool, hulk and elektra time traveling🤣
hulk, gamora , deadpool: what else you can ask for
I was part of the first group of test screenings for this. You guys are in for a treat!
Love it.... can't wait to watch the movie. (✯ᴗ✯)
Doc : Don't talk to anyone, don't touch anything, don't do anything, don't interact with anyone, and try not to look at anything.
definitely gonna watch it.
this seems a bit too weird
نزلت مقطع جديد اعطوني رايكم👋
Blockbuster trailer 9 star vs blockbusterter movie 5 star 🙄🙄🙄
Love a good time travel story. 👍🖖
I hate watching big movies at home i prefer at theaters
RIP OFF of 2005 Zathura! like come on have some originality.
Omg🙈😍
I love the way the older self and younger self says dad. The young one was hopeful while the older was disappointed. Cant wait for this movie!
all is see is the time when shinchan met his future wife
Eh...more marvel junk.
🔥🔥🔥
I am getting tired of Ryan Gosling.
So this is what Bruce and Wade doing for years?
at least in Deadpool we don't see his face
One of the best trailer 👌👌🔥🔥
Too bad Mark Ruffalo is in it. He's just another woke shill that wants communism to come to America.   Everything else was awesome though
koi mil gaya plot
The worst part is that you cant see the dislikes
It's like. Koi mil gya😍
Love ryan renolds
This gives me Zathura, Star Trek, Indiana Jones, and other early 2000s and 1980s-1990s vibes. And I'm all in for it.
hahah Netflix is worth the 20$ KEEP THE MOVIES AND SHOWS COMING. ILL PAY
DEADPOOL ,HULK AND ELCKTRA,GAMORA😂😂 WHAT A "MARVEL"OUS CASTING🤔 But Why They added The Flash's Music?🙄🙄😐
Another failed plagiarisation with no meaningful content
Is this the sequel to "the kid" starring Bruce willis
I hope Netflix will dubbed this in Hindi
Gamora, hulk and deadpool 😂
that ruffalo pos is a non starter unfortunately.
this this also include a cheesy ad for this guys gin company?
i laaa jadooo 😂😂
This hits me in a deep way - losing my father at 8 and always pretending to be okay.  Learning to throw a spiral by myself, throwing the football at my bedroom wall.....  Wanting to have a conversation with my dad, who died at an age younger than I am now.  Wanting to tell my 8-year-old self all the things I needed to hear back then....  Just to be a kid and it's okay to be not okay.....
Hollywood needs to be boycotted. They're no better than the corrupt media.
This looks fantastic.
watching ...
marvel got into a different project huh
What's Magnus Carlsen doing in the movie XD
It's a theatre material
This trailer looks bada$$, I hope the movie it too.
It's a glimpse of Deadpool working with the rest of the Marvel cast
Ok, the trailer music is epic, but I'm not impressed by the rest of it.
I gave up on such movies, I'm too old I guess for this crap.. xD
The only missing thing from the movie is a board game (i’m talking bout Zathura)
Netflix is high on something.
Ryan Reynolds is in like every movie recently and honestly good for him getting that bag
This reminds me of a trailer from the 90-2000s. Pretty good trailer.
The same thing happens in the movie Zathura
OK I thought … JESUS !! BORING …. But when he said .. yeah this is my watch … I thought COOL… CONNECTION, EMOTIONAL … Not just sci fi. I’m in!
hulk and deadpool NOICE
Deadpool × Hulk✌️
The hulk father of deadpoll
Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Acts 2:38
I can't help but think, 'the Hulk has a son"
This looks really stupid. Also when you faint, you fall forward.
It's mixed with E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, Back to the Future, Lost in Space, Zathura, Jupiter Ascending, Galaxy Quest, Guardians of the galaxy and Star wars.
Hulk is Deadpool's father
Hey, you finally got to team up with the MCU, sort of.
The kid looks old,  no childhood innocence at all
Glad to see Jenna and Matt’s marriage is still going on strong.
What is the release date
Hopefully this one isn't as bad as free guy, like, I like Ryan Reynolds and his style, but i feel like Free Guy was a misstep, hope this puts him back on track
How is this a Teaser?
1:45 That spaceship idea belongs to chicken little 🐥
Idk, even in a more serious role like this Ryan Reynolds seems like he is playing the same character he plays in every movie.
the concept is beyond grandfather paradox. if you go and meet yourself in past. you are changing your own future. cause u will have instant memories of meeting urself nad that changes everything. u'll be stuck in constant loop. even if one does goes back to future.. it will be completely different.. and every  memory u had in new future will suddenly develop in ur mind and either u'll go in coma or die
I AM LIVING THAT JENNA AND MATT ARE MARRIED <3
AHHHH THIS LOOKS SO GOOD
Its like a Marvel movie, but without the license
Its like a wrinkle in time mixed with zathura. Nice
And I just canceled my NF subscription; felt like entering a Mall (all needs to be shinny and new)
I'll check it out because Ryan Reynolds
Plot twist he is a pedophile and come to touch himself younger !
Coffee check,slippers check,relax mode ..on check..lights off...check!let the action beggin!!!
So Multiverse is real....... Where the hulk is a father of Deadpool 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Still has the wreck it Ralph feeling like free guy
Deadpool, Gamora, Hulk and Elektra doing Back to the Future stuff.
Mmm this is something new from NetFlix, no gays, trans and feminists. Weird!
Ryan can't miss.
Sooo someone saw flight of the navigator recently and decided to do it in reverse?
"multiverse of madness" really happened
Drax : I'll do YOU one better, WHY is Gamora?
LOOKS PROMISING AND FKING AWESOME RYAN REYNOLDS IS A PLUS THE KID ALSO DOESNT LOOK BAD 😁
Even the trailer is amazing and fantastic. What about the movie?🎥 It's unimaginable.🤯
Looks like another pile of garbage like Free Guy
this better be as fun as it looks
A new masterpiece with netflix.
I am hooked.
Lol the hulk is green lanterns father
The Hulk îs Deadpool's father 😁😁
Dropping comment  Hoping someone will reply and give netflix I'd and pass 😂🙈
I have no idea what this movie is about other than Ryan Reynolds goes back in time and meets himself as a kid while shooting at bad guys for something. This is the sort of vagueness I want in more trailers, I don't want to know a movie's entire story after a two minute trailer.
zip it green widow
some kind of a kang the conqueror type?
So Deadpool/Green Lantern + Gamora + Hulk + Elektra? Ok :))
Anything left in the plot after this?
Actor’s cv Accent/language: British english, french, german, Ryan Reynolds
Interesting
What's with Ryan Reynolds and his daddy issues
We'll call him adam
So this is where Gamora went. She went and meet Deadpool.
As always, now where would I find the trailer ?
i am in
Looks like a hybrid of ET Frequency Star Wars and Back to the Future
Damn, I wish I were able to go back in time and talk to a younger me. I'd just tell myself: "whatever it is you think you're doing, DON'T!!!"
Waiting for this from india 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🙏
Ryan Reynolds is in everything these days it seems.
See people that's why you don't time travel, now hulk became deadpool's dad.
Bruh imagine knowing youre gonna grow up looking like Ryan Reynolds I would be so pleased
YES. HELL YEAH.
I'll watch it for Ryan Reynolds jokes and Mark Ruffalo.
Free Guy and now this?  Ryan is the hero we need... making unique new movies that aren't remakes ruining our childhood.  So refreshing.
Holy shit, is that Famous Ryan reynolds Playing notoriously classic Ryan Ryenolds in another wild crazy Ryan Reynolds Film featuring ryan reynolds as Ryan Reynolds!?!?
Oooooooooooooohh I'M HYPED
So glad to finally watch a trailer for this movie I'm totally going to watch this next month can't wait for it !
felt like this trailer revealed way too much. I will still be watching this, but in the future, probably worth reducing the trailer around a minute or so :)
what in the zatura universe is this
i swear if they pull a lego movie part 2 plot twist with ryan reynolds imma be very sad
wow
This movie looks expensive 😳... so the fact that its a Netflix movie and there's no IP connected to it that atleast most people know... means BORING.... its Looper ... meets ET meets Marvel/Disney actors bored because why make a movie that will make a Billion Dollars when we can milk Netflix for a movie you'll probably watch once... yet someone in the 3rd world will think its Marvel movie.
I had lost fait after "Red Notice" but HOLY CRAP THIS LOOKS SO PRETTY. This feels well thought, the color palette is amazing and the story looks like it's going to give me the feels.
Awesome
Looks decent
Are all marvel actors just in tuned with each other nowadays or…?
Zathura Remake?
Saw this super bowl commercial.
That BG music just reminded me of  CW "The Flash".
So Deadpool, hulk and gamora in one  movie?? Sign me up Netflix.
Mark Ruffalo is literally one of the most uninteresting actors in Hollywood. Ryan Reynolds will single handedly save this heap from DVD discount bin status.
Well, Imagine that. Hanging out with myself. I think we would get along great!
Now, that price increase doesn’t seem so hard to swallow. Keep it up, Netflix.
this has to be the laziest most uninspired thing ive ever seen .... why just why?
I don't like sci-fi or action but Ryan Reynolds, mark ruffalo, Zoe Saldana in one movie! Must watch for me
He has a ship like the game "Chorvs" 🤔
Dark 😂
How can a movie about time travel feel so underwhelming?
Finally coming out with some good stuff!
Ryan Reynold lets go!
Só they’re taking parts from Zathura. Cool. Cool.
Woooaahh
It look like a superhero movie
It looks like a good movie with a very good storyline and plot. It look like it has a sense of coping with emotional turmoil and character development.
Oh I'm locked in on this..yes!!!
Holy shit I can’t wait
Omgeee I can't wait 😍😍😍
zathura moment
Marvel 52 - Deadpool and hulk re inventing themselves.
This reminds me of Zathura
It looks good actually.
The story is what sold me. I'm in.
Ryan Reynolds always, always, always plays Ryan Reynolds. He's like the Owen Wilson of Vince Vaughns.
So it's like, the tommorows war but more friendly
I don't think Ryan Reynolds ever takes a day off.
I've been wondering for a while what happened to all the GREAT MOVIES (Raiders, Star Wars, ET, Goonies, etc.) and why we haven't had any in so very long. Looks like we're getting one.
🔥❣
Ryan could just sit in a room and it would be an amazing movie.
I love the music in this trailer, really epic!
Will this be in theaters to watch? Definitely deserves to be viewed on the big screen.
This looks so beautiful and interesting
Zathura on steroids. I'm game. Need a Dax cameo
Looks cool. Unfortunately, it has Mark Ruffalo in it so I’ll pass.
Ahhh
rarely that you get goosebumps when you look at a trailer these days.
INITIAL D Anime Netflix 😭
ew it's ryan reynolds...pass!
Starman?
Missing the dislike button right now
I'm in though Saldona and Garner are getting old add some new young fresh meat and my manliness will be happy
Ryan Reynolds playing the green lantern from the opposite position lol
Ryan just plays himself in every movie and I'm all for it
Só consegui lembrar do filma zatura sério mesmo.😒
So excited to watch this with my son ♥️ hopefully they won’t promote homosexuality again🤞🏼
This reminds me of Zathura...
"Adam phone home"
So ya I'm probably going to watch this. It looks awesome
I'm getting Last Starfighter vibes and I'm totally here for it. And Reynolds, obviously.
Looks dope
Why does this movie feel like a damn fanfiction lmaoo Wow just wow
I thought this was a Bioshock movie
Something like zathura
pls dont be a 2nd red notice. i hope it actually has a good script
Ahhhhhhh my friend is the little boy (walker scobell)
Meh....
how does Netflix have this much money????
Well I know what I'm doing March 11th.
I know I’m gonna sound crazy, but that kid Walker Scobell goes to my school and we’re friends and he’s pretty cool.
Mark Ruffalo is in it, you just saved me time to watch something else lol
That's funny. I saw that kid and he immediately reminded me of Ryan Reynolds. Tried to remember if he has a son. Then thought nah, I think he just got some daughters. Must be a coincidence. AND then Ryan Reynolds is in this movie and the kid is supposed to be him!?! CRAZY!
Dammit this looks awesome!
I WISH THIS WAS REAL I WOULD LOVE TO GO BACK AND JUST CHANGE ONE THING.
This doesn't look good to be completely honest.
so i l be subscribing Netflix on 11 march
I count 3 movies ripped off in that trailer.....
When the couple from “13 Going On 30” had a Child that turned out to be Ryan Reynolds from the Future.
Remember pre deadpool when Ryan Reynolds would make absolute shit and no one cared. Now here he is post deadpool making the same shit and everyone completely buzzes over him 😂
‘From the director, star and producers of Free Guy’ yeah I’m gonna give this one a miss I think
Please don't suck
Will someone please stop Ryan Reynolds making shit movies. Is he behind on his taxes? How many turkeys will he make before all that good will is lost and audiences stop overlooking the fact he’s a completely one dimensional actor that does one thing, be Ryan Reynolds in different badly written films. You can only dine out on Deadpool for so long.
this is like that one old movie with 2 kids playing the board game and stuff uk??
maybe it's finally time to get a netflix account...
Imagine Hulk Deadpool and Gamora working together
😑 march 11 is far why not 28 feb
HOLY SHI-
Wow this looks good!
Woah I’m so hyped
Hulk, Deadpool & Gamora😂
Wow wow am already hyped can't wait
Okay, now I know everything. What a teaser.
❤️
I refuse to watch anything with Ryan Renolds he’s so goddamn obnoxious
👍😊
The Hulk and Deadpool in the same movie?! Yes, Hell yes!! 🎉🥳
13 GOING ON 30 FANS WYA T__T jennifer and mark back together,, makes my heart warm!!
Giving flight of the navigator vibes honestly.
Omg Jen and Mark?? I loved 13 going on 30
this is basically a sequel to zathura
ele tem cabelo loiro quando pequeno
Maybe this is a good time to publish my time travel novel! @Netflix unless you would like first crack at it? let me know... at the least, you get to read a great story.
sadly it's probably a movie cus ryan reynolds is in it, im just sad cus series are usually longer.
😀
0:40 seconds in and it looks sick already. ryan reynolds and time travel too??? okay
This…looks interesting
i'm crying tears of joy, i'm legit crying because of how much i love the premis of the movie
Elektra and Hulk. Then comes Deadpool.
feels like music is inspired from 'fantastic beast and where to find them'
Why this shit not releasing in theaters...sad 😢
Dumb movie. Dumb Reynolds.
This gave me Zathura vibes for some reason. Only because they're the same person thing. Just like in Zathura when you find out the astronaut is just the older brother from the future.
Ryan Reynolds❤🙏🏻🔥
Ryan Reynolds again 😝
Deadpool, Hulk, Gomorrah, Elektra, and a lucky little boy lol. Looks awesome!!🙌🤩
Another Dumbflix production wow! I’m looking forward to not seeing it!
Deadpool 3 looks good👍
Deadpool meeting Hulk
Aaaahhhh makes me nervous. How do they address the time traveling rules and physics is what I'll be wondering til this comes out
Green Lantern In Another Universe 😎
love every Ryan Reynolds movie!
Wait!! Deadpool is Bruce's son!!!! 😱😱😱😱
Otra serie que dejará Netflix a medias como la mayoría de su cartel
How is this a Netflix film?? Amazing
This looks awesome. Really shows you that there's no gap between Netflix movies and traditional major studio movies anymore.
I thought the person in the thumbnail was John Krasinski
Here for Jenna and Matt (13 going on 30) comments.
Wow Time Travel....😎
Yooo I love it but ngl kinda gave me *Peabody and Sherman* vibes 🔥👌
So Deadpool is son of Hulk ...! 😀
Now that's a my kinda movie! The cast is awesome. I am in...
Tanie przełączniki samochodowe z alliexpres w kabinie, ciekawa ta przyszłość :D
remember zathura? yeah gave me vibes of that. looks cool
This could’ve been in theaters
letssss gooooo
Oh yeah!
난 왜 여기서 아르고스의 노래가 들리지 ㅋㅋㅋ
🔥🔥🔥🚒🚒🚒
What a shame Ruffalo is in it. Might have yo pass.
wah!!!what was that!!!awesome 😍😍😍
Well already know the whole plot now
Reminds me of - Zathura: A Space Adventure - not mad at it though
This is the type of movie you watch in the cinemas, not the house 😩
Hulk, Deadpool, Gamora
There are two ways I see this trailer :  1) Flashback to 13 going 30 2) Bruce Banner becomes the father of Wade Wilson who coincidently fights side by side with Gamora
Looks like a fun movie. Cant wait
Holy guacamole this looks incredible!!!
I am just happy to see Mark Ruffalo here. Thanks
Verithanama irukku 🔥
A Definitive Watch 😁
This hits! It's feels like a Flight of the Navigator story I loved growing up. Now I have a son, I get to watch something like this with him. It's going to be emotional.
2 minutes into the movie, Am i watching Zathura?
I'm so hyped for this!!!
Finally a movie where Ryan Reynolds doesn't play himself?
Ryan Reynolds is the same thing in every movie, and it somehow works
i thought it was going to be a nice chill classic type story and movie , bit old fashioned .... but then the super sonic planes and the dumb ass jedi looking swords came out and RUINED IT AS ALWAYS.
Marvel? or 13 going 30?  happy to see Matt and Jenna togther again
This 13 Going On 30 sequel took a radical turn. Looks good tho.
Omg. Looks exciting
wow!
I hope Jackman is in the movie 😆
Deadpool, Hulk, Elektra and Gamora walk into a bar.... it sounds like the start of a bad joke, but this movie looks kinda good!
i miss my Dad too
I'd watch anything with Ryan Reynolds in it.. and I think they knows that.
Waiting waitng for this ❤️❤️❤️❤️
so Gamora teams up with Wade and Banner romances Elektra. The multiverse is out of hand.
“Meet the Reynolds’s “
That is a really good trailer.
why adam?
What ? Bruce Banner is Wade Wilson Father ??
Hair color doesn't match
I came here for the lightsaber Ryan Reynolds wields in the thumbnails...
Ryan Reynold's characters should all just be named Ryan Reynolds at this point. lol
omg hhh amazing
Christmas came early
Flight of the Navigator X Enemy Mine X Super 8
You know Ryan kept making things akward on set calling Mark Ruffalo Daddy.
anyone else get Tommorowland vibes from the score?
This is why Netflix is my number 1 streaming service!
They shouldn't have revealed that its Present Vs Future Self of kid
Future ADAM: Try not to pass out from the g's. Kid ADAM: What's a... JESUS...    That kid really is the future version of Ryan Reynolds. !!!!
Everything in the movie is VR, the kid uses it to cope with the lost of his father.
Netflix I swear.
So in this universe hulk gave birth to deadpool , and deadpool comes from the future to meet himself as a kid
Can't wait to watch this
RYAN REYNOLDS AND MARK RUFFALO PLAYING FATHER AND SON ?! 😲
🤯 another star wars movie with Deadpool woooooah
Revelation 9 New International Version 9 The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth.  The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss. 2 When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened  by the smoke from the Abyss.  3 And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth.
This movie is gonna be totally awesome
Huh so that's where Gamora was 😲
so the kid they had after 13 going on 30 is dreaming of a future where he looks like deadpool and pairs up with gamora. cool.
If I was a Netflix shareholder, I would advocate for launching movies on Theaters because last 2 years has been golden on new ips and originals movies!
You know you're trying to save a buck or two when your bloody trailers aren't in 4K.
not the most promising vfx, sorry
If your reading this I just want to tell you that its not an accident your seeing this.  Jesus loves you and He died on the Cross to save you from your sins and that you might have life and go not in hell for all of eternity, it is a free gift cannot be obtained in good works or doing good or whatsoever but by believing in Him(Jesus). Repent turn back to God, Return to Him.   For what can pornography, masturbation, anime, ungodly movies, video games, fornication, idolatry, drugs and etc, can profit you? They might satisfy you temporarily but in the long run they will make you more depressed sad and empty and broken. Nothing in this world can satisfy our hearts, in fact you will just begin to desire more and more of that thing you are addicted to and not being satisfied. that thing you feel, like emptiness sadness and depression are results of this wrong choices we made thinking that it will make us feel better or happy but the truth is the exact opposite. You may have already tried everything to try to feel happy and find meaning and purpose in life, you might already tried having a Girlfriend or Boyfriend. But you still feel like there is something missing. You know, Jesus is the only answer to it all, He is the only one who can satisfy the heart He is the only one who can give you true Happiness and your purpose in life can only be found in Him.   If you want to accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior pray this with your heart.  "Lord Jesus have Mercy on me for I am sinner Forgive me of all my sins, Lord I accept you as my Lord and Savior of my Life change me, transform me. I believe that I am reborn and that in your second coming you will take me to your kingdom. Amen"

Very very good movie
I really can’t wait to see this I’m literally screaming, anything with Ryan Reynolds is a huge plus, mark ruffalo & Jennifer garner. ❤️💯
Wow this looks amazing!!!!!!!!
alright hear me out, this somewhat feels like an  imagined order agent's story.
Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner together!? again!? I'm in!!!
The first seconds of this trailer really gave me “Iron Giant” feels ❤️  Even though I knew it wasn’t, still felt disappointed ☹️
Wow, this looks so good!
It's really make me think about Major Victory, Vance astrovik from Marvel Comics. Like a looooooot.  It's a bit weird.
JENNIFER GARNER SUPREMACY
Whoa cool this seems like a blast
banger
Gemini Man 2..
Sr sto nino inri holy rosary
The scene where they looked at each other reminds me of a scene from Zathura 😅 can’t wait to watch this
I can see why they're raising our sub prices
So... Yep.
Woah 🤯
so sick of everything coming out in March, i wanna watch it now!
Daaaaaaammmmmmmmmnnnnnnnn
13 going on 30 sequel
Jennifer Garner had the best marvel movie out of anyone in this cast. 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
Oh yes, I'm sold!
this movie is incrdible
This is so stupid
This looks good
Mark Ruffalo is trash, just wanted to say that
It's giving me Zathura vibes and an Au of 13 going on 30 all in one. I can't wait.
Is that Ryan Reynolds?
This movie VFX is going to set new Standard.
Add and Otter some place in the movie and I will have everything that is Awesome.
Im excited....it looks awesome!!
Hulks son, who's mom is Elektra, who is a grown up Deadpool working with Gamora.
Spoiler . . . . . . . . . We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy  I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand  Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Would be cool to watch it in IMAX
Totally going to be worth the wait!!  Don't disappoint me! Don't disappoint me! Don't disappoint me!!!
Goosebumps after a lonng time , its gonna be a good one
So much talent in 1 movie can't wait!!!
Is this in the 13 going on 30 universe?...jk
Disney will sue for lightsaber rights
The last "Adam Project" almost ended humanity
he's using a lightsaber?
Nice
this looks so good ogm
Sooo Hulk and Deadpool together. Huh!! Nice...
the music is giving me a zathurah feels
Deadpool, Hulk, Gamora and Elektra in one movie.
At this point Ryan Renolds can just do whatever with his career
Cool
Very cool, I will definitely be watching this one!
Omg
I know what's the G ;)
Elektra and the Hulk
Antman’s father is The Hulk🤡
Wow, love it already
Is this going to be in multiverse of madness?
Who else thought ohh so deadpool is hulk's son and is dating gamora .starlord will be pissed😅😂
Hum Mark Ruffalo and Ryan Rinolds at the same serie & the main topic is Time travel jajajajajaja suspicious?!
Interesting. Consider me intrigued.
I wonder when will I see Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson acts in a movie.
It's like Bruce Willis's "the Kid" butt with action I guess...
THIS IS LITERALLY JUST A SEQUEL TO ZATHURA. EVEN THE SOUNDTRACK
So many bankable DC Comics/MCU vets!  That's THE guarantee to always get a part in an action or Sci-Fi movie. Kudos to them getting "recycled" in other universes, can't wait to watch this new movie.
Trailer was good hope I will enjoy watching movie in cinema
Please tell me that this is Zathura 2. The idea that “I’m you from the future but from space” and the way the adult version of the character opened the fridge is just so familiar.
A movie that actually looks really good and is not part of some huge franchise? They actually have my attention.  Ironic that this feels more like it could be a TV show than most serialized TV shows do. ha I am sure if it does well, we're in for a film series. But I could be happy with a single really well done film too. Finally something to pay attention to on Netflix again.
I loved Free Guy, I have high expectations for this one ☺️
Getting some E.T wibes here
This looks fun, looking forward to this
This looks amazing. Can’t wait to see it
It feels weird to think the hulk as the father of deadpool😅
I'm sooo watching this.
Hulk is Deadpool's dad confirmed??
looks good
Ok so I forgive Ryan for his feud with our Hugh. This looks seriously awesome and has a few feels moments. Got to love creativity and the power to dream. Thanks Netflix, my heart is a beating happy beats.
Never knew they would give us Deadpool and Gamora partnering up together
I saw the trailer on Ryan’s IG and I was sooo hyped! 🤣💯✨
GARNER IS DIVINE. IL SURE WATCH THIS
It will available in tamil
It's deadpool and the hulk in a sick series looks amazing
13 Going on 30 finally got a sequel 🔥😂
I am so ready for thisssssssss
Finally, Zathura sequel
Why the black actress everytime
Ryan Reynolds is the iron giant  Coming this fall on video and DVD
Aweesssommmee 👌
Well now I just want a 13 going on 30 sequel
I swear if Mark called Ryan "Dad" and Ryan is supposed to be the kid from the future than this is some Futurama shit, that kid became his own Grandfather
Time travel exists.
Anyone knows the name of this tune? I've heard it in many trailers ...and i like it
That's why I love Netflix. Can't wait to watch this movie.
this reminds me of 'meet the robinsons'...
Deadpool, gamora, hulk and Elektra in a movie together sweet
Star wars featuring Deadpool, hulk, Elektra and gamora
Deadpool, hulk and gamora in one epic film, Crazy.
The budget for Netflix originals have gone up astronomically throughout the years There's really no point of movie theaters if this is what comes out of digital streaming
Deadpool, gamora, the hulk, and elektra? How cool.. lol
i swear netflix is getting better at casting
1980s nerdgasm, The Last Starfighter with a side of future Wars, a bit of Star Man or Flight of the Navigator
Why are so many trailers coming out right now??
Deadpool's dad is Hulk😹😹😹
Hulk has a son 😱😱😱😨😨 and he grows up to be Deadpool 😳😨😱😱
Whoa!
Goosebumps starts from here 02:05 with this amazing background music
This Trailer Gives Me Chill, Like I Was Feel In Childhood. <3
From the profile this kid looks exactly like Freddy Highmore
Ryan Renolds🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great Marvel movie with Deadpool,Hulk and Gamora
It's just awkward when Deadpool's dad is the Hulk. 😅🤣
Ryan Reynolds never  disappoint$!!...
once  I Thought .... it is copy of bollywood movie  Koi mil gaya  .... that starting part 😂😂😂
Finally, Ryan Reynolds plays a serious character after such a long time playing Deadpool in most of his movies
കിളി
Now picture our black ancestors and you have the Real God
Hey, waitaminute, is this another MCU movie?
How does Netflix keep knocking it out of the park so much?
This is just a 13 going on 30 sequel and you cannot convince me otherwise
looks good
I like him but I’m getting kinda tired of Ryan Reynolds’s playing himself in every movie…
Sorry lost interest when I seen Mark Ruffalo.
The music was gave me extreme Dr Who vibes In the forest. Kind of like Matt smiths doctor. The twinkling xylophone
Zathura
Jesus is Lord😘🌹
13 going on 30 looks different
loooove this!
The 13 Going on 30 and Back to the Future cross over we never knew that we needed
Iron Giant vibes
Like if 13 going on 30 was set in zathura's universe
Reminds me of zathura.
Netflix hasn't failed me yet!!!!!
alright no more space cakes for you
I'm a little concerned that the trailer gave too much but maybe I am wrong. I hope this will be worth watching.
OMG 4 MARVEL ACTORS? THIS BETTER BE GOOD, IM SO EXCITED TO SEE MARKS CHARACTER
It seems Ryan Reynolds is trying to rich to the Oskar position. His acting performance is getting better. I hope this movie will be the best acting performance by him.
Movie or series???
Surprised so many people are hyped. That's good I guess. Not for me though.
In reality time travel is impossible. But it’s cool to fantasy about it with movies 🍿
You got deadpool, gamora, hulk and elektra.
Is that kid wearing lipstick?
👍🏻
Very good
13 going on 30 part 2
Kinda feel like I saw the whole movie just by watching this teaser/trailer... Honestly hate when they make teasers or trailers like this, Like the only thing they didn't show was the ending.. They left nothing up to the suspense or for the viewer to feel curious about and  try to guess and figure out throughout watching the movie... And it even sounds and looks like a promising movie, but like... Whenever they make teasers and trailers like this where they show so much of the plot in it, I really feel less of a urge to go watch it,  you know what I mean? Anyway.. That's just my opinion, and obviously I'm going to watch it. Because Ryan Reynolds, that's why mf'ers. But yo, anyone else feel the same about teasers/trailers like this where just reveal so much that you feel like you know the entire plot beforehand? :-l
Time travel, without paradoxes and apparent problems, more fantasy less sci-fi. But still sci-fi!😅 The BGM and the trailer brings some childhood memories of some sci-fi movies of 90s
In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. Acts 17:30.
I hope I’m not the only one that considers this a canon sequel to 13 going on 30
The fool says in his heart,     “There is no God.” They are corrupt, and their ways are vile;     there is no one who does good.. Psalms 53:1.
Looks Epic, now it's time to watch this trailer over and over again a few million times before March 11.   I already have I AM A TIME TRAVELER 👨‍✈🚀🌠
eita, tres minutos de um teaser
This gives me the very rare E.T., Star Wars, Back to the Future vibes: The whole family can watch--and it's comedy everyone can enjoy. Man, this brought back all the 80's movies feels. Especially that one with the kids and the map, and there are Baby Ruths and a pirate ship, and then they're kidnapped by Thanos. Classic.
The sci-fi sequel to 13 going on 30
what a fvcking sick trailer can't wait to see this amazing project.
Christine, hulk and Deadpool make a good trio
Interesting
I like the sense of wonderment
So Hulk is Deadpool's dad!!!
Why is the Netflix logo there throughout the teaser? It’s so distracting.
This movie looks AMAZING! The biggest surprise was that it was coming out on Netflix!🤯😅 I'm totally fine with that btw, it just felt like a summer blockbuster kinda movie and I was expecting to see a summer release date instead of the March 11th release date. So yeah I'm Happily surprised and can't wait to see this now!
Whoever did the casting deserves a raise.
Hell yeah, we got Elektra, Hulk, Deadpool, Gamorra, time travel, and cosmic storyline with a little blonde-haired white boy... I love it now who's gonna let me use their account?! LOL
11th March is my birthday!!! A damn birthday present for me ❤️❤️❤️
just waiting from now on
Teaser?
Now thats how you make a trailer
this is so cool
Deadpool, Gamora, and Hulk, dream team up lol
It's Jenna and Matty!
Eh.
Ryan with his comedic timing
this 13 going on 30 sequel looks so good <3
The best part is 4 of the big-name actors are marvel stars. Jennifer Garner - Elektra Mark Ruffalo - Hulk/Banner Ryan Renolds - Deadpool Zoe Saldana - Gamora
Timmy turner and his future self
I'm sold!
On one hand I am really really really burnt out on science fiction adventure stories (and my teenage self would jump through a worm hole or whatever and beat me to hear that) on the otherhand the cast looks entertaining.
From the director, star and producer of Free Guy. 😂😂😂🤣
Please be good, please be good, please be good
😳💯💥❤️👍
Deadpool and Hulk together. This movie is going to be awesome 🔥
Crap! I just canceled Netflix.
Marvel cast's? sign me up bro
If sm try to faint on me, I know what to do 😂
Casting good but story!! Little confusing
Where does this fall in the MCU timeline?
I guess Im ok with the price increase now
The editor deserves a raise.
Deadpool's father hulk twist 😂
Deadpool meets the Hulk meets Elektra. The crossover that I never thought I would ever see 😆
Hope it doesn't suck
Oh my gods, my 13 going on 30 heart ❤
Netflix be killing me with the trailers.  3 mins? Just show me the whole movie 🤣
I really like Shawn Levy
The cast, though.
Holy Jesus😯😯😯
Gamora, Deadpool and Hulk. Nice!!
zathura vibe
This is a 20-year history in the making and beyond. It's deeper than a movie.
White Adam vs Black Adam!
Basically a metaverse movie
reminds me of zathura
Feels like " zathura:a space adventure"
this reminds me of zathura
Plss bring gods vs kong on Netflix
The Hulk, Gamora, dead pool and Elektra
Deadpool , Hulk, Electra and Gamora in the same movie. 😂
At first I thought it was about his dad coming back from space, it gave me hope...
zathura
Looks good except for resting bitch face Jennifer Garner. Cant stand her.
Will Jacksepticeye be in this film?
I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW JEN GARNER AND MARK RUFFALO KISSING OMG
Elektra gonna make you some Cheerios bitches.
Usually, 9.5 out of 10 Netflix movies suck... But the cast alone in this make me want to watch it, Ryan and Mark are so charismatic.
Wow.
Hulk and Deadoool. Well, this is not what I was expecting when they introduced Multiverse in the MCU
just the CASTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hulk and gamorra finally meet deadpool....so hypeeeee
Revealing trailer.  About the only secret left from watching the trailer is what happened to the dad
Who is Adam and what is so interesting about his bitch ass that he gets his own project on him
bro march 11 is my birthday
I love me a good time travel movie, and with this cast? I'm in!
AAAAAWWWWWEEEESOME TRAILER
so-so
This looks like lots of fun. Let's just hope they don't interject any kind of "wokeness" into it.
When even men go „ooooh cute“
WHY DOES THIS SEEM GOOD AND NOT CRINGEY
Wow just the trailer alone brought me to tears I can’t wait to see this.
Walker was the perfect choice for the kid role. He is cute, funny and awesome. Everything Ryan is
'The future self coming from space' reminded me of the movie Zathura: A Space Adventure from the Jumanji franchise.
“Thirty and flirty and thriving.” –Adam Rink-Flamhaff
first thing I would be amazed by seeing my old house and my old me. But here. Well, here there is Ryan Reynolds.
The boy is extremely well casted.
Nice!
Guardians of the Galaxy 3
I AM considering this a canon 13 going on 30 sequel, thank you.
Mark Socialist ruins movie.
NOT vaccine according to definition pre covid hysteria.
1:00
Movie pitch, "We're going to take MCU cast members and put them in a sci-fi blender with Ryan Reynolds making whimsical commentary!"  Netflix, "Take our money."
Taken some inspiration from ET i see.
The visual effects of this movie 🎥 is total awesome
can't wait!!
So all the Marvel heroes are getting Netflix movies🤷🏽‍♀️.. I’m not mad about it 🤗
I’m not a kid but this makes me feel like one again!
My 6 and 10 years daughters can wait for this movie! They love Ryan Reynold’s and his movies are always family friendly we can’t wait 😝
Deadpool, hulk, elektra, and gamora?? lol
Season 5 of green house academy please
Whoever did the casting  deserves a raise
Is it only me or someone also felt music is inspired frm Now you See Me. My views, no hard feelings :-)
The boy looks nothing like Ryan Reynolds but looks good lol
*_Nice to see Jen and Mark together again.Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner are together again on the screen. It's Kuruto!)))_*
Its An A List Cast with a Disney junior type of story...kids will definitely like it
Not worth it
So is this a sequel to 13 going on 30?
💙💙💙💙💙 💙💙 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Imagine finding out you're Ryan Reynolds in the future.
Seriously, first blockbuster movie feeling from Netflix. They have upped their game
This film looks interesting.
Hulk, Deadpool and Gamora... What???
Can't wait!
Looks like fun
I wanna live in this world
If I didnt see the netflix logo. You would think its a marvel movie! Amazing cast! Glad to see Jennifer Garner again!
Dead pool Incredible Hulk Gamora   All in one movie!!!!!!!
Holy shit hulk was deadpool's father.. ?
with that much Gs i guess 5G wasnt bad
This looks much better than After Earth.
That kid really looks like a young ryan reynolds
ZATURA: SPACE ADVENTURE    FEELS.
Hit the like button if you are a fellow Adam 👆🏼😂
Bruce Banner: Deadpool?? Deadpool: Dad!  😂😂😂
2:32  "What's a G... sus"  Great line.
Ryan Reynolds, Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner . The  cast is amazing 👏
I thought it was Emran Hasmi on the thumbnail. And i clicked! Anyone else?? 😅
Jenna and Matt are still married 😍
This movie looks so good
This trailer convinced me that Hollywood has a roster of exactly 10 actors.
Ok that a light saber
Quiero verla!!!
So Deadpool is now the Hulk's & Jedi's baby.
Didn't Will Smith already do this movie?
siuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Jennifer Garner better be kicking ass as well in this. You know she's very capable but unfortunately relegated to _just_ "mom roles."
almost teared up <3
I definitely need to see Gamora and Deadpool kiss and Jenna and Matt after the wedding.
I hope it's a film and not a series. It would suck as a series
RYAN, ZOEY, JENNIFER and MARK!!! like what?
So Hulk is Deadpool's father and Elektra is Deadpool's mother. Interesting. Oh and Gamora is here too.
Is this  really Teaser ?
I don't know why but this gave me a little feeling like zathura: a space adventure
So is this a sequel to 13 going 30 or what???
Why does this feel like a movie that should be in theaters? I felt like I was watching so long-awaited beginning film of a trilogy. Kind of like the feeling I use to get when watching trailers for Hunger Games films or Maze Runner. Makes it anxious for more.
The hulk and deadpool in one movie damn can't wait!!
Is this already out on Netflix
All Marvel cast! 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Deadpool uniting the Marvel and DC universes one movie at a time!
This looks promising. Then I google this movie, the director was Shawn Levy. I must watch this.
*adds to Watchlist*
the director is Shawn Levy!! SO EXCITED FOR THIS!
holy shit
Imagine meeting yaself and u a fuckin time traveler bruh
nice to see my “raised premiums” aren’t just going to the CEO.
Where is Hindi trailer
Not since back to the future movies have we seen a movie like this wow.
MCU assembled where Deadpool, Hulk and Gamora are all working together. Also this looks so exciting, can't wait
this is giving me heavy zuthura vibes (plus jen/mark!) so the early 2000s nostalgia is real rn
😭😭
commercial pic of shit movies
1:36 where you going?
Ryan Reynolds is ET
This looks like fun! And really great cast on this one!
Deadpool, Hulk, Gamora, and Elektra all on one. This is epic.  Also Netflix is not pulling any punches this year
YES to original IP.
Ryan Reynolds The Only Guy In Hollywood who is still making entertaining movies. with least woke stuff in it.
Holy-- That's classified ... Shit Damn it you little weasel
What If Male Cleaner and Eli from Kin is Collaborating with Adam?
Love that Jennifer & Mark are back on screen together & how funny is it they seem to have time leaped to have a son who time travels 🙃
It's Hollywood let's be honest probably will be woke
I hope this movie is better than his past 2 Netflix films because (6 Underground) was terrible & (Red Notice) was ok
This is an incredible cast.  This looks like an great fun movie.
I'm getting Flight of the Navigator vibes from this film.
26 going on 60
This is giving me Zathura vibes and more!
Hum... j adore ryan reynolds mais un petit humain qui vit seule avec sa mère, se fait maltraiter à l ecole puis qui pars dans un vaisseau spatiale et qui se bat avec l actrice de gamora et qui a un père avec l acteur de hulk, 1 ere chose que je me suis dit: oh mais en fait c est le 1 er gardien de la galaxie en un tout petit peu différent...
Ryan Reynolds with another hit!! 🔥🔥💯
Deadpool and Gamora kicking ass together ?  Star Lord's going to be pissed 😅😅
So each time Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds, no need to actually work, the director says : Ryan Just be you, ACTION
Ryan Reynolds are on fire these years!
Hulk , Deadpool , Gamora & Elektra in one movie. Stop right there.. I'm in...
Deadpool, Hulk and Gamora. I'm ready to watch.
i completed the whole movie but i'll probably still watch it
The cast, the trailer editing, the music, the feeling of mystery. I dont know but this trailer got me excited to watch this and I hope it delivers. Another trailer that gave me this feeling recently is the Lightyear one.
This looks fun and interesting 😳 Im excited
So Hulk and Elektra are Deadpool's parents?
Oh my god this looks like so much fun, hopefully it can remain original and not stray into formula
Ok, sold.
Looks awesome. Gnarly
What if deadpool is really the son of hulk?  it just pop out into my imaginative brain...haha
wouoldnt touching your past self create a wormhole in space and time?
Goosebumps, my guy.
Im honestly glad Netflix has become a success and profitable to be able to make a profit and fund high profit movies.
I.......have no idea what this is about.
13 going on 30 SEQUEL WOOHOOOOO
im excited to see the producer of free guy is working on a new Sci-Fi film or series this is probably going to be a good series to watch with the family even with Ryan Reynolds involved
9 years ago (I was 11 at the time) I wrote a short story about a kid whose future self is a part of a time travel agency and takes him through time to chase a bad guy. I won second place in a short story contest and I haven't thought about it much since, but this reminded me about it. If Netflix deletes this comment, I'll know they used my story. Looks awesome though!
A sci-fi/action time travel movie with Ryan Reynolds, Zoe Saldana, Mark Ruffalo, and Jennifer Garner? Sign me up.
This is the continuation of 13 Going On 30, right?
🤩🤩🤩🤩
Looks very promising though, I liked free guy however ending was quite goofy, I liked that movie also have good hopes and expectations from this one too.
I AM SO IN
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life
This looks promising. Then I google this movie, the director was Shawn Levy. I must watch this.
Not Deadpool calling Hulk "dad".
looks pretty good.  always nice to see ryan reynolds play....... ryan reynolds.......again....
I saw this movie a few months ago in a sneak preview. It's soooo freaking good! I can't wait to watch it again
The music and everything makes it sound exactly like the sort of movie we'd love to watch as a kid.  And that's awesome.
WAIT, HOLD ON. This feels so much like Zathura
I got big ass Zathura vibes from certain parts of this, looks amazing can't wait to watch
THIRTEEN GOING ON THIRTY REUNION 🔥❤️
I believe that Ryan Reynolds starred in this role only to call Mark Ruffalo, Dad
Deadpool gamora and hulk in one movie wow this feels like a marvel movie
So, Deadpool, Elektra, Gamora and Bruce Banner, eh?   *I'm in.*
im just grateful that they still putting an original stuff
Definitely looking forward to this.
If anyone complains how Hollywood is run out of ideas tell them they aren’t those movies just come out on streaming services instead of the theaters now lol
Netflix knows how to create hype by casting fanfav actors 👌
if someone had to explain this movies plot badly :- deadpool steals starlords ship and girlfriend to meet his father hulk with his previous self and has to fight star wars style in the process 😂😂😂
Mark Ruffalo, the only bad choice in actors in this
Well this is clearly gonna take the number 1 spot for a few weeks
The Hulk, Deadpool & Elektra
I don't know. Freeguy was a pile of garbage.
I feel like I saw a lower budget predecessor to this movie with a black kid who found an alien gun but then was later revealed as a gun from the future and he had something to do with it. It was a movie that flew under the radar even though it was pretty fun to watch. I can't even remember it's name.
Wow 🔥🔥
This is really amazing lineup
Any thing time travel involves I am in.
Dang okay Netflix trying to compete with Marvel 😂😂😭
If you like Biden so much name three of his complete sentences...Let's Go Brandon!..FJB💯
So...Elektra and the Hulk had a son who ended up as Deadpool who happens to be in a somewhat implied romantic relationship with Gamora. Ok, got it.
You sure this is just a teaser?
adventure😇
Ok now deadpool can react to this trailer with hulk😂
Elektra and Hulk's son is Deadpool?
Hopefully i don't see any "deadpool-ish" kinda character anymore. It's getting very boring already.
Ryan fans ❤️💜❤️ From India TamilNadu
I will definitely watch this, especially after seeing Mark and Ryan playing as father and son... IM HYPED
Somewhere on background Nick Fury is watching and saying “Motherf@€ker”
Another overly netflixed trash bag of no writing and just lots of Netflix
Ryan reynolds in it im sold
This looks awesome. Really shows you that there's no gap between Netflix movies and traditional major studio movies anymore.
This looks promising. Then I google this movie, the director was Shawn Levy. I must watch this.
Ryan : "Time travel exists" Deadpool fans : "We know" 😂 🤣  I can't wait for the movie to come out I really want to see it after seeing this teaser trailer
Happy to see Deadpool, Gamora, Hulk and Elektra teaming up to defend the universe
Their exact ironic question..When?
JENN AND MARK TOGETHER AGAIN THIS IS SOOOO GOOD
3.02 minutes teaser??? Why don't call it trailer???
Looks like a fun ride!!!
Why are they making these cringe worthy movies lol 🤔
The time travel explanation given in the avengers ruined my feeling about this movie.
Wow
COVID 19 VACCINES ARE NOT VACCINES!!!  . I AM BEING SHADOW BANNED BY COMMUNIST YOUTUBE TO SILENCE THE TRUTH TO KEEP THE MASS AT BAY UNTO SUBMISSION OF THERE AGENDA OF ECONOMIC RESET THAT IS COMING FROM ALL KNOWN, AND ALL PLANNED COVID 19.  THIS WAR IS SPIRITUAL, AND NOT NATURAL. answer. JESUS CHRIST...
You have to wonder whether ryan reynolds is specifically asking for a lightsaber in these movies
She's acting again 😊 ELEKTRA
Please tell me this is getting a theatrical release. I would pay good money to see this in theaters!
Deadpool calling Hulk “father” is a whole new mood 😍😂
Finally we got a trailer for something that is not 11 months away.
Thats Awesome)
Too bad this will never receive a physical media release. Thanks a lot Netflix.🙄
Now this is sick
Netflix should start releasing movies in Cinemas
I feel like this will be referenced in a future marvel movie with Deadpool and the hulk…
Marty McFly: Welcome to the club kid  🤝🏼
Doctor Who doesnt agree with this movie.
Ryan Rodney reynolds
canceled my   Netflix a few years ago over Netflix's politics.   Looks like a Great Movie though
Where r u going
Netflix really tryna get my 20 bucks a month..
Finally got to see ryan reynold doing different personas that he usually does.
The Hulk is Deadpool's Dad and Gamora is Deadpool's girlfriend. I'm in!!
Inspired by Zathura
Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner after 18 years together in a film? How awesome! AND Ryan Reynolds? Damn! A must watch!^^
Wow wtf wow
CMOON ZATHURA
One word... RYANREYNOLDS!!!!!! ♥️♥️♥️😍😍😍😍
Is this ryan being himself again ? I'm in for it !
okay netflix!
Deadpool is a son of Hulk 😛
This🙌🏾
Whoever signed off on this needs to quit their career
So this is what deadpool and hulk spend their me-time
Only because there’s Jennifer Garner, Zoe Saldana and Ryan Reynolds.. in a deconstructed version of Zathura - I know I’m not the only one who has watched Zathura ;)
My initial thought was oh how funny! It's a 13 on 30 reunion with Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo!  Then I saw time travel was involved and I legit had to make sure this was not some  type of crazy sequel
Now I can watch Back to the Future, The Time Traveller's Wife and Star Wars at the same time!
Ok now hulk is Deadpool's father 🤣so what next ?
I literally said 5 seconds in "This kid reminds me of a younger, tiny version of Ryan Reynolds" and then I watched the rest of the trailer 😂  Can't wait for this movie
Amazing 👏
So... The son is the dad and the dad is the son 🙃
Deadpool, Elektra, Bruce Banner and Gamora
This will come out on my birthday, this is the best birthday gift ever! 😭❣️
THE LAST STAR FIGHTER VIBES
13 going 30 part 2?? hahahaha
*IM FUKN IN BABY!!!* 😂 ❤️ 👏   We Got Deadpool, Hulk & Gamora! This Is Gonna Be Gooooood!
Oh my gosh give it up to the casting this looks awesome can't wait,
This looks amazing.
Jenna Rink and Matty’s son is Ryan Reynolds . Must watch this
Gamora, Deadpool and Hulk in Multiverse of Madness
This actually doesn't look half bad for a Netflix movie.
It's like a new version of that Bruce Willis movie, The Kid.
I know that guy at @1:55 on the right LOOOL
I'll pass
Awesome story concept. Cant wait!
I absolutely hate when these movies are released on streaming services. Cause 99%of the time that means no DVD or blue ray release. They remain permanently locked behind 100 different pay walls. You either have to have a crippling streaming bill every month or play Merry go round with your subscriptions. Infuriating.
This is just a “13 Going On 30” sequel but it’s about Jens and Marks kid. That’s it. And I’m all for it😂
TURN TO JESUS CHRIST, THIS WORLD BELONGS TO THE DEVIL.
So why isn’t this in theaters? It looks better than that moon movie.
Nut Sauced. For sure.👏🏽☝🏽💯🎥🎥
"13 going on 30" Part 2 lol
Yo this is give me Zathura kinda vibe! But the most important is reunion of Garner and Ruffalo!
Until we have Deadpool in the MCU with the Avengers, this is probably the next best thing.
I'm getting tired of these sort of films
i write motivational quotes... hope you like
ruffalo mourns a pedo
so hulk is deadpools dad
mark ruffalo donated $50 mil to build a school of the name of convicted child rapist joseph rosenbaum
Seems like Netflix got quite the bump during covid that now they are putting some real money into casts, screenplay and effects to compete with some real major blockbusters. Hope it’s good because most Netflix movies have been desperately mediocre tell recently
this is 2022 yall, that black woman is far too light skinned and also too skinny.🤣
at first, i thought this would be a sequel of 13 going on 30 after seeing jen and mark together LMAO even though it's not, this movie looks fantastic! definitely will watch it once it releases.
March??? Drop it now aaaaaaa
looks wack
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤
It’s like yes i have a mom but are dad is missing see yah mom till next time looks awesome 👏🏻
looks really good
Elektra & Hulk and Deadpool / Green Lantern & Gamora as couples 😂
This looks AWESOME!
deadpool, zamora and the hulk
My Netflix membership keeps paying for itself over, and over, and over
Did Ryan Reynolds sign a deal with Netflix?
The kid reminds me of young Freddie Highmore
Reminds me of Zethura but no game involved
THIS CAST THOUGH!!! I love Jennifer Garner an absolute sweetheart…Mark Ruffalo same goes for him and he is goofy as hell. Then Ryan Reynolds just always bring that Ryan Reynolds I love so much…such a goofball. AND ZOEY!!
The music certainly makes it seem very Spielbergian...
Idk who gave Netflix the audacity to make movies like these but please don't stop. I can't wait 🥶🥶
Looks like an awesome film but Ryan looks nothing like that kid
If you not gonna like this heartwarming science fiction aventure about man traveling time to meet his dad, we are also casting the most likeable actors around.
Deadpool ♥️ Gamora I see, I see.
NOW I NEED TO SEE RYAN REYNOLDS AS A JEDI!
This was the reason extended my netflix for one more month 😂
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
I am here for this!!!
Is this the sequel to 13 Going on 30?
Thank You Netflix I Will Definitely Check This Out!
Zathura?
The 13 Going on 30 sequel finally arrived.
When will Ryan Reynolds stop playing the same funny character over and over again ?
Fking damit has Ryan Reynolds. Lame.
So what I’m hearing is, Deadpool’s Hulks son and teamed up with Gamora in a mashup not only more visually tasteful than Marvel, but clearly better written than marvel. I love the stuff Ryan Reynolds pulls 😂
OMG!!! Netflix you done it again!! 🔥🔥🔥
Wow looks like Ryan Reynolds has almost escapes the type cast characters
So Hulk, wanna make a film together? Said Deadpool Hulk: why not? Gamora: count me in too guys
better casting that mark and tom in uncharted.
Generic si-fi trailer music
I thought this was a 13 going on 30 sequel 💀
From the Director, Star and Producers of Free Guy  -  Ryan's humor in that one sentence
Ryan Reynolds can't miss.
9h after vid uploaded: 3.3M veiws & #16 on trending
This is so a huge amazing film!
i hope it’s woke
WOW AMAZING
Oh so Gamorra, Deadpool and the Hulk Cool
ok if Shawn Levy was able to make a real good movie about videogame in Free Guy, i'll never doubt him again… this guy is mind-blowing, excited to see what he and Ryan together one more time prepared for us!
Soooo... Electra and Hulk had a son who is ... Deadpool and who is dating Gamora. Multivers is so insane
Younger self getting to know older self by timetravel. This is 13 Going on 30 sequel right?
Hulk has his own movie ?
iNSPIRED BY ZATHURA A SPACE ADVENTURE ! XD
Feel like I am watching Marvel movies  LOL 💛 🤣
The heck is Gomorrah and hulk doing there
yes I will watch
The hulk, Deadpool and Elektra all in one
Omg this looks so good!! Lots of nuggets but enough to not give it away ♥️
What a nice 3 minute "teaser"
Yeah right, Deadpool and Gamorra needed a movie together and I didn't knew I need to see it...
It’s the 13 going on 30 reunion for me
Apple
The liberal 🤡s - Real Life Title
So Deadpool‘s father is the Hulk, his mother is Elektra n his girlfriend is Gamora. Would hate to find out who her father is…
Wow this looks really fun!
Hulk, Elektra and Deadpool.
Anybody else thinks this is sequel to 13 Going on 30?
Deadpool, Hulk, Elektra with Gamora? I'm in
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can't wait
I’m hyped
I'm interested to see how the rules of time travel are in this movie.
This looks amaaazing! I love Ryan Reynolds, so I'd watch it either way! ;)
This Green Lantern remake looks promising.
More material for Deadpool to reference.
this looks so exciting
this looks DOPE! and the kid reminds of a young Freddie Highmore
Now I'm waiting for Deadpool to meet Hulk and call him father
This trailer has me stoked for this
So… this is how Jenna and Matt’s future turned out!!! 🤣 also i love how this gives off the same vibes as Zathura: a space adventure.
GAMORA / HULK / DEADPOOL JUNTOS, ME MUERO MUERTO.
Well, I guess Age of Ultron just had an upgrade
Netflix is investing
It’s nice to see a new, original fantasy/sci fi movie that actually looks good. Don’t see those every day.
Live action Meet the Robinsons
boring
Sweetooths home 😭
Mom never get in on the action
Omg Jenifer Garner, Mark Ruffalo, Ryan Reynolds, and Zoe Saldana!!!! IM IN
Looks cool
I can just imagine how much fun Ryan Reynolds had calling Mark Ruffalo 'dad' 😂
Jennifer makes the best onscreen mom!
Getting super 8 vibes from the music alone. Love this
So watching 🤗🤗🤗
Would have been better if this was a TV series 🔥
Hulk with Deadpool... love it
They keep telling us the truth in these movies and tv shows. Time travel is a real thing. Science fiction is really science Non fiction. Everything is backwards to confuse us!
Ryan Reynolds is in the best phase of his career. Can't wait to see him play himself. Love him ❤️
It's great to see Ryan Reynolds in a more serious tone role, already loving the actor playing his younger self. All the cast tho is top-notch and a time travel plot HECK YES. This is totally theater-worthy than just being on Netflix, but definitely excited to watch this. In superhero scenario, we got Deadpool, Gamora, Hulk and Elektra all together lol
The sequel to 13 going on 30 has taken a very interesting turn.
PLEASE NETFLIX on behalf of ALL german speaking netflix subscribers. GET RIT OF ALL YOUR TRANSLATORS! IT'S HORRIBLE. obviously easy and first class kind of translations even fail. this is a crime against language
I have a sneaking suspicion the casting director is a marvel fan. Cant tell why though must be a hunch
snoozefest, Ryan really needs to stop with his cringy "humour", we're not in 2014 anymore.
Bruce Banner, Deadpool, Gamora and Elektra in the same movie? Can't wait to see it
I have no idea what this is
“I miss him too” talk about wooden dialog
When is this out
Wait....  Deadpool, Elektra, Bruce Banner, Gamora....  Is this a new Marvel movie????? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Joke apart, it looks a great and a lot of fun.
I got such ZATHURA feels in the beginning lol
This is giving me Zathura vibes. Can't wait to watch it🥺
Oh, Ryan, you're spoiling me again 😄
In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. Acts 17:30
Jupiter in Pisces 🌊
I'm so happy to see Ryan and mark in a movie together!! This looks really good!!
If you confess Jesus as Lord and believe He was raised from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
OwO (I am a bot and this action was preformed automatically)
This looks great
I think this is what people refer to as "a pleasant surprise". This looks really great, gotta love sci-fi!
13 Going On 30: Into The Future
I didn't know Deadpool was The Hulk son
That lil boy looks nothing like Ryan Reynolds.
Looks good
another one movie for kids... thank you but no
Excelente
This looks terrible
DUDE. FREE GUY IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE. AND WITH THIS TRAILER FROM THE SAME PEOPLE????!!!!????!!!! FUC YES
Deadpool.
Huh, the trailer didn't show Ryan Reynolds make a joke or smartass comment every 2 seconds, still, i challenge any director, writer, producer in Hollywood to make a movie where Ryan Reynolds (and also Dwayne Johnson) don't play as themselves.
PLOT TWIST, RYAN REYNOLDS IS ACTUALLY THE SON OF THE KID PRETENDING TO BE HIS DAD.
Zathura
ELLLLOOOOOO
I definitely.want to check this out when this comes out no cap this movie is gonna be lit🔥🔥 man come on it's ryan Reynolds  and zoe saldana I love her in the guardians of the galaxy movies and etc
oh no its happened! the first movie where Ryan Reynolds looks old
This looks like it should be in theaters
Looks like aids
I cant wait!!!!!!!!!
I had to pause and breathe 20 seconds in coz I saw Jennifer and Mark together againn wtffff my heart 😍😍😍
I'm an extra in this 🙂 I'm so excited to finally see this movie
Ganará un Oscar ya lo verán ❤️
Okay, this will get me back to Netflix. Shipping Garner and Ruffalo. Great chemistry.
Free Guy was really neat, i'll have to watch this.
You dont need to waste money on a trailer- just show the part where it says "from the director and producer of Free Guy" and people will come watch it!
This looks really good, Netflix dropping some gems this year.
Okay, that’s pretty new and unique that as a person falls unconscious from the shock of something that the other character catches them and pulls them right back in for more story. I’m watching this film for sure
Ladies and gentlemen,  today, we Welcome to the future
So your father was a Hulk?
I want to be excited for this because of the casting and effects, but it's SO cheesy. They just don't know how to make kid friendly movies anymore without making them feel like it was made for literal babies.
Shut up and take my subscription!!!
Okay, Daymmm!
This is going to be AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Also, seeing hoverboards always makes me think of Uglies and on the subject of Uglies when will y'all release a trailer for Uglies?
Did you say Time Travel? You know how to please me netflix
It Looks Good. By The Way, What's The Name Of The Music Playing In The Background?
Always wanted a Deadpool/Hulk movie
Ryan Reynold my best actor I can't just wait for this movie.
A bit over the top, but finally a sequel to 13 going on 30 - amirite?!
Hulk being Deadpool’s dad is hilarious.
Ok.. Deadpool, Hulk & Gamora together
That looks absolutely amazing! wow... just... wow!
Every actor in this trailer except for the kid has starred in a Marvel movie before
3 minutes is a teaser? Lol don’t upload the trailer we got enough! I’m sold.
Jennifer Garner is the new Joan Cusak aka onscreen mom.
Y'all are gonna really copy Zathura like this?
I need to know how much Netflix is paying these actors and I need to know now.
😊👏🏾
Casting director: How many Marvel people you want in this movie?    Filmakers: Yes.
Love it already omg!!!!
Pretty bad , but sounds funny so I will watch it
This is legit a new version of zathura
Hulk and Electra have Hal Jordan as their son, and he partners with Gamora. 🤔
So this was the kid who recited the complete opening monologue of deadpool 2 byheart in that video long back 😁
13 going on 30 sequel! finally!
The 13 going on 30 Sequel is taking some unexpected turns.
Did he use his space ship to open a portal for hyper space travel but like within the earth’s atmosphere? Was she using a cinder shot or centinal beam to melt that guy, Was that a make shift light saber?? The hulk is Deadpools dad??? Iam losing my mind here, someone give me this movie now!!!!!
3 minute trailer  *teaser*
1:50 THIS WORLD.... SHALL KNOW PAIN
anything Ryan Reynolds i am watching , i don't care lol
Deadpool meets The Hulk
I’m soooo ready for this
I hate trailers because I have to wait for amazing movies like this😢
NIce Netflix, this should be excellent!
❤❤❤🤩❤❤❤
Could you imagine if this was the same movie but they were there Marvel counterparts..Hulk, Elektra, and Deadpool...that would be amazing. Netflix bringing the fire this year.
This looks cool. I like that lightsaber looking thing he's got.
The cast really tried it nice
Flight of the Navigator, anyone?
This honestly looks great. Shawn Levy directing and Ryan, Mark, Jennifer, Zoe is a pretty special cast. But I don't know why that every Netflix film that I really feel like seeing I always feel would be better in a theater. This is definitely one of those. Its a little strange that the first trailer for this movie has released just a month before its release.
imagine seeing yourself grow up to be Ryan Reynolds
Same look as a marvel movie  Captain marvel x Guardian of the galaxy
This looks pretty good...
I would watch it in a theater. Looks amazing visuals
Am ready
This is one of Netflix's best movies. Wow. Can't wait for more great Netflix movies this year.
Jennifer Garner is now playing 'MOM' roles. Wow. Life it tough in Hollywood as a woman.
wesh wesh ça à l'air lourd <3 jvais grave regarder ça enplus réunion entre Jenna et Matt ahah
Netflix going all out with this movie, I’m so hyped for this movie to come out!
looks a little gay
This trailer has me FEELING the same vibes as I did when I was a kid seeing the trailer for "The Last Starfighter" a looong time ago!!!
Ryan reynolds-Time travel exists! Chad - okay
oh so it's like the live action of Meet the Robinsons, cool
This is Zathura but Ryan Reynolds
wtf is with the music, they just used this in jurassic park trailer
Elektra and Hulk have a kid that looks like Starlord but grows up to be Deadpool and dates Gamora and fights the Xandar police,when he acts like Starlord and Doctor Who
So this is a direct sequel to 13 Going On 30, and I won't let anyone change my headcanon.
I am in
Nobody: Me:😳Sooo the HULKS son is ANTMAN who’s girlfriend is GAMMORA 🤨  Nobody: Me:ITS GREAT TO SEE JENNA RINK& MATT FLEMHAFF HAVE A FAMILY TOGETHER NOW🥰 (The girls that get it get it 🤷🏾‍♀️)
Time Cops
Ruffalo, Garner, fast forward to future.  I’ve seen this movie before.
Man this reminds me of Zathura
So wait wait... I'm guessing he's from another universe ... an alternative Earth in the future where humanity is more advanced than this Earth well that sucks... This movie goes to show us  that technology is moving way too slow... We need breakthroughs people and we need it fast also I'll watch anything with Ryan Reynolds and Jennifer Garner in it... They're amazing actors and of coarse Mark as well
Zoe Saldana? Way to bury the lead.
All these fake comments are weird af lol
This really should be in theatres...
Ryan Reynolds. 🥰 No homo.
looks amazing...
there has to be deadpool and hulk joke in this movie or we boycott it
Ryan Reynolds playing himself in every role smh
God I hate it when school punished the kid you didn't fight back.
Incredible. Wish I could have worked on this film.
Finally, something good to look forward to seeing.
Are we all going to ignore the fact that Netflix hired almost the whole MCU for this movie? Deadpool, Hulk, Gamora and Elektra
Wokeflix show without the woke? Someone must have not received the memo.
cant wait for this. It must be awesome
Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds. Again. Cheers.
Cool!
OK thats look cool and definitely love the cast ! Also now i totally want to see a movie with deadpool and bruce/hulk now !
Hulk, Dr. Banner, Gamora, Deadpool WTFFFF!!
are you kidding me you put hulk , garner , and the guy most probably drunk in gin ,who luckily married to lively .       .....together in a film
I was about to cancel my netflix subscriptioin. But this!!!
Ryan & Mark, two guys from the separate Marvel projects, can’t wait 😁
Netflix 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌴
of course the kid of the couple from 13 going on 30 time travels! itś in the family!
What's this an MCU thing?
Deadpool becomes Darth Maul, teams up with Gamora, his mom is Electra, and his dad is the Hulk? I can't wait.
🔥🔥🔥
Can't wait!
Aailaaa jadooo
I am excited!
Zathura nostalgia 😍
I WANNA WATCH THIS IMMEDIATELY
How do I time travel to March 11?
Holy shit 😦
This is Marvel movie. No one can change my mind.
Holy crap I love this
You guys didn't have to sell me so hard on this.
Hindi Hindi Hindi Hindi Hindi Hindi ❤️❤️❤️👍👍
❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥😍😍🥰🥰🥰💥💯🎉🎊🎊👌👌👌💪💪💪✌️👍👍
The kid’s acting is really good, this looks so fun
After 18 years we get Jenna Rink & Matt Flamhaff back together!!   Wow never realized how Ryan Reynolds’s & Jen Gardner kinda look alike.   This movie looks good!!
Could pass for an 80s action packed movie trailer.
Netflix: here's a trailer  Also Netflix: here's a 3 minute version of the film and it's best bits
for whatever reason i thought about starman looking at this
Deadpool and Hulk ? 🙃
Not gonna lie… this movie looks GREAT!
Uh oh, got some Marvel in this one...
Take my MONEY!!!!
WHAT IF... Hulk and Elektra gave birth to a Young Deadpool... and Future Adult Deadpool hooked up with a Humanoid Gamorrah...?
i love Zathura
Looks like an inventive sci-fi action movie with heart and substance. Really good trailer. This movie could be great. Fingers crossed.
So Hulk is Deadpool's father. Ok.
This looks exciting, I enjoyed the previous collaborations between Reynolds and Netflix,  6 Underground and Red Notice.
A whole generation of film makers inspired by the work of Steven Spielberg! Love it!
Is this the long awaited movie about John Titor?
Awesome ❤️❤️❤️
I remember zathura with this movie
Because its coming
So Deadpool, the son of the Hulk and Elektra, fights through time with Gamora. Cool!
Good, because i dont really have what to watch on NF. More of these kind of movies NETFLIX...pls.
So he played zathura. the kid also looks like the kid from that movuie cant wait this looks sick tho
It looks really bad
I'ma watch the shiiiit out of this movie!
I love how the spaceship uses the same switches as my boat. I feel so futuristic!
More Ryan Reynolds acting like Ryand Reynolds
Deadpool is Hulk's son.....?
Is just me or this sounds a bit like Guardians of The Galaxy with Final Space combined
EPIC Cast !!!! ✨✨✨✨✨✨
This looks sooo coool
so ryan reynolds goes back in time to stop the invention of time travel so Christopher nolan doesnt have to direct a 4 dimensional fight scene and Robert patinson doesn't have to act like he understands it.
Ok i'm hyped.
- Watched the first 5 seconds and knew it was a hit...
This looks surprisingly good.
Dang 🔥 Deadpool,hulk,elektra,and gamora 👀 never saw that coming.....!! Well done Netflix
Wow Ryan Reynolds playing himself in a movie .. *pretends to be shocked*
😮
Deadpool is the son of Hulk and he dates Gamora????!!!!!
So Dead Pool is the son and The Hulk is the Father and Gamora playing the girlfriend of Dead Pool...hmmm...I wonder who will watch the movie...(Inside Me I am Screaming😱🤩)
Holy sh...... DeadPool and Hulk in same movie :D this gonna be epic.
I guess this is why my membership fee has gone up... Again...
So after Jenna and Matt got married and had a son, she passed the ability to time travel to him! This sequel to 13 going on 30 looks awesome!
AMAZING. Full on Cinema film from the comfort of my home.
Netflix!  This is daamn cool!
This must be an official sequel to 13 going on 30
They can't just drop this sweet trailer outta nowhere
koi mil gaya
Gotta tell ya, got me a little misty.
So this means hulk is father of deadpool 😂
This looks amazing! Please tell me it’s coming out in theaters 😱
I have never been more excited to see a netflix original movie more than I am for this one. I cannot wait!!!!
I'm so impressed by the kid! 15 seconds in and I was already sold on him being Ryan Reynolds' younger self; he's got the attitude and humor down perfectly.
What is The Hulk and Deadpool doing together? xD
Something partly original for once!!
Finally a good movie to watch!
Ryan just seem to get so well along with everyone, whether it's his real-life wife, Josh Brolin as Cable and as himself, Taika Watiti in Free Guy, JackSepticEye, Deadpool and even this kid right here.
It would have named it   "Reverse 13 going on 30"  Or  "30 going on 13"  Either or might have worked
This looks so good also the portals shooting from the ships in the end had me thinking of the game Portal for a minute
What the shit? I want to watch right now
Last starfighter meets 13 going on 30 OMFG take my money already wows this looks 🅓🅐🅜🅝 good
I can't help but notice the oddity of having your ex-wife playing the part of your mother. The movie looks awesome though.
Wade Bruce Gamora Hm...
Man, I am hyped!!!🔥
RYAN REYNOLDS!
Yeah ! About see some new time
RYAN REYNOLDS AND JENNIFER GARNER
Is this 13 and going 30 part 2?
Deadpool,hulk,gamora and electra all in one movie...this is gonna be awesome 🤩🤩
What the fu** Deadpool children of hulk😂
I never knew deadpool was hulk's son
When I first read the title it took me back to the series X Files to the episode of the Eve project, then I looked at 53 seconds of the trailer and my mind hasn't swayed from the notion that it is the same concept but in a male version.  We will see how it turns out but so far it seems this way.
Are u really saying that the film won’t be released inTheater but directly on the platform? 😍
JFC I CAN'T WAIT
Deadpool gamora and hulk..
so the hulk is deadpools father?
AAAAAAAAH
I was already interested, but Zoe Saldana being present nails it for me. What a fun cast!
Next Dark is coming 😃
Looks like a good movie can’t wait to watch!
Zathura: A Space Adventure vibe i don't no y
JENNA AND MATTY OMG OMG
Dare Devil, Hulk, Elektra, and Gamora!!! This is the Marvel crossover we’ve been waiting for. 😭🥺
So the rumors about hulk kid in She-Hulk/Hulk 2 is confirmed Deadpool
The Hulk fathered Deadpool. Yes, just yes.
So Deadpool is Hulk's son!!
I cant believe it! Deadpool is really in the mcu now.
Seems inspired by the sub-plot of  Zathura: A Space Adventure. Dax Shepard was revealed to be Josh Hutcherson's older version.
waiting
How is this a “teaser” when the trailer is 3 minutes???
Hot damn this looks incredible, getting ET vibes, star wars and back to the future all at once 😍
I’m so excited
I didnt think i wanted Ryan Reynols and Zoe Saldaña until now?
yeah, whoever did the casting.. know us so well...
13 going 30 in 2022?
My favourite actor 😘Ryan Reynold
I missed Free Guy, at least this we should get to watch in Theaters.
What was that 🙄🤯
Zathura + Star Wars and you have this. I have a feeling it’ll flop though
Like it
Nyama bugima
Trailer song is familiar. Where have I heard it before?
Shawn Levy is so underrated. Welp I guess I am getting Netflix again
This 13 going on 30 sequel looks awesome! Jenna and Matt had a son, and he can time travel like she did
So its Deadpool and the hulk timetravelling this time?
Collins ferrel Ryan Reynolds Jim Carrey star trek dude etc
matty and jenna! awe
Deadpool is the Hulk's son?
Don't air this move I don't imitates coming to me I'm all kind n savior messenger like valerian movie I don't want stuff like that I know when onces upon another
Deadpool, gamora and hulk
Woow excited 🔥🔥🔥. Amazing casting 😍
another banger from Deadpool himself, Ryan Reynolds! Can't wait!
Something new...original...different? Count me in.
Is this the 13 going on 30 sequel I never knew I wanted??!!
I'm convinced. No way I'll watch it. What derivative idiocy. I'm sure they'll all make zillions. Sigh.
Naa
w
😍😍😍😍
Ok so Hulk is Deadpool's dad, Elektra is his mom and Gamora is his girlfriend, right?
I am sure there is no time travel paradox in this movie!
Lame attempt at recreating Zathura: A space adventure
Looks real nice, I'm in.
This trailer, the actors and the type of movie actually makes me think we need a Netflix sub. They did a good job of editing the trailer!!
sooo Hulk is Deadpool's father and his mother is Elektra... Ben Affleck wouldn't be too happy about this
So watching this
Let's go, in and out, 20 minute adventure.
Deadpool is dating Gamora as they search for his dad... the Hulk. I'm okay with this MCU timeline. They should've taken out Kang years ago.
Hulk and deadpool together
Deadpool,  Hulk and Gamora team up finally! oh and Jennifer Garner used to play Elektra in Daredevil but ...euh... _we don't talk about Bruno_
I LOVE that the whole plot wasn’t just spoiled by the trailer. Refreshing. So excited for this!
<Whiners> All they post are old movies, why don't they do something new, why, what, grumble, grumble, ... Netflix: <Ahem> We give you...  Lol. Love it! This looks really fun. This will be a day one watch. I'm going to go buy popcorn today in preparation. Hmm, maybe I need to upgrade my couch blanket... ;-)
Another multerverse version of Deadpool and his dad is Hulk and he is inlove with Gamora.. Why is Gamora?...!
Looks interesting but I'm a little worried about the script - it had FOUR writers! Last 3 writers for rewrites (difference between the use of "and" and "&")
holy big budget!
What in the! This is an awesome new idea! I am stoked about this movie.
this trailer was meant to be played in theaters... literally had the vibe of every adventure/sci-fi/fantasy blockbuster movie that ever came out
I like that he is not just Ryan raynold here
matty and jenna had a son?
Who said that Time travel was for nerds
Deadpool, gamora, hulk.. Okay I'm in....
TBH AB TRAILER TOH NI AAYEGA..KUKI TEASER ZYADA BADA HOGYA
This looks great because it seems like Ryan Reynolds isn't playing Deadpool and the writing is decent.
OMG 😱😳 What can i say cause it's really gonna be fire 🔥🔥🔥
Ah the combination of Deadpool and the The Hulk what else can I ask for/
YES PLS
One word  YES
This looks amazingly cool.
I’m here for it!! And Jen and mark as a couple again. It’s 13 going on 30 !! If there fav candy is razzles in this I may flip
I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet.
a team up between deadpool, elektra, hulk and gamora is the last thing i expected.
IM ONLY HERE FOR JEN AND MARK TOGETHER AGAIN
I hope Ben 10 movie could rrelease too..like this
This reminds me of Zathura shits awesome
Anyone ever see the Channel Chasers special from Fairly OddParents? This remade version looks very good xD
Bruce Banner is Deadpool’s father 😂aww jk
Shit! Another video game movie with pathetic plot and second hand effects.
When you realize that mark Ruffalo ,Jennifer garner and Ryan Reynolds from marvel
If you told me yesterday Matty and Jenna would be parents to Deadpool who dates Gamora, I wouldn't believe it.
Is there anything this man is not in?!
Is there a Ryan Ronald's cinematic universe, I see what's going on.
Elektra, Deadpool and Hulk in a same movie...very odd teamup but still I'll watch the crap out of this movie  Reason: RYAN REYNOLDS!!!!
That looks fun ^_^
I'm stoked to see how well the humor and dynamic of a Ryan Reynolds and Mark Ruffalo father and son will turn out. Very excited!
My god it's awesome
A teaser that’s 3 mins? That’s a long teaser lmao
So you are telling me that the Deadpool is the son of Hulk 🔥🔥
Nice 👍
Deadpool, Hulk and Gamora all together….
Deadpool, Elektra, Hulk and Gamora in one film.. sign me up!!
So basically, Deadpool is the son of Elektra and the Hulk.
You can say that Deadpool calls hulk daddy.
This movie will mark the second collaboration between Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner after starring in 13 Going on 30. I'mma check that movie out.
So Hulk is Deadpool's father in this movie! Okay I'm totally fine with it.
Awe look at all these Marvel Actors. Deadpool,Hulk, Electra, Gamora.
Ryan Reynolds has a lightsaber......name anything more cool...... I'll wait
Hulk and Deadpool together 😎 with a big smash 🔥
that was awesome! amazing 80s sci-fi vibes!
So this is where the Netflix price hike went....
Unpopular opinion here but I'm so over Ryan Reynolds in almost every Netflix movie.
Zethura lookin a lot different than I remember...
All I can think of is Matty and Jenna!! OMG!!!
The Hulk, Deadpool and is that Gamora? In one film?!
So basically, The Last Starfighter 2.0.  I like it.
Great
Clicked on the video fast
Zoe Saldana continues to be an absolute badass
Zuthura vibes. ❤️
I literally recognize this move The Adam Project and I think it’s gonna be a good sci-fi movie of all time
This music is way too epic for such a shitty trailer
This is basically zathura wtf
Wait-  No Deadpool, Hulk, Gamora jokes?
🅰🅼🅰🆉🅸🅽🅶
Can't wait this Masterpiece
Breaking the time travel trope, mark ruffalo and Jennifer garner back together, Ryan Reynolds and Shawn Levy back together again, new child actor. If this was any other director I would be concerned but it’s Shawn levy, so sign me up!
mark ruffalo and jennifer garner on screen again?? a movie about time travel but breaks ALL the rules of time travel?? STARING RYAN REYNOLDS?? say less
2022 version of Back to the Future
Is this not Avengers 5? Deadpool and Hulk!
It's nice for a change to see Ryan Reynolds in a serious movie, in a serious role.
Netflix release the movie in tamil language because everyone watching Netflix in tamilnadu...
You got it folks... The remake of Back to the Future !
I love to see Ryan in time travel movies
Kids are gonna love this movie. Reminds me of Starkid.
When the trailer makes you spell-bound with such a unique concept, u know you are in for a treat. Kudos to the writing team for crafting out such an out of the box sci-fi script.
Why does this feel like a movie that should be in theaters? I felt like I was watching so long-awaited beginning film of a trilogy. Kind of like the feeling I use to get when watching trailers for Hunger Games films or Maze Runner. Makes it anxious for more.
Gorgeous 💥❤
Hulk is Deadpool's Dad...!!! I hope this is Canon 😂
Hulk: Time Travel! 😂
Plzz don't dissapoint me like you know what
vibes of  flight of the navigator, and last starfighter, with a little bit of the explorers.
13 Going On 30 with a Sci -Fi twist.  First it was Amy Adams and Patrick Dempsey reuniting after 15 years for Disenchanted and now it's Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo reunited since 18 years with The Adam Project
So this is what happens after Jenna and Matt get married. Didn't expect this
3 minute teaser... ok. Why not just call it a trailer?^^
Count me in!
Ryan came from the future to tell that kid about the great Mint Mobile deals.
This feels like terminator and I'm here for it
Looks great! Can't wait to see it.
JENNA AND MATT TOGETHER AGAIN 🥲🥲
Oh wow. This looks like so much fun! March 11th here I come! 😄
everyone is excited about ruffalo and reynolds playing father and son. I'm more excited about ruffalo and garner's reunion.😇😇😇😇
that’s how you make a trailer
OMG!!! Ryan Reynolds called Mark Ruffalo, Daddy? Sexyyyyy.... I´m dead.... Oh, sorry. He called him Dad. Still... ¡Those two! Dead...
Gaurdians of the Timeline.
Zathura .... where is Bruce Willis .... ok Zoé I’m on board
hulk and elektra are husband and wife then they make deadpool then he grows up and goes with gamora. WHAT!?
Okay but the first rule of time travel is not to interact with yourself sooooo what’s gonna happen!.?!?!?!?
Ripped off zathura
This looks cringe
13 going 30 sequel.. sort of
Deadpool ... Hulk...Electra ...Gamora... it's this MCU 🙃
Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo back together again! The 13 Going on 30 reunion we all needed
You can take my money. Give teathre  release.
A cast to _____ for & great VFX, can't wait
The effects look really cool, they are “realistic” & yet have a particular sound & visual design! Congrats modelers, animators, look-development team & concept artists!
What kind of Zathura shit is this, I didn't knew hulk was Deadpools father
Deadpool: hi dad! Hulk: *smash *
Big hype
Awesome trailer very entertaining and fun.
13 Going On 30 sequel is not what I was expecting but I like the direction they went. Willl for sure be watching.
Electra, Deadpool, Gamora and Hulk in the same movie? Let's frickin gooooooo
재밌어보이네 과연
So glad to finally watch a trailer for this movie I'm totally going to watch this next month can't wait for it !
This is going to be awesome
Wow!! was waiting for the trailer 🔥🌠💖☺️
Matty and Jenna! 😍
Netflix about to come out the gate swinging this year and I am here for it!
Maanaadu > Adam Project
We found  gamora!!!!! Screw my dad make me Rich 🤑 future me daddy issues 🤣
Ok I’ll make the most obvious joke here  Omg the Incredible Hulk is green lanterns dad that explains why he is green
Deadpool, Hitman's Bodyguard, Free Guy, Red Notice and now this., Reynolds really ruling the Action/Fantasy Genre right now.
Incredible 👍
I would have paid to see this in theaters! Thanks Netflix 😁
what's gGGGESUSaaaahhhhhHAAAAHHHHH
Is Ryan Reynolds a good actor ? I can't tell because he always plays the same character which is himself lol
This will be a very good movie
The New Avengers: Hulk, Deadpool, Gamora, and Elektra.
OMG, wow!
so Hulk has a son Deadpool? what a strange Multiverse
Damn can’t wait
Did Kevin Fiege do the casting for this movie
Those zathura vibes.😭
So Hulk is the father of Deadpool, Electra is his mother. Deadpool travels back in time and meet his younger version and fight alongside with Gamora ? !!!!  Can't wait 😄😄😄.
Who look smart : The Hulk Who is hot in scifi movie : Gamora (No the other in Star Trek..nyota uhura, Yes her!) Who is Popular right now : Ryan Renold  Yeah...let's make a movie with them about time travel
So is this a sequel to 13 going on 30? 🤣😂
❤❤
I’m not screaming. You are.
1:36  1:43 2:36  *The Pauli Exclusion Principle has left the chat*
Don't know why they keep casting Jennifer Garner as every mom in every movie.   Honestly though I would rather watch this movie than watch the new Jurassic World
Ryan🔥
GOSH !!! what a trailer. Just AWESTRUCK....thanks to netflix and the entire crew of the movie for coming up with such a subject on silverscreen. Hollywood movie making is just above all. No doubt about it. Salute to Netflix team for bringing such contents to our homes.
This Reminds me of Dark
Did we need to know that it was future and past? Damn spoiler trailers!!!!
The music is Centrifuge by Audiomachine.🤘😜
So hulk married elektra and gave birth to deadpool who later dated gamora and watched looper together to go back and meet himself.
Is Jennifer Garner gonna kick ass in this cause that is gonna be a waste of talent… and I just realized that four members of the cast played Marvel Characters, two of which are not yet in the MCU
Woah 😍 that's was awesome ❤️
Hulk and Elektra had a son.  He is Deadpool.  Wonderful
If I was a 12(ish) year old kid who got to meet my future self and found out I would grow up to be Ryan Reynolds... I'd definitely have one hell of a confidence boost.
Why I cry tho😭 Damnit I can't wait
This film looks great.
OMG I CAN'T WAIT!!❤😍❤😍!!
Deadpool, Hulk, Neytiri and some random kid! Sold!
That was awesome 💥
Technically you could call it 13 Going On 30 and it would still make sense in more than one way
So hulk and elekra had a son who grows up to be deadpool.. cool
*THIS ISN'T A TEASER. IT'S THE ENTIRE MOVIE.*
Выглядит круто и интересно! Буду ждать ;)
No one's talking about Zoe Saldana smh great actresses
Carmen Cuba, you're a genius.
😍😍😍
💥💥💥💥
People are way too easy to please. Sheesh.
Hulk and deadpool in another universe
🤯
This looks fantastic! See Hollywood? It's not that hard to come with original and fun ideas when you put good effort into it!
Excited! 🤯
Netflix a Ben ten movie please 🥺 👉🏻👈🏻
so Deadpool is the son of the Hulk and Elektra in this multiverse? Got it
This looks wonderful!
AWESOME!!!!!
Just when I think Netsux can't get any worse for the already deficient-minded. Enjoy your HappyPlace!
Can Always count on Ryan Reynolds to bring us another good movie.
This has serious Green Lantern vibes or am I crazy 🙈
Yes, i would definitely watch that
looking forward to this
Ryan Reynolds with discount lightsaber? Im in.
😳 🤯 I…but…the cast…what…when *faints*
g lock
Osm cast directed movie
why are they always dress up the kids all wrong, standard cheap gymp shoes  instead of new or in that time period air max or other sneakers that kids actually wears. so stuppit boys like sneakers not some flat cheap of riubber thats from the 70's or 80's
This movie looks pretty great and a lot of fun. 😊
This isn't how I imagined Hulk and Deadpool would team up. Looks great, though.
1 hrs
So this is what happen after 13 Going On 30 ended
Matty and Jenna💖
This looks really good. Great casting.
That actually looks awesome. How cool that it comes out only a month from now.
Brutal.
No ones gonna talk about Ryan Reynolds being with MCU main casts with his current movies but still not in MCU??!! COME ON!!!!
Deadpool is the son of Hulk 😎😎😂🤑😜
"from the makers of free guy"  hmm lemme take a gander  *a wildryan reynold appears*  gasp, color me surprise.   on a serious not since ryan's been working with a lot of mcu cast ,   that has to be  some kind of subliminal message (lowkey tease?)  that he'll appear in the mcu XD  wishful thinking  i guess. but 1 has to wonder...What If?
Amazing trailer and from the looks of it movie!
finally ryan reynold not acting as himself lol
Why is everything Ryan is in rooted in sarcasm?
😂😂😂 where you going ....got me 😂
Hulk and Deadpool.. what a combo🤩🤩
This movie available in hindi dubbed
Ryan Reynolds will slay in The Adam Project!
Jenifer and Mrk reunited!!!!! omg my childhood
Looks like another trash film where Ryan Reynold's is playing Ryan Reynold's.
danggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
I'm trying (with mixed results) to temper my excitement but this looks Magaical.  This is reminding me of Tomorrowland in fact. Which IS Magical.
Just got the chills. That hasn't happened in forever when just watching a teaser.
Wouldn't have minded two siblings, then it would have given me 90's Jumanji vibes.
These are peak years for Ryan Reynolds, being Deadpool did sky rocketed his career.
Flight of the Navigator + Zathura?
Was that gamora ?at @2:20
That what I want to watch
The sequel to 13 going on 30 looks insane!
Is this coming in Hindi? My dad's a great Space Fan! Would watch with him if it does.
Trailer gave me chills! This is so dope
Zoe Saldana in spaceships again.. hmm sounds familiar
Multiverse films shit everywhere all at once.
This is awesome!!!💜👍
WOW!!! Netflix this looks amazing!!! 😍🤩🤩
i hope deadpool reacts on this trailer with the hulk and gamora, just like what they did in free guy.
*G* eeeeeee S
there is your price increase justification
too bad that pedo lover ruffalo is in it
This looks awesom
dude netflix is bringing the fire! take all my money! TYVM!
Can y’all just bring back an OG series plz
So Deadpool loves Gamora and is secretly Hulk and Elektra's son!
“Where u goin”😹👏🏽
Awesome
brooo this looks soo good!
This is a trailer not a teaser
One of the best thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he archives We congratulate overselves on this achievement Something He always respect us, the audience and his team and he is polite in all his videos more to come
This teaser was awesome. Good to see Jennifer Garner.
13 going on 30 sequel????????????
Shame they casted the anti-freedom America hating douchebag Mark Ruffalo. Gonna have to pass on this one.
"yesterday is History "Tomorrow is Mystery "Today is gift" "That'why it's called persent
Hulk's son Deadpool 🤣🤣
Can any1 explain to me why they think Ryan can play a straight character it’s like watching dax shepard have HXC sex on camera I mean he could but I don’t wanna see it it just ruins the whole movie when Ryan trys to be anything more than a comedian he just can’t pull it off
Just ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Really awesome 👍😎
This is a weird spin-off of 13 Going 30
Looks like an MCU reunion
Mark Ruffalo as Ryan Reynolds dad? Wow. Why am I fapping...
The cast is gold ❤️ and I am numb 💯😭
Looks great
So Hulk, Deadpool and Gamora are together in a movie! This is something I need to watch.
Elektra, Hulk, Gamora and Deapool
Loved free guy sure gonna love it too.
Jenna and Matty!!
At least netflix are coming up with new ideas instead of reboots and remakes or live actions
Oh yes, deadpool's parents are the hulk and elektra, and his working with gamora, they are going to space.   Peter Parker:  the multiverse is REAL?
The cast and the effects are getting me hyped. Also I discovered 13 Going On 30 during lockdown two years ago. Good to see Jen and Mark together again
It's really reminds me Zathura ,  will be great !
So deadpool, the hulk, elekatra and gamora walk into a bar.
Looks Fun
i'm watching this
My Jenna and Maddy ❤️😍 I love them together 🥺🥺 Apple of my eyes finally coming together after years ❤️❤️
Are y’all sure this ain’t 13 going on 30
Netflix is the new Hollywood i swear!
3 min “teaser”
Another childish movie. Hollywood sucks nowaday
Another time travel movie that I will *eat up*
Writer "So we're going to making a movie about daddy issues"  Producer "Ok, just throw some robots and Ryan Reynolds in it and we're set".
I’m only watching this for the 13 going on 30 reunion tbh
I’m getting a sense Ryan Reynolds REALLY wants to be in Star Wars first Free Guy with the lightsaber now this with the errr light stick
Dang the kid actually looks similar to Ryan Reynolds
A movie with Deadpool,Gamora & The Hulk😂
Please release hindi dubbed
This actually looks good. Looking forward to it.
So Deadpool, Elektra, Hulk and Gamora in the same movie ?  Sign me up
I can't be the only one thinking that the background score is that of Marvel right
is this releasing with hindi languade also
So Deadpool is Electra and Hulks son in this timeline! what have you done Barry?
Hulk: Deadpool??? 🤯 Deadpool: Hi Daddddy 😍😍😍
Oh that looks good.
So it's basically Deadpool trying to save Hulk and Elektra and also joining them is Gamora after endgame multiverse exists 🙂
Is there a sci-fi movie that actually doesn't have the spectacular and beauty Zoe Saldana?
Loooks great!! Can’t wait
A 3 minute teaser and it still managed to look boring. Whoever edits the trailers for Netflix needs to be fired.
Imagine knowing you’re gonna grow up to be Ryan Reynolds
WHY IS NO ONE EXCITED FROM MARK RUFFALO AND JENNIFER GARNER??????
Are You Telling me  that's The Hulk, Dead Pool and  Gamora are in one Movie I'M IN!!
THEYRE BACK TOGETHER
Deadpool,Gamora & Hulk  Thanos: Intresting
meh
This movie reminds me of the 90s type of movies for some reason. That is a good thing
First time in his career Ryan Reynolds is not in his real life character.
So hulk is the father of deadpool... Hmm, interesting
So it's a "serious modern" take on Zathura... Ok.  Oh and way to spoil the big surprise mid-way through the trailer. Lemme guess, they "save the universe" at the end of the film... I'll put this one in my "maybe" folder for when I hit a dry spell.
"Mum! dad! can't you believe it. That's me from the future" "Yeah, time travel run in our family a lot, son"
please ryan dont act like ryan in this one please 🙏
Where's The Grey Man?..
I’m so excited
I’m so hyped for this!!
Deadpool, Hulk, Gamora and Elektra in one movie
THIS LOOKS AMAZING SUPER PUMPED FOR IT
It's like time traveling movie 🙄🙄🙄
By now I'm convinced Ryan Reynolds doesn't need to act for every role he's in.
Ryan in a serious role? This gonna suck.
This looks absolutely wonderful! What an amazing cast. ❤️
This reminds me of that one movie Zathura: A Space Adventure
I’ve been over Ryan Reynolds for years 😒
Looks SO good! ❤️
Wow, Gamora, Deadpool and Hulk in the same movie? I'm sold
That was 3 minutes, and that was the official teaser…
Yessss!!!
Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds..😊
DBS Zamasu Saga Adult Trunks meets kid trunks
Bring it on Netflix. We are waiting
I loved ❤️❤️
That was awesome
Matty and jenna
I wasn’t sure when I heard the idea for the movie after the trailer
Is this the sequel to 13 going on 30?
Well, that looks like a fun ride! And the kid is adorable!
the amount of excitement this trailer gave me is unreal
okay, reynolds aside Let's talk about the *13 Going on 30 Lead Actors Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo* for a sec 😍😍😍😍
Nobita time travel without Doraemon... 😅
mark and ryan!!!
holy shi*
Can't wait ☺️
i think my girlfriends going to dump me again over ryan reynolds. he keeps turning our heads
Going to be amazing 🔥
MATTY AND JENNA!
Wow, dude! Jurassic World Dominion and The Adam Project on the same day!!! Talk about a treat!
Looks sooooo good I’m so stoked
You mean for $18 and change a month I can watch this, at home, with my family! What a deal.
Actor: Hi, I'm here to audition for The Adam Project Casting director: Have you played a Marvel superhero before? Actor: Um ...no? Why is that relevant? Casting director: Next!
Ok Netflix 👌🏼
My favorite Ryan Reynolds and I also I like mark ruffelo  Can't wait to watch this movie 🔥🔥
Woah this actually looks promising! What a great cast!
CELEBRATE NON-REMAKE NEW MOVIE IDEAS.
Hulk,Deadpool,ghmora 😱😱
this looks so damn epic, Can't wait for the 11th of March.
😱😱
Can't wait!!!!
think I saw whole movie in TEASER
Wow! This definitely doesn't look like a Netflix movie!
HOORAY for RYAN REYNOLDS fans  😍♥
Ummm ……Jenna and Matt had a kid !
Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo back together! ❤️
So a sci-fi sequel to 13 Going On 30, got it !
The cast 😍😍 can’t wait to watch this!
where are you going 😆
Netflix is really investing money these days...I love it
Wow from 13 going on 30?? 🥰
Awesomeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!
Love how Hollywood is dying and now the streaming services provide ll our movies.
MARK RUFFALO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am in ! For ryan😃
Looks like Marvel basic bull crap
Ruffalo and Ryan is an unexpected pair but i love it😁
Nice
Anything with Ryan Reynolds is a win for me
Let me guess, they find out he's the reason his dad's gone?
Promote the last kingdom you pig headed weasels
😍😍😍
Now that is a movie worth watching ❤
I'm sure this is another Marvel movie without the characters wearing any customes
You had me at Ryan Reynolds.
Nice
Deadpool, Hulk, Electra and Gamora? Sounds like a plan!
I FOR THE FIFTH F***ING TIME. STOP SHOWING THE ENTIRE MOVIE IN YOUR TRAILERS.!!
😂 holy sh*** I love it so much .
NETFLIX iss just awesome
Sci-Fi, Action, Adventure and Comedy. Alright I’m in. Reynolds looks like he is doing a serious role and the young dude is going to shine in this film for sure
Deadpool and Hulk in a Parallel Universe❣
she seriously said "you need to think about your future" to a kid
Me after watching the Trailer 2:23
This looks promising. Then I google this movie, the director was Shawn Levy. I must watch this.
A long time after 13 going to 30 Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner  Deadpool and Gamora that's Awesome
ryan reynolds has been owning the past few years so damn hard. what a beast.
NICE!! Guess what?? I'm super excited now to watch this movie! Feels like this movie gonna be awesome!
Amazing!! I seem to see Hulk and Deadpool
Woa, Blockbusters, nice Netflix, but, the entire movie spolied in the Trailer, bruh.
looks 5.5/10 movie but ok
It's about time travel but looks and feels so original! Free Guy was a blast, can't wait for this!
Free guy director 🤩🤩
This looks like it has potential. Big budget original movie with a great cast? I’m in. Wait, it’s a Netflix big budget movie with a great cast? I’m out.
The Society season 2 :) I have never met my father so waiting isn't a problem for me Netflix :) I will always wait for Grizz, Sam and the others. Love u netflix :)
Movie ka Nam
This movie looks good..
Looks like a really cool sci-fi family movie.
I can't believe Mark and Jennifer again
Jonathan Tropper wrote Banshee and Warrior too, he killed it there, hope he does the same here.
Zathura much?
This teaser was enough. No need for the trailer imo😂. Save some stuff only classified to movie!
I cannot wait !
Hype is real!!!!!
Damn that score is amazing! Gave me goosebumps 😵😵
For a second, I thought Deadpool was gonna steal Hulk's son here.
no hard feeling but this looks cringe
bassically peter quill and yondu from the other universe
If someone's was watching this in 2022 they're a true legend.
Thank God they pull a Gemini Man lol.
Bruce Banner is the dad of Deadpool and DP is dating Gamora, nice
ngl deadpool calling hulk dad feels like something that would be in a deadpool movie
We are talking about time travel here, it's either all a big joke or none of it is..
Wow!! This looks awesome.
That was awesome 🔥
Awesome trailer
Etherlogic ..
yay on netflix!
wow it feels like fantasy family movie from the 80s-90s vibe and I love it
This movie looks fantastic! But I see Netflix is really trying to make that price increase worth it 🤣
wow amazing the best trailer ever !!!!!!!
Perfect trailer. Beautiful casting and mind-blowing VFX. Ryan Reynolds and Mark Ruffalo are in the same movie. Wow!
One of the best thing about Ryan is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something. He always respect us the audience and his team and he is always polite in all of his video we congregate ourselves on this achievement. More to come
Sadly it is another stupid Netflix movie. I wish they will make a good big budget movie for once.
You can't tell me this wasn't inspired by Zathura BUT HOLY SHI-
So basically Deadpool, Hulk, Elektra and Gamora in one movie 😅
from free guy producer 😭
wish this movie had come out when i was little damn! now that i actually know stuff my mind doesnt really get blown away--or excited
wow
This deserves to be seen in theatres
will watch, only if Green Lantern like my comment...ok...i will watch it anyway..😅
So what is this ? Avenger 4 😂
Shawn Levy and Ryan Reynolds together again👏🏽
Bully maguire just know that deadpool's father is hulk Bully maguire says "ohh dr banner. How r u? 😏
A kid who isn't dumb and doesn't need too much story exposition? Wow that's rare
The teaser of this and jurassic world dominion dropped almost the same time
Boring
🥰😍
😍🔥
🔥😍🥰
😍😍🥰
🥰🥰😍
🥰🔥
😍🔥
Only true marvel fan will think of 13 going 30. As for me l, i say like bully maguire "u cant do that huh"😎
🥰🥰
😍😍
🔥😍🥰
Hulk Electra Gamora and Deadpool? IM IN!!!😤😤😤
First of all, the same matter cannot occupy the same space. If you go back in time, do NOT come into contact with yourself! That would be VERY bad! 2nd, it's not a good idea to open a Wormhole/Blackhole/ Quantum Singularity within the Earth's atmosphere. The Gravity Well it creates would tear the Earth apart.
Peak
Deadpool and Hulk
imagine seeing ur future gf is zoe saldana
wow lol
Holy shit deadpool's parents are hulk and elektra🤯
Amazing
this looks sick
This is really amazing lineup and the way they portrayed this new phase is so unique and creative. Definitely psyched.
All I can think of is that video that Ryan posted of the kid doing the whole Deadpool 2 monologue opening lmao
**After hearing Ryan's pitch for the film**  Mark: "So, basically....you call me 'Daddy' the whole time?"   Ryan: "Well not exac..."   Mark: "I'm in"
Somewhere Doc Brown is screaming about consequences of creating a time paradox because of interacting with your younger self right now.
telling me they got deadpool,gomora,hulk and elektra inone goddamn movie 😭😭😭
I CAN´T WAIT!!!
Odd direction for the sequel to 13 going 30
Finalyyyy
ryan reynolds being ryan reynolds is still good
Zathura vibes
🤣🤣🤣
Yeah, I can’t buy Mark Ruffalo being Ryan Reynolds father
mashing the Like button
And I just cancelled, great.
Hulk married to Electra, had Deadpool who falls for (?) Gamora.
Critics r praising this movie.. n moreover when u have reynolds n shawn levy directing..u know its going to be awsome.🔥
No one wanna talk about Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner back on screen together 😍😍 My heart!
give this man every award urghh ryan reynoldssssssss <3
Hulk, Electro, Deadpool and Gamora are in the same movie.
first kenyan
RYAN REYNOLDS AND MARK RUFFALO PLAYING FATHER AND SON?! SCREAMING!!!💥
This isn’t how I remember Back to the Future
Hulk+gamora+Deadpool 🔥🔥
Hey, I just realized, its like Meet the Robinsons.
A movie breaking the most common Hollywood trope about time travel, not interacting with your younger self… starring Deadpool, say less…  Update: saying this movie breaks this common trope doesn’t mean it wasn’t done multiple times before already, stop telling all the movies and tv shows that’s done it differently, i know that.
hulk and deadpool and gamora  team up again
ONE DAY I WILL BE THE BIGGEST ASIAN ARTIST EVER 🇰🇷💃🏽😈🚀
