These government officials take relief moneys to make there pockets stronger it seems allegedly
Reporter being outside be like: "I HATE MY JOB"
¿    Y POR QUÉ LIMA ESTÁ TAN TRANQUILA    ? ?
There are floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc in the mainland and all over the world. Puerto Rico will survive! Dealing with freeloader illegal aliens along the coasts is a harder situation and the inept governor of the island is not able to deal with it by sending them back to their place of origin if it is proven that they do not contribute with anything but being a public burden.
🇵🇷🏝️🎯🌀🙏
That bridge should be higher or any current or future flood or flow of storm water will push or destroy it. I am surprised it wasn't done before. Hope all will be ok in PR.
great reporting God blessPUERTO RICO
It was hella windy on sunday
My lil sis her name is Fiona i feel so bad for everyone there
Can't blame Trump this time lol
The electric service in Puerto Rico is poor, because half of the Puerto Ricans there live in poverty. If Puerto Rico were not a United States (US) colony, she would have a first rate electrical system.  The US militarily invaded Puerto Rico in 1898 to make her a US colony. In 1945, the US refused to comply with the United Nations’ (UN) Charter that prohibits colonialism for being a crime against humanity. Moreover, the US has ignored 41 UN resolutions asking her to immediately return Puerto Rico’s sovereignty to the Puerto Ricans. The US has never defended democracy. She has only used that word to defend only the interests of her 1% of citizens. That has meant 124 years of US colonialism for Puerto Ricans! If the relationship between the US and Puerto is so good for Puerto Ricans, why do two thirds of us live away from our national territory? Why must Puerto Ricans abandon Puerto Rico to supposedly “enjoy all of the benefits” of having US citizenship? Could it be that it was designed that way to get Puerto Ricans out of Puerto Rico? Why should Puerto Ricans be the only ones in the world without our own citizenship? The 9 million Boricuas worldwide must wake up and organize ourselves to engage in permanent resistance to force the US to comply with international law. Puerto Ricans need not be poor in Puerto Rico.
Praying most got out and more got rescued then lost
Can't blame man for this. End times prophecy is coming to fruition. Extreme weather will become more frequent and more intense.
MedMen stock Moving up Today!! California Governor just signed Historical Marijuana Bill. Guess who benefits MOST?  BUY MedMen stock today!! MMNFF

Taino people survived it for centuries, so try being real boriqua, or ask Trump for donations… Goodluck island 🏝
And of course they will just rebuild and wait for the next one. smh

Pray for your communist God, AOC, she will save you! And she loves you all! Is Joe Biden there with you? Take comfort in him! Your cousin Barrack Hussien, will never hand you anything but lies!
How many deaths?

Damn Puerto Rico can't catch a break sheesh hurricane after hurricane. Something ain't right over there
Biden . Send more money to Ukraine 🇺🇦
😩 Brutal
Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.  They tie up heavy cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long; they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues; they love to be greeted with respect in the marketplaces and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by others.  But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all brothers. And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, and he is in heaven. Nor are you to be called instructors, for you have one Instructor, the Messiah. The greatest among you will be your servant. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted".  YOU SHALL NOT MAKE FOR YOURSELF AN IMAGE in the form of anything, in Heaven above or in the Earth beneath, or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them, or worship them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents, up to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me, and keep my commandments.  If my people who are called by my name, humble themselves and pray, AND TURN FROM THEIR WICKED WAYS, I will hear from Heaven, will forgive their sins, and will heal their land.  AND WHEN YOU PRAY DO NOT BE LIKE THE HYPOCRITES, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. BUT WHEN YOU PRAY, GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door, and pray to your Father who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need, before you ask him.  This, then, is how you should pray:  Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.  For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.  "Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway", we can use google search. These are the teachings, The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God. REPENT, and start doing what is right. If you abide my teachings, you are really my disciples; then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.  Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in Truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. GOD IS SPIRIT, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in Truth.  In the New Heaven and the New Earth, only Righteousness dwells. May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with you all.
Heavenly Father God protect your children that are in that hurricane 🙏😇🕊️🌏
So devastating to here. Hoping for the best for the ppl and the island of Puerto Rico 🇵🇷
Let us pray continiously for the people of Puerto Rico. May God have mercy upon these nice people. Puerto Rico was a Tower of strength for the people of the British Virgin Islands in 2017.. We love them. We appreciate them and we are praying for them. God is in control...
Shrek.
Damn that Biden administration... hurting these people
🙏🏽
...🙏
Half of them are still in the dark from the last one. Remember how we sent them all that money to fix it and the people in charge decided that hiring their brothers and cousins for millions of dollars was a much better plan than finding any real electricians?
Man playing with weather with the same results.
I pray all my family who live there are safe 😢
No Se Ingles solo entendí Al residents 😓
Disasters like this or the recent Typhoon in Japan highlight the value of modular nuclear. Such power sources are mobile and can be moved to secure and convenient locations... That way power outages can be prevented or power can be restored more quickly.
God bless those folks. After going through Katrina, I wonder why we move back to areas that constantly get hit by hurricanes 🤦🏿‍♂️
I pray God guidance upon you all. 🇧🇸🙏🙏
Wish things get better soon 🙏🏾
Puerto Rico è a pochi chilometri da New york
Gaby Acevedo has a fucked up looking arm like why you got a line in your arm that ain’t right
Are the MEDIA companies driving the mass collection of funds yet?  Puerto Rico, will hardly get any of it.
Nobody cares about Joe Biden 😂
Lord have mercy on Puerto Rico and It's population.
I pray everyone will recover quickly!
Definitely has something to do with Trump
Rabbi Allahoma ahfid Muslim WA mousslimat WA mouminin WA Al mouminat Fi 3alam koloh Amin Yarabiallamin inshallah beidnillah!
The first time we had a flood was 55" of rain, hurricanes are no joke.

God be with these people. Keep them safe. And bring an end to there misery.
RED WAVE 2024. America first agenda. Vote out lying dems.
What category  is hurricane  Fiona?
Who gives a sh¡t about actual people actually suffering?! A rich old lady died across the ocean!!!
I bought  a $100,000 electric vehicle to stop this shyte.....lol.hahaha. lol.hahaha
Habla español mi hermano que estamos en Puerto Rico
When do they take care of Puerto Rico? They have ignored them for years, it's time to send them help!
Man, what did Shrek do to make her that angry?
Puerto Rico more prepared this time?  Is  infrastructure money still being pilfered by local officials? Are they gonna blame Biden for slow response? Has aid money been recovered that was stolen from the last hurricane ? Are their residents still piss poor from their democrats ?
God please protect the people of Puerto Rico 🇵🇷🙏🏽
Who cares. That island has nothing to offer to the mainland.
We the people of the island were not ready we have been experiencing power outages on a weekly basis since Maria still thanks to the inept and corruptness of the federal funds that should be going towards fixing our Island! Where is all those monies going to? Into the pockets of the rich demon rats just like Biden our governor is slowly but surely destroying what's left of the island
The governor is inept and corrupt we are still recuperating from Hurricane Maria no thanks to him stealing all federal funds for CRT gender ideology and free abortions but our island is falling into pieces and he does not care while he is sitting in his mansion doing nothing but filling his pockets!
Hey let's rebuild this bridge. You think we should give it an arch? ....Nah.
Keep safe and confident everything will be restored to normal even the bridge and power.
Dang this place doesn’t get a break does it
Puerto Rico ya Dios se canso de protegerla por tanta sangre que sesta de ramonda en nuestra isla antes estás cosas no pasaban ahora hay temblor y todos los uracanes no sedesvian si no que coje la isla completa
poor puerto rico they don't deserve this shit california does
Time to send billions in aids so the Demoncrats can get their cut. Never let a disaster go to waste.
The difference between me and all of u is u can't scare me. U can't intimidate me. U  can't make me worry about anything at all. Only cowards get scared.  I'm the line between insanity and reality 🎭
😱OMG😳
Save me Jesus!! Save me Jesus!! Jesus I believe in you!! Jesus forgive me of all my sins!!!!
Jesus Christ Can Save You! Repent & Believe The Gospel! Eternal Life Is A Free Gift! Hell is Real!
I don’t who built that bridge but it should have been more arched so flood waters wouldn’t crest it to carry it away.
Prayers to Puerto Rico 🇵🇷
My god 😢my family right now is in guayanilla no electricity, no food just eggs and they are on top of the mountain and the river came all the way up and all bridges are broken 😢 so scary
Пусть всё будет хорошо! 🇷🇺
And guess what? They will build the same bridge with the same parameters...  Insane way of thinking.  Lol smfh
The problem with the power grid has been going on for a while but since Maria the islands Governors have elected to bring in an outside country to fix the electrical grid. Unfortunately all that has done is caused more blackouts without hurricanes or storms. And these companies charges hundreds of millions of dollars to administer the power grid. Luma energy has not been able to resolve the problem.
The problem is that the production and distribution of light on the island has not improved Maria had gusts of up to 225 miles an hour according to the Coast Guard. The storm passed us as a tropical storm and became a hurricane when it crossed the small island of Mona between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. This is disgusting that things are not resolved and they pay hundreds of millions of dollars to a company that has not been able to get a hold of the electric problem here.
In 20yrs you ppl will have your electricity back nothing to worry about!
I visited Puerto Rico after hurricane Harvey/Irma hit and where we traveled was a lot of devastation it was about a month and a half after the hurricane and power was still very scarce even at the airport. At this point I really believe they should start Relocating powerlines underground to try to illuminate electrical issues from trees and severe storms
watch thiss they will blame trump on this
Omg save Puerto Rico 🌞😢
That exains my voice
I think its a sign to get the heck off the island permanently 🤔
Dios ponga su mano y pare esa tormenta. Bendiciones  p. R
🙏🙏🙏🙏
I bet the people of Puerto Rico feel fortunate we haven't gone completely Green with electric vehicles.  Emergency vehicles would be stranded right now.  Go Brandon!
What a horrible way to live where hurricanes hit on a regular basis. God, help this situation.
🌏🐉👈🔫!
Praying for all
The winds are waaaaaayyyyy less than Maria was.
Yet somehow this news crew has live feeds while the whole country has no power, go figure.
Prayers for 🇵🇷🙏🏽
If Puerto Rico can't handle a hurricane one, nothing should be repaired unless it can withstand higher level storms, everything repaired after Maria should have been done expecting a high level storm.  If a category 1 can cut off power for the entire island, repairs were not done right, if repaired bridges can be destroyed by a category 1, repairs were not done right.  Trees need to be trimmed near electrical lines, bridges need to be higher and reinforced, and the electrical infrastructure needs to be designed for preventing entire island loss of electricity.
Hello from Boqueron P.R 🇵🇷It's sad 😔  don't stop the showers and winds  S0S
Sending prayers to puerto rico 🙏 !
Arrepientete y conviertete 🙏
Some comments herr are truly hate speech. Unbelievable.
DIOS PROTEJE MI ISLA Y FAMILIA😫🙌😢🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷♥️♥️♥️
I cannot believe he drove through that for this story. There should be a limit to these newsreporters putting themselves in danger for a story.
Esto es todo hecho con Harbor que Dios tenga misericordia de estos todos
corruption caused this. the infrastructure should've been fixed years ago after the last major hurricane.
Be well, Puerto Rico.    Latinx (what is the "x" about?!!!!  - ugh....) ate very dramatic, both for the good and bad.
its 3:30 am monday here in mayaguez and its still super strong winds and tons of rain.
This is terrible 😞  yet again and they have not even  recovered from Maria yet.. Prayers and well wishes to PR. At least now we don't have Trump throwing paper towels and sending yuky  army squash food.
God isn't someone to be used wherever destruction arises. You praise God during the good and bad. Once the storm is over, all of a sudden God isn't needed. Don't play with my lord and savior. You're either with him all the way or you're not.
God is in control! 🙏🏽in Jesus Name
God, country and freedom🇩🇴, but our prayers are in PR right now🙏🏾sending Many prayers N to wishes to everyone there✔️
We have electric power!!
Please papa protect 🇵🇷
They had 5 years to prepare for this mild category 1 hurricane. Looks like all the billions in aid were swindled by the Democratic party politicians and their crony voters.
上帝垂愛~因乾旱~北.西.東三個水龍捲.災害不多.可惜南北極沒下雪
Sorry. Billions gone to Ukraine.
Let's see if the Democrat politicians steal all the aid money and donations again!
Hurricanes can kill! JESUS SAVES!
I hope this time around they get real help and not paper towels thrown at them.
Wow
YAY,  More debt and begging fom teh third world who insult our people and take from our cities.  WEEEE.
So the whole island can now come to MARTHA'S  VINEYARD now and move to Lightfoots  Chicago too! with your tax money.
I live in Puerto Rico,  believe me is a nightmare,  maria again
My ex wife and kids were there a few weeks ago for there Birthday!! Yall be safe please 🙏
FIRST OF ALL ❤️🇺🇸🙏 I LOVE PUERTO RICO I HAVE NEVER HAVE BEEN THERE AND I MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO VISIT PUERTO RICO 🙏🇺🇸❤️  🙏🇺🇸🇵🇷I PRAY THAT GOD ALL ALMIGHTY WILL SHOW HIS MIGHTY WORKS AND COMPASSION ON THE THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO 🇵🇷🙏.
The problem is people always send "prayers" but it wont mean nothing unless they are actually on their knees praying.
Cuanto mas😢 God protect them all esp the elderly in the mountains 🙏🏻🇵🇷🇺🇸
How are the electric vehicles doing there with no electrical power .
The island are only good for vacation not to live in them.
My grandfather is... was from Ponce. My family still has been unable to find his body since hurricane 🌀 Maria. 😢
Mother nature isn't known to be sympathetic and isn't shown to be sorry of her actions.
Lord Haiti's in your hands!
Thumbs up to the reporter in Puerto Rico.Very informative.

Puerto Rico is becoming like Haiti, can't catch a break.
BLESS OUR  DEAR PUERTO RICO , DEAR LORD.
Ah it’s not that bad
The real story is: why is your name "Gaby"
This should not be happening in America only five after the last disaster!
Sending prayers to Puerto Rico. 🏝❤🙏
Oh wow! This is so sad!
WOW... It's scary enough watching this on TV, but I can't imagine how Mr. Acevedo can be so cool while filming this tragedy during the danger. Thank you for bringing us this awful story, and I pray our Great Creator takes care of the people of Puerto Rico and keeps them safe~
Who gives a shit about Puerto Rico,  laziest crooked people.
Scary I travelled here years ago amazing place amazing people.  Stay Strong ....

Love and prayers for the brave, beautiful people of PR. 🌹❤💕
Prayers up
Thanks to President Biden is helping Puerto Rico hurricane disaster.
NBC is shit.
Immediate response is required, immediately. Let it not be the gross neglect following Hurricane Maria, by FEMA, scandalous, tragic, heart wrenching. Thousands died while 45, ready to trade Puerto Rico, for Greenland? threw Paper towels, and thousands died from gross neglect, while disaster capitalists became millionaires over- night. Colonial politics stinks.
Am praying  🙏 for Puerto Rico 🇵🇷
😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇
God bless my Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 and my good people of Puerto Rico 🇵🇷 🙏amen 🙏
May our Lord protect them 🙏
Gaby Acevedo is the best 💯
I remember having a great Time in San Juan on my last Visit …We just hade returned back Home …when Maria hit Porto Rico ! I felt so sad for the poor People there …🙏🏼hope everybody is going to be al Right !
My heart hurts again for Puerto Rico. Please, I hope Biden has a better response to Puerto Rico than trump.🙏  We are praying for you.
Whats funny is that we’ve been without powers all day, way before the storm got here. The power grid here is so bad it makes me mad and we pay too much one of the highest in the US thats the real tragedy. You blow out a candle and the powers goes out.
A. SUPER. AWESOME. REPORT. WAW. BLESS ALL THERE. THIS. IS THE CHANEL TO FOLOW.  TNKS

This is not Globe Warming,  People have put their Bible Away,  The Bible has this written already,  We are in our last days,  And God is PISSED OFF at The Flaesh. People better get right

I am so sorry the people of Puerto Rico are going through this AGAIN!   I Pray they and the animals get through this safely. I have hope that President Biden will truly help the people. Not  throw paper towels at them like tfg!
Repent wicked nation pr Your Christian values had gone far from the Statues of God worshipping the sodomites music that the whole island has as their religion,repent this is nothing compare to what is written in revelation 6, repent from your falling away from God destruction is drawing near
نیشاپور بود
I grew up near Galveston, we would literally go out and play and drive around in this kinda storm..not kidding.
نيشا بور   يا نيشا‌پ‌ور ؟
They don’t do a good job building bridges.
Cos

Fione
I feel a sense of sadness for the people of Puerto Rico, however, what improvements have been made to electrical power and water issues since the last big storm? Where did the money go that your governor received?

It breaks my heart. Worry  about my family and the rest of people    from Puerto  Rico.  Players  on the way.  God protect them all.  My beautiful island where I was born   you will be  always in my heart.
The reason the bridge was gone. Because the job was crap work or else it would had not moved
After the storm cease count the damage 😱👀
This journalist is risking his life on those dangerous conditions. Our prayers 🙏 with Puerto Rico and its people.  Be Safe. Be Strong!
🙏
It appears that bridge which was rebuilt after Maria was no better constructed than the one before. One gets what one pays for. The island is full of wealthy families who will not be greatly affected by this, as was the case case with Maria - hmm....... I wonder why?
Trump's fault
Welcome to the Hell on earth you people have created this world into.....So as we treat this planet so shall it treat us back...Humans are a Cancer to this world we are slowly trying to kill her and she is now finally realizing what we are doing and trying to save herself the only difference is it only takes one small catastrophic event to end all Life on earth and no one is going to listen till it is to late because that is the sum of what humans are...stupid
Dios mío, ayuda a esa gente
Bye bye rico
Here we go again. And they want sovereignty, until the storms come
Glad it already passed me
Omg! PR have not recovered from Maria five yrs ago. God’s you are in controlled help all the families in PR .. It’s too much for the PR ..❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹🙏🙏
WE WANT OIL
Tantos años que Puerto Rico vive con ayudas de la Nación Estadounidense, y ha estás alturas seguimos con la misma infraestructura y no mejoran absolutamente nada, en vez de tomar acción antes de que ocurra lo inesperado, siempre dejan todo para último al parecer podría decir que se ha convertido en una tradición. Hugo, George, Maria entre otros huracanes dejaron demasiada devastación en el pasado como para que el Puertorriqueño y su Gobierno tome un incentivo de crear manejos de emergencias más apropiados, dar mantenimiento diario a cablerías de electricidad, eliminar obstáculos de ramas de arboles, limpiar terrenos que estén a la deriva de obstrucción de caminos o vías, examinar y tomar medidas preventivas sobre estructuras no fiables como por ejemplo el puente que acaba de desprenderse… la madre naturaleza siempre dominará y no pesa ni discrimina que seas buen ciudadano por eso es mejor prevenir formalizando planes estructurados que beneficien a largo plazo antes que lamentar y poner en peligro vidas.
My goodness, so much devastation, earthquake in Taiwan, deaths and destruction there too, and now again Puerto Rico, it's citizens and lively hood all destroyed all over again.  Oh my dear people, I hope you are safe, and few deaths are reported.  You and your loved ones, friends and your pets.  Please do not leave them behind if you go up to high ground.  Oh my so much disasters all in one day worldwide.
Prayers do not change the environmental degradation and climate change that governments have failed to overhaul.
That is horrible. The challenges the island will face in recovery will be very big even though the people have been resilient in the past and I believe in the future.

Any guess how many billions will be spent to restore PR to the third world state it was in B4 the hurricane? Don’t forget to add a couple billion the politicians will skim off the top for their own use.
God is testing everybody and everyone!!!! To see who still believes in the Lord and god our father!!!!!!! Can’t depend on man to help  Especially Democrats
Yup that is what Hurricanes do and there have been hurricanes hitting that at that Island for decades.  It is called weather folks.

Yall news ppl kill me...yall always recording but tell ppl to seek a safe point
The USVI r praying for Puerto Rico 🇵🇷, we know what u know u feeling & going thru. Hurricane Fiona did damage for the USVI, St. Croix partially, where I live. (Hurricane Hugo in 1990 & destroyed the USVI & Puerto Rico & Hugo Maria in 2017, destroying the USVI & Puerto Rico again).Fiona, became a Hurricane CAT 1 @11am, and she was still in St. Croix, we were getting the tail end of Fiona. The meteorologist don’t know everything, they were not actually here, we had NO ONE here from CNN or any other news reporting what damages Fiona was doing here. But I can tell u, rain started from late Friday night @11am, thru 3am early Saturday morning and then again from 10am to 2pm, then Fiona made landfall to St. Croix, we got the brunt of her on SouthSide, exactly the side I live on. Rains began @4pm yesterday, Saturday afternoon and has been raining up until about an hour ago, 7:15pm tonight (Sunday, 9/18), we experienced heavy rains, thunderstorms and extreme high winds, @ least up to 85mph. The rain has eased up a bit, but according to the radar, we r going to b having more rain by late this evening, into tomorrow afternoon. We r thankful to God for blessing us. We r not sure of what r the damages on the island, until tomorrow morning, our schools & Government will b closed tomorrow, so they can access any damages. We do have flooding in various parts of the island. An alert was sent out earlier advising us of the closure, as well of possible road closures and advised for no one to be in the roads until the assessment. I just wanted to let everyone know, that Fiona did hit the USVI; St. Croix 🇻🇮 too, as well as Guadeloupe 🇬🇵, Montserrat 🇲🇸 & Saint Kitts and Nevis 🇰🇳.  So we the USVI 🇻🇮 r praying for Puerto Rico 🇵🇷, Dominican Republic 🇩🇴, Turks and Caicos 🇹🇨 as well as Bermuda 🇧🇲 and the other islands that were affected before us. Thank u oh Lord and Lord we r asking u to please bless & protect Puerto Rico, DR and the other islands. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
🙏🙏🇵🇷
I would bet the politicians have generators , everyone else can suffer
🙏🙏 Prayers
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
Don't worry! The USVI is ok... not that you EVER talk about us... we got hit by irma and Maria!
US taxpayers will be milked again by corrupt Puerto Rican officials, bend over.
Prayers
GOD BLESS 🙏 EVERYONE 🙏🙏🙏🙏
My heart goes out to the people in Puerto Rico 🙏🙏🇵🇷
Poor Americans, no help for you well maybe little and late, because democrats have to give all money to fight foreign wars and they couldn’t care less for you.
Biden is on this. He has a heart,  unlike the heartless trumpsterd.
Gabi zero give a f.
I understand it did nearly $25 worth of damage
After all the money sent to Ukraine I hope Biden can find some for Puerto Rico.
Praying for my people in Puerto Rico please Lord keep everyone safe
Lord have mercy🙏
Build a building for that water
All over the world climate change is happening

Not religious but praying to whatever or whomever is listening that the people and all other beings of PR kept safe as possible.
Hope you guys are all safe and hopefully all that water drains by the next day Fiona go away and stop hurting people they are already dealing with a lot
President Biden now is the time to show the people of Puerto Rico that they are Americans and send immediate help. These are the same people who have given up lives and limbs in every war protecting our nations freedom.
All these dumb weather channels make it seem like its their first hurricane and its not even close to the worse
Breathlessly awaiting the media's tireless coverage of Joe Biden's lightning quick response
Omg, not again!
Puerto Rico STRONG.
Weather patterns are getting more severe daily
Gabi Acevedo be careful, siempre haces un buen trabajo. Stay safe
Prayers
💔🙏😢
Normally when a bridge gets rebuilt, it should get re-engineered for a 200 yr flow event, not a flat replacement. 🤷‍♂️ Hoping all are safe. 🤞
Last storm trump was handing out toilet paper will he do it again 🤔
Ponce es Ponce             ❤
Lord God be with my people in Puerto Rico. Please keep them safe and let there be a speedy recovery. In Jesus name. I love you all!!!
Go ask Europe
Puerto Rico is always hit by huracans, my country never gets hits.
HELLO MY PRAYER GO OUT TO EVERY ONE AND FAMILY MAY GOD BE WITH THEM ALL  BE SAFE 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
ASIENDO PORQUERIA LOS CONTRATISTAS
Their one solar panel was taken out again 😞
Blessings to PR island and it’s peoples 🙏❤️
Hoping no death 🙏
Hold love in you hearts not fear bring God with you as you walk through this hurricane. Love to you all
Revelation 14 v 6-7 And I saw a Seraphim Angel  fly over the earth pronounce the Gospel of Christ to this world ... Revelation 20 v 15 Whosoever will not be found written in the book of Christ will be cast into the ocean of fire for all eternity ...Probation for humanity is closing fast as cosmic disturbances and great tribulation intensify .Hold on tight to Jezus the end of all things draws terribly near
Y porque la jentes es tan estúpido de salir quitando de bajo de una tormentas
😳
So sad
Just can't believe it again first it was hurricane Maria and their having recuperated now Fiona why why why something wrong With Puerto Rico to much sin of the minds
They didn't do a good job rebuilding that bridge after the last hurricane
Esta ca**on
Omg not again. I feel for my people and all the homeless animals.
God be with my people in Puerto Rico. Gaby Acevedo did a great job. Really good reporting!🙏🏻🇵🇷
We're going to need to get people in there as soon as it's over to help restore power and fix roads
Favor de tener cuidado, !Gaby e Puerto Rico!
The new bridge that swept away - the engineering & construction companies should be investigated 😡Disgraceful that the people of PR were stuck with a useless bridge
Trump said the hurricane was fake and the democrats are using special effects
Lets see how the US help Puerto Rico
Might be a good time to move before the next one
jajajaja electricity will be restored in days who believes that is true?
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
The World Is Falling Apart Rapidly  I'll Catch Yall In The Next RELM
Not again.  Those poor people.
Esto fue como pa callarle la boca a LUMA Energy y a los que dijeron que el grid electrico estaba ready para recibir otro "Maria". Basta ya coño.
Who drives around in a hurricane to report news? It must be a calling.
Let us pray continiously for the people of Puerto Rico. May God have mercy upon these nice people. Puerto Rico was a Tower of strength for the people of the British Virgin Islands in 2017.. We love them. We appreciate them and we are praying for them. God is in control...
Oh that can't be good
😞 God bless PR and everywhere else.
Those poor people. This is the last thing they need.
These hurricanes are getting worse.
What a crappy made bridge....
Bye bye IRS. Oops
The DR will get hit even worse its mountains are up to 8000 ft elevation and many more rivers .
Trump can throw paper towels if needed.
THAT bridge was not made very well to just float away like that . shoddy construction is rampant in the southern USA where the construction was done in puerto rico .
So devastating to here. Hoping for the best for the ppl and the island of Puerto Rico 🇵🇷
If only they had  already outlawed gasoline,  deisel  and cattle in Puerto Rico...This hurricane would gave never formed....sarc.    This is what leftists cimate fools actually believe.   Hopefully PR doesn't have a fool leading them like the last fool in the last hurricane. An entire massive warehouse of supplies sent by Trump was never distributed but she had already spent weeks blaming him when she and her entire leadership were unqualified posers.
Lord have mercy bless everyone 🙏🏼🙏🏼😔
That my uncles house in Ponce in the back with the black gates on the porch
hope we're sendng help, this country needs it!
