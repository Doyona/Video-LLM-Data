It's crazy how he came in right afterv on and then he start talking about how you feel in. You couldn't take it bro, you had whiff. Drawers, and that's why you told cause you couldn't handle it. And I know you told cause anybody that got an obsession when you told me. Cause why is it that they tackled king von when he got caught up? And you just made a song and said I'm turning myself. In think about that now, just think about that.
Ksoo is going away for life dude. He’s done

Whats your fave songs from booka or memo or atleast a song they have a feature in? I like them but dont know a whole lot of their whole top songs. The few ive heard ive always likes
I'm here
It's 2025 but this music video dropped four years ago but King Von died 5 years ago how does this make sense King Von died 2020 it is now 2025 but yet the video dropped four years ago that would have been 2021 because it shows him singing the lyrics in the music video and usually they don't have the person that died in the music video or if they do it's from a different video which is flashbacks of memories of them not them singing word for word in the music video so if this video drop 2021 how the heck is he in this video singing word for word
Memo part tuff asl

Von a Chicago legend. The realest story teller.
I just got a free durk hoodie off his official merch page. Dude never snitched. Dude is a real one. Some say he back doored von cuz of the 21 savage thing that night and what happened. It is suspicious but I dont think durk would throw his life away for a lie I think he stood up for his man's and thats why he is where he is. FREE DURK!!!!

No one can beat Lil Durk because of       i) His  voice      ii)  he is byin vews  fram *HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM*       iii) fans like me
Yo what crazy is memo600 wasn't even named on this when it came out than he was put as a ft. Like Lil Durk ain't tha rl feat of this song he rap for maybe 13-36 seconds on here. But he named first truthfully it's Booka & Memo song.
1:22 This is what Drake needs to learn how to do instead of filing lawsuits everytime he loses a Rap battle.
Nov 2024🔥🔥
What’s lil durks tracksuit
Von did better
Memo600 rhythm play was always nice 🫡
If Chicago weren't beefing like they do ... They could've had da game smashed... They done switched the game up though
Durk was like suge knight to a lot of rappers

What song did von get that flow from when he said “he don’t even wan drill nomo”
Hard
Ngl booka and memo was best part
I like how they let you know they were together in person by putting their chains together, even though the court said they couldn’t be. No actual proof but they still let us know they were seeing each other despite the courts restriction.
https://youtu.be/4_GxlC7wdS0  Still here
Von and durk going back and forth with each other you can clearly see it 😂😂if you can’t peep it you ain’t a real listener

Von was and will forever remain THE GOAT… probably the realest to ever do it, a straight beast lyrically and an amazing personality to match.. what he accomplished his short time on the scene was unprecedented and he has forever changed the game.. everywhere you look there is another V-Roy wannabe in the rap game now… but no one will ever measure up because Von was one of a kind… A Real One..  a trendsetter.. A True Star… THE GOAT..!!! RIP V-Roy.. Drill up Broski 🕊️
Ksoo fucked up. Shouldn’t have been doing that dumb shit in Florida
King von is a great rapper but he is a piece of shit so i don’t get why people praise this dude like he did good things when he was around

"he think he slick, I know he told" ...
This song needs to blow up
Durk goes so hard on this swear

Weird listening to Von's verse. Sounds like he's speakin on Durk with events as of recent. As if he already knew what was going on and it was too late.
“He think he slick, I know he told” -Von “Ima rich nigga for life but ain tryna risk my life” - Durk
Got to skip the first half of the song, 2nd half 🔥 though
I got you Brodie 🖤🖤🖤
👑Von💫

King von - “you ever been in a car with your homie who don’t got the wheel, he can’t slide he need him a pill he a bich it is what it is”  Lil Durk”I was down bad on my dick and the nigga ain't take my advice I was tryna make my night, but the Percocets ruined my life  These was their back to back verses on the same song they were talking to each other about that case on their songs
open ya eyes von dissed durk and durk responded back. All on this track😳 of course durk recorded his verse after von died.

Durk and Von as usual carried this song
YES. VON
King von Was THE VOICE, Durk is just Keeping Von Legacy. Rip King Von 😭😭
Sometimes have to play pussy in life I’m from Iraq I walked from country to another for 4 days me and my whole family lived in scariest environments I learned survival mode that’s only way I’m tough as mother fucker but my surviving mode it a lot bigger which is why I made it alive and my family   My dad told me when I was little even though he was abusive he taught me one thing never touch anyone if they didn’t harass you never do anything to anyone who didn’t do to you Von rest in peace forgot about survival mode he was smart what he did was out of his character he wanted to defend his team and impress someone but he left his skills behind and that’s why he died
Rest in Peace King Von one of the realest niggas who took care of his people and community even that he made faults everybody does that nigga went trough so much shit but kept it real even the people in jail i heard he did send money he knew or who asked and was from his hood 💯 Rest in peace King Von 💯🙏💪 Legend real King 💯

Finally realized Von talking about Durk and Booka 🤦🏾‍♂️
Jane long was too real for his gang too real for old block too real for this lifetime in general he was too ahead of the game and he was right when he said niggas ain't gonna sliding no more they ain't even going to ride no more wow that was to you ll dink right there that's supposed to be evil training evil twin I just don't get dirt so you know what I mean if not him do it why not pay to get it done you know if it was the other way around volume would have done his damn self ten times over for any one of his crew members that's real love for your game but again I guess that's why his game was OTF only the family only saying yes he was trying to help so many people come up he let some get in that wasn't family and come on to her make a move do something you know what I mean go grab you a Glock and start heading that way you know what I mean take a pistol charging at least look like a real one you're supposed to have a body count up into the double digits but the steppers said you only got 1 kill and that was your brother von it's only stabbed once or twice that wouldn't think twice love my nigga K. von and Lil Durk get this figured out man you know your man's deserves better and he deserves his respect and his get back that was guaranteed to him before he was gone but he felt y'all switching up on him that's why his last final words was shut up and quit crying y'all let them get up on me y'all let them get me von would have never Rided like this he said when I die n****** is boosting the murder rate he really thought y'all loved him he thought once he did get taken out one of y'all was going to slide for him and it was supposed to be evil twin evil twin and fuck the fame and all that bs we come from the streets where the shit really matters I guarantee you if Durk died  Von went behind no steppers he'd would went and took care of the shooter and the showers shooter to care that out so his brother didn't died over some lil bitch or for the wrong Street or the wrong hookah bar y'all think all that was just the general come on you all they have long played from the moment he woke up that day he knew he was dying that night he just didn't know it would be his own group his own gang to do  him that way that man was the VIP they could have and should have done so much more to prevent this from happening but with that being said if it was his own gang or not that did it they did Jack his chains after he passed but I've all sentimental value it all comes and goes just like everything in this world because of your lies but if lawns game didn't do it I feel like they're just as guilty as doing it for not retaliating I mean a lot of people would be saying it would be stupid for a llil Durk to try to pull something but how everyone else sees it he's a b**** if he don't I mean he ain't got to make the head but he's got the money to make the head trying to do the do it for 50 g's right now
He lost his legs to a wheelchair
Who else hear the beat kinda switch or is it just me?

Coming back to this classic love you von fr fr rip💔🐐
Jesus Christ Saves  Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.  Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.  EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:  1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.  2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.  Biblical References: 1. Romans 5:9 2. Romans 3:23 3. Romans 6:23 4. Romans 10:9 5. Romans 10:13 6. Ephesians 2: 8 & 9 7. John 3:16  God bless you, peace be with you always. Thank you for your time.
VONNN!!!!!🔥🔥💯

0:54 best part dude can rap so good
🩸 bloods

Durk can i remix?
Von had the hardest Verse. I hate that you got sacrificed . You aint deserve that
still a few hittas frm the 6
Memo and von had the Best verse
RIP King Von 👑. I feel like after lil Peep and Juice World it was nice to see rappers stand for something and rap about it other than drugs. Even if their outcome was the same, it was like it meant more.
0:33
Von showed his progression in his flow with this joint. His lyrics and storytelling have always been on point. He was putting it all together.
😑💯😑💯😑💯😑💯😑💯😑💯😑💯😑💯😑💯😑
Memo600 verse 🔥🔥🔥
Durk u went too krazzzyyyy
Memo went krazzy bt Kingvon is da song
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
10 seconds in and this shit feels bizarre. Aight I know this Chicago drill but ima say som bout Jacksonville drill. This video was shot back when Ksoo was still free, and still f'in wit Von. The fact that Von still has so much songs and videos that we ain't seen or heard, shows his hard-as-hell work ethic in the industry. RIP Grandson 🙏🙏🙏
Durk verse the weakest of the 4
VON!!!!!!!

You better do your homework Brose because you better look up in the dictionary that the hose or Nager’s that are low down good for nothing people in the dictionary has nothing to do with colour or race get down my bro I’m white or than your race
I miss von 😫
All these people in these comments, king von and durk were bro's. King von clearly talking about big mike (who snitched on him) and his opps who may have snitched on him. Show me some evidence other than lyrics in songs that they von had beef with anyone from otf, oblock, frontstreet, 600. In multiple interviews, they show each other the upmost respect. Show me at least a grain of evidence before chatting shit, everyone loved von so stop ✋ 😒 🙄
R.I.P VROY
Booka is 🔥🔥🔥 #LLVROY #OTF
Man when the fuck BD gon let a white grim reaper join DA TEAM🖤  I’m 🌐👐🏼🤝🏙

Sounds like Von was going at Durk and Durk was trying to explain hisself. Durk even mentions a fall out on Top, “if you fall out w/ your brudda jus don’t let em go/ Ain’t get to tell em fo he died I wish I lettem kno. So it all kinda adds up. Von was feeling some type of way about Durk fasho
“If u don’t wanna shoot just pass it bro” chiraq classic🤴LLKV 🕊

Anyone else think vons verse was a diss to durk and durks verse was a diss to von? Von said “you ever been in the car with your homie who don’t got the wheel he can’t slide he need him a pill he a bitch it is what it is that’s yo man you tryna uplift” then durk said “I know a rich nigga homeless got me a deal ain’t homeless yeah yeah” I could be trippin but I don’t think von had his own house idk
I jus realized Ksoo was in the beginning lmao

King von: Have you been in a car with a homie that don't got the wheel he can't slide he need him a pill he's a bitch then pointed at LIL DURK... lil durk: said  he didn't pop the pill yet. He won't risk his life.

Funny how I still come back to watch this video #LLKV
Lets b clear Booka had the best flow on tis then Memo.. the only 2 SixO members .. they set the tempo.
Surely durk von wouldve chilled together despite their charge during this video

Memo and booka had the best verse 🔥
1:20
Ksoo & Von  Come here boy

The flow on this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
tf ksoo  doing in chicago
So King Von  just gone diss memo600 like that in the same song he 🤣🤣🤣 real life savage  Rest Up VoN
Is that KSOO at the beginning?
“Had some beef in the Nola (Louisiana) nigga and ain’t even know it, heard you rappin that gangsta shit now you gotta show me”    ~King Von - Mine too  Reference to nba youngboy and main reason why von started fucking his baby mamma and put her (Jania) in this video.   There were numerous rumours and videos of NBA and Vons beef while Von was still alive and at the time most people thought nothing of it and remember the video of king Von name listing all the people he cool wit that were direct opps to youngboy like Fredo and others? Seeing as quando was cool with Von or snaking🐍 him from the beginning because of a lowkey dislike of Von from youngboy, that Von prolly didn’t even know about yet but could have led to some sneak dissin from rondo that made Von likely to pull up on him where ever and whenever, which we all know the result of unfortunately.  But can’t deny that man was a real one #LLKV 🕊
2:03 Durk know the entire planet atp
MEMO A SNAKE
Just saw Ksoo at the beginning nearly shit my self
Von came with that fire
When Tf we given passes ? If you don’t wanna shoot  jus pass it bro ... von to real
Lil Durk and von dissing each other on the same song ....Durk no where in the video ....only time he in the video is for his verse and the whole verse he is not seen with anyone in the song should tell u ...Durk was added into the song ....von knew he snitched on the court case ...knew he wasn’t really sliding...so who would have more reason to get von out the way ....u guessed it Durk that’s why in back in blood 🩸 Durk said he was dissing on my cousin now his ass all in that wood ....dropped same day von shot and von did diss lil mister 🤔...we were shown von getting shot  on video so how could Durk have sacrificed von ...u gotta ask yourself von was tryna end the beef ...so why was von at the same club as lil Tim and quando and Vons manager stated von didn’t seem himself right before shit happen ...soooo then u gotta ask yourself its already known that the industry will send u to weird as party’s drug u all that sooo was von drugged was he really not himself where is Durk .....oh yea on live when von shot people blowing up his comments and he showed 0 emotion just cut the live some say he even smirked before cutting it ....all I’m saying is von knew he ratted on him in that court case and he knew Durk really bitch made and Durk couldn’t have that coming to life same thing with fbg duck he said in his I’m from 63rd ...u a sacrifice he sent u to get bodied basically he just signed you Over to the Illuminati....he talking about von ....then where he says u one of them niggas I would smack then he goes on to say you lie in all your raps .....pants tight as hell how u  tote your gun ....how you run probably fell ....all that about Durk .....duck tried to warn von of what was to come and duck knew he was dying after saying the Illuminati shit ....that’s why he said wanna see a dead body bow now a nigga dead by me that was him saying him and von bout to die... they both buried in Chicago ... hence the bar now a nigga dead by me  ..... Not up for debate
Von went hard
booka seriously up next
Niggas sleep von and Durk was dissing each other ....Durk added his verse and added him self into the video why u think when Durk came on he was nowhere in the video but in that car 🤔🤭
And where can I get the hoodie von wearin
“I’m a real nigga for life but ain’t trynna risk my life” THIS ONE OF DURKS MOST UNDERRATED VERSES EVER!!! Dude is really the voice it’s crazy
Real nigga for Life but I ain't gone risk my Life wish niggas listen
This song got me lit and emotional at the same time
You can tell  durk wasn’t supposed to be on dis

Rip von
After vons death every time I hear him on a song my whole body gets the chill
He was better than durk crazy part llkv
Durk: as the leader I should be apart of this
Hi wassup lil durk
RIP VON  👼
The sacrifice makes sense. Durk told so he had to silence con before the full truth came out.  Considering how Von was hinting at Durk in his sound “How he told”.   Von didn’t record this wit them you can tell his verse was just put up here,  You listen close enough and go back to when they caught that case together all the charges they each are referring to they each were charged With…  Notice that case disappeared since we lost Von.
Rest in Peace Big Homie 😭😭😭
Rip bozo
Von🗣🗣 😇😇😇👊🏽👊🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💯💯💯💨💨💨😒👼🏽👼🏽👼🏽👼🏽RIP #KINGVON
King von rest in peace real gang star no gang shit straight gang

WHOLE TIME VON WAS RAPPING, listen, HE WAS TALKIN BOUT DURK, EVEN ON “ion know why he told” THAT WAS ABOUT DURK, AND HE HATED AND ENVY HOW VON HAD THAT STREET CRED HE RAPPED ABOUT BUT DIDNT HAVE, ENVY HOW QUICK HE BLEW UP AND WAS GOOD AND LOVED SO MUCH. But at the end of the day Durk knew he had to sacrifice to be where he at and that’s why von not here wit us today!
Am I the only one who thinks the guy at 1:24 looks like Zahir from Icebox lmfao
Smh 👁

We still 💜 and miss u 👑😥
Free ksoo😈🎋
Y’all saying Von and Durk were dissing each other and weren’t hanging together, y’all just instigating, I hate y’all, they weren’t hanging because they can’t legally be around each other, they’re both felons and known gang members and they caught a case together, one of their bond requirements were to completely stay away from each other which is normal because when you’re on parole, you’re required to stay away from gang members else your ass will be violating your parole and your ass getting snatched off the streets and locked up because the law already hates you for what they call “glorifying or promoting violence”  Stop reaching, y’all be the ones instigating so hard trying to turn 2 black men against each other for your entertainment, a lot of y’all enforcers of this dumb ass conspiracy theories are probably not even black.
I know I ain’t the only one who saw ksoo
This shit is hard…. They all got off. They could’ve ended with Von
Vonn🖤🐐🐐
King Von Still Here!

if von only knew....how fitting his verse. a prequel to Nov 6
It’s crazy cuz I know dis whole damn song by heart

I do feel like Von and Durks part was a little arguement, but respect them for being honest about their feelings. Courage to put period.. But a great song out of it... That dying to hit em is my shit thou.. their best album to date and shows the growth they're making
Yeah him and memo played off of each other perfect.. they handled their own... ran this like a inning in baseball.... I think booka put the album togethet.. Booka!!! Good job... I had a cat named Booka for 16 years and he was black. This was 20 years ago
RIP Von
2-4-14 III
Von the voice. LLKV
LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAYING VON DYING WAS PLANNED THEY TALKING TO EACHOTHER. Maybe he was that loyal to durk.
All you idiots king von is in this video how? King von didn't die if you see the footage it's all staged and it was a ritual sacrifice for LeBron James. Levon James album. King von was another puppet on strings and "died by the numbers. In my opinion I don't think king von died. This was just his expiration date and he sacrificed his career and fame. Faked his death
Von still pose to be here
Durk got mad cuz von kicked it wit glo gang
Von n durk dissin each other on the sly
“Them niggas aint sliding no more (nah) the opps outside , Man them niggas ain’t hiding no more (what ) well I guess we ain’t the guys no more, when you see a nigga killed your brother you don’t ask ,just blow “ ain’t von always put the guys over anything? Why he say they ain’t the guys no more and he threw that shot at memo for not killing his brother killer !

Rest in power Von!
It’s weird seeing these dudes is lowkey mainstream, when they was just known in Chicago
LLKLA LLKV
King von
Llldurk
I think Von was talking about memo on his verse.. hear me out!   Von says: “when you said a nigga killed your brother, you don’t ask, just blow. When the fuck we started giving passes tho, if you don’t wanna shoot, just pass it bro”.   Memo’s younger brother, Lil Steve, was killed by an opp. There was a moment where Memo had the chance to kill his brothers killer but passed the gun to his friend who also passed the gun to another friend, in which his brothers killer got away.   I may be thinking too hard but those events actually took place and it makes perfect sense regarding Von’s verse.
Ksoo in da back
0:54 - 1:21 🔥
Von dropped the most flows
King von😭 we miss yu😥

Memo600 part fye
King Von looks so tired/ exhausted in this video. That man was workin hard
We ain’t gon act like memo ain’t went the hardest 🔥‼️
Who would’ve ever thought BOOKA & MEMO would have the best part
Y’all see ksoo
I didnt fuck ait durks verse it lowkey was ass compared to the others
" When the fuck we start giving passed though" Von was trying to say something on dat verse
Why lil durk make back in blood and cryed at his funeral but he set someone up to kill him
Want a von hoodie like the one he has in video bright orange but cant find please help 🙇‍♂️🙏
Just relized its ksoo at 0:09
I swear this drill scene grew on me so much over this past year. I come from listening to Emcees and Lyricists, but these artists from Chicago are killing it right now, no cap. Mad love and respect to all of y’all. This track a banger, I can play this shit every time I’m in my car.
Well deserved
rip von👑
No cap😢
https://youtube.com/channel/UCGR5AO4wMoqEVSrzN8Pb-1g
vons part on this needed a little more mastering, ngl
this beat good
I bet nobody knew that lil steeve is memo600 brother
Just realized they got Ksoo in the vid
This song is so weird, you got Von dissing his own gang because they won’t slide no more and Durk trying to tell his guys to become successful and stop sliding. They diss and contradict each other many times in this song...
Von verse was a Diss... Simple as that...
This came out the day before my sister birthday
1:40-2:03 he talking bout o block?
I miss u von my boa
VON 😔😪💔
Have you ever been on a drill when no one you shot got killed 🔥
Fuck this song is amazing.. Grammy Winner 🏆 perfect crescendo and apex
King Von Verse sounded like he had A lil LA Capone in em🔥
Timothy can go to hell 🤬rip von 😣
I wish hell on von killa
0:10
These niggas got ksoo on n this bih
is im only one when durk says how u run blocks you aint kill shit and it showed king von and hes chain
So were Von and Durk in the same video🤔🤨???? At the same time
Only because king 🤴 von in it not lil durk I don’t like lil durk ew🤢🤮
Fuck yeah O block
Not gone lie this song give me sneak dissing vibes I feel like von talking about memo cuz memo always have that draco but didn't do nothing when he seen the nigga MOB Scrap that killed his brother lil Steve, & I feel like he talking about durk thincing he slicc about telling from that case they caught (ex The song Why He Told) and durk always have to pop pills to be lit & Durk replied on his verse like he did his time he ain't never tell & how he got a lawyer  to get him off type shit, & how he tried to give von all this advice but von never listens & durk threw a shot at Lil Baby cuz lil baby doesn't have his own house but hes rich you can look it up lil baby talks about it, but this whole vibe crazy & von looks tired n this video like he sicc of the bullshit that's why he put his homies on blast type shit you get me??
Von that nigga
0:33 who else saw ksoo
I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. (Luke 13:5) Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. (Isaiah 55:7) When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. (Mark 2:17)
Omg king von

He can't slide, he need him a pill He a bitch, it is what it is That's your mans you tryna uplift But when it's war time, niggas ain't gon' do shit” he talking bout durk and then durk confirms it in the song “I'm a real nigga for life, but I ain't tryna risk my life like yeah, yeah (Let's get it) I was down bad on my dick and the nigga ain't take my advice, yeah, yeah  I was tryna make my night, but the Percocets ruined my life, yeah, yeah I'm a real nigga for life, but I ain't tryna risk my life like yeah, yeah, I was down bad on my dick and the nigga ain't take my advice, yeah, yeah  I was tryna make my night, but the Percocets ruined my life, yeah

Unlike many star artist that pass away  I honestly felt Von had so much more potential to further his career as he was so talented.

memo and booka going back and forth too hard no cap 🐐
All the niggas in this video knew von was gonna die
Durk only did his Verse or video part after death of von, i dont think he was supposed to be on this track
RIP Von🙏🏿
Durk backdoored/setup Von.   KingVon - Why he told KingVon - What its like  Lil Durk - Back in blood - because von spoke about lil mister (Durks blood cousin) and credited 051Melly (Killed  Nuski WHO IS also durks cousin), VIDEO WAS DROPPED AFTER VONS DEATH. "Dissing my cousin now your ass all up in that Wood huh!" while wearing a RED(Blood) Cap with Vroy on it.  Lil Durk - Backdoor - wearing Vroys Chain, he did ask Von for it but only release video after his death as if he knew all along or had a plan, he actually the one doing the snake and setup but portray Backdoor song as Generalizing. but it just subliminals, have a Good listen to backdoor verses/Listen to understand   Durk also had OTF family make songs that was about Von/Getbacks/Opps/death of his brother while he was alive but only releasing a mixtape after his death, starting the tape off with song JUMP (decides to put Vons perfectly suited Verse in) OTF also have no idea, Durk had his hidden agendas which the result was Vons death, self wealth, OTF exposure & popularity/Trending.  Durk also always went live listening to a song smiling at camera after an opp was killed, he did the exact same thing after Vons death. then deactivated his acc because it hurt stomach since he realized he had his once Homie/brother Killed. THATS REALITY HITTING.  ONLY Vons manager speaking on situation also stating only very little details, with a bit of parts that makes absolutely no sense.  also Durks Lawyer and vons Manager are FEDS!  LLKV
Y’all sleeping on memo verse 😴
Why durk shot his part of the video after von passed cus he had the V.Roy ring on?????🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️    Meanwhile von and others shot they part in August
Memo came a long way
King Von autopsyhttps://youtu.be/Wgq-gcnHPwM

@rebecca taylor its a japanese skin lightening lotion. It says in the article the african american celebrities in hollywood use it because it actually changes their skin color from dark skin to light skin mixed race,however they deny it https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/bleaching-skin-lightening-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml-top-selling-product  i guess they deny using this  lotion because they just want people to think they are naturally light skinned and not bleaching their skin lighter, they should just be honest.

Von Still got so much heat we ain’t heard
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.

God saids, These guys are in serious trouble with him. So U Don't want to be them. They need Jesus's forgiveness. They can get it tho b4 they die. Well some of them. Not king von sadly. Lets not let any people go to hell by others being merciless to eachother. We all gotta stick by each others side as A family!👫🤝👨‍👩‍👦‍👦🤝🤴🤝🤴🤝🤴🏰
That grill aint hiding how fucked up memo teeth is. How much silver yall think it took to fill in memos gap. Lol spent all that money on a grill. Shoulda got braces or invisaline
Am I tripping or do dirk got the vroy ring on ?
Memo and Booka back and forth is just ridiculously 🔥🔥🔥
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
OHH von why?
I miss von
If u  listen to von's verse carefully u will realise that  somehow he was like talking about durk and the rest of the OTF mist especially that last part where he was like "Them niggas ain’t slidin’ no more (Nah) The opps outside, man, them niggas ain’t hidin’ no more (What?) Well, I guess we ain’t the guys no more (Damn) When you see a nigga killed your brother, you don’t ask, just blow (Boom, boom) When I fuck with stars, give me passes though (Damn) And if you don’t wanna shoot just pass it, bro Fuck y’all wearing them masks for? (Huh, what?) Niggas got guns, but they ain’t gon’ blow (Huh? Yeah)

The only part of this song that's good is Vons. Makes me remember my days and night in the hood. The way he speak you know he really lives it. He knows how it really feels. Everything he says. As if he was right there with me. Too bad you gone bro. Not too many rappers worth listening to. All actors and studio gangsters or fruits. The real ones don't last. They end up dead, in jail or on the run.

This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.

Lil Durk said : *My bother lost his life to a wheelchair?*  Does he mean crip like Quando Rondo, and is his brother von?
Imagine if Von didn't decide to swing and punch that guy...he could have been alive right now. But the music content is about I killed you... I gotta gun I'll kill you blah blah blah.  Listen to the lyrics of this song . . .it's entire content is about having a gun and the willingness to kill another black person. Oh well black people have a mission. . . there mission is to surpass the killing rate of themselves pass the slavers, he  KKK and the white supremacists combined.

John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.  God is loving and literally True Love; God loves us and wants us not to perish but have everlasting (eternal) life! You don't have to go to Hell, as it was created only for the devil and the fallen angels, but when you don't choose God you automatically (even if you don't realize or mean it) choose the opposite, which is the devil and eternal death, because of your sin-nature. The devil and his minions fates are sealed, which is why he wants to bring as many people down with him before he enters his eternal punishment/torture in the lake of fire and brimstone (with his minions/followers).   BUT THERE'S HOPE FOR US(the way to God)! And that way and hope is Jesus! | John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. | Heaven is open for all through, and ONLY through Jesus Christ! Jesus is the doorway to the Father (who house is Heaven !) God gave us instructions in how to accept him which is accepting Jesus, so again you do not want to miss out on this FREE GIFT FROM GOD then ACCEPT JESUS IN YOUR HEART TODAY! You are not promised tomorrow!                                                         Q: What must I do to be saved?  A: If you’re asking this question, you’re not far from salvation. Getting saved is a blessed gift from God!  First of all, it is important to realize that  there is only one way to God, and that is through Jesus Christ, the Lord and Savior of the world (John 14:6). The Word of God says if you believe with your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, and confess Jesus as your Lord, you will be saved (Romans 10:9-10).  ( Romans 3:23-24 ) for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.   There is a Heaven to gain, and a Hell to shun!  Salvation is a free gift that God offers us because of His unconditional love through the sacrifice Jesus made in our behalf: “But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners” (Romans 5:8).  That should remove any doubts about you being worthy to be saved. Salvation is not something we deserve, nor is it something we can earn. It is a gift that was purchased and paid for by the blood of Jesus. Through the cross, God laid the punishment for our sin on Jesus so that we might have right-standing with God through faith in Him (2 Corinthians 5:21).  Jesus was our substitute. He took the pain, penalty and punishment for our sin so that God could freely offer us salvation from our sin (Isaiah 53:3-5). “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16).   that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved (Romans 10:9)  God does not hold the wrong things you’ve done in the past against you when you recieve salvation. You only need Jesus to be saved and set free! Right now, you can make a decision to receive Jesus into your life by following these steps:  1. Believe that Jesus is the Son of God and that He was raised from the dead.  2. Accept Jesus as your Savior and proclaim Him Lord of your life.  If you desire to do this right now, pray the following prayer out loud and mean it with all of your heart and live out your new life in Christ:  “Heavenly Father, I come to You in the Name of Jesus. Your Word says, 'Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved' (Acts 2:21). I am calling on You.  “I pray and ask Jesus to come into my heart and be Lord over my life according to Romans 10:9-10: ‘If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by confessing with your mouth that you are saved.' 'I do that now. I confess that Jesus is Lord, and I believe in my heart that God raised Him from the dead.  I give you full control of my life. Let only your will be done in my life, thank you for saving me. I receive the Holy Spirit, Come live in me, Seal me, in the name of Jesus!   “I am now reborn!  I am a Christian—a child of Almighty God! Jesus is the Lord and savior of my life, I am saved, AMEN!” . You need to grow in Relationship with Jesus! don't just pray a prayer and live as you used to, Get baptised, Read the Bible starting in John, and follow Jesus not the world! Heaven and Earth will pass away but the Word will never pass, Follow Jesus through it all! He is coming very soon so live like He will come tomorrow, because He might!  Checkout this playlist on Repentance!  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYXS_Gos0O4vbNYzkRjOHGeWUyr01we3l

Kasoo in the cut free the drillman
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Bro I miss king Von y’all the best rappers ever I love you guys LLKV🕊🥺💕🙏🏽

I’m glad to see von again in a new music video it’s like he never left :/ LLKV😞
Von so hard
Q peddled more than a few falsehoods. Be that as it may, some of what he claimed is genuinely accurate to reality. If you honestly believe that satanic practices are in no way being followed by the elite, well then you are lost. You've been hoodwinked, my friends. The evidence is out there. Countless individuals who try to fully expose the truth are silenced, denounced, branded delusional dingbats, or murdered. Some of those who speak out have extremely credible accounts of treachery. The globalists' form of professional gaslighting fuels plausible deniability so that no people who actively seek to spread truth are taken seriously. The perfect deflection to keep humans off the trail of what is actually reoccurring all over the planet. The mainstream media circuit yields no scientific proof that masks even work, despite the claims to the contrary. They lack any valid substance to speak of on many pertinent matters. Do you really think anybody can 100% verify what is actually happening behind closed doors? Nothing appears completely trustworthy in this world. It all comes down to what you believe is most likely true from the limited evidence we do have access to. Time to wake up, brothers and sisters. God bless and good luck to you.

why this video made me shed  tear RIP Von
1:22 to 2:02 straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥  King Von is spitting FACTS 💯
10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. I used to have an open mind but my brains kept falling out. 2. Energizer Bunny arrested; charged with battery. 3. Time is what keeps things from happening all at once. 4. Lottery: A tax on people who are bad at math. 5. I didn't fight my way to the top of the food chain to be a vegetarian.  6. If at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried. 7. Always remember that you are unique; just like everyone else. 8. National Atheist's Day April 1st. 9. All generalizations are false. 10. The more people I meet, the more I like my dog.  Editorial: Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.

Ain't the same without V.Roy😕
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)'

Dude, awesome 🔥
Von! RIP🕊
But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.” John 11:10
yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. James 4:14
And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.  For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.  But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.” John 3:19‭-‬21
The song was recorded before von died. This the original video he borrowed lil durk OTF chain for to put on the car along with the others. Durk recorded his video after Von’s death, he probably wasn’t gonna be in it at first due to their case.
Man rip I got goosebumps
Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret. But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible, for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says,  “Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.” Ephesians 5:11‭-‬14
R.I.P Von ❤️🙏😭

Damn this shit breaks my heart💔 the emotions on vons face jus hit different now. I feel like I personally knew this man. R. I.P homie💯
Durks verse goes hard asf💯
Warning; Here is how it will play out  1. If Jesus Christ comes back to take his church and found you not saved (not believing at him as the savior through believing he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and that he risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now) you will be left behind and there will be great tribulation you will suffer on earth and that will be God's judgement.  The only way to be saved at tribulation after left behind by Jesus when majority of Christians have disappeared is to not take the mark of the beast on your forehead or right hand and you will be killed or starve to death.  2. Death always occur you can die at any time and the huge issue is if you die before Christ returns and you were not believing at him as the savior( that is not believing at Christ that he was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and risen again on the third) your soul will go straight to Hell for eternity, at Hell you will burn but not consumed.  Realise that you deserve hell for your sins;  Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH. In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit. They disobeyed God, but didn't DIE physically until hundreds of years later. Why? It's because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12). Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are not the same. Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead. The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15). All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at The Great White Throne of Judgment and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.   Believing at Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It's only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins. It's your choice but know that rejecting Christ will send you the wrong direction.  Hebrews 10:4, 10 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.   Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can't save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.  No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that.   Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.  Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now.   After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.   Romans 6:12-13 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.  As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.  Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag..

Durks verse the best  . Still the goat. Vroy second that. I wish he had calmed down he’d still be here . Very sad n disheartening how he gone over foolishness that cuda been avoided. Just threw to the wind n ended everything he’s worked so hard for. Just mad not even thinking how how far he’s come from where he started. Not even thinking about his kids no matter the outcome Danm! It wasn’t suppose to end like this.  I wish he had survived it in some form so he cud see n learn from his reckless act...get his ass cursed out by we for scarring the S** outta us  n prolly get his ass whooped by his mama n his lady for givin em a heart attack playing with his life like that n tryna throw it away over nothing. But I guess it life never plays out how we plead it to. This is why we need to watch n pray cos this devil! When he decides to strike.. we never see it coming n it’s outcome is always overly grievous. Von got The ultimate punishment Death! Irreversible! Sigh #RIPVRoy. U left us 💔

Von the goat
Rip vroy i wish u was still here
Damn yo it feels like von faked his death  I miss him
I like this video lil durk
Something about this video don’t seem right fr like the look in vons eyes something tells me he knew something shit!
No my opinion please respect it I think he did so sacrificed king von because king von was sneak dissing his cousin in songs plus fbg duck mom said he did.and plus the day he was shot he was set up by lil durk.And plus if he wasn’t sacrificed why did he release the song back in blood after he died and not before...? Answer that  please oh yes plus if he did not why would he say in the song he was dissing on my cousin now he in the woods huh.? Plus when he said that he was pointing up at the sky and dint forget that they were saying von was sneak Dissing his cousin.check the lyrics and watch the video u would understand what I’m talking about.Plus.  69 was talking a whole bunch of crap but lil durk still ain’t do nothin plus quando rondo brother who is lul Tim is still alive THAT MEANS THEY WERE WORKING TOGETHER plus on the livestream when von got shot why would he go on live and start smiling yall can look at the live then when ppl was saying von was shot he was still signing then at the last minute he ended the live.and plus durk prolly sacrificed king von to avoid jail time see it’s a agenda that’s why u can’t trust ppl it be the closest ppl u be with see imma expose stuff.and why would u think he would make a song with drake just think 🤔 of it.......rip king 👑 von fly high 🕊 you will be miss 😢.that’s really crazy von treated durk like a brother he wasn’t rude or disrespectful to him but it ended up to this that’s crazy. Cause look if von wasn’t set up would durk had went with von to the club...?and in the song when durk said why would u go outside without ur gun then he said dummy don’t forget he relased that song with Pooh shiesty it’s called should of ducked cause if he not talking about king von why would he released these songs after he die.....? Seee nobody can’t answer.oh yea and one mo thing in the song durk had said how would you love a n***ga with only a lil bit of clout that’s a shame on n***ga he said that line in the song  called all these niggas if you dint BELIVE me go check out the song and listen to the lyrics.Plus ppl were saying durk career was dying that’s why he sacrificed king von so he can get more attention plus when he made that song called Kanye crazy..I just exposed half of the rap industry plus even 69 did to cause he is apart of the industry.
Mane RIP Von mane this shit brazy 🤦🏽‍♂️ shit don’t make no sense shit go dumb no bap
this song is so ass
Yessir 😈😈😈🔥🔥🔥
We all just need to win
Can someone pls explain to me why y’all think Durk sacrificed Von?

Vonnnnnnn 😍!!!!! 😪!
How many music videos did Von even record before he died, we have gotten like 10 music videos with Von ACTUALLY in them released after he passed away I hope he has a lot more that he recorded before he passed, life is crazy man
Von Dead and he still better than these weak rappers that diss him
Tried to force myself to wait and watch 😢 LLKV
Just a reminder Von got his masters that means his family gets all his money he makes off of sales and streams so lets run his numbers up regardless if people say he is "overrated" from how much we run his numbers up he is gonna get haters regardless Von didn't  get the attention he deserved when he was alive so lets run his numbers up for him and his family, so lets tun Von's numbers up like what we did with Pop Smoke
He even say durk snitching in this one ☝️ he had a case his bond on hold wow 🤩 he think he slick I know he told 🎱
Long live von he was nigga 💯💯

Von said “These n!ggas h0es, you know I know, he think he slick, I know he told” he was talking about durk! Listen to “King Von - Why He Told” Den Quando Rondo made a song 3days ago saying “in this industry to get some mills, you gotta kill your brother, But I’m way too solid for real to sacrifice my own” DURK SACRIFICED KING VON!!! OPEN YALL EYES

thats a crazy FL & Chi connection. KSOO opps are Foolio & Poody.  Hottboii N Poody is homies. Von & Durk fuck with Hottboii but Booka600 & Memo600 clearly fuck with Ksoo ATK. Since KSOO are homies Ace. n ACE & GlockNine cool. n Glocknine & Hottboii is shooting it out in orlando.  I guess as long as you dont live in the same state, you dont care about who is opps
“If you get caught you bet not fold.”
Them PERCS really will ruin your life. Like Durk said
it still hurt to see von gone ;(

That von comment gonna make me cry
I get absolute chills when Von verse come on bro, this shit don't even feel real </3
LLKV
Love to see it all🥰🥰
Von dissed durks  cussn lil Mista because durk snitched. Durk wasnt haven that so he offed Von and sacrificed em for clout. Everytime someone dies around durk he goes higher onna bracket in fame. Now durk is using his name and lyrics for clout open your eyes it’s not a coincidence the lyrics tell it all went in Pooh shietsies video back in blood 🩸. “U can’t come back to yo hood huh ? He was dissen on my cousin now his ass all in that wood huh ?!!” Not even a day before Von died.
Y’all see KSO ina cut😈
Im sorry durk but this von song now
💲💥💥💣🤘💲
Von basically saying his folks watched him die and the ops outside now not hiding. And how durk folding on him in court. Listen to the lyrics. He telling us on a song with durk bitchass on it. Obviously by the hoodie he had on von even said durk dont even have the official otf merch. Durk didnt like that. This was before they had to be apart from eachother. Hmm let that sink in
No cap lil Durk I fuck miss King Von I can’t sleep at night I miss that nigga
Nigga Said”  Its Still A FEW Hittas From The 6 “ They Either Dead In Jail Smh
