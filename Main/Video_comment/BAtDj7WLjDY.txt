Ryan George has this genre of comedy locked
Damn that's a big woman
0:22 - you know, suddenly I understand why anime does so many flashbacks
Wowza!!! So good it actually hurts!
The happy ending bit made me think of the eternal flames ending and everyone should understand that reference
I had no idea i had to watch Boba Fett before this. I'm still glad i didn't.
RIP Intern Guy. 2023-2023
I despise the "random side activity with kid who only has plot armour because he is a kid" slop trope.
This Is The Way
i don't know how I missed this one 2 years ago but the side quest was hilarious!
Legit funniest guy on YT
Anybody else realize that they didn't mention Bo Katan even once
I didn't know I clicked on the side quest video. Not a season 3 Madilorian video... lol
"So what's the deal with your intern?" "Don't worry about that, we're never gonna see him again. Hey intern! You're fired because you took too long!"
Intern sequel story please
Brutal
love de side quest here... tight
There is no way anyone could pull up Lizzo out of anything with one hand. Your need an industrial crane for that much weight.
THANK YOU, DADDY-O!
Ryan George: I cannot emphasize enough how people will never get interested in [Star Wars]  Kathleen Kennedy: Actually it's gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience
Wow, I feel like I'm watching a disney program right now! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Good thing I never watched this trash. I knew after season 2 it was probably going to be pretty bad. Good thing missing it is barely an inconvenience.
Im gonna need you to get all the way off my back about the spin offs these interns deserve for some reason i decided.
Lmao this is amazing.
Im glad I watched the Pitch Meeting Christmas Special, otherwise I wouldve never known why Producer Guys Coffeecup is white (SPOILER: Its because of what happened in Pitch Meeting Episode 379, Season 52).
I must be the only person that liked season 3, and im unapologetic about it. I don't care. I enjoyed it
I'm so glad you went so far with the intern story. Fantastic decision. I only wish it went even further.
Wait I just realized the point of the whole coffee quest thing was to prove the point that side quests about useless side characters are annoying and no one wants to see that 😂. Yet this side quest was funny and worth watching lol
I dont think we're ever getting Andor because there's not a lot dumb things in that show to make fun of in these.
I have criticisms about this Pitch Meeting as he says that thing about the child getting eaten but doesn't clarify that the child was saved despite this and I feel that would have been worth mentioning and I also think it's dumb that Ryan implied Moff Gideon returning was random even though he was rescued by Imperial's I can't remember if it was another episode of season 3 or a different show but I know it was one of them so I think it's dumb that he acted like Moff Gideon returning was out of nowhere but overall good Pitch Meeting
But who got to keep the turds?
That was a sink plunger, using a toilet plunger would work better
He fired the internet guy :(
I love that you haven't done Andor... throwing any shade at that show would alot tougher to do in my opinion (but I still challenge you, none the less. :D)
Why was screenwriter guy even talking to him before he had had his coffee?
No Mr. Meeting, thank YOU for saving me the hassle of watching the season.  Can't wait for season 2 of Andor though...
Ahhh, these are the interns that will take over after today's episode 400... nice.
This video just shows what a comedic genius Ryan is. The intern side plot was perfection 😙🤌
o7 to the intern we will never see again
u son of a b^&*@ that long side quest was funny as hell ahahha
Ryan I hope you realize that people know now want intern guy to get his own show.
I never finished season 3…..got to that lizzo Jack black episode and tapped out
I love hitting buttons; hitting buttons is tight.
2:22 Real ones remember the  Salish-Shidhe from Shadowrun on Genesis
Christopher lloyd looked defeated lol
Disney forcing their Democrat actors into everything is tight!
That side quest really made a point.
We need more Assistant Guy!  What's his story? What are his hopes?  His dreams?
Side quests are tight
okay. i been very patient. when is the full length movie about the coffee intern happening?
Hey Disney, some asshole on Youtube, made your show, with better writing, effects and characters.
And this is why so many people hate disney as a company
Somehow Palpatine returned.
The thing I like the least is how Mando (and Boba Fett) were saved over and over again by outside intervention. It seemed to downgrade the heroes; which is standard Disney fare any more.
God I hope real producer guys at Disney watch this channel
I'd like to see the "actor-name-hat" in every pitch featuring actors for seemingly no good reason. Be it wrong actor choices, nonsensical cameo's, do-nothing cameo's etc. Also with the same childlike glee of pulling names.
Epic
I literally watched the intern story all the way through just to prove a point. 😂
I just found bo katan so blah that I couldn't be invested in her storyline and s3 was basically all about her storyline. She's not as annoying as Sabine from Ashoka by selling out a whole galaxy for one dude, but she was still smug and aggravating. And then you find out she basically surrendered mandalore in a failed attempt for peace and gave gideon the darksaber, and everyone (including those who were stuck on the planet and who said they "knew she would never surrender" just seconds earlier) just forgave her for it and didn't have any issue.  S2 ended so well that I felt it kinda wrapped up Mando's story and quest perfectly, he was sad to say goodbye but grogu being with Luke was a great idea. I like grogu with Mando as a duo but them reuniting felt like it undid Mando's entire main objective from the first two seasons.   If they were gonna reunite, I wish s3 focused on grogu training with Luke and coming to realize he missed Mando and wanted to be mandalorian too, choosing the armor over the lightsaber, then they reunite and take down Gideon. No need for him to be in boba fett's show. No need to focus on bo katan, her group of mandalorians, or her becoming the leader of mandalore again.   The mandalorian was such a good show for the first two seasons because it was quite character-driven with personal stakes, mainly focused on din djarin and grogu and shown through their lens. Mando was so charismatic and entertaining, and his small covert was interesting. I wish they kept what made the first two seasons great and didn't suddenly force Mando to take a backseat to side characters.   I also felt like the story felt like it wasnt going anywhere until the last 2 episodes. Like they wanted to retake mandalore but it was so dragged out. Pacing aeems to ve a problem with a lot of these shows. Boba fett was oddly paced, both dragging and skipping over stuff by rushing certain points simultaneously, ahsoka could've been half the length it was, solo was slow paced, it's just weird. I know some recent marvel content struggles with pacing too though, especially the shows.
Is it just me or is this one of his funniest yet?
1) I absolutely agree that ep 3 wasn't a "Mandalorean" epeisode,  and 100% agree that the "Boba Fett" series was hijacked...but I really like how the stories are tied together.  Y'all haters feel free to hate,  I'll re-watch this shizz 1,000 times more than "Rise of Skywalker"
Now hear me out I don't think the clone destruction button is stupid. I've seen enough evil clone shows that I think it was actually really smart to have a bit of a failsafe if his force clones woke up evil. Although if they did he wouldn't have much time to push the button so he should probably have a remote and the kill switch should be an implant. I was literally asking my mom why would the clones listen to him if he's weaker. I know that they're supposed to have some sort of obedience chip or whatever but they aren't normal people there's really no assurance nothing will go wrong.
The bit where the intern had to drive to get to the shop struck me as a full force "America is different" moment.
Lucasfilm now has developed the mentality of making a project that assumes the viewer has seen the spinoffs
The Intern side quest was better than the entire season of The Acolyte.
03:20 You just had to sneak in an "it is, isn't it?" You did, didn't you?
I love that the stock footage montage of the car journey went from 'Average American Intersection' in one scene to 'Random Road way out in the middle of the Japanese Countryside' in the next XD
Intern Sidequests and sequels are  tight!!!
That was a plunger for a sink not a toilet😂
0:10 this bullshit right here is why i stopped watching the MCU and never bothered with the starwars shows
😂😂😂😂😂
The Lizzo/Jack Black cameo made it feel like a high budget snl sketch, and not in a good way
2:39 the commitment to this bit is sublime. And so rewarding. Haha
Wow, really went for the production value on this episode!
Pitch meeting and Ryan George collab?!! I'm down for it
My favorite line: “Well ok then.” With that classic squint.
When they were doing the thing where they drew random names out of a hat, after Jack Black, the next name was Lizzo, and I assumed that was going to be, like, the weird alien pet that Jack Black's character would have. No, apparently that's the actual name of a human celebrity? Whom I've never heard of in any capacity and have no idea why she's a celebrity or why she's named what any 6-year-old would name their pet lizard. Okay then.
Isn't the macguffin chase the staple of all Disney shows while rarely moving the plot forward.
Didn't even realize that was Lizzo.
And they brought back IG-11... but he's IG-12 now! Other than that he's the exact same character, serves no plot purpose and ruins his sacrifice in Season 1. Truly the TV show writing ever
When will intern guy be getting his own series?
Saying “is tight” is TIGHT!!
One of the best side quest episodes, I like more of these wired side quests
This pitch meeting has more hurtful jab than the amount of vaccine available for HPV.
Pascal wasn’t even there 😮
5:15 "Oh, a clone of myself." - Shadow The Hedgehog
I feel like that "we're Disney, watch everything we make or else" was more than just an idle threat 😂
Looking forward to Writer Guy's 2-episode mini arc in Intern Guy's spin-off show
In the words of the based Joker, "you get what you deserve, Disney." Brilliant flex there with the intern bit.
I honestly thought Christopher Lloyd had died several years ago.  Like a Mandela effect
In 30 years there'll be a whole series of Pitch Meeting dedicated to Intern's backstory
Did he get the creamer??!! 😮😮🎉🎉
if you wanna see more of the Intern Guy you'll have to tune in to Season 8 of The Place Where Words for Things are Decided, only on SuperEasy+ ✨✨✨✨
This had me.laughing so hard
If not for the hat, part of me wonders if Disney DOES have a little book they open up to see who they can blackmail to appear in their latest crap.
Just coming back here to say we need to see the intern return in future pitch meetings. Please
Am I the only one who has no idea who lizzo is?
The Intern: Turdinator, Part III - Flush With Success  I can't wait for the next 23 movies in the Intern Universe
lizz0/Jack Black total shit. doc always is great ofc.
the show ended perfectly on season 2, why continue???
another funny one
Can we get a series about the interns?
I lost interest halfway through season 2 and that appears to be a solid decision on my behalf. Super disappointed in the whole show.
jack black being in Mandalorian kinda ruined it, it no longer felt like it was "a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away"
That quest music is so Mandolorian! Brought me right back.
🎉
I would have really liked the 3rd season if this was the original plan for it. But it wasn't and a great show with outstanding creatures will be forgotten in horrible story telling.
Side quests are tight, and that one was barely an inconvenience.
Just finished Season 2  and started Season 3 and I was very confused. Why is Grogu back? Where did this sleek new ship come from? Main characters also asked the same questions and we were both meet with a brief non-committal non-answer. When they started on the quest bring back IG-11 and undo his heroic death I just thought they were dismantling all the major plot points from the previous season, didn't know was covered to some degree elsewhere.  Also the "This is the way" joke still got me.
Star Wars bad guys love somehow returning
Pitch Meeting helps me remember I am not insane, it is the world that has gone mad.  Every time I watch these shows I think the exact same stuff is stupid as Pitch Meeting does.  My God, how do they keep getting away with this?  How does The Mandalorian get away with half of each season being filler episodes?  Why can't they come up with a plot where they don't have to do that?!  It's not that hard!  You get to decide what the plot is as the writer!  WHAT IS HAPPENING
HTF does he eat with a bucket on his head?
In this trainwreck of a season, those minor characters offered way more interesting Star Wars content then the main ones did. Won't comment on Jack Black and lizzo's cameos or YT will censor me (again).
That's a really dedicated Intern guy Such a lovable Character
Pull another name out! (The capoeira bad guy from tony jaa's the protector is usually in the Mando armor)
If Jack Black burns enough bridges, maybe some day we get a sequel to Brutal Legend?
The other thing i dont understand is the new republic is basically the same as the empire andthe fact thay the brainwashed one of the greatest scientific minds of their times is pretty much empire.... it was soo bad....😊
IM LOVING THE SIDE QUEST
Ryan George's own channel is crossing over with Pitch Meeting!
I have been so happy since pitch meeting exited the evil screen rant universe and is now in its own epic awesome pitch meeting universe!
1:30 in their defense there are several ep of batman where we follow Someone else before batman shows up in the ep.
Super Easy, Barley an inconvenience! 😜
It took me way too long to figure out that the whole intern side plot was making fun of the show itself.
Why is it I don't remember the intern scene? I've watched all pitch meetings over dozens of times and do not at all for the life of me remember that bit.
“Starwars bad guys love somehow returning” such an incredible line!
Love the cash register guy’s crooked moustache 😂😂😂
See, you should have fully committed and never went back to the pitch and producer guys.  Just end the skit with the intern story.  ;)  Conversely, I'm sure we ALL appreciate that you didn't commit on a realistically clogged toilet.
Having Grogu back at the start of season 3 with no explanation was such a slap in the face, immediately killed my interest and I loved seasons 1 and 2. Why would I need to watch another show and a half to know what’s happening in this one?! Ridiculous.
Defo the worst season by far. Fuck Lizzo and Jack Black is overrated.
Any chance that we can see more of those interns, again, at some point in the future?
Explaining your entire plan only after it fails actually does make sense.
I think you missed the other parts too, "we're Disney you have to watch every movie, every tv show, every animated series, read every book, every comic, every podcast, every message from a messenger pigeon, every pamphlet from our in person booth at *insert random expo* to fully understand the series you're a fan of."
I'm so glad I gave up on Disney's Star Wars after the first season of The Mandalorian.
Not one of the Star Wars spinoffs even the holiday special has been worth a crap
Wait what? Mando and Grogu re-unite in another show?! HNGGGGG!!!!
Trying to give 3 likes google won't let me
Almost thought I stumbled into an outback car commercial
This pitch meeting reinforces my decision to stop watching after season 1.
Gina Carano was carrying a lot of weight in the show. Ever since she left it really just took a dump. Pedro should reach out to her for some help with his bad acting.
Disney needs more intern guy side quests
I get the feeling the “toilet being all clogged up with turds” is a metaphor for something…
I know Jack Black  and Christopher Lloyd but who is Lizzo?  It doesn't really matter.  I don't watch the Mandalorian for  Jack Black or Christopher Lloyd.  Actually I don't watch the show at all.
Reminding me of some of the worst cameos in film history…you tried to make it funny Ryan…you tried…
To like this video, you have to go on a quest with the mouse to exit full screen. Then, you have to go on a perilous journey with the mouse to finally make it to the like button, then you will like it. This will take 50 minutes. THIS IS THE WAY
Disney:  It appears we have a spy in our midst. Leaking all our secrets. Oh well who cares.
I'd watch an entire series about intern guy before I ever watch anything Disney makes.
This stuff is really hilarious. That`s a rotund mockery.
Sir. I want to shake your hand and sincerely thank you.  That meta humor with the intern. Holy. Shit. Brilliant.  So. Good.  I wish I could upvote you more than once.
I was kind of disappointed when the Producer drank his coffee and it wasn't revealed that the intern did actually end up mistaking turds for creamer. Or maybe he did? Please stand by ....
That is your best one 😂
"Star Wars badguys love somehow returning"
I loved the shop owner character
Honestly... I gave up in Mando after they revealed he wasn't Boba Fett trying to get his armor back and the story became all about baby Yoda... I feel this Pitch Meeting was a more enjoyable way of finding out how the show ended then actually watching it.
The intern side quest was B-roll from Hyundai, wasn't it?
That side quest was a fresh twist to the pitch meeting format and really hilarious 😂 great job Ryan!
5:22 I think it was the idea of Doofenschmirtz. He probably also somehow returned.
I didn’t know there was a season 3 of the mandalorian
so, when is the intern's spinoff show coming out?
Disney Star Wars materiel is so worthless I don't even bother trying to find pirated versions.  I loved Star Wars as a kid.  Disney ruined it.
Can we get more backstory on where the cream was made? Maybe follow the ranch hands
That sidestory caught me off guard.
The side quest is tight..
I love how the Mandalorian Pitch Meetings pretty much take time away from the plot to focus on random side quests from different characters.
SIDE QUEEEEEEEST 🤣
"Will accept turds as payment, what?... will accept cream as payment"
I can't wait for the Baby Yoda movie.
I really think these pitch meetings are better than the content being pitched.
I don't know why, but anything jack black is in now that isn't kung fu panda gives me pause. I don't understand why his schtick is so in demand.
wide were the first two seasons were so good and the season so bad?
I also really really wanted mando to take his helmet off at the end. Thought for sure he was going to.
You too… I mean you’re brilliant
Watch everything we do or else😂
Every second of this is pure perfection. Unlike the mandalorian season 3
Great Pitch Meeting about a great show. The Mandalorian is the best thing that Disney has produced since Dinosaurs and the best Star Wars related show or film since Return Of The Jedi. It does have it's problems though and you mocked them well here. I just wish that Disney would stop being such assholes and start releasing this stuff on physical media. People would buy it, I know I would...but there's no way that they'll get me to pay a monthly fee to subscribe to Disney+. Also, there's so many options for cool looking box sets. They could do a season where it's The Mandalorian's helmet, another where the discs are stored inside a Grogu doll, etc.
Important baths are TIGHT.   LOL
Great one!!!✌❤🤘
The problem with all Disney properties is that they’re too lucrative to let major changes happen so they become stale  Like once you accept that marvel characters will never die unless the actor quits or dies in real life, and same for Star Wars, it just becomes boring because there are zero stakes
I appreciate the commitment to the bit
lmao this was the last star wars shit i watched and this pitch meeting covers why perfectly
Intern side quest!!!!
Genius!
I dream of a movie with a plot so intricately exciting that ryan cannot say "super easy, barely an inconvenience "
Disney's false advertising strategy: Naming the show A only to give most of the screentime to B,C,D characters
I feel like the intern side quest deserves its own spin-off
I'm still 100% on board with Mandalorian Season 3. But I will admit I hope it doesn't get worse. While I don't think a lot of it was bad, even stuff people were whining about, I can see the cracks beginning to form and we don't need another "return to form" for Disney Star Wars content, where everything sucks and no one is competent at their job anymore. Obi-Wan was a huge mess and kinda hard to rewatch and the Book of Boba Fett, I didn't even feel like rewatching it when I revisited the Mandalorian's first two seasons before watching season 3.
I love coming across pitch meetings for movies and tv shows that I forgot existed
Thank You so much for calling out Disney. Not having the main characters be the main characters in their own show. I appreciate you so much for that
Hahahaha well played 😂
MAN... I love you... god dam laughing my ass off!
Where is season 2??? So sad that the middle season doesn’t exist
Not interested AT ALL in watching the Bo Katan show when it's supposed to be The Mandalorian. Din Djarin as a guest on his own show = BULLSHIT.
love the pay me in turds line....more memorable than any line from any new Star Wars movies / TV series. Someone pointed out that the most memorable movies have repeatable lines.... "this is the way" is it.....until "pay me in turds (or is it terds?)" came along!!
Wait, how did they have the budget for FIVE totally distinct characters played by five totally distinct actors?! 😱
I didn’t watch Boba Fett and was extremely confused at the start to the season lol
We will never see him again.. what about when sugar is needed?
Coming soon: THE INTERN CHRONICLES!
Making fun of a thing by doing the thing IS TIGHT!
the smallest part Jack Black has played since he was in Demolition Man
0:09 are.... are you serious?! That bugged me the whole season and now I found out, in Pitch Meeting no less, that I had to watch another show to know what the hell happened?! I really hate this season.
lol you are amazing thank you ❤😂
The side quest had me literally laughing out loud on the train. Thanks for that.
Disney sucks 😂
2:40 i was getting some 15 year old faux car commercial jump scare flashbacks
oh man i sure hope they make a pitch meeting spinoff show about producer guy's intern  additionally i hope a few episodes of that show are just pitch meeting episodes with almost not mention of producer guy's intern
LMAO
Okay I get the point BUT can the intern please get a spinoff at least? 😂
You’re over exaggerating this! Where does it say in the title this show is about The Mandalorian?!
You’re a genius, bro…
Star Wars is dumb as hell and needs to stop. The fact they're casting trash like Lizzo says it all.
Oh god, that intern sidequest is genuinely the hardest I've laughed in years.  Thank you so much, now my head hurts.
That intern bit had me DYING!
Jokes on you, Ryan, we click on these videos to get our fix on the Ryanverse. Side quests where we still get to see the lead actor is Tight!
not me going "What the f*** is all of this?" Halfway, followed instantly by a "ooooh.... that's what he meant" and I laughed at myself.
Accepting turds as payment is tight
So in the Mandalorian...there are 3 things that were set up to be important. 1)Baby Yoda has to get to Luke. 2)You can't take off your helmet if you're a Mando for religious reasons and 3) the black sword is very powerful and won't just break or something.  Baby Yoda decides not to train with Luke, some girl can be a mando even while not wearing the helmet and the black sword cracks during battle, and quickly. They set us up and utterly wasted our time.
Ryan? Um... where's the store with the cream located? Ok, I know its in Quebec, but I swear I saw Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman standing in that field.  BTW - Kevin Spacey was judged to be innocent. Not guilty. He didn't do anything illegal. In the movie Se7en he definitely did illegal stuff. I mean in real life he is innocent.
Mando 3 was mind-numbingly terrible. Just aweful. The pitch meeeting however was absotuley brilliant. Cheers
The Meta-lorian
I'm now more interested in the pitch meetings for Star Wars shows than the shows themselves.  By the way, could we get spinoff Pitch Meetings for both the cashier and the intern?
"it's taking him a while" "It IS, isn't it!?"   I laughed so hard. 😂
I can’t wait for mando season 4 for more intern guy
Hey, I came here for a coffee run, what is this pitch meeting nonsense about some kinda chandelier?
But wait, how did that guy's toilet get clogged in the first place?  I smell a new series on D+ !
The intern gig was great. I hated it.
Mando has become another Dis-Dumpster fire..
Brilliant video
I love that you so perfectly encapsulate your prey that not only do I not have to watch it,  but l don't even have to know what it's about to get a good belly-laugh out of it 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Request: Dr. Strangelove!
The glance down st the script ctfu like the answers are actually in there
The strectched out side quest with the intern, side character, was brilliant 😂
Intern guys side story is the funniest bit you’ve done with pitch meeting, laughed so hard when he got dismissed, like to bring back intern guy!
Ok that's just over kill lol. Internship is tight.
lol
It’s genius how he shows the slowness of the mandolorian side quests while making it funny
That was perfect
Who is this Amanda Lorien I keep hearing?
Well played Sir, well played! :D The side quests instead of the main character were brilliant! :D
It's disconcerrtkng to discover there's  a whole other reality outside Producer Guy's office.
To keep with the Mando theme, his wife should come and finish the episode for him.
This was a much a longer one that this Pitch Meeting needed to be.  Good job.
I would to see more intern guy that was way better than anything Disney Star Wars did
Thank you, for the most ironic mise en abyme of 2023! 😂👍🎉 That Non-Mandalorian pitch meeting was so tight !
Well, this was it - the episode that finally forced me to subscribe! This was just too good. Absolutely excellent.... No notes!
Brilliant satire.   Like all things Disney, this show just fell off a cliff.
This is one of the best
Star Wars is an anime now.... Somehow Palpatine returned, somehow Moff Gideon returned, somehow Dio Brando returned, somehow Frieza returned again, .....
Would have been great if he made this a three part episode and legit made it a whole episode of the side quest
LMAO I'm rewatching it rn and that one episode where Dr pershing gets set up by Gideons bitch- at the end he's all tied down about to get mind flayed and screams "IT WAS A TRAP" and the mon cal looks up like "hey arn't I suppose to say that?" 😂😂😂😂
I love how you just tear these shows apart. This is the way.
Always in the Mandalorian pitch meetings - there's some random funny part unrelated to it.
I honestly hope that this season was a wake up call for Lucasfilm that they actually needed to put work and effort into their projects if they wanted them to be successful  It's a long shot, but I have to hold onto something
This is so good, I was laughing the whole time. The music during the car drive. "It's taking him a while, isn't it?" 😂😂
It took me a little bit to pick up on the intern joke but as soon as I got it I really appreciated that.
PUT A CHICK IN IT AND MAKE HER GAY!!!!
Saved me from having to watch this booooring season. Ironically, I liked the "side quest" (with Dr. Pershing) the most. That at least seems to be setting up a plot thread that will go somewhere in the Thrawn direction.
I see a missed opportunity for a Car  Brand placement here 🤣
Intern storyline😂😂😂
I would absolutely watch an entire series on producer guy's assistant
I'm hung up on the dirty wall next to the toilet
Main characters be the main characters. lmao, apt scene.  Also, I am disappointed they literally threw away all the interesting points from the conclusion of season 2. Very Disney though (to not have a planned out and coherent plot across multiple instances of time).  The Grogu thing is at least slightly more sensible than Gamorrah reappearing then not having anything to do with Anything, other than to tell Star Lord "you need therapy and self growth" like it's a satisfying conclusion or something.🤦‍♀️
Lizzo. I fucking kidding me wow
Liiizzooooo!!!! Also who the hell is Lizzo?
dairy industry product placements equals several coffee industry product placements equal several  How the game is played.
Loved the intern side quest!
Getting creamer is super easy, barely an in convenience
the intern needs his own channel
the fact your intern had a more relevant side story than the mandalorian is insane
"Maybe we should let the main characters be the focus of their own show" Yeah that was my problem with Boba Fett and this season. Ashoka was a little better but it had it's own problem.
I want to know more about the interns, and Sam. Tell me more about them.
And we never saw the intern again.
The Grogu thing was all Kathleen Kennedy and Jon Faveau (the writer) almost left over it …. so you know he almost has integrity!
This is gold😂
The worst part is that this probably was the state of the writers room.
-dying of laughter- That's EXACTLY how it felt! That coffee creamer run!!! I just can't...I can't...
@2:35 that car is literally being advertised right under your video.. Batman tried to warn us about the Gov having access to all our phones.🤷‍♂️.. I see so many ads pop up from actual conversations i have with friends now.. Our constitution is heavily under attack from all this new technology 💯💯💯
this is brilliant
2:20 LOL
Ryan, you are a gift to us all.
What about the finale where the heroes flew right past a ton of Imperial fighters without trouble, and rather than the fighters coming back to attack them, they disappeared without explanation?
Why is the intern side quest more entertaining than Disneys and it’s just a guy getting coffee creamer
"Maybe we should have the main characters be the main characters in their shows" me after finishing the new ashoka sh9w
I'm thankful that Disney produced the Mandalorian Season 3, because that caused us to be able to enjoy this Pitch Meeting.
Pacing seems to be a serious issue in Star Wars live action shows in general. This, Ahsoka, and Obi-Wan all should've been less episodes or just made into a movie. I think it's time Disney accepts this.
ok is it just me or this is the FIRST TIME EVER we actually see outside the office of this show?
Glad I never watched it.  I just love how modern crap wars rips from the old EU that was so much better. Like Luke being a badass instead of how they did him in the movies..
This channel gives purpose to all the bad movies and shows ❤
This show has to be the biggest corporate cash grab of all time. Every episode they just give the audience some sort of nostalgia and go on a random generic mission with no real storyline. It seriously felt like there was a cookie cutter mold because every episode went exactly the same way
Disney....please...please stop making utter putrid garbage.  Is that too much to ask?
love how the show is such shit. That they literately spend half the run time on a stupid intern skit instead of talking about the show.
Wait! I want to see more about the intern! 🤟🏻😂
Star Wars bad guys love somehow returning.  Nice little dig there, love it
that intern bit was hilarious. I was laughing out loud the whole time
Ah the old bait and switcharoo,  Ryan J and Kewin smith shitty writting style. Bad times.
"IT IS ISN'T I-"
Episode 3 sucked ass. Like what was the point. Like it set up that that chick was a spy and a bunch of boring character development and then they leave the scientist with a weird ending..
Dude did you buy a drone and a car just to make a segment in a part of your pitch meeting... TIGHT
The Interns deserve their own show more than Disney nuWars deserves a single dollar.
All I kept thinking was, “Why is Lizzo wearing a bra on her head?”
The ironic part where the episode that didn't feature mando was probably the best written of the season. Almost as if a writer for Andor snuck into the writing room.
I did genuinely like the intrigue and worldbuilding of the Imperial scientist episode. I just wish it actually served the story in some way.
The internet side quest was so funny 😂 😂😂😂
Mando season 3 is the worst piece of Star Wars content I’ve ever watched
LOL. Absolutely brilliant!
You are absolutely hilarious bro....I'm dying once again
#BringBackIntern
I loved the little side quest with the intern! Is it just me or does anybody else feel like whenever somebody makes a great movie like Iron Man or Star Wars Hollywood just feels the need to make a Bajillion spin offs and sequels until it’s just not fun anymore?
Absolutely outstanding
No thanks, Ill just pay for the creamer with money.
Can't wait for the intern season 2!
Can you please do a pitch meeting for Andor?
Bro that whole side quest bit was brilliant!!  😂😂😂 I've never seen even 2 minutes of the MandaBullcrap series but i can tell it's annoying as 💩💩 having pointless dialogue and shots from 10 angles just to stretch the runtime 🤮🤮
This was brilliant
The Pitch Meeting was more interesting than some of the episodes this season of Mando.
Oh, so there are many producer guys. Now I understand the distinctions in their characters.
The "cream adventure" was more entertaining than the entire Mandalorian season 3.
Wait a sec. So Pedro Pascal is technically a voice actor and not the guy in the Mandalorian armor playing Mando? I've been bamboozled!!
Another perfect pitch meeting. Perfect perfection. Especially the side quest.
The flutes accompanying the side quest for cream were tight. Very Mando-esque.
I love all PM but this one … this one I’d marry
Why would you ever reach into a bag of names and pull out Lizzo
Asi es la Wea!
Use me as a Lizzo is terrible button
In all honestly, Mando 3 didn’t have the same hype Mando 1 did, I remember EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE talking about Mando 1, for Mando 3 I was the only one like “you seen Mando 3”
That was a lot better then Mandalorian season 3
Top pitch meeting!
Seems to be that the parodies of Hollywood are all 100% better than the so called "entertainment" Hollywood claims they make....
They focused WAY too much on Bo Katan.
Disney plus ad before the video
I really hate how they brought back Gideon and that he'll probably be in the next season as the main villain, first hes taken prisoner then he breaks out, and now he'll be a clone. 😴 How many times we gonna beat this guy?
The lack of actual story in a lot of streaming shows is a real problem.  They have a plot that would fill 3 or 4 episodes and then stretch it out to 8 to 10.. sometimes 13 episodes.  Here's a thought, do 3 or 4 episode arcs and do 2 or 3 different storylines in a season.  Fill it with actual plot and not filler.
I stopped watching the show after 3rd Episode of Season 1 just because of that stretching - seems not much has changed after that. Once again an awesome pitch meeting.
"Moff Gideon, how did you like the clone-inator I invented for you?" "It was great until someone hit the self-destruct button, Mr. Doofinschmirtz." "Why do I keep putting those on all my inators?"
Season 3 was a big disappointment not gonna lie. Not only was Mando treated terribly but he got his darksaber taken away. This season had many boring points and it dragged on. I am cool with Star Wars not being action all the time. I like the calm moments in the series. But stretching that boringness with adding nothing engaging is something I don’t want
Completely forgot about the Mando chick Kara Thrace who never wore her helmet. So Like Mandalorians just don't give a rip, right? Wasn't she the main character of S3?
The Mandalorian S3 absolutely deserved to be skewered by SR.
I was hoping for an intern battle
Excellent... very clever.
Not gonna lie.  I totally thought episode 7 was the last one of the season and that it ended on a cliffhanger.  I never watched episode 8 and it sounds like I didn't miss much.
did you get clips from a commercial...jeeeeezzz
The show was so mediocre that I forgot I didn't even watch the last 3 episodes and I thought I did lol
You roast Disney in such a wholesome and positive way.  Love it keep it up
All great points. Very well done. I still enjoyed the season. 🤷🏽‍♀️
One of the best pitch meetings of all time, this one was absolutely savage and super thorough. Easy 10/10.
"Unclear." really sums up season 3 on all levels.
You know, ive played solitaire on my phone for 24 hours strait and sometimes when i feel like that was a waste of time, i think of all the people who watch these shows and movies and dont feel so bad
thxagn
Never watched any of these `shows` but the pitch meetings are always entertaining.
I was excited for season 3, but damn
the last of us please
I love your pitch meeting shows
We will make it to 8😂😂😂
Apart from the BoBF/Stranger Things style story interruption, I actually enjoyed this season.  Nothing overly outstanding in terms of spectacle like the end of season 2, but still a good, solid, well-written season.
So spot on! As I watched your video, I kept remembering that I was thinking the same thing while watching The Mandalorian. While watching Joel tell Ellie to stay, I kept thinking that sounds just like Mando telling Grogu to stay.
Thank you Kathleen, for producing yet another woke piece of garbage. Where mando needs saving by the girls.
I hope it made you cry.
Epic - simply epic.... Interns are tight!
Here's the thing about the side episode with the people on Corasant though... it was the best episode.
And the writers association has the confidence to strike writting such shitty scripts.
This is my favorite pitch meeting. The intern part is genius
The intern quest is more enticing than the whole show and the music is so on point !!
"Maybe we should let the main characters be the main character in their own show. " (Witcher fans immediately break down in PTSD fueled sobbing)
Bro, loved the vid but def needs more intern
Side quests with minimal plot points are tight!
If only the executives and producwrs watched your videos, maybe they'd finally realize why they keep screwing up all this stuff!
That kid at 3:48 was wearing a helmet but otherwise wearing casual, non-armor clothes.  I guess that implication of "The Way" never occured to me, but I found it to be absurdly cartoonish.
Never seen the new season and idk how people did after the boba fett show got so bad and the mandalorion is just not the same show
Can the intern get his own show?
Was that...did intern guy travel all the way to Japan and then over to Ireland? WHERE IS THIS STORE THAT HE HAS TO GO TO??!
“IF…” *mustache back in place*
That Intern Guy looks related to that Producer Guy.
ayeee was that an Eddy reference lool
More intern appearances, please. Why? Because.
"...I will take turds as payment". Man I am still laughing and I watched this 3 months back.
Best Pitch Meeting ever!
If There is anything with success about Star Wars,  you can be sure Kathleen will be there to destroy it. Which is why Season 2 and 3 are crap.
Side quest irony ftw.  Love it
Never watched any Star Wars or run off tv shows but if those are actual scenes from them George Lucas would be shamed of Disney. Disney has destroyed Star Wars name for good.
I love the random side quest with characters we will never see again.
Perfect
Why is there a pitch meeting at the start and end of this video? I clearly clicked, "Intern makes inspiring journey to help producer guy stay awake."
Genius. And a real understanding of story structure woven in to the funnies.
3:20 Most realistic intern experience I have ever seen in my life.
So funny! Great content!
Love your content!
Cream side story, beatufull. Ty
1. Shouldn’t have destroyed the dark saber.  2. Din should have become Mand’alore
Thought for sure the coffee was gonna taste like turds
The episode with the reeducation of the ex imperials was by far the most engaging of the season. The rest was just crashy bangy nonsense with a few cool things thrown in.
Intern#2 needs his own spin off show
In fairness, if you do have a room full of genetically altered clones of yourself I think you'd probably have to have a murder button for it. Indeed probably best to have murder buttons linked to a bomb in each clone as well. Murder button for the whole room, and another for the whole base are probably a good idea as well. You can't be too careful.
Drone shots?! Marvellous!
honestly was enjoying season 3 until Moff Gideon showed up and died in basically a single episode. Finale sucked ass!
This might be my favorite pitch meeting
hhahahahaha
worst season ever
That intern side quest was great lmfao
Loved it lol!
Didn't finish Book of Boba, got maybe 2 episodes in, and didn't finish Mando 3 and stopped before the jack black and Lizzo episode I think? It was just so boring! The interactions between Mando and Grogu were always a treat but other than that nothing kept me hook. As for Boba...well Boba Fett only looked cool in the original trilogy and is actually a really bad bounty hunter and not an interesting character. Plus I feel like Anakin in saying I hate sand! I am so done with Tatooine.
The thing that I hated the most of season three was Mando being sidelined and Bo Katan being the main focus. I do care about Bo Katan right now I wanna see Mando.
❤❤❤😂😂😂❤ wow wow wow... wow! 🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂🥰🥰😍😍😍🥰😍🥰😘😘💋💋💋💜💜💜  I LOVE it!!! Xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo
Again, not disinterested in Star Wars, just what Disney has done to it.
This gag was fucking gold
RIP to intern guy 😢
pitch meeting tells me everything I need to know about a show, so that I need never watch it
Loved it! I'm glad I stopped watching after episode 1 of season 2. 😄
I loved the intern way more than anything I've ever seen on youtube before.
Cat In the Hat pitch meeting
Haha, I liked this episode of Mando ; )
Once again, Pitch Meeting is a way more entertaining that the actual show!
iI really hope that we will see more Intern guy in the next episodes 😂 His wtory was brilliant ❤
Moff Gideon obviously studied under duffenschmirtz lol
The hat name draw 😂
Mando got jealous of Boba getting to take baths.
Aha! I see what you did there! I was like, why is he wasting time with this intern’s quest for coffee with creamer? 😂😂😂 well played!
Once again, perfectly nailed it.
The pullig names outta the hat bit was freaking hilarious
Weeeeeeeeeee!!!
This has become my favorite pitch meeting yet.
Cream for the Producer Guy side quests are tight!
we need a spin off with coffee guy and other coffee guy, im just PITCHING this idea to u
Dose anyone else mouth the words when he says “super easy, barely an inconvenience”?
This is an amazing review
Oh my. The side quest was just brilliant. You, sir, are a gift to the viewing audience. Thank you. 👍
I was surprised to see the streets of Japan there hahaha
spot on.
Someone please tell me that I’m not the only one slow enough to not catch on to what he was doing with the intern at first.
The mandalorian is not a good show.
Ok hot take I really enjoyed mando S3 and usually get really mad whenever anyone talks bad about it. But for some reason I found myself laughing out loud the whole duration of this pitch meeting. Truly shows the quality of this channel.
3:56  It is stated in this part of the series that Jatpack has limited fuel, but later in the series a Mandalorian will literaly fly to space with his Jetpack.    Consistence proven here.✔
I'm quite dissapointed that the intern didn't also get incredibly fake-looking lollipop-icecream that glows in the dark.
Ryan’s genius extends into writing the “I gotta script these end things”
Fat Lizzo being fat is funny.  Why didn't they make her do any funny fat stuff?
I was waiting to finish the season to watch this and my God, is not even half way and it's already one of the best, thank you
I was wondering what was going on with this episode, until your genius dawned on me. Bravo.
I don't think anyone at Disney knows what a star wars is anymore
I do understand the issue people have with side plots having nothing to do with the show, but I personally enjoy it anyway so no complaints here.
STOOPID!!
YEAH! Space Weste.... oh... it's now Lost in Space...
Do a john wick 4 pich
You really made me laugh with this one! Thanks!
Intern Guy 2: Electric Boogloo Coming Summer 2043
But could we actually maybe see an edgy intern spinoff
Perfekt ;)
Too much.  This one sucked.
Though the senior producer guy here is asking questions, but i am sure that Kathleen Kennedy had no clue about whatever he was talking about and gave thumps up to all, cz that's all it takes to be a producer for a huge franchise in Disney 😑✌️
Intern sidequests are tight!!
My favorite ridiculous part of the Mandalorian was at the very end when Bo Katan flies into the battle between Mof and Djarin and her first comment is "I got this, go save your kid" despite the fact that she had just been in a very busy sky battle and really had absolutely no way to know what had been happening in the secret lair that somehow also had a hole in the ceiling. Come to think of it, a LOT of things had convenient holes in the ceiling this season.
Meta commentary during meta commentary
I adore this episode, I have seen several and this is one of the most funny and creative things I have seen so far! Thank you for always improving your Pitch Meetings and for being a funny person in general Ryan.
Nice sidequesting there. 👍
Very very good
That helmet in the thumbnail looks familiar.
My favorite episode by far, we need intern guy meetings
Yes sir I do!
Had the exact same thought about the ending and wanting Mando to relax and take his helmet off showing Pedro Pascal's face. Even a deep fake "Luke Skywalker" version in a wide shot in the background would've done the trick.Thank you Ryan!
Why did you stop saying Iiii doonnnt knnnoooww. After producer guy asked you why moff Gideon didn't stop Mando before he destroyed his clones would've been a great time for I don't know!😂
it took me a bit to figure out what was going on with the "quest" to get the creamer.  It's making a joke about how overly stretched each plot of the story is in Season 3.
2003's The Core.
Picking celebrity cameo names at random is tight.
GET BACK TO THE PLOT YOU SON OF A....ohhhhhhhhh I just got it.
Watching this a few months after the fact is a painful reminder of how forgettable that show is.
side quests about cream and turds are tight
Ryan! How about a pitch meeting of the most incredible piece of Pixar film ever. That will never be made into a sequel ever. Because it's so incredible. It's Wall-E.
Best car commercial ever.
The 2 random episodes ( cientist changing sides and the jack black utopy where humans dont need to work anymore) were actually cool. Doesnt really add to the show but were good enough by themselves, kind of like that one episode on the last of us
Wow this is truly one of the best pitch meeting to date😂😂😂
Please Do a pitch meeting for the movie Goncharov, it’s the greatest mobster movie of all time! Goncharov is an old classic and definitely deserves a pitch meeting video!
You did the thing!  He did the thing!
Exactly!
They all get happy endings 😂
HAHA perfect man just pefect
This is the way🤣
The bitterness in this one is delicious, like the She-Hulk one.
My closed captioning changes Grogu to Kroger, so that's pretty neat
Maybe it's just the 300 hilarious Pitch Meetings...Ryan George is the funniest guy on Earth.
I'm pretty sure The Mandalorian was a video game in the writting room of Disney. Disney not knowing how to make video games decided that it should be a -TV- Stream Show.
That intern's side quest was as necessary as all the side quests in The Rise of Skywalker put together.
I would have been 100% ok with the intern taking up like 99.9% of the video only for him to come back and the pitch meeting happened offscreen
Your side-plot encapsulates the issue perfectly.
The most important take away though, if that is the wrong kind of plunger for a toilet. You are welcome. :)
Ok ok, I’ll tell ya what……no.
Moff Gideon's clone facility was probably designed by Dr. Doofenshmirtz.
Disney are spoiling everything
One of the best Pitch Meetings. More like this please
Doesn't matter how many of these I watch they're always funny and gives details kinda on the sly
Side quests!
I saw what you did there, the side quest. I didn't like it. Don't do it again. (Ok Tiny but funny)
Ill admit, just like the waste of space episodes from Mandalorian.  I skipped the intern part :p
great video..waiting for the last of us
I freaking adore this man
I had no idea who Lizzo was until now.
I am so invested in Intern's plotline. He's literally me fr, best show on YouTube
Disney made Star Wars —Goofy
funny thing is i dont want to watch Boba Tea, so i'm not going to watch Mando s3.  s2 ends the story anyways
Is this the origins of the celebrity guest picker hat??  WOOOOOO!!
Lol. Why he would he have that button installed?
That's NOT a toilet plunger.
THATS WAYYY FUNNY
Pitching the Mandalorian show to a friend, so it’s a show where the main character goes on a bunch of side quest, and he even goes on a side quest on a different show as well.  Friend: this is why people don’t like you Star Wars nerds
Season 4 will be a plate with shit on it and a price tag sticking out of it.
"We're never going to see him again."  = "We're definitely going to see him again."
We're Disney.  Watch everything we do or else you get the Willow.
I miss the days of the old EU. I'll always take the silly bits of it because the highs were so high. What we got with Disney was saddening. It might be because I'm getting older but I hated that the studio went into the new trilogy with no planning, killing off characters to subvert expectations for subverting expectations sake, returning Palpatine "somehow" it's all been a mess. Mandalorian comes along and it seems like a breath of fresh air. It felt like Star Wars... for the first season. Then the big money decisions come in.... multiple shows to muddy the plots and maximize profits for daddy Disney's pet project Disney+.
Neve watched Mandalorian. From what I've heard from reviews this is the way........ apparently.
Best. Cut away. Ever
Off the charts genius. Would have loved riffing on Bo Katan season 1 vs mando 3 discussion
I watched the complete 3rd season, just so I could watch this pitch and understand it. The season was sooo baf in so many ways but this pitch meeting pays it off every second, its hilarious, congrats Ryan 😂😂😂❤❤
😂😂😂 This helps my Adhd
I’m STILL not done watching season 3🤣 that’s how much I lost interest
Fucking Brilliant.  The Side Quest 🤣🤣🤣🤣
damn, that sidequest had more content and plot than the entire main story, maybe you should make an intern pitch series...
This was more on point than anything I've ever watched on Disney+.
Great video Ryan. Could you do a pitch meeting for The Bourne Identity (The other Bourne films are good but I love this one), and The Mask of Zorro. These are both great films for different reasons.
Looking forward to Season 4 Pitch Meeting more than Season 4 itself!
Hilarious!!! What a perfect example of how Disney is stretching the plot of every season! 😂😂😂 I have to watch this again! 😂
As a Star Wars fan, there are no bigger babies than Star Wars fans. Mando Season 3 was great. Time to stop being mad your canon isn't the story. We know you think that your version is better.   This isn't to the Pitch Meeting dude who is comedy. Just Star Wars fans in general do everything in their power to ruin Star Wars. Everything isn't going to be an A+ for you. Sometimes experiments require a few B- seasons or movies.
I rather enjoy the mid-video Hyundai Santa Fe ad with the peaceful pan flute music... I decided...
I want to see a Pitch Meeting for John Wick 4
I'm so glad I haven't wasted my time with that season
😂😂😂
GENIUS!!!! 😊
Have the script writer guy go on strike for the next episode!
1:00  Last of Us had an episode following a random gay couple, so Mandolorian must do it too!
The soundtrack in the first two seasons was not only exellent, but also seemed at times to blend in and be part of the sounds of the show. Right from the beginning of the first episode of the third season, it`s like the music is depressed, not even trying. Or that scene where they escape the seaweed faced space pirate`s guns, which are "locked on", but are defeated by simply going fast. Then the villain shakes his fist and not-curses. My husband and I looked at each other and said the same thing - "Saturday morning cartoon!" we were digusted.
actually lost it with the drone shot by the ocean.  😆
Wow amazing. Exactly the stupid kind of fetch quests and stretching out the story which is so annoying in many new streaming series.
That was, as always, perfect. The whole sequence with the intern made the point so well.
Producing a sketch for a show that is basically a joke by itself now must be tight!
This was great. The intern and hat jokes were amazing
2:20: We interrupt your Pitch Meeting to bring you a car commercial.
Just like in the Mandalorian, the side story is much more amusing than the regular premise. 😅
haha this is spot on, I gave up on it after episode 3
Illustrating absurdity is TIGHT
You forgot the part where the whole plot point of Din getting the darksaber was completely wasted and it was just given to Bo Katan along with everything else.
Finally the normies are catching onto how shit this show is
Season 3 just undid everything that happened in season 2
I absolutely did not expect that and I respect. <3
Nailed it!!!!
La bolsa de nombres famosos es lo mas!!!
I like how you put in the meaningless side quest in this video to demonstrate the other meaningless side quest you were talking about.
2:18 Is that Japan and New Zealand? (Is that the way?)
anyone else wondering why the intern has a dodge durango and drives along the scenic seaside hwy 101 to get to the corner store? 😂
I wanted to like this program but it drags worse than one piece but i love one piece
mof gidian is the failed azymandeus from watchmen "...and thats my plan" "youre crazy, we wont let you complete your plan!" "i already did" "what?" "yea, i finished my plan twenty minutes ago, wanna watch every news station in the world talk about it right now?" "uuuuuuuum i guess"  except its "....and thats my plan" "we stopped your plan already" "i know, i watched you" "uuuuuum ok bye then" "goodbye"
imagine a character that said nothing for a total of 20 mins (probably much less screen time actually) and everyone loved him.  then you make a show about him and make him and his people the STUPIDEST civilization in a franchise about galactic wars.  its no wonder they all died in the real canon, they were dumber than animals
We are Disney and we suck thank god  One man's  trash is another's  man's  treasure  Literally dude u rock
that intern side quest was perfect 😃
Perfectly sums up how awful this show is
Watched the first episode, instantly felt bored. Watched this pitch meeting to catch me up instead. Glad I did
How far away is that store?  Love the channel. Keep up the awesome work.
Can’t wait to see producer guy’s intern’s next adventure.   Also, Ryan lives in Canada and that is actual footage of him driving to the store for cream (it’s a big country).
This is absolutely on point.
I would have been completely fine if you stretched out that coffee run for 30 mins.  Brilliant.
I don't know what Lizzo is, and I am not interested in what Lizzo is.
Big ups and downs and all side kind of way ways way to you side quest thing guy person.
One of the best episodes ever! Well done 👍
Always loved this series, love seeing it get more creative!
The intern part with the side journey was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen😂
I'd buy a "barely an inconvenience" shirt
Can i have a protein shake? Shure. This is the whey
Bravo 😂
😂 The intern part took me out. I loved the first two seasons but literally haven’t watched any of season 3. From seeing the Jack Black/Lizzo cameos and how much the show sidelines Din and focuses on Bo Katan I’m not interested.
Sorry. I love your stuff but Mandalorian is just too boring. Can’t finish this one
This was way better than anything coming out of Disney anymore!!
That hat 😂
I enjoyed the video *even though* you used "disinterested" to mean "uninterested" instead of "unbiased".
Yeah because no other tv series or film has ever left the central character to flesh out a character who will play a larger part in the future, that's not how storytelling works!
The Mandalorian was Grogu all along...
Okay well now i want to see Intern guy again
This is genius
Your creativity in using the lack of creativity in the creations of others for your own creative works is GENIUS! I never get tired of your content.❤
i choked on my own spit at the hat draw sequence.  awesome pitch meeting!
This is genius
You nailed this 1. This is 100% how I felt about this season. I mean the whole thing could have been 3 episodes or 2 if you cut out the 10 minutes of intro and outro.
I hope that like in the show the second intern that used the last of the creamer and not the one we focused on comes up again briefly.
Mando takes a bath is exactly how I described season 3 to my friends.
Important baths are tight.
Another $11 saved.
I didnt watch BoBF so i was SOOOO fucking confused when Grogu was suddenly just back. I was like wasnt he with Luke? Wtf were they thinkin with this? Why would you ASSUME everyone watched BOBF? That's a different show entirely you can't just remove plotline from a show, put it in another show and expect that people wont be confused af when the next season starts with no explanation as to what happened.
Pitch meetings on their own channel called pitch meetings is tight
I mean i get the fact that the random side characters were completely out of nowhere but i actually quite enjoyed that episode lol (unlike the jack black lizzo episode… lizzo was a very bad actor lol)
Oooh I get it!  Pointless side quest!  ...Man this show sucks.
The new intern should be fired. He took way too long to get back with the coffee for, producer guy.
Ok, producer's guys assistant's side quest was funny but it was definitely a missed oppurtunity to take a crack at Grogu's Gundam armor!
0:27 appropriate thing to hear after coming back from Gaudians of the Galaxy 3 and thinking, "wouldn't it be great to show someone this whole Trilogy.... oh wait".
Atlanta the TV show would like a word 😅
Do "ghosted" please
I'm so glad a platform that allows guys like Ryan to showcase their creativity exists
imagine stretching out plot points for a movie into 8 episodes and even that little bit of plot doesn't make any sense. remember when seasons had 13 or even 24 episodes? and what's the deal with mando being weak af and in need of rescue all the time? yayaya, Kathleen Kennedy...
Hilarious side question to prove a point is TIGHT!!!!!!!!!!! 😂❤️😝
You see i do see the point with the intern guys story maybe quite the opposite i do like seeing the mundane live of regular people in these movie universes And Assisant guys story was quite enjoyable i would watch the whole movie
Greatest Pitch Meeting. Ever.
How did I miss this release?!? Damn you youtube algorithm, damn yous all to HELLLLL!!!
👏 👏 👏
I'm so glad I did not watch S3, I liked S1 and S2 started stretching it real thin but watched it anyways but couldn't get myself into watching S3. After watching the pitch meeting I'm so glad I did not.
Nice car for an intern.  Also lizzo? Wtf why on earth would ANYONE want to see her in the show?
“If people dont watch all our shows and lose place of the story line thats there fault” um have u seen the Halo series, mofos want u to read website lore, books, another movie no one heard about really, and prob something else im missing, bc they’ve done a bar job almost as Star Wars has become
Mando has the same weakness as the unbreakable david dunn.
A show about a "bounty hunter", thats 99% filler, but zero of the filler is fucking bounty hunting. Baffling.
Starting a crowd revolt if we don't get to see more intern guy side plots in your pitch meeting videos!!!!
I'm not sure I understand. How are you this bloody good at tearing crap movies/shows a new one in only a few minutes? Most of my favourite reviewers (Disparu, Az, Mauler, Critical Drinker) do so through video essays.
This Pitch Meeting was the GOAT!!! 😂😂
Oh, please make us see the intern again 😂😂😂
Genius
Don’t you dare script for anything?
The celebrity hat killed me xD
Absolutely hysterical! Well played sir!!
This show seems insufferable
I hope to see the intern again
Wow lol
We need an intern spin off series❤ 12 Episodes at least😍
Supereasybarelyaninconvenience side quest
This was by far the best episode ever.
I really feel like this got out of hand when intern guy took over the episode that I thought was supposed to be about screenwriter and producer guy
This meeting contains Side Quests
This was one of my favorite Pitch Meeting LOL.  Although not as good as season 1 & 2, I still enjoyed season 3
Jack Black and Lizzo 😂
The side skit in this is more entertaining than most shows.
The joke about people pooping over other people shows is I think in reality, causing fundamental problems.    People complain is it even three of the Mandalorian felt like the Mandalorian became a side character. Well, he had three episodes of adventure that should’ve been part of this episode that were part of Boba Fett.    A number of people complained that Boba Fett didn’t do enough bad ass thing in his show.  Well, if you insert the episodes from season, two of the Mandalorian into their appropriate place, he kept lots of butt in those episodes.  Throwing off the pacing of season and resulting in things like the final episode of season three falling kind of flat because it’s basically the third act of a react story that most people watch on their own. It might blow better if you’re binge watching it.
this video. WAS NOT 12 DAYS AGO i sear it has been like a month
Yeah I immediately turned off season 3 when grogu came outta the ship I was just so damn confused and pissed I gotta watch a while other show to get what happens in this show
This is a contender for best Pitch Meeting ever. Epic quest by Intern #1 but I thought you shortchanged Intern #2 a bit, he showed great potential. Still, five out of four stars.
Hahaha 🤣
can't wait to see what happens to Moff Gideons followers when they find out he's dead. It should only take like 2 or 3 episodes of season 4.
This is by far the funniest pitch meeting I've ever watched. And they're all gold.
Jesus, modern Star Wars is offensively shit. Shallow, unintelligent, amateurish, and hollow.
Hahahahahahahhahahahah
can we get a few episodes about the intern
Surprised you didn’t do one of the classic “super easy, barely an inconvenience” in regards to how the darksaber was handled. Seeing as they got deal dealt with through a technicality that doesn’t quite ring.
Remember when they had to find actors who were right for the character, rather than write INSULTINGLY HORRIBLE MOVIES for people who are...yeah, sure. They're still actors.
Side quests are tight
1:17 this is spot on lol while watching reviews & breakdowns  of the show I was like, “I didn’t realize I clicked on reviews for the ‘Bo Katan and other Star Wars Side Storys’ Show.” I feel like I would have noticed a title like that. I ended up just watching reviews of the show I can’t stand what Disney is making across the board, it’s almost all like Mando season 3
The whole clone thing has become SO overused and tedious. And to think the idea of clones was introduced in Act 1 of the very 1st Star Wars movie.
The intern stretched-out plot-point is pure GENIUS!!!
The side gags are hilarious, I remember that one where producer guy got a severe case of the money eyes and got it checked in a drawn out side gag😅😅😅
The interns store scene is second in amazingly beautifully insane only to Johnny buying roses in The Room
if Im being honest I would have been fine with the whole focusing on the two random side characters if they actually paid off the investment to the audience not just killed off one and brought the second back for like 5 seconds
Anyone else feels like this show is about nothing, but is made with the sole purpose of selling merchandise of a cute puppet that makes cute sounds?
I get what you're doing, andI love it.
8 episodes,  back in the days a " season " consists of 20 or more episodes,  how things have changed
Haha, brilliant! 😅
Season 3 is among the worst things I've ever watched in any tv show. And don't forget the deleted characters because Disney is against strong women.
I like the unscripted endings
Even the "somehow Moff Gideon returned" joke was great
This is golden 😂😂😂
This instantly become my all time favorite pitch meeting. It's so on point on how we all hate how Disney ruined the only show that held the entire I P for not draining to the gutter.
I see what you did here lol 😂
Everyone knows after the third time round people lose interest. How does Disney not know this?
to be clear, Grogu is Disneys failure, the plot, writing and story are all JF and DF's fault.  I think they gave up once Disney meddled with grogu and they are going to focus on Ashoka.
Gotta make a flubber pitch meeting
still keeping it fresh :D
The side quest works as a complete metaphor for the side quest in the Mandalorian season 3. Just brilliant, you should work in Hollywood bruv, real talk.
💯😆
I thought this pitch was particularly good at the intern side quest, but then the names out of a hat bit really got me.
I couldn’t watch this season y’all sorry
Brooo don't do this shit while I'm h!gh cuh you got me effed up🤣 I thought I was watching a movie
Priceless!
Ryan, PLEASE never stop doing Pitch Meeting Videos. This is life for me now...  And thank you for the "side quest" gag. For a second there, I thought I was watching Andor and not Mandalorian!! lol
No comments about Moff Gideon's mustache?
So we will have a series about the intern? And another one about the the toilet full of turds? We Can call that...Disneyturd.
"So what's the deal with your inter? don't wory about that we are never going to see him again!". Are you sure about that?
i love the intern
Coming in Q3 2023: Store Guy, the spinoff.
Very clever.
4:05 wow... wow... wow..
Oh my good Ryan you're such a legend, I pissed myself during the side plot. Please never stop ❤
Wow, this show really sucks now. Disney sucks.
Disney is like "watch and consume everything we put put, or you're a racist and a transphobe".
"Weird place to hang out" 🤣
Love it buddy. Its just unfortunate/fortunate that I haven't seen 99% of the source material for your other videos so I can't appreciate the channel more. Keep it up.
I legitimately loved the lore based world building subplot of the intern
Omg - The Intern Guy is now “Cannon” ;)
We'll see you again, interns. I guarantee it.
Glad I'm not the only one who had a problem with the Coruscant episode. Worst one of the season by far, IMO.
I have to go against everyone else and say Intern Guy’s Quest wasn’t the funniest joke for me. My fave part was the hat with Lizzo, Jack Black and Christopher Lloyd.
The meta joke in this episode is tight
Ryan is strong in the meta...
Cannot stress enough how little Disney has made me care about Star Wars and Marvel now.
Intern Guy is the best
One of your best videos! 😂
"So anyway then he gives the Dark Saber to Bo'Katan because she is the most worthy of being the Leader of the Mandalorians." "Oh she is huh why's that?" "Well because she is a murderous pirate who literally burns down whole towns and mass murders unarmed innocent Men, Women and Children and also she doesn't care about the Mandalorian Code at all and just discarded it as soon as it became inconvenient." "Oh so she's gonna be the new badguy then?" "No she's gonna be the new Leader because she's a Woman."
Every time I think a show is good you come along and point out how ridiculous it really was
The side quest made me laugh.  Love it
Okay, this is now my favorite episode.
In a way though, if any show should be focusing on more than one character it's this one. Who ever said Jin was the main character? It's called "The Mandalorian", not "Jin Darin".  Personally, I'd like to see more of a focus on the other Mando characters than Jin. He's actually pretty bland.
Pulling the random names out of a hat 🤣 funny af and on point. Ryan at the top of his game here!!
😂😂😂 that show is such trash
This is genius
Damn, Ryan. You're killing me on this one! Gideon escaped because his Troopers knew where his transport was going (because of the Spy that yall acted like didnt matter). They attacked the transport with their sweet Beskar arms and armor.   The Mandalorians did not check if the poison had cleared off of Mandalore #1 because they are superstitious as fuck (explained through context in all three seasons), and #2 because they dont use droids which could do the necessary atmospheric tests (the droid thing is also explained through context through three seasons of this show). Not too many humanoids will walk into a situation with potentially corrosive air. There is the small chance that some tried, but got ambushed and killed (and so never reported the atmospheric stability) because they would have made a pilgrimage to the Great Forge where Gideon's Troopers were set up.
Awww cmon Ryan! They know the monster doesnt eat the kid because they know he likes to take live captives to his nest. They explained that, fam.
Honestly, taking half of an episode to show some of the Empire's machinations isnt as terrible as people pretend it is. It's almost like you get more context for future events. Like why Moff Gideon did not tell the rest of the Shadow Council that he had Beskar and could make that sweet Mandalorian armor. This also plugs and plot holes like "why didnt the First Order have this tech" or any other questions smart people would ask.
Best one yet
(All the driving shots to the store) Me: Well he did say he lives in Quebec. So that makes sense.
Chat Gpt, poop me a script my YouTube "pitch meeting" video that shall sound like it was written by a Nintendo Amibo AI.... Perfect!
2:23 drone shots Drone shots Drone shots Drone shots Drone shots Shots with a drone Drone shots  .... DRONE SHOTS..
this is peak pitch meeting
This almost makes up for the fact that every episode of season 3 made me angrier and angrier. Then made me sad Jack Black was in something. I didn't even think that could happen.
Honestly, telling the heroes all about your evil plot makes a lot more sense afterward than before or during. Good point.
This is the way.
that was AWESOME!  i Really liked having a character not played by Ryan.   Well, you DO count the car as a character, don't you?
Please do the Bible Pitch Meeting, Old and New Testament! It must be hard to find all plot holes in such a big book and squeeze them all in a clip! Unless...
5:20 evidence disposal maybe? No one knew Moff Gideon escaped his warcrime trial so it makes sense for him to have a way to quickly destroy genetic proof that he escaped custody in case the New Republic stumbled across his base.
N e w  c h a r a c t e r s  a l e r t
This weeks pitch should be a nod to the WGA strike.  If the haters can get past themselves that is.
I absolutely believe these Disney+ shows are -written by ChatGPT- made by pulling names from a hat.
I love the part where Ryan is on YouTube and is real and keeps making these and everything is goodness, I love it, I need it, and it is glorious and fantastic, and liking the video is barely an...issue.
RUCK FEY AND DUCK FISNEY
Accepting cream as payment is tight
Liking, commenting & subscribing is super easy. Barely an inconvenience!
the Intern part had me howling laughing. Thank you so much <3
Just finished watching Mandalorian season 3 & Bad Batch season 2...  So this year Star Wars movies are just scams and lame excuses to justify "Emperor Cloning" ???   Jeezzuzzzz 😡
I didn't even make it to the Jack Black episode, it was so lame
LOVE the intern side quest!  Funny!  :-D
Oh wow wow wow,,,, wow,
I was so confused when he came back with Grogu like nothing happened. Why do these people have such a hard time with consistently
Best Pitch Meeting!!
The names out of the hat joke was the best part. I feel like that’s exactly what Disney does.
I love Mando 3
This was brilliant! 😂
THIS SEASON SUCKS!! WHAT IS THIS SEASON?? I'M DELETING THIS SEASON!
3rd season was the worst.
That was a great one ❤
Thank goodness I can watch Pitch Meeting instead of the actual show. That saves a lot of time and is barely an inconvenience.
NEVER seen a single episode of this show nor many many others, but the video of the SUV driving back/forth on the dirt road seemed way more interesting/entertaining!!
I fell like I saw a season again
Binge watching an entire season just in order to watch its pitch meeting next is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Intern went all the way to Asia to get creamer. That’s dedication.
Please do season 8 of game of thrones!
Still waiting for john wick 4 goerge ryan
Next time Disney swaps out main characters, you should have the Ad-Stronaut show up and take over the pitch meeting.
.
Unclear.
Wow! Location shooting… impressive.
You guys don't get it, the rest of the pitch meeting is so much more meaningful knowing that Producer Guy is properly caffeinated, and the only way to fully appreciate the weight of that was to see Intern's entire journey to get the cream.
The side plot and music lolol
The intern side story is like in how an anime fight between the protagonist and the current villain gets interrupted by a backstory of the protagonist and a side character, then that backstory gets interrupted by a backstory of that side character for a whole episode.
The intern bit was pretty funny.
The way you’re committed to the bit🤌
You should make a spin-off about the interns. Thats what Disney would do
@ryan george that new john wick knockoff "SISU" looks like fun..it's not released here in cinemas for another month..so can't give you any pointers.
Any chance of Pitch Meeting a Bud Light advertising campaign meeting?
actually more interesting than the Mandalorian
The intern story line is KEY
When shows get worse pitch meetings get better
1:30 segment I'm wiping tears.  Touché.  🤣
are we not going to talk about how they tried to revive ig 12 just cus mando needed him for a mission when it didn't work he  shot his dead friends re-animated  corpse them later they turned it in to a mech for a 500 year old green muppet baby
The way he gulps down the coffee and continues is genius.  Inconsequential side quests are tight!
“Ok, alright, I’ll tell ya what…. No” haha!
Mandalorian Season three is dissapointing for viewers as wel, so yeah. Also... The Mandalorians had jet-packs with limited fuel supply, so they crashed one afer another when trying to save 'the kid' in episode-boring but... one other Mandalorian 9not interested enough to remember his name) could fly all the way up from Mandalore to outer space where a space ship was ... erm... hanging around AND had enough fuel left to escapre the space ship when that crashed. Nope. Not a good season.
Mad crazy😂😂😂😂
Is this preparation for the intern meeting spin of show?
Easily the best season so far👍🏻
Im glad everyone is pissed about this
perfect segment on the story side missions in mando
Idk, I thought it was nice to learn about the man who allows Producer Guy to function, and his quest for creamer. And what a scenic road to the grocery, too!
I just realised something.  Is Ryan George the adult trans version of Regina George?
did you buy a new car? are you trying to get tax credits by using it in your show? you silly goose.
At least gideon didnt "somehow" return, he was broken out of a prison  transport
Ryan Ryan Ryan, everyone knows the only acceptable plot for a big budget movie is:   1. Character show is named after is reduced to comedic relief punching bag 2. Young brown/female/gay upstart appears who is better than character show is named after in literally every way without even trying 3. Character show is named after sacrifices themselves and passes the torch off to upstart character who we never see again because no one cares about them
OMG, that was brilliant!
Since I don't have Disney+ I was a little lost on the intern side quest until I read the comments.😂😂😂
Afrer Lizzo I was done. I'll just read up on the show but im not wasting anymore time watching.
Explaining the plan after it failed is at least... original
You folks should do a pitch meeting for the 80's Dune. With the Dune part 2 coming out soon it would be the perfect time.
That intern side quest was a stroke of pure, untamed genius
This one was so good omg
Well played sir….well played.
Really funny lol 🎉
I want more intern in future episodes. Or at least surprise us with him.
At first I was like wait what? Then I was like 😄😄
How do you keep outdoing yourself? Jfc lol
The worst blockbuster shows make for the best pitch meetings!! I laughed out loud so many times. 👏
So when's the Pitch Meeting for The Last of Us?
Ryan George needs a T-shirt factory cranking out his squinty-eyed face on a tee with his catch phrases.  The guy would make a million dollars.  How much would you pay for a shirt with "Hey shut-up, so..." or "I'm gonna need you to get ALLL the way off my back" or even, "Super easy, barely and inconvenience"?  "Wow, wow, wow.... wow." There would be no end to the fun and profit.
Waited to watch this till I finished the 3rd season. Gotta say, it's perfectly timed, written, acted,  and filmed.
The writing on this pitch meeting was more well thought out than the mandalorian season. Such a disaster.  I would love to see behind the scenes documentaries just giving us a glimpse at how a studio can pour so much money into something and have it be total garbage
The side quest 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where is the Pitch Meeting of the DUNE remake?
Feels like all the writers (exception is Andor) for these shows want to make Star Wars movies and write a script that is a movie…then have to chop it up and add side adventures to create an 8 ep series. If you cut out the Corscant ep, the absolutely stupid bad video game level of “you can’t speak to those mandalorians until you complete the robot scourge quest for the queen and king,” episode, and cut a few other wasteful minutes of filler…you basically have a pretty solid 2 hour epic tale of the reclaiming of mandalore.   Buried in bad writing and filled with needles cameos that take us out of the story.
How about some of the early James Bond movies ? Too long ago  for many of your subscribers but pussy galore, octopussy ? Pitch meeting gold.
4:30 "WowWowWow ...WOW"
"star wars bad guys love somehow returning" lmao
If you script your endings, I will END YOU...by unsubscribing, of course. Glad you don't plan on scripting them because...um...they like make you more human and relatable.
I watched 1 and a half episodes a couple weeks ago, and then basically forgot about the show. Story and plot matter!
Someone in Star Wars is messing with us, when they throw in characters like Omega in the Bad Batch and Grogu in the Mandalorian. Starkiller could have replaced either.
So much truthiness in only seven minutes. I had to Force myself to watch the last episode after I fell asleep during the 7th. ::meh::
Ryan I cannot stress this enough: I LOVE PITCH MEETINGS
Yes sir I do want a Bill and Ted's excellent adventure pitch meeting
fk Ryan you're hilarious my man
The stock footage game is strong with this one!
Best pitch meeting in a long time 😂😂😂
So if Pascal only did the character's voice, all this season people were just watching different performers in a costume interacting with empty air.
Would love to see you do a pitch for either of these: Shrek series Insidious series Conjuring series
Godamn, Pitch Meeting and Ryan's channel did an epic collab. Love it !!! <3
By far yhe absolute best one you have ever done. I didn't even watch Mando past 1st season (I hear I made out like a bandit with that decision)  But Im glad ai chose to watch this. The best.
We should have more episodes with the Intern. Side character successfully stablished!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The whole plot of the lost tribes of Mandalorian could be a Battlestar Galactica rehash, but they didn't ...
Bravo on finding ways to keep these unique, after so many episodes!
Lol season 3 is hot garbage 🗑
Some of the stockiest stock driving footage I've ever seen. 👏
I don't know why I thought the characters in your universe can't drive.
Please please please make a Pitch Meeting about Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that was hilarious. watched the season with the same questions ex: "he's just going to burn to death in a ship fire? can't fly away from it? wow that's uneventful & ridiculous after what we've seen getting here. The writers can do better let them know.
Viewership is down on season 3 With such a riveting plot filled with twist and turns i dont understand how.
I'd rather watch the adventures of intern guy for 24 episodes than watch Madalorian Season 4...
Da random celeb name hat whas priceless lmaoooo
Ohhhh... stretching things out is tight!
Just finished season 3 yesterday, and this was spot on as always. Loved the intern gag
Can you do a video where you pitch The Bob’s Burgers Movie?
what the hell is this???!!?? I came here to watch producer guy and the screen writer guy. not for some interm side quest to get some coffee for the producer guy. geeeeezzzzzzzz.
I tuned out of the season the first time they went to Mandalore and they just kept going back and forth like it was a Metroid game or something. From the ship to the cave to the ship back to the cave to the mine back to the ship to Bo's place back to Mandalore back to the mine. Like your drunk friend telling you the wrong details of a story they insist is coming to a point eventually.
Damn that intern guy swinging in here with a new thread in the PitchVerse. Epic. Much more interesting than S03 of Mando lol
I have so many questions about intern guy, when is he getting his own spinoff?
Mandalorian S3 is the Godfather Part 3 of the series
😂😊
Andor really raised the bar, very very high.
Allowing us to appreciate your side quest was tight!
I really wish that you mentioned how they gave the baby a death robot that he can pilot like a Gundam.
lol
What the hell waste of time with the intern stuff
Nailed it.
That dragon episode had way too many plot holes for my 12 year old.
Side quests that do nothing to advance the plot are tight!
Side quests are tight
Do van helsing with Hugh jackman 😂😂 I already kno what you gone point out
Writer guy: "and then at the beginning of episode 7 Moff Gideon will have a meeting with all kinds of imperials like Brendol Hux and Captain Palleon where they talk extensively about Grand Admiral Thrawn's return and what the Empire should do now with that" Producer guy: "right yeah, so we can set up the Ahsoka show right?" Writer guy: "well kinda yeah, and I was thinking about an end credits scene after the last episode where we show Thrawn getting the news about Gideon" Producer guy: "yeah, I'm sorry but that's not in the budget"
*somehow moff gideon returned*
The whole part about disney refusing to show pedro's face got me 😂
Hey, are we gonna get a pitch meeting for the witcher. I feel like it has so much potential for funny jokes with the writer guy not listening to the fans
So is Disney just failing on every front suddenly?
You are brilliant.
My favorite episode was episode 3, all the others I forgot and I only remember the scientists plot
Now what happens next season of pitch meeting, do they kill off the intern?  Or does he get his own intern show?  Stay Tuned.  Also, Producer, "How do they know that the monster hasn't eaten the kid?" "Well everything is just slowed down, even the monsters eating habits."  Oh that Jack, not Jack Sparrow.  Although it may be more interesting to see Johnny's character in the Mando.
Your side quest was better
Black Mirror Pitch Meeting please!! 😂
Could you do a pitch meeting on the pitch perfect movies,  please??!!??
😊🙏💯
Dude needs to do Black Adam, but have his pitcher dressed as The Rock.
Moff gideon really taking inspiration from Doctor Doofenshmirtz with that clone self destruction button. Only the true villains take the time to install one of those
Point very verrry well made.
I legit enjoyed the side quest 🤣
I was dying of laughter during the entire car stock footage segment and I don't know why.
It really took them 3 years for 8 episodes 😅
Ryan George side quests are tight!
This was pretty great, but honestly... was I the only person that actually liked the episode on coruscant, dealing with "reformed" imperials. I thought that was a neat plot and something you rarely see in Star Wars.
Uhm.... The video doesn't play any sound for me. o.o
Ohhhh Wow wow wow wow………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..wow
It's fine if the story switches protagonist if it's well written. Episode 3 is my favorite of the season, actually.
A video idea. A pitch meeting that happens during the writers strike
We need Ocean's series Pitch Meeting. Thanks.
UNCLEAR! 😁
You should dress writer guy like Kevin Smith and pitch the aggressively stupid plot of “Dogma”
hey this one was made by Ryan George
Please add the Charlie Angels movies to the pipeline please!
Holy crap you’re a genius 😂😂😂
Looking forward to The Book of the Intern spinoff show.
That intern bit was hilarious man, great job👍
The name pulling out of a hat 😂
They should’ve waited for Pedro,
The sidequest episode was the best part of the season!
Side quest for bringing cream for producer while discussing a side quest for a show Pitch meeting is tight
The long boring shot of the car traversing emptiness is so, so Boba Fett :-)
can't wait to never see my new favorite character ever again in this series 😔
That was quite a treat!
Man i wish so much that its the Andor effect. Finally a well written show to raise the standards of the viewers. It's unlikely but a man can dream
I LOVE Ryan George… the way he portrays is THE WAY
"BARELY AN INCONVENIENCE"  😂😂😂 your signature catch phrase~~
He really went all out on that side quest.
I gave this show so many benefits of the doubt, that it was slowly but surely building up to something. A giant "meh" wasn't exactly what I had in mind though.
We need an Pitch Meeting for Twin Peaks! From the mystery detective show in season 1, to the incomprehensible acid trip of season 3!
Unsurprisingly, the Intern's sidequest had more relevance to the plot of this pitch meeting than the Coruscant detour had in the show.
I was amused.
absolutely brilliant
Disney, also breaking the canon that they paid an insane amount of money to purchase. Sending Stormtroopers against Mandalorians, unless done in an extremely large number (absurdly large) is like just dropping them in a meat grinder. The Mandalorian armor (even just the metal it's made from) was always supposed to be legendary epic in its power, which was always part of why the Fett was so hard to kill.
Glad he brought it up. That episode all about the scientist had me pissed. They could have done that in like 10min. Didnt have to take the whole episode.
"Star Wars bad guys love somehow returning!" 😂
I mean... yup. It wasn't AWFUL but this season was full of meh moments and choices. The characters CONSTANTLY taking their helmets off got super annoying. Mando being sidelined most of the season got super annoying. Random episode where they focused on the doc and imperial lady? Fucking out of place and i get what they were doing but its not really that interesting or fun so... yeah. Whole show felt pretty flat and honestly the most FUN episode was actually the jack black + lizzo one probably. Felt totally random but it was one of like 2 adventure episodes (the other had bokatan needing to save mando)
The cream sidequest was way more enjoyable than the actual episodes in the Mandalorian!
Ryan is literally supporting this whole channel on his back. I really hope he’s negotiated a fair salary.
Please more intern side stories!!!
This is just gold 😂😂😂 Interns are tight 😂😳😅
I was like, how come this one is 7 mins+ while the rest of pitch meeting vids were below 5 mins. Now I know. Good one on that 👍😁.
Yeah, who wants to watch some boring pitch meeting when there's intern-guy to watch?
its so boriing
This was great
How many pairs of glasses do you now own?
Do pitch meetings  Peter Pan and Wendy  King Arthur legend of the sword Pls
I'm really invested in intern guy's story. I hope Disney keeps producing shows so we can see more of him.
For a sec I thought you got a sponsor for grocery credits. I liked the second half better than the second half of season 3.
everything is falling apart
Excepting turds as payment is tight
I wondered why this one was longer than many of the other Pitch Meetings... Now I know #interns
Epic side quest!  Just wonder if the coffee smelled a little off.
I can officially say I’ve never hated the the word "somehow" until TroS
I expected the intern to kill the other intern and take his coffee.
There's more character development and plot relevance to this side quest then season 3 of Mandalorian.
So... is Writer Guy on strike now?
Ryan, we really want to know what happened on the pitch meeting of “Beau is afraid”. Please, show us!
Love how you didn't mention the other main character's name at all. She was my favorite part of the season!
It took me to this video of the mando pitch meetings to realize the joke behind the side-quest within pitch meetings. First side quest in the video I was so pissed now I can’t stop laughing
I need to see the intern again
Everything he does......  But he doesn't Bring Boca10 in to this conversation vid.. Is he afraid of something or someone like.....  He really didn't say anything like how She is now The 🎯 Black light owner... Btw srrrrr for some shi##* reference I didn't watch a single season just the Vids on YT
👍🏻
A way better season just happened than the actual series haha. The best pitch meeting so far!! You had me rolling!
"Taking him a while" 🤣
I'm not sure why, but I find interns venturing outside in the Ryanverse vaguely troubling.
Well... this sums up season 3 very well! 😆
This literally describes master of none S3 lol.
Idea for a pitch: the only truly horror movie Disney ever made: “Watcher in the Woods.”
"We're really filling these up! We're making it to eight!" really feels like the motivation for this season.
The coffee side story really adds subtext to the entire Pitch Meeting paradigm
Cool I love this
Disney, where male main characters are replaced by girl bosses.
Disney is in decline lately and the fact that they took the Mandalorian, one of the, if not the, most interesting show on Disney+ and made it boring for half a season says a lot about the lack of talent in the Disney writers room. Honestly if Ashoka isn't good I may just cancel my Disney+ subscription because I have little interest in seeing where Mandalorian goes from here. The show is over as far as I am concerned.
Love the side quests in these pitch meetings🤣
Can you do a Moana pitch meeting? Especially with the live-action announcement 🤦
He’s not exaggerating. The Mandalorian season three was fucking awful.
This isn't the Montreal landscape
You made mando look like antman with those eyes.
Are you going to do ANDOR??
LMAO!
Why would you put a side charter as the focus of your video it ruins the whole video no cares about the coffe boy.
Names from a hat is the perfect analogy
This episode is a masterpiece.
Ryan George is a national treasure. I hope he's living his dream.
I'm waiting for the Intern show to come out... there needs to be "Ädventures of the Intern"
This has gotta be a top 5 Pitch Meeting all time
man I love meta humor
Literally, the only enjoyable part of episode three of season three is when Bo katan and Mando are on screen seriously
Without you and your pitch meetings, life would be bleak and modern day entertainment would be meaningless
i dont get the hate for this season, to me seeing Mando or even just hearing Pedro Pascal's voice hanging out with Grogu is always entertaining somehow
I can't wait for The Book of Intern Guy to give us an inside look at his character and adventures.
Episode 3 felt so long and the intern skit replicated that amazing
Genius pitch meeting. Would have been perfect to promote some new car
I missed the middle part of the intern bit because someone was laughing really loudly. It was me.
Holy shit they totally took a Mandalorian-detour 😮
Who knew this show was even still on? 😆 🤣 😂 more hot wet Disney garbage
I think this season had some really good episodes and some really bad episodes.
Really, no one? ‘Somehow Moff Gideon returned’ was a low blow xD
we be cool if you went even harder...these shows need a reality slap
That extended shot of the SUV! A masterpiece of filmmaking
Season 1 was okay, Season 2 was cool, Season 3 was dogshit
What's the greatest Pitch Meeting ever and why is it Mandalorian S3?
Nailed it
TIPTOES!! Do TIPTOES!!
Dang, how far away was the store? had to travel down a dirt road? lol
Thank you Ryan this is indeed the way to get all the way down off of my back there
The Pitch meeting Universe is beginning with THE INTERN
I didn’t watch much of Boba Fett because it was just sooo slow, I knew Mando and Grogu appeared and was curious how they were gonna address that in season 3 of the Mandalorian and then I started watching it and nope they didn’t the characters are just back together like nothing happened so then I got mad and now I’m boycotting the show lol. Disney really needs to get a grip because they almost haven’t made anything at all that stood out to me since the pandemic started. Not that anyone else is really doing any better, but Disney feels like the biggest offender of just reusing and milking old IP’s instead of creating anything new.
Side quest are tight!@
"Weird place to hang out" got me for some reason lol
New characters, I love it! When are we going to see you in drag?
Lol these are getting better
Still hoping for a “Willy’s Wonderland” Pitch. Also wondering if you’ll do one for “Margaux”…
Why would Pedro remove his mask? Isn't that why he needed to go take that bath? lol
Lol, i never made is past the 3rd episode.
I would totally play a video game where all NPCs are just the different versions of Ryan giving quests.
I love this series but that one 3rd episode where they put that doctor story full episode i hate it
I didn’t hate this season, there was a lot of cool elements, but it was definitely the weakest of all the seasons. Hopefully the writers take the hint and smarten up for season 4
I enjoy the character of the Mandalorian. I wish the series wasn't written in the style of middle schooler fan fiction. I forgot how bad season 2 was until I was watching season 3, then i remembered it all. I'll still watch season 4. haha
The cream side plot was pretty cool !
The intern guy has a pretty nice car. Where can I apply?
INTERN THE MOVIE ONLY ON PITCH MEETING PLUS
And still no mention of Tim Meadows amid the celebrity casting. Geeze. "Get out of here, Carson Teva. You dont' want no part of this shit."
"Adventures of Producer Guys Intern(s)" Haha, the interns were a great touch! "
I see Pitch Meeting's  budget has increased.
how did the jack black and lizzo episode not get more attention, was the standout worst episode of the season
this  meeting could have been an hour long
At 1:16 I feel like that was the reasoning behind one punchman season 2  Because there were a lot of monsters that died in that season! But only one of them  ( Very literally mind you. Literally only one monster)  Was killed by the actual star of the show one punchman. The person who is referred to as 1 punchman
At this rate, Ryan will have to start making pitch meetings about his pitch meetings 🙂
When I tell you I had to RESIST skipping the intern part mannn I felt that
Perfect!!!!! Thanks 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Morgan Freeman narrates, *"And yet, as the video came to a close, we still had so many questions. How long did it take Intern 1 to unclog that toilet? How much cream did the store give him; and was the price too high? But more than that, we wonder why Producer Guy drinks his coffee so fast. That can't be healthy. For more non-answers to these questions, tune in for next season of The Ryandalorian."*
He really took us on a whole side quest just to prove a point and we all loved it 😂🎉
So is there going to be a sequel to this pitch meating so we can see what happens to random intern?
The outro🤣🤣🤣
Love your videos! Please do a pitch meeting for Southland Tales!!! It'll be super easy! Barely an inconvenience. I am going to comment this for as long as you make these until you make it. I will never give up. This is my twenty-first attempt.
This is the best one. The skit with the interns really sells it
BEAUTIFULLY done.  You’ve encapsulated “Space Errands” (aka: “The Mandalorian”) perfectly.
You forgot to mentiom how it was an important plot point that noone knew where that flying monsters nest was so bo katan had to track it. Only for them to discuss while climbing into its nest how they've been there before
I turn away for a second and thought I was getting an ad, an unskippable car ad that doesn't tell you when it will end.
Best thing to come from season three was the knowledge that Christopher loyd is in fact still alive
Loved the intern side quest. This needs a spinoff!!!
CC: Dave Balogna or whatever his stupid cowboy hat wearing name is
It's no more" Mandalorian"... it's WOMANDALORIAN now ♀️
Spot on!
😆😆😆😆😆
"we are Disney we don't care about quality or stories actually making sense"
The Armorer: ALL Mandalorians MUST wear their helmets from the moment they take the creed Mando: what about Grogu: The Armorer: no not him silly XD
Mando, at age 90: goodbye my son, I love you, keep following the way Grogu: gugu gaga
I for one has not watched the boba fett show so i didnt understand why the hell Grogu was suddenly back with Din Djarin.
me enjoying this intern episode the most
" I will retrieve the cream "
Can't wait for the intern spin off show
the cream mission cutaway was brilliant
side story is real... jaja that is the way
So funny
The Mandalorian aka. Sidequest: The Show.
I loved your side story way more then all the ones snuck into every other show these days.  I am glad for the Mandalorian tho; people were just throwing insults about complaints of the same thing in Last of Us.  I don't care if its ex-imperials or apocalypse survivors; its just annoying to get a majority of an episode which is just fluff in a short season that your really looking forward to.  Like the Lizzo and Jack Black episode is a bit cringe, but they are just there Lizzo only gets a few short moments with Grogu which end up being cute enough to be no issue.  If half the episode was Grogu and Lizzo side story it would have really sucked.
Pretty sure we got a car ad thrown in with that intern side plot. Side plots within side plots.
So glad I don't watch Star Wars stuff anymore
Laughed SO MUCH when the music starts and you forget that there was a pitch meeting back there 😂
John Wick 4 please
Love the meta commentary and having the intern stretch out the “plot” bahahahahah
Definitely one of those people who gave up on Boba Fett and never saw the episodes where they resolved that plot point. Started watching Mandalorian S3 and was WTF is happening??
Probably the best Pitch Meeting to date!   Awesome work Producer Guy!
haha the sidequest!!! 😂😂
Will there be an Intern II? You just know 10 times more people will watch this Pitch Meeting vs that horrible Mandalorian show.
"oh Star Wars bad guys love somehow returning" 😂 gold!
If Grogu is 50.. shouldn’t he be the equivalent of a 5yr old?
This is now by far the greatest online Star Wars thing to happen this year.
Soon Pitch makes more money, than the show pitched, and the shows get just produced for pitch meetings.
This is utterly brilliant. 🤣
4:39 okay but to be fair, Moff Gideon wasnt electrocuted, thrown into an endless pit, and exploded twice, so on the list of bad guys that “somehow returned” he’s probably the least problematic lmfao
this is fkn jokes ahahha, new sub right here
ehhh... pedro pascal is an ok actor at best.... but since he is just a voice actor in this show they could have done waaaay better and for less money. Also... who TF is the "stunt" guy in the mando suite who's only talent appears to be walking slowly and being generally un-ready for anything.    This show lacks everything good about a show.
That’s a beautiful road you take to the store
And this was the day the intern got added to the Ryan Cinematic Universe
Intern spinoff confirmed??
Honestly, the crap star wars fans put up with..
Mando and baby yoda sidelined in their own show. It's all Bo Katan, Bo Katan, blah blah. Poor dark saber, as well. Done with it.
Disney: People are stupid 😏  Disney when people are not that stupid: 😮📉
Not gonna lie, the fetch quests in this season are especially early 90s video game like
I was really expecting a joke that never happened.  I'm sure you can hear this in Ryan George's voice:  Writer: So the monster is going to keep the kid alive for a whole day.  Producer: Why would it do that?  Writer: So the rescue can happen.  Producer: That works.  Very considerate monster!
Oh man you missed an opportunity to add the joke ‘and they fly now’ when the mandalorians are attacked by stormtroopers on Mandalore.
Good to know that I have no problems with Disney, I don't watch any of their shows.
At last, a pitch meeting I have missed. Thank you.
Intern-guy's adventure was a hilarious new addition!
Added bonus most of the show being about Bo katan for more forced girl power hurt mando munch like its hurting most of Star wars and most of marvel. If I made a Barbie movie it was mostly about ken people would be upset and that project would lose money. Why?  Cuz the target demi isnt guys. Yes im sure a lot if guys love barbie but the audience is mostly women. Same for Star wars. Frankly put you can have our toys. You tried taking Ghostbusters... It didn't work. You tried taking star trek snd Dr who and terminator and the oceans 11 franchise and it didnt work. You're trying to take marvel and thats not working. You cant have staw wars. Much like the WNBA... We dont give a shit abd we're not gonna watch it.
This is pretty brilliant. I love the commitment to the long "side quest" gag with minor characters (I was even more bothered that we never find out what happened to the scientist, after all that fuss, OR the spy), and pointing out the absurd assumption that everyone should be watching everything at Disney+! I would have loved it if you could have also pointed out the weirdness of having Mando move backwards in his character progression (he's willing to put his love for Grogu and his friends above his oath to keep his helmet on, but then keeping his oath and becoming a Mandalorian again becomes more important than anything or anyone, and in the end, he needlessly brings Grogu down into a totally dangerous situation where he almost got killed!), and also the inconsistency in the show's effects (some really sophisticated makeup, puppetry, and CGI, but also some really silly/sloppy looking stuff like the discount Davy Jones/Cookie Monster pirate puppet). But I guess you couldn't have a 15 minute review to cover everything worth mocking. ;)
I am so glad I'm not the only one who thought this season was super weak. The episodes gave me the same feeling as the air in a bag of crisps. I paid for that air, but I'd rather it were more crisps.
I want more of your interns epic adventure. How can you tease me like that? Curse you screenwriter/producer guy, I shall forever be left wondering what other tasks intern guy may or may not complete.
Watching a whole lot of something else instead of what your clicked on is tight.
Side quest for producer with side quest is tight!
Just casually taking the piss out of one of the most meaningful ceremonies in multiple religions being represented in a show. Yeah glad I didn't waste more than 30secs on this trash
I wanna see a pitch meeting for the scrapped Colin Trevorrow version of Rise of Skywalker. Have it sound amazing in the pitch but get completely squashed down. That’d be a hilarious twist to have the first ever pitch meeting end with it being turned down, only to find out it would have been such a better version 😂
I loved season 1, season 2 was ok, and then I can't even watch pass ep 2 of season 3 it's so bland and boring.
I was giggling like an idiot during the entirety of the intern side quest 😂😂😂
Brilliant!
It was great but I think your right I hated book of boba Fett and really everything after season 2 of mandalorian not just because of bad actors or sfx. I think it was the choreography and the writing it seems like it was written by Michael and Dwight from the office. All over the place I mean the darksaber was destroyed by moff Gideon's hand? And imperial spies in the new republic just get away👍 ah I hope the intern gets his own spin off someday and maybe his boss fires him and he becomes the mailman or something. No problem at all barely a inconvenience 😂
Love the pitch meeting... bit I was not into the Bo Katan show this year... 😅
Top tier comedy and ciritique as always
I need the intern spin off😂😂😂
That intern side plot was tighter than the entire mando main plot.
I watched the first episode of this season and canceled Disney Plus. Wasn't a major plot point resurrecting IG-11? Is absolutely no one in the Star Wars universe allowed to die and not come back somehow, not even the non-living beings?
Just wish the season revealed what happened to Dr. Pershing
That intern was a more compelling character than most of the side characters in this Mando season.
oh man, sad that this happened to Mando 😢
This is my favorite pitch meeting yet!
Brilliant.
Im a biased mandoverse fanboy, and this criticism was 100% so accurate lol!
I enjoyed the third season of the Bo-Katan show which they called the Mandalorian for some weird reason. I'd love to see a spinoff in which Bo-Katan is actually supposed to be the character but which is taken over by some side character, possibly Slave Leia. Definitely Slave Leia, come to think of it.  And I also liked the Scarlet Witch movie that they called "Dr. Who"... I mean, Strange. It was tight!
I will 100% always watch The Mandalorian. It's the Star Wars content I've wanted since 1983... unlike everything else since 1983.
This video is perfection
This was golden.
"We will make it to eight."
that was SO GREAT
Masterfully done
Dude, you could make a whole "what is the intern doing behind the scenes" sketch series, of various topics.
The Last of Us is art
I would like a spinoff of The Intern Adventures please
Intern guy was perfect
Holy hell!! You have always been on point. This is legendary. Don’t ever change.
I know! How about a Pitch Meeting about the movie Pitch Perfect II?
This is the way 😂😂😂😂😂
I actually had no idea Pedro Pascal wasn't even acting this season, but that makes sense since he's busy with Last of Us. His voice played over the other guys in the suit were so in sync, I would've never have thought they were separate .
Pitch Meeting always delivers the laugh. This one was genius. Maybe the best one yet.
Season 3 in a nutshell, I'm glad I didn't finish it cause I got all I needed from this video.
Waiting andor pitch meeting
What is amazing to me, is that everyone knows what Disney is doing wrong, except for Disney.
Fun as hell!! Nice Car btw... now We know that disney accepts turd as payments to produce the same crap :P
Completely unrealistic! This pitch meeting should have dragged on for 45 minutes+ with a maximum of 2-3 funny moments.
Cameos inside crossovers inside side quests inside bottle episodes are tight.
Still better than Nostalgia Critic cutaway skits.
well done. just well done, everyone gets the bit here. props to you man 😆
This, was, awesome! 😂
Thats it ? There will be allways bunch of haters. S3 was excelent. Grow up. Find some girlfriend kiddo. Start live, be positive. GL man :D
Soooo good😂😂
I want to peek into the parallel universe where Pitch Meetings ends up with huge funding and develops into its own full Sketch-ematic Universe
More intern!
Love you,  but Paz Vizsla didn't deserve not being mentioned
Ironically the intern bit was the best part of the entire thing
You know you Canadian when a trip to the store involves traversing a vast wilderness
Yeah, I only watched season one, but this all tracks.
He’s really taking things up severally notches with these things
this was hilarious
This was fantastic!
Can you just do a little mermaid pitch meeting ahead of time
The intern scene would have been more accurate if he had walked to the store instead of driving. Walking is Disney's favorite way to fill the time. They used it A LOT in Andor and Obi Wan. Watching Disney plus shows with my son, I say frequently, "Oh look, they're  walking, again!"
Yeah, I watched up until the second to last episode, didn't even bother to watch the finale. I'm done with star wars, as long as disney has it it's going to turn into crap. Why do I even bother? Clearly it wasn't made for me, I'm not the demographic. Meh, game of thrones all over again.
Mando, Dr. Strange. Dr. Strange, Mando.......
It is pretty sad when the only thing keeping Star Wars alive is EA!
And who clogged the toilet?        Lizzo.
And now that YouTube is more entertaining than Disney...😊
Where did this intern come from? Is he explained in another Pitch Meeting?
I didn't even finish Boba Fett.  Just lost interest.
I didn’t understand the intern part until the “dw we’re never gonna see him again”😂😂😂
Accurate and more entertaining than the season itself!
I don't know why but my mind thinks these are 2 different people now
No showering while wearing a helmet that covers your whole head I’d be freaking out every time my head itches and someone is around so I can’t take off my helmet
oooooh Savage! I did not watch Mando 3... and now I know why.
One day Disney will calculate that it is cheaper to buy Pitch Meeting instead of improving their show quality, so they will be made offer they cannot refuse. After that there will be only positive reviews of Disney products.
Meanwhile ppl at Disney are whatching this and taking notes
I haven’t seen Season 3 yet, but when I heard that Jack Black, Lizzo, and Christopher Lloyd were in one episode I thought to myself, “Isn’t this totally random mashup what the Holiday Special did by bringing in all those random musicians and comedians?” The only one who seems like he’d fit is Christopher Lloyd.
"IF YOU DON'T WATCH ALL OF OUR SHOWS THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. " Said Disney Calmly.
This has to be the best satire of a Show since the Rings of Power video
That was excellent replica/mockery of the Mando show. And indeed the whole Disney Franchise.
Every one of those side characters is a Disney pitch meeting.  Never know when you're going to hit another Captain Jack Sparrow or Herbie the Love Bug.
demonstrating absurdity by being absurd. cheers
X love somehow Y looks like a promising new catchphrase...
Slow clap.
Slow clap.
How have you not done Fight Club yet?
You really Seth McFarlaned that coffee quest there didn't you bud? 😅
Ok confirmed he got stoned when he came up with this ❤😂😂😂
Watching that weird side quest story was super easy barely a inconvenience
This show was my final hope for Star Wars and they fucking butchered it.
Can someone show this to Disney so they can realize how stupid these side shows are with pointless characters!
yes RIP INTO THIS SEASON
"Don't worry about that we'll never see him again" that was the whole season. That boy being in the birds ummm where ever to be spit up a day or more later alive was tight!
I actually like the show this season for a lot of the reasons that are the jokes in this video 😅 lol still hilarious and accurate
You Are Genius!!!
These are amazing. Can you do Shrek next
I want to know Intern Guy's story now 😳😄😄
Genius
Honestly I'm not even checking for Honest Trailers anymore. I check for HISHE because I like the guy. But after a release what I'm waiting for is the Pitch Meeting.
A huge Star Wars fan, watch everything Star Wars.  Loved Mandalorian season 3, but this was great.  However, i think he does oversimplify some key points.  One reason I loved season 3 is it gave me more of an immersion into the SW universe
Im a big fan of everyone being sick of The Mandalorian. Its just a shame that season three has to personify the issues prevalent throughout the entire show so greatly for it to be noticed. First two seasons have all these issues and are pretty awful, guys
Intern side quest 😂😂
Can you please do The Original 1990 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 🐢🐢🥷🏽🐢🐢
Ok hey I’ll tell you what…. No
Never mind the side plots cos they can be fun to watch, but it's annoying immediately going from season 2 to 3 only to realize Grogu magically appeared again cos you're forced to watch another show to find out what happened. And it's a HUGE part of the show
When Lizzo is the least bloated part about your show.
Colony season 2
Wow wow wow wow.... Wow! Ahhmazing pitch meeting as always. Please do Ghosted! It's perfect for you, plot holes and questionable physics abound! Lol 😂
The side quest to unclog a toilet was tight!
As usual, a pitch perfect Pitch Meeting.
Lmao best pitch meeting
I love all your series. Makes my day. You should do ALL THE JAMES BOND. 😂
Season 3 was somehow even worse than this parody makes it out to be. You left out how Mandalore was supposedly uninhabited, yet there is a whole group of mandalorians living there, who somehow never noticed a giant Empire mining operation. You left out Grogu’s ridiculous robot ride too
Best Pitch Meeting so far!
Man that intern gag was brutal. I couldn't have found a better way to criticize the show myself. He even mimicked the voice style of the show. Hilarious.
Disney Star Wars is such a cringe laden, catastrophe of a failure it’s spawning an entire side-economy of mockutainment & parody
As much as i loved Bo Katan and Din, this show was so boring, the only scenes that caught my attention were the action scenes witht the jetpacks and Bo Katan beating everyone's ass in a few episodes ;) the rest was dull and boring and i was not interested in any of it.
Great video! You never seem to disappoint! ❤
Love the spiritual travel music😅
Best one ever 😂
Not your best work, but the side quest was tight! 😁
What's like to be in this guy head ?
Mate, you're such a good writer, that I dont watch Disney+ but I still enjoy every vid you put out. Keep up the good work (and the whoops whoopsies!)
The Mandalorian 1st & 2nd seasons = Original Trilogy (satisfying story arc that ENDS) The 3rd season = Postqual trilogy ('cos we're Disney and we're gonna make it the way WE want! Oh, also MONEY!!!)
Im dieing, this may be the best one yet
Sadly Accurate eye opening details I ignored because I wanted to enjoy the journey.  Ouch Disney!
The "cream" may not have been what intern thought it was.
we need a pitch meeting about death note (Netflix adaptation)!!!
Season 3 was shit!
The length of time he hung on that final drone shot of the SUV driving on the dirt road.... was.... genius?
To be fair everyone’s favorite episode of The Last of Us was the one that wasn’t about the main characters. 😜
I demand an intern spinoff!
Intern toilet unclogging side quests are tight
The Ryanverse expends - now I am invested in the Intern-Story.
this was great
Nailed is as always. I don’t understand how this show is run by the same people as Season 1 and Season 2 was. Completely different feel. Why can’t Disney afford professional script writers?
Hap tip to you, sir. Well done!
bravo my friend @Pitch Meeting
Bloody producer was cheating during that celeb lottery. He didn't close his eyes. he wanted Jack Black and Lizzo.
This is the way...
Did he say super easy barely an inconvenience
The side quest is the most amazing thing ever 😂
i'm really hoping grogu isn't yoda's clone in season 4...
Man this was gold so many points covered hilariously too.  Another thing that gets me is. How did all the other mando's even get to the nu secret planet? Where did they all come from and what were they doing b4? None of the seem to have ships until the fleet shows up later. And it wouldn't be like they got there on a commercial space ship either. Because its a secret planet. How did the armourer even get thea? And to the space station coven too b4 that? Off-screen is how of course, it is the way. Speaking of the space station Din never asks how they actually got thea? He just thanks Paz instead. Meanwhile, they all;  How'd u get hurt? How did u get this? What happened to this? What happened to that? A flash back prologue cliff hanger between 2 episodes with 2 separate stories cut in half between both episodes showing how would have been better. They really could have, should have expanded on stuff like this instead of what we got.
3:35 don't do that man we really need more side quests with your intern.
At first i thought the intern was gonna be a new character but then when he was "sent to get cream" i got the Mando reference! So clever!
To be fair I loved Episode 3. That was my favorite episode of the season
Intern side quests are tight!
The main reason the Mandalorian was pushed to the side is to introduce a bossy, strong female character
Stopped watching The Mandalorian after season 1. Obviously that was the right decision.
You should do a pitch meeting on sisu
This is art!
I felt sad for that really bright intern (at least brighter than Rian your-theories-suck Johnson or Tiker Watiki).... Is he one of rhe 7k Disney are letting go?
I am totally okay with both yours and Mandalorian’s sidestories. ❤
The intern gag and the celebrity hat are next level humor. Definitely my favorite Pitch Meeting episode!
why would moth gideon have that? He learned from Doofenshmirtz
I truly believe there is a room of writers and execs in an office just dumbfounded and literally confused as to why their shows are fucking failing. 🤣
Intern should've been debating whether to buy the creamer that comes in the white box or the red one like the Imperial biscuits.
Are we going to get D&D movie pitch meeting?
We've never seen a pitch meeting side quest.
Canada 🇨🇦 is so dusty
Season 3 was absolute shit.
This is, I believe: * The first Pitch Meeting to ever feature an overhead shot -- of anything * The first Pitch Meeting to have a shot of a moving car * (I THINK) The first Pitch Meeting to have a store and storekeeper * Much like the movie PSYCHO was the first movie to show a flushing toilet, this is the first Pitch Meeting to show a flushing toilet.  Gettin' fancy, Ryan!
Yeah the only thing keeping the Mandalorian alive is the cute puppet.
Why no GOT reference for Mando bending the knee?  Season 3 was complete crap.
Brilliant work
Season 3 was dragged out and kinda boring.
6:10
Your beard looks disgusting like a neck bearded weeaboo smelly poopoo loser.
wait wasn't Luke sky walker train by yoda?
Nooo i loved the intern, its my favorite character! He needs a Spinoff Channel.
Do star gate. I never u dets rood how they didn’t randomly just open the portal if they had the first 6 points and never randomly just went through the wheel to eventually stumble upon it. I don’t know how the hate works.
brilliant
OMG, OMG!  Ryan buddy, you out did yourself this time with the intern side story.  That killed me.  I mean I'm not dead or anything, it just it was really funny.  It's an expression.  I hope you didn't think I actually died.  I mean how could I write this if I was dead?   Any way great one.
It’s like this show was written by George and Jerry Seinfeld. “A show about nothing”. Half the episodes are side quests that have literally no purpose plot wise and the other half are just “The strong independent woman who don’t need no man saves the day yet again”.  Throw in a black whale, a washed up comedian, and an old guy that no one’s cared about in 20 years…and you get a pile of trash that makes the last trilogy look smart and sophisticated 😂  What an absolute joke.
Ah god dammit Ryan - you outdid yourself here.   Amazing
Writer guy needs a cowboy hat for the Ahsoka Pitch Meeting. I Have Spoken
This show felt like I was watching The Falcon And The Winter Soldier. They just kept talking and talking, with small lackluster action scenes sprinkled in between.
That pastral dude isn't that great of an actor
Are turds at the equivalent of bitcoin at this point? Cuz if not i want nothin to do with em. I need gold........
When does Luke Skywalker show up on screen? I saw Zach and miri and the porno they made and he was by far the most pimp luke EVER!
I'm really hoping for a Jack Black cameo
Just listening to the Screen Rant of this made feel My Brain was melting like the Faces of the Soldiers on the "Riders of the lost Ark!!"
This was amazing. The intern side quest was the best
this may be the best one yet
👏👏👏🤣
I accept turds as payment...my life sucks ...
I wish I could like this more.
I suspended disbelief for that episode where the doctor and woman went on a date and ate space popsicles and she betrayed him because I assumed it would eventually pay off but it really didn’t.
This is easily the most inspired Pitch Meeting ever created. It channeled the season so hard 😅
Perfectly summarizes Mandalorian :D
I was an intern and I can verify that’s how you get cream.
Yep. Pretty much how I feel about ALL shows.  Although, back when I watched TV (over 20 years ago), drama series inevitably, 100% of the time, turned into soap operas.  Kind of like James Bond or even the Matrix did... I guess now, they just throw s*** at the wall and publish whatever Doesn't stick...
Is the person getting the coffee supposed to be Kathleen Kennedy?
"Is there anything we can do? 😦" "Oh... I tell you what 😄... No 😐"
Season 3 was trash. Star Wars is dead (and has been dead since Disney purchased them.)
Could've done with longer aerial travelling shots...🚗
"Star Wars bad guys LOVE somehow returning" 4:39
My God, that intern bit was better than the whole season 3 of the Mandalorin.  You're a better writer than disney star wars writers.
😂😂😂😂 the commitment to the bit!!!!!
I wonder how they masked the smell of Lizzo on set when filming?
Gotta say Ryan, youre pretty good at this lol
Do a pitch meeting for Sisu. It has literally the worse writting I have ever seen.
WTF is a Moth Gideon … He is and always will be Gus Fring!! And those are Fring clones!!! 😅
How many twin brothers does Ryan have? 🤔
Could you do a pitch meeting on the 2003 cat in the hat movie with Mike myers?
When you force yourself to finish the season just so that you can watch the pitch meeting
I can't believe Ryan purchased a drone, looped in a friend to control the drone, and drove himself down a beautiful seaside cliff for that drone shot that's totally not stock footage. 10/10 dedication.
I’ve waited so long for this season and it was absolutely terrible Imo. It was slower than anything before it AND a lot of it felt like it was mostly filler and bored me. And weirdly it’s called The Mandalorian and yet I feel like Mando and Grogu were barley even in it.   This 100% could have been ANOTHER Mando spin off like BoB and could have just focused on Bo with Mando doing Cameos cus this? This was NOT worth the wait.  The video however was Beautiful you are a beautiful beautiful man RG!
I loved the first two series of Mando, but after how dull Boba Fett was and then the fact they backtracked on the greatest series finale of all time, I gave up. Thanks for saving me 8 hours of my life whilst simultaneously being far more entertaining in the process.
The casting budget is getting insane ! Did you take raid shadow legends money
Great episode man thank you
Nice video but didn’t even mention the dark saber. That was integral to the plot.
You should do a Galaxy Quest pitch meeting! 😂
Intern Ryan going on an epic side quest to prove a point 😆
No mention of Zeb's cameo in The Pirate episode?
When you complete side quest during the story mode
Pls do andor
It's pretty obvious that the stretching out and insertion of irrelevant plotlines is because Favreau stole the first two episodes of Season 3 and inserted them in Book of Boba Fett.   They wanted a full 8-episode season, but the overall plot was already set, with pre-production done and episodes being filmed, so the filler material couldn't tie-in with the existing plotlines -- hence the clone doctor story that went-nowhere-did-nothing and the absurdly stupid malfunctioning droid story.   But since those two episodes also needed to steal some scenes from existing episodes to blend in, that meant they had to shoot additional filler scenes to take their place in the other episodes, so you got scenes with pointless time-wasting conversations inserted.   In short: blame Kathleen Kennedy for screwing up Book of Boba Fett for how Mando season 3 turned out.
nice side quest that was longer than the main one
Severe Laugh-Out-Loud during the intern side quest!
Can you pitch the D&D movie? It was surprisingly good.
20 unborn clones are murdered and nobody bats an eye
It took me a good 20 seconds to understand the meta. Great job
You are genius man! Cheeeers :)
Prey (2022) could be interesting material for Pitch Meeting.
Yeah, I wanna see a Pitch Meeting about Pedro Pascal playing a loner taking care of a kid all of a sudden.
"...I dream of becoming a tight producer guy myself," snuck up on me.  🤣
You don't respect the show at all in the least bit, do you!?????😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ah, there were so many jokes that could have been made about this season. Would have been better than a big portion spent on intern guy, but I guess that's the point. Haha
One of your best pitch meetings in a while
This is the tight way!
so how long before Disney buys Pitch Meeting too??
Takes a while to play out the Jewish history theme in the background
S3's numbers disappointing to Dickney, huh? How do they think the *fans* feel?
Great Pitch Meeting! I loved the third season despite all the egregious plot-holes and absurd inconsistencies  Ryan exposed! Makes me wonder what the writers mand producers are thinklng...
I cant velieve he forgot about the big mandalorian who stayed behind to fight off the guards because there were too many of them, only to theb effortlessly fight off all of them
I stopped watching the Mandalorian a season ago, thank you for your interpretation it was spot on
That “watch everything we put out or else.” Was a nice touch
After the nailing the disappointment of Mando season 3, now do the disappointment of Picard season 3 !
@03:36 broke my heart! I had got so attached to the Intern!
don't you love how mando was being escorted by two guards and they never thought to take off the invincibilty beskar helmet in case of escape?
I will never rest until it is explained to me via dozens of YouTube videos exactly how what is essentially "The First Guy Ever To Barter For Services" fits into The "First Guy" chronology.
This was a perfect side quest story! Tight!
This is top five of all the pitch videos you’ve done. Hilarious.
I will continue to never subscribe to Disney+-*/#@&%^.
Inaccurate! I was watching this side-plot with bated breath, I was glued to the screen! Unlike with Mandalorian. I now demand full spin-off about the intern (you know Disney would be thrilled with this level of feedback and greenlit three spin-offs about interns).
"The cream of pitch meetings set"
obviously the machine with all the clones was constructed by Dr Doofenshmirtz who's technology, as we all know, requires a self-destruction button to function properly.
First time we see footage of the Ryanverse environment, huge moment there
I stopped watching after episode 3, clearly it was the right decision.
The pitchmeetingverse is expanding.
I want to see the Intern Guy show now.
That ad was just Intern Guy driving to the store.
I gave up on Boba 3 episodes in, and was extremely confused as to how Mando and Baby Yoda ended up back together.
Thank you Ryan for conforming that Mando Season 3 is a pile of not very warm sick! 😄
I just found this channel. Surprised he hasn’t poked fun at Titanic yet lol.
genuine gold
Not a correction exactly, I thought you'd want to know. "Disinterested" is not a synonym for "uninterested". It means "impartial". Judges are supposed to be disinterested in their cases. The last line should probably have been "lose interest" instead of "become disinterested".
Main characters being the main characters in their own show is super difficult, a total inconvenience!
Moff Gideon: "I was isolating the potential to wield the Force, and incorporating it into an unstoppable army. And you smothered them before they could draw their first breath."  Din: "Hey man, they could've been breathing this whole time. You're the one who kept them in water."
And this pitch meeting is one of the reasons why I'll never have to actually watch the show!    Many thanks  😁
And you see, watching this pitch meeting to 5:14 is how I learned that season 3 didn't end at episode 7, so now I'm off to watch episode 8. *brb*
I wanna know more about the intern unclogging the toilet!!!😂
I've said it before and I'll say it again. Ryan should be cast as Kang in the MCU.
I love you… I mean you are a genius. The Intern mission is so funny 😅
This was a better episide of Mando than the actual episodes of Mando.
Youghtta shouldn't do so don't eh.
My only wish is you picked up on the fact that the Mando's couldn't chase after the dragon because their jetpacks couldn't make it that far but then in episode 7 a Mando uses his jetpack to fly from the surface all the way into space. Would have been a perfect "imma need you to get all the way off my back"
That the whole bit in series 3 with the scientist chap and the other one who betrayed him and fried his brain was so laboriously crafted but the outcome was just vacant. They just dropped that whole storyline to the point that I was thinking "did I actually see that in Andor?"
Skill set?! He uses a sink plunger in the toilet instead of a toilet plunger. 😂
But...but if he took his helmet off around Grogu, wouldn't he have to spend three episodes taking a bath again?
The Book of Boba Fett was pretty Miserable in the first few ep, I dipped... then they make it 'required viewing' for S3 of Mandalorian...  After the Miserable Obiwan show (I finished it with friends, but only because of them), I didn't even have the desire to try Andor...  S3 Mandalorian is... I mean if someone really wants me to watch it with them maybe, I've rather dipped-out on Disney Star-Wars, not... as many like to say 'Oh, Star Wars Fatigue', no... it is Bad-Storytelling Fatigue.
I LOVED the intern side quest, we need a lot more of him in this show for sure
These are just getting better and better. Ryan really found his muse and captured the art of comedy. Keep delivering, good sir!
Im gonna say something SUPER nerddy but the edit on the mandalorian's helmet makes him look like a kamen rider 😂🧡
Little dissapointed you didn't mention Paz Visla's completely meaningless and poorly justified "last stand" and death. Only other character from their group that wasn't a complete NPC and lore wise he would be the dark saber is most important to
I hope we get a Pitch Meeting spin-off staring Producer Guy's Intern Guy...
Thought we have already hit rock bottom with Star Wars, boy was I wrong.
*I would love a **#WrongAnswersOnly** list* of _what other_ *celebrities* _were written on the papers❓_ Ready… *GO❗️*
Nailed it. Season 3 was a huge let down
Explaining what you blew up, actually makes more sense, and explaining before they blew it up !! Best pitch meeting ever😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I fear for that day when disney decides to sue him because viewers are not watching the show once he uploads a pitch meeting
https://youtu.be/aq2HUf4MT_Y
So wait Pedro pascal was never on set for this season? Did they just have him record some lines and okay it over the footage?
Should do shadow and bone next
That's the most accurate description of extending side stories for money in Disney shows ever 😂
Honestly the Intern story was very compelling. I would also like to watch Second Intern's slow progress to becoming a Big Producer Guy
Ryan!!!!! You're crazy. Had to do your own side quest
But wait what about the interns I WAS WATCHING THAT
Honestly this is better than the majority of the latest season
The cream 😂😂
This was the best one in a while! Nailed it!
This is great!
What in the hell was this episode 😆😆😆😅😅
The intern side quest was hilarious, but I really thought that Ryan would have addressed the bizarre decision to "resurrect" IG-11 (but not really IG-11 at all).
Okay, so listen up, fellow memers and Star Wars fans, I'm here to give you the lowdown on The Mandalorian, or as I like to call it, "Baby Yoda Adventures". This show is about a super cool bounty hunter, who wears shiny armor like a boss, and goes on all sorts of crazy missions across the galaxy.  But the real star of the show is the cutest little green alien you've ever seen, Baby Yoda! He's so adorable, with those big eyes and pointy ears, and he's always getting into trouble. I mean, who wouldn't want to protect this little guy with their life?  And let's not forget about all the epic action scenes, like when the Mandalorian fights those giant monsters, or when he takes on a whole gang of bad guys single-handedly. It's like watching a video game come to life!  So, if you're a true Star Wars fan, you need to watch The Mandalorian ASAP. And if you're not already a fan, well, you will be after watching this show. Trust me, it's the best thing to happen to the Star Wars universe since the original trilogy. May the force be with you, my fellow redditors!
TV shows are dead. They were killed by YouTube app.
RYAN PLZ DO SHARK TALE ITS SO BAD ITS AWESOME.... Also your TIGHT 😉 I watch your stuff before most movies, your evolution in video production is immensely satisfying. Love the travel bit🤣
no mention of him not using all the gadgets he spent the previous seasons getting when they would come in handy, or other people using the gadgets/tools we know they have at times when it would have really helped them out. of course if the video went into all the issues it would be overbloated, and the intern gag was definitely worth it. i was actually a little disappointed it didn't go a little further, but that just made it keep with the side story in the show since that ended just shy of where i wanted it to end. Disney should probably have hired Ryan George to write the season.
Watching this was so cathartic. Thank you Ryan!
Cycles of watching pitch meeting. Laughing (it’s funny) realization (it’s funny because it’s true isn’t it) sadness (cause the franchise is being killed)
Can you do a Chuck Norris pitch meeting
YES SIR I DO.
Little mini green marketing ploy GroguTurd
Oh, the viewership is disappointing to Disney? Well i guess that's fair, since Disney is disappointing to the viewership.
Love how in this, it's apparently the executive who asks good questions about the screenwriting, while the guy with the script is the one coming up with garbage.
What is happeni.. oh yeah!! The womandalorian!!! 🤦🏿‍♂️
Amazing how you have done hundreds of these pitch meetings, and this still tops them. The side plots were just genius.
This intern may never become relevant again but he surely will fuel countless fan theories in the future☕
comedy gold!
Great work
This was genius.
Whatever this is.. more of it
This is the single greatest pitch meeting ever!
Ryan, you're goddamn brilliant.
You forgot the part where on the way back from the store, Intern 1 is captured and Intern 2 has to go save him.
Do side quest. Get XP. Upgrade armour. Do side quest. Get XP. Upgrade ship. Do side quest. Get XP. Upgrade sword. RPG TV.
nice bath tile
Between Kennedy continually interfering like when she fired Gina and executive meddling ruining his plans again and again Favreau gave up this season and he will likely be leaving Lucasfilm.
This was amazing and completely encapsulated the stupidity of Season 3.
Every time I finish watching something, I feel the need to hop over here and see if there's a Pitch Meeting. Never disappointed. 😂
Subscribing to things is tight.
Disney i an example of CLOWN WORLD!
Why can't people just enjoy shit? If you don't like it don't watch, instead of watching the whole thing then making a 10 min vid complaining about it. Everyone's a fucking critic now.
The driving part killed me
I followed the Mandalorian closely for S01, S02, and Bobba. But when I heard how crap S03 was, I found no point in wasting my time. That's where Pitch Meeting comes in.
Wow, and I thought MY local grocery store was unreasonably far away.
I would really love to get an andor pitch meeting
That was perfect and hilarious!
Brilliant.
Is intern guy getting a spinoff now?
It’s too damn funny because it’s true. Also Pumpkinhead please
You monster!  You have two first names and one of them is your last!
0:20 Answer: Or else I'll simply watch none of them, lol. I'll just watch Pitch Meetings instead!
Easily the best pitch meeting of all time
Best one yet! 😆
Amazing!  You just turned routine errands into epic quests!!
OK, that was genius.
Nailed it so hard.
We get more information about the firm and other people who work there  So cool hahah
Was it hard to get creamer for your coffee? Super easy, barely an inconvenience.
I’m really happy for Pedro pascal, that he is in the last of us series because Mando is done, the show is just meh now. Very happy that he was able to take the hype of the first two seasons to get a role in a good show and not just be “the Mandalorian” and nothing more.
Mandalorian in a nutshell
This is my favourite pitch meeting yet. Everything I felt about Season 3 Mando wrapped up into one neat package.
haha.... yesss the trip to get cream for coffee was awesome.... well played, for sure :)
The show really did feel like it started halfway through episode 7. Honestly the first episode of the season should have been Mando flying into the atmosphere of Mandalore, wondering why he was getting strange tracking signals and revealing that the entire surface was a super giant mega imperial hold out and they used the legend of the planet to keep people away. Then 8 episodes of winning the planet back with a huge all out battle not just 20 people in a cave for an entire PLANET.  Everything in this season could have been cut aside from like 20 minutes and I’m not joking
"Maybe we should let the main characters be the main characters of their own shows?" "Look, sir, clones were all secondary characters in Clone Wars and people loved that show, so I need you to get AAAAAAAAAALL the way off my back here."
where was the random creature that stretches out the plot in almost every episode?!
Very creative 😂😂😂
Kathleen Kennedy needs to stop ruining Star Wars
the power of grogu still compells me :D
Every episode is somehow getting better!
Best yet. More intern.
Me: aw sweet, new Pitch Meeting! I was just gonna jump in the shower, this is perfect to listen to since I already know what Writer Guy and Producer Guy look like so well and most of the gags are language-based anyway.  Ryan: [proceeds to release the most visual-gag-driven Pitch Meeting of all time]
Epically funny and on point as usual.
All you've done is prove side quests ARE tight.
What a perfect summary of season 3
We're at a point where my dog could eat a can of Alphabet Soup and crap out better writing than what Disney is producing these days.
BRILLIANT
Lol
Ok the intern thing was genius ahahhha
Oh Great  now the intern is going want their own show.
Imagine if all disney were cross-linked. Maybe a scene in Cinderella where Scar killed tinkerbell. That could really mess things up and be super confusing  🤣
Considering Disney's mentality with social media, I am suprised that George did not have Backslash or even put to trial for these videos.
They could've just, y'know, made a Bo-Katan TV show. Or, have her and Mando both be main characters instead of pushing Mando to the side
Excellent content as always. I hope we see intern again 😂
I would watch the adventures of coffee intern all day in the hopes that multiple episodes would revolve around the store clerk with coffee intern not being part of the plot at all.
Maybe one of your best pitch meetings so far lmao
There’s Mandalorian kid with helmet on!? Talk about the lore! Man I have to start watching the show. Then again there’s already Pitch Meeting.
Generic adventure music is tight
If Kathleen Kennedy got down on her knees and apologized to Gina Carano for what she did to her, and begged her to return with a hefty pay raise, and Gina agreed, I might consider watching another episode of The Mandalorian.
Disney Star Wars sucks so much ass
This IS the way!!
Why would i watch the shows when Ryan does an amazing job of condensing them into a tictac sized novelty.
Ded.
wow - so on point! the only people who have run out of sw idea's seem to be disney - how bereft of talent they must be when every youtuber can pitch much better idea's ...
I see Ryan has a tat on his right forearm.
Stretching things way out is TIGHT
We're Disney. Watch everything we make or else :D :D :D
U do not know de way
Henceforth we shall call it 'the intern digression'.
Noooo I'm being tricked into a side questtttt 😂
The sand speeder SUV is everything
His journey has just begun, and won’t end until every creamer has been found, even if those who try to stop him are of his own tribe.   “Intern” coming this fall, only on Ryan+.
Philip Bloom sent me here
3:35 I really kinda hope Ryan was joking when he said we'd never see that Intern Guy again... 👉👈🥺
Hopefully Ryan makes a new channel called “Intern Guy” so that we can learn more about his backstory and the overall contribution to the plot of the Ryan George saga.
Do I detect a spinoff series for the intern??
I didnt think these got any better. I was wrong.
Ok, I’m not gonna say this is your best episode …………..but it is.  Outstanding video. Truly hilarious!!!
I hope you hired yourself to drive that SUV in the middle of some coastline while recorded by a copter crew of your self and your self you hired to get the footage, and edited by three more versions of yourself handling vfx and sfx in the editing.
Ryan George never tells me to watch everything he makes, or else. And yet I pretty much do. Maybe Disney should look into some some of this reverse-psychology thing. Or perhaps get better writers.
To be fair, that coffee bit was entertaining as well as it added something new... But we all knew where that side story was going... deception, betrayal, spy work.
Where's THE START CHIME!? That was a signature sound like Windows booting up!
The intern bit was honestly better than Chapter 22.
Thanks
This season of The Mandalorian is one of the cases where the roles and dialogue of the The Writer and Producer Guy should be switched.
My wife and I laughed so hard at this episode we woke the baby twice, and I had to watch the rest laughing into a pillow.
Yup, that's why I got about 20 mins into the first ep and had to switch it off. They ruined it.
6:24 that really got me for some reason XD
checks out
🤣 ! I love to see the Ryanverse expanding
Brilliant...just brilliant
idk i liked both side quests
Am I the only on mildly disappointed the intern didn't get more screen time?
That was the best pitch meeting yet! I had to hold my mouth shut to not wake my wife with laughter.
Disney can eat me.
I never seen  Bobafett Disney! I'm lucky i have Ryan explaining me Hollywood.
I will accept turds as payment.  Omg I’m dead.
"Don't worry about that, we're never going to see him again."  😂 omg SO ON POINT with the absurdity of that episode!! 😂😂😂
The digs on the celebrity names drawn from a hat and the side quests no one cares about were so funny.    Ryan has outdone himself.
Shoulda put something in there about how the Mandalorians immediately fall into an obvious trap on Mandalore.
"Is is hard to get to the store?"-"Actually yeah super hard, very much an inconvinience"
I guess in the Ahsoka show, 30% will have Ahsoka, while the rest is Rebels and maybe some Mando.
XD a lot of people were unhappy with s3. Among other issues, theres also the fact that most viewers have high expectations and very little patience
honestly IMHO the less Mando takes off his helmet the better.  A huge point of his character is literally "Don't take off the helmet". So finding every excuse to have him take off that helmet kind of defeats that point. We don't want to run into another "Halo" situation now do we?
Hahaha😂  This one was “tight!”
I could use a coffee as well.
I didn't like either season, except for the end of season 2. Good to know I'm not missing anything by catching up.
Lots of street directional markings.
point making segues are tight
Oh my gawd that was SO clever. Amazing!
Amusing and accurate analysis. 👏👏👏😂
pretty accurate portrayal of the show's gist from 2:50 to 3:40
COFFEE SIDE QUEST!!!!!!!!
I can’t believe Disney stole the side character plot from the icon Inter goes to the store and gets cream for Producer guy Coffee
Why the heck didn’t you mention the destruction of the darksaber?
Somebody put a side quest in the middle of the pitch meeting, kinda like a reese's peanut butter cup but less tasty
4:02 I drive on the Florida Turnpike and the drivers around Boca Raton are idiots.
This was genious! 👍👍👍
So, what's the backstory on that toilet ? How'd it get so full of turds ? We need a sequel, , , trilogy
Well, I wonder if Ryan is enjoying his new car and I hope he had fun driving up the coast. Oh, hi IRS.
Oh my gaad it's lore!!!
Of course, what we are ALL wondering is.. Did the intern WASH HIS HANDS?
The green screen background for the car travel scene was really good. Much better than the office scenes
Bye bye Star Wars
“Super easy, barely an inconvenience” could describe every single piece of conflict this season
Suggestions for a Pitch Meeting, the Movie Speed. Old school Keanu Reeves  movie
10/10
Season 3 was so bad I think I’m done with the show. Disney’s just feeding off nostalgia and forgetting that not everybody who likes the mandalorian likes the original Star Wars movies
I need to see a supha ninjas pitch meeting
Remember when writers had so many ideas and things they wanted to do that the season for a 45 minute show was more than 20 episodes?  Yeah the production and special effects weren’t as pretty, but jeezus, at least the whole season couldn’t be whittled down to a half hour.  We’ve seen movies with more plot in way less time.  20 years ago this plot wouldn’t have even gotten a tv movie.
Side quest episode was great.
Hey smart guy.....we've been conditioned to accept and even like side quests. This is the way
I swear Disney has no idea whatsoever what people like about Star Wars
Loved this! 😂😍👏🏼 Spot on as always Ryan 🎉🎉🎉
The Intern was amazing.  Probably the most hilarious thing in Pitch Meetings yet.
Bad baby no squeezie!
That is some good coffee!
This one was one of the best
And i was in fact not cool with those 2 characters taking up 30 mins of a 45 min episode.
Love the intern driving all the way to Japan 🤣 at 2:25
I appreciate the extra effort put into this one
yea I feel cheated by this pitch meeting just as I felt watching the season.
This is the way. Nice.
One thing that struck me about all of the after OT shows and movies was that the Empire is clearly based on the Na... those German guys led by the guy with the Charlie Chaplin mustache (their main forces are even called Storm-troopers for crying out loud). After WWII the Allies put so much effort into eliminating every vestige of the  previous regime that even in modern Germany you risk getting arrested for hailing a cab with the wrong hand. After the Death Star II was destroyed and the rebellion finally rose to power they just let the remnants of the Empire wander off into the far reaches of the galaxy with fleets of warships, brigades of troops, and some of the most advanced weapon systems known. Moff Gideon, apparently one of the most notorious war criminals of the Imperial age, gets arrested and then his transport is attacked and he goes missing and the New Republic... DOESN'T MENTION THIS TO ANYONE INCLUDING THE FORCES THEY HAVE PATROLLING THE AREA WHERE THEY LOST CONTACT TO THE POINT WHERE THEY LITERALLY OVERLOOK HIM SETTING UP AN ADVANCED WEAPONS FACILITY ON MANDALOR WHERE HE'S CONSTRUCTING AN ARMY OF FORCE WIELDING CLONES AND AN ARMY OF BESKAR WEARING FLYING STORM-TROOPER!!!
Probably your best one yet!
DO GHOSTED!!!!
that was absolutely brilliant. dispite literally imitating exactly what was wrong with mandalorian season 3 it was somehow still more creative and entertaining.
Of course viewership is down, I’m only halfway through the season, the filler and Baby Yoda cuteness was only ever gonna get them so far. In season 1 they had the advantage of being the first Star Wars live action show, in season 2 they brought back a ton of loved characters, season 3 was their first time really being judged fairly and they failed miserably.   The boba fett show shits all over any other live action show so far.
Nailed another one… as if it was super easy, barely an inconvenience!
Little bit of subplot, that plunger is for sinks, not toilets, which is the reason for the toilet being such a problem for store-owner-guy in the first place.  Well played, Mr. George.
always good 🎉
Oh, you missed a cameo. Tim Meadows.
“Intern Guy” - New series
I look forward to the The Mandalorian Season 3 Pitch Meeting Spin Off "TMS3PM: Song of the Intern Guy"
Huh, interesting. The premiere of season 3 was a disappointment? I guess it makes sense. I missed the first 3 weeks. Didn't even realized it had been released. That said, I caught up and enjoyed the season. (Even the filler episodes. Christopher Lloyd is just an awesome actor. Even if his mobility is quite decreased.)
That side quest was tight.
Mmm, fun with stock video!
Yo Ryan you have to do a pitch meeting on Beau is Afraid...just watched it and ummm yea wierd movie
I was really expecting to hear some BTTF jokes, you know, The Man in the DeLorean is in the Mandalorian...
These are always great & funny but I think this one had me laugh the loudest and longest especially with the coffee side quest 🤣
Finally we get to see what Ryan's bathroom looks like.
It _is_ getting annoying -- well past disappointing -- that these series don't get to the story they supposedly want to tell.  It's the reason I'm starting to favor foreign shows: they don't eff around, and when it ends, it ends.  No trying to stretch it out because god forbid they'd have to try to sell another idea, so they milk the in-production show instead.  And this is happening across ALL platforms.  So aggravating.
Loved the bit with the intern, quality content
Ngl, this was the best pitch meeting I’ve watched, the coffee mission had my laughing
That intern has a really expensive and TIGHT vehicle for an intern ..... Oh wait ....... It's Disney ......It'd be super easy, barely an inconvenience for an intern at Disney. I guess it's unclear so .... Shut up about the intern's expensive TIGHT vehicle!
If you can read between the lines, the tangent cream/trip to store is very funny, on point, and related to Mandalorian. I like the first two seasons only, hmmmph
Omg that intern spinoff, I love this.
Awww man, we’re never going to see intern guy again. 😢
You should really try for more diversity hires among your interns
1:16 - 1:33 The Flash. Dr Strange. SIMPerman (Yeah i addressed it but still)
Really loved the Intern stretching out the story - that is so true.  However, the last point about removing the helmet kinda ignores the principle of what the start of Mandalorian 3 was about. His removing his helmet is a breach of Mandalorian code, which states that they can not remove their helmet in front of ANY living thing. Him removing his helmet would mean we would have to sit through another 3 episodes of him having another bath.... no thank you :D
Hilarious. Exciting new direction for the channel. (Invest in anti-reflection spray for those glasses ;-)
Side quests are tight!
The mandalorian never takes off his helmet tho.
"...and they destroy them all using a button that destroys them all!" 😭
The intern’s side quest should’ve been at least 2 minutes longer to be proportionately accurate.
Nailed it
love the fake moustache on a real moustage
I'm just sticking to Star War video games
Best star wars in 40 years
"No that wouldn't work!"
😆😂🤣😄😁 👍
Hey! I just realized you're ryan george from pitch meeting! You look a lot like that other guy! Almost the same voice even. Yeah...jeff foxworthy.. thats the guy.
The producer is actually doing a meta thing here. He is soft-introducing the intern character into tge pitch meeting universe, see if it clicked with the audience while serving the narration of this pitch meeting. Brilliant work producer
No Ryan, thank you for making these pitch meetings 😊
How’d y’all feel about mando season 3? I didn’t like the smaller characters movements, kinda killed the immersion for me.. seeing the half blinks and the unnatural foot movements was almost gut wrenching lol
*That intern side plot was essential to this whole story. Definitely didn't need to be cut at all* 😅
Hi Ryan who made the pitch meeting, I enjoyed watching this pitch meeting by Ryan.  Also hello intern guy it was nice to meet you ok bye
EXACTLY!!!!!!!!!!!
Disney is ruining Cinema and Television
I was laughing so hard at the intern bit that was seriously ingenious
"Maybe we should have the main characters be the main characters in their own shows" - The Witcher and season 2 where Geralt (THE The Witcher) is basically a sideline character comes to mind as an example
Having like one or two episodes of a season without the title character being the focus is actually surprisingly common these days. Like the "Doctor-lite" episodes of modern Doctor Who that go all the way back to the 2007 Weeping Angel debut episode "Blink" (which is around when Moffat coined the term "Doctor-lite" )
Belabouring the joke is tight
That nail got hit on the head pretty damn hard this Pitch Meeting. My god. Well done, sir.
He never misses.
I give you this like and favorite my good sir
I'm amazed there wasn't a single Bo-Katan joke in this episode
Is Moff Gideon like Dr. Doofensmirtz and he's compelled to put a self destruct button on everything?  Mando season 3 was such garbage LOL!!!
Plz, never script your endings 🙏
Absolutely loved it, please do Picard season 3!
Sorry Disney, i'm not watching a shitty show to understand a decent show, so this entire season is a gigantic pass.
Complete overkill but painfully true
This entire pitch meeting is amazing, but I stand by that side quest episode. I was so intensely interested in what the hell was happening and it turns out to be relevant to the cloning program stuff, so I wasn't mad. I was kind of shocked that I cared at all tbh and I would watch it again just on its own haha
I wonder if Ryan George, Critical Drinker, and the like are bringing in more money from their review videos than Disney is from their shows.   We are definitely witnessing the end of the entrainment industry.   In a few years all content will be AI generated in minutes. You won’t even need a prompt because it’ll just know what you’d like and custom make content for you.
This pitch is genius. It captures exactly the feeling you get watching Mandalorian season 3
When did TV shows become this dumb? Ryan does a great job of pointing out how stupid these plot points are... Yet they're everywhere.
The moment I saw lizzo on the screen I immediately just shut off the show, literally lol.  Nah, man. Just nah.
They went woke
😂
Yup, weve checked out of star wars. If the force is female now, good luck selling tickets smh. Not against women, this just isnt their space. But hey, watching Disney crash and burn their IPs is TIGHT!
Glad I stopped watching at ep 2. Seems like a real piece of shit
They put in lizzo and jack cuck. But not boba fett
This season lost me. No more disney star wars for me lol. It's so bad
INTERN GUY!?!  I'M ONBOARD!!!!  Oh...never see him again?  Well.  That's disappointing.  In an unrelated note, you think that's why people are not liking the Mandolorian, because the side quest people are not shown again?  Seems like it.  Better get the Spinoff-o-matic 9000 going!
Infinitely better than the actual Mandalorian.
The cream side quest is important and should be considered for a spin off osti
Well, at least there wasn’t a voice over like from Avatar the last airbender to explain this side journey
Hilarious.
Pulling names out of a hat, brilliant!
Easily the highest production cost for an episode ever
Producer Guys intern side quests are tight.
I swear I saw a reflection in the window of vehicle of someone playing the flute for the soundtrack.
Monologuing after the plan has already failed is tight.
dummydata
To be fair, Dr. Pershing side story is the best thing in all 3 seasons of the Mandalorian It's like someone from the Andor team walked into the wrong room during production
The shot of the car next to the ocean was exactly the right length - just long enough where you wonder how long its going to go on.
Personally think it would've been funnier had Inetern guy never returned with the Coffee and it's never explained. Loved it as always though.
This was a fun pitch meeting but just wanted to know if you were doing a little teaser at the end that you're finally going to maybe do The last of Us next week maybe. I mean I don't know how hard it is. I mean I guess it might be difficult since it's taking so long but please do it sometime soon. Ryan please
This cannot be rated high enough.  The brilliance is unequalled
Haha, good one.
The best part of the whole side quest gag was the way they just played an absurdly long shot of the car driving along the coast. Perfect roast of the show.
I can't wait to see store guy again he was my favorite his story still open we need to know who jacked up the tolit
This is the best Pitch Meeting EVER!!
The best pitch meeting I've seen so far
What an amazing episode! Just wanted Bo Katan's plotline to be mentioned, like, at all... Anyway let me get all the way off your back about Bo Katan.  PS: What a cursed thumbnail, thanks I hate it.
It’s a great time to cancel Disaster Disney plus. What a waste of money
Why does the door say "Disney"? They didn't make the series.
We can really see that Jon Favreau had nothing to do with the season. Every time I see Kathleen Kennedy’s face I literally wanna throw up.
I love the end things so much! 😅 So creative and original every time!
😂😂😂😂 I see what you did there. Best Pitch Meeting Ever
Pedro Pascal has lost every credibility after doing "Last of Us" and this Disney mess. Go woke, etc..
best pitch meeting in ages
How is it I've never noticed the light glare in the glasses until the 2nd intern in the "breakroom" and now I see it is everywhere!
Incredible how the intern was able to drive all the way to Korea in such a short time
Stock footage of China freaking killed me😂😂
STUPID!  lol, new catch phrase?    The side quest was utter perfection.
You outdid yourself with this one. The intern side mission is an all timer!
Ryans Hairstyle pitch meeting no srsly how do Ive been trying to replicate and I cant
Please do a pitch meeting for Andor. It's, by far, the best production ever made in the Star Wars universe
The ending goodbyes always feels like he’s reading from a AI made script that he train to be Ryan
Din Djarin joined Boba and Obi-Wan to the "No longer main character of the show" club ;_;  . Thanks for video it was entertaining.
Now you need to start a series with intern guy which half way through the second or first episode it just becomes a pitch meeting
"So what's up with your intern?"  "Don't worry about that we won't see him again" XD lol
these seven minutes were better than the first seven episodes of the third season.
Good, so it wasn't just me that didn't care for this season. It was so boring, hopefully Mando does some cooler stuff when he's in 3 episodes of andors next season.
that intern has a nice car.
please do an andor pitch meeting 🥺
Cle-ver! Cle-veeeerrrr!   ;)
Disney: Forcing people to have no choice but to watch all our shows or they will be lost is TIGHT!
Very good! I laughed so much
I used to get mad at Disney, but now, I'm just laughing as they fall apart.  Thank you Disney for failing again.
pedro pascal taking care of little kids is tight
It's a masterpiece of plot, intrigue and an ending that falls short from expectations. Just wonderful!!!! 🥲
Where’s the Cylons’s?
"You're doing a Pitch Meeting that introduces two new characters? Will it be hard to cast two new actors?"  "Actually, it'll be super easy, barely an inconvenience."
First rate cinematography for a side quest is tight
The coffee guy's journey was thrilling :D :D !! Great Idea !
We were not prepared for such a masterpiece!!!
Just finished washing Season 3 and I can say this is a Pitch Perfect Meeting! #ThisIsTheWay #LoveTheInterns
Have you done A League Of There Own
When Star Wars and Disney have lost Pitch Meeting....
Ryan did an admirable job pulling substance from something so insubstantial.
So Pedro just recording boothed the whole season?
Genius, man. Pure genius.
We need more side character scenes
Lexus IS500 (V8) is faster, more comfortable, better made, cheaper to repair and ultra reliable...🫣
Please do Rubber
Change of scenery was TIGHT!
I think the first 3-4 episodes were rough but i also believe most of season 3 budget went into the last 2 episodes lol.  I was disappointed that Bo was chosen to be the main role while din took more of a supportive role. Some people say it’s so din can get back to Bounty hunting with simple one off problem episodes especially since it’s required for grogu’s apprentice training but they foreshadowed him helping the other mandalorians pretty heavily.  I feel like he could’ve totally been the leader/played the main role and went on his bounties to retrieve leftover beskar and other important items they needed to reclaim the surface. Returning making a few decisions before peacing out to grab the next thing.
I thought there was a SUV ad in the middle of the video!😅
"Star Wars Villains love somehow returning!" 🤣 the force was strong with that one
The side quest was awesome!
I enjoyed this Pitch Meeting more than I enjoyed season three of The Mandalorian, which I have not watched at all.  They can keep making the show all they'd like.  I'll keep watching the Pitch Meetings.
The intern: Do you have any coffee for me? The other intern: Yes I do sir! Is honestly what I thought was going to be the interaction
Interns were 👌
LMFAO!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is gold
This one is a classic. Mando season 3 was absolutely terrible. He's not even the star of his own show. I'm absolutely done with any more Disney Star Wars
😭😭
Genius! Except Star Wars always has been an ensemble thing with different characters in different places. But I get where people come from.
Ryan, you're a genius!!
You literally ruined his fucking helmet lol
Lmfao
Omg this is the funniest one yet. I died 😂
I still enjoyed this season of Mando, but it wasn’t great. Weirdly, the infamous episode with Jack Black and Lizzo was my favourite episode, because it explored droid sentience, and sentience in general. It had a very dark undertone beneath all the hijinks. I also loved the coruscant episode, I know many hated it, but it showed how a justified revolutionary movement often doesn’t necessarily know what to do once the war is over, and can go down equally dark paths.
Intern breaks the meta/lore!!!
somehow returning  sigh
This comment is shadowbanned respond and prove me wrong
that side quest bro 😭😭😭
Thank you Pitch Meeting guy - I already hated season 3 - now I despise it! Good job - Barley and internvenious!
Intern guy died returning to his home planet
I'm surprised that they didn't mention Grogu piloting around the corpse of the droid IG-12. Then one episode later IG-12 unceremoniously dies again.
WE WANT THE INTERN-CUT  75 EXTRA MINUTES OF DRIVING TO FIND THE CREAM  20 MINUTES OF PLUMBING-RELATED CHICANERY  A SHOE-HORNED IN CAMEO BY BEN STILLER  WE CRAVE THE INTERN-CINEMATIC-UNIVERSE (THE ICU)
The quest for the cream was way better that the Mandalorian subplot.
Holy shit... how far away is the store?
I wish i could like this a million times
🤣🤣🤣
New characters are tight!
Side quest looked like a Nissan commercial.....
Haha good stuff. Accepting turds for payment is TIGHT!
A more compelling side story than what Mando did. And bravo was pissed when it cut away... then it dawned on me haha well played
Please please, do one on Helluva boss, or Murder drones (maybe once the first season is fully out) I know they are smaller web series that were not actually pitched to anyone, but i'm sure they would make amazing pitch meetings :D
Wow, this is something never seen before. The world building here is amazing, knowing what is going on outside of the Pitch Meetings.
Pure genius
Please do pitch meetings for Shrek 1, Shrek 2, Shrek The Third and Shrek Forever After that would be awesome
Really committed to side quest!
The Mandalorian Order was founded by a crazy old man in a time traveling car, he was the original Man in DeLorean!
BEST ONE YET!
I want to see the pitch meeting for Intern Sidequest: Coffee, Cream IV and the one for the Intern prequel Plumber: Rise of the Turdherder.
Freaking brilliant!
Yeah Disney's destroying star wars. What started out as their best original project has quickly become a boring slog and I have no interest in season 4
What is a Mandalorian pitch meeting without several side quests?
Awesome, saves me 10 hours :)
Best pitch meeting yet. Don’t see why we need Producer and Writer Guy in it at all any more.
The Mandalorian: driven by video game/mcguffin plot design
Best pitch meeting yet. Don’t see why we need Producer Guy and Writer Guy in it at all any more.
i would have sat through 5 mins of that intern side story easy
Genius. Just... genius.
Perfect.
As usual this was an absolute joy to watch.
The celebrity hat was terrific. I now know what a Lizzo looks like. That episode was lame and I’m glad I fell asleep for pretty much the entire random love story episode
Same as in the Mandalorian, I very much enjoyed the guy-verse worldbuilding
It's all funny cause it's all true. But man, that effort he put in this one though - AMAZING!
Watching a 7 minute pitch meeting in place of an entire season of mediocre television is TIGHT!
They really needed to get rid of that scene that shows Gideon tracking them step by step...also his control room/Cloning lab has force fields and troopers on one side, and then the other side is just a massive hangar that anyone can just drop into from the surface, feels like those security measures could have been distributed a bit more evenly
The greatest side quest ever
5:30 the dual concepts of Moff knowing where they are going, and that the clone farm had an easy access self destruct feature, is just the worst kind of writing "eh whatever" to audiences
😂 this is the best pitch meeting yet!
If you get it, you get it.... #spotonwelldone
This is the real way.😂😂😂
Intern f-ing Rules #boomercomment
I've been a pitch meeting fan for a long time, but, Ryan just outdid himself, here ! Now I want an entire season of the intern's adventures... Not ! Perfectly captured the spirit of this season !
I can't wait for intern to get his own show and have entire episodes where he's barely in it and producer with writer guys take over the episodes.
As a fan of the series it was evident to me when the writing and directing changed hands and it didn't start with this show.
This was like half pitch meeting/half Ryan George video
Genius and totally on point.
The Star Wars universe is like a coloring book that gets weirder and weirder. On fine day the kid in us is going to give up.
Djin Jaren took his helmet off as many times as Boba Fett should have in his show. Also it should have been his show not Mando 2.5 sometimes.
You should do a pitch meeting for the movie Smile. There’s a lot in that movie that’s super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Ok,ok, ok, to be honest I was 20% ok with Jack Black. But the fact that I had never heard of Lizzo prior yet still recognized her as being someone intended for the viewer to recognize does say it all. Loved Chris Loyd, but he hasn't exactly been in the spotlight as much as the other two lately so it worked.  50% approval reduction for the casting, another 50% deduction for their executions. I loved seeing Jack Black in that roll but it didn't feel like we were even in the Star Wars Universe.
Looks like Christopher Lloyd needs 1.21 Gigawatts...again.
AHAHAH, so good
Funny how you did not mention Bo Katan Even though this is the Bo Katan Show
I was trying to watch it even tho i didn't watch boba Fett but then i saw them fighting that monster on the beach and that was it for me
I really hope LucasFilm is watching this
They destroyed Luke, botched Kenobi, and defiled Boba Fett.
Ouch. This one went so off the rails. Little tip: Don't try to fix what isn't broken. ;)
OMG the side quests!!! ❤❤❤😂😂😂
Enable captions to find out who Boca 10 is.
This show is like protago-nick from Rick and Morty used his super powers somewhere 🤔
That's THIS show!!! LMAO
So funny and so spot on! Thanks Ryan!
''Somehow'' is now my favourite Star Wars word :)
LOL
I will accept turds as payment.
Lol, using a screen rant article is funny
tht 'stupid' was full of emotion, so relatable
Haven't seen a single ep of mandolorian & just came here to witness Ryan George's comedic brilliance and I don't think I've missed anything or been spoiled lol
Yup, the meta in this is well and truly off the charts! Nice!
I love how the shop owner doesn't just sell the cream, but exchanges it for an extra task. Very accurate representation of other shows! xD
they destroy them all using a button that destroys them all
Such a brilliant channel
Half way I thought, I got it the show is boring, I already knew it
I didn't watch S3 so was unsure if I would enjoy this Pitch Meeting. When the intern showed up, I knew I made the right decision!
The cream fetch quest ftw
Savage!
Please reintroduce your intro music/sound that you used to have in earlier videos...it was very iconic of pitch meeting
Ok so i missed the memo that explains how Luke could be in the show 100years before he was born!?
Side-quests are tight.
this was brilliant
I think this is your best work yet
Bring the intern back
Hilarious
Star Wars really is screwed huh
Gold!❤ I love this
"Star wars bad guys freaking LOVE somehow coming back!"
If I had a nickel for every time in a season finale of a prestige tv show Pedro pascal was lead down a hallway by two guards and then takes those guards out to save his surrogate kid was waiting execution id have 2 nickels which isn’t a lot but it’s really fucking weird it happened twice within 3 months of eachother
I really enjoy your clips homie BUT I wld be remiss if I didn’t mention tht my grandfather use to tell me NEVER EVER EVER EVER trust a man with 2 first names! Haha 😅 ✌️
Legendary job Ryan!!
Enjoyed the jokes about sidequests. The sidequests though have been great at filling in the lore, and making it feel like a living, breathing universe with a New Republic dealing with the mess of issues spanning many systems.
For some reason the second shot with the car going back to the office was so funny to me 😂
Wait wait wait! Who Clog the Toilet and Why?!?! I need to know now...
Here's the deal ... The helmet thing is wicked stupid. You can tell extra for sure with the kid wandering around on the beach. It just looks stupid. Hollywood is so bankrupt.
The intern side plot had me legit laughing so hard I had to pause the video. Satire perfection.
If they had only shown his face at this one time, at the end, that would have been so much better.
need more intern in future episodes
"They have popsicles, but they glow because it's spacey." Hollywood is so bankrupt.
Thank goodness I watched this episode otherwise the other show with the intern would not have made sense how he got reunited with the cream 😂
I think intern guy needs his own episode 😂
I wish Ryan would start saying “I don’t know” every episode again
Long long driving scenes are tight!
Why would Mando take his helmet off again? What a weird thing to bring up as a criticism. The first 3 episodes were him atoning for doing that exact thing. He's not just going to do it again immediately?
There should be a way to give you more thumbs ups.
I should’ve just waited for the Pitch Meeting to come out - much more entertaining.
Never change Ryan, never change.
This has got to be one of the most accurate pitch meetings. Nailed it 👌
Mandy season 3 was pretty bad. Final episode the red guards swing all slow and missing 😂
I can already hear the re-visited pitch meeting now about the joke taking too long, but it was the point, and I loved it the entire time
I mean, Vader was the pioneer of the "super interesting character whose face we never see" trope, so fair's fair. (Honestly it takes me out of the immersion when Mando removes his helmet, I wanna imagine I am Mando!)
Noup. That's a false equivalence. The side quest actually moved the plot forward.
Epic! Always amazed by the simplicity and complexity of these sketches.
This is my new favorite episode
Snape kills Dumbledore!
this is awesome 😂
We're going to need a separate spin-off series on this channel that chronicles the unnecessary adventures of intern guy #1.
The Mandalorian sucks because Disney sucks.
Ok, but why are we not talking about the expanded Pitch Meeting universe? There's more lore and characters, and what are the implications of all this, you know?!
😂😂😂😂😂 I hope the writers are watching this.
Intern spin-off…. Now.
The best episode of the whole season is obvs the intern getting the cream.
The mandalorian was in one episode of boba Fett first of all secondly yeah season 3 was kind of all over the place
I never root for writer guy, but seeing him disappointed at the end at not having the face reveal of Mando because he is already booked in another show doing the same role was a bit sad. Producer guy really doesn't gives a crap XD
Intern Guy felt like he was going on a bunch of video game style side quests and I just want to see more of his adventures.
Where John wick 4 pitch meeting?
This is cinema
Just an almost infinite round of applause to this one. Absolutely brilliant
This isn’t a pitch meeting…it’s an introduction to the Ryan George Cinematic Universe…
I can't believe I'm saying this but Mando season 3 compared to obi Wan was... Nope nope, still leagues better but complete garbage none the less. Can we fire and blacklist everyone from these 2 shows and get the andor people to take over?  How people are able to hobble together such egregious trash in 2023 is astonishing :/
Next Pitch Meeting will be randomly in the middle of a skit on Ryans main channel called "First guy to pitch a movie".
very funny very boring good job
As someone who thinks season 3 was the weakest yet, this pitch meeting pretty much nails all the faults. Great stuff as always 👍
As a huge fan of The Mandalorian...this still made me laugh to the point of tears. Thank you...
Star Wars bad guys love "somehow returning". A-mazing!
You should do some pitch meetings for some of the real old classics. Like Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz, From here to Eternity, or Ben Hur. Or any of the many great movies made before 1970.
Getting coffee is super difficult and a huge inconvenience!
The intern sub-plot is tight.
Um yea I want more intern. Can he get his own spinoff?
I was wondering what if ryan talked like this with his family.  Girlfriend: honey, how was the sex? Ryan: Super Easy, Barely an Inconvenience.
I've started calling Mandalorian "Side Quest: The Series"
I was wondering what if ryan talked like this with his family.  Girlfriend: honey, how was the sex? Ryan: Super Easy, Barely an Inconvenience.

I love the ending.
Best Pitch Meeting so far and much better than Disney poop product. Well done, funny and epic.
hey Ryan, I know I'm really late on this but have you seen Swiss Army Man? I was thinking you would have a fun time watching it.
The way your videos have evolved 😁 makes me smile bro. Good shit as always 🫡
I actually saw that cameo episode more as "Christopher Lloyd, and whoever we can get for free, cos Lloyd cost a lot to get here".. Do you suppose Lizzo and Jack Black took turds as payment?
This show is gone to shit
Great summary of how s**t the writing was again! Do better Disney! Much much better!
The side episode was the best one!
I came here to thumb up the video and leave as I've not got around to watching this season yet.
I legitimately feel like they should have called BOBF Mando Season 3, and this season 4. That would have more clearly established that Din is not THE Mandolorian anymore, and that the show is now going to focus more on the group as a whole and jump between multiple characters.
The Pitch Meeting theme do be slapping
Intern guy really, really needs to have his own show. And then producer guy can take it over.
One of the all time great pitches! Hilarious!❤
God damn I hate disney
The bit-part sidequest was both very funny - and really highlighted just how irritating it is as an idea.  Well done - this time.
This episode is genius and exactly how the show felt lol
I was one of the people lost because I never finished Book of Boba Fett.
Thank you for this!  Somehow it soothes my destroyed hopes and feeling that I was emotionally raped by Disney.  WTH were they thinking!?!?!
That bug-eyed Mandalorian on the thumbnail is so cursed lmao
but I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE INTERN NOW
Good idea, but ran a bit long (I know, you meant to do that).  It’s just I can’t spend more than 10 minutes a day on Dizny.
I watched the show mostly to get the references on the pitch meeting 😅
"STUPID" lmao hilarious
Ryan, when are we going to see where Intern Guy got his orange tie? That needs to be a plot point when you do the Intern Guy origin story.
Hope the Internguys return one day. They deserved better than being a stretch plot device.
I'm stoked to see epic vistas of the great outdoors in the Ryanverse. We all knew there had to be those spaces between all the people standing around and talking about things for the first time
It's not a pitch meeting anymore, it's a Disney meeting.  Us writers would have got away with it if it wasn't for  you meddling higher ups.
I literally stood and applauded the intern side-quest. Particularly the stock 'car driving' footage. Bravo, my friend . . . bravo.
Season 3 was so bad it finally got me to cancel Disney Plus. Besides Andor, the Marvel and Star Wars content has been so disappointing.
The looooore!
I really want more small stories added to the pitch meetings please
Yeah, I haven't even started watching season 3 yet.
top notch stuff fella(s) ! keep em coming
Could the Intern cream side-quest got its own show? Maybe we would saw some pitch meeting in that!
Another show with Daddy Pascal, where in the 3rd episode, the focus entirely shifted to another set of characters, but that was by HBO and I actually loved it.
I very much enjoyed the intern. We should see more of him.
This season was basically “The Book of Bo Katan”
How does Pitch Meeting continue being better and better with every video? Unclear.
This season was basically “The Book of Bo Katan”
The side quest scene with the Intern character is clearly a diss on how the Mandolarian show and it was portrayed perfectly. More focus on the side quest than rather the main plot
Someone watches the Critical Drinker. Great episode BTW
I've not seen the Mandalorian but from this I've gathered that it's basically an RPG but as a TV show.
Japan? :)
What the heck is happening in this episode  Are these references or smt? I haven't watched the series
Exactly!
like why would he show his face at the end he went to a lot of trouble to get redeemed, its not like hes gonna keep going to the waters every time that be stupid, his main character is focus on the task and honour his creed and code altho it would have been nice and sweet it dont make sense so am glad they didnt do that tbh
But now I want to see more of intern guy 🥺
The funny thing was that I actually liked the whole thing with the reformed scientist guy. They just decided to put the whole thing in one episode and then never actually connected it to Mando or even the main plot.
brilliant !!
First
That was a great episode of the intern show!
Great Stuff, as always!
The line about watching everything they make encapsulates my thoughts on where disney has taken the Marvel and Star Wars franchises.
What if the intern came back to read the outro once in awhile, wouldn't that be tight?
Actually, getting creamer was not easy, and very inconvenient
The car shot that went on for way too long had me in stitches.
Best. Pitch. Meeting. Ever.
Don't get why so much hate for Disney for giving important plots in other shows. Marvel has been doing that to their comic fans since forever, it's the same formula passed on to the movies and TV shows and now infecting star wars
Sooo... Mando and Grogu are able to foil Gideon's plot because his cloning machine was apparently designed by Doofenshmirtz.
More entertaining than Mando season two, that's where I left it because the side quests were beginning to get a bit tedious.
Literal Art as usual. Thanks for making the world a better place!
This might be the best Pitch Meeting episode because it so excellently calls out the ridiculousness going on at Disney.  We love 'em, keep it coming!
It's beautiful. You've outdone yourself.
Is Store Guy part of the Pitch Meeting Cinematic Universe (PMCU)?
True. This season was so bad because Mando was a side character This was the Bo Katan show instead.
The Ryanverse is expanding...
GENIUS. 😂
I didn't even try to watch that awful season... Youtubers tearing the episodes apart was way more content than any of the actual episodes...
Make the hat trick recurring
Comedic genius
Pulling random stars’ names out of a hat—brilliant!!
Super easy barely an inconvenience!!!
Disney is dissappointed they got less viewers, yet they keep getting in Jon and Dave's way. Kennedy should be fired already. Boba was epic in season 2, yet Disney ruined the Boba show and reuinited Din and Grogu there.
The intern "will never be seen again" sounded crazy ominous
He also put a side quest into the first season pitch meeting, I like the continuity :D
Is rather watch Ryan George than most of Disney. Yes.
ok Ludwig Göransson, you can move over because Ryan was able to recreate the exact same musical vibe for intern guy's side quest...
I think in fairness the assistant's car should move in slow motion. That would give a more accurate picture of how this season has been.
Bro actually put a side quest with side characters in a pitch meeting episode 💀
This is brilliant!
This season was so trash but at least it gave us a funny intern bit I guess
"What we have in the Thumb Star is a biggest weapon of mass destruction the universe has ever seen. Luckily, they included a button, right here, that'll blow the entire thing up!"  "How do we find this button sir?"  "That's the best part! They built a corridor that leads right to it! You just zip in, follow a straight line, and fire! Haha!"  "Why would they do that?"  "You got me. If I was building it, I would've left that part out."
Your illustration for why side quests suck was TIGHT!!
Best video yet. I love the way Ryan uses actual scenarios to explain the stupidity of some movie decisions. Love you Ryan.
Genius 😂
I haven’t laughed my head off for so long! Great job, Ryan! You’re a comedic genius! 😂😂😂
You know, I clicked on this video to watch the producer guy say “tight”, not to watch a side quest about the intern going to the store and- oh wait a minute…
After watching 2:28: Whats so funny? You wouldnt get it...
Wow that was an unexpectedly great summary
i think this was some of your best work ryan sir
😂😂😂
Funny
Completely inaccurate, interns can't afford cars lol
I never liked Mandalorian.. Felt more like a video game..
"people will never get disinterested in this kind of thing"🤣🤣🤣   Disney logic
One man and 7:03 of time was more entertaining than eight episodes of The Mandalorian. Maybe Disney should hire you.
That is the funniest parody of Disney's shameless Bait and Switch writing style for all their popular I.P. shows they think they can use to make people watch stuff their not interested in.
I get the feeling disney is run just by clones judging on this. And THAT explains a lot!!!
Should have mentioned how the mandos all left 1 guy to hold the troopers off... who basically just takes them out solo and dies at the hands of 3 guards who he holds his own against for abit.... makes you wonder if they just all just hung about to mop them up...
The jetpacks failing to keep up with a dragon but seemingly be able to go from ground level, through the atmosphere and into space was interestingly convenient...
this is brilliant, intern guy touch was epic.
Stretched out pointless side quests are Tiiiiiiiiiiiiggggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhtttttttttttttttttttttttttttt!
That was epic🤣🤣🤣
This episode of Pitch Meeting has had more thought put into it than the entire Mandalorian.
It didn't take long for Disney to ruin mando
Disney had a perfect show and a perfect ending with the two seasons of the Mandalorian. This is what green and a lack of any artistic sense does to any intellectual property when handled by people who only care about the bottom line. Greed it's what's for dinner.
this episode took a completely different turn and I loved it
There’s not even a spoiler warning
The pitch meeting about season 3 was waaay better than season 3
1:48 "... and one day, I dream of becoming a tight producer guy myself" I really hope his dream comes true. He certainly has the looks for the position
Oh no!! If we're never seeing Intern Guy again that means he's getting replaced
do more series
We need more intern guys in your videos, it'll help expand the Pitch Meeting Universe 🌌
The Mandalorians are hanging out on a beach where they keep getting attacked by gigantic monsters "Weird place to hang out hey"
The fact they waited until the last two episodes for the plot to get going
Watching this pitch meeting makes me glad I didn't waste my time watching the rest of this season. When it became clear the third episode was just gonna be about these randos from the first season I tapped out and never felt enough interest to continue.
Best one yet!
Episode 6 made me cry tears of disgust.
I'm only here for the intern.
I might be a sucker for new stuff, but to say it with the words of Dana White about every UFC: "This is the greatest pitch meeting of all time"
Yep. "Watch everything we make or else". Such a disappointing season. They could have been smart and kept two stories going, one with Grogu training as a Jedi and the other with Mando continuing his adventures.
Gideon kind of stupid for being smart he goes how dare you kill my clone before the come to life, also Gideon leaves clones unguarded and control panel on and easy active self destruction, the path leading to him is the same path as the clones, also how does Mando know about the clones
THE UNIVERSE EXPANDS!!!
The Budget for these episodes are going up for hiring more Ryans. 😂
the coffee subplot was genius.  I really want to watch Pitch Meeting episodes to see episodes about coffee subplots
I know its a joke, but I seriously dont think its Pedro in the suit ost of the time. Ita a perfect scam, show his face once, then cut him lose and replace him with an extra with a helmet covering every inch of his face.  Just Imagine how much money they save.
We want the intern back!!
😂😂😂😂😂 the intern tangent
Did Ryan George or the Producer Guy misuse the word disinterested?
i was almost expecting that intern to kill some lvl 1 rats in a basement lol
This really reveals how appallingly badly written the show is. As if it wasn't already apparent.
i really enjoyed the first two seasons of this show, but by the time season 3 came around, I no longer gave a crap about Star Wars and probably won't watch another Star Wars movie, tv show or cartoon.  This is the way.
This was fucking incredible!  You nailed it in the best possible way hahahaha
Awesome comedy and commentary.
I demand that we see the intern again
The budgets on these things have really skyrocketed
Hahahahaha. This one was amazing! Also... I was hoping cashier guy's mustache would have continued to fall down his face! lol. Also... more of the expanded Ryan universe please? MORE RYANS!!!! hahahaha
Crazy thing is... it's true. I can't even argue it. All of it. It's all true.
We need a show that is about the main character who isn't overshadowed by a female version of them.
An extensive side plot about side characters we will most likely never see again........ I see what you did there Ryan.
Oh i get it! this is a representation of the unnecessary side quest in the show!
What annoyed me about the episode with those two side characters is it was well written, directed and acted, and I was intrigued by the world building... BUT IT'S NOT THE MANDALORIAN! So, I sat there telling myself "don't worry, I'm sure this will all be relevant in the next episode, or at the very least by the end of the season. They did this for a good reason, I'm sure of it. I trust the team."... Aaaand then we get to the penultimate episode where the chick has a thirty second exchange with Moth Gideon, and in another scene he mentions to the other baddies how the scientist guy died... So WE COULD HAVE SKIPPED THAT ENTIRE EPISODE, seriously. It wasn't even remotely relevant, it didn't do anything at all, and all we needed was those few lines in the penultimate episode and there'd be no difference to The Mandalorian's main plot, seriously. So ye, I enjoyed it, but it really, reeeeally didn't belong here...
That intern gag was SO cleverly done. I was grinning from ear to ear like a complete idiot for a minute or so.😅
LOL. The cream quest... great stuff.   Funny that Disney is disappointed in the viewership, despite doing everything in their power to reduce it.   Maybe doing a backdoor season of Mando in a totally different show—just to persuade fans of the former to watch the latter—wasn't such a hot good idea. But idk.
Me during intern thing: "... ... ... WTF is going on? Ryan, what are you doing? This is completely irrelevant to The Mandalorian and makes no sense! ... OOOOH, I get it now!" 😂😂😂
@starwarstheory needs to watch this
5:02 I love how Producer Guy's "Oh, really?" was so insincere this time. He knows that Mando always has a literal plot armor so he'll be fine.
Creating a Pitch Meeting that gets more views of the actual show is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
im ngl, I had no idea season 3 was even fucking out until this pitch meeting.
This is one of your very best Ryan. The intern sub plot was so spot on! I liked that whole section as it felt like it was opening up things to a different perspective then that was it other than a couple of pointless very brief scenes with the spy. Such a messy season!
Side quest intern still has better writing than Radiant story quests in Skyrim.
I love this channel:)
These improve ending sounds like Biden's official speeches XD
Season 3 was pure crap, a bitter disappointment....
This was the most incredible in a very long line of incredible Pitch Meeting episodes. My hat is off to you.
There really needs to be a Super-like button or something on this site. Liking masterpieces like this only once is just not enough
Mando goes to the supermarket. Mando goes to the dry cleaners. Mando at the jiffy lube. Mando at the furniture store. Mando eats a hot dog with fries. Mando.............
My favorite video game is rogue squadron and it's nothing but missions  Missions good. Monsters good. Space battles good. Flying jetpack battles good.
The internet was both the best and worst idea, because now we're invested - he must return!! Lol
You perfectly capture how poorly conceived and written modern “entertainment “ is.
Ryan is a genius
Man, there are some sexy men working for this production company.
This is the way to pitch
Celebrity cameos we can milk for publicity is tight.
Could you do a pitch meeting for “Puss in boots The Last Wish” pleaseeee it’d be perfectttt
Oh damn the Pitch lore is thickening
I demand that intern gets his own spinoff.
Still have this feeling that Ryan is kinda sorta finished with the big producer guy being all over his back about making these every week! On account of him not really wanting to script his outro… ;) Why don’t you get all the way off Ryan’s back now?! He’s got us hook line and sinker’d with the Pitch meetings… we will always be watching them no matter how far between they are!
I liked the bit when Mando blew up Moff Gideon's force kin, with just one finger. That was tight!
Omg that side story was perfect. Made me laugh so hard. Perfection
End things are tight.🤗
I don’t know, if you have Disney plus is it really that hard to keep up with everything
I've enjoyed most of your shows, but never laughed so much as with the intern side quest!.. lol
That intern has a very nice car
okay but like a genuinely good representation of the empire and how colonisers steal resources and pass them off as their own
Mando is dead
Can you do a pitch meeting for the movie Pontypool?
Ryan, do you think you can do a pitch meeting for the tv show The Mentalist? There is so much to tear apart in that show. It is 6 and half seasons long. That's a problem. But, i think it deserves critical analysis.
Best. Episode. Ever!
New spinoff series coming... The intern
You know  That's an exchange I didn't consider. If people weren't watching both Mandalorian and The Book Of Boba Fett. They would be totally confused about Grogu being back with Dinn Jarin in the opening of Mandalorian season three. A Disney Woop-sie!
Disappointed that Ryan couldn't get any product placement for the car ad.....
IM OK WITH SIDESTORIES!
Evil dead rise pitch meeting next
Will we see the pitch guy in the new season of "Intern, the battle of the supply closet"?  Staring in episode 5: (asking chatGPT "give me 3 random celebrities"):  Jennifer Lawrence - an American actress known for her roles in movies like "The Hunger Games" and "Silver Linings Playbook". Lionel Messi - an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Paris Saint-Germain and the Argentina national team. Lizzo - an American singer and rapper known for her hit songs "Truth Hurts" and "Good as Hell".  Whaattttt?? Getting a random Lizzo is tight!!!
Disney became worse than CW.
Genius
Are the Mandalores related to the Mangalores from The Fifth Element??
Finally an episode that expands on the pitch meeting universe!
The side quest was epic
I'm off to watch a pitch meeting that was released 40 years ago , relive my childhood before there were countless other pitchmeetings which diluted the originals. 40th anniversary's are tight. 😉
2:51 had me 😂 spot on pretentious over acting 😍 (never seen the show btw)
I gotta ask- when does Pitch Meering Guy get accused of being Alt-Right? Like all those supposedly "Alt-Right" people do basically the same videos?
One of the best video outro's ever.
Best episode yet again
How did you manage to do a summary of Mando s3 with virtually no mention of Bo-Katan?
"Never gonna se him again"  WHY???? I want to see him again :(´  I´ll stop hitting like, until I see him again ;P
Episodes about getting cream thingies are tight
Ryan is now my third favorite Canadian Ryan
good day sir Ryan George, i hope this comment finds you well, may i suggest that you pitch a meeting on the "kungfu panda" seiries
This wasn't a deconstruction, this was a roast
Great, now I have to watch Guy Selling Sandwiches With A Sorta Medium Sized Pickle to see the ending of Intern and Store Guy's story.
It would be more appropriate if the intern just didn't return.
Good stuff, appreciate the recap because I stopped watching after 3 episodes of this season.
Brilliant!
The intern side quest was perfect.
Now we need the intern guy spinoff where he made it as a producer of a video game company.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
OMFG THAT THUMBNAIL IS HAUNTED!
Righto, dude. Don't fall too far down the meta rabbit-hole.
It is sad to not see intern guy again. Would have made a good spin off 😂😂😂
yea uh....this mando season is pretty awful 😂
Great pitch meeting!
When you want to actually make a girl power show but know it will tank, what are your options? Destroy a hugely successful show and hope no one will notice.
Watching the side story of the intern, Guy Ryan, is super easy and barely an inconvenience.
❤😂❤😂❤😂
The way's tight.
The Intern: A Story of Turd and Cream
i hated the twist ending where you find out that grogu was an alien the entire time
The Intern even has his own funky flute tunes for his quests! 😂 2:30
WORLD BUILDING 😂
I love it... especially Intern Guys side quest, can't wait for him to get his own series that gets taken over halfway through by Producer Guy.  You did miss the perfect opportunity with the Moff Gideon/Stormtrooper part to throw in a "They fly now"
I'm glad I dont watch this crap anymore...Star Wars, I mean 😅 Could never get enough if Ryan's content 😁👌
The fact I have to keep up with ALL the shows to know what’s going on just made me lose interest in whatever Disney’s making these days.
I see what you did there with the intern, it was perfect 😂
I feel like they pulled an episode 9 where they just said, "screw everything we've been building up this whole time, we're doing something entirely unrelated now!"  It would have been better if they saved the final battle with Moff Gideon for next season and just teased his force clones this season, or just skipped the filler and got straight to the plot (not that I'm complaining about Jack Black in Star Wars).
I find it funny how much crap the fanz of Star Warz are more than willing to consume..
I’ve seen both The Mandalorian and Book of Bobs Fett. I will rewatch a series before starting a new season. So at the start of Season 3, I had just finished watching seasons 1 and 2 and when Groru pops up in the ship’s dome even I’m like? Wait? Where did he come from? Ok. They’ll explain later in the episode because this is just a teaser shot. They didn’t. I thought I was losing my mind and rewatched the end of the last episode of season 2 that I had already seen to see if I missed Grogu coming back until I remembered it was the Book of Boba Fett where he comes back.
Can you make a whole series about the intern guy, I just wanna watch hours of videos of this guy doing mundane tasks filled with some side quests in his way full of stock footage.
Tuur 65 be asking par eyn arcane pitch meeting
I wanna see more of Intern Guy.
I was more invested in the intern story than the rest of this episode - mostly because of the music.  The actor playing Producer-guy really needs to up his game to get to the same level as Intern-guy.
These pitch meetings have better scripts than the shows they're mocking.
A lot of series these days, does the stretch out and rush plot at the end thingy. 🙄
I completely agree with the ending scene. I was fully expecting him to remove his helmet, fully cementing that Grogu is his family so its allowed in the creed. Kinda annoyed he didnt 😂
If there is two interns who both work for producer guys, I wonder how many other producer guys there are and what they are producing.
That drive was amazing
I love how this feels like a late-night table-top RPG session with a group of 20-something year-old friends who are coming together to tell a flawed, cliched story together made from pop culture references and stupid jokes. This Pitch Meeting had that feeling, too.  *Or, for the younger gen, I suppose it feels like endless NPC sidequests in an RPG videogame. Where's Greg the garlic farmer?
Holy shit! The side quest was brilliant!
Side Quests are tight!!
Why😂😂😂!!!
"He's working on this really cool show where he's a loner looking after a kid " "That's this show!?"
The pitch meeting was way more entertaining than the entirety of the show itself!!
I don't mind Mando "taking a back seat." He'd pretty much got what he wanted by Episode 4, and he was never as invested in the wider Mandalore drama as Bo-Katan was.  Hopefully now that that's all wrapped up, Season 4 will have more Din & Grogu adventures (especially with where we left them).
I can’t wait for the Intern to the Producer Guy’s spin-off show. I most definitely need to see him again. How did he become an intern to the Producer Guy? What does he and the other interns talk about? Where does he go after work? Will he ever become a Producer Guy and have his own pitch meetings with his own intern? What is the Intern to the Once an Intern to the Producer Guy like? How did Pitch Guy get started? Does he have an intern?
Side quests and side character-focused episodes were fine when shows had 20+ episode seasons. You would think an eight episode season would allow the writers to focus on what was important in telling a compelling story.
I love how in some pitch meetings when a show or film is really badly written you can actually see how pissed off it makes Ryan
For a second I thought I'd accidently skipped to anothrt video when the intern thing popped up then I realised where it was going. Absolute genius. 😂
You have outdone yourself my friend. Bravo
Absolutely fucking gold. You continue to keep this fresh. Side quest is genuis.
Christopher Lloyd - Dalorian  great Scot
lizzo needs to go why is she on things?she should be a hut or a rancor
Disney just can't stop dropping the ball.
That side quest had me howling with laughter, so appropriate.
the way he explined the issues with the side quest is amazing...
Once again, you've raised the bar.
I found myself saying, why is Ryan having this weird intern go to the store thi…..oh, i get it
This pitch meeting was better than the season 3
And that's how folks, Ryan became a Mandalorian cream hunter from a young foundling.
that aerial shot of the crossing, you can clearly see the hand of director guy...shivers
Before Season 3 I rewatched the Mandalorian... and when the new season started I thought: Wait.. this is not how the old season ended. The book of Boba Fett is Season 2.5 of the Mandalorian. As Ashoka will maybe become season 3.5.
First time clicking the like button before the video ended😂😅😅
Love how Ryan takes such a simple concept yet turns it into a creative and layered video!! Keep up the creativity Ryan. Also can you do a pitch meeting for Grease
Meilleur moment de ma semaine, merci Ryan.
Wait, which Ryan George was this?
Stunning that these get better every year.
How could they mess up a show as good as the Mandalorian? Like for real I’m almost impressed.
The cream side quest of the intern was actually better than the full season of Mandolorian!
Star wars fans who watched the mandalorian, but didn't watch book of boba fett is like saying they watched all of game of thrones but skipped season 6. SMH.
Disney has killed Star Wars and marvel….. thank you for this video. It’s a public service announcement 😆
Amazing work Ryan i love that the episodes now evolve into something bigger!!!!! My respects!!!!
this was better than The Mandalorian season 3
interns have a very specific skill set
Ooh, picking celebrity names out of a bag is tight!
Last thing I watched that Disney released was endgame….. I hope I can stay vigilant enough that I die that way
Brilliant !!
Ok so you referenced it here...  WHERE'S THE LAST OF US PITCH MEETING?!
The funniest part of the side quest was seeing him plunge the toilet lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂
So, Disney just absolutely massacred the meaning of Star Wars, didn’t they.
I will say, I actually enjoyed the side story episode with the former imperials. It fleshed out aspects of the new government and set up the idea that former imperials could be spies, shaping the New Republic from the inside.   I will say however, if you're going to spend a full episode setting up a new villain and plot thread, maaaayyybe give it some form of payoff within that season. It'd be nice to not have to wait til season 4 to see how that imperial lady will be a major threat and how her arc will end cuz so far all we've seen is her get one scientist killed and report back to the higher ups like once, that can't be the whole story they had planned for that character right?
this one felt personal, good work
Wait when did this happen?
and yet ... some how ... the car ride was very relaxing.  Thank you :
Mandalorian Season 3 was kind of a let down to be honest. Plot points where stretched needlessly, went in all directions, the main story struggled forward at a snail's pace, characters just change their whole ideals and mentality overnight, ...  It would've been more fitting to call it Bo-Katan Season 1, or just "Tales of the Galaxy". Which to be honest would be a great idea for a TV show, each Season a collection of small contained stories taking place all around the Galaxy, each impacted in a different way by the current Events, etc...
Ryan Cinematic Universe
Goofy ahh show
The absolute best one ever. This is the way.
Bwaa ha ha 😂
I liked season 3 🥺
Loved the side quest. Pretty much sums up the structure of the show. What was once the proud flagship of Disney+ has turned into a side show attraction with randomly inserted celebrity cameos. Pity.
Watching people over invest in a series then becoming upset when it goes stale is tight
Why aren't we asking how the coffee-running intern has THAT car
I feel like it's really telling that I went into this video not even sure if I watched season 3. And it took until after the intern gag to figure out I hadn't. And then I didn't care enough to avoid spoilers
I was wondering why or how this was 7 minutes long. Too long for a pitch meeting.  Then he pulled a solid 2 minutes of that last jedi shit. Apparently that's a running gag in sw now.  Glad to see this and yt comments for making me aware of the travesty that is gugu. Hate that lil shit. Would have stabbed someone 😂if I actually watched s3 e1 and it was back.
Ryan is a genius
Epic PM, Ryan. Many LOL moments in this video -- totally worth another look (wish I could like it twice!) And thanks for doing the entire season in one video rather than breaking it up. It took me a bit to realize the whole intern thing was just a different way to describe this season of The Mandalorian, and based on the few episodes I've seen from previous seasons I think you nailed it.
"bad guys love somehow returning" lol i hope people never let them live that line down.   but i enjoyed this season. i think most people issues is they just want the pew pew with out all the pesky character and world building.
Anyone notice the episode with Jack Black was "Logan's Run".
I like my sugar with coffee and cream. You can have anything in this world. Except C.R.E.A.M.
I expected the "Tight" part to come later, at the "stretching things out"...
my daughter is requesting you please do a Pitch Meeting for the Netflix series, "A Series of Unfortunate Events".
This "show" has an 8,7/10 rating. What is wrong with the majority of people?
All jokes aside, the moment Grogu got between the 2 Mandalorians that were fighting made me cry, seeing what would be a defenseless child gain the ability to not only stand between 2 adults hurting each other, but having the voice to be heard when he said "No" idk but something about that felt so powerful to me
Good thing I watched this season before watching this Pitch Meeting!
You should post a sequel to this video on your own channel then post a prequel to this video on screen rant
can we get an intern bros spin off where major plot points for the pitch meeting series happen and they're never explained ever again
That was amazing... and depressingly true.
I need a Star Trek Picard skit bad!
I still really want to see an Andor pitch meeting. It'd be funny to see producer guy wrapping his head around making actually good product
I was happily watching this until I noticed I haven’t seen one or two episodes so I spoiled the Moff Gideon clone thing for myself🫤
Give Intern Guy his own series NOW Pitch Meeting
Ryan has transcended to a new level of comedy genius. He is the master of Meta with the ability to produce comedy and parody while not sacrificing storytelling. This is truly epic and amazing
Can you imagine how much he dislikes the mandalorian în order for him to break the format?
I quite liked the "new republic" people doing their stuff. Was it overdone? Sure. But on the other hand it also shows why they fell so quickly to the first order which I also think is needed for people who haven't/aren't going to read the first order book. Great video as always
Disney and Favreau will like to talk to you, sir 😂 throwing that magical writing formula here for free HOW DARE YOU ❤
2:00 this fuckin gag is gold, and I want more of it.
Almost as good as a cat video!!
Disney love sidelining main characters in their own show. (Hawkeye, dr  strange)
I was hoping you'd say "So stuff is just kinda happening...?" in this one, 'cause that's exactly how I felt during most of this season.
I actually liked the side story with the doctor.
That side story was directed by Vince Gilligan.
Brilliant and poignant
Yeah this season wasn't super great but it was then thousand times better season two
~sucks in through teeth~ aaaaaaahhhhhhh. ya know i get it... and it took me watching EXACTLY THIS to realize it... good thing i watched both for free! doot doodle oot doot, doot doot
“And so Mando and Grogu are gonna stumble across a room full of Moff Gideon clones and they destroy them all by using a button that destroys them all.”  “Why would Moff Gideon have that installed?”  “Unclear.”  *I lost it* 💀💀
I don't regret never starting Mandalorian.
Field trip!
Hold up! CREAM isn't THAT hard to find!
RIP Intern guy.
More world development in Ryan’s world then the Mandolorian had
At least your sidequest was connected directly to the main storyline. We always knew what's going on.
This was the best pitch meeting I've watched in a while, and I've been watching everyone for years ❤ the intern gag, plus pulling names out of a hat. Genius 😂😂
Disney forgets that word of mouth is a thing, if your show is good and someone watches it then tells there friend to watch it, its going to spread a lot faster then if your show sucks then someone watches it then tells there friends not to watch it. they seam to think they can make whatever corporate lifeless hollow crap they want and get away with it.     to be fair they are doing that with the Disney remakes and its working for them so maybe its our fault for giving them so much money for making terrible shows.
I LOVE MANDOLOREAN AND GROGU ... YEAH! GREAT SHOW, SHOW IS INTERESTING .. YEAH!
Your roast with the sidequest, towards the beginning/middle, was just brilliant -had me crackin' up 👌😄💯.  Thanks as always for making us laugh, internet friend.  Also, I love how 2 of the 3 cameos have to be morbidly obese people.  The meek and the worthless will never successfully inherit the earth and extinct us all if we don't constantly put forward their worst traits as admirable in media! 🙄😮‍💨
Oh yeah! Clogged toilets are tight!
Me: “wait, why are we on this random side quest with some intern trying to get cream? I thought we were talking about the Mandalorian season 3 and how inconsistent- ohhhhhhh…”
This is the only good thing to come from Mandalorian Season 3
mando s3 was just so low iq
Still waiting on john wick chapter 4 pitch meeting
That was practically cathartic. At least something good came out of this season.
So… Your side story was actually good compared to The Mandalorian’s.
You knocked it out the park with this one - great job.
I think the biggest let down for me with this season was the inconsistency. The ending itself was decent and definitely wholesome, but I just wish the actual season had been more enjoyable. The plot was all over the place and it felt like we left off things that were supposed to be important such as IG-11, the Mythosaur, and the Darksaber. Instead we were having dinner parties with Jack Black! Din and Grogu also being sidelined for Bo-Katan pissed me off as well because Bo-Katan is supposed to get her own show later, yet it felt like she took the spotlight in season 3 of Mando’s show. I really believe there was a lot of potential this season, but instead the first 6 episodes just felt like a massive waste of time. Definitely a disappointing season overall which is honestly depressing because the show itself really is good.
Can’t wait for Greef Karga and IG-11 to have their own episode in “Ahsoka.” 😂
that sidequest was better than the main thing!
It would be incredibly hard to make people completely disinterested in star wars Actually it's gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience
I love when a pitch meeting and Ryan's other sketches kinda merge and produce a pitch meeting/ryan george sketch. I mean yes they're all Ryan's sketches etc but I'm talking about introducing other characters. If you're not already famiiliar with Ryan's own channel, binge it and you'll know what I mean.
I watched 3 minutes of the first episode and then dropped it and from the looks of it, it was 100% the right decision. Give me quality writing like in Andor!
At first I thought the side quest was a parody of the recent pitch meeting which was disrupted by an advertisement.
Is it bad that I actually hope we DO see the intern again. So many potential shenanigans with him and his co-worker!
New characters
I'm actually really invested in this Intern Guy storyline so if we could get like a whole spinoff show for him that'd be TIGHT.
Would be more accurate to Disney Star Wars if Producer Guy was pitching the story to Writer Guy 😂
This was the funniest and most accurate review of the season
The interns tho~ and - DA WEI. ⛩️🏯🏪🐄🥛
In my head cannon the other intern works for the writer guy.
NOT GONNA LIE i skipped through that whole side story about the guy from the first season and it literally didnt matter at all, like it had no impact on my grasping the story, pitch meeting was the first to make fun of the side quests aspects of this show and ryan was right
Best pitch meeting yet.  Never laughed at a driving car this much.  You've outdone yourself
😂😂😂😂
The Mandalorian could have taken his helmet off at the end and there could've been a cow's head underneath and no one would have been able to tell the difference.
Adding a pointless,unconnected random side-quest into a show talking about the pointlessness of unconnected random side-quests is tight!
The intern gag would have been really something for number 300 😂
i feel like that side quest has more production than any other pitch meeting
They should learn from BBC. For a show like this, tell a story for a season, conclude the story, and then move on to something new.
That show is still running?
God damn, Canada is biiiiig...
They run out of fuel for their jetpacks chasing the flying monster a few tens of kilometers, but they have enough fuel in the same jetpacks to fly to orbit on Madalore.....hmm...
Now do puss in boots TLW
This is now my favorite Pitch Meeting of all time with that zide story  😂🤣💀
Well it works for Disney😂🤣😂 good work Ryan💚🇬🇧🌱
Ryan: "...and that's how you do a perfect Pitch Meeting. Class dismissed!"
The side quest was tight!!
Maybe it's just me but tbh i was more interested in the side quest adventures of Dr Coward and Double Agent Lady that the main plot. It reminded me of the much better Star Wars show Andor. A show were a handful of not even stormtroopers but army troopers felt more of a threat than a whole legion of "beskar jump troopers", a show where a man slowly, silently realizing his life was a lie had me more on the edge of my seat than anything this season. It's a real problem Andor was so damn good it single-handedly revived my interest in Star Wars. But it was so damn good that shows like S3 Mandolorian which are...fine, seem bad in comparison.
Why is the video so long?... Ah...
It takes an intellectual to realize The Mandalorian was never really good. Even season 1 and especially season 2 suffer from some hideously long filler and underdeveloped characters.
This is hysterical 😂
Side Quests to get cream is tight.
At 2:21 you can see people on screen who are not Ryan George, talk about a plothole! Boy I sure hope somebody got fired for THAT blunder.
GOAT!!🤣
I will seriously tune in to this cinematic universe that y’all are building.
Danger, SW Fan-children can be self-loathing, illogical knit-tweets and may be narky about your views.
This might just be your Masterpiece.
What? No mention of The Ladies Man?
"Star Wars bad guys love somehow returning," just casually slipped in there.
I got Disney trolled by Ryan but Im not complaining
Every Star Wars and Disney related Pitch Meetings feels absolutely on point. And real, when considering the quality Disneys been putting up the past 5-10 years.
That random episode with Jack Black caught me... then they go in another room and i see Doc Brown sitting behing a computer talking scifi mumbo jumbo and thought, "yeah, this all checks out."
Mando Season 3 pitch meeting: bo katan is boss babe independent woman thats better at everything than anyone else because of reasons.  Disney: yassssss queen, slayyyyyyy. The force is female, yassssss
Well... now I want a 8 episode series of intern guy doing side quest.
This is brilliant, comedy gold
you outdone yourself!
Please do Alita Battle Angel 🙏
No words can express how brilliant this was! Excellent stuff 😂😊
I've been complaining about this crap since season one where there is that whole episode with the Jawas (I bet you didn't even remember that did ya). The main plot points of the show are pretty solid but if Disney can't learn to deliver on what they promise without the unnecessary bullsh*t then this show is going to deservedly die. The fact is that episodes 7 and 8 should have been 3 and 4. At this point, I couldn't care less about this show, it has glimpses of greatness, but when Andor exists I just won't be getting excited about the Mandalorian any more.
Am I the only one who didn’t know there was a season 3 until I saw the pitch meeting
this pitch meetingf was better then the entire season 3
The best pitch meeting ever!!!!!
Somehow Moff Gideon returned!! ❤️
pitch meeting > Mandalorian
Funk this was great, I don't know how but you step up your game every time
😂😂😂
The saga of Intern Guy was beautiful and epic and I REALLY really hope we get more shows and movies that become distracted with side stories to the detriment of the main story so that he can return in future episodes!
NEVER SCRIPT THE END THINGS. 😁👍👍
That coffee bit was  HUGE diss on Disney. Take the L disney, you got dunked on.
So... if a main character can go on a side quest in a different show, then logically if follows that somewhere out there is a video series about Intern Guy and Other Intern Guy.  I'm definitely going to subscribe to that.
I can't wait for Producer Guy to show up on Ryan's personal channel to finish his story arc in the next "First Guy to..." video.
Took me on a journey side character. I am all in on Assistant Meeting.
Your humor is unmatched and never gets old!
Yet another steaming turd from Disney
Intern sidequest is way more interesting than this entire damn season
Fun fact: you actually need good writers to make a good show. Crazy.
Perfect representation of Disney Star Wars.
I already miss the intern
Ow side quests are tight
WTF
Everyone complaining about the branch stories, when Dave Filoni has everything planned out.
This was an adventure and lesson rolled into one. You had me in stitches!
I blame all of the small derailment of the season on Kathleen Kennedy. Everything she touches always ends up terrible. Remove her entirely from starwars
So good :D
@2:40 *me*  "Subverting expectations is tight"
Some valid points, but Mando has always been like this. I do think it's always been too slow overall but this season we finally get plot and development about the mandalorian people
But the B plot side characters Science guy and Empire Lady story in episode 3 was actually legit better written and more interesting character wise than the main plot.
this side quest has me grinning ear to ear. this is perfect.
Well said
When you cut to the car 💀
I stopped watching at like episode 4 and I couldn't put my finger on why I did but I think you nailed it here, the show was better when it was episodic lol
Holy crap I just witnessed the birth of a new universe
HA! Pitch meeting for the ROFL award yet again. Yeah, I have Star Wars tats and I have pretty much given up on Disney not mangling the franchise. I went from two weeks off the internet in 2015 to avoid spoilers for TFA to "meh, don't really care" in a pretty short time. Oh, spoiler alert TFA turned out to be ANH, only not good.
Ryan ur the goat bruh 😂😂
HAHAHA
We did need more baths, there weren't enough in Book of Boba Fett 🤦‍♂️
This is a W pitch meeting haha
Great Pitch Meeting Ryan
Lmao I love the side quest
Self demonstrating criticism is an art form.
Can we  see Assist guy again
Mario become cashier
QUESTIONS for the next REVISITED Episode - (1st, I looove your sense of humor! Smart, absurd and caustic altogether!) Q1 - How did you set the lighting to match the one in your background image so well?  Q2 - What are the reasons behind those falling fake mustaches? Thank you for making me laugh!
Your writing is so much better than The Mandalorian 😄. It really is such a bad show. The intern side quest was better and made more sense than anything in the actual show. I enjoy watching Pitch Meetings far more than any of the actual shows or movies. Thank you!
I kinda hate that I love and am invested in the Interns side plot/distraction more so than ANY side plot/distraction that Disney has shat out..
Okay, hats down the best pitch meeting so far. I laughed so hard! Love it
Can we have more side quests from the intern 😂😂. Can he be reoccurring for shows/ movies that does unnecessary side quests??
I was waiting and waiting for the helmet to come off in that last scene of the season... At least now I know why it didn’t. You’d think they could’ve at least made a weird CGI head.
Somehow I always return to watch Ryan's skits. It's super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Saw this and was just like, “oh boy, this should be good!” And as always, it was so so worth it!! Great job as always 😊
All his skits are hilarious, but this is one is f-ing brilliant. This guy is a genius.
So obviously we need a spin off channel dedicated to just the Intern…
Dude the SUV with the dust behind it while wind instrument traveling music plays killed me
Oh my God the casting has been expanded and big budget for this one!¡
Can we not just enjoy some monster of the week/random adventures?
Hilarious and very accurate
We're MARVEL. We do what our Mouse Overlord do.  It's super easy; barely an inconvenience.
intern guy should have his own series
intern guy should have his own series
This season was super good. Probably the best season yet. I'd be totally fine if they phased Mando out and focused on other mandalorians like Sabine and Bo-Katan.
That’s all Disney does now. Take the main character and have them be drug around by a box checking character.
After season 2, this show became hot garbage
This season was atrocious - they are more compelling sesame street seasons that had better writing.
Honestly I never want the helmet to come off. Masked characters are better when they stay masked
The thing about Star Wars is, you are expected to watch every show or kids cartoon they put out or things don't make sense. I see Darth Maul get cut in half and then he just pops up like he didn't get cut in half. All because there was some kid's show on back when I didn't have cable.
Dude, you're the best. Always funny.
Thanks Ryan
Fun mix up!
hilarious! lmao
Oh jesus, this is ingenious. Took me like good 10+secs to understand the coffee skit.  I get the criticism Mando S3 gets and it's not like it's wrong or false. It's just that ... I still enjoyed the show. Seems like there are is a huge group of people that thinks it's the worst thing on tv ever and I find that a bit odd. But to each his own or sth like that.
I am invested in Intern's journey. Give him his own show!
I liked this pitch meeting by Ryan George
Now we need a feature length movie about how the Assistant guy got his car
The internet is never happy. If Mando episodes are not moving the plot forward, people screech about fillers or side quests. If it's all plot, people complain there isn't enough world building.  Also, Gideon sent those elite troopers to guard his clones with forcefields. He didn't know Mando had an astromech infiltrate the base. But then, if he said as much, people would complain "UGH SHOW DON'T TELL".   The internet was a mistake.
This was the best pitch meeting skit yet. The way you exposed the poor writing of S3 in a humorous way shows how incredible of a writer you are.  Keep it up dude
Thank you for explaining why they started the series together. I had no idea
Considering the way Disney blow up beloved franchises, they make the Empire look like the Salvation Army.
Way to drive home the point.
Wow we actually went outside
Just saw S6 of Better Call Saul, and I was disappointed when Lalo let Gus Fring monologue. So nonsensical, telegraphed, and lame.
The Lizzo the Hutt episode was for sure the Jump the Shark episode of this series.

I liked the side quest storytelling... just giving me more of the lore of a galaxy post-Empire.
OK, NOW I´m really laughing, hahahahahahahhaha
We got side quests now I see production is on next level
im so adhd i didnt realize till halfway in that the assistant thing was a bit
Man this snow became completely dogshit and ryan sums it up perfectly 😂😂😂😂😂
Fun fact: Both of those interns are named Pollux; if you need them, just call, "Pollux," because both of them are named Pollux... their names are Pollux.
Good. Pascal is a chump.
This pitch meeting was unnecessarily epic. Idk how you think of this!
Man, intern guy had me thinking l was watching a car commercial during the off road shots.  Well played sir.
The cream.... You must get the cream.... Then, only then, a good intern will you be... And get it you will.
Wait... Pedro Pascal wasn't on set this whole time?!!! 😳
Amazing literary 👏 👏 .
The wows are back!
alg
All I have to say is, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches, peaches
Never saw that intern thing coming😂
Wow. He really comes up STILL ! With original content. Really well done Ryan George
Side quest was amazing. But it made me realize how sad Disney (and star wars) is now. They used to tell stories that said something about life. Now it just feels like they're running down the clock.
That intern plot was such a genius idea! Took me a while to realize what was going on, but when I did, I almost cried laughing
Well now you have to give the intern his own spin-off show in 6 months....
Bonus points for mirroring the "driving there" footage to make the "driving back" footage "
So many Ryan Georges driving on the city road. No wonder the side quest for creamer took so long, traffic is just terrible sometimes.
It was a car commercial the whole time.
just no squeezie.
Ya...I stopped watching at the end of Bobo fette .... Along with deleting my Disney+ aswell 👍
I really enjoyed this season.
it's kinda crazy that you can manage to make this series hilarious hundreds of episodes in, while a show with like 1000x your budget cant manage to keep us interested past 25 episodes.
In true Disney fashion I think we need a spin off show about intern guy
In the top 10 best pitch meetings ever, easy
man you missed a glowing popsicle joke there
Not a single JarJar reference?
Umm did we get TMI with the store’s toilet?
Apparently, life imitates art.
Ironicly I think that was in the top 3 of your funniest and best video!! Damn it what you were laughing at turned out to work on us!
Dude you actually did a B plot inside this pitch meeting that is better than the series it refers to LMAO and that's saying a lot, it's actually a good show
In a way, i do respect Disney's "if you dont watch everything we put out, thats YOUR problem"
I didn't even watch any season of mandalorian or boba Fett or Wanda vision. So like I'm not sure
Awww...Ryan George is growing up. Veering away from the formula, refusing to script endings with a sullen look. He's practically a teenager.
fake moustache on moustache gets me every time...
Day 9 of asking to do a pitch meeting of One Piece Red film
this episode of pitch meeting is a masterpiece man hahaha, the shittier the season the better the pitch meeting.
Protagonick has been busy
Gideon's clone tanks were obviously constructed by Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz Industries, Inc. 😂
Half expected the quest for cream to take him to a shop in wakanda
That intern guy has what it takes!
Love the content, tho these days it seems the shows are making it almost too easy, still doing all of that solo must be tough
You see you need to understand we needed to follow intern so we can see how he gets producer guys coffee
The production value of this show has really gone through the roof. I can't believe he had helicopter footage of that travel from one point to the other.
Hands down, one of my absolute favorite Pitch Meetings. The side quest and the random celebrity names cracked me up. Keep up the good work, Ryan!
How far is the store?😭🤣
Embarrassed to say I was confused why we were following the intern guy then I finally got it.
"Okay, I'll tell you what... No" made me choke on my lunch
The trip to the store to get cream was more intriguing than MandoLizzo.
During that one episode? I said, aloud, at least three times, "Oh okay. We're still watching this guy." The "payoff" was NOT worth it
Can we have a "Return of the Intern" episode? That guy was a breath of fresh air, with his good looks, charisma and charm, which is lacking in the Producer Guy, in particular. Thanks in advance,
Worst part of Mando S3 having low viewer numbers is that Disney will take that as a reason to cancel Mando, not put people that care about the IP in charge to make it better as any capable company would. But this is Disney, the only thing modern disney is capable of is buying IP's writtem by far superior creatives and ruin it due to their greed.
I really thought the barely an inconvenience moment was going to be when Bo-Katan had to unite the clans and Mando just hands her the dark saber.
yeah what the uck was the point of that Pershing episode
Disney sure knows how to stretch uninteresting moments.
Love the little touch of showing the intern’s car going back n forth, rlly emphasises how drawn out these scripts rlly are.
I screamed laughing at the end of that side quest hahahahhaha
Yeah I didn’t care for that one episode
Best pitch meeting yet.
So.... when is the next season of Intern Guy?
Why in the side quest is the b roll of some Japanese rural road?
I watch shows for free and still didn't watch Mandalorian S3
The side story was so good, that if anything, this gag made me appreciate more the side stories in Mando.
Undeserved hate for the show imo.  It wasn’t as good as  seasons 1 & 2 but it is miles better than the sequels - which Disney is known for of course  Edit: it was actually decent 7.5/10  For reference:  Rogue One 9/10  Solo: 6/10  Sequels: 2/10
- If Disney doesn't give the intern his own spinoff… 😒 - (Um, I thought the Book of Boba Fett was season two of Mandalorian? 🤔) - Wait, so I _shouldn't_ have installed a self-destruct button in my home? I guess I should remove it. But I'm not going to. 🤷
Wait, there was viewership of season three? Who was it that watched?
Brilliant!
I know the nagging point was STOP doing all these b storylines from taking over the main story, but this kinda worked.
Intern side quest freakin hilarious
These interns are gonna be in for hell...
This is spot on
Epic side-quest!
Somehow, the intern returned.
Screenwriter guy stole that idea from Intern!
This was much better than season 3 of lame-alorian
Best pitch meeting ever
Starts off as gunsmoke in space through the first two seasons and the third season is the muppet show.
This Pitch Meeting solidifies that Ryan is the funniest creator on YT.  Bravo.
You know…I’d like more adventures with the intern. Get some Yakuza like side stories.
That and fire all the great characters for no reason.
The intern quest has to be the best gag in Pitch Meeting history
I love you
Genius. Brilliant.
Congratulations, this is a great episode.
Yup pretty much summed it up. A bunch of nothing for ages, then a bunch of something real fast, then OK all done now, b'bye...
Best pitch meeting in a while
Ohhh, the interns where taking up screentime from the writer and producer. Okay, now I have to watch it all over again.☺️👍
Please do a pitch meeting for the 2017 and 2021 My Little Pony movies and oddballs
I now need Producer Guy intern's entire backstory!! Keep up the awesome content Ryan!!
Man, that turned into an SUV commercial for a minute there didn't it?😄
Oh man, I forgot to grab cream at the store.
Side quests are tight.
I expected Lizzo and Jack Black being just a joke made up for the pitch meeting. I was wrong.
One thing you didn’t picked upon is the death of Paz Visla. He fight all the guys wearing jetpacks and guns and kills them all, and when the red guards shows up (without guns, nor jetpack) he decided to pull a knife and fight, instead of just say see ya suckers, and fly away. As a mandolorian, it is pretty bad not to think about using your jetpack.
No more Mando, no more show. Fck bo katan.
10/10 Genius
“We’re Disney. Watch everything we make or else” is practically their slogan at this point
5:16 kinda a miss opportunity to compare villain from Avatar 2 and this cloning process
This is gold
Last time I give Disney's Star Wars another shot. Legends is the only Canon for me.
I've watched a lot of these over the years... I gotta say, my man fully outdid himself with this one. The subtlety of the jabs, and the way he so poignantly highlighted the sheer stupidity of what this show has become can't be understated. It's like the one tiny reprieve we all get from watching our favorite things get murdered by woke douchebags. Thanks Ryan. You're a gem buddy.
innovative and funny!
Right up there with Season 8 of GoT
You know what, honestly Disney should stop giving their series' titles, instead of The Mandalorian, Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, they should be accurate and just call them "The Star Wars show" then it won't matter who the main character is!
I don't really watch disney, but watching disney fuck everything up for the past 8 years is pretty amusing
This is why we can't have nice things. When writers go of "formula" the programmed on formula people loos their minds.
You made your point. That was brutal!!!
I HATE DISNEY PLUS SERIES THAT'S PLOTS ARE STRETCHED OUT OVER AN UNNECESSARY AMOUNT OF EPISODES, JUST STOP.
As always...very on point. The producer side being so absolutely arrogant that people won't give up on Star Wars if you upset them enough was excellent.
This one made me actually laugh out loud!
We request the 4-hour director's cut of that epic journey.
Looking back its actually going to be insanely confusing for people in the future who only watch The Mandalorian Seasons 1 2 3 and not those two episodes of Book of Boba Fett, wonder why Grogu is back with Mando again and when did all his Jedi/Force training with Luke Skywalker happen??
Top tier satire
I must say; I am very much looking forward to the further adventures of Intern Guy!
Wow, he did not pull punches here. Disney is garbage for sure, I decided.
This is so perfect, Jesus you are hilarious
Jokes on producer guy the episode on corosunt was the best one of the season
Disney really knows how to fumble the ball do they? They rig their own shows thinking that money will back them up for some reason
Well it fits the pattern of luring fans into a show/movie expecting it to be about the main character only to find out it's another girl boss story. The best part of modern movies/shows are channels like this pointing out the glaring stupidity of the 3rd grade writers they now placed beloved franchises in charge of.
By far the best episode yet
Oh, producer guy's cream being in another castle is TIGHT
this has to be one of my favorite pitch meeting, thank you
I'm dead. I really enjoyed this season of Mando, but this has me screaming. 😂
I love the intern bit, conversely I actually like the sidequest episode. Idk I just think it's neat sue me.
Damn. Took me to 2:04 to figure out what he was doing. Bravissimo.
It's official guys and gals. Pitch Meeting: Interns streaming to you globally this summer😂.
disney: were also going to change the theme song at the begining because reasons and piss so many people off viewers: FU##in HELL
Ok, ok, I tell you what... No
Also, why make such a big deal about how no one will follow the queen without the darksaber... and then she loses it *again* and suddenly nobody cares?  And what was with the way they made fun of democracy in the celeb cameo episode?
Now this is what watching Mandalorian season 3 felt like.
Ryan this is 💯 the best episode you have done. Outstanding job. Had me 😂 from the opening line…
I am now so invested in Intern Guy's story. I hope we get to see more of him in later videos.
The intern needs his own spin off show/channel now that no one asked for 😂
Oh boy. I would love it if Pitch Meeting 'plot holes' are being addressed in different Pitch Meeting videos, and if the viewers don't get it, then it's their problem. The viewers have to watch all Pitch Meeting videos kapish😂.
we need a Ryan verse cinemetic stuff stuff
This episode did more for teaching the next generation how to tell good stories than the last 3 years of Disney entertainment combined. 😊
Reassuring to know producers still hire interns in this economy.
Yeah... that pretty much sums it up.  Bath, bath, bath, side char side quest with no impact, random celeb cameos while weirdly dunking on democracy, then the mandos suddenly set aside thousands of years of bitter differences and go home, but home is invaded so they crash their ginormous ship into the bad guy... and then after finally getting a real home, Mando leaves to go live in a shack.
We used to just assume you watched all these awesome movies and shows before making your content.  That seemed like a pretty cool job.    .............. now I just wanna say we REALLY appreciate the work you do.   This CANNNOT be super  easy anymore.         :because all entertainment sux.   😢
Imagine a grocery store refusing to sell you something, but giving it to you free if you work lmao.
This was fantastic hahahaha
I was wondering how this video was 7 minutes long but the moment I saw the intern, I knew 😂
Pedro seriously never came to set? Lol wow i didn't think this season could get any lamer
That side quest was so nice I had to watch it twice xD
I honestly didn't realize the plot hole of Moff Gideon knowing where they were, yet waiting for them to destroy his clones. Like, what?
Lol this whole sketch was me during the whole season. SMH
Ryan you are an absolute Genius you get better every time keep it up please !!!
Hey he said the thing then showed guys doing the thing he said😂.
Pulling the cameos out of the bag cost me $5.75 for the spilled frappe but I would pay it again in a heartbeat - that was just pure gold 💛
while Mandalorian S3 might have failed as a show. it succeeds in being a guide on what not to do
I cant believe how badly this show got. I stopped watching it after episode 3. I watched videos on the rest of it and i made the right decision not wasting more time on it.
I said your She-Hulk pitch meeting was your magnum opus. I was wrong. So very wrong.
And then Moffenshmirtz yelled out, “Curse you Mando the Mandalorian!”
It's extremely sad because of how true this is  Brilliant
The “intern” bit was a point well taken, and probably one of the reasons why I didn’t watch season 3 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No disrespect to Mandalorian culture, but they really need to pick a new location 😂
I was confused and then I got it.  I see what you did there. Love the random celeb name-pulling.
Okay this is hilarious but in their defense he was with Bokatan the entire time. It was his story too. They were uniting mandalore. 😅
"We're Disney. Watch everything we make or else." Totally sums up their mentality in every possible way.
Hands down, BEST PITCH EVER!
Just like How It Should Have Ended, Pitch Meeting has transcended Parody and Critique and rapidly entered the realm of Improvement Upon the Source Material
This Accuracy is the Way
Turns out the “somehow [bad guy] returned” and clones plot line doesn’t work any better here than Rise of Skywalker…
It's not a true Disney+ show unless the guy that works at the store gets a spinoff
Intern guys quest for the cream was more engaging to watch than Season 3 of the Mandalorian.
So... the show is made by You.... Ryan and George?? that is only 3 guys.... what is the name of the 4th guy... the second intern that took the last of the cream?? ;) ;)
Every time I watch Ryan I feel divided between getting rid of all these western big corporations/technocrat psychopaths and maybe even capistalism, who knows right? I can dream! Hey, don't tell me what to do ok? who keep creating this mass media cancer where the only goal is to brain wash people into keeping them and their family passively ingesting this crap for the rest of their lives while monopolizing every single media outlet on the planet and making mankind believe that capitalism is the only viable economic system. This means there can be no imaginable alternative - it is like a pervasive atmosphere that affects areas of cultural production, political-economic activity, and general thought. All that is left is the consumer-spectator, trudging through the ruins and the relics. It is destroying every art form and human expression, making the content culture stronger and deeper in our consciousness. Technologically, we are headed to zero priced goods, unmesurable work, exponential take off in productivity and the extensive automation of physical processes. Socially, we are trapped in the world of monopolies, inefficiency, the ruin of a finance dominated free-market and a proliferation of bullshit jobs. That... and not having Ryan have endless content for us to watch while we cathartically clap in unison. It's ok... I prefer Ryan hehe
The "it's super easy, barely an inconvenience" line never gets old
And once he gets to that planet, Mando will need to ... kill  ... 28 ... grandfather's hammers ... from the City of Wraith.
Making a pitch meeting longer than most others to demonstrate the sidequesty nature Mandalorian plot points is TIGHT.   Seriously, you nailed it. This made me laugh so hard!
Star Wars villains love somehow returning!
hateeeee this season so much
"Somehow Moff Gideon has returned".  😀
So, when do we get _The Book Of Producer Guy's Assistant?_
Came here so I didn't have to watch the full season.
This episode gave me DragonBall z story writing vibes. 😂
Genius! 😂😂😂
This is the Way
I've decided this is the best place to to point out that In The final episode Mando legit plays a real life "gun game" mode like it's cod as he progresses through the gates to the final boss.   Fun point. In the fight against M.G vs B.K B.K get way more hits in than she should as it later reveald that M.G has like 12 secret weapons that he for some reason chose not to use until it was 2v1 even though they would have easily won him the fight 100times over. Also....why did he just break the dark saber after going crazy trying to secure it all that time.
Pitch meeting expanded universe 😍😍
Sorry I used the cream you need to go to the store. I will go to the store.  Perfect reproduction of the show 😂
Intern Guy stole the show honestly.
Having interns go to the store to get cream and go on sidequests is TIGHT!
I clapped when Producer Guy got his coffee.
Thanks for confirming. I don't need to watch this season.   Disney, where intellectual property goes to die.
The pitch of this chanel is WAY better than the actual 3rd season of ze mandawhatthehellhappenedtojonlorian...
On-point biting satire is TIGHT
Perfectly shows what a crap-fest Mando 3 was 👍
clever.
Producer guy has finally lost his mind
Bwah hah hah hah!!!!!!!
How did the survivors not know of the base of moff Gideon   How do you build a whole base, get supplies, soilders and nothing
Hey Ryan, there is a script writer guy on YouTube that can help you write a script for the end thing. He has over 1 million subscribers.  😋
I have a confession to make. After what happened with Game of Thrones and Disney’s Star Wars films, in addition to the nauseatingly inescapable popularity of “Baby Yoda”, I took a big chance and decided to never watch a single episode of The Mandalorian. I think I can safely say that I made the right call.
Ahh the intern story has made me quit disney lol
that fact that I was actually tempted to skip intern guy's plot just drives home producer guy's point 😂
I want an intern show
I was hoping these characters would come back! What was everyone’s favorite character who finally got a chance at the spotlight!
I was more intrigued by intern guy’s side quest than the entire 3rd season of Mando 😅
Brilliant
Man season 3 is probably my favorite of any of the live action shows so far
Can we have an intern guy spin-off series about the man who made the plunger? That's the kind of content I'm looking for.
The best pitch meeting ever. Absolutely nailed it 👌🏻 👏
Epic production value with all those traveling shots, this episode must have cost millions.
Once again you nailed it!!! 😂
Now its canon that we have been watching multiple producer guys this entire time.
Ryan George I really liked this pitch meeting. Like. A lot. But it's weird that I liked it so much cuz pssst... I didn't even watch most of this season of Mandalorian. Like I used to watch it but I found the first couple episodes of this season to be uh.. well... En Francais ...not good. But see. Even though I dont like the show anymore I loved your pitch meeting cause I thought it did a really good job of satire. Yup. Ok. Thanks. Good job. Bye
Sad you didn’t mention the weird cyborg with the one giant eyeball but I loved everything else, great work as always 🎉
Was definitely expecting a man-delorian joke with Chris Loyd
I see what you did there 🤣
Legitimately giggled uncontrollably all the way through the side quest
Lost me at the coffee part. Not really that funny…
damn, didn't think they were working so far away from any kind of store where you might find food
i hope people at disney watch this
Absolutely hilarious! The part with the interns was pure genius! And picking the names for the cameos out of a hat! LOL! This was WAY better than watching the entire cr*ppy season.
The Mandalorian is terrible; season 1 only appeared good because the sequels were just that bad
unlike the Disney shows, the intern's subplot is actually interesting
Your to funny man love it
Never really liked the show anyway
I wish disney never bought marvel nor star wars
my favourite pitch meeting so far. so true it hurts
This is not making me want to watch the new season...
Is it true Pedro wasn't on the set, which was why he never took off the helmet? Or is that just a rumor?
This is your magnum opus my friend
The intern needs his own spinoff.
Great vid as always Ryan!
The whole coffee gag failed to prove the point most people think it should have proven, I Was deeply invested in intern guy's story. As always these are great.
god the intern subplot thing just perfectly describes how much of an asshole disney is in forgetting their TITULAR CHARACTER!
I was waiting for the Intern to kill the Producer guy and then become the new Producer guy.
The Moff Gideon clone plot could have been used and drawn out much more. It would have been awesome to see a clone fight with him and his own come trying to out evil him.  Lol
Man, you really manage to top yourself every time!
That side character quest was quite fun!
Ryan rarely misses with the issues with a show. The Mandalorian S3 jumped the shark.
Was the intern needing to fix the toilet in order to get creamer another reference to how every episode mando needs something so he has to do something for someone else first?
Love the videos 😂
"Yeah, SOMETIMES..." 😂
They’re too greedy and stupid. Too bloated with studio executives. They will never again make a good show or movie.
Lmao. 😅😅
There is justifiably a lot of salt in this episode, it’s spot on.
This is easily the best episode of Pitch Meeting
Ryan I don't have words to express how talented you are.. Your sense of humour is top notch.... Died laughing..... What aaa masterpiece
I can’t believe they made me watch stupid boba fett. I can’t believe they brought in Lizzo. I can’t believe they cut out Mando and Grogu, no doubt already planning their next spin offs. They had one job.
I see......you have chosen violance.
I appreciate that I don't even need to watch the shows that the pitch meetings are about in order to follow the conversations between screenwriter guy and producer guy. 😄
Ryan George is *_fucking brilliant_*     It's kind of overwhelming. . .
I have so many questions about how you shot that car commercial—I mean side-quest.
loved the side quest, so on point
That intern bit was the most cutting commentary/critique in the last decade.
Disney: Let's have three A-list celebs with prior acting credits appear in this. Internet: I am outraged!
New character~ Long live Intern!
How is this channel popular? There are no good jokes here with the same cut pacing over and over and over.....
It took me a minute for me to understand what he was doing
Haha the intern driving scene made me feel more than the Mandalorian side quests
My favorite pitch meeting by far
Sometimes in comparison to the original show your pitch meetings look like PhD meetings in comedy ^w^
I didn’t even watch the final episode. Look how they massacred my boy!
It turned into a car commercial at 2:28
Best side quest in the universe!
Best episode of the Nadalorian yet...
0:40 important baths are tight! 🤣 like a mikveh bath? I never felt so educated while laughing at racist stereotypes.
This has gotta be one of his best pitch meetings
Already the long car ride scene reminded me of the endless walking scenes in Lord Of The Rings (where even the trees walk) and that it is how JRR Tolkien used to write, at times.
LOL he literally pulls names out of a hat
Laughed more than usual with this one.
People really PAY to watch these garbage shows STILL???
I honestly did NOT enjoy the side episode on The Mandalorian, HOWEVER, I absolutely LOVED this!!!!
OMG....  Genius!!!
Ryan's keeping these fresh. Man's a comedic legend
I'm so glad this became its own channel. I didn't subscribe for the longest time cus I just wasn't a big fan of Screen Rant. You are by far the best decision they will ever make. A true artist and performer, you never fail to entertain. Wishing you all the luck for the future.
FRIGGEN!!! HILARIOUS!!! No joke… I’d for real (no foolies) rather watch more “intern guy” adventures than ever watch any Boba Fett show ever again. “Get those turds all the way outa there”
I for real unclogged a toilet today... where is my creamer?!
Every pitch meeting is a banger but the most recent ones are seriously next-level, way to go Ryan!
The Pitch Meeting Universe is expanding!!
Damn. I really want to know what happened to intern guy.
Never see intern guy again? He must return to do another scenic tour quest again! He must. Come on...
Gideon bought his clonenator from Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz.
That side quest was more memorable that the ones in the show. lol Seriously I barely remember any of them..
Hahahaha genius segue
so brilliant
In case you didn't notice he took a minimal plot point and stretched it way out to fill up a video... Ryan is smort 🤭
Katie Sackhoff is so hot. Not hot enough to watch the show, but I like seeing her in pictures.
Did you write that amazing side quest music too, Ryan?
Store Guy's lopsided fake moustache is the guest star I didn't know I needed.
Another great roast! If someone can't handle one's favorite franchise being mocked then maybe they need to chill out a bit and take up a hobby or something, and god knows that Disney's Star Wars needs mocking, and lots of it. I'll still watch it all, but most of it just doesn't make sense or is a mess. All of these shows are basically filler, secondary and tertiary stories that aren't essential to the central plot. And now everything's supposed to make the sequel trilogy make sense. Good luck there. But might as well have some fun at it.
I think that this was the longest pitch meeting ever.  Kind of took an unexpected turn with the outdoor scenes.  Don't know why, but that part made me laugh harder than the rest of it.  😂
I love the Mandalorian series so much and even I gave up after a few episodes this season 😭
Huh so, the classic bug-eyed thumbnail... actually kinda look decent on the Mando helmet.
We need a series starring intern guy 😂
I _really_ had expected the giant Mythosaur Chekov's Gun to go off in the final episode on Mandalorian Season 3, but it didn't. If I had written the script, the Mandalorians fleeing from Moff Gideon's troopers would've hidden deeper in the mines until Bo'Katan remembers the Living Waters below the mines and how she saw the Mythosaur there. She would've taken the Darksaber and dived down to awaken the Mythosaur & tame it, fulfilling the prophecy that the Mythosaur will arise when they need it most. The creature would destroy Gideon's base and swallow Gideon. Now _that_ would've proven Bo'Katan's right to be the leader of new Mandalore! And be a perfect karmic death for Moff Gideon!  Instead the script writers had that weird other giant reptile burst from the ground to attack the barge in a random encounter straight from a D&D campaign, just so the gamemaster could drive the protagonists underground at the _perfect_ spot where they would find a cave entrance that leads down to Moff Gideon's lair... a giant lair that Din Djarin and Bo'Katan somehow missed the last time they were there recently, when they bathed in the Living Waters? Huh?   And after that attack that giant lizard was completely forgotten, nobody commented on it? And it clearly wasn't the Mythosaur: It looks different, no horns, and the final episode showed the Mythosaur still sleeping under the waters. So, yeah, I really wanted to see the Mythosaur awaken, hello scriptwriters? Did you special effects budget run out of money?
Disney deserves whatever is coming to it. Them. Xer. Fuck it. I don’t care anymore. SURPRISE! I never cared.
No he didn't. LOL my boy stretched the F*** out that plot point. 🤣 😂
Hey, you can't misrepresent Disney this way... you totally left out how they're trying to hard-sell homosexuality to little children.
Kathleen Kennedy is the worst thing that ever happened to Star Wars
Interns???
jesus! i wasnt expecting that..lmao
I enjoyed the episodes that didn't focus on Mando.  We already got two seasons and two bonus episodes that were focused on Mando, he's already done all of the things he was gonna do, I'm happy to get something else going on in the meantime.
The characters for the Ryan George channel/ universe are taking over Pitch Meetings... which is great bc those videos keep getting better and better 😂maybe, who's to say 🤷‍♂️
That intern bit was one of the best ways to describe the constant inadequacies at Disney😂❤
Can’t wait for that Intern Guy spin-off show 😂
People keep telling me The Mandalorian is great and I need to watch it, but it doesn't seem like it's very good.
Apart from the Mandalorians setting up their camp on the shores of a lake that is full of giant crocodile monsters, in a desert that has giant pteranodon monsters, what bugged me was how their jetpacks' efficiency was entirely plot-dependant, as it flip-flopped between "Not even enough fuel to follow one flying Godzilla reject all the way to its nest" in one episode to "These things have endless fuel that never runs out" in the last two episodes, where the Mandalorian forces drop out of a spaceship in low orbit, fly down to the surface (instead of dropping most of the way in freefall and then using the jetpacks to slow their descent), then fly away from the Random Encounter Monster, and then have aerial battles underground in the mines against Moff Gideon's troopers, and _then_ one of them flies al lthe way up from the bottom of the mines through the crack in the cavern into the sky and _into space_ back to the fleet in orbit.  I kept expecting his jetpack to fail and him to plunge to his death, but surprisingly he made it. Huh.
Dont know how to phrase this... but i am genuine more interested im a season 2 of that Coffee guy than i am for anything future star wars related.
Best one yet!!!!!
My god I can’t hit the “like” button on this any harder -lol.
Disney is trash now
😂
That was the most clever way to show (not tell) why season 3 of mando didn't work
Y'all still watch this? I know it was fucked when they tricked an stst into walking into a hole like it was a dog....a very retarded dog. And it didn't just simply level that village with dudes holding spears...  That said, if they'd only released 4 episodes s1 would have been damn near a masterpiece because the good episodes were solid. They watered it down too much trying to make enough "content."  I stopped after like episode 2 of s2, sensing the lack of narrative direction. Disney hit me up if you want to make money again
Nailed it!!!
That side-quest was legit turning into a car commercial. I half expected to hear a Matthew McConaughey voice over.
One of the best Pitch Meeting Episodes ever
What? I mean. What. Hold on.  I mean.  What
New characters!!
The show moves as fast as a daytime soap.  Question:  What would be more entertaining, a 45 min pitch video or a Mandalorian episode?
You did miss how the flying thing that snatched the Mandolorian kid would kill him if it got wind of them trying to stage a rescue (as had happened before, no less), but then the writers totally forgot about that when they finally encountered it in its nest. It’s so nice that Disney is providing jobs for people with anterograde amnesia. I’m just not sure the script department is the right fit for them.
I haven't even seen the season he's pitching, but omfg. This has to be the best visualization of the reviews I have seen for this series. Like legit. Ryan's content never disappoints. 10/10. Every video is solid gold, super easy barely an inconvenience.
This is one of the best gags ever 😅!!!
why does this pitch meeting feels like it was made for normies not the lore fans ? tho all the points are right
The hat gag KILLED. <3
Loved it, especially the very important intern story.
Gave up cream in my coffee for new years and it took a bit to get used to but ill never go back, coffee tastes so much better and you notice the subtle differences between different types.
oh putting a car commercial in your pitch meeting is tight , an getting coffee is super easy barely an inconvenience
4:52 Those aren't stormtroopers. They're Imperial Super Commandos.
Side quest was so funny
OMG the pulling of celebrity cameos out of the hat is the most one point thing ever. This season just had cameos for no reason other then to try and distract from the shit show that the plot was.
"We're Disney watch everything we make or else!"  Kathleen Kennedy probably.
Interns padding the running time is tight!
LOLing from 0:31. So good...
wowowowowow i didn’t see that side quest coming
"Oh wow, I also just for a call from Lego. They said after around 10 years they're making a unique darksabre piece that will come in some sets releasing in May so that'll be cool" Writer guy: ....
I hope the intern gets a spin off series.
Season 3 was definitely the worst and made me want to give up watching the show forever!
Best Episode Yet!
Je ne haïrais pas ça revoir le stagiaire une fois de temps en temps. :)
🤣 oh man Star Wars is so dead!
they're milking hard that sidequesting in this sidequesting fan-service show
Ohh, Star Wars bad guys love SOMEHOW returning!
That store was far.
Good Job Ryan! Its got to be hard putting yourself out there..
I benched whole season in one go and had wierd felling that something was way off in this season and I realised that Mando was side character in HIS show .... I can forget slow boring show but this was too much (last 2 episodes are good) but if there was more and better settup for it instead RNG sidequests it would be even better
I actually agree that if someone doesn't watch all of Disney Star Wars they have no one to blame but themselves. What kind of maniac would watch The Mandalorian and not Boba Fett?
Intern twist was awesome lol
Can't wait to see what happens with Intern guy, I think his character is really going places
The tempo of the hat name picking joke was just perfect
I figured he'd have to go to Tatooine to get the cream.
This season had me like "Wow wow wow.....                                                                                .....wow."
2:20 - Dude, I pissed my pants! Another great episode, one of the best!
This is the way.
"So Bo Katan needs the dark saber to rule Mandalore, but Din Djarin has it" "Wow, that seems like it's gonna cause quite a bit of conflict and be difficult to resolve" "Actually it's super easy, barely an inconvenience"
Funny stuff! But I did enjoy the cameo sequences. Not like Lloyd is going to do anything really action packed, but it was fun seeing him.  And Jaxk Black it's just awesome.  Lizzo, I didn't know who that was really,  but I'm fine with her as well.  All of the cameos did good with their parts at least.
This was your magnum opus, Ryan.  Well done!  😂
Exactly!
That was just so good.
I really hope Disney sees this, to understand just how much their interference messed up this season.
Ryan has moved into the realm of genius with this episode
Mams went on a whole quest for cream
Wow, I think that's you best one yet
I think Moff Gideon hired Doofenshmirtz to finish his cloning project.
😂 the intern thing was great. So on point
Side quests are tight!
Compared to that third episode, the intern segment was absolutely riveting
This has got to be one of the best reviews of season 3 that I have seen so far.
Soooo brutal 😂😂😂 But perfect pitch Very tight
Bro Moff Gideon really turned into Doofenshmirtz in this season
iNTERN SPIN-OFF! INTERN SPIN-OFF!
Kathleen Kenedy needs to go. Bait and switch every movie/series. Kathleen just wants to brainwash GenZ and GenX boys into thinking girls are better than them, doesn't she? Her fetish of glorifying girls goes hand in hand with bringing down boys and men. This is an attack on our kids. She should be in jail.
I want to know more about the intern's adventures! Please make a spin off about him!
Pitch Meeting: The Intern Intern Meeting Intern #2 Try-outs To Be Producer Guy #2 Pitch Meeting: Intern Guy #2 Gets a Promotion and Become Producer Guy #2  You've set the precedent. Don't leave us hanging. 👀
It finally happened. The universal barrier was shattered. We have witnessed Ryan George in the Multiverse of Madness.
To be fair, _The Book of Boba Fett_ was basically _The Mandalorian_ Season 2.5 Just as The Mandalorian_ Season 3 suddenly decided to have a little crossover with _Andor_ (just in a different time period, 20 years later, with the First Order rising instead of the Empire) to resolve that hanging plot thread of what happened to the geneticist and Moff Gideon. At least Gideon's motives were not tied to the movie sequels and the cloning of Sith Emperor Palpatine and instead to a whole different cloning! The huge bombshell being that Gideon figured out how to give non-Force-users Force powers (even if he couldn't yet do it via genetic splicing into already born people).  I blame George Lucas, honestly, for inventing those "Midichlorians" as a genetic, physical base for the Force powers. That was so unneccessary... and totally broke the original trilogy. At least the writers of the _The Mandalorian_ asked the logical question: Why can't Midichlorians be transfered or cloned themselves? If they're basically cell organelles.
Pure genius Ryan, pure genius🫡🫡
The Mandalorian Pitch Meeting: The Return of the Sidequest
Side Quests are tight!
Omg yes all the way to the store I love you going all the way with this bit
Excellent pitch meeting only missing a few things, like the fact that they ended up making the dark saber into a piece of worthless fodder after all this time and turning Din Djarin into a secondary character to give the glory to Bo katan because waman have to be better in every way.
"Mando is gonna take a bath" Well, that's one way to summarize the whole "This is the Way/living waters of Mandalore/giant underwater lizards" plotline. 😁
Getting producer guy coffee is tight.
This is the way, barely an inconvenience.
Nice MAGA hat, Ryan lol. Good for you. You've really grown the last few years. I remember when covid started, you believed every single stupid thing the media shoved down your throat and then you were a total prick to half your audience about it. Undoing brainwashing is tight!
I laughed way too much with that intern side plot. 😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Intern gag was funny but it took away from explaining points in the show…like Anything about Bo Katan or the Madalorian holdouts still living there.
Isn't the only other entire season of a show Game of Thrones Season 8? Good company for Mandalorian Season 3
For some reason I keep waiting for an "Oh, wow, wow, wow..." moment to go on a few seconds longer, that cuts from Producer Guy to Screenwriter Guy and back again several times with Screenwriter Guy waiting for the last "wow" to the point that Screenwriter Guy nods, looks at his script, looks around the room, and checks his watch before Producer Guy finally says it.
Like my comment to show that you watch pitch meeting instead of watching the show now and it’s far better super easy barely an inconvenience 😂
Poor Intern Guy, we'll never see one of his mini adventures again. Unless it's super easy, barely an inconvience.
Probably the best episode ever
First
I hope Disney watches these lol
GENIYS
golden again
Out of all the reviews I’ve seen about TM Season 3, this is the best.
This is the way         to take Pitch Meeting to the next level. Amazing :-)
Oh, inserting footage from car commercials is tight!
This one is gold! I haven't even seen this season, but I couldn't stop smiling the whole time. Your sense of humor is my favorite
You sir, are a genius 😂
I. LOVE. THIS.
2:17 is that a hyper specific obscure Friends reference of Ben Stiller?
Yeah at this point I just didn’t care about s3… and based on this pitch meeting that was the right decision
I love how every Mando pitch meeting gets ridiculously off-track
Oh so disappointing.  I was expecting a 3 episode Pitch Meeting for this.
brilliant dissing 😂
This is the best one yet.
Love the intern sub quest. Better than entire Mando season 3 😂
What the fuck happened to my comment? Was it too long?
Intern Gag excellent, Hahahaha 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
No no no no no NO NO. DOUBLE THIS MAN'S PAY 😭😭 WHATEVER HE EARNS, ISN'T ENOUGH. This was awesome 🤣😂
EPIC
"Are we really going to spend three episodes on this?" "Yes sir" "And since this is modern times, we'll only bother to make eight episodes for the whole damn thing, because we suddenly can't make more than eight episodes for anything ever?" "That's right"
The thumbnail helmet is actually more practical than the shows
Thank you!
Took me a minute and a half to realize that was a meta joke about the joke. 3:36 NOOO!!
"Ow, Star Wars bad guys love some how returning!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Brilliant
Didn't bring up Grogu piloting a mech built from, essentially, a dead person's remains.
The most accurate part was by far the "Don't worry about him, we're never gonna see him again..."
One good thing that comes out of Disney's gross regurgitations: we get infinite pitch meeting skits.😂
Man, of only he didn't install that button....
"We're Disney. Watch everything we make, or else." Disturbingly accurate.
To be honest, I thought "intern guy" was gonna fight "intern guy" for the last creamed coffee.
Perfect!
one of the best pitch meetings!
So when is the Andor Pitch Meeting?
Wait, how do stormtroopers beat mandalorians with their literal plot armour that is immune to blasters and sometimes immune to physical force?
To be fair, the Christopher Lloyd character and his performance were really good.
I doze of for a bit and suddenly the intern took over..... I have to recheck if I click on Pitch Meeting, not George Ryan chanell 😂😂😂
I'm so looking forward to the next intern meeting! 🙂
This Pitch Meeting was legit better than the season.
Love the implication at 3:36 that the intern is getting fired for taking too long with the coffee.
Is season 3 really this bad?  I've purposely been avoiding it.
I found the "Pulling random names from a hat" bit a little insulting... Everyone knows Disney uses a blindfold and a dart board for major decisions like that.
It was messy but I enjoyed watching it (I was super high)
Things are don't care for but will watch pitch meeting
Blow Out vibes with the meta storytelling
Disney continues to drop the ball with Star Wars. I use to consider Mandalorian the most refreshing Star Wars series but then it got popular and it became  stale like everything else Disney touches. It's really just a victim of a much bigger problem in our culture right now. Everything is just so safe, from a financial standpoint, causing it to lack soul. I hope pop culture in general can reorganize and stop relying on nostalgic and safe bets to make their products. It's all just getting so boring.
“Somehow, morph Gideon returned”  Subtle
US city planning is extremely weird, I would have assumed there'd be a store closer to a seemingly downtown location.
WOW, this is the best Pitch Meeting I've seen!! Brilliant on so many levels!
so glad I randomly watch this one
Star Wars bad guys love Some How returning
Ngl this is my favorite pitch meetings by far😂😂the intern gag was genius
This episode blew my mind…
Ok, now I want to see an Intern Guy spinoff show where, about halfway through the season, he gets sidelined and the series mainly focuses on Producer Guy.
I half expected the whole episode to be them explaining the importance of the bathing scene and how it needs a whole episode.
Laugh out loud funny, amazing!
99% of this show is just a side quest after a side quest and it’s just not going anywhere. They also had the main character that we followed for the past 2 seasons as a side character.
I’m sorry Ryan but this is genius you have to stop you’re making all the others on the platform look bad
Mr. RG, or may I just address you as RG?(Seems like Producer Guy would have initials for a name), anyways, RG, you are Funny!! Annoying hilarious. Really appreciate your work/comedy.
Tru
omg producerguy have an intern...how long there are already three people in the room? And what are producer guys intern´s dream? I want to knwo more about the intern guy! <3
I'm Irish so I curse alot... F ME Ryan you are a genius bcus this is exactly how I felt during that season
Funniest PM yet...
Omg I came here to watch a pitch meeting why are we wasting time with this stupid cream side quest?!!!
´Show, dont’ tell’ right? So clever to simply illustrate your point by an overproduced montage that has nothing to do in any pitch meeting. Love you❤
Taking a big blockbuster movie/tv show and throwing a car commercial in the middle is also vintage disney
Woah woah woah woah.. woah. Three new characters to keep track of? Pitch Meeting lore is getting confusing af.
What is happening
Viewership was disappointing to Disney?  Well, this season was disappointing to us, as was Book of Boba Fett and Kenobi.
Ironically many of these new shows are styled like comic books, and in a comic book series its very common to have cross-overs where the main story continues in a different comic book series. Can make it REALLY confusing when you only have a subscription to one series and cant find the other one anywhere 😂
You forgot the fact that Mando becomes a side character and Bo Katan is now the hero
This is the best video you've ever made.
Pitch meeting has transcended comedy clips and has become legit amazing social commentary.
Oh no, no more intern guy the days to come will be sad indeed
THE INTERN omg Ryan how does it feel to be the funniest person on the internet??
Ya this season wasnt too great. I would still like to see a season 4 cuz ending it here is just weird. I dont understand people he see one bad movie and dont want to see anything in that franchise ever again, *cough* episode 9 *cough.*
I know its a joke but i actually enjoyed the world building by including the episode “There and back again: an Intern’s tale.” 😂
Anyone ever notice the clones are wrong? Gideon's clones are made old from the start. They should've started young so that they can be put through accelerated learning and growth. Now his clones are going to be incredibly dumb.
Great sketch! I still love The Mandalorian.
I'm so glad I didn't watch it, thank you sir!
Brilliant. I love the bit about how main characters should be main characters. I hate this ensemble bull shit.
I know it's not super relevant, but if you ever do older films, it would be hilarious to see one for "Junior". I want to see the pitch for a pregnant Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Points for using a clean toilet for the story.      S3 had far too much pointless traveling and pointless Bo Katan and too much Jack Black and Lizzo .... which is basically if they appear it is too much
I realize that was just a sight gag, but please tell me you threw away that sink plunger you stuck in the toilet. Sink plungers and toilet plungers are different things for a reason. You wouldn’t clean your sink with a toilet brush, would you?
This is so awesome 😂😂😂
The ultimate fetch quest!
This is my favorite pitch meeting
As much as I am a huge fan of Star Wars, you hit the nail on the head with these, Ryan. I hate what Disney (and probably the writing team) is doing to the show (including BoBF and Kenobi). Andor made it glaringly clear that Disney is capable of having far greater stories, but they choose to go with gimmicks and cheap tricks to make this show. A good way to see the true quality of this show is to remove the Star Wars skin and you will see that's the only thing keeping the audience invested.  Some gripes I have to vent out: - Grogu could've stayed gone, heightening the impact of his disappearance and folks wouldn't have to watch BoBF to keep updated with the story; (same issue with MCU) - The whole season could've been about retaking Mandalore, and we could see Moff Gideon be more fleshed out; including his plans. What they did instead truly wasted Giancarlo Esposito being the villain. - And why is beskar so abundant? There's little to no stakes in gun fights, making it just a visual spectacle, especially with the beskar-stormtroopers. And falling off cliffs to their doom... really? They have jetpacks!
Honestly, I'm uncertain it's a good idea to do these for Disney properties. After all, who's watched any of them? I've never watched any of the mandolarian or Star Wars tv shows. I stopped watching movies in the cinema and Disney properties anywhere since the Infinity Wars. It's good to learn that my distrust and disapprobation have been well placed.
The intern gag was absolutely brilliant!
I'm pretty sure that side quest was in the mando season 4
Somehow, Cara Dune didn’t return…
Honestly the biggest problem is that the set up in the past two seasons had such a lousy payoff. They hunt Grogu’s for his force abilities this whole time and for what?? We never even see the clones in action.
Good job Mando, you got so sidetracked you sidetracked the Pitch Meeting.
Oh my god... can't wait to find out what happened to pitch guy and producer guy in season one of 'The Assistants'.
Really? A coffee run side quest? I dare say, genius.😂😂😂
Classic. THIS is the way
Both Mandalorian Pitches have expanded the pitch meeting universe in such amazing and unexpected ways. I’m here for it.
This was outstanding
Mate… 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Respectfully I am done with this channel. It was great when the jokes added new layers to the movie critique but lately these have just been the same takes I here all over YouTube. You are starting to sound like a watered-down Nerdotic, and that is never good since that channel is the worst. Plus you didn't even accurately represent the plot of one of the episodes. That is just cheap. All the best, but when I start to get super negative when watching these, I think it's best stop.  You are super talented, and that's just my criticism of your stuff, but I'm out.
This is the way (more entertaining choice over the actual season it satirizes).
Quite frankly the guy playing the intern isn't cutting it, Might want to recast the role
One of the best pitch meetings! Can’t wait to see what other adventures intern guy will be up to in the future
Skipping the rest of the season after the insultingly bad first episode was super easy, barely an inconvenience
I was more interested in the intern side quest than I was with any of the side quest in mando season 3 combined.
Lol this whole skit is that intern looking for creamer, huh?
Hi Ryan! Making a Pitch Meeting for The Room is Super Easy, Barely an Inconvenience!
Was really driving his points home
Brilliant!
Do a pitch meeting on the Departed
Awesome intermission - need more of this - foreshadowing we never see the intern again is counter productive. Retract that statement!
The cashier's moustache falling off mid-sentence
I get that Screen Rant pays the bills, but what an awful joke of a "source" for the claim that nobody is watching.
Bro why haven’t u done an Andor pitch meeting that show is way better than any of this garbage
the intern joke is the best joke of the franchise no lies
Oh Intern...we barely knew ye. I'm going to miss you and your bright smile and effervescent personality. I know! Disney should make a spin off series for you!
love the side quests! great gag to show how shows are made.
Ryan George just increased the Pitch Meeting Cinematic universe
I clicked on this video to watch producer guy and pitch guy not interns lol
Mandalorian season 3 is good at taking worthless side quests and stretching them out, all the while taking major plot points like Mando redeeming himself and Mandalorians reclaiming their home world and making them a quick side quest.
We’ve reached the next phase of Pitch Meeting lore.
I hated the intern gag, hope we never, ever, ever... ever....... ever... see him again. Here, have my like!
I really enjoy when Ryan occasionally does these long winded bits. First,in the mandalorian pitch meeting with the money eyes bit and now this one with the intern side-quest.  It's great.
That's this show
God, Hollywood is awful.
Peak comedy 😂🎉
You sir are an artist 12/10 episode
This pitch meeting is better than the actual series!
Ryan, loved it... you did a wonderful job. You da Man!
These just keep getting better and better. Hilarious ;)
my favourite pitch meetings are the ones that break the usual format like how the tenet one had that whole b plot about how the dialogue scenes take place in different locations
The Mike Stoklasa inside me is already taking control in less than an minute of the video , ooh , the pain ..
Never thought someone could say "ye it's all clogged up with turds" in such a funny tone lol. Love it
Do A-Team
Please do cloud atlas !
Accepting turds as payment is TIGHT.
WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?! Am I living in one of the alternate universes where there isn't a Pitch Meeting for Everything Everywhere All at Once?
Love your work you are the best
Intern Guy's side quest was gripping and eventful. More please.
That cream excursion is more interesting than anything that’s happened in Star Wars in forty years
I was wondering why this Pitch Meeting was so long. Then the intern arrived.
I'm very impressed with his green screen driving
BRING BACK THE INTERN FOR THE FUTURE
NO WE NEED THE INTERN PLS
Disney is so nice to let Ryan post one of the deleted episodes of the Mandalorian!
Mandalorian has joined the club of literally braindead writing along with its brothers Boba and Obi-wan 😂 Good lord Disney get it together..
I love how he's all like. Taking plot points and stretching them out is what Disney does the best and that's exactly what he's doing with the intern. Taking a plot point of him getting coffee and just stretching it out as long as he can lol. I totally get it
Best evah.
It was a terrible season  I was so excited every Wednesday for nothing at all
I think s3e3 is by far my favorite Mandalorian episode.
Seemed more like bad marketing than the season being bad.  I don’t remember seeing a single ad for it
Brilliance.  Pure unadulturated brilliance.  Especially since good coffee is always worth it.
I never thought I would ever laugh like crazy while watching a car driving through some random scenery...  Seems that watching a car driving through random scenery is tight...
Love it
Me: How long do you need to stretch the intern scene? Ryan: Yes
I stopped watching halfway through season 1...guess I'm glad I took the hint.
"We're Disney. Watch everything we make or else." That hurt as a Marvel fan.
I haven't seen any Star Wars in years but is there a consensus that the coffee side mission in this video is better than anything in Mando season 3?
This video was spot on. Love it. 😀
One of his best pitch meeting yet. Pure 🥇
That intern bit was absolutely excellent.
Genius.  Next level stuff.
“Now that I’m caffeinated, we can keep going”
Just saw the intern bit. How do you double subscribe?
#interngang
This is absolutely brilliant 😂
When he pulled the names out of the hat, that got me. That's the most accurate thing about this pitch meeting.
😂😂😂 Intern, names out of a hat(probably how it went down), just brilliant! Well executed. Bravo Ryan! 👏👏👏👌👍
I thought it’s called “Pitch Meeting” and not “Side Quest of the Intern”.
Hey, so you were much positively mentioned in The Critical Drinker Bar tonight. So cool to see an intermixing, interwining of youtuber shows kind of thing, there, now. Yeah, cool.
Loved this season (even/especially the Pershing/Elia episode.  I'm a sucker for an interlude!), but this was freaking hilarious!  Probably very telling how much I enjoyed the intern side quest. 😜
Oh no what’s going to happen to Intern guy? I was emotionally invested in his story 😢
Where’s John Wick Chapter 4??
Am I the only one who expected the cream quest to go on for the rest of this video and the Mando S3 Pitch Meeting to conclude on the next?   Disney must have done a number on me.
Bug-eyed Mando in the thumbnail is a more interesting design than the real one
Coming soon to Disney+: Side Quests of the Intern, starring Gian Rarge.
This season felt like an anime filler arc 😒
The side quest had me laughing! Good job!
The intern side quest made me actually laugh out loud but ya this season sucked there was literally nothing good about it
THE SIDE QUEST JOKE!!!!!!!! LMAO!!!!!
The intern gag was tight!!!
👉 Well done, my friend. Well done. (slowly clapping and nodding in approval)
Did you just rick roll us?
So. So. So. SO accurate.
Now I really need an entire movie explaining how the toilet got clogged.
Literally s2 of the Bad Batch (an animated kids show) had a FARRRRR more compelling plot.
This episode of pitch meeting is a masterpiece 😂
Swear I've seen that moustache before somewhere? 🤔
Oh my god it took me way too long to realize what was happening in that intern bit, that was fantastic.
Star Wars is dead 💀 😔
I'm just surprised anyone made it to Season 3
great gag
We need more intern character development. Ideally a full spinoff.
Producerguy should've just dropped the cup upon receiving it, making the whole side quest entirely pointless
This is the best pitch meeting ever!
Hi there, hello.
LoL Disney. Thanks for the free shows. 👍
Nailed it.
Ryan George great job Ryan George
Holy shit, is this the start of the Pitch Meeting Cinematic Universe? I'm so ready for this, that car ride transition was tight!
Tried to watch the Mandalorian season 3, but found it super hard and a huge inconvenience.
ugh, that was such a long episode.  and pointless too.
Mandalorian sucks
Ryan’s getting meta up in this biznitch.
Fetch Quest: The Series
Ryan needs his own serie. I could hear a 30 minute show made by him.
Really haven't been paying attention to the star wars Disney thing but don’t people know that Boba Fett is just a clone of Jango Fett.
Isn't it difficult to condense all the issues that hundreds of commentators spend hours dissecting into a single 7 minute video that perfectly encapsulates and illustrates every problem with the story?  Apparently it's super easy, barely an inconvenience.
This is the whey. Curds are over there.
After season 3, I really really hate hearing "This is the Way"
This Pitch meeting was better written than the whole season 3. Better acted too.
3:17 C'mon! -that's a sink plunger. You need the funny shaped one for the toilet.
We love you Ryan! And This is the way.
Did Intern guy wash his hands before making the coffee, after cleaning the toilet? Will we ever know?!?!
better plot then most disney shows
Dingorang:I don't like when Pitch meetings are about the most recent product, i would still appreciate the pitch itself, but if there's a Pitch meeting i would prefer is one about "Birdemic:shock and terror"
Just like I'm not going to subscribe  It's 2023 I think we know what to do by now
... and so only Andor remains.
I was a big fan of seasons 1 and 2. I didn’t even care about watching season 3 before watching this pitch meeting, and I have absolutely no regrets.
👍🏿
Hahaha!!!!! Laying that side quest on hard!!
How you managed to get the googlie eyes on the Mandalorian's head in the thumbnail. Bravo sir, bravo. 😀👍
Producer guy must loathe the Mandalorian‘s storytelling. It’s loose.
Side Quest!
Of all your Nailed It episodes this one might have the most nails ever. Just fantastic work.
The Mandalorian!:  S1- Well, we successfully cannibalized the Boba Fett movie script, and thanks to some meandering and padding, we had a hit! Bonus, we've finally found something to merchandise since our acquisition! #weallknowwherereyis  S2- Well, we finished off the literal last plot point from the Boba Fett movie, and season 2 was a hit. Unfortunately, we required even more padding and meandering, not to mention a goofy revolving door of cartoon show cameos and the mother of all fan service moments in the finale to just squeak by. Of course, there's no way we'll get away with that for the third season so it's time to drop the gimmicks and really go all in on a tight focused narrative featuring genuine character development meaningful world building and a deep impactful plot that has serious consequences for our characters.  S3- AH CRAP!
I am ashamed to say how long it took for me to understand the intern thing was reinforcing the previous joke.  I literally said out loud "WTf is this crap and why are they not talking about the Manda....ohhhhhhhh...."
Tbh I really liked episode 3. I am all for worldbuilding. The plot of the season is indeed quite stupid, but bad writing is part of the Disney dna these days. For that low bat it was quite decent and I had fun with the show. Only the jack black filler episode was a bit to much - fun, but pointless.
I have never liked a video before watching the full thing, but I saw where this was going and I am here for it! Love you, Ryan! 🤣
Would have loved to see addressed the fact that Mando dropped like a helpless rock at the bottom of the lake when taking his "bath"
This interns journey is much more entertaining than anything Mando did this whole season
Making fun of side quests while the whole show is basically fetch quests…😂
I see what you did there.  Unfortunately, I'm clicking out at, "tur
Intern guy, the side plot we didn’t know we needed 😂
Props to the intern who went all the way to the Japan of the Ryanverse to buy some cream for producer guy.
You know what would have made the intern's side quest even more epic? WALKING IN REAL-TIME! That was a staple of (cheap) movies in the 80s - why oh why don't they use techniques like that any more?
Epic spin off incoming.
I see what you did there
So. Freaking. Epic. One of the best ones ever...
This is the way 🤣🤣🤣🤣👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Silly producer guy, you should know that no men are allowed to be the star of any tvshow, or movie, or game, or comics, or anything really these days, they HAVE to be replaced by strong independent sexless women, even when said show is literally named after the character.
OMG that was so much better than the whole 3rd season.
That was awesome @RyanGeorge
Hands down the best pitch meeting ever. Disney can suck a d*ck
I really hope the writers see this so they know just how ridiculous their structuring is xD
Heh. Well played.
Lol!! Thank you
Kathleen Kennedy don’t screw up Star Wars challenge. Difficulty level: impossible.
So I read 15 Producer Guy/Screenwriter Guy Extended Universe novels, those gawd awful cartoons, the ice show, spend countless hours making costumes for a dozen PGSG-cons.....My God! The tattoos! All those tattoos!... and now, what?!, is NONE of it cannon?!!!!  Intern guys tie was always GREEN!!!!!!! That was his THING!!!!  Why do you hate us, Ryan?
Why are you so great!? Wonderful as always!
I didn't even finish season 1 I recognized they didn't really have much story or an idea of where to go and it felt like a bunch of filler and side quests and was all too self aware
Funniest man on YT.
You fool! Now I want more Intern stuff to watch!
2:17 for a second, I feel like my Hispanic family was with me
wasn't Book of Bobo Fett a season of Mando? it wasn't supposed to be a different show. that's why that year there was no Mando as we know it.
The beauty of Pitch Meetings is that the more of a letdown a movie or show is, the better the content we can expect from Ryan and George. And that’s not me bashing on Disney or Star Wars, I’m genuinely grateful that this channel can help us look on the bright side of things by helping us laugh when we might be disappointed. Mandolarian Season 3 wasn’t what I’d hoped, but here I am entertained all the same by the Pitch Meeting. Thanks, guys!
OH my god the intern GAG
Do I smell a intern spinoff series???
2:00 Intern Guy needs to learn the right time to give a hearty "Oh really?"
Wow wow wow       Wow.
That side story... Like WOW. This was another level of Pitch Meeting hitting a home run.
I...did not know Christopher Lloyd was still alive.
Disney and DC should collaborate...
The funny thing is that it’s okay to complain this stuff now but Loki, Hawkeye, Dr. Strange MOM, all are titled one thing but are actually not about those guys that much at all.
That was perfect!
Was expecting Producer Guy and Writer Guy, was not expecting a Greek tragedy! "The Odyssey of the Intern"!😅
I can't currently remember a funnier pitch meeting! I was rolling!
Where exactly is this studio...?
Do Americans still put cream in their coffee and not just milk? Eeaw!
At the last few minutes of this I realised I hadn't finished watching The Mandalorian lol 😂 I enjoyed the season btw. I don't care about the critics. And I liked the Lizzo and zjack Black cameos
This might be the greatest Pitch Meeting ever. Very well done, not an inconvenience to watch at all.
Please do put The Intern on again. Even though Producer man said he wouldn't.
the season was good but now everyone has the attention span of a child and critiques every detail......
"Why did (insert unlikely event here) happen?".   "Unclear".   Moving right along ...
This was infinitely better than the show.
Can you Pitch Walt’s Peter Pan and it’s remake please?
oh my goodness, I had to stop the video during the Intern part because I was laughing too hard. As a custodian I wonder if I pay students in cream they will unclog the toilets at school...
Dude, Yes this was a perfect review with the intern bit.
**Shia LaBeouf Clapping Intensifies**
Where can i donate to you, but not on youtube, I won't give them anything.
I don’t know but every single Pitch Meeting ™️ nails it and delivers at such a high level. Even the Pitch Meetings on movies and shows that I love are great
This is every single Disney plus show ever made. They have absolutely no idea how to structure a tv show.
Ngl i am invested in intern guy cream quest
Bring back the intern 😂
Best episode of pitch meeting ever!!!!
Ryan must be moving up since he was able to hire three new actors for this pitch meeting :)
The Interndalorian
Stretching out plotpoints is tight!
I don’t even watch any of these shows anymore I just watch pitch meeting
Actually, Gideon should've removed Djarin's (ugh) helmet when he was captured
So...when are we going to explore Producer's Intern plotline? Maybe this was the pilot to the Intern Cinematic Universe, where Producer Intern and Writer Intern talk to other Interns?
Need more internship episodes
Time to make a spin off show about intern guy that no one asked for
I really liked side quest in this Pitch Meeting which is something I cannot say for Disney shows
You just keep getting better!
Wait. Is Intern going to get his own show next season?
This was VERY WELL WRITTEN.
Honestly, I could find a movie, think it was the best movie I'd ever seen, that had pulled tears from my cold heart, then come here, watch you dunk on it for almost 10 minutes, and still rattle the thumbs-up button, full of joy.  This was so so good!  Admittedly I was more invested in your Intern story than the sideplots in The Last of Us, and .. well, every other side quest.
Maybe it's just a 'disturbance in the force...' or maybe it's just me, but have you guys noticed how almost EVERY star wars show Disney produces is absolutely perfect for Pitch Meeting? :D It's like a frickin' dyad by this point :D
You have creativity to spare, it must be like an aura around you.
I loved season 3. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Quests for cream are tight!
That sidemission was top lel 😁
The only "Oh, really" in _Pitch Meeting_ history not preceded by "Super easy, barely an inconvenience".
Honestly episode 3 was my favorite. Felt very Andor
Disney had one of the best and Most watched Shows. And ruined it. Is this Kind a Sport for Them?
Stock footage of SUVs for several seconds is tight!!!
Did the intern ever get the turds?
but what about intern guy?
This season was practically designed for an epic Pitch Meeting.
The Intern Gag fell flat - thank goodness for fast-forward
I was kinda excited about the outdoors filming until I realized it was just stockage video.
I’d suggest Ryan does an Andor pitch meeting, but it would just involve Producer guy taking a back seat while Writer guy just slinks away from the studio and does his best work. And I pop in at the end and go “Wow, wow, wow….WOW”
I didn't watch Boba Fett and I was like wtf
-Can Pitch Meeting encapsulate all that is The Mandalorian season 3 in only one episode? -Actually it will be super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Side quests are tight!
I feel like a South Park pitch meeting would be fun to see
Season 3 was absolutely amazing ! If you think different you are not normal and defo not a true star wars fan !
Fucking nailed it!!!
Season 3 didn't have the same magic seasons 1 and 2 had. Mando and Grogu are still awesome, this season was just disappointing.
I didn't get it at first. Why is this annoying unrelated intern fetch quest scene going on for so long? Then I could stop laughing.
Are you not doing a pitch meeting for The Last of Us? I was really waiting for it, love this one though ❤
Nailed it. I thought I was the only one wondering why the main character wasn’t in his own show anymore. Disney is insane.
Star wars are usually the only pitches I skip, but gdmnt I'm glad I watched this for the side quest is a wild new level for you brother.  Wow.
Can't wait for intern guy's movie and grocery store guy's spinoff animated show
I WOULD'VE WAITED AN ETERNITY FOR THIS.
This is on another level just like with the previous mandalorian pitch meeting
OMG a side quest!? I love side quests. Side quests are tight.
“Wasn’t that this show?”  “Well, sometimes”  I guess TLOU is better at sticking to its key premise😂😂
I need a whole show where the intern relaxes in some sort of tank to unlock core memories for no reason
The Farce Is Female !
the sidequest was the best episode of the season.
Brilliant🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The meta humor just makes it that much more funny 😂
At this point they should just make a "Star Wars the TV series" as one big show instead of 15 smaller ones
"We're Disney watch everything we make or else"  😂
Pitch Meetings and Ryan George skits have finally crossed over.
This is why I watch pitch meeting.  Solid gold here.
Thank you for your service, you make bad content into good content.
You know, a villain only explaining their plan after it fails actually does make sense.  Good on you Disney.
Pulling random celebrity names out of a hat is my favorite gag from this episode
Ryan George, keeping it hilariously fresh while still providing expert lampooning
Great job, Ryan! Went for a kill this show deserved
My man just skipped the pirate episode because of how non-plot relevant it is
The "Intern side quest" was such a good storytelling way of show how to not do storytelling that it will be passed on from generation to generation for thousands of years.
It’s been very fascinating to use screen writer guy’s psychological tactics on my boss at work.    Boss: “why did we do that?” Me:  “so the work can happen” He moves on  Boss: “why did this go wrong?” Me:  “unclear” He moves on  Boss:  “why is this happening?” Me:  “because money” He is happy, moves on.  Basically my work relationship with my boss is pretty much screenwriter guy and producer guy, and it works quite well.  DISCLAIMER-before doing this at work you must be good at your job and likely more competent than your boss.  Also, do not attempt “I’m going to need you to get all the way off my back.”  This does not work under any circumstance.
Disney's Star Wars Writers are Bankrupt of Ideas...But Ryan George and Pitch Meeting is Never Bankrupt of Ideas
hee hee hee hee hee haw
"Star Wars bad guys love somehow returning"  Does that mean Rey is a bad guy?
This is my favorite episode you've ever done. Ever 😂😂😂
You stretched the episode despite having NO PLOT and people are now calling it a masterpiece, JUST like they do with the Disney SW Shows, what a genius.
Bravo Ryan 😂😂😂 👏 👏 👏
GodDAMN this was a good one!  F-ng brilliant, Ryan, thanks for sharing!
meh, i liked the season. enriches the world, set it up for a nice season 4 of bounty hunting again
I didn't really enjoy this season that much and your pitch meeting really crystallized why
when are we geting intern guy, other intern guy, & cashier Guy Youtooz?
#internspinoffshow
I was cooking dinner and literally dropped everything to follow the intern subplot.
wow this is fantastic
So....how high are the chances that the Intern will somehow become a new Fan Favorite? 😄
Perfection again
Oh, a side quest in a pitch meeting for a show that’s about side quests. Should’ve done the same thing in the pitch meeting for the first two seasons.😂
6:00:   Grogu is doing the cat thing of 'playing' with his food, isn't he? That poor frog.   🤢
The “he’s gunna do that after it already fails” part got me good
Best video yet!!!😂😂😂😂
"...and then there's gonna be this happy ending where Mando and Grogu are living in a little house together!"  "Oh, thats's nice"  "...and we end on a tight shot of Grogu torturing a space frog"  "Oh, that's...disturbing"
A master class in how to break the fourth wall without breaking the fourth wall.  Also in bringing a point home subtly.
Ahh....it's 2023 and I wonder if anyone will ever pitch the old Robocop. Crazy.
I thought the title of the show said the Mandalorian season 3 but I swear it’s Bo Katan season 1. Probably just a technical error by whomever put the show on Disney plus.
It had to be done
Just keep imagining all those cars filled with Ryans!😂 The whole city and universe!
pls never see him again 😂
I haven’t seen any of them mainly because I’m not easily amused by baby yoda 🙄 I know it’s not. I’m glad I’m missing it.
Okay, I can't tell if the music is derived from some Great Plains Pow wow or an episode of Kung Fu but I must say it is tight.
disney taking notes from anime isekais, only starting the actual story at the end of the season
The whole unnecessary intern side plot was genius! Seriously though this season of Mandalorian was sooo BAD!
The truth hurts but pitch meetings make it so much better.
Omg there are new characters
3:45 😂😂😂 6:46 😂😂😂
Ad-libbed endings are tight!
ngl, intern gag proved that Disney was right and shows they should keep doing what they're doing
It's just amazing to me, that after how many hundreds of pitch meetings and other skits, these are STILL so original and hilarious.
Wait…is Boy George and Ryan George related?
Star Wars villains LOVE "somehow" returning. XD I spit out my drink
Best Pitch Meeting yet
gave up on show ,what a load of crap
That intern sidequest sums up every Mando episode XD well done. Very funny and accurate
I will help unclog you toilet and I will accept turds as payment
Pitch Guy: So Then Grogu's Gonna Pilate IG-12 And Make Him Sound Like A Sex Robot Producer Guy: Ooooooh, Sounding Like A Sex Robot Is Tight
Can't wait for the Ahsoka show with Sabine being the main character
So so good, thanks ryan!!
The side quest is absolutely brilliant! It's so true that this show is just a side quest.
I'm really disappointed we didn't see the pivotal moment where intern guy actually receives the creamer.  I feel like it would have tied the whole segment down and really paid off the investment we put in on watching intern guy.
Nailed it!
Cynically convoluted in that special way only big corporate studios do so well.
Ryan George for Canadian Prime Minister.
Perfection.
INTERN!!!!!!!!!
Ya let’s scrap all the good ideas and plots and give the series to a clown like Kathleen Kennedy so she can destroy Star Wars like everything else she touches..  Star Wars is dead until they axe that lady. FYI I’d bet the house she’s never seen one Star Wars movie ever. Rant over lol
RELEASE THE InternCut #Interncut #cutofintern
"Don't worry about it, we never gonna see him again"   *After a lot of requests from the comments intern-guy will be back in his own show.
hi it’s me oscar from the oscar’s would intern like an award
Here at 112,337 views.
I was like what the hell is it with interns. But I got it we clicked on the video to see the pitch meeting, and is following the Side characters. It took me a second but I got it
Streeeeetcchh
2:43 and I'm wondering if that cream is still in the cow located in savannah Africa?  Because it looks that way.
best side quest ever. this is the way.
This is gold
This is perfect! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
10/10 Pitch Meeting.
Intern Guy and Fellow Intern Guy!!!!  They are no Sidequest, I want them to be recurring characters!!!!
A real-world footage?! It feels unnatural...  And also "may the studio be with you"
Probably the best one yet
I don’t think writers spend this much time actually thinking about plot anymore. Just barf out the first thing that pops into their heads and hand that in…
You know what I love about playing Mario Brothers? Taking control of Toad #5736 who’s entire job is harvesting and placing the mushrooms in the question blocks all over the levels. That really is a great feature in a MARIO BROTHERS game.
Better than anything Disney has done with Star Wars since Rogue One
Actual pitch meetings for streaming shows: it doesn’t need to be good, it just needs to be watched.
Grab bag lmao bruh 😂😂😂😂
But I digress.
I love how he inhales the coffee in 1 second after all that trouble
How hot was the coffee Producer Guy chugged?
Perfection
That side quest was epic. Also, that was the cleanest store toilet I've ever seen, especially for one that's been long clogged by poodoo 😀
What happened to the intern, Ryan? SHOW US MORE OF INTERN GUY, RYAN.
Lol main characters
The Intern Coffee Cream Side Quest was 10x more interesting than the Dr Pershing episode
Missed opportunity to have a snickers bar in the toilet lol
Time for an Intern spinoff series. The Book of Interns.
You leveled up with this one! It's going to be a hard act to follow.
I looked down for (what I thought was) a sec and looked up and was like, wait…what did I miss…?   Then I realized what you were doing. Brilliant! 😂
More Intern side quests please!!
When I heard “Don’t worry about it, we’re never gonna see him again” about Intern Guy, it was not very tight, super easy, nor barely an inconvenience.  Wow.
Heads will roll when Kathleen Kennedy learns footage of her preproduction meetings are getting leaked to YouTube.
Perfection. Subtle clever jokes are tight!
Pitch Meetings being infinitely more watchable than the rubbish they're lampooning is *tight*!
This was just too fucking perfect lmappoooo
Shots fired! Ouch. lol
Very good! :)
Wow.  That intern skit was amazing.  Great episode calling out the ridiculous season 3.   So funny thank you.
Was Ryan George associated with this? I love his 'Pitch Meeting' videos.
Side Quest
I dunno, I was really into the bizarre adventures of intern guy. I want more of that.
This is, without a doubt, the greatest Pitch Meeting episode so far.  Ryan woke up and chose violence (against Disney)
This episode only got a 33 fan rating on Rotten Tomatoes but don't worry the shills..errr critics gave it a 89%  yay Disney!!
I was hoping you would mention Ahmed Best also appearing in the show, but I enjoyed the intern side story. Tell me more about the intern!
If there's one thing I've learned from every science fiction story ever, it's that any time you have a room full of clone tanks, you're going to want a "destroy them all" button.
In Ryan's genial and hilarious way this might actually be the most scathing pitch meeting he's ever done.   ps I think I've been hypnotised by the rotating moustache work of Store Guy!
I bet if I had watched this season I would totally understand the intern gag… but you know what? It’s alright!
Pulling Lizzo and Jack Black out of a hat had me laughing so hard. Sheer genius and most likely a true story.
This just replaced Willy Wonka as my favorite Pitch Meeting. 😂
I just want to say Thank You.
Least you didn't go the Netflix route and add 20-45 minutes of emotional backstory for episode filler. Props on keeping the video at under 8 minutes.
If it was true to the story, side quest guy would have needed to get the plunger from someone else, but on the way his car gets broken.  Then he would have to get the part to fix it from someone else, but to get the part would require another mission.  And who does he meet in that other misson?  90s time traveling reporter Guy!  ( That's right, crossover!  )  Then, and the fighter episode, he can get the cream to producer guy.  The end.  (With a twist or a joke in the post credit scene)
Wowowowow wow. Stretching thin plot lines and spending too much time with hollow side characters is TIGHT.  Andor is leagues better than Mandolorian or any of the other Disney Star Wars shows.
Huh, if I had a nickel for every time Pedro Pascal got sidelined in the second portion of the third episode of a show where he is the lead, I’d have two nickels which isn’t a lot but it’s weird it happened twice, right?
5-View Crew, #2!! 💜🤠
i hope the inter comes back, he seem like a cool guy.
I don’t know what the numbers are nor do I know what Disney was expecting but in my opinion they are kinda shooting themselves in the foot. I love the Star Wars universe and I would give almost anything that comes out in that universe a chance but if they don’t start listening to what the majority of fans want then it’s almost like they sunk their own ship! This season felt all over the place to me. And the hole “the main character isn’t the main character for this episode or episodes” this was NEVER a good idea. And the hole thing with Bo getting the dark saber was the worst way to do it. Then the destroyed it (like there’s no way that it will come back……. Wink wink) and that just felt like they were ether trying to set up the tension for next season or they just like to piss off fans. Now that being said I did like a lot of the episodes even if some of them didn’t feel like the same story line and I loved the last episode. But if they want this show to have a lot more seasons they need to change something real quick. But if they just want to do 1 or 2 more seasons then there on the right path! I really hope they don’t mess up the Ashoka series!!! She’s by no means my favorite Jedi but I loved her in the clone wars, Rebels and her book.
😂 When he started driving to the store, I involuntarily let out a big exasperated sigh. Then laughed out loud when I realised I was so emotionally invested in a pitch meeting. 😮 Well played, sir.
We watched one season and then immediately canceled D+.  So glad we spent 0 seconds on this nonsense.
Best Mando video ever
Ryan forgot to mention/adress that the fact that Mando no longer being a mandalorian (and hence needing the bath), ALSO happened on the Boba Fett show. XD
holy shit, he's expanding the pitch meeting lore with coffee guys. Soon we're gonna have a whole pitch meeting cinamatic universe.
Ryan I get what you're trying to say,  but the point falls apart when your side characters are just as if not more entertaining 😂
That side quest bid was perfect 🤣
This is the best Pitch Meeting I've ever seen.
OMG this is so perfect LMAO
Oh man! The side quest is just killing me! 😂
"Watch everything we make or else"  I guess people started choosing "else", lol.
Point well made sir
this is the way
I'm pretty sure that one episode all about the side characters exist because of Andor. It showed that sometimes Star wars stories do good when they don't follow the main story. So they tried to aim for another world expanding episode
"Quest Meeting" 💰💰💰
Ryan, this episode is GENIUS 😂😂🤣
I though Din was going to take his helmet off in the last shot, I guess Pedro wasn't there at all this season.
Season 3 sssssuuuuuucked
Can we all petition to make Intern Guy a reoccurring character
I feel like theres a missed opportunity about the saving Nevarro to live there and then decide to leave to retake mandaloreimmedietely after
Seeing the shopkeepers mustache almost drop off is tight
Why did Ryan put a video showing an ant inside of a little HotWheels car?  I didn't get it.
That was the most aggressive Yeah Yeah Yeah ever
what made things more stark was season 3 of Picard it made Mandalorian season 3 that more worse
Took the intern longer to get to the store that it did for the republic ranger to get to the capital from the outer rim
You nail these EVERY. TIME. How do you do it?
I love how this one and season one's pitch meetings reflect the series by having a random side quest.
Brilliant!
1:27 : Yeah, especially when the show is literally named after the main character i think !
Surprised at the lack of mention about how the first episode is like five plots mashed together and nothing has actually happened by the end of it, but otherwise on point.
2:58  HEEEY!  How did his mustache get straightened out?  Did someone straighten it out for him?  Did he do it himself?  Was there a long quest in those few seconds that explains how his mustache got straightened?  _I NEED TO KNOW!_  ...no, I'm not yelling.  I just like capitalized WORDS that's all.  They're easier to READ when you're old and have glasses.
"We're Disney. Watch everything we make, or else." 😂😂😂
I love how it's always the Mandalorian episodes that get side quests.
Did anyone else actually enjoy watching the other characters stories in Mandolorian? I actually really liked getting to see what the New Republic was like seeing other parts of the galaxy.
The sequence break to get the cream really subverted my expectations.
I'm done hoping something good comes out of Disney Star Wars. This last season was unwatchable. There is no redemption, there is only Disney dumpster fires
Watching these pitch meetings are so easy, barely an inconvenience
The interns need their own show a la Lower Decks.
😂😂😂
1000% thought them destroying that batch of clones would reveal hundreds of others flying off on ships with real Moff Gideon as his clone “lost” to Mando.
Comedy timing is great on this one😂
Jon Favreau`s character getting killed by the praetorian guards was his way of telling us Kathleen Kennedy won, and that Star wars is dead.
No! Do not say we will never see Intern Guys again! How can the world be so cruel, to give just a taste and then, no more?
I didn't think it could get any better than the first Mandalorian pitch meeting. And yet somehow, it did.
Ever since you explained that you just do whatever in your endcard (I think you explained it in one of the "revisited" episodes) I've been loving sticking around to see whatever randomness is going on there this time😂
who else stopped at the car right to check how long this bit's gonna be? oh 7 min...all right then...
Love how the store owner is like a video game npc that just jumps to unloading baggage on the player after a second of conversation.
I appreciate you, thank you for making content.
Even the last 'wow' dragged a bit. Impresive character development
Tfw I had no clue Pedro wasn't on set for any of season 3. Why are people so hesitant to recast him again?
Best side quest ever, especially the over long landscape traveling scenes
I was ok with the detour in the show and I’m ok with it here 😂😂😂
Producer Guy really pays his intern well based on that SUV he's driving!
"Somehow moff Gideon returned" xaxaxaxa 😂
2:20 Canada looks weird here.
Disney starwars is dead to me.
The intern creamer side quest is pure gold.
Got 2 minutes in and had to like it! One of my favorite episodes by far!
Oh my goodness. I’m so happy he caught on how stupid and annoying it is to have a complete side quest that’s unrelated to anything at all to the main reasons I’m watching the show.
You know, it needed to be said. Glad PM is saying it.
If intern guy doesn't return we riot.
Jesus, he wasn't the star of one episode and its suddenly a "thing", even though there are hundreds of shows that give an episode to developing side characters or bad guy plots.
This is bo katan. It's her show now!🤣
Shocking that he didn’t address Greenbeard the space pirate…
The only payback for the emotional labor of watching a fetid, maggot-infested carcass of once-decent show slooooowly decompose over the course of 8 grueling weeks is the satisfaction of having all the references in the subsequent Pitch Meeting episode fully resonate.
Hold on luke skywalker and yoda is a baby or is the baby not yoda
Side quests that have nothing to do with the story are tight!
Best. Pitch. Meeting. EVER!!!!!
Amazing!! This one was really good again 😂
This seems to be personal! :)
Mildly disappointed there was no “the man with the DeLorean is in the Mandalorian” joke, but otherwise great pitch.
Bro, it took me so long to get that the intern part was making fun of the way Disney sideline their main characters and go right off the main plot 😂
"...and I should probably start scripting these.............but I"m not going to." is the through line for all Disney Star Wars content.
This was art
Wow, it's amazing to see the world outside of the office! It did feel kinda weird though
These are so good! So bloody funny. I want to send them to everyone I know.
That stock footage of cars driving 😂😂😂
Mmm this pitch meeting actually seemed planned out and had an engaging story that seemed to flow well from one point to another.... Unlike Mando season 3 the episodic show with goals that change with the date on the calander.
Loved your video,interacting to drive algorithm
Disney we were disappointed In mandalorian season 3. You changed the whole point of the show in baba fret. You are terrible story tellers!!
Man, Ryan really HATES Disney Star Wars, he ripped this season apart.
How does intern guy afford that nice SUV?
Thank you for this! I’m so glad that I don’t have to finish watching this slow motion train wreck of a season ~Trav
Intern jokes are TIGHT!
What I really want to know is, who clogged the toilet with the turds?  My guess is it was epic voice guy from honest trailers.
That's exactly how the show was. Amazing intern bit!
The music added to the side quest driving sequences was glorious! Haha.
This was great. I'm so confused though. How many interns work there? How big is the building? Why is the store so far? Is there a universe of Ryan George's? Did we enter into the multiverse? Am I also Ryan George? This video is wrinkling my brain.
I need more intern.
This is more entertaining and better paced as well as better written and acted than the multimillion dollar major motion picture studio's production of The Mandalorian. Ryan George is still the funniest man in America.
The jokes write himself
I had just watched the Critical Drinker's "wasting time" video on The Mandalorian Season 3 and then you pull off that intern gag... Perfection.👌
Side questing belongs in gaming
Disney: watch everything we make,  or else!  I choose to watch nothing from Disney anymore.
I hope we get to see more of that Intern-Guy.
That is the only explaination as to why Lizzo and Jack Black are randomly part of Star Wars now.
"Mando has to take a bath" ☠
😂
When I see this Pitch Meeting I feel this pitch happened the other way around
well that about sums it up yes
The car commercial insert - I’ve never laughed out loud at one before, this was a first. 😂😂😂
Production value going up! Didn't know you had the budget for so many more actors. You've made it.
Damn didn't wanna touch on the Mary Sue in the room huh
Wow.  Just wow.
I like when he say yeah yeah yeah 😅
Now do Picard season 3.😂
Great humor !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thanks, I hate it.
The intern stretching out  minuscule and indifferent plot points, while we are waiting for the actual Pitch Meeting to continue,  was ingenious.
Woahh... Woah... Hold on... There's an outside clip... Why are we outside... We don't go outside.. no no... We stay inside and you make the talking noises.... I'm afraid ... And I may have tinkled a bit.....😊. Another great video you must be Canadian or something...
that side quest was chef's kiss!
Omg I literally finished the Mandalorian and I was so confused in season 3😂 thanks for clearing that up
This was the best way to avoid watching Mando S3. I watched the first ep and saw Grogu then didn't bother watching another episode. I regret wasting my time watching the first 2 seasons since it was all for nothing anyway.
I wonder if they paid the intern for his little quest that made the Pitch Meeting Tight!
That intern side-quest was the perfect amount of obnoxious.
this is vaaaaaaaastly superior to season 3
This isn't just funny, it is a masterpiece of comedy. So many layers of jokes in the intern bit 😂
The intern scene was hilarious lol!
Now do Andor?
7 min Pitch Meeting is perfect for a Mando review.
Brilliant :)
Intern guy going on a long quest for creamer is a wonderful meta joke.
I liked it.  You are a genius.  You are funny.  Keep it up.  LOL  You rock dude.  :)
Omg when you said it this way yes this season was nasty garbage they even make me hated the green baby
Has there ever been a show that fell so hard, so fast than The Mandalorian?
They're... Multiplying....
funny as always.  i actually liked the side quest episode and the drawn out MMO feeling of the show.  not sure why it works for me, but it does.
When the pitch meeting is better than the show.
"We're really filling these up, sir, we will make it to eight" is just the best line for why you just can't take this show seriously. While other shows with actual plotlines have to condense and simplify to meet an 8-10 episode season limit you have the jokers over at Disney who take the most mundane events and stretch them out to infinity
I thought the second intern was going to betray the first intern when he came back. For reasons.
Love it. OMG scream. I just watched the 5th and 6th and tbh, idk why. It was terrible. Remind me of the time I got a hangover. That bottle of Advil came in handy. Anyway you should review the franchise Scream 🫡
Epic and so accurate!
1:17 Every transformer movie ever
You know its bad when baby yoda cant save it
Screenwriter Guy: "So, so what's the deal with your intern?"  Producer Guy: "Don't worry about him, we're never gonna see him again."  MANDALORIAN SEASON 3 IN A NUTSHELL. Set up with little to no pay-off. And much of it is at the very end when it's too late to even matter😭😂🤣
Somehow intern guy returned.
That was such a good movie, in the middle of the pitch meeting episode. :D
ok Ryan - this is YOUR OSCAR MOMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I sure do hope YouTube gives those things out ; )
Random driving montages are tight!
This side quest was super easy to watch, barely an inconvenience. Thanks Ryan for making me not buying a Disney plus subscription lol
Season 3 was so slow and drawn out that Ryan had to come up will original content for the pitch meeting.
The Intern Gag was the best jab you could take at Mando. That paired with your jab at Disney movies pushing the Main Characters to the background were peak burns. They really made it super easy to insult them, barely an inconvenience.
Loved this one. Especially the side quest the intern went on 😂
I love it when the Pitch Meeting is shorter and WAY BETTER than the actual content it’s covering so I get the cliff notes of this terrible show without actually having to watch it. Keep up the awesome work!!!
This is the way
I was waiting for him to say he was sponsored by TOY YODA or something.
LMAO 1:55
your side quest was better than the one in mandalorian, because at least it had something to do with the story
Awesome, simply frickin’ awesome.
He literally copied a whole episode of mando (lizzo episode)
I for one enjoyed the intern
Clever... The Ma'amdalorin isnt even in HIS Picht Meeting....😜😂
This is your most hilariously meta joke ever.  The side trip i just couldnt stop laughing at.
I need to see a lot more of the interns!!
That season was pretty bad indeed. God I dislike Gideon and was disappointed to see he was back.
I really hope the intern guy comes back!
😂
Looking forward to The Last of Us pitch 😊
This is so cool. I have been dying to see more of the Producerverse! Can’t wait to see more of the Interniverse!
Why would Moff Gideon have a button that destroys his cloneinators?
I liked it
Stock footage of road trips is tight!
*Writers:* so we're gonna go ahead and give Din Djarin and Grogu a nice little happy ending, complete with a solid house, the kid is playing out in the sun, and Din Djarin gets to just chill in a nice lawn chair. No angst whatsoever.  *Fans:* _visible confusion_
Going all out on jokes is Tight!
Holy shit this may have been my favorite pitch meeting. This was so on point. Laughing the entire time. Great job 👏!
By all accounts the Mando kid should have been eaten by the time the others got to him. I hate the amount of stupidity in season 3.
Did you just corpse at pulling the name out of the hat? Magnificent.
What a wonderful way to spank Disney for repeatedly breaking away from their main characters in ALL their shows.
Typical disney bait and switch. Mando was made a side character in his own show and a strong woman was made the the central character. Super feminist Disney at it again. Having Bo Katan save Mando twice in one episode is when I stopped watching the series. I will now not watch anything that has to do with Disney ever again.
Sometimes I wonder whatever happened to Intern Guy, but then most of the other times I don't wonder that at all.
I was upset when mandalorian did it. Why are you doing it? At least I can skip yours.
I still haven't seen the last three episodes of season 3. Once I heard about Jack Black and Lizzo, I checked out.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I stopped watching after mando was captured by the centipede robot.
I am fairly confident that this is exactly how it all went down to make this “show”. I’m just trying to figure out who’s Kathleen and who’s Jon
My favorite part is when Grogu said, "I am Groot," and then saved his family from the fire.
Season 3 of The Mandelorian felt like a Dragon Ball Z filler episode... but for the whole season, but even worse it still felt like there were filler episodes in the filler season. 😮‍💨
Not gonna lie, that side quest to get cream was very engaging.
Best pitch meeting ever! And you thought side quests weren’t good
He forgot to mention that skinny Pete cameo 😂
I'm so done with Disney shows, it took 3 strong recommendations for me to watch Andor
I have been waiting for this one
Those were NOT Montreal roads at all.
Made a lot of good points, but... IDGAF I absolutely loved Mandalorian season 3 *shrug*
Can't wait for the interns to get their own spin-off where the producer guys suddenly take over for a while!
Please release the alternate cut of Solo: A Star Wars Story. The one with the same title, but it mostly follows Darth Maul's story instead.
3:10 BARTER 34 [45]
If my store had such a scenic drive I'd be willing to go there more often!
Oh man this HAS to be good.  Edit: this channel has to have a recording device at Lucasfilms. No other explanation, it was barely an inconvenience.
This is so good lol
Side quest
I was like: "How did he make a 7 min video out of the lack of plot in season 3?" .... oh, ok
Tight
So Disney isn't in the entertainment business, more of the "bludgeon people with mediocrity until they just don't care enough to change the channel" business.
This was absolutely brilliant. Best Pitch Meeting yet.
Now that disney did make millions of the 45th star wars series maybe they focus on quality... ahsoka is my last hope although i dont really like the old version of her
That intern gag was so amazing!😂
This is the way no that’s the closest
Dang. Sure wish we got to see more of producer guy and screenwriter guy. I wanted him to talk about the pirates and the whole IG-11 thing.  But I suppose that was the point: we didn’t get to see what we watched the video for.
Alright.  This is the hardest I’ve laughed in a long time.
Best one yet! This was hilarious! I have spoken!
You're a genius Rayan, I hope you know that
i look forward to having a prequel to Mandalorian 30 years from now that sets up why moff gideon had a button that destroyed all his clones. and its going to be a much better show than the mandalorian.
Intern guy barely an inconvenience to get some creamer
This was amazing! Hope to see more intern guy
We now need a whole web series of intern guy’s side quests. Make it happen. 😂
This is art.
Will there ever be a Pitch Meeting for “Schindlers List”?
It’s a pitty the shop owner wasn’t Jack black. Would have been great.
One of your best videos yet! Also disney is garbage.
Ya gotta love the world building of the Ryanverse 👏
Having long side quests during a pitch meeting is TIGHT!! 🎉
Me: Okay, so not bad, they touched on all the bases, the only thing that wasn't mentioned was the Darksaber.  Executive: "Why, does something untoward happen there?"  Me: "Yeah, during Bo's final battle with Gideon, he crushes the Darksaber with - get this - one hand".  Executive: " Holy shit, he actually destroys it?! How, why, and what the hell?!"  Me: "Unclear, he just destroys it somehow, bends it right in half despite it being made of the purest beskar, and for no discernable reason whatsoever. All he says afterwards is something stupid about the Mandalorians being "nothing" without their "little trinkets". Then Bo tells him that they're still strong when they fight together and Mando comes back in and starts blasting him from behind."  Executive: "Holy shit, that's actually kind of cool!"  Me: "Yes, very cool."  Executive: "Now hold on, isn't the Darksaber an important Mandalorian symbol, not to mention that it's also the most popular weapon in the Star Wars franchise right now, making it highly profitable?"  Me: "Yes, all of the above".  Executive: " And didn't Gideon want it back?"  Me: "Yup".  Executive: " And now, all of a sudden he doesn't?"  Me: "Correct".  Executive: " Why, what happened there?"  Me: "Unclear, he just seems to have changed his mind off screen at some unknown point".  Executive: " I don't understand any of this".  Me: "That's okay sir we don't either".  Executive: " So why are we doing this?"  Me : " Because we can sir".  Executive: "But won't this piss off a lot of fans and lose us tons of money?"  Me: "Most likely it will sir. And we are already planning season 4 but they probably won't want to come back and watch it".  Executive: " I still don't understand any of this".
The goal of the bad guy explaining his plan was so the fans can link the events between movies (palpatine clone, Snoke, etc.) and tv shows (bad batch, etc.)
Mandalorian S3, a series written by 10 year olds for 5 year olds.
This isn't realistic because a white man at Disney is pitching ideas to another white man.
I laughed out loud for the entire intern ride there and back, excellent joke!
Thank you for continuing to save me from new Star Wars. Pitch Meeting is still the best way to watch some shows. Even if broken logic doesn’t ruin all of them. Suspension of Disbelief is Suspension of Thinking. Sometimes you have to enjoy the ride.
This was hilarious
oh, becoming a bouty hounter again after becoming a bounty hounter is TIGHT!
Oh wowowow, ow
That sh!tter was strangely clean for a sh!tter that's all clogged up with a$$ biscuits. I'm intrigued, as are most of the viewers, I'm sure.  Ryan, don't leave us hanging, please! We NEED TO KNOW why that porcelain turd gobbler was so shiny! BALLAD OF GO-FER INTERN PART 2!!!
i had to pause it i was laughing so hard. my abs and face hurt. ok back to the pitch meeting
The Mandalorian has enough side quests to make Todd Howard jealous.
I got bored during the intern side quest and paused the video. Point well made!
But the cream is essential to the coffee which is the key to taming the Mythosaur which is the central figure in the origin story of the Mandaloreans and is necessary to give legitimacy to Bo Katan because Moff Gideon broke the Dark Saber which is the one thing that unites Mandaloreans so without it Bo uses the coffee as fuel to power the forge and brings together the helmeted and helmetless chanting "For Mandalore!" and Din and Grogu live happily ever after somewhere not on Mandalore.
LMAO! I ADORE THIS EPISODE! I’m so glad that Ryan is breaking the formula with Pitch Meetings now and just doing whatever feels right. I love it so much and I’m so here for it!!
These are just brilliant...!!😂😂😂
To make the joke work, there better be an entire channel dedicated to the adventures of intern guy ..
Too soon!😭I'm still trying to recover from that awful season. But really, you absolutely nailed this one! The in-video pitch meeting side quest was perfection!
Definitely a more interesting story than the Mandalorian.
This video perfectly summed up why this season was so bad.
Going on a quest to get your producer guy cream is tight
This one was quite creative. Gj
i love how the first mandalorian pitch meeting also have a side quest (producer guy seeks medical help)
Can we ditch the celebrity hat and never...ever do that again?
Most immersive world ever.
As any regular Pitch Meeting lore fan, I'm going to praise the quality of the episode based on the amount of "information" we received.  Lots of information on the intern guy. Great episode.
this is freaking brilliant
I somehow like it better when he doesn't take the helmet off ever, we don't really need to see his face.
Sublime 👌
Side plots within a pitch about a season full of side plots is tight.
Mandalorian Beach camp meets One Million Years BC. Just no Raquel Welch. ☹
1:33 right, that's the reason they shouldn't be naming movies and shows like characters and instead name them like events... noobs
They actually made me disappointed to see Katie Sackhoff Disney ........ You monsters !!!!
That hat trick makes perfect sense for odd people showing up on the seasons.
Vote up if you want more intern-guy
Picking names out the hat 😭
What the
Intern side quest was epic
Love the name hat gag!
That was too real.
I'm 100% convinced this is exactly how days go by at Disney.
Loving the outro scripts, this one was funnier than usual! 😇
wait... how'd i get in this side quest for coffee cream?
lmao the best
It's almost like we were really there for the actual pitch meeting for season 3.
Another instance where I skipped the show, watched the Pitch Meeting, and feel thoroughly satisfied and entertained.
We are Disney, watch everything we do or else....awesome...hahahahahhaa
Season 3 was so terrible I stopped watching, but this seems to be more watchable lol
So, Disney...are you paying attention?
Really want more episodes with Intern-guy and his side quests
Somehow moff Gideon survived 😅
It's a shame I can only like this video once...
I'm starting to think like Ryan now, during the travel montage my brain said, "Hello, welcome to the store."   and thats exactly what he said  🤣
Why are we wasting time with intern guy's adven-ohhhhhhhhhhhhh, just like the tv show!
We need more intern side quests
Even for me, who still kinda enjoyed this Season, that was a deserved brutal burn. So when do we get more turd fixing intern?
😂 Nailed it (as usual), thanks again Ryan!
Pitch Meeting Hall of Fame entry right here.
You cut out Bo Katan completely.
Laughed out loud at the intern bit I wanted to hate it but I can’t
The sad and pointless, wandering pacing of these Disney Star Wars shows suddenly puts the stupid 1960s-70s live action Disney films like  The Gnome-Mobile and The Strongest Man in the World in a kinder light. Also we have learned, no matter how far down a company falls, there is always more bottom to find!
NAILED IT
Gave up after episode 2
At least the intern was still the main actor XD
Now they even made Jabba Black
I see what you did there. 😂
Great summary of my issues with the series.
Am I the only one who thought that the S3 was the best so far
Stopped watching Mando S3 as soon as baby yoda showed up. I didn’t watch boba fett and refuse to.
ACCURATE
Facts 😂
You are truly a mad genius. Side quests in yt vids making fun of sidequests are TIGHT!
RIP The Mandalorian.. RIP StarWars. Thanks to Kate Kennedy and the woke shit
These parodies are becoming more and more redundant. “The Star Wars Cinematic Universe” is a parody of itself at this point.
Love it. Nailed it Ryan ^^
Honestly I'd watch a whole season of Producer Guy's Intern before I watched The Mandalorian. Loved the Pitch Meeting thoguh!
Woa woa woa, you can't just introduce 3 new characters of the Ryan Georgeverse and say we'll never see them again, now I'm INVESTED! Give me more intern guy chronicles
Ryan 1 and 2 were wonderful! Ryan 3 took way too long… Genius! Ryan 4 was super easy; barely an inconvenience. 😂
*Ryan thinking to himself* I'm going to make the best pitch meeting episode ever, and it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience! I'll just introduce new characters and have them do a side quest and then never see them again! 😂😂😂
This entire season was created for Mando to sign some legal documents for adopting Grogu, that is it, nothing else changed. OH this is Disney, because nothing in Marvel has changed either that entire new chapter.  Just more crap to string people along.
missed a Joke with the Stormtroopers can fly now... sad :/
Season 3 of The Mandalorian features: The Bathalorian, the Fillerlorian and the BackSeatalorian.
It was when he got in the car that it dawned on me
More intern sidequests please
What the hell Ryan. You made the whole cream tangent so funny I choked on my drink!
Don't drink that coffee. He was willing to accept turds for payment for a reason!
The toilet part nearly killed me, the smell must've been awesomely awfull
The quality of this show has really gone down since Ryan left Screenrant..... Oh no, sorry. The quality of Screenrant has really gone down since Ryan left.   There, now I fixed it.
I love how your creativity is still shining brightly after all these years!
This was the most epic pitch meeting I've ever seen! I didn't know there were multiple producer guys! I thought it was one guy working several studios!
Bro where is the intern-guy spin off
WHAHAHAHAHHA! Thats exatcly what this show have been like - Dont worry about him we will never see him again  OMG I am crying!
Simply, brilliant.
This is one of the best pitch meetings so far. Nice work Ryan 👍
I swear if Mof Giddeon comes back in S4 I'll stop watching the show. I have spoken, this is the way.
Petition to make the intern guy's side quests a permanent thing in every pitch meeting. this is the way, maybe, probably.
I mentioned on Twitter and Facebook how episode 3 of this season really felt pointless after it aired, focusing on some characters no one cared about who'd previously had a combined 3 minutes of screen time. I was roundly shouted down for not knowing anything about storytelling because clearly that was all set up that was going to pay off by the end of the season and I'm a big dumb idiot for not seeing that. Then the end of the season rolled around and... there was no payoff.
I do like me some Mandalorian but this is spot on.
I still wonder how people still see this shows, I stopped watching Star wars 10 years ago
Now I want an entire show of Intern Guy!!
Disney just bought the rights to the intern spin off show. Except the intern is being replaced by a strong ethnic female.
It wouldn’t be a pitch meeting for the mandalorian if we didn’t go on some long side quest
"THIS IS NOT THE WAY".
The intern's side quest... I had to stop the video. I was laughing too much.
The whistle flute music killed me. I’m still alive though, don’t worry. I’m ok.
This pitch meeting is next level hilarious.. I can't stop laughing at the sidebar coffee run....
He could at least give Christopher Nolan credit for directing that side story with Intern Guy
We now need a spinoff series on Intern guy.
Yeah this one is right on point about how the womandalorian is going. If we are lucky season 3 is it .
I get it.  He is trying to side quests are EPIC!!!!!
i wish i could like a video twice. great episode!
I think this is the best pitch meeting you've done
The intern scene perfectly outlined one of the main problems  Well played
No I didn't care about the Intern stuff, you proved your point well
Brilliantly done Ryan.
That intern they went WAY further than it had to. AND I LOVED IT 😂😂😂
This episode was HUGE for the world building
the entire time in my mind there was jack black air trumpeting the mandolorian theme while lizzo twerks in the background and I don't know how I feel abut that
Ryan was brilliant four years ago.... and he just keeps rapidly getting better.   It's a little terrifying.   Bravo, sir, bravo!
Well this was a complete classic!
HIlarious! You absolutely skewered this season of Mando! 🤣🤣
The coffee story was so exciting.
I almost thought there was an unskippable ad for a moment.
Can't wait for the intern spinoff series.
Mr George, you Sir, are a comedic genius. Thank you 😂
I love the end tag because I truly feel like the opposite. I was excited to watch mando initially because there was mystery and cute bonding but they lost me for a while I only started watching again for the Jack black cameo then watched the second to last one because I was told by my brother that it was god tier. I was very dissapointed and I think I’ll be happy if I never watch another episode of it again
Executives - But our focus group said this would make sense to put grou back in the show for no reason and also just make the ending really lack luster Writers - but what about the story?  Executives - ehhhhh
Nice Hyundai 👍
would love to see the intern arc
Long side quests to the supermarket are tight!
That creamer skit summed up all seasons of this lame ass show.
Mandalorian broke the Ryanverse so bad
My Star Wars content is now this kind of Stuff... lol Disney failed us all..... Its over, We Lost
dont script the end
How much money did you spend on stock Getty/Pond5/Shutterstock car footage for that intern bit?
Gawd! I'm so glad Pedro Pascal has better things cooking now. Season 1 was so cool but then Disney remembered that it's Disney and fucked it all to hell.
Awww the ole fetch quest is tight! #YeahYeahYeah
You forgot to mention that big Mandalorian guy sacrifices himself just to be able to kill everybody and make the escape unnecessary
The 3rd season was definitely a downgrade in my opinion, but it was still enjoyable to me aside from the wasted hour on that weird side-villain in Episode 3. Wtf was the point of that? So she could be in one scene later for 30 seconds talking to Moff Gideon? Or are they setting her up as the big bad for Season 4?
This pitch meeting is tight!!! Anything Mandolorian is tight!!! ❤❤❤❤
I just want more disney series to get more pitch meetings. Because disney star wars is trash anyway
Perfectly summarized how Season 3 has 90% of filler bullshit. Man how the mighty have fallen.
Note: dissapointing To Disney
Reality immediately breaks when Ryan stops using green screen
"If the show won't give me plot to talk about, I'll make my own plot."
Jack Black and Lizzo kills me
I realized halfway through that there was a sidequest to a sidequest to a sidequest
Ryan George son of Boy George
I don't know how I made it this far in life without realizing I want to be an Tight producer guy.
Hah... They were asking for it.
You are a frigging genius
ah so producer guy musta had to go film the last of us pitch meeting in the middle of this pitch meeting hence the lack of producer guy in the episode
Remember when the Disney story focus group listed dinosaurs on the board of things for star wars, well I think we know whose responsible for the Mandalorians spending so much time at the beach.
God this show sucks. Everything disney makes is an utter failure
Now the interns must become regular show characters.  With office space jokes.  Nobody ever came up with a show about offices so this feels fresh.
that intern seems familiar somehow! Is he new here?
Random celebrity names out of the hat game got me! 🤣
The celebrity hat XD I love this channel
Could someone explain to me why moff didn't stop the duo when he knew exactly where they were in that base?? Literally had them on a screen and him walking off to fight but they were able to kill all his clones?? Looks like he let them!
This pitch meeting was on another level... the way screenwriter guy picks random celebrity names is simply perfect, amazing work Ryan!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😂
Come for the Pitch Meeting.... Stay for the Intern's Adventure to get Coffee!
Unclear
The fact that you can make me watch until the very end with your subscribe piece just shows how much you care about making me wanting to subscribe to your channel even already being subscribe to the channel
Genius.
Hollywood = Evil!!! Hollywood and Celebritys = İlluminati's Puppets!!! In Hollywood, many stars use Adrenochrome!!! Mel Gibson has spoken directly on the subject: I don’t know how to break it to you gently.…  Hollywood is institutionalized pedophilia. They are using and abusing kids. They churn through a huge amount of kids every year.  Their spiritual beliefs, if you can call them that, direct them to harvest the energy of the kids.  They feast on this stuff and they thrive on it. What do I mean? This isn’t some kind of artistic abstraction.  They harvest the blood of children. They eat their flesh.  They believe this gives them life force. If the child was suffering in body and psyche before it died, they believe this gives them extra life force. There is a creative and loving force inside most of us that guides us through life.  These people don’t have this. For them it’s the opposite. Hollywood is drenched in the blood of innocent children.  For a long time all the references to pedophilia and cannibalism were symbolic or allusive.  But I was personally introduced to the practice in the early 2000s. I can talk about this now because these people, the execs, they’re dead now. The blood of a sexually abused infant is considered highly ‘enriched’ and is highly prized!!!
those turds were surprisingly clean, to be honest...
Is this becoming a Fandom Menace channel?
The music during the intern scene is the best. ❤
Can't wait to hear more about Intern Guy #1.
The stock photos of the car by the sea 🤌
joke's on ryan. that side episode was better than the episode. I want coffee too
The long and pointless scene of the intern going to the store referencing the Mandalorian's abuse of these type of scenes just to strecth each episode...this is the way
Need more cream. "This is the whey".
I like the part when he goes *"It's super easy, barely an inconvenience."* He should say that more often.
The funniest and snarkiest videos on YouTube! I love 'em!
😄😄😄😄 The intern bit was amazing!
Oh good, I can cross this one off my watch list 😊
There are times where I wonder if I should try to give Disney Star Wars some other chances despite the Sequel Trilogy, but then I come across insightful videos like this and I go....nah, not worth it.
Side quests are tight!
Damn that intern really went the distance, what a guy
Solid long form joke man. So good.
Hey man I clicked on the video to see producer guy and writer guy, not these two intern guys.
Please tell me that The Intern will get a spin-off series?  I need to know more about the day to day life of The Producer Guy's Intern.  I need a whole Ryan Cinematic Universe.
When I read really serious books I imagine them being narrated by writer guy. My book on The Second World War is less grim that way.
This entire season felt slow and uninteresting. It felt like nothing but *Filler* episodes. If S4 is anything like S3 I’ll be done with Star Wars until the next movie. Idk probably not even going to watch that either. Ahsoka will be filler stuff for Thrawns movie so I’ll probably not watch those episodes. Maybe I’m just *BURNT OUT* on Star Wars just like I am on *Super Hero* stuff.
Excellent way of explaining the confusion of sidelining a main character in his own show. 😄
Love it!! 🤣
Weird place to hangout 😂😂
Why are we leaving the office, we never leave the office
0:05  people are already confused from the end of season 2
Wait, hold up! Why does office guy #1 look like office guy #2? And the two intern guys looking all the same as well? Wtf is going on here?
Man Dough.
That intern guy story music was pretty dope sir.
I remember when they made shows that lasted for 20+ episodes full of good story and character development.
I see what you Did there!😂
👀 what you did there, in the intern super eazy 1:40
This pitch meeting just raised the bar
perfect
And so then a squadron of TIE interceptors and bombers show up on Mandalore, follow Bo-Katan back to her place and destroy her home. So she then tells all the Mandalorian tribes and the X-wing guy that there is a huge Empire presence around Mandalore? Nope! Ok.
Ryan wrote this entire script just so he could write a plunger off as a business expense
The one thing you got wrong was that the Mandalorians DID send people to check whether Mandalore was safe yet, but due to the bombing the atmosphere now jams scanners so you can't scan from orbit, you have to land. And every Mando that landed must have gone underground to look for the lake at the mines and died to that droid thingie. So after so many Mandos not coming back, the place was assumed to be toxic. Obviously one person must've only gone to the surface and not gone underground, so that person lived to tell the tale and brought back that piece of glass that convinced Djarin that the surface must be OK.
Hoping to one day be a producer guy is TIGHT.
The Intern Guy's trip seems to take him through South Africa, South Korea, Japan and New Zealand?
"I will accept cream as payment." Thats not much better.
That intern skit was so good lol
and you didn't even mention the darksaber plotline... what a waste of time that was
Lol perfect 😂
As to The Cream side quest . . . This Is The Whey. 🤓
Disney's ability to take even weak storytelling that was supported by charm & novelty, entirely strip away the charm, & repeatedly bash the novelty into utter tedium is quite impressive.  It's almost like they have imbeciles helming their productions, providing awful ideas, & if they happen across a decent one, steering them in exactly the opposite direction of what had been working...
Collab  Super easy no alcohol required   Just saying
Intern arc was still better than the entire first half of Mando season 3
House of the Dragon please!
"Star Wars:   The Quest For Cream" coming to Disney+ this July.
It's so cute watching a pointy-eared booger become a knight and apprentice.
Those interns look a lil familiar . . .
I’m just wondering if he’s going to do Andor. Maybe he’s just waiting for season 2 like the rest of us?
This was the wrong episode of Pitch Meeting to watch for the first time while super baked.
Don’t forget how they built up that Mando was going to be the cool reluctant leader of the Mandalorians and then they just casually said “naw let’s just have him casually give the dark saber back to Bo Katan and make her the main character” to kick start their own series.
3:30 Producer Guy: "This tastes like toilet."
took me a while, but i see what you did there XD
So fantastic, I didn't even mind the bit of punch-pulling you did.  Still, though...more comedy when you don't pull them.
S3 was dogshit
This is so good!
Drawing celebrity names out of a hat is tight.
Man in the middle of that intern gag when they went to the shot of the wide open space and the car driving down I thought it was another vrbo ad
Is this really what Season 3 is like? because my interest sort of died out with these shows and movies after Book of Boba Fett and Rise of Skywalker lol
Kind of surprised that there was no mention of Grogu’s new mech suit in this video.
SO funny!
#Bring back Intern Guy!
Pitch Meetings are Tight!
LOL the bo katan show
I can always trust Ryan to critique movies and series with legit points and comedy! I don’t know how anyone could defend S3, it went downhill real quick! The writing didn’t even need to be as complex as Andor but it should have met some expectations!
Where Louie?!?🐶🫶
Wow, Star Wars bad guys LOVE somehow returning!
This was brilliant.
We will know if Disney truly hates its fans if they give us a full length episode to follow fish Romeo and Juliet.
Taking a joke and elevating it to an art form.
hilarious !
Now I want to see Intern Guy suddenly appear in a First Guy To Ever video and take that over!
The B-Plot works best when it supports and adds to the A-Plot but the major problem is that the A-Plot isn't around and only shows up when it feels like it.
No one could it better. Love your Disney rags. I hope you live forever.
Don’t you think it was a little too easy for them to take back Mandalore? “Too easy? Paz Vizsla died!”  And who was that? “He was the big, angry Mandalorian with the Gatling laser gun who was related to other important Mandalorian characters.” Was there anything about him to endear him to the audience other than his last name? “Of course!…” Oh like what? “Well…he liked calling people Apostates…and he had a son.”
Best episode ever.
You're best episode so far !
I’d love to see a spinoff series about that intern
I thought I ventured into a car commercial for a moment there.
Thanks for the distracting Ryan Side Quest to get cream. I thought we were watching a Pitch meeting episode.  :P
I thought you'd mention the limited jetpack range when chasing bigbird but then the limitless jetpack range when dude flys to space.
Brilliant example of their bs.
Curious how many people pirated this show. I know I did
Well… we know how Ryan felt about this season…
Disappointed that intern guy got the creamer so easily.  Barely an inconvenience.
That side quest the intern went on is just like any game that forces you to do a task just to get something you need for the main quest
Yeah, this season was pretty awful.
Tabarnak Ryan 🤣
I would like to see the intern... Again.
This video made me realise that we didn't see Pedro's face in Mando S3!! Mad.
This is hands down THE BEST one I've seen!! BRAVO 👏👏
Oooooh my frickin gosh, how does he make stupid useless side things more relevant and FAR more entertaining than many-many-million dollar shows?  ...WHILE making fun of those shows?!
Ryan felt really, really mad at Disney this time!
The expansion of the Ryanverse
Absolutely my favorite EVER!
"maybe we should make the main characters of the show the main characters of the show' so f'ing true
The intern tales are more entertaining that this garbage Mando season lol 😂
This series continues to be one of the best on YouTube.
Ok, I wasn’t digging the side quest at first, but then the long coastline drive roped me in! Hilarious!!!
That was absolutely hillarious
The Boba Fett series was actually quite cool.  Absolutely nothing to do with the co-star super hot lady whatsoever.  Whoops, please nobody internet police me for that clearly sexist comment.
I was dying throughout intern guy's sidequest, good job Ryan
omfg the sidequest so fking good I love you
I like how Ryan even uses green screen for things he could easily just shoot in a real location.
I love the way you illustrated the theme by making your own stupid slow excursion. Very meta!
If Disney wants more people to watch they need to hire some real writers.
The side quest to really drag it out, this was the way. 😆🙄 so force clones like palpitations thingie.  Glad that's cleared up. 😮
😂😂😂😂😂
I was kinda hoping the assistant would find a mythosaur in that toilet.
The best pitch meeting yet!
The intern subplot was more interesting than season 3 of the Mandalorian
😂😂😂😂 brilliant
You now have to make intern guy season 1
That was a fantastic way to poke fun at show side quests!
There's two interns working for producer guys. Where is the second producer guy? Does the pitch guy pitch to both producers, or is there other pitch guys too? I have so many questions.
I'm so far behind.
if new age star wars has taught me one things it's that the best weapon is throwing a space ship at something
so good!
Something about that music, intern and car travel really cracked me up. And cracking up is indeed very tight.
I love when Pitch Meeting stems away from the actual Pitch in favor of Producer Guy's Dollar Sign Eyes, and now Intern Guy getting Producer Guy Coffee. I'm beginning to notice a pattern here. Perhaps all Mandalorian Pitch Meetings will take a break from the Pitch for random shit! 😂
please do a simpsons pitch meeting
Please do the Blade trilogy!!
Great script.
Stop it. STOP IT! The side plot hurt my head. That is exactly how it felt while watching the Mandalorian
INTERN GUY, INTERN GUY!!!!!!
Fucking A++++++
I REQUIRE MORE INTERN GUY
How Disney writes shows and movies these days:  Throw plot points in a blender and then puke into it.   Mix thoroughly into an incomprehensible mess, then pour all over the TV screen.
I'm looking foward to see in a couple of years the pitch of ...somehow Rey Palpatine returned.
Cancelling your Disney+ account and missing Pedro Pascal's body double go through a video game plot is super easy, barely an inconvenience.  Also, the intern's car appeared to be on fire, somebody should look into that.
Sidequest
Genius
"Okay, okay, I'll tell you what - no."
Casual Palpatine refference is tight
The pterodactyl episode itself was worth a whole Pitch Meeting. You didn't even mention Grogu using the carcass of a sentient being as its personal toy.. how cute!
The way you made fun of episode 3 and how this season didn’t focus on Din like it should have.
I was glad the side-quest wasn't us having to watch the producer take a bath for 3 hours.
Great, now we gotta watch for Intern Guy's YT channel to make sure we don't miss any important plot points.
I love how Ryan made no mention of the pirates at all so they have as much impact on this video as they did in the show
Are people finally realizing how trash this show is?
Pure genius! I love it
Disney: Watch everything we make or else!
Amazing
Intern guy used the wrong tool for unclogging a toilet; you should use a double-belled plunger. The single-belled plunger he used is for unclogging sinks.
yeah, other than 2 episodes, this season was VERY lackluster :(. here's hoping season 4 is as good as the first 2 seasons.
1st season was pretty good, 2nd season was ok, 3rd season is a turd.
Don't worry, Producer Guy! I am hooked on Star Wars for life!
So spot on!
The big round eyes in the thumbnail Mando helmet actually looks like a cool design for a real SW helmet 🤔
Not watching a season because the quality was already noticeably lower in episode one, but then watching the pitch meeting is tight!
I'm already subscribed to Grocery Store Guy's channel, and looking forward to many great adventures with him and those that wander into his store.
Got a trial for Disney Plus and tried watching Mando but couldn't for this reason. Great  acting and the show looks fantastic but it felt like watching a bunch of fetch quests which I thought was the main complaint of Rise of Skywalker. And or was fire though. 😂
The whole season was a boring slog. Very disappointing and doesn't bode well for other new ones coming up by this crew. Give me more Andor, though, please!!!
Or else
Aren't they in an office building in a city? Why go out on a country road to some random shop just for cream?
You should to a pitch meeting for Psych
I thought the pacing of the plot was downright Peter Jackson's "The Hobbit". But damn, those mass fight scenes in the atmosphere were stunning. The bird thing and then those pirates. If only the story had been thought through and told, as well as the bells and whistles stuff. Then again, I guess that is the state of Disney TV (and most movies) these days: Stunningly visualized mediocrity.
BRILLIANT!!
This was one a good one, kinda ironic that the worse the movie or show the better the Pitch Meetings.
"WATCH EVERYTHING WE MAKE OR ELSE!" - Ryan George and also Ryan George
The random hat was hilarious!
If Din isn't the main character anymore, shouldn't they out an S on the end to insinuate that they're all mandolorians?
2:27 You know they stayed with that shot for so long on purpose! 😂
I would watch this all day long rather than have to watch Disney starwars!
The Ryanverse keeps on expanding now waiting for the movie 🍿:)
Brilliant! While I loved this season, I could see some flaws. I get why some folks hated things. This pitch meeting was TIGHT!
How can you expect us to be invested in intern’s story without a little cute merchandising opportunity tagging along?
"Oh, Star Wars bad guys love somehow returning!!" That got me man 🤣. Would love to see Jabba the Hutt somehow return.
Favaro: Hey, I created a Star Wars thing people actually like! Kennedy: Hold my blue milk.
This video was actually better than the entire season 3 fiasco, and likely 1/2 the budget!
The coffee was cold and Ryan fired him:(
sidequest unlocked
4:57 "It's gonna be hard. . ." is always the key to chime in with "Actually it's gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience." "Oh, really." 😁
random creamer fetch quest is tight!
I feel like watching this was more rewarding than watching the Mando 3.  I'll never know for sure though.
Why is anyone even contributing to Disney's insanity, anymore?
I was wondering why is this 7min... But we have to get that cream for producer guy
I watched all of Mando III but I did not enjoy it. This is the way.
Nobody pays ME in gum.. I mean, turds- I mean.. creamer. Nobody pays ME in creamer..
2:28 “Hi there, hello there, I’m the Adstronaut, I’m out here in ad space!”
I am disappointed in myself that I am disappointed that Intern #1 is never coming back
I see what you did there… 😂😂
You and the critical drinker know how to take star wars down my God I wasted 8 weeks on that show
Was kind of hoping the interns would say "super easy, barely an inconvenience"
6:57  They should, probably, have scripted the entire season.
seriously man, disney needs to fire Kathleen kennedy and give star wars back to the people who know how to make star wars. I get disney is upset that star wars is a boys club, but you dont see guys going around demanding every romcom released should have action scenes and be incredibly sexual to get the male audience.
wait there was a third season
Not being the main character in my own show... is tight
My fav pitch meeting ever!
I have never laughed so hard. Not even finished the video yet. Well done, sir.
Focusing super hard on people we're never gonna see is tight!
The sad thing is the sidequest episode was one of the better ones, because the characters at least had a clear motivation and goal. The entire problem with the main bit of the season is that Mando just doesn't have anything to do, not really anyway, nothing that is compelling and meaningful.
I can't wait for this channel to fully convert over to an Intern spinoff
nailed it
Side quests are tight...
Genius
Really shows the expansiveness of this universe and intricacies of all characters
Thanks to you i never started Disney+ 😅  Thanks for the saved money 🤑
This pitch meeting is much better than season 3.
Accurate
Brilliant stuff!! Glad you’re doing what you’re doing for us. Laughter is crucial nowadays!
ye ye ye
this was the last straw. disney is just the worst. R.I.P. Star Wars
Overly long bits are tight
Somehow, moff gideon has returned lol
someday we will get a Hutt Mandalorian, they just have to get desperate enough
Was him going to the store just a bunch of Volvo commercial footage strung together with background music?
best gag since gagging
Wait… they said that thing from that other Star Wars thing…
Oh getting producers coffee is tight
Just awesome Ryan!
I don't know why but I need more side plots
Lucas: My Franchise might be costly but it’ll be really hard to lose the audience, I wrote trade and senate legislation as a background to a bad romance and it only grew.  Disney: Nah it’ll be a super easy, barely an inconvenience.
This pitch meeting was better than the entire season 3
That…made me even more cool with them doing it honestly, was not expecting that 😅
Why is Mandalorian still running💀
We need a pitch meeting for the movie "Pineapple Express".
Jack Black and Lizzo. Just when you thought Disney couldn't possibly go any lower…
I wish we would have spent more time on the unclogging... 😥
Please do "Nobody" next.
This was so good  Can we have Picard season 3 at some point as well?
Man I can't wait to watch the spin off series Intern: A Pitch Meeting Story where they spend a few episodes resolving Producer guys character arc.
New assistant is tight!
I always thought Disney pulled their ideas out of somewhere else 😉
*Making a pitch meeting for the Amazon show "The Boys" is super easy, barely an inconvenience. You should do it.*
Youtube MUST implement multiple thumb's up! When we cut to the breakroom I began frantically pounding that "like button" but it only ever recorded a single thumb's up.
Superb.
Haven’t watched anything Star Bores since Ray took over
Loved it! But it's time for The last of us!!!
I need intern guy to be a show
That intern lower decks episode was far more interesting than the Pershing episode.
Doing side quests, while doing side quests IS TIGHT!!!
1 guy: for the teaser poster let's add boba Fett helmet to add to the excitement. 2 guy: oh so he is going to be in it 1 guy: not even for 1 second, it just gonna be a random background character 2 guy: should we really put boba fett helmets on the poster with the exact helmet detail just so it's not him, but instead a background character? 1 guy: yes , also shut up 2 guy: oh okay.
Starship Troopers next please!
I was not expecting this level of brilliance. Bravo...bravo.
Hey! I didn't click on this video about the mandalorian to watch a video about your interns!!!
Okay, but when is the new season of "the producer guy's intern" gonna drop?
Can you make one for halo!!!!
Ryan George is a genius!
Mando with WIDE EYES is Very frightening
lmao, the intern side quest!
Star Wars died as soon as Disney bought the rights to it.
You know it's going to be a banger pitch meeting when it's over 7 minutes.
This pitch meeting is the way
a most compelling side quest
Guys, they did it, even the Mandalorian is bad now
Man, Ryanworld has become so deep and mysterious
Wait dose this skit set up exist in the first person universe where the naming company exists? That us now my head cannon just a bunch of Ryan's naming things and making movies!
Love the side quest 😂😂😂
the meta plot is too good.
Pitch Meeting turned into Sidequest turned into car commercial?! Wowowow! Unprompted product placement is TIGHT!
I was more emotionally invested in intern guy's side story than the entire S3 of Mando
Meta comedy is peak comedy
Coffee Cream Quest was 1000x better than this entire season of Mando.
Ryan was really in shade mode with this one 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Missed a solid opportunity to say "It is isn't it" like how he did "It did, didn't it" from the star wars skit from a while back.
It's a ridiculous series, but I love how even the kids have to wear helmets. I guess they have to learn how to cut their own hair, since they can never take the helmets off.
When does Intern Guy get his own show? He could do side quests with Other Intern Guy! Riveting!
Disney's star wars is dead lol
Oh.  The riff on the side-quests was brilliant.
It took me a few seconds to understand the sidequest gag, lol.
I can't believe that intern drove all the way from Hollywood to Montreal just to get some creamer.
The addition of side characters and quest was next level. Blend in some naming guys for crossovers!
"There is no way people get disinterested in these" Also me, before watching The Last Jedi... Then I got disinterested.
Dissapponted you didn't mention the dark saber, good video though.
As a Mando fan I thought Intern guys story was way to short. We need at least a 5 episode back story to how mustache guys toilet got clogged. Then gets the wrong kind of cream so we could have another quest and stretch it even thinner.
I can't wait for the intern origin story spin-off series i really want to know how he got that orange tie
Please do an Interstellar pitch meeting!
Does everyone remember when George Lucas filmed an episode of the Skywalker saga that didn't have any actual Skywalkers in it? Neither do I.
Omg it's the fabled pitch meetings lore!!
The moustache almost falling off the clerk had me rolling......
I love season 3 i just dont like the coruscant episode
I did like this Pitch Meeting I watched, done by you, Ryan George.
Disney sucks, so glad you made this
Why do I feel like this was the actual pitch for this season 😂
Very funny pitch meeting but it doesn't even nearly come close to how utterly stupid all Disney Star Wars TV show really are.
Soooooooo on point!
I love your methods.❤😂😂😂. The side quests had me in stitches
Ah if only I had a $ for every person who comes in the store just to use the bathroom . . .  hang one, Iv got an idea,  reinvention of the pay toilet - ta da.
KISS needs to show up as Sith Lords at some point. Knights In Sideous' Service
this feels like an april fools joke
Bravo
Pitch meeting just went up a level
Please complete back to the future pitches
Is that all stock footage of driving or...?
I’m watching this instead of the actual show
I should probly start Scripting thise....end things....But I'm not going to.
Implausible side quests are TIGHT!! This Is The Way.
So what's the intern's origin story? Where did he get that tie? How did he learn to unblock toilets?
Would have been fantastic if the convenience store clerk was Jack Black for some reason.
I have never laughed so hard at awhat I assume is a  jeep Cherokee commercial. Twice.
"It's a very important bath. So that's like two episodes, and then there's a third episode where he tells the other Mandalorians that he did, in fact, take a bath."  Sounds like every anime I've ever watched. 2 episodes to wind up a punch, 1 episode just to punch the guy, and another episode talking about how he punched the guy.
I assumed I forgot something. Turns out they never showed it.
When can we get “The Book of The Intern”?
Hmmmmm so what's meta here? Do I upvote... or do I downvote!?
That was the best Pitch Meeting yet! I was laughing my @$$ off! Sad how Disney has so ruined and destroyed Star Wars.
Pedro Pascal actually was in the suit for some of this season. He didn't remove his helmet because it would ruin the entire point of the first three episodes.
Star Wars: Fetch Quest
The Lower Decks of the Pitch Meeting universe :D
So off the rails that creator can’t keep track of the timeline
The way Producer Guy says "wow" and "oh no!" is just so genuine - like he's already engrossed in the show
This was so spot on.
Legend
i watched half this video, then completed a side quest, then resumed watching. i dont know why.
Oh Disney, how far you have fallen. I miss Ginnaaaaa
A amazing pitch meeting
Disney has an amazing ability to start a franchise with dominating potential... and then kill it.
You captured the essence of The Mandalorian perfectly! The only thing this pitch meeting is missing is random baby noises
😂 The Mandalorian has been nothing but side quests and monsters of the day since chapter one; so glad it gets called out.
wow it looks like the quality of the show really took a dive. I haven’t seen this season yet, but now I definitely won’t, the pandering celebrity cameos look so cheap and cringe, especially the hippo-cow-pig hybrid creature who just had to be shoved in there, I’m amazed she’s still alive under all that fat lmao  and hey, at least people are now realizing how random sidequesty all of the mandalorian has always been, Ryan’s gag was SPOT ON
Reminds me of Restaurant at the End of the Universe in which a ship captain takes a 300-year bath. 🛁
🔭🏴‍☠
The side quest ended me 👻
Intern guy is my new favorite character!
The on-location filming budget must have been through the roof for this episode.
I swear this is the funniest station on YouTube
Thanks for the synopsis saves me having to watch this season.
Oh, spot on. The quality of ammo Disney keeps giving to Pitch Meeting by screwing up their shows is ... wow.  I have a fleeting suspicion at this point that disney screenwriters do that because they're secret fans of Ryan's roasts
Getting the cream was not super easy and it really was an inconvenience❤😂
Mando Season 3 was absolutely awful. Such a letdown.
Please please do Armageddon soon…its oil drillers, in space…there’s sooo much material to work with here.
LOL
If you dramatically got off the car, it would have been more accurate.   Mandalorians sure love to walk down ship ramps all the time. 😆
I miss intern guy already. He was an amazing character. I hope he gets thoughts turds he wanted.
Watching the Pitch Meeting instead of the actual TV show is TIGHT!
Oh a pitch meeting of the Bokatan Show?!
omg sidequest time....
Star wars is dead.  But the parody making fun of it is alive and well.
This…is…the…zzzzzz.
The journey for the cream thingy was long and arduous
They just keep getting better, Ryan!😅
damn that music made me utterly entranced with intern guy's quest for cream
Love the intern gag here😂 Disney just can’t stop making main characters become side characters in their own shows/movies
I legit thought I missed something in season two. I assumed with the bath it would have gone:  We enter with some talking about how mandor is a poisoned planet filled with radiation and poison and ynbreathable atmosphere.   But no one knows where it is!  Right so mandor is going to have to take a bath in the water at the bottom of an endless mineshaft in that planet.  Won't that be hard?  Nope. It's going to be super easy. Barely an inconvenience.  Oh really?  Yea, see they were lying. Also, the mine is extremely easy to navigate.  Oh, easily navigable mines to move the plot forward are tight.
The reason why the store was having so much trouble unclogging the toilet is because they were using a sink plunger instead of a toilet plunger.  You want a accordion or flange plunger for toilets.
"All Hail Intern Guy" 🙌🙌
I really hope they don't make more mandalorian, because it ended in a really great place. Disney won't, of course, because money.
We need a whole other channel with the Interns.
Intern Guy spinoff series plz
This video was an excellent reminder to cancel my DisneyPlus subscription. Thanks, producer guy and screenwriter guy!
Why would he take his helmet off at the end after becoming a Mandolorian again? Grogu is a living being he'd be breaking the creed again. Did i miss something?
This pitch meeting makes sitting through that poor excuse of a mandalorian season worth it
I need a Ryan George interns sitcom
"Watch everything or else" is *very* much also MCU.
😎
They should of had Deepfaked or CGIed pedros face or something... At least we would be bashing on another shit thing the show had
I  DID NOT expect the side quest episode. I absolutely loved it! Especially the stretched out travel scene. Ryan does not disappoint.
It took a few seconds for the intern joke to kick in for me!! My cousin and I both said, didn't anyone ever check to see if the planet was okay???
LOL
Woah, they can afford an intern??? SIGN ME UP🤣🤣🤣
A sickening show made for retarded children is the best way to describe this TV series. It feels like being skull-f**ked by Disney executives even before the credits have finished. I honestly can't tell why anyone would watch such garbage.
I think there are more people worried about people who didn't watch The Book of Boba Fett than people who didn't watch the Book of Boba Fett
The intern quest part is pure gold.
Lol this became the video  “if real life was like video game main quests and side quests” for a few mins 😝
The pulling names out of the hat bit killed me.
Bizar to realise the sudden expanse of their universe by ...  a lot². What's next? A trilogy?
I honestly don't watch half of the things you do a pitch meeting for but I watch all the pitch meetings because they're still funny... Never seen the show but that coffee intern scene was hilarious.
You just threw shade with one joke lasting a full 2 minutes and 7 seconds… …tight!
The side quest was comedy gold.
Intern Guy spinoff season when??
I thought the intern gag is a car commercial , 😂, but no it’s not a commercial, some car brand should sponsor this.
The production 😂😂😂
Ryan's done hundreds of videos full of hilarious jokes and gags - things that actually involved writing and delivering lines and performing. It would almost be sad to say that footage of a vehicle driving along a country road was the funniest thing in any of these ever. But "Quest for Cream" was the funniest thing ever... in a different sort of way. Maybe it was the caffeine from the coffee I'd been drinking but just watching that vehicle driving made my brain vibrate from having it's humor receptors stimulated.
So.. it is bad that they did some world building to explain how Gideon and the First Order came to power, how they were able to clone and how that „somehow Palpatine returned“ came to be? Jack Black and Christopher Lloyd are celebrities, yes, but because they are actors! Guess what, Pedro Pascal is a celebrity and an actor. Katee Sackoff too. Who else, Carl Weathers, Timothy Olyphant, and Giancarlo Esposito!  Do you want people to play a role once in the show and never reappear again? Because if they aren’t actors yet (remember can’t be known to anyone) and they actually nail the role, they can’t reappear in a second episode because in a week, their status can rise to being a celebrity….  Edit: had not finished this episode. Have you seriously asked how he got the clones?! The episode that revolved around the cloner doctor is the explanation! He was tortured thinking it was the new republic and it was thus easy to recruit him back. Now, I begin to think you’re simply too stupid to even follow the plot of the show… and no, the point of his religion is that he can’t take the helmet off. There was no need to do so. Taking the helmet off is a big reason for fans to hate the Halo series. A skilled actor doesn’t have to show his face to convey his emotions. That’s a big reason why Mandalorian is so fantastic.
Side quest was literally a Milk Run... Love it 😛
Better side quest than anything in the Mandalorian
I find your lack of viewership disturbing.
Mandalorian is so bad… Buy pitch meeting? GOLD
This is so crazy
That intern saga was TIGHT!
I enjoyed a few aspects of a few episodes this season. But that finale episode was so crap.
I can't stop laughing at the driving sequence
Yeah Season 3 was absolute trash, garbage waste of time and continuity rape. What an absolute waste of time.   Basically Pedro is probably not coming back to the show, so they write him out slowly. They had planning issues with him shooting TLOU so they went with this side quest season. Rewrite the Code so she can show her face as actors get paid for their face shown. Yeah Disney in a nutshell.
This Pitch Meeting was probably better than the 3rd season of that show.
This Pitch Meeting was epic - the Intern Guy's adventure was ✨very necessary✨ and ✨exactly why we're all here✨. So. Five stars.  Seriously though, I'm almost very happy to see notifications for Ryan's videos🥺
Skipping a pitch for Andor is super easy, barely an inconvenience
Ryan,   You should had the guy from the “British division” be the intern. So many people complained then that you just didn’t do a British accent. It would have been great inside reference and at the same time aggravate people. lol   Regardless, this one was great. Thank you.
The whole coffee gaf was great but can we address the fact that he referenced the stupid “Somehow Palpatine returned.” line😂
I am in that group that didn't watch Boba because yeah I didn't care lol so seeing the first episode and I was like  wait didn't Grogu leave?? I mean sure I like them back with Mando anyway but when did that happen lol yeah I am not watching Boba Fett no thanks lol I watched everything else though yeah lol
Only three seasons in and The Mandalorian already feels like a very old show that has been going on for decades.
ftr, I thought The Mandalorian was mid before it was cool
The only thing missing was if somehow the producer guy lost all the progress he had during the earlier Mandalorian pitch meeting (S1 and S2), and had to retake some of the story arc.. Anyway, it's top notch stuff from you, as always..
I'm sorry, this season wasn't great. We all waited two years and didn't get a great season.
Good to see the budget has increased for side stories
A bulit-in self-destruct button designed just to destroy years of expensive research? LMFAO. Was it that much of a power brain move to come up with detonable portable explosives? *Cough*   That third "woah" after the exaggerated pause was priceless. Love the side quest montage. xD Really nice job channeling that subtle arrogance and contempt at the beginning of the skit with the series/season pitcher.
Awesome PM super in line with The Mandalorian 😂 Great Job
The sad part is Disney Execs will not know what made the Season bad
Best pitch meeting in awhile. Taking those breaks has really helped his creativity
Absolute gold!
Mando, huh, that’s how I call my man-handles
Best Pitch Meeting Ever!!!! TIGHT!!!
Are we getting an intern guy spinoff series? That would be tight.
DISNEY should be less worried about the Governor of Florida destroying it and more about DISNEY destroying its own franchises like STAR WARS by boring viewers to death. 😁 Watching paint dry is more interesting than anything they are putting out these DAZE.
I'm convinced this entire show is an expensive, elaborate troll.
You truly never miss.
Wow. Some unexpected new content! Excelent!
And so the lore of the Pitch Meeting Cinematic Universe expands...
Boring Side Quest of Intern that will never be mentioned again is super tight!
Heh. Honestly, I’m surprised this one wasn’t twice as long. There was so much nonsense that didn’t get mentioned! The radical tonal shift! The Darksaber, and how easy it was to give away! All Bo-Katan, all the time! Mando’s sudden inability to successfully accomplish anything!
Southland tales.
Do the new Star Wars writers not watch the original 6 movies?  WTF is the deal with clones now just being exact copies of an existing person, even when it comes to age and knowledge?  It has been established that you can clone the person but the clone actually has to be born, raised and trained like a regular human (although at an accelerated rate).  Now it's treated like cloning is actually just copying the person, with the exact same muscle composure, memories, skills and knowledge of the original person. Assuming those clones are in tubes since they were created, they would come out of them with the same mental/muscle development of a toddler!  This is just yet another peace of evidence that Disney just doesn't give a shit about the source material...
We need more intern!!
Was it really not Pedro ?
Great video. The was a great idea. I like to think, to make it more accurate to the show, that after Intern Guy unclogs the toilet, Clerk Guy calls the police for doing work he isn't authorized to do. Then Intern Guy gets arrested, jailed, goes to court, serves his time, loses a hand to some guy in prison, THEN gives the coffee.
Long sidequests are tight!
I wonder for how long Ryan could keep up this level of quality.
Th biggest Mistake Star Wars has made was in not yet casting Robert Picardo for a major role
No spoilers because you should have watched the Bobba Fett pitch meeting you silly goose, the goose who is silly
OH NO! u destroyed my clones, ooooo I just hate it when people destroy my clones, mmmmmm yeah.... I'm so mad...anyway fight me so I can let you escape!
Loved that side quest!!!!!
The PMEU
I cant believe how much you keep improving your videos, this was the best pitch meeting so far.
When Ryan makes a video, you really have to watch until the last second, or you'll miss a good joke...he really is a master of his craft.
"It must be really difficult to find a way to cram in the catch phrases for every video eh? "  "Actually..."
the padding and pacing of this season is confusing. some episodes feel too long and stretched, so i thought that's just because they wanted to fill a 40 min slot, but this is a streaming show right? so they can have a lot more freedom with the length. bafflingly, the one episode that could have used a longer runtime, the finale, was only 35-40 mins long. so they could have used a segment to explain how grogu got there to save mando, they could have used a different scenario so it isn't so convenient for mando to escape, and for an episode that switches perspectives between mando, bo, and the fleet, you'd think the episode is longer, but nope, not at all. wtf?
What did producer guy mean by Well never see him again
Amazing how people love Jack Black in Mario but not in Mando.
Man I love this channel lol. You outdid yourself with this one. Mando deserves it too because they really do make word decisions. Wtf happened? Did they switch Jon Favreau with an unpaid intern?
When the journey is greater than the destination...😂😂😂
Lizzo uggghh disgusting casting
Season 3 of the Mandalorian is kind of like Star Wars Episode 6; it’s good but compared to the last two entries it’s disappointing.
Season 3 felt like a mother sweet talking her baby into opening it's mouth for the baby food.  And us as the baby going, "NO! We want peaches not nasty peas!"
This Pitch Meeting is a nominee for The Best of the Best Pitch Meeting Award.
I should have seen the "this is the way" quote in the side quest coming. I didn't. Best wholehearted laugh of the year so far. Thank you.
Plan a really slow rescue mission is tight
Star Wars bad guys somehow returning is tight!!
ive had my suspicions about this season since it started so shity, but now i know that i can let go of this show
We all know WHY Ryan and the writer guy, producer guy needs therapy... those shows are getting really bad...   BUTTTTT AT THE SAME TIME> THE SKITS FROM RYAN IS GETTING REALLY NICE!!!!!!!!!!
I'm more interested in seeing intern guy again than the side characters in the mandalorean (except kara dunn)
I think your side quest coffee gag backfired. I was actually deeply invested in his journey and I had to know what happened, even though I was supposed to be watching a Pitch Meeting!!!
You forgot the most important part, Bo Katan is now the Mandalorian! An idea that was lazily realized and sloppily executed as a way to get rid of Pedro pascal returning
willow not the main character in his own show, mando getting sidelined, yep
I need intern guy to have his own spin off series leading to a team up short film!
Didn't occur to me until just now, but... If that one Mandalorian has a kid... and he hasn't been exiled... He had to keep the helmet on, didn't he?
We want the intern for the next episodes of pitch meeting!!
Bro that intern gag felt like a mandolorian episode
loved this
I hope we get more cameos like Jack Black and Christopher Lloyd! I didn't recognize Christopher Lloyd at first since it's been a while since I've seen him, and I've never heard of Lizzo lol
Aren't the Mandalorians suppose to be near extinct? Yeah yeah yeah.  so why are they hanging out with their children on a beach filled with monster?  hey shut up.  Well okay then :D
It wasn't perfect but I thought it was still awesome overall. I feel like a lot of people just don't allow themselves to enjoy things nowadays lol.
Poor Tim Meadows. Even when appearing on SW he's overlooked.
So is this supposed to be Ryan's cry for help to signal that he's getting tired of his own formula?
I love the epic music when he goes on the cream quest.
This was brilliant. Mando season 3 was a bunch of task oriented bullshit. Garbage.
On Jack Black and Lizzo. Here, I thought you'd do something with actors being to famous to show their faces in Star Wars. "I thought we liked putting famous people in our projects?" "Not for Star Wars."  "What about Tom Cruise?" "No, to famous." "So, no Tom Cruise in Star Wars?" "No, no Tom Cruise in Star Wars." "Then what about Samuel Jackson?" "Motherfu....!"
2:30 into this and its already the best you've done.
I can't believe how hard I laughed at a car driving for a looooong time thru a beautiful landscape with stirring music 😂
I lost it at "I kind of hate that whole thing where bad guys explain their entire plan before doing it so he's gonna do it after it's already failed!!!" 🤣🤣🤣
I can't express enough how well this episode was done. Ryan you knocked the ball out of the park. The timing was stellar and finding the actors to play the interns! Wow they have amazing chemistry.
I want to see more of the interns!
I just wish they would give a shit about the worlds they create. It's always a spectacle but never any substance.
Love this shit
Wow. That was on point 😅
You’re a freaking genius 🤣🤣
Thank you. I have waited the entire season to hear these words. It's so vindicating. I quit after this season and it's good to see viewership is down because this season was an entire fucking mess.
The whole actual theme of Star Wars is No One Has A Good Family For Very Long.  Doesn't bode well.
The season was so frustrating but I took comfort in knowing we would get an amazing pitch meeting
Perfectly articulated how I felt while watching this season.. This season was the worst among the 3..
That was a glorious side quest.  Riveting and full of action!
Barely super easy convienience.
The hat trick was a good one.
Honestly this was the entire reason I lost interest in the mandalorian. I think bo katahn is cool and I want to see her story unfold.........but not on the mandalorian
Gosh that side quest was perfect. You managed to capture exactly how watching this season felt... except I actually enjoyed watching your side quest.
Best one you’ve done in a while 😂
This was an absolute disaster of a season, the action was absolutely horribly choreographed, the acting was one note, the plot was moving around like a dead seagull and Din Djarin couldn’t even get an full episode to do something
Random Pitch Meeting side quest - I love it! 😂
As somebody who didn't watch Mando, I'm 100% sure this was better than anything it offered.
I don't watch this show but am I hearing correctly that "Mando" is the name of the mandalorian? Is Lando short for "Landalorian"? Wtf happened to star wars?
Your sidequest was better written than mando season 3.
Not sure if the cream in the coffee needed to be a plot point that HAD to be stretched out for so much of the video …oh wait… I’m getting something in my imaginary ear piece… Oh? - That was the point he was making? Ohhhh…. yeah, yeah yeah yeah. I get it. And that was funny. 😅😅😅 I am so happy I took the time to type this out now… lol
Random side quests in the middle of the pitch meeting are tight!
I need to know more about Inter Guy! Please include him more or do another series.
Oh boy! I've been waiting for this!! Joint? Check. Drink? Check. Munch? Check.... Now let me hit play on this thing!
When the pitch meeting video emulates the Mandalorian's stretched concept to the T. Great job.
That was perfect 😭😭😭. As per usual
I love how I only realized what you were doing with the intern gag 75% of the way through 😂. Maybe I'm more of a sucker to side plots than I thought
You kinda ruined your point by making the intern thing amazing. <3
Sir you are a genius
All I can say is, BRILLIANT!
Hm, I was hoping for a real scene of a Montreal depanneur or Machine oceanside highway. Stoopid stooopid
I warned you. Often. "This show will turn into trash, dont get invested in it."  Im not psychic.... IT'S DISNEY!
That's a S TIRE Pitch Meeting episode Sir
Can you make a rocky pitch meeting
Dude complains about him stretching out the dinohatten gag and then does this intern gag
That side quest bit to get cream for coffee is pure genius. Sums up everything you need to know about The Mandalorian. 10 minutes of bad writing padded by 40 minutes of stupid.
Jon Favreau: This series is gonna be great when we finally get to the stuff I have planned with Gina Carano. Kathleen Kennedy: Allow me to reintroduce myself.
Nice
Man, the production cost for these have exponentially increased. Now we have multiple exotic locations filmed in cinematic camera angles, OST, additional actors.
So good of this episode to take the time to act as a backdoor pilot to The Intern series
All you needed to add was a shot of the intern slowly walking from his car in the store parking lot.
I worry for the intern, he might get fired for taking so long to make the coffee
I am relieved he managed to fix the toilet to get the coffee, I was getting really anxious about the whole situation. But it turned out great.
Is it wrong that I now want a show devoted specifically to the adventures of the Interns at Producer Guy's office? .. OK, Just me?
I will watch every Pitch Meeting and then immediately ask for more pitch meetings after
Saw the intern stuff and immediately thought “what is happening? Am I in a fucking K-Hole right now?!”
Omg, they didn't even had the same actor? Man, S3 really was Disney trying to stretch a story that had already concluded.
2:01 Oh I can tell he's going to make it big one day. I'm going to call him Wade.
I still dont know what disney was thinking with that boba fett show..... lets make the best episodes not have boba at all! Thatll develop a loyal fan base....
Side missions with the intern are TIGHT!!
next time we see an Intern Guy it won't be this Intern Guy. it'll be a completely different Intern Guy.
I love the meta commentary of the side missions/spinoffs and how it takes away from the actual video, genius 🤣🤣
O
I was really hoping that he had to find a special plunger...
10/10 pitch meeting!
Jack Black was one of my favorite moments ever. I loved seeing Jack Black!
I love the intern-guy! I would totally watch episodes of Internguy on his quest for producer guy
"we will make it to 8" utterly brilliant
Ironically, the part of the show without Mando in it, was probably some of the best Mando we've had. Cool little story, character arcs, plot, more world building in those 15 minutes than all of sequel trilogy put together. That mountain peak thing, was probably the neatest and coolest thing in all of Disney Star Wars.
Pitch Request: The Brave Little Toaster
I thought season 3 was great. Not sure what everyone is bitching about.
Unlike Disney Star Wars, Pitch meeting never gets old 😂
Well done!
and the subplot is the reason I love your gags.
CANT LIKE THIS ENOUGH!!!
but, but, didn't that intern plot contribute in building the producer world? world building guys. yep
We aren’t gonna see intern with orange tie again??
Super HARD....Barely easy
Mac and me pitch meeting pleaaseeee.
This one is so on point 👉
Never stop making these…NEVER!!!
Love the side-character's side-plot has a side-plot!!! That's so Mandalorian, lol!!!
u r getting good 👍.. apposite of lazy btw
I must first find the the instructions for the 👍 drawing on the screen because I've heard it can be used somehow to help you with things. Here have more 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🏻👍🏼👍🏽👍🏾👍🏿☝️😏
The production value is so much better, they can hire more people!! 😂
The intern guy was a PERFECT summary of the randomness and uselessness of the side quests this season 😂😂😂
If the sidequest is as good as the main one then I'm happy to watch it. And intern's creamer journey was the highlight of the show for me.
Thanks for explaining why I had no idea what had happened between season 2 and 3. I thought we'd get a flashback at some point, but no.
At least the intern had a pretty drive.
Producer: "We DID make the main character the star of the show, Bo Khatan!  I mean, ANYONE could be the Mandalorian-" Fans: "Gonna need you to climb ALL THE WAY off that bait and switch ladder and return it to the Marvel section of Disney."
I like when I get to watch a new pitch meeting while wearing my much treasured SEBAI shirt.
So you have to watch the really terrible "The Book Of Boba Fett" that retconned the ending of season 2 to understand the much terrible season 3? Disney+ here i am!
I think it's odd that when the show stopped for side characters to have an unrelated adventure it didn't bother me
Man - Even nailed the wooden exposition... I mean dialogue for this season.
Side quests are tight
Brilliant !!
Please do a pitch meeting for Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey.
Pointless sidequests are tight!
Exact representation of Disney+ show 🤣🤣
Plot twist: Intern forgot what he was supposed to be paid and that’s not cream in the producer’s coffee.
Christopher Lloyd? Somehow I think there was something true to that one movie he was in... 🤔
So much effort for an amazing gag lololol
Imo Boba Fett should have taken over two episodes.
If you guys aren't making one already could you do one with the new dnd movie
I would definitely watch an entire series of intern guy running errands instead!
“Somehow Moff Gideon returned”  Criticising The Mandalorian’s sloppy writing and simultaneously TROS is super easy, barely an inconvenience and tight simultaneously again
Justice for Intern Guys they need more screen time
And this is exactly why George stayed away from Hollywood. They would have ruined the OT from the start. Disney is displaying why letting corporate types in on things is such a bad thing.
Best Pitch so far...
Fantastic Beasts has the Canada plot, and the Mandalorian has sidequests
That's brilliant dude 😂
Maannn the intern side quest….why do I want to see more of that?! “The Book of Intern Guy” where he pitches the movies and tv shows that were not green-lit or cancelled in production
Thank you for the dopamine hit Ryan. It was something I needed today. Had me giggling as always.
I just laughed so hard at shot of a car, I had to pause the video. What the hell?
Probably should fire that intern. Instead of walking to like the Disney commissary for some cream he drove all the way to some remote town, probably just so he can get paid for taking his Jeep off-road. Then instead of paying the store manager with a reimbursable expense, he wastes even more time unclogging a toilet. That's gotta be the worst intern ever.
Intern Guy who gets coffee = Kathleen Kennedy's bitter early career and why she is out to destroy everything Lucasfilm
The whole side character story was genius lol
The irony is that Ryan could have filled at least another 30 minutes of pitch meeting with ridiculous points from that season, even without side quests.
The Intern side plot was more interesting than the entirety of Mando season 3.   Also I didn’t finish it so when you said Jack Black was in this season I thought you were lying. I still think you are tbh
You should do beast with Idris Elba, they make some of the dumbest decisions ever, like his daughter sleeping next to the broken window the lion broke  just one of many.
The longer the intern subplot continued the funnier it became. 😂
Mandalorian has fallen so much and its not that hard to make things interesting just dont pad the run time with long walking scenes, telling stories of people that don’t move the plot forward and i dont remember what his plan was for season 3 was it to take a bath find a new home or give up his dark saber to some chick that is all ways saving him because the writers want a strong independent woman to be in the spotlight more. this show has gone 360 dredges
i cant believe i enjoyed that long ass side quest so much, dude you're a genius lol
Ooohh accepting turds as payments is TIGHT!!
Yeahhhh , side quest .... got it ...
I hadn't even noticed that season 3 was out. Does it suck? Should I just skip it and watch the pitch meeting instead? Edit: I couldn't help myself so I watched this video. Season 3 does indeed seem to suck, so Ryan just saved me several hours of my life. Thank you, Ryan.
Oh boy oh boy here we go kekw
You should do Star Wars Andor show as a pitch meeting!
This is probably one of your best Pitch Meetings yet! The intern bit was great lol
0:30 he forgot the "and like it" right before the "or else".
Disney logic: Imagine a Mandalorian show that’s not about the main character.
So if you follow the disney trail - when can we expect the intern guy spin-off?
Does this mean we may get an intern guy spinoff series on your channel soon!? Because if so, I may, I may watch one or two of them.
Love the character developement from Producer guy
When did a whole season of a show become only around 8 or 9 episodes. Currently rewatching Fringe and those season were 20 plus episodes and all around 50 minutes long.  Sucks to only get a few episodes then have to wait a year or more for the next season.
Hey! I want more intern!
They should insert producer guy in a random episode of Screen Rant like they did with Din in Book of Boba...
Perfect! The whole season was just so vapid, boring, and full of superfluous elements that end up going absolutely nowhere like Moff's clones, the sub-plot about the ex-Empire engineer, a whole episode that exists as little more than a vehicle for feel-good cameos, or the fan service flashback scene with the Jar Jar Binks actor. The first two seasons were already excessive with the side-quests, but it was more forgiveable then because there was more momentum to the overarching plot, which was sorely missing here. And, oh yeah, of course recycling Moff as the villain was incredibly lazy, especially in the uninspired way in which it was done.
this is next level satire, very well done
The driving scene had me thinking you had a sponsor and we were going to see some product placement.
The side quest with that intern really felt like the Mando episode that had Doctor Pershing in it.
-Pedro Pascal cant come. Hes doing some show where hes this anti-hero escorting a kid through a lawless futuristic frontier. -Are you saying... -Yes. Prospect is soon made into a series!
I wish he'd mentioned how The supposed Mandalorian keeps having to be rescued by Bo Katan.
2:20 traveling montage! Travel montages are tight!
More intern side quests please
Intern guys side story had a better payoff than Dr. who-cares and crew cut imperial girl.
Brother, this was such an incredible addition to the usual Golden formula of Pitch Meeting. You branched out, and it seriously paid off. A+, very tight.
Sir, you have officially opened up Pandora’s box! I wish to see more adventures of Intern Guy!!
Wait! Wait! What happened at the creamer store?!?!?
This is brilliant. 😅
I love all Star Wars stuff and watch as much as humanly possible!!! Everyone’s “critiques” are just silly to me, I’m thankful for it all so I don’t really care.
This video does bring up a very important question that just can't be ignored.  Where did intern guy get that tie?  Was it online or did he go to the store?
I´d never thought to laugh that much just by watching an SUV going somewhere 😂
Nice that you recognize the stupidity in the business and find a way to make fun of it, love it,.
We’re still waiting for the Andor pitch meeting
I love how the Mandalorians are very competent and efficient warriors, really shows their dedication to warfare and how they are trained since birth to be soldiers in search for Mandalore which is definitely non-habitable please trust me.
Will we ever learn who clogged the toilet? Probably not until next season ...
The side quest was masterfully done!
The funniest Pitch Meeting yet, couldn't stop laughing at the intern's side quest. My hat's off to you Ryan, you're a genious!
Ryan How. HOW! HOOOOW! Do you make me crap my pants laughing over and over again!
Still better than Book of Boba Fett.
I was wondering why the video was 7 minutes long... didn't expect that.
I will accept turds as payment
The intern side quest was actually more relevant to the Mando's Coruscant episode, which actually contributed nothing to the story. We never see Pershing again, his fate doesn't matter, and the imperial officer that returned as a spy didn't need to be shown there because she doesn't do anything there has has any impact on Mando.
Absolutely NAILED it #sidequest
THAT'S THIS SHOW 😂😂😂
The side quest was amazing!
You are a genius bro. That 7 min of joy was so entertaining.  I tip my hat off to you sir
Could you do TMNT 2007 movie pitch meeting??
Every Disney series does this shit and it's getting old
Could you PLEASE figure out how the Disney “ writers” can view your critiques, please Sir could ya? Think of it as a side quest to the excellent material you are already creating. I’m sure it’ll be “ real eeeeeasy”………
Classic
But the creamer thing had nothing to do with the rest of the video and only served to extend the runtime of… ohhhhh
I made it half way through episode 3 before giving up
Itern guy has a pretty nice car for an intern
And now I know what your toilet looks like, it's all coming together.
Actually he’s playing a show being a gay cowboy. So embarrassing.
Who is Ryan George and who is George Ryan? The producer guy or the writer?
'Side quests' are why I gave up on Last Of Us around the 5th episode.
Micah 4:5 5 All the nations may walk in the name of their gods, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.
I can't believe you found a way to monetise half-heartedly unclogging a stranger's loo! Genius!! 🤣
This is exactly how the show was done. Spot on
Hey I came here to watch a pitch meeting what the heck is with these interns, who the hell are they, is this some kind of Disney bait and switch?
The Celebrity Hat should be a recurring character, imo. As well as the Intern.
Wait, was that not Pedro?
Intern guy is getting a spin-off show confirmed
We watched the Mandolorian then cancelled our Disney subscription.  What a pile
That intern side quest had more plot and character development than the entirety of season 3
Why was this so much more entertaining than TM season 3?
In just two minutes pitch meeting perfectly encapsulated what was wrong with season 3. I said this repeatedly that Disney cannibalized season 3 and I hope for their sake someone important actually watches pitch meeting because they sure as hell ain't reading any of my dozens of comments on random YouTube channels lol.
Ryan is always on the nose with his criticisms
"I think this year, we should only let people show their face if they are neither white nor male. White males are the devil" "Jack Black asked if he could be in the show." "Well, I do like black. It's a very inclusive colour" "Jack Black is white" "We're going to have to put a helmet on him" "We're out of helmets" "Do you have any beards?" "Sure, here" "Do we have any bigger ones?"
You are comedy genius, that bit with inter GOLD
This might be the best episode of PM ever lol
This season of The Mandalorian was truly abysmal, perfect for a Pitch Meeting!  Thanks for doing this, Ryan.
Boom. Roasted.
OMG, this is way too good.
This was an exceptional pitch meeting. Almost as if Ryan George's original videos had a kid with Pitch Meeting 😂
It's EMBARRASSING how bad the "storytelling" is. 🙄 Almost as if they've practiced their insanity for years, doubled down on the jank, and ignored all professionals (and certain fans) who actually understand and have studied storytelling.  "YEAHYEAHYEAH!" 😁
I remember almost giving a crap when I heard about Luke rescuing Grogu or whatever... Then the objectively best part of the entire show is literally undone in another series... That sucked so bad the Star hates it... Disney... Is something wrong at home? I mean something's the matter with you guys.... Oh yeah, Darth Kennedy, my bad... Is there a more useless, creatively bankrupt Producer in all history? (No. No there really isn't. Ed Wood had more coherent ideas and The Room is more rewatchable than the crap she... well craps out. No wonder Favereau's gone)
I think Producer Guy also makes clones of himself and together, they overtook the entire city. Somehow. 🤷🏼‍♀️
The store cut scene to get cream you nailed it that's how the the Mandalorian was going in that Episode.🤮
The pulling the names out of the hat was great
This is the best pitch meeting ever lol the whole side plot intern thing was probably more effort than the writers of the mandalorian put into season 3 tbh.
I tuned in to watch producer guy and writer guy not intern guy. They should've made his own show instead of taking over this one 🤬
What a grand adventure! Or was that just the name of the car he drove?
Where is the ad in the middle of the pitch ?
Misusing interns for personal work is tight.
The only channel where I can always hit the like button even before I watch the video.
I see what you did there coffee cream guy 😉
We must see intern again!
Ryan took a page from the Jurrasic World people and made a car commercial into a pitch meeting
😂😂😂😂- EXCELLENT “ Producer Guy Side Quest Story”……..SUMMARY;)-! On. The. Nose.👍
Never gonna see him again... except in the prequels
Hi Pitch, You know you could  hire some actors too. Help the unemployment rate.
I actually really enjoy the side quest episodes. Adds to the adventure feel. But that’s me.
Damn, I hope that intern gets a spin-off...
Ryan put in a *lot* of effort here just to be relevant to Mando S3. A man of focus, commitment, and sheer fucking will.
I love this channel!!!! Ryan needs to write for Disney,  not that they'd listen to his reasonable takes
OK, real talk, the whole thing where Gideon explains what he was planning after it's already been stopped could work. Like the villain is so damned exasperated with the hero that they take a moment or three to vent about exactly WHAT the hero ruined.
Congratulations. You won the internet today and made it look super easy, barely an inconvenience. Except for Intern Guy. He had quite the adventure…
6:42 you can have too much of a good thing.
You nailed it.
The internet side quest was brilliant! 😅
the entire show plot was built like it was a video game plot
Clogged toilets are TIGHT!
@3:53 They know the monster won't eat the kid because that monster has eaten OTHER kids, and they worked out the monster's dietary habits from the timing it took for that to happen.  Why yes, being unclear WOULD be a step up from something that stupid!
Ryan George Lampooning Disney in an Epic Pitch Meeting is tight.
Can't wait for "The Book Of Intern-Guy".
Genius. Simply genius. Thanks for summarizing why I not only left this show, but why I have no need to go back to it.
DUDE........ THE INTERN PLOT WAS SOOOOOO COOL HAAHAHAH
Best episode EVER
Great nuff said
Highlander pitch meeting please.
Experimental Pitch Meetings are TIGHT
I didn't watch season 3 because it might have spoiled the Pitch Meeting.  Also because i lost hope for anything comes out of Disney.
THIS IS SPOT ON PERFECTION 👏🏻👏🏻
Intern guy was never seen again...
Best episode ever!!!!!
Man, that interna has some nice wheels. I thought they were basically slave labour?
THIS IS BRILLIANT I just love the sidequest 🙂 Cheers from Poland!
Moff Gideon really had a "self-destructinator" on his clone vats.
I've always told people that the one thing this channel needed was more stock footage. I'm happy someone finally listened. It feels good to be heard.
This is the most accurate pitch meeting to date. Incredible work
So the next Pitch Meeting has to be about the intern guy, but then halfway through just do a normal Pitch Meeting for Evil Dead or something.
The Ryanverse expands exponentially.
I liked season 3 for the most part there were a few problems for me but overall still better than book of boba fett and kenobi and andor for me
Ryan, you'll never not be funny!
It's amazing how Disney messed up the only Star Wars project that the general public actually likes.  I guess that's what happens when you let a focus group write all of your Disney+ content.
To be fair, i like the world building here.
From now on I'm playing that soundtrack on my way to the store. May as well make my bad shopping choices feel epic.
Brilliant! Love the hat part. It wouldn't surprise me at all if that's how they do things at lucus film now. But great pitch meeting as always. Thanks Ryan. 👍
Adding pointless side stores to episodes is tight.
Ryan is simply the greatest
There's been Interns all along!? PLOT TWIST!!
The intern interlude was brilliant 😂
I was wondering why this Pitch Meeting was so long, and then the intern's side quest happened. 😂
Sidequests are tight
Best season so far!
Pitch meeting was on Point
I would really love to see a pitch meeting for Andor
This episode was better than anything disney had put out on Groomer +.
Upvote if you hate Baby Yoda as much as I do.
That intern side quest perfectly crystallized Mando Season 3!  Barely an inconvenience.  Well done sir!
I haven’t seen Mandalorian and not planning to see it anytime in the future, but this pitch meeting is fantastic!
"We're Disney, watch **everything** we make, or ELSE." - Producer Ryan "Ya ya ya" - Writer Ryan
Wait, who are you? Name? Do you have one?
People were actual upset that "the bath" didn't take all season.
Surprised he didn't comment on Grogu taking a droid as a body.
What a nice dodge magnum commercial
2:40 probably used a car ad
Once again, I must ask for a clone wars pitch meeting so, I’m doing that now, just to be clear, that is what I’m doing
More side quests please, they are the best
You didn't have to do so much just to prove a point like cleaning a public toilet I mean love your dedication 🎉🎉🎉😅😅
Ryan that was hilarious. You poked at just right things too. I loved the meaningless drive and mission of the intern. It so highlighted that pointless story they just shoved into that one episode. Thanks for the giggles! - BTW, do you think you could do a Pitch Meeting for The Bourne Identity? Thanks again!
An unintended aspect of the Cream for Coffee side quest: picturing Ryan George on tribal flute solo.
This is gold. The new format with a side quest was well done.
This is the way.
Stretching plot-points is tight!
I see what you did there and I pissed my pants  a little laughing. Oh and now I hate how they make Din Jarin do busywork and slow travelling and show side quests so much.
Where was the intern's little green frog baby friend to accompany on him on his side quest?
Lmao Lizzo? I thought that was a joke. Wtf haha
That intern bit was better world building than what this new season has to offer. No joke. Even though it was filler, it was oddly fun seeing other parts of the Pitch Meeting building.
Best side quest ever😊 In every media😂
This one took us on one hell of a journey. Barely an inconvenience unclogging that toilet.
I think this is the funniest script meeting I've ever watched
I always love when they say SUPER EASY BARELY AN INCONVENIENCE
Brilliant
This was amazing. It might be my favorite video you made, dude. The grocery store quest got me lol.
Doing a side quest to get some cream is tight!
Yep, I made the mistake of eating and drinking while watching this one. Stuff definitely came out the wrong place during the car ride.
There’s a Season 3?
god damn this one had me rolling...
I will never get tired of these
I was immediately invested in Producer Guy's intern's coffee-related solo-adventure, so shows what you know, Ryan!
Hahah this is one of the best ones in recent memory. Perfectly captures how little actually happens in this show. I gotta cancel my Disney+ subscription.
Love that you are developing creatively. Other channels aren’t as brave. You did it here and it worked. Yay risk taking!
Ryan George sidequests are tight!
How many look-alikes are there in the Screen Rant U-verse?  Their father really got around.
I’m shocked anyone watched passed the first episode of the first season but people just keep watching whatever
Will we really never see his intern again? Or is this the backdoor pilot for This Producer Guy's Intern?
Never script the end things lol
While I appreciate the coffee skit they really danced around the whole bo consuming all the plot points and relevance of the season
As someone who has never watched more than a few seconds of all those new star wars shows, every new pitch meeting makes me more happy of this decision
This short video was better than the whole season of Mandalorian.
Hey Ryan, big fan, but I clicked on this video to watch a Pitch Meeting™, not this weird intern stuff. Please refrain from this in the future! >:( Anyway, big fan!
Monetizing the living daylights out of a small green Muppet is Tight! Kermit agrees.
LOL
Love try channel and videos. Keep up the great work!!
When the intern scene in Pitch Meeting is way more brilliant than the entire 3 season of Mandalorian, just tell a lot of how the series was doing.
I knew there would be a 'super easy barely an inconvenience' about Mando's hallway escape. Wowowowow. Wow.
Whatever happened to that scientist/prisoner dude? Meh, who cares?
"Watch everything we make or else!" "Or else what?" "Or else you're RACIST!"
It wasn’t the best season
Admittedly, the Pershing episode was actually really really good
Do Picard Season 3!!! :D
This PM is better than the entire season 3
I loved that side plot! It totally added to this episode!
Oooh that sideplot about intern guys (interns guys, not sure how to pluralize them) was TIGHT! I'm definitely glad that was the focus of this recap for a significant amount of the "season's story". Wowowow 🤣🥰
That extra long coastal driving scene was tight! LOL!
The drive to the store was so scenic! I now have a burning desire to know exactly where Producer Guy lives.
"We're Disney, watch everything we make, or else"
Writer Guy: "Intern and Shop Guy will be getting their own spin-off next year" Producer Guy: "But why though?" Writer Guy: "Because money"
Side quests are tight!
Thank you so much for this. I could not understand why baby Gru left with Luke in season 2 and back in Ep1 Season 3 like he  never left.
Taking an entire 2 minutes of this pitch meeting to focus on Intern Guy's side story is TIGHT
Not even 3 minutes in and it’s better than the actual show
A side plot within the meeting proved the point.
Oh pointlessly cutting away to other characters that have nothing to do with the show is tight
Yeah, stopped watching after episode 4... ugh, it definitely felt like every twobit executive added their input to claim part of the 'success' and ended up ruining what was a decent show (nothing groundbreaking, but decent)
Ryan has helped me save so much by not signing up to disney +.
T H E   I N T E R N  - The spin-off.
For some reason, I want to purchase a Hyundai Santa Fe....
I want to see the intern again
hahahah fuck that wasss sooooo goood
Amazing Vid!! Never disappoint.
This pitch meeting is so cool
The moment they undid Mando's arc from season 2 by _The Book of Bobba Fett_ was the straw that broke the (at least my) camel's back.   Okay *FINE!* For those staunch TLJ defenders maybe Disney needed a way to justify why Luke gave up entirely on why Jedi training isn't "cool" any more after the frustratingly Kylo Ren.  This Pitch Meeting saved me so much time and money.
Unlike the mandalorian season 3, I watched this Pitch Meeting to the conclusion.
The side story of The Quest for Creamer! Lol
I liked the show but it had a lot of flaws...scared to watch this😂😂😂 2:28 is he going on safari...😂
Apparently, Canada has no stores in their citys, but instead located far away in a random spot. The kind of knowledge you gain here in this channel is mind-blowing!
4:26  I thought he was gonna say, "Stetson" or "7-3/8."
Brilliant!
Best one yet. Loved every second of it.
This might be the best pitch meeting so far
Hahahaa omg this was the funniest pitch meeting i've seeen in a while. EDIT: i love all of them but this one was really really good
We NEED more of intern!
This is definitely one of the best pitch meetings, loved the cream skit
Love how this video was more thought out than Mando Season 3.
I miss shows where the main character is the main character.
I love how literally nothing happens the entire season and it doesn't change a single thing in the universe other than push Mando out of his own show
I clicked this to see producer guy, not some random intern on a side quest.... Or maybe you were trying to make a point?
“Maybe we should have the main character be the main character of their own show”  This is how I felt about CW’s The Flash, where they have episodes especially in the final season that don’t involve him and focus more on the other characters on his team
It's sad how stupid consumers have become and because it, writers can put in half of the effort and distract you nostalgia and cameos. People are actually defending and claiming this is best season thus far, how Sway, how?;?
You laugh but the first half of ep 3 was the best Mando has ever been.
I can't never see Intern Guy again!  He needs his own spin off series on the Ryan George channel!
The side quest was the perfect product placement for cross country vehicle's, plungers and clearly the best creamer ever. Another master piece, Ryan.
Do Splice!
You should have put at "StutterShock" watermark on the car footage for extra fun
Not mentioning the pirates episode at all is tight!
this was one of your best ones yet!
Really wonderful commitment to the bit 😂
I can't wait for the new YouTube series "The Book of Producer Guy's Intern"
Greatest PM ever!!
They should just make a show called Generic Star Wars Moments that are barely an inconvenience.
I was not expecting that side quest but I was all there for it, love you Intern guy!
The 1:36-3:16 segment had me rolling 😂😂😂
hahaha... star wars villains love "somehow returning"...
The Pitch Meetings are getting world building now
I can't wait for next season of Producer Guy!
Season 4 should definitely be the last one, considering the lackluster nature of this one.
The moment he said, "Hey, intern?" 😂 knew what was to come.
This is the way...
Side Quest to the Side Quest to the Side Quest is Tight!  And this was spot on for S3 of Mando.  Too bad Pedro had obligations to star in his saving the kid show to star in his saving the kid show.  Wow wow wow... Wow.
The intern side-quest as a commentary on the show is the kind of brilliance that keeps me coming back for more.
So much truth here.  This is the way.
Intern spin off series!
Lol the "sidequest" was gold
Dude.  Absolutely brilliant.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
The ENTIRE side quest sums up this season!!!
We need more intern side-stories!  :D
Loved the Intern side quest jejejjej  And now that you’re feeling creative, shall I recommend a pitch meeting of a movie that actually got rejected by producer guy, like that Nicolas Cage Superman film or the recent Batgirl xd. I think that might be a really funny twist and make for a good setup for new interactions and jokes
Better production value and writing than Mano.
The way the "oh, really?" was incorporated into the intern convo?   *chef's kiss*
At what moment where you like, oh my gosh there actually doing this.
Ryan, you nailed the intern gag.
I find your lack of Andor disturbing
Meh.. as with all the Star Wars or Marvel content now seems like you just troll the forums of angry basement neckbeards for the complaints they have about everything... the people who all think they are screenwriters and yet none of them are.  There was very little wrong with Mando: if you are into Star Wars, missing Boba Fett doesn't even make sense, it's ok for the main character to not be on screen every 3 seconds and for stories to have secondary plots, and the cameos were humorous in a campy episode by people, at least 2 of the 3, who are... ready?.... ACTORS... they are still actors, in a show.. imagine that.  Pitch meeting used to point out great and funny plot holes... now it's just regurgitating internet hate by haters, dude.
another lovely stabbing thank you
Only a degenerate that works for Disney would consider Lizzo a celebrity.
Unexpected intern side-quests are TIGHT.
Love the side quest!
Brilliant as always :D :D :D
4:53 Imperial Commandos.. not Stormtroopers. Otherwise, awesome Pitch Meeting!
This is hilarious 😂 😂😂
This was an incredible episode!!! Great little side quest
Randomly deciding to cancel every single thing that happened in S2 finale is tight
Ive been looking forward to this
Wait am I going to have to watch Pitch Meeting Story of Editor to get this one?
Oh nooooo the intern guy
love the dedication to the side quest gag
If you go watch the High Republic promo they have a white board with bullet points. "No main character" was on it. I think that is just a Disney thing now.
Adding a pointless charachter or 2 to the story for the mid section of your show is actually super easy, barely an inconvenience!
brilliant
The PMU is expanding
At this point we're gonna need a Pitch Meetingverse pitch metting
It really was such a meh season, every time I got excited about something they either dropped the ball or just brushed it away without any further thought or implications. Really starting to feel that Disney is making decisions only to sell merch now. Doesn't help that the Mando page on Disney plus has a link to mech store 🙄
1:17 exactly my point!
Keeping up with new episodes via notifications is super easy, barely even a problem ❤🫶
This was such a funny pitch meeting lol
The coffee side quest 😂😂 10/10
Best one yet! Thanks
Chugging room temperature coffee is tight.
Since season one I said this show was written by a 5-year-old but it wasn't preachy so I said OK its cool,everyone praised Favreau and after he ruined Boba now this ppl wanna say it's Kennedy it's all him.
Episode went really HARD on the meta side-stories gag ... and i'm all for it XD
HOW does Kathleen Kennedy still have her job??? A man this incompetent would've have been fired after The Last Jedi. I guess she has that "privilege" I keep hearing so much about.
I haven’t seen this season. So I’m contemplating watching this or waiting  I’ll just watch this i don’t care anymore
Oh my gosh this side quest is so fucking annoying as it was Mandalorian 😂😂 dude you are awesome
Main takeaway here THERE ARE  MULTIPLE PRODUCER GUY AND SCREEN WRITER GUY?!
Using, "Intern guy" to run a, "side quest" with specific tasks to complete was such a GREAT way to poke fun at this, "side quest" season. I've never watched a Pitch Meeting that wasn't, "wow, wow, wow..........wow."
Ok, the hat part was hilarious 😂
When the parody youtube video had more thought put into it than the actual show itself.
Trying to finish Mando Season 3 was not easy, very much an inconvenience, in contrast to watching this Pitch Meeting (also, did Intern Guy have to drive through Japan and California to complete his quest?)
Wibble!! XD
How do you not mention the Grogu fight?
Watching irrelevant side characters not connected to the plot is tight!
I can’t be the only one who really wants to see the intern have little side quests more in the future
Love the running gag of side quests taking over a chunk of the Mando pitch meetings
That side quest to get coffee cream was better than anything Disney put out lately.
lmao the intern thing was brilliant
🤣🤣🤣❤❤❤Star Wars is dead 😄😄😄🙂🤔😔😪😪😪
Oh, how the mighty have fallen...  Great PM, as usual!
oh intern guy, where did you go? were you just an inconvenience? hardly so
I love how Disney is it’s own worst enemy because they double down on everything they do because they think they are the only media in the world.
Finally someone noticed the boring ass filler-episodes in Mandalorian, which are like 80% of each season.
Bruh!!! Mofo really did a car driving scene lol
He sure did take us on a ride
Thanks Ryan, you are saving me SO much money by not needing to subscribe to crummy streaming services or paying to watch lousy movies at theaters.
The side quest is genius!  I was sooo hoping Dwayne Johnson's name would get pulled out of the hat, lol.
I'll be honest, Intern Guy had a pretty good story arc.
Yeah, Season 3 of the Mando was pretty disappointing honestly. There was like... no goddamn plot for most of the season.
Hahaha you nail it every time Ryan.
The intern side-quest killed! had me lol'ing  Thanks Ryan
Watching the Pitch Meeting for a show/movie that you haven’t seen nor ever plan on seeing is  a choice you can make.
Exactly. EXACTLY!!!! That Intern side quest, LMAO!
There's a new character in the pitch meetings universe 😂
Please do Air Bud next 😊
Star Wars and Marvel shows have become homework instead of enjoyment.
I don’t know why you were so critical, the book of Bo Kata- I mean The Mandalorion Season 3 was one of the seasons of all time.
Intern Coffee Getter Guy spinoff series in the works.
I hate that Lizzo is famous so much. What a useless, untalented person. Is she a secret Kardashian?
Ryan: 'Maybe we should make the main characters be the main characters on their own show' Disney+: wtf no the misdirect is how we make spin-off money, don't rock the boat!
As soon as he cut to the intern, I knew that gag was going to run on way too long 😂
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Our Boi hired intern, said intern drove in his Volvo just for cream, and gulped that turdish coffee down just for this skit. Massive respect!
Best One Yet!!
Another Mandalorian pitch meeting - another side quest in Ryanverse 👌
The stupidly long driving shot to get the creamer, then the return journey.... spot on for how these shows expand pointless scenes to fill screen time, while at other times warping characters from place to place in no time at all (Ahem....Rings of Power...)
Intern side quests are tight!
I like how Ryan is slowly introducing the more wackier aspects of the videos on his own Ryan George channel into Pitch Meetings.
Next time on The Mandalorian:season 6 ,mando crosses universes to earth and joins percy jackson in killing the hydra Kim Kardashian ...yeah all shows are just going to become fanfiction at one point ...
The good news: Mandalorian S3 got a fast pitch meeting! The bad news: The wait for The Last of Us series and John Wick 4 pitch meeting continues.  No major criticism here, though. It's all gold from Ryan, and I have all the faith that it's worth the wait for when they do come.
Are side stories going to keep being in Mando pitch meetings?  Hope so
old christopher llojd looks like mikael barryman
So from now, until Ryan retires, we will have to keep any eye out to see if Intern Guy ever crops up again.
"WHY ARE YOU AT SOUP?!"
Im almost finished with season3. Still not sure what the point is
Any chance of getting an Andor pitch meeting?
Can't wait to see 'Intern-man Adventures' show soon and have it be taken over by Michael Pickleseller. I love that Pickleseller..
Intern gag is so on point
To be honest I quite liked this side quest
If you could do Andor, and the Marvel Special Presentations, that'd be great
Halfway through Obi-wan...I got disinterested. Turns out Mando season 3 wasn't even worth watching.
You just keep getting better man. Fantastic as usual. Super breezy, barley incontinent or something
John wick 4?
Well this journey explains why my dad still hasn't come back from that milk run. 💀
Ryan George: I felt a great disturbance in the Force. As if a million voices suddenly yawned in boredom and shut off their TVs.
That recreation was hilarious, good job mate and thanks for the laugh
Stop watching Disney. Trash content. Until Ryan gets his hands on it that is
The Interns little parody has the EXACT same feel as the Mandolorian episode in Book of boba fett. you probably had that skit idea back when that show came out and we’re begging for Mandolorian S3 to do something similar so you could do the skit
Everything Everywhere all at Once!
The only acceptable universe where side characters and side quests is allowed is the Ryanverse
This is a pitch meeting, side quest documentry, coffee and car advertisements rolled into one.
The side story with the interns is TIGHT!
Holy shit I’m so glad I skipped this show now
We're never gonna see the intern again!?!? Noooo!
You should do dungeons and dragons
The sidequest joke was so good lmao
I've worn glasses for over 30 years and I've only ever owned one pair of glasses at time.  The amount of different glasses Ryan owns amazes me.
Pascal really didn’t have the time?
I want more intern guy
So are there multiple producer guys
Masterpiece
I know, I know you like my moustache I-I know, I know you like my moustache I know, I know you like my moustache I-I know, I know you like my moustache
Can't wait for the limited series about the Intern who actually used the cream for his Producer Guy with the Store Clerk and his toilet cameo
Best one yet
Probably the best  Pitch Meeting ever!!
I hope the intern gets a spinoff show. I need things resolved.
So when does the intern get a spin-off!? 😂
The Pitch Meeting Expanded Universe. Hoping to one day see a crossover with the Naming Stuff people.
I thought episode 3, the one on coruscant, was one of the best episodes not only of the season, but the whole show.
The intern side quest was an unexpected surprise, but a welcomed one
Season 3 - This Is NOT the way
That intern bit was great!  Perfectly encapsulated my feelings of that random episode.   couldn't make it past the like 4th or 5th episode. Completely skipped the random insert episode as I could not be bothered to care.  Having the main character who used to be this one man army be rescued by some lady, twice, was also rather bad.  I came here to see Mando kick butt and take names, not some chick who thinks the rest of Mando's tribe is nuts.   Like come on Disney, you used to write better than this, what happened?
This was PERFECT!! This season was all over the place.
Absolutely SPOT ON!
Pitch Meeting: Mandalorian: Season 3: Intern Quest is _TIGHT!_
Oh god, I hope they never stop producing the Mandalorian. Even thought I'm gonny stop watching after this season, because "WTF was that", I still want to see the ptich meetings.
Hey Ryan, is there a possibility that the püitch meetings could be uploaded to spotify? I love to listen to them when I am going to sleep.
I can't wait to see Intern Guy #2's redemption arc. He kinda needs one after selfishly taking the last creamer. Definitely needs a sympathetic backstory to go along with it as well.
I bet they actually pulled celebrity names from a hat for that one episode!
I love the longer Pitch Meetings!
Alright, I’ll admit, that entire getting coffee bit to poke fun at the new republic stuff was hilarious. Phenomenal skit.
Better than the season. This is the way.
is this the new episode of the mandalorian?  With so many side quest with side characters, it thought i was watching a new episode of the mandalorian but no special guest???
Or Manda.  Nobody calls him Manda.  I don't get it.
This is the way!! 😂🤎
I await "Pitch Meeting: Book of the Intern" with baited breath.
xDDDDDDDDDDD
Boba fett also took a very important bath
I never saw the third season cause I know Ryan would have a better summary for my enjoyment. Saved me weeks of waiting.   Thank the force we have Ryan George.
They should have ended the season with Din not adopting Grogu and then setting up the next season where Din and Grogu go on a journey to find Grogu’s home world and actual birth parents. We could learn way more about Yoda’s species and it would be way better than the ending we got.
🙂😃😄😁😆😂🤣🤣🤣Watching the intern's dramatic cream-sidequest was super easy, barely an inconvenience! Also, critique-wise: so on point. Whoopps! Whooppsie!!
The intern bit was hilarious
Ok Ryan you made the point the show should follow the main character
This is incredible, I was laughing unstobbably
This might be the best Pitch meeting episode 😂 But sad to see the pedestrians all look different than typical Ryans we get
Tangent or wha ?🤣🤣🤣 the hat was tight!
I hope someone at Disney watches this and finally realize that shows shouldn't just neglect their protagonists.
Expanding the Pitch Meeting Cinimatic Universe with two Intens, a travel montage, Shopkeeper and creamy coffee is TIGHT!
I like to see the Book of the Intern show, looks great!
I was laughing so hard during the intern side quest!🤣
Hello Ryan George! could you do a pitch meeting of Scott pilgrim vs the world? And please do not stop not scripting your endings .... They are funny!
Hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha hahaha can't stop laughing loved it especially the intern
Side quests on the side of other side quests. Wonderfully mocked!
I kinda feel like the whole internship was to stretch the video but I enjoyed it also why is no one talking about grogus new walk wtf was that
I get why lots of people didn’t like this season, but maaaaan there were some banger moments
TIGHT Producer Guy
Screw you Lizzo. You suck.
i know ryan is making fun off random side quests but i reallly enjoyed that side quest it helped us see the pitch meeting universe the pmu
That intern side plot was great
We finally get to explore the amazing world of Ryan's!!!
Two for two so far for a side quest being included in Mandalorian pitch meetings.
This was a classic...
Absolute Genius my friend, Literally making the biggest point 2 minutes into the pitch. Who wants to see the main character in their own show??? Great stuff!
I was too busy typing to follow why this pitch meeting turned into a scene from a movie and yet I was still able to figure it out.
this was damn hilarious bro, loved the huge waste of time getting the creamer hahaha
But, what happens with Store Guy? Does the store get busier now?
I think it's fine to have an episode of a show that focuses on different characters as long as the story of the different character parallels and impacts the main character's story, problem is the side story in Mando S3 has little to no relevance to Mando's story so it feels out of place and pointless (and in Boba Fett Mando's story with Grogu and Jedi has nothing to do with Boba's story either ;-;;)
I was waiting for this one
You say there isn't going to be a Return of the Intern but we all know he's a fan favorite and the executives aren't going to pass up on free money. I look forward to the spin off show.
I hit like within 30 seconds and continued to laugh a lot.  Top-class observational humour as always, absolutely nailing the manifold issues across the season.  The driving montage to the Morricone-esque music was a particular delight.  Kudos.  🙂
Greater world building than The Mandalorian
Man, the intern's questline really resonated with me.
wow wow wow wow...........wow🤣🤣🤣
"you are able"  Hey. that's ablesim!!! REEEE!!!!!!!!!!
😂….perfect episode..!
Watching the intern guy going to buy Creame is tight. For him, it was super easy, barely an inconvenience.
So so glad I never watched this season.
Pitch meeting getting more and more
Finally, Pitch Meeting's out. Now I don't have to watch the show. Thanks Ryan!
yay!!!!
Wait was Pedro really never on set for this season???
I can't believe Mando took-over two episodes from Boba Fett and Boba wasn't even mentioned in S3 of Mandalorian
I don't know if I should be sad or glad that watching an episode of Pitch Meeting poking fun of a modern Disney film or show is better than watching an entire movie or series made by Disney.     I think I might be glad.... I think.
🤣 🤣 🤣
I would love to see the pitch meeting for the new All Quit On The Western Front Movie.
Meaningless side stories to prove a point are tight!
First comment
Amazing as always :)
I’m looking forward to the spin-off Youtube channel The Book of Intern!
THAT SIDE QUEST WAS TOO FUNNY!!!!!! You did not have to go that hard, but I'm so glad you did.
This is too complex.   I need them to slow this down so I can follow along.
I swear the mando pitch meetings always love to take time to do something else
This man single handedly just called out disney on all of their bullshit writing, the Illuminati is gonna come for him.
Moff Gideon coming back made sense because he was sent to prison, not dead.
100% spot on!! The intern side quest was true Mando! 😂
Genius! Comedy peaked right here  THANK YOU RYAN
I LOVED SEASON 3!
The cutaway to buy creamer actually really made me not want to finish watching this, and then I realized that he just pointed out that joke and I started laughing at myself.
This episode was really good!
I’m glad there was no ad to destroy the flow of the episode. The format really doesn’t work with them.
Yes sir I do😅
So glad I stopped watching this after their political firing
Somehow Moff Gedion Returned.
I wish I watched this first before the actual show. Would have saved so much pain.
HEEYYYYYY! That toilet wasn't filled with turds!!!! Bait and switch is tight.
Why does everyone avoid calling him Mandy.   I don't get it.  Even pitch meetings.
I hope we see more of intern guy.
That BS of a season was worth it since we got this legendary pitch meeting as a result.
Can't do an andor pitch meeting cuz it's perfect
Okay you perfectly captured the way the season was written! Draw out every plot point and focusing on the random side characters
"This is the way!" "Oh, that's tight!" "Yeah yeah yeah!' "AMAZING!"
I love how I knew exactly what joke he was making the moment that he pulled out the red hat😅
The stretching they did was unbearable so I skipped season 2 and 3 entirely.
Intern Quest
Never ending fetchquests are tight ! This is the way, I have spoken 🫠
Pitch 'Love Actually' please.
The stock footage part was the hardest I've laughed in a while.
Using a lot of stock video was super easy, barely an inconvenience ! This is the way !
The ending is cherry on top, great banter, Ryan
Trying to drink my own cup of coffee while watching this Pitch Meeting was a terminally sincere exercise in exciting nasal expulsion of said coffee.  Having said that, we are still waiting for the PM of the original Highlander movie.   Again, thanks for all you do, Mr. Ryan.
Did more customers ever come after the great toilet unclogening?
Curiously more enjoyable and relevant than Mando S3.
I ain't never watch no Mandy Lorian and I ain't never gonna watch no Mandy Lorian.
Do a pitch meeting for the menu puss in boots  Toy Story 4  The last of us  Winnie the Pooh blood and honey and how to train your dragon
That store was really out there
Replacing a male lead with a boring mary sue how exciting
love it!
This is so wrong!!! Lol 😂
The side quests in these Mandalorian pitch meetings are tight!
every Thursday I'm excited because I know a pitch meeting will be    released😃
Beat pitch meeting yet!  So accurate!  Lmao
Watching Ryan learn about the concept of B-roll footage and use it for several seconds in the middle of a side-quest is super easy, barely an inconvenience.
That was actually an extremely compelling side quest. I was screaming out loud when he finally got the coffee to producer guy. It was such a satisfying ending with such masterfully done buildup
Holy F you went ALL THE WAY!
Ok, all jokes aside that cameo at 2:44 blew my mind. Wasn't expecting him to feature in this for such a minor role.
Singing lizzo lizzo lizzo lizzo lizzo to Christopher Lloyd is tight.
Wow, outdoor shooting, new actirs, ScreenRant is giving Ryan more budget.  Giving more budget is tight!
I hope when you do the pitch for Andor, you will bring up why on earth they used humans instead of droid to build stuff, when they had infinite hydro power to keep the droids running, and humans required way more effort to be looked after. 🤔
The sidequest of intern guy getting coffee cream for producer guy was really funny.
Holy...moly.... We are in the actual background :O
So THIS is the beginning of the Pitch Meeting Cinematic Universe. XD
_"We're Disney, watch everything we make, or... we'll turn your kids Trans"_
Well done Ryan, well done 😉👍
Annoying tf outta fans is super easy, barely an inconvenience
You've got amazing talent. These are tight scripts, staccato editing, and high quality observational humor. You have a strange mind, and I thank you for sharing it.
I can’t wait to see more of Intern and Other Intern!
That side plot was amazing. I love Pitch meetings but I've never laughed this hard before at one before. I really hope we get to see intern guy again
Having another Star Wars bait and switch is tight!
Should have ended season 2. Perfect ending.
Watching every thing on disney plus is TIGHT
Clicking on a video to watch the main character only to be stuck watching a sidequest is EXACTLY how I'd  expect the mandalorian pitch meeting to go
Commenting early is TIGHT!
That side quest was wild!
I'd really love to NEVER see the intern again, just to keep the point
I came for the Mandalorian Season 3 Pitch Meeting, but I stayed for the Epic Cream Quest of Intern Guy  And now that I've typed that sentence, something has awoken in me.
I... almost... skipped this pitch meeting
Intern Guy is the one side quest I’m OK with
He had a side quest. 😂 I can't stop laughing
Or you could kill the other intern character for the cream coffee.
This episode was amazing!! 😂  The whole thing with the intern and especially Jack Black and Lizzo had me rolling on the floor…
I like this. Yes, this is good. I would extend my kudos to the creator.
Sign me up for the Intern Guy spin-off series from Pitch Meeting+.
Side quest are…..Tight!
Footage of Japan? Bahaha.
should do an andor pitch meeting next
Getting Producer Guy’s coffee was very much an inconvenience
Oh, sidequest stories are TIGHT
The side quest was epic! 🤣
i enjoyed the car commercial
The intern detour was a genius parody 😂
This is the Way.
wow wow wow....   ...wow
Early
I feel bad for anyone watching only the Mandalorian and are confused when starting season 3 not knowing Mando and Grogu were reunited in a completely different show
If you see this hope you have a good day
The intern will proceed to become a fan favorite and appear again in a distantly related disney pitch meeting only to be abused and reused until people stop finding him charming and start finding him annoying
Oh boy, interns are TIGHT ...
Ryan uou are such a clever sonovovich, I can’t help thinking you’d make an amazing screenplay-show with your skills buddy 😊
“Liked at sudden sidequest”
Love the side story, such a good job!
“Smithers, I’m beginning to think that Jon Favreau is NOT the brilliant storyteller I thought he was.”
I can feel the hatred in this one 😂
10/10 vid, really expanded the Ryanverse. You have convinced me that Disney's producer guys and writer guys did nothing wrong
Over the top! It was super easy, barely an inconvenience?
I was really thrown off and annoyed with the fetch quest tangent that seemed unrelated to why I clicked on this video. Then I got it. 10/10!  :D
I really liked Seasons 1 & 2. Not so much for Season 3.
First
I'm gonna be honest, I skipped the Dr Pirshing episode
OMFG you did a side-story within a side-story within a pitch meeting about a show that's basically just a bunch of side stories
Love the fact that this video is basically mando season 3 with totally unrelated stories 😂😂
Alien and aliens pitch meeting
Maybe we should have the main character be the main character of their own show.  Such a great idea!!
Pitch meeting should have its own series on Disney.
I got bored with the show, at least I can enjoy the recap. Pitch Meetings are tight.
Developing characters is... Super hard and a considerable inconvenience!
Well shit you know how to make it work when you swap out who is the main character. Disney needs to hurry up and hire you lol
Not only did we get a patch meeting we also got a side quest from the new interns
Oh my God - there's a world outside of the Producer Guy's office!!
Watching the Mandalorian season 3 pitch meeting is the way !
Ryan you sir are a treasure never leave us😅
This seems familiar. It's like something I've seen before...oh right, every other garbage Star Wars product Disney has put out.
I would like to see this Intern Guy more in the next pitch meetings.
I hate how accurate this is!!!
Pitch Meeting lore drop goes crazy.
I won't stop asking you must pick one: a baby seal,puppy or a cat or hamster or a Honey Badger? Btw. I admire your work and passionate narration from Croatia-Europe
PA sidequests are tight!
God i missed your content so much 😅
I was waiting for this and boy it did not disappoint this was better then the actual show
"maybe we should have the main characters be the main characters in their own show"   that sums up Disney
“Why would we….that wouldn’t work” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Unexpected and new plot twists are TIGHT!
Please do a pitch meeting on: #1 - The Room #2 - Birdemic: Shock and Terror #3 - Battlefield Earth
Side Quests for Coffee Creamer is tight
Ngl this season sucked
The pitch meeting side quests make more sense than the mandolarian pitch meeting. 😅
new characters on this channel is tight!
I thought the intern thing was setting up a sponsorship ad for some sort of delivery app so I started skipping ahead
YES,YES,YES,YES,YES
Frist
I love watching mandalorians take tight baths
Lol
😂. Loonnggg, loonnggg journey to a bath.
So funny how he immediately goes into interrupting…him, to adresss Grogu.  What EVERYONE is talking about
This is The Way. Super easy, barely an inconvenience.
Season 1 and 2 better than 3
Love the intern gag here😂 Disney just can’t stop making main characters become side characters in their own shows/movies
Side quest during pitch meeting are tight.
0:28 This is pretty much the best way to describe Disney.
oh side quests are tight
Yes
I liked Season 3.
Super Easy, Barely an Inconvenience!
"Important baths are tight!" Truer words have never been spoken.
Hitting play as soon as the notification appears, super easy barely an inconvenience
Having nothing else to do in your life but watch pitch meetings is tight !
I would love to see the pitch meeting for Austin Powers
Important bath are tight
263
watched this instead of the actual show 💀
Woo new vid
Let's redefine "slow burn" as "pointless with no pay off"
I'm honestly surprised you didn't do the 'I wanted to write an Andor episode' joke like you did in the Boba Fett one.
I love the side quest in this video much more than the side quest in Mando season 3 lol
OU EST MON GHOSTBUSTERS 1984 PITCH MEETING????
Man I was waiting for this... But to be honest this season sucked.
First Pitch Meeting over 7 minutes in a long time, great 👍🏻
That is one of the most cursed thumbnails I have ever seen.
I love how no "spoilers ahead" in the opening cus he knows nobody's gonna see this.
Yeah, i couldn't do season 3. Just couldn't.
Next pitch meeting on Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero 🐉
I’ve been waiting for this for a long time
another day another pitch meeting
So fast
....
wow 26 seconds ago... got here early, thx for videos ryan always makes my day :)
Woop woop!!
Hi 🎉❤
You're awesome! Keep those videos coming!
Yess
first
Love the vids
I loved that they reunited Mando and Yoda in another show to do absolutely nothing with it the entire season.
Watching a pitch meeting>>>>watching over 8 hours of TV
Pitch Meeting is better than any Disney show or movie.
First comment
First bitch
So, you've got a dropoff in quality for me?  Yes sir, I do!
Super easy....
hi
Another show I've never seen just the pitch meeting.
I like cheese.
Hello there
First!
NEW PITCH MEETINGS ARE TIGHT
First!!!
The lad
😎👍
Just in time
Yas!
