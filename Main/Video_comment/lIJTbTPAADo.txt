😂😂😂😂
Steelers raped yaw lmmfao
We need a “umm” counter for this mf
plz take care of him
Welcome to the Bears, Mr. Claypool. I think I speak for most fans when I say it was awesome to hear you were coming to Chicago.
As a Steelers fan I hope you guys can get him going l! Much love chase ty! ❤
How often do you get to turn a 2nd round pick into a guaranteed WR2 at worst and likely a WR1?  That's not a bad trade in terms of risk vs reward.  Draft picks are always a roll of the dice.  A lot of 2nd round guys don't pan out.  They desperately needed a legit WR talent.  Good trade in my mind.
Too bad you went to a team where the QB can run for more yards than he is capable of passing for.
happy for ya bro, finally have an intelligent coaching staff and a promising qb to receive from.  learn from what ben and juju (surprised bears didnt snag him too) and others have taught you and youll be fine! good luck
Him, Mooney, Kmet & Montgomery are gonna be deadly together, can't wait to see it 💯
Man I'm gonna miss this dude I think him and Justin gonna be explosive together
Goodbye luck Chase ,  Steeler Nation will miss you. Thanks for being there for us as we were there for you.
I hope you ball out in Chicago claypool. Longtime Steelers fan /: we’ll miss you
Madden 23 auto updated. You just converted a two pointer. Yoooo
We already shut him down in Pittsburg sure we can do it this weekend
You're going to be missed Chase. Good luck and success in Chicago man!!
LMFAO ENJOY THE TIKTOK CLOWN TY 4 THE DRAFT PICK CHICAGO 😂😂😂
Welcome brother BEAR DOWN 💯  Glad to have on board 🏈
Make plays last longer
Loved you in Pittsburgh but good luck in Chicago
I pray the bears do so well this season and low key make NFC championship. I am so glad Fields is maturing because I definetly didint lke his rookie smug attitude but now he's growing up even more so thats awesome!
Welcome to the team. Good luck.
I’m sick at this trade. We should’ve kept Claypool on the outside. Put Johnson in the slot. I’ve always liked Claypool. He plays hard, but he was still developing. I understand the second round draft pick is needed but damn man….
Hopefully he becomes da 🐻 Bears go 2️⃣ guy❗
Steelers fan here. Sorry to see Chase go. Congrats Bears for getting a good receiver. Hope he works out better for the Bears than he did the Steelers.
Pittsburgh made a big mistake trade-in this kid.   Should have traded Kenny Pickett
As a Steelers fan. Claypool is a stud. He is a great big play receiver. I think we should have traded him because we were not using him to the best of his abilities
go bears
I was coming to Pittsburgh Nov 20 th. I was most excited to see Chase 😪😪😮‍💨😮‍💨😪😪😢😢😢Nooo But I wish him the Best and know how awesome he will be.
Miss you Chase, from a Pittsburgh fan!
Welcome to Chicago where receivers & quarterbacks come to die lmfao I feel sorry for you bro
Chi-town take care of homie.  He ain’t from the hood.  He from Canada.  Make sure he don’t go to the south side and don’t blast him.  No scraps in front of McDonald’s head office
Look in the mirror and say goodbye career!
Hello your in Chicago!!!  Nothing happens in Chicago football!!! The bears still suck !
Lol sportsball
Who?
As a Steelers fan we didn't utilize him well the last 2 years with our qb issues. He should be a pretty decent player for you guys. a lot of upside with him. sad to see him leave
If you want the truth about him here it is. He doesn’t run good routes and he doesn’t use his size to win one on one battles or make the contested catch. He doesn’t have the “want to” to be what he COULD be in the NFL.
So we traded for that one guy who is notorious for making dumb plays and isnt a number 1 receiver. Cool.
take care of him. from most of steeler nation🫡
The Bears won this trade. Draft picks are never guaranteed.
The worst blocking WR in the game.
I hope he takes advantage of his second chance. wish him the best.
Please make plays Idk how much more losing I can take
Pure class from Chase, good luck man.
big loss, i'll be rooting for you Pitt isn't going anywhere.
He will ve missed in Pittsburgh.  Go Chase!
Honestly, what's not to like about this if you're a Bears fan. He comes at a relatively cheap cost this year, it gives Fields more options, takes pressure off Mooney to be their #1 and may give him more chances (like when Robinson was their #1 and got all the DB attention) and he's got old teammates/other players from his alma matter on the team from his college days at Notre Dame. It's almost like a coming home of sorts for him (yes, I know he's from CAN). Sounds like he welcomes any pressure to perform, yet knows that expectations are tempered at this point so all he needs to do is contribute to what has thus far been a lackluster performance by the current WR group. 🐻⬇
As a long time Steelers fan I am letting Chicago know they're getting a good player.  IF he is used right,  throw deep to the man.
Welcome to Chicago now Let's Go Brother!!!!!!!!!!
Steeler fan here, his “immaturity” is way over blown. He’s a lot more mature now then he was in the past. Steelers play calling was ass, he should produce in Chicago with Fields
You run a 4.4 but it doesn't show on the field, why?
Why do you jump 4 ft in the air but catch the ball at your waste? What up with that??
You play like you 5'10 180 lbs but your 6'4" 230..what seems to be the problem? Can you ever get seperation!
Excited to drop balls maybe!
Lol ur problem now Chicago
Waste of a 2nd pick imo. This guy will be gone in a year or two...
It’s energy but it’s not that Anthony Miller energy you feel me? It’s like chilllllll haha Bear down
I think this will end up being an absolute 💯 % match made in Heaven 💪🏼💪🏼  Fields and all his old ND buddies will make the transition easy and as he alluded to, this will open the offense.  The defenses will really be in a bind trying to keep the running game in check while dealing with Mooney, Claypool and Kmet.  They need to draft an interior D-lineman with their first pick.  Those guys can set up your whole defense !!
Now let’s get Quentin Johnston and get this party started
You’ll be missed in Pittsburgh mapletron best of luck
As a Steelers fan you guys got a guy who can be a huge threat when used properly look at the eagles game last year when Big Ben found chase in the end zone 3 times
He's a good Man I think he'll do well in Chicago as a Steelers fan I hate to see him go but I  will follow the Bears to keep with him All the the best Chase Claypool
Bears fans I hope y'all enjoy a 6"4 wr who plays like a 5"8 wr who has brick hands and can't make a catch without falling. Hopefully he can develop into a star but I don't see it.
These were kind of some fucked up questions to ask him. "Why do you think they traded you?" Like dawg cmon be more respectful to the man
can't out battle my granny for a jump ball , good luck with this soft dude
And we’re excited to watch you make those plays
Brick of hands good riddance
ND. DA BEARS! Let's Go...
GOAT
Really looking forward to seeing what Chase can do in a Bear uniform, very excited #🐻⬇️
Love you 11 you definitely will be missed in Pittsburgh and maybe come back some day
Welcome to Chicago
BEAR DOWN!! 🐻⬇️
Welcome To Bears Nation!
Awesome job by the front office finally got a stud that can still grow and help us he's gonna love it here watch let him get other important things in order 🐻⬇️2023 is around the corner!🍻
Articulate and wise (to the idiocy of the media).
Like his cool -- doesn't feed the media gremlins after midnight.
Let’s fucking Go
Welcome to Chicago. Look forward to seeing what you can bring to this offense.
Likable guy and well spoken
People don't grow up til mid 20s usually so i usually forgive stuff like what he did when he was younger, you can tell hes older and wiser now
Its best for both parties. He gets a good opportunity to prove us wrong and we get a good 2nd round pick. He just didn't fit the culture of Pittsburgh, but I hope he does good.
Coming from a steeler we are gonna miss you man. Hope you ball put up there🤟🏼🙏 wish you nothing but success
I'm just hoping my bears use him in the way they should...welcome to shy Town chase
It hurts so much
Watchout as he is lazy and is terrible at adjusting his routes to coverage .... from a steelers fan
For anyone talking crap does anyone remember he got 11 tds In 16 games I'm 2020? 4 Tds in one game against the eagles ?
Easily the best Wr on the bears
Thanks for the time with the Steelers, Chase. Good luck with all your future endeavors.
You'll be missed 😔 thanks for the memories  and may God bless..
Best of luck Chase! Will miss you men!
He’s matured
Honestly, I did not expect the Bears to make these kind of moves this season. From all the rumors I've heard about the front office not liking the Fields's pick, to Nagy's stubbornness to use his skillset, I figured this would be a "Let's make some play-calling changes and see what we have" type of season. It's good to see them add Chase Claypool, I am not sold on N'Keal Henry due to his health, but I hope his addition helps is what's needed to have the Bears offense be a competitor deep into the game
Will miss chase he looks more happy there
im upset we gave him up i will be rooting for you go have a big year there still time i know you will excel in chicago
Will will all miss you
He’s a deep threat for sure but we still have a problem with the line not giving Fields enough time to lay up a 30+ deep ball
He sure didn't make plays in Pittsburgh for the last 2 years.
Eberflus is gonna looooove the tik toks
We the north!
Good luck Chase. Lots of love and support from Abbotsford.
Love you chase were gonna miss you
You bears fans got a good one fr
Bruh.... what the Bears and the new GM are doing is AMAZING work. They basically gave away Quinn and Smith... for a 4th and 5th round pick, TJ Klein, and Chase Claypool. But its not just what they got that make it an A++ but its the reasons.  Quinn was old, and only had 1 sack(unlike last year where he broke the record) and this is a rebuild to have a young, contending team in 2023 and/or 2024. So quinn wasnt going to be apart f the picture anyways, so might as well get something for him, same goes for Smith, not to mention Smith wanted 20mil?!??! for a LB?!?! No thanks, def not worth it. In return they aded to an already crazy number of draft picks, they got a BEAST WR in Claypool, who by the way had one more year before the Bears have to pay him, so gives us a year during the rebuild to see what he can do. On top of all the draft picks, they now have a cap nearly over 140mil!!! Not only is that the most in the NFL, but its more than double the cap space the team with the 2nd most has....  With all those picks, and Cap space the Bears will be able to work on the OLine, and pick up a bunch of STAR players in the draft, and from FA and trades.  oh yea and the Bears only have roughly 5 players over 30years old, one of which is the kicker Santos who isnt going anywhere.The new GM is doing this rebuild RIGHT! By 2023 and/or 2024 the Bears are going to be young, hungry, and deadly. Not to mention Fields has been playing like a beast, and the offense has been averaging 30ppg in the last two games!
Damn dude I already miss Chase. Bears you got a good player.
Bruh is a monster!!!!! Let’s GO!!! BEARDOWN
Alright Getsy let’s see how you stir the passing attack up with Mooney & Pool 🥲
Has anyone watched the film on this guy?  I'm a Bear fan living in Pittsburgh. Claypool is a #3 receiver. Has all the physical attributes but just doesnt make plays, drops balls, and seems clunky with his large frame. Watch all Steeler games and he should have made an easy catch this year on a deep route that Kenny Pickett thru a beautiful ball and he ended up creating a turnover due to lack of hands. Then against Miami another beautiful ball thrown to him and trips over a blade of grass Miami gets an easy pick. Pitt was ready to move off him and we gave them a #2. Would have rather held onto that pick because and tried for a solid number 2.
W
He’s such a good guy, cannot wait to see this man on the field.
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH LETTSSS GOOOOO🐻⬇️
Steeler nation will miss you Mapletron 😔 Hope you get the chance to glow and get the credit you deserve. Take care chase.
As a Steelers fan, I'll always be rooting for you Chase. Good luck in Chicago- many of us are going to miss you in Pittsburgh!
Bear down or lay down 💪🏾.
Even though a extra 2nd rounder is great, this is hard to watch ,not just because of the loss but you can tell it devastated him.
I was so upset when we drafted kmet over claypool that year. But ay kmet will get rolling, and now we Got My Guy!
I know why they moved him. He wanted music played at practice. Just like you Bears fans said just wait about Mitch I am now telling you the same lol. Good luck.
Thanks for all you did for the steelers! I hope you have a great career with the bears!
Seems like a genuinely great guy and has a positive energy about himself. He will be a great culture fit and someone to build the locker room with.
He look like a young Herman Edwards lol
Pittsburg was too. Just only happened once in a blue moon
Let’s goooo 🐻 ⬇️
The Chicago mapletron. Justin fields and chase claypool aka mapletron.
Chase Claypool is going to be Dangerous I am glad he is here
Chicago got a good player

him & fields bout to ball out
The best thing for his career.  Good luck .
Don't let the door hit you in the ass ... Bum.
First time I have ever heard him speak. Very likeable charismatic young man.
As a Steelers fan, I will miss you Claypool and will keep an eye on you and wish you the best.
Chase played great and aggressive at times but he also played lazy. Maybe he'll turn out to be great if he wants to ?
Got a reason to watch the bears now😢
These reporters suck
Love The Quote “ He Needs A Play He Can Come To Me “ 💯
Welcome to chicago chase claypool
You’re a class act dude! Good luck (except when we play you).
part of the same agency yep lets keep that brand at the forefront.  Chase the Khardashians won't be in the stands in Chicago either you know that right?
Love you chase have fun with the bear gonna miss u bro
Hope u guys use him the right way GL -Steelers fan
Beardown. GoIrish
Good luck Chase, hope you blossom into the most you can be.
Welcome Chase!! Bear Down!!
Let's Goooooo
Im very excited about Claypool, I was pissed that he got drafted by Pittsburgh one pick before Kmet. Pace should of moved to get him. Put him back outside and were good!!!!! Excited to see how he develops he is a monster and only getting better! 6-4 230 lbs
Makes sense he's in Chicago has a Jordan deal as well hope he does well
Let's GO!!!!!
Best of luck to you Chase
Man, I'm so happy he is here...
Mapletron, you will always be a Steeler. You have a great amount of potential and are with a young offense that also has a lot of potential.
Coming to a team that actually will put your talents to use can be great motivation. This is the equivalent of getting a second round pick with a few years experience.
he sounds like Braxton Jones. even his facial mannerisms are similar.
I think he has incredible talent and needs to get the ball more than he has.
Love this Guy what # he's going to wear
Yes we got another receiver..I...
Anyone else hard?
The Bears got a very good reciver with great potential. Good luck Chase.
Welcome to Chicago! 🐻 down
Fresh start for him. Rooting for him.
As a Steelers fan, I think we are going to take a MAJOR hit by letting this kid go.  Godspeed Chase and prayers for the best in your future.
The Bears have a really good young receiving group. Claypool, Harry, Mooney, St. Brown together have a lot of talent.
Never watched a presser of his, seems like a super nice Canadian dude. I don’t know what his character issues where but hopefully he keeps this up. Whoever wanted him to play slot should be fired though, this guy is an X through and through
He is probably thrilled to get away from Matt Canada
😢 dayum hate to see you go chase!! But I hope you ball out and prove that Pittsburgh messed up because that’s how I feel, Matt didn’t know how to use you and your skill set
I think the Bears got some serious talent at WR. If N’Keal Harry can stay healthy and develop, they can be in business. Fields has got some weapons in Harry, Claypool, Mooney and maybe Pringle when he’s also healthy. Can’t wait to see 🐻⬇️
Best of luck to Chase Claypool
Mooney, Claypool, and St. Brown is the most stacked I have seen in a while❤❤❤
He and a former Bears quarterback had a pretty good connection. Hope he and the current Bears quarterback have the same type of connection.
Who’s this guy?
I wish Chase Good luck.  He made some big plays for us, but has been a terrible route runner (of course Matt Canada runs a terrible offense) and made a ton Of mental mistakes. I hope he have success for you guys.  A second round pick is a lot for him. I was stoked to see that. I thought we wouldn’t get more than a 4 at best. So I hope this is good for both teams. Good luck Bears. Please beat the Packers. The Bears are ok, and I hate the freakin Packers.
Winner!
People dont get this dude can be one of the best, and super dangerous, No offense to the Steelers, but he didnt really have the best QBs or surrounding talent to really let lose, and go off. I think this will be his chance to show everyone what he can really do.
Excited as a bears fan. Young weapon with a good amount of experience making plays. Great pick up. We got an upgrade at the position its going to be fun to watch
Welcome to Chicago big man 🐻 👇
Clay pool to the bears let’s go
Seems like a good guy, humble yet uber talented.  Hope he does well.
these r awful questions
He with the bears
Chase is on the case! Looks sick in a bear sweatshirt 🐻⬇️
Dope add on... his football receiving mentor is Brandon Marshall... If Brandon has coached him up to give us even 75% of what Brandon gave the Bears, this will be a damn good move
Best of luck with your new team Chase. From a Steelers fan.  Ow start posting on YouTube again.
This is what Justin Fields need on that offensive line, hopefully he can be a big help on the offense for Fields. Claypool can be that deep threat down the field. Fields is awesome with those deep ball down the Field, he just need a receiver that will jump up and get the ball.😉
Welcome to chitown chase!!! 🐻⬇️
Now let's get this offense going Claypool u and Mooney can destroy defenses
Gonna miss him lowkey
As a Ravens fan thank you Chicago for getting this mf'er out of our division. One less issue to worry about.
Welcome to Chicago!!
I put together a video of all of Claypool's routes ran in his big week 6 game against the Bucs, Check it out if you're interested
Clay Henry moony kmet Pringle Monty Herbert is a nice lil combo and fields looking better let Henry play and mix sum plays for velus we will be dangerous I'm more worried bout our defense now they better build that BK up asap
A smart articulate young man as per usual from my Alma Mater Norte Dame. I think Mapletron can do big and exciting things for our Chicago Bears!
He was my favorite player sad to see you go specimen you will be missed on the Steelers roster I was happy to see you play in2021 vs the ravens!#11
He seems like a good dude! I hope he does amazing for himself and for the bears, especially Justin who needs help!
Seems like a good young man.  Wishing him well with the Bears, and look forward to his catching passes from Fields.
All of these questions were terrible felt like it was repeating the same stuff and NONE of the questions were decent
Welcome aboard.  We finally have a number 1 receiver, which is great.
At best a wild card with this pick up 😭😭
What kind of questions are these, geesus.
Top 3 in the league, lfg
Somebody ask him if Cole Kemet will make some plays now...
Very lazy WR lol
Can't wait to see him play!  I was hoping all year we could get a trade done.
+
Mapletron😈
Best since B Marshal no Best since Curtis Conway Bear Down
feel like he dont wanna be here
The Bears are making some Great moves!
"Why do think they got rid of you??" My god, some of these questions are dumb as hell. Chicago media is atrocious.
Chicago: he's on the record when asked he answered, " a guy who can lead, a guy who can work hard and a guy who's happy to be there."  This is a change from; social media extraordinaire, a tik tok superstar, "wanting to be a top 5 receiver in the league" (as stated pre-season 22 goal).    Good Luck Chicago!  (Dude is happy to be in the league, learned real fast what kind of business is this NFL).    As one of my friends who played Tight End, for another NFC team once said, - "It's a MEAT MARKET".   I see all you stiller fans that are supposedly upset; don't be - dude disappointed.  Chase to CHI will be = Mitch to Pitt.  "They are who we thought they are!"
Let’s go!!(FNF voice)
What number is he going to have?
Gonna miss him. Chase I wish u the best young man.
Can't wait to seem him in a Bears Uniform scoring his first TD. HE seems locked in and eager for a fresh start. Hopefully my boy capatilizes on this new opportunity
As a Steelers fan, it's gonna hurt watching him make plays in the Chi.
Stoked is right
Why are they trying to throw so much shade at Pittsburgh?? They trying to get chase to talk bad about them.
I rather see Claypool and Harry  out there and moony in the slot
We are very happy we got a weapon like You Chase.
Mooney and Claypool on the outside with Pringle in the slot is going to give opposing defenses fits in the near future!!! Can't wait to see this thing come together!
🐻⬇️FAM
I hope he has a great career with Chicago. The Steelers most definitely didn't know how to use him..Good Luck Chase ✌️💯✌️
We really needed a solid wide receiver, don’t get me wrong I like Mooney a lot but chase claypool is going to do something for is.
I hope you Bears fans don’t turn on him like our Steeler fans did. Y’all got a gem here. The ceiling is high for him and if anything else he will be one of the most consistent players on the team.
Looks like he has a positive attitude and open mind about the move. I hope he settles in well and helps Fields, Mooney and himself.
Welcome to Chicago 🥳🎉🎉
he looks sad lol
Claypool loves tiktok and social media more then he does football.
His problem in Pittsburgh was maturity right? So why do his answers make him sound so mature? I guess we'll have to wait until he gets on the field.
Finna miss ya Chase! Stay you bro, you're gunna kill it....
This will be a great help to Mooney and Fields .because this kids can Catch the Damn ball. Welcome Clay let's get to work.
ND connection.
Welcome big dog!
Go Canada! Welcome Chase!!
I am absolutely thrilled that he’s here considering he was in my mock draft a couple years ago!! I love it and hopefully we can keep building this team to win..
My only question with trades of Quinn and Roquan, and the addition of Chase Claypool is: "Why didn't Ryan Poles make these trades when he traded Khalil Mack?"  The 2022 NFL draft was a deep one -- and delaying those additions accomplished nothing. Well, better late, than never.
I think with the way fields throws the deep ball and the lack of other weapons he’s gonna have a big season next season and whenever he gets the playbook down this season
Just found out last off season he said he's top 3.wr in the pafl. Let me clear my throat. His feets get jumbled pass 20yds. I think he lacks pro level hand eye foot coordination. Good luck chiraq
Steelers cut him cuz his football iq and attention to the game lacked and if you want a video example watch a video titled Tony Romo drops truth bomb on chase claypool and what Romo said was dead ass right running routes wrong which is why he diddnt get open on the play in the video 🤣🤷 aye as a Steelers fan no hard feelings there loaded at wideout bears fans better hope he hits the playbook harder then he did in Pittsburgh good thing is bears have em for another 18 months so they have a little trial period with him n if he continues to run incompetent routes than bears know where to go from there 👍👍
Claypool will be a good fit with Chicago Bears and with  a good team mates on this Bears locker room. Luke Getsy has an offensive scheme that will make Claypool an explosive WR / blocker weapon for Justin to throw to down field. Coach Eberflus communicates well to his players. He gets back to his fundamental's of a WR and learn Getsy's play book, connect with this Bears teammates Justin Fields, Mooney, Kmet they will play well together to get more wins the end of this season and this offense becoming explosive on the field. Chicago Bears fans we should be excited for this addition. Hope he works out well and stays out of making wrong choices when he is not playing football and plays well he will do well here. Kmet can be a good influence to Claypool who played together in college. It will be nice to have extra players they can use depending on their opponent and when they start to double team receiver's.  Luke Getsy I am sure is going to use them all and find the right position for all of them that brings wins in his offensive scheme.
Welcome to DA BEARS
this is a weird sight to see but i think this is going to be huge for fields
Well he seems professional and excited to get to work. Like his personality. The gridiron will tell
hell yea baby!!
Bears yall may be onto something....yall got a good one from a Steelers fan
Will miss you Chase & I honestly hate that the Steelers lost you (and it's damn shame we've had such an inept Offense that made it sooo difficult for anyone to truly shine on a consistent basis), but the real fans know you already have everything you need to be elite and we did see big flashes of that! I believe you will continue to grow & put it all together and I'm excited you are getting a fresh start...definitely cheering for you to ball out in Chicago!   Bears fans, I know many of you already know this, but ignore all the outside hate. It just made sense for us to trade Claypool from a contract/rebuild standpoint, but the vast majority of us (not the obnoxiously loud, idiotic, pessimistic "yinzer" fans) know how good he really is & that he probably still hasn't even come close to tapping into his full playmaker potential that you all will hopefully get from him. I think the 2020 version was the purest version of Claypool's ability, and that was just the tip of the iceberg. I think 2021 and what we've seen so far in 2022 are mostly a result of a totally incompetent OC, gross misuse of Chase's strengths & not scheming for them, & overall just a really young Offense/rookie QB going through our first MAJOR transition in 20+ years? Anyone outside of Steelers Nation that is hating is probably just jealous their team didn't get him. Oh, and all of the media hot takes about his "immaturity/attitude/diva issues" or whatever else—I think that is just the toxic media doing what they do to stir up drama and get clicks. I genuinely think CC has learned from his past mistakes & has shown nothing but leadership & accountability in every press conference I've watched him do this year. All that being said, you guys got a real one! Please treat him well & I truly hope he thrives with you. I've never had an NFC team that I truly root for on a regular basis, but I've always liked the Bears & think your franchise is similar to ours in some ways. So looks like I'll be cheering for you guys as you go through your rebuild as well! Best of luck. 🐻
Welcome to DA Bears Chase Claypool bears down 🐻
Lol finally someone with energy.
Welcome Chase , Chicago is lucky to have you, BEAR DOWN
Yall treat him right cause Matt Canada didn't
MapleTron
Gonna miss you bro, I wished we drafted you and we did. Hope you have a great career with the Bears my Man...
Steal. There is not a wr in the second round of this years draft with his talent. Now use the picks on OL and DL. Let's go.
Who's going to throw him the ball tho?
Hey Chase, how does it feel to be traded to another dumpster fire?
This is cool. Hopefully he'll be an asset. From his track record, this just might work
This guy right here is 6’4 240 pound workhorse of a receiver. A nice big body that can go up and get it. He’s got tight end size and strength but is a WR. This will help all facets of the offense, to blocking, to stretching the defense so others can get open. He forces your attention. This trade is way better than the media is playing it. There aren’t many strong WR in the draft so why potentially waste a pick on a rookie and instead went out and get somebody that’s established himself as NFL player and shows tremendous upside. 10/10.
So upset he is not a steelers player no more
He will be amazing for them as a Steelers fan hurt to see him leave but damn he deserves to shine and be WR#1 or atleast the opportunity to show he can be
Sucks to see him leave … will be watching and rooting for more bears games
Fearless Forecast: 20 rec 205 yds 0 TD's...and a whole lot of histrionics!
You can tell he’s a little sad about getting traded
Looking forward to Pickens getting more targets. Dude catches everything. Also looking forward to some next man up energy in the likes of Sims, Boykin and Cody White. Addition by subtraction!!! So hyped for the 2023 draft. Good luck, Claypool.
Welcome to DA’CHI
chicago is where receivers go to die.
Such a great character. He’ll break out into a whole new level playing in this new regime.  Feels great to be a bear 🐻
Excited to have this dude!
Bears keep making WR go crazy 😂 Steelers gave them a lot of WRs through the years
Welcome to Chi-town, time to ball out!
Clay pool isn’t really crazy good or anything but I do think he’ll be the best receiver for the bears and I think he’ll do well over there
Ball out in Chicago young fella!
MapleTron! Welcome to Chicago!
He’s gonna be great I think this change is gonna do him well… Welcome Chase 🐻🔻
Love the trade rather gave up ravens pick but to each it’s own. But I love the move especially since there’s literally no upcoming great WR in free agency and I still expect us to draft a WR in draft. Just hope fields survive the year with horrific offensive line
“Obviously you have some familiarity with Cole and Sam, what did they say about playing in Chicago?”  😂 Please don’t ask Sam what he thinks! “They were 🎉 when I got benched, and 😡 when Patrick got hurt and I was put back in…”😂😂😂
Welcome to Chicago Mr Claypool, we’re super stoked to have you!! Let’s freaking go!! Bear Down!!
Big W
Loved you at ND ☘️, was glad to see you get drafted to my other favorite team the Steelers, but now I’m excited you’re with my Bears. WELCOME ABOARD CHASE! 🐻 🔽
Glad we got him because we’re bidding against the Packers for him, they also offered a 2nd round pick but took ours because they think our own 2nd round would be at a better position in the draft, so I’m glad we got him….
Dynamic Playmaker I love it I've been a fan of this guy since his rookie Season Glad to have him on the bears🐻🔽💯
Chicago media…Do better!!! Terrible!!!
He has no off the field shenanigans, NFL fans are lazy with "headcase" and "diva" accusations for every receiver the media doesn't slurp. This guy doesn't drop passes often, scored playoff td's, 1.5 years left on a rookie deal, he was the best wr available for a 2nd round trade.
Lets Go Bears!!!! Sad to lose RS but hyped to have an offensive weapon like Chase on the team.
I was hoping the cards played.. umm how they played. Wow lol
welcome 💪
Some of these questions being asked just made me go WHAT?! Like “why do you think Steelers traded you?” Bro! That’s a question for the Steelers FO, why ask Claypool that? Were they trying to fish a “I’m the 3rd fiddle so they traded me” out of him or something?
This kid is a Justin Jefferson type talent I’m telling you just watch and see
I wish nothing but the best for my dawg chase🤝🏾
Lets just hope he makes plays, and buys in.
LETS GOOOO! 🐻⬇️
I was talking to my boy right after Smith got traded and was like we need a young big receiver Claypool was the first name I said. Next day we trade for him. My inner GM was glowing 😂😂
Steelers fan here, chase was great with Ben just look at his rookie tape Justin fields should do well with him best of luck Ps. Ur welcome we didn’t trade him to the packers lol
Welcome to Chicago mapletron 🐻 dahn
Would Justin Fields be like Jalen Hurts if he had the support?
LFG BEAR DOWN!!!
Love the addition of Chase!!! Real potential to be WR #1. Very intelligent young man.
The tape never lies... he is going to take this offense to another level...
Bust
Man I love this, it made me sick seeing steeler fans hyped he’s gone, y’all gonna be sorry AF when this dude shows what he’s truly capable of
Finally got fields some help 💯
Media has tried to make claypool seem like a clown but honestly seems like a really genuine, well spoken, good dude
Let’s get it C.C!!
At least he looks happy
We have a young core let the chemistry begin.
No wonder he was good his 1st 2 years. He was on the outside. What the f would the steelers put him in the slot?
The media trying so hard to get bad press on pittsburgh
Welcome bro, let’s get to work.
I hope it works out for him cuz he had maddening potential and that was it
Dude sounds like a carbon copy of Braxton Jones
Lets hope he focuses on beating green bay more than his jewelry and hairdoo. He is another diva lets hope he pans out.
I can’t say this enough!  It’s 2022 fix the f’ing sound system….I hate when you can’t hear the questions
GO BEARS 🧡💙🏈🐻⬇️🙌🏾
Happy to have you chase!!! This year might be lucky but just hang in there tell next year, gotta lot of draft picks and money to spend
Best of luck Chase! Hope you find a home there in Chicago! Steeler Nation✌🏽❤
I miss this man as a Steeler already
ND 🍀
WELCOME TO CHICAGO
Wow welcome to the Chi Chase Claypool!!!! BEARDOWN ✌️ 💯 💪 👊!!!
Let’s goooooo!!!
I knew nothing about Chase before he signed, other than I'd seen him make some excellent plays for the Steelers. Having seen the interview, what a great personable guy he seems. First impressions count for a lot and he's made a good start in Chicago. Really looking forward to seeing how he and Justin can hook up. Great signing in my opinion, and well worth a 2nd.
All we need is for you to get open and catch the ball. Yes, be a team player but at minimum catch the ball. Remember what you said: " if we're winning I can do my TikToks at the end of the game"
Welcome to the Bears Chase!
It was hard to give up #11 but gotta do what you gotta do? #10 then
2:17 I like that confidence 😎😁🐻⬇️💪🏼
It's time to cash $$$ in the MOONEY with CHASE bank!
Good luck to opposing defenses trying to stop Claypool, Kmet, Mooney, and of course Armstrong
Chase jersey Number is 10…  DeAndre Hopkins: WR Houston and the Cardinals Tyreek Hill : WR Chiefs DeSean Jackson : WR Eagles, Santonio Holmes : WR with the Steelers and Jets all wore #10  What y’all think of the choice, Fitting or nah?
he actually acknowledged his "learning experiences" meaning he's learned from his dumb choices and things he's said. I like that.
ND baby!!!!  LET's Go Bears!!!!!!
Wait a minute they put claypool in the slot!?! Why would you put a 6’4” WR with serious speed in the slot? No wonder his numbers are down this year after two really solid years.
Bears gotta steal !!!!
The Chicago Bears a Playmaker Wide Receiver I can't wait too see him on the football field in Bears jersey Making Plays deep catches
Best weapon we had at receiver since Brandon Marshall
Chaaaaase!! Welcome to Chicago big boy!! You and Darnell are gonna do so much with Fields, and we're all excited. 🐻👇
That’s 3x ND guys on offense, wow
I’m so happy, I watched him and Kmet play together in college and I loved watching both of them. Now watching both of them in blue and orange is going to be awesome 🐻 X ☘️
Got 4 notre dame starters on the offense now
LETS GOOOOOOOO 🐻⬇
Prove the salty Steelers and Packers fans wrong Chase.  We know you have the talent, and with a new team can really thrive. No more nightmares of Noodle arm Ben, or whatever subway worker the steelers think is their next Qb
Let's go I'm happy that we have Chase claypool let's see what he can do
Are first weapon on offense.
If he buys in to what the Bears are building, he’s going to be dangerous
Helll yuhhhhh first one to ever comment on claypool As a bear he’s gonna be a beast
