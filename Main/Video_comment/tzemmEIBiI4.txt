I think hes high 😂
Let’s see…. You are here to find the comment done by Andrew Garfield.
why does he sound soo wise 😌
I love Andrew Garfield even more now than I did before this video. ❤
no matter where they are, even in the middle of an alien invasion two English folks meeting up will always feature a cup of tea. ALWAYS
Boys can try his skin care cream.
Weleda products are no good at all, link with anthroposophy and Steiner's cult. Careful.
About table tennis, I feel the same, playing table tennis makes me feel happy to be alive 🏓
My forever crush my handsome man
He’s our spider-Man

1:01 rip mom
I love Andrew Garfield too much (nah there's no such thing XD)!
He lowkey fine
Andrew would have fit right in with the 60's counterculture!
I couldn't love this vid more. Hilarious
im sooo attracted to him, but I personally find him very cringe he keeps laughing its like shut up!!!! and also the overthinking is that like his schtick now? I dunno he's hot and pretentious imo
That moment when you're on a youtube binge and you realise Andrew Garfield is your male alter-ego #surfing #darkchoc #booksuitcase
Why does Andrew with beard and that moustache give Christian Bale kind of vibe? 😂❤
Andrews hair needs to be studied
Best skincare on the planet. Listen to him!
A mirror, a beard trimmer, and the rest is a very oversized EGO X8.
Bro forgot the web shooters
Okey I don’t need to know the rest he’s a cool guy and it’s a big mistake for not making Andrew third Spiderman movie.
RIP TO HIS MUM 🙏
Just when he couldn't get any more wow, he reveals reads Wade Davis....yum.
This is my tipe of men, please universe bring me an Andrew Garfield-kind in my own life please🧞‍♂️😢
Also the fact he knows about carvers is so awesome - best longboard
My lord this man.
I am convinced that if Andrew hadn't made it as an actor he would have somehow become a hippie (I mean this in the nicest possible way bc hippies are rad but also he just gives off the vibe of someone who would have become a hippie but has too much money to be considered one)
I’m actually a bunny, if he’s ever in the market for one?
I need him.
love the fact that he didnt want to advertise the last product
OK, now how do I reverse falling in love with him?
Why do surfboards look like dolphins and sharks? That seems like impractical design and possibly dangerous.
i love him so bad
10 Hobbies Andrew Garfield Can’t Live Without
It is kind of nuts that humans have learned to ride the waves of the gravitation pull of the moon. Like, surfers are just tiny little James Webb Space Telescopes riding a luna lagrange point. Love that.
It's just 9 minutes but I'm in love.
He’s even got the shroom shirt 😂
He's wearing the same pendant in the latest chicken shop date episode with Amelia. Seems like that this compass guided him right into her arms.❤
I believe the compass necklace is from a brand called Pyrrha (Vancouver).  They have many more beautiful wax-seal looking designs of many different meaningful objects.
That surfboard is incredibly gorgeous; I get it.
I need to know how the woman who played Bananagrams on a plane with Andrew is doing after that interaction.
“…it’s sort of like, beautiful solitude.” 🤤
I Was Heard and i Was forgot Like Bro...Now i Was liked bro😊❤
Andrew is my only genuine man crush. I'd give anything to be friend with the legend❤
With just the way Andrew talks about his mother’s ring and the compass necklace that his friends gave him, he seems like a man with a great emotional intelligence which is very rare to see.
Am I the only one that wants to know about the mysterious titleless and coverless book??? Been around the comments trying to see if anyone saw it but I haven’t found anything…
Was i the only one that read codenames condoms??😂
Peter Parker likes to sirf, skateboard and read books ❤
~ I’m shy ~ I’m very introverted  ~ when I was younger I skated ~ I’m humble Me and Andrew could be friends bc we have a lot in common 😅 (Even tho he’s 26 years older than me we can pretend he’s not)
the beard is hits different
I love him so much
He's a funny guy! ❤
He sounds like he’s gonna off himself one day to be honest :/
HES SO FUNNY HELPP THE NOISE HE MADE WHEN TALKING ABT THE SURFBOARD
i love him so much could listen to him foreverrrr
5:20
5:19
number 11: His real life Gwen Stacy AKA Emily Stone 😢😢
It’s nice to see someone with actual hobbies and interests. So many dull ‘celebrities’ come on here with just their phone, some aftershave, a bag, etc and waffle on. Can tell some of this stuff actually means a lot to him
Why is he so handsome?! Bruhhh I love this man
Never liked him in a movie but in real life he is incredible.
on droogs now!
I love the Way He Talks. Really Genuine & Simple. Now a Days It's very hard to find such kind of People. These Qualities makes him stand Different from Others Celebrities. I Pray to God to Fulfill all his Wish.
if this was made in 202/13/14/15 he would have said emma stone :}
Andrew is hot, funny and happy 😃
How is he 40 😂
Love this guy
I love you daddy
I always forget Andrew is a Brit
He is essential to the human race
I never knew he was such an enlightened hippie…I like him even more now
he’s so remus lupin coded
The best Spider-Man out there🙌
Can you imagine sitting next to Andrew Garfield and being asked to play Bananagrams!!?!? Omfg i would be so excited 😍
My crush has only intensified watching this video 😂❤ but no seriously I loved hearing his stories and wisdom.
Call me Andrew i like you a lot of you a epecial man
He's 40
Enis Arıkan sandım kapaktan amk
marry me pls
He has such a beautiful aura
Okay hes definitely microdosing during this interview as well lol
I take my paddle everywhere I get it.
wow I hate him so much after watching this.
Okay, what was the book they edited out?  No cover art, no title and it just went "beep" and wasn't there any more.
Andrew Garfield is Really ' The Amazing Spiderman ' in Real life , In short ' He & the word Amazing are one  '
I hope I find my Andrew Garfield someday
If Andrew Garfield asked me to play Bananagrams with him on a plane I would suffocate
god i love him so much lol
He really is a Leo man
hes so
Spider Man
Jai Shree Ram
My Spider-Man ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
I\m a huge fan of AG. I love Weleda too, books, dark chocolate and quinoa snacks. Cant wait to see your next movie. Thanks British GQ for coming up with this brilliant video. Love it.
Weleda..man...he is great
I mean. I just love this guy! Don’t have nothing more to say here!
I'm calling it His racket is a Timo boll ALC, Butterfly Sriver (red) and yasaka mark v (black)
am i the only one who thinks if there was ever a movie about Christian Bales life.. Andrew could play him.. maybe its the beard, but.. idkk.
sorry andrew
7:07 ur beautiful
SMASHHHHHH
hes a hottie 👍🏽
he should have a yt channel <33
a table tenis? no way
Where's Andrew now? 🥺
Best one I've seen! Big fan now!!
The whole books section is just Remus Lupin behaviour, actually--  Edit: OH MY GOD THE CHOCOLATE TOO-- I can't, it's just so Moony of him😂
Neither of those are boardgames
for anyone wondering. i think the necklaes is from Twojeys. i could find it on there Webseite tho so maybe i am worng on that one. they still make cool stoff.
now I know he didn't become famous for no reason.
It's Timo Boll, not T-mobile table tennis racket. The subtitle is off :) 2:46
maybe dont show us most of the 10 things at the start of the video, makes it a little more enjoyable imho
One more Amazing Spider-Man!
Bro cant live without emily stone
Heck yeah. 100% agree about books.
Cruiser, not skateboard
it's weird because I came on to this video by chance, and here's Andrew talking about how when you're lost you're on an adventure that will take you places you never imagined... Isn't it funny how sometimes the universe gives you clues and messages via someone who has no idea who you are, and yet you manage to connect...?  Thanks, Andrew for being a compass. Even if you never see this, you helped me today.
Impriman más de esos
Weleda is so great!
I love how he actually found a deeper meaning behind the products he was promoting (like with the “specific brands of chocolate” lol), and how by the end he pretty much ended up admitting it yet made it hilarious anyways .
https://youtu.be/pPP4Ui_2d3Q BEAT BLUE bettle
This is my Spiderman everyone.
He just enjoys life
Bro came and delivered
Gross  stopped liking him
I’ve never realized this before but Andrew’s accent is such a perfect combination of English and American. Like you can definitely hear in certain words that he was raised by parents with two different accents
I never thought someone could talk so deeply about granola 😍💀💀
i just wanna get high with my lover...
10 things your mom can't live without   1-my D!©k
Books and chocolate give me Remus Lupin vibes, but another side his behaviour and appearance it’s definitely our good neighbour friend Spidy  And Andrew himself is very comfortable person🙏🌺
I like how he laughs he he heee 😂
I still feel sorry for what Mark Zuckerberg did to him 😢
although I am a raging lesbian, there will always be a part of me that is in love with this man
Unfortunately, i haven't watched any Andrew Garfield movies. Im definitely adding that to my list👍 He is hilarious and entertaining. Love him!
It is so surreal that I met him yesterday at Superhero Comic Con in San Antonio.
Jean Luc Picard 👆🏼
When I'm in apathy, I'm lying and I don't know the meaning of life, I watch the video with Andrew again, his positive literally pulls me out of the bottom every time.
03:48 One day, I want AG to say that about me.
I need a man that has his own paddle!😅
what's up with that fake raspy voice?
Fun fact: Andrew was actually high while doing this interview
Why has no one edited the scene hes holding the surfboard like "this is something im riding" to be a pic of themselves 😂😂 that seems like the AG fandoms type of thing
Guys, I'm tired of liking all these positive comments about Andrew. I guess I'm not the only one in love with this man. 😂💓
I just get drawn to this man. I know hollywood is a world of make believe but he just seems like a very genuine person.
he is just the most well spoken, sophisticated, and down to earth, this is why he's my favorite person ever along with my favorite Spiderman
Interviewer: What are your 10 essential possessions?  Andrew Garfield: table tennis bat  Interviewer: (okay maybe he just like table tennis)  Andrew Garfield: SURFBOARD  interviewer: (maybe he’s just into sports)  Andrew Garfield: banagrams (tells story about shrooms)  Interviewer: ….
The editing on this lol
Next we want emma stone
1:17 when he said this he meant the rest of the ppl on the illuminati. Think about it…
He is probably the closest famous person to have normal mornings and days
omg i love this man
7:32 And there is our Remus Lupin, ladies and gentlemen
its the chaotic energy mixed with brightness pure joy and calmness for me. 10/10 would fall in love
i like to think he is actually filming this in the middle of the desert
THE SHROOMS😭
For anyone wondering, the book they cut out is "Walking in Wonder: Eternal Wisdom for a Modern World" , by John O'Donohue
Normally don’t watch little alone comment on these… but saw that he really likes books (that’s refreshing) …Andrew seems like a very relatable, down to earth cool guy who anybody would like to hang out with.
Rabbits really are the best creatures. <3
I like 40 year old stoners now
“Part two we’re married 😁and the mother of my children😅, that’s not true 😔”
Hope he gets to try beast bars if he likes dark chocolate
This is the least conventional 10 things I’d bring and I love it. Like freaking banana grams what the heck
Number 11 - Emma Stone
seems like a chill bro ngl
~ He likes to read. ~ He's humble. ~ He's shy. ~ He's an introvert. ~ He's quippy. ~ He skateboards.   *He* *is* *just* *like* *his* *version* *of* *Peter* *Parker* 😂
2:46 the evil laugh😭😭😭😭😭
Can’t live without him ❤
I want to play bananagrams with u
This guy is the most interesting person on planet earth.
I love his beard!
this is just petet parker with an accent
well andrew u definitely sold me on that chocolate and granola 😂
HE’S SOO FUNNYXHXJIDISKSKKX 😭😭
[p^
omg yessss the quinoa crunch dark chocolate is AMAZING.. andrew knows what's up!!
you were literally on a plane everyone was high af
this man has zero personality, 1/10
I want to know more about his favourite chair...
These celebs and their friggng moisturiser!
Watching this video is really a joy. He conveys pretty good that it is the small things in life, that keep us going through life on daily bases and acknowledging these things will give us a smile and the joy of life, even though we might haven’t find or ever will find the meaning of it❤️
Does everyone in Hollywood have lip fillers
he makes me want to become a better version of myself
To be that surfboard!!
Oh, to be a surfboard and sleeping next to Andrew. 😮‍💨
Does anyone know the maker of that surfboard
This was such a pleasure to watch! I could listen to Andrew Garfield talk for hours! Thank you British GQ! 💜
remus lupin.
I get him
Why didn't he whip out a TASM2 suit
I love Andrew’s spiderman,n wtf,,with those accent?is he british?or his dad?mom?
He's Overrated!Ughh
Alter Eco chocolate has added sugar too
Andrew you're missing out. That's actually  a cheap pre-made racket.  Yes 150$ dolar racket is a cheap one in tt. Buy your self a timo boll alc blade with two tenergy 05 rubbers and some water based glue than you'll be in heaven...
We can move forward gracefully.
is he high
He’s got great hair and charisma
Hair transplants and finestiride.
Still can’t believe that this is the same guy who missed out on “The Amazing Spiderman 3” launch just bc he failed to inform he was down with fever. But then again, losing on such film and covid must have taught him a good lesson. Glad to see him become a better person!
Skincare???? Yes we love a king that takes care of himself
He is one thing I can’t live without😂
Loving how this fella is connecting to his roots, the land and honouring it through his purhcases instead of promoting shitty brands.
“What is real life?”
Silence and Hacksaw Ridge are really great films. I still enjoy watching them.
Wait so he was on a plain high asked the stranger next to him to play a board game with him and now that stranger is his wife? Or is that a joke story?
I don't know you or what you've been through, but you matter. God loves you and so do I. Believe that Jesus Christ is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead. Repent of your sins; repent simply means to turn away from your sins, don't keep doing the wrong things you did in the past. Be baptized; a symbol that the old sinful self is gone and a new creation is here in Christ Jesus. Follow the specific will of God for your life and you will be saved. amen
I used to think he was soooo cute. Of course he still is but he’s gained some weight going for the buff guy look and I like lean guys. They look healthier. Plus I’m not the biggest fan of the beard.
I don't how people can take drugs and gloat about it on YouTube.
stop, stop andrew,  you can't become more and more perfect every moment
#1: B'ussy
You can tell straight away how much of a stoner he is ahaha
1. Mary Jane
He is so cute,i cant
Missing Amelia on this list😂
Dq
i wanna be friends with andrew lol
Had zero idea Andrew Garfield was this cool, ngl I’ve had hate for him deep in my subconscious ever since the amazing spider man
How can you not love the guy
what a legend!!!!
Epic
I love this. Andrew Garfield is my spirit animal. I feel like I relate so much with him in his way of being, reflecting and vibe. Maybe accept for the world famous actor, good looks and doing shrooms too much though, lol.
#1 attention
learning about andrew’s chocolate addiction just makes me associate him with Remus even more
He seems more chill n at peace
Omg I wonder if the girl knew who he was
when he sniffed the books...... hes so me
This man has good taste in books
Why does he look Amish here?
Garfy you’re a surfer! 🤯🤯🤯
Ah I love that he loves weleda too!
Andrew Garfield is one of the most down to earth people. And you can even relate with some of the stuff from the video that you yourself do in your daily routine.
who knows the beat the the start of the vid
THE MOST AMAZING PERSON😂
his mothers ring🥺🥺💕💕
Amelia is missing
Never in my life have I heard people openly admit to taking magic mushrooms as if it's a good thing! Is it a fashionable thing now? The only people I know who have taken them got totally messed up and are now dead, not cool people...
oh my god im so in love with this man
honestly despite a euueieueuuuugh kind of vibe (flat) good for him for being so quirky and self aware about his spunsauhsheips
To u think that’s a real background or green screened
… So him and that woman next to him on the flight definitely had sex, right?
Do more andrew garfield videos
no ones talking about how he clearly is on shrooms and he geeks about stuff he really loves.. a true one this
I adore him a huge amount
Hero Fiennes Tiffin next please !!
Feel like he’s method acting rn
I can relate to your love of hard copies of books ! It feels special to hold one in your hands, turning the pages one by one, the smell...it's kinda therapeutic. I tried Kindle  or reading from my phone but it's just not the same.
Food poisoning from yogurt that’s unheard of
Will buy first class plane tickets moving forward in hopes to sit beside and play games with micro-dosed celebrities
Love his hair trasplant
I just can't stop imagining Andrew going apeshit without his extremely specific dark chocolate
Lorddd I love AG so so much <3
HES LITERALLY REMUS LUPIN  CHOCOLATEEEEE
Imagine playing bananagrams with Andrew Garfield on a plane while he’s on hallucinogens 😭😭
10 essential Cool Things was not the concept of the video
cutie
That felt like more then 10
PLEASE let me be 1 of the 10 things he needs
Ben Barnes and Andrew Garfield slowly just morphing into each other
Next time I see him: Weleda.
Anyone know the compass necklace brand ?
why the f do we like the same things, didn't expect that
Find me an Andrew Garfield-real life-version boyfriend, please!!!
he could so easily be a college boy forever i just feel that
When did Andrew Garfield get smoking hot?
I need to see him on chicken shop date lol
He's cute and cool and maybe took a hallucinogen before this interview...
can we all agree that Andrew is just another UK version of pewdiepie?
Now that is a personality
Another TikTok trend: 4:00
he's just such a treasure.
I need Jack Edwards to review Andrew Garfield’s book taste
Weleda an ethical brand ? Lol
and my love for him grows
he is absolutely high in this video lol i love it
He's so adorable like a very nice human. Talented too.
let's be honest he had some mushrooms before this interview
dude imagine being on a flight with Andrew Garfield and he asks u to play board games with him, that person must be hella lucky
I love Codenames. We are meant to be 🫠 don’t tell my husband
He's very grounded and very good with words! Love this guy!
I really thought that his face was photoshopped into someone else’s body on the thumbnail-
#1 being the werewolf
5:55 when he smelt his books I felt that cause I too am a book sniffer
I love Andy G. He is such an inspiration.
>>>
I love how he sniffed the books
I love this man
I love that he doesn't want to sell a brand, yet at the same time really wanting to get that specific brand of chocolate and flavour sent to him by the caseload. He has such a wonderful soul and spirit.
If I’ve learned anything from this video, it’s that AG has some dope friends!
This might be the best one. I love him so much
Me eating a yogurt*....😮
So handsome
I hope he knows I can’t live without him 😭
I do hope those brands send him many boxes of chocolate. The poor man needs a bar a day!
never would i have imagined that andrew does mushrooms
love that he loves codenames! It is such a good boardgame
I could listen to him say yogurt all day😂
Obsessed.
He busted out that Weleda. That stuff is *chef's kiss*
Andrew te amo 💖 💕 ❤️ ♥️
He just made all the granola girls wet
I really wanted him to say Lasgna was his essential item
Bro went from Brit to full Californian
I love him
Please make this series more authentic. If you don't allow for product placement, or don't let them mention brand names, or even just blurring out the company name, It'll incentivize the guests to only bring personal items. The series looses credibility with all of these specific products. If they like a certain skincare product, just let them bring it in a see-through bottle, and we'll actually believe that they can't live without cleaning their skin. It's not like you'll bankrupt the guests if you won't allow them to bring their sponsored items.
oh the way he described surfing
11. Jon Arbuckle
Maybe he was on hallucinogens here too ? 😅
Imagine Minnie Driver casually walks into your home for a cup of tea.
kind of obnoxious... not sure why
the daily chocolate....the remus lupin of it all
is one of them... amelia dimoldenberg
Wow, he's lovely. Very unpretentious.
i have only gotten high twice in my life, and i have vowed to never engage with marijuana again, unless its with andrew garfield would 10/10 get baked with this donnie
I couldn't stop smiling throughout the video, Andrew's vibe is so friendly ❤
A man written in the female gaze
Omg, this man, I mean, uff
he seem like the most fun, loving and chill person ever 😍
hes f**king great haha
I’m in love ❤
Andrew has such a beautiful soul. I wish he was my friend, feel like that would be a connection that would be really good and fun in my life
"  I microdoses mushrooms" - next thing you know he has a book about hallucinations in his pile 😂
his products are giving rich ecologically conscious frat boy but then mixed with his English existential charm I don’t know what to do with this
“It’s not like theater it’s not going anywhere” hahahaha omggg Andrew
this man is positive chaos
The unabashed microdosing story 😂
I love codenames!!!
My favourite "10 Things I Can't Live Without" interview. So chill and down to earth, no luxury brands (except for maybe the ring, but the story makes up for it), just good quality every day creature comforts.
A recent study found out that Alter Eco and Hu (to of MY favourite dark chocolate brands, too) have high levels of heavy metals (lead and cadmium) in them, as do most dark chocolate brands....actually all 28 dark chocolate brands tested by Consumer Report had some heavy metals, but 25 of the brands were above maximum levels allowed in California :(((
he trying to look like jake gyllenhaal
🥰❤️
Legend!
The person that played Bananagrams with Andrew Garfield, you had your chance. HE WANTED YOU.
i love andrew and everyone on this channel but this really goes to show that human life is completely meaningless
Lo amo
odd question, but can someone tell me the brand/make of the shoes in the thumbnail of the video (left hand side). thanks!
All of these videos have the vibe of the actors being given ten things to advertise having never seen them before
I LOVE HIM. the granola tangent, so cute
First time I've seen a stack of books yesssss
everyone else: these are items I carry with me like skincare and beauty items andrew: look at all my hobbies!
Andrew Garfield himself has impressions that he going to teach Miles Morales how to swing and kick some as*es, 3:06 i mean look how he flips that granola bag pretty sure he still got some "tingle" thing in him
what brands were the chocolate? Is it only in Europe or the US too?
that funny sound he made at 4:06, made both my cats jump lol
why does he sound british? I thought he was from the US
Spiderman Man on  🍄.. now we need to see that
he’s such a tripper 😂
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH
We love you andrew🇮🇳
i love him
He looks like Shindy in this video
Hi i em ur fen
I love this man with all my heart<3 Of course he thought about the brands!
I want Andrew to treat me like his surf board
When he said “There is no such thing as a casual game of ping pong” it was Facts, you ain’t even gotta be legit just be a decent amateur for it to get serious 😂
Yes! I have the Butterfly Table and my custom Butterfly paddle ( I hold Pen Style) agree, there's no real "casual" game of table tennis here
i love how he tells us why everything is essential . He’s so beautiful i love this man so much
omg
He looks like Scott from keeping up with the Kardashians.😬
I'm waiting for Tobey Maguire to do this thing🗿
Where is THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN 3?
THE LAUGH 2:46
Bruh why when the camera went side to when he was explaining bout that skate board I fell just na
Man Andrew I’m sorry for the lost of your mother, I never knew, love you man ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I never really got the appeal of Andrew Garfield, but he had me at Codenames.
When He Make A Wave Action The Camera Makes A Wave Too
Andrew Garfield is Absolutely Trash
Andrew Garfield uses Sriver on both sides.
The mushroom comment made the rest of the interview make so much sense
“Now we’re married and she’s the mother of my children…….that’s not true”
where is this? looks like the 14 passing through santa clarita
he talks like i am writing my essay! i love it!
Hacksaw Ridge ❤
chocolate?? he really is remus lupin isn’t he
This guy sounds like he is full of sh!t.
This feels like he forgot to bring items, and so they gave him random stuff to use and he’s making everything up lol
Every time Andrew Garfield speaks for some reason I think he is British.
That hair transplant did him right.
At first I thought the thumbnail was of Simon Cowel
Dude isn’t afraid to be open and vulnerable when expressing himself - gotta love it
No Spider-Man Suit?
Shouldn't #1 be Gwen Stacy? 😉
He looks like an elf😢
Ugh! To have a man like him!  He’s so charming and funny! I love him!
The amazing Spider-Man 3
who edit this segment is golden. Andrew G was so chaotic but so philosophical.
this mf 🤣
Lovely dialogue 🤍
4:07 Another meme material. Thanks Andrew😘😂
His moon being in aquairius makes a lot of sense to me
He IS the female gaze.
He is so sexy 🌝🙏💟
How many microdoses  before this interview....LOL
I'd love to talk to the woman who played in flight bananagrams with him 😂
Andrew Garfield looks like a mildly successful YouTuber
Weleda gang. 🤙🏾
TASM 3
And Now we knw why Andrew Garfield was Meant to be Spiderman aka Peter Parker.
i'm today years old when i realise garfield has an english accent
This guy is so charismatic and wonderful to listen to
god this man is fine
As someone who came from a family game night household growing up, carrying board games is definitely up my alley.
No gaudy watches, no keys to his sports car, no designer handbag, no creed aventus... wow, somebody who actually shares the things that tell you about them. Usually celebs just use the opportunity to brag about their more expensive items and you end up knowing nothing more about them after watching the vid. i will say i usually do enjoy hearing about the watches tho lol.
i swear if andrew sells out my favorite weleda moisturizer i’m gonna throw hands
I never realized until now but Andrew and I share a habit of getting really tangential.
With the mushroom tshirt, he might be actually selling hallucinogens
I didn’t know he was British 😭
"this is something i've been riding on for a while, it's elegant and beautiful, like, this one sleeps next to me"
Something tells me that him and Jaden Smith would be great friends
This dude is as hippy as they come.
How can you not love this man.....
he got his hairline fixed
imagine ur just on a flight and fking high andrew garfield asks u to play bananagrams w him 😭
He’s the most attractive, charming, wonderful human being walking the planet. I wish he’d marry me
Bananagrams and codenames are some seriously good friends and family games.
this is to funny
Now I really want to go trippin with Andrew Garfield.
Pretentious idiot.
I love his energy 🥰🥰
i love this man
He does drugs.  I used to see him at such high credit.  Disappointed.
YES WELEDA SKIN FOOD!!! My absolute life saver, I use the big jar cos u just can’t get enough
im sorry.... for a fraction of a moment i thought this was a scrawny henry cavil. which makes me think... do you guys think Garfield could do a decent superman?
This man has more hobbies that me changes do well in life
i can already see a certain someone making a video about andrews books.
I eat that exact granola
my cheeks hurt from smiling the whole time
these are such normal yet special things ugh marriage proposal accepted
The skateboard looks like the waves, the surfboard looks like the concrete streets
Codenames is so gooood Oh, to be the person sitting next to him on a flight and have him ask you to play bananagrams with him 🥺 even if he's on shrooms 🥺
He’s amazing
when he smelt the books, i felt that
this just progressively got better and better as i kept watching~~~~~~~~<3
He honestly just feels like a fun, sweet person to be around.
Why didn’t he talk about those Kyrie 7s he has on the table. Is it because of the kyrie drama going on?
I love him sm 😭 his mind, the way he goes on tangents when he’s talking, the little faces he makes when he’s embarrassed he’s just so 😭
His beard is ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Is he micro dosing now? I mean…..🙃🤣😎
4:06 🤣❤
who’s the person who played bananagrams with Andrew?! Show thyself😂
How did you get this interview with him?
💙💙💙🙏✨
I have the same necklace as him🥹
Oh he’s gotta be in the next Spider-Man movie. He deserves his 3rd Spider-Man movie!!!  The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the best movie of all time! 🔥🔥🔥 because Andrew Garfield is in it! 💪🏽
You're reading Ocean Vuong!!!!!!!!! My respect for Andrew shot up a 1000 times!
I’m so envious of that random woman on a plane who played Bananagrams with Andrew Garfield while he was tripping
Honestly, if I was riding a wave, I’d probably channel Howard Dead too.
Banana grams! I knew I liked this guy
i just found this video somehow
jesus i love him so much…❤
i cant recall anything from this video
He is just 🤌🏻
He is so high I love him
That Wade Davis book is amazing
Pingpong and real books.. oh yeah!!
I love him
He get matured a lot, I almost cannot recognize him 😮
Me, eating my granola with raspberries and blueberries in it while watching this…. Huh? Hubby is that you? 😳😍
little does he know that the game Code names inveted a Czech guy named Vladimír Chvátil ❤️
loml
Andrew 💜💜💜
Having the same favorite chocolate as Andrew Garfield is a flex I couldn’t have seen coming
W
I forget he’s British all the time
Hakan Hatipoğlu american version
Andrew is just such a great person, it’s unbelievable. and I suspect that he microdosed some shrooms before this interview as well ha ha😂 every single one of his interviews is delightful to watch 🥰🥰  (also somebody please teach him the right pronunciation of the name Vlaada Chvátil because, as a czech, it really hurts my ears😂😂)
hes so babygirllll
🎉
4:07 that “Haaaaa!” is meme-worthy
TE AMOOOOOOOOOO
ima simple guy ok i c andrew garfield, i click.
no like. he's actually my soul mate im fully convinced.
lol did he just say he microdosed on shrooms
‘Granola generally is my favourite part of the day’ ‘I start to get anxious if I don’t have literature’ I feel so seen and understood 😭❤️
I……. Love it his man.
god i love this man sm
What is the music in the beginning
Spider-Man
Chap's hilarious haha
I love him
That lotion is a 10/10 choice. I use it every day, only thing that has ever gotten rid of my eczema. Literally putting it on at the moment
peace love andrew garfield
he got the wolverine look just  give him the hair due
He's so thoughtful in the way he expresses himself but he also got that unhinged chaotic energy seeping through the entire video and that's just fantastic ! The range of this man doesn't escape even his own self !
CHOCOLATE? ELE É O MOONY MANO
How about this: Andrew Garfield in a surfing movie?!????
God he looks good with a beard
So many thirst comments from women😂 hey it’s okay I know he’s a cool dude.
Pov: you ask Remus lupin what he can’t live without  5:20 7:30
Is that grey hair I spot? Is he becoming more and more attractive ? 🥰🥰🥰
I love Andrew so much from the bottom of my heart
I feel like we ll get a video down the line in like a year or so where he s talking about this saying: "Little did they know, I was on mushrooms"
I could literally just hug this man for hours and be happy as a puppy.
This Ad was well scripted
is he high in the interview?
isnt he stuck in the halloween store?
The next one do Tom Holland and Chris Evans
never thought i'd be jealous of a skateboard
He has aged like a fine 🍷.
this guy is 39 and has a full set of beautiful, stunning, excellent, glorious, fancy, splendid, superb, brilliant, outstanding hair
I wonder if @JackEdwards is aware of Andrew’s new stack of books
both of those games are fromm czech republic (my country) XD
Its nostalgic seeing Andrew even touch a board.
The perfect peter parker
Ok but Emma Stone's husband can't be half the man Andrew is 💔
i need a deep talk about life with this man
Can’t believe this man is gonna be 40 next year
Well, chocolate, books, board games, charismatic attitude, eloquence, AND thoughtfulness?? Well, ladies and non-ladies, here's Remus Lupin, you can't argue.
Bruh people show their expensive watches and he shows off his skin care cream... True legend
The man the myth the legend
zBNVDZ4XFEGIBzS$
HE LOOKS LIKE A DEEPFAKE WHAT IS THIS
TE AMO DEMASIADO ANDREW
He's one of us !! He smells the books !!
Don't think it's possible to not like this man O.o
Codenames is so fun!
Question why do all celebrities have one or 2 parents passing hmmm
oh my god, i never knew andrew could be so nerdy😂😂
7:33 how remus lupin of him to need chocolate
More info on board please 🤙
'the more lost you are the more of an adventure you are on" - Holy sh*t, did he just come up with that?!
comfort person
What's with the weird background?
"Is it essential? Absolutely not. But it does make me happy to be alive" is a quote I'm using from now on!
i love that andrew garfield is a stoner
I love he's describing something so simple as a skateboard yet makes it sound so profound
Codenames is reallyyyyy great game it is sooo fun to play and omg he plays ping pong?? We are besties idc
He’s so twitchy it’s annoying
Are we sure he aint on something in this interview XD Loving the beard
The sarcasm and honesty.  Loveeee it
I knew he was chill but not this chill
hoo he?
This is definitely the best one
One of the greatest people to grace this earth Andrew garfield
He is such a charm man...
Such a likeable guy!!
Ouffff I’m so into him,respectfully 💪🏼
se la mamo en un subaru
at least hes not a werewolf🤣
Weleda is truly fabulous
I love Andrew but he looks way better and younger without any facial hair
my absolute favorite human
This guy gives me hope, no idea what for but just hope
Codenames and bananagrams! You are our people, Andrew Garfield 😍
I still remember him in Sugar Rush 😅🙈
you feel like you riddin the wind WrAAAaaAaAAAAAAh
Why he look so funny 😀... And he always look so young and handsome
how is this man real
You can not convince me he is not rolling deep in this interview. Not just bananagrams he does high.
I love listening to Andrew talk about his mother. He clearly has so much love and respect for her. He’s such a gentleman so it’s no wonder why people thirst over him.
who
He seems anxious to me
I relate with her mom about the rabbits. If I'll have children, I hope they'll talk to me this way, even when I'm gone.
Seen them Kyrie 7s in the left corner at the beginning. Guess he didn’t wanna talk about balling😭
I love him your honor
ma perchè mattia faraoni sta parlando in inglese
ESTO ERA MUY NECESARIO PARA MI
everyone: the perfect man doesn’t exist me: yes he does and his name is andrew garfield
he is everything to me
He is simply the most specific type of guy, it's fantastic
This was VERY Chaotic.
I love you perfect and wonderful man 😍🥰
My god, he has aged like fine wine. But also, I could listen to him explain anything, or trust him to watch my drink at a bar
Rip To Andrews mother sending prayers and condolences to his family and friends sending prayers to you and your family and everyone GOD bless you and your family and everyone
i am in love with him
I need him
He’s a stoner, just like me.
It’s giving Seth Cohen
😍😍😍
Why he looks like giga chad in this interview
that specific weleda cream and codenames make me think we're homies.
See yall tried to hide this from me by putting it on the british gq instead of the regular one😑
He seems like someone you want to be friends with. A nice human being apart from being a good actor.
4:06
BRO WHO SAT NEXT TO ANDREW AND PLAYED BANANAGRAMS AND DIDNT TELL YS
I want to do mushrooms and play bananagrams with Andrew Garfield
Where is he? Is he on location or is that just a backdrop?
2:46 is why I love him
Being the same nationality as the creator of the game Vladimír ’Vlaada’ Chvátil, who’s Czech. If you put his surname in Google translator (which helped me write the last word of this comment correctly), you’ll hear the proper pronunciation.
Omg I just love him❤
Bro finally him .... I am going to buy the same things the reason is I can look 28 and be older
I’ll have what he’s having
I love you Andrew wonderful men
bruh i wanna smoke with this man
Why does that thumbnail looks like its photoshopped?
omg I thought that was John krasinski for a sec
No phone!!! No gadgets!!!  Andrew is something... 👏🏻
Andrew is quite clearly high as a f&£@ing kite in this video. Not surprising given that he admits to using ‘mushrooms’. Maybe he was giving everyone a taster.
sitting next to andrew garfield on a flight and then him asking you to play banana grams???? when is it my turn
Bless that woman who played bananagrams with a high Andrew Garfield on a plane 😭
What a charming guy!
Andrew for Bond
This is cringe
I remember watching The social network and seeing him and saying who is this guy I NEED TO KNOW
LAWD
Did the video editor from Hot Ones start a side gig at British GQ? lol what's the with the special FX folks
I have with my family and friends every single week boardgames night and Andrew I personally inviting you to join 😊🥰😂
wow Andrew Garfield is just the biggest dork and I love him so much
First episode without a phone headphones wallet sunglasses
I'd really agree about the Ping Pong Paddle. It's the most beautiful thing ever made!
I wonder why they didn’t show the kyries 🤔🤔
Reed richards???
I'm surprised one of his essentials wasn't a game of Werewolf.   GQ - please pass along this deeply needed app Share the Meal!!
You mean to tell me bro does shrooms? Niceeeeee😂👌
Where's the web shooter
I'm going to remember the compass story whenever I feel lost
just fell a little bit more in love with him.
woah i knew he’s fine but he’s FINE fine
he’s so charismatic, sweet and funny. i adore him ❤️
Andrew is turning into giga chad
Still waiting on The Amazing Spider-Man 3
Play 4:07 over and over and he sounds like a Pokémon 😂
He’s so nice and seems like a fun person to be friends with
4:07
spiderman
Smash
I see david de gea here
Hybrid accent lol
every time Andrew appears for an Interview, he provides us ultimate meme templates.
*PETER U FORGOT UR WEBHOOTERS!!*
I’m very envious of the woman who got to play bananagrams with him😂
As far as I'm aware drug are illegal. The camera man should have performed a citizens arrest.
I'm surprised andre garfeild likes oatmeal lol
I was wondering where this man has been hiding lol🤣❤
I get the feeling he may be on hallucinogens right now
The way he says yogurt I love him
This man can do no wrong in my eyes. Absolutely love Andrew Garfield!
Goat
“little did she know I was on hallucinogens” 😭😭😭😭
You know he’s a real book lover because he smelled the books 👍🏼
It be funny if one of the items was lasagna
andrew garfield's rizz is insane
he was high af😂😂😂😂
He he he heeeeee
I’m surprised he didn’t bring his web shooters as an essential
My fave role of his was in the social network, great in both amazing spider mans as well…if anyone can rec more of his films, I’ll be glad yo watch ❤
I love hearing his stories and how into the storytelling he gets. Very charming and interesting person imo.
8:12-8:17 is possibly the cutest 5 seconds ever, and coming from a 39-year-old man, no less.  “I don’t wanna sell stuff to people” gahhhhh why is he so lovely 🥰
So I couldn't stop smiling. I don't know it's like listening to a friend (not that I have any... 😩), it's so comforting. Love him.
This guy is three more inches of beard and a Volkswagen Microbus away from full Aussie surfer immersion.
He is so funny in a natural way. I adore him!
This man is so funny and has so much charisma. I don't stop laughing in the whole video, it's the best!
I can listen to him all day
"Is it essential? Absolutely not. But it does make me feel happy to be alive."
Cute
hes so chill
Little disappointed that he does shrooms
0:19 God's name is Holy Don't use God's name in vain Exodus 20:7  7 “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain
andrew garfield makes you laugh like a f*cking idiot and you wouldnt even know what is it exactly youre laughing at
1:09 I‘m pretty sure this guy‘s name is czech (or at least his surname looks like it) so the way Andrew pronounced it was so funny to me xd
i think he micro-dosed before this too
this only confirmed that I really want to be the mother of his children.
I started laughing when the chocolate came out, because he's literally the perfect fan cast for remus lupin
"Books are a feeling of home with me" - yes!!!!
You are amazing.
Krycí jména od Vládi Chvátila jsou skvělý!
i could watch him another 10 hours go through his stuff there is just something so nice about his voice and personality
I adore him. So precious and silly and sweet, and with a deep spirit.
I get so much w2s or harry lewis from the sidemen vibes from him. It's crazzzy .
Why does he looks so edited in the thumbnail💀
I love ya
Where are the web shooters?
carver longboard is meant to pump back and forth and keep speed without pushing for the record
I’d love to have a long conversation with him about life over tea 🥰
Imagine playing Bananagram with Andrew Garfield on a plane 😩
Can we PLEASE talk about that background?!? Like WTH?!? Is that a blue screen/green screen background or is Andrew filming somewhere and these people just willie nilly decided to travel to where ever Andrew is to record/video this?!?! Like, really.!?!?
andrew garfield, what a character
Why he keep pushing drugs. Drugs at Disneyland, drugs at the airport.... Lost all respect. Get help. Another Kanye crying for mommy 😭😭😭
Oh the beard is rly working for him, working for me
Can we get Tobey Maguire next?
love andrew!
Timo Boll !!! Nice !
Andrew Garfield is one essential thing I can’t live without
gq should do subscriber ten essentials where they bring a subscriber on the show and they go through their essentials
Is it just me or does Andrew look fake in the thumbnail
the way he’s effortlessly funny
Finally a non pretentious essentials item that celebrities actually have
could Andrew lived if he had never played Spider-Man
He’s like all The Beatles wrapped in one 😂
Did he get a hair transplant?
This is how Andrew looks after his 2022 vacation/hiatus phase. Must say, I don't like that beard. What's up with celebrities not wanting to shave recently? Are we still in quarantine? 🙄
Andrew dont have a strong British accent Does he grew up in USA?
He’s getting more handsome as he ages
Anyone else notice that he acts a little like ewan Mcgregor
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR YEARS
i can’t wait for what he said in that surfboard clip to get edited into something really inappropriate 😂
Do this with tom Holland!
“I grew up with aero wispas and twixes” where did he grow up cos i thought they were British chocolate
God I’m so in love with him
Imagine Andrew Garfield asking you to play Bananagrams on a plane while he is high on mushrooms….
Definitely one the nicest guys in Hollywood and a phenomenal actor!
andrew rambling about how much he loves physical books is so me coded
I love how he is both goofy and reflective. Joyful and sentimental. He doesn't seem to take himself too seriously but he enjoys thinking deeply about things. Seems like a he would be great friend. Didn't know he was a surfer, skater dude. Interesting to see his essentials!
What a dude! Props for the Watts book too 😊
“The more lost you are, the more of an adventure you’re on”  Man that’s good
he’s so precious
His hysterical laughter of embarassment is my favourite thing about this man.
I think I don't have enough words to say how much I love Andrew Garfield, for 9 minutes straight i had a smile on my face. Andrew is my personal happiness booster
Aging like a fine wine this man 🤤
Never seen or met anyone who surfs AND skates.
andrew garfield give me a chance PLEASE
he’s so particular…it’s beyond fascinating and makes me want to listen to him talk bout whatever he wants for hours on end
W human
Wow that’s crazy because his necklace is legit the exact one I have from the same brand
The goat has arrived
i want him
Oh to be that person Andrew Garfield played boardgames with on the airplane while he was on mushrooms.
as far as SponCon goes this was endearing AF
That guy so effortlessly fun and eloquent. Love him !
He's so awesome
Not that it matters, but I've always hoped Garfield is as nice in real life as he seems to be.
I’m a guy.   I wouldn’t mind. That beard is working for him.   That’s all I’m saying.
Bruh why am I not in this list
Remus Lupin starter pack
what charisma and so sincere. love him
Bro definitely micro-dosing rn
I started listening to and reading Alan Watts when I was 14. His words and messages flow so freely through me to this day. He can capture a very specific feeling and explain it so vividly. I’ve had some of the most beautiful and empowering epiphanies when devouring his work. Completely remarkable and otherworldly. It’s incredible how he makes you feel like a small speck in time; yet so powerful to exist in it all simultaneously. Truly magnificent! Bravo Andrew.
The best actor most underrated and I don't care u agree or not there is no way spiderman can have actor than andrew Garfield
Nowadays he’s always in a desert. I love him a lot.
Fr tho I would die a happy lady if I ever got to play a long  game of bananagram with Andrew Garfield on a plane. I wonder how it feels to be god’s favorite… 😢😂
Anything with Andrew Garfield I’m clicking! I love his humour! He’s so charismatic and very attractive
he's so Spiritual Bookworm Surfer Guy
whoever edited this had fun
after all that lying in interviews before Spiderman:NWH, I really can't trust this guy anymore😒
So hot mentally physically and spiritually UGH
Can we talk about how absolutely not materialistic this human is. So humble.
ANDREW ROCKING THE CARVER. YES!
remus lupin i see right here
andrew garfield, please write a book now !
This videos needs more views cmon guys
Obi Wan Kenobi vibes.
hehhe
Time to Google what bananagrams are and if better on hallucinogens .
Ages like a fine wine
3:39 For a second I thought that was a giant dead fish
He's such a pretentious knob the cringe is unreal
Andrew Garfield has become a hippie
was not expecting him to be such a dude
Oh, he reads Alan Watts
i wish i was something that you’ve been riding
Never thought I’d see a carver skateboard in one of the vids. yeww
He really reminds me of Californian culture
Bro makes skateboarding sound like an out of world experience lol.
He is as beautiful inside as he beautiful outside❤
Really one of those forever celeb crushes. Cute that he doesn't want to sell products, but I just added those chocolates to my Amazon basket. 😂
I could listen to Andrew Garfield talking for days haha. I lost my Mom close to when Andrew lost his. Hearing his interviews and how he talks about his Mom was a huge part of my healing process. He'll never see this comment, but thank you Andrew for being so transparent and honest :)
No one? Ok… here I go. Him casually taking drugs - what a turn off. 🤮
Andrew wants jack edwards part 2
i need a guided meditation with his voice i swear man
OMG 🥺❤️❤️
The granola part gote good✋😂
Chef's kiss to the video editor who chopped this together. Great pacing and interplay with Andrew's charisma and wit.
The goat
He needs to be interviewed by the internet more often.
So your telling me Andrew Garfield and I use the same moisturizer  That is so slay I love Andrew
He look like a really good smoking buddy😤🙂
Was my Spider-Man for all of my childhood and it’s good to see him getting the love he deserves now.
4:07 youre welcome 🤣
The way he talked about that chocolate tells me he was paid to talk about those chocolates 😂😂
I love this man 🥰 I love the admiration and love he has for his mother. May she rest in peace and keep looking over him.
Yes yes yes thank you!
He is so Remus
My man is wearing the exact same t-shirt he was wearing at the spider-man no way home interview if you pay attention imma buy that mushroom shirt!
Andrew Garfield is beautiful good lord😭
Mmmm he’s looking so beefy these days.
wholesome
The way he views the world is amazing and definitely a beautiful thing he inherited from his mother. It’s so refreshing.
he is so awesome
My boy Andrew really seems like a person you'd wanna be friends with.
I'm in love
HE HAS A BRITISH ACCENT?!
Im a little bit confused, is he really in the camp o ir croma? I love him smch
Look who's matured a lot lately. Still the same youth inside tho.  Nobody in this world makes me beam quite like Andrew Garfield.
LEGEND
I love this man even more now
That’s not Andrew Garfield. That’s Spider-Man.
Woah I didn’t realise he was chill like that
i forgot hes british
Peter B Parker
This man is a gift
i love every single thing andrew garfield speaks in. every. single. thing.
I think i just fell in love with Andrew Garfield… From HU chocolate (which im eating now), to Weleda cream (which i applied 5 mins prior to watching this), to those books, i may need to hunt him down and microdose.
I love Remus Lupin
This man is everything!!!!
the amount of remus lupin vibes this interview gives!! i love andrew sm
1:55 Oh to be that woman~
When Andrew is struggling to find the words on why he love physical books and start sniffing it, I get that
His age is like fine wine. He's very attractive and hilarious too😅❤️ I love him so much  One thing more about him He's so sensitive Shy respect others and so much emotions and feelings in him ❤️ I think he's introvert.
I feel like he's high for this interview hahaha
He is so open and articulate and an all round pleasure to watch with his great sense of humour. Also he has such lovely hands.
Finally someone who finds books important and not advertising his own beauty products.
The moisturiser is a must
The amount of love I have for this man❤❤
He's so chaotic yet attractive!!! Ahhh Garfield 😍
I BET ANDREW GARFIELD IS AN INFP. he talks like an infp.   edit: googled it and i'm RIGHT, he is an INFP!
HELLO GOOD SIR
I absolutely adore him with my whole entire heart, thank you for helping me out of bad times when u don't even know me❤
Not related to Seth rollins I guess
to play andrew garfield in bananagrams would be the greatest experience of my life
He's a ray of sunshine. Need to find myself someone like this.
This is what you came here for 4:03
Love how much he honors his mother. Never misses a moment to mention her, may she RIP 🤍
Table tennis, my man! Let's go!
IM GONNA THROW UP
This is the best 10 things video I've seen it's all his hobbies lol
Andrew Garfield and Dylan O'Brien have the same personalities
why does he speak like an intellectual artist
Love him. Such a joyful, sweet and funny guy.
He is 100% high while doing this interview
he forgot emma stone just kidding
that surfboard is so freaking beautiful
god he’s so breedable i’m melting
Wonder if he'd be considered for james bond. 39 seems like the ideal age, though he is a young looking 39 lol
He misses Emma.
Real life Peter Parker ✨
I would really like a book recommendation video by Andrew Garfield 😌
10 THINGS WITH JAMES MCAVOY WHEN
Genuine unlike NickJonas'
Finally, he's attractive! I've never understood how anyone could find him hot when he doesn't have facial hair. He looks 12 without facial hair, and scrawny, so it's super creepy that anyone thinks hes hot when he looks like that
i love him so much
Petition for Andrew to be named the sexiest man of all time 🤭😭 his personality is just 👩🏾‍🍳😘
Andrew Garfield should read Ecclesiastes. Religious or not, i think he’d enjoy it!!
fight me, but this is the best one!
The chocolates and the books really shows why he has always been the fan cast Remus
Andrew Garfield get's trippy... wouldn't have expected it, delighted to hear it.
Nick Kroll and now Andrew? Good grief I’m in love with this man!!!!!!! Don’t tell my husband! 😂
Anyone else notice the Kyrie ball shoes at the end??
Eu amei as escolhas de essenciais dele! 💞
Hi Andrew you know what you could do with that paddle
Never in my life did I think that I'd be able to say that I own the very same surfskate as Andrew Garfield, but here we are 😮😃 For those of you that might be into surfing/surfskating- this is a carver resin 31' Also Andrew is so honest and funny, this must be the best 10 essentials video on this channel.  Like Andrew my man can we go grab some granola and talk about the feeling you get when you're on a wave? 🤙
why are there kyries there lol
2:20 , 4:30 , 6:37 ^ It be like that    1:38 ^ He does drugs⁉️🤯
I love you
The man understands the love for books ❤
The man understands the love for books ❤
Andrew Garfield and Sean O'Malley have the same voice! Minus the small accent
he’s a west coaster trapped in a Brit’s body
So now I know some of the dumber stuff he spends his money on
He carries chocolate …😏
I'm actually Czech and I laughed out loud at how he pronounced Vlaad Chvátil :D :D
Oh, to play Banana Grams on the plane with Andrew Garfield. What a dream😂😂
Andrew Garfield is the only celebrity that I would 100% leave my husband for
His hands...🥵
the compass is, I don't know it's a reminder maybe that the more lost you are the more of an adventure you're on. And also maybe that's when you're into your true walkabout and you're gonna find things that you wouldn't have dreamed you would find!!!!!!!!
🪒
I would love to hang out with him, he seems to be so cool and talk about anything you want
He’s so charming 😔🥺
god andrew you are gorgeous but i like girls
i want this boy in my house
ANDREW GARFIELD YOU ARE SO COOL
He just seems like one of those celebrities that would be fun to chill with. Getting high with Andrew Garfield is on my bucket list.
HE'S SO COOL love the vibe
THE SHROOOMMSSS
imaging sitting next to andrew garfield on a flight i wanna be that girl
Christ he’s a hippy
My favourite Spider-Man.
Me looking for a Remus Lupin and chocolate addiction comment 👁 👁
ofc chocolate would be smtg Remus Lupin cant live without.
"I dont want to live in this world if i dont get to deal with these specific brands of dark chocolate " Remus Lupin 2022
BEARDREWWW
Legend. Please make tasm3
I love this man.
we need to have a movie with andrew garfield and robert pattinson. imagine how epic the press tour would be
Im so in love with him
I hope he didn't move to Montana.
it's been 84 years (of waiting for this to happen) - to find out andrew eating hallucinating mushroom hahaahah
He has and always will be someone who is so very beautifully crafted, he is Art to me, the way he speaks, his little laughs in between, his urge to put in his existentialistic questions in interviews be it in a humours way. He is a poet to me, a beautifully crafted masterpiece.
When you think that this beautiful motherfu… can’t get cooler and he just does it.
he loves Codenames!!!!!!! its official he would love me if he met me!!
What is he promoting anyway?
Imagine the girl who played banana-grams with Andrew Garfield and then he talked about her in this interview. She wd be dying by happiness
Well one item in and I'm crying like a baby! Also, freaking LOVE codenames!
What a treasure of a person ❤
I’ll say it. It’s very possible he sacrificed his mom.
The yoghurt tangent felt very existential crisis esq and I kinda relate.
🕷️ Amazing Spiderman Andrew Garfield you would to shave your beard
Me writing down the books and chocolate he mentioned while also considering surfing because I love the way he spoke on these subjects
I wish the Amazing Spider-Man 3 was made. We would’ve seen the final chapter of Peter 3
This is what I have been riding 💪💀💀💀
god i love this man so much, i love the way he explains things, you can see how much he's interested in them. he has such a beautiful heart. ❤️
And now he's like 40       I just said it.
ah i love code names!
For anyone curious the other two books are The Plover by Brian Doyle, and Hallucinations by Oliver Sack.
4:04
i love this man so much always have always will
I wish he pulled out his Spiderman costume. That would’ve been crazy
In another life, Andrew Garfield is a Seattle tech bro because I’ve met so many with these exact interests 😂
What took you so long @GQ
What a delight! When can I come round for morning granola? Milk, no yogurt is fine by me xx
knowing that i’m never going to marry him it’s depressing
A celebrity you could actually have a nice conversation with. He seems like a lovely man who is really living his life. Good for him.
Andrew is one of the purest celebrities ever. And the fact that he doesn't like to sell products makes him even more admirable
Finally GQ, finally!! Ladies & gentlemen, Andrew Garfield.
Okay so how does he have so many hobbies while also being a crazy talented actor!! Kudos to you Andrew
How is this man real?
he looks different wow
new comfort video <333
he's truly the perfect combination of sophisticated and unhinged
imagine being on a flight and a shroomed-up Andrew Garfield asks you to play bananagrams with him
I missed what he was talking about because I spent 9 minutes asking myself how is he so perfect and what type of wedding gown to wear.
i would be surprised to find out he's NOT high in this interview
Can there be an Andrew Garfield book club please? I just finished reading a book he suggested in another interview-Making Movies by Sidney Lumet and it was great!
How can somebody look so old buy so young at the same time
What is in that granola!?
What I wouldn't give to have been that lady on the plane playing Bananagrams with Andrew Garfield.
We’re here for the Andrewssance. I hope he works with Jesse Eisenberg again.
Shout out Aero!
I truly love this man! He is unapologetically, authentically himself and it's so fun to watch his interviews and to just hear him talk
Deserves it all
Finally a more authentic one where not every single item is a product placement and says nothing about their personality
It’s like he was written to be perfect, like he just always has the most thoughtful or poignantly hilarious comment to every question
i love the way he explains things, you can see he's really interested in them. he has such a beautiful way with words and the way he gives everything a special meaning is so amazing to watch
y’all still won’t do tom holland
Finally a celeb who isn't just there to promote/sell brands, but instead Garfield actually even says that he doesn't want to sell brands. Respect. Was getting frustrating with the footballers and all their obvious endorsement deals.
i appreciate that he's like yea part of this series is sponsoring/selling you products
I am this man and this man is me
This bearded look is really doing it for me. I know he absolutely despised having long hair for some of his acting roles, but my fav is him rocking the side part with chin-length hair.  Nothing to do with the video. Just me shamelessly appreciating this man’s beauty as he ages. 🥰🥰  UPDATE: I’m halfway through this video and I cannot believe how adorably chaotic Andrew is talking about his stuff. There’s so much of his mum in him. She sounds like a beautiful soul who gifted the world with another beautiful soul—Andrew. 🐇❤️
He such an INFP personality type! 😂
Yeah this really shows how he is the perfect Remus Lupin
No one: Andrew casually going on a rant ab granola:
Just send like a dude you’d want to be friends with
We need one of these for Tobey and Tom
This will now be my most viewed video on YouTube
Glad Remus Lupin still has chocolate with him at all times
Someone get Jack Edwards to read these book suggestions!
Andrew: talks about getting food poisoning from yogurt Me: eating yogurt 😮
PLEASE WHY DID YALL HAVE HIM UP HERE WITH A BEARD AND CAUSE ME TO LOSE ALL FUNCTION
Who doesn’t love this man enter the chat…jk because this is section of people who love and respect Andrew Garfield PERIOD
He's so wonderful 🥺
Such a beautiful man.
i ran here 😂
The Remus Lupinificiation of Andrew💕💕
This man changed my childhood and i wanna thank him for that
Jack Edwards if you see this... I need a new episode of reading book celebrities recommended ;)
He’s just such a vibe 😂
Ugh, so disappointed to find out he does drugs. I liked him so much!
Lol when you think about some of the friends he plays "casual" ping-pong with
Andrew has won a Tony and still mixes up stage left and stage right and I find that both hilarious and very encouraging.
Not your regular essentials. Typical A.G. Plus, can this man get anymore attractive?!!!
Is that the same skateboard he used on the amazing spiderman?
This just makes me adore Andrew Garfield more than I do already
Whats with the shoes and the piece of clothing on the table at the end of the video 🧐?   (Also: of course weleda is cruelty free, too ;))
4:06
Whos this
I wanna be his surfboard
God I love that he’s just so unapologetically himself and so charismatic, it’s insanely attractive. Also the story about his mother & friendships, absolutely lovely. This man is a gem. ❤ Not to mention is he effortlessly hilarious 😂 He seems like that friend that’d have you laughing so much you’re in pain. Glad he’s getting all the love he deserves. 😊
He's awesome🐨
W video
i desperately need this man to start a podcast at some point
Love Andrew! Can we have Ben Barnes version of this video🙏🏻😅
pov: you play bananagrams with a high Andrew Garfield and now you’re married
Is my guy on the set of NOPE? where is my man at 💀
He can be such a d bag sometimes .. the surfboard
The granola😂
Every other 10 essential person: their phone, their watch, their bag Andrew: surfboard, board games, tennis racket, skateboard
ugh, Andrew I missed you.
little did we know he was on hallucinogens during this
I was waiting to be included in this video
So this is the bloke everyone on Twitter was hyping? Literally the most typical guy you’ll be meet at any uni. Sounds & looks like any other guy.
i love you 🥣👞🏄‍♂️🛹☕️📚📖📓⌚️📞🎓🕷👓
I love him SO much, and i too use Weleda skin food! hahah
I love his laugh
Is there a new meaning to the word 'essentials'?
Dream man 🖤
Alexa, add bananagrams to cart.
i miss Andrew and Emma so much,they were soulmatess🤧❤️❤️❤️❤️🥺
I would play bananagrams with you while we eat gramola with yogurt on top of the surfboard and many other things that moral ethics do not allow me to say...🎈
Love how he cheated about 16 "essentials" in there because he had multiples of a few of the "same" things. (edit: 17... He cheated 17 essentials in)  One more reason to love him... always delivering more than you expect. Woot!
he is so likeable and charming, also look like he is very funny... i love Andrew
What an adorable human being, i enjoyed every second of this video, i love him more than many of my familiars
He is essential.
Andrew is such a beautiful person, inside and out. ❤
the video pass so quickly, i want more!
I genuinely love this man. I love his smile, his sense of humour, his view of the world and other people, his intellect, his ability to pour his beautiful soul into everything he does, and his passion for his craft. I also love how anyone can tell, even through the screen, that he's one of the good ones. He deserves the world and I hope he's able to accomplish anything he sets out to do. 💜
1:50  "And uh.. you know, cut to... WE'RE MARRIED and the mother of my children-" ... "TSss.. that's not true."   That's ME when I think about this man
Love this dude!!
SHUT UPP THIS IS NOT REAL
andrew reading a book by ocean vyong. i love this man
MY FAVOURITE SPIDERMAN
favorite british person ever
Andrew is amazing ❤
I can imagine Jack Edwards going: “take that down! take that down!” at the book recommendations lol
Love this human, such a ray of sunshine ☀️
he forgot to mention me :((
I see a new @JackEdwards video
Anyone know where his shirt is from??
How can a person be so charismatic, funny and attractive at the same time?? Help??🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️
"is it essential? no, but it does make me feel happy to be alive" abt a pingpong racket is the most retable thing i've heard in a while
He is just so great, you could say he is Amazing
He's definitely one of the most goofiest and comedic celebs out there
I loved this one. The most interesting in a while. I’ll admit, I was getting pretty bored of the footballers ‘here’s my watch, football boots and wash bag’
I wanna be in his bag
my husband guys!
I love the thoughts he puts into this video to not make it “just one of those essentials videos which always feature some perfume etc.” (no offence to perfumes though. I love scents too) To me it applies to all of Andrew’s works too. They never feel “yet another”.  Andrew, I know you probably won’t read this, but have you read Babarian Days? A beautifully written book about surfing!
I love that some of his items are a kinda conceptual or literal necessities like food. Kinda captures the body and mind in that he seems like someone that can be in his head a bit but he’s purposeful about being connected and present by engaging with the world in a very physical way
This super spiritual surfer dude, health & wellness loving, wise and happy Andrew had me laughing and falling in love with him even more. Such a talented down to earth guy, What a blessing he is :) (Plot twist: He micro-dosed before this interview 😂)
I hope, he deserves to have  his  Spider man 3 .🤞
This is the best 10 essentials episode in the history of 10 essentials episodes. Thank you Andrew for opening your heart and sharing your stories ❤
I'm trying to do this for myself, you know 10 things i can't live without i only have 4 my phone my bed my pillow my gym, is that count , the gym  i don't have any sentimental attachment to anything, even those 3 things, get me any phone,bed,and pillow i still be happy
😍
I love this man
Vlaada Chvátil is one of the biggest names in boardgames. Kinda pathethic Of Garfield mispronouncing his name and mocking him, when he claims he's fan of his game. What a loser.
I love this man so muchhhhh
i love andrew so much 😩💕
He’s exactly how I worked expect him to be, cool guy!
Quien habrá sido esa "ella" 😢
A good episode after a long time.
He's really not beating these moony rumours with the chocolate
I love FINAL FANTASY🎉🎉
This video was all we ever wanted!!
Love. ❤
I love him what a great dude
@jackedwards thank you and you’re welcome
I really feel like I accidentally designed this man
why do i feel like he was also on mushrooms during this interview HAHHAHAHA love him sm
This is such a HOLLYWOOD list of stuff .........i'm honestly surprised he didn't pull out a moleskine journal
A suitcase of books .. Andrew Garfield is officially now my spirit animal ....
I see Andrew Garfield, I click.
Like I can’t be anymore in love with this man than I already am😅❤😍😭
Andrew Garfield: I don’t wanna sell stuff to people  me: *placing an order for weleda*
his interview always makes me love him more🤲🏻💗 and Andrew sniffed the books? and described why he loves these things😭 he’s funny, sentimental, and lovely✨✨✨
I think Zendaya and Andrew Garfield would make a fantastic casting in 50 shades of grey together
No bling. No superfluous thing. Just living. King. ❤
that minnie driver impression was… remarkably good.
first ten seconds of this video was pure whiplash
loml
he’s so unhinged i love him
THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO IT MADE ME SOSOSO HAPPY
It should be 10 things that can be practically carried.  Otherwise someone will say they can’t live without a couch.
I CANT BELIEVE YOU FINALLY MADE THIS CIDEO W ANDREW
The perfect man doesn't exis-
Is Andrew promoting anything right now? Don’t get me wrong, anything with Andrew is always welcome in my book but it feels kind of random.
How does one end up playing Bananagrams with a high Andrew Garfield on the plane?
The editing of these videos are getting better and better.
you can see he has Kyrie 7 bball shoes on the table! does he play basketball? and why wasn't that product shown?
Just realized Andrew Garfield is the biggest fking stoner -- Cosmic coincidence T-shirt, board games, ping pong, describing GRANOLA as "beautiful solitude", "surfboards are pieces of art themselves", Alan Watts, Oliver Sacks, custom skateboard, dark chocolate,  WELEDA??!!!
This video screams "no kids"
I love you Andrew you’re funny and sweet 🥰
Weleda = 🐐
Ilove You Andrew but i don't I understand  You accent 🤣🤣🤣♥️
Was hoping he was gonna share books and he did, very happy
Love him so much! 🥹❤️‍🔥
“What is real life, Vlaaada Chvatil” that got me. This interview was so jokes
I want Andrew as my therapist
playing bananagrams with andrew while high on a plane? new bucket list dream unlocked
And I can't live without Andrew Garfield 🥰
04:07 I don't even know what to say
The books are "The Plover" by Brian Doyle, "The Wanderers" by Wade Davis, "Hallucinations" by Oliver Sacks, "Just So" by Alan Watts, and "Time is a Mother" by Ocean Vuong. But what is the grey hardback?
i wanna play bananagrams with andrew on shrooms on a flight too wtf :(
I want to play board games with him
Bless you. Bless you person for blessing us with this video. Bless.
We love you Andrew ❤
