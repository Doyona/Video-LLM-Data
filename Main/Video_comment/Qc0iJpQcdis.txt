She soon sold it afterwards.
hello hanna. _A
3:46 Great job on credits but What was that tune?
My goodness Pretty Little Liars bought all that? Nice!
What does she do for a living? She hasn't don anything since PLL
❤
I’m impressed. This is exactly how my house would look like if I was a millionaire lol.
amazing 😍
I Love the kitchen, the black and white combo with the gold!
Hanna ❤
take a shot every time she says hotel
that laundry room is super weird
Love this house!!!❤
like like like like like. she needs to stop using that awful word so much. and this is just another never ending ad for some brands
Dried the Tillapia at the Marmont
❤😊,
Aww. She is beautiful and so is her house❤
Her voice is so raspy....still pretty though...😘

ADCouncil, 30:09.
I love this house, it's beautifully decorated and so inspiring.
Oh my girl got Money🥂🥂
beautiful
My top 10 hottest ABC Family girls.   1. Lucy Hale   2. Troian Bellisario   3. Ayla Kell   4. Shay Mitchell   5. Ashley Benson   6. Shailene Woodley   7. Cassie Scerbo   8. Maia Mitchell   9. Francia Raisa   10. Megan Park
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The bar in the bedroom is crazy haha i love it
no.
❤ Ame su perrito
What is it with celebs designing the perfect kitchen that they will never use?
This is one if my faves!!!🎉❤
Pretty Little Liars is literally the best television series in the world! I have all seven seasons of Pretty Little Liars on DVD and have been watching it since 2014. Best show ever! I love this video. The house looks amazing!
Ashley’s house is my favorite of this series. So much character, and curated impeccably.
impressive
The interior decor is sophisticated yet cozy, the perfect combination!
Any PLL fans freaking out over the “Hi, A.D.!”???
Okay but I’m obsessed with her backyard it’s like a dream
This has got to be one of the most boring tours of AD
Love you❤
Wow. That was beautiful 🤩
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Rich colors, very well thought out designs, unique pieces- I could go on and on. AMAZING! Love this!!! Thank you for sharing all of this color and art instead of a bland light-colored neutral place.
Your hand emmm .em
I love the point of taking a risk and every room and seeing how it’ll come out the colors are everything and these houses these houses just keep getting better thank you
Beautiful ❤️
she has a speak easy???!!!!

Uuhhu
Her kitchen is bigger than 90% people’s apartments:DDD
Thank you for letting us inside Ashley Benson.
I think she's copying Kendall Jenner
Her and Kendall Jenner house are so  similar
What a house ❤❤
Was anyone else going through and seeing if it was similar to Cara’s ?
I wonder if she got ptsd by saying A.D.
Hi AD -the irony (pll) if u know u know;)
her voice sounds so different now
It an honor to meet youashley benson 🙏🏿💯
She sold this house 10 days after showing it according to people magazine lol
wow she does not age! She's so gorgeous 🤩
She sounded differently now hahaha she sounded more mature. I always remember her as Hanna Marin.
“hi AD” any PLL flashbacks?
Ashley is such a Sagittarius
The bar in the bedroom that's actually for her candy is so funny to me and very real 😂
ugh LOVE that dining room
This girl has a tara reid type look
The only celebrity who showed her laundry room
Mansão  nos EUA.
Such a beautiful house
I’ve collected all these pots and pans and I will never use them. K.
It really does look like a hotel lol
Ven averme mi amor
I like her house. Im in love with her dining room
Hanna
This so her. I love Ashley
I love that she admits she has never used any of the copper pots and pans lol!
ashley benson - fem! niall horan 😂
Obsessed is an under statement
This house is not playful. It's extremely serious, actually.
In EVERY AD house tour I've watched so far, the stars never fail to mention their pot filler faucet & how they believe it makes their kitchen more legit it's hilarious haha
Every House I see I can't stop smiling when I look at them. Thank you AD.
my absolute favorite of all times
Pll 🥺 i love, beautiful house, much p Personality
AD video is so beautiful....
Who is this woman?
The Breville Coffee Machine. Australia’s finest !
I was hard the moment saw her
Harder!
Did she say "i love doing laundry" 🤨😂
Linda ❤casa
Coherent, purposeful, organized, welcoming, brilliant design altogether, just elegant!
THE LAUNDRY ROOM👽💕
I enjoy how almost strictly purposeful each room is. The "non-busyness" and elegant air about all the rooms is great too.
6:25 No TV in Living room, Bed room BUT in Bathroom. feels Adult?
It looks like a boutique hotel. I'm obssessed
Take a bath every morning while California is experiencing a huge drought coz...well I am a celebrity married to a heir.
who is she sooo beutiful and I loveee her dress..
*⚡🗽💖❤️💥❤️💖⚡* 0:52
Gorgeous taste 👏
how does she even have any money
hello Pretty Wonderful Ashley  and Family Whatever happen   you know. I love you so.Imiss    you so. wally Ph TGbtg ❤❤
Your dog swims very well! You should imitate! (lol) particularly during the winter. Did hear about the Cold Therapy? So lovely!
She keeps using past tense in the beginning like I was the third owner. So she doesn’t live there anymore?
When she said Nicole Gordon I had heard her say it before, but on Pretty Little Liars!! That was Ezra’s fiancée’s name!
I'd smash
Same ol ash lol, love you.
This house is amazing
colors, colors, more colors. I love it!!! there's an adult space (beige, white, mute) and there's mood rooms! I like the laundry room, it really is more fun when you play with small rooms. You transform it to something you like so you enjoy & look forward to those adult mundane tasks.
She is so sweet.
She dont have a TV but she have a cinema screen😂
...and I feel so lucky and privileged to be living in a rent controlled apartment in LA. :D
This was one of my favorite episodes
My favorite house so far ❤
i wouldn't use the word 'playful' to describe this space though
What a beautiful house I love it
No ones houses ever look like legitimate houses. They look like stage sets. Where do you put all your products and items like it’s never on display it’s crazy to me
She smoking hot😍😘👌🏼
She has nice taste 💯🔥👌🏼
"I love libaries"
She seems like such a kind genuine person. The way she talks about how she loves being with her friends, and the fact that she has long standing and new friendships is amazing.
I would love to stay in the at first room ngl!!
does she not have a shower
tedious....
This reminds me of Kendall’s house!
Would love to know where she got her glass cake stand/pastry case
Cool beautiful
Did she just do a faux pas. Did she just open the door and say, Hello ED???
It looks like the kendall jenner house
It's so funny how she sold this house after the AD video dropped 😂
dude, drought and stuff, but you be having a bath everyday
I love the design ! Is this the same designer as Kendall Jenner’s one ? The kitchen and living room disposition,  style and color look so similar.
Being in real estate or interior design in LA would probably be one of the most fun jobs in the world lol As long as you have an established practice.
I'm sorry but a white projector screen in a white room? the black levels must look horrible.
Ashley benson saying AD heheheh
I love Ashley so much 🌼. She’s gorgeous.
Where can I get that wallpaper in the ceiling of the speakeasy???
she s literally regina george...
Her house is a mix of hotels 😅
მთელი წელი გლოკავ გინდა  ?!
შედევრი ხარ
პატარა ბავშვივით მიმიჯენს ხოლმე  !
რა ფუნჯმა გამოგძერწა ასეთი  ?!
Wow each room so very different 🎉.  The one video that lifted my mood in 🥰 This is blissful.
One of a kind
She seems like one of those beauties who love rejecting guys
Kitchen ❤😍😍
That LAUNDRY ROOM!!!! 😍
Celebrity? Haven’t any idea whom this person is. Has the modern attitude, “look like you know what you’re doing” and “feel adult” while not having the mentality nor experience of one. The American way, poorly produced excess beyond and tons of rubbish.
😍
It is absolutely beautiful, but several  obvious copies of Kendall Jenner- but who can blame her.
Uhh have
0:18 does anyone know the name and designer of this lamp? thanks!!
Her backyard is so lovely♡♡♡
Why does every celebrity say that the kitchen is the most used room in their house?
How tf is a black dining room Parisian? 😂 I like her house but she's a bit cliche
😂😂😂😂😂😂 I also want the la cornue stove and pot filler, then build my kitchen around them😂😂. It’s my favorite stove.
ALL STAGED...    WE KNOW ALREADY
The one on Chrissy ?
i love how like every second thing she said was "yeah me and MY FRIENDS" like nobody is doubting you have friends, bestie, you can chill😭
It reminds me of one of the PLL sets.
not using those copper pots and pans is a disgrace
Even though this house was pre-owned 2 times, she still make it fit her ypu can see her personality in every space
Libarys
I wish I had a guest bedroom, to transform it into a closet,
Who is the art of the woman painting at 0:47?
This is not the style I would have expected her house to be….
I'm here for her purple eyes 🥰🥰
love love love
This is very "Hanna" of her
Loved this house ❤❤❤
why did they blur the painting?
The space wallpaper is also at Cap City Comedy Club in ATX👽 Love it after she mentioned Keegan who lives in Austin!
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Her house reminds me of Cara’s house.
Built in 1930! I'd never!
I LOVE ASHLEY PLEASE DO LUCY HALEEEE
She’s not only feeling as in a hotel. She has a hotel 😂 Beautiful decoration!
She’s so hot
That was a nice house tour! (minus the grazy laundry room wallpaper)
the vibe is very vampire’s house 😅🧛‍♀️
Apartaaaaaadaaaaaaa
Her outfit is giving Jenny Humphrey in the early seasons of Gossip Girl.
Love your house
Her voice has changed so much!
So funny since AD is Alison’s initials lol
she's so hanna marin coded
Wonderful
Ashley has expensive tastes.
И эта тварь - лизбейская пи$дит  что не увела у меня бабу, тойсть Кару Делявинчь!! !??? Да чтоб у тебя  язык отсох после таких слов!!!!!
Love the beauty and the beast room with the library. I wish I had that much storage space for my books!
Ashley, I love your house.   I wish it was mine😭😂
9:00 aww he did that Ashley?
7:20 the nightstands are floating? that's so cute
What is it that you could see if you looked close enough to the "flowers" on her ceiling?
Designed to perfection
👍
shes so gorgeous
Day 2488559 of waiting for Lana Del Rey’s house tour
que hace sola con una casa tan grande
de las mejores que vi
es muy hannah esa casa
Her house is beautiful & has great character! Loved her on PLL
Lush
looks like Kendal's house...
This is cringe. Space seems insincere and only for show. Not a fan. 😐
A bar in her bedroom...very Hannah like lol 😂
Hanna Marin would be so proud ❤
Very pretty house 🤎🤎
Nice fantastic
I wish hoyeon Jung would have one of these videos. Please do her next
How is she so rich? Is it PLL paying for all that?
Her house is stunning
Not a fan… I was hoping to love it
i really like her house it kind of reminded me of kendall jenner´s
Very nice
That laundry room wallpaper 😍
Hello kindly send me reward fast thankyou
Could you ask, please,  Halle Bailey to show her house?
Very nice
The outfit is giving Blair Waldorf vibes
Is it just me or her voice changed? Anyways love the house 🏘️❤️❤️❤️
I met her at a bar and she is literally the coolest girl ever and so so sweet!!! Love her!! Laid back queen Ash
She has incredible taste.
I am an architect and this is by far my fav house that AD showed us. This is gorgeous!!!
I mean this genuinely, not as a snide remark - who is she? What is she known for?
wow, this house felt like I was in a 1930's fancy film.. Probably one of my favortire house design! So homey!!
Spaces should feel like conversation pieces, combined with coziness and elegance. I think she has achieved it with this soace.
she lives like she's in a scene. i mean the kitchen is basically a scene in a movie and she lives like that as well. to have food as a prop to feel like something. TBH ALWAYS BEEN MY DREAM TOO CUZ LIKE I COULDNT EAT ALL THAT FOOD LOL!! VIBES!!
Phenomenal luxury finishes and quirky design
You are So Happy 🍄🍭
Her house will now be even bigger she’s engaged to an oil heir
It looks so calming. 💕
Stunning!!!
Super
I am not exagerating at all when i say my whole apartment fits inside the shelved guest room...😬
when she said "donut" I thought of PLL.
One of the nicest homes I’ve ever seen
Great content
Nice house
She's Just stunning ✨✨ Love ❤ her voice as well
Omg PLL series, I love it!
This house is so pretty and has so much character
I love the vibe of this house!
I would love doing laundry too in a laundry room like that
I have no idea who she is hahaha but I loved her house. Very pretty
so what is the wallpaper at 12:12??
the only successful thing she did was pretty little liars. Where did she find the money for this house?
A sconce is a new term for me lol 😂 🇬🇧
😂
how she afford this? my girl has not been booked or just in a minute
this is absolutely IT.
Reminds me of Nina dobrevs and vanessa hudgens place. Very similar vibes
Nice place, Han - A
so many windows for A to peek in👀
not her bathroom being like the dollhouse episode of PLL hahaha
its literally perfect in every way
“Hi AD”  *PLL war flashbacks*
Is anyone else just out here wanting to know why that one kitchen drawer is open?
Lovin this house 2nd best house I've seen so far
one of the best - in every possible way - houses i have ever seen! i am in love 😍🤩
She definitely does not do her own laundry
Lol honestly I feel like she is so lost and fake and confused and and so many aspects of this house is really her pretending to be something she’s not. Don’t like it for her …
The classic Lime’s bowl in every AD kitchen …
Her hair needs some natural balayage, it's giving Paris Hilton. Very much in love with the outfit, though. The house is stunning, obviously. 😊
just found my favourite house ......WOWW
Well decorated house😍🤑
Ashley you are so cool...love your house.
Her house really match her idk how to explain that it just do 😂
What a beautiful house! I wonder what is she doing for a living these days
Life’s not fair
Her house is stunning😊
I’m obsessed 😍
Beautiful!!
I wonder if she’ll sell. Now she’s getting married.
kitchen is almost same with kendal jenner
must be terrible living in LA
It's GORGEOUS and exactly my style!!! I want a house like this
Gaaaaah that laundry room wallpaper is the background on my phone rn!!!! She’s living my best life 😂
Who is she?
Bland.
I'm shooketh. Literally all of the PLL's look almost exactly the same today being in their mid-late 30s as they did in PLL.
That was fun!  🤗👌🌹
I love the finishes and this style of tour
She truly is Hanna Marin 😂
What lipstick does she have on here????
I adore this house- very playful and yet tastefully done. LOVE.
Hanna M. at her best
It's a beautiful house. I'm in love with the closet 😍
either shes a pick me girl or has no friends bc she keeps saying my friend, my friends, my friends
Nice
To me, the celebrities houses are all the same haha same style, especially the kitchen
The bar in the bedroom hahaha I love it!! I keep bottles of wine and spirits in my bedroom, so really relate to this 😅
🫶🤘💐
For someone who is 32 she surely has a lot of friends over all the time. How is that possible. 😂🥹
Awesome video
So much character! I love the thoughtful touches. She and her designer did such a lovely job
ashley you have nice hair eyes
nice pool i have a pool too really great video nice dog shes a nice person too
Brave New World how sad...
I giggled at the candy drawer, very iconic
I love this. Inspired. Remind me of the luxury Nashville realtors...
She's still Hannah Marin 😍
Never in my life did I thing she'd ever  open and  invite A.D Into her house 🤯 🙈🙊        If u know, u know 😂😂😂
Yeah of course it's boring.
And she's NOT a blonde or a schoolgirl, what is with the outfit?
Gorgeous lady, gorgeous house!
i love her
LOVEEEE THE KITCHEN...DINING ROOM ELEGANT BUT...TOO DARK ,at night must be great...
One Of The Best I’ve Seen. 😍😍
Nice
Soooo beautiful ✨
Thanks for your house tour video. I feel better after watching it
Thumbs up
Anyone know what that ceiling wallpaper design is “if you look closely” 👀??
Her bathroom 😍😍😍
It’s so beautiful 😍
This was kinda Basic 😩
Love this tour. Thanks for sharing
I love Ashley Benson she is a great actress.🤩
Oh look another actress who hates LA 🙄  bet you were dying to make it as an actress in LA before you did !
👍👍👍👍
I love the laundry room. Such a dope spot.
Yes
Nice
Love it ! But I wish they would say what area/section of LA !
I love how each room has its own personality
What was that thing above the stove? Like a handbar..
If this tour had been done at night... it would've given that spectacular dining room the moment it deserves. Wow. Loved it
OMG THAT KITCHEN!!! And OMG I can't believe she doesn't use those spectacular pots and pans. Painful! Give them to me, I'll use them every day! Lol!
Has anyone figured out what the wallpaper in her speakeasy is?
I love that Ashley (Hanna Marin) worked with a designer with the same name as a PLL character (Nicole Gordon)!
loved it!!!!
It’s similar to Vanessa Hudgens place ..🙈
She loved that house so much, she just sold it two days ago.
Nice video 👍
I love this
that window reading nook is awsome! :D
que linda mi novia
Wow i love how much character have this house! Beautiful beautiful beautiful 💖✨️
i love her nancy meyers kitchen, her space wall paper and everything paris inspired... love her taste! Its mature, but still playful.
i love doing laundry too. I wish I had a laundry room like that!
Not Earth friendly at all, OMG!
Ashley: Hi AD Me having a flashback of PLL7: 👁️👄👁️
BEAUTIFUL house 🎉🎉you HAVE
i lovee her so much
It would be interesting to see the rooms, but it is cut in a weird way
Everrything about this house is just perfect, i love it
I wonder where is the item that she bought with Cara Delevigne that one time
Fave house so far!
Her house is very coherent. Every room has this casino/ office/ hotel vibe that mix together.
I need Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra house!
That house is haunted 😮
"I do keep pastries all the time because I feel like it looks pretty"... WTF 🤦
Kristen Stewart please AD
Kendall Jenner house vibes, but more navy and european
very nice
LA really is a shithole when the ultimate dream of a house in LA, is to feel like it's not in LA. 😂
the spaces are so well decorated, and that reading nook!
Amazing house, thank you for sharing ❤
Not the interior style I normally go for, but this really inspired me! The hotel feel, the playfulness but not busy as she said - it's really beautiful and inviting! Also really love the way the combined different colors and patterns with classic textures!
I love the way she talks, not like those kardashians and other spoiled brat rich girls.
the laundry wallpaper is so cool
it fits her personality!! LOVE IT. Definitely one of the most unique houses I love it.
LOVE.
It’s giving Cara vibes.
The kitchen, living room and bathroom legit looks like Kendalls
I love this woman
idk what it is, but I hate this. Everything feels so trickle-down and trendy and basic.
Hanna ! ❤
I’m obsessed with her personality
Wait is this Kendal Jenner’s house?
Ahh to be engaged to a billionaire's grandson.....
Please do gigi Hadid or bella
“I don’t like busy!” and than there’s the Star Wars wallpaper!😳
Of all the AD house tours that I've seen, this one is my favorite.
I really like Ashley Benson's house. I feel in love with her bathroom. It is a place I could "live in".
Is there an Ikea for rich people or why do those houses all look the same lmao
Love this house
Me trying to figure out her perfumes
she's giving Jenny Humphery
Is it just me or does the music sound a bit ‘horror vibes’? Great house though and I love Ashley
Another house filled with charm - love all the colour
the flowers everywhere the mix if colors and the lights omg it is so feminine and modern with a retro touch im obsessed
Ok I wanna be her friend. 😂
I don’t know who she is but I freaking love her house!!
top 2 & not number 2
slaying per usual
*looks at bathtub* "This was really really important to me. I really just wanted something different and so I got this."
She did not say LIBARIES 🤣🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
Another naff generic  house
Came to the comments to say that I wholeheartedly thought this was Amanda Steele, omg.
But, if not flowers, what is the wallpaper on the ceiling?
Is she still living there even though she’s engaged
She got even prettier
:)
She did her big one with this! ❤
That is the best house I have ever seen on Architectural Digest... LOVE IT!
Land Scalping and House Keeping
Show me your favorite room? 😊
I love her house it’s giving 1940s vibes😍😍
🙄
You really think people are so stupid, and won't notice the exact same sentence about the kitchen tap that another actress said in one of these videos. Now we know it's 100%: scripted and fake. Nice.
Ashley Benson is very beautiful and very rich. I like her house, and it seems she's very kind. 😊🩷
The arched doors are my true dream, so lovely! :)
Ooh love this one
Kitchen is the most important place despite I don't cook at all, like ever - makes sense
One of my my favorite homes on AD. <333
People in LA talking about their fire gives me a little giggle every single time it happens
the dog is so cute but he is big so your hardwood floor will get scratched up badly.  I have the same dog.
Best house EVER! WOW! Love the moody rooms!
I don't know why I click on these, they are so impersonal and boring
What happened to her voice?
The bathroom looks like a prison. Everything else is beautiful.
I feel like it’s comedy watching celebrities try to describe their living spaces… just not intelligent conversation lol
The kitchen reminds me of her house in PLL 😂
criiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinge
this house interior and vibe look like kendall jenner s house
FANTABULOUS 💝💝
Expensive
Most people venture into crypto to be wealthy,meanwhile I just want to be debt free.
Italy, Barcelona, Paris, Cabo… this place’s references are all over the shop and it’s reflected in the overall design. Can we also please just stop with blue+marble farmhouse kitchens already?
@wasselpa I love this house decoration, I'd be so interested in your opinion on this one! (I'm sure you'd love the night shelves ahah)
WOW this is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!😁😁
that wallpaper on the ceiling..🫢🍆
in a house like this one i would have loved to see what it looked like when it's dark outside + with all the lights on inside!
GUYS WHY ASHLEY BENSON ISN’T CONSIDER FOR BARBIE MOVIE? SHE IS THE REAL LIFE BARBIE, LOOK AT THE EYES, THE SHAPE OF HER FACE, THE HAIR, MOUTH…
See you next Thursday
Just you wait till I'm moneyed!
its so hanna marin
Fell in love with Ashley again, as soon as she showed the bar in her bedroom 😅
i like
" I love doing laundry" lol
I loved the original parts of the House... beautiful
bet you don't clean it yourself ,
😍
Cool girl house for sure, lucky 🍀
THAT'S A NICE HOUSE!
SHE IS BEAUTIFUL!
HER HOUSE IS NICE!
That copper tub will lose heat so fast lol
IT'S ASHLEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love her guest room so much more than her bedroom 😅
2 liars down. 3 more to go. AD goes PLL. 👌
😍
Love that she has style, character and also kept the original features of this house. I love this place. The kitchen is amazing, but I can see how this style will run it's course.
i'm going to be Macy some day 😆
Nice
The house is definitely beautiful but also feels wasteful in ways. Having fireplaces going 24/7, taking a bath every day even if it’s very briefly, installing such an expensive kitchen when you don’t know how to cook. Obviously celebs have more money and they can spend it how they want, but it would be nice to keep in mind sustainability and also how privileged they are. The way she wastes materials and money almost felt like bragging.
this is so bad
this is so perfect🥳🥳🥳🥳❤❤
I feel like she is more concerned with how things look and comes across than what she likes and who she is as a person. Beautiful house tho! 🎉
Woah, how superficial can one be. Everything just for the looks huh.
I hope she actually eats those pastries or uses the room with the fireplace constantly on. Otherwise its just rich person excess
No don’t don’t post this! It helps A know the layout and stuff. Hanna be careful boo.
I like it! The colour combos are interesting too.
I love her whole look
My additional goals for my dream house- have a dicky flowers as wallpaper ❤
The worst extensions
Why is racial conflict always the answer?
Stunning house, but is just me or do you see a resemblance to Kendall Jenner’s house. The green kitchen, the copper bath tub, the James Turrel looking artwork etc….? Just wondering
Never thought I would say it in a house tour, but the laundry room is clearly my favorite 😅
I love libarees
Who?
Who is Ashley Benson? HOW can she afford this? Bizarre..
Designed to perfection!
take a drink every times she says me and my friends hangout here...
She’s so pretty and so is her house.
I LOVE IT SO MUCH!
ashley’s style is everything
Mirrors on ceilings and that wallpaper choice was disturbing (tell me you can see what she’s referring to in the red “romper room “  ICK
Love her outfit and shoes
Celebs like this get on my nerves so much b/c they are always staging things so much – just like how Dakota Johnson lied in her AD tour and told everyone she LOVED limes and had them on her kitchen counter and later on Jimmy K show, tells us it was just for show and that she is allergic to limes! WELL THEN WHY LIE IN THE FIRST PLACE? This staging and acting and lying works in a film or TV show but THIS IS REAL LIFE! SO BE REAL!
I have no idea who she is, but she seems to be doing well - love the pool 💙
So beautiful..I friggin love these
Best laundry room
😂❤candy drawer on bar..love it
Looks like taylor momsen.
You’ll always be Hanna to me 💕
IDK who this chick is, a bit on the airhead side, but I like the house and the decorating.
A bar in her room and then a separate bar room… wow. I thought she had a drinking problem w few years ago?
my mom
So she didn’t even mention the James turrell art on her wall?!
No idea who she is....
It’s the extensions for me
I was amazed by everything in this house. I loved how Ashley’s house wasn’t the typical “nude and blush” and how it was super fun yet cohesive. Def took a lot of screenshots throughout the video!
Hanna Marin would be proud.
she’s so adorable!!!!
With a creative floor plan like this, you can get the idea of abundant lifestyle. There're so much beauty in this place. 😍✨
LOVE YOU ASHLEY!! ❤
lol at these celebrities "I absolutely needed this pot filler....I've never used it, I don't cook."
ashley!!!! love her
I love every little bit of this house!😍
Amazinggg
Cool
Meh
Wow, this house is unbelievably gorgeous & unique, just like Ashley is. Great taste & design inside & outside.    I am obsessed with it.
I love when celebrities say they love their “small spaces” but the bathroom is the size of my living room and kitchen combined LOL
ive never seen, nor heard of this person in my life.
I love her bedroom, looks so clean and cozy, but still has a bit of a retro feel with the nightstand and velvet headboard.
MOTHER SINCE FOREVER
I now hate the phrase “very important to me” eye-roll!😵
HANNNNAAAAAA MARIIIINNNN 🤩🤩
Omg clicked so fast. I love her
why does it look like a copy of Kendal Jenner's house?
Hands down one of my favorite homes featured so far 😍
Who is she.?
How does she look so great considering all the pastry, candy & alcohol? 🤣🤣  I didn't see a gym in the house. She must run a lot or goes to a nearby gym, because she looks amazing. 🤔
the speakeasy is 🔥🔥🔥
Legitimately one of the best houses I’ve seen on the channel so far
Mama every celebrity interior looks the same these days ... so boring. Except Ru Paul !
Low key glam. I really like the style. Everything timeless. Kitchen was awesome. Maybe her friends cook in it.
Please speak up loud to these politicians so that the many homeless can have decent shelter.  Social Housing is a great solution.  This is the richest country in the world.  We can do it!
I love her house! Definitely my biggest inspiration for homes so far👏🏽
Omg that dining room!!! 👀👅🍻
Lol is it just me or has she copied SO much of kendall jenners house? The kitchen is almost identical except for colour, the lounge room, the art, the statement tub
I would love to know what that shelf is above the stove.
obsessed with the dining room!!!
she nailed the bedroom, it reallly did feel like a boutique hotel
Wow!!! Perfect 👍😍✌😁😊
I LOVEEE her house so much I've been waiting for this one for so longgg
I feel like her house is just the utimate definition of Curated. & everything has a purpose. LOVE IT
Kendall Jenner changed the world of interior design
Very expensive, well thought out interior but also uninspiring and a little boring. Her house looks like a lot of other celebrity houses. Maybe AD should do non-celebrity house tours.
Omg is AD 😉doing the whole pll cast?
Probably my favorite house on here
Ashley would have loved to be a Beta in 'Brave New World'
She, as any other celebrity, is probably a socialist. Against capitalism and blah blah blah....
..."Hi, AD!" Why did that make me emotional?
She is and will always be everythingggggg 🥰
Gorgeous interiors
This was beautiful, a lot of character!
Ashley's so pretty it hurts my eyes.
What’s upsetting about ashley is she publicly mocked amber heard and praised johnny depp
Loved it ❤
I love her closet 🎉😍
It looks like Little J has fully evolved into Taylor Momsen :)
I love your style and use  of colour!
Definitely one of the most unique houses I love it
the PLL fan in me dying at the opening line “hey AD!” 😭
This is such a gorgeous house, it low-key looks like Kendall Jenners house but better so I’m not mad at that.
it's a nice house but definitely my least favourite episode as everything is set up for the purpose of "I like how this looks so I have pans I don't use" and "it looks mature". 🤷🏼
I love everything but the kitchen- (sink)
She’s so gorgeous
WITH WHAT MONEY
all houses look the same
I just wanna be a rich person to have a house like this 😂😢😢
Ashley is a not easy to read person you know and I love that about her. And so I literally watched the vid with an open mind. And by far is my favorite house!! Love love love all the wallpaper and darkness. ❤
That awesome house.
Who is she? Such a generic kitchen.
Love the kitchen. I have the same stove. I designed it around the LaCornue.
Boyfriends money
She needs to change that blonde hair asap
I guess red(ish) rooms are back in style!
6:46 Toilet open ??  WHY? Not a habit in Europe...
What an absolute great girl and personality, What a marvelous house, and: I am making a bar in my bedroom too!! Why not ?! ✨💞
Who is she? Would change the bath tub. Fresh flowers everywhere. Nobody lives like that. Bathing everyday? Fireplaces in california? Yikes
Loved that she said ´´hi AD´´ lol
another pretentious unused kitchen in a celebrity home...i thought this channel is ARCHITECTURAL Digest not People magazine..
This gal and this house are a reason to move to L.A.
That pretty little liars money must hit different! I love her house 😍
nice, you living with cara? there?😚
I like the decor, but I really feel like she bought the house just because of its architecural pedigree. It's not for her.
So gorgeous!!!
Lol HEY "AD"
All these AD tours looking the same. Can we please get some more original designs
The variety of style in each room is great. Very satisfying to explore each one.
shes so beautiful
Red room😍
Ashley B on AD!!!
I love Ashley
she's hot
WOW ♥️
She said that she feels like she is in barcelona but im in barcelona and i dont find the similarity btw 😅
Love her and love her house but what i love the most is that the outfit screams PLL❤❤❤
"It was very important to me..."
I dont know why but ı feel the same vibe with kendall jenner ‘s house .
nice
Can you do a tour of Stevie wonders house?
I liked the guest room with the library a lot. Usually it seems that celebraties don't own 'usual' stuff, but there we go: a second hand vinyl collection! (or at least it looked like second hand)
Firstly, and in the nicest way ever, who is this lady? Secondly, why? (also in the nicest way ever)
Beautiful ❤
It takes a LOT to impress me after being in design, interiors and renovations of many houses over MANY years. WOW! This is just gorgeous!
This Is My Favorite Girl!!
Gorgeous house
I looked her up only to discover she flipped the property for a huge profit. The video has lost its appeal now.
classy, classy gal
Who even is that?  But yeah, you can tell these people don't clean their own homes or they wouldn't stage them like this. Full-time job for sure.
Wait - the Dog designed the interior? That is what she said.
Love her and her style
What is the laundry room wall paper?
Who is this girl? Never heard of her.
I miss PLL
Ashely being a sagittarius and wanting to incorporate her travels into her house just makes sense
It’s like a moody Nancy Meyers. I love it.
I hate Hate Hate that the art is blurred.
Who is Ashley Benson? The decor is just very dated. With all the bleaching she does to her hair, she is gonna go bald.
What are the flowers on the ceiling supposed to look like? 😶
This was kinda boring.. The house is beautiful but the way it is presented is not really interesting
lmao she caled you E.D
Do they have to remove all traces of everyday living? They always look like showrooms which is a bit meh...
I’m in Love 🖤
So the woman basically recreated a mix of all hotel rooms she's ever been in 😂
I love her house !!!..its so fun and perfect
Don’t have a kitchen like that (stove, pot filler, pots and pans like those) if you don’t ever plan on learning how to cook. For those of us who can only dream of your kitchen, it’s a real f-you to us
Navy, mustard, and blush. ✅
I loved this house. Has so much personality and is beautiful/ fun/ unique etc. She seem like she be a great friend! ❤
Where can I find that gold leaf naughty wallpaper she had on the ceiling in her speakeasy?? 12:05 - 12:13
what is the detail in the flowered ceiling ??
Beautiful ❤❤❤❤❤
💓💓💓🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Hi “AD” omg pll
Hannah banana  ❤
🌹Very Beautiful  🌹
My favorite house in the world ❤
Wait, is she still relevant?
Is it just me or her house has the same vibe as Kendall's house? Especially the formal living room
Omg Ashley you are SO beautiful!
"Hi A.D." -  hannah?
This was great 👍🏾
Laundry room wallpaper- yesss
I think I just watched the next trailer to ‘Dumb & Dumber.’
Ahh I was just watching pretty little liars for the 100th time ❤love her even tho she can be rude in the show but that’s fine 😂❤❤❤
What an absolute waste of an awesome kitchen.
using food for decoration, interesting 🤔
Kinda reminds me of Kendall's house
Poor People are dying of jealousy
we need a Taylor Swift version
Colourful and moody house. I like it!
Unlikable and fake
Such mature taste ❤
dang she is really irritating lol it seems like she has few interests or hobbies besides spending money and being perceived as an 'adult' which apparently is just having expensive taste.
I love this house. Very tasteful ❤.
Finally, iv been waiting on an new episode of this 😭😭
As if I couldn’t love her more! She is a true class act ❤❤❤
this is divine!
Que lindo closet
It pains me when these celebrities have such beautiful kitchens/pans etc and don't even know how to cook  🥲
I think the house has no theme and did not achieve its purpose
Very chic! It’s so nice to see all the colors throughout. Very chic and sophisticated. Love it.
Looks like a hotel 4 ⭐️
Love this tour. Thanks for sharing ❤
Who?
Doesn't seem like it's 'her' taste, a lot of it is just to impress others
the way this is edited gives me a headache
I swear mod sun is the only celeb I have seen with a normal house filled with cool things. Almost all of these vids are just ads to tax the rich.
So American having a bunch of things she doesn’t know what they’re meant for, using food as decoration “to give an impression” and low key bragging about having visited a single city in Europe for a day.
I love it when we get dark rooms in these tours! White and beige get so boring.
Designed to perfection! 🩵
I love the black dining room ! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I was wondering how an actress that was on a semi popular tv show 10 years ago would afford this house... turns out shes married to a billionaire's grandson
who
Its quirky but homey
all lovely.....plastic flowers tho??????
sometimes I think the most favourite word of Americans is: "amazing!"
she is so iconic for the "hi AD"
love ittttt
I love her kitchen!!!!!!
mid design, but I love her
Hello how are you doing today and how are you feeling
Looks like Kendall Jenner and Vanessa Hudgens homes
OMG!
Girl look like seller in shoes bootik
So she wants her bedroom to feel like a hotel & also her laundry room like a store? that seems so strange to me
it fits her personality!! LOVE IT
Always entertaining to see that "celebrities"—btw, have no idea who this woman is and why she even is in the video—have an elaborated expensive kitchenware as decoration only and hardly use it or cook themselves. They look non-authentic and as a form over substance themselves this way.
Celebrities talking about their 'relaxing' space when they never actually do anything.
Love this house, you have fabulous taste.
when a "celebrity" brags about never using pots or pans but collects them... ✌
❤❤❤
Who cares, stop worshipping celebrities. We as a people need to come together and get rid of these rich and annoying celebrities. Rise up
Beautiful & classy.
so cute!
I'd play with her in there.
Queen 💖
❤️🌹
Lovely 🤩
Wow!!
It looks a lot like Kendall Jenner’s house
Who cares
Phenomenal luxury finishes and quirky design!
